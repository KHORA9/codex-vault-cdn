Kerner of Innspruck has lately adduced some facts\r\nbearing on the question of the transport of seeds by the wind, having\r\nexamined the collections of animal and vegetable substances found\r\non the icy surfaces of glaciers and the plants growing on moraines.\r\nJudging from the facts thus obtained, he attributes but a small\r\ninfluence to this agency, as the specimens discovered belonged to\r\nthe fauna and flora of the immediate vicinity, and not one of these\r\nspecimens must needs have come from a distance. See abstract of his\r\npaper in Gardener's Chronicle, Feb. 3, 1872, p. 143, and in 'Nature'\r\nfor June 27, 1872, p. 164.]\r\n\r\nAs I listened, the question occurred to me whether the ants, which\r\nI had observed carrying seeds to their nests at Mentone, might not\r\nbe unconscious agents on a small scale, both in the distribution\r\nand the subterranean storing of seeds. When at a later time I made\r\nthis suggestion to some of our leading naturalists, I learned with\r\nconsiderable surprise that the unanimous opinion of our highest\r\nmodern authorities on the subject is opposed to the belief that\r\nEuropean ants ever do systematically collect and make provision\r\nof seeds, and that the instances of such occurrences in tropical\r\nclimates remain as isolated though undoubted facts which it is\r\ndifficult to explain.\r\n\r\nI was not then aware that towards the middle of last century the\r\nancient belief, dating from the time of Solomon, that ants habitually\r\nshow forethought and husbandry in the collection of supplies of seeds\r\nand grain had begun to be called in question, and that our most able\r\nobservers, such as Huber, Gould, Kirby and Spence, and at the present\r\nday Mr. Frederick Smith, had by close scrutiny of the habits of these\r\ncreatures proved that, wherever personal investigation had enabled\r\nthem to put the matter to proof, no trace of harvesting was found.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: I have myself on many occasions thrown seeds in the\r\ntrack of the common English ants, and my experience was, up to the\r\npast summer (1872), similar to that of the above-named naturalists,\r\nbut I have lately, by the merest chance, become acquainted with\r\na curious exception to this rule. It happened as follows. I was\r\ngathering some fresh capsules of the common sweet violet in a garden\r\nat Richmond, near London, and in pouring the seeds out of my hand\r\ninto the paper bag made to receive them, a few were spilled on the\r\nground. In a short time afterwards I was greatly surprised to see\r\nsome of these spilled seeds in motion, being carried by the common\r\nblack ant (_Formica nigra_) into its nest. On seeing this I hastened\r\nto get some more fresh violet seeds, and also a quantity of seeds\r\ntaken from ant's granaries at Mentone, and scattered these where the\r\nother seeds had lain. After watching for half an hour a few of the\r\nviolet seeds were carried in, but not one of the granary seeds was\r\nremoved, though these were examined with some curiosity. I repeated\r\nthis experiment twice afterwards on a distinct colony of ants of the\r\nsame kind and obtained exactly the same result. I opened the nest of\r\nthe former colony on the day after they had carried in the seeds, but\r\nfailed to find these or any stores of other seeds.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that the ants took these seeds believing them\r\nto be larvæ of other ants which they might eat; for fresh seeds\r\nof violet are not very unlike the larvæ of certain ants, as, for\r\nexample, those of _Atta barbara_, figured at Plate I., Fig. E., p.\r\n21, the semi-transparent membranous appendage partly concealing the\r\nseed and giving it a fleshy appearance.\r\n\r\nI think this the more likely because on two occasions the seeds which\r\nhad been carried into the nest were subsequently thrown out by the\r\nants, which had I believe discovered their mistake.]\r\n\r\nHowever, just as the ancient writers, judging from their own\r\nexperience and from the reports of others, had erred in attributing\r\nto ants in general the habit of seed-storing possessed by certain\r\nspecies commonly found in the south, so have modern naturalists\r\nfallen into the mistake of denying it to any of the European species.\r\n\r\nThe older authors who lived in Greece and Italy, and the mediæval\r\nauthors who drew their information in great measure from the former,\r\nbeing familiar with the fact that some ants habitually collect large\r\nsupplies of seed, went so far as to assert, or to imply, that all\r\nEuropean ants do so; the authors of the present day, on the other\r\nhand, generalizing too freely from their experience of ants found\r\nnear their northern homes, maintained and maintain the very reverse.\r\n\r\nSo long as Europe was taught natural history by southern writers the\r\nbelief prevailed; but no sooner did the tide begin to turn, and the\r\ncurrent of information to flow from north to south, than the story\r\nbecame discredited.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting now to recall a few of the allusions to the\r\nharvesting ants made by ancient authors, some of which contain\r\ntolerably accurate accounts of what was to them a familiar sight or a\r\nuniversally accepted fact.\r\n\r\nThe passages in Proverbs[3] are the following: \"Go to the ant, thou\r\nsluggard: consider her ways and be wise; which, having no guide,\r\noverseer, or ruler, provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth\r\nher food in the harvest.\" \"The ants are a people not strong, yet they\r\nprepare their meat in the summer.\" Hesiod[4] speaks of the time\r\n\r\n       \"When the provident one (the ant) harvests the grain.\"\r\n                      ὅτἐ τ ιδρις σωρὀυ ἁμαται.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: vi. 6-8 and xxx. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Works and Days, 776.]\r\n\r\nHorace[5] also alludes to the foresight of the ant, who is \"haud\r\nignara ac non incauta futuri.\" Virgil[6] compares the Trojans\r\nhastening their departure to harvesting ants, and the passage has\r\nbeen thus rendered by Dryden:--\r\n\r\n                \"The beach is covered o'er\r\n    With Trojan bands, that blacken all the shore:\r\n    On every side are seen, descending down,\r\n    Thick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town,\r\n    Thus, in battalia, march embodied ants,\r\n    Fearful of winter, and of future wants,\r\n    T' invade the corn, and to their cells convey\r\n    The plundered forage of their yellow prey.\r\n    The sable troops, along the narrow tracks,\r\n    Scarce bear the weighty burden on their backs;\r\n    Some set their shoulders to the ponderous grain;\r\n    Some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train;\r\n    All ply their several tasks, and equal toil sustain.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Satires I. i. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Æneid, Bk. iv. l. 402.\r\n\r\n    \"Ac velut ingentem formicæ farris acervum\r\n    Quum populant, hiemis memores, tectoque reponunt:\r\n    It nigrum campis agmen, prædamque per herbas\r\n    Convectant calle angusto; pars grandia trudunt\r\n    Obnixæ frumenta humeris; pars agmina cogunt,\r\n    Castigantque moras; opere omnis semita fervet.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\nIndeed, it would seem that among the people inhabiting the shores\r\nof the Mediterranean it was almost as common to say \"as provident\r\nas an ant\" as it is with us to say \"as busy as a bee.\" Plautus[7]\r\nintroduces a slave who, when attempting to account for the rapid\r\ndisappearance of a sum of money of which he had charge, says,\r\n\r\n                                      \"Confit cito\r\n    Quam si tu objicias formicis papaverem.\"\r\n\r\n                        \"It vanished in a twinkling,\r\n    Just like poppy seed thrown to the ants.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Trinummus, Act ii. sc. 4, l. 7.]\r\n\r\nAny one who has seen the eagerness with which certain southern ants\r\nseize upon seeds thrown in their path will appreciate the correctness\r\nof this simile.\r\n\r\nClaudius Ælianus, who lived in the time of Hadrian, gives a detailed\r\naccount of the habits which he attributes to ants,[8] from which the\r\nfollowing is a translation: \"In summer time, after harvest, while\r\nthe ears are being threshed the ants pry about in troops around the\r\nthreshing floors, leaving their homes, and going singly, in pairs, or\r\nsometimes three together. They then select grains of wheat or barley,\r\nand go straight home by the way they came. Some go to collect, others\r\nto carry away the burden, and they avoid the way for one another with\r\ngreat politeness and consideration, especially the unburdened for\r\nthe weight carriers. Now these excellent creatures, when they have\r\nreturned home, and stored their granaries with wheat and barley, bore\r\nthrough each grain of seed in the middle; that which falls off in the\r\nprocess becomes a meal for the ants, and the remainder is unfertile.\r\nThis these worthy housekeepers do, lest when the rains come the seeds\r\nshould sprout, as they would do if left entire, and thus the ants\r\nshould come to want. So we see that the ants have good share in the\r\ngifts of nature, in this respect as well as others.\" Further on[9]\r\nhe gives a very interesting account of their mode of collecting and\r\npreparing the grain, many details of which I can myself substantiate\r\nfrom personal observation, though I have never seen ants actually\r\nat work upon the ears of corn. \"But when the ants start a foraging,\r\nthey follow the biggest, who take the lead as generals. And when\r\nthey come to the crops, the younger ones stand under the stalk, but\r\nthe leaders ascending gnaw through the culms, as they are called\r\n[ὀυραγοὑς, 'the stalk ends on which the ears grow' (Lid. and Scott,\r\nGr. Lex.)], probably meaning that they detach the separate spikelets\r\nof which the ears are composed], of the ears [καρπἱμων], which they\r\nthrow to the people below. These busy themselves with cutting away\r\nthe chaff and peeling off the envelopes which contain and cover the\r\ngrain. So the ants, though they need no threshing time, nor men to\r\nwinnow for them, nor an artificial draught of wind to separate corn\r\nand chaff, yet have the food of men who both plough and sow for it.\"\r\nÆlian appears also to have heard reports of the habits of ants in\r\ntropical countries, for he says,[10] \"Certainly the Indian ant is\r\nalso a wise creature.... They leave one opening at the top (of the\r\nnest), by which they have their exits and entrances, when they come\r\nbearing the seeds which they collect.\" I have never myself found\r\nseeds bored through the centre in the way recorded above, but it is\r\npossible that different species of ants may treat the seeds in other\r\nways than those observed by me; or, on the other hand, Ælian may have\r\nmistaken the gnawing off the radicle of the seed, a process which I\r\nshall describe from personal observation below, and imagined that the\r\nseed itself was pierced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Ælian, De Naturâ Animalium, ii. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Ælian, De Nat. Anim., lib. vi. chap. xliii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Id. lib. xvi. 15.]\r\n\r\nAldrovandus, writing in the sixteenth century, speaks[11] of the ants\r\nas storing seed and of their gnawing, \"illud principium seu acumen\r\ngrani, è quo germen emitti à tritico solet\"--that is to say, the\r\nradicle. But it is not clear whether Aldrovandus treats of what he\r\nhas himself seen or refers to the account given by a certain Bishop,\r\nSimon Mariolus, who, he says \"in his most pleasant and learned work,\r\nintroduces a philosopher as taking his walks abroad and examining an\r\nant's nest with its seed store,\" &c.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Aldrovandus, De Insectis, lib. v. (de Formicis).]\r\n\r\nThe lively fable of the ant and the grasshopper, as related by La\r\nFontaine, has done much towards familiarizing and keeping alive in\r\nthe minds of many of us the idea that ants habitually provide stores\r\nagainst the winter; but we must not infer from this narration that\r\nthe witty French author had ever cared to examine for himself whether\r\nthe fable, which he borrowed from Æsop, had its foundation in fact or\r\nnot. The following translation from, the Greek original[12] bears in\r\na much higher degree the impress of personal and accurate observation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: For this translation and all the foregoing extracts\r\nfrom ancient and mediæval authors I have to thank my brother, M. W.\r\nMoggridge.]\r\n\r\nΜὑρμηκες καἰ Τἑττιξ: The Ants and the Grasshopper. Once in winter\r\ntime the ants were sunning their seed-store which had been soaked\r\nby the rains. A grasshopper saw them at this, and being famished\r\nand ready to perish, he ran up and begged for a bit. To the ant's\r\nquestion, \"What were you doing in summer, idling, that you have\r\nto beg now?\" he answered, \"I lived for pleasure then, piping and\r\npleasing travellers.\" \"O, ho!\" said they, with a grin, \"dance in\r\nwinter, if you pipe in summer. Store seed for the future when you\r\ncan, and never mind playing and pleasing travellers.\"[13] It would\r\nbe easy to multiply instances in which the older authors allude to\r\nthis habit, but enough have been given to afford a sample of what\r\nmay easily be found repeated elsewhere, and I will now quote a few\r\ninstances which illustrate the more modern belief, utterly opposed to\r\nthat so long maintained by the ancients.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Æsopicæ Fabulæ (Tauchnitz edition), p. 92.]\r\n\r\nMessrs. Kirby and Spence[14] discuss the matter in the following\r\nterms:--\"When we find the writers of all nations and ages unite in\r\naffirming that, having deprived it of the power of vegetating, ants\r\nstore up grain in their nests, we feel disposed to give larger credit\r\nto their assertions. Writers in general have taken ... (this) ... for\r\ngranted. But when observers of nature began to examine the manners\r\nand economy of these creatures more narrowly, it was found, at least\r\nwith respect to the European species of ants, that no such hoards of\r\ngrain were made by them; and, in fact, that they had no magazines in\r\ntheir nests in which provisions of any kinds were stored up.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Entomology, ed. 7 (1856), p. 313.]\r\n\r\nThey then proceed to explain how easily the white pupæ, which the\r\nants carry about in their jaws, may have been mistaken for grains of\r\nwheat, and to inform us that the accurate observations of Mr. Gould,\r\npublished in 1747, were among the first which led to the correction\r\nof this error. \"However,\" they continue, \"it may be otherwise with\r\nexotic ants, for although during the cold of our winters they are\r\ngenerally torpid and need scarcely any food, yet in warmer regions,\r\nduring the rainy seasons, when they are probably confined to their\r\nnests, a store of provisions may be necessary for them.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of the article on ants in Smith's Dictionary of the Bible\r\nsays, in reference to the assertion that ants store seed, that\r\n\"observation of the habits of ants does not confirm this belief.\"\r\n\r\nLatreille[15] denies it in the following emphatic terms:\r\n\"N'attribuons pas à la fourmi une prévoyance inutile: engourdie\r\npendant l'hiver, pourquoi formeroit elle des greniers pour cette\r\nsaison?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Hist. Nat. des Fourmis, 1802.]\r\n\r\nHuber again throws the weight of his great authority into the scale\r\nagainst the ants, when he says,[16] \"I am naturally led to speak in\r\nthis place of the manner in which ants subsist in the winter, since\r\nwe have relinquished the opinion that they amass wheat and other\r\ngrain, and that they gnaw the corn to prevent it from germinating.\"\r\nHe then goes on to show how the ants are frequently torpid during the\r\nwinter, and that when it happens that a few warmer days wake them up\r\nto life, they can always find a few aphides also on the alert; for,\r\nstrange to say, the same degree of warmth which rouses the ants calls\r\nforth the aphides also. It would appear that ants in the northern\r\nparts of Europe feed on the honey-dew of aphides, and on animal\r\nmatter when they can get it; and up to the present time the belief\r\nprevails among our modern naturalists that they are limited to the\r\nsame diet in all parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Huber, on Ants, translated by J. R. Johnson, 1820.]\r\n\r\nIt is now well known, however, that exceptions must probably be made\r\nin tropical countries, for the observations of Lieut.-Col. Sykes[17]\r\nand Dr. Jerdon[18] have shown that many ants in India collect grain\r\nin large quantities, robbing the crops and plants cultivated in\r\ngardens, and even stealing seeds put away in drawers, the inference\r\nbeing that they employ them for food. The same observers have\r\nrecorded how the ants may be seen after wet weather bringing out the\r\ngrain to dry in the sun.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Lieut.-Col. Sykes, Description of New Indian Ants, in\r\nTrans. Ent. Soc. Lond., i. 103 (1836), where a single species of\r\nant, which he names _Atta providens_, is described, and its habit of\r\nharvesting recorded.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Dr. Jerdon, Madras Journal Lit. and Sc. (1851), where\r\nthree species are stated to harvest seeds on a large scale--namely,\r\n_Œcodoma (or Atta) providens_, _Œcodoma diffusa_, and _Atta rufa_,\r\nall of which belong to the same section of ants as our Mentonese\r\nharvesters, _Atta barbara_, _Atta structor_, and _Pheidole (or Atta)\r\nmegacephala_. These very interesting observations of Dr. Jerdon's, as\r\nwell as those of Lieut.-Col. Sykes, will be found in Appendix B.]\r\n\r\nDr. Lincecum has also given a very interesting account[19] of the\r\nhabits of the \"agricultural ant\" inhabiting Texas, _Myrmica (Atta)\r\nbarbata_, which not only stores the grain of a particular rice-like\r\ngrass, but is said to maintain a clean crop of this plant around its\r\nnest, suffering no weed to appear among it, and harvesting the crop\r\nin its proper season.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Published in the Journal of the Linnean Society of\r\nLondon, vol. vi. p. 29. 1861.]\r\n\r\nThe Sauba ant (_Œcodoma cephalotes_) has been seen by Mr. Bates\r\nplundering baskets containing mandioca meal (an impure form of\r\ntapioca) in Brazil, and this in so wholesale a manner as shortly to\r\nthreaten the loss of the entire supply; and Dr. Delacoux records[20]\r\nthe presence in New Granada of a monstrous ant, called by the natives\r\n_Arieros_, a word which, I am informed, is of Arabic extraction, and\r\nmeans the _carrier_, which emptied an entire sack of maize belonging\r\nto him in a single night.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Notice sur les Mœurs et les Habitudes de quelques\r\nEspèces de Formiciens des Climats Chauds. Rev. Zool., Mai, 1848, p.\r\n1849.]\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that while travellers have reported the seed-storing\r\nhabits of ants in far distant countries, our naturalists at home\r\nshould have not only remained unaware of its existence in Europe, but\r\neven strenuously denied it. It is certain, however, that naturalists\r\nand others in southern Europe are more or less aware of the fact, but\r\nI have been unable to learn that any accurate account of the habits\r\nof harvesting ants has hitherto been published, or that any one has\r\ntaken pains to discover what becomes of the seed so laboriously\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the _Enciclopedia Popolare_[21] extracts are\r\ngiven from the remarks made by M. Gené[22] on the subject, in which\r\nhe assumes that the fact that ants collect and carry to their nest\r\nlarge supplies of grain and seed is well known, but states that he is\r\nat a loss to conceive how they employ them, unless it may be that\r\nthey use them as materials for the construction of their galleries,\r\nfor they cannot eat such hard substances, all their food being\r\neither liquid or of the nature of juices, \"gli alimenti sono sempre\r\nmaterie liquide o materie sugose. Quanto ai corpi duri e secchi che\r\nle formiche raccolgono, io non so altrimenti riguardarli che come\r\nmateriali di costruzione.\" It will be understood, I think, from what\r\nhas gone before, that thus far nothing has really been ascertained as\r\nto the exact state of the case; for though the Italian author just\r\nquoted was aware that certain ants in the Mediterranean region do\r\nstore seed, his knowledge went no further. Nor am I aware that any\r\nFrench author has published an account of this habit and its object;\r\nand in a recent abundantly illustrated volume founded on a work by\r\nM. Emile Blanchard, I find, on the contrary, the following very\r\nemphatic denial of its existence:--\"The curious idea which appears\r\nto have commenced in very remote times, and to have been carried\r\ndown by tradition, and which was assisted by the results of careless\r\nobservations, concerning the habits of the ants in collecting and\r\nstoring up provisions, as it were under the influence of a wise\r\nforesight, is evidently incorrect.\"[23] There was, therefore, clearly\r\nan opening here for close observation, and this I determined to do my\r\nbest to supply.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Article Formica, vol. v. p. 143-4. (Turin, 1845).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Memorie per servire alla Storia Naturale di alcuni\r\nimenotteri, published at Modena, in 1842.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: The Transformations of Insects: an adaptation for\r\nEnglish readers of M. Emile Blanchard's Metamorphoses, Mœurs, et\r\nInstincts des Insectes, p. 196. London. 1871.]\r\n\r\nWhen I set out again from England in October, 1871, on my way to\r\nMentone, I had obtained an idea of some of the leading points which\r\nneeded to be cleared up, and I was greatly encouraged in my attempt\r\nby the interest expressed in the subject by several of our leading\r\nnaturalists, among whom I may especially mention Mr. Frederick\r\nSmith.[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: am very greatly indebted to Mr. Smith for much kind\r\nassistance, and especially for having named the specimens which I\r\ncollected.]\r\n\r\nPlainly the first thing to do was to determine whether the seeds\r\nwhich I had watched the ants carry to their nests were separately\r\nstored in subterranean granaries, as they would be if the ant really\r\nprovides for the future; or whether they were merely strewed here and\r\nthere, or used as building materials.\r\n\r\nNext I must, if possible, obtain conclusive evidence as to the use to\r\nwhich the ants put the seeds thus collected; whether they eat them\r\nor turn them to some other account. Again I must observe whether\r\nthe seed-collecting ants also search for aphides, and what other\r\nkinds of food they obtain. Then another very interesting question\r\nremained--namely, whether all southern ants uniformly collect seed,\r\nand to the same extent, or whether the habit is peculiar to certain\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThese, and many other subjects of inquiry connected with them,\r\nreadily suggested themselves to my mind, and it will now be my\r\nendeavour to show how far I have been able to throw light upon them.\r\n\r\nThe habits recorded in the following pages refer exclusively, unless\r\nspecial notice is given to the contrary, to _Atta barbara_, the\r\nblack ant represented on Plate I. We have, as far as I am aware,\r\nonly four _bonâ fide_ harvesting ants on the Riviera--namely, _Atta\r\nbarbara_ under two forms, the one wholly black the other red-headed;\r\n_Atta structor_, a creature very similar to _barbara_, but of a\r\nclaret-brown colour; and a minute yellow ant, the large workers of\r\nwhich have gigantic heads, named _Pheidole_ (or _Atta_) _megacephala_.\r\n\r\nMy renewed observations at Mentone were carried on from October,\r\n1871, to May, 1872, and I was able during that interval to become a\r\nfrequent visitor to a warm and sheltered valley, which lay but a few\r\nminutes' walk from the house in which I lived, and in which thirty\r\nnests of the most active of the seed-storing ants were to be found.\r\n\r\nFull therefore of my intention to resolve this difficulty if\r\npossible, I set out on October 29, 1871, immediately after my return\r\nto Mentone, to revisit this valley, where, in the previous May, I had\r\nseen the ants busily engaged in cutting, carrying, and sorting their\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\nThe spot in question was a rough slope of soft sandstone rock, with\r\naccumulations of sandy soil in the hollows, covered with a sparse and\r\nscrubby vegetation, composed of _Cistus_ (_C. salvifolius_), pot-herb\r\nthyme, black lavender (_Lavandula stæchas_), spiny broom (_Calycotome\r\nspinosa_), overshadowed here and there by a few scattered stone and\r\nmaritime pines, and intermixed with coarse grasses and some smaller\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nCultivated lemon terraces lay on the edge of the wild ground lower\r\ndown in the valley, and at this season, as also in the late spring,\r\nthese terraces were overgrown with a rank crop of weeds, most of\r\nwhich were in seed.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely set foot on the _garrigue_, as this kind of wild\r\nground is called, to distinguish it from meadows or terraced land,\r\nbefore I was met by a long train of ants, forming two continuous\r\nlines, hurrying in opposite directions, the one with their mouths\r\nfull, the others with their mouths empty.\r\n\r\nIt was easy enough to find the nest to which these ants belonged, for\r\nit was only necessary to follow the line of ants burdened with seeds,\r\ngrain, or entire capsules, which had their heads turned homewards,\r\nand there, sure enough, at about ten yards distance, and partly\r\nshaded by some small _Cistus_ bushes, lay the nest, to and from the\r\nentrances of which the incessant stream of incomers and outgoers kept\r\nflowing.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the ants were the same as those previously\r\nobserved in the late spring (April and May), the workers usually\r\nseeking their harvest at some distance from the nest, and going in\r\nsearch of it as far as the cultivated ground, where the crops of\r\nweeds were more abundant and more varied.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases, however, where the terraces were too far distant,\r\nthey contented themselves with plundering the grasses, pea-flowers,\r\nhoneywort, and the other denizens of the garrigue. In one case I was\r\nable to follow the thread-like column of workers from the nest to the\r\nweedy terrace where the plants grew from which they were gathering\r\nthe seeds, and found that the nearly continuous double line measured\r\ntwenty-four yards. Even this gives but an inadequate idea of the\r\nnumber of ants actively employed in the service of this colony, for\r\nhundreds of them were dispersed among the weeds on the terrace, and\r\nmany were also employed in sorting the materials and in attending to\r\nthe internal economy of the nest. Still this affords some evidence\r\nof the systematic and extensive scale on which foraging is carried on\r\nby this ant, and of the high importance which these creatures attach\r\nto their provision of grain.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little surprising to see that the ants bring in not\r\nonly seeds of large size and fallen grain, but also green capsules,\r\nthe torn stalks of which show that they have been freshly gathered\r\nfrom the plant. The manner in which they accomplish this feat\r\nis as follows. An ant ascends the stem of a fruiting plant, of\r\nShepherd's-purse (_Capsella Bursa pastoris_) let us say, and\r\nselects a well-filled but green pod about midway up the stem, those\r\nbelow being ready to shed their seeds at a touch. Then, seizing\r\nit in its jaws, and fixing its hind legs firmly as a pivot, it\r\ncontrives to turn round and round, and so strain the fibres of the\r\nfruit-stalk that at length they snap. It then descends the stem,\r\npatiently backing and turning upwards again as often as the clumsy\r\nand disproportionate burden becomes wedged between the thickly set\r\nstalks, and joins the line of its companions on their way to the\r\nnest. In this manner capsules of chickweed (_Alsine media_) and\r\nentire calyces, containing the nutlets of Calaminth, are gathered;\r\ntwo ants also sometimes combine their efforts, when one stations\r\nitself near the base of the peduncle and gnaws it at the point of\r\ngreatest tension, while the other hauls upon and twists it. I have\r\nnever seen a capsule severed from its stalk by cutting alone, and\r\nthe mandibles of this ant are perhaps incompetent to perform such a\r\ntask. I have occasionally seen ants engaged in cutting the capsules\r\nof certain plants drop them and allow their companions below to carry\r\nthem away; and this corresponds with the curious account given by\r\nÆlian[25] of the manner in which the spikelets of corn are severed\r\nand thrown down \"to the people below,\" [Greek: tô dêmô tô katô] τω\r\nδἡμω κἁτω.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Vide supra, p. 8.]\r\n\r\nIf the incoming and weight-carrying column of ants be closely\r\nexamined it will be found that though the great majority of workers\r\nare bringing seeds in some form to the nest, a few are burdened with\r\nother and more miscellaneous materials.\r\n\r\nOccasionally one or two may be detected carrying a dead insect, or\r\ncrushed land-shell, the corolla of a flower, a fragment of stick, or\r\nleaf, but I have never seen aphides brought in to the nest or visited\r\nby this ant or by _Atta structor_.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that an ant has manifestly made a bad selection,\r\nand is told on its return that what it has brought home with much\r\npains is no better than rubbish, and is hustled out of the nest,\r\nand forced to throw its burden away. In order to try whether these\r\ncreatures were not fallible like other mortals, I one day took out\r\nwith me a little packet of grey and white porcelain beads, and\r\nscattered these in the path of a harvesting train. They had scarcely\r\nlain a minute on the earth before one of the largest workers seized\r\nupon a bead, and with some difficulty clipped it with its mandibles\r\nand trotted back at a great pace to the nest. I waited for a little\r\nwhile, my attention being divided between the other ants who were\r\nvainly endeavouring to remove the beads, and the entrance down which\r\nthe worker had disappeared, and then left the spot. On my return\r\nin an hour's time, I found the ants passing unconcernedly by and\r\nover the beads which lay where I had strewn them in apparently\r\nundiminished quantities; and I conclude from this that they had\r\nfound out their mistake, and had wisely returned to their accustomed\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nI have often amused myself by strewing hemp and canary seed or oats,\r\nall of which form heavy burdens for the ants, near their nests;\r\nand it is a curious sight to watch the eagerness and determination\r\nwith which they will drag them away. It is interesting also to note\r\nhow on the following day the husks of these seeds will appear on\r\nthe rubbish-heap, or sometimes, after a shower of rain, they will\r\nbe brought out by the ants with the point of the little root (the\r\nradicle or fibril as the case may be) gnawed off (see Figs. A, B, C,\r\nPlate VI., p. 35).\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens that on the wild hillside the position of a\r\nnest of _Atta barbara_ is indicated by the presence of a number\r\nof plants growing on or round the kitchen midden, which are\r\nproperly weeds of cultivation, and strangers to the cistus- and\r\nlavender-covered banks of the garrigue. These have sprung from\r\nseeds accidentally dropped by the ants, and which they had obtained\r\nfrom the lemon terraces. Thus when you see little patches of ground\r\nfrom one to three feet long and broad, covered with such plants as\r\nfumitory (_Fumaria_), oats (_Avena_), nettles (_Urtica membranacea_),\r\nfour species of _Veronica_, chickweed (_Alsine media_), goosefoot\r\n(_Chenopodium_), _Rumex Bucephalephorus_, wild marigold (_Calendula\r\narvensis_), _Antirrhinum Orontium_, _Linaria simplex_, and _Cardamine\r\nhirsuta_, you may confidently expect to find a colony of these ants\r\nclose at hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate I._]\r\n\r\nThese plants are sometimes found along the sides of miniature\r\ngullies and crevices in the rock, where they have been washed by\r\nlittle runlets of water formed in seasons of heavy rain, and thus\r\nthese interloping plants are occasionally dispersed and brought into\r\ncompetition with the rightful occupiers of the ground.\r\n\r\n_Atta structor_ and _A. barbara_ do not employ any materials in the\r\nconstruction of their nest, simply excavating it out of the earth\r\nitself, or occasionally out of the sandy rock, and the large mounds,\r\nin great part composed of vegetable matter, which may frequently\r\nbe found at the entrances of their nests, are nothing more than\r\nthe rubbish heaps and kitchen middens of each establishment. These\r\nconsist in part of the earth pellets and grains of gravel which\r\nthe ants bring out from their nest when forming the subterranean\r\ngalleries, but principally of plant-refuse such as the chaff of\r\ngrasses, empty capsules, gnawed seed-coats, and the like, which\r\nwould occupy much space if left inside the nest (see Plate I., Fig.\r\nA.). While an army of workers are employed in seeking and bringing\r\nin supplies, others are busy sorting the materials thus obtained,\r\nstripping off all the useless envelopes of seed or grain, and\r\ncarrying them out to throw away. Thanks to the unwearied activity\r\nwith which this divided labour is carried on the kitchen middens\r\nspeedily rise in the harvest season, and in places where they are not\r\nexposed to the action of wind and rain, often acquire a considerable\r\nsize, so much so that sometimes, if collected, one alone might fill a\r\nquart tankard.\r\n\r\nIt was the sight of such a refuse mound, and an examination of the\r\nmaterials which composed it,--many of which show that they were\r\nonce parts of seeds, &c., the albuminous contents of which had\r\nbeen extracted through holes gnawed in the side,--that gave me the\r\nconviction that large stores of seed must lie hidden below in the\r\nnest; for if it were true, as some have suggested, that the ants\r\nemploy the grain and seeds which they collect as materials for the\r\nconstruction of their nest, they would certainly not reject such\r\nparts as the chaff of grasses and the like, which are admirably\r\nsuited for the purpose, and are actually used for this end by other\r\nspecies of ants.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore with the greatest confidence as to the result that I\r\nopened the nests of _Atta barbara_ in search of granaries and seeds.\r\nMy first attempt was made upon a nest lying in a hollow where there\r\nwas a rather deep bed of soil, and the galleries extended so far on\r\neither side and in a downward direction that, though I removed enough\r\nsoil to fill a wheelbarrow, I failed to reach the arcana of the nest,\r\nand saw neither chambers nor granaries.\r\n\r\nYet I frequently encountered workers carrying seeds downwards along\r\nthe subterranean passages. I then selected a nest where the coarse\r\nand hard rock lay much nearer to the surface, barring their downward\r\ncourse, and compelling the ants to extend their nest in a horizontal\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nHere, almost at the first stroke, I came upon large masses of seeds\r\ncarefully stored in chambers prepared in the soil. Some of these\r\nlay in long subcylindrical galleries, and, owing to the presence in\r\nlarge quantities of the black shining seeds of amaranth (_Amaranthus\r\nBlitum_, &c.), looked like trains of gunpowder laid ready for\r\nblasting. Fig. A, Plate II. represents a trowelful of earth taken\r\nfrom this nest, and lifted with care so as to leave the seeds almost\r\n_in situ_. Others were massed together in horizontal chambers, having\r\na concave roof and a flat and carefully prepared floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate II._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate III._]\r\n\r\nThe texture of the floor usually differs markedly from that of the\r\nsurrounding soil, and the fine grains of silex and mica which are\r\nselected for its construction are more or less cemented together, so\r\nthat the floor will sometimes part, when dry, from the soil about it,\r\nas caked and dry mud separates from a gravel path (see Plate III.).\r\n\r\nOn carefully examining a quantity of the seeds, grain, and minute\r\ndry fruits taken from the granaries, I found that they had been\r\ngathered from the following plants: fumitory (_Fumaria Capreolata_,\r\n&c.), amaranth (_Amaranthus Blitum_, &c.), _Setaria_, and three other\r\nspecies of grasses, honeywort (_Alyssum maritimum_), _Veronica_, and\r\nfrom four unrecognised species, one of which was a pea-flower. There\r\nwere therefore in this nest seeds, &c., which had been taken from\r\nmore than twelve distinct species of plants, belonging to at least\r\nseven separate families. The granaries lay from an inch and a half to\r\nsix inches below the surface and were all horizontal. They were of\r\nvarious sizes and shapes, the average granary being about as large as\r\na gentleman's gold watch.\r\n\r\nI was greatly surprised to find that the seeds, though quite moist,\r\nshowed no trace of germination, and this was the more astonishing as\r\nthe self-sown seeds of the same kinds as those detected here, such\r\nas fumitory for instance, were then coming up abundantly in gardens\r\nand on terraces. The seeds of _Odontites lutea_ afford a curious test\r\nof the presence of moisture in the granaries, and it will usually\r\nbe found that, when they are recently taken out of the nest, they\r\nare of a greenish colour and semi-transparent horn-like texture,\r\nwhich changes on exposure to the air to a chalky white and opaque\r\nappearance, due to the drying of the coat of the seed.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the sound condition of the seeds in these granaries\r\nseemed to me so very strange and difficult to explain that I\r\ndetermined to pay special attention to the subject, and with this\r\nview collected and carefully examined large quantities of the grain\r\nand seeds taken at different times from the stores of twenty-one\r\ndistinct nests, the first of which was opened on October 29th, and\r\nthe last on May 5th. In these twenty-one nests out of the thousands\r\nof seeds taken I only found twenty-seven in seven nests which showed\r\ntrace of germination, and of these eleven had been mutilated in such\r\na way as to arrest their growth. The sprouting seeds were found in\r\nthe months from November to February, while in the nests opened in\r\nOctober, March, April, and May, no sprouted seeds were discovered,\r\nthough these latter months are certainly highly favourable to\r\ngermination. It is therefore extremely rare to find other than sound\r\nand intact seeds in the granaries, and we must conclude that the ants\r\nexercise some mysterious power over them which checks the tendency to\r\ngerminate.\r\n\r\nApparently it is not that moisture or warmth or the influence of\r\natmospheric air is denied to the seeds, for we find them in damp\r\nsoil, in genial weather, and often at but a trifling distance below\r\nthe surface of the ground; and I have proved that the vitality of\r\nthe seeds is not affected by raising crops of young plants, such as\r\nfumitory, pellitory, _Polygonum aviculare_, and grasses, from seeds\r\ntaken out of granaries.[26]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: This experiment was tried by me on two occasions,\r\nin the former case the seeds were taken from a granary about four\r\ninches below the surface of the ground, on November 10th, and sowed\r\ntwo days afterwards, and several of these were up on Dec. 1st. The\r\nsecond trial was made on seeds found at only one and a half inch\r\nbelow the surface, on Dec. 29th, 1871; these were sowed in England on\r\nJune 18th, 1872, and the young plants made their appearance in large\r\nnumbers ten days afterwards.]\r\n\r\nI have frequently remarked that it is the seeds last collected before\r\na fall of rain which are brought out in a sprouting condition from\r\nthe nest; for I have observed in cases where I had recently scattered\r\nseeds near wild nests, that it is these which are carried out from\r\nthe nest and placed to dry after a wet night; and so in the case of a\r\nnest which I kept in captivity, when a variety of different seeds had\r\nbeen successively supplied to the ants, it was the cabbage, lettuce,\r\nand chicory seeds, given the day before the nest was watered, that\r\nreappeared after having been carried below, and not the hemp, canary,\r\nand mixed seeds of wild plants previously strewed on the nest. It\r\nseems possible that the process, whatever it may be, to which the\r\nants subject the seeds which are to remain dormant may require some\r\ntime, and the construction of the granary chambers is doubtless a\r\nlong affair, so that when unusually large supplies of grain, &c.,\r\nare brought in by the workers some part of them may not find the\r\nnecessary accommodation and attention. When the seeds do germinate\r\nin the nests, and it is my belief that they are usually softened\r\nand made to sprout before they are consumed by the ants, it is very\r\ncurious to see how the growth is checked in its earliest stage,\r\nand how, after the radicle or fibril--the first growing root of\r\ndicotyledonous and monocotyledonous seeds--has been gnawed off, they\r\nare brought out from the nest and placed in the sun to dry, and then,\r\nafter a sufficient exposure, carried below into the nest.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are thus in effect malted, the starch being changed into\r\nsugar, and I have myself witnessed the avidity with which the\r\ncontents of seeds thus treated are devoured by the ants.\r\n\r\nFigs. A, B, C, in Plate VI., p. 35, illustrate the manner in which\r\nthe ants mutilate the germinating seeds and check their growth.\r\nThus, at Fig. C 2 of Plate VI. a sprouting but uninjured canary seed\r\n(_Phalaris canariensis_) is drawn, magnified, and at Figs. C and C\r\n1 the same of the natural size and magnified, after the ants have\r\ngnawed its fibril (fib.), which in this case pierces the undeveloped\r\nradicle (rad.). Fig. A 2 represents a sprouting hemp-seed,\r\nmagnified,[27] and Figs. A, A 1, the same of the natural size and\r\nmagnified, mutilated, the tip of the radicle being removed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Properly a nut, for it comprises the seed and the\r\nenveloping coat of the ovary. The canary seed also, spoken of above,\r\nis a grain containing a seed.]\r\n\r\nAt Figs. B, B 1, B 2, the same process is shown in the case of a\r\nsmall wild pea.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, certain that though a few individual seeds may sprout\r\nin the nests from time to time either with or without the concurrence\r\nof the ants, the great mass remain for many weeks, or even months,\r\nquite intact, neither decaying nor germinating, whereas every one\r\nknows that if a quantity of seeds are placed in the soil in a moist\r\nand warm place, all the seeds that are of one kind will almost\r\nsimultaneously begin to grow after the lapse of a fixed interval.\r\n\r\nNow if this took place in an ant's nest, the provisions would\r\nhave to be rapidly consumed at stated periods and to be frequently\r\nrenewed; but this is not the case. This is easily shown by an\r\nexamination of the seeds contained in the nests in April or May, many\r\nof which will prove to belong to plants which fruit in the autumn and\r\nare not to be found later than November. Thus, for example, on May\r\n5th at Cannes, I discovered nutlets of _Cynoglossum pictum_, which\r\ncan scarcely have been collected later than the preceding October\r\nor November. Besides, during the time from the middle of January to\r\nthe middle of March, scarcely a seed is collected under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, there being extremely few wild plants in fruit at that\r\nseason, and yet the granaries will be found well filled if a nest is\r\nopened at the end of this period.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the fact that ants in warm climates accumulate large\r\nand very varied stores of seeds retaining their power of germination,\r\nmight at times be of service to travellers, by enabling them to\r\nobtain, by a stroke or two of the spade, an interesting collection\r\nof the seeds and the seed-like fruits of the country, when time\r\nand opportunity failed for obtaining them in a more satisfactory\r\nmanner. The following list of plants, the grain, seeds, and small dry\r\nfruits of which I have found in the subterranean granaries of _Atta\r\nstructor_ and _A. barbara_, especially the latter, shows that the\r\nants probably collect almost indiscriminately from any fruiting plant\r\nthat falls in their way.\r\n\r\nFumitory (_Fumaria_, three species), honeywort (_Alyssum maritimum_),\r\nnarrow-leaved sun rose (_Fumaria viscida_ and _F. Spachii_),\r\n_Oxalis corniculata_, _Silene_, _Linum gallicum_, mallow (_Lavatera\r\ncretica_?), medick (_Medicago_), wild lentil (_Ervum_), spiny\r\nbroom (_Cytisus spinosus_), _Valerianella carinata_, _Centaurea\r\naspera_, _Odontites lutea_, _Calamintha Nepeta_, _Polygonum\r\nconvolvulus_ and _P. aviculare_, amaranth (_Amaranthus Blitum_ and\r\n_patulus_), pellitory (_Parietaria_), _Euphorbia_, pine (_Pinus_),\r\nwild sarsaparilla (_Smilax aspera_), _Setaria verticillata_ and\r\n_S. italica_, _Andropogon Ischæmum_, and of eight other plants of\r\nwhich I do not recognise the seeds. This list, comprising plants\r\nbelonging to eighteen distinct families, might be greatly prolonged\r\nif I were to add to it the names of the seeds which I have seen the\r\nants carry towards their nests, but have not actually detected in\r\nthe granaries. Thus I have seen trains of ants burdened with the\r\nlong-beaked, spirally-twisted fruits of crane's bill (_Erodium_),\r\nand, as above mentioned, with capsules of chickweed (_Alsine media_)\r\nand shepherd's-purse (_Capsella Bursa pastoris_), with whole orange\r\npips, and even haricot beans, seeds of the New Zealand veronica\r\n(_V. Andersonii_), of _Silene pseudoatocion_, and many other garden\r\nplants, also with nutlets of the plane tree and seeds of the cypress.\r\n\r\nPliny mentions[28] incidentally having watched the ants carrying away\r\ncypress seeds, and comments upon the fact that so small a creature\r\nshould be able to interfere with the growth of such a noble tree.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Pliny, Nat. Hist., xvii. 14, 3.]\r\n\r\nI have little doubt that the seed stores of the ants in botanic and\r\nother gardens, where rare plants are cultivated in southern Europe\r\nand in warm climates generally, contain samples taken from the fruits\r\nof a great many of the rarer and more interesting species as well as\r\nof the weeds and native plants. Indeed I have been told that this is\r\nthe case by my friend Dr. Bornet, who complains of the depredations\r\ncommitted by the ants in the gardens of the Villa Thuret, at Antibes.\r\nThey go so far as to plunder the seed bags which are hung from the\r\nbranches of the trees and shrubs, unless these are securely closed\r\nand tied with string; they carry off wholesale the grass and anemone\r\nseeds,[29] which are scattered when the lawns are resown; and Dr.\r\nBornet has seen the seeds of _Acacia retinoides_ lie heaped up by the\r\nhandful at the entrances of their nests, and disappear below after a\r\nfew hours.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Properly grass grain and anemone achenes.]\r\n\r\nM. Germain de St. Pierre has observed similar facts at Hyères, where\r\nhe has detected large stores of cereals in the granaries of the ants,\r\nand considers that the robberies committed by these creatures are\r\nsufficient in extent to cause a serious loss to cultivators.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the amount of seed stored in a single\r\nnest by a colony of ants both on account of the extent of these\r\nnests, and because of the number of seeds which are always lost in\r\ndigging. The nests themselves also vary greatly in size. Perhaps I\r\nshall not be very far from the mark however, if I conjecture that\r\naverage-sized nests contain during the winter months about half a\r\npint of seeds.\r\n\r\n_Atta structor_ is more frequently found near houses and in gardens\r\nthan _A. barbara_, the latter usually living on wild ground adjoining\r\ncultivation. There was a flourishing colony of _structor_ in the main\r\nstreet of Mentone, cleverly placed at the lintel of the door of a\r\ncorn chandler's store, where they were ever on the look out for stray\r\ngrains of oats and wheat, which might chance to fall from the sacks.\r\nAnother nest, in a different part of the town, got its principal\r\nsubsistence from the grains of canary seed, which were scattered by\r\nthe birds occupying a cage hanging outside a shop window at a little\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vertical section of an ant's nest. The horizontal\r\nlines represent inches of depth.]\r\n\r\nThe granaries of _A. structor_ are arranged in the same way as those\r\nof _A. barbara_, and may, in like manner, be found stored with seeds,\r\nand lying at depths below the surface, varying from one to twenty\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate IV.]\r\n\r\nA diagram is given in the preceding woodcut of a vertical section of\r\na nest of _barbara_ lying in soil sixteen inches deep, the granaries\r\nbeing at 1-1/2, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12-1/2 inches, as determined by\r\nactual measurement on the spot.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, and especially where the soil is shallow, the\r\ngalleries and granaries are much crowded together, as is shown in\r\nPlate IV., which represents a small mass of earth, pierced by the\r\nroots of plants, taken out of a nest of _barbara_, lying at two\r\ninches below the surface. When first opened all these granaries were\r\nfilled with seeds.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the granary chambers varies considerably, as may be\r\nseen by reference to the drawing of three floors given in Plate\r\nIII., p. 23, and that shown diagrammatically in the woodcut on next\r\npage, where the white space represents the granary floor, and the\r\ndark circular spot in the centre, the aperture of a gallery leading\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\nI once had an opportunity of seeing a large portion of a nest of\r\nthe red-headed variety of _barbara_ laid bare by a cutting recently\r\nmade through a bank at Cannes in digging the foundations of a house,\r\nwhich exposed a very extensive and complicated series of galleries\r\nand granaries. The lowest point at which I detected the workings of\r\nthe ants was at twenty inches below the surface of the ground, and\r\nhere granaries containing seeds in abundance were present, and the\r\ngalleries and granaries extended over a space measuring 5ft. 9in.\r\nin a horizontal direction. In two cases I have found nests of _Atta\r\nbarbara_ at Mentone which were carried far into the living rock\r\nin places where it happened to be of an even grain, and not gritty\r\nor pebbly as it frequently is. It was quite by chance that I first\r\ndiscovered this very interesting fact, having tracked a train of\r\nseed-bearing workers to a part of the sandstone rock where steps had\r\nquite recently been hacked out leading to some terraces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate V._]\r\n\r\nI soon saw that the ants entered and came out from three or four\r\nsmall passages in the cleft surface of the rock, and that their nest\r\nactually lay in the sandstone itself. Having contrived to wedge off\r\nseveral large flakes of the rock, which was soft in most places and\r\nmight be scooped out with a strong knife, I discovered that though\r\nsome of the passages of the ants followed the lines of cleavage and\r\nthe cracks made by the fine wiry fibres of the bushes growing on the\r\nsurface, others were frequently made in the form of tubular tunnels\r\nthrough the living rock. Without the aid of hammer and chisel it was\r\nnot possible to follow the galleries and to secure specimens of the\r\nmined rock; but on the next day (Dec. 7th) I returned armed with\r\ntools, and with the assistance of a friend[30] quarried out a portion\r\nof the nest, tracing it down eventually to twenty-three inches below\r\nthe surface of the rock in a vertical, and to about sixteen inches\r\naway from the surface in a horizontal direction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to Mr.\r\nRobert Lightbody for help on this and other occasions.]\r\n\r\nAt one point where the rock was almost entirely solid and without\r\nflaw or crevice, and where it was clear that the passages were\r\nentirely the work of the ants, we measured a tunnel by worming\r\na straw down it, and found it to be ten inches in length. We\r\nsubsequently traced this tunnel or rock gallery down until it\r\ncommunicated with a chamber filled with winged ants and seeds of\r\nseveral kinds. This granary was horizontal, and merely an enlargement\r\nof an ordinary gallery of a compressed spindle-shape, flattened from\r\nabove downwards, measuring as nearly as I could estimate three inches\r\nin length, by a trifle less than an inch in breadth, and half an\r\ninch in height. The walls were tolerably smooth, but not prepared or\r\nglazed in the way that certain small terminal cells which I shall\r\nshortly describe were. The surfaces, however, had a very different\r\nappearance to that of the surrounding sandstone, being of a darker\r\nand brownish colour, and seeming to be coated with some kind of\r\ndressing or cement.\r\n\r\nOne of these tunnels at first took a horizontal course for two and a\r\nhalf inches, then descended vertically for an inch and a half to a\r\npoint where it made two horizontal branches, and from these latter\r\nseveral other vertical galleries descended, two of which we were able\r\nto trace until they expanded into a cluster of small pear-shaped\r\ncells, the walls of which were quite smooth and very carefully laid\r\nwith plates of mica and cement. I was able to draw this on the spot,\r\nFig. A, Plate V., while Mr. Lightbody worked it out piecemeal with\r\nhammer and chisel. It was unfortunately impossible to secure more\r\nthan very imperfect fragments as specimens. These terminal cells\r\nwere empty when we came to them, but it is quite possible that the\r\nants may have conveyed away larvæ or winged ants from them, having\r\nreceived abundant notice of the coming danger from the continued\r\njarring of the chisel-work.\r\n\r\nOne entrance to this nest lay in a small accumulation of soil in a\r\nhollow of the rock, and it was at this point that the refuse from\r\nthe nest was cast out. Indeed, had it not been for the accidental\r\ncircumstance of my having traced the ants to the newly hewn step in\r\nthe sandstone, I might never have discovered the fact that the nests\r\nare sometimes carried deep into the living rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate VI._]\r\n\r\nWith this to guide me, however, I succeeded in finding a second nest\r\nof the same kind, and here I was able to secure better specimens\r\nof the tunnels for drawing (Figs. B, B 1, Plate V., p. 33). These\r\ndrawings may be taken as representing also the size and shape of the\r\ntunnels in the former nest, which were for the most part like these,\r\nbeautifully cylindrical, as is shown in the front view of the tunnel\r\nat B 1. In one nest of _barbara_ I found a curious hollow spherical\r\ndome, about an inch in diameter, the walls of which were constructed\r\nof hardened earth about two lines thick, and having a large circular\r\naperture at the top and a very small one below (Figs. D and D 1,\r\nPlate VI.). This dome was imbedded below in earth which adhered to\r\nit, but it was otherwise easily separable from the soil; its inner\r\nwalls were smoothed with great nicety.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested to me that this spherical chamber was\r\noriginally the work of a scarabæus, which had chanced to bury the\r\nball containing its eggs close to the nest of the ants, and that\r\nthe latter had appropriated it after the departure of the beetle\r\ngrubs. This may perhaps have been the case, but the dome was rather\r\nlarger than the ball usually formed by the scarab beetle, and I have\r\nnever seen one of these balls surrounded by a hardened case. The\r\nchamber thus constructed was employed as a granary, and filled, as\r\nwell as the adjacent passages, with the grain of a grass (_Tragus\r\nracemosus_), still enclosed in the husks, among which I detected\r\nseveral ants at work, and also some minute white semi-transparent\r\ncreatures, like spring-tails (_Podurus_), which abound in these ants'\r\nnests. Besides this spring-tail it is common to find in the galleries\r\nand granaries of _Atta structor_ and _A. barbara_, certain silky\r\nyellowish-white \"silver fish\" (_Lepisma_), a small white woodlouse\r\nwhich does not roll itself into a ball, and at times the larvæ of an\r\nelater beetle. I have observed on more than one occasion that when\r\nin digging into an ant's nest I have thrown out an elater larva,\r\nthe ants would cluster round it and direct it towards some small\r\nopening in the soil, which it would quickly enlarge and disappear\r\ndown. At other times, however, the ants would take no notice of\r\nthe elater, and it is my belief that the attentions paid to it on\r\nformer occasions were purely selfish, and that they intended to avail\r\nthemselves of the tunnel thus made down into the soil, with a view of\r\nreopening communications with the galleries and granaries concealed\r\nbelow, the approaches to which had been covered up. I have frequently\r\nwatched the ants make use of these passages mined by the elater on\r\nthese occasions.\r\n\r\nAt one time I suspected that the elater larvæ might consume the\r\nseeds stored by the ants, and I therefore confined some of them in a\r\ntumblerful of earth and seeds; but at the end of three weeks, though\r\nthe larvæ were strong and healthy-looking, I could not detect that\r\nany of the seeds had been touched, and even those which had sprouted\r\nremained uninjured. I have searched in vain for the beetles and\r\nstaphylinidæ which are known to inhabit certain ant's nests. In one\r\nnest I found (on Dec. 28) a quantity of small spherical, egg-like\r\ngalls, slightly larger than but resembling the fruit of _Fumaria\r\ncapreolata_, spotted with pink-brown on a yellowish or greyish\r\nground. There was a dark spot at the point at which the mature insect\r\nwould emerge, and one did escape from the egg-like cocoon while I\r\nwas watching, and proved to be a _Cynips_ of very small size, but\r\nfurnished with a terrible dart for puncturing its prey.\r\n\r\nIt seems difficult to understand how it comes that these galls are\r\nsystematically placed among the seeds, for it was evidently no chance\r\noccurrence, and I can only conjecture that the worker ants may have\r\nbrought them in and stored them under the impression that they were\r\nreally seeds! Even ants make mistakes, and of this I have given\r\nan example above (p. 19). Though I have frequently found colonies\r\nof several distinct species of ants inhabiting nests made in the\r\nearth traversed by the widespread galleries of _Atta structor_ and\r\n_barbara_, I have never detected any intermixture of species in the\r\nchambers of a nest,[31] and but rarely found even the galleries and\r\nentrance used in common by more than one species. On one occasion\r\nwhen opening a nest of _structor_ I cut through a colony of the tiny,\r\nlarge-headed, yellow ant _Pheidole megacephala_, lying in the midst\r\nof, though distinct from, the former. When, however, it chanced that\r\none of the _structors_ fell from the crumbling earth into the midst\r\nof the _Pheidoles_, it was curious to see how fiercely it would\r\nbe attacked, and with what terrified speed it would scamper off,\r\nwithout attempting any resistance, and often carrying two or three\r\n_Pheidoles_ hanging on to its legs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Except in a few cases where I have seen one or two\r\n_structors_ in nests of _barbara_ and _vice versâ_, and in the\r\ncurious instance to be mentioned below, where one colony consisted\r\nof nearly equal parts of _structor_, _barbara_, and the red-headed\r\nvariety of _barbara_.]\r\n\r\nAccidentally in this way battles do sometimes take place between\r\nants of different species; but by far the most savage and prolonged\r\ncontests which I have witnessed were those in which the combatants\r\nbelong to two different colonies of the same species.\r\n\r\n_Atta barbara_, _Formica cruentata_, _F. erratica_, and especially\r\n_Myrmica cæspitum_ may sometimes be seen fighting in this desperate\r\nfashion. Rival colonies of _Myrmica cæspitum_ often gather for the\r\nbattle into dense masses three or four inches deep, and the place of\r\nconflict will be seen on the following day strewn with the dead, and\r\nthis though the majority of the slain are carried off for food by the\r\nvictors.\r\n\r\nBut the most singular contests are those which are waged for seeds\r\nby _A. barbara_, when one colony plunders the stores of an adjacent\r\nnest belonging to the same species, the weaker nest making prolonged\r\nthough, for the most part, inefficient attempts to recover their\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the other species of ant which I have watched\r\nfighting, the strife would last but a short time--a few hours or a\r\nday--but _A. barbara_ will carry on the battle day after day and week\r\nafter week. I was able to devote a good deal of time to watching\r\nthe progress of a predatory war of this kind, waged by one nest of\r\n_barbara_ against another, and which lasted for forty-six days, from\r\nJan. 18 to March 4!\r\n\r\nI cannot of course declare positively that no cessation of\r\nhostilities may have taken place during the time, but I can affirm\r\nthat whenever I visited the spot, and I did so on twelve days, or\r\nas nearly as possible, twice a week, the scene was one of war and\r\nspoliation such as that which I shall now describe.\r\n\r\nAn active train of ants, nearly resembling an ordinary harvesting\r\ntrain, led from the entrance of one nest to that of another lower\r\ndown the slope, and fifteen feet distant; but on closer examination\r\nit appeared that though the great mass of seed-bearers were\r\ntravelling towards the upper nest, some few were going in the\r\nopposite direction and making for the lower. Besides this, at\r\nintervals, combats might be seen taking place, one ant seizing the\r\nfree end of a seed carried by another, and endeavouring to wrench it\r\naway, and then frequently, as neither would let go, the stronger ant\r\nwould drag seed and opponent towards its nest. At times other ants\r\nwould interfere and seize one of the combatants and endeavour to drag\r\nit away, this often resulting in terrible mutilations, and especially\r\nin the loss of the abdomen, which would be torn off while the jaws\r\nof the victim retained their indomitable bull-dog grip upon the\r\nseed. Then the victor might be seen dragging away his prize, while\r\nits adversary, though now little more than a head and legs, offered\r\na vigorous though of course ineffectual resistance. I frequently\r\nobserved that the ants during these conflicts would endeavour to\r\nseize one another's antennæ, and that if this were effected, the ant\r\nthus assaulted would instantly release his hold, whether of seed or\r\nadversary, and appear utterly discomfited. No doubt the antennæ are\r\ntheir most sensitive parts, and injuries inflicted on these organs\r\ncause the greatest pain.\r\n\r\nIt was not until I had watched this scene for some days that I\r\napprehended its true meaning, and discovered that the ants of the\r\nupper nest were robbing the granaries of the lower, while the latter\r\ntried to recover the stolen seeds both by fighting for them and by\r\nstealing seeds in their turn from the nest of their oppressors.\r\nThe thieves, however, were evidently the stronger, and streams of\r\nants laden with seeds arrived safely at the upper nest, while close\r\nobservation showed that very few seeds were successfully carried on\r\nthe reverse journey into the lower and plundered nest.\r\n\r\nThus when I fixed my attention on one of these robbed ants\r\nsurreptitiously making its exit with the seed from the thieves' nest,\r\nand having overcome the opposition and dangers met with on its way,\r\nreaching after a journey which took six minutes to accomplish, the\r\nentrance to its own home, I saw that it was violently deprived of its\r\nburden by a guard of ants stationed there apparently for the purpose,\r\none of whom instantly started off and carried the seed all the way\r\nback again to the upper nest.\r\n\r\nThis I saw repeated several times.\r\n\r\nAfter March 4 I never saw any acts of hostility between these nests,\r\nthough the robbed nest was not abandoned. In another case of the\r\nsame kind, however, where the struggle lasted thirty-one days, the\r\nrobbed nest was at length completely abandoned, and on opening it I\r\nfound all the granaries empty with one single exception, and this\r\none was pierced by the matted roots of grasses and other plants,\r\nand must therefore have been long neglected by the ants. Strangely\r\nenough, not one of the seeds in this deserted granary showed traces\r\nof germination.\r\n\r\nNo doubt some very pressing need is the cause of these systematic\r\nraids in search of accumulations of seeds, and there can be little\r\ndoubt that the requirements of distinct colonies of ants of the same\r\nspecies are often different even at the same season and date. Thus\r\nthese warring colonies of ants were active on many days when the\r\nmajority of the nests were completely closed; and I have even seen\r\nthese robbers staggering along, enfeebled by the cold, and in wind\r\nand rain, when all other ants were safe below ground. It may be that\r\nunusual exertions are necessitated by some exceptional demands made\r\nby the condition of the larvæ of the winged male and female ants, and\r\nI have observed that these latter appear at very various periods.\r\nThus I have seen winged males and females in the nests of _barbara_\r\non November 10, December 6, February 2, and March 10; and in those of\r\n_structor_ on February 23, 29, March 13, and April 6.\r\n\r\nThough _structor_ and _barbara_ make seed collecting the business\r\nof their lives, they will, at least in times of scarcity, eagerly\r\ndevour animal food if it happen to fall in their way, and in the\r\nharvesting trains a few ants may occasionally be seen carrying small\r\ndead insects and the like. Once I threw a dead grasshopper down close\r\nto a nest of _barbara_; it was immediately seized upon, and--after\r\nstrenuous efforts had been made to dismember it above ground, some\r\nants straining back the legs and wings, while others rushed in to\r\ngnaw at the muscles where the tension was greatest,--carried down\r\nbelow. On the following morning the wings of the grasshopper were to\r\nbe seen on the rubbish heap in front of the nest. Dead house-flies\r\nand the larvæ of bees or wasps were at times readily devoured by\r\nmy captive ants (_barbara_). I have also seen large numbers of\r\n_structors_ engaged in picking the bones of a dead lizard, and\r\nwas once a witness of the following singular contest between a\r\nsoft-bodied, smooth, greyish caterpillar, exactly an inch in length,\r\nand two medium-sized _barbara_ ants. The ants were mere pigmies in\r\ncomparison of their prey, for as such I believe they regarded the\r\ncaterpillar, but they gripped its soft body with set mandibles,\r\nshowing the most savage determination not to loose their hold.\r\n\r\nWhen I first detected the group the war was being waged in a tuft\r\nof grass over one of the entrances to the ants' nest, and the\r\ncaterpillar was striding along the leaves, or thrusting itself\r\nbetween the culms in the hope to shake off or brush away its little\r\npersecutors. From time to time the caterpillar would turn viciously\r\nround and endeavour to pluck away its assailants, but though it\r\nactually succeeded in stripping off by means of its forelegs and\r\nmouth five of the six legs of one of the ants which was within its\r\nreach, they never once released their hold.\r\n\r\nAt length a chance movement of mine shook the grass leaf on which\r\nthey were, and ants and caterpillar rolled together down a steep and\r\nrocky slope to about four feet distant. They tumbled over and over\r\nseveral times, but still the ants gripped their prey as firmly as\r\never.\r\n\r\nThe last endeavour of the giant victim was to rub off the ants by\r\nburrowing into the soil, but on uncovering its retreat, I saw that\r\ntheir positions were still the same. After watching this struggle for\r\ntwenty minutes, time failed me, and I returned home, carrying with\r\nme, however, the combatants; and when on my return I opened the box\r\nin which they were imprisoned, these bull-dog ants were clinging with\r\nmandibles locked as firmly as ever, and now as I write, in death they\r\nare clinging still, drowned in a sea of spirits of wine.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter and spring I kept two colonies of _barbara_ captive\r\nin the house, placed in separate glass jars, each of which might\r\nperhaps hold half a gallon. The former of these colonies was taken on\r\nDecember 18; but neither the queen ant nor larvæ were found, though\r\nthere probably were larvæ in some unexplored part of the nest, and\r\nthe ants were always restless and miserable, unceasingly trying to\r\nescape, and dying in large numbers.\r\n\r\nOn February 12 I found that all these ants, though abundantly\r\nsupplied with seeds and all other kinds of food, were dead. Two other\r\ncolonies of ants, however, which had been taken in a torpid state\r\nin the masses of earth which formed part of the original nest, were\r\nalive and well, though still torpid.\r\n\r\nThe second captive colony, taken on December 28, with the wingless\r\nqueen ant and quantities of larvæ, formed a strong contrast with the\r\nprevious one. Here the ants at once set to work upon the construction\r\nof galleries and safety places for the larvæ below the even surface\r\nof garden mould on which I had placed them within the jar; for in\r\nthis case I did not attempt to preserve any portion of their own\r\nnest. This was done at 3.30 P.M., and by 9 that evening I found the\r\nants most busily at work, having in less than six hours excavated\r\neight deep orifices leading to galleries below, and surrounded these\r\norifices by crater-like heaps, made of the earth pellets which they\r\nhad thrown out. I have observed somewhat similar structures raised\r\nby _barbara_ after the nests have been closed on account of rain,\r\nand _structor_ frequently raises still more elaborate and distinct\r\ncraters, such as those represented at Fig. B, Plate II., p. 22\r\n(reduced one-half).\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the openings were ten in number, and the\r\ngreatly increased heaps of excavated earth showed that they must\r\nprobably have been at work all night. The amount of work done in this\r\nshort time was truly surprising, for it must be remembered that,\r\neighteen hours before, the earth presented a perfectly level surface,\r\nand the larvæ and ants, now housed below, found themselves prisoners\r\nin a strange place, bounded by glass walls, and with no exit possible.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the ants displayed extraordinary intelligence\r\nin having thus at a moment's notice devised a plan by which the\r\nsuperabundant number of workers could be employed at one time without\r\ncoming in one another's way. The soil contained in the jar was of\r\ncourse less than a tenth part of that comprised within the limits of\r\nan ordinary nest, while the number of workers was probably more than\r\na third of the total number belonging to the colony. If therefore\r\nbut one or two entrances had been pierced in the soil, the workers\r\nwould have been for ever running against one another, and a great\r\nnumber could never have got below to help in the all-important\r\ntask of preparing passages and chambers for the accommodation of\r\nthe larvæ. These numerous and funnel-shaped entrances admitted of\r\nthe simultaneous descent and ascent of large numbers of ants, and\r\nthe work progressed with proportionate rapidity. After a few days\r\nonly three entrances, and eventually only one remained open. Yet\r\nfor weeks this active work went on, and the ants brought up such\r\nquantities of earth from below that it became difficult to prevent\r\nthem from choking up the bottle containing their water, which they\r\nrepeatedly buried up to the neck. On January 10 the surface of the\r\nearth was raised from an inch and a half at its lowest, to three\r\ninches at its highest point above its original level, and this bulk\r\nof excavated earth represented the amount of space contained in\r\ntheir galleries and chambers constructed below. It was not, however,\r\nuntil nineteen days after their capture that the ants began to form\r\nsystematic trains to carry down the seeds which I placed for them\r\non the surface, and I suppose that they had required this time for\r\nthe construction and consolidation of the granary chambers. From\r\nthis time forward the ants came out repeatedly in greater or less\r\nforce to gather in the various seeds with which I supplied them.\r\nIndeed, throughout the whole of their captivity they seemed to be\r\nperfectly contented with their lot and free from disease, remarkably\r\nfew ants dying or appearing feeble, and as far as the limited space\r\nwould permit they reproduced most of the habits which I had noted as\r\nbelonging to them in a wild state, such as the formation of a rubbish\r\nheap; bringing out refuse materials, gnawed and empty seed-coats, the\r\nends of radicles, and root fibres which had penetrated their nest,\r\nand laying sprouted seeds in the air to dry after having gnawed off\r\nthe radicle in order to arrest their growth.\r\n\r\nI was also in this way able to see for myself much that I otherwise\r\ncould not have seen. Thus I was able to watch the operation of\r\nremoving roots which had pierced through their galleries, belonging\r\nto seedling plants growing on the surface, and which was performed\r\nby two ants, one pulling at the free end of the root, and the other\r\ngnawing at its fibres where the strain was greatest, until at length\r\nit gave way. Again the habit of throwing sick and apparently dead\r\nants into the water, the object of which was in part, I imagine,\r\nto be rid of them, and partly perhaps with a view to effecting a\r\npossible cure, for I have seen one ant carry another down the twig\r\nwhich formed their path to the surface of the water, and, after\r\ndipping it in for a minute, carry it laboriously up again, and lay it\r\nin the sun to dry and recover; thirdly, the stripping off the coats\r\nand husks of seed and grain swelling and on the point of sprouting,\r\nprevious to eating it; and finally, the actual eating of the contents\r\nof the seed.\r\n\r\nMost of these operations are usually performed below ground, and\r\neven in my captive nest it was but rarely that I could get a glimpse\r\nof their subterranean life, as they avoided the glass as much as\r\npossible, though it was carefully covered with flannel and black\r\npaper; and it was only by having the nest constantly before me on my\r\ntable, and thus becoming a witness of their operations day and night\r\nduring four months, that I detected them in positions which permitted\r\nme to watch these actions of theirs.\r\n\r\nThe ants were in the habit of coming out in numbers of an evening\r\nto enjoy the warmth and light of my lamp, and it was on one of\r\nthese occasions that I first observed them in the act of eating.\r\nI perceived that in the midst of the black mass of ants gathered\r\ntogether on the side of the glass jar one was holding up a white\r\nroundish mass about as big as a large pin's head. Having turned a\r\nstream of bright light passed through a condenser on this group, and\r\nbeing permitted by the ants to make free use of my pocket lens, I was\r\nable to see the details with great precision. The white mass appeared\r\nto be the floury portion of a grain of millet, and I could see that\r\ntwo or three ants at a time would scrape off minute particles with\r\ntheir toothed mandibles, and take them into their mouths, repeating\r\nthe operation many times, before giving place to other ants, and\r\noften returning again. It certainly appeared to be a _bonâ fide_\r\nmeal that they were making, and not merely an act performed for the\r\nbenefit of the larvæ, as when they detach crumbs from a piece of\r\nbread and carry them below into the nest. However, I must own that,\r\nthough I subsequently dissected ants taken in this act, which I\r\nsuppose to be that of eating, I was unable by the use of the iodine\r\ntest to detect starch grains in their stomachs.\r\n\r\nStill it seems quite possible that this failure may have been due to\r\nmy not having allowed the ants sufficient time to swallow their food,\r\nas I killed them almost immediately after disturbing them at their\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nAfter having twice observed the ants eating as above described, I\r\nmade some experiments in feeding them myself.\r\n\r\nThey immediately seized and set to work upon a minute ball of flour\r\nwhich I cut out from the centre of a grain of millet, taken from a\r\nheap in front of a nest of _A. structor_, which had begun to sprout\r\nand been deprived of its radicle and dried. A similar ball taken\r\nfrom a sprouting grain of millet, but the growth of which had not\r\nbeen arrested, was also partially eaten; but the hard, dry flour\r\ntaken from a grain of the same in its natural state, not moistened,\r\nwas at once rejected and thrown on the rubbish heap. The fat, oily\r\nseed leaves of the hemp, however, were eagerly taken, though not\r\nsoftened by water, their peculiar texture allowing the ants to\r\nscrape off particles, as in the case of the ball of flour of the\r\nsprouted millet. Under ordinary circumstances the hard shell of\r\nthe hemp-seed, and the coats of most other small fruits, grain, and\r\nseeds, would prevent the ants from getting at the contents while\r\ndry, but in the earliest stage of sprouting the shell parts of\r\nitself, allowing the radicle to protrude, and then they find their\r\nopportunity. (See Figs. A, A 2, Plate VI., p. 35.)\r\n\r\nIt has always been supposed that ants, from the delicate nature of\r\ntheir mouth organs, were only able to lap up liquids or to swallow\r\nvery soft animal tissues, and one of the great difficulties in the\r\nway of admitting that they might collect seeds for food, lay in the\r\napparent impossibility of their eating such hard substances. But\r\nit has generally been overlooked that not only are all seeds soft\r\nwhen moistened with water and ready to grow, but also that there are\r\ncertain kinds of seeds the contents of which are naturally soft.\r\n\r\nThe most important organs in an ant's mouth are shown in Fig. D 2,\r\nand D 3, in Plate I., p. 21. D 3 represents one of the horny, toothed\r\nmandibles, which serve admirably for scraping off particles of flour\r\nfrom the seeds. Within these are the parts shown at D 2, where the\r\noutermost pieces are the maxillæ and their four-jointed palpi or\r\nfeelers, and the innermost piece the labium and its three-jointed\r\npalpi, between which the end of the delicate membranous tongue\r\nappears.\r\n\r\nI repeatedly placed leaves from the orange trees covered with cocci\r\nand aphides from rose-bushes and pine trees, all of which are eagerly\r\nsought by several other kinds of ants, in the captive nest, but the\r\nants never looked twice at them, and this corresponds with the fact\r\nthat I have never seen either _structor_ or _barbara_ attending on\r\nor searching for aphides and the like. These captives took part of a\r\nsmall quantity of honey which I placed in the nest, but displayed no\r\neagerness about it, and soon neglected and allowed it to be covered\r\nup with earth thrown out from the nest.\r\n\r\nThe ants work very frequently at night during the dark,[32] and this\r\nis the case in the wild as well as in the captive nests. A friend,\r\nat my request twice visited a nest of _structor_ ants in the garden\r\nof an hotel at Mentone, when it was quite dark (in March, between\r\nseven and eight o'clock P.M.) and no moon, but the light of a candle\r\nshowed that the workers, both large and small, were busily engaged\r\nin carrying into the nest seeds which had been purposely scattered\r\nin their neighbourhood. I have myself seen _Pheidole megacephala_\r\nsimilarly engaged at about nine P.M. on a warm night in April, when\r\nit was perfectly dark, not even the stars showing; but in this\r\ncase the ants were collecting from the weeds in the garden. On the\r\nsame occasion I also observed long and active trains of _Formica\r\nemarginata_ [a rather small dusky ant, with a yellow thorax], making\r\nfor the orange-trees in search of cocci and aphides, just as if it\r\nwere broad day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: This bears out the much-questioned assertion of\r\nAristotle, though he only claimed that ants work \"by night when the\r\nmoon is at the full.\"--Hist. Anim., lib. ix. cap. xxvi.]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Mentone, on May 1, I turned out this second captive\r\nnest, and found that the colony appeared perfectly healthy, and\r\ndid not seem to have diminished materially in numbers. The queen\r\nant and the larvæ seemed to be in just the same state as when they\r\nwere taken. The earth in the lower part of the jar was honeycombed\r\nwith galleries, granaries, and cells, constructed quite as in the\r\nwild nests, but more crowded together. The granaries were in many\r\ninstances full of seeds, which, though very wet, [the surrounding\r\nsoil being extremely moist on account of there being no drainage to\r\ncarry off the water which I was obliged to sprinkle from time to time\r\nover the surface of the nest], still showed no trace of germination\r\nthat I could detect. The ants were therefore able to exercise the\r\nsame influence over these seeds, under the strange conditions of\r\ntheir captive state, that they do in their natural homes.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks, as has been stated above, refer for the most\r\npart to only one of the three kinds of harvesting ants which I have\r\nobserved on the Riviera--that is to say, to _Atta barbara_, the\r\njet-black ant.\r\n\r\nAs far as the manner of collecting and storing the seed is concerned,\r\nall that has been said of _Atta barbara_ applies with equal truth to\r\n_A. structor_.\r\n\r\n_A. structor_ is, however, less frequently seen above ground from\r\nDecember to March than _barbara_, and is more frequently found in or\r\nnear the streets and gardens of a town.\r\n\r\nThe fourth species, on the other hand, the little _Pheidole\r\nmegacephala_, differs in several particulars. This ant appears to\r\nshun the daylight, and to be most active at night, when, in the warm\r\nweather at the end of April, it may frequently be seen carrying large\r\nquantities of seeds into its nest. I have rarely observed it at work\r\nin the daylight, so that my knowledge of its habits is but small. Nor\r\nhave I succeeded in discovering its subterranean granaries, though\r\nI have opened several nests. Still, I believe that it is a true\r\nharvesting ant, and not merely a casual collector of seeds. Of the\r\nhabits of _Pheidole pallidula_, a very closely allied and similar\r\nspecies, but one less frequently met with, I cannot speak with\r\ncertainty, though it is quite possible that it also may be a true\r\nharvester, in which case it would add a fifth species to this class.\r\n\r\nBoth _Pheidole megacephala_ and _Ph. pallidula_ appear to remain\r\ninactive, or nearly so, during the months from November to April, and\r\nit is probable that they are only to be seen in full activity during\r\nthe summer when I am not there to watch them.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that any naturalist who will take the pains\r\nto note the habits of ants on the shores of the Mediterranean through\r\nJune, July, August, and September, might collect a most interesting\r\nseries of observations on harvesting and other species, and add to,\r\nand perhaps modify, those which my limited opportunities have enabled\r\nme to make.\r\n\r\nThere are three other ants[33]--namely, _Formica emarginata_, _F.\r\nfusca_, and _Myrmica cæspitum_, which may also occasionally be found\r\ncarrying a few seeds, but this is the rare exception, as far as my\r\nexperience goes, these species living on honey dew, sweet secretions,\r\nand animal matter, like the great majority of ants all over the\r\nworld. I have never found seeds in the nests of any ants except those\r\nof _Atta barbara_ and _A. structor_, though I have carefully searched\r\nfor them in most of the nests of the sixteen species of ants whose\r\nhabits I have watched.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: For some details of the habits of the sixteen species\r\nof ants observed on the Riviera, see Appendix A.]\r\n\r\nThere is every probability that these harvesting ants will be found\r\nall round the shores of the Mediterranean, but the only points at\r\nwhich I have positively heard of the existence of the habit besides\r\nMentone, Cannes, and Marseilles, are Capri[34] and Algiers. I am\r\nindebted to Miss Forster for having, during a short visit to Algiers,\r\ndevoted some time to watching the habits of the ants in a garden at\r\nthat place. These observations were made in April last (1872), when\r\nthe three following species were watched:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Where a harvester, probably _Atta barbara_, has been\r\nobserved by Mr. Buchanan White. See Appendix C.]\r\n\r\n(1) _Formica (Cataglyphis) viatica_, a large, long-legged, blackish\r\nant, with orange-red and semi-transparent thorax, which never carried\r\nseeds, but lived on animal food, especially flies. (2) _Formica\r\n(Tapinoma) nigerrima_,[35] a rather small dusky ant, which brought in\r\nsome seeds to its nest, but principally \"animal food, flies, small\r\nworms,\" &c., and which did not carry the hemp and canary seed strewed\r\nin their path, though on one occasion when Miss Forster scattered\r\nsome split hemp seed, they eagerly fastened upon the contents, and\r\nate some on the spot, while they transported the greater part to\r\ntheir nest, and (3) _Atta barbara_, which, as on the Riviera, was a\r\ntrue and most active harvester, and eagerly seized upon the hemp and\r\ncanary seed when these were placed in its way.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Mr. Smith thinks that this ant is either _F.\r\nnigerrima_, of Nylander, or a new species, but it was not possible\r\nfor him to pronounce with absolute certainty as he had only two\r\nspecimens of workers from which to judge.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation and Concluding Remarks._\r\n\r\nThere are some points of interest suggesting openings for future\r\nobservation, to which I will now allude, making at the same time a\r\npartial recapitulation of what has gone before.\r\n\r\nWe have learned in the first place that the ancients had facts\r\non their side when they said that the ant is one of the very few\r\ncreatures which lays up supplies of food sufficient to last for\r\nmonths, or even perhaps, as Bochart says, for a whole year; and\r\nthough we cannot quite accept the statement that \"there is no animal\r\nexcept men, mice, and ants, that stores its food,\"[36] they were\r\nright in saying that the habit is a most singular and interesting\r\none. It is probable, however, that the old writers may have fallen\r\ninto the error of supposing that all ants were harvesters, though the\r\ntruth appears to be, that even in hot climates, it is only a very\r\nsmall number of species that are so. The fact that certain ants in\r\nSouthern Europe do store large quantities of sound seed in damp soil,\r\nand check their tendency to germinate, may be thought to favour the\r\npossibility of the existence of those deeply hidden supplies of seed\r\nwhich, though they have never been detected, are popularly supposed\r\nto explain the sudden appearance of the crops of weeds on soil newly\r\nbrought out from great depths.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Sophian, quoted by Bochart in his Hierozoïcon, ii. cap.\r\nxxi, p. 497.]\r\n\r\nThe argument may be stated thus: seeds remain for months undecayed,\r\nand still capable of germination, at depths varying from one to\r\ntwenty inches below the surface of the soil in certain ants' nests,\r\nwhy should they not lie hidden for indefinite periods in ordinary\r\nsoil?\r\n\r\nTo answer this positively, experiments should be made[37] in order\r\nthat we might learn whether these seeds can retain their vitality\r\nwithout sprouting in moist soil; but the general belief is that under\r\nthese conditions they will do one of two things, they will either\r\ngrow or rot. Be this as it may, one of the most curious points that\r\nwe have learned about these ants, is that they know how to preserve\r\nseeds intact, even when within from one to three inches of the\r\nsurface of the ground, that is to say, at the actual depth at which a\r\ngardener most frequently sows his seeds, though if these very seeds\r\nare taken out of the granary and sowed by hand, they will germinate\r\nin the ordinary way. It is possible that this may be in part due\r\nto the compact nature of the floors and ceilings of the granaries,\r\nthese excluding air in some measure, though as moisture freely passes\r\nthrough them, and there are always two or three open galleries\r\nleading into the granaries, and which communicate directly with the\r\nopen air, I can scarcely accept this explanation as complete.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: In order to try the experiment fairly, seeds taken\r\nfrom ants' nests, or seeds of the same species as those which are\r\nhabitually found in ants' nests, should be placed at different depths\r\nin the earth and examined after the lapse of six or eight months.\r\n\r\nWhy it is that certain seeds resist the influences which destroy\r\nthe vitality of other seeds of closely allied species is another\r\nand a very curious but complicated problem, the explanation of\r\nwhich may perhaps lie in the different chemical properties of the\r\nseeds in question, in the more or less permeable character of their\r\nseed-coats, or their general texture.]\r\n\r\nThe seeds do occasionally sprout in the nest, though it is extremely\r\nrare to find instances of this, and then the ants nip off the little\r\nroot, and carry each seed out into the air and sun, exactly as the\r\nold writers have described, and when the growth has been checked and\r\nthe seed malted by exposure, they fetch them in again. It is in this\r\ncondition that the ants like best to eat them, as I have proved by\r\nexperiments among my captives.\r\n\r\nAs the ants often travel some distance from their nest in search of\r\nfood, they may certainly be said to be, in a limited sense, agents\r\nin the dispersal of seeds, for they not unfrequently drop seeds by\r\nthe way, which they fail to find again, and also among the refuse\r\nmatter which forms the kitchen midden in front of their entrances,\r\na few sound seeds are often present, and these in many instances\r\ngrow up and form a little colony of stranger plants. This presence\r\nof seedlings foreign to the wild ground in which the nest is usually\r\nplaced, is quite a feature where there are old established colonies\r\nof _Atta barbara_, as is shown at Fig. A in Plate I., p. 21, where\r\nyoung plants of fumitory, chickweed, cranesbill, _Arabis Thaliana_,\r\n&c., may be seen on or near the rubbish heap.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to make a list of all these ant-imported\r\nplants, and I think it quite likely that, if a sufficiently large\r\nnumber of nests were visited, some seedlings of cultivated species\r\nmight be found amongst them, for we have seen that garden plants are\r\nfrequently put under contribution.\r\n\r\nOne can imagine cases in which the ants during the lapse of long\r\nperiods of time might pass the seeds of plants from colony to\r\ncolony, until after a journey of many stages, the descendants of the\r\nant-borne seedlings might find themselves transported to places far\r\nremoved from the original home of their immediate ancestors. It is a\r\ntrue cause, but at the same time it may be one which has, like many\r\ntrue causes, exceedingly small effects. One can scarcely look at the\r\nteeming population of an ant's nest, without asking whether there\r\nare any checks to their increase, and if so, what these checks are.\r\nI know very little of what foreign enemies they may have, though I\r\nhave occasionally seen them captured by lizards, _Cicindela_ beetles,\r\nand spiders,[38] and it is well known that the females are eagerly\r\nsought for by birds at the season when they are above ground, and\r\nabout to found new colonies; but I believe that ants are the ants'\r\nworst enemies, for fearful slaughter and mutilation often result from\r\nthe encounter of armies of the same race, but belonging to different\r\nnests.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: I have seen the remains of ants at the bottom of\r\nthe tube of trap-door spider nests, and watched a hunting spider,\r\n_Lycosa_, capture a large black ant (_Formica pubescens_), by\r\nentangling it in threads, which it deftly spun about its limbs, while\r\nrunning rapidly round the struggling victim in a circle, and dodging\r\nout of the way of the ant's mandibles. In England one may frequently\r\nsee ants caught in the spiders' webs among the rose-bushes, and Mr.\r\nBlackwall says, in his Spiders of Great Britain and Ireland, that\r\n_Theridion riparium_ lives principally on ants.]\r\n\r\nHarvesting ants have nothing to do, as far as I have been able to\r\ndiscover, with aphides, cocci, and the like, nor do they seek for\r\nany of those sweet secretions which are the staple food of the\r\ngenerality of ants; they live, however, on very friendly terms with\r\ncertain yellowish-white and satiny-coated \"silver-fish\" (_Lepisma_),\r\nwhich are found in the passages and chambers of the nests; but what\r\ntheir relations are to these creatures and to certain beetles which\r\nhave been found in the nests of _Atta barbara_ in Spain and Syria\r\nis unknown. It is possible that by carefully watching captive ants\r\nin company with these creatures under very favourable conditions,\r\nsomething further might be learned on this head. My captive ants\r\nconstructed all their chambers, granaries, and almost all their\r\ngalleries away from the glass, and in the interior of the earth,\r\nthough I tried to tempt them to work in parts more accessible to\r\nsight by swathing the jar in flannel.\r\n\r\nThere is much to be learned, I do not doubt, about the friends and\r\nenemies of harvesting ants; and another great desideratum is further\r\ninformation as to the parts of the world in which they are found and\r\nwhat causes may be assigned for the limitation of the habit.\r\n\r\nWhat is the geographical distribution of the harvesting species,\r\nand what the geographical distribution of the habit? For instance,\r\nto quote Mr. F. Smith,[39] _Atta structor_, though not \"found in\r\nEngland, is scattered over a great part of Europe, having occurred in\r\nFrance, Italy, Germany, Austria, Dalmatia, and Switzerland; it has\r\nalso been found in Algeria\" and Syria; and _A. barbara_ is almost as\r\nwidely spread. May we then conclude that these species are harvesters\r\nwherever they are found, and that they store seed in Germany and\r\nSwitzerland as freely as they do on the shores of the Mediterranean?\r\nIf this be really so, then Huber, whose attention was specially\r\ndirected to this point, and a host of laborious and scrupulous\r\nobservers of the Continent, have had the very fact under their eyes,\r\nthough they have been at considerable pains expressly to deny it.\r\nI cannot think that this is likely, but it is a matter which could\r\neasily be settled by those who travel or reside in Germany, Northern\r\nFrance, or Switzerland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Mr. F. Smith, On Some New Species of Ants from the Holy\r\nLand, in Journ. Linnean Soc., London, vol. vi. p. 35.]\r\n\r\nIt seems to me more probable, however, that they do store in the\r\nsouth, but not in the north; for all the difficulties which attend\r\nthe preservation of the seed in the granaries in the south would\r\nbe greatly increased in the wet climates of Northern Europe, and\r\nthere, moreover, the greater cold would render the ants torpid almost\r\nthroughout the winter, when food would not be required. But the\r\nquestion is plainly an open one. We may also ask why it is that only\r\na very few out of the many species of ants which inhabit the shores\r\nof the Mediterranean should possess this habit of collecting seeds,\r\nand differ so widely in their manner of living, from their neighbours?\r\n\r\nIf we wish to put ourselves in the way to answer these queries,\r\nthe first thing we should do would be to examine and compare\r\nthe structure of the digestive organs and parts of the mouth in\r\nharvesters and non-harvesters, with a view to seeing whether there\r\nmay not be some capital difference here.\r\n\r\nThese observations demand some skill in dissection and preparation,\r\nand in regretting that it has not been in my power to make them, I\r\ncan only hope that some one more skilled than I am may undertake the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable, that in warmer latitudes there are many conditions\r\nwhich favour the rapid increase of ants, so that a given tract of\r\ncountry in Southern Europe, for example, must have on an average more\r\ncolonies to support than a similar tract in the north, and that to\r\nmeet this increase of population, it has therefore become necessary\r\nfor these creatures to seek their subsistence from as many and as\r\ndissimilar sources as possible. The fierce conflicts over booty both\r\nbetween rival nests of the same and of distinct species, tend to\r\nshow that, even as things are, they frequently have to fight for\r\ntheir food.\r\n\r\nHitherto, as far as I have been able to learn, only nineteen true\r\nharvesting ants have been detected in the whole world, limiting\r\nthis term to those species which make the collection of seeds the\r\nprincipal occupation of their outdoor lives, and are evidently in the\r\nmain dependent upon this kind of food for subsistence.\r\n\r\nNow if we compare these nineteen species of ants[40] together a very\r\ncurious fact forces itself upon our notice--namely, that all of them\r\nare closely related, so much so that not only do all belong to the\r\nsame division of ants (the tribe _Myrmicineæ_), but that with one\r\nexception (_Pseudomyrma_) all would have been placed by the great\r\nFabricius in one genus, _Atta_, and the one exception is not far\r\nremoved from it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: These are _Myrmica (Atta) barbata_, from Texas and\r\nMexico; _Œcodoma (Atta) cephalotes_, from Brazil and Mexico; _Œcodoma\r\n(Atta) providens_, from India; _Œcodoma (Atta) diffusa_, from India;\r\n_Atta rufa_, from India; _Pheidole (Atta) megacephala_, from South\r\nFrance; _Atta barbara_, from South France, Capri, and Algiers; _Atta\r\nstructor_, from South France; and _Pseudomyrma rufo nigra_, from\r\nIndia.]\r\n\r\nWe must not forget, however, that, as has been stated, there are\r\nother ants which do occasionally collect seeds, and thus appear to\r\nshow traces of this remarkable instinct; but as far as I have yet\r\nseen, it is always possible to distinguish them readily from true\r\nharvesters. Still I think it very likely that in hot climates the\r\ndivision between harvesters and non-harvesters may be bridged over by\r\na complete chain of intermediates. Here two more questions suggest\r\nthemselves for more complete future solution. (1) Do true harvesters\r\nwhich store seed in granaries ever attend upon aphides and seek for\r\nsweet secretions? (2) Do occasional harvesters ever form granaries?\r\n\r\nIn any case the name of \"the provident one\" is only, I suspect, fully\r\ndeserved by a limited number of ants, and Æsop, in his well-known\r\nfable, might as properly have made the dialogue which ends in the\r\nrecommendation to \"dance in winter as he piped in summer,\" take place\r\nbetween two ants as between an ant and a grasshopper, as far at least\r\nas their respective foresight is concerned.\r\n\r\nWhy it is that one ant should require stores of food in the winter of\r\nwhich other ants have no need, is one of the many problems which only\r\npatient watching and careful comparison and experiment can help us to\r\nsolve.\r\n\r\nThere are not wanting those among the many winter visitors of the\r\nsouth who have time in abundance or superabundance at their disposal,\r\nand might help to clear up these and many other mysteries, and to\r\nthem I would strongly recommend the study of the habits of plants and\r\nanimals as a pastime, if nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe way is open: it is not difficult to follow, and it leads to very\r\npleasant places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nThe following are the species of ants which I have observed on the\r\nRiviera, and principally at Mentone; the actual locality where my\r\nnotes were taken being given in every case.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Family Formicidæ._[41]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Ants have been divided into three tribes, the two first\r\nof which, _Formicineæ_ and _Ponerineæ_, are distinguished by the\r\nlatter having a contraction in the abdomen not found in the former,\r\nand both are separated from the third tribe, _Myrmicineæ_ by having\r\nbut a single scale on the petiole, while in _Myrmicineæ_ there are\r\nalways two nodes or protuberances on the petiole. It is important to\r\nremember the difference between the first and the last named tribes,\r\nas we shall find that all the true harvesters belong to _Myrmicineæ_.\r\nI have not seen any of the representatives of the second tribe in the\r\nsouth.]\r\n\r\n_Tribe Formicineæ._--Petiole (or stalk which unites the thorax and\r\nthe abdomen) of one joint, and furnished with a single vertical\r\nscale, abdomen not contracted.\r\n\r\n(1) _Formica fusca_, Linn.--A rather large ant (3-1/2 to 4-1/2 lines\r\nlong), of a blackish ash colour, with a satiny sheen on the upper\r\nhalf of the abdomen. Smells of formic acid when crushed. Lives upon\r\nsweet secretions and animal matter, and occasionally carries a very\r\nfew seeds into its nest, which is made in the ground. (Mentone.)\r\n\r\n(2) _F. emarginata_, Latr.--Of medium size (2-1/2 lines), brownish,\r\nwith yellow thorax. Has a strong smell of honey when crushed. Lives\r\nprincipally upon sweet secretions, but occasionally carries a very\r\nfew seeds also. Nest in the ground. (Mentone.)\r\n\r\n(3) _F. (Camponotus) cruentata_, Lat.--Large (5 to 6 lines), dusky\r\nbrown, with orange red on legs and abdomen. Strong smell of formic\r\nacid. Lives on sweet secretions and animal matter, and has never\r\nbeen seen by me carrying seeds. Nest in the ground. (Mentone and\r\nCannes.)\r\n\r\n(4) _F. (Camponotus) marginata_, Latr.--Large (4 to 5-1/2 lines),\r\nblack. Has no perceptible smell even when crushed. Lives principally\r\non sweet secretions, and does not bring in seeds to its nest, which\r\nis made in the ground. I have seen this ant at Cannes ascending the\r\ncork oaks in search of certain cocci which resemble black and shining\r\nberries rather larger than a pea, and which exude sweet secretions.\r\n(Mentone and Cannes.)\r\n\r\n(5) _Formica cursor_, Fonscol.--A rather large but slender ant (3 to\r\n4 lines long), nearly black, with a faint bronzy hue, legs very long.\r\nSmell not noted. Runs very swiftly, and is hard to catch; feeds on\r\nsweet secretions, and does not carry seeds. Nest in ground. (Cannes.)\r\n\r\n(6) _F._ (species undetermined).--A large ant (5 to 6-1/2 lines),\r\nblack brown with yellow thorax and legs. In shape resembles _F.\r\nmarginata_. Strong smell of formic acid. Habits not observed. Nest\r\nfound under a stone in a pine wood. (Cannes.)\r\n\r\n(7) _F._ (species undetermined).--A rather large ant (3 to 4-1/2\r\nlines), resembling _F. fusca_, but having the thorax yellow. Strong\r\nsmell of formic acid. Feeds on sweet secretions, and does not carry\r\nseeds. Nest in ground. (Cannes.)\r\n\r\n(8) _Formica (Tapinoma) erratica_, Latr.--Rather small (2 lines),\r\nnearly black. Has a strong and most disagreeable smell, something\r\nlike rancid oil, which is emitted if the nest is disturbed or the\r\ninsect crushed. Lives upon sweet secretions and animal matter, but\r\nrarely if ever carries seeds, and pays no attention to them if placed\r\nin its path. It nests in the ground, and forms superficial covered\r\nways, roofed in with a thin crust of earth and vegetable fibres\r\ncemented together. (Mentone, Cannes.)\r\n\r\n_Tribe Myrmicineæ_. Petiole two jointed, furnished with two nodes\r\n(protuberances).\r\n\r\n(9) _Crematogaster (Myrmica) scutellaris_, Oliv.--Of medium\r\nsize (3-1/2 to 4 lines), nearly black, with yellowish red head.\r\nDisagreeable smell like rancid oil when crushed. Erects the abdomen\r\nwhen excited, and runs about with it turned up at right angles to\r\nthe body. Lives on sweet secretions, and does not carry seeds. When\r\ndissecting the abdomen of this ant, I noticed that in freshly killed\r\nspecimens a drop of poison appears at the extremity of the sting,\r\nwhich if brushed away will form again several times in succession.\r\nNest in the bark and wood of sick or decayed trees. (Mentone and\r\nCannes.)\r\n\r\n(10) _C. sordidulus_, Mayr.--Very small (1-1/2 to 2 lines), resembles\r\n_C. scutellaris_, but is uniformly black brown. No perceptible smell.\r\nLives on sweet secretions, and may frequently be seen inside flowers.\r\nNest in earth. Behaves like _C. scutellaris_ when excited. (Mentone\r\nand Cannes.)\r\n\r\n(11) _Myrmica cæspitum_, Latr.--Small (2 lines), brown. Faint smell\r\nlike peat smoke. Feeds on animal food and sweet secretions, and may\r\noccasionally be seen collecting and carrying in seeds. Nest in the\r\nground. (Mentone and Cannes.)\r\n\r\n (12) _Pheidole (Atta or Myrmica) megacephala_.--Very small (1-1/2 to\r\n2 lines), yellow, the larger workers having enormous heads. Smell\r\nvery peculiar, and a trifle like aniseed when crushed. Appears to\r\nbe a true harvester, and not to seek for sweet secretions. Nest in\r\nground. (Mentone and Cannes.)\r\n\r\n(13) _Ph. (Atta or Myrmica) pallidula_.--Very small (1-1/2 lines),\r\npale yellow, closely resembles _Ph. megacephala_, but is paler and\r\nmore transparent, and the larger workers have less disproportionate\r\nheads. Smell not noted. Habits not fully observed. Nest in ground.\r\n(Mentone.)\r\n\r\n(14) _Atta (Aphenogaster or Myrmica) structor_.--Rather large (2 to 4\r\nlines), of a claret brown. No smell when crushed. A true harvester,\r\nand does not appear to seek for sweet secretions, though it will\r\noccasionally take animal food. Nest in ground or under stones.\r\n(Mentone and Cannes.)\r\n\r\n(15) _Atta (Aph. or Myrmica) barbara_.--Rather large (2 to 4 lines),\r\njet black. No smell when crushed. Habits of _structor_. Nest in\r\nearth, and more frequently in uncultivated ground. I have twice\r\nseen a few ants coloured like _structor_ in colonies of _barbara_.\r\n(Mentone, Cannes, and Marseilles.)\r\n\r\n(16) _Atta (Aph. or Myrmica) barbara_ var.--A large ant (3 to 6\r\nlines). The larger workers black, with red or mahogany-coloured\r\nheads, the smaller most frequently black, and like those of _Atta\r\nbarbara_, of which this is probably only a variety. It differs\r\nhowever in its smell, which, when the body is crushed, resembles that\r\nof _Pheidole megacephala_, and is something like aniseed. Habits of\r\n_structor_ and _barbara_. Nest in earth. On one occasion I opened\r\na large nest at Cannes, where the colony was composed in about\r\nequal parts of ants which in colour and appearance might be said to\r\nrepresent the three forms, _structor_, _barbara_, and the red-headed\r\nvariety of the latter. There were also a few ants with pale yellowish\r\nbrown heads. (Mentone and Cannes.)\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\nThe following Indian species are described by the late Dr. Jerdon as\r\nharvesters, in the Madras Journal Lit. and Sc. 1851:--\r\n\r\n(p. 45). _Atta rufa._--\"Its favourite food is dead insects and other\r\nmatter, but it also carries off seeds like the _Œcodoma_, chaff,\"\r\n&c. &c. (p. 46). _Œcodoma providens._--\"Their common food I suspect\r\nto be animal matter, dead insects, &c. &c., which at all events they\r\ntake readily, but they also carry off large quantities of seeds of\r\nvarious kinds, especially light grass seeds, and more especially\r\ngarden seeds, as every gardener knows to his cost. They will take\r\noff cabbage, celery, radish, carrot, and tomato seeds, and in some\r\ngardens, unless the pots in which they are sown be suspended or\r\notherwise protected, the whole of the seeds sown will be removed in\r\none night. I have also had many packets of seeds (especially lettuce)\r\nin my room completely emptied before I was aware that the ants had\r\ndiscovered them. I do not know, however, if they eat them or feed\r\ntheir larvæ on them, though for what other purpose they carry them\r\noff I cannot divine. I have often observed them bring the seeds\r\noutside their holes, as recorded by Colonel Sykes, and this I think\r\ngenerally at the close of the rainy season; but in some cases I had\r\nreason to believe that it was merely the husks, of which I have seen\r\nquite heaps, and that the ants did not take them back to their nests.\r\nIf any of the forementioned seeds be sown out at once in a bed, most\r\nlikely in the morning the surface of the whole spot will be found\r\ncovered over with little ridges, the works of these creatures, and\r\nthe few seeds that perhaps remain, dug all round, and being carried\r\noff sometimes above ground, at other times under ground. Their\r\ngalleries and subterranean passages are often very extensive, and it\r\nis no easy matter to dig down to their nest to see what becomes of\r\nthe seeds.\" _Œcodoma diffusa_ has the same habits as _Œ. providens_.\r\n\r\nLieut.-Col. Sykes, _Descriptions of New Indian Ants_ in _Trans. Ent.\r\nSoc. Lond._, i. 103 (1836).\r\n\r\n_Atta providens_, Sykes. \"In illustration of the habits of this\r\nspecies of ant, I shall give the following extract from my\r\ndiary:--'Poona, June 19, 1829. In my morning walk I observed more\r\nthan a score of little heaps of grass-seeds (_Panicum_) in several\r\nplaces on uncultivated land near the parade-ground; each heap\r\ncontained about a handful. On examination, I found they were raised\r\nby the above species of ant, hundreds of which were employed in\r\nbringing up the seeds to the surface from a store below; the grain\r\nhad probably got wet at the setting in of the monsoon, and the ants\r\nhad taken advantage of the first sunny day to bring it up to dry.\r\nThe store must have been laid up from the time of the ripening of\r\nthe grass-seeds in January and February. As I was aware this fact\r\nmilitated against the observations of entomologists in Europe, I was\r\ncareful not to deceive myself by confounding the seeds of a _Panicum_\r\nwith the pupæ of the insect. Each ant was charged with a single seed,\r\nbut as it was too weighty for many of them, and as the strongest had\r\nsome difficulty in scaling the perpendicular sides of the cylindrical\r\nhole leading to the nest below, many were the falls of the weaker\r\nants with their burdens from near the summit to the bottom. I\r\nobserved they never relaxed their hold, and with a perseverance\r\naffording a useful lesson to humanity, steadily recommenced the\r\nascent after each successive tumble, nor halted in their labour until\r\nthey had crowned the summit, and lodged their burden on the common\r\nheap.'\"\r\n\r\n(p. 104). \"On the 13th of October of the same year, after the closing\r\nthunderstorms of the monsoon, I found this species in various places\r\nsimilarly employed as they had been in June preceding; one heap\r\ncontained a double handful of grass-seeds. It is probable that the\r\n_Atta providens_ is a field species of ant, as I have not observed it\r\nin the houses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\nAfter the appearance of a brief notice of a communication which I\r\nsent in the winter of 1871-72 to the London Entomological Society,\r\nannouncing the fact that certain ants harvest seeds in a systematic\r\nway at Mentone, two papers were published, in which confirmatory\r\nevidence of the existence of the habit in other parts of the world\r\nwas set forth--one by Mr. Buchanan White, and the other by the late\r\nMr. Horne.\r\n\r\nMr. Horne's account of his observations was published in _Hardwicke's\r\nScience Gossip_, No. 89, p. 109 (for May 1, 1872), and runs as\r\nfollows:[42]--\r\n\r\n\"My notes carry me to the far East, where I have often watched\r\nthis most interesting class of insects, and briefly recorded my\r\nobservations--unfortunately cut short by illness, and the necessity\r\nof return to Europe, which must be my apology for their want of\r\ncompleteness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: I omit the preliminary portion, in which my\r\nobservations are erroneously stated to have been made at Nismes and\r\nCapri.]\r\n\r\n\"But before transcribing, I would remind my general reader that\r\nall ants may be seen carrying off food to their nests for present\r\nconsumption, and that this food consists of a great variety of\r\nsubstances. This is disposed of inside the said nest, being often\r\nmasticated, and the juice extracted by the workers, and then given\r\nin an inspissated form from their mouths to the young grubs, which\r\nare in general tended by their nurses with the greatest care. It is\r\nindeed very curious to watch this feeding process; but to proceed.\r\n\r\n\"Under date Nov. 7th, 1866, I find in my natural history note-book as\r\nfollows:--Mainpuri. This morning as I was walking across the 'Oosur,'\r\nor waste plain, where it was very sandy, being cut into small\r\nravines, and clothed only here and there with fine grass disposed in\r\nclumps, thus forming little hillocks of sand blown by the wind, and\r\narrested in its course by the grass, I came across a long line of\r\nants, travelling four deep, some coming empty, and others laden each\r\nwith one grass-seed, on their way home.\r\n\r\n\"I followed up the procession to the nest, which was subterranean,\r\nand at the mouth of which on the level plain there was no trace of\r\nelevation caused by the soil brought up from below, owing to the\r\nhabit of these ants of taking each grain of sand to some distance\r\nalong their road, and depositing it on one side or the other.\r\n\r\n\"There may have been five or six entrances to the nest, in and out\r\nof which a prodigious number of ants were passing, the species\r\nof which has been described by Dr. Jerdon. They were of a medium\r\nsize, shortish bodies, and of a reddish-brown colour--_Pseudomyrma\r\nrufo-nigra_, Jerdon. Around the mouth of the nest, forming a circle\r\nof perhaps eighteen inches in diameter, was a space beaten flat, and\r\nkept clear by these said ants, from which radiated in every direction\r\nthirteen roads, each about four inches in width for about thirty\r\nto forty yards, when they branched off and became narrower, being\r\nultimately lost amongst the grass roots. These paths were fairly\r\nstraight; they did not cut through elevations, but went round them.\r\n\r\n\"From a careful examination it appeared that they had been cleared\r\nof all obstacles, such as small stones, twigs, &c., but that their\r\nsmoothness resulted only from the tread of countless feet.\r\n\r\n\"The bearers of burdens took the seeds _into_ the nest, which I did\r\nnot dig up, and certainly stored them there, after having prepared\r\nthem, probably by the removal of a portion of the outer husk. Of\r\nthese husks there were large collections near the entrances to the\r\nnest, all carefully set aside by the ants.\r\n\r\n\"In times of famine, I am told, not only are the nests rifled of\r\ntheir grass-seed stores, but these heaps of apparent husks are\r\ncollected and ground with other grain to eke out a subsistence.\r\n\r\n\"This kind of grain has a name, 'Jurroon,' derived from 'Jharna,' to\r\nsweep, literally sweepings. I much regret that I have not preserved\r\nspecimens of this 'Jurroon,' for it is very unlikely that the ants\r\nafter taking it to their granary, should again throw it out, and yet,\r\nif grainless, what benefit could there be in eating it? The season\r\nof the year when I observed them (November) is the beginning of the\r\ncold weather, and no rain would probably fall (excepting a little at\r\nChristmas) till next May or June. Later on seed would be rare; and\r\nhow the nest fares at a time when floods of water often pass over the\r\nplain I cannot conceive.\r\n\r\n\"It is clear that some escape, and we know with what prodigious\r\nrapidity these colonies increase. But these jottings have been\r\nrecorded merely to show how this species of ant store grain against a\r\ntime of scarcity, and fully bear out the statement in the text with\r\nwhich I commenced this paper.\"\r\n\r\nThe following are Dr. Buchanan White's notes, alluded to above,\r\npublished in the _Transactions of the Entomological Society_ (London,\r\n1872) part i., Proceedings, p. v.:--\r\n\r\n\"Capri, June 3, 1866. In the afternoon to the Punta Tragara, where a\r\ncolony of ants afforded us much amusement. These little insects had\r\na regular road, made by cutting away the grass and other plants in\r\ntheir way. This road was about one inch and a half wide, and several\r\nyards long, and led to a clump of plants in seed. Along this road\r\na long train of ants were perpetually travelling to the nest (or\r\n_formicarium_), bearing with them pods of leguminous plants, seeds of\r\ngrass and of Composites (_Chrysanth. segetum_), &c.\r\n\r\n\"The perseverance with which a single ant would tug and draw a pod\r\nfour times his own length was very interesting; sometimes three or\r\nfour ants would unite in carrying one burden. Near the formicarium\r\nwas a great mass of débris, consisting of empty pods, twigs, emptied\r\nsnail shells, &c., cast out by the ants. The seeds appeared to be\r\nstored inside the nest, as in one that I opened the other day I found\r\na large collection. The species was a black ant; the formicarium was\r\nunderground.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nD.\r\n\r\n_On Collecting and Examining Ants._\r\n\r\nThere are very few branches of natural history which might be more\r\neasily followed by a traveller, or one who fears to encumber\r\nhimself with bulky collections difficult to transport from place to\r\nplace, than the study of ants. The whole European ant fauna might be\r\nadequately represented by specimens preserved in spirit of wine and\r\npacked in the compass of a hat-box.\r\n\r\nIn taking specimens of ants it is important never to put the\r\nrepresentatives of more than one nest in each bottle, but then in\r\nmost cases a sufficient number may be placed in a single bottle of\r\nthe size used for containing the smaller homœopathic globules. If\r\npossible the winged male and female ants, as well as the wingless\r\nworkers, should be secured.\r\n\r\nThe ants die very quickly in pure spirit of wine, and they can\r\nafterwards, even after the lapse of months or more, be pinned out in\r\nthe cabinet after having been washed in warm water. In examining the\r\nmouth organs of an ant in order to determine by the aid of books to\r\nwhat genus it belongs, it is best to relax the parts by first washing\r\naway the spirit of wine, and then leaving the specimen for a day or\r\nmore in a stopper bottle partly filled with finely chopped laurel\r\nleaves. It is probable that a drop or two of prussic acid on a bit of\r\nsponge might act as effectually in rendering the tissues pliable.\r\n\r\nA compound microscope is necessary for the final examination of the\r\njoints of the labial and maxillary palpi (see Fig. D 2, Plate I.,\r\np. 21); but the neuration of the wing (D 1, Plate I.), another very\r\nimportant character, is easily detected with a good pocket-lens.\r\n\r\nThe works which may most usefully be consulted are, for France, M.\r\nNylander's _Formicides de France et d'Algérie_, published in vol.\r\nv. of the fourth series of the Zoological Division of the _Annales\r\ndes Sciences Naturelles_; for England, Mr. F. Smith's _Catalogue of\r\nBritish Fossorial Hymenoptera_ (1856); and for a more general review\r\nof the species in the world at large, Mr. F.

Seven years later the careful observations of the\r\nAbbé Sauvages appeared,[44] in which he gave a very good description\r\nof the nests of the \"araignée maçonne\" (_Nemesia cæmentaria_), which\r\nhe discovered near Montpellier, likening them to little rabbit\r\nburrows lined with silk and closed by a tightly-fitting moveable\r\ndoor. In 1778 and 1794 Rossi[45] published an interesting account of\r\nthe nest and habits of a trap-door spider which he had observed in\r\nCorsica and near Pisa; and from that time up to the present day the\r\ncurious dwellings of these creatures, many species of which have been\r\ndiscovered in warm climates, have continued to attract the attention\r\nof naturalists.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: P. 420, tab. 44, fig. 3 a.

(1794)).]\r\n\r\nVery little, however, has been added to our knowledge of the\r\nlife-history of these remarkable architects for several years past,\r\nand, indeed, I think it may be safely asserted that the study of the\r\nhabits and interdependence of the members of the animate world has\r\nnot, during the last fifty years, made anything like a corresponding\r\nprogress to that which may be seen in classification and description.\r\nThe microscope has led many who, a century ago, would have found\r\ntheir chief delight in observing those points in the habits and\r\nexternal characters of living creatures which the naked eye could\r\nreadily seize upon, to look much closer, to anatomize and describe in\r\ndetail every organism, great and small, and to examine every tissue\r\nand cell.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to the materials now being amassed by these modern\r\n\"cabinet naturalists\" that recourse must be had if we wish to form\r\na true comprehension of the functions and habits of living things.\r\nThey must tell us, for example, what instruments, tactile and visual,\r\nan animal possesses if we wish to understand how it constructs a\r\nparticular fabric, so that the \"field naturalist\" will have to apply\r\nto his brother of the \"cabinet\" before he can turn his observations\r\nto good account.\r\n\r\nStill, the fact remains that the habits of plants and animals afford\r\nmany openings for careful investigation, and such as are especially\r\nwithin the reach of those lovers of nature who have ample time at\r\ntheir disposal, and the opportunity to spend it in a warm climate\r\nwhere life abounds, and is never wholly checked even in the depth of\r\nwinter. It seems strange to think that collectors so frequently take\r\ncreatures out of wonderfully constructed nests and yet never observe,\r\nor at any rate never describe, the structure of these fabrics.\r\nThus, for example, the dwellings of only eight out of the thirty-six\r\nspecies of trap-door spider stated by Prof. Ausserer[46] to belong to\r\nthe Mediterranean region are known in books, those of the remaining\r\ntwenty-eight being, as far as I have been able to learn, yet to be\r\ndiscovered. This is the more strange as from the nocturnal habits\r\nof these creatures it is almost always necessary to dig them out\r\nof their nests; indeed it is more than probable that if all the\r\ndwellings which have been destroyed had been described, the following\r\npages would never have appeared.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Prof. Ausserer (Anton.), Beiträge zur Kenntniss der\r\nArachniden Familie der Territelariæ (Mygalidæ), in Verhandlungen der\r\nk.k. Zool. Bot. Gesellschaft in Wien. Jahrg. 1871, Band xxi.]\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to pass briefly in review what has been written on\r\nthe subject of trap-door spiders, it will be well to take one glance\r\nat the relation which these spiders bear to their fellows. The great\r\norder of spiders (_Araneæ_) has recently[47] been divided into seven\r\nsub-orders, the fourth of which, _Territelariæ_, includes all the\r\ntrap-door spiders, and some others which do not construct trap-doors.\r\nThis sub-order corresponds with that which was formerly called\r\n_Mygalidæ_, but this name, as well as that of _Mygale_, originally\r\ngiven to all trap-door spiders, has been abandoned because this\r\nlatter name had previously been applied to a genus of Mammals, and it\r\nwas feared that confusion might arise.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Thorell, On European Spiders, in Nova Acta Reg. Soc.\r\nScient. Upsaliensis, ser. iii. vol. vii. fasc. 1 and 2 (1869-70).]\r\n\r\nThe _Territelariæ_ [or underground weavers] are distinguished from\r\nall other spiders by the position of their falces,[48] which have\r\nthe fang directed downwards, and move vertically parallel to one\r\nanother. Thus when a victim is seized by one of the _Territelariæ_\r\nit receives a downward blow, while other spiders strike sideways,\r\nthe falces moving in a horizontal or oblique direction. With very\r\nfew exceptions this sub-order may also be known by the presence of\r\nfour blotches of paler colour at the base of the abdomen underneath,\r\nindicating the position of four air-sacs, almost all, or indeed\r\nperhaps all, other spiders having but two.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Sometimes called mandibles. One of these is\r\nrepresented, enlarged, at Fig. A 7. in Plate VII., p. 88.]\r\n\r\nCertain species of _Territelariæ_ are the only spiders known to\r\nconstruct nests closed with a door, and these creatures must be\r\nadmitted to rank among the first of Nature's handicraftsmen and\r\ninventors.\r\n\r\nThe geometrical webs of many common spiders are very beautiful\r\nstructures, but these are for the most part only snares for prey, and\r\nnot permanent dwellings, although the cocoons in which the eggs are\r\nplaced are often most ingeniously contrived. Thus in the south we\r\nmay sometimes find an inverted balloon of strong silk about an inch\r\nlong attached to heath and other bushes, which, if examined during\r\nthe winter, will be found to contain in its centre a case enclosing\r\na mass of eggs about one-third the bulk of the entire cocoon.\r\nThis inner case is shaped exactly like the outer, and both have a\r\ncircular silk lid carefully closed, and the space between the two is\r\nfilled with a dense mass of golden-brown silk, which acts no doubt\r\nas an excellent non-conductor. This cocoon is the work of _Epeira\r\nfasciata_, a species apparently only found in southern Europe.\r\n\r\nOther spiders again, such as _Theridion_,[49] suspend by a long\r\nand delicate cord of silk a minute balloon, scarcely larger than\r\na seed-pearl, containing their eggs, which sways to and fro in\r\nthe lightest breath of air. But admirable as these cocoons and\r\ngeometrical snares are, the homes of these and of spiders generally\r\ndo not exhibit much contrivance or ingenuity, or cannot at any rate\r\nbe ranked in the same category as those of the trap-door spider. But\r\nit may be asked, why should we admire the one more than the other,\r\nsince it is clear that the most squalid and mean-looking nest exactly\r\nserves the purpose of its occupant, whether for shelter or defence,\r\nand in many cases a spider might even say with truth that as for her\r\nhome it would not be so safe if it were not so dirty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: _Theridion variegatum_ (Bl.). _Ero tuberculata_, Koch.]\r\n\r\nBut the answer is simple: the trap-door spider's dwelling is to that\r\nof common spiders what the Mont Cenis tunnel is to other tunnels, and\r\nsomething besides.\r\n\r\nWhat delights us is to see how by clever contrivance and great\r\nperseverance new and multiplied difficulties have been overcome, and\r\ndangers avoided, and the interest aroused is exactly proportionate to\r\nthe amount of these difficulties and dangers.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the following pages and their accompanying\r\nillustrations will vindicate the claims of these spiders to the\r\nmarked attention and admiration which is here asserted to be their\r\ndue as architects and engineers.\r\n\r\nThere is but one British or North European representative of the\r\n_Territelariæ_--namely, _Atypus piceus_ (or _Sulzeri_),[50] and this\r\ncreature does not appear to deserve the name of trap-door spider,\r\nfor in three nests which M. H. Lucas kindly showed me, preserved at\r\nthe Jardin des Plantes at Paris, the mouth of the tube was destitute\r\nof any covering. I gathered from what I saw, and from what M. Lucas\r\ntold me, that these nests [which he had taken in the neighbourhood\r\nof Paris], consist of a silk tube from eight to ten inches long,\r\nof which about one inch only at the lower extremity penetrates the\r\nearth, the remainder being carried upwards in an irregular and\r\nsinuous course among the stems and leaves of small plants and grasses\r\nto which it is attached. When the tube is removed from these supports\r\nit collapses, and appears like a rather coarsely woven ribbon-shaped\r\nstrip of silk.[51]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Unless it should prove, as Prof. Ausserer suggests,\r\nthat the British _Atypus_ is distinct from the Continental, when it\r\nwould bear the name of _Atypus Blackwallii_. (Ausserer, l. c. p. 17).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: I have never been able to meet with an English specimen\r\nof the nest of _Atypus_; but it would appear from the descriptions\r\nthat the English differ from the French nests in being subterranean,\r\nand in having the mouth of the tube concealed by a loose flap of\r\nsilk. Mr. Blackwall says: [Spiders of Great Britain and Ireland, part\r\ni. p. 14] \"Dr. Leech has taken specimens of _Atypus Sulzeri_ in the\r\nvicinity of London and Exeter. It excavates, in humid situations, a\r\nsubterraneous gallery, which is at first horizontal, but inclines\r\ndownwards towards its termination. In this gallery it spins a tube\r\nof white silk, of a compact texture, about half inch in diameter....\r\nPart of the tube hangs outside of the aperture to protect the\r\nentrance.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to learn whether these differences\r\npermanently distinguish the English from the French nests, and if so,\r\nwhether the spiders which construct them are not, as Prof. Ausserer\r\nis inclined to believe, distinct also.]\r\n\r\nFour types of trap-door nest, properly so called, may now be\r\ndistinguished in the world at large, and these are represented\r\ndiagrammatically in the following woodcut.[52]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Where all the figures, except C 1, and D 1, which are\r\nof the natural size, are reduced to about one-third of the actual\r\nsize in large specimens.]\r\n\r\nOf these two only (A and B) were known up to the present time, the\r\nconstruction of which is much simpler than that of the two new types\r\n(C and D), which I have hitherto only found at Mentone and Cannes.[53]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: It must not be supposed that I have a sole or prior\r\nclaim to what may prove to be new and of interest in the following\r\nobservations on the Trap-door Spiders of the Riviera. This priority\r\nbelongs to the Hon. Mrs. Richard Boyle, to whom I owe it that I ever\r\ntook up the subject. It was, thanks to her guidance, that I first\r\nbecame acquainted with these marvellously-concealed nests in their\r\nnative haunts, and to her active help that I finally arrived at a\r\ncomprehension of the different types of structure which they present.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at a glance that A and B have but one door, while C\r\nand D have two, these latter having a surface door, and also another\r\ndoor a short way under ground.\r\n\r\nAll the nests consist of a tube excavated in the earth to a greater\r\nor less depth, unbranched in all but D, and in every case lined with\r\nsilk, this lining being continuous with the lining of the door or\r\ndoors of which it forms the hinge.\r\n\r\nI have found it convenient to distinguish these four types of nests\r\nby the following names:--A, the single door cork nest, or shortly\r\nthe cork nest; B, the single door wafer nest; C, the double door\r\nunbranched nest; and D, the double door branched nest.\r\n\r\nThe type B has only been found in the West India Islands, and is\r\nchiefly distinguished from A by having a thin and wafer-like door,\r\nwholly constructed of silk, without admixture of earth, lying on\r\nrather than fitting into the aperture of the tube; while in A\r\nthe door is much thicker, made of layers of earth and silk, and\r\nso contrived that it tightly closes the mouth of the tube, which\r\nis bevelled to receive it, much as a cork closes the neck of a\r\nbottle.[54]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Nests belonging to the type A, are represented in\r\nPlates VII., p. 88, and VIII., p. 94.]\r\n\r\nThe West Indian nests are of a much tougher and coarser texture than\r\nthose which I have seen in Europe, and vary somewhat in the shape of\r\ntheir tube, which is curved or straight, and sometimes has near its\r\nlower extremity a short spur-shaped enlargement, giving to the whole\r\na ludicrous resemblance to a stocking, of which this spur is the heel.\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse,[55] in his _Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica_, has given\r\nan admirable description of one of these single door wafer nests, the\r\nwork of _Cteniza nidulans_, which I cannot do better than quote:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Gosse (P. H.), Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica (1851),\r\np. 115-118. See also for another description of the same nest\r\nLatreille's Vues Générales sur les Araneides, in the Nouv. Ann. du\r\nMuséum (Paris, 1832), tom. i. p. 73-4.]\r\n\r\nThe nest is \"cylindrical, or nearly so, from four to ten inches deep,\r\nand about one inch in diameter; the bottom is rounded; and the top,\r\nwhich is at the surface of the soil, is closed very accurately with\r\na circular lid. They are not all equally finished, some being much\r\nmore compact, and having the lid more closely fitted than others.\r\nSome have irregular bulgings, and ragged laminated offsets on the\r\nouter surface; but all are smooth and silky on the inside.... The\r\nmouth of the tube, and the parts near it, are very strong; the walls\r\nhere often having a thickness of from one-eighth to one-fourth of an\r\ninch; but the lower parts are much thinner. The lid is continuous\r\nwith the tube for about a third of its circumference, and this part\r\nmay be called the hinge, though it presents no structure peculiar to\r\nitself; it is simply bent at a right angle, as is manifest, if a nest\r\nbe cut longitudinally through with scissors, the incision passing\r\nthrough the midst of the lid. The mode of construction, I judge, from\r\nexamination of many nests, to be this. The spider digs a cylindrical\r\nhole in the moist earth, with her jointed fangs or mandibles,\r\ncarrying out the fragments as they are dislodged. When the excavation\r\nhas proceeded a little way, she begins to spin the lining which\r\nforms the dwelling. I conclude thus, because nests are occasionally\r\nfound a few inches in length, with the lid and upper part perfect,\r\nbut without any bottom, these being evidently in the course of\r\nformation. I suppose that she weaves her silk at first in unconnected\r\npatches, against the earthy sides, perhaps where the mould is liable\r\nto fall in; and thus I account for the loose rough laminæ of silk\r\nthat are always found projecting from the outer surface. These are\r\noverlaid with other patches more and more extensive, until the whole\r\ninterior walls are covered; after which the silk is spun evenly and\r\ncontinuously all round the interior, in successive layers of very\r\ndense texture, though thin. Under the microscope, with a power of 220\r\ndiameters, these layers are resolved into threads laid across each\r\nother and intertwined in a very irregular manner; some are simple,\r\nvarying from 1/7000 to 1/2000 of an inch in diameter, and others are\r\ncompound, several threads, in one part separate, being united into\r\none of greater thickness which cannot then be resolved.... The mouth\r\nof the tube is commonly dilated a little, so as to form a slightly\r\nrecurved brim or lip; and the lid is sometimes a little convex\r\ninternally, so as to fall more accurately into the mouth and close it.\r\n\r\n\"The thickening of the hinge by additional layers is, I think,\r\naccidental only, as, out of the many specimens that I have examined,\r\nonly one or two had such a structure. In the neatest examples, the\r\nlid is of equal thickness throughout its extent, agreeing also with\r\nthe walls for the first few inches of their depth.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse says that he possesses one specimen of peculiar\r\ncompactness, which differs from all the others that he has examined\r\nin having \"a row of minute holes, such as might be made by a very\r\nfine needle, pierced around the free edge of the lid, and a double\r\nrow of similar ones just within the margin of the tube. There are\r\nabout fifteen or sixteen punctures in each series, and they penetrate\r\nthrough the whole substance, the light being clearly seen through\r\neach hole. I do not think, as I have somewhere seen suggested, that\r\nthey are intended to afford a hold for the spider's claws when she\r\nwould keep her door shut against the efforts of an enemy, for what\r\nwould be the use of having them in the tube _close to the lid_, so\r\nclose that not the eighth of an inch intervenes between the surface\r\nof the lid and that of the tube, when the former is tightly closed? I\r\nwould suggest whether they may not be air-holes, for so tight is the\r\nfitting of the lid, and so compact the texture of the material, that\r\nI should suppose the interior would be impermeable to air but for\r\nthis contrivance.\"[56] \"The spider that inhabits this nest is black,\r\nwith the thorax of an exceedingly lustrous polish, its abdomen is\r\nfull and round, its legs very short.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: I cannot myself think this explanation probable, and\r\nshould still be inclined to consider these punctures to be the claw\r\nmarks of the spider, as is the case in some European nests.]\r\n\r\nAnother form of this single door wafer nest is described by Mr.\r\nSells,[57] in which there is a hinge-like thickening of the silk\r\nlining of the tube about an inch below the actual hinge of the door,\r\nwhich it is suggested may serve to give additional elasticity.\r\nThis was not found, however, in all the nests examined, and Mr.\r\nSells conjectures that in newly constructed nests the lid may close\r\nsufficiently firmly without this contrivance, and that it is only\r\nadded in older nests.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Mr. W. Sells. Notes respecting the Nest of _Cteniza\r\nnidulans_, in Trans. Ent. Soc. ii. 207-210.]\r\n\r\nPatrick Browne's figure, to which reference has been made above,\r\nrepresents a nest with two doors, one applied against the other, at\r\nthe mouth of the tube, and it has often been asked what this could\r\npossibly mean.\r\n\r\nSome have thought that the drawing was fanciful, others that it was\r\nmade from an abnormal or injured nest. However, I believe that the\r\ndrawing, though rude, is, in fact, not very incorrect, and shows a\r\ncase of repair or enlargement of the nest, a subject to be treated of\r\nmore fully further on. There is a specimen exhibited in the British\r\nMuseum which in this respect very nearly corresponds with Browne's\r\nfigure; it is labelled \"Nest of Trap-door Spider with two doors,\r\nfrom the spider having enlarged its abode.--Jamaica.\" Here one sees\r\nthat the spider has prolonged its tube about half an inch beyond the\r\noriginal mouth of the nest, where it has constructed a new mouth and\r\ndoor, the old door standing straight up at the back of and behind the\r\nnew one.\r\n\r\nI imagine that the explanation of this curious piece of cobbling may\r\nbe somewhat as follows:--When the nest was in its original state and\r\nhad but one door, this door became by some accident covered over with\r\nearth to about the depth of half an inch, and the inmate was thus\r\nimprisoned. Then the spider, being, like most other members of its\r\norder, very unwilling to abandon its home, determined to clear away\r\nthe entrance to its nest, and to lengthen the tube so that it should\r\nreach up to the new level of the surface of the earth.... If I am\r\nright, this should rather be called a lengthening than an enlargement\r\nof the tube.\r\n\r\nThe nests of the cork type (A, p. 79) may usually be distinguished\r\nat a glance from those of the wafer type by the greater thickness\r\nof the door, and by its manner of shutting, but a nest from Morocco\r\nhas been figured and described by Prof. Westwood,[58] which seems\r\nintermediate between the two. The door in this case may perhaps be\r\nconsidered as of the cork type, though it is very thin, for it does\r\nfit into the mouth of the tube, which is bevelled to receive it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Observations on the Species of Trap-door Spiders, in\r\nTrans. of Entomological Soc., London, 1841-3, vol. iii. p. 175.\r\n\r\nI wish to take the present opportunity of thanking Prof. Westwood for\r\nhaving afforded me special facilities for examining this and other\r\nspecimens forming part of the very valuable collections under his\r\ncare at Oxford.]\r\n\r\nThese nests were forwarded with their living occupants (_Cteniza\r\n[Actinopus] ædificatorius_) from Tangiers to Prof. Westwood, who\r\ndescribes the nests as being \"about four inches deep, slightly curved\r\nwithin, about three quarters of an inch in diameter, the valve at the\r\nmouth not being circular, but rather of an oval form, one side where\r\nthe hinge is placed being straighter than the other. The valve is\r\nformed of a number of layers of coarse silk, in the upper layers of\r\nwhich are imbedded particles of the earth, so as to give the cover\r\nthe exact appearance of the surrounding soil, the several successive\r\nlayers causing it, when more closely inspected, to resemble a small\r\nflattened oyster-shell.\"\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between this nest and that of the West Indian species\r\nis the more interesting as Prof. Westwood says that both belong to\r\nthe same genus, (_Cteniza_ or _Actinopus_ of different authors,)\r\nand are so closely allied as to present scarcely any important\r\ndistinction but that of size.\r\n\r\nWe shall find, however, on comparing the nests of these trap-door\r\nspiders and their occupants, that we cannot as yet make any rule as\r\nto the kind of nest which we may expect from a given spider.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that species belonging to the same genus, and closely\r\nresembling one another, sometimes build dissimilar nests; while\r\nothers, belonging to different genera, and unlike in many important\r\nrespects, construct almost identical nests.\r\n\r\nThis is the more strange, because, if we examine the structure of the\r\nclaws and palpi, they often seem to be specially adapted to serve as\r\ncarding instruments and to play a very important part in the weaving\r\nof the silk linings of the nest; and yet nests of the same type are\r\noccasionally produced by spiders in which these appendages are quite\r\nunlike, and dissimilar nests where the claws and palpi are to all\r\nappearance identical.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, if the reader will examine the drawings of part\r\nof the foremost right foot of _Cteniza fodiens_, figs. A, 9 and 10,\r\nPlate VII., p. 88, with that of _Nemesia cæmentaria_, figs. A, 9 and\r\n10, Plate VIII., p. 94, both of which make nests of the cork type,\r\nhe will see that in the former the last joint of the tarsus is armed\r\nalong the inner side, with many moveable spines, and that each of the\r\ntwo curved terminal claws has only one very strong tooth near the\r\nbase; while the same joint of the latter (_N. cæmentaria_) has no\r\nspines, and the claws have three minute comb-like teeth near the base.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the reverse case, where the structure of the\r\nsame joint is very similar, the nests may be wholly unlike, as in\r\n_Nemesia Eleanora_, Plate XII., p. 106, and _N. cæmentaria_, Plate\r\nVIII., where the nest of the former is of the double-door unbranched\r\ntype, and that of the latter of the single-door cork type.\r\n\r\nIt is probable however that a fuller and closer comparison of, and a\r\nmore exact acquaintance with the several parts and their functions\r\nmight show us that all spiders which spin similar webs are furnished\r\nwith equivalent instruments, so that what one leg lacks another may\r\npossess in some shape or another; brushes of stiff hairs in one\r\nplace, compensating for a toothed claw, or for a row of moveable\r\nspines in another.[59]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: The claws are probably of first-rate importance in this\r\nrespect and should be most carefully studied. M. Lucas has stated\r\nthat the claws of _Mygale Blondii_, and _M. nigra_ from Algiers, and\r\nof _M. nigra_ and _M. avicularia_ from Brazil, are retractile like\r\nthose of a cat! Unfortunately the dwellings of these spiders have\r\nnot been described. See Lucas (H.) in Rev. et Mag. de Zoologie, sér.\r\n2, tom. ix. 1857, p. 587, and Ann. de la Soc. Entom. de France, ser.\r\n3, tom. v. p. cxx., and vi. p. clxxi. Another curious point in which\r\nspiders differ is the presence or absence of viscidity in the hairs\r\nwhich clothe their feet and palpi. Mr. Blackwall states (Spiders of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland, vol. i. p. 13), that by far the greater\r\nnumber of the sub-order _Territelariæ_, or _Mygalidæ_ as he terms\r\nthem, \"have the inferior surface of their biungulate tarsi, and of\r\nthe digital joint of their pediform palpi, in the females, densely\r\nclothed with compound, hair-like papillæ, constituting an apparatus\r\nwhich, by the emission of a viscous secretion, enables them to\r\ntraverse the perpendicular surfaces of dry, highly polished bodies;\r\nothers have three pairs of spinners and are destitute of hair-like\r\npapillæ on the legs and palpi.\"\r\n\r\nThe four species of trap-door spider on the Riviera, here described,\r\nappear to form exceptions to this rule, however, for they all\r\nremained helpless prisoners when placed in a glass tumbler, though\r\nstruggling vigorously for freedom.\r\n\r\nWhen, however relying on this experience, I placed a number of\r\nsmaller spiders of different kinds in glasses for examination some\r\nwalked straight out without any difficulty, while others were unable\r\nto climb up the sides.]\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting, from this point of view, to draw all the\r\nparts which may be supposed to aid in the act of weaving, and so to\r\ncontrast the corresponding limbs of different spiders, the nests of\r\nwhich are known, that one might see at a glance in what they differed\r\nand agreed. I have done this for the falces and the last joint of\r\nthe foremost right foot of the four spiders figured in Plates VII.,\r\nVIII., IX., and XII., but to make the case complete all the limbs\r\nshould be represented in the same way.\r\n\r\nOf the two spiders which are shown with their cork nests in Plates\r\nVII. and VIII., the purplish grey _Cteniza fodiens_, (Plate VII.)\r\nappears to be much rarer than the brown striped _Nemesia cæmentaria_\r\n(VIII.), at any rate at Mentone. I have hitherto only succeeded\r\nin obtaining four specimens of the former, though I have searched\r\nrepeatedly for them at Cannes and Mentone, while the latter species\r\nis tolerably common.\r\n\r\nThe nests are, however, often extremely hard to find, and in some\r\ncases it is only by chance that I have been able to light upon them.\r\nAll these trap-door spiders seem usually to prefer rather moist\r\nand shady places, and sloping banks or loose terrace walls where\r\nthe interstices between the stones are filled up with earth, and\r\nconcealment is afforded by the creeping lycopodium (_Selaginella\r\ndenticulata_), Ceterach, spleen-wort or maiden-hair ferns, with short\r\nmoss and splashes of white lichen to distract the eye.\r\n\r\nIt was from such a terrace wall at Mentone, on March 26, 1872, that\r\nthe nest A in Plate VII. was taken, the tube running obliquely back\r\ninto the earth between the stones, and the door being concealed by a\r\nnet-work of lycopodium, one spray of which had been allowed to grow\r\non its upper surface.\r\n\r\nThe tubes of these as of the other kinds of nest are sometimes\r\nstraight, but more frequently they are bent, and almost always take a\r\ndownward course.\r\n\r\nThe following is Mr. Pickard-Cambridge's description[60] of _Cteniza\r\nfodiens_, the spider which constructs this nest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: The following description and remarks, printed in a\r\ndifferent type, have been kindly prepared for this work by the Rev.\r\nO. Pickard-Cambridge, to whom I sent a series of specimens of the\r\nspiders preserved in spirit of wine and their nests. My very sincere\r\nthanks are due to Mr. Pickard-Cambridge for this assistance, which\r\nwill give to my publication a value in the eyes of Arachnologists\r\nwhich it could not otherwise have possessed. To all those who wish\r\nto study the true structural relations of the four spiders, the\r\nhabits of which are recorded in the following pages, these details\r\nwill prove of the highest importance; while those who are only\r\ninterested in the economy of these creatures can readily pass them\r\nover. For observers in the field there is a very ready way of knowing\r\nthese four spiders apart, as it will be seen that when they are\r\nsomewhat alike the nests are different (_Nemesia meridionalis_ and\r\n_N. Eleanora_), and when the nests are alike (_Cteniza fodiens_ and\r\n_Nemesia cæmentaria_) the spiders are markedly dissimilar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate VI._]\r\n\r\n                         FAM.

Sauvagei_, Ausserer, _Beiträge zur Kenntniss der Arachniden\r\n  Familie der Territelariæ (Thor.)_, p. 36.\r\n\r\n  Female adult length 10 lines.\r\n\r\n  _Cephalothorax_ oblong oval, somewhat truncate at each end, and of\r\n  a dull whitish-yellow brown colour, the normal grooves and furrows\r\n  are strongly marked, the caput is large and elevated, rounded on\r\n  the sides and slightly higher near the occiput than at the ocular\r\n  area, the junction of the thoracic segments is indicated by a\r\n  strong deep curved indentation, the curve directed backwards;\r\n  there are a few strong black bristles of different lengths within\r\n  the ocular space, and several others run backwards in the central\r\n  line to the occiput. The height of the Clypeus is equal to rather\r\n  more than the diameter of one of the foremost eyes. The _Eyes_ are\r\n  eight, and form a rectangular figure whose transverse diameter\r\n  is the longest, and whose fore side is a little shorter than\r\n  the hinder one; the longitudinal diameter is about equal to the\r\n  space between the two foremost eyes; these are the largest of the\r\n  eight, and are separated by an interval of very nearly two eyes'\r\n  diameters; the two central eyes are the smallest, and are distant\r\n  from each other just about one eye's diameter, the eyes of the\r\n  hinder row are in two pairs forming the hinder corners of the\r\n  rectangle, those of each pair are nearly contiguous to each other,\r\n  and the inner one of each is the smallest; these last in the figure\r\n  appear to be the smallest of the eight, but this arises from the\r\n  point of view whence the figure was drawn; the two central eyes\r\n  occupy as nearly as possible the centre of the figure formed by the\r\n  two foremost eyes, and the two inner ones of the hinder row, and\r\n  are seated on a large black spot. The _Legs_ are short, strong,\r\n  and similar to the Cephalothorax in colour, their relative length\r\n  appeared to be 4, 3, 1, 2, they are furnished with hairs, bristles,\r\n  and short strong spines. These latter are on those of the two first\r\n  pairs, situated chiefly in two longitudinal parallel rows beneath\r\n  the tibiæ, metatarsi, and tarsi; on those of the third pair they\r\n  are situated on the sides and upper sides of those joints, while\r\n  the fourth pair has them only beneath the metatarsi and tarsi; all\r\n  the tarsi terminate with three claws, the two superior ones are\r\n  much the longest and strongest, and have a single short strong\r\n  tooth inside near the base. Near the union of the femora and genuæ\r\n  of the legs of the fourth pair are numerous short strong spines,\r\n  hairs, and bristles. The _Palpi_ are similar in colour to the\r\n  legs; they are strong and about equal in length to the legs of the\r\n  second pair, and have a double longitudinal row of strong spines\r\n  widely separated and divergent from each other beneath them; the\r\n  digital joint (like the tarsi of the legs) is furnished with other\r\n  spines between these two rows; each palpus terminates with a single\r\n  untoothed curved claw. The _Falces_ are strong, prominent, rounded\r\n  in the profile line, and have some hairs, bristles, and spines near\r\n  their fore extremities; the longest and strongest of the spines\r\n  are three in number, and form a kind of transverse row or comb at\r\n  the extreme inner point on the upper side of each falx; besides\r\n  these there is a row of short tooth-like spines on either margin of\r\n  the furrow on the under side of each falx in which the fang lies\r\n  concealed when at rest. The _Maxillæ_ are short and strong; the\r\n  palpi issue from their extremity on the outer side, and the inner\r\n  extremity is somewhat prominent and pointed.\r\n\r\n  The _Labium_ is small, short, somewhat rectangular in form, and\r\n  broader than high; the apex is a little rounded, and furnished with\r\n  a single transverse row of small tooth-like spines.\r\n\r\n  The _Sternum_ is somewhat subtriangular in form, much broader\r\n  behind, where it is rounded on the outer angles.\r\n\r\n  The _Abdomen_ is short oval, very convex above, where it is of a\r\n  yellowish vinous brown colour, with a slightly darker longitudinal\r\n  tapering, indistinct central stripe on the fore part; it is\r\n  sparingly clothed with hairs, and the under side is of a pale dull\r\n  yellowish colour; the spinners are four in number, and those of the\r\n  superior pair are the strongest, three jointed and upturned.\r\n\r\n  Adults and immature examples (all females) were found in tubular\r\n  holes lined with silk and closed at the orifice with a strong solid\r\n  hinged lid, shutting into the opening like a cork.\r\n\r\nThe portions of nests at B and C in Plate VII. also belong to\r\n_Cteniza fodiens_, the latter being very similar to A in its\r\nsurroundings, but having a rather thinner door, slightly hollowed out\r\nabove (C 1). The smaller nest shown shut at B and open at B 1,[61]\r\nis admirably concealed by mosses and lichens, some of which actually\r\ngrow upon the door, and here two minute trap-doors, belonging\r\nto infantine examples of a distinct species of spider (_Nemesia\r\nmeridionalis_), are seen on the left hand below.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: It must be clearly understood that when the doors are\r\nrepresented as standing open or ajar this is unnatural, as they\r\nalways close by their own combined weight and elasticity.]\r\n\r\nIt is not rare to find small colonies of nests of the same or\r\ndistinct species grouped closely together in this way, though I\r\ngreatly doubt whether one can safely assume their sociability from\r\nthis fact.\r\n\r\nI have very seldom seen nests on the flat ground, where the door\r\nwould lie horizontally when closed, a sloping or nearly vertical bank\r\nbeing usually chosen, where the door will fall to by its own weight.\r\n\r\nIn the Ionian Islands another species or variety of _Cteniza_,\r\ndescribed under the name of _Cteniza (or Mygale) ionica_, and\r\nrepresented as being of an uniform yellow-brown colour, is said to\r\nmake its nests in the earth of the terraces round the roots of the\r\nolive trees.\r\n\r\nMr. Saunders[62] gives admirable figures and descriptions which show\r\nus at once that these nests, which he discovered in rather elevated\r\nsituations in the island of Zante, are of the cork type; but, in\r\nthis case, the entire door does not shut flush with the surface, as\r\nin ordinary cork nests, but has a short spur-like projection above\r\nand behind the hinge, serving, as is conjectured, like a lever, by\r\npressing on which from the outside the lid may easily be raised.[63]\r\nWhen I come to speak of the manner of constructing and repairing\r\nnests I shall have occasion to refer to these nests again.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Sydney Smith Saunders. Description of a Species of\r\nMygale from Ionia, in Trans. Ent. Soc. London, 1839, vol. iii. p.\r\n160, Plate IX.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: I must own to some hesitation about accepting this\r\nexplanation, though I am not prepared to offer any other.]\r\n\r\nI have not as yet found any nests on the Riviera which can be said to\r\ncorrespond accurately with those of _Ct. ionica_, the only builders\r\nof cork nests yet discovered in this district being _Cteniza fodiens_\r\nand _Nemesia cæmentaria_.\r\n\r\nThis latter species is described by Mr. Pickard-Cambridge,[64] in the\r\nfollowing terms:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: See above, p. 88.]\r\n\r\n                       Gen. Nemesia (Savigny).\r\n\r\n  Nemesia cæmentaria. Plate IX.\r\n\r\n  Syn. _Mygale cæmentaria_ (Latr.), _H. N. des Crust._ t. vii. p. 164.\r\n\r\n  _M. cæmentaria_ (Walck), _Ins. Apt._ i. p. 135.\r\n\r\n  Female adult, length 9 to 11 lines.\r\n\r\n  _Cephalothorax_ rather elongate, oval, and somewhat truncated at\r\n  each extremity; the caput is elevated and rounded on the sides and\r\n  upper part, but less elevated than in _Cteniza_; the normal grooves\r\n  and indentations are well marked, and the junction of the cephalic\r\n  and thoracic segments is indicated by a strong deep impression or\r\n  cleft, of a transverse, curved, or somewhat bent angular form, the\r\n  curve or angle directed forwards. The colour of the cephalothorax\r\n  is yellow-brown tinged with olive, the margins are paler, but\r\n  have no distinctly defined marginal band. On the hinder part of\r\n  the caput are three clear brown-yellow longitudinal stripes; the\r\n  central one reaches from behind the two hind central eyes to the\r\n  thoracic junction, the lateral ones converge a little to the same\r\n  point, but do not reach nearly, in fact not much more than half\r\n  way, to the eyes. The clypeus is of a clear brown-yellow colour\r\n  also, and on either side of it (extending from each fore lateral\r\n  eye), is an irregular patch of the same. The ocular region and\r\n  clypeus are furnished with a few strongish black bristles, and the\r\n  three yellow stripes above mentioned have a few more, those on the\r\n  central stripe being the longest and strongest, and disposed in a\r\n  single longitudinal row.\r\n\r\n  The _Eyes_, eight in number, are seated on a transverse oval\r\n  eminence, and form a rectangular figure, whose transverse diameter\r\n  is double the length of its longitudinal diameter: their relative\r\n  position is similar to that of _Cteniza_, but in the present\r\n  species they are smaller than in _C. fodiens_: those of the hind\r\n  central pair are the smallest of the eight, and each is very\r\n  nearly contiguous to the hind lateral on its side; the interval\r\n  between those of each lateral pair is small; the space between\r\n  the two central eyes of the eight is equal to an eye's diameter,\r\n  and each of these is separated from the hind central and fore\r\n  lateral nearest to it by a similar interval. The _Legs_ are strong,\r\n  moderately long, their relative length 4, 1, 3, 2?, but little\r\n  difference is observable between 1, 3, and 2; they are furnished\r\n  with hairs, bristles, and a few, not very strong, spines; each\r\n  tarsus terminates with three curved claws, the two superior ones\r\n  much the longest and strongest, and have a few small teeth near\r\n  their base inside.\r\n\r\n  The _Palpi_ are strong and similar in colour and armature to the\r\n  legs; each is terminated with a curved black claw.\r\n\r\n  _Falces_ strong, prominent, and rounded in the profile line;\r\n  they are furnished with hairs, bristles, and strong tooth-like\r\n  spines; the four strongest of these latter form a transverse row\r\n  at the inner extremity of each; besides these there is a row of\r\n  short tooth-like spines on the inner margin of the furrow on the\r\n  underside of each falx, in which the fang lies concealed when at\r\n  rest. The _Maxillæ_ are strong, with a small angular prominence at\r\n  their inner extremities (when looked at from beneath), and each\r\n  has three to four small dark-coloured teeth in a short, straight,\r\n  obliquely transverse row at the base on the inner side. _Labium_\r\n  broad but short, its breadth is double its height, and the upper\r\n  corners are rounded off. The _Sternum_ is of a somewhat pentagonal\r\n  form.\r\n\r\n  _Abdomen_ rather elongate oval, tolerably, but not excessively,\r\n  convex above; it is of a dull yellowish whitey-brown colour marked\r\n  and mottled above with dark chestnut brown; the markings are rather\r\n  irregular, but a general disposition in the form of a longitudinal\r\n  central, and oblique lateral, stripes or bars may be traced on the\r\n  hinder half; the superior spinners are short and three-jointed,\r\n  those of the inferior pair are exceedingly minute.\r\n\r\n  Adult females were found in nests similar to those of _Cteniza\r\n  fodiens_.\r\n\r\nThe cork nests are the simplest form of nest, with the exception of\r\nthose described above from Jamaica, and have constituted, up to the\r\npresent time, the only type known in Europe. Their chief claims to\r\nour admiration lie in the perfection of workmanship which the doors\r\nusually exhibit, and the marvellous concealment which they afford\r\nwhen closed. These doors as a rule fit so tightly [thanks to the\r\naccurate adjustment of their sloping sides to the bevelled lip of\r\nthe tube which receives them,] that they afford a certain amount\r\nof mechanical resistance, even when the spider is away. But, after\r\nexamining a very large series of these cork nests, I find that there\r\nis some variation in the degree of perfection attained in their work\r\nby different individuals of the same kind. The mechanical resistance\r\nis greater or less in proportion to the thickness and weight of the\r\ndoor, and to the slope of its sides, and of the bevelled edges of\r\nthe tube; and in each of these details a marked difference may be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nOne might suppose from what has so often been repeated as to the\r\nhabits of _N. cæmentaria_, that, whenever any one attempts to open\r\nthe door, the spider, which is always at home in the day time, would\r\ndart up from the bottom of the tube and endeavour to keep it closed\r\nby holding on from within.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate VIII._]\r\n\r\nI cannot say what may take place during the summer months; but from\r\nOctober to May I have but rarely found one of these spiders ready to\r\noppose me, though _Nemesia meridionalis_ and _N. Eleanora_ frequently\r\ndid so. Many times, wishing to provoke them, I have tapped at the\r\ndoor in order to apprise the occupant of my arrival, or lifted it and\r\nlet it fall again, and always in vain, though the spider was there,\r\ncrouching at the bottom of her tube.\r\n\r\nIndeed I can only recall six or eight instances in which this spider\r\ndid hold down her door, and on three of these she was captured.\r\n\r\nI will now relate what I saw on one of these occasions,[65] for there\r\nhas been much speculation as to the manner in which the spider clings\r\nto the door and offers the determined resistance which is experienced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Mrs. Boyle was the first to witness this curious sight,\r\nand my description of the resistance of the spider is almost an exact\r\nrepetition of hers to me. It is curious also that, following her\r\nindications, I found the very nest and spider on which she had made\r\nher observations, and every detail recurred again though several days\r\nhad elapsed between her visit and mine.]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had I gently touched the door with the point of a penknife\r\nthan it was drawn slowly downwards, with a movement which reminded\r\nme of the tightening of a limpet on a sea-rock, so that the crown\r\nwhich at first projected a little way above, finally lay a little\r\nbelow the surface of the soil. I then contrived to raise the door\r\nvery gradually, despite the strenuous efforts of the occupant, till\r\nat length I was just able to see into the nest, and to distinguish\r\nthe spider holding on to the door with all her might, lying back\r\ndownwards, with her fangs and all her claws driven into the silk\r\nlining of the under surface of the door. The body of the spider was\r\nplaced across, and filled up, the tube, the head being away from\r\nthe hinge, and she obtained an additional purchase in this way by\r\nblocking up the entrance.\r\n\r\nI did not force the spider to release her hold, but, by a rapid\r\nstroke with a long-bladed knife, cut out the upper part of the tube\r\nwith the surrounding mass of soil, and thus secured the trap-door and\r\nits owner. This specimen is represented at fig. C, Plate VIII., where\r\nthe pin-point holes made by the claws may be seen in pairs round the\r\nwhole circumference of the flatter portion of the lower surface of\r\nthe door except on the side next to the hinge.\r\n\r\nWhenever a spider resists in this way she must make these holes, but\r\nI have very rarely seen them in other nests; this may perhaps be\r\naccounted for by their having been effaced by the action of moisture\r\nwhich would stretch the silk. However this may be, this specimen\r\nshowed the claw marks quite distinctly on my return to England after\r\nthe lapse of several weeks.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written about these marks, which are frequently spoken\r\nof as holes purposely made in the silk in order to give the spider a\r\nbetter purchase. It has also been stated that two holes may be seen\r\nin the silk of the tube near the mouth on the side away from the\r\nhinge, but these I have never been able to find. The door of nest A\r\nin Plate VIII. is rather abnormal, as it is made up of two doors, the\r\nsmaller one being spun into the top of the one now in use. This is,\r\nI believe, an abnormal and rather clumsy example of the ordinary way\r\nof enlarging the nest, but of this we shall see more when we come to\r\nspeak of the construction and repairing of these nests generally.\r\n\r\nFig. B in this plate represents a moss-covered sod pierced by the\r\ntube of a nest, the door of which is entirely concealed from view,\r\nand only discovered when opened as at B 1.\r\n\r\nThis nest was found accidentally by Mr. Robert Lightbody, who\r\nkindly brought it to me, its presence having been betrayed by the\r\ntube, which he happened to cut through in digging up a plant. The\r\nmoss on the door grew as vigorously, and had in every way the same\r\nappearance, as that which was rooted in the surrounding earth; and so\r\nperfect was the deception that I found it impossible to detect the\r\nposition of the closed trap even when holding it in my hand. There\r\ncan be no doubt that many nests escape observation in this way, and\r\nthe artifice is the more surprising because there is strong reason to\r\nbelieve that this beautiful door-garden is deliberately planted with\r\nmoss by the spider, and not the effect of a mere chance growth. I\r\nshall adduce evidence in support of this statement by-and-by.\r\n\r\nI alluded to the nest C (Plate VIII.) when speaking of the claw\r\nmarks which it exhibits, and that figured at D and D 1 in this plate\r\nis merely an instance of a good example of this type. I have taken\r\nnests of _N. cæmentaria_ both at Cannes and Mentone, and have little\r\ndoubt that this species will be discovered at many points along the\r\nRiviera. I detected two abandoned nests of the cork type, which I\r\nfully expect had belonged to _N. cæmentaria_, in an enclosed space\r\ncalled the Campagne de Garonne in Marseilles itself. These nests lay\r\nin the little mound of undisturbed earth between the divided trunks\r\nof the small olive-trees, and I do not doubt that if I had had time\r\nto search I should have discovered more nests, and perhaps others\r\nwhich were still tenanted.\r\n\r\nWe now turn from the single-door nests to those with double doors,\r\nand from the well known to the new types of structure.\r\n\r\nIn these we have a thin and wafer-like door at the mouth of the\r\nnest, and from two to four inches lower down, a second and solid\r\nunderground door. These lower doors are characteristic of the\r\nnests to which they belong, that of the branched nest (_Nemesia\r\nmeridionalis_, Plate IX.) being long and more or less tongue-shaped,\r\nwhile that of the unbranched double-door nest (_N. Eleanora_, Plate\r\nXII. p. 106) is somewhat horse-shoe shaped.\r\n\r\nThe surface doors of these two kinds of nest do not appear to\r\ndiffer, and, though rather thinner, may be compared to those of the\r\nsingle-door wafer kind from Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThe commonest form at Mentone is the branched nest, which may be\r\nfound in abundance in many of the loosely-built walls of the lemon\r\nand olive terraces or on sloping banks, but they are rarely to be met\r\nwith on flat ground.\r\n\r\nIn the nests of _Nemesia meridionalis_ the tube, instead of being\r\nsimple, as it is in all other known nests, is invariably branched,\r\na second tube joining the first at the point where the lower door\r\nis hung and forming with it an angle of about 45°. The main tube\r\ndescends and is frequently curved, or sometimes doubly bent like the\r\nspout of a tea-kettle (A, Plate X. p. 100), while the branch ascends,\r\nand in some few instances reaches the surface, though it is usually a\r\n_cul de sac_ (Plate IX.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate IX._]\r\n\r\nIn the exceptional cases where the nests have two superficial\r\nopenings, one of the two surface doors always appears neglected and\r\ngoing to decay, or is covered with earth which chokes the upper part\r\nof its tube. The explanation of this probably is that the spider\r\nfound the original entrance blocked up or in some way unfitted for\r\nuse, and then prolonged what was the blind branch until it reached\r\nthe surface and replaced the former doorway. However this may be it\r\nis certain that in the great majority of nests it will be found that\r\nthe branch ends in the earth, and is a _cul de sac_, and this I have\r\ninvariably observed to be the case in the nests of very young spiders\r\nof this species (fig. B, Plate IX.)\r\n\r\nThe tube is frequently enlarged at the mouth, and forms a spreading\r\nlip which the surface door is usually large enough to cover (A 1,\r\nPlate IX.)\r\n\r\nIn these branched double-door nests the upper door does not fit into,\r\nbut merely lies upon, the mouth of the tube, the elasticity of the\r\nhinge and its own weight being sufficient to keep it closed. The\r\nlower door is suspended by a hinge placed at the apex of the angle\r\nformed by the bifurcation of the tube, and is hung in such a manner\r\nthat it can either be pushed upwards so as to lie diagonally across\r\nand block the main tube, or be drawn back so as to fit into and close\r\nthe entrance to the branch.\r\n\r\nThis will, I think, best be understood by reference to the drawings\r\nof a small nest of this type given at B 1 and B 2 in Plate XI. p.\r\n105, where the second door is shown in its two positions. This lower\r\ndoor is from 1 to 1-1/2 lines thick, channeled above, but nearly\r\nflat on the back, and of an elliptic form, with a loose appendage\r\nat its lower end, the whole being made of earth enclosed in a case\r\nof silk.[66] When the lower door is drawn back so as to close and\r\nconceal the entrance to the branch, it lies in the same plane, and\r\nclosely corresponds in curvature with the lining of the main tube and\r\nalmost appears to form part of it (fig. A, Plate X. p. 100, and fig.\r\nB 1, Plate XI. p. 105).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: Since writing the above I have learned, thanks to a\r\nbetter method which I have recently adopted for preserving the nests\r\nfor examination, that sometimes the lower door, instead of being free\r\nwithin the tube and only attached to the lining by the hinge, is\r\nsurrounded on either side by a delicate silk web, which extends from\r\neither edge of its lower surface to the silk walls of the tube below\r\nand forms a sort of double gusset. This admits of the movement of the\r\nlower door in the way described above, but perhaps serves, together\r\nwith the solid appendage at the extremity of the free end of the door\r\n(that away from the hinge), to prevent the door from being driven too\r\nfar in an upward direction and thus becoming so tightly jammed as to\r\nmake the spider a prisoner in her own nest. I think it possible that\r\nthe lower door is always attached to the tube in this way, but, as\r\nit parts readily from the silk on either side when the earth which\r\nsupports the tube is removed, it very frequently appears to be free,\r\nas I have represented it in Plates IX., X., and XI.]\r\n\r\nWhen digging out these nests, after carefully removing the upper\r\nportion, I have frequently seen the lower door move across and block\r\nup the main tube in a mysterious manner, it being in reality pushed\r\nby the spider from below, and she may sometimes be captured at her\r\npost with her back set against the door. More frequently, when the\r\nspider finds that resistance is hopeless and sees the earth crumbling\r\nin, she drops to the bottom of her nest and lies there helpless, with\r\nher legs folded against her body like an embryonic creature; some,\r\nhowever, more savage than their neighbours, fly out and strike at the\r\nintruder with their fangs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate X._]\r\n\r\nWhat then, it may be asked, is the use of the branch? I do not think\r\nthat we can draw any safe conclusion from what takes place when we\r\ndig out a spider, as to what would occur if she were besieged by one\r\nof her natural enemies, such as ichneumons, sand-wasps, centipedes\r\n(_Scolopendra_), small lizards &c.[67]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: For some account of the principal enemies of spiders\r\ngenerally, see p. 134.]\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, however, that one of these creatures has found\r\nits way into the nest and is crawling down the tube. What will\r\nprobably happen? Why, in the first place, the spider will slam the\r\nsecond door in the face of the intruder, and then, if worsted in\r\nthe pushing match which follows, quickly draw this door back again\r\nand run up into the safety branch, when the enemy, after descending\r\nprecipitately to the bottom of the main tube, will look in vain for\r\nthe spider as it searches on its way up for the secret passage now\r\nclosed by its trap-door. This is but a purely imaginary case, and it\r\nmay be that the branch has some wholly different purpose.\r\n\r\nIt seems very improbable, however, that it should be mainly intended\r\nas a safety place for the eggs or offspring; at least if this were\r\nthe case we should not expect to find it, as we do, in the nests of\r\nvery young spiders (fig. B, Plate IX.), which could have no use for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe large spider and its nest figured at A and A 3 in Plate\r\nIX. were taken at Mentone on March 17, 1872, and the following\r\nis the technical description of the species, written by Mr.\r\nPickard-Cambridge:--\r\n\r\n  Nemesia Meridionalis. Plate IX.\r\n\r\n  Syn. _Mygale meridionalis_ (Costa). _Fauna del Regno di Napoli_, p.\r\n  14, Pl. I., figs. 1-4, ad partem.\r\n\r\n  Female adult, length 11 to 13 lines.\r\n\r\n  This spider is very nearly allied to _N. cæmentaria_ both in\r\n  general structure and colours, but it may be distinguished by\r\n  the more elongate form both of the cephalothorax and abdomen;\r\n  the colours also of the present species are more distinctly\r\n  distributed; a well-defined narrow marginal band, irregular on\r\n  the inside, surrounds the thorax; and the caput has a large\r\n  curved patch of the same on either side of the ocular area,\r\n  with a broad tapering band tinged with orange, which runs from\r\n  immediately behind the eyes to the thoracic junction, where it\r\n  ends in a point. The transverse diameter of the ocular area is\r\n  also less in proportion to its longitudinal diameter than in _N.\r\n  cæmentaria_, and the eyes are all smaller, but placed on a similar\r\n  oval eminence, and several bristles are directed forwards from\r\n  the middle of the lower margin of the clypeus, while one or two\r\n  others are found in the ocular area, and three or four more (long,\r\n  strong, and nearly erect) form a longitudinal row along the middle\r\n  of the central tapering thoracic band. The _Falces_ are deeply\r\n  yellow-brown, with two to three elongate oval patches or short\r\n  longitudinal parallel bands on their upper sides; in their armature\r\n  the falces are similar to those of _N. cæmentaria_. The _Labium_\r\n  appeared to be less broad in proportion to its height, and the\r\n  _Sternum_ smaller and of a more oval form than in that species. The\r\n  _Abdomen_ is similarly marked, though the chocolate-brown markings\r\n  appeared to be less deep and dense, being more broken up, but still\r\n  forming several fairly defined, bold, and broad angular bars or\r\n  chevrons on the upper side. The inferior spinners, though small\r\n  (like most of the corresponding pair in species of this family),\r\n  are yet considerably stronger than in _N. cæmentaria_.\r\n\r\n  Adult females of this spider were found in tubular silk-lined\r\n  holes in the earth, closed at the external orifice with a flat\r\n  scale-like hinged lid, covered with lichens and mosses. Not quite\r\n  half way down this tube is a tubular branch running off upwards\r\n  at an angle of 45° or less; the main tube also at this point is\r\n  furnished with an elliptical-hinged valve, with which the spider\r\n  appears to have the power to close the entrance to the branch or\r\n  to shut off the upper part of the main tube. This branch (found\r\n  also in the tubes of very young examples) seems to be certainly\r\n  a strong distinguishing character in the economy of the species,\r\n  and separates it at once from _N. cæmentaria_. In the nest of _N.\r\n  meridionalis_ the tube also projects at times above the surface\r\n  of the soil upwards among the herbage which serves to conceal it.\r\n  Costa appears to have had before him this latter species as well as\r\n  what is here taken as the typical _N. meridionalis_, as he speaks\r\n  of the nests under his observation as being frequently branched,\r\n  while his description would suit both species; his figure, however,\r\n  more nearly agrees in the thoracic pattern with the spider above\r\n  described. Ausserer, in his elaborate paper on the Mygalides,\r\n  lately published (_Beiträge_ &c. vide supra), appears to have\r\n  overlooked _M. meridionalis_ (Costa) altogether; while Canestrini\r\n  and Pavesi (_Catal. degli Araneidi italiani_ in _Atti Soc. Ital.\r\n  Sc. Nat._ xi. (1869)), p. 25, include it under the synonyms of _M.\r\n  fodiens_ Walck., from which it is undoubtedly distinct, as may be\r\n  seen at once, even if it were only by the difference in the form\r\n  and structure of the lid with which the external orifice of the\r\n  tubular nest is closed.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the upper door of these branched nests, as there\r\nis but a very thin coating of earth on their upper surface, it is\r\nrare to find any of the larger mosses or lichens growing upon them;\r\nbut, as if to compensate for this deficiency, a variety of foreign\r\nmaterials are employed which are scarcely ever found in cork doors,\r\nsuch as dead leaves, bits of stick, roots, straw of grasses, &c., and\r\nI have even seen freshly-cut green leaves, apparently gathered for\r\nthe purpose, spun into a door which had recently been constructed.\r\n\r\nBut here again there is the widest possible difference between nest\r\nand nest in the degree of perfection in their concealment; and,\r\nalthough as a rule the surface of the upper door harmonizes well with\r\nthe general appearance of its surroundings, there are some individual\r\nnests in which it readily catches the eye and even attracts attention.\r\n\r\nThus, I have seen nests in mossy banks where the doors, being made\r\nof nothing but earth and silk, showed distinctly as brown patches\r\nagainst the green; and those doors which are covered with earth only,\r\neven when they are surrounded by earth, are often easily detected,\r\nbecause when they dry up, as they quickly do, they become much paler\r\nin colour than the earth of the bank, which retains its moisture.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in no case is the concealment more complete than when dead\r\nleaves are employed to cover the door. In some cases a single\r\nwithered olive leaf only is spun in and suffices to cover the trap;\r\nin others, several are woven together with bits of wood and roots, as\r\nin the accompanying woodcut, which represents different views of the\r\nupper door of the nest which is drawn in Plate X. p. 100.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate XI._]\r\n\r\nIn this nest another interesting feature presents itself, for here\r\nthe tube projects a short way beyond the surface of the ground and\r\nis hardened and coated with earth and fine gravel in such a way that\r\nit requires no other support. This is not commonly the case, and may\r\nperhaps be the result of a contrivance to meet the necessities of\r\na nest which has had the surface earth washed away from it. But I\r\nhave frequently observed nests in which the upper part of the tube\r\nis carried up for two or three inches through grass, moss, ferns,\r\npellitory, or the like, the stems of the sheltering plants being\r\ninterwoven with and made to support the tube.[68] In every case\r\nthe second door, which is designed for resistance and requires a\r\nfirm-walled tube into which it may be wedged, is below ground, and\r\nfor the same reason we scarcely ever find cork nests constructed with\r\nany part of the tube projecting beyond the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: This aërial portion of the tube corresponds with that\r\nof _Atypus piceus_ described above (p. 78), but differs in having its\r\naperture closed by a door.]\r\n\r\nAt fig. A, Plate XI., one of these branched nests is seen concealed\r\nin a plant of ceterach fern, and here the tube is raised a short way\r\nabove the soil; while in fig. B of the same plate the common form is\r\nrepresented, the upper door lying flat on the surface of the ground,\r\nfrom which, thanks to its covering of small mosses, it is scarcely to\r\nbe distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe figs. B 1 and B 2 show this door open and the lower door in its\r\ntwo positions.\r\n\r\nNow that attention has been drawn to the existence of this new type\r\nof nest, I fully expect that _Nemesia meridionalis_ will be found at\r\nmany points along the Riviera and in the whole Mediterranean region,\r\nbut I have hitherto only discovered it at Mentone and Cannes. Mrs.\r\nBoyle saw one of these nests in the Pallavicini gardens near Genoa,\r\nand there seems every reason to believe that certain nests which have\r\nbeen detected near Naples and in Ischia, will, when better known, be\r\nfound to be of the branched double-door type.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that our spider belongs to the species which\r\nwas first described by M. Costa,[69] under the name of _Mygale\r\nmeridionalis_, though, if we are to rely implicitly on the figures\r\nand detailed account given by this naturalist, we must suppose that\r\nit constructs a different nest in Southern Italy from that which it\r\nmakes on the Riviera, and one which, although it agrees in most other\r\nrespects, is destitute of the characteristic subterranean door.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Fauna del Regno di Napoli, (vol. containing _Animali\r\nArticolati_, classe ii. Aracnidi: incomplete, Naples, 1861), p. 14,\r\ntab. i. figs. 1-4. See Appendix A.]\r\n\r\nIt is more likely, however, that M. Costa has overlooked the\r\nexistence of the lower door, though it is strange that he should have\r\ndone so, as he says that the nests \"sometimes have a double aperture,\r\nand the upper portions of the burrows meet and anastomose at about\r\ntwo inches distance,\" thus showing that he was aware that the tube is\r\nbranched.\r\n\r\nOne more nest only now remains to be described, and this is\r\nagain an example of a new type--namely, of that which I have\r\ndistinguished as the unbranched double door (Plate XII.), the work\r\nof _Nemesia Eleanora_. This nest is never branched, and its second\r\nand subterranean door is situated from one to four inches below\r\nthe surface door, and only serves to close the one tube which is\r\nnarrowed above the insertion of this lower door. Here, as in the\r\nbranched nest, the thin and wafer-like surface door appears to serve\r\nprincipally for concealment and the lower one for resistance. This\r\nlatter, made out of earth encased in strong white silk, is from\r\none to two lines thick, and has, at the end away from the hinge, a\r\nsimilar appendage to that found in the lower door of the branched\r\nnest. This appendage serves, I imagine, as a kind of ear by which the\r\ndoor, when firmly jammed into the tube on the approach of an enemy,\r\nmay be pulled down again as soon as the alarm is over. As in the\r\nbranched nest it has the upper surface concave and the lower slightly\r\nrounded, so that when drawn back and not in use it may not obstruct\r\nthe passage. The sides of this lower door slope a little, so that\r\nthe crown is smaller than the base; and this is important, because\r\nit causes the door to fit more tightly when driven upwards into the\r\ntube, acting on the principle of an inverted cork door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate XII._]\r\n\r\nIn form this door is somewhat elliptic, but much broader and shorter\r\nthan the second door of the branched nest, and it is frequently of\r\na nearly horse-shoe shaped outline. The second door of the branched\r\nnest is necessarily longer, having to perform the double function of\r\nclosing the opening to the branch and the passage of the main tube.\r\n\r\nIn either case, however, these doors will be found to be more or less\r\nelliptic, and this is necessarily so, for, lying as they do when in\r\nuse in a plane which cuts the subcylindrical tube obliquely, they\r\nhave to fill a somewhat elliptical area.[70]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: The lower door here, as in the branched nest (see\r\nabove, p. 100), is sometimes united to the silk of the tube below by\r\ntwo nearly triangular gussets of silk, when, instead of being free\r\nexcept at the hinge, as I have represented it (Plate XII.), it is\r\nsurrounded on either side by silk and only free at the extremity away\r\nfrom the hinge. This does not, however, alter the function of this\r\ndoor in any way.\r\n\r\nIt may be that these lower doors are always attached from below\r\nin this way, but it is very difficult to be sure of this, as they\r\nreadily break away from the surrounding silk, when they appear quite\r\nfree, as in my drawing. It was not until I adopted the plan of\r\nstuffing the tube full of cotton wool before removing the surrounding\r\nearth that I detected this fragile attachment.]\r\n\r\nI have observed some variation as to the exact proportions of these\r\ndoors, and it is quite possible that in many cases they are specially\r\nadapted to meet peculiarities in the curvature of the tube.\r\n\r\nThe nest and spider drawn at figs. A and A 3 of Plate XII. were first\r\ndiscovered by the Honourable Mrs. Richard Boyle at Mentone, on March\r\n26th, 1872, and the following is the description of the species\r\nkindly prepared by Mr. Pickard-Cambridge:--\r\n\r\n  Nemesia Eleanora, sp. nov. Plate XII.\r\n\r\n  Female adult, length 11 to 12 lines.\r\n\r\n  This spider, which has (like _N. meridionalis_) probably been\r\n  confused with its near ally _N. cæmentaria_, is yet easily\r\n  distinguished from both by its deeper and richer colouring, as well\r\n  as by other characters.\r\n\r\n  The _Abdomen_ has a far more spotted appearance; in some examples\r\n  a similar series of dark, broken, slightly angular bars is\r\n  indistinctly visible on the hinder half of the upper side; in\r\n  others (the more common type) the darker colouring preponderates,\r\n  and some transverse, broken, slightly angular, or nearly curved\r\n  bars or lines of pale spots constitute the pattern; the lateral\r\n  margins of the thorax are not so distinctly yellow as in _N.\r\n  meridionalis_, and there is a single longitudinal stripe on the\r\n  caput, of a dull orange-yellow brown, commencing directly behind\r\n  the eyes and tapering to the thoracic junction; the depression\r\n  or pit at this point is more strongly marked than in either of\r\n  the two foregoing species; the ocular area is also smaller, and\r\n  its transverse diameter is less in proportion to its width; the\r\n  bristles on the margin of the clypeus, as also those within the\r\n  ocular area and in the central longitudinal line of the caput, are\r\n  similarly disposed to those in _N. meridionalis_, but are more\r\n  numerous; in some details, however, of form and structure--viz.,\r\n  the Labium and Sternum--the present species is more nearly allied\r\n  to _N. meridionalis_ than to _N. cæmentaria_. The _Legs_ seemed\r\n  to be rather longer and stronger than in either; the tarsi and\r\n  metatarsi of the two first pairs, as well as the digital joints of\r\n  the palpi, are rather densely clothed a little underneath on their\r\n  outer sides with a kind of fringe or pad of close-set hairs; in\r\n  other respects the armature of the legs appeared to be similar to\r\n  that of the other two species, except that in the present one there\r\n  are three _short strong red-brown spines in a longitudinal row on\r\n  the outer sides of the genual joints of the third pair_; these\r\n  spines were plainly visible in all the examples found, but did not\r\n  exist in any one of those of the two former species. The armature\r\n  of the falces, which are of a uniform yellow-brown colour, is\r\n  similar to that of those species.\r\n\r\n  Adult females were found in tubular silk-lined unbranched holes,\r\n  closed at the orifice with a flat scale-like hinged lid concealed\r\n  by mosses and lichens, and having a horse-shoe shaped second valve\r\n  or door less than half way down the tube, of which it serves\r\n  to shut off the upper part. In this nest, as in that of _N.\r\n  meridionalis_, the upper part of the tube often projects above the\r\n  surface of the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nemesia Eleanora ♂ Adult, natural size.]\r\n\r\n  Since the above description of the female of this species was\r\n  written, an example of the adult male has been most opportunely\r\n  discovered. It is much smaller than the female, its length being\r\n  only six lines. The _Cephalothorax_ is of an uniform clear\r\n  yellow-brown colour, tinged with orange, and thinly clothed with\r\n  a greyish pubescence: the oblique indentations marking the union\r\n  of the cephalic and thoracic segments are indicated by a strongish\r\n  black-brown band on either side, which becomes obsolete as each\r\n  approaches the other near the central curved indentation; there\r\n  are also two or three converging suffused blackish stripes on the\r\n  hinder slope. The relative length of the _Legs_ is the same in both\r\n  sexes, 4, 1, 2, 3, but in the male those of the fourth are longer\r\n  in proportion to those of the third pair than in the female; the\r\n  spines also on the legs are more numerous and stronger, the upper\r\n  sides of the femora of all the legs are deeply suffused with black,\r\n  while in the female this suffusion is not nearly of so marked a\r\n  character, though the genua of the different females examined\r\n  had a strong brown-black macula on the outer side of each, while\r\n  the corresponding maculæ in the single male examined were but\r\n  just visible; the three spines observed on the outer side of the\r\n  genua of the third pair of legs in the female are of even a more\r\n  marked character in the male, and hence they may be considered a\r\n  good and tangible specific difference from other nearly allied\r\n  species; the tibiæ of the first pair are considerably enlarged on\r\n  the under side at the fore extremity, where each is armed with\r\n  a single, longish, strong, slightly curved, pointed black spine\r\n  directed forwards (fig. _a_, 3). The _Abdomen_ is small and of an\r\n  oval form; its colours and markings resemble those of the female,\r\n  but on the hinder half of the upper side two or three indistinctly\r\n  traced pale angular bars or chevrons are formed by the distribution\r\n  of the black-brown colours and markings; the under side of the\r\n  abdomen is of a uniform pale whitish yellow, except the spiracular\r\n  plates, which are yellow-brown. The _Palpi_ are moderately long\r\n  and strong; the radial joint is longer than the cubital, and is of\r\n  a tumid and somewhat oval form, suffused over most of its surface\r\n  with dark brown, the rest of the palpus being of a yellowish-brown\r\n  colour; the digital joint is small and somewhat oblong-oval, curved\r\n  downwards, and very slightly concave on its inside; the palpal\r\n  organs consist of a nearly globular, basal, corneous bulb prolonged\r\n  into a strongish, curved, but not very long, pear-stem form, the\r\n  stem being distinctly cleft or bifid at its extreme point (_vide_\r\n  figs. _a_ 1, and _a_ 2), one portion of the bifid part is larger\r\n  than the other, though both are equal in length, and the stem of\r\n  the palpal bulb is directed transversely outwards, almost at right\r\n  angles with the digital joint.\r\n\r\n  Until the discovery of the male spider now described, and which is,\r\n  without doubt, the male sex of the female described immediately\r\n  before, this latter was thought to be the female of _Nemesia\r\n  Manderstjernæ_ (Ausserer), and it had indeed been so determined\r\n  by Professor Ausserer himself. But the form of the palpal organs\r\n  differs so decidedly from those of _N. Manderstjernæ_ (Ausserer,\r\n  _Beiträge ... der Territelariæ, Verhandl. Z. B. Gesllsch_: Wien,\r\n  1871, Bd. xxi. p. 170), that all doubts as to the present being\r\n  a distinct (and as it is believed to be) a hitherto undescribed\r\n  species, are removed. From M. Ausserer's description, the\r\n  pear shaped stem of the palpal bulb in _N. Manderstjernæ_ is\r\n  comparatively slender, ending in a fine and uncleft point, whereas,\r\n  in _N. Eleanora_, the stem is strong and its extremity cleft: other\r\n  differences are also observable in the two spiders, but this one is\r\n  well marked and the most tangible.\r\n\r\n  The specific name, _Eleanora_, now conferred upon the species, is\r\n  taken from the Christian name of the Hon. Mrs. Boyle, reference\r\n  to whom has been before made, and of whose kind exertions some\r\n  acknowledgment is thus permanently recorded.\r\n\r\nIn fig. A, Plate XII., the upper door, which, if closed, would be\r\nentirely hidden by the long filmy mosses which surround and cover it,\r\nis represented open; but it should be clearly understood that this is\r\nartificial and not natural, as in reality these doors close of their\r\nown accord by means of their weight and the elasticity of the hinge.\r\nIt will be seen that living mosses of two kinds are worked into the\r\nupper surface of this door, which was admirably concealed. (fig. A 1,\r\nPlate XII.).\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly in the absence of the branch and the different form\r\nof the lower door that the nest of _Nemesia Eleanora_ differs from\r\nthat of _N. meridionalis_; and, as they inhabit the same localities,\r\nit is only when one has dug down as far as the lower door that it\r\ncan be known to which of the two species the nest belongs. When once\r\nthis point is reached however, all doubt is at an end; for in this\r\ncase the unbranched double-door nest differs from the branched in a\r\nway which any child could realize, though the respective spiders are\r\nnot very dissimilar when seen with the naked eye alone. This affords\r\na good instance of the benefit which may accrue to a collector from\r\na study of the habits of the creatures which he collects, for it is\r\ncertain that it was the nest in this case which first proclaimed the\r\ndistinctness of its tenant.\r\n\r\n_Nemesia Eleanora_ is rather less common at Mentone than _N.\r\nmeridionalis_, but at Cannes I found the reverse to be the case. At\r\nthe latter place, on the northern slope of the little hill of St.\r\nCassien, branched and unbranched double-door nests may, however, be\r\nfound in tolerable abundance, the traps being frequently concealed by\r\nfallen leaves from the cork oaks, which are woven into their upper\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe nest of _N. Eleanora_ often has the upper part of the tube\r\nprolonged above the surface of the ground and carried up through\r\nmosses, grasses, and the like.\r\n\r\nAn example of this is seen in figs. B and B 1, Plate XII., in which\r\nthe upper part of the tube is represented with the surface door open\r\nin the one case and shut in the other.\r\n\r\nThe concealment here was so complete that I should never have\r\ndiscovered the nest but for the merest accident. I happened to\r\nwant some moss to lay with flowers in my botanical tin, and in one\r\nhandful which I plucked up this trap-door lay concealed. It should be\r\nobserved that the upper part of the tube and its surface door were\r\ncovered with growing moss, and this moss must have lived exclusively\r\nupon the moisture which the very damp and shady situation afforded,\r\nas there was no earth mixed with the silk.\r\n\r\nWhen digging out the nests of _N. Eleanora_, I have frequently seen\r\nthe lower doors pushed forwards so as to close the tube; and it is\r\nmy belief that the spider, after having thus barred the passage,\r\nputs her back against the door and resists in this way. I must own,\r\nhowever, that, though I believe I have seen the spider in this\r\nattitude when I have severed the tube from below, I am not quite\r\ncertain about it.\r\n\r\nI have twice in the months of April and May, and frequently in\r\nOctober and November, found young of this species in the nests with\r\ntheir mother. Usually they were all very small and not larger than\r\nthat represented at fig. B 2, Plate IX., p. 98, but occasionally\r\nin October I have found two or three young spiders thrice the size\r\nof their companions still in the nest. On one occasion (in April) I\r\nfound twenty-four small spiders clustered beneath and beside their\r\nmother.[71] I secured the whole family by quickly cutting out the\r\nmass of earth containing the lower door on the under side of which\r\nthey remained crouched, and brought them home alive. I had up to\r\nthis time been in the habit of killing the spiders by placing them\r\nin a stopper bottle full of strong spirit of wine, but on treating\r\nthese spiders in this way I saw reason to regret having done so. I\r\nknew that these large spiders, when thrown into spirit of wine, would\r\ncontinue to struggle for an hour or more, spasmodically spreading\r\nout their legs as if swimming; but I had supposed that this was only\r\nmuscular motion, and was not in the least aware that the unfortunate\r\ncreatures were probably conscious all the while. In this instance I\r\nfirst placed the mother spider in the bottle, and then, after the\r\nlapse of about ten minutes, when I supposed that the spider, though\r\nstill struggling, was dead to sense, I dropped in the young spiders.\r\nNo sooner, however, had I done this than the mother, perceiving them,\r\ngathered all her young to her, and, after placing them beneath her,\r\nwith her legs drawn up round them, as a hen screens her chickens with\r\nher wings, never stirred again, and retained this attitude until\r\ndeath released her, and the limbs, no longer under the control of\r\nthis wonderful maternal resolution, slackened and fell abroad.[72]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: I have found similar families in October and November\r\nin the nests of _N. meridionalis_, only all the young were of nearly\r\nuniform size, and very small. On November 21 I dug out a mother\r\nspider of this species (_meridionalis_) with forty-one little ones!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: My own impression is that this act was one of\r\nconscious protection on the part of the mother spider; but Mr.\r\nPickard-Cambridge doubts this, and would attribute the action to the\r\ntendency which spiders commonly display to clutch at any material\r\nobject when dying in this way.]\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say that the small spiders were killed by the spirit\r\nin a very few instants, but it is almost certain that the mother was\r\nalive and conscious for half an hour. Now this pain can easily be\r\nspared by placing large spiders for about ten minutes in a closed box\r\nwith a piece of cotton wool steeped in chloroform beside them, before\r\ndropping them into the spirit of wine, a system which I have since\r\nthat day adopted and found to answer perfectly.\r\n\r\nI examined these young spiders carefully, hoping to detect some\r\nmales among them, but the males, though they differ markedly from\r\nthe females when adult in their smaller size and curiously enlarged\r\npalpi, do not appear to afford any distinctive mark at this early\r\nperiod. It appeared that these spiders had been but recently hatched,\r\nfor some among them were still semi-transparent.\r\n\r\nI have never found young spiders in the nests of _Cteniza fodiens_ or\r\n_Nemesia cæmentaria_.\r\n\r\nM. de Walckenaer[73] quotes a statement made by M. Rossi to the\r\neffect that _Cteniza fodiens_ carries its young on her back, as\r\ncertain species of _Lycosa_ (Tarantula) do. He points out the\r\ninterest which would attach to this observation if confirmed, as\r\nshowing a similarity in habit between the two groups, which are\r\notherwise nearly related.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Walckenaer (C. A. de), Les Aranéides de France (date?),\r\np. 5.]\r\n\r\nObservations of this kind are difficult to make satisfactorily,\r\nat least in the case of the trap-door spiders with which I am\r\nacquainted, and which appear to be nocturnal in their habits. I have\r\ncertainly never seen them out of their nests in the daytime, and but\r\nrarely detected one of them (_Nemesia cæmentaria_) even venturing to\r\npeer out of her door set ajar for the purpose.[74]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: M. Olivier, however, states (Encyclopédie Méthodique,\r\ntom xviii., p. 228, Art. Araignées Mineuses, Paris, 1811) that he has\r\ntwice found nests in the islands off Hyères and on the promontory of\r\nSt. Tropez the doors of which were set open in the daytime and the\r\ntube empty, this seeming to imply that the spiders were out hunting\r\nand were diurnal in their habits. He did not see the spiders, but\r\nfrom his description the nest was of the cork type.... Here is an\r\ninteresting point, and one which those naturalists who make Hyères\r\nthe field of their observations should endeavour to throw further\r\nlight upon.]\r\n\r\nThe following very singular account is given by M. Erber[75] of the\r\nhabits of _Cteniza ariana_, which he watched in the island of Tinos.\r\nI quote from the abstract given in the _Zoological Record_ cited\r\nbelow:--\"At night these spiders come out of their nests, fasten the\r\nopen trap-door to neighbouring objects, and spin a net, about six\r\ninches long by scarcely half an inch in height. In the morning the\r\nnets were removed, and Erber believes that the net of each night is\r\nadded to the trap-door. He found eggs at the bottom of the tubes,\r\nattached singly to threads, to the number of about sixty. The young\r\nseem to form dwellings very early.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: In Verhandlungen der k. k. zool. bot. Gesellschaft in\r\nWien, vol. xviii. pp. 905, 906, quoted in _Zoological Record_, vol.\r\nv. p. 175 (1868); see also Appendix B.]\r\n\r\nIt would be very interesting to know whether these nocturnal habits\r\nare also found in our spiders on the Riviera.\r\n\r\nI have been favoured[76] with a sight of an unpublished manuscript\r\nby Mr. Hansard giving an account of his observations on _Cteniza\r\nfodiens_, made in Corfu. This gentleman states that some of these\r\nspiders which he kept in captivity, used to come out at night, and\r\nmight sometimes be surprised roaming about the room at a very early\r\nhour in the morning. He, however, relates that he had received from\r\na friend an account of a trap-door spider inhabiting the island of\r\nFormosa, in the China seas, which constructed nests similar to those\r\nof _Cteniza fodiens_, but which were habitually to be seen outside\r\ntheir nests in the daytime, attracting attention by \"staring at\" any\r\none who might approach, and then hurrying back to their nests and\r\nclosing their doors after them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: I am indebted to Mr. Moseley for procuring this MS.,\r\nand to Prof. Rolleston, whose property it is, for permission to make\r\nuse of it.]\r\n\r\nLady Parker has also told me of some black trap-door spiders which\r\nwere so common about Paramatta, near Sydney, in Australia, that\r\nscarcely any one paid attention to them, and which might habitually\r\nbe seen out on the garden paths in the daytime near their holes,\r\nto which they would run in all haste when alarmed. The eye of the\r\npasser-by was attracted by the open doors, which were about the size\r\nof a sixpence, and fall over backwards when the spider makes her\r\nexit, but when closed, on her return, they fit so neatly that it is\r\nextremely difficult to detect them.\r\n\r\nIt will, perhaps, have been observed that I have throughout spoken of\r\nthe female spider only, scarcely any allusion having been made to the\r\nmale. The truth is that, though I have carefully searched for them,\r\nI have never been able to secure more than a single male spider.[77]\r\nDuring the winter, spring, and late autumn (October) the female\r\nappears to live solitary, in the daytime at least, and the male\r\nprobably hides in the crevices of old walls and in similar places. I\r\nhave diligently turned over piles of stone, greatly to the annoyance\r\nof many little scorpions, but have never secured, or even seen,\r\nanother male spider. This is the more to be regretted as the species\r\nof trap-door spider are much better characterized in the male than in\r\nthe female sex, the bulb-like enlargement which is found at the end\r\nof the palpi in the former taking on a great variety of forms, each\r\nof which is distinctive.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: Three days before sending this MS. to print, and long\r\nafter the plates had been completed, I captured on Oct. 23rd one male\r\nof _Nemesia Eleanora_. He lay crouched in a crevice in a mossy bank,\r\nand had, perhaps, been driven out of some deeper hiding-place by the\r\nheavy rains.]\r\n\r\nM. de Walckenaer[78] says:--\"C'est toujours pendant la nuit que\r\nces aranéides travaillent à leurs habitations et courent après\r\nleur proie. C'est en Août que la Mygale maçonne (_Nemesia_--or\r\n_Mygale_--_cæmentaria_) atteint toute sa grosseur.... En Septembre\r\nelle devient mère et méchante en même temps ... les mouches, les\r\nmoucherons, les petits vers lui servent de pâture; elle les prend\r\ndans les filets qu'elle étend et attache sur les inégalités des\r\nterres voisines de sa demeure. Elle vit après la ponte en société\r\navec son mâle. Dorthès a vu plusieurs fois, dans la même habitation,\r\nle mâle et la femelle avec une trentaine de petits.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Les Aranéides de France, p. 4.]\r\n\r\nAny one, therefore, who has an opportunity of examining the nests\r\nduring the early autumn, might perhaps, discover the happy families\r\nspoken of by M. Dorthès, but which it has never been my good fortune\r\nto see. It is not known positively whether the male spider ever\r\nassists in the construction of the nest, but, as we know that the\r\nfemale is able to make it without his aid, there seems no reason to\r\nsuppose that he does.\r\n\r\nI have seen the female _Nemesia meridionalis_ construct a trap-door\r\nin captivity, after having been placed on a flower-pot full of earth\r\nin which I had made a cylindrical hole.[79] She quickly disappeared\r\ninto this hole, and, during the night following the day of her\r\ncapture, she made a thin web over the aperture, into which she\r\nwove any materials which came to hand. The trap-door at this stage\r\nresembled a rudely constructed, horizontal, geometrical web, attached\r\nby two or three threads to the earth at the mouth of the hole, while\r\nin this web were caught the bits of earth, roots, moss, leaves &c.\r\nwhich the spider had thrown into it from above. After the second\r\nnight the door appeared nearly of the normal texture and thickness,\r\nbut in no case would it open completely, and it seemed that the\r\nspider was too much disgusted with her quarters to think it worth\r\nwhile to make a perfect door. I believe that when a door is finished\r\nthe few threads which served as supports and connected it with the\r\nearth on either side of the hinge are severed, and this is borne out\r\nby the following instance. While I was at work one evening drawing\r\nthe spider's nest concealed in the plant of ceterach fern (Plate\r\nXI., fig. A, p. 105) which I had dug out for the purpose, I detected\r\nsomething moving at the mouth of a tiny hole [just large enough to\r\nadmit a crowquill pen] in the mass of earth on the opposite side of\r\nthe fern, to that in which the large trap-door lay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: An account of further experiments with captive spiders\r\nwill be found in Appendix G.]\r\n\r\nThe lamp-light fell full upon it, and I soon saw that the moving\r\nobject was a very small spider, not bigger than that drawn at B 2\r\nin Plate IX., which was at work in the mouth of its tube. Whether\r\nI had, in removing this mass of earth, destroyed the door I cannot\r\nsay, but it is certain that the opening of the tube was completely\r\nuncovered, and it soon became apparent that the little spider was\r\nintent upon remedying this deficiency. After a few threads had been\r\nspun from side to side of the tube I watched the spider make one or\r\ntwo hasty sorties, apparently spinning all the while, and finally I\r\nsaw her gather up an armful, as it were, of earth and lay this on the\r\nweb. After this the occupant of the tube was concealed, but I could\r\nsee from the movement of the particles of earth that they were being\r\nconsolidated, and that the weaving of the under surface of the door\r\nwas being completed. Next morning I was able to lift up the door,\r\nwhich had the form of a small cup of silk, in which the earth lay. It\r\nwas then soft and pliant, but in ten days time it had hardened and\r\nbecome a very fair specimen of a minute cork door (see figs. A 1, A\r\n2, of Plate XI.).\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a captive _Nemesia meridionalis_ employed some pieces\r\nof scarlet braid which I had purposely strewed, along with bits of\r\nmoss and fragments of leaves, in a circle round the opening of, and\r\nabout two inches away from, the hole.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that these spiders have in times past learned by\r\nexperience that they cannot do better than take such materials as\r\ncome to hand, as these will ordinarily serve for the concealment of\r\ntheir door.\r\n\r\nHowever, these trap-door spiders do seem to exercise some\r\ndiscrimination in the choice of materials; for I have observed\r\nseveral instances in which, when the door of a cork nest has been\r\nremoved, if the door was originally covered with moss, moss will\r\nagain be used in its reconstruction, even though the mouth of the\r\ntube be then surrounded by bare earth.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, in one case where I had cut out a little clod of\r\nmossy earth, about two inches thick and three square on the surface,\r\ncontaining the top of the tube and the moss-covered cork door of _N.\r\ncæmentaria_, I found, on revisiting the place six days later, that a\r\nnew door had been made, and that the spider had mounted up to fetch\r\nmoss from the undisturbed bank above, planting it in the earth which\r\nformed the crown of the door.[80] Here the moss actually called the\r\neye to the trap, which lay in the little plain of brown earth made by\r\nmy digging.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Mrs. Boyle first called my attention to this curious\r\nfact, of which I have since seen many examples. I have purposely\r\nremoved several cork doors from mossy banks in order to observe this\r\npoint.]\r\n\r\nI have seen the same thing happen when the door of _N. Eleanora_\r\nhas been removed and replaced, moss being again used in the work\r\nof reconstruction. Trap-door spiders in warm weather very quickly\r\nreplace their trap-doors; and if you pass by a wall where several\r\nnests have been robbed of their doors only a week before, they will\r\nusually be found quite perfect again.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated[81] that, if the door of a cork nest be fastened\r\ndown with a pin, a second door will be found next day by the side of\r\nthe former one. No doubt spiders not unfrequently find their doors\r\nblocked up by a fall of earth, and are thus obliged either to make a\r\nnew opening or to prolong the old tube.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: M. Dorthès on the Structure and Œconomy of some Curious\r\nSpecies of Aranea, in Trans. Linn. Soc. (London), II. 88-90.]\r\n\r\nI once fastened open the surface doors of three of the double-door\r\nnests by passing a thread through the silk of the door and tying it\r\nback to some twigs above. The doors were thus turned backwards, and\r\nthe aperture of the tubes, which lay in a vertical terrace wall,\r\nexposed to view.\r\n\r\nNext day, after a night of very heavy rain, I found the doors as I\r\nhad left them, but in one nest the lip of the tube had been dragged\r\ninwards so as partially to close the tube; in the second nothing\r\nappeared to have been done, but in the third nest a new covering had\r\nbeen very cleverly extemporized out of three fallen olive-leaves,\r\nwhich were loosely spun together and attached by one or two threads\r\nto the margin of the tube. This formed an admirable concealment,\r\nbut did not move freely as a door, the web being too imperfect. Two\r\ndays later, however, it was completed and had become a perfect door,\r\nmoving on a hinge just within and below that of the former door,\r\nwhich still remained as I had fastened it. The other nests remained\r\nin the same condition as before, only that a little moss had been\r\ndragged into the mouth of the tube of the nest, which had been\r\npartially closed with its own lip.\r\n\r\nThe extreme reluctance which these spiders show to abandon their\r\ndwellings is curiously exemplified by what follows.\r\n\r\nCertain nests which were furnished with two doors of the cork type\r\nwere observed by Mr. S. S. Saunders[82] in the Ionian Islands.\r\nThe door at the surface of these nests was normal in position and\r\nstructure, but the lower one was placed at the very bottom of the\r\nnest and inverted, so that, though apparently intended to open\r\ndownwards, it was permanently closed by the surrounding earth. The\r\npresence of a carefully constructed door in a situation which forbade\r\nthe possibility of its ever being opened seemed, indeed, something\r\ndifficult to account for. However, it occurred to Mr. Saunders that,\r\nas these nests were found in the cultivated ground round the roots\r\nof olive-trees, they may occasionally have got turned topsy-turvy\r\nwhen the soil was broken up. The spider then, finding her door buried\r\nbelow in the ground and the bottom of the tube at the surface, would\r\nhave either to seek new quarters or to adapt the nest to its altered\r\nposition, and make an opening and door at the exposed end. In order\r\nto try whether one of these spiders would do this Mr. Saunders placed\r\na nest, with its occupant inside, upside down in a flower-pot.\r\nAfter the lapse of ten days a new door was made, exactly as he had\r\nconjectured it would be, and the nest presented two doors like those\r\nwhich he had found at first.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Description of a species of Mygale from Ionia in Trans.\r\nof Ent. Soc. (London, 1839), III. p. 160.]\r\n\r\nThere is a specimen of one of these inverted nests, with its two\r\ndoors, in the British Museum, and this might easily be supposed, at\r\nfirst sight, to be an example of a new kind of double-door nest. On\r\nclose inspection, however, it will be seen that one of the two doors\r\nis discoloured and partly decayed, this being, no doubt, the one\r\nwhich had been buried beneath in the earth and so rendered useless.\r\n\r\nQuestions have often been asked as to the manner in which trap-door\r\nnests are commenced in the first instance, and whether the weaving of\r\nthe silk lining is begun at the top or the bottom of the tube.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the cork door also, which often appears so perfectly\r\nturned as to resemble the work of a potter's lathe, is another\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThese questions have, as it seems to me, been needlessly complicated\r\nby taking it for granted that the perfect nest of the mature spider\r\nis made all at one time, that the tube, perhaps of a foot in length,\r\nis excavated, lined, and furnished with a door within some short\r\nperiod of time, such as ten days or a fortnight, perhaps.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, I believe that the nests are, as a rule, the result\r\nof many successive enlargements, and that the nest of the infant, the\r\ntube of which is no bigger than a crowquill, is not abandoned, but\r\nbecomes that of the full-grown spider. This must require time, but\r\nhow long, whether months or years, we have yet to learn.\r\n\r\nVery little is known at present as to the longevity of spiders, but\r\nMr. Blackwall[83] says that some live only one year, while others,\r\nsuch as _Tegenaria civilis_ and _Segestria senoculata_, have been\r\nknown to live four.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: Spiders of Great Britain and Ireland, p. 8.]\r\n\r\nWhether the trap-door spiders are very long lived or not I cannot\r\npositively say, but, from the appearance of the growth of moss and\r\nlichen on the doors of some nests which I have observed, I am\r\ninclined to think that they must have been inhabited for more than a\r\ntwelvemonth.\r\n\r\nEvidence of the enlargement of the door is not very rare to meet\r\nwith, though, as a rule, the new piece is woven on to the old with\r\nsuch neatness as more or less to obscure this. In fig. B, Plate\r\nX., p. 100, the old and smaller surface-door of a nest of _Nemesia\r\nmeridionalis_ is seen partially attached to the larger new door,\r\nwhich has been constructed below it; while in fig. C of the same\r\nplate, three doors, or rather three enlargements of one door, may\r\nbe traced. It is this, I believe, that gives rise to the tiled\r\nappearance which these trap-doors sometimes present, and which has\r\ncaused them to be compared to oyster-shells. Something similar may\r\nalso be occasionally seen in doors of the cork type, as, for example,\r\nin that figured at A and A 1 in Plate VIII., p. 94, where the old\r\nand smaller door is seen partially raised above the surface of the\r\nnew one. This I imagine to be merely an example of rather clumsy\r\nworkmanship, as, if I am right, a full-sized cork door usually\r\nincloses within itself several lesser doors, which formerly fitted\r\nthe tube and have had to be enlarged.\r\n\r\nThis is borne out by the fact that such a door will, on examination,\r\nbe found to consist of several layers of silk, with more or less\r\nearth between each, these layers decreasing in size from without\r\ninwards, and together forming a sort of saucer in which the small\r\ncentral mass of earth lies. Thus by moistening a series of the cork\r\ndoors of _Nemesia cæmentaria_, I have been able to detach, in one of\r\nmedium size, from six to fourteen circular patches of silk, of which\r\nthe outermost, or that which forms the lower surface of the door,\r\nis the largest, and the innermost the smallest, the others being\r\nintermediate in size as in position. Perhaps if I had had larger\r\ndoors at my disposal for examination I might have found more layers,\r\nas other authors[84] speak of a much greater number of layers in the\r\ncork doors of _Cteniza fodiens_. Be this as it may, I am confirmed in\r\nmy opinion that the layers of silk mark the successive enlargements\r\nof the nest by the additional fact that in very small doors the\r\nlayers of silk are few or single, and that a proportion is observable\r\nas a rule between the size of the door and the number of layers of\r\nwhich it is composed.[85]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: M. de Walckenaer seems to have found more than thirty\r\nalternate layers of silk and earth in one of the doors of _Cteniza\r\nfodiens_, as we may gather from the following:--\"Quoique cette\r\nporte n'ait guère que trois lignes d'epaisseur, elle est formée par\r\nla superposition de plus de trente couches de terre séparées les\r\nunes des autres par autant de couches de toile. Toutes ces assises\r\nsuccessives s'emboitent les unes dans les autres comme les poids de\r\ncuivre à l'usage de nos petites balances. Les couches de toile se\r\nterminent au pourtour de la porte.\" Walckenaer, Histoire des Insectes\r\nAptères (Suites à Buffon), vol. i. p. 238 (Paris, 1837).\r\n\r\nI have not found the regular layers of earth and silk of which M.\r\nde Walckenaer speaks, the silk layers being usually in contact\r\nat their centres and only separated by a little ring of earth\r\ninterposed between their edges, this earth being thickest towards the\r\ncircumference of the layers of silk.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: This may be seen by the comparison of the composition\r\nof doors of different sizes, given in Appendix H.]\r\n\r\nAnother proof that enlargement takes place, may at times be found in\r\nthe nests of _N. Eleanora_, where one, or even two useless doors may\r\nbe detected behind the lower door.\r\n\r\nNow when there are three lower doors in this way the one which is in\r\nuse is the largest, and the door lying nearest to this one the next\r\nin size, while the hindmost is the smallest of all. But though those\r\nabandoned doors are now too small to fit the existing tube, they did\r\nso, no doubt, in their day, for they are exact copies in miniature of\r\nthe ordinary horse-shoe shaped lower doors. The lower door actually\r\nin use may sometimes be found to have two separable cases of thick\r\nsilk enclosing the central mass of earth, and this also, very\r\nprobably, represents enlargement. In the nests of _N. meridionalis_ I\r\nhave never found any of these abandoned doors behind the one in use,\r\nnor should I expect to find any, for if they were present they would\r\npermanently obstruct the entrance from the main tube to the branch.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that it is better economy on the part of the spider to\r\nenlarge its nest rather than build a new one each time. If we compare\r\nthe infant spider and its nest (fig. B, Plate IX., p. 98) with the\r\nfull-grown creature and its nest (fig. A, Plate IX.), it becomes\r\nevident that the growing spider must either construct many nests of\r\nintermediate size, or frequently enlarge the original domicile. And\r\nwe do in fact find nests of all sizes between the two extremes.\r\n\r\nI cannot help thinking that these very small nests, built as they are\r\nby minute spiders probably not very long hatched from the egg, must\r\nrank among the most marvellous structures of the kind with which we\r\nare acquainted. That so young and weak a creature should be able to\r\nexcavate a tube in the earth many times its own length, and know how\r\nto make a perfect miniature of the nest of its parents, seems to be a\r\nfact which has scarcely a parallel in nature.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember how difficult a thing it is for even a trained\r\ndraughtsman to reduce by eye a complicated drawing or model to a\r\ngreatly diminished scale, we must own that the performance of this\r\nfeat by a baby spider is so surprising as almost to exceed belief.\r\n\r\nAnd yet even the most complicated form of nest--namely, that of the\r\nbranched double-door type--is perfectly reproduced in miniature by\r\nthese tiny architects, with the upper door, lower door, main tube,\r\nand branch (fig. B, Plate IX., p. 98).\r\n\r\nIn order to test whether the doors are enlarged or not I measured the\r\nsurface doors of seven double-door nests and one minute cork door on\r\nApril 30th, making a careful plan of the terrace wall in which they\r\nlay, in order to make sure of finding them again on my return to\r\nMentone in October.\r\n\r\nThe following table will show that all were enlarged, the average\r\nrate of increase being 1-7/10 lines in the five and a half months\r\nwhich had elapsed:--\r\n\r\n  _Measured April 30, 1872._  |   _Measured Oct. 18, 1872._\r\n                              |\r\n  No. I. 9 lines across       | No. I. 10-1/2 lines across\r\n     II. 4      \"             |    II. 5-1/2       \"\r\n    III. 4-1/2  \"             |   III. 5-1/2       \"\r\n     IV. 4      \"             |    IV. 4-1/2       \"\r\n      V. 2      \"             |     V. 3           \"\r\n     VI. 2-1/2  \"             |    VI. missing\r\n    VII. 1      \"  (the cork) |   VII. 2 lines across\r\n   VIII. 5      \"             |  VIII. 7-1/2       \"\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely venture from such limited premises to draw any\r\nprecise conclusions, but if we suppose that during the entire course\r\nof the year the nests increase on an average by about four lines in\r\ndiameter, and assume that the rate of growth continue the same, the\r\nnest of the infant spider, whose surface door measures scarcely a\r\nline across, would still require four years to attain the dimensions\r\nof some of the largest double-door nests, whose surface doors measure\r\nsixteen lines across.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the rule with spiders generally that the offspring\r\nshould leave the nest and construct dwellings for themselves when\r\nvery young.\r\n\r\nMr. Blackwall,[86] speaking of British spiders, says:--\"Complicated\r\nas the processes are by which these symmetrical nets are produced,\r\nnevertheless young spiders, acting under the influence of instinctive\r\nimpulse, display, even in their first attempts to fabricate them, as\r\nconsummate skill as the most experienced individuals.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Loc. cit., p. 11.]\r\n\r\nAgain, Mr. F. Pollock[87] relates of the young of _Epeira aurelia_,\r\nwhich he observed in Madeira, that when seven weeks old they made a\r\nweb the size of a penny, and that these nets have the same beautiful\r\nsymmetry as those of the full-grown spider. Those of the latter are\r\nvertical, circular, made of about 250 feet of thread, having about\r\n35 radial lines and 38 concentric circles, the outermost of which\r\nis some 20 inches in diameter. After the lapse of a day or two the\r\nweb loses its adhesive property and a new one is made. In about six\r\nmonths the female _Epeira_ has completed her ten changes of skin, one\r\nof which takes place in the cocoon, and \"at the end of eight months\r\nthe spider is 2700 times as heavy as at its birth.\" This _Epeira_\r\nlives, we are told, for about eighteen months.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: The History and Habits of _Epeira aurelia_, in Annals\r\nand Mag of Nat. Hist. for June, 1865.]\r\n\r\nOne can scarcely contemplate the work of these architects and\r\nweavers, and especially of the trap-door makers, without being\r\ncarried away into the whirlpool of discussion which has so long raged\r\nround the word _instinct_.\r\n\r\nDo the young spiders build their first nest by instinct--that is to\r\nsay, independently of all teaching or personal experience--or do they\r\ncopy the nests in which they were hatched?\r\n\r\nWhat is wanting, however, is not discussion, of which we have had\r\nenough, but demonstration, and demonstration is hard to come by,\r\ndepending as it must upon careful and repeated experiment.\r\n\r\nIf it were practicable, and I have no reason to know that it is not,\r\nto rear spiders from the egg away from the nest, and then to cause\r\nthem to build in places where they should be perfectly at home and\r\nyet cut off from all communication with their kind, we might hope to\r\nlearn whether they can construct the characteristic nests of their\r\nspecies without ever having seen one.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace[88] shows that there is some reason to doubt whether\r\nbirds, which are so frequently said to build by instinct, would,\r\nunder parallel circumstances, construct the nest proper to their\r\nkind; and he states that birds brought up from the egg in cages do\r\nnot do so, nor do they even sing their parents' song without being\r\ntaught.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: Chapters on Instinct and on the Philosophy of Birds'\r\nNests, in his Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection.]\r\n\r\nOf course we can scarcely compare birds and spiders together, but we\r\nshould hesitate, in view of Mr. Wallace's expressed opinion as to the\r\nnest-building habits of the former, to assume that the latter are\r\nindependent of teaching and personal experience. It may very possibly\r\nbe so, but it has never been proved.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to gather together all the published records\r\nof the nests of spiders belonging to the sub-order _Territelariæ_,\r\nwith a view, if possible, to trace out the geographical range of the\r\nseveral types of structure. I have, however, met with but a small\r\namount of success, and even among the limited number of tolerably\r\ncomplete accounts of nests which I have been able to discover,\r\nseveral made no mention of the spider to which the nest belongs.\r\n\r\nProf. Ausserer[89] has enumerated 215 species of _Territelariæ_ as\r\nhaving been found in the world at large, but of this large number\r\nten only, as far as I have been able to learn, have been described\r\nin connexion with their nests, and eight of these belong to the\r\nMediterranean region.[90] To these we may now add two more, namely,\r\n_Nemesia meridionalis_, with its branched double-door nest, and _N.\r\nEleanora_ the builder of the unbranched double-door nest, thus making\r\ntwelve in all.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: In his monograph of _Territelariæ_ quoted above.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: I use this term in its widest sense, making it even\r\ninclude Morocco. A list of the species known to inhabit this region\r\nwill be found in Appendix C.]\r\n\r\nThree of the twelve, however, _Atypus piceus_, _A. Blackwallii_, and\r\n_Nemesia cellicola_,[91] do not appear to build true trap-doors, but\r\nonly a simple silk tube without any covering at the mouth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: See Appendix A, p. 141.]\r\n\r\nThe following tabular view will show to which of the four types of\r\ntrap-door nest those of the remaining nine spiders belong, and their\r\ngeographical distribution:--\r\n\r\nTRAP-DOOR SPIDERS WHICH BUILD\r\n\r\n  Nests of the cork type.\r\n\r\n    _Idiops syriacus_, Beirût.\r\n\r\n    _Cteniza fodiens (Ct.

(Cyrtocarenum) Ariana_, Naxos, Tinos.\r\n\r\n    _Nemesia cæmentaria_, South of France, Spain, Sardinia, Corsica,\r\n        Sicily, Algiers, and the var. _germanica_ from Wippach, near\r\n        Görz.\r\n\r\n[Nests, apparently of the true cork type, have also been found in\r\nAustralia, New Granada, India, and the island of Formosa, but their\r\noccupants are unknown.]\r\n\r\n  Nests of the single-door wafer type.\r\n\r\n    _Cteniza nidulans_, West Indies (and South America?)\r\n\r\n  Nests of the double-door branched type.\r\n\r\n    _Nemesia meridionalis_, Mentone, Cannes, and Sestri, near Genoa.\r\n\r\n  Nests of the double-door unbranched type.\r\n\r\n    _Nemesia Eleanora_, Mentone, and Cannes.\r\n\r\nAs far, therefore, as I know at present, the cork type of nest is the\r\nonly one which is widely spread, and which is constructed by spiders\r\nof more than one species. For, while the single-door wafer, and the\r\nbranched and unbranched double-door nests are each the work of one\r\nparticular spider, we see that nests of the cork type are made by\r\nspiders of six distinct species, belonging to at least three genera.\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain that a much larger number of spiders of\r\ndifferent kinds, though all probably members of the sub-order\r\n_Territelariæ_, construct nests of the cork type, for descriptions\r\nand specimens of trap-doors of this kind are brought from the most\r\ndistant parts of the globe. It is true that these specimens and\r\ndescriptions usually only show us the surface-door, but as far as our\r\npresent knowledge goes, we are led to suppose that a door of the\r\ncork type is always associated with a simple tube, in which there is\r\nno trace of a second door or valve, so that, judging of the unknown\r\nby the known, we conclude that nests which possess the characteristic\r\npeculiarity of a true cork door are true cork nests in other respects\r\nalso. Further research may possibly show that there are exceptions to\r\nthis generalization, but I do not at present know of any.\r\n\r\nI have seen Australian specimens of large trap-doors, of the cork\r\ntype, measuring from one to two inches across. In some of these the\r\ndoors were scarcely more than semicircular but very thick, and having\r\ntheir edges bevelled so as to correspond with the sloping margin of\r\nthe tube;[92] in others, found at Paramatta, and described to me by\r\nLady Parker as being tenanted by a black spider, the doors were said\r\nto be circular and much smaller, scarcely larger than a sixpence, and\r\nof the cork type.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Specimens of Australian nests may be seen in the cases\r\nat the British Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe upper portion of a nest from New Granada has been figured and\r\ndescribed by M. Victor Audouin,[93] which closely resembles that\r\ndrawn at Fig. A in Plate VII., p. 88, but the door is about a third\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Note sur la demeure d'une araignée maçonne de\r\nl'Amérique du Sud. Annales des Sciences Naturelles (Zoologie), tom.\r\nvii. tab. 3, p. 227-231.]\r\n\r\nI have also been assured that nests of the cork type are found in\r\nmany parts of India, and we have seen above that they are reported to\r\nbe common in the island of Formosa.\r\n\r\nPutting all this together, it will be seen that nests of this type\r\nare found all round the globe; in Formosa, India, Syria, the Grecian\r\nArchipelago, Italy, and the adjacent islands, Trieste, South France,\r\nSpain, Morocco, New Granada, and Australia; while the single-door\r\nwafer nest is only known at present in the West India islands;[94]\r\nthe branched double-door nest at Mentone, Cannes, and Pegli near\r\nGenoa, and [doubtfully] near Naples and in Ischia; and the unbranched\r\ndouble-door type at Mentone and Cannes alone. It is quite probable\r\nthat these three latter forms of nest will some day be found to\r\nhave a much wider range than that assigned to them here, but I can\r\nscarcely think it likely that they will ever be shown to claim the\r\nworld-wide distribution of the cork type. Supposing that these nests\r\nare eventually discovered in many widely distant localities, a very\r\ninteresting question will arise as to the specific characters of\r\nthe spiders which inhabit and construct them. Shall we then find,\r\nfor example, that nests of the unbranched double-door type are not\r\ntenanted and fabricated by _Nemesia Eleanora_ alone, as we have\r\nhitherto found to be the case, but by many other distinct species\r\nalso, each in its peculiar district?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: There is a nest exhibited in the Museum collection at\r\nthe Jardin des Plantes at Paris, marked \"Amérique du Sud,\" which is\r\nperhaps of this type.]\r\n\r\nThat is to say, will the type of nest remain the same while the\r\noccupants vary, as in the cork nests?\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we learn that these three types, the\r\nsingle-door wafer, the branched and unbranched double-door nests, are\r\nvery local, we shall be led to inquire into the probable causes of\r\nthis limitation.\r\n\r\nBut we must study much more closely the habits of these trap-door\r\nspiders, and the difficulties and dangers to which they are exposed,\r\nif we wish to appreciate fully the true meaning and intention of\r\nthe structure of their nests, and to find the clue to the difficult\r\nquestion why one type should be more frequently adopted than another.\r\nAbove all, we must discover what are their enemies, and how and when\r\nthey are most exposed to them. M. de Walckenaer gives an entertaining\r\naccount[95] of the enemies to which spiders generally are exposed,\r\nand of this the following list is an abstract.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: Histoire des Insectes Aptères (Suites à Buffon), vol.\r\ni. p. 172-7.]\r\n\r\nMany kinds of monkeys, squirrels, and several sorts of birds, as\r\nwell as lizards, tortoises, frogs, and toads prey upon spiders. A\r\nspecies of black sheep, found in the steppes of Asiatic Russia,\r\nunearths the tarantulas (Lycosa), and eats them. (\"Une espèce de\r\nbrebis noire, dans les steppes de la Russie asiatique, déterre les\r\ntarentules et les mange\"). In the East India Archipelago there\r\nis an entire genus of birds of the passerine order, which have\r\nbeen named \"Arachnoptères\" because the different species of which\r\nit is composed live exclusively on spiders. Besides these, the\r\ncentipede (_Scolopendra_), and the following Hymenopterous insects,\r\n_Philanthes_, _Sphex_, _Pompilus_, _Pimpla Ovivora_, and _P.\r\nArachnitor_ [which last lay their eggs in the eggs of spiders], carry\r\non perpetual hostilities against them.\r\n\r\nI have seen it stated that ants are among the worst enemies of\r\nspiders, driving their galleries through the silk tubes of the latter\r\nand devouring their eggs. Of this I have never seen any trace, and,\r\non the contrary, have on four occasions found the remains of ants'\r\nbodies at the bottom of the trap-door spiders' nests.\r\n\r\nI have but seldom detected any refuse in these nests, and this\r\naccords with what M. Erber tells us[96] of the care with which\r\n_Cteniza Ariana_, which he watched by moonlight in the island of\r\nTinos, carried away the empty bodies of the beetles, the juices of\r\nwhich had been sucked out, to a distance of some feet from its hole.\r\nIn October, 1872, however, I found a black layer of débris at the\r\nbottom of five nests of _Nemesia Eleanora_, and this was composed\r\nprincipally of the remains of insects, and among others of some\r\nrather large beetles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: A translation of these very interesting observations\r\nwill be found below in Appendix B.]\r\n\r\nAs far as I am aware, M. Erber is the only naturalist who has ever\r\nplaced any detailed observations on record as to the nocturnal habits\r\nof a trap-door spider in its native haunts; and we may learn from\r\nhim how we should watch these creatures, if we wish to discover the\r\nmanner in which they take their prey, and of what their prey consists.\r\n\r\nHe relates how he witnessed the capture, in the long low snare\r\nwhich _Cteniza Ariana_ spreads close to the ground, of two strong,\r\nnight-flying beetles (_Pimelia_ and _Cephalostenus_), and how these\r\nwere at once devoured, and their horny coats thrown away.\r\n\r\nMore observations of this kind are greatly wanted, as it is most\r\nimportant that we should know what are the principal sources of food\r\nupon which these spiders depend for their existence.\r\n\r\nIf we could answer the questions, what do they eat? and what do they\r\nfear? we should have advanced a long way towards resolving the larger\r\nproblem as to the causes which limit particular species to certain\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nI greatly envy those who are able to travel, and who have it in their\r\npower to investigate the habits of these creatures at several widely\r\nseparated points; for there seems every probability that other new\r\ntypes of nest remain to be detected in warm climates, some of which\r\nmay perhaps exceed those we have been here studying in beauty of\r\nworkmanship and adaptation; it is at least certain that an abundant\r\nharvest of interesting facts in the life history of trap-door spiders\r\nremains yet to be gathered in.\r\n\r\nIndeed it appears to me that we are only on the threshold of\r\ndiscoveries of this kind, and that the materials brought together in\r\nthe preceding pages may be considered as but a small sample of what\r\nmay be collected on the outermost edge of this great domain.\r\n\r\nI shall be satisfied if I have been able in the present little work,\r\nto hold the door sufficiently ajar to permit those who love nature\r\nand her ways to catch a glimpse of the wonders and beauties of the\r\nuntrodden land that lies beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n_Nemesia (Mygale) meridionalis_, Costa.[97]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Costa, Fauna del Regno di Napoli, Aracnidi (1861), p.\r\n14, tab. i. figs. 1-4. [Translation.]]\r\n\r\n\"M. fusco rufoque-flavicante, maculis obscurioribus, thorace\r\nradiatim, abdomine seriatim dispositis, subtus thorace rufescente,\r\nabdomine flavidulo, mandibulis spinarum serie unica, tarsis omnibus\r\nspinulosis.\"\r\n\r\n\"The cephalothorax oval, elongated and truncate in front, while the\r\nhead is smooth and bare, with a group of eight eyes, a little keeled\r\nin the middle; of a fulvous-brown colour, with ten rather dusky\r\nspots arranged in rays, and corresponding to the direction of the\r\neight legs (anche) and the two maxillæ. The mandibles are large,\r\nhorizontal at first, then curved downwards, making a quarter of a\r\ncircle, furnished with numerous hairs, especially on the inner side,\r\nand at the anterior extremity above there are mobile and rather long\r\nspines; below they are channelled, with six little teeth or spines\r\non the edge (rilievo) of the inner face, clothed with many bristling\r\nhairs, with which the outside is also covered, but without any teeth;\r\non the inner face they are flattened, so that they fit perfectly\r\nclose. The fang is strong, curved, acute, and black. The maxillæ\r\nare clothed with brown hairs almost as the legs are, and at their\r\nextremity, on the outer side, stand the long palpi, rather hairy\r\n(pelacciuti), terminated by a very short and simple little claw.\r\nThe sternal lip is very small and round. The abdomen oval, longer\r\nor shorter according to age, dusky ash in colour, spotted with\r\nbrown, and covered with short and depressed (rasicci) hairs. The\r\nbrown spots are disposed in slanting lines, placed obliquely to the\r\nmedian line, which is also brown; below it is somewhat lighter, and\r\nbecomes slightly yellow, increasingly so in the female as pregnancy\r\nadvances. The pulmonal sacs are always pale yellow, and involved in\r\nthe fold (tramezzati dalla ripiegatura). Between these, and within\r\nthe fold itself, the female sexual organ opens, consisting of a\r\ntransverse opening invisible to the naked eye, but clearly seen on\r\nusing a lens and removing the fold under which it is concealed, by\r\nmeans of the point of a scalpel or of a pin. The posterior extremity\r\nof the anus presents four spinnerets, of which the two upper are much\r\nthe longer, and composed of four easily seen joints, the lower very\r\nshort. The feet are moderate, and the longest are of the length of\r\nthe entire body when this is fully developed (quando è perfettamente\r\nsviluppato); of these the fourth pair are about a third longer\r\nthan the first, the third of about the same length as the second,\r\nwhich is the shortest of all. The tarsi of these are armed with two\r\nsmall curved claws, and the third and fourth joint with many long,\r\ndelicate, straight, and mobile spines, which in the first pair become\r\nfewer as they approach the last joint. The eyes are arranged in three\r\nlines, as they are represented in C, Plate I., Fig. 3, and of these\r\nthe two last of the posterior line are white and glistening, the\r\nothers brown.\r\n\r\n\"Our _Mygale_ lives in tubular cavities, or burrows, which she\r\nexcavates for herself in loose and friable soil, in walls made of\r\nvolcanic earth, in shady places, and for the most part turned to the\r\nnorth or to the west, seldom to the south--hence cool and rather\r\ndamp. The burrows do not exceed the length of a palm, eight lines at\r\ntheir widest part. For about the length of an inch the tube is funnel\r\nshaped, thence it continues of a nearly uniform magnitude. Its first\r\ndirection is almost horizontal, then it rises continually, turning\r\nto the right or left, and sometimes makes zigzags. As the tubes are\r\nexcavated in friable soil, she takes care to tapestry them inside\r\nwith the same glutinous material of which the other races make their\r\nweb, by means of which the burrows are made smooth on the inside, and\r\nto strengthen them in such a manner that even when the outer earthy\r\npart has become cracked, or been torn away by the action of the rain,\r\nthey remain firm and fit to conceal their inhabitant. I have often\r\nfound the tubes of web thus left exposed, as they are represented\r\nin Plate I., Fig. 4, situated in the cement of a wall, and among\r\n_Lycopodium denticulatum_, _Adiantum Capillus-Veneris_, _Marchantia\r\npolymorpha_, and other small plants. And it seems that the animal,\r\nperceiving the nature of the soil, takes care to reinforce the\r\nsilken case, so much the more as she finds the earth less firm, and\r\n_vice versâ_. So that in burrows excavated in solid ground, with\r\nthe exception of a little space close to the aperture, the nest is\r\nmerely smoothed and daubed; while sometimes the spider constructs a\r\ntube so strong that it supports itself even when deprived of all the\r\nearth, the animal having had the foresight to attach it along the\r\ncourse of the clefts of the rock, or to the cement of the pieces of\r\ntufa in the wall, as represented in Plate I. They have often also a\r\ndouble aperture, and the upper portions of the burrows converging,\r\nmeet and anastomose at about two inches distance. The aperture is\r\nclosed by a little door or valve (_a_), which, having its hinge in\r\nthe upper part and a little on one side, falls by its own weight, and\r\nfits itself exactly to the opening. The outer surface of the wicket\r\nis covered with earth, cemented by the glue of the spider, so that\r\nit is rendered imperceptible to common eyes, and the industrious\r\nlittle creature takes care to leave around the aperture a kind of\r\nrim, to which the door fitting closely, leaves no passage for any\r\nanimal, nor does it show its edges. At the bottom of its tube the\r\ncreature keeps her numerous offspring, and always stands herself as\r\nsentinel at the door, holding the wicket raised by means of the four\r\nanterior feet, and the palpi, curved extremities of which she inserts\r\nbetween the rim of the tube and of the door, as represented in _a'\r\nf_. Sometimes, however, they do not appear, but she leaves only the\r\nchink for observation, as one sees in _a_ of the same figure. Fig.\r\n2, at _c_, represents the aperture of an abandoned burrow, and at\r\n_d_ the raised door of another burrow, with its almost funnel-shaped\r\naperture. That which Sauvage, Olivier, and Latreille relate of her\r\nis not true--namely, that she remains at the bottom of the burrow,\r\nand runs to the door only when she sees it threatened, in order to\r\nkeep the door firmly closed. On the contrary, always standing at the\r\ndoor as sentinel, she leaves it as soon as she thinks it in danger,\r\nso that it can be raised without the least effort: but if you hold\r\nit a little raised without making any sign of movement, she turns\r\non her back, and comes out to draw it down with her feet, making\r\nall the efforts she can to conquer the obstacle. But if you take\r\nit away entirely, she turns down the edges to close the aperture\r\nas best she can, and that she does hurriedly, without waiting for\r\nnight. The light seems to offend her so much that, if exposed to the\r\nfull day, she remains so stupefied as to appear dead, nor does she\r\nmove even if shaken; on the contrary, she constantly stops still and\r\nholds herself with her feet pressed against her body. At last, if\r\nvery much disturbed, she runs quickly for some distance, till she\r\nfinds a place in which to hide her head, and from thence she does\r\nnot stir. I have observed that the burrows are always short when\r\nthe aperture is small, and increase in length as they augment in\r\ndiameter, which makes me conclude that it is not true that they begin\r\ntheir excavations from the base of the mother's tube, where I have\r\nnever found any communication with others. This spider is found in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Naples (ne' contorni della Capitale), on the\r\nCamaldoli, in the island of Ischia, where it lives near the sources\r\nof mineral waters, in Gaeta at the foot of the olive trees, among the\r\nstones in the ground, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\"Observation. The difference which distinguishes our _Mygale_ from\r\nthe _Sauvagesii_ consists, first, in the toothing of the mandibles,\r\nwhich is observable on one side only of the channel, and not on both;\r\nsecondly, in the tarsi all equally armed with spines, and not only\r\nthe four anterior ones; thirdly, in the colour of the thorax and\r\nthe abdomen, which is not uniform as is usual in the _Sauvagesii_.\r\nNevertheless, such differences might be in part climatic, which would\r\ncause our _Mygale_ to be considered as a mere variety of the same\r\nspecies, and the others might be the result of the different method\r\nof examining the parts, and of the goodness of the instruments.\"\r\n\r\nAt p. 19, in the _Fauna del Regno di Napoli_, M. Costa gives the\r\nfollowing account of the nest of _Nemesia cellicola_, which he\r\ndiscovered above San Martino in September, 1833:--\r\n\r\n\"Vive entro la polvere arida, nelle cavità oscure delle muraglie, e\r\npropriamente nelle così dette _Saettiere_, ove, col glutine suo, si\r\ncostruisce un tubo delicato e mobile, che ha cura di affidare nel suo\r\norigine a qualche corpo stabile nel fondo del muro, e che in terra\r\nnella polvere, aprendosi l'altro estremo sul piano inclinato dalla\r\npolvere stessa costituto.\"\r\n\r\nThis, with the exception of the words \"e che in terra nella polvere,\"\r\nwhich are unintelligible to me as they stand, and appear to want a\r\nverb, may be translated as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"She lives in the dry dust, in the obscure crevices of walls, and\r\nespecially in those which are called _Saettiere_ (loop-holed walls?),\r\nwhere she constructs a delicate and flexible tube with her viscid\r\nsecretion, and which she takes care to fasten at its commencement to\r\nsome solid body at the bottom of the wall, ... the other extremity\r\nopening on the inclined plane formed by the dust itself.\"\r\n\r\nWe may remark that there is here no mention of any door or\r\nconcealment at the mouth of the tube, and in this and some other\r\nrespects the nest of _Nemesia cellicola_ would appear to resemble the\r\nnest of _Atypus piceus_ from the neighbourhood of Paris. See above in\r\nthe text, p. 78.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\n_On the Habits of Cteniza Ariana._\r\n\r\nThe following is a free translation of an account read by M. Erber\r\nbefore the Botanico Zoological Association of Vienna,[98] of the\r\nvery curious observations which he made on _Cteniza Ariana_ when\r\ntravelling in the Grecian Archipelago.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Verhand. der k. k. zoologisch-botanischer Verein in\r\nWien, vol. xviii. (1868), p. 905.]\r\n\r\n\"On my return voyage [from Rhodes], I stayed for a fortnight in\r\nthe island of Tinos, and, among other things, I captured several\r\nspecimens of the so-called trap-door spider (Deckelspinne) _Cteniza\r\nAriana_, Walck., and with much trouble procured an entire tube and\r\ntrap-door of this creature.... I am thus enabled to exhibit to this\r\nhonourable assembly the complete nest of this creature, and the\r\nspider herself, with her eggs, preserved in alcohol, and can moreover\r\nadd some few words as to her habits.\r\n\r\n\"It needs some practice, as the specimen before you shows, to enable\r\none to discover the nest, as the door is always closed by day. I dug\r\nout several of these tubes, but failed to find either the remains of\r\nfood or excrement. So there was nothing for it but to devote a couple\r\nof nights to watch these creatures. With this view I selected a place\r\nwhere many spiders had excavated their tunnels, and availed myself of\r\na moonlight night for my observations.\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after nine o'clock the doors opened and the spiders came\r\nout, fastened back the trap-doors by means of threads to neighbouring\r\nblades of grass or little stones, then spun a snare about six inches\r\nlong by half an inch high, and afterwards returned quietly to their\r\nholes.\r\n\r\n\"I had so chosen my position that I could see three of these spiders\r\nat the same time. I now captured a specimen and put it into spirits,\r\nand in a short time saw entangled in the net of one of the remaining\r\nspiders a _Pimelia_, and of the other a _Cephalostenus_, both rather\r\nhard-lived, night-flying beetles, which were seized by the spiders,\r\nand the latter, after sucking out the juices, carried the empty\r\nbodies to a distance of several feet from their holes. All these\r\nevents happened in about three hours, after which time I allowed the\r\ntwo spiders to remain undisturbed, and returned to the house.\r\n\r\n\"Early next morning I revisited the spot, and then perceived that\r\nthese two spiders had entirely removed the net which they made the\r\npreceding night, but the entrance to the nest of the spider which\r\nI had captured still remained open, and I could clearly trace the\r\nshape of its snare, on which the heavy morning's dew lay. The upper\r\nthreads were isolated, but the snare became thicker as it approached\r\nthe ground. I found that these snares had, strange to relate, been\r\ngathered up by the two other spiders, fastened on to the door, and\r\nsmoothly spun over, and, on making a vertical section of the doors,\r\nwhich were nearly a quarter of an inch thick, I discovered that they\r\nwere composed of several layers.\r\n\r\n\"In the nests of several females I found eggs at the bottom of the\r\ntube, not placed in cocoons, but attached by separate threads. The\r\nyoung spiders when hatched are turned out from the asylum of their\r\nmother's nest; and I found these creatures when scarcely two lines\r\nlong already established in nests three inches deep, and furnished\r\nwith perfect trap-doors, of which facts the specimens I now lay\r\nbefore you are the evidence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\nSpecies of Territelariæ, enumerated by Professor Ausserer,[99]\r\nbelonging to Europe and the Mediterranean region, with synonyms, and\r\ntwo species which I have added in brackets:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Beiträge zur Kenntniss der Arachniden-Familie der\r\nTerritelariæ, in k. k. zool.-bot.

The females may usually\r\nbe found in their nests during the daytime (always in Europe?).\r\n\r\nLarge spiders should be killed, or at least stupefied with\r\nchloroform, before being put into spirit of wine. It is convenient to\r\nplace the specimens in glass test-tubes closed with corks, and filled\r\nwith pure spirit of wine, as they may then be examined through the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nWhen specimens of more than one species are placed in the same\r\ntube or bottle, it is well to distinguish each by a number written\r\nin pencil on a small strip of card fastened round the body with a\r\nslip-noose of thread.\r\n\r\nThe patterns on the abdomen and cephalothorax of the spiders are seen\r\nvery distinctly when the spiders are immersed in spirits of wine,\r\nand these frequently afford characters which aid in determining the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nM. Thorell, in the introduction to his work _On European\r\nSpiders_,[100] gives a detailed account of a method by which\r\nspecimens may be prepared for mounting in cabinets, by drying them\r\nwithin a glass tube held over a flame, but it would appear that, for\r\npurposes of study, specimens preserved in spirit of wine are far\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: Thorell (T.), On European Spiders, in Nova Acta Regiæ\r\nSociet. Scientiar. Upsaliensis, ser. 3, vol. viii. fasc. I. et II.\r\n(Upsala, 1871).]\r\n\r\nIt is very desirable to obtain characteristic portions of, or\r\nif possible entire nests, but where the tubes are long, this is\r\nextremely difficult to do satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nSome nests, preserved in the British Museum, have been coated with\r\nthin glue, and this appears to be of some use in binding the parts\r\ntogether. I find that by stuffing the tube full of cotton-wool,\r\nbefore attempting to remove the earth, the nest may sometimes be\r\nobtained in tolerably good condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nE.\r\n\r\n_The Nest of the Tarantula (Lycosa Tarentula)._\r\n\r\nAs it is of some interest to compare the burrow of the Tarantula\r\nwith the nest of its near allies the trap-door spiders, I give the\r\nfollowing _résumé_ of M. Dufour's observations:[101]--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: Quoted by M. Lucas, in his Histoire Nat. des Animaux\r\nCrustacés et Arachnides, p. 357.]\r\n\r\n\"_Lycosa Tarentula_ forms a cylindrical burrow in the earth, often\r\nmore than a foot long, and about one inch in diameter. At about four\r\nor five inches below the surface the perpendicular tube is bent\r\nhorizontally, and it is at this angle that the Tarantula watches for\r\nthe approach of enemies or prey.\r\n\r\n\"The external orifice of the burrow of the Tarantula is ordinarily\r\nsurmounted by a separately constructed tube, and which authors have\r\nnot hitherto mentioned; this tube, a true piece of architecture,\r\nrises to about an inch above the surface of the ground, and is\r\nsometimes as much as two inches in diameter, being thus larger than\r\nthe burrow itself. This tube is principally composed of fragments\r\nof wood fastened together with clayey earth, and so artistically\r\ndisposed one above the other that they form a scaffolding having\r\nthe shape of an upright column, of which the interior is a hollow\r\ncylinder.\"\r\n\r\nM. Dufour observes, however, that the exterior tube was not found in\r\nall the nests. In every case the tube was lined with silk throughout\r\nits whole length.\r\n\r\n\r\nF.\r\n\r\nThe following description is that given by Prof. Ausserer in his\r\nmonograph of _Territelariæ_,[102] of a male trap-door spider\r\nwhich was found at Nice, and named by Herr L. Koch _Nemesia\r\nManderstjernæ_. It is just possible, I think, that this male may in\r\nreality belong to _N. meridionalis_ [Costa-Cambr.], of which the\r\nfemale alone is at present known.[103] If this is the case, then the\r\nname _Manderstjernæ_ will have to be suppressed in favour of that of\r\n_meridionalis_. If not, we have yet to discover the female spider and\r\nnest of another species of _Nemesia_!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Beiträge zur Kenntniss der Arachniden-Familie der\r\nTerritelariæ, in Verhand. der k. k. zool.-bot. Gesellschaft in Wien\r\n(1871), vol. xxi. p. 170.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: Mr. Pickard-Cambridge regards this suggestion (that\r\n_N. Manderstjernæ_ may be the male of _N. meridionalis_) not\r\nimprobable.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Nemesia Manderstjernæ_, L. Koch.\r\n\r\n♂ Die genaue Beschreibung dieser hübschen Art ihrem Autor, Herrn\r\nDr. L. Koch überlassend, führen wir hier nur jene wesentlichen\r\nUnterscheidungsmerkmale an, welche diese Species von den verwandten\r\nauszeichnen.--Cephalothorax schön gerundet mit schmalem, mässig hohem\r\nKopfe.--Augenhügel hoch, nach vorn und hinten steil abfallend.--Die\r\nvordere und hintere Augenreihe bilden 2 nahezu parallele Curven,\r\nmit der Concavität nach vorn. Vordere Mittelaugen stehen so hoch,\r\ndass eine Gerade von ihrer Basis zu den Seitenaugen gezogen etwas\r\nüber denselben zu stehen käme, zugleich sind sie von einander\r\num ihren Radius und kaum weiter von den vorderen Seitenaugen\r\nentfernt. Augen der vorderen Reihe fast doppelt so gross als\r\ndie der hinteren.--Zähne des Rechens lang und spitz.--Palpen\r\nmässig lang, letztes und vorletztes Glied ähnlich bewaffnet wie\r\nbei _N. cellicola_.[104]--Bulbus birnförmig, mit etwas kurzer,\r\ndünner Spitze.--Alle Tarsen der Beine, ebenso Metatarsus I und\r\nII mit dünner Scopula, zugleich sind die Tarsen wehrlos.--Tibia\r\nI keilförmig verdickt, unten an der Spitze ein starker nach\r\noben und innen gebogener, spitzer Zahn, vor demselben ein oben\r\ngerade abgestutzter Höcker.--Schenkel oben und innen mit dunkelm\r\nLängsstreifen.--Cephalothorax 6·5^{mm}.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: Description of palpi of _N. cellicola_, p. 168:\r\n\"Palpen kurz, stark.

Koch.\r\n\r\n♂ Passing over the precise description of this pretty species by its\r\nauthor, Herr Dr. L. Koch, let us note here some of the essential\r\ncharacters which distinguish this species from its relations.\r\n_Cephalothorax_ fairly (schön) rounded, with small, moderately\r\nprominent head. Eye eminence (Augenhügel) prominent, steeply inclined\r\nin front and behind. The front and rear row of eyes form two nearly\r\nparallel curves with the concavity in front. The foremost central\r\neyes stand so high that a line (eine Gerade) drawn from their base to\r\nthe lateral eyes would pass just above them, although they are not\r\nseparated from the lateral eyes by a distance greater than that of\r\ntheir own radius. Eyes of front row almost twice as large as those of\r\nhind row. Teeth of rake (Rechens) long and sharp. _Palpi_ moderately\r\nlong, the last and penultimate joint armed as in _N. cellicola_.[105]\r\nBulb pear-shaped, with a rather shorter, more slender point. All the\r\ntarsi of the legs, and even the metatarsi I and II, with a slender\r\nscopula, although the tarsi are unarmed. Tibia I enlarged into a\r\nwedge-shape, (having) beneath the apex a stout pointed tooth bent\r\nupwards and inwards, in front of which (is) a truncated prominence\r\n(ein oben gerade abgestutzter Höcker). Femur (Schenkel) (having)\r\ndusky longitudinal stripes above within.--Cephalothorax 6·5^{mm}.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Description of palpi of _N. cellicola_:--_Palpi_,\r\nshort, strong. Femoral joint furnished with spines above; penultimate\r\njoint armed with four stout rather short spines above the apex, the\r\nterminal joint also having some very small spines. Bulb shortly\r\npear-shaped, running out into a fine, moderately long point, which is\r\nslender as a thread, and not split in front.]\r\n\r\nNice.\r\n\r\n\r\nG.\r\n\r\n_On Nemesia meridionalis and N. Eleanora, Captive in Company with\r\ntheir Young._\r\n\r\nI have tried the experiment of keeping specimens of _Nemesia\r\nmeridionalis_ and _N. Eleanora_ captive in flower-pots, partly\r\nfilled with earth and covered with gauze, but I have never been\r\nable to detect the least inclination on the part of either of these\r\nspiders to excavate a burrow in the earth.\r\n\r\nThinking that I might have better success if I were to place the\r\nmother spiders, together with their young, in captivity, I captured a\r\nfemale _N. meridionalis_ and _N. Eleanora_, each with its brood, and\r\nplaced them on moist earth in flower-pots under gauze. The result,\r\nhowever, was that the young spiders concealed themselves in the\r\ncrevices of the soil, while the mother spiders remained exposed.\r\n\r\nThe adult _N. meridionalis_ lived thus for twenty days (from the 7th\r\nto the 27th of November), capturing and killing flies with which I\r\nsupplied her, but she then suddenly died.\r\n\r\nAfter seventeen days' captivity the other species (_N. Eleanora_)\r\nbegan to cover a small surface of the gauze with a semi-transparent\r\nsubstance (which resembled varnish rather than silk), secreted from\r\nits spinners, and four days later it began to weave a cell; this\r\ncell took twelve days to complete, and finally assumed the shape of\r\na rudely-formed figure of 8, with a circular aperture at either end,\r\neach of which was kept open during the construction of the cell, and\r\nthen closed. The gauze itself, covered with silk, formed the ceiling\r\nof the cell, while the floor was made of silk attached to the earth,\r\nand the sides of strong and rather opaque silk.\r\n\r\nThis cell bore no resemblance to any portion of any trap-door\r\nnest that I have ever seen, and it is difficult to conceive how\r\nthe idea of such a structure presented itself to the spider. Its\r\noutline indeed had some likeness to the general outline of the\r\nspider herself, one loop of the figure 8 being rather smaller than\r\nthe other. The distance between the floor and the ceiling of this\r\nimpromptu cell was a little over half an inch, its width varying from\r\none inch in the broadest to eight lines in the narrowest part, while\r\nits length was an inch and a quarter.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the object which the spider had in view\r\nwas to construct a warm and secure retreat for the winter, and\r\naccordingly after having completed this chamber, she no longer made\r\nexcursions to catch the flies with which I supplied her, but remained\r\nself-immured in her cell.[106]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: My observations on the captive spider were still in\r\nprogress at the time of going to print, so that the above notes must\r\nbe considered as incomplete.]\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to discover whether any of the spiders of\r\nthis group (but which do not construct trap-door nests) pass the\r\nwinter in similar structures.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.\r\n\r\n_On the Structure of Cork Doors._\r\n\r\nIn order to test my theory to the effect that the trap-door nests are\r\nenlarged from time to time, and that the numbers of layers of silk in\r\nan undisturbed cork door should represent the number of enlargements\r\nwhich the nest has undergone, I examined the doors of twenty-eight\r\nnests of the cork type (all I believe of _N. cæmentaria_), in order\r\nto prove whether as a rule the larger cork doors do contain more\r\nlayers of silk than the small ones, as they should on this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThis is, I think, fairly established by the following table:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Comparative Table._\r\n\r\n  One cork door measuring 1     line across contained 1 layer of silk.\r\n  Four  \"  doors  \"       1-1/2 lines   \"             3 layers  \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       1-1/2         \"             2         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       1-3/4         \"             4         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       2             \"             5         \"\r\n  Two   \"  doors  \"       2-1/2         \"             6         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       2-1/2         \"             5         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       3             \"             8         \"\r\n  Two   \"  doors  \"       3-1/2         \"             5         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       3-1/2         \"             7         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       4             \"             7         \"\r\n  Two   \"  doors  \"       4-1/2         \"             8         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       4-1/2         \"             7         \"\r\n  Two   \"  doors  \"       5             \"             9         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       5             \"             5         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       5             \"             6         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       5             \"            13         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       5-1/2         \"             9         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       5-1/2         \"            10         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       5-1/2         \"            14         \"\r\n  One   \"  door   \"       6             \"            12         \"\r\n\r\nThe apparent exceptions to this rule, in which the larger doors have\r\nfewer layers than some of the smaller ones, may probably be accounted\r\nfor in the following manner.\r\n\r\nDuring the heavy rains and in times of drought flakes of earth often\r\nbecome detached from the sloping banks, and carry away the doors of\r\nsuch nests as are found in them.\r\n\r\nThis happens frequently, and the spiders hasten to repair the damage\r\nand spin new doors.\r\n\r\nBut I have found, on examining eight of these new doors, that, even\r\nin large nests,[107] they do not then contain more than three layers\r\nof silk; so that each time a nest of any size loses its door, the\r\nnumber of layers is greatly reduced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Of the eight doors in question the smallest measured\r\n3-1/2 lines across, and the largest 7 lines.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of six of these nests I had myself acted the part of the\r\nlandslip and removed the existing door. These original and apparently\r\nundisturbed doors measured 3-1/2, 4, 5, 5, 5, and 5 lines across, and\r\ncontained respectively 5, 7, 8, 13, 9 and 5 layers of silk; while\r\nof the equally large doors which replaced them five contained three\r\nlayers of silk only, and the remaining nest but a single layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.--HARVESTING ANTS.\r\n\r\n  Ælian on harvesting ants, 7-9.\r\n\r\n  Aldrovandus, radicle of seed gnawed by ants, 9.\r\n\r\n  Algiers, harvesters observed in, 52.\r\n\r\n  Aphides and cocci not sought by harvesting ants, 48.\r\n\r\n  Atta _barbara_, 15, &c.;\r\n    _barbara_ var., 16, 31, 63;\r\n    _barbata_, 12;\r\n    _cephalotes_, 13;\r\n    _diffusa_, 12 (note), 65;\r\n    _megacephala_, 16, working at night, 49;\r\n    _providens_, 12 (note), 65;\r\n    _rufa_, 12 (note), 64;\r\n    _structor_, 16, 29, 63, working at night, 49.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Battles of ants between different colonies of the same species, 37, 40;\r\n    with caterpillar, 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Capri, harvesting ants at, 68.\r\n\r\n  Captive ants, 42-49.\r\n\r\n  Crematogaster _scutellaris_, 62;\r\n    _sordidulus_, 63.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dispersal of seeds by means of ants, 4, 21, 53, 55.\r\n\r\n  Distribution of harvesting ants, 52, 57, 59.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Enemies of the ants, 56.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Formica _cruentata_, 37, 61;\r\n    _cursor_, 62;\r\n    _emarginata_, 61, working at night, 49;\r\n    _erratica_, 37, 62;\r\n    _fusca_, 51, 61;\r\n    _marginata_, 62;\r\n    _nigra_, 5 (note);\r\n    _nigerrima_, 52;\r\n    _viatica_, 52.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Galls found in ants' nests, 36.\r\n\r\n  Germination of seeds arrested by ants, 20, 25, 26, 40;\r\n    this fact mentioned by Aldrovandus, 9.\r\n\r\n  Granaries, structure of, 22, 23, 31, 32, 49, 54;\r\n    position of, 31;\r\n    contents of, 27;\r\n    time required to construct, 45.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Insects inhabiting ants' nests, 35, 36, 56.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jerdon (Dr.) on harvesting ants in India, 12, 64, 65.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Kirby and Spence, assertion that ants do not harvest in Europe, 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mistakes made by ants, 19, 37.\r\n\r\n  Mouth organs of ants, 48.\r\n\r\n  Myrmica _cæspitum_, 37, 51, 63.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Occasional harvesters, 51.\r\n\r\n  Œcodoma _cephalotes_, 13;\r\n    _diffusa_, 12 (note), 65;\r\n    _providens_, 12 (note), 65.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pheidole _megacephala_, 16, 50, 63, working at night, 49;\r\n    _pallidula_, 51, 63.\r\n\r\n  Pseudomyrma _rufo-nigra_, 67.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Radicle of germinating seeds gnawed off by ants, 20, 25, 26;\r\n    this fact mentioned by Aldrovandus, 9.\r\n\r\n  Rock nest, sandstone mined by ants, 32-35.\r\n\r\n  Rubbish heaps, materials which compose, 21, 22, 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sandstone mined by ants, the rock nests, 31-35.\r\n\r\n  Seeds, dispersal of, by means of ants, 4, 21, 53, 55;\r\n    tendency to germinate arrested, 24, 50;\r\n    eaten by ants, 46-48, 54.\r\n\r\n  Seed stores of ants used as food by natives of India, 67.\r\n\r\n  Spherical chamber found in ant's nest, 35.\r\n\r\n  Sykes (Lieut.-Col.) and Jerdon (Dr.) on harvesting ants in India, 12,\r\n    64, 65.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Winged males and females of Aph. _Structor_ and _Barbara_, 41.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.--TRAP-DOOR SPIDERS.\r\n\r\n  Atypus _Blackwallii_, 78.\r\n\r\n  Atypus _piceus_, 77;\r\n    nest of, 78.\r\n\r\n  Ausserer (A.), description of Nemesia _manderstjernæ_, 145.\r\n\r\n  Australia, trap-door spiders in, 114, 130.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Blackwall, on nests of Atypus _piceus_, 78 (note).\r\n\r\n  Blackwall, on the tarsi of certain spiders being furnished with a\r\n    viscous secretion, 87.\r\n\r\n  British representative of the sub-order Territelariæ, 77.\r\n\r\n  Browne (Patrick), on the trap-door spider of Jamaica, 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cambridge (Rev.
