And I should judge it needless, to trouble\r\nothers, or my self, with any thing of Preface: were it not that I can\r\nscarce doubt, but this Book will fall into the hands of some Readers, who\r\nbeing unacquainted with the difficulty of attempts of this nature, will\r\nthink itn strange that I should publish any thing about Colours, without a\r\nparticular Theory of them. But I dare expect that Intelligent and Equitable\r\nReaders will consider on my behalf: That the professed Design of this\r\nTreatise is to deliver things rather _Historical_ than _Dogmatical_, and\r\nconsequently if I have added divers new _speculative_ Considerations and\r\nhints, which perhaps may afford no despicable Assistance, towards the\r\nframing of a solid and comprehensive Hypothesis, I have done at least as\r\nmuch as I promis'd, or as the nature of my undertaking exacted. But another\r\nthing there is, which if it should be objected, I fear I should not be able\r\nso easily to answer it, and that is; That in the following treatise\r\n(especially in the Third part of it) the Experiments might have been better\r\nMarshall'd, and some of them deliver'd in fewer words. For I must confess\r\nthat this Essay was written to a private Friend, and that too, by snatches,\r\nat several times, and places, and (after my manner) in loose sheets, of\r\nwhich I oftentimes had not all by me that I had already written, when I was\r\nwriting more, so that it needs be no wonder if all the Experiments be not\r\nrang'd to the best Advantage, and if some connections and consecutions of\r\nthem might easily have been mended. Especially since having carelessly laid\r\nby the loose Papers, for several years after they were written, when I came\r\nto put them together to dispatch them to the Press, I found some of those I\r\nreckon'd upon, to be very unseasonably wanting. And to make any great\r\nchange in the order of the rest, was more than the Printers importunity,\r\nand that, of my own avocations (and perhaps also considerabler\r\nsolicitations) would permit. But though some few preambles of the\r\nparticular Experiments might have (perchance) been spar'd, or shorten'd, if\r\nI had had all my Papers under my View at once; Yet in the most of those\r\nIntroductory passages, the Reader will (I hope) find hints, or\r\nAdvertisements, as well as Transitions. If I sometimes seem to insist long\r\nupon the circumstances of a Tryall, I hope I shall be easily excused by\r\nthose that both know, how nice divers experiments of Colours are, and\r\nconsider that I was not barely to _relate_ them, but so as to teach a young\r\nGentleman to make them. And if I was not sollicitous, to make a nicer\r\ndivision of the whole Treatise, than into three parts, whereof the One\r\ncontains some Considerations about Colours in general. The Other exhibits a\r\nspecimen of an Account of particular Colours, Exemplifi'd in Whiteness and\r\nBlackness. And the Third promiscuous Experiments about the remaining\r\nColours (especially Red) in order to a Theory of them. If, I say, I\r\ncontented my self with this easie Division of my Discourse, it was perhaps\r\nbecause I did not think it so necessary to be Curious about the Method or\r\nContrivance of a Treatise, wherein I do not pretend to present my Reader\r\nwith a compleat Fabrick, or so much as Modell; but only to bring in\r\nMaterials proper for the Building; And if I did not well know how Ingenious\r\nthe Curiosity and Civility of Friends makes them, to perswade Men by\r\nspecious allegations, to gratifie their desires; I should have been made to\r\nbelieve by persons very well qualify'd to judge of matters of this nature,\r\nthat the following Experiments will not need the addition of accurate\r\nMethod and speculative Notions to procure Acceptance for the Treatise that\r\ncontains them: For it hath been represented, That in most of them, as the\r\nNovelty will make them surprizing, and the Quickness of performance, keep\r\nthem from being tedious; so the sensible changes, that are effected by\r\nthem, are so manifest, so great, and so sudden, that scarce any will be\r\ndispleased to see them, and those that are any thing Curious will scarce be\r\nable to see them, without finding themselves excited, to make Reflexions\r\nupon Them. But though with me, who love to measure Physical things by\r\ntheir _use_, not their _strangeness_, or _prettiness_, the partiality of\r\nothers prevails not to make me over value these, or look upon them in\r\nthemselves as other than Trifles: Yet I confess, that ever since I did\r\ndivers years ago shew some of them to a Learned Company of _Virtuosi_: so\r\nmany persons of differing Conditions, and ev'n Sexes, have been Curious to\r\nsee them, and pleas'd not to Dislike them, that I cannot Despair, but that\r\nby complying with those that urge the Publication of them, I may both\r\ngratifie and excite the Curious, and lay perhaps a Foundation whereon\r\neither others or my self may in time superstruct a substantial theory of\r\nColours. And if _Aristotle_, after his Master _Plato_, have rightly\r\nobserv'd Admiration to be the _Parent of Philosophy_, the wonder, some of\r\nthese Trifles have been wont to produce in all sorts of Beholders, and the\r\naccess they have sometimes gain'd ev'n to the Closets of Ladies, seem to\r\npromise, that since the subject is so pleasing, that the Speculation\r\nappears as Delightful! as Difficult, such easie and recreative Experiments,\r\nwhich require but little time, or charge, or trouble in the making, and\r\nwhen made are sensible and surprizing enough, may contribute more than\r\nothers, (far more important but as much more difficult) to recommend those\r\nparts of Learning (Chymistry and Corpuscular Philosophy) by which they have\r\nbeen produc'd, and to which they give Testimony ev'n to such kind of\r\npersons, as value a pretty Trick more than a true Notion, and would scarce\r\nadmit Philosophy, if it approach'd them in another Dress: without the\r\nstrangeness or endearments of pleasantness to recommend it. I know that I\r\ndo but ill consult my own Advantage in the consenting to the Publication of\r\nthe following Treatise: For those things, which, whilst men knew not how\r\nthey were perform'd, appear'd so strange, will, when the way of making\r\nthem, and the Grounds on which I devis'd them, shall be Publick, quickly\r\nlose all that their being _Rarityes_, and their _being thought Mysteries_,\r\ncontributed to recommend them. But 'tis fitter for Mountebancks than\r\nNaturalis to desire to have their discoverys rather admir'd than\r\nunderstood, and for my part I had much rather deserve the thanks of the\r\nIngenious, than enjoy the Applause of the Ignorant. And if I can so farr\r\ncontribute to the discovery of the nature of Colours, as to help the\r\nCurious to it, I shall have reach'd my End, and sav'd my self some Labour\r\nwhich else I may chance be tempted to undergo in prosecuting that subect,\r\nand Adding to this Treatise, which I therefore call a _History_, because it\r\nchiefly contains matters of fact, and which History the Title declares me\r\nto look upon but as _Begun_: Because though that above a hundred, not to\r\nsay a hundred and fifty Experiments, (some loose, and others interwoven\r\namongst the discourses themselves) may suffice to give a _Beginning_ to a\r\nHistory not hitherto, that I know, begun, by any; yet the subject is so\r\nfruitfull, and so worthy, that those that are Curious of these Matters will\r\nbe farr more wanting to themselves than I can suspect, if what I now\r\npublish prove any more than a _Beginning_. For, as I hope my Endeavours may\r\nafford them some assistance towards this work, so those Endeavours are much\r\ntoo Vnfinish'd to give them any discouragement, as if there were little\r\nleft for others to do towards the History of Colours.\r\n\r\nFor (first) I have been willing to leave unmention'd the _most part_ of\r\nthose Phænomena of Colours, that Nature presents us of her own accord,\r\n(that is, without being guided or over-ruld by man) such as the different\r\nColours that several sorts of Fruites pass through before they are\r\nperfectly ripe, and those that appear upon the fading of flowers and\r\nleaves, and the putrifaction (and its several degrees) of fruits, &c.\r\ntogether with a thousand other obvious Instances of the changes of colours.\r\nNor have I _much_ medled with those familiar Phænomena wherein man is not\r\nan Idle spectator; such as the Greenness produc'd by salt in Beef much\r\npowder'd, and the Redness produc'd in the shells of Lobsters upon the\r\nboyling of those fishes; For I was willing to leave the _gathering_ of\r\n_Observations_ to those that have not the Opportunity to _make\r\nExperiments_. And for the same Reasons, among others, I did purposly omit\r\nthe Lucriferous practise of Trades-men about colours; as the ways of\r\nmaking Pigments, of Bleanching wax, of dying Scarlet, &c. though to divers\r\nof them I be not a stranger, and of some I have myself made Tryall.\r\n\r\nNext; I did purposely pass by divers Experiments of other Writers that I\r\nhad made Tryall of (and that not without registring some of their Events)\r\nunless I could some way or other improve them, because I wanted leasure to\r\ninsert them, and had thoughts of prosecuting the work once begun of laying\r\ntogether those I had examin'd by themselves in case of my not being\r\nprevented by others diligence. So that there remains not a little, among\r\nthe things that are already published, to imploy those that have a mind to\r\nexercise themselves in repeating and examining them. And I will not\r\nundertake, that _none_ of the things deliver'd, ev'n in this Treatise,\r\nthough never so faithfully set down, may not prove to be thus farr of this\r\nSort, as to afford the Curious somewhat to add about them. For I remember\r\nthat I have somewhere in the Book it self acknowledged, that having written\r\nit by snatches, partly in the Counntrey, and partly at unseasonable times\r\nof the year, when the want of fit Instruments, and of a competent variety\r\nof flowers, salts, Pigments, and other materials made me leave some of the\r\nfollowing Experiments, (especialy those about Emphatical Colours) far more\r\nunfinish'd than they should have been, if it had been as easie for me to\r\n_supply_ what was wanting to compleat them, as to _discern_. Thirdly to\r\navoyd discouraging the young Gentleman I call Pyrophilus, whom the less\r\nFamiliar, and more Laborious operations of Chymistry would probably have\r\nfrighted, I purposely declin'd in what I writ to him, the setting down any\r\nNumber of such Chymicall Experiments, as, by being very elaborate or\r\ntedious, would either require much skill, or exercise his patience. And yet\r\nthat this sort of Experiments is exceedingly Numerous, and might more than\r\na little inrich the History of Colours, those that are vers'd in Chymical\r\nprocesses, will, I presume, easily allow me.\r\n\r\nAnd (Lastly) for as much as I have occasion more than once in my several\r\nWritings to treat either porposely or incidentally of matters relating to\r\nColours; I did not, perhaps, conceive my self oblig'd, to deliver in one\r\nTreatise _all_ that I would say concerning that subject.\r\n\r\nBut to conclude, by summing up what I would say concerning what I _have_\r\nand what I _have not_ done, in the following Papers; I shall not (_on the\r\none side_) deny, that considering that I pretended not to write an accurate\r\nTreatise of Colours, but an Occasional Essay to acquaint a private friend\r\nwith what then occurrd to me of the things I had thought or try'd\r\nconcerning them; I might presume I did enough for once, if I did clearly\r\nand faithfully set down, though not _all_ the Experiments I could, yet at\r\nleast such a variety of them, that an attentive Reader that shall consider\r\nthe Grounds on which they have been made, and the hints that are purposely\r\n(though dispersedly) couched in them, may easily _compound_ them, and\r\notherwise _vary_ them, so as very much to increase their Number. And yet\r\n(_on the other side_) I am so sensible both of how much I have, either out\r\nof necessity or choice, left undone, and of the fruitfullness of the\r\nsubject I have begun to handle; that though I had performed far more then\r\n'tis like many Readers will judge I have, I should yet be very free to let\r\nthem apply to my Attempts that of _Seneca_, where having spoken of the\r\nStudy of Natures Mysteries, and Particularly of the Cause of Earth-Quakes,\r\nhe subjoins.[1] _Nulla res consummata est dum incipit.

Concerning which I cannot but give this\r\nadvertisement to the Reader, that I have heard the Author express himself,\r\nthat it would not surprise him, if it should happen to be objected, that\r\nsome of these Experiments have been already published, partly by Chymists,\r\nand partly by two or three very fresh Writers upon other Subjects. And\r\nthough the number of these Experiments be but very small, and though they\r\nbe none of the considerablest, yet it may on this occasion be further\r\nrepresented, that it is easie for our Author to name several men, (of whose\r\nnumber I can truly name my self) who remember either their having seen him\r\nmake, or their having read, his Accounts of the Experiments delivered in\r\nthe following Tract several years since, and long before the publication of\r\nthe Books, wherein they are mentioned. Nay in divers passages (where he\r\ncould do it without any great inconvenience) he hath struck out\r\nExperiments, which he had tryed many years ago, because he since found them\r\ndivulged by persons from whom he had not the least hint of them; which yet\r\nis not touched, with design to reflect upon any Ingenious Man, as if he\r\nwere a Plagiary: For, though our Generous Author were not reserved enough\r\nin showing his Experiments to those that expressed a Curiosity to see them\r\n(amongst whom a very Learned Man hath been pleased publickly to acknowledge\r\nit several years ago[2]; yet the same thing may be well enough lighted on\r\nby persons that know nothing of one another. And especially Chymical\r\nLaboratories may many times afford the same _Phænomenon_ about Colours to\r\nseveral persons at the same or differing times. And as for the few\r\n_Phænomena_ mentioned in the same Chymical writers, as well as in the\r\nfollowing Treatise, our Author hath given an account, why he did not\r\ndecline rejecting them, in the Anotations upon the 47th Experiment of the\r\nthird part. Not here to mention, what he elsewhere saith, to shew what use\r\nmay be Justifiably made of Experiments not of his own devising by a writer\r\nof Natural History, if, what he employes of others mens, be well examined\r\nor verified by himself.\r\n\r\n  [2] He that desires more instances of this kind and matter, that\r\n  according to this doctrine may much help the Theory of colours, and\r\n  particularly the force both of Sulphureous and volatile, is likewise of\r\n  Alcalizate and Acid Salts, and in what particulars, Colours likely depend\r\n  not in the causation from any Salt at all, may beg his information from\r\n  M. Boyle who hath some while since honoured me with the sight of his\r\n  papers concerning this subject, containing many excellent experiments,\r\n  made by him for the Elucidation of this doctrine, &c Dr. R. Sharrock in\r\n  his ingenious and usefull History of the Propagation and Improvement of\r\n  Vegetables, published in the yeare 1660.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, this Treatise is such, that there needs no other\r\ninvitation to peruse it, but that tis composed by one of the Deepest & Most\r\nindefatigable searchers of Nature, which, I think the World, as far as I\r\nknow it, affords. For mine own part, I feel a Secret Joy within me, to see\r\nsuch beginings upon such _Themes_, it being demonstratively true, _Mota\r\nfacilius moveri_, which causeth me to entertain strong hopes, that this\r\nIllustrious _Virtuoso_ and Restless Inquirer into Nature's Secrets will not\r\nstop here, but go on and prosper in the Disquisition or the other principal\r\nColours, _Green, Red_, and _Yellow_. The Reasoning faculty set once afloat,\r\nwill be carried on, and that with ease, especially, when the productions\r\nthereof meet, as they do here, with so greedy an Entertainment at home and\r\nabroad. I am confident, that the ROYAL SOCIETY, lately constituted by his\r\nMOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY _for improving Natural knowledge_, will Judge it\r\ntheir interest to exhort our Author to the prosecution of this Argument,\r\nconsidering, how much it is their design and business to accumulate a good\r\nstock of such accurate Observations and Experiments, as may afford them and\r\ntheir Offpring genuine Matter to raise a Masculine Philosophy upon, whereby\r\nthe Mind of Man may be enobled with the Knowledge of solid Truths, and the\r\nLife of Man benefited with ampler accommodations, than it hath been\r\nhitherto.\r\n\r\nOur Great Author, one of the Pillars of that Illustrious Corporation, is\r\nconstantly furnishing large _Symbola_'s to this work, and is now falln, as\r\nyou see, upon so comprehensive and important a theme, as will, if insisted\r\non and compleated, prove one of the considerablest peeces of that\r\nstructure. To which, if he shall please to add his Treatise of _Heat_ and\r\n_Flame_, as he is ready to publish his Experimental Accounts of _Cold_, I\r\nesteem, the World will be obliged to Him for having shewed them both the\r\n_Right_ and _Left Hand_ of Nature, and the Operations thereof.\r\n\r\nThe considering Reader will by this very Treatise see abundant cause to\r\nsollicit the Author for more; sure I am, that of whatever of the\r\nProductions of his Ingeny comes into _Forein parts_ (where I am happy in\r\nthe acquaintance of many intelligent friends) is highly valued; And to my\r\nknowledge, there are those among the French, that have lately begun to\r\nlearn English, on purpose to enable themselves to read his Books, being\r\nimpatient of their Traduction into Latin. If I durst say all, I know of the\r\nElogies received by me from abroad concerning Him, I should perhaps make\r\nthis Preamble too prolix, and certainly offend the modesty of our Author.\r\n\r\nWherefore I shall leave this, and conclude with desiring the Reader, that\r\nif he meet with other faults besides those, that the Errata take notice of\r\n(as I believe he may) he will please to consider both the weakness of the\r\nAuthors eyes, for not reviewing, and the manifold Avocations of the\r\nPublisher for not doing his part; who taketh his leave with inviting those,\r\nthat have also considered this Nice subject experimentally, to follow the\r\nExample of our Noble Author, and impart such and the like performances to\r\nthe now very inquisitive world. _Farewell._\r\n\r\n_H.

I.\r\n\r\n1 I have seen you so passionately addicted, _Pyrophilus_ to the delightful\r\nArt of Limning and Painting, that I cannot but think my self obliged to\r\nacquaint you with some of those things that have occurred to mee concerning\r\nthe changes of Colours. And I may expect that I shall as well serve the\r\n_Virtuosi_ in general, as gratifie you in particular, by furnishing a\r\nperson, who, I hope, will both improve my Communications, and communicate\r\nhis Improvements, with such Experiments and Observations as may both invite\r\nyou to enquire seriously into the Nature of Colours, and assist you in the\r\nInvestigation of it. This being the principal scope of the following Tract,\r\nI should do that which might prevent my own design, if I should here\r\nattempt to deliver you an accurate and particular Theory of Colours; for\r\nthat were to present you with what I desire to receive from you; and, as\r\nfarr as in mee lay, to make that study needless, to which I would engage\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n2 Wherefore my present work shall be but to divert and recreate, as well as\r\nexcite you by the delivery of matters of fact, such as you may for the most\r\npart try with much _ease_, and possibly not without some _delight_: And\r\nlest you should expect any thing of Elaborate or Methodical in what you\r\nwill meet with here, I must confess to you before-hand, that the seasons I\r\nwas wont to chuse to devise and try Experiments about Colours, were those\r\ndaies, wherein having taken Physick, and finding my self as unfit to\r\nspeculate, as unwilling to be altogether idle, I chose this diversion, as a\r\nkind of Mean betwixt the one and the other. And I have the less scrupled to\r\nset down the following Experiments, as some of them came to my mind, and as\r\nthe Notes wherein I had set down the rest, occurr'd to my hands, that by\r\ndeclining a Methodical way of delivering them, I might leave you and my\r\nself the greater liberty and convenience to add to them, and transpose them\r\nas shall appear expedient.\r\n\r\n3 Yea, that you may not think mee too reserv'd, or look upon an Enquiry\r\nmade up of meer Narratives, as somewhat jejune, am content to _premise_ a\r\nfew considerations, that now offer themselves to my thoughts, which relate\r\nin a more general way, either to the Nature of Colours, or to the study of\r\nit. And I shall _insert_ an _Essay_, as well Speculative as Historical, of\r\nthe Nature of Whiteness and Blackness, that you may have a _Specimen_ of\r\nthe History of Colours, I have sometimes had thoughts of; and if you\r\ndislike not the Method I have made use of, I hope, you, and some of the\r\n_Virtuosi_, your friends, may be thereby invited to go thorow with _Red,\r\nBlew, Yellow_, and the rest of the particular Colours, as I have done with\r\n_White_ and _Black_, but with farr more sagacity and success. And if I can\r\ninvite Ingenious men to undertake such Tasks, I doubt not but the Curious\r\nwill quickly obtain a better Account of Colours, than as yet we have, since\r\nin our Method the Theorical part of the Enquiry being attended, and as it\r\nwere interwoven with the Historical, whatever becomes of the disputable\r\nConjectures, the Philosophy of Colours will be promoted by the indisputable\r\nExperiments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n1 To come then in the first place to our more general Considerations, I\r\nshall begin with saying something as to the Importance of examining the\r\nColours of Bodies. For there are some, especially _Chymists_, who think,\r\nthat a considerable diversity of Colours does constantly argue an equal\r\ndiversity of Nature, in the Bodies wherein it is conspicuous; but I confess\r\nI am not altogether of their mind; for not to mention changeable Taffaties,\r\nthe blew and golden necks of Pidgeons, and divers Water-fowl, Rainbows\r\nNatural and Artificial, and other Bodies, whose Colours the Philosophers\r\nhave been pleased to call not Real, but Apparent and Phantastical; not to\r\ninsist on these, I say, (for fear of needlesly engaging in a Controversie)\r\nwe see in Parrots, Goldfinches, and divers other Birds, not only that the\r\ncontiguous feathers which are probably as near in properties as place, are\r\nsome of them Red, and others White, some of them Blew, & others Yellow,\r\n_&c._ but that in the several parts of the self-same feather there may\r\noften be seen the greatest disparity of Colours; and so in the leaves of\r\nTulips, July-flowers, and some other Vegetables the several leaves, and\r\neven the several parts of the same leaf, although no difference have been\r\nobserved in their other properties, are frequently found painted with very\r\ndifferent Colours. And such a variety we have much more admired in that\r\nlovely plant which is commonly, and not unjustly call'd the _Marvayl of\r\nPeru_; for of divers scores of fine Flowers, which in its season that gaudy\r\nPlant does almost daily produce, I have scarce taken notice of any two that\r\nwere dyed perfectly alike. But though _Pyro_: such things as these, among\r\nothers, keep mee from daring to affirm, that the Diversity and change of\r\nColours does _alwaies_ argue any great difference or alteration, betwixt,\r\nor in, the Bodies, wherein it is to be discerned, yet that _oftentimes_ the\r\nAlteration of Colours does signifie considerable Alterations in the\r\ndisposition of parts of Bodies, may appear in the Extraction of Tinctures,\r\nand divers other Chymical Operations, wherein the change of Colours is the\r\nchief, and sometimes the only thing, by which the Artist regulates his\r\nproceeding, and is taught to know when 'tis seasonable for him to leave\r\noff. Instances of this sort are more obvious in divers sorts of fruits, as\r\nCherries, Plums, &c. wherein, according as the Vegetable sap is sweetned,\r\nor otherwise ripened, by passing from one degree to another of Maturation,\r\nthe external part of the fruit passes likewise from one to another Colour.\r\nBut one of the noblest Instances I have met with of this kind, is not so\r\nobvious; and that is the way of tempering Steel to make Gravers, Drills,\r\nSprings, and other Mechanical Instruments, which we have divers times both\r\nmade Artificers practise in our presence, and tryed our selves, after the\r\nfollowing manner, First, the slender Steel to be tempered is to be hardened\r\nby heating as much of it as is requisite among glowing Coals, till it be\r\nglowing hot, but it must not be quenched assoon as it is taken from the\r\nfire (for that would make it too brittle, and spoil it) but must be held\r\nover a bason of water, till it descend from a White heat to a Red one,\r\nwhich assoon as ever you perceive, you must immediately quench as much as\r\nyou desire to harden in the cold water. The Steel thus hardened, will, if\r\nit be good, look somewhat White and must be made bright at the end, that\r\nits change of Colours may be there conspicuous; and then holding it so in\r\nthe flame of a Candle, that the bright end may be, for about half an inch,\r\nor more, out of the flame, that the smoak do not stain or sully the\r\nbrightness of it, you shall after a while see that clean end, which is\r\nalmost contiguous to the flame, pass very nimbly from one Colour to\r\nanother, as from a brighter Yellow, to a deeper and reddish Yellow, which\r\nArtificers call a _sanguine_, and from that to a fainter first, and then a\r\na deeper Blew. And to bring home this Experiment to our present purpose, it\r\nis found by daily Experience, that each of these succeeding Colours argue\r\nsuch a change made in the texture of the Steel, that if it be taken from\r\nthe flame, and immediately quenched in the tallow (whereby it is setled in\r\nwhatever temper it had before) when it is Yellow, it is of such a hardness\r\nas makes it fit for Gravers Drills, and such like tools; but if it be kept\r\na few minutes longer in the flame till it grow Blew, it becomes much\r\nsofter, and unfit to make Gravers for Metalls, but fit to make Springs for\r\nWatches, and such like Instruments, which are therefore commonly of that\r\nColour; and if the Steel be kept in the flame, after that this deep Blew\r\nhath disclosed it self, it will grow so soft, as to need to be new hardened\r\nagain, before it can be brought to a temper, fit for Drills or Penknives.\r\nAnd I confess _Pyro._ I have taken much pleasure to see the Colours run\r\nalong from the parts of the Steel contiguous to the flame, to the end of\r\nthe Instrument, and succeed one another so fast, that if a man be not\r\nvigilant, to thrust the Steel into the tallow at the very nick of time, at\r\nwhich it has attain'd its due Colour, he shall miss of giving his tool the\r\nright temper. But because the flame of a Candle is offensive to my weak\r\neyes, and because it is apt to either black or sully the contiguous part of\r\nthe Steel which is held in it, and thereby hinder the change of Colours\r\nfrom being so long and clearly discern'd, I have sometimes made this\r\nExperiment by laying the Steel to be tempered upon a heated bar of Iron,\r\nwhich we finde also to be employ'd by some Artificers in the tempering of\r\nsuch great Instruments, as are too big to be soon heated sufficiently by\r\nthe flame of a Candle. And you may easily satisfie your self _Pyro_: of the\r\ndiffering hardness and toughness, which is ascribed to Steel temper'd at\r\ndifferent Colours, if you break but some slender wires of Steel so\r\ntemper'd, and observe how they differ in brittleness, and if with a file\r\nyou also make tryal of their various degrees of hardness.\r\n\r\n2 But _Pyrophilus_, I must not at present any further prosecute the\r\nConsideration of the importance of Experiments about Colours, not only\r\nbecause you will in the following papers finde some instances, that would\r\nhere be presented you out of their due place, of the use that may be made\r\nof such Experiments, in discovering in divers bodies, what kind the salt\r\nis, that is predominant in them; but also because a speculative Naturalist\r\nmight justly enough allege, that as Light is so pleasing an object, as to\r\nbe well worth our looking on, though it discover'd to us nothing but its\r\nself; so modifi'd Light called Colour, were worth our contemplation, though\r\nby understanding its Nature we should be taught nothing else. And however,\r\nI need not make either you or my self excuses for entertaining you on the\r\nsubject I am now about to treat of, since the pleasure _Pyro_: takes in\r\nmixing and laying on of Colours, will I presume keep him, and will (I am\r\nsure) keep mee from thinking it troublesome to set down, especially after\r\nthe tedious processes (about other matters) wherewith I fear I may have\r\ntyr'd him, some easie, and not unpleasant Experiments relating to that\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n3 But, before we descend to the more particular considerations, we are to\r\npresent you concerning Colours, I presume it will be seasonable to propose\r\nat the very entrance a Distinction; the ignorance or neglect of which,\r\nseems to mee to have frequently enough occasioned either mistakes or\r\nconfusion in the Writings of divers Modern Philosophers; for Colour may be\r\nconsidered, either as it is a quality residing in the body that is said to\r\nbe coloured, or to modifie the light after such or such a manner; or else\r\nas the Light it self, which so modifi'd, strikes upon the organ of sight,\r\nand so causes that Sensation which we call Colour; and that this latter may\r\nbe look'd upon as the more proper, though not the usual acception of the\r\nword Colour, will be made probable by divers passages in the insuing part\r\nof our discourse; and indeed it is the Light it self, which after a certain\r\nmanner, either mingled with shades, or some other waies troubled, strikes\r\nour eyes, that does more immediately produce that motion in the organ, upon\r\nwhose account men say they see such or such a Colour in the object; yet,\r\nbecause there is in the body that is said to be coloured, a certain\r\ndisposition of the superficial particles, whereby it sends the Light\r\nreflected, or refracted, to our eyes thus and thus alter'd, and not\r\notherwise, it may also in some sense be said, that Colour depends upon the\r\nvisible body; and therefore we shall not be against that way of speaking of\r\nColours that is most used among the Modern Naturalists, provided we be\r\nallowed to have recourse when occasion shall require to the premis'd\r\ndistinction, and to take the more immediate cause of Colour to be the\r\nmodifi'd Light it self, as it affects the Sensory; though the disposition\r\nalso of the colour'd body, as that modifies the Light, may be call'd by\r\nthat name Metonimically (to borrow a School term) or Efficiently, that is\r\nin regard of its turning the Light, that rebounds from it, or passes thorow\r\nit, into this or that particular Colour.\r\n\r\n4 I know not whether I may not on this occasion add, that Colour is so far\r\nfrom being an Inherent quality of the object in the sense that is wont to\r\nbe declar'd by the Schools, or even in the sense of some Modern Atomists,\r\nthat, if we consider the matter more attentively, we shall see cause to\r\nsuspect, if not to conclude, that though Light do more immediately affect\r\nthe organ of sight, than do the bodies that send it thither, yet Light it\r\nself produces the sensation of a Colour, but as it produces such a\r\ndeterminate kind of local motion in some part of the brain; which, though\r\nit happen most commonly from the motion whereinto the slender strings of\r\nthe _Retina_ are put, by the appulse of Light, yet if the like motion\r\nhappen to be produc'd by any other cause, wherein the Light concurrs not at\r\nall, a man shall think he sees the same Colour. For proof of this, I might\r\nput you in mind, that 'tis usual for dreaming men to think they see the\r\nImages that appear to them in their sleep, adorn'd some with this, and some\r\nwith that lively Colour, whilst yet, both the curtains of their bed, and\r\nthose of their eyes are close drawn. And I might add the confidence with\r\nwhich distracted persons do oftentimes, when they are awake, think, they\r\nsee black fiends in places, where there is no black object in sight without\r\nthem. But I will rather observe, that not only when a man receives a great\r\nstroak upon his eye, or a very great one upon some other part of his head,\r\nhe is wont to see, as it were, flashes of lightning, and little vivid, but\r\nvanishing flames, though perhaps his eyes be shut: But the like apparitions\r\nmay happen, when the motion proceeds not from something without, but from\r\nsomething within the body, provided the unwonted fumes that wander up and\r\ndown in the head, or the propagated concussion of any internal part in the\r\nbody, do cause about the inward extremities of the Optick Nerve, such a\r\nmotion as is wont to be there produc'd, when the stroak of the Light upon\r\nthe _Retina_ makes us conclude, that we see either Light, or such and such\r\na Colour: This the most ingenious _Des Cartes_ hath very well observ'd, but\r\nbecause he seems not to have exemplifi'd it by any unobvious or peculiar\r\nobservation, I shall indeavour to illustrate this doctrine by a few\r\nInstances.\r\n\r\n5 And first, I remember, that having, through Gods goodness, been free for\r\nseveral years, from troublesome Coughs, being afterwards, by an accident,\r\nsuddenly cast into a violent one, I did often, when I was awaked in the\r\nnight by my distempers, observe, that upon coughing strongly, it would seem\r\nto mee, that I saw very vivid, but immediately disappearing flames, which I\r\ntook particular notice of, because of the conjecture I am now mentioning.\r\n\r\n6 An excellent and very discreet person, very near ally'd both to you and\r\nmee, was relating to mee, that some time since, whilst she was talking with\r\nsome other Ladies, upon a sudden, all the objects, she looked upon,\r\nappeared to her dyed with unusual Colours, some of one kind, and some of\r\nanother, but all so bright and vivid, that she should have been as much\r\ndelighted, as surpriz'd with them, but that finding the apparition to\r\ncontinue, she fear'd it portended some very great alteration as to her\r\nhealth: As indeed the day after she was assaulted with such violence by\r\nHysterical and Hypocondrical Distempers, as both made her rave for some\r\ndaies, and gave her, during that time, a Bastard Palsey.\r\n\r\n7 Being a while since in a Town, where the Plague had made great havock,\r\nand inquiring of an ingenious man, that was so bold, as without much\r\nscruple to visit those that were sick of it, about the odd symptomes of a\r\nDisease that had swept away so many there; he told mee, among other things,\r\nthat he was able to tell divers Patients, to whom he was called, before\r\nthey took their beds, or had any evident symptomes of the Plague, that they\r\nwere indeed infected upon peculiar observations, that being asked, they\r\nwould tell him that the neighbouring objects, and particularly his cloths,\r\nappear'd to them beautifi'd with most glorious Colours, like those of the\r\nRainbow, oftentimes succeeding one another; and this he affirm'd to be one\r\nof the most usual, as well as the most early symptomes, by which this odd\r\nPestilence disclos'd it self: And when I asked how long the Patients were\r\nwont to be thus affected, he answered, that it was most commonly for about\r\na day; and when I further inquired whether or no Vomits, which in that\r\nPestilence were usually given, did not remove this symptome (For some used\r\nthe taking of a Vomit, when they came ashore, to cure themselves of the\r\nobstinate and troublesome giddiness caus'd by the motion of the ship)\r\nreply'd, that generally, upon the evacuation made by the Vomit, that\r\nstrange apparition of Colours ceased, though the other symptomes were not\r\nso soon abated, yet he added (to take notice of that upon the by, because\r\nthe observation may perchance do good) that an excellent Physician, in\r\nwhose company he was wont to visit the sick, did give to almost all those\r\nto whom he was called, in the beginning before Nature was much weakened, a\r\npretty odd Vomit consisting of eight or ten dramms of Infusion of _Crocus\r\nMetallorum_, and about half a dramm, or much more, of White Vitriol, with\r\nsuch success, that scarce one of ten to whom it was seasonably administred,\r\nmiscarried.\r\n\r\n8 But to return to the consideration of Colours: As an apparition of them\r\nmay be produced by motions from within, without the assistance of an\r\noutward object, so I have observed, that 'tis sometimes possible that the\r\nColour that would otherwise be produced by an outward object, may be\r\nchang'd by some motion, or new texture already produced in the Sensory, as\r\nlong as that unusual motion, or new disposition lasts; for I have divers\r\ntimes try'd, that after I have through a Telescope look'd upon the Sun,\r\nthough thorow a thick, red, or blew glass, to make its splendor supportable\r\nto the eye, the impression upon the _Retina_, would be not only so vivid,\r\nbut so permanent, that if afterwards I turned my eye towards a flame, it\r\nwould appear to mee of a Colour very differing from its usual one. And if I\r\ndid divers times successively shut and open the same eye, I should see the\r\nadventitious Colour, (if I may so call it) changed or impair'd by degrees,\r\ntill at length (for this unusual motion of the eye would not presently\r\ncease) the flame would appear to mee, of the same hew that it did to other\r\nbeholders; a not unlike effect I found by looking upon the Moon, when she\r\nwas near full, thorow an excellent Telescope, without colour'd Glass to\r\nscreen my eye with; But that which I desire may be taken notice of, because\r\nwe may elsewhere have occasion to reflect upon it, and because it seems not\r\nagreeable to what Anatomists and Optical Writers deliver, touching the\r\nrelation of the two eyes to each other, is this circumstance, that though\r\nmy Right eye, with which I looked thorow the Telescope, were thus affected\r\nby the over-strong impression of the light, yet when the flame of a Candle,\r\nor some other bright object appear'd to me of a very unusual Colour, whilst\r\nlook'd upon with the Discompos'd Eye, or (though not so notably) with both\r\neyes at once; yet if I shut that Eye, and looked upon the same object with\r\nthe other, it would appear with no other than its usual Colour, though if I\r\nagain opened, and made use of the Dazled eye, the vivid adventitious Colour\r\nwould again appear. And on this occasion I must not pretermit an\r\nObservation which may perswade us, that an over-vehement stroak upon the\r\nSensory, especially if it be naturally of a weak constitution, may make a\r\nmore lasting impression than one would imagine, which impression may in\r\nsome cases, as it were, mingle with, and vitiate the action of vivid\r\nobjects for a long time after.\r\n\r\nFor I know a Lady of unquestionable Veracity, who having lately, by a\r\ndesperate fall, receiv'd several hurts, and particularly a considerable one\r\nupon a part of her face near her Eye, had her sight so troubl'd and\r\ndisorder'd, that, as she hath more than once related to me, not only when\r\nthe next morning one of her servants came to her bed side, to ask how she\r\ndid, his cloaths appear'd adorn'd with such variety of dazling Colours,\r\nthat she was fain presently to command him to withdraw, but the Images in\r\nher Hangings, did, for many daies after, appear to her, if the Room were\r\nnot extraordinarily darken'd, embellish'd with several offensively vivid\r\nColours, which no body else could see in them; And when I enquir'd whether\r\nor no White Objects did not appear to her adorn'd with more luminous\r\nColours than others, and whether she saw not some which she could not now\r\nwell describe to any, whose eyes had never been distemper'd, she answer'd\r\nmee, that sometimes she thought she saw Colours so new and glorious, that\r\nthey were of a peculiar kind, and such as she could not describe by their\r\nlikeness to any she had beheld either before or since, and that White\r\nObjects did so much disorder her sight, that if several daies after her\r\nfall, she look'd upon the inside of a Book, she fanci'd she saw there\r\nColours like those of the Rain-bow, and even when she thought her self\r\npretty well recover'd, and made bold to leave her Chamber, the coming into\r\na place where the Walls and Ceeling were whited over, made those Objects\r\nappear to her cloath'd with such glorious and dazling Colours, as much\r\noffended her sight, and made her repent her venturousness, and she added,\r\nthat this Distemper of her Eyes lasted no less than five or six weeks,\r\nthough, since that, she hath been able to read and write much without\r\nfinding the least Inconvenience in doing so. I would gladly have known,\r\nwhether if she had shut the Injur'd Eye, the _Phænomena_ would have been\r\nthe same, when she employ'd only the other, but I heard not of this\r\naccident early enough to satisfie that Enquiry.\r\n\r\n9 Wherefore, I shall now add, that some years before, a person exceedingly\r\neminent for his profound Skil in almost all kinds of Philological Learning,\r\ncoming to advise with mee about a Distemper in his Eyes, told me, among\r\nother Circumstances of it, that, having upon a time looked too fixedly upon\r\nthe Sun, thorow a Telescope, without any coloured Glass, to take off from\r\nthe dazling splendour of the Object, the excess of Light did so strongly\r\naffect his Eye, that ever since, when he turns it towards a Window, or any\r\nWhite Object, he fancies, he seeth a Globe of Light, of about the bigness\r\nthe Sun then appeared of to him, to pass before his Eyes: And having\r\nInquir'd of him, how long he had been troubled with this Indisposition, he\r\nreply'd, that it was already nine or ten years, since the Accident, that\r\noccasioned it, first befel him.\r\n\r\nI could here subjoyn, _Pyrophilus_, some memorable Relations that I have\r\nmet with in the Account given us by the experienc'd _Epiphanius\r\nFerdinandus_, of the Symptomes he observ'd to be incident to those that are\r\nbitten with the Tarantula, by which (Relations) I could probably shew, that\r\nwithout any change in the Object, a change in the Instruments of Vision may\r\nfor a great while make some Colours appear Charming, and make others\r\nProvoking, and both to a high degree, though neither of them produc'd any\r\nsuch Effects before. These things, I say, I could here subjoyn in\r\nconfirmation of what I have been saying, to shew, that the Disposition of\r\nthe Organ is of great Importance in the Dijudications we make of Colours,\r\nwere it not that these strange Stories belonging more properly to another\r\nDiscourse, I had rather, (contenting my self to have given you an\r\nIntimation of them here) that you should meet with them fully deliver'd\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nBut, _Pyrophilus_, I would not by all that I have hitherto discours'd, be\r\nthought to have forgotten the Distinction (of Colour) that I mentioned to\r\nyou about the beginning of the third Section of the former Chapter; and\r\ntherefore, after all I have said of Colour, as it is modifi'd Light, and\r\nimmediately affects the Sensory, I shall now re-mind you, that I did not\r\ndeny, but that Colour might in some sense be consider'd as a Quality\r\nresiding in the body that is said to be Colour'd, and indeed the greatest\r\npart of the following Experiments referr to Colour principally under that\r\nNotion, for there is in the bodyes we call Colour'd, and chiefly in their\r\nSuperficial parts, a certain disposition, whereby they do so trouble the\r\nLight that comes from them to our Eye, as that it there makes that distinct\r\nImpression, upon whose Account we say, that the Seen body is either White\r\nor Black, or Red or Yellow, or of any one determinate Colour. But because\r\nwe shall (God permiting) by the Experiments that are to follow some Pages\r\nhence, more fully and particularly shew, that the Changes, and consequently\r\nin divers places the Production and the appearance of Colours depends upon\r\nthe continuing or alter'd Texture of the Object, we shall in this place\r\nintimate (and that too but as by the way) two or three things about this\r\nMatter.\r\n\r\n2. And first it is not without some Reason, that I ascribe Colour (in the\r\nsense formerly explan'd) _chiefly_ to the Superficial parts of Bodies, for\r\nnot to question how much Opacous Corpuscles may abound even in those Bodies\r\nwe call Diaphanous, it seems plain that of Opacous bodies we do indeed see\r\nlittle else than the Superficies, for if we found the beams of Light that\r\nrebound from the Object to the Eye, to peirce deep into the Colour'd body,\r\nwe should not judge it Opacous, but either Translucid, or at least\r\nSemi-diaphanous, and though the Schools seem to teach us that Colour is a\r\nPenetrative Quality, that reaches to the Innermost parts of the Object, as\r\nif a piece of Sealing-wax be broken into never so many pieces, the Internal\r\nfragments will be as Red as the External surface did appear, yet that is\r\nbut a Particular Example that will not overthrow the Reason lately offer'd,\r\nespecially since I can alleage other Examples of a contrary Import, and two\r\nor three Negative Instances are sufficient to overthrow the Generality of a\r\nPositive Rule, especially if that be built but upon One or a Few Examples.\r\nNot (then) to mention Cherries, Plums, and I know not how many other\r\nBodies, wherein the skin is of one Colour, and what it hides of another, I\r\nshall name a couple of Instances drawn from the Colours of Durable bodies\r\nthat are thought far more Homogeneous, and have not parts that are either\r\nOrganical, or of a Nature approaching thereunto.\r\n\r\n3 To give you the first Instance, I shall need but to remind you of what I\r\ntold you a little after the beginning of this Essay, touching the Blew and\r\nRed and Yellow, that may be produc'd upon a piece of temper'd Steel, for\r\nthese Colours though they be very Vivid, yet if you break the Steel they\r\nadorn, they will appear to be but Superficial; not only the innermost parts\r\nof the Metall, but those that are within a hairs breadth of the\r\nSuperficies, having not any of these Colours, but retaining that of the\r\nSteel it self. Besides that, we may as well confirm this Observation, as\r\nsome other particulars we elsewhere deliver concerning Colours, by the\r\nfollowing Experiment which we purposely made.\r\n\r\n4 We took a good quantity of clean Lead, and melted it with a strong Fire,\r\nand then immediately pouring it out into a clean Vessel of a convenient\r\nshape and matter, (we us'd one of Iron, that the great and sudden Heat\r\nmight not injure it) and then carefully and nimbly taking off the Scum that\r\nfloated on the top, we perceiv'd, as we expected, the smooth and glossie\r\nSurface of the melted matter, to be adorn'd with a very glorious Colour,\r\nwhich being as Transitory as Delightfull, did almost immediately give place\r\nto another vivid Colour, and that was as quickly succeeded by a third, and\r\nthis as it were chas'd away by a fourth, and so these wonderfully vivid\r\nColours successively appear'd and vanish'd, (yet the same now and then\r\nappearing the second time) till the Metall ceasing to be hot enough to\r\nafford any longer this pleasing Spectacle, the Colours that chanc'd to\r\nadorn the Surface, when the Lead thus began to cool, remain'd upon it; but\r\nwere so Superficial, that how little soever we scrap'd off the Surface of\r\nthe Lead, we did in such places scrape off all the Colour, and discover\r\nonly that which is natural to the Metall it self, which receiving its\r\nadventitious Colours, only when the heat was very Intense, and in that part\r\nwhich was expos'd to the comparatively very cold Air, (which by other\r\nExperiments seems to abound with subtil Saline parts, perhaps not uncapable\r\nof working upon Lead so dispos'd:) These things I say, together with my\r\nobserving that whatever parts of the so strongly melted Lead were expos'd a\r\nwhile to the Air, turn'd into a kind of Scum or Litharge, how bright and\r\nclean soever they appear'd before, suggested to me some Thoughts or\r\nRavings, which I have not now time to acquaint You with. One that did not\r\nknow me, _Pyrophilus_, would perchance think I endeavour'd to impose upon\r\nYou by relating this Experiment, which I have several times try'd, but the\r\nReason why the _Phænomena_ mention'd have not been taken notice of, may be,\r\nthat unless Lead be brought to a much higher degree of Fusion or Fluidity\r\nthan is usual, or than is indeed requisite to make it melt, the _Phænomena_\r\nI mention'd will scarce at all disclose themselves; And we have also\r\nobserv'd that this successive appearing and vanishing of vivid Colours, was\r\nwont to be impair'd or determin'd whilst the Metal expos'd to the Air\r\nremain'd yet hotter than one would readily suspect. And one thing I must\r\nfurther Note, of which I leave You to search after the Reason, namely, that\r\nthe same Colours did not always and regularly succeed one another, as is\r\nusually in Steel, but in the diversify'd Order mention'd in this following\r\nNote, which I was scarce able to write down, the succession of the Colours\r\nwas so very quick, whether that proceeded from the differing degrees of\r\nHeat in the Lead expos'd to the cool Air, or from some other Reason, I\r\nleave you to examine.\r\n\r\n    [_Blew, Yellow, Purple, Blew; Green, Purple, Blew, Yellow, Red; Purple,\r\n    Blew, Yellow and Blew, Yellow, Blew, Purple, Green mixt, Yellow, Red,\r\n    Blew, Green, Yellow, Red, Purple, Green_.]\r\n\r\n5. The _Atomists_ of Old, and some Learned men of late, have attempted to\r\nexplicate the variety of Colours in Opacous bodies from the various Figures\r\nof their Superficial parts; the attempt is Ingenious, and the Doctrine\r\nseems partly True, but I confess I think there are divers other things that\r\nmust be taken in as concurrent to produce those differing forms of\r\nAsperity, whereon the Colours of Opacous bodies seem to depend. To declare\r\nthis a little, we must assume, that the Surfaces of all such Bodies how\r\nSmooth or polite soever they may appear to our Dull Sight and Touch, are\r\nexactly smooth only in a popular, or at most in a Physical sense, but not\r\nin a strict and rigid sense.\r\n\r\n6. This, excellent _Microscopes_ shew us in many Bodies, that seem Smooth\r\nto our naked Eyes; and this not only as to the little Hillocks or\r\nProtuberancies that swell above that which may be conceiv'd to be the Plain\r\nor Level of the consider'd Surface, for it is obvious enough to those that\r\nare any thing conversant with such Glasses, but as to numerous Depressions\r\nbeneath that Level, of which sort of Cavities by the help of a\r\n_Microscope_, which the greatest Artificer that makes them, judges to be\r\nthe greatest Magnifying Glass in _Europe_, except one that equals it, we\r\nhave on the Surface of a thin piece of Cork that appear'd smooth to the\r\nEye, observ'd about sixty in a Row, within the length of less then an 31\r\nand 32 part of an Inch, (for the Glass takes in no longer a space at one\r\nview) and these Cavities (which made that little piece of Cork look almost\r\nlike an empty Honey-comb) were not only very distinct, and figur'd like one\r\nanother, but of a considerable bigness, and a scarce credible depth;\r\ninsomuch that their distinct shadows as well as sides were plainly\r\ndiscern'd and easiy to be reckon'd, and might have been well distinguish'd,\r\nthough they had been ten times lesser than they were; which I thought it\r\nnot amiss to mention to you _Pyrophilus_ upon the by, that you may thence\r\nmake some Estimate, what a strange Inequality, and what a multitude of\r\nlittle Shades, there may really be, in a scarce sensible part of the\r\nPhysical superficies, though the naked Eye sees no such matter. And as\r\nExcellent _Microscopes_ shew us this Ruggedness in many Bodies that pass\r\nfor Smooth, so there are divers Experiments, though we must not now stay to\r\nurge them, which seem to perswade us of the same thing as to the rest of\r\nsuch Bodies as we are now treating off; So, that there is no sensible part\r\nof an Opacous body, that may not be conceiv'd to be made up of a multitude\r\nof singly insensible Corpuscles, but in the giving these surfaces that\r\ndisposition, which makes them alter the Light that reflects thence to the\r\nEye after the manner requisite to make the Object appear Green, Blew, &c.\r\nthe Figures of these Particles have _a great_, but not _the only_ stroak.\r\n'Tis true indeed that the protuberant Particles may be of very great\r\nvariety of Figures, Sphærical, Elliptical, Conical, Cylindrical,\r\nPolyedrical, and some very irregular, and that according to the Nature of\r\nthese, and the situation of the Lucid body, the Light must be variously\r\naffected, after one manner from Surfaces (I now speak of Physical Surfaces)\r\nconsisting of Sphaerical, and in another from those that are made up of\r\nConical or Cylindrical Corpuscles; some being fitted to reflect more of the\r\nincident Beams of Light, others less, and some towards one part, others\r\ntowards another. But besides this difference of Shape, there may be divers\r\nother things that may eminently concurr to vary the forms of Asperity that\r\nColours so much depend on. For, willingly allowing the Figure of the\r\nParticles in the first place, I consider secondly, that the superficial\r\nCorpuscles, if I may so call them, may be bigger in one Body, and less in\r\nanother, and consequently fitted to allay the Light falling on them with\r\ngreater shades. Next, the protuberant Particles may be set more or less\r\nclose together, that is, there may be a greater or a smaller number of them\r\nwithin the compass of one, than within the compass of another small part of\r\nthe Surface of the same Extent, and how much these Qualities may serve to\r\nproduce Colour may be somewhat guess'd at, by that which happens in the\r\nAgitation of Water; for if the Bubbles that are thereby made be Great, and\r\nbut Few, the Water will scarce acquire a sensible Colour, but if it be\r\nreduc'd to a Froth, consisting of Bubbles, which being very Minute and\r\nContiguous to each other, are a multitude of them crowded into a narrow\r\nRoom, the Water (turned to Froth) does then exhibit a very manifest White\r\nColour,[3] (to which these last nam'd Conditions of the Bubbles do as well\r\nas their Convex figure contribute) and that for Reasons to be mention'd\r\nanon. Besides, it is not necessary that the Superficial particles that\r\nexhibit one Colour, should be all of them Round, or all Conical, or all of\r\nany one Shape, but Corpuscles of differing Figures may be mingled on the\r\nSurface of the Opacous Body, as when the Corpuscles that make a Blew\r\ncolour, and those that make a Yellow, come to be Accurately and Skilfully\r\nmix'd, they make up a Green, which though it seem one simple Colour, yet in\r\nthis case appears to be made by Corpuscles of very differing Kinds, duely\r\ncommix'd. Moreover the Figure and Bigness of the little Depressions,\r\nCavities, Furrows or Pores intercepted betwixt these protuberant\r\nCorpuscles, are as well to be consider'd as the Sizes and Shapes of the\r\nCorpuscles themselves: For we may conceive the Physical superficies of a\r\nBody, where (as we said) its Colour does as it were reside, to be cut\r\nTransversly by a Mathematical plain, which you know is conceiv'd to be\r\nwithout any Depth or Thickness at all, and then as some parts of the\r\nPhysical Superficies will be Protuberant; or swell above this last plain,\r\nso others may be depress'd beneath it; as (to explane my self by a gross\r\nComparison) in divers places of the Surface of the Earth, there are not\r\nonly Neighbouring Hills, Trees, &c. that are rais'd above the Horizontal\r\nLevel of the Valley, but Rivers, Wells, Pits and other Cavities that are\r\ndepress'd beneath it, and that such Protuberant and Concave parts of a\r\nSurface may remit the Light so differingly, as much to vary a Colour, some\r\nexamples and other things, that we shall hereafter have occasion to take\r\nnotice off in this Tract, will sufficiently declare, till when, it may\r\nsuffice to put you in mind, that of two Flat-sides of the same piece of,\r\nfor example, red Marble, the one being diligently Polished, and the other\r\nleft to its former Roughness, the differing degrees or sorts of Asperity,\r\nfor the side that is smooth to the Touch wants not its Roughness, will so\r\ndiversifie the Light reflected from the several Plains to the Eye, that a\r\nPainter would employ two differing Colours to represent them.\r\n\r\n  [3] _See the Discourse of the Nature of Whiteness and Blackness._\r\n\r\n7. And I hope, _Pyrophilus_, you will not think it strange or impertinent,\r\nthat I employ in divers passages of these Papers, examples drawn from\r\nBodies and Shadows far more Gross, than those minute Protuberances and\r\nshady Pores on which in most cases the Colour of a Body as 'tis an Inherent\r\nQuality or Disposition of its Surface, seems to depend. For sometimes I\r\nemploy such Examples, rather to declare my Meaning, than prove my\r\nConjecture; things, whom their Smallness makes Insensible, being better\r\nrepresented to the Imagination by such familiar Objects, as being like them\r\nenough in other respects, are of a Visible bulk. And next, though the Beams\r\nof Light are such subtil Bodies, that in respect of them, even Surfaces\r\nthat are sensibly Smooth, are not exactly so, but have their own degree of\r\nRoughness, consisting of little Protuberances and Depressions; and though\r\nconsequently such Inequalities may suffice to give Bodies differing\r\nColours, as we see in Marble that appears White or Black, or Red or Blew,\r\neven when the most carefully Polish'd, yet 'tis plain by the late Instance\r\nof Red Marble, and many others, that even bigger Protuberances and greater\r\nShades may likewise so Diversifie the Roughness of a Bodies Superficies, as\r\nmanifestly to concurr to the varying of its Colour, whereby such Examples\r\nappear to be proper enough to be employ'd in such a Subject as we have now\r\nin hand. And having hinted thus much on this Occasion, I now proceed.\r\n\r\n8. The Situation also of the Superficial particles is considerable, which I\r\ndistinguish into the Posture of the single Corpuscles, in respect of the\r\nLight, and of the Eye, and the Order of them in reference also to one\r\nanother; for a Body may otherwise reflect the Light, when its Superficial\r\nparticles are more erected upon the Plain that may be conceiv'd to pass\r\nalong their Basis, and when the Points or Extremes of such Particles are\r\nObverted to the Eye, than when those Particles are so Inclin'd, that their\r\nSides are in great part Discernable, as the Colour of Plush or Velvet will\r\nappear Vary'd to you, if you carefully stroak part of it one way, and part\r\nof it another, the posture of the particular Thrids, in reference to the\r\nLight, or the Eye, becoming thereby different. And you may observe in a\r\nField of ripe Corn blown upon by the Wind, that there will appear as it\r\nwere Waves of a Colour (at least Gradually) differing from that of the rest\r\nof the Field, the Wind by Depressing some of the Ears, and not at the same\r\ntime others, making the one Reflect more from the Lateral and Strawy parts,\r\nthan do the rest. And so, when Doggs are so angry, as to Erect the Hairs\r\nupon their Necks, and upon some other parts of their Bodies, those Parts\r\nseem to acquire a Colour vary'd from that which the same Hairs made, when\r\nin their usual Posture they did farr more stoop. And that the Order wherein\r\nthe Superficial Corpuscles are Rang'd is not to be neglected, we may guess\r\nby turning of Water into Froth, the beating of Glass, and the scraping of\r\nHorns, in which cases the Corpuscles that were before so marshall'd as to\r\nbe Perspicuous, do by the troubling of that Order become Dispos'd to\r\nterminate and reflect more Light, and thereby to appear Whitish. And there\r\nare other ways in which the Order of the Protuberant parts, in reference to\r\nthe Eye, may much contribute to the appearing of a particular Colour, for I\r\nhave often observ'd, that when Pease are Planted, or Set in Parallel Lines,\r\nand are Shot up about half a Foot above the Surface of the Ground, by\r\nlooking on the Field or Plot of Ground from that part towards which the\r\nParallel Lines tended, the greater part of the Ground by farr would appear\r\nof its own dirty Colour, but if I look'd upon it Transversly, the Plot\r\nwould appear very Green, the upper parts of the Pease hindering the\r\nintercepted parts of the Ground, which as I said retain'd their wonted\r\nColour, from being discover'd by the Eye. And I know not, _Pyrophilus_,\r\nwhether I might not add, that even the Motion of the Small Parts of a\r\nVisible Object may in some cases contribute, though it be not so easie to\r\nsay how, to the Producing or the Varying of a Colour; for I have several\r\ntimes made a Liquor, which when it has well settled in a close Vial, is\r\nTransparent and Colourless, but as soon as the Glass is unstopp'd, begins\r\nto fly away very plentifully in a White and Opacous fume; and there are\r\nother Bodies, whose Fumes, when they fill a Receiver, would make one\r\nsuspect it contains Milk, and yet when these Fumes settle into a Liquor,\r\nthat Liquor is not White, but Transparent; And such White Fumes I have seen\r\nafforded by unstopping a Liquor I know, which yet is it self Diaphanous and\r\nRed; Nor are these the only Instances of this Kind, that our Tryals can\r\nsupply us with. And if the Superficial Corpuscles be of the Grosser sort,\r\nand be so Framed, that their differing Sides or Faces may exhibit differing\r\nColours, then the Motion or Rest of those Corpuscles may be considerable,\r\nas to the Colour of the Superficies they compose, upon this account, that\r\nsometimes more, sometimes fewer of the Sides dispos'd to exhibit such a\r\nColour may by this means become or continue more Obverted to the Eye than\r\nthe rest, and compose a Physical Surface, that will be more or less\r\nsensibly interrupted; As, to explane my meaning, by proposing a gross\r\nExample, I remember, that in some sorts of Leavy Plants thick set by one\r\nanother, the two sides of whose Leaves were of somewhat differing Colours,\r\nthere would be a notable Disparity as to Colour, if you look'd upon them\r\nboth when the Leaves being at Rest had their upper and commonly expos'd\r\nsides Obverted to the Eye, and when a breath of Wind passing thorow them,\r\nmade great Numbers of the usually Hidden sides of the Leaves become\r\nconspicuous. And though the Little Bodies, we were lately speaking of, may\r\nSingly and Apart seem almost Colourless, yet when Many of them are plac'd\r\nby one another, so near, that the Eye does not easily discern an\r\nInterruption, within a sensible space, they may exhibit a Colour; as we\r\nsee, that though a Slenderest Thrid of Dy'd Silk do's, whilst look'd on\r\nSingle, seem almost quite Devoyd of Redness, (for instance) yet when\r\nnumbers of these Thrids are brought together into one Skein, their Colour\r\nbecomes notorious.\r\n\r\n9. But the same Occasion that invited me to say what I have mention'd\r\nconcerning the Leaves of Trees, invites me also to give you some account of\r\nwhat happens in Changeable Taffities, where we see differing Colours, as it\r\nwere, Emerge and Vanish upon the Ruffling of the same piece of Silk: As I\r\nhave divers times with Pleasure observ'd, by the help of such a\r\n_Microscope_, as, though it do not very much Magnifie the Object, has in\r\nrecompence this great Conveniency, that you may easily, as fast as you\r\nplease, remove it from one part to another of a Large Object, of which the\r\nGlass taking a great part at once, you may thereby presently Survey the\r\nWhole. Now by the help of such a _Microscope_ I could easily (as I began to\r\nsay) discern, that in a piece of Changeable Taffity, (that appear'd, for\r\nInstance, sometimes Red, and sometimes Green) the Stuff was compos'd of Red\r\nthrids and Green, passing under and over each other, and crossing one\r\nanother in almost innumerable points; and if I look'd through the Glass\r\nupon any considerable portion of the Stuff, that (for example sake) to the\r\nnaked Eye appear'd to be Red, I could plainly see, that in that Position,\r\nthe Red thrids were Conspicuous, and reflected a vivid Light; and though I\r\ncould also perceive, that there were Green ones, yet by reason of their\r\ndisadvantagious Position in the _Physical Surface_ of the Taffity, they\r\nwere in part hid by the more Protuberant Thrids of the other Colour; and\r\nfor the same cause, the Reflection from as much of the Green as was\r\ndiscover'd, was comparatively but Dim and Faint. And if, on the contrary, I\r\nlook'd through the _Microscope_ upon any part that appear'd Green, I could\r\nplainly see that the Red thrids were less fully expos'd to the Eye, and\r\nobscur'd by the Green ones, which therefore made up the Predominant Colour.\r\nAnd by observing the Texture of the Silken Stuff, I could easisy so expose\r\nthe Thrids either of the one Colour or of the other to my Eye, as at\r\npleasure to exhibit an apparition of Red or Green, or make those Colours\r\nsucceed one another: So that, when I observ'd their Succession by the help\r\nof the Glass, I could mark how the Predominant Colour did as it were start\r\nout, when the Thrids that exhibited it came to be advanagiously plac'd; And\r\nby making little Folds in the Stuff after a certain manner, the Sides that\r\nmet and terminated in those Folds, would appear to the naked Eye, one of\r\nthem Red, and the other Green. When Thrids of more than two differing\r\nColours chance to be Interwoven, the resulting changeableness of the\r\nTaffity may be also somewhat different. But I choose to give an Instance in\r\nthe Stuff I have been speaking off, because the mixture being more Simple,\r\nthe way whereby the Changeableness is produc'd, may be the more easily\r\napprehended: and though Reason alone might readily enough lead a\r\nconsidering Man to guess at the Explication, in case he knew how Changeable\r\nTaffities are made: yet I thought it not impertinent to mention it, because\r\nboth Scholars and Gentlemen are wont to look upon the Inquiry into\r\nManufactures, as a _Mechanick_ imployment, and consequently below Them; and\r\nbecause also with such a _Microscope_ as I have been mentioning, the\r\ndiscovery is as well Pleasant as Satisfactory, and may afford Hints of the\r\nSolution of other _Phænomena_ of Colours. And it were not amiss, that some\r\ndiligent Inquiry were made, whether the _Microscope_ would give us an\r\naccount of the Variableness of Colour, that is so Conspicuous and so\r\nDelightfull in Mother of Pearl, in Opalls, and some other resembling\r\nBodies: For though I remember I did formerly attempt something of that Kind\r\n(fruitlesly enough) upon Mother of Pearl, yet not having then the advantage\r\nof my best _Microscope_, nor some Conveniences that might have been wish'd,\r\nI leave it to you, who have better Eyes, to try what you can do further;\r\nsince 'twill be _Some_ discovery to find, that, in this case, the best Eyes\r\nand _Microscopes_ themselves can make _None_.\r\n\r\n10. I confess, _Pyrophilus_, that a great part of what I have deliver'd,\r\n(or propos'd rather) concerning the differing forms of Asperity in Bodies,\r\nby which Differences the incident Light either comes to be Reflected with\r\nmore or less of Shade, and with that Shade more or less Interrupted, or\r\nelse happens to be also otherwise Modify'd or Troubl'd, is but Conjectural.\r\nBut I am not sure, that if it were not for the Dullness of our Senses,\r\neither these or some other Notions of Kin to them, might be better\r\nCountenanc'd; for I am apt to suspect, that if we were Sharp sighted\r\nenough, or had such perfect _Microscopes_, as I fear are more to be wish'd\r\nthan hop'd for, our promoted Sense might discern in the Physical Surfaces\r\nof Bodies, both a great many latent Ruggidnesses, and the particular Sizes,\r\nShapes, and Situations of the extremely little Bodies that cause them, and\r\nperhaps might perceive among other Varieties that we now can but imagine,\r\nhow those little Protuberances and Cavities do Interrupt and Dilate the\r\nLight, by mingling with it a multitude of little and singly undiscernable\r\nShades, though some of them more, and some of them less Minute, some less,\r\nand some more Numerous; according to the Nature and Degree of the\r\nparticular Colour we attribute to the Visible Object; as we see, that in\r\nthe Moon we can with Excellent _Telescopes_ discern many Hills and Vallies,\r\nand as it were Pits and other Parts, whereof some are more, and some less\r\nVividly illustrated, and others have a fainter, others a deeper Shade,\r\nthough the naked Eye can discern no such matter in that Planet. And with an\r\nExcellent _Microscope_, where the _Naked_ Eye did see but a Green powder,\r\nthe _Assisted_ Eye as we noted above, could discern particular Granules,\r\nsome of them of a Blew, and some of them of a Yellow colour, which\r\nCorpuscles we had beforehand caus'd to be exquisitly mix'd to compound the\r\nGreen.\r\n\r\n11. And, _Pyrophilus_, that you may not think me altogether extravagant in\r\nwhat I have said of the Possibility, (for I speak of no more) of discerning\r\nthe differing forms of Asperity in the Surfaces of Bodies of several\r\nColours, I'l here set down a Memorable particular that chanc'd to come to\r\nmy Knowledge, since I writ a good part of this _Essay_; and it is this.\r\nMeeting casually the other Day with the deservedly Famous[4] Dr. _J.\r\nFinch_, Extraordinary _Anatomist_ to that Great Patron of the _Virtuosi_,\r\nthe now Great Duke of _Toscany_, and enquiring of this Ingenious Person,\r\nwhat might be the chief Rarity he had seen in his late return out of\r\n_Italy_ into _England_, he told me, it was a Man at _Maestricht_ in the\r\nLow-Countrys, who at certain times can discern and _distinguish Colours by\r\nthe Touch_ with his Fingers. You'l easily Conclude, that this is farr more\r\nstrange, than what I propos'd but as _not Impossible_; since the Sense of\r\nthe _Retina_ seeming to be much more Tender and quick than that of those\r\nGrosser Filaments, Nerves or Membranes of our Fingers, wherewith we use to\r\nhandle Gross and Hard Bodies, it seems scarce credible, that any\r\nAccustomance, or Diet, or peculiarity of Constitution, should enable a Man\r\nto distinguish with such Gross and Unsuitable Organs, such Nice and Subtile\r\nDifferences as those of the forms of Asperity, that belong to differing\r\nColours, to receive whose Languid and Delicate Impressions by the\r\nIntervention of Light, Nature seems to have appointed and contexed into the\r\n_Retina_ the tender and delicate Pith of the Optick Nerve. Wherefore I\r\nconfess, I propos'd divers Scruples, and particularly whether the Doctor\r\nhad taken care to bind a Napkin or Hankerchief over his Eyes so carefully,\r\nas to be sure he could make no use of his Sight, though he had but\r\nCounterfeited the want of it, to which I added divers other Questions, to\r\nsatisfie my Self, whether there were any Likelihood of Collusion or other\r\nTricks. But I found that the Judicious Doctor having gone farr out of his\r\nway, purposely to satisfie Himself and his Learned Prince about this\r\nWonder, had been very Watchfull and Circumspect to keep _Himself_ from\r\nbeing Impos'd upon. And that he might not through any mistake in point of\r\nMemory mis-inform _Me_, he did me the Favour at my Request, to look out the\r\nNotes he had Written for his Own and his Princes Information, the summ of\r\nwhich Memorials, as far as we shall mention them here, was this, That the\r\nDoctor having been inform'd at _Utrecht_, that there Lived one at some\r\nMiles distance from _Maestricht_, who could distinguish Colours by the\r\nTouch, when he came to the last nam'd Town, he sent a Messenger for him,\r\nand having Examin'd him, was told upon Enquiry these Particulars:\r\n\r\n  [4] Since for his eminent Qualities and Loyalty Grac'd, by his Majesty,\r\n  with the Honour of Knighthood.\r\n\r\nThat the Man's name was _John Vermaasen_, at that time about 33 Years of\r\nAge; that when he was but two years Old, he had the Small Pox, which\r\nrendred him absolutely Blind: That at this present he is an _Organist_, and\r\nserves that Office in a publick Quire.\r\n\r\nThat the Doctor discoursing with him over Night, the Blind man affirm'd,\r\nthat he could distinguish Colours by the Touch, but that he could not do\r\nit, unless he were Fasting; Any quantity of Drink taking from him that\r\nExquisitness of Touch, which is requisite to so Nice a Sensation.\r\n\r\nThat hereupon the Doctor provided against the next Morning seven pieces of\r\nRibbon, of these seven Colours, Black, White, Red, Blew, Green, Yellow, and\r\nGray, but as for _mingled_ Colours, this _Vermaasen_ would not undertake to\r\ndiscern them, though if offer'd, he would tell that they were _Mix'd_.\r\n\r\nThat to discern the Colour of the Ribbon, he places it betwixt the Thumb\r\nand the Fore-finger, but his most exquisite perception was in his Thumb,\r\nand much better in the right Thumb than in the left.\r\n\r\nThat after the Blind man had four or five times told the Doctor the several\r\nColours, (though Blinded with a Napkin for fear he might have some Sight)\r\nthe Doctor found he was twice mistaken, for he call'd the White Black, and\r\nthe Red Blew, but still, he, before his Errour, would lay them by in Pairs,\r\nsaying, that though he could easily distinguish them from all others, yet\r\nthose two Pairs were not easily distinguish'd amongst themselves, whereupon\r\nthe Doctor desir'd to be told by him what kind of Discrimination he had of\r\nColours by his Touch, to which he gave a reply, for whose sake chiefly I\r\ninsert all this Narrative in this place, namely, That all the difference\r\nwas more or less Asperity, for says he, (I give you the Doctor's own words)\r\nBlack feels as if you were feeling Needles points, or some harsh Sand, and\r\nRed feels very Smooth.\r\n\r\nThat the Doctor having desir'd him to tell in Order the difference of\r\nColours to his Touch, he did as follows;\r\n\r\nBlack and White are the most asperous or unequal of all Colours, and so\r\nlike, that 'tis very hard to distinguish them, but Black is the most Rough\r\nof the two, Green is next in Asperity, Gray next to Green in Asperity,\r\nYellow is the fifth in degree of Asperity, Red and Blew are so like, that\r\nthey are as hard to distinguish as Black and White, but Red is somewhat\r\nmore Asperous than Blew, so that Red has the sixth place, and Blew the\r\nseventh in Asperity.\r\n\r\n12. To these Informations the Obliging Doctor was pleas'd to add the\r\nwelcome present of three of those very pieces of Ribbon, whose Colours in\r\nhis presence the Blind man had distinguished, pronouncing the one Gray, the\r\nother Red, and the third Green, which I keep by me as Rarities, and the\r\nrather, because he fear'd the rest were miscarry'd.\r\n\r\n13. Before I saw the Notes that afforded me the precedent Narrative, I\r\nconfess I suspected this man might have thus discriminated Colours, rather\r\nby the Smell than by the Touch; for some of the Ingredients imployed by\r\nDyers to Colour things, have Sents, that are not so Languid, nor so near of\r\nKin, but that I thought it not impossible that a very Critical Nose might\r\ndistinguish them, and this I the rather suspected, because he requir'd,\r\nthat the Ribbons, whose Colours he was to Name, should be offer'd him\r\nFasting in the morning; for I have observ'd in Setting Doggs, that the\r\nfeeding of them (especially with some sorts of Aliments) does very much\r\nimpair the exquisite sent of their Noses. And though some of the foregoing\r\nparticulars would have prevented that Conjecture, yet I confess to you\r\n(_Pyrophilus_) that I would gladly have had the Opportunity of Examining\r\nthis Man my self, and of Questioning him about divers particulars which I\r\ndo not find to have been yet thought upon. And though it be not incredible\r\nto me, that since the Liquors that Dyers imploy to tinge, are qualifi'd to\r\ndo so by multitudes of little Corpuscles of the Pigment or Dying stuff,\r\nwhich are dissolved and extracted by the Liquor, and swim to and fro in it,\r\nthose Corpuscles of Colour (as the _Atomists_ call them) insinuating\r\nthemselves into, and filling all the Pores of the Body to be Dyed, may\r\nAsperate its Superficies more or less according to the Bigness and Texture\r\nof the Corpuscles of the Pigment; yet I can scarce believe, that our Blind\r\nman could distinguish all the Colours he did, meerly by the Ribbons having\r\nmore or less of Asperity, so that I cannot but think, notwithstanding this\r\nHistory, that the Blind man distinguish'd Colours not only by the _Degrees_\r\nof Asperity in the Bodies offer'd to him, but by _Forms_ of it, though this\r\n(latter) would perhaps have been very difficult for him to make an\r\nIntelligible mention of, because those Minute disparities having not been\r\ntaken notice of by men for want of touch as Exquisite as our Blind Mans,\r\nare things he could not have Intelligibly express'd, which will easily seem\r\nProbable, if you consider, that under the name of Sharp, and Sweet, and\r\nSour, there are abundance of, as it were, immediate peculiar Relishes or\r\nTasts in differing sorts of Wine, which though Critical and Experienc'd\r\nPalats can easily discern themselves cannot make them be understood by\r\nothers, such Minute differences not having hitherto any Distinct names\r\nassign'd them. And it seems that there was somthing in the Forms of\r\nAsperity that was requisite to the Distinction of Colours, besides the\r\nDegree of it, since he found it so difficult to distingush Black and White\r\nfrom one another, though not from other Colours. For I might urge, that he\r\nseems not consonant to himself about the _Red_, which as you have seen in\r\none place, he represents as somewhat more Asperous than the _Blew_; and in\r\nanother, very Smooth: But because he speaks of this Smoothness in that\r\nplace, where he mentions the Roughness of _Black_, we may favourably\r\npresume that he might mean but a _comparative Smoothness_; and therefore I\r\nshall not Insist on this, but rather Countenance my Conjecture by this,\r\nthat he found it so Difficult, not only, to Discriminate Red and Blew,\r\n(though the first of our promiscuous Experiments will inform you, that the\r\nRed reflects by great Odds more Light than the other) but also to\r\ndistinguish Black and White from one another, though not from other\r\nColours. And indeed, though in the Ribbonds that were offer'd him, they\r\nmight be almost equally Rough, yet in such slender Corpuscles as those of\r\nColour, there may easily enough be Conceiv'd, not only a greater Closeness\r\nof Parts, or else Paucity of Protuberant Corpuscles, and the little extant\r\nParticles may be otherwise Figur'd, and Rang'd in the White than in the\r\nBlack, but the Cavities may be much Deeper in the one than the other.\r\n\r\n14. And perhaps, (_Pyrophilus_) it may prove some _Illustration of what I\r\nmean_, and help you to conceive how _this may_ be, if I Represent, that\r\nwhere the Particles are so exceeding Slender, we may allow the Parts\r\nexpos'd to the Sight and Touch to be a little Convex in comparison of the\r\nErected Particle of Black Bodies, as if there were Wyres I know not how\r\nmany times Slenderer than a Hair: whether you suppose them to be Figur'd\r\nlike Needles, or Cylindrically, like the Hairs of a Brush, with\r\nHemisphærical (or at least Convex) Tops, they will be so very Slender, and\r\nconsequently the Points both of the one sort and the other so very Sharp,\r\nthat even an exquisite Touch will be able to distinguish no greater\r\nDifference between them, than that which our Blind man allow'd, when\r\ncomparing Black and White Bodies, he said, that the latter was the less\r\nRough of the two. Nor is every Kind of Roughness, though Sensible enough,\r\nInconsistent with Whiteness, there being Cases, wherein the Physical\r\nSuperficies of a Body is made by the same Operation both _Rough_ and\r\n_white_, as when the Level Surface of clear Water being by agitation\r\nAsperated with a multitude of Unequal Bubbles, do's thereby acquire a\r\nWhiteness; and as a Smooth piece of Glass, by being Scratch'd with a\r\nDiamond, do's in the Asperated part of its Surface disclose the same\r\nColour. But more (perchance) of this elsewhere.\r\n\r\n15. And therefore, we shall here pass by the Question, whether any thing\r\nmight be consider'd about the Opacity of the Corpuscles of Black Pigments,\r\nand the _Comparative_ Diaphaneity of those of many White Bodies, apply'd to\r\nour present Case; and proceed, to represent, That the newly mention'd\r\nExiguity and Shape of the extant Particles being suppos'd, it will then be\r\nconsiderable what we lately but Hinted, (and therefore must now somewhat\r\nExplane) That the Depth of the little Cavities, intercepted between the\r\nextant Particles, without being so much greater in Black Bodies than in\r\nWhite ones, as to be perceptibly so to the Gross Organs of Touch, may be\r\nvery much greater in reference to their Disposition of Reflecting the\r\nimaginary subtile Beams of Light. For in Black Bodies, those Little\r\nintercepted Cavities, and other Depressions, may be so Figur'd, so Narrow\r\nand so Deep, that the incident Beams of Light, which the more extant Parts\r\nof the Physical Superficies are dispos'd to Reflect inwards, may be\r\nDetain'd there, and prove unable to Emerge; whilst in a White Body, the\r\nSlender Particles may not only by their Figure be fitted to Reflect the\r\nLight copiously outwards, but the intercepted Cavities being not Deep, nor\r\nperhaps very Narrow, the Bottoms of them may be so Constituted, as to be\r\nfit to Reflect outwards much of the Light that falls even upon Them; as you\r\nmay possibly better apprehend, when we shall come to treat of Whiteness and\r\nBlackness. In the mean time it may suffice, that you take Notice with me,\r\nthat the Blind mans Relations import no necessity of Concluding, that,\r\nthough, because, according to the Judgment of his Touch, Black was the\r\nRoughest, as it is the Darkest of Colours, therefore White, which\r\n(according to us) is the Lightest, should be also the Smoothest: since I\r\nobserve, that he makes Yellow to be two Degrees more Asperous than Blew,\r\nand as much less Asperous than Green; whereas indeed, Yellow do's not only\r\nappear to the Eye a Lighter Colour than Blew, but (by our first Experiment\r\nhereafter to be mention'd) it will appear, that Yellow reflected much more\r\nLight than Blew, and manifestly more than Green, (which we need not much\r\nwonder at, since in this Colour and the two others (Blew and Yellow) 'tis\r\nnot _only_ the _Reflected Light_ that is to be considered, since to produce\r\nboth these, _Refraction_ seems to Intervene, which by its Varieties may\r\nmuch alter the Case:) which both seems to strengthen the Conjecture I was\r\nformerly proposing, that there was something else in the _Kinds_ of\r\nAsperity, as well as in the _Degrees_ of it, which enabled our Blind man to\r\nDiscriminate Colours, and do's at least show, that we cannot in all Cases\r\nfrom the bare Difference in the Degrees of Asperity betwixt Colours, safely\r\nconclude, that the Rougher of any two always Reflects the least Light.\r\n\r\n16. But this notwithstanding, (_Pyrophilus_) and what ever Curiosity I may\r\nhave had to move some Questions to our Sagacious Blind man, yet thus much I\r\nthink you will admit us to have gain'd by his Testimony, that since many\r\nColours may be felt with the Circumstances above related, the Surfaces of\r\nsuch Coloured Bodies must certainly have differing _Degrees_, and in all\r\nprobability have differing _Forms_ or Kinds of Asperity belonging to them,\r\nwhich is all the Use that my present attempt obliges me to make of the\r\nHistory above deliver'd, that being sufficient to prove, _that_ Colour do's\r\nmuch depend upon the Disposition of the Superficial parts of Bodies, and to\r\nshew in general, _wherein_ 'tis probable that such a Disposition do's\r\n(principally at least) consist.\r\n\r\n17. But to return to what I was saying before I began to make mention of\r\nour Blind _Organist_, what we have deliver'd touching the causes of the\r\nseveral Forms or Asperity that may Diversifie the Surfaces of Colour'd\r\nBodies, may perchance somewhat assist us to make some Conjectures in the\r\ngeneral, at several of the ways whereby 'tis possible for the Experiments\r\nhereafter to be mention'd, to produce the suddain changes of Colours that\r\nare wont to be Consequent upon them; for most of these _Phænomena_ being\r\nproduc'd by the Intervention of Liquors, and these for the most part\r\nabounding with very Minute, Active, and Variously Figur'd Saline\r\nCorpuscles, Liquors so Qualify'd may well enough very Nimbly after the\r\nTexture of the Body they are imploy'd to Work upon, and so may change the\r\nform of Asperity, and thereby make them Remit to the Eye the Light that\r\nfalls on them, after another manner than they did before, and by that means\r\nVary the Colour, so farr forth as it depends upon the Texture or\r\nDisposition of the Seen Parts of the Object, which I say, _Pyrophilus_,\r\nthat you may not think I would absolutely exclude all other ways of\r\nModifying the Beams of Light between their Parting from the Lucid Body, and\r\ntheir Reception into the common Sensory.\r\n\r\n18. Now there seem to me divers ways, by which we may conceive that Liquors\r\nmay Nimbly alter the Colour of one another, and of other Bodies, upon which\r\nthey Act, but my present haste will allow me to mention but some of them,\r\nwithout Insisting so much as upon those I shall name.\r\n\r\n19. And first, the Minute Corpuscles that compose a Liquor may early\r\ninsinuate themselves into those Pores of Bodies, whereto their Size and\r\nFigure makes them Congruous, and these Pores they may either exactly Fill,\r\nor but Inadequately, and in this latter Case they will for the most part\r\nalter the Number and Figure, and always the Bigness of the former Pores.\r\nAnd in what capacity soever these Corpuscles of a Liquor come to be Lodg'd\r\nor Harbour'd in the Pores that admit them, the Surface of the Body will for\r\nthe most part have its Asperity alter'd, and the Incident Light that meets\r\nwith a Grosser Liquor in the little Cavities that before contain'd nothing\r\nbut Air, or some yet Subtiler Fluid, will have its Beams either Refracted,\r\nor Imbib'd, or else Reflected more or less Interruptedly, than they would\r\nbe, if the Body had been Unmoistned, as we see, that even fair Water\r\nfalling on white Paper, or Linnen, and divers other Bodies apt to soak it\r\nin, will for some such Reasons as those newly mention'd, immediately alter\r\nthe Colour of them, and for the most part make it Sadder than that of the\r\nUnwetted Parts of the same Bodies. And so you may see, that when in the\r\nSummer the High-ways are Dry and Dusty, if there falls store of Rain, they\r\nwill quickly appear of a much Darker Colour than they did before, and if a\r\nDrop of Oyl be let fall upon a Sheet of White Paper, that part of it, which\r\nby the Imbibition of the Liquor acquires a greater Continuity, and some\r\nTransparency, will appear much Darker than the rest, many of the Incident\r\nBeams of Light being now Transmitted, that otherwise would be Reflected\r\ntowards the Beholders Eyes.\r\n\r\n20. Secondly, A Liquor may alter the Colour of a Body by freeing it from\r\nthose things that hindred it from appearing in its Genuine Colour; and\r\nthough this may be said to be rather a Restauration of a Body to its own\r\nColour, or a Retection of its native Colour, than a Change, yet still there\r\nIntervenes in it a change of the Colour which the Body appear'd to be of\r\nbefore this Operation. And such a change a Liquor may work, either by\r\nDissolving, or Corroding, or by some such way of carrying off that Matter,\r\nwhich either Veil'd or Disguis'd the Colour that afterwards appears. Thus\r\nwe restore Old pieces of Dirty Gold to a clean and nitid Yellow, by putting\r\nthem into the Fire, and into _Aqua-fortis_, which take off the adventitious\r\nFilth that made that pure Metall look of a Dirty Colour. And there is also\r\nan easie way to restore Silver Coyns to their due Lustre, by fetching off\r\nthat which Discolour'd them. And I know a _Chymical_ Liquor, which I\r\nemploy'd to restore pieces of Cloath spotted with Grease to their proper\r\nColour, by Imbibing the Spotted part with this Liquor, which Incorporating\r\nwith the Grease, and yet being of a very Volatile Nature, does easily carry\r\nit away with it Self. And I have sometimes try'd, that by Rubbing upon a\r\ngood Touch-stone a certain _Metalline_ mixture so Compounded, that the\r\nImpression it left upon the Stone appear'd of a very differing Colour from\r\nthat of Gold, yet a little of _Aqua-fortis_ would in a Trice make the\r\nGolden Colour disclose it self, by Dissolving the other _Metalline_\r\nCorpuscles that conceal'd those of the Gold, which you know that\r\n_Menstruum_ will leave Untouch'd.\r\n\r\n21. Thirdly, A Liquor may alter the Colour of a Body by making a\r\nComminution of its Parts, and that principally two ways, the first by\r\nDisjoyning and Dissipating those Clusters of Particles, if I may so call\r\nthem, which stuck more Loosely together, being fastned only by some more\r\neasily Dissoluble Ciment, which seems to be the Case of some of the\r\nfollowing Experiments, where you'l find the Colour of many Corpuscles\r\nbrought to cohere by having been Precipitated together, Destroy'd by the\r\nAffusion of very peircing and incisive Liquors. The other of the two ways I\r\nwas speaking of, is, by Dividing the Grosser and more Solid Particles into\r\nMinute ones, which will be always Lesser, and for the most part otherwise\r\nShap'd than the Entire Corpuscle so Divided, as it will happen in a piece\r\nof Wood reduc'd into Splinters or Chips, or as when a piece of Chrystal\r\nheated red Hot and quench'd in Cold water is crack'd into a multitude of\r\nlittle Fragments, which though they fall not asunder, alter the Disposition\r\nof the Body of the Chrystal, as to its manner of Reflecting the Light, as\r\nwe shall have Occasion to shew hereafter.\r\n\r\n22. There is a fourth way contrary to the third, whereby a Liquor may\r\nchange the Colour of another Body, especially of another Fluid, and that\r\nis, by procuring the Coalition of several Particles that before lay too\r\nScatter'd and Dispers'd to exhibit the Colour that afterwards appears. Thus\r\nsometimes when I have had a Solution of Gold so Dilated, that I doubted\r\nwhether the Liquor had really Imbib'd any true Gold or no, by pouring in a\r\nlittle _Mercury_, I have been quickly able to satisfie my Self, that the\r\nLiquor contain'd Gold, that Mettall after a little while Cloathing the\r\nSurface of the _Quick-silver_, with a Thin Film of its own Livery. And\r\nchiefly, though not only by this way of bringing the Minute parts of Bodies\r\ntogether in such Numbers as to make them become Notorious to the Eye, many\r\nof these Colours seem to be Generated which are produc'd by Precipitations,\r\nespecially by such as are wont to be made with fair Water, as when Resinous\r\nGumms dissolv'd in Spirit of Wine, are let fall again, if the Spirit be\r\nCopiously diluted with that weakning Liquor. And so out of the Rectify'd\r\nand Transparent Butter of _Antimony_, by the bare Mixture of fair Water,\r\nthere will be plentifully Precipitated that Milk-white Substance, which by\r\nhaving its Looser Salts well wash'd off, is turn'd into that Medicine,\r\nwhich Vulgar _Chymists_ are pleas'd to call _Mercurius Vitæ._\r\n\r\n23. A fifth way, by which a Liquor may change the Colour of a Body, is, by\r\nDislocating the Parts, and putting them out of their former Order into\r\nanother, and perhaps also altering the Posture of the single Corpuscles as\r\nwell as their Order or Situation in respect of one another. What certain\r\nKinds of Commotion or Dislocation of the Parts of a Body may do towards the\r\nChanging its Colour, is not only evident in the Mutations of Colour\r\nobservable in _Quick-silver_, and some other Concretes long kept by\r\n_Chymists_ in a Convenient Heat, though in close Vessels, but in the\r\nObvious Degenerations of Colour, which every Body may take notice of in\r\nBruis'd Cherries, and other Fruit, by comparing after a while the Colour of\r\nthe Injur'd with that of the Sound part of the same Fruit. And that also\r\nsuch Liquors, as we have been speaking of, may greatly Discompose the\r\nTextures of many Bodies, and thereby alter the Disposition of their\r\nSuperficial parts, the great Commotion made in Metalls, and several other\r\nBodies by _Aqua-fortis_, Oyl of _Vitriol_, and other Saline _Menstruums_,\r\nmay easily perswade us, and what such Vary'd Situations of Parts may do\r\ntowards the Diversifying of the manner of their Reflecting the Light, may\r\nbe Guess'd in some Measure by the Beating of Transparent Glass into a White\r\nPowder, but farr better by the Experiments lately Pointed at, and hereafter\r\nDeliver'd, as the Producing and Destroying Colours by the means of subtil\r\nSaline Liquors, by whose Affusion the Parts of other Liquors are manifestly\r\nboth Agitated, and likewise Dispos'd after another manner than they were\r\nbefore such Affusion. And in some _Chymical_ Oyls, as particularly that of\r\nLemmon Pills, by barely Shaking the Glass, that holds it, into Bubbles,\r\nthat Transposition of the Parts which is consequent to the Shaking, will\r\nshew you on the Surfaces of the Bubbles exceeding Orient and Lively\r\nColours, which when the Bubbles relapse into the rest of the Oyl, do\r\nimmediately Vanish.\r\n\r\n24. I know not, _Pyrophilus_, whether I should mention as a Distinct way,\r\nbecause it is of a somewhat more General Nature, that Power, whereby a\r\nLiquor may alter the Colour of another Body, by putting the Parts of it\r\ninto Motion; For though possibly the Motion so produc'd, does, as such,\r\nseldome suddenly change the Colour of the Body whose Parts are Agitated,\r\nyet this seems to be one of the most General, however not Immediate causes\r\nof the Quick change of Colours in Bodies. For the Parts being put into\r\nMotion by the adventitious Liquor, divers of them that were before United,\r\nmay become thereby Disjoyn'd, and when that Motion ceases or decays others\r\nof them may stick together, and that in a new Order, by which means the\r\nMotion may sometimes produce Permanent changes of Colours, as in the\r\nExperiment you will meet with hereafter, of presently turning a Snowy White\r\nBody into a Yellow, by the bare Affusion of fair Water, which probably so\r\nDissolves the Saline Corpuscles that remain'd in the _Calx_, and sets them\r\nat Liberty to Act upon one another, and the Metall, far more Powerfully\r\nthan the Water without the Assistance of such Saline Corpuscles could do.\r\nAnd though you rubb Blew _Vitriol_, how Venereal and Unsophisticated soever\r\nit be, upon the Whetted Blade of a Knife, it will not impart to the Iron\r\nits Latent Colour, but if you moisten the _Vitriol_ with your Spittle, or\r\ncommon Water, the Particles of the Liquor disjoyning those of the\r\n_Vitriol_, and thereby giving them the Various Agitation requisite to Fluid\r\nBodies, the Metalline Corpuscles of the thus Dissolv'd _Vitriol_ will Lodge\r\nthemselves in Throngs in the Small and Congruous Pores of the Iron they are\r\nRubb'd on, and so give the Surface of it the Genuine Colour of the Copper.\r\n\r\n25. There remains yet a way, _Pyrophilus_ to be mention'd, by which a\r\nLiquor may alter the Colour of another Body, and this seems the most\r\nImportant of all, because though it be nam'd but as One, yet it may indeed\r\ncomprehend Many, and that is, by Associating the Saline Corpuscles, or any\r\nother Sort of the more Rigid ones of the Liquor, with the Particles of the\r\nBody that it is employ'd to Work upon. For these Adventitious Corpuscles\r\nAssociating themselves with the Protuberant Particles of the Surface of a\r\nColour'd Body, must necessarily alter their Bigness, and will most commonly\r\nalter their Shape. And how much the Colours of Bodies depend upon the Bulk\r\nand Figure of their Superficial Particles, you may Guess by this, that\r\neminent antient _Philosophers_ and divers _Moderns_, have thought that all\r\nColours might in a general way be made out by these two; whose being\r\nDiversify'd, will in our Case be attended with these two Circumstances, the\r\nOne, that the Protuberant Particles being Increas'd in Bulk, they will\r\noftentimes be Vary'd as to the Closness or Laxity of their Order, fewer of\r\nthem being contain'd within the same Sensible (though Minute) space than\r\nbefore; or else by approaching to one another, they must Straighten the\r\nPores, and it may be too, they will by their manner of Associating\r\nthemselves with the Protuberant Particles, intercept new Pores. And this\r\ninvites me to consider farther, that the Adventitious Corpuscles, I have\r\nbeen speaking of, may likewise produce a great Change as well in the Little\r\nCavities or Pores as in the Protuberances of a Colour'd Body; for besides\r\nwhat we have just now taken notice of, they may by Lodging themselves in\r\nthose little Cavities, fill them up, and it may well happen, that they may\r\nnot only fill the Pores they Insinuate themselves into, but likewise have\r\ntheir Upper Parts extant above them; and partly by these new Protuberances,\r\npartly by Increasing the Bulk of the former, these Extraneous Corpuscles\r\nmay much alter the Number and Bigness of the Surfaces Pores, changing the\r\nOld and Intercepting new ones. And then 'tis Odds, but the Order of the\r\nLittle Extancies, and consequently that of the Little Depressions in point\r\nof Situation will be alter'd likewise: as if you dissolve _Quick-silver_ in\r\nsome kind of _Aqua-fortis_, the Saline Particles of the _Menstruum_\r\nAssociating themselves with the Mercurial Corpuscles, will make a Green\r\nSolution, which afterwards easily enough Degenerates. And Red Lead or\r\n_Minium_ being Dissolv'd in Spirit of Vinegar, yields not a Red, but a\r\nClear Solution, the Redness of the Lead being by the Liquor Destroy'd. But\r\na better Instance may be taken from Copper, for I have try'd, that if upon\r\na Copper-plate you let some Drops of weak _Aqua-fortis_ rest for a while,\r\nthe Corpuscles of the _Menstruum_, joyning with those of the Metall, will\r\nproduce a very sensible Asperity upon the Surface of the Plate, and will\r\nConcoagulate that way into very minute Grains of a Pale Blew _Vitriol_;\r\nwhereas if upon another part of the same Plate you suffer a little strong\r\nSpirit of Urine to rest a competent time, you shall find the Asperated\r\nSurface adorn'd with a Deeper and Richer Blew. And the same _Aqua-fortis_,\r\nthat will quickly change the Redness of Red Lead into a Darker Colour,\r\nwill, being put upon Crude Lead, produce a Whitish Substance, as with\r\nCopper it did a Blewish. And as with Iron it will produce a Reddish, and on\r\nWhite Quills a Yellowish, so much may the Coalition of the Parts of the\r\nsame Liquor, with the differingly Figur'd Particles of Stable Bodies,\r\ndivers ways Asperate the differingly Dispos'd Surfaces, and to Diversifie\r\nthe Colour of those Bodies. And you'l easily believe, that in many changes\r\nof Colour, that happen upon the Dissolutions of Metalls, and Precipitations\r\nmade with Oyl of _Tartar_, and the like Fix'd Salts, there may Intervene a\r\nCoalition of Saline Corpuscles with the Particles of the Body Dissolv'd or\r\nPrecipitated, if you examine how much the _Vitriol_ of a Metall may be\r\nHeavier than the Metalline part of it alone, upon the Score of the Saline\r\nparts Concoagulated therewith, and, that in Several Precipitations the\r\nweight of the _Calx_ does for the same Reason much exceed that of the\r\nMetall, when it was first put in to be Dissolv'd.\r\n\r\n26. But, _Pyrophilus_, to consider these Matters more particularly would be\r\nto forget that I declar'd against Adventuring, at least for this time, at\r\nparticular Theories of Colours, and that accordingly you may justly expect\r\nfrom me rather Experiments than Speculations, and therefore I shall Dismiss\r\nthis Subject of the Forms of Superficial Asperity in Colour'd Bodies, as\r\nsoon as I shall but have nam'd to you by way of Supplement to what we have\r\nhitherto Discours'd in this Section, a Couple of Particulars, (which you'l\r\neasily grant me) The one, That there are divers other ways for the speedy\r\nProduction even of True and Permanent Colours in Bodies, besides those\r\nPracticable by the help of Liquors; for proof of which Advertisement,\r\nthough several Examples might be alleged, yet I shall need but Re-mind you\r\nof what I mention'd to you above, touching the change of Colours suddenly\r\nmade on Temper'd Steel, and on Lead, by the Operation of Heat, without the\r\nIntervention of a Liquor. But the other particular I am to observe to you\r\nis of more Importance to our present Subject and it is, That though Nature\r\nand Art may in some cases so change the Asperity of the Superficial parts\r\nof a Body, as to change its Colour by either of the ways I have propos'd\r\nSingle or Unassisted, yet for the most part 'tis by two or three, or\r\nperhaps by more of the fore-mention'd ways Associated together, that the\r\nEffect is produc'd, and if you consider how Variously those several ways\r\nand some others Ally'd unto them, which I have left unmention'd, may be\r\nCompounded and Apply'd, you will not much wonder that such fruitfull,\r\nwhether Principles (or Manners of Diversification) should be fitted to\r\nChange or Generate no small store of Differing Colours.\r\n\r\n27. Hitherto, _Pyrophilus_, we have in discoursing of the Asperity of\r\nBodies consider'd the little Protuberances of other Superficial particles\r\nwhich make up that Roughness, as if we took it for granted, that they must\r\nbe perfectly Opacous and Impenetrable by the Beams of Light, and so, must\r\ncontribute to the Variety of Colours as they terminate more or less Light,\r\nand reflect it to the Eye mix'd with more or less of thus or thus mingl'd\r\nShades. But to deal Ingenuously with you, _Pyrophilus_, before I proceed\r\nany further, I must not conceal from you, that I have often thought it\r\nworth a Serious Enquiry, whether or no Particles of Matter, each of them\r\nsing'y Insensible, and therefore small enough to be capable of being such\r\nMinute Particles as the _Atomists_ both of old and of late have (not\r\nabsurdly) called _Corpuscula Coloris_, may not yet consist each of them of\r\ndivers yet Minuter Particles, betwixt which we may conceive little\r\nCommissures where they Adhere to one another, and, however, may not be\r\nPorous enough to be, at least in some degree, Pervious to the unimaginably\r\nsubtile Corpuscles that make up the Beams of Light, and consequently to be\r\nin such a degree Diaphanous. For, _Pyrophilus_, that the proposed Enquiry\r\nmay be of moment to him that searches after the Nature of Colour, you'l\r\neasily grant, if you consider, that whereas Perfectly Opacous bodies can\r\nbut reflect the incident Beams of Light, those that are Diaphanous are\r\nqualified to refract them too, and that Refraction has such a stroak in the\r\nProduction of Colours, as you cannot but have taken notice of, and perhaps\r\nadmir'd in the Colours generated by the Trajection of Light through Drops\r\nof Water that exhibit a Rain-bow, through Prismatical glasses, and through\r\ndivers other Transparent bodies. But 'tis like, _Pyrophilus_, you'l more\r\neasily allow that about this matter 'tis rather Important to have a\r\nCertainty, than that 'tis Rational to entertain a Doubt; wherefore I must\r\nmention to you some of the Reasons that make me think it may need a further\r\nEnquiry, for I find that in a Darkned Room, where the Light is permitted to\r\nenter but at One hole, the little wandering Particles of Dust, that are\r\ncommonly called Motes, and, unless in the Sunbeams, are not taken notice of\r\nby the unassisted Sight, I have, I say, often observ'd, that these roving\r\nCorpuscles being look'd on by an Eye plac'd on one side of the Beams that\r\nenter'd the Little hole, and by the Darkness having its Pupill much\r\nEnlarg'd, I could discern that these Motes as soon as they came within the\r\ncompass of the Luminous, whether Cylinder or Inverted Cone, if I may so\r\ncall it, that was made up by the Unclouded Beams of the Sun, did in certain\r\npositions appear adorn'd with very vivid Colours, like those of the\r\nRain-bow, or rather like those of very Minute, but Sparkling fragments of\r\nDiamonds; and as soon as the Continuance of their Motion had brought them\r\nto an Inconvenient position in reference to the Light and the Eye, they\r\nwere only visible without Darting any lively Colours as before, which seems\r\nto argue that these little Motes, or minute Fragments, of several sorts of\r\nbodies reputed Opacous, and only crumbled as to their Exteriour and Looser\r\nparts into Dust, did not barely Reflect the Beams that fell upon them, but\r\nremit them to the Eye Refracted too. We may also observe, that several\r\nBodies, (as well some of a Vegetable, as others of an Animal nature) which\r\nare wont to pass for Opacous, appear in great part Transparent, when they\r\nare reduc'd into Thin parts, and held against a powerful Light. This I have\r\nnot only taken notice of in pieces of Ivory reduc'd but into Thick leaves,\r\nas also in divers considerable Thick shells of Fishes, and in shaving of\r\nWood, but I have also found that a piece of Deal, far thicker than one\r\nwould easily imagine, being purposly interposed betwixt my Eye plac'd in a\r\nRoom, and the clear Daylight, was not only somewhat Transparent, but\r\n(perhaps by reason of its Gummous nature) appear'd quite through of a\r\nlovely Red. And in the Darkned Room above mention'd, Bodies held against\r\nthe hole at which the Light enter'd, appear'd far less Opacous then they\r\nwould elsewhere have done, insomuch that I could easily and plainly see\r\nthrough the whole Thickness of my Hand, the Motions of a Body plac'd (at a\r\nvery near distance indeed, but yet) beyond it. And even in Minerals, the\r\nOpacity is not always so great as many think, if the Body be made Thin, for\r\nWhite Marble though of a pretty Thickness, being within a Due distance\r\nplac'd betwixt the Eye and a Convenient Light, will Suffer the Motions of\r\nones Finger to be well discern'd through it, and so will pieces, Thick\r\nenough, of many common Flints. But above all, that Instance is remarkable,\r\nthat is afforded us by _Muscovie_ glass, (which some call _Selenites_,\r\nothers _Lapis Specularis_) for though plates of this Mineral, though but of\r\na moderate Thickness, do often appear Opacous, yet if one of these be\r\nDextrously split into the thinnest Leaves 'tis made up of, it will yield\r\nsuch a number of them, as scarce any thing but Experience could have\r\nperswaded me, and these Leaves will afford the most Transparent sort of\r\nconsistent Bodies, that, for ought I have observ'd, are yet known; and a\r\nsingle Leaf or Plate will be so far from being Opacous, that 'twill scarce\r\nbe so much as Visible. And multitudes of Bodies there are, whose Fragments\r\nseem Opacous to the naked Eye, which yet, when I have included them in good\r\n_Microscopes_, appear'd Transparent; but, _Pyrophilus_, on the other side I\r\nam not yet sure that there are no Bodies, whose Minute Particles even in\r\nsuch a _Microscope_ as that of mine, which I was lately mentioning, will\r\nnot appear Diaphanous. For having consider'd _Mercury_ Precipitated _per\r\nse_, the little Granules that made up the powder, look'd like little\r\nfragments of Coral beheld by the naked Eye at a Distance (for very Near at\r\nhand Coral will sometimes, especially if it be Good, shew some\r\nTransparency.) Filings likewise of Steel and Copper, though in an excellent\r\n_Microscope_, and a fair Day, they show'd like pretty Big Fragments of\r\nthose Metalls, and had considerable Brightness on some of their Surfaces,\r\nyet I was not satisfi'd, that I perceiv'd any Reflection from the Inner\r\nparts of any of the Filings. Nay, having look'd in my best _Microscope_\r\nupon the Red _Calx_ of Lead, (commonly call'd _Minium_) neither I, nor any\r\nI shew'd it to, could discern it to be other than Opacous, though the Day\r\nwere Clear, and the Object strongly Enlightned. And the deeply Red Colour\r\nof _Vitriol_ appear'd in the same _Microscope_ (notwithstanding the great\r\nComminution effected by the Fire) but like Grossy beaten Brick. So that,\r\n_Pyrophilus_, I shall willingly resign you the care of making some further\r\nEnquiries into the Subject we have now been considering; for I confess, as\r\nI told you before, that I think that the Matter may need a further\r\nScrutiny, nor would I be forward to Determine how far or in what cases the\r\nTransparency or Semi-diaphaniety of the Superficial Corpuscles of Bigger\r\nBodies, may have an Interest in the Production of their Colours, especially\r\nbecause that even in divers White bodies, as Beaten Glass, Snow and Froth,\r\nwhere it seems manifest that the Superficial parts are singly Diaphanous,\r\n(being either Water, or Air, or Glass) we see not that such Variety of\r\nColours are produc'd as usually are by the Refraction of Light, even in\r\nthose Bodies, when by their Bigness, Shape, &c. they are conveniently\r\nqualify'd to exhibit such Various and Lively Colours as those of the\r\nRain-bow, and of Prismatical Glasses.\r\n\r\n28. By what has been hitherto discours'd, _Pyrophilus_, we may be assisted\r\nto judge of that famous Controversie which was of Old disputed betwixt the\r\n_Epicureans_ and other _Atomists_ on the one side, and most other\r\n_Philosophers_ on the other side. The former Denying Bodies to be Colour'd\r\nin the Dark, and the Latter making Colour to be an Inherent quality, as\r\nwell as Figure, Hardness; Weight, or the like. For though this Controversie\r\nbe Reviv'd, and hotly Agitated among the _Moderns_, yet I doubt whether it\r\nbe not in great part a Nominal dispute, and therefore let us, according to\r\nthe Doctrine formerly deliver'd, Distinguish the Acceptions of the word\r\nColour, and say, that if it be taken in the Stricter Sense, the\r\n_Epicureans_ seem to be in the Right, for if Colour be indeed, though not\r\naccording to them, but Light Modify'd, how can we conceive that it can\r\nSubsist in the Dark, that is, where it must be suppos'd there is no Light;\r\nbut on the other side, if Colour be consider'd as a certain Constant\r\nDisposition of the Superficial parts of the Object to Trouble the Light\r\nthey Reflect after such and such a Determinate manner, this Constant, and,\r\nif I may so speak, Modifying disposition persevering in the Object, whether\r\nit be Shin'd upon or no, there seems no just reason to deny, but that in\r\nthis Sense, Bodies retain their Colour as well in the Night as Day; or, to\r\nSpeak a little otherwise, it may be said, that Bodies are Potentially\r\nColour'd in the Dark, and Actually in the Light. But of this Matter\r\ndiscoursing more fully elsewhere, as 'tis a difficulty that concerns\r\nQualities in general, I shall forbear to insist on it here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV\r\n\r\n1. Of greater Moment in the Investigation of the Nature of Colours is the\r\nControversie, Whether those of the Rain-bow, and those that are often seen\r\nin Clouds, before the Rising, or after the Setting of the Sun; and in a\r\nword, Whether those other Colours, that are wont to be call'd Emphatical,\r\nought or ought not to be accounted True Colours. I need not tell you that\r\nthe Negative is the Common Opinion, especially in the Schools, as may\r\nappear by that Vulgar distinction of Colours, whereby these under\r\nConsideration are term'd Apparent, by way of Opposition to those that in\r\nthe other Member of the Distinction are call'd True or Genuine. This\r\nquestion I say seems to me of Importance, upon this Account, that it being\r\ncommonly Granted, (or however, easie enough to be Prov'd) that Emphatical\r\nColours are Light it self Modify'd by Refractions chiefly, with a\r\nconcurrence sometimes of Reflections, and perhaps some other Accidents\r\ndepending on these two; if these Emphatical Colours be resolv'd to be\r\nGenuine, it will seem consequent, that Colours, or at least divers of them,\r\nare but Diversify'd Light, and not such Real and Inherent qualities as they\r\nare commonly thought to be.\r\n\r\n2. Now since we are wont to esteem the Echoes and other Sounds of Bodies,\r\nto be True Sounds, all their Odours to be True Odours, and (to be short)\r\nsince we judge other Sensible Qualities to be True ones, because they are\r\nthe proper Objects of some or other of our Senses, I see not why Emphatical\r\nColours, being the proper and peculiar Objects of the Organ of Sight, and\r\ncapable to Affect it as Truly and as Powerfully as other Colours, should be\r\nreputed but Imaginary ones.\r\n\r\nAnd if we have (which perchance you'l allow) formerly evinc'd Colour, (when\r\nthe word is taken in its more Proper sense) to be but Modify'd Light, there\r\nwill be small Reason to deny these to be true Colours, which more\r\nmanifestly than others disclose themselves to be produc'd by\r\nDiversifications of the Light.\r\n\r\n3. There is indeed taken notice of a Difference betwixt these Apparent\r\ncolours, and those that are wont to be esteem'd Genuine, as to the\r\nDuration, which has induc'd some Learned Men to call the former rather\r\nEvanid than Fantastical. But as the Ingenious _Gassendus_ does somewhere\r\nJudiciously observe, if this way of Arguing were Good, the Greeness of a\r\nLeaf ought to pass for Apparent, because, soon Fading into a Yellow, it\r\nScarce lasts at all, in comparison of the Greeness of an Emerauld. I shall\r\nadd, that if the Sun-beams be in a convenient manner trajected through a\r\nGlass-prism, and thrown upon some well-shaded Object within a Room, the\r\nRain-bow thereby Painted on the Surface of the Body that Terminates the\r\nBeams, may oftentimes last longer than Some Colours I have produc'd in\r\ncertain Bodies, which would justly, and without scruple be accounted\r\nGenuine Colours, and yet suddenly Degenerate, and lose their Nature.\r\n\r\n4. A greater Disparity betwixt Emphatical Colours, and others, may perhaps\r\nbe taken from this, that Genuine Colours seem to be produc'd in Opacous\r\nBodies by Reflection, but Apparent ones in Diaphanous Bodies, and\r\nprincipally by Refraction, I say Principally rather than Solely, because in\r\nsome cases Reflection also may concurr, but still this seems not to\r\nconclude these Latter Colours not to be True ones. Nor must what has been\r\nnewly said of the Differences of True and Apparent Colours, be interpreted\r\nin too Unlimited a Sense, and therefore it may perhaps somewhat Assist you,\r\nboth to Reflect upon the two fore-going Objections, and to judge of some\r\nother Passages which you'l meet with in this Tract, if I take this Occasion\r\nto observe to you, that if Water be Agitated into Froth, it exhibits you\r\nknow a White colour, which soon after it Loses upon the Resolution of the\r\nBubbles into Air and Water, now in this case either the Whiteness of the\r\nFroth is a True Colour or not, if it be, then True Colours, supposing the\r\nWater pure and free from Mixtures of any thing Tenacious, may be as\r\nShort-liv'd as those of the Rain-bow; also the Matter, wherein the\r\nWhiteness did Reside, may in a few moments perfectly Lose all foot-steps or\r\nremains of it. And besides, even Diaphanous Bodies may be capable of\r\nexhibiting True Colours by Reflection, for that Whiteness is so produc'd,\r\nwe shall anon make it probable. But if on the other side it be said, that\r\nthe Whiteness of Froth is an Emphatical Colour, then it must no longer be\r\nsaid, that Fantastical Colours require a certain Position of the Luminary\r\nand the Eye, and must be Vary'd or Destroy'd by the Change thereof, since\r\nFroth appears White, whether the Sun be Rising or Setting, or in the\r\nMeridian, or any where between it and the Horizon, and from what\r\n(Neighbouring) place soever the Beholders Eye looks upon it. And since by\r\nmaking a Liquor Tenacious enough, yet without Destroying its Transparency,\r\nor Staining it with any Colour, you may give the Little Films, whereof the\r\nBubbles consist, such a Texture, as may make the Froth last very many\r\nHours, if not some Days, or even Weeks, it will render it somewhat Improper\r\nto assign Duration for the Distinguishing Character to Discriminate Genuine\r\nfrom Fantastical Colours. For such Froth may much outlast the Undoubtedly\r\ntrue Colours of some of Nature's Productions, as in that Gaudy Plant not\r\nundeservedly call'd the Mervail of _Peru_, the Flowers do often Fade, the\r\nsame Day they are Blown; And I have often seen a _Virginian_ Flower, which\r\nusually Withers within the compass of a Day; and I am credibly Inform'd,\r\nthat not far from hence a curious Herborist has a Plant, whose Flowers\r\nperish in about an Hour. But if the Whiteness of Water turn'd into Froth\r\nmust therefore be reputed Emphatical, because it appears not that the\r\nNature of the Body is Alter'd, but only that the Disposition of its Parts\r\nin reference to the Incident Light is Chang'd, why may not the Whiteness be\r\naccounted Emphatical too, which I shall shew anon to be Producible, barely\r\nby such another change in Black Horn? and yet this so easily acquir'd\r\nWhiteness seems to be as truly its Colour as the Blackness was before, and\r\nat least is more Permanent than the Greenness of Leaves, the Redness of\r\nRoses, and, in short, than the Genuine Colours of the most part of Nature's\r\nProductions. It may indeed be further Objected, that according as the Sun\r\nor other Luminous Body changes place, these Emphatical Colours alter or\r\nvanish. But not to repeat what I have just now said, I shall add, that if a\r\npiece of Cloath in a Drapers Shop (in such the Light being seldome Primary)\r\nbe variously Folded, it will appear of differing Colours, as the Parts\r\nhappen to be more Illuminated or more Shaded, and if you stretch it Flat,\r\nit will commonly exhibit some one Uniform Colour, and yet these are not\r\nwont to be reputed Emphatical, so that the Difference seems to be chiefly\r\nthis, that in the Case of the Rain-bow, and the like, the Position of the\r\nLuminary Varies the Colour, and in the Cloath I have been mentioning, the\r\nPosition of the Object does it. Nor am I forward to allow that in all Cases\r\nthe Apparition of Emphatical Colours requires a Determinate position of the\r\nEye, for if Men will have the Whiteness of Froth Emphatical, you know what\r\nwe have already Inferr'd from thence. Besides, the Sun-beams trajected\r\nthrough a Triangular Glass, after the manner lately mention'd, will, upon\r\nthe Body that Terminates them, Paint a Rain-bow, that may be seen whether\r\nthe Eye be plac'd on the Right Hand of it or the Left, or Above or Beneath\r\nit, or Before or Behind it; and though there may appear some Little\r\nVariation in the Colours of the Rain-bow, beheld from Differing parts of\r\nthe Room, yet such a Diversity may be also observ'd by an Attentive Eye in\r\nReal Colours, look'd upon under the like Circumstances, Nor will it follow,\r\nthat because there remains no Footsteps of the Colour upon the Object, when\r\nthe Prism is Remov'd, that therefore the Colour was not Real, since the\r\nLight was truly Modify'd by the Refraction and Reflection it Suffer'd in\r\nits Trajection through the Prism; and the Object in our case serv'd for a\r\nSpecular Body, to Reflect that Colour to the Eye. And that you may not be\r\nStartled, _Pyrophilus_, that I should Venture to say, that a Rough and\r\nCoiour'd Object may serve for a _Speculum_ to Reflect the Artificial\r\nRain-bow I have been mentioning, consider what usually happens in Darkned\r\nRooms, where a Wall, or other Body conveniently Situated within, may so\r\nReflect the Colours of Bodies, without the Room, that they may very clearly\r\nbe Discern'd and Distinguish'd, and yet 'tis taken for granted, that the\r\nColours seen in a Darkned Room, though they leave no Traces of themselves\r\nupon the Wall or Body that Receives them, are the True Colours of the\r\nExternal Objects, together with which the Colours of the Images are Mov'd\r\nor do Rest. And the Errour is not in the Eye, whose Office is only to\r\nperceive the Appearances of things, and which does Truly so, but in the\r\nJudging or Estimative faculty, which Mistakingly concludes that Colour to\r\nbelong to the Wall, which does indeed belong to the Object, because the\r\nWall is that from whence the Beams of Light that carry the Visible\r\n_Species_, do come in Straight Lines directly to the Eye, as for the same\r\nReason we are wont at a certain Distance from Concave Sphærical Glasses, to\r\nperswade our Selves that we see the Image come forth to Meet us, and Hang\r\nin the Air betwixt the Glass and Us, because the Reflected Beams that\r\nCompose the image cross in that place, where the Image seems to be, and\r\nthence, and not from the Glass, do in Direct Lines take their Course to the\r\nEye, and upon the like Cause it is, that divers Deceptions in Sounds and\r\nother Sensible Objects do depend, as we elsewhere declare.\r\n\r\n5. I know not, whether I need add, that I have purposely Try'd, (as you'l\r\nfind some Pages hence, and will perhaps think somewhat strange) that\r\nColours that are call'd Emphatical, because not Inherent in, the Bodies in\r\nwhich they Appear, may be Compounded with one another, as those that are\r\nconfessedly Genuine may. But when all this is said, _Pyrophilus_, I must\r\nAdvertise you, that it is but Problematically Spoken, and that though I\r\nthink the Opinion I have endeavour'd to fortifie Probable, yet a great part\r\nof our Discourse concerning Colours may be True, whether that Opinion be so\r\nor not.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n1. There are you know, _Pyrophilus_, besides those Obsolete Opinions about\r\nColours which have been long since Rejected, very Various Theories that\r\nhave each of them, even at this day, Eminent Men for its Abetters; for the\r\nPeripatetick Schools, though they dispute amongst themselves divers\r\nparticulars concerning Colours, yet in this they seem Unanimously enough to\r\nAgree, that Colours are Inherent and Real Qualities, which the Light doth\r\nbut Disclose, and not concurr to Produce. Besides there are _Moderns_, who\r\nwith a slight Variation adopt the Opinion of _Plato_, and as he would have\r\nColour to be nothing but a Kind of Flame consisting of Minute Corpuscles as\r\nit were Darted by the Object against the Eye, to whose Pores their\r\nLittleness and Figure made them congruous, so these would have Colour to be\r\nan Internal Light of the more Lucid parts of the Object, Darkned and\r\nconsequently Alter'd by the Various Mixtures of the less Luminous parts.\r\nThere are also others, who in imitation of some of the Ancient _Atomists_,\r\nmake Colour not to be Lucid steam, but yet a Corporeal _Effluvium_ issuing\r\nout of the Colour'd Body, but the Knowingst of these have of late Reform'd\r\ntheir Hypothesis, by acknowledging and adding that some External Light is\r\nnecessary to Excite, and as _they_ speak, Sollicit these Corpuscles of\r\nColour as _they_ call them, and Bring them to the Eye. Another and more\r\nprincipal Opinion of the _Modern_ Philosophers, to which this last nam'd\r\nmay by a Favourable explication be reconcil'd, is that which derives\r\nColours from the Mixture of Light and Darkness, or rather Light and\r\nShadows. And as for the _Chymists_ 'tis known, that the generality of them\r\nascribes the Origine of Colours to the Sulphureous Principle in Bodies,\r\nthough I find, as I elsewhere largely shew, that some of the Chiefest of\r\nthem derive Colours rather from Salt than Sulphur, and others, from the\r\nthird Hypostatical Principle, _Mercury_. And as for the _Cartesians_ I need\r\nnot tell you, that they, supposing the Sensation of Light to bee produc'd\r\nby the Impulse made upon the Organs of Sight, by certain extremely Minute\r\nand Solid Globules, to which the Pores of the Air and other Diaphanous\r\nbodies are pervious, endeavour to derive the Varieties of Colours from the\r\nVarious Proportion of the Direct Progress or Motion of these Globules to\r\ntheir Circumvolution or Motion about their own Centre, by which Varying\r\nProportion they are by this Hypothesis suppos'd qualify'd to strike the\r\nOptick Nerve after several Distinct manners, so to produce the perception\r\nof Differing Colours.\r\n\r\n2. Besides these six principal Hypotheses, _Pyrophilus_, there may be some\r\nothers, which though Less known, may perhaps as well as thesc deserve to be\r\ntaken into consideration by you; but that I should copiously debate any of\r\nthem at present, I presume you will not expect, if you consider the Scope\r\nof these Papers, and the Brevity I have design'd in them, and therefore I\r\nshall at this time only take notice to you in the general of two or three\r\nthings that do more peculiarly concern the Treatise you have now in your\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n3. And first, though the Embracers of the Several Hypotheses I have been\r\nnaming to you, by undertaking each Sect of them to explicate Colours\r\nindefinitely, by the particular Hypotheses they maintain, seem to hold it\r\nforth as the only Needful Theory about that Subject, yet for my part I\r\ndoubt whether any one of all these Hypotheses have a right to be admitted\r\nExclusively to all others, for I think it Probable, that Whiteness and\r\nBlackness may be explicated by Reflection alone without Refraction, as\r\nyou'l find endeavour'd in the Discourse you'l meet with e're long Of the\r\nOrigine of Whiteness and Blackness, and on the other side, since I have not\r\nfound that by any Mixture of White and True Black, (for there is a Blewish\r\nBlack which many mistake for a Genuine) there can be a Blew, a Yellow, or a\r\nRed, to name no other Colours, produced, and since we do find that these\r\nColours may be produc'd in the Glass-prism and other Transparent bodies, by\r\nthe help of Refractions, it seems that Refraction is to be taken in into\r\nthe Explication of some Colours, to whose Generation they seem to concurr,\r\neither by making a further or other Commixture of Shades with the Refracted\r\nLight, or by some other way not now to be discours'd. And as it seems not\r\nimprobable, that in case the Pores of the Air, and other Diaphanous bodies\r\nbe every where almost fill'd with such _Globuli_ as the _Cartesians_\r\nsuppose, the Various kind of Motion of these _Globuli_, may in many cases\r\nhave no small stroak in Varying our Perception of Colour, so without the\r\nSupposition of these _Globuli_, which 'tis not so easie to evince, I think\r\nwe may probably enough conceive in general, that the Eye may be Variously\r\naffected, not only by the Entire Beams of Light that fall upon it as they\r\nare such, but by the Order, and by the Degree of Swiftness, and in a word\r\nby the Manner according to which the Particles that compose each Particular\r\nBeam arrive at the Sensory, so that whatever be the Figure of the Little\r\nCorpuscles, of which the Beams of Light consist, not only the Celerity or\r\nSlowness of their Revolution or Rotation in reference to their Progressive\r\nMotion, but their more Absolute Celerity, their Direct or Undulating\r\nMotion, and other Accidents, which may attend their Appulse to the Eye, may\r\nfit them to make Differing Impressions on it.\r\n\r\n4. Secondly, For these and the like Considerations, _Pyrophilus_, I must\r\ndesire that you would look upon this little Treatise, not as a Discourse\r\nwritten Principally to maintain any of the fore-mention'd Theories,\r\nExclusively to all others, or substitute a New one of my Own, but as the\r\nbeginning of a History of Colours, upon which, when you and your Ingenious\r\nfriends shall have Enrich'd it, a Solid Theory may be safely built. But yet\r\nbecause this History is not meant barely for a Register of the things\r\nrecorded in it, but for an _Apparatus_ to a sound and comprehensitive\r\nHypothesis, I thought fit, so to temper the whole Discourse, as to make it\r\nas conducible, as conveniently I can to that End, and therefore I have not\r\nscrupled to let you see that I was willing, as to save you the labour of\r\nCultivating some Theories that I thought would never enable you to reach\r\nthe Ends you aim at, so to contract your Enquiries into a Narrow compass,\r\nfor both which purposes I thought it requisite to do these two things, the\r\n_One_, to set down some Experiments which by the help of the Reflections\r\nand Insinuations that attend them, may assist you to discover the\r\nInfirmness and Insufficiency both of the common Peripatetick Doctrine, and\r\nof the now more applauded Theory of the _Chymists_ about Colour, because\r\nthose two Doctrines having Possess'd themselves, the one of the most part\r\nof the Schools, and the other of the Esteem of the Generality ef Physicians\r\nand other Learned Men, whose Professions and Ways of Study do not exact\r\nthat they should Scrupulously examine the very First and Simplest\r\nPrinciples of Nature, I fear'd it would be to little purpose, without doing\r\nsomething to discover the Insufficiency of these Hypotheses, that I should,\r\n(which was the _Other_ thing I thought requisite for me to do) set down\r\namong my other Experiments those in the greatest Number, that may let you\r\nsee, that, till I shall be Better Inform'd, I encline to take Colour to be\r\na Modification of Light, and would invite you chiefly to Cultivate that\r\nHypothesis, and Improve it to the making out of the Generation of\r\nParticular Colours, as I have Endeavour'd to apply it to the Explication of\r\nWhiteness and Blackness.\r\n\r\n5. Thirdly. But, _Pyrophilus_, though this be at present the Hypothesis I\r\npreferr, yet I propose it but in a General Sense, teaching only that the\r\nBeams of Light, Modify'd by the Bodies whence they are sent (Reflected or\r\nRefracted) to the Eye, produce there that Kind of Sensation, Men commonly\r\ncall Colour; But whether I think this Modification of the Light to be\r\nperform'd by Mixing it with Shades, or by Varying the Proportion of the\r\nProgress and Rotation of the _Cartesian Globuli Cælestes_, or by some other\r\nway which I am not now to mention, I pretend not here to Declare. Much less\r\ndo I pretend to Determine, or scarce so much as to Hope to know all that\r\nwere requisite to be Known, to give You, or even my Self, a perfect account\r\nof the Theory of Vision and Colours, for in Order to such an undertaking I\r\nwould first Know what Light is, and if it be a Body (as a Body or the\r\nMotion of a Body it seems to be) what Kind of Corpuscles for Size and Shape\r\nit consists of, with what Swiftness they move Forwards, and Whirl about\r\ntheir own Centres. Then I would Know the Nature of Refraction, which I take\r\nto be one of the Abstrusest things (not to explicate Plausibly, but to\r\nexplicate Satisfactorily) that I have met with in Physicks; I would further\r\nKnow what Kind and what Degree of Commixture of Darkness or Shades is made\r\nby Refractions or Reflections, or both, in the Superficial particles of\r\nthose Bodies, that being Shin'd upon, constantly exhibit the one, for\r\nInstance, a Blew, the other a Yellow, the third a Red Colour; I would\r\nfurther Know why this Contemperation of Light and Shade, that is made, for\r\nExample, by the Skin of a Ripe Cherry, should exhibit a Red, and not a\r\nGreen, and the Leaf of the same Tree should exhibit a Green rather than a\r\nRed; and indeed, Lastly, why since the Light that is Modify'd into these\r\nColours consists but of Corpuscles moved against the _Retina_ or Pith of\r\nthe Optick Nerve, it should there not barely give a Stroak, but produce a\r\nColour, whereas a Needle wounding likewise the Eye, would not produce\r\nColour but Pain. These, and perhaps other things I should think requisite\r\nto be Known, before I should judge my Self to have fully Comprehended the\r\nTrue and Whole Nature of Colours; and therefore, though by making the\r\nExperiments and Reflections deliver'd in this Paper, I have endeavour'd\r\nsomewhat to Lessen my Ignorance in this Matter, and think it far more\r\nDesireable to discover a Little, than to discover Nothing, yet I pretend\r\nbut to make it Probable by the Experiments I mention, that some Colours may\r\nbe Plausibly enough Explicated in the General by the Doctrine here\r\npropos'd; For whensoever I would Descend to the Minute and Accurate\r\nExplication of Particulars, I find my Self very Sensible of the great\r\nObscurity of things, without excepting those which we never see but when\r\nthey are Enlightned, and confess with _Scaliger_[5], _Latet natura hæc_,\r\n(says he, Speaking of that of Colour) _& sicut aliarum rerum species in\r\nprofundissima caligine inscitiæ humanæ._\r\n\r\n  [5] Exercitat. 325 Parag. 4\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      _THE_\r\n             _EXPERIMENTAL HISTORY_\r\n                  _OF COLOURS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    PART. II.\r\n\r\n         _Of the Nature of Whiteness and_\r\n                   _Blackness._\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\n1. Though after what I have acknowledged, _Pyrophilus_, of the Abstruse\r\nNature of Colours in _particular_, you will easily believe, that I pretend\r\nnot to give you a Satisfactory account of Whiteness and Blackness; Yet not\r\nwholly to frustrate your Expectation of my offering something by way of\r\nSpecimen towards the Explication of some Colours in particular, I shall\r\nmake choice of These as the most Simple Ones, (and by reason of their\r\nmutual Opposition the Least hardly explicable) about which to present you\r\nmy Thoughts, upon condition you will take them at most to be my\r\nConjectures, not my Opinions.\r\n\r\n2. When I apply'd my Self to consider, how the cause of Whiteness might be\r\nexplan'd by Intelligible and Mechanical Principles, I remembred not to have\r\nmet with any thing among the Antient _Corpuscularian_ Philosophers,\r\ntouching the Quality we call Whiteness, save that _Democritus_ is by\r\n_Aristotle_ said to have ascrib'd the Whiteness of Bodies to their\r\nSmoothness, and on the contrary their Blackness to their Asperity.[6] But\r\nthough about the Latter of those Qualities his Opinion be allowable, as we\r\nshall see anon, yet that he heeds a Favourable Interpretation in what is\r\nDeliver'd concerning the First, (at least if his Doctrine be not\r\nMis-represented in this point, as it has been in many others) we shall\r\nquickly have Occasion to manifest. But amongst the _Moderns_, the most\r\nLearned _Gassendus_ in his Ingenious Epistle publish'd in the Year 1642.\r\n_De apparente Magnitudine solis humilis & sublimis_, reviving the\r\n_Atomical_ Philosophy, has, though but Incidentally, deliver'd something\r\ntowards the Explication of Whiteness upon Mechanical Principles: And\r\nbecause no Man that I know of, has done so before him, I shall, to be sure\r\nto do him Right, give you his Sense in his own Words:[7] _Cogites velim_\r\n(says he) _lucem quidem in Diaphano nullius coloris videri, sed in Opaco\r\ntamen terminante Candicare, ac tantò magis, quantò densior seu collectior\r\nfuerit. Deinde aquam non esse quidem coloris ex se candidi & radium tamen\r\nex eâ reflexum versus oculum candicare. Rursus cum plana aquæ Superficies\r\nnon nisi ex una parte eam reflexionem faciat: si contigerit tamen illam in\r\naliquot bullas intumescere, bullam unamquamque reflectionem facere, &\r\ncandoris speciem creare certa Superficiei parte. Ad hæc Spumam ex aqua pura\r\nnon alia ratione videri candescere & albescerere quam quod sit congeries\r\nconfertissima minutissimarum bullarum, quarum unaquæque suum radium\r\nreflectit, unde continens candor alborve apparet. Denique Nivem nihil aliud\r\nvideri quam speciem purissimæ spumæ ex bullulis quam minutissimis &\r\nconfertissimis cohærentis. Sed ridiculam me exhibeam, si tales meas nugas\r\nuberius proponem._\r\n\r\n  [6] _Album quippe & agrum, hoc quidem asperum esse dicit, hoc vero læve.\r\n  de Sensu & Sensib. 3. 3._\r\n\r\n  [7] Epist. 2. pag. 45.\r\n\r\n3. But though in this passage, that very Ingenous Person has Anticipated\r\npart of what I should say; Yet I presume you will for all that expect, that\r\nI should give you a fuller Account of that Notion of Whiteness, which I\r\nhave the least Exceptions to, and of the Particulars whence I deduce it,\r\nwhich to do, I must mention to you the following Experiments and\r\nObservations.\r\n\r\nWhiteness then consider'd as a Quality in the Object, seems chiefly to\r\ndepend upon this, That the Superficies of the Body that is call'd White, is\r\nAsperated by almost innumerable Small Surfaces, which being of an almost\r\nSpecular Nature, are also so Plac'd, that some Looking this way, and some\r\nthat way, they yet Reflect the Rays of Light that fall on them, not towards\r\none another, but outwards towards the Spectators Eye. In this Rude and\r\nGeneral account of Whiteness, it seems that besides those Qualities, which\r\nare common to Bodies of other Colours, as for instance the Minuteness and\r\nNumber of the Superficial parts, the two chief things attributed to Bodies\r\nas White are made to be, First, that its Little Protuberances and\r\nSuperficial parts be of somewhat a Specular Nature, that they may as little\r\nLooking-glasses each of them Reflect the Beams it receives, (or the little\r\nPicture of the Sun made on it) without otherwise considerably Altering\r\nthem; whereas in most other Colours, they are wont to be much Chang'd, by\r\nbeing also Refracted, or by being Return'd to the Eye, mixt with Shades or\r\notherwise. And next, that its Superficial parts be so Situated, that they\r\nRetain not the Incident Rays of Light by Reflecting them Inwards, but Send\r\nthem almost all Back, so that the Outermost Corpuscles of a White Body,\r\nhaving their Various Little Surfaces of a Specular Nature, a Man can from\r\nno place Behold the Body, but that there will be among those Innumerable\r\n_Superficieculæ_, that Look some one way, and some another, enough of them\r\nObverted to his Eye, to afford like a broken Looking-glass, a confused\r\nIdæa, or Representation of Light, and make such an Impression on the Organ,\r\nas that for which Men are wont to call a Body White. But this Notion will\r\nperhaps be best Explan'd by the same Experiments and Observations, on which\r\nit is Built, And therefore I shall now advance to _Them_.\r\n\r\n4. And in the first place I consider, that the Sun and other Powerfully\r\nLucid Bodies, are not only wont to Offend, which we call to Dazle our Eyes,\r\nbut that if any Colour be to be Ascrib'd to them as they are Lucid, it\r\nseems it should be Whiteness: For the Sun at Noon-day, and in Clear\r\nweather, and when his Face is less Troubled, and as it were Stained by the\r\nSteams of Sublunary Bodies, and when his Beams have much less of the\r\nAtmosphere to Traject in their Passage to our Eyes, appears of a Colour\r\nmore approaching to White, than when nearer the Horizon, the Interposition\r\nof certain Sorts of Fumes and Vapours make him oftentimes appear either\r\nRed, or at least more Yellow. And when the Sun Shines upon that Natural\r\nLooking-glass, a Smooth water, that part of it, which appears to this or\r\nthat particular Beholder, the most Shin'd on, does to his Eye seem far\r\nWhiter than the rest. And here I shall add, that I have sometimes had the\r\nOpportunity to observe a thing, that may make to my present purpose,\r\nnamely, that when the Sun was Veil'd over as it were, with a Thin White\r\nCloud, and yet was too Bright to be Look'd upon Directly without Dazling,\r\nby casting my Eyes upon a Smooth water, as we sometimes do to observe\r\nEclipses without prejudice to our Eyes, the Sun then not far from the\r\nMeridian, appear'd to me not Red, but so White, that 'twas not without some\r\nWonder, that I made the Observation. Besides, though we in _English_ are\r\nwont to say, a thing is Red hot, as an Expression of its being\r\nSuperlatively _Ignitum_, (if I may so Speak for want of a proper _English_\r\nword) yet in the Forges of Smiths, and the Furnaces of other Artificers, by\r\nthat which they call a White heat, they mean a further Degree of\r\n_Ignition_, than by that which both they and we call a Red heat.\r\n\r\n5. Secondly, I consider, that common Experience informs us, that as much\r\nLight Over-powers the Eye, so when the Ground is covered with Snow, (a Body\r\nextremely White) those that have Weak Eyes are wont to complain of too much\r\nLight: And even those that have not, are generally Sensible of an\r\nExtraordinary measure of Light in the Air; and if they are fain to Look\r\nvery long upon the Snow, find their Sight Offended by it. On which occasion\r\nwe may call to mind what _Xenophon_ relates, that his _Cyrus_ marching his\r\nArmy for divers days through Mountains covered with Snow, the Dazling\r\nsplendor of its Whiteness prejudic'd the Sight of very many of his\r\nSouldiers, and Blinded some of them; and other Stories of that Nature be\r\nmet with in Writers of good Note. And the like has been affirm'd to me by\r\ncredible Persons of my own Acquaintance, and especially by one who though\r\nSkill'd in Physick and not Ancient confess'd to me when I purposely ask'd\r\nhim, that not only during his stay in _Muscovy_, he found his Eyes much\r\nImpair'd, by being reduc'd frequently to Travel in the Snow, but that the\r\nWeakness of his Eyes did not Leave him when he left that Country, but has\r\nfollow'd him into these Parts, and yet continues to Trouble him. And to\r\nthis doth agree what I as well as others have observ'd, namely, that when I\r\nTravell'd by Night, when the Ground was all cover'd with Snow, though the\r\nNight otherwise would not have been Lightsome, yet I could very well see to\r\nChoose my way. But much more Remarkable to my present purpose is that,\r\nwhich I have met with in _Olaus Magnus_,[8] concerning the way of\r\nTravelling in Winter in the _Northern_ Regions, where the Days of that\r\nSeason are so very Short; for after other things not needfull to be here\r\nTranscribed: _Iter_, says he, _Diurnum duo scilicet montana milliaria (quæ\r\n12 Italica sunt) consiciunt. Nocte verò sub splendissima luna, duplatum\r\niter consumunt aut triplatum. Neque id incommodè fit, cum nivium\r\nreverberatione lunaris splendoris sublimes & declives campos illustret, ac\r\netiam montium præcipitia ac noxias feras à lorgè prospiciant evitandas_.\r\nWhich Testimony I the less Scruple to allege, because that it agrees very\r\nwell with what has been Affirm'd to me by a Physician of _Mosco_, whom the\r\nNotion I have been Treating of concerning Whiteness invited me to ask\r\nwhether he could not See much farther when he Travell'd by Night in\r\n_Russia_ than he could do in _England_, or elsewhere, when there was no\r\nSnow upon the Ground; For this Ingenious Person inform'd me, that he could\r\nSee Things at a farr greater Distance, and with more Clearness, when he\r\nTravell'd by Night on the _Russian_ Snow, though without the Assistance of\r\nMoon-shine, than we in these Parts would easily be perswaded. Though it\r\nseems not unlikely to me, that the Intenseness of the Cold may contribute\r\nsomething to the considerableness of the Effect, by much Clearing the Air\r\nof Darkish Steams, which in these more Temperate Climates are wont to\r\nThicken it in Snowy weather: For having purposely inquir'd of this Doctor,\r\nand consulted that Ingenious Navigator Captain _James_'s Voyage hereafter\r\nto be further mention'd, I find both their Relations agree in this, that in\r\nDark Frosty Nights they could Discover more Stars, and See the rest Clearer\r\nthan we in _England_ are wont to do.\r\n\r\n  [8] Gent. Septen. Histor. lib. 4 cap. 13.\r\n\r\n6. I know indeed that divers Learned Men think, that Snow so strongly\r\nAffects our Eye, not by a Borrow'd, but a Native Light; But I venture to\r\ngive it as a Proof, that White Bodies reflect more Light than Others,\r\nbecause having once purposely plac'd a parcel of Snow in a Room carefully\r\nDarkned, that no Celestial Light might come to fall upon it; neither I, nor\r\nan ingenous Person, (Skill'd in Opticks) whom I desir'd for a Witness,\r\ncould find, that it had any other Light than what it receiv'd. And however,\r\n'tis usual among those that Travel in Dark Nights, that the Guides wear\r\nsomething of White to be Discern'd by, there being scarce any Night so\r\nDark, but that in the Free Air there remains some Light, though Broken and\r\nDebilitated perhaps by a thousand Reflections from the Opacous Corpuscles\r\nthat Swim in the Air, and lend it to one another before it comes to arrive\r\nat the Eye.\r\n\r\n7. Thirdly, And the better to shew that White Bodies reflect store of\r\nLight, in comparson of those that are otherwise Colour'd, I did in the\r\nDarkn'd Room, formerly mention'd, hold not far from the Hole, at which the\r\nLight was admitted, a Sheet only of White Paper, from whence casting the\r\nSun-beams upon a White Wall, whereunto it was Obverted, it manifestly\r\nappear'd both to Me, and to the Person I took for a Witness of the\r\nExperiment, that it Reflected a far greater Light, than any of the other\r\nColours formerly mention'd, the Light so thrown upon one Wall notably\r\nEnlightning it, and by it a good part of the Room. And yet further to show\r\nyou, that White Bodies Reflect the Beams From them, and not Towards\r\nthemselves, Let me add, that Ordinary Burning-glasses, such as are wont to\r\nbe employ'd to light Tobacco, will not in a great while Burn, or so much as\r\nDiscolour a Sheet of White Paper. Insomuch that even when I was a Boy, and\r\nLov'd to make Tryals with Burning-glasses, I could not but wonder at this\r\nOdd _Phænomenon_, which set me very Early upon Guessing at the Nature of\r\nWhiteness, especially because I took notice, that the Image of the Sun upon\r\na White Paper was not so well Defin'd (the Light seeming too Diffus'd) as\r\nupon Black, and because I try'd, that Blacking over the Paper with Ink, not\r\nonly the Ink would be quickly Dry'd up, but the Paper that I could not Burn\r\nbefore, would be quickly set on Fire. I have also try'd, that by exposing\r\nmy Hand with a Thin Black Glove over it to the Warm Sun, it was thereby\r\nvery quickly and considerably more Heated, than if I took off the Glove,\r\nand held my Hand Naked, or put on it another Glove of Thin but White\r\nLeather. And having thus shewn you, _Pyrophilus_, that White Bodies reflect\r\nthe most Light of any, let us now proceed, to consider what is further to\r\nbe taken notice of in them, in order to our present Enquiry.\r\n\r\n8. And Fourthly, whereas among the Dispositions we attributed to White\r\nBodies, we also intimated this, That such Bodies are apt, like _Speculums_,\r\nthough but Imperfect ones, to Reflect the Light that falls on them\r\nUntroubled or Unstain'd, we shall besides other particulars to be met with\r\nin these Papers, offer you this in favour of the Conjecture; That in the\r\nDarkned Room several times mention'd in this Treatse, we try'd that the\r\nSun-beams being cast from a Coloured Body upon a neighbouring White Wall,\r\nthe Determinate Colour of the Body was from the Wall reflected to the Eye;\r\nwhereas we could in divers cases manifestly Alter the Colour arriving at\r\nthe Eye, by Substituting at a convenient Distance, a (conveniently)\r\nColour'd (and Glossy) Body instead of the White Wall. As by throwing the\r\nBeams from a Yellow Body upon a Blew, there would be Exhibited a kind of\r\nGreen, as in the Experiments about Colours is more fully Declar'd.\r\n\r\n9. I know not whether I should on this Occasion take notice, that when, as\r\nwhen looking upon the Calm and Smooth Surface of a River betwixt my Eye and\r\nthe Sun, it appear'd to be a natural _Speculum_, wherein that Part which\r\nReflected to my Eye the Entire and defin'd Image of the Sun, and the Beams\r\nless remote from those which exhibited That Image, appear'd indeed of a\r\ngreat and Whitish Brightness, but the rest Comparatively Dark enough: if\r\nafterwards the Superficies chanc'd to be a little, but not much troubled,\r\nby a gentle Breath of Wind, and thereby reduc'd into a Multitude of Small\r\nand Smooth _Speculums_, the Surface of the River would suitably to the\r\nDoctrine lately deliver'd, at a Distance appear very much of Kin to White,\r\nthough it would lose that Brightness or Whiteness upon the Return of the\r\nSurface to Calmness and an Uniform Level. And I have sometimes for Tryals\r\nsake brought in by a Lenticular Glass, the Image of a River, Shin'd upon by\r\nthe Sun, into an Upper Room Darkn'd, and Distant about a Quarter of a Mile\r\nfrom the River, by which means the Numerous Declining Surfaces of the Water\r\nappear'd so Contracted, that upon the Body that receiv'd the Images, the\r\nwhole River appear'd a very White Object at two or three paces distance.\r\nBut if we drew Near it, this Whiteness appear'd to proceed from an\r\nInnumerable company of Lucid Reflections, from the several Gently wav'd\r\nSuperficies of the Water, which look'd Near at hand like a Multitude of\r\nvery Little, but Shining Scales of Fish, of which many did every moment\r\nDisappear, and as many were by the Sun, Wind and River generated anew. But\r\nthough this Observation seem'd Sufficiently to discover, how the Appearing\r\nWhiteness in that case was Produc'd, yet in some other cases Water may have\r\nthe Same, though not so Vivid a Colour upon other Accounts; for oftentimes\r\nit happens that the Smooth Surface of the Water does appear Bright or\r\nWhitish, by reason of the Reflection not immediatly of the Images of the\r\nSun, but of the Brightness of the Sky; and in such cases a Convenient Wind\r\nmay where it passes along make the Surface look Black, by causing many such\r\nFurrows and Cavities, as may make the Inflected Superficies of the Water\r\nreflect the Brightness of the Sky rather Inward than Outward. And again if\r\nthe Wind increase into a Storm, the Water may appear White, especially near\r\nthe Shore and the Ship, namely because the Rude Agitation Breaks it into\r\nFome or Froth. So much do Whiteness and Blackness depend upon the\r\nDisposition of the Superficial parts of a Body to Reflect the Beams of\r\nLight Inward or Outward. But that as White Bodies reflect the most Light of\r\nany, so there Superficial Particles are, in the Sense newly Deliver'd, of a\r\nSpecular Nature, I shall now further endeavour to shew both by the making\r\nof Specular bodies White, and the making of a White body Specular.\r\n\r\n10. In the Fifth place then, I will inform You, that (not to repeat what\r\n_Gassendus_ observes concerning Water) I have for Curiosity sake Distill'd\r\nQuicksilver in a Cucurbit, fitted with a Capacious Glass-head, and observ'd\r\nthat when the Operation was perform'd by the Degrees of Fire requisite for\r\nmy purpose, there would stick to the Inside of the Alembick a multitude of\r\nLittle round drops of _Mercury_. And as you know that _Mercury_ is a\r\nSpecular Body, so each of these Little drops was a small round\r\nLooking-glass, and a Multitude of them lying Thick and Near one another,\r\nthey did both in my Judgment, and that of those I Invited to see it, make\r\nthe Glass they were fastened to, appear manifestly a White Body. And yet as\r\nI said, this Whiteness depended upon the Minuteness and Nearness of the\r\nLittle Mercurial _Globuli_, the Convexity of whose Surfaces fitted them to\r\nrepresent in a Narrow compass a Multitude of Little Lucid Images to\r\ndifferingly situated Beholders. And here let me observe a thing that seems\r\nmuch to countenance the Notion I have been recommending: namely, that\r\nwhereas divers parts of the Sky, and especially the Milky-way, do to the\r\nnaked Eye appear White, (as the name it self imports) yet the Galaxie\r\nlook'd upon through the Telescope, does not shew White, but appears to be\r\nmade up of a Vast multitude of Little Starrs; so that a Multitude of Lucid\r\nBodies, if they be so Small that they cannot Singly or apart be discern'd\r\nby the Eye, and if they be sufficiently Thick set by one another, may by\r\ntheir confus'd beams appear to the Eye One White Body. And why it is not\r\npossible, that the like may be done, when a Multitude of Bright and Little\r\nCorpuscles being crowded together, are made to send together Vivid beams to\r\nthe Eye, though they Shine but as the Planets by a Borrow'd Light?\r\n\r\n\r\n11. But to return to our Experiments. We may take notice, That the White of\r\nan Egg, though in part Transparent, yet by its power of Reflecting some\r\nIncident Rays of Light, is in some measure a Natural _Speculum_, being long\r\nagitated with a Whisk or Spoon, loses its Transparency, and becomes very\r\nWhite, by being turn'd into Froth, that is into an Aggregate of Numerous\r\nsmall Bubbles, whose Convex Superficies fits them to Reflect the Light\r\nevery way Outwards. And 'tis worth Noting, that when Water, for instance,\r\nis Agitated into Froth, if the Bubbles be Great and Few, the Whiteness will\r\nbe but Faint, because the number of _Specula_ within a Narrow compass is\r\nbut Small, and they are not Thick set enough to Reflect so Many Little\r\nImages or Beams of the Lucid Body, as are requisite to produce a Vigorous\r\nsensation of Whiteness: And partly least it should be said, that the\r\nWhiteness of such Globulous Particles proceeds from the Air Included in the\r\nFroth; (which to make good, it should be prov'd that the Air it self is\r\nWhite) and partly to illustrate the better the Notion we have propos'd of\r\nWhiteness, I shall add, that I purposely made this Experiment, I took a\r\nquantity Fair water, & put to it in a clear Glass phial, a convenient\r\nquantity of Oyl or Spirit of Turpentine, because that Liquor will not\r\nincorporate with Water, and yet is almost as Clear and Colourless as it;\r\nthese being Gently Shaken together, the Agitation breaks the Oyl (which as\r\nI said, is Indispos'd to Mix like Wine or Milk _per minima_ with the Water)\r\ninto a Multitude of Little Globes, which each of them Reflecting Outwards a\r\nLucid Image, make the Imperfect Mixture of the two Liquors appear Whitish;\r\nbut if by Vehemently Shaking the Glass for a competent time you make a\r\nfurther Comminution of the Oyl into far more Numerous and Smaller\r\n_Globuli_, and thereby confound it also better with the Water, the Mixture\r\nwill appear of a Much greater Whiteness, and almost like Milk; whereas if\r\nthe Glass be a while let alone, the Colour will by degrees Impair, as the\r\nOyly globes grow Fewer and Bigger, and at length will quite Vanish, leaving\r\nboth the Liquors Distinct and Diaphanous as before. And such a Tryal hath\r\nnot ill succeeded, when insteed of the Colourless Oyl of Turpentine I took\r\na Yellow Mixture made of a good Proportion of Crude Turpentine dissolv'd in\r\nthat Liquor; and (if I mis-remember not) it also Succeeded better than one\r\nwould expect, when I employ'd an Oyl brought by Filings of Copper infused\r\nin it, to a deep Green. And this (by the way) may be the Reason, why often\r\ntimes when the Oyls of some Spices and of Anniseeds &c. are Distilled in a\r\nLimbec with Water, the Water (as I have several times observ'd) comes over\r\nWhitish, and will perhaps continue so for a good while, because if the Fire\r\nbe made too Strong, the subtile Chymical Oyl is thereby much Agitated and\r\nBroken, and Blended with the Water in such Numerous and Minute Globules, as\r\ncannot easily in a short time Emerge to the Top of the Water, and whilst\r\nthey Remain in it, make it, for the Reason newly intimated, look Whitish;\r\nand perhaps upon the same Ground a cause may be rendred, why Hot water is\r\nobserv'd to be usually more Opacous and Whitish, than the same Water Cold,\r\nthe Agitation turning the more Spirituous or otherwise Conveniently\r\nDispos'd Particles of the Water into Vapours, thereby Producing in the Body\r\nof the Liquor a Multitude of Small Bubbles, which interrupt the Free\r\npassage, that the Beams of Light would else have Every way, and from the\r\nInnermost parts of the Water Reflect many of them Outwards. These and the\r\nlike Examples, _Pyrophilus_, have induc'd me to Suspect, that the\r\nSuperficial Particles of White bodies, may for the Most part be as well\r\nConvex as Smooth; I content my self to say _Suspect_ and _for the most\r\npart_, because it seems not Easie to prove, that when Diaphanous bodies, as\r\nwe shall see by and by, are reduc'd into White Powders, each Corpuscle must\r\nneeds be of a Convex Superficies, since perhaps it may Suffice that\r\nSpecular Surfaces look severally ways. For (as we have seen) when a\r\nDiaphanous Body comes to be reduc'd to very Minute parts, it thereby\r\nrequires a Multitude of Little Surfaces within a Narrow compass. And though\r\neach of these should not be of a Figure Convenient to Reflect a Round Image\r\nof the Sun, yet even from such an Inconveniently Figur'd body, there may be\r\nReflected some (either Streight or Crooked) Physical Line of Light, which\r\nLine I call Physical, because it has some Breadth in it, and in which Line\r\nin many cases some Refraction of the Light falling upon the Body it depends\r\non, may contribute to the Brightness, as if a Slender Wire, or Solid\r\nCylinder of Glass be expos'd to the Light, you shall see in some part of it\r\na vivid Line of Light, and if we were able to draw out and lay together a\r\nMultitude of these Little Wires or Thrids of Glass, so Slender, that the\r\nEye could not discern a Distance betwixt the Luminous Lines, there is\r\nlittle doubt (as far as I can guess by a Tryal purposely made with very\r\nSlender, but far less Slender Thrids of Glass, whose Aggregate was Look'd\r\nupon one way White) but the whole Physical Superficies compos'd of them,\r\nwould to the Eye appear White, and if so, it will not be always necessary\r\nthat the Figure of those Corpuscles, that make a Body appear White, should\r\nbe _Globulous_. And as for Snow it self, though the Learned _Gassendus_ (as\r\nwe have seen above) makes it to seem nothing else but a pure Frozen Froth,\r\nconsisting of exceedingly Minute and Thickset Bubbles; yet I see no\r\nnecessity of Admitting that, since not only by the Variously and Curiously\r\nFigur'd Snow, that I have divers times had the Opportunity with Pleasure to\r\nobserve, but also by the Common Snow, it rather doth appear both to the\r\nNaked Eye, and in a _Microscope_, often, if not most commonly, to consist\r\nprincipally of Little Slender Icicles of several Shapes, which afford such\r\nNumerous Lines of Light, as we have been newly Speaking of.\r\n\r\n12. Sixthly, If you take a Diaphanous Body, as for instance a Piece of\r\nGlass, and reduce it to Powder, the same Body, which when it was Entire,\r\nfreely Transmitted the Beams of Light, acquiring by Contusion a multitude\r\nof Minute Surfaces, each of which is as it were a Little, but Imperfect\r\n_Speculum_, is qualify'd to Reflect in a Confus'd manner, so many either\r\nBeams, or Little and Singly Unobservable Images of the Lucid Body, that\r\nfrom a Diaphanous it Degenerates into a White Body. And I remember, I have\r\nfor Trials sake taken Lumps of Rock Crystal, and Heating them Red hot in a\r\nCrucible, I found according to my Expectation, that being Quench'd in Fair\r\nwater, even those that remain'd in seemingly entire Lumps exchang'd their\r\nTranslucency for Whiteness, the Ignition and Extinction having as it were\r\nCrack'd each Lump into a multitude of Minute Bodies, and thereby given it a\r\ngreat multitude of new Surfaces. And ev'n with Diaphanous Bodies, that are\r\nColour'd, there may be this way a Greater Degree of Whiteness produced,\r\nthan one would lightly think; as I remember, I have by Contusion obtain'd\r\nWhitish Powders of _Granates_, Glass of _Antimony_, and _Emeralds_ finely\r\nBeaten, and you may more easily make the Experiment, by taking Good\r\nVenereal _Vitriol_ of a Deep Blew, and comparing with some of the Entire\r\nCrystalls purposely reserv'd, some of the Subtile Powder of the same Salt,\r\nwhich will Comparatively exhibit a very considerable degree of Whitishness.\r\n\r\n13. Seventhly, And as by a Change of Position in the Parts, a Body that is\r\nnot White, may be made White, so by a Slight change of the Texture of its\r\nSurface, a White Body may be Depriv'd of its Whiteness. For if, (as I have\r\ntry'd in Gold-smiths Shops) you take a piece of Silver that has been\r\nfreshly Boyl'd, as the Artificers call it, (which is done by, first\r\nBrushing, and then Decocting it with Salt and Tartar, and perhaps some\r\nother Ingredients) you shall find it to be of a Lovely White. But if you\r\ntake a piece of Smooth Steel, and therewith Burnish a part of it, which may\r\nbe presently done, you shall find that Part will Lose its Whiteness, and\r\nturn a _Speculum_, looking almost every where Dark, as other\r\nLooking-glasses do, which may not a little confirm our Doctrine. For by\r\nthis we may guess, what it is chiefly that made the Body White before, by\r\nconsidering that all that was done to deprive it of that Whiteness, was\r\nonly to Depress the Little Protuberances that were before on the Surface of\r\nthe Silver into one Continu'd Superficies, and thereby effect this, that\r\nnow the Image of the Lucid Body, and consequently a Kind of Whiteness shall\r\nappear to your Eye, but in some place of the greater Silver Looking-glass\r\n(whence the Beams reflected at an Angle Equal to that wherewith they fall\r\non it, may reach your Eye) whilst the Asperity remain'd Undestroy'd, the\r\nLight falling on innumerable Little _Specula_ Obverted some one way, and\r\nsome another, did from all Sensibly Distinguishable parts of the\r\nSuperficies reflect confus'd Beams or Representations of Light to the\r\nBeholders Eye, from whence soever he chance to Look upon it. And among the\r\nExperiments annex'd to this Discourse, you will find One, wherein by the\r\nChange of Texture in Bodies, Whiteness is in a Trice both Generated and\r\nDestroy'd.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n1. What we have Discours'd of Whiteness, may somewhat Assist us to form a\r\nNotion of Blackness, those two Qualities being Contrary enough to\r\nIllustrate each other. Yet among the Antient _Philosophers_ I find less\r\nAssistance to form a Notion of Blackness than of Whiteness, only\r\n_Democritus_ in the passage above Recited out of _Aristotle_ has given a\r\nGeneral Hint of the Cause of this Colour, by referring the Blackness of\r\nBodies to their Asperity. But this I call but a General Hint, because those\r\nBodies that are Green, and Purple, and Blew, seem to be so as well as Black\r\nones, upon the Account of their Superficial Asperity. But among the\r\n_Moderns_, the formerly mention'd _Gassendus_, perhaps invited by this Hint\r\nof _Democritus_, has Incidentally in another Epistle given us, though a\r\nvery Short, yet a somewhat Clearer account of the Nature of Blackness in\r\nthese words: _Existimare par est corpora suâpte Naturâ nigra constare ex\r\nparticulis, quarum Superficieculæ scabræ sint, nec facilè lucem extrorsum\r\nreflectant._ I wish this Ingenious Man had enlarg'd himself upon this\r\nSubject; For indeed it seems, that as that which makes a Body White, is\r\nchiefly such a Disposition of its Parts, that it Reflects (I mean without\r\nmuch Interruption) more of the Light that falls on it, than Bodies of any\r\nother Colour do, so that which makes a Body Black is principally a Peculiar\r\nkind of Texture, chiefly of its Superficial Particle, whereby it does as it\r\nwere Dead the Light that falls on it, so that very little is Reflected\r\nOutwards to the Eye.\r\n\r\n2. And this Texture may be Explicated two, and perhaps more than two\r\nseveral ways, whereof the first is by Supposing in the Superficies of the\r\nBlack Body a Particular kind of Asperity, whereby the Superficial Particles\r\nreflect but Few of the Incident Beams Outwards, and the rest Inwards\r\ntowards the Body it self. As if for Instance, we should conceive the\r\nSurface of a Black Body to be Asperated by an almost Numberless throng of\r\nLittle Cylinders, Pyramids, Cones, and other such Corpuscles, which by\r\ntheir being Thick Set and _Erected_, reflect the Beams of Light from one to\r\nanother Inwards, and send them too and fro so often, that at length they\r\nare Lost before they can come to Rebound out again to the Eye. And this is\r\nthe first of the two mention'd ways of Explicating Blackness. The other way\r\nis by Supposing the Texture of Black Bodies to be such, that either by\r\ntheir Yielding to the Beams of Light, or upon some other Account, they do\r\nas it were Dead the Beams of Light, and keep them from being Reflected in\r\nany Plenty, or with any Considerable Vigour of Motion, Outwards. According\r\nto this Notion it may be said, that the Corpuscles that make up the Beams\r\nof Light, whether they be Solary _Effluviums_, or Minute Particles of some\r\nÆtherial Substance, Thrusting on one another from the Lucid Body, do,\r\nfalling on Black Bodies, meet with such a Texture, that such Bodies receive\r\nInto themselves, and Retain almost all the Motion communicated to them by\r\nthe Corpuscles that make up the Beams of Light, and consequently Reflect\r\nbut Few of them, or those but Languidly, towards the Eye, it happening here\r\nalmost in like manner as to a ball, which thrown against a Stone or Floor,\r\nwould Rebound a great way Upwards, but Rebounds very Little or not at all,\r\nwhen it is thrown against Water, or Mud, or a Loose Net, because the Parts\r\nyield, and receive into themselves the Motion, on whose Account the Ball\r\nshould be Reflected Outwards. But this Last way of Explicating Blackness, I\r\nshall content my Self to have Propos'd, without either Adopting it, or\r\nabsolutely Rejecting it. For the Hardness of Touchstones, Black Marble and\r\nother Bodies, that being Black are Solid, seem to make it somewhat\r\nImprobable, that such Bodies should be of so Yielding a Texture, unless we\r\nshould say, that some Bodies may be more Dispos'd to Yield to the Impulses\r\nof the Corpuscles of Light by reason of a Peculiar Texture, than other\r\nBodies, that in other Tryals appear to be Softer than they. But though the\r\nFormer of these two Explications of Blackness be that, by which we shall\r\nEndeavour to give an Account of it, yet as we said, we shall not Absolutely\r\nReject this Latter, partly because they both Agree in this, that Black\r\nBodies Reflect but Little of the Light that falls on them, and partly\r\nbecause it is not Impossible, that in some Cases both the Disposition of\r\nthe Superficial particles, as to Figure and Position, and the Yielding of\r\nthe Body, or some of its Parts, may joyntly, though not in an Equal measure\r\nconcurr to the rendring of a Body Black. The Considerations that induc'd me\r\nto propose this Notion of Blackness, as I Explan'd it, are principally\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n3. First, That as I lately said, Whiteness and Blackness being generally\r\nreputed to be Contrary Qualities, Whiteness depending as I said upon the\r\nDisposition of the Parts of a Body to Reflect much Light, it seems likely,\r\nthat Blackness may depend upon a Contrary Disposition of the Black Bodies\r\nSurface; But upon this I shall not Insist.\r\n\r\n4. Next then we see, that if a Body of One and the same Colour be plac'd,\r\npart in the Sun-beams, and part in the Shade, that part which is not Shin'd\r\non will appear more of Kin to Blackness than the other, from which more\r\nLight Rebounds to the Eye; And Dark Colours seem the Blacker, the less\r\nLight they are Look'd upon in, and we think all Things Black in the Dark,\r\nwhen they send no Beams to make Impressions on our Organs of Sight, so that\r\nShadows and Darkness are near of Kin, and Shaddow we know is but a\r\nPrivation of Light; and accordingly Blackness seems to proceed from the\r\nPaucity of Beams Reflected from the Black Body to the Eye, I say the\r\nPaucity of Beams, because those Bodies that we call Black, as Marble, Jeat,\r\n&c. are Short of being perfectly so, else we should not See them at all.\r\nBut though the Beams that fall on the Sides of those Erected Particles that\r\nwe have been mentioning, do Few of them return Outwards, yet those that\r\nfall upon the Points of those Cylinders, Cones, or Pyramids, may thence\r\nRebound to the Eye, though they make there but a Faint Impression, because\r\nthey Arrive not there, but Mingl'd with a great Proportion of Little\r\nShades. This may be Confirm'd by my having procur'd a Large piece of Black\r\nMarble well Polish'd, and brought to the Form of a Large Sphærical and\r\nConcave _Speculum_; For on the Inside this Marble being well Polish'd, was\r\na kind of Dark Looking-glass, wherein I could plainly see a Little Image of\r\nthe Sun, when that Shin'd upon it. But this Image was very far from\r\nOffending and Dazling my Eyes, as it would have done from another\r\n_Speculum_; Nor, though the _Speculum_ were Large, could I in a Long time,\r\nor in a Hot Sun set a piece of Wood on Fire, though a far less _Speculum_\r\nof the same Form, and of a more Reflecting Matter, would have made it Flame\r\nin a Trice.\r\n\r\n5. And on this Occasion we may as well in Reference to something formerly\r\ndeliver'd concerning Whiteness, as in Reference to what has been newly\r\nsaid, Subjoyn what we further observ'd touching the Differing Reflections\r\nof Light from White and Black Marble, namely, that having taking a pretty\r\nLarge Mortar of White Marble, New and Polish'd in the Inside, and Expos'd\r\nit to the Sun, we found that it Reflected a great deal of Glaring Light,\r\nbut so Dispers'd, that we could not make the Reflected Beams concurr in any\r\nsuch Conspicuous _Focus_, as that newly taken notice of in the Black\r\nMarble, though perhaps there may enough of them be made to meet near the\r\nBottom, to make some Kind of _Focus_, especially since by holding in the\r\nNight-time a Candle at a convenient Distance, we were able to procure a\r\nConcourse of some, though not many of the Reflected Beams, at about two\r\nInches distant from the Bottom of the Mortar: But we found the Heat even of\r\nthe Sunbeams so Dispersedly Reflected to be very Languid, even in\r\nComparison of the Black Marbles _Focus_. And the Little Picture of the Sun,\r\nthat appear'd upon the White Marble as a _Speculum_, was but very Faint and\r\nexceeding ill Defin'd. Secondly, That taking two pieces of Plain and\r\nPolish'd Surfaces, and casting on them Successively the Beams of the Same\r\nCandle, In such manner, as that the Neighbouring Superficies being Shaded\r\nby an Opacous and Perforated Body, the Incident Beams were permitted to\r\npass but through a Round Hole of about Half an Inch Diameter, the Circle of\r\nLight that appear'd on the White Marble was in Comparison very Bright, but\r\nvery ill Defin'd; whereas that on the Black Marble was far less Luminous,\r\nbut much more precisely Defin'd.\r\n\r\n6. Thirdly, When you Look upon a piece of Linnen that has Small Holes in\r\nit, those Holes appear very Black, and Men are often deceiv'd in taking\r\nHoles for Spots of Ink; And Painters to represent Holes, make use of Black,\r\nthe Reason of which seems to be, that the Beams that fall on those Holes,\r\nfall into them So Deep, that none of them is Reflected back to the Eye. And\r\nin narrow Wells part of the Mouth seems Black, because the Incident Beams\r\nare Reflected Downwards from one side to another, till they can no more\r\nRebound to the Eye.\r\n\r\nWe may consider too, that if Differing parts of the same piece of Black\r\nVelvet be stroak'd Opposite ways, the piece of Velvet will appear of two\r\nDistinct kinds of Blackness, the one far Darker than the other, of which\r\nDisparity the Reason Seems to be, that in the Less obscure part of the\r\nVelvet, the Little Silken Piles whereof 'tis made up, being Inclin'd, there\r\nis a Greater part of each of them Obverted to the Eye, whereas in the other\r\npart the Piles of Silk being more Erected, there are far Fewer Beams\r\nReflected Outwards from the Lateral parts of each Pile, So that most of\r\nthose that Rebound to the Eye, come from the Tops of the Piles, which make\r\nbut a small part of the whole Superficies, that may be cover'd by the piece\r\nof Velvet. Which Explication I propose, not that I think the Blackness of\r\nthe Velvet proceeds from the Cause assign'd, since each Single Pile of Silk\r\nis Black by reason of its Texture, in what Position soever you Look upon\r\nit; But that the Greater Blackness of one of these Tuffts seems to proceed\r\nfrom the Greater Paucity of Beams Reflected from it, and that from the\r\nFewness of those Parts of a Surface that Reflect Beams, and the Multitude\r\nof those Shaded Parts that Reflect none. And I remember, that I have\r\noftentimes observ'd, that the Position of Particular Bodies far greater\r\nthan Piles of Silk in reference to the Eye, may notwithstanding their\r\nhaving each of them a Colour of its own, make one part of their Aggregate\r\nappear far Darker than the other; For I have near Great Towns often taken\r\nnotice, that a Cart-load of Carrots pack'd up, appear'd of a much Darker\r\nColour when Look'd upon, where the Points of the Carrots were Obverted to\r\nthe Eye, than where the Sides of them were so.\r\n\r\n7. Fourthly, In a Darkned Room, I purposely observ'd, that if the\r\nSun-beams, which came in at the Hole were receiv'd upon White or any other\r\nColour, and directed to a Convenient place of the Room, they would\r\nManifestly, though not all Equally, Encrease the Light of that Part;\r\nwhereas if we Substituted, either a piece of Black Cloth or Black Velvet,\r\nit would so Dead the Incident Beams, that the place (newly mention'd)\r\nwhereto I Obverted the Black Body, would be Less Enlightned than it was\r\nbefore, when it received its Light but from the Weak and Oblique\r\nReflections of the Floor and Walls of a pretty Large Room, through which\r\nthe Beams that came in at the Hole were Confusedly and Brokenly Dispers'd.\r\n\r\n8. Fifthly, And to shew that the Beams that fall on Black Bodies, as they\r\ndo not Rebound Outwards to the Eye, so they are Reflected towards the Body\r\nit self, as the Nature of those Erected Particles to which we have imputed\r\nBlackness, requires, we will add an Experiment that will also confirm our\r\nDoctrine touching Whiteness; Namely, that we took a Broad and Large Tile,\r\nand having Whitened over one half of the Superficies of it, and Black'd the\r\nother, we expos'd it to the Summer Sun; And having let it lye there a\r\nconvenient time (for the Difference is more Apparent, if it have not lain\r\nthere too long) we found, as we expected, that whilst the Whited part of\r\nthe Tile remained Cool enough, the Black'd part of the same Tile was grown\r\nnot only Sensible, but very Hot, (sometimes to a strong Degree.) And to\r\nsatisfie some of our Friends the more, we have sometimes left upon the\r\nSurface of the Tile, besides the White and Black parts thereof, a part that\r\nRetain'd the native Red of the Tile it self, and Exposing them to the Sun,\r\nwe observ'd this Last mention'd to have Contracted a Heat in comparison of\r\nthe White, but a Heat Inferiour to that of the Black, of which the Reason\r\nseems to be, that the Superficial Particles of Black Bodies, being, as we\r\nsaid, more Erected, than those of White or Red ones, the Corpuscles of\r\nLight falling on their sides, being for the most part Reflected Inwards\r\nfrom one Particle to another, and thereby engag'd as it were and kept from\r\nRebounding Upwards, they communicate their brisk Motion, wherewith they\r\nwere impell'd against the Black Body, (upon whose account had they fallen\r\nupon a White Body, they would have been Reflected Outwards) to the Small\r\nparts of the Black Body, and thereby Produce in those Small parts such an\r\nAgitation, as (when we feel it) we are wont to call Heat. I have been\r\nlately inform'd, that an Observation near of Kin to Ours, has been made by\r\nsome Learned Men in _France_ and _Italy_, by long Exposing to a very Hot\r\nSun, two pieces of Marble, the one White, the other Black; But though the\r\nObservation be worthy of them, and may confirm the same Truth with Our\r\nExperiment, yet besides that our Tryal needs not the Summer, nor any Great\r\nHeat to succeed, It seems to have this Advantage above the other, that\r\nwhereas Bodies more Solid, and of a Closer Texture, though they use to be\r\nmore Slowly Heated, are wont to receive a Greater Degree of Heat from the\r\nSun or Fire, than (_Cæteris paribus_) Bodies of a Slightest Texture; I have\r\nfound by the Information of Stone-cutters, and by other ways of Enquiry,\r\nthat Black Marble is much Solider and Harder than White, so that possibly\r\nthe Difference betwixt the Degrees of Heat they receive from the Sunbeams\r\nwill by many be ascrib'd to the Difference of their Texture, rather than to\r\nthat of their Colour, though I think our Experiment will make it Probable\r\nenough that the greater part of that Difference may well be ascrib'd to\r\nthat Disposition of Parts, which makes the one Reflect the Sunbeams Inward;\r\nand the other Outwards. And with this Doctrine accords very well, that\r\nRooms hung with Black, are not only Darker than else they would be, but are\r\nwont to be Warmer too; Insomuch that I have known a great Lady, whose\r\nConstitution was somewhat Tender, complain that she was wont to catch Cold,\r\nwhen she went out into the Air, after having made any long Visits to\r\nPersons, whose Rooms were hung with Black. And this is not the only Lady I\r\nhave heard complain of the Warmth of such Rooms, which though perhaps it\r\nmay be partly imputed to the _Effluvia_ of those Materials wherewith the\r\nhangings were Dy'd, yet probably the Warmth of such Rooms depends chiefly\r\nupon the same Cause that the Darkness does; As (not to repeat what I\r\nformerly Noted touching my Gloves,) to satisfie some Curious Persons of\r\nthat Sex, I have convinc'd them, by Tryall, that of two Pieces of Silken\r\nStuff given me by themselves, and expos'd in their Presence, to the same\r\nWindow, Shin'd on by that Sun, the White was _considerably_ Heated, when\r\nthe Black was not so much as _Sensibly_ so.\r\n\r\n9. Sixthly, I remember, that Acquainting one Day a _Virtuoso_ of\r\nUnsuspected Credit, that had Visited Hot Countries, with part of what I\r\nhave here Deliver'd concerning Blackness, he Related to me by way of\r\nConfirmation of it, a very notable Experiment, which he had both others\r\nmake, and Made himself in a Warm Climate, namely, that having carefully\r\nBlack'd over Eggs, and Expos'd them to the Hot Sun, they were thereby in no\r\nvery Long time well Roasted, to which Effect I conceive the Heat of the\r\nClimate must have Concurr'd with the Disposition of the Black Surface to\r\nReflect the Sunbeams Inward, for I remember, that having made that among\r\nother Tryals in _England_, though in Summer-time, the Eggs I Expos'd,\r\nacquir'd indeed a considerable Degree of Heat, but yet not so Intense a\r\nOne, as prov'd Sufficient to Roast them.\r\n\r\n10. Seventhly, and Lastly, Our Conjectures at the Nature of Blackness may\r\nbe somewhat Confirm'd by the (formerly mention'd) Observation of the Blind\r\n_Dutch-man_, that Discerns Colours with his Fingers; for he Says, that he\r\nFeels a greater Roughness upon the Surfaces of Black Bodies, than upon\r\nthose of Red, or Yellow, or Green. And I remember, that the Diligent\r\n_Bartholinus_ says,[9] that a Blind Earl of _Mansfield_ could Distinguish\r\nWhite from Black only by the Touch, which would Sufficiently Argue a great\r\nDisparity in the Asperities, or other Superficial Textures of Bodies of\r\nthose two Colours, if the Learn'd Relator had Affirm'd the Matter upon his\r\nown Knowledge.\r\n\r\n  [9] Hist. Anatom. Cent. 3. Hist. 44.\r\n\r\nII. These, _Pyrophilus_, are the chief things that Occurr to me at present,\r\nabout the Nature of Whiteness and Blackness, which it they have Rendred it\r\nso much as Probable, that in _Most_; or at least _Many_ Cases, the Causes\r\nof these Qualities may be such as I have Adventur'd to Deliver, it is as\r\nmuch as I Pretend to; for till I have Opportunity to Examine the Matter by\r\nsome further Tryals, I am not sure, but that in some White and Black\r\nBodies, there may Concurr to the Colour some peculiar Texture or\r\nDisposition of the Body, whereby the Motion of the Small Corpuscles that\r\nmake up the Incident Beams of Light, may be Differingly Modify'd, before\r\nthey reach the Eye, especially in this, that White Bodies do not only\r\nCopiously Reflect those Incident Corpuscles Outwards, but Reflect them\r\nBriskly, and do not otherwise Alter them in the manner of their Motion. Nor\r\nshall I now stay to Enquire, whether some of those other ways, (as a\r\nDisposition to Alter the Velocity, the Rotation, or the Order and Manner of\r\nAppulse so the Eye of the Reflected Corpuscles that Compos'd the Incident\r\nBeams of Light) which we mention'd when we consider'd the Production of\r\nColours in General, may not in some Cases be Applicable to those of White\r\nand Black Bodies: For I am yet so much a _Seeker_ in this Matter, and so\r\nlittle Wedded to the Opinions I have propos'd, that what I am to add shall\r\nbe but the Beginning of a Collection of Experiments and Observation towards\r\nthe History of Whiteness and Blackness, without at present interposing my\r\nExplications of them, that so, I may assist your Enquires without much\r\nFore-stalling or Biassing your Judgment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                   EXPERIMENT\r\n                       IN\r\n                    CONSORT,\r\n                    Touching\r\n              Whiteness & Blackness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT I.\r\n\r\nHaving promis'd in the 114, and 115. Pages of the foregoing Discourse of\r\nWhiteness and Blackness, to shew, that those two Colours may by a change of\r\nTexture in bodies, each of them apart Diaphanous and Colourless, be at\r\npleasure and in a trice as well Generated as Destroy'd, We shall begin with\r\nExperiments that may acquit us of that promise.\r\n\r\nTake then what Quantity you please of Fair Water, and having Heated it, put\r\ninto it as much good Common Sublimate, as it is able to Dissolve, and (to\r\nbe sure of having it well glutted:) continue putting in the Sublimate, till\r\nsome of it lye Untouch'd in the bottom of the Liquor, Filter this Solution\r\nthrough Cap-paper, to have it cleer and limpid, and into a spoonfull or two\r\nthereof, (put into a clean glass vessel,) shake about four or five drops\r\n(according as you took more or less of this Solution) of good limpid\r\nSpirits of Urine, and immediately the whole mixture will appear White like\r\nMilk, to which mixture if you presently add a convenient proportion of\r\nRectifi'd _Aqua Fortis_ (for the number of drops is hard to determine,\r\nbecause of the Differing Strength of the liquor, but easily found by tryal)\r\nthe Whiteness will presently disappear, and the whole mixture become\r\nTransparent, which you may, if you please, again reduce to a good degree of\r\nWhiteness (though inferiour to the first) onely by a more copious affusion\r\nof fresh Spirit of Urine. _N_. First, That it is not so necessary to employ\r\neither _Aqua Fortis_ or Spirit of Urine about this Experiment, but that we\r\nhave made it with other liquors instead of these, of which perhaps more\r\nelsewhere. Secondly, That this Experiment, though not made with the same\r\n_Menstruums_, nor producing the same Colour is yet much of Kin to that\r\nother to be mentioned in this Tract among our other Experiments of Colours,\r\nabout turning a Solution of Præcipitate into an Orange-colour, and the\r\nChymical Reason being much alike in both, the annexing it to one of them\r\nmay suffice FOR both.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT II._\r\n\r\nMake a strong Infusion of broken Galls in Fair Water, and having Filtred it\r\ninto a clean Vial, add more of the same liquor to it, till you have made it\r\nsomewhat Transparent, and sufficiently diluted the Colour, for the credit\r\nof the Experiment, lest otherwise the Darkness of the liquor might make it\r\nbe objected, that 'twas already almost Ink; Into this Infusion shake a\r\nconvenient quantity of a Cleer, but very strong Solution of Vitriol, and\r\nyou shall immediately see the mixture turn Black almost like Ink, and such\r\na way of producing Blackness is vulgar enough; but if presently after you\r\ndoe upon this mixture drop a small quantity of good oyl of Vitriol, and, by\r\nshaking the Vial disperse it nimbly through the two other liquors, you\r\nshall (if you perform your part well, and have employ'd oyl of Vitriol\r\nCleer and Strong enough) see the Darkness of the liquor presently begin to\r\nbe discuss'd, and grow pretty Cleer and Transparent, losing its Inky\r\nBlackness, which you may again restore to it by the affusion of a small\r\nquantity of a very strong Solution of Salt of Tartar. And though neither of\r\nthese Atramentous liquors will seem other than very Pale Ink, if you write\r\nwith a clean Pen dipt in them, yet that is common to them with some sorts\r\nof Ink that prove very good when Dry, as I have also found, that when I\r\nmade these carefully, what I wrote with either of them, especially with the\r\nFormer, would when throughly Dry grow Black enough not to appear bad Ink.\r\nThis Experiment of taking away and restoring Blackness from and to the\r\nliquors, we have likewise tryed in Common Ink; but there it succeeds not so\r\nwell, and but very slowly, by reason that the Gum wont to be employed in\r\nthe making it, does by its Tenacity oppose the operations of the above\r\nmention'd Saline liquors. But to consider Gum no more, what some kind of\r\nPræcipitation may have to do in the producing and destroying of Inks\r\nwithout it, I have elsewhere given you some occasion and assistance to\r\nenquire; But I must not now stay to do so my self, only I shall take notice\r\nto you, that though it be taken for granted that bodies will not be\r\nPræcipitated by Alcalizat Salts, that have not first been dissolved in some\r\nAcid _Menstruums_, yet I have found upon tryals, which my conjectures lead\r\nme to make on purpose, That divers Vegetables _barely infus'd_, or, _but\r\nslightly decocted in common water_, would, upon the affusion of a Strong\r\nand Cleer _Lixivium_ of Potashes, and much more of some other Præcipitating\r\nliquors that I sometimes employ, afford good store of a Crudled matter,\r\nsuch as I have had in the Præcipitations of Vegetable substances, by the\r\nintervention of Acid things, and that this matter was easily separable from\r\nthe rest of the liquor, being left behind by it in the Filtre; and in\r\nmaking the first Ink mention'd in this Experiment, I found that I could by\r\nFiltration separate pretty store of a very Black pulverable substance, that\r\nremain'd in the Filtre, and when the Ink was made Cleer again by the Oyl of\r\nVitriol, the affusion of dissolv'd _Sal Tartari_ seem'd but to Præcipitate,\r\nand thereby to Unite and render Conspicuous the particles of the Black\r\nmixture that had before been dispers'd into very Minute and singly\r\nInvisible particles by the Incisive and resolving power of the highly\r\nCorrosive Oyl of Vitriol.\r\n\r\nAnd to manifest, _Pyrophilus_, that Galls are not so requisite as many\r\nsuppose to the making Atramentous Liquors, we have sometimes made the\r\nfollowing Experiment, We took dryed Rose leaves and Decocted them for a\r\nwhile in Fair Water, into two or three spoonfulls of this Decoction we\r\nshook a few drops of a strong and well filtrated Solution of Vitriol (which\r\nperhaps had it been Green would have done as well) and immediately the\r\nmixture did turn Black, and when into this mixture presently after it was\r\nmade, we shook a just Proportion of _Aqua Fortis_, we turn'd it from a\r\nBlack Ink to a deep Red one, which by the affusion of a little Spirit of\r\nUrine may be reduc'd immediately to an Opacous and Blackish Colour. And in\r\nregard, _Pyrophilus_, that in the former Experiments, both the Infusion of\r\nGalls, and the Decoction of Roses, and the Solution of Copperis employ'd\r\nabout them, are endow'd each of them with its own Colour, there may be a\r\nmore noble Experiment of the sudden production of Blackness made by the\r\nway mention'd in the Second Section of the Second Part of our Essays, for\r\nthough upon the Confusion of the two Liquors there mention'd, there do\r\nimmediately emerge a very Black mixture, yet both the Infusion of\r\n_Orpiment_ and the Solution of _Minium_ were before their being joyn'd\r\ntogether, Limpid and Colourless.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT III._\r\n\r\nIf pieces of White Harts-horn be with a competent degree of Fire distill'd\r\nin a Glass-retort, they will, after the avolation of the Flegm, Spirit,\r\nVolatile Salt, and the looser and lighter parts of the Oleagenous\r\nsubstance, remain behind of a Cole-black colour. And even Ivory it self\r\nbeing skilfully Burnt (how I am wont to do it, I have elsewhere set down)\r\naffords Painters one of the best and deepest Blacks they have, and yet in\r\nthe Instance of distill'd Harts-horn, the operation being made in\r\nGlass-vessels carefully clos'd, it appears there is no Extraneous Black\r\nsubstance that Insinuates it self into White Harts-horn, and thereby makes\r\nit turn Black; but that the Whiteness is destroy'd, and the Blackness\r\ngenerated, only by a Change of Texture, made in the burnt Body, by the\r\nRecess of some parts and the Transposition of others. And though I remember\r\nnot that in many Distillations of Harts-horn I ever sound the _Cap. Mort_.\r\nto pass from Black to a true Whiteness, whilst it continu'd in Clos'd\r\nvessels, yet having taken out the Cole-black fragments, and Calcin'd them\r\nin Open vessels, I could in few hours quite destroy that Blackness, &\r\nwithout sensibly changing their Bulk or Figure, reduce them to great\r\nWhiteness. So much do these two Colours depend upon the Disposition of the\r\nlittle parts, that the Bodies wherein they are to be met with do consist\r\nof. And we find, that if Whitewine Tartar, or even the white Crystalls of\r\nsuch Tartar be burnt without being truly Calcin'd, the _Cap. Mortuum_ (as\r\nthe Chymists call the more Fixt part) will be Black. But if you further\r\ncontinue the Calcination till you have perfectly Incinerated the Tartar, &\r\nkept it long enough in a Strong fire, the remaining _Calx_ will be White.\r\nAnd so we see that not only other Vegetable substances, but even White\r\nwoods, as the Hazel, will yield a Black Charcoal, and afterwards Whitish\r\nashes; And so Animal substances naturally White, as Bones and Eggshels,\r\nwill grow Black upon the being Burnt, and White again when they are\r\nperfectly Calcin'd.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT IV._\r\n\r\nBut yet I much Question whether that Rule delivered by divers, as well\r\nPhilosophers as Chymists, _adusta nigra, sed perusta alba_, will hold as\r\nUniversally as is presum'd, since I have several Examples to allege against\r\nit: For I have found that by burning Alablaster, so as both to make it\r\nappear to boyl almost like Milk, and to reduce it to a very fine Powder, it\r\nwould not at all grow Black, but retain its Pure and Native Whiteness, and\r\nthough by keeping it longer than is usual in the fire, I produced but a\r\nfaint Yellow, even in that part of the Powder that lay nearest the top of\r\nthe Crucible, yet having purposely enquired of an Experienced Stone-cutter,\r\nwho is Curious enough in tryng Conclusions in his own Trade, he told me he\r\nhad found that if Alabaster or Plaster of Paris be very long kept in a\r\nStrong fire, the whole heap of burnt Powder would exchange its Whiteness\r\nfor a much deeper Colour than the Yellow I observ'd. Lead being Calcin'd\r\nwith a Strong fire turns (after having purhaps run thorough divers other\r\nColour) into _Minium_, whose Colour we know is a deep red; and if you urge\r\nthis _Minium_, as I have purposely done with a Strong fire, you may much\r\neasier find a Glassie and Brittle Body darker than _Minium_, than any white\r\n_Calx_ or Glass. 'Tis known among Chymists, that the white _Calx_ of\r\nAntimony, by the further and more vehement operation of the fire, may be\r\nmelted into Glass, which we have obtain'd of a Red Colour, which is far\r\ndeeper than that of the _Calx_ of Burnt Antimony, and though common Glafs\r\nof Antimony being usually Adulterated with _Borax_, have its Colour thereby\r\ndiluted, oftentimes to a very pale Yellow; yet not onely ours made more\r\nsincerily, was, as we said, of a Colour less remote from Black, than was\r\nthe _Calx_; but we observ'd, that by Melting it once or twice more, and so\r\nexposing it to the further operation of the Fire, we had, as we expected,\r\nthe Colour heightned. To which we shall add but this one Instance, (which\r\nis worth the taking notice of in Reference to Colours:) That, if you take\r\nBlew, but Unsophisticated, Vitriol, and burn it very slowly, and with a\r\nGentle degree of Heat, you may observe, that when it has Burnt but a\r\nLittle, and yet so far as that you may rub it to Powder betwixt your\r\nfingers, it will be of a White or Whitish Colour; But if you Prosecute the\r\nCalcination, this Body which by a light Adustion was made White, will pass\r\nthrough other Colours, as Gray, Yellowish, and Red; and if you further burn\r\nit with a Long and Vehement fire, by that time it comes to be _Perustum_,\r\nit will be of a dark purple, nearer to Black, not only than the first\r\n_Calx_, but than the Vitriol before it at all felt the fire. I might add\r\nthat _Crocus_ _Martis_ (_per se_ as they call it) made by the Lasting\r\nviolence of the Reverberated flames is not so near a Kin to White, as the\r\nIron or Steel that afforded it was before its Calcinations; but that I\r\nsuppose, these Instances may Suffice to satisfie you, that Minerals are to\r\nbe excepted out of the forementioned Rule, which perhaps, though it seldome\r\nfail in substances belonging to the Vegetable or Animal Kingdome, may yet\r\nbe Question'd even in some of these, if that be true, which the Judicious\r\nTraveller _Bellonius_ affirms, that Charcoales made out of the Wood of\r\n_Oxycæder_ are White; And I could not find that though in Retorts Hartshorn\r\nand other White Bodies will be Denigrated by Heat, yet Camphire would not\r\nat all lose its Whiteness, though I have purposely kept it in such a heat,\r\nas made it melt and boyl.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT V._\r\n\r\nAnd now I speak of Camphire, it puts me in mind of adding this Experiment,\r\nThat, though as I said in Clos'd Glasses, I could not Denigrate it by Heat,\r\nbut it would Sublime to the sides and top of the Glass, as it was before,\r\nyet not only it will, being set on fire in the Free Air, send forth a\r\nCopious smoak, but having purposely upon some of it that was Flaming, clapt\r\na Large Glass, almost in the form of a Hive, (but more Slender only) with a\r\nHole at the top, (which I caus'd to be made to trye Experiments of Fire and\r\nFlame in) it continued so long burning that it Lin'd all the Inside of the\r\nGlass with a Soot as Black as Ink, and so Copious, that the Closeness of\r\nthe Vessel consider'd, almost all that part of the White Camphire that did\r\ntake Fire, seem'd to have been chang'd into that deep Black Substance.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT VI_\r\n\r\nAnd this also brings into my mind another Experiment that I made about the\r\nproduction of Blackness, whereof, for Reasons too long to be here deduced,\r\nI expected and found a good Success, an it was this: I took Rectifi'd Oyl\r\nof Vitriol (that I might have the Liquor Clean as well as Strong) and by\r\ndegrees mixt with it a convenient proportion of the Essential Oyl, as\r\nChymists call it, of Wormwood, drawn over with store of Water in a Limbec,\r\nand warily Distilling the mixture in a Retort, there remain'd a scarce\r\ncredible quantity of dry Matter, Black as a Coal. And because the Oyl of\r\nWormwood, though a Chymical Oyl drawn by a _Virtuoso_, seem'd to have\r\nsomewhat in it of the Colour of the Plant, I Substituted in its Room, the\r\nPure and Subtile Essential Oyl of Winter-Savory, and mixing little by\r\nlittle this Liquor, with (if I mis-remember not) an Equal weight of the\r\nformerly mention'd Rectifi'd Oyl of Vitriol, and Distilling them as before\r\nin a Retort, besides what there pass'd over into the Receiver, even these\r\ntwo clear Liquors left me a Considerable Proportion, (though not so great\r\nas the two former) of a Substance Black as Pitch, which I yet Keep by me\r\nas a Rarity.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT VII._\r\n\r\nA way of Whiting Wax Cheaply and in Great Quantity may be a thing of good\r\nOeconomical Use, and we have elsewhere set down the Practice of Trades-men\r\nthat Blanch it; But here Treating of Whiteness only in Order to the\r\nPhilosophy of Colours, I shall not Examine which of the Slow wayes may be\r\nbest Employ'd, to free Wax from the Yellow Melleous parts, but shall rather\r\nset down a Quick way of making it White, though but in very Small\r\nQuantities. Take then a little Yellow Wax, scraped or thinly sliced, and\r\nputting it into a Bolts-head or some other Convenient Glass, pour to it a\r\npretty deal of Spirit of Wine, and placing the Vessel in Warm Sand,\r\nEncrease the Heat by degrees, till the Spirit of Wine begin to Simper or to\r\nBoyl a little; and continuing that degree of Fire, if you have put Liquor\r\nenough, you will quickly have the Wax dissolv'd, then taking it off the\r\nfire, you may either suffer it to Cool as hastily as with Safety to the\r\nGlass you can, or Pour it whilst 'tis yet Hot into a Filtre of Paper, and\r\neither in the Glass where it Cools, or in the Filtre, you will soon find\r\nthe Wax and _Menstruum_ together reduc'd into a White Substance, almost\r\nlike Butter, which by letting the Spirit Exhale will shrink into a much\r\nLesser Bulk, but still retaining its Whiteness. And that which is pretty in\r\nthe working of this Magistery of Wax, is, that the Yellowness vanishes,\r\nneither appearing in the Spirit of Wine that passes Limpid through the\r\nFiltre, nor in the Butter of Wax, if I may so call it, that, as I said, is\r\nWhite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT VIII._\r\n\r\nThere is an Experiment, _Pyrophilus_, which though I do not so exactly\r\nremember, and though it be somewhat Nice to make, yet I am willing to\r\nAcquaint You with, because the thing Produc'd, though it be but a\r\nCuriosity, is wont not a little to please the Beholders, and it is a way of\r\nturning by the help of a Dry Substance, an almost Golden-Colour'd Concrete,\r\ninto a White one, the Several Tryals are not at present so fresh in my\r\nMemory to enable me to tell you Certainly, whether an Equal onely or a\r\nDouble weight of Common Sublimate must be taken in reference to the\r\nTinglass, but if I mistake not, there was in the Experiment that succeeded\r\nbest, Two parts of the Former taken to One of the Latter. These Ingredients\r\nbeing finely Powdred and Exactly mix'd, we Sublim'd together by degrees of\r\nfire (the due Gradation of which is in this Experiment a thing of main\r\nImportance) there ascended a matter of a very peculiar Texture, for it was\r\nfor the most part made up of very Thin, Smooth, Soft and Slippery Plates,\r\nalmost like the finest sort of the Scales of Fishes, but of so Lovely a\r\nWhite Inclining to Pearl-Colour, and of so Curious and Shining a Gloss,\r\nthat they appear'd in some respect little Inferiour to Orient Pearls, and\r\nin other Regards, they seem'd to Surpass them, and were Applauded for a\r\nsort of the Prettiest Trifles that we had ever prepar'd to Amuse the Eye. I\r\nwill not undertake that though you'l hardly miss changing the Colour of\r\nyour shining Tinglass, yet you will the first or perhaps the second time\r\nhit Right upon the way of making the Glistring Sublimate I have been\r\nmentioning.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT IX._\r\n\r\nWhen we Dissolve in _Aqua Fortis_ a mixture of Gold and Silver melted into\r\none Lump, it usually happens that the Powder of Gold that falls to the\r\nbottom, as not being Dissoluble by that _Menstruum_, will not have its own\r\nYellow, but appear of a Black Colour, though neither the Gold, nor the\r\nSilver, nor the _Aqua Fortis_ did before manifest any Blackness. And divers\r\nAlchymists, when they make Solutions of Minerals they would Examine, are\r\nvery Glad, if they see a Black Powder Præcipitated to the Bottom, taking it\r\nfor a Hopefull Sign, that those Particles are of a Golden Nature, which\r\nappear in a Colour so ordinary to Gold parted from other Metalls by _Aqua\r\nFortis_, that it is a trouble to the Refiner to Reduce the Præcipitated\r\n_Calx_ to its Native Colour. For though, (as we have try'd,) that may be\r\nQuickly enough done by Fire, which will make this Gold look very Gloriously\r\n(as indeed 'tis at least one of the Best wayes that is Practis'd for the\r\nRefining of Gold,) yet it requires both Watchfulness and Skill, to give it\r\nsuch a Degree of Fire as will serve to Restore it to its Lustre, without\r\ngiving it such a One, as may bring it to Fusion, to which the Minuteness of\r\nthe _Corpuseles_ it consists of makes the Powder very apt. And this brings\r\ninto my Mind, that having taken a Flat and Bright piece of Gold, that was\r\nRefin'd by a Curious and Skilfull Person on purpose to Trye to what height\r\nof Purity Gold could be brought by Art, I found that this very piece, as\r\nGlorious as it look'd, being rubb'd a little upon a piece of fine clean\r\nLinnen, did sully it with a kind of Black; and the like I have observ'd in\r\nRefin'd Silver, which I therefore mention, because I formerly suspected\r\nthat the Impurity of the Metall might have been the only Cause of what I\r\nhave divers times obferv'd in wearing Silver-hilted Swords, Namely, that\r\nwhere they rubb'd upon my Clothes, if they were of a Light-Colour'd Cloath,\r\nthe Affriction would quickly Black them; and Congruously hereunto I have\r\nfound Pens Blackt almost all over, when I had a while carri'd them about me\r\nin a Silver Ink-case. To which I shall only add, that whereas in these\r\nseveral Instances of Denigration, the Metalls are worn off, or otherwise\r\nReduc'd into very Minute Parts, that Circumstance may prove not Unworthy\r\nyour Notice.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT X._\r\n\r\nThat a Solution of Silver does Dye Hair of a Black Colour, is a Known\r\nExperiment, which some persons more Curious than Dextrous, have so\r\nUnluckily made upon themselves as to make their Friends very Merry. And I\r\nremember that the other day, I made my self some Sport by an Improvement of\r\nthis Observation, for having dissolv'd some Pure Silver in _Aqua Fortis_,\r\nand Evaporated the _Menstruum ad siccitatem_, as they speak, I caus'd a\r\nQuantity of fair Water to be pour'd upon the _Calx_ two or three several\r\ntimes, and to be at each Evaporated, till the _Calx_ was very Drye, and all\r\nthe Greenish Blewness that is wont to appear in Common Crystals of Silver,\r\nwas quite carry'd away. Then I made those I meant to Deceive, Moisten some\r\npart of their Skin with their own Spittle, and slightly Rub the moistned\r\nparts with a little of this Prepar'd Silver, Whereupon they Admir'd to see,\r\nthat a Snow-white Body laid upon the White Skin should presently produce a\r\ndeep Blackness, as if the stains had been made with Ink, especially\r\nconsidering that this Blackness could not, like that produc'd by ordinary\r\nInk, be readily Wash'd off, but requir'd many Hours, and part of it some\r\ndayes to its Obliteration. And with the same White _Calx_ and a little Fair\r\nWater we likewise Stain'd the White Hafts of Knives, with a lasting Black\r\nin those parts where the _Calx_ was Plentifully enough laid on, for where\r\nit was laid on but very Thinly, the Stain was not quite of so Deep a\r\nColour.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XI_\r\n\r\nThe Cause of the Blackness of those many Nations, which by one common Name\r\nwe are wont to call _Negroes_, has been long since Disputed of by Learned\r\nMen, who possibly had not done amiss, if they had also taken into\r\nConsideration, why some whole races of other Animals besides Men, as Foxes\r\nand Hares, are Distinguish'd by a Blackness not familiar to the Generality\r\nof Animals of the same Species; The General Opinion (to be mention'd a\r\nlittle lower) has been rejected even by some of the Antient Geographers,\r\nand among our Moderns _Ortelius_ and divers other Learned Men have\r\nQuestion'd it. But this is no place to mention what thoughts I have had to\r\nand fro about these Matters: Only as I shall freely Acknowledge, that to me\r\nthe inquiry seems more Abstruse than it does to many others, and that\r\nbecause consulting with Authors, and with Books of Voyages, and with\r\nTravellers, to satisfie my self in matters of Fact, I have met with some\r\nthings among them, which seem not to agree very well with the Notions of\r\nthe most Classick Authors concerning these things; for it being my Present\r\nWork to deliver rather matters Historical than Theorys, I shall Annex Some\r\nfew of my Collections, instead of a Solemn Disputation. It is commonly\r\npresum'd that the Heat of the Climate wherein they live, is the reason, why\r\nso many Inhabitants of the Scorching Regions of _Africa_ are Black; and\r\nthere is this familiar Observation to Countenance this Conjecture, That we\r\nplainly see that Mowers, Reapers, and other Countrey-people, who spend the\r\nmost part of the Hot Summer dayes expos'd to the Sun, have the skin of\r\ntheir Hands and Faces, which are the parts immediately Expos'd to the Sun\r\nand Air, made of a Darker Colour than before, and consequently tending to\r\nBlackness; And Contrarywise we observe that the _Danes_ and some other\r\npeople that Inhabit Cold Climates, and even the _English_ who feel not so\r\nRigorous a Cold, have usually Whiter faces than the _Spaniards_,\r\n_Portugalls_ and other European Inhabitants of Hotter Climates. But this\r\nArgument I take to be far more Specious than Convincing; for though the\r\nHeat of the Sun may Darken the Colour of the Skin, by that Operation, which\r\nwe in _English_ call Sun-burning, yet Experience doth not Evince, that I\r\nremember, That that Heat alone can produce a Discolouring that shall amount\r\nto a true Blackness, like that of _Negroes_, and we shall see by and by\r\nthat even the Children of some _Negroes_ not yet 10. dayes Old (perhaps not\r\nso much by three quarters of that time) will notwithstanding their Infancy\r\nbe of the same Hue with their Parents. Besides, there is this strong\r\nArgument to be alleg'd against the Vulgar Opinion, that in divers places in\r\n_Asia_ under the same Parallel, or even of the same Degree of Latitude with\r\nthe _African_ Regions Inhabited by Blacks, the People are at most but\r\nTawny;[10] And in _Africa_ it self divers Nations in the Empire of\r\n_Ethiopia_ are not _Negroes_, though Situated in the Torrid Zone, and as\r\nneer the Æquinoctial, as other Nations that are so (as the Black\r\nInhabitants of _Zeylan_ and _Malabar_ are not in our Globes plac'd so near\r\nthe Line as _Amara_ the Famousest place in _Ethiopia_.) Moreover, (that\r\nwhich is of no small Moment in our present Disquisition) I find not by the\r\nbest Navigators and Travellers to the _West-Indies_, whose Books or\r\nthemselves I have consulted on this Subject, that excepting perhaps one\r\nplace or two of small extent, there are any Blacks Originally Natives of\r\nany part of _America_ (for the Blacks now there have been by the\r\n_Europeans_ long Transplanted thither) though the New World contain in it\r\nso great a Variety of Climates, and particularly reach quite Cross the\r\nTorri'd Zone from one Tropick to another. And enough it be true that the\r\n_Danes_ be a Whiter People than the _Spaniards_, yet that may proceed\r\nrather from other causes (not here to be enquired into) than from the\r\nColdness of the Climate, since not onely the _Swedes_ and other Inhabitants\r\nof those Cold Countreys, are not usually so White as the _Danes_, nor\r\nWhiter than other Nations in proportion to their Vicinity to the Pole. [And\r\nsince the Writing of the former part of this Essay, having an opportunity\r\non a Solemn occasion to take Notice of the Numerous Train of Some\r\nExtraordinary Embassadours sent from the _Russian_ Emperour to a great\r\nMonarch, observ'd, that (though it were then Winter) the Colour of their\r\nHair and Skin was far less Whitish than the _Danes_ who Inhabit a milder\r\nRegion is wont to be, but rather for the most part of a Darkish Brown; And\r\nthe Physician to the Embassadour with whom those _Russes_ came, being ask'd\r\nby me whether in _Muscovy_ it self the Generality of the People were more\r\ninclin'd to have Dark-colour'd Hair than Flaxen, he answer'd Affirmatively;\r\nbut seem'd to suspect that the True and Antient _Russians_, a Sept of whom\r\nhe told me he had met with in one of the Provinces of that vast Empire,\r\nwere rather White like the _Danes_, than any thing near so Brown as the\r\npresent _Muscovites_ whom he guesses to be descended of the _Tartars_, and\r\nto have inherited their Colour from them.] But to Prosecute our former\r\nDiscourse, I shall add for further Proof of the Conjecture I was\r\ncountenancing that good Authors inform us that there are _Negroes_ in\r\n_Africa_ not far from the _Cape of good Hope_, and consequently beyond the\r\nSouthern Tropick, and without the Torrid Zone, much about the same Northern\r\nLatitude (or very little more) wherein there are divers _American_ Nations\r\nthat are not _Negroes_, and wherein the Inhabitants of _Candia_, some parts\r\nof _Sicily_, and even of _Spain_ are not so much as Tawny-Mores. But (which\r\nis a fresh and strong Argument against the common Opinion,) I find by our\r\nrecent Relations of _Greenland_ (our Accounts whereof we owe to the\r\nCuriosity of that Royal _Virtuoso_ the present King of _Denmark_,) that the\r\nInhabitants are Olive-colour'd, or rather of a Darker Hiew. But if the Case\r\nwere the same with Men, and those other kinds of Animals I formerly nam'd,\r\nI should offer something as a considerable proof, That, Cold may do much\r\ntowards the making Men White or Black, and however I shall let down the\r\nObservation as I have met with it, as worthy to come into the History of\r\nWhiteness and Blackness, and it is, that in some parts of _Russia_ and of\r\n_Livonia_ it is affirm'd by _Olaus Magnus_ and others, that Hares and Foxes\r\n(some add Partridges) which before were Black, or Red, or Gray, do in the\r\ndepth of Winter become White by reason of the great Cold; (for that it\r\nshould be, as some conceive, by Looking upon the Snow, seems improbable\r\nupon divers accounts) And I remember that having purposely enquir'd of a\r\n_Virtuoso_ who lately Travell'd through _Livonia_ to _Mosco_ concerning the\r\nTruth of this Tradition, he both told me, he believ'd it, and added, that\r\nhe saw divers of those lately nam'd Animals either in _Russia_ or\r\n_Livonia_, (for I do not very well remember whether of the two) which,\r\nthough White when he saw them in Winter, they assur'd him had been Black,\r\nor of other Colours before the Winter began, and would be so again when it\r\nwas over. But for further satisfaction, I also consulted one that had for\r\nsome years been an Eminent Physician in _Russia_, who though he rejected\r\nsome other Traditions that are generally enough believ'd concerning that\r\nCountrey, told me nevertheless, that he saw no cause to doubt of this\r\nTradition of _Olaus Magnus_ as to Foxes and Hares, not onely because 'tis\r\nthe common and uncontroul'd Assertion of the Natives, but also because he\r\nhimself in the Winter could never that he remember'd see Foxes and Hares of\r\nany other Colour than White; And I my self having seen a small White Fox\r\nbrought out of _Russia_ into _England_ towards the latter end of Winter,\r\nforetold those that shew'd him me, that he would change Colour in Summer,\r\nand accordingly coming to look upon him again in _July_, I found that the\r\nBack and Sides, together with the upper part of the Head and Tayl were\r\nalready grown of a Dark Colour, the lower part of the Head and Belly\r\ncontaining as yet a Whiteness. Let me add, that were it not for some\r\nscruple I have, I should think more than what _Olaus_ relates, confirm'd by\r\nthe judicious _Olearius_, who was twice employ'd into those parts as a\r\nPublick Minister, who in his Account of _Moscovy_ has this Passage: _The\r\nHares there are Gray; but in some Provinces they grow white in the Winter_.\r\nAnd within some few Lines after: _It is not very Difficult to find the\r\nCause of this Change, which certainly proceeds only from the Outward Cold,\r\nsince I know that even in Summer, Hares will change Colour, if they be kept\r\na competent time in a Cellar_; I say, were it not for Some Scruple, because\r\nI take notice, that in the same Page the Author Affirms, that the like\r\nchange of Colour that happens to Hares in some Provinces of _Muscovy_,\r\nhappens to them also in _Livonia_, and yet immediately subjoyns, that in\r\n_Curland_ the Hares vary not their Colour in Winter, though these two last\r\nnamed Countries be contiguous, (that is) sever'd only by the River of\r\n_Dugna_; For it is scarce conceivable how Cold alone should have, in\r\nCountries so near, so strangely differing an operation, though no less\r\nstrange a thing is confess'd by many, that ascribe the Complexion of\r\n_Negroes_ to the Heat of the Sun, when they would have the River of\r\n_Cenega_ so to bound the _Moors_, that though on the North-side they are\r\nbut Tawny, on the other side they are Black.\r\n\r\n  [10] Olearius Voyage de Mosco. et de Perse _liv_. 3.\r\n\r\nThere is another Opinion concerning the Complexion of _Negroes_, that is\r\nnot only embrac'd by many of the more Vulgar Writers, but likewise by that\r\ningenious Traveller Mr. _Sandys_, and by a late most learned Critick,\r\nbesides other men of Note, and these would have the Blackness of _Negroes_\r\nan effect of _Noah's_ Curse ratify'd by God's, upon _Cham_; But though I\r\nthink that even a Naturalist may without disparagement believe all the\r\nMiracles attested by the Holy Scriptures, yet in this case to flye to a\r\nSupernatural Cause, will, I fear, look like Shifting off the Difficulty,\r\ninstead of Resolving it; for we enquire not the First and Universal, but\r\nthe Proper, Immediate, and Physical Cause of the Jetty Colour of _Negroes_;\r\nAnd not only we do not find expressed in the Scripture, that the Curse\r\nmeant by _Noah_ to _Cham_, was the Blackness of his Posterity, but we do\r\nfind plainly enough there that the Curse was quite another thing, namely\r\nthat he should be a Servant of Servants, that is by an Ebraism, a very\r\nAbject Servant to his Brethren, which accordingly did in part come to pass,\r\nwhen the _Israelites_ of the posterity of _Sem_, subdued the _Canaanites_,\r\nthat descended from _Cham_, and kept them in great Subjection. Nor is it\r\nevident that Blackness is a Curse, for Navigators tell us of Black Nations,\r\nwho think so much otherwise of their own condition, that they paint the\r\nDevil White. Nor is Blackness inconsistent with Beauty, which even to our\r\nEuropean Eyes consists not so much in Colour, as an Advantageous Stature, a\r\nComely Symmetry of the parts of the Body, and Good Features in the Face. So\r\nthat I see not why Blackness should be thought such a Curse to the\r\n_Negroes_, unless perhaps it be, that being wont to go Naked in those Hot\r\nClimates, the Colour of their Skin does probably, according to the Doctrine\r\nabove deliver'd, make the Sun-beams more Scorching to them, than they would\r\nprove to a people of a White Complexion.\r\n\r\nGreater probability there is, That the Principal Cause (for I would not\r\nexclude all concurrent ones) of the Blackness of _Negroes_ is some Peculiar\r\nand Seminal Impression, for not onely we see that _Blackmore_ boyes brought\r\nover into these Colder Climates lose not their Colour; But good Authors\r\ninform us, That the Off-spring of _Negroes_ Transplanted out of _Africa_,\r\nabove a hundred years ago, retain still the Complexion of their\r\nProgenitors, though possibly in Tract of time it will decay; As on the\r\nother side, the White people removing into very Hot Climates, have their\r\nSkins by the Heat of the Sun scorch'd into Dark Colours; yet neither they,\r\nnor their Children have been observ'd, even in the Countreys of _Negroes_,\r\nto descend to a Colour amounting to that of the Natives; whereas I remember\r\nI have Read in _Pisos_[11] excellent account of _Brasile_, that betwixt the\r\n_Americans_ and _Negroes_ are generated a distinct sort of Men, which they\r\ncall _Cabocles_, and betwixt _Portugalls_ and _Æthiopian_ women, He tells\r\nus, he has sometimes seen Twins, whereof one had a White skin, the other a\r\nBlack; not to mention here some other instances, he gives, that the\r\nproductions of the mixtures of differing people, that is (indeed,) the\r\neffects of Seminal Impressions which they consequently argue to have been\r\ntheir Causes; and we shall not much scruple at this, if we consider, that\r\neven Organical parts may receive great Differences from such peculiar\r\nImpressions, upon what account soever they came to be setled in the first\r\nIndividual persons, from whom they are Propogated to Posterity, as we see\r\nin the Blobber-Lips and Flat-Noses of most Nations of _Negroes_. And if we\r\nmay Credit what Learned men deliver concerning the Little Feet of the\r\n_Chinesses_, the _Macrocephali_ taken notice of by _Hippocrates_, will not\r\nbe the only Instance we might apply to our present purpose. And on this\r\noccasion it will not perchance be Impertinent to add something of what I\r\nhave observ'd in other Animals, as that there is a sort of Hens that want\r\nRumps; And that (not to mention that in several places there is a sort of\r\nCrows or Daws that are not Cole-black as ours, but partly of a Whitish\r\nColour) in spight of _Porphyries_ examples of Inseparable Accidents, I have\r\nseen a perfectly White Raven, as to Bill as well as Feathers, which I\r\nattentively considered, for fear of being impos'd upon. And this recalls\r\ninto my Memory, what a very Ingenious Physician has divers times related to\r\nme of a young Lady, to whom being call'd, he found that though she much\r\ncomplain'd of want of Health, yet there appear'd so little cause either in\r\nher Body, or her Condition to Guess that She did any more than fancy her\r\nself Sick, that scrupling to give her Physick, he perswaded her Friends\r\nrather to divert her Mind by little Journeys of Pleasure, in one of which\r\ngoing to Visit St. _Winifrids_ Well, this Lady, who was a _Catholick_, and\r\ndevout in her Religion, and a pretty while in the Water to perform some\r\nDevotions, and had occasion to fix her Eyes very attentively upon the Red\r\npipple-stones, which in a scatter'd order made up a good part of those that\r\nappear'd through the water, and a while after growing Bigg, she was\r\ndeliver'd of a Child, whose White Skin was Copiously speckl'd with spots of\r\nthe Colour and Bignesss of those Stones, and though now this Child have\r\nalready liv'd several years, yet she still retains them. I have but two\r\nthings to add concerning the Blackness of _Negroes_, the one is, that the\r\nSeat of that Colour seems to be but the thin _Epidermes_, or outward Skin,\r\nfor I knew a young _Negroe_, who having been lightly Sick of the Small Pox\r\nor Measles, (for it was doubted which of the two was his Disease) I found\r\nby enquiry of a person that was concern'd for him, that in those places\r\nwhere the little Tumors had broke their passage through the Skin, when they\r\nwere gone, they left Within specks behind them; And the lately commended\r\n_Piso_ assures us, that having the opportunity in _Brasil_ to Dissect many\r\n_Negroes_, he cleerly found that their Blackness went no deeper than the\r\nvery outward Skin, which _Cuticula_ or _Epidermis_ being remov'd, the\r\nundermost Skin or _Cutis_ appear'd just as White as that of _Europæan_\r\nBodyes. And the like has been affirmed to me by a Physician of our own,\r\nwhom, hearing he had Dissectcd a _Negroe_ here in _England_, I consulted\r\nabout this particular. The other thing to be here taken notice of\r\nconcerning _Negroes_ is, That having enquir'd of an Intelligent\r\nacquaintance of mine (who keeps in the _Indies_ about 300. of them as well\r\nWomen as Men to work in his Plantations,) whether their Children come Black\r\ninto the world; he answer'd, That they did not, but were brought forth of\r\nalmost the like Reddish Colour with our _European_ Children; and having\r\nfurther enquir'd, how long it was before these Infants appear'd Black, be\r\nreply'd, that 'twas not wont to be many daies. And agreeable to this\r\naccount I find that, given us in a freshly publish'd French Book written by\r\na _Jesuit_, that had good opportunity of Knowing the Truth of what he\r\nDelivers, for being one of the Missionaries of his Order into the Southern\r\n_America_ upon the Laudable Design of Converting Infidels to Christianity,\r\nhe Baptiz'd several Infants, which when newly Born, were much of the same\r\nColour with _European_ Babes, but within about a Week began to appear of\r\nthe Hue of their Parents. But more Pregnant is the Testimony of our\r\nCountrey-man _Andrew Battel_, who being sent Prisoner by the _Portugalls_\r\nto _Angola_, liv'd there, and in the adjoyning Regions, partly as a\r\nPrisoner, partly as a Pilot, and partly as a Souldier, near 18. years, and\r\nhe mentioning the _African_ Kingdom of _Longo_, peopl'd with Blacks, has\r\nthis passage:[12] _The Children in this Countrey are Born White, and change\r\ntheir Colour in two dayes to a Perfect Black_. As for Example, _The_\r\nPortugalls _which dwell in the Kingdome of_ Longo _have sometimes Children\r\nby the_ Negroe_-women, and many times the Fathers are deceived, thinking,\r\nwhen the Child is Born, that it is theirs, and within two dayes it proves\r\nthe Son or Daughter of a_ Negroe,_ which the_ Portugalls _greatly grieve\r\nat_; And the same person has elsewhere a Relation, which, if he have made\r\nno use at all of the liberty of a Traveller, is very well worth our Notice,\r\nsince this, together with that we have formerly mention'd of Seminal\r\nImpressions, shews a possibility, that a Race of _Negroes_ might be begun,\r\nthough none of the Sons of _Adam_, for many Precedent Generations were of\r\nthat Complexion. For I see not why it should not be at least as possible,\r\nthat White Parents may sometimes have Black Children, as that _African\r\nNegroes_ should sometimes have lastingly White ones, especially since\r\nconcurrent causes may easily more befriend the Productions of the Former\r\nkind, than under the scorching Heat of _Africa_ those of the Latter. And I\r\nremember on the occasion of what he delivers, that of the White Raven\r\nformerly mention'd, the Possessor affirm'd to me, that in the Nest out of\r\nwhich he was taken White, they found with him but one other Young one, and\r\nthat he was of as Jetty a Black as any common Raven. But let us hear our\r\nAuthor himself[13]; _Here are_ (sayes he, speaking of the formerly\r\nmention'd Regions) _Born in this Countrey White Children, which is very\r\nrare among them, for their Parents are_ Negroes; _And when any of them are\r\nBorn, they are presented to the King, and are call'd_ Dondos; _these are as\r\nWhite as any White Men. These are the Kings Witches, and are brought up in\r\nWitchcraft, and alwayes wait on the King: There is no man that dare meddle\r\nwith these_ Dondos, _if they go to the Market they may take what they lift,\r\nfor all Men stand in awe of them. The King of_ Longo _hath four of them_.\r\nAnd yet this Countrey in our Globes is plac'd almost in the midst of the\r\nTorrid Zone (four or five Degrees Southward of the Line.) And our Author\r\nelsewhere tells us of the Inhabitants, that they are so fond of their\r\nBlackness, that they will not suffer any that is not of that Colour (as the\r\n_Portugalls_ that come to Trade thither) to be so much as Buri'd in their\r\nLand, of which he annexes a particular example,[14] that may be seen in his\r\nVoyage preserv'd by our Industrious Countreyman Mr. _Purchas_. But it is\r\nhigh time for me to dismiss Observations, and go on with Experiments.\r\n\r\n  [11] _Piso_ Nat. & Med. Hist. _Brasil. lib_ 1. in fine.\r\n\r\n  [12] _Purchas_ Pilgrim.

Ibid.\r\n\r\n  [14] _Purchas_ Ibid. in fin\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XII._\r\n\r\nThe way, _Pyrophilus,_ of producing Whiteness by Chymical Præcipitations is\r\nvery well worth our observing, for thereby Bodyes of very Differing Colours\r\nas well as Natures, though dissolv'd in Several Liquors, are all brought\r\ninto _Calces_ or Powders that are White. Thus we find that not only\r\nCrabs-eyes, that are of themselves White, and Pearls that are almost so,\r\nbut _Coral_ and _Minium_ that are Red, being dissolv'd in Spirit of\r\nVinegar, may be uniformly Præcipitated by Oyl of _Tartar_ into White\r\nPowders. Thus Silver and Tin separately dissolv'd in _Aqua Fortis_, will\r\nthe one Præcipitate it self, and the other be Præcipitated by common\r\nSalt-water into a White _Calx_, and so will Crude Lead and Quicksilver\r\nfirst dissolv'd likewise in _Aqua Fortis_. The like _Calx_ will be afforded\r\nas I have try'd by a Solution of that shining Mineral Tinglass dissolv'd in\r\n_Aqua Fortis_, and Præcipitated out of it; and divers of these _Calces_ may\r\nbe made at least as Fair and White, if not better Colour'd, if instead of\r\nOyl of _Tartar_ they were Præcipitated with Oyl of _Vitriol_, or with\r\nanother Liquor I could Name. Nay, that Black Mineral _Antimony_ it self,\r\nbeing reduc'd by and with the Salts that concurr to the Composition of\r\ncommon Sublimate, into that Cleer though Unctuous Liquor that Chymists\r\ncommonly call Rectifi'd Butter of _Antimony_, will by the bare affusion of\r\nstore of Fair Water be struck down into that Snow-white Powder, which when\r\nthe adhering Saltness is well wash'd off, Chymists are pleas'd to call\r\n_Mercurius Vitæ_, though the like Powder may be made of _Antimony_, without\r\nthe addition of any _Mercury_ at all. And this Lactescence if I may so call\r\nit, does also commonly ensue when Spirit of Wine, being Impregnated with\r\nthose parts of Gums or other Vegetable Concretions, that are suppos'd to\r\nabound with Sulphureous Corpuscles, fair Water is suddenly pour'd upon the\r\nTincture or Solution. And I remember that very lately I did, for Tryal\r\nsake, on a Tincture of _Benjamin_ drawn with Spirit of Wine, and brought to\r\nbe as Red as Blood, pour some fair Water, which presently mingling with the\r\nLiquor, immediately turn'd the whole Mixture White. But if such Seeming\r\nMilks be suffer'd to stand unstirr'd for a convenient while, they are wont\r\nto let fall to the bottome a Resinous Substance, which the Spirit of Wine\r\nDiluted and Weakned by the Water pour'd into it was unable to support any\r\nlonger. And something of Kin to this change of Colour in Vegetables is\r\nthat, which Chymists are wont to observe upon the pouring of Acid Spirits\r\nupon the Red Solution of _Sulphur_, dissolv'd in an Infusion of Pot-ashes,\r\nor in some other sharp _Lixivium_, the Præcipitated _Sulphur_ before it\r\nsubsides, immediately turning the Red Liquor into a White one. And other\r\nExamples might be added of this way of producing Whiteness in Bodyes by\r\nPræcipitating them out of the Liquors wherein they have been Dissolv'd; but\r\nI think it may be more usefull to admonish you, _Pyrophilus_, that this\r\nobservation admits of Restrictions, and is not so Universal, as by this\r\ntime perhaps you have begun to think it; For though most Præcipitated\r\nBodyes are White, yet I know some that are not; For Gold Dissolv'd in _Aqua\r\nRegis_, whether you Præcipitate it with Oyl of _Tartar_, or with Spirit of\r\n_Sal Armoniack_, will not afford a White but a Yellow _Calx_. _Mercury_\r\nalso though reduc'd into Sublimate, and Præcipitated with Liquors abounding\r\nwith Volatile Salts, as the Spirits drawn from Urine, Harts-horn, and other\r\nAnimal substances, yet will afford, as we Noted in our first Experiment\r\nabout Whiteness and Blackness, a White Præcipitate, yet with some Solutions\r\nhereafter to be mentioned, it will let fall an Orange-Tawny Powder. And so\r\nwill Crude _Antimony_, if, being dissolv'd in a strong Lye, you pour (as\r\nfarr as I remember) any Acid Liquor upon the Solution newly Filtrated,\r\nwhilst it is yet Warm. And if upon the Filtrated Solution of _Vitriol_, you\r\npour a Solution of one of these fix'd Salts, there will subside a Copious\r\nsubstance, very farr from having any Whiteness, which the Chymists are\r\npleas'd to call, how properly I have elsewhere examin'd, the _Sulphur of\r\nVitriol_. So that most part of Dissolv'd Bodyes being by Præcipitation\r\nbrought to White Powders, and yet some affording Præcipitates of other\r\nColours, the reason of both the Phænomena may deserve to be enquir'd into.\r\n\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XIII._\r\n\r\nSome Learned Modern Writers[15] are of Opinion, that the Account upon which\r\nWhiteness and Blackness ought to be call'd, as they commonly are, the two\r\nExtreme Colours, is, That Blackness (by which I presume is meant the Bodyes\r\nendow'd with it) receives no other Colours; but Whiteness very easily\r\nreceives them all; whence some of them compare Whiteness to the\r\n_Aristotelian Materia prima_, that being capable of any sort of Forms, as\r\nthey suppose White Bodyes to be of every kind of Colour. But not to Dispute\r\nabout Names or Expressions, the thing it self that is affirm'd as Matter of\r\nFact, seems to be True enough in most Cases, not in all, or so, as to hold\r\nUniversally. For though it be a common observation among Dyers, That\r\nClothes, which have once been throughly imbu'd with Black, cannot so well\r\nafterwards be Dy'd into Lighter Colours, the præexistent Dark Colour\r\ninfecting the Ingredients, that carry the Lighter Colour to be introduc'd,\r\nand making it degenerate into Some more Sad one; Yet the Experiments lately\r\nmention'd may shew us, that where the change of Colour in Black Bodies is\r\nattempted, not by mingling Bodyes of Lighter Colours with them, but by\r\nAddition of such things as are proper to alter the Texture of those\r\nCorpuscles that contain the Black Colour, 'tis no such difficult matter, as\r\nthe lately mention'd Learned Men imagine, to alter the Colour of Black\r\nBodyes. For we saw that Inks of several Kinds might in a trice be depriv'd\r\nof all their Blackness; and those made with Logwood and Red-Roses might\r\nalso be chang'd, the one into a Red, the other into a Reddish Liquor; and\r\nwith Oyl of _Vitriol_ I have sometimes turn'd Black pieces of Silk into a\r\nkind of Yellow, and though the Taffaty were thereby made Rotten, yet the\r\nspoyling of that does no way prejudice the Experiment, the change of Black\r\nSilk into Yellow, being never the less True, because the Yellow Silk is the\r\nless good. And as for Whiteness, I think the general affirmation of its\r\nbeing so easily Destroy'd or Transmuted by any other Colour, ought not to\r\nbe receiv'd without some Cautions and Restrictions. For whereas, according\r\nto what I formerly Noted, Lead is by Calcination turned into that Red\r\nPowder we call _Minium_; And Tin by Calcination reduc'd to a White _Calx_,\r\nthe common Putty that is sold and us'd so much in Shops, instead of being,\r\nas it is pretended and ought to be, only the _Calx_ of Tin, is, by the\r\nArtificers that make it, to save the charge of Tin, made, (as some, of\r\nthemselves have confess'd, and as I long suspected by the Cheap rate it may\r\nbe bought for) but of half Tin and half Lead, if not far more Lead than\r\nTin, and yet the Putty in spight of so much Lead is a very White Powder,\r\nwithout disclosing any mixture of _Minium_. And so if you take two parts of\r\nCopper, which is a High-colour'd Metall, to but one of Tin, you may by\r\nFusion bring them into one Mass, wherein the Whiteness of the Tin is much\r\nmore Conspicuous and Predominant than the Reddishness of the Copper. And on\r\nthis occasion it may not be Impertinent to mention an Experiment, which I\r\nrelate upon the Credit of a very Honest man, whom I purposely enquir'd of\r\nabout it, being my self not very fond of making Tryals with _Arsenick_, the\r\nExperiment is this, That if you Colliquate _Arsenick_ and Copper in a due\r\nproportion, the _Arsenick_ will Blanch the Copper both within and without,\r\nwhich is an Experiment well enough Known; but when I enquir'd, whether or\r\nno this White mixture being skilfully kept a while upon the Cupel would not\r\nlet go its _Arsenick_, which made Whiteness its prædominant Colour, and\r\nreturn to the Reddishness of Copper, I was assur'd of the Affirmative; so\r\nthat among Mineral Bodyes, some of those that are White, may be far more\r\ncapable, than those I am reasoning with seem to have known, of Eclipsing\r\nothers, and of making their Colour Prædominant in Mixtures. In further\r\nConfirmation of which may be added, that I remember that I also took a lump\r\nof Silver and Gold melted together, wherein by the Æstimate of a very\r\nExperienced Refiner, there might be about a fourth or third part of Gold,\r\nand yet the Yellow Colour of the Gold was so hid by the White of the\r\nSilver, that the whole Mass appear'd to be but Silver, and when it was\r\nrubb'd upon the Touchstone, an ordinary beholder could scarce have\r\ndistinguish'd it from the Touch of common Silver; though if I put a little\r\n_Aqua Fortis_ upon any part of the White Surface it had given the\r\nTouchstone, the Silver in the moistned part being immediately taken up and\r\nconceal'd by the Liquor, the Golden Particles would presently disclose that\r\nnative Yellow, and look rather as if Gold, than if the above mention'd\r\nmixture, had been rubb'd upon the Stone.\r\n\r\n  [15] See _Scaliger_ Exercit. 325. Sect. 9.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XIV._\r\n\r\nI took a piece of Black-horn, (polish'd as being part of a Comb) this with\r\na piece of broken glass I scrap'd into many thin and curdled flakes, some\r\nshorter and some longer, and having laid a pretty Quantity of these\r\nscrapings together, I found, as I look'd for, that the heap they compos'd\r\nwas White, and though, if I laid it upon a clean piece of White Paper, its\r\nColour seem'd somewhat Eclips'd by the greater Whiteness of the Body it was\r\ncompar'd with, looking somewhat like Linnen that had been sulli'd by a\r\nlittle wearing, yet if I laid it upon a very Black Body, as upon a Beaver\r\nHatt, it then appear'd to be of a good White, which Experiment, that you\r\nmay in a trice make when you please, seems very much to Disfavour both\r\ntheir Doctrine that would have Colours to flow from the Substantial Forms\r\nof Bodyes, and that of the Chymists also, who ascribe them to one or other\r\nof their three Hypostatical Principles; for though in our Case there was so\r\ngreat a Change made, that the same Body without being substantially either\r\nIncreas'd or Lessened, passes immediately from one extreme Colour to\r\nanother (and that too from Black to White) yet this so great and sudden\r\nchange is effected by a slight Mechanical Transposition of parts, there\r\nbeing no Salt or _Sulphur_ or _Mercury_ that can be pretended to be Added\r\nor Taken away, nor yet any substantial Form that can reasonably be suppos'd\r\nto be Generated and Destroy'd, the Effect proceeding only from a Local\r\nMotion of the parts which so vary'd their Position as to multiply their\r\ndistinct Surfaces, and to Qualifie them to Reflect far more Light to the\r\nEye, than they could before they were scrap'd off from the entire piece of\r\nBlack horn.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XV._\r\n\r\nAnd now, _Pyrophilus_, it will not be improper for us to take some notice\r\nof an Opinion touching the cause of Blackness, which I judged it not so\r\nseasonable to Question, till I I had set down some of the Experiments, that\r\nmight justifie my dissent from it. You know that of late divers Learned\r\nMen, having adopted the three Hypostatical Principles, besides other\r\nNotions of the Chymists, are very inclinable to reduce all Qualities of\r\nBodies to one or other of those three Principles, and Particularly assign\r\nfor the cause of Blackness the Sootie steam of _adust_ or _torrifi'd\r\nSulphur_. But I hope that what we have deliver'd above to countenance the\r\nOpinion we have propos'd about the Cause of Blackness, will so easily\r\nsupply you with several Particulars that may be made use of against this\r\nOpinion, that I shall now represent to You but two things concerning it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd First it seems that the favourers of the Chymicall Theories might have\r\npitcht upon some more proper term, to express the Efficient of Blackness\r\nthan _Sulphur adust_; for we know that _common Sulphur_, not only when\r\nMelted, but even when Sublim'd, does not grow Black by suffering the Action\r\nof the fire, but continues and ascends Yellow, and rather more than less\r\nWhite, than it was before its being expos'd to the fire. And if it be set\r\non fire, as when we make that acid Liquor, that Chymists call _Oleum\r\nSulphuris per campanam_, it affords very little Soot, and indeed the flame\r\nyeelds so little, that it will scarce in any degree Black a sheet of White\r\nPaper, held a pretty while over the flame and smoak of it, which is\r\nobserved rather to Whiten than Infect linnen, and which does plainly make\r\nRed Roses grow very Pale, but not at all Black, as far as the Smoak is\r\npermitted to reach the leaves. And I can shew you of a sort of fixt Sulphur\r\nmade by an Industrious Laborant of your acquaintance, who assur'd me that\r\nhe was wont to keep it for divers weeks together night and day in a naked\r\nand Violent fire, almost like that of the Glass-house, and when, to\r\nsatisfie my Curiosity, I made him take out a lump of it, though it were\r\nglowing hot (and yet not melted,) it did not, when I had suffered it to\r\ncool, appear Black, the true Colour of it being a true Red. I know it may\r\nbe said, that _Chymists_ in the Opinion above recited mean the _Principle\r\nof Sulphur_, and not _common Sulphur_ which receives its name, not from its\r\nbeing _all_ perfectly of a Sulphureous Nature, but for that _plenty_ and\r\n_Predominancy_ of the Sulphureous Principle in it. But allowing this, 'tis\r\neasie to reply, that still according to this very Reason, torrifi'd Sulphur\r\nshould afford more Blackness, than most other concretes, wherein that\r\nPrinciple is confess'd to be far less copious. Also when I have expos'd\r\nCamphire to the fire in Close Vessels, as Inflamable, and consequenly\r\n(according to the Chymists) as Sulphureous a Body as it is, I could not by\r\nsuch a degree of Heat, as brought it to Fusion, and made it Boyl in the\r\nglass, impress any thing of Blackness, or of any other Colour, than its own\r\npure White, upon this Vegetable concrete. But what shall we say to Spirit\r\nof Wine, which being made by a Chymical Analysis of the Liquor that affords\r\nit, and being totally Inflamable, seems to have a full right to the title\r\nthey give it of _Sulphur Vegetabile_, & yet this fluid Sulphur not only\r\ncontracts not any degree of Blackness by being often so heated, as to be\r\nmade to Boyl, but when it burns away with an Actual flame, I have not found\r\nthat it would discolour a piece of White Paper held over it, with any\r\ndiscernable soot. Tin also, that wants not, according to the Chymists, a\r\n_Sulphur Joviale_, when throughly burned by the fire into a _Calx_, is not\r\nBlack, but eminently White. And I lately noted to you out of _Bellonius_,\r\nthat the Charcoals of Oxy-cedar are not of the former of these two Colours,\r\nbut of the latter. And the Smoak of our Tinby coals here in _England_, has\r\nbeen usually observ'd, rather to Blanch linnen then to Black it. To all\r\nwhich, other Particulars of the like nature might be added, but I rather\r\nchoose to put you in mind of the third Experiment, about making Black\r\nLiquors, or Inks, of Bodies that were non of them Black before. For how can\r\nit be said, that when those Liquors are put together actually Cold, and\r\ncontinue so after their mixture, there intervenes any new _Adustion of\r\nSulphur_ to produce the emergent Blackness? (and the same question will be\r\nappliable to the Blackness produc'd upon the blade of a Knife, that has cut\r\nLemmons and some kind of Sowr apples, if the juyce (though both Actually\r\nand Potentially Cold) be not quickly wip'd of) And when by the instilling\r\neither of a few drops of Oyl of Vitriol as in the second Experiment, or of\r\na little of the Liquor mention'd in the Passage pointed at in the fourth\r\nExperiment, (where I teach at once to Destroy one black Ink, and make\r\nanother) the Blackness produc'd by those Experiments is presently\r\ndestroy'd; if the Colour proceeded only from the Plenty of Sulphurous\r\nparts, torrify'd in the Black Bodies, I demand, what becomes of them, when\r\nthe Colour so suddenly dissappears? For it cannot Reasonably be said, that\r\nall those that suffic'd to make so great a quantity of Black Matter, should\r\nresort to so very small a proportion of the Clarifying Liquor, (if I may so\r\ncall it) as to be deluted by it, with out at all Denigrating it. And if it\r\nbe said that the Instill'd Liquor dispers'd those Black Corpuscles, I\r\ndemand, how that Dispersion comes to destroy their Blackness, but by making\r\nsuch a Local Motion of their parts, as destroys their former Texture? which\r\nmay be a Matter of such moment in cases like ours, that I remember that I\r\nhave in few houres, without addition, from Soot it self, attain'd pretty\r\nstore of Crystalline Salt, and good store of Transparent Liquor, and (which\r\nI have on another occasion noted as remarkable) this so Black Substance had\r\nits Colour so alter'd, by the change of Texture it receiv'd from the fire,\r\nwherewith it was distill'd, that it did for a great while afford such\r\nplenty of very white Exhalations, that the Receiver, though large, seem'd\r\nto be almost fill'd with Milk.\r\n\r\nSecondly, But were it granted, as it is in some cases not Improbable, that\r\ndivers Bodies may receive a Blackness from a Sootie Exhalation, occasion'd\r\nby the Adustion of their Sulphur, which (for the Reasons lately mention'd I\r\nshould rather call their Oyly parts;) yet still this account is applicable\r\nbut to some Particular Bodies, and will afford us no General Theory of\r\nBlackness. For if, for example, White Harts-horn, being, in Vessels well\r\nluted to each other, expos'd to the fire, be said to turn Black by the\r\nInfection of its own Smoak, I think I may justly demand, what it is that\r\nmakes the Smoak or Soot it self Black, since no Such Colour, but its\r\ncontrary, appear'd before in the Harts-horn? And with the same Reason, when\r\nwe are told, that torrify'd Sulphur makes bodies Black, I desire to be told\r\nalso, why Torrefaction makes Sulphur it self Black? nor will there be any\r\nSatisfactory Reason assign'd of these Quæries, without taking in those\r\nFertile as well as intelligible Mechanical Principles of the Position and\r\nTexture of the Minute parts of the body in reference to the Light and the\r\nEye; and these applicable Principles may Serve the turn in many cases,\r\nwhere the Adustion of Sulphur cannot be pretended; as in the appearing\r\nBlackness of an Open window, lookt upon at a somewhat remote distance from\r\nthe house, as also in the Blackness Men think they see in the Holes that\r\nhappen to be in White linnen, or Paper of the like Colour; and in the\r\nIncreasing Blackness immediatly Produc'd barely by so rubbing Velvet, whose\r\nPiles were Inclin'd before, as to reduce them to a more Erected posture, in\r\nwhich and in many other cases formerly alleg'd, there appears nothing\r\nrequisite to the Production of _the_ Blackness, but the hindering of the\r\nincident Beams of Light from rebounding plentifully enough to the Eye. To\r\nbe short, those I reason with, do concerning Blackness, what the Chymists\r\nare wont also to do concerning other Qualities, namely to content\r\nthemselves to tell us, in what Ingredient of a Mixt Body, the Quality\r\nenquir'd after, does reside, instead of explicating the Nature of it, which\r\n(to borrow a comparison from their own Laboratories) is much as if in an\r\nenquiry after the cause of Salivation, they should think it enough to tell\r\nus, that the several Kinds of Præcipitates of Gold and _Mercury_) as\r\nlikewise of Quick-silver and Silver (for I know that make and use of such\r\nPrecipitates also) do Salivate upon the account of the _Mercury_, which\r\nthough Disguis'd abounds in them, whereas the Difficulty is as much to know\r\nupon what account _Mercury_ it self, rather than other Bodies, has that\r\npower of working by Salivation. Which I say not, as though it were not\r\n_something_ (and too often the most we can arrive at) to discover in which\r\nof the Ingredients of a Compounded Body, the Quality, whose Nature is\r\nsought, resides, but because, though this Discovery it self may pass for\r\n_something_, and is oftentimes more than what is taught us about the same\r\nsubjects in the Schools, yet we ought not to think it _enough_, when more\r\nClear and Particular accounts are to be had.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                       THE\r\n               Experimental History\r\n                       OF\r\n                     COLOURS\r\n                      Begun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                 The Third PART.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                   Containing\r\n              Promiscuous Experiments\r\n                      About\r\n                     COLOURS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT I.\r\n\r\nBecause that, according to the Conjectures I have above propos'd, one of\r\nthe most General Causes of the Diversity of Colours in Opacous Bodyes, is,\r\nthat some reflect the Light mingl'd with more, others with less of Shade\r\n(either as to Quantity, or as to Interruption) I hold it not unfit to\r\nmention in the first place, the Experiments that I thought upon to examine\r\nthis Conjecture. And though coming to transcribe them out of some\r\nPhysiological _Adversaria_ I had written in loose Papers, I cannot find one\r\nof the chief Records I had of my Tryals of this Nature, yet the Papers that\r\nscap'd miscarrying, will, I presume, suffice to manifest the main thing for\r\nwhich I now allege them; I find then Among my _Adversaria_, the following\r\nNarrative.\r\n\r\n_October_ the 11. About ten in the Morning in Sun-shiny Weather, (but not\r\nwithout fleeting Clouds) we took several sorts of Paper Stain'd, some of\r\none Colour, and some of another; and in a Darken'd Room whose Window look'd\r\nSouthward, we cast the Beams that came in at a hole about three Inches and\r\na half in Diameter, upon a White wall that was plac'd on one side, about\r\nfive foot distance from them.\r\n\r\nThe White gave much the Brightest Reflection.\r\n\r\nThe Green, Red, and Blew being Compar'd together, the Red gave much the\r\nstrongest Reflection, and manifestly enough also threw its _Colour_ upon\r\nthe Wall; The Green and Blew were scarce Discernable by their Colours, and\r\nseem'd to reflect an almost Equal Light.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Compar'd with the two last nam'd, Reflected somewhat more Light.\r\n\r\nThe Red and Purple being Compar'd together, the former manifestly Reflected\r\na good deal more Light.\r\n\r\nThe Blew and Purple Compar'd together, the former seem'd to Reflect a\r\nlittle more Light, though the Purple Colour were more manifestly seen.\r\n\r\nA Sheet of very well fleck'd Marbl'd Paper being Apply'd as the others, did\r\nnot cast any or its Distinct Colours upon the Wall; nor throw its Light\r\nupon it with an Equal Diffusion, but threw the Beams Unstain'd and Bright\r\nto this and that part of the Wall, as if it's Polish had given it the\r\nNature of a specular Body. But comparing it with a sheet of White Paper, we\r\nfound the Reflection of the latter to be much Stronger, it diffusing almost\r\nas much Light to a _good Extent_ as the Marble Paper did to _one part_ of\r\nthe Wall.\r\n\r\nThe Green and Purple left us somewhat in suspence which Reflected the most\r\nLight; only the Purple seem'd to have some little Advantage over the Green,\r\nwhich was Dark in its kind.\r\n\r\nThus much I find in our above mention'd _Collections_, among which there\r\nare also some Notes concerning the Production of _Compounded Colours_, _by\r\nReflection_ from Bodyes differingly Colour'd. And these Notes we intended\r\nshould supply us with what we should mention as our second Experiment: but\r\nhaving lost the Paper that contain'd the Particulars, and remembring onely\r\nin General, that if the Objects which Reflected the Light were not Strongly\r\nColour'd and somewhat Glossy, the Reflected Beams would not manifestly make\r\na Compounded Colour upon the Wall, and even then but very Faintly, we shall\r\nnow say no more of that Matter, only reserving our selves to mention\r\nhereafter the Composition of a Green, which we still retain in Memory.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT II._\r\n\r\nWe may add, _Pyrophilus_, on this Occasion, that though a Darken'd Room be\r\nGenerally thought requisite to make the Colour of a Body appear by\r\nReflection from another Body, that is not one of those that are commonly\r\nagreed upon to be Specular (as Polish'd Metall, Quick silver, Glass, Water,\r\n&c.) Yet I have often observ'd that when I wore Doublets Lin'd with some\r\nsilken Stuff that was very Glossy and Vividly Colour'd, especially Red, I\r\ncould in an Inlightned Room plainly enough Discern the Colour, upon the\r\nPure White Linnen that came out at my Sleeve and reach'd to my Cufs; as if\r\nthat Fine White Body were more Specular, than Colour'd and Unpolish'd\r\nBodyes are thought Capable of being.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT III._\r\n\r\nWhilst we were making the newly mention'd Experiments, we thought fit to\r\ntry also what Composition of Colours might be made by Altering the Light in\r\nits Passage to the Eye by the Interposition not of Perfectly Diaphanous\r\nBodies, (that having been already try'd by others as well as by us (as we\r\nshall soon have occasion to take notice) but of Semi-opacous Bodyes, and\r\nthose such as look'd upon in an ordinary Light, and not held betwixt it and\r\nthe Eye, are not wont to be Discriminated from the rest of Opacous Bodyes;\r\nof this Tryal, our mention'd _Adversaria_ present us the following Account.\r\n\r\nHolding these Sheets, sometimes one sometimes the other of them, before the\r\nHole betwixt the Sun and the Eye, with the Colour'd sides obverted to the\r\nSun; we found them _single_ to be somewhat Transparent, and appear of the\r\nsame Colour as before, onely a little alter'd by the great Light they were\r\nplac'd in; but laying _two_ of them one over another and applying them so\r\nto the Hole, the Colours were compounded as follows.\r\n\r\nThe Blew and Yellow scarce exhibited any thing but a Darker Yellow, which\r\nwe ascrib'd to the Coarseness of the Blew Papers, and its Darkness in its\r\nKind. For applying the Blew parts of the Marbl'd Paper with the Yellow\r\nPaper after the same manner, they exhibited a good Green.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow and Red look'd upon together gave us but a Dark Red, somewhat\r\n(and but a little,) inclining to an Orange Colour.\r\n\r\nThe Purple and Red look'd on together appear'd more Scarlet.\r\n\r\nThe Purple and Yellow made an Orange.\r\n\r\nThe Green and Red made a Dark Orange Tawny.\r\n\r\nThe Green and Purple made the Purple appear more Dirty.\r\n\r\nThe Blew and Purple made the Purple more Lovely, and far more Deep.\r\n\r\nThe Red parts of the Marbl'd Paper look'd upon with the Yellow appear'd of\r\na Red far more like Scarlet than without it.\r\n\r\n                                                                [Page 191]\r\nBut the Fineness or Coarseness of the Papers, their being carefully or\r\nslightly Colour'd, and divers other Circumstances, may so vary the Events\r\nof such Experiments as these, that if, _Pyrophilus_, you would Build much\r\non them, you must carefully Repeat them.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT IV._\r\n\r\nThe Triangular Prismatical Glass being the Instrument upon whose Effects we\r\nmay the most Commodiously speculate the Nature of Emphatical Colours, (and\r\nperhaps that of Others too;) we thought it might be usefull to observe the\r\nseveral Reflections and Refractions which the Incident Beams of Light\r\nsuffer in Rebounding from it, and Passing through it. And this we thought\r\nmight be Best done, not (as is usual,) in an ordinary Inlightn'd Room,\r\nwhere (by reason of the Difficulty of doing otherwise) ev'n the Curious\r\nhave left Particulars Unheeded, which may in a convenient place be easily\r\ntaken notice of; but in a Darken'd Room, where by placing the Glass in a\r\nconvenient Posture, the Various Reflections and Refractions may be\r\nDistinctly observ'd; and where it may appear _what_ Beams are Unting'd; and\r\n_which_ they are, that upon the Bodyes that terminate them, do Paint either\r\nthe Primary or Secondary Iris. In pursuance of this we did in the above\r\nmention'd Darken'd Room, make observation of no less than four Reflections,\r\nand three Refractions that were afforded us by the same Prism, and thought\r\nthat notwithstanding what was taught us by the Rules of Catoptricks and\r\nDioptricks, it would not be amiss to find also, by hiding sometimes one\r\npart of the Prism, and sometimes another, and observing where the Light or\r\nColour Vanish'd thereupon, by which Reflection and by which Refraction each\r\nof the several places whereon the Light rebounding from, or passing\r\nthrough, the Prism appear'd either Sincere or Tincted, was produc'd. But\r\nbecause it would be Tedious and not so Intelligible to deliver this in\r\nWords, I have thought fit to Referr You to the Annexed Scheme where the\r\nNewly mention'd particulars may be at one View taken Notice of.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT V._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Explication of the Scheme._]\r\n\r\n_PPP_. An Aequilaterotriangular Crystalline Prism, one of whose edges _P_.\r\nis placed directly towards the Sun.\r\n\r\n_A B_ & [alpha] [beta] Two rays from the Sun falling on the Prism at _B_\r\n[beta]. and thence partly reflected towards _C_ & [gamma]. and partly\r\nrefracted towards _D_ & [delta].\r\n\r\n_B C_ & [beta] [gamma]. Those reflected Rays.\r\n\r\n_B D_ & [beta] [delta]. Those refracted Rays which are partly refracted\r\ntowards _E_ & [epsilon]. and there paint an Iris 1 2 3 4 5. denoting the\r\nfive consecutions of colours Red, Yellow, Green, Blew, and Purple; and are\r\npartly reflected towards _F_ & [zeta].\r\n\r\n_D F_ & [delta] [zeta]. Those Reflected Rays which are partly refracted\r\ntowards _G_ & [eta]. colourless, and partly reflected, towards _H_ &\r\n[theta].\r\n\r\n_F H_ & [zeta] [theta]. Those reflected Rays which are refracted towards\r\n_I_ & [iota]. and there paint an other fainter Iris, the colours of which\r\nare contrary to the former 5 4 3 2 1. signifying Purple, Blew, Green,\r\nYellow, Red, so that the Prism in this posture exhibits four Rainbows.\r\n\r\nI know not whether you will think it Inconsiderable to annex to this\r\nExperiment, That we observ'd in a Room not Darken'd, that the Prismatical\r\nIris (if I may so call it) might be Reflected without losing any of its\r\nseveral _Colours_ (for we now consider not their _Order_) not onely from a\r\nplain Looking-glass and from the calm Surface of Fair Water, but also from\r\na Concave Looking-glass; and that Refraction did as little Destroy those\r\nColours as Reflection. For by the help of a large (double Convex)\r\nBurning-glass through which we Refracted the Suns Beams, we found that one\r\npart of the Iris might be made to appear either beyond, or on this side of\r\nthe other Parts of the same Iris; but yet the same Vivid Colours would\r\nappear in the Displac'd part (if I may so term it) as in the other. To\r\nwhich I shall add, that having, by hiding the side of the Prism, obverted\r\nto the Sun with an Opacous Body, wherein only one small hole was left for\r\nthe Light to pass through, reduc'd the Prismatical Iris (cast upon White\r\nPaper) into a very narrow compass, and look'd upon it througn a Microscope;\r\nthe Colours appear'd the same as to kind that they did to the naked Eye.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT VI._\r\n\r\nIt may afford matter of Speculation to the Inquisitive, such as you,\r\n_Prophilus_, that as the Colours of outward Objects brought into a Darken'd\r\nRoom, do so much depend for their Visibility upon the Dimness of the Light\r\nthey are there beheld by; that the ordinary Light of the day being freely\r\nlet in upon them, they immediately disappear: so our Tryals have inform'd\r\nus, that as to the Prismatical Iris painted on the Floor by the beams of\r\nthe Sun Trajected through a Triangular-glass; though the Colours of it\r\nappear very Vivid ev'n at Noon-day, and in Sun shiny Weather, yet by a more\r\nPowerfull Light they may be made to disappear. For having sometimes, (in\r\nprosecution of some Conjectures of mine not now to be Insisted on,) taken a\r\nlarge Metalline Concave _Speculum_, and with it cast the converging Beams\r\nof the Sun upon a Prismatical Iris which I had caus'd to be projected upon\r\nthe Floor, I found that the over-powerfull Light made the Colours of the\r\nIris disappear. And if I so Reflected the Light as that it cross'd but the\r\nmiddle of the Iris, in that part only the Colours vanish'd or were made\r\nInvisible; those parts of the Iris that were on the right and left hand of\r\nthe Reflected Light (which seem'd to divide them, and cut the Iris asunder)\r\ncontinuing to exhibit the same Colours as before. But upon this we must not\r\nnow stay to Speculate.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT VII._\r\n\r\nI have sometimes thought it worth while to take notice, whether or no the\r\nColours of Opacous Bodies might not appear to the Eye somewhat Diversify'd,\r\nnot only by the Disposition of the Superficial parts of the Bodyes\r\nthemselves and by the Position of the Eye in Reference to the Object and\r\nthe Light, (for these things are Notorious enough;) but according also to\r\nthe Nature of the Lucid Body that shines upon them. And I remember that in\r\nProsecution of this Curiosity, I observ'd a manifest Difference in some\r\nKinds of Colour'd Bodyes look'd on by Day-light, and afterwards by the\r\nlight of the Moon; either directly falling on them or Reflected upon them\r\nfrom a Concave Looking-glass. But not finding at present in my Collections\r\nabout Colours any thing set down of this Kind, I shall, till I have\r\nopportunity to repeat them, content my self to add what I find Register'd\r\nconcerning Colours look'd on by Candle-light, in regard that not only the\r\nExperiment is more easie to be repeated, but the Objects being the Same\r\nSorts of Colour'd Paper lastly mention'd, the Collation of the two\r\nExperiments may help to make the Conjectures they will suggest somewhat the\r\nless uncertain.\r\n\r\nWithin a few dayes of the time above mention'd, divers Sheets of Colour'd\r\nPaper that had been look'd upon before in the Sunshine were look'd upon at\r\nnight by the light of a pretty big Candle, (snuff'd) and the Changes that\r\nwere observ'd were these.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow seem'd much fainter than in the Day, and inclinable to a pale\r\nStraw Colour.\r\n\r\nThe Red seem'd little Chang'd; but seem'd to Reflect Light more strongly\r\nthan any other Colour (for White was none of them.)\r\n\r\nA fair Deep Green look'd upon by it self seem'd to be a Dark Blew: But\r\nbeing look'd upon together with a Dark Blew, appear'd Greenish; and beheld\r\ntogether with a Yellow appear'd more Blew than at first.\r\n\r\nThe Blew look'd more like a Deep Purple or Murray than it had done in the\r\nDaylight.\r\n\r\nThe Purple seem'd very little alter'd.\r\n\r\nThe Red look'd upon with the Yellow made the Yellow look almost like Brown\r\nCap-paper.\r\n\r\n_N_. The Caution Subjoyned to the third Experiments is also Applicable to\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT VIII._\r\n\r\nBut here I must not omit to subjoyn, that to satisfie our Selves, whether\r\nor no the Light of a Candle were not made unsincere, and as it were Ting'd\r\nwith a Yellow Colour by the Admixtion of the Corpuscles it assumes from its\r\nFuel; we did not content our selves with what appears to the Naked Eye, but\r\ntaking a pretty thick Rod or Cylinder (for thin Peeces would not serve the\r\nturn) of deep Blew Glass, and looking upon the Candles flame at a\r\nConvenient distance througn it, we perceiv'd as we expected, the Flame to\r\nlook Green; which as we often note, is the Colour wont to emerge from the\r\nComposition of Opacous Bodies, which were apart one of them Blew, and the\r\nother Yellow. And this perchance may be the main Reason of that which some\r\nobserve, that a sheet of very White Paper being look'd upon by Candle\r\nlight, 'tis not easie at first to discern it from a light Yellow or Lemon\r\nColour; White Bodyes (as we have elsewhere observ'd) having more than those\r\nthat are otherwise Colour'd, of a Specular Nature; in regard that though\r\nthey exhibit not, (unless they be Polish'd,) the shape of the Luminary that\r\nshines on them, yet they Reflect its Light more Sincere and Untroubl'd, by\r\neither Shades or Refractions, than Bodyes of other Colours (as Blew, or\r\nGreen, or Yellow or the like.)\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT IX._\r\n\r\nWe took a Leaf of Such Foliated Gold as Apothecaries are wont to Gild their\r\nPills with; and with the Edge of a Knife, (lightly moysten'd by drawing it\r\nover the Surface of the Tongue, and afterwards) laid upon the edge of the\r\nGold Leaf; we so fasten'd it to the Knife, that being held against the\r\nlight, it conctinu'd extended like a little Flagg. This Leaf being held\r\nvery near the Eye, and obverted to the Light, appear'd so full of Pores,\r\nthat it seem'd to have such a kind of Transparency as that of a Sive, or a\r\npiece of Cyprus, or a Love-Hood; but the Light that pass'd by these Pores\r\nwas in its Passages So Temper'd with Shadow, and Modify'd, that the Eye\r\ndiscern'd no more a Golden Colour, but a Greenish Blew. And for other's\r\nsatisfaction, we did in the Night look upon a Candle through such a Leaf of\r\nGold; and by trying the Effect of Several Proportions of Distance betwixt\r\nthe Leaf, the Eye and the Light, we quickly hit upon such a Position for\r\nthe Leaf of Gold, as that the flame, look'd on through it, appear'd of a\r\nGreenish Blew, as we have seen in the Day time. The like Experiment try'd\r\nwith a Leaf of Silver succeeded not well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT X._\r\n\r\nWe have sometimes found in the Shops of our Druggists, a certain Wood,\r\nwhich is there called _Lignum Nephriticum_, because the Inhabitants of the\r\nCountry where it grows, are wont to use the Infusion of it made in fair\r\nWater against the Stone of the Kidneys, and indeed an Eminent Physician of\r\nour Acquaintance, who has very Particularly enquir'd into that Disease,\r\nassures me, that he has found such an Infusion one of the most effectual\r\nRemedyes, which he has ever tried against that formidable Disease. The\r\nancientest Account I have met with of this Simple, is given us by the\r\nExperienc'd _Monardes_ in these Words. _Nobis,_ says he,[16] _Nova Hispania\r\nmittit quoddam ligni genus crassum & enode, cujus usus jam diu receptus\r\nfuit in his Regionibus ad Renum vitia & urinæ difficultates ac arenulas\r\npellendas. Fit autem hac ratione, Lignum assulatim & minutim concisum in\r\nlimpidissima aqua fontana maceratur, inque ea relinquitur, donec aqua à\r\nbibentibus absumpta sit, dimidia hora post injectum lignum aqua cæruleum\r\ncolorem contrabit, qui sensim intenditur pro temporis diuturnitate, tametsi\r\nlignum candidum fit_. This Wood, _Pyrophilus_, may afford us an Experiment,\r\nwhich besides the singularity of it, may give no small assistance to an\r\nattentive Considerer towards the detection of the Nature of Colours. The\r\nExperiment as we made it is this. Take _Lignum Nephriticum_, and with a\r\nKnife cut it into thin Slices, put about a handfull of these Slices into\r\ntwo three or four pound of the purest Spring-water, let them infuse there a\r\nnight, but if you be in hast, a much shorter time may suffice; _decant_\r\nthis Impregnated Water into a clear Glass Vial, and if you hold it directly\r\nbetween the Light and your Eye, you shall see it wholly Tincted (excepting\r\nthe very top of the Liquor, wherein you will some times discern a\r\nSky-colour'd Circle) with an almost Golden Colour, unless your Infusion\r\nhave been made too Strong of the Wood, for in that case it will against the\r\nLight appear somewhat Dark and Reddish, and requires to be diluted by the\r\naddition of a convenient quantity of fair Water. But if you hold this Vial\r\nfrom the Light, so that your Eye be plac'd betwixt the Window and the Vial,\r\nthe Liquor will appear of a deep and lovely Cæruleous Colour, of which\r\nalso the drops, if any be lying on the outside of the Glass, will seem to\r\nbe very perfectly; And thus far we have try'd the Experiment, and found it\r\nto Succeed even by the Light of Candles of the larger size. If you so hold\r\nthe Vial over against your Eyes, that it may have a Window on one side of\r\nit, and a Dark part of the Room both before it and on the other side, you\r\nshall see the Liquor partly of a Blewish and partly of a Golden Colour. If\r\nturning your back to the Window, you powr out some of the Liquor towards\r\nthe Light and towards your Eyes, it will seem at the comming out of the\r\nGlass to be perfectly Cæruleous, but when it is fallen down a little way,\r\nthe drops may seem Particolour'd, according as the Beams of Light do more\r\nor less fully Penetrate and Illustrate them. If you take a Bason about half\r\nfull of Water, and having plac'd it so in the Sun-beams Shining into a\r\nRoom, that one part of the Water may be freely illustrated by the Beams of\r\nLight, and the other part of it Darkned by the shadow of the Brim of the\r\nBason, if then I say you drop of our Tincture, made somewhat strong, both\r\ninto the Shaded and Illuminated parts of the Water, you may by looking upon\r\nit from several places, and by a little Agitation of the water, observe\r\ndivers pleasing Phænomena which were tedious to particularize. If you powr\r\na little of this Tincture upon a sheet of White Paper, so as the Liquor may\r\nremain of some depth upon it, you may perceive the Neighbouring drops to be\r\npartly of one Colour, and partly of the other, according to the position of\r\nyour Eye in reference to the Light when it looks upon them, but if you powr\r\noff all the Liquor, the Paper will seem Dy'd of an almost Yellow Colour.\r\nAnd if a sheet of Paper with some of this Liquor in it be plac'd in a\r\nwindow where the Sunbeams may shine freely on it, then if you turn your\r\nback to the Sun and take a Pen or some such slender Body, and hold it\r\nover-thwart betwixt the Sun and the Liquor, you may perceive that the\r\nShadow projected by the Pen upon the Liquor, will not all of it be a vulgar\r\nand Dark, but in part a curiously Colour'd shadow, that edge of it, which\r\nis next the Body that makes it, being almost of a lively Golden Colour, and\r\nthe remoter verge of a Cæruleous one.\r\n\r\n  [16] _Nicolaus Monardes_ lib _simplic. ex India allatis_, cap. 27.\r\n\r\nThese and other Phænomena, which I have observ'd in this delightfull\r\nExperiment, divers of my friends have look'd upon not without some wonder,\r\nand I remember an excellent Oculist finding by accident in a friends\r\nChamber a fine Vial full of this Liquor, which I had given that friend, and\r\nhaving never heard any thing of the Experiment, nor having any Body near\r\nhim that could tell him what this strange Liquor might be, was a great\r\nwhile apprehensive, as he presently after told me, that some strange new\r\ndistemper was invading his Eyes. And I confess that the unusualness of the\r\nPhænomena made me very sollicitous to find out the Cause of this\r\nExperiment, and though I am far from pretending to have found it, yet my\r\nenquiries have, I suppose, enabled me to give such hints, as may lead your\r\ngreater sagacity to the discovery of the Cause of this wonder. And first\r\nfinding that this Tincture, if it were too copious in the water, Kept the\r\nColours from being so lively, and their Change from being so discernable,\r\nand finding also that the Impregnating Virtue of this Wood did by its being\r\nfrequently Infus'd in New Water by degrees Decay, I Conjectur'd that the\r\nTincture afforded by the Wood must proceed from some Subtiler parts of it\r\ndrawn forth by the Water, which swimming too and fro in it did so Modifie\r\nthe Light, as to exhibit such and such Colours; and because these Subtile\r\nparts were so easily Soluble even in Cold water, I concluded that they must\r\nabound with Salts, and perhaps contain much of the Essential Salt, as the\r\n_Chymists_ call it, of the Wood. And to try whether these Subtile parts\r\nwere Volatile enough to be Distill'd, without the Dissolution of their\r\nTexture, I carefully Distill'd some of the Tincted Liquor in very low\r\nVessels, and the gentle heat of a Lamp Furnace; but found all that came\r\nover to be as Limpid and Colourless as Rock-water, and the Liquor remaining\r\nin the Vessel to be so deeply Cæruleous, that it requir'd to be oppos'd to\r\na very strong Light to appear of any other Colour. I took likewise a Vial\r\nwith Spirit of Wine, and a little Salt of Harts-horn, and found that there\r\nwas a certain proportion to be met with betwixt the Liquor and the Salt,\r\nwhich made the Mixture fit to exhibit some little Variety of Colours not\r\nObservable in ordinary Liquors, as it was variously directed in reference\r\nto the Light and the Eye, but this Change of Colour was very far short from\r\nthat which we had admir'd in our Tincture. But however, I suspected that\r\nthe Tinging Particles did abound with such Salts, whose Texture, and the\r\nColour springing from it, would probably be alter'd by peircing Acid Salts,\r\nwhich would in likelihood either make some Dissipation of their Parts, or\r\nAssociate themselves to the like Bodies, and either way alter the Colour\r\nexhibited by them; whereupon Pouring into a small Vial full of Impregnated\r\nWater, a very little Spirit of Vinegar, I found that according to my\r\nExpectation, the Cæruleous Colour immediately vanish'd, but was deceiv'd\r\nin the Expectation I had, that the Golden Colour would do so too; for,\r\nwhich way soever I turned the Vial, either to or from the Light, I found\r\nthe Liquor to appear always of a Yellowish Colour and no other: Upon this I\r\nimagin'd that the Acid Salts of the Vinegar having been able to deprive the\r\nLiquor of its Cæruleous Colour, a Sulphureous Salt being of a contrary\r\nNature, would be able to Mortifie the Saline Particles of Vinegar, and\r\nDestroy their Effects; And accordingly having plac'd my Self betwixt the\r\nWindow, and the Vial, and into the Same Liquor dropt a few drops of Oyl of\r\nTartar _per Deliquium_, (as _Chymists_ call it) I observ'd with pleasure,\r\nthat immediately upon the Diffusion of this Liquor, the Impregnated Water\r\nwas restor'd to its former Cæruleous Colour; And this Liquor of _Tartar_\r\nbeing very Ponderous, and falling at first to the Bottom of the Vial, it\r\nwas easie to observe that for a little while the Lower part of the Liquor\r\nappear'd deeply Cæruleous; whilst all the Upper part retain'd its former\r\nYellowness, which it immediately lost as soon as either Agitation or Time\r\nhad made a competent Diffusion of the Liquor of _Tartar_ through the Body\r\nof the former Tincture; and this restored Liquor did, as it was Look'd upon\r\nagainst or from the Light, exhibit the Same _Phænomena_ as the Tincted\r\nWater did, before either of the Adventitious Liquors was pour'd into it.\r\n\r\nHaving made, _Pyrophilus_, divers Tryals upon this Nephritick Wood, we\r\nfound mention made of it by the Industrious Jesuit _Kircherus_, who having\r\nreceived a Cup Turned of it from the _Mexican_ Procurator of his Society,\r\nhas probably receiv'd also from him the Information he gives us concerning\r\nthat _Exotick_ Plant, and therefore partly for that Reason, and partly\r\nbecause what he Writes concerning it, does not perfectly agree with what we\r\nhave deliver'd, we shall not Scruple to acquaint you in his own Words, with\r\nas much of what he writes concerning our Wood, as is requisite to our\r\npresent purpose. _Hoc loco_ (says he)[17] _neutiquam omittendum duximus\r\nquoddam ligni candidi Mexicani genus, quod Indigenæ Coalle & Tlapazatli\r\nvocant, quod etsi experientia hucusque non nisi Cæruleo aquam colore\r\ntingere docuerit, nos tamen continua experientia invenimus id aquam in omne\r\nColorum genus transformare, quod merito cuipiam Paradoxum videri posset;\r\nLigni frutex grandis, ut aiunt, non rarò in molem arboris excrescit,\r\ntruncus illius eft crassus, enodis, instar piri arboris, folia ciceris\r\nfoliis, aut rutæ haud absimilia, flores exigui, oblongi, lutei & spicatim\r\ndigesti; est frigida & humida planta, licet parum recedat à medio\r\ntemperamento.

Art. Mag. lucis & umbræ, _lib. 1. part. 3._\r\n\r\nIn this passage we may take notice of the following Particulars. And first,\r\nhe calls it a White _Mexican_ Wood, whereas (not to mention that\r\n_Mornardes_ informs us that it is brought out of _Nova Hispania_) the Wood\r\nthat we have met with in several places, and employ'd as _Lignum\r\nNephriticum_, was not White, but for the most part of a much Darker Colour,\r\nnot unlike that of the Sadder Colour'd Wood of Juniper. 'Tis true, that\r\n_Monardes_ himself also says, that the Wood is White; and it is affirm'd,\r\nthat the Wood which is of a Sadder Colour is Adulterated by being Imbu'd\r\nwith the Tincture of a Vegetable, in whose Decoction it is steep'd. But\r\nhaving purposely enquir'd of the Eminentest of our _English_ Druggists, he\r\nperemptorily deny'd it. And indeed, having consider'd some of the fairest\r\nRound pieces of this Wood that I could meet with in these Parts, I had\r\nOpportunity to take notice that in one or two of them it was the External\r\npart of the Wood that was White, and the more Inward part that was of the\r\nother Colour, the contrary of which would probably have appear'd, if the\r\nWood had been Adulterated after the afore-mention'd manner. And I have at\r\npresent by me a piece of such Wood, which for about an Inch next the Bark\r\nis White, and then as it were abruptly passes to the above-mention'd\r\nColour, and yet this Wood by the Tincture, it afforded us in Water, appears\r\nto have its Colour'd part Genuine enough; for as for the White part, it\r\nappears upon tryal of both at once, much less enrich'd with the tingent\r\nProperty.\r\n\r\nNext, whereas our Author tells us, that the Infusion of this Wood expos'd\r\nin a Vial to the Light, looks like Spring-water, in which he afterwards\r\nadds, that there is no Tincture to be seen in it, our Observation and his\r\nagree not, for the Liquor, which opposed to the Darker part of a Room\r\nexhibits a Sky-colour, did constantly, when held against the Light, appear\r\nYellowish or Reddish, according as its Tincture was more Dilute or Deep;\r\nand then, whereas it has been already said, that the Cæruleous Colour was\r\nby Acid Salts abolished, this Yellowish one surviv'd without any\r\nconsiderable Alteration, so that unless our Author's Words be taken in a\r\nvery Limited Sense, we must conclude, that either his Memory mis-inform'd\r\nhim, or that his White _Nephritick_ Wood, and the Sadder Colour'd one which\r\nwe employ'd, were not altogether of the same Nature: What he mentions of\r\nthe Cup made of _Lignum Nephriticum_, we have not had Opportunity to try,\r\nnot having been able to procure pieces of that Wood great enough, and\r\notherwise fit to be turned into Cups; but as for what he says in the Title\r\nof his Experiment, that this Wood tinges the Water with all Sorts of\r\nColours, that is much more than any of those pieces of Nephritick Wood that\r\nwe have hitherto employ'd, was able to make good; The change of Colours\r\ndiscernable in a Vial full of Water, Impregnated by any of them, as it is\r\ndirected towards a place more Lightsome or Obscure, being far from\r\naffording a Variety answerable to so promising a Title. And as for what he\r\ntells us, that in the Dark the Infusion of our Wood will resume a\r\nCæruleous Colour, I wish he had Inform'd us how he Try'd it.\r\n\r\nBut this brings into my mind, that having sometimes for Curiosity sake,\r\nbrought a round Vial with a long Neck fill'd with the Tincture of _Lignum\r\nNephriticum_ into the Darken'd Room already often mention'd, and holding it\r\nsometimes in, sometimes near the Sun-beams that enter'd at the hole, and\r\nsometimes partly in them, and partly out of them, the Glass being held in\r\nseveral postures, and look'd upon from several Neighbouring parts of the\r\nRoom, disclos'd a much greater Variety of Colours than in ordinary\r\ninlightn'd Rooms it is wont to do; exhibiting, besides the usual Colours, a\r\nRed in some parts, and a Green in others, besides Intermediate Colours\r\nproduc'd by the differing Degrees, and odd mixtures of Light and Shade.\r\n\r\nBy all this You may see, _Pyrophilus_, the reasonableness of what we\r\nelsewhere had occasion to mention, when we have divers times told you, that\r\nit is usefull to have New Experiments try'd over again, though they were,\r\nat first, made by Knowing and Candid Men, such Reiterations of Experiments\r\ncommonly exhibiting some New Phænomena, detecting some Mistake or hinting\r\nsome Truth, in reference to them, that was not formerly taken notice of.\r\nAnd some of our friends have been pleas'd to think, that we have made no\r\nunusefull addition to this Experiment, by shewing a way, how in a moment\r\nour Liquor may be depriv'd of its Blewness, and restor'd to it again by the\r\naffusion of a very few drops of Liquors, which have neither of them any\r\nColour at all of their own. And that which deserves some particular wonder,\r\nis, that the Cæruleous Tincture of our Wood is subject by the former\r\nMethod to be Destroy'd or Restor'd, the Yellowish or Reddish Tincture\r\ncontinuing what it was. And that you may see, that Salts are of a\r\nconsiderable use in the striking of Colours, let me add to the many\r\nExperiments which may be afforded us to this purpose by the Dyers Trade,\r\nthis Observation; That as far as we have hitherto try'd, those Liquors in\r\ngeneral that are strong of Acid Salts have the Power of Destroying the\r\nBlewness of the Infusion of our Wood, and those Liquors indiscriminatly\r\nthat abound with Sulphureous Salts, (under which I comprehend the Urinous\r\nand Volatile Salts of Animal Substances, and the Alcalisate or fixed Salts\r\nthat are made by Incineration) have the vertue of Restoring it.\r\n\r\n_A Corollary of the Tenth Experiment._\r\n\r\nThat this Experiment, _Pyrophilus_, may be as well Usefull as Delightfull\r\nto You, I must mind You, _Pyrophilus_, that in the newly mention'd\r\nObservation, I have hinted to You a New and Easie way of Discovering in\r\nmany Liquors (for I dare not say in all) whether it be an Acid or\r\nSulphureous Salt, that is Predominant; and that such a Discovery is\r\noftentimes of great Difficulty, and may frequently be of great Use, he that\r\nis not a Stranger to the various Properties and Effects of Salts, and of\r\nhow great moment it is to be able to distinguish their Tribes, may readily\r\nconceive. But to proceed to the way of trying other Liquors by an Infusion\r\nof our Wood, take it briefly thus. Suppose I have a mind to try whether I\r\nconjecture aright, when I imagine that Allom, though it be plainly a Mixt\r\nBody, does abound rather with Acid than Sulphureous Salt. To satisfie my\r\nself herein, I turn my back to the Light, and holding a small Vial full of\r\nthe Tincture of _Lignum Nephriticum_, which look'd upon in that Position,\r\nappears Cæruleous, I drop into it a little of a strong Solution of Allom\r\nmade in Fair Water, and finding upon the Affusion and shaking of this New\r\nliquor, that the Blewness formerly conspicuous in our Tincture does\r\npresently vanish, I am thereby incited to suppose, that the Salt\r\nPrædominant in Allom belongs to the Family of Sour Salts; but if on the\r\nother side I have a mind to examine whether or no I rightly conceive that\r\nSalt of Urine, or of Harts-horn is rather of a Saline Sulphureous (if I may\r\nso speak) than of an Acid Nature, I drop a little of the Saline Spirit of\r\neither into the Nephritick Tincture, and finding that the Cæruleous Colour\r\nis rather thereby Deepned than Destroy'd, I collect that the Salts, which\r\nconstitute these Spirits, are rather Sulphureous than Acid. And to satisfie\r\nmy self yet farther in this particular, I take a small Vial of fresh\r\nTincture, and placing both it and my self in reference to the Light as\r\nformerly, I drop into the Infusion just as much Distill'd Vinegar, or other\r\nAcid liquor as will serve to Deprive it of its Blewness (which a few drops,\r\nif the Sour Liquor be strong, and the Vial small will suffice to do) then\r\nwithout changing my Posture, I drop and shake into the same Vial a small\r\nproportion of Spirit of Hartshorn or Urine, and finding that upon this\r\naffusion, the Tincture immediately recovers its Cæruleous Colour, I am\r\nthereby confirm'd firm'd in my former Opinion, of the Sulphureous Nature of\r\nthese Salts. And so, whereas it is much doubted by Some Modern Chymists to\r\nwhat sort of Salt, that which is Prædominant in Quick-lime belongs, we have\r\nbeen perswaded to referr it rather to Lixiviate than Acid Salts, by having\r\nobserv'd, that though an Evaporated Infusion of it will scarce yield such a\r\nSalt, as Ashes and other Alcalizate Bodyes are wont to do, yet if we\r\ndeprive our Nephritick Tincture of its Blewness by just so much Distill'd\r\nVinegar as is requisite to make that Colour Vanish, the _Lixivium_ of\r\nQuick-lime will immediately upon its Affusion recall the Banished Colour;\r\nbut not so Powerfully as either of the Sulphureous Liquors formerly\r\nmention'd. And therefore I allow my self to guess at the _Strength_ of the\r\nLiquors examin'd by this Experiment, by the _Quantity_ of them which is\r\nsufficient to Destroy or Restore the Cæruleous Colour of our Tincture. But\r\nwhether concerning Liquors, wherein neither Acid nor Alcalisate Salts are\r\nEminently Prædominant, our Tincture will enable us to conjecture any thing\r\nmore than that such Salts are not Prædominant in them, I take not upon me\r\nto determine here, but leave to further Tryal; For I find not that Spirit\r\nof Wine, Spirit of Tartar freed from Acidity, or Chymical Oyl of\r\nTurpentine, (although Liquors which must be conceiv'd very Saline, if\r\nChymists have, which is here no place to Dispute, rightly ascrib'd tasts to\r\nthe Saline Principle of Bodyes,) have any Remarkable Power either to\r\ndeprive our Tincture of its Cæruleous Colour, or restore it, when upon the\r\nAffusion of Spirit of Vinegar it has disappear'd.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XI._\r\n\r\nAnd here I must not omit, _Pyrophilus_, to inform You, that we can shew You\r\neven in a Mineral Body something that may seem very near of Kin to the\r\nChangeable Quality of the Tincture of _Lignum Nephriticum_, for we have\r\nseveral flat pieces of Glass, of the thickness of ordinary Panes for\r\nWindows one of which being interposed betwixt the Eye and a clear Light,\r\nappears of a Golden Colour, not much unlike that of the moderate Tincture\r\nof our Wood, but being so look'd upon as that the Beams of light are not so\r\nmuch Trajected thorough it as Reflected from it to the Eye, that Yellow\r\nseems to degenerate into a pale Blew, somewhat like that of a Turquoise.\r\nAnd what which may also appear strange, is this, that if in a certain\r\nposture you hold one of these Plates Perpendicular to the Horizon, so that\r\nthe Sun-beams shine upon half of it, the other half being Shaded, You may\r\nsee that the part Shin'd upon will be of a much Diluter Yellow than the\r\nShaded part which will appear much more Richly Colour'd; and if You alter\r\nthe Posture of the Glass, so that it be not held Perpendicular, but\r\nParallel in reference to the Horizon, You may see, (which perhaps you will\r\nadmire) the Shaded part look of a Golden Colour, but the other that the Sun\r\nshines freely on, will appear considerably Blew, and as you remove any part\r\nof the Glass thus held Horizontally into the Sun-beams or Shade, it will in\r\nthe twinkling of an Eye seem to pass from one of the above mention'd\r\nColours to the other, the Sun-beams Trajected through it upon a sheet of\r\nWhite Paper held near it, do colour it with a Yellow, somewhat bordering\r\nupon a Red, but yet the Glass may be so oppos'd to the Sun, that it may\r\nupon Paper project a mix'd Colour here and there more inclin'd to Yellow,\r\nand here and there more to Blew. The other Phænomena of this odd Glass, I\r\nfear it would be scarce worth while to Record, and therefore I shall rather\r\nadvertise You, _First_ that in the trying of these Experiments with it, you\r\nmust take notice that one of the sides has either alone, or at least\r\nprincipally its Superficial parts dispos'd to the Reflection of the Blew\r\nColour above nam'd, and that therefore you must have a care to keep that\r\nside nearest to the Eye. And next, that we have our selves made Glasses not\r\nunfit to exhibit an Experiment not unlike that I have been speaking of, by\r\nlaying upon pieces of Glass some very finely foliated Silver, and giving it\r\nby degrees a much stronger Fire than is requisite or usual for the Tinging\r\nof Glasses of other Colours. And this Experiment, not to mention that it\r\nwas made without a Furnace in which Artificers that Paint Glass are wont to\r\nbe very Curious, is the more considerable, because, that though a Skilfull\r\nPainter could not deny to me that 'twas with Silver he Colour'd his Glasses\r\nYellow; yet he told me, that when to Burn them (as they speak) he layes on\r\nthe plates of Glass nothing but a _Calx_ of Silver Calcin'd without\r\nCorrosive Liquors, and Temper'd with Fair Water, the Plates are Ting'd of a\r\nfine Yellow that looks of a Golden Colour, which part soever of it you turn\r\nto or from the Light; whereas (whether it be what an Artificer would call\r\nOver-doing, or Burning, or else the imploying the Silver Crude that makes\r\nthe Difference,) we have found more than once, that some Pieces of Glass\r\nprepar'd as we have related, though held against the Light they appear'd of\r\na Transparent Yellow, yet look'd on with ones back turn'd to the Light they\r\nexhibited an Untransparent Blew.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XII._\r\n\r\nIf you will allow me, _Pyrophilus_, for the avoiding of Ambiguity, to\r\nimploy the Word Pigments, to signifie such prepared materials (as\r\nCochinele, Vermilion, Orpiment,) as Painters, Dyers and other Artificers\r\nmake use of to impart or imitate particular Colours, I shall be the better\r\nunderstood in divers passages of the following papers, and particularly\r\nwhen I tell you, That the mixing of Pigments being no inconsiderable part\r\nof the Painters Art, it may seem an Incroachment in me to meddle with it.\r\nBut I think I may easily be excus'd (though I do not altogether pass it by)\r\nif I restrain my self to the making of a Transient mention of some few of\r\ntheir Practices about this matter; and that only so far forth, as may\r\nwarrant me to observe to you, that there are but few Simple and Primary\r\nColours (if I may so call them) from whose Various Compositions all the\r\nrest do as it were Result. For though Painters can imitate the Hues (though\r\nnot always the Splendor) of those almost Numberless differing Colours that\r\nare to be met with in the Works of Nature, and of Art, I have not yet\r\nfound, that to exhibit this strange Variety they need imploy any more than\r\n_White_, and _Black_, and _Red_, and _Blew_, and _Yellow_; these _five_,\r\nVariously _Compounded_, and (if I may so speak) _Decompounded_, being\r\nsufficient to exhibit a Variety and Number of Colours, such, as those that\r\nare altogether Strangers to the Painters Pallets, can hardly imagine.\r\n\r\nThus (for Instance) Black and White differingly mix'd, make a Vast company\r\nof Lighter and Darker Grays.\r\n\r\nBlew and Yellow make a huge Variety of Greens.\r\n\r\nRed and Yellow make Orange Tawny.\r\n\r\nRed with a little White makes a Carnation.\r\n\r\nRed with an Eye of Blew, makes a Purple; and by these simple Compositions\r\nagain Compounded among themselves, the Skilfull Painter can produce what\r\nkind of Colour he pleases, and a great many more than we have yet Names\r\nfor. But, as I intimated above, 'tis not my Design to prosecute this\r\nSubject, though I thought it not unfit to take some Notice of it, because\r\nwe may hereafter have occasion to make use of what has been now deliver'd,\r\nto illustrate the Generation of Intermediate Colours; concerning which we\r\nmust yet subjoyn this Caution, that to make the Rules about the Emergency\r\nof Colours, fit to be Relied upon, the Corpuscles whereof the Pigments\r\nconsist must be such as do not Destroy one anothers Texture, for in case\r\nthey do, the produced Colour may be very Different from that which would\r\nResult from the Mixture of other harmless Pigments of the same Colours, as\r\nI shall have Occasion to shew ere long.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XIII._\r\n\r\nIt may also give much light to an Enquirer into the Nature of Colours, to\r\nknow that not only in Green, but in many (if not all) other Colours, the\r\nLight of the Sun passing through Diaphanous Bodies of differing Hues may be\r\ntinged of the same Compound Colour, as if it came from some Painters\r\nColours of the same Denomination, though this later be exhibited by\r\nReflection, and be (as the former Experiment declares) manifestly\r\nCompounded of material Pigments. Wherefore to try the Composition of\r\nColours by Trajection, we provided several Plates of Tinged Glass, which\r\nbeing laid two at a time one on the top of another, the Object look'd upon\r\nthrough them both, appear'd of a Compounded Colour, which agrees well with\r\nwhat we have observ'd in the second Experiment, of Looking against the\r\nLight through differingly Colour'd Papers. But we thought the Experiment\r\nwould be more Satisfactory, if we procur'd the Sun-beams to be so Ting'd in\r\ntheir passage through Plates of Glass, as to exhibit the Compounded Colour\r\nupon a Sheet of White Paper. And though by reason of the Thickness of the\r\nGlasses, the Effect was but Faint, even when the Sun was High and Shin'd\r\nforth clear, yet, we easily remedied that by Contracting the Beams we cast\r\non them by means of a Convex Burning-glass, which where it made the Beams\r\nmuch converge Increas'd the Light enough to make the Compounded Colour very\r\nmanifest upon the Paper. By this means we observ'd, that the Beams\r\ntrajected through Blew and Yellow compos'd a Green, that an intense and\r\nmoderate Red did with Yellow make differing degrees of Saffron, and Orange\r\nTawny Colours, that Green and Blew made a Colour partaking of both, such as\r\nthat which some Latin Writers call _Pavonaceus_, that Red and Blew made a\r\nPurple, to which we might add other Colours, that we produc'd by the\r\nCombinations of Glasses differingly Ting'd, but that I want proper Words to\r\nexpress them in our Language, and had not when we made the Tryals, the\r\nOpportunity of consulting with a Painter, who perchance might have Suppli'd\r\nme with some of the terms I wanted.\r\n\r\nI know not whether it will be requisite to subjoyn on this Occasion, what I\r\ntried concerning Reflections from Colour'd Glasses, and other Transparent\r\nBodies, namely, that having expos'd four or five sorts of them to the Sun,\r\nand cast the Reflected Beams upon White Paper held near at hand, the Light\r\nappear'd not manifestly Ting'd, but as if it had been Reflected from the\r\nImpervious parts of a Colourless Glass, only that Reflected from the Yellow\r\nwas here and there stain'd with the same Colour, as if those Beams were not\r\nall Reflected from the Superficial, but some from the Internal parts of the\r\nGlass; upon which Occasion you may take notice, that a Skilfull Tradesman,\r\nwho makes such Colour'd Glass told me, that where as the Red Pigment was\r\nbut Superficial, the Yellow penetrated to the very midst of the Plate. But\r\nfor further Satisfaction, not having the Opportunity to Foliate those\r\nPlates, and so turn them into Looking-glasses, we Foliated a Plate of\r\n_Muscovy_ Glass, and then laying on it a little Transparent Varnish of a\r\nGold Colour, we expos'd it to the Sun-beams, so as to cast them upon a Body\r\nfit to receive them, on which the Reflected Light, appearing, as we\r\nexpected, Yellow, manifested that Rebounding from the Specular part of the\r\n_Selenitis_, it was Ting'd in its return with the Colour of the Transparent\r\nVarnish through which it pass'd.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XIV._\r\n\r\nAfter what we have said of the Composition of Colours, it will now be\r\nseasonable to annex some Experiments that we made in favour of those\r\nColours, that are taught in the Schools not to be Real, but only Apparent\r\nand Phantastical; For we found by Tryals, that these Colours might be\r\nCompounded, both with True and Stable Colours, and with one another, as\r\nwell as unquestionably Genuine and Lasting Colours, and that the Colours\r\nresulting from such Compositions, would respectively deserve the same\r\nDenominations.\r\n\r\nFor first, having by the Trajection of the Sun-beams through a Glass-prism\r\nthrown an Iris on the Floor, I found that by placing a Blew Glass at a\r\nconvenient distance betwixt the Prism and the Iris, that part of the Iris\r\nthat was before Yellow, might be made to appear Green, though not of a\r\nGrass Green, but of one more Dilute and Yellowish. And it seems not\r\nimprobable, that the narrow Greenish List (if I may so call it) that is\r\nwont to be seen between the Yellow and Blew parts of the Iris, is made by\r\nthe Confusion of those two Bordering Colours.\r\n\r\nNext, I found, that though the want of a sufficient Liveliness in either of\r\nthe Compounding Colours, or a light Error in the manner of making the\r\nfollowing Tryals, was enough to render some of them Unsuccessfull, yet when\r\nall necessary Circumstances were duely observ'd, the Event was answerable\r\nto our Expectation and Desire.\r\n\r\nAnd (as I formerly Noted) that Red and Blew compound a Purple, so I could\r\nproduce this last nam'd Colour, by casting at some Distance from the Glass\r\nthe Blew part of the Prismatical Iris (as I think it may be call'd for\r\nDistinction sake) upon a Lively Red, (for else the Experiment succeeds not\r\nso well.) And I remember, that sometimes when I try'd this upon a piece of\r\nRed Cloath, _that_ part of the Iris which would have been Blew, (as I try'd\r\nby covering that part of the Cloath with a piece of White Paper) and\r\nCompounded with the Red, wherewith the Cloath was Imbued before, appear'd\r\nof a fair Purple, did, when I came to View it near at hand, look very Odly,\r\nas if there were some strange Reflection or Refraction or both made in the\r\nHairs of which that Cloath was composed.\r\n\r\nCalling likewise the Prismatical Iris upon a very Vivid Blew, I found that\r\npart of it, which would else have been the Yellow, appear Green. (Another\r\nsomewhat differing Tryal, and yet fit to confirm this, you will find in the\r\nfifteenth Experiment.)\r\n\r\nBut it may seem somewhat more strange, that though the Prismatical Iris\r\nbeing made by the Refraction of Light through a Body that has no Colour at\r\nall, must according to the Doctrine of the Schools consist of as purely\r\nEmphatical Colours, as may be, yet even these may be Compounded with one\r\nanother, as well as Real Colours in the Grossest Pigments. For I took at\r\nonce two Triangular Glasses, and one of them being kept fixt in the same\r\nPosture, that the Iris it projected on the Floor might not Waver, I cast on\r\nthe same Floor another Iris with the other Prism, and Moving it too and fro\r\nto bring what part of the second Iris I pleas'd, to fall upon what part of\r\nthe first I thought fit, we did sometimes (for a small Errour suffices to\r\nhinder the Success) obtain by this means a Green Colour in that part of the\r\nmore Stable Iris, that before was Yellow, or Blew, and frequently by\r\ncasting those Beams that in one of the Iris's made the Blew upon the Red\r\nparts of the other Iris, we were able to produce a lovely Purple, which we\r\ncan Destroy or Recompose at pleasure, by Severing and Reapproaching the\r\nEdges of the two Iris's.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XV._\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, _Pyrophilus_, I shall add, that finding the Glass-prism\r\nto be the usefullest Instrument Men have yet imploy'd about the\r\nContemplation of Colours, and considering that Prisms hitherto in use are\r\nmade of Glass, Transparent and Colourless, I thought it would not be amiss\r\nto try, what change the Superinduction of a Colour, without the Destruction\r\nof the Diaphaneity, would produce in the Colours exhibited by the Prism.\r\nBut being unable to procure one to be made of Colour'd Glass, and fearing\r\nalso that if it were not carefully made, the Thickness of it would render\r\nit too Opacous, I endeavoured to substitute one made of Clarify'd Rosin, or\r\nof Turpentine brought (as I elsewhere teach) to the consistence of a\r\nTransparent Gum. But though these Endeavours were not wholly lost, yet we\r\nfound it so difficult to give these Materials their true Shape, that we\r\nchose rather to Varnish over an ordinary Prism with some of these few\r\nPigments that are to be had Transparent; as accordingly we did first with\r\nYellow, and then with Red, or rather Crimson, made with Lake temper'd with\r\na convenient Oyl, and the Event was, That for want of good Transparent\r\nColours, (of which you know there are but very few) both the Yellow and the\r\nRed made the Glass so Opacous, (though the Pigment were laid on but upon\r\ntwo Sides of the Glass, no more being absolutely necessary) that unless I\r\nlook'd upon an Inlightned Window, or the Flame of a Candle, or some other\r\nLuminous or very Vivid object, I could scarce discern any Colours at all,\r\nespecially when the Glass was cover'd with Red. But when I did look on such\r\nObjects, it appear'd (as I expected) that the Colour of the Pigment had\r\nVitiated or Drown'd some of those which the Prism would according to its\r\nwont have exhibited, and mingling with others, Alter'd them: as I remember,\r\nthat both to my Eyes, and others to whom I show'd it, when the Prism was\r\ncover'd with Yellow, it made those Parts of bright Objects, where the Blew\r\nwould else have been Conspicuous, appear of a light Green. But,\r\n_Pyrophilus_, both the Nature of the Colours, and the Degree of\r\nTransparency, or of Darkness in the Pigment, besides divers other\r\nCircumstances, did so vary the _Phænomena_ of these Tryals, that till I can\r\nprocure small Colour'd Prisms, or Hollow ones that may be filled with\r\nTincted Liquor, or obtain Some better Pigments than those I was reduc'd to\r\nimploy, I shall forbear to Build any thing upon what has been delivered,\r\nand shall make no other use of it, than to invite you to prosecute the\r\nInquiry further.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XVI._\r\n\r\nAnd here, _Pyrophilus_, since we are treating of Emphatical Colours, we\r\nshall add what we think not unworthy your Observation, and not unfit to\r\nafford some Exercise to the Speculative. For there are some Liquors, which\r\nthough Colourless themselves, when they come to be Elevated, and Dispers'd\r\ninto Exhalations, exhibit a conspicuous Colour, which they lose again, when\r\nthey come to be Reconjoyn'd into a Liquor, as good Spirit of _Nitre_; or\r\nupon its account strong _Aqua-fortis_, though devoid of all appearance of\r\nRedness whilst they continue in the form of a Liquor, if a little Heat\r\nchance to turn the Minute parts of them into Vapour, the Steam will appear\r\nof a Reddish or deep Yellow Colour, which will Vanish when those\r\nExhalations come to resume the form of Liquor.\r\n\r\nAnd not only if you look upon a Glass half full of _Aqua-fortis_, or Spirit\r\nof _Nitre_, and half full of _Nitrous_ steams proceeding from it, you will\r\nsee the Upper part of the Glass of the Colour freshly mention'd, if through\r\nit you look upon the Light. But which is much more considerable, I have\r\ntried, that putting _Aqua-fortis_ in a long clear Glass, and adding a\r\nlittle Copper or some such open Metall to it, to excite Heat and Fumes, the\r\nLight trajected through those Fumes, and cast upon a sheet of White Paper,\r\ndid upon that appear of the Colour that the Fumes did, when directly Look'd\r\nupon, as if the Light were as well Ting'd in its passage through these\r\nFumes, as it would have been by passing through some Glass or Liquor in\r\nwhich the same Colour was Inherent.\r\n\r\nTo which I shall further add, that having sometimes had the Curiosity to\r\nobserve whether the Beams of the Sun near the Horizon trajected through a\r\nvery Red Sky, would not (though such rednesses are taken to be but\r\nEmphatical Colours) exhibit the like Colour, I found that the Beams falling\r\nwithin a Room upon a very White Object, plac'd directly opposite to the\r\nSun, disclos'd a manifest Redness, as if they had pass'd through a Colour'd\r\n_Medium_.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XVII._\r\n\r\nThe emergency, _Pyrophilus_, of Colours upon the Coalition of the Particles\r\nof such Bodies as were neither of them of the Colour of that Mixture\r\nwhereof they are the Ingredients, is very well worth our attentive\r\nObservation, as being of good use both Speculative and Practical; For much\r\nof the Mechanical use of Colours among Painters and Dyers, doth depend upon\r\nthe Knowledge of what Colours may be produc'd by the Mixtures of Pigments\r\nso and so Colour'd. And (as we lately intimated) 'tis of advantage to the\r\ncontemplative Naturalist, to know how many and which Colours are Primitive\r\n(if I may so call them) and Simple, because it both eases his Labour by\r\nconfining his most sollicitous Enquiry to a small Number of Colours upon\r\nwhich the rest depend, and assists him to judge of the nature of particular\r\ncompounded Colours, by shewing him from the Mixture of what more Simple\r\nones, and of what Proportions of them to one another, the particular Colour\r\nto be consider'd does result. But because to insist on the Proportions, the\r\nManner and the Effects of such Mixtures would oblige me to consider a\r\ngreater part of the Painters Art and Dyers Trade, than I am well acquainted\r\nwith, I confin'd my self to make Trial of _several ways to produce Green_,\r\nby the composition of Blew and Yellow. And shall in this place both\r\nRecapitulate most of the things I have Dispersedly deliver'd already\r\nconcerning that Subject, and Recruit them.\r\n\r\nAnd first, whereas Painters (as I noted above) are wont to make Green by\r\ntempering Blew and Yellow, both of them made into a soft Consistence, with\r\neither Water or Oyl, or some Liquor of Kin to one of those two, according\r\nas the Picture is to be Drawn with those they call _water Colours_, or\r\nthose they term _Oyl Colours_, I found that by choosing fit Ingredients,\r\nand mixing them in the form of Dry Powders, I could do, what I could not if\r\nthe Ingredients were temper'd up with a Liquor; But the Blew and Yellow\r\nPowders must not only be finely Ground, but such as that the Corpuscles of\r\nthe one may not be too unequal to those of the other, lest by their\r\nDisproportionate Minuteness the Smaller cover and hide the Greater. We us'd\r\nwith good success a slight Mixture of the fine Powder of Bise, with that of\r\nOrpiment, or that of good Yellow Oker, I say a _slight_ Mixture, because we\r\nfound that an _exquisite_ Mixture did not do so well, but by lightly\r\nmingling the two Pigments in several little Parcels, those of them in which\r\nthe Proportion and Manner of Mixture was more Lucky, afforded us a good\r\nGreen.\r\n\r\n2. We also learn'd in the Dye-houses, that Cloth being Dy'd Blew with Woad,\r\nis afterwards by the Yellow Decoction of _Luteola_ or Woud-wax or Wood-wax\r\nDy'd into a Green Colour.\r\n\r\n3. You may also remember what we above Related, where we intimated, that\r\nhaving in a Darkn'd Room taken two Bodies, a Blew and a Yellow, and cast\r\nthe Light Reflected from the one upon the other, we likewise obtain'd a\r\nGreen.\r\n\r\n4. And you may remember, that we observ'd a Green to be produc'd, when in\r\nthe same Darkn'd Room we look'd at the Hole at which alone the Light\r\nenter'd, through the Green and Yellow parts of a sheet of Marbl'd Paper\r\nlaid over one another.\r\n\r\n5. We found too, that the Beams of the Sun being trajected through two\r\npieces of Glass, the one Blew and the other Yellow, laid over one another,\r\ndid upon a sheet of White paper on which they were made to fall, exhibit a\r\nlovely Green.\r\n\r\n6. I hope also, that you have not already forgot, what was so lately\r\ndeliver'd, concerning the composition of a Green, with a Blew and Yellow;\r\nof which most Authors would call the one a _Real_, and the other an\r\n_Emphatical_.\r\n\r\n7. And I presume, you may have yet fresh in your memory, what the\r\nfourteenth Experiment informs you, concerning the exhibiting of a Green, by\r\nthe help of a Blew and Yellow, that were both of them Emphatical.\r\n\r\n8. Wherefore we will proceed to take notice, that we also devis'd a way of\r\ntrying whether or no Metalline Solutions though one of them at least had\r\nits Colour Adventitious, by the mixture of the _Menstruum_ employ'd to\r\ndissolve it, might not be made to compound a Green after the manner of\r\nother Bodies. And though this seem'd not easie to be perform'd by reason of\r\nthe Difficulty of finding Metalline Solutions of the Colour requisite, that\r\nwould mix without Præcipitating each other; yet after a while having\r\nconsider'd the matter, the first Tryal afforded me the following\r\nExperiment. I took a High Yellow Solution of good Gold in _Aqua-Regis_,\r\n(made of _Aqua-fortis_, and as I remember half its weight of Spirit of\r\nSalt) To this I put a due Proportion of a deep and lovely Blew Solution of\r\nCrude Copper, (which I have elsewhere taught to be readily Dissoluble in\r\nstrong Spirit of Urine) and these two Liquors though at first they seem'd a\r\nlittle to Curdle one another, yet being throughly mingl'd by Shaking, they\r\npresently, as had been Conjectur'd, united into a Transparent Green Liquor,\r\nwhich continu'd so for divers days that I kept it in a small Glass wherein\r\n'twas made, only letting fall a little Blackish Powder to the Bottom. The\r\nother _Phænomena_ of this Experiment belong not to this place, where it may\r\nsuffice to take notice of the Production of a Green, and that the\r\nExperiment was more than once repeated with Success.\r\n\r\n9. And lastly, to try whether this way of compounding Colours would hold\r\nev'n in Ingredients actually melted by the Violence of the Fire, provided\r\ntheir Texture were capable of safely induring Fusion, we caus'd some Blew\r\nand Yellow Ammel to be long and well wrought together in the Flame of a\r\nLamp, which being Strongly and Incessantly blown on them kept them in some\r\ndegree of Fusion, and at length (for the Experiment requires some Patience\r\nas well as Skil) we obtain'd the expected Ammel of a Green Colour.\r\n\r\nI know not, _Pyrophilus_, whether it be worth while to acquaint you with\r\nthe ways that came into my Thoughts, whereby in some measure to explicate\r\nthe first of the mention'd ways of making a Green; for I have sometimes\r\nConjectur'd, that the mixture of the Bise and the Orpiment produc'd a Green\r\nby so altering the Superficial Asperity, which each of those Ingredients\r\nhad apart, that the Light Incident on the mixture was Reflected with\r\ndiffering Shades, as to Quantity, or Order, or both, from those of either\r\nof the Ingredients, and such as the Light is wont to be Modify'd with, when\r\nit Reflects from Grass, or Leaves, or some of those other Bodies that we\r\nare wont to call Green. And sometimes too I have doubted, whether the\r\nproduced Green might not be partly at least deriv'd from this, That the\r\nBeams that Rebound from the Corpuscles of the Orpiment, giving one kind of\r\nstroak upon the _Retina_, whose Perception we call Yellow, and the Beams\r\nReflected from the Corpuscles of the Bise, giving another stroak upon the\r\nsame _Retina_, like to Objects that are Blew, the Contiguity and Minuteness\r\nof these Corpuscles may make the Appulse of the Reflected Light fall upon\r\nthe _Retina_ within so narrow a Compass, that the part they Beat upon being\r\nbut as it were a Physical point, they may give a Compounded stroak, which\r\nmay consequently exhibit a Compounded and new Kind of Sensation, as we see\r\nthat two Strings of a Musical Instrument being struck together, making two\r\nNoises that arrive at the Ear at the same time as to Sense, yield a Sound\r\ndiffering from either of them, and as it were Compounded of both; Insomuch\r\nthat if they be Discordantly ton'd, though each of them struck apart would\r\nyield a Pleasing Sound, yet being struck together they make but a Harsh and\r\ntroublesome Noise. But this not being so fit a place to prosecute\r\nSpeculations, I shall not insist, neither upon these Conjectures nor any\r\nothers, which the Experiment we have been mentioning may have suggested to\r\nme. And I shall leave it to you, _Pyrophilus_, to derive what Instruction\r\nyou can from comparing together the Various ways whereby a Yellow and a\r\nBlew can be made to Compound a Green. That which I now pretend to, being\r\nonly to shew that the first of those mention'd ways, (not to take at\r\npresent notice of the rest) does far better agree with our Conjectures\r\nabout Colours, than either with the Doctrine of the Schools, or with that\r\nof the _Chymists_, both which seem to be very much Disfavour'd by it.\r\n\r\nFor first, since in the Mixture of the two mention'd Powders I could by the\r\nhelp of a very excellent _Microscope_ (for ordinary ones will scarce serve\r\nthe turn) discover that which seem'd to the naked Eye a Green Body, to be\r\nbut a heap of Distinct, though very small Grains of Yellow Orpiment and\r\nBlew Bise confusedly enough Blended together, it appears that the Colour'd\r\nCorpuscles of either kind did each retain its own Nature and Colour; By\r\nwhich it may be guess'd, what meer Transposition and Juxtaposition of\r\nMinute and Singly unchang'd Particles of Matter can do to produce a new\r\nColour; For that this Local Motion and new Disposition of the small parts\r\nof the Orpiment did Intervene is much more manifest than it is easie to\r\nExplicate how they should produce this new Green otherwise than by the new\r\nManner of their being put together, and consequently by their new\r\nDisposition to Modifie the Incident Light by Reflecting it otherwise than\r\nthey did before they were Mingl'd together.\r\n\r\nSecondly, The Green thus made being (if I may so speak) Mechanically\r\nproduc'd, there is no pretence to derive it from I know not what\r\nincomprehensible Substantial Form, from which yet many would have us\r\nbelieve that Colours must flow; Nor does this Green, though a Real and\r\nPermanent, not a Phantastical and Vanid Colour, seem to be such an Inherent\r\nQuality as they would have it, since not only each part of the Mixture\r\nremains unalter'd in Colour, and consequently of a differing Colour from\r\nthe Heap they Compose, but if the Eye be assisted by a _Microscope_ to\r\ndiscern things better and more distinctly than before it could, it sees not\r\na Green Body, but a Heap of Blew and Yellow Corpuscles.\r\n\r\nAnd in the third place, I demand what either Sulphur, or Salt, or Mercury\r\nhas to do in the Production of this Green; For neither the Bise nor the\r\nOrpiment were indu'd with that Colour before, and the bare Juxtaposition of\r\nthe Corpuscles of the two Powders that work not upon each other, but might\r\nif we had convenient Instruments be separated, unalter'd, cannot with any\r\nprobability be imagin'd either to Increase or Diminish any of the three\r\nHypostatical Principles, (to which of them soever the _Chymists_ are\r\npleas'd to ascribe Colours) nor does there here Intervene so much as Heat\r\nto afford them any colour to pretend, that at least there is made an\r\nExtraversion (as the _Helmontians_ speak) of the Sulphur or of any of the\r\ntwo other supposed Principles; But upon this Experiment we have already\r\nReflected enough, if not more than enough for once.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XVIII._\r\n\r\nBut here, _Pyrophilus_, I must advertise you, that 'tis not every Yellow\r\nand every Blew that being mingl'd will afford a Green; For in case one of\r\nthe Ingredients do not Act only as endow'd with such a Colour, but as\r\nhaving a power to alter the Texture of the Corpuscles of the other, so as\r\nto Indispose them to Reflect the Light, as Corpuscles that exhibit a Blew\r\nor a Yellow are wont to Reflect it, the emergent Colour may be not Green,\r\nbut such as the change of Texture in the Corpuscles of one or both of the\r\nIngredients qualifies them to shew forth; as for instance, if you let fall\r\na few Drops of Syrrup of Violets upon a piece of White Paper, though the\r\nSyrrup being spread will appear Blew, yet mingling with it two or three\r\nDrops of the lately mention'd Solution of Gold, I obtain'd not a Green but\r\na Reddish mixture, which I expected from the remaining Power of the Acid\r\nSalts abounding in the Solution, such Salts or Saline Spirits being wont,\r\nas we shall see anon, though weakn'd, so to work upon that Syrrup as to\r\nchange it into a Red or Reddish Colour. And to confirm that for which I\r\nallege the former Experiment, I shall add this other, that having made a\r\nvery strong and high-colour'd Solution of Filings of Copper with Spirit of\r\nUrine, though the _Menstruum_ seem'd Glutted with the Metall, because I put\r\nin so much Filings that many of them remain'd for divers days Undissolv'd\r\nat the Bottom, yet having put three or four Drops of Syrrup of Violets upon\r\nWhite Paper, I found that the deep Blew Solution proportionably mingl'd\r\nwith this other Blew Liquor did not make a Blew mixture, but, as I\r\nexpected, a fair Green, upon the account of the Urinous Salt that was in\r\nthe _Menstruum_.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XIX._\r\n\r\nTo shew the _Chymists_, that Colours may be made to Appear or Vanish, where\r\nthere intervenes no Accession or Change either of the Sulphureous, or the\r\nSaline, or the Mercurial principle (as they speak) of Bodies: I shall not\r\nmake use of the Iris afforded by the Glass-prism, nor of the Colours to be\r\nseen in a fair Morning in those drops of Dew that do in a convenient manner\r\nReflect and Refract the Beams of Light to the Eye; But I will rather mind\r\nthem of what they may observe in their own Laboratories, namely, that\r\ndivers, if not all, Chymical Essential Oyls, as also good Spirit of Wine,\r\nbeing shaken till they have good store of Bubbles, those Bubbles will (if\r\nattentively consider'd) appear adorn'd with various and lovely Colours,\r\nwhich all immediately Vanish, upon the relapsing of the Liquor that affords\r\nthose Bubbles their Skins, into the rest of the Oyl, or Spirit of Wine, so\r\nthat a Colourless Liquor may be made in a trice to exhibit variety of\r\nColours, and may lose them in a moment without the Accession or Diminution\r\nof any of its Hypostatical Principles. And, by the way, 'tis not unworthy\r\nour notice, that some Bodies, as well Colourless, as Colour'd, by being\r\nbrought to a great Thinness of parts, acquire Colours though they had none\r\nbefore, or Colours differing from them they were before endued with: For,\r\nnot to insist on the Variety of Colours, that Water, made somewhat\r\nGlutinous by Sope, acquires, when 'tis blown into such Sphærical Bubbles as\r\nBoys are wont to make and play with; Turpentine (though it have a Colour\r\ndeep enough of its own) may (by being blown into after a certain manner) be\r\nbrought to afford Bubbles adorn'd with variety of Orient Colours, which\r\nthough they Vanish after some while upon the breaking of the Bubbles, yet\r\nthey would in likelihood always exhibit Colours upon their _Superfices_,\r\n(though not always the same in the same Parts of them, but Vary'd according\r\nto the Incidence of the Sight, and the Position of the Eye) if their\r\nTexture were durable enough: For I have seen one that was Skill'd at\r\nfashioning Glasses by the help of a Lamp, blowing some of them so strongly\r\nas to burst them, whereupon it was found, that the Tenacity of the Metall\r\nwas such, that before it broke it suffer'd it self to be reduc'd into Films\r\nso extremely thin, that being kept clean they constantly shew'd on their\r\nSurfaces (but after the manner newly mention'd) the varying Colours of the\r\nRain-bow, which were exceedingly Vivid, as I had often opportunity to\r\nobserve in some, that I caus'd purposely to be made, to keep by me.\r\n\r\nBut lest it should be objected, that the above mentioned Instances are\r\ndrawn from Transparent Liquors, it may possibly appear, not impertinent to\r\nadd, what I have sometimes thought upon, and several times tried, when I\r\nwas considering the Opinions of the _Chymists_ about Colours, I took then a\r\nFeather of a convenient Bigness and Shape, and holding it at a fit distance\r\nbetwixt my Eye and the Sun when he was near the Horizon, me thought there\r\nappear'd to me a Variety of little Rain-bows, with differing and very vivid\r\nColours, of which none was constantly to be seen in the Feather; the like\r\n_Phænomenon_ I have at other times (though not with altogether so good\r\nsuccess) produc'd, by interposing at a due distance a piece of Black\r\nRibband betwixt the almost setting Sun and my Eye, not to mention the\r\nTrials I have made to the same purpose, with other Bodies.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XX._\r\n\r\nTake good Syrrup of Violets, Imprægnated with the Tincture of the flowers,\r\ndrop a little of it upon a White Paper (for by that means the Change of\r\nColour will be more conspicuous, and the Experiment may be practis'd in\r\nsmaller Quantities) and on this Liquor let fall two or three drops of\r\nSpirit either of Salt or Vinegar, or almost any other eminently Acid\r\nLiquor, and upon the Mixture of these you shall find the Syrrup immediatly\r\nturn'd Red, and the way of Effecting such a Change has not been unknown to\r\ndivers Persons who have produc'd the like, by Spirit of Vitriol, or juice\r\nof Limmons, but have Groundlessly ascrib'd the Effect to some Peculiar\r\nQuality of those two Liquors, whereas, (as we have already intimated)\r\nalmost any Acid Salt will turn Syrrup of Violets Red. But to improve the\r\nExperiment, let me add what has not (that I know of) been hitherto\r\nobserv'd, and has, when we first shew'd it them, appear'd something\r\nstrange, even to those that have been inquisitive into the Nature of\r\nColours; namely, that if instead of Spirit of Salt, or that of Vinegar, you\r\ndrop upon the Syrrup of Violets a little Oyl of Tartar _per Deliquium_, or\r\nthe like quantity of Solution of Potashes, and rubb them together with your\r\nfinger, you shall find the Blew Colour of the Syrrup turn'd in a moment\r\ninto a perfect Green, and the like may be perform'd by divers other\r\nLiquors, as we may have occasion elsewhere to Inform you.\r\n\r\n_Annotation upon the twentieth Experiment_.\r\n\r\nThe use of what we lately deliver'd concerning the way of turning Syrrup of\r\nViolets, Red or Green, may be this; That, though it be a far more common\r\nand procurable Liquor than the Infusion of _Lignum Nephriticum_, it may yet\r\nbe easily substituted in its Room, when we have a mind to examine, whether\r\nor no the Salt predominant in a Liquor or other Body, wherein 'tis Loose\r\nand Abundant, belong to the Tribe of _Acid_ Salts or not. For if such a\r\nBody turn the Syrrup of a Red or Reddish Purple Colour, it does for the\r\nmost part argue the Body (especially if it be a distill'd Liquor) to abound\r\nwith Acid Salt. But if the Syrrup be made Green, that argues the\r\nPredominant Salt to be of a Nature repugnant to that of the Tribe of Acids.\r\nFor, as I find that either Spirit of Salt, or Oyl of Vitriol, or\r\n_Aqua-fortis_, or Spirit of Vinegar, or Juice of Lemmons, or any of the\r\nAcid Liquors I have yet had occasion to try, will turn Syrrup of Violets,\r\nof a _Red_, (or at least, of a _Reddish_ Colour, so I have found, that not\r\nonly the Volatile Salts of all Animal Substances I have us'd, as Spirit of\r\nHarts-horn, of Urine, of Sal-Armoniack, of Blood, &c. but also all the\r\nAlcalizate Salts I have imploy'd, as the Solution of Salt of Tartar, of\r\nPot-ashes, of common Wood-ashes, Lime-water, &c. will immediately change\r\nthe Blew Syrrup, into a perfect Green. And by the same way (to hint that\r\nupon the by) I elsewhere show you, both the changes that Nature and Time\r\nproduce, in the more Saline parts of some Bodies, may be discover'd, and\r\nalso how ev'n such Chymically prepar'd Bodies, as belong not either to the\r\nAnimal Kingdome, or to the Tribe of _Alcali's_, may have their new and\r\nsuperinduc'd Nature successfully Examin'd. In this place I shall only add,\r\nthat not alone the Changing the Colour of the Syrrup, requires, that the\r\nChanging Body be more strong, of the Acid, or other sort of Salt that is\r\nPredominant in it, than is requisite for the working upon the Tincture of\r\n_Lignum Nephriticum_; but that in this is also, the Operation of the\r\nformerly mention'd Salts upon our Syrrup, differs from their Operation upon\r\nour Tinctures, that in this Liquor, if the Cæruleous Colour be _Destroy'd_\r\nby an Acid Salt, it may be _Restor'd_ by one that is either Volatile, or\r\nLixiviate; whereas in Syrrup of Violets, though one of these contrary Salts\r\nwill _destroy_ the Action of the other, yet neither of them will _restore_\r\nthe Syrrup to its native Blew; but each of them will Change it into the\r\nColour which it self doth (if I may so speak) affect, as we shall have\r\nOccasion to show in the Notes on the twenty fifth Experiment.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXI._\r\n\r\nThere is a Weed, more known to Plowmen than belov'd by them, whose Flowers\r\nfrom their Colour are commonly call'd _Blew-bottles_, and _Corn-weed_ from\r\ntheir Growing among Corn[18]. These Flowers some Ladies do, upon the\r\naccount of their Lovely Colour, think worth the being Candied, which when\r\nthey are, they will long retain so fair a Colour, as makes them a very fine\r\nSallad in the Winter. But I have try'd, that when they are freshly\r\ngather'd, they will afford a Juice, which when newly express'd, (for in\r\nsome cases 'twill soon enough degenerate) affords a very deep and pleasant\r\nBlew. Now, (to draw this to our present Scope) by dropping on this fresh\r\nJuice, a little Spirit of Salt, (that being the Acid Spirit I had then at\r\nhand) it immediately turn'd (as I predicted) into a Red. And if instead of\r\nthe Sowr Spirit I mingled with it a little strong Solution of an Alcalizate\r\nSalt, it did presently disclose a lovely Green; the same Changes being by\r\nthose differing sorts of Saline Liquors, producible in this _Natural\r\njuice_, that we lately mention'd to have happen'd to that _factitious\r\nMixture_, the Syrrup of Violets. And I remember, that finding this Blew\r\nLiquor, when freshly made, to be capable of serving in a Pen for an Ink of\r\nthat Colour, I attempted by moistning one part of a piece of White Paper\r\nwith the Spirit of Salt I have been mentioning, and another with some\r\nAlcalizate or Volatile Liquor, to draw a Line on the leisurely dry'd Paper,\r\nthat should, e'vn before the Ink was dry, appear partly Blew, partly Red,\r\nand partly Green: But though the latter part of the Experiment succeeded\r\nnot well, (whether because Volatile Salts are too Fugitive to be retain'd\r\nin the Paper, and Alcalizate ones are too Unctuous, or so apt to draw\r\nMoisture from the Air, that they keep the Paper from drying well) yet the\r\nformer Part succeeded well enough; the Blew and Red being Conspicuous\r\nenough to afford a surprizing Spectacle to those, I acquaint not with (what\r\nI willingly allow you to call) the _Trick_.\r\n\r\n  [18] _Herbarists_ are wont to call this Plant _Cyanus vulgaris minor_.\r\n\r\n_Annotation upon the one and twentieth Experiment._\r\n\r\nBut lest you should be tempted to think (_Pyrophilus_) that Volatile or\r\nAlcalizate Salts change Blews into Green, rather upon the score of the\r\neasie Transition of the former Colour into the latter, than upon the\r\naccount of the Texture, wherein most Vegetables, that afford a Blew, seem,\r\nthough otherwise differing, to be Allied, I will add, that when I purposely\r\ndissolv'd Blew Vitriol in fair Water, and thereby imbu'd sufficiently that\r\nLiquor with that Colour, a Lixiviate Liquor, and a Urinous Salt being\r\nCopiously pour'd upon distinct Parcels of it, did each of them, though\r\nperhaps with some Difference, turn the Liquor not Green, but of a deep\r\nYellowish Colour, almost like that of Yellow Oker, which Colour the\r\nPrecipitated Corpuscles retain'd, when they had Leisurely subsided to the\r\nBottom. What this Precipitated Substance is, it is not needfull now to\r\nEnquire in this place, and in another, I have shown you, that\r\nnotwithstanding its Colour, and its being Obtainable from an Acid\r\n_Menstruum_ by the help of Salt of Tartar, it is yet far enough from being\r\nthe true Sulphur of Vitriol.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXII._\r\n\r\nOur next Experiment (_Pyrophilus_) will perhaps seem to be of a contrary\r\nNature to the two former, made upon Syrrup of Violets, and Juice of\r\nBlew-bottles. For as in them by the Affusion of Oyl of Tartar, a Blewish\r\nLiquor is made Green, so in this, by the sole Mixture of the same Oyl, a\r\nGreenish Liquor becomes Blew. The hint of this Experiment was given us by\r\nthe practice of some _Italian_ Painters, who being wont to Counterfeit\r\n_Ultra-marine Azure_ (as they call it) by Grinding Verdigrease with\r\nSal-Armoniack, and some other Saline Ingredients, and letting them Rot (as\r\nthey imagine) for a good while together in a Dunghill, we suppos'd, that\r\nthe change of Colour wrought in the Verdigrease by this way of Preparation,\r\nmust proceed from the Action of certain Volatile and Alcalizate Salts,\r\nabounding in some of the mingled Concretes, and brought to make a further\r\nDissolution of the Copper abounding in the Verdigrease, and therefore we\r\nConjectur'd, that if both the Verdigrease, and such Salts were dissolv'd in\r\nfair Water, the small Parts of both being therein more subdivided, and set\r\nat liberty, would have better access to each other, and thereby Incorporate\r\nmuch the more suddenly; And accordingly we found, that if upon a strong\r\nSolution of good French Verdigrease (for 'tis that we are wont to imploy,\r\nas the best) you pour a just quantity of Oyl of Tartar, and shake them well\r\ntogether, you shall immediately see a notable Change of Colour, and the\r\nMixture will grow thick, and not transparent, but if you stay a while, till\r\nthe Grosser part be Precipitated to, and setled in the Bottom, you may\r\nobtain a clear Liquor of a very lovely Colour, and exceeding delightfull to\r\nthe Eye. But, you must have a care to drop in a competent Quantity of Oyl\r\nof Tartar, for else the Colour will not be so Deep, and Rich; and if\r\ninstead of this Oyl you imploy a clear _Lixivium_ of Pot-ashes, you may\r\nhave an Azure somewhat Lighter or Paler than, and therefore differing from,\r\nthe former. And if instead of either of these Liquors, you make use of\r\nSpirit of Urine, or of Harts-horn, you may according to the Quantity and\r\nQuality of the Spirit you pour in, obtain some further Variety (though\r\nscarce considerable) of Cæruleous Liquors. And yet lately by the help of\r\nthis Urinous Spirit we made a Blew Liquor, which not a few Ingenious\r\nPersons, and among them, some, whose Profession makes them very Conversant\r\nwith Colours, have looked upon with some wonder. But these Azure Colour'd\r\nLiquors should be freed from the Subsiding matter, which the Salts of\r\nTartar or Urine precipitate out of them, rather by being Decanted, than by\r\nFiltration. For by the latter of these ways we have sometimes found, the\r\nColour of them very much Impair'd, and little Superiour to that of the\r\ngrosser Substance, that it left in the Filtre.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXIII._\r\n\r\nThat Roses held over the Fume of Sulphur, may quickly by it be depriv'd of\r\ntheir Colour, and have as much of their Leaves, as the Fume works upon,\r\nburn'd pale, is an Experiment, that divers others have tried, as well as I.\r\nBut (_Pyrophilus_) it may seem somewhat strange to one that has never\r\nconsider'd the Compounded nature of Brimstone, That, whereas the Fume of\r\nSulphur will, as we have said, Whiten the Leaves of Roses; That Liquor,\r\nwhich is commonly call'd Oyl of Sulphur _per Campanam_, because it is\r\nsuppos'd to be made by the Condensation of these Fumes in Glasses shap't\r\nlike Bells, into a Liquor, does powerfully heighten the Tincture of Red\r\nRoses, and make it more Red and Vivid, as we have easily tried by putting\r\nsome Red-Rose Leaves, that had been long dried, (and so had lost much of\r\ntheir Colour) into a Vial of fair Water. For a while after the Affusion of\r\na convenient Quantity of the Liquor we are speaking of, both the Leaves\r\nthemselves, and the Water they were Steep'd in, discover'd a very fresh and\r\nlovely Colour.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXIV._\r\n\r\nIt may (_Pyrophilus_) somewhat serve to Illustrate, not only the Doctrine\r\nof _Pigments_, and of _Colours_, but divers other Parts of the _Corpuscular\r\nPhilosophy_; as that explicates Odours, and many other things, not as the\r\nSchools by Aery Qualities, but by Real, though extremely Minute Bodies; to\r\nexamine, how much of a Colourless Liquor, a very small Parcel of a Pigment\r\nmay Imbue with a _discernable_ Colour. And though there be scarce any thing\r\nof Preciseness to be expected from such Trials, yet I presum'd, that (at\r\nleast) I should be able to show a much further Subdivision of the Parts of\r\nMatter into _Visible_ Particles, than I have hitherto found taken notice\r\nof, and than most men would imagine; no Body, that I know of, having yet\r\nattempted to reduce this Matter to any Measure.\r\n\r\nThe Bodies, the most promising for such a purpose, might seem to be the\r\nMetalls, especially Gold, because of the Multitude, and Minuteness of its\r\nParts, which might be argu'd from the incomparable Closeness of its\r\nTexture: But though we tried a Solution of Gold made in _Aqua Regia_ first,\r\nand then in fair Water; yet in regard we were to determine the Pigment we\r\nimploy'd, not by _Bulk_ but _Weight_, and because also, that the Yellow\r\nColour of Gold is but a faint one in Comparison of the deep Colour of\r\n_Cochineel_, we rather chose this to make our Trials with. But among divers\r\nof these it will suffice to set down one, which was carefully made in\r\nVessels conveniently Shap'd; (and that in the presence of a Witness, and an\r\nAssistant) the Sum whereof I find among my _Adversaria_, Registred in the\r\nfollowing Words. To which I shall only premise, (to lessen the wonder of so\r\nstrange a diffusion of the Pigment) That _Cochineel_ will be better\r\nDissolv'd, and have its Colour far more heightn'd by Spirit of Urine, than\r\n(I say not by common Water, but) by Rectify'd Spirit of Wine it self.\r\n\r\nThe Note I spoke off is this. [One Grain of _Cochineel_ dissolv'd in a\r\npretty Quantity of Spirit of Urine, and then dissolv'd further by degrees\r\nin fair Water, imparted a discernable, though but a very faint Colour, to\r\nabout six Glass-fulls of Water, each of them containing about forty three\r\nOunces and an half, which amounts to above a hundred twenty five thousand\r\ntimes its own Weight.]\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXV._\r\n\r\nIt may afford a considerable Hint (_Pyrophilus_) to him, that would improve\r\nthe Art of Dying, to know what change of Colours may be produc'd by the\r\nthree several sorts of Salts already often mention'd, (some or other of\r\nwhich may be procur'd in Quantity at reasonable Rates) in the Juices,\r\nDecoctions, Infusions, and (in a word) the more soluble parts of\r\nVegetables. And, though the design of this Discourse be the Improvement of\r\nKnowledge, not of Trades: yet thus much I shall not scruple to intimate\r\nhere, That the Blew Liquors, mention'd in the twentieth and one and\r\ntwentieth Experiments, are far from being the only Vegetable Substances,\r\nupon which Acid, Urinous, and Alcalizate Salts have the like Operations to\r\nthose recited in those two Experiments. For Ripe _Privet Berries_ (for\r\ninstance) being crush'd upon White Paper, though they stain it with a\r\nPurplish Colour, yet if we let fall on some part of it two or three drops\r\nof Spirit of Salt, and on the other part a little more of the Strong\r\nSolution of Pot-ashes, the former Liquor immediately turn'd that part of\r\nthe Thick juice or Pulp, on which it fell, into a lovely Red, and the\r\nlatter turn'd the other part of it into a delightfull Green. Though I will\r\nnot undertake, that those Colours in that Substance shall not be much more\r\nOrient, than Lasting; and though (_Pyrophilus_) this Experiment may seem to\r\nbe almost the same with those already deliver'd concerning Syrrup of\r\nViolets, and the Juice of Blew-bottles, yet I think it not amiss to take\r\nthis Occasion to inform you, that this Experiment reaches much farther,\r\nthan perhaps you yet imagine, and may be of good Use to those, whom it\r\nconcerns to know, how Dying Stuffs may be wrought upon by Saline Liquors.\r\nFor, I have found this Experiment to succeed in so many Various Berries,\r\nFlowers, Blossoms, and other finer Parts of Vegetables, that neither my\r\nMemory, nor my Leisure serves me to enumerate them. And it is somewhat\r\nsurprizing to see, by how Differingly-colour'd Flowers, or Blossoms, (for\r\nexample) the Paper being stain'd, will by an Acid Spirit be immediately\r\nturn'd Red, and by any _Alcaly_ or any Urinous Spirit turn'd Green;\r\ninsomuch that ev'n the crush'd Blossoms of _Meserion_, (which I gather'd in\r\nWinter and frosty Weather) and those of Pease, crush'd upon White Paper,\r\nhow remote soever their Colours be from Green, would in a moment pass into\r\na deep Degree of that Colour, upon the Touch of an Alcalizate Liquor. To\r\nwhich let us add, That either of those new Pigments (if I may so call them)\r\nmay by the Affusion of enough of a contrary Liquor, be presently chang'd\r\nfrom Red into Green, and from Green into Red, which Observation will hold\r\nalso in Syrrup of Violets, Juices of Blew-bottles, &c.\r\n\r\n_Annotation._\r\n\r\nAfter what I have formerly deliver'd to evince, That there are many\r\nInstances, wherein new Colours are produc'd or acquir'd by Bodies, which\r\n_Chymists_ are wont to think destitute of Salt, or to whose change of\r\nColours no new Accession of Saline Particles does appear to contribute, I\r\nthink we may safely enough acknowledge, that we have taken notice of so\r\nmany Changes made by the Intervention of Salts in the Colours of Mix'd\r\nBodies, that it has lessen'd our Wonder, That though _many Chymists_ are\r\nwont to ascribe the Colours of Such Bodies to their Sulphureous, and _the\r\nrest_ to their Mercurial Principle; yet _Paracelsus_ himself directs us in\r\nthe Indagation of Colours, to have an Eye principally upon Salts, as we\r\nfind in that passage of his, wherein he takes upon him to Oblige his\r\nReaders much by Instructing them, of what things they are to expect the\r\nKnowledge from each of the three distinct Principles of Bodies. _Alias_\r\n(says he) _Colorum similis ratio est: De quibus brevem institutionem hanc\r\nattendite, quod scilicet colores omnes ex Sale prodeant. Sal enim dat\r\ncolorem, dat Balsamum._[19] And a little beneath. _Iam natura Ipsa colores\r\nprotrathit ex sale, cuique speciei dans illum, qui ipsi competit_, &c.\r\nAfter which he concludes; _Itaque qui rerum omnium corpora cognoscere vult,\r\nhuic opus est, ut ante omnia cognoscat Sulphur, Ab hoc, qui desiderat\r\nnovisse Colores is scientiam istorum petat à Sale, Qui scire vult Virtutes,\r\nis scrutetur arcana Mercurii. Sic nimirum fundamentum hauserit Mysteriorum,\r\nin quolibet crescenti indagandorum, prout natura cuilibet speciei ea\r\ningessit_. But though _Paracelsus_ ascribes to each of his belov'd\r\nHypostatical Principles, much more than I fear will be found to belong to\r\nit; yet if we please to consider Colours, not as _Philosophers_, but as\r\n_Dyers_, the concurrence of Salts to the striking and change of Colours,\r\nand their Efficacy, will, I suppose, appear so considerable, that we shall\r\nnot need to quarrel much with _Paracelsus_, for ascribing in this place\r\n(for I dare not affirm that he uses to be still of one Mind) the Colours of\r\nBodies to their Salts, if by Salts he here understood, not only Elementary\r\nSalts, but such also as are commonly taken for Salts, as Allom, Crystals of\r\nTartar, Vitriol, &c. because the Saline principle does chiefly abound in\r\nthem, though indeed they be, as we elsewhere declare, mix'd Bodies, and\r\nhave most of them, besides what is Saline, both Sulphureous, Aqueous, and\r\nGross or Earthy parts.\r\n\r\n  [19] Paracelsus de Mineral. tract. 1. pag. m. 243\r\n\r\nBut though (_Pyrophilus_) I have observ'd a Red and Green to be produc'd,\r\nthe former, by Acid Salts, the later by Salts not Acid, in the express\r\nJuices of so many differing Vegetable Substances, that the Observation, if\r\npersued, may prove (as I said) of good Use: yet to show you how much e'vn\r\nthese Effects depend upon the particular Texture of Bodies, I must subjoyn\r\nsome cases wherein I (who am somewhat backwards to admit Observations for\r\nUniversal) had the Curiosity to discover, that the Experiments would not\r\nUniformly succeed, and of these Exceptions, the chief that I now remember,\r\nare reducible to the following three.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXVI._\r\n\r\nAnd, (first) I thought fit to try the Operation of Acid Salts upon\r\nVegetable Substances, that are already and by their own Nature Red. And\r\naccordingly I made Trial upon Syrrup of Clove-july-flowers, the clear\r\nexpress'd Juice of the succulent Berries of _Spina Cervina_, or Buckthorn\r\n(which I had long kept by me for the sake of its deep Colour) upon Red\r\nRoses, Infusion of Brazil, and divers other Vegetable Substances, on some\r\nof which crush'd (as is often mention'd) upon White Paper, (which is also\r\nto be understood in most of these Experiments, if no Circumstance of them\r\nargue otherwise) Spirit of Salt either made no considerable Change, or\r\nalter'd the Colour but from a Darker to a Lighter Red. How it will succeed\r\nin many other Vegetable Juices, and Infusions of the same Colour, I have at\r\npresent so few at hand, that I must leave you to find it out your self. But\r\nas for the Operation of the other sorts of Salts upon these Red Substances,\r\nI found it not very Uniform, some Red, or Reddish Infusions, as of Roses,\r\nbeing turn'd thereby into a dirty Colour, but yet inclining to Green. Nor\r\nwas the Syrrup of Clove-july-flowers turn'd by the solution of Pot-ashes to\r\na much better, though somewhat a Greener, Colour. Another sort of Red\r\nInfusions was by an _Alcaly_ not turn'd into a Green, but advanc'd into a\r\nCrimson, as I shall have occasion to note ere long. But there were other\r\nsorts, as particularly the lovely Colour'd juice of Buckthorn Berries, that\r\nreadily pass'd into a lovely Green.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXVII._\r\n\r\nAmong other Vegetables, which we thought likely to afford Exceptions to the\r\nGeneral Observation about the differing Changes of Colours produc'd by Acid\r\nand Sulphureous Salts, we thought fit to make Trial upon the Flowers of\r\n_Jasmin_, they being both White as to Colour, and esteem'd to be of a more\r\nOyly nature than other Flowers. Whereupon having taken the White parts only\r\nof the Flowers, and rubb'd them somewhat hard with my Finger upon a piece\r\nof clean Paper, it appear'd very little Discolour'd. Nor had Spirit of\r\nSalt, wherewith I moisten'd one part of it, any considerable Operation upon\r\nit. But Spirit of Urine, and somewhat more effectually a strong Alcalizate\r\nSolution, did immediately turn the almost Colourless Paper moisten'd by the\r\nJuice of the _Jasmin_, not as those Liquors are wont to do, when put upon\r\nthe Juices of other Flowers, of a good Green, but of a Deep, though\r\nsomewhat Greenish Yellow, which Experiment I did afterwards at several\r\ntimes repeat with the like success. But it seems not that a great degree of\r\nUnctuousness is necessary to the Production of the like Effects, for when\r\nwe try'd the Experiment with the Leaves of those purely White Flowers that\r\nappear about the end of Winter, and are commonly call'd _Snow drops_, the\r\nevent, was not much unlike that, which, we have been newly mentioning.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXVIII._\r\n\r\nAnother sort of Instances to show, how much changes of Colour effected by\r\nSalts, depend upon the particular Texture of the Colour'd Bodies, has been\r\nafforded me by several _Yellow_ Flowers, and other Vegetables, as Mary-gold\r\nLeaves, early Prim-roses, fresh Madder, &c. For being rubb'd upon White\r\nPaper, till they imbued it with their Colour, I found not, that by the\r\naddition of Alcalizate Liquors, nor yet by that of an Urinous Spirit, they\r\nwould be turn'd either Green or Red: nor did so Acid a Spirit, as that of\r\nSalt, considerably alter their Colour, save that it seem'd a little to\r\nDilute it. Only in some early Prim-roses it destroy'd the greatest part of\r\nthe Colour, and made the Paper almost White agen. And Madder also afforded\r\nsome thing peculiar, and very differing from what we have newly mention'd:\r\nFor having gather'd Some Roots of it, and, (whilst they were recent)\r\nexpress'd upon White Paper the Yellow Juice, an Alcalizate Solution drop'd\r\nupon it did not turn it either Green or White, but Red. And the bruis'd\r\nMadder it self being drench'd with the like Alcalizate Solution, exchang'd\r\nalso its Yellowishness for a Redness.\r\n\r\n_An admonition touching the four preceding Experiments._\r\n\r\nHaving thus (_Pyrophilus_) given you divers Instances, to countenance the\r\nGeneral observation deliver'd in the twenty fifth Experiment, and divers\r\nExceptions whereby it ought to be Limited; I must leave the further Inquiry\r\ninto these Matters to your own Industry. For not remembring at present many\r\nof those other Trials, long since made to satisfie my self about\r\nParticulars, and not having now the Opportunity to repeat them, I must\r\ncontent my Self to have given you the Hint, and the ways of prosecuting the\r\nsearch your Self; and only declare to you in general, that, As I have made\r\nmany Trials, unmention'd in this Treatise, whose Events were agreeable to\r\nthose mention'd in the twenty fifth Experiment, so (to name now no other\r\nInstances) what I have try'd with Acid and Sulphureous Salts upon the Pulp\r\nof Juniper Berries, rubb'd upon White Paper, inclines me to think, That\r\namong that vast Multitude, and strange Variety of Plants that adorn the\r\nface of the Earth, perhaps many other Vegetables may be found, on which\r\nsuch _Menstruums_ may not have such Operations, as upon the Juice of\r\nViolets, Pease-blossoms, &c. no nor upon any of those three other sorts of\r\nVegetables, that I have taken notice of in the three fore-going\r\nExperiments. It sufficiently appearing ev'n by these, that the effects of a\r\nSalt upon the Juices of particular Vegetables do very much depend upon\r\ntheir particular Textures.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXIX._\r\n\r\nIt may be of some Use towards the discovery of the nature of these Changes,\r\nwhich the Alimental Juice receives in some Vegetables, according to the\r\ndiffering degrees of their Maturity, and according to the differing kinds\r\nof Plants of the same Denomination, to observe what Operation Acid,\r\nUrinous, and Alcalizate Salts will have upon the Juices of the several\r\nsorts of the Vegetable substances I have been mentioning.\r\n\r\nTo declare my meaning by an Example, I took from the same Cluster, one\r\nBlackberry full Ripe, and another that had not yet gone beyond a Redness,\r\nand rubbing apiece of white Paper, with the former, I observ'd, that the\r\nJuice adhering to it was of adark Reddish Colour, full of little Black\r\nSpecks; and that this Juice by a drop of a strong _Lixivium_, was\r\nimmediately turn'd into a Greenish Colour deep enough, by as much Urinous\r\nSpirit into a Colour much of Kin to the former, though somewhat differing,\r\nand fainter; and by a drop of Spirit of Salt into a fine and lightsome Red:\r\nwhere as the Red Berry being in like manner rubb'd upon Paper, left on it a\r\nRed Colour, which was very little alter'd by the Acid Spirit newly nam'd,\r\nand by the Urinous and Lixiviate Salts receiv'd changes of Colour differing\r\nfrom those that had been just before produc'd in the dark Juice of the Ripe\r\nBlackberry.\r\n\r\nI remember also, that though the Infusion of Damask-Roses would as well,\r\nthough not so much, as that of Red, be heightned by Acid Spirits to an\r\nintense degree of Redness, and by Lixiviate Salts be brought to a Darkish\r\nGreen; yet having for Trials sake taken a Rose, whose Leaves, which were\r\nlarge and numerous, like those of a Province Rose, were perfectly Yellow,\r\nthough in a Solution of Salt of Tartar, they afforded a Green Blewish\r\nTincture, yet I did not by an Acid Liquor obtain a Red one; all that the\r\nSaline Spirit I imploy'd, perform'd, being (if I much misremember not) to\r\nDilute Somewhat the Yellowness of the Leaves. I would also have tried the\r\nTincture of Yellow Violets, but could procure none. And if I were in those\r\nIslands of _Banda_, which are made Famous as well as Rich, by being the\r\nalmost only places, where Cloves will prosper, I should think it worth my\r\nCuriosity to try, what Operation the three differing Kinds of Salts, I have\r\nso often mention'd, would have upon the Juice of this Spice, (express'd at\r\nthe several Seasons of it) as it grows upon the Tree. Since good Authors\r\ninform us, (of what is remarkable) that these whether Fruits, or Rudiments\r\nof Fruits, are at first _White_, afterward _Green_, and then _Reddish_,\r\nbefore they be beaten off the Tree, after which being Dry'd before they are\r\nput up, they grow _Blackish_ as we see them. And one of the recentest\r\n_Herbarists_ informs us, that the Flower grows upon the top of the Clove it\r\nself, consisting of four small Leaves, like a Cherry Blossom, but of an\r\nexcellent _Blew_. But (_Pyrophilus_) to return to our own Observations, I\r\nshall add, that I the rather choose, to mention to you an Example drawn\r\nfrom Roses, because that though I am apt to think, as I elsewhere\r\nadvertise, that something may be guess'd at about some of the Qualities of\r\nthe Juices of Vegetables, by the Resemblance or Disparity that we meet with\r\nin the Changes made of their Colours, by the Operation of the same kinds of\r\nSalts; yet that those Conjectures should be very warily made, may appear\r\namong other things, by the Instance I have chosen to give in Roses. For\r\nthough, (as I formerly told you) the Dry'd Leaves, both of the Damask, and\r\nof Red ones, give a Red Tincture to Water sharpen'd with Acid Salts, yet\r\nthe one sort of Leaves is known to have a Purgative faculty,[20] and the\r\nother are often, and divers ways, imploy'd for Binding.\r\n\r\n  [20] See _Parkinson_ Th. Boran. Trib. 9. cap. 26.\r\n\r\nAnd I also choose (_Pyrophilus_) to subjoyn this twenty ninth Experiment to\r\nthose that precede it, about the change of the Colours of Vegetables by\r\nSalts, for these two reasons: The first, that you may not easily entertain\r\nSuspitions, if in the Trials of an Experiment of some of the Kinds formerly\r\nmention'd, you should meet with an Event somewhat differing from what my\r\nRelations may have made you expect. And the second, That you may hereby be\r\ninvited to discern, that it may not be amiss to take notice of the\r\nparticular Seasons wherein you gather the Vegetables which in Nicer\r\nExperiments you make use of. For, it I were not hindred both by haste and\r\nsome justifiable Considerations, I could perhaps add considerable\r\nInstances, to those lately deliver'd, for the making out of this\r\nObservation; but for certain reasons I shall at present substitute a\r\nremarkable passage to be met with in that Laborious Herbarist Mr.\r\n_Parkinson_, where treating of the Virtues of the (already divers times\r\nmention'd) Buckthorn Berries, he subjoyns the following account of several\r\nPigments that are made of them, not only according to the several ways of\r\nHandling them, but according to the differing Seasons of Maturity, at which\r\nthey are Gather'd; _Of these Berries_, (says he) _are made three several\r\nsorts of Colours as they shall be gather'd, that is, being gather'd while\r\nthey are Green, and kept Dry, are call'd Sapberries, which being steep'd\r\ninto some Allom-water, or fresh bruis'd into Allom-water, they give a\r\nreasonable fair Yellow Colour which Painters use for their Work, and\r\nBook-binders to Colour the edges of Books, and Leather-dressers to Colour\r\nLeather, as they use also to make a Green Colour, call'd Sap-green, taken\r\nfrom the Berries when they are Black, being bruis'd and put into a Brass or\r\nCopper Kettle or Pan, and there suffer'd to abide three or four_ _Days, or\r\na little heated upon the Fire, and some beaten Allom put unto them, and\r\nafterwards press'd forth, the Juice or Liquor is usually put in great\r\nBladders tied with strong thred at the Head and hung up untill it be Dry,\r\nwhich is dissolv'd in Water or Wine, but Sack_ (he affirms) _is the best to\r\npreserve the Colour from Starving, (as they call it) that is, from\r\nDecaying, and make it hold fresh the longer. The third Colour (where of\r\nnone_ (says he) _that I can find have made mention but only_ Tragus_) is a\r\nPurplish Colour, which is made of the Berries suffer'd to grow upon the\r\nBushes untill the middle or end of_ November, _that they are ready to drop\r\nfrom the Trees._\r\n\r\nAnd, I remember (_Pyrophilus_) that I try'd, with a success that pleas'd me\r\nwell enough, to make such a kind of Pigment, as Painters call Sap-green, by\r\na way not unlike that, deliver'd here by our Author, but I cannot now find\r\nany thing relating to that matter among my loose Papers. And my Trials were\r\nmade so many years ago, that I dare not trust my Memory for Circumstances,\r\nbut will rather tell you, that in a noted Colour-shop, I brought them by\r\nQuestions to confess to me, that they made their Sap-green much after the\r\nways by our _Botanist_ here mention'd. And on this occasion I shall add an\r\nObservation, which though it does not strictly belong to this place, may\r\nwell enough be mention'd here, namely, that I find by an account given us\r\nby the Learned _Clusius_, of _Alaternus_, that ev'n the Grosser Parts of\r\nthe same Plant, are some of them one Colour, and some another; For speaking\r\nof that Plant, he tells us, that the _Portugalls_ use the Bark to Dye their\r\nNets into a Red Colour, and with the Chips of the Wood, which are Whitish,\r\nthey Dye a Blackish Blew.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXX._\r\n\r\nAmong the Experiments that tend to shew that the change of Colours in\r\nBodies may proceed from the Vary'd Texture of their Parts, and the\r\nconsequent change of their Disposition to Reflect or Refract the Light,\r\nthat sort of Experiments must not be left unmention'd, which is afforded us\r\nby Chymical Digestions. For, if _Chymists_ will believe several famous\r\nWriters about what they call the Philosophers Stone, they must acknowledge\r\nthat the same Matter, seald up Hermetically in a Philosophical Egg, will by\r\nthe continuance of Digestion, or if they will have it so (for it is not\r\nMaterial in our case which of the two it be) of Decoction, run through a\r\ngreat Variety of differing Colours, before it come to that of the Noblest\r\n_Elixir_; whether that be Scarlet, or Purple, or what ever other Kind of\r\nRed. But without building any thing on so Obtruse and Questionable an\r\nOperation, (which yet may be pertinently represented to those that believe\r\nthe thing) we may observe, that divers Bodies digested in carefully-clos'd\r\nVessels, will in tract of time, change their Colour: As I have elsewhere\r\nmention'd my having observ'd ev'n in Rectify'd Spirit of Harts-horn, and as\r\nis evident in the Precipitations of Amalgams of Gold, and Mercury, without\r\nAddition, where by the continuance of a due Heat the Silver-Colour'd\r\nAmalgam is reduc'd into a shining Red Powder. Further Instances of this\r\nKind you may find here and there in divers places of my other Essays. And\r\nindeed it has been a thing, that has much contributed to deceive many\r\n_Chymists_, that there are more Bodies than one, which by Digestion will be\r\nbrought to exhibit that Variety and Succession of Colours, which they\r\nimagine to be Peculiar to what they call the _True matter of the\r\nPhilosophers_. But concerning this, I shall referr you to what you may\r\nelsewhere find in the Discourse written touching the passive Deceptions of\r\n_Chymists_, and more about the Production of Colours by Digestion you will\r\nmeet with presently. Wherefore I shall now make only this Observation from\r\nwhat has been deliver'd, That in these Operations there appears not any\r\ncause to attribute the new Colours emergent to the Action of a new\r\nSubstantial form, nor to any Increase or Decrement of either the Salt,\r\nSulphur, or Mercury of the Matter that acquires new Colours: For the\r\nVessels are clos'd, and these Principles according to the _Chymists_ are\r\nIngenerable and Incorruptible; so that the Effect seems to proceed from\r\nhence, that the Heat agitating and shuffling the Corpuscles of the Body\r\nexpos'd to it, does in process of time so change its Texture, as that the\r\nTransposed parts do Modifie the incident Light otherwise, than they did\r\nwhen the Matter appear'd of another Colour.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXXI._\r\n\r\nAmong the several changes of Colour, which Bodies acquire or disclose by\r\nDigestion, it it very remarkable, that _Chymists_ find a Redness rather\r\nthan any other Colour in most of the Tinctures they Draw, and ev'n in the\r\nmore Gross Solutions they make of almost all Concretes, that abound either\r\nwith Mineral or Vegetable Sulphur, though the _Menstruum_ imploy'd about\r\nthese Solutions or Tinctures be never so Limpid or Colourless.\r\n\r\nThis we have observ'd in I know not how many Tinctures drawn with Spirit of\r\nWine from _Jalap_, _Guaicum_, and several other Vegetables; and not only in\r\nthe Solutions of _Amber_, _Benzoin_, and divers other Concretes made with\r\nthe same _Menstruum_, but also in divers Mineral Tinctures. And, not to\r\nurge that familiar Instance of the Ruby of Sulphur, as _Chymists_ upon the\r\nscore of its Colour, call the Solution of Flowers of Brimstone, made with\r\nthe Spirit of Turpentine, nor to take notice of other more known Examples\r\nof the aptness of Chymical Oyls, to produce a Red Colour with the Sulphur\r\nthey extract, or dissolve; not to insist (I say) upon Instances of this\r\nnature, I shall further represent to you, as a thing remarkable, that, both\r\nAcid and Alcalizate Salts, though in most other cases of such contrary\r\nOperations, in reference to Colours, will with many Bodies that abound with\r\nSulphureous, or with Oyly parts, produce a Red; as is manifest partly in\r\nthe more Vulgar Instances of the Tinctures, or Solutions of Sulphur made\r\nwith _Lixiviums_, either of Calcin'd Tartar or Pot-ashes, and other Obvious\r\nexamples, partly by this, that the true Glass of Antimony extracted with\r\nsome Acid Spirits, with or without Wine, will yield a Red Tincture, and\r\nthat I know an Acid Liquor, which in a moment will turn Oyl of Turpentine\r\ninto a deep Red. But among the many Instances I could give you of the easie\r\nProduction of Redness by the Operation of Saline Spirit, as well as of\r\nSpirit of Wine; I remember two or three of those I have tried, which seem\r\nremarkable enough to deserve to be mention'd to you apart.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXXII._\r\n\r\nBut before we set them down, it will not perhaps appear impertinent to\r\npremise;\r\n\r\nThat there seems to be a manifest Disparity betwixt Red Liquors, so that\r\nsome of them may be said to have a Genuine Redness in comparison of others,\r\nthat have a Yellowish Redness: For if you take (for example) a good\r\nTincture of _Chochineel_, dilute it never so much with fair Water, you will\r\nnot (as far as I can judge by what I have tried) be able to make it a\r\nYellow Liquor. Insomuch that a Single drop of a rich Solution of\r\n_Cochineel_ in Spirit of Urine, being Diluted with above an Ounce of fair\r\nWater, exhibited no Yellowishness at all, but a fair (though somewhat\r\nfaint) Pinck or Carnation; and even when _Cochineel_ was by degrees Diluted\r\nmuch beyond the newly mention'd Colour, by the way formerly related to you\r\nin the twenty fourth Experiment, I remember not, that there appear'd in the\r\nwhole Trial any Yellow. But if you take Balsom of Sulphur (for Instance)\r\nthough it may appear in a Glass, where it has a good Thickness, to be of a\r\ndeep Red, yet if you shake the Glass, or pour a few drops on a sheet of\r\nWhite Paper, spreading them on it with your Finger, the Balsom that falls\r\nback along the sides of the Glass, and that which stains the Paper, will\r\nappear Yellow, not Red. And there are divers Tinctures, such as that of\r\nAmber made with Spirit of Wine, (to name now no more) that will appear\r\neither Yellow or Red, according as the Vessels that they fill, are Slender\r\nor Broad.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXXIII._\r\n\r\nBut to proceed to the Experiments I was about to deliver; _First_; Oyl or\r\nSpirit of Turpentine, though clear as fair Water, being Digested upon the\r\npurely White Sugar of Lead, has, in a short time, afforded us a high Red\r\nTincture, that some Artists are pleas'd to call the Balsom of _Saturn_,\r\nwhich they very much (and probably not altogether without cause) extoll as\r\nan excellent Medicine in divers Outward affections.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXXIV._\r\n\r\n_Next_, take of common Brimstone finely powdred five Ounces, of\r\nSal-Armoniack likewise pulveriz'd an equal weight, of beaten Quick-lime six\r\nOunces, mix these Powders exquisitely, and Distill them through a Retort\r\nplac'd in Sand by degrees of Fire, giving at length as intense a Heat as\r\nyou well can in Sand, there will come over (if you have wrought well) a\r\nVolatile Tincture of Sulphur, which may probably prove an excellent\r\nMedicine, and should have been mention'd among the other Preparations of\r\nSulphur, which we have elsewhere imparted to you, but that it is very\r\npertinent to our present Subject, The change of Colours. For though none of\r\nthe Ingredients be Red, the Distill'd Liquor will be so: and this Liquor if\r\nit be well Drawn, will upon a little Agitation of the Vial first unstop'd\r\n(especially if it be held in a Warmer hand) lend forth a copious Fume, not\r\nRed, like that of Nitre, but White; And sometimes this Liquor may be so\r\nDrawn, that I remember, not long since, I took pleasure to observe in a\r\nparcel of it, that Ingredients not Red, did not only yield by Distillation\r\na Volatile Spirit that was Red, but though that Liquor did upon the bare\r\nopening of the Bottle it was kept in, drive us away with the plenty and\r\nsulphureous sent of a White steam which it sent forth, yet the Liquor it\r\nself being touch'd by our Fingers, did immediately Dye them Black.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXXV._\r\n\r\nThe third and _last_ Experiment I shall now mention to shew, how prone\r\nBodies abounding in Sulphureous parts are to afford a Red Colour, is one,\r\nwherein by the Operation of a Saline Spirit upon a White or Whitish Body,\r\nwhich according to the _Chymists_ should be altogether Sulphureous, a\r\nRedness may be produc'd, not (as in the former Experiments) slowly, but in\r\nthe twinkling of an Eye. We took then of the Essential Oyl of Anniseeds,\r\nwhich has this Peculiarity, that in Cold weather it loses its Fluidity and\r\nthe greatest part of its Transparency, and looks like a White or Whitish\r\nOyntment, and near at hand seems to consist of a Multitude of little soft\r\nScales: Of this Coagulated Stuff we spread a little with a Knife upon a\r\npiece of White Paper, and letting fall on it, and mixing with it a drop or\r\ntwo of Oyl of Vitriol, immediately (as we fore-saw) there emerg'd together\r\nwith some Heat and Smoak, a Blood-Red Colour, which therefore was in a\r\ntrice produc'd by two Bodies, whereof the one had but a Whitish Colour, and\r\nthe other (if carefully rectify'd) had no Colour at all.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXXVI._\r\n\r\nBut on this Occasion (_Pyrophilus_) we must add once for all, that in many\r\nof the above-recited Experiments, though the changes of Colour happen'd as\r\nwe have mention'd them: yet the emergent or produc'd Colour is oft times\r\nvery subject to Degenerate, both quickly and much. Notwithstanding which,\r\nsince the Changes, we have set down, do happen presently upon the Operation\r\nof the Bodies upon each other, or at the times by us specify'd; _that_ is\r\nsufficient both to justifie our Veracity, and to shew what we Intend; it\r\nnot being Essential to the Genuineness of a Colour to be Durable. For a\r\nfading Leaf, that is ready to Rot, and moulder into Dust, may have as true\r\na Yellow, as a Wedge of Gold, which so obstinately resists both Time and\r\nFire. And the reason, why I take occasion from the former Experiment to\r\nsubjoyn this general Advertisement, is, that I have several times observ'd,\r\nthat the Mixture resulting from the Oyls of Vitriol, and of Anniseeds,\r\nthough it acquire a thicker consistence than either of the Ingredients had,\r\nhas quickly lost its Colour, turning in a very short time into a dirty\r\nGray, at least in the Superficial parts, where 'tis expos'd to the Air;\r\nwhich last Circumstance I therefore mention, because that, though it seem\r\nprobable, that this Degeneration of Colours may oft times and in divers\r\ncases proceed from the further Action of the Saline Corpuscles, and the\r\nother Ingredients upon one another, yet in many cases much of the Quick\r\nchange of Colours seems ascribeable to the Air, as may be made probable by\r\nseveral reasons: The first whereof may be fetcht from the newly recited\r\nExample of the two Oyls; The next may be, that we have sometimes observ'd\r\nlong Window-Curtains of light Colours, to have that part of them, which was\r\nexpos'd to the Air, when the Window was open, of one Colour, and the lower\r\npart, that was sheltred from the Air by the Wall, of another Colour: And\r\nthe third Argument may be fetch'd from divers Observations, both of others,\r\nand our own; For of that Pigment so well known in Painters Shops, by the\r\nname of _Turnsol_, our Industrious _Parkinson_, in the particular account\r\nhe gives of the Plant that bears it, tells us also, That _the Berries when\r\nthey are at their full Maturity, have within them between the outer Skin\r\nand the inward Kirnel or Seed, a certain Juice or Moisture, which being\r\nrubb'd upon Paper or Cloath, at the first appears of a fresh and lovely\r\nGreen Colour, but presently changeth into a kind of Blewish Purple, upon\r\nthe Cloath or Paper, and the same Cloath afterwards wet in Water, and wrung\r\nforth, will Colour the Water into a Claret Wine Colour, and these_\r\n(concludes he) _are those Raggs of Cloath, which are usually call'd_\r\nTurnsol _in the Druggists or Grocers Shops_[21]. And to this Observation of\r\nour _Botanist_ we will add an Experiment of our own, (made before we met\r\nwith That) which, though in many Circumstances, very differing, serves to\r\nprove the same thing; for having taken of the deeply Red Juice of\r\n_Buckthorn_ Berries, which I bought of the Man that uses to sell it to the\r\nApothecaries, to make their Syrrup _de Spina Cervina_, I let some of it\r\ndrop upon a piece of White Paper, and having left it there for many hours,\r\ntill the Paper was grown dry again, I found what I was inclin'd to suspect,\r\nnamely, That this Juice was degenerated from a deep Red to a dirty kind of\r\nGreyish Colour, which, in a great part of the stain'd Paper seem'd not to\r\nhave so much as an Eye of Red: Though a little Spirit of Salt or dissolv'd\r\n_Alcaly_ would turn this unpleasant Colour (as formerly I told you it would\r\nchange the not yet alter'd Juice) into a Red or Green. And to satisfie my\r\nself, that this Degeneration of Colour did not proceed from the Paper, I\r\ndrop'd some of the deep Red or Crimson Juice upon a White glaz'd Tile, and\r\nsuffering it to dry on there, I found that ev'n in that Body, on which it\r\ncould not Soak, and by which it could not be Wrought, it nevertheless lost\r\nits Colour. And these Instances (_Pyrophilus_) I am the more carefull to\r\nmention to you, that you may not be much Surpris'd or Discourag'd, if you\r\nshould sometimes miss of performing punctually what I affirm my self to\r\nhave done in point of changing Colours; since in these Experiments the\r\nover-sight or neglect of such little Circumstances, as in many others would\r\nnot be perhaps considerable, may occasion the mis-carrying of a Trial. And\r\nI was willing also to take this occasion of Advertising you in the\r\nrepeating of the Experiments mention'd in this Treatise, to make use of the\r\nJuices of Vegetables, and other things prepar'd for your Trials, as soon as\r\never they are ready, lest one or other of them grow less fit, if not quite\r\nunfit by delay; and to estimate the Event of the Trials by the Change, that\r\nis produc'd presently upon the due and sufficient Application of Actives to\r\nPassives, (as they speak) because in many cases the effects of such\r\nMixtures may not be lasting, and the newly produc'd Colour may in a little\r\ntime degenerate. But, (_Pyrophilus_) I forgot to add to the two former\r\nObservations lately made about Vegetables, a third of the same Import, made\r\nin Mineral substances, by telling you, That the better to satisfie a Friend\r\nor two in this particular, I sometimes made, according to some Conjectures\r\nof mine, this Experiment; That having dissolv'd good Silver in\r\n_Aqua-fortis_, and Precipitated it with Spirit of Salt, upon the first\r\nDecanting of the Liquor, the remaining Matter would be purely White; but\r\nafter it had lain a while uncover'd, that part of it, that was Contiguous\r\nto the Air, would not only lose its Whiteness, but appear of a very Dark\r\nand almost Blackish Colour, I say that part that was Contiguous to the Air,\r\nbecause if that were gently taken off, the Subjacent part of the same Mass\r\nwould appear very White, till that also, having continu'd a while expos'd\r\nto the Air, would likewise Degenerate. Now whether the Air perform these\r\nthings by the means of a Subtile Salt, which we elsewhere show it not to be\r\ndestitute of, or by a peircing Moisture, that is apt easily to insinuate it\r\nself into the Pores of some Bodies, and thereby change their Texture, and\r\nso their Colour; Or by solliciting the Avolation of certain parts of the\r\nBodies, to which 'tis Contiguous; or by some other way, (which possibly I\r\nmay elsewhere propose and consider) I have not now the leisure to\r\ndiscourse. And for the same reason, though I could add many other\r\nInstances, of what I formerly noted touching the emergency of Redness upon\r\nthe Digestion of many Bodies, insomuch that I have often seen upon the\r\nBorders of _France_ (and probably we may have the like in _England_) a sort\r\nof Pears, which digested for some time with a little Wine, in a Vessel\r\nexactly clos'd, will in not many hours appear throughout of a deep Red\r\nColour, (as also that of the Juice, wherein they are Stew'd, becomes) but\r\nev'n on pure and white Salt of Tartar, pure Spirit of Wine, as clear as\r\nRock-water, will (as we elsewhere declare) by long Digestion acquire a\r\nRedness; Though I say such Instances might be Multiply'd, and though there\r\nbe some other Obvious changes of Colours, which happen so frequently, that\r\nthey cannot but be as well Considerable as Notorious; such as is the\r\nBlackness of almost all Bodies burn'd in the open Air: yet our haste\r\ninvites us to resign you the Exercise of enquiring into the Causes of these\r\nChanges. And certainly, the reason both _why_ the Soots of such differing\r\nBodies are almost all of them all Black, _why_ so much the greater part of\r\nVegetables should be rather Green than of any other Colour, and\r\nparticularly (which more directly concerns this place) _why_ gentle Heats\r\ndo so frequently in Chymical Operations produce rather a Redness than\r\nanother Colour in digested _Menstruums_, not only Sulphureous, as Spirit of\r\nWine, but Saline, as Spirit of Vinegar, may be very well worth a serious\r\nInquiry; which I shall therefore recommend to _Pyrophilus_ and his\r\nIngenious Friends.\r\n\r\n  [21] _Parkinson_, Thea. Bot. Trib. 4 cap. 12.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXXVII._\r\n\r\nIt may seem somewhat strange, that if you take the Crimson Solution of\r\n_Cochineel_, or the Juice of Black Cherries, and of some other Vegetables\r\nthat afford the like Colour, (which because many take but for a deep Red,\r\nwe do with them sometimes call it so) and let some of it fall upon a piece\r\nof Paper, a drop or two of an Acid Spirit, such as Spirit of Salt, or\r\n_Aqua-fortis_, will immediately turn it into a fair Red. Whereas if you\r\nmake an Infusion of Brazil in fair Water, and drop a little Spirit of Salt\r\nor _Aqua-fortis_ into it, that will destroy its Redness, and leave the\r\nLiquor of a Yellow, (sometimes Pale) I might perhaps plausibly enough say\r\non this occasion, that if we consider the case a little more attentively,\r\nwe may take notice, that the action of the Acid Spirit seems in both cases,\r\nbut to weaken the Colour of the Liquor on which it falls. And so though it\r\ndestroy Redness in the Tincture of Brazil, as well as produce Red in the\r\nTincture of _Chochineel_, its Operations may be Uniform enough, since as\r\nCrimson seems to be little else than a very deep Red, with (perhaps) an Eye\r\nof Blew, so some kinds of Red seem (as I have lately noted) to be little\r\nelse than heightned Yellow. And consequently in such Bodies, the Yellow\r\nseems to be but a diluted Red. And accordingly Alcalizate Solutions and\r\nUrinous Spirits, which seem dispos'd to Deepen the Colours of the Juices\r\nand Liquors of most Vegetables, will not only restore the Solution of\r\n_Cochineel_ and the Infusion of Brazil to the Crimson, whence the Spirit of\r\nSalt had chang'd them into a truer Red; but will also (as I lately told\r\nyou) not only heighthen the Yellow Juice of Madder into Red, but advance\r\nthe Red Infusion of Brazil to a Crimson. But I know not whether it will not\r\nbe much safer to derive these Changes from vary'd Textures, than certain\r\nkinds of Bodies; and you will perhaps think it worth while, that I should\r\nadd on this occasion, That it may deserve some Speculation, why,\r\nnotwithstanding what we have been observing, though Blew and Purple seem to\r\nbe deeper Colours than Red, and therefore the Juices of Plants of either of\r\nthe two former Colours may (congruously enough to what has been just now\r\nnoted) be turn'd Red by Spirit of Salt or _Aqua-fortis_, yet Blew Syrrup of\r\nViolets and some Purples should both by Oyl of Tartar and Spirit of Urine\r\nbe chang'd into Green, which seems to be not a deeper but a more diluted\r\nColour than Blew, if not also than Purple.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXXVIII._\r\n\r\nIt would much contribute to the History of Colours, if _Chymists_ would in\r\ntheir Laboratories take a heedfull notice, and give us a faithfull account\r\nof the Colours observ'd in the Steams of Bodies either Sublim'd or\r\nDistill'd, and of the Colours of those Productions of the Fire, that are\r\nmade up by the Coalition of those Steams. As (for Instance) we observe in\r\nthe Distilling of pure Salt peter, that at a certain season of the\r\nOperation, the Body, though it seem either Crystalline, or White, affords\r\nvery Red Fumes: whereas though Vitriol be Green or Blew, the Spirit of it\r\nis observ'd to come over in Whitish Fumes. The like Colour I have taken\r\nnotice of in the Fumes of several other Concretes of differing Colours, and\r\nNatures, especially when Distill'd with strong Fires. And we elsewhere\r\nnote, that ev'n Soot, as Black as it is, has fill'd our Receivers with such\r\ncopious White Fumes, that they seem'd to have had their In-sides wash'd\r\nwith Milk. And no less observable may be, the Distill'd Liqours, into which\r\nsuch Fumes convene, (for though we will not deny, that by skill and care a\r\nReddish Liqour may be obtain'd from Nitre) yet the common Spirit of it, in\r\nthe making ev'n of which store of these Red Fumes are wont to pass over\r\ninto the Receiver, appears not to be at all Red. And besides, that neither\r\nthe Spirit of Vitriol, nor that of Soot is any thing White; And, besides\r\nalso, that as far as I have observ'd, most (for I say not all) of the\r\nEmpyreumatical Oyls of Woods, and other Concretes, are either of a deep\r\nRed, or of a Colour between Red and Black; besides this, I say, 'tis very\r\nremarkable that notwithstanding that great Variety of Colours to be met\r\nwith in the Herbs, Flowers, and other Bodies wont to be Distill'd in\r\n_Balneo_: yet (as far at least as our common Distillers Experience\r\nreacheth) all the Waters and Spirits that first come over by that way of\r\nDistillation, leave the Colours of their Concretes behind them, though\r\nindeed there be one or two Vegetables not commonly taken notice of, whose\r\nDistill'd Liqours I elsewhere observe to carry over the Tincture of the\r\nConcrete with them. And as in Distillations, so in Sublimations, it were\r\nworth while to take notice of what comes up, in reference to our present\r\nscope, by purposely performing them (as I have in some cafes done) in\r\nconveniently shap'd Glasses, that the Colour of the ascending Fumes may be\r\ndiscern'd; For it may afford a Naturalist good Information to observe the\r\nCongruities or the Differences betwixt the Colours of the ascending Fumes,\r\nand those of the _Flowers_, they compose by their Convention. For it is\r\nevident, that these _Flowers_, do many of them in point of Colour, much\r\ndiffer, not only from one another, but oft times from the Concretes that\r\nafforded them. Thus, (not here to repeat what I formerly noted of the Black\r\nSoots of very differingly Colour'd Bodies) though Camphire and Brimstone\r\nafford _Flowers_ much of their own Colour, save that those of Brimstone are\r\nwont to be a little Paler, than the Lumps that yielded them; yet ev'n of\r\nRed _Benzoin_, that sublim'd Substance, which _Chymists_ call its\r\n_Flowers_, is wont to be White or Whitish. And to omit other Instances,\r\nev'n one and the same Black Mineral, Antimony, may be made to afford\r\n_Flowers_, some of them Red, and some Grey, and, which is more strange,\r\nsome of them purely White. And 'tis the Prescription of some Glass-men by\r\nexquisitely mingling a convenient proportion of Brimstone, Sal-Armoniack,\r\nand Quicksilver, and Subliming them, together, to make a Sublimate of an\r\nexcellent Blew; and though having caus'd the Experiment to be made, we\r\nfound the produc'd Sublimate to be far from being of a lovely Colour, (as\r\nwas promis'd) that there and there, it seem'd Blewish, and at least was of\r\na Colour differing enough from either of the Ingredients, which is\r\nsufficient for our present purpose. But a much finer Colour is promis'd by\r\nsome of the Empiricks, that pretend to Secrets, who tell us, that Orpiment,\r\nbeing Sublim'd, will afford among the Parts of it that fly Upward, some\r\nlittle Masses, which, though the Mineral it self be of a good Yellow, will\r\nbe Red enough to emulate Rubies, both in Colour and Translucency. And this\r\nExperiment may, for ought I know, sometimes succeed; for I remember, that\r\nhaving in a small Bolt-head purposely sublim'd some powder'd Orpiment, we\r\ncould in the Lower part of the Sublimate discern here and there some\r\nReddish Lines, though much of the Upper part of the Sublimate consisted of\r\na matter, which was not alone purely Yellow, but transparent almost like a\r\nPowder. And we have also this way obtain'd a Sublimate, the Lower part\r\nwhereof though it consisted not of Rubies, yet the small pieces of it,\r\nwhich were Numerous enough, were of a pleasant Reddish Colour, and\r\nGlitter'd very prettily. But to insist on such kind of Trials and\r\nObservations (where the ascending Fumes of Bodies differ in Colour from the\r\nBodies themselves) though it might indeed Inrich the History of Colours,\r\nwould Robb me of too much of the little time I have to dispatch what I have\r\nfurther to tell you concerning them.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XXXIX_\r\n\r\nTake the dry'd Buds (or Blossoms) of the Pomegranate Tree, (which are\r\ncommonly call'd in the Shops _Balaustiums_) pull off the Reddish Leaves,\r\nand by a gentle Ebullition of them in fair Water, or by a competent\r\nInfusion of them in like Water well heated, extract a faint Reddish\r\nTincture, which if the Liquor be turbid, you may Clarifie it by Filtrating\r\nit Into this, if you pour a little good Spirit of Urine, or some other\r\nSpirit abounding in the like sort of Volatile Salts, the Mixture will\r\npresently turn of a dark Greenish Colour, but if instead of the\r\nfore-mention'd Liquor, you drop into the simple Infusion a little rectify'd\r\nSpirit of Sea-Salt, the Pale and almost Colourless Liquor will immediately\r\nnot only grow more Transparent, but acquire a high Redness, like that of\r\nRich Claret Wine, which so suddenly acquir'd Colour, may as quickly be\r\nDestroy'd and turn'd into a dirty Blewish Green, by the affusion of a\r\ncompetent quantity of the above-mention'd Spirit of Urine.\r\n\r\n_Annotation._\r\n\r\nThis Experiment may bring some Light to, and receive some from a couple of\r\nother Experiments, that I remember I have met with in the ingenious\r\n_Gassendus_'s Animadversions upon _Epicurus_'s Philosophy, whilst I was\r\nturning over the Leaves of those Learned Commentaries; (my Eyes being too\r\nweak to let me read such Voluminous Books quite thorough) And I the less\r\nscruple (notwithstanding my contrary Custom in this Treatise) to set down\r\nthese Experiments of another, because I shall a little improve the latter\r\nof them, and because by comparing there with that which I have last\r\nrecited, we may be assisted to Conjecture upon what account it is, that Oyl\r\nof Vitriol heightens the Tincture of Red-rose Leaves, since Spirit of Salt,\r\nwhich is a highly Acid _Menstruum_, but otherwise differing enough from Oyl\r\nof Vitriol, does the same thing. Our Authors Experiments then, as we made\r\nthem, are these; We took about a Glass-full of luke-warm Water, and in it\r\nimmerg'd a quantity of the Leaves of _Senna_, and presently upon the\r\nImmersion there did not appear any Redness in the Water, but dropping into\r\nit a little Oyl of Tartar, the Liquor soon discover'd a Redness to the\r\nwatchfull Eye, whereas by a little of that Acid Liquor of Vitriol, which is\r\nlike the former, undeservedly called Oyl, such a Colour would not be\r\nextracted from the infused _Senna_. On the other side we took some Red-rose\r\nLeaves dry'd, and having shaken them into a Glass of fair Water, they\r\nimparted to it no Redness, but upon the affusion of a little Oyl of Vitriol\r\nthe Water was immediately turn'd Red, which it would not have been, if\r\ninstead of Oyl of Vitriol, we had imployed Oyl of Tartar to produce that\r\nColour: That these were _Gassendus_ his Experiments, I partly remember, and\r\nwas assur'd by a Friend, who lately Transcribed them out of _Gassendus_ his\r\nBook, which I therefore add, because I have not now that Book at hand. And\r\nthe design of _Gassendus_ in these Experiments our Friend affirms to be, to\r\nprove, that of things not Red a Redness may be made only by Mixture, and\r\nthe Varied position of parts, wherein the Doctrine of that Subtil\r\nPhilosopher doth not a little Authorize, what we have formerly delivered\r\nconcerning the Emergency and Change of Colours. But the instances, that we\r\nhave out of him set down, seem not to be the most Eminent, that may be\r\nproduced of this truth: For our next Experiment will shew the production of\r\nseveral Colours out of Liquors, which have not any of them any such Colour,\r\nnor indeed any discernable one at all; and whereas though our Author tells\r\nus, that there was no Redness either in the Water, or the Leaves of\r\n_Senna_, or the Oyl of Tartar; And though it be true, that the Predominant\r\nColour of the Leaves of _Senna_ be another than Red, yet we have try'd,\r\nthat by steeping that Plant a Night even in Cold water, it would afford a\r\nvery deep Yellow or Reddish Tincture without the help of the Oyl of Tartar,\r\nwhich seems to do little more than assist the Water to extract more nimbly\r\na plenty of that Red Tincture, wherewith the Leaves of _Senna_ do of\r\nthemselves abound, and having taken off the Tincture of _Senna_, made only\r\nwith fair Water, before it grew to be Reddish, and Decanted it from the\r\nLeaves, we could not perceive, that by dropping some Oyl of Tartar into it,\r\nthat Colour was considerable, though it were a little heightned into a\r\nRedness; which might have been expected, if the particles of the Oyl did\r\neminently Co-operate, otherwise than we have expressed, to the production\r\nof this Redness.\r\n\r\nAnd as for the Experiment with Red-rose Leaves, the same thing may be\r\nalleged, for we found that such Leaves by bare Infusion for a Night and Day\r\nin fair Water, did afford us a Tincture bordering at least upon Redness,\r\nand that Colour being conspicuous in the Leaves themselves, would not by\r\nsome seem so much to be produc'd as to be extracted by the affusion of Oyl\r\nof Vitriol. And the Experiment try'd with the dry'd Leaves of Damask-roses\r\nsucceeded but imperfectly, but that is indeed observable to our Authors\r\npurpose, that Oyl of Tartar will not perform in this Experiment what Oyl of\r\nVitriol doth; but because this last named Liquor is not so easily to be\r\nhad, give me leave to Advertise you, that the Experiment will succeed, if\r\ninstead of it you imploy _Aqua-fortis_. And though some Trials of our own\r\nformerly made, and others easily deducible from what we have already\r\ndeliver'd, about the different Families and Operations of Salt, might\r\nenable us to present you an Experiment upon Red-rose Leaves, more\r\naccommodated to our Authors purpose, than that which he hath given us; yet\r\nour Reverence to so Candid a Philosopher, invites us rather to improve his\r\nExperiment, than substitute another in its place. Take therefore of the\r\nTincture of Red-rose Leaves, (for with Damask-rose Leaves the Experiment\r\nsucceedeth not well) made as before hath been taught with a little Oyl of\r\nVitriol, and a good quantity of fair Water, pour off this Liquor into a\r\nclear Vial, half fill'd with Limpid water; till the Water held against the\r\nLight have acquir'd a competent Redness, without losing its Transparency,\r\ninto this Tincture drop leisurely a little good Spirit of Urine, and\r\nshaking the Vial, which you must still hold against the Light, you shall\r\nsee the Red Liquor immediately turn'd into a fine Greenish Blew, which\r\nColour was not to be found in any of the Bodies, upon whose Mixture it\r\nemerg'd, and this Change is the more observable, because in many Bodies the\r\nDegenerating of Blew into Red is usual enough, but the turning of Red into\r\nBlew is very unfrequent. If at every drop of Spirit of Urine you shake the\r\nVial containing the Red Tincture, you may delightfully observe a pretty\r\nvariety of Colours in the passage of that Tincture from a Red to a Blew,\r\nand sometimes we have this way hit upon such a Liquor, as being look't upon\r\nagainst and from the Light, did seem faintly to emulate the above-mention'd\r\nTincture of _Lignum Nephriticum_. And if you make the Tincture of Red-roses\r\nvery high, and without Diluting it with fair Water, pour on the Spirit of\r\nUrine, you may have a Blew so deep, as to make the Liquor Opacous, but\r\nbeing dropt upon White Paper the Colour will soon disclose it self. Also\r\nhaving made the Red, and consequently the Blew Tincture very Transparent,\r\nand suffer'd it to rest in a small open Vial for a Day or two, we found\r\naccording to our Conjecture, that not only the Blew but the Red Colour also\r\nwas Vanish'd; the clear Liquor being of a bright Amber Colour, at the\r\nbottom of which subsided a Light, but Copious feculency of almost the same\r\nColour, which seems to be nothing but the Tincted parts of the Rose Leaves\r\ndrawn out by the Acid Spirits of the Oyl of Vitriol, and Precipitated by\r\nthe Volatile Salt of the Spirit of Urine, which makes it the more probable,\r\nthat the Redness drawn by the Oyl of Vitriol, was at least as well an\r\nextraction of the Tinging parts of the Roses, as a production of Redness;\r\nand lastly, if you be destitute of Spirit of Urine, you may change the\r\nColour of the Tincture of Roses with many other Sulphureous Salts, as a\r\nstrong Solution of Pot-ashes, Oyl of Tartar, &c. which yet are seldome so\r\nfree from Feculency, as the Spirituous parts of Urine becomes by repeated\r\nDistillation.\r\n\r\n_Annotation_.\r\n\r\nOn this, occasion, I call to mind, that I found, a way of producing, though\r\nnot the same kind of Blew, as I have been mentioning, yet a Colour near of\r\nKin to it, namely, a fair Purple, by imploying a Liquor not made Red by\r\nArt, instead of the Tincture of Red-roses, made with an Acid Spirit; And my\r\nway was only to take Log-wood, (a Wood very well known to Dyers) having by\r\nInfusion the Powder of it a while in fair Water made that Liquor Red, I\r\ndropt into it a _Tantillum_ of an Urinous Spirit, as that of Sal-Armoniack,\r\n(and I have done the same thing with an _Alcali_) by which the Colour was\r\nin a moment turn'd into a Rich, and lovely Purple. But care must be had,\r\nthat you let not fall into a Spoonfull above two or three Drops, lest the\r\nColour become so deep, as to make the Liquor too Opacous. And (to answer\r\nthe other part of _Gassendus_ his Experiment) if instead of fair Water, I\r\ninfus'd the Log-wood in Water made somewhat sowr by the Acid Spirit of\r\nSalt, I should obtain neither a Purple Liquor, nor a Red, but only a Yellow\r\none.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XL._\r\n\r\nThe Experiment I am now to mention to you, _Pyrophilus_, is that which both\r\nyou, and all the other _Virtuosi_ that have seen it, have been pleas'd to\r\nthink very strange; and indeed of all the Experiments of Colours, I have\r\nyet met with, it seems to be the fittest to recommend the Doctrine propos'd\r\nin this Treatise, and to shew that we need not suppose, that all Colours\r\nmust necessarily be Inherent Qualities, flowing from the Substantial Forms\r\nof the Bodies they are said to belong to, since by a bare Mechanical change\r\nof Texture in the Minute parts of Bodies; two Colours may in a moment be\r\nGenerated quite _De novo,_ and utterly Destroy'd. For there is this\r\ndifference betwixt the following Experiment, and most of the others\r\ndeliver'd in these Papers, that in this, the Colour that a Body already\r\nhad, is not chang'd into another, but betwixt two Bodies, each of them\r\napart devoid of Colour, there is in a moment generated a very deep Colour,\r\nand which if it were let alone, would be permanent; and yet by a very small\r\nParcel of a third Body, that has no Colour of its own, (lest some may\r\npretend I know not what Antipathy betwixt Colours) this otherwise permanent\r\nColour will be in another trice so quite Destroy'd, that there will remain\r\nno foot-stepts either of it or of any other Colour in the whole Mixture.\r\n\r\nThe Experiment is very easie, and it is thus perform'd: Take good common\r\nSublimate, and fully satiate with it what quantity of Water you please,\r\nFiltre the Solution carefully through clean and close Paper, that it may\r\ndrop down as Clear and Colourless as Fountain water. Then when you'l shew\r\nthe Experiment, put of it about a Spoonfull into a small Wine-glass, or any\r\nother convenient Vessel made of clear Glass, and droping in three or four\r\ndrops of good Oyl of Tartar, _per Deliquium_; well Filtred that it may\r\nlikewise be without Colour, these two Limpid Liquors will in the twinkling\r\nof an Eye turn into an Opacous mixture of a deep Orange Colour, which by\r\nkeeping the Glass continually shaking in your hand, you must preserve from\r\nsetling too soon to the Bottom; And when the Spectators have a little\r\nbeheld this first Change, then you must presently drop in about four or\r\nfive drops of Oyl of Vitriol, and continuing to shake the Glass pretty\r\nstrongly, that it may the Nimbler diffuse it self, the whole Colour, if you\r\nhave gone Skilfully to work, will immediately disappear, and all the Liquor\r\nin the Glass will be Clear and Colourless as before, without so much as a\r\nSediment at the Bottom. But for the more gracefull Trial of this\r\nExperiment, 'twill not be amiss to observe, First, That there should not be\r\ntaken too much of the Solution of Sublimate, nor too much of the Oyl of\r\nTartar drop'd in, to avoid the necessity of putting in so much Oyl of\r\nVitriol as may make an Ebullition, and perhaps run over the Glass.\r\nSecondly, That 'tis convenient to keep the Glass always a little shaking,\r\nboth for the better mixing of the Liquors, and to keep the Yellow Substance\r\nfrom Subsiding, which else it would in a short time do, though when 'tis\r\nsubsided it will retain its Colour, and also be capable of being depriv'd\r\nof it by the Oyl newly mention'd. Thirdly, That if any Yellow matter stick\r\nat the sides of the Glass, 'tis but inclining the Glass, till the clarify'd\r\nLiquor can wash alongst it, and the Liquor will presently imbibe it, and\r\ndeprive it of its Colour.\r\n\r\nMany have somewhat wondred, how I came to light upon this Experiment, but\r\nthe Notions or Conjectures I have about the differing Natures of the\r\nSeveral Tribes of Salts, having led me to devise the Experiment, it will\r\nnot be difficult for me to give you the Chymical Reason, if I may so speak,\r\nof the _Phænomenon_. Having then observ'd, that _Mercury_ being dissolv'd\r\nin Some _Menstruums_, would yield a dark Yellow Precipitate, and supposing\r\nthat, as to this, common Water, and the Salts that stick to the _Mercury_\r\nwould be equivalent to those Acid _Menstruums_, which work upon the\r\n_Quick-silver_, upon the account of their Saline particles, I substituted a\r\nSolution of Sublimate in fair Water, instead of a Solution of _Mercury_ in\r\n_Aqua-fortis_, or Spirit of _Nitre_, that simple Solution being both\r\nclearer and free from that very offensive Smell, which accompanies the\r\nSolutions of _Mercury_ made with those other corrosive Liquors; then I\r\nconsider'd, that That, which makes the Yellow Colour, is indeed but a\r\nPrecipitate made by the means of the Oyl of Tartar, which we drop in, and\r\nwhich, as _Chymists_ know, does generally precipitate Metalline Bodies\r\ncorroded by Acid Salts; so that the Colour in our case results from the\r\nCoalition of the Mercurial particles with the Saline ones, wherewith they\r\nwere formerly associated, and with the Alcalizate particles of the Salt of\r\nTartar that swim up and down in the Oyl. Wherefore considering also, that\r\nvery many of the effects of Lixiviate Liquors, upon the Solutions of other\r\nBodies, may be destroy'd by Acid _Menstruums_, as I elsewhere more\r\nparticularly declare, I concluded, that if I chose a very potently Acid\r\nLiquor, which by its Incisive power might undo the work of the Oyl of\r\nTartar, and disperse again those Particles, which the other had by\r\nPrecipitation associated, into such minute Corpuscles as were before singly\r\nInconspicuous, they would become Inconspicuous again, and consequently\r\nleave the Liquor as Colourless as before the Precipitation was made.\r\n\r\nThis, as I said, _Pyrophilus_, seems to be the Chymical reason of this\r\nExperiment, that is such a reason, as, supposing the truth of those\r\nChymical Notions I have elsewhere I hope evinc'd, may give such an account\r\nof the _Phænomena_ as Chymical Notions can supply us with; but I both here\r\nand elsewhere make use of this way of speaking, to intimate that I am\r\nsufficiently aware of the difference betwixt a Chymical Explication of a\r\n_Phænomenon_, and one that is truly Philosophical or Mechanical; as in our\r\npresent case, I tell you something, when I tell you that the Yellowness of\r\nthe Mercurial Solution and the Oyl of Tartar is produc'd by the\r\nPrecipitation occasion'd by the affusion of the latter of those Liquors,\r\nand that the destruction of the Colour proceeds from the Dissipation of\r\nthat Curdl'd matter, whose Texture is destroy'd, and which is dissolv'd\r\ninto Minute and Invisible particles by the potently Acid _Menstruum_, which\r\nis the reason, why there remains no Sediment in the Bottom, because the\r\ninfused Oyl takes it up, and resolves it into hidden or invisible Parts, as\r\nWater does Salt or Sugar. But when I have told you all this, I am far from\r\nthinking I have told all that such an Inquisitive Person as your self would\r\nknow, for I presume you would desire as well as I to learn (at least) why\r\nthe Particles of the _Mercury_, of the Tartar, and of the Acid Salts\r\nconvening together, should make rather an Orange Colour than a Red, or a\r\nBlew, or a Green, for 'tis not enough to say what I related a little\r\nbefore, that divers Mercurial Solutions, though otherwise made, would yield\r\na Yellow precipitate, because the Question will recurr concerning them; and\r\nto give it a satisfactory answer, is, I freely acknowledge, more than I\r\ndare as yet pretend to.\r\n\r\nBut to confirm my conjecture about the Chymical reason of our Experiment, I\r\nmay add, that as I have (_viz._ pag. 34th. of this Treatise) elsewhere (on\r\nanother occasion) told you, with Saline Liquors of another kind and nature\r\nthan Salt of Tartar, (namely, with Spirit of Urine, and Liquors of kin to\r\nthat) I can make the _Mercury_ precipitate out of the first simple Solution\r\nquite of another Colour than that hitherto mention'd; Nay, if instead of\r\naltering the Precipitating liquor, I alter'd the Texture of the Sublimate\r\nin such a way as my Notions about Salt requir'd, I could produce the same\r\n_Phænomenon_. For having purposely Sublim'd together Equal parts (or\r\nthereabout) of Sal-Armoniack and Sublimate, first diligently Mix'd, the\r\nascending Flowers being diffolv'd in fair Water, and Filtred, gave a\r\nSolution Limpid and Colourless, like that of the other Sublimates, and yet\r\nan _Akaly_ drop'd into this Liquor did not turn it Yellow but White. And\r\nupon the same Grounds we may with _Quick-silver_, without the help of\r\ncommon Sublimate, prepare another sort of Flowers dissoluble in Water\r\nwithout Discolouring it, with which I could likewise do what I newly\r\nmention'd; to which I shall add, (what possibly you'l somewhat wonder at)\r\nThat so much does the Colour depend upon the Texture resulting from the\r\nConvention of the several sorts of Corpuscles, that though in out\r\nExperiment, Oyl of Vitriol destroys the Yellow Colour, yet with\r\n_Quick-silver_ and fair Water, by the help of Oyl of Vitriol alone, we may\r\neasily make a kind of Precipitate of a fair and permanent Yellow, as you\r\nwill e're long (in the forty second Expement of this third Part) be taught.\r\nAnd I may further add, that I chose Oyl of Vitriol, not so much for any\r\nother or peculiar Quality, as for its being, when 'tis well rectify'd,\r\n(which 'tis somewhat hazardous to bring it to be) not only devoid of Colour\r\nand in Smells, but extremely Strong and Incisive; For though common and\r\nundephlegmated _Aqua-fortis_ will not perform the same thing well, yet that\r\nwhich is made exceeding Strong by being carefully Dephlegm'd, will do it\r\npretty well, though not so well as Oyl of Vitriol which is so Strong, that\r\neven without Rectification it may for a need be made use of. I will not\r\nhere tell you what I have try'd, that I may be able to deprive at pleasure\r\nthe Precipitate that one of the Sulphureous Liquors had made, by the\r\ncopious Affusion of the other: Because I found, though this Experiment is\r\ntoo ticklish to let me give a full account of it in few words, I shall\r\ntherefore tell you, that it is not only for once, that the other\r\nabove-mention'd Experiment may be made, the same Numerical parcels of\r\nLiquor being still imploy'd in it; for after I have Clarify'd the Orange\r\nColour'd Liquor, by the addition of as little of the Oyl of Viriol as will\r\nsuffice to perform the effect, I can again at pleasure re-produce the\r\nOpacous Colour, by the dropping in of fresh Oyl of Tartar, and destroy it\r\nagain by the Re-affusion of more of the Acid _Menstruum_; and yet oftner if\r\nI please, can I with these two contrariant Liquors recall and disperse the\r\nColour, though by reason of the addition of so much new Liquor, in\r\nreference to the Mercurial particles, the Colour will at length appear more\r\ndilute and faint.\r\n\r\n_An improvement of the fortieth Experiment_.\r\n\r\nAnd, _Pyrophilus_, to confirm yet further the Notions that led me to think\r\non the propos'd Experiment, I shall acquaint you with another, which when I\r\nhad conveniency I have sometimes added to it, and which has to the\r\nSpectators appear'd little less Odd than the first; And though because the\r\nLiquor, requisite to make the Trial succeed well, must be on purpose\r\nprepar'd anew a while before, because it will not long retain its fitness\r\nfor this work, I do but seldome annex this Experiment to the other, yet I\r\nshall tell you how I devis'd it, and how I make it. If you boyl Crude\r\nAntimony in a strong and clear _Lixivium_, you shall separate a Substance\r\nfrom it, which some Modern _Chymists_ are pleas'd to call its Sulphur, but\r\nhow deservedly I shall not here examine, having elsewhere done it in an\r\nOpportune place; wherefore I shall now but need to take notice, that when\r\nthis suppos'd Sulphur (not now to call it rather a kind of _Crocus_) is let\r\nfall by the Liquor upon its Refrigeration, it often settles in Flakes, or\r\nsuch like parcels of a Yellow Substance, (which being by the precedent\r\ndissolution reduc'd into Minute parts, may peradventure be made to take\r\nFire much more easily than the Grosser Powder of unprepar'd Antimony would\r\nhave done.) Considering therefore, that common Sulphur boyl'd in a\r\n_Lixivium_ may be Precipitated out of it by Rhenish-wine or White-wine,\r\nwhich are Sowrish Liquors, and have in them, as I elsewhere shew, an Acid\r\nSalt; and having found also by Trial, that with other Acid Liquors I could\r\nPrecipitate out of Lixiviate Solvents some other Mineral concretions\r\nabounding with Sulphureous parts, of which sort is crude Antimony, I\r\nconcluded it to be easie to Precipitate the Antimony dissolv'd, as was\r\nlately mention'd, with the Acid Oyl of Vitriol; and though common Sulphur\r\nyields a White Precipitate, which the _Chymists_ call _Lac Sulphuris_, yet\r\nI suppos'd the Precipitated Antimony would be of a deep Yellow Colour, as\r\nwell, if made with Oyl of Vitriol, as if made only by Refrigeration and\r\nlength of Time. From this 'twas easie to deduce this Experiment, that if\r\nyou put into one Glass some of the freshly Impregnated and Filtrated\r\nSolution of Antimony, and into another some of the Orange-Colour'd Mixture,\r\n(which I formerly shew'd you how to make with a Mercurial Solution and Oyl\r\nof Tartar) a few drops of Oyl of Vitriol dropp'd into the last mention'd\r\nGlass, would, as I told you before, turn the Deep Yellow mixture into a\r\nCleer Liquor; whereas a little of the same Oyl dropp'd out of the same Viol\r\ninto the other Glass would presently (but not without some ill sent) turn\r\nthe moderately cleer Solution into a Deep Yellow Substance, But this, as I\r\nSaid, succeeds not well, unless you employ a _Lixivium_ that has but newly\r\ndissolv'd Antimony, and has not yet let it fall. But yet in Summer time, if\r\nyour _Lixivium_ have been duly Impregnated and well Filtred after it is\r\nquite cold, it will for some dayes (perhaps much longer than I had occasion\r\nto try) retain Antimony enough to exhibit, upon the Affusion of the\r\nCorrosive Oyl, as much of a good Yellow Substance as is necessary to\r\nsatisfie the Beholders of the Possibility of the Experiment.\r\n\r\n_Reflections upon the XL. Experiment Compared with the X. and XX._\r\n\r\nThe Knowledge of the Distinction of Salts which we have propos'd, whereby\r\nthey are discriminated into _Acid, Volatile,_ or _Salfuginous_ (if I may\r\nfor Distinction sake so call the Fugitive Salts of Animal Substances) and\r\n_fix'd_ or _Alcalizate_, may possibly (by that little part which we have\r\nalready deliver'd, of what we could say of its Applicableness) appear of so\r\nmuch Use in Natural Philosophy (especially in the Practick part of it) that\r\nI doubt not but it will be no Unwelcome Corollary of the Preceding\r\nExperiment, if by the help of it I teach you to distinguish, which of those\r\nSalts is Predominant in Chymical Liquors, as well as whether any of them be\r\nso or not. For though in our Notes upon the X. and XX. Experiments I have\r\nshown you a way by means of the Tincture of _Lignum Nephriticum_, or of\r\nSyrrup of Violets, to discover whether a propounded Salt be Acid or not,\r\nyet you can thereby only find in general that such and such Salts belong\r\nnot to the Tribe of Acids, but cannot determine whether they belong to the\r\nTribe of Urinous Salts (under which for distinction sake I comprehend all\r\nthose Volatile Salts of Animal or other Substances that are contrary to\r\nAcids) or to that of Alcalies. For as well the one as the other of these\r\nSalino-Sulphurous Salts will restore the Cæruleous Colour to the Tincture\r\nof _Lignum Nephriticum_, and turn that of Syrrup of Violets into Green.\r\nWherefore this XL. Experiment does opportunely supply the deficiency of\r\nthose. For being sollicitous to find out some ready wayes of discriminating\r\nthe Tribes of Chymical Salts, I found that all those I thought fit to make\r\nTryal of, would, if they were of a Lixiviate Nature, make with Sublimate\r\ndissolv'd in Fair Water an _Orange Tawny_ Precipitate; whereas if they were\r\nof an Urinous Nature the Precipitate would be _White_ and Milky. So that\r\nhaving alwayes by me some Syrrup of Violets and some Solution of Sublimate,\r\nI can by the help of the first of those Liquors discover in a trice,\r\nwhether the propounded Salt or Saline Body be of an Acid Nature or no, if\r\nit be I need (you know) inquire no further; but if it be not, I can very\r\neasily, and as readily distinguish between the other two kinds of Salts, by\r\nthe White or Orange-Colour that is immediately produc'd, by letting fall a\r\nfew Drops or Grains of the Salt to be examin'd, into a spoonfull of the\r\ncleer Solution of Sublimate. For Example, it has been suppos'd by some\r\neminently Learned, That when Sal Armoniack being mingled with an Alcaly is\r\nforc'd from it by the Fire in close Vessels, the Volatile Salt that will\r\nthereby be obtain'd (if the Operation be skilfully perform'd,) is but a\r\nmore fine and subtile sort of Sal Armoniack, which, 'tis presum'd, this\r\nOperation do's but more exquisitely purifie, than common Solutions,\r\nFiltrations, and Coagulations. But this Opinion may be easily shown to be\r\nErroneous, as by other Arguments, so particularly by the lately deliver'd\r\nMethod of distinguishing the Tribes of Salts. For the Saline Spirit of Sal\r\nArmoniack, as it is in many other manifest Qualities very like the Spirit\r\nof Urine, so like, that it will in a trice make Syrrup of Violets of a\r\nLovely Green, turn a Solution of good Verdigrease into an Excellent Azure,\r\nand make the Solution of a Sublimate yield a White Precipitate, insomuch\r\nthat in most (for I say not all of the Experiments) where I Aim onely at\r\nproducing a sudden change of Colour, I scruple not to use Spirit of Sal\r\nArmoniack when it is at hand, instead of Spirit of Urine, as indeed it\r\nseems chiefly to consist (besides the flegm that helps to make it fluid) of\r\nthe Volatile Urinous Salt (yet not excluding that of Soot) that abounds in\r\nthe Sal Armoniack and is set at liberty from the Sea Salt wherewith it was\r\nformerly associated, and clogg'd, by the Operation of the Alcaly, that\r\ndivides the Ingredients of Sal Armoniack, and retains that Sea Salt with it\r\nself. What use may be made of the like way of exploration in that inquiry\r\nwhich puzzles so many Modern Naturalists, whether the Rich Pigment (which\r\nwe have often had occasion to mention) belongs to the Vegetable or Animal\r\nKingdome, you may find in another place where I give you some account of\r\nwhat I try'd about Cocheneel. But I think it needless to exemplifie here\r\nour Method by any other Instances, many such being to be met with in divers\r\nparts of this Treatise; but I will rather advertise you, that, by this way\r\nof examining Chymical Liquors, you may not onely in most Cases conclude\r\n_Affirmatively_, but in some Cases _Negatively_. As since Spirit of Wine,\r\nand as far as I have try'd, those Chymical Oyles which Artists call\r\nEssential, did not (when I us'd them as I had us'd the several Families of\r\nSalts upon that Syrrup) turn Syrrup of Violets Red or Green, nor the\r\nSolution of Sublimate White or Yellow, I inferr'd it may thence be probably\r\nargued, that either they are destitute of Salt, or have such as belongs not\r\nto either of the three Grand families already often mention'd. When I went\r\nto examine the Spirit of Oak or of such like Concretes forced over through\r\na Retort, I found by this means amongst others, that (as I elsewhere show)\r\nthese Chymists are much mistaken in it, that account it a simple Liquor,\r\nand one of their Hypostatical Principles: for not to mention what flegm it\r\nmay have, I found that with a few drops of one of this sort of Spirits\r\nmix'd with a good proportion of Syrrup of Violets, I could change the\r\nColour and make it Purplish, by the affinity of which Colour to Redness, I\r\nconjectur'd that this Spirit had some Acid Corpuscles in it, and\r\naccordingly I found that as it would destroy the Blewness of a Tincture of\r\n_Lignum Nephriticum_, so being put upon Corals it would Corrode them, as\r\ncommon Spirit of Vinegar, and other Acid Liquors are wont to do. And\r\nfarther to examine whether there were not a great part of the Liquor that\r\nwas not of an Acid nature, having separated the Sour or Vinegar-like part\r\nfrom the rest, which (if I mistake not) is far the more Copious, we\r\nconcluded as we had conjectured, the other or remaining part, though it had\r\na strong taste as well as smell, to be of a nature differing from that of\r\neither of the three sorts of Salts above mention'd, since it did as little\r\nas Spirit of Wine, and Chymical Oyls, alter the Colour either of Syrrup of\r\nViolets or Solution of Sublimate, whence we also inferr'd that the change\r\nthat had been made of that Syrrup into a Purple Colour, was effected by the\r\nVinegar, that was one of the two Ingredients of the Liquor, which was wont\r\nto pass for a Simple or Uncompounded Spirit. And, upon this account, 'twas\r\nof the Spirit of Oak (and the like Concretes) freed from it's Vinegar that\r\nI elsewhere told you, that I had not then observ'd it, (and I have repeated\r\nthe Tryal but very lately) to destroy the Cæruleous Tincture of _Lignum\r\nNephriticum_. But this onely, _en passant_; for the Chief thing I had to\r\nadd was this, That by the same way may be examin'd and discover'd, divers\r\nchanges that are produc'd in Bodies either by Nature only, or by Art;\r\neither of them being able by changing the Texture of some Concretes I could\r\nname, to qualifie them to Operate after a New manner upon the above\r\nmention'd Syrrup, or Solution, or both. And by this means, to tell you that\r\nupon the by, I have been able to discover, that there may be made Bodies,\r\nwhich though they run _per Deliquium_, as readily as Salt of Tartar, belong\r\nin other respects, not to the family of Alcaliz, much less to that of\r\nSalfuginous, or that of Acid Salts. Perhaps too, I may know a way of making\r\na highly operative Saline Body that shall neither change the Colour of\r\nSyrrup of Violets, nor Precipitate the Solution of Sublimate; And, I can\r\nlikewise if I please conceal by what Liquors I perform such changes of\r\nColour, as I have been mentioning to you, by quite altering the Texture of\r\nsome ordinary Chymical productions, the Exploration of which is the main\r\nuse of the fortieth Experiment, which I think teaches not a little, if it\r\nteach us to discover the nature of those things (in reference to Salt) that\r\nare obtain'd by the ordinary Chymical Analysis of mix'd Bodyes, though\r\nperhaps there may be other Bodyes prepar'd by Chymistry which may have the\r\nsame Effects in the change of Colours; and yet be produc'd not from what\r\nChymists call the Resolution of Bodies, but from their Composition. But the\r\ndiscoursing of things of this nature is more proper for another place. I\r\nshall now onely add, what might perhaps have been more seasonably told you\r\nbefore; That the Reason why the way of Exploration of Salts hitherto\r\ndeliver'd, succeeds in the Solution of Sublimate, depends upon the\r\nparticular Texture of that Solution, as well as upon the differing Natures\r\nof the Saline Liquors imploy'd to Precipitate it. For Gold dissolv'd in\r\n_Aqua Regia_, whether you Precipitate it with Oyl of Tartar which is an\r\nAlcaly, or with Spirit of Urine, or Sal Armoniack which belongs to the\r\nfamily of Volatile Salts, will either way afford a Yellow substance: though\r\nwith such an Acid Liquor, as, I say not Spirit of Salt, the Body that\r\nyields it, being upon the matter an Ingredient of _Aqua Regis_, but Oyl of\r\nVitriol it self, I did not find that I could Precipitate the Metall out of\r\nthe Solution, or destroy the Colour of it, though the same Oyl of Vitriol\r\nwould readily Precipitate Silver dissolv'd in _Aqua-fortis_. And if you\r\ndissolve pure Silver in _Aqua-fortis_, and suffer it to shoot into\r\nCrystals, the cleer Solution of these made in fair Water, will afford a\r\nvery White Precipitate, whether it be made with an Alcaly, or an Acid\r\nSpirit, as that of Salt, whereas, which may seem somewhat strange, with\r\nSpirit of Sal Armoniack (that I us'd was made of Quicklime) I could obtain\r\nno such White Precipitate; that Volatile Spirit, nor (as I remember) that\r\nof Urine, scarce doing any more than striking down a very small quantity of\r\nMatter, which was neither White nor Whitish, so that the remaining Liquor\r\nbeing suffer'd to evaporate till the superfluous Moisture was gone, the\r\ngreatest part of the Metalline Corpuscles with the Saline ones that had\r\nimbib'd them, concoagulated into Salt, as is usual in such Solutions,\r\nwherein the Metall has not been Precipitated.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XLI._\r\n\r\nOf Kin to the last or fortieth Experiment is another which I remember I\r\nhave sometimes shewn to _Virtuosi_ that were pleas'd not to dislike it. I\r\ntook Spirit of Urine made by Fermentation, and with a due proportion of\r\nCopper brought into small parts, I obtain'd a very lovely Azure Solution,\r\nand when I saw the Colour was such as was requisite, pouring into a clean\r\nGlass, about a spoonfull of this tincted Liquor, (of which I us'd to keep a\r\nQuantity by me,) I could by shaking into it some drops of Strong Oyl of\r\nVitriol, deprive it in a trice of its Deep Colour, and make it look like\r\nCommon-water.\r\n\r\n_Annotation_.\r\n\r\nThis Experiment brings into my mind this other, which oftentimes succceds\r\nwell enough, though not quite so well as the former; Namely, that if into\r\nabout a small spoonfull of a Solution of good French Verdigrease made in\r\nfair Water, I drop't and shak'd some strong Spirit of Salt, or rather\r\ndeflegm'd _Aqua Fortis_, the Greenness of the Solution would be made in a\r\ntrice almost totally to disappear, & the Liquor held against the Light\r\nwould scarce seeme other than Cleer or Limpid, to any but an Attentive Eye,\r\nwhich is therefore remarkable; because we know that _Aqua-fortis_ corroding\r\nCopper, which is it that gives the Colour to Verdigrease, is wont to reduce\r\nit to a Green Blew Solution. But if into the other altogether or almost\r\nColourless Liquor I was speaking of, you drop a just quantity either of Oyl\r\nof Tartar or Spirit of Urine, you shall find that after the Ebullition is\r\nceas'd, the mixture will disclose a lively Colour, though somewhat\r\ndiffering from that which the Solution of Verdigrease had at first.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XLII._\r\n\r\nThat the Colour (_Pyrophilus_) of a Body may be chang'd by a Liquor which\r\nof it self is of no Colour, provided it be Saline, we have already\r\nmanifested by a multitude of instances. Nor doth it seem so strange,\r\nbecause Saline Particles swimming up and down in Liquors, have been by many\r\nobserv'd to be very operative in the Production and change of Colours. But\r\ndivers of our Friends that are not acquainted with Chymical Operations have\r\nthought it very strange that a White Body, and a Dry one too, should\r\nimmediately acquire a rich new Colour upon the bare affusion of\r\nSpring-Water destitute as well of adventitious Salt as of Tincture. And yet\r\n(_Pyrophilus_) the way of producing such a change of Colours may be easily\r\nenough lighted on by those that are conversant in the Solutions of Mercury.\r\nFor we have try'd, that though by Evaporating a Solution of Quick-Silver in\r\n_Aqua-fortis_, and abstracting the Liquor till the remaining matter began\r\nto be well, but not too strongly dryed, fair Water pour'd on the remaining\r\n_Calx_ made it but somewhat Yellowish; yet when we took good Quick-Silver,\r\nand three or four times its weight of Oyl of Vitriol, in case we in a Glass\r\nRetort plac'd in Sand drew off the Saline _Menstruum_ from the Metalline\r\nLiquor, till there remain'd a dry _Calx_ at the bottome, though this\r\nPrecipitate were a Snow White Body, yet upon pouring on it a large quantity\r\nof fair Water, we did almost in a moment perceive it to pass from a Milky\r\nColour to one of the loveliest Light Yellows that ever we had beheld. Nor\r\nis the Turbith Mineral, that Chymists extol for its power to Salivate, and\r\nfor other vertues, of a Colour much inferiour to this, though it be often\r\nmade with a differing proportion of the Ingredients, a more troublesome\r\nway. For _Beguinus_,[22] who calls it _Mercurius præcipitatus optimus_,\r\ntakes to one part of Quick-Silver, but two of Liquor, and that is Rectifi'd\r\nOyl of Sulphur, which is (in _England_ at least) far more scarce and dear\r\nthan Oyl of Vitriol; he also requires a previous Digestion, two or three\r\nCohobations, and frequent Ablutions with hot Distill'd Water, with other\r\nprescriptions, which though they may conduce to the Goodness of the\r\nMedicine, which is that he aims at, are troublesome, and, our Tryals have\r\ninform'd you unneccessary to the _obtaining the Lemmon Colour_ which he\r\nregards not. But though we have very rarely seen either in Painters Shops,\r\nor elsewhere a finer Yellow than that which we have divers times this way\r\nproduc'd (which is the more considerable, because durable and pleasant\r\nYellows are very hard to be met with, as may appear by the great use which\r\nPainters are for its Colours sake fain to make of that pernicious and heavy\r\nMineral, Orpiment) yet I fear our Yellow is too costly, to be like to be\r\nimploy'd by Painters, unless about Choice pieces of Work, nor do I know how\r\nwell it will agree with every Pigment, especially, wich Oyl'd Colours. And\r\nwhether this Experiment, though it have seem'd somewhat strange to most we\r\nhave shown it to, be really of another Nature than those wherein Saline\r\nLiquors are imploy'd, may, as we formerly also hinted, be so plausibly\r\ndoubted, that whether the Water pour'd on the _Calx_, do barely by imbibing\r\nsome of its Saline parts alter its Colour by altering its Texture, or\r\nwhether by dissolving the Concoagulated Salts, it does become a Saline\r\n_Menstruum_, and, as such, work upon the Mercury, I freely leave to you\r\n(_Pyrophilus_) to consider. And that I may give you some Assistance in your\r\nEnquiry, I will not only tell you, that I have several times with fair\r\nWater wash'd from this _Calx_, good store of strongly tasted Corpuscles,\r\nwhich by the abstraction of the _Menstruum_, I could reduce into Salt; but\r\nI will also subjoyn an Experiment, which I devis'd, to shew among other\r\nthings, how much a real and permanent Colour may be as it were drawn forth\r\nby a Liquor that has neither Colour, nor so much as Saline or other Active\r\nparts, provided it can but bring the parts of the Body it imbibes to\r\nconvene into clusters dispos'd after the manner requisite to the exhibiting\r\nof the emergent Colour. The Experiment was this.\r\n\r\n  [22] _Beguinus_, Tyr. Chy. Lib. 2º. Cap. 13º.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XLIII._\r\n\r\nWe took good common Vitriol, and having beaten it to Powder, and put it\r\ninto a Crucible, we kept it melted in a gentle heat, till by the\r\nEvaporation of some parts, and the shuffling of the rest, it had quite lost\r\nits former Colour, what remain'd we took out, and found it to be a friable\r\n_Calx_, of a dirty Gray. On this we pour'd fair Water, which it did not\r\nColour Green or Blew, but only seem'd to make a muddy mixture with it, then\r\nstopping the Vial wherein the Ingredients were put, we let it stand in a\r\nquiet place for some dayes, and after many hours the water having dissolv'd\r\na good part of the imperfectly calcin'd Body, the Vitriolate Corpuscles\r\nswiming to and fro in the Liquor, had time by their opportune Occursions to\r\nconstitute many little Masses of Vitriol, which gave the water they\r\nimpregnated a fair Vitriolate Colour; and this Liquor being pour'd off, the\r\nremaining dirty Powder did in process of time communicate the like Colour,\r\nbut not so deep, to a second parcel of cleer Water that we pour'd on it.\r\nBut this Experiment _Pyrophilus_ is, (to give you that hint by the way) of\r\ntoo Luciferous a Nature to be fit to be fully prosecuted, now that I am in\r\nhaste, and willing to dispatch what remains. And we have already said of\r\nit, as much as is requisite to our present purpose.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XLIV._\r\n\r\nIt may (_Pyrophilus_) somewhat contribute towards the shewing how much some\r\nColours depend upon the less or greater mixture, and (as it were,)\r\nContemperation of the Light with shades, to observe, how that sometimes the\r\nnumber of Particles, of the same Colour, receiv'd into the Pores of a\r\nLiquor, or swiming up and down in it, do seem much to vary the Colour of\r\nit. I could here present you with particular instances to show, how in many\r\n(if not most) consistent Bodyes, if the Colour be not a Light one, as\r\nWhite, Yellow, or the like, the closeness of parts in the Pigments makes it\r\nlook Blackish, though when it is display'd and laid on thinly, it will\r\nperhaps appear to be either Blew, or Green, or Red. But the Colours of\r\nconsistent Pigments, not being those which the Preamble of this Experiment\r\nhas lead you to expect Examples in, I shall take the instances I am now to\r\ngive you, rather from Liquors than Dry Bodyes. If then you put a little\r\nfair Water into a cleer and slender Vial, (or rather into one of those\r\npipes of Glass, which we shall by and by mention;) and let fall into it a\r\nfew drops of a strong Decoction or Infusion of _Cochineel_, or (for want of\r\nthat) of _Brazil_; you may see the tincted drops descend like little Clouds\r\ninto the Liquor; through which, if, by shaking the Vial, you diffuse them,\r\nthey will turn the water either of a Pinck Colour, or like that which is\r\nwont to be made by the washing of raw flesh in fair Water; by dropping a\r\nlittle more of the Decoction, you may heighten the Colour into a fine Red,\r\nalmost like that which ennobles Rubies; by continuing the affusion, you may\r\nbring the Liquor to a kind of a Crimson, and afterwards to a Dark and\r\nOpacous Redness, somewhat like that of Clotted Blood. And in the passage of\r\nthe Liquor from one of these Colours to the other, you may observe, if you\r\nconsider it attentively, divers other less noted Colours belonging to Red,\r\nto which it is not easie to give Names; especially considering how much the\r\nproportion of the Decoction to the fair Water, and the strength of that\r\nDecoction, together with that of the trajected Light and other\r\nCircumstances, may vary the Phænomena of this Experiment. For the\r\nconvenienter making whereof, we use instead of a Vial, any slender Pipe of\r\nGlass of about a foot or more in length, and about the thickness of a mans\r\nlittle finger; For, if leaving one end of this Pipe open, you Seal up the\r\nother Hermetically, (or at least stop it exquisitely with a Cork well\r\nfitted to it, and over-laid with hard Sealing Wax melted, and rubb'd upon\r\nit;) you shall have a Glass, wherein may be observ'd the Variations of the\r\nColours of Liquors much better than in large Vials, and wherein Experiments\r\nof this Nature may be well made with very small quantities of Liquor. And\r\nif you please, you may in this Pipe produce variety of Colours in the\r\nvarious parts of the Liquor, and keep them swimming upon one another\r\nunmix'd for a good while. And some have marveil'd to see, what variety of\r\nColours we have sometimes (but I confess rather by chance than skill)\r\nproduc'd in those Glasses, by the bare infusion of Brazil, variously\r\ndiluted with fair Water, and alter'd by the Infusion of several Chymical\r\nSpirits and other Saline Liquors devoid themselves of Colour, and when the\r\nwhole Liquor is reduc'd to an Uniform degree of Colour, I have taken\r\npleasure to make that very Liquor seem to be of Colours gradually\r\ndiffering, by filling with it Glasses of a Conical figure, (whether the\r\nGlass have its basis in the ordinary position, or turn'd upwards.) And yet\r\nyou need not Glasses of an extraordinary shape to see an instance of what\r\nthe vari'd mixture of Light and Shadow can do in the diversifying of the\r\nColour. For if you take but a large round Vial, with a somewhat long and\r\nslender Neck, and filling it with our Red Infusion of Brazil, hold it\r\nagainst the Light, you will discern a notable Disparity betwixt the Colour\r\nof that part of the Liquor which is in the Body of the Vial, and that which\r\nis more pervious to the Light in the Neck. Nay, I remember, that I once had\r\na Glass and a Blew Liquor (consisting chiefly (or only, if my memory\r\ndeceive me not,) of a certain Solution of Verdigrease) so fitted for my\r\npurpose, that though in other Glasses the Experiment would not succeed, yet\r\nwhen that particular Glass was fill'd with that Solution, in the Body of\r\nthe Vial it appear'd of a Lovely Blew, and in the neck, (where the Light\r\ndid more dilute the Colour,) of a manifest Green; and though I suspected\r\nthere might be some latent Yellowness in the substance of the neck of the\r\nGlass, which might with the Blew compose that Green, yet was I not\r\nsatisfi'd my self with my Conjecture, but the thing seem'd odd to me, as\r\nwell as to divers curious persons to whom it was shown. And I lately had a\r\nBroad piece of Glass, which being look'd on against the Light seem'd clear\r\nenough, and held from the Light appear'd very lightly discolour'd, and yet\r\nit was a piece knock'd off from a great lump of Glass, to which if we\r\nrejoyn'd it, where it had been broken off, the whole Mass was as green as\r\nGrass. And I have several times us'd Bottles and stopples that were both\r\nmade (as those, I had them from assur'd me) of the very same Metall, and\r\nyet whilst the bottle appear'd but inclining towards a Green, the Stopple\r\n(by reason of its great thickness) was of so deep a Colour that you would\r\nhardly believe they could possibly be made of the same materials. But to\r\nsatisfie some Ingenious Men, on another occasion, I provided my self of a\r\nflat Glass (which I yet have by me,) with which if I look against the Light\r\nwith the Broad side obverted to the Eye, it appeares like a good ordinary\r\nwindow Glass; but if I turn the Edge of it to my Eye, and place my Eye in a\r\nconvenient posture in reference to the Light, it may contend for deepness\r\nof Colour with an Emerald. And this Greeness puts me in mind of a certain\r\nthickish, but not consistent Pigment I have sometimes made, and can show\r\nyou when you please, which being dropp'd on a piece of White Paper appears,\r\nwhere any quantity of it is fallen, of a somewhat Crimson Colour, but being\r\nwith ones finger spread thinly on the Paper does presently exhibit a fair\r\nGreen, which seems to proceed only from its disclosing its Colour upon the\r\nExtenuation of its Depth into Superficies, if the change be not somewhat\r\nhelp'd by the Colours degenerating upon one or other of the Accounts\r\nformerly mention'd. Let me add, that having made divers Tryals with that\r\nBlew substance, which in Painters shops is call'd _Litmase_, we have\r\nsometimes taken Pleasure to observe, that being dissolv'd in a due\r\nproportion of fair Water, the Solution either oppos'd to the Light, or\r\ndropp'd upon White paper, did appear of a deep Colour betwixt Crimson and\r\nPurple; and yet that being spread very thin on the Paper and suffer'd to\r\ndry on there, the Paper was wont to appear Stain'd of a Fine Blew. And to\r\nsatisfie my selfe, that the diversity came not from the Paper, which one\r\nmight suspect capable of inbibing the Liquor, and altering the Colour, I\r\nmade the Tryal upon a flat piece of purely White Glass'd Earth, (which I\r\nsometimes make use of about Experiments of Colours) with an Event not\r\nunlike the former.\r\n\r\nAnd now I speak of _Litmass_, I will add, that having this very day taken a\r\npiece of it, that I had kept by me these several years, to make Tryals\r\nabout Colours, and having let fall a few drops of the strong Infusion of it\r\nin fair water, into a fine Crystal Glass, shap'd like an inverted Cone, and\r\nalmost full of fair Water, I had now (as formerly) the pleasure to see, and\r\nto show others, how these few tincted drops variously dispersing themselves\r\nthrough the Limpid Water, exhibited divers Colours, or varieties of Purple\r\nand Crimson. And when the Corpuscles of the Pigment seem'd to have equally\r\ndiffus'd themselves through the whole Liquor, I then by putting two or\r\nthree drops of Spirit of Salt, first made an odd change in the Colour of\r\nthe Liquor, as well as a visible commotion among its small parts, and in a\r\nshort time chang'd it wholly into a very Glorious Yellow, like that of a\r\nTopaz. After which if I let fall a few drops of the strong and heavy\r\nSolution of Pot-ashes, whose weight would quickly carry it to the sharp\r\nbottome of the Glass, there would soon appear four very pleasant and\r\ndistinct Colours; Namely, a Bright, but Dilute Colour at the picked bottome\r\nof the Glass; a Purple, a little higher; a deep and glorious Crimson,\r\n(which Crimson seem'd to terminate the operation of the Salt upward) in the\r\nconfines betwixt the Purple and the Yellow; and an Excellent Yellow, the\r\nsame that before enobled the whole Liquor, reaching from thence to the top\r\nof the Glass. And if I pleas'd to pour very gently a little Spirit of Sal\r\nArmoniack, upon the upper part of this Yellow, there would also be a Purple\r\nor a Crimson, or both, generated there, so that the unalter'd part of the\r\nYellow Liquor appear'd intercepted betwixt the two Neighbouring Colours.\r\n\r\nMy scope in this 3d. Experiment (_Pyrophilus_) is manifold, as first to\r\ninvite you to be wary in judging of the Colour of Liquors in such Glasses\r\nas are therein recommended to you, and consequently as much, if not more,\r\nwhen you imploy other Glasses. Secondly, That you may not think it strange,\r\nthat I often content my self to rub upon a piece of White paper, the Juice\r\nof Bodies I would examine, since not onely I could not easily procure a\r\nsufficient Quantity of the juices of divers of them; but in several Cases\r\nthe Tryals of the quantities of such Juices in Glasses would make us more\r\nlyable to mistakes, than the way that in those cases I have made use of.\r\nThirdly, I hope you will by these and divers other particulars deliver'd in\r\nthis Treatise, be easily induc'd to think that I may have set down many\r\nPhænomena very faithfully, and just as they appear'd to me, and yet by\r\nreason of some unheeded circumstance in the conditions of the matter, and\r\nin the degree of Light, or the manner of trying the Experiment, you may\r\nfind some things to vary from the Relations I make of them. Lastly, I\r\ndesign'd to give you an opportunity to free your self from the amazement\r\nwhich possesses most Men, at the Tricks of those Mountebancks that are\r\ncommonly call'd Water-drinkers. For though not only the vulgar, but ev'n\r\nmany persons that are far above that Rank, have so much admir'd to see, a\r\nman after having drunk a great deal of fair water, to spurt it out again in\r\nthe form of Claret Wine, Sack, and Milk, that they have suspected the\r\nintervening of Magick, or some forbidden means to effect what they\r\nconceived above the power of Art; yet having once by chance had occasion to\r\noblige a Wanderer that made profession of that and other Jugling Tricks, I\r\nwas easily confirm'd by his Ingenious confession to me, That this so much\r\nAdmir'd Art, indeed consisted rather in a few Tricks, than in any great\r\nSkill, in altering the Nature and Colours of things. And I am easy to be\r\nperswaded; that there may be a great deal of Truth in a little Pamphlet\r\nPrinted divers years ago in English, wherein the Author undertakes to\r\ndiscover, and that (if I mistake not) by the confession of some of the\r\nComplices themselves, That a famous Water-drinker then much Admir'd in\r\n_England_, perform'd his pretended Transmutations of Liquors by the help of\r\ntwo or three inconsiderable preparations and mixtures of not unobvious\r\nLiquors, and chiefly of an Infusion of Brazil variously diluted and made\r\nPale or Yellowish, (and otherwise alter'd) with Vinegar, the rest of their\r\nwork being perform'd by the shape of the Glasses, by Craft and Legerdemane.\r\nAnd for my part, that which I marvel at in this business, is, the Drinkers\r\nbeing able to take down so much Water, and spout it out with that violence;\r\nthough Custome and a Vomit seasonably taken before hand, may in some of\r\nthem much facilitate the work. But as for the changes made in the Liquors,\r\nthey were but few and slight in comparison of those, that the being\r\nconversant in Chymical Experiments, and dextrous in applying them to the\r\nTransmuting of Colours, may easily enough enable a man to make, as ev'n\r\nwhat has been newly deliver'd in this, and the foregoing Experiment;\r\nespecially if we add to it the things contained in the XX, the XXXIX and\r\nthe XL. Experiments, may perhaps have already perswaded You.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XLV._\r\n\r\nYou may I presume (_Pyrophilus_) have taken notice, that in this whole\r\nTreatise, I purposely decline (as far as I well can) the mentioning of\r\nElaborate Chymical Experiments, for fear of frighting you by their\r\ntediousness and difficulty; but yet in confirmation of what I have been\r\nnewly telling you about the possibility of Varying the Colours of Liquors,\r\nbetter than the Water-drinkers are wont to do, I shall add, that _Helmont_\r\nused to make a preparation of Steel, which a very Ingenious Chymist, his\r\nSons Friend, whom you know, sometimes employes for a succedaneum to the\r\nSpaw-waters, by Diluting this _Essentia Martis Liquida_ (as he calls it)\r\nwith a due proportion of Water. Now that for which I mention to you this\r\npreparation, (which as he communicated to me, I know he will not refuse to\r\n_Pyrophilus_) is this, that though the Liquor (as I can shew you when you\r\nplease) be almost of the Colour of a German (not an Oriental) Amethyst, and\r\nconsequently remote enough from Green, yet a very few drops being let fall\r\ninto a Large proportion of good Rhenish, or (in want of that) White Wine\r\n(which yet do's not quite so well) immediately turn'd the Liquor into a\r\nlovely Green, as I have not without delight shown several curious Persons.\r\nBy which _Phænomenon_ you may learn, among other things, how requisite it\r\nis in Experiments about the changes of Colours heedfully to mind the\r\nCircumstances of them; for Water will not, as I have purposely try'd,\r\nconcurr to the production of any such Green, nor did it give that Colour to\r\nmoderate Spirit of Wine, wherein I purposely dissolv'd it, and Wine it self\r\nis a Liquor that few would suspect of being able to work suddenly any such\r\nchange in a Metalline preparation of this Nature; and to satisfie my self\r\nthat this new Colour proceeds rather from the peculiar Texture of the Wine,\r\nthan from any greater Acidity, that Rhenish or White-wine (for that may not\r\nabsurdly be suspected) has in comparison of Water; I purposely sharpen'd\r\nthe Solution of this Essence in fair Water, with a good quantity of Spirit\r\nof Salt, notwithstanding which, the mixture acquir'd no Greenness. And to\r\nvary the Experiment a little, I try'd, that if into a Glass of Rhenish Wine\r\nmade Green by this Essence, I dropp'd an Alcalizate Solution, or Urinous\r\nSpirit, the Wine would presently grow Turbid, and of an odd Dirty Colour;\r\nBut if instead of dissolving the Essence in Wine, I dissolv'd it in fair\r\nWater sharpen'd perhaps with a little Spirit of Salt, then either the\r\nUrinous Spirit of Sal Armoniack, or the solution of the fix'd Salt of\r\nPot-ashes would immediately turn it of a Yellowish Colour, the fix'd or\r\nUrinous Salt Precipitating the Vitriolate substance contain'd in the\r\nEssence. But here I must not forget to take notice of a circumstance that\r\ndeserves to be compar'd with some part of the foregoing Experiment, for\r\nwhereas our Essence imparts a Greenness to Wine, but not to Water, the\r\nIndustrious _Olaus Wormius_[23] in his late _Musæum_ tells us of a rare\r\nkind of Turn-Sole which he calls _Bezetta Rubra_ given him by an Apothecary\r\nthat knew not how it was made, whose lovely Redness would be easily\r\ncommunicated to Water, if it were immers'd in it; but scarce to Wine, and\r\nnot at all to Spirit of Wine, in which last circumstance it agrees with\r\nwhat I lately told you of our Essence, notwithstanding their disagreement\r\nin other particulars.\r\n\r\n  [23] Libr. 2do Cap. 34.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XLVI._\r\n\r\nWe have often taken notice, as of a remarkable thing, that Metalls as they\r\nappear to the Eye, before they come to be farther alter'd by other Bodyes,\r\ndo exhibit Colours very different from those which the Fire and the\r\n_Menstruum_, either apart, or both together, do produce in them; especially\r\nconsidering that these Metalline Bodyes are after all these disguises\r\nreducible not only to their former Metalline Consistence and other more\r\nradical properties, but to their Colour too, as if Nature had given divers\r\nMetalls to each of them a double Colour, an _External_, and an _Internal_;\r\nBut though upon a more attentive Consideration of this difference of\r\nColours, it seem'd probable to me, that divers (for I say not all) of those\r\nColours which we have just now call'd _Internal_, are rather produc'd by\r\nthe Coalition of Metalline Particles with those of the Salts, or other\r\nBodyes employ'd to work on them, than by the bare alteration of the parts\r\nof the Metalls themselves: and though therefore we may call the obvious\r\nColours, Natural or Common, & the others Adventitious, yet because such\r\nchanges of Colours, from whatsoever cause they be resolv'd to proceed may\r\nbe properly enough taken in to illustrate our present Subject, we shall not\r\nscruple to take notice of some of them, especially because there are among\r\nthem such as are produc'd without the intervention of Saline _Menstruums_.\r\nOf the Adventitious Colours of Metalline Bodies the Chief sorts seem to be\r\nthese three. The first, such Colours as are produc'd without other\r\nAdditaments by the Action of the fire upon Metalls. The next such as emerge\r\nfrom the Coalition of Metalline Particles with those of some _Menstruum_\r\nimploy'd to Corrode a Metall or Precipitate it; And the last, The Colours\r\nafforded by Metalline Bodyes either Colliquated with, or otherwise\r\nPenetrating into, other Bodies, especially fusible ones. But these\r\n(_Pyrophilus,_) are only as I told you, the _Chief_ sorts of the\r\nadventitious Colours of Metalls, for there may others belong to them, of\r\nwhich I shall hereafter have occasion to take notice of some, and of which\r\nalso there possibly may be others that I never took notice of.\r\n\r\nAnd to begin with the first sort of Colours, 'tis well enough known to\r\nChymists, that Tin being Calcin'd by fire alone is wont to afford a White\r\n_Calx_, and Lead Calcin'd by fire alone affords that most Common Red-Powder\r\nwe call _Minium:_ Copper also Calcin'd _per se_, by a long or violent fire,\r\nis wont to yield (as far as I have had occasion to take notice of it) a\r\nvery Dark or Blackish Powder; That Iron likewise may by the Action of\r\nReverberated flames be turn'd into a Colour almost like that of Saffron,\r\nmay be easily deduc'd from the Preparation of that Powder, which by reason\r\nof its Colour and of the Metall 'tis made of is by Chymists call'd, _Crocus\r\nMartis per se_. And that _Mercury_ made by the stress of Fire, may be\r\nturn'd into a Red Powder, which Chymists call Precipitate _per se_, I\r\nelsewhere more particularly declare.\r\n\r\n_Annotation I._\r\n\r\nIt is not unworthy the Admonishing you, (_Pyrophilus_,) and it agrees very\r\nwell with our Conjectures about the dependence of the change of a Body's\r\nColour upon that of its Texture, that the same Metall may by the successive\r\noperation of the fire receive divers Adventitious Colours, as is evident in\r\nLead, which before it come to so deep a Colour as that of _Minium_, may\r\npass through divers others.\r\n\r\n_Annotation II_.\r\n\r\nNot only the _Calces_, but the Glasses of Metalls, Vitrify'd _per se_, may\r\nbe of Colours differing from the Natural or Obvious Colour of the Metall;\r\nas I have observ'd in the Glass of Lead, made by long exposing Crude Lead\r\nto a violent fire, and what I have observ'd about the Glass or Slagg of\r\nCopper, (of which I can show you some of an odd kind of Texture,) may be\r\nelsewhere more conveniently related. I have likewise seen a piece of very\r\nDark Glass, which an Ingenious Artificer that show'd it me profess'd\r\nhimself to have made of Silver alone by an extreme _Violence_ (which seems\r\nto be no more than is needfull) of the fire.\r\n\r\n_Annotation III_.\r\n\r\nMinerals also by the Action of the Fire may be brought to afford Colours\r\nvery differing from their own, as I not long since noted to you about the\r\nvariously Colour'd Flowers of Antimony, to which we may add the Whitish\r\nGrey-Colour of its _Calx_, and the Yellow or Reddish Colour of the Glass,\r\nwhere into that _Calx_ may be flux'd.\r\n\r\nAnd I remember, that I elsewhere told you, that Vitriol Calcin'd with a\r\nvery gentle heat, and afterwards with higher and higher degrees of it, may\r\nbe made to pass through several Colours before it descends to a Dark\r\nPurplish Colour, whereto a strong fire is wont at length to reduce it. But\r\nto insist on the Colours produc'd by the Operation of fire upon several\r\nMinerals would take up farr more time than I have now to spare.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XLVII._\r\n\r\nThe Adventitious Colours produc'd upon Metalls, or rather with them, by\r\nSaline Liquors, are many of them so well known to Chymists, that I would\r\nnot here mention them, but that besides a not un-needed Testimony, I can\r\nadd something of my own, to what I shall repeat about them, and divers\r\nExperiments which are familiar to Chymists, are as yet unknown to the\r\ngreatest part of Ingenious Men.\r\n\r\nThat Gold dissolv'd in _Aqua Regia_ ennobles the _Menstruum_ with its own\r\nColour, is a thing that you cannot (_Pyrophilus_,) but have often seen. The\r\nSolutions of Mercury in _Aqua-fortis_ are not generally taken notice of, to\r\ngive any notable Tincture to the _Menstruum_; but sometimes when the Liquor\r\nfirst falls upon the Quick Silver, I have observ'd a very remarkable,\r\nthough not durable, Greenness, or Blewness to be produc'd, which is a\r\n_Phænomenon_ not unfit for you to consider, though I have not now the\r\nleisure to discourse upon it. Tin Corroded by _Aqua-fortis_ till the\r\n_Menstruum_ will work no farther on it, becomes exceeding White, but as we\r\nelsewhere note, does very easily of it self acquire the consistence, not of\r\na Metalline _Calx_, but of a Coagulated matter, which we have observ'd with\r\npleasure to look so like, either to curdled Milk, or curdled Whites of\r\nEggs, that a person unacquainted with such Solutions may easily be mistaken\r\nin it. But when I purposely prepar'd a _Menstruum_ that would dissolve it\r\nas _Aqua-fortis_ dissolves Silver, and not barely Corrode it, and quickly\r\nlet it fall again, I remember not that I took notice of any particular\r\nColour in the Solution, as if the more Whitish Metalls did not much Tinge\r\ntheir _Menstruums_, though the conspicuously Colour'd Metalls as Gold, and\r\nCopper, do. For Lead dissolv'd in Spirit of Vinegar or _Aqua-fortis_ gives\r\na Solution cleer enough, and if the _Menstruum_ be abstracted appears\r\neither Diaphanous or White. Of the Colour of Iron we have elsewhere said\r\nsomething: And 'tis worth noting, that though if that Metall be dissolv'd\r\nin oyl of Vitriol diluted with water, it affords a Salt or Magistery so\r\nlike in colour, as well as some other Qualities, to other green Vitriol,\r\nthat Chymists do not improperly call it _Vitriolum Martis_; yet I have\r\npurposely try'd, that, by changing the _Menstruum_, and pouring upon the\r\nfilings of Steel, instead of oyl of Vitriol, _Aqua Fortis_, (whereof as I\r\nremember, I us'd 4 parts to one of the Metall) I obtain'd not a Green, but\r\na Saffron Colour Solution; or rather a thick Liquor of a deep but yellowish\r\nRed. Common Silver, such as is to be met with in Coines, being dissolv'd in\r\n_Aqua fortis_, yields a Solution tincted like that of Copper, which is not\r\nto be wondred at, because in the coining of Silver, they are wont (as we\r\nelsewhere particularly inform you) to give it an Allay of Copper, and that\r\nwhich is sold in shops for refined silver, is not (so far as we have tryed)\r\nso perfectly free from that ignobler Metall, but that a Solution of It in\r\n_Aqua fortis_, will give a Venereal Tincture to the _Menstruum_. But we\r\ncould not observe upon the solution of some Silver, which was perfectly\r\nrefin'd, (such as some that we have, from which 8 or 10 times its weight of\r\nLead has been blown off) that the _Menstruum_ though held against the Light\r\nin a Crystal Vial did manifestly disclose any Tincture, only it seem'd\r\nsometimes not to be quite destitute of a little, but very faint\r\nBlewishness.\r\n\r\nBut here I must take notice, that of all the Metalls, there is not any\r\nwhich doth so easily and constantly disclose its unobvious colour as Copper\r\ndoth. For not only in acid _Menstruums_ as _Aqua Fortis_ and Spirit of\r\nVinegar, it gives a Blewish green solution, but if it be almost any way\r\ncorroded, it _appears of one of those_ two colours, as may be observ'd in\r\nVerdigreese made several wayes, in that odd preparation of _Venus_, which\r\nwe elsewhere teach you to make with Sublimate, and in the common Vitriols\r\nof _Venus_ deliver'd by Chymists; and so constant is the disposition of\r\nCopper, notwithstanding the disguise Artists put upon it, to disclose the\r\ncolour we have been mentioning, that we have by forcing it up with _Sal\r\nArmoniack_ obtain'd a Sublimate of a Blewish Colour. Nay a famous Spagyrist\r\naffirms, that the very Mercury of it is green, but till he teach us an\r\nintelligible way of making such a Mercury, we must content ourselves to\r\ninform you, that we have had a Cupreous Body, that was Præcipitated out of\r\na distill'd Liquor, that seem'd to be the the Sulphur of _Venus_, and\r\nseem'd even when flaming, of a Greenish Colour. And indeed Copper is a\r\nMetall so easily wrought upon by Liquors of several kinds, that I should\r\ntell you, I know not any Mineral, that will concurr to the production of\r\nsuch a variety of Colours as Copper dissol'd in several _Menstruums_, as\r\nSpirit of Vinegar, _Aqua fortis_, _Aqua Regis_, Spirit of Nitre, of Urine,\r\nof Soot, Oyls of several kinds, and I know not how many other Liquors, if\r\nthe variety of somewhat differing colours (that Copper will be made to\r\nassume, as it is wrought upon by several Liquors) were not comprehended\r\nwithin the Limits of Greenish Blew, or Blewish Green.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I must advertise you (_Pyrophilus_) that being desirous to try if I\r\ncould not make with crude Copper a Green Solution without the Blewishness\r\nthat is wont to accompany its Vulgar Solutions, I bethought my self of\r\nusing two _Menstruums_, which I had not known imploy'd to work on this\r\nMetall, and which I had certain Reasons to make Tryal of, as I successfully\r\ndid. The one of these Liquors (if I much misremember not) was Spirit of\r\nSugar distill'd in a Retort, which must be warily done, (if you will avoid\r\nbreaking your glasses) and the other, Oyl or Spirit of Turpentine, which\r\naffords a fine Green Solution that is useful to me on several occasions.\r\nAnd yet to shew that the adventitious colour may result, as well from the\r\ntrue and permanent Copper it self, as the Salts wherewith 'tis corroded, I\r\nshall add, that if you take a piece of good _Dantzick_ Copperis, or any\r\nother Vitriol wherein _Venus_ is prædominant, and having moistened it in\r\nyour Mouth, or with fair water, rubb it upon a whetted knife, or any other\r\nbright piece of Steel or Iron, it will (as we have formerly told you)\r\npresent'y stain the Steel with a Reddish colour, like that of Copper, the\r\nreason of which, we must not now stay to inquire.\r\n\r\n_Annotation I._\r\n\r\nI presume you may have taken notice (_Pyrophilus_) that I have borrowed\r\nsome of the Instances mention'd in this 47th Experiment, from the\r\nLaboratories of Chymists, and because in some (though very few) other\r\npassages of this Essay, I have likewise made use of Experiments mention'd\r\nalso by some Spagyrical Writers, I think it not amiss to represent to you\r\non this Occasion once for all, some things besides those which I intimated\r\nin the præamble of this present Experiment; For besides, that 'tis very\r\nallowable for a Writer to repeat an Experiment which he invented not, in\r\ncase he improve it; And besides that many Experiments familiar to Chymists\r\nare unknown to the generality of Learned Men, who either never read\r\nChymical processes, or never understood their meaning, or never durst\r\nbelieve them; besides these things, I say, I shall represent, That, as to\r\nthe few Experiments I have borrowed from the Chymists, if they be very\r\nVulgar, 'twould perhaps be difficult to ascribe each of them its own\r\nAuthor, and 'tis more than the generality of Chymists themselves can do:\r\nand if they be not of very known and familiar practise among them, unless\r\nthe Authors wherein I found them had given me cause to believe, themselves\r\nhad try'd them, I know not why I might not set them down, as a part of the\r\n_Phænomena_ of Colours which I present you; Many things unanimously enough\r\ndeliver'd as matters of fact by (I know not how many Chymical Writers)\r\nbeing not to be rely'd on, upon the single Authority of such Authors: For\r\nInstance, as some Spagyrists deliver (perhaps amongst several deceitful\r\nprocesses) that _Saccarum Saturni_ with Spirit of Turpentine will afford a\r\nBalsom, so _Beguinus_ and many more tell us, that the same Concrete\r\n(_Saccarum Saturni_) will yield an incomparably fragrant Spirit, and a\r\npretty Quantity of two several Oyles, and yet since many have complain'd,\r\nas well as I have done, that they could find no such odoriferous, but\r\nrather an ill-sented Liquor, and scarce any oyl in their Distillation of\r\nthat sweet Vitriol, a wary person would as little build any thing on what\r\nthey say of the former Experiment, as upon what they averr of the later,\r\nand therefore I scrupled not to mention this Red Balsom of which I have not\r\nseen any, (but what I made) among my other experiments about redness.\r\n\r\n_Annot. II._\r\n\r\nWe have sometimes had the Curiosity to try what Colours Minerals, as\r\nTinglass, Antimony, Spelter, &c. would yield in several _Menstruums_, nor\r\nhave we forborn to try the Colours of stones, of which that famous one,\r\n(which _Helmont_ calls _Paracelsus's Ludus_) though it be digg'd out of the\r\nEarth and seem a true stone, has afforded in _Menstruums_ capable to\r\ndissolve so solid a stone, sometimes a Yellowish, sometimes a Red solution\r\nof both which I can show you. But though I have from Minerals obtain'd with\r\nseveral _Menstruums_ very differing Colours, and some such as perhaps you\r\nwould be surpriz'd to see drawn from such Bodies: yet I must now pass by\r\nthe particulars, being desirous to put an End to this Treatise, before I\r\nput an end to your Patience and my own.\r\n\r\n_Annotation III._\r\n\r\nAnd yet before I pass to the next Experiment, I must put you in mind, that\r\nthe Colours of Metals may in many cases be further alter'd by imploying,\r\neither præcipitating Salts, or other convenient Substances to act upon\r\ntheir Solutions. Of this you may remember, that I have given you several\r\nInstances already, to which may be added such as these, That if Quicksilver\r\nbe dissolv'd in _Aqua fortis_, and Præcipitated out of the Solution, either\r\nwith water impregnated with Sea salt, or with the spirit of that Concrete,\r\nit falls to the Bottom in the form of a white powder, whereas if it be\r\nPræcipitated with an Alcaly, it will afford a Yellowish or tawny powder,\r\nand if there be no Præcipitation made, and the _Menstruum_ be drawn off\r\nwith a convenient fire, the corroded Mercury will remain in the bottom, in\r\nthe form of a substance that may be made to appear of differing Colours by\r\ndiffering degrees of Heat; As I remember that lately having purposely\r\nabstracted _Aqua fortis_ from some Quicksilver that we had dissolv'd in it,\r\nso that there remain'd a white _Calx_, exposing that to several degrees of\r\nFire, and afterwards to a naked one, we obtain'd some new Colours, and at\r\nlength the greatest part of the _Calx_ lying at the Bottome of the Vial,\r\nand being brought partly to a Deep Yellow, and partly to a Red Colour, the\r\nrest appear'd elevated to the upper part and neck of the Vial, some in the\r\nform of a Reddish, and some of an Ash-Colour Sublimate. But of the\r\ndiffering Colours which by differing wayes and working of Quick Silver with\r\nFire, and Saline Bodies, may be produc'd in Precipitates, I may elsewhere\r\nhave occasion to take further notice. I also told you not long since, that\r\nif you corrode Quick-silver with Oyl of Vitriol instead of _Aqua-fortis_,\r\nand abstract the _Menstruum_, there will remain a White _Calx_ which by the\r\nAffusion of Fair Water presently turns into a Lemmon Colour. And ev'n the\r\n_Succedaneum_ to a _Menstruum_ may sometimes serve the turn to change the\r\nColours of a Metal. The lovely Red which Painters call Vermillion, is made\r\nof Mercury, which is of the Colour of Silver, and of Brimstone which is of\r\nKin to that of Gold, Sublim'd up together in a certain proportion, as is\r\nvulgarly known to Spagyrists.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XLVIII._\r\n\r\nThe third chief sort of the Adventitious Colours of Metals, is, that which\r\nis produc'd by associating them (especially when Calcin'd) with other\r\nfusible Bodies, and Principally Venice, and other fine Glass devoid of\r\nColour.\r\n\r\nI have formerly given you an Example, whereby it may appear, that a Metal\r\nmay impart to Glass a Colour much differing from its own, when I told you,\r\nhow with Silver, I had given Glass a lovely Golden Colour. And I shall now\r\nadd, that I have Learn'd from one of the Chief Artificers that sells\r\nPainted Glass, that those of his Trade Colour it Yellow with a preparation\r\nof the _Calx_ of Silver. Though having lately had occasion among other\r\nTryals to mingle a few grains of Shell-silver (such as is imploy'd with the\r\nPensil and Pen) with a convenient proportion of powder'd Crystal Glass,\r\nhaving kept them two or three hours in fusion, I was surpriz'd to find the\r\nColliquated Mass to appear upon breaking the Crucible of a lovely Saphirine\r\nBlew, which made me suspect my Servant might have brought me a wrong\r\nCrucible, but he constantly affirm'd it to be the same wherein the Silver\r\nwas put, and considerable Circumstances countenanc'd his Assertion, so that\r\ntill I have opportunity to make farther Tryal, I cannot but suspect, either\r\nthat Silver which is not (which is not very probable) brought to a perfect\r\nFusion and Colliquation with Glass, may impart to it other Colours than\r\nwhen Neal'd upon it, or else (which is less unlikely) that though Silver\r\nBeaters usually chuse the finest Coyn they can get, as that which is most\r\nextensive under the Hammer, yet the Silver-leaves of which this Shel-silver\r\nwas made, might retain so much Copper as to enable it to give the\r\npredominant tincture to the Glass.\r\n\r\nFor, I must proceed to tell you (_Pyrophilus_) as another instance of the\r\nAdventitious Colours of Metals, that which is something strange, Namely,\r\nThat though Copper Calcin'd _per se_ affords but a Dark and basely Colour'd\r\n_Calx_, yet the Glassmen do with it, as themselves inform me, Tinge their\r\nGlass green. And I remember, that when once we took some crude Copper, and\r\nby frequent Ignition quenching it in Water had reduc'd it to a Dark and\r\nIll-colour'd Powder, and afterward kept it in Fusion in about a 100. times\r\nits weight of fine Glass, we had, though not a Green, yet a Blew colour'd\r\nMass, which would perhaps have been Green, if we had hit right upon the\r\nProportion of the Materials, and the Degree of Fire, and the Time wherein\r\nit ought to be kept in Fusion, so plentifully does that Metal abound in a\r\nVenerial Tincture, as Artists call it, and in so many wayes does it\r\ndisclose that Richness. But though Copper do as we have said give somewhat\r\nnear the like Colour to Glass, which it does to _Aqua-fortis_, yet it seems\r\nworth inquiry, whether those new Colours which Mineral Bodies disclose in\r\nmelted Glass, proceed from the Coalition of the Corpuscles of the Mineral\r\nwith the Particles of the Glass as such, or from the Action (excited or\r\nactuated by fire) of the Alcalizate Salt (which is a main Ingredient of\r\nGlass,) upon the Mineral Body, or from the concurrence of both these\r\nCauses, or else from any other. But to return to that which we were saying,\r\nwe may observe that _Putty_ made by calcining together a proportion of Tin\r\nand Lead, as it is it self a White _Calx_, so does it turn the _Pitta di\r\nCrystallo_ (as the Glassmen call the matter of the Purer sort of Glass,\r\nwherewith it is Colliquated into a White Mass, which if it be opacous\r\nenough is employ'd, as we elsewhere declare, for White Amel. But of the\r\nColours which the other Metals may be made to produce in Colourless Glass,\r\nand other Vitrifiable Bodies, that have native Colours of their own, I must\r\nleave you to inform your self upon Tryal, or at least must forbear to do it\r\ntill another time, considering how many Annotations are to follow, upon\r\nwhat has in this and the two former Experiments been said already.\r\n\r\n_Annotation I._\r\n\r\nWhen the Materials of Glass being melted with Calcin'd Tin, have compos'd a\r\nMass Undiaphanous and White, this White Amel is as it were the Basis of all\r\nthose fine Concretes that Goldsmiths and several Artificers imploy in the\r\ncurious Art of Enamelling. For this White and Fusible substance will\r\nreceive into it self, without spoyling them, the Colours of divers other\r\nMineral substances, which like it will indure the fire.\r\n\r\n_Annotation II._\r\n\r\nSo that as by the present (XLVIII.) Experiment it appears, that divers\r\nMinerals will impart to fusible Masses, Colours differing from their own;\r\nso by the making and compounding of Amels, it may appear, that divers\r\nBodies will both retain their Colour in the fire, and impart the _same_ to\r\nsome others wherewith they were vitrifi'd, and in such Tryals as that\r\nmention'd in the 17. Experiment, where I told you, that ev'n in Amels a\r\nBlew and Yellow will compound a Green. 'Tis pretty to behold, not only that\r\nsome Colours are of so fix'd a Nature, as to be capable of mixture without\r\nreceiving any detriment by the fire, that do's so easily destroy or spoyl\r\nthose of other Bodies; but Mineral Pigments may be mingled by fire little\r\nless regularly and successfully, than in ordinary Dyeing Fatts, the vulgar\r\nColours are wont to be mingled by the help of Water.\r\n\r\n_Annotation III._\r\n\r\n'Tis not only Metalline, but other Mineral Bodies, that may be imploy'd, to\r\ngive Tinctures unto Glass (and 'tis worth noting how small a quantity of\r\nsome Mineral substances, will Tinge a Comparatively vast proportion of\r\nGlass, and we have sometimes attempted to Colour Glass, ev'n with Pretious\r\nStones, and had cause to think the Experiment not cast away. And 'tis known\r\nby them that have look'd into the Art of Glass, that the Artificers use to\r\ntinge their Glass Blew, with that Dark Mineral _Zaffora_, (some of my\r\nTryals on which I elsewhere acquaint you) which some would have to be a\r\nMineral Earth, others a Stone, and others neither the one, nor the other,\r\nbut which is confessedly of a Dark, but not a Blew Colour, though it be not\r\nagreed of what particular Colour it is. 'Tis likewise though a familiar yet\r\na remarkable practise among those that Deal in the making of Glass, to\r\nimploy (as some of themselves have inform'd me) what they call Manganess,\r\nand some Authors call _Magnesia_ (of which I make particular mention in\r\nanother Treatise) to exhibit in Glass not only other Colours than its own,\r\n(which is so like in Darkness or blackishness to the Load stone, that 'tis\r\ngiven by Mineralists, for one of the Reasons of its Latine Name) but\r\nColours differing from one another. For though they use it, (which is\r\nsomewhat strange) to Clarifye their Glass, and free it from that Blewish\r\nGreenish Colour, which else it would too often be subject to, yet they also\r\nimploy it in certain proportions, to tinge their Glass both with a Red\r\ncolour, and with a Purplish or Murry, and putting in a greater Quantity,\r\nthey also make with it that deep obscure Glass which is wont to pass for\r\nBlack, which agrees very well with, and may serve to confirm what we noted\r\nnear the beginning of the 44th Experiment, of the seeming Blackness of\r\nthose Bodies that are overcharg'd with the Corpuscles of such Colours, as\r\nRed, or Blew, or Green, &c. And as by several Metals and other Minerals we\r\ncan give various Colours to Glass, so on the other side, by the differing\r\nColours that Mineral Oars, or other Mineral Powders being melted with Glass\r\ndisclose in it, a good Conjecture may be oftentimes made of the Metall or\r\nknown Mineral, that the Oar propos'd, either holds, or is most of kin to.\r\nAnd this easie way of examining Oars, may be in some cases of good use, and\r\nis not ill deliver'd by _Glauber_, to whom I shall at present refer you,\r\nfor a more particular account of it: unless your Curiosity command also\r\nwhat I have observ'd about these matters; only I must here advertise you,\r\nthat great circumspection is requisite to keep this way from proving\r\nfallacious, upon the account of the variations of Colour that may be\r\nproduc'd by the differing proportions that may be us'd betwixt the Oar and\r\nthe Glass, by the Richness or Poorness of the Oar it self, by the Degree of\r\nFire, and (especially) by the Length of Time, during which the matter is\r\nkept in fusion; as you will easily gather from what you will quickly meet\r\nwith in the following Annotation upon this present 48th Experiment.\r\n\r\n_Annotation IV._\r\n\r\nThere is another way and differing enough from those already mention'd, by\r\nwhich Metalls may be brought to exhibit adventitious Colours: For by This,\r\nthe Metall do's not so much impart a Colour to another Body, as receive a\r\nColour from it, or rather both Bodies do by the new Texture resulting from\r\ntheir mistion produce a new Colour. I will not insist to this purpose upon\r\nthe Examples afforded us by yellow Orpiment, and common Sea Salt, from\r\nwhich, sublim'd together, Chymists unanimously affirm their White or\r\nCrystalline Arsenick to be made: But 'tis not unworthy our noting, That\r\nthough Yellow Orpiment be acknowledg'd to be the Copiousest by far of the\r\ntwo Ingredients of Arsenick, yet this last nam'd Body being duely added to\r\nthe highest Colour'd Metall Copper, when 'tis in fusion, gives it a\r\nwhiteness both within and without. Thus _Lapis Calaminaris_ changes and\r\nimproves the Colour of Copper by turning it into Brass. And I have\r\nsometimes by the help of Zinck duely mix'd after a certain manner, given\r\nCopper one of the Richest Golden Colours that ever I have seen the Best\r\ntrue Gold Ennobled with. But pray have a care that such Hints fall not into\r\nany hands that may mis-imploy them.\r\n\r\n_Annotation V._\r\n\r\nUpon the Knowledge of the differing wayes of making Minerals and Metalls\r\nproduce their adventitious Colours in Bodies capable of Vitrification,\r\ndepends the pretty Art of making what Chymists by a Barbarous Word are\r\npleas'd to call _Amanses_, that is counterfeit, or factitious Gemms, as\r\nEmeralds, Rubies, Saphires, Topazes, and the like. For in the making of\r\nthese, though pure Sand or Calcin'd Crystal give the Body, yet 'tis for the\r\nmost part some Metalline or Mineral _Calx_, mingled in a small proportion\r\nthat gives the Colour. But though I have many years since taken delight, to\r\ndivert my self with this pleasing Art, and have seen very pretty\r\nProductions of it, yet besides that I fear I have now forgot most of the\r\nlittle Skill I had in it, this is no place to entertain you with what would\r\nrather take up an intire Discourse, than be comprehended in an Annotation;\r\nwherefore the few things which I shall here take notice of to you, are only\r\nwhat belong to the present Argument, Namely,\r\n\r\nFirst, That I have often observ'd that Calcin'd Lead Colliquated with fine\r\nWhite Sand or Crystal, reduc'd by ignitions and subsequent extinctions in\r\nWater to a subtile Powder, will of it self be brought by a due Decoction to\r\ngive a cleer Mass Colour'd like a _German_ Amethyst. For though this glass\r\nof Lead, is look'd upon by them that know no better way of making\r\n_Amanses_, as the grand Work of them all, yet which is an inconvenience\r\nthat much blemishes this way, the Calcin'd Lead it self does not only\r\nafford matter to the _Amanses_, but has also as well as other Metals a\r\nColour of its own, which as I was saying, I have often found to be like\r\nthat of _German_ (as many call them) not Eastern Amethysts.\r\n\r\nSecondly, That nevertheless this Colour may be easily over-powr'd by those\r\nof divers other Mineral Pigments (if I may so call them) so that with a\r\nglass of Lead, you may Emulate (for Instance) the fresh and lovely\r\nGreenness of an Emerald, though in divers cases the Colour which the Lead\r\nit self upon Vitrification tends to, may vitiate that of the Pigment, which\r\nyou would introduce into the Mass.\r\n\r\nThirdly, That so much ev'n these Colours depend upon Texture, that in the\r\nGlass of Lead it self made of about three parts of _Lytharge_ or _Minium_\r\nColliquated with one of very finely Powder'd Crystal or Sand, we have taken\r\npleasure to make the mixture pass through differing Colours, as we kept it\r\nmore or less in the Fusion. For it was not usually till after a pretty long\r\nDecoction that the Mass attain'd to the Amethystin Colour.\r\n\r\nFourthly and lastly, That the degrees of Coction and other Circumstances\r\nmay so vary the Colour produc'd in the same mass, that in a Crucible that\r\nwas not great I have had fragments of the same Mass, in some of which\r\nperhaps not so big as a Hazel-Nut, you may discern four distinct Colours.\r\n\r\n_Annotation VI._\r\n\r\nYou may remember (_Pyrophilus_) that when I mention'd the three sorts of\r\nadventitious Colours of Metals, I mention'd them but as the chief, not the\r\nonly. For there may be other wayes, which though they do not in so strict a\r\nsense belong to the adventitious Colours of Metals, may not inconveniently\r\nbe reduc'd to them. And of these I shall name now a couple, without denying\r\nthat there may be more.\r\n\r\nThe first may be drawn from the practise of those that Dye Scarlet. For the\r\nfamousest Master in that Art, either in _England_ or _Holland_, has\r\nconfess'd to me, that neither others, nor he can strike that lovely Colour\r\nwhich is now wont to be call'd the _Bow-Dye_, without their Materials be\r\nBoyl'd in Vessels, either made of, or lin'd with a particular Metall. But\r\nof what I have known attempted in this kind, I must not as yet for fear of\r\nprejudicing or displeasing others give you any particular Account.[24]\r\n\r\nThe other way (_Pyrophilus_) of making Metals afford unobvious Colours, is\r\nby imbuing divers Bodies with Solutions of them made in their proper\r\n_Menstruum's_, As (for Instance) though Copper plentifully dissolv'd in\r\n_Aqua fortis_, will imbue several Bodies with the Colour of the Solution;\r\nYet Some other Metalls will not (as I elsewhere tell you) and have often\r\ntry'd. Gold dissolv'd in _Aqua Regia_, will, (which is not commonly known)\r\nDye the Nails and Skin, and Hafts of Knives, and other things made of\r\nIvory, not with a Golden, but a Purple Colour, which though it manifest it\r\nself but slowly, is very durable, and scarce ever to be wash'd out. And if\r\nI misremember not, I have already told you in this Treatise, that the purer\r\nCrystals of fine Silver made with _Aqua fortis_, though they appear White,\r\nwill presently Dye the Skin and Nails, with a Black, or at least a very\r\nDark Colour, which Water will not wash off, as it will ordinary Ink from\r\nthe same parts. And divers other Bodies may the Same way be Dy'd, some of a\r\nBlack, and others of a Blackish Colour.\r\n\r\n  [24] See the latter end of the fiftieth Experiment.\r\n\r\nAnd as Metalline, so likewise Mineral Solutions may produce Colours\r\ndiffering enough from those of the Liquors themselves. I shall not fetch an\r\nExample of this, from what we daily see happen in the powdring of Beef,\r\nwhich by the Brine imploy'd about it (especially if the flesh be over\r\nsalted) do's oftentimes appear at our Tables of a Green, and sometimes of a\r\nReddish Colour, (deep enough) nor shall I insist on the practise of some\r\nthat deal in Salt Petre, who, (as I suspected, and as themselves\r\nacknowledg'd to me) do, with the mixture of a certain proportion of that;\r\nand common Salt, give a fine Redness, not only to Neats Tongues, but which\r\nis more pretty as well as difficult, to such flesh, as would otherwise be\r\npurely White; These Examples, I say, I shall decline insisting on, as\r\nchusing rather to tell you, that I have several times try'd, that a\r\nSolution of the Sulphur of Vitriol, or ev'n of common Sulphur, though the\r\nLiquor appear'd clear enough, would immediately tinge a piece of new Coin,\r\nor other clean Silver, sometimes with a Golden, sometimes with a deeper,\r\nand more Reddish colour, according to the strength of the Solution, and the\r\nquantity of it, that chanc'd to adhere to the Metall; which may take off\r\nyour wonder that the water of the hot Spring at _Bath_, abounding with\r\ndissolv'd Substances of a very Sulphureous Nature, should for a while, as\r\nit were gild, the new or clean pieces of Silver coyn, that are for a due\r\ntime immers'd in it. And to these may be added those formerly mention'd\r\nExamples of the adventitious Colours of Mineral Bodies; which brings into\r\nmy mind, that, ev'n Vegetable Liquors, whether by degeneration, or by\r\naltering the Texture of the Body that imbibes them, may stain other Bodies\r\nwith Colours differing enough, from their own, of which very good\r\nHerbarists have afforded us a notable Example, by affirming that the Juice\r\nof _Alcanna_ being green (in which state I could never here procure it)\r\ndo's yet Dye the Skin and Nails of a Lasting Red. But I see this Treatise\r\nis like to prove too bulky without the addition of further Instances of\r\nthis Nature.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT XLIX._\r\n\r\nMeeting the other day, _Pyrophilus_, in an _Italian_ book, that treats of\r\nother matters, with a way of preparing what the Author calls a _Lacca_ of\r\nVegetables, by which the _Italians_ mean a kind of Extract fit for\r\nPainting, like that rich _Lacca_ in English commonly call'd _Lake_, which\r\nis imploy'd by Painters as a glorious Red. And finding the Experiment not\r\nto be inconsiderable, and very defectively set down, it will not be amiss\r\nto acquaint you with what some Tryals have inform'd us, in reference to\r\nthis Experiment, which both by our Italian Author, and by divers of his\r\nCountrymen, is look'd upon as no trifling Secret.\r\n\r\nTake then the root call'd in Latin _Curcuma_, and in English Turmerick,\r\n(which I made use of, because it was then at hand, and is among Vegetables\r\nfit for that purpose one of the most easiest to be had) and when it is\r\nbeaten, put what Quantity of it you please into fair Water, adding to every\r\npound of Water about a spoonfull or better of as strong a _Lixivium_ or\r\nSolution of Potashes as you can well make, clarifying it by Filtration\r\nbefore you put it to the Decocting water. Let these things boyl, or rather\r\nsimper over a soft Fire in a clean glaz'd Earthen Vessel, till you find by\r\nthe Immersion of a sheet of White Paper (or by some other way of Tryal)\r\nthat the Liquor is sufficiently impregnated with the Golden Tincture of the\r\nTurmerick, then take the Decoction off the Fire, and Filter or Strain it\r\nthat it may be clean, and leisurely dropping into it a strong Solution of\r\nRoch Allum, you shall find the Decoction as it were curdl'd, and the\r\ntincted part of it either to emerge, to subside, or to swim up and down,\r\nlike little Yellow flakes; and if you pour this mixture into a Tunnel lin'd\r\nwith Cap Paper, the Liquor that Filtred formerly so Yellow, will now pass\r\nclean thorow the Filtre, leaving its tincted, and as it were curdled parts\r\nin the Filtre, upon which fair Water must be so often pour'd, till you have\r\nDulcifi'd the matter therein contain'd, the sign of which Dulcification is\r\n(you know) when the Water that has pass'd through it, comes from it as\r\ntasteless as it was pour'd on it. And if without Filtration you would\r\ngather together the flakes of this Vegetable Lake, you must pour a great\r\nQuantity of fair Water upon the Decoction after the affusion of the\r\nAlluminous Solution, and you shall find the Liquor to grow clearer, and the\r\nLake to settle together at the bottom, or emerge to the top of the Water,\r\nthough sometimes having not pour'd out a sufficient Quantity of fair Water,\r\nwe have observ'd the Lake partly to subside, and partly to emerge, leaving\r\nall the middle of the Liquor clear. But to make this Lake fit for use, it\r\nmust by repeated affusions of fresh Water, be Dulcifi'd from the adhering\r\nSalts, as well as that separated by Filtration, and be spread and suffer'd\r\nto dry leisurely upon pieces of Cloth, with Brown Paper, or Chalk, or\r\nBricks under them to imbibe the Moisture[25].\r\n\r\n                                                                [Page 372]\r\n_Annotation I._\r\n\r\nWhereas it is presum'd that the Magistery of Vegetables obtain'd this way\r\nconsists but of the more Soluble and Coloured parts of the Plants that\r\nafford it, I must take the liberty to Question the supposition. And for my\r\nso doing, I shall give you this account.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Notions (such as they were) that I had concerning Salts;\r\nAllom, though to sense a Homogeneous Body, ought not to be reckon'd among\r\ntrue Salts, but to be it self look'd upon as a kind of Magistery, in regard\r\nthat as Native Vitriol (for such I have had) contains both a Saline\r\nsubstance and a Metall, whether Copper, or Iron, corroded by it, and\r\nassociated with it; so Allom which may be of so near a kin to Vitriol, that\r\nin some places of _England_ (as we are assur'd by good Authority the same\r\nstone will sometimes afford both) seems manifestly to contain a peculiar\r\nkind of Acid Spirit, generated in the Bowels of the Earth, and some kind of\r\nstony matter dissolv'd by it. And though in making our ordinary Allom, the\r\nWorkmen use the Ashes of a Sea Weed (vulgarly call'd Kelp) and Urine: yet\r\nthose that should know, inform us, that, here in _England_, there is\r\nbesides the factitious Allom, Allom made by Nature Without the help of\r\nthose Additaments. Now (_Pyrophilus_) when I consider'd this composition of\r\nAllom, and that Alcalizate Salts are wont to Præcipitate what acid Salts\r\nhave dissolv'd, I could not but be prone to suspect that the Curdled\r\nMatter, which is call'd the Magistery of Vegetables, may have in it no\r\ninconsiderable proportion of a stony substance Præcipitated out of the\r\nAllom by the _Lixivium_, wherein the Vegetable had been decocted, and to\r\nshew you, that there is no necessity, that all the curdl'd substance must\r\nbelong to the Vegetable, I shall add, that I took a strong Solution of\r\nAllom, and having Filtred it, by pouring in a convenient Quantity of a\r\nstrong Solution of Potashes, I presently, as I expected, turn'd the mixture\r\ninto a kind of white Curds, which being put to Filtre, the Paper retain'd a\r\nstony _Calx_, copious enough, very White, and which seem'd to be of a\r\nMineral Nature, both by some other signes, and this, that little Bits of it\r\nbeing put upon a live Coal, which was Gently Blown whilst they were on it,\r\nthey did neither melt nor fly away, and you may keep a Quantity of this\r\nWhite substance for a good while, (nay for ought I can guess for a very\r\nlong one) in a red hot Crucible without losing or spoiling it; nor did hot\r\nWater wherein I purposely kept another parcel of such _Calx_, seem to do\r\nany more than wash away the looser adhering Salts from the stony substance,\r\nwhich therefore seem'd unlikely to be separable by ablutions (though\r\nreiterated) from the Præcipitated parts of the Vegetable, whose Lake is\r\nintended. And to shew you, that there is likewise in Allom a Body, with\r\nwhich the fix'd Salt of the Alcalizate Solution will concoagulate into a\r\nSaline Substance differing from either of them, I shall add, that I have\r\ntaken pleasure to recover out of the slowly exhal'd Liquor, that pass'd\r\nthrough the filtre, and left the foremention'd _Calx_ behind, a Body that\r\nat least seem'd a Salt very pretty to look on, as being very White, and\r\nconsisting of an innumerable company of exceeding slender, and shining\r\nParticles, which would in part easily melt at the flame of a Candle, and in\r\npart flye away with some little noise. But of this substance, and its odd\r\nQualities more perhaps elsewhere; for now I shall only take notice to you,\r\nthat I have likewise with Urinous Salts, such as the Spirit of Sal\r\nArmoniack, as well as with the Spirit of Urine it self, Nay, (if I much\r\nmistake not) ev'n with Stale Urine undistil'd, easily Precipitated such a\r\nWhite _Calx_ as I was formerly speaking of, out of a Limpid Solution of\r\nAllom, so that there is need of Circumspection in judging of the Natures of\r\nLiquors by Precipitations wherein Allom intervenes, else we may sometimes\r\nmistakingly imagine that to be Precipitated out of a Liquor by Allom, which\r\nis rather Precipitated out of Allom by the Liquor: And this puts me in mind\r\nto tell you, that 'tis not unpleasant to behold how quickly the Solution of\r\nAllom (or injected lumps of Allom) do's occasion the severing of the\r\ncolour'd parts of the Decoction from the Liquor that seem'd to have so\r\nperfectly imbib'd them.\r\n\r\n  [25] _The Curious Reader that desires further Information concerning\r\n  Lakes, may Resort to the 7th Book of_ Neri's _Art of Glass, Englished (6\r\n  or 7 years since the Writing of this 49th Experiment) and Illustrated\r\n  with Learned Observations, by the Inquisitive and experienc'd Dr._\r\n  Charles Merret.\r\n\r\n_Annot. II._\r\n\r\nThe above mention'd way of making Lakes we have tryed not only with\r\nTurmerick, but also with Madder, which yielded us a Red Lake; and with Rue,\r\nwhich afforded us an extract, of (almost if not altogether) the same Colour\r\nwith that of the leaves.\r\n\r\nBut in regard that 'tis Principally the Alcalizate Salt of the Pot-ashes,\r\nwhich enables the water to Extract so powerfully the Tincture of the\r\nDecocted Vegetables, I fear that our Author may be mistaken by supposing\r\nthat the Decoction will alwayes be of the very same Colour with the\r\nVegetable it is made off. For Lixiviate Salts, to which Pot-ashes eminently\r\nbelong, though by peircing and opening the Bodies of Vegetables, they\r\nprepare and dispose them to part readily with their Tincture, yet some\r\nTinctures they do not only draw out, but likewise alter them, as may be\r\neasily made appear by many of the Experiments already set down in this\r\nTreatise, and though Allom being of an Acid Nature, its Solutions may in\r\nsome Cases destroy the Adventitious Colours produc'd by the Alcaly, and\r\nrestore the former: yet besides that Allom is not, as I have lately shown,\r\na meer Acid Salt, but a mixt Body, and besides, that its operations are\r\nlanguid in comparison of the activity of Salts freed by Distillation, or by\r\nIncineration and Dissolution, from the most of their Earthy parts, we have\r\nseen already Examples, that in divers Cases an Acid Salt will not restore a\r\nVegetable substance to the Colour of which an Alcalizate one had depriv'd\r\nit, but makes it assume a third very differing from both, as we formerly\r\ntold you, that if Syrrup of Violets were by an Alcaly turn'd Green, (which\r\nColour, as I have try'd, may be the same way produc'd in the Violet-leaves\r\nthemselves without any Relation to a Syrrup) an Acid Salt would not make it\r\nBlew again, but Red. And though I have by this way of making Lakes, made\r\nMagisteries (for such they seem to be) of Brazil, and as I remember of\r\nCochinele it self, and of other things, Red, Yellow or Green which Lakes\r\nwere enobled with a Rich Colour, and others had no bad one; yet in some the\r\ncolour of the Lake seem'd rather inferiour than otherwise to that of the\r\nPlant, and in others it seem'd both very differing, and much worse; but\r\nWriting this in a time and place where I cannot provide my self of Flowres\r\nand other Vegetables to prosecute such Tryals in a competent variety of\r\nSubjects, I am content not to be positive in delivering a judgment of this\r\nway of Lakes, till Experience, or You, _Pyrophilus_, shall have afforded me\r\na fuller and more particular Information.\r\n\r\n_Annotation III._\r\n\r\nAnd on this occasion (_Pyrophilus_) I must here (having forgot to do it\r\nsooner) advertise you once for all, that having written several of the\r\nforegoing Experiments, not only in haste but at seasons of the year, and in\r\nplaces wherein I could not furnish my self with such Instruments, and such\r\na variety of Materials, as the design of giving you an Introduction into\r\nthe History of Colours requir'd, it can scarce be otherwise but that divers\r\nof the Experiments, that I have set down, may afford you some matter of new\r\nTryals, if you think fit to supply the deficiencies of some of them\r\n(especially the freshly mention'd about Lakes, and those that concern\r\nEmphatical Colours) which deficiencies for want of being befriended with\r\naccommodations I could better discern than avoid.\r\n\r\n_Annotation IV._\r\n\r\nThe use of Allom is very great as well as familiar in the Dyers Trade, and\r\nI have not been ill pleas'd with the use I have been able to make of it in\r\npreparing other pigments than those they imploy with Vegetable Juices. But\r\nthe Lucriferous practises of Dyers and other Tradesmen, I do, for Reasons\r\nthat you may know when you please, purposely forbear in this Essay, though\r\nnot strictly from pointing at, yet from making it a part of my present work\r\nexplicitly and circumstantially to deliver, especially since I now find\r\n(though late and not without some Blushes at my prolixity) that what I\r\nintended but for a short Essay, is already swell'd into almost a Volume.\r\n\r\n_EXPERIMENT L._\r\n\r\nYet here, _Pyrophilus_, I must take leave to insert an Experiment, though\r\nperhaps you'l think its coming in here an Intrusion, For I confess its more\r\nproper place would have been among those Experiments, that were brought as\r\nproofs and applications of our Notions concerning the differences of Salts;\r\nbut not having remembred to insert it in its fittest place, I had rather\r\ntake notice of it in this, than leave it quite unmention'd: partly because\r\nit doth somewhat differ from the rest of our Experiments about Colours, in\r\nthe way whereby 'tis made; and partly because the grounds upon which I\r\ndevis'd it, may hint to you somewhat of the Method I use in Designing and\r\nVarying Experiments about Colours, and upon this account I shall inform\r\nyou, not only What I did, but Why I did it.\r\n\r\nI consider'd then that the work of the former Experiments was either to\r\nchange the Colour of a Body into another, or quite to destroy it, without\r\ngiving it a successor, but I had a mind to give you also a way, whereby to\r\nturn a Body endued with one Colour into two Bodies, of Colours, as well as\r\nconsistencies, very distinct from each other, and that by the help of a\r\nBody that had it self no Colour at all. In order to this, I remembred, that\r\nfinding the Acidity of Spirit of Vinegar to be wholly destroy'd by its\r\nworking upon _Minium_ (or calcin'd Lead) whereby the Saline particles of\r\nthe _Menstruum_ have their Taste and Nature quite alter'd, I had, among\r\nother Conjectures I had built upon that change, rightly concluded, that the\r\nSolution of Lead in Spirit of Vinegar would alter the Colour of the Juices\r\nand Infusions of Several Plants, much after the like manner that I had\r\nfound Oyl of Tartar to do; and accordingly I was quickly satisfied upon\r\nTryal, that the Infusion of Rose-leaves would by a small quantity of this\r\nSolution well mingl'd with it, be immediately turn'd into a somewhat sad\r\nGreen.\r\n\r\nAnd further, I had often found, that Oyl of Vitriol, though a potently Acid\r\n_Menstruum_, will yet Præcipitate many Bodies, both Mineral and others,\r\ndissolv'd not onely in _Aqua fortis_ (as some Chymists have observ'd) but\r\nparticularly in Spirit of Vinegar, and I have further found, that the\r\n_Calces_ or Powders Præcipitated by this Liquor were usually fair and\r\nWhite.\r\n\r\nLaying these things together, 'twas not difficult to conclude, that if upon\r\na good Tincture of Red Rose-leaves made with fair Water, I dropp'd a pretty\r\nquantity of a strong and sweet Solution of _Minium_, the Liquor would be\r\nturn'd into the like muddy Green Substance, as I have formerly intimated to\r\nYou, that Oyl of Tartar would reduce it to, and that if then I added a\r\nconvenient quantity of good Oyl of Vitriol, this last nam'd Liquor would\r\nhave two distinct operations upon the Mixture, the one, that it would\r\nPræcipitate that resolv'd Lead in the form of a White Powder; the other,\r\nthat it would Clarifie the muddy Mixture, and both restore, and exceedingly\r\nheighten the Redness of the Infusion of Roses, which was the most copious\r\nIngredient of the Green composition, and accordingly trying the Experiment\r\nin a Wine glass sharp at the bottom (like an inverted Cone) that the\r\nsubsiding Powder might seem to take up the more room, and be the more\r\nconspicuous, I found that when I had shaken the Green Mixture, that the\r\ncolour'd Liquor might be the more equally dispersed, a few drops of the\r\nrectifi'd Oyl of Vitriol did presently turn the opacous Liquor into one\r\nthat was cleer and Red, almost like a Rubie, and threw down good store of a\r\nPowder, which when 'twas settl'd, would have appear'd very White, if some\r\ninterspers'd Particles of the red Liquor had not a little Allay'd the\r\nPurity, though not blemish'd the Beauty of the Colour. And to shew you,\r\n_Pyrophilus_, that these Effects do not flow from the Oyl of Vitriol, as it\r\nis such, but as it is a strongly Acid _Menstruum_, that has the property\r\nboth to Præcipitate Lead, as well as some other Concretes out of Spirit of\r\nVinegar, and to heighten the Colour of Red Rose-leaves, I add, that I have\r\ndone the same thing, though perhaps not quite so well with Spirit of Salt,\r\nand that I could not do it with _Aqua-fortis_, because though that potent\r\n_Menstruum_ does as well as the others heighthen the Redness of Roses, yet\r\nit would not like them Precipitate Lead out of Spirit of Vinegar, but would\r\nrather have dissolv'd it, if it had not found it dissolv'd already.\r\n\r\nAnd as by this way we have produc'd a Red Liquor, and a White Precipitate\r\nout of a Dirty Green magistery of Rose-leaves, so by the same Method, you\r\nmay produce a fair Yellow, and sometimes a Red Liquor, and the like\r\nPrecipitate, out of an Infusion of a curious Purple Colour. For you may\r\ncall to mind, that in the Annotation upon the 39th. Experiment I intimated\r\nto you, that I had with a few drops of an Alcaly turn'd the Infusion of\r\nLogg-wood into a lovely Purple. Now if instead of this Alcaly I substituted\r\na very Strong and well Filtrated Solution of _Minium_, made with Spirit of\r\nVinegar, and put about half as much of this Liquor as there was of the\r\nInfusion of Logg-wood, (that the mixture might afford a pretty deal of\r\nPrecipitate,) the affusion of a convenient proportion of Spirit of Salt,\r\nwould (if the Liquors were well and nimbly stirr'd together) presently\r\nstrike down a Precipitate like that formerly mention'd, and turn the Liquor\r\nthat swam above it, for the most part into a lovely Yellow.\r\n\r\nBut for the advancing of this Experiment a little further, I consider'd,\r\nthat in case I first turn'd a spoonfull of the infusion of Logg-wood\r\nPurple, by a convenient proportion of the Solution of _Minium_, the\r\nAffusion of Spirit of Sal Armnoniack, would Precipitate the Corpuscles of\r\nLead conceal'd in the Solution of _Minium_, and yet not destroy the Purple\r\ncolour of the Liquor; whereupon I thus proceeded; I took about a spoonfull\r\nof the _fresh_ Tincture of Logg-wood, (for I found that if it were _stale_\r\nthe Experiment would not alwayes succeed,) and having put to it a\r\nconvenient proportion of the Solution of _Minium_ to turn it into a deep\r\nand almost opacous Purple, I then drop'd in as much Spirit of Sal\r\nArmoniack, as I guess'd would Precipitate about half or more (but not all)\r\nof the Lead, and immediately stirring the mixture well together, I mingled\r\nthe Precipitated parts with the others, so that they fell to the bottom,\r\npartly in the form of a Powder, and partly in the form of a Curdled\r\nSubstance, that (by reason of the Predominancy of the Ting'd Corpuscles\r\nover the White) retain'd as well as the Supernatant Liquor; a Blewish\r\nPurple colour sufficiently Deep, and then instantly (but yet Warily,)\r\npouring on a pretty Quantity of Spirit of Salt, the matter first\r\nPrecipitated, was, by the above specified figure of the bottome of the\r\nGlass preserv'd from being reach'd by the Spirituous Salt; which hastily\r\nPrecipitated upon it a new Bed (if I may so call it) of White Powder, being\r\nthe remaining Corpuscles of the Lead, that the Urinous Spirit had not\r\nstruck down: So that there appear'd in the Glass three distinct and very\r\ndifferingly colour'd Substances; a Purple or Violet-colour'd Precipitate at\r\nthe bottom, a White and Carnation (sometimes a Variously colour'd)\r\nPrecipitate over That, and at the Top of all a Transparent Liquor of a\r\nlovely Yellow, or Red.\r\n\r\nThus you see, _Pyrophilus_, that though to some I may have seem'd to have\r\nlighted on this (50th.) Experiment by chance, and though others may\r\nimagine, that to have excogitated it, must have proceeded from some\r\nextraordinary insight into the nature of Colours, yet indeed, the devising\r\nof it need not be look'd upon as any great matter, especially to one that\r\nis a little vers'd in the notions, I have in these, and other Papers hinted\r\nconcerning the differences of Salts. And perhaps I might add upon more than\r\nconjecture, that these very notions and some particulars scatteringly\r\ndeliver'd in this Treatise, being skilfully put together, may suggest\r\ndivers matters (at least,) about Colours, that will not be altogether\r\nDespicable. But those hinted, _Pyrophilus_, I must now leave such as You to\r\nprosecute, having already spent farr more time than I intended to allow my\r\nself in acquainting You with particular Experiments and Observations\r\nconcerning the changes of Colour, to which I might have added many more,\r\nbut that I hope I may have presented You with a competent number to make\r\nout in some measure what I have at the beginning of this Essay either\r\npropos'd as my Design in this Tract, or deliver'd as my Conjectures\r\nconcerning these matters. And it not being my present Designe, as I have\r\nmore than once Declar'd, to deliver any Positive Hypothesis or solemn\r\nTheory of Colours, but only to furnish You with some Experiments towards\r\nthe framing of such a Theory; I shall add nothing to what I have said\r\nalready, but a request that you would not be forward to think I have been\r\nmistaken in any thing I have deliver'd as matter of Fact concerning the\r\nchanges of Colours, in case you should not every time you trye it, find it\r\nexactly to succeed. For besides the Contingencies to which we have\r\nelsewhere shewn some other Experiments to be obnoxious, the omission or\r\nvariation of a seemingly unconsiderable circumstance, may hinder the\r\nsuccess of an Experiment, wherein no other fault has been committed. Of\r\nwhich truth I shall only give you that single and almost obvious, but yet\r\nillustrious instance of the Art of Dying Scarlets, for though you should\r\nsee every Ingredient that is us'd about it, though I should particularly\r\ninform You of the weight of each, and though you should be present at the\r\nkindling of the fire, and at the increasing and remitting of it, when ever\r\nthe degree of Heat is to be alter'd, and though (in a word) you should see\r\nevery thing done so particularly that you would scarce harbour the least\r\ndoubt of your comprehending the whole Art: Yet if I should not disclose to\r\nYou, that the Vessels, that immediately contain the Tinging Ingredients,\r\nare to be made of or to be lin'd with Tin, You would never be able by all\r\nthat I could tell you else (at-least, if the Famousest and Candidest\r\nArtificers do not strangely delude themselves) to bring your Tincture of\r\nChochinele to Dye a perfect Scarlet. So much depends upon the very Vessel,\r\nwherein the Tinging matters are boyl'd, and so great an Influence may an\r\nunheeded Circumstance have on the Success of Experiments concerning\r\nColours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    _FINIS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      A SHORT\r\n                      ACCOUNT\r\n                      OF SOME\r\n                    OBSERVATIONS\r\n                Made by Mr. _BOYLE_\r\n\r\n   About a _Diamond_ that _Shines_ in the Dark.\r\n\r\n      First enclosed in a Letter written to\r\n                      a Friend,\r\n\r\nAnd now together with it annexed to the Foregoing\r\n         Treatise, upon the score of the\r\n                   Affinity Betwixt\r\n                _Light_ and _Colours_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                     _LONDON,_\r\n\r\n      Printed for _Henry Herringman_. 1664\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                     A COPY\r\n                     OF THE\r\n                     LETTER\r\n\r\n That Mr. _Boyle_ wrote to Sir _Robert Morray_,\r\n   to accompany the _Observations_ touching\r\n             the _Shining Diamond_.\r\n\r\n_SIR,_\r\n\r\nThough Sir _Robert Morray_ and Monsieur _Zulichem_ be Persons that have\r\ndeserv'd so well of the Commonwealth of Learning, that I should think my\r\nself unworthy to be look'd upon as a Member of it, if I declin'd to Obey\r\nthem, or to Serve them; yet I should not without Reluctancy send you the\r\nNotes, you desire for him, if I did not hope that you will transmit\r\ntogether with them, some Account why they are not less unworthy of his\r\nperusal; which, that you may do; I must inform you, how the writing of them\r\nwas Occasion'd, which in short was thus. As I was just going out of Town,\r\nhearing that an Ingenious Gentleman of my Acquaintance, lately return'd\r\nfrom _Italy_, had a Diamond, that being rubb'd, would shine in the Dark,\r\nand that he was not far off, I snatch'd time from my Occasions to make him\r\na Visit, but finding him ready to go abroad, and having in vain try'd to\r\nmake the Stone yield any Light in the Day time, I borrow'd it of him for\r\nthat Night, upon condition to restore it him within a Day or two at\r\nfurthest, at _Gresham_ College, where we appointed to attend the meeting of\r\nthe Society, that was then to be at that place. And hereupon I hasted that\r\nEvening out of Town, and finding after Supper that the Stone which in the\r\nDay time would afford no discernable Light, was really Conspicuous in the\r\nDark, I was so taken with the Novelty, and so desirous to make some use of\r\nan opportunity that was like to last so little a while, that though at that\r\ntime I had no body to assist me but a Foot-Boy, yet sitting up late, I made\r\na shift that Night to try a pretty number of such of the things that then\r\ncame into my thoughts, as were not in that place and time unpracticable.\r\nAnd the next Day being otherwise imploy'd, I was fain to make use of a\r\ndrowsie part of the Night to set down hastily in Writing what I had\r\nobserv'd, and without having the time in the Morning, to stay the\r\ntranscribing of it, I order'd the Observations to be brought after me to\r\n_Gresham_ College, where you may remember, that they were together with the\r\nStone it self shown to the Royal Society, by which they had the good\r\nFortune not to be dislik'd, though several things were through hast\r\nomitted, some of which you will find in the Margin of the inclosed Paper.\r\nThe substance of this short Narrative I hope you will let Monsieur\r\n_Zulichem_ know, that he may be kept from expecting any thing of finish'd\r\nin the Observations, and be dispos'd to excuse the want of it. But such as\r\nthey are, I hope they will prove (without a Clinch) Luciferous Experiments,\r\nby setting the Speculations of the Curious on work, in a diligent Inquiry\r\nafter the Nature of Light, towards the discovery of which, perhaps they\r\nhave not yet met with so considerable an Experiment, since here we see\r\nLight produc'd in a dead and opacous Body, and that not as in rotten Wood,\r\nor in Fishes, or as in the _Bolonian_ Stone, by a Natural Corruption, or by\r\na Violent Destruction of the Texture of the Body, but by so slight a\r\nMechanical operation upon its Texture, as we seem to know what it is, and\r\nas is immediately perform'd, and that several wayes without at all\r\nprejudicing the Body, or making any sensible alterations in its Manifest\r\nQualities. And I am the more willing to expose my hasty Tryals to Monsieur\r\n_Zulichem_, and to You, because, he being upon the Consideration of\r\nDioptricks, so odd a _Phænomenon_ relateing to the Subject, as probably he\r\ntreats of, Light will, I hope, excite a person to consider it, that is wont\r\nto consider things he treats of very well. And for you Sir, I hope you will\r\nboth recrute and perfect the Observations you receive, For you know that I\r\ncannot add to them, having a good while since restor'd to Mr. _Clayton_ the\r\nStone, which though it be now in the hands of a Prince that so highly\r\ndeserves, by understanding them, the greatest Curiosities; yet he\r\nvouchsafes you that access to him as keeps me from doubting, you may easily\r\nobtain leave to make further Tryals with it, of such a Monarch as ours,\r\nthat is not more inquisitive himself, than a favourer of them that are so.\r\nI doubt not but these Notes will put you in mind of the Motion you made to\r\nthe Society, to impose upon me the Task of bringing in, what I had on other\r\noccasions observ'd concerning shining Bodies. But though I deny not, that I\r\nsometimes made observations about the _Bolonian_ Stone, and try'd some\r\nExperiments about some other shining Bodies; Yet the same Reasons that\r\nreduc'd me then to be unwilling to receive ev'n their commands, must now be\r\nmy Apology for not answering your Expectations, Namely the abstruse nature\r\nof Light, and my being already over-burden'd, and but too much kept\r\nimploy'd by the Urgency of the Press, as well as by more concerning and\r\ndistracting Occasions. But yet I will tell you some part of what I have met\r\nwith in reference to the Stone, of which I send you an account. Because I\r\nfind on the one side, that a great many think it no Rarity upon a mistaken\r\nperswasion, that not only there are store of Carbuncles, of which this is\r\none; but that all Diamonds and other Glistering Jewels shine in the Dark.\r\nWhereas on the other side there are very Learn'd Men, who (plausibly\r\nenough) deny that there are any Carbuncles or shining Stones at all.\r\n\r\nAnd certainly, those Judicious men have much more to say for themselves,\r\nthan the others commonly Plead, and therefore did deservedly look upon Mr.\r\n_Clayton_'s Diamond as a great Rarity. For not only _Boetius de Boot_, who\r\nis judg'd the best Author on this Subject, ascribes no such Virtue to\r\nDiamonds, but begins what he delivers of Carbuncles, with this passage.[26]\r\n_Magna fama est Carbunculi. Is vulgo putatur in tenebris Carbonis instar\r\nlucere; fortassis quia Pyropus seu Anthrax appellatus a veteribus fuit.\r\nVerum hactenus nemo nunquam verè asserere ausus fuit, se gemmam noctu\r\nlucentem vidisse. Garcias ab Horto proregis Indiæ Medicus, refert se\r\nallocutum fuisse, qui se vidisse affirmarent. Sed iis fidem non habuit._\r\nAnd a later Author, the Diligent and Judicious _Johannes de Laet_ in his\r\nChapter of Carbuncles and of Rubies, has this passage. _Quia autem\r\nCarbunculi, Pyropi & Anthraces a veteribus nominantur, vulgo creditum fuit,\r\nCarbonis instar in tenebris lucere, quod tamen nullâ gemmâ hastenus\r\ndeprehensum, licet à quibusdam temerè jactetur._ And the recentest Writer I\r\nhave met with on this Subject, _Olaus Wormius_, in his Account of his well\r\nfurnish'd _Musæum_, do's, where he treats of Rubies, concurr with the\r\nformer Writers by these Words.[27] _Sunt qui Rubinum veterum Carbunculum\r\nesse existimant, sed deest una illa nota, quod in tenebris instar Anthracis\r\nnon luceat: Ast talem Carbunculum in rerum naturâ non inveniri major pars\r\nAuthoram existimant. Licet unum aut alterum in India apud Magnates quosdam\r\nreperiri scribant, cum tamen ex aliorum relatione id habeant saltem, sed\r\nipsi non viderint._ In confirmation of which I shall only add, that hearing\r\nof a Rubie, so very Vivid, that the Jewellers themselves have several times\r\nbegg'd leave of the fair Lady to whom it belong'd, that they might try\r\ntheir choicest Rubies by comparing them with That, I had the Opportunity by\r\nthe Favour of this Lady and her Husband, (both which I have the Honour to\r\nbe acquainted with) to make a Trial of this famous Rubie in the Night, and\r\nin a Room well Darkn'd, but not only could not discern any thing of Light,\r\nby looking on the Stone before any thing had been done to it, but could not\r\nby all my Rubbing bring it to afford the least Glimmering of Light.\r\n\r\n  [26] Boetius de Boot. Gem. & Lapid. Histor. Lib. 3. Cap. 8.\r\n\r\n  [27] Musæi Wormiani. Cap. 17.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, though I be very backward to admit strange things for truths, yet\r\nI am not very forward to reject them as impossibilities, and therefore I\r\nwould not discourage any from making further Inquiry, whether or no there\r\nbe Really in _Rerum natura_, any such thing as a true Carbuncle or Stone\r\nthat without Rubbing will shine in the Dark. For if such a thing can be\r\nfound, it may afford no small Assistance to the Curious in the\r\nInvestigation of Light, besides the Nobleness and Rarity of the thing it\r\nselfe. And though _Vartomannus_ was not an Eye witness of what he relates,\r\nthat the King of _Pegu_, one of the Chief Kings of the _East-Indies_, had a\r\ntrue Carbuncle of that Bigness and Splendour, that it shin'd very\r\nGloriously in the Dark, and though _Garcias ab Horto_, the _Indian_\r\nVice-Roys Physician, speaks of another Carbuncle, only upon the Report of\r\none, that he Discours'd with, who affirmed himself to have seen it; yet as\r\nwe are not sure that these Men that gave themselves out to be Eye-witnesses\r\nspeak true, yet they may have done so for ought we know to the contrary.\r\nAnd I could present you with a much considerabler Testimony to the same\r\npurpose, if I had the permission of a Person concern'd, without whose leave\r\nI must not do it. I might tell you that _Marcus Paulus Venetus_[28] (whose\r\nsuppos'd Fables, divers of our later Travellours and Navigatours have since\r\nfound to be truths) speaking of the King of _Zeilan_ that then was, tells\r\nus, that he was said to have the best Rubie in the World, a Palm long and\r\nas big as a mans Arm, without spot, shining like a Fire, and he subjoyns,\r\nthat the Great _Cham_, under whom _Paulus_ was a considerable Officer, sent\r\nand offer'd the value of a City for it; But the King answer'd, he would not\r\ngive it for the treasure of the World, nor part with it, having been his\r\nAncestours. And I could add, that in the Relation made by two _Russian_\r\nCossacks of their Journey into _Catay_[29], written to their Emperour, they\r\nmention'd their having been told by the people of those parts, that their\r\nKing had a Stone, which Lights as the Sun both Day and Night, call'd in\r\ntheir Language _Sarra_, which those Cossacks interpret a Ruby. But these\r\nRelations are too uncertain for me to build any thing upon, and therefore I\r\nshall proceed to tell you, that there came hither about two years since out\r\nof _America_, the Governour of one of the Principal Colonies there, an\r\nAncient _Virtuoso_, and one that has the Honour to be a member of the Royal\r\nSociety; this Gentleman finding some of the chief Affairs of his Country\r\ncommitted to another and me, made me divers Visits, and in one of them when\r\nI enquir'd what Rare Stones they had in those parts of the _Indies_ he\r\nbelong'd to, he told me, that the _Indians_ had a Tradition that in a\r\ncertain hardly accessible Hill, a pretty way up in the Country, there was a\r\nStone which in the Night time shin'd very vividly, and to a great distance,\r\nand he assur'd me, that though he thought it not fit to venture himself so\r\nfar among those Savages, yet he purposely sent thither a bold _Englishman_,\r\nwith some Natives to be his guides, and that this Messenger brought him\r\nback word, that at a distance from the Hillock he had plainly perceiv'd\r\nsuch a shining Substance as the _Indians_ Tradition mention'd, and being\r\nstimulated by Curiosity, had slighted those Superstitious Fears of the\r\nInhabitants, and with much ado by reason of the Difficulty of the way, had\r\nmade a shift to clamber up to that part of the Hill, where, by a very\r\nheedful Observation, he suppos'd himself to have seen the Light: but\r\nwhether 'twere that he had mistaken the place, or for some other Reason, he\r\ncould not find it there, though when he was return'd to his former Station,\r\nhe did agen see the Light shining in the same place where it shone before.\r\nA further Account of this Light I expect from the Gentleman that gave me\r\nthis, who lately sent me the news of his being landed in that Country. And\r\nthough I reserve to my self a full Liberty of Believing no more than I see\r\ncause; yet I do the less scruple to relate this, because a good part of it\r\nagrees well enough with another Story that I shall in the next place have\r\noccasion to subjoyn, in order whereunto I shall tell you, that though the\r\nLearned Authors I formerly mention'd, tell us, that no Writer has affirm'd\r\nhis having himself seen a real Carbuncle, yet, considering the Light of Mr.\r\n_Claytons_ Diamond, it recall'd into my mind, that some years before, when\r\nI was Inquisitive about Stones, I had met with an old _Italian_ Book highly\r\nextoll'd to me by very competent Judges, and that though the Book were very\r\nscarce, I had purchas'd it at a dear Rate, for the sake of a few\r\nconsiderable passages I met with in it, and particularly one, which being\r\nvery remarkable in it self, and pertinent to our present Argument, I shall\r\nput it for you, though not word for word, which I fear I have forgot to do,\r\nyet as to the Sense, into _English_.\r\n\r\n  [28] _Purchas_'s Pilgrim. lib. 1. cap. 4. pag. 104.\r\n\r\n  [29] In the year 1619.\r\n\r\n_Having promis'd_ (Says our Author)[30] _to say something of that most\r\nprecious sort of Jewels,_ Carbuncles, _because they are very rarely to be\r\nmet with, we shall briefly deliver what we know of them. In_ Clement _the\r\nseventh's time, I happen'd to see one of_ _them at a certain_ Ragusian\r\n_Merchants, nam'd_ Beigoio di Bona, _This was a Carbuncle white, of that\r\nkind of whiteness which we said was to be found in those Rubies of which we\r\nmade mention a little above,_ (where he had said that those Rubies had a\r\nkind of Livid Whiteness or Paleness like that of a Calcidonian) _but it had\r\nin it a Lustre so pleasing and so marveilous, that it shin'd in the Dark,\r\nbut not as much as colour'd Carbuncles, though it be true, that in an\r\nexceeding Dark place I saw it shine in the manner of fire almost gone out.\r\nBut as for colour'd Carbuncles, it has not been my Fortune to have seen\r\nany, wherefore I will onely set down what I Learn'd about them Discoursing\r\nin my Youth with a_ Roman _Gentleman of antient Experience in matters of\r\nJewels, who told me, That one_ Jacopo Cola _being by Night in a Vineyard of\r\nhis, and espying something in the midst of it, that shin'd like a little_\r\nglowing Coal, at the foot of a Vine, went near towards the place where he\r\nthought himself to have seen that fire, but not finding it, he said, that\r\nbeing return'd to the same place, whence he had first descry'd it, and\r\nperceiving there the same splendor as before, he mark'd it so heedfully,\r\nthat he came at length to it, where he took up a very little Stone, which\r\nhe carry'd away with Transports and Joy. And the next day carrying it about\r\nto show it divers of his Friends, whilst he was relating after what manner\r\nhe found it, there casually interven'd a _Venetian_ Embassadour,\r\nexceedingly expert in Jewels, who presently knowing it to be a Carbuncle,\r\ndid craftily before he and the said _Jacopo_ parted (so that there was no\r\nBody present that understood the Worth of so Precious a Gemm) purchase it\r\nfor the Value of 10. Crowns, and the next day left _Rome_ to shun the being\r\nnecessitated to restore it, and (as he affirm'd) it was known within some\r\nwhile after that the said _Venetian_ Gentleman did in _Constantinople_ sell\r\nthat Carbuncle to the then Grand Seignior, newly come to the Empire, for a\r\nhundred thousand Crowns. _And this is what I can say_ concerning\r\n_Carbuncles_, and this is not a little at least as to the first part of\r\nthis account, where our _Cellini_ affirms himself to have seen a Real\r\nCarbuncle with his own Eyes, especially since this Author appears wary in\r\nwhat he delivers, and is inclin'd rather to lessen, than increase the\r\nwonder of it. And his Testimony is the more considerable, because though he\r\nwere born a Subject neither to the Pope nor the then King of _France_ (that\r\nRoyal _Virtuoso_ _Francis_ the first) yet both the one and the other of\r\nthose Princes imploy'd him much about making of their Noblest Jewels. What\r\nis now reported concerning a Shining Substance to be seen in one of the\r\nIslands about _Scotland_, were very improper for me to mention to Sr.\r\n_Robert Morray_, to whom the first Information was Originally brought, and\r\nfrom whom I expect a farther (for I scarce dare expect a convincing)\r\naccount of it. But I must not omit that some _Virtuoso_ questioning me the\r\nother day at _White-Hall_ about Mr. _Claytons_ Diamond, and meeting amongst\r\nthem an Ingenious _Dutch_ Gentleman, whose Father was long Embassador for\r\nthe Netherlands in _England_, I Learn'd of him, that, he is acquainted with\r\na person, whose Name he told (but I do not well remember it) who was\r\nAdmiral of the _Dutch_ in the _East-Indies_, and who assur'd this Gentleman\r\n_Monsieur Boreel_, that at his return from thence he brought back with him\r\ninto _Holland_ a Stone, which though it look'd but like a Pale Dull\r\nDiamond, such as he saw Mr. _Claytons_ to be, yet was it a Real Carbuncle,\r\nand did without rubbing shine so much, that when the Admiral had occasion\r\nto open a Chest which he kept under Deck in a Dark place, where 'twas\r\nforbidden to bring Candles for fear of Mischances, as soon as he open'd the\r\nTrunck, the Stone would by its Native Light, shine so as to Illustrate a\r\ngreat part of it, and this Gentleman having very civilly and readily\r\ngranted me the request I made him, to Write to the Admiral, who is yet\r\nalive in _Holland_, (and probably may still have the Jewel by him,) for a\r\nparticular account of this Stone, I hope ere long to receive it, which will\r\nbe the more welcome to me, not onely because so unlikely a thing needs a\r\ncleer evidence, but because I have had some suspition of that (supposing\r\nthe truth of the thing) what may be a shining Stone in a very hot Countrey\r\nas the _East-Indies_, may perhaps cease to be so (at least in certain\r\nseasons,) in one as cold as _Holland_. For I observ'd in the Diamond I send\r\nyou an account of, that not onely rubbing but a very moderate degree of\r\nwarmth, though excited by other wayes, would make it shine a little. And\r\n'tis not impossible that there may be Stones as much more susceptible than\r\nthat, of the Alterations requisite to make a Diamond shine, as that\r\nappeares to be more susceptible of them, than ordinary Diamonds. And I\r\nconfess to you, that this is not the only odd suspition (for they are not\r\nso much as conjectures) that what I try'd upon this Diamond suggested to\r\nme. For not here to entertain you with the changes I think may be effected\r\nev'n in harder sorts of Stones, by wayes not vulgar, nor very promising,\r\nbecause I may elsewhere have occasion to speak of them, and this Letter is\r\nbut too Prolix already, that which I shall now acknowledge to you is, That\r\nI began to doubt whether there may not in some Cases be some Truth in what\r\nis said of the right Turquois, that it often changes Colour as the wearer\r\nis Sick or Well, and manifestly loses its splendor at his Death. For when I\r\nfound that ev'n the warmth of an Affriction that lasted not above a quarter\r\nof a minute, Nay, that of my Body, (whose Constitution you know is none of\r\nthe hottest) would make a manifest change in the solidest of Stones a\r\nDiamond, it seem'd not impossible, that certain warm and Saline steams\r\nissuing from the Body of a living man, may by their plenty or paucity, or\r\nby their peculiar Nature, or by the total absence of them, diversifie the\r\nColour, and the splendor of so soft a Stone as the Turquois. And though I\r\nadmir'd to see, that I know not how many Men otherwise Learn'd, should\r\nconfidently ascribe to Jewels such Virtues as seem no way competible to\r\nInanimate Agents, if to any Corporeal ones at all, yet as to what is\r\naffirm'd concerning the Turquois's changing Colour, I know not well how to\r\nreject the Affirmation of so Learned (and which in this case is much more\r\nconsiderable) so Judicious a Lapidary as _Boetius de Boot_[31], who upon\r\nhis own particular and repeated Experience delivers so memorable a\r\nNarrative of the Turquois's changing Colour, that I cannot but think it\r\nworth your Perusal, especially since a much later and very Experienc'd\r\nAuthor, _Olaus Wormius_,[32] where he treats of that Stone, Confirms it\r\nwith this Testimony. _Imprimis memorandum exemplum quod Anshelmus Boetius\r\nde seipso refert, tam mutati Coloris, quam à casu preservationis. Cui &\r\nipse haud dissimile adferre possum, nisi ex Anshelmo petitum quis putaret._\r\nI remember that I saw two or three years since a _Turcois_ (worn in a Ring)\r\nwherein there were some small spots, which the _Virtuoso_ whose it was\r\nasur'd me he had observ'd to grow sometimes greater sometimes less, and to\r\nbe sometimes in one part of the Stone, sometimes in another. And I having\r\nencourag'd to make Pictures from time to time of the Stone, and of the\r\nSituation of the cloudy parts, thatso their Motion may be more\r\nindisputable, and better observ'd, he came to me about the midle of this\r\nvery week, and assur'd me that he had, as I wish'd, made from time to time\r\nSchemes or Pictures of the differing parts of the Stone, whereby the\r\nseveral Removes and motions of the above mentioned Clouds are very\r\nmanifest, though the cause seem'd to him very occult: these Pictures he has\r\npromis'd to show me, and is very ready to put the Stone it self into my\r\nhands. But the ring having been the other day casually broken upon his\r\nfinger, unless it can be taken out, and set again without any considerable\r\nheat, he is loath to have it medled with, for fear its peculiarity should\r\nbe thereby destroy'd. And possibly his apprehension would have been\r\nstrengthen'd, if I had had opportunity to tell him what is related by the\r\nLearned _Wormius_[33] of an acquaintance of his, that had a _Nephritick_\r\nstone, of whose eminent Virtues he had often Experience ev'n in himself,\r\nand for that cause wore it still about his Wrist; and yet going upon a time\r\ninto a Bath of fair Water only, wherein certain Herbs had been boyl'd, the\r\nStone by being wetted with this decoction, was depriv'd of all his Virtue,\r\nwhence _Wormius_ takes Occasion to advertise the sick, to lay by such\r\nstones whensoever they make use of a Bath. And we might expect to find\r\n_Turcos_ likewise, easily to be wrought upon in point of Colour, if that\r\nwere true, which the curious _Antonio Neri_, in his ingenious _Arte\r\nVetraria_[34] teaches of it, namely, That _Turcois's discolour'd_ and grown\r\nwhite, will regain and acquire an excellent Colour, if you but keep them\r\ntwo or three days at most cover'd with Oyl of sweet Almonds kept in a\r\ntemperate heat by warm ashes, I say if it were true, because I doubt\r\nwhether it be so, and have not as yet had opportunity to satisfie my self\r\nby Tryals, because I find by the confession of the most Skilfull Persons\r\namong whom I have laid out for _Turcoises_, that the true ones are great\r\nrarities, though others be not at all so. And therefore I shall now only\r\nmind you of one thing that you know as well as I, namely, that the rare\r\nStone which is called _Oculus Mundi_, if it be good in its Kind, will have\r\nso great a change made in its Texture by being barely left a while in the\r\nLanguidest of Liquors, common Waters, that from Opacous it will become\r\nTransparent, and acquire a Lustre of which it will again be depriv'd,\r\nwithout using any other Art or Violence, by leaving it a while in the Air.\r\nAnd before experience had satisfy'd us of the truth of this, it seem'd as\r\nunlikely that common Water or Air, should work such great changes in that\r\nGemm, as it now seems that the Effluviums of a human Body should effect\r\nlesser changes in a _Turcois_, especially if more susceptible of them, than\r\nother Stones of the same kind. But both my Watch and my Eyes tell me that\r\n'tis now high time to think of going to sleep, matters of this Nature, will\r\nbe better, as well as more easily, clear'd by Conference, than Writing. And\r\ntherefore since I think you know me too well to make it needfull for me to\r\ndisclame Credulity, notwithstanding my having entertain'd you with all\r\nthese Extravagancies; for you know well, how wide a difference I am wont to\r\nput betwixt things that barely _may be_, and things that _are_, and between\r\nthose Relations that are but not unworthy to be inquir'd into, and those\r\nthat are not worthy to be actually believ'd; without making Apologies for\r\nmy Ravings, I shall readily comply with the drowsiness that calls upon me\r\nto release You, and the rather, because Monsieur _Zulichem_ being concern'd\r\nin your desire to know the few things I have observed about the shining\r\nStone. To entertain those with Suspicions that are accustomed not to\r\nacquiesce but in Demonstrations, were a thing that cannot be look'd upon as\r\nother than very improper by,\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\n_Your most Affectionate_\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n_most Faithfull Servant,_\r\n\r\nRO.

But for\r\n  all my attention I could not discover any peculiarity worth mentioning._\r\n\r\nSecondly, The Candles being removed, I could not in a Dark place discern\r\nthe Stone to have any Light, when I looked on it, without having Rubb'd or\r\notherwise prepar'd it.\r\n\r\nThirdly, By two white Pibbles though hard Rubb'd one against another, nor\r\nby the long and vehement Affriction of Rock Crystal against a piece of Red\r\ncloath, nor yet by Rubbing two Diamonds set in Ring, as I had Rubb'd this\r\nStone, I could produce any sensible degree of Light.\r\n\r\nFourthly, I found this Diamond hard enough, not only to enable me to write\r\nreadily with it upon Glass, but to Grave on Rock Crystal it self.\r\n\r\nFifthly, I found this to have like other Diamonds, an Electrical\r\nfaculty.[38]\r\n\r\n  [38] V. _For it drew light Bodies like Amber, Jet, and other Concretes\r\n  that are noted to do so; But its attractive power seem'd inferiour to\r\n  theirs._\r\n\r\nSixthly, Being rubb'd upon my Cloaths, as is usual for the exciting of\r\nAmber, Wax, and other Electrical Bodies, it did in the Dark manifestly\r\nshine like Rotten Wood, or the Scales of Whitings, or other putrified Fish.\r\n\r\nSeventhly, But this Conspicuousness was Fainter than that of the Scales,\r\nand Slabber (if I may so call it) of Whitings, and much Fainter than the\r\nLight of a Glow-worm, by which I have been sometimes able to Read a short\r\nWord, whereas after an ordinary Affriction of this Diamond I was not able\r\nto discern distinctly by the Light of it any of the nearest Bodies: And\r\nthis Glimmering also did very manifestly and considerably Decay presently\r\nupon the ceasing of the Affriction, though the Stone continued Visible some\r\nwhile after.\r\n\r\nEighthly, But if it were Rubb'd upon a convenient Body for a pretty while,\r\nand Briskly enough, I found the Light would be for some moments much more\r\nconsiderable, almost like the Light of a Glow-worm, insomuch after I ceased\r\nRubbing, I could with the Chaf'd stone exhibit a little Luminous Circle,\r\nlike that, but not so bright as that which Children make by moving a stick\r\nFir'd at the end, and in this case it would continue Visible about seven or\r\neight times as long as I had been in Rubbing it.\r\n\r\nNinthly, I found that holding it a while near[39] the Flame of a Candle,\r\n(from which yet I was carefull to avert my Eyes) and being immediately\r\nremov'd into the Dark, it disclosed some faint Glimmering, but inferiour to\r\nthat, it was wont to acquire by Rubbing. And afterward holding it near a\r\nFire that had but little Flame, I found the Stone to be rather less than\r\nmore excited, than it had been by the Candle.\r\n\r\n  [39] IX. _We durst not hold it in the Flame of a Candle, no more than put\r\n  it into a naked Fire; For fear too Violent a Heat (which has been\r\n  observ'd to spoil many other precious Stones) should vitiate and impair a\r\n  Jewel, that was but borrow'd, and was suppos'd to be the only one of its\r\n  Kind._\r\n\r\nTenthly, I likewise indeavour'd to make it Shine, by holding it a pretty\r\nwhile in a very Dark place, over a thick piece of Iron, that was well\r\nHeated, but not to that Degree as to be Visibly so. And though at length I\r\nfound, that by this way also, the Stone acquired some Glimmering, yet it\r\nwas less than by either of the other ways above mention'd.\r\n\r\nEleventhly, I also brought it to some kind of Glimmering Light, by taking\r\nit into Bed with me, and holding it a good while upon a warm part of my\r\nNaked Body.\r\n\r\nTwelfthly, To satisfie my self, whether the Motion introduc'd into the\r\nStone did generate the Light upon the account of its producing Heat there,\r\nI held it near the Flame of a Candle, till it was qualify'd to shine pretty\r\nwell in the Dark, and then immediately I apply'd a slender Hair to try\r\nwhether it would attract it, but found not that it did so; though if it\r\nwere made to shine by Rubbing, it was as I formerly noted Electrical. And\r\nfor further Confirmation, though I once purposedly kept it so near the hot\r\nIron I just now mention'd, as to make it sensibly Warm, yet it shin'd more\r\nDimly than it had done by Affriction or the Flame of a Candle, though by\r\nboth those ways it had not acquir'd any warmth that was sensible.\r\n\r\nThirteenthly, Having purposely rubb'd it upon several Bodies differing as\r\nto Colour, and as to Texture, there seem'd to be some little Disparity in\r\nthe excitation (if I may so call it) of Light. Upon White and Red Cloths it\r\nseem'd to succeed best, especially in comparison of Black ones.\r\n\r\nFourteenthly, But to try what it would do rubb'd upon Bodies more hard, and\r\nless apt to yield Heat upon a light Affriction, than Cloath, I first rubb'd\r\nit upon a white wooden Box, by which it was excited, and afterwards upon a\r\npiece of purely Glazed Earth, which seem'd during the Attrition to make it\r\nShine better than any of the other Bodies had done, without excepting the\r\nWhite ones, which I add, lest the Effect should be wholly ascrib'd to the\r\ndisposition White Bodies are wont to have to Reflect much Light.\r\n\r\nFifteenthly, Having well excited the Stone, I nimbly plung'd it under\r\nWater[40], that I had provided for that purpose, and perceiv'd it to Shine\r\nwhilst it was beneath the Surface of that Liquor, and this I did divers\r\ntimes. But when I indeavour'd to produce a Light by rubbing it upon the\r\nlately mentioned Cover of the Box, the Stone and it being both held beneath\r\nthe Surface of the Water, I did not well satisfie my self in the Event of\r\nthe Trial; But this I found, if I took the Stone out, and Rubb'd it upon a\r\npiece of Cloath, it would not as else it was wont to do, presently acquire\r\na Luminousness, but needed to be rubb'd manifestly much longer before the\r\ndesired Effect was found.\r\n\r\n  [40] XV. _We likewise Plung'd it as soon as we had excited it, under\r\n  Liquors of several sorts, as Spirit of Wine, Oyl both Chymical and\r\n  express'd, an Acid Spirit, and as I remember an Alcalizate Solution, and\r\n  found not any of those various Liquors to destroy its Shining property._\r\n\r\nSixteenthly, I also try'd several times, that by covering it with my warm\r\nSpittle (having no warm Water at hand) it did not lose his Light.[41]\r\n\r\n  [41] XVI. _Having found by this Observation, that a warm Liquor would not\r\n  extinguish Light in the Diamond, I thought fit to try, whether by reason\r\n  of its warmth it would not excite it, and divers times I found, that if\r\n  it were kept therein, till the Water had leisure to communicate some of\r\n  its Heat to it, it would often shine as soon as it was taken out, and\r\n  probably we should have seen it Shine more, whilst it was in the Water,\r\n  if some degree of Opacity which heated Water is wont to acquire, upon the\r\n  score of the Numerous little Bubbles generated in it, had not kept us\r\n  from discerning the Lustre of the Stone._\r\n\r\nSeventeenthly, Finding that by Rubbing the Stone with the Flat side\r\ndownwards, I did by reason of the Opacity of the Ring; and the sudden Decay\r\nof Light upon the ceasing of the Attrition, probably lose the sight of the\r\nStones greatest Vividness; and supposing that the Commotion made in one\r\npart of the stone will be easily propagated all over, I sometimes held the\r\npiece of Cloath upon which I rubb'd it, so, that one side of the Stone was\r\nexposed to my Eye, whilst I was rubbing the other, whereby it appear'd more\r\nVivid than formerly, and to make Luminous Tracts by its Motions too and\r\nfro. And sometimes holding the Stone upwards, I rubb'd its Broad side with\r\na fine smooth piece of Transparent Horn, by which means the Light through\r\nthat Diaphanous Substance, did whilst I was actually rubbing the Stone,\r\nappear so Brisk that sometimes and in some places it seem'd to have little\r\nSparks of fire.\r\n\r\nEighteenthly, I took also a piece of flat Blew Glass, and having rubb'd the\r\nDiamond well upon a Cloath, and nimbly clapt the Glass upon it, to try\r\nwhether in case the Light could peirce it, it would by appearing Green, or\r\nof some other Colour than Blew, assist me to guess whether it self were\r\nsincere or no. But finding the Glass impervious to so faint a Light, I then\r\nthought it fit to try whether that hard Bodies would not by Attrition\r\nincrease the Diamonds Light so as to become penetrable thereby, and\r\naccordingly when I rubb'd the Glass briskly upon the Stone, I found the\r\nLight to be Conspicuous enough, and somewhat Dy'd in its passage, but found\r\nit not easie to give a Name to the Colour it exhibited.\r\n\r\nLastly, To comply with the Suspition I had upon the whole Matter, that the\r\nchief manifest Change wrought in the Stone, was by Compression of its\r\nparts, rather than Incalescence, I took a piece of white Tile well Glaz'd,\r\nand if I press'd the Stone hard against it, it seem'd though I did not rub\r\nit to and fro, to shine at the Sides: And however it did both very\r\nmanifestly and vigorously Shine, if whilst I so press'd it, I mov'd it any\r\nway upon the Surface of the Tile, though I did not make it draw a Line of\r\nabove a quarter of an Inch long, or thereabouts. And though I made it not\r\nmove to and fro, but only from one end of the short Line to the other,\r\nwithout any return or Lateral motion. Nay, after it had been often rubb'd,\r\nand suffer'd to lose its Light again, not only it seem'd more easie to be\r\nexcited than at the beginning of the Night; but if I did press hard upon it\r\nwith my Finger, at the very instant that I drew it briskly off, it would\r\ndisclose a very Vivid but exceeding short Liv'd Splendour, not to call it a\r\nlittle Coruscation.[42] So that a _Cartesian_ would scarce scruple to think\r\nhe had found in this Stone no slight Confirmation of his Ingenious Masters\r\n_Hypothesis_, touching the Generation of Light in Sublunary Bodies, not\r\nsensibly Hot.\r\n\r\n  [42] _I after bethought my self of imploying a way, which produc'd the\r\n  desir'd Effect both sooner and better. For holding betwixt my Fingers a\r\n  Steel Bodkin, near the Lower part of it, I press'd the point hard against\r\n  the Surface of the Diamond, and much more if I struck the point against\r\n  it, the Coruscation would be extremely suddain, and very Vivid, though\r\n  very Vanishing too, and this way which commonly much surpris'd and\r\n  pleas'd the Spectators, seem'd far more proper than the other, to show\r\n  that pressure alone, if forcible enough, though it were so suddain, and\r\n  short, that it could not well be suppos'd to give the Stone any thing\r\n  near a sensible degree of Warmth, as may be suspected of Rubbing, yet\r\n  'tis sufficient to generate a very Vivid Light._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Postscript.\r\n\r\nAnnexed some Hours after the Observations were Written.\r\n\r\n_So many particulars taken notice of in one Night, may make this Stone\r\nappear a kind of Prodigie, and the rather, because having try'd as I\r\nformerly noted, not only a fine Artificial Crystal, and some also that is\r\nNatural, but a Ruby and two Diamonds, I did not find that any of these\r\ndisclos'd the like Glimmering of Light;[43] yet after all, perceiving by\r\nthe Hardness, and the Testimony of a Skilfull Goldsmith, that this was\r\nrather a Natural than Artificial Stone; for fear lest there might be some\r\ndifference in the way of Setting, or in the shape of the Diamonds I made\r\nuse of, neither of which was like this, a flat Table-stone, I thought fit\r\nto make a farther Trial of my own Diamonds, by such a brisk and assiduous\r\nAffriction as might make amends for the Disadvantages above-mention'd, in\r\ncase they were the cause of the unsuccessfulness of the former Attempts:\r\nAnd accordingly I found, that by this way I could easily bring a Diamond I\r\nwore on my Finger to disclose a Light, that was sensible enough, and\r\ncontinued so though I cover'd it with Spittle, and us'd some other trials\r\nabout it. And this will much lessen the wonder of all the formerly\r\nmention'd Observations, by shewing that the properties that are so strange\r\nare not peculiar to one Diamond, but may be found in others also, and\r\nperhaps in divers other hard and_ Diaphanous _Stones. Yet I hope that what\r\nthis Discovery takes away from the Wonder of these Observations, it will\r\nadd to the Instructiveness of them, by affording pregnants Hints, towards\r\nthe Investigation of the Nature of Light._\r\n\r\n  [43] We afterwards, try'd precious Stones, as Diamonds, Rubies, Saphires,\r\n  and Emeralls, &c. but found not any of them to Shine except some\r\n  Diamonds, and of these we were not upon so little practice, able to\r\n  fore-tell before hand, which would be brought to Shine, and which would\r\n  not; For several very good Diamonds, either would not Shine at all, or\r\n  much less than others that were farr inferiour to them. And yet those\r\n  Ingenious Men are mistaken, that think a Diamond must be foul and cloudy,\r\n  as Mr. _Claytons_ was, to be fit for Shining; for as we could bring some\r\n  such to afford a Glimmering Light, so with some clear and excellent\r\n  Diamonds, we could do the like. But none of those many that we try'd of\r\n  all Kinds, were equal to the Diamond on which the Observations were made,\r\n  not only considering the degree of Light it afforded, but the easiness\r\n  wherewith it was excited, and the Comparatively great duration of its\r\n  Shining.\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's notes.\r\n\r\nThe Errata of the printed book have all been corrected.\r\nThey were as follows:\r\n\r\nPag. 142. l. 20.
