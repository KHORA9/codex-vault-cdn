That my effort has been successful, is\r\nproved alike by the fact that eight editions of the work have already\r\nbeen exhausted, and by the commendatory and highly gratifying terms in\r\nwhich it has been criticised by prominent statesmen and leading naval\r\nand military experts, including the Commander-in-Chief of the British\r\nArmy. Some professional critics have, it is true, questioned certain\r\nprophetic details concerning naval warfare, but I think the best\r\npossible answer to them is furnished by the results of recent battles in\r\nChinese waters, which, it is admitted, present to us very serious\r\nobject-lessons. A few passages I have revised in order to bring the\r\nevents more thoroughly up to date, and in sending my forecast forth\r\nagain it is accompanied by a devout hope that ere it be too late our\r\npresent insecurity will be remedied, that a national disaster may thus\r\nbe prevented, and that England may ever retain her supremacy upon the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM LE QUEUX.\r\n    LONDON, _March_ 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICISM BY LORD ROBERTS\r\n\r\n\r\n    UNITED SERVICE CLUB,\r\n    PALL MALL, W.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have read with considerable interest your vivid account of\r\nthe dangers to which the loss of our naval supremacy may be expected to\r\nexpose us, and the means by which you think we should be able to\r\nextricate ourselves from those dangers. I hardly like to criticise a\r\nwork which, to be effective, must to a great extent be imaginative, but\r\non one or two points I would venture to offer a few remarks:--\r\n\r\n_First_, You refer to the assistance the Home Army might receive from\r\nIndia and the Colonies. I feel confident that in such an emergency as\r\nyou portray, the Colonies and Dependencies of the Empire would be most\r\nanxious to assist the Mother Country; but unless our sea power were\r\nassured, it appears to me that they would be unable to do so. Until our\r\ncommand of the sea had been regained, we should be powerless to move a\r\nsoldier either from or to the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, You very properly lay stress on the part which might be\r\ntaken by the Volunteers in the defence of the United Kingdom. No one can\r\nappreciate more fully than I do the gallant and patriotic spirit which\r\nanimates the Volunteer Force, and I most thoroughly agree with you as to\r\nthe value it might be under such serious circumstances as you depict. In\r\nfact, the _raison d'etre_ of the Force is to be able to defend the\r\ncountry in the event of an invasion. But to enable our Volunteers to do\r\nall that is expected of them, they must be made thoroughly efficient.\r\nMuch has been done of late years to this end, but much more is required\r\nbefore our citizen soldiers can be depended upon to hold their own\r\nagainst foreign troops whose training is continually being carried on,\r\nand whose organisation is believed to be nearly perfect. It is very\r\npenny-wise and pound-foolish of us not to do all in our power to render\r\nthe Volunteers the serviceable body they might be.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, You take but little account of the Militia, which the Duke of\r\nWellington considered to be our mainstay in the event of a threatened\r\ninvasion. The Militia would seem to be rather out of fashion at present,\r\nbut still it is a very useful force, which only needs encouragement and\r\ndevelopment to convert it into a reliable fighting body, capable of\r\nreinforcing and co-operating with our small regular Army.\r\n\r\nYou will gather from what I have said that, under the conditions\r\nspecified by you, I should be inclined to regard your forecast of the\r\nresult of the supposed conflict as being unduly favourable. I can only\r\nadd that I trust such conditions may never arise, and that your estimate\r\nof the means immediately available for repelling foreign attack may be\r\nmore correct than my own.--Believe me, yours very truly,\r\n\r\n    ROBERTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL LORD ROBERTS, V.C., on reading this forecast of the Coming War,\r\nwrote as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Grove Park, Kingsbury,\r\n    Middlesex, March 26, 1894.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR,--I entirely concur with you in thinking it most\r\n    desirable to bring home to the British public in every possible\r\n    way the dangers to which the nation is exposed, unless it\r\n    maintains a Navy and Army sufficiently strong and well organised\r\n    to meet the defensive requirements of the Empire.--Believe me,\r\n    yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Signature of Roberts]\r\n\r\nField-Marshal Viscount Wolseley, K.P., in his _Life of Marlborough_,\r\nspeaks plainly when he says--\r\n\r\n    The last battle fought in England was fought to secure James his\r\n    crown. If through the folly and parsimony of our people we\r\n    should ever see another, it will be fought in defence of London.\r\n    The struggle will be, not for a dynasty, but for our own very\r\n    existence as an independent nation. Are we prepared to meet it?\r\n    The politician says Yes; the soldier and the sailor say No.\r\n\r\nSuch outspoken expressions of opinion from two of our chief military\r\nauthorities should cause the British public to pause and reflect. On all\r\nhands it is admitted by both naval and military experts, that,\r\nnotwithstanding the increase of our Navy by the Spencer programme, our\r\ncountry is inadequately defended and totally unprepared for war. The\r\nextraordinary preparations now going forward in France and Russia are\r\nbeing made in view of an attack upon England, and it is ominous that the\r\ndownfall of our Empire is a perpetual subject of discussion in the Paris\r\npress. Although a Briton, I have lived long enough in France to know\r\nthat the French, while hating the Germans, despise the English, and are\r\nlooking forward to a day not far hence when their battleships will\r\nbombard our south coast towns, and their legions advance over the Surrey\r\nHills to London. When the Great War does come, it will come swiftly, and\r\nwithout warning. We are accustomed to scoff at the idea of an invasion\r\nof Britain. We feel secure in our sea-girt island home; we have\r\nconfidence in our brave sailor defenders, in our gallant Army, and our\r\nenthusiastic Volunteers, and we entertain a supreme contempt for \"mere\r\nforeigners.\" It is this national egotism, this insular conviction that\r\nforeign engines of war are inferior to our own, that may cause our ruin.\r\nEverything we possess, everything we hold dear, our position among\r\nnations, our very life, depends for its safety, firstly, upon the\r\nundoubted predominance of our Navy over any likely or possible\r\ncombination of the Navies of Continental Powers; and, secondly, upon an\r\nArmy properly equipped and ready to take the field on receipt of the\r\nmomentous word \"Mobilise\"!\r\n\r\nIs our Navy, even strengthened by the recent programme, in a\r\nsufficiently efficient state to retain the supremacy of the seas? Let us\r\nface the situation boldly, and allow a well-known and distinguished\r\nofficer to reply to that question. Admiral of the Fleet Sir Thomas\r\nSymonds, G.C.B., writing to me, says--\r\n\r\n    Our weak Navy, with its inefficient _personnel_, has now to\r\n    perform an enormously increased duty, such as defending\r\n    increased commerce, food, and coals. Our guns are the worst in\r\n    the world in forty-seven vessels, mounting 350 muzzleloaders,\r\n    where the French and all foreign Navies use _only\r\n    breechloaders_. Dimensions, expense, and very many other reasons\r\n    are given for this ruinous custom, but all other Navies mount\r\n    breechloaders on vessels of the same dimensions as our own. As\r\n    to expenses, such economy (so-called) means the most execrable\r\n    parsimony--to ruthlessly murder men and disgrace our flag and\r\n    Navy. Our forty-seven feeble vessels, weak in armament, and all\r\n    composing them, reduce our Navy to comparative insignificance,\r\n    and are a preparation for disgrace and ruin when at war.\r\n\r\nYet we are content to sit idly by, confident in a strength which two\r\nforeign Powers are slowly but surely undermining! Russia and France,\r\nboth barely able to sustain their gigantic Armies, are to-day straining\r\nevery nerve to enlarge their naval forces, preparatory to a swift\r\ndescent upon our shores. This alarming fact we wilfully disregard,\r\naffecting to find humour in the Franco-Muscovite preparations. Thus,\r\nunless we maintain a Navy of sufficient strength to prevent invasion,\r\nWar, with its attendant horrors, is inevitable, and the scene of battle\r\nwill be England's smiling fields.\r\n\r\nTurning to our Army, what do we find? Even the civilian writer who\r\nstudies it is amazed at the muddle of insufficiency in which it is\r\nsteeped. Our Home Defence Scheme is a very elaborate paper problem, but\r\nas our forces have never been mobilised, its many glaring defects must,\r\nalas! remain unremedied until our highways echo to the tramp of an\r\nenemy. Upon this point a volume might be written, but a few plain facts\r\nmust suffice. Military experts will, I think, agree when I assert that\r\nthe 2nd Corps, as planned by this grotesque scheme, does not and cannot\r\nexist; and while the 3rd Corps may possibly stand as regards infantry,\r\nbecause its infantry are all Militia, yet it will have neither Regular\r\ncavalry nor guns. Every one of the staffs is a myth, and the equipment\r\nand commissariat arrangements are a complete guarantee of collapse at\r\nthe outset of mobilisation. What, for instance, can be said of a system\r\nin which one unit of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade \"mobilises,\" and obtains\r\nits \"personal\" and part of its \"regimental\" equipment at Plymouth; the\r\nother part of its regimental paraphernalia, including munitions, at\r\nAldershot; and its horses--at Dublin? Practically, half our cavalry at\r\nhome are to-day, however, incapable of mobilisation, for, according to\r\nthe latest return available, I find that over six thousand cavalry men\r\nhave no horses! Again, the Volunteers, upon whom we must depend for the\r\ndefence of London, have no transport, and the ammunition columns for\r\nthe 3rd Army Corps and the Regular cavalry do not exist. Such staggering\r\ndeficits as these are in themselves sufficient to show how critical\r\nwould be our position if England were invaded, and in order to give an\r\nadequate idea of what we may expect during that reign of terror, I have\r\npenned the narrative which follows. Some, no doubt, believe that our\r\nenemies will treat us with more mercy than I have shown, but I firmly\r\nanticipate that in the desperate struggle for the supremacy of the\r\nworld, towns will be bombarded and international law set at naught where\r\nour invaders see a chance of success. Consequently, the ruin must be\r\nwidespread, and the loss of life enormous.\r\n\r\nIn the various strategical and tactical problems involved, I have\r\nreceived assistance from a number of well-known naval and military\r\nofficers on the active list, whose names I am, however, not at liberty\r\nto divulge. Suffice it to say that, in addition to personally going over\r\nthe whole of the ground where battles are fought, I have also obtained\r\ninformation from certain official documents not made public, and have\r\nendeavoured to bring this forecast up to date by introducing the latest\r\ninventions in guns, and showing the relative strength of Navies as they\r\nwill appear in 1897. In this latter I have been compelled to bestow\r\nnames upon many ships now building.\r\n\r\nTo Lieut. J. G. Stevens, 17th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers, who supplied\r\nme with many details regarding the Volunteers; to Mr. Alfred C.\r\nHarmsworth, F.R.G.S., whose suggestion prompted me to write this\r\nnarrative; and to Mr. Harold Harmsworth, who on several occasions\r\nassisted me, I hereby acknowledge my thanks. While many readers will no\r\ndoubt regard this book chiefly as an exciting piece of fiction, I trust\r\nthat no small proportion will perceive the important lesson underlying\r\nit, for the French are laughing at us, the Russians presume to imitate\r\nus, and the Day of Reckoning is hourly advancing.\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM LE QUEUX.\r\n\r\n    PRINCE OF WALES'S CLUB,\r\n    COVENTRY STREET, W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n    _BOOK I_\r\n    THE INVASION\r\n\r\n    CHAP.

The crisis was swift, complete,\r\ncrushing. Actors and audience were appalled.\r\n\r\nThough it was a gay comic opera that was being performed for the first\r\ntime, entertainers and entertained lost all interest in each other. They\r\nwere amazed, dismayed, awestricken. Amusement was nauseating; War, with\r\nall its attendant horrors, was actually upon them! The popular tenor,\r\none of the idols of the hour, blundered over his lines and sang terribly\r\nout of tune, but the hypercritical first-night audience passed the\r\ndefect unnoticed. They only thought of what might happen; of the dark\r\ncavernous future that lay before.\r\n\r\nWar had been declared against Britain--Britain, the Empire that had so\r\nlong rested in placid sea-girt security, confident of immunity from\r\nattack, was to be invaded! The assertion seemed preposterous.\r\n\r\nSome, after reading eagerly the newspapers still damp from the press,\r\nsmiled incredulously, half inclined to regard the startling intelligence\r\nas a mere fabrication by alarmists, or a perfected phase of the\r\nperiodical war-scare which sensational journalists annually launch upon\r\nthe world during what is technically known as the \"gooseberry\" season.\r\n\r\nOther readers, however, recollecting the grave political crises on the\r\nContinent, set their teeth firmly, silent and dumfounded. Upon many\r\nmerchants and City men the news fell like a thunderbolt, for financial\r\nruin stared them in the face.\r\n\r\nEvidently a desperate attempt would be made by the enemy to land on\r\nEnglish soil. Already the startled playgoers could hear in their excited\r\nimagination the clash of arms mingling with the triumphant yell of the\r\nvictor, and the stifled, despairing cry of the hapless victim. But who,\r\nthey wondered, would be the victim? Would Britannia ever fall to the\r\ndust with broken trident and shattered shield? Would her neck ever lie\r\nunder the heel of the foreign invader? No, never--while Britons could\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nThe theatre, in its garish blaze of electricity, and crowded with\r\nwell-dressed men and women, presented a brilliant appearance, which had\r\nsuddenly become strangely incongruous with the feelings of the audience.\r\nIn the boxes, where youth and beauty smiled, the bouquets which had been\r\nprovided by the management gave to the theatre a bright, artistic touch\r\nof colour. Yet the pungent odour they diffused had become sickening.\r\nIntermingled with other flowers there were many tuberoses. They are\r\nfunereal blossoms, ineffably emblematic of the grave. There is death in\r\ntheir breath.\r\n\r\nWhen the astounding news fell upon the house the performance was drawing\r\nto a close. A moment before, every one had been silent and motionless,\r\nlistening with rapt attention to the tenor's plaintive love song, and\r\nadmiring the grace of the fair heroine, but as the terrible truth dawned\r\nupon them they rose, amid a scene of the wildest excitement. The few\r\npapers that had been purchased at fabulous prices at the doors were\r\neagerly scanned, many of the sheets being torn into shreds in the mad\r\nstruggle to catch a glimpse of the alarming telegrams they contained.\r\nFor a few moments the agitation nearly approached a panic, while above\r\nthe hum and din the hoarse, strident voices of running newsmen could be\r\nheard outside, yelling, \"War declared against England! Expected landing\r\nof the enemy! Extrur-speshal!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a hidden terror in the word \"War\" that at first held the\r\namazed playgoers breathless and thoughtful. Never before had its\r\nsignificance appeared so grim, so fatal, so fraught with appalling\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nWar had been actually declared! There was no averting it! It was a stern\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nNo adroit diplomatic negotiations could stem the advancing hordes of\r\nforeign invaders; Ministers and ambassadors were as useless pawns, for\r\ntwo great nations had had the audacity to combine in the projected\r\nattack upon Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIt seemed incredible, impossible. True, a Great War had long been\r\npredicted, forecasts had been given of coming conflicts, and European\r\nnations had for years been gradually strengthening their armies and\r\nperfecting their engines of war, in the expectation of being plunged\r\ninto hostilities. Modern improvements in arms and ammunition had so\r\naltered the conditions of war, that there had long been a feeling of\r\ninsecurity even among those Powers who, a few years before, had felt\r\nthemselves strong enough to resist any attack, however violent.\r\nWar-scares had been plentiful, crises in France, Germany, and Russia of\r\nfrequent occurrence; still, no one dreamed that Moloch was in their\r\nmidst--that the Great War, so long foreshadowed, had in reality\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nYet on this hot, oppressive Saturday night in August the extra-special\r\neditions of the papers contained news that startled the world. It ran as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    INVASION OF ENGLAND.\r\n    WAR DECLARED BY FRANCE AND RUSSIA.\r\n    HOSTILE FLEETS ADVANCING.\r\n    EXTRAORDINARY MANIFESTO BY THE TSAR.\r\n    [REUTER'S TELEGRAMS.]\r\n\r\n    St. Petersburg, _August 14th_, 4 P.M.\r\n\r\n    The most intense excitement has been caused here by a totally\r\n    unexpected and amazing announcement made this afternoon by the\r\n    Minister of Foreign Affairs to the French Ambassador. It appears\r\n    that the Minister has addressed to the French representative a\r\n    short note in which the following extraordinary passage\r\n    occurs:--\r\n\r\n    \"The earnest negotiations between the Imperial Government and\r\n    Great Britain for a durable pacification of Bosnia not having\r\n    led to the desired accord, His Majesty the Tsar, my august\r\n    master, sees himself compelled, to his regret, to have recourse\r\n    to force of arms. Be therefore so kind as to inform your\r\n    Government that from to-day Russia considers herself in a state\r\n    of war with Great Britain, and requests that France will\r\n    immediately comply with the obligations of the alliance signed\r\n    by President Carnot on February 23rd, 1892.\"\r\n\r\n    A circular note has also been addressed by the Russian Foreign\r\n    Office to its ambassadors at the principal Courts of Europe,\r\n    stating that, for reasons assigned, the Tsar has resolved to\r\n    commence hostilities against Great Britain, and has given his\r\n    Armies and Navy orders to commence the invasion.\r\n\r\n    This declaration has, no doubt, been contemplated by the Russian\r\n    Government for several days. During the past week the French\r\n    Ambassador has twice had private audience of the Tsar, and soon\r\n    after 11 A.M. to-day he had a long interview at the Ministry of\r\n    Foreign Affairs. It is understood that the Minister of War was\r\n    also present.\r\n\r\n    No official notification of the Declaration of War has been\r\n    given to the British Ambassador. This has created considerable\r\n    surprise.\r\n\r\n    5.30 P.M.\r\n\r\n    Large posters, headed \"A Manifesto of His Majesty the Emperor of\r\n    Russia,\" and addressed to his subjects, are being posted up in\r\n    the Nevski Prospekt. In this document the Tsar says--\r\n\r\n    \"Our faithful and beloved subjects know the strong interest\r\n    which we have constantly felt in the destinies of our Empire.\r\n    Our desire for the pacification of our western frontier has been\r\n    shared by the whole Russian nation, which now shows itself ready\r\n    to bear fresh sacrifices to alleviate the position of those\r\n    oppressed by British rule. The blood and property of our\r\n    faithful subjects have always been dear to us, and our whole\r\n    reign attests our constant solicitude to preserve to Russia the\r\n    benefits of peace. This solicitude never failed to actuate my\r\n    father during events which occurred recently in Bulgaria,\r\n    Austro-Hungary, and Bosnia. Our object, before all, was to\r\n    effect an amelioration in the position of our people on the\r\n    frontier by means of pacific negotiations, and in concert with\r\n    the great European Powers, our allies and friends. Having,\r\n    however, exhausted our pacific efforts, we are compelled by the\r\n    haughty obstinacy of Great Britain to proceed to more decisive\r\n    acts. A feeling of equity and of our own dignity enjoins it. By\r\n    her recent acts Great Britain places us under the necessity of\r\n    having recourse to arms. Profoundly convinced of the justice of\r\n    our cause, we make known to our faithful subjects that we\r\n    declare war against Great Britain. In now invoking a blessing\r\n    upon our valiant armies, we give the order for an invasion of\r\n    England.\"\r\n\r\n    This manifesto has excited the greatest enthusiasm. The news has\r\n    spread rapidly, and dense crowds have assembled in the Nevski,\r\n    the Izak Platz, and on the English Quay, where the posters are\r\n    being exhibited.\r\n\r\n    The British Ambassador has not yet received any communication\r\n    from the Imperial Government.\r\n\r\n    Fontainebleau, _Aug. 14th_, 4.30 P.M.\r\n\r\n    President Felix Faure has received a telegram from the French\r\n    representative at St. Petersburg, stating that Russia has\r\n    declared war against Great Britain. The President left\r\n    immediately for Paris by special train.\r\n\r\n    Paris, _Aug. 14th_, 4.50 P.M.\r\n\r\n    An astounding piece of intelligence has this afternoon been\r\n    received at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is no less than\r\n    a Declaration of War by Russia against Britain. The telegram\r\n    containing the announcement was received at the Ministry from\r\n    the French Ambassador at St. Petersburg soon after three\r\n    o'clock. The President was at once informed, and the Cabinet\r\n    immediately summoned. A meeting is now being held for the\r\n    purpose of deciding upon the course to be pursued with regard to\r\n    the obligations of France contracted by the Treaty of Alliance\r\n    made after the Cronstadt incident in 1891. The news of impending\r\n    hostilities has just been published in a special edition of the\r\n    _Soir_, and has created the wildest excitement on the\r\n    Boulevards. Little doubt is entertained that France will join\r\n    the invading forces, and the result of the deliberations of the\r\n    Cabinet is anxiously awaited. President Felix Faure has returned\r\n    from Fountainebleau.\r\n\r\n    [BY TELEPHONE THROUGH DALZIEL'S AGENCY.]\r\n\r\n    6 P.M.\r\n\r\n    The meeting of the Cabinet has just concluded. It has been\r\n    resolved that France shall unreservedly render assistance to\r\n    Russia. There is great activity at the War Office, and troops\r\n    are already being ordered on active service. The excitement in\r\n    the streets is increasing.\r\n\r\n    [REUTER'S TELEGRAMS.]\r\n\r\n    Berlin, _Aug. 14th_, 5.30 P.M.\r\n\r\n    Telegrams received here from St. Petersburg report that Russia\r\n    has unexpectedly declared war against Great Britain, and called\r\n    upon France to aid her in a combined attack. The report is\r\n    scarcely credited here, and further details are being eagerly\r\n    awaited. The Emperor, who was to have left for Bremen this\r\n    afternoon, has abandoned his journey, and is now in consultation\r\n    with the Chancellor.\r\n\r\n    Christiansand, _Aug. 14th_, 7.30 P.M.\r\n\r\n    The French Channel Squadron, which has been manoeuvring for the\r\n    past fortnight off the western coast of Norway, anchored outside\r\n    the fjord here last night. This morning, according to rumour,\r\n    the Russian Squadron arrived suddenly, and lay about thirty\r\n    miles off land. Secret telegraphic orders were received at 6\r\n    P.M. by the Admirals of both fleets almost simultaneously, and\r\n    the whole of the vessels left in company half an hour later.\r\n    They sailed in a southerly direction, but their destination is\r\n    unknown.\r\n\r\n    Dieppe, _Aug. 14th_, 8 P.M.\r\n\r\n    Ten transport vessels are embarking troops for England. Four\r\n    regiments of cavalry, including the 4th Chasseurs and 16th\r\n    Guards, are--[1]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] The conclusion of this message has not reached us, all the wires\r\nconnecting this country with France having been cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nA TOTTERING EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe excitement in the theatre had increased, and the curtain had been\r\nrung down. Death shadows, grimly apparent, had fallen upon the house,\r\nand the scene was an extraordinary and unprecedented one. No such wild\r\nrestlessness and impetuous agitation had ever before been witnessed\r\nwithin those walls. Some enthusiast of the pit, springing to his feet,\r\nand drawing a large red handkerchief from his pocket, waved it,\r\nshouting--\r\n\r\n\"Three cheers for good Old England!\" to which, after a moment's silence,\r\nthe audience responded lustily.\r\n\r\nThen, almost before the last sound had died away, another patriot of the\r\npeople mounted upon his seat, crying--\r\n\r\n\"No one need fear. The British Lion will quickly hold the French Eagle\r\nand the Russian Bear within his jaws. Let the enemy come; we will mow\r\nthem down like hay.\"\r\n\r\nThis raised a combined laugh and cheer, though it sounded forced and\r\nhollow. Immediately, however, some buoyant spirits in the gallery\r\ncommenced singing \"Rule, Britannia,\" the chorus of which was taken up\r\nvigorously, the orchestra assisting by playing the last verse.\r\n\r\nOutside, the scene in the streets was one of momentarily increasing\r\nexcitement. The news had spread with marvellous rapidity, and the whole\r\ncity was agog. An elbowing, waving, stormy crowd surged down the Strand\r\nto Trafalgar Square, where an impromptu demonstration was being held,\r\nthe Government being denounced by its opponents, and spoken of with\r\nconfidence by its supporters. The Radical, the Socialist, the Anarchist,\r\neach aired his views, and through the throng a hoarse threatening murmur\r\ncondensed into three words, \"Down with Russia! Down with France!\" The\r\ncry, echoed by a thousand throats, mingled weirdly with the shouts of\r\nthe newsmen and the snatches of patriotic songs.\r\n\r\nLondon was anxious, fevered, and turbulent, that hot, moonless August\r\nnight. At that hour all the shops were closed, and the streets only\r\nlighted by the lamps. From the unlighted windows the indistinct shapes\r\nof heads looking out on the scene could be distinguished.\r\n\r\nOn the pavements of Piccadilly and Knightsbridge knots of people stood\r\narguing and wrangling over the probable turn of events. From uncouth\r\nWhitechapel to artistic Kensington, from sylvan Highgate to the villadom\r\nof Dulwich, the amazing intelligence had been conveyed by the presses of\r\nFleet Street, which were still belching forth tons of damp news-sheets.\r\nAt first there was confidence among the people; nevertheless little by\r\nlittle this confidence diminished, and curiosity gave place to surprise.\r\nBut what could it be? All was shrouded in the darkest gloom. In the\r\natmosphere was a strange and terrible oppression that seemed to weigh\r\ndown men and crush them. London was, it appeared, walled in by the\r\nunknown and the unexpected.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, England was strong; it was the mighty British Empire; it\r\nwas the world. What was there to fear? Nothing. So the people continued\r\nto shout, \"Down with France! Down with the Autocrat! Down with the\r\nTsar!\"\r\n\r\nA young man, who had been sitting alone in the stalls, had risen,\r\nelectrified at the alarming news, and rushing out, hailed a passing cab,\r\nand drove rapidly away up Northumberland Avenue. This conduct was\r\nremarkable, for Geoffrey Engleheart was scarcely the man to flinch when\r\ndanger threatened. He was a tall, athletic young fellow of twenty-six,\r\nwith wavy brown hair, a dark, smartly-trimmed moustache, and handsome,\r\nwell-cut features. He was happy and easy-going, always overflowing with\r\ngenuine _bonhomie_. As the younger son of a very distinguished officer,\r\nhe contrived to employ himself for a couple of hours a day at the\r\nForeign Office, where, although a clerk, he held a very responsible\r\nposition. Belonging to a rather good set, he was a member of several\r\nfashionable clubs, and lived in cosy, well-furnished chambers in St.\r\nJames's Street.\r\n\r\nDriving first to the house of his _fiancee_, Violet Vayne, at Rutland\r\nGate, he informed her family of the startling intelligence; then,\r\nre-entering the conveyance, he subsequently alighted before the door of\r\nhis chambers. As he paid the cabman, an ill-clad man pushed a newspaper\r\ninto his face, crying, \"'Ere y'are, sir. Extrur-special edition o' the\r\n_People_. Latest details. Serious scandal at the Forrin' Office.\"\r\n\r\nGeoffrey started. He staggered, his heart gave a bound, and his face\r\nblanched. Thrusting half a crown into the man's dirty palm, he grasped\r\nthe paper, and rushing upstairs to his sitting-room, cast himself into a\r\nchair. In breathless eagerness he glanced at the front page of the\r\njournal, and read the following:--\r\n\r\n    SCANDAL AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE.\r\n    A STATE SECRET DIVULGED.\r\n\r\n    An extraordinary rumour is going the round of the Service clubs\r\n    to-night. It is alleged that the present Declaration of War\r\n    would have been impossible but for the treachery of some person\r\n    through whose hands the transcript of a secret treaty between\r\n    England and Germany passed to-day.\r\n\r\n    A prominent Cabinet Minister, on being questioned by our\r\n    reporter on the subject, admitted that he had heard the rumour,\r\n    but declined to make any definite statement whether or not it\r\n    was true.\r\n\r\n    There must be a good deal behind the rumour of treachery,\r\n    inasmuch as none of the prominent men who have already been\r\n    interviewed gave a denial to the statement.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey sat pale and motionless, with eyes fixed upon the printed\r\nwords. He read and re-read them until the lines danced before his gaze,\r\nand he crushed the paper in his hands, and cast it from him.\r\n\r\nThe little French clock on the mantelshelf chimed the hour of one upon\r\nits silvery bell; the lamp spluttered and burned dim. Still he did not\r\nmove; he was dumfounded, rooted to the spot.\r\n\r\nBlacker and blacker grew the crowd outside. The density of the cloud\r\nthat hung over all portended some direful tragedy. The impending\r\ndisaster made itself felt. An alarming sense of calmness filled the\r\nstreets. A silence had suddenly fallen, and was becoming complete and\r\nthreatening. What was it that was about to issue from these black\r\nstorm-clouds? Who could tell?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nARMING FOR THE STRUGGLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon was amazed.\r\n\r\nThe provinces were awestricken, paralysed by the startling suddenness\r\nwith which the appalling news of the invasion had been flashed to them.\r\nBewildered, the people could not believe it.\r\n\r\nOnly slowly did the vivid and terrible truth dawn individually upon the\r\nmillions north and south, and then, during the Day of Rest, they crowded\r\nto the newspaper and telegraph offices, loudly clamouring for further\r\ndetails of the overwhelming catastrophe that threatened. They sought for\r\ninformation from London; they expected London, the mighty, all-powerful\r\ncapital, to act.\r\n\r\nThrough the blazing Sunday the dust rose from the impatient, perspiring\r\ncrowds in towns and cities, and the cool night brought no rest from a\r\nturmoil now incessant. Never before were such scenes of intense\r\nenthusiasm witnessed in England, Wales, and Scotland, for this was the\r\nfirst occasion on which the public felt the presence of invaders at\r\ntheir very doors.\r\n\r\nA mighty force was on its way to ruin their homes, to sweep from them\r\ntheir hard-earned savings, to crush, to conquer--to kill them!\r\n\r\nFierce antagonism rose spontaneously in every Briton's heart, and during\r\nthat never-to-be-forgotten day, at every barracks throughout the\r\ncountry, recruiting-sergeants were besieged by all sorts and conditions\r\nof men eager to accept the Queen's shilling, and strike for their\r\ncountry's honour. Heedless of danger, of hardship, of the fickle fortune\r\nof the fight, the determination to assist in the struggle rose instantly\r\nwithin them.\r\n\r\nAt York, Chester, Edinburgh, and Portsmouth, volunteers came forward by\r\nhundreds. All were enthusiastic, undrilled, but ready to use their\r\nguns--genuinely heroic patriots of our land, such as are included in no\r\nother nation than the British. Pluck, zeal for the public safety, and an\r\nintense partisanship towards their fellows induced thousands to join the\r\ncolours--many, alas! to sink later beneath a foeman's bullet, unknown,\r\nunhonoured heroes!\r\n\r\nAlready the Cabinet had held a hurried meeting, at which it had been\r\ndecided to call out the whole of the Reserves. Of this the War Office\r\nand Admiralty had been notified, and the Queen had given her sanction to\r\nthe necessary proclamations, with the result that telegraphic orders had\r\nbeen issued to general officers commanding and to officers commanding\r\nReservists to mobilise instantly.\r\n\r\nThe posters containing the proclamation, which are always kept in\r\nreadiness in the hands of officers commanding Regimental Districts, were\r\nissued immediately, and exhibited on all public places throughout the\r\nkingdom. On the doors of town halls, churches, chapels, police stations,\r\nmilitary barracks, and in the windows of post offices, these notices\r\nwere posted within a few hours. Crowds everywhere collected to read\r\nthem, and the greatest enthusiasm was displayed. Militia, Yeomanry,\r\nVolunteers, all were called out, and men on reading the Mobilisation\r\nOrder lost no time in obtaining their accoutrements and joining their\r\ndepots. The national danger was imminent, and towards their \"places of\r\nconcentration\" all categories of Her Majesty's forces were already\r\nmoving. In every Regimental District the greatest activity was\r\ndisplayed. No country maintains in peace the full complement, or\r\nanything approaching the full complement of transport which its Armies\r\nrequire; hence vehicles and horses to complete the Army Service Corps\r\ncompanies, and for the supplemental service, were being immediately\r\nrequisitioned from far and near.\r\n\r\nOne of the many anomalies discovered during this critical period was,\r\nthat while transport could thus be rapidly requisitioned, yet the\r\nimpressment of civilians as drivers and caretakers of the animals was\r\nnot permitted by the law; therefore on all hands the organisation of\r\nthis requisitioned transport was fraught with the utmost difficulty, the\r\nmajority of owners and employees refusing to come forward voluntarily.\r\nRegistered horses were quickly collected, but they were far from\r\nsufficient for the requirements, and the want of animals caused loud\r\noutcries from every Regimental District.\r\n\r\nThe general scheme was the constitution of a Field Army of four cavalry\r\nbrigades and three army corps, with behind them a semi-mobile force made\r\nup of thirty-three Volunteer infantry brigades and eighty-four Volunteer\r\nbatteries of position. The garrisons having been provided for, the four\r\ncavalry brigades and the 1st and 2nd Army Corps were to be composed\r\nentirely of Regulars, the 3rd Army Corps being made up of Regulars,\r\nMilitia, and Volunteers. Organised in brigades, the Yeomanry were\r\nattached to the various infantry brigades or divisions of the Field\r\nArmy, and the Regular Medical Staff Corps being much too weak, was\r\nstrengthened from companies of the Volunteer Medical Staff Corps. In\r\nbrief, the scheme was the formation of a composite Field Army, backed by\r\na second line of partially trained Auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nSuch a general scheme to set in battle order our land forces for home\r\ndefence was, no doubt, well devised. Nevertheless, from the first moment\r\nthe most glaring defects in the working out of details were everywhere\r\nmanifested. Stores were badly disposed, there was a sad want of\r\nclothing, camp equipment, and arms, and the arrangements for the joining\r\nof Reservists were throughout defective. Again, the whole Reserve had\r\nbeen left totally untrained from the day the men left the colours; and\r\nhaving in view the fact that all leading authorities in Europe had,\r\ntimes without number, told us that the efficiency of an Army depended\r\non drill, discipline, and shooting, what could be expected from a system\r\nwhich relied in great part for the safety of the country on a Reserve,\r\nthe members of which were undisciplined, undrilled, and unpractised in\r\nshooting for periods ranging from nine years in the Guards to five years\r\nin the case of the Line?\r\n\r\nOn the day of mobilisation not a single regiment in the United Kingdom\r\nwas ready to move forward to the front as it stood on parade! Not an\r\nofficer, not a man, was prepared. England had calmly slept for years,\r\nwhile military reforms had been effected in every other European\r\ncountry. Now she had been suddenly and rudely awakened!\r\n\r\nEverywhere it was commented upon that no practical peace trial of the\r\nmobilisation scheme had ever been made. Little wonder was there, then,\r\nthat incomplete details hampered rapid movements, or that the carrying\r\nout of the definite and distinct programme was prevented by gaps\r\noccurring which could not be discovered until the working of the system\r\nhad been tested by actual experiment.\r\n\r\nIt was this past apathy of the authorities, amounting to little less\r\nthan criminal negligence, that formed the text of the vehement\r\noutpourings of Anarchists, Socialists, and \"No War\" partisans. A\r\npractical test of the efficiency of the scheme to concentrate our forces\r\nshould have taken place even at the risk of public expenditure, instead\r\nof making the experiment when the enemy were actually at our doors.\r\n\r\nAnother anomaly which, in the opinion of the public, ought long ago to\r\nhave been removed, was the fact that the billeting of troops on the\r\nmarch on the inhabitants of the United Kingdom, other than owners of\r\nhotels, inns, livery stables, and public-houses, is illegal, while\r\ntroops when not on the march cannot be billeted at all! At many points\r\nof concentration this absurd and antiquated regulation, laid down by the\r\nArmy Act in 1881, was severely felt. Public buildings, churches, and\r\nschools had to be hired for the accommodation of the troops, and those\r\nothers who could not find private persons hospitable enough to take them\r\nin were compelled to bivouac where they could. Of tents they had\r\nscarcely any, and many regiments were thus kept homeless and badly fed\r\nseveral days before moving forward!\r\n\r\nWas there any wonder, then, that some men should lose heart? Did not\r\nsuch defects portend--nay, invite disaster?\r\n\r\nStrange though it may seem, Geoffrey Engleheart was one of but two\r\npersons in England who had on that Saturday anticipated this sudden\r\nDeclaration of War.\r\n\r\nThrough the hot night, without heed of the wild turbulence outside,\r\nregardless of the songs of patriots, of gleeful shouts of Anarchists,\r\nthat, mingling into a dull roar, penetrated the heavy curtains before\r\nthe window of his room, he sat with brows knit and gaze transfixed.\r\n\r\nWords now and then escaped his compressed lips. They were low and\r\nominous; utterances of blank despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE SPY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCount von Beilstein was a polished cosmopolitan. He was in many ways a\r\nvery remarkable man.\r\n\r\nIn London society he was as popular as he had previously been in Paris\r\nand in Berlin. Well-preserved and military-looking, he retained the\r\nvigour, high spirits, and spruce step of youth, spent his money freely,\r\nand led the almost idyllic life of a careless bachelor in the Albany.\r\n\r\nSince his partnership with Sir Joseph Vayne, the well-known shipowner,\r\nfather of Geoffrey's _fiancee_, he had taken up a prominent position in\r\ncommercial circles, was a member of the London Chamber of Commerce, took\r\nan active part in the various deliberations of that body, and in the\r\nCity was considered a man of considerable importance.\r\n\r\nHow we of the world, however shrewd, are deceived by outward\r\nappearances!\r\n\r\nOf the millions in London there were but two men who knew the truth; who\r\nwere aware of the actual position held by this German landed proprietor.\r\nIndeed, the Count's friends little dreamed that under the outward cloak\r\nof careless ease induced by wealth there was a mind endowed with a\r\ncunning that was extraordinary, and an ingenuity that was marvellous.\r\nTruth to tell, Karl von Beilstein, who posed as the owner of the great\r\nBeilstein estates, extending along the beautiful valley of the\r\nMoselle, between Alf and Cochem, was not an aristocrat at all, and\r\npossessed no estate more tangible than the proverbial chateau in Spain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"COUNT VON BEILSTEIN WAS A SPY!\"]\r\n\r\nCount von Beilstein was a _spy_!\r\n\r\nHis life had been a strangely varied one; few men perhaps had seen more\r\nof the world. His biography was recorded in certain police registers.\r\nBorn in the Jews' quarter at Frankfort, he had, at an early age, turned\r\nadventurer, and for some years was well known at Monte Carlo as a\r\nsuccessful gamester. But the Fickle Goddess at last forsook him, and\r\nunder another name he started a bogus loan office in Brussels. This,\r\nhowever, did not last long, for the police one night made a raid on the\r\nplace, only to discover that Monsieur had flown. An extensive robbery of\r\ndiamonds in Amsterdam, a theft of bonds while in transit between Hanover\r\nand Berlin, and the forgery of a large quantity of Russian rouble notes,\r\nwere events which followed in quick succession, and in each of them the\r\npolice detected the adroit hand of the man who now called himself the\r\nCount von Beilstein. At last, by sheer ill-luck, he fell into the grip\r\nof the law.\r\n\r\nHe was in St. Petersburg, where he had opened an office in the Bolshaia,\r\nand started as a diamond dealer. After a few genuine transactions he\r\nobtained possession of gems worth nearly L20,000, and decamped.\r\n\r\nBut the Russian police were quickly at his heels, and he was arrested in\r\nRiga, being subsequently tried and condemned by the Assize Court at St.\r\nPetersburg to twelve years' exile in Siberia. In chains, with a convoy\r\nof convicts he crossed the Urals, and tramped for weeks on the\r\nsnow-covered Siberian Post Road.\r\n\r\nHis name still appears on the register at the forwarding prison of\r\nTomsk, with a note stating that he was sent on to the silver mines of\r\nNertchinsk, the most dreaded in Asiatic Russia.\r\n\r\nYet, strangely enough, within twelve months of his sentence he appeared\r\nat Royat-les-Bains, in Auvergne, posing as a Count, and living\r\nexpensively at one of the best hotels.\r\n\r\nThere was a reason for all this. The Russian Government, when he was\r\nsentenced, were well aware of his perfect training as a cosmopolitan\r\nadventurer, of his acquaintance with persons of rank, and of his cool\r\nunscrupulousness. Hence it was that one night while on the march along\r\nthe Great Post Road to that bourne whence few convicts return, it was\r\nhinted to him by the captain of Cossacks, that he might obtain his\r\nliberty, and a good income in addition, if he consented to become a\r\nsecret agent of the Tsar.\r\n\r\nThe authorities desired him to perform a special duty; would he consent?\r\nHe could exchange a life of heavy toil in the Nertchinsk mines for one\r\nof comparative idleness and ease. The offer was tempting, and he\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nThat same night it was announced to his fellow-convicts that the Tsar\r\nhad pardoned him; his leg-fetters were thereupon struck off, and he\r\nstarted upon his return to St. Petersburg to receive instructions as to\r\nthe delicate mission he was to perform.\r\n\r\nIt was then, for the first time, that he became the Count von Beilstein,\r\nand his subsequent actions all betrayed the most remarkable daring,\r\nforethought, and tact. With one object in view he exercised an amount of\r\npatience that was almost incredible. One or two minor missions were\r\nentrusted to him by his official taskmasters on the banks of the Neva,\r\nand in each he acquitted himself satisfactorily. Apparently he was a\r\nthoroughly patriotic subject of the Kaiser, with tastes strongly\r\nanti-Muscovite, and after his partnership with Sir Joseph Vayne he\r\nresided in London, and mixed a good deal with military men, because he\r\nhad, he said, held a commission in a Hussar regiment in the Fatherland,\r\nand took the liveliest interest in all military matters.\r\n\r\nLittle did those officers dream that the information he gained about\r\nimprovements in England's defences was forwarded in regular and\r\ncarefully-written reports to the Russian War Office, or that the Tsar's\r\nmessenger who carried weekly despatches between the Russian Ambassador\r\nin London and his Government frequently took with him a packet\r\ncontaining plans and tracings which bore marginal notes in the angular\r\nhandwriting of the popular Count von Beilstein!\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of this memorable day when the startling news of\r\nthe Declaration of War had reached England, a telegram had been handed\r\nto the Tsar's secret agent while he was still in bed.\r\n\r\nHe read it through; then stared thoughtfully up at the ceiling.\r\n\r\nThe message, in code, from Berlin, stated that a draft of a most\r\nimportant treaty between Germany and England had been despatched from\r\nthe German Foreign Office, and would arrive in London that day. The\r\nmessage concluded with the words, \"It is imperative that we should have\r\na copy of this document, or at least a summary of its contents,\r\nimmediately.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough sent from Berlin, the Count was well aware that it was an order\r\nfrom the Foreign Minister in St. Petersburg, the message being\r\ntransmitted to Berlin first, and then retransmitted to London, in order\r\nto avoid any suspicion that might arise in the case of messages\r\nexchanged direct with the Russian capital. Having read the telegram\r\nthrough several times, he whistled to himself, rose quickly, dressed,\r\nand breakfasted. While having his meal, he gave some instructions to\r\nGrevel, his valet, and sent him out upon an errand, at the same time\r\nexpressing his intention of waiting in until his return.\r\n\r\n\"Remember,\" the Count said, as his man was going out, \"be careful to\r\narouse no suspicion. Simply make your inquiries in the proper quarter,\r\nand come back immediately.\"\r\n\r\nAt half-past twelve o'clock, as Geoffrey Engleheart was busy writing\r\nalone in his room at the Foreign Office, he was interrupted by the\r\nopening of the door.\r\n\r\n\"Hulloa, dear boy! I've found my way up here by myself. Busy, as usual,\r\nI see!\" cried a cheery voice as the door slowly opened, and Geoffrey\r\nlooking up saw it was his friend the Count, well groomed and fashionably\r\nattired in glossy silk hat, perfect-fitting frock coat, and varnished\r\nboots. He called very frequently upon Engleheart, and had long ago\r\nplaced himself on excellent terms with the messengers and doorkeepers,\r\nwho looked upon him as a most generous visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how are you?\" Engleheart exclaimed, rising and shaking his hand.\r\n\"You must really forgive me, Count, but I quite forgot my appointment\r\nwith you to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't let me disturb you, pray. I'll have a glance at the paper\r\ntill you've finished,\" and casting himself into a chair near the window\r\nhe took up the _Times_ and was soon absorbed in it.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour went by in silence, while Engleheart wrote on,\r\ncalmly unconscious that there was a small rent in the newspaper the\r\nCount was reading, and that through it he could plainly see each word of\r\nthe treaty as it was transcribed from the secret code and written down\r\nin plain English.\r\n\r\n\"Will you excuse me for ten minutes?\" Geoffrey exclaimed presently. \"The\r\nCabinet Council is sitting, and I have to run over to see Lord Stanbury\r\nfor a moment. After I return I must make another copy of this paper, and\r\nthen I shall be free.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count, casting the newspaper wearily aside, glanced at his watch.\r\n\r\n\"It's half-past one,\" he said. \"You'll be another half-hour, if not\r\nmore. After all, I really think, old fellow, I'll go on down to\r\nHurlingham. I arranged to meet the Vaynes at two o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. I'll run down in a cab as soon as I can get away,\" answered\r\nEngleheart.\r\n\r\n\"Good. Come on as soon as you can. Violet will be expecting you, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I shall,\" replied his unsuspicious friend, and they shook\r\nhands, after which the Count put on his hat and sauntered jauntily out.\r\n\r\nIn Parliament Street he jumped into his phaeton, but instead of driving\r\nto Hurlingham gave his man orders to proceed with all speed to the\r\nGeneral Post Office, St. Martin's-le-Grand. Within half an hour from the\r\ntime he had shaken the hand of his unsuspecting friend, a message in\r\ncode--to all intents and purposes a commercial despatch--was on its way\r\nto \"Herr Brandt, 116 Friedrich Strasse, Berlin.\"\r\n\r\nThat message contained an exact transcript of the secret treaty!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RUSSIAN SPY'S TELEGRAM.]\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the Count had left, Geoffrey made a discovery.\r\nFrom the floor he picked up a small gold pencil-case which he knew\r\nbelonged to von Beilstein.\r\n\r\nEngleheart was sorely puzzled to know why the Count should require a\r\npencil if not to write, and it momentarily flashed across his mind that\r\nhe might have copied portions of the treaty. But the next minute he\r\ndismissed the suspicion as ungrounded and preposterous, and placing the\r\npencil in his pocket went in search of Lord Stanbury.\r\n\r\nIt was only the statement he read in the _People_ later, alleging\r\ntreachery at the Foreign Office, that recalled the incident to his mind.\r\nThen the horrible truth dawned upon him. He saw how probable it was that\r\nhe had been tricked.\r\n\r\nHe knew that the mine was already laid; that the only thing that had\r\nprevented an explosion that would shake the whole world had been the\r\nabsence of definite knowledge as to the exact terms of the alliance\r\nbetween England, Germany, Italy, and Austria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nBOMBARDMENT OF NEWHAVEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt sea the night was dark and moonless. A thick mist hung near the land.\r\nThe Coastguard and Artillery on our southern and eastern shores spent a\r\nterribly anxious time, peering from their points of vantage out into the\r\ncavernous darkness where no light glimmered. The Harbour Defence\r\nFlotilla was in readiness, and under the black cliffs sentinels kept\r\nwatch with every nerve strained to its highest tension, for the safety\r\nof England now depended upon their alertness. The great waves crashed\r\nand roared, and the mist, obscuring the light of vessels passing up and\r\ndown the Channel, seemed to grow more dense as the hours wore on.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the feverish excitement that had spread everywhere\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the land, the troops were, a couple\r\nof hours after the receipt of the alarming news in London, already being\r\nmobilised and on their way south and east by special trains. Men, arms,\r\nammunition, and stores were hurried forward to repel attack, and in the\r\nWar Office and Admiralty, where the staffs had been suddenly called\r\ntogether, the greatest activity prevailed. Messages had been flashed\r\nalong the wires in every direction giving orders to mobilise and\r\nconcentrate at certain points, and these instructions were being obeyed\r\nwith that promptness for which British soldiers and sailors are\r\nproverbial.\r\n\r\nYet the high officials at the War Office looked grave, and although\r\naffecting unconcern, now and then whispered ominously together. They\r\nknew that the situation was critical. An immediate and adequate naval\r\ndefence was just possible, but the Channel Squadron was manoeuvring off\r\nthe Irish coast, and both the Coastguard Squadron and the Steam Reserve\r\nat the home ports were very weak. It was to our land army that we had to\r\ntrust, and they were divided in opinion as to the possibility to\r\nmobilise a sufficient force in time to bar the advance.\r\n\r\nMilitary experts did not overlook the fact that to Dunkirk, Calais,\r\nBoulogne, Dieppe, Fecamp, Havre, Honfleur, and Cherbourg ran excellent\r\nlines of railway, with ample rolling-stock, all Government property, and\r\nat the beck and call of the French War Minister. In the various ports\r\nthere was adequate wharf accommodation and plenty of steam tonnage. From\r\nthe brief official despatches received from Paris before the cutting of\r\nthe wires, it was apparent that the French War Office had laid its plans\r\nwith much forethought and cunning, and had provided against any\r\n_contretemps_. An army of carpenters and engineers had been put to work\r\nin the ports to alter the fittings of such of the merchant steamers as\r\nwere destined to convey horses, and these fittings, prepared beforehand,\r\nwere already in position. Four army corps had for several weeks been\r\nmanoeuvring in Normandy, so that the Reservists had become accustomed to\r\ntheir work, and in excellent condition for war; therefore these facts,\r\ncoupled with the strong support certain to be rendered by the warships\r\nof the Tsar, led experts to regard the outlook as exceedingly gloomy.\r\n\r\nFor years military and naval men had discussed the possibilities of\r\ninvasion, haggled over controversial points, but had never arrived at\r\nany definite opinion as to the possibility of an enemy's success. Now,\r\nhowever, the defences of the country were to be tested.\r\n\r\nOur great Empire was at stake.\r\n\r\nThe power of steam to cause rapid transit by land and sea, the\r\nuncertainty of the place of disembarkment, and the great weight of\r\nmodern naval artillery, combined to render the defences of England on\r\nthe coast itself most uncertain and hazardous, and to cause grave doubts\r\nto arise in the minds of those who at that critical moment were\r\ndirecting the forward movement of the forces.\r\n\r\nThe British public, whose national patriotism found vent in expressions\r\nof confidence in the Regular Army and Volunteers, were ignorant of the\r\nfacts. They knew that two great Powers had combined to crush our island\r\nstronghold, and were eager that hostilities should commence in order\r\nthat the enemy should be taught a severe lesson for their presumption.\r\n\r\nThey, however, knew nothing of the plain truth, that although the 1st\r\nArmy Corps at Aldershot would be ready to move at a few hours' notice,\r\nyet it was hopeless to try and prevent the disembarkation of the French\r\narmy corps along a long line of unprotected coast by the action of a\r\nland force only one-third of their strength.\r\n\r\nSo, by the water's edge, the lonely posts were kept through the night by\r\npatient, keen-sighted sentinels, ready at any moment to raise the alarm.\r\nBut the dense mist that overhung everything was tantalising, hiding\r\nfriend and foe alike, and no sound could be heard above the heavy roar\r\nof the waters as they rolled in over the rocks.\r\n\r\nLondon, infuriated, enthusiastic, turbulent, knew no sleep that night.\r\nThe excitement was at fever-heat. At last, soon after daybreak, there\r\ncame the first news of the enemy. A number of warships had suddenly\r\nappeared through the fog off the Sussex coast, and had lost no time in\r\nasserting their presence and demanding a large sum from the Mayor of\r\nNewhaven.\r\n\r\nThe French first-class battery cruiser _Tage_, the _Devastation_, the\r\n_Pothuau_, the _Arethuse_ and others, finding that their demand was\r\nunheeded, at once commenced shelling the town. Although our Coastguard\r\nSquadron and first-class Steam Reserve had mobilised, yet they had\r\nreceived orders and sailed away no one knew whither. The forts replied\r\nvigorously, but the fire of the enemy in half an hour had wrought\r\nterrible havoc both in the town and in the forts, where several of the\r\nguns had been rendered useless and a number of men had been killed.\r\nHostilities had commenced.\r\n\r\nNever during the century had such scenes been witnessed in the streets\r\nof London as on that memorable Sunday morning. The metropolis was\r\nthrilled.\r\n\r\nDawn was spreading, saffron tints were in the sky heralding the sun's\r\ncoming. Yet Regent Street, Piccadilly, and the Strand, usually entirely\r\ndeserted at that hour on a Sabbath morning, were crowded as if it were\r\nmidday.\r\n\r\nEverywhere there was excitement. Crowds waited in front of the newspaper\r\noffices in Fleet Street, boys with strident voices sold the latest\r\neditions of the papers, men continued their snatches of patriotic\r\nballads, while women were blanched and scared, and children clung to\r\ntheir mothers' skirts timidly, vaguely fearing an unknown terror.\r\n\r\nThe shadow of coming events was black and dim, like a funeral pall. The\r\nfate of our Empire hung upon a thread.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours ago England was smiling, content in the confidence of\r\nits perfect safety and immunity from invasion; yet all the horrors of\r\nwar had, with a startling, appalling suddenness, fallen and bewildered\r\nit. The booming of French cannon at Newhaven formed the last salute of\r\nmany a brave Briton who fell shattered and lifeless.\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose crimson from the grey misty sea, the work of destruction\r\nincreased in vigour. From the turrets of the floating monsters smoke and\r\nflame poured forth in continuous volume, while shot and shell were\r\nhurled into the town of Newhaven, which, it was apparent, was the centre\r\nof the enemy's attack, and where, owing to the deepening of the harbour,\r\ntroops could effect a landing under cover of the fire from the\r\nironclads.\r\n\r\nFrightful havoc was wrought by the shells among the houses of the little\r\ntown, and one falling on board the Brighton Railway Company's mail\r\nsteamer _Paris_, lying alongside the station quay, set her on fire. In\r\nhalf an hour railway station and quays were blazing furiously, while the\r\nflames leaped up about the ship, wrapping themselves about the two\r\nwhite funnels and darting from every porthole.\r\n\r\nThe Custom House opposite quickly ignited, and the inflammable nature of\r\nits contents caused the fire to assume enormous proportions. Meanwhile\r\nthe bombardment was kept up, the forts on shore still replying with\r\nregularity, steadiness, and precision, and the armoured coast train of\r\nthe 1st Sussex Artillery Volunteers, under Captain Brigden, rendering\r\nexcellent service. In one of the forts a man was standing in front of a\r\nsmall camera-obscura, on the glass of which were a number of mysterious\r\nmarks. This glass reflected the water and the ships; and as he stood by\r\ncalmly with his hand upon a keyboard, he watched the reflections of the\r\nhostile vessels moving backwards and forwards over the glass. Suddenly\r\nhe saw a French gunboat, after a series of smartly-executed manoeuvres,\r\nsteaming straight over one of the marks, and, quick as lightning, his\r\nfinger pressed one of the electric keys. A terrific explosion followed,\r\nand a column of green water shot up at the same instant. The gunboat\r\n_Lavel_ had been suddenly blown almost out of the water by a submarine\r\nmine! Broken portions of her black hull turned over and sank, and\r\nmangled remains of what a second before had been a crew of enthusiastic\r\nFrenchmen floated for a few moments on the surface, then disappeared.\r\nNot a soul on board escaped.\r\n\r\nAlong the telegraph line from the signal-station on Beachy Head news of\r\nthe blowing up of the enemy's gunboat was flashed to London, and when,\r\nan hour later, it appeared in the newspapers, the people went half mad\r\nwith excitement. Alas, how they miscalculated the relative strength of\r\nthe opposing forces!\r\n\r\nThey were unaware that our Channel Fleet, our Coastguard Squadron, and\r\nour Reserve were steaming away, leaving our southern shores _practically\r\nunprotected_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nLANDING OF THE FRENCH IN SUSSEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Briton is, alas! too prone to underrate his adversary. It is this\r\nnational egotism, this fatal over-confidence, that has led to most of\r\nthe reverses we have sustained in recent wars.\r\n\r\nThe popular belief that one Briton is as good as half a dozen\r\nforeigners, is a fallacy which ought to be at once expunged from the\r\nminds of every one. The improved and altered conditions under which\r\ninternational hostilities are carried on nowadays scarcely even admit of\r\na hand-to-hand encounter, and the engines of destruction designed by\r\nother European Powers being quite as perfect as our own, tact and\r\ncunning have now taken the place of pluck and perseverance. The strong\r\narm avails but little in modern warfare; strategy is everything.\r\n\r\nInto Brighton, an hour after dawn, the enemy's vessels were pouring\r\nvolley after volley of deadly missiles. A party had landed from the\r\nFrench flagship, and, summoning the Mayor, had demanded a million\r\npounds. This not being forthcoming, they had commenced shelling the\r\ntown. The fire was, for the most part, directed against the long line of\r\nshops and private residences in King's Road and at Hove, and in half an\r\nhour over a hundred houses had been demolished. The palatial Hotel\r\nMetropole stood a great gaunt ruin. Shells had carried large portions of\r\nthe noble building away, and a part of the ruin had caught fire and was\r\nburning unchecked, threatening to consume the whole. Church steeples\r\nhad been knocked over like ninepins, and explosive missiles dropped in\r\nthe centre of the town every moment, sweeping the streets with deadly\r\neffect. The enemy met with little or no opposition. Our first line of\r\ndefence, our Navy, was missing! The Admiralty were unaware of the\r\nwhereabouts of three whole Fleets that had mobilised, and the ships\r\nremaining in the Channel, exclusive of the Harbour Defence Flotilla,\r\nwere practically useless.\r\n\r\nAt Eastbourne, likewise, where a similar demand had been made, shot fell\r\nthick as hail, and shells played fearful havoc with the handsome\r\nboarding-houses and hotels that line the sea front. From the redoubt,\r\nthe Wish Tower, and a battery on the higher ground towards Beachy Head,\r\nas well as a number of other hastily constructed earthworks, a reply was\r\nmade to the enemy's fire, and the guns in the antiquated martello\r\ntowers, placed at intervals along the beach, now and then sent a shot\r\ntowards the vessels. But such an attempt to keep the great ironclads at\r\nbay was absurdly futile. One after another shells from the monster guns\r\nof the Russian ship _Pjotr Velikij_, and the armoured cruisers _Gerzog\r\nEdinburskij_, _Krejser_, and _Najezdnik_, crashed into these out-of-date\r\ncoast defences, and effectually silenced them. In Eastbourne itself the\r\ndamage wrought was enormous. Every moment shells fell and exploded in\r\nTerminus and Seaside Roads, while the aristocratic suburb of Upperton,\r\nbuilt on the hill behind the town, was exposed to and bore the full\r\nbrunt of the fray. The fine modern Queen Anne and Elizabethan residences\r\nwere soon mere heaps of burning debris. Every moment houses fell,\r\nburying their occupants, and those people who rushed out into the roads\r\nfor safety were, for the most part, either overwhelmed by debris, or had\r\ntheir limbs shattered by flying pieces of shell.\r\n\r\nThe situation was awful. The incessant thunder of cannon, the screaming\r\nof shells whizzing through the air, to burst a moment later and send a\r\ndozen or more persons to an untimely grave, the crash of falling walls,\r\nthe clouds of smoke and dust, and the blazing of ignited wreckage,\r\ncombined to produce a scene more terrible than any witnessed in England\r\nduring the present century.\r\n\r\nAnd all this was the outcome of one man's indiscretion and the cunning\r\nduplicity of two others!\r\n\r\nAt high noon Newhaven fell into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe attack had been so entirely unexpected that the troops mobilised and\r\nsent there had arrived too late. The town was being sacked, and the\r\nharbour was in the possession of the French, who were landing their\r\nforces in great numbers. From Dieppe and Havre transports were arriving,\r\nand discharging their freights of fighting men and guns under cover of\r\nthe fire from the French warships lying close in land.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the steps taken during the last twenty years to\r\nimprove the condition of our forces on land and sea, this outbreak of\r\nhostilities found us far from being in a state of preparedness for war.\r\nEngland, strangely enough, has never yet fully realised that the\r\nconditions of war have entirely changed. In days gone by, when troops\r\nand convoys could move but slowly, the difficulty of providing for\r\narmies engaged in operations necessarily limited their strength. It is\r\nnow quite different. Improved communications have given to military\r\noperations astonishing rapidity, and the facilities with which large\r\nmasses of troops, guns, and stores can now be transported to great\r\ndistances has had the effect of proportionately increasing numbers. As a\r\nresult of this, with the exception of our own island, Europe was armed\r\nto the teeth. Yet a mobilisation arrangement that was faulty and not\r\nclearly understood by officers or men, was the cause of the enemy being\r\nallowed to land. It is remarkable that the military authorities had not\r\nacted upon the one principle admitted on every side, namely, that the\r\nonly effective defence consists of attack. The attack, to succeed,\r\nshould have been sudden and opportune, and the Army should have been so\r\norganised that on the occurrence of war a force of adequate strength\r\nwould have been at once available.\r\n\r\nIn a word, we missed our chance to secure this inestimable advantage\r\nafforded by the power of striking the first blow.\r\n\r\nThere was an old and true saying, that \"England's best bulwarks were her\r\nwooden walls.\" They are no longer wooden, but it still remains an\r\nadmitted fact that England's strongest bulwarks should be her Navy, and\r\nthat any other nation may be possessed of an equally good one; also that\r\nour best bulwark should be equal to, or approach, the fighting power of\r\nthe bulwarks owned by any two possible hostile nations.\r\n\r\nTo be strong is to stave off war; to be weak is to invite attack. It was\r\nour policy of _laissez faire_, a weak Navy and an Army bound up with red\r\ntape, that caused this disastrous invasion of England. Had our Fleet\r\nbeen sufficient for its work, invasion would have remained a threat, and\r\nnothing more. Our Navy was not only our first, but our last line of\r\ndefence from an Imperial point of view; for, as a writer in the _Army\r\nand Navy Gazette_ pointed out in 1893, it was equally manifest and\r\nunquestionable that without land forces to act as the spearhead to the\r\nNavy's over-sea shaft, the offensive tactics so essential to a thorough\r\nstatesmanlike defensive policy could not be carried out. Again, the\r\nmobility and efficiency of our Regular Army should have been such that\r\nthe victory of our Fleet could be speedily and vigorously followed by\r\ndecisive blows on the enemy's territory.\r\n\r\nAlready the news of the landing of the enemy had--besides causing a\r\nthrill such as had never before been known in our \"tight little\r\nisland\"--produced its effect upon the price of food in London as\r\nelsewhere. In England we had only five days' bread-stuffs, and as the\r\nmajority of our supplies came from Russia the price of bread trebled\r\nwithin twelve hours, and the ordinary necessaries of life were\r\nproportionately dearer.\r\n\r\nBut the dice had been thrown, and the sixes lay with Moloch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nBOMB OUTRAGES IN LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that never-to-be-forgotten Sunday, scenes were witnessed in the\r\nmetropolis which were of the most disgraceful character. The teeming\r\ncity, from dawn till midnight, was in a feverish turmoil, the throngs in\r\nits streets discussing the probable turn of affairs, singing patriotic\r\nsongs, and giving vent to utterances of heroic intentions interspersed\r\nwith much horse play.\r\n\r\nIn Trafalgar Square, the hub of London, a mass meeting of Anarchists and\r\nSocialists was held, at which the Government and military authorities\r\nwere loudly denounced for what was termed their criminal apathy to the\r\ninterests and welfare of the nation. The Government, it was contended,\r\nhad betrayed the country by allowing the secret of the German alliance\r\nto fall into the hands of its enemies, and the Ministers, adjudged\r\nunworthy the confidence of the nation, were by the resolutions adopted\r\ncalled upon to resign immediately. The crisis was an excuse for\r\nAnarchism to vent its grievances against law and order, and, unshackled,\r\nit had spread with rapidity through the length and breadth of the land.\r\nIn \"The Square\" the scarlet flag and the Cap of Liberty were everywhere\r\nin evidence, and, notwithstanding the presence of the police, the\r\nleaders of Anarchy openly advocated outrage, incendiarism, and murder.\r\nAt length the police resolved to interfere, and this was the signal for\r\na terrible uprising. The huge mob, which in the mellow sunset filled\r\nthe great Square and blocked all its approaches, became a seething,\r\nsurging mass of struggling humanity. The attack by the police, who were\r\nordered to disperse them, only incensed them further against the\r\nauthorities, whom they blamed for the catastrophe that had befallen our\r\ncountry. Angry and desperate they fought with the police, using both\r\nrevolvers and knives.\r\n\r\nThe scene was terrible. The scum of the metropolis had congregated to\r\nwage war against their own compatriots whom they classed among enemies,\r\nand for an hour in the precincts of the Square the struggle was for\r\nlife. Dozens of constables were shot dead, hundreds of Anarchists and\r\nSocialists received wounds from batons, many succumbing to their\r\ninjuries, or being trampled to death by the dense mob. It was a\r\nrepetition of that historic day known as \"Bloody Sunday,\" only the fight\r\nwas more desperate and the consequences far worse, and such as would\r\ndisgrace any civilised city.\r\n\r\nBefore sundown the police had been vanquished; and as no soldiers could\r\nbe spared, Anarchism ran riot in the Strand, Pall Mall, St. Martin's\r\nLane, Northumberland Avenue, and Parliament Street. Pale, determined\r\nmen, with faces covered with blood, and others with their clothes in\r\nshreds, shouted hoarse cries of victory, as, headed by a torn red flag,\r\nthey rushed into Pall Mall and commenced breaking down the shutters of\r\nshops and looting them. Men were knocked down and murdered, and the\r\nrioters, freed from all restraint, commenced sacking all establishments\r\nwhere it was expected spoil could be obtained. At one bank in Pall Mall\r\nthey succeeded, after some difficulty, in breaking open the strong room\r\nwith explosives, and some forty or fifty of the rebels with eager\r\ngreediness shared the gold and notes they stole.\r\n\r\nAt the Strand corner of the Square a squad of police was being formed,\r\nin order to co-operate with some reinforcements which were arriving,\r\nwhen suddenly there was a terrific explosion.\r\n\r\nA bomb filled with picric acid had been thrown by an Anarchist, and when\r\nthe smoke cleared, the shattered remains of thirty-four constables lay\r\nstrewn upon the roadway!\r\n\r\nThis was but the first of a series of dastardly outrages. The advice of\r\nthe Anarchist leaders in their inflammatory speeches had been acted\r\nupon, and in half an hour a number of bomb explosions had occurred in\r\nthe vicinity, each doing enormous damage, and killing numbers of\r\ninnocent persons. After the petard had been thrown in Trafalgar Square a\r\nloud explosion was almost immediately afterwards heard in Parliament\r\nStreet, and it was soon known that a too successful attempt had been\r\nmade to blow up the Premier's official residence in Downing Street. The\r\nprogramme of the outrages had apparently been organised, for almost\r\nbefore the truth was known another even more disastrous explosion\r\noccurred in the vestibule of the War Office in Pall Mall, which wrecked\r\nthe lower part of the building, and blew to atoms the sentry on duty,\r\nand killed a number of clerks who were busy at their important duties in\r\nthe apartments on the ground floor.\r\n\r\nThrough Pall Mall and along Whitehall the mob ran, crying \"Down with the\r\nGovernment! Kill the traitors! Kill them!\" About three thousand of the\r\nmore lawless, having looted a number of shops, rushed to the Houses of\r\nParliament, arriving there just in time to witness the frightful havoc\r\ncaused by the explosion of two terribly powerful bombs that had been\r\nplaced in St. Stephen's Hall and in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nA section of the exultant rioters had gained access to the National\r\nGallery, where they carried on ruthless destruction among the priceless\r\npaintings there. Dozens of beautiful works were slashed with knives,\r\nothers were torn down, and many, cut from their frames, were flung to\r\nthe howling crowd outside. Suddenly some one screamed, \"What do we want\r\nwith Art? Burn down the useless palace! Burn it! Burn it!\"\r\n\r\nThis cry was taken up by thousands of throats, and on every hand the\r\nrebels inside the building were urged to set fire to it. Intoxicated\r\nwith success, maddened by anger at the action of the police, and\r\nconfident that they had gained a signal victory over the law, they piled\r\ntogether a number of historic paintings in one of the rooms, and then\r\nignited them. The flames leaped to the ceiling, spread to the woodwork,\r\nand thence, with appalling rapidity, to the other apartments. The\r\nwindows cracked, and clouds of smoke and tongues of fire belched forth\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nIt had now grown dusk. The furious, demoniacal rabble surging in the\r\nSquare set up loud, prolonged cheering when they saw the long dark\r\nbuilding burning. In delight they paused in their work of destruction,\r\nwatching the flames growing brighter as they burst through the roof,\r\nlicking the central dome; and while the timber crackled and the fire\r\nroared, casting a lurid glare upon the tall buildings round and lighting\r\nup the imposing facade of the Grand Hotel, they cheered vociferously and\r\nsang the \"Marseillaise\" until the smoke half choked them and their\r\nthroats grew hoarse.\r\n\r\nThese denizens of the slums, these criminal crusaders against the law,\r\nwere not yet satiated by their wild reckless orgies. Unchecked, they had\r\nrun riot up and down the Strand, and there was scarcely a man among them\r\nwho had not in his pocket some of the spoils from jewellers' or from\r\nbanks. In the glare of the flames the white bloodstained faces wore a\r\ndetermined expression as they stood collecting their energies for some\r\nother atrocious outrage against their so-called enemies, the rich.\r\n\r\nAt the first menace of excesses, dwellers in the locality had left their\r\nhouses and fled headlong for safety to other parts of the city. The\r\nmajority escaped, but many fell into the hands of the rioters, and were\r\ntreated with scant humanity. Men and women were struck down and robbed,\r\neven strangled or shot if they resisted. The scene was frightful--a\r\nterrible realisation of Anarchist prophecies that had rendered the\r\nauthorities absolutely helpless. On the one hand, an enemy had landed on\r\nour shores with every chance of a successful march to London, while on\r\nthe other the revolutionary spirit had broken out unmistakably among the\r\ncriminal class, and lawlessness and murder were everywhere rife.\r\n\r\nThe homes of the people were threatened by double disaster--by the\r\nattack of both enemy and \"friend.\" The terrible bomb outrages and their\r\nappalling results had completely disorganised the police, and although\r\nreinforcements had been telegraphed for from every division in London,\r\nthe number of men mustered at Scotland Yard was not yet sufficient to\r\ndeal effectually with the irate and rapidly increasing mob.\r\n\r\nAs evening wore on the scenes in the streets around the Square were\r\nterrible. Pall Mall was congested by the angry mob who were wrecking the\r\nclubs, when suddenly the exultant cries were succeeded by terrified\r\nshrieks mingled with fierce oaths. Each man fought with his neighbour,\r\nand many men and women, crushed against iron railings, stood half\r\nsuffocated and helpless. The National Gallery was burning fiercely,\r\nflames from the great burning pile shot high in the air, illuminating\r\neverything with their flood of crimson light, and the wind, blowing down\r\nthe crowded thoroughfare, carried smoke, sparks, and heat with it.\r\n\r\nDistant shrieks were heard in the direction of the Square, and suddenly\r\nthe crowd surged wildly forward. Gaol-birds from the purlieus of Drury\r\nLane robbed those who had valuables or money upon them, and committed\r\nbrutal assaults upon the unprotected. A moment later, however, there was\r\na flash, and the deafening sound of firearms at close quarters was\r\nfollowed by the horrified shrieks of the yelling mob. Again and again\r\nthe sound was repeated. Around them bullets whistled, and men and women\r\nfell forward dead and wounded with terrible curses upon their lips.\r\n\r\nThe 10th Hussars had just arrived from Hounslow, and having received\r\nhurried orders to clear away the rioters, were shooting them down like\r\ndogs, without mercy. On every hand cries of agony and despair rose above\r\nthe tumult. Then a silence followed, for the street was thickly strewn\r\nwith corpses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFATEFUL DAYS FOR THE OLD FLAG.\r\n\r\n\r\nA cloudy moonless night, with a gusty wind which now and then swept the\r\ntops of the forest trees, causing the leaves to surge like a summer sea.\r\n\r\nWithered branches creaked and groaned, and a dog howled dismally down in\r\nFlimwell village, half a mile away. Leaning with his back against the\r\ngnarled trunk of a giant oak on the edge of the forest, his ears alert\r\nfor the slightest sound, his hand upon his loaded magazine rifle,\r\nGeoffrey Engleheart stood on outpost duty. Dressed in a rough shooting\r\nsuit, with a deerstalker hat and an improvised kit strapped upon his\r\nback, he was half hidden by the tall bracken. Standing motionless in the\r\ndeep shadow, with his eyes fixed upon the wide stretch of sloping\r\nmeadows, he waited, ready, at the slightest appearance of the enemy's\r\nscouts, to raise the alarm and call to arms those who were sleeping in\r\nthe forest after their day's march.\r\n\r\nThe City Civilian Volunteer Battalion which he had joined was on its way\r\nto take part in the conflict, which every one knew would be desperate.\r\nUnder the command of Major Mansford, an experienced elderly officer who\r\nhad long since retired from the Lancashire Regiment, but who had at once\r\nvolunteered to lead the battalion of young patriots, they had left\r\nLondon by train for Maidstone, whence they marched by way of Linton,\r\nMarden, and Goudhurst to Frith Wood, where they had bivouacked for the\r\nnight on the Sussex border.\r\n\r\nIt was known that Russian scouts had succeeded in getting as far as\r\nWadhurst, and it was expected that one of the French reconnoitring\r\nparties must, in their circuitous survey, pass the border of the wood on\r\ntheir way back to their own lines. Up to the present they had been\r\npractically unmolested. The British army was now mobilised, and Kent,\r\nSussex, and Hampshire were overrun with soldiers. Every household gave\r\nmen accommodation voluntarily, every hostelry, from the aristocratic\r\nhotels of the watering-places to the unassuming Red Lions of the\r\nvillages, was full of Britain's brave defenders. The echoes of old-world\r\nvillage streets of thatched houses with quaint gables were awakened\r\nnight and day by the rumbling of heavy artillery, the shouts of the\r\ndrivers as they urged along their teams, and the rattle of ammunition\r\ncarts and of ambulance waggons, while on every high road leading south\r\nbattalions were on the march, and eager to come within fighting range of\r\nthe audacious foreigners.\r\n\r\nAt first the peaceful people of the villages gazed, wondered, and\r\nadmired, thinking some manoeuvres were about to take place--for military\r\nmanoeuvres always improve village trade. But they were very quickly\r\ndisillusioned. When they knew the truth--that the enemy was actually at\r\ntheir doors, that the grey-coated masses of the Russian legions were\r\nlying like packs of wolves in the undulating country between Heathfield,\r\nEtchingham, and the sea--they were panic-stricken and appalled. They\r\nwatched the stream of redcoats passing their doors, cheering them, while\r\nthose who were their guests were treated to the best fare their hosts\r\ncould provide.\r\n\r\nTommy Atkins was now the idol of the hour.\r\n\r\nApparently the enemy, having established themselves, were by no means\r\nanxious to advance with undue haste. Having landed, they were, it was\r\nascertained, awaiting the arrival of further reinforcements and\r\narmaments from both Powers; but nothing definite was known of this,\r\nexcept some meagre details that had filtered through the American\r\ncables, all direct telegraphic communication with the Continent having\r\nnow been cut off.\r\n\r\nAlas! Moloch had grinned. He had sharpened his sickle for the terrible\r\ncarnage that was to spread through Albion's peaceful land.\r\n\r\nTerrible was the panic that the invasion had produced in the North.\r\n\r\nFood had risen to exorbitant prices. In the great manufacturing centres\r\nthe toiling millions were already feeling the pinch of starvation, for\r\nwith bread at ninepence a small loaf, meat at a prohibitive figure, and\r\nthe factories stopped, they were compelled to remain with empty stomachs\r\nand idle hands.\r\n\r\nBirmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, and the larger towns\r\npresented a gloomy, sorry aspect. Business was suspended, the majority\r\nof the shops were closed, the banks barred and bolted, and the only\r\nestablishments where any trade flourished were the taverns and music\r\nhalls. These were crowded. Drink flowed, gold jingled, and the laughter\r\nat wild jest or the thunder of applause which greeted dancing girls and\r\ncomic vocalists was still as hearty as of old. Everywhere there was a\r\nsordid craving for amusement which was a reflex of the war fever. The\r\npeople made merry, for ere long they might be cut down by a foeman's\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nRestless impatience thrilled the community from castle to cottage,\r\nintensified by the vain clamourings of Anarchist mobs in the greater\r\ntowns. As in London, these shock-headed agitators held high revel,\r\nprotesting against everything and everybody--now railing, now\r\nthreatening, but always mustering converts to their harebrained\r\ndoctrines. In Manchester they were particularly strong. A number of\r\nserious riots had occurred in Deansgate and in Market Street. The mob\r\nwrecked the Queen's Hotel, smashed numbers of windows in Lewis's great\r\nemporium, looted the _Guardian_ office, and set fire to the Town Hall. A\r\nportion of the latter only was burned, the fire brigade managing to\r\nsubdue the flames before any very serious damage was occasioned.\r\nAlthough the police made hundreds of arrests, and the stipendiary sat\r\nfrom early morning until late at night, Anarchist demonstrations were\r\nheld every evening in the city and suburbs, always resulting in\r\npillage, incendiarism, and not unfrequently in murder. In grey,\r\nmoney-making Stockport, in grimy Salford, in smoky Pendleton, and even\r\nin aristocratic Eccles, these demonstrations were held, and the\r\nself-styled \"soldiers of the social revolution\" marched over the granite\r\nroads, headed by a dirty scarlet flag, hounding down the Government, and\r\ncrying shame upon them for the apathy with which they had regarded the\r\npresence of the bearded Caucasian Tcherkesses of the White Tsar.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom was in wild turmoil, for horror heaped upon horror. Outrages\r\nthat commenced in London were repeated with appalling frequency in the\r\ngreat towns in the provinces. An attempt had been made to assassinate\r\nthe Premier while speaking in the Town Hall, Birmingham, the bomb which\r\nwas thrown having killed two hard-working reporters who were writing\r\nnear; but the Prime Minister, who seemed to lead a charmed existence,\r\nescaped without a scratch.\r\n\r\nIn Liverpool, where feeling against the War Office ran high, there were\r\nseveral explosions, two of which occurred in Bold Street, and were\r\nattended by loss of life, while a number of incendiary fires occurred at\r\nthe docks. At Bradford the Town Hall was blown up, and the troops were\r\ncompelled to fire on a huge mob of rioters, who, having assembled at\r\nManningham, were advancing to loot the town.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry barracks at York was the scene of a terrific explosion,\r\nwhich killed three sentries and maimed twenty other soldiers; while at\r\nWarwick Assizes, during the hearing of a murder trial, some unknown\r\nscoundrel threw a petard at the judge, killing him instantly on the\r\nbench.\r\n\r\nThese, however, were but few instances of the wild lawlessness and\r\nterrible anarchy that prevailed in Britain, for only the most flagrant\r\ncases of outrage were reported in the newspapers, their columns being\r\nfilled with the latest intelligence from the seat of war.\r\n\r\nIt must be said that over the border the people were more law-abiding.\r\nThe Scotch, too canny to listen to the fiery declamations of hoarse and\r\nshabby agitators, preferred to trust to British pluck and the strong arm\r\nof their brawny Highlanders. In Caledonia the seeds of Anarchy fell on\r\nstony ground.\r\n\r\nIn Northern and Midland towns, however, the excitement increased hourly.\r\nIt extended everywhere. From Ventnor to the Pentlands, from Holyhead to\r\nthe Humber, from Scilly to the Nore, every man and every woman existed\r\nin fearfulness of the crash that was impending.\r\n\r\nIt was now known throughout the breadth of our land that the Government\r\npolicy was faulty, that War Office and Admiralty organisation was a\r\nrotten make-believe, and, worst of all, that what critics had long ago\r\nsaid as to the inadequacy of our naval defence, even with the ships\r\nbuilt under the programme of 1894, had now, alas! proved to be true.\r\n\r\nThe suspense was awful. Those who were now living in the peaceful\r\natmospheres of their homes, surrounded by neighbours and friends in the\r\ncentre of a great town, and feeling a sense of security, might within a\r\nfew days be shot down by French rifles, or mowed down brutally by\r\ngleaming Cossack _shushkas_. The advance of the enemy was expected\r\ndaily, hourly; and the people in the North waited, staggered,\r\nbreathless, and terrified. Men eagerly scanned the newspapers; women\r\npressed their children to their breasts.\r\n\r\nIn the mining districts the shock had not inspired the same amount of\r\nfear as at the ports and in the manufacturing centres. Possibly it was\r\nbecause work was still proceeding in the pits, and constant work\r\nprevents men from becoming restless, or troubling themselves about a\r\nnation's woes. Toilers who worked below knew that foreign invaders had\r\nlanded, and that the Militia and Volunteers had been called out, but\r\nthey vaguely believed that, the seat of war being away down south--a\r\nvery long distance in the imagination of most of them--everything would\r\nbe over before they could be called upon to take part in the struggle.\r\nIn any case coal and iron must be got, they argued, and while they had\r\nwork they had little time for uneasiness. Nevertheless, great numbers of\r\nstalwart young miners enrolled themselves in the local Volunteer corps,\r\nand burned to avenge the affront to their country and their sovereign.\r\n\r\nThose were indeed fateful, ever-to-be-remembered days.\r\n\r\nAmid this weary, anxious watching, this constant dread of what might\r\nnext occur, an item of news was circulated which caused the greatest\r\nrejoicing everywhere. Intelligence reached New York, by cable from\r\nFrance, that Germany had combined with England against the\r\nFranco-Russian alliance, that her vast army had been mobilised, and that\r\nalready the brave, well-drilled legions of the Emperor William had\r\ncrossed the Vosges, and passed the frontier into France. A sharp battle\r\nhad been fought near Givet, and that, as well as several other French\r\nfrontier towns which fell in 1870, were again in the hands of the\r\nGermans.\r\n\r\nHow different were German methods to those of the British!\r\n\r\nWith a perfect scheme of attack, every detail of which had been long\r\nthought out, and which worked without a hitch, the Kaiser's forces were\r\nawaiting the word of command to march onward--to Paris. For years--ever\r\nsince they taught France that severe lesson in the last disastrous\r\nwar--it had been the ambition of every German cavalryman to clink his\r\nspurs on the asphalte of the Boulevards. Now they were actually on their\r\nway towards their goal!\r\n\r\nThe papers were full of these latest unexpected developments, the\r\ndetails of which, necessarily meagre owing to the lack of direct\r\ncommunication, were eagerly discussed. It was believed that Germany\r\nwould, in addition to defending her Polish frontier and attacking\r\nFrance, also send a naval squadron from Kiel to England.\r\n\r\nThe Tsar's spy had been foiled, and Russia and France now knew they had\r\nmade a false move! Russia's rapid and decisive movement was intended to\r\nprevent the signing of the secret alliance, and to bar England and\r\nGermany from joining hands. But happily the sly machinations of the\r\nCount von Beilstein, the released convict and adventurer, had in a\r\nmeasure failed, for Germany had considered it diplomatic to throw in\r\nher fortune with Great Britain in this desperate encounter.\r\n\r\nA feeling of thankfulness spread through the land. Nevertheless, it was\r\nplain that if Germany intended to wield the double-handled sword of\r\nconquest in France, she would have few troops to spare to send to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nBut those dark days, full of agonising suspense, dragged on slowly. The\r\nFrench well knew the imminent danger that threatened their own country,\r\nyet they could not possibly withdraw. Mad enthusiasts always!\r\n\r\nIt must be war to the death, they decided. The conflict could not be\r\naverted. So Britons unsheathed their steel, and held themselves in\r\nreadiness for a fierce and desperate fray.\r\n\r\nThe invasion had indeed been planned by our enemies with marvellous\r\nforethought and cunning. There was treachery in the Intelligence\r\nDepartment of the British Admiralty, foul treachery which placed our\r\ncountry at the mercy of the invader, and sacrificed thousands of lives.\r\nOn the morning following the sudden Declaration of War, the officer in\r\ncharge of the telegraph bureau at Whitehall, whose duty it had been to\r\nsend the telegrams ordering the naval mobilisation, was found lying dead\r\nbeside the telegraph instrument--stabbed to the heart! Inquiries were\r\nmade, and it was found that one of the clerks, a young Frenchman who had\r\nbeen taken on temporarily at a low salary, was missing. It was further\r\ndiscovered that the murder had been committed hours before, immediately\r\nthe Mobilisation Orders had been sent; further, that fictitious\r\ntelegrams had been despatched cancelling them, and ordering the Channel\r\nFleet away to the Mediterranean, the Coastguard Squadron to Land's End,\r\nand the first-class Reserve ships to proceed to the North of Scotland in\r\nsearch of the enemy! Thus, owing to these orders sent by the murderer,\r\nEngland was left unprotected.\r\n\r\nImmediately the truth was known efforts were made to cancel the forged\r\norders. But, alas! it was too late. Our Fleets had already sailed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCOUNT VON BEILSTEIN AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nKarl von Beilstein sat in his own comfortable saddlebag-chair, in his\r\nchambers in the Albany, lazily twisting a cigarette.\r\n\r\nOn a table at his elbow was spread sheet 319 of the Ordnance Survey Map\r\nof England, which embraced that part of Sussex where the enemy were\r\nencamped. With red and blue pencils he had been making mystic marks upon\r\nit, and had at last laid it aside with a smile of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"She thought she had me in her power,\" he muttered ominously to himself.\r\n\"The wolf! If she knew everything, she could make me crave again at her\r\nfeet for mercy. Happily she is in ignorance; therefore that trip to a\r\nmore salubrious climate that I anticipated is for the present postponed.\r\nI have silenced her, and am still master of the situation--still the\r\nagent of the Tsar!\" Uttering a low laugh, he gave his cigarette a final\r\ntwist, and then regarded it critically.\r\n\r\nThe door opened to admit his valet, Grevel.\r\n\r\n\"A message from the Embassy. The man is waiting,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHis master opened the note which was handed to him, read it with\r\ncontracted brows, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Tell him that the matter shall be arranged as quickly as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. I am leaving London, and shall not be back for a week--perhaps\r\nlonger.\"\r\n\r\nWith a slight yawn he rose and passed into his dressing-room, while his\r\nservant went to deliver his message to the man in waiting. The note had\r\nproduced a marked effect upon the spy. It was an order from his\r\ntaskmasters in St. Petersburg. He knew it must be obeyed. Every moment\r\nwas of vital consequence in carrying out the very delicate mission\r\nintrusted to him, a mission which it would require all his tact and\r\ncunning to execute.\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour he emerged into his sitting-room again, so\r\ncompletely disguised that even his most intimate acquaintances would\r\nhave failed to recognise him. Attired in rusty black, with clean shaven\r\nface and walking with a scholarly stoop, he had transformed himself from\r\nthe foppish man-about-town to a needy country parson, whose cheap boots\r\nwere down at heel, and in the lappel of whose coat was displayed a piece\r\nof worn and faded blue.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Pierre,\" he said to his man, who entered at his summons. \"While\r\nI am away keep your eyes and ears open. If there is a shadow of\r\nsuspicion in any quarter, burn all my papers, send me warning through\r\nthe Embassy, and clear out yourself without delay. Should matters assume\r\na really dangerous aspect, you must get down to the Russian lines, where\r\nthey will pass you through, and put you on board one of our ships.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has the Ministry at Petersburg promised us protection at last?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; we have nothing to fear. When the game is up among these lambs, we\r\nshall calmly go over to the other side and witness the fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what direction are you now going?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied the spy, as he unlocked a drawer in a small\r\ncabinet in a niche by the fireplace and took from it a long Circassian\r\nknife. Drawing the bright blade from its leathern sheath, he felt its\r\nkeen double edge with his fingers.\r\n\r\nIt was like a razor.\r\n\r\n\"A desperate errand--eh?\" queried the valet, with a grin, noticing how\r\ncarefully the Count placed the murderous weapon in his inner pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"Desperate. A word sometimes means death.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the simple rural vicar strode out and down the stairs, leaving the\r\ncrafty Pierre in wonderment.\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" the latter exclaimed in disgust, when the receding footsteps had\r\ndied away. \"So you vainly imagine, my dear Karl, that you have your heel\r\nupon my neck, do you? It is good for me that you don't give me credit\r\nfor being a little more wideawake, otherwise you would see that you are\r\nraking the chestnuts from the fire for me. _Bien!_ I am silent, docile,\r\nobedient; I merely wait for you to burn your fingers, then the whole of\r\nthe money will be mine to enjoy, while you will be in the only land\r\nwhere the Tsar does not require secret agents. Vain, avaricious fool!\r\n_You'll be in your grave!_\"\r\n\r\nVon Beilstein meanwhile sped along down the Haymarket and Pall Mall to\r\nWhitehall. The clock on the stone tower of the Horse Guards showed it\r\nwas one o'clock, and, with apparently aimless purpose, he lounged about\r\non the broad pavement outside Old Scotland Yard, immediately opposite\r\nthe dark facade of the Admiralty. His hawk's eye carefully scrutinised\r\nevery single person of the busy throng entering or leaving the building.\r\nThere was great activity at the naval headquarters, and the courtyard\r\nwas crowded with persons hurrying in and out. Presently, after a short\r\nbut vigilant watch, he turned quickly so as to be unobserved, and moved\r\nslowly away.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this sudden manoeuvre was the appearance of a well-dressed,\r\ndark-bearded man of about forty, having the appearance of a naval\r\nofficer in mufti, who emerged hastily from the building with a handbag\r\nin his hand, and crossed the courtyard to the kerb, where he stood\r\nlooking up and down the thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n\"My man!\" exclaimed von Beilstein, under his breath. \"He wants a cab. I\r\nwonder where he's going?\"\r\n\r\nFive minutes later the naval officer was in a hansom, driving towards\r\nWestminster Bridge, while, at a little distance behind, the Tsar's agent\r\nwas following in another conveyance. Once on the trail, the Count never\r\nleft his quarry. Crossing the bridge, they drove on rapidly through the\r\ncrowded, turbulent streets of South London to the Elephant and Castle,\r\nand thence down the Old Kent Road to the New Cross Station of the\r\nSouth-Eastern Railway.\r\n\r\nAs a protest against the action of the Government, and in order to\r\nprevent the enemy from establishing direct communication with London in\r\ncase of British reverses, the lines from the metropolis to the south had\r\nbeen wrecked by the Anarchists. On the Chatham and Dover Railway, Penge\r\ntunnel had been blown up, on the Brighton line two bridges near Croydon\r\nhad been similarly treated, and on the South-Eastern four bridges in\r\nRotherhithe and Bermondsey had been broken up and rendered impassable by\r\ndynamite, while at Haysden, outside Tunbridge, the rails had also been\r\ntorn up for a considerable distance. Therefore traffic to the south from\r\nLondon termini had been suspended, and the few persons travelling were\r\ncompelled to take train at the stations in the remoter southern suburbs.\r\n\r\nAs the unsuspecting officer stepped into the booking-office, his\r\nattention was not attracted by the quiet and seedy clergyman who lounged\r\nnear enough to overhear him purchase a first-class ticket for Deal. When\r\nhe had descended to the platform the spy obtained a third-class ticket\r\nto the same destination, and leisurely followed him. Travelling by the\r\nsame train, they were compelled to alight at Haysden and walk over the\r\nwrecked permanent way into Tunbridge, from which place they journeyed to\r\nDeal, arriving there about six o'clock. Throughout, it was apparent to\r\nthe crafty watcher that the man he was following was doing his utmost to\r\nescape observation, and this surmise was strengthened by his actions on\r\narriving at the quaint old town, now half ruined; for, instead of going\r\nto a first-class hotel, he walked on until he came to Middle Street,--a\r\nnarrow little thoroughfare, redolent of fish, running parallel with the\r\nsea,--and took up quarters at the Mariners' Rest Inn. It was a low,\r\nold-fashioned little place, with sanded floors, a smoke-blackened\r\ntaproom, a rickety time-mellowed bar, with a comfortable little parlour\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nIn this latter room, used in common by the guests, on the following day\r\nthe visitor from London first met the shabby parson from Canterbury. The\r\nman from the Admiralty seemed in no mood for conversation; nevertheless,\r\nafter a preliminary chat upon the prospect of the invasion, they\r\nexchanged cards, and the vicar gradually became confidential. With a\r\npious air he related how he had been to Canterbury to conduct a revival\r\nmission which had turned out marvellously successful, crowds having to\r\nbe turned away at every service, and how he was now enjoying a week's\r\nvacation before returning to his poor but extensive parish in\r\nHertfordshire.\r\n\r\n\"I came to this inn, because I am bound to practise a most rigid\r\neconomy,\" he added. \"I am charmed with it. One sees so much character\r\nhere in these rough toilers of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied his friend, whose card bore the words \"Commander Yerbery,\r\nR.N.\" \"Being a sailor myself, I prefer this homely little inn, with its\r\nfisher folk as customers, to a more pretentious and less comfortable\r\nestablishment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you remaining here long?\" asked his clerical friend.\r\n\r\n\"I--I really don't know,\" answered the officer hesitatingly. \"Possibly a\r\nday or so.\"\r\n\r\nThe spy did not pursue the subject further, but conducted himself with\r\nan amiability which caused his fellow-traveller to regard him as \"a real\r\ngood fellow for a parson.\" Together they smoked the long clays of the\r\nhostelry, they sat in the taproom of an evening and conversed with the\r\nfishermen who congregated there, and frequently strolled along by the\r\nshore to Walmer, or through the fields to Cottingham Court Farm, or\r\nSholden. Constantly, however, Commander Yerbery kept his eyes seaward.\r\nWas he apprehensive lest Russian ironclads should return, and again\r\nbombard the little town; or was he expecting some mysterious signal from\r\nsome ship in the Downs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nA DEATH DRAUGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn several occasions the spy had, with artful ingenuity, endeavoured to\r\ndiscover the object of Commander Yerbery's sojourn, but upon that point\r\nhe preserved a silence that was impenetrable. In their wanderings about\r\nthe town they saw on every side the havoc caused by the bombardment\r\nwhich had taken place three days previously. Whole rows of houses facing\r\nthe sea had been carried away by the enemy's shells, and the once\r\nhandsome church spire was now a mere heap of smouldering debris. The\r\nbarracks, which had been one of the objects of attack, had suffered most\r\nseverely. Melinite had been projected into them, exploding with\r\ndevastating effect, and demolishing the buildings, which fell like packs\r\nof cards. Afterwards, the enemy had sailed away, apparently thinking the\r\nstrategical position of the place worthless.\r\n\r\nAnd all this had been brought about by this despicable villain--the man\r\nwho had now wrapped himself in the cloak of sanctity, and who, beaming\r\nwith well-feigned good fellowship, walked arm-in-arm with the man upon\r\nwhom he was keeping the most vigilant observation! By night sleep\r\nscarcely came to his eyes, but in his little room, with its clean\r\nold-fashioned dimity blinds and hangings, he lay awake,--scheming,\r\nplanning, plotting, preparing for the master-stroke.\r\n\r\nOne morning, after they had been there three days, he stood alone in\r\nhis bedroom with the door closed. From his inner pocket he drew forth\r\nthe keen Circassian blade that reposed there, and gazed thoughtfully\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he muttered, suddenly rousing himself, as if a thought had\r\nsuddenly occurred to him. \"He is strong. He might shout, and then I\r\nshould be caught like a rat in a trap.\"\r\n\r\nReplacing the knife in his pocket, he took from his vest a tiny phial he\r\nalways carried; then, after noiselessly locking the door, he took from\r\nthe same pocket a small cube of lump sugar. Standing by the window he\r\nuncorked the little bottle, and with steady hand allowed one single drop\r\nof the colourless liquid to escape and fall upon the sugar, which\r\nquickly absorbed it, leaving a small darkened stain. This sugar he\r\nplaced in a locked drawer to dry, and, putting away the phial, descended\r\nto join his companion.\r\n\r\nThat night they were sitting together in the private parlour behind the\r\nbar, smoking and chatting. It was an old-fashioned, smoke-begrimed room,\r\nwith low oak ceiling and high wainscot,--a room in which many a seafarer\r\nhad found rest and comfort after the toils and perils of the deep, a\r\nroom in which many a stirring tale of the sea has been related, and in\r\nwhich one of our best-known nautical writers has gathered materials for\r\nhis stirring ocean romances.\r\n\r\nAlthough next the bar, there is no entrance on that side, neither is\r\nthere any glass, therefore the apartment is entirely secluded from the\r\npublic portion of the inn. At midnight the hearty Boniface and his wife\r\nand servant had retired, and the place was silent, but the officer and\r\nhis fellow-guest still sat with their pipes. The parson, as became one\r\nwho exhibited the blue pledge of temperance in his coat, sipped his\r\ncoffee, while the other had whisky, lemon, and a small jug of hot water\r\nbeside him. The spy had been using the sugar, and the basin was close to\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nHis companion presently made a movement to reach it, when the\r\npleasant-spoken vicar took up the tongs quickly, saying--\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to assist you. One lump?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thanks,\" replied the other, holding his glass for the small cube\r\nto be thrown in. Then he added the lemon, whisky, and hot water.\r\nBeilstein, betraying no excitement, continued the conversation, calmly\r\nrefilled his pipe, and watched his companion sip the deadly potion.\r\n\r\nKarl von Beilstein had reduced poisoning to a fine art.\r\n\r\nNot a muscle of his face contracted, though his keen eyes never left the\r\nother's countenance.\r\n\r\nThey talked on, the Commander apparently unaffected by the draught; his\r\nfriend smilingly complacent and confident.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without warning, the officer's face grew ashen pale and\r\nserious. A violent tremor shook his stalwart frame.\r\n\r\n\"I--I feel very strange,\" he cried, with difficulty. \"A most curious\r\nsensation has come over me--a sensation as if--as if--ah! heavens! Help,\r\nhelp!--I--I can't breathe!\"\r\n\r\nThe mild-mannered parson jumped to his feet, and stood before his\r\nfriend, watching the hideous contortions of his face.\r\n\r\n\"Assistance!\" his victim gasped, sinking inertly back in the high-backed\r\nWindsor arm-chair. \"Fetch me a doctor--quick.\"\r\n\r\nBut the man addressed took no heed of the appeal. He stood calmly by,\r\ncontemplating with satisfaction his villainous work.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you see--I'm ill?\" the dying man cried in a feeble, piteous\r\nvoice. \"My throat and head are burning. Give me water--_water_!\"\r\n\r\nStill the spy remained motionless.\r\n\r\n\"You--you refuse to assist me--you scoundrel! Ah!\" he cried hoarsely, in\r\ndismay. \"Ah! I see it all now! _God! You've poisoned me!_\"\r\n\r\nWith a frantic effort he half-raised himself in his chair, but fell back\r\nin a heap; his arms hanging helplessly at his side. His breath came and\r\nwent in short hard gasps; the death-rattle was already in his throat,\r\nand with one long deep-drawn sigh the last breath left the body, and the\r\nlight gradually died out of the agonised face.\r\n\r\nQuick as thought the Count unbuttoned the dead man's coat, and\r\nsearching his pockets took out a large white official envelope bearing\r\nin the corner the blue stamp of the Admiralty. It was addressed to \"Sir\r\nMichael Culme-Seymour, Admiral commanding the Channel Squadron,\" and was\r\nmarked \"Private.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" ejaculated the spy, as he tore open the envelope. \"I was not\r\nmistaken, after all! He was waiting until the flagship came into the\r\nDowns to deliver it.\"\r\n\r\nThe envelope contained a letter accompanied by a chart of the South\r\nCoast, upon which were certain marks at intervals in red with minute\r\ndirections, as well as a copy of the code of secret signals in which\r\nsome slight alterations had lately been made.\r\n\r\n\"What fortune!\" cried the Count gleefully, after reading the note.\r\n\"Their plans and the secret of their signals, too, are now ours! The\r\nEmbassy were correct in their surmise. With these the French and Russian\r\nships will be able to act swiftly, and sweep the British from the sea.\r\nNow for London as quickly as possible, for the information will be\r\nabsolutely invaluable.\"\r\n\r\nWithout a final glance at the corpse, huddled up in its chair, he put on\r\nhis hat, and stealing noiselessly from the house, set out in the\r\nmoonlight to walk swiftly by way of Great Mongeham and Waldershare to\r\nShepherd's Well station, whence he could get by train to London.\r\n\r\nThe immense importance of these secret documents he had not overrated.\r\nTheir possession would enable the Russian ships to decipher many of the\r\nhitherto mysterious British signals.\r\n\r\nThe spy had accomplished his mission!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE MASSACRE AT EASTBOURNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHourly the most alarming reports were being received at the War Office,\r\nand at newspaper offices throughout the country, of the\r\nrapidly-increasing forces of the invaders, who were still landing in\r\nenormous numbers. Vague rumours were also afloat of desperate encounters\r\nat sea between our Coastguard Squadron that had returned and the French\r\nand Russian ironclads.\r\n\r\nNothing definite, however, was known. News travelled slowly, and was\r\nalways unreliable.\r\n\r\nMobilisation was being hurried forward with all possible speed.\r\nNevertheless, so sudden had been the descent of the enemy, that\r\nEastbourne, Newhaven, and Seaford had already fallen into their hands.\r\nInto the half-wrecked town of Eastbourne regiment after regiment of\r\nRussian infantry had been poured by the transports _Samojed_ and\r\n_Artelscik_, while two regiments of dragoons, one of Cossacks, and many\r\nmachine-gun sections had also been landed, in addition to a quantity of\r\nFrench infantry from the other vessels. The streets of the usually\r\nclean, well-ordered town were strewn with the debris of fallen houses\r\nand shops that had been wrecked by Russian shells. The Queen's Hotel at\r\nSplash Point, with its tiers of verandahs and central spire, stood out a\r\ngreat gaunt blackened ruin.\r\n\r\nAlong Terminus Road the grey-coated hordes of the Great White Tsar\r\nlooted the shops, and showed no quarter to those who fell into their\r\nhands. The Grand Hotel, the Burlington, the Cavendish, and others, were\r\nquickly transformed into barracks, as well as the half-ruined Town Hall,\r\nand the Floral Hall at Devonshire Park.\r\n\r\nRobbery, outrage, and murder ran riot in the town, which only a few days\r\nbefore had been a fashionable health resort, crowded by aristocratic\r\nidlers. Hundreds of unoffending persons had been killed by the merciless\r\nfire from the enemy's battleships, and hundreds more were being shot\r\ndown in the streets for attempting a feeble resistance. The inhabitants,\r\nsurrounded on all sides by the enemy, were powerless.\r\n\r\nThe huge guns of the _Pamyat Azova_, the _Imperator Nicolai I._, the\r\n_Pjotr Velikij_, the _Krejser_, the _Najezdnik_, and others, had belched\r\nforth their death-dealing missiles with an effect that was appalling.\r\n\r\nThe thunder of cannon had ceased, but was now succeeded by the sharp\r\ncracking of Russian rifles, as those who, desperately guarding their\r\nhomes and their loved ones, and making a stand against the invaders,\r\nwere shot down like dogs. A crowd of townspeople collected in the open\r\nspace outside the railway station, prepared to bar the advance of the\r\nRussians towards the Old Town and Upperton. Alas! it was a forlorn hope\r\nfor an unarmed mob to attempt any such resistance.\r\n\r\nA Russian officer suddenly shouted a word of command that brought a\r\ncompany of infantry to the halt, facing the crowd. Another word and a\r\nhundred rifles were discharged. Again and again they flashed, and the\r\nvolley was repeated until the streets were covered with dead and dying,\r\nand the few who were not struck turned and fled, leaving the invaders to\r\nadvance unopposed.\r\n\r\nHorrible were the deeds committed that night. English homes were\r\ndesecrated, ruined, and burned. Babes were murdered before the eyes of\r\ntheir parents, many being impaled by gleaming Russian bayonets; fathers\r\nwere shot down in the presence of their wives and children, and sons\r\nwere treated in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDING OF RUSSIANS, AND MASSACRE IN TERMINUS ROAD,\r\nEASTBOURNE.]\r\n\r\nThe massacre was frightful. Ruin and desolation were on every hand.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers of the Tsar, savage and inhuman, showed no mercy to the\r\nweak and unprotected. They jeered and laughed at piteous appeal, and\r\nwith fiendish brutality enjoyed the destruction which everywhere they\r\nwrought.\r\n\r\nMany a cold-blooded murder was committed, many a brave Englishman fell\r\nbeneath the heavy whirling sabres of Circassian Cossacks, the bayonets\r\nof French infantry, or the deadly hail of machine guns. Battalion after\r\nbattalion of the enemy, fierce and ruthless, clambered on over the\r\ndebris in Terminus Road, enthusiastic at finding their feet upon English\r\nsoil. The flames of the burning buildings in various parts of the town\r\nilluminated the place with a bright red glare that fell upon dark\r\nbearded faces, in every line of which was marked determination and\r\nfierce hostility. Landing near Langney Point, many of the battalions\r\nentered the town from the east, destroying all the property they came\r\nacross on their line of advance, and, turning into Terminus Road, then\r\ncontinued through Upperton and out upon the road leading to Willingdon.\r\n\r\nThe French forces, who came ashore close to Holywell, on the other side\r\nof the town, advanced direct over Warren Hill, and struck due north\r\ntowards Sheep Lands.\r\n\r\nAt about a mile from the point where the road from Eastdean crosses that\r\nto Jevington, the force encamped in a most advantageous position upon\r\nWillingdon Hill, while the Russians who advanced direct over St.\r\nAnthony's Hill, and those who marched through Eastbourne, united at a\r\npoint on the Lewes Road near Park Farm, and after occupying Willingdon\r\nvillage, took up a position on the high ground that lies between it and\r\nJevington.\r\n\r\nFrom a strategic point of view the positions of both forces were\r\ncarefully chosen. The commanding officers were evidently well acquainted\r\nwith the district, for while the French commanded Eastbourne and a wide\r\nstretch of the Downs, the Russians also had before them an extensive\r\ntract of country extending in the north to Polegate, in the west to the\r\nFore Down and Lillington, and in the east beyond Willingdon over\r\nPevensey Levels to the sea.\r\n\r\nDuring the night powerful search-lights from the French and Russian\r\nships swept the coast continually, illuminating the surrounding hills\r\nand lending additional light to the ruined and burning town. Before the\r\nsun rose, however, the majority of the invading vessels had rounded\r\nBeachy Head, and had steamed away at full speed down Channel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING THE POINTS WHERE THE INVADERS LANDED.]\r\n\r\nDaylight revealed the grim realities of war. It showed Eastbourne with\r\nits handsome buildings scorched and ruined, its streets blocked by\r\nfallen walls, and trees which had once formed shady boulevards torn up\r\nand broken, its shops looted, its tall church steeples blown away, its\r\nrailway station wrecked, and its people massacred. Alas! their\r\nlife-blood was wet upon the pavements.\r\n\r\nThe French and Russian legions, ever increasing, covered the hills. The\r\nheavy guns of the French artillery and the lighter but more deadly\r\nmachine guns of the Russians had already been placed in position, and\r\nwere awaiting the order to move north and commence the assault on\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nIt was too late! Nothing could now be done to improve the rotten state\r\nof our defences. The invasion had begun, and Britain, handicapped alike\r\non land and on sea, must arm and fight to the death.\r\n\r\nBy Tuesday night, three days after the Declaration of War, two French\r\nand half a Russian army corps, amounting to 90,000 officers and men,\r\nwith 10,000 horses and 1500 guns and waggons, had landed, in addition to\r\nwhich reinforcements constantly arrived from the French Channel and\r\nRussian Baltic ports, until the number of the enemy on English soil was\r\nestimated at over 300,000.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming descent on our shores had been secretly planned by the\r\nenemy with great forethought, every detail having been most carefully\r\narranged. The steam tonnage in the French harbours was ample and to\r\nspare, for many of the vessels, being British, had been at once seized\r\non the outbreak of hostilities. The sudden interruption of the mail and\r\ntelegraphic services between the two countries left us in total\r\nignorance of the true state of affairs. Nevertheless, for weeks an army\r\nof carpenters and engineers had been at work preparing the necessary\r\nfittings, which were afterwards placed in position on board the ships\r\ndestined to convey horses and men to England.\r\n\r\nIn order to deceive the other Powers, a large number of military\r\ntransport vessels had been fitted out at Brest for a bogus expedition to\r\nDahomey. These ships actually put to sea on the day previous to the\r\nDeclaration of War, and on Saturday night, at the hour when the news\r\nreached Britain, they had already embarked guns, horses, and waggons at\r\nthe Channel ports. Immediately after the Tsar's manifesto had been\r\nissued the Russian Volunteer Fleet was mobilised, and transports which\r\nhad long been held in readiness in the Baltic harbours embarked men and\r\nguns, and, one after another, steamed away for England without the\r\nslightest confusion or any undue haste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nIN THE EAGLE'S TALONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany British military and naval writers had ridiculed the idea of a\r\nsurprise invasion without any attempt on the part of the enemy to gain\r\nmore than a partial and temporary control of the Channel. Although an\r\nattack on territory without having previously command of the sea had\r\ngenerally been foredoomed to failure, it had been long ago suggested by\r\ncertain military officers in the course of lectures at the United\r\nService Institution, that under certain conditions such invasion was\r\npossible, and that France might ere long be ruled by some ambitious\r\nsoldier who might be tempted to try a sudden dash on _le perfide\r\nAlbion_. They pointed out that at worst it would entail on France the\r\nloss of three or four army corps, a loss no greater than she would\r\nsuffer in one short land campaign. But alas! at that time very little\r\nnotice was taken of such criticisms and illustrations, for Britons had\r\nalways been prone to cast doubts upon the power of other nations to\r\nconvey troops by sea, to embark them, or to land them. Thus the many\r\nsuggestions directed towards increasing the mobility and efficiency of\r\nthe Army were, like other warnings, cast aside, the prevailing opinion\r\nin the country being that sudden invasion was an absolute impossibility.\r\n\r\nPredictions of prophets that had so long been scorned, derided, and\r\ndisregarded by an apathetic British public were rapidly being fulfilled.\r\nComing events had cast dark shadows that had been unheeded, and now the\r\nunexpected bursting of the war cloud produced panic through our land.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sir Archibald Alison struck an alarming note of warning when he\r\nwrote in _Blackwood_ in December 1893: \"No one can look carefully into\r\nthe present state of Europe without feeling convinced that it cannot\r\ncontinue long in its present condition. Every country is maintaining an\r\narmed force out of all proportion to its resources and population, and\r\nthe consequent strain upon its monetary system and its industrial\r\npopulation is ever increasing, and must sooner or later become\r\nunbearable.\"\r\n\r\nIt had never been sufficiently impressed upon the British public, that\r\nwhen mobilised for war, and with all the Reserves called out, Russia had\r\nat her command 2,722,000 officers and men, while France could put\r\n2,715,000 into the field, making a total force of the Franco-Russian\r\nArmies of 5,437,000 men, with 9920 field guns and 1,480,000 horses.\r\n\r\nThis well-equipped force was almost equal to the combined Armies of the\r\nTriple Alliance, Germany possessing 2,441,000, Austria 1,590,000, and\r\nItaly 1,909,000, a total of 5,940,000 officers and men, with 8184 field\r\nguns and 813,996 horses.\r\n\r\nBeside these enormous totals, how ridiculously small appeared the\r\nBritish Army, with its Regular forces at home and abroad amounting to\r\nonly 211,600 of all ranks, 225,400 Volunteers, and 74,000 Reserves, or\r\n511,000 fighting men! Of these, only 63,000 Regulars remained in England\r\nand Wales, therefore our Reserves and Volunteers were the chief\r\ndefenders of our homes.\r\n\r\nWhat a mere handful they appeared side by side with these huge European\r\nArmies!\r\n\r\nWas it not surprising that in such circumstances the constant warnings\r\nregarding the weakness of our Navy--the force upon which the very life\r\nof our Empire depended--should have been unheeded by the too confident\r\npublic?\r\n\r\nWhen we were told plainly by a well-known authority that the number of\r\nour war vessels was miserably inadequate, that we were 10,000 men and\r\n1000 officers short, and, among other things, that a French cruiser\r\nhad, for all practical purposes, three times the fighting efficiency of\r\nan English cruiser, no one troubled. Nor was any one aroused from his\r\nfoolishly apathetic confidence in British supremacy at sea. True, our\r\nNavy was strengthened to a certain extent in 1894, but hard facts,\r\nsolemn warnings, gloomy forebodings, all were, alas! cast aside among\r\nthe \"scares\" which crop up periodically in the press during a\r\nParliamentary recess, and which, on the hearing of a murder trial, or a\r\nSociety scandal, at once fizzle out and are dismissed for ever.\r\n\r\nOn this rude awakening to the seriousness of the situation, Service men\r\nnow remembered distinctly the prophetic words of the few students of\r\nprobable invasion. Once they had regarded them as based on wild\r\nimprobabilities, but now they admitted that the facts were as\r\nrepresented, and that critics had foreseen catastrophe.\r\n\r\nAlready active steps had been taken towards the defence of London.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the serious defects in the mobilisation scheme, the 1st\r\nArmy Corps, formed at Aldershot under Sir Evelyn Wood, and three cavalry\r\nbrigades, were now in the field, while the other army corps were being\r\nrapidly conveyed southwards.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the Field Army, the Volunteers had mobilised, and were\r\noccupying the lines north and south of the metropolis. This force of\r\nVolunteer infantry consisted of 108,300 officers and men, of whom\r\n73,000, with 212 guns, were placed on the line south of the Thames.\r\n\r\nIt stretched along the hills from Guildford in Surrey to Halstead in\r\nKent, with intermediate concentration points at Box Hill and Caterham.\r\nAt the latter place an efficient garrison had been established,\r\nconsisting of 4603 of all ranks of the North London Brigade, 4521 of the\r\nWest London, 5965 of the South London, 5439 of the Surrey, and 6132 of\r\nthe Lancashire and Cheshire. This force was backed by eleven 16-pounder\r\nbatteries of the 1st Norfolk from Yarmouth, the 1st Sussex from\r\nBrighton, the 1st Newcastle and the 2nd Durham from Seaham, and ten\r\n40-pounder batteries of the 3rd and 6th Lancashire from Liverpool, the\r\n9th Lancashire from Bolton, the 1st Cheshire from Chester, the 1st\r\nCinque Ports from Dover, and the 2nd Cinque Ports from St. Leonards. At\r\nHalstead, on the left flank, there were massed about 20,470 Volunteer\r\ninfantry, these being made up of the South Wales Brigade 4182, Welsh\r\nBorder 5192, the North Midland 5225, and the South Midland 5970. The\r\neleven 16-pounder batteries came from the Woolwich Arsenal, Monmouth,\r\nShropshire, and Stafford Corps, and five 40-pounder batteries from the\r\nPreston Corps.\r\n\r\nTo Guildford 4471 infantry in the Home Counties Brigade and 4097 in the\r\nWestern Counties were assigned, while the guns consisted of four\r\n40-pounder batteries from the York and Leeds Corps, the 16-pounder\r\nbatteries of the Fife, Highland, and Midlothian Corps being unable, as\r\nyet, to get south on account of the congested state of all the northern\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\nFor this same reason, too, the force at Box Hill, the remaining post in\r\nthe south line of defence, was a very weak one. To this the Volunteers\r\nassigned were mostly Scottish.\r\n\r\nOf the Glasgow Brigade 8000 of all ranks arrived, with 4000 from the\r\nSouth of Scotland Brigade; but the Highland Brigade of 4400 men, all\r\nenthusiastically patriotic, and the 16-pounder batteries from Ayr and\r\nLanark, were compelled, to their chagrin, to wait at their headquarters\r\nfor several days before the railways--every resource of which was\r\nstrained to their utmost limits--could move them forward to the seat of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe five heavy batteries of the Aberdeen and North York Corps succeeded\r\nin getting down to their place of concentration early, as likewise did\r\nthe 16-pounder battery from Galloway. Volunteers also undertook the\r\ndefences north of the metropolis, and a strong line, consisting of a\r\nnumber of provincial brigades, stretched from Tilbury to Brentwood and\r\nEpping.\r\n\r\nThe British Volunteer holds no romantic notions of \"death or glory,\" but\r\nis none the less prepared to do his duty, and is always ready \"to do\r\nanything, and to go anywhere.\" Every officer and every man of this great\r\nforce which had mounted guard north and south of the Thames was resolved\r\nto act his part bravely, and, if necessary, lay down his life for his\r\ncountry's honour.\r\n\r\nAt their posts on the Surrey Hills, ready at any moment to go into\r\naction, and firmly determined that no invader should enter the vast\r\nCapital of the World, they impatiently awaited the development of the\r\nsituation, eager to face and annihilate their foreign foe.\r\n\r\nBritannia had always been justly proud of her Volunteer forces, although\r\ntheir actual strength in time of invasion had never before been\r\ndemonstrated. Now, however, the test which had been applied showed that,\r\nwith an exception of rarest occurrence, every man had responded to this\r\nhasty call to arms, and that on active service they were as fearless and\r\ncourageous as any body of Regulars ever put in the field.\r\n\r\nEvery man was alive to Britain's danger; every man knew well how\r\nterrible would be the combat--the struggle that must result in either\r\nvictory or death.\r\n\r\nThe double-headed Eagle had set his talons in British soil!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nFIERCE FIGHTING IN THE CHANNEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Channel disastrous events of a most exciting character were now\r\nrapidly occurring.\r\n\r\nOutside Seaford Bay, Pevensey Bay, and off Brighton and the Mares at\r\nCuckmere Haven, the enemy's transports, having landed troops and stores,\r\nrode at anchor, forming a line of retreat in case of reverses, while\r\nmany fast French cruisers steamed up and down, keeping a sharp lookout\r\nfor any British merchant or mail steamers which, ignorant of the\r\nhostilities, entered the Channel.\r\n\r\nThe officers and crews of these steamers were in most cases so utterly\r\nsurprised that they fell an easy prey to the marauding vessels, many\r\nbeing captured and taken to French ports without a shot being fired.\r\nOther vessels, on endeavouring to escape, were either overhauled or sunk\r\nby the heavy fire of pursuing cruisers. One instance was that of the\r\nfast mail steamer _Carpathian_, belonging to the Union Steamship\r\nCompany, which, entering the Channel on a voyage from Cape Town to\r\nSouthampton, was attacked off the Eddystone by the Russian armoured\r\ncruiser _Gerzog Edinburskij_. The panic on board was indescribable, over\r\na hundred steerage passengers being killed or mutilated by the shells\r\nfrom the bow guns of the cruiser, and the captain himself being blown to\r\natoms by an explosion which occurred when a shot struck and carried away\r\nthe forward funnel. After an exciting chase, the _Carpathian_ was sunk\r\nnear Start Point, and of the five hundred passengers and crew scarcely a\r\nsingle person survived.\r\n\r\nThis terrible work of destruction accomplished, the Russian cruiser\r\nturned westward again to await further prey. As she steamed away,\r\nhowever, another ship rounded the Start following at full speed in her\r\nwake. This vessel, which was flying the British flag, was the\r\nbarbette-ship _Centurion_. Already her captain had witnessed the attack\r\nand sinking of the _Carpathian_, but from a distance too great to enable\r\nhim to assist the defenceless liner, and he was now on his way to attack\r\nthe Tsar's cruiser. Almost immediately she was noticed by the enemy.\r\nHalf an hour later she drew within range, and soon the two ships were\r\nengaged in a most desperate encounter. The gunners on the _Centurion_,\r\nseeing the Russian cross flying defiantly, and knowing the frightful\r\nhavoc already wrought on land by the enemy, worked with that pluck and\r\nindomitable energy characteristic of the Britisher. Shot after shot was\r\nexchanged, but hissed and splashed without effect until the ships drew\r\nnearer, and then nearly every shell struck home. The rush of flame from\r\nthe quick-firing guns of the _Centurion_ was continuous, and the firing\r\nwas much more accurate than that of her opponent, nevertheless the\r\nlatter was manipulated with remarkable skill.\r\n\r\nThe roar of the guns was deafening. Clouds of smoke rose so thickly that\r\nthe vessels could scarcely distinguish each other. But the firing was\r\nalmost continuous, until suddenly a shell struck the _Centurion_ abaft\r\nthe funnel, and for a moment stilled her guns.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not for long, for in a few moments she recovered from\r\nthe shock, and her guns were again sending forth shells with regularity\r\nand precision. Again a shell struck the _Centurion_, this time carrying\r\naway one of her funnels and killing a large number of men.\r\n\r\nThe British captain, still as cool as if standing on the hearthrug of\r\nthe smoking-room of the United Service Club, took his vessel closer,\r\ncontinuing the fire, heedless of the fact that the Russian shells\r\nstriking his ship were playing such fearful havoc with it. Every\r\npreparation had been made for a desperate fight to the death, when\r\nsuddenly a shot struck the vessel, causing her to reel and shiver.\r\n\r\nSo well had the Russians directed their fire that the British vessel\r\ncould not reply. One of her 29-tonners had been blown completely off its\r\ncarriage, and lay shattered with men dead all around, while two of her\r\nquick-firing broadside guns had been rendered useless, and she had\r\nsustained other injuries of a very serious character, besides losing\r\nnearly half her men.\r\n\r\nShe was silent, riding to the swell, when wild exultant shouts in\r\nRussian went up from the enemy's ship, mingling with the heavy fire they\r\nstill kept up.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, however, even while the victorious shouts resounded, the\r\ncaptain of the _Centurion_, still cool and collected, swung round his\r\nvessel, and turning, touched one of the electric knobs at his hand. As\r\nhe did so a long silvery object shot noiselessly from the side of the\r\nship, and plunged with a splash into the rising waves.\r\n\r\nSeconds seemed hours. For a whole three minutes the captain waited;\r\nthen, disappointed, he turned away with an expression of impatience. The\r\ntorpedo had missed its mark, and every moment lost might determine their\r\nfate. With guns still silent he again adroitly manoeuvred his ship. Once\r\nagain he touched the electric knob, and again a torpedo, released from\r\nits tube, sped rapidly through the water.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a dull and muffled explosion from the Russian cruiser sounded.\r\nAbove the dense smoke a flame shot high, with great columns of spray, as\r\nthe guns suddenly ceased their thunder.\r\n\r\nThere was a dead stillness, broken only by the wash of the sea.\r\n\r\nThen the smoke clearing showed the debris of the _Gerzog Edinburskij_\r\nfast sinking beneath the restless waters. Some splinters precipitated\r\ninto the air had fallen with loud splashes in every direction, and amid\r\nthe victorious shouts of the British bluejackets the disabled ship, with\r\nits fluttering Russian cross, slowly disappeared for ever, carrying down\r\nevery soul on board.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo, striking her amidships, had blown an enormous hole right\r\nthrough her double bottom, and torn her transverse bulkheads away so\r\nmuch that her watertight doors were useless for keeping her afloat, even\r\nfor a few minutes.\r\n\r\nPartially crippled as she was, the _Centurion_ steamed slowly westward,\r\nuntil at noon on the following day she fell in with a division of the\r\nCoastguard Squadron, which, acting under the fictitious telegraphic\r\norders of the French spy, had been to Land's End, but which, now the\r\nenemy had landed, had received genuine orders from the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nCompared with the number and strength of the French and Russian vessels\r\nmustered in the Channel, this force was so small as to appear ludicrous.\r\nTo send this weak defending division against the mighty power of the\r\ninvaders was sheer madness, and everybody on board knew it. The vessels\r\nwere weaker in every detail than those of the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt full speed the British vessels steamed on throughout that day, until\r\nat 8 P.M., when about twenty miles south of Selsey Bill, they were\r\njoined by forces from the Solent. These consisted of the turret-ship\r\n_Monarch_, the turret-ram _Rupert_, the barbette-ship _Rodney_, the\r\nbelted cruiser _Aurora_, and the coast defence armour-clads _Cyclops_\r\nand _Gorgon_, together with a number of torpedo boats. The night was\r\ncalm, but moonless, and without delay the vessels all continued the\r\nvoyage up Channel silently, with lights extinguished.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later the officers noticed that away on the horizon a light\r\nsuddenly flashed twice and then disappeared.\r\n\r\nOne of the enemy's ships had signalled the approach of the defenders!\r\n\r\nThis caused the British Admiral to alter his course slightly, and the\r\nvessels steamed along in the direction the light had shown.\r\n\r\nIn turrets and in broadside batteries there was a deep hush of\r\nexpectation. Officers and men standing at their quarters scarcely spoke.\r\nAll felt the fight must be most desperate.\r\n\r\nPresently, in the far distance a small patch of light in the sky showed\r\nthe direction of Brighton, and almost immediately the Admiral signalled\r\nto the cruisers _Aurora_, _Galatea_, and _Narcissus_, and the new\r\nbattleship _Hannibal_, built under the 1894 programme, to detach\r\nthemselves with six torpedo boats, and take an easterly course, in order\r\nto carry out instructions which he gave. These tactics caused\r\nconsiderable comment.\r\n\r\nThe orders were to make straight for Eastbourne, and to suddenly attack\r\nand destroy any of the hostile transports that were lying there, the\r\nobject being twofold--firstly, to cut off the enemy's line of retreat,\r\nand secondly, to prevent the vessels from being used for the purpose of\r\nlanding further reinforcements.\r\n\r\nSoon after 2 A.M. this gallant little division had, by careful\r\nmanoeuvring, and assisted by a slight mist which now hung over the sea,\r\nrounded Beachy Head without being discovered, and had got outside\r\nPevensey Bay about eight miles from land. Here a number of Russian\r\ntransports and service steamers were lying, among them being the\r\n_Samojed_ and _Olaf_, _Krasnaya Gorka_ and _Vladimir_, with two smaller\r\nones--the _Dnepr_ and the _Artelscik_.\r\n\r\nSilently, and without showing any lights, a British torpedo boat sped\r\nquickly along to where the dark outline of a ship loomed through the\r\nmist, and, having ascertained that it was the _Olaf_, drew up quickly.\r\n\r\nA few minutes elapsed, all being quiet. Then suddenly a bright flash was\r\nfollowed by a fearful explosion, and the bottom of the Tsar's vessel\r\nbeing completely ripped up by the torpedo, she commenced to settle down\r\nimmediately, before any of those on board could save themselves. The\r\nenemy had scarcely recovered from their surprise and confusion when\r\nthree other loud explosions occurred, and in each case transport vessels\r\nwere blown up. British torpedo boats, darting hither and thither between\r\nthe Russian ships, were dealing terrible blows from which no vessel\r\ncould recover. So active were they, indeed, that within the space of\r\nfifteen minutes six transports had been blown up, as well as the\r\nfirst-class torpedo boat _Abo_. The loss of life was terrible.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the first explosion, the guns of the _Aurora_,\r\n_Galatea_, and _Narcissus_ thundered out a terrible salute. The bright\r\nsearch-lights of the Russian cruisers and of the battleship _Navarin_\r\nimmediately swept the sea, and through the mist discerned the British\r\nships. The lights served only to show the latter the exact position of\r\nthe enemy, and again our guns belched forth shot and shell with\r\ndisastrous effect.\r\n\r\nQuickly, however, the Russian vessels replied. Flame flashed\r\ncontinuously from the turret of the _Navarin_ and the port guns of the\r\n_Opricnik_ and the _Najezdnik_, while the search-lights were at the same\r\ntime shut off.\r\n\r\nAt first the fire was very ineffectual, but gradually as the vessels\r\ncrept closer to each other the encounter became more and more desperate.\r\n\r\nThe Russian torpedo boats _Vzryv_, _Vindava_, and _Kotlinj_ were\r\nimmediately active, and the _Narcissus_ had a very narrow escape, a\r\nWhitehead torpedo passing right under her bows, while one British\r\ntorpedo boat, which at the same moment was endeavouring to launch its\r\ndeadly projectile at the _Navarin_, was sent to the bottom by a single\r\nshot from the _Najezdnik_.\r\n\r\nThe combat was desperate and terrible. That the British had been already\r\nsuccessful in surprising and sinking a torpedo boat and six of the\r\nhostile transports was true; nevertheless the number of Russian ships\r\nlying there was much greater than the British Admiral had anticipated,\r\nand, to say the least, the four vessels now found themselves in a most\r\ncritical position.\r\n\r\nThe _Navarin_ alone was one of the most powerful of the Tsar's\r\nbattleships, and, in addition to the seven cruisers and nine torpedo\r\nboats, comprised an overwhelming force.\r\n\r\nYet the English warships held their own, pouring forth an incessant\r\nfire. Each gun's crew knew they were face to face with death, but,\r\ninspired by the coolness of their officers, they worked on calmly and\r\nindefatigably. Many of their shots went home with frightful effect. One\r\nshell which burst over the magazine of the _Lieut. Iljin_ ripped up her\r\ndeck and caused severe loss of life, while in the course of half an hour\r\none of the heavy turret guns of the _Navarin_ had been disabled, and\r\ntwo more Russian torpedo boats sunk. Our torpedo boat destroyers\r\noperating on the Channel seaboard were performing excellent work, the\r\n_Havock_, _Shark_, _Hornet_, _Dart_, _Bruiser_, _Hasty_, _Teaser_,\r\n_Janus_, _Surly_, and _Porcupine_ all being manoeuvred with splendid\r\nsuccess. Several, however, were lost while sweeping out the enemy's\r\ntorpedo boat shelters, including the _Ardent_, _Charger_, _Boxer_, and\r\n_Rocket_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SINKING OF H.M.S. \"AURORA\" BY A TORPEDO: \"THE CRUISER\r\nROSE AS IF SHE HAD RIDDEN OVER A VOLCANO.\"]\r\n\r\nBut the British vessels were now suffering terribly, hemmed in as they\r\nwere by the enemy, with shells falling upon them every moment, and their\r\ndecks swept by the withering fire of machine guns. Suddenly, after a\r\nshell had burst in the stern of the _Aurora_, she ceased firing and\r\nswung round, almost colliding with the _Narcissus_. Her steam\r\nsteering-gear had, alas! been broken by the shot, and for a few moments\r\nher officers lost control over her.\r\n\r\nA Russian torpedo boat in shelter behind the _Navarin_, now seeing its\r\nchance, darted out and launched its projectile.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the _Aurora_, aware of their danger, seemed utterly\r\npowerless to avert it. It was a terrible moment. A few seconds later the\r\ntorpedo struck, the cruiser rose as if she had ridden over a volcano,\r\nand then, as she gradually settled down, the dark sea rolled over as\r\ngallant a crew as ever sailed beneath the White Ensign.\r\n\r\nImmediately afterwards the _Navarin_ exchanged rapid signals with a\r\nnumber of ships which were approaching with all speed from the direction\r\nof Hastings, and the captains of the three remaining British vessels saw\r\nthat they had fallen into a trap.\r\n\r\nThe _Narcissus_ had been drawn between two fires. Both her funnels had\r\nbeen shot away, two of her broadside guns were useless, and she had\r\nsustained damage to her engines; nevertheless, her captain, with the\r\ndogged perseverance of a British sailor, continued the desperate combat.\r\nWith the first flush of dawn the fog had lifted, but there was scarcely\r\nsufficient wind to spread out the British ensign, which still waved with\r\nlazy defiance.\r\n\r\nOn one side of her was the ponderous _Navarin_, from the turret of which\r\nshells were projected with monotonous regularity, while on the other the\r\nBritish cruiser was attacked vigorously by the _Najezdnik_. The\r\n_Narcissus_, however, quickly showed the Russians what she could do\r\nagainst such overwhelming odds, for presently she sent a shot from one\r\nof her 20-ton guns right under the turret of the _Navarin_, causing a\r\nmost disastrous explosion on board that vessel, while, at the same time,\r\nher 6-inch breechloaders pounded away at her second antagonist, and sank\r\na torpedo boat manoeuvring near.\r\n\r\nBoth the _Galatea_ and the _Hannibal_ were in an equally serious\r\npredicament. The enemy's torpedo boats swarmed around them, while the\r\ncruisers _Opricnik_, _Admiral Korniloff_, _Rynda_, and several other\r\nvessels, kept up a hot, incessant fire, which was returned energetically\r\nby the British vessels.\r\n\r\nThe sight was magnificent, appalling! In the spreading dawn, the great\r\nships manoeuvring smartly, each strove to obtain points of vantage, and\r\nvied with each other in their awful work of destruction. The activity of\r\nthe British torpedo boats, darting here and there, showed that those who\r\nmanned them were utterly reckless of their lives. As they sped about, it\r\nwas indeed marvellous how they escaped destruction, for the Russians had\r\nmore than double the number of boats, and their speed was quite equal to\r\nour own.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the British boats followed up their successes by other\r\nbrilliant deeds of daring, for one of them, with a sudden dash, took the\r\n_Rynda_ off her guard, and sent a torpedo at her with awful result,\r\nwhile a few moments later two terrific explosions sounded almost\r\nsimultaneously above the thunder of the guns, and it was then seen that\r\nthe unprotected cruiser _Asia_, and the last remaining transport the\r\n_Krasnaya Gorka_, were both sinking.\r\n\r\nIt was a ghastly spectacle.\r\n\r\nHoarse despairing shrieks went up from hundreds of Russian sailors who\r\nfought and struggled for life in the dark rolling waters, and three\r\nBritish torpedo boats humanely rescued a great number of them. Many,\r\nhowever, sank immediately with their vessels, while some strong swimmers\r\nstruck out for the distant shore. Yet, without exception, all these\r\nsuccumbed to exhaustion ere they could reach the land, and the long\r\nwaves closed over them as they threw up their arms and sank into the\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few minutes following this sudden disaster to the enemy\r\nthe firing ceased, and the _Navarin_ ran up signals. This action\r\nattracted the attention of the officers of the British vessels to the\r\napproaching ships, and to their amazement and dismay they discovered\r\nthat they were a squadron of the enemy who had returned unexpectedly\r\nfrom the direction of Dover.\r\n\r\nThe British ships, in their half-crippled condition, could not possibly\r\nwithstand such an onslaught as they knew was about to be made upon them,\r\nfor the enemy's reinforcements consisted of the steel barbette-ships\r\n_Gangut_, _Alexander II._, and _Nicolai I._, of the Baltic Fleet, the\r\ngreat turret-ship _Petr Veliky_, the _Rurik_, a very powerful\r\ncentral-battery belted cruiser of over ten thousand tons, two new\r\ncruisers of the same type that had been recently completed, the _Enara_\r\nand _Ischma_, with three other cruisers and a large flotilla of torpedo\r\nboats. Accompanying them were the French 10,000-ton armoured\r\nbarbette-ship _Magenta_, the central-battery ship _Richelieu_, the\r\narmoured turret-ship _Tonnerre_, and the _Hoche_, one of the finest\r\nvessels of our Gallic neighbour's Navy, as well as the torpedo cruisers\r\n_Hirondelle_ and _Fleurus_, and a number of swift torpedo boats and\r\n\"catchers.\"\r\n\r\nThe captains of the British vessels saw that in the face of such a force\r\ndefeat was a foregone conclusion; therefore they could do nothing but\r\nretreat hastily towards Newhaven, in the hope of finding the division of\r\nthe British Coastguard Squadron which had gone there for the same\r\npurpose as they had rounded Beachy Head, namely, to destroy the enemy's\r\ntransports.\r\n\r\nWithout delay the three vessels swung round with all speed and were\r\nquickly headed down Channel, while the remaining attendant torpedo\r\nboats, noticing this sudden retreat, also darted away. This manoeuvre\r\ndid not, of course, proceed unchecked, the enemy being determined they\r\nshould not escape. Signals were immediately made by the _Alexander II._,\r\nthe flagship, and the _Petr Veliky_ and _Enara_, being within range,\r\nblazed forth a storm of shell upon the fugitives. The shots, however,\r\nfell wide, and ricochetted over the water, sending up huge columns of\r\nspray; whereupon the _Narcissus_ and _Galatea_ replied steadily with\r\ntheir 6-inch guns, while the heavy guns of the _Hannibal_ were also\r\nquickly brought into play.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the _Magenta_ and _Tonnerre_ with the _Alger_,\r\n_Cecille_, and _Sfax_, started in pursuit, and an intensely exciting\r\nchase commenced. The engines of the British vessels were run at the\r\nhighest possible pressure, but the French ships proved several knots\r\nswifter. As they steamed at full speed around Beachy Head towards\r\nSeaford Bay the enemy gradually overhauled them. The brisk fire which\r\nwas being kept up soon began to tell, for all three retreating ships had\r\nlost many men, and the scenes of bloodshed on board were frightful.\r\n\r\nEagerly the officers swept the horizon with their glasses to discover\r\nsigns of friendly aid, but none hove in sight. All three ships were\r\nweak, their guns disabled, with whole guns' crews lying dead around, and\r\nmany of the officers had fallen. In strength, in speed, in armaments--in\r\nfact, in everything--they were inferior to their opponents, and they saw\r\nit was a question of sheer force, not one of courage.\r\n\r\nThey would either be compelled to surrender to the Tricolor, or\r\ndeliberately seek the grave. With such a force bearing down upon them,\r\nescape seemed absolutely impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OFF BEACHY HEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun at last broke forth brilliantly, betokoning another blazing day.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the fact that both the Channel Fleet and the reserve\r\nhad been sent on futile errands by our enemy's secret agent, and the\r\nsuperior forces against which the British had all along had to fight,\r\nthey had most assuredly shown what tact and courage could effect.\r\n\r\nOpposite the Belle Tout lighthouse a disaster occurred to the\r\n_Narcissus_. During the fight one of her engines had been injured, and\r\nthis being now strained to its utmost limit had suddenly broken down\r\naltogether, with the result that the vessel gradually slackened speed,\r\nand the _Sfax_ and _Alger_ bore down quickly upon her, pouring into her\r\na heavy fire from their 5-tonners. The reply was a weak one from her\r\nquick-firing guns, her heavy arms having nearly all been disabled.\r\n\r\nOnward steamed the _Galatea_ and _Hannibal_, keeping up a running fire\r\nwith the four vessels pursuing them, while the two cruisers engaging the\r\n_Narcissus_ continued their strenuous endeavours to silence her guns.\r\nThe British sailors, however, still undaunted, quickly showed their\r\nopponents that all the arms workable would be brought into play by\r\ndirecting a most vigorous fire upon their pursuers, blowing away one of\r\nthe funnels of the _Alger_, and disabling one of her large bow guns.\r\n\r\nJust then, however, while the _Narcissus_ was discharging a broadside, a\r\ntorpedo boat crept under her stern and sent forth its submerged\r\nprojectile. For a moment there was a hush of expectation, then a dull\r\nexplosion sounded as the cruiser, apparently rent in twain, plunged\r\nstern foremost into the sea, and with her ensign still flying gradually\r\ndisappeared without a soul on board being able to save himself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the _Galatea_ and _Hannibal_, with their torpedo boats, were\r\nsustaining serious injuries from the heavy bow fire, and there seemed\r\nevery possibility that they too would share the same terrible fate as\r\nthe _Narcissus_, when suddenly one of the officers of the _Galatea_\r\ndiscovered three vessels approaching. The \"demand\" was immediately\r\nhoisted, and responded to by both vessels running up private signals.\r\nWith an expression of satisfaction he directed the attention of the\r\ncaptain to the fact, for the flags of the first-named vessel showed her\r\nto be the British turret-ship _Monarch_, and those of the second the\r\ngreat barbette-ship _Rodney_, while a moment later it was discerned that\r\nthe third vessel was the _Gorgon_.\r\n\r\nEven as they looked, other masts appeared upon the horizon, and then\r\nthey knew relief was at hand. Both vessels ran up signals, while the\r\nmen, encouraged by the knowledge that some powerful British ironclads\r\nwere bearing down to their aid in indented line ahead, worked with\r\nincreased vigour to keep the enemy at bay.\r\n\r\nIt was a fierce, sanguinary fight. Fire vomited from all the vessels'\r\nbattered works, and the scuppers ran with blood. The French vessels,\r\nhaving apparently also noticed the relief approaching, did not seem\r\ninclined to fight, but were nevertheless compelled, and not for a single\r\ninstant did the firing from the attacked vessels cease. Their guns\r\nshowed constant bursts of flame.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, the _Rodney_ drew within range. A puff of white smoke\r\nfrom her barbette, and the _Cecille_ received a taste of her\r\nquick-firing guns, the shots from which struck her amidships, killing a\r\nlarge number of her men, and tearing up her deck. This was followed by\r\ndeafening discharges from the four 25-ton guns of the _Monarch_, while\r\nthe _Gorgon_ and a number of other vessels as they approached all took\r\npart in the conflict, the engagement quickly becoming general. With\r\ngreat precision the British directed their fire, and the French vessels\r\nsoon prepared to beat a retreat, when, without warning, a frightful\r\nexplosion occurred on board the _Hirondelle_, and wreckage mingled with\r\nhuman limbs shot into the air amid a great sheet of flame.\r\n\r\nThe magazine had exploded! The scene on board the doomed vessel, even as\r\nwitnessed from the British ships, was awful. Terrified men left their\r\nguns, and, rushing hither and thither, sought means of escape. But the\r\nboats had already been smashed by shots from the British cruisers, and\r\nall knew that death was inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe burning ship slowly foundered beneath them, and as they rushed about\r\nin despair they fell back into the roaring flames. A British torpedo\r\nboat rescued about a dozen; but presently, with a heavy list, the\r\nwarship suddenly swung round, and, bow first, disappeared into the green\r\nsunlit sea, leaving only a few poor wretches, who, after struggling\r\nvainly on the surface for a few moments, also went down to the unknown.\r\n\r\nThe carnage was frightful. Hundreds of men were being launched into\r\neternity, while upon the horizon both east and west dozens of ships of\r\nboth invaders and defenders were rapidly approaching, and all would, ere\r\nlong, try conclusions.\r\n\r\nBefore half an hour had passed, a fierce battle, as sanguinary as any in\r\nthe world's history, had commenced. The cruisers, acting as satellites\r\nto the battleships forming the two opposing fighting lines, had quickly\r\ncommenced a series of fierce skirmishes and duels, all the most\r\ndestructive engines of modern warfare being brought into play.\r\n\r\nThe division of our Channel Fleet that had at last returned consisted of\r\nthe powerful battleship _Royal Sovereign_, flying the Admiral's flag;\r\nthe barbette-ships _Anson_, _Howe_, _Camperdown_, and _Benbow_; the\r\nturret-ships _Thunderer_ and _Conqueror_; the cruisers _Mersey_,\r\n_Terpsichore_, _Melampus_, _Tribune_, _Latona_, _Immortalite_, and\r\n_Barham_; with the torpedo gunboats _Spanker_ and _Speedwell_, and\r\nnineteen torpedo boats.\r\n\r\nThe forces of the invaders were more than double that of the British,\r\nfor, in addition to the vessels already enumerated, the reinforcements\r\nconsisted of the French battleships _Amiral Baudin_, _Formidable_,\r\n_Amiral Duperre_, _Brennus_, _Trehouart_, _Jemappes_, _Terrible_,\r\n_Requin_, _Indomptable_, _Caiman_, _Courbet_, _Devastation_,\r\n_Redoubtable_, and _Furieux_, together with nine cruisers, and\r\nthirty-eight _torpilleurs de haute mer_.\r\n\r\nFrom the very commencement the fighting was at close quarters, and the\r\nstorm of shot and shell caused death on every hand. With such an\r\noverwhelming force at his disposal, Admiral Maigret, the French\r\ncommander, had been enabled to take up a position which boded ill for\r\nthe defenders, nevertheless the British Admiral on board the _Royal\r\nSovereign_ was determined to exert every effort to repulse the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the thick of the fight the great flagship steamed along, her\r\ncompartments closed, her stokeholds screwed down, her four 67-ton guns\r\nhurling great shots from her barbettes, and her smaller arms pouring out\r\na continuous deadly fire upon the French ship _Indomptable_ on the one\r\nside, and the great Russian armoured cruiser _Nicolai I._ on the other.\r\nUpon the latter the British vessel's shells played with a terribly\r\ndevastating effect, bringing down the large forward mast and the machine\r\nguns in her fighting tops, and then, while the crew worked to get the\r\nwreckage clear, the Maxim, Nordenfelt, and Hotchkiss guns of the _Royal\r\nSovereign_ suddenly rattled out, sweeping with their metal hail her\r\nopponent's deck, and mowing down those who were cutting adrift the\r\nfallen rigging. A moment later a shell struck one of the pair of guns in\r\nthe _Nicolai's_ turret, rendering it useless, and then the captain of\r\nthe _Royal Sovereign_, who had been standing in the conning-tower calmly\r\nawaiting his chance, touched three electric knobs in rapid succession.\r\nThe engines throbbed, the great ship moved along at increasing speed\r\nthrough dense clouds of stifling smoke, and as she did so the captain\r\nshouted an order which had the effect of suddenly turning the vessel,\r\nand while her great barbette guns roared, the ram of the British vessel\r\ncrashed into the broadside of the Tsar's ship with a terrific impact\r\nwhich caused her to shiver from stem to stern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_Nicolai I._    _Royal Sovereign._\r\nBATTLE OFF BEACHY HEAD: H.M.S. \"ROYAL SOVEREIGN\" RAMMING THE\r\n\"NICOLAI I.\"]\r\n\r\nThen, as the big guns in her rear barbette thundered out upon the\r\n_Indomptable_, whose engines had broken down, she drew gradually back\r\nfrom the terrible breach her ram had made under the water-line of her\r\nopponent, and the latter at once commenced to sink. The force of the\r\nimpact had been so great that the Russian's hull was absolutely broken\r\nin two, and as the iron stretched and rent like paper, she heaved slowly\r\nover, \"turning turtle,\" and carrying down with her over three hundred\r\nofficers and men.\r\n\r\nThe British captain now turned his attention to the French ship, which\r\nhad been joined in the attack by the _Brennus_, the fire from whose\r\n58-ton guns at close quarters played great havoc with the British\r\nflagship's superstructure. A second later, however, the captain of the\r\n_Royal Sovereign_ caught the _Indomptable_ in an unguarded moment, and,\r\nspringing towards one of the electric knobs before him, pressed it. This\r\nhad the effect of ejecting a torpedo from one of the bow tubes, and so\r\nwell directed was it that a few seconds later there was a deafening\r\nreport, as part of the stern portion of the French ship was blown away,\r\nraising great columns of spray.\r\n\r\nThe situation was awful, and the loss of life everywhere enormous.\r\nDense, blinding smoke, and the choking fumes of melinite, obscured the\r\nsun, and in the darkness thus caused the flames from the guns shed a\r\nlurid light upon decks strewn with dead and dying. The cruisers and\r\nscouts by which our battleships were surrounded cut off many of the\r\nFrench torpedo boats, but a large number got right in among the fleet,\r\nand some terrible disasters were thus caused. Once inside the circle of\r\nBritish cruisers, all fire directed at the boats was as dangerous to our\r\nown ships as to the enemy's boats.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the French torpedo boats was, alas! keenly felt by\r\nthe British, for in the course of the first hour five of our\r\ncruisers--the _Terpsichore_, _Galatea_, _Melampus_, _Tribune_, _Mersey_,\r\nthe turret-ship _Conqueror_, and the battleships _Hannibal_ and\r\n_Rodney_, had been blown up. As compared with these losses, those of the\r\nenemy were at this stage by no means small. The French had lost two\r\ncruisers and four torpedo boats, and the Russians one battleship, three\r\ncruisers, and six torpedo boats.\r\n\r\nThe British, with all these fearful odds against them, still continued a\r\ngalling fire. The _Camperdown_, _Anson_, and _Benbow_, steaming together\r\nin line, belched a storm of shell from their barbettes, which caused\r\nwholesale destruction among the crowd of ships engaging them. Yet the\r\nwithering fire of the enemy was telling terribly upon the comparatively\r\nsmall force of the defenders. Upon all three battleships the casualties\r\nwere frightful, and on board each one or more of the heavy guns had been\r\ndisabled. Suddenly a shot, penetrating a weak point in the armour of the\r\n_Anson_, entered her engine-room, disabling a portion of her machinery,\r\nwhile a moment later a shell from the _Amiral Duperre_ fell close to her\r\nbroadside torpedo discharge, and a fragment of the shell coming into\r\ncontact with the striker of a torpedo, just as it was about to leave its\r\ntube, caused a terrific and disastrous explosion between the decks. The\r\neffect was horrifying. The torpedo contained over 70 lb. of gun-cotton,\r\ntherefore the devastating nature of the explosion may be readily\r\nimagined. Over a hundred men were blown to atoms, and the whole six of\r\nthe broadside guns were more or less disabled.\r\n\r\nA second later, however, a shell from the _Benbow_ struck the _Amiral\r\nDuperre_, carrying away the greater portion of her conning-tower, and\r\nkilling her captain instantly, while almost at the same moment a torpedo\r\nfrom one of the British boats struck her bows with a frightful\r\ndetonation, blowing an enormous hole in them. The catastrophe was\r\ncomplete. The crew of the doomed ship, panic-stricken, left their guns\r\nand commenced to launch the only two boats that remained uninjured; but\r\nere this could be accomplished, the _Trehouart_, which suddenly went\r\nastern, apparently to avoid a torpedo, crashed into her, with the\r\nresult that she heeled right over and quickly disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe _Camperdown_, fighting fiercely with the _Requin_, the _Terrible_,\r\nand the _Courbet_, was suffering terrible damage from bow to stern;\r\nnevertheless her guns kept up an incessant torrent of shot, until\r\nsuddenly, just after one of her shells had struck right under the turret\r\nof the _Terrible_, there was a deafening report, the air was filled with\r\ndense smoke, and the French ship, with her engines disabled, commenced\r\nto fill and sink.\r\n\r\nA portion of the shell had penetrated to her magazine, and she had blown\r\nup, nearly half her crew being killed by the terrific force of the\r\nexplosion. Many of the remaining men, however, scrambled on board the\r\n_Caiman_, which by some means had come into slight collision with her;\r\nbut scarcely had the last terrified man left the sinking vessel, when\r\nthe _Camperdown's_ powerful ram entered the _Caiman's_ bows, breaking\r\nher hull, and she also foundered, carrying down with her not only her\r\nown crew, but also the survivors of the _Terrible_.\r\n\r\nThis success was witnessed with satisfaction by the British Admiral, who\r\nnevertheless saw how seriously weakened was his force, and how critical\r\nwas the position of his few remaining ships. Yet he remained quite cool,\r\nfor the heavy guns of the steel monster in whose conning-tower he stood\r\ncontinued thundering forth their projectiles, and the White Ensign still\r\nloomed defiantly through the dense black smoke, fluttering in the\r\nfreshening breeze that was now springing up.\r\n\r\nAlthough a number of the enemy's vessels had been sunk, he knew the\r\nissue must be fatal to his force, for they were now surrounded by a\r\nnumber of ships so vastly superior to them in armament and speed, that\r\nto die fighting was their only course.\r\n\r\nThough the cockpits were full, true British indomitable courage was\r\nshowing itself everywhere on board our ships. Officers by words of\r\nencouragement incited their men to splendid heroic deeds, and guns'\r\ncrews, with dark determined faces, seeing only death ahead, resolved to\r\nfight and struggle to the last for the honour of the Union Jack, which\r\nshould never be surmounted by the Tricolor.\r\n\r\nA moment later, the captain, standing with the Admiral, who had just\r\nentered the conning-tower of the _Royal Sovereign_, suddenly uttered a\r\ncry of dismay, and with transfixed, horrified gaze pointed with his\r\nfinger to the sea.\r\n\r\nBreathlessly the Admiral looked in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\nThough one of the bravest men in the Navy, and on his breast he wore the\r\nVictoria Cross, his eyes fell upon a sight that appalled him.\r\n\r\nIt was a critical moment.\r\n\r\nA small French vessel, the unarmoured cruiser _Faucon_, had crept up\r\nunnoticed. The attention of the British officers had been, until that\r\nmoment, concentrated upon the three powerful battleships, the _Requin_,\r\nthe _Devastation_, and the _Jemappes_, which kept up their hot fire upon\r\nthe flagship, causing terrible destruction. Now, however, the British\r\nAdmiral saw himself surrounded by the enemy, and the sight which caused\r\nhis heart to beat quickly was a distinct line of bubbles upon the water,\r\nadvancing with terrific speed, showing that a torpedo had been ejected\r\nfrom the _Faucon_ directly at his ship!\r\n\r\nIn the conning-tower all knew their danger, but not a man spoke. Both\r\nthe Admiral and the captain at the same instant saw the death-dealing\r\nprojectile advancing, and both retained their coolness and presence of\r\nmind. The captain, shouting an order, sprang back and touched one of the\r\nelectric signals, which was instantly responded to.\r\n\r\nIt was the work of a second. The great engines roared and throbbed, and\r\nthe huge vessel, propelled backwards by its 13,000 horse-power, swung\r\nsteadily round just as the torpedo glanced off her bow obliquely. The\r\ncrew of the _Royal Sovereign_ had never been nearer death than at that\r\ninstant. Had the ironclad not halted in her course, the striker of the\r\ntorpedo would have come square upon her bows, and one of the finest\r\nvessels of the British Navy would have probably gone to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe _Faucon_ was not given an opportunity to make a second attempt. The\r\ncaptain of the _Anson_ had witnessed how narrowly the British flagship\r\nhad escaped, and immediately turned his great guns upon the little\r\nvessel, with the result that her quick-firing guns were quickly rendered\r\nuseless, her hull was torn up like paper, and she slowly sank without\r\noffering resistance.\r\n\r\nShots came from the frowning barbettes of the _Camperdown_, _Benbow_,\r\nand the turrets of the _Monarch_ rapidly, the damage and loss of life\r\nsuffered by the enemy now being enormous. The three French battleships\r\nengaging the _Royal Sovereign_ at close quarters received terrible\r\npunishment. One of the 75-ton guns of the _Requin_ had been rendered\r\nuseless, her deck had been torn up, and her bulwarks had been carried\r\naway, together with her funnel and forward mast. The rear barbette gun\r\nof the _Jemappes_ had been thrown off its mounting, and a shell striking\r\nthe port side battery, had burst against the forward bulkhead, and\r\nwrought horrible destruction among the guns' crews.\r\n\r\nThe three powerful French vessels pouring their fire upon the British\r\nflagship, and finding themselves being raked by the heavy fire of their\r\nadversary, signalled the _Tonnerre_ and _Furieux_ to assist them. Both\r\nvessels drew nearer, and soon afterwards commenced pounding at the\r\n_Royal Sovereign_.\r\n\r\nThe _Anson_, however, noticed the dangerous position of the British\r\nflagship, and, having manoeuvred adroitly, succeeded in getting under\r\nway, and with her great forward guns thundering, she crashed her ram\r\ninto the _Furieux_, and sank her, while almost at the same moment a\r\ntorpedo, discharged from one of the British boats, struck the _Tonnerre_\r\nright amidships, dealing her a blow from which she could never recover.\r\nFive minutes later, the _Gangut_, fighting desperately at close quarters\r\nwith the _Camperdown_, had part of her armoured casemate blown away, and\r\nthe British battleship followed up this success by directing a torpedo\r\nat her in such a manner that, although she drew back quickly to avoid\r\nit, she nevertheless received it right under her stern. Some ammunition\r\non board that vessel also exploded, and the effect was frightful, for\r\nfragments of wood, iron, and human bodies were precipitated in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThe loss of life, although heavy on the British side, was nevertheless\r\nfar greater on board the enemy's ships. The continuity and precision of\r\nthe British fire wrought awful destruction. Between the decks of many of\r\nthe French and Russian ships the carnage was frightful. Among wrecked\r\nguns and mountings lay headless and armless bodies; human limbs\r\nshattered by shells were strewn in all directions upon decks slippery\r\nwith blood. The shrieks of the dying were drowned by the roar and crash\r\nof the guns, the deafening explosion of shells, and the rending of iron\r\nand steel as the projectiles pierced armourplates, destroying everything\r\nwith which they came in contact.\r\n\r\nThe noon had passed, and as the day wore on other catastrophes occurred\r\ninvolving further loss of life. One of these was the accidental ramming\r\nof the _Sfax_ by the French battleship _Redoubtable_, which managed,\r\nhowever, to save the greater portion of the crew, although her engines\r\nbroke down.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon the fire from the British ships seemed to increase\r\nrather than diminish, notwithstanding each vessel flying the White\r\nEnsign fought more than one of the enemy's ships, and in doing so\r\nconstantly received shots that spread death and destruction between the\r\ndecks. Still, amid the blinding smoke, the din of battle, and the\r\nconstant roaring of the guns, British bluejackets with smoke-begrimed\r\nfaces worked enthusiastically for the defence of Old England. Many\r\nheroic deeds were performed that memorable afternoon, and many a gallant\r\nhero was sent to an untimely grave.\r\n\r\nOn board the _Royal Sovereign_ the destruction was frightful. By four\r\no'clock many of the guns had been disabled, half the crew had perished,\r\nand the decks ran with the life-blood of Britain's gallant defenders.\r\nThe captain had been struck upon the forehead by a flying fragment of\r\nshell, causing a fearful wound; yet, with his head enveloped in a\r\nhastily improvised bandage, he stuck to his post. He was engaging the\r\n_Redoubtable_ and getting the worst of it, when suddenly, having\r\nmanoeuvred once or twice, he turned to his lieutenant, saying, \"Lay\r\nguns, ahead full speed, and prepare to ram.\" The officer addressed\r\ntransmitted the order, and a few moments later, as her guns thundered\r\nforth, the bows of the _Royal Sovereign_ entered the broadside of the\r\nFrench ship with a loud crash, ripping her almost in half.\r\n\r\nBacking again quickly as the _Redoubtable_ sank, she suddenly received a\r\nshock which made her reel and shiver. A shell from the Russian flagship\r\nhad struck under her stern barbette, but, failing to penetrate the\r\narmour, glanced off into the sea.\r\n\r\nFiercer and more fierce became the fight. A well-directed shot from one\r\nof the 67-ton guns on the _Anson's_ rear barbette struck the\r\nconning-tower of the _Magenta_, blowing it away, killing the captain and\r\nthose who were directing the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe sun was sinking, but the battle still raged with unabated fury. Each\r\nside struggled desperately for the mastery. The British, fighting nobly\r\nagainst what had all along been overwhelming odds, had succeeded in\r\nsinking some of the enemy's finest ships, and inflicting terrible loss\r\nupon the crews of the others; yet the British Admiral, on viewing the\r\nsituation, was compelled to admit that he was outnumbered, and that a\r\ncontinuance of the struggle would inevitably result in the loss of other\r\nof his ships. There still remained three of the enemy's vessels to each\r\none of the British. His ships were all more or less crippled, therefore\r\na successful stand against the still overwhelming force would be sheer\r\nmadness. He was not the sort of man to show the white feather;\r\nnevertheless a retreat upon Portsmouth had now become a matter of\r\npolicy, and the _Royal Sovereign_ a few minutes later ran up signals\r\nintimating to the other vessels her intention.\r\n\r\nAs the British Squadron moved away down Channel the hoarse exultant\r\nshouts of the enemy filled the air. But the fighting became even more\r\ndesperate, and for over an hour there was a most exciting chase. The\r\nrunning fire did little harm to the retreating ships, but their stern\r\nguns played terrible havoc with the French and Russian torpedo boats,\r\nwhich were picked off one after another with remarkable rapidity.\r\n\r\nOff Littlehampton one of the Russian ships ran up signals, and\r\nimmediately the enemy's ships slackened. Apparently they had no desire\r\nto follow further west, for after a few parting shots they turned and\r\nstood away up Channel again, while the surviving ships of the British\r\nSquadron steamed onward in the blood-red track of the dying day.\r\n\r\nAt their head was the _Royal Sovereign_, battered, and bearing marks of\r\nthe deadly strife; but bright against the clear, calm evening sky, the\r\nBritish flag, half of which had been shot away, still fluttered out in\r\nthe cool breeze of sunset.\r\n\r\nThe British Lion had shown his teeth. Alas, that our Navy should have\r\nbeen so weak! Several of the ships had had their engines severely\r\ndamaged or broken, but our margin of additional strength was so small\r\nthat we had no vessels wherewith to replace those compelled to return to\r\nport.\r\n\r\nThe struggle in this, the first naval battle in the defence of our\r\nEmpire, had been desperate, and the loss of life appalling.\r\n\r\nThe First Act of the most sanguinary drama of modern nations had closed.\r\n\r\nWhat would be its _denouement_?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK II_\r\n\r\n_THE STRUGGLE_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE DOOM OF HULL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Hull forty-eight long weary hours of anxious suspense and breathless\r\nexcitement had passed. The night was dark, the sky overcast, and there\r\nwas in the air that oppressive sultry stillness precursory of a storm.\r\n\r\nChurch clocks had chimed ten, yet most of the shops were still open, and\r\nthe well-lighted streets of the drab old Yorkshire town were filled by a\r\npale-faced, terror-stricken crowd surging down the thoroughfares towards\r\nthe Victoria Pier. A panic had suddenly been created an hour before by\r\nthe issue of an extra-special edition of the Hull evening paper, the\r\n_Daily News_, containing a brief telegram in large type, as follows:--\r\n\r\n    The Coastguard at Donna Nook report that a strong force of\r\n    Russian war vessels, including the turret-ship _Sevastopol_ and\r\n    the barbette-ships _Sinope_ and _Cizoi Veliky_, have just hove\r\n    in sight and are making for the Humber. Lloyd's signal station\r\n    on Spurn Point has also intimated that hostile ships coming from\r\n    the south are lying-to just beyond the Lightship.\r\n\r\nThe papers sold more quickly than they could be printed, a shilling each\r\nbeing given for copies by the excited townspeople, who now, for the\r\nfirst time, suddenly realised that the enemy was upon them. Men and boys\r\nwith bundles of limp papers, damp from the press, rushed along\r\nWhitefriargate, away in every direction into the suburbs, shouting the\r\nappalling intelligence in hoarse, strident tones that awoke the echoes\r\nof the quieter thoroughfares.\r\n\r\nNow, even as purchasers of papers read the few lines of print under the\r\ndim uncertain light of street lamps, the dull booming of distant guns\r\nfell upon their ears, and the populace, wildly excited, made their way\r\nwith one accord towards the Victoria Pier, to glean the latest news, and\r\nascertain the true significance of the repeated firing.\r\n\r\nWas Hull in danger? Would the enemy advance up the river and bombard the\r\ntown? These all-important questions were on every one's tongue, and as\r\nthe thousands of all classes rushed hither and thither, wild rumours of\r\nthe enemy's intentions spread and increased the horror.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour of the publication of the first intimation of the\r\npresence of the invaders the excitement had become intense, and the\r\nnarrow streets and narrower bridges had become congested by a\r\nterror-stricken multitude. Time after time the thunder of heavy guns\r\nshook the town, causing windows to clatter, and the people standing on\r\nthe pier and along the riverside strained their eyes into the cavernous\r\ndarkness towards the sea. But they could discern nothing. Across at New\r\nHolland, two miles away, lamps twinkled, but the many lights--red,\r\nwhite, and green--that stud the broad river for the guidance of the\r\nmariner had, since the Declaration of War, been extinguished. The\r\nfamiliar distant lights that had never failed to shine seaward at Salt\r\nEnd and Thorngumbald no longer shed their radiance, and from the\r\nrevolving lights at Spurn no stream of brilliancy now flashed away upon\r\nthe rolling waters of the North Sea. The buoys had been cut adrift, the\r\nBull Lightship taken from her moorings, and the entrance to Grimsby\r\nharbour was unillumined. Not a star appeared in the sky, for all was\r\ndark, black, and threatening. Through the hot, heavy atmosphere the roar\r\nof cannon came from the direction of Spurn Point, and as the sounds of\r\nthe shots fell upon the ears of the anxious watchers, they stood aghast,\r\nwondering what would be their destiny.\r\n\r\nThe suspense was awful. Men, women, and children, with scared faces,\r\nstood in groups in the market-place, in Queen Street, and in High\r\nStreet, discussing the situation. This question, however, was already\r\nengaging the attention of the municipal and military authorities, for on\r\nhearing the alarming news the Mayor, with shrewd promptitude, walked\r\nquickly to the Town Hall, and held a hurried informal consultation with\r\nMr. Charles Wilson, Mr. Arthur Wilson, Mr. Richardson, Major Wellsted,\r\nAlderman Woodhouse, and a number of aldermen and councillors. All knew\r\nthe town was in peril. The enemy could have but one object in entering\r\nthe Humber. Yet it was agreed that no steps could be taken at such brief\r\nnotice to defend the place. The guardship _Edinburgh_ had been withdrawn\r\nto form part of the squadron upon which they would be compelled to rely,\r\nwith the batteries at Paull and the submarine mines.\r\n\r\nIt was evident by the firing that an attack upon the British Squadron\r\nhad commenced. The shadow of impending disaster had fallen.\r\n\r\nWorking men, hurrying towards the pier, stopped their leader, Mr.\r\nMillington, and tried to learn what was being done, while many of the\r\nleading townsfolk were thronged around for information, and were centres\r\nof excited groups in Whitefriargate. The boatmen, sharply questioned on\r\nevery hand, were as ignorant of the state of affairs as those seeking\r\ninformation, so nothing could be done except to wait.\r\n\r\nWomen and children of the middle and upper classes, regardless of their\r\ndestination, were being hurried away by anxious fathers. Every train\r\nleaving Hull was filled to overflowing by those fleeing from the advance\r\nof the Russians, and on the roads inland to Beverley, Selby, and Market\r\nWeighton crowds of every class hurried away to seek some place of\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, just before eleven o'clock, the thousands anxiously peering\r\nover the wide, dark waters saw away on the bank, three miles distant,\r\ntwo beams of white light, which slowly swept both reaches of the river.\r\n\r\nThey were the search-lights of the battery at Paull. Scarcely had the\r\nbright streaks shone out and disappeared when they were followed by a\r\nterrific cannonade from the forts, and then, for the first time, those\r\nstanding on the Victoria Pier could discern the enemy's ships. How many\r\nthere were it was impossible at that moment to tell, but instantly their\r\nguns flashed and thundered at the forts in reply. Far away seaward could\r\nalso be heard low booming. The enemy's vessels were creeping carefully\r\nup the Humber, being compelled to take constant soundings on account of\r\nthe removal of the buoys, and evidently guided by foreign pilots who had\r\nfor years been permitted to take vessels up and down the river.\r\n\r\nMoments dragged on like hours, each bringing the town of Hull nearer its\r\nfate. The people knew it, but were powerless. They stood awaiting the\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThe Russian force, besides the three vessels already mentioned, included\r\nthe armoured cruiser _Dimitri Donskoi_, the central-battery ship _Kniaz\r\nPojarski_, the cruiser _Pamyat Merkuriya_, two of the new armoured\r\ncruisers, _Mezen_ and _Syzran_, of the _Rurik_ type, the corvette\r\n_Razboynik_, the torpedo gunboats _Griden_ and _Gaidamak_, and the\r\narmoured gunboat _Gremyastchy_, with several torpedo boats.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which they had manoeuvred to pass Spurn Point and ascend\r\nthe river was remarkable, and astounded the officers in the forts at\r\nPaull. They, however, were not aware that each captain of those vessels\r\npossessed a copy of the British secret code and other important\r\ninformation compiled from the documents filched from the body of the\r\nAdmiralty messenger by the Count von Beilstein at the Mariners' Rest at\r\nDeal!\r\n\r\nThe possession of this secret knowledge, which was, of course, unknown\r\nto our Admiralty, enabled the captains of the Russian vessels to evade\r\nsunken hulks and other obstructions, and take some of their ships slowly\r\nup the river, bearing well on the Lincolnshire coast, so as to keep,\r\nuntil the last moment, out of the range of the search-lights at Paull.\r\nThen, on the first attack from the batteries, they suddenly replied\r\nwith such a hail of shell, that from the first moment it was clear that\r\nthe strength of the fort with its obsolete guns was totally inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe roar of the cannonade was incessant. Amid the deafening explosions\r\nthe townspeople of Hull rushed up and down the streets screaming and\r\nterrified. Suddenly a great shell fell with a dull thud in Citadel\r\nStreet, close to a crowd of excited women, and exploding a second later,\r\nblew a number of them to atoms, and wrecked the fronts of several\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nThis served to increase the panic. The people were on the verge of\r\nmadness with fright and despair. Thousands seized their money and\r\njewellery and fled away upon the roads leading to the country. Others\r\nhid away their valuables, and preferred to remain; the crisis had come,\r\nand as Britons they determined to face it.\r\n\r\nWhile the Russian ships, lying broadside-on in positions carefully\r\nselected to avoid the electro-contact mines, poured their terrible fire\r\nupon the land battery at Paull, their torpedo boats darted hither and\r\nthither with extraordinary rapidity. Several were sunk by shots from the\r\nbattery, but four piquet boats in the darkness at last managed to creep\r\nup, and after searching, seized the cable connecting the mines with the\r\nSubmarine Mining Station at Paull.\r\n\r\nThis was discovered just at the critical moment by means of one of the\r\nBritish search-lights, and upon the hostile boats a frightful cascade of\r\nprojectiles was poured by the quick-firing guns of the battery.\r\n\r\nBut it was, alas, too late! The cable had been cut. To the whole of the\r\nwires a small electric battery had in a moment been attached, and as the\r\nguns of the fort crashed out there were a series of dull explosions\r\nunder the bed of the river across the channel from Foul Holme Sand to\r\nKillingholme Haven, and from Paull Coastguard Station to the Skitter.\r\n\r\nThe dark water rose here and there. The whole of the mines had been\r\nsimultaneously fired!\r\n\r\nCheers rang out from the Russian vessels, sounding above the heavy\r\ncannonade. The destruction of this most important portion of the\r\ndefences of the Humber had been accomplished by the boats just at the\r\nvery instant when they were shattered by British shells, and ere the\r\nwaters grew calm again the last vestige of the boats had disappeared.\r\nThe officers at Paull worked on with undaunted courage, striving by\r\nevery means in their power to combat with the superior forces. In a\r\nmeasure, too, they were successful, for such havoc did the shells play\r\nwith the gunboat _Gremyastchy_ that she slowly foundered, and her crew\r\nwere compelled to abandon her. A portion of the men were rescued by the\r\n_Syzran_, but two boatloads were precipitated into the water, and nearly\r\nall were drowned. Two of the big guns of the _Dimitri Donskoi_ were\r\ndisabled, and the loss of life on several of the ships was considerable.\r\nNevertheless the firing was still incessant. Time after time the 9-ton\r\nguns of the _Kniaz Pojarski_ and the four 131/2-tonners of the _Mezen_\r\nthrew their terrible missiles upon the defences at Paull with frightful\r\neffect, until at length, after a most desperate, stubborn resistance on\r\nthe part of the British commander of the battery, and after half the\r\ndefending force had been killed, the guns suddenly ceased.\r\n\r\nBoth land and sea defences had been broken down! The Russians were now\r\nfree to advance upon Hull!\r\n\r\nNot a moment was lost. Ten minutes after the guns of Paull had been\r\nsilenced, the enemy's ships, moving very cautiously forward, opened a\r\nwithering fire upon the town.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of that bombardment were frightful. At the moment of the\r\nfirst shots, fired almost simultaneously from the two big guns of the\r\n_Syzran_, the panic became indescribable. Both shells burst with loud\r\ndetonations and frightfully devastating effect. The first, striking one\r\nof the domes of the Dock Office, carried it bodily away, at the same\r\ntime killing several persons; while the other, crashing upon the\r\nExchange, unroofed it, and blew away the colossal statue of Britannia\r\nwhich surmounted the parapet on the corner. Surely this was an omen of\r\nimpending disaster!\r\n\r\nEre the horrified inhabitants could again draw breath, the air was rent\r\nby a terrific crash, as simultaneously flame rushed from the guns of\r\nthe _Kniaz Pojarski_, the _Pamyat Merkuriya_, and the _Mezen_, and great\r\nshells were hurled into the town in every direction. The place trembled\r\nand shook as if struck by an earthquake, and everywhere walls fell and\r\nbuildings collapsed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF HULL AND THE HUMBER.]\r\n\r\nLong bright beams of the search-lights swept the town and neighbouring\r\ncountry, lighting up the turbulent streets like day, and as the crowds\r\nrushed headlong from the river, shot and shell struck in their midst,\r\nkilling hundreds of starving toilers and unoffending men, women, and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nLying off Salt End, the _Cizoi Veliky_, which had now come up the river\r\nin company with two torpedo boats, poured from her barbette a heavy fire\r\nupon the Alexandra Dock and Earle's shipbuilding yard, while the other\r\nvessels, approaching nearer, wrought terrible destruction with every\r\nshot in various other parts of the town. In the course of a quarter of\r\nan hour many streets were impassable, owing to the fallen buildings, and\r\nin dozens of places the explosion of the melinite shells had set on fire\r\nthe ruined houses.\r\n\r\nMissiles hurled from such close quarters by such heavy guns wrought the\r\nmost fearful havoc. Naturally, the Russian gunners, discovering the most\r\nprominent buildings with their search-lights, aimed at them and\r\ndestroyed many of the public edifices.\r\n\r\nAmong the first prominent structures to topple and fall was the\r\nWilberforce Monument, and then, in rapid succession, shots carried away\r\nanother dome of the Dock Office, and the great square towers of St.\r\nJohn's and Holy Trinity Churches. The gaudily gilded equestrian statue\r\nof King William III. was flung from its pedestal and smashed by a heavy\r\nshot, which entered a shop opposite, completely wrecking it; and two\r\nshells, striking the handsome offices of the Hull Banking Company at the\r\ncorner of Silver Street, reduced the building to a heap of ruins. Deadly\r\nshells fell in quick succession in Paragon Street, and at the\r\nNorth-Eastern Railway Station, where the lines and platforms were torn\r\nup, and the Station Hotel, being set on fire, was soon burning fiercely,\r\nfor the flames spread unchecked here, as in every other quarter. Church\r\nspires fell crashing into neighbouring houses, whole rows of shops were\r\ndemolished in Whitefriargate, High Street, and Saville Street, and roads\r\nwere everywhere torn up by the enemy's exploding missiles.\r\n\r\nNot for a moment was there a pause in this awful work of destruction;\r\nnot for a moment was the frightful massacre of the inhabitants\r\nsuspended. The enemy's sole object was apparently to weaken the northern\r\ndefences of London by drawing back the Volunteer battalions to the\r\nnorth. There was no reason to bombard after the fort had been silenced,\r\nyet they had decided to destroy the town and cause the most widespread\r\ndesolation possible.\r\n\r\nFlame flashed from the muzzles of those great desolating guns so quickly\r\nas to appear like one brilliant, incessant light. Shells from the _Cizoi\r\nVeliky_ fell into the warehouses around the Alexandra Dock, and these,\r\nwith the fine new grain warehouses on each side of the river Hull, were\r\nblazing furiously with a terrible roar. High into the air great tongues\r\nof flame leaped, their volume increased by the crowd of ships in the\r\ndock also igniting in rapid succession, shedding a lurid glare over the\r\nterrible scene, and lighting up the red, angry sky. The long range of\r\nwarehouses, filled with inflammable goods, at the edge of the Albert and\r\nWilliam Wright Docks, were on fire, while the warehouses of the Railway\r\nDock, together with a large number of Messrs. Thomas Wilson's fine\r\nsteamers, were also in flames. Such a hold had the flames obtained that\r\nno power could arrest them, and as the glare increased it was seen by\r\nthose flying for their lives that the whole of the port was now\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nThe great petroleum stores of the Anglo-American Company, struck by a\r\nshell, exploded a few moments later with a most terrific and frightful\r\ndetonation which shook the town. For a moment it seemed as if both town\r\nand river were enveloped in one great sheet of flame, then, as blazing\r\noil ran down the gutters on every side, fierce fires showed, and whole\r\nstreets were alight from end to end.\r\n\r\nHundreds of persons perished in the flames, hundreds were shot down by\r\nthe fragments of flying missiles, and hundreds more were buried under\r\nfalling ruins. Everywhere the roar of flames mingled with the shrieks of\r\nthe dying. Shells striking the Royal Infirmary burst in the wards,\r\nkilling many patients in their beds, and setting fire to the building,\r\nwhile others, crashing through the roof of the Theatre Royal, carried\r\naway one of the walls and caused the place to ignite. One shot from the\r\n13-ton gun of the _Syzran_ tore its way into the nave of Holy Trinity\r\nChurch, and, exploding, blew out the three beautiful windows and wrecked\r\nthe interior, while another from the same gun demolished one of the\r\ncorner buildings of the new Market Hall. The handsome tower of the Town\r\nHall, struck by a shell just under the dial, came down with a frightful\r\ncrash, completely blocking Lowgate with its debris, and almost at the\r\nsame instant a shot came through the dome of the Council Chamber,\r\ntotally destroying the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe Mariners' Hospital and Trinity House suffered terribly, many of the\r\ninmates of the former being blown to pieces. One shot completely\r\ndemolished the Savings Bank at the corner of George Street, and a shell\r\nexploding under the portico of the Great Thornton Street Chapel blew out\r\nthe whole of its dark facade. Another, striking the extensive premises\r\nof a firm of lead merchants at the corner of Brook and Paragon Streets,\r\nswept away the range of buildings like grass before the scythe.\r\n\r\nIn the Queen's, Humber, Victoria, and Prince's Docks the congested crowd\r\nof idle merchant ships were enveloped in flames that wrapped themselves\r\nabout the rigging, and, crackling, leaped skyward. The Orphanage at\r\nSpring Bank, the Artillery Barracks, and Wilberforce House were all\r\nburning; in fact, in the course of the two hours during which the\r\nbombardment lasted hardly a building of note escaped.\r\n\r\nThe houses of the wealthy residents far away up Spring Bank, Anlaby and\r\nBeverley Roads, and around Pearson's Park, had been shattered and\r\ndemolished; the shops in Saville Street had without exception been\r\ndestroyed, and both the Cannon Street and Pier Stations had been\r\ncompletely wrecked and unroofed.\r\n\r\nSoon after two o'clock in the morning, when the Russian war vessels\r\nceased their thunder, the whole town was as one huge furnace, the\r\nintense heat and suffocating smoke from which caused the Russian Admiral\r\nto move his vessels towards the sea as quickly as the necessary\r\nsoundings allowed.\r\n\r\nThe glare lit the sky for many miles around. The immense area of great\r\nburning buildings presented a magnificent, appalling spectacle.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible national disaster--a frightful holocaust, in which\r\nthousands of lives, with property worth millions, had been wantonly\r\ndestroyed by a ruthless enemy which Britain's defective and obsolete\r\ndefences were too weak to keep at bay--a devastating catastrophe, swift,\r\ncomplete, awful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTERROR ON THE TYNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland was thrilled, dismayed, petrified. The wholesale massacre at\r\nEastbourne and the terrible details of the bombardment of Hull had\r\nspread increased horror everywhere throughout the land.\r\n\r\nTerror reigned on the Tyneside. Hospitals, asylums, and public\r\ninstitutions, crowded with affrighted inmates, had no food to\r\ndistribute. In Newcastle, in Shields, in Jarrow, and in Gateshead the\r\npoor were idle and hungry, while the wealthy were feverishly\r\napprehensive. A Sabbath quiet had fallen on the great silent highway of\r\nthe Tyne. In those blazing days and breathless nights there was an\r\nunbroken stillness that portended dire disaster.\r\n\r\nIn the enormous crowded districts on each side of the river the gaunt\r\nspectre Starvation stalked through the cheerless homes of once\r\nindustrious toilers, and the inmates pined and died. So terrible was the\r\ndistress already, that domestic pets were being killed and eaten, dogs\r\nand cats being no uncommon dish, the very offal thrown aside being\r\ngreedily devoured by those slowly succumbing to a horrible death. Awful\r\nscenes of suffering and blank despair were being witnessed on every\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThree days after the enemy had ascended the Humber and dealt such a\r\ndecisive blow at Hull, the port of South Shields was suddenly alarmed by\r\ninformation telegraphed from the Coastguard on Harton Down Hill, about\r\na mile south of the town, to the effect that they had sighted a number\r\nof French and Russian ships.\r\n\r\nPanic at once ensued. The broad market-place was filled by a\r\nterror-stricken crowd of townspeople, while the seafaring population\r\nsurged down King Street and Ocean Road, across the park to the long\r\nSouth Pier at the entrance to the Tyne, eager to reassure themselves\r\nthat the enemy had no designs upon their town.\r\n\r\nIn the dull red afterglow that lit up the broad bay of golden sand\r\nbetween Trow Point and the pier, a huge vessel suddenly loomed dark upon\r\nthe sky line, and, as she approached, those watching anxiously through\r\nglasses made her out as the great steel turret-ship _Lazare Carnot_,\r\nflying the French Tricolor. Immediately following her came a number of\r\ncruisers, gunboats, and torpedo boats. They included the _Dimitri\r\nDonskoi_, the _Kniaz Pojarski_, the _Pamyat Merkuriya_, the _Mezen_, the\r\n_Syzran_, the _Griden_, and the _Gaidamak_, all of which had taken part\r\nin the attack on Hull, while they had now been joined by the French\r\nbattleships _Massena_ and _Neptune_, the small cruisers _Cosamo_,\r\n_Desaix_, _D'Estaing_, _Coetlogon_, and _Lalande_, the torpedo gunboats\r\n_Iberville_, _Lance_, _Leger_, and _Fleche_, and the gun-vessels\r\n_Etoile_, _Fulton_, _Gabes_, _Sagittaire_, and _Vipere_, with a large\r\nnumber of torpedo boats and \"catchers,\" in addition to those which were\r\nat Hull.\r\n\r\nAs the vessels steamed onward at full speed, the people rushed from the\r\npier back again into the town in wild disorder, while the Coastguard at\r\nSpanish Battery on the north shore of the estuary, having now discovered\r\nthe presence of the menacing ships, at once telegraphed the intelligence\r\nup to Newcastle, where the most profound sensation was immediately\r\ncaused. The news spread everywhere, and the people on the Tyneside knew\r\nthat the hand of the oppressor was upon them.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without warning, smoke tumbled over the bows of the _Lazare\r\nCarnot_. There was a low boom, and one of the ponderous guns in her\r\nturret sent forth an enormous shell, which struck the battery at Trow\r\nPoint, blowing away a portion of a wall.\r\n\r\nA moment later the battery replied with their 9-tonners, sending forth\r\nshot after shot, most of which, however, ricochetted away over the\r\nglassy sea. It was the signal for a fight which quickly became\r\ndesperate.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments half a dozen of the ships lay broadside on, and the\r\ngreat guns of the _Massena_ and _Neptune_, with those of four other\r\nvessels, opened a terrible fire upon the fort, casting their shells upon\r\nthe British gunners with frightful effect.\r\n\r\nIn the battery the Armstrong disappearing guns were worked to their\r\nutmost capacity, and the shots of the defenders played havoc with the\r\nsmaller craft, three torpedo boats and a \"catcher\" being sunk in as many\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the _Active_, _Bonaventure_, _Cambrian_, _Canada_, and\r\n_Archer_ of the Reserve Squadron, now on its way from the north of\r\nScotland in consequence of orders from the Admiralty having reached it,\r\nrounded Sharpness Point, and steamed full upon the enemy's ships.\r\n\r\nThe conflict was fierce, but quickly ended.\r\n\r\nHeavy fire was kept up from the fort at Tynemouth, from Spanish Battery,\r\nfrom Trow Battery, and from several new batteries with disappearing guns\r\nbetween the Groyne and the quarry at Trow, that had been constructed and\r\nmanned since the mobilisation by Volunteers, consisting of the 1st\r\nNewcastle Volunteer Engineers, the 3rd Durham Volunteer Artillery, and\r\nthe 4th Durham Light Infantry from Newcastle. Nevertheless the\r\nassistance received by the British ships from the land was of but little\r\navail, for a Russian torpedo boat sent forth its messenger of death at\r\nthe third-class cruiser _Canada_, blowing her up, while the engines of\r\nboth the _Active_ and _Bonaventure_ were so seriously damaged as to be\r\npractically useless. Rapid signalling by the semaphore at Spanish\r\nBattery had placed the defenders on the alert, and although the British\r\nwere suffering so heavily on account of their minority, still the enemy\r\nwere everywhere feeling the effect of the hot and unexpected reception.\r\n\r\nBefore half an hour had passed two Russian gunboats had been torpedoed,\r\nand the French cruiser _D'Estaing_, having caught fire, was burning\r\nfuriously, many of her crew perishing at their guns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE TYNE DISTRICT.]\r\n\r\nThe _Lazare Carnot_ and the _Massena_, heedless of the fire from the\r\nshore, steamed at half speed across the estuary until they were opposite\r\nthe Tynemouth Battery, when they suddenly opened fire, being quickly\r\njoined by six French and Russian cruisers. In the meantime the contact\r\nmines were being blown up by piquet boats, who, although suffering\r\nheavily from the fire from the shore, nevertheless continued their task.\r\nIt was then seen how utterly inadequate were the defences of the Tyne,\r\nand what negligence had been displayed on the part of the War Office in\r\nnot providing at Tynemouth adequate means of warding off or successfully\r\ncoping with an attack.\r\n\r\nFrom behind the tall grey lighthouse a few guns were thundering, but in\r\nface of the overwhelming force at sea it was but a sorry attempt. One\r\nshot from the battery severely damaged the superstructure of the _Lazare\r\nCarnot_, another cut through the funnel of the _Neptune_, carrying it\r\naway, and a third entering the magazine of one of the small cruisers\r\ncaused it to explode with serious loss of life. Yet the devastating\r\neffect of the enemy's shells on the obsolete defences of Tynemouth was\r\nappalling.\r\n\r\nEnclosed in the fortifications were the crumbling ruins of the ancient\r\nPriory, with its restored chapel, a graveyard, and an old Castle that\r\nhad been converted into artillery barracks. As flame and smoke rushed\r\ncontinuously from the barbettes, turrets, and broadsides of the hostile\r\nships, the shots brought down the bare, dark old walls of the Priory,\r\nand, crashing into the Castle, played havoc with the building. The\r\nlantern of the lighthouse, too, was carried away, probably by a shot\r\nflying accidentally wide, and every moment death and desolation was\r\nbeing spread throughout the fort. Such a magnificent natural position,\r\ncommanding as it did the whole estuary of the Tyne, should have been\r\nrendered impregnable, yet, as it remained in 1894, so it stood on this\r\nfatal day, a typical example of War Office apathy and shortsightedness.\r\n\r\nIts guns were a mere make-believe, that gave the place an appearance of\r\nstrength that it did not possess. In the North Battery, on the left\r\nside, commanding a broad sweep of sea beyond Sharpness, only one gun, a\r\n64-pounder, was mounted, the remaining five rotting platforms being\r\nunoccupied! At the extreme point, to command the mouth of the river, a\r\nsingle 5-tonner was placed well forward with great ostentation, its\r\nweight, calibre, and other details having been painted up in conspicuous\r\nwhite letters, for the delectation of an admiring public admitted to\r\nview the Priory. The South Battery, a trifle stronger, was,\r\nnevertheless, a sheer burlesque, its weakness being a disgrace to the\r\nBritish nation. In fact, in the whole of the battery the upper defences\r\nhad long been known to experts to be obsolete, and the lower ones\r\ntotally inadequate for the resistance they should have been able to\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nWas it any wonder, then, that the shells of the enemy should cause such\r\nfrightful destruction? Among the British artillerymen there was no lack\r\nof courage, for they exerted every muscle in their gallant efforts to\r\nrepulse the foe. Yet, handicapped as they were by lack of efficient arms\r\nand properly constructed fortifications, their heroic struggles were\r\nfutile, and they sacrificed their lives to no purpose. The deadly hail\r\nfrom the floating monsters swept away the whole of the ancient Priory\r\nwalls, demolishing the old red brick barracks, blowing up the Castle\r\ngateway, wrecking the guardroom, and igniting the Priory Chapel. The\r\nloss of life was terrible, the whole of the men manning the 5-ton gun\r\npointing seaward having been killed by a single shell that burst among\r\nthem, while everywhere else men of the Royal Artillery, and those of the\r\nTynemouth Volunteer Artillery, who were assisting, were killed or maimed\r\nby the incessant rain of projectiles.\r\n\r\nNight clouds gathered black and threatening, and it appeared as if the\r\nenemy were carrying all before them. The French battleship _Neptune_,\r\nseeing the guns of all three batteries had been considerably weakened,\r\nwas steaming slowly into the mouth of the Tyne, followed by the Russian\r\ncruiser _Syzran_, when suddenly two terrific explosions occurred,\r\nshaking both North and South Shields to their very foundations. High\r\ninto the air the water rose, and it was then seen that two submarine\r\nmines had been exploded simultaneously by electric current from the\r\nTynemouth Battery, and that both vessels had been completely blown up.\r\nSuch was the force of the explosion, that the hull of the _Neptune_, a\r\ngreat armour-clad of over ten thousand tons, had been ripped up like\r\npaper, and of her crew scarcely a man escaped, while the cruiser had\r\nbeen completely broken in half, and many of her crew blown to atoms.\r\nScarcely had this success of the defenders been realised when it was\r\nfollowed by another, for a second later a British torpedo boat succeeded\r\nin blowing up with all hands the French torpedo gunboat _Lance_.\r\n\r\nThese reverses, however, caused but little dismay among the invaders,\r\nfor ere long the British cruisers had been driven off, the guns at Trow\r\nhad been silenced, while those at Spanish Battery and Tynemouth could\r\nonly keep up a desultory fire. Then, in the falling gloom, ship after\r\nship, guided by foreign pilots, and carefully evading a number of hulks\r\nthat had been placed near the estuary, entered the Tyne, pouring forth\r\ntheir heavy monotonous fire into North Shields and South Shields.\r\nSkilfully as the despairing defenders managed their submarine mines,\r\nthey only succeeded in destroying three more of the enemy's ships, the\r\nFrench torpedo gunboats _Iberville_ and _Cassini_ and the cruiser\r\n_Desaix_, the crews perishing.\r\n\r\nNot for a moment was there a cessation of the cannonade as the smaller\r\nships of the enemy advanced up the river, and the damage wrought by\r\ntheir shells was enormous. Tynemouth had already suffered heavily, many\r\nof the streets being in flames. The tower of St. Saviour's Church had\r\nfallen, the conspicuous spire of the Congregational Chapel had been shot\r\naway, the Piers Office had been reduced to ruins, and the long building\r\nof the Royal Hotel completely wrecked. The houses facing Percy Park had\r\nin many cases been shattered, a shell exploding under the archway of the\r\nBath Hotel had demolished it, and the handsome clock tower at the end of\r\nthe road had been hurled down and scattered.\r\n\r\nSlackening opposite the Scarp, the gunboats and cruisers belched forth\r\nshot and shell upon North Shields, aiming first at the more conspicuous\r\nobjects, such as the Sailors' Home, the Custom House, the tall tower of\r\nChrist Church, and the Harbour Master's office, either totally\r\ndestroying them or injuring them irreparably, while the houses on Union\r\nQuay and those in Dockway Square and in adjoining streets, from the\r\ngasometers down to the Town Hall, were also swept by shells. Resistance\r\nwas made from Fort Clifford on the one side of the town, from a position\r\noccupied by a battery of the Durham Volunteer Artillery, who had mounted\r\nguns on the hill behind Smith's Yard, and also by the submarine mines of\r\nthe Tyne Division Volunteer Miners; but it was most ineffectual, and,\r\nwhen night fell, hundreds of terror-stricken persons had been killed,\r\nand the town was on fire in dozens of places, the flames illuminating\r\nthe sky with their lurid brilliancy.\r\n\r\nIn South Shields tragic scenes were being enacted. Shells flying about\r\nthe town from the river on the one side and the sea on the other\r\nexploded in the streets, blowing unfortunate men, women, and children\r\ninto atoms, wrecking public buildings, and setting fire to the cherished\r\nhomes of the toilers. The congested blocks of buildings around Panash\r\nPoint were one huge furnace; the Custom House, the River Police Station,\r\nand the Plate Glass Works were wrecked, while a shell exploding in one\r\nof the petroleum tanks on the Commissioners' Wharf caused it to burst\r\nwith fearful effect. The queer old turret of St. Hilda's fell with a\r\ncrash, the Church of St. Stephen was practically demolished, and the\r\nschool in the vicinity unroofed. The dome of the Marine School was\r\ncarried bodily away; nothing remained standing of the Wouldhave Memorial\r\nClock but a few feet of the square lower structure, and the Ingham\r\nInfirmary being set on fire, several of the patients lost their lives.\r\nAmid this frightful panic, Lieut.-Col. Gowans and Major Carr of the 3rd\r\nDurham Artillery, the Mayor, Mr. Readhead, Alderman Rennoldson,\r\nCouncillors Lisle, Marshall, and Stainton, the Town Clerk, Mr. Hayton,\r\nand the Rev. H. E. Savage, were all conspicuous for the coolness they\r\ndisplayed. Courage, however, was unavailing, for South Shields was at\r\nthe mercy of the invaders, and all defence was feeble and futile.\r\nHundreds of the townspeople were killed by flying fragments of shells,\r\nhundreds more were buried in the debris of tottering buildings, while\r\nthose who survived fled horror-stricken with their valuables away into\r\nthe country, beyond the range of the enemy's fire.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of Hull were being repeated. The streets ran with the\r\nlife-blood of unoffending British citizens.\r\n\r\nAs evening wore on, the invaders came slowly up the Tyne, heedless of\r\nthe strenuous opposition with which they were met by Volunteer\r\nArtillery, who, having established batteries on various positions\r\nbetween Shields and Newcastle, poured a hot fire upon them. Advancing,\r\ntheir terrible guns spread death and destruction on either bank.\r\n\r\nThe crowds of idle shipping in the great Tyne Dock at South Shields, and\r\nthose in the Albert Edward and Northumberland Docks on the north bank,\r\ntogether with the staiths, warehouses, and offices, were blazing\r\nfuriously, while the Tyne Commissioners' great workshops, Edwards'\r\nShipbuilding Yard, and many other factories and shipbuilding yards, were\r\neither set on fire or seriously damaged.\r\n\r\nMany of the affrighted inhabitants of North Shields sought refuge in the\r\nrailway tunnel, and so escaped, but hundreds lost their lives in the\r\nneighbourhood of Wallsend and Percy Main.\r\n\r\nShells fell in Swinburne's brass foundry at Carville, destroying the\r\nbuildings, together with the Carville Hotel and the railway viaduct\r\nbetween that place and Howdon.\r\n\r\nThe Wallsend Railway Station and the Theatre of Varieties were blown to\r\natoms, and the houses both at High and Low Walker suffered severely,\r\nwhile opposite at Jarrow enormous damage was everywhere caused. At the\r\nlatter place the 1st Durham Volunteer Engineers rendered excellent\r\ndefensive service under Lieut.-Col. Price and Major Forneaux, and the\r\nMayor was most energetic in his efforts to insure the safety of the\r\npeople. A submarine mine had been laid opposite Hebburn, and, being\r\nsuccessfully exploded, blew to atoms the French gunboat _Gabes_, and at\r\nthe same time seriously injured the propeller of the cruiser _Cosamo_.\r\nThis vessel subsequently broke down, and a second mine fired from the\r\nshore destroyed her also. Nevertheless the invaders steadily advanced up\r\nthe broad river, blowing up obstacles, dealing decisive blows, and\r\ndestroying human life and valuable property with every shot from their\r\nmerciless weapons.\r\n\r\nThe panic that night in Newcastle was terrible. The streets were in a\r\nturmoil of excitement, for the reports from Tynemouth had produced the\r\nmost intense alarm and dismay. On receipt of the first intelligence the\r\nFree Library Committee of the City Council happened to be sitting, and\r\nthe chairman, Alderman H. W. Newton, the popular representative of All\r\nSaints' North, formally announced it to his colleagues, among whom was\r\nthe Mayor. The committee broke up in confusion, and an excited\r\nconsultation followed, in which Councillors Durnford, Fitzgerald, and\r\nFlowers, with Alderman Sutton, took part. Capt. Nicholls, the Chief\r\nConstable, Major A. M. Potter of the 1st Northumberland Artillery,\r\nLieut.-Col. Angus of the 1st Newcastle Volunteer Artillery, Lieut.-Col.\r\nPalmer and Major Emley of the Volunteer Engineers, Mr. Hill Motum, and\r\nMr. Joseph Cowen also entered the room and engaged in the discussion.\r\n\r\nAt such a hasty informal meeting, nothing, however, could be done. The\r\nMayor and Councillors were assured by the Volunteer officers that\r\neverything possible under the circumstances had been arranged for the\r\ndefence of the Tyne. Property worth millions was at stake, and now that\r\nthe news had spread from mouth to mouth the streets around the Town Hall\r\nwere filled with crowds of excited, breathless citizens, anxious to know\r\nwhat steps were being taken to insure their protection.\r\n\r\nSo loudly did they demand information, that the Mayor was compelled to\r\nappear for a moment and address a few words to them, assuring them that\r\narrangements had been made which he hoped would be found adequate to\r\nrepel the foe. This appeased them in a measure, and the crowd dispersed;\r\nbut in the other thoroughfares the excitement was intensified, and\r\nfamished thousands rushed aimlessly about, many going out upon the High\r\nLevel and Low Level Bridges and straining their eyes down the river in\r\nendeavour to catch a glimpse of the enemy.\r\n\r\nHeavy and continuous firing could be heard as the dark evening dragged\r\non, and presently, just before nine o'clock, the anxious ones upon the\r\nbridges saw the flash of guns as the invading vessels rounded the sharp\r\nbend of the river at the ferry beyond Rotterdam Wharf.\r\n\r\nThe sight caused the people to rush panic-stricken up into the higher\r\nparts of Newcastle or across the bridges into Gateshead, and from both\r\ntowns a rapid exodus was taking place, thousands fleeing into the\r\ncountry. From gun-vessels, torpedo gunboats, and cruisers, shot and\r\nshell poured in continuous streams into the wharves, shipping, and\r\ncongested masses of houses on either bank.\r\n\r\nThe houses along City Road, St. Lawrence Road, Quality Row, and Byker\r\nBank, on the outskirts of Newcastle, suffered severely, while shots\r\ndamaged the great Ouseburn Viaduct, wrecked St. Dominic's Roman Catholic\r\nChapel, and blew away the roof of the new Board School, a prominent\r\nfeature of the landscape.\r\n\r\nSeveral shells fell and exploded in Jesmond Vale. One burst and set fire\r\nto the Sandyford Brewery, and one or two falling in Portland Road caused\r\nwidespread destruction and terrible loss of life. The London and Hamburg\r\nWharves, with the shipping lying near, were soon blazing furiously, and\r\nall along Quay Side, right up to the Guildhall, shops and offices were\r\nevery moment being destroyed and swept away. New Greenwich and South\r\nShore on the Gateshead side were vigorously attacked, and many shots\r\nfired over the Salt Marshes fell in the narrow thoroughfares that lie\r\nbetween Sunderland Road and Brunswick Street.\r\n\r\nUpon the enemy's ships the Volunteer batteries on the commanding\r\npositions on either side of the high banks poured a galling fire, one\r\nbattery at the foot of the Swing Bridge on the Gateshead side effecting\r\nterrible execution. Their guns had been well laid, and the salvoes of\r\nshell played about the French gun-vessels and torpedo boats, causing\r\nfrightful destruction among the crews. Both Newcastle and Gateshead,\r\nlying so much higher than the river, were in a certain measure\r\nprotected, and the high banks afforded a wide command over the waterway.\r\nAt various points, including the entrances to the High Level Bridge, at\r\nthe Side, the Close, New Chatham, and the Rabbit Banks, the Volunteers\r\nhad opened fire, and were keeping up a terrible cannonade. The dark\r\nriver reflected the red light which flashed forth every moment from gun\r\nmuzzles, while search-lights from both ships and shore were constantly\r\nstreaming forth, and the thunder of war shook the tall factory chimneys\r\nto their very foundations.\r\n\r\nHeedless of the strenuous opposition, the invading ships kept up a\r\nvigorous fire, which, aimed high, fell in the centre of Newcastle with\r\nmost appalling effect. In the midst of the crowds in Newgate and\r\nPilgrim Streets shells exploded, blowing dozens of British citizens to\r\natoms and tearing out the fronts of shops. One projectile, aimed at the\r\nstrangely shaped tower of St. Nicholas' Cathedral, struck it, and swept\r\naway the thin upper portion, and another, crashing into the sloping roof\r\nof the grim, time-mellowed relic Black Gate, shattered it, and tore away\r\npart of the walls.\r\n\r\nThe old castle and the railway bridge were also blown up in the earlier\r\nstages of the bombardment, and the square tower of St. John's fell with\r\na sudden crash right across the street, completely blocking it. From end\r\nto end Grainger Street was swept by French melinite shells, which,\r\nbursting in rapid succession, filled the air with tiny flying fragments,\r\neach as fatal as a bullet fired from a rifle. The French shell is much\r\nmore formidable than ours, for, while the latter breaks into large\r\npieces, the former is broken up into tiny and exceedingly destructive\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this terrible panic a shot cut its way through the Earl\r\nGrey Monument, causing it to fall, many persons being crushed to death\r\nbeneath the stones, while both the Central Exchange and the Theatre\r\nRoyal were now alight, shedding a brilliant glare skyward.\r\n\r\nAt this time, too, the whole of Quay Side was a mass of roaring,\r\ncrackling flames, the thin spire of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral\r\nhad been shot away, Bainbridge's great emporium was blazing furiously,\r\nand the Art Club premises had taken fire. One shot had fallen at the\r\nback of the Town Hall, and torn an enormous hole in the wall, while\r\nanother, entering the first floor of the County Hotel, had burst with\r\nawful force, and carried away the greater part of its gloomy facade.\r\n\r\nIn the Central Station opposite, dozens of shells had exploded, and it\r\nwas now on fire, hopelessly involved together with the adjoining Station\r\nHotel. The grey front of the imposing _Chronicle_ building had been\r\nwrecked by a shell that had descended upon the roof, and a row of dark\r\nold-fashioned houses in Eldon Square had been demolished.\r\n\r\nThe same fate had been shared by the Co-operative Wholesale Society's\r\nwarehouse, the Fish Market, the _Journal_ office, and both the Crown and\r\nMetropole Hotels at the bottom of Clayton Street.\r\n\r\nYet the firing continued; the terrified citizens were granted no\r\nquarter. The Royal Arcade was blown to atoms, the new red brick\r\nbuildings of the Prudential Assurance Company were set on fire, and were\r\nblazing with increasing fury. The building of the North British and\r\nMercantile Assurance Company, the Savings Bank at the corner of Newgate\r\nStreet, and the Empire Theatre were wrecked. Along New Bridge Street\r\ndozens of houses were blown to pieces, several fine residences in\r\nEllison Place were utterly demolished and blocked the roadway with their\r\ndebris, and the whole city, from the river up to Brandling Village, was\r\nswept time after time by salvoes of devastating shots. Rows of houses\r\nfell, and in hundreds the terrified people were massacred. Away over the\r\nNun's Moor shells were hurled and burst, and others were precipitated\r\ninto the great Armstrong works at Elswick.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the midst of the incessant thunder, a series of terrific\r\nexplosions occurred, and the great High Level Bridge collapsed, and fell\r\nwith an awful crash into the Tyne. The enemy had placed dynamite under\r\nthe huge brick supports, and blown them up simultaneously. A few moments\r\nlater the Swing Bridge was treated in similar manner; but the enemy,\r\nunder the galling fire from the Volunteer batteries, were now losing\r\nfrightfully. Many of the new guns at the Elswick works were brought into\r\naction, and several ironclads in the course of construction afforded\r\ncover to those desperately defending their homes.\r\n\r\nBut this blow of the invaders had been struck at a most inopportune\r\nmoment, and was evidently the result of an order that had been\r\nimperfectly understood. It caused them to suffer a greater disaster than\r\nthey had anticipated. Six torpedo boats and two gun-vessels had passed\r\nunder the bridge, and, lying off the Haughs, were firing into the\r\nElswick works at the moment when the bridges were demolished, and the\r\ndebris, falling across the stream, cut off all means of escape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEWCASTLE BOMBARDED: BLOWING UP OF THE HIGH LEVEL\r\nBRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nThe defenders, noticing this, worked on, pounding away at the hostile\r\ncraft with merciless monotony, until one after another the French and\r\nRussians were blown to atoms, and their vessels sank beneath them into\r\nthe dark, swirling waters.\r\n\r\nWhile this was proceeding, two mines, one opposite Hill Gate, at\r\nGateshead, and the other near the Rotterdam Wharf, on the Newcastle\r\nside, were fired by the Volunteer Engineers, who thus succeeded in\r\nblowing up two more French gunboats, while the battery at the foot of\r\nthe Swing Bridge sank two more torpedo boats, and that in front of the\r\nChemical Works at Gateshead sent a shell into the \"vitals\" of one of the\r\nmost powerful torpedo gunboats, with the result that she blew up.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the enemy were being cut to pieces.\r\n\r\nSeeing the trap into which their vessels had fallen above the ruined\r\nbridges, and feeling that they had caused sufficient damage, they\r\nturned, and with their guns still belching forth flame, steamed at half\r\nspeed back again towards the sea.\r\n\r\nBut they were not allowed to escape so easily, for the mines recently\r\nlaid by the Volunteers were now brought into vigorous play, and in the\r\nlong reach of the river between High Walker and Wallsend no fewer than\r\nsix more of the enemy's gun and torpedo boats had their bottoms blown\r\nout, and their crews torn limb from limb.\r\n\r\nFlashed throughout the land, the news of the enemy's repulse, though\r\ngained at such enormous loss, excited a feeling of profound\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe injury inflicted on the invaders had been terrible, and from that\r\nattack upon the Tyne they had been hurled reeling back the poorer by the\r\nloss of a whole fleet of torpedo and gun boats, one of the most\r\neffective arms of their squadrons, while the sea had closed over one of\r\nFrance's proudest battleships, the _Neptune_, and no fewer than four of\r\nher cruisers.\r\n\r\nThe surviving vessels, which retreated round the Black Middens and\r\ngained the open sea, all more or less had their engines crippled, and\r\nnot half the men that had manned them escaped alive.\r\n\r\nThey had wrought incalculable damage, it is true, for part of Newcastle\r\nwas burning, and the loss of life had been terrible; yet they were\r\ndriven back by the Volunteers' desperately vigorous fire, and the lives\r\nof many thousands in Newcastle and Gateshead had thus been saved at the\r\neleventh hour by British patriots.\r\n\r\nAlas, it was a black day in England's history!\r\n\r\nWas this to be a turning-point in the wave of disaster which had swept\r\nso suddenly upon our land?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nHELP FROM OUR COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDays passed--dark, dismal, dispiriting. Grim-visaged War had crushed all\r\njoy and gaiety from British hearts, and fierce patriotism and\r\ndetermination to fight on until the bitter end mingled everywhere with\r\nhunger, sadness, and despair. British homes had been desecrated, British\r\nlives had been sacrificed, and through the land the invaders rushed\r\nravaging with fire and sword.\r\n\r\nWhole towns had been overwhelmed and shattered, great tracts of rich\r\nland in Sussex and Hampshire had been laid waste, and the people,\r\npowerless against the enormous forces sweeping down upon them, had been\r\nmercilessly mowed down and butchered by Cossacks, whose brutality was\r\nfiendish. Everywhere there were reports of horrible atrocities, of\r\nheartless murders, and wholesale slaughter of the helpless and\r\nunoffending.\r\n\r\nThe situation, both in Great Britain and on the Continent, was most\r\ncritical. The sudden declaration of hostilities by France and Russia had\r\nresulted in a great war in which nearly all European nations were\r\ninvolved. Germany had sent her enormous land forces over her frontiers\r\neast and west, successfully driving back the French along the Vosges,\r\nand occupying Dijon, Chalons-sur-Saone, and Lyons. Valmy, Nancy, and\r\nMetz had again been the scenes of sanguinary encounters, and Chaumont\r\nand Troyes had both fallen into the hands of the Kaiser's legions. In\r\nPoland, however, neither Germans nor Austrians had met with such\r\nsuccess. A fierce battle had been fought at Thorn between the Tsar's\r\nforces and the Germans, and the former, after a desperate stand, were\r\ndefeated, and the Uhlans, dragoons, and infantry of the Fatherland had\r\nswept onward up the valley of the Vistula to Warsaw. Here the resistance\r\noffered by General Bodisco was very formidable, but the city was\r\nbesieged, while fierce fighting was taking place all across the level\r\ncountry that lay between the Polish capital and the Prussian frontier.\r\nAustrians and Hungarians fought fiercely, the Tyrolese Jaegers displaying\r\nconspicuous bravery at Brody, Cracow, Jaroslav, and along the banks of\r\nthe San, and they had succeeded up to the present in preventing the\r\nCossacks and Russian infantry from reaching the Carpathians, although an\r\nAustrian army corps advancing into Russia along the Styr had been\r\nseverely cut up and forced to retreat back to Lemberg.\r\n\r\nItaly had burst her bonds. Her Bersaglieri, cuirassiers, Piedmontese\r\ncavalry, and carabiniers had marched along the Corniche road into\r\nProvence, and, having occupied Nice, Cannes, and Draguigan, were on\r\ntheir way to attack Marseilles, while the Alpine infantry, taking the\r\nroad over Mont Cenis, had, after very severe fighting in the beautiful\r\nvalley between Susa and Bardonnechia, at last occupied Modane and\r\nChambery, and now intended joining hands with the Germans at Lyons.\r\n\r\nFrance was now receiving greater punishment than she had anticipated,\r\nand even those members of the Cabinet and Deputies who were responsible\r\nfor the sudden invasion of England were compelled to admit that they had\r\nmade a false move. The frontiers were being ravaged, and although the\r\nterritorial regiments remaining were considered sufficient to repel\r\nattack, yet the Army of the Saone had already been cut to pieces. In\r\nthese circumstances, France, knowing the great peril she ran in\r\nprolonging the invasion of Britain, was desperately anxious to make the\r\nBritish sue for peace, so that she could turn her attention to events at\r\nhome, and therefore, although in a measure contravening International\r\nLaw, she had instructed her Admirals to bombard British seaports and\r\npartially-defended towns.\r\n\r\nAlthough the guns of the hostile fleet had wrought such appalling havoc\r\non the Humber, on the Tyne, and along the coast of Kent and Sussex,\r\nnevertheless the enemy had only secured a qualified success. The cause\r\nof all the disasters that had befallen us, of the many catastrophes on\r\nland and sea, was due to the wretchedly inadequate state of our Navy,\r\nalthough the seven new battleships and six cruisers commenced in 1894\r\nwere now complete and afloat.\r\n\r\nHad we possessed an efficient Navy the enemy could never have approached\r\nour shores. We had not a sufficient number of ships to replace\r\ncasualties. Years behind in nearly every essential point, Britain had\r\nfailed to give her cruisers either speed or guns equal in strength to\r\nthose of other nations. Our guns were the worst in the world, no fewer\r\nthan 47 vessels still mounting 350 old muzzleloaders, weapons discarded\r\nby every other European Navy.\r\n\r\nFor years it had been a race between the hare and the tortoise. We had\r\nremained in dreamy unconsciousness of danger, while other nations had\r\nquickly taken advantage of all the newly-discovered modes of destruction\r\nthat make modern warfare so terrible.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the odds against us in nearly every particular, the\r\nBritish losses had been nothing as compared with those of the enemy.\r\nThis spoke much for British pluck and pertinacity. With a force against\r\nthem of treble their strength, British bluejackets had succeeded in\r\nsinking a number of the finest and most powerful ships of France and\r\nRussia. France had lost the _Amiral Duperre_, a magnificent steel vessel\r\nof eleven thousand tons; the _Neptune_ and _Redoutable_, a trifle\r\nsmaller; the _Tonnerre_, the _Terrible_, the _Furieux_, the\r\n_Indomptable_, the _Caiman_, all armoured ships, had been lost; while\r\nthe cruisers _D'Estaing_, _Sfax_, _Desaix_, _Cosamo_, _Faucon_, the\r\ndespatch-vessel _Hirondelle_, the gunboats _Iberville_, _Gabes_, and\r\n_Lance_, and eleven others, together with sixteen torpedo boats and\r\nnumbers of transports, had been either blown up, burned, or otherwise\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe losses the Russians had sustained, in addition to the many\r\ntransports and general service steamers, included the great steel\r\ncruiser _Nicolai I._, the vessels _Gerzog Edinburgskij_, _Syzran_,\r\n_Rynda_, _Asia_, _Gangut_, _Kranaya Gorka_, _Olaf_, and the torpedo boat\r\n_Abo_, with eight others.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of this enormous force had, of course, not been effected\r\nwithout an infliction of loss upon the defenders, yet the British\r\ncasualties bore no comparison to those of the enemy. True, the armoured\r\nturret-ship _Conqueror_ had, alas! been sacrificed; the fine\r\nbarbette-ships _Centurion_ and _Rodney_ had gone to the bottom; the\r\nsplendid first-class cruiser _Aurora_ and the cruiser _Narcissus_ had\r\nbeen blown up; while the cruisers _Terpsichore_, _Melampus_, _Tribune_,\r\n_Galatea_, and _Canada_, with a number of torpedo boats and \"catchers,\"\r\nhad also been destroyed, yet not before every crew had performed heroic\r\ndeeds worthy of record in the world's history, and every vessel had\r\nshown the French and Russians what genuine British courage could effect.\r\n\r\nStill the invaders were striking swift, terrible blows. On the Humber\r\nand the Tyne the loss of life had been appalling. The bombardment of\r\nBrighton, the sack of Eastbourne, and the occupation of the Downs by the\r\nland forces, had been effected only by wholesale rapine and awful\r\nbloodshed, and Britain waited breathlessly, wondering in what direction\r\nthe next catastrophe would occur.\r\n\r\nSuch newspapers as in these dark days continued to appear reported how\r\ngreat mass meetings were being held all over the United States,\r\ndenouncing the action of the Franco-Russian forces.\r\n\r\nIn New York, Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco,\r\nand other cities, resolutions were passed at enormous demonstrations by\r\nthe enthusiastic public, demanding that the United States Government\r\nshould give an immediate ultimatum to France that unless she withdrew\r\nher troops from British soil, war would be declared against her.\r\n\r\nSpecial sittings of Congress were being held daily at Washington for the\r\npurpose of discussing the advisability of such a step; influential\r\ndeputations waited upon the President, and all the prominent statesmen\r\nwere interviewed by the various enterprising New York journals, the\r\nresult showing a great preponderance of feeling that such a measure\r\nshould be at once taken.\r\n\r\nIn British colonies throughout the world the greatest indignation and\r\nmost intense excitement prevailed. Already bodies of Volunteers were on\r\ntheir way from Australia and Cape Town, many of the latter, under Major\r\nScott, having already been in England and shot as competitors at Bisley.\r\nFrom India a number of native regiments had embarked for Southampton,\r\nbut the Northern frontier stations had been strengthened in anticipation\r\nof a movement south by Russia, and the French Indian possessions,\r\nPondichery and Karikal, were occupied by British troops.\r\n\r\nAn expedition from Burmah had crossed the Shan States into Tonquin, and\r\nwith the assistance of the British Squadron on the China Station had,\r\nafter hard fighting, occupied a portion of the country, while part of\r\nthe force had gone farther south and commenced operations in French\r\nCochin-China by a vigorous attack on Saigon.\r\n\r\nArmed British forces had also landed in Guadaloupe and Martinique, two\r\nof the most fertile of the West Indian Islands, and St. Bartholomew had\r\nalso been occupied by West Indian regiments.\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of hostilities intense patriotism spread through Canada,\r\nand from the shores of Lake Superior away to far Vancouver a movement\r\nwas at once made to assist the Mother Country. In Quebec, Montreal,\r\nOttawa, Toronto, and Kingston mass meetings were held, urging the\r\nDominion Government to allow a force of Volunteers to go to England\r\nwithout delay; and this universal demand was the more gratifying when it\r\nwas remembered that more than a quarter of the population were\r\nthemselves French. Nevertheless the knowledge that Britain was in danger\r\nwas sufficient to arouse patriotism everywhere, and within a few days\r\n20,000 Volunteers were enrolled, and these, before a fortnight had\r\npassed, were on their way to Liverpool. Great was the enthusiasm when, a\r\nfew days later, to the strains of \"Rule, Britannia,\" the first\r\ndetachment landed in the Mersey, and as they marched through the crowded\r\nstreets, the people, delighted at this practical demonstration of\r\nsympathy, wrung the hands of the patriots of the West. Vessel after\r\nvessel, escorted by British cruisers, arrived at the landing-stage, and\r\ndischarged their regiments of men to whom the knowledge of Britain's\r\ndanger had been sufficient incentive to induce them to act their part as\r\nBritons. Then, when the last vessel had arrived, they were formed into a\r\nbrigade, and set out to march south in the direction of Birmingham.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a great loan was being floated in Australia and the United\r\nStates. The former colony had but recently passed through a serious\r\nfinancial crisis, but in America a sum of no less than L200,000,000 was\r\ntaken up, although the issue only continued a few days. In Wall Street\r\nthe excitement was intense, and the struggle to invest was desperate. No\r\nsuch scenes had ever been witnessed within the memory of the oldest\r\nmember of the Stock Exchange, for financiers were determined to assist\r\nthe greatest Power on earth; indeed, apart from the sound security\r\noffered, they felt it their duty to do so. Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane,\r\nand Calcutta all contributed in more or less degree, and the loan\r\nimmediately proved the most successful ever floated.\r\n\r\nTo Britain on every side a helping hand was outstretched, and,\r\nirrespective of politics and party bickerings, assistance was rendered\r\nin order that she might crush her enemies. Britannia gathered her\r\nstrength, and armed herself for the fierce combat which she knew must\r\ndecide the destiny of her glorious Empire.\r\n\r\nLondon, starving, terror-stricken, and haunted continually by\r\napprehensions of an unknown doom, was in a state of restlessness both\r\nnight and day. Food supplies had failed, the cheapest bread was sold at\r\n3s. 8d. a small loaf, and neither fish nor meat could be purchased.\r\n\r\nIn the City the panic was frightful. Business was paralysed, hundreds\r\nwere being ruined daily, and after the first sensation and headlong rush\r\non the Stock Exchange, transactions remained at a standstill. Then\r\nsuddenly, when the seriousness of the situation was fully understood,\r\nthere was a run on the banks.\r\n\r\nCrowds, eager and clamouring, surrounded the Bank of England, and\r\nestablishments in Lombard Street and elsewhere, with cheques in their\r\nhands, demanding their deposits in gold. Although weak and half-starved,\r\nthey desired their money in order to flee and take with them all they\r\npossessed before the enemy swept down upon London.\r\n\r\nDay and night in all the City banks the cashiers were kept paying out\r\nthousands upon thousands in hard shining gold. The clink of coin, the\r\njingle of scales, and the eager shouts of those feverishly anxious for\r\ntheir turn, and fearing the resources would not hold out, formed a loud\r\nincessant din.\r\n\r\nAs the days passed, and the run on the banks continued, one after\r\nanother of the establishments, both in the City and the West End, unable\r\nto withstand the heavy withdrawals, were compelled to close their doors.\r\nMany were banks of such high reputation that the very fact of being a\r\ndepositor was a hall-mark of a man's prosperity, while others were minor\r\nestablishments, whose business was mainly with small accounts and\r\nmiddle-class customers. One by one they failed to fulfil their\r\nobligations, and closed; and the unfortunate ones, including many women\r\nwho had not been able to struggle successfully to get inside, turned\r\naway absolutely ruined!\r\n\r\nIn the West End the starving poor had formed processions, and marched\r\nthrough Mayfair and Belgravia demanding bread, while Anarchists held\r\ncouncil in front of the blackened ruins of the National Gallery, and the\r\nUnemployed continued their declamatory oratory on Tower Hill. The\r\nstarving thousands from the East End ran riot in the aristocratic\r\nthoroughfares of Kensington, and, heedless of the police,--who were, in\r\nfact, powerless before such superior numbers,--residences of the rich\r\nwere entered and searched for food, and various acts of violence\r\nensued. The cellars of clubs, hotels, and private houses were broken\r\nopen and sacked, granaries were emptied, wholesale grocery warehouses\r\nwere looted, and flour mills searched from roof to basement. If they\r\ncould not obtain food, they said, they would drink. A desperate starving\r\ncrowd then forced an entry to the wine vaults at the Docks, and\r\nswallowed priceless vintages from pewter pots. Hogsheads of port and\r\nsherry were carried up into the streets, and amid scenes of wild\r\ndisorder were tapped and drunk by the excited and already\r\nhalf-intoxicated multitude.\r\n\r\nFor days London remained at the mercy of a drunken, frenzied rabble.\r\nMurder and incendiarism were committed in every quarter, and many\r\nserious and desperate conflicts occurred between the rioters and the\r\nlaw-abiding patriotic citizens.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm was displayed by even the latter, when an infuriated mob one\r\nnight surrounded Albert Gate House, the French Embassy, and, breaking\r\nopen the door, entered it, and flung the handsome furniture from the\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nThose below made a huge pile in the street, and when the whole of the\r\nmovable effects had been got out, the crowd set fire to them, and also\r\nto the great mansion, at the same time cheering lustily, and singing\r\n\"Rule, Britannia,\" as they watched the flames leap up and consume both\r\nhouse and furniture.\r\n\r\nThe servants of the Embassy had fortunately escaped, otherwise they\r\nwould no doubt have fared badly at the hands of the lawless assembly.\r\n\r\nWhen the fire had burned itself out, however, a suggestion was spread,\r\nand the mob with one accord rushed to the Russian Embassy in Chesham\r\nPlace.\r\n\r\nThis house was also entered, and the furniture flung pell-mell from the\r\nwindows, that too large to pass through being broken up in the rooms,\r\nand the fragments thrown to the shouting crowd below.\r\n\r\nChairs, tables, ornaments, mirrors, bedding, kitchen utensils, and\r\ncrockery were thrown out, carpets were taken up, and curtains and\r\ncornices torn down by ruthless denizens of Whitechapel and Shoreditch,\r\nwho, maddened by drink, were determined to destroy everything belonging\r\nto the countries which had brought disaster upon them.\r\n\r\nPresently, when nearly all the furniture had been removed, some man,\r\nwild-haired and excited, emerged into the street, with a great flag he\r\nhad discovered in one of the attics. With a shout of delight he unfurled\r\nit. It was a large yellow one, upon which was depicted a huge black\r\ndouble eagle; the flag that had been hoisted at the Embassy on various\r\nState occasions.\r\n\r\nIts appearance was greeted by a fearful howl of rage, and the infuriated\r\npeople, falling upon the man who waved it, tore it into shreds, which\r\nthey afterwards cast into the bonfire they had made for the Ambassador's\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nFrom the archives the secret papers and reports of spies were taken,\r\nand, being torn into fragments, were scattered from an upper window to\r\nthe winds, until at last, men, snatching up flaring brands from the huge\r\nbonfire, rushed into the dismantled mansion, and, having poured\r\npetroleum in many of the apartments, ignited them.\r\n\r\nFlames quickly spread through the house, belching forth from the\r\nwindows, and, ascending, had soon burst through the roof, illuminating\r\nthe neighbourhood with a bright, fitful glare. The mob, as the flames\r\nleaped up and crackled, screamed with fiendish delight. From thousands\r\nof hoarse throats there went up loud cries of \"Down with the Tsar! Down\r\nwith Russia!\" And as the great bonfire died down, and the roof of the\r\nEmbassy collapsed with a crash, causing the flames to shoot higher and\r\nroar more vigorously, they sang with one accord, led by a man who had\r\nmounted some railings, the stirring British song, \"The Union Jack of Old\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the colonies had shown how zealously they were prepared to\r\nguard the interests of the Mother Country, their public spirit was\r\neclipsed by the spontaneous outburst of patriotism which occurred in\r\nIreland. Mass meetings were being held in Belfast, Dublin, Cork,\r\nWaterford, Limerick, Londonderry, Sligo, Armagh, Dundalk, Newry, and\r\ndozens of other places, at which men of all grades of society\r\nunanimously decided by resolution to raise Volunteer regiments to take\r\narms against the foe.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of Britain's danger had aroused the patriotic feelings of\r\nthe people, and they were determined to give their sovereign a proof of\r\ntheir allegiance, cost what it might.\r\n\r\nThe movement was a general one. Nationalists and Unionists vied in their\r\neagerness to demonstrate their love for the Empire, and that part of it\r\nwhich was now in danger.\r\n\r\nAlready the Irish Reserve forces had been mobilised and sent to their\r\nallotted stations. The 3rd Irish Rifles from Newtownards, the 5th\r\nBattalion from Downpatrick, and the 6th from Dundalk, were at Belfast\r\nunder arms; the Donegal Artillery from Letterkenny had already gone to\r\nHarwich to assist in the defence of the east coast; and both the\r\nLondonderry and Sligo Artillery had gone to Portsmouth; while the 3rd\r\nIrish Fusiliers from Armagh were at Plymouth, and the 4th Battalion from\r\nCavan had left to assist in the defence of the Severn.\r\n\r\nWhatever differences of political opinion had previously existed between\r\nthem on the question of Home Rule, were forgotten by the people in the\r\nface of the great danger which threatened the Empire to which they\r\nbelonged. The national peril welded the people together, and shoulder to\r\nshoulder they marched to lay down their lives, if necessary, in the work\r\nof driving back the invader.\r\n\r\nWithin six days of this spontaneous outburst of patriotism, 25,000\r\nIrishmen of all creeds and political opinions were on their way to\r\nassist their English comrades. As might have been expected, the greater\r\nnumber of these Volunteers came from the North of Ireland, but every\r\ndistrict sent its sons, eager to take part in the great struggle. At the\r\ngreat meetings held at Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Limerick, Wexford,\r\nWaterford, Strabane, Newtown-Stewart, Downpatrick, Ballymena, and dozens\r\nof other places all over the country, from the Giant's Causeway to Cape\r\nClear, and from Dublin to Galway Bay, the most intense enthusiasm was\r\nshown, and men signed their names to the roll in hundreds, many\r\nsubscribing large sums to defray the cost of equipment and other\r\nexpenses. Each passenger or mail boat from Larne to Stranraer, from\r\nDublin to Holyhead, every steamer from Belfast to Whitehaven and\r\nLiverpool, brought over well-armed contingents of stalwart men, who,\r\nafter receiving hearty receptions of the most enthusiastic and\r\nflattering description, were moved south to Stamford in Lincolnshire as\r\nquickly as the disorganised railway service would allow.\r\n\r\nThe object of the military authorities in concentrating them at this\r\npoint was to strengthen the great force of defenders now marching south.\r\nDetraining at Stamford, the commanding officer had orders to march to\r\nOundle, by way of King's Cliffe and Fotheringhay, and there remain until\r\njoined by a brigade of infantry with the Canadians coming from\r\nLeicestershire. The great body of men at length mustered, answered the\r\nroll, and marched through the quiet old-world streets of Stamford, and\r\nout upon the broad highway to King's Cliffe on the first stage of their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nIt was early morning. In the sunlight the dew still glistened like\r\ndiamonds on the wayside, as regiment after regiment, with firm, steady\r\nstep, and shouldering their rifles, bravely passed away through the\r\nfields of ripe uncut corn, eager to unite with a force of Regulars, and\r\nstrike their first blow for their country's liberty.\r\n\r\nSturdy fishermen from the rough shores of Donegal marched side by side\r\nwith townsmen and artisans from Dublin, Belfast, and Limerick; sons of\r\nwealthy manufacturers in Antrim and Down bore arms with stalwart\r\npeasantry from Kerry and Tipperary; while men whose poor but cherished\r\ncabins overlooked Carlingford Lough, united with fearless patriots from\r\nCarlow, Wexford, and Waterford.\r\n\r\nSince they landed on English soil, they had met with a boundless\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nIn the rural districts the distress was not yet so great as in the\r\nlarger towns; consequently at King's Cliffe, when the first detachment\r\nhalted for rest in the long straggling street of the typical English\r\nvillage, the bells of the quaint old church were rung, and villagers\r\ngave their defenders bread, cheese, and draughts of ale. While the men\r\nwere standing at ease and eating heartily, two officers entered\r\nBailey's, the village grocery store, which served as post office, and\r\nreceived a cipher telegraphic despatch. They emerged into the roadway\r\nimmediately, and their faces showed that some unforeseen event had\r\noccurred. A third officer was summoned, and a hurried and secret\r\nconsultation took place as they stood together opposite the Cross Keys\r\nInn.\r\n\r\n\"But can we do it?\" queried the youngest of the trio, aloud, pulling on\r\nhis gloves, and settling the hang of his sword.\r\n\r\nThe grave elder man, commander of the brigade, glanced quickly at his\r\nwatch, with knit brows.\r\n\r\n\"Do it?\" he replied, with a marked Irish accent. \"We must. It'll be a\r\ndash for life; but the boys are fresh, and as duty calls, we must push\r\nonward, even though we may be marching to our doom. Go,\" he said to the\r\nyoungest of his two companions, \"tell them we are moving, and that our\r\nadvance guard will reach them at the earliest possible moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe young lieutenant hurried over to the little shop, and as he did so\r\nthe colonel gave an order, and a bugle awoke the echoes of the village.\r\n\r\nQuick words of command sounded down the quaint, ancient street, followed\r\nby the sharp click of arms. Again officers' voices sounded loud and\r\nbrief, and at the word \"March!\" the great body of stern loyalists moved\r\nonward over the bridge, and up the School Hill on to the long winding\r\nroad which led away through Apesthorpe and historic Fotheringhay to\r\nOundle.\r\n\r\nThe message from the front had been immediately responded to, for a few\r\nminutes later the excited villagers stood watching the rearguard\r\ndisappearing in the cloud of dust raised by the heavy tread of the\r\nthousand feet upon the white highway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRISH VOLUNTEERS HALTING IN KING'S CLIFFE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN ADVANCE IN THE MIDLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the land the grey-coated hordes of the White Tsar spread like\r\nlocusts--their track marked by death and desolation.\r\n\r\nBoth French and Russian troops had taken up carefully selected positions\r\non the Downs, and, backed by the enormous reinforcements now landed,\r\nwere slowly advancing. Every detail of the surprise invasion had\r\napparently been carefully considered, for immediately after the fierce\r\nbattle off Beachy Head a number of French and Russian cruisers were\r\ndespatched to the Channel ports in order to threaten them, so as to\r\nprevent many of the troops in Hampshire, Dorset, and Devon from moving\r\nto their place of assembly. Consequently large bodies of British troops\r\nwere compelled to remain inactive, awaiting probable local attacks.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the invaders lost no time in extending their flanks\r\npreparatory to a general advance, and very quickly they were in\r\npossession of all the high ground from Polegate to Steyning Down, while\r\nCossack patrols were out on the roads towards Cuckfield and West\r\nGrinstead, and demonstrations were made in the direction of Horsham,\r\nwhere a strong force of British troops had hastily collected.\r\n\r\nAs the long hot days passed, the Volunteers forming the line of defence\r\nsouth of London had not been idle. A brigade of infantry had been pushed\r\nforward to Balcombe, and with this the British were now watching the\r\nhigh ground that stretched across to Horsham.\r\n\r\nThe advance of the enemy had not, of course, been accomplished without\r\nterrible bloodshed. A division of the Regulars from Parkhurst,\r\nPortsmouth, and Winchester, which had been hurried down to Arundel to\r\noccupy a strong defensive position near that town, had come into contact\r\nwith the enemy, and some desperate fighting ensued. Outposts had been\r\nthrown across the river Arun, and about midnight a patrol of the 2nd\r\nCavalry Brigade from Petersfield, supported by infantry, had been\r\nsuddenly attacked close to Ashington village. Under a vigorous fire they\r\nwere unfortunately compelled to fall back fighting, and were almost\r\nannihilated, for it was only then ascertained that the enemy were moving\r\nin great force, evidently with the intention of obtaining possession of\r\nthe heights as far as Cocking, West Dean, and Chichester, and so\r\nthreaten Portsmouth from the land.\r\n\r\nThe survivors of this cavalry patrol succeeded in recrossing the Arun,\r\nbut their losses were exceedingly heavy.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the enemy were visible from Arundel, and shot and shell were\r\npoured into them from the batteries established along the hills to\r\nHoughton. So heavy was the British fire that the Russians were compelled\r\nto seek cover, and their advance in this direction was, for this time,\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\nThe defenders, although occupying an excellent position, were, however,\r\nnot sufficiently strong to successfully cope with the onward rush of\r\ninvaders, and could do little else beyond watching them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Russians, displaying great tactical skill, and\r\nled by men who had thoroughly studied the geography of the South of\r\nEngland, had gained a distinct advantage, for they had secured their\r\nleft flank from attack, so that they could now advance northward to\r\nHorsham and Balcombe practically unmolested.\r\n\r\nThe first general movement commenced at noon, when an advance was made\r\nby two enormous columns of the enemy, one of which proceeded by way of\r\nHenfield and Partridge Green and the other by Cooksbridge and Keynes,\r\nthe third column remaining in Sussex to protect the base of operations.\r\nMeanwhile, Horsham had been occupied by a portion of the 2nd division of\r\nthe 1st Army Corps with a 12-pounder, a 9-pounder field battery, and a\r\nfield company of the Royal Engineers, and had been placed in a state of\r\nhasty defence. Walls had been loopholed, fences had been cut down, and\r\nvarious preparations made for holding the town.\r\n\r\nOur forces were, nevertheless, sadly lacking in numbers. A cavalry\r\npatrol of one of our flying columns was captured by Cossacks at Cowfold,\r\nand the neglect on the part of the commander of this column to send out\r\nhis advance guard sufficiently far, resulted in it being hurled back\r\nupon the main body in great disorder. Then, seeing the success\r\neverywhere attending their operations, the invaders turned their\r\nattention to the British line of communication between Horsham and\r\nArundel, and succeeded in breaking it at Billinghurst and at Petworth.\r\n\r\nFierce fighting spread all over Sussex, and everywhere many lives were\r\nbeing sacrificed for Britain. The defenders, alas! with their weak and\r\ntotally inadequate forces, could make but a sorry stand against the\r\noverwhelming masses of French and Russians, yet they acted with\r\nconspicuous bravery to sustain the honour of their native land. Villages\r\nand towns were devastated, rural homes were sacked and burned, and\r\neverywhere quiet, unoffending, but starving Britons were being put to\r\nthe sword.\r\n\r\nOver Sussex the reign of terror was awful. The pastures were stained by\r\nBritons' life-blood, and in all directions our forces, though displaying\r\ntheir characteristic courage, were being routed. At Horsham they were\r\nutterly defeated after a fierce and bloody encounter, in which the enemy\r\nalso lost very heavily; yet the cause of the British reverse was due\r\nsolely to a defective administration. Hurriedly massed in the town from\r\nAldershot by way of Guildford, they had, owing to the short-sighted\r\npolicy of the War Office, arrived without a sufficient supply of either\r\ntransport or ammunition. Night was falling as they detrained, and in the\r\nhopeless confusion battalion commanders could not find their brigade\r\nheadquarters, and brigadiers could not find their staff.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary muddle resulted in the fresh troops, instead of being\r\nsent forward to reinforce the outposts, being kept in town, while the\r\njaded, ill-fed men, who had already been on the alert many hours, were\r\nutterly unable to resist the organised attack which was made before\r\ndaybreak.\r\n\r\nThough they made a gallant stand and fought on with desperate\r\ndetermination, yet at last the whole of them were driven back in\r\nconfusion, and with appalling loss, upon their supports, and the latter,\r\nwho held out bravely, were at last also compelled to fall back upon\r\ntheir reserves. The latter, which included half a battery of artillery\r\nstationed at Wood's Farm and Toll Bar, held the enemy in temporary\r\ncheck; but when the heavy French artillery was at length brought up, the\r\ninvaders were enabled to cut the railway, destroy the half battery at\r\nWood's Farm, turn the British right flank, and compel them to retreat\r\nhastily from Horsham and fly to defensive positions at Guildford and\r\nDorking.\r\n\r\nBy this adroit manoeuvre the enemy succeeded in taking over two hundred\r\nprisoners, capturing the guns of the 12-pounder field battery,--which\r\nhad not been brought into play for the simple reason that only\r\nammunition for 9-pounders had been collected in the town,--and seizing a\r\nlarge quantity of stores and ammunition of various kinds.\r\n\r\nThis success gave the enemy the key to the situation.\r\n\r\nAs on sea, so on land, our blundering defensive policy had resulted in\r\nawful disaster. Sufficient attention had never been paid to detail, and\r\nthe firm-rooted idea that Britain could never be invaded had caused\r\ncareless indifference to minor matters of vital importance to the\r\nstability of our Empire.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the combined tactics of the enemy and those of our\r\nforces was especially noticeable when the cavalry patrol of the British\r\nflying column was captured on the Cowfield road and the column defeated.\r\nThe commander of the column, a well-known officer, unfortunately, like\r\nmany others, had had very little experience of combined tactics, and\r\nlooked upon cavalry not merely as \"the eyes and ears of an army,\" but as\r\nthe army itself. It was this defect that was disastrous. For many years\r\npast it had never appeared quite clear whether British cavalry were\r\nintended to act _en masse_ in warfare, or simply as scouts or mounted\r\ninfantry, therefore their training had been uncertain. The Home\r\nestablishment of our cavalry was supposed to be about 12,000 men, but\r\nowing to a parsimonious administration only about half that number had\r\nhorses, and in some corps less than a half. Another glaring defect was\r\nthe division of many regiments into detachments stationed in various\r\ntowns, the inevitable result of this being that many such detachments\r\nwere without regimental practice for months, and there were many who had\r\nnot manoeuvred with a force of all arms _for years_!\r\n\r\nArmy organisation proved a miserable failure.\r\n\r\nThe supply of ammunition was totally inadequate, and a disgrace to a\r\nnation which held its head above all others. It was true that depots had\r\nbeen established at various centres, yet with strange oversight no\r\nprovision had been made for the work of ammunition trains.\r\n\r\nOriginally it had been intended that men for this most important duty\r\nshould be found by the Reserves, and that the horses should be those\r\nprivately registered; nevertheless it was found necessary at the very\r\nlast moment to weaken our artillery by detailing experienced men for\r\nduty with the ammunition column. Many of the horses which were\r\nregistered for service were found to be totally unfit, and very few of\r\nthe remainder had been previously trained. In the case of those which\r\nwere required for the cavalry regiments--nearly six thousand--the best\r\nmen in the regiments had to be told off at the very beginning of the\r\ninvasion to hurriedly train and prepare these animals for service, when\r\nthey should have been available to proceed to any part of the kingdom at\r\ntwenty-four hours' notice. By such defects mobilisation was foredoomed\r\nto failure.\r\n\r\nThe scheme, instead of being so arranged as to be carried out without\r\nconfusion, resulted in muddle and farcical humiliation.\r\n\r\nAgain, the infantry, owing to the recent departure of the Indian drafts,\r\nhad been considerably weakened, many battalions being found on\r\nmobilisation very disorganised and inefficient. As an instance, out of\r\none battalion at Aldershot, which was on paper 1000 strong, 200 had been\r\nsent away to India, while of the remainder more than half had only seen\r\ntwelve months' service, and a large percentage were either under\r\neighteen years of age or were \"special enlistments,\" namely, below the\r\nminimum standard of height.\r\n\r\nSuch a battalion compared very unfavourably with the majority of\r\nVolunteer regiments,--those of the Stafford Brigade, for instance,--the\r\naverage service of the men in those regiments being over five years, and\r\nthe average age twenty-seven years. British officers had long ago\r\nforeseen all these defects, and many others, yet they had preserved an\r\nenforced silence. They themselves were very inefficiently trained in\r\nmanoeuvring, for, with one or two exceptions, there were no stations in\r\nthe kingdom where forces were sufficiently numerous to give the majority\r\nof the superior officers practice in handling combined bodies of troops.\r\n\r\nThus in practical experience in the field they were far behind both\r\nFrench and Russians, and it was this very serious deficiency that now\r\nbecame everywhere apparent.\r\n\r\nBritish troops, fighting valiantly, struggled to protect their native\r\nland, which they determined should never fall under the thrall of the\r\ninvader. But alas! their resistance, though stubborn and formidable, was\r\nnevertheless futile. Time after time the lines of defence were broken.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Eagle spread his black wings to the sun, and with joyous\r\nshouts the dense grey white masses of the enemy marched on over the\r\ndusty Sussex roads northward towards the Thames.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Horsham, the gigantic right column of the invaders,\r\nconsisting mostly of French troops, followed up the defenders to\r\nGuildford and Dorking, preparatory to an attack upon London; while the\r\nleft column, numbering 150,000 French and Russians of all arms, pushed\r\non through Alfold to Haslemere, then through Farnham and Odiham to\r\nSwallowfield, all of which towns they sacked and burned, the terrified\r\ninhabitants being treated with scant mercy. As the majority of the\r\ndefenders were massed in Kent, South Surrey, and Sussex, the enemy\r\nadvanced practically unmolested, and at sunrise one morning a terrible\r\npanic was created in Reading by the sudden descent upon the town of a\r\ngreat advance guard of 10,000 Russians.\r\n\r\nThe people were appalled. They could offer no resistance against the\r\ncavalry, who, tearing along the straight high road from Swallowfield,\r\nswept down upon them. Along this road the whole gigantic force was\r\nmoving, and the Cossack skirmishers, spurring on across the town, passed\r\naway through the Railway Works, and halted at the bridge that spans the\r\nThames at Caversham. They occupied it at once, in order to prevent it\r\nbeing blown up before the main body arrived, and a brisk fight ensued\r\nwith the small body of defenders that had still remained at the Brigade\r\ndepot on the Purley Road.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as the French and Russian advance guard came along, they\r\ndevastated the land with fire and sword. The farms along the road were\r\nsearched, and afterwards set on fire, while not a house at Three Mile\r\nCross escaped. Entering the town from Whitley Hill, the great mass of\r\ntroops, working in extended order, came slowly on, and, followed by\r\n140,000 of the main body and 1000 guns, carried everything before them.\r\n\r\nNo power could stem the advancing tide of the Muscovite legions, and as\r\nthey poured into the town in dense compact bodies, hundreds of\r\ntownspeople were shot down ruthlessly, merely because they attempted to\r\ndefend their homes. From the Avenue Works away to the Cemetery, and from\r\nthe Railway Station to Leighton Park, the streets swarmed with soldiers\r\nof the Tsar, who entered almost every house in search of plunder, and\r\nfired out of sheer delight in bloodshed upon hundreds who were flying\r\nfor their lives.\r\n\r\nMen, women, even children, were slaughtered. The massacre was\r\nfrightful. Neither life nor property was respected; in every\r\nthoroughfare brutal outrages and murders were committed, and English\r\nhomes were rendered desolate.\r\n\r\nAlmost the first buildings attacked were the great factories of Messrs.\r\nHuntley & Palmer, whose 3000 hands were now, alas! idle owing to the\r\nfamine. The stores were searched for biscuits, and afterwards the whole\r\nfactory was promptly set on fire. The Great Western, Queen's, and George\r\nHotels were searched from garret to cellar, and the wines and beer found\r\nin the latter were drunk in the streets. With the scant provisions\r\nfound, several of the regiments made merry during the morning, while\r\nothers pursued their devastating work. The banks were looted, St.\r\nMary's, Greyfriars', and St. Lawrence's Churches were burned, and Sutton\r\n& Sons' buildings and the Railway Works shared the same fate, while out\r\nin the direction of Prospect Hill Park all the houses were sacked, and\r\nthose occupants who remained to guard their household treasures were put\r\nto the sword.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the invaders displayed the most fiendish brutality, and the\r\nsmall force of British troops who had engaged the Russian advance guard\r\nwere, after a most fiercely contested struggle, completely annihilated,\r\nnot, however, before they had successfully placed charges of gun-cotton\r\nunder the bridge and blown it up, together with a number of Cossacks who\r\nhad taken possession of it.\r\n\r\nThis, however, only checked the enemy's progress temporarily, for the\r\nright flank crossed at Sonning, and as the main body had with them\r\nseveral pontoon sections, by noon the pontoons were in position, and the\r\nlong line of cavalry, infantry, artillery, and engineers, leaving behind\r\nReading, now in flames, crossed the Thames and wound away along the road\r\nto Banbury, which quaint old town, immortalised in nursery rhyme, they\r\nsacked and burned, destroying the historic Cross, and regaling\r\nthemselves upon the ale found in the cellars of the inns, the Red and\r\nWhite Lions. This done, they again continued their march, practically\r\nunmolested; while Oxford was also entered and sacked.\r\n\r\nTrue, scouts reported strong forces of the defenders advancing across\r\nfrom Market Harborough, Kettering, and Oundle, and once or twice British\r\noutposts had sharp encounters with the Russians along the hills between\r\nLadbrooke and Daventry, resulting in serious losses on both sides;\r\nnevertheless the gigantic force of Russians still proceeded, sweeping\r\naway every obstacle from their path.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Banbury, the enemy, marching in column of route, took the\r\nroad through Stratford-on-Avon to Wootton Wawen, where a halt for\r\ntwenty-four hours was made in order to mature plans for an organised\r\nattack on Birmingham. Wootton Hall, after being looted, was made the\r\nheadquarters, and from thence was issued an order on the following day\r\nwhich caused Warwick and Leamington to be swept and burned by the\r\ninvaders, who afterwards broke into two divisions. One body, consisting\r\nof 50,000 men, including an advance guard of 5000, took the right-hand\r\nroad from Wootton to Birmingham, through Sparkbrook; while the remaining\r\n100,000 bore away to the left through Ullenhall and Holt End to the\r\nextremity of the Hagley Hills, intending to occupy them. They had\r\nalready been informed that strong defences had been established at\r\nKing's Norton, in the immediate vicinity, and knew that severe fighting\r\nmust inevitably ensue; therefore they lost no time in establishing\r\nthemselves along the high ground between Redditch and Barnt Green, in a\r\nposition commanding the two main roads south from Dudley and Birmingham.\r\n\r\nThat a most desperate stand would be made for the defence of the\r\nMetropolis of the Midlands the Russian commander was well aware. After\r\nthe long march his troops were jaded, so, bivouacing in Hewell Park, he\r\nawaited for nearly two days the reports of his spies. These were not so\r\nreassuring as he had anticipated, for it appeared that the high ground\r\nsouth of the city, notably at King's Norton, Northfield, Harborne,\r\nEdgbaston, and along the Hagley Road, was occupied by strong bodies of\r\ntroops and a large number of guns, and that every preparation had been\r\nmade for a stubborn resistance.\r\n\r\nIt also appeared that at the entrance to the city at Sparkbrook, which\r\nroad had been taken by the right column, very little resistance was\r\nlikely to be offered.\r\n\r\nThat the positions occupied by the defenders had been very carefully\r\nchosen as the most advantageous the Russian commander was bound to\r\nadmit, and although he possessed such a large body of men it would\r\nrequire considerable tactical skill to dislodge the defenders in order\r\nto prevent them covering with their guns the country over which the\r\nRussian division, taking the right-hand roads, must travel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATTLEFIELD OF BIRMINGHAM.]\r\n\r\nDuring that day an encounter of a most fierce description occurred\r\nbetween hostile reconnoitring parties on the road between Bromsgrove\r\nLickey and Northfield. The road gradually ascended with a walled-in\r\nplantation on either side, and the enemy were proceeding at a\r\ncomfortable pace when suddenly a number of rifles rattled out\r\nsimultaneously, and then it was discovered that the wall had been\r\nloopholed, and that the British were pouring upon them a deadly hail\r\nfrom which there was no shelter. The walls bristled with rifles, and\r\nfrom them came a storm of bullets that killed and wounded dozens of the\r\ninvaders.\r\n\r\nThe latter, however, showed considerable daring, for while the magazine\r\nrifles poured forth their deadly shower, they rallied and charged up the\r\nhill in the face of the fearful odds against them. For ten minutes or\r\nperhaps a quarter of an hour the fighting was a desperate hand-to-hand\r\none, the enemy entering the plantation with a dash that surprised the\r\ndefenders. Gradually, although outnumbered by the Russians, the British\r\nat length, by dint of the most strenuous effort and hard fighting,\r\nsucceeded in inflicting frightful loss upon the invaders, and the\r\nlatter, after a most desperate stand, eventually retreated in confusion\r\ndown into the valley, leaving nearly two-thirds of the party dead or\r\ndying.\r\n\r\nThe British, whose losses were very small, had shown the invaders that\r\nthey meant to defend Birmingham, and that every inch of ground they\r\ngained would have to be won by sheer fighting. An hour later another\r\nfierce encounter occurred in the same neighbourhood, and of the 4000\r\nRussians who had advanced along that road not 900 returned to the main\r\nbody, such havoc the British Maxims caused; while at the same time a\r\nfurther disaster occurred to the enemy in another direction, for away at\r\nTanworth their outposts had been completely annihilated, those who were\r\nnot killed being taken prisoners by the 3rd South Staffordshire\r\nVolunteers, who, under Colonel E. Nayler, acted with conspicuous\r\nbravery. In every direction the enemy's outposts and advance guards were\r\nbeing harassed, cut up, and hurled back in disorder with heavy loss,\r\ntherefore the Russian commander decided that a sudden and rapid movement\r\nforward in order to effect a junction with his right column was the only\r\nmeans by which the position could be carried.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime events were occurring rapidly all over the country south\r\nof the city. The commander of the Russian left column, deciding to\r\ncommence the attack forthwith, moved on his forces just before midnight\r\nin order to commence the onslaught before daybreak, knowing the British\r\nforces always relieve their outposts at that time. Again, it was\r\nnecessary to advance under cover of darkness in order to prevent the\r\ndefenders' artillery, which now commanded the road between Alcester and\r\nMoseley, firing upon them.\r\n\r\nHaving received a message from the right column stating that their\r\nadvance guard had pushed on to Olton End with outposts at Sheldon and\r\nYardley, and announcing their intention of advancing through Sparkbrook\r\nupon the city before dawn, the commanding officer, leaving some\r\nartillery at Barnt Green, and sending on cavalry to Stourbridge and\r\nCradley to turn the English flank at Halesowen, manoeuvred rapidly,\r\nbringing the main body of cavalry and infantry back to Alvechurch,\r\nthence across to Weatheroak, and then striking due north, again marched\r\nby the three roads leading to King's Norton.\r\n\r\nThe high ground here he knew was strongly defended, and it was about a\r\nquarter to two o'clock when the British, by means of their\r\nsearch-lights, discovered the great dark masses advancing upon them.\r\nQuickly their guns opened fire, and the sullen booming of cannon was\r\nanswered by the Russian battery near Barnt Green. Over Birmingham the\r\nnoise was heard, and had volumes of terrible significance for the\r\nturbulent crowds who filled the broad thoroughfares. The search-lights\r\nused by both invaders and defenders turned night into day, and the\r\nbattle proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had carefully prepared their plans, for almost at the same\r\nmoment that they assaulted the position at King's Norton, a battery of\r\nRussian artillery opened a terrible fire from the hill at Tanner's\r\nGreen, while the attacking column extended their right across to\r\nColebrook Hall, with intent to push across to Moseley Station, and thus\r\ngain the top of the ridge of the ground in the rear of the British\r\npositions, and so hem in the British force and allow the right column to\r\nadvance through Small Heath and Sparkbrook unchecked.\r\n\r\nThese simultaneous attacks met in the valley separating the parallel\r\nridges held by the Russians and British, and the fighting became at once\r\nfierce and stubborn. A furious infantry fire raged for over an hour in\r\nthe valley between the excellent position held by the defenders at\r\nKing's Norton and the lower wooded ridge occupied by the Russians, who\r\nhad succeeded in capturing half a British battery who held it. Owing to\r\nthe bareness of the slope, the Russians went down into battle without\r\ncover, cut up terribly by the British infantry fire, and by the shell\r\nfire from the King's Norton batteries. From the British trenches between\r\nBroad Meadow and Moundsley Hall a galling fire was poured, and Russian\r\ninfantry fell in hundreds over the undulating fields between the high\r\nroad to Alcester and the Blithe River.\r\n\r\nFrom a ridge on the Stratford Road, near Monkspath Street, heavy Russian\r\nartillery opened fire just before dawn, and played terrible havoc with\r\nthe British guns, which on the sky-line opposite afforded a mark. As\r\ntime crept on there was no cessation in the thunder on either side,\r\nwhile away along the valleys a most bloody encounter was in progress.\r\nThe whole stretch of country was one huge battlefield. British and\r\nRussians fell in hundreds, nay, in thousands.\r\n\r\nThe losses on every side were appalling; the fortune of war trembled in\r\nthe balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nFALL OF BIRMINGHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe battle outside Birmingham was long, fierce, and furious. No more\r\ndesperately contested engagement had ever occurred in the history of the\r\nBritish Empire. From the very first moment of the fight it was apparent\r\nthat the struggle would be a fearful one, both sides possessing\r\nadvantages; the British by reason of the magnificent defensive positions\r\nthey occupied, and the Russians by reason of their overwhelming numbers.\r\nAgainst a defending force of 50,000 of all arms, 150,000 invaders--the\r\nmajority of whom were Russians--were now fighting, and the combat was\r\nnecessarily long and deadly. British Volunteers were conspicuous\r\neverywhere by their bravery; the Canadians rendered most valuable\r\nassistance, firing from time to time with excellent precision, and\r\nholding their position with splendid courage; while the Irish Brigade,\r\nwho had moved rapidly from King's Cliffe by train and road, and had\r\narrived in time, now held their own in a position close to Kingsheath\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nMany of the principal buildings in Birmingham had during the past day or\r\ntwo been converted into hospitals, amongst others the Post Office, where\r\nthe trained nurses received very valuable assistance from the female\r\nclerks. A train full of British wounded was captured early in the\r\nevening at Barnt Green. It contained regular troops and civilians from\r\nthe Stratford force which had fallen back to Alcester, and the train\r\nhad been sent on from there in the hope that it would get through before\r\nthe enemy were able to cut the line. This, however, was not\r\naccomplished, for the Russians inhumanely turned out the wounded and\r\nfilled the train with their own troops and ammunition. Then, under the\r\nguidance of a Birmingham railway man of French nationality who had been\r\nacting as spy, the train proceeded to New Street Station. It was\r\nimpossible for the officials at the station to cope with the enemy, for\r\nthey had only expected their own wounded, or they would, of course, have\r\nwrecked the train by altering the points before it arrived in the\r\nstation. The Russians therefore detrained, and, led by their spy, made a\r\ndash along the subway leading to the lifts ascending to the Post Office.\r\nThese were secured, and the Office was soon captured by the Russians,\r\nwho not only thereby obtained a footing in the very centre of the town\r\nfrom which there was not much chance of dislodging them before\r\nBirmingham fell, but they had also obtained possession of the most\r\nimportant telegraph centre for the North and Midland districts of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nBefore the first flush of dawn the whole of the country from Kings\r\nNorton right across to Solihull was one huge battlefield, and when the\r\nsun rose, bright and glorious, its rays were obscured by the clouds of\r\nsmoke which hung like a funeral pall over hill and dale. For a long\r\nperiod the principal Russian battery on the Stratford Road was short of\r\nammunition, and, seeing this, the strong British battery at Northfield\r\nmoved quickly up into a commanding position at Drake's Cross, not,\r\nhowever, before it had been considerably weakened by the Russian fire\r\nfrom Bromsgrove Lickey. During this time, however, detachments of\r\nCanadian marksmen had been detailed with no other purpose than to sweep\r\nthe Russian road at the exposed points of its course, and to fire at\r\neverything and everybody exposed on the ridge. This was most effective,\r\nand for quite half an hour prevented any supply of ammunition reaching\r\nthe enemy, thus giving the British battery an opportunity to establish\r\nitself. At length, however, both batteries of defenders opened fire\r\nsimultaneously upon the Russian guns, and so thickly fell the shots,\r\nthat although ammunition had by this time been brought up, the enemy's\r\npower in that quarter was completely broken.\r\n\r\nFrom that time the fierce struggle was confined to cavalry and infantry.\r\nTroops of Cossacks, sweeping up the banks of the Arrow, encountered\r\nBritish Hussars and cut into them with frightful effect. The defenders,\r\nfighting hard as the day wore on, hindered the enemy from gaining any\r\nmaterial advantage, though the latter forced the outer line of the\r\nBritish shelter trenches on the slopes below the position of King's\r\nNorton. The Canadians had laid mines in front of their trenches, which\r\nwere exploded just as the head of the Russian assaulting parties were\r\nmassed above them, and large numbers of the Tsar's infantry were blown\r\ninto atoms.\r\n\r\nBullets were singing along the valleys like swarms of angry wasps, and\r\nthe Russian losses in every direction were enormous.\r\n\r\nHour after hour the fighting continued. The British held good positions,\r\nwith an inner line of defence across from Selly Oak, Harborne, and\r\nEdgbaston, to the high crest on the Hagley Road, close to the Fountain,\r\nwhile the Russians swarmed over the country in overwhelming numbers. The\r\nfrightful losses the latter were sustaining by reason of the defenders'\r\nartillery fire did not, however, disconcert them. But for the huge right\r\ncolumn of invaders advancing on Birmingham by way of Acock's Green, it\r\nseemed an even match, yet as afternoon passed the firing in the valley\r\nswelled in volume, and the mad clamour of battle still surged up into\r\nthe blue cloudless heavens.\r\n\r\nThe enemy could see on the sky-line the British reinforcements as they\r\ncame up from Halesowen by the road close to their battery on the bare\r\nspot near the edge of their right flank, and it was decided at four\r\no'clock to deliver a counter flank attack on the left edge of the\r\nBritish position, simultaneously with a renewed strenuous assault by the\r\ntirailleurs from below. Soon this desperate manoeuvre was commenced, and\r\nalthough the marching ground was good, the British guns swept them with\r\ntheir terrible fire, and hundreds of the Tsar's soldiers dyed the\r\nmeadows with their blood.\r\n\r\nIt was a fierce, mad dash. The British attacked vigorously on every\r\nside, fought bravely, straining every nerve to repulse their foe.\r\n\r\nThe battle had been the most fiercely contested of any during the\r\nstruggle, and in this desperate assault on King's Norton the Russians\r\nhad suffered appalling losses. The valleys and slopes were strewn with\r\ndead and dying, and a bullet had struck the British commander, mortally\r\nwounding him. As he was borne away to the ambulance waggon, the last\r\nwords on that noble soldier's lips were a fervent wish for good fortune\r\nto the arms of the Queen he had served so well.\r\n\r\nBut the British were, alas! outnumbered, and at last retreating in\r\ndisorder, were followed over the hills to Halesowen and utterly routed,\r\nwhile the main body of the enemy marching up the Bristol and Pershore\r\nRoads, extended their left across to Harborne and Edgbaston. Meanwhile,\r\nhowever, the guns placed on the edge of the city along the Hagley Road\r\nnear the Fountain, and in Beech Lane close to the Talbot Inn, as well as\r\nthe Volunteer batteries near St. Augustine's Church and Westfield Road,\r\nopened fire upon the advancing legions. The two lower roads taken by the\r\nenemy were well commanded by the British guns, and the Volunteers, with\r\nthe Canadians and Irish, again rendered most valuable assistance,\r\neverywhere displaying cool and conspicuous courage. The walls of the new\r\nvillas along the Hagley Road, Portland Road, and Beech Lane had been\r\nplaced in a state of hasty defence, and rifles bristled everywhere, but\r\nas the sun sank behind the long range of purple hills the fight was in\r\nthe balance. The British, as they stood, could almost keep back the foe,\r\nbut, alas! not quite.\r\n\r\nThere was soon a concentric rush for the hill, and as the cannons\r\nthundered and rifles rattled, hundreds of the grey-coats fell back and\r\nrolled down the steep slope dead and dying, but the others pushed on in\r\nface of the frowning defences, used their bayonets with desperate\r\nenergy, and a few minutes later loud shouts in Russian told that the\r\nridge had been cleared and the position won. The battle had been long\r\nand terrible; the carnage awful!\r\n\r\nThe British, making a last desperate stand, fought a fierce hand-to-hand\r\nstruggle, but ere long half their number lay helpless in the newly-made\r\nsuburban roads, and the remainder were compelled to leave their guns in\r\npossession of the enemy and fly north to Sandwell to save themselves.\r\nThen, as they fled, the Russians turned the British guns near St.\r\nAugustine's upon them, causing havoc in their rear.\r\n\r\nThe shattered left column of the enemy, having at length broken down the\r\nBritish defences, raised loud victorious yells, and, after reorganising,\r\nmarched down the Hagley Road upon the city, fighting from house to house\r\nthe whole way. The gardens in front of these houses, however, aided the\r\ndefenders greatly in checking the advance.\r\n\r\nThe sacrifice of human life during those hours from daybreak to sundown\r\nhad been frightful. The whole country, from Great Packington to\r\nHalesowen, was strewn with blood-smeared corpses.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the fact that the defending force consisted of only\r\n50,000 men against 100,000 Russians, the losses inflicted upon the\r\nlatter spoke volumes for British pluck and military skill. Upon the\r\nfield 10,000 Russians lay dead, 30,000 were wounded, and 2000 were\r\nprisoners, while the defenders' total loss in killed and wounded only\r\namounted to 20,000.\r\n\r\nIndeed, had it not been for the reinforcements, numbering 50,000, from\r\nthe right column, which were by this time coming up with all speed from\r\nAcock's Green, the Russians, in their terribly jaded and demoralised\r\nstate, could not have marched upon the city. As it was, however, the\r\noccupation commenced as night drew on; the fighting that followed being\r\nprincipally done by the reinforcements.\r\n\r\nLeaving no fewer than 42,000 men dead, wounded, and captured, the\r\ninvaders pushed on into Birmingham. Though the citizens' losses had\r\nalready been terrific, nevertheless they found that they were still\r\ndetermined to hold out. In all the principal roads leading into the\r\ncity barricades had been formed, and behind them were bands of desperate\r\nmen, well equipped, and prepared to fight on to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nThe first of these in the Hagley Road had been constructed at the\r\njunction of Monument Road, and as the skirmishers and advance guard\r\napproached, offered a most desperate resistance. In addition to a\r\nvigorous rifle fire that poured from the improvised defences, three\r\nMaxims were brought into play from the roofs of large houses, and these,\r\ncommanding the whole road as far as its junction with Beech Lane,\r\nliterally mowed down the enemy as they approached. Time after time the\r\nRussians rushed upon the defenders' position, only to be hurled back\r\nagain by the leaden hail, which fell so thickly that it was impossible\r\nfor any body of troops to withstand it. By this the invaders' advance\r\nwas temporarily checked, but it was not long before they established a\r\nbattery at the corner of Norfolk Road, and poured shell upon the\r\nbarricade with frightful effect. Quickly the guns were silenced, and the\r\nRussians at last breaking down the barrier, engaged in a conflict at\r\nclose quarters with the defenders.\r\n\r\nThe road along to Five Ways was desperately contested. The slaughter on\r\nboth sides was awful, for a detachment of Russians coming up the\r\nHarborne Road had been utterly annihilated and swept away by the rifle\r\nfire of defenders concealed behind loopholed walls. At Five Ways the\r\nentrance to each of the five broad converging thoroughfares had been\r\nstrongly barricaded, and as the enemy pressed forward the British\r\nmachine guns established there caused terrible havoc. Behind those\r\nbarricades men of Birmingham of every class, armed with all sorts of\r\nguns, hastily obtained from Kynoch's and other factories, struggled for\r\nthe defence of their homes and loved ones, working with a dash and\r\nenergy that greatly disconcerted the enemy, who had imagined that, in\r\nview of their victory in the battle, little resistance would be offered.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness that had now fallen the scenes in the streets were\r\nfrightful. The only light was the flash from gun-muzzles and the glare\r\nof flames consuming private houses and public buildings. The civilian\r\ndefenders, reinforced by Regular soldiers, Militia, and Volunteers, had\r\nmade such excellent preparations for defence, and offered such strenuous\r\nopposition, that almost every foot the Russians gained in the direction\r\nof the centre of the city was fought for hand to hand. Both right and\r\nleft Russian columns were now advancing up the Coventry, Stratford,\r\nMoseley, Pershore, and Bristol Roads, and in each of those thoroughfares\r\nthe barricades were strongly constructed, and, being armed with Maxims,\r\nwrought frightful execution.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, one after another of these defences fell by reason\r\nof the organised attacks by such superior numbers, and the Russians\r\nmarched on, killing with bayonet and sword.\r\n\r\nIn the city, as the night passed, the fighting in the streets everywhere\r\nwas of the fiercest and most sanguinary description. In Corporation\r\nStreet a huge barricade with machine guns had been constructed opposite\r\nthe Victoria Law Courts, and, assisted by 200 Volunteers, who, inside\r\nthe latter building, fired from the windows, the enemy were held in\r\ncheck for several hours.\r\n\r\nTime after time shells fell from the Russian guns in the midst of the\r\ndefenders, and, bursting, decimated them in a horrible manner; yet\r\nthrough the long close night there was never a lack of brave men to step\r\ninto the breach and take up the arms of their dead comrades. Indeed, it\r\nwas only when the enemy succeeded in setting fire to the Courts, and\r\ncompelling the defenders to cease their vigorous rifle fire from the\r\nwindows, that the position was won; and not until hundreds of Russians\r\nlay dead or dying in the street.\r\n\r\nIn New Street the Irish Volunteers distinguished themselves\r\nconspicuously. After the retreat they had been withdrawn with the\r\nCanadians into the city, and, waiting in the side thoroughfares at the\r\nopposite end of New Street, held themselves in readiness. Suddenly, as\r\nthe enemy rushed along in their direction, an order was given, and they\r\nformed up, and stretching across the street, met them with volley after\r\nvolley of steady firing; then, rushing onward with fixed bayonets,\r\ncharged almost before the Russians were aware of their presence.\r\n\r\nWithout a thought of his own personal safety, every Irishman cast\r\nhimself into the thick of the fray, and, backed by a strong body of\r\nCanadians and fusiliers, they succeeded in cutting their way completely\r\ninto the invaders, and driving them back into Corporation Street, where\r\nthey were forced right under the fire of four Maxims that had just at\r\nthat moment been brought into position outside the Exchange.\r\n\r\nSuddenly these guns rattled out simultaneously, and the Russians, unable\r\nto advance, and standing at the head of the long broad thoroughfare,\r\nwere swept down with awful swiftness and with scarcely any resistance.\r\nSo sudden had been their fate, that of a force over two thousand strong,\r\nnot more than a dozen escaped, although the defenders were taken in rear\r\nby the force of 500 Russians who had occupied the Post Office on the\r\nprevious night.\r\n\r\nFrom Corporation Street a brilliant, ruddy glow suffused the sky, as\r\nboth the Law Courts and the Grand Theatre were in flames, while St.\r\nMary's Church and the Market Hall had also been fired by incendiaries.\r\n\r\nIn the panic and confusion, conflagrations were breaking out everywhere,\r\nflames bursting forth from several fine shops in New Street which had\r\nalready been sacked and wrecked. Maddened by their success, by the\r\nthirst for the blood of their enemies, and the rash deeds of\r\nincendiaries, the Muscovite legions spread over the whole city, and\r\noutrage and murder were common everywhere.\r\n\r\nAway up Great Hampton Street and Hockley Hill the jewellery factories\r\nwere looted, and hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of gems and gold\r\nwere carried off, while the Mint was entered, afterwards being burned\r\nbecause only copper coins were found there, and the pictures in the Art\r\nGallery were wantonly slashed by sabres and bayonets.\r\n\r\nThe scenes on that memorable night were awful. Birmingham, one of the\r\nmost wealthy cities in the kingdom, fell at last, after a most stubborn\r\nresistance, for just before day broke the overwhelming forces of Russia\r\noccupying the streets commenced to drive out the defenders, and shoot\r\ndown those who turned to resist. From Bordesley to Handsworth, and from\r\nSmethwick to Aston, the city was in the hands of the enemy. The banks in\r\nNew Street were broken open, and the gold stuffed into the pockets of\r\nthe uncouth dwellers on the Don and the Volga, Chamberlain's Memorial\r\nwas wrecked, and Queen's College occupied by infantry. Cossack officers\r\nestablished themselves in the Grand and Queen's Hotels, and their men\r\nwere billeted at the Midland, Union, Conservative, and other Clubs, and\r\nat many minor hotels and buildings.\r\n\r\nBefore the dawn had spread, whole rows of shops were burning, their\r\nbrilliant glare illuminating the streets that ran with blood. It was a\r\nfearful scene of death and desolation.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the citizens had fled, leaving everything in the hands\r\nof the enemy, who still continued their work of pillage. In the streets\r\nthe bodies of 10,000 Russians and 3000 British lay unheeded, while no\r\nfewer than 9000 of the enemy's infantry had been wounded.\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the Russian army had at last been established in a\r\nBritish city, for over the great Council House there now lazily flapped\r\nin the fresh morning breeze the great yellow-and-black flag of the Tsar\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nAnd the Russian General, finding he had lost the enormous force of\r\n61,000 men, spent the grey hours of dawn in nervous anxiousness, pacing\r\nthe room in which he had installed himself, contemplating the frightful\r\ndisaster, and undecided how next to act.\r\n\r\nAn incident illustrative of the fierceness of the fight outside the city\r\nwas published in the _Times_ several days later. It was an extract from\r\na private letter written by Lieut. J. G. Morris of the 3rd Battalion of\r\nthe York and Lancaster Regiment, and was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The sun that day was blazing and merciless. Throughout the morning our\r\nbattalion had lost heavily in the valley, when suddenly at about twelve\r\no'clock the enemy apparently received reinforcements, and we were then\r\ndriven back upon Weatheroak by sheer force of numbers, and afterwards\r\nagain fell further back towards our position on the high ground in\r\nHagley Road.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRMINGHAM OCCUPIED BY THE RUSSIANS.]\r\n\r\n\"In this hasty retreat I found myself with a sergeant and eighteen men\r\npursued by a large skirmishing party of Russians. All we could do was to\r\nfly before them. This we did, until at length, turning into Beech Lane,\r\nwe found ourselves before a small, low-built ancient hostelry, the\r\nKing's Head Inn, with a dilapidated and somewhat crude counterfeit\r\npresentment of King George II. outside. The place was unoccupied, and I\r\ndecided immediately to enter it. I could count on every one of my men;\r\ntherefore very soon we were inside, and had barricaded the little place.\r\nScarcely had we accomplished this when the first shots rang out, and in\r\na few moments the space outside where the cross-roads meet literally\r\nswarmed with Russians, who quickly extended, and, seeking cover at the\r\njunction of each of the five roads, commenced a terrific fusillade. The\r\nwindows from which we fired were smashed, the woodwork splintered\r\neverywhere, and so thickly came the bullets that my men had to exercise\r\nthe utmost caution in concealing themselves while firing.\r\n\r\n\"In a quarter of an hour one man had been struck and lay dead by my\r\nside, while at the same time the terrible truth suddenly dawned upon me\r\nthat our ammunition could not last out. Regulating the firing, I rushed\r\nto one of the back windows that commanded the valley down to Harborne,\r\nand saw advancing along the road in our direction, and raising a cloud\r\nof dust, about a thousand Russian cavalry and infantry.\r\n\r\n\"Back again to the front room I dashed, just in time to witness the\r\nenemy make a wild rush towards us. Our slackened fire had deceived them,\r\nand as the storming party dashed forward, they were met by vigorous\r\nvolleys from our magazine rifles, which knocked over dozens, and\r\ncompelled the remainder to again retire.\r\n\r\n\"Again the enemy made a desperate onslaught, and again we succeeded in\r\nhurling them back, and stretching dead a dozen or more. Meanwhile the\r\ngreat force of Russians was moving slowly up the hill, and I knew that\r\nto hold the place much longer would be impossible. From the rear of the\r\nbuilding a vigorous attack had now commenced, and moving more men round\r\nto the rear, so that our fire would command the sloping approach to the\r\nhouse, I gave an order to fire steadily. A moment later my sergeant and\r\ntwo other men had been severely wounded, and although the former had had\r\nhis arm broken, and was near fainting from loss of blood, nevertheless\r\nhe kept up, resting his rifle-barrel upon the shattered window-ledge,\r\nand pouring out the deadly contents of his magazine.\r\n\r\n\"A few minutes afterwards a bullet shattered my left hand, and the man\r\nwho crouched next to me under the window was a second later shot through\r\nthe heart, and fell back dead among the disordered furniture.\r\n\r\n\"Still not a man hesitated, not a word of despair was uttered. We all\r\nknew that death stared us in the face, and that to face it bravely was a\r\nBriton's duty. Only once I shouted above the din: 'Do your best, boys!\r\nRemember we we are all Britons, and those vermin outside have wrecked\r\nour homes and killed those we love. Let's have our revenge, even if we\r\ndie for it!'\r\n\r\n\"'We'll stick to 'em till the very last, sir, never fear,' cheerily\r\nreplied one young fellow as he reloaded his gun; but alas! ere he could\r\nraise it to fire, a bullet struck him in the throat. He staggered back,\r\nand a few moments later was a corpse.\r\n\r\n\"Undaunted, however, my men determined to sell their lives as dearly as\r\npossible, and continued their fire, time after time repelling the\r\nattack, and sweeping away the grey-coats as they emerged from behind the\r\nlow walls.\r\n\r\n\"Three more men had fallen in as many seconds, and another, staggering\r\nback against the wall, held his hand to his breast, where he had\r\nreceived a terrible and mortal wound. Our situation at that moment was\r\nmost critical. Only two rounds remained to each of my nine brave\r\nfellows, yet not a man wavered.\r\n\r\n\"Looking, I saw in the fading twilight the dark masses of the enemy\r\nmoving up the steep road, and at that moment a round was fired with\r\neffect upon those who had surrounded us. One more round only remained.\r\nThen we meant to die fighting. Blinding smoke suddenly filled the\r\nhalf-wrecked room, and we knew that the enemy had succeeded in setting\r\nfire to the taproom underneath!\r\n\r\n\"I stepped forward, and shouted for the last time the order to my brave\r\ncomrades to fire. Nine rifles rang out simultaneously; but I had, I\r\nsuppose, showed myself imprudently, for at the same second I felt a\r\nsharp twinge in the shoulder, and knew that I had been struck. The rest\r\nwas all a blank.\r\n\r\n\"When I regained my senses I found myself lying in Sandwell Hall, with\r\ndoctors bandaging my wounds, and then I learned that we had been rescued\r\njust in time, and that my nine comrades had all escaped the fate they\r\nhad faced with dogged disregard for their own safety, and such noble\r\ndevotion to their Queen.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a black day for Britain. During the long hours of that fierce,\r\nmad struggle many Victoria Crosses were earned, but the majority of\r\nthose who performed deeds worthy of such decoration, alas! fell to the\r\nearth, dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nOUR REVENGE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany important events had occurred in the Mediterranean since the\r\noutbreak of hostilities. At the moment of the sudden Declaration of War,\r\nthe ships forming the British Mediterranean Squadron were at Larnaka,\r\nCyprus, and on receipt of the alarming intelligence, the Admiral sailed\r\nimmediately for Malta. On arrival there, he heard that a strong force of\r\nFrench vessels had been despatched to Gibraltar for the purpose of\r\npreventing any British ships from getting out of the Mediterranean in\r\norder to strengthen the Channel Squadron. Nevertheless he waited for\r\nsome days at Malta, in hourly expectation of instructions, which came at\r\nlength about two o'clock one morning, and an hour later the Squadron\r\nsailed westward for an unknown destination.\r\n\r\nOur Fleet in those waters was notoriously inadequate in comparison with\r\nthose of France and Russia. It consisted of three of the battleships\r\nconstructed under the 1894 programme, the _Jupiter_, _Caesar_, and\r\n_Victorious_, with the cruisers _Diana_ and _Dido_; the ironclads\r\n_Collingwood_, _Dreadnought_, _Hood_, _Inflexible_, _Nile_, _Ramillies_,\r\n_Repulse_, _Sans Pareil_, _Trafalgar_, _Magnificent_, _Empress of\r\nIndia_, and _Revenge_; the cruisers _Arethusa_, _Edgar_, _Fearless_,\r\n_Hawke_, _Scout_, _Orlando_, _Undaunted_; the torpedo ram _Polyphemus_;\r\nthe torpedo gun-vessel _Sandfly_; the sloops _Dolphin_, _Gannet_,\r\n_Melita_, and _Bramble_; and the despatch vessel _Surprise_, with\r\ntwenty-two torpedo boats and six destroyers.\r\n\r\nThe information received by our Fleet at Malta was to the effect that\r\nthe French force at Gibraltar was so strong that a successful attack was\r\nout of the question; while the Russian Mediterranean and Black Sea\r\nFleets, the strength of which was considerable, were also known to be\r\napproaching for the purpose of co-operating with the French.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the addition of three new battleships and two new\r\ncruisers to our force in the Mediterranean, the utter inadequacy of our\r\nNavy was still very apparent. For years the British public had demanded\r\nthat a dozen more new battleships should be constructed in case of\r\ncasualties, but these demands were unheeded, and during the three years\r\nthat had passed we had lost our naval supremacy, for France and Russia\r\ncombined were now considerably stronger. France alone had 150 fighting\r\npennants available along her southern shores, against our 59; and the\r\nTsar's ships were all strong, well-equipped, and armed with guns of the\r\nlatest type.\r\n\r\nAs was feared from the outset, the Russian Black Sea Fleet had struck\r\nfor the Suez Canal, England's highway to the East. Egypt, the Bosphorus,\r\nGibraltar, and Tripoli in the grasp of the enemy, meant supremacy in the\r\nEast, and a situation that would not be tolerated by either Italy or\r\nAustria. Therefore the British Admiral, recognising the seriousness of\r\nthe situation, and having received instructions to return home and\r\nassist in the defence of Britain, mustered his forces and cleared for\r\naction. The events that occurred immediately afterwards are best related\r\nin the graphic and interesting narrative which was subsequently written\r\nto a friend by Captain Neville Reed of the great steel battleship\r\n_Ramillies_, and afterwards published, together with the accompanying\r\nsketch, in the _Illustrated London News_, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"After leaving Malta, we rounded the Adventure Bank off the Sicilian\r\ncoast, and headed due north past Elba and on to the Gulf of Genoa.\r\nFrom Spezia we received despatches, and after anchoring for\r\ntwelve hours,--during which time we were busy completing our\r\npreparations,--sailed at midnight westward. Off St. Tropez, near the\r\nHyeres Islands, in obedience to signals from the flagship, the _Empress\r\nof India_, the ironclads _Jupiter_, _Sans Pareil_, _Repulse_, with the\r\ncruisers _Edgar_, _Dido_, _Diana_, _Orlando_, _Undaunted_, and _Scout_,\r\nthe sloop _Gannet_, and five torpedo boats, detached themselves from the\r\nSquadron, and after exchanging further signals, bore away due south.\r\nGiving the shore a wide offing, we steamed along throughout the\r\nafternoon. The Mediterranean had not yet been the scene of any bloody or\r\nfatal conflict, but as we cut our way through the calm sunlit waters\r\nwith a brilliant cerulean sky above, the contrast between our bright and\r\nlovely surroundings and the terrible realities of the situation during\r\nthose breathless hours of suspense still dwells distinctly in my memory.\r\n\r\n\"It was our duty to fight the enemy, to beat him, and to pass through\r\nthe Straits of Gibraltar and help our comrades at home. Every man,\r\nalthough totally unaware of his present destination, felt that at last\r\nthe moment had come when the supreme ambition of his life was to be\r\nrealised, and he was to strike a blow for his country's honour.\r\n\r\n\"Apparently our Admiral was in no hurry. He no doubt was awaiting\r\nevents, for at sunset we lay-to about thirty miles south of La Ciotat,\r\nand spent the calm bright night restlessly anxious and keeping a sharp\r\nlookout for the enemy. There was a hush of expectation over the ship,\r\nand scarcely a sound broke the quiet save the lapping of the water\r\nagainst the smooth sides of the ironclad, and no sign of force except\r\nthe swish of the waves falling on either side of the formidable and\r\ndeadly ram.\r\n\r\n\"Just after seven bells in the morning watch, however, we resumed our\r\nvoyage, and turning, went north again. Then, for the first time, we knew\r\nthe Admiral's intentions. An ultimatum had already been given. _We were\r\nto bombard Marseilles!_\r\n\r\n\"Three hours later we came within view of the city. Seen from the sea it\r\nhas a certain amount of picturesqueness. In the foreground there is the\r\nharbour, with a barren group of islands at its entrance, and behind\r\nmasses of yellow houses covering an extensive valley, and white villas\r\ndotted over a semicircle of green hills stretching in the rear.\r\nProminent in the landscape is the church of Notre Dame de la Garde,\r\nperched on the eminence on the right; while on the left there stands on\r\nan island the Chateau d'If, rendered immortal by the adventures of Monte\r\nCristo; and behind, on the broad Quai de la Joliette, rises the fine\r\nCathedral, built in alternate courses of black and white stone. It is a\r\nhandsome and wealthy city, with its fine shady boulevard, the Cannebiere\r\nrunning through its centre from the Arc de Triomphe right down to the\r\nold port whence the mail steamers depart. This city, teeming with life,\r\nit was our duty to lay in ruins!\r\n\r\n\"Knowing how strongly fortified it was, that upon each of those hills\r\nwere great batteries ready at a given signal to pour out their deadly\r\nhail, and that under the blue waters were mines which might be exploded\r\nfrom the shore at any moment, we made preparations for counter-mining,\r\nand then cautiously approached within range. Suddenly, however, having\r\ngot into position and laid our guns, we received the anxiously expected\r\norder, and a few moments later opened a terrific and almost simultaneous\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"Through my glass I could clearly distinguish the terrible confusion\r\nbeing caused in the streets as our shells fell and burst on the Quai de\r\nla Joliette, in the Cannebiere, and the Boulevard de l'Empereur.\r\n\r\n\"The first taste of our guns had produced a terrible panic, for a shell\r\nfrom the _Dreadnought_, lying next to us, had struck the tower of the\r\nCathedral and brought down a great quantity of masonry, while another\r\nshell from one of our 67-ton guns, bursting in the Palais de Justice\r\nwith terrible effect, had ignited it.\r\n\r\n\"It was our first shot, and the gun had been well sighted; but ere we\r\nfired again such a storm of shell burst upon us that I confess for a\r\nmoment I stood in my conning-tower motionless in surprise. On all sides\r\nthe French had apparently established batteries. From the great Fort St.\r\nJean at the entrance to the port, and from the Batterie du Phare on the\r\nopposite side, flame and smoke belched from heavy guns continuously.\r\nFrom a small battery in the Chateau d'If, from another on the rocky\r\npromontory on the right known as the Edoume, from a number of smaller\r\nones established on the hills of l'Oriol and the Citadel, as well as\r\nfrom the great fortress of Notre Dame de la Garde on the highest hill, a\r\nlittle to the right of the city, there came an incessant thunder, and\r\ndozens of shots ricochetted over the placid water towards us.\r\n\r\n\"In a few moments, however, my 67-tonners were again adding to the\r\ndeafening roar, my ten 6-inch quick-firing guns were sending out their\r\nmessengers of death, and my smaller arms, consisting of 3 and\r\n16-pounders, were acting their part in the sudden outburst. We had\r\nattacked the town without intention of investment, but simply to destroy\r\nit, and as the minutes slipped by, and I peered through my glass, I\r\ncould see how devastating were our enormous modern shells.\r\n\r\n\"All our guns were now trained upon the forts, and the bombardment was\r\nmost vigorous. The six coast-defence ships, which endeavoured to drive\r\nus off, we quickly put out of action, capturing one, torpedoing two, and\r\ndisabling the three others; while up to the present, although a number\r\nof shots from the land batteries had struck us, we sustained no serious\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\n\"We were avenging Hull and Newcastle. Into the panic-stricken town we\r\nwere pouring an unceasing storm of shell, which swept away whole streets\r\nof handsome buildings, and killed hundreds of those flying for safety\r\ninto the country. Watching, I saw one shot from one of my bow barbette\r\nguns crash into the roof of the fine new Hotel du Louvre, in the\r\nCannebiere. The French Tricolor on the flagstaff toppled over into the\r\nstreet, and a second later the clouds of smoke and the debris which shot\r\nup showed plainly the awful results of the bursting shell.\r\n\r\n\"Time after time my 67-tonners crashed and roared, time after time I\r\npressed my fingers upon the little knobs in the conning-tower, and huge\r\nprojectiles were discharged right into the forts. In conjunction with\r\nthe never-ceasing fire of companion ships, we rained iron in a\r\ncontinuous stream that wrought havoc in the defences and destroyed all\r\nthe buildings that offered targets. In an hour the Arsenal behind the\r\nPalais de Justice was laid in ruins, the fine Hotel de Ville was a mere\r\nheap of smouldering debris, the Bourse, and the great Library in the\r\nBoulevard du Musee were half wrecked by shells, and the Custom House,\r\nthe Gendarmerie, and the Prefecture were burning furiously. The Chateau\r\ndu Phare on the headland at the entrance to the fort was suffering\r\nfrightfully, and the shells that had struck the Citadel and the fort of\r\nNotre Dame had been terribly effective. Every part of the city from the\r\nPromenade du Prado to the Botanical Gardens was being swept continuously\r\nby our fire, and from the black smoke curling upward in the sunlight we\r\nknew that many broad handsome streets were in flames. Excited over their\r\nwork of revenge, my guns' crews worked on with a contemptuous disregard\r\nfor the withering fire being poured upon us from the land. They meant,\r\nthey said, to teach the Frenchmen a lesson, and they certainly did.\r\nAround us shots from the batteries fell thickly, sending up huge columns\r\nof water. Suddenly a shell struck the _Ramillies_ forward in front of\r\nthe barbette, and burst like the rending of a thundercloud. The deck was\r\ntorn up, a dozen men were maimed or killed, poor fellows! but the solid\r\nface of the barbette held its own, and the muzzles of our two great guns\r\nremained untouched.\r\n\r\n\"Several shots from the Notre Dame Fort and the Endoume Battery then\r\nstruck us in quick succession. One was particularly disastrous, for,\r\ncrashing into the battery on the port side, it burst, disabling one of\r\nthe 6-inch guns, and killing the whole gun's crew in an instant. The\r\neffect was frightful, for the whole space around was wrecked, and not a\r\nman escaped.\r\n\r\n\"Such are the fortunes of war! A few moments later we turned our heavy\r\nguns upon the Endoume Battery, perched up upon the rocky headland, and\r\ntogether with the _Empress of India_ and the _Victorious_ thundered\r\nforth our great projectiles upon it in a manner which must have been\r\nterribly disconcerting. The battery replied vigorously at first, but the\r\n_Nile_, noticing the direction in which we had turned our attention,\r\ntrained her guns upon the same fort, and let loose a perfect hail of\r\ndevastating shell. Without ceasing for a second, we played upon it, and\r\ncould distinguish even with the naked eye how completely we were\r\ndestroying it, until half an hour later we found that the Frenchmen had\r\nceased to reply. We had silenced their guns, and, in fact, totally\r\nwrecked the fort.\r\n\r\n\"Several of our vessels were, however, severely feeling the fire from\r\nthe Notre Dame Fortress and that of St. Jean. Nearly one hundred men on\r\nboard the _Trafalgar_ had been killed; while two shots, entering one of\r\nthe broadside batteries of the flagship, had caused frightful havoc, and\r\nhad blown to atoms over forty men and three officers. A torpedo boat\r\nthat had approached the French coast-defence ship just before she was\r\ncaptured had been sunk by a shot, but the crew were fortunately all\r\nrescued, after much difficulty, by the sloop _Dolphin_, which had\r\nseverely suffered herself from the vigorous fire from the Batterie du\r\nPhare. The funnel of the _Nile_ had been carried away by a shot from the\r\nCitadel, while among the more conspicuous British losses was a serious\r\ncatastrophe which had occurred on board the _Hood_ by the premature\r\nexplosion of a torpedo, by which a sub-lieutenant and thirty-three men\r\nwere launched into eternity, and sixteen men very severely wounded. The\r\nengines of the _Arethusa_ were also broken.\r\n\r\n\"The smoke rising from the bombarded city increased every moment in\r\ndensity, and even in the daylight we could distinguish the flames. The\r\ncentre of Marseilles was burning furiously, and the fire was now\r\nspreading unchecked. One of our objects had been to destroy the immense\r\nquantity of war stores, and in this we were entirely successful. We had\r\nturned our united efforts upon the Fort St. Jean down at the harbour\r\nentrance and that of Notre Dame high on the hill. Pounding away at\r\nthese, time slipped by until the sun sank in a blaze of crimson and\r\ngold. Both forts made a gallant defence, but each of our shots went\r\nhome, and through my glasses I watched the awful result. Suddenly a\r\nterrific report caused the whole city to tremble. One of our shots had\r\napparently entered the powder magazine in the Fort St. Jean, and it had\r\nblown up, producing an appalling catastrophe from which the fortress\r\ncould never recover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOMBARDMENT OF MARSEILLES BY THE BRITISH:\r\n\"ONE OF OUR SHELLS HAD ENTERED THE POWDER MAGAZINE OF FORT ST. JEAN.\"]\r\n\r\n\"By this time the whole of the shipping in the docks was burning\r\nfuriously, and the congested part of the city lying between the port and\r\nthe Lyons Railway Station was like a huge furnace. The sight was one of\r\nterrible grandeur.\r\n\r\n\"Presently, just as the sun sank behind the grey night clouds, we ceased\r\nfire, and then gazed with calm satisfaction upon the result of our\r\nbombardment. We had treated a French city in the same manner as the\r\nFrench and Russians had treated our own homes, and we could look upon\r\nthis scene of destruction and death without a pang of remorse. But that\r\nwas not all. When our guns were silent we could distinctly hear vigorous\r\nrifle firing at the back of the city. Then we knew the truth.\r\n\r\n\"While we had been attacking Marseilles from the sea, the Italians, who\r\na week before had crossed the frontier, and with the Germans occupied\r\nLyons, had co-operated with us on land, and the terror-stricken\r\nMarseillais, hemmed in by fire and bullets on either side, had been\r\nswept away in thousands.\r\n\r\n\"The scenes in the streets were, we afterwards learnt, awful; and\r\nalthough the garrison offered a desperate resistance to the Italians\r\nalong the valley near the Chateau des Fleurs, most of them were killed,\r\nand nearly three thousand of their number taken prisoners. But the\r\nItalians were unable to enter Marseilles themselves, as, long before\r\nthey had succeeded in breaking up the land defences, we had set the\r\nplace on fire, and now, as night fell, the great city was one mass of\r\nflames, the lurid light from which illuminated sky and sea with a bright\r\nred glare.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe blazing African sun was fading, flooding the calm sapphire\r\nMediterranean with its blood-red afterglow. The air was oppressive, the\r\nwind blew hot from the desert, and shoals of tiny green birds were\r\nchattering before roosting in the oasis of tall date palms that cast\r\nlong shadows over the sun-baked stones of the Place du Gouvernement at\r\nAlgiers. Everything was of a dazzling whiteness, relieved only by the\r\nblue sky and sea. The broad, handsome Square was almost deserted, the\r\njalousies of the European houses were still closed, and although a few\r\npeople were sipping absinthe at the cafes, the siesta was not yet over.\r\n\r\nAt one corner of the Square the Mosque of Djama-el-Djedid, with its dome\r\nand minarets, stood out intensely white against the bright, cloudless\r\nsky, its spotless cleanliness causing the white-washed houses of\r\nEuropeans to appear yellow and dingy; and as the _mueddin_ stood on one\r\nof the minarets with arms uplifted, calling the Faithful to prayer, idle\r\nMoors and Arabs, who had been lying asleep in the shadow during the\r\nafternoon, rose quickly, rearranged their burnouses, and entered the\r\nMosque in order to render thanks to Allah.\r\n\r\nDarkness crept on after a brief twilight. Moorish women, wrapped in\r\ntheir white _haicks_, wearing their ugly baggy trousers, and veiled to\r\nthe eyes, waddled along slowly and noiselessly among the palms, and\r\ngradually a gay cosmopolitan crowd assembled in the Place to enjoy the\r\n_bel fresco_ after the terrible heat of the day, and to listen to the\r\nfine band of the 1st Zouaves, which had already taken up its stand in\r\nthe centre of the Square, and was now playing one of Strauss's dreamy\r\nwaltzes.\r\n\r\nThe night was bright and starlit, one of those calm, mystic evenings\r\npeculiar to North Africa. All was peaceful, but no moon had yet risen.\r\nThe city wore its gay air of carelessness. White-robed Moors and\r\nred-fezzed Arabs, negroes from the Soudan, and Biskris in their blue\r\nburnouses, lounged, chattered, and promenaded, while the cafes and\r\nbazaars around were full of life, and the warm, balmy air was laden with\r\nthe scent of flowers.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without warning, the whole place was illuminated by a\r\nbrilliant light from the sea. Slowly it swept the town, and a few\r\nseconds later other bright beams shot forth, lighting up the quays, the\r\nterraces of white, flat-roofed houses, and the Moorish city on the hill.\r\nThen, before the promenaders could realise the cause, a loud booming\r\nwas heard at sea, and almost at the same moment a shell fell, and,\r\nexploding in the midst of them, blew a dozen Moors and Arabs into atoms.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds the cannonade increased, and the battery in the centre\r\nof the harbour replied. Then firing seemed to proceed from all quarters,\r\nand a storm of shell suddenly crashed upon the town with the most\r\nappalling effect.\r\n\r\nBritish war-vessels had crept up within range, and were pouring the\r\nvials of Britain's wrath upon the ancient city of the Deys!\r\n\r\nThe detachment of vessels which, led by the new battleship _Jupiter_,\r\nwent south from St. Tropez, had received instructions to destroy Algiers\r\nand return with all speed to Cagliari, in Sardinia, to await further\r\ninstructions. The bombardment of the two cities simultaneously was in\r\norder to draw off the French Squadron from the position it had taken up\r\nnear Gibraltar, so that the British could fight and then run past them\r\ninto the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nHow far the manoeuvre succeeded is shown in the few interesting details\r\nof the bombardment given in the course of an interview which a reporter\r\nof the _Daily Telegraph_ had with Lieut. George Ingleton, of the\r\nfirst-class cruiser _Edgar_. The officer said:--\r\n\r\n\"We arrived off Algiers two hours after sundown, and after an inspection\r\nwith search-lights, began to let fly with our big guns. In a few minutes\r\nthe Al-Djefna Battery in the centre of the harbour replied, and a moment\r\nlater a very rigorous fire was poured forth from Fort Neuf on the right\r\nand Forts Bab-Azzoun and Conde on the left. All four were very strong,\r\nand in conjunction with coast-defence vessels offered a most vigorous\r\nresistance. So suddenly did we fire upon the town, that a frightful\r\npanic must have been caused. Before we had fired half a dozen times, a\r\nshot from one of our 22-tonners crashed into the dome of the Mosque and\r\ntotally demolished it, while another particularly well-aimed shell\r\nstruck the Mairie, a big handsome building on the Boulevard de la\r\nRepublique, facing the sea, tearing out a portion of the front. Then,\r\nturning our guns upon the long row of shops, banks, and hotels which\r\nformed the Boulevard, we pounded away most effectively, while several of\r\nour other vessels attended to the forts.\r\n\r\n\"During the first half-hour the four warships of the enemy gave us\r\nconsiderable trouble, but very soon our torpedoes had sunk two of them,\r\nand the other two were quickly captured.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, under the hot fire from the forts, the bombardment grew\r\nexciting. Shells were ricochetting on the water all round us, but our\r\nsearch-lights being now shut off, we offered a very indistinct target to\r\nthe enemy. On nearly all our ships, however, there were some slight\r\ncasualties. A shell severely damaged the superstructure of the\r\n_Jupiter_, while others rendered useless several of her machine guns. A\r\nshell penetrated the _Gannet_, unfortunately killing fourteen\r\nbluejackets; and had it not been that the deck of the _Edgar_ was\r\nprotected throughout, the consequences to us would also have been very\r\nserious. Nevertheless, our two 22-ton guns rendered valuable service,\r\nand contributed in no small measure to the demolition of the town.\r\n\r\n\"From the outset we could see that Algiers was totally unprepared for\r\nattack, and, continuing our fire calmly and regularly, we watched the\r\nflames bursting forth in every part of the town and leaping skyward. On\r\nshore the guns kept up their roaring thunder, although by aid of glasses\r\nwe could detect how effectual were our shells in wrecking the\r\nfortifications and laying in ruins the European quarter. Every moment we\r\nwere dealing terrible blows which shook the city to its foundations. The\r\nformidable city walls availed them nothing, for we could drop our shells\r\nanywhere we pleased, either on the hill at Mustapha or upon the pretty\r\nMoorish villas that lined the shore at St. Eugene.\r\n\r\n\"Blazing away at long range upon the town, we spread destruction\r\neverywhere. Houses toppled like packs of cards, mosques were blown into\r\nthe air, and public buildings swept away like grains of sand before the\r\nsirocco. Under such a fire thousands of natives and Europeans must have\r\nperished, for we were determined to carry out our intentions, and teach\r\nthe invaders a lesson they were not likely to easily forget. Time after\r\ntime our heavy guns crashed, while our 6-inch quick-firers kept up their\r\nroar, and our machine guns rattled continuously. As the hours went by,\r\nand we continued our work of merciless destruction, we were hit once or\r\ntwice, but beyond the loss of two men and some unimportant damage we\r\nescaped further punishment.\r\n\r\n\"The roar of our guns was deafening, and the smoke hung over the calm\r\nsea like a storm-cloud. Still we kept on in the face of the galling fire\r\nfrom the shore, and before midnight had the satisfaction of witnessing a\r\nmagnificent spectacle, for the isolated conflagrations gradually united\r\nand the whole town was in flames.\r\n\r\n\"We had accomplished our work, so with cheers for Old England we gave a\r\nparting shot, and turning were soon steaming away towards the Sicilian\r\ncoast, leaving Algiers a mass of roaring flame.\r\n\r\n\"The journey was uneventful until just before noon on the following day.\r\nI was at that time on duty, and suddenly, to my surprise, detected a\r\nnumber of ships. By the aid of our glasses, the captain and I found to\r\nour dismay that a number of the most powerful vessels of the Russian\r\nFleet were bearing down upon us! All our other vessels had made the same\r\ndiscovery, and I must confess that the meeting was somewhat\r\ndisconcerting. The strength of the Russian ironclads was such as to\r\ncause our hearts to beat more quickly. To engage that great force meant\r\ncertain defeat, while it was necessary that our Admiral off Marseilles\r\nshould know of the whereabouts of this hostile squadron, therefore we\r\nresolved to get away. But although we altered our course and put on all\r\nspeed, we were, alas! unsuccessful. At last we determined at all hazards\r\nto stick to our guns so long as we were afloat, and as the first of the\r\nTsar's ironclads drew within range, one of our 22-tonners thundered. The\r\nwhite smoke, driven forward, tumbled over our bows. We had spoken the\r\nfirst word of battle!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nA NAVAL FIGHT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The great naval force of the Tsar, with which we were now face to\r\nface,\" continued Lieutenant Ingleton in his narrative, \"consisted of the\r\nnew battleship _Petropavlovsk_ of 10,960 tons, with a speed of 17 knots;\r\nthe great turret-ship _Dvenadsat Apostoloff_ of 8076 tons; the two new\r\nbarbette-ships _Kama_ and _Vologda_ of the _Cizoi Veliky_ type; the\r\n_Tchesme_ of 10,181 tons, the _Gheorghy Pobyednosets_ of 10,280 tons,\r\nand the powerful _Tria Sviatitelia_ of 12,480 tons; the two enormous new\r\ncruisers _Tiumen_ and _Minsk_, both of 17,000 tons, and running at 20\r\nknots; the _Vladimir Monomach_ of 5754 tons; the armoured gunboat\r\n_Otvazny_, and the new rams _Admiral Seniavine_ and _Admiral Uschakoff_,\r\nwith thirty torpedo boats, including the _Kodor_, _Reni_, _Anakria_, and\r\n_Adler_, the latter being able to run at 27.4 knots.\r\n\r\n\"Against such a gigantic force as this our small force of vessels and\r\ntorpedo boats presented but a sorry appearance. Nevertheless we had\r\nfired the first shot, and were now determined to die rather than haul\r\ndown our colours. As our guns thundered, those of the _Jupiter_,\r\n_Repulse_, _Sans Pareil_, _Undaunted_, _Orlando_, _Diana_, _Scout_, and\r\n_Gannet_ joined in noisy chorus. The 12-inch guns in the turrets of the\r\n_Petropavlovsk_ and the four big guns in the barbettes of the _Tria\r\nSviatitelia_ crashed out together, and almost immediately afterwards we\r\nfound ourselves being swept from stem to stern by the enemy's shells.\r\nThe Russian battleships were all well armoured, and had a much heavier\r\nshell fire than the vessels of either France or Britain. We were both in\r\ncolumns of divisions in line ahead, but from the first moment of the\r\nengagement our position was critical.\r\n\r\n\"A terrific and deadly storm burst upon us from the enemy's tops, while\r\nhis heavy guns kept up an incessant thunder. With such an enormous force\r\nagainst us, it was apparent to every man on board that disaster was\r\nimminent. It had, alas! never been graven sufficiently deep upon the\r\npublic mind how absurdly weak we were in the Mediterranean. Here, as in\r\nall other squadrons, every grade of officer from commander downwards was\r\ndeficient in numbers, and the ships in commission had for years been so\r\nmuch below their complement that the work had only been carried on with\r\ngreat difficulty. Other ships at home had been obliged to wait until a\r\nsufficient number of merchant seamen and half-trained engine-room staff\r\ncould be scraped together to provide the semblance of a crew. In fact,\r\nsuccessive British Governments of both parties had subordinated national\r\nnecessities to a desire to evade a material increase in taxation, and\r\nnow at last our Mediterranean Squadron were compelled to face the\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\n\"The insidious cunning and patient methods to which the Russians resort\r\nin order to attain their aims and break their boundaries had once more\r\nbeen illustrated. They had, by dint of extraordinary chicanery, secured\r\nabsolute possession of the small Turkish peninsula known as Mount Athos.\r\nSituated near the entrance of the Gulf of Salonica, it was a paramount\r\nstrategical position, and its possessor was now enabled to keep watch\r\nupon Macedonia, and in the meantime be very near the Dardanelles, and\r\nalso Asia Minor. The possession was accomplished in a curiously secret\r\nmanner, showing to what extent Russian foresight and artifice is\r\ncarried. For years past the _Societe Slav de Bienfaisance_ had been\r\nsending, through a bank in Salonica, large sums of money to further the\r\naim. To the casual observer there was nothing extraordinary about this,\r\nfor the Russians had established on the lofty heights several\r\nmonasteries, converting the place into a clerical settlement. This fact\r\nwas pointed out by the _Pall Mall Gazette_ as far back as 1893, but the\r\nBritish public at that time failed to detect any Russian intrigue.\r\n\r\n\"Gradually, however, Muscovite roubles purchased the surrounding\r\nproperty, and Greek convents were reduced to poverty while Russian\r\ninstitutions flourished and increased. But, strangely enough, the\r\ninmates of these monasteries were suddenly discovered to be mock\r\nclerics, and then it was disclosed that under the cover of monastic\r\ngarments and robes were to be found the Tsar's soldiers, performing a\r\nthree years' special and specific military service!\r\n\r\n\"Yet, owing to the Sultan's weakness, to the almighty backsheesh, and to\r\nthe shortsightedness of Turkish statesmen, the Russians were not\r\ndislodged, but the position was actually ceded to them, with the result\r\nthat they had now firmly established themselves where they were enabled\r\nto counteract British action and influence. A naval station had been\r\nestablished for their Mediterranean Squadron at Poros, off the eastern\r\ncoast of the Peloponnesus, some fifteen miles due south of the island of\r\nAEgina. Here there were three miles of deep water safe from sea attack,\r\nwith an arsenal and dockyard, on the very weakest point along the line\r\nof our highway between England and India! Such was the manner in which\r\nour power in the Mediterranean had been undermined!\r\n\r\n\"There was, however, no time for reflection amid the deafening roar.\r\nThis Black Sea Fleet that had burst its bonds and passed through the\r\nDardanelles intended to sweep us from the sea. Yet, notwithstanding the\r\nterrible fire pouring upon us from these great and powerful ships, each\r\nfully equipped with the latest and most improved arms, fully manned by\r\nwell-trained men, and fresh for the fray, we held our quarters,\r\ndetermined to show the forces of the Tsar defiance. Even though every\r\nman of us might be sent to an untimely grave, the Russian flag should\r\nnever surmount the White Ensign of Britain. We were determined, so we\r\nset our teeth, and showed a firm and vigorous front to the foe.\r\n\r\n\"Our two 22-tonners rendered admirable service, and the cannonade kept\r\nup from our 3 and 6-pounder quick-firing guns was playing havoc with the\r\nRussian belted cruiser _Vladimir Monomach_ lying on our port quarter.\r\nThe vessel was slightly larger than ourselves, carrying much heavier\r\narmaments, including four 13-ton guns, and twelve 4-tonners. She was\r\nindeed a very formidable opponent, nevertheless we did our best, and,\r\nblazing away at close quarters, soon succeeded in silencing the\r\nstarboard 13-tonner nearest us.\r\n\r\n\"Just at this moment I found we were being attacked on the port bow by\r\nthe enormous new turret-ship _Petropavlovsk_ and the _Dvenadsat\r\nApostoloff_. Two of the heavy 12-inch guns of the former thundered\r\nalmost simultaneously, and both shells striking us almost amidships,\r\ncaused us such a shock that for a second I stood breathless.\r\n\r\n\"In a few moments, however, it was reported that our 'vitals' had\r\nfortunately escaped, and we continued firing as if no catastrophe had\r\noccurred. As a matter of fact, the damage caused by those two shells was\r\nappalling.\r\n\r\n\"The _Jupiter_, steaming about two miles away on our starboard quarter,\r\nwas apparently holding her own against the barbette-ships _Tchesme_ and\r\n_Gheorghy Pobyednosets_, the cruiser _Tiumen_, one of the largest in the\r\nworld, and the new ram _Admiral Seniavine_. The four attacking vessels,\r\nas seen through the dense smoke, were pouring into the British ship a\r\ndeadly fire; yet, judging from the fallen tops and disabled engines of\r\nthe _Gheorghy Pobyednosets_ and the wrecked superstructure of the\r\n_Tchesme_, the _Jupiter's_ heavy armaments were executing good work,\r\nnotwithstanding the strength of the _Tchesme's_ six 50-ton guns,\r\nadmirably arranged in pairs in the centre of the vessel.\r\n\r\n\"The _Diana_ and _Sans Pareil_, lying near to one another, were\r\ndesperately resisting the vigorous attack made by the _Admiral\r\nUschakoff_, _Minsk_, _Otvazny_, _Kama_, and _Vologda_; and here again,\r\namid smoke and flying debris, I could distinguish that the 67-tonners of\r\nthe _Repulse_, in co-operation with the lighter weapons of the\r\n_Undaunted_, were giving the enemy a taste of what British courage could\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\n\"The sea around us simply swarmed with Russian torpedo boats, and it\r\nrequired all our vigilance to evade their continued attacks. Before an\r\nhour had passed we had succeeded in sinking two by shots from our 6-inch\r\nguns, and several more were sent to the bottom by well-aimed projectiles\r\nfrom the _Dido_ and _Jupiter_.\r\n\r\n\"As for ourselves, projectiles were sweeping across our deck like hail,\r\nand under the incessant and fearful fire we were suffering frightfully.\r\nOver sixty of our men and a sub-lieutenant had been killed, while\r\nforty-nine were severely wounded. Once I had occasion to go below, and\r\nbetween decks the sight that met my gaze was awful.\r\n\r\n\"Around two of the quick-firing guns on our port quarter lay the guns'\r\ncrews, mutilated by shells from the _Vladimir Monomach_. They had been\r\nkilled almost instantly while standing bravely at their posts. The scene\r\nwas appalling. The mangled masses of humanity amid which the surgeons\r\nwere at work were awful to look upon, and I rushed up again with the\r\nterrible scene photographed indelibly upon my memory.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile the ship was in the greatest peril. The continual bursting of\r\nshells upon her shook and shattered her, and she trembled violently as,\r\ntime after time, her own guns uttered their thundering reply to her\r\nenemies. Heeling now this way, now that, as the helm was put hard over\r\nto avoid a blow, the situation on board was intensely exciting.\r\n\r\n\"Those were terrible moments. The captain suddenly noticed the movements\r\nof the _Vladimir Monomach_, and divined her intentions. She had ceased\r\nfiring, and by a neatly executed manoeuvre was preparing to ram us. In a\r\nmoment our helm was put over again, and the _Edgar_ answered to it\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\"'Ready bow tube!' I heard the captain shout hoarsely. He waited a few\r\nmoments, allowing the Russian ironclad to partially perform her\r\nevolution, then just as she came almost into collision with us he\r\nshrieked 'Fire bow tube!' at the same time bringing us over further to\r\nport.\r\n\r\n\"The seconds seemed hours. Suddenly there was a loud explosion, a great\r\ncolumn of water rose under the Russian's bow, and we knew the torpedo\r\nhad struck. At that moment, too, even while the water was still in the\r\nair, one of our torpedo boats which had crept up under the _Vladimir\r\nMonomach's_ stern sent another torpedo at her, which also hit its mark\r\nand ripped her up. Turning our guns upon the armoured cruiser, we poured\r\nvolley after volley into her, but she did not reply, for her men were\r\npanic-stricken, and she was sinking fast.\r\n\r\n\"The _Petropavlovsk_, leaving us, endeavoured to rescue her crew, but\r\nere a dozen men were saved, she settled down bow foremost, and\r\ndisappeared into the deep, carrying down with her nearly five hundred\r\nofficers and men.\r\n\r\n\"The _Dvenadsat Apostoloff_ kept up her fire upon us, and a few moments\r\nlater I witnessed another disaster, for a shot from one of her bow guns\r\nstruck the torpedo boat that had just assisted us, and sank it. A few\r\nminutes later a loud explosion in the direction of the _Sans Pareil_\r\nattracted my attention, and, turning, I saw amid the smoke-clouds debris\r\nprecipitated high into the air. A shot from one of her 111-ton guns had\r\npenetrated to the magazine of the _Admiral Seniavine_, which had\r\nexploded, causing a frightful disaster on board that vessel, and just at\r\nthe same moment a cheer from the crew of one of our 6-inch guns prompted\r\nme to look for the cause, which I found in the fact that they had shot\r\nthe Russian colours completely away from the _Dvenadsat Apostoloff_.\r\n\r\n\"Again another frightful explosion sounded loud above the incessant din,\r\nand to my satisfaction I saw a great column of water rise around the\r\n_Admiral Uschakoff_, which, fighting at close quarters with the _Dido_,\r\nhad apparently been torpedoed. Not satisfied with this, the captain of\r\nthe _Dido_, keeping his machine guns going, turned his vessel and\r\ndischarged a second Whitehead, which also struck with such terrible\r\neffect that the Russian ship began at once to sink, and in a few minutes\r\nthe blue waves closed for ever over her tops, ere a score or so out of\r\nher crew of 300 could be rescued.\r\n\r\n\"It was nearly three bells, and the sun was setting. A galling fire from\r\nthe machine guns in the foretop of the _Dvenadsat Apostoloff_ suddenly\r\nswept our deck, killing a dozen poor fellows who were at work clearing\r\naway some debris, and at the same moment a shot from one of her 52-ton\r\nguns crashed into our port quarter, and must have caused terrible havoc\r\namong the guns' crews. A moment later we were dismayed by the report\r\nthat our steering-gear had been broken. For a few seconds we were\r\nhelplessly swinging round under the awful fire which was now pouring\r\nfrom the great guns of the Russian ironclad, and our captain was making\r\nstrenuous efforts to recover control of the ship, when I saw the torpedo\r\nboat _Anakria_ shoot suddenly across our bows, then quickly slacken as\r\nshe got to starboard of us.\r\n\r\n\"A second later I realised her intention, and shouted frantically. A\r\nline of bubbles had appeared on the surface advancing swiftly towards\r\nus. She had ejected a torpedo straight at us, and I stood petrified, not\r\ndaring to breathe.\r\n\r\n\"A moment later there came a terrific explosion right underneath us,\r\nfollowed by a harsh tearing sound as iron plates were torn asunder like\r\ntinfoil, and the ship's side was ripped completely up. The _Edgar_\r\nheaved high and plunged heavily, a great column of water rose high above\r\nher masts, and the air seemed filled with flying fragments of iron and\r\nwood. The vessel rocked and swayed so that we could not keep our feet,\r\nand then gradually heeling over, causing her guns to shift, she went\r\ndown before a soul on board could launch a boat.\r\n\r\n\"At the moment of the explosion I felt a sharp twinge in the back, and\r\nfound that I had been struck by a flying splinter of steel. The strain\r\nof those hours had been terrible, and of the events that followed I can\r\nonly recollect two things. I remember finding myself struggling alone in\r\nthe water with a shower of bullets from the _Dvenadsat Apostoloff's_\r\ntops sending up little splashes about me. Then I felt my strength\r\nfailing, my limbs seemed paralysed, and I could no longer strike out to\r\nsave myself. Abandoning all hope, I was sinking, when suddenly a rope\r\nwas flung to me. I remember how frantically I clutched it, and that a\r\nfew moments later I was hauled aboard a torpedo boat; but for days\r\nafterwards I lay hovering 'twixt life and death, oblivious to all. I\r\nwas one of the thirteen only who were saved out of a crew of 327 brave\r\nofficers and men.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a ghastly disaster could only produce profound dismay among those\r\nwho manned the remaining British vessels. Straining every nerve to\r\nuphold the honour of Britain, the guns' crews of the _Jupiter_, _Sans\r\nPareil_, _Repulse_, and _Undaunted_, with smoke-begrimed hands and\r\nfaces, worked on with that indomitable energy begotten of despair.\r\nRegardless of the awful rain of shot and shell, they reloaded and fired\r\nwith calm, dogged self-possession, the officers on all four vessels\r\ninspiring their men by various deeds of valour, and preserving such\r\ndiscipline under fire as none but British sailors could. The British\r\nnaval officer is full of undaunted defiance and contempt for his foes;\r\nbut, above all, he is a strict disciplinarian, and to this our country\r\nin a great measure owes the supremacy our Navy has hitherto enjoyed upon\r\nthe seas. During the fight the vessels had been moving in a\r\nnorth-easterly direction, and although the Russians were unaware of the\r\nfact, Her Majesty's ships had therefore continued in their course.\r\nHence, just as a cool breeze sprang up at sundown, soon after the\r\n_Edgar_ had sunk, a line of low dark cliffs was sighted ahead.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the _Diana_, watching anxiously through their glasses,\r\ndistinguished the distant crest of Mount Genargentu gradually appearing\r\nagainst the clear evening sky, and then they knew that they were off\r\nSardinia, outside the Gulf of Oristano.\r\n\r\nAltering their course, they headed due north, still keeping up a running\r\nfire, but the Russians prevented them making headway.\r\n\r\nAll our vessels were suffering frightfully, when there was a sudden\r\nexplosion, and, to the Englishmen's dismay, it was seen that a torpedo\r\nhad struck the _Undaunted_ nearly amidships. Still the doomed vessel\r\nmanaged to evade a second attack, and by a desperate manoeuvre the\r\ncaptain succeeded in turning and heading for land.\r\n\r\nThe remaining ships, in their terribly crippled condition, would, the\r\nRussians anticipated, soon fall an easy prey. Nevertheless, with their\r\ncrews decimated, their guns disabled, and their machinery damaged, the\r\nBritish vessels still continued firing, the men resolved to go down at\r\ntheir quarters. They knew that escape was hopeless, and every moment\r\nthey saw their comrades being swept away by the great exploding\r\nprojectiles of the Tsar's heavy guns. But they were not dismayed. To do\r\ntheir utmost for the defence of Britain, to keep afloat as long as\r\npossible, and to die like Britons with faces towards the foe, was their\r\nduty. Pale and desperate, they were fighting for their country and their\r\nQueen, knowing that only a grave in the deep and the honour of those at\r\nhome would be the reward of their bravery--that at any moment they might\r\nbe launched into the unknown.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a loud shouting on board the _Jupiter_, and signals\r\nwere, a moment later, run up to her half-wrecked top. The captain of the\r\n_Dido_, noticing this, looked to ascertain the cause, and saw away on\r\nthe horizon to the north, whence the dark night clouds were rising, a\r\nnumber of strange craft. Snatching up his glass, he directed it on the\r\nstrangers, and discovered that they were Italian warships, and were\r\nexchanging rapid signals with the captain. They were promising\r\nassistance!\r\n\r\nCheers rang loudly through the British vessels, when, a few minutes\r\nlater, the truth became known, and the guns' crews worked with redoubled\r\nenergy, while the Russians, noticing the approaching ships, were\r\napparently undecided how to act. They were given but little time for\r\nreflection, however, for within half an hour the first of the great\r\nItalian ironclads, the _Lepanto_, opened fire upon the _Petropavlovsk_,\r\nand was quickly followed by others, until the action became general all\r\nround.\r\n\r\nAid had arrived just in time, and the British vessels, with engines\r\nbroken, stood away at some distance, leaving matters for the nonce to\r\nthe powerful Italian Squadron. It was indeed a very formidable one, and\r\nits appearance caused the Russian Admiral such misgivings that he gave\r\norders to retreat, a manoeuvre attempted unsuccessfully. The Italian\r\nFleet, as it loomed up in the falling gloom, included no fewer than\r\ntwenty-six warships and forty-three torpedo boats. The vessels consisted\r\nof the barbette-ship _Lepanto_ of 15,000 tons; the _Sardegna_,\r\n_Sicilia_, and _Re Umberto_ of 13,000 tons; the _Andrea Doria_,\r\n_Francesca Morosini_, and _Ruggiero di Lauria_ of 11,000 tons; the\r\nturret-ships _Dandolo_ and _Duilio_ of the same size; the _Ammeraglio di\r\nSt. Bon_ of 9800 tons; the armoured cruisers _Ancona_, _Castelfidardo_,\r\nand _Maria Pia_, and the _San Martino_, each of about 4500 tons; the\r\ngun-vessels _Andrea Provana_, _Cariddi_, _Castore_, _Curtatone_; the\r\ntorpedo gunboats _Aretusa_, _Atlante_, _Euridice_, _Iride_,\r\n_Montebello_, and _Monzambano_; the despatch vessels _Galileo_ and\r\n_Vedetta_; and the first-class torpedo vessels _Aquila_, _Avvoltoio_,\r\n_Falco_, _Nibbio_, and _Sparviero_, and thirty-eight others.\r\n\r\nWith such a force descending upon the Russian ships, which had already\r\nbeen very severely punished by the vigorous fire of the British, there\r\nwas little wonder that the Tsar's vessels should endeavour to escape.\r\nThe Italian Fleet had already bombarded and destroyed Ajaccio two days\r\nago, and, steaming south from the Corsican capital, had anchored for\r\ntwenty-four hours off Cape della Caccia, near Alghero, in the north of\r\nSardinia. Then again taking a southerly course in the expectation of\r\njoining hands with the British Mediterranean Squadron, which was on its\r\nway from Marseilles to Cagliari, they had fallen in with the three\r\ncrippled ships.\r\n\r\nWithout hesitation the powerful Italian ironclads, several of which were\r\namong the finest in the world, opened a terrific fire upon the Russian\r\nships, and as darkness fell the sight was one of appalling grandeur.\r\nFrom all sides flame rushed from turrets and barbettes in vivid flashes,\r\nwhile the Maxims in the tops poured out their deadly showers of bullets.\r\nThe ponderous 105-ton guns of the _Andrea Doria_, _Francesca Morosini_,\r\nand _Ruggiero di Lauria_ crashed and roared time after time, their great\r\nshots causing frightful havoc among the Russian ships, the four\r\n100-tonners of the _Lepanto_ and the 67-tonners of the _Re Umberto_,\r\n_Sardegna_, and _Sicilia_ simply knocking to pieces the _Petropavlovsk_.\r\nThe Russian ships were receiving terrible blows on every hand. With\r\ntheir search-lights beaming forth in all directions, the ships were\r\nfighting fiercely, pounding away at each other with deafening din. It\r\nwas not long, however, before this vigorous attack of the Italians began\r\nto tell, for within an hour of the first shot from the _Lepanto_ the\r\nfine Russian battleship _Gheorghy Pobyednosets_ and the great new\r\ncruiser _Minsk_ of 17,000 tons had been rammed and sunk, the former by\r\nthe _Duilio_, and the latter by the _Re Umberto_, while the _Tchesme_\r\nand the gunboat _Otvazny_ had been torpedoed, and scarcely a soul saved\r\nout of 1500 men who were on board.\r\n\r\nExplosions were occurring in quick succession, and red glares flashed\r\nmomentarily over the sea. Hither and thither as the Italian torpedo\r\nboats darted they ejected their missiles, and the rapid and terrible\r\nfire from the leviathans of Italy, pouring into every one of the\r\nremaining ships of the Tsar, killed hundreds who were striving to defend\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the _Sicilia_, which had been fighting the Russian flagship,\r\nthe _Tria Sviatitelia_, at close quarters, and had blown away her\r\nconning-tower and greater portion of her superstructure, performed a\r\nneat evolution, and crashed her ram right into her opponent's broadside,\r\nbreaking her almost in half.\r\n\r\nA few moments later there was a terrific explosion on board, and then\r\nthe doomed vessel sank into the dark rolling sea, carrying with her the\r\nRussian Admiral and all hands.\r\n\r\nQuickly this success was followed by others--the blowing up of the\r\nmonster new cruiser _Tiumen_, the sinking of the _Adler_ and four other\r\nRussian torpedo boats, occurring in rapid succession. Seeing with what\r\nrapidity and irresistible force they were being swept from the sea, the\r\nremainder of the Tsar's shattered fleet struck their flags and called\r\nfor quarter, not, however, before the torpedo boat _Kodor_ had been\r\nsunk. The Russians thus captured were the battleships _Petropavlovsk_ of\r\n10,960 tons, the _Dvenadsat Apostoloff_ of 8076 tons, the two new\r\nbarbette-ships, _Kama_ and _Vologda_, both of whose engines had broken\r\ndown, and fifteen torpedo boats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_Ruggiero di Lauria._  _Re Umberto._ _Duilio._ _Tchesme._\r\n_Dvenadsat Apostoloff._\r\n_H.M.S. Edgar._\r\nHELP FROM ITALY: \"WITH THEIR SEARCH-LIGHTS BEAMING FORTH IN ALL\r\nDIRECTIONS, THE SHIPS WERE FIGHTING FIERCELY, POUNDING AWAY AT EACH\r\nOTHER WITH DEAFENING DIN.\"]\r\n\r\nAt dawn most of the latter were manned by Italians, while the captured\r\nships, with the Italian colours flying and bearing evidence of the\r\nterrible conflict, were on their way due north to Genoa, accompanied by\r\nthe battered British vessels.\r\n\r\nThe strongest division of Russia's Fleet had been totally destroyed, and\r\nthe Tsar's power in the Mediterranean was broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nPANIC IN LANCASHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russians were within gunshot of Manchester! A profound sensation was\r\ncaused in that city about eight o'clock on the evening of September 6th,\r\nby an announcement made by the _Evening News_--which still appeared in\r\nfitful editions--that a Cossack patrol had been seen on the road between\r\nMacclesfield and Alderley, and that it was evident, from the manner of\r\nthe Russian advance, that they meant to attack the city almost\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nThe utmost alarm was caused, and the streets were everywhere crowded by\r\nanxious, starving throngs, eager to ascertain fuller details, but unable\r\nto gather anything further beyond the wild conjectures of idle gossip.\r\n\r\nThe great city which, on the outbreak of war, was one of the most\r\nprosperous in the world, was now but a sorry semblance of its former\r\nself. Heated, excited, turbulent, its streets echoed with the\r\nheartrending wails of despairing crowds, its factories were idle, its\r\nshops closed, and its people were succumbing to the horrible, lingering\r\ndeath which is the result of starvation.\r\n\r\nWealth availed them naught. Long ago the last loaf had been devoured,\r\nthe last sack of flour had been divided, and the rich living in the\r\nsuburbs now felt the pinch of hunger quite as acutely as factory\r\noperatives, who lounged, hands in pockets, about the streets.\r\nManchester, like most other towns in England, had come to the end of\r\nher supplies, and death and disease now decimated the more populous\r\ndistricts, while those who had left the city and tramped north had fared\r\nno better, and hundreds dropped and died by the roadside.\r\n\r\nThe situation in Lancashire was terrible. At Liverpool a few vessels\r\nwere arriving from America, under escort of British cruisers, bringing\r\nsupplies, but these were mostly purchased at enormously high rates, and\r\nsent to London by way of Manchester and Sheffield, railway communication\r\nby that route being still open. This fact becoming known in Manchester\r\ncaused the greatest indignation, and the people, rendered desperate by\r\nhunger, succeeded on several occasions in stopping the trains, and\r\nappropriating the food they carried. The situation in Manchester was one\r\nof constant excitement, and fear that the enemy should repeat the\r\nsuccess they had achieved at Birmingham. The hundreds of thousands of\r\nhungry ones who flocked Manchester streets and the grimy thoroughfares\r\nof Stockport, Ashton, Oldham, Bolton, and other great towns in the\r\nvicinity, feared that they, like the people of Birmingham, would be put\r\nto the sword by the ruthless invaders.\r\n\r\nThe week that had elapsed had been an eventful one, fraught with many\r\nhorrors. After the success of the Russians at Birmingham, the British\r\ntroops, both Regulars, Volunteers, and improvised, fell back and formed\r\nup north of the city, being practically nothing more than a strong line\r\nof outposts without reserves, extending from Dudley, through West\r\nBromwich and Sutton Park, to Tamworth. This scheme, however, was\r\nill-devised, for the defenders, in order to act successfully, should\r\nhave fallen back much further, and concentrated their forces at one or\r\ntwo strategical points on the line to Manchester, as it had been\r\nascertained from spies that a swift and vigorous attack on that city was\r\nmeditated.\r\n\r\nThe day following the taking of Birmingham was devoted by the enemy to\r\nthe reorganisation of their forces, and the rearrangement of their\r\ntransport and ammunition train. Large quantities of waggons and war\r\nstores of all kinds had been found in the town and annexed by the\r\nvictors, and at Kynoch's Factory at Aston some hundreds of thousands of\r\nrounds of ammunition had been seized. These had been made for a foreign\r\ngovernment, and fitted both rifles and machine guns of the Russians.\r\n\r\nHaving thus reorganised, the Russians, leaving 10,000 men in Birmingham\r\nas a base, resumed their march north on the third day. The left flank,\r\nconsisting of 2000 cavalry and 12,000 infantry, took the road through\r\nWest Bromwich to Wednesbury and Bilston, but quickly found themselves\r\nentrapped, for on account of the many canals their cavalry were unable\r\nto act, and their transport was cut off. The miners and factory men had\r\narmed themselves, and, acting in conjunction with the British troops\r\nfrom Dudley and Great Barr, succeeded, after some hard fighting around\r\nTipton and Coseley, in completely annihilating the enemy, taking 5000\r\nprisoners and killing the remaining 9000.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the right flank had passed out of Birmingham by way of Castle\r\nBromwich, and had advanced without opposition through Wishaw and\r\nTamworth to Lichfield, driving the defenders before them. The Russian\r\nmain column, however, were not allowed to go north without a most\r\ndesperate endeavour on the part of our men to hold them in check.\r\nIndeed, if ever British courage showed itself it was during those dark\r\ndays. Advancing through Aston and Perry to Sutton along the ancient\r\nhighway, Icknield Street, the Russians sent a large force through the\r\nwoods to the high ground between Wild Green and Maney. Here the British\r\nhad established strong batteries, but after some desperate fighting\r\nthese were at length captured, the enemy losing heavily. At the same\r\ntime, fierce fighting occurred in Sutton Park and across at Aldridge,\r\nthe defenders making the most strenuous efforts to break the force of\r\nthe invaders. All was, alas! to no purpose. The British, outnumbered as\r\nbefore, were compelled to fall back fighting, with the result that the\r\nenemy's main column, pushing on, effected a junction with its right\r\nflank, which had bivouaced on Wittington Heath, near Lichfield, and\r\noccupied the barracks there.\r\n\r\nOn the day following the invaders broke into two columns and marched\r\nagain north, practically in battle formation, the right column\r\ncontinuing along Icknield Street, through Burton, Derby, Bakewell, and\r\nMarple, driving back the defenders, while the left column took a route\r\nthat lay through the hilly and wooded country near Cannock Chase. Both\r\ncolumns, advancing in echelon of division, with cavalry on their flanks,\r\nwere constantly harassed in the rear by the British, and in their\r\nadvance lost numbers of waggons and a large quantity of ammunition; but\r\nthey succeeded in travelling so quickly north that they were actually\r\nmarching on Manchester before the people in that city could realise it.\r\nSignal acts of bravery were being everywhere reported, but what could\r\nindividual heroism effect against the fearful odds we had to face?\r\n\r\nThousands of men in Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Wigan, Rochdale, and other\r\nneighbouring towns had already armed themselves, and, on hearing that\r\nManchester was threatened, poured into the city to act their part\r\nbravely in its defence.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the British General commanding had, on gaining\r\nknowledge of the intentions of the Russians, taken every precaution in\r\nhis power to prevent an advance on Manchester.\r\n\r\nOur troops which had been defeated and driven back from Birmingham, had\r\nat once retreated north to the Peak district, and about one-quarter of\r\nthe number had taken up excellent defensive positions there, while the\r\nremainder, with small reinforcements of Regulars drawn from Lancaster,\r\nWarrington, Bury, Chester, Wrexham, Burnley, Ashton-under-Lyne, York,\r\nHalifax, and as far distant as Carlisle, had, in addition to those from\r\nManchester, been massed along the north bank of the Mersey from\r\nStockport to Flixton, with a line of communication stretching across to\r\nWoodley Junction, and thence over Glossop Dale to the Peak.\r\n\r\nThus Manchester was defended by a force of 38,000 cavalry, infantry,\r\nVolunteers, and colonials, against the Russian army, consisting of the\r\nremaining 65,000 of the force which attacked Birmingham, and\r\nreinforcements of 10,000 infantry and 5000 cavalry that had been pushed\r\nrapidly forward from Sussex over the ground that the main body had\r\ntravelled. The total force of Russians was therefore 80,000.\r\n\r\nFrom Stockport, the north bank of the Mersey to its confluence with the\r\nIrwell past Flixton was well guarded. Earthworks had been raised,\r\ntrenches dug, walls had been loopholed, and houses placed in a state of\r\nhasty defence. Among the reinforcements now under arms were several\r\nportions of battalions of Lancashire Volunteer Artillery who had not\r\ngone south to their allotted positions in the defence of London, and\r\nfive companies of the 1st Cheshire and Carnarvonshire Artillery under\r\nCol. H. T. Brown, V.D., together with the Cheshire Yeomanry under Col.\r\nP. E. Warburton. The Manchester Brigade was a strong one, consisting of\r\nsix Volunteer battalions of the Manchester Regiment, the 1st under the\r\nEarl of Crawford, V.D., the 2nd under Col. Bridgford, V.D., the 3rd\r\nunder Col. Eaton, V.D., the 4th under Col. Lynde, V.D., the 5th under\r\nCol. Rocca, V.D., and the 6th under Col. Lees; the Cheshire and\r\nLancashire Brigades included three Volunteer battalions of the\r\nLancashire Fusiliers under Colonels Young, Philippi, and Haworth, and\r\ntwo battalions of the South Lancashire Regiment; while the Northern\r\nCounties Brigade, composed of one Volunteer battalion of the Royal\r\nLancaster Regiment under Col. Strongitharm, two battalions of the East\r\nLancashire Regiment under Col. A. I. Robinson, V.D., and Col. T.\r\nMitchell, V.D., and two of the Loyal North Lancashire under Col. Widdows\r\nand Col. Ormrod, also mustered their forces and performed excellent\r\ndefensive work. It was here, too, that the Volunteer cyclists were found\r\nof the utmost value in scouting and carrying despatches.\r\n\r\nThe excitement in Manchester on that memorable September night was\r\nintense. That a desperate and bloody fray was imminent, every one knew,\r\nand the people were trusting to the defensive line on the river bank to\r\nprotect them from the foreign destroyer. Would they be strong enough to\r\neffectively resist? Would they be able to drive back the Russians and\r\ndefeat them?\r\n\r\nThe people of Lancashire who condemned our military administration did\r\nnot do so without cause. It had been claimed by many that England could\r\nnever be invaded; nevertheless our course should have been to prepare\r\nfor possible events. Our Army, being small, should have been better\r\nequipped and armed, as well as trained to balance weakness in numbers.\r\nAgain, there had always existed a hideous hindrance to the efficiency of\r\nthe Auxiliaries--the arms. Many of the Martini-Henrys carried by the\r\nVolunteers bore date of a quarter of a century ago, and their barrels\r\nwere so worn they could not be fired accurately; while others possessed\r\nthe Snider, which was practically a smoothbore from wear. What was the\r\nuse of weapons surpassed in power by those of other nations? It was an\r\nunpalatable truth that had now at last dawned upon Britain, that in\r\narming her soldiers she was far behind the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nWhile Manchester spent the sultry night in feverish excitement at the\r\nknowledge that the enemy had advanced almost to their doors, the British\r\noutposts were being harassed by the enemy, who, flushed with success,\r\nwere advancing gradually onward towards the line of defence. The Russian\r\nfront had been suddenly widely extended, evidently aiming at a\r\nconcentric attack on Manchester, and an attempt to wholly envelop the\r\ndefenders' position by cavalry operating on both flanks.\r\n\r\nSome terribly desperate encounters took place during a frightful\r\nthunderstorm which lasted a portion of the night, and many a brave\r\nBriton fell while performing valiant deeds for the honour of his\r\ncountry. The anxiety within the British lines that hot night was\r\nintense.\r\n\r\nReports coming in told of fierce fighting all along the line. Soon after\r\nmidnight a British patrol, supported by cavalry, that had been sent out\r\nfrom Northenden to Baguley, was suddenly attacked by a party of\r\nRussians, who lay in ambush close to Wythenshaw Hall. A short but fierce\r\nfight ensued, but the British, knowing that part of the country well,\r\nsucceeded in totally annihilating their antagonists. The firing,\r\nhowever, attracted attention in the Russian lines, with the result that\r\na second attack was quickly made upon them, compelling them to retire up\r\nthe hill at Lawton Moor, where they dashed into a small wood, closely\r\npressed by the enemy. The attack was desperate. There is something\r\nterrible in a fight in a wood at night. The combatants could see nothing\r\nsave an occasional flash in the impenetrable darkness, and hoarse cries\r\nwent up from the mysterious inferno. Neither invader nor defender could\r\ndistinguish each other, and in the half-hour that followed, many a\r\nRussian shot his comrade in mistake for his foe.\r\n\r\nAt last the defenders, finding that the slightest rustling of boughs\r\nbrought down a volley from magazine rifles, stood motionless, scarcely\r\ndaring to breathe, and waited anxiously, until at last the enemy, seeing\r\nthat their efforts to drive them out were useless, withdrew, and went\r\noff towards Baguley.\r\n\r\nIn another direction, close to Henbury, near Macclesfield, a squadron of\r\nBritish cavalry surprised a small outpost camp of Russians, and cut it\r\nup terribly, killing half the number; but pushing on to Marthall, six\r\nmiles across country, they came into collision with a body of Russian\r\ndragoons, and after a very fierce encounter were compelled to fall back\r\nagain after considerable loss. On the outskirts of Northwich, and on the\r\nborders of Delamere Forest, skirmishes occurred, resulting in serious\r\nloss on both sides. A reconnoitring party of Russians was totally swept\r\naway and every man killed, by a British party who were concealed in an\r\nold farm building close to Alderley village; while another engaged in\r\nsurveying the roads to Altrincham had been forced to retreat, leaving\r\nhalf their number dead or wounded on the edge of Tatton Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE EVE OF BATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome idea of the gallant conduct of our Volunteers during the night may\r\nbe gathered from the following extract from a letter by Lieutenant John\r\nRowling of the 2nd Volunteer Battalion of the East Lancashire Regiment,\r\nto a friend a few days afterwards. He wrote--\r\n\r\n\"You will no doubt have heard something about the warm work we had on\r\nthe night before the Battle of Manchester. The city, as you know, was\r\ncovered on the south by a long straggling line of outposts, extending\r\npractically from Stockport to Altrincham. Late in the afternoon of\r\nSeptember 6th we received an order to proceed to Mere, about four miles\r\nfrom Altrincham, having been detailed to form the section of the\r\noutposts from New Tatton to Goodier's Green, and on arrival at Mere half\r\nof our force of 600 was left in reserve there; the supports were moved\r\nabout half a mile down Watling Street, and the remainder was divided\r\ninto three piquets, No. 1 at Bentley Hurst Farm, No. 2 at Moss Cottage,\r\nand No. 3 near Mereplatt Farm, with four double sentry posts out in\r\nfront of each piquet.\r\n\r\n\"I was in command of No. 2 picket, with Anderson and Wishton as subs,\r\nand as soon as I returned to the piquet, after posting the sentries, I\r\nsent the former with two sections to form a detached post at Over\r\nTabley, and instructed him to send a reconnoitring patrol as far down\r\nWatling Street as he might consider consistent with safety. Anderson\r\nposted his men, and returned to me about ten o'clock with a corporal and\r\ntwo men, bringing in a man who had been pointed out to him at Over\r\nTabley as a suspicious character--in fact, he was said to be a spy. He\r\nhad been staying at an inn there for two or three days, and had very\r\nlittle luggage. Anderson had examined his portmanteau, but found nothing\r\nthere; and as the man refused to give any account of himself, he made\r\nhim a prisoner. Fresh fires were continually breaking out, therefore I\r\nthought it best to waste no time questioning him, but took him into a\r\nroom at Moss Cottage, where he was thoroughly searched. Notes were found\r\nupon him from which it was evident that he had been obtaining\r\ninformation for the enemy for some time, and, better still, particulars\r\nof their proposed operations for the investment of Manchester, showing\r\nthat they were advancing in our direction along the old Watling Street.\r\n\r\n\"I sent the prisoner under escort to the commander of the outposts, and\r\nat the same time sent word to Nos. 1 and 3 piquets, after which Anderson\r\nand I went down to Over Tabley, leaving Wishton in charge of No. 2. The\r\nmachine gun that had been allotted to my piquet I also ordered to Over\r\nTabley, and on arrival there we threw up barricades, hastily constructed\r\nof barrels, doors, and logs, banked with earth, across the road between\r\nthe Vicarage and the church. A quantity of barbed wire was found in the\r\nvillage, and this came in very useful, for we stretched several lengths\r\nof it across the roads on the off-side of the barricade.\r\n\r\n\"There were under thirty of us, but every man was determined to do his\r\nduty unflinchingly. By this time it was past eleven, and very dark, yet\r\nthere was just light enough to train the gun on to the centre of the\r\ncross-roads by Dairyhouse Farm. Very soon we could hear the enemy\r\napproaching, and as their spy had not met them outside, they evidently\r\nconcluded that the village was unoccupied, and advanced in comparatively\r\nclose order, Cossacks leading, and the infantry so close that there was\r\npractically no division between their vanguard and mainguard. The first\r\nsection of Cossacks very soon found our first wire, and the whole of\r\ntheir horses came to grief. Those in the rear, thinking probably that\r\nthere was no other obstruction in the way, spurred their horses and\r\ngalloped over their friends, only to meet with a similar fate further\r\non.\r\n\r\n\"The pioneers doubled up, and began to cut the wires, and fearing that\r\nthe infantry in the rear would soon deploy, I gave the order for\r\nindependent firing. The Russians stood it for some minutes, and\r\nattempted to reply, but not a man of ours was visible, and they soon\r\nretreated to Tabley Hall, where I had no means of following them.\r\n\r\n\"It must be remembered that we were all Volunteers, the Regulars being\r\non the Stockport flank of the outpost line. My men behaved splendidly,\r\nand the firing was excellent from first to last.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same time as the unsuccessful attack was made on the outposts\r\nat Mere, the British line was broken through at Heald Green and\r\nAppletree.\r\n\r\nA cavalry patrol, supported by infantry, was feeling its way along the\r\nroad to Wilmslow, and had passed Willow Farm, at which point the road\r\nruns beside the railway embankment.\r\n\r\nThe storm had burst, the thunder rolled incessantly, rain fell in\r\ntorrents, and the lightning played about them, causing their arms to\r\ngleam in its vivid flashes.\r\n\r\nSlowly, and without undue noise, the patrol was wending its way up the\r\nhill towards Finney Green, when suddenly there was a terrific rattle of\r\nmusketry, and they discovered to their surprise that the enemy, who were\r\noccupying the embankment of the North-Western Railway on their left,\r\nwere pouring upon them a fire sufficient to blanch the cheek of the\r\nbravest among them.\r\n\r\nAlong the embankment for a mile or more were stationed infantry with\r\nmagazine rifles, and in addition they had brought two machine guns into\r\nplay with appalling effect. So sudden did this galling fire open upon\r\nthem, that men and horses fell without being able to fire a shot in\r\nreturn. British infantry, however, stood their ground, and as the\r\nlightning flashed, disclosing the position of the enemy, every Russian\r\nwho dared to stand up or show himself was promptly picked off. But\r\nagainst the awful rain of deadly bullets ejected from the machine guns,\r\nat the rate of 600 a minute, no force could make a successful defence.\r\n\r\nMany British heroes fell pierced by a dozen bullets; still their\r\ncomrades, seeking what shelter they could, continued the defensive.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile over the dismal muddy road the survivors of the cavalry\r\ngalloped back, and quickly reported to the commander of the piquet at\r\nAppletree that the enemy were in strong force on the other side of the\r\nembankment between Oaklands and Wilmslow Park, and as they had heard a\r\ntrain run into Wilmslow Station and stop, it was evident that the enemy\r\nhad reopened the line from Crewe, and intended concentrating part of\r\ntheir reinforcements to the general advance. The facts that the enemy\r\nhad succeeded in cutting all the telegraph lines in the district, and\r\nhad now obtained complete control over the railway, were most alarming,\r\nand the outlook of the defenders was rendered doubly serious by the\r\nlarge force they were compelled to keep east of Stockport, and in the\r\nPeak district, to prevent the invaders getting round to attack\r\nManchester from the north.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the news of the disaster to the patrol, the commander of\r\nthe piquet at Appletree immediately sent information to the commander of\r\nthe piquet posted at the railway station at Cheadle Hulme; but by a\r\nstrange oversight, due no doubt to the excitement of the moment, sent no\r\nreport to the commander of the outposts. The infantry engaging the\r\nRussians on the embankment, though exhibiting most gallant courage, were\r\nso exposed that it was little wonder they were soon completely\r\nannihilated, only half a dozen escaping.\r\n\r\nThe enemy must have detrained a large number of troops at Wilmslow, for\r\nthe British cavalry scouts were quickly followed up by Cossacks and the\r\nTsar's Dragoons. Quickly the sentries between Heald Green and\r\nAppletree were driven back on their piquets, the latter extending in\r\nskirmishing order. Such a manoeuvre, however, proved fatal in the\r\ndarkness and on the heavy ploughed land over which they were fighting.\r\nAlas! very few succeeded in reaching the supports, and when they did,\r\nthey all fell back hurriedly on the reserves at Pimgate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATTLEFIELD OF MANCHESTER.]\r\n\r\nThen the commander of the piquet at Cheadle Hulme Station, finding that\r\nhe must inevitably be attacked by road and rail, set the station on\r\nfire, and with the assistance of the railway officials blew up a large\r\nportion of the permanent way with dynamite, thus cutting off the enemy's\r\nmeans of communication. This accomplished, he fell back upon his\r\nsupports at Adswood, and they, at about 2 A.M., retreated with the\r\nreserves to the embankment of the North-Western Railway which carries\r\nthe line from Stockport to Whaley Bridge, and took up a strong position\r\nto assist in the defence of Stockport.\r\n\r\nThe latter town was defended on three sides by railway embankments,\r\nwhich were now occupied by strong bodies of Regulars, with several\r\nMaxims. One embankment ran from the west boundary of the town to\r\nMiddlewood Junction, another from Middlewood to Marple, and a third from\r\nMarple to Mayercroft. Throughout the night the defenders were in hourly\r\nexpectation that an attack would be made upon their positions, with the\r\nobject of investing Stockport as a preliminary to the assault on the\r\ndefensive lines north of the Mersey; but the enemy apparently had other\r\nobjects, and the disaster to the British cavalry patrol on the Wilmslow\r\nroad was, unfortunately, followed by a second and more serious one. The\r\nCossacks and Dragoons that followed the British cavalry scouts overtook\r\nthem just as they had joined their reserves, a short distance beyond\r\nPimgate, about half-past two. A fierce fight ensued, and the force of\r\nBritish cavalry and infantry was gradually drawn into a\r\ncunningly-devised trap, and then there suddenly appeared a great force\r\nof Russians, who simply swept down upon them, slaughtering the whole of\r\nthem with brutal ferocity, not, however, before they had fought\r\ndesperately, and inflicted enormous loss upon the enemy.\r\n\r\nHaving totally annihilated that detachment of defenders, the Russians\r\nmarched into Cheadle, and, after sacking the little town, burned it,\r\ntogether with the Grange, the Print Works, the railway station, St.\r\nMary's Church, and a number of large mills.\r\n\r\nThe great army of the Tsar had bivouaced, reserving its strength for a\r\ndesperate dash upon Manchester. But the British outposts stood wakeful\r\nand vigilant, ready at any moment to sound the alarm. To those\r\nentrenched beyond the winding Mersey, soaked by the heavy rain, and\r\nspending the dark hours in anxiety, there came over the dismal country\r\nthe sound of distant rifle-firing mingling with the roll of the thunder.\r\nEre long they knew that every man would be fighting for his life against\r\nthe great hordes of invaders who would descend upon them swiftly and\r\nmercilessly. Across the country from the Peak away to Chester, the\r\nBriton bravely faced his foe, anxious and vigilant, awaiting\r\nbreathlessly the progress of events.\r\n\r\nThus passed the stormy, oppressive night, till the grey dawn of a\r\nfateful day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nMANCHESTER ATTACKED BY RUSSIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the first streak of daylight the anxious, excited crowds of men and\r\nwomen, surging up and down the principal streets of Manchester, were\r\nalarmed by the sounds of heavy firing. A terrible panic instantly\r\nensued. The battle had actually commenced!\r\n\r\nHalf-starved operatives, with pale, wan faces, stood in groups in\r\nDeansgate, Market Street, Piccadilly, and London Road, while men, armed\r\nwith any weapons they could obtain, rushed out along the main roads to\r\nthe south of the city to assist in its defence. Lancashire men exhibited\r\ncommendable patriotism, even though they had not hesitated to criticise\r\nthe administration of our War Department; for now at the critical hour\r\nnot a man flinched from his duty, both old and young taking up arms for\r\ntheir country's honour.\r\n\r\nDuring the eventful night at all approaches to the city from the south\r\nthe roads had been thrown into a state of hasty defence. A formidable\r\nbarricade had been constructed at a point in the Stretford Road close to\r\nthe Botanical Gardens to prevent the enemy from advancing up the Chester\r\nor Stretford New Roads; another was thrown up at the junction of\r\nChorlton Road, Withington Road, Upper Chorlton Road, and Moss Lane West;\r\na third opposite Rusholme Hall prevented any march up the Wilmslow Road;\r\nwhile others of minor strength blocked the Anson Road close to the Elms,\r\nthe London Road at Longsight, the Hyde Road opposite Belle Vue Prison,\r\nand at Ivy Place in the Ashton Old Road.\r\n\r\nThese had all been raised out of any materials that came to hand.\r\nBarrels, brick rubbish, planks, doors, flooring of houses hastily torn\r\nup, and scaffold poles lashed together; in fact, the barriers were huge\r\npiles of miscellaneous and portable articles, even furniture from\r\nneighbouring houses being utilised, while lengths of iron railings and\r\nwire torn from fences played an important part in these hastily-built\r\ndefences. Behind them, armed with rifles, shot-guns, pistols, knives,\r\nand any other weapon that came handiest, the men of Manchester waited,\r\nbreathlessly impatient in the expectation of attack.\r\n\r\nAs dawn spread bright and rosy, and the mist cleared from the low\r\nmeadows beside the Mersey, the distant firing was continuous, and the\r\none or two shells that fell and burst in the centre of the city were\r\nprecursory of an awful sanguinary struggle. Scarcely a person in that\r\ndensely populated area had slept that night, and the streets were\r\neverywhere full, the most exciting and heartrending scenes being\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\nA great crowd that assembled in Albert Square was addressed by the Mayor\r\nfrom the steps of the Town Hall, and urged to strain every muscle to\r\ndrive back the invaders, in order that the disaster at Birmingham should\r\nnot be repeated. Even as he spoke, in the interval of wild cheering and\r\nthe energetic singing of the National Anthem and \"Rule, Britannia,\" the\r\ndistant crackling of rifles and the low booming of field guns could be\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nIt was the din of battle--the catastrophe caused by the cunning spy Von\r\nBeilstein, who was still living in luxury in London, and who still posed\r\nas the friend of Geoffrey Engleheart and Violet Vayne!\r\n\r\nGeoffrey was still with the Volunteers assisting in the defence of\r\nLondon, but the French spy who had sent the forged orders to our Navy\r\nhad apparently made good his escape.\r\n\r\nHere, in Manchester, the sound of the guns aroused that patriotic\r\nenthusiasm latent in the heart of every Briton. True, they were weary,\r\nfamished, ill from lack of food, yet they were fiercely determined that\r\nthe invader should never tread their streets, nor should incendiaries\r\nburn or Russian artillery destroy their handsome buildings--monuments of\r\nEngland's wealth and greatness. In St. Peter's Square, at a mass meeting\r\nattended by nearly twelve thousand people, a demonstration was made\r\nagainst the enemy, and it was resolved that every man should act his\r\npart in the struggle, and that no quarter should be shown the legions of\r\nthe Tsar; while at another impromptu meeting held in Piccadilly, in the\r\nopen space opposite the Infirmary, the conduct of the Russians before\r\nBirmingham was denounced; and some speakers, using violent language,\r\nlashed their hearers into a frenzy of mad excitement, causing an eager\r\nrush to the barricades in readiness for the terrible fray.\r\n\r\nAs the sun shone out pale and yellow in the stormy sky, the fighting\r\nspread quickly down the Mersey banks from Haughton away to Flixton. It\r\nbecame fiercest around Stockport, and over the level pastures the white\r\nsmoke of rifles puffed from every bush, wall, and fence.\r\n\r\nThe Russians were the superior force, for, while all were trained\r\nsoldiers, not more than a third of the defenders had taken the Queen's\r\nshilling, and not more than half of them had ever had an hour's drill in\r\ntheir lives. They were simply volunteers who had found their own arms\r\nand banded for the defence of their homes.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers of the Tsar, trained under the most rigorous discipline,\r\nhad considerably improved in tactics, in drill, and in munitions of war\r\nsince the Crimea,--a fact overlooked by the majority of Britons,--and\r\nthey had now taken possession of every strategical position where\r\nbatteries might be established. After fierce fighting over Lyme Park\r\nacross to Norbury Hall, in which the Russians lost very heavily owing to\r\nthe British gun fire from the railway embankment, a great charge was\r\nmade by an enormous body of infantry, who succeeded, after several\r\nfutile attempts, in carrying the position, and driving the British\r\nartillerymen back to the road which runs from Stockport to Marple.\r\n\r\nThe embankment which thus fell into the hands of the Muscovite infantry\r\nformed one of the strongest defences of Stockport, therefore they at\r\nonce moved the guns up towards Davenport Station, and commenced shelling\r\nthe city with the defenders' own guns!\r\n\r\nThe panic caused in Stockport was awful, when without warning shells\r\ncommenced to explode in the crowded barricaded streets, but the Russians\r\nwere not allowed to have things their own way for long. The British\r\nbatteries on the opposite railway embankment between Heaton Norris and\r\nNew Mills formed up at the junction almost opposite Davenport, and\r\nopened a terrific fire upon the captured guns.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour this continued, and the Russians, standing in an\r\nexposed position right on the sky-line, were being swept away by British\r\nshells, when suddenly the enemy were joined by reinforcements, whereupon\r\na small force of British infantry, who had been brought quickly along,\r\nunperceived by the enemy from Marple, suddenly swarmed up the embankment\r\nat Norbury, and, charging along to the Russian position, added a strong\r\nrifle fire to that of their artillery.\r\n\r\nThe officer commanding the British batteries watched the infantry\r\nadvance through his field glass, and in a few minutes suddenly ceased\r\nhis fire, so as to allow the infantry to make the dash for which they\r\nwere preparing. A heliograph signal was flashed from the batteries, and\r\nthen, without hesitation, the order was given to charge.\r\n\r\nIt was a terribly exciting moment. If they succeeded they would in all\r\nprobability save Stockport. If they were driven back the town was\r\ndoomed.\r\n\r\nWith admirable pluck the British rushed upon the guns, and for a few\r\nminutes there was a fierce struggle hand to hand. Russians, although\r\nmaking a most desperate stand, were every moment being impaled on\r\nBritish bayonets, or, pierced by bullets, they rolled down the slopes\r\ninto ditches covered in stagnant slime. Hacked to pieces by the small\r\nbut gallant force of Britons, the enemy were forced at last to give in\r\nand retire, leaving more than half their number killed; but with\r\nadmirable tact, the fugitives were forced down the bank nearest the\r\nBritish batteries. Thus they fell into a trap, for as soon as they\r\nattempted to recover themselves, and make a dash to reorganise their\r\nline of communications, two British Maxims uttered their sharp rattle,\r\nand the whole force were simply mowed down where they stood.\r\n\r\nThe fight had been a most desperate one, but, thanks to the heroic\r\ncharge of the British infantry, Stockport was again safe, and the guns\r\nonce more in the hands of her defenders.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, fighting of the fiercest possible description was taking\r\nplace across the meadows lying between Norbury and Bramhall, and the\r\nRussians, unable to withstand the withering British fire, were gradually\r\nforced back to Cheadle Hulme, where they were surprised by the defenders\r\nand utterly routed. So great was the slaughter, that it is estimated\r\nthat in this engagement alone, after the recapture of the guns by the\r\nBritish, over 4000 Russians were shot down and 3000 taken prisoners!\r\n\r\nThe Russians, finding how desperate was the resistance, and how heavily\r\nthey were losing, quickly brought up strong reinforcements upon Cheadle,\r\nand, after a fiercely-contested conflict, succeeded in driving back the\r\nsmall British force, they being compelled to retreat back over the\r\nMersey to Parr's Wood and Didsbury, afterwards blowing up the bridges,\r\nand keeping up a hot fire from the bank, where a large body of\r\nVolunteers were already entrenched. By this means, although they were\r\nunable to save Cheadle from being burned, they succeeded, by reason of\r\nthe excellence of their position and the admirable tactics they\r\ndisplayed, in mowing down another 2000 of the Tsar's soldiers. In this\r\ninstance the laurels remained with a portion of the Manchester Volunteer\r\nBrigade, the effect of whose rifle fire was appalling.\r\n\r\nIt was now about ten o'clock, and the sky had cleared for a brilliant\r\nday. At Chapel-en-le-Frith a large detachment of Cossacks had been swept\r\naway by a body of British Hussars who had suddenly descended upon\r\nWhitehough, while almost at the same moment a British battery that had\r\nbeen hastily established on Chinley Churn succeeded in wiping out a\r\nbody of infantry that was advancing with all speed in the neighbourhood\r\nof Yeardsley Hall. But one of the most sanguinary portions of the battle\r\nwas the conflict which spread westward from Cheadle across to\r\nAltrincham, Lymm, and Warrington. Already Altrincham had fallen. The\r\nfine villas of wealthy Manchester tradesmen and manufacturers, deserted\r\nby their owners, had been entered by the uncouth Muscovites and sacked.\r\nEvery nook and corner had been searched for plate, jewellery, and money,\r\npaintings had been ruthlessly torn down, furniture broken and burned,\r\nand Russian troopers had made merry in many a handsome drawing-room. Old\r\nField Hall and Timperly Hall had both been ransacked and set on fire\r\nwith petroleum, while every house at Dunham Massey had been destroyed by\r\nincendiaries.\r\n\r\nElated over their successes, the Russians were collecting their forces\r\npreparatory to a decisive rush over the Mersey to Stretford, intending\r\nto take that place, and advance by that route upon Manchester. The\r\ndefenders, who had been warned of this through spies, awaited their\r\nchance, and suddenly, when the Russians least expected an attack, a body\r\nof British cavalry, backed by infantry, crossed the Mersey, and sweeping\r\ndown the level turnpike road to Sale, came upon their opponents before\r\nthey were aware of their presence. The effect of this was frightful. A\r\nsmall body of British Hussars, with some Lancashire Yeomanry, made a\r\nsplendid charge, exhibiting magnificent courage, and cut their way clean\r\nthrough the Russian lines with irresistible force; while the infantry,\r\nadvancing cautiously, and taking every advantage of the small cover\r\nafforded on that level country, poured forth a deadly rifle fire.\r\nIndeed, so gallant was this charge, that the Tsar's forces were almost\r\nannihilated. They endeavoured to make a stand near the cross-roads\r\nleading from Carrington Moss, but the rifle fire of the defenders was so\r\nheavy that they dropped by hundreds under the deadly rain of British\r\nbullets.\r\n\r\nThe disaster to the Russians being signalled back by them to their\r\nreserves at Tatton Park and around Knutsford, had the effect of bringing\r\nup an enormous force of infantry. Signallers were at work in all\r\ndirections, and those who watched the progress of the action found the\r\nnext two hours full of exciting moments. It was apparent at once that\r\nthe Russians had marked out Stretford as the gate by which they intended\r\nto enter Manchester, but they must have been misled by their spies as to\r\nthe strength of the defenders in this direction.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if they had surveyed the whole of the southern line defending\r\nthe city, they could not have discovered a point more strongly\r\nfortified; therefore it was a somewhat curious fact that they should\r\nhave concentrated their forces upon that part. Possibly it was because\r\nthey had formed an opinion by studying their Ordnance Maps--so\r\ngenerously provided for them by the British Department of Agriculture at\r\na cost of one shilling each--that, if they succeeded in breaking the\r\ndefence at Stretford, they would also secure the road running in a\r\ncircular direction up to Barton, by which means they could enter\r\nManchester by way of Eccles, Pendleton, and Salford at the same time as\r\nthe march through Trafford. Such a design was, of course, cleverly\r\nplanned. It must be admitted that, from a strategical point of view, the\r\ntaking of Stretford would mean the fall of Manchester, a fact which the\r\nRussian commanding officer had not overlooked.\r\n\r\nBut the soldiers of the Tsar had reckoned without their hosts. They only\r\nsaw along the Mersey a thin and apparently weak line of defence, a\r\nmassing of defenders without undue ostentation and without any\r\nparticular show of strength. A balloon sent up by the Russians to\r\nreconnoitre from Sale had been fired at and brought down by the\r\ndefenders, but with this exception scarcely a shot had been fired north\r\nof the Mersey. Britons were watching and waiting. Their foe, ridiculing\r\nthe idea that a town like Manchester, almost utterly devoid of positions\r\nwhereon batteries might be established, could be successfully defended,\r\ntherefore kept up a desultory fire upon the British detachment that had\r\nswept away their advance guard, in the meantime covering the massing of\r\ntheir enormous force. This latter consisted of Cossacks, guards,\r\ninfantry, artillery, and two companies of engineers, with pontoon\r\nsections, as well as a ballooning party and two field hospitals.\r\n\r\nThe British detachment that had crossed the river were, however, unaware\r\nof the enemy's intention until too late. The manoeuvres of the Russians\r\nwere being watched by a British balloon sent up from Old Trafford, but\r\nthe signals made by the aeronaut were unfortunately unobserved by the\r\nparty, so desperately were they fighting; otherwise a disaster which\r\nbefell them on the sudden rush of the enemy towards the river might\r\npossibly have been averted. However, no blame could be attached to the\r\nofficer in charge of the detachment. The men acted their part bravely,\r\nand displayed that courage of which the Briton speaks with justifiable\r\npride, even though, alas! they fell, every one of them fighting till the\r\nlast, their bodies being afterwards frightfully mangled by horses'\r\nhoofs, as hundreds of Cossacks rode over them. Not a man of that party\r\nescaped, but each one had once more shown the world what pluck and\r\ncourage could accomplish, and had gone to his grave as a sacrifice for\r\nhis country and his Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nGALLANT DEEDS BY CYCLISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoon came and went. The fighting grew fiercer around Manchester, and the\r\nexcitement more intense within the barricaded, starving city. Through\r\nthe wildly agitated crowds of women of all classes, from manufacturers'\r\nwives to factory girls, who moved up and down Deansgate, Market Street,\r\nand many other principal thoroughfares, feverishly anxious for the\r\nsafety of their husbands and brothers manning the improvised defences,\r\nrumours of terrible disaster spread like wildfire, and caused loud\r\nwailing and lamentation.\r\n\r\nNow rumour told of huge British successes away beyond the Mersey, a\r\nreport which elated the pale-faced hungry ones, but this being followed\r\nquickly by a further report that a force of the defenders had been cut\r\nup and utterly annihilated outside Eccles, the cheering died away, and\r\ngive place to deep, long-drawn sighs and murmurings of despair.\r\n\r\nUpon the dusty, perspiring throngs the hot noonday sun beat down\r\nmercilessly, the low rumbling of artillery sounded gradually closer and\r\nmore distinct, and the smoke of burning buildings in Sale and Altrincham\r\nslowly ascending hung in the clear sky a black ominous cloud.\r\n\r\nBy about two o'clock the line of defence south of the Mersey had been\r\nnearly all withdrawn, leaving, however, the defending line running\r\nsouth-east of Stockport to Buxton and the Peak. Although Cheadle had\r\nfallen into the enemy's hands, an English battery, established near\r\nthe railway at Bamford, commanded the road from Cheadle to Stockport,\r\nand British infantry, supported by artillery, were strongly entrenched\r\nfrom Bramhall Moor through Norbury, Poynton, Wardsend, Booth Green, and\r\nBollington, then turning east through Macclesfield Forest to Buxton.\r\nThis line was being hourly strengthened, and although not strong enough\r\nto take the offensive, it was too strong for the Russians to attack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GALLANT STAND BY CYCLISTS IN PARR WOOD.]\r\n\r\nAll the bridges over the Mersey, from Glazebrook to Stockport, had been\r\nprepared for demolition, but it was not intended to carry this out\r\nexcept as a last resource. Cavalry and cyclist scouts who were left on\r\nthe south of the Mersey had withdrawn across the bridges, after\r\nexchanging shots with the skirmishers of the advance guards of the enemy\r\nwho quickly lined the banks. The bridges north of Cheadle were then\r\nblown up, and the defenders were well posted in Parr Wood, near where it\r\nwas believed the enemy would attempt to ford the river. The Russians\r\ncontented themselves with exchanging a few shots with the defenders\r\nuntil half an hour later, when some of their batteries had been\r\nestablished, and then the passage of the Mersey at Northenden was\r\ncommenced, under cover of the guns of the Russians near the Convalescent\r\nHospital, north of Cheadle.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Russian scouts approached the river three British\r\noutposts could be seen in the wood. They were, however, driven in by\r\nsome Cossacks, who forded the river and attempted to enter the wood, but\r\nwere all immediately killed by hidden skirmishers. The Russian engineers\r\nwere meanwhile busy building a pontoon bridge, which they soon\r\ncompleted, and they then crossed after a short opposition, rapidly\r\ndeploying to right and left in order to surround Didsbury.\r\n\r\nThis, the first force to cross the Mersey, consisted of two battalions\r\nof the Kazan Regiment and two battalions of the Vladimir, with two\r\n9-pounder and one 6-pounder field batteries and 100 cavalry. Didsbury\r\nhad been put in a state of hasty defence, and was held by two battalions\r\nof the defenders, who also established a Volunteer battery at Bank\r\nHall, and lined the railway embankment in force as far as\r\nChorlton-with-Hardy.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's battery at the Convalescent Home had rendered the wood\r\nalmost untenable, but it was soon silenced by the well-directed fire of\r\nthe British Volunteer battery, and the wood was then re-entered by the\r\ndefenders. By this time, however, a large number of the enemy had taken\r\nup positions in it, and the British were once more gradually driven\r\nback.\r\n\r\nOne section, consisting of six cyclists, with a light machine gun\r\nmounted on a double cycle, was told off under Sergeant Irons of the\r\nRoyal Lancaster, to defend a junction of two paths about half-way\r\nthrough the dense wood, and as the latter was still occupied by the\r\ndefenders, the enemy could only make slow progress, and the cavalry\r\ncould only move by the paths.\r\n\r\nIrons, taking advantage of a bend in the path, dismounted his men, who,\r\nhaving drawn up their cycles under cover, were formed up each side of\r\nthe road to support the gun. About thirty Russian dragoons, with their\r\ninfantry, who were working through the wood, were soon upon them, and,\r\nseeing such a small force barring the way, the cavalry charged.\r\n\r\nThey, however, met with such a terribly hot reception that only two\r\nreached the guns, and these were immediately shot. The stand made by\r\nthese seven men was a most noteworthy instance of the indomitable\r\ncourage of the defenders. In those critical moments they remained calm\r\nand collected, obeying the orders of their sergeant as coolly as if they\r\nhad been drilling in the barrack square. But their position was one of\r\nmomentarily increasing peril, for bullets whistled about them, and the\r\nforce against them was an overwhelming one. The Russian horses and men\r\nwho had fallen blocked the road, and Irons therefore gave the order to\r\nfall in, as the sound of firing had now drawn many of the enemy's\r\nskirmishers towards the spot.\r\n\r\nIrons then re-formed his squad, one of whom had been shot and another\r\nwounded, and, taking the wounded man with them, retired. Just as they\r\nwere moving off the corporal was wounded in the shoulder, and Irons\r\nhimself received a bullet in the left arm. About two hundred yards\r\nnearer Didsbury there was a clearing, with farm buildings on both sides\r\nof the road, and these had been loopholed and occupied by a small force\r\nof Volunteers. Irons, sending the wounded man on to Didsbury, remained\r\nhere with his gun, and a few minutes later the position was vigorously\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\nThe conflict which ensued was of the fiercest description. The mere\r\nhandful of defenders fought with such desperate courage that the great\r\nbody of Russians which surrounded them were from the first moment\r\ngradually swept away by the steady and precise fire from the farm.\r\nAround the buildings the enemy swarmed in overwhelming numbers, but\r\nevery man who showed himself was promptly picked off by Britons shooting\r\nalmost as coolly as if they were competing for prizes at Bisley.\r\n\r\nSergeant Irons' small machine gun, with its single barrel, rattled out\r\ncontinuously, shedding its rain of lead in all directions, while from\r\nmuzzles of Martini rifles peeping over walls and from windows there came\r\na continuous stream of bullets, which played frightful havoc with the\r\nfoe. Within the first ten minutes two men of the defending force had\r\nbeen shot dead and one wounded; still, their comrades never lost heart,\r\nfor they were determined that their position should never fall into the\r\nenemy's hands. The Russian officer who was directing the operations of\r\nthe attacking party rose and shouted in Russian to encourage his men,\r\nbut in a moment an English bullet struck him, and, with a loud cry, he\r\nfell forward over the body of a dragoon, shot through the heart.\r\n\r\nThe stand the cyclists and their companions made was unparalleled. They\r\nfought on heroically, knowing the importance of the position they held,\r\nand how, if it were taken, other and more serious British casualties\r\nmust follow. Firing steadily and with caution, they displayed such\r\nbravery that even the Russians themselves were compelled to secretly\r\nadmire them; and at last, after nearly half an hour's desperate\r\nfighting, the Tsar's soldiers found themselves so terribly cut up that\r\nthey were forced to retire, leaving more than half their number dead\r\nand many wounded.\r\n\r\nWhile this had been in progress, the British battery had totally\r\ndestroyed the Russian pontoon, and thus all means of retreat for this\r\nportion of the invading force were cut off. About ten thousand men had\r\ncrossed the river at this point, and although they had deployed at\r\nfirst, they had all been gradually driven into the wood by the fire from\r\nthe railway embankment.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the pontoon was destroyed, the British commenced to advance\r\nthrough the wood, slowly driving back the Russians, who then endeavoured\r\nto make for Stretford along the north bank of the river; but on seeing\r\ntheir intention a brigade of defenders was immediately pushed along the\r\nrailway, and two regiments of cavalry were hurried down the road to\r\nChorlton.\r\n\r\nThese succeeded in heading the enemy, and, suddenly swooping down, they\r\ndestroyed the rest of the Cossacks who had escaped from the wood, as\r\nwell as the remainder of the force who had attacked the farm.\r\n\r\nAnother British battery was then hurried forward, and after a stubborn\r\nfight the remainder of the invaders who had crossed surrendered.\r\n\r\nIn this attack alone the Russians lost in killed and wounded 200 cavalry\r\nand nearly 2000 infantry and artillery, while Stretford and Stockport\r\nstill remained safe. But along the long line east and west the battle\r\nraged with increasing fierceness. The conflict was a terrible one on\r\nevery hand.\r\n\r\nThe town of Lymm had been sacked, and was now burning, while hundreds of\r\nunoffending men, women, and children living in the quiet Cheshire\r\nvillages had been wantonly massacred by the Muscovites. The latter were,\r\nhowever, now suffering well-merited punishment, for in this bloody\r\nbattle they were falling dead in hundreds.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Eagle was at last being forced to bite the dust!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nGREAT BATTLE ON THE MERSEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long blazing day was one of many battles and much toilsome combat.\r\n\r\nFighting spread over a front of nearly nine miles, and during the\r\nengagement one wing of the Russians was swung across three miles. Hour\r\nafter hour the tremendous warfare raged between the armies of Queen\r\nVictoria and the Tsar, and the bloodshed was everywhere terrible.\r\n\r\nSmall parties of the Russian Telegraph Corps had ferried over the Ship\r\nCanal and the Mersey near Latchford, and wires were run out, and posts\r\nestablished connecting the headquarters at Altrincham, on the south of\r\nthe river, with the well-advanced guard stations on the Liverpool Road\r\ntowards Manchester at Woolstone, Hollinfare, and Lower Irlam.\r\n\r\nSending forth a huge division of infantry upon his left, and three\r\nbrigades of cavalry in the centre, the Russian General struck hard at\r\nthe British line between Stretford and Chorlton-with-Hardy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, beyond Ashton-on-Mersey the battle was also growing in\r\nintensity, and rifle and cannon were noisily engaged. A strong force of\r\nRussian infantry was at once pushed across to Partington, where they\r\nsucceeded in crossing the Ship Canal and the Mersey, subsequently\r\njoining their advance guard at Lower Irlam.\r\n\r\nThe British reserves at Newton-in-Makerfield, however, swept down upon\r\nthem, and a terrible fight quickly ensued. The defenders advanced very\r\nsteadily by section rushes, keeping under good firing discipline as they\r\nwent, and the enemy were driven on towards Flixton, where they were\r\nsimply swept away by the 12-pounder batteries established there, while\r\nat the same time their wires crossing the Mersey were cut, and\r\ncommunication with their headquarters thus interrupted.\r\n\r\nWhile this was in progress, another and more important attack was being\r\nmade on Stretford. The heavy artillery fire and the affairs of outposts\r\nin the earlier stages of the battle had been followed by a\r\ncarefully-regulated long-range fire of infantry on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe tactics the Russians had displayed were as follows:--They had\r\ngradually developed their infantry in front of the Stretford position,\r\nand brought their pontoons in readiness for a dash over the river. Then,\r\nafter some tentative movements, designed to feel the strength of our\r\nforces massed at this important point, they apparently determined to\r\ncarry it at any cost.\r\n\r\nOn their right flank the enemy were losing very heavily. A telegraphic\r\nmessage received at Altrincham gave the headquarters alarming news of\r\nconstant reverses. A strong force of infantry marching along the banks\r\nof the Etherow from Compstall, intending to get to Hyde by way of\r\nMottram and Godley Junction, had been attacked by British infantry and a\r\ncouple of 9-pounders, and totally annihilated; while at the same time,\r\nabout a thousand men attacking a British battery on the hill at\r\nCharlesworth had been cut up and forced to retreat, being followed by\r\nsome Lancers right down to Ludworth Houses, where they were nearly all\r\nkilled or wounded.\r\n\r\nIndeed, times without number during that memorable day the Russians made\r\nfierce attacks upon our positions on the edge of the Peak district, but\r\non each occasion they were hurled back with fearful loss by the thin\r\nline of defenders holding the high ground.\r\n\r\nA battery we had established on the crown of the hill at Werneth was\r\ncharged again and again by Cossacks and Dragoons, but our men,\r\ndisplaying cool courage at the critical moments, fought desperately, and\r\nmowed down the foe in a manner that was remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe Russians, having decided to carry Stretford, were making vigorous\r\ndemonstrations towards the Peak, and in the direction of Flixton, in\r\norder to distract our attention. They occupied us at many points in the\r\nvast semicircle, and by thus engaging us all along the line, endeavoured\r\napparently to prevent us from reinforcing the point at Stretford which\r\nthey intended gaining. Both invaders and defenders gradually extended in\r\norder to meet outflanking movements, and this was the cause of another\r\nsudden British success. It was a foregone conclusion that such an\r\nextension would exceed the limits of defensive power on one side or the\r\nother, and then blows would be struck with the object of breaking the\r\ntoo extended line.\r\n\r\nWhat occurred is, perhaps, best related by one of the special\r\ncorrespondents of the _Daily News_, who, in his account of the battle,\r\npublished two days later, said--\r\n\r\n\"About three o'clock I was at Barton with the force of infantry who were\r\nholding the road to Warrington, when we unexpectedly received\r\ntelegraphic information from headquarters of a rapid extension of the\r\nenemy's left flank. A brigade which I accompanied was pushed on at once\r\ndown to Hollinfare, where we reinforced those who had been so successful\r\nin cutting up the enemy at Lower Irlam half an hour before. We then\r\nextended along the Liverpool Road, past Warrington, as far as Widnes. I\r\nremained with a small detachment at Hollinfare awaiting developments,\r\nwhen suddenly we were informed that the enemy had thrown a pontoon\r\nbridge over the Mersey at its confluence with the Bollin, and that a\r\ngreat body of infantry, with machine guns, had left Lymm, where they had\r\nbeen lying inactive, and were already crossing. There were not more than\r\none hundred of us, mostly men of the Loyal Lancashire from Preston and a\r\nfew of the Manchester Regiment; but at the word of command we dashed\r\ndown the road for nearly a mile, and then leaving it, doubled across the\r\nfields to Rixton Old Hall, where we obtained cover.\r\n\r\n\"The Russians had chosen the most advantageous spot they could find to\r\ncross, for on the opposite bank there was a small thick wood, and in\r\nthis they remained quite concealed until they suddenly dashed out and\r\ngot across. Numbers had already reached our side and were deploying,\r\nwhen our rifles spoke out sharply, and, judging from the manner in which\r\nthe enemy were exposed, our fire was quite unexpected. About thirty of\r\nour men, kneeling behind a wall, kept up a vigorous fire, emptying their\r\nmagazines with excellent effect upon the grey-coats swarming over the\r\nimprovised bridge.\r\n\r\n\"Still it was impossible to keep them back, for the force effecting a\r\npassage was very much larger than we had anticipated.\r\n\r\n\"A few minutes later, having ascertained the extent of the attack, our\r\nsignallers opened communication with Higher Irlam, and the information\r\nwas conveyed on to Barton, whence the heliograph flashed the news down\r\nto Stretford.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly, however, in the midst of a shady clump of trees there was a\r\nloud rattle and continuous flashing. The enemy had brought a\r\n10-barrelled Nordenfelt into play, and it was raining bullets upon us at\r\nthe rate of a thousand a minute!\r\n\r\n\"The wall behind which I was crouching was struck by a perfect hail of\r\nlead, and there was a loud whistling about my ears that was particularly\r\ndisconcerting. Nevertheless our men had in their sudden dash for the\r\ndefence secured an excellent position, and only three were killed and\r\nfive wounded by this sudden outburst.\r\n\r\n\"The struggle during the next few minutes was the most desperate I have\r\never witnessed. At the moment of peril our men displayed magnificent\r\npluck. They seemed utterly unconcerned at their imminent danger, and lay\r\nor crouched, firing independently with calm precision. A dozen or so\r\nfell wounded, however, and a sergeant who knelt next to me, and who was\r\nshooting through a hole in the wall, was shot through the heart, and\r\nfell dead while in the act of making an observation to me.\r\n\r\n\"The men who had attacked us were a fierce-looking set, mostly composed\r\nof Tchuwakes and Mordwa from the central district of the Volga, and\r\nrenowned as among the best infantry that the Tsar can command.\r\n\r\n\"Rifles bristled from every bit of cover around us, and it was really\r\nmarvellous that we scored such success. Indeed, it was only by reason of\r\nthe courageous conduct of every individual man that the successful stand\r\nwas made against such overwhelming numbers. We knew that if the enemy\r\nforced the passage and annihilated us, they would then be enabled to\r\noutflank our force, and get round to Eccles and Pendlebury--a disaster\r\nwhich might result in the rapid investment of Manchester. Therefore we\r\nfought on, determined to do our very utmost to stem the advancing tide\r\nof destroyers.\r\n\r\n\"Time after time our rifles rattled, and time after time the deadly\r\nNordenfelt sent its hail of bullets around us. Presently, however, we\r\nheard increased firing on our right, and then welcome signals reached us\r\nfrom Martinscroft Green. We greeted them with loud cheering, for a force\r\nof our infantry and cavalry had returned along the road from Warrington,\r\nand, working in extended order, were bearing down upon the foe.\r\n\r\n\"We ceased firing in that direction, and ere long we had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing the enemy's pontoon blown up, and then, with\r\ntheir retreat cut off, they became demoralised, and were driven into the\r\nopen, where we picked them off so rapidly that scarcely one man of the\r\n1500 who had set his foot upon the Lancashire bank survived.\r\n\r\n\"From first to last our men fought magnificently. The whole engagement\r\nwas a brilliant and almost unequalled display of genuine British\r\nbravery, and all I can hope is that the defenders of London will act\r\ntheir part with equal courage when the decisive struggle comes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF THE VANQUISHED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this vigorous attack on the right flank was in progress, the enemy\r\nmade a sudden dash upon Stretford.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the town itself--or rather suburb--lies but a short distance\r\nfrom the Mersey, and the turnpike road runs straight away over the river\r\nthrough Sale and Altrincham to Northwich. At the end of the town nearest\r\nthe river a road leading down from Barton joins the main road, and at\r\nthe junction is a large red-brick modern hotel, the Old Cock, while\r\nadjoining is the Manchester Tramway Company's stable and terminus. At a\r\nlittle distance behind lies a high embankment, which carries the railway\r\nfrom Manchester to Liverpool, while the Mersey itself, though not wide,\r\nhas steep banks with earthworks thrown up to prevent floods. Hence the\r\nforce holding this position found ready-made defences which were now of\r\nthe utmost value.\r\n\r\nThe defenders here included three batteries of Royal Artillery, one\r\nbattalion of the Manchester Regiment, the 2nd Volunteer Battalion of the\r\nsame regiment, and one of the Lancashire Fusiliers, a field company of\r\nEngineers, half the 14th (King's) Hussars with their machine gun\r\nsection, and a company of signallers. Trenches had been dug at various\r\npoints, and earthworks thrown up all along the line from Chorlton over\r\nto Flixton. Across the junction of the two roads opposite the Old Cock a\r\ngreat barricade had been constructed, and behind this was a powerful\r\nbattery that commanded the level country away towards Altrincham. The\r\nbridges carrying the road and railway over the river had both been\r\ndemolished by engineers, and many other precautions had been taken to\r\nprevent the enemy forcing a passage across.\r\n\r\nAt last, with a swiftness that was surprising, the expected assault was\r\nmade. Its strength was terrific, and the carnage on both sides\r\nappalling.\r\n\r\nThe first dash across was effected by the Russians from the rifle range\r\nnear Old Hall, and this was rapidly followed by another from the bank\r\nopposite the battery at Stretford, while further down a third attack was\r\nmade near Mersey House, close to Ashton.\r\n\r\nOf the three, the strongest, of course, was that upon Stretford. The\r\nenemy had, by a good deal of neat manoeuvring, brought their main body\r\nwithin the triangle bounded on the one side by the road from Cheadle to\r\nAltrincham, on the second by the road from the latter place to the\r\nriver, and the third by the river itself.\r\n\r\nPontoons were floated at many points, and while some cavalry forded the\r\nriver, infantry and artillery rapidly crossed in the face of a terrific\r\nfire which was pouring upon them.\r\n\r\nSmokeless powder being used, the positions of the invaders were not\r\nobscured, and it could be seen that the British were effecting terrible\r\nexecution. Hundreds of the foe who were in the act of crossing were\r\npicked off, and shells falling upon the pontoons destroyed them. The\r\nlatter, however, were quickly replaced, and the force of the Tsar, by\r\nreason of the overwhelming numbers that had hurled themselves upon\r\nStretford, succeeded, after a desperately-contested fight, in breaking\r\nthe line of defence between Chorlton-with-Hardy and Fallowfield, and\r\nadvancing by short rushes upon Manchester.\r\n\r\nBut the British infantry in their trenches behaved splendidly, and made\r\nthe roads from Old Hall at Sale right along to Partington quite\r\nuntenable, so the continuous advance of the enemy cost them very dearly.\r\n\r\nRussian shells bursting in Stretford killed and injured large numbers\r\nof the defenders. Two of them struck the Old Cock in rapid succession,\r\nalmost completely demolishing it, but the debris was quickly manned, and\r\nrifles soon spoke from its ruined walls. Again, a shell exploding in the\r\nlarge tram stables, set a hay store on fire, and this burned furiously,\r\nwhile away in the centre of the town the Public Library and a number of\r\nshops in the vicinity had also been ignited in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nAt last the thousands of grey-coats swarming over the country fell in\r\nsuch enormous numbers upon the British rifle pits on the Mersey bank,\r\nthat the first line of defence was at length utterly broken down; but in\r\ndoing this the enemy's front had become much exposed, whereupon the\r\nMaxims on the railway embankment between the river and Barton suddenly\r\nburst forth a perfect hail of bullets, and in a short time a whole\r\ndivision of Russian infantry, cavalry, and artillery had been literally\r\nswept out of existence.\r\n\r\nThe batteries down in the Stretford Road, combined with those on the\r\nembankment, had up to this moment played greater havoc with the foe than\r\nany other. The men of the Manchester Regiment, both Regulars and\r\nVolunteers, were displaying the greatest coolness; but unfortunately the\r\nLancashire Fusiliers and the Loyal North Lancashire, who had manned the\r\ntrenches, had been partially annihilated, the majority lying dead, their\r\nbodies scattered over the level fields and roads. Yet, notwithstanding\r\nthe strenuous opposition of the British batteries at this point, the\r\nRussians were bringing up huge reinforcements from Altrincham, Cheadle,\r\nand Northenden, and by establishing strong batteries commanding\r\nStretford, they at last, about five o'clock, succeeded in killing nearly\r\nhalf the gallant defenders, and driving back the survivors up the Barton\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\nThe tide of grey-coats rushing onward, captured the British guns, and\r\nalthough the batteries on the railway embankment still held out, and the\r\nenemy suffered heavily from their Maxims, yet they pressed on into\r\nStretford town, and commenced to sack it. Messrs. Williams, Deacon's\r\nBank, was entered, the safes blown open, and large sums in gold and\r\nnotes abstracted, shops were entered and looted, and houses ransacked\r\nfor jewellery.\r\n\r\nThus Stretford fell.\r\n\r\nIts streets ran with blood; and on, over the bodies of its brave\r\ndefenders, the hordes of the Great White Tsar marched towards\r\nManchester.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the British batteries on the railway embankment had also\r\nfallen into the hands of the Russians, who were now driving the\r\nsurvivors over towards Barton. They did not, however, retreat without a\r\nmost desperate resistance. A row of thatched and white-washed cottages\r\nat the bend of the road they held for a long time, emptying their\r\nmagazine rifles with deadly effect upon their pursuers, but at last they\r\nwere driven north, and half an hour later joined their comrades who had\r\nmassed at Barton, but who had been attacked in great force and fallen\r\nback in good order to Pendleton.\r\n\r\nBy this time the enemy, having pierced the line of outposts, had\r\noccupied Barton and Eccles. At the former place they had set on fire a\r\nnumber of factories, and out of mere desire to cause as much damage to\r\nproperty as possible, they had blown up both the bridge that carried the\r\nroad over the Ship Canal, and also destroyed the magnificent swinging\r\naqueduct which carried the Bridgewater Canal over the other.\r\n\r\nThis great triumph of engineering--one of the most successful feats of\r\nthe decade--was blown into the air by charges of gun-cotton, and now lay\r\nacross the Ship Canal a heap of fallen masonry and twisted iron\r\ncantilevers, while the water from the Bridgewater Canal was pouring out\r\nin thousands of tons, threatening to flood the surrounding district, and\r\nthe church opposite had been wrecked by the terrific force of the\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nA frightful panic had been caused in Manchester by these reverses. The\r\nscenes in the streets were indescribable. At the barricades, however,\r\nthe enemy met with a desperate resistance.\r\n\r\nThree great columns were marching on Manchester at that moment. The\r\nfirst, having broken the line of defence near Fallowfield, divided into\r\ntwo divisions; one, advancing up the Wilmslow Road, stormed the great\r\nbarricade opposite Rusholme Hall, while the other appeared on the\r\nWithington Road, and commenced to engage the defences that had been\r\nthrown across Moss Lane and Chorlton Road. The second column advanced to\r\nwhere Eccles Old Road joins Broad Street at Pendleton; and the third,\r\nsweeping along up the Stretford Road, met with a terrific resistance at\r\nthe Botanic Gardens at Trafford, the walls of which, on either side of\r\nthe road, were loopholed and manned by infantry and artillery; while\r\nopposite, the Blind Asylum was held by a regiment of infantry, and a\r\nstrong barricade, with a battery of 12-pounders, had been established a\r\nlittle further towards the city, at the junction of the Chester and\r\nStretford New Roads.\r\n\r\nThe enemy advanced here in enormous force; but, seeing the formidable\r\ndefences, a number of cavalry and infantry turned off along the Trafford\r\nRoad, blew up the bridge of the Ship Canal in order to prevent a\r\npursuing force of British cavalry from following, and after setting fire\r\nto the great dock warehouses and crowd of idle ships, continued along to\r\nEccles New Road, where, however, they were met by another force of our\r\nHussars, and totally routed and cut up.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the tide of battle turned. It was already half-past\r\nfive, and the sun was sinking when the Russian forces prepared for their\r\nfinal onslaught. Cossacks and Dragoons charged again and again, and\r\ninfantry with bayonets fixed rushed onward to the barricades in huge\r\ngrey legions, only to be met by a sweeping rain of British bullets,\r\nwhich filled the roads with great heaps of dead. In these defences,\r\nrendered doubly strong by the patriotic action of the stalwart civilians\r\nof Manchester, the invaders could make no breach, and before every one\r\nof them they fell in thousands.\r\n\r\nThe men in the entrenchments saw the foe were falling back, and found\r\nthe attack growing weaker. Then signals were made, and they raised a\r\nlong hearty cheer when the truth was flashed to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIANS ATTACKING THE BARRICADE IN STRETFORD ROAD,\r\nMANCHESTER.]\r\n\r\nThe news was inspiriting, and they fought on with redoubled energy, for\r\nthey knew that the great body of reserves from Ashton-under-Lyne, Hyde,\r\nand Compstall, as well as those who had been occupying the hills on the\r\nedge of the Peak, had been pushed right past Stretford to Barton, and\r\nwere now advancing like a huge fan, outflanking the Russians and\r\nattacking them in their rear.\r\n\r\nThe British tactics were excellent, for while the invaders were attacked\r\nby cavalry and infantry on the one side, the defenders manning the\r\nbarricades made a sudden sortie, cutting their way into them with\r\nbayonet rushes which they could not withstand, and which had a terribly\r\nfatal effect.\r\n\r\nThe Tsar's forces, unable to advance or retreat, and being thus\r\ncompletely surrounded, still fought on, and as they refused to\r\nsurrender, were literally massacred by thousands by British troops,\r\nwhile many guns and horses were captured, thousands of rounds of\r\nammunition seized, and many men taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe fight in that evening hour was the most fiercely contested of any\r\nduring that day. The fate of Manchester was in the hands of our gallant\r\nsoldiers, who, although necessarily losing heavily before such an\r\nenormous army, behaved with a courage that was magnificent, and which\r\nwas deserving the highest commendation that could be bestowed.\r\n\r\nAs dusk gathered into darkness, the enemy were being forced back towards\r\nthe Mersey over the roads they had so recently travelled, but still\r\nfighting, selling their lives dearly. The highways and fields were\r\nstrewn with their dead and dying, for while infantry fired into their\r\nfront from the cover of houses and walls, our cavalry, with whirling\r\nsabres, fell upon them and hacked them to pieces. Neither Cossacks nor\r\nDragoons proved a match for our Hussars, Lancers, and Yeomanry, and even\r\nin face of the machine guns which the Russians brought into play in an\r\nendeavour to break the line and escape, our infantry dashed on with\r\ngrand and magnificent charges, quickly seizing the Nordenfelts, turning\r\ntheir own guns against them, and letting loose a fire that mowed down\r\nhundreds.\r\n\r\nAcross the neighbouring country our forces swept in good attack\r\nformation, and all along that great line, nearly six miles in length,\r\nthe slaughter of Russians was frightful.\r\n\r\nIn the falling gloom fire flashed from the muzzles of rifles, cannon,\r\nand machine guns, and far above the terrible din sounded shrill cries of\r\npain and hoarse shouts of despair as the great Army that had devastated\r\nour beloved country with fire and sword was gradually annihilated. In\r\nthose roads in the south of the city the scenes of bloodshed were awful,\r\nas a force of over 20,000 Russians were slaughtered because they would\r\nnot yield up their arms.\r\n\r\nOutside Stretford a last desperate stand was made, but ere long some\r\nBritish cavalry came thundering along, and cut them down in a frightful\r\nmanner, while about the same time a Russian flying column was\r\nannihilated over at Davy-Hulme; away at Carrington a retreating brigade\r\nof infantry which had escaped over the river was suddenly pounced upon\r\nby the defenders and slaughtered; and at Altrincham the enemy's\r\nheadquarters were occupied, and the staff taken prisoners. Ere the\r\nRussian General could be forced to surrender, however, he placed a\r\nrevolver to his head, and in full view of a number of his officers, blew\r\nhis brains out.\r\n\r\nThen, when the moon shone out from behind a dark bank of cloud just\r\nbefore midnight, she shed her pale light upon the wide battlefield on\r\nboth sides of the Mersey, whereon lay the bodies of no fewer than 30,000\r\nRussians and 12,000 British, while 40,000 Russians and 16,000 British\r\nlay wounded, nearly 10,000 Russians having been disarmed and marched\r\ninto the centre of the city as prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe victory had only been achieved at the eleventh hour by dint of great\r\ncourage and forethought, and being so swift and effectual it was\r\nmagnificent.\r\n\r\nManchester was safe, and the public rejoicings throughout that night\r\nwere unbounded.\r\n\r\nThe loss of life was too awful for reflection, for 12,000 of Britain's\r\nheroes--men who had won the battle--were lying with their white lifeless\r\nfaces upturned to the twinkling stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK III_\r\n\r\n_THE VICTORY_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nA SHABBY WAYFARER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Sussex the situation was now most critical. The struggle between the\r\nFrench invaders and the line of Volunteers defending London was long and\r\ndesperate, but our civilian soldiers were bearing their part bravely,\r\nshowing how Britons could fight, and day after day repelling the\r\nrepeated assaults with a vigour that at once proved their efficiency.\r\n\r\nThree days after the battle at Manchester had been fought and won, a man\r\nwith slouching gait and woeful countenance, attired in a cheap suit of\r\nshabby grey, stood on the steps of the Granton Hotel, at Granton, and\r\nwith his hands thrust into his pockets gazed thoughtfully out over the\r\nbroad waters of the Firth of Forth, to where the Fifeshire hills loomed\r\ndark upon the horizon. Slowly his keen eyes wandered away eastward to\r\nthe open sea, an extensive view of which he obtained from the flight of\r\nsteps whereon he stood, and then with a sigh of disappointment he\r\nbuttoned his coat, and, grasping his stick, descended, and walked at a\r\nleisurely pace along the road through Newhaven to Leith.\r\n\r\n\"To-night. To-night at sundown!\" he muttered to himself, as he bent his\r\nhead to the wind.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily he placed his hand to his hip to reassure himself that a\r\nletter he carried was still safe.\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" he continued, \"I declare I feel quite timid to-night. Everything\r\nis so quiet here; the houses look deserted, and everybody seems to have\r\nleft the place. Surely they can have no suspicion, and--and if they had?\r\nWhat does it matter?--eh, what?\"\r\n\r\nQuickening his pace, he passed down the long, quaint street of Newhaven,\r\nlined on each side by ancient fishermen's cottages, and then, crossing\r\nthe railway, passed under the wall of Leith Fort, whereon a couple of\r\nsentries were pacing. Glancing up at the two artillerymen, with the\r\nhalf-dozen obsolete guns behind them, and their background of\r\ngrass-grown mounds and buildings, the wayfarer smiled. He was thinking\r\nhow different would be the scene at this spot ere long.\r\n\r\nLeith Fort was a sort of fortified back-garden. The railway ran close to\r\nthe sea, parallel with which was the highway, and upon higher ground at\r\nthe back was a block of buildings, before which a few black old cannon\r\nwere placed in formidable array, and in such a position as to be fully\r\nexposed to any destructive projectiles fired from the sea.\r\n\r\nOn went the down-at-heel wayfarer, his shifty eyes ever on the alert,\r\nviewing with suspicion the one or two persons he met. Apparently he was\r\nexpecting the arrival of some craft, for his gaze was constantly turned\r\ntowards the wide expanse of grey water, eager to detect the smallest\r\nspeck upon the horizon. Any one who regarded him critically might have\r\nnoticed something remarkable about his appearance, yet not even his most\r\nintimate friends would have recognised in this broken-down, half-starved\r\nclerk, who had arrived at Granton that morning, after tramping over from\r\nGlasgow, the popular man-about-town, the Count von Beilstein!\r\n\r\n\"Those fools will soon be swept away into eternity,\" he muttered to\r\nhimself, as he glanced back in the direction of the fort. \"They will\r\nhave an opportunity of tasting Russian lead, and of practising with\r\ntheir guns, which are only fit for a museum. They mount guard to defend\r\nan attack! Bah! They seek their own destruction, for no force can\r\nwithstand that which will presently appear to give them a sudden\r\nrousing. They will be elevated--blown into the air, together with their\r\nmiserable guns, their barracks, and the whole of their antiquated\r\nparaphernalia. And to me the world owes this national catastrophe! I am\r\nthe looker-on. These British have a proverb that the looker-on sees most\r\nof the game. _Bien! that is full of truth._\"\r\n\r\nAnd he chuckled to himself, pursuing his way at the same pace, now and\r\nthen glancing back as if to assure himself that no one dogged his\r\nfootsteps. Darkness had crept on quickly as he passed along through the\r\nopen country at Fillyside and entered Portobello, the little\r\nwatering-place so popular with holiday makers from Edinburgh during the\r\nsummer. Along the deserted promenade he strolled leisurely from end to\r\nend, and passing out of the town through Joppa, came at length to that\r\nrugged shore between the Salt Pans and Eastfield. The tide was out, so,\r\nleaving the road, he walked on in the darkness over the shingles until\r\nhe came to a small cove, and a moment later two men confronted him.\r\n\r\nA few sentences in Russian were rapidly exchanged between the spy and\r\nthe men, and then the latter at once guided him to where a boat lay in\r\nreadiness, but concealed. Five minutes later the Count was being rowed\r\nswiftly but silently away into the darkness by six stalwart men\r\nbelonging to one of the Tsar's battleships.\r\n\r\nThe oars dipped regularly as the boat glided onwards, but no word was\r\nexchanged, until about twenty minutes later the men suddenly stopped\r\npulling, a rope thrown by a mysterious but vigilant hand whistled over\r\ntheir heads and fell across them, and then they found themselves under\r\nthe dark side of a huge ironclad. It was the new battleship, _Admiral\r\nOrlovski_, which had only just left the Baltic for the first time.\r\nWithout delay the spy climbed on board, and was conducted at once by a\r\nyoung officer into the Admiral's private cabin.\r\n\r\nA bearded, middle-aged man, in handsome naval uniform, who was poring\r\nover a chart, rose as he entered. The spy, bowing, said briefly in\r\nRussian--\r\n\r\n\"I desire to see Prince Feodor Mazaroff, Admiral of the Fleet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am at your service, m'sieur,\" the other replied in French, motioning\r\nhim to a chair.\r\n\r\nThe Count, seating himself, tossed his hat carelessly upon the table,\r\nexplaining that he had been sent by the Russian Intelligence Department\r\nas bearer of certain important documents which would materially assist\r\nhim in his operations.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" observed the Prince, \"I received a telegram from the Ministry at\r\nPetersburg before I left Christiansand, telling me to await you here,\r\nand that you would furnish various information.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I am ready to do as far as lies in my power,\" replied the Count,\r\ntaking from his hip pocket a bulky packet, sealed with three great daubs\r\nof black wax. This he handed to the Prince, saying, \"It contains maps of\r\nthe country between Edinburgh and Glasgow, specially prepared by our\r\nSecret Service, together with a marked chart of the Firth of Forth, and\r\nfull detailed information regarding the troops remaining to defend this\r\ndistrict.\"\r\n\r\nThe Admiral broke the seals, and glanced eagerly through the contents,\r\nwith evident satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what is the general condition of the south of Scotland?\" the\r\nPrince asked, lounging back, twirling his moustache with a\r\nself-satisfied air.\r\n\r\n\"Totally unprepared. It is not believed that any attack will be made.\r\nThe military left north of the Cheviots after mobilisation were sent\r\nsouth to assist in the defence of Manchester.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us hope our expedition to-night will meet with success. We are now\r\none mile east of Craig Waugh, and in an hour our big guns will arouse\r\nLeith from its lethargy. You will be able to watch the fun from deck,\r\nand give us the benefit of your knowledge of the district. Is the fort\r\nat Leith likely to offer any formidable resistance?\" continued the\r\nAdmiral. \"I see the information here is somewhat vague upon that\r\npoint.\"\r\n\r\n\"The place is useless,\" replied the spy, as he stretched out his hand\r\nand took a pencil and paper from the Prince's writing-table. \"See! I\r\nwill sketch it for you. In the character of a starving workman who\r\ndesired to volunteer I called there, and succeeded in obtaining a good\r\nview of the interior. They have a few modern guns, but the remainder are\r\nold muzzleloaders, which against such guns as you have on board here\r\nwill be worse than useless.\" And as he spoke he rapidly sketched a plan\r\nof the defences in a neat and accurate manner, acquired by long\r\npractice. \"The most serious resistance will, however, be offered from\r\nInchkeith Island, four miles off Leith. There has lately been\r\nestablished there a new fort, containing guns of the latest type. A plan\r\nof the place, which I succeeded in obtaining a few days ago, is, you\r\nwill find, pinned to the chart of the Firth of Forth.\"\r\n\r\nThe Admiral opened out the document indicated, and closely examined the\r\nlittle sketch plan appended. On the chart were a number of small squares\r\nmarked in scarlet, surrounded by a blue circle to distinguish them more\r\nreadily from the dots of red which pointed out the position of the\r\nlights. These squares, prepared with the utmost care by von Beilstein,\r\nshowed the position of certain submarine mines, a plan of which he had\r\nsucceeded in obtaining by one of his marvellous master-strokes of\r\nfinesse.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to you, Count, our preparations are now complete,\" observed the\r\nPrince, offering the spy a cigarette from his silver case, and taking\r\none himself. \"Our transports, with three army corps, numbering nearly\r\n60,000 men and 200 guns, are at the present moment lying 12 miles north\r\nof the Bass Rock, awaiting orders to enter the Firth, therefore I think\r\nwhen we land we shall\"--\r\n\r\nA ray of brilliant white light streamed for a moment through the port of\r\nthe cabin, and then disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, jumping to his feet, looked out into the darkness, and saw\r\nthe long beam sweeping slowly round over the water, lighting up the\r\nships of his squadron in rapid succession.\r\n\r\n\"The search-lights of Inchkeith!\" he gasped, with an imprecation. \"I had\r\nno idea we were within their range, but now they have discovered us\r\nthere's no time to be lost. For the present I must leave you. You will,\r\nof course, remain on board, and land with us\"; and a moment later he\r\nrushed on deck, and shouted an order which was promptly obeyed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a low booming, and in another second a column of dark\r\nwater rose as the first shot ricochetted about five hundred yards from\r\ntheir bows. Orders shouted in Russian echoed through the ship, numbers\r\nof signals were exchanged rapidly with the other vessels, and the sea\r\nsuddenly became alive with torpedo boats.\r\n\r\nTime after time the British guns sounded like distant thunder, and shots\r\nfell in the vicinity of the Russian ships. Suddenly, as soon as the men\r\nwere at their quarters, electric signals rang from the conning-tower of\r\nthe _Admiral Orlovski_, and one of her 56-tonners crashed and roared\r\nfrom her turret, and a shot sped away towards where the light showed.\r\nThe noise immediately became deafening as the guns from nine other ships\r\nthundered almost simultaneously, sending a perfect hail of shell upon\r\nthe island fort. In the darkness the scene was one of most intense\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nFor the first time the spy found himself amidst the din of battle, and\r\nperhaps for the first time in his life his nerves were somewhat shaken\r\nas he stood in a convenient corner watching the working of one of the\r\ngreat guns in the turret, which regularly ran out and added its voice to\r\nthe incessant thunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nLANDING OF THE ENEMY AT LEITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the vessels were now under steam and approaching Inchkeith, when\r\nsuddenly two shells struck the _Admiral Orlovski_ amidships, carrying\r\naway a portion of her superstructure.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the other vessels were also hit almost at the same moment,\r\nand shortly afterwards a torpedo boat under the stern of the flagship\r\nwas struck by a shell, and sank with all hands. Time after time the\r\nRussian vessels poured out their storm of shell upon the fort, now only\r\nabout a mile and a half distant; but the British fire still continued as\r\nvigorous and more effective than at first.\r\n\r\nAgain the flagship was struck, this time on the port quarter, but the\r\nshot glanced off her armour into the sea; while a moment later another\r\nshell struck one of her fighting tops, and, bursting, wrecked two of the\r\nmachine guns, and killed half a dozen unfortunate fellows who had manned\r\nthem. The debris fell heavily upon the deck, and the disaster, being\r\nwitnessed by the spy, caused him considerable anxiety for his own\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nEven as he looked he suddenly noticed a brilliant flash from one of the\r\ncruisers lying a little distance away. There was a terrific report, and\r\namid flame and smoke wreckage shot high into the air. An explosion had\r\noccurred in the magazine, and it was apparent the ship was doomed! Other\r\ndisasters to the Russians followed in quick succession. A cruiser which\r\nwas lying near the Herwit light-buoy blazing away upon the fort,\r\nsuddenly rolled heavily and gradually heeled over, the water around her\r\nbeing thrown into the air by an explosion beneath the surface. A contact\r\nmine had been fired, and the bottom of the ship had been practically\r\nblown out, for a few minutes later she went down with nearly every soul\r\non board.\r\n\r\nAt the moment this disaster occurred, the _Admiral Orlovski_, still\r\ndischarging her heavy guns, was about half-way between the Briggs and\r\nthe Pallas Rock, when a search-light illuminated her from the land, and\r\na heavy fire was suddenly opened upon her from Leith Fort.\r\n\r\nThis was at once replied to, and while five of the vessels kept up their\r\nfire upon Inchkeith, the three others turned their attention towards\r\nLeith, and commenced to bombard it with common shell.\r\n\r\nHow effectual were their efforts the spy could at once see, for in the\r\ncourse of a quarter of an hour, notwithstanding the defence offered by\r\nLeith Fort and several batteries on Arthur's Seat, at Granton Point,\r\nWardie Bush, and at Seaside Meadows, near Portobello, fires were\r\nbreaking out in various quarters of the town, and factories and\r\nbuildings were now burning with increasing fury. The great paraffin\r\nrefinery had been set on fire, and the flames, leaping high into the\r\nair, shed a lurid glare far away over the sea.\r\n\r\nShells, striking the Corn Exchange, wrecked it, and one, flying away\r\nover the fort, burst in the Leith Distillery, with the result that the\r\nplace was set on fire, and soon burned with almost equal fierceness with\r\nthe paraffin works. The shipping in the Edinburgh, Albert, and Victoria\r\nDocks was ablaze, and the drill vessel H.M.S. _Durham_ had been\r\nshattered and was burning. A great row of houses in Lindsay Road had\r\nfallen prey to the flames, while among the other large buildings on fire\r\nwere the Baltic Hotel, the great goods station of the North British\r\nRailway, and the National Bank of Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being attacked from the forts on the island, and on land,\r\nthe Russians were now being vigorously fired upon by the British\r\nCoastguard ship _Imperieuse_, which, with the cruiser _Active_, and the\r\ngunboat cruisers _Cockchafer_, _Firm_, and _Watchful_, had now come\r\nwithin range. Soon, however, the enemy were reinforced by several\r\npowerful vessels, and in the fierce battle that ensued the British ships\r\nwere driven off. Then by reason of the reinforcements which the\r\nRussians brought up, and the great number of transports which were now\r\narriving, the defence, desperate though it had been, alas! broke down,\r\nand before midnight the invader set his foot upon Scottish soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POSITIONS FOR THE DEFENCE OF EDINBURGH.]\r\n\r\nEre the sun rose, a huge force of 60,000 men had commenced a march upon\r\nEdinburgh and Glasgow!\r\n\r\nEvents on shore during that never-to-be-forgotten night were well\r\ndescribed by Captain Tiller of the Royal Artillery, stationed at Leith\r\nFort, who, in a letter written to his young wife at Carlisle, on the\r\nfollowing day, gave the following narrative:--\r\n\r\n\"Disaster has fallen upon us. The Russians have landed in Scotland, and\r\nthe remnant of our force which was at Leith has fallen back inland. On\r\nFriday, just after nightfall, we were first apprised of our danger by\r\nhearing heavy firing from the sea in the direction of Inchkeith Fort,\r\nand all civilians were sent on inland, while we prepared for the fight.\r\n\r\n\"Very soon a number of ships were visible, some of them being evidently\r\ntransports, and as they were observed taking soundings, it was clear\r\nthat an immediate landing was intended. Fortunately it was a light\r\nnight, and while two Volunteer field batteries were sent out along the\r\ncoast west to Cramond and east to Fisherrow, we completed our\r\narrangements in the fort. With such antiquated weapons as were at our\r\ndisposal defeat was a foregone conclusion, and we knew that to annoy the\r\nenemy and delay their landing would be the extent of our resistance.\r\nSome of our guns were, of course, of comparatively recent date, and our\r\nsupply of ammunition was fair, but the Volunteer guns were antiquated\r\n40-pounder muzzleloaders, which ought to have been withdrawn years ago,\r\nand the gunners had had very little field training. The arrangements for\r\nhorsing the guns were also very inefficient, and they had no waggons or\r\ntransport. Most of our forces having been drawn south, the only infantry\r\navailable was a battalion and a half--really a provisional battalion,\r\nfor it was composed of portions of two Volunteer rifle regiments, with a\r\ndetachment of Regulars. Our Regular artillery detachment was,\r\nunfortunately, very inadequate, for although the armament of the fort\r\nhad been recently strengthened, the force had been weakened just before\r\nthe outbreak of war by the despatch of an Indian draft.\r\n\r\n\"It was apparent that the enemy would not attempt to destroy our\r\nposition, but land and carry it by assault; therefore, while the\r\nInchkeith guns kept them at bay, we undermined our fort, opened our\r\nmagazines, and got ready for a little target practice.\r\n\r\n\"The Volunteer batteries sent eastward had been ordered to do what\r\nexecution they could, and then, in the case of a reverse, to retire\r\nthrough Portobello and Duddingston to Edinburgh, and those on the west\r\nwere to go inland to Ratho; while we were resolved to hold the fort as\r\nlong as possible, and if at last we were compelled to retire we intended\r\nto blow up the place before leaving.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as we found the Russian flagship within range, we opened fire\r\nupon her, and this action caused a perfect storm of projectiles to be\r\ndirected upon us. The town was soon in flames, the shipping in the\r\nharbour sank, and the martello tower was blown to pieces. Our\r\nsearch-light was very soon brought into requisition, and by its aid some\r\nof the boats of the enemy's transports were sunk, while others came to\r\ngrief on the Black Rocks.\r\n\r\n\"By this time the enemy had turned their search-lights in every\r\ndirection where they could see firing, and very soon our Volunteer\r\nbatteries were silenced, and then Granton harbour fell into the hands of\r\nthe enemy's landing parties. Having first rendered their guns useless,\r\nthe survivors fell back to Corstorphine Hill, outside Edinburgh, and we\r\nsoon afterwards received intelligence that the Russians were landing at\r\nGranton in thousands. Meanwhile, although our garrison was so weak and\r\ninexperienced, we nevertheless kept up a vigorous fire.\r\n\r\n\"We saw how Inchkeith Fort had been silenced, and how our Volunteer\r\nbatteries had been destroyed, and knew that sooner or later we must\r\nshare the same fate, and abandon our position. As boatload after\r\nboatload of Russians attempted to land, we either sank them by shots\r\nfrom our guns or swept them with a salvo of bullets from our Maxims; yet\r\nas soon as we had hurled back one landing party others took its place.\r\n\r\n\"Many were the heroic deeds our gunners performed that night, as hand to\r\nhand they fought, and annihilated the Russians who succeeded in landing;\r\nbut in this frightful struggle we lost heavily, and at length, when all\r\nhope of an effective defence had been abandoned, we placed electric\r\nwires in the magazine, and the order was given to retire. This we did,\r\nleaving our search-light in position in order to deceive the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Half our number had been killed, and we sped across to Bonnington,\r\nrunning out a wire along the ground as we went. The Russians, now\r\nlanding rapidly in great force, swarmed into the fort and captured the\r\nguns and ammunition, while a party of infantry pursued us. But we kept\r\nthem back for fully a quarter of an hour, until we knew that the fort\r\nwould be well garrisoned by the invaders; then we sent a current through\r\nthe wire.\r\n\r\n\"The explosion that ensued was deafening, and its effect appalling.\r\nNever have I witnessed a more awful sight. Hundreds of tons of all sorts\r\nof explosives and ammunition were fired simultaneously by the electric\r\nspark, and the whole fort, with nearly six hundred of the enemy, who\r\nwere busy establishing their headquarters, were in an instant blown into\r\nthe air. For several moments the space around us where we stood seemed\r\nfilled with flying debris, and the mangled remains of those who a second\r\nbefore had been elated beyond measure by their success.\r\n\r\n\"Those were terribly exciting moments, and for a few seconds there was a\r\ncessation of the firing. Quickly, however, the bombardment was resumed,\r\nand although we totally annihilated the force pursuing us, we fell back\r\nto Restalrig, and at length gained the battery that had been established\r\non Arthur's Seat, and which was now keeping up a heavy fire upon the\r\nRussian transports lying out in the Narrow Deep. Subsequently we went on\r\nto Dalkeith. Our situation is most critical in every respect, but we are\r\nexpecting reinforcements, and a terrible battle is imminent.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus the Russians landed three corps of 20,000 each where they were\r\nleast expected, and at once prepared to invest Edinburgh and Glasgow.\r\nThree of the boats which came ashore at Leith that night, after the\r\nblowing up of the fort, brought several large mysterious-looking black\r\nboxes, which were handled with infinite care by the specially selected\r\ndetachment of men who had been told off to take charge of them. Upon the\r\nlocks were the official seals of the Russian War Office; and even the\r\nmen themselves, unaware of their contents, looked upon them with a\r\ncertain amount of suspicion, handling them very gingerly, and placing\r\nthem in waggons which they seized from a builder's yard on the outskirts\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\nThe officers alone knew the character of these mysterious consignments,\r\nand as they superintended the landing, whispered together excitedly. The\r\nnews of the invasion, already telegraphed throughout Scotland from end\r\nto end, caused the utmost alarm; but had the people known what those\r\nblack boxes, the secret of which was so carefully guarded, contained,\r\nthey would have been dismayed and appalled.\r\n\r\nTruth to tell, the Russians were about to try a method of wholesale and\r\nawful destruction, which, although vaguely suggested in time of peace,\r\nhad never yet been tested in the field.\r\n\r\nIf successful, they knew it would cause death and desolation over an\r\ninconceivably wide area, and prove at once a most extraordinary and\r\nstartling development of modern warfare. The faces of a whole army,\r\nhowever brave, would blanch before its terrific power, and war in every\r\nbranch, on land and on sea, would become revolutionised.\r\n\r\nBut the boxes remained locked and guarded. The secret was to be kept\r\nuntil the morrow, when the first trial was ordered to be made, and the\r\nofficers in charge expressed an opinion between themselves that a blow\r\nwould then be struck that would at once startle and terrify the whole\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nATTACK ON EDINBURGH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn attacking Edinburgh the besiegers at once discovered they had a much\r\nmore difficult task than they had anticipated. The Russian onslaught had\r\nbeen carefully planned. Landing just before dawn, the 1st Corps,\r\nconsisting of about twenty thousand men, marched direct to Glasgow by\r\nway of South Queensferry and Kirkliston, and through Linlithgow, sacking\r\nand burning all three towns in the advance.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd Army Corps succeeded, after some very sharp skirmishing, in\r\noccupying the Pentland Hills, in order to protect the flanks of the\r\nfirst force, while a strong detachment was left behind to guard the base\r\nat Leith. The 2nd Corps meanwhile marched direct upon Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe defenders, consisting of Militia, Infantry, Artillery, the local\r\nVolunteers left behind during the mobilisation, and a large number of\r\ncivilians from the neighbouring towns, who had hastily armed on hearing\r\nthe alarming news, were quickly massed in three divisions on the\r\nLammermuir Hills, along the hills near Peebles, and on Tinto Hill, near\r\nLanark.\r\n\r\nThe Russian army corps which marched from Leith upon Edinburgh about\r\nseven o'clock on the following morning met with a most desperate\r\nresistance. On Arthur's Seat a strong battery had been established by\r\nthe City of Edinburgh Artillery, under Col. J. F. Mackay, and the 1st\r\nBerwickshire, under Col. A. Johnston; and on the higher parts of the\r\nQueen's Drive, overlooking the crooked little village of Duddingston,\r\nguns of the 1st Forfarshire, under Col. Stewart-Sandeman, V.D., flashed\r\nand shed forth torrents of bullets and shell, which played havoc with\r\nthe enemy's infantry coming up the Portobello and Musselburgh roads.\r\nBatteries on the Braid and Blackford Hills commanded the southern\r\nportion of the city; while to the west, the battery on Corstorphine Hill\r\nprevented the enemy from pushing along up the high road from Granton.\r\n\r\nBetween Jock's Lodge and Duddingston Mills the Russians, finding cover,\r\ncommenced a sharp attack about nine o'clock; but discovering, after an\r\nhour's hard fighting, that to attempt to carry the defenders' position\r\nwas futile, they made a sudden retreat towards Niddry House.\r\n\r\nThe British commander, observing this, and suspecting their intention to\r\nmake a circuit and enter the city by way of Newington, immediately set\r\nhis field telegraph to work, and sent news on to the infantry brigade at\r\nBlackford.\r\n\r\nThis consisted mainly of the Queen's Volunteer Rifle Brigade (Royal\r\nScots), under Col. T. W. Jones, V.D.; the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th\r\nVolunteer Battalions of the Royal Scots, under Col. W. U. Martin, V.D.,\r\nCol. W. I. Macadam, Col. Sir G. D. Clerk, Col. P. Dods, and Col. G. F.\r\nMelville respectively, with a company of engineers. The intelligence\r\nthey received placed them on the alert, and ere long the enemy extended\r\nhis flank in an endeavour to enter Newington. The bridges already\r\nprepared for demolition by the defenders were now promptly blown up, and\r\nin the sharp fight that ensued the enemy were repulsed with heavy loss.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the formidable division of the 3rd Russian Army Corps guarding\r\nthe base at Leith had attacked the Corstorphine position, finding their\r\nheadquarters untenable under its fire, and although losing several guns\r\nand a large number of men, they succeeded, after about an hour's hard\r\nfighting, in storming the hill and sweeping away the small but gallant\r\nband of defenders.\r\n\r\nThe fight was long. It was a struggle to the death. Over the whole\r\nhistoric battle-ground from the Tweed to the Forth, fighting spread, and\r\neverywhere the loss of life was terrible.\r\n\r\nThe long autumn day passed slowly, yet hostilities continued as vigorous\r\nand sanguinary as they had begun. Before the sun sank many a brave\r\nBriton lay dead or dying, but many more Muscovites had been sent to that\r\nbourne whence none return.\r\n\r\nAs it was, the British line of communications was broken between Temple\r\nand Eddleston, the outposts at the latter place having been surprised\r\nand slaughtered. But although the enemy strove hard to break down the\r\nlines of defence and invest Edinburgh, yet time after time they were\r\nhurled back with fearful loss. Colinton and Liberton were sacked and\r\nburned by the Tsar's forces. On every hand the Russians spread death and\r\ndestruction; still the defenders held their own, and when the fighting\r\nceased after nightfall Edinburgh was still safe. Strong barricades\r\nmanned by civilians had been hastily thrown up near the station in Leith\r\nWalk, in London Road opposite the Abbey Church, in Inverleith Row, in\r\nClerk Street and Montague Street, while all the bridges over the Water\r\nof Leith had been blown up with gun-cotton; quick-firing guns had been\r\nposted on Calton Hill and at the Castle, while in St. Andrew's Square a\r\nbattery had been established by the 1st Haddington Volunteer Artillery,\r\nunder Major J. J. Kelly, who had arrived in haste from Dunbar, and this\r\nexcellent position commanded a wide stretch of country away towards\r\nGranton.\r\n\r\nAt dead of night, under the calm, bright stars, a strange scene might\r\nhave been witnessed. In the deep shadow cast by the wall of an old and\r\ntumble-down barn near the cross-roads at Niddry, about three miles from\r\nEdinburgh, two Russian infantry officers were in earnest conversation.\r\nThey stood leaning upon a broken fence, talking in a half-whisper in\r\nFrench, so that the half-dozen privates might not understand what they\r\nsaid. The six men were busy unpacking several strange black cases,\r\nhandling the contents with infinite care. Apparently three of the boxes\r\ncontained a quantity of fine silk, carefully folded, while another\r\ncontained a number of square, dark-looking packages, which, when taken\r\nout, were packed in order upon a strong net which was first spread upon\r\nthe grass. Ropes were strewn over the ground in various directions, the\r\nsilk was unfolded, and presently, when all the contents had been\r\nminutely inspected by the two officers with lanterns, a small tube was\r\ntaken from a box that had remained undisturbed, and fastened into an\r\nobject shaped like a bellows.\r\n\r\nThen, when all preparations were satisfactorily completed, the six men\r\nthrew themselves upon the grass to snatch an hour's repose, while the\r\nofficers returned to their previous positions, leaning against the\r\nbroken fence, and gravely discussing their proposals for the morrow's\r\ngigantic sensation. The elder of the two was explaining to his companion\r\nthe nature of the _coup_ which they intended to deliver, and the mode in\r\nwhich it would be made. So engrossed were they in the contemplation of\r\nthe appalling results that would accrue, they did not observe that they\r\nwere standing beneath a small square hole in the wall of the barn;\r\nneither did they notice that from this aperture a dark head protruded\r\nfor a second and then quick as lightning withdrew. It was only like a\r\nshadow, and disappeared instantly!\r\n\r\nTen minutes later a mysterious figure was creeping cautiously along\r\nunder the hedge of the high road to Newington in the direction of the\r\nBritish lines. Crawling along the grass, and pausing now and then with\r\nhis ear to the ground, listening, he advanced by short, silent stages,\r\nexercising the greatest caution, well aware that death would be his fate\r\nshould he be discovered. In wading the Braid Burn he almost betrayed\r\nhimself to a Russian sentry; but at last, after travelling for over an\r\nhour, risking discovery at any moment, he at length passed the British\r\noutposts beyond Liberton, and ascended the Braid Hills to the\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nThe story he told the General commanding was at first looked upon as\r\nludicrous. In the dim candlelight in the General's tent he certainly\r\nlooked a disreputable derelict, his old and tattered clothes wet\r\nthrough, his hands cut by stones and bleeding, and his face half covered\r\nwith mud. The three officers who were with the General laughed when he\r\ndashed in excitedly, and related the conversation he had overheard; yet\r\nwhen he subsequently went on to describe in detail what he had\r\nwitnessed, and when they remembered that this tramp was an artilleryman\r\nwho had long ago been conspicuous by his bravery at El Teb, and an\r\ningenious inventor, their expression of amusement gave way to one of\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nThe General, who had been writing, thoughtfully tapped the little camp\r\ntable before him with his pen. \"So they intend to destroy us and wreck\r\nthe city by that means, now that their legitimate tactics have failed! I\r\ncan scarcely credit that such is their intention; yet if they should be\r\nsuccessful--if\"--\r\n\r\n\"But they will not be successful, sir. If you will send some one to\r\nassist me, and allow me to act as I think fit, I will frustrate their\r\ndastardly design, and the city shall be saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are at liberty to act as you please. You know their plans, and I\r\nhave perfect confidence in you, Mackenzie,\" replied the officer. \"Do\r\nnot, however, mention a word of the enemy's intention to any one. It\r\nwould terrify the men; and although I do not doubt their bravery, yet\r\nthe knowledge of such a horrible fate hanging over them must necessarily\r\nincrease their anxiety, and thus prevent them from doing their best. We\r\nare weak, but remember we are all Britons. Now come,\" he added, \"sit\r\nthere, upon that box, and explain at once what is your scheme of defence\r\nagainst this extraordinary attack.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the fearless man to whom the General had entrusted the defence of\r\nEdinburgh obeyed, and commenced to explain what means he intended to\r\ntake--a desperate but well-devised plan, which drew forth words of the\r\nhighest commendation from the commanding officer and those with him.\r\nThey knew that the fate of Edinburgh hung in the balance, and that if\r\nthe city were taken it would be the first step towards their downfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\"THE DEMON OF WAR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, just before the break of day, British bugles sounded,\r\nand the camp on the Braid Hills was immediately astir. That the enemy\r\nwere about to test the efficiency of a new gigantic engine of war was\r\nunknown except to the officers and the brave man who had risked his life\r\nin order to obtain the secret of the foeman's plans.\r\n\r\nTo him the British General was trusting, and as with knit brows and\r\nanxious face the grey-haired officer stood at the door of his tent\r\ngazing across the burn to Blackford Hill, he was wondering whether he\r\nhad yet obtained his coign of vantage. From the case slung round his\r\nshoulder he drew his field glasses and turned them upon a clump of trees\r\nnear the top of the hill, straining his eyes to discover any movement.\r\n\r\nOn the crest of the hill two Volunteer artillery batteries were actively\r\npreparing for the coming fray, but as yet it was too dark to discern\r\nanything among the distant clump of trees; so, replacing his glasses,\r\nthe commanding officer re-entered his tent and bent for a long time over\r\nthe Ordnance Map under the glimmering, uncertain light of a guttering\r\ncandle.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Russians were busily completing their arrangements for\r\nstriking an appalling blow.\r\n\r\nConcealed by a line of trees and a number of farm buildings, the little\r\nsection of the enemy had worked indefatigably for the past two hours,\r\nand now in the grey dawn the contents of the mysterious boxes, a long\r\ndark monster, lay upon the grass, moving restlessly, trying to free\r\nitself from its trammels.\r\n\r\nIt was a huge and curiously-shaped air-ship, and was to be used for\r\ndropping great charges of melinite and steel bombs filled with picric\r\nacid into the handsome historic city of Edinburgh! Some of the shells\r\nwere filled with sulphurous acid, carbon dioxide, and other deadly\r\ncompounds, the intent being to cause suffocation over wide areas by the\r\nvolatilisation of liquid gases!\r\n\r\nThis controllable electric balloon, a perfection of M. Gaston\r\nTissandier's invention a few years before, was, as it lay upon the\r\ngrass, nearly inflated and ready to ascend, elongated in form, and\r\nfilled with hydrogen.\r\n\r\nIt was about 140 feet long, 63 feet in diameter through the middle, and\r\nthe envelope was of fine cloth coated with an impermeable varnish. On\r\neither side were horizontal shafts of flexible walnut laths, fastened\r\nwith silk belts along the centre, and over the balloon a netting of\r\nribbons was placed, and to this the car was connected. On each of the\r\nfour sides was a screw propeller 12 feet in diameter, driven by\r\nbichromate of potassium batteries and a dynamo-electric motor. The\r\npropellers were so arranged that the balloon could keep head to a\r\nhurricane, and when proceeding with the wind would deviate immediately\r\nfrom its course by the mere pulling of a lever by the aeronaut.\r\n\r\nCarefully packed in the car were large numbers of the most powerful\r\ninfernal machines, ingeniously designed to effect the most awful\r\ndestruction if hurled into a thickly-populated centre. Piled in the\r\nsmallest possible compass were square steel boxes, some filled with\r\nmelinite, dynamite, and an explosive strongly resembling cordite, only\r\npossessing twice its strength, each with fulminating compounds, while\r\nothers contained picric acid fitted with glass detonating tubes. Indeed,\r\nthis gigantic engine, which might totally wreck a city and kill every\r\ninhabitant in half an hour while at an altitude of 61/2 miles, had rightly\r\nbeen named by the Pole who had perfected Tissandier's invention--\"The\r\nDemon of War.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the two officers of the Russian balloon section, both experienced\r\naeronauts, were finally examining minutely every rope, ascertaining that\r\nall was ready for the ascent, away on Blackford Hill one man, pale and\r\ndetermined, with coat and vest thrown aside, was preparing a\r\ncounterblast to the forthcoming attack. Under cover of the clump of\r\ntrees, but with its muzzle pointing towards Bridgend, a long, thin gun\r\nof an altogether strange type had been brought into position. It was\r\nabout four times the size of a Maxim, which it resembled somewhat in\r\nshape, only the barrel was much longer, the store of ammunition being\r\ncontained in a large steel receptacle at the side, wherein also was some\r\nmarvellously-contrived mechanism. The six gunners who were assisting\r\nMackenzie at length completed their work, and the gun having been\r\ncarefully examined by the gallant man in charge and two of the officers\r\nwho had been in the tent with the General during the midnight\r\nconsultation, Mackenzie, with a glance in the yet hazy distance where\r\nthe enemy had bivouaced, pulled over a small lever, which immediately\r\nstarted a dynamo.\r\n\r\n\"In three minutes we shall be ready for action,\" he said, glancing at\r\nhis watch; and then, turning a small wheel which raised the muzzle of\r\nthe gun so as to point it at a higher angle in the direction of the sky,\r\nhe waited until the space of time he had mentioned had elapsed.\r\n\r\nThe officers stood aside conversing in an undertone. This man Mackenzie\r\nhad invented this strange-looking weapon, and only one had been made. It\r\nhad some months before been submitted to the War Office, but they had\r\ndeclined to take it up, believing that a patent they already possessed\r\nwas superior to it; yet Mackenzie had nevertheless thrown his whole soul\r\ninto his work, and meant now to show his superiors its penetrative\r\npowers, and put its capabilities to practical test. Again he glanced at\r\nhis watch, and quickly pulled back another lever, which caused the motor\r\nto revolve at twice the speed, and the gun to emit a low hissing sound,\r\nlike escaping steam. Then he stepped back to the officers, saying--\r\n\r\n\"I am now prepared. It will go up as straight and quickly as a rocket,\r\nbut we must catch it before it ascends two miles, for the clouds hang\r\nlow, and we may lose it more quickly than we imagine.\"\r\n\r\nThe gunners stood in readiness, and the two officers looked away over\r\nCraigmillar towards the grey distant sea. Dawn was spreading now, and\r\nthe haze was gradually clearing. They all knew the attempt would be made\r\nere long, before it grew much lighter, so they stood at their posts in\r\nreadiness, Mackenzie with his hand upon the lever which would regulate\r\nthe discharge.\r\n\r\nThey were moments of breathless expectancy. Minute after minute went by,\r\nbut not a word was spoken, for every eye was turned upon the crest of a\r\ncertain ridge nearly three miles away, at a point where the country was\r\nwell wooded.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour had thus elapsed, when Mackenzie suddenly shouted,\r\n\"Look, lads! _There she goes!_ Now, let's teach 'em what Scots can do.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there rose from behind the ridge a great dark mass, looking\r\nalmost spectral in the thin morning mist. For a moment it seemed to\r\npoise and swing as if uncertain in its flight, then quickly it shot\r\nstraight up towards the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Ready?\" shouted Mackenzie, his momentary excitement having given place\r\nto great coolness. The men at their posts all answered in the\r\naffirmative. Mackenzie bent and waited for a few seconds sighting the\r\ngun, while the motor hummed with terrific speed. Then shouting \"Fire!\"\r\nhe drew back the lever.\r\n\r\nThe gun discharged, but there was no report, only a sharp hiss as the\r\ncompressed air released commenced to send charge after charge of\r\ndynamite automatically away into space in rapid succession!\r\n\r\nNone dared to breathe. The excitement was intense. They watched the\r\neffect upon the Russian balloon, but to their dismay saw it still\r\nrapidly ascending and unharmed!\r\n\r\nIt had altered its course, and instead of drifting away seaward was now\r\ntravelling towards Duddingston, and making straight for Edinburgh,\r\npassing above the Russian camp.\r\n\r\n\"Missed! _missed!_\" Mackenzie shrieked, turning back the lever and\r\narresting the discharge. \"It's four miles off now, and we can carry\r\nseven and three-quarters to hit a fixed object. Remember, lads, the fate\r\nof Auld Reekie is now in your hands! Ready?\"\r\n\r\nAgain he bent and sighted the gun, raising the muzzle higher than the\r\nballoon so as to catch it on the ascent. The motor hummed louder and\r\nlouder, the escaping air hissed and turned into liquid by the enormous\r\npressure, then with a glance at the gauge he yelled \"Fire!\" and pulled\r\nback the lever.\r\n\r\nDynamite shells, ejected at the rate of 50 a minute, rushed from the\r\nmuzzle, and sped away.\r\n\r\nBut the Demon of War, with its whirling propellers, continued on its\r\nswift, silent mission of destruction.\r\n\r\n\"Missed again!\" cried one of the men, in despair. \"See! it's gone!\r\nWe've--good heavens!--_why, we've lost it--lost it!_\"\r\n\r\nMackenzie, who had been glancing that moment at the gauges, gazed\r\neagerly up, and staggered back as if he had received a blow. \"It's\r\ndisappeared!\" he gasped. \"_They've outwitted us, the brutes, and nothing\r\nnow can save Edinburgh from destruction!_\"\r\n\r\nOfficers and men stood aghast, with blanched faces, scarce knowing how\r\nto act. The destructive forces in that controllable balloon were more\r\nthan sufficient to lay the whole of Edinburgh in ruins; and then, no\r\ndoubt, the enemy would attempt by the same means to destroy the British\r\nbatteries on the neighbouring hills. Already, along the valleys fighting\r\nhad begun, for rapid firing could be heard in the direction of\r\nGilmerton, and now and then the British guns on the Braid Hills behind\r\nspoke out sharply to the Russians who had occupied Loanhead, and the\r\ndistant booming of cannon could be heard incessantly from Corstorphine.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a loud, exultant cry from Mackenzie caused his companions to\r\nstrain their eyes away to Duddingston, and there they saw high in the\r\nair the monster aerial machine gradually looming through the mist, a\r\nvague and shadowy outline. It had passed through a bank of cloud, and\r\nwas gradually reappearing.\r\n\r\n\"Quick! There's not a moment to lose!\" shrieked Mackenzie, springing to\r\nthe lever with redoubled enthusiasm, an example followed by the others.\r\n\r\nThe motor revolved so rapidly that it roared, the gauges ran high, the\r\nescaping air hissed so loudly that Mackenzie was compelled to shout at\r\nthe top of his voice \"Ready?\" as for a third time he took careful aim at\r\nthe misty object now six miles distant.\r\n\r\nThe War Demon was still over the Russian camp, and in a few moments,\r\ntravelling at that high rate of speed, it would pass over Arthur's Seat,\r\nand be enabled to drop its deadly compounds in Princes Street. But\r\nMackenzie set his teeth, and muttered something under his breath.\r\n\r\n\"_Now!_\" he ejaculated, as he suddenly pulled the lever, and for the\r\nlast time sent forth the automatic shower of destructive shells.\r\n\r\nA second later there was a bright flash from above as if the sun itself\r\nhad burst, and then came a most terrific explosion, which caused the\r\nearth to tremble where they stood. The clouds were rent asunder by the\r\nfrightful detonation, and down upon the Russian camp the debris of their\r\ningenious invention fell in a terrible death-dealing shower. The\r\nannihilation of the dastardly plot to wreck the city was complete. Small\r\ndynamite shells from Mackenzie's pneumatic gun had struck the car of the\r\nballoon, and by the firing of half a ton of explosives the enemy was in\r\nan instant hoist with his own petard.\r\n\r\nAs the debris fell within the Russian lines, some fifty or sixty\r\npicric-acid bombs--awful engines of destruction--which had not been\r\nexploded in mid-air, crashed into the Muscovite ranks, and, bursting,\r\nkilled and wounded hundreds of infantrymen and half a regiment of\r\nCossacks. One, bursting in the enemy's headquarters, seriously injured\r\nseveral members of the staff; while another, falling among the\r\nEngineers' transport, exploded a great quantity of gun-cotton, which in\r\nits turn killed a number of men and horses.\r\n\r\nThe disaster was awful in its suddenness, appalling in its completeness.\r\nThe aeronauts, totally unprepared for such an attack, had been blown to\r\natoms just when within an ace of success.\r\n\r\nFortune had favoured Britain, and, thanks to Mackenzie's vigilance and\r\nhis pneumatic dynamite gun, which the Government had rejected as a\r\nworthless weapon, the grey old city of Edinburgh was still safe.\r\n\r\nBut both Russians and Britons had now mustered their forces, and this,\r\nthe first note sounded of a second terrific and desperately-fought\r\nbattle, portended success for Britain's gallant army.\r\n\r\nYet notwithstanding the disaster the enemy sustained by the blowing up\r\nof their balloon, their 2nd Army Corps, together with the portion of the\r\n3rd Army Corps operating from their base at Leith, succeeded, after\r\nterribly hard fighting and heavy losses, in at length forcing back the\r\ndefenders from the Braid and Blackford Hills, and the Corstorphine\r\nposition having already been occupied, they were then enabled to invest\r\nEdinburgh. That evening fierce sanguinary fights took place in the\r\nstreets, for the people held the barricades until the last moment, and\r\nthe batteries on Calton Hill, in St. Andrew's Square, and at the Castle\r\neffected terrible execution in conjunction with those on Arthur's Seat.\r\nStill the enemy by their overwhelming numbers gradually broke down these\r\ndefences, and, after appalling slaughter on both sides, occupied the\r\ncity. The fighting was fiercest along Princes Street, Lothian Road, and\r\nin the neighbourhood of Scotland Street Station, while along Cumberland\r\nand Great King Streets the enemy were swept away in hundreds by British\r\nMaxims brought to bear from Drummond Place. Along Canongate from\r\nHolyrood to Moray House, and in Lauriston Place and the Grassmarket,\r\nhand-to-hand struggles took place between the patriotic civilians and\r\nthe foe. From behind their barricades men of Edinburgh fought valiantly,\r\nand everywhere inflicted heavy loss; still the enemy, pressing onward,\r\nset fire to a number of public buildings, including the Register Office,\r\nthe Royal Exchange, the University, the Liberal and New Clubs, and\r\nPalace Hotel, with many other buildings in Princes Street. The fires,\r\nwhich broke out rapidly in succession, were caused for the purpose of\r\nproducing a panic, and in this the enemy were successful, for the city\r\nwas quickly looted, and the scenes of ruin, death, and desolation that\r\noccurred in its streets that night were awful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"IN EDINBURGH THE FIGHTING WAS FIERCEST ALONG PRINCES\r\nSTREET.\"]\r\n\r\nIn every quarter the homes of loyal Scotsmen were entered by the\r\nruthless invader, who wrecked the cherished household gods, and carried\r\naway all the valuables that were portable. Outrage and murder were rife\r\neverywhere, and no quarter was shown the weak or unprotected. Through\r\nthe streets the invader rushed with sword and firebrand, causing\r\ndestruction, suffering, and death.\r\n\r\nThe defenders, though straining every nerve to stem the advancing tide,\r\nhad, alas! been unsuccessful, and ere midnight Edinburgh, one of the\r\nproudest and most historic cities in the world, had fallen, and the\r\nBritish standard floating over the Castle was, alas! replaced by the\r\nEagle of the Russian Autocrat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nFRIGHTFUL SLAUGHTER OUTSIDE GLASGOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a sad misfortune, a national calamity; yet our troops did not\r\nlose heart. Commanded as they were by Britons, astute, loyal, and\r\nfearless, they, after fighting hard, fell back from Edinburgh in order,\r\nand husbanded their force for the morrow.\r\n\r\nIndeed, soon after dawn the Russians found themselves severely attacked.\r\nExultant over their success, they had, while sacking Edinburgh, left\r\ntheir base at Leith very inadequately protected, with the result that\r\nthe defenders, swooping suddenly down upon the town, succeeded, with the\r\nassistance of four coast-defence ships and a number of torpedo boats, in\r\nblowing up most of the Russian transports, and seizing their ammunition\r\nand provisions.\r\n\r\nSuch an attack was, of course, very vigorously defended, but it was a\r\nsmart manoeuvre on the part of the British General, and enabled him,\r\nafter cutting off the enemy's line of retreat, to turn suddenly and\r\nattack the Russians who were continuing their destructive campaign\r\nthrough the streets of Edinburgh. This bold move on the part of the\r\ndefenders was totally unexpected by the foe, which accounted for the\r\nfrightful loss of life that was sustained on the Russian side, and the\r\nsubsequent clever tactics which resulted in the driving out of the\r\ninvaders from Edinburgh, and British troops reoccupying that city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE BATTLEFIELD OUTSIDE GLASGOW.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the 1st Russian Army Corps, which on landing had at once set\r\nout towards Glasgow, had marched on in a great extended line, sacking\r\nthe various towns through which they passed. As they advanced from\r\nLinlithgow, Airdrie, and Coatbridge were looted and burned, while\r\nfurther south, Motherwell, Hamilton, and Bothwell shared the same fate.\r\nAbout 20,000 men, together with 11,000 who had been forced to evacuate\r\nEdinburgh, had at length advanced a little beyond Coatbridge, and, in\r\npreparation for a vigorous siege of Glasgow, halted within seven miles\r\nof the city, with flanks extended away south to Motherwell and on to\r\nWishaw, and north as far as Chryston and Kirkintilloch.\r\n\r\nIn Glasgow the excitement was intense, and surging crowds filled the\r\nstreets night and day. The fall of Edinburgh had produced the greatest\r\nsensation, and the meagre news of the disaster telegraphed had scarcely\r\nbeen supplemented when the report of the retaking of \"Auld Reekie\" came\r\nto hand, causing great rejoicing. Nevertheless, it was known that over\r\nthirty thousand trained soldiers were on their way to the banks of the\r\nClyde, and Glasgow was fevered and turbulent. The scanty business that\r\nhad lately been done was now at a standstill, and the meagre supplies\r\nthat reached there from America not being half sufficient for the\r\nenormous population, the city was already starving. But, as in other\r\ntowns, great barricades had been thrown up, and those in Gallowgate and\r\nDuke Street, thoroughfares by which Glasgow might be entered by way of\r\nParkhead and Dennistoun, were soon manned by loyal and patriotic bands\r\nof civilians. Other barriers were constructed at St. Rollox Station, in\r\nCanning Street, in Monteith Row, and in Great Western, Dumbarton, and\r\nGovan Roads.\r\n\r\nSouth of the river, Eglinton Street and the roads at Crosshill were\r\nbarricaded, and in New City and Garscube Roads in the north there were\r\nalso strong defences. All were held by enthusiastic bodies of men who\r\nhad hastily armed themselves, confident in the belief that our\r\nVolunteers and the small body of Regulars would not allow the invader to\r\nmarch in force upon their city without a most determined resistance.\r\n\r\nNow, however, the alarming news reached Glasgow that the enemy had\r\nactually sacked and burned Coatbridge. In an hour they could commence\r\nlooting the shops in Gallowgate, and their heavy tramp would be heard on\r\nthe granite of Trongate and Argyle Street! Throughout the city the\r\nfeeling of insecurity increased, and hourly the panic assumed greater\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThe sun that day was obscured by dark thunder-clouds, the swirling\r\nClyde flowed on black beneath its many bridges, and the outlook was\r\neverywhere gloomy and ominous.\r\n\r\nStill, away on the hills to southward, our small force of soldiers and\r\nVolunteers had narrowly watched the onward tide of destroyers, and\r\ncarefully laid their plans. The manner in which the defensive operations\r\nwere conducted is perhaps best related in a letter written by Captain\r\nBoyd Drummond of the 1st Battalion Princess Louise's (Argyll and\r\nSutherland) Highlanders, to a friend in London, and which was published\r\nwith the accompanying sketch in the _Daily Graphic_.\r\n\r\nHe wrote as follows:--\"On the second day after the Russians had landed,\r\nColonel Cumberland of 'Ours' received orders to move us from Lanark, and\r\nreconnoitre as far as possible along the Carluke road, with a view to\r\ntaking up a position to cover the advance of the division, which had\r\nduring the morning been considerably reinforced by nearly half the\r\ncentre division from Peebles. In addition to our battalion with two\r\nmachine guns, Colonel Cumberland was in command of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd,\r\nand 4th Volunteer Battalions from Greenock, Paisley, Pollokshaws, and\r\nStirling respectively, the 1st Dumbarton from Helensburgh, the Highland\r\nBorderers, and the Renfrew Militia, together with a section of field\r\nartillery, a field company of Royal Engineers, and about forty cavalry\r\nand cyclists. Arriving at Carluke early in the afternoon, we awaited the\r\nreturn of scouts, who had been pushed on in advance to beyond Wishaw, in\r\nthe direction of the enemy. They having reported that the Russians had\r\nwithdrawn from Wishaw, we at once moved on to Law Junction, about a mile\r\nfrom that town, and finally took up a position for the night near\r\nWaterloo, commanding Wishaw and Overtown.\r\n\r\n\"Beyond the junction, towards Glasgow, the railway, which the enemy\r\nevidently did not intend to use, had been destroyed, but scouts from\r\nMorningside reported that the line to Edinburgh had not been cut, and\r\nthat the permanent way remained uninjured. Colonel Cumberland therefore\r\ntold off the right half battalion, with a machine gun, a section of\r\nEngineers, and six cyclists, to take up a position near the road between\r\nNewmains and Morningside, with instructions to form piquets and patrol\r\nthe roads north and east. I was with No. 1 Company, but, being senior\r\ncaptain present, the chief gave me command of this detachment. It was\r\nthe first time such a responsibility had been conferred upon me;\r\ntherefore I was determined not to be caught napping.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as we arrived at our ground, I sent two cyclists out to\r\nNewmains and two to Morningside, with orders to glean what information\r\nthey could, and to wait in the villages until further orders, unless\r\nthey sighted the enemy's outposts, or discovered anything important. As\r\nsoon as I had sent out my piquets, I took my own company and six of the\r\nEngineers down to Morningside. Some of the villagers, who had escaped\r\nwhen a portion of the invaders passed through on the previous night, had\r\nreturned, and the cyclists gathered from them that we were close upon\r\nthe heels of the Russian rearguard.\r\n\r\n\"As the railway had not been destroyed, I thought that possibly the\r\ninvaders intended to use the line _via_ Mid-Calder, and therefore\r\nexamined the station closely. While engaged in this, one of the\r\nEngineers suddenly discovered a wire very carefully concealed along the\r\nline, and as we followed it up 500 yards each way, and could find no\r\nconnection with the instrument at the station office, I at once\r\nconcluded that it was the enemy's field telegraph, forming means of\r\ncommunication between their headquarters at Airdrie and the division\r\nthat still remained in the Pentlands.\r\n\r\n\"Cutting the wire, and attaching the ends to the instrument in the\r\nstation, I left three Engineers, all expert telegraphists, to tap the\r\nwire, and they, with the right half company, under Lieutenant Compton,\r\nformed a detached post at this point. I also left the cyclists to convey\r\nto me any messages which might be received on the instrument, and then\r\nproceeded to Newmains. The place was now a mere heap of smouldering\r\nruins; but, as at Morningside, some of the terrified villagers had\r\nreturned, and they stated that early in the morning they had seen small\r\ndetachments of Russian cavalry pass through from Bankle, and proceed\r\nnorth along the Cleland road.\r\n\r\n\"Leaving the left half company here with the other Engineers and the two\r\ncyclists, under Lieutenant Planck, with orders to block the road and\r\nrailway bridge, I returned to my piquet line. A few minutes later,\r\nhowever, a cyclist rode up with a copy of a message which had been sent\r\nfrom the Russian headquarters on the Pentlands to the Glasgow investing\r\nforce. The message was in cipher, but, thanks to the information\r\nfurnished by the spy who was captured near Manchester, we were now aware\r\nof some of the codes used by the invaders, and I sent the messenger on\r\nto the Colonel at once. One of his staff was able to transcribe it\r\nsufficiently to show that some disaster had occurred to the enemy on the\r\nPentlands, for it concluded with an order withdrawing the troops from\r\nGlasgow, in order to reinforce the 3rd Army Corps in the fierce battle\r\nthat was now proceeding. It was also stated in the message that\r\ndespatches followed, so at once we were all on the alert.\r\n\r\n\"Almost immediately afterwards news was received over our own telegraph\r\nfrom Carstairs, stating that a terrific battle had been fought along the\r\nvalleys between Leadburn, Linton, and Dolphinton, in which we had\r\nsuffered very severely, but we had nevertheless gained a decisive\r\nvictory, for from dawn until the time of telegraphing it was estimated\r\nthat no fewer than 12,000 Russians had been killed or wounded.\r\n\r\n\"It appeared that our forces on the Lammermuirs had moved quickly, and,\r\nextending along the ridges, through Tynehead, and thence to Heriot, and\r\non to Peebles, joined hands with the division at that place before dawn,\r\nand, when it grew light, had made a sudden and desperate attack. The\r\nenemy, who had imagined himself in a safe position, was unprepared, and\r\nfrom the first moment of the attack the slaughter was awful. As noon\r\nwore on the battle had increased, until now the invaders had been\r\noutflanked, and mowed down in such a frightful manner, that the\r\nsurvivors, numbering nearly six thousand of all ranks, had, finding\r\ntheir urgent appeal to their forces at Airdrie met with no response, and\r\nimagining that they too had been defeated, at last surrendered, and were\r\ntaken prisoners.\r\n\r\n\"On receipt of this intelligence, Colonel Cumberland executed a\r\nmanoeuvre that was a marvel of forethought and smartness. The appeal to\r\nAirdrie for help had, of course, not been received, but in its place he\r\nordered a message in Russian to be sent along the enemy's field\r\ntelegraph to the force advancing on Glasgow in the following words:\r\n'Remain at Airdrie. Do not advance on Glasgow before we join you. The\r\ndefenders are defeated with heavy losses everywhere. Our advance guard\r\nwill be with you in twenty-four hours. Signed--Drukovitch.'\r\n\r\n\"This having been despatched, he reported by telegraph to the\r\nheadquarters at Carstairs what he had done, and then our whole force\r\nimmediately moved as far as Bellshill, in the direction of Glasgow. Here\r\nwe came across the Russian outposts, and a sharp fight ensued. After\r\nhalf an hour, however, we succeeded in cutting them off and totally\r\nannihilating them, afterwards establishing ourselves in Bellshill until\r\nreinforcements could arrive. We were now only six miles from the Russian\r\nheadquarters at Airdrie, and they, on receipt of our fictitious message,\r\nhad withdrawn from the Clyde bank, and extended farther north over the\r\nhills as far as Milngavie.\r\n\r\n\"We were thus enabled to watch and wait in Bellshill undisturbed\r\nthroughout the night; and while the enemy were eagerly expecting their\r\nlegions of infantry who were to swoop down and conquer Glasgow, we\r\nremained content in the knowledge that the hour of conquest was close at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"A short, hasty rest, and we were astir again long before the dawn. Just\r\nat daybreak, however, the advance guard of our force from Carstairs,\r\nwhich had been on the march during the night, came into touch with us,\r\nand in an hour the combined right and centre divisions of the British\r\nhad opened the battle.\r\n\r\n\"Our fighting front extended from Wishaw right across to Condorrat, with\r\nbatteries on Torrance and the hill at New Monkland, while another strong\r\nline was pushed across from Cambuslang to Parkhead, and thence to\r\nMillerston, for the protection of Glasgow.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, almost before our guns uttered their voice of defiance, we had\r\nsurrounded the enemy, and throughout the morning the fighting was most\r\nsanguinary and desperate. Our batteries did excellent service; still, it\r\nmust be remembered we had attacked a well-trained force of over thirty\r\nthousand men, and they had many more guns than we possessed. No doubt\r\nthe fictitious despatch we had sent had prevented the Russian commander\r\nfrom advancing on Glasgow during the night, as he had intended; and now,\r\nfinding himself so vigorously attacked by two divisions which he\r\nbelieved had been cut up and annihilated, all his calculations were\r\ncompletely upset.\r\n\r\n\"It was well for us that this was so, otherwise we might have fared much\r\nworse than we did. As it was, Cossacks and Dragoons wrought frightful\r\nhavoc among our infantry; while, on the other hand, the fire discipline\r\nof the latter was magnificent. Every bit of cover on the hills seem to\r\nbristle with hidden rifles, that emptied their magazines without smoke\r\nand with fatal effect. Many a gallant dash was made by our men, the\r\nVolunteers especially displaying conspicuous courage. The 1st\r\nDumbartonshire Volunteers, under Col. Thomson, V.D., the 1st\r\nRenfrewshire, under Col. Lamont, V.D., and the 4th Battalion Argyll and\r\nSutherland Highlanders, under Col. D. M'Fayden, V.D., operated together\r\nwith magnificent success, for they completely cut up a strong Russian\r\ndetachment on the Glasgow road beyond Uddingston, driving them out of\r\nthe wood near Daldowie, and there annihilating them, and afterwards\r\nholding their own on the banks of the North Calder without suffering\r\nvery much loss. They handled their Maxims as smartly as any body of\r\nRegulars; and indeed, throughout the day their performances everywhere\r\nwere marked by steady discipline and cool courage that was in the\r\nhighest degree commendable.\r\n\r\n\"About two o'clock in the afternoon the battle was at its height. Under\r\nthe blazing sun that beat down upon us mercilessly, my battalion fought\r\non, feeling confident that the enemy were gradually being defeated. The\r\nslaughter everywhere was frightful, and the green hillsides and fields\r\nwere covered with dead and dying soldiers of the Tsar. The grey coats\r\nwere soaked with blood, and dark, ugly stains dyed the grass of the\r\nfertile meadows beside the winding Clyde. Since their sudden landing in\r\nScotland, the enemy's early successes had been followed by defeat after\r\ndefeat. Their transports had been destroyed, their ammunition and stores\r\nseized, both their 2nd and 3rd Army Corps had been totally annihilated,\r\nleaving nearly twelve thousand men in our hands as prisoners, and now\r\nthe defeat of this force of picked regiments, who had, on landing,\r\nimmediately marched straight across Scotland, would effect a crushing\r\nand decisive blow.\r\n\r\n\"But the struggle was terrific, the din deafening, the wholesale\r\nbutchery appalling. Our men knew they were fighting for Caledonia and\r\ntheir Queen, and their conduct, from the first moment of hostilities,\r\nuntil stray bullets laid them low one after another, was magnificent;\r\nthey were splendid examples of the true, loyal, and fearless Briton, who\r\nwill fight on even while his life-blood ebbs.\r\n\r\n\"Evening fell, but the continuous firing did not cease. The sun sank red\r\nand angry into dark storm-clouds behind the long range of purple hills\r\nbeyond the Clyde, but the clash of arms continued over hill and dale on\r\nthe east of Glasgow, and we, exerting every effort in our successful\r\nattempt to hold the five converging roads near Broomhouse, knew not\r\nwhich side were victors.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly I received orders to send over a small detachment to block the\r\ntwo roads at Baillieston, the one a main road leading up from\r\nCoatbridge, and the other from the hilly country around Old Monkland,\r\nwhere the struggle was fiercest. Sending Lieutenant Planck over\r\nimmediately with a detachment and several cyclists, I followed as soon\r\nas possible, and found he had blocked both roads in the centre of the\r\nlittle Scotch village, and had occupied the inn situated between the two\r\nroads, leaving just sufficient space for his cyclists to pass. Looking\r\ntowards the city we could see that the hills on our left were occupied\r\nby British redcoats. In the village the quaint little low-built\r\ncottages, with their stairs outside, were all closed and deserted, and\r\nthe place seemed strangely quiet after the exciting scenes and ceaseless\r\ndeafening din.\r\n\r\n\"Taking six of Planck's men and the cyclists about a mile towards\r\nCoatbridge, I posted them at the cross-roads beyond Rhind House, sending\r\nthe cyclists out along the valley to Dikehead. All was quiet in our\r\nimmediate vicinity for some time, until suddenly we discerned the\r\ncyclists coming back. They reported that they had seen cavalry. This,\r\nthen, must be a detachment of the enemy, who in all probability were\r\nretreating. I at once sent the cyclists back to inform Planck, and to\r\ntell him we should not take a hand in the game until we had allowed them\r\nto pass and they had discovered his barricade. In a few minutes we could\r\ndistinctly hear them approaching. We were all well under cover, but I\r\nwas surprised to find that it was only an escort.\r\n\r\n\"They were galloping, and had evidently come a long distance by some\r\ncircuitous route, and had not taken part in the fighting. I counted\r\nfive--two Cossacks in advance, then about forty yards behind a\r\nshabbily-dressed civilian on horseback, and about forty yards behind him\r\ntwo more Cossacks. They appeared to expect no interruption, and it\r\noccurred to me that the Cossacks were escorting the civilian over to the\r\nRussian position away beyond Hogganfield Loch. As soon as they were\r\nclear, I formed my men up on each side of the road to await events.\r\n\r\n\"We had no occasion to remain long in expectation, for soon afterwards\r\nthe stillness was broken by shouts and a few rapid shots, and then we\r\ncould hear two horses galloping back. One was riderless, and a corporal\r\nwho attempted to stop it was knocked down and seriously injured; but the\r\nother had a rider, and as he neared us I could see he was the civilian.\r\nI knew I must stop him at all costs.\r\n\r\n\"So, ordering the men on the opposite side of the road to lie down, we\r\ngave him a section volley from one side as he rushed past. The horse was\r\nbadly hit, and stumbled, throwing its rider, who was at once secured. To\r\nprevent him from disposing of anything, we bound him securely. Two of\r\nthe Cossacks had been shot and the other two captured. Upon the\r\ncivilian, and in his saddle-bags, we found a number of cipher\r\ndespatches, elaborate plans showing how Glasgow was defended, and an\r\nautograph letter from the Russian General Drukovitch, giving him\r\ninstructions to enter Glasgow alone by way of Partick, and to await him\r\nthere until the city fell.\r\n\r\n\"But the city was never invested. An hour after we had sent this\r\nmysterious civilian--who spoke English with a foreign accent--over to\r\nthe Colonel, our onslaught became doubly desperate. In the dusk,\r\nregiment after regiment of Russians were simply swept away by the cool\r\nand deliberate fire of the British, who, being reinforced by my\r\nbattalion and others, wrought splendid execution in the enemy's main\r\nbody, forced back upon us at Baillieston.\r\n\r\n\"Then, as night fell, a report was spread that General Drukovitch had\r\nsurrendered. This proved true. With his 2nd and 3rd Army Corps\r\nannihilated, and his transports and base in our hands, he was compelled\r\nto acknowledge himself vanquished; therefore, by nine o'clock\r\nhostilities had ceased, and during that night nearly six thousand\r\nsurvivors of the 1st Russian Army Corps were taken prisoners, and\r\nmarched in triumph into Glasgow amid the wildest excitement of the\r\npopulace. This desperate attempt to invest Glasgow had cost the Russians\r\nno fewer than 25,000 men in killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n\"The capture we effected near Baillieston turned out to be of a most\r\nimportant character. When searched at headquarters, a visiting-card was\r\nfound concealed upon the man, and this gave our Colonel a clue. The man\r\nhas since been identified by one of his intimate friends as a person\r\nwell known in London society, who poses as a wealthy German, the\r\nCount von Beilstein! It is alleged that he has for several years been\r\nliving in the metropolis and acting as an expert spy in the Secret\r\nService of the Tsar. He was sent handcuffed, under a strong escort, to\r\nLondon a few days after the battle, and if all I hear be true, some\r\nhighly sensational disclosures will be made regarding his adventurous\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEFEAT OF THE RUSSIANS AT BAILLIESTON, NEAR GLASGOW.]\r\n\r\n\"But throughout Caledonia there is now unbounded joy. Our beloved\r\ncountry is safe; for, thanks to the gallant heroism of our Volunteers,\r\nthe Muscovite invaders have been completely wiped out, and Scotland\r\nagain proudly rears her head.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nMARCH OF THE FRENCH ON LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth of the Thames, where the gigantic force of French and Russians,\r\nnumbering nearly two hundred thousand of all arms, had been prevented\r\nfrom attacking London by our Volunteers and Regulars massed along the\r\nSurrey Hills, the slaughter on both sides had been frightful. The\r\nstruggle was indeed not for a dynasty, but for the very existence of\r\nBritain as an independent nation.\r\n\r\nSussex had been devastated, but Kent still held out, and Chatham\r\nremained in the possession of the defenders.\r\n\r\nThe rout of the British at Horsham prior to the march of the left column\r\nof invaders to Birmingham was succeeded by defeat after defeat, the\r\nengagements each day illustrating painfully that by force of\r\noverwhelming numbers the invaders were gradually nearing their goal--the\r\nmighty Capital of our Empire.\r\n\r\nGallant stands were made by our Regulars at East Grinstead, Crawley,\r\nAlfold, and from Haslemere across Hind Head Common to Frensham. At each\r\nof these places, long, desperately-fought battles with the French had\r\ntaken place through the hot September days,--our Regular forces\r\nconfident in the stubborn resistance that would be offered by the long\r\nunbroken line of Volunteers occupying the range of hills behind. Our\r\nsignallers had formed a long line of stations from Reculvers and Star\r\nHill, south of the Medway Fortress, to Blue Bell Hill, between Chatham\r\nand Maidstone, thence through Snodland, Wrotham, Westerham, and\r\nLimpsfield to Caterham, and from there on through Reigate Park, Boxhill,\r\nSt. Martha's, and over the Hog's Back to Aldershot. With flags in day\r\nand lamps by night messages constantly passed, and communication was\r\nthus maintained by this means as well as by the field telegraph, which,\r\nhowever, on several occasions had been cut by the enemy.\r\n\r\nYet although our soldiers fought day after day with that pluck\r\ncharacteristic of the true Briton, fortune nevertheless seemed to have\r\nforsaken us, and even although we inflicted frightful losses upon the\r\nFrench all round, still they gradually forced back the defenders over\r\nthe Surrey border. Terror, ruin, and death had been spread by the\r\ninvading Gauls. English homes were sacked, French soldiers bivouaced in\r\nSussex pastures, and the ripening corn was trodden down and stained with\r\nblood. The white dusty highways leading from London to the sea were\r\npiled with unheeded corpses that were fearful to gaze upon, yet\r\nBritannia toiled on undaunted in this desperate struggle for the\r\nretention of her Empire.\r\n\r\nAfter our defeat at Horsham, the Russians had contented themselves by\r\nmerely driving back the defenders to a line of resistance from Aldershot\r\nto the north of Bagshot, and then they had marched onward to Birmingham.\r\nFrom Horsham, however, two columns of the invaders, mostly French, and\r\nnumbering over twenty thousand each, had advanced on Guildford and\r\nDorking. At the same time, a strong demonstration was made by the enemy\r\nin the country north of Eastbourne and Hailsham, by which the whole of\r\nthe district in the triangle from Bexhill to Heathfield, and thence to\r\nCuckfield and Steyning, fell into their hands. The British, however, had\r\nmassed a strong force to prevent the enemy making their way into West\r\nKent, and still held their own along the hills stretching from\r\nCrowborough to Ticehurst, and from Etchingham, through Brightling and\r\nAshburnham, down to Battle and Hastings.\r\n\r\nThe north of London had during the weeks of hostilities been strongly\r\nguarded by Volunteers and Regulars, for information of a contemplated\r\nlanding in Essex had been received; and although the defenders had not\r\nyet fired a shot, they were eagerly looking forward to a chance of\r\nproving their worth, as their comrades in other parts of England had\r\nalready done.\r\n\r\nAt first the tactics of the invaders could not be understood, for it had\r\nbeen concluded that they would naturally follow up their successes on\r\nlanding with a rapid advance on London.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, evident that the vigorous demonstrations made in the\r\nNorth and other parts of Britain were intended with a view to drawing as\r\nmany troops as possible from the defence of London, and dispose of them\r\nin detail before surrounding the capital. Yet, to the dismay of the\r\nenemy, no blow they delivered in other parts of our country had had the\r\ndesired effect of weakening the defensive lines around London. At the\r\nopening of the campaign it had been the enemy's intention to reduce\r\nLondon by a blockade, which could perhaps have been successfully carried\r\nout had they landed a strong force in Essex. The troops who were\r\nintended to land there were, however, sent to Scotland instead, and the\r\nfact that they had been annihilated outside Glasgow resulted in a\r\ndecision to march at once upon the metropolis.\r\n\r\nAdvancing from Horsham, the French right column, numbering 20,000 men\r\nwith about 70 guns, had, after desperate fighting, at last reached\r\nLeatherhead, having left a battalion in support at Dorking. The British\r\nhad resolutely contested every step the French had advanced, and the\r\nslaughter around Dorking had been awful, while the fighting across\r\nFetcham Downs and around Ockley and Bear Green had resulted in frightful\r\nloss on both sides.\r\n\r\nOur Regulars and Volunteers, notwithstanding their gallantry, were,\r\nalas! gradually driven back by the enormous numbers that had commenced\r\nthe onslaught, and were at last thrown back westward in disorder,\r\nhalting at Ripley. Here the survivors snatched a hasty rest, and they\r\nwere during the night reinforced by a contingent of Regulars who had\r\ncome over from Windsor and Hounslow. On the arrival of these\r\nreinforcements, the Colonel, well knowing how serious was the situation\r\nnow our first line of defence had been broken, sent out a flying column\r\nfrom Ripley, while the main body marched to Great Bookham, with the\r\nresult that Leatherhead, now in the occupation of the French, was from\r\nboth sides vigorously attacked. The British flying column threatening\r\nthe enemy from the north was, however, quickly checked by the French\r\nguns, and in the transmission of an order a most serious blunder\r\noccurred, leading to the impossibility of a retreat upon Ripley, for\r\nunfortunately the order, wrongly given, resulted in the blowing up by\r\nmistake of the bridges over the river Mole by which they had crossed,\r\nand which they wanted to use again.\r\n\r\nThus it was that for a time this force was compelled to remain, at\r\nterrible cost, right under the fire of the French entrenched position at\r\nLeatherhead; but the enemy were fortunately not strong enough to follow\r\nup this advantage, and as they occupied a strong strategical position\r\nthey were content to await the arrival of their huge main body, now on\r\nthe move, and which they expected would reach Leatherhead during that\r\nnight. After more fierce fighting, lasting one whole breathless day, the\r\ndefenders were annihilated, while their main body approaching from the\r\nsouth also fell into a trap. For several hours a fierce battle also\r\nraged between Dorking and Mickleham. The British battery on Box Hill\r\nwrought awful havoc in the French lines, yet gradually the enemy\r\nsilenced our guns and cut up our forces.\r\n\r\nThe invaders were now advancing in open order over the whole of Sussex\r\nand the west of Kent, and on the same day as the battle was fought at\r\nLeatherhead, the high ground south of Sevenoaks, extending from Wimlet\r\nHill to Chart Common, fell into their hands, the British suffering\r\nseverely; while two of our Volunteer batteries in the vicinity were\r\nsurprised and seized by a French flying column.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, another French column, numbering nearly twenty thousand\r\ninfantry and cavalry, had advanced from Alfold, burning Ewhurst and\r\nCranley, and after a desperately-contested engagement they captured the\r\nBritish batteries on the hills at Hascombe and Hambledon.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the French advance guard, though suffering terrible\r\nloss, successfully attacked the battery of Regulars on the hill at\r\nWonersh, and Godalming having been invested, they commenced another\r\nvigorous attack upon the strong line of British Regulars and Volunteers\r\nat Guildford, where about fourteen thousand men were massed.\r\n\r\nOn the hills from Gomshall to Seale our brave civilian defenders had\r\nremained throughout the hostilities ready to repel any attack. Indeed,\r\nas the days passed, and no demonstration had been made in their\r\ndirection, they had grown impatient, until at length this sudden and\r\nferocious onslaught had been made, and they found themselves face to\r\nface with an advancing army of almost thrice their strength. Among the\r\nVolunteer battalions holding the position were the 1st Bucks, under Lord\r\nAddington, V.D.; the 2nd Oxfordshire Light Infantry, under Col. H. S.\r\nHall; the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Bedfordshire Regiment, under Col. A. M.\r\nBlake, Lieut.-Col. Rumball, and Col. J. T. Green, V.D.; the 1st Royal\r\nBerkshire, under Col. J. C. Carter; the 1st Somersetshire Light\r\nInfantry, under Col. H. M. Skrine, V.D.; and the 1st and 2nd Wiltshire,\r\nunder the Earl of Pembroke, V.D., and Col. E. B. Merriman, V.D. Strong\r\nbatteries had been established between Guildford and Seale by the 1st\r\nFifeshire Artillery, under Col. J. W. Johnston, V.D., and the Highland\r\nArtillery, under Col. W. Fraser, V.D.; while batteries on the left were\r\nheld by the 1st Midlothian, under Col. Kinnear, V.D.; the 1st East\r\nRiding, under Col. R. G. Smith, V.D.; and the 1st West Riding, under\r\nCol. T. W. Harding, V.D.\r\n\r\nCommencing before dawn, the battle was fierce and sanguinary almost from\r\nthe time the first shots were exchanged. The eight 60-pounder guns in\r\nthe new fort at the top of Pewley Hill, manned by the Royal Artillery,\r\ncommanded the valleys lying away to the south, and effected splendid\r\ndefensive work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH VOLUNTEER POSITIONS ON THE SURREY HILLS.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was this redoubt, with three new ones between Guildford and\r\nGomshall, and another on the Hog's Back, which held the enemy in check\r\nfor a considerable time; and had there been a larger number of a similar\r\nstrength, it is doubtful whether the French would ever have accomplished\r\ntheir design upon Guildford.\r\n\r\nThe Pewley Fort, built in the solid chalk, and surrounded by a wide\r\nditch, kept up a continuous fire upon the dense masses of the enemy, and\r\nswept away hundreds of unfortunate fellows as they rushed madly onward;\r\nwhile the Volunteer batteries and the Maxims of the infantry battalions\r\npoured upon the invaders a devastating hail of lead.\r\n\r\nFrom Farnham, the line through Odiham and Aldershot was held by a force\r\nincreasing hourly in strength; therefore the enemy were unable to get\r\nover to Farnborough to outflank the defenders. Through that brilliant,\r\nsunny September day the slaughter was terrible in every part of the\r\nenemy's column, and it was about noon believed that they would find\r\ntheir positions at Wonersh and Godalming untenable.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, with a dogged persistency unusual to our Gallic\r\nneighbours, they continued to fight with unquelled vigour. The 2nd\r\nOxfordshire Light Infantry and the 1st and 2nd Wiltshire, holding very\r\nimportant ground over against Puttenham, bore their part with\r\nmagnificent courage, but were at length cut up in a most horrible\r\nmanner; while the 1st Bedfordshire, who, with a body of Regulars\r\nvaliantly held the road running over the hills from Gomshall to Merrow,\r\nfought splendidly; but they too were, alas! subsequently annihilated.\r\n\r\nOver hill and dale, stretching away to the Sussex border, the rattle and\r\ndin of war sounded incessantly, and as hour after hour passed, hundreds\r\nof Britons and Frenchmen dyed the brown, sun-baked grass with their\r\nblood. The struggle was frightful. Volunteer battalions who had\r\nmanoeuvred over that ground at many an Eastertide had little dreamed\r\nthat they would have one day to raise their rifles in earnest for the\r\ndefence of their home and Queen. Yet the practice they had had now\r\nserved them well, for in one instance the 1st Berkshire succeeded by a\r\nvery smart manoeuvre in totally sweeping away several troops of\r\nCuirassiers, while a quarter of an hour later half an infantry battalion\r\nof Regulars attacked a large force of Zouaves on the Compton Road, and\r\nfought them successfully almost hand to hand.\r\n\r\nThrough the long, toilsome day the battle continued with unabated fury,\r\nand as the sun went down there was no cessation of hostilities. A force\r\nof our Regulars, extending from Farnham over Hind Head Common, fell\r\nsuddenly upon a large body of French infantry, and, outflanking them,\r\nmanaged--after a most frightful encounter, in which they lost nearly\r\nhalf their men--to totally annihilate them.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this incident, a squadron of the 5th Dragoon Guards\r\nmade a magnificent charge up a steep hill literally to the muzzles of\r\nthe guns of a French battery, and by their magnificent pluck captured\r\nit. Still, notwithstanding the bravery of our defenders, and their\r\nfierce determination to sweep away their foe, it seemed when the sun\r\nfinally disappeared that the fortunes of war were once more against us,\r\nfor the French had now received huge reinforcements, and Dorking and\r\nLeatherhead having already passed into their hands two days previously,\r\nthey were enabled to make their final assault a most savage and terrific\r\none.\r\n\r\nIt was frightful; it crushed us! In the falling gloom our men fought\r\ndesperately for their lives, but, alas! one after another our positions\r\nwere carried by the invaders literally at the point of the bayonet, and\r\nere the moon rose Guildford had fallen into the enemy's hands, and our\r\ndepleted battalions had been compelled to retire in disorder east to\r\nEffingham and west to Farnham. Those who went to Effingham joined at\r\nmidnight the column who had made an unsuccessful effort to recover\r\nLeatherhead, and then bivouaced in Oldlands Copse. The number of wounded\r\nin the battles of Guildford and Leatherhead was enormous. At Mickleham\r\nthe British hospital flag floated over St. Michael's Church, the Priory\r\nat Cherkley, Chapel Farm, and on Mickleham Hall, a portion of which\r\nstill remained intact, although the building had been looted by Zouaves.\r\nIn Leatherhead the French had established hospitals at Givons Grove,\r\nVale Lodge, Elmbank, and in the Church of St. Mary and the parish church\r\nat Fetcham. At Guildford, in addition to the field hospitals on Albury\r\nDowns and behind St. Catherine's Hill, Holden, Warren, and Tyting Farms,\r\nSutton Place and Loseley were filled with wounded French infantrymen and\r\nBritish prisoners, and many schools and buildings, including the\r\nGuildhall in Guildford town, bore the red cross.\r\n\r\nAt two most important strategic points the first line defending London\r\nhad now been broken, and the British officers knew that it would require\r\nevery effort on our part to recover our lost advantages. The metropolis\r\nwas now seriously threatened; for soon after dawn on the following day\r\ntwo great French columns, one from Guildford and the other from\r\nLeatherhead, were advancing north towards the Thames! The enemy had\r\nestablished telegraphic communication between the two towns, and\r\nballoons that had been sent up from Guildford and Ashstead to\r\nreconnoitre had reported that the second line of the British defence had\r\nbeen formed from Kingston, through Wimbledon, Tooting, Streatham, and\r\nUpper Norwood, and thence across _via_ Sydenham to Lewisham and\r\nGreenwich.\r\n\r\nIt was upon this second line of defence that the French, with their\r\nenormous force of artillery, now marched. The Leatherhead column, with\r\ntheir main body about one day's march behind, took the route through\r\nEpsom to Mitcham, while the troops from Guildford pushed on through\r\nRipley, Cobham, and Esher.\r\n\r\nThis advance occupied a day, and when a halt was made for the night the\r\nenemy's front extended from Walton to Thames Ditton, thence across\r\nKingston Common and Malden to Mitcham. Bivouacing, they faced the\r\nBritish second line of defence, and waited for the morrow to commence\r\ntheir onslaught. In London the alarming news of the enemy's success\r\ncaused a panic such as had never before been experienced in the\r\nmetropolis. During the long anxious weeks that the enemy had been held\r\nwithin bounds by our Volunteers, London had never fully realised what\r\nbombardment would mean. While the French were beyond the Surrey Hills,\r\nLondoners felt secure; and the intelligence received of the enemy's\r\nutter rout at Newcastle, Manchester, Edinburgh, and Glasgow added\r\nconsiderably to this sense of security.\r\n\r\nLondon, alas! was starving. Business was suspended; trains no longer\r\nleft the termini; omnibuses, trams, and cabs had ceased running, the\r\nhorses having been pressed into military service, and those which had\r\nnot had been killed and eaten. The outlook everywhere, even during those\r\nblazing sunny days and clear moonlit nights, was cheerless and\r\ndispiriting. The bright sun seemed strangely incongruous with the black\r\nwar-clouds that overhung the gigantic city, with its helpless, starving,\r\nbreathless millions.\r\n\r\nIn the sun-baked, dusty streets the roar of traffic no longer sounded,\r\nbut up and down the principal thoroughfares of the City and the West End\r\nthe people prowled, lean and hungry--emaciated victims of this awful\r\nstruggle between nations--seeking vainly for food to satisfy the\r\nterrible pangs consuming them. The hollow cheek, the thin, sharp nose,\r\nthe dark-ringed glassy eye of one and all, told too plainly of the\r\nwidespread suffering, and little surprise was felt at the great\r\nmortality in every quarter.\r\n\r\nIn Kensington and Belgravia the distress was quite as keen as in\r\nWhitechapel and Hackney, and both rich and poor mingled in the gloomy,\r\ndismal streets, wandering aimlessly over the great Modern Babylon, which\r\nthe enemy were now plotting to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of those intensely anxious days of terror were unspeakable.\r\nThe whole machinery of life in the Great City had been disorganised, and\r\nnow London lay like an octopus, with her long arms extended in every\r\ndirection, north and south of the Thames, inert, helpless, trembling.\r\nOver the gigantic Capital of the World hung the dark Shadow of Death. By\r\nday and by night its ghastly presence could be felt; its hideous\r\nrealities crushed the heart from those who would face the situation with\r\nsmiling countenance. London's wealth availed her not in this critical\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nGrim, spectral, unseen, the Destroying Angel held the sword over her,\r\nready to strike!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nLOOTING IN THE SUBURBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile famished men crept into Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens and there\r\nexpired under the trees of absolute hunger, and starving women with\r\nbabes at their breasts sank upon doorsteps and died, the more robust\r\nLondoners had, on hearing of the enemy's march on the metropolis, gone\r\nsouth to augment the second line of defence. For several weeks huge\r\nbarricades had been thrown up in the principal roads approaching London\r\nfrom the south. The strongest of these were opposite the Convalescent\r\nHome on Kingston Hill, in Coombe Lane close to Raynes Park Station, in\r\nthe Morden Road at Merton Abbey, opposite Lynwood in the Tooting Road;\r\nwhile nearer London, on the same road, there was a strong one with\r\nmachine guns on the crest of Balham Hill, and another in Clapham Road.\r\nAt Streatham Hill, about one hundred yards from the hospital, earthworks\r\nhad been thrown up, and several guns brought into position; while at\r\nBeulah Hill, Norwood, opposite the Post Office at Upper Sydenham, at the\r\nHalf Moon at Herne Hill, and in many of the roads between Honor Oak and\r\nDenmark Hill, barricades had been constructed and banked up with bags\r\nand baskets filled with earth.\r\n\r\nThough these defences were held by enthusiastic civilians of all\r\nclasses,--professional men, artisans, and tradesmen,--yet our second\r\nline of defence, distinct, of course, from the local barricades, was a\r\nvery weak one. We had relied upon our magnificent strategic positions on\r\nthe Surrey Hills, and had not made sufficient provision in case of a\r\nsudden reverse. Our second line, stretching from Croydon up to South\r\nNorwood, thence to Streatham and along the railway line to Wimbledon and\r\nKingston, was composed of a few battalions of Volunteers, detachments of\r\nMetropolitan police, Berks and Bucks constabulary, London firemen and\r\npostmen, the Corps of Commissionaires--in fact, every body of drilled\r\nmen who could be requisitioned to handle revolver or rifle. These were\r\nbacked by great bodies of civilians, and behind stood the barricades\r\nwith their insignificant-looking but terribly deadly machine guns.\r\n\r\nThe railways had, on the first news of the enemy's success at\r\nLeatherhead and Guildford, all been cut up, and in each of the many\r\nbridges spanning the Thames between Kingston and the Tower great charges\r\nof gun-cotton had been placed, so that they might be blown up at any\r\ninstant, and thus prevent the enemy from investing the city.\r\n\r\nDay dawned again at last--dull and grey. It had rained during the night,\r\nand the roads, wet and muddy, were unutterably gloomy as our civilian\r\ndefenders looked out upon them, well knowing that ere long a fierce\r\nattack would be made. In the night the enemy had been busy laying a\r\nfield telegraph from Mitcham to Kingston, through which messages were\r\nnow being continually flashed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, just as the British outposts were being relieved, the French\r\ncommenced a vigorous attack, and in a quarter of an hour fighting\r\nextended along the whole line. Volunteers, firemen, policemen,\r\nCommissionaires, and civilians all fought bravely, trusting to one hope,\r\nnamely, that before they were defeated the enemy would be outflanked and\r\nattacked in their rear by a British force from the Surrey Hills. They\r\nwell knew that to effectually bar the advance of this great body of\r\nFrench was out of all question, yet they fought on with creditable tact,\r\nand in many instances inflicted serious loss upon the enemy's infantry.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, French field guns were trained upon them, and amid the\r\nroar of artillery line after line of heroic Britons fell shattered to\r\nearth. Amid the rattle of musketry, the crackling of the machine guns,\r\nand the booming of 16-pounders, brave Londoners struggled valiantly\r\nagainst the masses of wildly excited Frenchmen; yet every moment the\r\nline became slowly weakened, and the defenders were gradually forced\r\nback upon their barricades. The resistance which the French met with was\r\nmuch more determined than they had anticipated; in fact, a small force\r\nof Volunteers holding the Mitcham Road, at Streatham, fought with such\r\nsplendid bravery, that they succeeded alone and unaided in completely\r\nwiping out a battalion of French infantry, and capturing two field guns\r\nand a quantity of ammunition. For this success, however, they, alas!\r\npaid dearly, for a quarter of an hour later a large body of cavalry and\r\ninfantry coming over from Woodlands descended upon them and totally\r\nannihilated them, with the result that Streatham fell into the hands of\r\nthe French, and a few guns placed in the high road soon made short work\r\nof the earthworks near the hospital. Under the thick hail of bursting\r\nshells the brave band who manned the guns were at last compelled to\r\nabandon them, and the enemy were soon marching unchecked into Stockwell\r\nand Brixton, extending their right, with the majority of their\r\nartillery, across Herne Hill, Dulwich, and Honor Oak.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a desperate battle was being fought around Kingston. The\r\nbarricade on Kingston Hill held out for nearly three hours, but was at\r\nlast captured by the invaders, and of those who had manned it not a man\r\nsurvived. Mitcham and Tooting had fallen in the first hour of the\r\nengagement, the barricade at Lynwood had been taken, and hundreds of the\r\nhouses in Balham had been looted by the enemy in their advance into\r\nClapham.\r\n\r\nNearly the whole morning it rained in torrents, and both invaders and\r\ndefenders were wet to the skin, and covered with blood and mud.\r\nEverywhere British pluck showed itself in this desperate resistance on\r\nthe part of these partially-trained defenders. At the smaller\r\nbarricades in the suburban jerry-built streets, Britons held their own\r\nand checked the advance with remarkable coolness; yet, as the dark,\r\nstormy day wore on, the street defences were one after another broken\r\ndown and destroyed.\r\n\r\nIndeed, by three o'clock that afternoon the enemy ran riot through the\r\nwhole district, from Lower Sydenham to Kingston. Around the larger\r\nhouses on Sydenham Hill one of the fiercest fights occurred, but at\r\nlength the defenders were driven down into Lordship Lane, and the houses\r\non the hill were sacked, and some of them burned. While this was\r\nproceeding, a great force of French artillery came over from Streatham,\r\nand before dusk five great batteries had been established along the\r\nParade in front of the Crystal Palace, and on Sydenham Hill and One Tree\r\nHill; while other smaller batteries were brought into position at Forest\r\nHill, Gipsy Hill, Tulse Hill, Streatham Hill, and Herne Hill; and\r\nfurther towards London about twenty French 12-pounders and a number of\r\nnew quick-firing weapons of long range and a very destructive character\r\nwere placed along the top of Camberwell Grove and Denmark Hill.\r\n\r\nThe defences of London had been broken. The track of the invaders was\r\nmarked by ruined homes and heaps of corpses, and London's millions knew\r\non this eventful night that the enemy were now actually at their doors.\r\nIn Fleet Street, in the Strand, in Piccadilly, the news spread from\r\nmouth to mouth as darkness fell that the enemy were preparing to launch\r\ntheir deadly shells into the City. This increased the panic. The people\r\nwere in a mad frenzy of excitement, and the scenes everywhere were\r\nterrible. Women wept and wailed, men uttered words of blank despair, and\r\nchildren screamed at an unknown terror.\r\n\r\nThe situation was terrible. From the Embankment away on the Surrey side\r\ncould be seen a lurid glare in the sky. It was the reflection of a great\r\nfire in Vassall Road, Brixton, the whole street being burned by the\r\nenemy, together with the great block of houses lying between the Cowley\r\nand Brixton Roads.\r\n\r\nLondon waited. Dark storm-clouds scudded across the moon. The chill wind\r\nswept up the river, and moaned mournfully in doors and chimneys.\r\n\r\nAt last, without warning, just as Big Ben had boomed forth one o'clock,\r\nthe thunder of artillery shook the windows, and startled the excited\r\ncrowds. Great shells crashed into the streets, remained for a second,\r\nand then burst with deafening report and appalling effect.\r\n\r\nIn Trafalgar Square, Fleet Street, and the Strand the deadly projectiles\r\ncommenced to fall thickly, wrecking the shops, playing havoc with the\r\npublic buildings, and sweeping hundreds of men and women into eternity.\r\nNothing could withstand their awful force, and the people, rushing madly\r\nabout like frightened sheep, felt that this was indeed their last hour.\r\n\r\nIn Ludgate Hill the scene was awful. Shots fell with monotonous\r\nregularity, bursting everywhere, and blowing buildings and men into\r\natoms. The French shells were terribly devastating; the reek of melinite\r\npoisoned the air. Shells striking St. Paul's Cathedral brought down the\r\nright-hand tower, and crashed into the dome; while others set on fire a\r\nlong range of huge drapery warehouses behind it, the glare of the\r\nroaring flames causing the great black Cathedral to stand out in bold\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nThe bombardment had actually commenced! London, the proud Capital of the\r\nWorld, was threatened with destruction!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nLONDON BOMBARDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hand of the Destroyer had reached England's mighty metropolis. The\r\nlurid scene was appalling.\r\n\r\nIn the stormy sky the red glare from hundreds of burning buildings grew\r\nbrighter, and in every quarter flames leaped up and black smoke curled\r\nslowly away in increasing volume.\r\n\r\nThe people were unaware of the events that had occurred in Surrey that\r\nday. Exhausted, emaciated, and ashen pale, the hungry people had endured\r\nevery torture. Panic-stricken, they rushed hither and thither in\r\nthousands up and down the principal thoroughfares, and as they tore\r\nheadlong away in this _sauve qui peut_ to the northern suburbs, the\r\nweaker fell and were trodden under foot.\r\n\r\nMen fought for their wives and families, dragging them away out of the\r\nrange of the enemy's fire, which apparently did not extend beyond the\r\nline formed by the Hackney Road, City Road, Pentonville Road, Euston\r\nRoad, and Westbourne Park. But in that terrible rush to escape many\r\ndelicate ladies were crushed to death, and numbers of others, with their\r\nchildren, sank exhausted, and perished beneath the feet of the fleeing\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nNever before had such alarm been spread through London; never before had\r\nsuch awful scenes of destruction been witnessed. The French\r\nCommander-in-chief, who was senior to his Russian colleague, had been\r\nkilled, and his successor being unwilling to act in concert with the\r\nMuscovite staff, a quarrel ensued. It was this quarrel which caused the\r\nbombardment of London, totally against the instructions of their\r\nrespective Governments. The bombardment was, in fact, wholly\r\nunnecessary, and was in a great measure due to some confused orders\r\nreceived by the French General from his Commander-in-chief. Into the\r\nmidst of the surging, terrified crowds that congested the streets on\r\neach side of the Thames, shells filled with melinite dropped, and,\r\nbursting, blew hundreds of despairing Londoners to atoms. Houses were\r\nshattered and fell, public buildings were demolished, factories were set\r\nalight, and the powerful exploding projectiles caused the Great City to\r\nreel and quake. Above the constant crash of bursting shells, the dull\r\nroar of the flames, and the crackling of burning timbers, terrific\r\ndetonations now and then were heard, as buildings, filled with\r\ncombustibles, were struck by shots, and, exploding, spread death and\r\nruin over wide areas. The centre of commerce, of wealth, of intellectual\r\nand moral life was being ruthlessly wrecked, and its inhabitants\r\nmassacred. Apparently it was not the intention of the enemy to invest\r\nthe city at present, fearing perhaps that the force that had penetrated\r\nthe defences was not sufficiently large to accomplish such a gigantic\r\ntask; therefore they had commenced this terrible bombardment as a\r\npreliminary measure.\r\n\r\nThrough the streets of South London the people rushed along, all\r\nfootsteps being bent towards the bridges; but on every one of them the\r\ncrush was frightful--indeed, so great was it that in several instances\r\nthe stone balustrades were broken, and many helpless, shrieking persons\r\nwere forced over into the dark swirling waters below. The booming of the\r\nbatteries was continuous, the bursting of the shells was deafening, and\r\nevery moment was one of increasing horror. Men saw their homes swept\r\naway, and trembling women clung to their husbands, speechless with fear.\r\nIn the City, in the Strand, in Westminster, and West End streets the\r\nruin was even greater, and the destruction of property enormous.\r\n\r\nWestward, both great stations at Victoria, with the adjoining furniture\r\nrepositories and the Grosvenor Hotel, were burning fiercely; while the\r\nWellington Barracks had been partially demolished, and the roof of St.\r\nPeter's Church blown away. Two shells falling in the quadrangle of\r\nBuckingham Palace had smashed every window and wrecked some of the\r\nground-floor apartments, but nevertheless upon the flagstaff, amidst the\r\ndense smoke and showers of sparks flying upward, there still floated the\r\nRoyal Standard. St. James's Palace, Marlborough House, Stafford House,\r\nand Clarence House, standing in exposed positions, were being all more\r\nor less damaged; several houses in Carlton House Terrace had been\r\npartially demolished, and a shell striking the Duke of York's Column\r\nsoon after the commencement of the bombardment, caused it to fall,\r\nblocking Waterloo Place.\r\n\r\nTime after time shells whistled above and fell with a crash and\r\nexplosion, some in the centre of the road, tearing up the paving, and\r\nothers striking the clubs in Pall Mall, blowing out many of those noble\r\ntime-mellowed walls. The portico of the Athenaeum had been torn away like\r\npasteboard, the rear premises of the War Office had been pulverised, and\r\nthe Carlton, Reform, and United Service Clubs suffered terrible damage.\r\nTwo shells striking the Junior Carlton crashed through the roof, and\r\nexploding almost simultaneously, brought down an enormous heap of\r\nmasonry, which fell across the roadway, making an effectual barricade;\r\nwhile at the same moment shells began to fall thickly in Grosvenor Place\r\nand Belgrave Square, igniting many houses, and killing some of those who\r\nremained in their homes petrified by fear.\r\n\r\nUp Regent Street shells were sweeping with frightful effect. The Cafe\r\nMonico and the whole block of buildings surrounding it was burning, and\r\nthe flames leaping high, presented a magnificent though appalling\r\nspectacle. The front of the London Pavilion had been partially blown\r\naway, and of the two uniform rows of shops forming the Quadrant many\r\nhad been wrecked. From Air Street to Oxford Circus, and along Piccadilly\r\nto Knightsbridge, there fell a perfect hail of shell and bullets.\r\nDevonshire House had been wrecked, and the Burlington Arcade destroyed.\r\nThe thin pointed spire of St. James's Church had fallen, every window in\r\nthe Albany was shattered, several houses in Grosvenor Place had suffered\r\nconsiderably, and a shell that struck the southern side of St. George's\r\nHospital had ignited it, and now at 2 A.M., in the midst of this awful\r\nscene of destruction and disaster, the helpless sick were being removed\r\ninto the open streets, where bullets whistled about them and fragments\r\nof explosive shells whizzed past.\r\n\r\nAs the night wore on London trembled and fell. Once Mistress of the\r\nWorld, she was now, alas! sinking under the iron hand of the invader.\r\nUpon her there poured a rain of deadly missiles that caused appalling\r\nslaughter and desolation. The newly introduced long-range guns, and the\r\nterrific power of the explosives with which the French shells were\r\ncharged, added to the horrors of the bombardment; for although the\r\nbatteries were so far away as to be out of sight, yet the unfortunate\r\npeople, overtaken by their doom, were torn limb from limb by the\r\nbursting bombs.\r\n\r\nOver the roads lay men of London, poor and rich, weltering in their\r\nblood, their lower limbs shattered or blown completely away. With\r\nwide-open haggard eyes, in their death agony they gazed around at the\r\nburning buildings, at the falling debris, and upward at the\r\nbrilliantly-illumined sky. With their last breath they gasped prayers\r\nfor those they loved, and sank to the grave, hapless victims of\r\nBabylon's downfall.\r\n\r\nEvery moment the Great City was being devastated, every moment the\r\ncatastrophe was more complete, more awful. In the poorer quarters of\r\nSouth London whole streets were swept away, and families overwhelmed by\r\ntheir own demolished homes. Along the principal thoroughfares shop\r\nfronts were shivered, and the goods displayed in the windows strewn\r\nabout the roadway.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past three a frightful disaster occurred at Battersea. Very\r\nfew shells had dropped in that district, when suddenly one fell right in\r\nthe very centre of a great petroleum store. The effect was frightful.\r\nWith a noise that was heard for twenty miles around, the whole of the\r\ngreat store of oil exploded, blowing the stores themselves high into the\r\nair, and levelling all the buildings in the vicinity. In every direction\r\nburning oil was projected over the roofs of neighbouring houses, dozens\r\nof which at once caught fire, while down the streets there ran great\r\nstreams of blazing oil, which spread the conflagration in every\r\ndirection. Showers of sparks flew upwards, the flames roared and\r\ncrackled, and soon fires were breaking out in all quarters.\r\n\r\nJust as the clocks were striking a quarter to four, a great shell struck\r\nthe Victoria Tower of the Houses of Parliament, bringing it down with a\r\nterrific crash. This disaster was quickly followed by a series of\r\nothers. A shell fell through the roof of Westminster Abbey, setting the\r\ngrand old historic building on fire; another tore away the columns from\r\nthe front of the Royal Exchange; and a third carried away one of the\r\nsquare twin towers of St. Mary Woolnoth, at the corner of Lombard\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nAlong this latter thoroughfare banks were wrecked, and offices set on\r\nfire; while opposite, in the thick walls of the Bank of England, great\r\nbreaches were being made. The Mansion House escaped any very serious\r\ninjury, but the dome of the Stock Exchange was carried away; and in\r\nQueen Victoria Street, from end to end, enormous damage was caused to\r\nthe rows of fine business premises; while further east the Monument,\r\nbroken in half, came down with a noise like thunder, demolishing many\r\nhouses on Fish Street Hill.\r\n\r\nThe great drapery warehouses in Wood Street, Bread Street, Friday\r\nStreet, Foster Lane, and St. Paul's Churchyard suffered more or less.\r\nRyland's, Morley's, and Cook's were all alight and burning fiercely;\r\nwhile others were wrecked and shattered, and their contents blown out\r\ninto the streets. The quaint spire of St. Bride's had fallen, and its\r\nbells lay among the debris in the adjoining courts; both the\r\nhalf-wrecked offices of the _Daily Telegraph_ and the _Daily Chronicle_\r\nwere being consumed.\r\n\r\nThe great clock-tower of the Law Courts fell about four o'clock with a\r\nterrific crash, completely blocking the Strand at Temple Bar, and\r\ndemolishing the much-abused Griffin Memorial; while at the same moment\r\ntwo large holes were torn in the roof of the Great Hall, the small black\r\nturret above fell, and the whole of the glass in the building was\r\nshivered into fragments.\r\n\r\nIt was amazing how widespread was the ruin caused by each of the\r\nexplosive missiles. Considering the number of guns employed by the\r\nFrench in this cruel and wanton destruction of property, the desolation\r\nthey were causing was enormous. This was owing to the rapid extension of\r\ntheir batteries over the high ground from One Tree Hill through Peckham\r\nto Greenwich, and more especially to the wide ranges of their guns and\r\nthe terrific power of their shells. In addition to the ordinary\r\nprojectiles filled with melinite, charges of that extremely powerful\r\nsubstance lignine dynamite were hurled into the city, and, exploded by a\r\ndetonator, swept away whole streets, and laid many great public\r\nbuildings in ruins; while steel shells, filled with some arrangement of\r\nliquid oxygen and blasting gelatine, produced frightful effects, for\r\nnothing could withstand them.\r\n\r\nOne of these, discharged from the battery on Denmark Hill, fell in the\r\nquadrangle behind Burlington House, and levelled the Royal Academy and\r\nthe surrounding buildings. Again a terrific explosion sounded, and as\r\nthe smoke cleared it was seen that a gelatine shell had fallen among the\r\nmany turrets of the Natural History Museum, and the front of the\r\nbuilding fell out with a deafening crash, completely blocking the\r\nCromwell Road.\r\n\r\nLondon lay at the mercy of the invaders. So swiftly had the enemy cut\r\ntheir way through the defences and opened their hail of destroying\r\nmissiles, that the excited, starving populace were unaware of what had\r\noccurred until dynamite began to rain upon them. Newspapers had ceased\r\nto appear; and although telegraphic communication was kept up with the\r\ndefenders on the Surrey Hills by the War Office, yet no details of the\r\nevents occurring there had been made public for fear of spies. Londoners\r\nhad remained in ignorance, and, alas! had awaited their doom. Through\r\nthe long sultry night the situation was one of indescribable panic and\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nThe sky had grown a brighter red, and the streets within the range of\r\nthe enemy's guns, now deserted, were in most cases blocked by burning\r\nruins and fallen telegraph wires; while about the roadways lay the\r\nshattered corpses of men, women, and children, upon whom the shells had\r\nwrought their frightful work.\r\n\r\nThe bodies, mutilated, torn limb from limb, were sickening to gaze\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nBABYLON BURNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nDynamite had shattered Charing Cross Station and the Hotel, for its\r\nsmoke-begrimed facade had been torn out, and the station yard was filled\r\nwith a huge pile of smouldering debris. On either side of the Strand\r\nfrom Villiers Street to Temple Bar scarcely a window had been left\r\nintact, and the roadway itself was quite impassable, for dozens of\r\nbuildings had been overthrown by shells, and what in many cases had been\r\nhandsome shops were now heaps of bricks, slates, furniture, and twisted\r\ngirders. The rain of fire continued. Dense black smoke rising in a huge\r\ncolumn from St. Martin's Church showed plainly what was the fate of that\r\nnoble edifice, while fire had now broken out at the Tivoli Music Hall,\r\nand the clubs on Adelphi Terrace were also falling a prey to the flames.\r\n\r\nThe burning of Babylon was a sight of awful, appalling grandeur.\r\n\r\nThe few people remaining in the vicinity of the Strand who escaped the\r\nflying missiles and falling buildings, sought what shelter they could,\r\nand stood petrified by terror, knowing that every moment might be their\r\nlast, not daring to fly into the streets leading to Holborn, where they\r\ncould see the enemy's shells were still falling with unabated regularity\r\nand frightful result, their courses marked by crashing buildings and\r\nblazing ruins.\r\n\r\nLooking from Charing Cross, the Strand seemed one huge glaring furnace.\r\nFlames belched from windows on either side, and, bursting through roofs,\r\ngreat tongues of fire shot upwards; blazing timbers fell into the\r\nstreet; and as the buildings became gutted, and the fury of the\r\ndevouring element was spent, shattered walls tottered and fell into the\r\nroadway. The terrific heat, the roar of the flames, the blinding smoke,\r\nthe stifling fumes of dynamite, the pungent, poisonous odour of\r\nmelinite, the clouds of dust, the splinters of stone and steel, and the\r\nconstant bursting of shells, combined to render the scene the most awful\r\never witnessed in a single thoroughfare during the history of the world.\r\n\r\nFrom Kensington to Bow, from Camberwell to Somers Town, from Clapham to\r\nDeptford, the vast area of congested houses and tortuous streets was\r\nbeing swept continually. South of the Thames the loss of life was\r\nenormous, for thousands were unable to get beyond the zone of fire, and\r\nmany in Brixton, Clapham, Camberwell, and Kennington were either maimed\r\nby flying fragments of shell, buried in the debris of their homes, or\r\nburned to death. The disasters wrought by the Frenchmen's improved\r\nlong-range weapons were frightful.\r\n\r\nLondon, the all-powerful metropolis, which had egotistically considered\r\nherself the impregnable Citadel of the World, fell to pieces and was\r\nconsumed. She was frozen by terror, and lifeless. Her ancient monuments\r\nwere swept away, her wealth melted in her coffers, her priceless objects\r\nof art were torn up and broken, and her streets ran with the blood of\r\nher starving toilers.\r\n\r\nDay dawned grey, with stormlight gloom. Rain-clouds scudded swiftly\r\nacross the leaden sky. Along the road in front of the Crystal Palace,\r\nwhere the French batteries were established, the deafening discharges\r\nthat had continued incessantly during the night, and had smashed nearly\r\nall the glass in the sides and roof of the Palace, suddenly ceased.\r\n\r\nThe officers were holding a consultation over despatches received from\r\nthe batteries at Tulse Hill, Streatham, Red Post Hill, One Tree Hill,\r\nand Greenwich, all of which stated that ammunition had run short, and\r\nthey were therefore unable to continue the bombardment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRENCH BOMBARDING LONDON FROM THE CRYSTAL PALACE\r\nPARADE.]\r\n\r\nNeither of the ammunition trains of the two columns of the enemy had\r\narrived, for, although the bombarding batteries were unaware of it, both\r\nhad been captured and blown up by British Volunteers.\r\n\r\nIt was owing to this that the hostile guns were at last compelled to\r\ncease their thunder, and to this fact also was due the fortunes of the\r\ndefenders in the events immediately following.\r\n\r\nOur Volunteers occupying the line of defence north of London, through\r\nEpping and Brentwood to Tilbury, had for the past three weeks been in\r\ndaily expectation of an attempt on the part of the invaders to land in\r\nEssex, and were amazed at witnessing this sudden bombardment. From their\r\npositions on the northern heights they could distinctly see how\r\ndisastrous was the enemy's fire, and although they had been informed by\r\ntelegraph of the reverses we had sustained at Guildford and Leatherhead,\r\nyet they had no idea that the actual attack on the metropolis would be\r\nmade so swiftly. However, they lost not a moment. It was evident that\r\nthe enemy had no intention of effecting a landing in Essex; therefore,\r\nwith commendable promptitude, they decided to move across the Thames\r\nimmediately, to reinforce their comrades in Surrey. Leaving the 2nd and\r\n4th West Riding Artillery, under Col. Hoffmann and Col. N. Creswick,\r\nV.D., at Tilbury, and the Lincolnshire, Essex, and Worcestershire\r\nVolunteer Artillery, under Col. G. M. Hutton, V.D., Col. S. L. Howard,\r\nV.D., and Col. W. Ottley, the greater part of the Norfolk,\r\nStaffordshire, Tay, Aberdeen, Manchester, and Northern Counties Field\r\nBrigades moved south with all possible speed. From Brentwood, the 1st,\r\n2nd, 3rd, and 4th Volunteer Battalions of the Norfolk Regiment, under\r\nCol. A. C. Dawson, Col. E. H. H. Combe, Col. H. E. Hyde, V.D., and Col.\r\nC. W. J. Unthank, V.D.; the 1st and 2nd North Staffordshire, under Col.\r\nW. H. Dutton, V.D., and Col. F. D. Mort, V.D.; and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd\r\nSouth Staffordshire, under Col. J. B. Cochrane, V.D., Col. T. T. Fisher,\r\nV.D., and Col. E. Nayler, V.D.; the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Royal\r\nHighlanders, under Col. W. A. Gordon, V.D., Col. Sir R. D. Moncreiffe,\r\nCol. Sir R. Menzies, V.D., and Col. Erskine; the 7th Argyll and\r\nSutherland Highlanders, under Col. J. Porteous, V.D.; the 3rd, 4th, and\r\n5th Gordon Highlanders, under Col. A. D. Fordyce, Col. G. Jackson, V.D.,\r\nand Col. J. Johnston--were, as early as 2 A.M., on their way to London.\r\n\r\nAt this critical hour the Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps\r\nrendered invaluable services. Under the direction of Col. William Birt,\r\ntrains held in readiness by the Great Eastern Railway brought the\r\nbrigades rapidly to Liverpool Street, whence they marched by a\r\ncircuitous route beyond the zone of fire by way of Marylebone,\r\nPaddington, Kensington Gardens, Walham Green, and across Wandsworth\r\nBridge, thence to Upper Tooting, where they fell in with a large force\r\nof our Regular infantry and cavalry, who were on their way to outflank\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nAttacking a detachment of the French at Tooting, they captured several\r\nguns, destroyed the enemy's field telegraph, and proceeded at once to\r\nStreatham, where the most desperate resistance was offered. A fierce\r\nfight occurred across Streatham Common, and over to Lower Norwood and\r\nGipsy Hill, in which both sides lost very heavily. Nevertheless our\r\nVolunteers from Essex, although they had been on the march the greater\r\npart of the night, fought bravely, and inflicted terrible punishment\r\nupon their foe. The 3rd and 4th Volunteer Battalions of the Gordon\r\nHighlanders and the 1st Norfolk, attacking a French position near the\r\nmouth of the railway tunnel, displayed conspicuous bravery, and\r\nsucceeded in completely annihilating their opponents; while in an\r\nopposite direction, towards Tooting, several troops of French cavalry\r\nwere cut up and taken prisoners by two battalions of Royal Highlanders.\r\n\r\nThe batteries on Streatham Hill having been assaulted and taken, the\r\nforce of defenders pushed quickly onward to Upper Norwood, where our\r\ncavalry, sweeping along Westow Hill and Church Street, fell upon the\r\nbattery in front of the Crystal Palace. The enemy, owing to the\r\ninterruption of their field telegraph, were unaware of their presence,\r\nand were completely surprised. Nevertheless French infantrymen rushed\r\ninto the Crystal Palace Hotel, the White Swan, Stanton Harcourt, the\r\nKnoll, Rocklands, and other houses at both ends of the Parade, and from\r\nthe windows poured forth withering volleys from their Lebels. Our\r\ncavalry, riding down the broad Parade, used their sabres upon the\r\nartillerymen, and the whole of the French troops were quickly in a\r\nconfused mass, unable to act with effect, and suffering appallingly from\r\nthe steady fire of our Volunteers, who very soon cleared the enemy from\r\nthe White Swan, and, having been drawn up outside, poured forth a\r\ngalling rifle fire right along the enemy's position. Suddenly there was\r\nloud shouting, and the British \"Cease fire\" sounded. The French, though\r\nfighting hard, were falling back gradually down the hill towards\r\nSydenham Station, when suddenly shots were heard, and turbaned cavalry\r\ncame riding into them at a terrific pace from the rear.\r\n\r\nThe British officers recognised the new-comers as a squadron of Bengal\r\nLancers! At last India had sent us help, and our men sent up a loud\r\ncheer. A large force of cavalry and infantry, together with two\r\nregiments of Goorkas, had, it appeared, been landed at Sheerness. They\r\nhad contemplated landing in Hampshire, but, more unfortunate than some\r\nof their compatriots who had effected a landing near Southampton, they\r\nwere driven through the Straits of Dover by the enemy's cruisers.\r\nMarching north in company with a force from Chatham, they had earlier\r\nthat morning attacked and routed the enemy's right flank at Blackheath,\r\nand, after capturing the battery of the foe at Greenwich, greater part\r\nof the escort of which had been sent over to Lewisham an hour before,\r\nthey slaughtered a battalion of Zouaves, and had then extended across to\r\nDenmark Hill, where a sanguinary struggle occurred.\r\n\r\nThe French on Dog Kennel, Red Post, Herne, and Tulse Hills turned their\r\ndeadly machine guns upon them, and for a long time all the positions\r\nheld out. At length, however, by reason of a splendid charge made by the\r\nBengal Lancers, the battery at Red Post Hill was taken and the enemy\r\nslaughtered. During the next half-hour a fierce hand-to-hand struggle\r\ntook place up Dog Kennel Hill from St. Saviour's Infirmary, and\r\npresently, when the defenders gained the spur of the hill, they fought\r\nthe enemy gallantly in Grove Lane, Private Road, Bromar Road, Camberwell\r\nGrove, and adjoining roads. Time after time the Indian cavalry charged,\r\nand the Goorkas, with their keen knives, hacked their way into those of\r\nthe enemy who rallied. For nearly an hour the struggle continued\r\ndesperately, showers of bullets from magazine rifles sweeping along the\r\nusually quiet suburban thoroughfares, until the roads were heaped with\r\ndead and dying, and the houses on either side bore evidence of the\r\nbloody fray. Then at last the guns placed along the hills all fell into\r\nour hands, and the French were almost completely swept out of existence.\r\n\r\nMany were the terrible scenes witnessed in the gardens of the quaint\r\nlast-century houses on Denmark Hill. Around those old-world residences,\r\nstanding along the road leading down to Half Moon Lane, time-mellowed\r\nrelics of an age bygone, Indians fought with Zouaves, and British\r\nVolunteers struggled fiercely hand to hand with French infantrymen. The\r\nquiet old-fashioned quarter, that was an aristocratic retreat when\r\nCamberwell was but a sylvan village with an old toll gate, when cows\r\nchewed the cud upon Walworth Common, and when the Walworth Road had not\r\na house in the whole of it, was now the scene of a frightful massacre.\r\nThe deafening explosions of cordite from magazine rifles, the exultant\r\nshouts of the victors and the hoarse shrieks of the dying, awakened the\r\nechoes in those quaint old gardens, with their Dutch-cut zigzag walks,\r\nenclosed by ancient red brick walls, moss-grown, lichen covered, and\r\nhalf hidden by ivy, honeysuckle, and creepers. Those spacious grounds,\r\nwhere men were now being mercilessly slaughtered, had been the scene of\r\nmany a brilliant _fete champetre_, where splendid satin-coated _beaux_,\r\nall smiles and _ailes de pigeon_, whispered scandal behind the fans of\r\ndainty dames in high-dressed wigs and patches, or, clad as Watteau\r\nshepherds, had danced the _al fresco_ minuet with similarly attired\r\nshepherdesses, and later on played _piquet_ and drank champagne till\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOORKAS SLAUGHTERING THE FRENCH ARTILLERY AT GREENWICH\r\nOBSERVATORY.]\r\n\r\nIn the good old Georgian days, when Johnson walked daily under the trees\r\nin Gough Square, when Macklin was playing the \"Man of the World,\" and\r\nwhen traitors' heads blackened on Temple Bar, this colony was one of the\r\nmost rural, exclusive, and gay in the vicinity of London. Alas, how it\r\nhas decayed! Cheap \"desirable residences\" have sprung up around it, the\r\nhand of the jerry-building Vandal has touched it, the sound of traffic\r\nroars about it; yet still there is a charm in those quaint old gardens\r\nof a forgotten era. From under the dark yew hedges the jonquils still\r\npeep out early--the flowers themselves are those old-fashioned sweet\r\nones beloved of our grandmothers--and the tea roses still blossom on the\r\ncrumbling walls and fill the air with their fragrance. But in this\r\nterrible struggle the walls were used as defences, the bushes were torn\r\ndown and trampled under foot, and the flowers hung broken on their\r\nstalks, bespattered with men's blood!\r\n\r\nProceeding south again, the defenders successfully attacked the strong\r\nbatteries on One Tree Hill at Honor Oak, and on Sydenham Hill and Forest\r\nHill, and then extending across to the Crystal Palace, had joined hands\r\nwith our Volunteers from Essex, where they were now wreaking vengeance\r\nfor the ruthless destruction caused in London.\r\n\r\nThe bloodshed along the Crystal Palace Parade was fearful. The French\r\ninfantry and artillery, overwhelmed by the onward rush of the defenders,\r\nand now under the British crossfire, fell in hundreds. Dark-faced Bengal\r\nLancers and Goorkas, with British Hussars and Volunteers, descended upon\r\nthem with appalling swiftness; and so complete was the slaughter, that\r\nof the whole force that had effected that terribly effectual bombardment\r\nfrom Sydenham, not more than a dozen survived.\r\n\r\nBy noon many of the shops on Westow Hill and private residences on\r\nCollege Hill and Sydenham Hill had been wantonly ignited by the enemy;\r\nbut when the firing ceased some hours later, the roads were heaped with\r\nthe corpses of those whose mission it had been to destroy London.\r\n\r\nOf all those batteries which had caused such frightful desolation and\r\nloss of life during the night, not one now remained. The two French\r\ncolumns had been swiftly wiped out of existence; and although our forces\r\nhad suffered very considerably, they nevertheless were able to go south\r\nto Croydon later that afternoon, in order to take part in resisting the\r\nvigorous and desperate attack which they knew would sooner or later be\r\nmade by the whole French army massed beyond the Surrey Hills. The sun\r\nwas on the horizon, and the shadows were already deepening.\r\n\r\nAssistance had arrived tardily, for the damage to property in London\r\nduring the night had been enormous; nevertheless at this the eleventh\r\nhour we had inflicted upon the French a crushing defeat, and now England\r\nwaited, trembling and breathless, wondering what would be the final\r\noutcome of this fierce, bloody struggle for our national existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nFIGHTING ON THE SURREY HILLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur valiant defenders were striking swift, decisive blows for England's\r\nhonour. The French, demoralised by their severe defeat in the south of\r\nLondon, and suffering considerable loss in every other direction, fought\r\ndesperately during the two days following the disastrous bombardment.\r\n\r\nIn darkness and sunlight fierce contests took place along the Surrey\r\nHills, where our Volunteers, under Major-Gen. Lord Methuen, were still\r\nentrenched. Every copse bristled with rifles; red coats gleamed among\r\nthe foliage, and winding highways were, alas! strewn with corpses.\r\nGuildford had again been reoccupied by our Regulars, who were\r\nreorganising; and Leatherhead, holding out for another day, was retaken,\r\nafter a terribly hard-fought battle, by the Highland, South of Scotland,\r\nand Glasgow Brigades, with the 1st Ayrshire and Galloway Artillery,\r\nunder Col. J. G. Sturrock, V.D.; 1st Lanarkshire, under Col. R. J.\r\nBennett, V.D.; 1st Aberdeenshire, under Col. J. Ogston, V.D.; and 1st\r\nNorth Riding Yorkshire Volunteer Artillery, under Major C. L. Bell. In\r\nsuch a splendid and gallant manner had our comparatively small force\r\nmanoeuvred, that on the second night following the bombardment the whole\r\nof the invaders who had penetrated beyond our line of defence towards\r\nthe metropolis had been completely wiped out, in addition to which the\r\nbreach in our line had been filled up by strong reinforcements, and the\r\nenemy driven from the high ground between Box Hill and Guildford.\r\n\r\nThe invaders, finding how vigorously we repelled any attack, made\r\nterrific onslaughts on our position at various points they believed were\r\nvulnerable, but everywhere they were hurled back with appalling\r\nslaughter. Volunteers from Australia and the Cape, in addition to the\r\nother contingent of 10,000 Indian native troops, had been landed near\r\nSouthampton, and had advanced to assist in this terrific struggle, upon\r\nthe result of which the future of our Empire depended. Among these\r\nColonials were 500 Victorian Rangers, 900 Victoria Mounted Rifles, and\r\nseven companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry, with two ambulance\r\ncorps.\r\n\r\nThe Indians landed in splendid form, having brought their full war\r\nequipment with them without any contribution whatever from the Home\r\nGovernment, as it will be remembered they did when they landed at Malta\r\nduring Lord Beaconsfield's administration. Having received intelligence\r\nof the movements of the two columns of the enemy that had gone to London\r\nafter taking Leatherhead and Guildford, they pushed on to Petworth. By\r\nthe time they arrived there, however, both towns had been recaptured by\r\nthe British, who were then being severely harassed by the enemy massed\r\nalong the south side of our defensive line. Although numerically\r\ninferior to the enemy occupying that part of the country, the Indians\r\nwere already well accustomed to actual warfare, the majority having been\r\nengaged in operations against the hill tribes; therefore the commander\r\ndecided to push on at once, and endeavour to outflank the large French\r\nforce who with some Russian infantry had again attacked Guildford, and\r\nthe manner in which this was accomplished was a single illustration of\r\nthe valuable assistance the Indians rendered us in these days of\r\nbloodshed and despair.\r\n\r\nOne of the native officers of a Sikh regiment, the Subadar Banerji\r\nSingh, having served with Sir Peter Lumsden's expeditionary force some\r\nyears before, had frequently come into contact with the Russians, and\r\ncould speak Russian better than some of the soldiers of the Tsar's\r\nAsiatic corps. The commander of the Indian force, determined that his\r\nmen should strike their blow and sustain their reputation, advanced with\r\ngreat caution from Petworth, and late in the afternoon of the second\r\nevening after the bombardment of London, two Sikhs scouting in front of\r\nthe advance guard sighted a Russian bivouac on the road on the other\r\nside of the Wye Canal beyond Loxwood Bridge, which latter had been\r\ndemolished. The Indians were thereupon halted on the road which runs\r\nthrough the wood near Plaistow, and the officers held council. Their\r\ninformation was unfortunately very meagre and their knowledge of the\r\ncountry necessarily vague; but the Subadar Banerji Singh, who was of\r\nunusually fair complexion, volunteered to don a Russian uniform, which\r\nhad been taken with other property from a dead officer found upon the\r\nroad, and endeavour in that disguise to penetrate the enemy's lines.\r\n\r\nTowards dusk he set out on his perilous journey, and, on arriving at the\r\nwrecked bridge, shouted over to two Russian sentries, explaining that he\r\nhad been wounded and left behind after the fight at Haslemere, and\r\nrequesting their assistance to enable him to cross. Believing him to be\r\none of their infantry officers, they told him there were no means of\r\ncrossing unless he could swim, as their engineers had sounded the canal\r\nbefore blowing up the bridge, and had found it twenty feet deep.\r\n\r\nBanerji Singh questioned them artfully as to the position of their\r\ncolumn, which they said intended, in co-operation with a great force of\r\nFrench cavalry and infantry, to again attack Guildford at dawn; and\r\nfurther, they told him in confidence that the rearguard to which they\r\nbelonged only numbered about two thousand men, who had halted for the\r\nnight with the transport waggons on the Guildford road, about two miles\r\nnorth of Alfold.\r\n\r\nThen, after further confidences, they suggested that he should continue\r\nalong the canal bank for about a mile and a half, where there was a\r\nbridge still intact, and near which he would find the rearguard.\r\n\r\nThanking them, he withdrew into the falling gloom, and a quarter of an\r\nhour later entered the presence of his commanding officer, who, of\r\ncourse, was delighted with the information thus elicited. The Subadar\r\nhad carefully noted all the features of the canal bank and broken\r\nbridge, and the valuable knowledge he had obtained was at once put to\r\naccount, and the General at once formed his force into two divisions.\r\nThen, after issuing instructions for the following day, he gave orders\r\nfor a bivouac for the night.\r\n\r\nThe pioneers, however, were far from idle. During the night they worked\r\nwith unflagging energy, quietly preparing a position for the guns to\r\ncover the contemplated passage at Loxwood Bridge, and before day broke\r\nthe guns were mounted, and the Engineers were ready for action. As soon\r\nas there was sufficient light the laying of the pontoon commenced, but\r\nwas at once noticed by the Russians, who opened fire, and very soon it\r\nwas evident that information had been conveyed to the enemy's rearguard,\r\nand that they were returning to contest the passage.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime one division of the Indians, setting out before\r\ndaybreak, had been cautiously working round to the main road crossing\r\nthe canal north of Alfold, and succeeded in getting over soon after the\r\nmajority of the Russian rearguard had left for the assistance of the\r\ndetachment at Loxwood Bridge, and, after a sharp, decisive fight,\r\nsucceeded in capturing the whole of the transport waggons. The\r\nEngineers, with the Indians, had in the meantime succeeded in completing\r\ntheir pontoon under cover of the guns, and the second division of the\r\nIndians, dark-faced, daring fellows, rushed across to the opposite bank,\r\nand descended upon the enemy with frightful effect. In the hot\r\nengagement that followed, the Russians, now attacked in both front and\r\nrear, were totally annihilated, and thus the whole of the reserve\r\nammunition of the force assaulting Guildford fell into our hands.\r\n\r\nThis victory on the enemy's left flank caused the tide of events to turn\r\nin our favour, for the huge Russian and French columns that intended to\r\nagain carry the hills from Dorking to Guildford were hampered by want\r\nof ammunition, and so vigorously did our Volunteers along the hills\r\ndefend the repeated attacks, that the invaders were again driven back.\r\nThen, as they drew south to recover themselves, they were attacked on\r\ntheir left by a large body of our Regulars, and in the rear by the\r\nIndians and Australians. Over the country stretching across from Cranley\r\nthrough Ewhurst, Ockley, Capel, and Newdigate to Horley, the fighting\r\nspread, as each side struggled desperately for the mastery.\r\n\r\nThe fate of England, nay, of our vast British Empire, was in the hands\r\nof those of her stalwart sons of many races who were now wielding\r\nvaliantly the rifle and the sword. Through that blazing September day,\r\nwhile the people of London wailed among the ruins of their homes, and,\r\nbreathlessly anxious, awaited news of their victory or their doom, the\r\nwhole of East Kent, the southern portion of Surrey and northern Sussex,\r\nbecame one huge battlefield. Of the vast bodies of troops massed over\r\nhill and dale every regiment became engaged.\r\n\r\nThe butchery was awful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nNAVAL BATTLE OFF DUNGENESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn sea England was now showing the world how she still could fight.\r\nFollowing the desperate struggle off Sardinia, in which Italy had\r\nrendered us such valuable help, our Mediterranean Squadron attacked the\r\nFrench Fleet off Cape Tresforcas, on the coast of Morocco, and after a\r\nterrific battle, extending over two days, defeated them with heavy loss,\r\nseveral of the enemy's vessels being torpedoed and sunk, two of them\r\nrammed, and one so badly damaged that her captain ran her ashore on\r\nAlboran Island.\r\n\r\nAfter this hard-earned victory, our Squadron passed out of the\r\nMediterranean, and, returning home, had joined hands with the battered\r\nremnant of our Channel Fleet, now reinforced by several vessels recalled\r\nfrom foreign stations. Therefore, while the enemy marched upon London,\r\nwe had collected our naval strength on the south coast, and at length\r\nmade a final descent upon the enemy in British waters. The British\r\nvessels that passed Beachy Head coming up Channel on the night of the\r\nbombardment of London included the _Empress of India_, _Inflexible_,\r\n_Nile_, _Trafalgar_, _Magnificent_, _Hood_, _Warspite_, _Dreadnought_,\r\n_Camperdown_, _Blenheim_, _Barham_, _Benbow_, _Monarch_, _Anson_,\r\n_Immortalite_, and _Royal Sovereign_, with four of the new cruisers\r\nbuilt under the Spencer programme, viz. the _Terrible_, _Powerful_,\r\n_Doris_, and _Isis_, and a number of smaller vessels, torpedo boats, and\r\n\"destroyers.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same hour that our vessels were passing Beachy Head, the\r\nCoastguard at Sandwich Battery were suddenly alarmed by electric signals\r\nbeing flashed from a number of warships that were slowly passing the\r\nGull Stream revolving light towards the Downs. The sensation these\r\nlights caused among the Coastguard and Artillery was immediately\r\ndispelled when it was discovered that the warships were not hostile, but\r\nfriendly; that the Kaiser had sent a German Squadron, in two divisions,\r\nto assist us, and that these vessels were on their way to unite with our\r\nown Fleet. The first division, it was ascertained, consisted of the\r\n_Baden_, flying the flag of Vice-Admiral Koester; the _Sachen_,\r\ncommanded by Prince Henry of Prussia; the _Wuertemberg_, and the\r\n_Bayern_--all of 7400 tons, and each carrying 18 guns and nearly 400\r\nmen; while the despatch boat _Pfeil_, the new dynamite cruiser _Trier_,\r\nand a number of torpedo boats, accompanied them. The second division,\r\nunder Rear-Admiral von Diederichs on board the _Koenig Wilhelm_,\r\nconsisted of the _Brandenburg_, _Kuerfurst Friedrich Wilhelm_, and\r\n_Woerth_, each of 10,300 tons, and carrying 32 guns; the _Deutschland_\r\nand the _Friedrich der Grosse_, with the despatch vessel _Wacht_, and\r\nseveral torpedo gunboats and other craft.\r\n\r\nBefore dawn, the British and German Fleets united near South Sand Head\r\nlight, off the South Foreland, and it was decided to commence the attack\r\nwithout delay. Turning west again, the British ships, accompanied by\r\nthose of the Emperor William, proceeded slowly down Channel in search of\r\nthe enemy, which they were informed by signal had been sighted by the\r\nCoastguard at East Wear, near Folkestone, earlier in the night. Just as\r\nday broke, however, when the defenders were opposite Dymchurch, about\r\neight miles from land, the enemy were discovered in force. Apparently\r\nthe French and Russian Fleets had combined, and were preparing for a\r\nfinal descent upon Dover, or an assault upon the Thames defences; and it\r\ncould be seen that, with both forces so strong, the fight would\r\ninevitably be one to the death.\r\n\r\nLittle time was occupied in preliminaries. Soon our ships were within\r\nrange in fighting formation in single column in line abreast, while the\r\nFrench, under Admiral le Bourgeois, advanced in single column in line\r\nahead. The French flagship, leading, was within 2000 yards of the\r\nBritish line, and had not disclosed the nature of her attack. The\r\nenemy's Admiral had signalled to the ships astern of him to follow his\r\nmotions together, as nearly as possible to concentrate their guns at\r\npoint blank, right ahead, and to pour their shot on the instant of\r\npassing our ships. He had but three minutes to decide upon the attack,\r\nand as he apparently elected to pierce the centre of our line, the\r\nBritish had no time to counteract him. The French Admiral therefore\r\ncontinued his course, and as he passed between the _Camperdown_ and\r\n_Blenheim_, he discharged his guns, receiving the British broadsides and\r\nbow fire at the same time. In a few minutes, however, it was seen that\r\nthe French attack had been frustrated, and as dawn spread the fighting\r\nincreased, and the lines became broken. The ponderous guns of the\r\nbattleships thundered, and ere long the whole of the great naval force\r\nwas engaged in this final struggle for England's freedom. The three\r\npowerful French battleships, _Jaureguiberry_, _Jemappes_, and\r\n_Devastation_, and the submarine torpedo boat _Gustave Zede_, fiercely\r\nattacked the _Brandenburg_ and the _Koenig Wilhelm_; while the\r\n_Camperdown_, _Anson_, _Dreadnought_, and _Warspite_ fought desperately\r\nwith half a dozen of the enemy's battleships, all of which suffered\r\nconsiderably. Our torpedo boats, darting swiftly hither and thither,\r\nperformed much effective service, and many smart manoeuvres were carried\r\nout by astute officers in command of those wasps of the sea. In one\r\ninstance a torpedo boat, which had designs upon a Russian ironclad,\r\nobtained cover by sending in front of her a gunboat which emitted an\r\nimmense quantity of dense smoke. This of course obscured from view the\r\ntorpedo boat under the gunboat's stern, and those on board the Tsar's\r\nbattleship pounded away at the gunboat, unconscious of the presence of\r\nthe dangerous little craft. Just as the gunboat got level with the\r\nbattleship, however, the torpedo boat emerged from the cloud of smoke,\r\nand, darting along, ejected its Whitehead with such precision that five\r\nminutes later the Russian leviathan sank beneath the dark green waters.\r\nAlmost at the same moment, the new German dynamite cruiser destroyed a\r\nFrench cruiser, and a fierce and sanguinary encounter took place between\r\nthe _Immortalite_ and the _Trehouart_. The former's pair of 22-tonners,\r\nin combination with her ten 6-inch guns, wrought awful havoc on board\r\nthe French vessel; nevertheless, from the turret of her opponent there\r\ncame a deadly fire which spread death and destruction through the ship.\r\nSuddenly the Frenchman swung round, and with her quick-firing guns\r\nshedding a deadly storm of projectiles, came full upon the British\r\nvessel. The impact and the angle at which she was struck was not,\r\nhowever, sufficient to ram her, consequently the two vessels became\r\nentangled, and amid the rain of bullets the Frenchmen made a desperate\r\nattempt to board our ship. A few who managed to spring upon the\r\n_Immortalite's_ deck were cut down instantly, but a couple of hundred\r\nfully armed men were preparing to make a rush to overpower our\r\nbluejackets. On board the British cruiser, however, the enemy's\r\nintentions had been divined, and certain precautions taken. The\r\n_Fusiliers Marins_, armed with Lebels and cutlasses, suddenly made a\r\ndesperate, headlong rush upon the British cruiser's deck, but just as\r\nfifty of them gained their goal, a great hose attached to one of the\r\nboilers was brought into play, and scalding water poured upon the enemy.\r\nThis, in addition to some hand charges at that moment thrown, proved\r\nsuccessful in repelling the attack; but just as the survivors retreated\r\nin disorder there was a dull explosion, and then it was evident, from\r\nthe confusion on board the French ship, that she had been torpedoed by a\r\nGerman boat, and was sinking.\r\n\r\nHumanely, our vessel, the _Immortalite_ rescued the whole of her\r\nopponent's men ere she sank; but it was found that in the engagement her\r\ncaptain and half her crew had been killed. On every hand the fight\r\ncontinued with unabated fierceness; every gun was worked to its utmost\r\ncapacity, and amid the smoke and din every vessel was swept from stem\r\nto stern. As morning wore on, the enemy met with one or two successes.\r\nOur two new cruisers _Terrible_ and _Powerful_ had been sunk by French\r\ntorpedoes; the _Hood_ had been rammed by the _Amiral Baudin_, and gone\r\nto the bottom with nearly every soul on board; while the German despatch\r\nboat _Wacht_ had been captured, and seven of our torpedo boats had been\r\ndestroyed. During the progress of the fight, the vessels came gradually\r\nnearer Dungeness, and at eleven o'clock they were still firing at each\r\nother, with appalling results on either side. At such close quarters did\r\nthis great battle occur, that the loss of life was awful, and throughout\r\nthe ships the destruction was widespread and frightful. About noon the\r\nenemy experienced two reverses. The French battleship _Formidable_ blew\r\nup with a terrific report, filling the air with debris, her magazine\r\nhaving exploded; while just at that moment the _Courbet_, whose\r\n48-tonners had caused serious damage to the _Warspite_, was suddenly\r\nrammed and sunk by the _Empress of India_.\r\n\r\nThis, the decisive battle, was the most vigorously contested naval fight\r\nduring the whole of the hostilities. The scene was terrible. The steel\r\nleviathans of the sea were being rent asunder and pulverised by the\r\nterribly destructive modern arms, and amid the roar and crashing of the\r\nguns, shells were bursting everywhere, carrying away funnels, fighting\r\ntops, and superstructures, and wrecking the crowded spaces between the\r\ndecks. Turrets and barbettes were torn away, guns dismounted by the\r\nenormous shells from heavy guns; steel armour was torn up and thrown\r\naside like paper, and many shots entering broadsides, passed clean\r\nthrough and out at the other side. Whitehead torpedoes, carrying heavy\r\ncharges of gun-cotton, exploded now and then under the enemy's ships;\r\nwhile both British and French torpedo boat \"destroyers,\" running at the\r\nspeed of an ordinary train, were sinking or capturing where they could.\r\n\r\nThrough the dull, gloomy afternoon the battle continued. Time after time\r\nour ships met with serious reverses, for the _Anson_ was sunk by the\r\nRussian flagship _Alexander II._, assisted by two French cruisers, and\r\nthis catastrophe was followed almost immediately by the torpedoing of\r\nthe new British cruiser _Doris_, and the capture of the new German\r\ndynamite cruiser _Trier_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_H.M.S. Royal Sovereign._ _H.M.S. Camperdown._ _Amiral Baudin._\r\n_Russian flagship blown up._\r\n_H.M.S. Warspite._ _Cecille._\r\nFINAL BATTLE OFF DUNGENESS: \"THE SCENE OF DESTRUCTION WAS APPALLING.\"]\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, the vessels had approached within three miles of\r\nDungeness, and the _Camperdown_, _Empress of India_, _Royal Sovereign_,\r\n_Inflexible_, and _Warspite_, lying near one another, fought nine of the\r\nenemy's vessels, inflicting upon them terrible punishment. Shots from\r\nthe 67-tonners of the _Empress of India_, _Royal Sovereign_, and\r\n_Camperdown_, combined with those from the 22-tonners of the _Warspite_,\r\nswept the enemy's vessels with devastating effect, and during the\r\nthree-quarters of an hour that the fight between these vessels lasted,\r\nthe scene of destruction was appalling. Suddenly, with a brilliant flash\r\nand deafening detonation, the Russian flagship _Alexander II._, one of\r\nthe vessels now engaging the five British ships, blew up and sank, and\r\nere the enemy could recover from the surprise this disaster caused them,\r\nthe _Camperdown_ rammed the _Amiral Baudin_, while the _Warspite_ sank\r\nthe French cruiser _Cecille_, the submarine boat _Gustave Zede_, and\r\nafterwards captured the torpedo gunboat _Bombe_.\r\n\r\nThis rapid series of terrible disasters apparently demoralised the\r\nenemy. They fought recklessly, and amid the din and confusion two\r\nRussian vessels collided, and were so seriously damaged that both\r\nsettled down, their crews being rescued by British torpedo boats.\r\nImmediately afterwards, however, a frightful explosion rent the air with\r\na deafening sound that dwarfed into insignificance the roar of the heavy\r\nguns, and the French battleship _Jaureguiberry_ was completely broken\r\ninto fragments, scarcely any of her hull remaining. The enemy were\r\namazed. A few moments later another explosion occurred, even louder than\r\nthe first. For a second the French battleship _Devastation_, which had\r\nbeen engaging the _Royal Sovereign_, was obscured by a brilliant flash,\r\nthen, as fragments of steel and human limbs were precipitated on every\r\nside, it was seen that that vessel also had been completely blown out of\r\nthe water!\r\n\r\nThe enemy stood appalled. The defenders themselves were at first\r\ndumfounded. A few moments later, however, it became known throughout the\r\nBritish ships that the battery at Dungeness, two miles and a half\r\ndistant, were rendering assistance with the new pneumatic gun, the\r\nsecret of which the Government had guarded so long and so well. Five\r\nyears before, this frightfully deadly weapon had been tested, and proved\r\nso successful that the one gun made was broken up and the plans\r\npreserved with the utmost secrecy in a safe at the War Office. Now,\r\nhowever, several of the weapons had been constructed, and one of them\r\nhad been placed in the battery at Dungeness. The British vessels drew\r\noff to watch the awful effect of the fire from these marvellous and\r\nterribly destructive engines of modern warfare. The enemy would not\r\nsurrender, so time after time the deafening explosions sounded, and time\r\nafter time the hostile ships were shattered into fragments.\r\n\r\nEach shot fired by this new pneumatic gun contained 900 lbs. of\r\ndynamite, which could strike effectively at four miles! The result of\r\nsuch a charge exploding on a ship was appalling; the force was terrific,\r\nand could not be withstood by the strongest vessel ever constructed.\r\nIndeed, the great armoured vessels were being pulverised as easily as\r\nglass balls struck by bullets, and every moment hundreds of poor fellows\r\nwere being hurled into eternity. At last the enemy discovered the\r\ndistant source of the fire, and prepared to escape beyond range; but in\r\nthis they were unsuccessful, for, after a renewed and terrific fight, in\r\nwhich three French ironclads were sunk and two of our cruisers were\r\ntorpedoed, our force and our allies the Germans succeeded in capturing\r\nthe remainder of the hostile ships and torpedo boats.\r\n\r\nThe struggle had been frightful, but the victory was magnificent.\r\n\r\nThat same night the British ships steamed along the Sussex coast and\r\ncaptured the whole of the French and Russian transports, the majority of\r\nwhich were British vessels that had been seized while lying in French\r\nand Russian ports at the time war was declared. The vessels were lying\r\nbetween Beachy Head and Selsey Bill, and by their capture the enemy's\r\nmeans of retreat were at once totally cut off.\r\n\r\nThus, at the eleventh hour, the British Navy had shown itself worthy of\r\nits reputation, and England regained the supremacy of the seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE DAY OF RECKONING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Day of Reckoning dawned.\r\n\r\nOn land the battle was terrific; the struggle was the most fierce and\r\nbloody of any during the invasion. The British Regulars holding the high\r\nground along from Crowborough to Ticehurst, and from Etchingham, through\r\nBrightling and Ashburnham, down to Battle, advanced in a huge fighting\r\nline upon the enemy's base around Eastbourne. The onslaught was\r\nvigorously repelled, and the battle across the Sussex Downs quickly\r\nbecame a most wild and sanguinary one; but as the day passed, although\r\nthe defenders were numerically very weak, they nevertheless gradually\r\neffected terrible slaughter, capturing the whole of the enemy's stores,\r\nand taking nearly five thousand prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn Kent the French had advanced from East Grinstead through Edenbridge,\r\nextending along the hills south of Westerham, and in consequence of\r\nthese rapid successes the depot of stores and ammunition which had been\r\nmaintained at Sevenoaks was being removed to Bromley by rail; but as the\r\nofficer commanding the British troops at Eynsford could see that it\r\nwould most probably be impossible to get them all away before Sevenoaks\r\nwas attacked, orders were issued that at a certain hour the remainder\r\nshould be destroyed. The force covering the removal only consisted of\r\ntwo battalions of the Duke of Cambridge's Own (Middlesex) Regiment and\r\nhalf a squadron of the 9th Lancers; but the hills north of Sevenoaks\r\nfrom Luddesdown through Stanstead, Otford, Shoreham, Halstead,\r\nFarnborough, and Keston were still held by our Volunteers. These\r\ninfantry battalions included the 1st and 2nd Derbyshire Regiment\r\n(Sherwood Foresters), under Col. A. Buchanan, V.D., and Col. E. Hall,\r\nV.D.; the 1st Nottinghamshire, under Col. A. Cantrell-Hubbersty; the 4th\r\nDerbyshire, under Lord Newark; the 1st and 2nd Lincolnshire, under Col.\r\nJ. G. Williams, V.D., and Col. R. G. Ellison; the 1st Leicestershire,\r\nunder Col. S. Davis, V.D.; the 1st Northamptonshire, under Col. T. J.\r\nWalker, V.D.; the 1st and 2nd Shropshire Light Infantry, under Col. J.\r\nA. Anstice, V.D., and Col. R. T. Masefield; the 1st Herefordshire, under\r\nCol. T. H. Purser, V.D.; the 1st, 3rd, and 4th South Wales Borderers,\r\nunder Col. T. Wood, Col. J. A. Bradney, and Col. H. Burton, V.D.; the\r\n1st and 2nd Warwickshire, under Col. W. S. Jervis and Col. L. V. Loyd;\r\nthe 1st and 2nd Welsh Fusiliers, under Col. C. S. Mainwaring and Col. B.\r\nG. D. Cooke, V.D.; the 2nd Welsh Regiment, under Col. A. P. Vivian,\r\nV.D.; the 3rd Glamorganshire, under Col. J. C. Richardson, V.D.; and the\r\n1st Worcestershire, under Col. W. H. Talbot, V.D.; while the artillery\r\nconsisted of the 3rd Kent, under Col. Hozier; the 1st Monmouthshire,\r\nunder Col. C. T. Wallis; the 1st Shropshire and Staffordshire, under\r\nCol. J. Strick, V.D.; and the 5th Lancashire, under Col. W. H. Hunt.\r\n\r\nThe events which occurred outside Sevenoaks are perhaps best described\r\nby Capt. A. E. Brown, of the 4th V.B. West Surrey Regiment, who was\r\nacting as one of the special correspondents of the _Standard_. He\r\nwrote--\r\n\r\n\"I was in command of a piquet consisting of fifty men of my regiment at\r\nTurvan's Farm, and about three hours before the time to destroy the\r\nremainder of the stores at Sevenoaks my sentries were suddenly driven in\r\nby the enemy, who were advancing from the direction of Froghall. As I\r\nhad orders to hold the farm at any cost, we immediately prepared for\r\naction. Fortunately we had a fair supply of provisions and plenty of\r\nammunition, for since War had broken out the place had been utilised as\r\na kind of outlying fort, although at this time only my force occupied\r\nit. Our equipment included two machine guns, and it was mainly by the\r\naid of these we were saved.\r\n\r\n\"The strength of the attacking force appeared to be about four\r\nbattalions of French infantry and a battalion of Zouaves, with two\r\nsquadrons of Cuirassiers. Their intention was, no doubt, to cut the\r\nrailway line near Twitton, and thus prevent the removal of the Sevenoaks\r\nstores. As soon as the cavalry scouts came within range we gave them a\r\nfew sharp volleys, and those who were able immediately retired in\r\ndisorder. Soon afterwards, however, the farm was surrounded, but I had\r\npreviously sent information to our reserves, and suggested that a sharp\r\nwatch should be kept upon the line from Twitton to Sevenoaks, for of\r\ncourse I could do nothing with my small force. Dusk was now creeping on,\r\nand as the enemy remained quiet for a short time it seemed as though\r\nthey intended to assault our position when it grew dark.\r\n\r\n\"Before night set in, however, my messenger, who had managed to elude\r\nthe vigilance of the enemy, returned, with a letter from a brother\r\nofficer stating that a great naval battle had been fought in the\r\nChannel; and further, that the enemy's retreat had been cut off, and\r\nthat the Kentish defenders had already retaken the invaders' base at\r\nEastbourne. If we could, therefore, still hold the Surrey Hills, there\r\nwas yet a chance of thoroughly defeating the French and Russians, even\r\nthough one strong body was reported as having taken Guildford and\r\nLeatherhead, and was now marching upon London.\r\n\r\n\"As evening drew on we could hear heavy firing in the direction of\r\nSevenoaks, but as we also heard a train running it became evident that\r\nwe still held the station. Nevertheless, soon after dark there was a\r\nbrilliant flash which for a second lit up the country around like day,\r\nand a terrific report followed. We knew the remainder of our stores and\r\nammunition had been demolished in order that it should not fall into the\r\nenemy's hands!\r\n\r\n\"Shortly afterwards we were vigorously attacked, and our position\r\nquickly became almost untenable by the dozens of bullets projected in\r\nevery direction where the flash of our rifles could be seen. Very soon\r\nsome of the farm outbuildings fell into the hands of the Frenchmen, and\r\nthey set them on fire, together with a number of haystacks, in order to\r\nburn us out. This move, however, proved pretty disastrous to them, for\r\nthe leaping flames quickly rendered it light as day, and showed them up,\r\nwhile at the same time flashes from our muzzles were almost invisible to\r\nthem. Thus we were enabled to bring our two machine guns into action,\r\nand break up every party of Frenchmen who showed themselves. Away over\r\nSevenoaks there was a glare in the sky, for the enemy were looting and\r\nburning the town. Meanwhile, however, our men who had been defending the\r\nplace had retreated to Dunton Green after blowing up the stores, and\r\nthere they re-formed and were quickly moving off in the direction of\r\nTwitton. Fortunately they had heard the commencement of the attack on\r\nus, and the commander, halting his force, had sent out scouts towards\r\nChevening, and it appeared they reached us just at the moment the enemy\r\nhad fired the stacks. They worked splendidly, and, after going nearly\r\nall round the enemy's position, returned and reported to their Colonel,\r\nwho at once resolved to relieve us.\r\n\r\n\"As may be imagined, we were in a most critical position by this time,\r\nespecially as we were unaware that assistance was so near. We had been\r\nordered to hold the farm, and we meant to do it as long as breath\r\nremained in our bodies. All my men worked magnificently, and displayed\r\nremarkable coolness, even at the moment when death stared us in the\r\nface. The reports of the scouts enabled their Colonel to make his\r\ndisposition very carefully, and it was not long before the enemy were\r\nalmost completely surrounded. We afterwards learnt that our reserves at\r\nStockholm Wood had sent out a battalion, which fortunately came in touch\r\nwith the survivors of the Sevenoaks force just as they opened a\r\ndesperate onslaught upon the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"With the fierce flames and blinding smoke from the burning stacks\r\nbelching in our faces, we fought on with fire around us on every side.\r\nAs the fire drew nearer to us the heat became intense, the showers of\r\nsparks galled us almost as much as the enemy's bullets, and some of us\r\nhad our eyebrows and hair singed by the fierce flames. Indeed, it was as\r\nmuch as we could do to keep our ammunition from exploding; nevertheless\r\nwe kept up our stream of lead, pouring volley after volley upon those\r\nwho had attacked us. Nevertheless, with such a barrier of flame and\r\nobscuring smoke between us we could see but little in the darkness\r\nbeyond, and we all knew that if we emerged from cover we should be\r\npicked off easily and not a man would survive. The odds were against us.\r\nMore than twenty of my brave fellows had fired their last shot, and now\r\nlay with their dead upturned faces looking ghastly in the brilliant\r\nglare, while a number of others had sunk back wounded. The heat was\r\nfrightful, the smoke stifling, and I had just given up all hope of\r\nrelief, and had set my teeth, determined to die like an Englishman\r\nshould, when we heard a terrific volley of musketry at close quarters,\r\nand immediately afterwards a dozen British bugles sounded the charge.\r\nThe scene of carnage that followed was terrible. Our comrades gave one\r\nvolley from their magazines rifles, and then charged with the bayonet,\r\ntaking the enemy completely by surprise.\r\n\r\n\"The Frenchmen tried to rally, but in vain, and among those huge burning\r\nbarns and blazing ricks they all fell or were captured. Dozens of them\r\nstruggled valiantly till the last; but, refusing to surrender, they were\r\nslaughtered amid a most frightful scene of blood and fire. The events of\r\nthat night were horrible, and the true extent of the losses on both\r\nsides was only revealed when the flames died down and the parting clouds\r\nabove heralded another grey and toilsome day.\"\r\n\r\nLate on the previous evening the advance guard of the enemy proceeding\r\nnorth towards Caterham came in touch with the defenders north of\r\nGodstone. The French cavalry had seized Red Hill Junction Station at\r\nsundown, and some of their scouts suddenly came upon a detached post of\r\nthe 17th Middlesex Volunteers at Tyler's Green, close to Godstone. A\r\nvery sharp skirmish ensued, but the Volunteers, although suffering\r\nsevere losses, held their own, and the cavalry went off along the Oxted\r\nRoad. This being reported to the British General, special orders were at\r\nonce sent to Col. Trotter, the commander of this section of the outpost\r\nline.\r\n\r\nFrom the reports of the inhabitants and of scouts sent out in plain\r\nclothes, it was believed that the French intended massing near\r\nTandridge, and that they would therefore wait for supports before\r\nattempting to break through our outpost line, which still remained\r\nintact from the high ground east of Leatherhead to the hills north of\r\nSevenoaks. During the night Oxted and Godstone were occupied by the\r\nenemy, and early in the morning their advance guard, consisting of four\r\nbattalions of infantry, a squadron of cavalry, a battalion of Zouaves,\r\nand a section of field artillery, proceeded north in two columns, one\r\nalong the Roman road leading past Rook's Nest, and the other past\r\nFlinthall Farm.\r\n\r\nAt the latter place the sentries of the 17th Middlesex fell back upon\r\ntheir piquets, and both columns of the enemy came into action\r\nsimultaneously. The French infantry on the high road soon succeeded in\r\ndriving back the Volunteer piquet upon the supports, under Lieut.\r\nMichaelis, stationed at the junction of the Roman road with that leading\r\nto Godstone Quarry. A strong barricade with two deep trenches in front\r\nhad here been constructed, and as soon as the survivors of the piquet\r\ngot under cover, two of the defenders' machine guns opened fire from\r\nbehind the barricade, assisted at the same moment by a battery on\r\nGravelly Hill.\r\n\r\nThe French artillery had gone on towards Flinthall Farm, but in passing\r\nthe north edge of Rook's Nest Park their horses were shot by some\r\nInniskilling Fusiliers lying in ambush, and by these two reverses,\r\ncombined with the deadly fire from the two machine guns at the farm, the\r\ncolumn was very quickly thrown into confusion. It was then decided to\r\nmake a counter attack, and the available companies at this section of\r\nthe outpost line, under Col. Brown and Col. Roche, succeeded, after\r\nnearly two hours' hard fighting, in retaking Godstone and Oxted,\r\ncompelling the few survivors of the enemy's advance guard to fall back\r\nto Blindley Heath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATTLE OF CATERHAM: PLAN OF THE BRITISH POSITIONS.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime our troops occupying the line from Halstead to Chatham\r\nand Maidstone went down into battle, attacking the French right wing at\r\nthe same time as the Indians were attacking their left, while the\r\nVolunteers from the Surrey Hills engaged the main body. The day was\r\nblazing hot, the roads dusty, and there was scarce a breath of wind. So\r\nhot, indeed, was it, that many on both sides fell from hunger, thirst,\r\nand sheer starvation. Yet, although the force of the invaders was nearly\r\ntwice the numerical strength of the defenders, the latter fought on with\r\nundaunted courage, striking their swift, decisive blows for England and\r\ntheir Queen.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, now driven into a triangle, fought with demoniacal strength,\r\nand that frenzied courage begotten of despair. On the hills around\r\nSevenoaks and across to the valley at Otford, the slaughter of the\r\nFrench was fearful. Britons fighting for their homes and their country\r\nwere determined that Britannia should still be Ruler of the World.\r\n\r\nFrom Wimlet Hill the enemy were by noon totally cut up and routed by the\r\n12th Middlesex (Civil Service), under Lord Bury; the 25th (Bank), under\r\nCapt. W. J. Coe, V.D.; the 13th (Queen's), under Col. J. W. Comerford;\r\nthe 21st Middlesex, under Col. H. B. Deane, V.D.; and the 22nd, under\r\nCol. W. J. Alt, V.D. Over at Oxted, however, they rallied, and some\r\nbrilliant charges by Cossacks, the slaughter of a portion of our advance\r\nguard, and the capture of one of our Volunteer batteries on Botley Hill,\r\nchecked our advance.\r\n\r\nThe French, finding their right flank being so terribly cut up, had\r\nsuddenly altered their tactics, and were now concentrating their forces\r\nupon the Volunteer position at Caterham in an endeavour to break through\r\nour defensive line.\r\n\r\nBut the hills about that position held by the North London, West London,\r\nSouth London, Surrey, and Cheshire Brigades were well defended, and the\r\nGeneral had his finger upon the pulse of his command. Most of the\r\npositions had been excellently chosen. Strong batteries were established\r\nat Gravelly Hill by the 9th Lancashire Volunteer Artillery, under Col.\r\nF. Ainsworth, V.D.; at Harestone Farm by the 1st Cinque Ports, under\r\nCol. P. S. Court, V.D.; at White Hill by the 1st Northumberland and the\r\n1st Norfolk, under Col. P. Watts and Col. T. Wilson, V.D.; at Botley\r\nHill by the 6th Lancashire, under Col. H. J. Robinson, V.D.; at\r\nTandridge Hill by the 3rd Lancashire, under Col. R. W. Thom, V.D.; at\r\nChaldon by the 1st Newcastle, under Col. W. M. Angus, V.D., who had come\r\nsouth after the victory at the Tyneside; at Warlingham village by the\r\n1st Cheshire, commanded by Col. H. T. Brown, V.D.; at Warlingham Court\r\nby the 2nd Durham, under Col. J. B. Eminson, V.D.; on the Sanderstead\r\nroad, near King's Wood, by the 2nd Cinque Ports, under Col. W. Taylor,\r\nV.D.; and on the railway near Woldingham the 1st Sussex had stationed\r\ntheir armoured train with 40-pounder breech-loading Armstrongs, which\r\nthey fired very effectively from the permanent way.\r\n\r\nThrough Limpsfield, Oxted, Godstone, Bletchingley, and Nutsfield,\r\ntowards Reigate, Frenchmen and Britons fought almost hand to hand. The\r\ndefenders suffered severely, owing to the repeated charges of the French\r\nDragoons along the highway between Oxted and Godstone, nevertheless the\r\nbatteries of the 6th Lancashire on Tandridge Hill, which commanded a\r\nwide area of country occupied by the enemy, wrought frightful execution\r\nin their ranks. In this they were assisted by the 17th Middlesex, under\r\nCol. W. J. Brown, V.D., who with four Maxims at one period of the fight\r\nsurprised and practically annihilated a whole battalion of French\r\ninfantry. But into this attack on Caterham the enemy put his whole\r\nstrength, and from noon until four o'clock the fighting along the valley\r\nwas a fierce combat to the death.\r\n\r\nWith every bit of cover bristling with magazine rifles, and every\r\navailable artillery position shedding forth a storm of bullets and\r\nshell, the loss of life was awful. Invaders and defenders fell in\r\nhundreds, and with burning brow and dry parched throat expired in agony.\r\nThe London Irish, under Col. J. Ward, V.D.; the Post Office Corps, under\r\nCol. J. Du Plat Taylor, V.D., and Col. S. R. Thompson, V.D.; the Inns of\r\nCourt, under Col. C. H. Russell, V.D.; and the Cyclists, led by Major T.\r\nDe B. Holmes, performed many gallant deeds, and served their country\r\nwell. The long, dusty highways were quickly covered with the bodies of\r\nthe unfortunate victims, who lay with blanched, bloodless faces and\r\nsightless eyes turned upward to the burning sun. On over them rode madly\r\nFrench cavalry and Cossacks, cutting their way into the British\r\ninfantry, never to return.\r\n\r\nJust, however, as they prepared for another terrific onslaught, the guns\r\nof the 1st Cheshire battery at Warlingham village thundered, and with\r\nsmart section volleys added by detachments of the London Scottish, under\r\nMajor W. Brodie, V.D., and the Artists, under Capt. W. L. Duffield and\r\nLieut. Pott, the road was in a few minutes strewn with horses and men\r\ndead and dying.\r\n\r\nStill onward there rushed along the valley great masses of French\r\ninfantry, but the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Volunteer Battalions of the Royal\r\nFusiliers, under Col. G. C. Clark, V.D., Col. A. L. Keller, and Col. L.\r\nWhewell respectively; the 2nd V. B. Middlesex Regiment, under Col. G.\r\nBrodie Clark, V.D.; the 3rd Middlesex, under Col. R Hennell, D.S.O.,\r\nlate of the Indian Army; and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th West Surrey,\r\nunder Col. J. Freeland, V.D., Col. G. Drewitt, V.D., Col. S. B.\r\nBevington, V.D., and Col. F. W. Haddan, V.D., engaged them, and by dint\r\nof desperate effort, losing heavily all the time, they defeated them,\r\ndrove them back, and slaughtered them in a manner that to a\r\nnon-combatant was horrible and appalling. Time after time, the enemy,\r\nstill being harassed by the British Regulars on their right, charged up\r\nthe valley, in order to take the battery at Harestone Farm; but on each\r\noccasion few of those who dashed forward survived. The dusty roads, the\r\ngrassy slopes, and the ploughed lands were covered with corpses, and\r\nblood draining into the springs and rivulets tinged their crystal\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nAs afternoon passed and the battle continued, it was by no means certain\r\nthat success in this fierce final struggle would lie with us. Having\r\nregard to the enormous body of invaders now concentrated on the Surrey\r\nborder, and striving by every device to force a passage through our\r\nlines, our forces, spread over such a wide area and outflanking them,\r\nwere necessarily weak. It was therefore only by the excellent tactics\r\ndisplayed by our officers, and the magnificent courage of the men\r\nthemselves, that we had been enabled to hold back these overwhelming\r\nmasses, which had already desolated Sussex with fire and sword.\r\n\r\nOur Regulars operating along the old Roman highway through Blindley\r\nHeath--where the invaders were making a desperate stand--and over to\r\nLingfield, succeeded, after very hard fighting, in clearing the enemy\r\noff the railway embankment from Crowhurst along to South Park Farm, and\r\nfollowing them up, annihilated them.\r\n\r\nGradually, just at sundown, a strong division of the enemy were\r\noutflanked at Godstone, and, refusing to lay down their arms, were\r\nsimply swept out of existence, scarcely a single man escaping. Thus\r\nforced back from, perhaps, the most vulnerable point in our defences,\r\nthe main body of the enemy were then driven away upon Redhill, still\r\nfighting fiercely. Over Redstone Hill, through Mead Vale, and across\r\nReigate Park to the Heath, the enemy were shot down in hundreds by our\r\nRegulars; while our Volunteers, whose courage never deserted them,\r\nengaged the French in hand-to-hand encounters through the streets of\r\nRedhill and Reigate, as far as Underhill Park.\r\n\r\nIn Hartswood a company of the 4th East Surrey Rifles, under Major S. B.\r\nWheaton, V.D., were lying in ambush, when suddenly among the trees they\r\ncaught glimpses of red, baggy trousers, and scarlet, black-tasselled\r\nfezes, and a few seconds later they found that a large force of Zouaves\r\nwere working through the wood. A few moments elapsed, and the combat\r\ncommenced. The Algerians fought like demons, and with bullet and bayonet\r\ninflicted terrible punishment upon us; but as they emerged into the road\r\npreparatory to firing a volley into the thickets, they were surprised by\r\na company of the 2nd Volunteer Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment,\r\nunder Capt. Pott, who killed and wounded half their number, and took the\r\nremainder prisoners.\r\n\r\nGradually our Volunteer brigades occupying the long range of hills\r\nunited with our Regulars still on the enemy's right from Reigate to\r\nCrawley, and closed down upon the foe, slowly narrowing the sphere of\r\ntheir operations, and by degrees forcing them back due westward.\r\nRussians and French, who had attacked Dorking, had by this time been\r\ndefeated with heavy loss, and by dusk the main body had been thrown back\r\nto Newdigate, where in Reffold's Copse one or two very sanguinary\r\nencounters occurred. These, however, were not always in our favour, for\r\nthe Civil Service Volunteers here sustained very heavy losses. On the\r\nrailway embankment, and on the road running along the crest of the hill\r\nto Dorking, the French made a stand, and there wrought frightful\r\nexecution among our men with their machine guns. Around Beare Green,\r\nTrout's Farm, and behind the \"White Hart\" at Holmwood, the enemy rapidly\r\nbrought their guns into play, and occupied such strong strategic\r\npositions that as night drew on it became evident that they intended to\r\nremain there until the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe defenders had but little cover, and consequently felt the withering\r\nfire of the French very severely. The latter had entrenched themselves,\r\nand now in the darkness it was difficult for our men to discern their\r\nexact position. Indeed, the situation of our forces became very serious\r\nand unsafe as night proceeded; but at length, about ten o'clock, a\r\nstrong force of British Regulars, including the Sikhs and a detachment\r\nof Australians, swept along the road from Dorking, and came suddenly\r\nupon the French patrols. These were slaughtered with little resistance,\r\nand almost before the enemy were aware of it, the whole position was\r\ncompletely surrounded.\r\n\r\nOur men then used their field search-lights with very great advantage;\r\nfor, as the enemy were driven out into the open, they were blinded by\r\nthe glare, and fell an easy prey to British rifles; while the\r\nFrenchmen's own machine guns were turned upon them with frightful\r\neffect, their battalions being literally mowed down by the awful hail of\r\nbullets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n\"FOR ENGLAND!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the whole night the battle still raged furiously. The enemy\r\nfought on with reckless, unparalleled daring. Chasseurs and Zouaves,\r\nCuirassiers, Dragoons, and infantry from the Loire and the Rhone\r\nstruggled desperately, contesting every step, and confident of ultimate\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nBut the enemy had at last, by the splendid tactics of the defenders,\r\nbeen forced into a gradually contracting square, bounded by Dorking and\r\nGuildford in the north, and Horsham and Billinghurst in the south, and\r\nsoon after midnight, with a concentric movement from each of the four\r\ncorners, British Regulars and Volunteers advanced steadily upon the foe,\r\nsurrounding and slaughtering them.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of that night were frightful; the loss of life on every hand\r\nenormous. Britannia had husbanded her full strength until this critical\r\nmoment; for now, when the fate of her Empire hung upon a single thread,\r\nshe sent forth her valiant sons, who fell upon those who had desecrated\r\nand destroyed their homes, and wreaked a terrible vengeance.\r\n\r\nThrough the dark, sultry hours this awful destruction of life continued\r\nwith unabated fury, and many a Briton closed with his foe in death\r\nembrace, or fell forward mortally wounded. Of British heroes there were\r\nmany that night, for true pluck showed itself everywhere, and Englishmen\r\nperformed many deeds worthy their traditions as the most courageous\r\nand undaunted among nations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH BLUEJACKETS MARCHING THROUGH THE STRAND AFTER THE\r\nVICTORY.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the French Commander-in-chief had been killed, yet the enemy\r\nstill fought on tenaciously, holding their ground on Leith Hill and\r\nthrough Pasture Wood to Wotton and Abinger, until at length, when the\r\nsaffron streak in the sky heralded another blazing day, the straggling,\r\nexhausted remnant of the once-powerful legions of France and Russia,\r\nperspiring, dust-covered, and bloodstained, finding they stood alone,\r\nand that the whole of Sussex and Surrey had been swept and their\r\ncomrades slaughtered, laid down their arms and eventually surrendered.\r\n\r\nAfter these three breathless days of butchery and bloodshed England was\r\nat last victorious!\r\n\r\nIn this final struggle for Britain's freedom the invader had been\r\ncrushed and his power broken; for, thanks to our gallant citizen\r\nsoldiers, the enemy that had for weeks overrun our smiling land like\r\npacks of hungry wolves, wantonly burning our homes and massacring the\r\ninnocent and unprotected, had at length met with their well-merited\r\ndeserts, and now lay spread over the miles of pastures, cornfields, and\r\nforests, stark, cold, and dead.\r\n\r\nBritain had at last vanquished the two powerful nations that had sought\r\nby ingenious conspiracy to accomplish her downfall.\r\n\r\nThousands of her brave sons had, alas! fallen while fighting under the\r\nBritish flag. Many of the principal streets of her gigantic capital were\r\nonly parallel lines of gaunt, blackened ruins, and many of her finest\r\ncities lay wrecked, shattered, and desolate; yet this terrible ordeal\r\nhad happily not weakened her power one iota, nor had she been ousted\r\nfrom her proud position as chief among the mighty Empires of the world.\r\n\r\nThree days after the great and decisive battle of Caterham, the British\r\ntroops, with their compatriots from the Cape, Australia, Canada, and\r\nIndia, entered London triumphantly, bringing with them some thousands of\r\nFrench and Russian prisoners. In the streets, as, ragged and dusty,\r\nBritain's defenders passed through on their way to a great Open-Air\r\nThanksgiving Service in Hyde Park, there were scenes of the wildest\r\nenthusiasm. With heartfelt gratitude, the people, scrambling over the\r\ndebris heaped each side of the streets, cheered themselves hoarse; the\r\nmen grasping the hands of Volunteers and veterans, and the women,\r\nweeping for joy, raising the soldiers' hands to their lips. The glad\r\ntidings of victory caused rejoicings everywhere. England, feeling\r\nherself free, breathed again. In every church and chapel through the\r\nUnited Kingdom special Services of Thanksgiving for deliverance from the\r\ninvaders' thrall were held, while in every town popular fetes were\r\norganised, and delighted Britons gaily celebrated their magnificent and\r\noverwhelming triumph.\r\n\r\nIn this disastrous struggle between nations France had suffered\r\nfrightfully. Paris, bombarded and burning, capitulated on the day\r\nfollowing the battle of Caterham, and the legions of the Kaiser marched\r\nup the Boulevards with their brilliant cavalry uniforms flashing in the\r\nsun. Over the Hotel de Ville, the Government buildings on the Quai\r\nd'Orsay, and the Ministries of War and Marine, the German flag was\r\nhoisted, and waved lazily in the autumn breeze, while the Emperor\r\nWilliam himself had an interview with the French President at the\r\nElysee.\r\n\r\nThat evening all France knew that Paris had fallen. In a few days\r\nEngland was already shipping back to Dieppe and Riga her prisoners of\r\nwar, and negotiations for peace had commenced. As security against any\r\nfurther attempts on England, Italian troops were occupying the whole of\r\nSouthern France from Grenoble to Bordeaux; and the Germans, in addition\r\nto occupying Paris, had established their headquarters in Moghilev, and\r\ndriven back the Army of the Tsar far beyond the Dnieper.\r\n\r\nFrom both France and Russia, Germany demanded huge indemnities, as well\r\nas a large tract of territory in Poland, and the whole of the vast\r\nChampagne country from Givet, on the Belgian frontier, down to the\r\nSaone.\r\n\r\nTen days later France was forced to accept the preliminaries of a treaty\r\nwhich we proposed. This included the cession to us of Algiers, with its\r\ndocks and harbour, so that we might establish another naval station in\r\nthe Mediterranean, and the payment of an indemnity of L250,000,000. Our\r\ndemands upon Russia at the same time were that she should withdraw all\r\nher troops from Bokhara, and should cede to us the whole of that portion\r\nof the Trans-Caspian territory lying between the mouths of the Oxus and\r\nKizil Arvat, thence along the Persian frontier to Zulfikai, along the\r\nAfghan frontier to Karki, and from there up the bank of the Oxus to the\r\nAral Sea. This vast area of land included the cities of Khiva and Merv,\r\nthe many towns around Kara Khum, the country of the Kara Turkomans, the\r\nTekeh and the Yomuts, and the annexation of it by Britain would\r\neffectually prevent the Russians ever advancing upon India.\r\n\r\nUpon these huge demands, in addition to the smaller ones by Italy and\r\nAustria, a Peace Conference was opened at Brussels without delay, and at\r\nlength France and her Muscovite ally, both vanquished and ruined, were\r\ncompelled to accept the proposals of Britain and Germany.\r\n\r\nHence, on November 16th, 1897, the Treaty of Peace was signed, and eight\r\ndays later was ratified. Then the huge forces of the Kaiser gradually\r\nwithdrew into Germany, and the soldiers of King Humbert recrossed the\r\nAlps, while we shipped back the remainder of our prisoners, reopened our\r\ntrade routes, and commenced rebuilding our shattered cities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nDAWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA raw, cold December morning in London. With the exception of a\r\nstatuesque sentry on the Horse Guards' Parade, the wide open space was\r\ndeserted. It had not long been light, and a heavy yellow mist still hung\r\nover the grass in St. James's Park.\r\n\r\nA bell clanged mournfully. Big Ben chimed the hour, and then boomed\r\nforth eight o'clock. An icy wind swept across the gravelled square. The\r\nbare, black branches of the stunted trees creaked and groaned, and the\r\nlonely sentry standing at ease before his box rubbed his hands and\r\nshivered.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a side door opened, and there emerged a small procession.\r\nSlowly there walked in front a clergyman bare-headed, reciting with\r\nsolemn intonation the Burial Service. Behind him, with unsteady step and\r\nbent shoulders, a trembling man with blanched, haggard face, and a wild\r\nlook of terror in his dark, deep-sunken eyes. He wore a shabby\r\nmorning-coat tightly buttoned, and his hands in bracelets of steel were\r\nbehind his back.\r\n\r\nGlancing furtively around at the grey dismal landscape, he shuddered.\r\nBeside and behind him soldiers tramped on in silence.\r\n\r\nThe officer's sword grated along the gravel.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a word of command caused them to halt against a wall, and a\r\nsergeant, stepping forward, took a handkerchief and tied it over the\r\neyes of the quivering culprit, who now stood with his back against the\r\nwall. Another word from the officer, and the party receded some\r\ndistance, leaving the man alone. The monotonous nasal utterances of the\r\nchaplain still sounded as four privates advanced, and, halting, stood in\r\nsingle rank before the prisoner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXECUTION OF VON BEILSTEIN ON THE HORSE GUARDS' PARADE.]\r\n\r\nThey raised their rifles. There was a momentary pause. In the distance a\r\ndog howled dismally.\r\n\r\nA sharp word of command broke the quiet.\r\n\r\nThen, a second later, as four rifles rang out simultaneously, the\r\ncondemned man tottered forward and fell heavily on the gravel, shot\r\nthrough the heart.\r\n\r\nIt was the spy and murderer, Karl von Beilstein!\r\n\r\nHe had been brought from Glasgow to London in order that certain\r\ninformation might be elicited from him, and after his actions had been\r\nthoroughly investigated by a military court, he had been sentenced to\r\ndeath. The whole of his past was revealed by his valet Grevel, and it\r\nwas proved that, in addition to bringing the great disaster upon\r\nEngland, he had also betrayed the country whose roubles purchased his\r\ncunningly-obtained secrets.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Engleheart, although gallantly assisting in the fight outside\r\nLeatherhead, and subsequently showing conspicuous bravery during the\r\nBattle of Caterham, fortunately escaped with nothing more severe than a\r\nbullet wound in the arm. During the searching private inquiry held at\r\nthe Foreign Office after peace was restored, he explained the whole of\r\nthe circumstances, and was severely reprimanded for his indiscretion;\r\nbut as no suspicion of von Beilstein's real motive had been aroused\r\nprior to the Declaration of War, and as it was proved that Geoffrey was\r\nentirely innocent of any complicity in the affair, he was, at the urgent\r\nrequest of Lord Stanbury, allowed to resume his duties. Shortly\r\nafterwards he was married to Violet Vayne, and Sir Joseph, having\r\nrecovered those of his ships that had been seized by the Russian\r\nGovernment, was thereby enabled to give his daughter a handsome dowry.\r\n\r\nThe young French clerk who had been engaged at the Admiralty, and who\r\nhad committed murder for gold, escaped to Spain, and, after being\r\nhunted by English and Spanish detectives for many weeks, he became\r\napparently overwhelmed by remorse. Not daring to show himself by day,\r\nnor to claim the money that had been promised him, he had tramped on\r\nthrough the snow from village to village in the unfrequented valleys of\r\nLerida, while his description was being circulated throughout the\r\nContinent. Cold, weary, and hungry, he one night entered the Posada de\r\nlas Pijorras at the little town of Oliana, at the foot of the Sierra del\r\nCadi. Calling for wine, he took up a dirty crumpled copy of the Madrid\r\n_Globo_, three days old. A paragraph, headed \"The Missing Spy,\" caught\r\nhis eyes, and, reading eagerly, he found to his dismay that the police\r\nwere aware that he had been in Huesca a week before, and were now using\r\nbloodhounds to track him!\r\n\r\nThe paper fell from his nerveless grasp. The wine at his elbow he\r\nswallowed at one gulp, and, tossing down his last real upon the table,\r\nhe rose and stumbled away blindly into the darkness.\r\n\r\nWhen the wintry dawn spread in that silent, distant valley, it showed a\r\ncorpse lying in the snow with face upturned. In the white wrinkled brow\r\nwas a small dark-blue hole from which blood had oozed over the pallid\r\ncheek, leaving an ugly stain. The staring eyes were wide open, with a\r\nlook of unutterable horror in them, and beside the thin clenched hand\r\nlay a revolver, one chamber of which had been discharged!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe dreary gloom of winter passed, and there dawned a new era of\r\nprosperity for England.\r\n\r\nDark days were succeeded by a period of happiness and rejoicing, and\r\nBritannia, grasping her trident again, seated herself on her shield\r\nbeside the sea, Ruler of the Waves, Queen of Nations, and Empress of the\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nMORRISON AND GIBB, PRINTERS, EDINBURGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ready shortly, price 6s._\r\nDemy 8vo, handsomely bound in cloth gilt.\r\n\r\nZORAIDA.\r\n_A ROMANCE OF THE HAREM AND THE DESERT._\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM LE QUEUX, F.R.G.S.,\r\nAUTHOR OF \"THE GREAT WAR IN 1897.\"\r\n_PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED BY H.

Regarded simply as a work of fiction, it\r\n    is exciting enough to satisfy the most enthusiastic lover of\r\n    'blood and thunder' literature.

The chapter dealing with the march of the French\r\n    on London is particularly fine. The author's production is the\r\n    best of the kind we have come across for some time.

Aerial navies engage armies\r\nand fleets and fortresses, and fight with each other in an unsparing\r\nwarfare, which has for its prize the empire of the world. Unlike all\r\nother essays in prophetic fiction, it deals with the events of\r\nto-morrow, and with characters familiar in the eyes of living men. It\r\nmarks an entirely new departure in fiction, and opens up possibilities\r\nwhich may become stupendous and appalling realities before the present\r\ngeneration of men has passed away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A FEW PRESS OPINIONS._\r\n\r\n    \"Since the days of the Arabian Nights' Entertainments, we know\r\n    of no writer who 'takes the cake' like Mr. George\r\n    Griffith.\"--_Daily Chronicle._\r\n\r\n    \"A really exciting and sensational romance.\"--_Literary World._\r\n\r\n    \"As a work of imagination it takes high rank.\"--_Belfast News\r\n    Letter._\r\n\r\n    \"Full of absorbing interest.\"--_Barrow Herald._\r\n\r\n    \"This powerful story.\"--_Liverpool Mercury._\r\n\r\n    \"An entirely new departure in fiction.\"--_Reynolds' Newspaper._\r\n\r\n    \"Of exceptional brilliancy and power.\"--_Western Figaro._\r\n\r\n    \"This remarkable story.\"--_Weekly Times and Echo._\r\n\r\n    \"There is a fascination about his book that few will be able to\r\n    resist.\"--_Birmingham Gazette._\r\n\r\n    \"This exciting romance.\"--_Licensing World._\r\n\r\n    \"A work of strong imaginative power.\"--_Dundee Courier._\r\n\r\n    \"We must congratulate the author upon the vividness and reality\r\n    with which he draws his unprecedented pictures.\"--_Bristol\r\n    Mercury._\r\n\r\n    \"Is quite enthralling.\"--_Glasgow Herald._\r\n\r\n    \"A striking and fascinating novel.\"--_Hampshire Telegraph._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDemy 8vo, handsomely bound in cloth, price 6s.\r\n_With Frontispiece by Edwin S.

These pictures have a weird splendour in\r\n    keeping with the theme, but it is natural to desire a better\r\n    future for the human race than the one here\r\n    prophesied.\"--_Morning Post._\r\n\r\n    \"His theme is a more tremendous one, and the incidents of his\r\n    story tenfold more terrible than even those awful battles in the\r\n    former volume. There is the same swift succession of awful\r\n    calamities, the same sustained interest from title page to\r\n    cover, and the same thread of human love running through the\r\n    narrative which lent its chief charm to the 'Angel of the\r\n    Revolution.'\"--_Weekly Times and Echo._\r\n\r\n    \"By lovers of sensational writing, in which the scientific\r\n    discoveries of the future are forecast, and intrigue and warfare\r\n    related in realistic manner under conditions which now exist but\r\n    in prophetic imagination, it will be warmly welcomed....
