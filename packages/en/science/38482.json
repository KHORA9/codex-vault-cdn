Millard, of Clayville, N. Y., has invented a scythe\r\nblade that contains much less weight of metal and possesses equal or\r\ngreater strength than the ordinary scythe blades. It is made in the\r\nusual manner from what is termed by scythe makers a \"scythe rod,\" and\r\nis wrought and shaped in such form that a proper thickness is left\r\nto serve as the back of the blade. A longitudinal auxiliary rib or\r\nsupplementary back is formed on the blade, which stiffens the scythe\r\nwithout requiring the same weight of metal as those of the usual\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nMr. George C. Winslow, of Kalamazoo, Mich., has patented an\r\nimprovement in spring harrow teeth, which consists generally in\r\nhinging the harrow tooth in the forward end of a rectangular frame\r\nbolted to the harrow bar, and combining therewith a spring, which\r\nat its back end is clamped to the harrow bar by the same bolts which\r\nsecure the rectangular frame, and which spring then curves upward and\r\nforward, and then down through the slot or opening of the rectangular\r\nframe, and is jointed at its extremity, near the bottom of the harrow\r\ntooth, so that its tension serves to throw the harrow tooth forward,\r\nbut allows it to yield to obstruction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RARE SPECIMEN LOST.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ingalls, of the schooner Chalcedony, has let slip an\r\nopportunity to make a small fortune and at the same time settle the\r\nlong vexed question as to the reality of the elusive and possibly\r\nmythical sea serpent. His story, as told in the _Argus_, of Portland,\r\nMaine, June 8, runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Last Saturday, about one o'clock in the afternoon, we were slowly\r\nsailing past Monhegan, there being very little wind, about twenty\r\nmiles southwest of the island, when we caught sight of what looked\r\nlike a large schooner floating bottom up. As the object lay almost\r\ndead ahead, we made directly for it, but before we got very close a\r\nCape Ann schooner lay to and sent a boat's crew to inspect what now\r\nplainly appeared to be a monstrous carcass of some species or other.\r\nWe finally hove to, about a ship's length off, and took a leisurely\r\nsurvey of the thing. It was dead, and floated on the water, with its\r\nbelly, of a dirty brown color, up. It head was at least twenty feet\r\nlong, and about ten feet through at the thickest point. About midway\r\nof the body, which was, I should guess, about forty feet long, were\r\ntwo fins, of a clear white, each about twelve feet in length. The body\r\nseemed to taper from the back of the head down to the size of a small\r\nlog, distinct from the whale tribe, as the end had nothing that looked\r\nlike a fluke. The shape of the creature's head was more like a tierce\r\nthan anything I can liken it to. I have seen almost all kinds of\r\nshapes that can be found in these waters, but never saw the like of\r\nthis before.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, off Seguin, I saw shooting through the water a thing\r\nwhich, I think, resembled this creature considerably, but I didn't\r\nget close enough to it to say for certain. The men from the Cape Ann\r\nschooner got on this dead creature, and one of the boys cut a double\r\nshuffle on its belly, which for all the world looked like the bottom\r\nof a schooner covered with barnacles and seaweed by the weather. We\r\nshould have towed the thing to Portland had there been any wind,\r\nbut as there wasn't, we steered away and left it. What sort of a sea\r\nmonster this was I can't say for sure, but in my opinion it was the\r\noriginal 'sea serpent,' which has been seen once in a while for years\r\npast, and which, when alive, was too swift a swimmer for any sailing\r\nvessel to get alongside of.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of the captain of the \"Cape Ann schooner\" will be in order\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAXIM'S NEW GAS MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nSIMPLE AND CHEAP PROCESS OF GAS MAKING.\r\n\r\nWhen a current of air is passed over the surface of gasoline it\r\nbecomes carbureted or charged with its vapors to saturation. Air thus\r\ncharged is somewhat heavier than pure air, and when passed through an\r\nArgand or bat's wing burner, it burns with a brilliant white flame.\r\nNothing would seem easier than to make a machine that would force\r\na current of air through, over, or on some material saturated with\r\ngasoline, and this apparently simple process has led many into\r\nattempts to make a successful gas machine. Many fortunes have been\r\nspent by the unscientific in the chase after this, to them, _ignis\r\nfatuus_. The stumbling block which has wrecked so many enterprises\r\nin this line has been the cold produced by the evaporation of the\r\ngasoline. One pound of gasoline, in passing from a liquid to a vapor,\r\nrequires about as much heat as would be required to melt two pounds of\r\ncast iron. It is therefore obvious that where no heat is supplied,\r\nthe gasoline, air, and machine must soon become very cold when any\r\nconsiderable quantity of gas is being made. The heat must come from\r\nsomewhere, and as none is supplied, it is taken from the apparatus,\r\nair, and gasoline, making them very cold. A beautiful and simple\r\nexperiment to illustrate this refrigeration can be made as follows:\r\nPlace a gill of water in a common washbasin, then pour over it\r\none pint of light gasoline; shake the basin, and blow the liquids\r\nvigorously, when very soon the basin will become intensely cold--the\r\nwater will freeze, and may be taken out in the form of a snowball.\r\nIf the water and basin are hot, and the experiment performed in a hot\r\nroom or in the sun, it is much more striking.[1]\r\n\r\nThis refrigeration operates upon the gas as follows: Air will take up\r\nand hold in suspension any volatile liquid in proportion to the square\r\nof its temperature, so that when the temperature of the gasoline and\r\nair have fallen off one half, the quantity of gasoline in the air has\r\nfallen off three quarters, and the light is destroyed. The quality of\r\nthe gas in such machines varies from a rich smoky flame to a pale\r\nblue and blowing flame in a short time. Every change of quality in the\r\nliquid, temperature of the apparatus, or number of burners used causes\r\na vexatious change in the quality of the gas. If heat is applied at\r\nthe right time and in the right quantity it is not so bad, but too\r\nmuch heat, or neglecting to regulate it properly, converts the machine\r\ninto a still, the condenser of which is the pipes of the building\r\nlighted, when danger is added to vexation. About ten years ago a\r\nmachine was illustrated in these columns that obviated all these\r\ntroubles; it was the invention of the well known mechanical engineer,\r\nHiram S. Maxim, of this city. His machine was on an entirely new\r\nprinciple, and has since gone into general use. It was intricate and\r\nsomewhat expensive, but it performed its work well. Messrs. A. T.\r\nStewart & Co. use them largely in their mills and hotels. Mr. Maxim\r\nmade one of six thousand burner capacity for the Grand Union Hotel,\r\nSaratoga Springs, it being the largest gas machine ever built. It has\r\nsupplied gas of an unvarying quality for six years, and is as good as\r\nnew to-day.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the cost as far as possible, Mr. Maxim has designed a new\r\nmachine on another principle, which we herewith illustrate. Fig. 1\r\nshows the machine in perspective, and Fig. 2 is a sectional view.\r\nThe vertical cylinder is a common gas holder of sheet brass. It is 36\r\ninches in diameter for a thousand burner machine. The operative parts\r\nof the machine are best shown in the sectional view, which represents\r\nthe portion of the machine called the injector. A is a steam chamber\r\nsupplied with four or more pounds of steam through the pipe, K. B is\r\nthe gasoline supply pipe, and C the air supply. D is an index valve.\r\nThe operation is as follows: Steam being in the chamber, A, the\r\ndescent of the holder opens the valve, M, and allows the steam to\r\n[_Continued on page 4._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This experiment should not be tried in the vicinity of\r\na gaslight or fire.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN\r\n\r\nESTABLISHED 1845\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO., EDITORS AND PROPRIETORS.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY AT NO. 37 PARK ROW, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n O.

There\r\nwere ten exhibitors, and the inherent and comparative merits of the\r\nvarious exhibits were rated under ten heads on the basis of 100 points\r\n\"for the highest degree of excellence.\" There were British, German,\r\nFrench, Swiss, and American competitors; and while the scores of the\r\nnine European exhibitors footed up totals ranging from 76 to 686,\r\ntheir average being 389-1/3, the total of the Waltham Watch Company\r\nwas 981. In detail this remarkable score stood thus: Originality,\r\n98; invention and discovery, 95; utility and quality of material,\r\n95; skill in workmanship, 93; fitness for purpose intended, 100;\r\nadaptation to public wants, 100; economy, 100; cost, 100; finish and\r\nelegance of cases, 100; timekeeping qualities, 100. Total, 981.\r\n\r\nThe timekeeping tests were made, as the report points out, by Prof.\r\nH. C. Russell, Astronomer Royal at the Sydney Observatory; and it is\r\nespecially noted that while the majority of the watches tested had\r\nbeen made for exhibition purposes, and specially prepared for that\r\nend, the exhibit of the American company was the ordinary and regular\r\nproduct of the factory, such as is finished every day. Another\r\nevidence of the superiority of the American system, as emphasized in\r\nthe report, is the fact that a sixth grade Waltham watch, one of the\r\ncheapest tested, showed a better performance than many very expensive\r\nand otherwise first class watches of other makes.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the victory is happily drawn in the following editorial\r\nreview of the contest and its lessons, by the Sydney _Morning Herald_\r\nof April 14, last:\r\n\r\n\"The report of the judges in horology, which we published on Saturday\r\nlast, was a document of more than ordinary interest. The slightest\r\nglance at it will show that the judges brought no small amount of\r\nability and industry to their task. In many other classes of exhibits\r\njudging must, to no small extent, be a matter of opinion. There is\r\nno absolute test by which one photograph, for example, or one oil\r\npainting can be decided to be superior to another. In exhibits of\r\nthis kind much must be left to the taste of the critic. Watches and\r\nchronometers, on the other hand, can be submitted to the minutest\r\ntests. The care and trouble which these require are not small, but\r\nthe issue is sufficiently important to warrant all the labor which\r\nthe judges in horology brought to their work. Time-keepers that can be\r\nrelied upon in all weathers and in all climates, and that are within\r\nreach of all classes, are a luxury of no common order, but to a large\r\nnumber of persons they are a necessity also. In these fast days, when\r\neverything must be done to time, it is for a variety of purposes\r\nfound necessary to make accurate divisions, not merely of the days\r\nand hours, but of the minutes and seconds also. The verdict which the\r\njudges in our Exhibition have pronounced on the Waltham watches is\r\none of which any company might be proud; but the facts on which the\r\nverdict is based are as interesting to the public at large as to the\r\nparties immediately concerned. One of the secrets of American progress\r\nlies first in the invention of machinery, and then in its application\r\nto almost all descriptions of industry. It is the bringing of\r\nmachinery to every branch of watchmaking that is enabling Americans to\r\nbeat the world in this as well as in many other things.\r\n\r\n\"There has been a general belief that a machine-made watch is not to\r\nbe compared to one that is hand-made, and that on this account the\r\nEnglish watch must always hold its own against the American. This\r\nbelief will have to be given up, if it is not given up already. It has\r\nnow been established that machinery can be used for the purposes of\r\nwatchmaking with quite as much success as for those of agriculture.\r\nThe Americans are showing that they can make better watches than\r\nthe Swiss or the English, but, what is of equal importance, they\r\nare showing that they can make them for less money. The boast of the\r\nYankees is that they can turn out work cheaper and better than anybody\r\nelse, and that for that reason the world must take their products.\r\nIt would be difficult to prove that in some departments the boast is\r\nwholly without foundation. The American mechanic is paid better than\r\nthe English mechanic, and yet the work which he turns out can, as a\r\nrule, be sold for less. The reason is, not only that he works harder,\r\nbut that the assistance of machinery enables him to produce the\r\nlargest result by the smallest amount of labor.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Brassey, who believes that the workmen of his own country are\r\nequal if not superior to any in the world, maintains that an English\r\nmechanic can do more work than an American mechanic. The American\r\nreally does more, because the inducements to industry are greater, and\r\nbecause he has better machinery. The success of the Waltham Company\r\nhas furnished a striking instance of this. This company has now not\r\nonly well-nigh driven foreign watchmaking companies out of America,\r\nbut it has shown that it can more than compete with them on their own\r\nground. This arises partly from the fact that it can turn out the best\r\nwork on a large scale, but also from the fact that the principle on\r\nwhich it operates enables it to do all this economically. The\r\nWaltham Company claims to have arrived at simplicity, uniformity, and\r\nprecision in the manufacture of watches, and the report of our judges\r\nshows that its claim is well founded. One of its discoveries was that\r\na simple instrument, where simplicity is possible, will cost less and\r\nbe worth more than a complicated one. Another was that the making\r\nof all instruments of the same grade exactly alike, so that the part\r\nwhich belongs to one belongs to the whole, will not only facilitate\r\nmanufacture, but will greatly economize it. A third was, that\r\nthese properties of simplicity and interchangeability are the best\r\nguarantees of perfect exactitude. The success which the Americans have\r\nreached in this as well as in other branches of industry, ought\r\nto excite the gratitude rather than the jealousy of the world. Any\r\ncompany or nation that shows how a maximum of efficiency can be\r\nreached by a minimum of labor confers a benefit on mankind. This\r\nour American cousins have done in other spheres besides that of\r\nwatchmaking. There are branches of the prosperity of the Americans\r\nthat are traceable to the extent of their territory and the fertility\r\nof their soil; but the triumph of their machinery has been the result\r\nof their inventiveness and of their enterprise, and for that reason it\r\npoints a moral that Australians might profitably observe.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA REMARKABLE LITTLE STEAMER.\r\n\r\nThere is soon to set sail from London for New York a new and\r\nremarkable little steamer of 70 tons gross burden, named the\r\nAnthracite, designed to exhibit the advanced engineering ideas of\r\nMr. Loftus Perkins, of England. The distinctive peculiarities of this\r\nsteamer are the very high steam pressure that she carries--350 to 500\r\nlb. to the square inch, and the small consumption of fuel--one pound\r\nof coal per hour per horsepower. A trial trip of this new little boat\r\nwas lately made of 46 miles, during which 350 lb. steam pressure was\r\nsteadily maintained, 132 revolutions per minute of propeller, and a\r\nspeed of eight knots per hour. Other vessels, some of larger size than\r\nthe above, have been built on the Perkins system, and are running\r\nin England. One of them, the yacht Emily, carries 500 lb. boiler\r\npressure. Most of our readers are familiar with Mr. Perkins' system,\r\nwhich has been fully described in our columns. Those who may wish to\r\nrefer thereto are directed to an interesting article by Mr. Perkins,\r\nwith engravings, published in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, No.\r\n81, July 21, 1877; also to the description of the steam ferry boat,\r\nrun on this principle, given with three pages of engravings in our\r\nSUPPLEMENT No. 217.\r\n\r\nEngineering theory and practice have for a long time plainly pointed\r\nto high steam pressures as one of the surest ways to economy of fuel.\r\nTwenty five years ago our ocean steamers carried only 16 lb. pressure\r\nto the inch, and burned 5 to 6 lb. of coal per hour per horse power.\r\nTo-day they are carrying 75 lb. pressure, and burning 21/2 to 3 lb. of\r\ncoal per hour per horse power.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 the Britannia, one of the finest steamers of the Cunard line\r\nplying between this country and England, burned 5,291 lb. of coal for\r\neach ton of paying freight she carried, her speed, then considered\r\nfast, being 81/2 knots per hour. In 1877 the Britannic, speed 15.6 knots\r\nper hour, burned only 551 lb. of coal per ton of freight carried.\r\n\r\nAlthough our present steamers are making fast time and are very\r\neconomical as compared with earlier vessels, still it is a lamentable\r\nfact that on the largest and finest of them, furnished with all the\r\nlatest improvements and best appliances to secure economy, worked by\r\nthe most careful and intelligent engineers, we succeed in putting\r\ninto our steam only about one tenth of the heat realized in our\r\nboiler fire, the remaining nine-tenths of the heat being lost. Only in\r\nproportion as we make our steam hotter, and expanding it more, shall\r\nwe economize in fuel. In this respect the voyage of the Anthracite is\r\ndesigned by her owners, we presume, to be an eye-opener for steamboat\r\nowners, not only in this country but throughout the world. If a little\r\nbit of a boat like this, 84 feet long, 16 feet beam, and 10 feet deep,\r\ncan carry its own coal and water across the Atlantic, with a pressure\r\nof 350 to 500 lb. to the inch, and on one pound of coal per horse\r\npower, the natural inference is that our great steamers, when fitted\r\nwith the same system, will realize far better results. The change from\r\nthree pounds of coal to one pound per horse power means a shaving of\r\ntwo thirds in the coal bill, which is always an enormous item in the\r\nexpenses of large boats. We ought to add that another peculiarity of\r\nthe Anthracite is that she uses the same boiler water over and over,\r\nonly a trifle of fresh water being supplied to make good the slight\r\nwaste. Our New York steamboat men, who have to pay so dear for Croton\r\nwater, will be likely to examine the water tank of the Anthracite with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STRANGE EPIDEMIC.\r\n\r\nOn the night of Tuesday, June 15, a remarkable epidemic fell upon\r\nseveral towns in western Massachusetts, the town of Adams\r\nsuffering most severely. Out of a population of 6,000, several\r\nhundred--variously estimated from 600 to over 1,000--were prostrated\r\nby a disease resembling cholera morbus. The symptoms were first\r\ndizziness, then great nausea, followed by vomiting and prolonged\r\npurging, and in some cases delirium. A belt of country two or three\r\nmiles in width and several miles long was thus afflicted, beginning at\r\nthe west, the whole number of victims being estimated at from 1,200 to\r\n1,500. No deaths are reported.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the epidemic is not known, but seems most likely to have\r\nbeen atmospheric. For some time the weather had been dry and hot.\r\nA heavy local rain fell during the evening, and was followed by or\r\nattended with a sudden and great lowering of the temperature. A chilly\r\nfog hung over the belt of country invaded by the disease, and a heavy\r\n\"swampy\" odor and taste were in the air.\r\n\r\nThe malady reached its climax in about twenty-four hours. It was first\r\nsuspected that the water supply had been somehow poisoned, but many\r\npeople who had not used the water were prostrated, while others\r\nwho used it freely escaped. Adams has hitherto been regarded as an\r\nexceptionally healthy town, and the surrounding country is high and\r\nwholesome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNONADING OF OIL TANKS.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Friday, June 11, lightning struck an oil tank\r\nbelonging to the Tidioute and Titusville Pipe Line, at Titusville,\r\nPa. The fire thus kindled, raged until Sunday night, consuming 200,000\r\nbarrels of oil, crude and refined, and destroying property to the\r\namount of $1,500,000. The most appalling feature in this fire was the\r\nsuccessive \"boiling over\" of oil from burning tanks of the liquid.\r\nTo empty rapidly a tank containing 20,000 barrels of oil, while the\r\nlatter is on fire, is no easy matter. The pipes connected with the\r\ntanks were utterly inadequate to remove the oil rapidly enough to rob\r\nthe \"boiling over\" of its terrors. A happy thought suggested itself\r\non Friday to Mr. D. R. Herron, of the Titusville Battery. Obtaining\r\npermission, Mr. Herron brought out one of the Parrott guns of the\r\nbattery, loaded it with solid shot, and began firing against the\r\nthree-eighths iron sheets of the distant blazing tank. The first\r\nshot glanced, but subsequent volleys pierced the shell of the tank,\r\nreleasing a large quantity of oil that otherwise would have fed the\r\nflames. The battery then moved on to the Emery tank, also burning, and\r\nlastly to the Acme tank. Large rents were made in all these, and the\r\nliberated oil ran harmlessly down into a stream. This novel target\r\npractice greatly shortened the duration of the fire at these tanks,\r\nand so drained them that the flames died out for want of fuel, and no\r\n\"boiling over\" resulted.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar attraction for lightning which these iron oil tanks\r\nappear to possess has been several times referred to in our columns.\r\nWhenever a thunderstorm passes fairly over one of them it seems to be\r\ndevoted to destruction. Millions of dollars' worth of property have\r\nthus been destroyed. No practical safeguard has yet been suggested.\r\n\r\nOrdinary buildings, when properly provided with rods that are\r\nwell grounded in the earth, are comparatively safe from lightning.\r\nStructures made of iron and simply resting upon the earth, without\r\nrods, are also exempt from electrical damage. Such structures always\r\npresent a continuous body of conducting material for the free passage\r\nof electricity to earth. Why is it, then, that iron oil tanks form\r\nsuch conspicuous exceptions to our common experience with lightning?\r\nRods put on other structures save them; but rods have been put on oil\r\ntanks, masts with rods have surrounded the tanks, but the tanks were\r\nexploded by lightning all the same.\r\n\r\nWe will repeat a possible explanation which we have heretofore given.\r\nFrom every oil tank, according to our theory, there is a constant\r\nescape of light hydrocarbon vapor, which forms a permanent cloud or\r\ncolumn, rising to a great height above the tanks, far above any\r\nrod that could be erected. This vapor rod is a conductor, which the\r\nlightning naturally follows, sets on fire the vapor, and explodes the\r\ntank.\r\n\r\nA column of heated air or vapor rising from a chimney is well known\r\nto be a conductor for lightning; the rise of hydrocarbon vapors is\r\nillustrated by the balloon.\r\n\r\nIf the theory we have outlined is correct, the remedy for the\r\nelectrical explosion of oil tanks is to be found in such a treatment\r\nof the oil, or such a construction of tank, as shall prevent any\r\nescape of the light vapors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVIGATION IN FOGS.\r\n\r\nThe disastrous collision of the Sound steamers Narragansett and\r\nStonington was quickly followed by one at sea, by which two great\r\npassenger ships escaped instant destruction almost by a hair's\r\nbreadth.\r\n\r\nShortly after noon, Monday, June 12, the National Line steamship\r\nQueen, bound from London to New York, and within 300 miles of her\r\njourney's end, ran into the Anchor Line steamship Anchoria, on the way\r\nfrom New York to Glasgow. The bow of the Queen struck the Anchoria on\r\nthe port side, about twenty feet abaft the foremast, smashing a great\r\nhole through the iron hull. Two compartments of the Anchoria filled\r\nimmediately, but the partitions stood firm, and the other compartments\r\nsufficed to keep the vessel afloat. The bow of the Queen was badly\r\ncrushed, and her forward compartment was flooded. Fortunately the\r\nbulkhead proved stanch, and the ship was saved. The fog was very\r\nthick, and both ships were going at full speed. It is said that the\r\ncaptain of the Anchoria mistook the whistle of the Queen for that of\r\nthe Anchoria's companion vessel, the Victoria, which left New York at\r\nthe same time, and was probably not far away, and before the error was\r\ndiscovered the ships were too close to avoid the catastrophe. Had the\r\nsea been rough or the partitions less stanch, both ships must have\r\ngone to the bottom almost instantly.\r\n\r\nThe passengers of the Anchoria were transferred to the Queen, which\r\nwas least hurt, and the two ships sailed together for New York,\r\narriving Tuesday noon.\r\n\r\nThese two collisions, coming in such quick succession and imperiling\r\nso many lives, give terrible emphasis to the dangers attending\r\nnavigation in foggy weather. They make very pertinent also the query\r\nwhether the means now employed for discovering the position\r\nand nearness of unseen vessels are at all commensurate with the\r\nnecessities of the case, or with the means already known, and known\r\nto be well calculated to prevent such dangers. In a dense fog the\r\nordinary ship's light is visible scarcely more than a ship's length;\r\nand as it proved in the case of the Narragansett and Stonington, the\r\ntime between thus sighting an approaching vessel and the instant of\r\ncollision is fatally brief. The recent test of electric headlights\r\nfor ships in this harbor clearly demonstrated the possibility of\r\nprojecting a beam of electric light through the densest fog for a\r\nthousand feet or more, and through ordinary fogs a distance several\r\ntimes as great.\r\n\r\nExcept in very rough weather the steam whistle can be heard a long\r\ndistance, but it is liable to be a treacherous guide. It is not always\r\npossible to determine by the ear alone the direction from which a\r\nsound comes; and it would seem that a mistake of this nature was made\r\non the Stonington, since the order intended to change her course\r\naway from that of the Narragansett only served to precipitate the\r\ncollision. Had the whistle of the Queen signaled her course it could\r\nnot have been mistaken for that of a ship sailing in the opposite\r\ndirection, and the safety of two great floating hotels and their\r\noccupants would not have been imperiled thereby.\r\n\r\nMeans for the better penetration of fogs, for determining the\r\ndirection of unseen sources of sounds, and for enabling steamers to\r\nannounce to all within hearing the course they are pursuing, seem\r\ntherefore to be imperative necessities on shipboard. The first is\r\nfurnished by the electric headlight, with a system of projection\r\nsimilar to but more efficient than that used on locomotives. The last\r\nwould be provided by an efficient code of whistle signals to indicate\r\nthe several points of compass. The second need is supplied by the\r\ninstrument figured in the accompanying illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROFESSOR MAYER'S TOPOPHONE.]\r\n\r\nThe aim of the topophone, which was invented and patented by Professor\r\nA. M. Mayer, last winter, is to enable the user to determine quickly\r\nand surely the exact direction and position of any source of sound.\r\nOur figure shows a portable style of the instrument; for use\r\non ship-board it would probably form one of the fixtures of the\r\npilot-house or the \"bridge,\" or both. In most cases arising in sailing\r\nthrough fogs, it would be enough for the captain or pilot to be\r\nsure of the exact direction of a fog horn, whistling buoy, or steam\r\nwhistle; and for this a single aural observation suffices.\r\n\r\nEvery one has twirled a tuning fork before the ear, and listened to\r\nthe alternate swelling and sinking of the sound, as the sound waves\r\nfrom one tine re-enforce or counteract those from the other tine. The\r\ntopophone is based upon the same fact, namely, the power of any sound\r\nto augment or destroy another of the same pitch, when ranged so that\r\nthe sound waves of each act in unison with or in opposition to those\r\nof the other.\r\n\r\nBriefly described, the topophone consists of two resonators (or any\r\nother sound receivers) attached to a connecting bar or shoulder rest.\r\nThe sound receivers are joined by flexible tubes, which unite for part\r\nof their length, and from which ear tubes proceed. One tube, it will\r\nbe observed, carries a telescopic device by which its length can be\r\nvaried. When the two resonators face the direction whence a sound\r\ncomes, so as to receive simultaneously the same sonorous impulse, and\r\nare joined by tubes of equal length, the sound waves received from\r\nthem will necessarily re-enforce each other and the sound will be\r\naugmented. If, on the contrary, the resonators being in the same\r\nposition as regards the source of sound, the resonator tubes differ in\r\nlength by half the wave length of the sound, the impulse from the one\r\nneutralizes that from the other, and the sound is obliterated.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in determining the direction of the source of any sound\r\nwith this instrument, the observer, guided by the varying intensity\r\nof the sound transmitted by the resonators, turns until their\r\nopenings touch the same sound waves simultaneously, which position\r\nhe recognizes either by the great augmentation of the sound (when the\r\ntube lengths are equal), or by the cessation of the sound, when the\r\ntubes vary so that the interference of the sound waves is perfect. In\r\neither case the determination of the direction of the source of the\r\nsound is almost instantaneous, and the two methods may be successively\r\nemployed as checks upon each other's report.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that with such a help the pilot in a fog need never be\r\nlong in doubt as to the direction of a warning signal; and if need\r\nbe he can without much delay, by successive observations and a little\r\ncalculation, determine, approximately at least, the distance of the\r\nsounding body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF AGE ON THE QUALITY OF IRON.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bauschinger, in 1878, tested iron taken from a chain bridge\r\nbuilt in 1829, and found that fifty years of use had not perceptibly\r\naltered its quality--either its strength or its elasticity--as\r\nreported at the time of its erection. He also examined metal from\r\nanother bridge built in 1852, and found that the average quality\r\nremained as given by Von Pauli at the time of its erection.\r\n\r\nProfessor Thurston, testing pieces of the wire cable of the Fairmount\r\nSuspension Bridge, recently taken down at Philadelphia, after about\r\nforty years' use, found the iron to have a tenacity and elasticity\r\nand a ductility fully equal to the best wire of same size found in the\r\nmarket to-day.\r\n\r\nHe therefore concludes that iron subjected to strains such as are met\r\nwith in properly designed bridges does not deteriorate with age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COLLISION BETWEEN LARGE PASSENGER STEAMERS.\r\n\r\nDuring a fog near midnight, June 11, two of the large passenger\r\nsteamers plying on Long Island Sound, Stonington line, between New\r\nYork and Boston, came in collision, while running at considerable\r\nspeed. One of the boats, the Narragansett, was struck near the middle,\r\nher side cut open, and a smoke-pipe knocked over, which made a down\r\ndraught through the furnace, driving out a great sheet of burning\r\ngas into the cabins and between decks, by which the vessel was set on\r\nfire, at the same time the opening in her side caused her to begin\r\nto sink. Some three hundred passengers were on board, and a frightful\r\nscene of confusion followed. Happily there was a plentiful supply\r\nof life-preservers, some life-rafts, and a few life-boats. There was\r\ndelay in lowering the boats, but the rafts, life-preservers, chairs,\r\nand other floatables served to support most of the unfortunate people,\r\nwho, to escape the flames, were obliged to leap quickly into the\r\nwater. About fifty lives were lost; the remainder were rescued by\r\nboats from another steamer, the New York, also by help sent from the\r\nother damaged vessel, the Stonington.\r\n\r\nIt seems remarkable that so many were saved. This calamity illustrates\r\nthe necessity for further effort on the part of inventors to discover\r\nnew and improved means for fog signaling, saving life, preventing the\r\nspread of fires, and keeping vessels afloat. Most of the large local\r\nsteamers that communicate with New York are veritable palaces,\r\nbuilt regardless of expense, and supplied with every known reliable\r\nappliance for safety; but the occurrence of accidents like this and\r\ntheir disastrous results show that much remains to be done before\r\nnavigation, even upon smooth waters, can be considered secure.\r\n\r\nThe life-rafts of the Narragansett seem to have proved more useful\r\nthan the life-boats in rescuing the drowning people, the rafts being\r\nmore quickly and easily launched, requiring less skill, etc.\r\n\r\nThe upperworks of our river and Sound passenger steamers consist at\r\npresent of a mass of light, dry woodwork, forming cabins that are very\r\ncomfortable and commodious for travelers, but highly dangerous in case\r\nof fire.\r\n\r\nThe collision of river steamers above described was followed a few\r\nhours later by a collision between two great ocean steamers, accounts\r\nof which we give in another column.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHONORS TO AN AGED CHEMIST.\r\n\r\nThe chemists of Germany are collecting money for the purpose of\r\npresenting a gold medal to Prof. Woehler on his eightieth birthday,\r\nwhich will be July 31, 1880. Prof. Woehler is one of the most\r\ndistinguished as well as the oldest of living chemists. Himself\r\na pupil of old Berzelius, a contemporary of Liebig, and the loved\r\ninstructor of many of our best chemists, his name is equally respected\r\non both sides of the Atlantic. Profs. Jay and Chandler, of Columbia\r\nCollege, New York city, two of his former pupils, are receiving\r\ncontributions from those who wish to join in this well deserved\r\nmemorial.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSEVERANCE UNDER DIFFICULTIES.\r\n\r\nA good lesson to young people inclined to exaggerate the hinderances\r\nto their success in life, and to think that their chances are too poor\r\nto justify honest exertion, is furnished by a young colored man of\r\nColumbus, Ohio, F. P. Williams by name, now serving in that city as\r\ncensus enumerator. Several years ago he was run over by a train of\r\ncars, his arms being so mutilated that both had to be taken off near\r\nthe shoulder.

This produces a partial vacuum at L, and\r\ndraws air in at C. The air and steam pass with great rapidity through\r\nthe tube, G. The action of the air and steam produces another\r\npartial vacuum at N, which draws gasoline in through the pipe, B. The\r\nadjustment of the opening is such that one pound of steam draws in air\r\nsufficient for two pounds of gasoline. The heat of the steam is taken\r\nup by the refrigeration caused by the evaporation of the gasoline, so\r\nthat at E the compound is carbureted air and cold water. The tube, F,\r\npresents the curious phenomenon of being hot at _a_ and cold at _b_.\r\nIn one short piece of tube we have a hot retort and a cold condenser.\r\nThe supply of gasoline is regulated by the valve, D. The dash pot,\r\nH, prevents a too rapid action of the valve, I. Gas of any desired\r\ndensity may be made, and when once adjusted the gas does not vary. The\r\nburner used with this machine is made to produce the very best results\r\nattainable, and then the gas is regulated to a density and pressure\r\nto suit the burner. The nuisance of an adjustable burner is thus\r\nobviated.\r\n\r\nThe holder closes off the supply when full, and lets on a supply when\r\nnearly empty. Gasoline has been much improved within a few years. It\r\nis now so very cheap that the equivalent of one thousand feet of coal\r\ngas of standard quality may be equaled for sixty cents. Where no steam\r\nis at hand these machines are run with a small oil burner. They are\r\nbeing made by the Pennsylvania Globe Gas Light Co., 131 Arch St.,\r\nPhiladelphia, Pa., of from 100 to 10,000 burner power.\r\n\r\nThis machine was patented June 8, 1880.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 2.\r\n\r\nMAXIM'S GAS MACHINE--SECTION OF INJECTOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTION OF BOILER EXPLOSIONS.\r\n\r\nThis vexed problem has occupied the minds of engineers and inventors\r\nsince the introduction of steam as a motive power, and there are\r\nseveral theories of boiler explosions, each having its adherents. Of\r\ncourse there are conditions under which a boiler explosion is involved\r\nin no mystery; as, for example, when the water is dangerously low,\r\nwhen the safety valve is of insufficient capacity, or when it is\r\nunduly loaded; but there are other cases where an explosion cannot be\r\nrationally explained in the light of the well known theories.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel T. Lawson, of Wellsville, Ohio, has recently patented,\r\nin this and several other countries, a device for preventing boiler\r\nexplosions, which appears practical, and according to the testimony of\r\nscientific men the claims of the inventor are well founded.\r\n\r\nThe inventor, in explaining his invention, says that when water\r\nis superheated it becomes as explosive as gunpowder, exploding by\r\nbursting into steam from a reduction of pressure. When the engineer\r\nopens the throttle valve the cylinder is instantly filled with steam,\r\ncreating a vacuum to that extent in the boiler. The superheated water\r\nthen immediately rises to fill the vacuum, and is met by the valve,\r\ninstantly cutting off the escape into the cylinder; this causes a\r\nconcussion on every square inch in the boiler much greater than the\r\nregular pressure of the steam. There is abundant reason to believe\r\nthat it is this concussive action which causes the numerous and\r\nmysterious boiler explosions, and which cause is wholly independent of\r\nthe amount of water in the boiler; in fact, the greater the amount of\r\nwater in the boiler the more terrific the explosion.\r\n\r\nThis invention, which is based upon this theory, consists in reducing\r\nthe concussive strain produced by the impulsive and intermittent\r\nescape of steam to the cylinders to an approximately uniform pressure,\r\nby rendering the evolution or passage of steam from the water to the\r\nsteam space approximately constant and independent of the intermittent\r\ndischarges from the steam space to the cylinder. The means for\r\naccomplishing this consist in a boiler constructed with a partition,\r\nA, intervening between the water space and the space from which the\r\nsteam is taken to supply the cylinder, and feeding the steam as it\r\nis generated through valves or orifices, B, in the partition, of a\r\nsmaller size than the port or opening through which the steam passes\r\ninto the cylinder. By this means the normal steam pressure or steam\r\nsupply, when thus intermittently or alternately reduced, is restored\r\ngradually by reducing the flow from the water space to the steam\r\nspace, so that the transformation of water into steam is made\r\napproximately uniform in spite of the intermittent escape of steam\r\nthrough the cylinders, and the boiler is thus relieved of the constant\r\nwear and strain of the concussion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAWSON'S IMPROVED STEAM BOILER.]\r\n\r\nIn supplying steam from the water compartment to the steam\r\ncompartment, the inventor intends using a number of small\r\nperforations, not amounting in the aggregate to more than about one\r\ntwentieth the size of the cylinder port, in connection with a number\r\nof small valves to be under control of the engineer, so that the\r\namount of steam required can be readily regulated, yet carefully\r\navoiding the possibility of all, when opened to their utmost capacity,\r\nforming as large an opening as the valve through which the cylinder is\r\nsupplied. A number of small valves and perforations in the partition\r\nsheet between the water and steam compartments, will remedy that\r\nhitherto very general annoyance of water rising to and through the\r\nvalves, which is occasioned by pressure of steam upon the surface\r\nof the water, and when _one large_ valve is opened, the pressure is\r\npartly removed from the water immediately under it, consequently the\r\nwater rises through the valve. A number of small openings for the\r\nliberation of steam from the superheated water will remedy this\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Niels C.

Edwards, of New York city. The object of this invention is to\r\nfacilitate the performance of dental operations, such as the filling\r\nof teeth. It consists in a combined dental speculum, gag, and\r\nshield formed of a flaring or bonnet-shaped shell of metal, having\r\na longitudinal slot in its lower side to receive the teeth, and an\r\narched wire attached to its lower part, upon the opposite sides of\r\nthe forward end of the slot, to rest upon the teeth and support the\r\nforward part of the shell.\r\n\r\nAn improved coupling for the shafts of a wagon, which can be readily\r\nfastened to or unfastened from the axle, has been patented by Mr.\r\nWilliam W.

Van Depoele, of Detroit, Mich. The object of this invention is\r\nto automatically regulate the feed of the carbon in electric lights\r\naccording to the changes of resistance in the current caused by the\r\nconsumption of the carbon points, so as to prevent flickering and\r\nvariations in intensity of the light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROFORMING DURING SLEEP.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of chloroforming a person in sleep, without waking\r\nhim, having been disputed in a recent murder trial, Dr. J. V. Quimby,\r\nof Jersey City, was led to test the question experimentally. The\r\nresults were presented in a paper before the section of medical\r\njurisprudence at the meeting of the American Medical Association a few\r\ndays ago. Dr. Quimby made arrangements with a gentleman to enter his\r\nroom when he was asleep and apply chloroform to him. He did this with\r\nentire success, transferring the person from natural to artificial\r\nsleep without arousing him. He used about three drachms of Squibb's\r\nchloroform, and occupied about seven minutes in the operation. The\r\nsecond case was a boy of thirteen who had refused to take ether for a\r\nminor operation. Dr. Quimby advised the mother to give the boy a light\r\nsupper and put him to bed. She did so, and Dr. Quimby, calling when\r\nthe boy was asleep, administered the chloroform and performed the\r\noperation without awakening the boy. The third case was a boy of ten\r\nyears suffering from an abscess, and the same course was pursued with\r\nequal success. Two important inferences may be drawn from these cases,\r\nDr. Quimby said. Minor surgical operations may be done with perfect\r\nsafety and much more pleasantly than in the ordinary way, and,\r\nsecondly, a person somewhat skilled in the use of chloroform may enter\r\na sleeping apartment and administer chloroform with evil intentions\r\nwhile a person is asleep. Hence the use of this drug in the hands of\r\na criminal may become an effective instrument in the accomplishment of\r\nhis nefarious designs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED WATERING DIPPER.\r\n\r\nA convenient vessel for watering plants, sprinkling floors, and for\r\nother similar purposes is shown in the annexed engraving. It is simply\r\na dipper of the usual form, partly covered at the top by a shield, at\r\nthe center of which is fixed a sprinkler spout. The utility of this\r\nimprovement will be recognized without further description. It was\r\nrecently patented by Mr. R. Harrison, of Columbus, Miss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARRISON'S WATERING DIPPER]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED ELECTRIC LAMP.\r\n\r\nThe lamp shown in the engraving will be recognized as an Edison\r\nlamp, the vacuum globe and the carbon horseshoe being the principal\r\nelements. Mr. John H. Guest, a well known electrical inventor of\r\nBrooklyn, N. Y., judging from his own experience in fusing platinum\r\nwith glass in the manufacture of thermostatic fire alarms, concluded\r\nthat the principal trouble with the Edison lamp would be the entrance\r\nof air around the wires passing through the glass of the vacuum globe,\r\ndevised a simple plan of sealing the joint between the wires and the\r\nglass by means of mercury, thus interposing an effectual barrier to\r\nthe entrance of air at that point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUEST'S IMPROVED ELECTRIC LAMP, Fig 1 and Fig 2]\r\n\r\nThe invention is so clearly shown in the engraving that scarcely a\r\nword of explanation is necessary. In the lamp shown in Fig. 1, the\r\nwires that convey the current to the carbon horseshoe are sealed in\r\nthe ends of curved glass tubes communicating with the globe, and these\r\njoints are inclosed in small globes formed on the ends of the glass\r\ntubes and filled with mercury.\r\n\r\nIn this lamp Mr. Guest has made provision partially or wholly\r\npreventing the circulation of air, should any remain in the globe\r\nafter exhaustion with the air pump. The device by which this is\r\naccomplished is simply a small globe connected with the lower portion\r\nof the lamp globe by a contracted passage, the theory being that the\r\ncooler and heavier portion of the air will be drawn into the auxiliary\r\nglobe by its own gravity.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 shows a lamp in which the tubes that support the wires extend\r\ndownward into the lamp globe. These tubes at their junction with the\r\nvacuum globe are fused to the platinum conducting wires, and the tubes\r\nact simply as lateral supports to the wires inside the globe, allowing\r\nthe wires to expand freely lengthwise. The tubes are sealed outside\r\nthe globe in the manner shown in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement made by Mr. Guest consists in inclosing the ends\r\nof the platinum wire conductors in the ends of the material of the\r\ncarbon before it is carbonized, the wire being formed into a loop to\r\nincrease the conducting surface and to insure a good connection with\r\nthe carbon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR PRESERVING FRUIT.\r\n\r\nThe annexed engraving represents a simple apparatus for preserving\r\nfruit in its natural state, by means of a partial vacuum. The vessel\r\nis especially designed for the purpose, and is provided with an\r\nabsorbent which takes up whatever moisture may emanate from the fruit.\r\nThe vessel is preferably made of glass or earthenware, and is provided\r\nwith a cover having a packing ring and a device for receiving\r\nthe stems of the fruit. The cover is secured to the vessel by an\r\nadjustable screw clamp. In the bottom of the vessel there is an\r\nabsorbing ring made of burnt or dried clay, which absorbs the moisture\r\nescaping from the fruit. The air in the vessel is rarefied either\r\nby heat or by the application of an air pump to the opening in the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus was recently patented by Mr. Carl J. Renz, of Hudson,\r\nN. Y.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRUIT-PRESERVING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW PROCESS FOR PRINTING GOLD AND SILVER COLORS ON CARPETINGS AND\r\nOTHER TEXTILES.\r\n\r\n(TRANSLATED FOR THE _COMMERCIAL BULLETIN._)\r\n\r\n\r\nGold and silver designs for carpeting and oilcloths have been hitherto\r\nprepared in the following manner: The gold or silver were put in\r\nleaves or bronze powder on the designs, which were printed with a\r\nvarnish of linseed oil, or similar adhesive. The bronze thus attached\r\ndid not possess much firmness, and the method was necessarily\r\nexpensive. The method recently adopted by Wohlforth is as follows:\r\nThe bronze powder is united at once to printing material. The liquid\r\nsilicate of potash, or of oxide of sodium, answers this purpose. One\r\npart, by weight, of gold, silver, or bronze powder, along with two\r\nparts of the silicate, will give a print color, which is easily\r\ntransferable by rollers to paper, oilcloth, and woods and metals. The\r\nbronze thus printed dries very rapidly, and cannot be taken off by\r\noil or water, unless they are boiling. It bears light and heat\r\nequally well, and especially sulphureted hydrogen, which has such\r\na destructive effect on bronzes put on in the form of powder. It is\r\nrecommended to thin the mass by an addition of warm water, 10 to 20\r\nper cent, so as to keep it from becoming too hard during the process\r\nof printing. An addition of glycerine or sirup, of 5 to 10 per cent.,\r\nwill be even preferable. The bronze color remaining on the printing\r\nforms can be taken off by warm water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EDISON ORE SEPARATOR NOT NEW\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Scientific American:_\r\n\r\nIn your issue of June 19, 1880, I notice an illustration of an\r\nelectro-magnetic ore separator invented by Mr. Edison, and patented\r\nJune 1, 1880.\r\n\r\nA device absolutely identical with this has been in use for the past\r\nten or fifteen years at the emery works at Chester, Hampden county,\r\nMass. I there saw it in use myself in November, 1876, and was\r\ninformed, I think by Mr. Ames, that it was not patented, and that no\r\nvalid patent could be granted upon it by reason of its long continued\r\npublic use.\r\n\r\nMy uncle, John S. Williams, of this city, president of the Ore Knob\r\nCopper Company, had heard of the machine, and sent me to Chester with\r\na view to purchasing the right to use it at the Ore Knob Copper Works,\r\nin Ashe county, North Carolina. On my return to Baltimore I had the\r\nmagnets constructed by Watts & Co., electricians, on November 24,\r\n1876, for a large machine, similar to the one at Chester, which\r\nmachine was completed about December 10, 1876, and practically tested\r\nat No. 52 Commerce St., Baltimore. It was sent to the Ore Knob Mine\r\nabout Christmas, 1876, to be used in separating magnetic oxide of iron\r\nfrom the copper ore, and, for aught I know to the contrary, is in use\r\nthere yet. This is a striking instance of how history repeats itself\r\nin inventions. Mr. Edison is doubtless an original inventor of the\r\ndevice, but he most certainly is not the first inventor.\r\n\r\nR.

It is a slate\r\nwasher, consisting of two pieces of metal stamped up so as to form a\r\nholder for the sponge at the top and the cloth drier at the bottom.\r\nThey also form a tubular receptacle containing a supply sponge, which\r\nis moistened by removing the corks at the ends.\r\n\r\nThis invention was recently patented by Mr. Jacob A.

All the power of the lower falls, save what is needed to run two\r\nwheels for factories already in operation, has been purchased by\r\nthe inventor of the system, and a promising beginning has been made.\r\nAccording to the Rochester _Union_, a large gang of men are at work\r\nbuilding the crib just below the falls on the east side of the river\r\nin a cove which seems to have been made by nature for this purpose.\r\nThis foundation is 100 feet long by 75 feet wide, and will have an\r\naverage depth of 13 feet. It is being constructed of solid logs of oak\r\ntimber bolted together, and the center will be filled with stone. On\r\nthe top of the crib will be erected the derrick, 125 feet high, and\r\nthe water will pour into it from the top of the falls through the\r\nbulkheads at one end of the dam. The stand pipes will run from the\r\ntop of the derrick to the cylinders on the crib, which will be in the\r\nneighborhood of 500 feet long. The whole machinery will be roofed in.\r\nThe difficulty in the way of getting the materials to the place,\r\nthey all having to be lowered over the falls, makes the work of\r\nconstruction somewhat slow. It is expected, however, that the first\r\napplication of the system to the propulsion of street cars will be\r\npossible in September next.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe commencement exercises took place on June 16 and 17, and were of a\r\nvery interesting nature.

There is, however, but one theory\r\nwhich has been generally adopted by scientific men, formulated by\r\nW. S. Keyes, General Manager of the Chrysolite Iron and Little Chief\r\nMines, and substantiated by the mute testimony of the fossil remains\r\nthat fix the geologic data. The theory is substantially as follows:\r\n\r\nA shallow sea overspread this entire region. An even bed of limestone,\r\ndolomitic, was formed by the myriads of shell-fish that subsisted in\r\nthis shallow sea. From some natural convulsion the waters flowed off,\r\nleaving the sedimentary deposits. Subsequently the porphyritic rock\r\nflowed over the surface in a pasty mass, covering the limestone. There\r\nthen followed two processes of ore making. The first was through the\r\nmineralizing action of heated and ore depositing waters, coming up out\r\nof the depths, and impregnating and permeating the hanging and foot\r\nwalls of the contact. No free oxygen was contained in these waters;\r\nneither did they carry any chlorides or chlorobromides, wherein\r\nconsists the present richness of Leadville's ores; but in the first\r\nprocess the ore was entirely in the form of sulphurets.\r\n\r\nThe second process was initiated by the uplifting of the mountain\r\nranges to their present height, at which time the diorites, those ore\r\nindicators of the globe, uprose through the sedimentary strata.\r\nThus was the original surface of deposit bent and folded, and not\r\nunfrequently entirely broken. The surface waters carrying free oxygen\r\nand free carbonic acid now penetrated along the contact, and oxidized\r\nthe sulphurets, which formed free sulphuric acid, giving rise to\r\nthe sulphates and sulpho-carbonates. The irresistible law of gravity\r\ndistributed these sulphates, these oxides, and these carbonates in\r\nvast bonanzas, that have been the wonder of the world. The fossil\r\ntrilobites of this region identify it with the silver lead districts\r\nof Nevada, Utah, and Mexico. It is not anomalous, but simply richer\r\nthan its sister regions to the West and South.\r\n\r\nThe output of ore from the Leadville mines last year (1879) aggregated\r\n122,483 tons, which represents a value of $11,477,046. That is to say,\r\nthere was an average yield at $90 per ton, or just $31,443.96 each\r\nday. On the first day of May of the present year (1880), the returns\r\nfrom thirty-seven of the leading mines gave a total daily output\r\nof 8991/2 tons of ore, yielding, at the low average of $90 per ton,\r\nsomething like $80,955 per day. The world's history of silver mining\r\nin the past shows nothing like this for so young a camp. Scarcely a\r\nmonth passes without opening up some new and vast carbonate deposits.\r\nThe territory has not even been thoroughly prospected; and the future\r\nyield of the royal metal will far eclipse its past production.\r\n\r\nIt might not be uninteresting in this connection to give something\r\nregarding the sampling and milling of ores. One of the most complete\r\nconcerns engaged in this business anywhere in the country is that of\r\nAugustus R. Meyer & Co. This establishment has grown with the growth\r\nand development of this carbonate district. The business was first\r\nestablished as long ago as the year 1877 (before Little Pittsburg was\r\ndreamed of). A little log house, a relic of seventeen years previous,\r\nwas found sufficiently ample for the needs of the business of that\r\nperiod. However, it was not long before additions had to be made\r\nand new buildings erected. In the year 1879 the present company was\r\nincorporated with a capital stock of $50,000, and every preparation\r\nthat money and business sagacity could effect was made to meet the\r\ndemands of the prosperous era, that has built a mining metropolis\r\n10,240 feet above the sea level, at the base of the great continental\r\ndivide. As at present constituted the premises of the company comprise\r\nseven and one-half acres of ground, upon which six buildings have been\r\nerected, including ore houses and crushing and sampling buildings.\r\nDuring the busy season of summer from thirty-five to forty men are\r\nemployed, who alternate their work in two shifts, day and night. At\r\nthis season it frequently happens that the ore houses, which hold\r\n1,500 tons, are insufficient for the accommodation of the mineral sent\r\nfrom the mines to be crushed, and large quantities have to be stored\r\noutside. In sampling ores from the various mines about Leadville this\r\nestablishment pursues the most careful methods. The different ores are\r\nfirst deposited in large bins holding from 25 to 100 tons. One-tenth\r\nof each load is taken and run through a Dodge crusher, which well\r\nadapts it for the furnaces. A fifth of the tenth already indicated is\r\nput through heavy rollers, and one half of this finely crushed ore is\r\nsubjected to the Bucking hammer and powdered to an eighty-sieve grade.\r\nOne sample of this powder, consisting of a fourth, is given to the\r\nminer, two samples are kept for reference, and the other is sent to\r\nthe assayer, who takes his \"assay ton,\" upon which the company buys\r\nand sells. The capacity of the works are all the way from 80 to 150\r\ntons per day. For samples, $7.50 is charged for silver and lead per\r\nton, and $10 per ton for gold; but in large quantities a less charge\r\nis made. In job crushing, the market value of silver is allowed, with\r\nfrom five to ten per cent. deducted. The Meyer works enjoy an excellent\r\npatronage from the best mines of the camp, including such as the\r\nChrysolite, Carbonate, Vulture, Duncan, Matchless, Climax, Morning\r\nStar, Crescent, and J. D. Dana, some of which have all their crushing\r\ndone at these sampling works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUGUSTUS R.

This will enable Leadville merchants to ship goods through\r\nfrom the East without breaking bulk, and lay them down in their\r\nwarehouses as cheaply as the same commodities could be laid down in\r\nDenver. This will insure Leadville the control of the business of\r\nthe Gunnison country, whose mineral developments are spoken of in the\r\nhighest terms. Propositions from Eastern railroad contractors have\r\nalready been received, preliminary surveys have been made, and\r\n$200,000 guaranteed to the stock subscription. It now seems to be only\r\na question of what method to pursue in constructing the road.\r\n\r\nGrowing out of the broad gauge movement, to some extent, two or three\r\nnarrow gauge enterprises have been organized. One is projected from\r\nLeadville to Salt Lake City, following the carbonate belt, as shown in\r\nHayden's Geological Map, around through the Eagle River, Roaring Fork,\r\nand White River Agency districts, into Utah. Such men as H. A. W.\r\nTabor and C. B. Rustin stand at the head of this project. Another\r\nnarrow gauge road is organized to be built into the \"Ten-Mile\" and\r\nBreckenridge districts, where the famous Robinson Mine is located.\r\nShould the broad gauge be built this summer to Pueblo, there is little\r\ndoubt but that narrow gauges would ramify out from Leadville into\r\nevery mineral bearing gulch that was found accessible.\r\n\r\nW.\r\n\r\nLeadville, May 6, 1880.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\nMr. William B. Hickman, of Sterling, Kan., has patented a swage to be\r\nused in welding the triangular bar which is to form the flange of a\r\nplow point or share to the body of the same.\r\n\r\nMr. Lucius S. Edleblute, of Cincinnati, O., has recently patented what\r\nhe calls the rubber cushioned spoke and hub. This is an improvement\r\nin the class of vehicle wheel hubs having an elastic band or annular\r\nportion which surrounds the journal box and on which the butts of the\r\nspokes rest, so that the wheel is rendered elastic and more durable,\r\nalso comparatively noiseless when running on stony pavements, roads,\r\nor streets.\r\n\r\nMr. George Richards, of Boxbury, Mass., has patented a steam muffler\r\ncomposed of two plates of a diameter very much greater than the\r\ndiameter of the pipe through which the steam escapes from the boiler,\r\nso that the steam has room to expand before escaping to the outer air,\r\nits expansion effectually deadening the noise caused by the passage\r\nthrough the contracted escape pipe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BABY ELEPHANT TAKES A BATH.\r\n\r\nIt is customary with traveling menageries in hot weather when\r\nconvenient to a river to allow the elephants to take a bath. The\r\nLondon Circus passed through Woonsocket, R. I., the other day, when\r\nthe keeper let loose all the elephants, including \"Hebe\" and her baby,\r\nfor the above purpose. The mother and her offspring were permitted to\r\napproach a river for the first time since the baby was born, and they\r\nwere, therefore, watched with great interest by their keeper. The\r\nmother cautiously approached the Blackstone River, which flows past\r\nthe circus grounds, and waded in a short distance, carefully feeling\r\nher way; she then encouraged the baby to follow her, which the\r\nobedient little fellow did. When far enough in the mother caught the\r\nbaby between her fore legs, and then lay down in the water and rolled\r\nover, giving the baby the first bath. The mother then felt perfectly\r\nsatisfied with her job, and rising up approached the bank, bringing\r\nthe little one with her. On reaching terra firma she drove the younger\r\nbefore her, and would not allow it to approach the water again, though\r\nit showed a disposition to do so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYLLIRHOE BUCEPHALA.\r\n\r\nThis little animal belongs to the family of snails, class Heteropoda,\r\nis about an inch long, and is devoid of any shell or covering\r\nwhatever. It is flat, and so absolutely transparent that a person\r\ncan read through its body. It is provided with a pair of feelers. The\r\nlittle animal is very luminous if placed in fresh water or disturbed,\r\nbut this phenomenon is most beautiful when an ammonia solution is\r\npoured over the animal. It will shine with a vivid blue light, which\r\nextinguishes with life. But even after death the nerve cells, which\r\nare directly below the skin and produce the light, can be irritated\r\nsufficiently to become luminous. It is a singular fact that\r\nelectricity has no effect upon these nerve cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHYLLIRHOE BUCEPHALA--AS SEEN IN THE LIGHT.\r\n\r\n_a b_, ganglion; _c_, intestines; _d_, liver; _f_, kidneys; _g_,\r\ngenerative organs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHYLLIRHOE BUCEPHALA--SHOWING IN THE DARK THE LUMINOUS\r\nSPOTS.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF TREES AND SHRUBS.\r\n\r\nIn view of the drought which prevails in many parts of the country and\r\nits unusual severity over extensive districts, the _Rural New Yorker_\r\nsuggests to those who have planted trees or shrubs the past spring\r\nthat there is one method, and so far as we know, says the writer, only\r\none, by which they may be protected against injury or death from that\r\ncause. Surface watering has been shown to do more harm than good. The\r\nground is made hard and compact, thus becoming a better conductor of\r\nheat while it becomes less pervious to air and moisture. A portion of\r\nthe surface soil should be removed, and then pailful after pailful\r\nof water thrown in until the ground, to a depth of two feet and to\r\na width about the stem of not less than three feet in diameter, has\r\nbecome saturated. Then, as soon as the water has disappeared from the\r\nsurface, the removed soil should be well pulverized and returned. A\r\ncovering of boards, straw, or hay, or even of sand or gravel, may then\r\nbe applied, and the tree or shrub, thus treated, will pass through ten\r\ndays of additional drought in safety.\r\n\r\nAs soon as rain comes to wet the earth thoroughly, we think it is\r\nbetter to remove the mulch. Nothing is then gained by permitting it\r\nto remain. Mellowing the surface soil about the trees, thus keeping it\r\nfree from grass and weeds, is then the most that is needed. We would\r\nrepeat that the present is the season when the female borer deposits\r\nher eggs on the stems of fruit trees, and the wash of lime, potash,\r\nsulphur, etc. (darkened with lampblack), should now be applied and\r\nreapplied during June and July, as soon as washed off by rain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORCE OF TREE GROWTH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FORCE OF TREE GROWTH.]\r\n\r\nThe disruptive power of tree roots, growing in the crevices of rocks,\r\nis well known. Masses of stone weighing many tons are often dislodged\r\nin this way from the faces of cliffs, and no one gives them more than\r\na passing glance. When, however, the sanctity of the tomb is\r\ninvaded, despite the graven warning of the occupant, the case is very\r\ndifferent, and superstitious people are apt to think there must be\r\nsomething in it more than accident and the unconscious expression of\r\nthe resistless force of growing vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe engraving herewith is copied from a photograph sent to us by\r\na European correspondent, of a grave in the Garten churchyard, in\r\nHanover, Germany, the invasion of which by a birch tree has been the\r\noccasion of much wonderment by country people, who come from great\r\ndistances to examine it.\r\n\r\nThe monument, so unfeelingly disrupted, was erected in 1782, and bears\r\non its base the following inscription: \"This grave, which was bought\r\nfor all eternity, must never be opened.\" A chance birch seed, lodging\r\nin a crevice of the monument, has displayed the irony of nature in\r\nslowly yet surely thwarting the desire of the person who designed it\r\nfor a perpetual memorial. All the joints are separated, the strong\r\niron clamps are broken, and the birch tree has embraced the upper\r\nlarge block, which weighs about one and a quarter tons, and the\r\ntree is driving its roots below, gradually but surely tilting the\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSEVERANCE WITH THE DROWNED.\r\n\r\nIn a recent communication to the French Academy, Professor Fort\r\nasserts that he was enabled to restore to life a child three years\r\nold, by practicing artificial respiration on it four hours, commencing\r\nthree hours and a half after apparent death. He mentions also a case\r\nin which Dr. Fournol, of Billancourt, reanimated, in July, 1878, an\r\napparently drowned person by four hours of artificial respiration\r\nbegun one hour after the patient was taken from the water. At this\r\nseason, when cases of drowning are apt to be frequent, the possible\r\nbenefit that may come from a persevering effort to revive victims\r\nof drowning, should encourage friends not to despair of their\r\nresuscitation, even after several hours of seemingly fruitless labor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPLE TEST FOR CHLORAL HYDRATE.\r\n\r\nA new test for chloral hydrate has been devised by Frank Ogston,\r\nnamely, yellow sulphide of ammonium. On adding this reagent to a\r\nsolution of chloral of moderate strength there is at first no change\r\nnoticed, but in a short time the colorless solution acquires an orange\r\nyellow color, and on longer standing turns brown and evolves a gas\r\nof very disagreeable odor. Ogston's experiments show that a solution\r\ncontaining ten milligrammes turns brown in six hours, and gives the\r\npeculiar odor. With one milligramme the orange-yellow color appears\r\nin twelve hours, but no odor. Croton chloral gives the same reactions,\r\nbut chloroform, chloric ether, and formic acid do not.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL HISTORY NOTES.\r\n\r\n_The Propagation of Oysters._--At the recent meeting in this city\r\nof the American Fish Cultural Association, a paper was read on the\r\npropagation of the oyster, by Dr. W. J. Brook, of the Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity. The manner in which this propagation takes place had never\r\nbefore, he said, been thoroughly understood. Through studies made by\r\nhim last summer, however, great light was thrown on the subject. He\r\nfound that the American oysters do not breed their young in the\r\nshell, as had been supposed, and that consequently the eggs can be\r\nimpregnated artificially. An average oyster contains from six to nine\r\nmillion eggs, and one of large size may contain fifty millions. The\r\nplan pursued by him in fertilizing these eggs was to chop the male\r\nand female oyster up together; thus the fluids are mixed and the\r\nimpregnation is made complete. The process of development immediately\r\nbegins, and goes on so rapidly that a change may be noted every\r\nfifteen seconds. In a very few hours the embryo is sufficiently formed\r\nto swim in the water. The shells at first are very small, and are not\r\nadjacent to each other. They grow very rapidly, closing down over the\r\nsides, and finally unite and form the hinge. In the short space of\r\ntwenty-four hours the young oyster is able to take food, and from\r\nthree days to a week it attains perfect form. During its early life it\r\nis a swimming animal. The oyster is able to reproduce its species at\r\nthe end of a year's growth, and it is marketable at the age of three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.

His invention was what printers call an\r\n\"upside-down press,\" the type being upside down when in the bed. About\r\ntwenty-five years ago Mr. Ruggles sold out his interest for nearly\r\n$200,000, and since then has not been in active business.

Originality.\r\n2. Invention and discovery.\r\n3. Utility and quality of material.\r\n4. Skill in workmanship.\r\n5. Fitness for purposes intended.\r\n6. Adaptation to public wants.\r\n7. Economy.\r\n8. Cost.\r\n9. Finish and elegance of cases.\r\n10. Time-keeping qualities.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed the judges should use the number 100 as expressing the\r\nhighest degree of excellence in each of these ten elements of inherent\r\nand comparative merit, and adjudge individually to each of the several\r\nexhibits such rating as their respective judgments would warrant after\r\ncareful examination; each set of opinions being made a portion of\r\nthis report, and in the _resume_ the mean average being taken as the\r\nunanimous verdict of the judges.\r\n\r\nIt was also decided we should take up each exhibit in the order\r\noriginally examined, and, beginning with the first element of merit\r\n(originality), each judge should in numbers express his judgment of\r\nthe inherent and comparative merit attaching to each exhibit in this\r\none element; this being done, to proceed with each succeeding element\r\nin order and in the same manner. The five judgments being complete and\r\nin numbers, the aggregated verdict is arrived at simply by addition\r\nand division.\r\n\r\nThis is not only a verdict as to the inherent and comparative merits\r\nof each exhibit, but also a full analysis of each order of merit in\r\nany exhibit as compared with all the others....\r\n\r\nIn giving this verdict it was absolutely necessary to ascertain to the\r\nfullest extent the time-keeping qualities of the exhibits. The judges\r\nwere led to this conclusion from the fact that in some of the\r\nexhibits we were shown watches of equal finish containing every\r\nknown application of horological science in practically the same\r\nconstruction, which should, as far as they could determine by merely\r\noptical examination, keep quite as good time as watches of double and\r\ntreble the costs in other exhibits, thus involving their judgment in\r\ndoubt upon several elements of merit.\r\n\r\nIn justice to themselves and to the exhibitors the judges determined\r\nto make the test in only one position, and give the whole of the time\r\nat their disposal to testing the watches in what might be considered\r\ntheir normal position, if such term is allowable--that is, \"pendent\r\nup,\" or hanging.\r\n\r\nAt the solicitations of the judges Prof. H. C. Russell, Astronomer\r\nRoyal at the Sydney Observatory, kindly consented to make the tests,\r\nand each of the exhibitors was requested to send three watches of his\r\nown selection to the Observatory for this trial.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen by the report of Professor Russell, eight of the\r\nten exhibitors availed themselves of this opportunity. It is proper,\r\nhowever, to state here that none of the exhibitors apparently\r\nanticipated this test, and that it is possible some of the watches\r\nmight have made a better record if they had been differently attended\r\nto since the opening of the Exhibition; but they were in this respect\r\nall upon a par.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the watches had been made for exhibition purposes and\r\nspecially prepared to that end; and some had been previously rated at\r\nobservatories before sending.\r\n\r\n_Notably, however, to the contrary of the above, the exhibit of the\r\nAmerican Watch Company was the ordinary and regular product of the\r\nfactory, such as is finished every day._\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the possibility that these exhibits might have been\r\nbetter prepared for observatory time tests, some of the exhibits, as\r\nwill be seen by the rating, demonstrate the wonderful advances made in\r\nthe application of horological sciences to the manufacture of watches,\r\nand that their rating is being made equal to that of the best marine\r\nchronometers.\r\n\r\nThe following is the report of Professor Russell, and the accompanying\r\ndiagram (see next page) will readily give an idea of the comparative\r\nperformance of the different watches.\r\n\r\n\"_Sydney Observatory, 26th February, 1880_.\r\n\r\n\"GREGORY P.

Audemars.\r\n\r\n\"And on 18th February:\r\n\r\n\"Two watches, Nos. 2724, 3528, from Mr. Jacob, as agent for\r\nCastleberg.\r\n\r\n\"On the 17th I began rating these watches, keeping them all in one\r\nposition (hanging), and subject to the same conditions of temperature;\r\nin fact, they were all hung on one board, and kept in a compartment\r\nlocked up so as to avoid change of temperature, except such changes as\r\nwere due to changes in the weather.\r\n\r\n\"They were rated once a day by the standard clock, which affords\r\nspecial convenience for this work, and the error of which was found by\r\ndaily astronomical observations giving the absolute time; great care\r\nwas taken in rating so as to get the exact error of each watch every\r\nday, care being taken at the same time to avoid errors in the seconds\r\ndials, a fault sufficiently obvious in some of these exhibits.\r\n\r\n\"In presenting the result of this test in the form of a diagram (see\r\ndiagram on the opposite page), it is necessary to explain that the\r\ncurves show only the change of rate in each case, and nothing is shown\r\nhere of the actual rate, which was large in several instances.\r\n\r\n\"In the diagram spaces between faint lines represent seconds; and the\r\nthicker faint lines represent the mean rate in each case: When the\r\ncurve rises it shows that the watch was gaining on its previous rate,\r\nand when it falls the watch was losing on its previous rate. For\r\nexample, in No. 4 curve the thicker line shows the position of a\r\ngaining rate of 3 sec. per day; on the 18th, watch No. 4 had a gaining\r\nrate of 2.7 sec., and is plotted below the thick line; on the 19th and\r\n20th it was less than 3 sec., but on the 21st the rate increased\r\nto 4.8 sec., and the curve rises above the line. The same rule is\r\nfollowed with losing rates; and, therefore, each curve shows whether\r\nthe watch was gaining or losing on its own rate.\r\n\r\n\"For convenient reference the barometer and temperature curves are\r\nplotted on the same sheet; although from the short time at command the\r\nwatches could only be tested in one position, a glance at the diagram\r\nwill show that in some degree at least the temperature adjustment and\r\nthe isochronal properties of the balance springs were also tested; and\r\nI wish to call your attention to the fact that the whole of these\r\nshow in a more or less degree a marked response to the change in\r\ntemperature, some being over and others under corrected.\r\n\r\n\"This fact is important, because it adds another proof that the old\r\nform of compensation balance--even when combined with chronometer\r\nspring and escapement and all the refinements which the best modern\r\nworkman can add to it--fails to yield a complete correction for\r\ntemperature; and I much regret that the American Watch Company, who\r\nclaim to have overcome this fault by means of a balance involving a\r\nnew arrangement of the metals, did not send to be tested any of their\r\nfirst-class watches containing this important improvement.\r\n\r\n\"Several of the rate curves, especially Nos. 4, 10, 13, 16, 21, and\r\n24, respond to the change in the barometer in a way that shows the\r\nisochronal properties of their balance springs are not quite perfect.\r\n_Looking down the curves it becomes at once evident that watch No. 5,\r\nwhich is No. 670068, second grade of the American Watch Company, is\r\nremarkably free from these defects, and presents the best rate of\r\nall the watches tested._ No. 9, which is No. 2526, Kullberg, is the\r\nnearest approach to No. 5; indeed, the difference between its highest\r\nand lowest rates is 0.1 sec. less than No. 5, but it has not such a\r\nsteady rate. The timekeeping of both these watches is remarkably good,\r\nand shows that we have entered upon a new era in the manufacture of\r\npocket chronometers; _for these rates are better than the majority of\r\nmarine chronometers._\r\n\r\n\"_Among the cheaper watches tested, No. 6, which is No. 1221336, of\r\nthe American Watch Company, is worthy of notice; it is a watch of the\r\nsixth grade, yet its performance has been better than that of many\r\nvery expensive and otherwise first-class watches among those tested;\r\nsuch a watch speaks volumes in favor of the system under which it was\r\nmade, and is the best comment upon the accuracy of the machines that\r\nproduced it._\r\n\r\n\"There are several watches among those tested which have kept\r\nwonderfully steady rates, but their comparative merit is shown in the\r\ndiagrams much better than it could be by any description. The daily\r\nrate of each watch will be found in a table attached.\r\n\r\n\"The changes in Nos. 1, 2, 3, 17, and 19 were too great to plot.\r\n\r\n\"H. C.

S. A.,\r\n\r\na first-class award, and such other special distinction, diploma,\r\nmedal, or award, as is consistent with the duties and obligations of\r\nthe honorable Sydney International Commission, for the largest and\r\nmost complete exhibit of horological instruments examined.\r\n\r\nThey also propose, as the only means by which their appreciation of\r\nthe merits of the production of this company can be adequately or\r\nequitably recognized by the Committee on Judging and Awards, that a\r\nseparate first-class award be given for the timekeeping qualities of\r\nall grades of these watches.\r\n\r\nAlso a separate first-class award for the perfection of this system of\r\nwatchmaking and the improvements in the mechanical parts of the watch,\r\nbeing notably in the main spring and going barrel, the patent safety\r\npinion, the perfect epicycloidal form of all the teeth of the train,\r\nin every grade of watch alike, and the isochronal adjustment of the\r\nbalance spring.\r\n\r\nAlso to Charles V. Woerd, mechanical superintendent of the American\r\nWatch Company, Waltham, Mass., U. S. A., a first-class award for his\r\nnew mode of compensating balances.\r\n\r\nAlso a separate first-class award for the improvements in cases, the\r\nnumber of artistic forms and designs used, the beauty and elegance\r\nof their finish, and for their new and indestructible method of\r\nenameling.\r\n\r\nVICTOR KULLBERG\r\n\r\nThe display of marine chronometers by this maker, with the Observatory\r\nratings, was of the very first order. Every part of those instruments\r\nwas remarkably well made, and the modifications of some of the balance\r\nwheels worthy of special attention. Adjudged a first-class award.\r\n\r\nThe display of watches by the same maker, although small, commanded\r\nattention from their very nice finish in all parts. As will be seen\r\nfrom the report and diagram of Professor Russell, they are good\r\ntimekeepers, especially the one having the chronometer escapement.\r\nThis style of watch, however, is of too delicate construction and too\r\ncostly to fully meet the requirements of any considerable public want.\r\nThe same objection will hold good as to the lever escapements as far\r\nas cost or economy is concerned, they being comparatively too high\r\npriced. Representing a certain class of manufacture, they are of the\r\nfirst order of merit, and adjudged a first-class award.\r\n\r\nThe \"gas governor\" exhibited by the same maker, an instrument for\r\nregulating the amount of heat in the testing of chronometers, is\r\ncommended as a useful invention.\r\n\r\n[Continued on page 10.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESUME OF THE JURY'S EXAMINATION [page 9]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n+--------------+--------+---------+--------+-------+--------+\r\n|              |AMERICAN|         |        |       |        |\r\n|   NAMES      | WATCH  |         |        |  Thos.| Castle-|\r\n|    OF        |COMPANY,| Victor  |Nicole &|Russell| berg & |\r\n| EXHIBITORS.  |WALTHAM.|Kullberg.|Nielsen.|& Sons.|Company.|\r\n+--------------+--------+---------+--------+-------+--------+\r\n|Originality.  |   98   |    0    |   28   |   8   |    0   |\r\n+--------------+--------+---------+--------+-------+--------+\r\n|Invention &   |   95   |    0    |   22   |   0   |    0   |\r\n| discovery.   |        |         |        |       |        |\r\n+--------------+--------+---------+--------+-------+--------+\r\n|Utility and   |        |         |        |       |        |\r\n|quality of    |   95   |   73    |   47   |  25   |   29   |\r\n|material.     |        |         |        |       |        |\r\n+--------------+--------+---------+--------+-------+--------+\r\n|Skill in      |   93   |   80    |   58   |  30   |   30   |\r\n|workmanship.  |        |         |        |       |        |\r\n+--------------+--------+---------+--------+-------+--------+\r\n|Fitness for   |        |         |        |       |        |\r\n|purposes      |  100   |   89    |   70   |  36   |   36   |\r\n|intended.     |        |         |        |       |        |\r\n+--------------+--------+---------+--------+-------+--------+\r\n|Adaptation to |  100   |   53    |   60   |  34   |   41   |\r\n|public wants. |        |         |        |       |        |\r\n+--------------+--------+---------+--------+-------+--------+\r\n|Economy.      |  100   |   57    |   48   |  22   |   25   |\r\n+--------------+--------+---------+--------+-------+--------+\r\n|Cost.         |  100   |   65    |   38   |  26   |   32   |\r\n+--------------+--------+---------+--------+-------+--------+\r\n|Finish and    |        |         |        |       |        |\r\n|elegance      |  100   |   73    |   76   |  42   |   42   |\r\n|of cases.     |        |         |        |       |        |\r\n+--------------+--------+---------+--------+-------+--------+\r\n|Timekeeping   |  100   |   96    |   80   |  44   |   53   |\r\n|qualities.    |        |         |        |       |        |\r\n+--------------+--------+---------+--------+-------+--------+\r\n|              |        |         |        |       |        |\r\n|Totals        | 981    |  586    |  527   |  267  |  288   |\r\n|              |        |         |        |       |        |\r\n+--------------+--------+---------+--------+-------+--------+\r\n\r\n[_Cont._]\r\n+--------------+--------+-------+---------+--------+--------+\r\n|              |        |       |         |        | Inter- |\r\n|   NAMES      |        |       |         |        |national|\r\n|    OF        |S.

[page 10]\r\n\r\n[_Continued from page 8._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNICOLE & NIELSEN.\r\n\r\nThis exhibit, made specially for the Exhibition, comprised a full line\r\nof plain levers, split seconds, chronographs, calendars, repeaters,\r\netc., and was a representative display of their peculiar style of\r\nmanufacture in all its details. The cost of these watches, compared\r\nwith others of similar construction and finish, was excessive; and\r\nwhile they show good timekeeping qualities, they do not equal that of\r\nother exhibits.\r\n\r\nAs representing their own methods of construction they are of the\r\nfirst order of merit, and are adjudged a first-class award.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOS. RUSSELL & SONS\r\n\r\nexhibit a full line of their manufacture, which, upon comparison with\r\nother exhibits of the same general character and construction, places\r\nthem in the third order of merit, and they are adjudged a third-class\r\naward.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. BACKSCHMID\r\n\r\nexhibits a class of cheap watches of very inferior workmanship and\r\nfinish, of the last order of merit, and adjudged a fourth-class award.\r\n\r\n\r\nN. CASTLEBERG & CO.\r\n\r\nexhibit a meritorious line of watches in many respects, of good\r\nfinish, and not excessively high priced for their performances; of the\r\nsecond order of merit, and adjudged a second class award.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LANGE & SONS\r\n\r\nexhibit a class of watches possessing many elements of merit, and\r\nof superior finish in many respects and at a cost which is quite\r\nreasonable. That the watches are constructed upon scientific\r\nprinciples and are intended as reliable timepieces, is shown from\r\nObservatory tests. The variations show that care has been taken to\r\napproximate a perfect adjustment, and that a partial success has\r\nbeen attained. A peculiarity in the construction of the balance\r\nwheel--having a horizontal split from the timing second holes each\r\nway--is noticeable, which we fail to understand. This exhibit was made\r\nexpressly for this Exhibition, and Observatory rates sent with each\r\nwatch, and, as a representative exhibit, although small, was the\r\nsecond best examined, and is, in its class, of the first order of\r\nmerit, and adjudged a first-class award.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUIS AUDEMARS\r\n\r\nexhibits a wonderful class of complicated watches, calendars,\r\nrepeaters, chronographs, etc., etc., combined in one watch, and\r\nelaborately cased and artistically finished. The great element of\r\nmerit in this exhibit is in the combination of the great number\r\nof unusual functions for a watch, and by skill in workmanship and\r\nmechanical science securing a correct performance.\r\n\r\nThe enormous cost of these watches is an effectual embargo on their\r\nuse to any except the very few, and their utility is, therefore,\r\nvery limited. In their class they are, however, of the first order of\r\nmerit, and adjudged a first-class award.\r\n\r\n\r\nG. TRIBANDEAU\r\n\r\nexhibits a considerable collection of watches in a great variety of\r\ncases, of a class of workmanship, finish, and performance calling for\r\nthe fourth order of merit, and are adjudged a fourth-class award.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. H. RODANET\r\n\r\nexhibits two marine chronometers only, one of which was broken and the\r\nother out of order; commended.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL WATCH COMPANY\r\n\r\nexhibit a collection of watches of the third order of merit, and\r\nadjudged a third-class award.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this report, the judges very much regret the limitation\r\nin time which has prevented them securing position tests of this very\r\ninteresting exhibit in horology, as much on account of the exhibitors\r\nas on their own account. Such advances have in the last few years been\r\nmade in this science that, in the interest of the public as well as of\r\nthe manufacturers, a sufficiency of time is desirable to make tests\r\nin five or six positions, and fourteen days should be allowed to each\r\nposition. Tests for heat and cold, and an opportunity to carefully\r\nnote barometric and thermometric influences upon the various systems\r\nof adjustment, would be very valuable and interesting.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, etc.,\r\n\r\nGREGORY P.

Corn files and pencils are getting\r\nstale, and an enterprising inhabitant of Dresden has lately brought\r\nout what he calls a \"corn magnet.\" It is evident that it is as unlike\r\na magnet as possible, for an examination shows that it is made of\r\nsulphur colored with graphite. The directions are to set fire to\r\none end, and let a drop of the melted sulphur fall upon the corn. A\r\nconvenient and agreeable operation, especially if the corn is on\r\nthe bottom of the foot. It is needless to say that the corn usually\r\nsurvives the slight burn and lives to torment the owner again. All\r\nburns, whether by caustic or otherwise, should be avoided.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS ON THE RESISTANCE OF MATERIALS.\r\n\r\nProf. J. Burkitt Webb, C.E., now in Europe, writes as follows:\r\n\r\nOn the invitation of Prof. Spangenberg we visited the\r\n\"Versuchsstation,\" at the Gewerbe-Akademie, where the important\r\nexperiments upon materials for engineering purposes are being made.\r\nThese tests are of two kinds--trials of strength and trials of\r\nendurance. The first are made by means of very heavy and accurate\r\nmachinery, mostly new within the last two or three years; the latter\r\nare the celebrated \"Dauer-Versuche,\" a description of which we will\r\nreserve for another letter.\r\n\r\nThe main machine, of which there are three or four duplicates at work\r\nat various points in Germany, is housed in a special building in the\r\ninterior court of the academy. It consists of heavy iron \"ways,\" some\r\nfifty feet long, accurately planed and secured to a stone foundation,\r\nwith a hydraulic pump and scales at one end, and a number of massive\r\nattachments for subjecting the piece of iron or other material to\r\nvarious kinds of strains. There are also other instruments which\r\nbelong to the machine as delicate as it is heavy, and which are used\r\nfor adjusting the parts of the apparatus, reading the results of a\r\ntest, or making calculations. This machine differs from others in the\r\nway of measuring the force used. It has been the custom to take\r\nthe pressure on the liquid in the hydraulic cylinder, as shown by a\r\nmanometer, as the basis of calculation. This introduces an inaccuracy,\r\nas part of this is due to the friction on the piston packing, and the\r\ntrue pressure is less than that shown by this irregular quantity.\r\nTo avoid this difficulty a massive lever is introduced between the\r\nhydraulic press and the point where its pressure is applied. One arm\r\nof this lever is one-eighth inch long, and the other five hundred\r\ntimes as long, so that to measure a pressure of one hundred tons, four\r\nhundred pounds must be placed on the scale pan which hangs from\r\nthe end of the long end of the lever. The fulcrum rests against the\r\npiston, and the short end of the lever is connected by heavy\r\nlinks with the apparatus by means of which the strain is applied.\r\nTechnically speaking the fulcra of scales are \"knife edges,\" but to\r\nconvey a pressure of one hundred tons and remain free to move, these\r\nedges must be very obtuse, perhaps 160 deg. to 170 deg.; they must be as\r\nlong as possible, some fifteen inches, of the best hardened steel,\r\naccurately ground, and must rest against a hardened plate of steel.\r\nMade with the greatest care the sharp edge under such a pressure will\r\nsometimes make a dent in the plate and the scales are clogged. As\r\nit is very difficult to measure the one-eighth inch with accuracy,\r\nanother lever is provided with a ratio of one to ten, and with a\r\nshort arm long enough to be made of a certain length with but a small\r\npercentage of error. To test the main lever this occupies essentially\r\nthe same place as a sample of iron to be stretched; it is loaded with,\r\nsay, two hundred pounds, which it multiplies to a ton; this pressure\r\nis then weighed by placing four pounds upon the main scale pan,\r\nand the fulcrum of the main lever is adjusted until the two weights\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nThe attachments consist of: I. Jaws for holding round, square, and\r\nflat bars to be submitted to tension. II. Arrangements for holding\r\nbeams and columns in various ways at their ends, and compressing them\r\nuntil they are crushed or \"buckle.\" III. Two massive graduated iron\r\nbeams, which are placed crosswise on the \"ways,\" and used for twisting\r\nshafts, railroad axles, etc. IV. A face plate, about four feet square,\r\nfor holding plates of boiler iron nearly as large by the perimeter,\r\nand crushing in the middle by forcing various shaped pieces against\r\nit. V. Apparatus for bending a beam by crushing an angular piece into\r\nit; and in the same connection, VI. Shears for cutting off bars of\r\nmetal and measuring the force required.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this main machine were some, quite old, which had\r\nbeen used in the infancy of the subject by a former professor, and a\r\nnew special machine for the same purpose as attachment V., and which\r\nseemed to \"kink\" a piece of railroad iron as if it were only lead. In\r\nthis the pressure was obtained by screws.\r\n\r\nAmong the instruments used for the adjustment of the parts of the\r\nmain machine we saw the finest cathetometer we had ever seen. This\r\ninstrument, by Breithaupt, in Cassel, has two telescopes, with\r\nmicrometer screws with more than one hundred and twenty-five threads\r\nper inch, and scales graduated on glass with more than six hundred and\r\ntwenty five divisions to the inch. Another instrument for measuring\r\nthe deflection, in two directions at once, of a column under pressure,\r\nhas micrometer screws with more than two hundred and fifty threads per\r\ninch. We saw also a planimeter, which not only calculated mechanically\r\nthe area of a figure, but gave also its center of gravity, moment\r\nof inertia, etc. We saw also a French calculating machine; the other\r\napparatus is, we believe, all German. If one is, however, critical, it\r\nwill be found in many lines of business that all the fine goods here\r\nare imported, though naturally the Germans are slow to acknowledge it.\r\n\r\nWe witnessed the experiments on a sample of round iron over an inch\r\nin diameter, and on a piece of iron plate three inches wide by half an\r\ninch thick. It is perhaps needless to say that they seemed to stretch\r\nlike putty and to break like thread. The pressure is put on a few\r\nhundred pounds at a time, and the elongation is read by two telescopes\r\nand a scale, which multiply the distance five hundred times. At the\r\nsame time the first \"elastic limit\" is watched for. Before this is\r\narrived at the piece will return to its original length when the\r\ntension is removed; after this the stretching is in part permanent.\r\nOne of the facts brought out is that there are _several_ elastic\r\nlimits, in copper seven or eight. The appearance of the surface after\r\nthe elastic limit is passed and the iron stretches is peculiar. A wavy\r\nappearance is seen, and longitudinal ridges begin to form, due to the\r\nchanges going on in the crystals, by which they adapt themselves to\r\nthe increased length. After a further general adaptation of structure\r\nbecomes impossible, these appearances culminate in the weakest part.\r\nThe apparatus for measuring the increase in length has long since been\r\nremoved, and the places where it was attached have been filed smooth\r\nto avoid introducing the weak point artificially. The diameter of this\r\npart now reduces rapidly, and the surface becomes rough and the iron\r\nhot--you can see it stretch. When it has reduced twenty-five or more\r\nper cent. it gives way suddenly with a sharp crack. The percentage of\r\nreduction before breaking is now recorded with the observations on the\r\nelasticity and the breaking strain, and the experiment is at an end.\r\nIt suggested itself to see if the work done in pulling the iron\r\napart was fully accounted for by the heat generated. We could easily\r\ncalculate the work up to the point of maximum tension, but after this\r\nthe force required was not measured; however, a rough calculation\r\nshowed that the iron was as hot as required, or at least that the data\r\nwould require to be quite complete if any residual was to be found.\r\n\r\nBerlin, May 13, 1880.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINEERING INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\nAn improved wheel guard, which will push any obstacles on the track\r\naside, and which can be adjusted to a greater or less height above the\r\nrails, has been patented by Mr. Solomon Brisac, of New York city.\r\nIt consists in a wheel guard formed of a metallic box with a beveled\r\nfront side, which box is adjustably fastened to the front end of a\r\nrecessed plate resting on and partially surrounding the grease box.\r\nThe box is braced by means of a rod attached to its forward end and\r\npassing into a socket fastened to the bottom of the car.\r\n\r\nAn improved water motor, constructed on the general principle of a\r\nrotary engine, in which two compartments are arranged side by side,\r\nwith a partition intervening, and in which the sliding pistons in the\r\npiston wheels in the two compartments are arranged at right angles\r\nto each other, has been patented by Mr. William E.

The Baxter steamers were not sufficiently remunerative\r\nto continue the building of that kind of boat. They do not carry a\r\nsufficient load, owing to their build, and that is made necessary by\r\nthe form and arrangement of the machinery and propelling power, the\r\npropeller being that form used by the tug in Buffalo. The new style,\r\nwhich bids to pay handsomely, is as full a bow and stern as the\r\nordinary first-class canal boat. The propelling power is radically\r\ndifferent from the tug propeller. The wheel is eight feet in diameter\r\nand placed close to the stern; the boiler is upright, with a single\r\nengine, very compact machinery, taking up no more room than the stable\r\nin many boats, and enabling the boat to carry 7,500 bushels of corn\r\nand coal for the trip. With this cargo they run from Buffalo to New\r\nYork in seven days on five and a half gross tons of coal, saving river\r\nand harbor towing. One returned from New York to Buffalo in one hour\r\nless than seven days, bringing one hundred and thirty tons of freight.\r\nThe outlook now promises to supersede mule and horse towing. The\r\nBelgian system of cable towing will take that large number of boats\r\nnow relying on the mule, and deliver them promptly as consigned and in\r\nmuch less time and cost than can be done by the mule. Both systems are\r\nnecessary for rapid movement on the canal, and to cheapen the transfer\r\nfrom the West to the seaboard. Steam is sure to supersede animal power\r\non the canal, as everywhere else. The canal steamboats are at last so\r\nfar perfected as to insure a handsome profit in running them, and\r\na large number will soon be at work on the canal. Two are to be\r\nconstructed in Lockport as speedily as possible by one of our most\r\nenterprising boat builders, and the machinery is contracted for,\r\nthus opening up a new industry for our numerous and worthy\r\nmechanics.--_Lockport_ (_N.

M.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITIONS OF PLANETS FOR JULY, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY.\r\n\r\nOn July 1 Mercury sets a few minutes after 9 in the evening.\r\n\r\nMercury can be readily found, early in July, a few degrees south of\r\nthe point of sunset; the planet moves rapidly southward, but can be\r\nfollowed, and may be seen as late as the 20th. On July 18 Mercury has\r\nnearly the declination of Regulus.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENUS.\r\n\r\nVenus keeps nearly the path of the sun, setting after the sun late in\r\nJuly, but so nearly with it that the planet is not likely to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARS.\r\n\r\nMars has moved from its position nearly in line with Castor and Pollux\r\ntoward Leo. It sets on July 1 at 9h. 44m. P.M. On the 31st Mars sets\r\nat 8h. 32m.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st, at meridian passage, Mars and Uranus are nearly together.\r\nUranus is east of Mars and half a degree south.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUPITER.\r\n\r\nJupiter is coming into the evening hours.\r\n\r\nOn July 1 Jupiter rises a few minutes after midnight. On July 31\r\nJupiter rises a few minutes after 10 P.M. It will be known at once by\r\nits brilliancy.\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary belts of Jupiter the planet still shows at this\r\ntime (June 10) the large ruddy spot spoken of by many persons some\r\nweeks since. This spot is elliptical in shape; its longest diameter is\r\nabout one-fifth that of Jupiter. A small glass will show it, and the\r\nordinary observer can, by watching its appearance and disappearance\r\nand reappearance, determine the time of rotation of Jupiter on its\r\naxis, or the length of the planet's day.\r\n\r\nThe best evenings for looking at Jupiter are those of July 23, when\r\nthe satellite nearest to Jupiter goes across its face, preceded by\r\nits shadow; July 28, when the first and second satellites will make\r\nsimilar transits; and July 29, when Jupiter will rise without the\r\npresence of its third satellite, which will be in eclipse, and will\r\ncome out of the shadow after midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURN.\r\n\r\nSaturn follows close upon Jupiter, but keeps further north in\r\ndeclination by about 21/2 deg..\r\n\r\nOn July 1 Saturn rises 36m. after midnight. On the 31st Saturn rises\r\nat 10h. 38m. P.M.\r\n\r\nThe waning moon will pass north of Jupiter and Saturn on the 27th to\r\n28th.\r\n\r\nAny one who has a glass sufficient to show the ring of Saturn and the\r\nlargest satellite, Titan, will find this planet intensely interesting,\r\nand the movements of the satellite will show the time of its\r\nrevolution in its orbit around Saturn.\r\n\r\n\r\nURANUS.\r\n\r\nUranus rises after the sun, and sets too nearly with the sun to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEPTUNE.\r\n\r\nNeptune may be seen, with a good telescope, in the early morning hour.\r\nNeptune is 21/4 deg. west of Alpha Ceti, and 11 deg. north. It approaches Alpha\r\nCeti during the month, and if it can be found, may be known to be a\r\nplanet by that movement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRES IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Board of Fire Commissioners, just printed, shows\r\nthat during the year 1879 there were in this city 1,551 fires, of\r\nwhich 1,029 were discovered by persons not connected with the Fire\r\nor Police Department. In 1,456 cases the fires were confined to the\r\nbuildings in which they originated. Twenty-five buildings were totally\r\ndestroyed, and 69 were greatly damaged. Of all the fires, 1,001 were\r\nextinguished by buckets of water and fire extinguishers. The total\r\nestimated loss by fire during the year was $900,280 on buildings\r\nand $4,771,300 on stock, making a total of $5,671,580. The\r\nestimated insurances on the buildings were $7,276,446, and on stock,\r\n$14,525,264, making a total of $21,801,710. The estimated uninsured\r\nloss was $180,060. In three cases the loss was between $100,000 and\r\n$115,000; in one case $168,908; in one case $352,185; in one case\r\n$333,900; and in one case $1,978,991. In 1,066 cases the loss was less\r\nthan $100.\r\n\r\nNearly a quarter of all the fires were caused by carelessness, and 100\r\nare attributed to children playing with matches and fire. Forty fires\r\nwere caused by the spontaneous combustion of oily rags and other\r\nmaterials, and 93 by exploding kerosene lamps. Four members of the\r\ndepartment and 12 citizens died of injuries received at fires during\r\nthe year, and 139 firemen and 54 citizens were more or less injured.\r\n\r\nThere are 729 uniformed members of the department The pay roll of the\r\nwhole department for 1879 was $1,030,822.14, and the appropriation for\r\nall expenses was $1,254,970. The appropriation for the present year\r\nis $1,307,670. The department now possesses 233 horses, 1 marine steam\r\nfire engine, 58 steam fire engines, of which 5 are self propelling,\r\n10 chemical engines, 24 hook and ladder trucks, 108 chemical fire\r\nextinguishers, and 4 aerial ladders, together with other fire\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nThe annual inspection of the department showed that the quickest\r\naverage time in hitching a team was 3.17 seconds, and in hitching\r\na single horse, 5.66 seconds. The general average in hitching all\r\napparatus was, in 1879, 9.54 seconds; in 1878, 10.26 seconds; and in\r\n1877, 13.03 seconds.\r\n\r\nDuring the year, $30,300 was collected for licenses for the sale of\r\nkerosene oil, each license costing $10. The Fire Department Relief\r\nFund now amounts to $422,569.07, and the insurance fund to $12,780.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPIRATOR AND COMPRESSOR.\r\n\r\nProfessor Marangoni, of Pavia, has invented an aspirator for measuring\r\ngases which is much simpler than many now in use in laboratories,\r\nwhich latter have the defect that the air or gas ascends through\r\nthe descending liquid and makes thus the measuring of the former\r\nuncertain. The improved apparatus is shown in our illustration. It\r\nconsists of two vessels attached to a fixed horizontal shaft, FE,\r\nwhich is placed upon two upright supports. This shaft has several ways\r\nor passages made in it which performs the functions of the taps.\r\nThe water of the upper receptacle passes into the lower one by the\r\npassage, A, and thence through the tube, BC, issuing at its lowest\r\nextremity at C. The air contained in the lower vessel is thus emitted\r\nby the channel DE, cut into the shaft, while the air or gas is\r\naspirated in the same ratio by the passage and tube, FG. The apparatus\r\nacts thus at the same time as aspirator and compressor. It is simple,\r\nand will be a useful addition to the laboratory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW PHOTOGLYPTIC PROCESS.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A communication to the Photographic Society of France.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWALTER B. WOODBURY.\r\n\r\nIt is now thirteen years since I had the honor of introducing in\r\nFrance my new photoglyptic process, which, up to the present time, has\r\nremained in the hands of very few, owing to the great expense hitherto\r\nnecessary to start the working of it. For some time I have been\r\nengaged in making experiments with a view to discover a system which\r\nshould be at the same time simple and inexpensive; and the process\r\nwhich I have this evening the honor to bring before your notice is the\r\nresult of my researches.\r\n\r\nThe summary of the new system is as follows:\r\n\r\nTo obtain from negatives reliefs on glass similar to transparencies by\r\nthe carbon process, but modified in the quantity of materials used.\r\n\r\nTo attach, and keep in absolute contact with the relief so obtained, a\r\nsheet of tin foil.\r\n\r\nTo solidify this sheet of tinfoil by coating it with copper; then\r\nbacking it up with another sheet of plate glass covered with a\r\ncomposition; and then to detach the whole from the first relief--the\r\nresult being a mould ready to place in the press and print one\r\nthousand or more proofs.\r\n\r\nI commence by showing you the relief made from the negative, and\r\nexplaining how this is obtained.\r\n\r\nI take a sheet of plate glass of a convenient size, and place it in\r\nhot water, together with a sheet of paper a little smaller; then,\r\nhaving driven out the excess of water by means of a squeegee, I\r\nplace it on a leveling stand. Having prepared a solution composed of\r\ngelatine 200 parts, water 1,000 parts, glycerine 20 parts, white sugar\r\n30 parts, with a little Indian ink, and filtered the same, I pour a\r\nsufficient quantity on the paper and spread it up to the corners with\r\nthe finger. These plates are then dried in a dry place and can be kept\r\nuntil wanted.\r\n\r\nTo sensitize the plates I employ a bath of bichromate of potash of\r\nsix per cent., and again dry them. Without doubt this method is rather\r\nlong; but one should consider that each proof made is capable of\r\ngiving five or ten thousand prints if necessary, as the same relief\r\nwill make many printing moulds. I tried, with the aid of the Autotype\r\nCompany, of London, to get a suitable tissue; but as this requires\r\na uniform thickness of half a millimeter the ordinary system did not\r\nsucceed. When the sensitized plate is dry the edges are cut with a\r\nknife, the glasses serving over and over again. I show you a piece of\r\nthis prepared paper.\r\n\r\nAs in the carbon process, it is necessary to place a border of black\r\npaper at the back of the negative, and to cut the sensitized tissue a\r\nlittle larger than the opening.\r\n\r\nAfter the exposure the gelatine is fixed on a collodionized glass by\r\nplacing them both in water and squeegeeing the surface; but in dry\r\nweather it is as well to use albumen in place of collodion, as used\r\nby M. Ferrier for his transparencies in carbon. The glass holding the\r\ngelatine is now placed in a hot water bath heated to 42 deg. Centigrade,\r\nand left till the paper comes away from the gelatine, when it is\r\nplaced in this apparatus by the frame holding the grooves.\r\n\r\nBy means of this small gas regulator the temperature is kept always\r\nthe same, namely, 50 deg. Centigrade. The water should be now and then\r\nagitated by lifting up and down the frame holding the glasses.\r\n\r\nAfter a space of three or four hours the reliefs will be sufficiently\r\nwashed, and can be taken out and placed in alcohol to dry quickly\r\nand sharp at the same time. In this stage of the process all spots or\r\nscratches that may have been on the negative can be removed (being in\r\nrelief on the gelatine) by means of a piece of glass. The relief is\r\nnow ready to be covered with the tin. You will observe that up to the\r\npresent the operations have been almost the same as those necessary to\r\nproduce a transparency in carbon.\r\n\r\nAs it is of the first necessity that the tin should be kept in\r\nabsolute contact with the gelatine relief, I prepare the latter by\r\nrubbing it over with a piece of flannel charged with a greasy matter\r\n(pomatum answers as well as anything). I then make a border of\r\nIndia-rubber in benzine round the glass. The effect of this is to\r\nprevent any air from returning between the tin and the relief when\r\nonce it has been driven out.\r\n\r\nTaking care that the back of the glass is perfectly clean, it is now\r\nplaced on the steel or glass bed of a rolling-press. A sheet of tin\r\nfoil (without holes) that has been smoothed on a sheet of glass by a\r\nsoft brush is now laid on it, and then three or four thicknesses of\r\nblotting paper. The whole is then passed under the cylinder several\r\ntimes, each time increasing the pressure. The surface of the tin\r\nis now ready to place in the electrotyping cell, but must first be\r\ncleaned with a solution of caustic potash to remove any grease, and\r\nbordered with shellac varnish to prevent the copper from depositing\r\nwhere not required.\r\n\r\nElectric contact is made by means of the small apparatus, on removing\r\na small proportion of the lac varnish. After two or three hours\r\nsufficient copper will have been deposited, and after drying can be\r\nthen attached to another glass, on which it will remain.\r\n\r\nThis glass is covered while hot with a composition of shellac, resin,\r\nand Venice turpentine, and can be prepared in advance, using an iron\r\nplate heated direct by the gas flame. The same iron plate is employed\r\nto again soften the composition and attach it to the copper; but this\r\ntime heated only by boiling water, this temperature being sufficient\r\nto soften it until it enters into all the hollows of the copper. On\r\nplacing a weight on the two glasses the excess of the composition is\r\nforced out at the edges. When cold the glass plate on which the copper\r\nand tin are now attached can be separated from the relief, which can\r\nthen be used over and over again to produce fresh matrices.\r\n\r\nThe matrix or intaglio is now ready to place in the printing press,\r\nand the remaining operations of printing are exactly the same as those\r\nused in the old process of photoglyptic printing.\r\n\r\nIn placing the mould in the press it is advisable to place one or\r\ntwo thicknesses of stout blotting paper, previously wetted, under the\r\nmould to give to it a slight amount of elasticity and, at the same\r\ntime, to keep it in place.\r\n\r\nAs in all other mechanical processes a reversed or pellicle negative\r\nis required; but it is very simple to print upon a specially prepared\r\ntransfer paper, and, instead of mounting the print with the face\r\nuppermost, to attach it under water to the mount, and when dry to\r\ndetach the paper on which the print has been made. By this means there\r\nremains only one thickness of paper instead of two, thus doing away\r\nwith an objection which has often been found in mounted photographs\r\nfor book illustration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\nAn improved combined cutting and clinching tool has been patented by\r\nMr. Peter D.

The facilities of business and\r\nsteam communication are such that patents can be obtained\r\nabroad by our citizens almost as easily as at\r\nhome. The expense to apply for an English patent is\r\n$75; German, $100; French, $100; Belgian, $100; Canadian, $50.\r\n\r\n_Copies of Patents_.--Persons desiring any patent\r\nissued from 1836 to November 20, 1866, can be supplied\r\nwith official copies at reasonable cost, the price depending\r\nupon the extent of drawings and length of\r\nspecifications.\r\n\r\nAny patent issued since November 20, 1866, at which\r\ntime the Patent Office commenced printing the drawings\r\nand specifications, may be had by remitting to\r\nthis office $1.\r\n\r\nA copy of the claims of any patent issued since 1836\r\nwill be furnished for $1.\r\n\r\nWhen ordering copies, please to remit for the same\r\nas above, and state name of patentee, title of invention,\r\nand date of patent.\r\n\r\nA pamphlet, containing full directions for obtaining\r\nUnited States patents sent free.
