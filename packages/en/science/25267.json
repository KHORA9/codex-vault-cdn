Noble, elevating,\r\nconsoling, divine, it gives us wings, and bears us through Infinitude.\r\nIn these ethereal regions all is pure, luminous, and splendid. Dreams of\r\nthe Ideal, even of the Inaccessible, weave their subtle spells upon us.\r\nThe imagination soars aloft, and aspires to the sources of Eternal\r\nBeauty.\r\n\r\nWhat greater delight can be conceived, on a fine spring evening, at the\r\nhour when the crescent moon is shining in the West amid the last glimmer\r\nof twilight, than the contemplation of that grand and silent spectacle\r\nof the stars stepping forth in sequence in the vast Heavens? All sounds\r\nof life die out upon the earth, the last notes of the sleepy birds have\r\nsunk away, the Angelus of the church hard by has rung the close of day.\r\nBut if life is arrested around us, we may seek it in the Heavens. These\r\nincandescing orbs are so many points of interrogation suspended above\r\nour heads in the inaccessible depths of space.... Gradually they\r\nmultiply. There is Venus, the white star of the shepherd. There Mars,\r\nthe little celestial world so near our own. There the giant Jupiter.\r\nThe seven stars of the Great Bear seem to point out the pole, while they\r\nslowly revolve around it.... What is this nebulous light that blanches\r\nthe darkness of the heavens, and traverses the constellations like a\r\ncelestial path? It is the Galaxy, the Milky Way, composed of millions on\r\nmillions of suns!... The darkness is profound, the abyss immense....\r\nSee! Yonder a shooting star glides silently across the sky, and\r\ndisappears!...\r\n\r\nWho can remain insensible to this magic spectacle of the starry Heavens?\r\nWhere is the mind that is not attracted to these enigmas? The\r\nintelligence of the amateur, the feminine, no less than the more\r\nmaterial and prosaic masculine mind, is well adapted to the\r\nconsideration of astronomical problems. Women, indeed, are naturally\r\npredisposed to these contemplative studies. And the part they are called\r\nto play in the education of our children is so vast, and so important,\r\nthat the elements of Astronomy might well be taught by the young mother\r\nherself to the budding minds that are curious about every issue--whose\r\nfirst impressions are so keen and so enduring.\r\n\r\nThroughout the ages women have occupied themselves successfully with\r\nAstronomy, not merely in its contemplative and descriptive, but also in\r\nits mathematical aspects. Of such, the most illustrious was the\r\nbeautiful and learned Hypatia of Alexandria, born in the year 375 of our\r\nera, public lecturer on geometry, algebra, and astronomy, and author of\r\nthree works of great importance. Then, in that age of ignorance and\r\nfanaticism, she fell a victim to human stupidity and malice, was dragged\r\nfrom her chariot while crossing the Cathedral Square, in March, 415,\r\nstripped of her garments, stoned to death, and burned as a dishonored\r\nwitch!\r\n\r\nAmong the women inspired with a passion for the Heavens may be cited St.\r\nCatherine of Alexandria, admired for her learning, her beauty and her\r\nvirtue. She was martyred in the reign of Maximinus Daza, about the year\r\n312, and has given her name to one of the lunar rings.\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated female mathematician was Madame Hortense Lepaute,\r\nborn in 1723, who collaborated with Clairaut in the immense calculations\r\nby which he predicted the return of Halley's Comet. \"Madame Lepaute,\"\r\nwrote Lalande, \"gave us such immense assistance that, without her, we\r\nshould never have ventured to undertake this enormous labor, in which it\r\nwas necessary to calculate for every degree, and for a hundred and fifty\r\nyears, the distances and forces of the planets acting by their\r\nattraction on the comet. During more than six months, we calculated from\r\nmorning to night, sometimes even at table, and as the result of this\r\nforced labor I contracted an illness that has changed my constitution\r\nfor life; but it was important to publish the result before the arrival\r\nof the comet.\"\r\n\r\nThis extract will suffice for the appreciation of the scientific ardor\r\nof Madame Lepaute. We are indebted to her for some considerable works.\r\nHer husband was clock-maker to the King. \"To her intellectual talents,\"\r\nsays one of her biographers, \"were joined all the qualities of the\r\nheart. She was charming to a degree, with an elegant figure, a dainty\r\nfoot, and such a beautiful hand that Voiriot, the King's painter, who\r\nhad made a portrait of her, asked permission to copy it, in order to\r\npreserve a model of the best in Nature.\" And then we are told that\r\nlearned women can not be good-looking!...\r\n\r\nThe Marquise du Châtelet was no less renowned. She was predestined to\r\nher career, if the following anecdote be credible. Gabrielle-Émilie de\r\nBreteuil, born in 1706 (who, in 1725, was to marry the Marquis du\r\nChâtelet, becoming, in 1733, the most celebrated friend of Voltaire),\r\nwas four or five years old when she was given an old compass, dressed up\r\nas a doll, for a plaything. After examining this object for some time,\r\nthe child began angrily and impatiently to strip off the silly draperies\r\nthe toy was wrapped in, and after turning it over several times in her\r\nlittle hands, she divined its uses, and traced a circle with it on a\r\nsheet of paper. To her, among other things, we owe a precious, and\r\nindeed the only French, translation of Newton's great work on universal\r\ngravitation, the famous Principia, and she was, with Voltaire, an\r\neloquent propagator of the theory of attraction, rejected at that time\r\nby the Académie des Sciences.\r\n\r\nNumbers of other women astronomers might be cited, all showing how\r\naccessible this highly abstract science is to the feminine intellect.\r\nPresident des Brosses, in his charming Voyage en Italie, tells of the\r\nvisit he paid in Milan to the young Italian, Marie Agnesi, who delivered\r\nharangues in Latin, and was acquainted with seven languages, and for\r\nwhom mathematics held no secrets. She was devoted to algebra and\r\ngeometry, which, she said, \"are the only provinces of thought wherein\r\npeace reigns.\" Madame de Charrière expressed herself in an aphorism of\r\nthe same order: \"An hour or two of mathematics sets my mind at liberty,\r\nand puts me in good spirits; I feel that I can eat and sleep better when\r\nI have seen obvious and indisputable truths. This consoles me for the\r\nobscurities of religion and metaphysics, or rather makes me forget them;\r\nI am thankful there is something positive in this world.\" And did not\r\nMadame de Blocqueville, last surviving daughter of Marshal Davout, who\r\ndied in 1892, exclaim in her turn: \"Astronomy, science of sciences! by\r\nwhich I am attracted, and terrified, and which I adore! By it my soul is\r\ndetached from the things of this world, for it draws me to those unknown\r\nspheres that evoked from Newton the triumphant cry: '_Coeli enarrant\r\ngloriam Dei!_'\"\r\n\r\nNor must we omit Miss Caroline Herschel, sister of the greatest observer\r\nof the Heavens, the grandest discoverer of the stars, that has ever\r\nlived. Astronomy gave her a long career; she discovered no less than\r\nseven comets herself, and her patient labors preserved her to the age of\r\nninety-eight.--And Mrs. Somerville, to whom we owe the English\r\ntranslation of Laplace's Mécanique céleste, of whom Humboldt said, \"In\r\npure mathematics, Mrs. Somerville is absolutely superior.\" Like Caroline\r\nHerschel, she was almost a centenarian, appearing always much younger\r\nthan her years: she died at Naples, in 1872, at the age of\r\nninety-two.--So, too, the Russian Sophie Kovalevsky, descendant of\r\nMathias Corvinus, King of Hungary, who, an accomplished mathematician at\r\nsixteen, married at eighteen, in order to follow the curriculum at the\r\nUniversity (then forbidden to unmarried women); arranging with her young\r\nhusband to live as brother and sister until their studies should be\r\ncompleted. In 1888 the Prix Bordin of the Institut was conferred on\r\nher.--And Maria Mitchell of the United States, for whom Le Verrier gave\r\na _fête_ at the Observatory of Paris, and who was exceptionally\r\nauthorized by Pope Pius IX to visit the Observatory of the Roman\r\nCollege, at that time an ecclesiastical establishment, closed to\r\nwomen.--And Madame Scarpellini, the Roman astronomer, renowned for her\r\nworks on shooting stars, whom the author had the honor of visiting, in\r\ncompany with Father Secchi, Director of the Observatory mentioned above.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, Astronomy is proud to reckon among its most famous\r\nworkers Miss Agnes Clerke, the learned Irishwoman, to whom we owe,\r\n_inter alia_, an excellent History of Astronomy in the Nineteenth\r\nCentury;--Mrs. Isaac Roberts, who, under the familiar name of Miss\r\nKlumpke, sat on the Council of the Astronomical Society of France, and\r\nis D. Sc. of the Faculty of Paris and head of the Bureau for measuring\r\nstar photographs at the Observatory of Paris (an American who became\r\nEnglish by her marriage with the astronomer Roberts, but is not\r\nforgotten in France);--Mrs. Fleming, one of the astronomers of the\r\nObservatory at Harvard College, U.S.A., to whom we owe the discovery of\r\na great number of variable stars by the examination of photographic\r\nrecords, and by spectral photography;--Lady Huggins, who in England is\r\nthe learned collaborator of her illustrious husband;--and many others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following chapters, which aim at summing up the essentials of\r\nAstronomy in twelve lessons for amateurs, will not make astronomers or\r\nmathematicians of my readers--much less prigs or pedants. They are\r\ndesigned to show the constitution of the Universe, in its grandeur and\r\nits beauty, so that, inhabiting this world, we may know where we are\r\nliving, may realize our position in the Cosmos, appreciate Creation as\r\nit is, and enjoy it to better advantage. This sun by which we live, this\r\nsuccession of months and years, of days and nights, the apparent motions\r\nof the heavens, these starry skies, the divine rays of the moon, the\r\nwhole totality of things, constitutes in some sort the tissue of our\r\nexistence, and it is indeed extraordinary that the inhabitants of our\r\nplanet should almost all have lived till now without knowing where they\r\nare, without suspecting the marvels of the Universe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the rest, my little book is dedicated to a woman, muse and\r\ngoddess--the charming enchantress Urania, fit companion of Venus,\r\nranking even above her in the choir of celestial beauties, as purer and\r\nmore noble, dominating with her clear glance the immensities of the\r\nuniverse. Urania, be it noted, is feminine, and never would the poetry\r\nof the ancients have imagined a masculine symbol to personify the\r\npageant of the heavens. Not Uranus, nor Saturn, nor Jupiter can compare\r\nwith the ideal beauty of Urania.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I have before me two delightful books, in breviary binding,\r\ndated the one from the year 1686, the other from a century later, 1786.\r\nThe first was written by Fontenelle for a Marquise, and is entitled\r\nEntretiens sur la Pluralité des Mondes. In this, banter is pleasantly\r\nmarried with science, the author declaring that he only demands from his\r\nfair readers the amount of application they would concede to a novel.\r\nThe second is written by Lalande, and is called Astronomie des Dames. In\r\naddressing myself to both sexes, I am in honorable company with these\r\ntwo sponsors and esteem myself the better for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE CONTEMPLATION OF THE HEAVENS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crimson disk of the Sun has plunged beneath the Ocean. The sea has\r\ndecked itself with the burning colors of the orb, reflected from the\r\nHeavens in a mirror of turquoise and emerald. The rolling waves are gold\r\nand silver, and break noisily on a shore already darkened by the\r\ndisappearance of the celestial luminary.\r\n\r\nWe gaze regretfully after the star of day, that poured its cheerful rays\r\nanon so generously over many who were intoxicated with gaiety and\r\nhappiness. We dream, contemplating the magnificent spectacle, and in\r\ndreaming forget the moments that are rapidly flying by. Yet the darkness\r\ngradually increases, and twilight gives way to night.\r\n\r\nThe most indifferent spectator of the setting Sun as it descends beneath\r\nthe waves at the far horizon, could hardly be unmoved by the pageant of\r\nNature at such an impressive moment.\r\n\r\nThe light of the Crescent Moon, like some fairy boat suspended in the\r\nsky, is bright enough to cast changing and dancing sparkles of silver\r\nupon the ocean. The Evening Star declines slowly in its turn toward the\r\nwestern horizon. Our gaze is held by a shining world that dominates the\r\nwhole of the occidental heavens. This is the \"Shepherd's Star,\" Venus of\r\nrays translucent.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, one by one, the more brilliant stars shine out. Here\r\nare the white Vega of the Lyre, the burning Arcturus, the seven stars of\r\nthe Great Bear, a whole sidereal population catching fire, like\r\ninnumerable eyes that open on the Infinite. It is a new life that is\r\nrevealed to our imagination, inviting us to soar into these mysterious\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nO Night, diapered with fires innumerable! hast thou not written in\r\nflaming letters on these Constellations the syllables of the great\r\nenigma of Eternity? The contemplation of thee is a wonder and a charm.\r\nHow rapidly canst thou efface the regrets we suffered on the departure\r\nof our beloved Sun! What wealth, what beauty hast thou not reserved for\r\nour enraptured souls! Where is the man that can remain blind to such a\r\npageant and deaf to its language!\r\n\r\nTo whatever quarter of the Heavens we look, the splendors of the night\r\nare revealed to our astonished gaze. These celestial eyes seem in their\r\nturn to gaze at, and to question us. Thus indeed have they questioned\r\nevery thinking soul, so long as Humanity has existed on our Earth. Homer\r\nsaw and sung these self-same stars. They shone upon the slow succession\r\nof civilizations that have disappeared, from Egypt of the period of the\r\nPyramids, Greece at the time of the Trojan War, Rome and Carthage,\r\nConstantine and Charlemagne, down to the Twentieth Century. The\r\ngenerations are buried with the dust of their ancient temples. The Stars\r\nare still there, symbols of Eternity.\r\n\r\nThe silence of the vast and starry Heavens may terrify us; its immensity\r\nmay seem to overwhelm us. But our inquiring thought flies curiously on\r\nthe wings of dream, toward the remotest regions of the visible. It rests\r\non one star and another, like the butterfly on the flower. It seeks what\r\nwill best respond to its aspirations: and thus a kind of communication\r\nis established, and, as it were, protected by all Nature in these silent\r\nappeals. Our sense of solitude has disappeared. We feel that, if only as\r\ninfinitesimal atoms, we form part of that immense universe, and this\r\ndumb language of the starry night is more eloquent than any speech. Each\r\nstar becomes a friend, a discreet confidant, often indeed a precious\r\ncounsellor, for all the thoughts it suggests to us are pure and holy.\r\n\r\nIs any poem finer than the book written in letters of fire upon the\r\ntablets of the firmament? Nothing could be more ideal. And yet, the\r\npoetic sentiment that the beauty of Heaven awakens in our soul ought\r\nnot to veil its reality from us. That is no less marvelous than the\r\nmystery by which we were enchanted.\r\n\r\nAnd here we may ask ourselves how many there are, even among thinking\r\nhuman beings, who ever raise their eyes to the starry heavens? How many\r\nmen and women are sincerely, and with unfeigned curiosity, interested in\r\nthese shining specks, and inaccessible luminaries, and really desirous\r\nof a better acquaintance with them?\r\n\r\nSeek, talk, ask in the intercourse of daily life. You, who read these\r\npages, who already love the Heavens, and comprehend them, who desire to\r\naccount for our existence in this world, who seek to know what the Earth\r\nis, and what Heaven--you shall witness that the number of those\r\ninquiring after truth is so limited that no one dares to speak of it, so\r\ndisgraceful is it to the so-called intelligence of our race. And yet!\r\nthe great Book of the Heavens is open to all eyes. What pleasures await\r\nus in the study of the Universe! Nothing could speak more eloquently to\r\nour heart and intellect!\r\n\r\nAstronomy is the science _par excellence_. It is the most beautiful and\r\nmost ancient of all, inasmuch as it dates back to the indeterminate\r\ntimes of highest antiquity. Its mission is not only to make us\r\nacquainted with the innumerable orbs by which our nights are\r\nilluminated, but it is, moreover, thanks to it that we know where and\r\nwhat we are. Without it we should live as the blind, in eternal\r\nignorance of the very conditions of our terrestrial existence. Without\r\nit we should still be penetrated with the naïve error that reduced the\r\nentire Universe to our minute globule, making our Humanity the goal of\r\nthe Creation, and should have no exact notion of the immense reality.\r\n\r\nTo-day, thanks to the intellectual labor of so many centuries, thanks\r\nalso to the immortal genius of the men of science who have devoted their\r\nlives to searching after Truth--men such as Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler,\r\nNewton--the veil of ignorance has been rent, and glimpses of the marvels\r\nof creation are perceptible in their splendid truth to the dazzled eye\r\nof the thinker.\r\n\r\nThe study of Astronomy is not, as many suppose, the sacrifice of oneself\r\nin a cerebral torture that obliterates all the beauty, the fascination,\r\nand the grandeur of the pageant of Nature. Figures, and naught but\r\nfigures, would not be entertaining, even to those most desirous of\r\ninstruction. Let the reader take courage! We do not propose that he\r\nshall decipher the hieroglyphics of algebra and geometry. Perish the\r\nthought! For the rest, figures are but the scaffolding, the method, and\r\ndo not exist in Nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--The great Book of the Heavens is open to all\r\neyes.]\r\n\r\nWe simply beg of you to open your eyes, to see where you are, so that\r\nyou may not stray from the path of truth, which is also the path of\r\nhappiness. Once you have entered upon it, no persuasion will be needed\r\nto make you persevere. And you will have the profound satisfaction of\r\nknowing that you are thinking correctly, and that it is infinitely\r\nbetter to be educated than to be ignorant. The reality is far beyond all\r\ndreams, beyond the most fantastic imagination. The most fairy-like\r\ntransformations of our theaters, the most resplendent pageants of our\r\nmilitary reviews, the most sumptuous marvels on which the human race can\r\npride itself--all that we admire, all that we envy on the Earth--is as\r\nnothing compared with the unheard-of wonders scattered through\r\nInfinitude. There are so many that one does not know how to see them.\r\nThe fascinated eye would fain grasp all at once.\r\n\r\nIf you will yield yourselves to the pleasure of gazing upon the\r\nsparkling fires of Space, you will never regret the moments passed all\r\ntoo rapidly in the contemplation of the Heavens.\r\n\r\nDiamonds, turquoises, rubies, emeralds, all the precious stones with\r\nwhich women love to deck themselves, are to be found in greater\r\nperfection, more beautiful, and more splendid, set in the immensity of\r\nHeaven! In the telescopic field, we may watch the progress of armies of\r\nmajestic and powerful suns, from whose attacks there is naught to fear.\r\nAnd these vagabond comets and shooting stars and stellar nebulæ, do they\r\nnot make up a prodigious panorama? What are our romances in comparison\r\nwith the History of Nature? Soaring toward the Infinite, we purify our\r\nsouls from all the baseness of this world, we strive to become better\r\nand more intelligent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut in the first place, you ask, what are the Heavens? This vault\r\noppresses us. We can not venture to investigate it.\r\n\r\nHeaven, we reply, is no vault, it is a limitless immensity,\r\ninconceivable, unfathomable, that surrounds us on all sides, and in the\r\nmidst of which our globe is floating. THE HEAVENS ARE ALL THAT EXISTS,\r\nall that we see, and all that we do not see: the Earth on which we are,\r\nthat bears us onward in her rapid flight; the Moon that accompanies us,\r\nand sheds her soft beams upon our silent nights; the good Sun to which\r\nwe owe our existence; the Stars, suns of Infinitude; in a word--the\r\nwhole of Creation.\r\n\r\nYes, our Earth is an orb of the Heavens: the sky is her domain, and our\r\nSun, shining above our heads, and fertilizing our seasons, is as much a\r\nstar as the pretty sparkling points that scintillate up there, in the\r\nfar distance, and embellish the calm of our nights with their\r\nbrilliancy. All are in the Heavens, you as well as I, for the Earth, in\r\nher course through Space, bears us with herself into the depths of\r\nInfinitude.\r\n\r\nIn the Heavens there is neither \"above\" nor \"below.\" These words do not\r\nexist in celestial speech, because their significance is relative to the\r\nsurface of this planet only. In reality, for the inhabitants of the\r\nEarth, \"low\" is the inside, the center of the globe, and \"high\" is what\r\nis above our heads, all round the Earth. The Heavens are what surround\r\nus on all sides, to Infinity.\r\n\r\nThe Earth is, like her fellows, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,\r\nUranus, Neptune, one of the planets of the great solar family.\r\n\r\nThe Sun, her father, protects her, and directs all her actions. She, as\r\nthe grateful daughter, obeys him blindly. All float in perfect harmony\r\nover the celestial ocean.\r\n\r\nBut, you may say, on what does the Earth rest in her ethereal\r\nnavigation?\r\n\r\nOn nothing. The Earth turns round the colossal Sun, a little globe of\r\nrelatively light weight, isolated on all sides in Space, like a\r\nsoap-bubble blown by some careless child.\r\n\r\nAbove, below, on all sides, millions of similar globes are grouped into\r\nfamilies, and form other systems of worlds revolving round the numerous\r\nand distant stars that people Infinitude; suns more or less analogous to\r\nthat by which we are illuminated, and generally speaking of larger bulk,\r\nalthough our Sun is a million times larger than our planet.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients, before the isolation of our globe in Space and the\r\nmotions that incessantly alter its position were recognized, the Earth\r\nwas supposed to be the immobile lower half of the Universe. The sky was\r\nregarded as the upper half. The ancients supplied our world with\r\nfantastic supports that penetrated to the Infernal Regions. They could\r\nnot admit the notion of the Earth's isolation, because they had a false\r\nidea of its weight. To-day, however, we know positively that the Earth\r\nis based on nothing. The innumerable journeys accomplished round it in\r\nall directions give definite proof of this. It is attached to nothing.\r\nAs we said before, there is neither \"above\" nor \"below\" in the Universe.\r\nWhat we call \"below\" is the center of the Earth. For the rest the Earth\r\nturns upon its own axis in twenty-four hours. Night is only a partial\r\nphenomenon, due to the rotary motion of the planet, a motion that could\r\nnot exist under conditions other than that of the absolute isolation of\r\nour globe in space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--The earth in space. June solstice, midday.]\r\n\r\nSince the Sun can only illuminate one side of our globe at one moment,\r\nthat is to say one hemisphere, it follows that Night is nothing but the\r\nstate of the part that is not illuminated. As the Earth revolves upon\r\nitself, all the parts successively exposed to the Sun are in the day,\r\nwhile the parts situated opposite to the Sun, in the cone of shadow\r\nproduced by the Earth itself, are in night. But whether it be noon or\r\nmidnight, the stars always occupy the same position in the Heavens,\r\neven when, dazzled by the ardent light of the orb of day, we can no\r\nlonger see them; and when we are plunged into the darkness of the night,\r\nthe god Phoebus still continues to pour his beneficent rays upon the\r\ncountries turned toward him.\r\n\r\nThe sequence of day and night is a phenomenon belonging, properly\r\nspeaking, to the Earth, in which the rest of the Universe does not\r\nparticipate. The same occurs for every world that is illuminated by a\r\nsun, and endowed with a rotary movement. In absolute space, there is no\r\nsuccession of nights and days.\r\n\r\nUpheld in space by forces that will be explained at a later point, our\r\nplanet glides in the open heavens round our Sun.\r\n\r\nImagine a magnificent aerostat, lightly and rapidly cleaving space.\r\nSurround it with eight little balloons of different sizes, the smallest\r\nlike those sold on the streets for children to play with, the larger,\r\nsuch as are distributed for a bonus in large stores. Imagine this group\r\nsailing through the air, and you have the system of our worlds in\r\nminiature.\r\n\r\nStill, this is only an image, a comparison. The balloons are held up by\r\nthe atmosphere, in which they float at equilibrium. The Earth is\r\nsustained by nothing material. What maintains her in equilibrium is the\r\nethereal void; an immaterial force; gravitation. The Sun attracts her,\r\nand if she did not revolve, she would drop into him; but rotating round\r\nhim, at a speed of 107,000 kilometers[2] (about 66,000 miles) per hour,\r\nshe produces a centrifugal force, like that of a stone in a sling, that\r\nis precisely equivalent, and of contrary sign, to its gravitation toward\r\nthe central orb, and these two equilibrated forces keep her at the same\r\nmedium distance.\r\n\r\nThis solar and planetary group does not exist solitary in the immense\r\nvoid that extends indefinitely around us. As we said above, each star\r\nthat we admire in the depths of the sky, and to which we lift up our\r\neyes and thoughts during the charmed hours of the night, is another sun\r\nburning with its own light, the chief of a more or less numerous family,\r\nsuch as are multiplied through all space to infinity. Notwithstanding\r\nthe immense distances between the sun-stars, Space is so vast, and the\r\nnumber of these so great, that by an effect of perspective due solely to\r\nthe distance, appearances would lead us to believe that the stars were\r\ntouching. And under certain telescopic aspects, and in some of the\r\nastral photographs, they really do appear to be contiguous.\r\n\r\nThe Universe is infinite. Space is limitless. If our love for the\r\nHeavens should incite in us the impulse, and provide us with the means\r\nof undertaking a journey directed to the ends of Heaven as its goal, we\r\nshould be astonished, on arriving at the confines of the Milky Way, to\r\nsee the grandiose and phenomenal spectacle of a new Universe unfold\r\nbefore our dazzled eyes; and if in our mad career we crossed this new\r\narchipelago of worlds to seek the barriers of Heaven beyond them, we\r\nshould still find universe eternally succeeding to universe before us.\r\nMillions of suns roll on in the immensities of Space. Everywhere, on all\r\nsides, Creation renews itself in an infinite variety.\r\n\r\nAccording to all the probabilities, universal life is distributed there\r\nas well as here, and has sown the germ of intelligence upon those\r\ndistant worlds that we divine in the vicinity of the innumerable suns\r\nthat plow the ether, for everything upon the Earth tends to show that\r\nLife is the goal of Nature. Burning foci, inextinguishable sources of\r\nwarmth and light, these various, multi-colored suns shed their rays upon\r\nthe worlds that belong to them and which they fertilize.\r\n\r\nOur globe is no exception in the Universe. As we have seen, it is one of\r\nthe celestial orbs, nourished, warmed, lighted, quickened by the Sun,\r\nwhich in its turn again is but a star.\r\n\r\nInnumerable Worlds! We dream of them. Who can say that their unknown\r\ninhabitants do not think of us in their turn, and that Space may not be\r\ntraversed by waves of thought, as it is by the vibrations of light and\r\nuniversal gravitation? May not an immense solidarity, hardly guessed at\r\nby our imperfect senses, exist between the Celestial Humanities, our\r\nEarth being only a modest planet.\r\n\r\nLet us meditate on this Infinity! Let us lose no opportunity of\r\nemploying the best of our hours, those of the silence and peace of the\r\nbewitching nights, in contemplating, admiring, spelling out the words of\r\nthe Great Book of the Heavens. Let our freed souls fly swift and rapt\r\ntoward those marvelous countries where indescribable joys are prepared\r\nfor us, and let us do homage to the first and most splendid of the\r\nsciences, to Astronomy, which diffuses the light of Truth within us.\r\n\r\nTo poetical souls, the contemplation of the Heavens carries thought away\r\nto higher regions than it attains in any other meditation. Who does not\r\nremember the beautiful lines of Victor Hugo in the Orientales? Who has\r\nnot heard or read them? The poem is called \"Ecstasy,\" and it is a\r\nfitting title. The words are sometimes set to music, and the melody\r\nseems to complete their pure beauty:\r\n\r\n          J'étais seul près des flots par une nuit d'étoiles.\r\n          Pas un nuage aux cieux, sur les mers pas de voiles;\r\n          Mes yeux plongeaient plus loin que le monde réel,\r\n          Et les bois et les monts et toute la nature\r\n          Semblaient interroger, dans un confus murmure,\r\n              Les flots des mers, les feux du ciel.\r\n\r\n          Et les étoiles d'or, légions infinies,\r\n          A voix haute, à voix basse, avec mille harmonies\r\n          Disaient, en inclinant leurs couronnes de feu;\r\n          Et les flots bleus, que rien ne gouverne et n'arrête,\r\n          Disaient en recourbant l'écume de leur crête:\r\n              ... C'est le Seigneur, le Seigneur Dieu!\r\n\r\n_Note: Free Translation_\r\n\r\n          I was alone on the waves, on a starry night,\r\n          Not a cloud in the sky, not a sail in sight,\r\n          My eyes pierced beyond the natural world...\r\n          And the woods, and the hills, and the voice of Nature\r\n          Seemed to question in a confused murmur,\r\n              The waves of the Sea, and Heaven's fires.\r\n\r\n          And the golden stars in infinite legion,\r\n          Sang loudly, and softly, in glad recognition,\r\n          Inclining their crowns of fire;...\r\n          And the waves that naught can check nor arrest\r\n          Sang, bowing the foam of their haughty crest...\r\n              Behold the Lord God--Jehovah!\r\n\r\nThe immortal poet of France was an astronomer. The author more than\r\nonce had the honor of conversing with him on the problems of the starry\r\nsky--and reflected that astronomers might well be poets.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed difficult to resist a sense of profound emotion before the\r\nabysses of infinite Space, when we behold the innumerable multitude of\r\nworlds suspended above our heads. We feel in this solitary contemplation\r\nof the Heavens that there is more in the Universe than tangible and\r\nvisible matter: that there are forces, laws, destinies. Our ants' brains\r\nmay know themselves microscopic, and yet recognize that there is\r\nsomething greater than the Earth, the Heavens;--more absolute than the\r\nVisible, the Invisible;--beyond the more or less vulgar affairs of life,\r\nthe sense of the True, the Good, the Beautiful. We feel that an immense\r\nmystery broods over Nature,--over Being, over created things. And it is\r\nhere again that Astronomy surpasses all the other sciences, that it\r\nbecomes our sovereign teacher, that it is the _pharos_ of modern\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nO Night, mysterious, sublime, and infinite! withdrawing from our eyes\r\nthe veil spread above us by the light of day, giving back transparency\r\nto the Heavens, showing us the prodigious reality, the shining casket of\r\nthe celestial diamonds, the innumerable stars that succeed each other\r\ninterminably in immeasurable space! Without Night we should know\r\nnothing. Without it our eyes would never have divined the sidereal\r\npopulation, our intellects would never have pierced the harmony of the\r\nHeavens, and we should have remained the blind, deaf parasites of a\r\nworld isolated from the rest of the universe. O Sacred Night! If on the\r\none hand it rests upon the heights of Truth beyond the day's illusions,\r\non the other its invisible urns pour down a silent and tranquil peace, a\r\npenetrating calm, upon our souls that weary of Life's fever. It makes us\r\nforget the struggles, perfidies, intrigues, the miseries of the hours of\r\ntoil and noisy activity, all the conventionalities of civilization. Its\r\ndomain is that of rest and dreams. We love it for its peace and calm\r\ntranquillity. We love it because it is true. We love it because it\r\nplaces us in communication with the other worlds, because it gives us\r\nthe presage of Life, Universal and Eternal, because it brings us Hope,\r\nbecause it proclaims us citizens of Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTELLATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Chapter I we saw the Earth hanging in space, like a globe isolated on\r\nall sides, and surrounded at vast distances by a multitude of stars.\r\n\r\nThese fiery orbs are suns like that which illuminates ourselves. They\r\nshine by their own light. We know this for a fact, because they are so\r\nfar off that they could neither be illuminated by the Sun, nor, still\r\nmore, reflect his rays back upon us: and because, on the other hand, we\r\nhave been able to measure and analyze their light. Many of these distant\r\nsuns are simple and isolated; others are double, triple, or multiple;\r\nothers appear to be the centers of systems analogous to that which\r\ngravitates round our own Sun, and of which we form part. But these\r\ncelestial tribes are situated at such remote distances from us that it\r\nis impossible to distinguish all the individuals of each particular\r\nfamily. The most delicate observations have only revealed a few of them.\r\nWe must content ourselves here with admiring the principals,--the\r\nsun-stars,--prodigious globes, flaming torches, scattered profusely\r\nthrough the firmament.\r\n\r\nHow, then, is one to distinguish them? How can they be readily found and\r\nnamed? There are so many of them!\r\n\r\nDo not fear; it is quite a simple matter. In studying the surface of the\r\nEarth we make use of geographical maps on which the continents and seas\r\nof which it consists are drawn with the utmost care. Each country of our\r\nplanet is subdivided into states, each of which has its proper name. We\r\nshall pursue the same plan in regard to the Heavens, and it will be all\r\nthe easier since the Great Book of the Firmament is constantly open to\r\nour gaze. Our globe, moreover, actually revolves upon itself so that we\r\nread the whole in due sequence. Given a clear atmosphere, and a little\r\nstimulus to the will from our love of truth and science, and the\r\ngeography of the Heavens, or \"uranography,\" will soon be as familiar to\r\nus as the geography of our terrestrial atom.\r\n\r\nOn a beautiful summer's night, when we look toward the starry sky, we\r\nare at first aware only of a number of shining specks. The stars seem to\r\nbe scattered almost accidentally through Space; they are so numerous and\r\nso close to one another that it would appear rash to attempt to name\r\nthem separately. Yet some of the brighter ones particularly attract and\r\nexcite our attention. After a little observation we notice a certain\r\nregularity in the arrangement of these distant suns, and take pleasure\r\nin drawing imaginary figures round the celestial groups.\r\n\r\nThat is what the ancients did from a practical point of view. In order\r\nto guide themselves across the trackless ocean, the earliest Phenician\r\nnavigators noted certain fixed bearings in the sky, by which they mapped\r\nout their routes. In this way they discovered the position of the\r\nimmovable Pole, and acquired empire over the sea. The Chaldean pastors,\r\ntoo, the nomad people of the East, invoked the Heavens to assist in\r\ntheir migrations. They grouped the more brilliant of the stars into\r\nConstellations with simple outlines, and gave to each of these celestial\r\nprovinces a name derived from mythology, history, or from the natural\r\nkingdoms. It is impossible to determine the exact epoch of this\r\nprimitive celestial geography. The Centaur Chiron, Jason's tutor, was\r\nreputed the first to divide the Heavens upon the sphere of the\r\nArgonauts. But this origin is a little mythical! In the Bible we have\r\nthe Prophet Job, who names Orion, the Pleiades, and the Hyades, 3,300\r\nyears ago. The Babylonian Tables, and the hieroglyphs of Egypt, witness\r\nto an astronomy that had made considerable advance even in those remote\r\nepochs. Our actual constellations, which are doubtless of Babylonian\r\norigin, appear to have been arranged in their present form by the\r\nlearned philosopher Eudoxus of Cnidus, about the year 360 B.C. Aratus\r\nsang of them in a didactic poem toward 270. Hipparchus of Rhodes was the\r\nfirst to note the astronomical positions with any precision, one hundred\r\nand thirty years before our era. He classified the stars in order of\r\nmagnitude, according to their apparent brightness; and his catalogue,\r\npreserved in the Almagest of Ptolemy, contains 1,122 stars distributed\r\ninto forty-eight Constellations.\r\n\r\nThe figures of the constellations, taken almost entirely from fable, are\r\nvisible only to the eyes of the imagination, and where the ancients\r\nplaced such and such a person or animal, we may see, with a little\r\ngood-will, anything we choose to fancy. There is nothing real about\r\nthese figures. And yet it is indispensable to be able to recognize the\r\nconstellations in order to find our way among the innumerable army of\r\nthe stars, and we shall commence this study with the description of the\r\nmost popular and best known of them all, the one that circles every\r\nnight through our Northern Heavens. Needless to name it; it is familiar\r\nto every one. You have already exclaimed--the Great Bear!\r\n\r\nThis vast and splendid association of suns, which is also known as the\r\nChariot of David, the Plow or Charles's Wain, and the Dipper, is one of\r\nthe finest constellations in the Heavens, and one of the oldest--seeing\r\nthat the Chinese hailed it as the divinity of the North, over three\r\nthousand years ago.\r\n\r\nIf any of my readers should happen to forget its position in the sky,\r\nthe following is a very simple expedient for finding it. Turn to the\r\nNorth--that is, opposite to the point where the sun is to be found at\r\nmidday. Whatever the season of the year, day of the month, or hour of\r\nthe night, you will always see, high up in the firmament, seven\r\nmagnificent stars, arranged in a quadrilateral, followed by a tail, or\r\nhandle, of three stars. This magnificent constellation never sinks below\r\nour horizon. Night and day it watches above us, turning in twenty-four\r\nhours round a very famous star that we shall shortly become acquainted\r\nwith. In the figure of the Great Bear, the four stars of the\r\nquadrilateral are found in the body, and the three at the extremity make\r\nthe tail. As David's Chariot, the four stars represent the wheels, and\r\nthe three others the horses.\r\n\r\nSometimes our ancestors called them the Seven Oxen, the \"oxen of the\r\ncelestial pastures,\" from which the word septentrion (_septem triones_,\r\nseven oxen of labor) is derived. Some see a Plowshare; others more\r\nfamiliarly call this figure the Dipper. As it rotates round the pole,\r\nits outline varies with the different positions.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to guess why this constellation should have been called\r\nthe Bear. Yet the name has had a certain influence. From the Greek word\r\n_arctos_ (bear) has come arctic, and for its antithesis, antarctic. From\r\nthe Latin word _trio_ (ox of labor) has come septentrion, the seven\r\noxen. Etymology is not always logical. Is not the word \"venerate\"\r\nderived from Venus?\r\n\r\nIn order to distinguish one star from another, the convention of\r\ndenoting them by the letters of the Greek Alphabet has been adopted, for\r\nit would be impossible to give a name to each, so considerable is their\r\nnumber.[3]\r\n\r\n[alpha] and [beta] denote the front wheels of the Chariot generally\r\nknown as the \"pointers;\" [gamma] and [delta] the hind wheels; [epsilon],\r\n[zeta], [eta] the three horses. All these stars are of the second order\r\nof magnitude (the specific meaning of this expression will be explained\r\nin the next chapter), except the last ([delta]) of the quadrilateral,\r\nwhich is of the third order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--The Great Bear (or Dipper), and the Pole-Star.]\r\n\r\nFigure 3 gives the outline of this primitive constellation. In revolving\r\nin twenty-four hours round the Pole, which is situated at the\r\nprolongation of a line drawn from [beta] to [alpha], it occupies every\r\nconceivable position,--as if this page were turned in all directions.\r\nBut the relative arrangement of the seven stars remains unaltered. In\r\ncontemplating these seven stars it must never be forgotten that each is\r\na dazzling sun, a center of force and life. One of them is especially\r\nremarkable: [zeta], known as Mizar to the Arabs. Those who have good\r\nsight will distinguish near it a minute star, Alcor, or the Cavalier,\r\nalso called Saidak by the Arabs--that is, the Test, because it can be\r\nused as a test of vision. But further, if you have a small telescope at\r\nyour disposal, direct it upon the fine star Mizar: you will be\r\nastonished at discovering two of the finest diamonds you could wish to\r\nsee, with which no brilliant is comparable. There are several double\r\nstars; these we shall become acquainted with later on.\r\n\r\nMeantime, we must not forget our celestial geography. The Great Bear\r\nwill help us to find all the adjacent constellations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--To find the Pole-Star.]\r\n\r\nIf a straight line is drawn (Fig. 4) from [beta] through [alpha], which\r\nforms the extremity of the square, and is prolonged by a quantity equal\r\nto the distance of [alpha] from the tip of the handle, we come on a star\r\nof second magnitude, which marks the extremity of a figure perfectly\r\ncomparable with the Great Bear, but smaller, less brilliant, and\r\npointing in the contrary direction. This is the Little Bear, composed,\r\nlike its big brother, of seven stars; the one situated at the end of the\r\nline by which we have found it is the Pole-Star.\r\n\r\nImmovable in the region of the North Pole, the Pole-Star has captivated\r\nall eyes by its position in the firmament. It is the providence of\r\nmariners who have gone astray on the ocean, for it points them to the\r\nNorth, while it is the pivot of the immense rotation accomplished round\r\nit by all the stars in twenty-four hours. Hence it is a very important\r\nfactor, and we must hasten to find it, and render it due homage. It\r\nshould be added that its special immobility, in the prolongation of the\r\nEarth's axis, is merely an effect caused by the diurnal movements of our\r\nplanet. Our readers are of course aware that it is the earth that turns\r\nand not the sky. But evidence of this will be given later on. In looking\r\nat the Pole-Star, the South is behind one, the East to the right, and\r\nthe West to the left.\r\n\r\nBetween the Great and the Little Bear, we can distinguish a winding\r\nprocession of smaller stars. These constitute the Dragon.\r\n\r\nWe will continue our journey by way of Cassiopeia, a fine constellation\r\nplaced on the opposite side of the Pole-Star in relation to the Great\r\nBear, and shaped somewhat like the open limbs of the letter W. It is\r\nalso called the Chair. And, in fact, when the figure is represented with\r\nthe line [alpha] [beta] below, the line [chi] [gamma] forms the seat,\r\nand [gamma] [delta] [epsilon] its back.\r\n\r\nIf a straight line is drawn from [delta] of the Great Bear, and\r\nprolonged beyond the Pole-Star in a quantity equal to the distance which\r\nseparates these two stars, it is easy to find this constellation (Fig.\r\n5). This group, like the preceding, never sets, and is always visible,\r\nopposite to the Great Bear. It revolves in twenty-four hours round the\r\nPole-Star, and is to be seen, now above, now below, now to the right,\r\nnow to the left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--To find Cassiopeia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--To Find Pegasus and Andromeda.]\r\n\r\nIf in the next place, starting from the stars [alpha] and [delta] in the\r\nGreat Bear, we draw two lines which join at Polaris and are prolonged\r\nbeyond Cassiopeia, we arrive at the Square of Pegasus (Fig. 6), a vast\r\nconstellation that terminates on one side in a prolongation formed of\r\nthree stars.\r\n\r\nThese three last stars belong to Andromeda, and themselves abut on\r\nPerseus. The last star in the Square of Pegasus is also the first in\r\nAndromeda.\r\n\r\n[gamma] of Andromeda is a magnificent double orb, to which we shall\r\nreturn in the next chapter, _i.e._, the telescope resolves it into two\r\nmarvelous suns, one of which is topaz-yellow, and the other\r\nemerald-green. Three stars, indeed, are visible with more powerful\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Perseus, the Pleiades, Capella.]\r\n\r\nAbove [beta] and near a small star, is visible a faint, whitish,\r\nluminous trail: this is the oblong nebula of Andromeda, the first\r\nmentioned in the history of astronomy, and one of the most beautiful in\r\nthe Heavens, perceptible to the unaided eye on very clear nights.\r\n\r\nThe stars [alpha], [beta] and [gamma] of Perseus form a concave bow\r\nwhich will serve in a new orientation. If it is prolonged in the\r\ndirection of [delta], we find a very brilliant star of the first\r\nmagnitude. This is Capella, the Goat, in the constellation of the\r\nCharioteer (Fig. 7).\r\n\r\nIf coming back to [delta] in Perseus, a line is drawn toward the South,\r\nwe reach the Pleiades, a gorgeous cluster of stars, scintillating like\r\nthe finest dust of diamonds, on the shoulder of the Bull, to which we\r\nshall come shortly, in studying the Constellations of the Zodiac.\r\n\r\nNot far off is a very curious star, [beta] of Perseus, or Algol, which\r\nforms a little triangle with two others smaller than itself. This star\r\nis peculiar in that, instead of shining with a fixed light, it varies in\r\nintensity, and is sometimes pale, sometimes brilliant. It belongs to the\r\ncategory of variable stars which we shall study later on. All the\r\nobservations made on it for more than two hundred years go to prove that\r\na dark star revolves round this sun, almost in the plane of our line of\r\nsight, producing as it passes in front of it a partial eclipse that\r\nreduces it from the second to the fourth magnitude, every other two\r\ndays, twenty hours, and forty-nine minutes.\r\n\r\nAnd now, let us return to the Great Bear, which aided us so beneficently\r\nto start for these distant shores, and whence we shall set out afresh in\r\nsearch of other constellations.\r\n\r\nIf we produce the curved line of the tail, or handle, we encounter a\r\nmagnificent golden-yellow star, a splendid sun of dazzling brilliancy:\r\nlet us make our bow to Arcturus, [alpha] of the Herdsman, which is at\r\nthe extremity of this pentagonal constellation. The principal stars of\r\nthis asterism are of the third magnitude, with the exception of [alpha],\r\nwhich is of the first. Alongside of the Herdsman is a circle consisting\r\nof five stars of the third and fourth magnitude, save the third,\r\n[alpha], or the Pearl, which is of the second magnitude. This is the\r\nCorona Borealis. It is very easily recognized (Fig. 8).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--To find Arcturus, the Herdsman, and the Northern\r\nCrown.]\r\n\r\nA line drawn from the Pole-Star to Arcturus forms the base of an\r\nequilateral triangle, the apex of which, situated opposite the Great\r\nBear, is occupied by Vega, or [alpha] of the Lyre, a splendid diamond of\r\nideal purity scintillating through the ether. This magnificent star, of\r\nfirst magnitude, is, with Arcturus, the most luminous in our Heavens. It\r\nburns with a white light, in the proximity of the Milky Way, not far\r\nfrom a constellation that is very easily recognized by the arrangement\r\nof its principal stars in the form of a cross. It is named Cygnus, the\r\nBird, or the Swan (Fig. 9), and is easy to find by the Square of\r\nPegasus, and the Milky Way. This figure, the brilliancy of whose\r\nconstituents (of the third and fourth magnitudes) contrasts strongly\r\nwith the pallor of the Milky Way, includes at its extremity at the foot\r\nof the Cross, a superb double star, [beta] or Albirio: [alpha] of Cygnus\r\nis also called Deneb. The first star of which the distance was\r\ncalculated is in this constellation. This little orb of fifth magnitude,\r\nwhich hangs 69,000,000,000,000 kilometers (42,000,000,000,000 miles)\r\nabove our Earth, is the nearest of all the stars to the skies of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--The Swan, Vega, the Eagle.]\r\n\r\nNot far off is the fine Eagle, which spreads its wings in the Milky Way,\r\nand in which the star Altaïr, [alpha], of first magnitude, is situated\r\nbetween its two satellites, [beta] and [gamma].\r\n\r\nThe Constellation of Hercules, toward which the motions of the Sun are\r\nimpelling us, with all the planets of its system, is near the Lyre. Its\r\nprincipal stars can be recognized inside the triangle formed by the\r\nPole-Star, Arcturus, and Vega.\r\n\r\nAll the Constellations described above belong to the Northern\r\nHemisphere. Those nearest the pole are called circumpolar. They revolve\r\nround the pole in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nHaving now learned the Northern Heavens, we must come back to the Sun,\r\nwhich we have left behind us. The Earth revolves round him in a year,\r\nand in consequence he seems to revolve round us, sweeping through a vast\r\ncircle of the celestial sphere. In each year, at the same period, he\r\npasses the same points of the Heavens, in front of the same\r\nconstellations, which are rendered invisible by his light. We know that\r\nthe stars are at a fixed position from the Earth, whatever their\r\ndistance, and that if we do not see them at noon as at midnight, it is\r\nsimply because they are extinguished by the dazzling light of the orb of\r\nday. With the aid of a telescope it is always possible to see the more\r\nbrilliant of them.\r\n\r\nThe Zodiac is the zone of stars traversed by the Sun in the course of a\r\nyear. This word is derived from the Greek _Zodiakos_, which signifies\r\n\"animal,\" and this etymology arose because most of the figures traced\r\non this belt of stars represent animals. The belt is divided into twelve\r\nparts that are called the twelve Signs of the Zodiac, also named by the\r\nancients the \"Houses of the Sun,\" since the Sun visits one of them in\r\neach month. These are the signs, with the primitive characters that\r\ndistinguish them: the Ram [Aries], the Bull [Taurus], the Twins\r\n[Gemini], the Crab [Cancer], the Lion [Leo], the Virgin [Virgo], the\r\nBalance [Libra], the Scorpion [Scorpio], the Archer [Sagittarius], the\r\nGoat [Capricorn], the Water-Carrier [Aquarius], the Fishes [Pisces]. The\r\nsign [Aries] represents the horns of the Ram, [Taurus] the head of the\r\nBull, and so on.\r\n\r\nIf you will now follow me into the Houses of the Sun you will readily\r\nrecognize them again, provided you have a clear picture of the principal\r\nstars of the Northern Heavens. First, you see the Ram, the initial sign\r\nof the Zodiac; because at the epoch at which the actual Zodiac was\r\nfixed, the Sun entered this sign at the vernal equinox, and the equator\r\ncrossed the ecliptic at this point. This constellation, in which the\r\nhorns of the Ram (third magnitude) are the brightest, is situated\r\nbetween Andromeda and the Pleiades. Two thousand years ago, the Ram was\r\nregarded as the symbol of spring; but owing to the secular movement of\r\nthe precession of the equinoxes, the Sun is no longer there on March 21:\r\nhe is in the Fishes.\r\n\r\nTo the left, or east of the Ram, we find the Bull, the head of which\r\nforms a triangle in which burns Aldebaran, of first magnitude, a\r\nmagnificent red star that marks the right eye; and the Hyades,\r\nscintillating pale and trembling, on its forehead. The timid Pleiades,\r\nas we have seen, veil themselves on the shoulder of the Bull--a\r\ncaptivating cluster, of which six stars can be counted with the unaided\r\neye, while several hundred are discovered with the telescope.\r\n\r\nNext the Twins. They are easily recognized by the two fine stars,\r\n[alpha] and [beta], of first magnitude, which mark their heads, and\r\nimmortalize Castor and Pollux, the sons of Jupiter, celebrated for their\r\nindissoluble friendship.\r\n\r\nCancer, the Crab, is the least important sign of the Zodiac. It is\r\ndistinguished only by five stars of fourth and fifth magnitudes,\r\nsituated below the line of Castor and Pollux, and by a pale cluster\r\ncalled Præsepe, the Beehive.\r\n\r\nThe Lion next approaches, superb in his majesty. At his heart is a\r\ngorgeous star of first magnitude, [alpha] or Regulus. This figure forms\r\na grand trapezium of four stars on the celestial sphere.\r\n\r\nThe Virgin exhibits a splendid star of first magnitude; this is Spica,\r\nwhich with Regulus and Arcturus, form a triangle by which this\r\nconstellation can be recognized.\r\n\r\nThe Balance follows the Virgin. Its scales, marked by two stars of\r\nsecond magnitude, are situated a little to the East of Spica.\r\n\r\nWe next come to the eighth constellation of the Zodiac, which is one of\r\nthe most beautiful of this belt of stars. Antares, a red star of first\r\nmagnitude, occupies the heart of the venomous and accursed Scorpion. It\r\nis situated on the prolongation of a line joining Regulus to Spica, and\r\nforms with Vega of the Lyre, and Arcturus of the Herdsman, a great\r\nisosceles triangle, of which this latter star is the apex.\r\n\r\nThe Scorpion, held to be a sign of ill luck, has been prejudicial to the\r\nArcher, which follows it, and traces an oblique trapezium in the sky, a\r\nlittle to the east of Antares. These two southernmost constellations\r\nnever rise much above the horizon for France and England. In fable, the\r\nArcher is Chiron, the preceptor of Jason, Achilles and Æsculapius.\r\n\r\nCapricorn lies to the south of Altaïr, on the prolongation of a line\r\nfrom the Lyre to the Eagle. It is hardly noticeable save for the stars\r\n[alpha] and [beta] of third magnitude, which scintillate on its\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nThe Water-Carrier pours his streams toward the horizon. He is not rich\r\nin stars, exhibiting only three of third magnitude that form a very\r\nflattened triangle.\r\n\r\nLastly the Fishes, concluding sign of the Zodiac, are found to the\r\nsouth of Andromeda and Pegasus. Save for [alpha], of third magnitude,\r\nthis constellation consists of small stars that are hardly visible.\r\n\r\nThese twelve zodiacal constellations will be recognized on examining the\r\nchart (Figs. 10-11).\r\n\r\nWe must now visit the stars of the Southern Heavens, some of which are\r\nequally deserving of admiration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--The Constellations of the Zodiac: summer and\r\nautumn; Capricorn, Archer, Scorpion, Balance, Virgin, Lion.]\r\n\r\nIt should in the first place be noted that the signs of the Zodiac and\r\nthe Southern Constellations are not, like those which are circumpolar,\r\nperpetually visible at all periods of the year. Their visibility depends\r\non the time of year and the hour of the night.[4]\r\n\r\nIn order to admire the fine constellations of the North, as described\r\nabove, we have only to open our windows on a clear summer's evening, or\r\nwalk round the garden in the mysterious light of these inaccessible\r\nsuns, while we look up at the immense fields in which each star is like\r\nthe head of a celestial spear.\r\n\r\nBut the summer is over, autumn is upon us, and then, too soon, comes\r\nwinter clothed in hoar-frost. The days are short and cold, dark and\r\ndreary; but as a compensation the night is much longer, and adorns\r\nherself with her most beautiful jewels, offering us the contemplation of\r\nher inexhaustible treasures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--The Constellations of the Zodiac: winter and\r\nspring; Crab, Twins, Bull, Ram, Fishes, Water-Carrier.]\r\n\r\nFirst, let us do homage to the magnificent Orion, most splendid of all\r\nthe constellations: he advances like a colossal giant, and confronts the\r\nBull.\r\n\r\nThis constellation appears about midnight in November, in the\r\nsouth-eastern Heavens; toward eleven o'clock in December and January,\r\ndue south; about ten in February, in the south-east; about nine in\r\nMarch, and about eight in April, in the west; and then sets below our\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Orion and his celestial companions.]\r\n\r\nIt is indisputably the most striking figure in the sky, and with the\r\nGreat Bear, the most ancient in history, the first that was noticed:\r\nboth are referred to in the ancient texts of China, Chaldea, and Egypt.\r\n\r\nEight principal stars delineate its outline; two are of the first\r\nmagnitude, five of the second, and one of the third (Fig. 12). The most\r\nbrilliant are Betelgeuse ([alpha]) and Rigel ([beta]): the former\r\nmarking the right shoulder of the Colossus as it faces us; the second\r\nthe left foot. The star on the left shoulder is [gamma] or Bellatrix, of\r\nsecond magnitude; that of the right foot, [chi], is almost of the third.\r\nThree stars of second magnitude placed obliquely at equal distances from\r\neach other, the first or highest of which marks the position of the\r\nequatorial line, indicate the Belt or Girdle. These stars, known as the\r\nThree Kings, and by country people as the Rake, assist greatly in the\r\nrecognition of this fine constellation.\r\n\r\nA little below the second star of the Belt, a large white patch, like a\r\nband of fog, the apparent dimensions of which are equal to that of the\r\nlunar disk, is visible to the unaided eye: this is the Nebula of Orion,\r\none of the most magnificent in the entire Heavens. It was discovered in\r\n1656 by Huyghens, who counted twelve stars in the pale cloud. Since that\r\ndate it has been constantly studied and photographed by its many\r\nadmirers, while the giant eye of the telescope discovers in it to-day an\r\ninnumerable multitude of little stars which reveal the existence of an\r\nentire universe in this region.\r\n\r\nOrion is not merely the most imposing of the celestial figures; it is\r\nalso the richest in sidereal wonders. Among these, it exhibits the most\r\ncomplex of all the multiple systems known to us: that of the star\r\n[theta] situated in the celebrated nebula just mentioned. This marvelous\r\nstar, viewed through a powerful telescope, breaks up into six suns,\r\nforming a most remarkable stellar group.\r\n\r\nThis region is altogether one of the most brilliant in the entire\r\nfirmament. We must no longer postpone our homage to the brightest star\r\nin the sky, the magnificent Sirius, which shines on the left below\r\nOrion: it returns every year toward the end of November. This marvelous\r\nstar, of dazzling brilliancy, is the first, [alpha], in the\r\nconstellation of the Great Dog, which forms a quadrilateral, the base of\r\nwhich is adjacent to a triangle erected from the horizon.\r\n\r\nWhen astronomers first endeavored to determine the distance of the\r\nstars, Sirius, which attracted all eyes to its burning fires, was the\r\nparticular object of attention. After long observation, they succeeded\r\nin determining its distance as 92 trillion kilometers (57 trillion\r\nmiles). Light, that radiates through space at a velocity of 300,000\r\nkilometers (186,000 miles) per second, takes no less than ten years to\r\nreach us from this sun, which, nevertheless, is one of our neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe Little Dog, in which Procyon ([alpha], of first magnitude) shines\r\nout, is above its big brother. With the exception of [alpha], it has no\r\nbright stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Winter Constellations.]\r\n\r\nLastly, toward the southern horizon, we must notice the Hydra, Eridanus,\r\nthe Whale, the Southern Fish, the Ship, and the Centaur. This last\r\nconstellation, while invisible to our latitudes, contains the star that\r\nis nearest to the Earth, [alpha], of first magnitude, the distance of\r\nwhich is 40 trillion kilometers (25 trillion miles).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Spring Constellations.]\r\n\r\nThe feet of the Centaur touch the Southern Cross, which is always\r\ninvisible to us, and a little farther down the Southern Pole reigns\r\nover the icy desert of the antarctic regions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Summer Constellations.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Autumn Constellations.]\r\n\r\nIn order to complete the preceding descriptions, we subjoin four charts\r\nrepresenting the aspect of the starry heavens during the evenings of\r\nwinter, spring, summer, and autumn. To make use of these, we must\r\nsuppose them to be placed above our heads, the center marking the\r\nzenith, and the sky descending all round to the horizon. The horizon,\r\ntherefore, bounds these panoramas. Turning the chart in any direction,\r\nand looking at it from north, south, east, or west, we find all the\r\nprincipal stars. The first map (Fig. 13) represents the sky in winter\r\n(January) at 8 P.M.; the second, in spring (April) at 9 P.M.; the third,\r\nin summer (July) at the same hour; the fourth, the sky in autumn\r\n(October) at the same time.\r\n\r\nAnd so, at little cost, we have made one of the grandest and most\r\nbeautiful journeys conceivable. We now have a new country, or, better,\r\nhave learned to see and know our own country, for since the Earth is a\r\nplanet we must all be citizens of the Heavens before we can belong to\r\nsuch or such a nation of our lilliputian world.\r\n\r\nWe must now study this sublime spectacle of the Heavens in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE STARS, SUNS OF THE INFINITE\r\n\r\nA JOURNEY THROUGH SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen from the foregoing summary of the principal Constellations\r\nthat there is great diversity in the brightness of the stars, and that\r\nwhile our eyes are dazzled with the brilliancy of certain orbs, others,\r\non the contrary, sparkle modestly in the azure depths of the night, and\r\nare hardly perceptible to the eye that seeks to plumb the abysses of\r\nImmensity.\r\n\r\nWe have appended the word \"magnitude\" to the names of certain stars, and\r\nthe reader might imagine this to bear some relation to the volume of the\r\norb. But this is not the case.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the observation of stars of varying brilliancy, they have\r\nbeen classified in order of magnitude, according to their apparent\r\nbrightness, and since the dimensions of these distant suns are almost\r\nwholly unknown to us, the most luminous stars were naturally denoted as\r\nof first magnitude, those which were a little less bright of the second,\r\nand so on. But in reality this word \"magnitude\" is quite erroneous, for\r\nit bears no relation to the mass of the stars, divided thus at an epoch\r\nwhen it was supposed that the most brilliant must be the largest. It\r\nsimply indicates the apparent brightness of a star, the real brilliancy\r\ndepending on its dimensions, its intrinsic light, and its distance from\r\nour planet.\r\n\r\nAnd now to make some comparison between the different orders. Throughout\r\nthe entire firmament, only nineteen stars of first magnitude are\r\ndiscoverable. And, strictly speaking, the last of this series might just\r\nas well be noted of \"second magnitude,\" while the first of the second\r\nseries might be added to the list of stars of the \"first order.\" But in\r\norder to form classes distinct from one another, some limit has to be\r\nadopted, and it was determined that the first series should include only\r\nthe following stars, the most luminous in the Heavens, which are\r\nsubjoined in order of decreasing brilliancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE\r\n\r\n           1. Sirius, or [alpha] of the Great Dog.\r\n           2. Canopus, or [alpha] of the Ship.\r\n           3. Capella, or [alpha] of the Charioteer.\r\n           4. Arcturus, or [alpha] of the Herdsman.\r\n           5. Vega, or [alpha] of the Lyre.\r\n           6. Proxima, or [alpha] of the Centaur.\r\n           7. Rigel, or [beta] of Orion.\r\n           8. Achernar, or [alpha] of Eridanus.\r\n           9. Procyon, or [alpha] of the Little Dog.\r\n          10. [beta] of the Centaur.\r\n          11. Betelgeuse, or [alpha] of Orion.\r\n          12. Altaïr, or [alpha] of the Eagle.\r\n          13. [alpha] of the Southern Cross.\r\n          14. Aldebaran, or [alpha] of the Bull.\r\n          15. Spica, or [alpha] of the Virgin.\r\n          16. Antares, or [alpha] of the Scorpion.\r\n          17. Pollux, or [beta] of the Twins.\r\n          18. Regulus, or [alpha] of the Lion.\r\n          19. Fomalhaut, or [alpha] of the Southern Fish.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STARS OF THE SECOND MAGNITUDE\r\n\r\nThen come the stars of the second magnitude, of which there are\r\nfifty-nine. The stars of the Great Bear (with the exception of [delta],\r\nwhich is of third magnitude), the Pole-Star, the chief stars in Orion\r\n(after Rigel and Betelgeuse), of the Lion, of Pegasus, of Andromeda, of\r\nCassiopeia, are of this order. These, with the former, constitute the\r\nprincipal outlines of the constellations visible to us.\r\n\r\nThen follow the third and fourth magnitudes, and so on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following table gives a summary of the series, down to the sixth\r\nmagnitude, which is the limit of visibility for the unaided human eye:\r\n\r\n             19 stars of first magnitude.\r\n             59 of second magnitude.\r\n            182 of third magnitude.\r\n            530 of fourth magnitude.\r\n          1,600 of fifth magnitude.\r\n          4,800 of sixth magnitude.\r\n\r\nThis makes a total of some seven thousand stars visible to the unaided\r\neye. It will be seen that each series is, roughly speaking, three times\r\nas populated as that preceding it; consequently, if we multiply the\r\nnumber of any class by three, we obtain the approximate number of stars\r\nthat make up the class succeeding it.\r\n\r\nSeven thousand stars! It is an imposing figure, when one reflects that\r\nall these lucid points are suns, as enormous as they are potent, as\r\nincandescent as our own (which exceeds the volume of the Earth by more\r\nthan a million times), distant centers of light and heat, exerting their\r\nattraction on unknown systems. And yet it is generally imagined that\r\nmillions of stars are visible in the firmament. This is an illusion;\r\neven the best vision is unable to distinguish stars below the sixth\r\nmagnitude, and ordinary sight is far from discovering all of these.\r\n\r\nAgain, seven thousand stars for the whole Heavens makes only three\r\nthousand five hundred for half the sky. And we can only see one\r\ncelestial hemisphere at a time. Moreover, toward the horizon, the vapor\r\nof the atmosphere veils the little stars of sixth magnitude. In reality,\r\nwe never see at a given moment more than three thousand stars. This\r\nnumber is below that of the population of a small town.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut celestial space is unlimited, and we must not suppose that these\r\nseven thousand stars that fascinate our eyes and enrich our Heavens,\r\nwithout which our nights would be black, dark, and empty,[5] comprise\r\nthe whole of Creation. They only represent the vestibule of the temple.\r\n\r\nWhere our vision is arrested, a larger, more powerful eye, that is\r\ndeveloping from century to century, plunges its analyzing gaze into the\r\nabysses, and reflects back to the insatiable curiosity of science the\r\nlight of the innumerable suns that it discovers. This eye is the lens of\r\nthe optical instruments. Even opera-glasses disclose stars of the\r\nseventh magnitude. A small astronomical objective penetrates to the\r\neighth and ninth orders. More powerful instruments attain the tenth.\r\nThe Heavens are progressively transformed to the eye of the astronomer,\r\nand soon he is able to reckon hundreds of thousands of orbs in the\r\nnight. The evolution continues, the power of the instrument is\r\ndeveloped; and the stars of the eleventh and twelfth magnitudes are\r\ndiscovered successively, and together number four millions. Then follow\r\nthe thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth magnitudes. This is the\r\nsequence:\r\n\r\n           7th magnitude          13,000.\r\n           8th     \"              40,000.\r\n           9th     \"             120,000.\r\n          10th     \"             380,000.\r\n          11th     \"           1,000,000.\r\n          12th     \"           3,000,000.\r\n          13th     \"           9,000,000.\r\n          14th     \"          27,000,000.\r\n          15th     \"          80,000,000.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the most powerful telescopes of the day, reenforced by\r\ncelestial photography, can bring a stream of more than 120 millions of\r\nstars into the scope of our vision.\r\n\r\nThe photographic map of the Heavens now being executed comprises the\r\nfirst fourteen magnitudes, and will give the precise position of some\r\n40,000,000 stars, distributed over 22,054 sheets, forming a sphere 3\r\nmeters 44 centimeters in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe boldest imagination is overwhelmed by these figures, and fails to\r\npicture such millions of suns--formidable and burning globes that roll\r\nthrough space, sweeping their systems along with them. What furnaces are\r\nthere! what unknown lives! what vast immensities!\r\n\r\nAnd again, what enormous distances must separate the stars, to admit of\r\ntheir free revolution in the ether! In what abysses, at what a distance\r\nfrom our terrestrial atom, must these magnificent and dazzling Suns\r\npursue the paths traced for them by Destiny!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf all the stars radiated an equal light, their distances might be\r\ncalculated on the principle that an object appears smaller in proportion\r\nto its distance. But this equality does not exist. The suns were not all\r\ncast in the same mold.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the stars differ widely in size and brightness, and the\r\ndistances that have been measured show that the most brilliant are not\r\nthe nearest. They are scattered through Space at all distances.\r\n\r\nAmong the nearer stars of which it has been found possible to calculate\r\nthe distance, some are found to be of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh,\r\neighth, and even ninth magnitudes, proving that the most brilliant are\r\nnot always the least distant.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, among the beautiful and shining stars with which we made\r\nacquaintance in the last chapter may be cited Sirius, which at a\r\ndistance of 92 trillion kilometers (57 trillion miles) from here still\r\ndazzles us with its burning fires; Procyon or [alpha] of the Little Dog,\r\nas remote as 112 trillion kilometers (69-1/2 trillion miles); Altaïr of\r\nthe Eagle, at 160 trillion kilometers (99 trillion miles); the white\r\nVega, at 204 trillion kilometers (126-1/2 trillion miles); Capella, at\r\n276 trillion kilometers (171 trillion miles); and the Pole-Star at 344\r\ntrillion kilometers (213-1/2 trillion miles). The light that flies\r\nthrough Space at a velocity of 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per\r\nsecond, takes thirty-six years and a half to reach us from this distant\r\nsun: _i.e._, the luminous ray we are now receiving from Polaris has been\r\ntraveling for more than the third of a century. When you, gentle reader,\r\nwere born, the ray that arrives to-day from the Pole-Star was already\r\nspeeding on its way. In the first second after it had started it\r\ntraveled 300,000 kilometers; in the second it added another 300,000\r\nwhich at once makes 600,000 kilometers; add another 300,000 kilometers\r\nfor the third second, and so on during the thirty-six years and a half.\r\n\r\nIf we tried to arrange the number 300,000 (which represents the distance\r\naccomplished in one second) in superposed rows, as if for an addition\r\nsum, as many times as is necessary to obtain the distance that\r\nseparates the Pole-Star from our Earth, the necessary operation would\r\ncomprise 1,151,064,000 rows, and the sheet of paper required for the\r\nsetting out of such a sum would measure approximately 11,510 kilometers\r\n(about 7,000 miles), _i.e._, almost the diameter of our terrestrial\r\nglobe, or about four times the distance from Paris to Moscow!\r\n\r\nIs it not impossible to realize that our Sun, with its entire system, is\r\nlost in the Heavens at such a distance from his peers in Space? At the\r\ndistance of the least remote of the stars he would appear as one of the\r\nsmallest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe nearest star to us is [alpha] of the Centaur, of first magnitude, a\r\nneighbor of the South Pole, invisible in our latitudes. Its distance is\r\n275,000 radii of the terrestrial orbit, _i.e._, 275,000 times 149\r\nmillion kilometers, which gives 41 trillions, or 41,000 milliards of\r\nkilometers (= 25-1/2 trillion miles). [A milliard = 1,000 millions, the\r\nFrench billion. A trillion = 1,000 milliards, or a million millions, the\r\nEnglish billion. The _French_ nomenclature has been retained by the\r\ntranslator.] At a speed of 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second\r\nthe light takes four years to come from thence. It is a fine double\r\nstar.\r\n\r\nThe next nearest star after this is a little orb invisible to the\r\nunaided eye. It has no name, and stands as No. 21,185 in the Catalogue\r\nof Lalande. It almost attains the seventh magnitude (6.8). Its distance\r\nis 64 trillion kilometers (39-1/2 trillion miles).\r\n\r\nThe third of which the distance has been measured is the small star in\r\nCygnus, already referred to in Chapter II, in describing the\r\nConstellations. Its distance is 69 trillion kilometers (42-1/2 trillion\r\nmiles). This, too, is a double star. The light takes seven years to\r\nreach us.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the fine stars Sirius, Procyon, Aldebaran, Altaïr,\r\nVega, and Capella are more remote.\r\n\r\nOur solar system is thus very isolated in the vastness of Infinitude.\r\nThe latest known planet of our system, Neptune, performs its revolutions\r\nin space at 4 milliards, 470 million kilometers (2,771,400,000 miles)\r\nfrom our Sun. Even this is a respectable distance! But beyond this\r\nworld, an immense gulf, almost a void abyss, extends to the nearest\r\nstar, [alpha] of the Centaur. Between Neptune and Centauris there is no\r\nstar to cheer the black and cold solitude of the immense vacuum. One or\r\ntwo unknown planets, some wandering comets, and swarms of meteors,\r\ndoubtless traverse those unknown spaces, but all invisible to us.\r\n\r\nLater on we will discuss the methods that have been employed in\r\nmeasuring these distances. Let us now continue our description.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow that we have some notion of the distance of the stars we must\r\napproach them with the telescope, and compare them one with another.\r\n\r\nLet us, for example, get close to Sirius: in this star we admire a sun\r\nthat is several times heavier than our own, and of much greater mass,\r\naccompanied by a second sun that revolves round it in fifty years. Its\r\nlight is exceedingly white, and it notably burns with hydrogen flames,\r\nlike Vega and Altaïr.\r\n\r\nNow let us approach Arcturus, Capella, Aldebaran: these are yellow stars\r\nwith golden rays, like our Sun, and the vapor of iron, of sodium, and of\r\nmany other metals can be identified in their spectrum. These stars are\r\nolder than the first, and the ruddy ones, such as Antares, Betelgeuse,\r\n[alpha] of Hercules, are still older; several of them are variable, and\r\nare on their way to final extinction.\r\n\r\nThe Heavens afford us a perennial store of treasure, wherein the\r\nthinker, poet or artist can find inexhaustible subjects of\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\nYou have heard of the celestial jewels, the diamonds, rubies, emeralds,\r\nsapphires, topazes, and other precious stones of the sidereal casket.\r\nThese marvels are met with especially among the double stars.\r\n\r\nOur Sun, white and solitary, gives no idea of the real aspect of some of\r\nits brothers in Infinitude. There are as many different types as there\r\nare suns!\r\n\r\nStars, you will think, are like individuals: each has its distinct\r\ncharacteristics: no two are comparable. And indeed this reflection is\r\njustified. While human vanity does homage to Phoebus, divine King of\r\nthe Heavens, other suns of still greater magnificence form groups of two\r\nor three splendid orbs, which roll the prodigious combinations of their\r\ndouble, triple, or multiple systems through space, pouring on to the\r\nworlds that accompany them a flood of changing light, now blue, now red,\r\nnow violet, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the inexhaustible variety of Creation there exist Suns that are\r\nunited in pairs, bound by a common destiny, cradled in the same\r\nattraction, and often colored in the most delicate and entrancing shades\r\nconceivable. Here will be a dazzling ruby, its glowing color shedding\r\njoy; there a deep blue sapphire of tender tone; beyond, the finest\r\nemeralds, hue of hope. Diamonds of translucent purity and whiteness\r\nsparkle from the abyss, and shed their penetrating light into the vast\r\nspace. What splendors are scattered broadcast over the sky! what\r\nprofusion!\r\n\r\nTo the naked eye, the groups appear like ordinary stars, mere luminous\r\npoints of greater or less brilliancy; but the telescope soon discovers\r\nthe beauty of these systems; the star is duplicated into two distinct\r\nsuns, in close proximity. These groups of two or several suns are not\r\nmerely due to an effect of perspective--_i.e._, the presence of two or\r\nmore stars in our line of sight; as a rule they constitute real physical\r\nsystems, and these suns, associated in a common lot, rotate round one\r\nanother in a more or less rapid period, that varies for each system.\r\n\r\nOne of the most splendid of these _double stars_, and at the same time\r\none of the easiest to perceive, is [zeta] in the Great Bear, or Mizar,\r\nmentioned above in describing this constellation. It has no contrasting\r\ncolors, but exactly resembles twin diamonds of the finest water, which\r\nfascinate the gaze, even through a small objective.\r\n\r\nIts components are of the second and fourth magnitudes, their distance =\r\n14\"[6]. Some idea of their appearance in a small telescope may be\r\nobtained from the subjoined figure (Fig. 17).\r\n\r\nAnother very brilliant pair is Castor. Magnitudes second and third.\r\nDistance 5.6\"\". Very easy to observe. [gamma] in the Virgin resolves\r\ninto two splendid diamonds of third magnitude. Distance, 5.0\". Another\r\ndouble star is [gamma] of the Ram, of fourth magnitude. Distance, 8.9\".\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--The double star Mizar.]\r\n\r\nAnd here are two that are even more curious by reason of their coloring:\r\n[gamma] in Andromeda, composed of a fine orange star, and one\r\nemerald-green, which again is accompanied by a tiny comrade of the\r\ndeepest blue. This group in a good telescope is most attractive.\r\nMagnitudes, second and fifth. Distance, 10\".\r\n\r\n[beta] of the Swan, or Albireo, referred to in the last chapter, has\r\nbeen analyzed into two stars: one golden-yellow, the other sapphire.\r\nMagnitudes, third and fifth. Distance, 34\". [alpha] of the Greyhounds,\r\nknown also as the Heart of Charles II, is golden-yellow and lilac.\r\nMagnitudes, third and fifth. Distance 20\".[7]\r\n\r\n[alpha] of Hercules revolves a splendid emerald and a ruby in the skies;\r\n[zeta] of the Lyre exhibits a yellow and a green star; Rigel, an\r\nelectric sun, and a small sapphire; Antares is ruddy and emerald-green;\r\n[eta] of Perseus resolves into a burning red star, and one smaller that\r\nis deep blue, and so on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese exquisite double stars revolve in gracious and splendid couples\r\naround one another, as in some majestic valse, marrying their\r\nmulti-colored fires in the midst of the starry firmament.\r\n\r\nHere, we constantly receive a pure and dazzling white light from our\r\nburning luminary. Its ray, indeed, contains the potentiality of every\r\nconceivable color, but picture the fantastic illumination of the worlds\r\nthat gravitate round these multiple and colored suns as they shed floods\r\nof blue and roseate, red, or orange light around them! What a fairy\r\nspectacle must life present upon these distant universes!\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that we inhabit a planet illuminated by two suns, one\r\nblue, the other red.\r\n\r\nIt is morning. The sapphire sun climbs slowly up the Heavens, coloring\r\nthe atmosphere with a somber and almost melancholy hue. The blue disk\r\nattains the zenith, and is beginning its descent toward the West, when\r\nthe East lights up with the flames of a scarlet sun, which in its turn\r\nascends the heights of the firmament. The West is plunged in the\r\npenumbra of the rays of the blue sun, while the East is illuminated with\r\nthe purple and burning rays of the ruby orb.\r\n\r\nThe first sun is setting when the second noon shines for the inhabitants\r\nof this strange world. But the red sun, too, accomplishes the law of its\r\ndestiny. Hardly has it disappeared in the conflagration of its last\r\nrays, with which the West is flushed, when the blue orb reappears on the\r\nopposite side, shedding a pale azure light upon the world it\r\nilluminates, which knows no night. And thus these two suns fraternize in\r\nthe Heavens over the common task of renewing a thousand effects of\r\nextra-terrestrial light for the globes that are subject to their\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nScarlet, indigo, green, and golden suns; pearly and multi-colored Moons;\r\nare these not fairy visions, dazzling to our poor sight, condemned while\r\nhere below to see and know but one white Sun?\r\n\r\nAs we have learned, there are not only double, but triple, and also\r\nmultiple stars. One of the finest ternary systems is that of [gamma] in\r\nAndromeda, above mentioned. Its large star is orange, its second green,\r\nits third blue, but the two last are in close juxtaposition, and a\r\npowerful telescope is needed to separate them. A triple star more easy\r\nto observe is [zeta] of Cancer, composed of three orbs of fifth\r\nmagnitude, at a distance of 1\" and 5\"; the first two revolve round their\r\ncommon center of gravity in fifty-nine years, the third takes over three\r\nhundred years. The preceding figure shows this system in a fairly\r\npowerful objective (Fig. 18).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Triple star [zeta] in Cancer.]\r\n\r\nIn the Lyre, a little above the dazzling Vega, [epsilon] is of fourth\r\nmagnitude, which seems a little elongated to the unaided eye, and can\r\neven be analyzed into two contiguous stars by very sharp sight. But on\r\nexamining this attractive pair with a small glass, it is further obvious\r\nthat each of these stars is double; so that they form a splendid\r\nquadruple system of two couples (Fig. 19): one of fifth and a half and\r\nsixth magnitudes, at a distance of 2.4\", the other of sixth and\r\nseventh, 3.2\" distant. The distance between the two pairs is 207\".\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Quadruple star [epsilon] of the Lyre.]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of Orion, we referred to the marvelous star [theta] situated\r\nin the no less famous Nebula, below the Belt; this star forms a\r\ndazzling sextuple system, in the very heart of the nebula (Fig. 20). How\r\ndifferent to our Sun, sailing through Space in modest isolation!\r\n\r\nBe it noted that all these stars are animated by prodigious motions that\r\nimpel them in every direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Sextuple star [theta] in the Nebula of Orion.]\r\n\r\nThere are no fixed stars. On every side throughout Infinity, the burning\r\nsuns--enormous globes, blazing centers of light and heat--are flying at\r\ngiddy speed toward an unknown goal, traversing millions of miles each\r\nday, crossing century by century such vast spaces as are inconceivable\r\nto the human intellect.\r\n\r\nIf the stars appear motionless to us, it is because they are so remote,\r\ntheir secular movements being only manifested on the celestial sphere by\r\nimperceptible displacements. But in reality these suns are in perpetual\r\ncommotion in the abysses of the Heavens, which they quicken with an\r\nextraordinary animation.\r\n\r\nThese perpetual and cumulative motions must eventually modify the aspect\r\nof the Constellations: but these changes will only take effect very\r\nslowly; and for thousands and thousands of years longer the heroes and\r\nheroines of mythology will keep their respective places in the Heavens,\r\nand reign undisturbed beneath the starry vault.\r\n\r\nExamination of these star motions reveals the fact that our Sun is\r\nplunging with all his system (the Earth included) toward the\r\nConstellation of Hercules. We are changing our position every moment: in\r\nan hour we shall be 70,000 kilometers (43,500 miles) farther than we are\r\nat present. The Sun and the Earth will never again traverse the space\r\nthey have just left, and which they have deserted forever.\r\n\r\nAnd here let us pause for an instant to consider the _variable stars_.\r\nOur Sun, which is constant and uniform in its light, does not set the\r\ntype of all the stars. A great number of them are variable--either\r\nperiodically, in regular cycles--or irregularly.\r\n\r\nWe are already acquainted with the variations of Algol, in Perseus, due\r\nto its partial eclipse by a dark globe gravitating in the line of our\r\nvision. There are several others of the same type: these are not,\r\nproperly speaking, variable stars. But there are many others the\r\nintrinsic light of which undergoes actual variations.\r\n\r\nIn order to realize this, let us imagine that our Earth belongs to such\r\na sun, for example, to a star in the southern constellation of the\r\nWhale, indicated by the letter [omicron], which has been named the\r\n\"wonderful\" (Mira Ceti). Our new sun is shining to-day with a dazzling\r\nlight, shedding the gladness of his joyous beams upon nature and in our\r\nhearts. For two months we admire the superb orb, sparkling in the azure\r\nilluminated with its radiance. Then of a sudden, its light fades, and\r\ndiminishes in intensity, though the sky remains clear. Imperceptibly,\r\nour fine sun darkens; the atmosphere becomes sad and dull, there is an\r\nanticipation of universal death. For five long months our world is\r\nplunged in a kind of penumbra; all nature is saddened in the general\r\nwoe.\r\n\r\nBut while we are bewailing the cruelty of our lot, our cherished\r\nluminary revives. The intensity of its light increases slowly. Its\r\nbrilliancy augments, and finally, at the end of three months, it has\r\nrecovered its former splendors, and showers its bright beams upon our\r\nworld, flooding it with joy. But--we must not rejoice too quickly! This\r\nsplendid blaze will not endure. The flaming star will pale once more;\r\nfade back to its minimum; and then again revive. Such is the nature of\r\nthis capricious sun. It varies in three hundred and thirty-one days, and\r\nfrom yellow at the maximum, turns red at the minimum. This star, Mira\r\nCeti, which is one of the most curious of its type, varies from the\r\nsecond to the ninth magnitudes: we cite it as one example; hundreds of\r\nothers might be instanced.\r\n\r\nThus the sky is no black curtain dotted with brilliant points, no empty\r\ndesert, silent and monotonous. It is a prodigious theater on which the\r\nmost fantastic plays are continually being acted. Only--there are no\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\nAgain, we must note the _temporary stars_, which shine for a certain\r\ntime, and then die out rapidly. Such was the star in Cassiopeia, in\r\n1572, the light of which exceeded Sirius in its visibility in full\r\ndaylight, burning for five months with unparalleled splendor, dominating\r\nall other stars of first magnitude; after which it died out gradually,\r\ndisappearing at the end of seventeen months, to the terror of the\r\npeoples, who saw in it the harbinger of the world's end: that of 1604,\r\nin the Constellation of the Serpent, which shone for a year; of 1866, of\r\nsecond magnitude, in the Northern Crown, which appeared for a few weeks\r\nonly; of 1876, in the Swan; of 1885, in the Nebula of Andromeda; of\r\n1891, in the Charioteer; and quite recently, of 1901, in Perseus.\r\n\r\nThese temporary stars, which appear spontaneously to the observers on\r\nthe Earth, and quickly vanish again, are doubtless due to collisions,\r\nconflagrations, or celestial cataclysms. But we only see them long after\r\nthe epoch at which the phenomena occurred, years upon years, and\r\ncenturies ago. For instance, the conflagration photographed by the\r\nauthor in 1901, in Perseus, must have occurred in the time of Queen\r\nElizabeth. It has taken all this time for the rays of light to reach us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Heavens are full of surprises, on which we can bestow but a fleeting\r\nglance within these limits. They present a field of infinite variety.\r\n\r\nWho has not noticed the Milky Way, the pale belt that traverses the\r\nentire firmament and is so luminous on clear evenings in the\r\nConstellations of the Swan and the Lyre? It is indeed a swarm of stars.\r\nEach is individually too small to excite our retina, but as a whole,\r\ncuriously enough, they are perfectly visible. With opera-glasses we\r\ndivine the starry constitution: a small telescope shows us marvels.\r\nEighteen millions of stars were counted there with the gauges of William\r\nHerschel.\r\n\r\nNow this Milky Way is a symbol, not of the Universe, but of the\r\nUniverses that succeed each other through the vast spaces to Infinity.\r\n\r\nOur Sun is a star of the Milky Way. It surrounds us like a great circle,\r\nand if the Earth were transparent, we should see it pass beneath our\r\nfeet as well as over our heads. It consists of a very considerable mass\r\nof star-clusters, varying greatly in extent and number, some projected\r\nin front of others, while the whole forms an agglomeration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--The Star-Cluster in Hercules.]\r\n\r\nAmong this mass of star-groups, several thousands of which are already\r\nknown to us, we will select one of the most curious, the Cluster in\r\nHercules, which can be distinguished with the unaided eye, between the\r\nstars [eta] and [zeta] of that constellation. Many photographs of it\r\nhave been taken in the author's observatory at Juvisy, showing some\r\nthousands of stars; and one of these is reproduced in the accompanying\r\nfigure (Fig. 21). Is it not a veritable universe?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--The Star-Cluster in the Centaur.]\r\n\r\nAnother of the most beautiful, on account of its regularity, is that of\r\nthe Centaur (Fig. 22).\r\n\r\nThese groups often assume the most extraordinary shapes in the\r\ntelescope, such as crowns, fishes, crabs, open mouths, birds with\r\noutspread wings, etc.\r\n\r\nWe must also note the _gaseous nebulæ_, universes in the making,\r\n_e.g._, the famous Nebula in Orion, of which we obtained some notion a\r\nwhile ago in connection with its sextuple star: and also that in\r\nAndromeda (Fig. 23).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--The Nebula in Andromeda.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Nebula in the Greyhounds.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most marvelous of all is that of the Greyhounds, which\r\nevolves in gigantic spirals round a dazzling focus, and then loses\r\nitself far off in the recesses of space. Fig. 24 gives a picture of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--The Pleiades.]\r\n\r\nWithout going thus far, and penetrating into telescopic depths, my\r\nreaders can get some notion of these star-clusters with the help of a\r\nsmall telescope or opera-glasses, or even with the unaided eye, by\r\nlooking at the beautiful group of the Pleiades, already familiar to us\r\non another page, and using it as a test of vision. The little map\r\nsubjoined (Fig. 25) will be an assistance in recognizing them, and in\r\nestimating their magnitudes, which are in the following order:\r\n\r\n          Alcyone    3.0.\r\n          Electra    4.5.\r\n          Atlas      4.6.\r\n          Maia       5.0.\r\n          Merope     5.5.\r\n          Taygeta    5.8.\r\n          Pleione    6.3.\r\n          Celæno     6.5.\r\n          Asterope   6.8.\r\n\r\nGood eyes distinguish the first six, sharp sight detects the three\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIn the times of the ancient Greeks, seven were accounted of equal\r\nbrilliancy, and the poets related that the seventh star had fled at the\r\ntime of the Trojan War. Ovid adds that she was mortified at not being\r\nembraced by a god, as were her six sisters. It is probable that only the\r\nbest sight could then distinguish Pleione, as in our own day. The\r\nangular distance from Atlas to Pleione is 5'.\r\n\r\nThe length of this republic, from Atlas and Pleione to Celæno, is 4'/23\"\r\nof time, or 1°6' of arc; the breadth, from Merope to Asterope, is\r\n36'.[8]\r\n\r\nIn the quadrilateral, the length from Alcyone to Electra is 36', and the\r\nbreadth from Merope to Maia 25'. To us it appears as though, if the Full\r\nMoon were placed in front of this group of nine stars, she would cover\r\nit entirely, for to the naked eye she appears much larger than all the\r\nPleiades together. But this is not so. She only measures 31', less than\r\nhalf the distance from Atlas to Celæno; she is hardly broader than the\r\ndistance from Alcyone to Atlas, and could pass between Merope and\r\nTaygeta without touching either of these stars. This is a perennial and\r\nvery curious optical illusion. When the Moon passes in front of the\r\nPleiades, and occults them successively, it is hard to believe one's\r\neyes. The fact occurred, _e.g._, on July 23, 1897, during a fine\r\noccultation observed at the author's laboratory of Juvisy (Fig. 26).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Occultation of the Pleiades by the Moon.]\r\n\r\nPhotography here discovers to us, not 6, 9, 12, 15, or 20 stars, but\r\nhundreds and millions.\r\n\r\nThese are the most brilliant flowers of the celestial garden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Stellar dial of the double star [gamma] of the\r\nVirgin.]\r\n\r\nWe, alas, can but glance at them rapidly. In contemplating them we are\r\ntransported into immensities both of space and time, for the stellar\r\nperiods measured by these distant universes often overpower in their\r\nmagnitude the rapid years in which our terrestrial days are estimated.\r\nFor instance, one of the double stars we spoke of above, [gamma] of the\r\nVirgin, sees its two components, translucent diamonds, revolve around\r\ntheir common center of gravity, in one hundred and eighty years. How\r\nmany events took place in France, let us say, in a single year of this\r\nstar!--The Regency, Louis XV, Louis XVI, the Revolution, Napoleon, Louis\r\nXVIII, Louis Philippe, the Second Republic, Napoleon III, the\r\nFranco-German War, the Third Republic.... What revolutions here, during\r\na single year of this radiant pair! (Fig. 27.)\r\n\r\nBut the pageant of the Heavens is too vast, too overwhelming. We must\r\nend our survey.\r\n\r\nOur Milky Way, with its millions of stars, represents for us only a\r\nportion of the Creation. The illimitable abysses of Infinitude are\r\npeopled by other universes as vast, as imposing, as our own, which are\r\nrenewed in all directions through the depths of Space to endless\r\ndistance. Where is our little Earth? Where our Solar System? We are fain\r\nto fold our wings, and return from the Immense and Infinite to our\r\nfloating island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nOUR STAR THE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the incessant agitation of daily life in which we are involved by the\r\nthousand superfluous wants of modern \"civilization,\" one is prone to\r\nassume that existence is complete only when it reckons to the good an\r\nincalculable number of petty incidents, each more insignificant than the\r\nlast. Why lose time in thinking or dreaming? We must live at fever heat,\r\nmust agitate, and be infatuated for inanities, must create imaginary\r\ndesires and torments.\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful mind, prone to contemplation and admiration of the\r\nbeauties of Nature, is ill at ease in this perpetual vortex that\r\nswallows everything--satisfaction, in a life that one has not time to\r\nrelish; love of the beautiful, that one views with indifference; it is a\r\nwhirlpool that perpetually hides Truth from us, forgotten forever at the\r\nbottom of her well.\r\n\r\nAnd why are our lives thus absorbed in merely material interests? To\r\nsatisfy our pride and vanity! To make ourselves slaves to chimeras! If\r\nthe Moon were inhabited, and if her denizens could see us plainly\r\nenough to note and analyze the details of human existence on the surface\r\nof our planet, it would be curious and perhaps a little humiliating for\r\nus, to see their statistics. What! we should say, is this the sum of our\r\nlives? Is it for this that we struggle, and suffer, and die? Truly it is\r\nfutile to give ourselves such trouble.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the remedy is simple, within the power of every one; but one\r\ndoes not think of it just because it is too easy, although it has the\r\nimmense advantage of lifting us out of the miseries of this weary world\r\ntoward the inexpressible happiness that must always awaken in us with\r\nthe knowledge of the Truth: we need only open our eyes to see, and to\r\nlook out. Only--one hardly ever thinks of it, and it is easier to let\r\none's self be blinded by the illusion and false glamor of appearances.\r\n\r\nThink what it would be to consecrate an hour each day to voluntary\r\nparticipation in the harmonious Choir of Nature, to raise one's eyes\r\ntoward the Heavens, to share the lessons taught by the Pageant of the\r\nUniverse! But, no: there is no time, no time for the intellectual life,\r\nno time to become attached to real interests, no time to pursue them.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects marshaled for us in the immense spectacle of Nature,\r\nnothing without exception has struck the admiration and attention of\r\nman as much as the Sun, the God of Light, the fecundating orb, without\r\nwhich our planet and its life would never have issued from nonentity,\r\n_the visible image of the invisible god_, as said Cicero, and the poets\r\nof antiquity. And yet how many beyond the circle of those likely to read\r\nthese pages know that this Sun is a star in the Milky Way, and that\r\nevery star is a sun? How many take any account of the reality and\r\ngrandeur of the Universe? Inquire, and you will find that the number of\r\npeople who have any notion, however rudimentary, of its construction, is\r\nsingularly restricted. Humanity is content to vegetate, much after the\r\nfashion of a race of moles.\r\n\r\nHenceforward, you will know that you are living in the rays of a star,\r\nwhich, from its proximity, we term a sun. To the inhabitants of other\r\nsystems of worlds, our splendid Sun is only a more or less brilliant,\r\nluminous point, according as the spot from which it is observed is\r\nnearer or farther off. But to us its \"terrestrial\" importance renders it\r\nparticularly precious; we forget all the sister stars on its account,\r\nand even the most ignorant hail it with enthusiasm without exactly\r\nknowing what its rôle in the universe may be, simply because they feel\r\nthat they depend on it, and that without it life would become extinct on\r\nthis globe. Yes, it is the beneficent rays of the Sun that shed upon\r\nour Earth the floods of light and heat to which Life owes its existence\r\nand its perpetual propagation.\r\n\r\nHail, vast Sun! a little star in Infinitude, but for us a colossal and\r\nportentous luminary. Hail, divine Benefactor! How should we not adore,\r\nwhen we owe him the glow of the warm and cheery days of summer, the\r\ngentle caresses by which his rays touch the undulating ears, and gild\r\nthem with the touch? The Sun sustains our globe in Space, and keeps it\r\nwithin his rays by the mysteriously powerful and delicate cords of\r\nattraction. It is the Sun that we inhale from the embalmed corollas of\r\nthe flowers that uplift their gracious heads toward his light, and\r\nreflect his splendors back to us. It is the Sun that sparkles in the\r\nfoam of the merry wine; that charms our gaze in those first days of\r\nspring, when the home of the human race is adorned with all the charms\r\nof verdant and flowering youth. Everywhere we find the Sun; everywhere\r\nwe recognize his work, extending from the infinitely great to the\r\ninfinitely little. We bow to his might, and admire his power. When in\r\nthe sad winter day he disappears behind the snowy eaves, we think his\r\nfiery globe will never rise to mitigate the short December days which\r\nare alleviated with his languid beams.\r\n\r\nApril restores him to superb majesty, and our hearts are filled with\r\nhope in the illumination of those beauteous, sunny hours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur celestial journey carried us far indeed from our own Solar System.\r\nGuided by the penetrating eye of the telescope, we reached such distant\r\ncreations that we lost sight of our cherished luminary.\r\n\r\nBut we remember that he burns yonder, in the midst of the pale cosmic\r\ncloud we term the Milky Way. Let us approach him, now that we have\r\nvisited the Isles of Light in the Celestial Ocean; let us traverse the\r\nvast plains strewn with the burning gold of the Suns of the Infinite.\r\n\r\nWe embark upon a ray of light, and glide rapidly to the portals of our\r\nUniverse. Soon we perceive a tiny speck, scintillating feebly in the\r\ndepths of Space, and recognize it as our own celestial quarters. This\r\nlittle star shines like the head of a gold pin, and increases in size as\r\nwe advance toward it. We traverse a few more trillion miles in our rapid\r\ncourse, and it shines out like a fine star of the first magnitude. It\r\ngrows larger and larger. Soon we divine that it is our humble Earth that\r\nis shining before us, and gladly alight upon her. In future we shall not\r\nquit our own province of the Celestial Kingdom, but will enter into\r\nrelations with this solar family, which interests us the more in that it\r\naffects us so closely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Comparative sizes of the Sun and Earth.]\r\n\r\nThe Sun, which is manifested to us as a fine white disk at noon, while\r\nit is fiery red in the evening, at its setting, is an immense globe,\r\nwhose colossal dimensions surpass those of our terrestrial atom beyond\r\nall conceivable proportion.\r\n\r\nIn diameter, it is, in effect, 108-1/2 times as large as the Earth; that\r\nis to say, if our planet be represented by a globe 1 meter in diameter,\r\nthe Sun would figure as a sphere 108-1/2 meters across. This is shown on\r\nthe accompanying figure (Fig. 28), which is in exact proportion.\r\n\r\nIf our world were set down upon the Sun, with all its magnificence, all\r\nits wealth, its mountains, its seas, its monuments, and its inhabitants,\r\nit would only be an imperceptible speck. It would occupy less space in\r\nthe central orb than one grain in a grenade. If the Earth were placed in\r\nthe center of the Sun, with the Moon still revolving round it at her\r\nproper distance of 384,000 kilometers (238,500 miles), only half the\r\nsolar surface would be covered.\r\n\r\nIn volume the Sun is 1,280,000 times vaster than our abode, and 324,000\r\ntimes heavier in mass. That the giant only appears to us as a small\r\nthough very brilliant disk, is solely on account of its distance. Its\r\napparent dimensions by no means reveal its majestic proportions to us.\r\n\r\nWhen observed with astronomical instruments, or photographed, we\r\ndiscover that its surface is not smooth, as might be supposed, but\r\ngranulated, presenting a number of luminous points dispersed over a\r\nmore somber background. These granulations are somewhat like the pores\r\nof a fruit, _e.g._, a fine orange, the color of which recalls the hue of\r\nthe Sun when it sinks in the evening, and prepares to plunge us into\r\ndarkness. At times these pores open under the influence of disturbances\r\nthat arise upon the solar surface, and give birth to a Sun-Spot. For\r\ncenturies scientists and lay people alike refused to admit the existence\r\nof these spots, regarding them as so many blemishes upon the King of the\r\nHeavens. Was not the Sun the emblem of inviolable purity? To find any\r\ndefect in him were to do him grievous injury. Since the orb of day was\r\nincorruptible, those who threw doubt on his immaculate splendor were\r\nfools and idiots. And so when Scheiner, one of the first who studied the\r\nsolar spots with the telescope, published the result of his experiments\r\nin 1610, no one would believe his statements.\r\n\r\nYet, from the observations of Galileo and other astronomers, it became\r\nnecessary to accept the evidence, and stranger still to recognize that\r\nit is by these very spots that we are enabled to study the physical\r\nconstitution of the Sun.\r\n\r\nThey are generally rounded or oval in shape, and exhibit two distinct\r\nparts; first, the central portion, which is black, and is called the\r\n_nucleus_, or _umbra_; second, a clearer region, half shaded, which has\r\nreceived the name of _penumbra_. These parts are sharply defined in\r\noutline; the penumbra is gray, the nucleus looks black in relation to\r\nthe dazzling brilliancy of the solar surface; but as a matter of fact it\r\nradiates a light 2,000 times superior in intensity to that of the full\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Direct photograph of the Sun.]\r\n\r\nSome idea of the aspect of these spots may be obtained from the\r\naccompanying reproduction of a photograph of the Sun (taken September 8,\r\n1898, at the author's observatory at Juvisy), and from the detailed\r\ndrawing of the large spot that broke out some days later (September 13),\r\ncrossed by a bridge, and furrowed with flames. As a rule, the spots\r\nundergo rapid transformations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Telescopic aspect of a Sun-Spot.]\r\n\r\nThese spots, which appear of insignificant dimensions to the observers\r\non the Earth, are in reality absolutely gigantic. Some that have been\r\nmeasured are ten times as large as the Earth's diameter, _i.e._, 120,000\r\nkilometers (74,500 miles).\r\n\r\nSometimes the spots are so large that they can be seen with the unaided\r\neye (protected with black or dark-blue glasses). They are not formed\r\ninstantaneously, but are heralded by a vast commotion on the solar\r\nsurface, exhibiting, as it were, luminous waves or _faculæ_. Out of this\r\nagitation arises a little spot, that is usually round, and enlarges\r\nprogressively to reach a maximum, after which it diminishes, with\r\nfrequent segmentation and shrinkage. Some are visible only for a few\r\ndays; others last for months. Some appear, only to be instantly\r\nswallowed in the boiling turmoil of the flaming orb. Sometimes, again,\r\nwhite incandescent waves emerge, and seem to throw luminous bridges\r\nacross the central umbra. As a rule the spots are not very profound.\r\nThey are funnel-shaped depressions, inferior in depth to the diameter of\r\nthe Earth, which, as we have seen, is 108 times smaller than that of the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Sun-Spots are not devoid of motion, and from their movements we\r\nlearn that the radiant orb revolves upon itself in about twenty-five\r\ndays. This rotation was determined in 1611, by Galileo, who, while\r\nobserving the spots, saw that they traversed the solar disk from east\r\nto west, following lines that are oblique to the plane of the ecliptic,\r\nand that they disappear at the western border fourteen days after their\r\narrival at the eastern edge. Sometimes the same spot, after being\r\ninvisible for fourteen days, reappears upon the eastern edge, where it\r\nwas observed twenty-eight days previously. It progresses toward the\r\ncenter of the Sun, which is reached in seven days, disappears anew in\r\nthe west, and continues its journey on the hemisphere opposed to us, to\r\nreappear under observation two weeks later, if it has not meantime been\r\nextinguished. This observation proves that the Sun revolves upon itself.\r\nThe reappearance of the spots occurs in about twenty-seven days, because\r\nthe Earth is not stationary, and in its movement round the burning\r\nfocus, a motion effected in the same direction as the solar rotation,\r\nthe spots are still visible two and a half days after they disappeared\r\nfrom the point at which they had been twenty-five days previously. In\r\nreality, the rotation of the Sun occupies twenty-five and a half days,\r\nbut strangely enough this globe _does not rotate in one uniform period_,\r\nlike the Earth; the rotation periods, or movements of the different\r\nparts of the solar surface, diminish from the Sun's equator toward its\r\npoles. The period is twenty-five days at the equator, twenty-six at the\r\ntwenty-fourth degree of latitude, north or south, twenty-seven at the\r\nthirty-seventh degree, twenty-eight at the forty-eighth. The spots are\r\nusually formed between the equator and this latitude, more especially\r\nbetween the tenth and thirtieth degrees. They have never been seen round\r\nthe poles.\r\n\r\nToward the edges of the Sun, again, are very brilliant and highly\r\nluminous regions, which generally surround the spots, and have been\r\ntermed _faculæ_ (_facula_, a little torch). These faculæ, which\r\nfrequently occupy a very extensive surface, seem to be the seat of\r\nformidable commotions that incessantly revolutionize the face of our\r\nmonarch, often, as we said, preceding the spots. They can be detected\r\nright up to the poles.\r\n\r\nOur Sun, that appears so calm and majestic, is in reality the seat of\r\nfierce conflagrations. Volcanic eruptions, the most appalling storms,\r\nthe worst cataclysms that sometimes disturb our little world, are gentle\r\nzephyrs compared with the solar tempests that engender clouds of fire\r\ncapable at one burst of engulfing globes of the dimensions of our\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nTo compare terrestrial volcanoes with solar eruptions is like comparing\r\nthe modest night-light that consumes a midge with the flames of the fire\r\nthat destroys a town.\r\n\r\nThe solar spots vary in a fairly regular period of eleven to twelve\r\nyears. In certain years, _e.g._, 1893, they are vast, numerous and\r\nfrequent; in other years, _e.g._, 1901, they are few and insignificant.\r\nThe statistics are very carefully preserved. Here, for instance, is the\r\nsurface showing sun-spots expressed in millionths of the extent of the\r\nvisible solar surface:\r\n\r\n          1889            78\r\n          1890            99\r\n          1891           569\r\n          1892         1,214\r\n          1893         1,464\r\n          1895           974\r\n          1896           543\r\n          1897           514\r\n          1898           375\r\n          1899           111\r\n          1900            75\r\n          1901            29\r\n          1902            62\r\n\r\nThe years 1889 and 1901 were _minima_; the year 1893 a _maximum_.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that terrestrial magnetism and the boreal auroras\r\nexhibit an oscillation parallel to that of the solar spots, and\r\napparently the same occurs with regard to temperature.\r\n\r\nWe must regard our sun as a globe of gas in a state of combustion,\r\nburning at high temperature, and giving off a prodigious amount of heat\r\nand light. The dazzling surface of this globe is called a _photosphere_\r\n(light sphere). It is in perpetual motion, like the waves of an ocean of\r\nfire, whose roseate and transparent flames measure some 15,000\r\nkilometers (9,300 miles) in height. This stratum of rose-colored flames\r\nhas received the name of _chromosphere_ (color sphere). It is\r\ntransparent; it is not directly visible, but is seen only during the\r\ntotal eclipses of the Sun, when the dazzling disk of that luminary is\r\nentirely concealed by the Moon; or with the aid of the spectroscope. The\r\npart of the Sun that we see is its luminous surface, or photosphere.\r\n\r\nFrom this agitated surface there is a constant ejection of gigantic\r\neruptions, immense jets of flame, geysers of fire, projected at a\r\nterrific speed to prodigious heights.\r\n\r\nFor years astronomers were greatly perplexed as to the nature of these\r\nincandescent masses, known as prominences, which shot out like\r\nfireworks, and were only visible during the total eclipses of the Sun.\r\nBut now, thanks to an ingenious invention of Janssen and Lockyer, these\r\neruptions can be observed every day in the spectroscope, and have been\r\nregistered since 1868, more particularly in Rome and in Catania, where\r\nthe Society of Spectroscopists was founded with this especial object,\r\nand publishes monthly bulletins in statistics of the health of the Sun.\r\n\r\nThese prominences assume all imaginable forms, and often resemble our\r\nown storm-clouds; they rise above the chromosphere with incredible\r\nvelocity, often exceeding 200 kilometers (124 miles) per second, and\r\nare carried up to the amazing height of 300,000 kilometers (186,000\r\nmiles).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Rose-colored solar flames 228,000 kilometers\r\n(141,500 miles) in height, _i.e._, 18 times the diameter of the Earth.]\r\n\r\nThe Sun is surrounded with these enormous flames on every side;\r\nsometimes they shoot out into space like splendid curving roseate\r\nplumes; at others they rear their luminous heads in the Heavens, like\r\nthe cleft and waving leaves of giant palm-trees. Having illustrated a\r\nremarkable type of solar spot, it is interesting to submit to the reader\r\na precise observation of these curious solar flames. That reproduced\r\nhere was observed in Rome, January 30, 1885. It measured 228,000\r\nkilometers (141,500 miles) in height, eighteen times the diameter of the\r\nearth (represented alongside in its relative magnitude). (Fig. 31.)\r\n\r\nSolar eruptions have been seen to reach, in a few minutes, a height of\r\nmore than 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles), and then to fall back in a\r\nflaming torrent into that burning and inextinguishable ocean.\r\n\r\nObservation, in conjunction with spectral analysis, shows these\r\nprominences to be due to formidable explosions produced within the\r\nactual substance of the Sun, and projecting masses of incandescent\r\nhydrogen into space with considerable force.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. During an eclipse one sees around the black disk of the\r\nMoon as it passes in front of the Sun and intercepts its light, a\r\nbrilliant and rosy aureole with long, luminous, branching feathers\r\nstreaming out, like aigrettes, which extend a very considerable distance\r\nfrom the solar surface. This aureole, the nature of which is still\r\nunknown to us, has received the name of _corona_. It is a sort of\r\nimmense atmosphere, extremely rarefied. Our superb torch, accordingly,\r\nis a brazier of unparalleled activity--a globe of gas, agitated by\r\nphenomenal tempests whose flaming streamers extend afar. The smallest of\r\nthese flames is so potent that it would swallow up our world at a single\r\nbreath, like the bombs shot out by Vesuvius, that fall back within the\r\ncrater.\r\n\r\nWhat now is the real heat of this incandescent focus? The most accurate\r\nresearches estimate the temperature of the surface of the Sun at\r\n7,000°C. The internal temperature must be considerably higher. A\r\ncrucible of molten iron poured out upon the Sun would be as a stream of\r\nice and snow.\r\n\r\nWe can form some idea of this calorific force by making certain\r\ncomparisons. Thus, the heat given out appears to be equal to that which\r\nwould be emitted by a colossal globe of the same dimensions (that is, as\r\nvoluminous as twelve hundred and eighty thousand terrestrial globes),\r\nentirely covered with a layer of incandescent coal 28 kilometers (18\r\nmiles) in depth, all burning at equal combustion. The heat emitted by\r\nthe Sun, at each second, is equal to that which would result from the\r\ncombustion of eleven quadrillions six hundred thousand milliards of tons\r\nof coal, all burning together. This same heat would bring to the boil in\r\nan hour, two trillions nine hundred milliards of cubic kilometers of\r\nwater at freezing-point.\r\n\r\nOur little planet, gravitating at 149,000,000 kilometers (93,000,000\r\nmiles) from the Sun, arrests on the way, and utilizes, only the half of\r\na milliard part of this total radiation.\r\n\r\nHow is this heat maintained? One of the principal causes of the heat of\r\nthe Sun is its condensation. According to all probabilities, the solar\r\nglobe represents for us the nucleus of a vast nebula, that extended in\r\nprimitive times beyond the orbit of Neptune, and which in its\r\ncontraction has finally produced this central focus. In virtue of the\r\nlaw of transformation of motion into heat, this condensation, which has\r\nnot yet reached its limit, suffices to raise this colossal globe to its\r\nlevel of temperature, and to maintain it there for millions of years. In\r\naddition, a substantial number of meteors is forever falling into it.\r\nThis furnace is a true pandemonium.\r\n\r\nThe Sun weighs three hundred and twenty-four thousand times more than\r\nthe Earth--that is to say, eighteen hundred and seventy octillions of\r\nkilograms:\r\n\r\n           1,870,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000\r\n          (1,842,364,532,019,704,433,497,536,945 tons).\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XI we shall explain the methods by which it has been found\r\npossible to weigh the Sun and determine its exact distance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI trust these figures will convey some notion of the importance and\r\nnature of the Sun, the stupendous orb on whose rays our very existence\r\ndepends. Its apparent dimension (which is only half a degree, 32', and\r\nwould be hidden from sight, like that of the full moon, which is about\r\nthe same, by the tip of the little finger held out at arm's length),\r\nrepresents, as we have seen, a real dimension that is colossal, _i.e._,\r\n1,383,000 kilometers (more than 857,000 miles), and this is owing to the\r\nenormous distance that separates us from it. This distance of\r\n149,000,000 kilometers (93,000,000 miles) is sufficiently hard to\r\nappreciate. Let us say that 11,640 terrestrial globes would be required\r\nto throw a bridge from here to the Sun, while 30 would suffice from the\r\nEarth to the Moon. The Moon is 388 times nearer to us than the Sun. We\r\nmay perhaps conceive of this distance by calculating that a train,\r\nmoving at constant speed of 1 kilometer (0.6214 mile) a minute, would\r\ntake 149,000,000 minutes, that is to say 103,472 days, or 283 years, to\r\ncross the distance that separates us from this orb. Given the normal\r\nduration of life, neither the travelers who set out for the Sun, nor\r\ntheir children, nor their grandchildren, would arrive there: only the\r\nseventh generation would reach the goal, and only the fourteenth could\r\nbring us back news of it.\r\n\r\nChildren often cry for the Moon. If one of these inquisitive little\r\nbeings could stretch out its arms to touch the Sun, and burn its fingers\r\nthere, it would not feel the burn for one hundred and sixty-seven years\r\n(when it would no longer be an infant), for the nervous impulse of\r\nsensation can only be transmitted from the ends of the fingers to the\r\nbrain at a velocity of 28 meters per second.\r\n\r\n'Tis long. A cannon-ball would reach the Sun in ten years. Light, that\r\nrapid arrow that flies through space at a velocity of 300,000 kilometers\r\n(186,000 miles per second), takes only eight minutes seventeen seconds\r\nto traverse this distance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis brilliant Sun is not only sovereign of the Earth; he is also the\r\nhead of a vast planetary system.\r\n\r\nThe orbs that circle round the Sun are opaque bodies, spherical in\r\nshape, receiving their light and heat from the central star, on which\r\nthey absolutely depend. The name of planets given to them signifies\r\n\"wandering\" stars. If you observe the Heavens on a fine starry night,\r\nand are sufficiently acquainted with the principal stars of the Zodiac\r\nas described in a preceding chapter, you may be surprised on certain\r\nevenings to see the figure of some zodiacal constellation slightly\r\nmodified by the temporary presence of a brilliant orb perhaps surpassing\r\nin its luminosity the finest stars of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nIf you watch this apparition for some weeks, and examine its position\r\ncarefully in regard to the adjacent stars, you will observe that it\r\nchanges its position more or less slowly in the Heavens. These wandering\r\norbs, or _planets_, do not shine with intrinsic light; they are\r\nilluminated by the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe planets, in effect, are bodies as opaque as the Earth, traveling\r\nround the God of Day at a speed proportional to their distance. They\r\nnumber eight principal orbs, and may be divided into two quite distinct\r\ngroups by which we may recognize them: the first comprises four planets,\r\nof relatively small dimensions in comparison with those of the second\r\ngroup, which are so voluminous that the least important of them is\r\nlarger than the other four put together.\r\n\r\nIn order of distance from the Sun, we first encounter:\r\n\r\n          MERCURY, VENUS, THE EARTH, AND MARS\r\n\r\nThese are the worlds that are nearest to the orb of day.\r\n\r\nThe four following, and much more remote, are, still in order of\r\ndistance:\r\n\r\n          JUPITER, SATURN, URANUS, AND NEPTUNE\r\n\r\nThis second group is separated from the first by a vast space occupied\r\nby quite a little army of minute planets, tiny cosmic bodies, the\r\nlargest of which measures little more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) in\r\ndiameter, and the smallest some few miles only.\r\n\r\nThe planets which form these three groups represent the principal\r\nmembers of the solar family. But the Sun is a patriarch, and each of his\r\ndaughters has her own children who, while obeying the paternal influence\r\nof the fiery orb, are also obedient to the world that governs them.\r\nThese secondary asters, or _satellites_, follow the planets in their\r\ncourse, and revolve round them in an ellipse, just as the others rotate\r\nround the Sun. Every one knows the satellite of the Earth, the Moon. All\r\nthe other planets of our system have their own moons, some being even\r\nmore favored than ourselves in this respect, and having several. Mars\r\nhas two; Jupiter, five; Saturn, eight; Uranus, four; and Neptune, one\r\n(at least as yet discovered).\r\n\r\nIn order to realize the relations between these worlds, we must\r\nappreciate their distances by arranging them in a little table:\r\n\r\n                         Distance in    Distance in\r\n                         Millions of    Millions of\r\n                         Kilometers.       Miles.\r\n          Mercury             57              35\r\n          Venus              108              67\r\n          The Earth          149              93\r\n          Mars               226             140\r\n          Jupiter            775             481\r\n          Saturn           1,421             882\r\n          Uranus           2,831           1,755\r\n          Neptune          4,470           2,771\r\n\r\nThe Sun is at the center (or, more properly speaking, at the focus, for\r\nthe planets describe an ellipse) of this system, and controls them.\r\nNeptune is thirty times farther from the Sun than the Earth. These\r\ndisparities of distance produce a vast difference in the periods of the\r\nplanetary revolutions; for while the Earth revolves round the Sun in a\r\nyear, Venus in 224 days, and Mercury in 88, Mars takes nearly 2 years to\r\naccomplish his journey, Jupiter 12 years, Saturn 29, Uranus 84, and\r\nNeptune 165.\r\n\r\nEven the planets and their moons do not represent the Sun's complete\r\npaternity. There are further, in the solar republic, certain vagabond\r\nand irregular orbs that travel at a speed that is often most immoderate,\r\noccasionally approaching the Sun, not to be consumed therein, but, as it\r\nappears, to draw from its radiant source the provision of forces\r\nnecessary for their perigrinations through space. These are the\r\n_Comets_, which pursue an extremely elongated orbit round the Sun, to\r\nwhich at times they approximate very closely, at other times being\r\nexcessively distant.\r\n\r\nAnd now to recapitulate our knowledge of the Solar Empire. In the first\r\nplace, we see a colossal globe of fire dominating and governing the\r\nworlds that belong to him. Around him are grouped planets, in number\r\neight principal, formed of solid and obscure matter, gravitating round\r\nthe central orb. Other secondary orbs, the satellites, revolve round the\r\nplanets, which keep them within the sphere of their attraction. And\r\nlastly, the comets, irregular celestial bodies, track the whole extent\r\nof the great solar province. To these might be added the whirlwinds of\r\nmeteors, as it were disaggregated comets, which also circle round the\r\nSun, and give origin to shooting stars, when they come into collision\r\nwith the Earth.\r\n\r\nHaving now a general idea of our celestial family, and an appreciation\r\nof the potent focus that controls it, let us make direct acquaintance\r\nwith the several members of which it is composed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE PLANETS\r\n\r\n_A._--MERCURY, VENUS, THE EARTH, MARS\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now we are in the Solar System, at the center, or, better, at the\r\nfocus of which burns the immense and dazzling orb. We have appreciated\r\nthe grandeur and potency of the solar globe, whose rays spread out in\r\nactive waves that bear a fecundating illumination to the worlds that\r\ngravitate round him; we have appreciated the distance that separates the\r\nSun from the Earth, the third of the planets retained within his domain,\r\nor at least I trust that the comparisons of the times required by\r\ncertain moving objects to traverse this distance have enabled us to\r\nconceive it.\r\n\r\nWe said that the four planets nearest to the Sun are Mercury, at a\r\ndistance of 57 million kilometers (35,000,000 miles); Venus, at 108\r\nmillion (67,000,000 miles); the Earth, at 149 million (93,000,000\r\nmiles); and Mars at 226 million (140,000,000 miles). Let us begin our\r\nplanetary journey with these four stations.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY\r\n\r\nA little above the Sun one sometimes sees, now in the West, in the\r\nlingering shimmer of the twilight, now in the East, when the tender\r\nroseate dawn announces the advent of a clear day, a small star of the\r\nfirst magnitude which remains but a very short time above the horizon,\r\nand then plunges back into the flaming sun. This is Mercury, the agile\r\nand active messenger of Olympus, the god of eloquence, of medicine, of\r\ncommerce, and of thieves. One only sees him furtively, from time to\r\ntime, at the periods of his greatest elongations, either after the\r\nsetting or before the rising of the radiant orb, when he presents the\r\naspect of a somewhat reddish star.\r\n\r\nThis planet, like the others, shines only by the reflection of the Sun\r\nwhose illumination he receives, and as he is in close juxtaposition with\r\nit, his light is bright enough, though his volume is inconsiderable. He\r\nis smaller than the Earth. His revolution round the Sun being\r\naccomplished in about three months, he passes rapidly, in a month and a\r\nhalf, from one side to the other of the orb of day, and is alternately a\r\nmorning and an evening star. The ancients originally regarded it as two\r\nseparate planets; but with attentive observation, they soon perceived\r\nits identity. In our somewhat foggy climates, it can only be discovered\r\nonce or twice a year, and then only by looking for it according to the\r\nindications given in the astronomic almanacs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Orbits of the four Planets nearest to the Sun.]\r\n\r\nMercury courses round the Sun at a distance of 57,000,000 kilometers\r\n(35,000,000 miles), and accomplishes his revolution in 87 days, 23\r\nhours, 15 minutes; _i.e._, 2 months, 27 days, 23 hours, or a little less\r\nthan three of our months. If the conditions of life are the same there\r\nas here, the existence of the Mercurians must be four times as short as\r\nour own. A youth of twenty, awaking to the promise of the life he is\r\njust beginning in this world, is an octogenarian in Mercury. There the\r\nfair sex would indeed be justified in bewailing the transitory nature of\r\nlife, and might regret the years that pass too quickly away. Perhaps,\r\nhowever, they are more philosophic than with us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Orbits of the four Planets farthest from the\r\nSun.]\r\n\r\nThe orbit of Mercury, which of course is within that of the Earth, is\r\nnot circular, but elliptical, and very eccentric, so elongated that at\r\ncertain times of the year this planet is extremely remote from the solar\r\nfocus, and receives only half as much heat and light as at the opposite\r\nperiod; and, in consequence, his distance from the Earth varies\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Mercury near quadrature.]\r\n\r\nThis globe exhibits _phases_, discovered in the seventeenth century by\r\nGalileo, which recall those of the Moon. They are due to the motions of\r\nthe planet round the Sun, and are invisible to the unaided eye, but with\r\neven a small instrument, one can follow the gradations and study Mercury\r\nunder every aspect. Sometimes, again, he passes exactly in front of the\r\nSun, and his disk is projected like a black point upon the luminous\r\nsurface of the flaming orb. This occurred, notably, on May 10, 1891, and\r\nNovember 10, 1894; and the phenomenon will recur on November 12, 1907,\r\nand November 6, 1914.\r\n\r\nMercury is the least of all the worlds in our system (with the exception\r\nof the cosmic fragments that circulate between the orbit of Mars and\r\nthat of Jupiter). His volume equals only 5/100 that of the Earth. His\r\ndiameter, in comparison with that of our planet, is in the ratio of 373\r\nto 1,000 (a little more than 1/3) and measures 4,750 kilometers (2,946\r\nmiles). His density is the highest of all the worlds in the great solar\r\nfamily, and exceeds that of our Earth by about 1/3; but weight there is\r\nless by almost 1/2.\r\n\r\nMercury is enveloped in a very dense, thick atmosphere, which doubtless\r\nsensibly tempers the solar heat, for the Sun exhibits to the Mercurians\r\na luminous disk about seven times more extensive than that with which we\r\nare familiar on the Earth, and when Mercury is at perihelion (that is,\r\nnearest to the Sun), his inhabitants receive ten times more light and\r\nheat than we obtain at midsummer. In all probability, it would be\r\nimpossible for us to set foot on this planet without being shattered by\r\na sunstroke.\r\n\r\nYet we may well imagine that Nature's fecundity can have engendered\r\nbeings there of an organization different from our own, adapted to an\r\nexistence in the proximity of fire. What magnificent landscapes may\r\nthere be adorned with the luxuriant vegetation that develops rapidly\r\nunder an ardent and generous sun?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--The Earth viewed from Mercury.]\r\n\r\nObservations of Mercury are taken under great difficulties, just because\r\nof the immediate proximity of the solar furnace; yet some have detected\r\npatches that might be seas. In any case, these observations are\r\ncontradictory and uncertain.\r\n\r\nUp to the present it has been impossible to determine the duration of\r\nthe rotation. Some astronomers even think that the Sun's close proximity\r\nmust have produced strong tides, that would, as it were, have\r\nimmobilized the globe of Mercury, just as the Earth has immobilized the\r\nMoon, forcing it perpetually to present the same side to the Sun. From\r\nthe point of view of habitation, this situation would be somewhat\r\npeculiar; perpetual day upon the illumined half, perpetual night upon\r\nthe other hemisphere, and a fairly large zone of twilight between the\r\ntwo. Such a condition would indeed be different from the succession of\r\nterrestrial days and nights.\r\n\r\nAs seen from Mercury, the Earth we inhabit would shine out in the starry\r\nsky[9] as a magnificent orb of first magnitude, with the Moon\r\nalongside, a faithful little companion. They should form a fine double\r\nstar, the Earth being a brilliant orb of first magnitude, and the Moon\r\nof third, a charming couple, and admired doubtless as an enchanted and\r\nprivileged abode.\r\n\r\nIt is at midnight during the oppositions of the Earth with the Sun that\r\nour planet is the most beautiful and brilliant, as is Jupiter for\r\nourselves. The constellations are the same, viewed from Mercury or from\r\nthe Earth.\r\n\r\nBut is this little solar planet inhabited? We do not yet know. We can\r\nonly reply: why not?\r\n\r\n\r\nVENUS\r\n\r\nWhen the sunset atmosphere is crimson with the glorious rays of the King\r\nof Orbs, and all Nature assumes the brooding veil of twilight, the most\r\nindifferent eyes are often attracted and captivated by the presence of a\r\nstar that is almost dazzling, and illuminates with its white and limpid\r\nlight the heavens darkened by the disappearance of the God of Day.\r\n\r\nHail, Venus, Queen of the Heavens! the \"Shepherd's Star,\" gentle mother\r\nof the loves, goddess of beauty, eternally adored and cherished, sung\r\nand immortalized upon Earth, by poets and artists. Her splendid\r\nbrilliancy attracted notice from earliest antiquity, and we find her,\r\nradiant and charming, in the works of the ancients, who erected altars\r\nto her and adorned their poetry with her grace and beauty. Homer calls\r\nher Callisto the Beautiful; Cicero names her Vesper, the evening star,\r\nand Lucifer, the star of the morning--for it was with this divinity as\r\nwith Mercury. For a long while she was regarded as two separate planets,\r\nand it was only when it came to be observed that the evening and the\r\nmorning star were always in periodic succession, that the identity of\r\nthe orb was recognized.\r\n\r\nHer radiant splendor created her mythological personality, just as the\r\nagility of Mercury created that of the messenger of the gods.\r\n\r\nWe do not see her aerial chariot in the Heavens drawn by a flight of\r\ndoves with white and fluttering wings, but we follow the lustrous orb\r\nled on through space by solar attraction. And in the beautiful evenings\r\nwhen she is at her greatest distance from our Sun, the whole world\r\nadmires this white and dazzling Venus reigning as sovereign over our\r\ntwilight[10] for hours after sunset, and in addition to the _savants_\r\nwho are practically occupied with astronomy, millions of eyes are raised\r\nto this celestial splendor, and for a moment millions of human beings\r\nfeel some curiosity about the mysteries of the Infinite. The brutalities\r\nof daily life would fain petrify our dreams, but thought is not yet\r\nstifled to the point of checking all aspirations after eternal truth,\r\nand when we gaze at the starry sky it is hard not to ask ourselves the\r\nnature of those other worlds, and the place occupied by our own planet\r\nin the vast concert of sidereal harmony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--The Evening Star.]\r\n\r\nEven through a small telescope, Venus offers remarkable phases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Successive phases of Venus.]\r\n\r\nFig. 37 gives some notion of the succession of these, and of the\r\nplanet's variations in magnitude during its journey round the Sun.\r\nImagine it to be rotating in a year of 224 days, 16 hours, 49 minutes, 8\r\nseconds at a distance of 108 million kilometers (67,000,000 miles), the\r\nEarth being at 149 million kilometers (93,000,000 miles). Like Mercury,\r\nat certain periods it passes between the Sun and ourselves, and as its\r\nilluminated hemisphere is of course turned toward the orb of day, we at\r\nthose times perceive only a sharp and very luminous crescent. At such\r\nperiods Venus is entirely, so to say, against the Sun, and presents to\r\nus her greatest apparent dimension (Fig. 38). Sometimes, again, like\r\nMercury, she passes immediately in front of the Sun, forming a perfectly\r\nround black spot; this happened on December 8, 1874, and December 6,\r\n1882; and will recur on June 7, 2004, and June 5, 2012. These transits\r\nhave been utilized in celestial geometry in measuring the distance of\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\nYou will readily divine that the distance of Venus varies considerably\r\naccording to her position in relation to the Earth: when she is between\r\nthe Sun and ourselves she is nearest to our world; but it is just at\r\nthose times that we see least of her surface, because she exhibits to us\r\nonly a slender crescent. Terrestrial astronomers are accordingly very\r\nbadly placed for the study of her physical constitution. The best\r\nobservations can be made when she is situated to right or left of the\r\nSun, and shows us about half her illuminated disk--during the day for\r\nchoice, because at night there is too much irradiation from her dazzling\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThese phases were discovered by Galileo, in 1610. His observations were\r\namong the first that confirmed the veracity of the system of Copernicus,\r\naffording an evident example of the movement of the planets round the\r\nsun. They are often visible to the unaided eye with good sight, either\r\nat dusk, or through light clouds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Venus at greatest brilliancy.]\r\n\r\nVenus, surrounded by a highly dense and rarefied atmosphere, which\r\nincreases the difficulties of observing her surface, might be called the\r\ntwin sister of the Earth, so similar are the dimensions of the two\r\nworlds. But, strange as it may seem to the many admirers, who are ready\r\nto hail in her an abode of joy and happiness, it is most probable that\r\nthis planet, attractive as she is at a distance, would be a less\r\ndesirable habitation than our floating island. In fact, the atmosphere\r\nof Venus is perpetually covered with cloud, so that the weather there\r\nmust be always foggy. No definite geographical configuration can be\r\ndiscovered on her, despite the hopes of the eighteenth-century\r\nastronomers. We are not even sure that she rotates upon herself, so\r\ncontradictory are the observations, and so hard is it to distinguish\r\nanything clearly upon her surface. A single night of observation\r\nsuffices to show the rotation of Mars or of Jupiter; but the beautiful\r\nEvening Star remains obstinately veiled from our curiosity.\r\n\r\nSeveral astronomers, and not the least considerable, think that the\r\ntides produced by the Sun upon her seas, or globe in its state of\r\npristine fluidity, must have been strong enough to seize and fix her, as\r\nthe Earth did for the Moon, thus obliging her to present always the same\r\nface to the Sun. Certain telescopic observations would even seem to\r\nconfirm this theoretical deduction from the calculations of celestial\r\nmechanics.\r\n\r\nThe author ventures to disagree with this opinion, its apparent\r\nprobability notwithstanding, because he has invariably received a\r\ncontrary impression from all his telescopic observations. He has quite\r\nrecently (spring of 1903) repeated these observations. Choosing a\r\nremarkably clear and perfectly calm atmosphere, he examined the splendid\r\nplanet several times with great attention in the field of the telescope.\r\nThe right or eastern border (reversed image) was dulled by the\r\natmosphere of Venus; this is the line of separation between day and\r\nnight. Beneath, at the extreme northern edge, he was attracted on each\r\noccasion by a small white patch, a little whiter than the rest of the\r\nsurface of the planet, surrounded by a light-gray penumbra, giving the\r\nexact effect of a polar snow, very analogous to that observed at the\r\npoles of Mars. To the author this white spot on the boreal horn of\r\nVenus does not appear to be due to an effect of contrast, as has\r\nsometimes been supposed.\r\n\r\nNow, if the globe of Venus has poles, it must turn upon itself.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it has proved impossible to distinguish any sign upon the\r\ndisk, indicative of the direction and speed of its rotary movement,\r\nalthough these observations were made, with others, under excellent\r\nconditions.--Three o'clock in the afternoon, brilliant sun, sky clear\r\nblue, the planet but little removed from the meridian--at which time it\r\nis less dazzling than in the evening.\r\n\r\nThere is merely the impression; but it is so definite as to prevent the\r\nauthor from adopting the new hypothesis, in virtue of which the planet,\r\nas it gravitates round the Sun, presents always the same hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIf this hypothesis were a reality, Venus would certainly be a very\r\npeculiar world. Eternal day on the one side; eternal night on the other.\r\nMaximum light and heat at the center of the hemisphere perpetually\r\nturned to the Sun; maximum cold and center of night at the antipodes.\r\nThis icy hemisphere would possibly be uninhabitable, but the resources\r\nof Nature are so prodigious, and the law of Life is so imperious, so\r\npersistent, under the most disadvantageous and deplorable terrestrial\r\nconditions, that it would be transcending our rights to declare an\r\nimpossibility of existence, even in this eternal night. The currents of\r\nthe atmosphere would no doubt suffice to set up perpetual changes of\r\ntemperature between the two hemispheres, in comparison with which our\r\ntrade-winds would be the lightest of breezes.\r\n\r\nYes, mystery still reigns upon this adjacent earth, and the most\r\npowerful instruments of the observatories of the whole world have been\r\nunable to solve it. All we know is that the diameter, surface, volume\r\nand mass of this planet, and its weight at the surface, do not differ\r\nsensibly from those that characterize our own globe: that this planet is\r\nsister to our own, and of the same order, hence probably formed of the\r\nsame elements. We further know that, as seen from Venus (Fig. 39), the\r\nEarth on which we live is a magnificent star, a double orb more\r\nbrilliant even than when viewed from Mercury. It is a dazzling orb of\r\nfirst magnitude, accompanied by its moon, a star of the second and a\r\nhalf magnitude.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the worlds float on in space, distant symbols of hopes not\r\nrealized on any one of them, all at different stages of their degree of\r\nevolution, representing an ever-growing progress in the sequence of the\r\nages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--The Earth viewed from Venus.]\r\n\r\nWhen we contemplate this radiant Venus, it is difficult, even if we can\r\nnot form any definite idea as to her actual state as regards habitation,\r\nto assume that she must be a dreary desert, and not, on the contrary,\r\nto hail in her a celestial land, differing more or less from our own\r\ndwelling-place, travailing with her sisters in the accomplishment of the\r\ngeneral plan of Nature.\r\n\r\nSuch are the characteristic features of our celestial neighbor. In\r\nquitting her, we reach the Earth, which comes immediately next her in\r\norder of distance, 149 million kilometers (93,000,000 miles) from the\r\nSun, but as we shall devote an entire chapter to our own planet, we will\r\nnot halt at this point, but cross in one step the distance that\r\nseparates Mars from Venus.\r\n\r\nLet us only remark in passing, that our planet is the largest of the\r\nfour spheres adjacent to the Sun. Here are their comparative diameters:\r\n\r\n                         The Earth = 1.    In Kilometers.    In Miles.\r\n          Mercury             0.373             4,750           2,946\r\n          Venus               0.999            12,730           7,894\r\n          Earth               1.000            12,742           7,926\r\n          Mars                0.528             6,728           4,172\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Venus is almost identical with the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARS\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and twenty-six millions of kilometers (140,000,000 miles)\r\nfrom the Sun is the planet Mars, gravitating in an orbit exterior to\r\nthat which the Earth takes annually round the same center.\r\n\r\nUnfortunate Mars! What evil fairy presided at his birth? From\r\nantiquity, all curses seem to have fallen upon him. He is the god of war\r\nand of carnage, the protector of armies, the inspirer of hatred among\r\nthe peoples, it is he who pours out the blood of Humanity in\r\ninternational hecatombs. Here, again, as in the case of Mercury and\r\nVenus, the appearance has originated the idea. Mars, in fact, burns like\r\na drop of blood in the depths of the firmament, and it is this ruddy\r\ncolor that inspired its name and attributes, just as the dazzling\r\nwhiteness of Venus made her the goddess of love and beauty. Why, indeed,\r\nshould the origins of mythology be sought elsewhere than in astronomy?\r\n\r\nWhile Humanity was attributing to the presumptive influence of Mars the\r\ndefects inherent in its own terrestrial nature, this world, unwitting of\r\nour sorrows, pursued the celestial path marked out for it in space by\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nThis planet is, as we have said, the first encountered after the Earth.\r\nIts orbit is very elongated, very eccentric. Mars accomplishes it in a\r\nperiod of 1 year, 321 days, 22 hours, _i.e._, 1 year, 10 months, 21\r\ndays, or 687 days. The velocity of its transit is 23 kilometers (14.5\r\nmiles) per second; that of the Earth is 30 (19 miles). Our planet,\r\ntraveling through space at an average distance of 149 million kilometers\r\n(93,000,000 miles) from the central focus, is separated from Mars by an\r\naverage distance of 76 million kilometers (47,000,000 miles); but as its\r\norbit is equally elliptic and elongated it follows that at certain\r\nepochs the two planets approach one another by something less than 60\r\nmillion kilometers (37,000,000 miles). These are the periods selected\r\nfor making the best observations upon our neighbor of the ruddy rays.\r\nThe oppositions of Mars arrive about every twenty-six months, but the\r\nperiods of its greatest proximity, when this planet approaches to within\r\n56 million kilometers (34,700,000 miles) of the Earth, occur only every\r\nfifteen years.\r\n\r\nMars is then passing perihelion, while our world is at aphelion (or\r\ngreatest distance from the Sun). At such epochs this globe presents to\r\nus an apparent diameter 63 times smaller than that of the Moon, _i.e._,\r\na telescope that magnifies 63 times would show him to us of the same\r\nmagnitude as our satellite viewed with the unaided eye, and an\r\ninstrument that magnified 630 times would show him ten times larger in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nIn dimensions he differs considerably from our world, being almost half\r\nthe size of the Earth. In diameter he measures only 6,728 kilometers\r\n(4,172 miles), and his circumference is 21,125 kilometers (13,000\r\nmiles). His surface is only 29/100 of the terrestrial surface, and his\r\nvolume only 15/100 of our own.\r\n\r\nThis difference in volume causes Mars to be an earth in miniature. When\r\nwe study his aspects, his geography, his meteorology, we seem to see in\r\nspace a reduction of our own abode, with certain dissimilarities that\r\nexcite our curiosity, and make him even more interesting to us.\r\n\r\nThe Martian world weighs nine times and a half less than our own. If we\r\nrepresent the weight of the Earth by 1,000, that of Mars would be\r\nrepresented by 105. His density is much less than our own; it is only\r\n7/10 that of the Earth. A man weighing 70 kilograms, transported to the\r\nadjacent globe, would weigh only 26 kilograms.\r\n\r\nThe earliest telescopic observations revealed the existence of more or\r\nless accentuated markings upon the surface of Mars. The progress of\r\noptics, admitting of greater magnifications, exhibited the form of these\r\npatches more clearly, while the study of their motions enabled the\r\nastronomers to determine with remarkable precision the diurnal rotation\r\nof this planet. It occurs in 24 hours, 37 minutes, 23.65 seconds. Day\r\nand night are accordingly a little longer on Mars than on the Earth, but\r\nthe difference is obviously inconsiderable. The year of Mars consists of\r\n668 Martian days. The inclination of the axis of rotation of this globe\r\nupon the plane of its orbit is much the same as our own. In\r\nconsequence, its seasons are analogous to ours in intensity, while twice\r\nthe length, the Martian year being almost equal to two of our years. The\r\nintensity of the seasons is indeed more accentuated than upon the Earth,\r\nsince the orbit of Mars is very elongated. But there, as here, are three\r\nquite distinct zones: the torrid, the temperate, and the glacial.\r\n\r\nBy means of the telescope we can follow the variations of the Martian\r\nseasons, especially in what concerns the polar snows, which regularly\r\naggregate during the winter, and melt no less regularly during the heat\r\nof the summer. These snows are very easily observed, and stand out\r\nclearly with dazzling whiteness. The reader can judge of them by the\r\naccompanying figure, which sums up the author's observations during one\r\nof the recent oppositions of Mars (1900-1901). The size of the polar cap\r\ndiminished from 4,680 kilometers to 840. The solstice of the Martian\r\nsummer was on April 11th. The snows were still melting on July 6th.\r\nSometimes they disappear almost entirely during the Martian month that\r\ncorresponds to our month of August, as never happens with our polar ice.\r\nHence, though this planet is farther away from the Sun than ourselves,\r\nit does not appear to be colder, or, at any rate, it is certain that the\r\npolar snows are much less thick.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are hardly ever clouds on Mars; the Martian\r\natmosphere is almost always limpid, and one can say that fine weather is\r\nthe chronic state of the planet. At times, light fogs or a little vapor\r\nwill appear in certain regions, but they are soon dissipated, and the\r\nsky clears up again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Diminution of the polar snows of Mars during\r\nthe summer.]\r\n\r\nSince the invention of the telescope, a considerable number of drawings\r\nhave been made, depicting Mars under every aspect, and the agreement\r\nbetween these numerous observations gives us a sufficient acquaintance\r\nwith the planet to admit of our indicating the characteristic features\r\nof its geography, and of drawing out _areographic_ maps (_Ares_, Mars).\r\nIts appearance can be judged of from the two drawings here reproduced,\r\nas made (February, 1901) at the Observatory of Juvisy, and from the\r\ngeneral chart drawn from the total sum of observations (Figs. 41, 42 and\r\n43).\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at the first glance that the geography of Mars is very\r\ndifferent from that of our own globe: while three-quarters of the Earth\r\nare covered with the liquid element, Mars seems to be more evenly\r\ndivided, and must indeed have rather more land than water. We find no\r\nimmense oceans surrounding the continents, and separating them like\r\nislands; on the contrary, the seas are reduced to long gulfs compressed\r\nbetween the shores, like the Mediterranean for example, nor is it even\r\ncertain that these gray spots do all represent true seas. It has been\r\nagreed to term _sea_ the parts that are lightly tinged with green, and\r\nto give the name of _continent_ to the spots colored yellow. That is the\r\nhue of the Martian soil, due either to the soil itself, which would\r\nresemble that of the Sahara, or, to take a less arid region, that seen\r\non the line between Marseilles and Nice, in the vicinity of the\r\nEsterels; or perhaps to some peculiar vegetation. During ascents in a\r\nballoon, the author has often remarked that the hue of the ripe corn,\r\nwith the Sun shining on it, is precisely that presented to us by the\r\ncontinents of Mars in the best hours for observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Telescopic aspect of the planet Mars (Feb.,\r\n1901).]\r\n\r\nAs to the \"seas,\" it is pretty certain that there must be water, or\r\nsome kind of liquid, deriving above all from the melting of the polar\r\nsnows in spring and summer; but it may possibly be in conjunction with\r\nsome vegetation, aquatic plants, or perhaps vast meadows, which appear\r\nto us from here to be the more considerable in proportion as the water\r\nthat nourishes them has been more abundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Telescopic aspect of the planet Mars (Feb.,\r\n1901).]\r\n\r\nMars, like our globe, is surrounded with a protective atmosphere, which\r\nretains the rays of the Sun, and must preserve a medium temperature\r\nfavorable to the conservation of life upon the surface of the planet.\r\nBut the circulation of the water, so important to terrestrial life,\r\nwhether animal or vegetable, which is effected upon our planet by the\r\nevaporation of the seas, clouds, winds, rains, wells, rivers and\r\nstreams, comes about quite differently on Mars; for, as was remarked\r\nabove, it is rarely that any clouds are observed there. Instead of being\r\nvertical, as here, this circulation is horizontal: the water coming from\r\nthe source of the polar snows finds its way into the canals and seas,\r\nand returns to be condensed at the poles by a light drift of invisible\r\nvapors directed from the equator to the poles. There is never any rain.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of _canals_. One of the great puzzles of the Martian\r\nworld is incontestably the appearance of straight lines that furrow its\r\nsurface in all directions, and seem to connect the seas. M.\r\nSchiaparelli, the distinguished Director of the Observatory of Milan,\r\nwho discovered them in 1877, called them canals, without, however,\r\npostulating anything as to their real nature. Are they indeed canals?\r\nThese straight lines, measuring sometimes 600 kilometers (372 miles) in\r\nlength, and more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) in breadth, have much\r\nthe same hue as the seas on which they open. For a quarter of a century\r\nthey have been surveyed by the greater number of our observers. But it\r\nmust be confessed that, even with the best instruments, we only approach\r\nMars at a distance of 60,000 kilometers (37,200 miles), which is still a\r\nlittle far off, and we may be sure that we do not distinguish the true\r\ndetails of the surface.[11] These details at the limits of visibility\r\nproduce the appearance of canals to our eyes. They may possibly be lines\r\nof lakes, or oases. The future will no doubt clear up this mystery for\r\nus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Chart of Mars.]\r\n\r\nAs to the inhabitants of Mars, this world is in a situation as\r\nfavorable as our Earth for habitation, and it would be difficult to\r\ndiscover any reason for perpetual sterility there. It appears to us, on\r\nthe contrary, by its rapid and frequent variations of aspect, to be a\r\nvery living world. Its atmosphere, which is always clear, has not the\r\ndensity of our own, and resembles that of the highest mountains. The\r\nconditions of existence there vary from ours, and appear to be more\r\ndelicate, more ethereal.\r\n\r\nThere as here, day succeeds to night, spring softens the rigors of\r\nwinter; the seasons unfold, less disparate than our own, of which we\r\nhave such frequent reason to complain. The sky is perpetually clear.\r\nThere are never tempests, hurricanes, nor cyclones, the wind never gets\r\nup any force there, on account of the rarity of the atmosphere, and the\r\nlow intensity of weight.\r\n\r\nDiffering from ours, this world may well be a more congenial\r\nhabitation. It is more ancient than the Earth, smaller, less massive. It\r\nhas run more quickly through the phases of its evolution. Its astral\r\nlife is more advanced, and its Humanity should be superior to our own,\r\njust as our successors a million years hence, for example, will be less\r\ncoarse and barbarous than we are at present: the law of progress governs\r\nall the worlds, and, moreover, the physical constitution of the planet\r\nMars is less dense than our own.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to despair of entering some day into communication with\r\nthese unknown beings. The luminous points that have been observed are no\r\nsignals, but high summits or light clouds illuminated by the rising or\r\nsetting sun. But the idea of communication with them in the future is no\r\nmore audacious and no less scientific than the invention of spectral\r\nanalysis, X-rays, or wireless telegraphy.\r\n\r\nWe may suppose that the study of astronomy is further advanced in Mars\r\nthan on the Earth, because humanity itself has advanced further, and\r\nbecause the starry sky is far finer there, far easier to study, owing to\r\nthe limpidity of its pure, clear atmosphere.\r\n\r\nTwo small moons (hardly larger than the city of Paris) revolve rapidly\r\nround Mars; they are called Phobos and Deimos. The former, at a distance\r\nof 6,000 kilometers (3,730 miles) from the surface, accomplishes its\r\nrevolution rapidly, in seven hours, thirty-nine minutes, and thus makes\r\nthe entire circle of the Heavens three times a day. The second\r\ngravitates at 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles), and turns round its\r\ncenter of attraction in thirty hours and eighteen minutes. These two\r\nsatellites were discovered by Mr. Hall, at the University of Washington,\r\nin the month of August, 1877.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the finest and most interesting of the celestial phenomena admired\r\nby the Martians, at certain epochs of the year,--now at night when the\r\nSun has plunged into his fiery bed, now in the morning, a little before\r\nthe aurora,--is a magnificent star of first magnitude, never far removed\r\nfrom the orb of day, which presents to them the same aspects as does\r\nVenus to ourselves. This splendid orb, which has doubtless received the\r\nmost flattering names from those who contemplate it, this radiant star\r\nof a beautiful greenish blue, courses in space accompanied by a little\r\nsatellite, sparkling like some splendid diamond, after sunset, in the\r\nclear sky of Mars. This superb orb is the Earth, and the little star\r\naccompanying it is the Moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--The Earth viewed from Mars.]\r\n\r\nYes, to the Martians our Earth is a star of the morning and evening;\r\ndoubtless they have determined her phases. Many a vow, and many a hope\r\nmust have been wafted toward her, more than one broken heart must have\r\npermitted its unrealized dreams to wander forth to our planet as to an\r\nabode of happiness where all who have suffered in their native world\r\nmight find a haven. But our planet, alas! is not as perfect as they\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\nWe must not dally upon Mars, but hasten our celestial excursion toward\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE PLANETS\r\n\r\n_B._--JUPITER, SATURN, URANUS, NEPTUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we attack the giant world of our system, we must halt for a few\r\nmoments upon the minor planets which circulate between the orbit of Mars\r\nand that of Jupiter. These minute asters, little worlds, the largest of\r\nwhich measures scarcely more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) in diameter,\r\nare fragments of cosmic matter that once belonged to a vast ring, formed\r\nat the time when the solar system was only an immense nebula; and which,\r\ninstead of condensing into a single globe coursing between Mars and\r\nJupiter, split up into a considerable quantity of particles constituting\r\nat the present time the curious and highly interesting Republic of the\r\nAsteroids.\r\n\r\nThese lilliputian worlds at first received the names of the more\r\ncelebrated of the minor mythological divinities--Ceres, Pallas, Juno,\r\nVesta, etc., but as they rapidly increased in number, it was found\r\nnecessary to call them by modern, terrestrial names, and more than one\r\ndaughter of Eve, the Egeria of some astronomer, now has her name\r\ninscribed in the Heavens. The first minor planet was discovered on the\r\nfirst day of the nineteenth century, January 1, 1801, by Piazzi,\r\nastronomer at Palermo. While he was observing the small stars in the\r\nconstellation of the Bull beneath the clear Sicilian skies, this famous\r\nastronomer noticed one that he had never seen before.\r\n\r\nThe next night, directing his telescope to the same part of the Heavens,\r\nhe perceived that the fair unknown had moved her station, and the\r\nobservations of the following days left him no doubt as to the nature of\r\nthe visitor: she was a planet, a wandering star among the\r\nconstellations, revolving round the Sun. This newcomer was registered\r\nunder the name of Ceres.\r\n\r\nSince that epoch several hundreds of them have been discovered,\r\noccupying a zone that extends over a space of more than 400 million\r\nkilometers (249,000,000 miles). These celestial globules are invisible\r\nto the naked eye, but no year passes without new and numerous recruits\r\nbeing added to the already important catalogue of these minute asters by\r\nthe patient observers of the Heavens. To-day, they are most frequently\r\ndiscovered by the photographic method of following the displacement of\r\nthe tiny moving points upon an exposed sensitive plate.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUPITER\r\n\r\nAnd now let us bow respectfully before Jupiter, the giant of the worlds.\r\nThis glorious planet is indeed King of the Solar System.\r\n\r\nWhile Mercury measures only 4,750 kilometers (2,946 miles) in diameter,\r\nand Mars 6,728 kilometers (4,172), Jupiter is no less than 140,920\r\nkilometers (87,400 miles) in breadth; that is to say, eleven times\r\nlarger than the Earth. He is 442,500 kilometers (274,357 miles) in\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\nIn volume he is equivalent to 1,279 terrestrial globes; hence he is only\r\na million times smaller than the Sun. The previously described planets\r\nof our system, Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars combined, would form\r\nonly an insignificant mass in comparison with this colossus. A hundred\r\nand twenty-six Earths joined into one group would present a surface\r\nwhose extent would still not be quite as vast as the superficies of this\r\ntitanic world. This immense globe weighs 310 times more than that which\r\nwe inhabit. Its density is only the quarter of our own; but weight is\r\ntwice and a half times as great there as here. The constituents of\r\nthings and beings are thus composed of materials lighter than those upon\r\nthe Earth; but, as the planet exerts a force of attraction twice and a\r\nhalf times as powerful, they are in reality heavier and weigh more. A\r\ngraceful maiden weighing fifty kilograms would if transported to Jupiter\r\nimmediately be included in the imposing society of the \"Hundred Kilos.\"\r\n\r\nJupiter rotates upon himself with prodigious rapidity. He accomplishes\r\nhis diurnal revolution in less than ten hours! There the day lasts half\r\nas long as here, and while we reckoned fifteen days upon our calendar,\r\nthe Jovian would count thirty-six. As Jupiter's year equals nearly\r\ntwelve of ours, the almanac of that planet would contain 10,455 days!\r\nObviously, our pretty little pocket calendars would never serve to\r\nenumerate all the dates in this vast world.\r\n\r\nThis splendid globe courses in space at a distance of 775,000,000\r\nkilometers (480,500,000 miles) from the Sun. Hence it is five times\r\n(5.2) as remote from the orb of day as our Earth, and its orbit is five\r\ntimes vaster than our own. At that distance the Sun subtends a diameter\r\nfive times smaller than that which we see, and its surface is\r\ntwenty-seven times less extensive; accordingly this planetary abode\r\nreceives on an average twenty-seven times less light and heat than we\r\nobtain.\r\n\r\nIn the telescope Jupiter presents an aspect analogous to that likely to\r\nbe exhibited by a world covered with clouds, and enveloped in dense\r\nvapors (Fig. 45).\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, the seat of formidable perturbations, of strange\r\nrevolutions by which it is perpetually convulsed, for although of more\r\nancient formation than the Earth, this celestial giant has not yet\r\narrived at the stable condition of our dwelling-place. Owing to its\r\nconsiderable volume, this globe has probably preserved its original\r\nheat, revolving in space as an obscure Sun, but perhaps still burning.\r\nIn it we see what our own planet must have been in its primordial epoch,\r\nin the pristine times of terrestrial genesis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Telescopic aspect of Jupiter.]\r\n\r\nSince its orbital revolution occupies nearly twelve years, Jupiter\r\ncomes back into opposition with the Sun every 399 days, _i.e._, 1 year,\r\n34 days, that is with one month and four days' delay each year. At these\r\nperiods it is located at the extremity of a straight line which, passing\r\nby the Earth, is prolonged to the Sun. These are the epochs to be\r\nselected for observation. It shines then, all night, like some dazzling\r\nstar of the first magnitude, of excessive whiteness: nor can it be\r\nconfounded either with Venus, more luminous still (for she is never\r\nvisible at midnight, in the full South, but is South-west in the\r\nevening, or South-east in the morning), nor with Mars, whose fires are\r\nruddy.\r\n\r\nIn the telescope, the immense planet presents a superb disk that an\r\nenlargement of forty times shows us to be the same size to all\r\nappearance as that of the Moon seen with the unaided eye. Its shape is\r\nnot absolutely spherical, but spheroid--that is, flattened at the poles.\r\nThe flattening is 1/17.\r\n\r\nWe know that the Earth's axis dips a certain quantity on the plane of\r\nher orbit, and that it is this inclination that produces the seasons.\r\nNow it is not the same for Jupiter. His axis of rotation remains almost\r\nvertical throughout the course of his year, and results in the complete\r\nabsence of climates and seasons. There is neither glacial zone, nor\r\ntropic zone; the position of Jupiter is eternally that of the Earth at\r\nthe season of the equinox, and the vast world enjoys, as it were,\r\nperpetual spring. It knows neither the hoar-frost nor the snows of\r\nwinter. The heat received from the Sun diminishes gradually from the\r\nequator to the poles without abrupt transitions, and the duration of day\r\nand night is equal there throughout the entire year, under every\r\nlatitude. A privileged world, indeed!\r\n\r\nIt is surrounded by a very dense, thick atmosphere, which undergoes more\r\nextensive variations than could be produced by the Sun at such a\r\ndistance. Spectral analysis detects a large amount of water-vapor,\r\nshowing that this planet still possesses a very considerable quantity of\r\nintrinsic heat.\r\n\r\nMost conspicuous upon this globe are the larger or smaller bands or\r\nmarkings (gray and white, sometimes tinted yellow, or of a maroon or\r\nchocolate hue) by which its surface is streaked, particularly in the\r\nvicinity of the equator. These different belts vary, and are constantly\r\nmodified, either in form or color. Sometimes, they are irregular, and\r\ncut up; at others they are interspersed with more or less brilliant\r\npatches. These patches are not affixed to the surface of the globe, like\r\nthe seas and continents of the Earth; nor do they circulate round the\r\nplanet like the satellites, in more or less elongated and regular\r\nrevolutions, but are relatively mobile, like our clouds in the\r\natmosphere, while observation of their motion does not give the exact\r\nperiod of the rotation of Jupiter. Some only appear upon the agitated\r\ndisk to vanish very quickly; others subsist for a considerable period.\r\n\r\nOne has been observed for over a quarter of a century, and appears to be\r\nalmost immobile upon this colossal globe. This spot, which was red at\r\nits first appearance, is now pale and ghostly. It is oval (_vide_ Fig.\r\n45) and measures 42,000 kilometers (26,040 miles) in length by 15,000\r\nkilometers (9,300 miles) in width. Hence it is about four times as long\r\nas the diameter of our Earth; that is, relatively to the size of\r\nJupiter, as are the dimensions of Australia in proportion to our globe.\r\nThe discussion of a larger number of observations leads us to see in it\r\na sort of continent in the making, a scoria recently ejected from the\r\nmobile and still liquid and heated surface of the giant Jupiter. The\r\npatch, however, oscillates perceptibly, and appears to be a floating\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nWe must add that this vast world, like the Sun, _does not rotate all in\r\none period_. Eight different currents can be perceived upon its surface.\r\nThe most rapid is that of the equatorial zone, which accomplishes its\r\nrevolution in 9 hours, 50 minutes, 29 seconds. A point situated on the\r\nequator is therefore carried forward at a speed of 12,500 meters (7\r\nmiles) per second, and it is this giddy velocity of Jupiter that has\r\nproduced the flattening of the poles. From the equator to the poles, the\r\nswiftness of the currents diminishes irregularly, and the difference\r\namounts to about five minutes between the movement of the equatorial\r\nstream, and that of the northern and southern currents. But what is more\r\ncurious still is that the velocity of one and the same stream is subject\r\nto certain fluctuations; thus, in the last quarter of a century, the\r\nspeed of the equatorial current has progressively diminished. In 1879,\r\nthe velocity was 9 hours, 49 minutes, 59 seconds, and now it is, as we\r\nhave already seen, 9 hours, 50 minutes, 29 seconds, which represents a\r\nsubstantial reduction. The rotation of the red patch, at 25 degrees of\r\nthe southern latitude, is effected in 9 hours, 55 minutes, 40 seconds.\r\n\r\nWe are confronted with a strange and mysterious world. It is the world\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\nThis giant gravitates in space accompanied by a suite of five\r\nsatellites. These are:\r\n\r\n       Names.   Distance from surface of Jupiter.

It has so far received no name, and is known as the\r\nfifth, although the four principal are numbered in the order of their\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Jupiter and his four principal satellites.]\r\n\r\nThe four classical satellites are visible in the smallest instruments\r\n(Fig. 46): the third is the most voluminous.\r\n\r\nSuch is the splendid system of the mighty Jupiter. Once, doubtless, this\r\nfine planet illuminated the troop of worlds that derived their treasure\r\nof vitality from him with his intrinsic light: to-day, however, these\r\nmoons in their turn shed upon the extinct central globe the pale soft\r\nlight which they receive from our solar focus, illuminating the brief\r\nJovian nights (which last less than five hours, on account of the\r\ntwilight) with their variable brilliancy.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of the first satellite, Jupiter exhibits a disk\r\n_fourteen hundred times_ vaster than that of the Full Moon! What a\r\ndazzling spectacle, what a fairy scene must the enormous star afford to\r\nthe inhabitants of that tiny world! And what a shabby figure must our\r\nEarth and Moon present in the face of such a body, a real miniature of\r\nthe great solar system!\r\n\r\nOur ancestors were well inspired when they attributed the sovereignty of\r\nOlympus to this majestic planet. His brilliancy corresponds with his\r\nreal grandeur. His dominion in the midnight Heavens is unique. Here\r\nagain, as for Venus, Mars, and Mercury, astronomy has created the legend\r\nof the fables of mythology.\r\n\r\nLet us repeat in conclusion that our Earth becomes practically invisible\r\nfor the inhabitants of the other worlds beyond the distance of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURN\r\n\r\nTurn back now for a moment to the plan of the Solar System.\r\n\r\nWe had to cross 775 million kilometers (480,000,000 miles) when we left\r\nthe Sun, in order to reach the immense orb of Jupiter, which courses in\r\nspace at 626 million kilometers (388,000,000 miles) from the terrestrial\r\norbit. From Jupiter we had to traverse a distance of 646 million\r\nkilometers (400,000,000 miles) in order to reach the marvelous system of\r\nSaturn, where our eyes and thoughts must next alight.\r\n\r\nSon of Uranus and Vesta, Saturn was the God of Time and Fate. He is\r\ngenerally represented as an aged man bearing a scythe. His mythological\r\ncharacter is only the expression of his celestial aspect, as we have\r\nseen for the brilliant Jupiter, for the pale Venus, the ruddy Mars, and\r\nthe agile Mercury. The revolution of Saturn is the slowest of any among\r\nthe planets known to the ancients. It takes almost thirty years for its\r\naccomplishment, and at that distance the Saturnian world, though it\r\nstill shines with the brilliancy of a star of the first magnitude,\r\nexhibits to our eyes a pale and leaden hue. Here is, indeed, the god of\r\nTime, with slow and almost funereal gait.\r\n\r\nPoor Saturn won no favor with the poets and astrologers. He bore the\r\nhorrid reputation of being the inexhaustible source of misfortune and\r\nevil fates,--whereof he is wholly innocent, troubling himself not at all\r\nwith our world nor its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThis world travels in the vastness of the Heavens at a distance of 1,421\r\nmillion kilometers (881,000,000 miles) from the Sun. Hence it is ten\r\ntimes farther from the orb of day than the Earth, though still\r\nilluminated and governed by the Sun-God. Its gigantic orbit is ten times\r\nlarger than our own.\r\n\r\nIts revolution round the Sun is accomplished in 10,759 days, _i.e._, 29\r\nyears, 167 days, and as this strange planet rotates upon itself with\r\ngreat rapidity in 10 hours, 15 minutes, its year comprises no less than\r\n25,217 days. What a calendar! The Saturnians must needs have a\r\nprodigious memory not to get hopelessly involved in this interminable\r\nnumber of days. A curious world, where each year stands for almost\r\nthirty of our own, and where the day is more than half as short again as\r\nours. But we shall presently find other and more extraordinary\r\ndifferences on this planet.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is nearly nine and a half times larger than our\r\nworld. It is a globe, not spherical, but spheroidal, and the flattening\r\nof its poles, which is one-tenth, exceeds that of all the other planets,\r\neven Jupiter. It follows that its equatorial diameter is 112,500\r\nkilometers (69,750 miles), while its polar diameter measures only\r\n110,000 kilometers (68,200).\r\n\r\nIn volume, Saturn is 719 times larger than the Earth, but its density is\r\nonly 128/1000 of our own; _i.e._, the materials of which it is composed\r\nare much less heavy, so that it weighs only 92 times more than our\r\nEarth. Its surface is 85 times vaster than that of the Earth, no\r\ninsignificant proportion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Saturn.]\r\n\r\nThe dipping of Saturn's axis of rotation is much the same as our own.\r\nHence we conclude that the seasons of this planet are analogous to ours\r\nin relative intensity. Only upon this far-off world each season lasts\r\nfor seven years. At the distance at which it gravitates in space, the\r\nheat and light which it receives from the Sun are 90 times less active\r\nthan such as reach our selves; but it apparently possesses an atmosphere\r\nof great density, which may be constituted so that the heat is\r\npreserved, and the planet maintained in a calorific condition but little\r\ninferior to our own.\r\n\r\nIn the telescope, the disk of Saturn exhibits large belts that recall\r\nthose of Jupiter, though they are broader and less accentuated (Fig.\r\n47). There are doubtless zones of clouds or rapid currents circulating\r\nin the atmosphere. Spots are also visible whose displacement assists in\r\ncalculating the diurnal motions of this globe.\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary characteristic of this strange world is, however,\r\nthe existence of a vast _ring_, which is almost flat and very large, and\r\nentirely envelops the body of the planet. It is suspended in the\r\nSaturnian sky, like a gigantic triumphal arch, at a height of some\r\n20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) above the equator. This splendid arch\r\nis circular, like an immense crown illuminated by the Sun. From here we\r\nonly see it obliquely, and it appears to us elliptical; a part of the\r\nring seems to pass in front of Saturn, and its shadow is visible on the\r\nplanet, while the opposite part passes behind.\r\n\r\nThis ring, which measures 284,000 kilometers (176,080 miles) in\r\ndiameter, and less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) in breadth, is divided\r\ninto three distinct zones: the exterior is less luminous than the\r\ncenter, which is always brighter than the planet itself; the interior is\r\nvery dark, and spreads out like a dusky and faintly transparent veil,\r\nthrough which Saturn can be distinguished.\r\n\r\nWhat is the nature of these vast concentric circles that surround the\r\nplanet with a luminous halo? They are composed of an innumerable number\r\nof particles, of a quantity of cosmic fragments, which are swept off in\r\na rapid revolution, and gravitate round the planet at variable speed and\r\ndistance. The nearer particles must accomplish their revolution in 5\r\nhours, 50 minutes, and the most distant in about 12 hours, 5 minutes, to\r\nprevent them from being merged in the surface of Saturn: their own\r\ncentrifugal force sustains them in space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48. Varying perspective of Saturn's Rings, as seen\r\nfrom the Earth.]\r\n\r\nWith a good glass the effect of these rings is most striking, and one\r\ncan not refrain from emotion on contemplating this marvel, whereby one\r\nof the brothers of our terrestrial country is crowned with a golden\r\ndiadem. Its aspects vary with its perspective relative to the Earth, as\r\nmay be seen from the subjoined figure (Fig. 48).\r\n\r\nWe must not quit the Saturnian province without mentioning the eight\r\nsatellites that form his splendid suite:\r\n\r\n  Names.

He replaced the magnification of his\r\ntelescope by more powerful eye-pieces, and found that the apparent\r\ndiameter of the orb increased proportionately with the amplification of\r\nthe power, which does not happen in the case of stars at infinite\r\ndistance. His observations on the following evenings enabled him to note\r\nthe slow and imperceptible movement of this star upon the celestial\r\nsphere, and left him in no further doubt: there was no star, but some\r\nmuch nearer orb, in all probability a comet, for the great astronomer\r\ndared not predict the discovery of a new planet. And it was thus, under\r\nthe name of cometary orb, that the seventh child of the Sun was\r\nannounced. The astronomers sought to determine the motions of the new\r\narrival, to discover for it an elliptical orbit such as most comets\r\nhave. But their efforts were vain, and after several months' study the\r\nconclusion was reached that here was a new planet, throwing back the\r\nlimits of the solar system to a point far beyond that of the Saturnian\r\nfrontier, as admitted from antiquity.\r\n\r\nThis new world received the name of Uranus, father of Saturn, his\r\nnearest neighbor in the solar empire. Uranus shines in the firmament as\r\na small star of sixth magnitude, invisible to the unaided eye for\r\nnormal sight, at a distance of 2,831,000,000 kilometers (1,755,000,000\r\nmiles) from the Sun. Smaller than Jupiter and Saturn, this planet is yet\r\nlarger than Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the Earth together, thus\r\npresenting proportions that claim our respect and admiration.\r\n\r\nHis diameter may be taken at about 55,000 kilometers (34,200 miles),\r\nthat is, rather more than four times the breadth of the terrestrial\r\ndiameter. Sixty-nine times more voluminous than the Earth, and seventeen\r\ntimes more extensive in surface, this new world is much less than our\r\nown in density. The matter of which it is composed is nearly five times\r\nlighter than that of our globe.\r\n\r\nSpectral analysis shows that this distant planet is surrounded with an\r\natmosphere very different from that which we breathe, enclosing gases\r\nthat do not exist in ours.\r\n\r\nThe Uranian globe courses over the fields of infinity in a vast orbit\r\nseventeen times larger than our own, and its revolution lasts 36,688\r\ndays, _i.e._, 84 years, 8 days. It travels slowly and sadly under the\r\npale and languishing rays of the Sun, which sends it nearly three\r\nhundred times less of light and heat than we receive. At this distance\r\nthe solar disk would present a diameter seventeen times smaller than\r\nthat which we admire, and a surface three hundred times less vast. A\r\ndull world indeed! And what an interminable year! The idle people who\r\nare in the habit of being bored must find time even longer upon Uranus\r\nthan upon our little Earth, where the days pass so rapidly. And if\r\nmatters are arranged there as here, a babe of a year old, beginning to\r\nbabble in its nurse's arms, would already have lived as long as an old\r\nman of eighty-four in this world.\r\n\r\nBut what most seriously complicates the Calendar of the Uranians is the\r\nfact that the four moons which accompany the planet accomplish their\r\nrevolution in four different kinds of months, in two, four, eight, and\r\nthirteen days, as is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n                Distance from the planet.

Oberon        600,000       372,000       13     11      7\r\n\r\nThe most curious fact is that these satellites do not rotate like those\r\nof the other planets. While the moons of the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and\r\nSaturn accomplish their revolution from east to west, the satellites of\r\nUranus rotate in a plane almost perpendicular to the ecliptic, and it is\r\ndoubtless the same for the rotation of the planet.\r\n\r\nIf we had to quit the Earth, and fixate ourselves upon another world,\r\nwe should prefer Mars to Uranus, where everything must be so different\r\nfrom terrestrial arrangements? But who knows? Perhaps, after all, this\r\nplanet might afford us some agreeable surprises. _Il ne faut jurer de\r\nrien._\r\n\r\n\r\nNEPTUNE\r\n\r\nAnd here we reach the frontier of the Solar System, as actually known to\r\nus. In landing on the world of Neptune, which circles through the\r\nHeavens in eternal twilight at a distance of more than four milliard\r\nkilometers (2,480,000,000 miles) from the common center of attraction of\r\nthe planetary orbs, we once again admire the prodigies of science.\r\n\r\nUranus was discovered with the telescope, Neptune by calculation. In\r\naddition to the solar influence, the worlds exert a mutual attraction\r\nupon each other that slightly deranges the harmony ordered by the Sun.\r\nThe stronger act upon the weaker, and the colossal Jupiter alone causes\r\nmany of the perturbations in our great solar family. Now during regular\r\nobservations of the position of Uranus in space, some inexplicable\r\nirregularities were soon perceived. The astronomers having full faith in\r\nthe universality of the law of attraction, could not do otherwise than\r\nattribute these irregularities to the influence of some unknown planet\r\nsituated even farther off. But at what distance?\r\n\r\nA very simple proportion, known as Bode's law, has been observed, which\r\nindicates approximately the relative distances of the planets from the\r\nSun. It is as follows: Starting from 0, write the number 3, and double\r\nsuccessively,\r\n\r\n          0  3  6  12  24  48  96  192  384.\r\n\r\nThen, add the number 4 to each of the preceding figures, which gives the\r\nfollowing series:\r\n\r\n          4  7  10  16  28  52  100  196  388.\r\n\r\nNow it is a very curious fact that if the distance between the Earth and\r\nthe Sun be represented by 10, the figure 4 represents the orbit of\r\nMercury, 7 that of Venus, 16 of Mars; the figure 28 stands for the\r\nmedium distance of the minor planets; the distances of Jupiter, Saturn,\r\nand Uranus agree with 52, 100, and 196.\r\n\r\nThe immortal French mathematician Le Verrier, who pursued the solution\r\nof the Uranian problem, supposed naturally that the disturbing planet\r\nmust be at the distance of 388, and made his calculations accordingly.\r\nIts direction in the Heavens was indicated by the form of the\r\ndisturbances; the orbit of Uranus bulging, as it were, on the side of\r\nthe disturbing factor.\r\n\r\nOn August 31, 1846, Le Verrier announced the position of the\r\nultra-Uranian planet, and on September 23d following, a German\r\nastronomer, Galle, at the Observatory of Berlin, who had just received\r\nthis intelligence, pointed his telescope toward the quarter of the\r\nHeavens designated, and, in fact, attested the presence of the new orb.\r\nWithout quitting his study table, Le Verrier, by the sole use of\r\nmathematics, had detected, and, as it were, touched at pen's point the\r\nmysterious stranger.\r\n\r\nOnly, it is proved by observation and calculation that it is less remote\r\nthan was expected from the preceding law, for it gravitates at a\r\ndistance of 300, given that from the Earth to the Sun as 10.\r\n\r\nThis planet was called Neptune, god of the seas, son of Saturn, brother\r\nof Jupiter. The name is well chosen, since the King of the Ocean lives\r\nin darkness in the depths of the sea, and Le Verrier's orb is also\r\nplunged in the semi-obscurity of the depths of the celestial element.\r\nBut it was primarily selected to do justice to an English astronomer,\r\nAdams, who had simultaneously made the same calculations as Le Verrier,\r\nand obtained the same results--without publishing them. His work\r\nremained in the records of the Greenwich Observatory.\r\n\r\nThe English command the seas, and wherever they dip their finger into\r\nthe water and find it salt, they feel themselves \"at home,\" and know\r\nthat \"Neptune's trident is the scepter of the world,\" hence this\r\ncomplimentary nomenclature.\r\n\r\nNeptune is separated by a distance of four milliards, four hundred\r\nmillion kilometers from the solar center.\r\n\r\nAt such a distance, thirty times greater than that which exists between\r\nthe Sun and our world, Neptune receives nine hundred times less light\r\nand heat than ourselves; _i.e._, Spitzbergen and the polar regions of\r\nour globe are furnaces compared with what must be the Neptunian\r\ntemperature. Absolutely invisible to the unaided eye, this world\r\npresents in the telescope the aspect of a star of the eighth magnitude.\r\nWith powerful magnifications it is possible to measure its disk, which\r\nappears to be slightly tinged with blue. Its diameter is four times\r\nlarger than our own, and measures about 48,000 kilometers (29,900\r\nmiles), its surface is sixteen times vaster than that of the Earth, and\r\nto attain its volume we should have to put together fifty-five globes\r\nsimilar to our own. Weight at its surface must be about the same as\r\nhere, but its medium density is only 1/3 that of the Earth.\r\n\r\nIt gravitates slowly, dragging itself along an orbit thirty times vaster\r\nthan that of our globe, and its revolution takes 164 years, 281 days,\r\n_i.e._, 164 years, 9 months. A single year of Neptune thus covers\r\nseveral generations of terrestrial life. Existence must, indeed, be\r\nstrange in that tortoise-footed world!\r\n\r\nWhile in their rotation period, Mercury accomplishes 47 kilometers\r\n(29-3/8 miles) per second, and the Earth 29-1/2 (18-1/8 miles), Neptune\r\nrolls along his immense orbit at a rate of only 5-1/2 kilometers (about\r\n3-1/4 miles) per second.\r\n\r\nThe vast distance that separates us prevents our distinguishing any\r\ndetails of his surface, but spectral analysis reveals the presence of an\r\nabsorbent atmosphere in which are gases unknown to the air of our\r\nplanet, and of which the chemical composition resembles that of the\r\natmosphere of Uranus.\r\n\r\nOne satellite has been discovered for Neptune. It has a considerable\r\ninclination, and rotates from east to west.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd here we have reached the goal of our interplanetary journey. After\r\nvisiting the vast provinces of the solar republic, we feel yet greater\r\nadmiration and gratitude toward the luminary that governs, warms, and\r\nilluminates the worlds of his system.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let us again insist that the Earth,--a splendid orb as\r\nviewed from Mercury, Venus, and Mars,--begins to disappear from Jupiter,\r\nwhere she becomes no more than a tiny spark oscillating from side to\r\nside of the Sun, and occasionally passing in front of him as a small\r\nblack dot. From Saturn the visibility of our planet is even more\r\nreduced. As to Uranus and Neptune, we are invisible there, at least to\r\neyes constructed like our own. We do not possess in the Universe the\r\nimportance with which we would endow ourselves.\r\n\r\nNeptune up to the present guards the portals of our celestial system; we\r\nwill leave him to watch over the distant frontier; but before returning\r\nto the Earth, we must glance at certain eccentric orbs, at the mad,\r\ncapricious comets, which imprint their airy flight upon the realms of\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE COMETS\r\n\r\nSHOOTING STARS, BOLIDES, URANOLITHS OR METEORIC STONES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat marvels have been reviewed by our dazzled eyes since the outset of\r\nthese discussions! We first surveyed the magnificent host of stars that\r\npeople the vast firmament of Heaven; next we admired and wondered at\r\nsuns very differently constituted from our own; then returning from the\r\ndepths of space, crossing at a bound the abyss that separates us from\r\nthese mysterious luminaries, the distant torches of our somber night,\r\nterrible suns of infinity, we landed on our own beloved orb, the superb\r\nand brilliant day-star. Thence we visited his celestial family, his\r\nsystem, in which our Earth is a floating island. But the journey would\r\nbe incomplete if we omitted certain more or less vagabond orbs, that\r\noccasionally approach the Sun and Earth, some of which may even collide\r\nwith us upon their celestial path. These are in the first place the\r\ncomets, then the shooting stars, the fire-balls, and meteorites.\r\n\r\nGlittering, swift-footed heralds of Immensity, these comets with golden\r\nwings glide lightly through Space, shedding a momentary illumination by\r\ntheir presence. Whence come they? Whither are they bound?\r\n\r\nWhat problems they propound to us, when, as in some beautiful display of\r\npyrotechnics, the arch of Heaven is illuminated with their fantastic\r\nlight!\r\n\r\nBut first of all--what is a Comet?\r\n\r\nIf instead of living in these days of the telescope, of spectrum\r\nanalysis, and of astral photography, we were anterior to Galileo, and to\r\nthe liberation of the human spirit by Astronomy, we should reply that\r\nthe comet is an object of terror, a dangerous menace that appears to\r\nmortals in the purity of the immaculate Heavens, to announce the most\r\nfatal misfortunes to the inhabitants of our planet. Is a comet visible\r\nin the Heavens? The reigning prince may make his testament and prepare\r\nto die. Another apparition in the firmament bodes war, famine, the\r\nadvent of grievous pestilence. The astrologers had an open field, and\r\ntheir fertile imagination might hazard every possible conjecture, seeing\r\nthat misfortunes, great or small, are not altogether rare in this\r\nsublunar world.\r\n\r\nHow many intellects, and those not the most vulgar, from antiquity to\r\nthe middle of the last century cursed the apparition of these hirsute\r\nstars, which brought desolation to the heart of man, and poured their\r\nfatal effluvia upon the head of poor Humanity. The history of the\r\nsuperstitions and fears that they inspired of old would furnish matter\r\nfor the most thrilling of romances. But, on the other hand, the volume\r\nwould be little flattering to the common-sense of our ancestors. Despite\r\nthe respect we owe our forefathers, let us recall for a moment the\r\nprejudices attaching to the most famous comets whose passage, as\r\nobserved from the Earth, has been preserved to us in history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Great Comet of 1858.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithout going back to the Deluge, we note that the Romans established a\r\nrelation between the Great Comet of 43 B.C. and the death of Cæsar, who\r\nhad been assassinated a few months previously. It was, they asserted,\r\nthe soul of their great Captain, transported to Heaven to reign in the\r\nempyrean after ruling here below. Were not the Emperors Lords of both\r\nEarth and Heaven?\r\n\r\nWe must in justice recognize that certain more independent spirits\r\nemancipated themselves from these superstitions, and we may cite the\r\nreply of Vespasian to his friends, who were alarmed at the evil presage\r\nof a flaming comet: \"Fear nothing,\" he said, \"this bearded star concerns\r\nme not; rather should it threaten my neighbor the King of the Parthians,\r\nsince he is hairy and I am bald.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 837 one of these mysterious visitants appeared in the\r\nHeavens. It was in the reign of Lewis the Debonair. Directly the King\r\nperceived the comet, he sent for an astrologer, and asked what he was to\r\nconclude from the apparition. As the answers were unsatisfactory he\r\ntried to avert the augury by prayers to Heaven, by ordaining a general\r\nfast to all his Court, and by building churches. Notwithstanding, he\r\ndied three years later, and the historians profited by this slender\r\ncoincidence to set up a correlation between the fatal star and the death\r\nof the Sovereign. This comet, famous in history, is no other than that\r\nof Halley, in one of its appearances.\r\n\r\nThis comet returned to explore the realms near the Sun in 1066, at the\r\nmoment when William of Normandy was undertaking the Conquest of England,\r\nand was misguided enough to go across and reign in London, instead of\r\nstaying at home and annexing England, thus by his action founding the\r\neverlasting rivalry between France and this island. A beneficial\r\ninfluence was attributed to the comet in the Battle of Hastings.\r\n\r\nA few centuries later it again came into sight from the Earth, in 1456,\r\nthree years after the capture of Constantinople by the Turks. Feeling\r\nran high in Europe, and this celestial omen was taken for a proof of the\r\nanger of the Almighty. The moment was decisive; the Christians had to be\r\nrescued from a struggle in which they were being worsted. At this\r\nconjuncture, Pope Calixtus resuscitated a prayer that had fallen into\r\ndisuse, the _Angelus_; and ordered that the bells of the churches should\r\nbe rung each day at noon, that the Faithful might join at the same hour\r\nin prayer against the Turks and the Comet. This custom has lasted down\r\nto our own day.\r\n\r\nAgain, to the comet of 1500 was attributed the tempest that caused the\r\ndeath of Bartholomew Diaz, a celebrated Portuguese navigator, who\r\ndiscovered the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nIn 1528 a bearded star of terrific aspect alarmed the world, and the\r\nmore serious spirits were influenced by this menacing comet, which\r\nburned in the Heavens like \"a great and gory sword.\" In a chapter on\r\nCelestial Monsters the celebrated surgeon Ambroise Paré describes this\r\nawful phenomenon in terms anything but seductive, or reassuring, showing\r\nus the menacing sword surrounded by the heads it had cut off (Fig. 50).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--What our Ancestors saw in a Comet.\r\n\r\n_After Ambroise Paré (1528)._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Prodigies seen in the Heavens by our\r\nForefathers.]\r\n\r\nOmens of battle, 1547.\r\n\r\nDeer and warriors, July 19, 1550.\r\n\r\nCavalry, and a bloody branch crossing the sun, June 11, 1554.]\r\n\r\nOur fathers saw many other prodigies in the skies; their descendants,\r\nless credulous, can study the facsimile reproduced in Fig. 51, of the\r\ndrawings published in the year 1557 by Conrad Lycosthenes in his curious\r\nBook of Prodigies.\r\n\r\nSo, too, it is asserted that Charles V renounced the jurisdiction of his\r\nEstates, which were so vast that \"the Sun never slept upon them,\"\r\nbecause he was terrified by the comet of 1556 which burned in the skies\r\nwith an alarming brilliancy, into passing the rest of his days in prayer\r\nand devotion.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that comets often exhibit very strange characteristics,\r\nbut the imagination that sees in them such dramatic figures must indeed\r\nbe lively. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance these were swords of\r\nfire, bloody crosses, flaming daggers, etc., all horrible objects ready\r\nto destroy our poor human race!\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Romans, Pliny made some curious distinctions between\r\nthem: \"The Bearded Ones let loose their hair like a majestic beard; the\r\nJavelin darts forth like an arrow; if the tail is shorter and ends in a\r\npoint, it is called the Sword; this is the palest of all the Comets; it\r\nshines like a sword, without rays; the Plate or Disk is named in\r\nconformity with its figure; its color is amber, the Barrel is actually\r\nshaped like a barrel, as it might be in smoke, with light streaming\r\nthrough it; the Horn imitates the figure of a horn erected in the sky,\r\nand the Lamp that of a burning flame; the Equine represents a horse's\r\nmane, shaken violently with a circular motion. There are bristled\r\ncomets; these resemble the skins of beasts with the fur on them, and are\r\nsurrounded by a nebulosity. Lastly, the tails of certain comets have\r\nbeen seen to menace the sky in the form of a lance.\"\r\n\r\nThese hairy orbs that appear in all directions, and whose trajectories\r\nare sometimes actually perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic,\r\nappear to obey no regular law. Even in the seventeenth century the\r\nperspicacious Kepler had not divined their true character, seeing in\r\nthem, like most of his contemporaries, emanations from the earth, a sort\r\nof vapor, losing itself in space. These erratic orbs could not be\r\nassimilated with the other members of our grand solar family where,\r\ngenerally speaking, everything goes on in regular order.\r\n\r\nAnd even in our own times, have we not seen the people terrified at the\r\nsight of a flaming comet? Has not the end of the world by the agency of\r\ncomets been often enough predicted? These predictions are so to speak\r\nperiodic; they crop up each time that the return of these cosmical\r\nformations is announced by the astronomers, and always meet with a\r\ncertain number of timid souls who are troubled as to our destinies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo-day we know that these wanderers are subject to the general laws\r\nthat govern the universe. The great Newton announced that, like the\r\nplanets, they were obedient to universal attraction; that they must\r\nfollow an extremely elongated curve, and return periodically to the\r\nfocus of the ellipse. From the basis of these data Halley calculated the\r\nprogress of the comet of 1682, and ascertained that its motions\r\npresented such similarity with the apparitions of 1531 and 1607, that he\r\nbelieved himself justified in identifying them and in announcing its\r\nreturn about the year 1759. Faithful to the call made upon it,\r\nirresistibly attracted by the Orb of Day, the comet, at first pale, then\r\nardent and incandescent, returned at the date assigned to it by\r\ncalculation, three years after the death of the illustrious astronomer.\r\nShining upon his grave it bore witness to the might of human thought,\r\nable to snatch the profoundest secrets from the Heavens!\r\n\r\nThis fine comet returns every seventy-six years, to be visible from the\r\nEarth, and has already been seen twenty-four times by the astonished\r\neyes of man. It appears, however, to be diminishing in magnitude. Its\r\nlast appearance was in 1835, and we shall see it again in 1910, a little\r\nsooner than its average period, the attraction of Jupiter having this\r\ntime slightly accelerated its course, while in 1759 it retarded it.\r\n\r\nThe comets thus follow a very elongated orbit, either elliptic, turning\r\nround the Sun, or parabolic, dashing out into space. In the first case,\r\nthey are periodic (Fig. 52), and their return can be calculated. In the\r\nsecond they surprise us unannounced, and return to the abysses of\r\neternity to reappear no more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--The orbit of a Periodic Comet.]\r\n\r\nTheir speed is even greater than that of the planets, it is equivalent\r\nto this, multiplied by the square root of 2, that is to say by 1.414.\r\nThus at the distance of the Earth from the Sun this velocity = 29,500\r\nmeters (18 miles) per second, multiplied by the above number, that is,\r\n41,700 meters (over 25 miles). At the distance of Mercury it = 47 ×\r\n1.414 or 66,400 meters (over 40 miles) per second.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous comets observed, we do not as yet know more than some\r\ntwenty of which the orbit has been determined. Periodicity in these\r\nbearded orbs is thus exceptional, if we think of the innumerable\r\nmultitude of comets that circle through the Heavens. Kepler did not\r\nexaggerate when he said \"there are as many comets in the skies as there\r\nare fishes in the sea.\" These scouts of the sidereal world constitute a\r\nregular army, and if we are only acquainted with the dazzling generals\r\nclad in gold, it is because the more modest privates can only be\r\ndetected in the telescope. Long before the invention of the latter,\r\nthese wanderers in the firmament roamed through space as in our own day,\r\nbut they defied the human eye, too weak to detect them. Then they were\r\nregarded as rare and terrible objects that no one dared to contemplate.\r\nTo-day they may be counted by hundreds. They have lost in prestige and\r\nin originality; but science is the gainer, since she has thus endowed\r\nthe solar system with new members. No year passes without the\r\nannouncement of three or four new arrivals. But the fine apparitions\r\nthat attract general attention by their splendor are rare enough.\r\n\r\nThese eccentric visitors do not resemble the planets, for they have no\r\nopaque body like the Earth, Venus, Mars, or any of the rest. They are\r\ntransparent nebulosities, of extreme lightness, without mass nor\r\ndensity. We have just photographed the comet of the moment, July, 1903:\r\nthe smallest stars are visible through its tail, and even through the\r\nnucleus.\r\n\r\nThey arrive in every direction from the depths of space, as though to\r\nreanimate themselves in the burning, luminous, electric solar center.\r\n\r\nAttracted by some potent charm toward this dazzling focus, they come\r\ninquisitive and ardent, to warm themselves at its furnace. At first pale\r\nand feeble, they are born again when the Sun caresses them with his\r\nfervid heat. Their motions accelerate, they haste to plunge wholly into\r\nthe radiant light. At length they burst out luminous and superb, when\r\nthe day-star penetrates them with his burning splendor, illuminates them\r\nwith a marvelous radiance, and crowns them with glory. But the Sun is\r\ngenerous. Having showered benefits upon these gorgeous celestial\r\nbutterflies that flutter round him as round some altar of the gods, he\r\ngrants them liberty to visit other heavens, to seek fresh universes....\r\n\r\nThe original parabola is converted into an ellipse, if the imprudent\r\nadventurer in returning to the Sun passes near some great planet, such\r\nas Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune, and suffers its attraction. It\r\nis then imprisoned by our system, and can no longer escape from it.\r\nAfter reenforcement at the solar focus, it must return to the identical\r\npoint at which it felt the first pangs of a new destiny. Henceforward,\r\nit belongs to our celestial family, and circles in a closed curve.\r\nOtherwise, it is free to continue its rapid course toward other suns and\r\nother systems.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the telescope shows three distinct parts in a comet. There is\r\nfirst the more brilliant central point, or _nucleus_, surrounded by a\r\nnebulosity called the _hair_, or _brush_, and prolonged in a luminous\r\nappendix stretching out into the _tail_. The _head_ of the comet is the\r\nbrush and the nucleus combined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--The tails of Comets are opposed to the Sun.]\r\n\r\nIt is usually supposed that the tail of a comet follows it throughout\r\nthe course of its peregrinations. Nothing of the kind. The appendix may\r\neven precede the nucleus; it is always opposite the Sun,--that is to\r\nsay, it is situated on the prolongation of a straight line, starting\r\nfrom the Sun, and passing through the nucleus (Fig. 53). The tail does\r\nnot exist, so long as the comet is at a distance from the orb of day;\r\nbut in approaching the Sun, the nebulosity is heated and dilates, giving\r\nbirth to those mysterious tails and fantastic streamers whose\r\ndimensions vary considerably for each comet. The dilations and\r\ntransformations undergone by the tail suggest that they may be due to a\r\nrepulsive force emanating from the Sun, an electric charge transmitted\r\ndoubtless through the ether. It is as though Phoebus blew upon them\r\nwith unprecedented force.\r\n\r\nTelescopic comets are usually devoid of tail, even when they reach the\r\nvicinity of the Sun. They appear as pale nebulosities, rounded or oval,\r\nmore condensed toward the center, without, however, showing any distinct\r\nnucleus. These stars are only visible for a minute fraction of their\r\ncourse, when they reach a point not far from the Sun and the terrestrial\r\norbit.\r\n\r\nThe finest comets of the last century were those of 1811, 1843, 1858,\r\n1861, 1874, 1880, 1881, and 1882. The Great Comet of 1811, after\r\nspreading terror over certain peoples, notably in Russia, became the\r\nprovidence of the vine-growers. As the wine was particularly good and\r\nabundant that year, the peasants attributed this happy result to the\r\ninfluence of the celestial visitant.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 one of these strange messengers from the Infinite appeared in\r\nour Heavens. It was so brilliant that it was visible in full daylight on\r\nFebruary 28th, alongside of the Sun. This splendid comet was\r\naccompanied by a marvelous rectilinear tail measuring 300,000,000\r\nkilometers (186,000,000 miles) in length, and its flight was so rapid\r\nthat it turned the solar hemisphere at perihelion in two hours,\r\nrepresenting a speed of 550 kilometers (342 miles) a second.\r\n\r\nBut the most curious fact is that this radiant apparition passed so near\r\nthe Sun that it must have traversed its flames, and yet emerged from\r\nthem safe and sound.\r\n\r\nNoteworthy also was the comet of 1858 (Fig. 49), discovered at Florence\r\nby Donati. Its tail extended to a length of 90,000,000 kilometers\r\n(55,900,000 miles), and its nucleus had a diameter of at least 900\r\nkilometers (559 miles). It is a curious coincidence that the wine was\r\nremarkably excellent and abundant in that year also.\r\n\r\nThe comet of 1861 almost rivaled the preceding.\r\n\r\nCoggia's Comet, in 1874, was also remarkable for its brilliancy, but was\r\nvery inferior to the last two. Finally, the latest worthy of mention\r\nappeared in 1882. This magnificent comet also touched the Sun, traveling\r\nat a speed of 480 kilometers (299 miles) per second. It crossed the\r\ngaseous atmosphere of the orb of day, and then continued its course\r\nthrough infinity. On the day of, and that following, its perihelion, it\r\ncould be detected with the unaided eye in full daylight, enthroned in\r\nthe Heavens beside the dazzling solar luminary. For the rest, it was\r\nneither that of 1858 nor of 1861.\r\n\r\nSince 1882 we have not been favored with a visit from any fine comet;\r\nbut we are prepared to give any such a reception worthy of their\r\nmagnificence: first, because now that we have fathomed them we are no\r\nlonger awestruck; second, because we would gladly study them more\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn short, these hirsute stars, whose fantastic appearance impressed the\r\nimagination of our ancestors so vividly, are no longer formidable. Their\r\nmass is inconsiderable; they seem to consist mainly of the lightest of\r\ngases. Analysis of their incandescence reveals a spectrum closely\r\nresembling that of many nebulæ; the presence of carbon is more\r\nparticularly obvious. Even the nucleus is not solid, and is often\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\nIt is fair to say that the action of a comet might be deleterious if one\r\nof these orbs were to arrive directly upon us. The transformation of\r\nmotion into heat, and the combination of the cometary gases with the\r\noxygen of our atmosphere might produce a conflagration, or a general\r\npoisoning of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBut the collision of a comet with a planet is almost an impossibility.\r\nThis phenomenon could only occur if the comet crossed the planetary\r\norbit at the exact moment at which the planet was passing. When we\r\nthink of the immensity of space, of the extraordinary length of way\r\ntraversed by a world in its annual journey round the Sun, and the speed\r\nof its rotation, we see why this coincidence is hardly likely to occur.\r\nThus, among the hundreds of comets catalogued, a few only cut the\r\nterrestrial orbit. One of them, that of 1832, traversed the path of our\r\nglobe in the nights of October 29 and 30 in that year; but the Earth\r\nonly passed the same point thirty days later, and at the critical period\r\nwas more than 80,000,000 kilometers (50,000,000 miles) away from the\r\ncomet.\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1861, however, the Earth passed through the extremity of the\r\ntail of the Great Comet of that year. No one even noticed it. The\r\neffects were doubtless quite immaterial.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 we were to collide with Biela's Comet, lost since 1852; now, as\r\nwe shall presently see, we came with flying colors out of that\r\ndisagreeable situation, because the comet had disintegrated, and was\r\nreduced to powder. So we may sleep in peace as regards future danger\r\nlikely to come to us from comets. There is little fear of the\r\ndestruction of humanity by these windy bags.\r\n\r\nThese ethereal beauties whose blond locks float carelessly upon the\r\nazure night are not concerned with us; they seem to have no other\r\npreoccupation than to race from sun to sun, visiting new Heavens,\r\nindifferent to the astonishment they produce in us. They speed\r\nrestlessly and tirelessly through infinity; they are the Amazons of\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nWhat suns, what worlds must they have visited since the moment of their\r\nbirth! If these splendid fugitives could relate the story of their\r\nwanderings, how gladly should we listen to the enchanting descriptions\r\nof the various abodes they have journeyed to! But alas! these mysterious\r\nexplorers are dumb; they tell none of their secrets, and we must needs\r\nrespect their enigmatic silence.\r\n\r\nYet, some of them have left us a modest token of remembrance, an almost\r\nimpalpable nothing, sufficient, however, to enable us to address our\r\nthanks to the considerate messenger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCan there be any one upon the Earth who has not been struck by the\r\nphosphorescent lights that glide through the somber night, leaving a\r\nbrilliant silver or golden track--the luminous, ephemeral trail of a\r\nmeteor?\r\n\r\nSometimes, when Night has silently spread the immensity of her wings\r\nabove the weary Earth, a shining speck is seen to detach itself in the\r\nshades of evening from the starry vault, shooting lightly through the\r\nconstellations to lose itself in the infinitude of space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--A Meteor.]\r\n\r\nThese bewitching sparks attract our eyes and chain our senses.\r\nFascinating celestial fireflies, their dainty flames dart in every\r\ndirection through space, sowing the fine dust of their gilded wings upon\r\nthe fields of Heaven. They are born to die; their life is only a breath;\r\nyet the impression which they make upon the imagination of mortals is of\r\nthe profoundest.\r\n\r\nThe young girl dreaming in the delicious tranquillity of the transparent\r\nnight smiles at this charming sister in the Heavens (Fig. 54). What can\r\nnot this adorable star announce to the tender and loving heart? Is it\r\nthe shy messenger of the happiness so long desired? Its unpremeditated\r\nappearance fills the soul with a ray of hope and makes it tremble. It is\r\na golden beam that glides into the heart, expanding it in the thrills of\r\na sudden and ephemeral pleasure.... The radiant meteor seems to quit the\r\nvelvet of the deep blue sky to respond to the appeal of the imploring\r\nvoice that seeks its succor.\r\n\r\nWhat secrets has it not surprised! And who bears malice against it? It\r\nis the friend of the betrothed who invoke its passage to confide their\r\nwishes, and associate it with their dreams. Tradition holds that if a\r\nwish be formulated during the visible passage of a meteor it will\r\ncertainly be fulfilled before the year is out. Between ourselves,\r\nhowever, this is but a surviving figment of the ancestral imagination,\r\nfor this celestial jewel takes no such active part in the doings of\r\nHumanity.... Besides, try to express a wish distinctly in a second!\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that while comets have so often spread terror on\r\nthe Earth, shooting stars should on the contrary have been regarded with\r\nbenevolent feelings at all times. And what is a shooting star? These\r\ndainty excursionists from the celestial shores are not, as is supposed,\r\ntrue stars. They are atoms, nothings, minute fragments deriving in\r\ngeneral from the disintegration of comets. They come to us from a vast\r\ndistance, from millions on millions of miles, and circle in swarms\r\naround the Sun, following a very elongated ellipse which closely\r\nresembles that of the cometary orbit. Their flight is extremely rapid,\r\nreaching sometimes more than 40 kilometers (25 miles) per second, a\r\ncometary speed that is, as we have seen, greatly above that of our\r\nterrestrial vehicle, which amounts to 29 to 30 kilometers (about 19\r\nmiles).\r\n\r\nThese little corpuscles are not intrinsically luminous; but when the\r\norbit of a swarm of meteors crosses our planet, a violent shock arises,\r\nthe speed of which may be as great as 72 kilometers (45 miles) in the\r\nfirst second if we meet the star shower directly; the average rate,\r\nhowever, does not exceed 30 to 40 kilometers (19 to 25 miles), for these\r\nmeteors nearly always cross our path obliquely. The height at which they\r\narrive is usually 110 kilometers (68 miles), and 80 kilometers (50\r\nmiles) at the moment of disappearance of the meteor; but shooting stars\r\nhave been observed at 300 kilometers (186 miles).\r\n\r\nThe friction caused by this collision high up in the atmosphere\r\ntransforms the motion into heat. The molecules incandesce, and burn like\r\ntrue stars with a brilliancy that is often magnificent.\r\n\r\nBut their glory is of short duration. The excessive heat resulting from\r\nthe shock consumes the poor firefly; its remains evaporate, and drop\r\nslowly to the Earth, where they are deposited on the surface of the soil\r\nin a sort of ferruginous dust mixed with carbon and nickel. Some one\r\nhundred and forty-six milliards of them reach us annually, as seen by\r\nthe unaided eye, and many more in the telescope; the effect of these\r\nshowers of meteoric matter is an insensible increase in the mass of our\r\nglobe, a slight lessening of its rotary motion, and the acceleration of\r\nthe lunar movements of revolution.\r\n\r\nAlthough the appearance of shooting stars is a common enough phenomenon,\r\nvisible every night of the year, there are certain times when they\r\narrive in swarms, from different quarters of the sky. The most\r\nremarkable dates in this connection are the night of August 10th and the\r\nmorning of November 14th. Every one knows the shooting stars of August\r\n10th, because they arrive in the fine warm summer evenings so favorable\r\nto general contemplation of the Heavens. The phenomenon lasts till the\r\n12th, and even beyond, but the maximum is on the 10th. When the sky is\r\nvery clear, and there is no moon, hundreds of shooting stars can be\r\ncounted on those three nights, sometimes thousands. They all seem to\r\ncome from the same quarter of the Heavens, which is called the\r\n_radiant_, and is situated for the August swarm in the constellation of\r\nPerseus, whence they have received the name of _Perseids_. Our\r\nforefathers also called them the tears of St. Lawrence, because the\r\nfeast of that saint is on the same date. These shooting stars describe a\r\nvery elongated ellipse, and their orbit has been identified with that of\r\nthe Great Comet of 1862.\r\n\r\nThe shower of incandescent asteroids on November 14th is often much more\r\nabundant than the preceding. In 1799, 1833, and 1866, the meteors were\r\nso numerous that they were described as showers of rain, especially on\r\nthe first two dates. For several hours the sky was furrowed with falling\r\nstars. An English mariner, Andrew Ellicot, who made the drawing we\r\nreproduce (Fig. 55), described the phenomenon as stupendous and alarming\r\n(November 12, 1799, 3 A.M.). The same occurred on November 13, 1833. The\r\nmeteors that scarred the Heavens on that night were reckoned at 240,000.\r\nThese shooting stars received the name of _Leonids_, because their\r\nradiant is situated in the constellation of the Lion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Shooting Stars of November 12, 1799.\r\n\r\n_From a contemporary drawing._]\r\n\r\nThis swarm follows the same orbit as the comet of 1866, which travels as\r\nfar as Uranus, and comes back to the vicinity of the Sun every\r\nthirty-three years. Hence we were entitled to expect another splendid\r\napparition in 1899, but the expectations of the astronomers were\r\ndisappointed. All the preparations for the appropriate reception of\r\nthese celestial visitors failed to bring about the desired result. The\r\nnotes made in observatories, or in balloons, admitted of the\r\nregistration of only a very small number of meteors. The maximum was\r\nthirteen. During that night, some 200 shooting stars were counted. There\r\nwere more in 1900, 1901, and, above all, in 1902. This swarm has become\r\ndisplaced.\r\n\r\nThe night of November 27th again is visited by a number of shooting\r\nstars that are the disaggregated remains of the Comet of Biela. This\r\ncomet, discovered by Biela in 1827, accomplished its revolution in six\r\nand a half years, and down to 1846 it responded punctually to the\r\nastronomers who expected its return as fixed by calculation. But on\r\nJanuary 13, 1846, the celestial wanderer broke in half: each fragment\r\nwent its own way, side by side, to return within sight from the Earth in\r\n1852. It was their last appearance. That year the twin comets could\r\nstill be seen, though pale and insignificant. Soon they vanished into\r\nthe depths of night, and never appeared again. They were looked for in\r\nvain, and were despaired of, when on November 27, 1872, instead of the\r\nshattered comet, came a magnificent rain of shooting stars. They fell\r\nthrough the Heavens, numerous as the flakes of a shower of snow.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomenon recurred on November 27, 1885, and confirmed the\r\nhypothesis of the demolition and disaggregation of Biela's Comet into\r\nshooting stars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is an immense variety in the brilliancy of the shooting stars,\r\nfrom the weak telescopic sparks that vanish like a flash of lightning,\r\nto the incandescent _bolides_ or _fire-balls_ that explode in the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nFig. 56 shows an example of these, and it represents a fire-ball\r\nobserved at the Observatory of Juvisy on the night of August 10, 1899.\r\nIt arrived from Cassiopeia, and burst in Cepheus.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon may occur by day as well as by night. It is often\r\naccompanied by one or several explosions, the report of which is\r\nsometimes perceptible to a considerable distance, and by a shower of\r\nmeteorites. The globe of fire bursts, and splits up into luminous\r\nfragments, scattered in all directions. The different parts of the\r\nfire-ball fall to the surface of the Earth, under the name of aerolites,\r\nor rather of uranoliths, since they arrive from the depths of space, and\r\nnot from our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFrom the most ancient times we hear of showers of uranoliths to which\r\npopular superstitions were attached; and the Greeks even gave the name\r\nof _Sideros_ to iron, the first iron used having been sidereal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Fire-Ball seen from the Observatory at Juvisy,\r\nAugust 10, 1899.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Explosion of a Fire-Ball above Madrid,\r\nFebruary 10, 1896.]\r\n\r\nNo year passes without the announcement of several showers of\r\nuranoliths, and the phenomenon sometimes causes great alarm to those who\r\nwitness it. One of the most remarkable explosions is that which occurred\r\nabove Madrid, February 10, 1896, a fragment from which, sent me by M.\r\nArcimis, Director of the Meteorological Institute, fell immediately in\r\nfront of the National Museum (Fig. 57). The phenomenon occurred at 9.30\r\nA.M., in brilliant sunshine. The flash of the explosion was so dazzling\r\nthat it even illuminated the interior of the houses; an alarming clap of\r\nthunder was heard seventy seconds after, and it was believed that an\r\nexplosion of dynamite had occurred. The fire-ball burst at a height of\r\nfourteen miles, and was seen as far as 435 miles from Madrid!\r\n\r\nIn one of Raphael's finest pictures (_The Madonna of Foligno_) a\r\nfire-ball may be seen beneath a rainbow (Fig. 58), the painter wishing\r\nto preserve the remembrance of it, as it fell near Milan, on September\r\n4, 1511. This picture dates from 1512.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of these meteorites vary considerably; they are of all\r\nsizes, from the impalpable dust that floats in the air, to the enormous\r\nblocks exposed in the Museum of Natural History in Paris. Many of them\r\nweigh several million pounds. That represented below fell in Mexico\r\nduring the shower of meteors of November 27, 1885. It weighed about four\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Raphael's Fire-Ball (_The Madonna of\r\nFoligno_).]\r\n\r\nThese bolides and uranoliths come to us from the depths of space; but\r\nthey do not appear to have the same origin as the shooting stars. They\r\nmay arise from worlds destroyed by explosion or shock, or even from\r\nplanetary volcanoes. The lightest of them may have been expelled from\r\nthe volcanoes of the Moon. Some of the most massive, in which iron\r\npredominates, may even have issued from the bowels of the Earth,\r\nprojected into space by some volcanic explosion, at an epoch when our\r\nglobe was perpetually convulsed by cataclysms of extraordinary violence.\r\nThey return to us to-day after being removed from the Earth to distances\r\nproportional to the initial speed imparted to them. This origin seems\r\nthe more admissible as the stones that fall from the skies exhibit a\r\nmineral composition identical with that of the terrestrial materials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--A Uranolith.]\r\n\r\nIn any case, these uranoliths bring us back at least by their fall to\r\nour Earth, and from henceforward we will remain upon it, to study its\r\nposition in space, and to take account of the place it fills in the\r\nUniverse, and of the astronomical laws that govern our destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nOur grand celestial journey lands us upon our own little planet, on this\r\nglobe that gravitates between Mars and Venus (between War and Love),\r\ncirculating like her brothers of the solar system, around the colossal\r\nSun.\r\n\r\nThe Earth! The name evokes in us the image of Life, and calls up the\r\ntheater of our activities, our ambitions, our joys and sorrows. Does it\r\nnot, in fact, to ignorant eyes, represent the whole of the universe?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, what is the Earth?\r\n\r\nThe Earth is a star in the Heavens. We learned this much in our first\r\nlesson. It is a globe of opaque material, similar to the planets\r\nMercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc., as previously described. Isolated\r\non all sides in space, it revolves round the Sun, along a vast orbit\r\nthat it accomplishes in a year. And while it thus glides along the lines\r\nof solar attraction, the terrestrial ball rotates rapidly upon itself in\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThese statements may appear dubious at first sight, and contradictory to\r\nthe evidence of our senses.\r\n\r\nNow that the surface of the Earth has been explored in all directions,\r\nthere is no longer room to doubt that it is a globe, a sort of ball that\r\nwe adhere to. A journey round the world is common enough to-day, and\r\nalways yields the most complete evidence of the spherical nature of the\r\nEarth. On the other hand, the curvature of the seas is a no less certain\r\nproof. When a ship reaches the dark-blue line that appears to separate\r\nthe sky from the ocean, it seems to be hanging on the horizon. Little by\r\nlittle, however, as it recedes, it drops below the horizon line; the\r\ntops of the masts being the last to disappear. The observer on board\r\nship witnesses the same phenomenon. The low shores are first to\r\ndisappear, while the high coasts and mountains are much longer visible.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the Heavens gives another proof of the Earth's rotundity.\r\nAs one travels North or South, new stars rise higher and higher above\r\nthe horizon in the one direction or the other, and those which shine in\r\nthe latitude one is leaving, gradually disappear. If the surface of the\r\nEarth were flat, the ships on the sea would be visible as long as our\r\nsight could pierce the distance, and all the stars of the Heavens would\r\nbe equally visible from the different quarters of the world.\r\n\r\nLastly, during the eclipses of the Moon, the shadow projected by the\r\nEarth upon our satellite is always round. This is another proof of the\r\nspherical nature of the terrestrial globe.\r\n\r\nWe described the Earth as an orb in the Heavens, similar to all the\r\nother planets of the great solar family. We see these sister planets of\r\nour world circulating under the starry vault, like luminous points whose\r\nbrilliancy is sometimes dazzling. For us they are marvelous celestial\r\nbirds hovering in the ether, upheld by invisible wings. The Earth is\r\njust the same. It is supported by nothing. Like the soap-bubble that\r\nassumes a lovely iridescence in the rays of the Sun, or, better, like\r\nthe balloon rapidly cleaving the air, it is isolated from every kind of\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nSome minds have difficulty in conceiving this isolation, because they\r\nform a false notion of weight.\r\n\r\nThe astronomers of antiquity, who divined it, knew not how to prevent\r\nthe Earth from falling. They asked anxiously what the strong bands\r\ncapable of holding up this block of no inconsiderable weight could be.\r\nAt first they thought it floated on the waters like an island. Then they\r\npostulated solid pillars, or even supposed it might turn on pivots\r\nplaced at the poles. But on what would all these imaginary supports have\r\nrested? All these fanciful foundations of the Earth had to be given up,\r\nand it was recognized as a globe, isolated in every part. This illusion\r\nof the ancients, which still obtains for a great many citizens of our\r\nglobule, arises, as we said, from a false conception of weight.\r\n\r\nWeight and attraction are one and the same force.\r\n\r\nA body can only fall when it is attracted, drawn by a more important\r\nbody. Now, in whatever direction we may wander upon the globe, our feet\r\nare always downward. _Down_ is therefore the _center_ of the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial globe may be regarded as an immense ball of magnet, and\r\nits attraction holds us at its surface. We weigh toward the center. We\r\nmay travel over this surface in all directions; our feet will always be\r\nbelow, whatever the direction of our steps. For us, \"below\" is the\r\ninside of our planet, and \"above\" is the immensity of the Heavens that\r\nextend above our heads, right round the globe.\r\n\r\nThis once understood, where could the Earth fall to? The question is an\r\nabsurdity. \"Below\" being toward the center, it would have to fall out of\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nLet us then picture the Earth as a vast sphere, detached from all that\r\nexists around it, in the infinity of the Heavens. A point diametrically\r\nopposed to another is called its _antipodes_. New Zealand is\r\napproximately the antipodes to France. Well, for the inhabitants of New\r\nZealand and of France the top is reciprocally opposed, and the bottom,\r\nor the feet, are diametrically in opposition. And yet, for one as for\r\nthe other, the bottom is the soil they are held to, and the top is\r\nspace above their heads.\r\n\r\nThe Earth turns on itself in twenty-four hours. Whatever is above us,\r\n_e.g._, at midday, we call high; twelve hours later, at midnight, we\r\ngive the same qualification to the part of space that was under our feet\r\nat noon. What is in the sky, and over our heads, at a given hour, is\r\nunder our feet, and yet always in the sky, twelve hours later. Our\r\nposition, in relation to the space that surrounds us, changes from hour\r\nto hour, and \"top\" and \"bottom\" vary also, relatively to our position.\r\n\r\nOur planet is thus a ball, slightly flattened at the poles (by about\r\n1/292). Its diameter, at the equator, is 12,742 kilometers (7,926\r\nmiles); from one pole to the other is a little less, owing to the\r\nflattening of the polar caps. The difference is some 43 kilometers\r\n(about 27 miles).\r\n\r\nIts circumference is 40,000 kilometers (24,900 miles). This ball is\r\nsurrounded by an aerial envelope, the atmosphere, the height of which\r\ncan not be less than 300 kilometers (186 miles), according to the\r\nobservations made on certain shooting stars.\r\n\r\nWe all know that this layer of air, at the bottom of which we live, is a\r\nbeautiful azure blue that seems to separate us from the sidereal abyss,\r\nspreading over our heads in a kind of vault that is often filled with\r\nclouds, and giving the illusion of resting far off on the circle of the\r\nhorizon. But this is only an illusion. In reality, there is neither\r\nvault nor horizon; space is open in all directions. If the atmosphere\r\ndid not exist, or if it were completely transparent, we should see the\r\nstars by day as by night, for they are continually round us, at noon as\r\nat midnight, and we can see them in the full daylight, with the help of\r\nastronomical instruments. In fact, certain stars (the radiant Venus and\r\nthe dazzling Jupiter) pierce the veil of the atmosphere, and are visible\r\nwith the unaided eye in full daylight.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial surface is 510,000,000 square kilometers (200,000,000\r\nsquare miles). The waters of the ocean cover three-quarters of this\r\nsurface, _i.e._, 383,200,000 square kilometers (150,000,000 square\r\nmiles), and the continents only occupy 136,600,000 square kilometers\r\n(55,000 square miles). France represents about the thousandth part of\r\nthe total superficies of the globe.\r\n\r\nDespite the asperities of mountain ranges, and the abysses hollowed out\r\nby the waters, the terrestrial globe is fairly regular, and in relation\r\nto its volume its surface is smoother than that of an orange. The\r\nhighest summits of the Himalaya, the profoundest depths of the somber\r\nocean, do not attain to the millionth part of its diameter.\r\n\r\nIn weight, the Earth is five and a half times heavier than would be a\r\nglobe of water of the same dimensions. That is to say:\r\n\r\n          6,957,930,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms\r\n          (6,833,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons).\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric atmosphere with which it is surrounded represents.\r\n\r\n          6,263,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms\r\n          (6,151,000,000,000,000 tons).\r\n\r\nEach of us carries an average weight of some 17,000 kilograms (16 tons)\r\nupon his shoulders. Perhaps some one will ask how it is that we are not\r\ncrushed by this weight, which is out of all proportion with our\r\nstrength, but to which, nevertheless, we appear insensible. It is\r\nbecause the aerial fluid enclosed within our bodies exerts a pressure\r\nequal and opposite to the external atmospheric pressure, and these\r\npressures are at equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe Earth is characterized by no essential or particular differences\r\nrelatively to the other worlds of our system. Like Venus of the limpid\r\nrays, like the dazzling Jupiter, like all the planets, she courses\r\nthrough space, carrying into Infinitude our hopes and destinies. Bigger\r\nthan Mercury, Venus, and Mars, she presents a very modest figure in\r\ncomparison with the enormous Jupiter, the strange system of Saturn, of\r\nUranus, and even of Neptune. For us her greatest interest is that she\r\nserves as our residence, and if she were not our habitation we should\r\nscarcely notice her. Dark in herself, she burns at a distance like a\r\nstar, returning to space the light she receives from the Sun. At the\r\ndistance of our satellite, she shines like an enormous moon, fourteen\r\ntimes larger and more luminous than our gentle Phoebe. Observed from\r\nMercury or Venus, she embellishes the midnight sky with her sparkling\r\npurity as Jupiter does for us. Seen from Mars, she is a brilliant\r\nmorning and evening star, presenting phases similar to those which Mars\r\nand Venus show from here. From Jupiter, the terrestrial globe is little\r\nmore than an insignificant point, nearly always swallowed up in the\r\nsolar rays. As to the Saturnians, Uranians, and Neptunians, if such\r\npeople exist, they probably ignore our existence altogether. And in all\r\nlikelihood it is the same for the rest of the universe.\r\n\r\nWe must cherish no illusions as to the importance of our natal world. It\r\nis true that the Earth is not wanting in charm, with its verdant plains\r\nenameled in the delicious tones of a robust and varied vegetation, its\r\nplants and flowers, its spring-time and its birds, its limpid rivers\r\nwinding through the meadows, its mountains covered with forests, its\r\nvast and profound seas animated with an infinite variety of living\r\ncreatures. The spectacle of Nature is magnificent, superb, admirable\r\nand marvelous, and we imagine that this Earth fills the universe, and\r\nsuffices for it. The Sun, the Moon, the stars, the boundless Heavens,\r\nseem to have been created for us, to charm our eyes and thoughts, to\r\nillumine our days, and shed a gentle radiance upon our nights. This is\r\nan agreeable illusion of our senses. If our Humanity were extinguished,\r\nthe other worlds of the Heavens, Venus, Mars, etc., would none the less\r\ncontinue to gravitate in the Heavens along with our defunct planet, and\r\nthe close of human life (for which everything seems to us to have been\r\ncreated) would not even be perceived by those other worlds, that\r\nnevertheless are our neighbors. There would be no revolution, no\r\ncataclysm. The stars would go on shining in the firmament, just as they\r\ndo to-day, shedding their divine light over the immensity of the\r\nHeavens. Nothing would be changed in the general aspect of the Universe.\r\nThe Earth is only a modest atom, lost in the innumerable army of the\r\nworlds and suns that people the universe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery morning the Sun rises in the East, setting fire with his ardent\r\nrays to the sky, which is dazzling with his splendor. He ascends through\r\nspace, reaches a culminating point at noon, and then descends toward the\r\nWest, to sink at night into the purple of the sunset.\r\n\r\nAnd then the stars, grand lighthouses of the Heavens, in their turn\r\nincandesce. They too rise in the East, ascend the vault of Heaven, and\r\nthen descend to the West, and vanish. All the orbs, Sun, Moon, planets,\r\nstars, appear to revolve round us in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThis journey of the orbs around us is only an illusion of the senses.\r\n\r\nWhether the Earth be at rest, and the sky animated with a rotary\r\nmovement round her, or whether, on the contrary, the stars are fixed,\r\nand the Earth in motion, in either case, for us appearances are the\r\nsame. If the Earth turns, carrying all that pertains to it in its\r\nmotion--the seas, the atmosphere, the clouds, and ourselves,--we are\r\nunable to perceive it, because all the objects that surround us keep\r\ntheir respective positions among themselves. Hence we must resort to\r\nlogic, and reason out the two hypotheses.\r\n\r\nFor the accomplishment of this rapid journey of the Sun and stars around\r\nthe Earth, it would be necessary that all the orbs of the sky should be\r\nin some way attached to a vault, or to circles, as was formerly\r\nsupposed. This conception is childish. The peoples of antiquity had no\r\nnotion of the size of the universe, and their error is almost excusable.\r\nThe distance separating Heaven from the Infernal Regions has been\r\nmeasured, according to Hesiod, by Vulcan's anvil, which fell from the\r\nskies to the Earth in nine days and nine nights, and it would have\r\ntaken as long again to continue its journey from the surface of the\r\nEarth to the bowels of Hades.\r\n\r\nTo-day we have a more exact notion of the grandeur of the Universe. We\r\nknow that millions and trillions of miles separate the stars from one\r\nanother. And by representing these distances, we can form some idea of\r\nthe difficulty there would be in admitting the rotation of the universe\r\nround the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe distance from here to the Sun is 149,000,000 kilometers (93,000,000\r\nmiles). In order to turn in twenty-four hours round the Earth, that orb\r\nwould have to fly through Space at a velocity of more than 10,000\r\nkilometers (6,200 miles) a second.\r\n\r\nYes! the Sun, splendid orb, source of our existence and of that of all\r\nthe planets, a colossal globe, over a million times more voluminous than\r\nthe Earth, and 324 thousand times heavier, would have to accomplish this\r\nimmense revolution in order to turn round the minute point that is our\r\nlilliputian world!\r\n\r\nThis in itself would suffice to convince us of the want of logic in such\r\nan argument. But the Sun is not alone in the Heavens. We should have to\r\nsuppose that all the planets and all the stars were engaged in the same\r\nfantastic motions.\r\n\r\nJupiter is about five times as far off as the Sun; his velocity would\r\nhave to be 53,000 kilometers (32,860 miles) per second.\r\n\r\nNeptune, thirty times farther off, would have to execute 320,000\r\nkilometers (198,000 miles) per second.\r\n\r\nThe nearest star, [alpha] of the Centaur, situated at a distance 275,000\r\ntimes that of the Sun, would have to run, to fly through space, at a\r\nrate of 2,941,000,000 kilometers (1,823,420,000 miles) per second.\r\n\r\nAll the other stars are incomparably farther off, at infinity.\r\n\r\nAnd this fantastic rotation would all be accomplished round a minute\r\npoint!\r\n\r\nTo put the problem in this way is to solve it. Unless we deny the\r\nastronomic measures, and the most convincing geometric operations, the\r\nEarth's diurnal motion of rotation is a certainty.\r\n\r\nTo suppose that the stars revolve round the Earth is to suppose, as one\r\nauthor humorously suggests, that in order to roast a pheasant the\r\nchimney, the kitchen, the house, and all the countryside must needs turn\r\nround it.\r\n\r\nIf the Earth turns in twenty-four hours upon itself, a point upon the\r\nequator would simply travel at a rate of 465 meters (1,525 feet) per\r\nsecond. This speed, while considerable in comparison with the movements\r\nobserved upon the surface of our planet, is as nothing compared with\r\nthe fantastic rapidity at which the Sun and stars would have to move, in\r\norder to rotate round our globe.\r\n\r\nThus we have to choose between these two hypotheses: either to make the\r\nentire Heavens turn round us in twenty-four hours, or to suppose our\r\nglobe to be animated by a motion of rotation upon itself. For us, the\r\nimpression is the same, and as we are insensible to the motion of the\r\nEarth, its immobility would seem almost natural to us. So that, in last\r\nresort, here as in many other instances, the decision must be made by\r\nsimple common sense. Science long ago made its choice. Moreover, all the\r\nprogress of Astronomy has confirmed the rotary movement of the Earth in\r\ntwenty-four hours, and its movement of revolution round the Sun in a\r\nyear; while at the same time a great number of other motions have been\r\ndiscovered for our wandering planet.\r\n\r\nThe learned philosophers of antiquity divined the double movement of our\r\nplanet. The disciples of Pythagoras taught it more than two thousand\r\nyears ago, and the ancient authors quote among others Nicetas of\r\nSyracuse, and Aristarchus of Samos, as being among the first to promote\r\nthe doctrine of the Earth's movement. But at that remote period no one\r\nhad any idea of the real distances of the stars, and the argument did\r\nnot seem to be based on any adequate evidence. Ptolemy, after a long\r\ndiscussion of the diurnal motion of our planet, refutes it, giving as\r\nhis principal reason that if the Earth turned, the objects that were not\r\nfixed to its surface would appear to move in a contrary direction, and\r\nthat a body shot into the air would fall back to the West of its\r\nstarting-point, the Earth having turned meantime from West to East. This\r\nobjection has no weight, because the Earth controls not only all the\r\nobjects fixed to the soil, but also the atmosphere, and the clouds that\r\nsurround it like a light veil, and all that exists upon its surface. The\r\natmosphere, the clouds, the waters of the ocean, things and beings, all\r\nare adherent to it and make one body with it, participating in its\r\nmovement, as sometimes happens to ourselves in the compartment of a\r\ntrain, or the car of an aerostat. When, for instance, we drop an object\r\nout of such a car, this object, animated with the acquired velocity,\r\ndoes not fall to a point below the aerostat, but follows the balloon, as\r\nthough it were gliding along a thread. The author has made this\r\nexperiment more than once in aerial journeys.\r\n\r\nThus, the hypothesis of the Earth's motion has become a certainty. But\r\nin addition to reasoning, direct proof is not wanting.\r\n\r\n1. The spheroidal shape of the Earth, slightly flattened at the poles\r\nand swollen at the equator, has been produced by the rotary motion, by\r\nthe centrifugal force that it engenders.\r\n\r\n2. In virtue of this centrifugal force, which is at its maximum at the\r\nequator, objects lose a little of their weight in proportion as they are\r\nfarther removed from the polar regions where centrifugal force is almost\r\n_nil_.\r\n\r\n3. In virtue of this same centrifugal force, the length of the pendulum\r\nin seconds is shorter at the equator than in Paris, and the difference\r\nis one of 3 millimeters.\r\n\r\n4. A weight abandoned to itself and falling from a certain height,\r\nshould follow the vertical if the Earth were motionless. Experiment,\r\nfrequently repeated, shows a slight deviation to the East, of the\r\nplumb-line that marks the vertical. We more especially observed this at\r\nthe Pantheon during the recent experiments.\r\n\r\n5. The magnificent experiment of Foucault at the Pantheon, just renewed\r\nunder the auspices of the Astronomical Society of France, demonstrates\r\nthe rotary motion of the Earth to all beholders. A sufficiently heavy\r\nball (28 kilograms, about 60 pounds) is suspended from the dome of the\r\nedifice by an excessively fine steel thread. When the pendulum is in\r\nmotion, a point attached to the bottom of the ball marks its passage\r\nupon two little heaps of sand arranged some yards away from the center.\r\nAt each oscillation this point cuts the sand, and the furrow gets\r\ngradually longer to the right hand of an observer placed at the center\r\nof the pendulum. The plane of the oscillations remains fixed, but the\r\nEarth revolves beneath, from West to East. The fundamental principle of\r\nthis experiment is that the plane in which any pendulum is made to\r\noscillate remains invariable even when the point of suspension is\r\nturned. This demonstration enables us in some measure to see the Earth\r\nturning under our feet.\r\n\r\nThe annual displacements of the stars are again confirmatory of the\r\nEarth's motion round the Sun. During the course of the year, the stars\r\nthat are least remote from our solar province appear to describe minute\r\nellipses, in perspective, in the Heavens. These small apparent\r\nvariations in the position of the nearest stars reproduce the annual\r\nrotation of the Earth round the Sun, in perspective.\r\n\r\nWe could adduce further observations in favor of this double movement,\r\nbut the proofs just given are sufficiently convincing to leave no doubt\r\nin the mind of the reader.\r\n\r\nNor are these two the only motions by which our globe is rocked in\r\nspace. To its diurnal rotation and its annual rotation we may add\r\nanother series of _ten more motions_: some very slow, fulfilling\r\nthemselves in thousands of years, others, more rapid, being constantly\r\nrenewed. It is, however, impossible in these restricted pages to enter\r\ninto the detail reserved for more complete works. We must not forget\r\nthat our present aim is to sum up the essentials of astronomical\r\nknowledge as simply as possible, and to offer our readers only the \"best\r\nof the picking.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two principal motions of which we have just spoken give us the\r\nmeasure of time, the day of twenty-four hours, and the year of 365-1/4\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe Earth turning upon itself in twenty-four hours from West to East,\r\npresents all its parts in succession to the Sun fixed in space.\r\nIlluminated countries have the day, those opposite, in the shadow of the\r\nEarth, are plunged into night. The countries carried by the Earth toward\r\nthe Sun have morning, those borne toward his shadow, evening. Those\r\nwhich receive the rays of the day-star directly have noon; those which\r\nare just opposite have midnight.\r\n\r\nThe rotation of our planet in this way gives us the measure of time; it\r\nhas been divided arbitrarily into twenty-four periods called hours; each\r\nhour into sixty minutes; each minute into sixty seconds.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, each country turns in twenty-four hours round the axis\r\nof the Earth. The difference in hours between the different regions of\r\nthe globe is therefore regulated by the difference of geographical\r\nposition. The countries situated to the West are behind us; the Sun only\r\ngets there after it has shone upon our meridian. When it is midday in\r\nParis, it is only 11.51 A.M. in London; 11.36 A.M. in Madrid; 11.14 A.M.\r\nat Lisbon; 11.12 A.M. at Mogador; 7.06 A.M. at Quebec; 6.55 A.M. at New\r\nYork; 5.14 A.M. in Mexico; and so on. The countries situated to the East\r\nare, on the contrary, ahead of us. When it is noon in Paris, it is\r\nalready 56 minutes after midday at Vienna; 1.25 P.M. at Athens; 2.21\r\nP.M. at Moscow; 3.16 P.M. at Teheran; 4.42 P.M. at Bombay; and so on. We\r\nare here speaking of real times, and not of the conventional times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Motion of the Earth round the Sun.]\r\n\r\nIf we could make the tour of the world in twenty-four hours, starting\r\nat midday from some place to go round the globe, and traveling westward\r\nwith the Sun, we should have him always over our heads. In traveling\r\nround the world from West to East, one goes in front of the Sun, and\r\ngains by one day; in taking the opposite direction, from East to West,\r\none loses a day.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the exact duration of the Earth's diurnal rotation is\r\ntwenty-three hours, fifty-six minutes, four seconds. That is the\r\nsidereal day. But, while turning upon itself, the Earth circulates upon\r\nits orbit, and at the end of a diurnal rotation it is still obliged to\r\nturn during three minutes, fifty-six seconds in order to present exactly\r\nthe same meridian to the fixed Sun which, in consequence of the rotary\r\nperiod of our planet, is a little behind. The solar day is thus one of\r\ntwenty-four hours. There are 366 rotations in the year.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us come back to the consequences of the Earth's motion. In\r\nthe first place our planet does not turn vertically nor on its side, but\r\nis tipped or inclined a certain quantity: 23° 27'.\r\n\r\nNow, throughout its annual journey round the Sun, the inclination\r\nremains the same. That is what produces the seasons and climates. The\r\ncountries which have a larger circle to travel over in the hemisphere of\r\nthe solar illumination have the longer days, those which have a smaller\r\ncircle, shorter days. At the equator there is constantly, and all\r\nthrough the year, a twelve-hour day, and a night of twelve hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Inclination of the Earth.]\r\n\r\nIn summer, the pole dips toward the Sun, and the rays of the orb of day\r\ncover the corresponding hemisphere with their light. Six months later\r\nthis same hemisphere is in winter, and the opposite hemisphere is in its\r\nturn presented to the Sun. June 21 is the summer solstice for the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, and is at the same time winter for the southern\r\npole. Six months later, on December 21, we have winter, while the\r\nsouthern hemisphere is completely exposed to the Sun. Between these two\r\nepochs, when the radiant orb shines exactly upon the equator, that is on\r\nMarch 21, we have the spring equinox, that delicious flowering season\r\nwhen all nature is enchanting and enchanted; on September 21 we have the\r\nautumn equinox, melancholy, but not devoid of charm.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial sphere has been divided into different zones, with which\r\nthe different climates are in relation:\r\n\r\n1. The tropical zone, which extends 23° 27' from one part to the other\r\nof the equator. This is the hottest region. It is limited by the circle\r\nof the tropics.\r\n\r\n2. The temperate zones, which extend from 23° 27' to 66° 23' of\r\nlatitude, and where the Sun sets every day.\r\n\r\n3. The glacial zones, drawn round the poles, at 66° 33' latitude, where\r\nthe Sun remains constantly above or below the horizon for several days,\r\nor even several months. These glacial zones are limited by the polar\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\nWe must add that the _axis_ of the Earth is a straight line that is\r\nsupposed to pass through the center of the globe and come out at two\r\ndiametrically opposite points called the _poles_. The diurnal rotation\r\nof the Earth is effected round this axis.\r\n\r\nThe name _equator_ is given to a great circle situated between the two\r\npoles, at equal distance, which divides the globe into two hemispheres.\r\nThe equator is divided into 360 parts or degrees, by other circles that\r\ngo from one pole to the other. These are the _longitudes_ or meridians\r\n(see Fig. 62). The distance between the equator and the pole is divided\r\ninto larger or smaller circles, which have received the name of\r\n_latitudes_, 90 degrees are reckoned on the one side and the other of\r\nthe equator, in the direction of the North and South poles,\r\nrespectively. The longitudes are reckoned from some point either to East\r\nor West: the latitudes are reckoned North and South, from the equator.\r\nIn going from East to West, or inversely, the longitude changes, but in\r\npassing from North to South of any spot, it is the latitude that alters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--The divisions of the globe. Longitudes and\r\nlatitudes.]\r\n\r\nThe circles of latitude are smaller in proportion as one approaches the\r\npoles. The circumference of the world is 40,076,600 meters at the\r\nequator. At the latitude of Paris (48° 50') it is only 26,431,900\r\nmeters. A point situated at the equator has more ground to travel over\r\nin order to accomplish its rotation in twenty-four hours than a point\r\nnearer the pole.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that this velocity of rotation is 465 meters per\r\nsecond at the equator. At the latitude of Paris it is not more than 305\r\nmeters. At the poles it is _nil_.\r\n\r\nThe longitudes, or meridians, are great circles of equal length,\r\ndividing the Earth into quarters, like the parts of an orange or a\r\nmelon. These circumvent the globe, and measure some 40,000,000\r\n(40,008,032) meters. We may remember in passing that the length of the\r\nmeter has been determined as, by definition, the ten-millionth part of\r\nthe quarter of a celestial meridian.\r\n\r\nThus, while rotating upon itself, the Earth spins round the Sun, along a\r\nvast orbit traced at 149,000,000 kilometers (93,000,000 miles) from the\r\ncentral focus, a sensibly elliptical orbit, as we have already pointed\r\nout. It is a little nearer the Sun on January 1st than on July 1st, at\r\nits perihelion (_peri_, near, _helios_, Sun), than at its aphelion\r\n(_apo_, far, _helios_, Sun). The difference = 6,000,000 kilometers\r\n(3,720,000 miles), and its velocity is a little greater at perihelion\r\nthan at aphelion.\r\n\r\nThis second motion produces the _year_. It is accomplished in three\r\nhundred and sixty-five days, six hours, nine minutes, nine seconds.\r\nSuch is the complete revolution of our planet round the orb of day. It\r\nhas received the name of sidereal year. But this is not how we calculate\r\nthe year in practical life. The civil year, known also as the tropical\r\nyear, is not equivalent to the Earth's revolution, because a very slow\r\ngyratory motion, called \"the precession of the equinoxes,\" the cycle of\r\nwhich occupies 25,765 years, drags the spring equinox back some twenty\r\nminutes in each year.\r\n\r\nThe civil year is, accordingly, three hundred and sixty-five days, five\r\nhours, forty-eight minutes, forty-six seconds.\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify the calendar, this accumulating fraction of five\r\nhours, forty-eight minutes, forty-six seconds (about a quarter day) is\r\nadded every four years to a bissextile year (leap-year), and thus we\r\nhave uneven years of three hundred and sixty-five, and three hundred and\r\nsixty-six days. Every year of which the figure is divisible by four is a\r\nleap-year. By adding a quarter day to each year, there is a surplus of\r\neleven minutes, fourteen seconds. These are subtracted every hundred\r\nyears by not taking as bissextile those secular years of which the\r\nradical is not divisible by four. The year 1600 was leap-year: 1700,\r\n1800, and 1900 were not; 2000 will be. The agreement between the\r\ncalendar and nature has thus been fairly perfect, since the\r\nestablishment of the Gregorian Calendar in 1582.\r\n\r\nSince the terrestrial orbit measures not less than 930,000,000\r\nkilometers (576,600,000 miles), which must be traversed in a year, the\r\nEarth flies through Space at 2,544,000 kilometers (1,577,280 miles) a\r\nday, or 106,000 kilometers (65,720 miles) an hour, or 29,500 meters (18\r\nmiles) per second on an average, a little faster at perihelion, a little\r\nslower at aphelion. This giddy course, a thousand times more rapid than\r\nthe speed of an express-train, is effected without commotion, shock, or\r\nnoise. Reasoning alone enables us to divine the prodigious movement that\r\ncarries us along in the vast fields of the Infinite, in mid-heaven.\r\n\r\nReturning to the calendar, it must be remarked in conclusion, that the\r\nhuman race has not exhibited great sense in fixing the New Year on\r\nJanuary 1. No more disagreeable season could have been selected. And\r\nfurther, as the ancient Roman names of the months have been preserved,\r\nwhich in the time of Romulus began with March, the \"seventh\" month,\r\n\"September,\" is our ninth month; October (the eighth) is the tenth;\r\nNovember (the ninth) has become the eleventh; and December (the tenth)\r\nhas taken the place of the twelfth. Verily, we are not hard to please!\r\n\r\nThese months, again, are unequal, as every one knows. Witness the\r\nsimple expedient of remembering the long and short months, by closing\r\nthe left hand and counting the knobs and hollows of the fist, the former\r\ncorresponding to the long months, the latter to the short: first knob =\r\nJanuary; first hollow, February; second knob, March; and so on.[12]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--To find the long and short months.]\r\n\r\nShould not the real renewal of the year coincide with the awakening of\r\nNature, with the spring on the terrestrial hemisphere occupied by the\r\ngreater portion of Humanity, with the date of March 21st? Should not the\r\nmonths be equalized, and their names modified? Why should we not follow\r\nthe beautiful evolution dictated by the Sun and by the movement of our\r\nplanet? But our poor Earth may roll on a long time yet before its\r\ninhabitants will become reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the delightful hour when all Nature pauses in the tranquil calm of\r\nthe silent night.\r\n\r\nThe Sun has cast his farewell gleams upon the weary Earth. All sound is\r\nhushed. And soon the stars will shine out one by one in the bosom of the\r\nsomber firmament. Opposite to the sunset, in the east, the Full Moon\r\nrises slowly, as it were calling our thoughts toward the mysteries of\r\neternity, while her limpid night spreads over space like a dew from\r\nHeaven.\r\n\r\nIn the odorous woods, the trees are silhouetted strangely upon the sky,\r\nseeming to stretch their knotted arms toward this celestial beauty. On\r\nthe river, smooth as a mirror, wherein the pale Phoebe reflects her\r\nsplendor, the maidens go to seek the floating image of their future\r\nspouse. And in response to their prayers, she rends the veil of cloud\r\nthat hides her from their eyes, and pours the reflection of her gentle\r\nbeams upon the sleeping waters.\r\n\r\nFrom all time the Moon has had the privilege of charming the gaze, and\r\nattracting the particular attention of mortals. What thoughts have not\r\nbeen wafted to her pale, yet luminous disk? Orb of mystery and of\r\nsolitude, brooding over our silent nights, this celestial luminary is at\r\nonce sad and splendid in her glacial purity, and her limpid rays provoke\r\na reverie full of charm and melancholy. Mute witness of terrestrial\r\ndestinies, her nocturnal flame watches over our planet, following it in\r\nits course as a faithful satellite.\r\n\r\nThe human eye first uplifted to the Heavens was struck, above all, with\r\nthe brilliancy of this solitary globe, straying among the stars. The\r\nMoon first suggested an easy division of time into months and weeks, and\r\nthe first astronomical observations were limited to the study of her\r\nphases.\r\n\r\nDaughter of the Earth, the Moon was born at the limits of the\r\nterrestrial nebula, when our world was still no more than a vast gaseous\r\nsphere, and was detached from her at some critical period of colossal\r\nsolar tide. Separating with regret from her cradle, but attached to the\r\nEarth by indissoluble ties of attraction, she rotates round us in a\r\nmonth, from west to east, and this movement keeps her back a little each\r\nday in relation to the stars. If we watch, evening by evening, beginning\r\nfrom the new moon, we shall observe that she is each night a little\r\nfarther to the left, or east, than on the preceding evening. This\r\nrevolution of the Moon around our planet produces the phases, and gives\r\nthe measure of our months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--The Full Moon slowly rises.]\r\n\r\nDuring her monthly journey she always presents the same face to us. One\r\nmight think that the fear of losing us had immobilized her globe, and\r\nprevented her from turning. And so we only know of her the vague sketch\r\nof a human face that has been observed through all the ages.\r\n\r\nIt seems, in fact, as though she were looking down upon us from the\r\nHeavens, the more so as the principal spots of her disk vaguely recall\r\nthe aspect of a face. If we try to draw it without the aid of\r\ninstruments we observe dark regions and clear regions that each\r\ninterprets in his own fashion. To the author, for instance, the full\r\nMoon has the appearance represented in the following figure. The spots\r\nresemble two eyes and the sketch of a nose; resulting in a vague human\r\nfigure, as indicated on the lower disk. Others see a man carrying a\r\nbundle of wood, a hare, a lion, a dog, a kangaroo, a sickle, two heads\r\nembracing, etc.[13] But generally speaking, there is a tendency to see a\r\nhuman figure in it.\r\n\r\nIf this appearance is helped a little by drawing, it gives the profile\r\nof a man's head fairly well sketched, and furnished with an abundant\r\ncrop of hair (Fig. 66). Others go much more into detail, and draw a\r\nwoman's head that is certainly too definite, like this of M. Jean Sardou\r\n(Fig. 67). Others, again, like M. Zamboni, see behind the man's profile\r\nthe likeness of a young girl being embraced by him (Fig. 68). There is\r\ncertainly some imagination about these. And yet, on the first suitable\r\noccasion, look at the Moon through an opera-glass, a few days after the\r\nfirst quarter, and you will not fail to see the masculine profile just\r\ndescribed, and even to imagine the \"kiss in the Moon.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--The Moon viewed with the unaided eye.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--The Man's head in the Moon.]\r\n\r\nThese vague aspects disappear as soon as the Moon is examined with even\r\nthe least powerful instruments: the spots are better defined, and the\r\nillusions of indistinct vision vanish. Compare this direct photograph of\r\nthe Moon, taken by the author some years ago (Fig. 69): here is neither\r\na human figure, man, dog, hare, nor faggot; simply deep geographical\r\nconfigurations, and in the lower region, a luminous point whence certain\r\nlight bands spread out, some being prolonged to a considerable distance.\r\nAnd yet, from a little way off, does it not form the man's face above\r\nindicated?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Woman's head in the Moon.]\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest astronomical observations made with the aid of\r\ninstruments by Galileo, in 1609, people tried to find out what the dark\r\nspots could represent, and they were called seas, because water absorbs\r\nlight, and reflects it less than _terra firma_. The Moon of itself\r\npossesses no intrinsic light, any more than our planet, and only shines\r\nby the light of the Sun that illuminates it. As it rotates round the\r\nEarth, and constantly changes its position with respect to the Sun, we\r\nsee more or less of its illuminated hemisphere, and the result is the\r\nphases that every one knows so well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--The kiss in the Moon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--Photograph of the Moon.]\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of each lunation, the Moon is between the Sun and\r\nthe Earth, and its non-illuminated hemisphere is turned toward us. This\r\nis the New Moon, invisible to us; but two days later, the slim crescent\r\nof Diana sheds a gentle radiance upon the Earth. Gradually the crescent\r\nenlarges. When the Moon arrives at right angles with ourselves and with\r\nthe Sun, half the illuminated hemisphere is presented to us. This is the\r\nfirst quarter. At the time of Full Moon, it is opposite the Sun, and we\r\nsee the whole of the hemisphere illuminated. Then comes the decline: the\r\nbrilliant disk is slightly corroded at first; it diminishes from day to\r\nday, and about a week before the New Moon our fair friend only shows her\r\nprofile before she once more passes in front of the Sun: this is the\r\nlast quarter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--The Moon's Phases.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Moon is crescent, in the first evenings of the lunation, and\r\nafter the last quarter, the rest of the disk is visible, illuminated\r\nfeebly by a pale luminosity. This is known as the ashy light. It is due\r\nto the shine of the Earth, reflecting the light received from the Sun\r\ninto space. Accordingly the ashy light is the reflection of our own sent\r\nback to us by the Moon. It is the reflection of a reflection.\r\n\r\nThis rotation of the Moon round the Earth is accomplished in\r\ntwenty-seven days, seven hours, forty-three minutes, eleven seconds; but\r\nas the Earth is simultaneously revolving round the Sun, when the Moon\r\nreturns to the same point (the Earth having become displaced relatively\r\nto the Sun), the Moon has to travel two days longer to recover its\r\nposition between the Sun and the Earth, so that the lunar month is\r\nlonger than the sidereal revolution of the Moon, and takes twenty-nine\r\ndays, twelve hours, forty-four minutes, three seconds. This is the\r\nduration of the sequence of phases.\r\n\r\nThis revolution is accomplished at a distance of 384,000 kilometers\r\n(238,000 miles). The velocity of the Moon in its orbit is more than 1\r\nkilometer (0.6214 mile) per second. But our planet sweeps it through\r\nspace at a velocity almost thirty times greater.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the Moon represents 273/1000 that of the Earth, _i.e._,\r\n3,480 kilometers (2,157 miles).\r\n\r\nIts surface = 38,000,000 square kilometers (15,000,000 square miles), a\r\nlittle more than the thirteenth part of the terrestrial surface, which\r\n= 510,000,000 (200,000,000 square miles).\r\n\r\nIn volume, the Moon is fifty times less than the Earth. Its mass or\r\nweight is only 1/81 that of the terrestrial globe. Its density = 0.615,\r\nrelatively to that of the Earth, _i.e._, a little more than three times\r\nthat of water. Weight at its surface is very little: 0.174. A kilogram\r\ntransported thither would only weigh 174 grams.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the meager distance of 384,000 kilometers (238,000 miles) that\r\nseparates us from it (about thirty times the diameter of the Earth), the\r\nMoon is a suburb of our terrestrial habitation. What does this small\r\ndistance amount to? It is a mere step in the universe.\r\n\r\nA telegraphic message would get there in one and a half second; a\r\nprojectile fired from a gun would arrive in eight days, five hours; an\r\nexpress-train would be due in eight months, twenty-two days. It is only\r\nthe 1/388 part of the distance that separates us from the Sun, and only\r\nthe 100/1,000,000 part of the distance of the stars nearest to us. Many\r\nmen have tramped the distance that separates us from the Moon. A bridge\r\nof thirty terrestrial globes would suffice to unite the two worlds.\r\n\r\nOwing to this great proximity, the Moon is the best known of all the\r\ncelestial spheres. Its geographical (or more correctly,\r\nselenographical, _Selene_, moon) map was drawn out more than two\r\ncenturies ago, at first in a vague sketch, and afterward with more\r\ndetails, until to-day it is as precise and accurate as any of our\r\nterrestrial maps of geography.\r\n\r\nBefore the invention of the telescope, from antiquity to the seventeenth\r\ncentury, people lost themselves in conjectures as to the nature of this\r\nstrange lunar figure. It was held to be a mysterious world, the more\r\nextraordinary in that it always presented the same face to us. Some\r\ncompared it to an immense mirror reflecting the image of the Earth.\r\nOthers pictured it as a silver star, an enchanted abode where all was\r\nwealth and happiness. For many a long day it was the fashion to think,\r\nquite irrationally, that the inhabitants of the Moon were fifteen times\r\nbigger than ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe invention of telescopes, however, brought a little order and a grain\r\nof truth into these fantastic assumptions. The first observations of\r\nGalileo revolutionized science, and his discoveries filled the\r\nbest-ordered minds with enthusiasm. Thenceforward, the Moon became our\r\nproperty, a terrestrial suburb, where the whole world would gladly have\r\ninstalled itself, had the means of getting there been as swift as the\r\nwings of the imagination. It became easy enough to invent a thousand\r\nenchanting descriptions of the charms of our fair sister, and no one\r\nscrupled to do so. Soon, it was observed that the Moon closely resembled\r\nthe Earth in its geological features; its surface bristles with sharp\r\nmountain peaks that light up in so many luminous points beneath the rays\r\nof the Sun. Alongside, dark and shaded parts indicate the plains;\r\nmoreover, there are large gray patches that were supposed to be seas\r\nbecause they reflect the solar light less perfectly than the adjacent\r\ncountries. At that epoch hardly anything was known of the physical\r\nconstitution of the Moon, and it was figured as enveloped with an\r\natmospheric layer, analogous to that at the bottom of which we carry on\r\nour respiration.\r\n\r\nTo-day we know that these \"seas\" are destitute of water, and that if the\r\nlunar globe possesses an atmosphere, it must be excessively light.\r\n\r\nThe Moon became the favorite object of astronomers, and the numerous\r\nobservations made of it authorized the delineation of very interesting\r\nselenographic charts. In order to find one's way among the seas, plains,\r\nand mountains that make up the lunar territory, it was necessary to name\r\nthem. The seas were the first to be baptized, in accordance with their\r\nreputed astrological influences. Accordingly, we find on the Moon, the\r\nSea of Fecundity, the Lake of Death, the Sea of Humors, the Ocean of\r\nTempests, the Sea of Tranquillity, the Marsh of Mists, the Lake of\r\nDreams, the Sea of Putrefaction, the Peninsula of Reverie, the Sea of\r\nRains, etc.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the luminous parts and the mountains, it was at first\r\nproposed to call them after the most illustrious astronomers, but the\r\nfear of giving offense acted as a check on Hevelius and Riccioli,\r\nauthors of the first lunar maps (1647, 1651), and they judged it more\r\nprudent to transfer the names of the terrestrial mountains to the Moon.\r\nThe Alps, the Apennines, the Pyrenees, the Carpathians, are all to be\r\nfound up there; then, as the vocabulary of the mountains was not\r\nadequate, the scientists reasserted their rights, and we meet in the\r\nMoon, Aristotle, Plato, Hipparchus, Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, Newton,\r\nas well as other more modern and even contemporaneous celebrities.\r\n\r\nWe have not space to reproduce the general chart of the Moon (that\r\npublished by the author measures not less than a meter, with the\r\nnomenclature); but the figure subjoined gives a summary sufficient for\r\nthe limits of this little book. Here are the names of the principal\r\nlunar mountains, with the numbers corresponding to them upon the map.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--Map of the Moon.\r\n\r\n(From Fowler's \"Telescopic Astronomy.\")\r\n\r\n           1 Furnerius\r\n           2 Petavius\r\n           3 Langrenus\r\n           4 Macrobius\r\n           5 Cleomedes\r\n           6 Endymion\r\n           7 Altas\r\n           8 Hercules\r\n           9 Romer\r\n          10 Posidonius\r\n          11 Fracastorius\r\n          12 Theophilus\r\n          13 Piccolomini\r\n          14 Albategnius\r\n          15 Hipparchus\r\n          16 Manilius\r\n          17 Eudoxus\r\n          18 Aristotle\r\n          19 Cassini\r\n          20 Aristillus\r\n          21 Plato\r\n          22 Archimedes\r\n          23 Eratosthenes\r\n          24 Copernicus\r\n          25 Ptolemy\r\n          26 Alphonsus\r\n          27 Arzachel\r\n          28 Walter\r\n          29 Clavius\r\n          30 Tycho\r\n          31 Bullialdus\r\n          32 Schiller\r\n          33 Schickard\r\n          34 Gassendi\r\n          35 Kepler\r\n          36 Grimaldi\r\n          37 Aristarchus\r\n\r\n          A Mare Crisum\r\n          B Mare Fercunditatis\r\n          C Mare Nectaris\r\n          D Mare Tranquilitatis\r\n          E Mare Serenitatis\r\n          F Mare Imbrium\r\n          G Sinus Iridum\r\n          H Oceanus Procellarum\r\n          I Mare Humorum\r\n          K Mare Nubium\r\n          V Altai Mountains\r\n          W Mare Vaporum\r\n          X Apennine Mountains\r\n          Y Caucasus Mountains\r\n          Z Alps]\r\n\r\nThe constantly growing progress of optics leads to perpetual new\r\ndiscoveries in science, and at the present time we can say that we know\r\nthe geography of the Moon as well as, and even better than, that of our\r\nown planet. The heights of all the mountains of the Moon are measured to\r\nwithin a few feet. (One cannot say as much for the mountains of the\r\nEarth.) The highest are over 7,000 meters (nearly 25,000 feet).\r\nRelatively to its proportions, the satellite is much more mountainous\r\nthan the planet, and the plutonian giants are much more numerous there\r\nthan here. If we have peaks, like the Gaorisankar, the highest of the\r\nHimalayas and of the whole Earth, whose elevation of 8,840 meters\r\n(29,000 feet) is equivalent to 1/1140 the diameter of our globe, there\r\nare peaks on the Moon of 7,700 meters (25,264 feet), _e.g._, those of\r\nDoerfel and Leibniz, the height of which is equivalent to 1/470 the\r\nlunar diameter.\r\n\r\nTycho's Mountain is one of the finest upon our satellite. It is visible\r\nwith the naked eye (and perfectly with opera-glasses) as a white point\r\nshining like a kind of star upon the lower portion of the disk. At the\r\ntime of full moon it is dazzling, and projects long rays from afar upon\r\nthe lunar globe. So, too, Mount Copernicus, whose brilliant whiteness\r\nsparkles in space. But the strangest thing about these lunar mountains\r\nis that they are all hollow, and can be measured as well in depth as in\r\nheight. A type of mountain as strange to us as are the seas without\r\nwater! In effect, these mountains of the moon are ancient volcanic\r\ncraters, with no summits, nor covers.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the highest peaks, there is a large circular depression,\r\nprolonged into the heart of the mountain, sometimes far below the level\r\nof the surrounding plains, and as these craters often measure several\r\nhundred kilometers, one is obliged, if one does not want to go all round\r\nthem in crossing the mountain, to descend almost perpendicularly into\r\nthe depths and cross there, to reascend the opposite side, and return to\r\nthe plain. These alpine excursions incontestably deserve the name of\r\nperilous ascents!\r\n\r\nNo country on the Earth can give us any notion of the state of the lunar\r\nsoil: never was ground so tormented; never globe so profoundly shattered\r\nto its very bowels. The mountains are accumulations of enormous rocks\r\ntumbled one upon the other, and round the awful labyrinth of craters one\r\nsees nothing but dismantled ramparts, or columns of pointed rocks like\r\ncathedral spires issuing from the chaos.\r\n\r\nAs we said, there is no atmosphere, or at least so little at the bottom\r\nof the valleys that it is imperceptible. No clouds, no fog, no rain nor\r\nsnow. The sky is an eternally black space, vaultless, jeweled with stars\r\nby day as by night.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that we arrive among these savage steppes at daybreak:\r\nthe lunar day is fifteen times longer than our own, because the Sun\r\ntakes a month to illuminate the entire circuit of the Moon; there are no\r\nless than 354 hours from the rising to the setting of the Sun. If we\r\narrive before the sunrise, there is no aurora to herald it, for in the\r\nabsence of atmosphere there can be no sort of twilight. Of a sudden on\r\nthe dark horizon come flashes of the solar light, striking the summits\r\nof the mountains, while the plains and valleys are still in darkness.\r\nThe light spreads slowly, for while on the Earth in central latitudes\r\nthe Sun takes only two minutes and a quarter to rise, on the Moon it\r\ntakes nearly an hour, and in consequence the light it sends out is very\r\nweak for some minutes, and increases excessively slowly. It is a kind of\r\naurora, but lasts a very short time, for when at the end of half an\r\nhour, the solar disk has half risen, the light appears as intense to the\r\neye as when it is entirely above the horizon; the radiant orb is seen\r\nwith its protuberances and its burning atmosphere. It rises slowly, like\r\na luminous god, in the depths of the black sky, a profound and formless\r\nsky in which the stars shine all day, since they are not hidden by any\r\natmospheric veil such as conceals them from us during the daylight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--The Lunar Apennines.]\r\n\r\nThe absence of sensible atmosphere must produce an effect on the\r\ntemperature of the Moon analogous to that perceived on the high\r\nmountains of our globe, where the rarefaction of the air does not permit\r\nthe solar heat to concentrate itself upon the surface of the soil, as it\r\ndoes below the atmosphere, which acts as a forcing-house: the Sun's heat\r\nis not kept in by anything, and incessantly radiates out toward space.\r\nIn all probability the cold is extremely and constantly rigorous, not\r\nonly during the nights, which are fifteen times longer than our own, but\r\neven during the long days of sunshine.\r\n\r\nWe give two different drawings to represent these curious aspects of\r\nlunar topography. The first (Fig. 72) is taken in the neighborhood of\r\nthe Apennines, and shows a long chain of mountains beneath which are\r\nthree deep rings, Archimedes, Aristillus, and Autolycus: the second\r\n(Fig. 73) depicts the lunar ring of Flammarion,[14] whose outline is\r\nconstructed of dismantled ramparts, and whose depths are sprinkled with\r\nlittle craters. The first of these two drawings was made in England by\r\nNasmyth, the second in Germany by Krieger: they both give an exact idea\r\nof what one sees in the telescope with different modes of solar\r\nillumination.\r\n\r\nIn the Moon's always black and starry sky a majestic star that is not\r\nvisible from the Earth, and exhibits this peculiarity that it is\r\nstationary in the Heavens, while all the others pass behind it, may\r\nconstantly be admired, by day as well as by night; and it is also of\r\nconsiderable apparent magnitude. This orb, some four times as large as\r\nthe Moon in diameter, and thirteen to fourteen times more extensive in\r\nsurface, is our Earth, which presents to the Moon a sequence of phases\r\nsimilar to those which our satellite presents to us, but in the inverse\r\ndirection. At the moment of New Moon, the Sun fully illuminates the\r\nterrestrial hemisphere turned toward our satellite, and we get \"Full\r\nEarth\"; at the time of Full Moon, on the contrary, the non-illuminated\r\nhemisphere of the Earth is turned toward the satellite, and we get \"New\r\nEarth\": when the Moon shows us first quarter, the Earth is in last\r\nquarter, and so on. The drawing subjoined gives an idea of these\r\naspects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Flammarion's Lunar Ring.]\r\n\r\nWhat a curious sight our globe must be during this long night of\r\nfourteen times twenty-four hours! Independent of its phases, which bring\r\nit from first quarter to full earth for the middle of the night, and\r\nfrom full earth to last quarter for sunrise, how interested we should be\r\nto see it thus stationary in the sky, and turning on itself in\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--Lunar landscape with the Earth in the sky.]\r\n\r\nYes, thanks to us, the inhabitants of the lunar hemisphere turned toward\r\nus are gratified by the sight of a splendid nocturnal torch, doubtless\r\nless white than our own despite the clouds with which the terrestrial\r\nglobe is studded, and shaded in a tender tone of bluish emerald-green.\r\nThe royal orb of their long nights, the Earth, gives them moonlight of\r\nunparalleled beauty, and we may say without false modesty that our\r\npresence in the lunar sky must produce marvelous and absolutely\r\nfairy-like effects.\r\n\r\nMaybe, they envy us our globe, a dazzling dwelling-place whose splendor\r\nradiates through space; they see its greenish clarity varying with the\r\nextent of cloud that veils its seas and continents, and they observe its\r\nmotion of rotation, by which all the countries of our planet are\r\nrevealed in succession to its admirers.\r\n\r\nWe are talking of these pageants seen from the Moon, and of the\r\ninhabitants of our satellite as if they really existed. The sterile and\r\ndesolate aspect of the lunar world, however, rather brings us to the\r\nconclusion that such inhabitants are non-existent, although we have no\r\nauthorization for affirming this. That they have existed seems to me\r\nbeyond doubt. The lunar volcanoes had a considerable activity, in an\r\natmosphere that allowed the white volcanic ashes to be carried a long\r\nway by the winds, figuring round the craters the stellar rays that are\r\nstill so striking. These cinders were spread over the soil, preserving\r\nall its asperities of outline, a little heaped up on the side to which\r\nthey were impelled. The magnificent photographs recently made at the\r\nParis Observatory by MM. Loewy and Puiseux are splendid evidence of\r\nthese projections. In this era of planetary activity there were liquids\r\nand gases on the surface of the lunar globe, which appear subsequently\r\nto have been entirely absorbed. Now the teaching of our own planet is\r\nthat Nature nowhere remains infertile, and that the production of Life\r\nis a law so general and so imperious that life develops at its own\r\nexpense, sooner than abstain from developing. Accordingly, it is\r\ndifficult to suppose that the lunar elements can have remained inactive,\r\nwhen only next door they exhibited such fecundity upon our globe. Yes,\r\nthe Moon has been inhabited by beings doubtless very different from\r\nourselves, and perhaps may still be, although this globe has run through\r\nthe phases of its astral life more rapidly than our own, and the\r\ndaughter is relatively older than the mother.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the life of the worlds appears to have been in\r\nproportion with their masses. The Moon cooled and mineralized more\r\nquickly than the Earth. Jupiter is still fluid.\r\n\r\nThe progress of optics brings us already very close to this neighboring\r\nprovince. 'Tis a pity we can not get a little nearer!\r\n\r\nA telescopic magnification of 2,000 puts the Moon at 384,000/2000 or 192\r\nkilometers (some 120 miles) from our eye. Practically we can obtain no\r\nmore, either from the most powerful instruments, or from photographic\r\nenlargements. Sometimes, exceptionally, enlargements of 3,000 can be\r\nused. This = 384000/3000 or 128 kilometers (some 80 miles). Undoubtedly,\r\nthis is an admirable result, which does the greatest honor to human\r\nintelligence. But it is still too far to enable us to determine anything\r\nin regard to lunar life.\r\n\r\nAny one who likes to be impressed by grand and magnificent sights may\r\nturn even a modest field-glass upon our luminous satellite, at about\r\nfirst quarter, when the relief of its surface, illuminated obliquely by\r\nthe Sun, is at its greatest value. If you examine our neighbor world at\r\nthis period, for choice at the hour of sunset, you will be astonished at\r\nits brilliancy and beauty. Its outlines, its laces, and embroideries,\r\ngive the image of a jewel of shining silver, translucent, fluid,\r\npalpitating in the ether. Nothing could be more beautiful, nothing\r\npurer, and more celestial, than this lunar globe floating in the silence\r\nof space, and sending back to us as in some fairy dream the solar\r\nillumination that floods it. But yesterday I received the same\r\nimpression, watching a great ring half standing out, and following the\r\nprogress of the Sun as it mounted the lunar horizon to touch these\r\nsilvered peaks. And I reflected that it is indeed inconceivable that\r\n999,999/1,000,000 of the inhabitants of our planet should pass their\r\nlives without ever having attended to this pageant, nor to any of those\r\nothers which the divine Urania scatters so profusely beneath the\r\nwondering gaze of the observers of the Heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE ECLIPSES\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong all the celestial phenomena at which it may be our lot to assist\r\nduring our contemplation of the universe, one of the most magnificent\r\nand imposing is undoubtedly that which we are now going to consider.\r\n\r\nThe hirsute comets, and shooting stars with their graceful flight,\r\ncaptivate us with a mysterious and sometimes fantastic attraction. We\r\ngladly allow our thoughts, mute questioners of the mysteries of the\r\nfirmament, to rest upon the brilliant, golden trail they leave behind\r\nthem. These unknown travelers bring a message from eternity; they tell\r\nus the tale of their distant journeys. Children of space, their ethereal\r\nbeauty speaks of the immensity of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe eclipses, on the other hand, are phenomena that touch us more\r\nnearly, and take place in our vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn treating of them, we remain between the Earth and the Moon, in our\r\nlittle province, and witness the picturesque effects of the combined\r\nmovements of our satellite around us.\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen a total eclipse of the Sun?\r\n\r\nThe sky is absolutely clear: no fraction of cloud shadows the solar\r\nrays. The azure vault of the firmament crowns the Earth with a dome of\r\ndazzling light. The fires of the orb of day shed their beneficent\r\ninfluence generally upon the world.\r\n\r\nYet, see! The radiance diminishes. The luminous disk of the Sun is\r\ngradually corroded. Another disk, as black as ink, creeps in front of\r\nit, and little by little invades it entirely. The atmosphere takes on a\r\nwan, sepulchral hue; astonished nature is hushed in profound silence; an\r\nimmense veil of sadness spreads over the world. Night comes on suddenly,\r\nand the stars shine out in the Heavens. It seems as though by some\r\nmysterious cataclysm the Sun had disappeared forever. But this\r\ntribulation is soon over. The divine orb is not extinct. A flaming jet\r\nemerges from the shadow, announcing his return, and when he reappears we\r\nsee that he has lost nothing in splendor or beauty. He is still the\r\nradiant Apollo, King of Day, watching over the life of the planetary\r\nworlds.\r\n\r\nThis sudden night, darkening the Heavens in the midst of a fine day, can\r\nnot fail to produce a vivid impression upon the spectators of the superb\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse lasts only for a few moments, but long enough to make a deep\r\nimpression upon our minds, and indeed to inspire anxious spirits with\r\nterror and agitation--even at this epoch, when we know that there is\r\nnothing supernatural or formidable about it.\r\n\r\nIn former days, Humanity would have trembled, in uneasy consternation.\r\nWas it a judgment from Heaven? Must it not be the work of some invisible\r\nhand throwing the somber veil of night over the celestial torch?\r\n\r\nHad not the Earth strayed off her appointed path, and were we not all to\r\nbe deprived eternally of the light of our good Sun? Was some monstrous\r\ndragon perhaps preparing to devour the orb of day?\r\n\r\nThe fable of the dragon devouring the Sun or Moon during the eclipses is\r\nuniversal in Asia as in Africa, and still finds acceptance under more\r\nthan one latitude. But our readers already know that we may identify the\r\nterrible celestial dragon with our gentle friend the Moon, who would not\r\nbe greatly flattered by the comparison.\r\n\r\nWe saw in the preceding lesson that the Moon revolves round us,\r\ndescribing an almost circular orbit that she travels over in about a\r\nmonth. In consequence of this motion, the nocturnal orb is sometimes\r\nbetween the Sun and the Earth, sometimes behind us, sometimes at a right\r\nangle in relation to the Sun and the Earth. Now, the eclipses of the Sun\r\noccur invariably at the time of New Moon, when our satellite passes\r\nbetween the Sun and ourselves, and the eclipses of the Moon, at the\r\nmoment of Full Moon, when the latter is opposite to the Sun, and behind\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThis fact soon enabled the astronomers of antiquity to discover the\r\ncauses to which eclipses are due.\r\n\r\nThe Moon, passing at the beginning of its revolution between the Sun and\r\nthe Earth, may conceal a greater or lesser portion of the orb of day. In\r\nthis case there is an eclipse of the Sun. On the other hand, when it is\r\non the other side of the Earth in relation to the Sun, at the moment of\r\nFull Moon, our planet may intercept the solar rays, and prevent them\r\nfrom reaching our satellite. The Moon is plunged into _the shadow of the\r\nEarth_, and is then eclipsed. Such is the very simple explanation of the\r\nphenomenon. But why is there not an eclipse of the Sun at each New Moon,\r\nand an eclipse of the Moon at each Full Moon?\r\n\r\nIf the Moon revolved round us in the same plane as the Earth round the\r\nSun, it would eclipse the Sun at each New Moon, and would be itself\r\neclipsed in our shadow at each Full Moon. But the plane of the lunar\r\norbit dips a little upon the plane of the terrestrial orbit, and the\r\neclipses can only be produced when the New Moon or the Full Moon occur\r\nat the line of intersection of these two planes, _i.e._, when the Sun,\r\nthe Moon, and the Earth are upon the same straight line. In the majority\r\nof cases, instead of interposing itself directly in front of the\r\nsovereign of our system, our satellite passes a little above or a little\r\nbelow him, just as its passage behind us is nearly always effected a\r\nlittle above or below the cone of shadow that accompanies our planet,\r\nopposite the Sun.\r\n\r\nWhen the Moon intervenes directly in front of the Sun, she arrests the\r\nlight of the radiant orb, and conceals a greater or less portion of the\r\nsolar disk. The eclipse is partial if the Moon covers only a portion of\r\nthe Sun; total if she covers it entirely; annular, if the solar disk is\r\nvisible all round the lunar disk, as appears when the Moon, in her\r\nelliptical orbit, is beyond medium distance, toward the apogee.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when the Moon arrives immediately within the cone of\r\nshadow that the Earth projects behind it, it is her turn to be eclipsed.\r\nShe no longer receives the rays of the Sun, and this deprivation is the\r\nmore marked in that she owes all her brilliancy to the light of the orb\r\nof day. The Moon's obscurity is complete if she is entirely plunged into\r\nthe cone of shadow. In this case, the eclipse is total. But if a portion\r\nof her disk emerges from the cone, that part remains illuminated while\r\nthe light of the other dies out. In that case there is a partial\r\neclipse, and the rounded form of the Earth's shadow can be seen\r\nprojected upon our satellite, a celestial witness to the spherical\r\nnature of our globe.\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions, then, the Moon can deprive us of the luminous\r\nrays of the Sun, by concealing the orb of day, and in other cases is\r\nherself effaced in crossing our shadow. Despite the fables, fears, and\r\nanxieties it has engendered, this phenomenon is perfectly natural: the\r\nMoon is only playing hide-and-seek with us--a very harmless amusement,\r\nas regards the safety of our planet.\r\n\r\nBut as we said just now, these phenomena formerly had the power of\r\nterrifying ignorant mortals, either when the orb of light and life\r\nseemed on the verge of extinction, or when the beautiful Phoebus was\r\ncovered with a veil of crape and woe, or took on a deep coppery hue.\r\n\r\nIt would take a volume to describe all the notable events which have\r\nbeen influenced by eclipses, sometimes for good, more often with\r\ndisastrous consequences. The recital of these tragic stories would not\r\nbe devoid of interest; it would illustrate the possibilities of\r\nignorance and superstition, and the power man gains from intellectual\r\nculture and scientific study.\r\n\r\nHerodotus records that the Scythians, having some grievance against\r\nCyaxarus, King of the Medes, revenged themselves by serving up the limbs\r\nof one of his children, whom they had murdered, at a banquet as rare\r\ngame. The scoundrels who committed this atrocious crime took refuge at\r\nthe Court of the King of Lydia, who was ill judged enough to protect\r\nthem. War was accordingly declared between the Medes and Lydians, but a\r\ntotal eclipse of the Sun occurring just when the battle was imminent,\r\nhad the happy effect of disarming the combatants, who prudently retired\r\neach to their own country. This eclipse, which seems to have occurred on\r\nMay 28, 584 B.C., had been predicted by Thales. The French painter\r\nRochegrosse has painted a striking picture of the scene (Fig. 75).\r\n\r\nIn the year 413 B.C. the Athenian General Nicias prepared to return to\r\nGreece after an expedition to Sicily. But, terrified by an eclipse of\r\nthe Moon, and fearing the malign influence of the phenomenon, he put off\r\nhis departure, and lost the chance of retreat. This superstition cost\r\nhim his life. The Greek army was destroyed, and this event marks the\r\ncommencement of the decadence of Athens.\r\n\r\nIn 331 B.C. an eclipse of the Moon disorganized the troops of Alexander,\r\nnear Arbela, and the great Macedonian Captain had need of all his\r\naddress to reassure his panic-stricken soldiers.\r\n\r\nAgathocles, King of Syracuse, blocked by the Carthaginians in the port\r\nof this city, had the good fortune to escape, but was disturbed on the\r\nsecond day of his flight by the arrival of a total eclipse of the Sun\r\nwhich alarmed his companions. \"What are you afraid of?\" said he,\r\nspreading his cloak in front of the Sun. \"Are you alarmed at a shadow?\"\r\n(This eclipse seems to be that of August 15, 309, rather than that of\r\nMarch 2, 310.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Battle between the Medes and Lydians arrested\r\nby an Eclipse of the Sun.]\r\n\r\nOn June 29, 1033, an epoch at which the approaching end of the world\r\nstruck terror into all hearts, an annular eclipse of the Sun occurring\r\nabout midday frustrated the designs of a band of conspirators who\r\nintended to strangle the Pope at the altar. This Pope was Benedict IX, a\r\nyouth of less than twenty, whose conduct is said to have been anything\r\nbut exemplary. The assassins, terrified at the darkening of the Sun,\r\ndared not touch the Pontiff, and he reigned till 1044.[15]\r\n\r\nOn March 1, 1504, a lunar eclipse saved the life of Christopher\r\nColumbus. He was threatened with death by starvation in Jamaica, where\r\nthe contumacious savages refused to give him provisions. Forewarned of\r\nthe arrival of this eclipse by the astronomical almanacs, he threatened\r\nto deprive the Caribs of the light of the Moon--and kept his word. The\r\neclipse had hardly begun when the terrified Indians flung themselves at\r\nhis feet, and brought him all that he required.\r\n\r\nIn all times and among all people we find traces of popular\r\nsuperstitions connected with eclipses. Here, the abnormal absence of the\r\nMoon's light is regarded as a sign of divine anger: the humble penitents\r\nbetake themselves to prayer to ward off the divine anger. There, the\r\ncruelty of the dread dragon is to be averted: he must be chased away by\r\ncries and threats, and the sky is bombarded with shots to deliver the\r\nvictim from his monstrous oppressor.\r\n\r\nIn France the announcement of a solar eclipse for August 21, 1560, so\r\ngreatly disturbed our ancestors' peace of mind as to make them idiotic.\r\nPreparations were made for assisting at an alarming phenomenon that\r\nthreatened Humanity with deadly consequences! The unhappy eclipse had\r\nbeen preceded by a multitude of ill omens! Some expected a great\r\nrevolution in the provinces and in Rome, others predicted a new\r\nuniversal deluge, or, on the other hand, the conflagration of the world;\r\nthe most optimistic thought the air would be contaminated. To preserve\r\nthemselves from so many dangers, and in accordance with the physicians'\r\norders, numbers of frightened people shut themselves up in tightly\r\nclosed and perfumed cellars, where they awaited the decrees of Fate. The\r\napproach of the phenomenon increased the panic, and it is said that one\r\nvillage _curé_, being unable to hear the confessions of all his flock,\r\nwho wanted to discharge their souls of sin before taking flight for a\r\nbetter world, was fain to tell them \"there was no hurry, because the\r\neclipse had been put off a fortnight on account of the number of\r\npenitents\"!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--Eclipse of the Moon at Laos (February 27,\r\n1877).]\r\n\r\nThese fears and terrors are still extant among ignorant peoples. In the\r\nnight of February 27, 1877, an eclipse of the Moon produced an\r\nindescribable panic among the inhabitants of Laos (Indo-China). In order\r\nto frighten off the Black Dragon, the natives fired shots at the\r\nhalf-devoured orb, accompanying their volley with the most appalling\r\nyells. Dr. Harmand has memorialized the scene in the lively sketch given\r\non p. 269.\r\n\r\nDuring the solar eclipse of March 15, 1877, an analogous scene occurred\r\namong the Turks, who for the moment forgot their preparations for war\r\nwith Russia, in order to shoot at the Sun, and deliver him from the\r\ntoils of the Dragon.\r\n\r\nThe lunar eclipse of December 16, 1880, was not unnoticed at Tackhent\r\n(Russian Turkestan), where it was received with a terrific din of\r\nsaucepans, samovars and various implements struck together again and\r\nagain by willing hands that sought to deliver the Moon from the demon\r\nTchaitan who was devouring her.\r\n\r\nIn China, eclipses are the object of imposing ceremonies, whose object\r\nis to reestablish the regularity of the celestial motions. Since the\r\nEmperor is regarded as the Son of Heaven, his government must in some\r\nsort be a reflection of the immutable order of the sidereal harmonies.\r\nAs eclipses were regarded by astrologers as disturbances of the divine\r\norder, their appearance indicates some irregularity in the government of\r\nthe Celestial Empire. Accordingly, they are received with all kinds of\r\nexpiatory ceremonies prescribed thousands of years ago, and still in\r\nforce to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the twentieth century, as in the nineteenth, the eighteenth, or in\r\nancient epochs, the same awe and terror operates upon the ignorant\r\npopulations who abound upon the surface of our planet.\r\n\r\nTo return to astronomical realities.\r\n\r\nWe said above that these phenomena were produced when the Full Moon and\r\nthe New Moon reached the line of intersection, known as the line of\r\nnodes, when the plane of the lunar orbit cuts the plane of the ecliptic.\r\nAs this line turns and comes back in the same direction relatively to\r\nthe Sun at the end of eighteen years, eleven days, we have only to\r\nregister the eclipses observed during this period in order to know all\r\nthat will occur in the future, and to find such as happened in the past.\r\nThis period was known to the Greeks under the name of the Metonic Cycle,\r\nand the Chaldeans employed it three thousand years ago under the name of\r\nSaros.\r\n\r\nOn examining this cycle, composed of 223 lunations, we see that there\r\ncan not be more than seven eclipses in one year, nor less than two. When\r\nthere are only two, they are eclipses of the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe totality of a solar eclipse can not last more than seven minutes,\r\nfifty-eight seconds at the equator, and six minutes, ten seconds in the\r\nlatitude of Paris. The Moon, on the contrary, may be entirely eclipsed\r\nfor nearly two hours.\r\n\r\nEclipses of the Sun are very rare for a definite spot. Thus not one\r\noccurred for Paris during the whole of the nineteenth century, the last\r\nwhich happened exactly above the capital of France having been on May\r\n22, 1724. I have calculated all those for the twentieth century, and\r\nfind that two will take place close to Paris, on April 17, 1912, at\r\neighteen minutes past noon (total for Choisy-le-Roi, Longjumeau, and\r\nDourdan, but very brief: seven seconds), and August 11, 1999, at 10.28\r\nA.M. (total for Beauvais, Compiègne, Amiens, St. Quentin, fairly long:\r\ntwo minutes, seventeen seconds). Paris itself will not be favored before\r\nAugust 12, 2026. In order to witness the phenomenon, one must go and\r\nlook for it. This the author did on May 28, 1900, in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the lunar shadow upon the surface of the Earth is traced\r\nbeforehand on maps that serve to show the favored countries for which\r\nour satellite will dispense her ephemeral night. The above figure shows\r\nthe trajectory of the total phase of the 1900 eclipse in Portugal,\r\nSpain, Algeria, and Tunis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--The path of the Eclipse of May 28, 1900.]\r\n\r\nThe immutable splendor of the celestial motions had never struck the\r\nauthor so impressively as during the observation of this grandiose\r\nphenomenon. With the absolute precision of astronomical calculations,\r\nour satellite, gravitating round the Earth, arrived upon the theoretical\r\nline drawn from the orb of day to our planet, and interposed itself\r\ngradually, slowly, and exactly, in front of it. The eclipse was total,\r\nand occurred at the moment predicted by calculation. Then the obscure\r\nglobe of the Moon pursued its regular course, discovered the radiant orb\r\nbehind, and gradually and slowly completed its transit in front of him.\r\nHere, to all observers, was a double philosophical lesson, a twofold\r\nimpression: that of the greatness, the omnipotence of the inexorable\r\nforces that govern the universe, and that of the inexorable valor of\r\nman, of this thinking atom straying upon another atom, who by the\r\ntravail of his feeble intelligence has arrived at the knowledge of the\r\nlaws by which he, like the rest of the world, is borne away through\r\nspace, through time, and through eternity.\r\n\r\nThe line of centrality passed through Elche, a picturesque city of\r\n30,000 inhabitants, not far from Alicante, and we had chosen this for\r\nour station on account of the probability of fine weather.\r\n\r\nFrom the terrace of the country house of the hospitable Mayor, a farm\r\ntransformed into an observatory by our learned friend, Count de la Baume\r\nPluvinel, there were no obstacles between ourselves and any part of the\r\nsky or landscape. The whole horizon lay before us. In front was a town\r\nof Arab aspect framed in a lovely oasis of palm-trees; a little farther\r\noff, the blue sea beyond the shores of Alicante and Murcia: on the\r\nother side a belt of low mountains, and near us fields and gardens. A\r\nCompany of the Civic Guard kept order, and prevented the entrance of too\r\nmany curious visitors, of whom over ten thousand had arrived.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the first contact of the lunar disk with the solar\r\ndisk was observed in the telescope, we fired a gun, in order to announce\r\nthe precise commencement of the occultation to the 40,000 persons who\r\nwere awaiting the phenomenon, and to discover what difference would\r\nexist between this telescopic observation and those made with the\r\nunaided eyes (protected simply by a bit of smoked glass) of so many\r\nimprovised spectators. This had already been done by Arago at Perpignan\r\nin 1842. The verification was almost immediate for the majority of eyes,\r\nand may be estimated at eight or ten seconds. So that the commencement\r\nof the eclipse was confirmed almost as promptly for the eye as with the\r\nastronomical instruments.\r\n\r\nThe sky was splendidly clear; no cloud, no mist, deep blue; blazing Sun.\r\nThe first period of the eclipse showed nothing particular. It is only\r\nfrom the moment when more than half the solar disk is covered by the\r\nlunar disk that the phenomenon is imposing in its grandeur. At this\r\nphase, I called the attention of the people standing in the court to the\r\nvisibility of the stars, and indicating the place of Venus in the sky\r\nasked if any with long sight could perceive her. Eight at once\r\nresponded in the affirmative. It should be said that the planet was at\r\nthat time at its period of maximum brilliancy, when for observers\r\nblessed with good sight, it is always visible to the unaided eye.\r\n\r\nWhen some three-quarters of the Sun were eclipsed, the pigeons which had\r\nflown back to the farm huddled into a corner, and made no further\r\nmovement. They told me that evening that the fowls had done the same a\r\nlittle later, returning to the hen-house as though it had been night,\r\nand that the small children (who were very numerous at Elche, where the\r\npopulation is certainly not diminishing) left off their games, and came\r\nback to their mothers' skirts. The birds flew anxiously to their nests.\r\nThe ants in one garden were excessively agitated, no doubt disconcerted\r\nin their strategics. The bats came out.\r\n\r\nA few days before the eclipse I had prepared the inhabitants of this\r\npart of Spain for the observation of the phenomenon by the following\r\ndescription, which sums up the previous accounts of the astronomers:\r\n\r\n\"The spectacle of a total eclipse of the Sun is one of the most\r\nmagnificent and imposing that it is possible to see in nature. At the\r\nexact moment indicated by calculation, the Moon arrives in front of the\r\nSun, eats into it gradually, and at last entirely covers it. The light\r\nof the day lessens and is transformed. A sense of oppression is felt by\r\nall nature, the birds are hushed, the dog takes refuge with his master,\r\nthe chickens hide beneath their mother's wing, the wind drops, the\r\ntemperature falls, an appalling stillness is everywhere perceptible, as\r\nthough the universe were on the verge of some imminent catastrophe.\r\nMen's faces assume a cadaverous hue similar to that given at night by\r\nthe flame of spirits of wine and salt, a livid funereal light, the\r\nsinister illumination of the world's last hour.\r\n\r\n\"At the moment when the last line of the solar crescent disappears, we\r\nsee, instead of the Sun, a black disk surrounded with a splendid\r\nluminous aureole shooting immense jets into space, with roseate flames\r\nburning at the base.\r\n\r\n\"A sudden night has fallen on us, a weird, wan night in which the\r\nbrightest of the stars are visible in the Heavens. The spectacle is\r\nsplendid, grandiose, solemn, and sublime.\"\r\n\r\nThis impression was actually felt by us all, as may be seen from the\r\nfollowing notes, written in my schedule of observation during the event,\r\nor immediately after:\r\n\r\n\"3.50 P.M. Light very weak, sky leaden gray, mountains standing out with\r\nremarkable clearness from the horizon, and seeming to approach us.\r\n\r\n\"3.55 P.M. Fall of temperature very apparent. Cold wind blowing through\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\"3.56 P.M. Profound silence through nature, which seems to participate\r\nin the celestial phenomenon. Silence in all the groups.\r\n\r\n\"3.57 P.M. Light considerably diminished, becoming wan, strange, and\r\nsinister. Landscape leaden gray, sea looks black. This diminution of\r\nlight is not that of every day after the sunset. There is, as it were, a\r\ntint of sadness spread over the whole of nature. One becomes accustomed\r\nto it, and yet while we know that the occultation of the Sun by the Moon\r\nis a natural phenomenon, we can not escape a certain sense of\r\nuneasiness. The approach of some extraordinary spectacle is imminent.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point we examined the effects of the solar light upon the seven\r\ncolors of the spectrum. In order to determine as accurately as possible\r\nthe tonality of the light of the eclipse, I had prepared seven great\r\nsheets, each painted boldly in the colors of the spectrum, violet,\r\nindigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red; and a similar series in pieces\r\nof silk. These colors were laid at our feet upon the terrace where my\r\nwife, as well as Countess de la Baume, were watching with me. We then\r\nsaw the first four disappear successively and entirely and turn black in\r\na few seconds, in the following order: violet, indigo, blue, green. The\r\nthree other colors were considerably attenuated by the darkness, but\r\nremained visible.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that in the normal order of things--that is, every\r\nevening--the contrary appears; violet remains visible after the red.\r\n\r\nThis experiment shows that the last light emitted by the eclipsed Sun\r\nbelongs to the least refrangible rays, to the greatest wave-lengths, to\r\nthe slowest vibrations, to the yellow and red rays. Such therefore is\r\nthe predominating color of the solar atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis experiment completed, we turn back to the Sun. Magical and splendid\r\nspectacle! Totality has commenced, the Sun has disappeared, the black\r\ndisk of the Moon covers it entirely, leaving all round it a magnificent\r\ncorona of dazzling light. One would suppose it to be an annular eclipse,\r\nwith the difference that this can be observed with the naked eye,\r\nwithout fatigue to the retina, and drawn quietly.\r\n\r\nThis luminous coronal atmosphere entirely surrounds the solar disk, at a\r\npretty equal depth, equivalent to about the third of half the solar\r\ndiameter. It may be regarded as the Sun's atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBeyond this corona is an aureole, of vaster glory but less luminous,\r\nwhich sends out long plumes, principally in the direction of the\r\nequatorial zone of the Sun, and of the belt of activity of the spots and\r\nprominences.\r\n\r\nAt the summit of the disk it is conical in shape. Below it is double,\r\nand its right-hand portion ends in a point, not far from Mercury, which\r\nshines like a dazzling star of first magnitude, and seems placed there\r\nexpressly to give us the extent and direction of the solar aureole.\r\n\r\nI draw these various aspects (which, moreover, change with the movement\r\nof the Moon), and what strikes me most is the distinction in light\r\nbetween this aureole and the coronal atmosphere; the latter appears to\r\nbe a brilliant silvery white, the former is grayer and certainly less\r\ndense.\r\n\r\nMy impression is that there are _two solar envelopes of entirely\r\ndifferent nature_, the corona belonging to the globe of the Sun, and\r\nforming its atmosphere properly so-called, very luminous; the aureole\r\nformed of particles that circulate independently round it, probably\r\narising from eruptions, their form as a whole being possibly due to\r\nelectric or magnetic forces, counterbalanced by resistances of various\r\nnatures. In our own atmosphere the volcanic eruptions are distinct from\r\nthe aerial envelope.\r\n\r\nThe general configuration of this external halo, spreading more\r\nparticularly in the equatorial zone, is sufficiently like that of the\r\neclipse of 1889, published in my _Popular Astronomy_, which also\r\ncorresponded with a minimum of solar energy. The year 1900 is in fact\r\nclose upon the minimum of the eleven-year period. This equatorial form\r\nis, moreover, what all the astronomers were expecting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Total eclipse of the Sun, May 28, 1900, as\r\nobserved from Elche (Spain).]\r\n\r\nThere can no longer be the slightest doubt that the solar envelope\r\nvaries with the activity of the Sun....\r\n\r\n\"But the total eclipse lasted a much shorter time than I have taken to\r\nwrite these lines. The seventy-nine seconds of totality are over. A\r\ndazzling light bursts from the Sun, and tells that the Moon pursuing its\r\norbit has left it. The splendid sight is over. It has gone like a\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\n\"Already over! It is almost a disillusion. Nothing beautiful lasts in\r\nthis world. Too sad! If only the celestial spectacle could have lasted\r\ntwo, three, or four minutes! It was too short....\r\n\r\n\"Alas! we are forced to take things as they are.\r\n\r\n\"The surprise, the oppression, the terror of some, the universal silence\r\nare over. The Sun reappears in his splendor, and the life of nature\r\nresumes its momentarily suspended course.\r\n\r\n\"While I was making my drawing, M. l'Abbé Moreux, my colleague from the\r\nAstronomical Society of France, who accompanied me to Spain for this\r\nobservation, was taking one of his own, without any reciprocal\r\ncommunication. These two sketches are alike, and confirmatory.\r\n\r\n\"The differential thermometers that I exposed to the Sun, hanging\r\nfreely, and protected from reflection from the ground, were read every\r\nfive minutes. The black thermometer went down from 33.1° to 20.7°, that\r\nis 12.4°; the white from 29° to 20.2°--that is, 8.8°. The temperature in\r\nthe shade only varied three degrees.\r\n\r\n\"The light received during totality was due: first, to the luminous\r\nenvelope of the Sun; second, to that of the terrestrial atmosphere,\r\nilluminated at forty kilometers (twenty-five miles) on the one side and\r\nthe other of the line of centrality. It appeared to be inferior to that\r\nof the Full Moon, on account of the almost sudden transition. But, in\r\nreality, it was more intense, for only first-magnitude stars were\r\nvisible in the sky, whereas on a night of full moon, stars of second,\r\nand even of third magnitude are visible. We recognized, among others,\r\nVenus, Mercury, Sirius, Procyon, Capella, Rigel, Betelgeuse.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom these notes, taken on the spot, it is evident that the\r\ncontemplation of a total eclipse of the Sun is one of the most marvelous\r\nspectacles that can be admired upon our planet.\r\n\r\nSome persons assured me that they saw the shadow of the Moon flying\r\nrapidly over the landscape. My attention was otherwise occupied, and I\r\nwas unable to verify this interesting observation. The shadow of the\r\nMoon in effect took only eleven minutes (3.47 P.M. to 3.58 P.M.) to\r\ntraverse the Iberian Peninsula from Porto to Alicante, _i.e._, a\r\ndistance of 766 kilometers (475 miles). It must therefore have passed\r\nover the ground at a velocity of sixty-nine kilometers per minute, or\r\n1,150 meters per second, a speed higher than that of a bullet. It can\r\neasily be watched from afar, on the mountains.\r\n\r\nSome weeks previous to this fine eclipse, when I informed the Spaniards\r\nof the belt along which it could be observed, I had invited them to note\r\nall the interesting phenomena they might witness, including the effects\r\nproduced by the eclipse upon animals. Birds returned hurriedly to their\r\nnests, swallows lost themselves, sheep huddled into compact packs,\r\npartridges were hypnotized, frogs croaked as if it were night, fowls\r\ntook refuge in the hen-house, and cocks crowed, bats came out, and were\r\nsurprised by the sun, chicks gathered under their mothers' wing,\r\ncage-birds ceased their songs, some dogs howled, others crept shivering\r\nto their masters' feet, ants returned to the antheap, grasshoppers\r\nchirped as at sunset, pigeons sank to the ground, a swarm of bees went\r\nsilently back to their hive, and so on.\r\n\r\nThese creatures behaved as though the night had come, but there were\r\nalso signs of fear, surprise, even of terror, differing only \"in degree\"\r\nfrom those manifested during the grandiose phenomenon of a total\r\neclipse by human beings unenlightened by a scientific education.\r\n\r\nAt Madrid the eclipse was only partial. The young King of Spain, Alfonso\r\nXIII, took care to photograph it, and I offer the photograph to my\r\nreaders (Fig. 79), as this amiable sovereign did me the honor to give it\r\nme a few days after the eclipse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--The Eclipse of May 28, 1900, as photographed by\r\nKing Alfonso XIII, at Madrid.]\r\n\r\nThe technical results of these observations of solar eclipses relate\r\nmore especially to the elucidation of the grand problem of the physical\r\nconstitution of the Sun. We alluded to them in the chapter devoted to\r\nthis orb. The last great total eclipses have been of immense value to\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe eclipses of the Moon are less important, less interesting, than the\r\neclipses of the Sun. Yet their aspect must not be neglected on this\r\naccount, and it may be said to vary for each eclipse.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, our satellite does not disappear entirely in the\r\nEarth's cone of shadow; the solar rays are refracted round our globe by\r\nour atmosphere, and curving inward, illumine the lunar globe with a rosy\r\ntint that reminds one of the sunset. Sometimes, indeed, this refraction\r\ndoes not occur, owing doubtless to lack of transparency in the\r\natmosphere, and the Moon becomes invisible. This happened recently, on\r\nApril 11, 1903.\r\n\r\nFor any spot, eclipses of the Moon are incomparably more frequent than\r\neclipses of the Sun, because the cone of lunar shadow that produces the\r\nsolar eclipses is not very broad at its contact with the surface of the\r\nglobe (10, 20, 30, 50, 100 kilometers, according to the distance of the\r\nMoon), whereas all the countries of the Earth for which the Moon is\r\nabove the horizon at the hour of the lunar eclipse are able to see it.\r\nIt is at all times a remarkable spectacle that uplifts our thoughts to\r\nthe Heavens, and I strongly advise my readers on no account to forego\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nON METHODS\r\n\r\nHOW CELESTIAL DISTANCES ARE DETERMINED, AND HOW THE SUN IS WEIGHED\r\n\r\n\r\nI will not do my readers the injustice to suppose that they will be\r\nalarmed at the title of this Lesson, and that they do not employ some\r\n\"method\" in their own lives. I even assume that if they have been good\r\nenough to take me on faith when I have spoken of the distances of the\r\nSun and Moon, and Stars, or of the weight of bodies at the surface of\r\nMars, they retain some curiosity as to how the astronomers solve these\r\nproblems. Hence it will be as interesting as it is useful to complete\r\nthe preceding statements by a brief summary of the methods employed for\r\nacquiring these bold conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe Sun seems to touch the Earth when it disappears in the purple mists\r\nof twilight: an immense abyss separates us from it. The stars go hand in\r\nhand down the constellated sky; and yet one can not think of their\r\ninconceivable distance without a shiver.\r\n\r\nOur neighbor, Moon, floats in space, a stone's throw from us: but\r\nwithout calculation we should never know the distance, which remains an\r\nimpassable desert to us.\r\n\r\nThe best educated persons sometimes find it difficult to admit that\r\nthese distances of Sun and Moon are better determined and more precise\r\nthan those of certain points on our minute planet. Hence, it is of\r\nparticular moment for us to give an exact account of the means employed\r\nin determining them.\r\n\r\nThe calculation of these distances is made by \"_triangulation_.\" This\r\nprocess is the same that surveyors use in the measurement of terrestrial\r\ndistances. There is nothing very alarming about it. If the word repels\r\nus a little at first, it is from its appearance only.\r\n\r\nWhen the distance of an object is unknown, the only means of expressing\r\nits apparent size is by measurement of the angle which it subtends\r\nbefore our eyes.\r\n\r\nWe all know that an object appears smaller, in proposition with its\r\ndistance from us. This diminution is not a matter of chance. It is\r\ngeometric, and proportional to the distance. Every object removed to a\r\ndistance of 57 times its diameter measures an angle of 1 degree,\r\nwhatever its real dimensions. Thus a sphere 1 meter in diameter measures\r\nexactly 1 degree, if we see it at a distance of 57 meters. A statue\r\nmeasuring 1.80 meters (about 5 ft. 8 in.) will be equal to an angle of 1\r\ndegree, if distant 57 times its height, that is to say, at 102.60\r\nmeters. A sheet of paper, size 1 decimeter, seen at 5.70 meters,\r\nrepresents the same magnitude.\r\n\r\nIn length, a degree is the 57th part of the radius of a circle, _i.e._,\r\nfrom the circumference to the center.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of an angle is expressed in parts of the circumference.\r\nNow, what is an angle of a degree? It is the 360th part of any\r\ncircumference. On a table 3.60 meters round, an angle of one degree is a\r\ncentimeter, seen from the center of the table. Trace on a sheet of paper\r\na circle 0.360 meters round--an angle of 1 degree is a millimeter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Measurement of Angles.]\r\n\r\nIf the circumference of a circus measuring 180 meters be divided into\r\n360 places, each measuring 0.50 meters in width, then when the circus is\r\nfull a person placed at the center will see each spectator occupying an\r\nangle of 1 degree. The angle does not alter with the distance, and\r\nwhether it be measured at 1 meter, 10 meters, 100 kilometers, or in the\r\ninfinite spaces of Heaven, it is always the same angle. Whether a degree\r\nbe represented by a meter or a kilometer, it always remains a degree. As\r\nangles measuring less than a degree often have to be calculated, this\r\nangle has been subdivided into 60 parts, to which the name of _minutes_\r\nhas been given, and each minute into 60 parts or _seconds_. Written\r\nshort, the degree is indicated by a little zero (°) placed above the\r\nfigure; the minute by an apostrophe ('), and the second by two (\").\r\nThese minutes and seconds of _arc_ have no relation with the same terms\r\nas employed for the division of the duration of time. These latter ought\r\nnever to be written with the signs of abbreviation just indicated,\r\nthough journalists nowadays set a somewhat pedantic example, by writing,\r\n_e.g._, for an automobile race, 4h. 18' 30\", instead of 4h. 18m. 30s.\r\n\r\nThis makes clear the distinction between the relative measure of an\r\nangle and the absolute measures, such, for instance, as the meter. Thus,\r\na degree may be measured on this page, while a second (the 3,600th part\r\nof a degree) measured in the sky may correspond to millions of\r\nkilometers.\r\n\r\nNow the measure of the Moon's diameter gives us an angle of a little\r\nmore than half a degree. If it were exactly half a degree, we should\r\nknow by that that it was 114 times the breadth of its disk away from us.\r\nBut it is a little less, since we have more than half a degree (31'),\r\nand the geometric ratio tells us that the distance of our satellite is\r\n110 times its diameter.\r\n\r\nHence we have very simply obtained a first idea of the distance of the\r\nMoon by the measure of its diameter. Nothing could be simpler than this\r\nmethod. The first step is made. Let us continue.\r\n\r\nThis approximation tells us nothing as yet of the real distance of the\r\norb of night. In order to know this distance in miles, we need to know\r\nthe width in miles of the lunar disk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--Division of the Circumference into 360\r\ndegrees.]\r\n\r\nThis problem has been solved, as follows:\r\n\r\nTwo observers go as far as possible from each other, and observe the\r\nMoon simultaneously, from two stations situated on the same meridian,\r\nbut having a wide difference of latitude. The distance that separates\r\nthe two points of observation forms the base of a triangle, of which the\r\ntwo long sides come together on the Moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Measurement of the distance of the Moon.]\r\n\r\nIt is by this proceeding that the distance of our satellite was finally\r\nestablished, in 1751 and 1752, by two French astronomers, Lalande and\r\nLacaille; the former observing at Berlin, the latter at the Cape of Good\r\nHope. The result of their combined observations showed that the angle\r\nformed at the center of the lunar disk by the half-diameter of the Earth\r\nis 57 minutes of arc (a little less than a degree). This is known as the\r\n_parallax_ of the Moon.\r\n\r\nHere is a more or less alarming word; yet it is one that we can not\r\ndispense with in discussing the distance of the stars. This astronomical\r\nterm will soon become familiar in the course of the present lesson,\r\nwhere it will frequently recur, and always in connection with the\r\nmeasurement of celestial distances. \"Do not let us fear,\" wrote Lalande\r\nin his _Astronomie des Dames_, \"do not let us fear to use the term\r\nparallax, despite its scientific aspect; it is convenient, and this term\r\nexplains a very simple and very familiar effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"If one is at the play,\" he continues, \"behind a woman whose hat is too\r\nlarge, and prevents one from seeing the stage [written a hundred years\r\nago!], one leans to the left or right, one rises or stoops: all this is\r\na parallax, a diversity of aspect, in virtue of which the hat appears to\r\ncorrespond with another part of the theater from that in which are the\r\nactors.\" \"It is thus,\" he adds, \"that there may be an eclipse of the Sun\r\nin Africa and none for us, and that we see the Sun perfectly, because we\r\nare high enough to prevent the Moon's hiding it from us.\"\r\n\r\nSee how simple it is. This parallax of 57 minutes proves that the Earth\r\nis removed from the Moon at a distance of about 60 times its\r\nhalf-diameter (precisely, 60.27). From this to the distance of the Moon\r\nin kilometers is only a step, because it suffices to multiply the\r\nhalf-diameter of the Earth, which is 6,371 kilometers (3,950 miles) by\r\nthis number. The distance of our satellite, accordingly, is 6,371\r\nkilometers, multiplied by 60.27--that is, 384,000 kilometers (238,000\r\nmiles). The parallax of the Moon not only tells us definitely the\r\ndistance of our planet, but also permits us to calculate its real volume\r\nby the measure of its apparent volume. As the diameter of the Moon seen\r\nfrom the Earth subtends an angle of 31', while that of the Earth seen\r\nfrom the Moon is 114', the real diameter of the orb of night must be to\r\nthat of the terrestrial globe in the relation of 273 to 1,000. That is a\r\nlittle more than a quarter, or 3,480 kilometers (2,157 miles), the\r\ndiameter of our planet being 12,742 kilometers (7,900 miles).\r\n\r\nThis distance, calculated thus by geometry, is positively determined\r\nwith greater precision than that employed in the ordinary measurements\r\nof terrestrial distances, such as the length of a road, or of a railway.\r\nThis statement may seem to be a romance to many, but it is undeniable\r\nthat the distance separating the Earth from the Moon is measured with\r\ngreater care than, for instance, the length of the road from Paris to\r\nMarseilles, or the weight of a pound of sugar at the grocer's. (And we\r\nmay add without comment, that the astronomers are incomparably more\r\nconscientious in their measurements than the most scrupulous\r\nshop-keepers.)\r\n\r\nHad we conveyed ourselves to the Moon in order to determine its distance\r\nand its diameter directly, we should have arrived at no greater\r\nprecision, and we should, moreover, have had to plan out a journey\r\nwhich in itself is the most insurmountable of all the problems.\r\n\r\nThe Moon is at the frontier of our little terrestrial province: one\r\nmight say that it traces the limits of our domain in space. And yet, a\r\ndistance of 384,000 kilometers (238,000 miles) separates the planet from\r\nthe satellite. This space is insignificant in the immeasurable distances\r\nof Heaven: for the Saturnians (if such exist!) the Earth and the Moon\r\nare confounded in one tiny star; but for the inhabitants of our globe,\r\nthe distance is beyond all to which we are accustomed. Let us try,\r\nhowever, to span it in thought.\r\n\r\nA cannon-ball at constant speed of 500 meters (547 yards) per second\r\nwould travel 8 days, 5 hours to reach the Moon. A train started at a\r\nspeed of one kilometer per minute, would arrive at the end of an\r\nuninterrupted journey in 384,000 minutes, or 6,400 hours, or 266 days,\r\n16 hours. And in less than the time it takes to write the name of the\r\nQueen of Night, a telegraphic message would convey our news to the Moon\r\nin one and a quarter seconds.\r\n\r\nLong-distance travelers who have been round the world some dozen times\r\nhave journeyed a greater distance.\r\n\r\nThe other stars (beginning with the Sun) are incomparably farther from\r\nus. Yet it has been found possible to determine their distances, and\r\nthe same method has been employed.\r\n\r\nBut it will at once be seen that different measures are required in\r\ncalculating the distance of the Sun, 388 times farther from us than the\r\nMoon, for from here to the orb of day is 12,000 times the breadth of our\r\nplanet. Here we must not think of erecting a triangle with the diameter\r\nof the Earth for its base: the two ideal lines drawn from the\r\nextremities of this diameter would come together between the Earth and\r\nthe Sun; there would be no triangle, and the measurement would be\r\nabsurd.\r\n\r\nIn order to measure the distance which separates the Earth from the Sun,\r\nwe have recourse to the fine planet Venus, whose orbit is situated\r\ninside the terrestrial orbit. Owing to the combination of the Earth's\r\nmotion with that of the Star of the Morning and Evening, the capricious\r\nVenus passes in front of the Sun at the curious intervals of 8 years,\r\n113-1/2 years less 8 years, 8 years, 113-1/2 years plus 8 years.\r\n\r\nThus there was a transit in June, 1761, then another 8 years after, in\r\nJune, 1769. The next occurred 113-1/2 years less 8 years, _i.e._,\r\n105-1/2 years after the preceding, in December, 1874; the next in\r\nDecember, 1882. The next will be in June, 2004, and June, 2012. At these\r\neagerly anticipated epochs, astronomers watch the transit of Venus\r\nacross the Sun at two terrestrial stations as far as possible removed\r\nfrom each other, marking the two points at which the planet, seen from\r\ntheir respective stations, appears to be projected at the same moment on\r\nthe solar disk. This measure gives the width of an angle formed by two\r\nlines, which starting from two diametrically opposite points of the\r\nEarth, cross upon Venus, and form an identical angle upon the Sun. Venus\r\nis thus at the apex of two equal triangles, the bases of which rest,\r\nrespectively, upon the Earth and on the Sun. The measurement of this\r\nangle gives what is called the parallax of the Sun--that is, the angular\r\ndimension at which the Earth would be seen at the distance of the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Measurement of the distance of the Sun.]\r\n\r\nThus, it has been found that the half-diameter of the Earth viewed from\r\nthe Sun measures 8.82\". Now, we know that an object presenting an angle\r\nof one degree is at a distance of 57 times its length.\r\n\r\nThe same object, if it subtends an angle of a minute, or the sixtieth\r\npart of a degree, indicates by the measurement of its angle that it is\r\n60 times more distant, _i.e._, 3,438 times.\r\n\r\nFinally, an object that measures one second, or the sixtieth part of a\r\nminute, is at a distance of 206,265 times its length.\r\n\r\nHence we find that the Earth is at a distance from the Sun of\r\n206,265/8.82--that is, 23,386 times its half-diameter, that is,\r\n149,000,000 kilometers (93,000,000 miles). This measurement again is as\r\nprecise and certain as that of the Moon.\r\n\r\nI hope my readers will easily grasp this simple method of triangulation,\r\nthe result of which indicates to us with absolute certainty the distance\r\nof the two great celestial torches to which we owe the radiant light of\r\nday and the gentle illumination of our nights.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the Sun has, moreover, been confirmed by other means,\r\nwhose results agree perfectly with the preceding. The two principal are\r\nbased on the velocity of light. The propagation of light is not\r\ninstantaneous, and notwithstanding the extreme rapidity of its\r\nmovements, a certain time is required for its transmission from one\r\npoint to another. On the Earth, this velocity has been measured as\r\n300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second. To come from Jupiter to\r\nthe Earth, it requires thirty to forty minutes, according to the\r\ndistance of the planet. Now, in examining the eclipses of Jupiter's\r\nsatellites, it has been discovered that there is a difference of 16\r\nminutes, 34 seconds in the moment of their occurrence, according as\r\nJupiter is on one side or on the other of the Sun, relatively to the\r\nEarth, at the minimum and maximum distance. If the light takes 16\r\nminutes, 34 seconds to traverse the terrestrial orbit, it must take less\r\nthan that time, or 8 minutes, 17 seconds, to come to us from the Sun,\r\nwhich is situated at the center. Knowing the velocity of light, the\r\ndistance of the Sun is easily found by multiplying 300,000 by 8 minutes,\r\n17 seconds, or 497 seconds, which gives about 149,000,000 kilometers\r\n(93,000,000 miles).\r\n\r\nAnother method founded upon the velocity of light again gives a\r\nconfirmatory result. A familiar example will explain it: Let us imagine\r\nourselves exposed to a vertical rain; the degree of inclination of our\r\numbrella will depend on the relation between our speed and that of the\r\ndrops of rain. The more quickly we run, the more we need to dip our\r\numbrella in order not to meet the drops of water. Now the same thing\r\noccurs for light. The stars, disseminated in space, shed floods of light\r\nupon the Heavens. If the Earth were motionless, the luminous rays would\r\nreach us directly. But our planet is spinning, racing, with the utmost\r\nspeed, and in our astronomical observations we are forced to follow its\r\nmovements, and to incline our telescopes in the direction of its\r\nadvance. This phenomenon, known under the name of _aberration_ of light,\r\nis the result of the combined effects of the velocity of light and of\r\nthe Earth's motion. It shows that the speed of our globe is equivalent\r\nto 1/10000 that of light, _i.e._, = about 30 kilometers (19 miles) per\r\nsecond. Our planet accordingly accomplishes her revolution round the Sun\r\nalong an orbit which she traverses at a speed of 30 kilometers (better\r\n29-1/2) per second, or 1,770 kilometers per minute, or 106,000\r\nkilometers per hour, or 2,592,000 kilometers per day, or 946,080,000\r\nkilometers (586,569,600 miles) in the year. This is the length of the\r\nelliptical path described by the Earth in her annual translation.\r\n\r\nThe length of orbit being thus discovered, one can calculate its\r\ndiameter, the half of which is exactly the distance of the Sun.\r\n\r\nWe may cite one last method, whose data, based upon attraction, are\r\nprovided by the motions of our satellite. The Moon is a little disturbed\r\nin the regularity of her course round the Earth by the influence of the\r\npowerful Sun. As the attraction varies inversely with the square of the\r\ndistance, the distance may be determined by analyzing the effect it has\r\nupon the Moon.\r\n\r\nOther means, on which we will not enlarge in this summary of the methods\r\nemployed for determinations, confirm the precisions of these\r\nmeasurements with certainty. Our readers must forgive us for dwelling\r\nat some length upon the distance of the orb of day, since this\r\nmeasurement is of the highest importance; it serves as the base for the\r\nvaluation of all stellar distances, and may be considered as the meter\r\nof the universe.\r\n\r\nThis radiant Sun to which we owe so much is therefore enthroned in space\r\nat a distance of 149,000,000 kilometers (93,000,000 miles) from here.\r\nIts vast brazier must indeed be powerful for its influence to be exerted\r\nupon us to such a manifest extent, it being the very condition of our\r\nexistence, and reaching out as far as Neptune, thirty times more remote\r\nthan ourselves from the solar focus.\r\n\r\nIt is on account of its great distance that the Sun appears to us no\r\nlarger than the Moon, which is only 384,000 kilometers (238,000 miles)\r\nfrom here, and is itself illuminated by the brilliancy of this splendid\r\norb.\r\n\r\nNo terrestrial distance admits of our conceiving of this distance. Yet,\r\nif we associate the idea of space with the idea of time, as we have\r\nalready done for the Moon, we may attempt to picture this abyss. The\r\ntrain cited just now would, if started at a speed of a kilometer a\r\nminute, arrive at the Sun after an uninterrupted course of 283 years,\r\nand taking as long to return to the Earth the total would be 566 years.\r\nFourteen generations of stokers would be employed on this celestial\r\nexcursion before the bold travelers could bring back news of the\r\nexpedition to us.\r\n\r\nSound is transmitted through the air at a velocity of 340 meters (1,115\r\nfeet) per second. If our atmosphere reached to the Sun, the noise of an\r\nexplosion sufficiently formidable to be heard here would only reach us\r\nat the end of 13 years, 9 months. But the more rapid carriers, such as\r\nthe telegraph, would leap across to the orb of day in 8 minutes, 17\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nOur imagination is confounded before this gulf of 93,000,000 miles,\r\nacross which we see our dazzling Sun, whose burning rays fly rapidly\r\nthrough space in order to reach us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now let us see how the distances of the planets were determined.\r\n\r\nWe will leave aside the method of which we have been speaking; that now\r\nto be employed is quite different, but equally precise in its results.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the revolution of a planet round the Sun will be\r\nlonger in proportion as the distance is greater, and the orbit that has\r\nto be traveled vaster. This is simple. But the most curious thing is\r\nthat there is a geometric proportion in the relations between the\r\nduration of the revolutions of the planets and their distances. This\r\nproportion was discovered by Kepler, after thirty years of research,\r\nand embodied in the following formula:\r\n\r\n\"The squares of the times of revolution of the planets round the Sun\r\n(the periodic times) are proportional to the cubes of their mean\r\ndistances from the Sun.\"\r\n\r\nThis is enough to alarm the boldest reader. And yet, if we unravel this\r\nsomewhat incomprehensible phrase, we are struck with its simplicity.\r\n\r\nWhat is a square? We all know this much; it is taught to children of ten\r\nyears old. But lest it has slipped your memory: a square is simply a\r\nnumber multiplied by itself.\r\n\r\nThus: 2 × 2 = 4; 4 is the square of 2.\r\n\r\nFour times 4 is 16; 16 is the square of 4.\r\n\r\nAnd so on, indefinitely.\r\n\r\nNow, what is a cube? It is no more difficult. It is a number multiplied\r\ntwice by itself.\r\n\r\nFor instance: 2 multiplied by 2 and again by 2 equals 8. So 8 is the\r\ncube of 2. 3 × 3 × 3 = 27; 27 is the cube of 3, and so on.\r\n\r\nNow let us take an example that will show the simplicity and precision\r\nof the formula enunciated above. Let us choose a planet, no matter\r\nwhich. Say, Jupiter, the giant of the worlds. He is the Lord of our\r\nplanetary group. This colossal star is five times (precisely, 5.2) as\r\nfar from us as the Sun.\r\n\r\nMultiply this number twice by itself 5.2 × 5.2 × 5.2 = 140.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the revolution of Jupiter takes almost twelve years\r\n(11.85). This number multiplied by itself also equals 140. The square of\r\nthe number 11.85 is equal to the cube of the number 5.2. This very\r\nsimple law regulates all the heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nThus, to find the distance of a planet, it is sufficient to observe the\r\ntime of its revolution, then to discover the square of the given number\r\nby multiplying it into itself. The result of the operation gives\r\nsimultaneously the cube of the number that represents the distance.\r\n\r\nTo express this distance in kilometers (or miles), it is sufficient to\r\nmultiply it by 149,000,000 (in miles 93,000,000), the key to the system\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nNothing, then, could be less complicated than the definition of these\r\nmethods. A few moments of attention reveal to us in their majestic\r\nsimplicity the immutable laws that preside over the immense harmony of\r\nthe Heavens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut we must not confine ourselves to our own solar province. We have yet\r\nto speak of the stars that reign in infinite space far beyond our\r\nradiant Sun.\r\n\r\nStrange and audacious as it may appear, the human mind is able to cross\r\nthese heights, to rise on the wings of genius to these distant suns,\r\nand to plumb the depths of the abyss that separates us from these\r\ncelestial kingdoms.\r\n\r\nHere, we return to our first method, that of triangulation. And the\r\ndistance that separates us from the Sun must serve in calculating the\r\ndistances of the stars.\r\n\r\nThe Earth, spinning round the Sun at a distance of 149,000,000\r\nkilometers (93,000,000 miles), describes a circumference, or rather an\r\nellipse, of 936,000,000 kilometers (580,320,000 miles), which it travels\r\nover in a year. The distance of any point of the terrestrial orbit from\r\nthe diametrically opposite point which it passes six months later is\r\n298,000,000 kilometers (184,760,000 miles), _i.e._, the diameter of this\r\norbit. This immense distance (in comparison with those with which we are\r\nfamiliar) serves as the base of a triangle of which the apex is a star.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in exact measurements of the distance of a star consists\r\nin observing the little luminous point persistently for a whole year, to\r\nsee if this star is stationary, or if it describes a minute ellipse\r\nreproducing in perspective the annual revolution of the Earth.\r\n\r\nIf it remains fixed, it is lost in such depths of space that it is\r\nimpossible to gage the distance, and our 298,000,000 kilometers have no\r\nmeaning in view of such an abyss. If, on the contrary, it is displaced,\r\nit will in the year describe a minute ellipse, which is only the\r\nreflection, the perspective in miniature, of the revolution of our\r\nplanet round the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe annual parallax of a star is the angle under which one would see the\r\nradius, or half-diameter, of the terrestrial orbit from it. This radius\r\nof 149,000,000 kilometers (93,000,000 miles) is indeed, as previously\r\nobserved, the unit, the meter of celestial measures. The angle is of\r\ncourse smaller in proportion as the star is more distant, and the\r\napparent motion of the star diminishes in the same proportion. But the\r\nstars are all so distant that their annual displacement of perspective\r\nis almost imperceptible, and very exact instruments are required for its\r\ndetection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Small apparent ellipses described by the stars\r\nas a result of the annual displacement of the Earth.]\r\n\r\nThe researches of the astronomers have proved that there is not one star\r\nfor which the parallax is equal to that of another. The minuteness of\r\nthis angle, and the extraordinary difficulties experienced in measuring\r\nthe distance of the stars, will be appreciated from the fact that the\r\nvalue of a second is so small that the displacement of any star\r\ncorresponding with it could be covered by a spider's thread.\r\n\r\nA second of arc corresponds to the size of an object at a distance of\r\n206,265 times its diameter; to a millimeter seen at 206 meters'\r\ndistance; to a hair, 1/10 of a millimeter in thickness, at 20 meters'\r\ndistance (more invisible to the naked eye). And yet this value is in\r\nexcess of those actually obtained. In fact:--the apparent displacement\r\nof the nearest star is calculated at 75/100 of a second (0.75\"), _i.e._,\r\nfrom this star, [alpha] of Centaur, the half-diameter of the terrestrial\r\norbit is reduced to this infinitesimal dimension. Now in order that the\r\nlength of any straight line seen from the front be reduced until it\r\nappear to subtend no more than an angle of 0.75\", it must be removed to\r\na distance 275,000 times its length. As the radius of the terrestrial\r\norbit is 149,000,000 kilometers (93,000,000 miles), the distance which\r\nseparates [alpha] of Centaur from our world must therefore =\r\n41,000,000,000,000 kilometers (25,000,000,000,000 miles). And that is\r\nthe nearest star. We saw in Chapter II that it shines in the southern\r\nhemisphere. The next, and one that can be seen in our latitudes, is 61\r\nof Cygnus, which floats in the Heavens 68,000,000,000,000 kilometers\r\n(42,000,000,000,000 miles) from here. This little star, of fifth\r\nmagnitude, was the first of which the distance was determined (by\r\nBessel, 1837-1840).\r\n\r\nAll the rest are much more remote, and the procession is extended to\r\ninfinity.\r\n\r\nWe can not conceive directly of such distances, and in order to imagine\r\nthem we must again measure space by time.\r\n\r\nIn order to cover the distance that separates us from our neighbor,\r\n[alpha] of Centaur, _light_, the most rapid of all couriers, takes 4\r\nyears, 128 days. If we would follow it, we must not jump from start to\r\nfinish, for that would not give us the faintest idea of the distance: we\r\nmust take the trouble to think out the direct advance of the ray of\r\nlight, and associate ourselves with its progress. We must see it\r\ntraverse 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) during the first second of\r\nthe journey; then 300,000 more in the second, which makes 600,000\r\nkilometers; then once more 300,000 kilometers during the third, and so\r\non without stopping for four years and four months. If we take this\r\ntrouble we may realize the value of the figure; otherwise, as this\r\nnumber surpasses all that we are in the habit of realizing, it will have\r\nno significance for us, and will be a dead letter.\r\n\r\nIf some appalling explosion occurred in this star, and the sound in its\r\nflight of 340 meters (1,115 feet) per second were able to cross the\r\nvoid that separates us from it, the noise of this explosion would only\r\nreach us in 3,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nA train started at a speed of 106 kilometers (65 miles) per hour would\r\nhave to run for 46,000,000 years, in order to reach this star, our\r\nneighbor in the celestial kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe distance of some thirty of the stars has been determined, but the\r\nresults are dubious.\r\n\r\nThe dazzling Sirius reigns 92,000,000,000,000 kilometers\r\n(57,000,000,000,000 miles), the pale Vega at 204,000,000,000,000. Each\r\nof these magnificent stars must be a huge sun to burn at such a distance\r\nwith such luminosity. Some are millions of times larger than the Earth.\r\nMost of them are more voluminous than our Sun. On all sides they\r\nscintillate at inaccessible distances, and their light strays a long\r\nwhile in space before it encounters the Earth. The luminous ray that we\r\nreceive to-day from some pale star hardly perceptible to our eyes--so\r\nenormous is its distance--may perhaps bring us the last emanation of a\r\nsun that expired thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf these methods have been clear to my readers, they may also be\r\ninterested perhaps in knowing the means employed in weighing the worlds.\r\nThe process is as simple and as clear as those of which we have been\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n_Weighing the stars!_ Such a pretension seems Utopian, and one asks\r\noneself curiously what sort of balance the astronomers must have adopted\r\nin order to calculate the weight of Sun, Moon, planets or stars.\r\n\r\nHere, figures replace weights. Ladies proverbially dislike figures: yet\r\nit would be easier for some society dame to weigh the Sun at the point\r\nof her pen, by writing down a few columns of figures with a little care,\r\nthan to weigh a 12 kilogram case of fruit, or a dress-basket of 35\r\nkilos, by direct methods.\r\n\r\nWeighing the Sun is an amusement like any other, and a change of\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nIf the Moon were not attracted by the Earth, she would glide through the\r\nHeavens along an indefinite straight line, escaping at the tangent. But\r\nin virtue of the attraction that governs the movements of all the\r\nHeavenly bodies, our satellite at a distance of 60 times the terrestrial\r\nhalf-diameter revolves round us in 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, 11-1/2\r\nseconds, continually leaving the straight line to approach the Earth,\r\nand describing an almost circular orbit in space. If at any moment we\r\ntrace an arc of the lunar orbit, and if a tangent is taken to this arc,\r\nthe deviation from the straight line caused by the attraction of our\r\nplanet is found to be 1-1/3 millimeter per second.\r\n\r\nThis is the quantity by which the Moon drops toward us in each second,\r\nduring which she accomplishes 1,017 meters of her orbit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, no body can fall unless it be attracted, drawn by\r\nanother body of a more powerful mass.\r\n\r\nBeings, animals, objects, adhere to the soil, and weigh upon the Earth,\r\nbecause they are constantly attracted to it by an irresistible force.\r\n\r\nWeight and universal attraction are one and the same force.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it can be determined that if an object is left to\r\nitself upon the surface of the Earth, it drops 4.90 meters during the\r\nfirst second of its fall.\r\n\r\nWe also know that attraction diminishes with the square of the distance,\r\nand that if we could raise a stone to the height of the Moon, and then\r\nabandon it to the attraction of our planet, it would in the first second\r\nfall 4.90 meters divided by the square of 60, or 3,600--that is, of\r\n1-1/3 millimeters, exactly the quantity by which the Moon deviates from\r\nthe straight line she would pursue if the Earth were not influencing\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning just stated for the Moon is equally applicable to the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the Sun is 23,386 times the radius of the Earth. In\r\norder to know how much the intensity of terrestrial weight would be\r\ndiminished at such a distance, we should look, in the first place, for\r\nthe square of the number representing the distance--that is, 23,386\r\nmultiplied by itself, = 546,905,000. If we divide 4.90 meters, which\r\nrepresents the attractive force of our planet, by this number, we get\r\n9/1000000 of a millimeter, and we see that at the distance of the Sun,\r\nthe Earth's attraction would really be almost _nil_.\r\n\r\nNow let us do for our planet what we did for its satellite. Let us trace\r\nthe annual orbit of the terrestrial globe round the central orb, and we\r\nshall find that the Earth falls in each second 2.9 millimeters toward\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\nThis proportion gives the attractive force of the Sun in relation to\r\nthat of the Earth, and proves that the Sun is 324,000 times more\r\npowerful than our world, for 2.9 millimeters divided by 0.000,009 equals\r\n324,000, if worked out into the ultimate fractions neglected here for\r\nthe sake of simplicity.\r\n\r\nA great number of stars have been weighed by the same method.\r\n\r\nTheir mass is estimated by the movement of a satellite round them, and\r\nit is by this method that we are able to affirm that Jupiter is 310\r\ntimes heavier than the Earth, Saturn 92 times, Neptune 16 times, Uranus\r\n14 times, while Mars is much less heavy, its weight being only\r\ntwo-thirds that of our own.\r\n\r\nThe planets which have no satellites have been weighed by the\r\nperturbations which they cause in other stars, or in the imprudent\r\ncomets that sometimes tarry in their vicinity. Mercury weighs very much\r\nless than the Earth (only 6/100) and Venus about 8/10. So the beautiful\r\nstar of the evening and morning is not so light as her name might imply,\r\nand there is no great difference between her weight and our own.\r\n\r\nAs the Moon has no secondary body submitted to her influence, her weight\r\nhas been calculated by reckoning the amount of water she attracts at\r\neach tide in the ocean, or by observing the effects of her attraction on\r\nthe terrestrial globe. When the Moon is before us, in the last quarter,\r\nshe makes us travel faster, whereas in the first quarter, when she is\r\nbehind, she delays us.\r\n\r\nAll the calculations agree in showing us that the orb of night is 81\r\ntimes less heavy than our planet. There is nearly as much difference in\r\nweight between the Earth and the Moon as between an orange and a grape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot content with weighing the planets of our system, astronomers have\r\ninvestigated the weight of the stars. How have they been enabled to\r\nascertain the quantity of matter which constitutes these distant\r\nSuns--incandescent globes of fire scattered in the depths of space?\r\n\r\nThey have resorted to the same method, and it is by the study of the\r\nattractive influence of a sun upon some other contiguous neighboring\r\nstar, that the weight of a few of these has been calculated.\r\n\r\nOf course this method can only be applied to those double stars of which\r\nthe distance is known.\r\n\r\nIt has been discovered that some of the tiny stars that we can hardly\r\nsee twinkling in the depths of the azure sky are enormous suns, larger\r\nand heavier than our own, and millions of times more voluminous than the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nOur planet is only a grain of dust floating in the immensity of Heaven.\r\nYet this atom of infinity is the cradle of an immense creation\r\nincessantly renewed, and perpetually transformed by the accumulated\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nAnd what diversity exists in this army of worlds and suns, whose regular\r\nharmonious march obeys a mute order....\r\n\r\nBut we have as yet said nothing about weight on the surface of the\r\nworlds, and I see signs of impatience in my readers, for after so much\r\nsimple if unpoetical demonstration, they will certainly ask me for the\r\nexplanation that will prove to them that a kilogram transported to\r\nJupiter or Mars would weigh more or less than here.\r\n\r\nGive me your attention five minutes longer, and I will restore your\r\nfaith in the astronomers.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that objects at the surface of a world like\r\nJupiter, 310 times heavier than our own, weigh 310 times more. That\r\nwould be a serious error. In that case we should have to assume that a\r\nkilogram transported to the surface of the Sun would there weigh 324,000\r\ntimes more, or 324,000 kilograms. That would be correct if these orbs\r\nwere of the same dimensions as the Earth. But to speak, for instance,\r\nonly of the divine Sun, we know that he is 108 times larger than our\r\nlittle planet.\r\n\r\nNow, weight at the surface of a celestial body depends not only on its\r\nmass, but also on its diameter.\r\n\r\nIn order to know the weight of any body upon the surface of the Sun, we\r\nmust argue as follows:\r\n\r\nSince a body placed upon the surface of the Sun is 108 times farther\r\nfrom its center than it is upon a globe of the dimensions of the Earth,\r\nand since, on the other hand, attraction diminishes with the square of\r\nthe distance, the intensity of the weight would there be 108 multiplied\r\nby 108, or 11,700 times weaker. Now divide the number representing the\r\nmass, _i.e._, 324,000, by this number 11,700, and it results that bodies\r\nat the surface of the Sun are 28 times heavier than here. A woman whose\r\nweight was 60 kilos would weigh 1,680 kilograms there if organized in\r\nthe same way as on the Earth, and would find walking very difficult, for\r\nat each step she would lift up a shoe that weighed at least ten\r\nkilograms.\r\n\r\nThis reasoning as just stated for the Sun may be applied to the other\r\nstars. We know that on the surface of Jupiter the intensity of weight is\r\ntwice and a third times as great as here, while on Mars it only equals\r\n37/100.\r\n\r\nOn the surface of Mercury, weight is nearly twice as small again as\r\nhere. On Neptune it is approximately equal to our own.\r\n\r\nWith deference to the Selenites, everything is at its lightest on the\r\nMoon: a man weighing 70 kilograms on the Earth would not weigh more than\r\n12 kilos there.\r\n\r\nSo all tastes can be provided for: the only thing to be regretted is\r\nthat one can not choose one's planet with the same facility as one's\r\nresidence upon the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nLIFE, UNIVERSAL AND ETERNAL\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, while thanking my readers for having followed me so far in this\r\ndescriptive account of the marvels of the Cosmos, I must inquire what\r\nphilosophical impression has been produced on their minds by these\r\ncelestial excursions to the other worlds? Are you left indifferent to\r\nthe pageant of the Heavens? When your imagination was borne away to\r\nthese distant stars, suns of the infinite, these innumerable stellar\r\nsystems disseminated through a boundless eternity, did you ask what\r\nexisted there, what purpose was served by those dazzling spheres, what\r\neffects resulted from these forces, radiations, energies? Did you\r\nreflect that the elements which upon our little Earth determined a vital\r\nactivity so prodigious and so varied must needs have spread the waves of\r\nan incomparably vaster and more diversified existence throughout the\r\nimmensities of the Universe? Have you felt that all can not be dead and\r\ndeserted, as we are tempted by the illusions of our terrestrial senses\r\nand of our isolation to believe in the silence of the night: that on the\r\ncontrary, the real aim of Astronomy, instead of ending with statements\r\nof the positions and movements of the stars, is to enable us to\r\npenetrate to them, to make us divine, and know, and appreciate their\r\nphysical constitution, their degree of life and intellectuality in the\r\nuniversal order?\r\n\r\nOn the Earth, it is Life and Thought that flourish; and it is Life and\r\nThought that we seek again in these starry constellations strewn to\r\nInfinitude amid the immeasurable fields of Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe humble little planet that we inhabit presents itself to us as a\r\nbrimming cup, overflowing at every outlet. Life is everywhere. From the\r\nbottom of the seas, from the valleys to the mountains, from the\r\nvegetation that carpets the soil, from the mold in the fields and woods,\r\nfrom the air we breathe, arises an immense, prodigious, and perpetual\r\nmurmur. Listen! it is the great voice of Nature, the sum of all the\r\nunknown and mysterious voices that are forever calling to us, from the\r\nocean waves, from the forest winds, from the 300,000 kinds of insects\r\nthat are redundant everywhere, and make a lively community on the\r\nsurface of our globe. A drop of water contains thousands of curious and\r\nagile creatures. A grain of dust from the streets of Paris is the home\r\nof 130,000 bacteria. If we turn over the soil of a garden, field, or\r\nmeadow, we find the earthworms working to produce assimilable slime. If\r\nwe lift a stone in the path, we discover a crawling population. If we\r\ngather a flower, detach a leaf, we everywhere find little insects living\r\na parasitic existence. Swarms of midges fly in the sun, the trees of the\r\nwood are peopled with nests, the birds sing, and chase each other at\r\nplay, the lizards dart away at our approach, we trample down the\r\nantheaps and the molehills. Life enwraps us in an inexorable\r\nencroachment of which we are at once the heroes and the victims,\r\nperpetuating itself to its own detriment, as imposed upon it by an\r\neternal reproduction. And this from all time, for the very stones of\r\nwhich we build our houses are full of fossils so prodigiously multiplied\r\nthat one gram of such stone will often contain millions of shells,\r\nmarvels of geometrical perfection. The infinitely little is equal to the\r\ninfinitely great.\r\n\r\nLife appears to us as a fatal law, an imperious force which all obey, as\r\nthe result and the aim of the association of atoms. This is illustrated\r\nfor us upon the Earth, our only field of direct observation. We must be\r\nblind not to see this spectacle, deaf not to hear its reaching. On what\r\npretext could one suppose that our little globe which, as we have seen,\r\nhas received no privileges from Nature, is the exception; and that the\r\nentire Universe, save for one insignificant isle, is devoted to vacancy,\r\nsolitude, and death?\r\n\r\nWe have a tendency to imagine that Life can not exist under conditions\r\nother than terrestrial, and that the other worlds can only be inhabited\r\non the condition of being similar to our own. But terrestrial nature\r\nitself demonstrates to us the error of this way of thinking. We die in\r\nthe water: fishes die out of the water. Again, short-sighted naturalists\r\naffirm categorically that Life is impossible at the bottom of the sea:\r\n1, because it is in complete darkness; 2, because the terrible pressure\r\nwould burst any organism; 3, because all motion would be impossible\r\nthere, and so on. Some inquisitive person sends down a dredge, and\r\nbrings up lovely creatures, so delicate in structure that the daintiest\r\ntouch must proceed with circumspection. There is no light in these\r\ndepths: they make it with their own phosphorescence. Other inquirers\r\nvisit subterranean caverns, and discover animals and plants whose organs\r\nhave been transformed by adaptation to their gloomy environment.\r\n\r\nWhat right have we to say to the vital energy that radiates round every\r\nSun of the Universe: \"Thus far shalt thou come, and no further\"? In the\r\nname of Science? An absolute mistake. The Known is an infinitesimal\r\nisland in the midst of the vast ocean of the Unknown. The deep seas\r\nwhich seemed to be a barrier are, as we have seen, peopled with special\r\nlife. Some one objects: But after all, there is air there, there is\r\noxygen: oxygen is indispensable: a world without oxygen would be a\r\nworld of death, an eternally sterile desert. Why? Because we have not\r\nyet come across beings that can breathe without air, and live without\r\noxygen? Another mistake. Even if we did not know of any, it would not\r\nprove that they do not exist. But as it happens, we do know of such: the\r\n_anærobia_. These beings live without air, without oxygen. Better still:\r\noxygen kills them!\r\n\r\nAll the evidence goes to show that in interpreting as we ought the\r\nspectacle of terrestrial life, and the positive facts acquired by\r\nScience, we should enlarge the circle of our conceptions and our\r\njudgments, and not limit extra-terrestrial existence to the servile\r\nimage of what is in existence here below. Terrestrial organic forms are\r\ndue to local causes upon our planet. The chemical constitution of water\r\nand of the atmosphere, temperature, light, density, weight, are so many\r\nelements that have gone to form our bodies. Our flesh is composed of\r\ncarbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen combined in the state of water,\r\nand of some other elements, among which we may instance sodium chloride\r\n(salt). The flesh of animals is not chemically different from our own.\r\nAll this comes from the water and the air, and returns to them again.\r\nThe same elements, in very minute quantities, make up all living bodies.\r\nThe ox that browses on the grass is formed of the same flesh as the man\r\nwho eats the beef. All organized terrestrial matter is only carbon\r\ncombined in variable proportions with hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, etc.\r\n\r\nBut we have no right to forbid Nature to act differently in worlds from\r\nwhich carbon is absent. A world, for example, in which silica replaces\r\ncarbon, silicic acid carbonic acid, might be inhabited by organisms\r\nabsolutely different from those which exist on the Earth, different not\r\nonly in form, but also in substance. We already know stars and suns for\r\nwhich spectral analysis reveals a predominance of silica, _e.g._, Rigel\r\nand Deneb. In a world where chlorine predominated, we might expect to\r\nfind hydrochloric acid, and all the fecund family of chlorides, playing\r\nan important part in the phenomena of life. Might not bromine be\r\nassociated in other formations? Why, indeed, should we draw the line at\r\nterrestrial chemistry? What is to prove that these elements are really\r\nsimple? May not hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur all be\r\ncompounds? Their equivalents are multiples of the first: 1, 6, 8, 14,\r\n16. And is even hydrogen the most simple of the elements? Is not its\r\nmolecule composed of atoms, and may there not exist a single species of\r\nprimitive atom, whose geometric arrangement and various associations\r\nmight constitute the molecules of the so-called simple elements?\r\n\r\nIn our own solar system we discover the essential differences between\r\ncertain planets. In the spectrum of Jupiter, for instance, we are aware\r\nof the action of an unknown substance that manifests itself by a marked\r\nabsorption of certain red rays. This gas, which does not exist upon the\r\nEarth, is seen still more obviously in the atmospheres of Saturn and\r\nUranus. Indeed, upon this last planet the atmosphere appears, apart from\r\nits water vapor, to have no sort of analogy with our own. And in the\r\nsolar spectrum itself, many of the lines have not yet been identified\r\nwith terrestrial substances.\r\n\r\nThe interrelation of the planets is of course incontrovertible, since\r\nthey are all children of the same parent. But they differ among\r\nthemselves, not merely in respect of situation, position, volume, mass,\r\ndensity, temperature, atmosphere, but again in physical and chemical\r\nconstitution. And the point we would now accent is that this diversity\r\nshould not be regarded as an obstacle to the manifestations of life,\r\nbut, on the contrary, as a new field open to the infinite fecundity of\r\nthe universal mother.\r\n\r\nWhen our thoughts take wing, not only to our neighbors, Moon, Venus,\r\nMars, Jupiter, or Saturn, but still more toward the myriads of unknown\r\nworlds that gravitate round the suns disseminated in space, we have no\r\nplausible reason for imagining that the inhabitants of these other\r\nworlds of Heaven resemble us in any way, whether in form, or even in\r\norganic substance.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the terrestrial human body is due to the elements of\r\nour planet, and notably to carbon. The terrestrial human form derives\r\nfrom the ancestral animal forms to which it has gradually raised itself\r\nby the continuous progress of the transformation of species. To us it\r\nseems obvious that we are man or woman, because we have a head, a heart,\r\nlungs, two legs, two arms, and so on. Nothing is less a matter of\r\ncourse. That we are constituted as we are, is simply the result of our\r\npro-simian ancestors having also had a head, a heart, lungs, legs, and\r\narms--less elegant than your own, it is true, Madam, but still of the\r\nsame anatomy. And more and more, by the progress of paleontology, we are\r\ndelving down to the origin of beings. As certain as it is that the bird\r\nderives from the reptile by a process of organic evolution, so certain\r\nis it that terrestrial Humanity represents the topmost branches of the\r\nhuge genealogical tree, whereof all the limbs are brothers, and the\r\nroots of which are plunged into the very rudiments of the most\r\nelementary and primitive organisms.\r\n\r\nThe multitude of worlds is surely peopled by every imaginable and\r\nunimaginable form. Terrestrial man is endowed with five senses, or\r\nperhaps it is better to say six. Why should Nature stop at this point?\r\nWhy, for instance, may she not have given to certain beings an\r\nelectrical sense, a magnetic sense, a sense of orientation, an organ\r\nable to perceive the ethereal vibrations of the infra-red or\r\nultra-violet, or permitted them to hear at a distance, or to see through\r\nwalls? We eat and digest like coarse animals, we are slaves to our\r\ndigestive tube: may there not be worlds in which a nutritive atmosphere\r\nenables its fortunate inhabitants to dispense with this absurd process?\r\nThe least sparrow, even the dusky bat, has an advantage over us in that\r\nit can fly through the air. Think how inferior are our conditions, since\r\nthe man of greatest genius, the most exquisite woman, are nailed to the\r\nsoil like any vulgar caterpillar before its metamorphosis! Would it be a\r\ndisadvantage to inhabit a world in which we might fly whither we would;\r\na world of scented luxury, full of animated flowers; a world where the\r\nwinds would be incapable of exciting a tempest, where several suns of\r\ndifferent colors--the diamond glowing with the ruby, or the emerald with\r\nthe sapphire--would burn night and day (azure nights and scarlet days)\r\nin the glory of an eternal spring; with multi-colored moons sleeping in\r\nthe mirror of the waters, phosphorescent mountains, aerial\r\ninhabitants,--men, women, or perhaps of other sexes,--perfect in their\r\nforms, gifted with multiple sensibilities, luminous at will,\r\nincombustible as asbestos, perhaps immortal, unless they commit suicide\r\nout of curiosity? Lilliputian atoms as we are, let us once for all be\r\nconvinced that our imagination is but sterility, in the midst of an\r\ninfinitude hardly glimpsed by the telescope.\r\n\r\nOne important point seems always to be ignored expressly by those who\r\nblindly deny the doctrine of the plurality of worlds. It is that this\r\ndoctrine does not apply more particularly to the present epoch than to\r\nany other. _Our_ time is of no importance, no absolute value. Eternity\r\nis the field of the Eternal Sower. There is no reason why the other\r\nworlds should be inhabited _now_ more than at any other epoch.\r\n\r\nWhat, indeed, is the Present Moment? It is an open trap through which\r\nthe Future falls incessantly into the gulf of the Past.\r\n\r\nThe immensity of Heaven bears in its bosom cradles as well as tombs,\r\nworlds to come and perished worlds. It abounds in extinct suns, and\r\ncemeteries. In all probability Jupiter is not yet inhabited. What does\r\nthis prove? The Earth was not inhabited during its primordial period:\r\nwhat did that prove to the inhabitants of Mars or of the Moon, who were\r\nperhaps observing it at that epoch, a few million years ago?\r\n\r\nTo pretend that our globe must be the only inhabited world because the\r\nothers do not resemble it, is to reason, not like a philosopher, but, as\r\nwe remarked before, like a fish. Every rational fish ought to assume\r\nthat it is impossible to live out of water, since its outlook and its\r\nphilosophy do not extend beyond its daily life. There is no answer to\r\nthis order of reasoning, except to advise a little wider perception, and\r\nextension of the too narrow horizon of habitual ideas.\r\n\r\nFor us the resources of Nature may be considered infinite, and\r\n\"positive\" science, founded upon our senses only, is altogether\r\ninadequate, although it is the only possible basis of our reasoning. We\r\nmust learn to see with the eyes of our spirit.\r\n\r\nAs to the planetary systems other than our own, we are no longer reduced\r\nto hypotheses. We already know with certainty that our Sun is no\r\nexception, as was suggested, and is still maintained, by some theorists.\r\nThe discovery in itself is curious enough.\r\n\r\nIt is surely an exceptional situation that, given a sidereal system\r\ncomposed of a central sun, and of one or more stars gravitating round\r\nhim, the plane of such a system should fall just within our line of\r\nvision, and that it should revolve in such a way that the globes of\r\nwhich it is composed pass exactly between this sun and ourselves in\r\nturning round him, eclipsing him more or less during this transit. As,\r\non the other hand, the eclipses would be our only means of determining\r\nthe existence of these unknown planets (save indeed from perturbation,\r\nas in the case of Sirius and Procyon), it might have seemed quixotic to\r\nhope for like conditions in order to discover solar systems other than\r\nour own. But these exceptional circumstances have reproduced themselves\r\nat different parts of the Heavens.\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, we have seen that the variable star Algol owes its\r\nvariations in brilliancy, which reduce it from second to fourth\r\nmagnitude every sixty-nine hours, to the interposition of a body between\r\nitself and the Earth, and celestial mechanics has already been able to\r\ndetermine accurately the orbit of this body, its dimensions and its\r\nmass, and even the flattening of the sun Algol. Here, then, is a system\r\nin which we know the sun and an enormous planet, whose revolution is\r\neffected in sixty-nine hours with extreme rapidity, as measured by the\r\nspectroscope.\r\n\r\nThe star [delta] of Cepheus is in the same case: it is an orb eclipsed\r\nin a period of 129 hours, and its eclipsing planet also revolves in the\r\nplane of our vision. The variable star in Ophiuchus has an analogous\r\nsystem, and observation has already revealed a great number of others.\r\n\r\nSince, then, a certain number of solar systems differing from our own\r\nhave been revealed, as it were in section, to terrestrial observation,\r\nthis affords us sufficient evidence of the existence of an innumerable\r\nquantity of solar systems scattered through the immensities of space,\r\nand we are no longer reduced to conjecture.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, analysis of the motions of several stars, such as\r\nSirius, Procyon, Altaïr, proves that these distant orbs have\r\ncompanions,--planets not yet discovered by the telescope, and that\r\nperhaps never will be discovered, because they are obscure, and lost in\r\nthe radiation of the star.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome _savants_ have asserted that Life can not germinate if the\r\nconditions of the environment differ too much from terrestrial\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis is purely gratuitous, and we will now discuss it.\r\n\r\nIn order to examine what is happening on the Earth, let us mount the\r\nladder of time for a moment, to follow the evolutions of Nature.\r\n\r\nThere was an epoch when the Earth did not exist. Our planet, the future\r\nworld of our habitation, slept in the bosom of the solar nebula.\r\n\r\nAt last it came to birth, this cherished Earth, a gaseous, luminous\r\nball, poor reflection of the King of Orbs, its parent. Millions of years\r\nrolled by before the condensation and cooling of this new globe were\r\nsufficiently transformed to permit life to manifest itself in its most\r\nrudimentary aspects.\r\n\r\nThe first organic forms of the protoplasm, the first aggregations of\r\ncells, the protozoons, the zoophytes or plant-animals, the gelatinous\r\nmussels of the still warm seas, were succeeded by the fishes, then by\r\nthe reptiles, the birds, the mammals, and lastly man, who at present\r\noccupies the top of the genealogical tree, and crowns the animal\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nHumanity is comparatively young upon the Earth. We may attribute some\r\nthousands of centuries of existence to it ... and some five years of\r\nreason!\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial organisms, from the lowest up to man, are the resultant\r\nof the forces in action at the surface of our planet. The earliest seem\r\nto have been produced by the combinations of carbon with hydrogen and\r\nnitrogen; they were, so to speak, without animation, save for some very\r\nrudimentary sensibility; the sponges, corals, polyps, and medusæ, give\r\nus a notion of these primitive beings. They were formed in the tepid\r\nwaters of the primary epoch. As long as there were no continents, no\r\nislands emerging from the level of the universal ocean, there were no\r\nbeings breathing in the air. The first aquatic creatures were succeeded\r\nby the amphibia, the reptiles. Later on were developed the mammals and\r\nthe birds.\r\n\r\nWhat, again, do we not owe to the plant-world of the primary epoch, of\r\nthe secondary epoch, of the tertiary epoch, which slowly prepared the\r\ngood nutritious soil of to-day, in which the roses flourish, and the\r\npeach and strawberry ripen?\r\n\r\nBefore it gave birth to a Helen or a Cleopatra, life manifested itself\r\nunder the roughest forms, and in the most varied conditions. A\r\nlong-period comet passing in sight of the Earth from time to time would\r\nhave seen modifications of existence in each of its transits, in\r\naccordance with a slow evolution, corresponding to the variation of the\r\nconditions of existence, and progressing incessantly, for if Life is the\r\ngoal of nature, Progress is the supreme law.\r\n\r\nThe history of our planet is the history of life, with all its\r\nmetamorphoses. It is the same for all the worlds, with some exceptions\r\nof orbs arrested in their development.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of living beings is in absolute relation with the\r\nsubstances of which they are composed, the environment in which they\r\nmove, temperature, light, weight, density, the length of day and night,\r\nthe seasons, etc.--in a word, with all the cosmographic elements of a\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, we compare between themselves two worlds such as the\r\nEarth and Neptune, utterly different from the point of view of distance\r\nfrom the Sun, we could not for an instant suppose that organic\r\nstructures could have followed a parallel development on these planets.\r\nThe average temperature must be much lower on Neptune than on the Earth,\r\nand the same holds for intensity of light. The years and seasons there\r\nare 165 times longer than with us, the density of matter is three times\r\nas weak, and weight is, on the contrary, a little greater. Under\r\nconditions so different from our own, the activities of Nature would\r\nhave to translate themselves under other forms. And doubtless the\r\nelementary bodies would not be found there in the same proportions.\r\nConsequently we have to conclude that organs and senses would not be the\r\nsame there as here. The optic nerve, for instance, which has formed and\r\ndeveloped here from the rudimentary organ of the trilobite to the\r\nmarvels of the human eye, must be incomparably more sensitive upon\r\nNeptune than in our dazzling solar luminosity, in order to perceive\r\nradiations that we do not perceive here. In all probability, it is\r\nreplaced there by some other organ. The lungs, functioning there in\r\nanother atmosphere, are different from our own. So, too, for the stomach\r\nand digestive organs. Corporeal forms, animal and human, can not\r\nresemble those which exist upon the Earth.\r\n\r\nCertain _savants_ contend that if the conditions differed too much from\r\nterrestrial conditions, life could not be produced there at all. Yet we\r\nhave no right to limit the powers of Nature to the narrow bounds of our\r\nsphere of observation, and to pretend that our planet and our Humanity\r\nare the type of all the worlds. That is a hypothesis as ridiculous as it\r\nis childish.\r\n\r\nDo not let us be \"personal,\" like children, and old people who never see\r\nbeyond their room. Let us learn to live in the Infinite and the Eternal.\r\n\r\nFrom this larger point of view, the doctrine of the plurality of worlds\r\nis the complement and the natural crown of Astronomy. What interests us\r\nmost in the study of the Universe is surely to know what goes on there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese considerations show that, in all the ages, what really constitutes\r\na planet is not its skeleton but the life that vibrates upon its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nAnd again, if we analyze things, we see that for the Procession of\r\nNature, life is all, and matter nothing.\r\n\r\nWhat has become of our ancestors, the millions of human beings who\r\npreceded us upon this globe? Where are their bodies? What is left of\r\nthem? Search everywhere. Nothing is left but the molecules of air,\r\nwater, dust, atoms of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, etc., which\r\nare incorporated in turn in the organism of every living being.\r\n\r\nThe whole Earth is a vast cemetery, and its finest cities are rooted in\r\nthe catacombs. But now, in crossing Paris, I passed for at least the\r\nthousandth time near the Church of St. Germain-l'Auxerrois, and was\r\nobliged to turn out of the direct way, on account of excavations. I\r\nlooked down, and saw that immediately below the pavement, they had just\r\nuncovered some stone coffins still containing the skeletons that had\r\nreposed there for ten centuries. From time immemorial the passers-by had\r\ntrampled them unwittingly under foot. And I reflected that it is much\r\nthe same in every quarter of Paris. Only yesterday, some Roman tombs and\r\na coin with the effigy of Nero were found in a garden near the\r\nObservatory.\r\n\r\nAnd from the most general standpoint of Life, the whole world is in the\r\nsame case, and even more so, seeing that all that exists, all that\r\nlives, is formed of elements that have already been incorporated in\r\nother beings, no longer living. The roses that adorn the bosom of the\r\nfair ... but I will not enlarge upon this topic.\r\n\r\nAnd you, so strong and virile, of what elements is your splendid body\r\nformed? Where have the elements you absorb to-day in respiration and\r\nassimilation been drawn from, what lugubrious adventures have they been\r\nsubject to? Think away from it: do not insist on this point: on no\r\naccount consider it....\r\n\r\nAnd yet, let us dwell on it, since this reality is the most evident\r\ndemonstration of the ideal; since what exists is you, is all of us, is\r\n_Life_; and matter is only its substance, like the materials of a house,\r\nand even less so, since its particles only pass rapidly through the\r\nframework of our bodies. A heap of stones does not make a house.\r\nQuintillions of tons of materials would not represent the Earth or any\r\nother world.\r\n\r\nYes, what really exists, what constitutes a complete orb, is the city of\r\nLife. Let us recognize that the flower of life flourishes on the surface\r\nof our planet, embellishing it with its perfume; that it is just this\r\nlife that we see and admire,--of which we form part,--and which is the\r\n_raison d'être_ of things; that matter floats, and crosses, and crosses\r\nback again, in the web of living beings,--and the reality, the goal, is\r\nnot matter--it is the life matter is employed upon.\r\n\r\nYes, matter passes, and being also, after sharing in the concerted\r\nsymphony of life.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed everything passes rapidly!\r\n\r\nWhat irrepressible grief, what deep melancholy, what ineffaceable\r\nregrets we feel, when as age comes on we look back, when we see our\r\nfriends fallen upon the road one after the other, above all when we\r\nvisit the beloved scenes of our childhood, those homes of other years,\r\nthat witnessed our first start in terrestrial existence, our first\r\ngames, our first affections--those affections of childhood that seemed\r\neternal--when we wander over those fields and valleys and hills, when\r\nwe see again the landscape whose aspect has hardly changed, and whose\r\nimage is so intimately linked with our first impressions. There near\r\nthis fireside the grandfather danced us on his knee, and told us\r\nblood-curdling stories; here the kind grandmother came to see if we were\r\ncomfortably tucked in, and not likely to fall out of the big bed; in\r\nthis little wood, along these alleys that seemed endless, we spread our\r\nnets for birds; in this stream we fished for crayfish; there on the path\r\nwe played at soldiers with our elders, who were always captains; on\r\nthese slopes we found rare stones and fossils, and mysterious\r\npetrifactions; on this hill we admired the fine sunsets, the appearance\r\nof the stars, the form of the constellations. There we began to live, to\r\nthink, to love, to form attachments, to dream, to question every\r\nproblem, to breathe intellectually and physically. And now, where is\r\nthis beloved grandfather? the good grandmother? where are all whom we\r\nknew in infancy? where are our dreams of childhood? Winged thoughts\r\nstill seem to flutter in the air, and that is all. People, caresses,\r\nvoices, all have gone and vanished. The cemetery has closed over them\r\nall. There is a silent void. Were all those fine and sunny hours an\r\nillusion? Was it only to weep one day over this negation that our\r\nchildish hearts were so tenderly attached to these fleeting shadows? Is\r\nthere nothing, down the long length of human history, but eternal\r\ndelusion?\r\n\r\nIt is here, above all, that we find ourselves in presence of the\r\ngreatest problems. Life is the goal, it is Life that produces the\r\nconditions of Thought. Without Thought, where would be the Universe?\r\n\r\nWe feel that without life and thought, the Universe would be an empty\r\ntheater, and Astronomy itself, sublime science, a vain research. We feel\r\nthat this is the truth, veiled as yet to actual science, and that human\r\nraces kindred with our own exist there in the immensities of space. Yes,\r\nwe _feel_ that this is truth.\r\n\r\nBut we would fain go a little further in our knowledge of the universe,\r\nand penetrate in some measure the secret of our destinies. We would know\r\nif these distant and unknown Humanities are not attached to us by\r\nmysterious cords, if our life, which will assuredly be extinguished at\r\nsome definite moment here below, will not be prolonged into the regions\r\nof Eternity.\r\n\r\nA moment ago we said that nothing is left of the body. Millions of\r\norganisms have lived, there are no remains of them. Air, water, smoke,\r\ndust. _Memento, homo, quia pulvis es et in pulverem revertebis._\r\nRemember oh man! that dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return,\r\nsays the priest to the faithful, when he scatters the ashes on the day\r\nafter the carnival.\r\n\r\nThe body disappears entirely. It goes where the corpse of Cæsar went an\r\nhour after the extinction of his pyre. Nor will there be more remains of\r\nany of us. And the whole of Humanity, and the Earth itself, will also\r\ndisappear one day. Let no one talk of the Progress of Humanity as an\r\nend! That would be too gross a decoy.\r\n\r\nIf the soul were also to disappear in smoke, what would be left of the\r\nvital and intellectual organization of the world? Nothing.\r\n\r\nOn this hypothesis, _all_ would be reduced to _nothing_.\r\n\r\nOur reason is not immense, our terrestrial faculties are sufficiently\r\nlimited, but this reason and these faculties suffice none the less to\r\nmake us feel the improbability, the absurdity, of this hypothesis, and\r\nwe reject it as incompatible with the sublime grandeur of the spectacle\r\nof the universe.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, Creation does not seem to concern itself with us. It\r\nproceeds on its inexorable course without consulting our sensations.\r\nWith the poet we regret the implacable serenity of Nature, opposing the\r\nirony of its smiling splendor to our mourning, our revolts, and our\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n          Que peu de temps suffit pour changer toutes choses!\r\n            Nature au front serein, comme vous oubliez!\r\n          Et comme vous brisez dans vos métamorphoses\r\n            Les fils mystérieux où nos coeurs sont liés.\r\n\r\n          D'autres vont maintenant passer où nous passâmes;\r\n            Nous y sommes venus, d'autres vont y venir,\r\n          Et le songe qu'avaient ébauché nos deux âmes,\r\n            Ils le continueront sans pouvoir le finir.\r\n\r\n          Car personne ici-bas ne termine et n'acheve;\r\n            Les pires des humains sont comme les meilleurs;\r\n          Nous nous éveillons tous au même endroit du rêve:\r\n            Tout commence en ce monde et tout finit ailleurs.\r\n\r\n          Répondez, vallon pur, répondez, solitude!\r\n            O Nature, abritée en ce désert si beau,\r\n          Quand nous serons couchés tous deux, dans l'attitude\r\n            Que donne aux morts pensifs la forme du tombeau,\r\n\r\n          Est-ce que vous serez à ce point insensible,\r\n            De nous savoir perdus, morts avec nos amours,\r\n          Et de continuer votre fête paisible\r\n            Et de toujours sourire et de chanter toujours?[16]\r\n\r\n_Note.--Free Translation._\r\n\r\n     How brief a time suffices for all things to change! Serene-fronted\r\n     Nature, too soon you will forget!... in your metamorphoses\r\n     ruthlessly snapping the cords that bind our hearts together!\r\n\r\n     Others will pass where we pass; we have arrived, and others will\r\n     arrive after us: the thought sketched out by our souls will be\r\n     pursued by theirs ... and they will not find the solution of it.\r\n\r\n     For no one here begins or finishes: the worst are as the best of\r\n     humans; we all awake at the same moment of the dream: we all begin\r\n     in this world, and end otherwhere.\r\n\r\n     Reply, sweet valley, reply, solitude; O Nature, sheltering in this\r\n     splendid desert, when we are both asleep, and cast by the tomb into\r\n     the attitude of pensive death.\r\n\r\n     Will you to the last verge be so insensible, that, knowing us lost,\r\n     and dead with our loves, you will pursue your cheerful feast, and\r\n     smile, and sing always?\r\n\r\nYes, mortals may say that when they are sleeping in the grave, spring\r\nand summer will still smile and sing; husband and wife may ask\r\nthemselves if they will meet again some day, in another sphere; but do\r\nwe not _feel_ that our destinies can not be terminated here, and that\r\nshort of absolute and final nonentity for everything, they must be\r\nrenewed beyond, in that starry Heaven to which every dream has flown\r\ninstinctively since the first origins of Humanity?\r\n\r\nAs our planet is only a province of the Infinite Heavens, so our actual\r\nexistence is only a stage in Eternal Life. Astronomy, by giving us\r\nwings, conducts us to the sanctuary of truth. The specter of death has\r\ndeparted from our Heaven. The beams of every star shed a ray of hope\r\ninto our hearts. On each sphere Nature chants the pæan of Life Eternal.\r\n\r\n  THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Aberration, 300\r\n\r\n  Adams, 168\r\n\r\n  Agnesi, Marie, 5\r\n\r\n  Alcar,

FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The French edition of this book is entitled Astronomy for\r\nWomen.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[2] 1 kilometer = 0.6214 mile; 100 kilometers may be taken as 62 miles.\r\n1 kilogram is about 2.2 lb.; 5 kilograms = 11 lb.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[3] It is useful to know the letters of the Greek Alphabet. They are\r\neasily learned, as follows:\r\n\r\n          [alpha] Alpha\r\n          [beta] Beta\r\n          [gamma] Gamma\r\n          [delta] Delta\r\n          [epsilon] Epsilon\r\n          [zeta] Zeta\r\n          [eta] Eta\r\n          [theta] Theta\r\n          [iota] Iota\r\n          [kappa] Kappa\r\n          [lambda] Lambda\r\n          [mu] Mu\r\n          [nu] Nu\r\n          [xi] Xi\r\n          [omicron] Omicron\r\n          [pi] Pi\r\n          [rho] Rho\r\n          [sigma] or [sigma] Sigma\r\n          [tau] Tau\r\n          [upsilon] Upsilon\r\n          [phi] Phi\r\n          [chi] Chi\r\n          [psi] Psi\r\n          [omega] Omega\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] All the stars visible at any hour during the year can easily be\r\nfound with the help of the author's Planisphere mobile.\r\n\r\n[5] Let it be remarked in passing that the stars might be much farther\r\noff than they are, and invisible to our eyes; the Heavens would then\r\nassume the aspect of an absolutely empty space, the moon and planets\r\nalone remaining.\r\n\r\n[6] 14\" = 14 seconds of arc. One second of the circle is an exceedingly\r\nminute quantity. It is 1 millimeter seen at a distance of 206 meters.\r\nOne millimeter seen at a distance of 20 m. 62 = 10 secs. These values\r\nare invisible to the unaided eye.\r\n\r\n[7] These fine double stars can be observed with the help of the\r\nsmallest telescope.\r\n\r\n[8] For the explanation of the angular distances of degrees, minutes,\r\nand seconds, see Chapter XI, on Methods of Measurement.\r\n\r\n[9] The author has endeavored on the plates to represent the aspect of\r\nthe Earth in the starry sky of Mercury, Venus, and Mars; but in all\r\nrepresentations of this kind the stars are necessarily made too large.\r\nBy calculation the diameters of the Earth and Moon as seen from the\r\nplanets, and their distances, are as follows:\r\n\r\n                            Diameter of    Diameter of     Distance\r\n                             the Earth.      the Moon.    Earth-Moon.\r\n\r\n  Of Mercury (opposition)       20\"             8\"            871\"\r\n  Of Venus (opposition)         64\"            17\"          1,928\"\r\n  Of Mars (quadrature)          15\"             4\"            464\"\r\n  Of Jupiter (quadrature)      3.5\"           0.1\"            105\"\r\n\r\nThese aspects will be appreciated if we remember that the distance of\r\nthe components of [epsilon] Lyre = 207\", that of Atlas in Pleione =\r\n301\", and that of the stars Mizar and Alcor = 708\".\r\n\r\n[10] A few evenings ago, after observing Venus in the calm and silent\r\nHeavens at the close of day, my eyes fell upon a drawing sent me by my\r\nfriend Gustave Dore, which is included in the illustrations of his\r\nwonderful edition of Dante's Divina Commedia. This drawing seems to be\r\nin place here, and I offer my readers a poor reproduction of it, taken\r\nfrom the fine engraving in the book. Dante and Virgil, in the peaceful\r\nevening, are contemplating _lo bel pianeta ch'ad amar conforta_ (the\r\nbeautiful planet that incites to love).\r\n\r\n[11] Strictly speaking, 1 kilometer = 0.6214 mile. Here, as throughout,\r\nthe equivalents are only given in round numbers.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[12] Translator: Compare the well-known English rhyme:\r\n\r\n          Thirty days hath September,\r\n          April, June, and November.\r\n          While all the rest have thirty-one,\r\n          Excepting February alone,\r\n          In which but twenty-eight appear\r\n          And twenty-nine when comes Leap Year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[13] Fifty-eight different pictures of the aspect of the Moon to the\r\nunaided eye will be found in the Monthly Bulletins of the Astronomical\r\nSociety of France, for the year 1900, in pursuance of an investigation\r\nmade by the author among the different members of the Society.\r\n\r\n[14] My readers are charged not to speak of this property (which is\r\nfairly extensive), lest the Budget Commission, at the end of its\r\nresources, should be tempted to put on an unexpected tax. This ring,\r\nwhich the astronomers presented to me in the year 1887, is almost in the\r\ncenter of the lunar disk, to the north of Ptolemy and Herschel.\r\n\r\n[15] \"La fin du Monde.\" Flammarion, p. 186.\r\n\r\n[16] Victor Hugo. _Tristesse d'Olympia._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Astronomy for Amateurs, by Camille Flammarion",
