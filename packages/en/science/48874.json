The gratification\r\nhas come especially because of the opportunity thus afforded of\r\nrevision, improvement in style, and correction of the many inaccuracies\r\nwhich the first edition contained, excusable only by the manner in which\r\n(as explained in the preface of the first edition) the volume had come\r\ninto existence.\r\n\r\nOnly in a few cases has it seemed desirable to expand, since the object\r\nof the book is not to be complete, but to give as briefly as possible an\r\noversight over a rather large field. The chapter on France has, however,\r\nbeen entirely re-written and considerably enlarged to meet the just\r\ncriticisms of reviewers; the excellent work of Huffel, full of\r\nhistorical data, which was not available when the first edition was\r\nprinted, permitting a clearer and fuller statement to be made.\r\n\r\nAs long as history is in the making, a book of this kind can hardly be\r\nbrought up to date. This should especially be kept in mind by the reader\r\nin regard to the statistics brought in. Since these are only to serve in\r\ngeneral to show the magnitude of the interests involved, they may\r\nwithout damage be only approximately accurate, and even of older date.\r\n\r\nSome of the chapters have been submitted for criticism and corrections\r\nto correspondents in the various countries to which they refer. For the\r\nkindly assistance of these friends thanks is due from the author.\r\n\r\n  TORONTO, OCTOBER, 1911.\r\n\r\n  B. E. FERNOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis publication is the result of a series of 25 lectures which the\r\nwriter was invited to deliver before the students of forestry in Yale\r\nUniversity as a part of their regular course of instruction during the\r\nsession of 1904.\r\n\r\nCircumstances made it desirable, in the absence of any existing\r\ntextbooks on the subject, to print at once, for the sake of ready\r\nreference, the substance of the lectures while they were being\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nThis statement of the manner in which the book came into existence will\r\nexplain and, it is hoped, excuse the crudities of style, which has been\r\nalso hampered by the necessity of condensation.\r\n\r\nThe main object was to bring together the information, now scattered and\r\nmostly inaccessible to English or American readers: the style has been\r\nsacrificed to brevity; it is a book of expanded lecture notes.\r\n\r\nIn the nature of the case the book does not lay claim to any originality\r\nexcept in the manner of presentation, being merely a compilation of\r\nfacts gathered mostly from other compilations, official documents and\r\njournals.\r\n\r\nFor none of the countries discussed does a complete work on the history\r\nof forests and forestry exist, excepting in the case of Germany, which\r\ncan boast of a number of comprehensive works on the subject. It was,\r\ntherefore, possible to treat that country more _in extenso_. Moreover,\r\nit appeared desirable to enlarge upon the history of that country, since\r\nit is pre-eminently in the lead in forestry matters and has passed\r\nthrough all the stages of development of forest policies and forestry\r\npractice, which, with more or less variations must be repeated in other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nEspecially the growth of the technical science and art of forestry,\r\nwhich has been developed in Germany for a longer time and to a more\r\nrefined degree than in other countries, has been elaborated in the\r\nchapter relating to that country.\r\n\r\nFor some of the other countries available sources of information were\r\nquite limited. The writer believes, however, that for the purpose of\r\nthis brief statement the data collected will be found sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn order to make conditions existing in the different countries and\r\ntheir causes more readily understood it appeared desirable to give very\r\nbrief historic references to their political and economic development\r\nand also brief statements of their general physical conditions.\r\n\r\nPresent conditions of forest policy and forest administration have\r\nsometimes been enlarged upon beyond the requirements of historical\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n  ITHACA, N.Y., May, 1907.\r\n\r\n  B. E. FERNOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe value of studying the historical development of an economic subject\r\nor of a technical art which, like forestry, relies to a large extent\r\nupon empiricism, lies in the fact that it brings before us, in proper\r\nperspective, accumulated experience, and enables us to analyze cause and\r\neffect, whereby we may learn to appreciate the reasons for present\r\nconditions and the possibilities for rational advancement.\r\n\r\nIf there be one philosophy more readily derivable than another from the\r\nstudy of the history of forestry it is that history repeats itself. The\r\nsame policies and the same methods which we hear propounded to-day have\r\nat some other time been propounded and tried elsewhere: we can study the\r\nresults, broadening our judgment and thereby avoid the mistakes of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nNowhere is the record of experience and the historic method of study of\r\nmore value than in an empiric art like forestry, in which it takes\r\ndecades, a lifetime, nay a century to see the final effects of\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nSuch study, if properly pursued, tends to free the mind from many\r\nfoolish prejudices and particularly from an unreasonable partiality for\r\nour own country and its customs and methods merely because they are our\r\nown, substituting the proper patriotism, which applies the best\r\nknowledge, wherever found, to our own necessities.\r\n\r\nForestry is an art born of necessity, as opposed to arts of convenience\r\nand of pleasure. Only when a reduction in the natural supplies of forest\r\nproducts under the demands of civilization, necessitates a husbanding of\r\nsupplies or necessitates the application of art or skill or knowledge in\r\nsecuring a reproduction, or when unfavorable conditions of soil or\r\nclimate induced by forest destruction make themselves felt does the art\r\nof forestry make its appearance. Hence its beginnings occur in different\r\nplaces at different times and its development proceeds at different\r\npaces.\r\n\r\nIn the one country, owing to economic development, the need of an\r\nintensive forest management and of strict forest policies may have\r\narrived, while in another, rough exploitation and wasteful practices are\r\nstill natural and practically unavoidable. And such differences, as we\r\nshall see, may even exist in the different parts of the same country.\r\n\r\nThe origin and growth of the art, then, is dependent on economic and\r\ncultural conditions, on various economic development and on elements of\r\nenvironment. The development of the art can only be understood and\r\nappreciated through the knowledge of such environment, of such other\r\ndevelopments as of agriculture, of industries, of means of\r\ntransportation, of civilization generally.\r\n\r\nHence we find, for instance, that England, located so as to be\r\naccessible by sea from all points of the compass and with oceanic\r\nshipping well developed, can apparently dispense with serious\r\nconsideration of the forest supply question.\r\n\r\nAgain, we find that more than a century ago fear of a timber famine\r\nagitated not only the dense populations of many European countries, but\r\neven the scanty population of the United States, in spite of the natural\r\nforest wealth which is still supplying us; and not without good reason,\r\nfor at that time wood was the only fuel and rivers the only means of\r\ntransportation; hence local scarcity was to be feared and was not\r\nunfrequently experienced when accessible forest areas had been\r\nexploited. Railroad and canal development and the use of coal for fuel\r\nchanged this condition on both continents. Now, with improved means of\r\ntransportation by land and by sea, the questions of wood supply and of\r\nforestry development, which at one time were of very local concern, have\r\nbecome world questions, and he who proposes to discuss intelligently\r\nforest conditions and forestry movement in one country must understand\r\nwhat is going on in other countries.\r\n\r\nAs will appear from the study of the following pages, with the exception\r\nof some parts of central Europe or of some sporadic attempts elsewhere\r\nto regulate forest use, the development of the forestry idea belongs\r\nessentially to the 19th century, and more especially to the second half,\r\nwhen the rapid development of railroads had narrowed the world, and the\r\nremarkable development of industries and material civilization called\r\nfor increased draft on forest resources.\r\n\r\nYet we are still largely ignorant as to the extent of available forest\r\narea, not only in this country but elsewhere: we do not know whether it\r\nbe sufficient in extent and yield to furnish a continuous supply for\r\nthe needs of our civilization, or, if not, for how long a time it will\r\nsuffice. We can only make very broad statements as to questions of wood\r\nsupply, and very broad inferences from them as argument for the need of\r\na closer study of forest conditions and of the practice of forestry:\r\n\r\n1. Practically, the northern temperate zone alone produces the kinds of\r\nwood which enter most largely into our economy, namely the soft conifers\r\nand the medium hard woods; most of the woods of the tropics are very\r\nhard, fit primarily for ornamental use and hence less necessary.\r\nPossibly a change in the methods of the use of wood may also change the\r\nrelative economic values, but at present the vast forests of the\r\ntropical countries are of relatively little importance in the discussion\r\nof wood supply for the world.\r\n\r\n2. The productive forest area, of the temperate zone, in which the\r\nindustrial nations are located, has continuously decreased. We shall not\r\nbe far from wrong in stating this area liberally, to be at present\r\naround 2,500 million acres,[1] namely in Europe, 800 million acres; in\r\nAsia, 800 million acres; in North America, 900 million acres. How much\r\nof this acreage contains available virgin timber, how much is merely\r\npotential forest, how much growing crop, it is impossible to state.\r\n\r\n  [1] The total forest area of the world is supposed to be 3,800\r\n  million acres.\r\n\r\n3. The civilized wood consuming population of this territory is about\r\n500 million, hence the per capita acreage is still 5 acres. Taking the\r\nEuropean countries which now have to import all or part of their\r\nconsumption (excess over exports), we find that their population is\r\nestimated at 180 million and that they use 30 cubic feet of wood per\r\ncapita, of which 12 cubic feet is log timber; or altogether they use\r\n2,200 million cubic feet of this latter description, of which they\r\nimport in round numbers 1,000 million at a cost of about 250 million\r\ndollars; their forest acreage of 100 million acres being insufficient to\r\nproduce, even under careful management as in Germany, more than\r\ntwo-thirds of their needs. And the wood consumption in all these nations\r\nis growing at the rate of 1½ to 2 per cent. annually.\r\n\r\n4. The deficiency is at present supplied by the export countries,\r\nRussia, Sweden, Norway, Austria-Hungary, Canada and United States, and\r\nthese countries themselves also increasing their consumption, are\r\nbeginning to feel the drain on their forest resources, which are for the\r\nmost part merely roughly exploited.\r\n\r\n5. If we assume a log timber requirement by the 500 million people of\r\n6000 million cubic feet and could secure what France annually produces,\r\nnamely a little less than 9 cubic feet of such timber per acre, the area\r\nsupposed to be under forest would amply suffice. But a large part of it\r\nis in fact withdrawn from _useful_ production and of the balance not\r\nmore than 250 million acres at best are as yet under management for\r\ncontinuous production. Hence attention to forestry is an urgent\r\nnecessity for every industrial nation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe history of the forest in all forest countries shows the same periods\r\nof development.\r\n\r\nFirst hardly recognized as of value or even as personal property, the\r\nforest appears an undesirable encumbrance of the soil, and the attitude\r\nof the settler is of necessity inimical to the forest: the need for farm\r\nand pasture leads to forest destruction.\r\n\r\nThe next stage is that of restriction in forest use and protection\r\nagainst cattle and fire, the stage of conservative lumbering. Then come\r\npositive efforts to secure re-growth by fostering natural regeneration\r\nor by artificial planting: the practice of silviculture begins. Finally\r\na management for continuity--organizing existing forest areas for\r\nsustained yield--forest economy is introduced.\r\n\r\nThat the time and progress of these stages of development and the\r\nmethods of their inauguration vary in different parts of the world is\r\nreadily understood from the intimate relation which, as has been pointed\r\nout, this economic subject bears to all other economic as well as\r\npolitical developments.\r\n\r\nAt the present time we find all the European nations practicing\r\nforestry, although with a very varying degree of intensity. The greatest\r\nand most universal development of the art is for good reasons to be\r\nfound in Germany and its nearest neighbors. Early attention to forest\r\nconservancy was here induced by density of population, which enforces\r\nintensity in the use of soil, and by the comparative difficulty of\r\nsecuring wood supplies cheaply enough from outside. On the other hand,\r\nsuch countries as the Mediterranean peninsulas by their advantageous\r\nsituation with reference to importations, with their mild climate and\r\nless intensive industrial development, have felt this need less.\r\n\r\nAgain, the still poorly settled and originally heavily timbered\r\ncountries of the Scandinavian peninsula and the vast empire of Russia\r\nare still heavy exploiters of forest products and are only just\r\nbeginning to feel the drain on their forest resources; while the United\r\nStates, with as much forest wealth as Russia, but with a much more\r\nintensive industrial development, has managed to reach the stage of need\r\nfor a conservative forest policy in a shorter time.\r\n\r\nFrom each of the European countries we learn something helpful towards\r\ninaugurating such policies, and while, owing to a different historical\r\nbackground and to different political and social conditions, none of\r\ntheir administrative methods and measures may appeal to us, the\r\nprinciples underlying them as well as those underlying their\r\nsilvicultural methods remain the same; they are applicable everywhere,\r\nand can best be recognized and studied in the history of their\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST OF THE ANCIENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Waldgeschichte des Alterthums_, by AUGUST SEIDENSTICKER, 1886, 2\r\n  vols., pp. 863, is a most painstaking compilation from original\r\n  sources of notes regarding the forest conditions and the knowledge\r\n  of trees, forests and forestry among the ancients. Contains also a\r\n  full bibliography.\r\n\r\n  _Die Waldwirthschaft der Rœmer_, by J. TRURIG, collects the\r\n  knowledge, especially of arboriculture and silviculture, possessed\r\n  by the Romans.\r\n\r\n  _Forstwissenschaftliche Leistungen der Altgriechen_, by Dr. CHLOROS,\r\n  in Forstwissenschaftliches Centralblatt, 1885, pp. 8.\r\n\r\n  _Archeologia forestale, Dell’ antica storia e giurisprudenza\r\n  forestale in Italia_, by A. DI BERENGER, 1859.\r\n\r\nThe forest was undoubtedly the earliest home of mankind, its edible\r\nproducts forming its principal value. Its wild animals developed the\r\nhunter, the chase first furnishing means of subsistence and then\r\nexhilaration and pleasure. Next, it was the mast and, in its openings,\r\nthe pasture which gave to the forest its value for the herder, and only\r\nlast, with the development into settled communities and more highly\r\ncivilized conditions of life, did the wood product become its main\r\ncontribution toward that civilization. Finally, in the refinement of\r\ncultural conditions in densely settled countries is added its influence\r\non soil, climate and water conditions.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no written history, there is little doubt that these\r\nwere the phases in the appreciation of woodlands in the earliest\r\ndevelopment of mankind, for we find the same phases repeated in our own\r\ntimes in all newly settled countries.\r\n\r\nAs agriculture develops, the need for farming ground overshadows the\r\nusefulness of the forest in all these directions, and it is cleared\r\naway; moreover, as population remains scanty, a wasteful use of its\r\nstores forms the rule, until necessity arises for greater care in the\r\nexploitation, for more rational distribution of farm and forest area,\r\nand finally for intentional reproduction of wood as a useful crop.\r\n\r\nCorrespondingly forest conditions change from the densely forested hills\r\nand mountain slopes during the age of the nomad and hunter to the\r\n“enclaves” or patches of field and pasture enclosed by the forest of the\r\nfirst farmers, then follows the opening up of the valleys and lowlands,\r\nwhile the hill and mountain farms may return to forest, and finally,\r\nwith the increase of population and civilization in valleys and plains,\r\na reduction of the forest area and a decrease of forest wealth results.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Forest Conditions._\r\n\r\nWhile we have many isolated references to forest conditions and progress\r\nof forest exploitation among the ancients in the writings of poets and\r\nhistorians, these are generally too brief to permit us to gain a very\r\nclear picture of the progress of forest history; except in isolated\r\ncases, they furnish only glimpses, allowing us to fill in the rest to\r\nsome extent by guess.\r\n\r\nThat the countries occupied and known to the ancients, even Spain and\r\nPalestine, were originally well-wooded there seems little doubt,\r\nalthough in the drier regions and on the drier limestone soils, the\r\nforest was perhaps open, as is usual under such conditions, and truly\r\narid, forestless regions were also found where they exist now. Although\r\nit has been customary to point out some of the Mediterranean and\r\nEastern countries as having become deserts and depopulated through\r\ndeforestation, and although this is undoubtedly true for some parts, as\r\nMount Lebanon and Syria, generalization in this respect is dangerous.\r\n\r\nWe know, however, that by the 11th century before Christ, in Palestine,\r\nAsia Minor and Greece, especially in the neighborhood of thriving\r\ncities, the forest cover had vanished to a large extent and building\r\ntimber for the temples at Tyre and Sidon had to be brought long\r\ndistances from Mount Lebanon, whose wealth of cedar was also freely\r\ndrawn upon for ship timber and other structures. Although about 465 B.C.\r\nArtaxerxes I, having recognized the pending exhaustion of this mountain\r\nforest, had attempted to regulate the cutting of timber, the\r\nexploitation had by 333 B.C. progressed to such an extent that\r\nAlexander the Great found at least the south slope exhausted and almost\r\nwoodless.\r\n\r\nThe destruction by axe and fire of the celebrated forests of Sharon,\r\nCarmel and Bashan is the theme of the prophet Isaiah writing about 590\r\nB.C.; and the widespread devastation of large forest areas during the\r\nJewish wars is depicted by Josephus. In Greece, the Persian wars are on\r\nrecord as causes of widespread forest destruction. Yet in other parts,\r\nas on the island of Cyprus, which, originally densely wooded, had\r\nrapidly lost its forest wealth during Cleopatra’s time through the\r\ndevelopment of mining and metallurgical works, ship building and\r\nclearing for farms, the kings seemed to have been able to protect the\r\nremnants for a long time, so that respectable forest cover exists even\r\nto date.\r\n\r\nThe Romans seem to have had still a surplus of ship timber at their\r\ncommand in the third and second centuries before Christ, when they did\r\nnot hesitate to burn the warships of the Carthaginians (203 B.C.) and of\r\nthe Syrians (189 B.C.), although it may be that other considerations\r\nforced these actions. Denuded hills and scarcity of building timber in\r\ncertain parts are mentioned at the end of the third century before\r\nChrist, and that the need for conservative use of timber resources had\r\narrived also appears from the fact that when (167 B.C.) the Romans had\r\nbrought Macedonia under their sway, the cutting of ship timber in the\r\nextensive forests of that country was prohibited. Although at that time\r\nthe Roman State forests were still quite extensive, it is evident that\r\nunder the system of renting these for the mast and pasture and for the\r\nexploitation of their timber to companies of contractors, their\r\ndevastation must have progressed rapidly. Yet, on the whole, with local\r\nexceptions, Italy remained well wooded until the Christian era.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, according to Diodorus Siculus (about 100 B.C.), the Southern\r\nprovinces were densely wooded when about 200 B.C. the Romans first took\r\npossession; but soon after a great forest fire starting from the\r\nPyrenees ran over the country, exposing deposits of silver ore, which\r\ninvited a large influx of miners, the cause of reckless deforestation of\r\nthe country. The interior of this peninsula, however, was probably\r\nalways forestless or at least scantily wooded.\r\n\r\nWhile through colonization, exploitation, fire and other abuse, the\r\nuseful forest area was decimated in many parts, the location of the\r\nMediterranean peninsular countries was such that wood supplies could be\r\nreadily secured by water from distant parts, and the _lignarii_ or wood\r\nmerchants of Italy drew their supplies even from India by way of\r\nAlexandria; they went for Ash to Asia Minor; for Cedar to Cilicia;\r\nPaphlagonia, Liguria and Mauritania became the great wood export\r\ncountries. It is interesting to note that a regular wood market existed\r\nin Rome, as in Jerusalem, and at the former place firewood was sold by\r\nthe pound (75c per 200 lbs., in Cicero’s time). At the same time that\r\nthe causes of devastation were at work the forest area also increased in\r\nsome parts, recovering ground lost during wars and through the neglect\r\nof farms by natural seeding; much less by active effort, although\r\nplanting of trees in parks, vineyards and groves was early practiced to\r\na limited extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Development of Property._\r\n\r\nAs to development of forest property we have also only fragmentary\r\ninformation. Nomads do not know soil as property. When they become\r\nsettled farmers the plowland, the vineyard or olive grove and orchard\r\nare recognized as private property, but all the rest remains common\r\nproperty or nobody’s in particular; and even the private property was\r\nnot at first entirely exclusive. Hence for a long time (and in some\r\nparts even to date) the exclusive property right in forests is not fully\r\nestablished. At least the right to hunt over all territory without\r\nrestriction was possessed by everybody, although an owner might prevent\r\nundesirable hunters from entering his property if it was enclosed. The\r\nsetting aside of hunting grounds for private use came into existence\r\nonly in later Roman times. But woodland parks, planted or otherwise,\r\nlike the “paradises” of the Persian kings and the _nemora_ of the Romans\r\nand Carthaginians were early a part of the private property of princes\r\nand grandees from which others were excluded.\r\n\r\nForests formed a barrier and defense against outsiders, or a hiding\r\nplace in case of need, hence we find in early times frontier forests, or\r\nas the Germans called them “Grenzmarken,” set aside or designated for\r\nsuch purposes and withdrawn from use, and sometimes additionally\r\nfortified by ditches and other artificial barriers. Even before the\r\n“Grenzmarken” of the Germans the forest was used by Greeks, Romans and\r\nstill earlier among Asiatic tribes to designate the limit of peoples as\r\nwell as to serve as a bulwark against attacks from invaders.\r\n\r\nAgain, the pantheistic ideas of the ancients led to consecrating not\r\nonly trees but groves to certain gods: holy groves were frequent among\r\nthe Greeks and Romans, and also among other pagans; the Jews, however,\r\nwere enjoined to eradicate these emblems of paganism in the promised\r\nland with axe and fire, and they did so more or less, removal and\r\nre-establishment of holy groves varying according to the religious\r\nsentiment of their rulers. Altogether, in Palestine the forests were\r\nleft to the free and unrestricted use of the Israelites.\r\n\r\nOut of religious conceptions and priestly shrewdness arose church\r\nproperty in farms and forests among the Indian Brahmans, the Ethiopians\r\nand Egyptians, as also among Greeks and Romans.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the oriental kings were exclusive owners of all\r\nunappropriated or public forests. This was certainly the case with the\r\nprinces of India and of Persia, and such ownership can be proved\r\ndefinitely in many other parts, as in the case of the forests of\r\nLebanon, of Cyprus, and of various forest areas in Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nThat in the Greek republics the forests were mainly public property\r\nseems to be likely; for Attica, at least, this is true without doubt.\r\n\r\nWhile the first Roman kings seem to have owned royal domains, which were\r\ndistributed among the people after the expulsion of the kings, the\r\npublic property which came to the republic as a result of conquest was\r\nin most cases at once transferred to private hands, either for\r\nhomesteads of colonists, or in recognition of services of soldiers and\r\nother public officers, or to mollify the conquered, or by sale, or for\r\nrent, not to mention the rights acquired by squatters. The rents were\r\nusually farmed out to collectors (_publicani_) or to corporations formed\r\nof these. Livy, however, mentions also State forests in which the\r\ncutting was regulated, probably by merely reserving the ship timber.\r\n\r\nThat occasionally single cities and other smaller municipal units owned\r\nforest properties in common seems also established.\r\n\r\nPrivate forest properties connected with farm estates existed in\r\nEthiopia, in Arabia, among the Greeks and among the Romans at home as\r\nwell as in their colonies. Especially pasture woods (_saltus_) connected\r\nwith small and large estates (_latifundia_) into which probably most\r\nforest areas near settlements were turned, are frequently mentioned as\r\nin private ownership; but also other private forests existed.\r\n\r\nThe institution of servitudes or rights of user (_usus_ and\r\n_usus-fructus_) and a considerable amount of law regarding the\r\nconditions under which they were exercised and regarding their\r\nextinguishment were in existence among the Romans in the first centuries\r\nof the Christian era.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Forest Use._\r\n\r\nRestrictions in the use of woods were not entirely absent, but with the\r\nexception of reserving ship timber in the State forests, they refer only\r\nto special classes of forest.\r\n\r\nIn the frontier forests reserved for defensive purposes, timber cutting\r\nwas forbidden. And in the holy groves set aside by private or public\r\ndeclaration no wood could be cut thereafter, being in the latter case\r\nconsidered nobody’s property but sanctified and dedicated to religious\r\nuse (_res sacra_), and whoever removed any wood from them was considered\r\na “patricide,” except the cutting be done for purposes of improvement\r\n(thinnings) and after a prescribed sacrifice.\r\n\r\nWith the extension of Christendom the holy trees and groves became the\r\nproperty of the emperors, who sometimes substituted Christian holiness\r\nfor the pagan, and retained the restrictions which had preserved them.\r\nThus the cutting and selling of cypress and other trees in the holy\r\ngrove near Antioch, and of _Persea_ trees in Egypt generally (which had\r\nbeen deemed holy under the Pharaos) was prohibited under penalty of five\r\npounds gold, unless a special permit had been obtained.\r\n\r\nIn Attica as well as in Rome the theory that the State cannot\r\nsatisfactorily carry on any business was well established. Hence, the\r\nState forests were rented out under a system of time rent or a perpetual\r\nlicense, the renters after exploiting the timber usually subletting the\r\nculled woods merely for the pasture, except where coppice could be\r\nprofitably utilized. The officials, with titles referring to their\r\nconnection with the woods, as the Roman _saltuarii_ or the Greek\r\n_hyloroi_ (forestguards) and _villici silvarum_, the overseers, both\r\ngrades taken from the slaves, had hardly even police functions.\r\n\r\n_Forest management_ proper, _i.e._, regulated use for continuity, except\r\nin coppice, seems nowhere to have been practiced by the ancients,\r\nalthough _arboriculture_ in artificial plantations was well established\r\nand occasionally even attempts at replacement in forest fashion seem to\r\nhave been made deliberately. Not only were many arboricultural practices\r\nof to-day well known to them, but also a number of the still unsettled\r\ncontroversies in this field were then already subjects of discussion.\r\n\r\nThe culling system of taking only the most desirable kinds, trees and\r\ncuts, which until recently has characterized our American lumbering\r\nmethods was naturally the one under which the mixed forest was\r\nutilized. Fire used in the pasture woods for the same purposes as with\r\nus effectively prevented reproduction in these, and destroyed gradually\r\nthe remnants of old trees.\r\n\r\nOnly where for park and hunting purposes some care was bestowed upon the\r\nwoodland, was reproduction purposely attempted, as, for instance, when\r\nin a hunting park an underwood was to be established for game cover.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the coppice and methods of sowing and planting were\r\nwell understood in spite of the lack of natural sciences. Whatever\r\nforestry practice existed was based merely on empirical observations and\r\nwas taught in the books on agriculture as a part of farm practice.\r\n\r\nSilviculture was mainly developed in connection with the coppice, which\r\nwas systematically practiced for the purpose of growing vineyard stakes,\r\nespecially with chestnut (_castanetum_), oak (_quercetum_), and willow\r\n(_salicetum_), while the _arbustum_ denoted the plantings of trees for\r\nthe support of grapes, and incidentally for the foliage used as cattle\r\nfeed, still in vogue in modern Italy.\r\n\r\nThis planting of vine supports was done with saplings of elm, poplar and\r\nsome other species; by pollarding and by a well devised system of\r\npruning, these were gradually prepared and maintained in proper form for\r\ntheir purpose.\r\n\r\nThe coppice seems to have been systematically managed in Attica as well\r\nas in Italy in regular fellings; the mild climate producing sprouts and\r\nroot suckers readily without requiring much care, even conifers\r\n(cypress and fir) reproducing in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe oak coppice was managed in 7 year rotation, the chestnut in 5 year,\r\nand the willow in 3 year rotation.\r\n\r\nYield and profitableness are discussed, and the practice of thinnings is\r\nknown, but only for the purpose of removing and using the dead material.\r\n\r\nForest protection was poorly developed: of insects little, of fungi no\r\nknowledge existed. Hand-picking was applied against caterpillars, also\r\nditches into which the beetles were driven and then covered; the use of\r\nhogs in fighting insects was also known. That goats were undesirable in\r\nthe woods had been observed. Some remarkable precocious physiological\r\nknowledge or rather philosophy existed: it was recognized that frost\r\nproduces drought and that a remedy is to loosen the soil, aerating the\r\nroots, to drain or water as the case might require, and to prune; but\r\nalso sap letting was prescribed. Against hail, dead owls were to be hung\r\nup; against ants, which were deemed injurious, ashes with vinegar were\r\nto be applied, or else an ass’s heart.\r\n\r\nCuriosities in wood technology were rife and many contradictions among\r\nthe wood sharps existed, as in our times. Only four elements, earth,\r\nwater, fire, air, composed all bodies; the more fire in the composition\r\nof a wood, the more readily would it decay. Spruce, being composed of\r\nless earth and water but more fire and air, is therefore lighter than\r\noak which, mostly composed of earth, is therefore so durable; but the\r\nlatter warps and develops season splits because on account of its\r\ndensity it cannot take up readily and resists the penetration of\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nWood impregnation, supposed to be a modern invention, was already\r\npracticed; cedrium (cedar oil) being used as well as a tar coating or\r\nimmersion in seawater for one year, to secure greater durability.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Literature._\r\n\r\nAs regards literature, we find in Greece, besides what can be learned\r\nincidentally from the historians _Herodotus_ and _Xenophon_ and from the\r\nnatural history of Aristotle, the first work on plant history and wood\r\ntechnology, if not forestry, in 18 volumes by _Theophrastus_ (390-286\r\nB.C.), a pupil of Aristotle and Plato.\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans, besides a number of historians, at least three writers\r\nbefore Christ discussed in detail agriculture and, in connection with\r\nit, tree culture; namely, _Cato_ (234-149 B.C.) who wrote an excellent\r\nwork _De re rustica_, in 162 chapters; _Varro_ (116-26 B.C.), also _De\r\nre rustica_, in three books; and _Vergilius Maro_ (70-19 B.C.), who in\r\nhis _Georgica_ records in six books the state of knowledge at that time.\r\nOf the many writers on these subjects who came in the Christian era\r\nthere are also three to be mentioned, namely, _Cajus Plinius Major_\r\n(23-79 A.D.), who in his _Historia naturalis_, in 37 books, discusses\r\nalso the technique of silviculture; _Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella_\r\n(about 50 A.D.), with 12 books, _De re rustica_, and one book _De\r\narboribus_, the former being the best work of the ancients on the\r\nsubject; and _Palladius_, writing about 350 A.D., 13 books, _De re\r\nrustica_, which in the original and in translations was read until past\r\nthe middle ages.\r\n\r\nOnly a few references which exhibit the state of knowledge on\r\narboricultural subjects among the Romans as shown in this literature may\r\nbe cited, some of which knowledge was also developed in Greece and found\r\napplication, more or less, throughout the Roman empire from India to\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nNursery practice was already well known to Cato, while Varro knew,\r\nbesides sowing and planting, the art of grafting and layering, and\r\nColumella discusses in addition pruning and pollarding (which latter was\r\npracticed for securing fuelwood), and the propriety of leaving the\r\npruned trees two years to recuperate before applying the knife again.\r\n\r\nThe method of wintering acorns and chestnuts in sand, working them over\r\nevery 30 days and separating the poor seed by floating in water, was\r\nknown to Columella and, indeed, he discusses nursery management with\r\nminute detail, even the advantages of transplants and of doubly\r\ntransplanted material. The question whether to plant or to sow, the\r\npreference of fall or spring planting with distinction for different\r\nspecies and localities are matters under his consideration; and\r\npreference of sowing oak and chestnut instead of transplanting is\r\npointed out and supported by good reasons.\r\n\r\nPliny, the Humboldt of the ancients, recognizes tolerance of different\r\nspecies, the need of different treatment for different species, the\r\ndesirability of transplanting to soil and climatic conditions similar to\r\nthose to which the tree was accustomed, and of placing the trees as they\r\nstood with reference to the sun. But, to be sure, he also has many\r\ncurious notions, as for instance his counsel to set shallow rooted\r\ntrees deeper than they stood before, his advice not to plant during\r\nrain, or windy weather and his laying much stress on the phases of the\r\nmoon as influencing results.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile then the ancients were not entirely without silvicultural\r\nknowledge, indeed possessed much more than is usually credited to them,\r\nthe need of a forest policy and of a systematic forest management in the\r\nmodern sense had not arisen in their time; the mild climate reducing the\r\nnecessity of fuelwood and the accessibility by water to sources of\r\nsupply for naval and other construction delaying the need for forest\r\nproduction at home.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt, that some of the agricultural and silvicultural\r\nknowledge and practice of the Romans found entrance among the German\r\ntribes who, especially the Allemanni, came into contact with the Romans\r\nin their civilized surroundings during the fourth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Besides a dozen or more earlier histories of forestry in Germany,\r\n  some of which date back to the beginning of the 19th century, there\r\n  are two excellent modern compilations, namely:\r\n\r\n  _Geschichte des Waldeigenthums, der Waldwirtschaft und\r\n  Forstwissenschaft in Deutschland_, by AUGUST BERNHARDT, 1872-75, 3\r\n  Vols., 1062 pp., a classic, which treats especially extensively of\r\n  political and economic questions having a bearing on the development\r\n  of forestry; and\r\n\r\n  _Handbuch der Forst- und Jagdgeschichte Deutschlands_, by ADAM\r\n  SCHWAPPACH, 1886, 2 Vols., 892 pp., which appeared as a second\r\n  edition of Bernhardt’s history, abridging the political history and\r\n  expanding the forestry part. This volume has been mainly followed in\r\n  the following presentation of the subject. In condensed form this\r\n  history is also to be found in LOREY’S _Handbuch der\r\n  Forstwissenschaft_, 1888, Vol. I, pp. 143-210.\r\n\r\n  In Schwappach’s history a full list of original sources is\r\n  enumerated. These are, for the oldest period, Roman writings, which\r\n  are unreliable; the laws of the various German tribes; the laws of\r\n  kings (_Capitularia_); the laws of villages and other territorial\r\n  districts; “Weisthümer” (judgments); inventories of properties\r\n  (especially of churches and cloisters); documents of business\r\n  transactions and chronicles. For the time after the Middle ages the\r\n  most important source is found in the Forest Ordinances of princes\r\n  and other forest owners; forest laws; police orders; business\r\n  documents, and finally special literature.\r\n\r\nIt is generally conceded that both the science and art of forestry are\r\nmost thoroughly developed and most intensively applied throughout\r\nGermany. It must, however, not be understood that perfection has been\r\nreached anywhere in the practical application of the art, or that the\r\nscience, which like that of medicine has been largely a growth of\r\nempiricism, is in all parts safely based; nor are definitely settled\r\nforest policies so entrenched, that they have become immutable. On the\r\ncontrary, there are still mismanaged and unmanaged woods to be found,\r\nmainly those in the hands of farmers and other private owners; there are\r\nstill even in well managed forests practices pursued which are known\r\nnot to conform to theoretical ideals, and others which lack a sure\r\nscientific foundation; and while the general policy of conservative\r\nmanagement and of State interest in the same is thoroughly established,\r\nthe methods of attaining the result are neither uniform throughout the\r\nvarious States which form the German Federation, nor positively settled\r\nanywhere. In other words, the history of forestry is still, even in this\r\nmost advanced country, in the stage of lively development.\r\n\r\nFor the student of forestry the history of its development in Germany is\r\nof greatest interest not only because his art has reached here the\r\nhighest and most intensive application, but because all the phases of\r\ndevelopment through which other countries have passed or else will\r\neventually have to pass are here exemplified, and many if not most of\r\nthe other countries of the world have more or less followed German\r\nexample or have been at least influenced by German precedent. There is\r\nhardly a policy or practice that has not at some time in some part been\r\nemployed in the fatherland of forestry.\r\n\r\nOne reason for this rich historical background is the fact, that Germany\r\nhas never been a unit, that from its earliest history it was broken up\r\ninto many independent and, until modern times, only loosely associated\r\nunits, which developed differently in social, political and economic\r\ndirection. This accounts also for the great variety of conditions\r\nexisting even to-day in the 26 principalities which form the German\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nPolitically, it may be mentioned that out of the very many independent\r\nprincipalities into which the German territory had been divided,\r\nvariable in number from time to time, the 26 which had preserved their\r\nautonomy formed in 1871 the federation of States, known as the German\r\nEmpire. Each of these has its own representative government including\r\nthe forest administration, very much like the state governments of the\r\nUnited States; only the army and navy, tariff, posts, telegraphs,\r\ncriminal law and foreign policy, and a few other matters are under the\r\ndirect jurisdiction of the empire, represented in the Reichstag, the\r\nBundesrath, and the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe 208,830 square miles of territory,[2] which supports a population of\r\nabout 60 million people, still contain a forest area of around 35\r\nmillion acres (26% of the land area) or .61 acre per capita, which\r\nalthough largely under conservative management has long ago ceased to\r\nsupply by its annual increment (somewhat over 50 cubic feet per acre)\r\nthe needs of the population; the imports during the last 50 years since\r\n1862, when Germany began to show excess of imports over exports, having\r\ngrown in volume at the average rate of 10% to now round 380 million\r\ncubic feet (45 million dollars) or nearly 15% of the consumption.\r\n\r\n  [2] The statistics in this book do not pretend to be more than\r\n  approximations.\r\n\r\nThe larger part of Germany, two thirds of the territory and population\r\nis controlled by modern Prussia, with a total forest area of 20 million\r\nacres; Bavaria comes next with one seventh of the land area and 6\r\nmillion acres of forest; the five larger states of Wurttemberg, Baden,\r\nSaxony, Mecklenburg and Hesse, occupying together another seventh of\r\nthe territory with 5 million acres of forest. The balance of the area\r\nis divided among the other 19 states.\r\n\r\nFifty per cent. of Germany roughly speaking, is plains country, the\r\nlarger part in the northern and eastern territory of Prussia; 25% is\r\nhill country, mostly in West and Middle Germany; and 25% is mountain\r\ncountry, the larger portion in the southern states.\r\n\r\nThere are at best only five species of timber of high economic general\r\nimportance, the (Scotch) pine which covers large areas in the northern\r\nsandy plain and the lighter soils in the south; the (Norway) spruce and\r\n(Silver) fir which form forests in the southwestern and other mountain\r\nregions and represent, in mixture with broadleaf forest, a goodly\r\nproportion in the northeastern lowlands; the (English) oak, of which\r\nbotanically two species are recognized; and the beech. The last two are\r\nthe most important hardwoods found throughout the empire, but especially\r\nhighly developed in the west and southwest. In addition, there are half\r\na dozen species of minor or more local importance, but the five\r\nmentioned form the basis of the forestry systems.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe history of the development of forestry in Germany may be divided\r\ninto periods variously. Bernhardt recognizes six periods; Schwappach\r\nmakes four divisions, namely, the first, from the earliest times to the\r\nend of the Carlovingians (911), which is occupied mainly with the\r\ndevelopment of forest property conditions; the second, to the end of the\r\nMiddle Ages (1500), during which the necessity of forest management\r\nbegins to be sporadically recognized; the third, to the end of the 18th\r\ncentury, during which the foundation for the development of all branches\r\nof forestry is laid; the fourth, the modern period, accomplishing the\r\ncomplete establishment of forestry methods in all parts of Germany. For\r\nthe later historian it would be proper to recognize a fifth period from\r\nabout 1863, when, by the establishment of experiment stations, a\r\nbreaking away from the merely empiric basis to a more scientific\r\nfoundation of forestry practice was begun.\r\n\r\nFor our purposes we shall be satisfied with a division into three\r\nperiods, namely: first, to the end of the middle ages, when, with the\r\ndiscoveries of America and other new countries, an enlargement of the\r\nworld’s horizon gave rise to a change of economic conditions; second, to\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century, when change of political and economic\r\nthought altered the relation of peoples and countries; third, the modern\r\nperiod, which exhibits the practical fruition of these changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. FROM EARLIEST TIMES TO END OF MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\nMany of the present conditions, especially those of ownership, as well\r\nas the progress in the development both of forest policy and of forest\r\nmanagement, can be understood only with some knowledge of the early\r\nhistory of the settlement of the country.[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] FELIX DAHN, _Urgeschichte der germanischen und romanischen\r\n  Völker_, 1881.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, Aryan tribes from central Asia had more than a\r\nthousand years before Christ begun to overrun the country. These\r\nbelonged to the Keltic (Celtic) or Gaelic race which had gradually come\r\nto occupy partly or wholly, France, Spain, northern Italy, the western\r\npart of Germany and the British Islands. They were followed by the\r\n_Germani_ (supposedly a Celtic word meaning neighbor or brother), also\r\nAryan tribes, who appeared at the Black Sea about 1000 B.C., in\r\nSwitzerland and Belgium about 100 B.C. These were followed by the\r\nSlovenes, Slovaks, or Wends, crowding on behind, disputing and taking\r\npossession of the lands left free by, or conquered from the Germani.\r\nThrough these migrations, by about 400 A.D., the whole of Western Europe\r\nseems to have been fully peopled with these tribes of hunters and\r\nherders. The mixture of the different elements of victors and vanquished\r\nled to differentiation into three classes of people, economically and\r\npolitically speaking, namely the free, the unfree (serfs or slaves), and\r\nthe freedmen--an important distinction in the development of property\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Development of Property Conditions._\r\n\r\nThe German tribes who remained conquerors were composed of the different\r\ngroups of Franks, Saxons, Thuringians, Bajuvarians, Burgundians, etc.,\r\neach composed of families aggregated into communal hordes with an\r\nelected Duke (_dux_, _Herzog_, _Graf_, _Fürst_), organized for war, each\r\nin itself a socialistic and economic organization known as _Mark_,\r\nowning a territory in common, the members or _Markgenossen_ forming a\r\nrepublic. Outside of house, yard and garden, there was no private\r\nproperty; the land surrounding the settlement, known as _Allmende_,\r\n(commons) was owned in common, but assigned in parcels to each family\r\nfor field use, the assignment first changing from year to year, then\r\nbecoming fixed. The outlying woods, known as the _Marca_ or _Grenzwald_,\r\nforming debatable ground with the neighboring tribes, were used in\r\ncommon for hunting, pasturing, fattening of hogs by the oak mast, and\r\nfor other such purposes, rather than for the wood of which little was\r\nneeded. In return for the assignment of the fields, the free men, who\r\nalone were fully recognized citizens of the community, had to fulfil the\r\nduties of citizens and especially of war service.\r\n\r\nOnly gradually, by partition, immigration and uneven numerical\r\ndevelopment, was the original Mark or differentiation into family\r\nassociations destroyed and a more heterogeneous association of neighbors\r\nsubstituted. At the same time, inequality of ownership arose especially\r\nfrom the fact that those who owned a larger number of slaves (the\r\nconquered race) had the advantage in being able to clear and cultivate\r\nmore readily new and rough forest ground. Those without slaves would\r\nseek assistance from those more favored, exchanging for rent or service\r\ntheir rights to the use of land; out of this relationship a certain\r\nvassalage and inequality of political rights developed.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of Roman doctrine, a new aspect regarding newly\r\nconquered territory gained recognition, by which the Dukes as\r\nrepresentatives of the community laid claim to all unseated or\r\nunappropriated land; they then distributed to their followers or\r\ndonated to the newly established church portions of this land, so that\r\nby the year 900 A.D., a complete change in property relations had been\r\neffected. By that time the large baronial estates of private owners had\r\ncome into existence which were of such great significance in the\r\neconomic history of the Middle Ages, changing considerably the status of\r\nthe free men, and changing the free mark societies into communities\r\nunder the dominion of the barons.\r\n\r\nThe first real king, who did not, however, assume the title, was Clovis,\r\na Duke of the Franks, who had occupied the lower Rhine country. About\r\n500 A.D., picking a quarrel with his neighbors, the Allemanni, he\r\nsubdued them and aggrandized himself by taking their Mark. In this way\r\nhe laid the foundation for a kingdom which he extended by conquest\r\nmainly to the westward, but also by strategy to the eastward, the\r\nwarlike tribes of Saxons and other Germans conceding in a manner the\r\nleadership of the Franks.\r\n\r\nA real kingdom, however, did not arise until Charlemagne, in 772, became\r\nthe ruler, extending his government far to the East.\r\n\r\nAt times, the kingdom was divided into the western Neustria, and the\r\neastern Austria, and then again united, but it was only when the dynasty\r\nof Charlemagne became extinct with the death of Louis the Child (911),\r\nthat the final separation from France was effected, and Germany became a\r\nseparate kingdom, the eastern tribes between the Rhine and Elbe choosing\r\ntheir own king, Conrad, Duke of Franconia. There were then five tribes\r\nor nations, each under its own Duke and its own laws, comprising this\r\nnew kingdom, namely the Franks, Suabians, Bavarians, Saxons on the\r\nright, and the Lorainers on the left bank of the Rhine, while the\r\ncountry East of the Elbe river was mostly occupied by Slovenians.\r\n\r\nWith Clovis began the new order of things which was signalized by the\r\naggrandizement of kings, dukes and barons.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the rule regarding the ownership of unseated lands there\r\ndeveloped, also under Roman law doctrine, the conception of seignorial\r\nright, _i.e._, the power of the king to jurisdiction over his property.\r\nThis right, first claimed by the duke or king for himself, is then\r\ntransferred with the territory given to his friends and vassals, who\r\nthereby secure for themselves his powers and jurisdiction, immunity from\r\ntaxes and from other duties, as well as the right to exact taxes and\r\nservices from others, the favored growing into independent knights and\r\nbarons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe forest, then, originally was communal property and the feeling of\r\nthis ownership in common remains even to the present day. Indeed,\r\nactually it remained in most cases so until the 13th century, although\r\nthe changes noted had their origin in the 7th century when the kings\r\nbegan to assert their rights of princely superiority.\r\n\r\nIn these earlier ages, the main use of the forests was for the hunt, the\r\nmast and the pasture, and since wood was relatively plentiful, forest\r\ndestruction was the rule. Those who became possessed of larger\r\nproperties through the causes mentioned tried to secure an increased\r\nvalue of their possessions by colonization, in which especially the\r\nslaves or serfs were utilized. These often became freedmen, paying rent\r\nin product or labor, and acquiring the rights of usufruct in the\r\nproperty, out of which developed the so-called _servitudes_ or _rights\r\nof user_, the _praedium_ of the Romans, a limited right to use the\r\nproperty of another.\r\n\r\nWith the development of private property there naturally also developed\r\nthe right of preventing the hunting on such lands, this being then their\r\nmain use. This exclusive right to the chase or hunt we find recognized\r\nas a part of the property of the kings and barons in the 8th century,\r\nwhen the kings forbade trespass under penalty of severe fines; the\r\nking’s _ban_ (interdiction) of 60 shillings being imposed upon the\r\ntrespassers. Indeed, by the end of the 8th century the word _Forst_\r\n(_voorst_--_foresta_) which until then had been used merely to denote\r\nthe king’s property was exclusively used to designate not necessarily\r\nwoodland (the latter being referred to as _silva_ or _nemus_), but any\r\nterritory in which the hunt had been reserved.\r\n\r\nThis right to reserve the chase and the fishing, that is, to establish\r\n_banforests_ was in the 10th century extended by the kings to territory\r\nnot belonging to them, the right to the chase being according to the\r\nRoman doctrine a regal right over any property. Under this conception\r\nfields and pastures, woods and waters, and whole villages with their\r\ninhabitants became “inforested” grounds. The Norman kings, imbued with a\r\npassion for the chase, exercised this right widely, especially in\r\nEngland; the forests of Dean, Epping and the New Forest being such\r\ninforested territories, the inhabitants of which were placed under\r\nspecial “forest laws,” and adjudged by special “forest courts.”\r\n\r\nPresently the king’s right of ban was granted with the land grants to\r\nhis barons and to the clergy. Banforests also grew up through owners of\r\nproperties placing themselves and their possessions under the protection\r\nof kings or bishops or other powerful barons and giving in exchange this\r\nhunting right, and in various other ways. At the same time the headmen\r\nof the Mark (_Obermärker_, _Graf_, _Waldgraf_), who from being elected\r\nofficers of the people had become officials of the king, began to\r\nexercise, by virtue of their office, the jurisdiction of the king, and\r\ndeclaring the ban for their own or their friends’ benefit, excluded the\r\n_Märker_ from their ancient right to hunt and fish freely over the\r\nterritory of the Mark.\r\n\r\nWhile in this way the freedom of the communal owners was undermined, the\r\ninstitution of banforests had nevertheless its value in that it led to\r\nforest protection, restriction in forest use and restriction in\r\nclearing, all this, to be sure, merely for the benefit of the chase.\r\nSpecial officers to guard the rights of the king, _forestarii_, chosen\r\nfrom the free and freedmen, and also superior officers, _forestmasters_,\r\nwere instituted, to administer the chase and enforce the restrictions\r\nwhich went with it.\r\n\r\nGradually, with the loss of property rights, there came also a change in\r\nthe political rights of the märker or commoners, through the large\r\nbarons interfering with self-government, assuming for themselves the\r\nposition of Obermärker, appointing the officials, and issuing strict\r\nforest ordinances to regulate the cutting of wood; finally, the original\r\nright which belonged to every commoner of supplying himself with wood\r\nmaterial, became dependent upon permission in each case, and thus his\r\ntitle to ownership became doubtful.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly also through the influence of Roman institutions with which\r\nthe Franks under their Merovingian kings came into close contact, there\r\narose that social and political institution which became finally known\r\nas the _feudal system_. By the grants of lands which the kings made out\r\nof their estates to their kinsmen and followers with the understanding\r\nthat they would be faithful and render service to their masters, a\r\npeculiar relationship grew up, based on land tenure, the land so granted\r\nbeing called a _fief_ or _feud_, and the relationship being called\r\n_vassality_ or _vassalage_. This vassalage denoted the personal tie\r\nbetween the grantor and grantee, the lord and the vassal; the lord\r\nhaving the obligation to defend the vassal, and the vassal to be a\r\nfaithful follower of his lord. Similar relationship arose from the\r\nsurrender by landowners of their estates to the church or to other\r\npowerful barons, to be received back again as fiefs and to be held by\r\nthem as tenants in exchange for rent or service. In this way a complete\r\norganization of society developed in which, from the king down to the\r\nlowest landowner, all were bound together by obligation of service and\r\ndefence, both the defence and service being regulated by the nature and\r\nextent of the fief. Finally, all kinds of property of whatever nature,\r\nas well as official positions which would give an income, were subject\r\nto be treated as fiefs. The obligations of the recipient were of\r\nvarious nature, but finally service in army or court became the main\r\none, giving rise to the class of knights (_Ritter_) or barons, while the\r\nfiefs to the small farmer gave rise to the class of peasants (_Bauern_,\r\nthis name appearing first in 1106 under Conrad II).\r\n\r\nThe fiefs of the higher class, while at first given only to the\r\nindividual, became early hereditary, and hereditary succession to\r\nestates and offices generally became the rule. Primogeniture in the\r\nsuccession to the estates did then not as in England prevail in Germany;\r\ninstead, either tenancy in common, or else equal division among the sons\r\nwas practised. As a result the very many small principalities came into\r\nexistence in the 14th and 15th centuries, these growing smaller and\r\nsmaller by subdivision. The first to institute the primogeniture rule by\r\nlaw was the house of Brandenburg (in the 15th century).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the class of peasants and knights, there came into\r\nexistence a third class, the burghers, when, by the order of Conrad I in\r\nthe beginning of the 10th century, towns were built with walls and\r\ntowers for defence against the encroachments of the Huns, who endangered\r\nthe eastern frontier Mark. In order to encourage the settlement of these\r\ntowns, any slave moving to town was declared a freeman; and the cities\r\nbecame free republics; gifts of land, including forest areas, were made\r\nto the cities, and the development of industries was encouraged in every\r\nway. These cities, favored by the kings, and, having become rich and\r\npowerful, in the later quarrels of the kings with the lawless nobility,\r\ngave loyal support with money and arms. In return for their loans, the\r\nforest properties of the kings were often mortgaged to the burghers;\r\nand, failing of redemption, were often forfeited to them. In this way\r\nand through purchases the city forests came into existence.\r\n\r\nStill other property conditions arose when, under Otto the Great (960),\r\ncolonization of the eastern country beyond the Elbe was pushed. In these\r\ncases, the Mark institution was absent, although the colonists did often\r\nbecome part owners in the king’s forest, or acquired parts of it as\r\ncommon property, or else secured rights of user in the nearest royal\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the period, due to these various developments, a great\r\nvariety of property conditions in forest areas had developed, most of\r\nwhich continue to the present time, namely royal properties, which by\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth\r\nwere in part to become state property; princely and lordly possessions\r\nunder separate jurisdiction, with or without entail, and mostly\r\nencumbered with rights of user; allodial possessions (held independent\r\nof rent or service); municipal possessions owned by city corporations;\r\ncommunal properties, the remnants of the Mark; and farmers’ woodlots\r\n(Bauernwald), resulting from partitions of the Mark.\r\n\r\nAll these changes from the original communal property conditions did\r\nnot, of course, take place without friction, the opposition often taking\r\nshape in peasants’ revolts; hundreds of thousands of these being killed\r\nin their attempts to preserve their commons, forests and waters free to\r\nall, to re-establish their liberty to hunt, fish and cut wood, and to\r\nabolish tithes, serfdom and duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Forest Treatment._\r\n\r\nAs stated, the German tribes which settled the country were herders and\r\nhunters, who only gradually developed into farmers while the country was\r\nbeing settled. At first, therefore, as far as the forest did not need to\r\ngive way to farm lands, its main use was in the exercise of the chase\r\nand for pasture, and especially for the raising and fattening of hogs;\r\nthe number of hogs which could be driven into a forest serving as an\r\nexpression of the size of such a forest. Oak and beech furnishing the\r\nmast were considered the preferable species. It is natural, therefore,\r\nthat, wood being plentiful and the common property of all, the first\r\nregulation of forest use had reference to these, now minor benefits of\r\nforest property, as for instance the prohibition of cutting mast trees,\r\nwhich was enforced in early times. The first extensive regulation of\r\nforest use came however, from the exercise of the royal right of the ban\r\nand merely for the avowed purpose of protecting the chase.\r\n\r\nReal forest management, however, did not exist, the _forestarii_\r\nmentioned in these early times being nothing but policemen guarding the\r\nhunting rights of the kings or other owners. The conception that wood on\r\nthe stump was of the same nature as other property and its removal theft\r\nhad not yet become established: “_quia non res possessa sed de ligno\r\nagitur_” (wood not being a possessed thing), a conception which still\r\npervades the laws of modern times to some extent.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of clearing farm lands for the growing population\r\ncontinued, even in the western, more densely populated sections, into\r\nthe 12th and 13th centuries. The cloisters were especially active in\r\ncolonizing and making farm land with the use of axe and fire, such\r\ncloisters being often founded as mere land speculations. Squatters, as\r\nwith us, were a frequent class of colonists, and in eastern Prussia\r\ncontinued even into the 17th and 18th centuries to appropriate forest\r\nland without regard to property rights.\r\n\r\nThe disturbed ownership conditions, which we have traced, led also often\r\nto wasteful slashing, especially in the western territory, while\r\ncolonization among the Slavs of the Eastern sections led to similar\r\nresults. In the 12th century, however, here and there appear the first\r\nsigns of greater necessity for regulating and restricting forest use in\r\nthe Mark forest, and for improvement in forest conditions with the\r\npurpose of insuring wood supplies.\r\n\r\nIn that century, division of the Mark forest begins for the alleged\r\nreason that individual ownership would lead to better management and\r\nless devastation. In the 12th and 13th centuries also, stricter order in\r\nthe fellings and in forest use was insisted upon in many places. In the\r\nforest ordinances of the princes and barons, which, of course, have\r\nalways reference to limited localities, we find prescriptions like the\r\nfollowing: The amount to be cut is to be limited to the exact needs of\r\neach family and the proper use of the wood is to be inspected; the\r\ntimber is to be marked, must be cut in a given time and be removed at\r\nonce; only dry wood is to be used for fuel and the place and time for\r\ngathering it is specially designated, similar to the present practice.\r\nThe best oak and beech are to be preserved (this, however, merely with\r\nreference to the mast), and in the Alps we find already provisions to\r\nreserve larch and pine. The charcoal industry is favored (because of\r\neasier transportation of its product), but permitted only under special\r\nprecautions. Bark peeling and burning for potash is forbidden. The\r\npasture is regulated with regard to the young growth, and sheep and\r\ngoats are excluded.\r\n\r\nSuch measures are, to be sure, found only here and there where local\r\nconditions gave rise to a fear of a timber famine; such communities may\r\nalso be found making attempts to protect themselves against reduction of\r\nhome supplies by forbidding the export of wood from their territory. An\r\namusing restriction of this kind is found at Altenstadt where the bakers\r\nwere forbidden to bake bread for any but the citizens of the town.\r\n\r\nThe first ordinance prohibiting for clearings is found at Lorsch in the\r\nRhenish country in 1165, and other ordinances with such prohibition are\r\non record in other parts in the 13th century. In 1237, at Salzburg,\r\nclearings were prohibited in the interest of the salt mines, “so that\r\nthe cut forest may grow up to wood again,” and also in other parts where\r\nmining interests made a special demand for props or charcoal the\r\nregulation of forest use was begun early.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of transportation in the absence of roads rendered\r\nlocal supply of more importance than at present, and this accounts for\r\nthe early measures to secure more economical use while distant woods\r\nwere still plentiful but unavailable.\r\n\r\nWhile in the 12th and 13th centuries a merely restrictive and\r\nregulative, or else a let-alone policy, “allowing the wood to grow up,”\r\nprevailed, we find in the 14th century the first beginnings of an\r\nattempt at forest extension or recuperation.\r\n\r\nIn 1309, Henry VII ordered the reforestation of a certain stripped area\r\nby sowing. Of the execution of this order we have no record, but the\r\nfirst actually executed plantation on record is that by the city of\r\nNuremberg, in 1368, where several hundred acres of burned area were\r\nsowed with pine, spruce and fir; and there is also a record that in 1449\r\nthis crop was harvested. In 1420, the city of Frankfort on the Main\r\nfollowed this example, relying on the Nuremberg seed dealer, whose\r\ncorrespondence is extant and who was invited to go to Frankfort for\r\nadvice how to proceed. He sowed densely in order to secure clear boles,\r\nbut expressed the opinion that the plants could not be transplanted; he\r\nalso relied on the phases of the moon for his operations.\r\n\r\nThe planting of hardwoods seems to have been begun much later; the first\r\nreference to it coming from the cloister and city of Seligenstadt, which\r\nagreed in 1491 to reforest annually 20 to 30 acres with oak.\r\n\r\nNatural regeneration by coppice was in quite general practice and proved\r\nsatisfactory enough for fuelwood production. The system of coppice with\r\nstandards was also frequently practised, the standards, 20 or 30 to the\r\nacre, being “reserved for the lord.”\r\n\r\nIn the timber forest, the unregulated selection system was continued\r\ngenerally through the period, although in 1454 we find in the Harz\r\nMountains a transition to a seed tree management, a few seed trees or\r\ngroups of seed trees being left on the otherwise cleared area, somewhat\r\nin the manner of the French _méthode à tire et-aire_. Toward the end of\r\nthe 15th century we find here and there a distinction made between\r\ntimber forest, where no firewood is to be cut, and “leaf forest” which\r\nis to serve the latter purpose, and is to be treated as coppice.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the period we find, however, various provisions which\r\nare unquestionably dictated by the fear of a scarcity of timber. The\r\ndiscovery that pasture prevents natural regeneration led to a\r\nprohibition of pasturing in the newly cut felling areas. In 1488, we\r\nfind already a diameter limit of 12 inches--just as is being advocated\r\nin the United States now--as a basis for conservative exploitation, the\r\ncity of Brunswick buying stumpage, and in the contract being limited to\r\nthis diameter, and in addition obligated to leave 15 oaks or aspen per\r\nacre for seed trees.\r\n\r\nAttempts at regulating the use of a given forest by division into\r\nfelling areas are recorded in 1359, when the city forest of Erfurt, 286\r\nacres, was divided into seven felling areas. It is questionable whether\r\nthis referred to a coppice with short rotation or whether a selection\r\nforest with seven periodic areas is meant.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that the first sporadic and, to be sure, crude beginnings\r\nof a forest management in Germany may be traced back to the 14th and\r\n15th centuries; but it took at least 250 to 350 years before such\r\nmanagement became general.\r\n\r\nOutside of the information found scattered in forest ordinances,\r\ninstructions and prescriptions of various kinds there is no forestry\r\nliterature to be recorded from this period except one single book,\r\npublished about the year 1300, by an Italian, Petrus de Crescentiis,\r\nwhich was translated into German. It was merely a scholastic compilation\r\non agriculture and allied subjects, mostly cribbed from old Roman\r\nwriters and without value for German conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. FIRST DEVELOPMENT OF FORESTRY METHODS.\r\n\r\n(Period 1500 to 1800.)\r\n\r\nThe period following the middle ages marks the gradual changes from the\r\nfeudal system to the modern State organizations and to considerable\r\nchange of ownership conditions and forest treatment. Various causes\r\nwhich led to an increased development of industrial life were also\r\ninstrumental in hastening the progress of forest destruction. At the\r\nsame time, during this period the germs and embryonic beginnings of\r\nevery branch of forestry, real forestry policy, forestry practice and\r\nforestry science are to be noted. By the end of this period, preparatory\r\nto more modern conditions, we find organized technical forest\r\nadministrations, well developed methods of silviculture and systems of\r\nforest management.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Development of Forest Property Conditions._\r\n\r\nA number of changes in the conceptions of political relations, in\r\nmethods of life and of political economy brought further changes in\r\nproperty conditions on the same lines as those prevailing in the 14th\r\nand 15th centuries. These changes were especially influenced by the\r\nspread of Roman law doctrine regarding the rights of the governing\r\nclasses; by the growth of the cities, favoring industrial development\r\nand changing methods of life; by the change from barter to money\r\nmanagement, favored by the discovery of America, by other world\r\nmovements, and by the resulting changes in economic theory.\r\n\r\nThrough the discovery of the new world and the influx of gold and silver\r\nthat came with it gave impetus to industry and commerce of the cities;\r\nthe rapid increase of money capital increased extravagance and induced a\r\ndesire for amassing wealth, which changed modes of life, changed\r\npolicies and systems of political economy.\r\n\r\nThe fiscal policy of the many little principalities was dominated by a\r\ndesire to get a good balance of trade by fostering exports of\r\nmanufactures, but forbidding exports of raw materials like forest\r\nproducts, also by forbidding imports, subsidizing industries, fixing\r\nprices by law, and taking in general an inimical attitude towards\r\noutsiders except in so far as they sent gold and silver into the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThis so-called mercantilistic system, which saw wealth not in labor and\r\nits products but in horded gold and silver, had also full sway in\r\nEngland under Cromwell, and in France under Colbert’s influence. This\r\nfiscal policy, which was bent upon bringing cash into the country, led,\r\nunder the direction of servile officials, to oppressive measures. A\r\nreaction naturally followed, when it was pointed out that the real\r\nwealth of a nation lies in its natural resources and in its labor. But\r\nthis so-called physiocratic doctrine had little practical influence\r\nexcept to prepare men’s minds for the reception of the teachings of Adam\r\nSmith at the end of the period.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the Roman law, deified by the jurists and commentators,\r\nundermined the national conceptions and institutions of free citizenship\r\nand of existing property relations; courts, legislation and\r\nadministration were subject to their sway, and this influence lasted, in\r\nspite of reactions, until the end of the 18th century. Under it the\r\ndoctrine of the _imperium_--the seignorage or superior power of the\r\nprinces (Hoheitsrecht)--was further developed into the _dominium\r\nterrae_, i.e., superior ownership of all the land, which gives rise to\r\nthe title and the exercise of the function of “_Landesherren_,” masters\r\nof the land, and confers the privilege of curtailing and even\r\ndiscontinuing private property rights. To sustain their position in each\r\nof the state units, a restriction of the autonomy of churches and\r\ncloisters, of the Mark and of the vassals became needful to the princes.\r\nThis was secured by taking the first under their protection, by making\r\nthemselves Obermärkers, and by changing vassals who held office in fief\r\ninto employes (Beamte). For a time the three privileged classes of\r\nprelates, knights and burghers, combined in the _Landstand_ or\r\n_Landtag_, participated in some of the functions of government,\r\nespecially in raising and administering taxes, but by the second half of\r\nthe 14th century the princes had become absolute, and the doctrine of\r\nthe _Hoheitsrecht_ was firmly established.\r\n\r\nUnder this doctrine, the historic position of the Mark is perverted and\r\ninstead of being the common property of the people, it becomes the\r\nproperty of the prince, on which he graciously permits the usufruct;\r\nfor, forest, pasture and water (Wald, Weide, Wasser) are _res publicae_,\r\nhence ownerless and at the disposal of the king. Through this new\r\nconstruction of relationship, as well as through the same machinations\r\nand tricks which the princes as _Obermaerker_ or headmen of the Mark had\r\nemployed during the foregoing period in usurping power, and partly\r\nthrough voluntary dissolution was the decadence of the social, economic\r\nand political organization of the Mark gradually completed.\r\n\r\nThe original usufruct of a property held in common is explained in the\r\nRoman sense as a _precarium_ or servitude, and from being a right of the\r\nwhole organization becomes a right of the single individual or group of\r\nindividuals. In this way the socialistic basis of the Mark is destroyed.\r\nThrough the exercise of the _Forsthoheit_, _i.e._, the superior right of\r\nthe prince over all forest property, by the _appointment_ of the\r\nofficials instead of their _election_, by issuance of ordinances, in\r\nshort, by the usurpation of the legislative and police power, the\r\npolitical power of the Mark is broken and the Thirty Years’ War\r\ncompletes the breakdown; the pride of the burgher and the peasant is\r\ngone, their autonomy destroyed and their economic and political\r\norganizations sink into mere corporations based on land tenure, which,\r\naccording to Roman doctrine come under the regulation of the State or\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\nThe nobility move into the cities and leave the administration of their\r\nestates to officials who are constantly pressed to furnish the means for\r\nthe extravagant life of their masters. These in turn harass and oppress\r\nthe peasantry, who finally become bondsmen, _Gutshörige_ (bound to the\r\nglebe) and lose their independence entirely. These, briefly, are the\r\nsteps by which the changes, social and economic, progressed.\r\n\r\nReforms in this situation of the peasantry began first in Prussia in\r\n1702, when bondage was abolished for all those who could purchase their\r\nhouses and farms from the gentry. As few had the means to do so, the\r\nresult was the creation of a proletariat, hitherto unknown because under\r\nthe old feudal system the lord had to feed his impoverished bondsmen\r\nfrom which he was now absolved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Changes in forest property_ in particular were brought about by the\r\nincrease of princely property through the various methods of exercising\r\nthe seignorage. Especially after the Thirty Years’ War ownerless tracts\r\nfalling under this right were plentiful. In addition, wherever waste\r\nlands grew up to wood, they were claimed by the princes:\r\n\r\n    “Wenn das Holz dem Ritter reicht an den Sporn\r\n    Hat der Bauer sein Recht verlorn.”\r\n\r\nWhen wood has grown up to the spur of the knight, the peasant has lost\r\nhis right.\r\n\r\nSome additions came from the secularization of church and cloister\r\nproperty, and others by the slices which the princes as Obermärker\r\nsecured from the Mark forests by various artifices. It is these\r\nproperties, which in Prussia were turned over by the King to the State\r\nin 1713, and by other princes, not until the 19th century.\r\n\r\nThe same means which the princes employed were used by the landed gentry\r\nto increase their holdings especially at the expense of the Mark from\r\nwhich in their capacity of Obermärker they secured portions by force or\r\nintrigue.\r\n\r\nThe peasants’ forest property--the Mark forest--had by the 19th century\r\nbeen almost entirely dismembered, part having come into the hands of the\r\nprinces and barons, part having been divided among the Märker, and part\r\nhaving become corporation forest in the modern sense.\r\n\r\nPartition had become desirable when the restrictions of use which were\r\nordered for the good of the forest became unendurable under the rigid\r\nrule of appointed officials, but the expected improvement in management\r\nwhich was looked for from partition and private ownership was never\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nAfter the Thirty Years’ War the free cities were impoverished and their\r\nautonomy undermined by Roman doctrine. From free republics they became\r\nmere corporations under the supervision of appointed officials, and\r\nexperienced decadence in political as well as material directions.\r\nHence, no increase in city forest took place except through division of\r\nthe Mark forest in which cities had been co-owners, and through\r\nsecularized properties of cloisters.\r\n\r\nThe worst feature, from the standpoint of forest treatment, which\r\nresulted from these changes in property conditions and relationship, was\r\nthe growth of the pernicious servitudes or rights of user, which were\r\neither conferred to propitiate the powerless but dangerous peasantry, or\r\nevolved out of the feudal relations. From the 16th to the 19th centuries\r\nthese servitudes grew to such an extent that in almost every forest some\r\none outside of the owner had the right to use parts of it, either the\r\npasture, or the litter, or certain classes or sizes of wood.\r\n\r\nThese rights have proved the greatest impediment to the progress of\r\nforestry until most recent times, and only within the last few decades\r\nhave the majority of them been extinguished by legal process or\r\ncompromise.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Forest Conditions._\r\n\r\nUnder the exercise of these various rights and the uncertainty of\r\nproperty conditions, the forest conditions naturally deteriorated\r\ncontinuously until the end of the 18th century; the virgin woods were\r\nculled of their wealth and then grew up to brush, as is usual in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nEvery forest ordinance began with complaints regarding the increasing\r\nforest devastation, and predicted a timber famine in view of the\r\nincreasing population, increasing industry and commerce, and hence\r\nincreased wood consumption. Especially along the water routes, which\r\nfurnished the means of transportation, the available supplies were\r\nruthlessly exploited. More serious enemies than the exploitation of the\r\ntimber proved the pasturing of cattle, the removal of the litter, and\r\nabove all, the fires.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 16th century, ordinances against forest fires\r\nbegan to be enacted; yet, as late as 1778, the necessity of keeping the\r\nrides or fire lanes open in the forests of Eastern Prussia is justified\r\nby the statement that “otherwise the still constantly recurring fires\r\ncould not be checked.” At another place it is stated that “not a single\r\nacre of forest could be found in the province that had not been burnt in\r\nformer or later times,” and that “the people are still too much\r\naccustomed to the ruthless use of fires, so that no punishment can stop\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nOther causes of devastation were the Thirty Years’ War, the wars of the\r\n18th century, and the loss of interest in the forest by the peasants\r\nafter the collapse of the Mark. These had often to steal what they\r\nneeded, and their depredations were increased by the desire to revenge\r\nthemselves on the landed proprietors for the oppressions to which they\r\nwere subjected. The increase in game, which was fostered by the landed\r\ngentry, did much damage to the young growths, and the increase in the\r\nliving expenses of the nobility who mostly abandoned country for town\r\nhad to be met by increased exploitation.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the middle ages the reduction of forest area had proceeded\r\nso far that it was generally believed desirable to restrict the making\r\nof clearings to exceptional necessities, except in the northeastern\r\nparts and in the distant mountain districts.\r\n\r\nYet a growing population increased the need for farm land, and since\r\nintensive use of the existing farm area was not attempted until the end\r\nof the 18th century, the forest had to yield still further.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Methods of Restriction in Forest Use._\r\n\r\nAll ordinances issued by the princes to regulate the management of their\r\nproperties contain the prescription, that permission of the _Landesherr_\r\nis necessary for clearings, and that abandoned fields growing up to wood\r\nare to be kept as woodland; this partly for timber needs, partly for\r\nconsiderations of the chase. Still, Frederick the Great in colonizing\r\nEast Prussia, expressed himself to the effect that he cared more for men\r\nthan for wood, and enjoined his officials to colonize especially the\r\nwoods far from water, which entailed even more waste of wood than where\r\nmeans of transportation allowed at least partial marketing.\r\n\r\nImprovident clearings proceeded even under his reign on the Frische\r\nNehrung between Danzig and Pillau, and started the shifting sands of\r\nthat peninsula.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of all knowledge as regards the extent of existing\r\nsupplies or of the increment, and with poor means of transportation, at\r\nleast local distress was imminent.\r\n\r\nTo stave off a threatening timber scarcity, regulation in the use of\r\nwood was attempted by the forest ordinances, even to the extent of\r\nforbidding the hanging out of green brush to designate a drinking hall,\r\nor the cutting of May trees,--similar to our crusade in the United\r\nStates against the use of Christmas trees. A diameter limit to which\r\ntrees might be permitted to be cut, was also frequently urged.\r\nRegulation of forest use did not confine itself to the princely\r\nproperties alone, but, in the interest of the whole, the restrictions\r\nwere extended to all owners. These restrictions were directed either to\r\nthe practice in the exploitation of the forest or in the use of the\r\nmaterial. In the latter direction the attempts at reducing the\r\nconsumption of building timber are of special interest. Building\r\ninspectors were to approve building plans and inspect buildings to see\r\nthat they were most economically constructed; that repairs were made\r\npromptly, to avoid the necessity of more extensive ones; that new\r\nbuildings replacing old ones were not built higher than the old ones. In\r\nSaxony, as early as 1560, it was ordered that the whole house must be\r\nbuilt of stone, while elsewhere, the building of stone base walls and\r\nthe use of brick roofs instead of shingles was insisted upon.\r\n\r\nEven the number of houses in any community was restricted. Fences were\r\nto be supplanted by hedges and ditches. Economies in charcoal burning,\r\nin potash manufacture for glass works, and in the turpentine industry\r\nwere prescribed, and about 1600, the burning of potash for fertilizer\r\nwas forbidden entirely; but these laws proved unavailing. Even in\r\nfuel-wood a saving was to be effected by using only the poorer woods and\r\nwindfalls, by instituting public bake ovens (still in use in\r\nWestphalia), by improving stoves, restricting the number of bathing\r\nrooms, etc.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of fuelwood seems to have been enormous, for we find\r\nrecord of 200 cords used by one family in a year and of 1,200 cords or\r\nmore used by the Court at Weimar during the same time.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of turf and coal for firewood was ordered in some\r\nsections in 1697 and again in 1777, but practically not until 1780 did\r\ncoal come in as a substitute. Tanbark peeling was also forbidden, or\r\nonly the use of bark of trees soon to be felled was allowed. For\r\ncooperage only the top-dry oak; for coffins only soft-wood, or,\r\naccording to Joseph II of Austria, no wood, but black cloth was to be\r\nused. In some parts of the country the use of oak was restricted, even\r\nas early as 1562.\r\n\r\nFor regulating practices in the forest the restrictions often took only\r\nthe general form of forbidding devastation, without specifying what that\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\nThen, besides establishing a diameter limit, and regulating pasture in\r\norder to protect young growth, excluding sheep and goats entirely, an\r\nattempt was made to secure at least orderly procedure in the fellings.\r\nForesters were to designate what was to be cut even for firewood.\r\nMarking irons and hammers were employed for this purpose by the middle\r\nof the 15th century (usually two markings, by forester and by inspector\r\nto check). And this designation by officials extended even into the\r\nprivate forest, where finally no felling was allowed without previous\r\npermission and designation by a forester.\r\n\r\nThe use of the litter by the small farmers had grown to a large extent\r\nin these times and it was thought desirable to stop it, but this aid to\r\nthe poor peasant was so necessary that only regulating the gathering of\r\nit could be insisted upon.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that all these various attempts at securing a\r\nconservative forest use were by no means general but refer to\r\ncircumscribed territory, and much of it was only paper legislation\r\nwithout securing actual practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Development of Forest Policy._\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the 18th century we find, besides these\r\nprescriptions against wasteful use, and ordinances regulating the\r\nmanagement of the properties of the princes, definite forest policies in\r\nsome sections, having in view forest preservation and improvement of\r\nforest conditions, and also means of providing wood at moderate prices.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1515 and 1590, most of the German States had already\r\nenacted ordinances which had the force of general law exercising police\r\nfunctions over private forest property, although in Prussia this general\r\nlegislation did not occur until 1720. The objects in view with this\r\nlegislation were entirely of a material kind: the conservation of\r\nresources. Besides securing the rights of the _Landesherr_ to the chase,\r\nit was to secure a conservative use of the princely as well as private\r\nforests, since devastation of the latter would require the former to be\r\ndrawn on extravagantly; it was to stave off a timber famine, and in\r\ncertain localities to assure particularly the mining industry of their\r\nwood supplies. There were, however, concessions made to the privileged\r\nand influential classes of forest owners.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 18th century, this forest police, owing to the\r\nuncontrolled harshness and the grafting practices of the lower\r\nofficials had become the most hated and distasteful part of the\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe argument of the protective influence of forest cover did not enter\r\ninto this legislation; this argument belongs to the 19th century.\r\n\r\nYet reboisement of torrents had already in 1788, been recognized as a\r\nproper public measure in German Austria, although active work in that\r\ndirection was not begun until nearly a century later.\r\n\r\nThe rise of prices during the 17th and 18th centuries had been very\r\nconsiderable, doubling, trebling and even quadrupling in the first half\r\nof the 18th century. The mercantilistic doctrines of the time led,\r\ntherefore, to attempts to keep prices low by prescribing rates for wood\r\nand in general by restricting and regulating wood commerce.\r\n\r\nThis was done especially by interdicting sale to outsiders, forbidding\r\nexport from the small territory of the particular prince; or, at least,\r\ngiving preference to the inhabitants of the territory as purchasers and\r\nat cheaper rates.\r\n\r\nOwing to the small size of the very many principalities, the free\r\ndevelopment of trade was considerably hampered by these regulations.\r\nSometimes also wood imports were prohibited, as for instance, in\r\nWurttemberg, when, in 1740, widespread windfalls had occurred which had\r\nto be worked up and threatened to overstock the market.\r\n\r\nWood depots under government control were established in large cities,\r\nand the amount of wood to be used per capita prescribed, as in\r\nKoenigsberg (1702).\r\n\r\nIn Berlin, in 1766, a monopoly of the fuel wood market was rented to a\r\ncorporation, excluding all others except by permission of the company.\r\nThis was in 1785 supplanted by government administration of the\r\nwoodyards.\r\n\r\nAnother such monopoly was created in the “Nutzholzhandelsgesellschaft”\r\n(Workwood sales agency) for the export trade of building materials from\r\nKurmark and Magdeburg, which had prior right of purchase to all timber\r\ncut within given territory, the idea being to provide cheap material for\r\nthe industries. This, too, came into the hands of the State in 1771.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia, to prevent overcharges, the Jews were excluded from the wood\r\ntrade in 1761.\r\n\r\nThe exercise of the Forsthoheit (princely supervision), originating in\r\nthe ban forests, and favored by the mercantilistic and absolutist ideas\r\nof the 17th and 18th centuries, gradually grew until the end of the 18th\r\ncentury to such an extent that the forest owners themselves were not\r\nallowed to cut a tree without sanction of some forest official, and\r\ncould not sell any wood without permission, even down to hop-poles,\r\nalthough the large landed property owners vigorously resisted this\r\nassumption of supervisory powers. Much discussion and argument regarding\r\nthe origin of this right to supervision was carried on by the jurists\r\nupon the basis of Roman law doctrine, and it was proved by them to be of\r\nancient date. The degree, however, to which this supervision was\r\ndeveloped varied considerably in the different parts of the empire,\r\naccording to different economic conditions. The interference, and the\r\nprotection of forests appeared more necessary, where advanced\r\ncivilization and denser population created greater need for it. We find\r\ntherefore that the restrictive policy was much more developed in the\r\nSouthern and Western territories than in the Northern and Eastern ones,\r\nwhere the development begins two centuries later.\r\n\r\nThe oldest attempts of controlling private forest property are found in\r\nBavaria (1516), Brunswick (1590) and Wurttemberg (1614). Here, forest\r\nproperties were placed either entirely under the supervision of the\r\nprincely forest administration, or, at least, permission for intended\r\nfellings had to be secured. Later, these restrictions were considerably\r\nreduced in rigor (Bavaria, 1789).\r\n\r\nIn Prussia, private forest property remained free from government\r\ninterference well into the 18th century. An edict by the Great Elector,\r\nin 1670, merely inveighs against the devastation of forests by their\r\nowners, but refrains from any interference; and the Forstordnung of 1720\r\nalso contains only the general injunction to the owners not to treat\r\ntheir forests uneconomically. But, in 1766, Frederick the Great\r\ninstituted a rigid supervision providing punishment for fellings beyond\r\na special budget determined by experts. Soon after the French\r\nrevolution, however, unrestricted private ownership was re-established.\r\n\r\nChurch and cloister property had always been severely supervised,\r\nsimilar to the Mark and other communal forest property, under the\r\ndirection either of specially appointed officials or the officials of\r\nthe princes. Finally, in some sections (Hesse-Kassel, 1711; Baden,\r\n1787), the management of these communal forests was entirely undertaken\r\nby the government.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia, by the Order of 1754, the foresters of the State were\r\ncharged with the supervision of the communal forests, in which they were\r\nto designate the trees to be felled and the cultures to be executed; but\r\nas there was no pay connected with this additional duty and the\r\ndistricts were too large, the execution of this supervision was but\r\nindifferently performed.\r\n\r\nIn 1749, a special city forest order placed the city forests in Prussia\r\nunder the provincial governments, requiring for their management the\r\nemployment of a forester and the inspection of his work by the\r\nprovincial forestmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Personnel._\r\n\r\nAlthough all this supervision was probably more or less lax, the\r\npossibility of more general and incisive influence was increasing\r\nbecause the personnel to whom such supervision could be intrusted was at\r\nlast coming into existence.\r\n\r\nThe men in whose hands at the beginning of the 18th century lay the task\r\nof developing and executing forest policies and of developing forestry\r\npractice came from two very different classes. The work in the woods\r\nfell naturally to the share of the huntsmen and forest guards, who by\r\ntheir practical life in the woods had secured some wood lore and\r\ndeveloped some technical detail upon empiric basis. These so-called\r\n_holzgerechte Jaeger_ (woodcrafty hunters) prepared for their duties by\r\nplacing themselves under the direction of an established huntsman, who\r\ntaught them what he knew about the rules of the chase, while by\r\nquestioning woodchoppers, colliers, etc., and by their own observation\r\nthe knowledge of woodcraft was acquired.\r\n\r\nAt the head of affairs stood the so-called _cameralists_ or chamber\r\nofficials, men who had prepared themselves by the study of philosophy,\r\nlaw, diplomacy and political economy for the positions of directors of\r\nfinance and State administration. Rather ignorant of natural science,\r\nand without practical forestry knowledge, their efforts were not always\r\nwell directed. They deserve credit, however, for having collected into\r\nencyclopædic volumes the empiric knowledge of the practitioners or\r\nHolzgerechten, and for having elaborated it more or less successfully.\r\nIn this work they were joined by some of the professors of cameralia and\r\nlaw at the universities.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the 18th century the hunters had so far grown in\r\nknowledge and education as to be able to produce their knowledge in\r\nbooks of their own. Quite a literature developed full of acrimonious\r\nwarfare of opinions, as is the rule where empiricism rules supreme.\r\n\r\nNotable progress, however, came only when hunting was placed in the\r\nbackground and more or less divorced from forest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Development of Silviculture._\r\n\r\nIn addition to the restrictive measures and attempts at mere\r\nconservative lumbering without much thought of reproduction, there were\r\nas early as the 16th century silvicultural methods applied to secure or\r\nfoster reproduction.\r\n\r\nOwing to differences in local conditions and difference in necessities,\r\nthis development varied greatly in various sections as to the time it\r\ntook place. The Western and Middle country practiced as early as the\r\n16th century what in the Eastern country did not appear until the 18th\r\ncentury. The forest ordinances, from which we derive our knowledge or\r\ninferences of these conditions, prescribed, to be sure, many things that\r\nprobably were not really put into practice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\na. _Natural regeneration_ was at first merely _favored_, without the\r\nadoption of any very positive measures to secure it, namely, by removing\r\nthe cut wood within the year, so as to give young growth a chance of\r\nestablishing itself, by removing the brush so as not to smother the\r\nyoung growth, by keeping out cattle from the young growth (Schonung).\r\n\r\nIf the selection method of lumbering, most generally practiced without\r\nmuch plan, did not produce any desirable result in reproduction, the\r\nclear cutting which was practiced without system where charcoal\r\nmanufacturing or river driving invited to it, did even less so. In\r\neither case, besides the defective and damaged old stubs which were left\r\nin the logging, a poor aftergrowth of undesirable character remained, as\r\nis the case in the American woods on so many areas.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1524 and 1529, we have record of a conscious attempt to\r\nsecure a reproduction by leaving ten to thirty seed trees per acre; but\r\nthe result was disappointing, for this practice, being applied to the\r\nshallow-rooted spruce, produced the inevitable result, namely, the seed\r\ntrees were thrown by the winds.\r\n\r\nThis experience led to the prescription (in 1565) in the Palatinate to\r\nleave, besides seed trees, parts of the other stand for protection\r\nagainst wind damage; later, wind protection was sought by leaving\r\nparcels standing on all four sides, giving rise to a checkerboard\r\nprogress of fellings or a _group system_ of reproduction, which by the\r\nmiddle of the 18th century had developed into the regular _strip\r\nsystem_, applied in Austria (1766) to fir and spruce, and in Prussia\r\n(1764) to pine. And this marginal seeding method remained for a long\r\ntime the favorite method for the _conifers_.\r\n\r\nTo avoid long strips and distribute the fellings more conveniently, v.\r\nBerlepsch (in Kassel) recommended (in 1760) the cutting in echelons\r\n(curtain method, Kulissenhieb), which insured better seeding, but also\r\nincreased danger from windfalls, and was never much practiced, the\r\ndisadvantages of the method being shown up especially in the Prussian\r\nForest Order of 1788.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the 18th century it was recognized that the wind\r\ndanger would be considerably reduced by making the fellings progress\r\nfrom East or Northeast to West. The conception of a regular, properly\r\nlocated felling series was first elaborated in the Harz mountains in\r\n1745 by von Langen, who also accentuated the necessity of preserving a\r\nwind mantle on exposed situations. Both of these propositions reappear\r\nin the Prussian Order of 1780, according to which fellings are to\r\nproceed in a breadth of twenty to thirty-five rods from East to West.\r\n\r\nThe application of a _nursetree method_ for conifers was proposed in\r\n1787 by v. Burgsdorf (Prussia), a dark position (Dunkelschlag) and a\r\nregeneration period of seven years being advocated.\r\n\r\nIn broadleaved forest, besides the selection forest, the natural result\r\nof the sprouting capacity of the hardwood had led to a coppice method\r\nwhich was extensively relied upon for fuel production. This was rarely,\r\nhowever, a simple _coppice_, for, intentionally or unintentionally, some\r\nseedlings or sprouts would be allowed to grow on, leading to a composite\r\nforest and finally to a regular _coppice with standards_ (1569, etc.),\r\nwith an intentional holding over of the valuable oak and ash for\r\nstandards. Probably, however, large areas of unconsciously produced\r\ncomposite forest exhibited sad pictures of branchy overwood with\r\nsuppressed underwood of poor sprouts, injured by game and cattle--a\r\nscrubby growth, into which crept softwoods of birch and aspen. Attempts\r\nat _pruning_ such scrub growths into shape on quite an extensive scale\r\nare on record.\r\n\r\nThe recognition that more wood per acre could be secured by lengthening\r\nthe rotation of the coppice, which seems to have been mostly twelve\r\nyears or less, led to twenty and thirty year turns and finally to fifty,\r\nsixty and even eighty year rotations or so-called _polewood management_\r\n(Brunswick, 1745), also called _Hochwald_ (high forest).\r\n\r\nA full description and working plan for such a forest to be managed in\r\neighty year rotation, the city forest of Mainz in the Odenwald and\r\nSpessart mountains, dates from 1773, and this polewood forest management\r\nbecame quite general after the middle of the 18th century, but in the\r\nlast half of the 19th century it was generally replaced by the true high\r\nforest management under nursetrees, the experiences with the natural\r\nreproduction of conifer forest having proved the advantages of this\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nThe primitive beginnings of this so-called _Femelschlag_ method\r\n(Compartment selection or shelterwood method) are found, in 1720, in\r\nHesse Darmstadt, where Oberforstmeister von Minnigerode prescribed\r\nregular fellings progressing from north to south, in which all material\r\ndown to polewood size (in selection or virgin forest) was to be removed,\r\nexcepting only a number of clean boles, one every ten to twelve paces\r\nbeing left for seed and nursetrees. The good results in reproduction\r\nstimulated owners of adjoining estates to imitate the method (1737).\r\n\r\nThe observation that in beech forest the young crop needed protection\r\nand succeeded better when gradually freed from the shade of the seed\r\ntrees, especially on south and west aspects where drought, frost and\r\nweeds are apt to injure it on sudden exposure, led to the elaboration of\r\nthe principle of _successive fellings_.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinance of Hanau, as early as 1736, three grades of fellings\r\nwere developed, the cutting for seed, the cutting for light, which was\r\nto begin when the young crop was knee-high, and the removal cutting when\r\nthe crop was high.\r\n\r\nThis method spread rapidly and was further developed by the addition (in\r\n1767) of a preparatory cutting, to secure a desirable seedbed, and by\r\nlengthening the period of regeneration and elaborating other detail, so\r\nthat, by 1790, the principles of natural regeneration under nursetrees\r\nfor beech forest were fully developed in Western Germany.\r\n\r\nIn other parts, hardwood forest management was but little developed. The\r\nPrussian Forest Ordinance of 1786 contented itself with forbidding the\r\nselection method, by declaring natural regeneration, as practiced in the\r\npineries, not applicable; while the Austrian Ordinance of 1786\r\nrecognizes only clearing followed by planting as the general rule.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nb. _Artificial Reforestation._ Although sporadic attempts at sowing and\r\nplanting are on record as early as the beginning of the 14th century,\r\nextensive artificial reforestation did not begin until the middle of the\r\n18th century, by which time planting methods were quite fully developed.\r\n\r\nAmong the hardwoods, the _oak_ was the first to receive special\r\nattention. By the middle of the 16th century the forest ordinances gave\r\nquite explicit instructions for planting oak in the so-called\r\n_Hutewald_, a combination of pasture and tree growth such as is found\r\nto-day in the bluegrass region of Kentucky; the remnants of these poor\r\npasture woods with their gnarly oaks have lasted into modern times.\r\n\r\nIn the forest ordinance of Brunswick (1598) orders are given to plant on\r\nfelling areas: “every full farmer shall every year at the proper time\r\nset out ten young oaks, every half farmer five, every farm laborer\r\nthree, well taken up with roots (wildlings), and plant them in the\r\ncommons or openings at Martini (November) or Mitfasten (Easter) and\r\ncover them with thorn brush” (to protect them against cattle).\r\n\r\nAbout that time it was, indeed, incumbent on every marker to sow\r\nannually five oaks, or plant several young seedlings for every tree cut\r\nand to tend them a few years; and the custom existed in the low\r\ncountry,--afterwards (1700) introduced by law in Saxony--to plant in\r\ncelebration of certain occurrences--a kind of _arborday_--especially to\r\ncelebrate the marriage day; in order to be married the bridegroom had to\r\nprove that he had planted a certain number of oaks, which in Prussia\r\n(1719) had to be six, besides six fruit trees. The existence of this\r\ncustom, now long forgotten, has given rise in the United States to the\r\nstory that this is the method by which the German forest is maintained.\r\n\r\nThe method of collecting and keeping acorns over winter was well known\r\nin 1579, as is evidenced by the Hohenlohe Forest Ordinance, which\r\nadvised fall sowing, but, if that did not prove successful, to prepare\r\nthe ground in summer, leave it through the winter and sow in the spring.\r\n\r\nWhile, in earlier times, _sowing_ seems to have had the preference, at a\r\nlater period planting was practiced, at first with wildlings, but as\r\nearly as 1603 we find mention of oak nurseries.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian Order of 1720 ordered the foresters to plant oaks in the\r\nopenings before Christmas, for which they were to be paid, if the trees\r\nwere found alive after three years. The growing and culture of oak also\r\ninterested Frederick the Great, who ordered its extension everywhere.\r\nVery explicit and correct rules for growing and transplanting them, and\r\nsome to which we would not subscribe, were given in the books of the\r\n18th century. Among the planting methods we find, in 1719 and again in\r\n1776, one similar to the Manteuffel method of planting in mounds.\r\n\r\nWhile oak culture was especially fostered in Northwestern Germany, the\r\ncultivation of _conifers_ first received attention in the southwest, and\r\nin the same manner which was inaugurated by the Nuremberg seed dealer in\r\n1368. A new idea, introduced in the Palatine Forest Ordinance (1565) and\r\nin the Bavarian Forest Ordinance (1568), was the prescription, to soak\r\nthe seed before use and sow mixed with sawdust or sand, bringing the\r\nseed under with brush or iron rakes.\r\n\r\nCarlowitz (1713) taught well the methods of collecting, extracting and\r\nkeeping the seed, and even proposed seed tests. The seedbeds were to be\r\nmade as for carrots, dense sowings to be thinned, and the thinnings\r\ntransplanted into nursery rows, the seedbeds to be covered with moss and\r\nlitter to protect them against heaving; he also discusses the question\r\nof cost. The adaptation of plant material to different sites--conifers\r\nwhere oaks are not suitable--was also understood (Bavarian Forest\r\nOrdinance, 1683).\r\n\r\nAs long as the old method of extracting the seed in hot stoves or ovens\r\nprevailed, conifer sowings gave but indifferent results.\r\n\r\nIn the pine forests of Prussia, during the second half of the 18th\r\ncentury, the method of sowing the cones on large waste and sand barrens,\r\nwhere the sun would make them release the seed, was practised, and\r\nbefore Brémontier had written his celebrated _mémoire sur les dunes_,\r\nsanddunes had been recovered with pine plantations in Germany in the\r\nmanner which is still in vogue.\r\n\r\nThe _planting_ of conifers came into practice much later, and then it\r\nwas mostly done with wildlings. Opinions differing as to the value of\r\nsowing or planting, it was erroneously held until the 19th century that\r\nplanting was less successful and too costly in comparison with the small\r\nharvest yield, which necessitated cheapness of operations. It was only\r\ntowards the end of the 18th century that planting of pine was resorted\r\nto, but merely for repairing fail places in sowings and natural\r\nregeneration, and then with a ball of earth (1779), using a hollow\r\nspade,--a costly method. The cost of a certain plantation made in 1751\r\nis, however, reported as less than $3.00 per M., in 1770 as low as 70\r\ncents per M. To cheapen the operations the labor was exchanged for wood,\r\npasture or other materials or advantages.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia, in 1773, all recipients of free wood had to do service in\r\nthe cultures; in 1785, every farmer had to furnish a certain amount of\r\ncones or acorns. The method, lately adopted in Russia, came into vogue\r\nin Prussia in 1719, namely, of charging, besides the value of the wood,\r\na toll to be paid into the planting fund (about 7% of the value). This\r\nmethod was also imitated elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe use of the _Waldfeldbau_ (combined farm and forest culture) was also\r\ninaugurated for the purpose of cheapening the cost of plantations (by v.\r\nLangen in 1744) when the great movement for reforesting wastes and\r\nopenings began, the tree seed being sown with the grain either at once\r\nor after farm use for some years.\r\n\r\nRegular annual planting budgets (of $50--$100--$200) were inaugurated in\r\nBrunswick by v. Langen in 1745; and in 1781, the Prussian forest\r\nadministration had attained to entirely modern planting plans and annual\r\nplanting budgets.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that the fear of a timber famine and the apparent\r\nhopelessness of bringing improvement into the existing forest conditions\r\ncreated anxiety and a desire to plant _rapid growers_, such as birch,\r\nwillow, aspen, alder; the planting of the White Birch became so general\r\nin the beginning of the 18th century that a regular betulomania is\r\nrecorded corresponding to the incipient catalpomania in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAt that time, to be sure, firewood was still the main concern, and the\r\nuse of these rapid growing species had some justification. But where\r\nbirch was mixed in spruce plantations its baneful effects consisting in\r\nwhipping off the spruce tips and injuring its neighbors were soon\r\nrecognized, and much trouble was experienced in getting rid of the\r\nunwelcome addition.\r\n\r\nThe _Robinia_, which had been brought from America in 1638, was also one\r\nof the trees recommended in the middle of the 18th century and was much\r\nplanted until Hartig pointed out that the expectations from it were\r\nentirely misplaced.\r\n\r\nOf course no building material could be expected from these species,\r\nhence the larch, also a rapid grower, was transplanted from the Alps\r\n(1730 in Harz mountains), and its use was extended, as with us, to\r\nconditions for which it was not adapted.\r\n\r\nIt was principally a desire for novelty and perhaps for better,\r\nespecially foreign things, that led to the planting of North American\r\nspecies in parks during the first half of the 18th century. But,\r\nalthough F. A. J. von Wangenheim’s very competent writings on the\r\nAmerican forest-flora and on the laws of naturalization (1787)\r\nstimulated interest in that direction, the use of American species for\r\nforest planting was not inaugurated till nearly 100 years later, with\r\nthe single exception of the White Pine (_P. strobus_), of which large\r\nnumbers were planted.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Improvement of the Crop._\r\n\r\nThinning of stands had been practiced early in the 16th century, not for\r\nimprovement of the remaining stand so much as to secure fence material,\r\nalthough in 1531 the observation was already recorded that thinning\r\nimproved and stimulated the remaining growth.\r\n\r\nIn the 17th century, opposite views, or, at least doubts as to its\r\nusefulness were expressed in the forest orders, and sometimes thinning\r\nwas even forbidden. Even in the 18th century some of the prominent\r\nforesters, Doebel and Beckman, were opposed to it, and although others\r\nfavored the operation, the practice of it remained limited.\r\n\r\nIn 1761, we find the first good statement of the theory of thinnings by\r\nBerlepsch, who advised taking out the suppressed trees when the sound\r\npoles were clear of lower and middle branches; he also accentuated the\r\nfinancial argument of earlier returns and increased value of the\r\nremainder.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, Zanthier recommended two thinnings, namely, for\r\nconifers first in the thirtieth to fortieth year and again in the\r\nfiftieth year, for broadleaf forest first in the forty-fifth and again\r\nin the eightieth to ninetieth year.\r\n\r\nIn 1765, the financial gain from thinnings is figured by Oettelt, and\r\nthe possible reduction of the rotation due to thinnings is recognized by\r\nLeubert in 1774.\r\n\r\nJust as the thinning in polewoods arose from the need of earlier\r\nutilization, so the weeding of young growths was done for the purpose of\r\ngetting material for withes to bind the grain, etc.\r\n\r\nThe removal of coppice shoots in oak plantings was practiced in Prussia\r\nin 1719, and the thinning of too dense sowings was advised by Carlowitz\r\nin 1713. Yet much later, even such an intelligent man as Oettelt\r\ninveighed against the weeding out of the birch in spruce sowings because\r\n“nature prefers variety, with which preference it is not good to\r\ninterfere.”\r\n\r\nThis was in opposition to v. Langen (1745), who prescribed for the first\r\ntime regular cleaning or weeding, especially the removal of the\r\nsoftwoods, aspen and birch, and of coppice shoots from seedling forest.\r\nIt was also known that this weeding is best done “in the full sap,” in\r\norder to kill the stocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _Methods of Regulating Forest Management._\r\n\r\nOrganized forest management was slower to develop than silvicultural\r\nmethods. The first attempts to bring order into the progress of fellings\r\ntook the form of dividing the whole area into a certain number of\r\nfelling areas (12, 16, 20, 30, etc.), several ordinances dating from the\r\nmiddle of the 15th and 17th centuries containing prescriptions to that\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the numbers of these areas indicate years of\r\nrotation, in which case they could only have applied to coppice, or\r\nwhether they indicate periods of return in selection forest, although\r\nthe historians seem to jump to the former conclusion. The area division\r\npracticed by v. Langen in the Harz mountains (1745), who prescribed the\r\ndivision of larger districts into fifty to sixty, of smaller districts\r\ninto twenty to thirty felling areas, also leaves it doubtful, whether\r\nthe areas corresponded to an assumed rotation or to a period of return.\r\n\r\nAt first, the division was not into equal areas, for no survey existed,\r\nand its object was simply to localize the cutting and provide orderly\r\nprogress. The subdivision was made in the mountain country by following\r\nthe topography, valleys and ridges, while in the plain the lines opened\r\nup for purposes of the chase (to set up nets), called _Schneisen_ or\r\n_Gestelle_ (rides), bounding square areas called _Jagen_, _Quadrat_,\r\n_Stallung_, were used for the limitation of the felling areas. Most\r\ncommonly, however, largely due to absence of surveys, the ordered\r\ndivision did not materialize, but existed only on paper.\r\n\r\nWith more exact measuring of areas, and with the conception of a\r\nrotation or longer periods of return, it was recognized that the\r\ninequality of the sites or soil qualities, especially in mountain\r\ndistricts, produced very unequal felling budgets. To overcome this\r\ninequality, Jacobi, in Goettingen (1741) introduced _proportional_\r\nfelling areas, making the felling areas on poor sites permanently\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, v. Langen and Zanthier attempt to secure equal annual returns\r\nwithout slavishly holding to the geometric division, merely making sure\r\nthat the total area be cut over in the predetermined rotation.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts to introduce a regulated management by making a\r\n_volume_ division the basis is recorded from the Harz mountains in 1547.\r\nThis method, based on very crude estimates although upon very fair\r\nforest description, was continued into the 18th century.\r\n\r\nIn the last half of the 18th century all these crude methods were\r\nimproved, and applied on extensive areas.\r\n\r\nIn 1785, Zanthier combined area and volume division, determining the\r\nfelling budget on each felling area by counting and estimating the trees\r\nand calculating how many trees could be used annually under a sustained\r\nyield management; the area division being used only as a check or means\r\nof control.\r\n\r\nA very considerable advance was made by Oettelt, (who surveyed and\r\nregulated the Weimar forests in 1760) in the elaboration of details and\r\nestablishment of proper principles for regulating the felling budget.\r\n\r\nIn his forest description he introduces for the first time periodic age\r\nclasses, usually six, but of uneven length: Young growth, below twelve\r\nyears; thicket, twelve to twenty-four years; polewood, twenty-four to\r\nforty years; clear timber, forty to fifty; medium timber, fifty to\r\nseventy-five; mature timber, seventy-five years and over.\r\n\r\nHe divides the forest into proportional areas (which were marked by\r\nstones in the woods), equalizing them according to age, quality,\r\nincrement, soil, exposure, so as to secure equal annual budgets; the\r\nstands were ranged into seven or eight unequal age classes and each into\r\nas many annual felling areas as there are years in the age class; if\r\nsome of the age classes were absent, he extended the time for cutting in\r\nthe older class until the younger had grown to the proper age and by\r\nvarying the cut from good to poor sites for stands he tried to even out\r\nthe budgets. The volume budget he determined by average increment\r\nmeasurements. This method was, however, much too far advanced and\r\nrequired too much mathematics to find imitators at that time.\r\n\r\nAnother method which proved also too complex for the foresters of the\r\ntime was that of v. Wedell; nevertheless, by 1790, he had by it put into\r\nworking order 800,000 acres in Silesia. He divided this area into\r\ndistricts, the districts into blocks or management classes, and used an\r\nelaborated proportional area division for determining the felling\r\nbudget. He distinguished quality of stand and quality of site, and made\r\nfour site classes. The volume of stock, he found by means of sample\r\nareas, to which he added the increment in order to find the total volume\r\nfor harvest, when it could be determined how long with a given budget\r\nthe stands would last, or what average annual felling budget could be\r\ntaken before the next age-class would be mature.\r\n\r\nIn the North German plain, with very uniform conditions of soil and\r\ntimber, the method of equal felling areas was the most natural and most\r\neasily applied.\r\n\r\nFrederick the Great, who took a considerable interest in forestry\r\nmatters, ordered such an area division for the State pineries in 1740,\r\nfixing upon different numbers of felling areas, but finally, in 1770,\r\ndeciding on a rotation of seventy years. Lack of personnel retarded\r\nprogress in this forest survey and regulation until in 1778 v. Kropff\r\nundertook the direction. Not agreeing with his master regarding the\r\nshort rotation of seventy years, he arranged to have each district\r\ndivided into two working blocks, and by cutting alternately in these,\r\nmanaged to double that rotation. His successor, Hennert, in 1788,\r\ndevised a new method by introducing allotment of a number of annual\r\nfelling areas to a period of the rotation when at least the periodic\r\nbudget could be equalized. A value or money yield equalization of the\r\nfelling budgets was also attempted.\r\n\r\nFor easier handling, the forest was divided into small compartments or\r\nJagen and a classification of four, still uneven, periodic age classes\r\n(of different length for conifers and broadleaved forest), and three\r\nsite qualities were employed. The merchantable stock was ascertained by\r\na sample area method and the felling budget by dividing the oldest age\r\nclass by the number of years it must last until the next was ready.\r\nSince no attempt was made to secure a proper age class gradation, the\r\nmethod failed to improve conditions for the next rotation.\r\n\r\nSome 500,000 acres were regulated according to this plan in Prussia,\r\nprobably very superficially.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, Bavaria also ordered a division into annual felling areas.\r\n\r\nIn all these methods of regulating the yield or budget, the area played\r\nthe main role, the volume being only a secondary consideration.\r\n\r\nThe first elaboration of a pure volume division was made by Beckman in\r\n1759. He estimated stock on hand by trees and guessed more or less at\r\nthe increment, allowing 2.5, 2, and 1% for the different sites, and then\r\nmade a year to year calculation of stock for 125 years. How the felling\r\nbudget was finally determined is not known.\r\n\r\nTwo methods were simultaneously devised in Württemberg in 1783, which\r\nform the transition to the so-called _allotment_ methods, making\r\nperiodic age classes of an equal number of years and allotting either\r\nfelling areas or volumes to each period of the rotation. Incapacity of\r\nthe officials prevented the application of the one method, while the\r\nother, devised by Maurer, remained also only a proposition.\r\n\r\nBut, in 1788, Kregting in his Mathematical Contributions to Forestry\r\nScience teaches a pure volume allotment method with ten year age classes\r\nand nearly all the apparatus which was afterward developed by Hartig,\r\nwho in the next period dominated to such a large extent the development\r\nof forestry in all its branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _Improvements in Methods of Mensuration._\r\n\r\nIn scientific direction, the mathematical disciplines were the first to\r\nbe developed; the natural sciences received attention much later.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of mathematical knowledge was required for this\r\nwork of forest organization. The mathematical apparatus of the foresters\r\neven at the end of this period was rather slender, but its development\r\nwent hand in hand with the development of these methods of regulation;\r\nand even elaborate mathematical formulæ for determining felling budgets\r\nwere not absent.\r\n\r\nUntil nearly the middle of the 18th century, surveys of exact nature\r\nwere almost unknown; only when the division into equal or proportionate\r\nfelling areas became the basis for determining the felling budgets, did\r\nthe necessity for such surveys present itself.\r\n\r\nPlane table and compass were the instruments which came into use in the\r\nbeginning of the 18th century. But not until the latter half of that\r\ncentury were extensive forest surveys and maps of various character\r\nmade, especially in Prussia under Wedell, Kropff and Hennert.\r\n\r\nThe methods of measurement of wood developed still later. Until\r\nOettelt’s time no method of precise determination of volumes was known,\r\neverything being estimated by cords or by diameter breast-high and\r\nheight, or by the number of boards which a tree would make (board\r\nfeet?).\r\n\r\nThe diameter was sometimes used as a price maker, the price increasing\r\nin direct proportion to the diameter increase. Oettelt calculated the\r\nvolume of coniferous trees as cones, and _Vierenklee_, who wrote a book\r\non mathematics for the use of foresters, calculated timbers with the top\r\nremoved by using the average diameter, to which Hennert added the\r\nvolume of a cone with the difference of the two diameters as a base, to\r\nmake the total tree volume.\r\n\r\nMost measurements of standing trees were, of course, made on the\r\ncircumference, for, in the absence of calipers, the diameter could be\r\ndirectly measured only on the felled tree. Doebel had already measured\r\nthe height by means of a rectangular triangle, and the first real\r\nhypsometer with movable sights was described by Jung in 1781; and a\r\ncomplete instrument, which could be used for measuring both height and\r\ndiameter at any height, similar to some more modern ones, was\r\nconstructed by Reinhold.\r\n\r\nDetermination of the real wood contents in a cord of wood and of the\r\nvolume of bark by measurement was taught by Oettelt, and the method of\r\nimmersion in water and measuring the displaced volume, by Hennert\r\n(1782).\r\n\r\nIn 1785, Krohne first called attention to the variation of the increment\r\nin different age classes and the need of determining the accretion for\r\neach separately.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, Trunk taught how to determine average felling age increment,\r\nand also the method of determining the change of diameter classes, which\r\nis now used by the United States Forest Service: “On good soil a tree\r\ngrows one inch in three years, on medium soil in four years, on poor\r\nsoil in five years.” With this knowledge, the attainment of a given\r\ndiameter, or the change from one diameter or age class to the next could\r\nbe calculated.\r\n\r\nVolume tables were at Trunk’s command, and Paulsen in 1787, Kregting in\r\n1788, mention periodic yield tables; but generally speaking “ocular\r\ntaxation” or estimating was the rule, checked by experience in actual\r\nfellings, the method of the American timber looker. Generally, of\r\ncourse, only the log timber was estimated as with us, and only the very\r\nroughest estimating or rather guessing was in vogue until near the end\r\nof the period.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at closer measurement was made by Beckman (1756), who\r\nsurrounded the area to be measured with twine, drove a colored wooden\r\npeg into each tree, one color for each diameter class, when, knowing the\r\noriginal number of pegs that had been taken out, the difference gave the\r\nnumber of trees in each diameter class, and by multiplying the average\r\ncubic contents of a measured sample tree in each class by the number in\r\nthe class its volume was found.\r\n\r\nThe method, often employed at present, of ascertaining by tally the\r\ndiameter classes on strips forty to fifty paces wide, the so-called\r\nstrip survey, was described by Zanthier in 1763.\r\n\r\nThese measurements were usually confined to sample areas, the use of\r\nsuch being already known in 1739. The contents of the sample area, if a\r\nspecial degree of accuracy was desired, were ascertained by felling the\r\nwhole and measuring.\r\n\r\nOettelt, of mathematical fame, was the first to publish something about\r\nthe determination of the age of trees by counting rings, although the\r\npractice probably antedates this account. He knew of the dependence of\r\nthe ring width on the site and on the density of the stand.\r\n\r\nIt seems that long before this time the French had made the\r\ndetermination of yield in a more scientific manner, Réaumur reporting in\r\n1721 to the French Academy comparative studies of the yield of coppice\r\nand of volumes of wood.\r\n\r\nOettelt, too, laid the foundation of forest financial calculations when\r\nhe ascertained the value of a forest by determining the value of an acre\r\nof mature wood--the oldest age class--and multiplying it by half the\r\nacreage of the whole forest, suggesting the well known expression for\r\nthe normal stock (I r/2) soon after to be developed by an obscure\r\nAustrian tax collector.\r\n\r\nEven the first forest finance calculations with the use of compound\r\ninterest, and a comparison of the profitableness of the different\r\nmethods of management, are to be recorded as made by Zanthier in 1764,\r\nbringing the beginning of forestal statics into this period.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _Methods of Lumbering and Utilization._\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this period, rough exploitation was still mainly in\r\nvogue, only parts of trees being used, just as in the United States now.\r\nHere and there, attempts were made toward more conservative use; for\r\ninstance, at Brunswick in 1547, the use of log timber for fuel was\r\ndiscouraged; in Saxony, as early as 1560, the brushwood was utilized for\r\nfuel. High stumps were a usual feature in spite of the threats of\r\npunishment of the forest ordinances, as in Bavaria (1531). The axe was\r\nthe only instrument used until the end of the 18th century for felling\r\nas well as cutting into lengths; not until 1775, do we find an allusion\r\nto the use of the saw, when the forest ordinance of Weimar ordered that\r\nthe saw-cut should be made for three-fourths of the tree’s diameter and\r\nthe axe be used to finish (!) the last quarter. Not until the 18th\r\ncentury was the fuel-wood split in the woods, and it was near the end of\r\nthe period before it was set up in mixed cords (round and split) after\r\nthe splitting had been introduced. The measurement was, until about that\r\ntime, made merely in loads, the cord being of later introduction.\r\n\r\nThe value of low stumps and of the use of the saw was recognized in\r\nAustria in 1786. To show how variously and locally the need of\r\nconservative use of wood developed, we may cite the fact that in the\r\nHarz, about 1750, trees were dug with their roots as now in some of the\r\npineries of the Mark Brandenburg, in order to utilize more of the\r\nbody-wood and the root-wood. In 1757 we find stump-pulling machines\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nIn measurement of standing trees the circumference at breast-height was\r\nmeasured with a chain, and for the body-wood when felled the mean\r\ndiameter was employed.\r\n\r\nAs regards the felling time, specific advice is found in many forest\r\nordinances which recommend mostly winter felling, stating the proper\r\nbeginning and end of the season by the phases of the moon, the rule\r\nbeing that all white wood, for example conifers, beech and aspen should\r\nbe felled on the increase or waxing of the moon; oak, at the waning; but\r\ncoppice, because it is desired to secure a new growth, at the waxing\r\nmoon. Prescription was also made sometimes regarding the time by which\r\nthe removal of the wood from the felling area was to be finished (May to\r\nJune).\r\n\r\nMeans of transportation were poor up to the end of the period; snow, as\r\nin the United States, was in the Northern country the main reliance for\r\nmoving the wood. River driving, both with, and without rafts was well\r\norganized; various systems of log-slides were developed to a\r\nconsiderable extent; in one place even an iron pipe, 900 feet in length,\r\nis reported to have been used in such capacity.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the consumer cut his own wood, but in the middle of the 17th\r\ncentury special wood-choppers appear to have been employed, for, in\r\n1650, mention is made in Saxony of men, who, under oath to secure honest\r\nservice, were organized for the exploitation of the different classes of\r\nwood. A system of jobbers came into existence about this time, something\r\nlike the logging bosses in the United States (Holzmeister) who were\r\nresponsible for the execution of the logging job. The organization of\r\nwood-choppers went so far that, in 1718, we find in the Harz mountains\r\nmention of an Accident Insurance and Mutual Charity Association among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe sale of wood was at first carried on in the house; later it became\r\ncustomary to indicate in the forest the trees to be cut or the area from\r\nwhich they should be cut by the purchaser, and finally they were felled\r\nby the employes of the owner. For a long time, persisting into the 18th\r\ncentury, the sale was by area, and this method developed the necessity\r\nof surveying; at the same time, however, sales by the tree and by wood\r\nmeasure occurred, but only in the 18th century did the present method of\r\nselling wood by measure after felling come into existence. In Prussia,\r\nthe buyer had to take the risk of felling, and pay, even if the tree\r\nproved to be rotten, or broke in the felling. The forest owner seems to\r\nhave had the whip hand in determining the price one-sidedly, revising,\r\ni.e., increasing the toll in longer or shorter intervals. But, in 1713,\r\nwe find mention of wood-auctions, or at least similar methods of getting\r\nthe best prices. Finally, special market days for making sales and for\r\ndesignating of wood were instituted; on these days also, all offences\r\nagainst the forest laws were adjudged.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. _Forest Administration._\r\n\r\nThe administration of the different forest properties which the princes\r\nhad aggregated in the course of time was at first a part of the general\r\nadministration of the princely property. The requirements in the woods\r\nbeing merely to look after utilization and protection, illiterate\r\nunderlings (_Forstknechte_) were sufficient to carry out the police\r\nfunctions, generally under a _Forstmeister_, or _Oberforstmeister_, who\r\nfrom time to time would make an inspection tour. Later on, when a more\r\nintensive forest management had come into existence, it became customary\r\nto call in experienced foresters from outside to make inspections and\r\ngive advice.\r\n\r\nA much more elaborate organization of service is, however, reported in\r\nthe mining districts of the Harz mountains, in 1547, with the Director\r\nof Mines (_Berghauptman_) at the head, and different grades of\r\nofficials under him, who were called together periodically for reports\r\nand discussions.\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of the 18th century all those employed in the forest\r\nservice, at least those in the superior positions, had also duties in\r\nconnection with the chase, the head official of the hunt being also the\r\nhead of the forest service; and hunting had usually superior claims to\r\nforestry. The men were supposed to be masters of the two branches, i.e.,\r\nto be familiar with the technique of the hunt and of forestry\r\n(_Hirschgerecht_ and _Holzgerecht_). The higher positions were usually\r\nreserved to the nobility until (during the 18th century) the Cameralists\r\ncame into control of the administration; and with them, under the\r\nmercantilistic teachings, the apparatus of officials also increased.\r\n\r\nThese men usually possessed wide, but not deep knowledge of matters\r\nbearing upon their charges. In Prussia, in 1740, the forest service was\r\nat least in part combined with the military service, Frederick the Great\r\ninstituting the corps of riding couriers for the carrying of dispatches\r\nwho were selected from the forest service, an institution which persists\r\nup to date in the corps of _Feldjaeger_, while the sons of foresters\r\nwere enlisted in a troop known as _Fussjaeger_ (_chasseurs_). A new era\r\ndates from the middle of the 18th century when the connection with the\r\nhunt, the military organization, and the preferred position of the\r\nnobility, were at least in part abrogated, and a more technical\r\norganization was attempted. The cause for this change was the increase\r\nof wood prices, which made a more technical management desirable, and\r\nalso a decrease in the passion for the hunt. Still, although the forests\r\nin Bavaria were declared, in 1780 to 1790, to be of more importance than\r\nthe hunt, and the two services were distinctly separated, the head of\r\nthe hunt still ranked above the head of the forest service.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia, the professional men became early independent and\r\ninfluential, and by 1770, an organization had been perfected which\r\nexcelled in thoroughness and simplicity. The salaries of the foresters\r\nconsisted originally mainly in a free house, use of land and pasture\r\nrights, their uniform, and incidental emoluments, such as a toll for the\r\ndesignation of timber etc. Later, when everywhere else a regular money\r\nmanagement had been introduced, the absence of a cash income and general\r\npoverty forced the foresters to steal and extort; and the bad reputation\r\nestablished in the last part of the 18th century, as well as the bad\r\npractice, persisted until the 19th century. The lower grades in the\r\nservice were exceedingly ignorant, and their social position,\r\nconsequently, very low. Their main business was, indeed, simple, and\r\nconsisted in the booking of the cut, issuing permits for the removal and\r\nthe sale of wood, and looking after police functions in the woods. Yet,\r\nby 1781, we find regular planting plans submitted in the Prussian\r\nadministration, and, in 1787, felling plans are on record.\r\n\r\nThe administration of justice against offenders in the forests was until\r\nthe end of the 18th century in charge of the head foresters, and only\r\nthen was transferred to law officers. Theft of wood, as in olden days,\r\nwas considered as a smaller offense than other thefts, except if it was\r\ncut wood. In the beginning of the period, the judge had wide latitude as\r\nto amount of the fine to be imposed, but in the 17th century more\r\nprecise fines were fixed, and in the 18th century, a revision of the\r\nfines brought them into proportion with the value of the stolen wood; a\r\nchoice of punishments by fines, imprisonment or labor in the woods was\r\nthen also instituted.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. _Forestry Education._\r\n\r\nThe course of education for the foresters until the middle of the 18th\r\ncentury was a simple one and mainly directed to learning the\r\nmanipulations of the chase, training of dogs, tending of horses, setting\r\nof nets, shooting, etc. Two or three years’ life with a practical hunter\r\nwere followed by journeying and working for different employers,\r\nwoodlore being picked up by the way from those that knew.\r\n\r\nWhen in the 18th century the need for better woods knowledge became\r\npressing, the few really good forest managers were sought out by the\r\nyoung men who wished to secure this knowledge. In this way, a number of\r\nso-called “master-schools” came into existence, each depending on one\r\nman. Such a school was that of v. Zanthier in Wernigerode, later\r\ntransferred to Ilsenburg, started in 1763 and ending with his death in\r\n1778. Theoretical teaching and opportunity for practical demonstration\r\nhere was such that even students from the Berlin school and men in\r\nactual employment attended the courses.\r\n\r\nThe two great masters and fathers of modern forestry, Hartig and Cotta,\r\neach instituted such master-schools, the former in 1789, and the latter\r\nin 1785. Cotta’s school was afterwards transferred to Tharandt and\r\nbecame a State institution.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the State in forestry education found first expression\r\nin Prussia in a course of lectures in botany, later also in forest\r\neconomy, given to the forest officials by _Gleditsch_, professor of\r\nbotany at the University of Berlin (1770), to which was added a\r\npracticum at Tegel under Burgsdorf, who finally became the head of this\r\nmixed State school, and continued in this position until at his death,\r\nin 1802, the school was discontinued.\r\n\r\nIn imitation of this move by Prussia, a military planting school was\r\ninstituted by Württemberg at Solitude in 1770. The most noteworthy\r\nfeature of this school, which under various changes lasted less than 25\r\nyears, was the course of lectures by Stahl, mentioned before.\r\n\r\nBesides this higher school, a lower grade school was started in 1783,\r\nbut its career was even briefer, not more than ten years.\r\n\r\nBavaria organized a forest school at Munich in 1790 with a four years’\r\ncourse, and at least three years’ study at this school was required of\r\nthose seeking employment in the State service; but without having ever\r\nflourished, this school, too, collapsed by 1803.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. _Forestry Literature._\r\n\r\nThe oldest forestry literature of this period is contained in the many\r\nforest ordinances, which allow us to judge from their prescriptions as\r\nto the conditions of the practice in the woods and as to the gradual\r\naccumulation of empiric knowledge. Of a forestry science one could\r\nhardly speak until an attempt had been made to organize the knowledge\r\nthus empirically acquired into a systematic presentation, and this was\r\nnot done until the middle or last half of the 18th century.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts at a literary presentation of the empiric knowledge\r\nare found in the encyclopædic volumes of the so-called “Hausväter”\r\n(household fathers--domestic economists), who treated in a most diffuse\r\nmanner of agriculture in all its aspects, including silviculture.\r\n\r\nA number of these tomes appeared during the 17th century; the best and\r\nmost influential being published at the very beginning of that century\r\n(1595-1609), written by a preacher from Silesia, _Johann Colerus_, and\r\nentitled _Oeconomia ruralis et domestica, worin das ampt aller braven\r\nHausväter und Hausmütter begriffen_.\r\n\r\nColerus relied upon home experience and not, as Petrus de Crescentiis in\r\nhis earlier work, _Praedium rusticum_ (translated from the French, in\r\n1592), had done, upon the scholastic expositions of the Italians. He was\r\nrewarded by the popularity of his work which went through thirteen\r\neditions and became very widely known.\r\n\r\nSomewhat earlier, a jurist, _Noë Meurer_, wrote a book on forest law and\r\nhunting (second edition, 1576), which on this field remained long an\r\nauthority, and gives insight into the condition of forest use at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBut the first independent work on forestry, divorced from the hunt and\r\nfarming, did not appear until 1713, _Sylvicultura œconomica_, written\r\nby the Saxon director of mines, _Hans Carl v. Carlowitz_.\r\n\r\nThis book, while containing quaint and amusing ideas, gives many correct\r\nrules for silvicultural methods, especially as regards planting and\r\nsowing, but the subject of forest management or organization is entirely\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time (1710) a forest official, _v. Göchhausen_,\r\npublished _Notabilia venatoris_, which, however, contained little more\r\nthan a description of the species of trees and methods of their\r\nutilization.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the 18th century great activity began in the\r\nliterary field. This was carried on by two distinct classes of writers,\r\nnamely, the empiricists and the cameralists. The former--the\r\n_holzgerechte Jäger_--were the “practical” men of the woods who proved\r\nin many directions most unpractical, and exhibited in their writings,\r\noutside of the record of their limited experience, the crassest\r\nignorance. The cameralists were educated in law and political economy\r\nand, while lacking practical contact with the woodswork, tried to sift\r\nand systematize the knowledge of the empiricists, and to secure for it a\r\ntangible basis.\r\n\r\nSome five or six of the empiricists deserve notice as writers; the first\r\nand most noted of them was _Doebel_ (_Heinrich Wilhelm_) whose book,\r\n_Jägerpraktica_ (hunters’ practice), published in 1746, remained an\r\nauthority until modern times for the part referring to the chase. The\r\nauthor was pre-eminently a hunter, who worked in various capacities in\r\nSaxony, a self-taught man with very little knowledge of natural history.\r\nBeing familiar mainly with broadleaf forest he condemned planting and\r\nthinning, but described quite well for his time the methods of survey,\r\nsubdivision, estimating and measuring, and the methods of selection\r\nforest and coppice with standards. His ignorance is characterized by his\r\nreference to the “sulphurous and nitric elements of the soil” as cause\r\nof spontaneous forest fires.\r\n\r\nOpinionated and one-sided, like many so-called practical men, he came\r\ninto polemic controversies with other practitioners, not less\r\nopinionated, among them _J. G. Beckmann_, who worked in another part of\r\nSaxony, where, having to deal with coniferous woods, he had gathered\r\ndifferent experiences from those of Doebel. Although he was himself\r\npoorly educated, especially in natural sciences, he complained of the\r\nignorance of the foresters, and in his book (_Anweisung zu einer\r\npfleglichen Forstwirthschaft_, 1759), used for the first time the word\r\n_Forstwissenschaft_ (forest science), and insisted upon the necessity of\r\nstudying nature.\r\n\r\nHe may be credited with having really advanced forest organization by\r\ndevising the first good volume division method, and silviculture by\r\nadvocating the method of clearing followed by sowing.\r\n\r\nThe first practical forester with a university education was _J. J.\r\nBüchting_, who worked in the Harz mountains. His main interest lay in\r\nthe direction of survey, division and orderly utilization. He did not,\r\nhowever, make any striking advance, except that he gave equal standing\r\nto both planting and sowing.\r\n\r\nThe two most eminent practitioners of the period, however, active during\r\nthe middle of the century, were _Johann Georg von Langen_ and his\r\npupil, _Hans Dietrich von Zanthier_, both of noble family, and better\r\neducated than most of their contemporaries, and both engaged in the\r\norganization and management of Harz mountain forests, namely, those of\r\nthe Duke of Brunswick and of the Count of Stolberg-Wernigerode.\r\n\r\nThe former, without occupying himself directly with literary work, laid\r\ndown in his expert reports and in his working plans many instructions\r\nwhich form the basis for orderly management and silviculture far ahead\r\nof the times. Zanthier, writing considerably (especially _Kurzer\r\nsystematischer Grundriss der praktischen Forstwissenschaft_, 1764), is\r\nalso notable as the founder of the first forestry school (at\r\nWernigerode), 1763.\r\n\r\nAnother of this class of better educated practitioners, and co-worker\r\nwith the former two, was _von Lassberg_, who in 1764-1777 organized the\r\nSaxon forests.\r\n\r\nAn interesting incident in the life of the last three men is their\r\njourney to Denmark and Norway, whither they were called to organize the\r\nmanagement of the forests connected with the mines.\r\n\r\nAnother prominent forest manager of the last half of the century, whose\r\nliterary work is to be found only in various excellent official\r\ninstructions, among which is one for the teaching of foresters, was the\r\nhead of the Hessian forest service, a nobleman, _v. Berlepsch_.\r\n\r\nOf the cameralists who helped to make forestry literature, six or seven\r\ndeserve mention. These, men of education and polyhistors, were either at\r\nthe head of affairs, or else professors at universities, where they\r\nincluded forestry as one of the branches of political economy.\r\n\r\nThe credit of the first really systematic presentation of forestry\r\nprinciples and rules, as developed at the time, belongs to _Wilhelm\r\nGottfried von Moser_, a pupil of von Langen, who served in various\r\nprincipalities, and finally with the Prince of Taxis. In his _Principles\r\nof Forest Economy_, published in 1757, which for the first time brought\r\nout the economic importance of the subject, he discusses in two volumes\r\ndivided into nine chapters the different branches of forestry.\r\n\r\nA mining engineer, _J. A. Cramer_, came next with a very notable book,\r\n“_Anleitung zum Forstwesen_” (1766), which, although not as\r\ncomprehensive as Moser’s, treats the subject of silviculture very well.\r\n\r\nEqual in arrogance and opinionated self-satisfaction to any of the\r\nempiricists with whom he frequently crossed swords, was the Brunswick\r\ncouncillor, _von Brocke_, who, as an amateur, practising forestry on his\r\nown estate, developed the characteristic trait of the empiricists,\r\nnamely, a profound belief in his own infallibility. He produced, besides\r\nmany polemic writings, in which he charged the whole class of foresters\r\nwith ignorance, laziness and dishonesty, a magnum opus in four volumes,\r\nentitled “_True bases of the physical and experimental general science\r\nof forestry_,” which is an olla podrida of small value.\r\n\r\nLess original, but more fair and well informed, a typical representative\r\nof the cameralists, was _J. F. Stahl_, finally head of the forest\r\nadministration of Württemberg, and at the same time lecturer on\r\nmathematics, natural history and forestry at the forest school of\r\nSolitude (Stuttgart). Although an amateur in the field of forestry, he\r\nwas a good teacher and left many valuable and wise prescriptions evolved\r\nduring his administration.\r\n\r\nHe compiled in four volumes a dictionary of forest, fish and game\r\npractice (_Onomatologia forestalis-piscatoria-venatoria_, 1772-1781) and\r\nfounded the first forestry journal.\r\n\r\nSince 1770, forestry courses had been given for the cameralists at most\r\nof the German universities, and many of the professors prepared\r\ntextbooks for the purpose. At least three of these professors deserve\r\nmention, Beckman, Jung and Trunk.\r\n\r\nThe first, _J. Beckman_, professor of political economy at Göttingen,\r\none of the most noted cameralists, was author of a work in forty-five\r\nvolumes on the _Principles of German Agriculture_ (1769), in which he\r\ndevotes sixty-one pages to forestry, giving a complete system of\r\nforestry, with extracts from all known forestry writings.\r\n\r\n_J. H. Jung_, who gave a special course on forestry at the Kameralschule\r\nof Lautern, published a textbook in 1781 in which forest botany was well\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\n_J. J. Trunk_, who was Oberforstmeister in Austria, as well as professor\r\nat Freiburg, was the most prominent of the three, and wrote a\r\ncomprehensive work full of practical sense (_Neues vollständiges\r\nForstlehrbuch oder systematische Grundsätze des Forstrechtes, der\r\nForstpolizei und Forstökonomie, nebst Anhang von ausländischen\r\nHolzarten, von Torf und Steinkohlen_, 1789).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile at first the ephemeral writings, especially the polemic ones of\r\nthe empiricists, found room in literary and cameralistic magazines, the\r\nneed of a professional journal first found expression in 1763, in\r\nStahl’s _Allgemeines ökonomisches Forstmagazin_, which ran into twelve\r\nvolumes, and contains many articles important to the history of\r\nforestry, and is especially rich in its references to foreign\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nTwo continuations of the magazine under different editorships were of\r\nless value. But von Moser’s _Forstarchiv_, running from 1788 to 1807\r\nwith its thirty volumes, is an authority and a historical source of the\r\nfirst rank.\r\n\r\nA very characteristic literature of the last half of the 18th century\r\nconsisted in _forest calendars_ in which advice as to monthly and\r\nseasonal procedures in the forest were given, Beckman and Zanthier being\r\namong the authors.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. DEVELOPMENT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nThe last hundred years or so has seen in Germany the development of\r\nfully established forest policies and the complete organization of\r\nstable forest administrations, based upon thorough and careful\r\nrecognition of the principles of forest management and intensive\r\napplication of silvicultural methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Changes in Property Conditions._\r\n\r\nThe change in forest treatment from that prevailing during the previous\r\nperiod was mainly due to the change in property conditions, and\r\nespecially to the establishment of _state forests_. This change was\r\nlargely the result of the revolutionary movements at the beginning of\r\nthe new century which brought about changes in state organizations. In\r\nPrussia, the princely forest property had been declared state domain in\r\n1713, but elsewhere, the public domain had been considered the property\r\nof the princes in their capacity as head of the country, as _domanium_,\r\noutside of their personal private property (Chatullgüter). The income\r\nfrom this _domanium_ was in part liable to be applied to the expenses of\r\nthe court and of the administration of the realm, to some extent\r\nalleviating the burdens of taxation. This property arose from a variety\r\nof relations which have been discussed at length in the foregoing\r\nchapters. It was derived mainly from feudal properties, fiefs of\r\nvassalage and fiefs of official position, secularized church property\r\nand other forfeited property, division of mark forests, and from\r\nallodial possessions of the family. Gradually, by agreement with the\r\nlanded estates, it was understood that this property could not be\r\ndisposed of or dissipated by the prince, and was inherited by the eldest\r\nson together with the princely dignity, being an attribute of his\r\nposition in the state. In the reconstruction period of 1806 to 1815,\r\nduring and after the Napoleonic wars, many of the small princes lost\r\ntheir seigniorage (Landeshoheit _ipso jure_), and with the loss of the\r\nprincely dignity, the obligation of carrying the expense of court and\r\nadministration naturally falling away, these properties became in most\r\ncases purely individual property of the former princes.\r\n\r\nNot, however, until the revolutionary movements of 1848 and even later,\r\nwas this divorce of the state idea from that of the person of the prince\r\neverywhere accomplished, nor was it carried through without many\r\nbickerings and quarrels between the princes and the representatives of\r\nthe people, who claimed this _domanium_ for the state. In the larger\r\nstates, all this domanial property was finally declared state lands,\r\nwhile in the smaller principalities a partition of the land between the\r\nprinces and the state took place, or else a relation was established by\r\nwhich a part of the revenue resulting from the state lands was secured\r\nto the princes.\r\n\r\nAn increase of the State’s property came also during the first decade of\r\nthe century through the abolishment of cloisters and secularization of\r\nchurch property generally, the lands of both Protestant and Catholic\r\nchurch institutions being taken by the State.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, at the same time that the idea of state forest was\r\nbeing realized, the changes in economic thought which brought the\r\nprinciple of individualism to the fore gave rise to a movement to sell\r\nthe state properties. This movement was inspired by French doctrines,\r\nwhose influence was at the time very strong, by the teachings of Adam\r\nSmith who held that the state is not fit to conduct business, and by\r\nthe hope that in private ownership an improvement in forest conditions\r\nwould be more readily realized. These ideas by themselves would,\r\nprobably, not have led to the adoption of a policy of sale if it had not\r\nbeen for the need for cash which, as a result of the French wars, was\r\nfelt everywhere during the first years of the decade. The sale of this\r\nproperty seemed to provide a ready means for States to secure funds.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia, after the collapse of 1806, this measure was widely\r\ndiscussed, and eventually, in 1810 to 1813, repeatedly instructions for\r\nthe sale of state forest property were issued. There were to be excluded\r\nfrom such sales only large complexes of forest, those on the sea coast,\r\nsand dunes and river fronts, where the protection of the forest cover\r\nwas needed, and those which it was desirable to maintain for the use of\r\nimportant industrial establishments. Only the accession of Hartig\r\n(1811), as chief of the forest administration which was a branch of the\r\nTreasury department, prevented the execution of this dismemberment. It\r\nwas due to him that the difference in character between farm and forest\r\nproperty began to be recognized. Although, after 1820, sales of forest\r\nproperty took place, they were never a fiscal measure, but were made\r\neither for the purpose of rounding off existing state forest property or\r\npaying off servitudes, or else in order to turn over agricultural soil\r\nto farm use. At present everywhere in Germany state properties are on\r\nthe increase.\r\n\r\nThe property conditions of the _communal forests_ naturally changed also\r\nwith the political changes of the 19th century, when existing\r\ncommunities were made part of the large political machine and changed\r\nfrom economic and social to modern political municipalities. The\r\nownership conditions, however, were not simplified, but as before,\r\nremained extremely varied.\r\n\r\nOf the Mark forest but a very small portion remains to-day. The majority\r\nof it had been finally divided among the Märker in the first decade of\r\nthe century, and the few remaining parts became independent of the\r\npolitical organization and now exist merely in the form of appurtenances\r\nto certain farm property known as _Genossenwald_ (association forests).\r\nIn addition to the variety of communal ownerships existing in the\r\npreceding period, some new communal properties originated from the\r\ngranting of land in the settlement and dissolution of servitudes,\r\nwhereby an undivided property (_Interessentenwald_) in which sometimes\r\neven the state retains an interest, came into existence.\r\n\r\nThe municipal property of the cities had become either the property of\r\nthe entire community or of that part which constituted the real\r\ncitizenship, or at least of a certain class of citizens of the\r\nmunicipality.\r\n\r\nThe incumbrances which had grown up with regard to forest property under\r\nthe name of _servitudes_ and which so much retarded the development of\r\nbetter forest management continued into this period, and although\r\nthrough the influences of the French revolution a desire had been\r\nstimulated to get rid of all curtailments of property, some have\r\npersisted to this day. Indeed, for a time an increase of these\r\nservitudes took place, due to the carelessness of forest officials in\r\nkeeping unjustified use of the forest in check, when ancient usage of\r\nthese rights of user was claimed and new servitudes were established.\r\n\r\nIn Bavaria, it became at last necessary (1852) to positively forbid the\r\nfurther establishment of new servitudes or rights of user. Laws having\r\nin view the dissolution or buying out of these rights were issued in\r\nBavaria in 1805, and in Prussia in 1821, giving the right to forest\r\nowners whose properties were so encumbered, to call for a division of\r\ninterests; but as at first the only way to settlement was by exchange\r\nfor definite parcels of forest property, the progress in the abolishment\r\nof these rights was slow, until money exchange was permitted (as in\r\nSaxony, 1832). At the present time, the state forest administrations\r\nhave mostly got rid of these servitudes, or at least have progressed so\r\nfar in their regulation that they are now rarely impediments to forest\r\nmanagement. These peaceable adjustments of the rights of user constitute\r\nthe last act of freeing property socially and economically.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Forest Conditions._\r\n\r\nIn spite of the sporadic efforts which had been made to bring about the\r\nrecuperation of forest areas during the 18th century, the conditions of\r\nthe forest at the beginning of the new century were most pitiable; the\r\ndivision of the Mark, by which the peasants became individual owners,\r\nprofited little, and led to devastation rather than to improving the\r\ncondition of the property. In addition, export trade in wood had become\r\nbrisk, and the financial depression, a result of the French wars, led to\r\nincreased exploitations, which, with the improvement in means of\r\ntransportation, progressed to the more distant forest areas, and\r\nenlarged the waste area. Especially in the more densely populated parts\r\nof the country, the deforested area widened, and large wastes with poor\r\nyoung growth increased in all directions, in the same manner as now in\r\nthe United States. The alarmists had good cause for renewing their\r\ncries, and, around the year 1800, a considerable literature sprung up on\r\nthe subject of the threatened timber famine.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that at that time the Catalpa played a role,\r\nat least on paper, as it does in our own day, being recommended as the\r\nonly means of staving off the timber famine. A renewed _betulomania_\r\nspread widely over the country. In North Germany especially, great\r\nefforts were made to replant the denuded areas and to change the coppice\r\nareas, fit only for firewood, to coniferous species, pine, etc., by\r\nwhich eventually a great change in the forest type from the original\r\nmixed forest to the pure forest was effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Personnel._\r\n\r\nThe great change which led to improved conditions, during the first half\r\nof the century, was pre-eminently due to the knowledge and intelligence\r\nof a group of men, six in number, competent foresters, who combined the\r\nhigh grade education of the Cameralists with the practitioners’\r\nknowledge: Hartig, Cotta, Hundeshagen, Koenig, Pfeil and Heyer. These\r\nmen built, to be sure, on the shoulders of their precursors of the\r\ncentury in which they were born, but, being placed in authoritative\r\npositions, found better opportunities for putting their teachings into\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThe first two mentioned were older than the rest, and are usually\r\ndescribed as the “fathers of modern forestry.” Born about a year apart,\r\nboth educated at universities, they excelled in both scientific and\r\npractical directions.\r\n\r\n_Georg Ludwig Hartig_ (1764-1837), studied at the University of Giessen\r\nand, after having served in various functions in various parts of\r\nSouthern Germany, became, in 1811, head of the Prussian forest\r\nadministration. He was equally eminent as a practical man and organizer,\r\nas a writer, and as a teacher. In literary direction his work lay not so\r\nmuch in developing new ideas as in formulating clearly the known ones,\r\nas evidenced in his celebrated “General Rules” in silviculture.\r\n\r\nNot less than thirty separate publications attest his assiduity. Among\r\nthem stands pre-eminent “_Anweisung zur Holzzucht für Foerster_” (1791;\r\n8th edition, 1818). As a teacher he began his work by establishing a\r\nmasterschool (1789-1791) at Hungen, transferred to Stuttgart in 1807;\r\nand afterwards, as head of the Prussian forest administration, he\r\nlectured at the University of Berlin, continuing his lectures there,\r\neven after the forestry school at Eberswalde had been established, until\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nHe may be considered as having established on a firm basis the forest\r\nadministration of Prussia; and many of the things he instituted still\r\nprevail. In organizing the service, he introduced fixed salaries, he\r\nrelieved the foresters from financial responsibilities, transferring all\r\nhandling of money to a separate set of officials, whereby the temptation\r\nto fraudulent practice of graft was removed, and he issued instructions\r\nfor the different grades of foresters; and every part of this work was\r\nall his own. In regulating the forest area of the state he developed the\r\nvolume allotment method, which, however, proved too cumbersome to be\r\nreadily applied to large areas. Toward the end of his life, his work was\r\nnot entirely successful, and he lost prestige in his later years.\r\n\r\n_Heinrich von Cotta_ (1763-1844) studied at the University of Jena, and\r\nafterwards practiced in Thuringia, where he established a master school\r\nat Zillbach (1795). In 1811, he was called to Saxony, as director of\r\nforest surveys, whither he also transferred his school, at Tharandt,\r\nwhich in 1816 was made a state institution and is still flourishing. In\r\nthat year he was made the director of the Bureau of Forest Management.\r\nLike Hartig, he was eminent in the three directions of practical,\r\nliterary, and educational work, but he excelled Hartig in originality,\r\ndeveloping new principles and thought. Being a good plant-physiologist\r\nand observer of nature, he developed new ideas in silviculture,\r\nespecially with reference to methods of thinning, and his “_Anweisung\r\nzum Waldbau_,” written in the simplest, clearest and most forceful\r\nmanner, forms a classic worthy of study to this day. In the field of\r\nforest management he became the inventor of the area allotment method\r\nand the originator of the highly developed Saxon forest management. As\r\na teacher he excelled in clearness, exposition, wealth of ideas and\r\ngeniality.\r\n\r\nOf an entirely different stamp was the third of the great masters,\r\n_Johann Christian Hundeshagen_ (1783-1834), who having studied in\r\nHeidelberg, became after some years of practice, professor of forestry\r\nat Tuebingen, in 1817, and at Giessen, 1825. He was a representative of\r\nthe theoretical or philosophical side of forestry, being highly\r\ncultivated and imbued with the spirit of science. His bent was to\r\nsystematize the knowledge in existence and extend it by means of exact\r\nexperiments. In forest organization, he invented the well known formula\r\nmethod or “rational method” of regulating felling budgets and became\r\nalso one of the founders of Forest Statics (1826) which he called “the\r\ndoctrine of measuring forestal forces,” being thus the forerunner of\r\nmodern scientific forestry.\r\n\r\nThe fourth of the group, _Gottlob König_ (1776-1849), was a practitioner\r\nwithout a university education, who had enjoyed the teaching and\r\ninfluence of Cotta whom he succeeded in Eisenach as the head of the\r\nducal forest administration. He also founded here a private forest\r\nschool, which, in 1830, became a state institution, and is still in\r\nexistence. König became noted by his contributions to the scientific,\r\nespecially the mathematical side of forestry, developing forest\r\nmensuration and statics. In this latter branch he was the forerunner of\r\nPressler and of the modern school of finance. In his “_Anleitung zur\r\nHolztaxation_” (1813) he gives a complete account of forest mensuration\r\nand in the part devoted to forest valuation he develops the first soil\r\nrent formula and the methods of determining the cost value of stands.\r\nHis “Forest Mathematics” (1835) in which he introduces factors of form\r\nand many other new ideas was an original contribution to science.\r\n\r\nVery different in character from these four leaders was the aggressive,\r\nsharp-witted _Friedrich Wilhelm Leopold Pfeil_ (1783-1859), who, without\r\na university education, and in spite of his poor knowledge of\r\nmathematics and natural history, advanced himself by native wit and\r\ngenius. After a brief period of employment in private service, in the\r\nprovince of Silesia, he accepted the position of professor of forestry\r\nat the Berlin University, in 1821, in connection with Hartig, with whom,\r\nhowever, he was at sword’s point. It was at his instigation, with the\r\nassistance of von Humboldt, that the school was transferred, in 1830, to\r\nEberswalde, Pfeil becoming its director.\r\n\r\nWhile Hartig was a generalizer, Pfeil was an individualizer, free from\r\ndogma, and most suggestive; a free lance and a fighter. Critical in the\r\nextreme and prolific in his literary work, he domineered the forestry\r\nliterature of the day by means of his _Kritische Blaetter_, a journal of\r\nmuch import and merit.\r\n\r\nThe youngest of the group, _Karl Heyer_ (1797-1856), a thoroughly\r\neducated man, combined the professorial position in the University of\r\nGiessen (1835) with practical management of a forest district, but in\r\n1834 abandoned the latter in order to devote himself entirely to\r\nliterary work. He was one of the clearest and most systematic\r\nexpounders, and both his _Waldbau_ (silviculture, 1854) and his\r\n_Waldertragsregelung_ (forest organization, 1841) are classics. The\r\nlast, fifth edition of the Waldbau, appearing in 1906 in two volumes,\r\nhas been brought up to date by Professor Hess. He devised one of the\r\nmost rational methods of forest organization, and, imbued with the\r\nnecessity of basing forest management on exact scientific inquiry,\r\ninstead of on empiricism alone, he formulated instructions for forest\r\nstatic investigations, a subject which his son, Gustav Heyer, elaborated\r\ninto a science.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Progress in Silviculture._\r\n\r\n_Natural regeneration_ continued to be the favorite method well into\r\nthis period, and, for a long time, selection forest and coppice were all\r\nthat was known in practice until Hartig and Cotta forced recognition of\r\nthe shelterwood system.\r\n\r\nThe only way in which a transition from the generally practiced,\r\nunregulated selection forest to an intensive management was possible,\r\nwith the ignorant personnel of underforesters, was to formulate into an\r\neasily intelligible prescription the necessary rules, allowing the least\r\nplay to individual judgment. This was done by Hartig when he formulated\r\nhis eight “General Rules” (1808) which coincided also closely with the\r\nteachings of Cotta. Since these rules represent in brief and most\r\ndefinitely the status of silvicultural knowledge on natural regeneration\r\nat the time, it may be desirable to translate them _verbatim_.\r\n\r\n(1) “Every forest tree which is expected to propagate itself by natural\r\nregeneration must be old enough to bear good seed.\r\n\r\n(2) “Every district or stand which is to be replaced by a thoroughly\r\nperfect stand by means of natural regeneration, must be brought into\r\nsuch position (density) that the soil may everywhere receive sufficient\r\nseeding.\r\n\r\n(3) “Each compartment must be kept in such condition (density) that it\r\ncannot, before the seeding takes place, grow up to grass and weeds.\r\n\r\n(4) “With species whose seed loses its power of germination through\r\nfrost, as is the case with the oak and beech, the compartments must be\r\ngiven such a position (density) that the foliage which after the fall of\r\nseed covers and protects the same cannot be carried away by wind.\r\n\r\n(5) “All stands must be given such density that the germinating plants\r\nin the same, as long as they are still tender, find sufficient\r\nprotection from their mother trees against heat of the sun and against\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n(6) “So soon as the young stand resulting from natural regeneration does\r\nnot any longer require this motherly protection, it must gradually,\r\nthrough the careful removal of the mother trees, be accustomed to the\r\nweather, and finally must be entirely brought into the open position.\r\n\r\n(7) “All the young growths, whether secured by natural or artificial\r\nseeding, must be freed from the accompanying less useful species and\r\nfrom weeds, if these in spite of all precaution threaten the better\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\n(8) “From every young forest until it is full grown, the suppressed wood\r\nmust be removed from time to time, so that the trees which are ahead or\r\ndominate may grow the better; the upper perfect crown cover, however,\r\nmust not be interrupted until it is the intention to grow a new forest\r\nagain in the place of the old one.”\r\n\r\nSince these rules are applicable only in beech forests, much mischief\r\nand misconception resulted from their generalization; pure, even-aged\r\nhigh forests became the ideal, and the mixed forest, which was\r\noriginally the most widespread condition, vanished to a large extent.\r\nThis was especially unfortunate in Northern and Northeastern pine\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nA reaction against Hartig’s generalization began about 1830, under the\r\nlead of Pfeil. He had at first agreed with Hartig, and then with equal\r\nnarrowness advocated for many years a clear cutting system with\r\nartificial reforestation. Finally, however, he was not afraid to\r\nacknowledge that his early generalizations in this respect were a\r\nmistake, and that different conditions required different treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the development of the shelterwood system there was at first, under\r\nthe lead of Hartig, a tendency to open up rather sharply, taking out\r\nabout three-fourths of the existing stand, but gradually he became\r\nconvinced that this was too much, and finally reduced the first removal\r\nto only about one-third of the stand. This was the origin of his\r\nnickname of _Dunkelman_. In spite of the fact that it was claimed that\r\nCotta took the opposite view (for which he was called _Lichtman_), he,\r\ntoo, grew to favor a dark position, and, as he progressed, leaned more\r\nand more towards more careful opening up. Hartig originally recognized\r\nonly three different fellings: the cutting for seed; the cutting for\r\nlight; and the removal cutting. By and by, a second cut was made during\r\nthe seed year, and the number of fellings to secure gradual removal were\r\nincreased, so that, by 1801, this system seems to have been pretty\r\nnearly perfected to its modern conditions. The best exposition of this\r\n_Femelschlagbetrieb_ (shelterwood system), as then developed, is to be\r\nfound in Karl Heyer’s Handbook, 1854.\r\n\r\nThe method was unfortunately extended by Burgsdorf (1787) to the\r\nNorthern pineries with a seventy year period of rotation. Within ten\r\nyears, however, he recognized its inappropriateness, and modified it by\r\ninstructions to leave only six to twelve seed trees per acre. His\r\nsuccessor, Kropff, reduced the number of seed trees to four or five,\r\nwhich were to be removed within two or three years. In spite of the\r\ndevelopment of this more rational method, the practitioners under\r\nHartig’s approval, held mainly to a dark position even for pine, much in\r\nthe manner of a selection forest, which produced a poor growth of\r\noppressed seedlings, retarding for a long time the development of the\r\npineries.\r\n\r\nIn spruce or fir, either a pure selection forest or a strip system was\r\nemployed. Attempts at a shelterwood system were made, but experience\r\nwith the wind danger soon taught the lesson that this was not a proper\r\nmethod with shallow-rooted species. Even Hartig preferred for spruce\r\nclearing and planting, and this is still the most favored method with\r\nthat species. For the deep-rooted and shade-enduring fir the shelterwood\r\nmethod with a long regeneration period was thoroughly established in\r\nthe Black Forest, and in Württemberg by 1818.\r\n\r\nNatural regeneration being the main method of reproduction until the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century, _artificial_ means, as is evident from\r\nthe forest ordinances of Prussia and Bavaria (1812 and 1814), were\r\nusually applied only to repair fail-places, or to plant up wastes. In\r\nthis artificial reforestation, with the exception of the planting of oak\r\nin pastures, sowing was almost entirely resorted to because it could be\r\ndone cheaper and easier, but as the sowings were mostly made on\r\nunprepared soil and with very large amounts of seed (30 to 60 pounds per\r\nacre, now only 7 to 10 pounds), the results were not satisfactory,\r\neither because the seed did not find favorable conditions for\r\ngerminating, or when germinated the stand was too dense.\r\n\r\nPlanting, if done at all, was done only with wildlings dug from the\r\nwoods, and usually, following the practice of the planting of oak in\r\npastures, with saplings: the plant material was too large for success.\r\nNurseries, except for oak, were not known, even to Cotta in 1817; and\r\nHeyer, having to plant up several thousand acres, still relied on\r\nwildlings, two to three years old, which he took up with a ball of earth\r\nby means of his “hole spade,” a circular spade re-invented by him and\r\nmuch praised by others. Hartig, in 1833, still advised the use of four\r\nto five year old pine wildlings, root-pruned, but, eventually, having\r\nmet with poor success, for which he was much discredited, came to the\r\nconclusion that un-pruned two-year-old plants were preferable.\r\n\r\nThe credit of having radically changed these practices belongs to Pfeil,\r\nwho, entirely reversing his position, advocated for pine forest a system\r\nof clearing followed by sowing, or by planting of wildlings with a ball\r\nof earth. Then, suggesting that possibly planting without this\r\nprecaution could be attempted, and pointing out the necessity of\r\nsecuring a satisfactory root system, he recommended, about 1830, the use\r\nof one-year-old seedlings grown in carefully prepared seed beds. While\r\nfor securing these, he relied upon the simple preparation of the soil by\r\nspading, _Biermans_ added the use of a fertilizer in the shape of the\r\nashes of burned sod. The method of growing pine seedlings and planting\r\nthem when one to three years old was further developed by _Butlar_\r\n(1845), who introduced the practice of dense sowing in the seed beds. He\r\nalso invented an ingenious planting iron or dibble, a half cone of iron,\r\nwhich was thrown by the planter with great precision, first to make a\r\nhole and then to close it. This was improved by the addition of a long\r\nhandle into the superior, well-known and much used _Wartenberg_ planting\r\ndibble. At the same time (1840), _Manteuffel_ devised the method known\r\nby his name of planting in mounds, which is especially applicable on wet\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1840 that transplanting of yearling pines with naked\r\nroots became general. The widespread application of this latter system\r\nresulted in abandoning to a large extent mixed growth, and led to the\r\nestablishment of pure pine forests, introducing thereby most intensively\r\nall the dangers incident to a clearing system and pure forest which are\r\navoided by the mixed forest, namely, insects, frost and drought.\r\n\r\nA practice of planting spruce in bunches, originally twelve to twenty\r\nplants in a bunch, had been in existence since 1780. This practice\r\nincreased until 1850, and is still in use in the Harz mountains and in\r\neastern Prussia, although the bunches have been reduced so as to contain\r\nonly from three to five plants, the object of the bunching being to make\r\nsure that one or the other of the plants should live. Much discussion as\r\nto the merits of this method took place between the old masters, Cotta\r\nfavoring the small bunches upon the basis of a successful plantation of\r\nhis own, Hartig and Pfeil opposing it, but finally weakening. Since\r\n1850, however, the practice of setting out single plants has become more\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nA reaction from the indiscriminate application of the shelterwood method\r\nto the hardwoods and of the clearing method to the pine set in during\r\nthe last quarter of the 19th century under the lead of Burkhardt and\r\nGayer. These advocated return to mixed forest and to natural\r\nregeneration with long periods, approaching a selection forest. Gayer\r\nespecially, professor of silviculture at Munich, became the foremost\r\napostle of this school. Yet even to this day, the principles of\r\nsilvicultural treatment under the many different conditions remain\r\nunsettled. On the whole however, with the financial question assiduously\r\nbrought forward, the clearing system has made most progress, and the\r\nselection system has nearly vanished, being replaced by the group method\r\nand the shelterwood system.\r\n\r\nA number of special forms of silvicultural management applicable under\r\nspecial conditions have been locally developed, without, however,\r\ngaining much ground and being mainly of historical value. Among these\r\nmay be mentioned _Seebach’s Modified Beech Forest_, which consists in\r\nopening up a beech stand so as to secure regeneration, merely to form a\r\nsoil cover, leaving enough of the old stand on the ground to close up in\r\nthirty or forty years. By this treatment the large increment due to open\r\nposition is secured without endangering the soil. Similarly the\r\n_Storied_ or _Two-aged High forest_, was applied to the management of\r\noak forest in mixture with beech. In a few localities also, on limited\r\nareas, a combination of forest and farming (_Waldfeldbau_) has been\r\ncontinued and elaborated, besides the more general use of coppice and\r\ncoppice with standards.\r\n\r\nAccording to the statistics for 1900 the following distribution of the\r\nacreage under different silvicultural methods prevailed throughout the\r\nempire:\r\n\r\n                           Deciduous  Coniferous\r\n                            Per cent.  Per cent.\r\n  Total Forest                32.5       67.5\r\n  High Forest                 18.4       60.1\r\n  Selection Forest             2.3        7.4\r\n  Coppice                      6.8        --\r\n  Coppice with standards       5.         --\r\n\r\nConiferous forest, of which 68% is pine and 30% spruce, prevails in\r\nEastern and Middle Germany, deciduous forest, of which 20% is oak, the\r\nbalance principally beech, in the West and South.\r\n\r\nCoppice and coppice with standards are mostly in private hands as well\r\nas the coniferous selection forest, the State forests being almost\r\nentirely high forest, i.e., seed forest, other than under selection\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Improving the Crop._ The credit of having first\r\nsystematically formulated the practice of thinnings under the name of\r\n_Durchforstung_ (for the first thinning), _Durchplenterung_ (for the\r\nlater thinnings), belongs to Hartig, although the practice of such\r\nthinnings had been known and applied here and there before his time. He\r\nconfined himself mainly to the removal of the undesirable species, dead\r\nand dying, suppressed and damaged trees, being especially emphatic in\r\nhis advice not to interrupt the crown cover. Excepting the early weeding\r\nor improvement cuttings, these thinnings were not to begin until the\r\nfiftieth to seventieth year in the broadleaved forest, but in conifers\r\nin the twentieth to thirtieth year.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to explain on a biological basis the process and\r\neffect of thinning was made by Späth in a special contribution (1802).\r\nCotta, in his Silviculture, although at first agreeing with Hartig,\r\nlater in his third edition (1821) changes his mind, and improves both\r\nupon the biological explanation of Späth and the practice of Hartig,\r\npointing out that the latter came too late with his assistance, that the\r\nstruggle between the individuals should be anticipated, and the thinning\r\nrepeated as soon as the branches begin to die; but he also recognizes\r\nthe practical difficulty of the application of this cultural measure on\r\naccount of the expense. Curiously enough, he recommends severer\r\nthinnings for fuel-wood production than for timber forests.\r\n\r\nPfeil accentuates the necessity of treating different sites and species\r\ndifferently in the practice of thinnings. Hundeshagen accentuates the\r\nfinancial result and the fact that the culmination of the average yield\r\nis secured earlier by frequent thinnings. Heyer formulates the “golden\r\nrule:” “Early, often, moderate,” but insists that first thinning should\r\nnot be made until the cost of the operation can be covered by the sale\r\nof the material. Propositions to base the philosophy and the results of\r\nthinning on experimental grounds rather than on mere opinion were made\r\nas early as 1825 to 1828, and again from 1839 to 1846, at various\r\nmeetings of forestry associations, until, in 1860, Brunswick and Saxony\r\ninaugurated the first more extensive experiments in thinnings. The two\r\nrepresentatives of forest finance, Koenig and Pressler, pointed out, in\r\n1842 to 1859, the great significance of thinnings in a finance\r\nmanagement as one of the most important silvicultural operations for\r\nsecuring the highest yield.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the advanced development of the theory of thinning, the\r\npractice has largely lagged behind, because of the impracticability of\r\nintroducing intensive management. Only lately, owing to improvement in\r\nprices and the possibility of marketing the inferior material profitably\r\nenough to justify the expenditure, has it become possible to secure more\r\ngenerally the advantages of the cultural effect. Within the last thirty\r\nor forty years, great activity has been developed among the experiment\r\nstations in securing a true basis for the practice of thinning.\r\n\r\nNew ideas were introduced through French influence and by others\r\nindependently in the latter part of the eighties, when the distinction\r\nbetween the final harvest crop (Fr. élite, le haut) and the nurse crop\r\n(le bas) was introduced.[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] The conception of such subdivision and the English nomenclature\r\n  was independently first employed by the writer in his Report for\r\n  1887, as Chief of Forestry Division, when discussing planting plans\r\n  for the prairies.\r\n\r\nThe physiological reasons for the practice of thinning upon experimental\r\nbasis, were advanced by the botanists Goeppert and R. Hartig, and among\r\nforesters, the names of Kraft, Lorey, Haug, Borggreve, Wagener, and\r\nothers are intimately connected with the very active discussion of the\r\nsubject lately going on in the magazines. Thinnings have become such an\r\nimportant part of the income of forest administrations (25 to 40% of the\r\ntotal yield) that the prominence given to the subject is well justified,\r\nand a more modern conception of the advantages of thinnings and\r\nespecially of severer thinnings is gaining ground.\r\n\r\nThe proposition, now much ventilated, of severe opening up near the end\r\nof the rotation, in order to secure an accelerated increment\r\n(_Lichtungshiebe_) is, however, much older; Hossfeld, in 1824, and Jäger\r\nin 1850, advocated this measure for financial reasons, while Koenig and\r\nPressler anticipated the development of an individual tree management by\r\npruning, and differentiation of final harvest and nurse crop, a method\r\nwhich is working itself out at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Methods of Forest Organization._\r\n\r\nAs stated before, to Hartig and Cotta belongs the credit of having\r\napplied systematically on a large scale methods of forest organization\r\nfor sustained yield; Hartig having been active in Prussia since 1811,\r\nand Cotta beginning to organize the Saxon forests in the same year. The\r\nmethod employed by Hartig, the so-called volume allotment, had been\r\nalready formulated and its foundation laid by Kregting and others\r\n(although Hartig seems to have claimed the invention). But it was\r\nreserved to Hartig to build up this method in its detail, and to\r\nformulate clearly and precisely its application, as well as to improve\r\nthe practice of forest survey, calculation of increment, and the making\r\nof yield tables. His method involved a survey, a subdivision, a\r\nconstruction of yield tables and the formulation of working plans, in\r\nwhich the principle according to which the forest was to be managed\r\nduring the whole rotation was laid down for each district. The rotation\r\nwas determined, divided into periods, finally of twenty years, and the\r\nperiodic volume yield represented by all stands was distributed through\r\nall the periods of the rotation in such a manner as to make the periodic\r\nfelling budgets approximately equal; or, since the tendency to increased\r\nwood consumption was recognized, an increase of the felling budget\r\ntoward the end of the rotation was considered desirable.\r\n\r\nCotta based his system of forest organization upon a method described by\r\na Bavarian, Schilcher (1796); it relied primarily upon area rather than\r\nvolume division. This method was later on (1817), called by him\r\n_Flaechenfachwerk_ (area allotment). It divides the rotation into\r\nperiods and allots areas for each periodic felling budget. But before\r\nthis time, in 1804, Cotta had himself formulated a method of his own,\r\nwhich combined the area and volume method, the volume being the main\r\nbasis and the area being merely used as a check. While Hartig\r\ndogmatically and persistently carried out his difficult scheme, Cotta\r\nwas open-minded enough to improve his method of regulation, and by 1820,\r\nin his _Anweisung zur Forst-Einrichtung und -Abschaetzung_, he comes to\r\nhis final position of basing the sustained yield entirely on the area\r\nallotment, using the estimate of volume simply to secure an\r\napproximately uniform felling budget. He laid particular stress on\r\norderly procedure in the subdivision and progress of the fellings. He\r\ndid not prepare an elaborate working plan binding for the entire\r\nrotation, but merely prescribed the principles of the general\r\nmanagement, and, after 1816, he confined the formulating of felling and\r\nplanting plans only to the next decade.\r\n\r\nA similar method, making a closer combination of volume and area\r\nallotment, now known as the combined allotment, in which the area forms\r\nthe main basis for distributing the felling budgets, was prescribed by\r\nKlipstein in 1833. This, also, confines the working plan to the first\r\nperiod of the rotation and for this period alone makes a rather careful\r\nstatement of the expected volume budget; a new budget is then to be\r\ndetermined at the beginning of the next period. This idea of confining\r\nthe budget determination to a comparatively short period is now\r\ngenerally accepted, the future receiving only summary consideration.\r\n\r\nThese methods of organization were the ones generally applied in\r\npractice, and are still with some modifications in practical use. About\r\n1820, however, new theories were advanced which led to the formulation\r\nof methods based upon the idea of the _normal forest_. The conception of\r\na normal forest, with a normal stock, distributed in normal age classes,\r\nso as to insure a sustained yield management, was evolved, in 1788, by\r\nan obscure anonymous official in the Tax-collector’s office of Austria,\r\ndesigned for assessing woods managed for sustained yield. This fertile\r\nidea, which is still the basis of forest organization in Austria, and\r\nexplains better than any other method the principles involved in forest\r\norganization, did not find entrance into forestry literature in all its\r\ndetail until 1811 when André compared this so-called _Cameraltaxe_ with\r\nHartig’s method of regulation. We find, however, that, simultaneously\r\nwith the Austrian invention of this method, Paulsen (1787) proposed to\r\ndetermine the felling budget as a relation between normal stock and\r\nnormal yield, and in his yield tables (the first of the kind, 1795), he\r\ngives the proportion of increment to normal stock in percentic relation,\r\nso that the felling budget may be either expressed as a fraction of the\r\nstock or as a per cent.; in beech forests, for instance, he determines\r\nthe felling budget as 3.3% on best sites, 2.5% on medium, and 1.8% on\r\npoor sites.\r\n\r\nProbably stimulated by André’s description, _Huber_ (1812) developed a\r\nmethod and formula which may be considered the foundation of the later\r\ndevelopment by Carl Heyer (Felling budget = I + ((Sa - Sn)/e)).\r\n\r\nBased upon the normal forest idea, a number of methods were elaborated\r\nwhich, because of their employing a mathematical formula for the\r\ndetermination of the felling budget, are known as _formula methods_;\r\nthey are, indeed modified rational volume divisions.\r\n\r\nHundeshagen has the merit of having first clearly explained the basis of\r\nthese methods, and himself developed a formula, of the correctness of\r\nwhich he was so convinced as to designate his method as “the rational”\r\none. Two other formulæ were brought into the world by Koenig\r\n(1838-1851), but the credit of the most complete elaboration both of the\r\nprinciples of the normal forest idea and of its practical application\r\nbelongs to Carl Heyer. The principles of his method are briefly: First\r\ndetermine upon the period of regulation during which the abnormal forest\r\nis to be brought nearer to normal conditions; the length of this period\r\nto be determined with due regard to the financial requirements or\r\nability of the owner and to the conditions of the forest. The actual\r\nstock on hand is then determined and the total increment, based on the\r\naverage increment at felling age of each stand, which will take place\r\nduring this period, is added. Deducting from this total what has been\r\ncalculated as the proper normal stock requisite for a sustained yield\r\nmanagement, the balance is available for felling budgets which may be\r\nutilized in annual or periodic instalments during the period of\r\nregulation. A working plan is provided which takes care of securing an\r\norderly progress of fellings and proper location of age classes, to be\r\nrevised every ten years.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is undoubtedly the most rational method yet devised, it\r\nhas remained largely unused, and is found in somewhat modified\r\napplication only in Austria and Baden.\r\n\r\nAn entirely new principle in the theory of forest organization was\r\nintroduced, when the aim of forest management was formulated to be the\r\nhighest soil rent. According to this requirement the proper harvest time\r\nof any stand, or even of any tree, was to be determined by the so-called\r\nindex per cent., that is, a calculation which determines whether a stand\r\nor a tree is still producing at a proper predetermined rate, or is\r\ndeclining. The advocates of this principle were especially _Pressler_\r\n(professor of mathematics at Tharandt, 1840 to 1843) and _G. Heyer_, son\r\nof Carl Heyer, who based his method on his father’s formula, merely\r\nintroducing values for volumes. _Judeich_, director of the Tharandt\r\nschool, also developed in the sixties a method, based upon financial\r\ntheory, which is to attain the highest rate per cent. on the capital\r\ninvested in forest production. On the basis of survey and subdivision of\r\nworking blocks composing a felling series, and with a rotation\r\ndetermined by financial calculations with interest accounts, he makes a\r\nperiodic area division for determining the felling budget in general,\r\nand in addition employs the index per cent., as explained, for\r\ndetermining in each allotted stand the more exact time for its harvest.\r\n\r\nWhile these men pleaded for a strict finance calculation, such as is\r\nproperly applied to any business making financial results the main\r\nissue, the defenders of the old regime, which sought the object of\r\nforest management mainly in highest material or value production,\r\nadvanced as their financial program the attainment of the highest forest\r\nrent as opposed to the highest soil rent. They neglected and derided the\r\ncomplicated interest calculations which have to take into consideration\r\nuncertain future developments, and were satisfied with producing a\r\nsatisfactory balance, a surplus of income over expenses, no matter what\r\ninterest rate on the capital involved in soil and forest growth that\r\nmight represent.\r\n\r\nAt the present time these financial propositions are still mainly under\r\nheated discussion.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice, the various state forest administrations, with the\r\nexception of the Saxon one, continue to rely upon the older methods in\r\nregulating the management of their forest properties without reference\r\nto financial theories. This is largely due to momentum of the practical\r\nexistence and application of these methods in earlier times and the\r\ndifficulty and impracticability of a change. Just now, however, several\r\nof the State administrations are preparing to radically revise their\r\nworking plans.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia, the instructions for working plans of 1819 formulated by\r\nHartig were improved upon by his successor, Oberlandforstmeister _von\r\nReuss_ (1836), and these instructions formed the basis of the work of\r\nforest regulation until the end of the 19th century. It is a periodic\r\narea allotment with only a summary check by volume. The working plan is\r\nonly to secure a rational location and gradation of age classes; the\r\ncalculations of yields and specific rules of management are lately\r\nconfined to the first period and are revised every six years.\r\n\r\nIn Saxony, Cotta’s area method was systematically developed, and, as the\r\nlarger part of Saxon forests is coniferous, mainly spruce, the proper\r\nlocation of age classes forms a special consideration for the progress\r\nof fellings. The determination of volume and increment was left to\r\nsummary estimates, and the area division became entirely superior. The\r\noriginal idea of Cotta that orderly procedure in the management is of\r\nmore importance than the actual determination and equalization of yield\r\nstill pervades the Saxon practice. Since 1860, an attempt has been made\r\nto calculate the rotation and determine the felling budget on the\r\nprinciple of the soil rent, at least as a corrective of the annual\r\nbudget, and in general to lean towards Judeich’s stand management.\r\n\r\nIn Bavaria, after various changes, a complete allotment method of area\r\nand volume had come into vogue, in 1819; but, at the present writing\r\n(1911) an entirely new and modern re-organization has been begun, in\r\nwhich most modern ideas and especially much freedom of movement, even to\r\ndeviation from the principle of sustained yield, is allowed.\r\n\r\nIn Württemberg, where, in 1818 to 1822, a pure volume allotment had been\r\nintroduced, in 1862 to 1863 the combined allotment method was begun, the\r\nfelling budget being determined in a general way for the next two or\r\nthree periods, and more precisely for the first decade, without\r\nattempting more than approximate equality.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, new instructions were issued, which abandon the allotment\r\nmethod and restrict the yield regulation to designating felling areas\r\nfor the first period.\r\n\r\nIn Baden, where the forest organization began in 1836 upon the basis of\r\nvolume allotment, a change was made in 1849 to an area allotment,\r\nsimplifying to a greater extent than anywhere else the calculation of\r\nthe yield; finally, Heyer’s method was adopted entirely in 1869.\r\n\r\nIt appears then that the schematic allotment methods found the most\r\ngeneral application in the earlier time of the period, being favored\r\nprobably on account of their simplicity in application. The improvement\r\nin their present application over the original methods as designed by\r\nHartig and Cotta, is that now they require no volume calculation for any\r\nlong future, but are satisfied with making a sufficiently accurate\r\ncalculation and provision for the proper felling budget for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Forest Administration._\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the 18th century the recognition of the importance\r\nof forestry led to a severance of the forest and hunting interests, and\r\nit became the practice to place the direction of the former into the\r\nhands of some more or less competent man--a state forester--usually\r\nunder the fiscal branch or treasury department of the general\r\nadministration. Fully organized forest administrations, in the modern\r\nsense, however, could hardly be said to have existed before the end of\r\nthe Napoleonic wars (1815) which had undoubtedly retarded the peaceful\r\ndevelopment of this as well as of other reforms.\r\n\r\nThe present organization of the large Prussian forest department in its\r\npresent form dates from 1820, when Hartig instituted the division into\r\nprovincial administrations, and differentiated them into directive,\r\ninspection and executive services. The direction of the provincial\r\nmanagement was placed in the hands of an Oberforstmeister, with the\r\nassistance of a number of Forstmeister, who acted mainly as inspectors,\r\neach having his inspection district consisting of a number of ranges.\r\nThe ranges (100,000 to 125,000 acres) were placed in charge of\r\nOberförster or Revierförster, who with the assistance of several\r\nunderforesters (Förster) conducted the practical work. At first only\r\nindifferently educated, these latter were allowed little latitude, but\r\nwith improvement in their education they became by degrees more and more\r\nindependent agents.\r\n\r\nThis tri-partite system of directing, inspecting and executive officers,\r\nafter various changes in titles and functions, finally became\r\npractically established in all the larger German states; in some rather\r\nlately, as for instance, in Bavaria, not until 1885, and in Württemberg\r\nin 1887.\r\n\r\nWith this more stable organization, the character and the status of the\r\npersonnel changed greatly: the prior right of the nobility to the higher\r\npositions, which had lasted in some States until 1848, and the practice\r\nof making connection with military service a basis for appointment were\r\nabolished, and, instead of Cameralists, educated foresters came\r\neverywhere to the head of affairs. The lower service, which had been\r\nrecruited from hunters and lackeys, and which was noted for its low\r\nsocial, moral and pecuniary status, was improved in all directions. The\r\nchange from incidentals in the way of fees, and natural instead of money\r\nemolument for the lower grade foresters, (which had been the rule, and\r\nstill play a role even to date), to definite salaries, and the salutary\r\nchange of methods in transacting business, which Hartig introduced,\r\nbecame general. With the development and improvement of forestry\r\nschools, the requirement of a higher technical education for positions\r\nin State service could be enforced. Yet only within the last twenty-five\r\nor thirty years, has the ranking position of forest officers been made\r\nadequate and equalized with that of other public officials of equal\r\nresponsibility, and still later have their salaries been made adequate\r\nto modern requirement.\r\n\r\nThe central administration now lies in the hands of technical men\r\n(_Oberlandforstmeister_) with a council of technical deputies\r\n(_Landforstmeister_) all of whom have passed through all the stages of\r\nemployment from that of district managers up. This central office or\r\n“division of forestry” is either attached to the department of\r\nagriculture, or to that of finance, and has entire charge of the\r\nquestions of personnel, direction of forest schools, of the forest\r\npolicy of the administration, and the approval of all working plans,\r\nacting in all things pertaining to the forest service as a court of last\r\nresort. The working plans are made and revised by special commissioners\r\nin each case, or, as in Saxony, under the direction of a special\r\nbureau, with the assistance of the district manager. Upon the basis of\r\nthe general working plan prepared by these commissions, an annual plan\r\nis elaborated by the district managers with consultation and approval of\r\nthe provincial and central administration. These plans contain a\r\ndetailed statement of all the work to be done through the year, the cost\r\nof each item, and the receipts expected from each source. This annual\r\nworking plan requires approval by the provincial administration, which\r\nis constituted as a deliberative council, consisting of a number of\r\nForstmeister with an Oberforstmeister as presiding officer. The titles\r\nof these officers, to be sure, and the details of procedure vary\r\nsomewhat in different states, but the system as a whole is more or less\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nThe district manager or Oberförster, now often called _Forstmeister_,\r\nhas grown in importance and freedom of position, although his district\r\nhas grown smaller (mostly not over 25,000 acres), and, being one of the\r\nbest educated men in the country district, he usually holds the highest\r\nsocial position, although his emoluments are still moderate. He holds\r\nmany offices of an honorary character, as for instance that of justice\r\nof the peace, and the position of states’ attorney or public prosecutor\r\nin all cases of infraction of the forest laws. These forest laws are\r\nstill largely local, _i.e._, State laws, although the criminal code of\r\nthe empire has somewhat unified practice.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, wood on the stump is still not considered property in\r\nthe same sense as other things, so far as theft is concerned; the\r\nstealing of growing timber is not even called theft, the word used in\r\nthe laws being _Frevel_ (tort), and, like other infractions against\r\nforest laws, it is punished by a money fine, more or less in proportion\r\nto the value of the stolen material or the damage suffered. This money\r\nfine may be transmuted into imprisonment or forest labor, but corporal\r\npunishment, which still prevailed in the first decades of the century,\r\nhas been abolished. Wood stealing was very general and rampant during\r\nthe beginning of the century, but improvement in the condition of the\r\ncountry population and in the number and personnel of the forest\r\nofficers since 1850 has now reduced it to a minimum.\r\n\r\nFormerly, and until 1848, the administrators and even the forest owners\r\nacted at the same time as prosecutor, judge and executioner, and only in\r\n1879, was this condition everywhere and entirely changed, and\r\ninfractions against forest laws adjudged by regular courts of law,\r\nholding meetings at stated times for the prosecution of such\r\ninfractions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the court proceedings in forest matters still vary from\r\nthe usual court practice, providing a simpler, cheaper and more ready\r\ndisposal of testimony and witnesses, and quicker retribution, which is\r\nlargely rendered possible through having every forest officer under oath\r\nas a sheriff, and his statement, and perhaps the confiscated tools\r\nemployed in the theft, being accepted as _prima facie_ evidence of the\r\ninfraction.\r\n\r\nThe social position of the underforesters and the forest protective\r\nservice has also been improved until all charges of incompetency and\r\nimmorality, which were not undeserved even until past the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, have become reversed; the forest service being\r\nmorally on as high a plane as all the departments of German\r\nadministrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Forest Policy._\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the century the old conception of\r\n_Forsthoheit_--superior right of the princes to supervise and interfere\r\nwith private property--changed into the more modern conception of the\r\npolice function of the state, and, by 1850, after the revolutionary\r\nperiod, the seignorage of the princes had passed away. The issue of\r\nforest ordinances (the last in 1840) was replaced by the enactment of\r\nforest laws which, since the establishment of representative government,\r\nhas become a function of legislatures.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to restrict the exercise of private property rights had\r\nbeen assailed by the theories of _Laissez faire_ and the teachings of\r\nAdam Smith, and, as a consequence, all the restrictive mandates of the\r\nolder forest ordinances had been weakened and had more of less fallen\r\ninto disuse. Especially the attempts to influence prices and markets had\r\nnearly if not entirely vanished during the first decade. Only for the\r\nstate forest, it was still thought desirable to predetermine wood\r\nprices, or at least keep rates low, because wood was a necessary\r\nmaterial for the industries. This theory prevailed until, perhaps under\r\nthe lead of Hundeshagen (see above), the propriety of securing the\r\nhighest soil rent was recognized as the proper aim, when the practice of\r\nselling wood at auction in order to secure the best prices became the\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nThe regulations regarding export and import between the different\r\nStates, which had been enacted under the mercantilistic teachings of the\r\nlast century (see page 52), and the many tariffs which impeded a free\r\nexchange of commodities, lasted for a long while into the 19th century,\r\nand were not all abolished until 1865, when under the lead of Prussia,\r\nthe North German Federation instituted the _Zollverein_ (Tariff\r\nalliance) which abolished not only all tariffs between the States of the\r\nFederation, but also tariffs on wood products against the outside world.\r\nImport duties were, however, again established in 1879, and the policy\r\nof protecting the established organized forest management against\r\ncompetition by importations from exploiting countries has been again and\r\nagain recognized as proper in the revision of tariff rates and railroad\r\nfreight rates on the government railroads.\r\n\r\nDuring the first decades of the century, the supply question was\r\nuppermost, and although such men as Pfeil (1816) laughed at the idea of\r\na wood famine, there was good reason, prior to the development of\r\nrailroads, of coal fields, of iron and steel manufactures, etc., for\r\ndiscussing with apprehension the area and condition of supply and the\r\nextent of the consumption. Nevertheless, the attitude of the state\r\ntoward private property was much more influenced by the economic\r\ntheories then prevalent, which taught the ideas of private liberty to\r\nwhich the French Revolution had given such forcible expression.\r\n\r\nWith the change of municipal communities from mere associations with\r\ncommon material interest into units or parts of political or state\r\nmachines, also independence in the management of their property was\r\nsecured, and many of the old restrictions which had circumscribed this\r\nright fell away. Curiously enough, during the French domination under\r\nNapoleon, the new masters, forgetting the spirit of the revolutionary\r\nperiod, introduced the prescriptions of the old French ordinance of 1669\r\nwhich restricted the use of communal property to the extent of excluding\r\nthe owners entirely from the management of their property, and placed it\r\nunder government officers. After the French withdrew, this method, of\r\ncourse, collapsed, although it probably had an influence on the final\r\nshaping of forest policies in these respects. Altogether, there was such\r\nvariety of historic development in the different parts of Germany that\r\nit is not to be wondered at that one finds a great variety of policies\r\nstill prevailing not only in different States but in different\r\nlocalities of the same State.\r\n\r\nAt the present time three different principles in the relations of the\r\nstate to the corporation forests may be recognized, namely, entire\r\nfreedom, excepting so far as general police laws apply, which is the\r\ncase with most of the corporation forests in Prussia (law of 1876);\r\nspecial supervision of the technical management under approved officials\r\nwith proper education, which is the case in Saxony, most of Bavaria, the\r\nPrussian provinces of Westphalia, Rhineland and Saxony, and in some of\r\nthe smaller states; or lastly, the absolute administration by the state,\r\nwhich prevails in Baden, parts of Bavaria, provinces Hesse-Nassau, and\r\nHanover. The tendency, however, in modern times appears to be toward a\r\nmore strict interpretation of the obligation of the state to prevent\r\nmismanagement of the communal property.\r\n\r\nPrivate forest property, which during the preceding century had been\r\nlargely under restrictions, first under the application of the hunting\r\nright, and then under the fear of a wood famine, became in the first\r\ndecades of the century under the influences already mentioned, almost\r\nentirely free, all former policies being reversed; indeed Prussia, in\r\n1811, issued an edict insuring absolutely unrestricted rights to forest\r\nowners, permitting partition and conversion of forest properties, and\r\neven denying in such cases the right of interference on the part of\r\npossessors of rights of user.\r\n\r\nThis policy of freedom was also applied, although less radically, in\r\nBavaria, except as to smaller owners. The result was, to a large extent,\r\nthe increase of exploitation and forest devastation, creating wastes and\r\nsetting shifting sand and sanddunes in motion. The reaction, which set\r\nin against this unrestricted use of forest property, resulted in Prussia\r\nnot in renewal of restrictive measures, but in the enactment of\r\npromotive ones. The law of 1875 sought improvement by encouraging small\r\nowners to unite their properties under one management; but the\r\nexpectations which were founded on this ameliorative policy seem so far\r\nnot to have been realized.\r\n\r\nThis promotive policy has especially since 1899 found expression in the\r\ninstitution in many provinces of information bureaus, which give\r\ntechnical advice, make working plans, secure plant material and give\r\nother assistance to woodland owners.\r\n\r\nA new relation, however, of a conservative character arose by the\r\nestablishment of the entail, i.e., a contract made by the head of the\r\nfamily with the government under which the latter assumes the obligation\r\nof forever preventing the heirs from disposing of, diminishing, or\r\nmismanaging their property. As a result of this arrangement, many of the\r\nlarger private forest properties are forced to a conservative\r\nmanagement, not as a direct influence of the law, but as a matter of\r\nagreement. The condition of state supervision of private and communal\r\nforest property at present prevailing is expressed in the following\r\nstatement of divisions by property classes of forest areas of Germany,\r\nwhich shows that at least 63.9% are under conservative management:\r\n\r\n  Total Forest                    34,769,794 acres.\r\n  Crown forest                                 1.8%\r\n  State forest                                31.9%\r\n  Corporation forest                          16.1%\r\n  Institute forest                             1.5%\r\n  Association forest                           2.2%\r\n  Private forest (10.4% entail)               46.5%\r\n\r\nUntil the beginning of the present century, the protective function of\r\nthe forest had played no role in the arguments for state interference,\r\nbut just about the beginning of the century cries were heard from France\r\nthat, owing to the reckless devastation of the Vosges and Jura Alps by\r\ncutting, by fires and over-grazing, brooks had become torrents, and the\r\nvalleys were inundated and covered by the debris and silt of the\r\ntorrents. A new aspect of the results of forest devastation began to be\r\nrecognized, which found excellent expression in a memoir by _Moreau de\r\nJonnès_ (Brussels, 1825), on the question “What changes does denudation\r\neffect on the physical condition of the country.” This being translated\r\ninto German by Wiedenmann, was widely spread, being interestingly\r\nwritten, although not well founded on facts of natural history and\r\nphysical laws. Nevertheless, sufficient experience as regards the effect\r\nof denudation in mountainous countries had also accumulated in southwest\r\nGermany and in the Austrian Alps, and the necessity of protective\r\nlegislation was recognized. This necessity first found practical\r\nexpression in the Bavarian law of 1852, in Prussia in 1875, and in\r\nWürttemberg in 1879. But a really proper basis for formulating a policy\r\nor argument for protective legislation outside of the mountainous\r\ncountry is still absent, although for a number of years attempts have\r\nbeen made to secure such basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _Forestry Science and Literature._[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] The necessarily brief statements which are made under this\r\n  heading presuppose knowledge of the technical details to which they\r\n  refer. In this short history it was possible only to sketch rapidly\r\n  the development of the science in terms familiar to the professional\r\n  man.\r\n\r\nThe habit of writing encyclopædic volumes, which the Cameralists and\r\nlearned hunters had inaugurated in the preceding century, continued into\r\nthe new one, and we find _Hartig_, _Cotta_, _Pfeil_ and _Hundeshagen_\r\neach writing such encyclopædias. _Carl Heyer_ began one in separate\r\nvolumes, but completed only two of them. Even an encyclopædic work in\r\nmonographs by several authors was undertaken as early as 1819 by _J. M.\r\nBechstein_, who with his successors brought out fourteen volumes,\r\ncovering the ground pretty fully. While in the earlier stages the meager\r\namount of knowledge made it possible to compress the whole into small\r\ncompass, the more modern encyclopædias of _Lorey_, _Fürst_ and\r\n_Dombrowski_ arose from the opposite consideration, namely, the need of\r\ngiving a comprehensive survey of the large mass of accumulated\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nSince 1820, monographic writings, however, became more and more the\r\npractice. Among the volumes which treat certain branches of forestry\r\nmonographically, the works of the masters of silviculture, _Cotta_,\r\n_Hartig_ and _Heyer_, based on their experiences in west and middle\r\nGermany, and of _Pfeil_, referring more particularly to North German\r\nconditions, were followed by the South German writers, _Gwinner_ (1834),\r\nand _Stumpf_ (1849). In 1855, _H. Burkhardt_ introduced in his classic\r\n_Säen und Pflanzen_ a new method of treatment, namely, by species, and\r\nafter 1850, when the development of general silviculture had been\r\naccomplished, such treatment by species became frequent. Of more modern\r\nworks on general silviculture elaborating the attempts at reform of old\r\npractices those of _Gayer_ (1880), _Wagener_ (1884), _Borggreve_ (1885),\r\n_Ney_ (1885), all writing in the same decade, are to be especially\r\nmentioned. In this connection should be also noticed _Fürst’s_ valuable\r\ncollective work on nursery practice (_Pflanzenzucht im Walde_, 1882).\r\n\r\nAt present the magazine literature furnishes ample opportunity to\r\ndiscuss the development of methods in all directions. The text books at\r\npresent appearing seem to be justified by or intended mainly for the\r\nneeds of the teacher and rarely for the practitioner. Such a text book\r\nis that by _Weise_. But the latest contributions to silvicultural\r\nliterature by _Wagner_ (1907), and _Mayr_ (1909) are works of a new\r\norder, utilizing broader ecological knowledge.\r\n\r\nOther branches than silviculture were similarly first treated in\r\ncomprehensive volumes and then in monographic writings on special\r\nsubjects of the branch. The literature on _forest utilization_ covering\r\nthe whole field, was enriched especially by _Pfeil_, _Koenig_, _Gayer_,\r\nand _Fürst_. The first investigation into the physical and technical\r\nproperties of wood was conducted by _G. L. Hartig_ himself, followed by\r\n_Theodor Hartig_, and the subject has been most broadly treated by _H.\r\nNoerdlinger_ (1860). In later years, _Schwappach’s_ investigations\r\ndeserve special mention.\r\n\r\nThe question of means of _transportation_ gradually became also a\r\nsubject capable of monographic treatment and a series of books came out\r\non locating and building forest roads. _Braun_ issued such a book in\r\n1855 for the plains country, and _Kaiser_ (1873) for the mountains, also\r\n_Mühlhausen_ (1876), who had been commissioned to locate a perfect road\r\nsystem over the demonstration forest at the forest academy of Muenden.\r\nOnly within the last quarter of the century were railroads introduced\r\ninto the economy of forest management. The first comprehensive book on\r\nthe subject of logging railroads was issued by _Foerster_ (1885), and a\r\nlater one by _Runnebaum_. _Stoetzer_ (1903) furnished in his compact\r\nstyle the latest discussion on the subject of roads and railroads.\r\n\r\nA very comprehensive literature on the value of _forest litter_ was\r\nbrought into existence by the established usage of small farmers of\r\nsupplying their lack of straw for bedding and manure by substituting the\r\nlitter raked from the forest. Hartig and Hundeshagen were active in the\r\ndiscussion of this subject as well as almost every other forester, the\r\ndiscussion being, however, mainly based on opinions. But, after 1860,\r\nthe subject became so important both to the poor farming population and\r\nto the forest, which was being robbed of its natural fertilizer, that a\r\nmore definite basis for regulating its use was established by analysis\r\nand by experiments at the experimental stations.\r\n\r\nWith the inauguration of the various methods of forest organization\r\ndescribed before, there naturally went hand in hand the development of\r\n_methods of measurement_. Better forest surveys developed rapidly, the\r\ntransit generally replacing the compass and plane table. At this period\r\nthe necessity for books teaching the important methods of land survey\r\nwas met by _Baur_ (1858) and by _Krafft_ (1865). This subject does no\r\nlonger occupy a place in forestry literature, the knowledge of it being\r\ntaken for granted.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the subject of _forest mensuration_ which formerly was\r\ngenerally treated in connection with forest organization has developed\r\ninto a branch by itself, and has been very considerably developed in its\r\nmethods and instruments, making a tolerably accurate measurement of\r\nforest growth possible, although many unsolved problems are still under\r\ninvestigation. Still, late into the century it was customary to measure\r\nonly circumferences of trees, by means of a chain or band, although an\r\ninstrument for measuring diameters is mentioned by Cotta, in 1804, and\r\nby Hartig, in 1808. _Schœner_ and _Richter_ are in 1813 mentioned as\r\ninventors of the first “universal forest measure” or caliper. The\r\nimprovement of calipers to their modern efficiency has been carried on\r\nsince 1840 by _Carl_ and _Gustav Heyer_ and by many others until now\r\nself-recording calipers by (_Reuss_, _Wimmenauer_, etc.) have become\r\npractical instruments. For measuring the _heights_ of trees, _Hossfeld_\r\nhad already a satisfactory instrument in 1800; a very large number of\r\nimprovements in great variety followed, with _Faustmann’s_ mirror\r\nhypsometer probably in the lead. As a special development for measuring\r\ndiameters at varying heights _Pressler’s_ instrument should be\r\nmentioned, and a very complicated but extremely accurate one constructed\r\nby _Breymann_.\r\n\r\nVarious formulas for the computation of the contents of felled trees had\r\nalready been developed by _Oettelt_ and others in the eighteenth century\r\nand a formula by _Huber_, using the average area multiplied by length\r\nwas definitely introduced in the Prussian practice in 1817. The names of\r\n_Smalian_, _Hossfeld_, _Pressler_ and others are connected with\r\nimprovements in these directions.\r\n\r\nThe idea of _form factors_ and their use was first developed by _Huber_,\r\nwho made three tree classes according to the length of crowns, measured\r\nthe diameters six feet above ground, and used reduction factors of .75,\r\n.66, .50 for the three classes. But the first formula for determining\r\nform factors is credited to _Hossfeld_ (1812). _Hundeshagen_ and\r\n_Koenig_ also occupied themselves with elaborating form factors.\r\n_Smalian_ (1837) introduced the conception of the _normal_ or true form\r\nfactor relating it to the area at one-twentieth of the height. An\r\nentirely new idea has lately been introduced by _Schiffel_, an Austrian\r\nGerman, under the name of form quotient, placing two measured diameters\r\nin relation.\r\n\r\n_Volume tables_ giving the volumes of trees of varying diameters and\r\nheight were already in use to some extent in the 18th century; _Cotta_\r\ngives such for beech in 1804, and, in 1817, furnished a new set of\r\nso-called normal tables which were, however, based upon the assumption\r\nof a conical form of the tree. _Koenig_ perfected volume tables by\r\nintroducing further classification into five growth classes (1813),\r\npublished volume tables for beech and other species, and, in 1840,\r\npublished volume tables not for single trees but for entire stands per\r\nacre classified by species, height and density; using the so-called\r\nspace number which he had developed in 1835 to denote the density. It is\r\ninteresting to note that these tables, which he called _Allgemeine\r\nWaldschætzungstafeln_, were made for the Imperial Russian Society for\r\nthe Advancement of Forestry.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 and succeeding years, the Bavarian government issued a\r\ncomprehensive series of measurements and a large number of form factors,\r\nwhich were used in constructing volume tables; these were found to be so\r\nwell made and so generally applicable that they were used in all parts\r\nof Germany and, translated into meter measurement by _Behm_ (1872), are\r\nstill generally in use, although new ones based upon further\r\nmeasurements have been furnished by _Lorey_ and _Kuntze_.\r\n\r\nFor arriving at the _volume of stands_, estimating was relied upon long\r\ninto the nineteenth century, although _Hossfeld_, in 1812, introduced\r\nmeasuring, and the use of the formula AHF, in which A was the measured\r\ntotal cross-section area of the stand, H and F the height and form\r\nfactors, the latter being at that time still estimated. He first made\r\nform classes for the same heights, but, in 1823, simplified the method\r\nby assuming an average form factor for the whole stand. Even in 1830,\r\n_Kœnig_ still estimated the form factor, although he introduced the\r\nmeasurement of the cross-section area and determined the height\r\nindirectly as an average of measurements of several height classes, but\r\n_Huber_ (1824) knew how to measure both the average height and form\r\nfactor by means of an arithmetic sample tree. This method found entrance\r\ninto the practice and held sway until about 1860, when the well-known\r\nimprovements by _Draudt_ and _Urich_ supplanted it. These last mentioned\r\nmethods have become generally used in the practice, while other methods,\r\nlike R. Hartig’s and Pressler’s, have remained mainly theoretical.\r\n\r\nThe study of the increment and the making of yield tables which had been\r\ninaugurated toward the end of the last century, by _Oettelt_, _Paulsen_,\r\n_Hartig_, and others, was just at the end of that century placed upon a\r\nnew basis through _Späth_ (1797), who constructed the first growth\r\ncurves by plotting the cubic contents of trees of different ages, and\r\nthrough _Seutter_ (1799) by introducing stem analysis, on which he based\r\nhis yield tables.\r\n\r\nOn the shoulders of these, _Hossfeld_ (1823) built, when he conceived\r\nthe idea of using sample plots for continued observation of the progress\r\nof increment, and he also taught the method of interpolation with\r\nlimited measurements, laying the basis for quite elaborate formulæ. But\r\nthe first _normal_ yield tables, based on the average trees of an index\r\nstand, were published by _Huber_ (1824) and, in the same year, by\r\n_Hundeshagen_. From that time on, yield tables were constructed by many\r\nothers, but only since the Experiment stations undertook to direct their\r\nconstruction is the hope justified of securing this most invaluable tool\r\nof forest management in reliable and sufficiently detailed form. Even\r\nthe newest tables are, however, still deficient, especially in the\r\ndirection of detailed information regarding the division into\r\nassortments. The yield tables of _Baur_, _Kuntze_, _Weise_, _Lorey_, and\r\nothers are now superseded by those of _Schwappach_ for pine and spruce,\r\nand of _Schuberg_ for fir.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the many yield tables which gradually accumulated, the\r\nlaws of growth in general became more and more cleared up and finally\r\npermitted their formulation as undertaken by _R. Weber_\r\n(_Forsteinrichtung_, 1891).\r\n\r\nThe idea of using the percentic relations for stating the increment, and\r\nof estimating the future growth upon the basis of past performance for\r\nsingle trees was known even to _Hartig_ (1795) and _Cotta_ (1804) who\r\npublished increment per cent. tables. The methods of making the\r\nmeasurements of increment on standing trees were especially elaborated\r\nby _Koenig_, _Karl_, _Edward_ and _Gustav Heyer_, _Schneider_ (his\r\nformula, 1853), _Jaeger_, _Borggreve_, and especially by _Pressler_\r\n(1860) who opened new points of view and increased the means of studying\r\nincrement by causing the construction of the well-known increment borer,\r\nand in other ways.\r\n\r\nThe most modern text-book which treats fully of all modern methods of\r\nforest mensuration giving also their history is that of _Udo Müller_\r\n(_Lehrbuch der Holzmesskunde_, 1899), superseding such other good ones,\r\nas those of _Baur_ (1860-1882), _Kuntze_ (1873), _Schwappach_ (short\r\nhandbook, last edition 1903).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe many sales of forest property which took place at the beginning of\r\nthis period naturally stimulated the elaboration of methods of _forest\r\nvaluation_. Even the soil rent theory finds its basis at the very\r\nbeginning (1799) in a published letter by two otherwise unknown\r\nforesters (_Bein_ and _Eyber_), who proposed to determine the value of a\r\nforest by discounting the value of the net yield with a limited compound\r\ninterest calculation to the 120th year. This idea was elaborated, in\r\n1805, by _Nœrdlinger_ and _Hossfeld_ into the modern conception of\r\nexpectancy values, and the now familiar discount calculations were\r\ninaugurated by them. _Cotta_ and _Hartig_ participated also in the\r\nelaboration of methods of forest valuation; Cotta writing his manual in\r\n1804, recognizes the propriety of compound interest calculations, while\r\nHartig, 1812, still uses only simple interest, and exhibits in his book\r\nas well as in his instructions for practice in the Prussian state\r\nforests rather mixed notions on the subject.\r\n\r\nAltogether, even in the earlier part of the period, there arose\r\nconsiderable difference of opinion and warm discussions, in which all\r\nthe prominent foresters took part, as to the use of interest rates and\r\nmethods of calculation. But this warfare broke into a red hot flame when\r\n_Faustmann_ (1849) with much mathematical apparatus developed his\r\nformula for the soil expectancy value, and when _Pressler_ and _G.\r\nHeyer_ transferred the discussion into statical fields, making the\r\nquestion of the financial rotation the issue. Then the advocates of the\r\nsoil rent and of the forest rent theories ranged themselves in opposite\r\ncamps. This war of opinions, although abated in fervor, still continues,\r\nand the issue is by no means settled.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of what should be considered the proper felling age or\r\nrotation naturally occupied the minds of foresters from early times; a\r\nmaximum volume production being originally the main aim. As early as\r\n1799, _Seutter_ had recognized the fact that the culmination of volume\r\nproduction had been obtained when the average accretion had culminated.\r\n_Hartig_, in 1808, made the distinction of a physical, an economic and a\r\nmercantilistic, i.e., financial felling age, and _Pfeil_, considerably\r\nahead of his time, is the first to call (1820) for a rotation based on\r\nmaximum soil rent. As, however, he had so often done, he changed his\r\nmind, and while he first advocated even for the state a management for\r\nthe highest interest on the soil capital involved, he later rejected\r\nsuch money management. About the same time _Hundeshagen_ clearly pointed\r\nout the propriety and proper method of basing the rotation on profit\r\ncalculations, but it was reserved for a man not a forester to stir up\r\nthe modern strife for the proper financial basis, namely _Pressler_, a\r\nprofessor of mathematics at Tharandt, who became a sharp critic of\r\nexisting forest management, and developed to the extreme the net yield\r\ntheories.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the danger of a shortening of the existing rotations,\r\ndue to the apparent truth that long rotations were unprofitable, called\r\nfor a division into the two camps alluded to; _G. Heyer_, _Judeich_ and\r\n_Lehr_, elaborated especially the mathematical methods of the soil rent\r\ntheory, _Krafft_ and _Wagener_ came to the assistance of Pressler, while\r\n_Burkhardt_, _Bose_, _Baur_, _Borggreve_, _Dankelmann_, _Fischbach_ and\r\nothers, pleaded for a different policy for the state at least, namely,\r\nthe forest rent with the established rotations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs in the previous period, the mathematical subjects, namely, forest\r\nmeasurement and forest valuation, were more systematically developed\r\nthan the _natural history_ basis of forestry practice; the slower\r\nprogress of the latter being caused by the greater difficulties of\r\nstudying natural history and of utilizing direct observation.\r\n\r\nIn _botanical_ direction, descriptive forest botany was first developed,\r\nand several good books were published by _Walther_, _Borkhausen_,\r\n_Bechstein_, _Reum_, the latter (1814), of high value, and also by\r\n_Behlen_, _Gwinner_ and _Hartig_.\r\n\r\nIn the direction of plant physiology, _Cotta_, early and creditably,\r\nattempted (1806) to explain the movement and function of sap, but\r\nremained unnoticed. _Mayer’s_ (1805-1808) essay on the influence of the\r\nnatural forces on the growth and nutrition of trees, contains\r\ninteresting physiological explanations for advanced silvicultural\r\npractice. But these sporadic attempts to secure a biological basis were\r\nsoon forgotten. Not until _Theodor Hartig_ (1848) published his Anatomy\r\nand Physiology of Woody Plants was the necessity for exact investigation\r\nof forest biology as a basis for silvicultural practice fully\r\nrecognized. With the development of general biological botany or\r\necology, a new era for silviculture seems to have arrived. Perhaps in\r\nthis connection there should be mentioned as one of the earlier\r\nimportant contributions of much moment, _G. Heyer’s_ _Verhalten der\r\nBäume gegen Licht und Schatten_ (1856) in which the theory of influence\r\nof light and shade on forest development was elaborated.\r\n\r\nAmong those who placed the study of pathology of forest trees on a\r\nscientific basis should be mentioned first _Willkomm_ (1876), followed\r\nby _R. Hartig_.\r\n\r\nIn _zoölogy_, the early writers began with a description of the biology\r\nof game animals. Next, interest in forest insects became natural, and,\r\nin 1818, _Bechstein_ in his Encyclopædia devoted one volume (by\r\n_Scharfenberg_) to the natural history of obnoxious forest insects.\r\nToward the middle of the century, with the planting of large areas with\r\nsingle species, insect pests increased, hence the interest in the life\r\nhistories of the pests grew and gave rise to the celebrated work by\r\n_Ratzeburg_, “_Die Waldbverderber und Ihre Feinde_” (1841). A number of\r\nsimilar hand-books on insects and on other zoölogical subjects followed;\r\nthe latest, a most complete work on insects, being still based on\r\nRatzeburg’s work, is that of _Judeich and Nitzsche_, in two volumes\r\n(1895). Of course, the general works on forest protection always\r\nincluded chapters on forest entomology. The first of these text-books on\r\nforest protection was published by _Laurop_ (1811), and others by\r\n_Bechstein_, _Pfeil_, _Kauschinger_ and recently by _Hess_ (1896), and\r\n_Fürst_ (1889).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Knowledge of the soil_ was but poorly developed in the encyclopædic\r\nworks of the earlier part of the period.\r\n\r\nNot till Liebig’s epochmaking investigations was a scientific basis\r\nsecured for the subject. Then became possible the improvements in the\r\ncontents of such works as _Grebe_ (1886), _Senft_ (1888), and of _Gustav\r\nHeyer_, whose volume (_Lehrbuch der Forstlichen Bodenkunde und\r\nKlimatologie_, 1856), well records the state of knowledge at that time.\r\nBut only since then has this field been worked with more scientific\r\nthoroughness by _Ebermayer_, _Schrœder_, _Weber_, _Wollny_, and by\r\n_Ramann_, whose volume on _Bodenkunde_ (1893) may be still considered\r\nthe standard of the present day (newest edition, 1910).\r\n\r\nThe question of the climatic significance of forests is one which first\r\nbecame recognized as capable of solution by scientific means when the\r\nmovement for forest experiment stations began to take shape and the\r\nsystematic collecting of observed data was attempted. Most of the\r\nproblems are still unsolved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the aspects of _political economy_ in reference to forest policy\r\nthe foresters had occupied themselves but little, leaving the shaping of\r\npublic opinion to the Cameralists, whose influence lasted long into the\r\ncentury. These produced a good deal of literature in the early years of\r\nthe century when the question of retaining or selling state forests was\r\nunder discussion, and, under the influence of the teachings of Adam\r\nSmith, their opinion was mostly favorably to sale. Only gradually was\r\nthe propriety of state forests recognized by them, till finally the\r\nleading economists, Rau, Roscher and Wagner, took a decided stand in\r\nfavor of this view.\r\n\r\nThe foresters naturally were for retention of the existing State\r\nproperties, but one-sided mercantilistic views regarding their\r\nadministration persisted with them till modern times.\r\n\r\n_Wedekind_, as early as 1821, advocated the theory which is now becoming\r\na practice, that the state should not only retain, but increase its\r\npresent forest property by purchase of all absolute forest soil for the\r\npurpose of reforestation. The erratic and radical Pfeil alone was found\r\nwith the Cameralists on the opposite side in 1816, but, by 1834, he had\r\nentirely gone over to the side of the advocates of state forest,\r\ndeclaring anyone who opposed them fit for the lunatic asylum.\r\n\r\nDivision of opinions existed also regarding the supervision by the state\r\nof private and communal forests. The political economists were inclined\r\nto reduce, the foresters to increase supervision, excepting again Pfeil\r\nin his earlier writings: he modified his views later by recognizing\r\nsupervision as a necessary evil. Cotta, who was inclined to favor free\r\nuse of forest property sought to meet the objections to such free use by\r\nincreasing the state property.\r\n\r\nThe main incentive urged by the earlier advocates of state supervision\r\nwas the fear of a timber famine. This argument vanished, however, with\r\nthe development of railroads, and was then supplanted by the argument of\r\nthe protective functions of the forest, a classification into supply\r\nforests and protective forests suggesting differences of treatment.\r\nNevertheless, the belief that absolute freedom of property rights in the\r\nforest is not in harmony with good political economy--a belief correct\r\nbecause of the long time element involved--still largely prevails. The\r\ndifficulty, however, of supervising private ownership, and the\r\nadvantages of state ownership find definite expression in the policy\r\nwhich Prussia especially is now following, in acquiring gradually the\r\nmismanaged private woodlands and impoverished farm areas for\r\nreforestation, making annual appropriations to this end. Many other\r\nstates also are beginning to see the propriety of this movement.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the systematic study of the economics of forestry has been\r\nrather neglected by foresters, although the subject was discussed by\r\nearly writers, _Meyer_, _Laurop_, _Pfeil_, and in modern times by _R.\r\nWeber_, _Lehr_ and _Schwappach_ (“Forstpolitik,” 1894). The latest\r\ncomprehensive volume on this subject comes from _Endres_ (1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _Means of Advancing Forestry Science._\r\n\r\nDuring the century, the means of increasing knowledge in forestry\r\nmatters have grown in all directions; schools, associations, journals\r\nand prolific literature attesting the complete establishment of the\r\nprofession and practice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe master schools which began to take shape at the end of the last\r\ncentury, and a number of which were found in the beginning of the\r\ncentury as private institutions, were usually either of short duration\r\nor were changed into state institutions: they became either “middle\r\nschools” for the lower service, or else academies. For the higher\r\neducation, the chairs of forestry at the universities continued to do\r\nservice, as at Heidelberg, Giessen, Leipzig, Berlin, etc., but, as these\r\nwere mostly occupied by Cameralists (although Hartig in 1811 filled a\r\nchair at Berlin), and were intended for the benefit of such rather than\r\nof professional foresters, the education of the latter was somewhat\r\nneglected. Most of the existing institutions had their beginnings in\r\nprivate schools. Both these and the state schools passed through many\r\nchanges. The first high class forest academy was established at Berlin\r\ndirectly by the State, in 1821, in connection with the university. Here,\r\nPfeil was the only professor of forestry subjects, the other subjects\r\nbeing taught by other university professors. The fact that in the\r\nabsence of railroads a demonstration forest was not easily accessible,\r\nand perhaps the friction between Pfeil and Hartig brought about a\r\ntransfer to Neustadt-Eberswalde, in 1830, with two professors till\r\n1851, when a third professor was added (now 16 with 8 assistants!). At\r\nthe same time the lectures at Berlin were continued by Hartig, until\r\n1837.\r\n\r\nIn Saxony, Cotta’s private school became a state institution in 1816,\r\nthe forest academy of Tharandt, with six teachers (now 13), and later,\r\nin 1830, an agricultural school was added to it.\r\n\r\nIn Bavaria, a private school was begun in 1807 at Aschaffenburg. It was\r\nmade a state institution, divided into a higher and lower school, in\r\n1819, but was closed in 1832 on account of interior troubles and\r\ninefficiency. It was re-opened and re-organized in 1844 with four\r\nteachers, and was intended to prepare for the lower grades of the\r\nservice. Meanwhile the lectures at the University of Munich,\r\nsupplementing this lower school, were to serve for the education of the\r\nhigher grades. A reorganization took place in 1878, when a special\r\nfaculty for forestry was established at Munich, with Gustav Heyer as\r\nhead professor. This was done after much discussion, which is still\r\ngoing on throughout the empire, as to the question whether education in\r\nforestry was best obtained at a university or at a special academy. The\r\npresent tendency is toward the former solution of the question since\r\nrailroad development has removed the main objection, namely, the\r\ndifficulty of reaching a demonstration forest. Nevertheless, Prussia\r\nretains its two forest academies Eberswalde and Münden (since 1868) for\r\nthe education of its forest officials, the other state academies being\r\nat Tharandt and Eisenach, while chairs of forestry are found at the\r\nuniversities of Tübingen (since 1817), Giessen (since 1831), and\r\nMunich, and for Baden at the polytechnicum in Karlsruhe (1832). For the\r\nlower grades of forest officials there are also schools established by\r\nthe various governments (3 in Prussia, 5 in Bavaria).\r\n\r\nIn 1910, the school at Aschaffenburg was discontinued and the entire\r\neducation of foresters for Bavaria left to the University.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough as early as 1820, Hundeshagen had insisted upon the necessity\r\nof exact investigation to form a basis for improved forest management\r\nand especially for forest statics, and, although, in 1848, Carl Heyer\r\nelaborated the first instruction for such investigations which he\r\nexpected to carry on with the aid of practitioners, the apathy of the\r\nlatter and the troublesome times prior to 1850 retarded this powerful\r\nmeans of advancing forestry. During the decade from 1860 to 1870,\r\nhowever, the movement for the formation of experiment stations took\r\nshape, the first set being instituted in Saxony, 1862, by establishing\r\nnine stations for the purpose of securing forest meteorological data;\r\nthe next in Prussia, in 1865, to solve the problems of the removal of\r\nlitter; and in Bavaria (1866), also for the study of forest meteorology\r\n(Ebermayer), and of the problem of thinnings. But not until Baur, 1868,\r\nhad pointed out more elaborately the necessity of systematic\r\ninvestigations, and a plan for such had been elaborated by a committee\r\ninstituted by the German Foresters Association was a system of\r\nexperimentation as organized in modern times secured (1872). The various\r\nstates established independently such experiment stations, but at the\r\nsame time a voluntary association of these stations was formed for the\r\npurpose of co-ordinating and planning the work to be done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nForestry associations instituted merely for the purpose of propaganda,\r\nwere apparently not organized. The first association of professional\r\nforesters appears to have been formed as the result of Bechstein’s\r\nconception, who proposed in connection with his school (1795 at Gotha,\r\n1800 at Dreissigacker) the formation of an academy of noted foresters.\r\nAs a result, the _Societät der Forst- und Jagdkunde_ was formed, in\r\nwhich all the noted foresters joined with much enthusiasm, and, in 1801,\r\na membership of 81 regular and 61 honorary members was attained. At the\r\nsame time the official organ _Diana_ was founded (1797), in which the\r\nessays of the members were to be printed; after having passed four\r\ncensors. Two sessions were to be held annually. This much too elaborate\r\nplan for the then rather undeveloped education and deficient means of\r\ntransportation defeated to some extent the great object. By 1812, it was\r\nthought necessary to divide the academy at least into a northern and\r\nsouthern section, and for the latter an additional journal, edited by\r\nLaurop, was instituted. The interest, however, decreased continually,\r\nand by 1843, at Bechstein’s death, the academy was abandoned.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there had sprung up a number of local associations in\r\nthe modern sense. The first, in 1820, composed of the foresters and\r\nagriculturists of Nassau; the next, in 1839, of the foresters of Baden,\r\nand, by 1860, nine such local societies of foresters were in existence,\r\nand they have since increased rapidly until now some thirty may be\r\ncounted. The desire to bring these local associations into relation to\r\neach other led to the first Forestry Congress in 1837 (Congress der Land\r\nund Forstwirthe), meeting at Dresden. At that time, and in the\r\ncongresses following, the agriculturists played a leading part, so that,\r\nin 1839, the South German foresters separated, and peripatetic\r\ncongresses were held every one or two years. In 1869, a general\r\norganization was determined upon, and, in 1872, the first general German\r\nCongress of Foresters met, holding yearly meetings thereafter. A rival\r\nassociation having been organized in 1897, two years later an\r\namalgamation of the two was effected in the _Deutscher Forstverein_ (now\r\nover 2000 members). The most striking feature of this forceful means of\r\nadvancing forestry is the institution of the _Forstwirtschaftsrat_\r\n(1890), a permanent committee of about 50 members, which is to look\r\nafter the political and economic interests of forestry, forming a\r\nsemi-official national council.\r\n\r\nThere also exists an international association of forest experiment\r\nstations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the _magazine_ literature, the Cameralists dominated until the\r\neighteenth century. The first journal edited by a forester was\r\n_Reitter’s_ “_Journal für Forst- und Jagdwesen_” which ran from 1790 to\r\n1797. During the first part of the century many others were started,\r\nespecially after 1820, usually failing soon for lack of support. Hartig\r\nhimself participated in this literature with five volumes (until 1807)\r\nof the _Journal des Forst-, Jagd- und Fischereiwesens_ and later (1816\r\nto 1820) with the semi-official journal _Forst- und Jagdarchiv_. Pfeil’s\r\n_Kritische Blätter_ were continued by him from 1823 to 1859, when\r\nNördlinger had the editorship till 1870. An irregular publication of\r\nmuch note was Burkhardt’s “_Aus dem Walde_” (1865-1881).\r\n\r\nSome of the journals founded in earlier times have continued, with\r\nchanges in title and editorships, to the present day. Of these, it is\r\nproper to mention as the oldest, “_Allgemeine Forst- und Jagdzeitung_”,\r\nfounded by v. Behlen, 1825, later conducted by G. Heyer;\r\n“_Forstwissenschaftliches Centralblatt_” (1828); “_Zeitschrift für\r\nForst- und Jagdwesen_” founded in 1869 by Dankelmann; “_Forstliche\r\nBlätter_” founded 1861 by Grunert, continued by Borggreve until 1890.\r\nThe _Tharandter Forstliche Jahrbücher_ were begun in 1842,\r\nand the _Mündener Forstliche Hefte_ in 1892. In 1893, the\r\n_Forstlich-naturwissenschaftliche Zeitschrift_ was established to\r\ndiscuss mainly the biological basis of forestry (changed in 1903 to\r\n_Naturwissenschaftliche Zeitschrift für Land- und Forstwesen_).\r\n\r\nFor the lower grades there has been published, since 1872, _Zeitschrift\r\nder deutschen Forstbeamten_. Several lumber trade journals also discuss\r\nforestry matters. A weekly journal, _Silva_ was begun in 1908.\r\n\r\nTo assist in keeping track of the historic and scientific development of\r\nthe art, an annual summary of magazine literature is being published.\r\nThe first effort in this direction was made in 1876 by Bernhardt’s\r\n_Chronik des deutschen Forstwesens_, which was continued for several\r\nyears, but is now supplanted by _Jahresbericht über die Leistungen und\r\nFortschritte der Forstwirthschaft_ (since 1880).\r\n\r\nBesides this more scientific magazine literature, “_Pocket Books_” and\r\n“_Calendars_” have been published from early times, the regular annual\r\nappearance of the latter, giving detailed statistics, personalia, tables\r\nuseful in the practice, etc., dates from 1851.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the accomplishment of the unity of the empire in 1871, with the\r\nestablishment of the Experiment Stations and their association in 1872,\r\nand with the organization of the Society of German Foresters, which\r\ndates from the same year, a new and most active era in the development\r\nof forestry science may be recognized, the tendency of which is to lift\r\nthe art out of the shackles of empiricism, and place it on a more\r\nscientific basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA-HUNGARY.\r\n\r\n  _Zur Forstgeschichte Oesterreichs_, by BINDER VON KREIGELSTEIN, in\r\n  Verhandlungen der K.

First volume contains the general description,\r\n  third volume the details of government forests. A magnificent work\r\n  describing in detail the forests and forest management of Hungary.\r\n  This is briefed by the same author in a chapter in “_The Millennium\r\n  of Hungary and its People_, by JEKELFALUSSY, 1897.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany’s neighbor to the south-east, and until 1866 a member of the\r\nGerman Empire or Federation, largely settled by Germans and hence swayed\r\nby German thought, developed forestry methods on much the same lines as\r\nthe mother country. Yet there are differences to be found, due to\r\ndifference in economic development, and there is for the United States\r\nperhaps more to be learned from Austria in the matter of introducing\r\nforestry methods, especially as lately practiced in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\r\nthan from any other country, for economic conditions are in several\r\nrespects alike.\r\n\r\nThe interest in the forest history of Austria lies especially in the\r\nfact that private forest property in large holdings is predominant, and\r\nthat large areas are still untouched or just opened to exploitation, so\r\nthat Austria is still in the list of export countries, although in some\r\nparts intensive management has been long in existence.\r\n\r\nIn the main, although movements for reform in forest use date back to\r\nthe middle ages, the condition of forestry in Austria was past the\r\nmiddle of the 19th century still most deplorable, and in a stage of\r\ndevelopment which most of the German States had passed long before; but\r\nin the last 50 years such progress has been made that both science and\r\npractice stand nearly if not quite on the same level with those of their\r\nGerman neighbors.\r\n\r\nIf Germany exhibits in its different parts a great variety of\r\ndevelopment, political and economic, Austria, although long under one\r\nfamily of rulers (since 1526), exhibits a still greater variety due to\r\nracial, natural, and historical differences within its own borders. It\r\nis, indeed, an extraordinary and singular country, without an equal of\r\nits kind (except perhaps Turkey) in that it is not a national, but a\r\ndynastic power, composed of unrelated states or lands, with people\r\nspeaking different languages, mixed races widely different in character.\r\nThese were gradually aggregated under one head or ruling family, the\r\nHapsburgs, who as Archdukes of Austria occupied the elective position of\r\nGerman Emperors for several generations, and after the collapse of the\r\nEmpire, in 1806, retained the title and called themselves Emperors of\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nThe Kingdom of Hungary alone (which was joined to the Hapsburg dominions\r\nby election of its people in 1526, and under new relations in 1867),\r\nwith at least 50% Hungarians, is a national unit with a national\r\nlanguage (Magyar), while all other parts have in their composition\r\npreponderatingly Slavish population, although German elements have the\r\nascendancy more or less everywhere.\r\n\r\nNot less than 10 different languages are spoken among the forty odd\r\nmillion people, of whom the Germans comprise about one-quarter, the\r\nHungarians one-third, the balance being Slavs.\r\n\r\nOriginally, this section of the country was occupied by Germans with the\r\nGerman institution of the Mark, but, when the Slavish and Magyar tribes\r\npressed in from the East, it became the meeting ground of the three\r\nraces, and during the first 1,000 years after Christ the “East Mark”\r\nformed the bulwark of the German empire against the eastern invaders,\r\nwho, were, in succession, the Slavs, the Huns, the Turks.\r\n\r\nWith the unexpected election of Rudolph of Hapsburg, a little known\r\nprince of small possessions, to the dignity of German Emperor, in 1272,\r\nthe foundation of the Austrian Empire was laid. The Archduchy of Austria\r\nhe secured by conquest in 1282, and around this nucleus all the other\r\nterritories were from time to time, aggregated by the Hapsburgs through\r\nmarriage, conquest, or treaty. At one time their rule extended over\r\nSpain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia.\r\n\r\nThe abdication of Francis II, in the year 1806, prepared the separation\r\nfrom Germany, although Austrian influence persisted in Germany until\r\n1866 when, by the crushing defeat suffered at the hands of Prussia, its\r\nplace and voice was permanently excluded from German councils. By\r\narrangement with Hungary, the new dual empire of Austria-Hungary came\r\ninto existence, and gave a new national life and new policies to the\r\ncoalition which is to amalgamate these south-eastern territories into a\r\nhomogeneous nation.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Berlin in 1878, this territory of 241,942 square miles\r\nwith over 45 million people was further increased by the addition of the\r\nTurkish provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina with 1,250,000 inhabitants\r\nand 23,262 square miles, first merely placed under Austria’s suzerainty\r\nand administration, in 1908 incorporated as an integral part.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is natural that, corresponding to this great diversity of\r\nethnological elements and historical development, we should find a great\r\nvariety of forest conditions and uneven development of forestry. While\r\nin Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia the most intensive management has long\r\nbeen practiced, in the Carpathians of Galicia and in Hungary rough\r\nexploitation is still the rule, and in other parts large untouched\r\nforest areas still await development.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe can distinguish at least seven regions thus differently developed:\r\nthe Northwest with Bohemia, Moravia and the remaining part of Silesia,\r\nsettled the longest, and the longest under forest management; the\r\nNortheast, Galicia with the Carpathian Mountains, still largely either\r\nexploited or untouched; the Danube lands or Austria proper, with the\r\nVienna forest and the forests connected with the saltworks in Upper\r\nAustria and Styria, under some management since the 12th and 16th\r\ncenturies respectively; the Alp territory, including Tyrol and Salzburg,\r\nparts of Styria, Karinthia and Krain, much devastated long ago, and\r\noffering all the problems of the reboisement work of France; the Coast\r\nlands along the Adriatic with Dalmatia, Istria and Trieste, which, from\r\nancient times under Venetian rule, bring with them the inheritance of a\r\nmismanaged limestone country, creating the problems of the “Karst”\r\nreforestation which has baffled the economist and forester until the\r\npresent time; the two new provinces east of this region, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, whose rich forest areas have only lately begun to be\r\ntreated under modern conservative ideas; and finally Hungary with a\r\ngreat variety of conditions in itself.\r\n\r\nThe large forest per cent. (a little over 24,000,000 acres or over 32%\r\nof the land area) is due to the mountainous character of the country,\r\nthe Alps occupying a large area on the west and southwest, the\r\nCarpathians stretching for 600 miles on the northeast, various mountain\r\nranges encircling Bohemia, the Sudetes forming part of the northern\r\nfrontier, and the Wiener Wald and other lower ranges being distributed\r\nover the empire and bounding the fertile valleys of the Danube and its\r\ntributaries. At least 20 per cent. is unproductive.\r\n\r\nThe climate in the northern portion of Austria is similar to that of\r\nsouthern Germany; in the southern portions to that of Italy, while\r\nHungary partakes of the characteristics of a continental plains climate\r\nwith low rainfall and extreme temperature ranges.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the tree species found in Germany there are of economic\r\nvalue four species of pine (_Pinus austriaca_, _cembra_, _pinea_,\r\n_halepensis_), two oaks (_Quercus ilex_ and _suber_), and the chestnut\r\n(_Castanea vesca_). Conifer forest is prevailing in Austria (with 82%),\r\ndeciduous forest in Hungary, mostly beech and oak (with 75%); 27% being\r\noak in pure stands.\r\n\r\nThe following pages refer to Austria proper, Hungarian conditions being\r\ntreated separately further on.\r\n\r\nThe value of the total raw product exported from the Austrian forests\r\n(some 180 million cubic feet) may be estimated at over 50 million\r\ndollars annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Property Conditions._\r\n\r\nOn the whole, property conditions developed not unsimilarly to those of\r\nGermany. There were freemen and serfs to start with, developing into\r\nbarons, peasants, burghers; there were ban forests, royal domain,\r\nforests of the mark, and private properties; rights of user or\r\nservitudes and all the methods and conditions that were developed in\r\nother parts of Europe are also found here, only perhaps differing in\r\ntime and rate of progress in their development.\r\n\r\nAs a result of gradual changes, the present distribution of property\r\nresulted, in which the State ownership is comparatively small, namely,\r\nin Austria proper not more than 7.3% (with 2.8 million acres of which\r\nnearly one-third is unproductive land), while private ownership\r\nrepresents over 58.6%. Of this, 34% is in large landed estates, among\r\nwhich those of the princes of Liechtenstein and of Schwarzenberg with\r\nround 350,000 acres and 290,000 acres respectively are the largest; and\r\n25 others with from 50,000 to 230,000 acres may be named. By the middle\r\nof the 19th century, at least 75% of the forest area was in large\r\ncompact properties, a guarantee for the possibility of forest\r\nmanagement; the industrial development of the last decade has, however,\r\nled to considerable exploitation. In upper and lower Austria and in the\r\nAlpine regions small private ownership prevails. The communal forest\r\ncomprises 13%, entailed forest 8%, and the rest belongs to church and\r\nother institutions. These so-called _Fondsforste_ are in part under\r\ngovernment administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _First Attempts at Forest Control._\r\n\r\nThe oldest record of attempts at an orderly management in any part of\r\nthe empire seems to date back to the 12th century, when the city forest\r\nof Vienna had been placed under management. During the 16th and 17th\r\ncentury this property appears to have been managed upon the basis of\r\ncareful surveys and estimates. We also find a definite forest\r\norganization in the forests attached to the ducal salt mines in Styria\r\nby 1524, and the dams, canals and water works for floating timber\r\ndeveloped by 1592 through Thomas Seeauer were the wonder of the times.\r\n\r\nIn 1524 also, Archbishop _Mathæus Lang of Wellenburg_ issued a forest\r\nordinance which was full of wise prescriptions, probably little heeded.\r\nA forest ordinance of 1599 refers to burning of tops and care of young\r\ngrowth in fellings.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, as in Germany proper, forest ordinances were issued\r\nfrom time to time, by the dukes under the theory of the _Forsthoheit_,\r\napplying to limited territories and attempting to regulate forest use.\r\nNo uniformity existed.\r\n\r\nThe iron industry in the more northern provinces had led early to a more\r\nconservative use of forest properties for fuel, and since the mines were\r\nregal property the dukes had a special interest in their conservation.\r\n\r\nIn the Alp territory, especially in Styria, the regal right to the mines\r\ncombined with the _Forsthoheit_ led early to the reservation by the\r\ndukes of whatever forest was not fenced or owned by special grant for\r\nthe use of the mines. In addition, a superior right was asserted by them\r\nin some of the private forests to all the forest produce beyond the\r\npersonal requirements of the owners, for use of the mines at a small\r\ntax; and what other private property existed was burdened by innumerable\r\nrights of user. The exercise of these rights, and the warfare against\r\nirksome restrictions led to widespread illegal exploitation and\r\ndevastation, which as early as the 15th century had proceeded to such an\r\nextent that in Tyrol associations for protection against the torrents\r\nwere already then in existence. Yet in this province, scantily\r\npopulated, with one-third of its area unproductive and one-third\r\nforested, wasteful exploitation continued until recent times.\r\n\r\nIn Krain, which was unusually well wooded, forest reservations were\r\nmade for the use of the mines and furnaces in 1510 and 1515, these\r\nreservations comprising all forest lands within a given radius. The\r\nbalance was mostly divided among small owners, whose unrestricted,\r\nunconservative exploitation continued into the latter half of the 19th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn Styria, nearly one-half wooded and one-third unproductive, a\r\nregulated management was attempted as early as 1572, and by subsequent\r\nforest ordinances of 1695, 1721 and 1767 devastation was to be checked.\r\nBut the resistance of the peasants to the regulations and the\r\ninefficiency of the forest service were such that no substantial\r\nimprovement resulted.\r\n\r\nIn Galicia, unusually extensive rights of user in the crown forests led\r\nto their devastation, and the attempts to regulate the exercise of these\r\nrights by ordinances in 1782 and 1802 were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe forest area along the coast of the Adriatic in Istria and Dalmatia\r\nhad furnished shiptimber even to the ancients. The Venetians becoming\r\nthe owners of the country in the 15th century declared all forests\r\nnational property, reserved for shiptimber, and placed them under\r\nmanagement. They instituted a forest service, regulated pasturing, and\r\nforbade clearing. The oak coppice was to be cut in 8 to 12 year\r\nrotation, with standards to be left for timber, etc. A reorganization of\r\nthis service with division into districts is recorded in the 16th\r\ncentury, when Charles V, in 1520, instituted a “forest college,” i.e.,\r\nadministration. But the district officers, _capitani ai boschi_, being\r\nunderpaid, carried on a nefarious trade on their own account, and by\r\n1775, the whole country was already ruined in spite of attempts at\r\nreform; the “_Karst_” problem remained unsolved; and, when Austria\r\nsecured Dalmatia, in 1897, that country too was found in the same\r\ndeplorable condition, the forest area, there in the hands of the\r\npeasants, having suffered by pasture and indiscriminate cutting.\r\n\r\nIt was the work of Maria Theresa to reform the administration of the\r\nvarious branches of government, and wholesome legislation was also\r\nextended to the forest branch by her forest ordinance of 1754, which\r\nremained in force until 1852. It relieved the private owners, who held\r\nmost of the forest area, from the restrictions hitherto imposed, except\r\nin the frontier forests. These, for strategic reasons, were to be\r\nmanaged according to special working plans prepared by the “patriotic\r\neconomic society.” The management of communal forests also was specially\r\nregulated. Otherwise the ordinance merely recommended in general terms\r\norderly system and the stopping of abuses.\r\n\r\nIn 1771, another forest ordinance proposed to extend the same policy of\r\nprivate unrestricted ownership to the Karst forests, with the idea that\r\nthereby better conditions would most likely be secured; but, since here\r\nthe property was not as in Bohemia in large estates but in small\r\nfarmers’ hands, the result was disastrous, as we shall see later: it\r\nmerely led to increased devastation.\r\n\r\nThe same result followed the increase of private peasant ownership which\r\ncame with the abolishment of serfdom in 1781. In 1782, an ordinance full\r\nof wise prescriptions against wasteful practice intended for the\r\nNorthwest territory sought to check the improvident forest destruction.\r\n\r\nA further wholesome influence on private forest management was exercised\r\nby the tax assessment reform in 1788, when not only a more reasonable\r\nassessment but for the first time a difference was made in taxation of\r\nmanaged as opposed to unmanaged woods and the epoch-making fertile idea\r\nof the normal forest was announced (see p. 115). At the same time the\r\nhunting privileges and other burdens, hampering forest properties were\r\nabolished, and measures for the extinguishment of the rights of user\r\nenacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Development of Forest Policy._\r\n\r\nAs appears from the foregoing sketch of early attempts at forest\r\ncontrol, no uniformity existed in the empire, each province being\r\ntreated differently and the regal rights being applied differently in\r\neach case.\r\n\r\nOriginally the regular circuit or district governments had charge not\r\nonly of the management of State forests but also of the forest police\r\nand the regulation of the management of communal forests. This\r\nsupervision was exercised by the political administration, often without\r\ntechnical advisers, and the different provinces had developed this\r\nservice very variably. While in some provinces no special effort was\r\nmade to look after these interests, the laws remaining mainly dead\r\nletters, in others a better system prevailed. In Styria, for instance,\r\nin 1807, five forest commissioners and 20 district foresters were\r\nemployed; but this organization was of short duration. A loose\r\nadministration of the forest laws was most general. The movement for\r\nreform and to secure a general law for the empire controlling forest use\r\ndates from the year 1814; but, only after the political reaction of\r\n1848, and when the severe floods of 1851 had forcibly called attention\r\nto the unsatisfactory state of things was the necessity of change\r\nrecognized. In 1852, such a general law was enacted, supplanting all the\r\nforest ordinances (with minor exceptions).\r\n\r\nThis law, which in the main is still in force, distinguishes between ban\r\nforests and protective forests. The former are such as require in their\r\nmanagement consideration of their protective value to adjoining private\r\nor State property and personal safety, e.g., to prevent landslides,\r\nsnowslides, avalanches, etc. Protection forests are specially located\r\nforests which for their own continuance as well as for that of\r\nneighboring ones must be managed under special restrictions, e.g., on\r\nsand dunes, shores of waters, steep slopes. The dangers which they are\r\nto prevent being more of an indirect or hidden nature, and only produced\r\nby their mismanagement, the control also is of a more general nature,\r\nthe owner being allowed to manage his property within general\r\nprescriptions, while the ban forests are protective forests of a higher\r\norder and are more strictly and more directly controlled by the\r\nauthorities. The declaration of a ban forest and the prescription for\r\nthe conservative management depend on the findings of a commission\r\nassisted by experts (since 1873).\r\n\r\nThe execution of the law however, being left to the political\r\nadministration of the provinces, jealousies between imperial and\r\nprovincial governments, and fear of resistance and ill will of forest\r\nowners prevented a strict and uniform application of the law. Hence,\r\nfrom time to time, we find ministerial rescripts, and special provincial\r\nlegislation to secure a more energetic enforcement of the law.\r\n\r\nAt first, the reform had reference mainly to the Alp districts, which\r\nhad suffered the most, and, in Tyrol, at least, an organization was\r\ncreated in 1856 which was to manage the State forests, supervise the\r\nmanagement of corporation forests and exercise the forest police. Not\r\nuntil the years 1871-74, however, was a similar service extended to\r\nother portions of the empire, but at the end of that period the entire\r\nempire had been placed under the administration of a “forest protective\r\nservice.” an organization quite distinct from the State forest\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, there were placed under this service nearly two million acres\r\nof protective, and somewhat over 150,000 acres of ban forests, but some\r\n5 to 6 million acres of private or communal forest was under some other\r\nrestrictive policy.\r\n\r\nIn 1888, this service consisted of 14 forest inspectors, 56 forest\r\ncommissioners, 63 forest adjuncts and 80 assistants and forest guards;\r\nin addition 252 special appointees and officers of the State forest\r\nadministration were doing duty in this service, so that altogether\r\nnearly 500 persons were then employed in carrying on the protective\r\nforest policy of the State. In 1910, there were 388 technical attachés\r\nto the provincial authorities employed, and 124 on reboisement work,\r\nwhile the State administration employed only 297 officials of the higher\r\ngrade.\r\n\r\nThe law declares the function of this technical service to be: “to\r\nassist the political government by technical advice and observation in\r\nsupervising forest protection, and in the application of the forest\r\nlaws.”\r\n\r\nIn 1883, the functions of this organization were extended “to instruct\r\nand encourage forest owners in forest culture, and to manage forests\r\ndesignated to be so managed.” The service has been so satisfactory that,\r\nwhile at first much complaint against the enforcement of the regulations\r\nwas heard, owners now ask constantly for its extension.\r\n\r\nThe details of the duties devolving upon this organization are found in\r\na series of laws, applicable to different parts of the empire, which are\r\nbased upon the recognition of protection forests, in which sanctioned\r\nworking plans regulate the management. Forcible reforestation and\r\nemployment of competent foresters in these are obligatory. Now,\r\naltogether about 60% of the Austrian forest area is managed under\r\nworking plans.\r\n\r\nA special reboisement law for the extinction of destructive torrents was\r\nthe result of unusual damage by floods in Tirol and Karinthia, in 1882.\r\nThe basis for this legislation was laid by a translation from the French\r\nof Demontzey’s great work on the reboisement of mountains, by v.\r\nSeckendorff in 1880, and a subsequent report by the same author in 1883.\r\nA law, similar to that of the French was enacted in 1884, for the\r\nregulation of torrential streams. A special fund for the work was\r\ncreated to which the interested parties are required to contribute,\r\nassisted by annual subventions from the State. The contributions of the\r\nState have averaged from 40 to 60%, of the provinces 20 to 50%, the\r\ninterested parties having contributed 30% of the round five million\r\ndollars expended on this work by 1901. In 1910, the contribution to the\r\nmelioration fund by the State had grown to 1.6 million dollars. At the\r\nsame time, for the regulation of the lower rivers an appropriation of\r\n$1,350,000 was made, of which $400,000 was to be used for reforestation\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThis work as well as the reforestation of the Karst (see p. 173) under\r\nthe laws of 1881, 1883, 1885, is carried on by the forest protective\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the forest policy of Austria tends toward harmony with\r\nforest owners and liberation of private property. By reduction of\r\nrailroad freights, which are under government management, by abolition\r\nof export duties, by reasonable tax assessments, etc., the wood export\r\ntrade (now exceeding 30 million dollars) is favored; by the extinction\r\nof rights of user under liberal laws improvement in forest management is\r\nmade possible, the Emperor setting a good example by having renounced,\r\nin 1858, his superior right to forest reservations in the Alp districts.\r\n\r\nThe best exemplification of the spirit of the Austrian forest policy and\r\nof the methods of forest organization and administration is to be found\r\nin the administration of the provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\ndescribed in a volume published in 1905 by the veteran Austrian\r\nforester, Ludwig Dimitz.[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] _Die forstlichen Verhältnisse und Einrichtungen Bosniens und der\r\n  Herzegovina_, LUDWIG DIMITZ, Vienna, 1905, pp. 389. See Forestry\r\n  Quarterly, Vol. III, p. 113.\r\n\r\nHere, the Austrian government has in the short time of 25 years\r\nsucceeded in bringing orderly conditions into the forest management.\r\nUntil 1878, these countries were provinces of Turkey and were placed\r\nunder Austrian suzerainty as a result of the Russo-Turkish War. The\r\nTurks had already attempted a management of the forest lands, which were\r\nin their entirety claimed by the Sultan. Property conditions being\r\nentirely unclear when the Austrians assumed the administration, these\r\nquestions had first to be settled by a survey. This survey resulted in\r\nshowing a forest area of 6.3 million acres, 51% of the land area, of\r\nwhich probably all but about 1.5 million acres is private or communal\r\nproperty; half of the state property is fully stocked and it is\r\nestimated that about 100 million cubic feet is the annual increment.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _State Forest Administration._\r\n\r\nThe State domain in the first half of the 19th century had been reduced\r\nby sales from nearly 10 million acres to 4.5 million acres, and to a\r\nlittle over 3 million acres in 1855. In that year, about one-half of\r\nthis property was handed over to the National Bank to secure the State’s\r\nindebtedness of $30,000,000, and between 1860 and 1870 further sales\r\nreduced the domain to about its present size of 1.8 million acres\r\nproductive forest. In 1872, however, a new policy, and the present\r\norganization were instituted.\r\n\r\nBefore 1849, the forest properties which the Crown or State owned in the\r\nvarious territories were not managed as a unit or in any uniform manner,\r\nbut a number of separate provincial or territorial forest\r\nadministrations existed which were often connected with mining\r\nadministrations and were placed under the Minister of Finance. These,\r\nunder the influence of the educated foresters issuing from the newly\r\nestablished forest school, had, to be sure, been much improved;\r\nnevertheless the Cameralists, as in Germany, were at the head of affairs\r\nand kept the technical development back until after the revolution of\r\n1848, when the accession of Franz Joseph I brought many reforms and\r\nchanges in methods of administration.\r\n\r\nA ministry of Soilculture and Mining was created in that year, and, as a\r\nbranch of it, a forest department, separated from the department of the\r\nChase. To the head of this forest department was called a forester,\r\n_Rudolf Feistmantel_, who elaborated an organization. But, before much\r\nhad been accomplished, the Ministry and its forest department were\r\nabolished (1853) and the forest domain again transferred to the Ministry\r\nof Finance.\r\n\r\nFeistmantel returned in 1856 as Chief of the forest division in that\r\nMinistry, and his organization of the forest property of the State into\r\nforest districts under forest managers and into provincial “forest\r\ndirections” was perfected.\r\n\r\nMatters, however, did not thrive, and, only when public attention and\r\nindignation had been aroused by a policy of selling State property, a\r\nchange of attitude took place in 1872 which led to the present\r\norganization. This places the State forest administration in the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, with an “Oberlandforstmeister” and two\r\nassistants as superior officers, and the rest of the organization is\r\nalso very nearly the same as that in vogue in most German States, each\r\nprovince having a directive service of “Oberforstmeister” with\r\n“Forstmeister” as inspectors, and “Oberförster” with the assistance of\r\n“Forstwarte” as executive officers. In addition a special corps of\r\n“forest engineers” and “superior forest engineers” is provided for the\r\nelaboration of working plans. Lately (1904), a re-organization of the\r\ncentral office provided, besides the department of administration of\r\nState and Funds forests, a department of reboisement and correction of\r\ntorrents, and a department of forest policy charged with the promotion\r\nof forest culture, including the education of foresters and similar\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nMost of the State property is located in the Alps and Carpathian\r\nmountains at an elevation above 2,000 feet, hence financial results do\r\nnot make a good showing.\r\n\r\nSince 1885 it has been the policy to add to the State forest area by\r\npurchase, and by 1898, over 350,000 acres had been added to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Progress of Forest Organization._\r\n\r\nSince 1873, working plans according to unified principles have been\r\nprepared for most of the State property, so that, by 1898, about 82% was\r\nunder regulated management.\r\n\r\nThe progress made in bringing forest areas under organized management\r\nvaried greatly in the different provinces.\r\n\r\nIn northeastern Austria, the first methods of regulated management\r\nconsisted, as in the neighboring territories of Germany, in a simple\r\ndivision into felling areas. The example of the neighbors was also\r\nfollowed later in the northwestern provinces, and in both regions this\r\nmethod was improved upon by allotment according to the propositions of\r\nHartig and Cotta. In addition, since 1810, the method of the Austrian\r\n“Kameraltaxe” with the new and fertile idea of the “normal forest” began\r\nto be employed (see p. 115). The new method now largely employed is an\r\narea allotment checked by the normal forest formula.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEspecially in Bohemia, most of the large baronial properties had, by\r\n1848, been put under a regular system of management according to Saxon\r\nand Prussian precedent. The influence of the former was especially\r\nstrong, and Saxon foresters were largely employed to regulate the\r\nmanagement. Most prominent among these was _Judeich_, who became the\r\nDirector of the Austrian forest school at Weisswasser, (afterwards of\r\nTharandt). By 1890, over 83% of the total forest area of Bohemia capable\r\nof such management had been placed under rational working plans\r\naccording to the most modern conception, and nearly the same proportion\r\nin the neighboring provinces of Moravia and Silesia.\r\n\r\nIn the Alps territory and in the Danube provinces, the regulation of\r\nforest management has not progressed with the same rapidity, partly\r\nowing to the existence of the many hampering rights of user; only here\r\nand there, are properties managed intensively. By 1890, only 23% were\r\nmanaged under rational working plans (40% state and 60% private and\r\ncommunal property), mostly regulated by a combined area and volume\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nIn Styria, in the forests attached to mines, we find already in 1795\r\nquite a remarkable effort in the matter of working plans. Such a plan by\r\nan unknown author deals with volume tables and sample area methods for\r\ndetermining the stock. But the fine plan was stowed away in a cupboard,\r\nand when, in 1830, forest counselor _Wunderbaldinger_ proposed to apply\r\na similar plan he had to wait seven years before permission for a trial\r\nwas granted. He continued, however, the organization of these forests\r\nuntil 1848, using Hundeshagen’s “use per cent.” in the selection forest,\r\nand volume allotment for the woods managed under clearing system.\r\n\r\nIn lower Austria, the Vienna state forest of 70,000 acres had for a long\r\ntime received attention; the first thorough forest survey and yield\r\ncalculation being made in 1718-20, revised in 1782-86, and regulated for\r\nthe shelterwood system in 1820. Within the last 50 years, the method has\r\nbeen changed again and again, until in 1882 the present Austrian method\r\nbased on normal stock principles was applied. Since in this province 50%\r\nof the forest area is small peasant property and communal forest, which\r\nare usually managed without systematic plans, the 33% under working\r\nplans represents more than half of the area capable of such management.\r\n\r\nIn upper Austria, where the salt works are situated, the attempts at\r\nregulated management in connection with these date back to the middle of\r\nthe 16th century, and, after various changes, these forest areas were,\r\nby 1888, placed under working plans of modern style. Over 50% of the\r\nforest area of this province is so regulated. One of the most modern\r\nworking plans based upon Pressler’s soil rent theory and a most\r\nintensive silviculture, is that of the Baron Mayr-Melnhof on his estate\r\nKogl.\r\n\r\nThese details are merely brought forward to illustrate the great\r\nvariation both in the progress of development and in the present\r\nconditions in different parts of the empire, similar differences being\r\nfound in other portions. Suffice it to say that in round numbers about\r\nfifteen hundred thousand acres are managed under more or less intensive\r\nworking plans, and of the balance seven million acres are farmers’\r\nwoodlots on which only silvicultural treatment is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Development of Silviculture._\r\n\r\nThe necessity for conservative forest use and reforestation did not\r\narise as early in Austria as it did in Germany. It was not until the\r\nmiddle of the 19th century that this necessity became apparent in most\r\nof the provinces, when German experiences in silviculture could be\r\nreadily utilized.\r\n\r\nIn Bohemia, the clearing system with artificial reforestation, mostly by\r\nseed, had been introduced at the beginning of the century for the\r\nconifer forests, planting as a rule being resorted to only in fail\r\nplaces. For this planting, wildlings were mostly used. In the\r\nbroad-leaved forest, the selection system, and to some extent the\r\nshelterwood method, were largely followed. The strip system was also\r\nmuch employed, and, as the felling areas were often made too large,\r\nundue increase of undesirable softwoods resulted. During the last 50\r\nyears, silvicultural theory and practice developed very much on the same\r\nlines as in Germany, more intensively in the densely populated and more\r\naccessible regions, and less so in the more distant and thinly settled\r\nmountain districts.\r\n\r\nThe most noted work of reforestation which has occupied Austrian\r\nforesters for the last forty years or more is that of the “Karst,” a\r\nname applied to the waste lands in the mountain and hill country of\r\nIstria, Trieste, Dalmatia, Montenegro and adjacent territory skirting\r\nthe Adriatic Sea. It is a dry limestone country of some 600,000 acres in\r\nextent, stony and rough, and overdrained. Originally well forested with\r\nconifers and hardwoods, it had furnished for ages ship timber and other\r\nwood supplies to the Venetians. Through reckless cutting, burning and\r\npasturing by the small farmers it had become almost entirely denuded,\r\nnatural reforestation being prevented by these practices combined with\r\nthe dryness of the soil, intensified by the deforestation.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, countless laws were passed to stop the progress of\r\ndevastation, but without effect.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at planting was made by the city of Trieste in 1842,\r\nand found some imitators, but with meager result.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, the Austrian government, acting upon representations of the\r\nForestry Association, undertook to encourage and assist private\r\nlandowners in reforesting their Karst lands by remitting taxes on\r\nreforested lands for a period of years, by technical advice, and by\r\nassistance with plant material and money.\r\n\r\nBy this move, so much land was withdrawn from pasture and taxation that\r\nopposition was aroused among the cattle owners, which led to additional\r\nlegislation during the years 1882 to 1887, and finally to the creation\r\nof a commission charged to select the lands which in the interest of the\r\ncountry required reforestation, and empowered to enforce this\r\nimprovement within a given time, the State expropriating the lands of\r\nobjecting owners. At the same time, the Commission brought about the\r\ndivision of pasture lands which were held in communal ownership.\r\n\r\nBy 1909, of the 75,000 acres selected by the Commission as of immediate\r\ninterest 15,000 acres had been planted, mostly with Austrian Pine, at an\r\naverage cost of $8 to $16 per acre, the cost including stone enclosures\r\nfor the plantations, to protect them against cattle and fire, and the\r\nrepairs, which sometimes equalled the original expense. In addition,\r\nsome 50,000 acres of natural growth were brought into productive\r\ncondition merely by protection.\r\n\r\nWhile this activity refers to the northern portion of the coast region,\r\nthe Karst of Dalmatia farther south, being oak country, was mainly\r\nrecuperated by protective measures. Here, in 1873, the pasturing of\r\ngoats was forbidden on areas of over one million acres in extent which\r\nwere found capable of reforestation. In 1876, the partition of communal\r\nholdings was ordered, and portions were designated for forest use, to be\r\nplanted. As a result of these measures, nearly 400,000 acres have been\r\nrecuperated.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Education and Literature._\r\n\r\nThe first forest schools in Austria were established through private\r\neffort, namely one in 1800 in Bohemia by Prince Schwarzenberg, and\r\nanother one in Moravia by Prince Liechtenstein, these two being the\r\nlargest forest owners in Austria. In 1805, another private forest school\r\nwas opened in Bohemia, and at the same time the state institute near\r\nVienna came into existence. This was, in 1813, transferred to\r\nMariabrunn, and, after various changes in the character of the teaching,\r\nwas, in 1867, raised to the dignity of an academy with a three years’\r\ncourse. In 1875, it was transferred to the _Hochschule für Bodenkultur_\r\nat Vienna, an agricultural school, which had been instituted in 1872,\r\nintended to give the higher scientific education in both forestry and\r\nagriculture by a three years’ course. The course was, in 1905, increased\r\nto four years. During the years from 1875 to 1904, over 2,600 students\r\nin forestry alone had attended this excellent school at which over 70\r\nprofessors and instructors are employed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the lower grades of foresters, schools were from time to time opened\r\nin addition to the private ones first mentioned. Such so-called “middle\r\nschools,” were founded at Eulenberg (1852), Weisswasser (1855)\r\ntransferred to Reichstadt, and Lemberg (1874), at which latter the\r\ncourse is two years in the Polish language, and one at Bruck (1900),\r\nwhere the course is three years. At present, there are five middle\r\nschools in operation.\r\n\r\nFor the education of guards, three Forstwart schools were instituted in\r\n1881 and 1883, one each for Tirol, Styria and Galicia, where, in an\r\neleven months’ course, 15 forest guards at each receive instruction. In\r\naddition there are five schools of silviculture where the course is one\r\nyear. Besides these schools, courses in forestry of shorter duration are\r\ngiven at three other institutions.\r\n\r\nBesides these schools, the promotion of forestry science is, as in\r\nGermany, secured by forest experiment stations, which came into\r\nexistence as a result of the earlier deliberations of the German\r\nforesters. The first proposition to establish such a station was\r\nsubmitted in 1868, but its establishment was delayed until 1875, when\r\nsuch a station was instituted at Vienna in connection with the school\r\nthere. The results of the investigations are published from year to year\r\nand have enriched the forestry literature in the German language with\r\nmany important contributions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA very active association life exists in Austria, largely due to the\r\ninfluence of the many large private forest owners. Curiously enough, the\r\nfirst attempt at forming a society of foresters in Bohemia was\r\nsuppressed by the authorities, probably for fear of revolutionary\r\ntendencies, and the effort simply resulted in a literary or reading\r\nassociation to obviate the need of private purchase of books. Not until\r\n1848, the very year of the revolution, did the Bohemian forestry\r\nassociation become a fact, and, under the leadership of the large forest\r\nowners among the nobility, it has become the strongest in Austria,\r\nissuing a bi-monthly association journal from the beginning. Another\r\nstrong local association which dates its beginning as a society for\r\nagriculture back to 1770, is the Moravian-Silesian Forestry\r\nAssociation, which segregated from the mother society in 1850, first as\r\na section, and, having by 1858, attained a membership of 1,000, it\r\nconstituted itself as a separate association in 1886. Besides these,\r\nmany smaller ones exist in Austria. In 1852, a general Austrian forestry\r\nassociation was founded, which, in 1854, began the publication of a\r\nquarterly journal and held sessions in various parts of the empire; but,\r\nby and by, the interest seemed to flag, the attendance at the meetings\r\nbecame smaller and smaller, and finally the association was abandoned\r\nafter a rival, the Austrian Forestry Congress, had been organized in\r\n1874, which later became the _Oesterreichische Reichs-Forstverein_.\r\n\r\nIn Galicia and in Bukowina, the foresters meet as a section of the\r\nSociety for Soil Culture. The same method of forming forestry sections\r\nof the agricultural societies is followed in other parts of the empire,\r\nand at least a dozen or more other local foresters’ associations might\r\nbe mentioned, in which owners of forest properties are as fully\r\nrepresented as professional foresters; and their activity is not only to\r\nbe found in literary labors, but also in practical work. In addition to\r\nthe meetings of these local societies, representative congresses have\r\nmet annually at Vienna since 1876, and have become powerful agents for\r\nimproving legislation and practice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough, as was natural, owing to the difference in conditions the\r\nforestry literature in Austria began much later than that of Germany, a\r\nvery active progress is noticeable since the middle of the last\r\ncentury, and the Austrians are vying successfully with the Germans in\r\nthis direction. The names of _Fioceli_, _Pokorny_, _Böhm_, _Wiesner_,\r\n_Molish_, _Willkomm_, _Hempel_ and _Kerner_ in the direction of forest\r\nbotany, _Wessely_, _von Lorenz-Liburnau_, _Feistmantel_, _Dimitz_,\r\n_Wachtl_ (Entomology), _Dombrowski_ (encyclopedia 1886), _Exner_,\r\n_Janka_ (wood technology), _Guttenberg_ (forest mensuration and\r\nregulation), _von Seckendorff_, _Schiffel_ (forest mensuration),\r\n_Cieslar_, _Reuss_, _Böhmerle_, _Hufnagl_, _Marchet_, and many others\r\nare familiar to all German readers. In addition a very considerable\r\nliterature in the Bohemian language is in existence, some in the Italian\r\nby Austrian authors, and some in the Slavonian.\r\n\r\nThe magazine literature began with publications by various forestry\r\nassociations which became active after 1848. At the present time weekly,\r\nmonthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, yearly and irregular publications to the\r\nnumber of not less than 14 in German, in addition to several in\r\nBohemian, may be counted, among which the monthly _Centralblatt für das\r\nGesammte Forstwesen_, in existence since 1875, and the weekly\r\n_Oesterreichische Forstzeitung_, since 1883, are perhaps the most widely\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNGARY.\r\n\r\nHungary is mainly a fertile plain, traversed by the Danube and Theiss,\r\nan agricultural country, with the forest confined to the hilly portions,\r\nto the mountainous southern provinces of Slavonia and Croatia, and to\r\nthe Carpathians, which bound it on the north and east. Nevertheless,\r\nwhile wood in the plain is scarce, the total forest area, including that\r\nof the two mentioned provinces, is but little less than that of Austria\r\nproper, namely, 23,000,000 acres (28%). Large areas of shifting sands,\r\nand, along the Danube and Theiss rivers, swamps, partly created by\r\ndeforestation, are interspersed with the heavy black prairie and compact\r\nclay-soils.\r\n\r\nAt present, of the 23 million acres of forest the State owns 16%,\r\ncorporations somewhat over 20%, churches, cloisters and other institutes\r\n7.5%, and the balance, over 13 million acres, is owned privately. The\r\nadministration of the State forests is in the Department of Agriculture\r\nbut some are still under the control of the military and railroad\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nAll but the private forests are under State surveillance. Of the private\r\nproperties the majority consists of large holdings and about ten per\r\ncent. are entailed, a hopeful condition for conservative management. Yet\r\nwith an export of 10 to 12 million dollars or more, exploitation would\r\nappear still to be general, and devastated areas abound. It is claimed\r\nthat half the area is under working plans, and that the 1000 million\r\ncubic feet of annual cut do not approach the annual increment. The State\r\nforests yield now in the neighborhood of $600,000 net.\r\n\r\nAlthough naturally influenced by Austrian precedent, forestry matters in\r\nHungary like all matters of administration are largely independent of\r\nAustria, the connection being only in the identity of the ruler.\r\n\r\nThe forests, which had been for the most part the property of the kings\r\nof the Arpad dynasty, had by them been turned over from time to time in\r\ndonations to the churches, cloisters and to colonists, so that when the\r\nHapsburgs succeeded on the throne, in 1526, only a small portion\r\nremained undisposed, and this became State property.\r\n\r\nIn the forests which were necessary for the working of the royal mines\r\nand furnaces, an attempt was early made to secure systematic treatment\r\nunder an ordinance (1565) which gave instructions as to the order of\r\nfellings, the reservation of seed trees, etc. But, otherwise, the\r\ngovernment did not make much effort at regulating forest use until the\r\nmiddle of the 18th century, and then, largely owing to military\r\nconsiderations, urged by General von Engelshofen commanding on the\r\nfrontier against the Turks. The planting of forests for defense was\r\nordered (1743) by Maria Theresa, but this order was probably never\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, however, movements of reform in various directions are\r\nnoticeable. Complete working plans were made for the Kremnitz forest in\r\n1750, and for the Schemnitz forest in 1763. The forest ordinances of\r\n1770 and 1781 and the law of 1791 attempted to regulate the use of\r\ncommunal forests, and ordered the reservation of devastated forest\r\nareas. Other legislation followed in 1807, designed to arrest the\r\nfurther extension of shifting sands.\r\n\r\nAlthough, since 1809, forest inspectors had been employed to look after\r\nthe execution of the forest laws, mismanagement and forest destruction\r\nby promiscuous cutting, pasture and fire remained the rule, and with\r\nthe advent of the railroads, in 1850, increased apace.\r\n\r\nPolitical troubles prevented any attempts at improvement until, in 1867,\r\ncomparative peace and the new régime had arrived, and finally, in 1879,\r\nit became possible to pass a reform law, which is the basis of present\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nA general forest law had been enacted in 1807; this was superseded in\r\n1858 by the adoption of the Austrian law of 1852. But, in 1879, a new\r\nlaw reorganized forest policy and forest service. In that year, the\r\nState interests were placed under the administration of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture with a technical forester at the head\r\n(Oberlandforstmeister), assisted by four section chiefs, one in charge\r\nof the State forest administration, one for the administration of\r\ncorporation forests, one for the elaboration of working plans, and one,\r\nwith the assistance of 20 forest inspectors having supervision of the\r\nexecution of all forest laws. Otherwise the general features of German\r\nadministrative methods prevail, except that for purposes of executing\r\nthe protective forest laws, committees composed of three members chosen\r\nfrom the country officials co-operate with the government service.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1879, modified and intensified in 1898, provides government\r\nsupervision of the management of corporation and of protection of\r\nforests, and prescribes that land unfit for farming, i.e., absolute\r\nforest soil (three-quarters of all forest land), no matter by whom\r\nowned, is to be reforested within six years after having been stripped,\r\nand no new clearings may be made on such soils. Mountain forests, which\r\nare classed as protection forests (around one million acres or 5.4% of\r\nthe forest area so classed), as well as entailed properties, must be\r\nmanaged according to working plans approved by the forest department.\r\nThe declaration of protective forests was to be made by a commission\r\nwithin five years of the enactment of the law. New planting for\r\nprotective purposes could also be ordered, and this under certain\r\nconditions may be done by the interested, i.e., protected parties, which\r\nmay associate themselves for this purpose. Violations of this law are\r\nliable to be punished by a fine for each acre, imposed annually as long\r\nas the offense continues. Two-thirds of the whole forest area is thus\r\nmore or less under State supervision, and working plans for over 12\r\nmillion acres have been, or are to be prepared by the government. An\r\narea allotment method with a normal forest formula as a check has been\r\nmostly employed in this work, which is by no means as yet completed.\r\n\r\nTo promote forest planting several nurseries have been established by\r\nthe government, from which around 10 million plants are annually\r\ndistributed free of charge, and subventions for reforestation of wastes\r\nare also granted annually. It is interesting to note in this connection\r\nthat more than 170,000 acres have been planted to Black Locust, which is\r\nmanaged as coppice for vineyard stakes.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, a special fund for the purchase of forest land by the State was\r\ninstituted by turning all moneys received from eventual sales of forest\r\nland into that fund. Another fund for forest improvement is accumulated\r\nby placing four-fifths of all penalties collected for forest trespasses\r\ninto a separate account for that purpose. These funds have not\r\naccumulated very fast, the forest improvement fund, in 1896, being only\r\nabout $120,000.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Landes in France, there exist in various parts of Hungary\r\nextensive sand wastes and shifting sands, partly caused by\r\ndeforestation. Ever since 1788, legislation has attempted to secure a\r\nrehabilitation of these waste areas, which cover in all some 600 square\r\nmiles. In 1817, a first systematic beginning was made in the Banat, on\r\nthe “Alföld” of the Magyars, under the forest director _Bachofen_,\r\nsimilar to _Brémontier’s_ undertaking in France. By 1842, the total\r\nplantations amounted to about 12,000 acres, and by 1869, some 20,000\r\nacres had been reforested, and parts of the plantations had begun to\r\nyield profits. But even to-day, there are still large areas in a desert\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nA classic volume in German by _Joseph Wessely_, Hungarian forest\r\ndirector, _Der europäische Flugsand und seine Kultur_, describes in\r\ndetail the principles and methods of reclamation of shifting sands.\r\n\r\nMost of the Hungarian forestry literature being written in the Magyar\r\nlanguage, is inaccessible to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nEfforts by private endeavor to promote forestry education date back as\r\nearly as 1796, when Forest Inspector _Vizner_ opened an elementary\r\nforest school and wrote a forestry catechism.\r\n\r\nThis effort was followed, in 1806, by introducing the subject in the\r\nagricultural school at Keszthely, and, in 1808, in the school of mines\r\nin Schemnitz (Selmecz banya), a German forester _Wilkins_ filling the\r\nchair, while a special forest school was established at Hermannstadt in\r\n1817.\r\n\r\nThe forestry courses at Schemnitz were enlarged and the school\r\nre-organized in 1846 and again in 1872; one of the changes being the use\r\nof the Hungarian language in its instruction, which had originally been\r\nin German. In 1904, the course, which was 3 years and only optionally 4\r\n(one year for engineering education), was made 4 years for all, and is\r\nobligatory for all higher grade State officials.\r\n\r\nIn Croatia-Slavonia, which is in many respects separately administered,\r\nan agricultural and forestry school exists at Kreutz (Körös) with a\r\nthree-year course.\r\n\r\nFor the lower service four schools of two-year courses have been\r\nestablished by the government, the instruction being given by\r\npractitioners, and some of the students receiving free tuition.\r\n\r\nA forest experiment station was established in 1898; it issues a\r\nquarterly magazine, _Irdeszeti Kiserletek_, in which its results are\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nA Hungarian forestry association was formed in 1866; it issues a monthly\r\njournal, distributes pamphlets, gives prizes for literary effort, etc.,\r\nand is, with over 2000 members, an active agent in the work of reform. A\r\nseparate forestry association, which also publishes a monthly in the\r\nSlavish language, exists in Croatia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A very good brief statement of present conditions of forestry in\r\n  Switzerland with some historical references may be found in\r\n  _Handwörterbuch der Schweizerischen Volkswirthschaft_, Berlin 1903,\r\n  with two chapters by DR. J. COAZ and Prof. C. BOURGEOIS.\r\n\r\n  F. FANKHAUSER, _Geschichte des bernischen Forstwesens bis in die\r\n  neuere Zeit_, Bern 1893, gives insight into the developments in one\r\n  of the cantons, beginning in 1304.\r\n\r\n  LANDOLT, _Ueber die Geschichte der Waldungen und des Forstwesens_,\r\n  Zürich, 1858.\r\n\r\n  _L’évolution forestière dans le canton de Neuchâtel,\r\n  Histoire-Statistique_ 1896.\r\n\r\n  BURRI, _Die kulturgeschichtliche Entwicklung und wirthschaftliche\r\n  Bedeutung des schweizerischen Waldbestands_, Luzern 1898.\r\n\r\n  MEISTER, _Die Stadtwaldungen von Zürich_, 2d ed, 1903, exhibits on\r\n  225 pages in great detail the history and methods of management of\r\n  this remarkable city forest of only about 3,000 acres.\r\n\r\n  _Report of the British Foreign Office on Swiss Forest Laws_, by\r\n  CONWAY THORNTON, 1888, gives a very satisfactory exposé of the\r\n  earlier legislation.\r\n\r\nThe interest which we have in the development of forestry in this small\r\nterritory, of somewhat less than 16,000 square miles with over three\r\nmillion people, lies in the fact that it is a republic, or rather an\r\naggregation of republics, the oldest in existence, and that, occupying\r\nan Alpine mountain country, it has developed a unique co-operative\r\npolicy of forest protection. Being largely German by origin and\r\nsentiment, German influence on the development of forestry methods,\r\noutside of the administrative measures, has here been as strong as in\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland did not exist as a power in name until the 17th century, and\r\nas a unit not until the reconstruction of 1815, and in its present\r\nsettled condition and constitution not until 1848, although the nucleus\r\nof its political existence dates back at least 600 years, when, in 1291,\r\nthe people of the three forest cantons, Schwyz, Uri and Unterwalden,\r\nformed their first league to resist encroachments on their rights by the\r\nchurch and by the feudal barons.\r\n\r\nThe country became settled, similarly to Germany, by Germans, and\r\nespecially Burgundians, a free people; but when the control of the\r\nObermärker over the free communities began to ripen into feudal\r\nsuperiority, it found resistance in the forest cantons, and these formed\r\na league to fight the duke of Hapsburg, who partly as feudal lord,\r\npartly as Reichsvogt, the emperor’s representative, claimed obnoxious\r\nrights. Through admission of neighboring lands and cities to the league,\r\nthe number of confederates had by the middle of the 14th century grown\r\nto eight, and when, by the battles of Sempach (1386) and Næfels (1388),\r\nthe Austrian Hapsburg supremacy had been permanently destroyed, the\r\nnumber of allies grew, and, by conquest and annexation and otherwise,\r\ntheir territory attained nearly the present size by the middle of the\r\n15th century; the war against feudalism being the cause for this growth.\r\n\r\nThese various small republics, however, always formed a part of and owed\r\nallegiance to the German Empire, although they resisted the arms of the\r\nEmperor as Archduke of Austria--until, with the peace of 1499, this\r\nconnection became entirely nominal. The final separation from the German\r\nempire and acknowledgement of independence was not pronounced until the\r\npeace of Westphalia, in 1648.\r\n\r\nThe league of cantons was only a very loose confederation without any\r\ncentral power, although a diet, to which each canton sent a delegate,\r\nhad deliberative functions. Almost immediately after the alliance was\r\nformed it became fatally divided, especially when religious differences\r\narose, and throughout the 16th and first half of the 17th century,\r\ncontinuous warfare existed between the different allies.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be understood that the peasants in the different\r\ncantons were entirely free from the ancient tyrannies. With the\r\nexception of the three forest cantons, which were truly democratic\r\nrepublics, the majority of the Swiss peasants, free in the eyes of the\r\noutside world, were mere serfs until the beginning of the 18th century,\r\nand secured their freedom only after many revolts.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly 500 years of this loose federation, it was reserved to\r\nNapoleon to proclaim the Helvetian Republic one and indivisible, in\r\n1798, after a short struggle of 74 days. This constitution fell with the\r\nfall of Napoleon, and gave place, in 1815, to a reorganized federation,\r\nin which the former sovereignty of each canton was re-established, the\r\ninviolability of the territory being guaranteed by the European powers.\r\nFinally in 1848, the seventh and last phase of reconstruction brought\r\ninto existence the “Bund,” the Confederation of Switzerland, very much\r\nafter the pattern of the United States, the constitution then adopted\r\nbeing once more revised in 1874.\r\n\r\nThe country is divided into 19 entire and 6 half states or cantons,\r\nwhich are a unit towards foreign powers, but have as much independence\r\namong themselves as each of the United States, each self-governing. A\r\nparliament (_Bundesversammlung_) of two chambers--the _Nationalrath_ of\r\n145 members corresponding to the House of Representatives, the\r\n_Standesrath_ with 44 members, equivalent to the Senate--represent the\r\ninterests of the whole federation. The administration of the cantons\r\nlies in the hands of the “great” and “small” councils, with an executive\r\nministry of three members chosen for two years by the former council.\r\nThe administration of the Bund is in the hands of the _Bundesrath_ of 7\r\nmembers, elected by the parliament, which also elects one of the members\r\nas president for one year. The Referendum, which, if 30,000 voters\r\ndemand it within 3 months, requires reference of any law to the direct\r\nvote of the people is used as a check on legislation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the larger part of the population of 3 million people is\r\nGerman, parts of Switzerland are French, and other parts Italian.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief statement of the political development of the country it\r\nwill appear that the development of forestry must also have varied.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Forest Conditions and Property Rights._\r\n\r\nTopographic and soil conditions necessarily had also their influence on\r\nthis development. In the plains, the plateau, and the hill country, the\r\ndistinction of forest and field as it now exists had been in general\r\nattained in the 15th century, while in the mountain country, forest\r\ndestruction began only in the 18th century and continued till the middle\r\nof the 19th century, stimulated by the development of the metal\r\nindustry and the improvement in means of communication. The clearings\r\nmade here were turned into pasture and, being overpastured, became waste\r\nlands. Thus, owing to topographic and soil conditions, a very uneven\r\ndistribution of forest has resulted and we find a variation in forest\r\narea from 9% (Genf) to over 39% (in the Jura) of the total land area of\r\nthe different cantons, the average being 20.6%, leaving out of\r\nconsideration the area above timber limit (5,000 to 7,500 feet) and the\r\nwaters and rocks below. This is less than in Germany and Austria, more\r\nthan in France; but, if allowance is made for unproductive soil which is\r\nincluded in the German area statements, the percentage of forest area on\r\nproductive soil would about equal that of Germany. In the last 25 years,\r\nthe area has increased by 10 per cent. to 2,140,000 acres. This area is\r\ninsufficient to supply the demand, from 15 to 25% of it being imported.\r\nIn 1907, the imports had risen to nearly 25 million cubic feet, valued\r\nat $9 million.\r\n\r\nProperty rights developed at first similarly to those developed on\r\nGerman soil, except that, as we have seen, feudal conditions were not\r\nallowed to gain foothold to the same extent, and liberty from serfdom\r\nwas secured earlier. In 1798, seigniorial rights had pretty nearly been\r\nextinguished. At present, ownership is still largely communal: nearly\r\n67% are so owned, making this property of highest forest political\r\nimportance; private owners hold only 28.5%, and the cantonal forests\r\nrepresent but 4.6%; the Bund as such owning none. It is also to be noted\r\nthat communal property is constantly increasing by purchases from\r\nprivate holdings.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Development of Forest Policy._\r\n\r\nNo doubt, in some parts the first beginnings of care for forest property\r\nand forest use date back even to Roman times. Charlemagne had his forest\r\nofficials here as elsewhere, and the number of ban forests seems to have\r\nbeen especially great, some 400 “bannbriefe,” documents establishing\r\nthem, having been collected at Bern. The first forest ordinance\r\nregulating the use of a special forest area in Bern dates from 1304. But\r\nthe first working plan seems to have been made for the city forest of\r\nZürich, the so-called _Sihlwald_, in 1680-1697, and to this day this\r\ncorporation property, with its intensive and most profitable management,\r\nis the pride of all Switzerland. The Bernese cantonal forests were first\r\nsurveyed and placed under management from 1725 to 1739, and fully\r\nregulated by 1765.\r\n\r\nAn excellent forest code for Bâle was drawn up in 1755 by Bishop Joseph\r\nWilliam; and in 1760, through the propaganda of the two scientific\r\nsocieties of Zurich and Bern, the teaching of forestry was begun, and\r\nforest organization in the two cantons secured in 1773 and 1786. The\r\ncanton of Soleure (Solothurn) was the first to start a regular system of\r\ninstruction, two citizens from each woodland district being given the\r\nopportunity to qualify themselves as foresters.\r\n\r\nEach canton had, of course, its own laws protecting forest property\r\nagainst theft and fire; in the latter respect especially great care was\r\nexercised and burning of brush could only be done by permit and under a\r\nforce of watchers.\r\n\r\nThe example of Zürich and Bern in organizing the management of their\r\nforest areas was followed more or less by other cantons, but a real\r\nserious movement is not discernible until the beginning of the 19th\r\ncentury, when with the impetus of modern life and trade the value of\r\nforest property increased, and most cantons issued regulative forest\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nForest ordinances had from time to time attempted to prevent the\r\ndecrease of forest area by forbidding clearings, regulating pasture, and\r\nforbidding wood export to other villages or cantons, a local timber\r\nfamine being dreaded. But, only when a severe flood, in 1830, had\r\naccentuated the protective value of forest cover, were the forest\r\nordinances more strenuously enforced, and a general movement for better\r\nmanagement began in the various cantons. This was partly signalized by\r\nsending young men to the forest schools of Germany.\r\n\r\nLargely through the influence of a lively propaganda carried on by such\r\nmen as _Landolt_ and _Coaz_, backed by the Swiss forestry association,\r\n(founded in 1848), and through the increase of torrential floods,\r\nespecially in 1834 and 1868, was it made clear that a central power\r\nwould have to be clothed with authority to regulate the use at least of\r\nthe alpine forest.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, the Bund ordered an investigation of the mountain forests in\r\nall parts; this was made by Landolt. But opposition by the cantons\r\nagainst restrictive measures prevented any legislative result. At the\r\nsame time, an annual vote of $2,000 was made to the forestry\r\nassociation for reforestation and engineering works in the Alps. This\r\ngrant was changed, in 1871, by voting an annual credit of $20,000 to be\r\nexpended by the Bundesrath for similar purposes. The floods of 1868\r\nbrought such distress in certain cantons that contributions from all\r\nother parts were required to assist the flood sufferers; and $200,000 of\r\nthe collections were appropriated for reforestation. Finally, in 1874,\r\nthrough the effort of the forestry association, it was determined to\r\ncreate a central bureau of forest inspection for the whole Bund in the\r\nDepartment of the Interior, and an article was inserted in the\r\nconstitution declaring the superior right of oversight by the Federation\r\nover the water and forest police in the high Alps, at the same time\r\nproposing to aid in the engineering and reboisement work necessary to\r\ncorrect the torrents, and to take measures for the preservation of these\r\nworks and forests.\r\n\r\nThe result was the installation of a federal forest inspector with one\r\nassistant, in 1875, and the enactment of a law, in 1876, which\r\ndetermined the area within which the federal government was to exercise\r\nsupervision. The execution of the law was, however, left to the\r\ncantons--the jealousies of State rights as against federal rights being\r\neven more strongly developed in Switzerland than in the United States.\r\nEach canton proceeded in its own way, or neglected to proceed, and hence\r\nno uniform progress in applying the law was made. Indeed, not a single\r\nprescription of the law was applied within the prescribed time, although\r\nagain and again extended, and even to-day some cantons have not yet\r\ncomplied. Stubborn opposition to the law continues even to date in some\r\ncantons.\r\n\r\nBesides the unwillingness to submit to federal authority, the lack of\r\ntechnically trained foresters--their employment being a requirement of\r\nthe law--and the objection to their employment by the cantons, who\r\nlooked on them as disguised policemen, impeded the progress of the\r\nreform. Until 1884, each canton held its own examinations for forest\r\nofficials, but in that year a standard was enacted for employment within\r\nthe federally supervised territory.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent quarrel was as to what was to be considered forest and\r\nwhat pasture, so that finally as a compromise a classification between\r\nthe two, called pasture woods, was introduced.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the federal surveillance was to extend only to the\r\nHigh Alps above a certain limiting line. This limitation was removed, in\r\n1898, by resolution of the Council, and change of the constitution, by\r\nwhich the federal exercise of water and forest police was extended over\r\nthe whole country, and a bill to carry this into effect was introduced.\r\nFinally, in 1902, a revised law was passed establishing fully the\r\npresent Federal forest policy.\r\n\r\nThis law places the surveillance of all forest police in all forests of\r\nSwitzerland in the Bund, the private forests as well as the public,\r\ni.e., State and communal or corporation forests. But, as there are\r\ndistinctive differences in the manner of this surveillance, a\r\ndifferentiation of ownership conditions and forest conditions was to be\r\nmade by the cantons within two years.\r\n\r\nThe forests are to be divided into protection and non-protection forests\r\n(by the cantons with sanction of the Bund), the former being such as are\r\nlocated at headwaters or furnish protection against snowslides,\r\nlandslides and rockfalls, floods, and climatic damage. Most of this\r\nsegregation had already been made and mapped in consequence of the law\r\nof 1876. In 1904, 71% of the total forest area had been classed as\r\nprotective forest; nearly 80% of the communal, and over 50% of the\r\nprivate forest property.\r\n\r\nAll public forests are to be surveyed and their corners permanently\r\nmarked by the cantons according to instructions by the Bund, the latter\r\nfurnishing the needed triangulation survey, and inspecting and revising\r\nany older surveys free of charge.\r\n\r\nThe surveyed public forests are to be fully regulated according to a\r\nsustained yield management, under working plans made according to\r\ninstructions by the Cantons, to be sanctioned by the Bundesrath. For the\r\nunsurveyed forest areas at least a provisional felling budget is to be\r\ndetermined, as nearly as possible representing the sustained yield. In\r\nprotection forests the working plans must conform to the objects of\r\nthese forests, and clearings in these are as a rule forbidden. The\r\nfellings are to be made under direct supervision of foresters, and,\r\nafter being cut, the wood must be measured. Sale on the stump is\r\nforbidden, otherwise no interference in the management is intended.\r\n\r\nUp to 1902, under the law of 1876, working plans for 540,000 acres had\r\nbeen made. In 1907, 90,000 acres of State forest, and over one million\r\nacres of corporation forests were under working plans.\r\n\r\nFor other than protection forests the law provides a number of\r\nrestrictions, such as the following: Pasture woods may not be decreased\r\nin area except by permission of the cantons. Communal forests are not to\r\nbe subdivided without consent of the cantonal government, except where\r\ntwo or more communities have joint ownership, nor are they to be sold\r\nexcept with such permission. Rights of user in public forests,\r\nespecially in protection forests, may be forcibly extinguished by the\r\ncantonal government, but under appeal to the Bundesrath. Money\r\nequivalents are to be the rule, territorial equivalents to be given only\r\nby special permission. By 1902, over $300,000 had already been spent in\r\nextinguishing 2,842 different rights of user. The establishment of means\r\nof transportation, roads, etc., is encouraged by subventions from the\r\nBund and in other ways.\r\n\r\nPrivate forests as far as they fall under the classification of\r\nprotection forests are subject to the same supervision and rules as the\r\npublic forests as regards their survey, the prohibition of clearings\r\nexcept by permission of the Federal Government, of diminishing pasture\r\nwoods, the extinguishment of rights of user, the prevention of damaging\r\nuse, and assistance in establishing means of transportation. The\r\ncantonal government is obliged to insure the execution of these laws.\r\n\r\nIn addition, while the law encourages co-operative forest management of\r\nsmall holdings as larger units, the Bund paying for the cost of\r\neffecting such co-operation, it empowers the canton or the Bund to\r\nenforce such co-operative management of protection forest areas in\r\nspecially endangered localities as at the headwaters of torrential\r\nstreams. Otherwise, in the non-protective private forests, only the\r\nprohibition of clearing except by permission of the cantonal government,\r\nthe obligation of reforesting felling areas within three years, and of\r\nmaintaining existing pasture woods is ordered. Wherever on private\r\nproperties conversion of forest into farm or pasture is permitted (after\r\nreport of the forest administration of Canton or Bund) an equivalent\r\nreforestation of other parts may be ordered. Wherever by the\r\nreforestation of bare ground protective forest areas can be created,\r\nthis may be ordered, the Federal or the Cantonal government contributing\r\ntowards such work; or else, if the owner prefers, he may insist upon\r\nhaving his ground expropriated by the Canton or other public\r\ncorporation; the federal government assisting in the first case to the\r\nextent of 30 to 50% of the cost, and in establishing new protection\r\nforests to the extent of 50 to 80%.\r\n\r\nBefore 1902, under the law of 1876, some 16,000 acres had been\r\nreforested and put in order at an expense of over one million dollars,\r\nthe federal government contributing just about fifty per cent. In 1910,\r\nthe area of planted protection forest had grown to 25,000 acres.\r\n\r\nBesides the various restrictions with provisions of penalties for\r\ndisobedience (from $1 to $100 for each transgression) and enforced\r\nexecution by cantonal government, there are a number of directions in\r\nwhich the Federal Government makes contributions for the purpose of\r\nencouraging conservative management. For the salaries of the cantonal\r\nhigher forest officials 20 to 35 per cent. are contributed, for the\r\nhigher corporation and co-operative association officials 5 to 25 per\r\ncent., for the lower forest service 5 to 20 per cent. The Federation\r\nparticipates to the extent of one-third in the accident insurance of\r\nforest officers; a minimum salary of the officials and also their proper\r\neducation being made conditions. To secure the latter the Federation\r\npays for teachers and demonstration material under prescribed\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, the federal contributions amounted to $100,000 in all. In 1903,\r\nthe total appropriation was $126,000, namely, $9,000 for the\r\nInspector-General’s office; $26,000 towards salaries of cantonal\r\nforesters; $80,000 towards reboisement; $8,000 towards survey. The\r\ncantonal governments contributed about the same amount outside of the\r\ncost of their forest administrations. It is estimated that the budget\r\nwill have to be increased by $50,000 annually for some time to come. By\r\n1910, the federal government had altogether contributed $2 million in\r\nthe 35 years towards the execution of the law, outside its\r\nadministrative office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe organization which is to carry out this forest policy is still the\r\none which originated with the law of 1876, somewhat modified by the law\r\nof 1892, namely, a forestry division in the Department of the Interior,\r\nwith one Superior Forest Inspector and three assistants.\r\n\r\nThe Cantons have their own administrations, mostly under one forester of\r\nhigher grade (called variously Oberförster, Forstinspektor,\r\nForstmeister, Oberforstmeister). Bern has three co-ordinate\r\nForstinspektor. The Cantons are or are to be districted into forest\r\ncircles (Forstkreise), the subdivision to be approved by the Bundesrath,\r\nand some are further subdivided into ranges (Unterförsterei). These\r\nforest districts, from 7,500 to 45,000 acres each, are to be managed by\r\nproperly educated and paid foresters elected by the people. The\r\neligibility depends upon an examination, the theoretical part of which\r\nis conducted by the forest school, the practical part, after a year’s\r\npractical work, is conducted by a commission of foresters, after\r\ncompletion of which the candidate becomes eligible; the election being\r\nfor three years, and re-election being usual, unless there are good\r\nreasons against it.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, there were employed as administrators or managers 119 State\r\n(Cantonal) foresters and 33 Communal foresters, besides 11 Federal\r\nforest officials. In 1909, the total number had grown to 193, besides\r\n1091 under-foresters, to whose salaries the Bund contributed. The State\r\nforesters are allowed to manage neighbouring communal properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Forestry Practice._\r\n\r\nThe timber forest is the most general form of silvicultural management.\r\nSelection forest with 150 to 200 year rotations is practised in the Alps\r\nand in the smaller private forest areas. Shelterwood system in\r\ncompartments is in use in other parts (with a rotation of 60 to 80 years\r\nin the deciduous, and 80 to 120 years in conifer forest), supplanting\r\nlargely the clearing and planting system which had found favor during\r\nthe middle of last century.\r\n\r\nIn corporation forests, large areas are still under coppice with\r\nstandards, but will probably soon be converted into timber forest, a\r\npolicy favored by cantonal instructions. Pure coppice is only rarely\r\nmet, usually confined to the overflow lands and small private holdings.\r\nIn some of the public forests in the French territory it is practised\r\nwith a “double rotation” (_furetage_) according to French pattern.\r\n\r\nArtificial means to secure complete stands in natural regenerations is\r\nfavored by the cantonal regulations, but thinning operations are still\r\nmostly neglected, except where local market for inferior material makes\r\nthem advisable, which is mostly in the plains country, where the annual\r\nyield from thinnings may represent 30% of the total harvest yield.\r\n\r\nConversion from coppice and coppice with standards into timber forest,\r\nand change from clearing systems to natural regeneration (proper for\r\nmountain forest), and from pure to mixed forest have become general\r\nprovisions of the working plans.\r\n\r\nThe average cut in the State forests during four years prior to 1893 was\r\nover 64 cub. ft. p. acre, and 42 cub. ft. for the corporation forests;\r\nan average for all the public forests of round 45 cub. ft.,--not a very\r\ngood showing as yet. So far, the collection of material for yield tables\r\nand for a statement of increment and stock on hand in the country at\r\nlarge are still insufficient, although, in 1882, Prof. Landolt estimated\r\nthe annual product at little less than 500 million cubic feet, or 50\r\ncubic feet per acre.\r\n\r\nOnly for the intensively managed city forests of Zürich and the cantonal\r\nforests of Bern are more accurate data available. In the latter, the\r\nState forests yield 50 cubic feet in the plateau country, 73 cubic feet,\r\nin the middle country, and 76 cubic feet in the Jura, while the communal\r\nforests of that canton yield 15, 66 and 56 cubic feet respectively.\r\nPrices for wood are higher in the low country than the average in\r\nGermany and have been steadily rising for the last 40 years, especially\r\nfor coniferous saw material which at present brings stumpage prices of\r\n12 to 15 cents.\r\n\r\nOwing to these high prices the gross yield of some Swiss forests is the\r\nlargest known in Europe; the city forest of Zürich, exhibiting yields of\r\n$12, and the city forest of Aarau as much as $14 per acre on the\r\naverage, although in the Alps forests the gross yield sinks to $3 and\r\n$4. The more intensively managed city forests mentioned spend on their\r\nmanagement $6 and even $7 per acre, while most of the State forests keep\r\ntheir expenditures within $2.50 to $3.50, and in some places down to\r\n$1.50 per acre. The net yields vary therefore for the State and communal\r\nforests of the plateau country between $3 and $6.50 for some of the city\r\nforests from $6.50 to $8 and $9.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland has long ago ceased to produce its wood requirements, and\r\nimports from 8 to 9 million dollars annually of wood and wood\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Education and Literature._\r\n\r\nFor the education of the higher forest officials the Federal government\r\ninstituted a two year course at the Polytechnicum at Zürich which was\r\nfounded in 1885, the course being, in 1884, increased to three years.\r\nThree professors of forestry besides the faculty of the institution in\r\nfundamental and accessory branches are active here, the number of\r\nstudents averaging in the neighborhood of thirty-five.\r\n\r\nTwo examinations, a scientific and a practical one, the latter taken\r\nbefore a special commission, tests the eligibility of candidates,\r\nforeigners not excluded, for positions. For the education of the lower\r\ngrade foresters, the Cantons themselves are responsible, the Bund only\r\ncontributing by paying for teachers and demonstration material (about\r\n$1,250) to carry on cantonal or intercantonal forestry courses. The\r\ncourses usually last from two weeks to two months, in succession or\r\ndivided into spring and fall courses; they are mainly practical, and\r\nrequire candidates to be not less than 18 years of age and to possess a\r\nprimary school education. Their number must be at least 15, and not more\r\nthan 25. There have also been instituted specially conducted excursions\r\nand progressive underforesters’ courses, as well as additional\r\nscientific courses which the Bund subsidizes.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Zürich school, forestry science and art are\r\nfurthermore advanced by a well-endowed central Forest Experiment\r\nStation, with several substations and an annual budget of $10,000.\r\n\r\nThe greatest credit for the advancement of forestry and forest\r\nlegislation is due to the Swiss Forestry Association (365 members in\r\n1911), which was founded in 1843, meeting annually in various places,\r\nmanaged by a Committee of five elected for 3 years. This Association is\r\nsubsidized by the Bund for its educational work. _Schweizerische\r\nZeitschrift für das Forstwesen_ (begun 1850) is its organ, with _Dr.\r\nFankhauser_ as editor.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, an association of underforesters with a special organ, _Der\r\nForstwirth_, came into existence (526 members in 1902), and several\r\ncantonal foresters’ associations are also active.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the literature, which is largely in German, with some French and\r\nItalian volumes, notable works have appeared and real advances in\r\nforestry science especially with reference to management of mountain\r\nforests are due to Swiss writers.\r\n\r\nIn 1767, the _Société d’Economie de Zurich_ published a foresters’\r\nmanual, and during the first quarter of the nineteenth century,\r\n_Zschokke_ and _Kasthofer_ developed silviculture in the Alps.\r\n_Landolt_, in 1860, published the results of his investigations (under\r\nthe order of the Bund of 1857) into the forest conditions of the Alps,\r\nand contributed other volumes along similar lines.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by the now venerable _Dr. J. Coaz_ as Inspector-General\r\nof the Bund (still active at 90 years of age), who also contributed to\r\nthe science of mountain reboisement and in other directions. The work on\r\nthe management of the City forest of Zürich by its long-time manager\r\n_Meister_ is classic. Under the active direction of _Anton Bühler_ for\r\nmany years, the publication of (now under _Dr. Engler_) _Mittheilungen\r\nder eidgenössischen Centralanstalt für das forstliche Versuchswesen_,\r\nsince 1891, have become important contributions to forestry science. In\r\nthe direction of wood technology the name of _L. Tetmajer_, who is\r\nconducting timber tests, should be mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  No complete monographic history of forestry in France is in\r\n  existence, and mainly incomplete notes scattered through various\r\n  volumes were at the disposal of the writer.\r\n\r\n  The work which contains the largest amount of historic information\r\n  is G. HUFFEL, _Economie Forestière_, 3 volumes, 1904-1907, pp. 422,\r\n  484, 510, perhaps the most ambitious work in the French language,\r\n  which has been largely followed in the account here given. It is a\r\n  collection of ten studies, historical data being interspersed\r\n  throughout the three volumes, the third volume containing one study\r\n  entirely historical.\r\n\r\n  L. F. A. MAURY, _Les forêts de la Gaule et de l’ancienne France_,\r\n  1867, 501 pp. is mainly descriptive, but full of interesting\r\n  historic data and detail up to the revolutionary period.\r\n\r\n  JULES CLAVÉ, _Etudes sur l’économie forestière_, 1862, 377 pp.,\r\n  12^o, while mainly a propagandist essay, rehearses to some extent\r\n  the history of forest practice, policies, etc., and gives a good\r\n  insight into conditions at that time.\r\n\r\n  _Die forstlichen Verhältnisse Frankreichs_, by Dr. A. V.\r\n  SECKENDORFF, 1879, pp. 228, furnishes a few historical notes.\r\n\r\n  Three English publications by JOHN CROUMBIE BROWN, _Pine Plantations\r\n  in France_, _Reboisement in France_, 1876; _French Forest Ordinance\r\n  of 1669_, 1882, are profuse and not entirely accurate, but give\r\n  hints of historic development.\r\n\r\n  CH. GUYOT, _L’enseignement forestier en France_, 1898, 398 pp.,\r\n  gives an insight into the development of forestry education and a\r\n  complete history of the school at Nancy, and throws much light on\r\n  other developments.\r\n\r\n  _Code de la législation forestière_, _par_ PUTON, contains all the\r\n  legislation having reference to forests.\r\n\r\n  An article on _L’idée forestière dans l’histoire_, by L. F. TESSIER,\r\n  in Revue des eaux et forêts, 1905, Jan., Feb., gives on 26 pages an\r\n  interesting brief survey of the history of forest policy in France.\r\n\r\n  _Forestry in France_, by F. BAILEY, in the _Indian Forester_, 1886,\r\n  61 pp., describes well conditions at that time.\r\n\r\nFrance is one of the countries in which forestry has been practised for\r\na long time and forestry practice has been almost as highly developed as\r\nin the preceding Teutonic countries.\r\n\r\nGermany’s neighbor to the West has evolved, however, forest policies and\r\npractices which are different in some respects from those of Germany,\r\nalthough the early history of forestry in France was largely analogous\r\nto that of Germany. Indeed, until the end of the ninth century, the two\r\ncountries being undivided, the same usages existed more or less in both,\r\nexcept that in the Gallic country Roman influence left a stronger\r\nimprint, Gallia having been long under the dominion of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe fact that France has for nearly a thousand years been a unit, while\r\nGermany has until recently been split up into many independent\r\nprincipalities, did much for uniform, albeit less ambitious, development\r\nin forestry matters.\r\n\r\nMost of the forest policy as it exists to-day was inaugurated during the\r\nmonarchical regime, which came to an end in 1871. Since that year, a\r\nrepublican form of government, with an assembly of 584, a senate of 300\r\nmembers, under a President elected by the legislature for seven years,\r\nhas been in existence.\r\n\r\nThe country is principally a plain, mostly below 1200 feet in altitude,\r\nsloping to the north and west; the mountain ranges (Pyrenées, Alps,\r\nJura, Vosges) are confined mainly to the south and east boundaries, with\r\nsecondary ranges (Cevennes, Côte d’Or, Auvergne, etc.,) in the southeast\r\npart of the country.\r\n\r\nOf the 204,000 square miles of territory, just about 18 per cent. is\r\nwooded, which, with a population of nearly 40 million, leaves only about\r\n.6 of an acre per capita.\r\n\r\nIn its present condition this area does not produce more than one-third\r\nof the home demand, which requires on the average an import in excess\r\nover export to the amount of about 25 million dollars ($33 million in\r\n1902), representing over 110 million cubic feet annually, mostly\r\nworkwood, while the export is of mine props and railroad ties at about\r\nhalf the value of the imported wood.\r\n\r\nSince, in 1892, there were still nearly 12% (over 15 million acres)\r\nwaste land, opportunity for enlargement of the forest area seems to\r\nexist. It appears that about two-thirds of this waste land is capable of\r\nbearing forest, and the existing forest area is capable of much larger\r\nproduction than the present; three quarters of the production being fuel\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of forest area is very uneven, varying from 3.5 to 56\r\nper cent. in the various departments. Only about 20% of the area is\r\nlocated on the mountains, 19% in hill country, and 60% in the plains.\r\n\r\nSix forest regions may be differentiated according to Huffel, which,\r\nhowever, are mainly geographical divisions: the northeast; valleys of\r\nSeine and Loire; northwest and central; southwest and Pyrenees;\r\nMediterranean and Pre-alps; Alps.\r\n\r\nHardwoods, oak (40%), beech and ash, etc., occupy fully 80%, while\r\npine--the two species _silvestris_ and _maritima_, largely\r\nplanted--represents the bulk of the 20% of coniferous forest area, fir,\r\nspruce and larch in the mountains forming a very small part.\r\n\r\nOnly 25% of the forest area is timber forest, 38% is coppice, and 35%\r\ncoppice with standards, 2% being in process of conversion into timber\r\nforest. In the State forests alone, however, 68% are timber forest or in\r\nprocess of conversion to that form.\r\n\r\nOf the 227 million acres, hardly more than one-third, belonging to\r\nstate and communities, are placed under the _régime forestier_, i.e.,\r\nsupervised and managed under working plans. The larger area is under\r\ncoppice.\r\n\r\nThree-fourths of the communal and one-sixth of the state’s timber forest\r\nis managed under selection system. Combinations of farm and forest\r\nculture (_sartage_ and _furetage_) are still quite extensively\r\npractised. The production of saw-timber under these practices is\r\nnaturally small. Of the 40 cubic feet of wood per acre produced in the\r\nbetter class of managed state and communal properties, only 10 cubic\r\nfeet are saw-logs, and if the private forests were taken into\r\nconsideration, the average product, on the whole would appear still\r\nsmaller, the private properties being mostly small, poorly managed, and\r\nlargely coppice. Neither the owners, nor their managers and guards have,\r\nas a rule, any professional education, although the means of obtaining\r\nit exist in the schools at Nancy and Barres.\r\n\r\nBlessed for the largest part with a most favorable climate and with rich\r\nsoil of tertiary formation, the difficulties in forestry practices\r\nexperienced by other, more northern and continental countries are hardly\r\nknown. Hence many practices which are successful in France might in\r\nGermany prove disastrous, and such yields as some of the oak forests\r\nshow, unattainable.\r\n\r\nThe greatest interest for the forester attaches to the methods of\r\nconversion of coppice into timber forest, to the extensive areas\r\nreforested during the last century, which probably exceed 3 million\r\nacres, and to the reboisement work in the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Development of Forest Property._\r\n\r\nAs in Austria, private ownership of forest property is largely\r\npreponderant, while state property is small.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Gaul, the Romans found the forest outside of holy groves as\r\ncommunal property. After the conquest, all the unseated lands,\r\nespecially the extensive mountain forests, were declared either State or\r\nimperial property--more than half the whole territory--and were managed\r\nas _res publica_ by the administrators of public affairs. And while\r\nlater, with the advent of the German hordes, property conditions shaped\r\nthemselves somewhat according to their ways, the influence of the Roman\r\nlaw and institutions were never quite eradicated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe country, outside of the public property, was by the Romans divided\r\ninto communities, called _fundus_, each placed under a Gallic seigneur\r\n(_eques_), a former chief, now proprietor, his tribesmen and the\r\nremnants of the earlier sessile population becoming serfs. One-third of\r\nthe _fundus_ was handed to the serfs as their property and divided among\r\nthem--the first private property--; another third was retained by the\r\nseigneur and utilized by means of the service of the serfs (_corvées_),\r\nbut usually also burdened by rights of user on their part; and the last\r\nthird became common property of the community at large. There remained,\r\nhowever, here and there, also, some of the original free communes or\r\nMark (_vicus_), so that five different property classes were in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe 5th century saw the Teutonic tribes, Suevi, Alani, Vandals and\r\nBurgundians, overwhelm the Romans, who had for 500 years kept the\r\nGallo-Celtic population under their rule; and these were followed by\r\nVisigoths and Franks, who in turn took possession of the country. The\r\nconquerors did not drive out the Gallo-Romans, but merely quartered\r\nthemselves on them under the euphemistic title of “guests,” assuming to\r\nthemselves two-thirds of each estate, and leaving the remainder to their\r\n“hosts.” On these lands, undoubtedly, similar economic and social\r\ninstitutions were developed as in Germany. Communal ownership under\r\nthese was at first developed to such an extent that the Salic laws\r\ndeclared all trees which were not reserved by special sign as subject to\r\nthe use of all and any of the Markers. But later, as in Germany, the\r\nsocialistic Mark was followed by the feudal system with its ban forests\r\nand the creation of great landed proprietors or lords.\r\n\r\nWhen Clovis, the king of the Franks, in the first decade of the 6th\r\ncentury defeated the Visigoths and took possession of the country (see\r\np. 29), he found communal forests of the villagers (_vicus_), property\r\nof seigneurs (_equites_), royal forests and State forests, remnants of\r\nRoman origin. The latter properties and much of the Mark forests he\r\nclaimed for himself and divided two-thirds among his vassals; but the\r\nlarger part of the other third became also gradually property of the\r\nnobility and church, so that, by the 12th century, only a relatively\r\nsmall royal property remained. Afterwards, the royal or State property\r\ngrew again in various ways, as the power of the kings grew. In 1539,\r\nFrancis I declared the same inalienable. But neither himself nor his\r\nsuccessors paid heed to this self-imposed prohibition and, whenever\r\nfinancial troubles made it expedient, they disposed of some of their\r\nholdings.\r\n\r\nBy the ordinance of 1566 (_Edit de Moulins_), King Charles IX again\r\ndeclared the domain of the crown inalienable. Nevertheless he himself in\r\nthe same year, and repeatedly afterwards, sold parts of his domain.\r\nHenry III, in 1579, renewed the ordinance of non-alienation and restored\r\nsome of the last parcels to the domain by the exercise of the royal\r\nright. Himself and his successors, however, continually broke this\r\ncontract, and the royal domain decreased while that of the seigneurs\r\ngrew. Similarly to what happened in Germany, the church property was\r\ntaken by machination or force to increase the holdings of kings or\r\nseigneurs. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the revolution in 1789, the\r\nroyal domain comprised not more than 1,200,000 acres, producing a net\r\nincome of 1.2 million dollars. Then followed an era of ups and downs,\r\ncontinuous changes of policy, increases and decreases of the property\r\nuntil with the inauguration of the republic, in 1871, comparative\r\nstability was secured.\r\n\r\nIn 1791, after the revolution, the royal property became national\r\ndomain, and by further spoliation of church property, and otherwise,\r\nattained an area of 4,300,000 acres. In the law of 1791, a distinction\r\nwas made between the inalienable domain, which comprises roads, canals,\r\nfortresses, harbors, etc., and the alienable national domain, including\r\nthe forest and other property derived from royal or crown domains. To\r\nthis national domain was added, by the law of 1792, the forest property\r\nof the refugees of the revolution which was, however, later for the most\r\npart restored or indemnified. Finally, when, by the treaty of Basel\r\n(1795), the French frontier had been pushed to the Rhine, the total\r\nstate forest had grown to around 6,500,000 acres, nearly one-third of\r\nthe total forest area.\r\n\r\nBut, through sales and otherwise, this area had, by 1815, been reduced\r\nto 3,200,000 acres, and during the period until 1872, the area had been\r\nfurther again reduced to less than 2,500,000 acres. At present (1905) it\r\ncomprises 2.9 million acres, or less than 12 per cent., of the total\r\nforest area, 55 per cent. of which comes from the original royal domain,\r\n22 per cent. from original church property and 23 per cent. from recent\r\nacquisitions, secured under the laws of reboisement of mountains, sand\r\ndunes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe communal property developed largely in a similar manner as in\r\nGermany, from the Mark, and through the feudal system, with its rights\r\nof user as a result. In the twelfth century, the grandees or seigneurs\r\nwere active in colonizing their domains, acquired as fiefs or otherwise,\r\nwith serfs and others, giving them charters for villages with communal\r\nprivileges and rights. Under this method, another kind of communal\r\nforest property grew up, by written instruments or contracts, in which\r\nlimitations and reservations of rights are imposed by the seigneurs. One\r\nof the most usual conditions of the contract was the prevention of\r\nclearing or sale; at the same time a new set of rights of user, this\r\ntime on the part of the seigneur, brought new complications. One of the\r\nworst features originating in the 14th century as an outgrowth of feudal\r\nrelations, was “the right of the third” (_triage_), which gave to the\r\nseigneur, whenever he wished to exercise it, one-third of the property\r\nfree of all rights of user. In this way, the communal area was\r\ndiminished until, in 1667, the widespread abuse of this right led to an\r\nordinance abolishing it. It was, however, re-established by the\r\nordinance of 1669 in all cases where the forest had been gratuitously\r\nceded by the seigneurs, or when the remaining two-thirds was deemed\r\nsufficient for the needs of the parish. Not until 1790-1792 was this\r\nexorbitant right finally abolished.\r\n\r\nAs an outgrowth of the revolutionary doctrine of 1793, the most radical\r\nlegislation decreed presumptive ownership by the municipal corporations\r\nof all lands for which the claimant could not show a deed of purchase,\r\nexcluding any title acquired as a result of feudal relations. The day of\r\nrevenge of all old wrongs had come, and, appeal to justice being\r\nuseless, the municipalities increased their holdings freely. Although\r\nlater legislation attempted to arrest this public theft and to restitute\r\nsome of the stolen property, much of the communal forest area of to-day\r\nconsists of this kind of ill-gotten property.\r\n\r\nAnother method of increasing municipal properties was by exchange of\r\nterritory for the rights of user. Efforts to get rid of these rights,\r\nwhich grew up as described and to prevent their extension were\r\ninstituted much earlier than in Germany, Philip of Valois expressly\r\nforbidding such extension as early as 1346. Nevertheless they continued\r\nto grow so that, by the middle of the 18th century, they were as general\r\nand afforded as great a hindrance to forest management, as in Germany.\r\nThe ordinance of 1669 also provided for the extinction of these rights,\r\napparently without much success, and the troublesome times after 1789\r\nincreased their number. Only when the orderly regime following the reign\r\nof Napoleon gave rise to the Code Forestier (1827), was a systematic\r\nattempt for their extinguishment by the cession of territory and cash\r\npayment begun, and by this time the extinction may be considered\r\npractically concluded, at least for the state and communal property.\r\n\r\nPrivate property, not seignorial, was but little developed before the\r\n16th century; after that the frequent sales by the kings and barons gave\r\nrise to small forest owners, so that, by 1789, over 10 million acres\r\nwere in such possession. During the 19th century this grew by purchase,\r\nby cessions, and by reforestation of waste lands to double that amount,\r\nnot less than two million acres being added by the latter cause alone,\r\nwhile some decrease came from clearings.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, private holdings comprised 15 million acres or 65 per cent. of\r\nthe total; the communal and institutional forests 4.8 million acres or\r\n21 per cent., leaving for State forest 2.9 million acres, or a little\r\nover 12 per cent. of the total of 22.7 million acres. Twenty-two per\r\ncent. of state and communal property is, however, waste land, and such\r\nareas in private hands may be six times as large; there being altogether\r\nbetween 14 and 15 million acres of waste lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Development of Forest Administration._\r\n\r\nIn the earlier times, and, indeed, into the 18th century, the most\r\nimportant use of the forest was in the mast from oak and beech for the\r\npigs and pasture for the cattle, besides firewood, for which mostly the\r\nsoft woods were used. This was given free from the royal domain, and the\r\nadministration consisted mainly in regulating this use. The main\r\nincentive for the regulation of forest use on the part of the king were\r\nthe interests of the chase.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the ninth century, special forest officers,\r\n_forestarii_, are mentioned in Charlemagne’s celebrated _capitularium_,\r\nwhich describes in detail the administration of the public domains.\r\nThese were, to be sure, only lower rank officials, working under mayors,\r\nintendants and the count (_comes_), who was the administrator and soon\r\nindependent arbiter of the royal domain as well as of the administration\r\nof justice in general. His office early became hereditary.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of “forest masters” (_maîtres des eaux et forêts_)\r\ndates back to 1291, and later ordinances mention higher officials. But\r\nthe credit for a full and detail organization and regulation of\r\nmanagement belongs to Charles V, the wise Valois, in his ordinance of\r\n1376. This organization, after various changes, by the end of the 16th\r\ncentury, under the reign of Henry IV, took about the following form:\r\n\r\nUnder a general superintendent of forests, titulary head of the forest\r\nservice, a number of _grands maîtres_, _généraux réformateurs des eaux\r\net forêts_, some 17, were appointed by the King to watch over the\r\nconduct of the _maîtres_ and _gruyers_, officers in charge of the forest\r\ndistricts (_maîtrises_). All of these officials had their deputies and\r\nlieutenants under various designations (_procureur du roi_, _greffier_,\r\n_gardemarteau_, _sergent du garde_, etc.)\r\n\r\nA stamping hammer (kept by the _gardemarteau_) was employed for marking\r\ntrees which defined the boundaries, or which were to be reserved in the\r\nfellings. In addition to these regular officers there were employed a\r\ngreat number of _capitaines des chasses_ whose functions, as the title\r\nindicates, related mainly to the chase. The function of the\r\nforestmasters did not stop with the supervision of the use of the forest\r\nand sale of wood, but included also the jurisdiction of all misdemeanors\r\nand crimes committed in the royal, and later, in all forests. They\r\nbecame thus gradually a privileged class of immense power. Graft and\r\nsale of offices became the order of the day. Sometimes the offices were\r\nmade hereditary, and again were limited to three or four years’ tenure,\r\nin the endeavour to break up the shameful practices. For nearly three\r\ncenturies all efforts at reform were failures.\r\n\r\nThe method of prescribing the rules and regulations during the 12th to\r\n17th century was by ordinances like those issued by the German princes;\r\nthe first ordinance on record being that issued by Louis VI in 1215.\r\nThese ordinances usually appeared under the name _Le fait des eaux et\r\nforêts_ (the matters of waters and woods), curiously enough thus\r\nsuggesting the relation of the two. The latter term was used exactly\r\nlike that of the German _Forst_, designating the reserved territory\r\nunder the ban, while _bois_ is used to designate actual woodland\r\n(silva).\r\n\r\nIn 1376, Charles V, in his endeavor to build up a navy against England,\r\nmade reservations for naval timber and also issued the ordinance of\r\nMelun, a general forest code, the provisions of which lasted largely\r\nuntil the reform of 1669. In 1402, the many ordinances, often\r\ncontradictory were codified under one text, and another codification was\r\nmade under Francis I in 1515.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the 17th century the devastation of forests had\r\nprogressed so far, and the abuses in the management of the royal domain\r\nhad become so evident that Louis XIV’s great minister, _Colbert_, was\r\ninduced to make the historical remark “France will perish for lack of\r\nwoods.” Again the needs of the navy was the prime incentive of the\r\nvigorous reform which he instituted after a most searching\r\ninvestigation. The result was the celebrated forest ordinance of 1669.\r\nFor this purpose he appointed, in 1662, a commission which not only\r\ninvestigated conditions but was clothed with power to reform the abuses\r\nwhich it might discover. For this work he selected four trusted men\r\noutside of the forest service, to whom later more were added, and gave\r\nthem the aid of technical advisers, among whom _Froudoir_ seems to have\r\nbeen most prominent. Colbert himself gave close attention to this work\r\nof reform. As the first act, the commission recommended the ceasing of\r\nall cutting in the royal forests, and, after deliberation and\r\nconsultation with interested parties through eight years, the final law\r\nwas enacted, a masterpiece whose principles and prescriptions to an\r\nextent have persisted into the 19th century. The commission from time to\r\ntime made reports, giving their findings in detail, and these form a\r\nmost interesting record of conditions prevailing at that time. As one of\r\nthe historians (Joubain) puts it, “the commissioners did not recoil\r\nbefore long hours of inspection nor high influence, they neither\r\nhesitated to declare against, nor prosecute, great and small alike, nor\r\nto pronounce a most serious sentence.” A thorough cleaning up was done\r\nand a complete reorganization secured.\r\n\r\nBy this ordinance, three special courts of adjudication in matters\r\npertaining to the forests were established, with special officers whose\r\nduties were carefully defined, namely the courts of the _Gruries_, of\r\nthe _Maîtrises_ and the _Tables de Marbre_. The first named, lower grade\r\ncourts took cognizance of the lesser offences, abuses, wastes and\r\nmalversations, disputes in regard to fishing or chase, and murders\r\narising out of these; _gruries_ being the woods belonging to individuals\r\nin which the jurisdiction and the profit from such jurisdiction belonged\r\nto the king, or at least to the seigneurs. The courts of the maîtrise\r\nreferred to the forest territory placed under administration of the\r\n_maîtres particuliers_ (Forstmeister), and were established near the\r\nmany royal forests as courts of appeal in forest matters. A final appeal\r\ncould be made to the _tables de marbre_ (courts of the marble table),\r\nwhich also decided on the more weighty questions of proprietorship by\r\nwhatever term held, and especially civil and criminal cases relating to\r\nthe _eaux et forêts_; the wrong doings in the discharge of official\r\nduties (_abus_), contraventions to the orders and regulations,\r\nmisdemeanors or depredations (_délit_); and all kinds of fraud not\r\nincluded under those cited (_malversations_).\r\n\r\nThe whole country was divided into 18 arrondissements of\r\n_grandes-maîtrises des eaux et forêts_ and these were divided into 134\r\n_maîtrises_, each under a _maître particulier_, with a _lieutenant_, a\r\n_garde-marteau_, a _garde général_, two _arpenteurs_ and a number of\r\n_gardes_. A financial branch for the handling of moneys, and the\r\njudicial branch represented by the three courts described above,\r\ncompleted the organization, which lasted until the revolution, albeit\r\nsome details were changed soon after its enactment, and the offices\r\nbecame again purchaseable and hereditary.\r\n\r\nThe sale of royal forests was again forbidden, penalties being provided\r\nfor the eventual purchaser. Theft and incendiarism were severely\r\npunished, and specific rules of management were established.\r\n\r\nClearings could only be made by permission even on the part of private\r\nowners. The methods of sale and harvest were determined. The\r\nprescriptions of older ordinances were renewed to the effect that at\r\nleast 13 to 16 seed trees (_baliveaux_) per acre in the coppice, and 8\r\nseed trees in timber forest, were to be reserved in all forests without\r\nexception. Private owners were not to cut these seed trees before they\r\nwere 40 years old in the coppice, and 120 years in the timber forest,\r\nwhile in the public and church forests these seed trees were treated\r\nlike reserves. Similarly, the prescription that no woods were to be cut\r\nbefore 10 years of age was revived from former ordinances, the time\r\nlater (1787) being increased for public forests to 25 years. Also the\r\nobligation to keep one-fourth of the forest in reserve, which Charles IX\r\nhad decreed in 1560, was renewed for the public forests (those belonging\r\nto corporations and other public institutions). For the fir forests of\r\nthe mountains, which had become important as furnishers of ship masts,\r\nspecial regulations were issued, and the mast timber reserved for the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nThere was lively opposition to the enforcement of these prescriptions,\r\nespecially where they interfered with property rights, nevertheless they\r\npersisted until the changes brought about by the revolution of 1789.\r\n\r\nCertain prescriptions, as for instance the exclusion of sheepherding\r\nwere never enforced, and this practice continues even to-day in certain\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the reform, however, the revenues from the royal forests\r\ntrebled in 20 years.\r\n\r\nDuring the 18th century, several famines occurred and led to the\r\nencouragement of extending farm operations at the expense of the forest,\r\nnotably in the sixties, when among other similar efforts some 200\r\nfamilies returning from Canada after the English conquest were colonized\r\nin the forests of Poitou. At that time, also the “declaration” of 1766\r\nexempted those who cleared land for farm purposes for 15 years from all\r\ntaxes. As a result of this invitation some 750,000 acres were cleared,\r\nand the practice of clearing for farm use continued until the middle of\r\nthe 19th century. In this way, by inconsiderately exposing soil which\r\nwould not everywhere be found adapted to farm use, wastes naturally\r\nexisting were greatly increased.\r\n\r\nThe revolution brought with it sudden and disastrous changes. The law of\r\n1791 abolished not only the jurisdiction of the _maîtrises_, but removed\r\nall restraint, and thereby inaugurated widespread destruction and\r\ndevastation of forest property against which legislative attempts of the\r\nrepublican government were entirely powerless. Not only did the peasants\r\ntake advantage of the disorder, and the municipalities cut their\r\nreserves without hindrance but extraordinary fellings in the state\r\nforests were necessitated by the needs of the navy and the exchequer. In\r\n1801, after various previous attempts at organization, Napoleon\r\nreorganized the service, with five administrators, 30 conservators, 200\r\ninspectors and 8,600 inferior officers. At that time, it appears that\r\nthe revenue from the public forest domain amounted to $6,000,000, a sum\r\njustifying such elaborate organization. But otherwise the methods of\r\nColbert’s ordinance were revived. Devastation, however, continued.\r\n\r\nIncompetence in the service, was again introduced when in 1811 half the\r\nnumber of officials was recruited from superannuated army officers. In\r\n1817, the whole forest service was abolished, and the properties placed\r\nin the hands of the fiscal agents of the government without any\r\ntechnical knowledge. The old order of things was, however,\r\nre-established in 1820, and soon after the final organization which has\r\nlasted to date was effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Development of Modern Forest Policy._\r\n\r\nIn 1822, a commission composed of foresters was instituted to revise the\r\nordinance of 1669, which, here and there modified, had continued to be\r\nvalid, except during the revolutionary period. The result of the work of\r\nthis commission was the _Code Forestier_ (1829) which is the law of the\r\npresent day. In it, principles are laid down under which the state,\r\ncommunal and other public forests are to be managed.\r\n\r\nAll forests submitted to the _régime forestier_, namely, the state and\r\ncommunal forests and those belonging to public institutions, are\r\nentirely managed by the state forest administration, the communities or\r\nother public forest owners paying for the service not to exceed 9 cents\r\nper acre, or 5 per cent. of the revenue. All jurisdiction and execution\r\nof forestry laws is in the hands of the officials of the Forest\r\nAdministration. The foresters of the state have the exclusive\r\nresponsibility of making and executing working plans, without\r\ninterference by the municipalities after the plans have once been\r\nsubmitted and approved by them. The corporations have not even the right\r\nto appoint their own guards, all such being appointed by the prefects of\r\nthe departments upon recommendation by the forest department.\r\n\r\nThe fellings, usually performed by the purchaser, (the wood being sold\r\non the stump), are supervised most rigorously, making even the smallest\r\ndeviations from the conditions of the contract sale, which otherwise\r\nwould only entail the payment of damage, punishable by fine; and the\r\nresponsibility for any trespass which may occur on the land reaches 250\r\nyards beyond the limits of the purchaser’s territory, unless he gives\r\nproper warning and tries to find out the perpetrators of the same. Legal\r\nproceedings are brought before the courts of correction, and are greatly\r\nsimplified, as is customary in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe public forests may not be sold, mortgaged or divided, and the\r\nproduct can be sold only through state foresters. As in the olden times,\r\none-quarter of the stands in the timber forests, and one-fourth of the\r\nfelling budget in the coppice is placed in reserve for urgent or\r\nunforeseen needs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these and other restrictions which refer to the _public_\r\nforests, there are prescriptions which apply to _all_ woods in general.\r\nAll foresters employed, even on private properties, have sheriff’s\r\npower. Walking in the woods with axe, saw and wagon outside of the\r\npublic roads which pass through them, is forbidden; the making of fires\r\nis forbidden; the making of fire lines, 20 yards wide, between private\r\nforests can be enforced by either owner, and railroads, along their\r\nrights of way, are required to make such. By special law of 1893, the\r\nsetting of fires even within 200 yards of a wood is forbidden in certain\r\nregions, and the punishment of infractions of these laws is very severe.\r\n\r\nThe rights of user are gauged by the administration according to the\r\npossible yield, even in private forests, and are surrounded by many\r\nother restrictions; the wood falling under such rights of user is cut\r\nand delivered by the forest agents, and the rights can be forcibly\r\nextinguished by exchange of territory.\r\n\r\nThe supervision of the communal forests which had, indeed, existed since\r\nthe 16th century was by no means an easy task. The opposition to it\r\nwhich had always existed and was, in earlier times, justified by the\r\nincompetence and graft of the officials, continued even after this\r\njustification of it had ceased. Thanks to the tact and efficiency of the\r\nofficials of the modern period, the opposition has been largely\r\novercome, and, thanks to the progress made in enforcing these rigorous\r\nlaws, their necessity has almost vanished, and, at present, relatively\r\nfew infractions need to be investigated and punished. Moreover, the\r\nrigor of the original law was somewhat abated by the law of 1859.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, voices which proclaim that the supervision by the\r\ngovernment is not as thorough as it should be, and that the conditions\r\nof the communal property have deteriorated.\r\n\r\nWhile the supervision of the management of communal property is mainly\r\nbased on fiscal considerations, the _Code forestier_ also authorizes the\r\nadministration to interfere in the management of forests whose influence\r\non the public welfare can be demonstrated.\r\n\r\nIn order to assure the possibility of such interference, every private\r\nowner who desires to clear land is required to advise the government of\r\nhis purpose, when the administration can prevent such clearing, if\r\ndeemed necessary to prevent landslides, erosion and torrential action,\r\nto protect watersources, sand dunes, _for defensive purposes at the\r\nfrontier_ (!), and for public health. Otherwise, the management of\r\nprivate forest is unhampered.\r\n\r\nBy special legislation, enacted in 1860 and 1882, however, the special\r\ncases of torrential action were taken care of in a special manner, which\r\nwill be set forth in following pages. The reboisement law of 1882\r\nauthorizes the administration to acquire by expropriation mountain\r\nforests or mountain slopes needed for reforestation for the sake of\r\nsafeguarding them and preventing torrential damage.\r\n\r\nFor Algiers, the same authorization to expropriate was extended by law\r\nof 1903 to include all such areas on which according to the _Code\r\nforestier_ the administration might forbid clearing, and such extension\r\nis advocated for the mother country.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the administration has been able to avoid expropriation and\r\nsecure the territories by voluntary sale at less than $10 per acre.\r\n\r\nAt present, the forest service is under the Minister of Agriculture as\r\nPresident of the Forestry Council, with a Director-General as Vice\r\nPresident and technical head, and three _Administrateurs Vérificateurs\r\ngénéraux_, chiefs of the three bureaux into which the administration is\r\ndivided, each with two chiefs of sections, Inspectors, and the necessary\r\noffice staff. For purposes of the local administration the forest area\r\nis divided into 32 conservations, each under charge of a _Conservateur_\r\nequivalent to the German Oberforstmeister. These are again subdivided\r\ninto _Chefferies_ or _Inspections_, two to twelve in each conservation,\r\nwhich are administrative units, under the supervision of Inspectors\r\n(200) and Assistant Inspectors (210). In addition, a special service for\r\nforest-organization and reboisement employs 14 inspectors and some 20\r\nassistants. The forest districts or _cantonments_ (ranges) finally are\r\nunder the direct charge of _Gardes généraux_ (162), with the assistance\r\nof _Gardes généraux stagiaires_ (67) and underforesters or guards\r\n(_Brigadiers_) (3,650); altogether a personnel of over 4,400 officials.\r\nWhile this is a larger force per acreage, yet the expense for personnel\r\nper acre is less than one-half that of the Prussian forest\r\nadministration, and one-quarter of that in several of the other German\r\nstate administrations.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, a reorganization was effected improving to some extent the\r\nsalaries.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of 1909 also further strengthens State influence by\r\nplacing certain private properties under the control of the\r\nAdministration, and allowing the latter to undertake the management of\r\nprivate properties at the request of owners for a consideration.\r\n\r\nThe budget for 1911 places the total expenditure for the Forest\r\nAdministration at 3 million dollars (98 cents per acre), of which\r\n950,000 for reboisement and other improvement work. The receipts for the\r\nlast five years have averaged near 7 million dollars, so that a net\r\nresult of $1.60 per acre seems attained, considering the expense of\r\nreboisement as new investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Work of Reforestation._\r\n\r\nThe most noted work of the forest administration, and one for which it\r\ndeserves high credit, has been that of the reclamation of waste lands,\r\nof which, in 1879, it was estimated there were still 20,000,000 acres\r\nin extent. Especially the “reboisement” work in the Alpine districts, as\r\na result of the law of 1882, has become celebrated.\r\n\r\nThe movement for recovery of waste lands dates from the beginning of the\r\n19th century, and to-day reforestation by state, communal and private\r\neffort encouraged by legislative acts during the last sixty years, has\r\nrestored well-nigh more than 3,000,000 acres of ground which had been\r\nlost to forest production.\r\n\r\nThere are four definite regions of large extent in which systematic\r\neffort in this direction has been made, namely, the sand dunes of\r\nGascony and the Landes of Southwestern France; the sandy plains of La\r\nSologne; the limestone wastes of Champagne; and the mountain slopes in\r\nthe Vosges and Jura-Alps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sand dunes on the coast of France comprise around 350,000 acres;\r\nthose on the coast of Gascony in Southwest France alone have an extent\r\nof nearly 250,000 acres, these being the most important and having for a\r\nlong time endangered the adjoining pastures and fields. It seems that\r\nthe land occupied by dunes was originally forested, and that these were\r\ncreated by deforestation.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1717, successful attempts at reforestation were made by the\r\ninhabitants of _La Teste_, and from that time on sporadically small\r\nplantings came into existence. But the inauguration of systematic\r\nreforestation was begun only after a notable report by _Brémontier_,\r\nwho, in 1786, secured, as chief engineer of the department of Bordeaux,\r\na sum of $10,000 to be employed in ascertaining the possibilities of\r\ndraining the Landes by means of a canal, and of fixing the dunes. As a\r\nresult of this beginning, the method for their recovery having been, by\r\n1793, experimentally determined by Brémontier, 275,000 acres of moving\r\nsand have been fixed during the last century. The revolutionary\r\ngovernment, in 1799, created a Commission of Dunes, of which Brémontier\r\nwas made president, and annual appropriation of $10,000 was made, later\r\n(in 1808) increased to $15,000. In 1817, the work was transferred to the\r\n_Administration des Ponts et Chaussées_. The appropriations were\r\nincreased until, in 1854, they reached $100,000 a year, and in 1865, the\r\nwork being nearly finished, the dunes were handed over to the forest\r\nadministration. There being still about 20,000 acres to be recovered,\r\nthis was achieved in 1865, when 200,000 acres had been reforested at an\r\nexpense of about $2,000,000, and an additional expense of $700,000 to\r\norganize the newly formed pine forests--_Pinus maritima_ was entirely\r\nused. These, at present, with their resinous products and wood are\r\nfurnishing valuable material. An unfortunate policy of ceding some of\r\nthese forest areas to private and communal owners, who claimed them as\r\nof ancient right, and also of sales was inaugurated just as the planting\r\nwas finished, so that at present only 125,000 acres remain in the hands\r\nof the state. The returns from the sales, however, reimbursed the cost\r\nof the reboisement in excess by $140,000, so that the state really\r\nacquired for nothing, a property, now estimated to be worth\r\n$10,000,000.\r\n\r\nA similar plantation on moving sands, of 35,000 acres, is found north of\r\nthis tract.\r\n\r\nTo the eastward of this region of dunes stretch the so-called _Landes_,\r\na territory triangular in shape, containing 2,000,000 acres of shifting\r\nsands and marshes, on which a poor population of shepherds (on stilts)\r\nused to eke out a living. In 1873, _Chambrelent_, an engineer of the\r\nadministration of bridges and roads (_administration des ponts et\r\nchaussées_), conceived the idea of improving this section by\r\nreforestation, and at his own expense recovered some 1,200 acres in the\r\nworst marsh by ditching and planting. The success of this plantation\r\ninvited imitators, and, by 1855, the reforested area had grown to 50,000\r\nacres. This led, in 1857, to the passage of a law ordering forestation\r\nof the parts of the land owned by the state as well as by the\r\ncommunities, the state at the same time undertaking the expense of\r\nbuilding a system of roads and making the plans for forestation free of\r\ncharge. The communities were allowed to sell a part of the reclaimed\r\nland in order to recover the expense, and sold some 470,000 acres for\r\n2.7 million dollars, of which less than $300,000 were used to forest the\r\n250,000 acres belonging to them. From 1850 to 1892, private owners\r\nimitating the government and communal work, altogether nearly 1,750,000\r\nacres were covered with pine forest at a cost of $4.00 to $5.00 per\r\nacre, or, including the building of roads, for a total expenditure of\r\naround $10,000,000. In 1877, the value of the then recovered area was\r\nestimated at over $40,000,000, this figure being arrived at by\r\ncalculating the possible net revenues of a pinery under a 75 years\r\nrotation, which was figured at $2.50 per acre, with a production of 51\r\ncubic feet per acre and 200 quarts of resin (at $3). An estimate of\r\nrecent date places the value of the recovered area at $100,000,000.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCentrally located between the valleys of the Loire and the Cher, near\r\nOrleans, lies the region of _La Sologne_, a sandy, poorly drained plain\r\nupon an impenetrable calcareous sub-soil giving rise to stagnant waters;\r\nthis region too had been originally densely wooded, and was described as\r\na paradise in early times; but from the beginning of the 17th century to\r\nthe end of the 18th it was deforested, making it an unhealthy, useless\r\nwaste. By 1787, 1,250,000 acres of this territory had become absolutely\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the 19th century, a number of influential citizens\r\nconstituted themselves a committee to begin its work of recovery, the\r\nDirector General of Forests being authorized to assume the presidency of\r\nthat committee. As a result, a canal 25 miles in length and 350 miles of\r\nroad were built, and some 200,000 acres, all non-agricultural lands,\r\nwere sowed and planted with Maritime and Scotch Pine, the state\r\nfurnishing assistance through the forest service and otherwise. A\r\nset-back occurred during the severe winter of 1879, frost killing many\r\nof the younger plantations, which led to the substitution of the hardier\r\nScotch Pine for the Maritime Pine in the plantings. The cost per acre\r\nset out with about 3,500 two-year old seedlings amounted to $5.00. An\r\nestimate of the value of these plantations places it at, not less than\r\n$18,000,000, so that lands which 50 years ago, could hardly be sold for\r\n$4.00 per acre, now bring over $3.00 as an annual revenue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the province of _Champagne_, South of Rheims, a plain of arid\r\nlime-stone wastes of an extent which in the 18th century had reached\r\n1,750,000 acres is found. About 1807, the movement for the recovery of\r\nthese wastes began; first in a small way, gaining strength by 1830 after\r\nsome sporadic experiments had shown the possibility of reforestation,\r\nand to-day over 200,000 acres of coniferous forest (mainly Austrian and\r\nScotch Pine), largely planted by private incentive, are in existence,\r\nthe better acres being farmed. It is interesting to note that land which\r\n50 years ago was often sold without measurement by distance, “as far as\r\nthe cry would carry,” and rarely for more than $4.00 per acre, is to-day\r\nworth over $40.00 at a cost for planting of less than $25.00. The\r\nstumpage value of a thirty years’ growth is figured at from $50 to $100,\r\nthe total forest area is valued at $10,000,000, with net revenue from\r\nthe 200,000 acres at $2.00 per acre.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrance is unfortunate in having within her territory, although so little\r\nmountainous, the largest proportion of the area in Europe liable to\r\ntorrential action. Not less than 1,462 brooks and mountain streams have\r\nbeen counted as dangerous waters in the Alps, the Cevennes, and the\r\nPyrenees mountains; or two-thirds of the torrents of Europe. An area\r\nnearly 1,000,000 acres in extent, of mountain slopes, is exposed to the\r\nravages of these waters by erosion.\r\n\r\nHere the most forcible demonstration of the value of a forest cover in\r\nprotecting watersheds was furnished by the results of the extensive\r\nforest destruction and devastation which took place especially during\r\nand following the years of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nLong ago, in the 16th century, the local parliaments had enacted decrees\r\nagainst clearing in the mountains, with severe fines, confiscation and\r\neven corporal punishment, and these restrictions had been generally\r\neffective; but during the Revolutionary period all these wholesome\r\nrestrictions vanished; inconsiderate exploitation by the farmers began,\r\nand the damage came so rapidly that in less than ten years after the\r\nbeginning of freedom, the effect was felt. Within three years (1792),\r\nthe first complaints of the result of unrestricted cutting were heard,\r\nand, by 1803, they were quite general. The brooks had changed to\r\ntorrents, inundating the plains, tearing away fertile lands or silting\r\nthem over with the debris carried down from the mountains. Yet in spite\r\nof these early warnings and the theoretical discussions by such men as\r\nBoussingault, Becquerel and others, the destructive work by axe, fire\r\nand over-pasturing progressed until about 8,000,000 acres of tillable\r\nland had been rendered more or less useless, and the population of 18\r\ndepartments had been impoverished or reduced in number by emigration.\r\n\r\nA young engineer, _Surell_, was the first to study the possibility of\r\ncoping with the evil and proved in his _Etude sur les torrents_, in\r\n1841, its relation to forest cover, and the need of attacking it at the\r\nsources. The first work of recovery was tentatively begun in 1843, but\r\nthe political events following did not promote its extension, until, in\r\n1860, a special law charged the Forest Department with the mission of\r\nextinguishing the torrents. There were recognized two categories of\r\nwork, the one, considered of general public interest being designated as\r\nobligatory, the other with less immediate need being facultative; the\r\nterritories devastated by each river and its affluents on which the work\r\nof recovery was to be executed were known as perimeters. In the\r\nobligatory perimeters, private lands were to be acquired by the state by\r\nprocess of expropriation, the communal properties were to be only for a\r\ntime occupied by the state and after the achievement of the recovery\r\nwere to be restituted on payment of the expense of the work; or else the\r\ncorporation could get rid of the debt by ceding one-half of its property\r\nto the state.\r\n\r\nIn the facultative perimeters, the state was simply to assist in the\r\nwork of recovery by gratuitous distribution of seeds and plants, or even\r\nby money subventions in some cases. It appeared hard that the poor\r\nmountaineers should have to bear all the expense of the extinction of\r\nthe torrents, and much complaint was heard. In response to these\r\ncomplaints, in 1864, a law was passed allowing the substitution of\r\nsodding instead of forest planting for at least part of the perimeters,\r\nwith a view of securing pastures; but this method seems not to have been\r\nsuccessful and was mostly not employed.\r\n\r\nFinally, by the reboisement law of 1882, the complaints of the\r\nmountaineers were properly taken care of by placing the entire expense\r\nof the reboisement work on the state. The attitude of the mountaineers,\r\nwhich was at first hostile, due to the restriction of the pasture, has\r\nbeen overcome by the beneficial results of the work, and now the most\r\nhostile are ready to offer gratuitously their territory to the Forest\r\nDepartment. Wherever necessary the state has bought territory, and from\r\nyear to year has increased its holdings, and continues to acquire land\r\nat the rate of 25,000 to 30,000 acres per year, the budget of 1902, for\r\ninstance, containing $1,000,000 for this purpose; that of 1911, only\r\n$40,000.\r\n\r\nAltogether the state had, up to 1900, acquired 400,000 acres, of which\r\n218,000 have been planted, and it is estimated that about 430,000 acres\r\nmore will have to be acquired. The total expense, outside of subventions\r\nto communities and private owners, up to 1900 has been over $13,000,000,\r\nof which somewhat over $5,000,000 was expended for purchases, it is\r\nestimated that round $25 to $30 million more will be needed to complete\r\nthe work. Of the 1,462 torrents there were in 1893, 163 entirely\r\ncontrolled, and 654 begun to be “cured.” Among the former, there were 31\r\nwhich 50 years ago were considered by engineers incurable. It is\r\nestimated that, with the expenditure of $600,000 per annum, the work may\r\nbe finished by 1945. The names of Matthieu and Demontzey, especially the\r\nlatter, are indelibly connected with this great work.\r\n\r\nLately, however, Briot in his classical work _Les Alpes françaises_\r\ncriticizes severely as improperly extravagant the large expenditures in\r\nplaces where the result does not warrant them, and proclaims as illusory\r\nsome of the methods adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Forestry Science and Practice._\r\n\r\nUntil the 16th century, whatever regulations had been issued regarding\r\nforest use were merely of administrative or police character and had\r\nnothing to do with management or silviculture, except perhaps so far as\r\nthe number of _baliveaux_, reserved trees to be left, might be\r\nconsidered as bearing upon the subject. The _réformateurs_ who were from\r\ntime to time appointed had to deal only with judicial questions and\r\nabuses; and usually the ordinances referred only to special forests, but\r\nin 1563, the _Table de marbre_ of Paris issued instructions which were\r\nto serve in all forests.\r\n\r\nA futile attempt to secure statistical knowledge of the forest domain\r\nwas made, apparently with a view to regulation of the cut, by de Fleury,\r\nthe chief of the forest service in 1561. In default of data from many of\r\nthe _maîtrises_, a provisional partial order to regulate the cut was\r\nissued in 1573, which remained in force for a hundred years, and was\r\nregularly disregarded, extraordinary cuts being made without authority\r\nand with the connivance of the officers.\r\n\r\nAn ordinance of 1579 describes the deplorable condition of the forests\r\nat length, and calls for statistical data, but again without result. A\r\nnumber of further ordinances also made no impression upon the callous\r\nand corrupt officials of the forest service.\r\n\r\nA first class attempt to secure more conservative forest use and to\r\nregulate the cut was made by Henry IV in instituting a commission, and,\r\nas a result of its report, issuing his general order of Rouen, in 1597,\r\na highly interesting document giving insight into conditions and\r\nopinions of the foresters of that period. It also remained without any\r\nresult whatsoever.\r\n\r\nRepeated replacement of the higher officials had no more effect than the\r\nissuance of ordinances.\r\n\r\nNot until Colbert’s vigorous reform in 1669 came a change in conditions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, some forestry notions had been developed: a sequence of\r\nfelling areas in the coppice, and hence an area division, an idea of\r\nrotation and of the exploitable age (10 to 20 years, although sometimes\r\ndown to 3 and 4 years), the leaving of overwood, which became obligatory\r\nin the royal domain, and a kind of regulation of its age (40 years--too\r\nshort according to one writer of the time to furnish valuable trees),\r\nand some proper considerations of its selection.\r\n\r\nIn the timber forest, the fellings proceeded by area in regular order\r\nfrom year to year, leaving a prescribed number of marked seed trees, at\r\nleast 6 to 8 per acre, on such areas as were outside the rights of user\r\nand removed from the likelihood of depredations; the felling age being\r\nat least 100 years, under the notion that the oak, the most favored\r\nspecies, “grows for one hundred years, keeps vigorous but stands still\r\nfor another hundred, and declines in a third hundred.” Sowing of acorns\r\non prepared ground was also ordered in the 16th century, and perhaps\r\noccasionally done. Young growths were sometimes protected by ditches or\r\nfences against cattle, although objections were raised against the\r\nformer as impeding the chase. A diameter limit sometimes reserved all\r\noak and beech two feet in circumference at six inches from the ground,\r\nthe height of the stump. Even improvement cuttings (called _recépages_)\r\nare on record in Normandie, mainly for the purpose of cutting out\r\nsoftwoods and freeing the young valuable reproduction, repeated in\r\ndecennial returns. Later, thinnings assumed the character of selection\r\nfellings and, indeed, received the name of _jardinage_. They were\r\ncontinued until the time for final cut and regeneration had arrived. In\r\nthe coniferous mountain forests, selection cutting, pure and simple, was\r\nthe rule.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that quite sane notions of silviculture existed,\r\nalbeit they may not have been very generally and very strictly carried\r\nout. Especially during the 16th century, the maladministration of the\r\nroyal domain brought with it a decadence of the practice in the woods;\r\nthe area of the coppice increased by clear cutting at the expense of the\r\ntimber forest, and, by Colbert’s time, all forestry knowledge had\r\nwellnigh become forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe forest ordinance of 1669 attempted to reform not only the\r\nadministrative abuses but to improve the method of exploitation hitherto\r\npractised; at least it put in writing, codified as it were, the best\r\nusage of the time. A commission of 21 was instituted to make working\r\nplans and prescribe the practice.\r\n\r\nThe prescriptions had reference both to management and silvicultural\r\npractice. A felling budget (_état d’assiette_) was prescribed annually\r\nby the _grand maître_ for each _garderie_ (district), and felling areas\r\nwere also, sometimes, but not always, definitely located. Besides,\r\nextraordinary fellings might be ordered.\r\n\r\nThe _garderies_ were divided into _triages_ (now called _cantons_),\r\nmanagement classes or site classes under different rotations, and the\r\nfellings proceeded in each _triage_ in sequence.\r\n\r\nIn each felling area, as had supposedly been the practice, at least 8\r\nseed trees per acre, and generally 16, besides those under the diameter\r\nlimit, were to be left--the method _à tire et aire_.\r\n\r\nIntermediary fellings--thinnings--were avoided and frowned down upon,\r\nprobably because of the abuses to which they had given rise. Meanwhile\r\ntheir need grew more and more, especially in those places where the\r\nfelling method did not produce satisfactory regeneration, and softwoods\r\nimpeded the development of the better kinds. To improve the chances for\r\nvaluable regeneration and to keep the softwoods down, the foresters\r\nproposed the reduction of rotations from 100 to 50 and even 40 years,\r\nand, as with each felling the number of reserve trees had to be left,\r\nthe forest assumed a form resembling the coppice under standards.\r\n\r\nIn the coniferous woods of the mountains (fir), which in Colbert’s time\r\nappear almost like a new discovery to his reformers, the selection\r\nforest with a diameter limit (e.g., 6 inch at the small end of the\r\n21-foot log) was the method most generally in vogue, and is still to a\r\nlarge extent the method in use, but somewhat better regulated and\r\nmodified, sometimes with improvement fellings added. In some parts,\r\nespecially in Lorraine, for a time, artificial regeneration and a strip\r\nsystem were tried, and even a group selection with a regeneration period\r\nof probably 25 to 30 years and an exploitable age of 100 years, was\r\npractised in the 18th century.\r\n\r\nBuffon, in 1739, proposed a treatment for the pineries to secure natural\r\nregeneration by cutting one-third to one-half, leaving 40 to 50 seed\r\ntrees per acre, while Duhamel (1780) considers selection method best for\r\nlarch and pine as well as fir, although pine might, like oak, be readily\r\nreproduced by sowing.\r\n\r\nWhile system and orderly progress of fellings in selection forest had\r\ngradually been established, during the revolution this was largely\r\ndisregarded and unconservative fellings became the order.\r\n\r\n_Guiot’s Manuel forestier_, published in 1770, gives a good idea of the\r\nstatus of forestry at that time. It appears that for timber forest,\r\nmostly royal woods, rotations varying from 60 to 200 years, for coppice\r\nfrom 10 to 20 years, were in use on the royal domain; that fellings were\r\nregulated according to species, soil quality and the most advantageous\r\nyield. To facilitate regeneration, a superficial culture of the soil is\r\nalso advocated.\r\n\r\nThe prescription of Colbert’s ordinance to leave a certain number of\r\nseed trees, no matter for what species or conditions of soil or climate\r\nhad as early as 1520 been pointed out as faulty by one of the grand\r\nmasters, _Tristan de Rostaing_, who had recommended a method of\r\nsuccessive fellings. This prescription, applied pretty nearly uniformly\r\nas a matter of law, removed from the officials all spirit of initiative\r\nand desire or requirement of improving upon it. No knowledge beyond that\r\nof the law was required of them, hence no development of silvicultural\r\nmethods resulted during the 17th and 18th century. The seed trees left\r\non the felling areas grew into undesirable and branchy “wolves,”\r\ninjuring the aftergrowth, or else were thrown by the wind or died, and\r\nmany of the areas became undesirable brush. Not until the first quarter\r\nof the 19th century was a change in this method proposed through men who\r\nimported new ideas from Germany.\r\n\r\nWhen the inefficiency of the _méthode à tire et aire_ was recognized,\r\nthe only remedy appeared to lie in a clearing system with artificial\r\nreforestation (recommended by _Réaumur_ and _Duhamel_); and, indeed, the\r\nordinance of 1669 recognized the probable necessity of filling up fail\r\nplaces in that manner. Yet the success of the plantings in waste lands\r\ndoes not seem to have brought about much extension of this method to the\r\nfelling areas. As late as 1862, Clavé, complaining of the conditions of\r\nsilviculture in France, and of the ignorance regarding it, refers to the\r\nclearing system as _méthode allemande_, the German method. The\r\nshelterwood system, _la méthode du réensemencement_, which was\r\nintroduced in theory from Germany by Lorentz in 1827, was hardly applied\r\nuntil the middle of the century. Indeed, the promulgation of this\r\nsuperior method cost Lorentz his position in 1839, and other officers\r\nsuffered similarly for this “German propaganda.” (see p. 242)[7]\r\n\r\n  [7] In this statement we follow Clavé and other authors. Huffel\r\n  takes exception to this conception of the origin of the shelterwood\r\n  system, because he finds in some documents allusion to a modified\r\n  application of the _tire et aire_ method which might be construed\r\n  into shelterwood regeneration. Indeed, Guiot (1770) and Varennes de\r\n  Fenille (1790) describe methods of procedure which resemble somewhat\r\n  this method of regeneration. But as the method of successive\r\n  fellings was practised in Germany since 1720, and fully developed in\r\n  all its detail by 1790--Hartig formulating merely into rules what\r\n  was long practised--it is likely that the French authors had heard\r\n  of it. Moreover, in another place (vol. III, p. 271) Huffel says:\r\n  “At this time (1821) one made several tentative regeneration\r\n  cuttings by successive fellings according to the new formula--but\r\n  without success.”\r\n\r\nAt the present time large areas of coppice and of coppice with standards\r\ncharacterize the holdings of the municipal and private owners, and the\r\nselection forest still plays a considerable part even in the State\r\nforests; the method of shelterwood in compartments, being still more\r\nunder discussion than found in practice.\r\n\r\nThe main credit for advance in silvicultural direction which belongs to\r\nthe French foresters in particular is the development of new and fertile\r\nideas regarding the operations of thinnings; here the differentiation of\r\nthe crop into the final harvest (_le haut_) and the nurse crop (_le\r\nbas_) (see page 105) and the differentiation of the operations, _par le\r\nhaut_ and _par le bas_, seems to have been for the first time described\r\nby Boppe in 1887. Indeed, the theory of thinnings, at least, seems to\r\nhave been well understood by Buffon, who advanced his theories in a\r\nmemoir to the Academy of France, in 1774, and gives a very clear\r\nexposition of the value of thinnings and improvement cuttings.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, thinning practice, while often accentuated in the\r\nliterature, is too often omitted in practice, or exercised only in long\r\nintervals, while otherwise silvicultural practice is excellent,\r\nespecially in the coppice. Most valuable lessons may be had especially\r\nfrom the experience in converting coppice into timber forest.\r\n\r\nAt the International Congress of Silviculture, convening in connection\r\nwith the Universal Exposition in 1900, supposedly the best home talent\r\nwas represented, but it cannot be said that anything new, or striking,\r\nor promotive of the art or science transpired. The desirability of\r\nestablishing experiment stations outside the one in existence at Nancy\r\n(established in 1882), and the desirability of constructing yield tables\r\nstill required arguments at this meeting.\r\n\r\nIn the direction of forest organization, it is stated by Clavé that in\r\n1860 only 900,000 acres of the State domain were under a regulated\r\nmanagement, namely 380,000 acres in timber forest and 520,000 in coppice\r\nwith standards, leaving about 1,500,000 acres at that time still merely\r\nexploited. The same writer states that of the corporation or communal\r\nforests hardly any are under management for sustained yield, and private\r\nforest management is not mentioned in this connection. Even to-day less\r\nthan one-third of the total area is under systematic control. In 1908\r\nstill, about 14% of the State forests were without working plans, and\r\n15% in selection forest.\r\n\r\nThe method of forest organization employed, outside of the crude\r\ndeterminations of a felling budget in the selection forest, is an\r\nimitation of Cotta’s combined area and volume allotment, with hardly any\r\nattempt of securing normality, introduced in 1825. Characteristic, and\r\ndiffering from the German model, is the practice of actually\r\ncollocating in each district (_canton_) the periodic felling areas\r\n(_affectations_) on the ground so as to secure a schematic felling\r\nseries or periodic block (_séries_). This is done often at great\r\nsacrifice. Lately, various, more pliable modifications have come into\r\nvogue (_méthode de l’affectation unique_) and freer methods (_méthode du\r\nquartier de régénération_), somewhat similar to Judeich’s stand\r\nmanagement, are proposed. Altogether working plans, such as are\r\nelaborated in Germany, are rare, and yield tables are still looked upon\r\nby Huffel as doubtfully useful.\r\n\r\nThe management of the State forests is extremely conservative, large\r\naccumulations of old stock, the holding over of one quarter for reserve,\r\nand high rotations--only apparently based on maximum volume production,\r\nsince the statistical data are scanty--are characteristic. The opposite\r\nconditions appear in the private forests.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Education and Literature._\r\n\r\nIn the earlier times the service established was as we have seen, often,\r\nnay mostly in incompetent hands; the offices of forestmasters were\r\npurchasable, were given to courtiers as benefices, and became\r\nhereditary. In all these, higher professional knowledge was unnecessary.\r\nThe ignorance of the subordinates was as great as that of their German\r\ncounterparts, but lasted longer. Hardly any book literature on the\r\nsubject of forestry developed before the 19th century, and educational\r\ninstitutions had to wait until long past the beginning of that century.\r\n\r\nThe first, and up to the present, only forest school, came into\r\nexistence after a considerable campaign, directed by Baudrillart, Chief\r\nof Division, Administration Générale des Forêts, and professor of\r\npolitical economy. His campaign in the _Annales Forestières_, the first\r\nvolume of which appeared in 1808, and in other writings as in his\r\n_Dictionnaire des eaux et forêts_ (1825), led to the establishment of\r\nthe forest school at Nancy in 1825.\r\n\r\nThe first director of this school, _Bernard Lorentz_, having become\r\nacquainted with and befriended by G. L. Hartig, and his assistant,\r\nafterward his son-in-law and successor, _Adolphe Parade_, having studied\r\nunder Cotta (1817-1818) in Tharandt, this school introduced the science\r\nof forestry as it had then been developed in Germany; but later\r\ngenerations under _Nanquette_, _Bagneris_, _Broillard_, _Boppe_ and\r\n_Puton_, imbued with patriotism, attempted in a manner to strike out on\r\noriginal lines.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the “unpatriotic” German tendencies of its first\r\ndirectors the continuance of the school at Nancy was several times\r\nthreatened, there being friction between the administration of the\r\nschool and the service, which in 1844 came to a climax, agents in the\r\nservice being employed without preparation in the school, a condition\r\nwhich lasted until 1856.\r\n\r\nEven to date an active service of 15 years is considered equivalent to\r\nthe education in the school for advancement in the service.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, Lorentz was disgracefully displaced, in spite of his great\r\nmerits, because he advocated too warmly the application of the superior\r\nsystem of regeneration under shelterwood to replace the coppice and\r\nselection forest, an incident almost precisely repeated in the State of\r\nNew York in abandoning its State College at Cornell University; and in\r\nother respects the two cases appear parallel.[8] Parade, the successor\r\nof Lorentz being imbued with the same heretical doctrines was constantly\r\nin trouble, and in 1847, a most savage attack in the legislature was\r\nlaunched which threatened the collapse of the school. This condition\r\nlasted until Parade’s death, in 1864, when _Nanquette_ assumed guidance\r\nof the school and steered in more peaceful waters by avoiding all ideas\r\nat reforms and innovations, but otherwise improving the character of the\r\nschool and introducing the third year study. But he, too, was much\r\ncriticized and in difficulties until 1880; nor was _Puton_, his\r\nsuccessor, free from troubles, until in 1889 a new regime and new\r\nregulations were enacted.\r\n\r\n  [8] According to others (a reviewer of this volume), the\r\n  difficulties which befell the institution were financial ones, “the\r\n  too rapid conversion into timberforest reducing receipts, which the\r\n  Minister of Finance resented.” Guyot’s history of the school,\r\n  however, leaves little doubt of the above interpretation being\r\n  correct. In the case of the State College at Cornell University, a\r\n  later historian might similarly claim financial difficulties, the\r\n  school having actually been closed for lack of appropriation;\r\n  nevertheless political trickery was the real cause of this lack.\r\n\r\nThe school is organized on military lines. The students, who intend to\r\nenter the State service are chosen from the graduates of the Institute\r\nnational agronomique of Paris, only a limited number being admitted. It\r\nhas 12 professors, two for forestry, two each for natural science,\r\nmathematics, and one each for law, soil physics and agriculture, for\r\nmilitary science and for German. A three year course, which includes\r\njourneys through the forest regions of France, leads to government\r\nemployment; indeed, the first paid position as _garde général stagiaire_\r\nis attained after two years study and before leaving school.\r\n\r\nFor several years, (1867 to 1884) English students preparing for the\r\nIndian service received their instruction here, and 380 foreigners have\r\nreceived their education in this school since its foundation.\r\n\r\nFor the education of the lower grades, an imperial rescript ordered the\r\nestablishment of several schools, which were, however, never organized.\r\nIn 1863, were proposed, and in 1868, opened, four schools, where\r\nefficient forest guards were to secure some knowledge that would assist\r\nthem to advancement; three of these schools persisted until 1883. In\r\n1873, an additional school for silviculture for the education of\r\nunderforesters was organized at Barres-Vilmorin, where annually a\r\nlimited number of students are permitted to enter. This institution has\r\npersisted to date.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe French _forestry literature_ has never been prolific, and to this\r\nday occupies still a limited amount of shelf room. The first book on\r\nrecord is a translation of the well known volume of the Italian, Peter\r\nde Crescentiis, translated at the instance of Charles V in 1373. In the\r\n16th century we have reference to an encyclopædic volume, probably\r\nsimilar to the German Hausväter, by _Oliver de Serres_, _Théatre\r\nd’Agriculture et Mesnage des Champs_, in which a chapter is devoted to\r\nthe forests. During the 18th century, just as in Germany the\r\ncameralists, we have in France a number of high class writings, not by\r\nforesters, but by savants or students of natural history, the names of\r\nRéaumur, Duhamel, Buffon and Micheaux appearing with memoirs transmitted\r\nto the Academy of France, the highest literary and scientific body of\r\nmen, on subjects relating to forestry. _Réaumur_, in his _Réflexions sur\r\nl’état des forêts_, in 1721, recommended the conversion of coppice\r\nforests into timber forests by a system of thinnings, but it is evident\r\nthat his words were not heard beyond the Academy. _Duhamel_ (in 1755,\r\n1764, 1780) repeats the recommendation of Réaumur in his three memoirs,\r\n_Semis et Plantations_, _Exploitation des Bois_ and _Traité de la\r\nPhysique des Arbres_, in which he exhibits considerable learning, while\r\n_Buffon_, the great naturalist, in 1739 and after, presented several\r\nmemoirs on forestry subjects full of excellent advice. _Varennes de\r\nFenille_, another one of the Academicians, but also one of the\r\nconservators is on record with two memoirs (1790, 1791) on the\r\nmanagement of coppice and timber forests in which also the theory of\r\nthinnings was well developed. But among the foresters of the service\r\nthere seems not to have been sufficient education to appreciate these\r\nwritings, or, with the exception of _Guiot_ with his _Manuel forestier_\r\n(1770), to bring forth any contributions to the literature and art,\r\nuntil the 19th century. In 1803, we find the first encyclopædic volume\r\nin _Traité de l’Aménagement des Forêts_, which was followed, in 1805, by\r\na very incorrect translation of Hartig’s _Lehrbuch_, both by\r\nBaudrillart, professor of political economy, who also published in 12\r\nvolumes his _Traité Général des Eaux et Forêts_. _Perthuis_, in 1796,\r\nand _Dralet_, a forester, in 1807, also brought out treatises on forest\r\nmanagement, which include all branches of the subject.\r\n\r\nAccording to Huffel, the foresters of this period (Louis XV and XVI)\r\nwere of superior character, and forestry in France the first in the\r\nworld; the writings of French authors were being translated into German\r\nand studied by foreign foresters. He has to admit, however, that the\r\nmajority of these authors were not really members of the forest service.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 appeared _Parade’s_ _Cours Elémentaire de Culture des Bois_, an\r\nexcellent book, recording the teachings of Hartig and Cotta. This seems\r\nto have been all-sufficient until 1873, at least. Such things as yield\r\ntables are still a mere wish, when _Tassy_ wrote his _Etudes, etc._, in\r\n1858, while _de Salomon_ a little later reproduced Cotta’s yield tables,\r\nand to this day this needful tool of the forester is still almost\r\nabsent, at least in the literature of France. _Nanquette_, _Broillard_,\r\n_Bagneris_, _Puton_, _Reuss_, _Boppe_, all directors or professors at\r\nthe forest school, enriched the French literature by volumes on\r\nsilviculture and forest management, and _Henry_ on soil physics. He also\r\ntranslated from the German Wollny’s _Décomposition des matières\r\norganiques_. It is claimed by _Guyot_, that a truly “French science” (!)\r\nof forestry dates from _Broillard’s Cours d’aménagement_ in 1878.\r\n_Demontzey’s Reboisement des montagnes_, 1882, is a classic volume. Of\r\nmore modern book literature may be mentioned three voluminous\r\npublications, namely _Traité des arbres_ by _Mouillefert_ (1892-1898) in\r\n3 volumes, and _Traité d’exploitation commerciale des bois_ by _Matthey_\r\nin two volumes, and _Guyot’s_ _Cours de droit forestier_ in two\r\nvolumes. A very complete work on valuation of damage under the\r\nmisleading title _Incendies en forêt_ was published by _Jacquot_ in\r\n1903.\r\n\r\nBut the latest and perhaps most ambitious work in the French language\r\nand especially of intense interest from the historical point of view,\r\ntracing not only the development of forest policies but of silvicultural\r\nand managerial practices in France, is _G. Huffel’s_ _Economie\r\nForestière_ in three volumes published 1904-1907.\r\n\r\nThere should not be forgotten as among the non-professional promoters of\r\nforest questions, _Chevandier_, a chemist and manufacturer, who, in\r\n1844, made investigations regarding the influence of irrigation on wood\r\ngrowth and on the influence of fertilizers, and in connection with\r\n_Wertheim_, laid the foundation for timber physics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne bi-weekly magazine, _Revue des Eaux et Forêts_, in existence for 50\r\nyears, the successor to the _Annales forestières_, begun in 1808,\r\nsatisfies the needs of current literature, besides the journals of\r\nvarious forestry associations, among which the Bulletin de la Société de\r\nFranche Comté et Belfort has for a long time taken a prominent rank.\r\n\r\nA very active propagandist literary and association work has within the\r\nlast decades been inaugurated, and forestry associations of local\r\ncharacter abound. Among these the “Touring Club,” a sporting association\r\nwith some 16,000 members in 364 branches is active by writing out prizes\r\nand promoting waste land planting. Through its agency some 4000 acres\r\nhad been planted by 1910, some 900 nurseries furnishing plant material.\r\n\r\nAn active Section of Silviculture in the _Société des Agriculteurs_ some\r\ntime ago absorbed the forestry association and is also doing practical\r\nwork in the direction most needed, improvement of forestry practice\r\namong private woodland owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Colonial Policies._\r\n\r\nThe French possess extensive colonies in Africa, Asia, America and\r\nOceania, covering not less than four million square miles with over 90\r\nmillion people, to some of which at least they have extended some\r\nfeatures of their forest policy, notably in Algeria, Tunis, Indo-China\r\nand Madagascar.\r\n\r\n_Algeria_, which was conquered in 1828, is about four-fifths of the size\r\nof France, but only 5.5 per cent. is forested. Besides the desert, there\r\nare two forest regions, the northern slope, the so-called Tell, abutting\r\non the Mediterranean, which, with 20 per cent. forested, contains the\r\nmost valuable forests of Cork Oak, various other oaks, and Aleppo Pine;\r\nand the high plateau to the south, a region of steppes with about 6%\r\nforested, mostly with brushwood. The adjoining _Tunis_ also contains\r\nsome 2 million acres of forest, a part of which clothed with the\r\nvaluable Cork Oak.\r\n\r\nAlthough the population does not exceed 5 million, import of wood from\r\nSweden and elsewhere to nearly one million dollars in amount is\r\nnecessary. The first advance of civilization led to wide-spread\r\ndestruction of the originally larger forest area; fire and pasture\r\nbeing specially destructive.\r\n\r\nBefore the French occupation, the 8 million acres of forest were all, as\r\nusual in the mussulman’s empires, the property of the sultan, but were\r\nused like communal property by the people. By 1871, the larger portion,\r\nsome 6 million acres remained in possession of the state, much\r\nencumbered by rights of user.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, considerable areas (some 700,000 acres) had been ceded\r\nto communities outright, and others (1.25 million acres) had been sold\r\nto private parties. At first, these latter lands were let for\r\nexploitation of the cork oak on 40 year leases, later extended to 90\r\nyears with indemnities for damage by fire--an incentive to allow these\r\nto run, until in 1870, the fire damage having become onerous, all areas\r\nburned after 1863 were gratuitously ceded to the contractors, more than\r\none-third the areas involved, and the other two-thirds were then sold at\r\na ridiculously low price and under the easiest conditions of payment, in\r\nthe same shameful manner in which the timberlands of the United States\r\nwere given away.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, a forest administration for the state domain was inaugurated,\r\nbut the unfortunate division of powers between military and civil\r\nauthorities was a hindrance to effective improvement of conditions. The\r\nfire ravages of 1871 led to a thorough re-organization under the\r\ndirection of Tassy, in 1873.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in 1900, Lefebvre, Inspector of Forests, in his book, _Les\r\nforêts de l’Algérie_, still complains that the forests are being ruined,\r\nespecially by pasturing, the means allowed the administration being too\r\nniggardly measured.\r\n\r\nThe Forest Code of the home country and special laws enacted from time\r\nto time applies. The administration of the state and communal forest is\r\ndirectly under the home department and is regulated in similar manner.\r\n\r\nA re-organization and a special forest code for Algiers was enacted in\r\n1903. This legislation relies still largely on the general principles of\r\nthe Code of 1827. The most interesting features are the provision for\r\nexpropriation and addition to the state domain of forests the\r\npreservation of which is of public interest, and the rigorous forest\r\nfire legislation, which permits the treatment of incendiaries as\r\ninsurrectionists, makes the extinction of forest fires a duty of the\r\nforest officials, and provides the forcible establishment of fire lines\r\n(rides) between neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn the forests placed under the forestry regime, permits from the\r\ngovernor-general are required for clearing. For the administration of\r\nthese properties, the state receives ten per cent. of the gross yield.\r\nReforested hilltops or slopes and sand dunes are relieved from taxes for\r\n30 years, burnt areas for 10 years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the other African possessions, unregulated exploitation of the\r\ntropical forests, largely for by-products, like caoutchouc, kola, and\r\nfine furniture woods, is still the order of the day, except in\r\n_Madagascar_, which with 25 to 30 million acres of tropical forest area,\r\nwas, in 1900, provided with a forest service, which is under the\r\nMinister of Colonies. Here, a license system is in vogue, giving\r\nconcessions to exploit limited areas for a given time, at an annual rent\r\nof less than one cent, per acre per year. The concessions run from 5 to\r\n20 years, and on 12,500 acres or more, the time of their duration being\r\nextended from the lowest term for one year for every 2,500 acres. Police\r\nregulations and fines are intended to check abuses, and to regulate the\r\nrights of user exercised by natives.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn _Indo-China_ (Cochin-China, Cambodia, Anam, Tonquin) the total forest\r\narea is still unknown. Only that of Cochin-China with 2.5 million acres,\r\nand of Cambodia with 10 million acres can be stated, and Cochin-China\r\nseems to possess the only approach to a forest service. Although it is\r\nestimated that in 1901 in the whole of Indo-China, with 18 million\r\npeople, some 85 million cubic feet of wood were cut (nine-tenths fire\r\nwood) an import of over $200,000 worth of workwood from Europe was\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts at regulating forest use in these Asiatic possessions\r\ndate back to 1862, when exploitation was confined to delimited areas.\r\nThe administration, however, remained inefficient, and under\r\nimpracticable and heterogeneous orders, which were issued from time to\r\ntime, devastation progressed with little hindrance.\r\n\r\nFor Cochin-China, a more definite forest policy was formulated in\r\n1894-5, when not only the State domain but also the private forest\r\nproperty was placed under the _régime forestier_. The supervision of the\r\nprivate forests consists in requiring the marking of trees to be cut by\r\ngovernment agents, and a permit for their removal.\r\n\r\nThe State forests are of two classes: Reserves in which all cutting is\r\nforbidden, only some 200,000 acres; and those in which licenses to cut\r\nmay operate. Such licenses are given for one year and for a price of 100\r\npiastres. The villagers have free use of the less valuable woods, their\r\nonly obligation being to assist in protection against fire and theft.\r\n\r\nA real forest service was not instituted until 1901 a director with four\r\nassistants being placed in charge under the Department of Agriculture.\r\nUntil recently reports of the deplorable condition due to absence of\r\ntechnical management reached the outside, but lately (1911), the\r\nGovernor-General discussing the situation not only speaks approvingly of\r\nthe forest service, which on the two million acres under its immediate\r\nmanagement had, by 1909, trebled the revenue, but talks of extending its\r\nactivities to planting up waste places in order to secure favorable\r\nwater conditions for irrigating lands.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the colonies are being merely exploited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA AND FINLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Les Forêts de la Russie, Ministère de l’Agriculture, Paris\r\n  Exposition Universelle_, 1900, pp. 190, gives a very detailed\r\n  description of forest conditions, markets and management, with a few\r\n  historic points.\r\n\r\n  _Russlands Wald_, by F. V. ARNOLD, Berlin, 1893, pp. 526, contains\r\n  historic notes and a profuse discussion of the law of 1888.\r\n\r\n  _The Industries of Russia: Agriculture and Forestry_, issued by the\r\n  Department of Agriculture, Ministry of Crown Lands, at World’s\r\n  Columbian Exposition, translated by J. M. CRAWFORD, 1893, contains a\r\n  chapter on Forestry by ROUDZSKI and SHAFRANOV, professors at the\r\n  Forest Institute, in 35 pp.\r\n\r\n  Annual reports by the Russian Forest Administration are published\r\n  since 1866.\r\n\r\n  Four diffuse volumes, by JOHN CROUMBIE BROWN, treat of Russian\r\n  conditions, namely,\r\n\r\n  _Forests and Forestry in Poland, Lithuania_, etc., 1885;\r\n  _Finland, its Forests and Forest Management_, 1883;\r\n  _Forestry and Mining districts of the Ural Mountains_, 1884;\r\n  _Forests and Forestry of Northern Russia_, 1884.\r\n\r\n  Numerous articles and Reviews by O. GUSE, scattered through the\r\n  German forestry journals, give insight into Russian forest\r\n  conditions.\r\n\r\n  An excellent idea of prevailing forestry practice can be gained from\r\n  an extended article by DR. SCHWAPPACH, _Forstliche Reisebilder aus\r\n  Russland_ in Zeitschrift für Forst- und Jagdwesen, 1902.\r\n\r\n  For Finland an article by B. ERICSON in Forstwissenschaftliches\r\n  Centralblatt, 1896, and another article by P. W. HANNIKAINEN in\r\n  Allgemeine Forst- und Jagdzeitung, 1892, both native foresters, give\r\n  considerable information.\r\n\r\n  _Finland: Its Public and Private Economy_, by N. C. FREDERIKSEN,\r\n  1902, 306 pp.\r\n\r\nWhile Germany and France were forced into the adoption of forest\r\npolicies through necessity, after the natural woods had been largely\r\ndestroyed or devastated, Russia started upon a conservative forest\r\nmanagement, long before the day of absolute necessity seemed to have\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nIndeed, even to-day Russia is one of the largest and increasingly\r\ngrowing exporter of forest products in the world, its annual export\r\nhaving grown in the five years, 1903 to 1908, from 4 to 6 million tons\r\nand from 35 to 62 million dollars. A vast territory of untouched woods\r\nis still at her command, representing roughly two-thirds of the forest\r\narea of Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe vast empire, second only to the British empire in extent, gradually\r\nacquired since the 15th century, occupies in Europe (including Finland)\r\nsomewhat over 2 million square miles with over 120 million inhabitants,\r\nand in Asia somewhat over 6.5 million square miles, with only 30 to 40\r\nmillion people.\r\n\r\nUntil 1906, when as a result of a revolution, a kind of representative\r\ngovernment was secured, the hereditary Czar was ostensibly and by title\r\nan autocrat, governing with the assistance of four great councils and 12\r\nministers, but in reality the government was in the hands of a\r\nbureaucracy and court cabal, to a large extent corrupt, and hence the\r\nmany good laws and institutions of which we read, may not always be\r\nfound executed in practice as intended.\r\n\r\nThe European section of the country is divided into 98 governments or\r\nprovinces, each under a governor, who is, however, largely dependent on\r\nthe central power. The large territory of Siberia is divided into three\r\ngovernor-generalships, much of it, as well as of the other Asiatic\r\nprovinces, is still unorganized, undeveloped and unexplored, or at least\r\nlittle known. Originally used mainly as a penal colony for criminal and\r\npolitical exiles, since the completion of the great Trans-Siberian\r\nrailway, the country has been peopled by Russian farmers.\r\n\r\nBoth European Russia and Siberia are in the main vast plains, the\r\nformer sloping northwestward from the Ural mountains in the East and\r\nfrom the Caucasus in the South, and the latter from the Altai, Lyan and\r\nYabloni mountains north to the Arctic Ocean. Both sections exhibit in\r\nthe southern ranges the effect of continental climates, prairie and\r\nplains country: the steppe; and in its northern ranges the effect of an\r\narctic climate, short hot summers and long, severe winters: tundra and\r\nswamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Forest Conditions and Ownership._\r\n\r\nBoth the forest area and the ownership conditions vary very much\r\nthroughout the empire. Russian statistics are very unreliable and are\r\nbased on estimates rather than enumerations, and vary from year to year.\r\n\r\nSo little is known of conditions in Asia, where Russia occupies a\r\nterritory three times as large as its European possessions, that we can\r\ndispose of them briefly. There exists a vast forested area, almost\r\nunknown as to its extent and contents, or value. This area is mainly\r\nlocated in Siberia, and although its extent is uncertain, it is known to\r\nexceed 700 million acres, but it is also known that its character is\r\nvery variable, and much of it is “taiga” or swamp forest, much of it\r\ndevastated, and much of it in precarious condition, fires having run and\r\nstill running over large portions, destroying it to such an extent that\r\nin several of the provinces within the forest belt, the question of wood\r\nsupplies is even now a troublesome one. The natives are especially\r\nreckless, and devastation difficult to control. The railroad has only\r\nincreased the evils.\r\n\r\nHere, in Siberia, the first attempt at a management was made in 1897 in\r\nthe government forests, which are estimated at over 300 million acres;\r\nin addition about 400 million acres have been declared reserved forests.\r\nNot one-third, however, even of the government forests is well stocked\r\nand less than 4 million acres are under some form of management.\r\n\r\nIn European Russia, the forest area comprises about 465 million acres,\r\nor 36% of the land area. The population being now over 120 million\r\n(nearly one-half escaped from serfdom only since 1861), the forest area\r\nper capita is only about 4 acres, somewhat less than in the United\r\nStates, half of what is claimed for Sweden and Norway, although seven\r\ntimes as large as that of Germany or France.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that Russia, although still an exporting\r\ncountry, has reasons for a conservative policy, even if only the needs\r\nof the domestic population are considered, which alone probably consumes\r\nmore than the annual increment of the whole forest area; and the\r\nconsumption is growing with the growth of civilization as appears from\r\nthe increase of wood consuming industries, which in 1877 showed a\r\nproduct of 8 million dollars, in 1887, of 12½ million, in 1897, of 50\r\nmillion dollars.\r\n\r\nThis assertion, that the era of over-cutting has actually arrived, may\r\nbe made in spite of the stated fact, that in the northern provinces only\r\ntwo-fifths of what is supposed to be a proper felling budget, is cut and\r\nmarketed, and that other most uncertain estimates make the cut 17 cubic\r\nfeet per acre of productive forest area, and the annual growth, on\r\nstill more uncertain basis, 31 cubic feet.[9] The same reasons that\r\noperate in the United States contribute to wasteful practices, namely\r\nuneven distribution of forest and population.\r\n\r\n  [9] An idea of the supposed productive conditions may be gathered\r\n  from the estimates which have been made, in 1898, for the State\r\n  forests and the operations in these.\r\n\r\n  In the two northern provinces, in which the state owns nearly the\r\n  entire forest area it is estimated that 8 cubic feet per acre would\r\n  be available felling budget, but only 10 per cent. of this is\r\n  actually cut and sold. Outside of this territory the available\r\n  felling budget is calculated at 24 cubic feet per acre, but only 60\r\n  per cent. or 14 cubic feet is being cut. Altogether in 1898 there\r\n  were cut in the State forests (somewhat over 300 million acres),\r\n  1,860 million cubic feet, say 6 cubic feet per acre or 40 per cent.\r\n  of the estimated proper felling budget. The administration claims\r\n  that three-fifth of the projected felling budget is saleable. In\r\n  1906, the budget was placed at 345 million cubic feet, but only 130\r\n  million were cut.\r\n\r\n  An estimate of the cut in the communal forests with 12 cubic feet,\r\n  in the peasants holdings with 20 cubic feet, and in the private\r\n  forests with 40 cubic feet per acre, brings the total for the\r\n  country to round 10 billion cubic feet, worth round 100 million\r\n  dollars for stumpage. It is assumed that 30 cubic feet should be the\r\n  annual increment per acre, when it would appear that only 70 per\r\n  cent. of the increment is cut.\r\n\r\n  The cut in the State forests was sold for 21 million dollars (1898),\r\n  or at an average of less than 1c. per cubic foot. The highest price\r\n  paid in the Vistula district was 2.5 cents, which scales down to 1c.\r\n  in Siberia and to one-third cent. in the Caucasus. This refers to\r\n  stumpage, nearly all sales being made on the stump to wood merchants\r\n  by bids, the trees being marked in some parts, in others the area\r\n  only being designated. The transportation is almost entirely by\r\n  river. From 1883 to 1901 the net revenue from the State forests\r\n  increased from 16 to 47 million dollars, while the expenditures\r\n  dropped from 29 per cent. of the gross revenue to 18.4 per cent. The\r\n  gross result is 46 cents per acre. In 1906, the returns were $27\r\n  million, and expenses $5 million.\r\n\r\nAs in the United States the East and West are or were well wooded, with\r\na forestless agricultural region between, so in Russia the North and the\r\nSouth (Caucasus Mountains) are well wooded, with a forestless region,\r\nthe steppe, between. This leads, as with us, to an uneconomical\r\nexploitation of the woods, the inferior materials being wasted because\r\nnot paying for their transportation in one section, and dearth of timber\r\nand fuelwood in the other section.\r\n\r\nThe two most northern provinces of Archangel and Vologda, in size equal\r\nto all Germany, are wooded to the extent of 75 and 89 per cent.\r\nrespectively, and the 14 northern provinces together contain nearly\r\none-half the entire forest area. Here the forest covers 64 per cent. of\r\nthe land area, and nowhere below 20 per cent., and the acreage per\r\ncapita ranges from 3 to over 200.\r\n\r\nThese largely unsettled provinces are the basis of the active wood\r\nexport trade, and, as in the similarly conditioned areas of North\r\nAmerica, the territory is devastated by fires, which sweep again and\r\nagain over large areas without check.\r\n\r\nSouthern Russia (excepting the Caucasus), is largely prairie or steppe,\r\nforest cover sinking below 20 per cent. on the whole, down to 2 per\r\ncent., and less than one-half acre per capita.\r\n\r\nAltogether, one-half the country and three-fourths of the population\r\nare, with less than 14 per cent. of the forest area, exposed to a dearth\r\nof timber.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe northern forest, the most important economic factor, is composed\r\nlargely of pure or mixed coniferous woods (74%), principally Norway\r\nSpruce (34%) and Scotch Pine (29.5%) with only slight admixtures of\r\nlarch and fir, and more frequently White Birch. Open stand,\r\ncomparatively poor development, and slow growth, characteristic of\r\nnorthern climate, reduce its productive capacity, while frequent bogs\r\nand other natural waste places outside of those produced by\r\nmismanagement reduce its productive area by not less than 20 per cent.\r\n\r\nToward the south, deciduous species are more frequent, oak finally\r\nbecoming the prevailing timber and forming forests, with beech, maple,\r\nash and elm as admixtures. As the plains are approached pure deciduous\r\nforest indicates the change of climate. The forest of the Caucasus is\r\nprincipally of coniferous composition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are six classes of forest property: the government domain; the\r\napanage or imperial family (crown) forests; private forests; peasant or\r\ncommunal forests; institute or corporation forests; and forests of mixed\r\nownership in which government and private owners participate.\r\n\r\nThe larger part of the forest area of European Russia is in control of\r\nthe Crown or State, namely, nearly 278 million acres, or a little less\r\nthan two-thirds of the whole, and a similar amount in Asia, besides the\r\nso-called apanage forests of 14 million acres set aside for the support\r\nof the court. Especially the northern forest is in government control,\r\nin some governments (Archangel) the entire area; 67% of the domain\r\nforest lies in the two governments of Archangel and Wologda.\r\n\r\nIn the less wooded districts State property, is insignificant. The area\r\nunder government control in Europe and Asia is estimated in the official\r\nreport for 1908 at around 957 million acres. This is, however, not the\r\nexclusive property of the State; only about 260 million acres are so\r\nclaimed, the larger balance includes 170 million acres which are to be\r\napportioned to the liberated peasants, 200 million acres in which the\r\ngovernment is only part owner, or the ownership is in dispute; and the\r\nrest is only temporarily placed under the management or surveillance of\r\nthe administration. Yet, 60% in Europe and 13% in Asia is exclusive\r\nState property. In 1907, the area in Europe under working plans of the\r\nForest Administration, however, was only 48 million acres, 86 million\r\nhaving been examined for working plans. Of the State property in Europe\r\n34% is spruce forest, 30% pine, and 26% mixed conifer forest; altogether\r\n88% of coniferous timber. The Asiatic area is also over 80 per cent.\r\nconiferous.\r\n\r\nThe apanage or crown forests, the yield of which goes toward maintenance\r\nof the imperial family, comprise about 16 million acres, or 3.4%.\r\nPrivate forest property to the extent of over 100 million acres (23%) is\r\nmost developed in the Baltic provinces and along the Vistula. Mining\r\ncorporations and other institutes own about 7 million acres.\r\n\r\nThe peasants, who until 1861 were mere serfs and had no ownership of any\r\nkind, being supplied with their necessities by the landed proprietors,\r\nstill largely supply themselves in the northern provinces by the\r\nexercise of rights of user from the public domain on designated areas.\r\nIn the central and southern provinces, farm and forest land, the latter\r\nto the extent of nearly 40 million acres, were given to them in communal\r\nownership. As stated above, about 170 million acres classed as\r\ngovernment domain still awaits partition and cession to the peasants.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Development of Forest Policy._\r\n\r\nThe first record of attention to the woods as a special property dates\r\nfrom Michael, the founder, and Alexis, the second of the house of\r\nRomanoff, the former becoming Czar in 1613, the latter in 1645. He it\r\nwas who began to introduce Western civilization. He confined himself,\r\nhowever, to regulating property rights, which up to that time had\r\nremained somewhat undefined, the forest, as elsewhere, being considered\r\nmore or less public property. He issued deeds of ownership, or at least\r\ngranted exclusive rights to the use of forests, somewhat similar as was\r\ndone in the banforests. Soldiers alone were permitted to help\r\nthemselves, even in private forests, to the wood they required.\r\nProtection against theft and fire was also provided.\r\n\r\nThe peasants, being serfs, were bound to the glebe, and had, of course,\r\nno property rights, being maintained by the bounty of the seigneurs.\r\n\r\nAlexis’ successor, the far-seeing Peter the Great, who in his travels in\r\nGermany and other European countries had, no doubt, been imbued with\r\nideas of conservatism, inaugurated in the end of the 17th and beginning\r\nof the 18th century a far-reaching restrictive policy, which had two\r\nobjects in view, namely economic use of wood, which he had learned to\r\nappreciate while playing carpenter in Amsterdam, and preservation of\r\nship timber, which his desire to build up a navy dictated. All forests\r\nfor 35 miles alongside of rivers were declared in ban, and placed under\r\nthe supervision of the newly organized Administration of Crown forests.\r\nIn these banforests, the felling of timbers fit for ship building was\r\nforbidden. Minute regulations as to the proper use of wood for the\r\npurposes for which it was most fit were prescribed, and the use of the\r\nsaw instead of the axe was ordered. These rules were to prevail in all\r\nforests, with a few exceptions, and penalties were to be exacted for\r\ncontraventions.\r\n\r\nThis good beginning experienced a short setback under Catherine I\r\n(1725), Peter’s wife, who, influenced by her minister, Menshikoff,\r\nabolished the forest administration and the penalties, and reduced the\r\nnumber and size of banforests. But the entire legislation was re-enacted\r\nwithin three years after Catherine’s death (1727) under Anna Ivanovna’s\r\nreign, and many new prescriptions for the proper use of wood were added\r\nand additional penalties enforced.\r\n\r\nAt this time, under the influence of a German “forest expert,” _Fokel_,\r\nthe increase of forest area by sowing oak, etc., in the poorly wooded\r\ndistricts, was also inaugurated; and this planting was made obligatory,\r\nnot only on the administration of crown forests, but also upon private\r\nowners, who in case of default were to lose their land and have it\r\nreforested by the forest administration. To Fokel’s initiative is also\r\nto be credited the celebrated larch forest on the Gulf of Finland.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions of private rights and the tutelage exercised by the\r\nforest administration were abolished _in toto_ by Catherine II, in 1788,\r\nand although it was reported by the admiralty, concerned in the supply\r\nof shipbuilding materials, that as a consequence the cutting,\r\nespecially of oak timber, was proceeding rapidly, no new restrictive,\r\nbut rather an ameliorative policy was attempted, such as, for instance,\r\nthe offering of prizes for plantations in certain localities by the\r\nprovincial governors.\r\n\r\nUpon the abolishment of the serfdom of the peasants, under Alexander II,\r\nin 1863, lands, both farm and woodlands, were allotted to them, and in\r\nthis partition, in some parts as much as 25 to 50% of this forest\r\nproperty was handed over to them. Immediately a general slaughtering,\r\nboth by peasants and by the private owners, who had suffered by losing\r\nthe services of the serfs, was inaugurated, leading to wholesale\r\ndevastation.\r\n\r\nServitudes or rights of user also prevailed in some districts and proved\r\nextremely destructive.\r\n\r\nBy 1864, complaints in regard to forest devastation had become so\r\nfrequent that a movement for reform was begun by the Czar, which led to\r\nthe promulgation of a law in 1867, followed by a number of others during\r\nthe next decade, designed to remedy the evils. This was to be done by\r\nrestricting the acreage that might be felled, by forbidding clearings,\r\nand by giving premiums for good management and plantations. Finally, in\r\n1875, a special commission was charged with the elaboration of a general\r\norder which, after years of hearing of testimony and of deliberation,\r\nwas promulgated in 1888, a comprehensive law for the conservation of\r\nforests, private and otherwise, which in many respects resembles the\r\nFrench, in other respects the Swedish conservation laws.\r\n\r\nThe devastation and its evil consequences on waterflow and soil\r\nconditions had been especially felt in the southern districts adjoining\r\nthe steppe, and these experiences were the immediate cause for the\r\nenactment of the law, which, however, was framed to apply conditionally\r\nto the entire European Russia.\r\n\r\nThe law makes an interesting distinction between “protective,”\r\n“protected” and non-protective, or unprotected forests, as well as\r\nbetween different ownership classes, and it makes distinction of four\r\nregions as to the extent of its application. In the far northern\r\ngovernments, densely forested (60%) and thinly populated, only the\r\nprotective forests are under the operations of the law. In the Caucasus\r\nalso, none of the restrictions of private property except in protective\r\nand communal peasant forests are to apply, perhaps because the forest\r\narea (averaging not over 17%) is there largely owned by members of the\r\nimperial house and by nobles. In certain districts adjoining the\r\nnorthern zone (with 37% forest) also only the last two classes of\r\nforest, namely protective and communal properties, with institute\r\nforests added, are subject to the provisions of the law. The rest, a\r\nterritory of over one million square miles with only 12% in forest, is\r\nsubject to all the provisions of the law, which is remarkably democratic\r\nin treating State, imperial and private forests alike.\r\n\r\nThis law declares as “protective forests,” to be managed under special\r\nplans prescribed by the Crown forest department, those forest areas\r\nwhich protect shifting sands and dunes, the shores of rivers, canals\r\nand other waters; and those on the slopes of mountains, where they serve\r\nto prevent erosion, landslides and avalanches.\r\n\r\nConversion of these protective forests to farm use is forbidden, and the\r\nuse of a clearing system in forest management, as well as pasturage and\r\nother uses supposed to be detrimental, may be interdicted, and the\r\nmethod of management may be prescribed. An instruction regarding the\r\nexecution of the law promulgated in 1889 prohibited clear cutting in\r\nconifer forests, permitting only selection forest, and in especially\r\nendangered localities only the use of the dry wood and such trees as\r\ninterfere with natural reproduction.\r\n\r\n“Protected” forests are those which are located at the head waters and\r\nupper reaches of streams and their affluents. Here the rules as regards\r\nclearing, mismanagement, reforestation and pasture applicable to the\r\nnon-protective forests, prevail, except that clearing may be prohibited\r\nor permitted, if the committee deems it not dangerous owing to the small\r\nsize of the clearing.\r\n\r\nIn forests, which are not protective forests, conversion into farms or\r\nclearing with the sanction of the committee is permitted, if thereby the\r\nestate is improved, _e.g._, if the soil is fit for orchards and\r\nvineyards. Such clearing may also be allowed if the soil is fit for\r\ntemporary field use, but in that case the area must be eventually\r\nreforested. Clearing is also permitted, if another formerly farmed\r\nparcel of the same size has been reforested at least three years prior\r\nto the proposed clearing; or if in artificial plantations the growth is\r\nnot yet 20 years old; also in a few special cases where property\r\nboundaries are to be rounded off, roads to be located, etc. If after six\r\nmonths from the time of the application the committee has not forbidden\r\nthe clearing, it is considered as permitted. It is also forbidden to\r\nmake fellings which prevent natural regeneration, and the running of\r\ncattle in young growth is prohibited. Private owners are not required,\r\nbut are permitted, to submit working plans, and if these are accepted,\r\nthey are exempted from any other restrictions. Such plans may be\r\nconsidered as accepted if the committee does not express itself within\r\none year. All clearings made in contravention to the committee’s\r\ndecision must be replanted within a prescribed time or may be forcibly\r\nreforested by the committee.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature, because thoroughly democratic, is the\r\ncreation of the local forest protection committees, which are formed in\r\neach province and district, composed of various representatives of the\r\nlocal administration, one or two foresters included, the justice of the\r\npeace or other justice, the county council and two elected forest\r\nowners, in all nine to eleven members, under the presidency of the\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nThis committee is vested with large powers. It decides, without appeal,\r\nwhat areas are included in protective forests and approves of the\r\nworking plans for these as well as for the unreserved forests; it\r\ndetermines what clearings may be made, and exercises wide police powers\r\nwith reference to all forest matters working in co-operation with the\r\nForest Administration, which latter has the duty of making working\r\nplans free of charge for the reserved forests, and, at the expense of\r\nthe owner for the private unreserved forests. Owners of the latter are,\r\nhowever, at liberty to prepare their own plans subject to approval.\r\nAppeal from decisions of the Forest Committees lies through the\r\nCommittee to the Minister of Crown lands and Minister of the Interior.\r\n\r\nIn case the owner refuses to incur the extra expense arising from\r\nmeasures imposed upon him, the domain ministry may expropriate him, but\r\nthe owner may recover within 10 years by paying costs with 6% interest\r\nin addition to the sale price. In addition to the above cited and other\r\nrestrictive measures, some ameliorative provisions are also found. All\r\nprotective forests are free from taxes forever; those artificially\r\nplanted also for 30 years.\r\n\r\nSome of the best forest officials are detailed to give advice\r\ngratuitously to forest owners (forest revisor--instructors) and prizes\r\nare given for the best results of silvicultural operations. At the\r\nrecommendation of the Forest Committees, medals or money rewards or\r\nother distinctions are given to the forest guards and forest managers of\r\nprivate as well as public forests. Plant material is distributed free or\r\nat cost price, and working plans for protective forests are made free of\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Loan Bank advances long term loans on forests, based upon\r\ndetailed working plans made by the State, which insure a conservative\r\nmanagement. In 1900, over 7,000,000 acres were in this way mortgaged\r\nunder such management.\r\n\r\nThe minutest details are elaborated in the instructions for the\r\nexecution of this most comprehensive law. How far this law is really\r\nexecuted and what its results so far have been, it would be difficult to\r\nascertain. It is, however, believed that it has worked satisfactorily.\r\nBy 1900, 1.5 million acres had been declared protection forests, nearly\r\n2 million protected or river forests, and nearly 100 million private and\r\ncommunal forests had been placed under the regime. In 1907, the total\r\narea under the regime had grown to over 136 million acres. Of private\r\nforests, 18 million acres in 6015 forests were being managed according\r\nto working plans made or approved by the forest committees. In these\r\nplans, usually, the strip system or seed tree system with natural\r\nregeneration under 60 year rotation for conifers, and at least 30 year\r\nrotation for broadleaf forest, is provided.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, the application of the law was extended to the Caucasus, the\r\nTrans-caucasian and other southern provinces, but in the absence of\r\nsuitable personnel and in a half civilized country, no result for the\r\nimmediate future may be anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe surveillance of the execution of this law lies, with the assistance\r\nof the Forest Committees, in the hands of the State Forest\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nThis latter, centralized in the Department of Agriculture, consists of a\r\nDirector General with two Vice-Directors and a so-called bureau of\r\nforests with seven division chiefs, a number of vice-inspectors and\r\nassistants. The local administration in the governments is represented\r\nby the Direction of Crown lands with a superintendent or supervisor and\r\nseveral inspectors. The crown forests, divided into some 1260\r\nadministrative units, are under the administration of superintendents,\r\nwith foresters and guards of several degrees.\r\n\r\nThe whole service comprised, in 1908, about 3790 higher officials, some\r\n850 of whom in the central office at St. Petersburg, and over 30,000\r\nlower officials some 20,000 of whom are educated underforesters.\r\n\r\nLarge as this force appears to be, it is small in comparison with the\r\nacreage, and inadequate. Although the net income from the 300 million\r\nacres of State forest which are actually worked is now close to thirty\r\nmillion dollars, the expenditures being near 6 million, the pay of the\r\nofficials is such as to almost force them to find means of subsistence\r\nat the cost of their charges. Perhaps nowhere else is there so much\r\nmachinery and so much regulation with so little execution in practice.\r\nNevertheless, progress is being made in gradually improving matters, and\r\nthe forest property, or at least the cut, has become more and more\r\nvaluable. While in the middle of the last century the income from the\r\ndomain forest was only $500,000, by 1892 it had grown to $10,000,000, by\r\n1901 to $23,000,000, in 1908 to nearly $30,000,000, besides several\r\nmillion dollars’ worth of free wood. In 1908, the department spent over\r\nhalf a million dollars on planting and assisting natural regeneration.\r\nTimber is sold as a rule to contractors by the tree or acre, and a\r\ndiameter limit is almost the only restriction. In 1897, however, an\r\narrangement was made by which the lumberman was obliged to reforest, or\r\nat least to pay a certain tax into a planting fund, and a part payment\r\nof $2 to $4 per acre as guarantee must be made before cutting. This\r\norder has, however, remained mostly a dead letter, the buyer preferring\r\nto allow his guarantee to lapse. In 1906, there stood $3,000,000 to the\r\ncredit of this planting fund, and only half of it had been applied.\r\nMeanwhile the unplanted area increases, since natural regeneration\r\ngenerally proves a failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Education and Literature._\r\n\r\nThe attempts at forestry education date back to the year 1732 when a\r\nnumber of foresters were imported from Germany to take charge of the\r\nforest management as well as of the education of foresters, each\r\nforstmeister having six pupils assigned to him. This method failing to\r\nproduce results, the interest in ship timber suggested a course in\r\nforestry at the Naval Academy, which was instituted in 1800. Soon the\r\nneed of a larger number of educated foresters led to the establishment\r\nof several separate forest schools, one at Zarskoye Selo (near St.\r\nPetersburg) in 1803, another at Kozlovsk in 1805, and a third at St.\r\nPetersburg in 1808. This latter under the name of the Forest Institute\r\nabsorbed the other two, and from 1813 has continued to exist through\r\nmany vicissitudes. Now, with 15 professors and instructors and an\r\nexpenditure of nearly $250,000, and over 500 students, it is the largest\r\nforest school in the world. It prepares in a four years’ course for the\r\nhigher positions in the forest service. “The history of this Forest\r\nInstitute is practically the history of forestry in Russia.”\r\n\r\nA second school at Novo-Alexandria, near Warsaw, was instituted in 1860.\r\nIn these schools, as in the methods of management, German influence is\r\neverywhere visible.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these schools, chairs of forestry were instituted in the\r\nPetrovsk School of Rural Economy in Moskau and in the Riga Polytechnic\r\nInstitute, and also in seven intermediate schools of rural economy.\r\n\r\nIn 1888, ten secondary schools were established after Austrian pattern\r\nfor the lower or middle service, rangers and underforesters; their\r\nnumber, by 1900, having been increased to 30 and, in 1908, to 33, with\r\n460 students. These are boarding schools in the woods, where a certain\r\nnumber of the students are taught free of charge, the maximum number of\r\nthose admitted being 10 to 20 at each school. The course is of two\r\nyears’ duration, and is mainly directed to practical work and\r\ntheoretical study in silviculture. The total expense of such a school is\r\nabout $3,300, of which the State contributes $2,500, the total\r\nexpenditure, in 1908, being $84,134.\r\n\r\nA number of experiment stations were established in various parts of the\r\ncountry by the Administration of Crownlands, and a very considerable and\r\nadvanced literature testifies to the good education and activity of the\r\nhigher forest service.\r\n\r\nTwo forestry journals, _Lesnoj Journal_ (since 1870) and\r\n_Lessopromychlenny Vestnik_, the first bi-monthly, the latter weekly,\r\nbesides several lesser ones, keep the profession informed.\r\n\r\nThere are in existence several general societies for the encouragement\r\nof silviculture. Probably the oldest, which ceased to exist in 1850,\r\nwas the Imperial Russian Society for the Advancement of Forestry which\r\nwas founded in 1832. It published a magazine and provided translations\r\nof foreign books, among which the Forest Mathematics of the noted German\r\nforester König, who also prepared yield tables for the Society. (See p.\r\n135.) A society of professional foresters was founded at St. Petersburg\r\nin 1871, another exists in Moscow, and recently two associations for the\r\ndevelopment of forest planting in the steppes have been formed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent writers and practitioners there should be especially\r\nmentioned _Theodor Karlowitsch Arnold_, who is recognized as the father\r\nof Russian forestry. He was the soul of the forest organization work,\r\nfor which he drew up the instructions in 1845, and as professor,\r\nafterwards director, of the Institute for Agronomy and Forestry at\r\nMoscow since 1857, he became the teacher of most of the present\r\npractitioners. Finally he became the head of the forest department in\r\nthe Ministry of Apanages where he remained until his death in 1902. He\r\nis the author of several classical works on silviculture, forest\r\nmensuration, forest management, etc., and, in conjunction with _Dr. W.\r\nA. Tichonoff_, published an encyclopædic work in three volumes. In the\r\nfirst volume, _Russland’s Wald_ (1890), which has been translated into\r\nGerman, the author makes an extended plea for improved forestry practice\r\nand describes and argues at length the provisions of the law of 1888. In\r\n1895, he published a history of forestry in Germany, France and Russia.\r\nOf other prominent foresters who have advanced forestry in Russia we may\r\ncite _Count Vargaci de Bedemar_, who made the first attempt to prepare\r\nRussian growth and yield tables in 1840 to 1850.\r\n\r\n_Professor A. F. Rudzsky_, who was active at the Forest Institute until\r\na few years ago, developed in his volumes especially the mathematical\r\nbranches and methods of forest organization. The names of _Tursky_,\r\n_Kravchinsky_ and _Kaigodorov_ are known to Russian students of\r\ndendrology and silviculture, and among the younger generation the names\r\nof _Morozov_, _Nestorov_, _Orlov_, and _Tolsky_ may be mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt is well known how prominent Russian investigators have become in the\r\nnatural sciences, and to foresters the work of the soil physicists,\r\n_Otozky_ and _Dokuchaev_ would at least be familiar.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Forestry Practice._\r\n\r\nWhile then a very considerable activity in scientific direction exists,\r\nthe practical application of forestry principles is less developed than\r\none would expect, especially in view of the stringent laws. So far not\r\nmuch more than conservative lumbering is the rule.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the State and crown forests are better managed than\r\nthe private, many of which are being merely exploited; and in the\r\nnorthern departments large areas remain still inaccessible.\r\n\r\nSome notable exceptions to the general mismanagement of private forests\r\nare furnished by some of those owned by the nobility, like those of\r\nCount Uwaroff with 150,000 acres under model management by a German\r\nforester, and of Count Strogonoff with over 1,000,000 acres under\r\nfirst-class organization with a staff of over 230 persons.\r\n\r\nA regular forest organization was first attempted in the forests\r\nattached to iron furnace properties in 1840. By this time some 100\r\nmillion acres have come under regulated management, half of the area\r\nbeing government forests. The method of regulation employed is that of\r\narea division and sometimes area allotment according to Cotta. In some\r\nregions a division by rides into compartments, ranging from 60 to 4,000\r\nacres each, according to intensity of exploitation, has been effected.\r\nIt is estimated that at the present rate of progress it would take 300\r\nyears to complete the work of organization.\r\n\r\nThe selection method is still largely employed, a felling budget by\r\nnumber of trees and volume being determined in the incompletely\r\norganized areas; while a clearing system with artificial reforestation\r\nis used in most cases where a complete yield calculation has been made.\r\nThe rotations employed are from 60 to 100 years for timber forest, 30 to\r\n60 years for coppice.\r\n\r\nIn the pineries, the strip system in echelons is mostly in vogue, the\r\nstrips being made 108 feet wide, leaving four seed trees per acre, and\r\non the last strip, which is left standing for five years, this number is\r\nincreased to eight which are left as overholders. This method, according\r\nto some, seems to secure satisfactory reproduction. To get rid of\r\nundesirable species, especially aspen and birch, these are girdled. In\r\nspruce forest, 50 to 60 per cent. of the trees are left in the fellings,\r\nwhen after three to four years the natural regeneration requires often\r\nrepair, which is done if at all by bunch planting; after eight to ten\r\nyears the balance of the old growth is removed.\r\n\r\nWhile for a long time natural regeneration was alone relied upon, now,\r\nat least, artificial assistance is more and more frequently practiced.\r\nYet, although over 2 million acres were under clearing system, not more\r\nthan 5% of the revenue, or $100,000, was in 1898 allowed for planting as\r\nagainst 7.5% in Prussia; the total budget of expenses then remaining\r\nbelow 3 million dollars.\r\n\r\nBut, ten years later, over half a million dollars was employed by the\r\ngovernment in planting, the planting fund contributed by the lumberman\r\n(see p. 269) furnishing the means.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe forest administration of the province of Poland, where the State\r\nowns over 1.5 million acres was for some time independent, but, about\r\n1875, was reorganized and placed under the central bureau at St.\r\nPetersburg. Although the forests of Poland are the most lucrative to the\r\ngovernment and, with good market and high prices for wood, which are now\r\nrapidly increasing, would allow of intensive management, the stinginess\r\nof the administration, the low moral tone of the personnel, and long\r\nestablished bad practice have retarded the introduction of better\r\nmethods. The private forests of Poland comprise over 4.5 million acres,\r\nand are mostly not much better treated than the State forest; in the\r\nabsence of any restrictive policy they have diminished by 25% in the\r\nlast 20 years.\r\n\r\nConsiderable efforts have been made towards reforesting the steppes in\r\nsouthern Russia, first as in our own prairies and plains by private\r\nendeavor, but lately with more and more direct assistance of the State\r\nforest administration.\r\n\r\nThis planting was begun by German colonists at the end of the 18th\r\ncentury, but without encouraging results, although over 25,000 acres had\r\nbeen planted by the middle of the 19th century. Since 1843, the\r\ngovernment has had two experimental forest reserves in the steppes of\r\nthe governments of Ekaterinoslav and Tauride, on which some 10,000 acres\r\nhave been planted; the originator of this work being _von Graff_, a\r\nGerman forester, whose plantations, made with 8,000 plants to the acre,\r\nare still the best. Later, the number of plants was reduced to one-half,\r\nand the results have not been satisfactory. Altogether, planting on\r\nlarge areas on soils unfit for the purpose and by wrong methods has\r\nproduced poor results. At present the policy is not to create large\r\nbodies of forest, but to plant small strips of 20 to 80 yards square in\r\nregular distribution, which are to serve as windbreaks, and the result\r\nhas been satisfactory, especially in the government of Samara. There are\r\nnow annually 2,000 acres added to these plantations.\r\n\r\nThe reclamation of shifting sands and sand dunes has also received\r\nconsiderable attention and, to some extent, the reboisement of mountain\r\nslopes in the Crimea and Caucasus. Of the former, some 10 million acres\r\nare in existence in European Russia, and in the province of Woronesh\r\nalone each year 100,000 acres are added. For 50 years sporadical work in\r\ntheir recovery was done. Not until 1891 and 1892, when two droughty\r\nfamine years had led to an investigation of agricultural conditions, was\r\na systematic attempt proposed, and this was begun in 1897. By 1902, some\r\n80,000 acres had been fixed, and by 1904, 150,000 acres. In this work\r\nthe government contributes 36% of the cost, the benefited communities\r\nthe balance. In addition, 1,500 square miles of swamps in Western Russia\r\nwere reclaimed by extensive canals and recovered with meadow and forest\r\nat a cost of $300,000, of which the Imperial Treasury paid one-third,\r\nthe owners one-half, the local government the balance.\r\n\r\nWhile rational forest management, as we have seen, is far from being\r\ngenerally established, the government tries at least to prevent waste\r\nand to pave the way from exploitation to regulated management.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINLAND.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duchy of Finland in the northeast of Russia is still in some\r\nrespects independent of Russia.\r\n\r\nFinland, the “land of a thousand lakes” and of most extensive forests,\r\nis hardly less important as a wood producer than Russia itself; its wood\r\nexports amounting at present to around 200 million cubic feet and over\r\n25 million dollars in value, represent over 50 per cent. of its trade,\r\nand its most important resource.\r\n\r\nSettled in the 7th century by an Aryan tribe, the Finns, congeners of\r\nthe Magyars, who subdued the aboriginal Laplanders, Finland became by\r\nconquest in the 12th century, and remained for 500 years, a province of\r\nSweden. In the wars between Sweden and Russia; parts of this province\r\nwere conquered by Russia, and finally, in 1809, Sweden lost the whole;\r\nbut the Finns succeeded in preserving national unity and partial\r\nindependence under a constitution, adopted in 1772 and recognized by the\r\nCzar.\r\n\r\nFinland stands very much in the same relation to Russia as does Hungary\r\nto Austria, the union being merely a personal one: the Czar is the ruler\r\nor Grand Duke, but the administration is otherwise largely separate from\r\nthat of the empire, under a Governor-General, appointed by the Czar, and\r\na Senate of 18 members at Helsingfors, with a national parliament of the\r\nfour estates, nobles, clergy, burgers, peasants, which convenes every\r\nfive years; the Czar having the veto power over its legislation. The War\r\nDepartment of Russia, however, is in charge of military affairs, and\r\nother departments seem to be under more or less supervision of the\r\nRussian administration. Lately repressive measures are threatening or\r\nhave nearly accomplished the destruction of this autonomy.\r\n\r\nOf the 145,000 square miles of territory, nearly 50% is occupied by\r\nlakes and bogs, marshes or tundra; less than 9 million acres (9.7%) is\r\nin farms, and 37.5 million acres or 42%, is forestland, actual or\r\npotential; The major part of this is located in the northern and eastern\r\nsections, where the population is scanty, agriculture little developed,\r\nand sand soils prevail. Beyond the 69th degree, forest growth ceases,\r\nand naturally near the forest limit the scrubby growth partakes of the\r\ncharacter of all northern forests. Not more than 2.5 million acres,\r\nmostly in the southwestern sections, are actually under cultivation; the\r\npopulation being short of 2.5 million.\r\n\r\nThe rigorous climate makes a large consumption of fuelwood necessary,\r\nand, since houses are also mostly built of wood, the home consumption is\r\nover 32 cubic feet per capita. Over 10 million cubic feet of pine are\r\nconsumed in making tar, and a like amount for paper pulp. The total cut\r\nis in the neighborhood of 370 million cubic feet, four-fifth of which\r\ncomes from private forests of the middle and southern area, and over\r\none-third of it is being exported.\r\n\r\nThe country generally is a tableland with occasional low hills. The\r\nforest consists principally of pine, the latter a variety of the Scotch\r\nPine (or species?), called Riga Pine which excels in straightness of\r\nbole and thrifty growth, and of spruce (10 per cent. of the whole,\r\nmainly in the southeast). Aspen, alder and birch, especially the latter,\r\nare considered undesirable weeds, and fire is used to get rid of them\r\nwhere coniferous aftergrowth is desired, although birch is also employed\r\nfor fuel, bobbins and furniture, and aspen for matches. Basswood, maple,\r\nelm, ash and some oak occur, and larch (_Larix sibirica_) was introduced\r\nsome 150 years ago.\r\n\r\nLong, severe winters and hot, dry summers produce slow growth, the pine\r\nin the north requiring 200 to 250 years, in the middle sections 140 to\r\n160 years to grow to merchantable size.\r\n\r\nFires, used in clearing, have from time to time run over large areas and\r\nhave nearly killed out the spruce except in the lowlands, but the pine\r\nbeing more resistant has increased its area and in spite of the\r\ndeterioration of the soil by fire reproduces well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOriginally the forest was communal property, but in 1524, Gustav Vasa\r\ndeclared all forest and water not specially occupied to belong to “God,\r\nKing and the Swedish Crown,” although he allowed the usufruct to the\r\npeople free of charge or nearly so. These rights of user are still the\r\nbane of the forest administration. Being left without supervision it\r\nmattered little who owned the land, the forest was ruthlessly exploited.\r\nLater, the rights of user thus originating were bought off by ceding\r\nlands to the peasants.\r\n\r\nNot until 1851 did an improvement in these conditions occur when a\r\nprovisional administration of the State forests was provided in\r\nconnection with the Land Survey; but a rational organization\r\nmaterialized only after an eminent German forester, v. Berg, Director of\r\nthe forest school of Tharandt, had been imported (1858) to effect a\r\nreconstruction. His advice was, however, only partially followed, and\r\nthe organization was not perfected until 1869.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately, a powerful opposition to the administration\r\ndeveloped, because it could not at once show increased profits, and the\r\npersonnel which had been scanty enough, was still further reduced, the\r\nlarge districts into which the State property had been divided were\r\nstill further enlarged, and to this day, improvement in these respects\r\nhas been only partial.\r\n\r\nThe State forest area, situated mainly in the north is stated as between\r\n35 and 45 million acres (variable because of clearing for farms and new\r\nsettlements), but it contains about 15 million acres of bogs and moors\r\nand much other waste land, which reduces the productive forest area to\r\nabout 12 million acres (35%), leaving 65% of the productive forest area\r\nto private ownership.\r\n\r\nThis State forest was divided (1896) into 53 districts, the districts\r\nbeing aggregated into 8 inspections, and the whole service placed under\r\na central office with a forest director and 5 assistants under immediate\r\ncontrol of the Senate. The forest guards numbered 750, their ranges\r\naveraging 50,000 acres, while the districts average 600,000 acres and\r\nseveral contain as high as 2.5 million acres; the Forstmeister in charge\r\nmay live sometimes 200 miles from the nearest town and 60 miles from the\r\nnearest road. His function is mainly to protect the property, to\r\nsupervise the cutting and sales, and to teach the people the need of\r\nconservative methods. In spite of this insufficient service,\r\nconsiderable reduction in forest fires and theft has been attained.\r\n\r\nBeyond restriction of waste by axe and fire, and conservative lumbering\r\nof the State forest, positive measures for reproduction have hardly yet\r\nbeen introduced, both personnel and wood values being insufficient for\r\nmore intensive management.\r\n\r\nAt present, with a cut hardly exceeding 100 million cubic feet, the\r\nrevenue is still almost nominal, say $600,000, and hardly the annual\r\ngrowth is cut.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSelection forest is, of course, the rule, but since no trees are marked\r\nand cut less than 10 inch diameter at 25 feet from the ground (!), at\r\nleast the possibility for improved management will not be destroyed\r\nwhen, through the exhaustion of the private forests and increased wood\r\nprices, more intensive management has become practicable.\r\n\r\nWhen the market is good, a clearing system with 100 to 160 year rotation\r\nis practised; on the clearings about 20 seed trees are left, and after 6\r\nyears the natural regeneration is repaired by planting.\r\n\r\nThis latter method is especially prescribed on the government farms.\r\nThese form an interesting part of the State property, some 900 small\r\nfarms with woodlots aggregating over 500,000 acres, mostly in the\r\nsouthern districts. These came into existence in the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies, being granted as fiefs to officers of the army as their only\r\ncompensation. They reverted to the State and are rented for terms of 50\r\nyears upon condition that the woods are to be managed according to rules\r\nlaid down by the State department; and special inspectors are provided\r\nto supervise this work. This system, in vogue since 1863, at first met\r\nwith opposition on the part of the renters on account of the impractical\r\npropositions of the department. At present the department manages many\r\nof these woodlots directly, as well as those which the clergy have\r\nreceived in lieu of emoluments.\r\n\r\nSince 1883, a corps of forest surveyors has been occupied in making\r\nworking plans based upon diameter accretion at the curiously selected\r\nheight of 25 feet from the ground. A commission was also instituted some\r\nyears ago to segregate forest and farm soils in the State domain with a\r\nview of disposing of the latter preparatory to improved management of\r\nthe remaining forest area.\r\n\r\nThe State has also in a small way begun to purchase absolute forest\r\nsoils in the southern provinces with a view to reforestation.\r\n\r\nThe private forest areas, located in the more settled southern portions\r\nare found mostly in small parcels and in peasants’ hands, although the\r\nnobility also owns some forest properties, but the size of single\r\nholdings rarely exceeds 1,000 acres. These areas are mostly exploited\r\nwithout regard to the future, furnishing still four-fifths of the large\r\nexport, and according to competent judges will soon be exhausted.\r\n\r\nAlthough attempts have been made from time to time to restrict the use\r\nof private forest, practically little has been accomplished, and such\r\nrestrictions as have been enacted are hardly enforced.\r\n\r\nA law, enacted in 1886, forbids clearing along waters adapted to\r\nfishing, and orders the leaving of seed trees or “providing otherwise\r\nfor regeneration,” if more than 12 acres are cut at one time.\r\n\r\nThe method of utilizing the ground for combined forest and farm use,\r\nwhich is still frequently practised, was forbidden on the light sandy\r\nsoils of the pineries, or was otherwise regulated. Forest fire laws are\r\nalso on the statutes.\r\n\r\nPropositions for further restrictions, made in 1891, were promptly\r\nrejected by the parliament.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEducational opportunities are offered in the Forest Institute at Evois,\r\nfirst established in 1862 as a result of v. Berg’s visit, and\r\nre-organized in 1874. It accepts new students only every second year for\r\nthe two years’ course. It has had a precarious existence, being left\r\nsometimes without students, and is naturally not of a high grade,\r\npractical acquaintance with woodswork being its main aim.\r\n\r\nSince 1876, a school for forest guards and private underforesters has\r\nbeen in existence, where 6 students are annually accepted for a two\r\nyears’ course.\r\n\r\nIn addition there are two instructors provided by the government,\r\nwandering teachers who are to advise private owners. Premiums are paid\r\nfor the best managed woodlots on the government farms.\r\n\r\nThe Finnish forestry association, which is in part of propagandist\r\nnature, was organized in 1877. It supplies, besides an annual report,\r\nother forestry literature, and employs an experienced planter to direct\r\nefforts at reforestation.\r\n\r\nA forestry journal (quarterly) is also published, and a professional\r\nliterature is beginning to start into existence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest in this connection to cite a rough calculation\r\nmade by Dr. Mayr of the available material in European Russia and\r\nFinland combined, which he places at 4,500 million cubic feet, and of\r\nwhich he considers one-half available for export.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to prognosticate what position Russia and Finland,\r\ntogether the largest wood producers in Europe, will take in the future\r\nworld commerce, and how rapidly better practices, for which the\r\nmachinery is already half started, will become generally adopted. At\r\npresent, especially in Russia proper, the general corruption of the\r\nbureaucracy is an almost insurmountable obstacle to improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCANDINAVIAN STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the English language the _Report on Forestry in Sweden_, by Gen.\r\n  C. C. ANDREWS, U. S. Minister at Stockholm, 1872, revised 1900, 35\r\n  pp., gives a statement of present conditions with historical notes.\r\n\r\n  A very good idea in detail of the wood trade of Sweden may be\r\n  obtained from _The Wood Industries of Sweden_, published by TIMBER\r\n  TRADES JOURNAL of London in 1896.\r\n\r\n  _La Suède, son Peuple et son industrie_, by G.

LÜTKEN, 1900, was\r\n  not accessible to the writer.\r\n\r\n  Extensive notes are found through the German, Austrian and French\r\n  forestry journals. Especially an article in the Centralblatt für das\r\n  gesammte Forstwesen, 1905 (briefed in Forestry Quarterly, vol. III,\r\n  p. 292) and another (briefed in same Quarterly, vol. IX, p. 45)\r\n  gives extended accounts of forest conditions in Sweden.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of Scandinavian States we may comprise the countries of\r\nSweden, Norway and Denmark, which were settled by the same group of\r\nGerman tribes, the so-called Norsemen; they originally spoke the same\r\nlanguage, which only later became more or less differentiated. The\r\nsettlement of the country by these tribes seems to have been\r\naccomplished in the main by the end of the 8th century; and the\r\nseparation into the three several kingdoms in the ninth to twelfth\r\ncenturies, during which time they were sometimes united, or at least\r\nunder one ruler, sometimes at war with each other, and always torn by\r\ninterior dissensions bordering on anarchy.\r\n\r\nIn 1397, by the Calmar convention, a more permanent union into one\r\nkingdom was effected between Sweden, Norway, and Denmark under Margaret,\r\n“the Semiramis of the North.” After another period of variable fortunes,\r\nSweden, about 1523, became an independent constitutional monarchy under\r\nGustav Vasa, and Norway remained joined to Denmark under Frederick I.\r\n\r\nSweden then started on a career of conquest, being almost continuously\r\nat war with all her neighbors and especially with Russia and Poland,\r\nwhereby, especially under Gustavus Adolphus and the adventurous Charles\r\nXII, her territory was greatly enlarged. With the treaties of Stockholm\r\nand Nystadt (1720 and 1721) she came into more peaceful waters, but\r\npermanent peace and a settled policy was not attained until the election\r\nof Bernadotte, one of Napoleon’s administrators, to the kingship, and by\r\nthe peace of Kiel, in 1814, Sweden became a constitutional hereditary\r\nmonarchy in the modern sense. At the same time, Norway was taken away\r\nfrom Denmark and forced to a union with Sweden, which persisted until\r\n1907, when a peaceful separation took place by the action of the\r\nNorwegian people. The union has always been hateful to the Norwegians,\r\nalthough only the king and the department of foreign affairs (in which\r\nNorway was represented by a delegation from its Council) were in common,\r\nall other matters of administration being separate as well as the\r\nparliaments (Storthing in Norway, and Riksdag in Sweden).\r\n\r\nDenmark, powerful in the 11th century under Canute, who subjugated not\r\nonly Norway but England, losing both these countries shortly after his\r\ndeath, was shorn by Sweden of much of its territory in the 17th century,\r\nand, in 1814, was separated from Norway. Originally an elective\r\nmonarchy, largely dominated by the nobility, the crown in 1661 became\r\nhereditary and absolute, and Sweden did not become a constitutional\r\nmonarchy until 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEDEN.\r\n\r\nThis country is of greatest interest to the world at large in forestry\r\nmatters, because it has been until lately the largest exporter of wood\r\nand has only just fully waked up to its need for a conservative forest\r\nmanagement: the law of 1903 promises to bring about very decided\r\nchanges, and to curtail the exports upon which other European nations so\r\nmuch rely.\r\n\r\nSweden, with 172,876 square miles, occupies the eastern two-thirds of\r\nthe Scandinavian peninsula. It is not like Norway, a mountain country,\r\nbut the greater part consists of low granitic hills. The mountain range\r\n(Koelen) which forms the boundary towards Norway falls off in a long\r\nslope towards the gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic sea, the coast being a\r\nbroad level plain, with a series of islands, larger or smaller, girdling\r\nthe outer coast line and forming an archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe country is cut into numerous water sheds, the many rivers (called\r\nelfs), furnishing means of transportation, expanding frequently into\r\nlakes (sjö) in the upper reaches, and falling with cataracts into the\r\nlower plain, giving rise to fine water powers. Eight per cent. of the\r\ntotal area is in lakes. Only 12 per cent. of the land area is in farms.\r\nThe forest area, with nearly 50 million acres, occupies nearly 48 per\r\ncent., leaving 40 per cent. waste land or otherwise occupied.\r\n\r\nHalf of the population of over 5 million pursues agriculture, while iron\r\nmanufacture and the lumber industry occupy one-quarter.\r\n\r\nOf the three main divisions of the country, the southern, Götaland, is\r\nrichest in lowlands and agricultural soils, and, as it has also a\r\nfavorable maritime climate, farming is the main industry. Here, a\r\npopulation of 50 to 60, and in parts up to 190 per square mile is found.\r\nBeech and oak are here the principal trees, with spruce occasionally\r\nintermixed.\r\n\r\nIn the central part, Svealand or Sweden proper, the forest region\r\nbegins, with pine and spruce, pure or in mixture, covering the granite\r\nhills and plateau; birch and other hardwoods, oak, beech, elm, basswood\r\nand aspen being found in the river valleys; but the third division,\r\nNorrland, is the forest region of commercial importance, the seat of the\r\nextensive export trade. It is a vast, almost unbroken forest country,\r\nwith hardly more than 3 people to the square mile, in the northernmost\r\npart, called Lapland, Laps and Finns forming a not inconsiderable part\r\nof the population. Pine and spruce are the timber trees, with White\r\nBirch intermixed. Towards the northern boundary the pine increases, in\r\nmore and more open stands as one goes northward into the drier climate.\r\nAn open stunted growth of birch and aspen forms the transition to the\r\ntreeless tundra.\r\n\r\nA treeless alpine region occupies the northwestern frontier, fringed at\r\nlower elevations by a belt of birch in natural coppice, a result of\r\nrepeated fires. The northeastern part is a level coast plain, but the\r\nclimate is too severe for agriculture and the forest growth also is\r\nshort and of inferior quality.\r\n\r\nLarge areas of swampland are found in nearly all parts, recoverable for\r\nfarm or forest use, and mismanaged and devastated forest areas are found\r\nall over the country.\r\n\r\nThe forest, nearly 10 acres per capita, on account of its accessibility\r\nto the sea by means of the many rivers, plays an important rôle in the\r\neconomy of Sweden, not only because it covers such a large area and\r\nfavorable composition (80% coniferous), but because it has long been a\r\nprominent source of income. Especially after the abolition of the\r\nEnglish import duties, in 1866, and of the Swedish export duties which\r\nhad restricted trade, in 1863, did a rapid increase in wood exports take\r\nplace, until in 1900, it amounted to over 54 million dollars (of which\r\n12 million for woodenware), being the leading export article and\r\nrepresenting over one-half of all exports.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this export which may represent at least a round 300\r\nmillion cubic feet of wood, there are about 250 million cubic feet of\r\npulpwood and 150 million feet used for charcoal, besides the domestic\r\nfuel consumption. The total draft on the forest may be estimated to\r\ncome near to 1,200 million cubic feet which is believed far in excess of\r\nthe annual growth, much of the nearly 50 million acres of forest area\r\nhaving been devastated or deteriorated by axe and fire and being located\r\nin a northern zone where the growth is slow (1 inch in 12 to 15 years).\r\nAccording to others, the cut remains below the increment by about 25 per\r\ncent., the latter being figured at 25 cubic feet per acre. In the State\r\nforests, to be sure, mostly located in the more northern tiers, the cut\r\nis kept between 6 and 7 cubic feet effective, but here a waste of\r\nsometimes 40% is incurred in the exploitation due to the difficulties in\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Property Conditions._\r\n\r\nIt was Gustav Vasa who, in 1542, declared all uncultivated lands the\r\nproperty of the Crown. Parts of them, however, were given to colonists,\r\nand these as well as the resident population had the right to use the\r\nneighboring forest to supply their needs for wood and pasture. By the\r\ncontinued exercise of this right, the forest came to be considered\r\ncommons, proprietary rights remaining long in doubt. Finally, a division\r\ncame about, some of the lands becoming the property of the parishes,\r\nothers of smaller districts (the hundreds), others again encumbered or\r\nunencumbered property of the State, and some remained in joint ownership\r\nof State and private individuals under various complicated conditions.\r\n\r\nThe State now owns somewhat over 16 million acres, of which, however,\r\nonly 70% are really forest, and controls more or less 4 million more, of\r\nwhich about 900,000 acres are ecclesiastical benefices and forests\r\nbelonging to public institutions, and 2.7 million acres in State farms,\r\nwhich are rented.\r\n\r\nSince 1875, the State has pursued a policy of purchase, which has added\r\nover 500,000 acres (at $7 per acre) to the domain. Lately, this policy\r\nhas found considerable opposition. In this way, by reforesting, and by\r\nsettlement of disputed titles the State property in absolute possession\r\nof the government has grown by nearly 5 per cent., to 10 million acres.\r\n\r\nIn Lapland the entire forest area used to belong to the State, but in\r\norder to attract settlers these were given forest property for their own\r\nuse, from 10 to 100 times the area which they had cleared. This forest\r\narea the settlers disposed of to wood merchants (lumbermen), until the\r\nlaw of 1873 intervened, restricting the settlers to the usufruct alone,\r\nthe government taking charge of the cutting of wood for sale and\r\nlimiting the cut to a diameter of 8 inch at 16 feet from the base.\r\n\r\nThis interference with what was supposed to be private rights seems to\r\nhave been resented, and has led to wasteful practices, in the absence of\r\na sufficient force of forest guards. Nevertheless the law was extended\r\nto Westerbotten in 1882.\r\n\r\nIn other provinces, Wermland, Gestrikland, etc., the government vested\r\nin the owners or ironworks the right to supply themselves with charcoal\r\nfrom State forests. But about the middle of the 19th century, when,\r\nowing to railroad development in other parts, some of the ironworks\r\nbecame unremunerative and were abandoned, their owners continued to\r\nhold on to the forest privileges, and by and by exercised them by\r\ncutting and sawing lumber for sale, or even by selling the forest areas\r\nas if they were their properties; and in this way these properties\r\nchanged hands until suddenly the government began to challenge titles,\r\nand commenced litigation, about 1896.\r\n\r\nGrants of certain log cutting privileges on government lands were also\r\nmade to sawmills in past times, usually by allowing sawmillers to cut a\r\ncertain number of logs annually at a very low price. In 1870 these\r\ngrants, which were very lucrative, were modified by substituting the\r\nright of an increased cut for a stated number of years at a modified\r\nprice, after which the grant was to cease. In 1900, there were still\r\nsome 300,000 acres under such grants.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that under these circumstances the value of the State forest\r\nproperty was, in 1898, assessed at only $1.60 per acre; the net income\r\nbeing $1,680,753, or about 12 cents per acre; the expenditures for\r\nadministration, supervision, and forest school amounting to $423,659, to\r\nwhich should be added an undetermined amount for the participation of\r\nthe domain bureau, the agricultural department and provincial\r\ngovernments, all taking part in the forest administration.\r\n\r\nMany of the towns and country districts (_haerad_) have received\r\ndonations of forest areas from the Crown, which have been a considerable\r\nsource of revenue to them. The parish of Orsa, e.g., realized from its\r\nforest property some 2.5 million dollars, and other similar results are\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nThese communal and institute forests of various description comprise\r\nsomewhat over 2.6 million acres, or 5.5%, and are placed under\r\nmanagement of local committees, with the governor of the province as\r\nchairman. The management consists in selling stumpage of all trees over\r\n13 inches in diameter 5 feet above ground, to be cut by the purchaser\r\nunder regulations.\r\n\r\nIn the years from 1840 to 1850, the government sold to English wood\r\nmerchants considerable tracts of timberland, and in the latter part of\r\nthe 19th century, as the sawmill industry expanded, many mill firms\r\nacquired wood-cutting leases for 50 year terms for prices which were\r\noften realized from the forest in the first winter. At present longer\r\nleases than for 20 years are prohibited by law. The diameter limit of 12\r\ninches, 18 or 20 feet above ground, was usually the basis of the leases;\r\nand as the owners could then lease away other sizes, it might happen\r\nthat 2 or 3 persons besides the original owner would have property\r\nrights in the same forest. Of late years many of the mill owners have\r\nendeavored to get rid of the resulting inconvenience by buying the\r\nfee-simple of the land. This movement has resulted in the aggregation of\r\nlarge areas in single hands or more often in the hands of large mill\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nBy the acquisition of these properties a certain amount of cultivated\r\nland is usually included, which is then left to the former owner at a\r\nnominal rent, provided that he pays the taxes on the whole; thereby\r\ncreating a class of renters in lieu of owners of farms. The area thus\r\nprivately owned, mostly by sawmill companies, must be over 25 million\r\nacres; the total private forest area, which includes the bulk of the\r\ncommercial forest, is about 30 million acres (61.3%), unreclaimable\r\nwaste lands swelling the figure to over 50 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Development of Forest Policy._\r\n\r\nFrom the times of Olaf Tratâlja, the first Christian king of Sweden\r\n(about 1000 A.D.), who gained fame by the part he took in exploiting the\r\nforests of Wermland, down to the 14th century Sweden suffered from a\r\nsuperabundance of forest. Nevertheless, by the end of that century\r\nrestriction of the wilful destruction by fire was felt necessary, and an\r\nordinance with that object in view was promulgated.\r\n\r\nIt is questionable whether this order had any effect in a country, where\r\nthe homestead law provided, that a settler might take up “as much\r\npasture and arable land as he could make use of, twice as much forest,\r\nand in addition on each side of this homestead as much as a lame man\r\ncould go over on crutches without resting.”\r\n\r\nNot till 1638, do we again find an attempt at forest conservancy, this\r\ntime in the interest of supply of charcoal for the iron industry, by the\r\nappointment of overseers of the public forests.\r\n\r\nThe first general forest code, however, dates from 1647, which among\r\nother useless prescriptions made the existing usage of planting two\r\ntrees for every one cut obligatory, and this provision remained on the\r\nstatutes until 1789. In spite of this and other, restrictive, laws,\r\nexploitation by the liege lords and the communities continued until, in\r\n1720, a director of forests for the two southern districts, Halland and\r\nBohus, was appointed, and, at least in this part of the country, the\r\nexecution of the laws was placed under a special officer.\r\n\r\nThis appointment may be considered the first germ of the later forest\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nA policy of restriction seems to have prevailed during the entire 18th\r\ncentury, although it is questionable whether the restrictions were\r\nenforced since there was no personnel to watch over their enforcement,\r\nand the governors, in whose hands the jurisdiction lay, had other\r\ninterests, more engrossing. A law, enacted in 1734, restricted the\r\npeasant forest owners in the sale of wood from their own properties,\r\nand, in 1789, this restriction and other supervision was extended to\r\nthose of the nobility.\r\n\r\nIt appears that soon after this a considerable sentimental solicitude\r\ninside and outside the Riksdag was aroused regarding an apprehended\r\ndeterioration of climate as well as scarcity of wood as a result of\r\nfurther forest destruction--in the light of present experience a rather\r\namusing anticipation. These jeremiads, however, after an unsatisfactory\r\nattempt at legislation in 1793, led, in 1798, to the appointment of a\r\ncommission which reported after 5 years of investigation. A new set of\r\nforest regulations was enacted as a result in 1805.\r\n\r\nIn further prosecution of these attempts at regulating forest use a\r\ncommissioner, Prof. F. W. Radloff, was sent to Germany, in 1809, to\r\nstudy methods employed in that country. Long before that time, about\r\n1762, some of the iron masters, owning large forest areas had imported\r\na commission of German forest experts (among them von Langen and\r\nZanthier, the same who had done similar work in Norway and Denmark) with\r\na view of systematizing the forest use; but apparently without result.\r\n\r\nAfter much discussion of Radloff’s report, and consultation with the\r\nprovincial governors, who suggested the propriety of different plans for\r\ndifferent localities, new legislation was had in 1810, 1818, 1823, and\r\nnew regulations for the crown forests were issued in 1824.\r\n\r\nYet at this very time not only the partition of the communal forests but\r\nalso the sale of town forests was ordered; and this policy of\r\ndismemberment lasted till 1866, over 1 million acres having been sold by\r\nthat time. Nor was any diminution in wasteful practices to be noted as a\r\nresult of legislation, and it seems that, while on the one hand\r\nrestrictive policies were discussed and enacted, on the other hand\r\nunconservative methods were encouraged. Indeed, in 1846, the then\r\nexisting restrictions of the export trade were removed; apparently a\r\nreversion of restrictive policy had set in, and exploitation increased,\r\nin the belief of inexhaustible supplies. On the other hand,\r\nencouragement of reforestation was sought by giving bounties for\r\nplanting waste land and for leaving a certain number of seed trees in\r\nthe felling areas, also by paying rewards for the best plantations; all\r\nwithout result.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a check to the wood trade had occurred through the imposition\r\nof exorbitant customs duties by Great Britain, and at the same time the\r\ngovernment imposed an export duty to discourage export from Norrland,\r\nand this was not abated until 1857.\r\n\r\nA further project of forest supervision was attempted through a report\r\nby a new commission appointed in 1828, which formulated rules for the\r\ncontrol of public and private forests, and recommended the establishment\r\nof a Central bureau for the management of forest affairs, as well as the\r\norganization of a Forest Institute, for the teaching of forestry. This\r\nInstitute was established at Stockholm in 1828, but, instead of\r\norganizing the bureau, the director of that institute was charged with\r\nthe duties of such bureau. Again for years, committee reports followed\r\neach other, but led to no satisfactory solution of the problems.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, however, a forestry corps (_skogstaten_) was organized for the\r\nmanagement of the State forests under the direction of the Forest\r\nInstitute, and, as a result of persistent propaganda, the central bureau\r\nof forest administration (_skogsstyrelsen_) was created in 1859 with\r\n_Björkman_ at the head, charged with the supervision of all the State,\r\nroyal, communal and other public forests, and the control of private\r\nforest use.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1859, however, did not settle upon any new policy of control\r\nover private forest properties. Again and again, forest committees were\r\nappointed to propose proper methods of such control, but not until 1903\r\nwas a general law enacted, which was to go into effect on January 1,\r\n1905.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this, locally applicable laws were enacted. In 1866, a law\r\nwas passed which referred only to a particular class of private lands,\r\nnamely those forests of Norrland which the State was to dispose of for\r\nground rent, or which had been disposed of and on which the conditions\r\nof settlement had not been fulfilled. In 1869, a law applicable only on\r\nthe island of Gotland provided a dimension limit, and that in case of\r\nneglect of regeneration on private fellings the owner may not cut any\r\nmore wood for sale, until the neglect had been remedied.\r\n\r\nExactly in the same manner as the homestead and other colonization laws\r\nin the United States have been abused to get hold of public timber\r\nlands, so in Sweden large areas of government land had been taken up for\r\nsettlement, but actually were exploited. It was to remedy this evil that\r\nin 1860 an examination of the public lands was ordered with a view of\r\nwithdrawing portions from settlement and of making forest reservations.\r\nThe royal ordinance of 1866 resulted, which was to regulate the cutting\r\non settled lands and in such new settlements as were thereafter allowed.\r\n\r\nHere, private owners at first were allowed to cut only for their own\r\nuse, and the new law prescribed the amount of yearly cut and required\r\nthe marking of timber designed for sale by the government officers.\r\n\r\nThis “compulsory marking” or “Lapland” law with a dimension limit, was,\r\nin 1873, extended to all private forests in Norbotten, and in 1888, to\r\nVesterbotten. This law limits the diameter to which fellings are to be\r\nmade (8 inches at 15 feet from base), and if the cutting of smaller\r\ntrees is deemed desirable for the benefit of the forest these are to be\r\ndesignated by forest officials.\r\n\r\nThe law for Gotland was renewed in 1894, adding a reforestation clause,\r\nthe governor being authorized to prohibit shipping of timber under 8\r\ninch diameter, and that not until new growth was established; or at\r\nleast no new fellings may be made until this condition is fulfilled. The\r\nsame law applies to sand dune plantations in other, southern districts.\r\nAltogether one-quarter of the private forest property was in this manner\r\nsubjected to restrictions, until the present conservation law came into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThis law, of 1903, which became operative in 1905, was the result of a\r\nmost painstaking, extended canvass by the legislative committee,\r\nappointed in 1896, which reported in 1899, and of a further canvass by\r\nthe Director of Domains, who reported in 1901. A large amount of\r\ntestimony from private forest owners, sawmill men, provincial and local\r\ngovernment officials, etc., was accumulated, and it may be reasonably\r\nexpected that this new legislation will be more effective than most of\r\nthe preceding seems to have been.\r\n\r\nThe law requires in general terms the application of forestry principles\r\nin the management of private woodlands. For this purpose, a Forest\r\nProtection Committee, one for each province, is constituted which has\r\nsurveillance over all private forests, an institution similar to that\r\nexisting in Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Committee, or Forest Conservation Board, consists of three persons\r\nwho are appointed for three years, one by the government, one by the\r\nCounty Council, one by the managing committee of the County Agricultural\r\nSociety. In addition, where the communities desire, elected Forest\r\nConservation Commissioners may be instituted to make sure of the\r\nenforcement of the law. The Board secures the services of an expert\r\nadviser from the State forest service paid by the government but leaves\r\nto the Board discretion as to the interpretation of the law which is for\r\nthe most part expressed in general terms, to secure conservative\r\nmanagement. Hence different Boards have worked in different ways, but\r\ngradually all are coming to similar methods, and all apply persuasive\r\nmeans rather than force.\r\n\r\nThe law requires regeneration, but does not prescribe detail methods as\r\nto how re-growth is to be obtained, leaving these to be determined by\r\nthe Board in consultation with the owners. If no agreement can be\r\narrived at, or if the measures stipulated are not taken by the owner,\r\nthe Board may enforce its rulings by Court proceedings, in which\r\ninjunctions to prevent further lumbering, confiscation of logs, or of\r\nlumber, or money fines may be adjudged.\r\n\r\nThe time of contracts for logging rights is reduced from 20 to 5 years.\r\nShort courses of instruction to forest owners, and the issuing of\r\npopularly written technical publications (_Folkskrifter_) is one of the\r\nefficient methods of securing the result, which seems to have been\r\nattained in the few years since the law is in operation, namely in\r\narousing such interest that opposition has become very small.\r\n\r\nAn export duty (4 to 8 cents per 100 cubic feet of timber, 8 to 14 cents\r\nper ton of dry wood pulp) is levied for the purpose of carrying out the\r\nlaw the export duty amounting to over $160,000, and a more general\r\nexport duty is under contemplation.\r\n\r\nThe management of communal forest is to be placed under the State forest\r\nadministration, the corporations paying 1.6c. per acre; but this feature\r\ndoes not seem entirely settled.\r\n\r\nProtective forests under special regulations are established at the\r\nalpine frontier and on the drift-sand plains, which are planted up.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Forest Administration and Forestry Practice._\r\n\r\nThe central forestry bureau as it exists now was organized in 1883 as\r\nthe Domain Bureau in the Department of Agriculture with, at present, a\r\nforester as General Director, and under it a forestry corps\r\n(_skogstaten_) (reorganized in 1890) which has charge of the public\r\nforests, and also of the forest control in the private forests where\r\nsuch control exists outside of the Conservation Boards. For the purpose\r\nof this administration the country is divided into 10 districts, each\r\nunder an inspector (or _öfverjägmästare_); the districts are divided\r\ninto ranges (_revir_), now 90, each under a chief of range (or\r\n_jägmästare_) with assistants and guards (_kronojägare_); the\r\nnomenclature of the officers suggesting the hunt rather than the forest\r\nmanagement. In addition, 6 forest engineers are employed on working\r\nplans, engineering works, and in giving advice and assistance to private\r\nowners who pay for such service.\r\n\r\nWhen it is stated that the ranges in the northern provinces average over\r\n300,000 acres of public and 400,000 acres of private forest; in central\r\nSweden 150,000 acres of public and 145,000 acres of private forest, and\r\nin the southern provinces nearly 55,000 acres of State and communal\r\nforest, it will be understood that the control cannot be very strict.\r\n\r\nThe net revenue from the State forest during the last 30 years has\r\nincreased from $300,000 to $1,750,000.\r\n\r\nThe management of even the State forests can only be very extensive. The\r\nState still sells mostly stumpage, rarely cutting on its own account.\r\nThe lumbering is carried on very much as in the United States by logging\r\ncontractors, and the river driving is done systematically by booming\r\ncompanies. Selection forest is still the general practice, now often\r\nimproved into group system, although a clear cutting system with\r\nplanting has been practised, but is supposed to be less desirable,\r\nprobably because it entails a direct money outlay or else because it was\r\nnot properly done. A seed tree management preferred by private owners\r\nfor pine seems frequently not successful. Of the State forests 90% are\r\nunder selection system, and of the private forest 60%.\r\n\r\nIn the southern provinces where planting is more frequently resorted to,\r\n2-3 year old pines and 2-5 year old spruces, nursery-grown, 2,000 to the\r\nacre, are generally used or else sowing in seedspots is resorted to,\r\nwhich is more frequently practised in the middle country.\r\n\r\nSome 10,000 acres were, for instance, planted by the forest\r\nadministration in 1898, at a cost of $2 per acre, and the budget\r\ncontains annually about $20,000 for such planting.\r\n\r\nThat private endeavor in the direction of planting, has also been\r\nactive, is testified by a plantation of over 26,000 acres, now 35 years\r\nold, reported from Finspong Estate.\r\n\r\nComplete working plans are rare even for the State forests, a mere\r\nsummary felling budget being determined for most areas, the trees to be\r\ncut being marked.\r\n\r\nUnder instructions issued in 1896, working plans for the small\r\nproportion of State forest management by clearing system are to be made.\r\nIn these an area allotment method is employed with rotations of 100 to\r\n150 years.\r\n\r\nForest fires are still very destructive, especially in northern Sweden,\r\nalthough an effective patrol system, greatly assisted in some provinces\r\nby watch towers, has reduced the size of the areas burnt over. The\r\nconiferous composition and the dry summers in the northern part together\r\nwith the methods of lumbering are responsible for the conflagrations. In\r\nthis direction too, the activities of the Conservation Boards have been\r\nhighly useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Education and Literature._\r\n\r\nAmong the propagandist literature, which had advanced the introduction\r\nof forestry ideas in Sweden it is proper to mention the writings of\r\n_Israel Adolf of Ström_, who after extensive travels in Germany\r\nestablished the first private forest school in 1823, and was\r\ninstrumental in securing the establishment of the State Forest Institute\r\nin Stockholm (1828).\r\n\r\nIn regard to education a most liberal policy prevails.\r\n\r\nAt the Institute the tuition is free and in addition 4 students receive\r\nscholarships of 250 dollars per year; appointment to assistantships\r\nfollows immediately after promotion, and in 10 years the position of\r\njägmästare may be attained. The number of students is limited to 30. The\r\ndirector of this school is also general adviser in forestry matters.\r\nBesides the director, six professors are employed. The course at this\r\nschool is two years of 11 full months.\r\n\r\nThere are now a higher and a lower course, the former requiring previous\r\ngraduation from another preparatory forest school, either the one at\r\nOmberg (founded 1886), or that at Kloten (1900), where a one-year\r\ncourse, mainly in practical work, is given.\r\n\r\nFor the lower service there are not less than 6 schools in various parts\r\nof the country, each with one teacher and assistants, managed under a\r\nchief of range. In these, not only is tuition free but 10 pupils receive\r\nalso board and lodging; the course lasting 8 months. These schools\r\nprepare for State service, as well as for managers of private forests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA forest experiment station was organized in 1903, an independent\r\ninstitution in the Domain Bureau, under the direct charge of a\r\npractitioner. Every third year, a commission is to determine what work\r\nis to be undertaken. The appropriation, which so far is hardly $5,000\r\nper annum, will not permit much expansion. The first number of its\r\npublication, _Meddelanden fran Statens Skogsförsöksanstalt_, was issued\r\nin 1904, and work of a superior character has been accomplished since\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat a forestry public exists in Sweden is attested by a forest\r\nassociation with an organ _Skogsvards Föreningens Tidskrift_, which was\r\nfounded in 1902. This journal is really the continuation of an earlier\r\nmagazine, _Tidskrift for Skogshushallning_, a quarterly, begun in 1869\r\nand running until 1903. A forestry association for Norrland alone which\r\nalso issues a yearbook, was organized a few years ago. A periodical for\r\nrangers, etc., is also in existence under the name of _Skogsvännen_.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 also, there was formed a lumberman’s trust to regulate the\r\noutput, which the forest owners proposed to meet by an associated effort\r\nto raise stumpage charges. The attempt of the lumbermen to restrict the\r\ncut in 1902 was, however, a failure, for the export of that year was 10%\r\nlarger than the previous year.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the new law will have the tendency of decreasing the\r\ncut and of inaugurating a new era in forestry matters generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWAY.\r\n\r\nOriginally divided up among a number of petty kings, Norway was brought\r\nunder one rule by Harold in 863; and united to Denmark in the 11th\r\ncentury, becoming gradually a mere dependency. Its later political\r\nfortunes and changing relations with Denmark and Sweden have been\r\nreferred to on p. 286. The history of the forestry development, however,\r\nhas proceeded more or less independently of the other two countries.\r\n\r\nNorway, occupying with 124,445 square miles over one-third of the\r\nScandinavian peninsula, is for the most part a mountainous plateau with\r\ndeep valleys and lakes. Its numerous fjords and water ways make\r\naccessible much of the interior mountain forest, yet a large part of the\r\ninland area still remains inaccessible and trackless.\r\n\r\nMore than 75% of the country is waste land and water; only 3% in farms,\r\nleaving for the forest area 21%, or little over 17 million acres.\r\nAccording to latest data (1907) from this productive area a further 2\r\nmillion acres must be deducted as non-producing.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of this forest area is most uneven. The bulk and the\r\nmost valuable portion of it is found in the south-eastern corner around\r\nChristiania in eight counties, in which the forest per cent. exceeds 40\r\nto 50, with conifer growth (pine and spruce) up to the 3,000 foot level.\r\nAgain in the three counties around Trondhjem a large and important\r\nforest area is located at the head of the fjords. But the entire western\r\ncoast and the higher elevations are devoid of valuable forest growth and\r\nthe northern third of the country (north of the Arctic circle) is mostly\r\nheath and moors with only 7% wooded, mainly birch growth of little\r\ncommercial value.\r\n\r\nThe commercially important forest area is, therefore, locally confined.\r\nIt is estimated that one-half of the territory has to import its lumber,\r\none-quarter has sufficient for home consumption, and the excess which\r\npermits exportation is confined to the last quarter. This export, mostly\r\nin logs and staves, which amounts to nearly 20 million dollars (40% of\r\nthe total export) half of it woodpulp is estimated to represent only\r\none-fifth or one-sixth of the total cut, which is stated as about 350\r\nmillion cubic feet, or at the rate of 23 cubic feet on the productive\r\narea while the annual growth is estimated at less than this amount,\r\nnamely at the rate of nearly 21 cubic feet in the southern districts,\r\nand in the northern not over 12 cubic feet.\r\n\r\nScotch Pine is the principal timber, and occurs beyond the Arctic\r\nCircle--the northernmost forest in the world--where its rotation becomes\r\n150 to 200 years, with Norway Spruce more or less localized, these two\r\nspecies forming 75 per cent. of the forest growth; oak, ash, basswood\r\nand elm occurring sporadically, and White Birch being ubiquitous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nForest property developed on the same lines as in Sweden and in other\r\nEuropean countries, hence we find State, communal, and private property.\r\n\r\nWhen in the ninth century, upon Harold’s accession, the commons were\r\ndeclared the property of the king, the rights of user, both to wood and\r\ngrazing, were retained by the _märker_, and the so-called State commons\r\n(_stats-almenninger_) remain to date encumbered by these rights, similar\r\nto conditions in Sweden. From the end of the 17th to the middle of the\r\n19th century it was the policy of the kings to dispose of these commons\r\nwhenever their exchequer was low, and the best of these lands became, by\r\npurchase, property of the districts (_bygdealmenning_), provinces, city\r\nand village corporations, or else became private property on which the\r\nrights of user continued (_privatalmenninger_).\r\n\r\nAt present the State owns, largely in the northern districts, somewhat\r\nover 4.8 million acres (28.5%); but of this hardly 2 million acres are\r\nproductive, and of these productive acres half a million consists of\r\nencumbered commons from which the State receives hardly any income. The\r\ndistrict commons or communal, and other public institute forests\r\ncomprise around 7,800,000 acres (46%); but here again only 580,000 acres\r\nare productive. The balance then, or a full one-quarter is in private\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nExport trade in wood had been very early carried on, and had been\r\nconsiderably developed in the 13th and 14th century. By the middle of\r\nthe 17th century the coast forest of oak had been cut out by Dutch and\r\nEnglish wood merchants who had obtained logging privileges under special\r\ntreaties of 1217 and 1308, and by Hanseatic cities, especially Hamburg\r\nentering this market in the middle of the 16th century.\r\n\r\nThere are records which would make it appear that at least some of the\r\nnow denuded coast was forested in olden times. The development of the\r\niron industry increased the drain on these supplies, which forest fires,\r\ninsects and excessive grazing prevented from recuperating.\r\n\r\nAs early as the middle of the 16th century we find attempts to arrest\r\nthe devastation by regulating the export trade and supervising the\r\nsawmills, forbidding especially the erection of sawmills intended to\r\nwork for export only.\r\n\r\nIn the 17th century, various commissions were appointed by Christian IV\r\nto make forest reconnaissances and elaborate rules for proper forest\r\nuse. In 1683, Christian V issued a forest ordinance increasing the\r\nnumber of forest inspectors instituted by his predecessor, and giving in\r\ndetail the rules governing forest use, many of which proved impractical.\r\n\r\nIn 1725, a commission, the socalled forest and sawmill commission, was\r\nappointed to organize a forest service. It functioned until 1739, when\r\nthe first _Generalforstamt_ was established and the first attempt at\r\nreal forest management was made. This came into existence through the\r\nefforts of two famous German foresters, J. G. von Langen and von\r\nZanthier, who with six assistants were called in from the Harz mountains\r\n(as also afterwards to Denmark and Sweden), during the years 1736 to\r\n1740, to make a forest survey and organize a management. Descriptions\r\nand instructions were elaborated in German and the service was largely\r\nmanned by German “wood foresters” (_holzforsterne_). The strictness of\r\nthe department which had been organized after von Langen’s departure in\r\n1739, made it, however, unpopular, and, in 1746, it was abolished, von\r\nZanthier returning to his country, the sole survivor, the other\r\nassistants having succumbed to scurvy. The administration was again\r\nplaced in the hands of a commission which continued till 1760.\r\n\r\nOnly the forests connected with mines remained under the administration\r\nas instituted, and those belonging to the copperworks of Roras continued\r\nunder its forest inspectors until 1901.\r\n\r\nIn that year, 1760, another shortlived attempt to organize a forest\r\nadministration was made, but the new organization did not fare any\r\nbetter and was superseded in 1771. Then followed an interim regimen,\r\nduring which the general government and district officers were in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nThe old orders under which forest use had been regulated remained mostly\r\nin force until in 1795 all the reasonable and the unreasonable\r\nobstructions to export were removed. The sawmill privileges, under which\r\nEnglish lumbermen held large areas for long terms and devastated them\r\nwithout regard to the impractical regulations, were, however, not ended\r\nuntil 1860. The wood industries were then relieved entirely from\r\nrestrictions, and forest destruction progressed even more rapidly with\r\nthe increasing facilities for transportation.\r\n\r\nThis final cessation of the destructive policy was the outcome of a\r\ncampaign which started once more with a forest commission instituted, in\r\n1849, to take stock and make new propositions. This commission reported\r\nin 1850, and pointed out not only the necessity of terminating the\r\nsawmill privileges, which was done in 1854, giving time till 1860, but\r\nalso very wisely accentuated the need of technically educated foresters\r\nif anything for forest recuperation was to be done.\r\n\r\nTo meet this latter want, young men were sent to Germany at government\r\nexpense to study forestry. Some 10 or 12 men were educated in this way\r\nduring the next decade and thereby the basis for a technical forest\r\nmanagement was laid. In 1857, the first two professional foresters,\r\nMejdell and Barth, were placed in charge of affairs under the Interior\r\nDepartment, and when in 1859 a new commission was charged with\r\norganizing a forest service, these two men were members. Gradually an\r\norganization took shape under the direction of these two\r\n_forestmeisters_, and, finally, in 1863, the modern forest department\r\nand forest policy was established by law, placing the State domain and\r\nother public forests under an effective management, making provision for\r\nthe extinction of the ruinous rights of user and also for reducing the\r\nmismanagement of private forests.\r\n\r\nThe forest service, as now constituted after a reorganization in 1906,\r\nis in the Department of Agriculture under a director (_Skovdirector_)\r\nand 4 _Forstmeister_ or inspectors with some executive officers under\r\nvarious names, and 360 rangers (_skogsvogternes_), including the rangers\r\nemployed in the public forests outside the State domain. The ranges are\r\nso large, sometimes several million acres, and many of them so\r\ninaccessible that only the most extensive management is possible; the\r\nofficials being poorly paid and poorly educated, the management is, of\r\ncourse, not of a high order.\r\n\r\nBesides a “forest engineer,” who is a public lecturer, the officers of\r\nthe forest department are under the obligation of advising private\r\nforest owners in their management, under contracts somewhat similar to\r\nthe present practice of the U. S. Forestry Bureau, the owners agreeing\r\nto follow the advice.\r\n\r\nSince 1860, the State has begun to purchase forest lands for\r\nreforestation in the forestless districts and where, for protective\r\nreasons, it is desirable. In late years, regular appropriations of\r\n$15,000 to $20,000 were annually made for this purpose, besides\r\nextraordinary grants. In this way, the cut-over lands, neglected by\r\ntheir owners, are cheaply acquired by the State. Besides its own\r\nplanting, the State assists private owners by advice and money grants\r\nand plantmaterial in reforesting their waste lands.\r\n\r\nThe communal forests are under government supervision; they are usually\r\nworked under plans and under supervision of foresters with a view to\r\nsupply the needs of the community. Only when the area is more than\r\nsufficient may they obtain the right to cut for sale outside of their\r\nparish; on the other hand all fellings may be prohibited by the\r\ngovernment, if this is found desirable. As regards private property\r\nthere seems to be little or no supervision, although the law of 1863 had\r\ndeclared _Kulturplight_ and _Kulturtvank_, i.e., the duty of\r\nreforesting, but it had not defined that duty, and the law remained a\r\ndead letter.\r\n\r\nIn 1874, a special commission was charged to consider the forest policy\r\nwhich the public welfare required. The commission reported in 1879 with\r\npropositions, which were submitted to the officials of the department\r\nand the district. A new proposition was worked out and submitted in\r\n1882, but it was pigeonholed until 1891, when the forest administration\r\nbrought in not a general law but one merely forbidding the export from\r\nNordland, Tromsoe and Finmarken, the thinly forested northern provinces.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1893, legislation was had enabling municipalities to protect\r\nthemselves against destruction of forests needed for their protective\r\nfunction. This gives to them the right to formulate rules which are to\r\nprevent devastation, as for instance a diameter limit for felling, or\r\nreforestation of clearings. But the costs of such restriction must be\r\nborne by the municipalities as well as half the cost of inspection, the\r\nother half being paid by the State. The procedure to determine the\r\nprotective quality of forests and the financial difficulty have left the\r\nlaw unused.\r\n\r\nIn 1878, however, a committee of private owners formed itself, to fix\r\nthe sand dunes, which with the State subventions started work the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany of the State forests are so burdened with rights of user, which\r\nwere granted to help in developing the country, that the financial\r\nresults of the forest administration and the conditions of the State\r\nproperty are most unsatisfactory, and the application of silviculture\r\ngreatly circumscribed.\r\n\r\nThe silvicultural system applied is most generally the rough selection\r\nforest or an approach to group system, relying upon voluntary\r\nreproduction entirely. Management is much hampered by rights of user to\r\ncertain dimensions, and in the more distant districts by the difficulty\r\nof disposing of any but the best sizes. An orderly organization is still\r\nalmost unknown. The stumpage is sold and removed by the buyer and the\r\naxe is still mainly used.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHigher forest schools there are none, but three schools for the lower\r\ngrades had existed for some time, the first having been established in\r\n1875 at Kongsberg; one of them was abandoned in 1889. Forestry is also\r\ntaught at two farm schools.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the higher class foresters had to get their education in\r\nGermany, or in the Swedish Forest Institute at Stockholm; but in 1879,\r\na chair of forestry was instituted in the Agricultural college at\r\nKristiania.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, the first forestry association was formed, which by 1898 had\r\nover 500 members, and then was re-organized with a special view to\r\nelevate private forestry practice. It has now (1907) 1,500 members, and\r\nemploys a forester paid by the State, to give professional advice, and\r\nworks with State aid. It has set out over 50 million trees besides\r\nsowing 8,000 lbs. of seed. It publishes a journal _Tidskrift for\r\nSkogsbruk_, and a Yearbook. There is also another journal, _Forstligt\r\nTidskrift_, and a professional Society of Foresters.\r\n\r\nAltogether forestry is not yet on a high level in this country, but the\r\nsubject is now being brought even into the primary schools, and the\r\nefforts to improve conditions are widespread.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENMARK.\r\n\r\nForestry in Denmark is of interest especially on account of the\r\nintensive methods developed on small areas, and of the efforts at\r\nreforestation of sand dunes, moors and heaths.\r\n\r\nGreatly curtailed in area when, as a result of the war of 1864, Prussia\r\ndetached the provinces of Schleswig and Holstein, Denmark now has an\r\narea of 15,360 square miles with 2.5 million people (or 163 to the\r\nsquare mile). It is largely a farming country, 80 per cent. being\r\nproductive, only 6.3 per cent. of it, or less than 600,000 acres being\r\nunder forest, and this also mostly on soil capable of farm use; hence an\r\nimport of over 7 million dollars worth of wood material is required.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are about 75,000 acres of heaths and other wastes in\r\nprocess of reforestation. Especially on the island of Själland, on which\r\nthe capital Copenhagen, is situated, the forest area is now increasing\r\nby planting. The balance, or nearly 20 per cent. of the land area,\r\nconsists of heaths, moors, peatbogs and sands.\r\n\r\nHalf the forest area is located on the islands, and as these represent\r\nabout one-third of the total area, they are twice as densely forested as\r\nthe peninsula of Jütland. This latter along the north and west coast for\r\n200 miles represents a large sandbank with extensive sand dunes,\r\nshifting sands, heaths and moors, a desolate almost uninhabited country\r\nof sterile downs, called Klitten, the recovery of which has been in\r\nprogress for a hundred years. According to some, this once bore a\r\nconiferous forest, more likely it was never forested.\r\n\r\nWhile originally beech was and is still the predominant timber (60%)\r\nwith considerable additions of oak (7%) and other hardwoods, a conifer\r\nforest of spruce and pine, covering more than 20% of the forest area,\r\nhas been established by planting. This planting has been mainly done on\r\nthe dunes and sandwastes, and in the reclamation of the extensive heaths\r\nand moors or peat bogs, especially in the northern Limfjord district,\r\nwhich occupy one-sixth of the unproductive area.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs was natural, the forest stocking on good farm land had to yield\r\nearly to plow and pasture. Attempts at conservative use of the forest\r\narea date back to 1557 when Christian III issued a forest ordinance\r\ndirecting his vassals or liege lords to permit the peasants to secure\r\ntheir domestic wood requirements at a cheap rate, but not to permit\r\ncutting for sale or export, and reserving to himself all returns from\r\nsuch sales. There were also regulations for the pasture, especially as\r\nto goats, and for the use of the mast, which then formed more than\r\none-quarter of the income from the royal forests.\r\n\r\nIn the 18th century the need of forest management was recognized, and in\r\n1762 the two eminent German foresters, von Langen and von Zanthier (see\r\np. 88) were invited to visit Denmark and Norway (see above) with a view\r\nof organizing such management. In 1760, eight young Danes were sent to\r\nvon Langen in Wernigerode to study his methods for three years, and\r\nthese with the two German foresters returned in 1762, and under the\r\ndirection of von Langen organized the Seeland forest areas and started\r\nthe first plantations of conifers, which are now the pride of Danish\r\nforesters.\r\n\r\nIn 1781, the State forests were altogether placed under an organized\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the 19th century the reduction of forest areas had\r\nprogressed to such an extent that, in 1805, a law was enacted providing\r\nthat the then existing forest area containing beech and oak should be\r\nmaintained as such forever, or at least that for any new clearing an\r\nequivalent area be planted to forest. This law was perhaps the result of\r\na journey in 1802, to Germany made by two leading officials of the\r\nforest department, German influence through Cotta and Hartig being at\r\nthis time visible everywhere.\r\n\r\nOther restrictions in the disposal of peasants’ farms or woodlands and\r\nin the manner of farming the large estates (otherwise than by renting to\r\nfarmers), were also enacted in order to secure stability of the peasant\r\nclass. It was at this time that the accumulative taxing of landed\r\nestates now under heated discussion in Great Britain, was used\r\neffectively to break up the aggregation of landed property and changed\r\nthe country from one of baronial estates to small farmer’s holdings. In\r\nthis reform movement the name of Count _Reventlow_, Chief of the State\r\nforest department, appears as the leading spirit.\r\n\r\nThe forest area, which until 1820 was on the decrease, has since that\r\ntime increased steadily, and is especially now increasing through\r\nreforestation of waste lands.\r\n\r\nAt present, most intensive forest management is practised in the State\r\nforest as well as in the communal and private forest areas, which latter\r\nas stated, are largely in farmers’ wood lots since the law forbids the\r\nunion of small farms into large estates. There is little communal\r\nproperty, and large private estates are also rare. The State owns about\r\n24% of the forest area or 142,000 acres, of which one third is\r\nnonproductive or otherwise occupied, and one third consists of\r\nconiferous plantations. Excepting in the beech forest, most of the\r\ntimber is of the younger age classes, below 60 to 80 years, and it is\r\nanticipated that the cut will have to be reduced, and the import of\r\nwood and woodenware increased.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArtificial reproduction is the most general silvicultural practice\r\nexcept in the beech forest which is reproduced naturally after\r\npreparation of the soil and sowing acorns for admixture at the same\r\ntime, spending altogether $12 to $15 per acre in this preparation. Since\r\n1880, thinnings have been based on the idea of favoring final harvest\r\ntrees somewhat after the French fashion; they are begun in the twentieth\r\nto thirtieth year and are repeated every three years, aided by pruning.\r\nThen in each subsequent decade the return occurs in as many years as the\r\ndecade has tens. Especially in the direction of thinnings, the German\r\npractice and even theory is outdone, the thinnings being made severer\r\nand recurring more frequently.\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred years ago the State began the reclamation work of\r\nthe dunes and heaths, but it progressed more actively only since the\r\nsixties of last century as a result of legislation had in 1857. In 1867,\r\na special Dune Department was instituted, and through the effort of a\r\nState engineer, Capt. _Dalgas_, an association was formed for the\r\nreclamation of heaths and moors. A small subvention of $600 started the\r\nwork of the association, in its useful campaign under the advice of\r\nStaats planteur (State forest planter) _Jensen Tusch_. The State\r\nsubvention now amounts to about forty thousand dollars annually, and the\r\nsuccess of the association has been such that it has become almost a fad\r\nfor large land owners and others to buy up these waste lands and have\r\nthem planted through the agents of the Heath Association. The planting\r\nis mainly of spruce in plow furrows at a cost of $10 to $12 per acre; 60\r\nto 80 year old stands of earlier plantings testifying to the possible\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIn the last 40 years nearly 200,000 acres of heath have been planted, of\r\nwhich over one-half are to the credit of the association.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the education of the higher grade foresters a department of forestry\r\n(now with two professors) was instituted in the Royal Veterinary and\r\nAgricultural High School at Copenhagen in 1869, with a course of five\r\nyears including one and a half year of practical work. This education is\r\ngiven free of charge.\r\n\r\nThe Heath Association educates its own officers, including in their\r\nsubjects the management of meadows and peatbogs.\r\n\r\nA Forestry Association, composed one-half of forest owners, with its\r\norgan _Tidskrift for Skovvaesen_, in existence since 1888, and a\r\nvaluable book literature, in which the problems of the heath are\r\nespecially fully and authoritatively treated, places Denmark in the\r\nforemost rank in the forestry world in these particulars.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent contributors are to be mentioned, besides Reventlow\r\nand Dalgas, _P. E. Müller_, well known by his discussions of the\r\nproblems of moor soils. From 1876 to 1891, he issued a magazine, in\r\nwhich _Oppermann_ contributed a history of Danish forestry. The latter\r\nauthor also, in co-operation with _Hauch_, published in 1900 a Hand-book\r\nof Forestry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEDITERRANEAN PENINSULAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeographically, and to some extent climatically, the three peninsulas of\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea, the Iberian, Italian, and the Balkan, are\r\nsituated alike. Their people, if not in race, are in temper and\r\ncharacteristics, and in their political economy more or less alike. They\r\nrepresent the oldest civilization in Europe, and in their long history\r\nhave been frequently in collision with each other. Their forests,\r\nthrough centuries of abuse, are wherever accessible, in poorest\r\ncondition. Long-continued political disturbances, which have prevented\r\npeaceful development, and poverty, have been the greatest hindrances to\r\neconomic reforms like the recuperation of forests, which require\r\nsacrifices. Ancient rights of user, and the necessity of politicians to\r\nrespect them are also responsible for the fact that, while praiseworthy\r\nattempts in legislation have been made, execution has been usually\r\nlagging behind.\r\n\r\nThe accessibility to sea, permitting readily importation, the temperate\r\nclimate, the simple life and abstemiousness of the people, and the lack\r\nof industrial development have made the deficiency of wood material less\r\nfelt than it would otherwise be, but the detrimental influence of forest\r\ndestruction is being repeatedly experienced in floods and drouths.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no more potent cause of forest devastation in all\r\nthis section of the world than the pasturing of the woods, especially\r\nwith sheep and goats.\r\n\r\nWhile Italy is now a united country, and only two peoples, Spain and\r\nPortugal, occupy the Iberian peninsula, the Balkan peninsula is occupied\r\nby eight separate peoples, if we include all the country south of the\r\nDanube River and East of the Carpathian Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKISH AND SLAVISH TERRITORIES.\r\n\r\nThe Turks for centuries warred with, had under vassalage or otherwise\r\ncontrolled, and misruled all the Slavish States, as well as Macedonia\r\nand Greece--a territory of around 170,000 square miles and 16,000,000\r\npeople--until, by the Congress of Berlin (1878), ending the\r\nRusso-Turkish war, these States were recognized as independent kingdoms,\r\nnamely Bulgaria, Servia, Montenegro, Roumelia, and Roumania, while\r\nBosnia-Hercegovina was placed under Austrian administration (see page\r\n155 and 166).\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Roumania, these people are still in the lower\r\nstages of civilization, the countries undeveloped, the forest still\r\nserves largely for the mast and pasturage, probably less than 24 per\r\ncent. of the country being forest covered, mostly with deciduous trees,\r\noak, beech and walnut, etc.\r\n\r\nRoumania alone has systematically taken advantage of her freedom from\r\nTurkish rule in developing a modern civilization, and can also boast the\r\nbeginning of a forestry system.\r\n\r\n_Roumelia_, comprising _Macedonia_, _Albania_ and _Thrace_, the Turkish\r\npossessions in Europe, with 67,000 square miles and 5,000,000 people,\r\ncontain large areas of untouched forest (not less than 5,000,000 acres\r\nin Macedonia alone[10]) with valuable oak and walnut, which have\r\nremained unused owing to their inaccessibility and the undesirability of\r\ndeveloping them under Turkish rule. Where accessible, the forest is\r\nmaltreated or destroyed.\r\n\r\n  [10] Lacretelle, Rapport sur les forêts de la Macédoine, 1893.\r\n\r\n_Bulgaria_, to which, in 1885, East Roumelia was attached, represents\r\nnow 38,000 square miles and over 4,000,000 people, independent under a\r\nGerman prince as king since 1879. The forest area[11] of 7.5 million\r\nacres (30 per cent. of the land area), mostly deciduous (oak, beech,\r\nwalnut, etc.), and largely confined to the mountains, is one-half in\r\ncommunal ownership, one-sixth in private hands, mostly small woodlots,\r\nand one-third State property; but ownership rights are still much in\r\ndoubt, and until 1869 the State forests were freely open to the use of\r\nall, when some sort or regulation of the cut according to the needs of\r\ndifferent communities was attempted. Since within 10 years such rights\r\nof user establish ownership, endless litigation has resulted, until in\r\n1883 a law was enacted ordering the stoppage of rights of user,\r\nsubstituting money payment (10 per cent. of value), and another\r\nrestricting the diameter to which the most valuable export timber,\r\nwalnut, may be cut. Changes in detail were made in 1897, but political\r\nexigencies, absence of an adequate organization, and other undeveloped\r\nconditions have largely prevented enforcement of these laws, and rough\r\nexploitation continues in spite of the nominal State control.\r\n\r\n  [11] _Forstliche Rundschau_, 1903.\r\n\r\nOwing to inaccessibility of many of the agricultural districts to the\r\nwooded mountains, a large import was necessary, but lately export almost\r\nequals the import, and indeed the export of walnut has increased\r\nfourteenfold in a few years. The forest administration is vested in a\r\nbureau under the Minister of Commerce and Agriculture, with a chief, an\r\ninspector general, and two assistant chiefs. When it is stated that in\r\n1905 the entire budget for forestry was $150,000, the inefficiency of\r\nthe service is apparent.\r\n\r\n_Servia_, a kingdom with 19,000 square miles and 2,000,000 people, has\r\nover 42 per cent. (five million acres--according to others only 32%)\r\nstill in untouched forest, with valuable oak and walnut, the forest\r\nbeing mainly used for hograising. Over 36% is State forest, over 43%\r\ncommunal and institutional forest, leaving about 20% in private hands;\r\nbut, just as in Bulgaria, property conditions are still somewhat\r\nunsettled. Like Bulgaria also on account of the uneven distribution of\r\nforest area, lack of transportation and systematic development--a large\r\npart of the population are more cheaply supplied by importation, which\r\namounts to near one million dollars. Curiously enough, by the law of\r\n1891 only the wood cut from State and church forests could be exported\r\nfree of duty. This export duty was abolished in 1904, and the first\r\nattempt was made by the Minister of Agriculture to bring order into the\r\nforest administration by importing German foresters.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1891, with various subsequent additions and changes, placed\r\nprivate forest property located on exposed mountain slopes or on\r\nshifting sands, or on bogsoils under government surveillance, and\r\nrelieved plantations made under direction of the government of taxes for\r\n10 years.\r\n\r\n_Roumania_,[12] with 50,000 square miles and nearly 6,000,000 people,\r\nunder the capable administration of a Hohenzollern prince, King Charles,\r\nwas in Roman times as _Dacia felix_ one of the most prosperous\r\nprovinces, half of it hilly and mountainous, the other half in the rich\r\nalluvial valley of the Danube, now largely deforested. The hill and\r\nmountain country was until the end of the eighteenth century still well\r\nwooded. A rapid depletion then took place by the demands of the Turkish\r\nmarkets, until now not quite 17 per cent. (according to others 18 or 20\r\nper cent.) of the area is forested, and multifarious rights of user,\r\nwhich made commons of the woods, have naturally led to widespread\r\ndevastation in the accessible parts. In 1847, the National Assembly\r\nattempted regulation of the cut and of the rights of user, but with\r\nlittle effect. In 1894, the total area had decreased to less than 5\r\nmillion acres (according to others 6.7 million acres), of which\r\ntwo-fifths is in private hands, two-fifths State property and Royal\r\nforest (formerly, until 1863, in the hands of the monks), the small\r\nbalance belonging to communities and institutes. In the higher\r\nmountains, fir and spruce with some pine and larch form the forest; but\r\nbroadleaf forest, especially oak and beech is the prevailing type\r\noccupying the middle altitudes and the hill country. The private forest\r\nof small owners is being rapidly depleted, only the State forest and\r\nthat of large proprietors being in good condition.\r\n\r\n  [12] _Die forstwirtschaftlichen Verhältnisse Rumaniens_, Von Mihail\r\n  Vasilescu, 1891. _Notice sur les forêts de Roumanie, in Statistica\r\n  pâdurilor Statulin._ 1903.\r\n\r\nIn 1863, when the cloister property was secularized and taken over by\r\nthe state, the rights of user in this property were suspended, and sales\r\nat auction to contractors were inaugurated, under condition that a\r\ncertain number of seed trees per acre be left. There was little\r\nenforcement of this rule.\r\n\r\nThe first comprehensive law organizing the State property and\r\ninaugurating a protective policy was enacted in 1881. This law\r\nrecognized State, Royal and Communal property as of public concern, and\r\nalso placed such private property under supervision as was situated on\r\nsteep slopes, near watercourses, and near the boundaries (of strategic\r\nimportance). These areas, coming under the protective policy, comprise\r\n84 per cent. of the whole forest area. They were not to be cleared\r\nexcept by special permit, and not to be exploited except under specially\r\napproved working plans.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, three French foresters were called in to organize a State\r\nforest department and to inaugurate the making of working plans. The\r\npersonnel (25 inspectors and 89 district officers) being insufficient,\r\nand wood prices low (the income from state property being not over\r\n$400,000), the progress of the work was slow. Although, in 1894, the\r\nincome had doubled, the administrative forces had not been enlarged to\r\nany great extent (137 foresters of various grades), and by that time\r\nonly 150,000 acres had been brought under working plans. By 1900, about\r\n200,000 acres of State property, or 14 per cent., and 500,000 acres of\r\nprivate forest, or 22 per cent., were organized in some fashion. Lack of\r\nmeans of transportation, however, prevents a really well regulated\r\nmanagement. Altogether only 65 per cent. of the State property is\r\naccessible so that it can be worked, and the working plans consist\r\nmainly in leaving a number of seed trees.\r\n\r\nIn 1889, a Forestry Association (_Progressul Silvic_) was formed, which\r\nwith its organ, _Revista pâdurilor_, pushes the propaganda. In 1890, an\r\nenergetic Minister of Domains, Carp, sought strenuously to bring\r\nimprovement into the situation. A budget of $500,000 for foresters’\r\ndwellings was secured to bring the forest managers into closer contact\r\nwith their charges, a planting fund of $100,000, later increased to\r\n$140,000 per annum, was voted, and reforestation and reclamation of sand\r\ndunes was begun. A forest improvement fund was inaugurated in 1892 by\r\nsetting aside 2 per cent. of the gross forest yield. But, in the\r\npolitical struggles, Carp’s party was displaced, and, depression in\r\nagricultural prosperity causing financial distress, an era of increased\r\nexploitation followed, so that the export of forest products, largely\r\ncooperage, (mainly to Greece, Italy and France) which had been declining\r\nto less than half, rose again to about four million dollars annually.\r\nThe financial embarrassment of the State led even to a proposition to\r\nsell State forests, but, before contracts for this purpose were\r\nconsummated, relief came and the danger was averted.\r\n\r\nThe State cuts about 22,000 acres annually, yielding about $1,000,000,\r\nthe administration costing (in 1903) $240,000, leaving a net yield of 30\r\ncents per acre. In 1898, the Forest Department, in the Direction of\r\nDomains under the Ministry of Agriculture consisted of a Forest Director\r\nwith 156 foresters academically educated (mostly in France, and since\r\n1892 in the Agricultural Institute at Bucharest), and over 2,500\r\nunderforesters and guards. Of some 30,000 acres of sand dunes, one-half\r\nbelonging to the State, about 18,000 acres have been recovered by\r\nplanting Black Locust, and some 9,000 acres of plains country have been\r\nreforested, for which 330 acres of nurseries furnish the material. In\r\nspite of all these efforts, excessive pasturing, although forbidden in\r\nthe State forest, and fires continue to devastate the property.\r\n\r\nPrivate forestry is, of course, much less developed; yet some large\r\nproperties (Princess Schoenburg, with 20,000 acres) are under efficient\r\nGerman forest management. Here, money is spent on developing means of\r\ntransportation, and a better revenue is secured than in State forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREECE.\r\n\r\n  DR. CHLOROS, Waldverhältnisse Griechenlands.

For centuries after\r\nGreece had become a Roman province (146 B.C.), it changed rulers,\r\nRomans, Byzantines, Franks, Venetians following each other, until,\r\nbetween 1460 and 1473, it came under the Turkish yoke. As a result of\r\nan insurrection started in 1821, freedom, but no settled order as yet,\r\nwas attained in 1829 through the assistance of Great Britain, France and\r\nRussia, and the elected kings, Otho (of Bavaria), Alfred (of England)\r\nand George (of Denmark) successively tried to secure social order and\r\nefficient constitutional government.\r\n\r\nBy the time this new era had arrived there was probably little valuable\r\nforest worthy of the name left, except in the inaccessible mountain\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Forest Conditions._\r\n\r\nAlthough certain districts, like Attica, were already practically\r\ndenuded in Plato’s time, there is little doubt that originally the whole\r\nof Greece with small exceptions was a continuous forest. The destruction\r\nof the forest, protected by thousands of gods and nymphs in holy groves,\r\nproceeded slowly under the regime of the ancient Greeks, until the\r\nfanaticism of the Christian religion led to a war against these pagan\r\nstrongholds, and the holy groves were reduced by axe and fire. Turkish\r\nmisrule for centuries, over-taxation, reckless cutting, extensive\r\nherding of goats and sheep, and fires have reduced the forest area until\r\nnow it occupies only 12 or 14 per cent. of the land area (25,000 square\r\nmiles). In 1854, a survey developed about 2 million acres of woodlands\r\n(probably an excessive figure) for the now 2.5 million people, while 67\r\nper cent. of the surface is a useless waste, and only 20 per cent. under\r\ncultivation, so that the general aspect of the country is desolate. The\r\nmany islands are entirely deforested, and so are the seashores. “Where\r\nin olden times dense shady poplars stood, now only infertile sand and\r\ndreary rock waste remain.”\r\n\r\nThe forest in northern and middle Greece is confined to the two rugged\r\nmountain ranges with numerous spurs which run parallel, north and south,\r\nwith Mt. Olympus (nearly 9,000 feet) and Mt. Pindus (6,000 feet) the\r\nhighest elevations. The large fertile plains of Thessaly and Boeotia are\r\nforestless. So is the large Arcadian plateau of the Peloponnesus, and\r\nthe other smaller, hot but fertile plains and plateaus. The most\r\nvaluable conifer forest is found on the higher ranges between the 2,500\r\nand 5,000 foot level, below the snow-clad mountain tops, where\r\nespecially two species of fir, _Abies Apollinis_ and _Abies reginæ\r\nAmaliae_ (a species remarkable for its sprouting habit), with other firs\r\nand several species of _Juniperus_ and _Cupressus_, form sometimes\r\nextensive forests. Other common trees are chestnut, sycamore, several\r\nspecies of oak and poplar, and, on the coast, _Pinus halepensis_.\r\n\r\nThe firs occupy about 35 per cent. of the forest area, oaks and\r\ndeciduous forest 45 per cent. Among the forest products which are\r\nexported, we find galls, vermillion and sumach prominent.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that Greece in ancient times was more fertile than it is\r\nnow, and that the deterioration is due to deforestation. Undoubtedly\r\nsoil conditions favored such deterioration, for, with the exception of\r\nthe Pindus range, which is composed of metamorphic rock, a poor, dry\r\nlimestone is characteristic of the country except where fertile,\r\nalluvial and diluvial deposits cover it in valleys along the coast. The\r\nclimate is, however, so favorable that even the poor soil would readily\r\nreclothe itself if left alone. The winters are short, hardly three\r\nmonths, and with hardly any snow or ice except on the high mountains,\r\nmaking the vegetative period nine months; and, with temperature ranges\r\nfrom 20 to 106 degrees F.; rainfall average 400 mm.; the summers, to be\r\nsure, rainless and dry, but the other seasons humid, somewhat less than\r\nin middle Europe, rapid growth is the result of these conditions. But\r\nthe continued pasturing of goats and sheep--some six million--prevents\r\nany natural reforestation. Increased taxation on this industry has had\r\nno effect, and the practice of permitting the people to gather dry wood\r\nfor fuel is an incentive for making dry wood by setting fires, which\r\nalso serve to improve the pasture; perhaps nowhere are forest fires more\r\nfrequent, in spite of heavy penalties. That a baneful influence on the\r\nwater condition and river flow has been the result is historically\r\ndemonstrated by Chloros.[13]\r\n\r\n  [13] See _Allgemeine Forst- und Jagdzeitung 1884_, p. 183 ff., and\r\n  1887, p. 327 ff. for interesting details.\r\n\r\nIn the mountains some fine and quite extensive bodies of fir still\r\nexist, lack of transportation having preserved them. Elsewhere the\r\nrights of user, and the herding of goats are so well established that\r\nreforms appear, indeed, difficult.\r\n\r\nFirewood, 3 loads for each person, supposed to be taken from the dead\r\nor otherwise useless trees, and small dimension material is free to all.\r\nFor the right to cut workwood, the government charges a tax of 25 to 30\r\nper cent. of the value of the material, the price for this being\r\nannually determined. On the material cut in private forests, the\r\ngovernment also levies a tax of from 12 to 18 per cent. of its value.\r\nThis pernicious system of promiscuous cutting leads to the most wasteful\r\nuse imaginable, not only high stumps, but large amounts of good material\r\nare left in the woods so that it is estimated that hardly 50 per cent.\r\nof what is cut is really utilized. The cut, as far as the tax gives a\r\nclue to it, amounts to around 2.7 million cubic feet workwood, but with\r\nthe firewood included it was estimated that near 90 million cubic feet\r\nare cut annually. Importation to the amount of 1.5 million dollars,\r\nmostly from Austria and Roumania, makes up the deficit in work material,\r\nespecially for the box factories which manufacture the packages for the\r\nlarge export of currants, some 2 million boxes. The tax during the\r\ndecade from 1862 to 1871 produced an annual income of $600,000, a little\r\nless in 1895.\r\n\r\nThe forest has been from olden times, and is now almost entirely, State\r\nproperty (some 80 or 90 per cent.) and in nearly all the remaining,\r\nprivate, communal and cloister property the State has a partial\r\nownership or supervision. The waste land of probably 3 million acres\r\nextent also belongs to the State, the whole State property covering over\r\n30 per cent. of the land area.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Development of Forest Policies._\r\n\r\nA first definite attempt to regulate matters was made by Otho, who being\r\na German, took a personal interest in this forest property, and\r\ninstituted for each province forest inspectors (dasarchys) under one\r\nchief inspector, with forest guards, to prevent devastation by fire and\r\ntheft. The mistake was made of employing in these positions\r\nsuperannuated Bavarian army officers, who were merely a burden on the\r\ntreasury. No management or even regular fellings were attempted. The\r\npopulation could, as before, supply its needs upon permits, always\r\ngranted, from the governor of the province, one of the forest guards\r\nbeing supposed to vise these, and to see that the wood was properly\r\nemployed, not, however, to supervise the cutting.\r\n\r\nIn 1877, further legislation was had, instituting in the Ministry of\r\nFinance, a forest inspector, technically trained, with two assistant\r\ninspectors, also technically trained, to superintend the outside work. A\r\nforest survey was begun in 1879, but interrupted in 1880 for lack of\r\nfunds and personnel. The same law placed the duty of guarding the State\r\nproperty in the hands of the general police or gendarmerie, 50 officers\r\nand some 340 guards, and during the fire danger (June to October) 110\r\nmore, being detailed for this service under direction of the Minister of\r\nWar. The pernicious permit system, however, was continued.\r\n\r\nDr. Chloros, who obtained his education in Germany, became finally\r\nForest Director and was responsible for securing further legislation in\r\n1888, the object of which was, as a first step towards improvement, to\r\nsurvey and delimit and round off the State property. It provided that\r\nenclaves, and all absolute forest soil was to be expropriated. If no\r\namicable agreement with the owner could be reached, the price was to be\r\ndetermined by the net yield which had been obtained from the property\r\nduring the last five years, capitalized at 5 per cent. No attempts,\r\nhowever, at an efficient organization or change of the destructive\r\npermit system were made.\r\n\r\nBy general law, the State has the right to surveillance of private\r\nproperty, although the extent of this right is not fully defined. The\r\ngovernment may take for its own use, by paying for it, upwards of\r\none-sixth of the annual cut; it collects a tax of 12 to 18 per cent. for\r\nall woodwork cut; it forbids the pasturing of woods that have been\r\nburned within 10 years, and obliges all owners of over 1200 acres to\r\nemploy forest guards. This and other interference with property rights\r\nnaturally acts as deterrent to private forest management. A notable\r\nexception is the small private royal forest property near Athens, which,\r\nsince 1872 under a Danish forester, appears to have been managed under\r\nforestry principles.\r\n\r\nA thorough re-organization of the forest service was effected in 1893,\r\nwhen 20 district foresters were employed, the number of forest\r\ninspectors was increased to four, and a regular Division of Forestry was\r\ninstituted in the Finance Department. The general police or gendarmerie\r\nwas continued as forest guards. Until a native personnel could be\r\neducated by sending young men to Germany, foreigners were to be\r\nemployed for the making of working plans.\r\n\r\nYet in 1896, the then Director of the Forest Department, a lawyer, still\r\ncomplains of the absence of a proper organization and of any personnel\r\nwith forestry knowledge. Apparently no progress had been made. In that\r\nyear, however, the gendarmerie was to be replaced by forest guards (52\r\nsuperior and 298 subaltern) who were to be appointed from graduates of a\r\nspecial secondary school, which had been instituted at Vytina some two\r\nyears before. This replacement could, of course, not be effected at\r\nonce, since hardly more than 25 men could be graduated annually; hence\r\neven this improvement in the lower class police would not be completed\r\nfor six or eight years. No steps had been taken to educate officers for\r\nthe higher grades, and in this direction, propositions merely were\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nIn 1899, a change in the permit system was made, but hardly for the\r\nbetter, justices of the peace being empowered, under certain conditions,\r\nto issue such permits. Nor do we find in 1901 anything more than\r\nexpressions of good wishes, and desire for further legislation, besides\r\nsome attempts at popular education through the formation of\r\ntree-planting associations under the patronage of the Crown Princess. In\r\n1905 no change in conditions are reported. Forest fires still continue\r\nas a common occurrence.\r\n\r\nWhile the government makes efforts to improve conditions, the\r\nindifference, stupidity, cupidity, and malevolence of the people, and\r\nthe long established abuses prevent rapid progress at reform.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\n  _Bolletino ufficiale per l’amminstrazione forestale Italiana._\r\n\r\n  _Direzione generale dell’ Agricoltora: Relazione interno all’\r\n  amministrazione dei boschi domaniali inalienabili._\r\n\r\n  Various essays by Prof. VITTORIO PERONA of Vallambrosa in German\r\n  magazines; notably in _Allgemeine Forst- und Jagdzeitung_, 1882,\r\n  1888.\r\n\r\n  _Archeologia forestale.

An exceedingly well written popular treatise on silviculture,\r\n  which gives also briefly insight into forest conditions and forest\r\n  practices.\r\n\r\n  _I boschia e la nostra politica Italiana_, by BERTAGNOLLI, 1889.\r\n\r\n  _Italia moderna._ 1904, article by LUNADONI.\r\n\r\nThe efforts to secure improvement in the treatment of forest resources\r\nhave been more active and strenuous in Italy than in Greece. They were\r\ninduced especially by the urgent need of protecting watersheds, the\r\nrivers throughout Italy having been turned into torrents by\r\ndeforestation. But, owing to the weakness of the government and to\r\npoverty, the actual execution of the very good laws has lagged behind.\r\nIndeed, while ample legislation has been enacted, the people,\r\noverburdened with debt, and needing the small income that can be derived\r\nfrom pasturing or renting the pasture in the woods, make it difficult to\r\ncarry on any reform, and the enforcement of the laws has again and again\r\nled to serious trouble. “Forestry is a sore point in the national\r\neconomy of Italy, as it involves sacrifice of money and time.” Italy,\r\ntherefore, is still in the transition period from forestal rapine to\r\nforest culture.\r\n\r\nDensely populated (33 million on 110,600 square miles), with fully\r\none-fifth of its area unproductive, or at least unused, and one-quarter\r\nof this almost or quite beyond redemption, no country offers better\r\nopportunities for studying the evil effects of deforestation on soil and\r\nwaterflow. As a result of the combination of geology (slates and\r\nlimestones), topography (steep slopes), climate, and forest devastation\r\nor destruction, mainly by pasturage of goats (two million), the Italian\r\nrivers are invariably flooded in March and mostly dry in summer; the\r\nmelting of the snow coinciding with the heavy spring rains turns them\r\ninto raging torrents (_fiumare_), silting over the fertile lands in the\r\nvalleys and occasional landslides in the mountain country, where\r\nextensive tracts are nearly bare of vegetation. Especially the rivers\r\naround Bologna, which in 1897 again caused damage in excess of one\r\nmillion dollars, are dreaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Forest Conditions._\r\n\r\nSituated similarly to Greece as regards accessibility and climate, and\r\nsimilarly torn by wars and political strife, and in unstable conditions\r\nfor centuries, Italy has in proportion to population, if not to area,\r\nreduced her forest resources even more than Greece; less than one-third\r\nof an acre per capita remains, with a total of somewhat over twelve\r\nmillion acres, or about 17 per cent. of the land area, and this includes\r\nmuch useless brushland, over 2 million acres. Apparently, if the\r\nuncertain statistics may be relied upon, a reduction of several million\r\nacres has taken place even since 1870. Some 15 million acres of waste\r\nland and swamps offer ample opportunity for increasing this forest area\r\nwithout infringing on the 42 million acres of usefully employed\r\nagricultural soil.\r\n\r\nOf the forest area, 25 per cent. is to be found in the Alps, about 50\r\nper cent. on the Apennines, the one mountain range which forms the\r\nbackbone of Italy; less than one-quarter is distributed over the plains,\r\nand the small balance is found on the islands, especially Sicily, which\r\nis a hill and mountain country, once magnificently wooded, now largely\r\ndenuded (4 per cent. wooded), and on Sardinia, which, with nearly 45 per\r\ncent. under forest, is the best wooded part of Italy, although the\r\ncondition of the forest is here no better than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the slopes of the Alps (2.5 million acres of\r\nspruce, fir, beech, larch), and the tops of the Apennines and remote\r\nplateaus (4.5 million acres), and of a few special places on which now\r\nand then even magnificent remnants of virgin forest may be found--lack\r\nof transportation having preserved them--most of the area is occupied by\r\nmiserable brush forest, coppice or else open forest with scattered trees\r\namong a shrub undergrowth of thorns, hazel and chestnut (called macchia,\r\ni.e., chaparral), so that most Italians have never seen a real forest.\r\nNevertheless, Italy is by no means as treeless as this condition of\r\nforest would imply, for trees (poplar, ash, elm) are dotting the plains\r\nand slopes, planted for vine supports and boundaries, unshapely through\r\npollarding and lopping the branches for firewood. Olive and chestnut\r\ngroves on the hills (of the former 2 million acres, of the latter over\r\n400,000 acres planted for the fruit), and 8.5 million acres in vineyards\r\nadd to the wooded appearance of the country and to the wood supply. The\r\nannual product of firewood from these planted trees is estimated at 6\r\nmillion cords.\r\n\r\nOn the sand dunes and near the seashore, especially in the marshes, the\r\nMaritime, the Aleppo Pine, and the umbrella-shaped _Pinus pinea_, and\r\npicturesque Cypresses are sometimes found in small groves, while the\r\ncalcareous hills in this region up to 1200 feet are studded with olives,\r\ncork and evergreen oak. Osier growing is here also quite extensively\r\npracticed. In the mountains, above the 2700 foot level, conifer forest,\r\ncomposed of _Pinus silvestris_ and _laricio_, and _Abies pectinata_, has\r\nbeen reduced to less than 7 per cent. of the whole, mixed conifer and\r\ndeciduous forest represents 4 per cent., the bulk being deciduous forest\r\nof oak (several species) and beech, with chestnut. Forty-eight per cent.\r\nof the forest area is in coppice (_ceduo_), and of the 52 per cent. of\r\nhigh forest, the bulk is managed under selection system (_a scelta_), a\r\nsmall part under clearing system (_ad alto fusto_), although management\r\ncan hardly be said to exist except in small groves.\r\n\r\nThat supply of workwood is insufficient for the needs of the population,\r\nand is decreasing, is attested by the fact that the importations more\r\nthan doubled in the decade from 1892 to 1903 to near 14 million dollars,\r\n80 per cent. of which was saw material, in addition to 2 million dollars\r\nof wood manufactures, while nearly 5 million dollars’ worth was exported\r\nin the last named year, mostly cork, casks, thin box-boards, olive wood\r\nmanufactures, and charcoal. No better picture of the forest conditions\r\ncan be had than by a statement of the home production, which, in 1886,\r\n(last official data) was placed at 48 million cubic feet of workwood,\r\nvalued at 3.4 million dollars, 223 million cubic feet firewood, valued\r\nat 4.1 million, 106 million cubic feet charcoal, worth 3.6 million, and\r\nby-products to the large amount of 6.4 million dollars, altogether a\r\nlittle less than 17.6 million dollars. Firewood and charcoal, which\r\nrepresent over 80 per cent. of the product, are, of course, furnished by\r\ncoppice, and in addition by the pollarded material, almost the only fuel\r\nto be had.\r\n\r\nThe ownership of the forest area is for the greater part private (53 per\r\ncent.) and communal (over 43 per cent.), the State owning a little over\r\n400,000 acres, less than 4 per cent. The State property being so small,\r\nsupervision of communal and private forest has become the policy.\r\n\r\nThe State forest is of two classes, the alienable, under the Department\r\nof Finance, the larger part, about 375,000 acres, and the inalienable,\r\nso declared by law of 1871, which was then about 115,000 acres, and was\r\nplaced under a forest administration in the Department of Agriculture;\r\nbut of this about 20 per cent. is not forest, and even in 1896, some of\r\nthis small area was sold so that now only 40,000 acres remain. This area\r\nis to serve for demonstration of model management, and to supply\r\ngovernment needs. Beech and oak with fir, pine and larch, mostly in\r\ntimber forest, characterize this property, which is managed mostly in\r\nselection system. Curiously enough, in 1888, the difficulty of disposing\r\nadvantageously of the old timber is complained of, due to lack of means\r\nof transportation. The personnel of the administration consists of a\r\ncentral bureau with one Inspector General, three Inspectors, and a\r\nCouncil. For each province, and in some cases for two or more provinces\r\ntogether, an Inspector with several Sub-inspectors and a number of\r\nguards or _brigadieri_ are charged with the management of the State\r\nproperty and the enforcement of the forest laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Development of Forest Policy._\r\n\r\nFor centuries, since the fall of the Roman Empire (476 A.D.) until the\r\nend of the eighteenth century, Italy has been the victim of war and\r\nstrife with neighbors or within its borders, being divided into\r\nnumberless commonwealths, almost each city being independent. Hence, no\r\neconomic improvements could take place until, under the influences of\r\nthe French Revolution, the regeneration period began. Not, however,\r\nuntil the seven or eight states, which the Congress of Vienna (1815) had\r\nestablished, were moulded into one united Italy under Victor Emmanuel,\r\nduring the years 1859 to 1870, could an effective reconstruction be\r\ninaugurated.\r\n\r\nIt is true that some of the republics in earlier times paid attention to\r\ntheir forest property. Notably in Venice, old forest ordinances[14] date\r\nback to 697, and, in 1453, a regular forest administration was\r\ninstituted, especially to take care of the large forest area in Istria\r\nand Dalmatia, which fell into the hands of the Venetians about 1420. A\r\ntolerably conservative management continued here until the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century when, in consequence of political complications,\r\nsupervision became lax, and devastation began which continued through\r\nthe century, leaving to the new century, and finally to the Austrians,\r\nthe legacy of the Karst (see p. 173).\r\n\r\n  [14] BERENGER, Saggio storico della legislacione Veneta forestale,\r\n  1863. An excellent source.\r\n\r\nFlorence too, managed to prevent the deforestation of the summit of her\r\nmountains until the beginning of the eighteenth century, and in other\r\nrepublics, kingdoms and duchies, similar efforts at forest\r\nadministration existed. Yet Genoa, which in Strabo’s time was the\r\nprincipal timber market of Italy, had by 1860 nearly all its mountain\r\nslopes denuded.\r\n\r\nBefore the general legislation for all Italy was enacted there were at\r\nleast a dozen laws in operation in the various provinces; in Lombardy,\r\nthe law of 1811; in Naples, the law of 1826; in Rome, of 1827; in\r\nUmbria, of 1805; in Bologna, of 1829; in Tuscany, of 1829; in Piedmont,\r\nof 1833; in Sardinia, of 1851; etc. If these had been heeded much better\r\nconditions would have been inherited by the new kingdom.\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of a national spirit, many schemes for the promotion of\r\nforestry and of forest policy were discussed. The academies of Florence,\r\nMilan, Modena, Palermo, and Pesaro offered premiums for reforesting of\r\nmountains, and called for popular treatises on silviculture. A forestry\r\njournal came into being, furthering the propaganda. In 1860 a very well\r\nwritten account of “Present Conditions of Forestry and Production of\r\nSulphur in Sicily,” a collection of reports, was published by Shiro. In\r\n1860 also, an investigation of forest conditions in each province was\r\nordered by royal decree, and propositions for their improvement were\r\ncalled for, which led to legislative proposals, introduced in 1862, and\r\nlegislation enacted in 1863.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1863 still treated each province independently: forest\r\ninspectors for each province, and for Naples an Inspector General, with\r\ndistrict foresters and a large number of forest guards were appointed.\r\n\r\nAnother law, applicable only to certain parts of the Kingdom, was\r\nenacted in 1874, intended to check the progress of deforestation and\r\nprevent turning waste woodlands into pasture; these absolute forest\r\nsoils were to be reforested within five years. The law remained a dead\r\nletter, yet it is still in force in part, with modifications enacted in\r\n1886.\r\n\r\nThe final unification of the country as far as legislative unity is\r\nconcerned, was completed in 1877, and in that year the first general\r\nforest law for all Italy was also enacted.\r\n\r\nThis law, which has mainly in view the protective influence of forest\r\ncover as a factor in the public welfare, leaving all private property\r\nnot falling under the character of protection forest entirely free,\r\nestablished provincial forest commissions--conservation boards--unpaid,\r\nwho were to enact rules and regulations best adapted to their\r\nlocalities. The Board of Commissioners consisted of the prefect of the\r\nprovince, _ex-officio_ president; an inspector of forests, the technical\r\nofficer who administers the government property; an engineer appointed\r\nby the governor; and three members chosen by the provincial council; in\r\naddition, each communal council was to send one member to take part in\r\nthe deliberations of the board as far as his particular commune was\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nBy this law the country is divided into two sections vertically, namely\r\nthe territory above the limit of chestnut, and that below this limit,\r\nthe latter representing the farming country, the territory above being\r\nunfit for agricultural use. To the former the restrictions of the law\r\napply as a rule (_terreni soggetti al vincolo forestale_--ban forest),\r\nto the latter, as exception, namely where the removal of forest or brush\r\ncover might cause landslides, or affect stream flow or health conditions\r\nunfavorably. The chestnut limit naturally varies in different parts,\r\nbut, generally speaking, lies between 1,800 and 2,000 feet elevation.\r\nThe determination of these areas was to be made by the provincial forest\r\ncommittees, and it is significant to note that in these the State forest\r\nadministration did not have the majority.\r\n\r\nThe territory under restriction, was in 1887, after various revisions,\r\nestablished as comprising 7.5 million acres of forest and 2.5 million\r\nacres of brush and waste, nearly 71% of the forest area being thus\r\nplaced under restriction; leaving 2.5 million acres of forest and over 2\r\nmillion of brush and waste outside the working of the law; these latter\r\nareas are left entirely without restrictions, except as general police\r\nregulations apply. The execution of the law and regulations is left to\r\nthe State Forest Department with an organization of forest guards (some\r\n3,000 in 1883), appointed by the prefect of the province with the advice\r\nof the forestry commission, but acting under the State forest\r\nadministration. Their pay was to come to the extent of two-thirds from\r\nthe communes, the other third from the provincial treasurer.\r\n\r\nIn the forests placed under the law, clearing and agricultural use is\r\nforbidden. Fellings and cultures must be made under direction of the\r\nCommittee. No compensation is made for this limitation in use except\r\nwhere hygienic influence was the basis for placing the forest under ban.\r\n\r\nIf the regulations of the commissions had been observed to their full\r\nextent, all would have been well in time, but it is evident from\r\nsubsequent legislative efforts that the execution of the laws was not\r\nwhat could be desired. Political exigencies required leniency in the\r\napplication of the law. An interesting report on the results of the\r\nfirst quinquennium shows that during that time 170,000 acres were\r\ncleared, over 40,000 without permission, and by 1900, it was estimated,\r\ndeforestation had taken place on about 5 million acres.\r\n\r\nWrangling over the classification of the lands under ban has continued\r\nuntil the present, and local authorities have continued to favor private\r\nas against public interest, to withdraw lands from the operation, and to\r\nwink at disregard of the law. Moreover, rights of user to dead wood,\r\npasturage (goats are by law excluded) and other privileges continued to\r\nprevent improvement, although several laws to effect their extinction\r\nhad been passed.\r\n\r\nThe devastating floods of 1882 led to much agitation, and, upon a report\r\nof a special commission in 1886, the law of 1874, which had obligated\r\nthe communities to reforest their waste lands within five years or else\r\nto sell, was revived, extending the term of obligatory reforestation in\r\nthe endangered sections to ten years. By that time, out of 800,000 acres\r\noriginally declared as requiring reforestation, not more than 40,000\r\nacres had been planted, but the acreage involved had also been gradually\r\nscaled down by the forest committees to 240,000 acres. The report, on\r\nthe other hand, found that the area needing reboisement was at least\r\n500,000 acres, requiring an expenditure of 12 million dollars. The law\r\nof 1877 did not contemplate enforced reforestation of banforests; it\r\nsought to accomplish this by empowering either the Department of\r\nAgriculture or the provinces or the communities or special associations\r\nto expropriate for the purpose of reforestation. Results were nil.\r\n\r\nA revision and broadening of the law led to the general reboisement act\r\nof 1888,[15] which has in view the correction of torrents, fixing of\r\nmountain slopes and sand dunes--one of the best laws of its kind in\r\nexistence anywhere.\r\n\r\n  [15] For details see _Fernow_, in Garden and Forest, 1888, page 417.\r\n\r\nThe principal features of the law are: obligatory reboisement of\r\nmountains and sand dunes according to plans, and under direction of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, the areas to be designated by the department,\r\nwith approval or disapproval of the forest committees; contribution to\r\nthe extent of two-fifths (finally raised to two-thirds) of the expense\r\nby the government; expropriation where owners do not consent, or fail to\r\ncarry out the work as planned; right to reclaim property by payment of\r\ncosts and interest, or else sale by government; right of the department\r\nto regulate and restrict pasture, but compensation to be paid to\r\nrestricted owners; encouragement of co-operative planters’ associations.\r\nThe area to be reforested was estimated at somewhat over 500,000 acres\r\nand the expense at over 7 million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the law was not any stricter than before. In 1900, the\r\nSecretary of Agriculture reports that “the laws do not yet receive\r\neffective application.” The difficulty of determining what is and what\r\nis not necessary to reforest, what is and what is not absolute forest\r\nsoil made ostensibly the greatest trouble and occasioned delay, but\r\nfinancial incapacity and political influences bidding for popularity are\r\nprobably the main cause of the inefficiency.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the forest department tried to promote reforestation by giving\r\npremiums from its scanty appropriation and distributing from its 130\r\nacres of nurseries, during the years from 1867 to 1899, some 46 million\r\nplants and over 500 pounds of seed, and furnishing advice free of\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, again a commission was instituted to formulate new legislation.\r\nThis commission reported in 1902, declaring that all accessible forests\r\nwere more or less devastated, accentuating the needs of water\r\nmanagement, and proposing a more rigorous definition of ban forests, a\r\nstrict supervision of communal forests, and the management of private\r\nproperties under working plans by accredited foresters or else under\r\ndirect control of the forest department, the foresters to be paid by the\r\nState, which is to recover from the owners. It was found that in the\r\npast 35 years of the 125,000 acres needing reforestation urgently only\r\n58,300 acres had been planted at an expense of $1,340,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, conditions seem not to have much improved, for again a vigorous\r\nattempt at re-organization and improvement on the law of 1877 was made\r\nby the Minister of Agriculture; so far without result.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that Italy is perhaps the only country where forest\r\ninfluence on health conditions was legally recognized, by the laws of\r\n1877 and 1888. The belief that deforestation of the _maremnae_, the\r\nmarshy lowlands between Pisa and Naples, had produced the malarial fever\r\nwhich is rampant here, led the Trappist monks of the cloister at Tre\r\nFontane to make plantations of Eucalyptus (84,000) beginning in 1870,\r\nthe State assisting by cessions of land for the purpose. A commission,\r\nappointed to investigate the results, in 1881, threw doubt on the\r\neffectiveness of the plantation, finding the observed change in health\r\nconditions due to improvement of drainage; and lately, the mosquito has\r\nbeen recognized as the main agency in propagating the fever. The new\r\npropositions, however, did not any more recognize this claimed influence\r\nas a reason for public intervention. Incidentally it may be stated that\r\nto two Italians is due the credit of having found the true cause of\r\nsalubriousness of forest air, namely in the absence of pathogenic\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Education and Literature._\r\n\r\nThe first forest school was organized by Balestrieri, who had studied in\r\nGermany, at the Agricultural School near Turin about 1848, transferred\r\nto the Technical Institute in Turin in 1851. This school continued until\r\n1869, and from 1863 on, had been recognized by the State, assuring its\r\ngraduates employment in State service. In 1869, the State established a\r\nforest school of its own (_Institute Forestale_) at Vallambrosa near\r\nFlorence, with a three years’ course (since 1886, four years) and, in\r\n1900, with eleven professors and 40 students. In spite of the State\r\nsubvention of $8,500, it appears that some peculiar economies are\r\nnecessary, for owing to the absence of stoves the school is closed from\r\nNov. 1 to March 1. In spite of the existence of this school, the State\r\nService is recruited also from men who have not passed through this\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe legislative propositions brought forward in 1910 also provide for\r\ntransfer of this school to Florence, leaving only the experiment station\r\nin Vallambrosa, and also for raising the standard of instruction. At the\r\nsame time, however, there was at the old institution ordered a “rush\r\ncourse” to be finished in 15 months, since it appeared that not enough\r\nforesters were in existence to carry out the proposed re-organization.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, a school of silviculture for forest guards was instituted in\r\nCittaducale, the course being 9 months.\r\n\r\nBesides the technical school at Vallambrosa, agricultural schools have\r\nchairs of forestry or arboriculture, as for instance the Royal school at\r\nPortici. As an educational feature, the introduction of Arbor Day, in\r\n1902, _la festa dei alberi_, should also be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a forest school naturally produces a literature. While\r\na considerable number of popular booklets attempt the education of the\r\npeople, who are the owners of the forest, there is no absence of\r\nprofessional works. Among these should be mentioned Di Berenger’s\r\n_Selvicoltura_, a very complete work, which also contains a brief\r\nhistory of forestry in the Orient, Greece and Italy. G. Carlos Siemoni’s\r\n_Manuele d’arte forestale_ (1864), and the earlier _Scienza selvana_ by\r\nTondi (1829) are encyclopedias of inferior quality.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, R. Maffei, a private forester, began to publish the _Revista\r\nforestale del regno d’ Italia_, an annual review, for the purpose of\r\npopularizing forestry in Italy, afterwards changed into a monthly, which\r\ncontinued for some time under subventions from the government.\r\n\r\nA number of propagandist forestry associations were formed at various\r\ntimes, publishing leaflets or journals, one of these _L’Alpe_, a\r\nmonthly, in 1902. In 1910, the two leading societies combined into a\r\nfederation _Pro montibus ed enti affini_, merging also the _Rivista\r\nforestale italiana_ with _L’Alpe_, which serves both propagandist and\r\nprofessional needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAIN.\r\n\r\n  _Revista de Montes_, a semi-official journal, established in 1877,\r\n  is the best source.\r\n\r\n  _El Manuel de Legislacion y Administracion Forestal_, by HILARIO\r\n  RUIZ, and _Novisima Legislacion Forestal_, by DEL CAMPO, 1901,\r\n  elaborate the complicated legislation up to 1894.\r\n\r\n  _Dicionaro Hispano-Americano_, 1893, contains an article (_montes_)\r\n  on the administrative practice of the forest laws.\r\n\r\n  _A Year in Spain_, by a young American (SLIDELL) 1829, gives an\r\n  excellent account of physical conditions of the country and\r\n  character of the people at that time.\r\n\r\n  _Das Moderne Geistesleben in Spanien_, 1883, and\r\n  _Kulturgeschichtliche und Wirtschaftspolitische Betrachtungen_,\r\n  1901, by GUSTAV DIERKS, details character of institutions and\r\n  people.\r\n\r\n“Poor Spain” is the expression which comes to the lips of everybody who\r\ncontemplates the economic conditions of this once so powerful nation,\r\nalmost the ruler of the world. Once, under the beneficent dominion of\r\nthe Saracens, a paradise where, as a Roman author puts it, “Nil otiosum,\r\nnihil sterile in Hispania,” it has become almost a desert through\r\nneglect, indolence, ignorance, false pride, lack of communal spirit,\r\ndespotism of church, and misrule by a corrupt bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a narrow belt along the seashore, the whole of the\r\nIberian peninsula is a vast high mesa, plateau or tableland, 1,500 to\r\n3,000 feet above sea level, traversed by lofty mountain chains, or\r\nsierras, five or six in number, running parallel to each other, mainly\r\nin a westerly and southwesterly direction. These divide the plateau into\r\nas many plains, treeless, and for the most part, arid, exposed to cold\r\nblasts in winter, and burning up in summer. They are frequently\r\nsubjected to severe droughts, which sometimes have lasted for months,\r\nbringing desolation to country and people. The rivers, as they usually\r\ndo in such countries similar to our arid plains, form cañons and\r\narroyos, and, being uncertain in their water stages, none of them are\r\nnavigable although hundreds of miles long, but useful for irrigation, on\r\nwhich agriculture relies. The great mineral wealth had made Spain the\r\nCalifornia of the Carthaginians and Romans, and it is still its most\r\nvaluable resource.\r\n\r\nSpain awakened to civilization through the visits of Phoenicians and\r\nCarthaginians followed by the Romans. During the first centuries of the\r\nChristian era there occurred one of the several periods of extreme\r\nprosperity, when a supposed population of 40 million exploited the\r\ncountry. After the dark days of the Gothic domination, a second period\r\nof prosperity was attained for the portion which came under the sway of\r\nthe industrious and intelligent Moors or Saracens (711 to 1,000 A.D.)\r\nwho made the desert bloom, and whose irrigation works are still the\r\nmainstay of agriculture at present. Centuries of warfare and carnage to\r\nre-establish Christian kingdoms still left the country rich, when, in\r\n1479, the several kingdoms were united into one under Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, and the Moors were finally driven out altogether (1492). This\r\nkingdom persisted in the same form to the present time with only a short\r\nperiod as a republic (1873). Spain was among the first countries to have\r\na constitution.\r\n\r\nAfter the Conquest of the Moors, and with the discovery of America,\r\nagain a period of prosperity set in for the then 20 million people, but,\r\nthrough oppression by State and Church (Inquisition), which also led to\r\nthe expulsion of the Jews and large emigration to America, the\r\nprosperity of the country was destroyed, the population reduced to 10\r\nmillion in 1800, and the conditions of character and government created\r\nwhich are the cause of its present desolation. Since the beginning of\r\nthe century, the population has increased to near 18 million, but\r\nfinancial bankruptcy keeps the government inefficient and unable to\r\naccomplish reforms even if the people would let it have its way.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Forest Conditions._\r\n\r\nIt has been a matter of speculation whether Spain was, or was not, once\r\nheavily wooded (see page 11). In Roman times, only the Province of La\r\nManca is reported as being unforested, and, in the 13th and 14th\r\ncenturies, extensive forest zones are still recorded. The character of\r\nthe country at present, and the climate, both resembling so much our own\r\narid plains, make it questionable to what extent the forest descended\r\nfrom the mountain ranges, which were undoubtedly well wooded.\r\n\r\nAt present the forest is mainly confined to the higher mountains. The\r\nbest is to be found in the Pyrenees and their continuation, the\r\nCantabrian mountains.\r\n\r\nThe area of actual forest (_bosques_) is not known with precision, since\r\nin the official figures mere potential forest, i.e., brush and waste\r\nland, is included (_montes_), and the area varies, i.e., diminishes\r\nthrough new clearings, of which the statistics do not keep account.\r\nMoreover, the statistics refer only to the “public forests,” leaving out\r\nthe statement of private forest areas, if any.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, this area was reported as over 25 million acres or 20 per cent.\r\nof the land area (196,000 square miles); in 1885, the acreage had been\r\nreduced to about 17.5 million acres; and, in 1900, about 16 million\r\nacres, or 13 per cent. of the land area remained as public forest, and\r\nthe total was estimated at somewhat over 20 million acres.\r\n\r\nThe following peculiar classification, published in 1874, gives (in\r\nround figures) at once an insight into the meaning of _montes_, and the\r\nprobable condition of the “public forest” area:\r\n\r\n                                       _Acres._\r\n  State Reserves                         865,000\r\n  Salable State Property               4,550,000\r\n  Public Institute Forest                 20,000\r\n  Communal Forest                      9,860,000\r\n  Open Commons for Wood and Pasture    1,880,000\r\n  Common Pasture for Draft Animals       425,000\r\n                                      ----------\r\n      Total                           17,600,000\r\n\r\nAn estimate of the actual forest (timber and coppice), does not exceed\r\n12 million acres for a population of 18 million, or .7 acres per capita.\r\nThe latest official figures claim as State property around 600,000\r\nacres, and municipal institutional property 11.5 million acres; these\r\nconstituting the public forests. According to official classification,\r\nthese public forests are to the extent of 5.3 million acres high forest,\r\n3 million coppice, the balance brushwoods.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this evident lack of wood material, except for firewood or\r\ncharcoal, the importations in 1903 did not exceed 13.5 million dollars,\r\naccentuating the absence of industrial development. The official\r\nstatement of imports reports 6.5 million dollars more than the above\r\nfigure, but this includes horses and cattle enumerated as forest\r\nproducts--products of the “montes.” These also figure in the\r\nexportations of 15 million dollars, which to the extent of one-half\r\nconsists of cork (some 5 million dollars from 630,000 acres) and\r\ntanbark, while chestnuts, filberts and esparto furnish the balance. In\r\n1908, the imports of lumber and staves alone amounted to $7,382,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, all the public forests produced from wood sales only $900,000,\r\nbut the value of the products taken by rights of user was estimated at\r\nnearly twice that amount. In 1910, the average income of the forest\r\nservice was reported as having averaged for the decade in the\r\nneighborhood of 2 million dollars, and the expense approximately 1\r\nmillion, a net yield of about 30 cents per acre on the area involved\r\nresulting, the total cut being 5.7 million cubic feet annually.\r\n\r\nThe forest flora and its distribution is very similar to that of Italy,\r\nand is described fully in two volumes prepared by a special commission\r\nappointed for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Development of Forest Policy._\r\n\r\nSpain is noted for its comprehensive legislation without execution; it\r\nis also known that official reports are rarely trustworthy, so that what\r\nappears on paper is by no means always found in reality, hence all\r\nstatements must be accepted with reservations.\r\n\r\nThe forest laws of Spain are somewhat similar to those of Italy, yet\r\nshow less appreciation of the needs of technical forest culture. The\r\nvalue of forest resources and need of economy in their use was, indeed,\r\nrecognized early. Recommendations for their conservative use are\r\nrecorded from the 13th century on. An ordinance of Pedro I, in 1351,\r\nimposed heavy fines upon forest destroyers. Ferdinand V, in 1496,\r\nexpressed alarm at the progressing devastation, and, in 1518, we find a\r\nsystem of forest guards established, and even ordinances ordering\r\nreforestation of waste lands, which were again and again repeated during\r\nthe century. In 1567 and 1582, notes of alarm at the continuing\r\ndestruction prove that these ordinances had no effect. The same\r\ncomplaints and fears are expressed by the rulers during the 17th and\r\n18th centuries, without any effective action. In 1748, Ferdinand VI\r\nplaced all forests under government supervision, but in 1812, the Cortes\r\nof Cadiz, under the influence of the spirit of the French Revolution,\r\nrescinded these orders and abolished all restrictions.\r\n\r\nAn awakening to the absolute necessity of action seems not to have\r\narrived until about 1833, when a law was enacted and an ordinance\r\nissued, at great length defining the meaning of “montes,” and\r\ninstituting in the Corps of Civil Engineers a forest inspection. At the\r\nsame time, a special school was to be established in Madrid. This last\r\nproposition does not seem to have materialized, for, in 1840, we find\r\nthat several young men were sent to the forest school at Tharandt\r\n(Germany).\r\n\r\nNo doubt, under the influence of these men on their return, backed by\r\n_La Sociedad Economica_ of Madrid, a commission to formulate a forest\r\nlaw was instituted in 1846, and in the same year, carrying out\r\nordinances of 1835 and 1843, a forest school was established at\r\nVillaviciosa de Odon, later (1869) transferred to the Escurial near\r\nMadrid. This school, under semi-military organization, first with a\r\nthree-year, later a four-year, course, and continually improved and\r\nenlarged in its curriculum (one Director and 13 professors in 1900), is\r\nthe pride of the Spanish foresters, to all appearances deservedly so. It\r\nwas organized after German models by Bernardo della Torre Royas as first\r\nDirector.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a forest department, however, _Cuerpo de Montes_, had to\r\nwait until 1853. This department, under the Minister of Public Works\r\n(now under the Minister of Agriculture), is a close corporation made up\r\nof the graduates of the school as _Ingenieros de Montes_, acceptance\r\ninto which is based upon graduation and four years’ service in the\r\nforest department as assistants besides the performance of some\r\nmeritorious work. The school stands in close relation to the department\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe first work of the new administration was a general forest survey to\r\nascertain conditions, and especially to determine which of the public\r\nforests, under the laws of 1855 and 1859, it was desirable to retain.\r\nThe investigation showed that there was more forest (defined as in the\r\nabove classification) than had been supposed, but that it was in even\r\nworse condition than had been known. The public forests, i.e., those\r\nowned by the State, the communities and public institutions, were\r\ndivided into three classes according to the species by which formed,\r\nwhich was the easiest way of determining their location as regards\r\naltitude, and their public value; namely, the coniferous forest and\r\ndeciduous oak and chestnut forests, which were declared inalienable; the\r\nforests of ash, alder, willow, etc., naturally located in the lower\r\nlevels, therefore without interest to the state, which were declared\r\nsalable; and an intermediate third class composed of cork oak and\r\nevergreen oak, whose status as to propriety of sale was left in doubt.\r\nIn 1862, a revision of this classification left out this doubtful class,\r\nadding it and the forest areas of the first class which were not at\r\nleast 250 acres in extent to the salable property. The first class,\r\nwhich was to be reserved, was found to comprise nearly 17 million acres\r\n(of which 1.2 million was owned by the State), while the salable\r\nproperty was found to be about half that area.\r\n\r\nEver since, a constant wrangle and commotion has been kept up regarding\r\nthe classification, and repeated attempts, sometimes successful, have\r\nbeen made by one faction, usually led by the Minister of Finance, to\r\nreduce the public forest area (_desamortizadoro_), opposed by another\r\nfaction under the lead of the forest administration, which was forced\r\nagain and again to re-classify. In 1883, the alienable public forest\r\narea was by decree placed under the Minister of Finance, the inalienable\r\npart remaining under the Minister of Public Works (_Fomento_); very much\r\nthe same as it was in the United States until recently. The public debt\r\nand immediate financial needs of the corporations gave the incentive for\r\ndesiring the disposal of forest property, and, to satisfy this demand,\r\nit was ordered, in 1878, that all receipts from the State property and\r\n20 per cent. of the receipts from communal forests were to be applied\r\ntowards the extinguishment of the debt.\r\n\r\nThe ups and downs in this struggle to keep the public forests intact\r\nwere accentuated on the one hand by the pressing needs of taking care of\r\nthe debt, on the other hand by drought and flood. Thus, in 1874, the\r\nsale in annual instalments of over 4.5 million acres in the hands of the\r\nMinister of Finance was ordered, but the floods of the same year were so\r\ndisastrous, (causing 7 million dollars damage, 760 deaths, 28,000\r\nhomeless), being followed by successive droughts, that a reversion of\r\nsentiment was experienced, which led to the enactment of a reboisement\r\nlaw in 1877. This law, having in view better management of communal\r\nproperties, ordered with all sorts of unnecessary technical details, the\r\nimmediate reforestation of all waste land in the public forests,\r\ncreating for that purpose a corps of 400 cultivators (_capatacas de\r\ncultivos_). To furnish the funds for this work the communities were to\r\ncontribute 10 per cent. of the value of the forest products they sold or\r\nwere entitled to. But funds were not forthcoming, and, by 1895, under\r\nthis law only 21,000 acres had been reforested (three-fourths by\r\nsowing).\r\n\r\nThe financial results of the management of the public forests, although\r\nthe forest department probably did the best it could under the\r\ncircumstances, had, indeed, not been reassuring. In 1861, a deficit of\r\n$26,000 was recorded; in 1870, $600,000 worth of material was sold, 1.3\r\nmillion dollars worth given away, and $700,000 worth destroyed.\r\nAltogether, by fire and theft, it was estimated that 15 per cent. of\r\nthe production was lost. In 1885, this loss was estimated at 25 per\r\ncent., when the net income had attained to 15 cents per acre, or, on the\r\n17.5 million acres to less than three million dollars.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered that the governors of provinces and their\r\nappointees, besides the village authorities, had also a hand in the\r\nadministration, it is no wonder that the forest department was pretty\r\nnearly helpless. While, under the law of 1863, the department was\r\nspecially ordered to regulate the management of communal forests and to\r\ngauge the cut to the increment, the political elements in the\r\nadministration, which appointed the forest guards, made the regulations\r\nmostly nugatory.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1900, a new era seems to have arrived, a thorough\r\nreorganization was made, which lends hope for a better future. The\r\ntechnical administration was divorced from the political influence and\r\nplaced under the newly created Minister of Agriculture. The machinery of\r\nthe _Cuerpo de Montes_ was remodeled. This consists now of one Chief\r\nInspector-General, four Division Chiefs, ten Inspectors-General for\r\nfield inspection, 50 chief engineers of district managers, 185\r\nassistants, and 342 foresters and guards, the latter now appointed by\r\nthe department, instead of the Governors, and not all, as formerly,\r\nchosen from veteran soldiers. The better financial showing referred to\r\nabove was the result.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, a special reboisement service, the _Servicio Hidrological\r\nForestal_, was also placed on a new footing, the country being divided\r\ninto ten districts for this purpose, and an engineer placed in charge\r\nof each. But from a statement that, in 1910, of some 300,000 acres\r\nplanned to be recovered only 31,000 had been completed it may be\r\ninferred that financial difficulties still retard the work.\r\n\r\nPrivate forests, which had been without any interference, were, in 1908,\r\nplaced under government control so far as located within a defined\r\nprotective zone (_zona protectora dasocratica_). Such must be managed\r\nunder plans provided by the Forest Service, and in case of refusal on\r\nthe part of owners expropriation proceedings are provided, but the money\r\nfor taking advantage of this provision would probably not be in the\r\nTreasury. Indeed, according to Professor Miguel del Campo at the\r\nEscurial forest school, results so far are nil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince 1896, popular education is attempted through Arbor days, various\r\nassociations fostering the idea; in 1904, _La Fiesta del Arbol_ was made\r\na national holiday, and premiums are distributed for plantations made on\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nThe _Revista de Montes_, a semi-official monthly journal, began its\r\npublication in 1877, and serves the purpose of propaganda, as well as\r\nthe professional needs. A considerable book literature is also\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTUGAL.\r\n\r\n  A pamphlet written for the International Exposition at Rio de\r\n  Janeiro in 1908, contains a chapter written by a forester, Borges,\r\n  which gives most recent and authentic information.\r\n\r\n  Besides notes scattered through the literature, an article by L.\r\n  Pardée, a French botanist, in Revue des Eaux et Forêts, 1911, gives\r\n  an extensive description of forest conditions and especially of the\r\n  forest of Leiria.\r\n\r\nThe small kingdom which occupies the west coast of the Iberian\r\npeninsula, with 34,000 square miles and 6 million people, is in many\r\nrespects similar to Spain, except that a larger portion is fertile,\r\nbeing situated in the litoral region, the climate less excessive, and\r\nthe people somewhat more enterprising. Not much more than one-half of\r\nthe country, however, is utilized; nearly 15,000 square miles being\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nThree sections or zones are recognized, the northern, bounding on Spain\r\nwhich is mainly mountainous but also contains extensive sand dunes, is\r\nthe best wooded; the central, which is hilly and less well wooded,\r\ncontains (in Estremadura and Beira) one of the most desolate regions of\r\nEurope and at the same time the best managed forest; the southern, the\r\nrichest in farm lands, with semi-tropic climate and flora, the zone of\r\nevergreen broadleaf flora.\r\n\r\nAbout 10% of the land area, or 4 million acres are under forest,\r\nalthough 2 million more are wooded with olive, fig, almond plantations,\r\nor open woodlands and brushwood. Of the actual forest area the State\r\nowns only 82,000 acres, 30,000 of which reforested areas or sand dunes\r\nin process of recovery.\r\n\r\nThe composition is nearly one-half of pine (_Pinus maritima_ and\r\n_pinea_), one-fifth, cork oak “with pastures,” a little over one-fifth,\r\nother evergreen oaks “with pastures,” and the balance, chestnut and\r\ndeciduous oaks.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the extensive private ownership and the reference to the\r\npastures in the enumeration of forest areas suffice to give an idea of\r\nthe condition of most of them. The oak forest is also to a large extent\r\nstill used for hog raising.\r\n\r\nBesides the native forest areas, there are in existence a number of\r\nparks and plantations of exotics, the climate of Portugal in parts\r\nresembling that of California and permitting a wide range of\r\nintroductions, even tropical. There is perhaps nowhere such a good\r\nopportunity of seeing the most varied forest flora in fine development\r\nas the forest parks of Montserrate, of Bussaco, and in the various\r\nbotanical gardens.\r\n\r\nExtensive Eucalyptus and Acacia plantations, some 1500 acres, of high\r\neconomical value, near Abrantés, are the enterprise of a private\r\nlandowner, W. C. Tait.\r\n\r\nThe deficiency of wood supplies is covered by an importation of about\r\n1.5 million dollars against which there is an export of a little over\r\nhalf a million, mainly cooperage stock. The best developed forest\r\nindustry is the growing of cork giving rise to an export of around 5\r\nmillion dollars. A considerable naval store production is also\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at a real management of the State’s property dates\r\nfrom 1868; a regular organization, however, did not take place until\r\n1872, when, under the Director-General of Commerce and Industries, a\r\nforest administrator with a technical staff of three division chiefs,\r\ncorresponding to the three sections of country, and six forestmasters\r\nwere installed.\r\n\r\nAt present, the staff of the Inspector consists of 8 technically\r\neducated assistants, each in charge of some branch of service. Under\r\nthese, there are a number of field agents or supervisors (some 14 in\r\n1903) with less education, and underforesters and guards.\r\n\r\nThe only really well managed forest, the pride of the Portuguese\r\nforesters, is the forest of Leiria in Estremadura, a planted pinery of\r\nabout 25,000 acres, on which over 50 men of various grades are employed,\r\nwith naval store distilleries, impregnating works, and saw mills. Its\r\nmanagement (in natural seed tree system) dates from 1892.\r\n\r\nBesides attending to the management of the State forests, a committee\r\ncomposed of the administrator and some of the technical staff, were to\r\nexamine the country and decide what parts needed reforestation. As a\r\nresult of a very full report, in 1882, a reboisement law was enacted\r\nunder which some of the sand dunes were fixed.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, a more thorough organization of this work took place, which,\r\nwith liberal appropriations, promises more rapid progress.\r\n\r\nThis law recognizes two ways of placing private property under a\r\nforestry regime, namely obligatory and facultative or voluntary.\r\nTerritory in the mountains and on dunes may if deemed by the superior\r\nAgricultural Council as requiring it from the point of view of public\r\nutility be placed under the regime by royal decree. Or else private\r\nowners may ask to have their properties so placed, either merely\r\nsecuring police protection, obligating themselves to keep the property\r\nwooded, or working under a working plan or reforestation plan provided\r\nby the Forest Service.\r\n\r\nIn either case the owner is obliged to pay the guards and at the rate of\r\nabout 2 cents per acre for the working plans. Planting material is\r\nfurnished free or at cost price, and exemption from taxes for 20 years\r\nis granted for reforested lands. Expropriation of waste lands declared\r\nas of public interest is provided, if owners object to enforced\r\nreforestation. Some 275,000 acres have so far been placed under the\r\nforestry regime.\r\n\r\nThere are provisions for forestry education in the School of Agriculture\r\nat Lisbon, or the education for the higher positions in the forest\r\nservice may be secured at German or French forest schools, and some have\r\nsecured it at Vallambrosa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN AND HER COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Historical Inquiries concerning Forests and Forest Laws_, by\r\n  PERCIVAL LEWIS, 1811, gives a full account of the practices in the\r\n  old ban forests.\r\n\r\n  _English Forests and Forest Trees_, 1853, anonymous, gives an\r\n  interesting account of the old ‘forests’ and their history.\r\n\r\n  _Our Forests and Woodlands_, by JOHN NISBET, 1900, has a chapter on\r\n  the historical development of forest laws.\r\n\r\n  WM. SCHLICH, Manual of Forestry, vol. I, 3d ed., 1906, brings in\r\n  convenient form an account of conditions in various parts of the\r\n  British Empire.\r\n\r\n  SCHWAPPACH, _Forstliche Zustände in England_, Zeitschrift für Forst-\r\n  und Jagdwesen, 1903, is an account of forest conditions from the pen\r\n  of a practical observer.\r\n\r\n  B. RIBBENTROP, Forestry in India, 1900. Also various reports of the\r\n  forest departments of the various British Colonies.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the nation which can boast of the most\r\nextensive forest department in one of her colonies, has at home not yet\r\nbeen able to come to an intelligent conception even, not to speak of\r\napplication, of proper forest policy or forest economy.\r\n\r\nOne of the English authorities on the subject writes still in 1900:\r\n“With so much land of poor quality lying uncultivated in many parts of\r\nthe British Isles, the apathy shown towards forestry in Britain is one\r\nof the things that it is impossible to understand.”\r\n\r\nIf we should venture to seek for an explanation, we would find it in\r\ngeographical and physical conditions, but still more in personal and\r\npolitical characteristics, historically developed, such as also in the\r\nUnited States make progress of forestry slower than it would otherwise\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nDue to her insular position with which in part the development of her\r\nnaval supremacy is connected, England can readily supply her needs by\r\nimportations. Situated within the influence of the Gulf stream, the\r\nclimate is much milder than her northern location would indicate, and is\r\nin no respect excessive. The topography is mostly gentle, except in\r\nScotland and Wales, and the riverflow even all the year. Hence the\r\nabsence of forestcover has not been felt in its physical influences.\r\n\r\nBritons, Picts, Scots, Scandinavians, Anglo-Saxons and Normans are the\r\nelements which have amalgamated to make the English people. Through\r\nendless warfare and political struggle the three countries, England,\r\nScotland and Ireland had, by the year 1600, come under one ruler,\r\nalthough final legislative union with Scotland did not take place until\r\n1707, and with Ireland not until 1800.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, forming a constitutional monarchy, practically, an\r\naristocracy with republican tendencies, the history of the islands has\r\nbeen a struggle, first to establish race supremacy, then to secure the\r\nascendency of the nobility and landholders over the king and the\r\ncommoners, in which the former have been more successful than the barons\r\nin other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nPolitically, the Englishman is an individualist, jealous of his private\r\ninterests and unwilling to submit to government interference for the\r\npublic welfare. Hence, State forestry, which is finally the only\r\nsolution of the forestry problem, appears objectionable. Commercial and\r\nindustrial enterprise rather than economic development appeals to him;\r\nthe practical issue of the day rather than demands of a future and\r\nsystematic preparation for the same occupy his mind. He lacks, as Mr.\r\nRoseberry points out, scientific method, and hence is wasteful.\r\nMoreover, he is conservative and self-satisfied beyond the citizens of\r\nany other nation, hence if all the wisdom of the world point new ways,\r\nhe will still cling to his accustomed ones. In the matter of having\r\ncommissions appointed to investigate and report, and leaving things to\r\ncontinue in unsatisfactory condition he reminds one of Spanish\r\ndilatoriness. These would appear to us the reasons for the difficulty\r\nwhich the would-be reformers experience in bringing about economic\r\nreforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Forest Conditions._\r\n\r\nCæsar’s and Strabo’s descriptions agree that Great Britain was a densely\r\nwooded country. The forest area seems to have been reduced much less\r\nthrough long-continued use, than through destruction by fire and\r\npasture, and by subsequent formation of moors, so that it is now,\r\nexcepting that of Portugal, the smallest of any European nation in\r\nproportion to total area, and, excepting that of Holland, in proportion\r\nto population.\r\n\r\nOf the 121,380 square miles, which Great Britain and Ireland represent,\r\nless than 4 per cent., or 3 million acres, (880,000 in Scotland, 303,000\r\nin Ireland) are forested, one-fourteenth of an acre per capita; but\r\nthere are nearly 33% of waste lands, namely over 12 million acres of\r\nheaths, moors and other waste lands capable of forest growth, and\r\nanother 12 million acres partly or doubtfully so, while the\r\nagricultural land in crops and pasture comprises about 48 million\r\nacres. The waste areas re-forested, it is believed, could meet the\r\nconsumption now supplied by importations. Notably in Scotland, extensive\r\nheaths and moors of many hundred square miles in the Northern Highlands\r\nand the Grampian mountains--well wooded in olden times, the woods having\r\nbeen eradicated supposedly for strategic reasons--are now without farms\r\nor forests, and are mainly used for shooting preserves. In the last\r\nthirty years, the land under tillage has continuously decreased, and now\r\nrepresents less than 25 per cent. of the whole land area, grasslands\r\noccupying 38 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural land as well as the mountain and heath lands, are to\r\nthe largest extent owned by large proprietors (in 1876, 11,000 persons\r\nowned 72 per cent. of the total area of the British Islands). With the\r\nexception of 67,000 acres of crownlands, the entire forest area is owned\r\nprivately, and that mostly by large landed proprietors, there being no\r\ncommunal ownership, except that the municipality of London owns a forest\r\narea (Epping Forest) devoted to pleasure, and the Water Board of\r\nLiverpool has begun to plant some of its catchment basins.\r\n\r\nPractically the entire wood supply is imported, and the rate of\r\nimportation is rapidly increasing. While in 1864 it was 3.4 million\r\ntons, in 1892, 7.8 million tons worth 92 million dollars; in 1899, 10\r\nmillion tons and 125 million dollars; in 1902, it had grown to 138\r\nmillion dollars, and in 1906 to 141 million (700 million cubic feet) in\r\nwhich $7.4 million of wood manufactures, against which an export of $19\r\nmillion mainly wood manufactures, must be offset. This makes England\r\nthe largest wood importer in the world, Germany coming next, and the\r\namount paid to other countries exceeds the value of her pig iron output.\r\nNearly 90 per cent. of the import is coniferous material, from Sweden,\r\nRussia and Canada. The home product, mostly oak ties, mineprops, etc.,\r\nsatisfies about one-sixth of the consumption. In addition to timber and\r\nlumber, over 10 million dollars of wood pulp, and 60 million dollars of\r\nby-products are imported. The total wood consumption per capita is\r\nbetween 12 and 14 cubic feet, half of what it was 50 years ago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPine is the only native conifer of timber value, and oak is the most\r\nimportant native deciduous tree, found mostly in coppice or in old,\r\novermature, straggling pasture woods. Compact larger forest areas are\r\nentirely absent, but there are many small plantations and parks. For,\r\nwhile Englishmen have not been foresters, they have been active\r\ntreeplanters, and the mild climate has permitted the introduction of\r\nmany exotics, especially American conifers. Most of these plantings have\r\nbeen for park and game purposes. The most noted forest plantations are\r\nfound in Scotland, among them the larch plantations of the Duke of\r\nAthole (begun in 1728), of at one time over 10,000 acres, the ducal\r\nwoodlands now covering over 20,000 acres; the pinery of 25,000 acres,\r\nbelonging to the Countess of Sealfield, the best managed forest\r\nproperty, partly in natural regeneration, and others. But these\r\nplantations too are mostly widely spaced and trimmed, hence not\r\nproducing timber of much value, so that timber of British production is\r\nusually ruled out by architects.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Development of Forest Policies._\r\n\r\nThe Saxons and Normans were primarily hunters, and this propensity to\r\nthe chase has impressed itself upon their forest treatment into modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic Saxons undoubtedly brought with them the feudal and\r\ncommunal institutions of the Germans, under which territory for the\r\nking’s special pleasure in the chase was set aside as ‘forest’, and this\r\nexclusive right and privilege was on other territory extended to the\r\nvassals, while the commoners were excluded from the exercise of hunting\r\nprivileges on these grounds.\r\n\r\nThe Normans not only increased the lands under ‘ban’, but they increased\r\nalso in a despotic manner the penalties and punishments for infraction\r\nof the forest laws, and enforced them more stringently than was done on\r\nthe continent. The feudal system was developed to its utmost. Besides\r\n‘forests’ in which the king alone had exclusive rights, and in which a\r\ncode of special laws, administered under special courts, was applied,\r\nthere were set aside ‘chases’, hunting reserves without the pale of the\r\nforest laws; ‘parks’, smaller, enclosed hunting grounds; and ‘warrens’,\r\nprivileged by royal grant or prescription as preserves for small game.\r\nWhole villages were wiped out, or lived almost in bondage to satisfy\r\nthis taste for sport. In the ‘forests’, of which in Elizabeth’s time not\r\nless than 75 distinct ones were enumerated, withdrawing an immense area\r\nfrom free use, both ‘vert’ and ‘venison’,--wood and game,--belonged to\r\nthe king; a host of officers,--stewards, verderers, foresters,\r\nregarders, agistors, woodwards,--exercised police duties, and oppressed\r\nand ground the people by extortions, while special courts,--‘woodmote’,\r\n‘swainmote’, ‘court of justice seat’,--enforced the savage and cruel\r\nlaws. The first of these laws was supposed to date from Canute the\r\nGreat, in 1016, but was eventually found to be a forgery perpetrated by\r\nWilliam I in order to lend historical color to his assertion of ‘forest’\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nA partial reduction of forests, and a modification of the cruelty and\r\nunreasonableness of the laws was obtained by the _Charta de Foresta_, in\r\n1225, which formulated the laws into a code, and again by the Forest\r\nOrdinance of 1306. But not until 1483, under Edward IV, were the people\r\nliving within ‘forests’ permitted to cut and sell timber, and to fence\r\nin for seven years portions of the reserved territory. The last\r\nterritory was ‘afforested’, i.e., withdrawn for purposes of the chase,\r\nunder Henry VIII, but he had to secure the consent of the freeholders.\r\nThe Long Parliament, in 1641, stopped at least the extension of forests,\r\nand modified the application of the laws to a more reasonable degree.\r\n\r\nThe forest laws are still on the statutes, but have fallen into\r\ndesuetude; the last ‘forest court of justice seat’ was held under\r\nCharles I. The ‘forests’ themselves have also almost entirely vanished,\r\nsome being abolished as late as Queen Victoria’s time, by act of\r\nparliament, but the last action under the ‘forest laws’ was had in 1862\r\nwhen the Duke of Athole tried to establish his right as ‘forester’ for\r\nthe crown. A full account of the forest laws is contained in Manwood’s\r\nvolume, the title page of which is here reproduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                   A\r\n                    TREATISE OF THE LAWES OF THE FO-\r\n                  rest: Wherein is declared not onely\r\n       _those Lawes, as they are now in force, but also the ori-_\r\n        ginall and beginning of Forests: And what a Forest is in\r\n         his owne proper nature, and wherein the same doth dif-\r\n         fer from a Chase, a Parke, or a Warren, with all such\r\n          things as are incident or belonging there into, with\r\n                 their seuerall proper tearmes of Art.\r\n\r\n                         ALSO A TREATISE OF THE\r\n            Pourallee, declaring what Pourallee is, how the\r\n     same first began, what a Pourallee man may do, how he may hunt\r\n      and vse his owne Pourallee, how farre he may pursue and fol-\r\n      low after his chase, together with the limits and bounds, as\r\n                 well of the Forest, as the Pourallee.\r\n\r\n             Collected, as well out of the Common Lawes and\r\n  _Statutes of this land, As also out of sundrie learned auncient Au_-\r\n       thors, and out of the Assises of Pickering and Lancaster,\r\n                           by IOHN MANVVOOD.\r\n\r\n       _Whereunto are added the Statutes of the Forest, a Trea_-\r\n    tise of the seuerall offices of Verderors, Regardors, and Fore-\r\n     sters, & the Courts of Attachments, Swanimote, & Iustice seat\r\n       of the Forest, and certaine principall Cases, Iudgements,\r\n            and Entries of the Assises of Pickering and Lan-\r\n                  caster: neuer heretofore printed for\r\n                              the publique\r\n\r\n                                LONDON,\r\n                Printed for the Societie of Stationers,\r\n                           _Anno Dom._ 1615.\r\n\r\n                           _Cum Priuilegio._\r\n\r\nFacsimile of Title page of Manwood’s celebrated volume.\r\n\r\n(Original, the property of Mr. Joly de Lotbinière).]\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the same usages and laws existed, only very much less\r\nrigorously enforced, until, in 1681, the extension of ‘forests’ was\r\ndiscontinued by parliamentary act.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that the term forest did only distantly refer to\r\nwoodland and that no economic policy had anything to do with the laws.\r\nOnly incidentally was forest growth protected and preserved for the sake\r\nof the chase--the same medieval policy which still largely animates the\r\nforest policy of the State of New York.\r\n\r\nThe woods outside the ‘forests’, which had mainly served for the raising\r\nof hogs, and for domestic needs, experienced at various times unusual\r\nreduction by fire. General Monk, among others, laid waste large areas on\r\nthe Scottish borderland in Cromwell’s time.\r\n\r\nThe first serious inroads by extensive fellings occurred under Edward\r\nIII in the first half of the 14th century to enrich the treasury for the\r\nFrench wars. Again, Henry VIII in the 16th century, when he seized the\r\nchurch properties for his own use, turned them into cash. A hundred\r\nyears later, James I reduced the forest area, especially in Ireland, by\r\nhis colonization schemes. Yet both, Henry VIII and James I, are on\r\nrecord as encouraging forest planting for utility. Charles I, James’\r\nsuccessor, always in need of cash, alienated many of the crown forests,\r\nand turned them into cash, besides extorting money through the forest\r\ncourts. During the Revolution, beginning in 1642, and during Cromwell’s\r\nreign a licentious devastation of the confiscated or mortgaged\r\nnoblemen’s woods took place.\r\n\r\nFinally, under Charles II, the needs for the royal navy forced attention\r\nto the reduction of wood supplies, and as a result of the agitation to\r\nencourage the growth of timber, a member of the newly formed Royal\r\nSociety was deputed to prepare an essay, which, published in 1662, has\r\nbecome the classic work of English forest literature, namely John\r\nEvelyn’s _Sylva_, or “_A Discourse of Forest Trees_,” which has\r\nexperienced eleven editions. It should, however, be mentioned that an\r\nearlier writer, whom Evelyn often quotes, Tuffer, before the reign of\r\nElizabeth, in 1526, published his “Five Hundred Points of Husbandry,” a\r\nversification in which treeplanting received attention. Ever since that\r\ntime, periodically and spasmodically, the question of forestry has been\r\nagitated, without much serious result.\r\n\r\nFrom 1775 to 1781, the Society of Arts in London offered gold medals and\r\nprizes for treeplanting, and in the beginning of the 19th century a\r\nrevival of arboricultural interest was experienced, perhaps as a result\r\nof an interesting report by the celebrated Admiral Nelson on the\r\nmismanagement of the forest of Dean, concern for naval timber giving the\r\nincentive, in which he recommended the planting of oak for investment.\r\n\r\nAt that time, a Surveyor-General, with an insufficient force, was in\r\ncharge of the crown forests. In 1809, the management was placed under a\r\nboard of three Commissioners, one of whom being a member of the\r\nparliament was to be changed with the administration. Under this\r\nmanagement, graft became so rampant that, in 1848, a committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons was appointed, whose report revealed the most\r\nastonishing rottenness, placing a stigma on government management such\r\nas we still uncover in the United States from time to time. A\r\nreorganization took place in 1851. At that time the royal forests and\r\nparks, reduced in extent to about 200,000 acres, showed a deficiency of\r\n$125,000, mostly, to be sure, occasioned by the parks. There was then\r\nstill a tribute of some 600 bucks to be delivered to various personages,\r\nas was the ancient usage.\r\n\r\nAt present there are some 115,000 acres classed as royal forest, but\r\nonly 67,000 acres are really forest, consisting of more or less\r\nmismanaged woods, under the administration, not forest management, of\r\nthe Commissioners of Woods and Forests, with Deputy Surveyors in charge\r\nof the ranges. Although there are a few notable exceptions in the\r\nmanagement, it is to be noted that the same stupid ignorance, which\r\nintroduced the clause into the Constitution of the State of New York,\r\nwas enacted into law in 1877 by the English Parliament, forbidding in\r\nthe New Forest all cutting and planting. In 1900, there existed just one\r\nplanting plan, made by a professional forester, namely, for a portion of\r\nthe forest of Dean, while now only two other State properties and two or\r\nthree private estates are managed under working plans.\r\n\r\nIn 1887, a Committee appointed to inquire into the administration of\r\nthis property, expressed itself most dissatisfied, but a Committee of\r\nParliament in 1890 whitewashed the administration and reported that the\r\nmanagement was satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThese committees, as well as an earlier one, in 1885, were also to\r\nrecommend measures for the advancement of forestry. They laid in their\r\nrecommendations the main stress upon education, but no action followed,\r\nand it can be said that the government has never done anything for the\r\nadvancement of forestry in the home country, whatever it may have done\r\nfor the dependencies. A Departmental Committee again reported in 1902\r\nwith all sorts of recommendations, which have remained unheeded.\r\n\r\nThe interests of forestry as far as the government is concerned are at\r\npresent committed to the Board of Agriculture, an unwieldy body created\r\nin 1889, from which this Departmental Committee was appointed. There is\r\nnow, however, a strong movement on foot, led by foresters returned from\r\nIndia, to commit the government to some action with reference to the\r\nwaste lands, and towards providing for educational means.\r\n\r\nAnother committee, appointed in 1908 to enquire into prospects of\r\nafforestation in Ireland, reported in favor of acquiring 300,000 acres\r\nof wood and 700,000 acres of unplanted land, dwelling especially on the\r\nbenefit to be secured by providing employment and a check upon\r\nemigration of the rural population. Instead of acting upon this\r\nproposition the government directed the Royal Commission on Coast\r\nErosion, which had issued its first report in 1907, to suspend its\r\ninquiry into the inroads of the sea and apply themselves to the inquiry\r\nas to “whether in connection with unclaimed lands or otherwise it is\r\ndesirable to make an experiment in afforestation as a means of\r\nincreasing employment during periods of depression, and how, and by whom\r\nsuch experiment should be conducted.”\r\n\r\nIn 1909, the Royal Commission on Afforestation and Coast Erosion\r\nreported at length, proposing the reforestation by a special Commission\r\nof nine million acres of waste land at a rate of 75,000 or 150,000 acres\r\na year to be acquired by purchase--an elaborate plan, which so far has\r\nremained without result.\r\n\r\nThe government, although various committees have recommended it, has\r\nremained also callous in respect to educational policy, except that, in\r\n1904, the Commissioners of Woods and Forests instituted a school (one\r\ninstructor) in the Forest of Dean for the education of woodsmen and\r\nforemen.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of the government’s peculiar attitude to forest policy\r\nin general, we may note a curious anachronism, namely the act of 1894,\r\nwhich relieves railway companies from liability for damage from\r\nlocomotive fires, if they can prove that they have exercised all care,\r\nalthough traction engines cannot offer this excuse.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to secure educational facilities dates to 1884 when a\r\nchair of forestry was established in the Royal Engineering College at\r\nCooper’s Hill, an institution designed to prepare for service in India\r\npurely. Through private subscriptions, another chair of forestry was\r\ninstituted in 1887 at the University of Edinburgh, and several\r\nagricultural colleges, notably that of Cirencester, as well as the\r\nUniversities of Cambridge and Oxford, had made provisions for teaching\r\nthe subject in a way, but outside of Cooper’s Hill no adequate education\r\nin forestry was obtainable in Great Britain, until 1905.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, the forest department in Cooper’s Hill was transferred to\r\nOxford, the three years’ course--one year to be spent in the forests of\r\nGermany or other countries--being as before designed mainly for\r\naspirants to the Indian forest service. Now, besides Oxford, some nine\r\nother institutions offer courses in forestry--the reason for this\r\neducational development being difficult to imagine.\r\n\r\nThe name of Sir William Schlich, a German forester, and for some time\r\nthe head of the Indian forest department now in charge of this school,\r\nis most prominently connected with the reform movement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAltogether forest management and silvicultural practice are still nearly\r\nunknown in England, and, until within a few years, the useful idea of\r\nworking plans had not yet penetrated the minds of owners of estates.\r\nThis apathy is, no doubt, in part due to the fact that the government is\r\nin the hands of the nobility, who prefer to keep their “shooting\r\nranges”, and do not see even a financial advantage from turning them\r\ninto forest as long as they can derive a rent of from 10 to 40 cents per\r\nacre for shooting privileges.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPrivate endeavor has been active through the two arboricultural\r\nsocieties, the Royal Scotch, founded in 1854, and the Royal English,\r\nbeginning its labors in 1880. The transactions of these societies in\r\nannual or occasional volumes represented the current magazine\r\nliterature on forestry since the monthly Journal of Forestry and Estates\r\nManagement, which began its career in London in 1877, transferred to\r\nEdinburgh in 1884, ceased to exist in 1885.\r\n\r\nAt present, a very well conducted Quarterly Journal of Forestry, started\r\nin 1907 by the Royal English Arboricultural Society replacing its\r\nTransactions and that of the Irish Forestry Association, also the\r\nJournal of the Board of Agriculture, occasionally, supply the needs of\r\nthe continuously improving chances for development on forestry lines.\r\nUntil within a short time the English professional book literature has\r\nbeen extremely meager, although a considerable propagandist,\r\narboricultural, and general magazine literature exists. Schlich’s\r\n_Manual of Forestry_, first in three volumes published from 1889 to\r\n1895, now in its second to fourth edition, enlarged to five volumes, is\r\nthe most comprehensive publication. Another author deserving mention is\r\nJohn Nisbet, known by his _Studies in Forestry_ (1894), who also\r\nengrafted continental silvicultural notions into later editions of James\r\nBrown’s _The Forester_, an encyclopædic work of merit. Several German\r\nand French works have been translated into English, notably K. Gayer:\r\nDie Forstbenutzung; R. Hess: Der Forstschutz; H. Fürst: Waldschutz.\r\n\r\nJohn Croumbie Brown’s sixteen volumes on forests and forestry in various\r\ncountries may be mentioned among the propagandist literature. The\r\nArboricultural Societies mentioned also make a brave effort to advance\r\nprofessional development of forestry in their publications.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIA.\r\n\r\nWhile so neglectful of her forest interests at home, Great Britain has\r\ndeveloped in her possessions in the East Indies a far-seeing policy,\r\nand, under the lead of German influence, has established there one of\r\nthe largest, if not most efficient, forest departments in the world.\r\n\r\nContrary to a frequently expressed idea that the conditions and problems\r\nof India are comparable to the conditions and problems of the United\r\nStates, so that the example of Great Britain in India rather than that\r\nof any European country might serve us in the United States, the writer\r\nthinks that the very opposite is true. Not only are the natural\r\nconditions for the most part different, India being mainly tropical with\r\nan entirely different flora and different conditions of growth, but\r\nindustrial, cultural, social and political conditions are also entirely\r\ndifferent; all of which entails difference in methods of procedure.\r\nThere are, to be sure, a few points of similarity: the large size of\r\ncountry under one government, and that in the hands of an English\r\nspeaking race; the fact that the fire scourge, as with us, but from\r\ndifferent reasons, is still the greatest problem; that there are arid\r\nregions and deserts (not over 10 per cent.), and irrigation problems and\r\nflood dangers to deal with; and finally the long delay in establishing a\r\ndefinite forest policy. Although this policy was inaugurated over 40\r\nyears ago, India has not yet, and will by the nature of things, not soon\r\npass out of the first stage of development which we may confidently\r\nexpect to pass through much more rapidly, due to the conditions in\r\nwhich we resemble Europe more closely.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of India, namely 62 per cent. of the 1,773,000 square\r\nmiles, is under British administration, and is peopled by a subject race\r\nof nearly 240 million, without a voice in their government, which is\r\ncarried on by a small handful of the conquerors (about 100,000\r\nEnglishmen are living in India), while the balance, around 700,000\r\nsquare miles with 53 million people, is divided among a large number of\r\nmore or less independent native States, very different in their\r\ncivilization from ours.\r\n\r\nIndustrially, the difference will appear from the statement that about\r\n70 per cent. of the population is engaged in agricultural pursuits,\r\nhence there is no active wood market as with us, except for domestic\r\npurposes, and, as the woods, like those of most tropical forest, are\r\nmainly cabinet woods, even the export trade is insignificant, amounting\r\nto hardly 3 million dollars, while minor forest products (lac, cutch and\r\ngambier, myrobalan, caoutchouc, etc.) represent about 12 million\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nClimatically, as is to be expected, on such a large territory, great\r\nvariation exists, which is increased by differences in altitude from the\r\nsea level to the tops of the Himalayas. The climate is, of course,\r\nlargely tropical, with a rainfall which varies from the heaviest known,\r\nof 600 inches, to almost none at all.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of these differences from our conditions, much\r\nmay be learned from Indian experience in the matter of organization,\r\nboth to follow and to avoid, and the fact that this can be done without\r\nthe need of a foreign language will be attractive to most Americans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe British, like other nations, gained a foothold in India for trading\r\npurposes during the 17th century. This they extended during the 18th\r\ncentury, especially after they had attained the ascendancy by Clive’s\r\nsubjection, in 1757, of the great Mogul, one of the most powerful native\r\nprinces. By conquest and amicable arrangement, the territory of British\r\ninfluence was gradually increased through the agency of the East India\r\nCompany, until, in 1858, the British government in India was formally\r\nestablished by royal proclamation; and, in 1877, it was declared an\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nAs stated, native princes still control, under British influence and\r\nrestrictions, over one-third of the country, or a territory of nearly\r\n700,000 square miles, divided into 13 feudatory states. The total area\r\nunder direct British control and government is 1,087,000 square miles,\r\nof which 25 per cent. (280,000 square miles) is probably forested and\r\nwaste, some 232,000 square miles or nearly 150 million acres of which\r\nare so far declared government property.\r\n\r\nThe British territory is divided into three presidencies (Madras, Bombay\r\nand Bengal) and nine provinces, each with a separate government under a\r\ngovernor, or commissioner, with a council, and all subject to control by\r\nthe resident governor-general or viceroy and his council, and he in turn\r\nis responsible to the Secretary of State at home.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, little centralization of government functions, the\r\nprovincial governments being to a large degree at least semi-autonomous,\r\nlike the states in the United States, and considerable variation exists\r\nin the conduct of affairs. The difficulties in introducing something\r\nlike a uniform forest policy were, indeed, not small, and much credit is\r\ndue to the wisdom and tact of the three German foresters, who in\r\nsuccession filled the difficult position of head of the Imperial Forest\r\nDepartment and organized the service--Brandis, Schlich and Ribbentrop.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Forest Conditions._\r\n\r\nIn the tropics, rainfall conditions more than any other factor determine\r\nforest conditions. The rains of India depend on extraordinary sea winds,\r\nor “monsoons,” and their distribution is regulated by the topography of\r\nland and relative position of any district with regard to the mountains\r\nand the vapor-laden air currents. Thus excessive rainfall characterizes\r\nthe coast line along the Arabian Sea to about latitude 20 degrees N.,\r\nand still more along the coast of Lower Burma, and to a lesser extent\r\nalso the delta of the Ganges and the southern slopes of the Himalayas. A\r\nmoderately humid climate, if gauged by annual rainfall, prevails over\r\nthe plateau occupying the larger part of the peninsula and the lower\r\nGanges valley, while a rainfall of less than 15 inches occurs over the\r\narid regions of the lower Indus.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall, so unevenly distributed territorially, is, moreover, as\r\nunevenly distributed through the year. In most districts the principal\r\nrains are experienced in summer, the rainy season being followed by a\r\nlong dry season. But on the Eastern coast the summer rains are slight,\r\nand the principal rainy season is delayed into October and November,\r\nwhile in Northern India and the Himalayas, also winter rains occur,\r\nirregular and of short duration.\r\n\r\nEven where a relatively large rainfall prevails, the climate is dry on\r\naccount of the high temperature, hence some 30,000,000 acres of the\r\ncultivated acreage (which comprises 225,000,000 acres in all) depend on\r\nirrigation, over half of this irrigated area lying in the tropical zone.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, at least four climatic zones with many sub-types, may\r\nbe recognized: the truly tropic, intensely hot and wet (over 75 inch\r\nrainfall), prevailing on the plains and tablelands of the lower half of\r\nthe peninsula; the hot and dry (below 15 inch rainfall) climate of the\r\nNorthwestern Indus plain and plateau; the moderately warm and dry to\r\nhumid (30-75 inch rainfall) climate of the Ganges plain and central\r\nplateau; and the temperate to alpine, humid climate of the Himalaya\r\nmountains, with snow and ice in winter, and moderate heat in summer.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with this great diversity of climate, both as to temperature\r\nand humidity, there is a great variation in the character and\r\ndevelopment of the forest cover. At least six types can be recognized,\r\nnamely the evergreen forest, found along the West coast, in Burma,\r\nAndaman Islands, and the sub-Himalaya zone, which is composed of\r\nbroadleaved species with a dense undergrowth of small trees and tangled\r\nlianas (vines), but few shrubs, as is characteristic of most tropical\r\nforest; the deciduous forest, mainly in the interior of Central India,\r\nwith Sal, Teak and Ironwood as characteristic trees; the arid region\r\nforest, found in the Punjab, in Raiputana, and in Sindh, of varying\r\ncomposition, from the open shrub forests of the latter province,\r\ncomposed of acacias, tamarisk and mesquite, to the denser, more\r\ndiversified, dry, low tree forest of the former; the alpine coniferous\r\nforest of the Himalayas and of the mountains of Afghanistan,\r\nBelutchistan, and Burma, composed of pine, deodar, juniper, with oak,\r\nwalnut, boxwood, approaching our own forest types. In addition, there\r\nmay be segregated the coast forest, of small extent, composed of trees\r\nwhich, like the mangrove, will bear salt water; the overflow forest\r\nalong rivers; and river forests in the desert regions, of which latter\r\nlarge areas exist.\r\n\r\nThe natural differences in the forest cover are emphasized by the action\r\nof man, who for many centuries has waged war against the forest,\r\nclearing it permanently or temporarily for agricultural purposes, or\r\nelse merely burning it over to improve grazing facilities, or for\r\npurposes of the chase.\r\n\r\nStatistics, except of government properties, are somewhat doubtful.\r\nApparently, the forested area of the whole of India comprises somewhat\r\nover 40 per cent. of the land area. The government forests, settled and\r\nunsettled, represent at present about 24 per cent. of the area under\r\nBritish rule (149 million acres), not over 20 per cent. being under\r\ncultivation, leaving about 56 per cent. either natural desert, waste, or\r\ngrazing lands.\r\n\r\nThe great forests of India are in Burma; extensive woods clothe the\r\nfoothills of the Himalayas and are scattered in smaller bodies\r\nthroughout the more humid portions of the country, while the dry\r\nnorthwestern territories are practically treeless wastes. Large areas of\r\ndensely settled districts are so completely void of forest that millions\r\nof people regularly burn cow dung as fuel, while equally large districts\r\nare still impenetrable, wild woods, where, for want of market, it hardly\r\npays to cut even the best of timbers.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of forests in India are stocked with hardwoods, which in\r\nthese tropical countries are largely evergreen, or nearly so, although\r\nthe large areas of dry forest are deciduous by seasons; only a small\r\nportion of the forest area is covered by conifers, both pine and cedar,\r\nthese pine forests being generally restricted to higher altitudes in the\r\nHimalayas. The hardwoods, most of which in India truly deserve this\r\nname, belong to a great variety of plant families, some of the most\r\nimportant being the Leguminosæ, Verbenaceæ, Dipterocarpeæ, Combretaceæ,\r\nRubiaceæ, Ebenaceæ, Euphorbiaceæ, Myrtaceæ, and others, and a relatively\r\nsmall portion represented by Cupuliferæ and other families familiar to\r\nus. The most important, valuable species are Teak, Sal, and Deodar.\r\n\r\nIn the greater part of India the hardwood forest consists not of a few\r\nspecies, as with us, but is made up, like most tropical forest, of a\r\ngreat variety of trees unlike in their habit, their growth, and their\r\nproduct; and, if our hardwoods offer on this account considerable\r\ndifficulties to profitable exploitation, the case is far more\r\ncomplicated in India, several thousand species entering into the\r\ncomposition. In addition to the large variety of timber trees there is\r\na multitude of shrubs, twining and climbing plants, and in many forest\r\ndistricts also a growth of giant grasses (bamboos), attaining a height\r\nof 30 to 120 feet, which is ready to take possession of clearings. These\r\nbamboos, valuable as they are in many ways, prevent often for years the\r\ngrowth of any seedling trees, and thus form a serious obstacle to the\r\nregeneration of valuable timber. The growth of timber is generally quite\r\nrapid, although to attain commercial size, Teak requires usually a\r\nrotation of 150 years. But in spite of their rapid growth and the large\r\nareas now in forest capable of reforestation, India is not likely--at\r\nleast within reasonable time--to raise more timber than it needs. In\r\nmost parts of India, the use of ordinary soft woods, such as pine, seems\r\nvery restricted, for only durable woods, those resisting both fungi and\r\ninsects (of which the white ants are specially destructive), can be\r\nemployed in the more permanent structures, and are therefore acceptable\r\nin all Indian markets.\r\n\r\nAt present, Teak is the most important hardwood timber, while the Deodar\r\n(a true cedar) is the most extensively used conifer. Teak occurs in all\r\nmoist regions of India except the Himalayas, grows usually mixed with\r\nother kinds, single, or in clumps, is girdled two or three years before\r\nfelling, is generally logged in a primitive way, commonly hewn in the\r\nwoods and shipped--usually floated--as timber, round or hewn, and rarely\r\nsawn to size.\r\n\r\nIn 1905-6, the cut in the State forest area was 240,000,000 cubic feet,\r\ntimber (25%) and fuel, of which 20 per cent. was given to grantees or\r\nthose holding rights of user free of charge, and less than 2 per cent.\r\nwas exported. In addition, over 200 million bamboos and nearly two\r\nmillion dollars worth of by-products, such as lac, caoutchouc, cutch,\r\ngambier, myrobalans, were secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Property Conditions._\r\n\r\nPrior to the British occupation, the native rulers, or rajahs, laid\r\nclaim to a certain proportion of the produce from all cultivators of the\r\nsoil. They also reserved absolute right to the forests, and to all\r\nunseated or waste lands, although usually the people were allowed to\r\nsupply their needs from these. The English government, by right of\r\nconquest, fell heir to these rights as well as to the properties, but,\r\nwithout care in asserting its rights, the unimpeded use of unguarded\r\nforest property led to the assertion of rights of user by the people,\r\nand such were also sometimes granted by the government. “Joint village”\r\ncommunities in some parts, i.e., settlements which occupy contiguous\r\nareas, claimed and occupied large areas of forest and waste as commons,\r\nand in general the original property rights of the government became\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of bringing order into this question led to various\r\nso-called settlements, by which the rights were defined, properties\r\nde-limited, and payment in kind changed into cash payments.\r\n\r\nAfter attempts to regulate these matters by local rules, the first\r\ngeneral Indian Forest Act, passed in 1865, modified by the Forest Act of\r\n1878, laid down the basis upon which the rights of forest property were\r\nto be settled. These acts divide the forests into three classes, namely,\r\nthose in which the right of the State is absolute; those in which the\r\nState has property rights, but which are burdened with prescriptive or\r\ngranted rights of user; and those which are private property, but on\r\nwhich the State reserves the right to cut certain kinds of trees for\r\ngovernment use, Teak, Sandalwood, and in some parts Deodar, these being\r\nconsidered “royal trees.” The forest act being throughout applicable\r\nonly at the choice and under the construction of the provincial\r\ngovernments, modified acts, applicable to different parts of the Empire,\r\nand different in details, were passed from time to time, and many\r\ndifferent local rules were issued by the provincial governments, but all\r\nagree in fixing one definite policy, namely declaration or demarcation\r\nof government forests, after inquiry into all existing rights, and\r\ndivision of the declared government forests into three classes, reserves\r\nor permanent state forests, protected forests, and unclassed, the latter\r\ntwo still open to change in ownership, and adjustment in rights of user,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe absolute and relative areas of government property, therefore, are\r\ncontinuously changing. In 1900 the reserve forests comprised 81,400\r\nsquare miles, or 8.6% of the total territory controlled by the British\r\ngovernment; the protected forest 8800 square miles, and the demarcated\r\nbut unclassified area, 117,000 square miles. These figures had, in 1904,\r\nchanged to 91,567 for permanent reserves (58 million acres), 9865 for\r\nprotected, and 131,269 for unclassed, showing the rapid change now\r\ntaking place in the status of classification.\r\n\r\nThe name of B. H. Baden-Powell, at one time conservator of the Punjab\r\nand Acting Inspector-General of Forests during 1872-4, is closely\r\nconnected with placing this forest legislation on a sound basis. The\r\nobject of this legislation was mainly to settle the question of\r\nownership and rights, hence reserved forests are not necessarily set\r\naside for forest purposes like the forest reservations in the United\r\nStates, although ultimately this will probably be their condition.\r\n\r\nRights of user were under this legislation regulated or commuted. In\r\nsome parts, even on the reserved forest areas, there are still retained\r\nrights to cut _taungyas_, i.e., to make partial clearings for temporary\r\nagricultural use, under the restriction of not destroying teak trees\r\nover 18 inches in diameter, and with the right of the cultivators to\r\nsupply their domestic needs, under obligation to cut out fire traces,\r\nburning the brush, and instituting similar protective measures.\r\n\r\nThe title to the forest property having been secured, its permanent\r\ndemarcation and a survey of the same were the next steps; the first\r\nhaving gradually been nearly accomplished, the latter being still far in\r\narrears.\r\n\r\nThe area of private and communal forests is not precisely known, but,\r\nincluding waste land and lands of uncertain conditions, there are at\r\nleast 500,000 square miles so owned, including those of feudatory rulers\r\nwithin the provinces. Of these, some 500 square miles or more of forest\r\nare leased to the government and under its control; and in some cases\r\nforest administrations are instituted by the rajahs themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the Act of 1878, there was a clause calling for protection of private\r\nforest property against trespass and encroachment, but this remained a\r\ndead letter. By later legislation the government is entitled to exercise\r\ncontrol over private forests and lands, if it appears necessary for the\r\npublic weal, or if the treatment which such forests have received from\r\ntheir owners affect the public welfare or safety injuriously; but in\r\nsuch cases the owner can require the government to expropriate the land\r\nin question.\r\n\r\nThe forest act also provided that the government may assign to village\r\ncommunities from the reserved forest area so-called village forests, and\r\nmake rules for their protection, use and management. How far this policy\r\nhas been applied does not appear.\r\n\r\nThere are still areas the ownership of which is not settled, and rights\r\nwhich are still in doubt, the work of the so-called forest settlements\r\nstill going on, several thousand square miles being annually changed in\r\nstatus, and several thousand dollars annually spent to quiet rights of\r\nuser.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Development of Forest Policy._\r\n\r\nThrough the long history of India that preceded the arrival of the\r\nMohammedans in the 10th to 12th centuries, it appears that the forest\r\narea was only slowly encroached upon by the Hindoo civilization. Even\r\nwhen the invaders, nomads by habit, drove many of the native race into\r\nthe jungle to eke out a precarious existence, owing to the remarkable\r\nrecuperative powers of a tropical nature the impression made was not\r\npermanent. Although much forest growth was then destroyed, cleared or\r\nmutilated, changes took place only slowly.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed, that in consequence of the destruction, which was\r\nincident to the nomadic life of the Mohammedans and the shifting\r\nagriculture of the aborigines, climatic changes were produced, but the\r\nproof for this assertion has remained questionable.\r\n\r\nWhen in the 18th century the British entered India in rivalry with the\r\nFrench and other European nations, it was, of course, only for purposes\r\nof exploitation, and for a long time after the British had attained the\r\nascendancy and had subjected most of the territory now ruled by them,\r\nnot much concern was had about the forests; they furnished but small\r\nvalues, excepting in one particular, namely supplies of Teak for naval\r\npurposes. In the beginning of the 19th century the Government became\r\nconcerned regarding these supplies, which under the rough exploitation\r\nthreatened to become exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe first step towards securing some conservative management dates back\r\nto 1806, when Captain Watson was sent to India as Conservator of\r\nForests, to look after the interests of the East India Company in this\r\ndirection. His inability to compromise with those who had secured timber\r\nprivileges led to his removal and an abandonment of the office, in 1823.\r\nIneffective, sporadic efforts at administration by the provincial\r\ngovernments then followed.\r\n\r\nIn 1839-40, the government of the Bombay Presidency stopped the cutting\r\nof Teak trees on government property. In 1834, M. Connolly, Collector of\r\nMalabar in the Madras Presidency, began to plant Teak on a large scale\r\nat Nilambur. In 1847, Dr. Gibson was appointed Conservator of Forests in\r\nBombay; from 1848 to 1856, Lieutenant (now General, C. S. I.) James\r\nMichael conducted the government timber operations in the Anamalai Teak\r\nforests (Madras), and made the first recorded attempts to protect Indian\r\nforests from injury by annual jungle fires.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, Dr. Hugh Cleghorn was appointed Conservator of Forests in\r\nMadras. He checked the destructive practices of temporary cultivation in\r\nthe government forests of that Presidency, a measure, which at first was\r\nstrongly opposed by the people, but his well-known desire to promote\r\nnative interests inspired the rulers of the country with confidence, and\r\nfinally his measures were successful.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts at some kind of regulation of the exploitation by\r\nlumbermen were also made by the general government, after various\r\nexaminations and reports, and, in 1847, even a small and ineffective\r\nforest department was organized.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of the Province of Pegu in lower Burma, in 1852,\r\nintroduced a new complication, and proved the turning point in forestry\r\nmatters. In this province, the right to cut Teak had been reserved by\r\nthe native princes, and hence became a right of the crown, but private\r\nlumbermen began to cut this timber, and, after an investigation and\r\nreport, it was decided to take definite steps to regulate the use of\r\nthese valuable Teak forests at least.\r\n\r\nLord Dalhousie, the then Governor-General, upon the basis of the report\r\nof the superintendent of forests at Pegu, Dr. McClelland, in 1855 laid\r\ndown in statesmanlike manner an outline of a permanent forest policy for\r\nthe government, and introduced the first professional adviser.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, a German forester from Hesse, Dietrich Brandis (afterward Sir)\r\nwas installed as superintendent of forests for Pegu with wide powers\r\nunder contract for 10 years, at a liberal salary, and pension after\r\nretirement. The only possible check that could at first be applied was\r\nto force the lumbermen to make contracts, limit the diameter to which\r\nthe exploitation was to be allowed, and mark the trees to be felled.\r\nThis was done, naturally not without a large amount of friction.\r\n\r\nThe result of this experiment in forest conservancy, as the English are\r\npleased to call it, was so satisfactory, that, in 1862, it was decided\r\nto organize a forest department for all India; Brandis was entrusted\r\nwith the organization, and, in 1864, he was appointed head of the new\r\ndepartment under the Secretary of Public Works with the title of\r\nInspector-General, acting as adviser of the various provincial\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nThe forests of India during the next 20 years during which Brandis held\r\noffice, were, province by province, brought under the regime of the\r\nImperial Forest Department, although the provincial governments retain\r\nfull and independent administrative power.\r\n\r\nThe first problem was to settle ownership conditions, which was done in\r\nthe manner described before, by the act of 1865, and by later acts.\r\n\r\nThe discontent which was created by this act came very near wrecking the\r\nwhole enterprise, and much difference of opinion between the local and\r\ngeneral governments existed, the government of Madras going so far as to\r\ndeclare the impossibility of establishing State property in view of the\r\nacknowledged rights of the villagers over waste lands. The general\r\npolicy, however, finally prevailed, and an increasingly harmonious\r\ncooperation of the provincial governments has allowed the development of\r\nan efficient forest service.\r\n\r\nVarious provincial legislation was considered, passed and repealed,\r\nuntil, in 1878, the Indian Forest Act VII settled the policy at least\r\nfor the majority of the provinces, Madras and Burma and some minor\r\ndistricts still declining to extend its provisions to their forests. The\r\nBurma government enacted, however, similar legislation in 1881, and the\r\nMadras government in 1882, and, much later, the other outstanding\r\ngovernments followed (1886 to 1891), so that, while the detail of\r\napplication varies not inconsiderably, the general policy regarding\r\nforest property of the State is the same throughout the empire. Whatever\r\nof uniformity exists had to be secured mainly by persuasive means.\r\n\r\nThe forest acts, as stated on a previous page, contain certain\r\nprovisions regarding formation of village forests and control of private\r\nforest property, but no interference with private forest property has\r\nbeen attempted, although in some parts this is more important and larger\r\nthan the State holdings. Most of the owners merely exploit their\r\nproperty, but some of the larger, more enlightened native princes have\r\nestablished forest administrations, imitating the example of the\r\nImperial government. Those of Mysore and Kashmir and Hyderabad have\r\nplaced this administration under an imperial forest officer, furloughed\r\nfor this purpose, and derive handsome revenues; the Kashmir forests of\r\nabout 2500 square miles yielding round $180,000; those of Mysore, near\r\n2000 square miles, over $330,000, this largely derived from sales of\r\nsandal wood; those of the Nizam of Hyderabad, with 5200 square miles in\r\nreserves and 4400 in protected forests, deriving a revenue of $75,000,\r\nseven times what it was ten years before.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Forest Organization and Administration._\r\n\r\nThe condition of affairs in the forest department can be briefly\r\nsummarized as follows for the year 1909.\r\n\r\nTotal area under government control: 241,774 square miles, namely,\r\nReserved, 94,561; Protected, 8,835; Unclassed, 138,378.\r\n\r\nOfficials (in 1905): Higher grades, 312; Lower grades, 1,663; Guards,\r\n8,533. The controlling staff was in 1909 increased by 34; and numbers in\r\nall other grades increased.\r\n\r\nRounded off Expenditures, $4,500,000; Revenues, $8,225,000; Net\r\nProceeds, $3,675,000 (45% of gross). Variation in the value of the rupee\r\nmakes comparison with earlier years uncertain.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the many difficulties, a poor market (no market at all for a\r\nlarge number of woods), wild, unsurveyed, and practically unknown\r\nwoodlands, requiring unusual and costly methods of organization and\r\nprotection, the forestry department has succeeded, without curtailing\r\nthe timber output of India, in so regulating forest exploitation as to\r\ninsure not only a permanence in the output, but also to improve the\r\nwoodlands by favoring the valuable species. It has prepared for an\r\nincrease of output for the future, and at the same time has yielded the\r\nGovernment a steadily growing revenue, which bids fair to rank before\r\nlong among the important sources of income.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 the net revenue was only $360,000, it had about doubled by 1875,\r\nand more than trebled by 1885, and since then has more than quadrupled.\r\n\r\nWhile in the period of 1870 to 1874 the expense of the administration\r\nwas still 70 per cent. of the gross income, it has gradually been\r\nreduced to near 45 per cent., while the outturn in material has in the\r\nlast five years increased by 35% over the preceding quinquennium.\r\n\r\nAt first, the department and its operations as well as its finances were\r\nImperial, the local governments having no control over its officers or\r\nover the revenue derived, but, in 1882, decentralization was effected,\r\nthe local governments obtaining a direct interest in the revenues. As a\r\nresult the financial interest overruled the conservative policy, and\r\nover-cutting was the consequence. In 1884, the general government\r\nrecognized the need of a change. After some struggle, the Imperial\r\ndepartment was placed at least in charge of preparing the working plans,\r\nand pressure for their execution if not direct enforcement can be\r\nbrought through appeal to the general government by the\r\nInspector-General, which, however, has never been necessary to use.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the forest service passed through various stages,\r\nand the arrangement in the different provinces is even now not quite\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nThe forest service, then, is peculiarly organized as regards division of\r\nresponsibilities and relationships between the imperial and the\r\nprovincial governments, the autonomy of the latter being jealously\r\nguarded. It is divided into the Imperial and the Provincial Service, the\r\nformer consisting of the higher grade officials entirely recruited from\r\nEngland, the latter, the executive service, being in administrative\r\nfunctions independent of the former.\r\n\r\nAn Inspector-General, directly under the Secretary of Revenue and\r\nAgriculture, (for some time under the Home Department) is the head of\r\nthe service, and acts as professional adviser both of the Imperial and\r\nthe Provincial Governments. But this head of the service is shorn of\r\nmost of executive functions, all administrative matters being reserved\r\nto the provincial authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Inspector-General has charge only of the forest school\r\nadministration, of forest surveys, and of the making of working plans,\r\nwhich later, after approval by the Provincial government, are in their\r\nexecution inspected and critically supervised by him, but without power\r\nto enforce them, or to give direction directly to the Conservators in\r\ncharge (at least in Madras and Burma). He also watches over and reports\r\non the progress of all forestry matters in the empire.\r\n\r\nPeculiarities and great variety are also found in other official\r\nrelations and in the appointing power, the general and provincial\r\ngovernments exercising certain rights in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe Controlling Staff (57 officers in 1869, now about 300) under the\r\nInspector-General, consists of Conservators, Deputy Conservators and\r\nAssistant Conservators. The Conservators, now some 20, so far as they\r\nare not directly acting as assistants in the Inspector-General’s\r\noffice, are the heads of the provincial departments and\r\nconservatorships, and in that capacity directly subordinate to the local\r\ngovernment, which in Madras and Bombay also has their appointment; each\r\nis in charge either of the entire forest business of the Province, or of\r\na circle forming part of a Province and the administration unit in\r\nIndia. These are, therefore, the most influential and most responsible\r\nagents in introducing forestry practices. Conservatorships are divided\r\ninto divisions, each in charge of a divisional forest officer, a member\r\nof either the Imperial or the Provincial Controlling Staff; but these\r\nhave to acknowledge subordination to the Chief Civil officer, the\r\nCollector of the district in which they are located, in order to\r\nharmonize the financial and forestal interests.\r\n\r\nAbout 80 per cent. of the Controlling Staff in the Imperial Service are\r\nappointed by the Secretary of State from graduates formerly from the\r\nforest school at Cooper’s Hill College, now Oxford, the remaining 20 per\r\ncent. from Englishmen in the provincial service, the members of which\r\nhave passed through the Dehra Dun forest school and through the lower\r\nbranches of the service. In addition to this Superior Staff, a\r\nSubordinate Staff of Extra Deputy Conservators and Extra Assistant\r\nConservators forms the Provincial Service, which is mainly recruited\r\nfrom the natives.\r\n\r\nThe districts are divided into ranges, for which an Executive Service is\r\norganized, of rangers (over 400), who are now selected from graduates of\r\nthe forest school in Dehra Dun. Deputy rangers and foresters, a lower\r\ngrade (some 1700), and guards, having their separate beats (over 8500),\r\nform the Protective Service, mostly or all recruited from the better\r\nclass of natives.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Forest Treatment._\r\n\r\nWith the irregular distribution of forests, the peculiarities of Indian\r\ngovernment affairs and population, and the wild and difficult forest\r\nconditions themselves, it is but natural that the work thus far has been\r\nchiefly one of organization, survey, and protection.\r\n\r\nIn the protection against unlawful felling or timber stealing and\r\ngrazing, the Government of India has shown itself fully equal to the\r\noccasion by a liberal policy of supplying villagers in proximity of the\r\nforests with fuel, building material, pasture, etc., at reduced prices\r\nor gratis. Over $1,500,000 worth is thus disposed of annually, the\r\nincentive to timber stealing being thereby materially reduced. A\r\nreasonable and just permit system for grazing, where again the needs of\r\nthe neighboring villagers are most carefully considered, not only brings\r\nthe government a yearly revenue of over $800,000, but enables the people\r\nto pasture about 14,000,000 head of animals in the State forests without\r\ndoing any material damage to tree growth. Thirty-one per cent. of the\r\ntotal forest area is open to grazing.\r\n\r\nThe work of preventing and fighting fires can with the means available\r\nnot be carried on over the entire forest area, of which large tracts are\r\nnot even crossed by a footpath, and in a land where the regular firing\r\nof the woods has become the custom of centuries, and where, in addition,\r\nintensely hot and dry weather, together with a most luxuriant growth of\r\ngiant grasses, render these jungle fires practically unmanageable. Each\r\nyear, however, additional territory is brought under protection. In\r\n1902, nearly 37,000 square miles, or nearly 40% of the area in reserve,\r\nbut only 12% of the total government forest area, were under protection\r\nat a cost of $4.00 per square mile or less than one cent per acre, half\r\nof what it was 10 years before, and over 2 per cent. of the gross\r\nrevenue. Nearly 5,000 fires occurred, to be sure, which burnt over\r\n3,000,000 acres, that is to say over 90 per cent. of the area the\r\nprotection was effective. For nearly half the fires the cause remains\r\nunknown. Danger from fire has, however, become less in protected areas\r\nbecause of the changes in herbage and moisture conditions. Yet it costs\r\nstill about two per cent. of the gross revenue to protect the area, and\r\nthe figures just cited show that this expenditure is only partially\r\neffective. In 1909, the protected area had increased to 43,000 square\r\nmiles, the cost to $5, the efficiency to 94 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe first successful attempts to deal with forest fires were made in\r\n1864 by Major (later Colonel) G. F. Pearson, who was then Conservator of\r\nForests in the Central Provinces, and who devised a system of cleared\r\nfire lines or “fire traces,” surrounding the areas to be protected,\r\nwhich were cut and burned over early in the season, a system now in\r\nvogue in all India. In the jungle forests the traces must be broad; the\r\ngrass often taller than an elephant must be cut and burned before the\r\ngrass on either side of the fire lane is dry enough to burn.\r\n\r\nThis protection forms the most important duty of the forest officials,\r\na trying one as it has to be carried on during the hot season.\r\n\r\nA separate branch of the forest service carried on the work of surveying\r\nand mapping the forest area instead of the regular Survey of India, with\r\nthe result of cheapening the cost. Some 74,000 square miles had been\r\nmapped on the scale of 4 inch to the mile, the standard, some smaller\r\nareas on smaller scale, at the rate of $25 per square mile. In 1908,\r\nhowever, this work was handed over to the Survey.\r\n\r\n_Silviculture._ Silvicultural practices are naturally but little\r\ndeveloped. Protection against fire, grazing, overcutting has been the\r\nfirst requisite. The unregulated selection system with a diameter limit,\r\nwhich Brandis introduced, still prevails mostly, although beginnings of\r\na compartment and group system in converting miscarried selection forest\r\nof Deodar, Pine and Sal have been made, or rather of an improved\r\nselection method, which seeks to secure reproduction in groups.\r\nClearcutting with seed trees held over is practised in the coniferous\r\nmountain forest. Coppice and coppice with standards (reserves of\r\nsprouts) is a natural condition over large areas, especially with Teak\r\nand Sal. Even improvement cuttings or sowing on barren hillsides with\r\nremarkable success, are not absent.\r\n\r\nThe attempts at securing reproduction, especially in the truly tropic\r\nforests have often miscarried, inferior species filling the openings.\r\nGirdling of inferior species to favor the better classes has hardly had\r\nthe desired result. In the deciduous forest, the same difficulty of\r\nundesirable aftergrowth is experienced, deteriorating the composition,\r\nexcept in the case of the gregarious Sal tree (_Shorea robusta_), the\r\ntreatment of which for reproduction has, after many failures, been well\r\nestablished. Other gregarious species also can be satisfactorily\r\nreproduced. The culled and burned-over forests, of which, there are\r\nmany, are re-habilitated in a manner by merely removing the old\r\novermature and defective timber, with comparative success.\r\n\r\nIn some parts, the large gregarious bamboos are a serious obstacle to\r\nreproduction. Here, the only chance for reproduction exists when they\r\nflower and die. Killing the bamboos by cutting the annual shoots proved\r\na failure, but burning over the whole area and sowing seems to be\r\nfollowed by success.\r\n\r\nIn other parts, as in the large Teak forests of Burma, as well as of\r\nother provinces, the useless kinds of trees are girdled, huge climbers\r\nare cut off, and a steady war is waged against all species detrimental\r\nto teak regeneration with satisfactory results. With Teak, even planting\r\non a larger scale is resorted to, especially by means of _taungyas_,\r\ni.e. plantations, where the native is allowed to burn down a piece of\r\nwoods, use it for a few years as field (though it is never really\r\ncleared) on condition of planting it with teak, being paid a certain sum\r\nfor every hundred trees found in a thrifty condition at the time of\r\ngiving up his land. Similarly, the department has expended large sums in\r\nattempting to establish forests in parts of the arid region of\r\nBeluchistan, and, on the whole, during 1894-95 about $150,000 were\r\nexpended on cultural operations, which up to that time involved about\r\n76,000 acres of regular plantations and 36,000 acres _taungyas_ (mostly\r\nteak,) making a total of 112,000 acres, besides numerous large areas\r\nwhere the work consisted merely in aiding natural reproduction.\r\n\r\nBut, in 1909, the plantations seem to have been reduced to 59,000 acres,\r\n(probably through failures), the taungyas however increased to 84,000\r\nacres, and the budget for plantings and other cultural measures formed a\r\nlittle over two per cent. of the gross revenues.\r\n\r\nWe see then, that though the forests of India are now, and will continue\r\nfor some time to be little more than wild woods with some protection and\r\na reasonable system of exploitation in place of a mere robbing or\r\nculling system, yet the work of actual improvement steadily increases in\r\namount and perfection.\r\n\r\nIn disposing of its timber the Government of India employs various\r\nmethods. In some of the forest districts the people pay merely a small\r\ntax and get out of the woods what and as much as they need. In other\r\ncases, the logger pays for what he removes, the amount he fells being\r\nneither limited in quantity nor quality. The prevalent systems, however,\r\nare the permit system, when a permit is issued indicating the amount to\r\nbe cut and the price to be paid for the same, and the contract system,\r\nwhen the work is more or less under the control of government officers\r\nand the material remains government property until paid for. To a\r\nlimited extent the governments carry on their own timber exploitation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Working Plans._ Only a relatively small part of the total forest area,\r\neach year, however, increasing, is as yet worked under plans. In 1885,\r\nonly 109 square miles, in 1899, 20,000 square miles, and in 1903, nearly\r\n30,000 square miles, about 13 per cent. of the total, or 30 per cent. of\r\nthe reserved area, were operated under working plans, and each year\r\nabout 4000 square miles are added, so that now (1909) over half the\r\nreserved area is under working plans.\r\n\r\nOnly gradually was the character of these plans brought into practical\r\nform, and their execution, in spirit at least, enforced, the\r\nConservators having the right to deviate from the plans.\r\n\r\nA map, prepared by the survey branch naturally forms the basis of the\r\nplan. The form of the plan is prescribed by the provincial regulations,\r\nand the preparation is also carried on by the provincial service under\r\nadvice and supervision of the imperial department. The “strip valuation\r\nsurvey,” which Brandis introduced, covering sometimes as much as 30 per\r\ncent. of the area, is employed in determining number of trees and sizes,\r\ngrowing stock and cut, modeled after the European practice, except that\r\nlittle, perhaps too little, money is spent on their elaboration,\r\nespecially on determining the proper amount of cut. That the cut is\r\ncontrolled at all is the most important result.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Education and Literature._\r\n\r\nIn 1866, Sir Dietrich Brandis selected as assistants two young men who\r\nhad been trained in the forest schools of Germany--in turn his\r\nsuccessors--and at the same time arrangements were made for the training\r\nof young Englishmen in the Forest schools of France and Germany. At the\r\nend of 1875 the professional education was entirely transferred to\r\nNancy. The present force of Conservators is composed largely of these\r\nmen. For some reason, the training of men in Germany and France became\r\nunpopular, and this objection finally led, in 1884, to the establishment\r\nof a chair of forestry at Cooper’s Hill College for Engineering in\r\nEngland. At first, the course of study extended over 26 months, during\r\n22 of which the candidates prosecuted their studies at the college; the\r\nremaining four months being spent under suitable supervision in selected\r\nBritish and Continental forests.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, this department was transferred to Oxford University and the\r\ncourse extended to three years, one year to be spent in continental\r\nforests. At present this time may, however, be reduced to two years and\r\nthe vacations in continental forests. This is a government affair, and\r\nprobationers receive stipends from the government.\r\n\r\nMr. Brandis as early as 1869 saw also the necessity of providing the\r\nmeans of giving the natives of India some sort of technical education in\r\nforestry. The first step in this direction was to place natives,\r\nselected ones, under one or two officers of the Imperial Service who\r\nwere deemed fit to instruct them, and in this way a few good men were\r\nturned out. Another experiment, after the German pattern, was made by\r\napprenticing likely young men under some forester for a year or two and\r\nthen sending them to an engineering school for theoretical instruction.\r\nThis was also a failure. After much hard work, the Indian forest school\r\nat Dehra Dun was established in 1878, the forests between the Jumna and\r\nthe Ganges rivers were set aside as training grounds, formed into a\r\nspecial Forest Circle and placed under the control of the director of\r\nthe school. These forests have been subjected to regular systems of\r\nmanagement, based on European experience, and excellent results have\r\nbeen obtained. The first course of systematic theoretical instruction\r\nwas opened on the 1st of July, 1881. In 1884 the school was made an\r\nimperial institution by the Government of India, and the\r\nInspector-General of Forests was charged with its supervision, under a\r\nBoard of Control, consisting of the Inspector-General, the Director, and\r\nthree Conservators, with the Assistant Inspector-General as secretary.\r\nThis board meets once a year at Dehra, conducts the examinations, and\r\nlooks into all of the workings of the School very carefully. There were\r\ntwo courses--one in which the teaching was given in English for rangers,\r\nthe other in which the instruction was given in the vernacular for\r\nforesters; courses extending over 24 months. In 1906 the school was\r\nraised to the rank of a college and the course in the vernacular\r\nabolished. The graduates may aspire to the rank of division officers.\r\nThe training of lower grade officers is left to the provinces. The\r\nBombay Presidency had for some time their own forest school in\r\nconnection with the Engineering College at Poona, but this is now\r\nabandoned. Another school, however, is located at Tharrawaddy, with a\r\ntwo-year course in Burmese, and one in Madras with a one-year course; so\r\nthat the education of lower grade officials is well attended to.\r\n\r\nForest Experiment and Investigations have never been systematically\r\ninstituted, being left to individual initiative, but lately (1909)\r\nprovision has been made in this direction in connection with the Dehra\r\nDun school by the establishment of an Imperial Research Institute.\r\n\r\nBesides a monthly journal, the Indian Forester which came into existence\r\nin 1875 through Schlich’s initiative, and the annual reports of the\r\nvarious conservators and of the Inspector-General, a small book\r\nliterature has developed within the last ten or fifteen years.\r\n\r\nDescriptive volumes of note are J. S. Gamble’s _Manual of Indian\r\nTimbers_, new edition, 1902; _Trees, Shrubs and Woody Climbers of Bombay\r\nPresidency_ by W. A. Talbot, 1902; Ribbentrop’s _Forestry in British\r\nIndia_, 1900, and the earlier publication of H. R. Morgan, _Forestry in\r\nSouthern India_; Brandis’ _Indian Forestry and Distribution of Forests\r\nin India_. Of professional interest are E. E. Fernandez _Manual of\r\nIndian Silviculture_, unfortunately out of print; the same author’s\r\n_Forest Industries_; D’Arcy’s _Manual of Forest Working Plans_; C. C.\r\nRoger’s _Manual of Forest Engineering in India_, and B. H. Baden-Powell,\r\n_Forest Law_.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the development of the Indian Forest Service on the\r\nforest policy of other British colonies and of the home country has been\r\nconsiderable and is growing, Indian forest officers being detailed to\r\nassist in developing forest policies in these other parts of the British\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADA.\r\n\r\n  _Report on the Forest Wealth of Canada_, by the Statistician of the\r\n  Department of Agriculture, 1895.\r\n\r\n  Reports of Crown Lands Departments, of Bureau of Forestry of\r\n  Ontario, and of Forestry Branch of the Dominion.\r\n\r\n  DEFEBAUGH’S _History of the Lumber Industry of America_, Vol. I,\r\n  1906, brings together much information on this phase of the subject.\r\n\r\n  HOUGH’S _Report on Forestry_, Vol. II, 1880, has a compilation of\r\n  earlier statistics.\r\n\r\n  _An Analysis of Canada’s Timber Wealth_, by B. E. FERNOW, in\r\n  Forestry Quarterly, Vol. VI, 1908, attempts a differentiation of\r\n  commercial forest areas.\r\n\r\nThe largest single colony of Great Britain and the most important as\r\nregards forest supplies, both as to quantity and character, Canada has\r\nbeen for a long time supplying the mother country with a large\r\nproportion of her imports.\r\n\r\nAlthough in size larger than the United States, its land area being\r\nestimated at over 3,600,000 square miles, Canada has so far attained\r\nonly one-fifteenth of the population of her neighbor, namely less than 7\r\nmillion, although now rapidly growing. Much of her territory is still\r\nunknown, and will remain for a long time unavailable for civilization\r\nowing to its inhospitable climate. Indeed, as yet not one-third of its\r\nterritory may be considered opened up to civilization, and not much more\r\nthan 100,000 square miles can be said to be occupied, one-half improved\r\nin farms, and two-thirds of this in crops.\r\n\r\nMuch of the northern country remains unorganized and the vast North West\r\nTerritory (2,656,000 square miles) between Hudson’s Bay and the Rocky\r\nMountains, as well as Labrador, are for the most part uninhabited except\r\nby Indians and a few military and trading posts.\r\n\r\nThe central interior region, dotted with lakes and intricate river\r\nsystems, is a continuation of the forestless arid and subarid, plains\r\nand prairies of the country West of the Mississippi River, toward the\r\nnorth changing by steps into lowlands studded with open treegrowth, and\r\nbarren tundra frozen all the year, a million square miles answering to\r\nthis last description. The Pacific Slope is a rough and lofty mountain\r\ncountry, the extension of the Rockies and Coast Ranges, with a variable,\r\nin part humid and temperate, in part dry and rigorous climate, more or\r\nless heavily wooded, about 600,000 square miles, with the Fraser River\r\nin the South forming the most important drainage basin.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic portion, south of the plateau-like, bare, or scantily\r\nwooded Hudson Bay and Labrador country, with a climate, somewhat similar\r\nto North Eastern Germany, is formed by the slopes of the watersheds of\r\nthe Great Lakes and of their mighty outlet, the St. Lawrence River and\r\nits Gulf; the slopes rising gradually northward to the low range of the\r\nHeight of Land, a plateau with low hills, not over 1500 feet elevation,\r\nwhich cuts it off from the northern country and forms the limit of\r\ncommercial forest. This region, the bulk of the provinces of Ontario and\r\nQuebec--a belt of not exceeding 300 miles in width and about 1500 miles\r\nin length, altogether 300,000 square miles--with 93,000 square miles in\r\nthe maritime provinces, around 250 million acres in all, represents,\r\noutside of British Columbia, the true forest region of Canada, and at\r\nthe same time the centre of Canadian civilization.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Cabot brothers discovered Cape Breton and Labrador in 1497\r\nand 1500, the first settlement of Canadian territory was not made until\r\n1541 by French colonists, after the first Captain-General of Canada,\r\nJacques Cartier, the discoverer and explorer of the St. Lawrence (in\r\n1534), had taken possession of the country for Francis I; but not much\r\nprogress in colonizing was made until Champlain’s arrival in the first\r\nyears of the next century. Quebec was founded as early as 1608, and\r\nMontreal in 1611, but Ottawa dates its first beginnings not farther back\r\nthan 1800.\r\n\r\nThe northern country around Hudson’s Bay was, under the name of Rupert’s\r\nLand (after Prince Rupert, the head of the enterprise), undefined in\r\nlimits, granted by Charles II, in 1670, to the Hudson’s Bay Company, a\r\npowerful fur-trading corporation which had not only a commercial\r\nmonopoly but, except for occasional interference by the French, held\r\nabsolute governmental sway over the country through 200 years, its\r\njurisdiction at one time extending to the Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\nFriction and warfare with the English resulted in the latter acquiring\r\nby the treaty of Utrecht in 1713, Newfoundland, and settling their\r\nrights on Hudson’s Bay. The final conquest of “New France” by the\r\nEnglish ended French rule in 1763, but the French colonists remained\r\npeacefully, and their descendants form to-day, at least in Quebec, the\r\npredominating influence. Indeed, in 1774, by the so-called Quebec Act,\r\nthe first permanent system of self government was established much on\r\nthe lines of the French feudal system, and the French civil law was\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nAt first, under English rule, the territory, then including the States\r\nof Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, formed\r\none colony, but after the war of the Revolution, in 1791, the territory\r\nremaining English was divided into two separately governed provinces,\r\nUpper and Lower, or West and East Canada. They were re-united in 1840,\r\nand continued so until 1867 when the so-called Union or British North\r\nAmerica Act effected the present organization of the Dominion of Canada,\r\na federal union, comprising only the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New\r\nBrunswick and Nova Scotia. After various combinations and subdivisions\r\nall of the British Possessions in North America, except Newfoundland and\r\nits dependencies in Labrador, came into the union, and, in 1882, the\r\nunion was completed with the then seven provinces (those mentioned with\r\nPrince Edward Island, Manitoba and British Columbia) and all the\r\norganized and unorganized territory.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, four territories, Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta\r\nand Athabasca, in 1895 the territory of Ungava in Labrador, and in 1898\r\nthat of Yukon were organized, with a view of their eventual elevation\r\ninto provinces, the relationships of the federation being quite similar\r\nto that of the states and territories in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, the Western territories were organized into two provinces,\r\nSaskatchewan and Alberta.\r\n\r\nThe government, although practically much like a republic and largely\r\nindependent of the home country, is theoretically a limited monarchy,\r\nthe king being represented by a Governor-General, appointed by the\r\nking, and a privy council selected by the governor. The latter also\r\nappoints (now 81) senators for life to form the upper house of the\r\nParliament or legislative body, while the lower House of Commons is\r\nelected by the people. Besides this imperial government, each province\r\nhas its own separate government with a lieutenant-governor, appointed by\r\nthe Governor-General, and an elected legislature; this autonomy being\r\nsomewhat similar to that of the states of the United States and the\r\ndivision of functions between federal and provincial governments being\r\nalso similar.\r\n\r\nAlthough the home government retains the veto power, the supreme\r\njurisdiction and various other powers, and although apparently, by the\r\nappointment of officials, its influence is guarded, practically the\r\nparty management as exercised in Great Britain prevails, and\r\nindependence from imperial influence and from the home government is\r\ncontinually increasing. In regard to the crownlands, including forests,\r\nthis division as well as this relationship becomes important. Each\r\nprovincial government except those of the three middle provinces\r\nadministers the crownlands within its boundaries in its own way, yet on\r\nsimilar lines, while the Dominion government controls only the lands\r\nlocated outside of the provinces together with those of the middle\r\nprovinces and the so-called railway belt in British Columbia. These\r\nlatter lands were mostly acquired by purchase from the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany, the Company relinquishing its territorial rights in 1868, and\r\nthe transfer being completed in 1870 upon payment of £300,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Forest Conditions._\r\n\r\nThe forest area has at various times and by various authorities been\r\nroughly estimated as between one and a quarter and over one and three\r\nquarter million square miles, which would make the forest per cent. at\r\nleast over 32. But this includes the open woodlands of the northern\r\nterritory and of the prairies, which, while of great importance to the\r\nlocal settlers, are for the most part probably or surely not of\r\ncommercial value. Commercially valuable forests, actually or\r\nprospectively, are found almost only in British Columbia and in the old\r\nprovinces, the two forest regions separated, just as in the United\r\nStates, by a forestless region, except that north of the prairie region\r\na continuous belt of open woodland extends to near the mouth of the\r\nMackenzie River. A careful examination of the sources of information has\r\nled the writer to the conclusion that less than 350,000 square miles or\r\nround 200 million acres would cover fully the commercially valuable\r\nforest land, although the wooded area of the provinces in which the\r\ncommercial timber occurs is stated officially as around 450 million\r\nacres, two-fifths of which is to be found in British Columbia.\r\n\r\nIndeed, although we are accustomed to look upon Canada as a great forest\r\ncountry, it really possesses about 60 per cent. less commercial forest\r\narea than the United States, and about one-quarter of the mature timber\r\nof that country. It will be understood that all such statistics are\r\nmerely rough estimates, the data being slim, and eked out by conjectures\r\nbased on geographical conditions which predicate the character of the\r\ncountry. Most unreasonable speculations and calculations[16] as to\r\namount of timber standing and value have been made on impossible\r\nassumptions.\r\n\r\n  [16] As an instance, one statistician by mere mathematical figuring,\r\n  namely, deducting the known crop and pasture area from the total\r\n  land area would make the forest area of Quebec alone over 209\r\n  million acres. This includes the country north of the Height of\r\n  Land, of 163 million acres, which by another mathematical\r\n  calculation is made to be able to furnish over 65 billion feet of\r\n  lumber, besides over 600 million cords of pulpwood and 370 million\r\n  railroad ties; but under present conditions, owing to topography and\r\n  character of the timber it cannot be utilized and its commercial\r\n  value is altogether problematic. This calculation would leave as\r\n  really or potentially available forest land south of the Height of\r\n  Land 46 million acres in addition to over 5 million on farms. It is\r\n  claimed that this forest area may still produce some 110 billion\r\n  feet of coniferous and 1.5 billion feet of hardwoods, or 2500 feet\r\n  to the acre.\r\n\r\n  The chief of the provincial Forest Service lately made the forest\r\n  area of the province 131 million acres, including 2 million acres of\r\n  waste land.\r\n\r\nWhile by the change of standards and by local needs, forest areas may\r\nbecome commercially valuable which were not so considered before, and\r\nthereby the above figures may be eventually increased, from the\r\nstandpoint of valuable lumber supply for the world trade, the above\r\nnamed area may be assumed to set the limit for the present.\r\n\r\nA computation based on slender information has placed the country with\r\nopen woodlands in the central region as exceeding 280,000 square miles.\r\nThe Director of Forestry estimated that 150,000 square miles of this\r\narea might contain nearly 200 billion feet merchantable timber.\r\n\r\nThe southeastern territory south of the Height of Land was originally\r\nall densely wooded. From it a farm area of round 25 million acres has\r\nbeen cut out, less than 7 per cent. of the land area included.\r\nEspecially the south-western half of Ontario, between the Great Lakes,\r\nwhich contains the most fertile land, is densely settled, as also the\r\nshores of the St. Lawrence. A large part of the remaining forest area is\r\ncut over and culled, especially for pine; the amount of White Pine\r\nremaining according to estimates made in 1895 would now be less than 20\r\nbillion feet. Extensive areas have been turned into semi-barrens by\r\nrepeated fires.\r\n\r\nThe Statistician of the Dominion in his report made in that year comes\r\nto the conclusion that “the first quality pine has nearly disappeared”\r\nand that “we are within measurable distance of the time when, with the\r\nexception of spruce as to wood, and of British Columbia as to Provinces,\r\nCanada shall cease to be a wood exporting country.”\r\n\r\nThe composition in general is the same as that of the northern forest in\r\nthe United States: hardwoods (birch, maple and elm prevailing) with\r\nconifers mixed, the latter, especially spruce, becoming occasionally\r\npure. The nearly pure hardwood forest of the southern Ontario peninsula\r\nhas been almost entirely supplanted by farms, and here, even for\r\ndomestic fuel, coal, imported from the United States, is largely\r\nsubstituted for wood. Although White Pine, the most important staple is\r\nfound in all parts of this forest region, the best and largest supplies\r\nare now confined to the region north of Georgian Bay. Unopened spruce\r\nand fir lands still abound especially in Quebec on the Gaspé peninsula\r\nand northward. Spruce forms also the largest share in the composition of\r\nthe New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland forest, the pine in the\r\nfirst two provinces having practically been cut out. Extensive, almost\r\npure Balsam Fir forest, fit for pulp wood, still covers the plateau of\r\nCape Breton, while Prince Edward Island is to the extent of 60 per cent.\r\ncleared for agricultural use.\r\n\r\nMuch of this Eastern forest area is not only culled of its best timber,\r\nbut burnt over, and thereby deteriorated in its composition, the\r\ninferior Balsam Fir appearing in largest number in the reproduction.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Height of Land, in Ungava and westward, spruce continues to\r\ntimber line, but, outside of narrow belts following the river valleys,\r\nonly in open stand, branchy, and stunted, hardly fit even for pulp, for\r\nthe most part with birch and aspen intermixed. This open spruce forest,\r\ninterspersed among muskegs continues more or less to the northern tundra\r\nand across the continent to within a few miles of the mouth of the\r\nMackenzie River and the Arctic Ocean, the White Spruce being the most\r\nnorthern species. In the interior, northern prairie belt, groves of\r\naspen, dense and well developed, skirt the water courses and form an\r\nimportant wood supply.\r\n\r\nThe forests of British Columbia partake of the character of the Pacific\r\nforest of the United States, the Coast Range along the coast for about\r\n200 miles being stocked with conifers of magnificent development,\r\nDouglas Fir, Giant Arborvitæ, Hemlock, Bull Pine and a few others, the\r\nRocky Mountain range also of coniferous growth, pine and larch, but of\r\ninferior character, large areas being covered with Alpine Fir (_Abies\r\nlasiocarpa_) and Lodgepole Pine, important as soilcover and for local\r\nuse in the mining districts, but lacking in commercial value.\r\n\r\nIf much of the forest area in the settled provinces is burnt over and\r\ndamaged by forest fire, much more extensive destruction is wrought in\r\nthis northern forest by fires sweeping annually over millions of acres\r\nunchecked, many of them said to be started by lightning. About 50 per\r\ncent. of this country is said to be fire-swept.\r\n\r\nAmong the large notable forest fires the great Miramichi fire in New\r\nBrunswick in 1825 destroyed more than 6,000 square miles in a few hours.\r\nIn 1880 the loss by forest fires in the Ottawa valley alone was still\r\nestimated at $5,000,000 annually. In 1909, reports indicate over half a\r\nmillion acres burnt over in that year.\r\n\r\nThe river systems of Eastern Canada, with the mighty St. Lawrence\r\npermitting sea-going vessels to come up to Montreal, have been most\r\npotent factors in the development of the lumber industry and export\r\ntrade, without the need of railroads. Yet although, as a consequence\r\nthis trade was early developed to a relatively large figure, it has not\r\ngrown at as rapid a rate as might have been expected, and to-day with an\r\nexport in excess of imports of less than 40 million dollars is\r\nconsiderably below that of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe small export trade of earlier times, having been stimulated by\r\nexempting Canadian timber from paying duties in the home country, or at\r\nleast allowing it a preferential tariff, had by 1820 grown to 15 million\r\ncubic feet, all squared timber, and sent to England. In 1830, it had\r\ncrept up to only 20 million cubic feet, but by 1850, it amounted to over\r\n50 million cubic feet, two-fifths of which was sawed material, the 2632\r\nmills being reported by the Census (1851) as having cut 776 million feet\r\nB.M. By 1867, when the Dominion was formed, the total export of forest\r\nproducts had advanced in value to $18 million; the next decade, with a\r\nclimax year in 1873 of $26 million, saw an increase to $20 million in\r\nthe average, the proportion of sawn material being nearly three times\r\nthat of hewn wood, and the entire cut of Ontario going to the United\r\nStates. At that time it was computed that the waste of value in shipping\r\nsquare timber amounted for the province of Ontario alone still to over\r\n$350,000 annually. At present sawed lumber, deals, boards, planks, etc.,\r\nform 70 per cent. of the total export.\r\n\r\nIn the last 20 years a steady increase in exports at an average rate of\r\nabout 3 per cent. per annum is noted, the total in 1903 culminating at\r\nnearly $41 million, but in the following year sinking to 36.7 million.\r\nIn 1910, the total export amounted to $53 million, against which an\r\nimport of nearly $16 million is to be offset, nearly double what it was\r\nthree years before. Adding wood manufactures, the net export must be\r\nincreased by some $36 million. The bulk of the export goes, of course,\r\nto the United States. But, while exports of forest products thus\r\nincreased absolutely, relatively to other exports they have considerably\r\ndeclined, i.e., the lumber industry has not grown proportionally to\r\nother developments, for while, in 1868, forest products formed 34 per\r\ncent. of the total export, in 1904 they represented only about half\r\nthat figure.\r\n\r\nThe same conclusion, namely that the lumber business has not increased\r\nrapidly in the last 25 years, may be derived from the report of the\r\nDecennial Census. While, for 1890, the total cut amounted to over 5\r\nbillion feet and its value to nearly $80 million, in 1900, the cut or at\r\nleast the Census report fell below 4 billion and its value to $53\r\nmillion. In 1909, the total lumber cut was reported as 3.8 billion feet\r\nB. M. and its value $62.8 million.\r\n\r\nA measure of the depletion of the great staple White Pine is found in\r\nthe statement that from 1865 to 1893 the average size of pieces\r\ndecreased by one-quarter to one-third, and that, in 1863, over 23\r\nmillion cubic feet were exported from Quebec as against 1.5 million feet\r\nin 1904, while the price had more than quadrupled in that period. Spruce\r\nhas here taken the place of pine, and Ontario is now the main producer\r\nof pine. Yet in 1909, the White Pine cut in amount almost equaled that\r\nof spruce, and in value exceeded it by 40 per cent. Spruce, and\r\nespecially pulpwood, forms an ever increasing item in cut and export,\r\nexport of pulpwood having increased sevenfold in the last decade, to\r\nnearly $2 million, and of woodpulp to over $4 million.\r\n\r\nA notable economic improvement has taken place during the last ten or\r\nfifteen years in that the proportion of raw materials exported,\r\nespecially logs and square timber, has decreased in favor of\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\nWhile originally the home country took the bulk of exports of forest\r\nproducts, the cut of Ontario has been always, duty or no duty, sent\r\nalmost entirely to the United States. In the last six or eight years,\r\nthe export to the United States has been doubled, amounting now to about\r\nhalf of the total export, and as the States return of its own forest\r\nproducts largely in the form of manufactures to the extent of about 6\r\nmillion dollars worth, a balance of trade for the Canadian forest\r\nproduct of 12 million dollars is left.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Ownership._\r\n\r\nWhen the French took possession of the country, all the land belonged to\r\nthe king, and could be held by others only under feudal tenure, i.e., as\r\na gift under obligation of counter service. The whole country was placed\r\nas a fief under the rule of the Hundred Associates, a company which also\r\nexercised a trading and colonizing monopoly, but made no success, and\r\nwas dissolved in 1663. It was then that Richelieu introduced the system\r\nof seigniorial tenure, the land being divided into portions of from 100\r\nto 500 square miles, usually with a certain amount of river front, and\r\ngiven outright to younger noblemen, favorites of the court, and clerics,\r\nwho were, however, obligated to subgrant to colonists, thereby becoming\r\nso many immigration agents. These not only treated their colonists as\r\ntenants, exacting rent and service, but exercised nearly absolute\r\njurisdiction within their domains, the colonists becoming virtually\r\nserfs or retainers of the seigneurs. This condition continued until\r\n1854, when an adjustment of rights was formulated by the Seigneurial\r\nTenures Act, and the government aided the “habitans” to secure their\r\nfreedom by indemnifying the seigneurs, or else by paying rent, which\r\nwas done mostly.\r\n\r\nUnder English rule, the granting of lands, without, however, the\r\nseignorial rights, was continued. In 1784, such grants were made along\r\nthe St. Lawrence and the Bay of Quinte to veterans of the loyalist army,\r\nsome 20,000, in lots of 200 acres for privates up to 5,000 acres for\r\nfield officers. In 1791, every seventh section was ordered to be set\r\naside as Clergy Reserves for the support of the Protestant Church, a\r\nmeasure which created much friction, and formed, especially in the Roman\r\nCatholic province of Quebec, a chief grievance in starting the Papineau\r\nrebellion of 1837. Some 3,300,000 acres were gradually withdrawn for\r\nthis purpose, and as far as possible leased to secure an income. Some of\r\nthese lands were sold after 1827, and finally, in 1853, a statute was\r\npassed to sell the remainder and turn over the proceeds to\r\nmunicipalities for educational purposes and local improvement.\r\n\r\nExtensive grants and sales were made to lumbermen and speculators. In\r\nthis manner, by the granting of 13,000 acres to an American, Philemon\r\nWright, in 1800, the great lumber industry of Ottawa was started, and,\r\nin 1836, another American syndicate secured about a million acres of\r\ngrants. Out of the 50 million acres granted in aid of railroad\r\nconstruction, some portion must also have been in timber. By all these\r\nmethods as well as by small grants and sales to settlers a large area of\r\nuncertain extent has become private property.\r\n\r\nIn Nova Scotia, nearly the entire government domain has passed by grant\r\nand sale into private hands, some 6 million acres, one-half in small\r\nholdings. Of the lands remaining in the crown at least two-thirds is on\r\nbarrens. Similarly, in Prince Edward Island, the 800 square miles of\r\nwoodland remaining are almost wholly owned privately, the 14,000 acres\r\nof state land being, like most of the private property, stripped of its\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIn New Brunswick over 1.6 million acres, mostly woodland (containing\r\nover 10 billion feet) was granted to the railway company and another\r\nmillion acres or so is in other private possession; a liberal disposal\r\nof lands having been continued until 1883, when about 7¼ million acres\r\nof timber and waste land remained to the crown.\r\n\r\nIn Quebec some 6 million acres are estimated as privately owned, mostly\r\nin woodlots on farms. In Ontario the private woodland area of commercial\r\ncharacter may be over 5 million acres.\r\n\r\nBesides the large grants which were and still are probably to the\r\ngreatest extent in timberlands, the farms in the various provinces,\r\naccording to the Census of 1901, have from 22 to 57 per cent. in\r\nwoodlots, or altogether probably in the neighborhood of 30 million\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nThe total area privately owned may then be placed at not to exceed, say\r\n40 million acres, and the largest part of the forest area, is still\r\ncrown lands, the government of the different provinces and the Dominion\r\ngovernment in the territories and in the middle provinces administering\r\nthem and deriving the revenue therefrom. This condition has prevailed\r\nsince 1837, when the home government gave up its claim to land and\r\nrevenues.\r\n\r\nThe provincial ownership extends over about 500,000 square miles. The\r\nDominion government owns an area of 20,000 square miles in the railway\r\nbelt of British Columbia, 20 miles on each side of the railway for 500\r\nmiles, which contains good timber, and some 722,000 square miles of land\r\nin the middle provinces which contains practically only timber suitable\r\nfor local use.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Administration of Timberlands._\r\n\r\nIn the development of ownership conditions, the realization of the\r\nvaluable assets in timber growth had not been overlooked by the home\r\ngovernment, care of supplies for naval construction giving, as in the\r\nUnited States, the first incentive to a conservative forest policy.\r\n\r\nEven under the early French rule, the grants of land were made under\r\nreservation of the oak timber fit for naval use, as is evidenced from a\r\nlandgrant made in 1683. This reservation led to considerable friction as\r\nit hampered the colonists in making their clearings on the best lands.\r\nLater, the reservation was extended to include other timber needed for\r\nmilitary purposes, and when the British occupation began, these\r\nestablished rights of the crown were not only continued, but\r\nreservations of larger areas for the timber were ordered, notably around\r\nand north of Lake Champlain. In 1763, and again in 1775, the home\r\ngovernment ordered reservations to be set aside in every township.\r\n\r\nBut the great timberwealth seemed so inexhaustible that the governors\r\npaid little attention to the wise instructions of the home government\r\nfor the creation of reservations, and whatever regulations regarding the\r\ncutting of timber were made, failed to be strictly enforced. In 1789,\r\nthe policy of reserving to the crown all the timber as far as not\r\ngranted, and giving licenses to cut, was inaugurated; but not until 1826\r\nwas even the revenue feature strongly enough realized to attempt\r\nsystematically to secure the benefit of it, namely by allowing anyone to\r\ncut timber “such as was not required for the navy” who would pay a fixed\r\nrate for what was cut; a surveyor-general of woods and forests being\r\nappointed to collect the timber dues with the aid of qualified “cullers”\r\n(1811). There was even an attempt made to prevent waste by doubling the\r\nrate of timber dues on all trees cut which would not square more than 8\r\ninches; this restriction probably remained a dead letter for lack of\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nLumbermen, however, found it cheaper to buy the land, making only part\r\npayment, and after cutting the best timber, forfeiting the land;\r\ncontractors who had the monopoly for cutting the timber for the royal\r\nnavy cut also for their own account; corruption and graft pervaded the\r\nadministration, which enriched its followers with the revenues obtained\r\nfrom the timber licenses and otherwise. The strong hand which, in the\r\nabsence of a strong government, lumbermen were driven to use in order to\r\nprotect themselves from piracy by their neighbors, or else to\r\nperpetrate such, brought about many bloody conflicts. The general\r\nmaladministration of the so-called “Family Compact” besides other\r\ngrievances, caused the revolution of 1837, which, although readily put\r\ndown, led to the union of the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada in\r\n1841, and to reform of the abuses. It was then, that, after the new\r\ngovernor-general, Lord Durham’s admirable report on the situation, the\r\nhome government turned over the administration (in part at least) and\r\nrevenues of the crownlands to the several provincial governments. At\r\nthat time in New Brunswick, where a thriving export trade had been early\r\nestablished the dues on $2 million worth of production were involved,\r\nand in Quebec and Ontario the income amounted to between $200,000 and\r\n$300,000.\r\n\r\nBut even then, the immediate revenue, and not any concern for its\r\ncontinuation animated the administration of the public or crown forests.\r\nThe free-hand sales for nominal sums were changed into licenses to cut,\r\nand in order to secure larger returns these were by and by put up at\r\nauction for competitive bids, the premium or “bonus” being paid for the\r\nlimits, (i.e., a limited territory on which the holder or licensee had\r\nthe exclusive right to cut), in addition to the fixed dues or charges\r\nper unit for the timber actually cut. Later, to discourage the holding\r\nof timber limits for a rise of prices, an annual cut of first 1,000,\r\nthen 500 feet per square mile of holdings was required. To still further\r\naccelerate the use of the licenses to cut, the Crown Timber Act of 1849\r\nlimited the license to one year, and provided for an eventual limit in\r\nsize of the grants. All these provisions forced to more rapid cutting\r\nand overproduction, and depression in the lumber market was the result,\r\nthe supply in 1847 being 44 million feet to meet an export of 19\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\nNew rules were promulgated in 1851, introducing a ground rent system, a\r\nset price being paid per square mile of limit, and doubling the ground\r\nrent for unused limits each year. Needless to say, the impracticability\r\nof this geometric progression in ground rents became visible in a few\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe final present systems in the disposal of timber limits, varying in\r\ndetail, were gradually perfected in varying manner by the several\r\nprovincial governments, but they agree in general principles, in that\r\nthey grant limits for a certain time, some by the year, others by\r\nperiods, usually 21 years, during which certain conditions as to\r\nestablishment of mills and amount of manufacture without waste must be\r\nfulfilled, and a ground rent, a bonus, and timber dues for all timber\r\ncut are to be paid by the limit holder, details and prices varying and\r\nbeing changed from time to time. A diameter limit below which trees are\r\nnot to be cut also mostly prevails. Lately, sales by the thousand feet\r\nB. M. have been inaugurated in Ontario, and sale by the mile is to be\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nAs a rule licenses become negotiable and can be transferred upon paying\r\na small fee per square mile.\r\n\r\nThe governments reserving absolute rights to change conditions of this\r\ncontract at any time, the interest of the licensee is to cut as fast as\r\nhe can; other unsatisfactory conditions leading in the same direction.\r\n\r\nA Department of Crown Lands in the Dominion government and in each\r\nprovince (in Nova Scotia the Attorney-General acting as head)\r\nadministers the lands. Scalers or cullers attend to the measuring of the\r\ncut. The revenue derived by this system by all the provinces amounts now\r\nto round 4.5 million dollars per year, Ontario leading with about 20,000\r\nsquare miles now under license, (mostly pine), producing in 1910,\r\n$1,835,000; the yearly average for the decade ending 1910 was 1¾ million\r\ndollars, and some 41 million dollars have altogether accrued since 1867;\r\nQuebec, with over 70,000 square miles under license, (mostly in spruce,)\r\nproducing only about $700,000, nearly 30 million dollars having accrued\r\nduring the 43 years, or at the rate of $418 per square mile, two-thirds\r\nof which from dues.\r\n\r\nSince land for settlement is, as in the United States, obtainable by\r\nhomestead and other entries, a good many fraudulent applications under\r\nguise of settlement have curtailed the revenue, until now closer\r\nscrutiny of the fitness of land for settlement is made.\r\n\r\nThe retention of the lands by the government is naturally a feature\r\nwhich would permit and should have earlier induced conservative forestry\r\nmethods, but the immediate revenue interest has had and still has a more\r\npotent influence than considerations of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Development of Forest Policy._\r\n\r\nThe impetus to introduce conservative features seems to have largely\r\ncome through the influence of the forestry movement in the United\r\nStates, and, although, voices of prominent Canadians, like that of\r\nJames and William Little, and Sir Henry Joly de Lotbinière had been\r\nheard before in advocacy of a more far-seeing policy, the meeting of the\r\nAmerican Forestry Congress at Montreal in 1882, (see p. 480) may be set\r\nas the date of the inception of this movement in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe definite result of that meeting was the inauguration of forest fire\r\nlegislation in the various provinces. In the Province of Ontario, the\r\nFire Act of 1878, which had until then remained a dead letter, was\r\nimproved, in 1885, by inaugurating a fire ranger system, in which limit\r\nholders pay one-half the cost of the rangers. The force of fire\r\nfighters, 37 in the first year was gradually increased until, in 1910,\r\nnearly 1000 were employed at a cost of $300,000. In that year a change\r\nwas made, the whole service including inspection being charged against\r\nthe limit holder. In New Brunswick, a fire law was passed in 1885,\r\nfollowed, in 1897, by the introduction of the Ontario ranger system. In\r\n1883, Nova Scotia passed a forest fire law, which, like that of New\r\nBrunswick, remained ineffective for lack of machinery; this was not\r\nprovided until 1904, and since then has worked most satisfactorily.\r\nRecently a forest survey of this Province was made. Quebec also enacted\r\nfire legislation in 1883, but did not provide means to carry it into\r\neffect until 1889. Since at first only $5,000 annually was allowed for\r\nits execution, and by 1901-2 not more than $7,226 was expended for fire\r\nprotection over an area of 40 million acres, its effectiveness may be\r\ndoubted. But in 1905, a special Forest-Protection Branch, with a\r\nSuperintendent and a ranger system after the Ontario pattern was\r\norganized, and the service has become more effective.\r\n\r\nThe need for more organized effort and advice led to the establishment\r\nof special bureaus of forestry. In Ontario, a Clerk of Forestry was\r\nestablished in the Department of Agriculture in 1883, and, in 1895, he\r\nwas replaced by a Clerk in the Crown Lands Department, later named\r\nDirector of Forestry (Mr. Thomas Southworth). This office, later, was\r\nchanged to a Bureau of Forestry and Colonization, and a technically\r\neducated man was appointed as Provincial Forester, with a view of\r\ndeveloping a forest management, at least in the Reserves. This movement,\r\nhowever, soon collapsed for lack of appreciation; the office was\r\ntransferred back to the Department of Agriculture, which does not\r\ncontrol any timberlands, the Forester resigned, and the bureau was,\r\nfinally, in 1907, restricted to the colonization work, the forestry part\r\nbeing deliberately abandoned.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Province of Quebec pursued a more enlightened course. To\r\ncontrol the cut, a Culler’s office was established in 1842, which,\r\nhowever, only checked the square timber, then the principal material. In\r\n1873, after various futile attempts to secure better supervision, a\r\ncorps of forest rangers was created; but as they worked without\r\norganization the results were only partial until, in 1889, they were\r\nplaced under seven chiefs or superintendents. In 1897, the number of\r\nsuperintendents were reduced to one, but having to work with incompetent\r\nmen, political appointees, this improvement in headship did not produce\r\nmuch result. In 1907, a re-organization took place by introducing two\r\nprofessional foresters educated at government’s expense at American\r\ncolleges of forestry who upon their return were employed to supply the\r\ntechnical supervision of cutting on licensed lands, and otherwise to\r\nforward forestry reforms. In 1910, the logical sequence occurred by\r\nplacing the entire forest service except the protection against fire\r\nunder one of these technical men as chief, with the other one as his\r\nassistant, and a corps of three civil engineers, 40 forest rangers and\r\nsix scalers, besides 20 student assistants--the first organized\r\nprovincial forest service in Canada, administered under the\r\nSuperintendent of Woods and Forests in the Department of Crownlands.[17]\r\n\r\n  [17] See Report of Canadian Forestry Convention, 1911.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, the Dominion government had also recognized the need of more\r\ntechnical administration by instituting a Forestry Branch in the\r\nDepartment of the Interior under a superintendent with a view of\r\ndeveloping improved methods. At first manned without technical advisers,\r\nwho were, indeed, not in existence, gradually the professional element\r\nwas introduced, and the scope of the Branch enlarged, the irrigation\r\ninterests of the country being added. Under the able guidance of the\r\npresent director--whose task under the political conditions surrounding\r\nit is not an easy one--this department may in a few years also become\r\nfully organized with technical men, of whom there are now seventeen\r\nemployed, besides student assistants.\r\n\r\nThese various government agencies and other propaganda produced at\r\nleast the important result of committing the governments to see the\r\npropriety of setting aside permanent forest reserves.\r\n\r\nThe first movement in this direction was made in 1893, and in 1895, the\r\nfirst Dominion reservations were made by Executive Order through the\r\nMinister of the Interior. These, to be sure, were located in the thinly\r\ntimbered parts of the province of Manitoba, the Turtle Mountains and\r\nRiding Mountain, mainly for the protection of water supply.\r\n\r\nSeveral other similar reserves were set aside by the Minister, but to\r\ngive more stability to these reservations, an Act of Parliament was\r\npassed in 1906, declaring their permanence and placing them, 3,380,000\r\nacres, under the administration of the Superintendent of Forestry. There\r\nare so far, some 26 Dominion Forest Reserves created, or in the act of\r\ncreation, comprising an area of over 25,000 square miles. The Forestry\r\nBranch is making a brave beginning to survey and manage these reserves\r\nunder forestry principles.\r\n\r\nOf the provinces, Ontario was the first to recognize the principle of\r\nreservations in 1893, when a partially cut over, partially licensed\r\nterritory of over one million acres was set aside as the Algonquin\r\nNational Park in the Nipissing District, but the first definite\r\nestablishment of a forest reserve policy dates from the Forest Reserve\r\nAct, passed in 1898, which authorizes the Executive, as in the United\r\nStates, to withdraw lands for reserves. Some eight reserves and two\r\nparks have so far been established, and the reserved area amounts to\r\naround 20,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nOf management on forestry lines on these reserves there is so far little\r\nto be heard, except an effort to keep fires out.\r\n\r\nQuebec has followed this example of Ontario, first by setting aside the\r\nLaurentides Park in the Saguenay region, (1,634,000 acres), which, like\r\nAlgonquin Park, was more in the nature of a game preserve. During\r\n1906-7, however, under a law authorizing the Lieutenant Governor to set\r\naside forest reserves, over 100 million acres were placed in reserve.\r\nApparently, however, no administration of this preserve in the forestry\r\nsense is as yet attempted.\r\n\r\nBritish Columbia, which until lately was only concerned in disposing of\r\nthe well timbered crownlands, after having disposed of the best parts,\r\nhas placed under reservation the balance, and a forest commission of\r\ninquiry has been constituted to devise further measures in the interest\r\nof forestry. Its report, appearing in 1911, gives a very clear statement\r\nof conditions in the province and the promise of active organization of\r\na better service.\r\n\r\nOf other attempts to foster forestry interests may be mentioned a law in\r\nQuebec, passed in 1882, providing a bonus of $12 per acre for tree\r\nplanting, which seems to have remained without effect; another,\r\nproviding for a diameter limit of 12 inches on the stump for pine and 9\r\ninches for other kinds (these dimensions are now varied) inaugurated in\r\n1888, may have preserved some young growth on the limits, although,\r\nsince pulpwood is now the main product, and supervision has been\r\ninefficient, not much may be expected from such laws. Indeed, the chief\r\nof the forest service reports that 60% of the regeneration is of the\r\ninferior balsam fir.\r\n\r\nIn Ontario, a very competent Commission was created in 1897, with a\r\nnoted lumberman, Mr. Bertram as president, to formulate methods of\r\nreform; but the able report remained barren of results.\r\n\r\nThe Dominion has been active in encouraging tree-planting in the\r\nprairies. The Agricultural Experiment Station at Ottawa not only set out\r\nobject lessons by planting some 20 acres of sample plots, but for a\r\nnumber of years distributed plant material to settlers. This work was\r\nlater taken over by the Forestry Branch and increased to a larger scale,\r\nsome 85 acres being in nursery, and the distribution having grown to\r\n15,000,000 seedlings in 1910.\r\n\r\nOntario, under the direction of its Department of Agriculture and in\r\nco-operation with the Agricultural College at Guelph, has lately\r\nembarked in two movements of amelioration, namely, establishing a State\r\nnursery from which plant material at cost, with advice as to its use, is\r\ngiven to farmers, and purchasing and reforesting waste lands in the\r\nagricultural section.\r\n\r\nTariff legislation is another means which is in the hands of the\r\nDominion government to be used for encouraging forest conservancy. It\r\nhas, however, so far not been used directly for such purpose, fiscal and\r\ncommercial policies being uppermost. But the provinces have in this\r\nrespect helped themselves by encouraging manufacture rather than export\r\nof raw materials, Ontario leading in this matter by prohibiting export\r\nof unmanufactured logs from Crownlands in 1898. Other provinces impose\r\nan export duty on pulpwood cut on crownlands, as does also Ontario.\r\n\r\nAt present writing, a reciprocity agreement with the United States is\r\nunder contemplation, which would admit wood products from Canada free of\r\nduty--an arrangement which whatever its commercial advantages bodes no\r\ngood for a conservative forest policy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile private limit holders, here and there, had begun to see the\r\nneed of conservative methods, and by 1908, at least two large Paper and\r\nPulp concerns had placed foresters in charge of their logging\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Education._\r\n\r\nUntil 1900, associated effort to advance forestry in Canada had relied\r\non the international American Forestry Association. In that year,\r\nlargely through the officials of the Dominion Forestry Branch (Mr. E.\r\nStewart), the Canadian Forestry Association was formed.\r\n\r\nThis Association has grown more and more vigorous, and having escaped\r\nthe period of sentimentalism which in the United States retarded the\r\nmovement so long, could at once accentuate the economic point of view\r\nand bring the lumbermen into sympathy with their effort. In 1905, a\r\nquarterly magazine, the Canadian Forestry Journal was started by the\r\nAssociation, making its work of instruction and propaganda more\r\neffective. The technical literature, as yet slightly developed is found\r\nmainly in Bulletins of the Forestry Branch.\r\n\r\nA most promising convention held in January 1906, with the Premier of\r\nthe Dominion presiding, participated by prominent officials and business\r\nmen, seemed to foreshadow the time when a real rational forest\r\nmanagement, at least in some parts of the Dominion would be inaugurated.\r\n\r\nBut it can hardly be said that the expectations were realized, and\r\nanother such convention was held in 1911, which may perhaps be followed\r\nby better results.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, following the precedent of the United States, a Conservation\r\nCommission was appointed for the Dominion under federal support, manned\r\nby the leading officials and prominent representative men from all\r\nprovinces, and here the forestry interests may find at least educational\r\nadvancement. The first two years of the existence of this Commission\r\nhave, however, produced little advancement.\r\n\r\nWhile the Ontario government had directly discredited the forestry\r\nmovement by abolishing its bureau of forestry, indirectly it laid the\r\nfoundation for a sure future, in 1907, by establishing in its provincial\r\nUniversity at Toronto a Faculty of Forestry, with full equipment. A year\r\nlater, the Province of New Brunswick also established a chair of\r\nforestry in its University, while some time earlier, the Guelph\r\nAgricultural College had introduced the subject of farm forestry in its\r\ncurricula. The latest development in educational direction is the forest\r\nschool organized in 1910 by the government of Quebec in connection with\r\nits forest service for the purpose of educating its own agents.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWFOUNDLAND.\r\n\r\nNewfoundland, probably the first discovery of America by the Norsemen,\r\nremained a mere fishing station until modern times, and, except for the\r\nopen coast, unknown as regards the wooded interior, which was supposed\r\nto be largely barren. It became a possession of Great Britain in 1713.\r\nDevelopment did not begin until 1880 when the first railroad was built,\r\nand has progressed more rapidly since the Newfoundland Railway\r\ntraversing the entire island was opened in 1898. It was found that,\r\nwhile the shores and a considerable part of the West and South coast are\r\nbarren or poorly timbered, and on the interior plateau large moss\r\nbarrens exist, there are extensive timber areas of mixed growth, White\r\nand Red Pine, Balsam and Spruce, with White Birch. A lumber industry,\r\nwhich by 1904 had grown up to probably not less than 100 million feet,\r\nis rapidly extending over the whole island, and an extensive paper pulp\r\nindustry is preparing to establish itself, on timber limits under a\r\nlicense system similar to that applied in other parts of Canada. Some\r\n5000 square miles are now under license. Forest fires have repeatedly\r\ndevastated large areas, especially in 1904. The experience of that year\r\nled to the enactment of a forest fire law, but without any agency to\r\nmake it effective.\r\n\r\nNo forest policy exists, except the commercial restriction of the\r\nlicense system. A forestry association has lately been formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER BRITISH POSSESSIONS AND COLONIES.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the Indian forest service, or stimulated by its\r\nsuccess, some of the other British Colonial governments in Africa and\r\nAustralia have attempted and sometimes succeeded in establishing a\r\nforest policy.\r\n\r\nOf East Indian territories, _Ceylon_, the nearest neighbor to India,\r\nwith over 25,000 square miles, of which 42 per cent. wooded, mostly with\r\nsecond growth forest of small value, attempted long ago an organization\r\nwith the aid of Indian foresters, but by 1900 had of over 10,000 square\r\nmiles only 431 in reserves, in addition to nearly 1800 acres planted.\r\nOne Conservator and 8 Assistant Conservators produce a net revenue of\r\nless than $30,000, there being an import of $250,000 necessary to eke\r\nout the wood requirements of the 3.5 million people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Straits Settlement_, an area of 1526 square miles, had, by 1900, a\r\nreserved state forest area of 138 square miles under an experienced\r\nIndian forest officer. Gutta percha, rubber and gums are here the most\r\nvaluable products.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Federated Malay States_, with 26,350 square miles, and heavily\r\nwooded, after a report by the Indian Inspector-General, have begun to\r\nreserve forest areas, some 100,000 acres having been set aside, which\r\nare administered by the Conservator of the Strait Settlement’s reserves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe government of the island of _Cyprus_ also employs a forest officer\r\nand guards to look after its 700 square miles of forest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn _Africa_, during the last few years small forest departments have\r\nbeen established by the governments of the Soudan, East Africa, Nigeria,\r\nTransvaal, Orange River and Natal, mostly for the purpose of planting on\r\nthe treeless plains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe government of _Mauritius_ had made attempts at conservancy for many\r\nyears, but without notable success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most successful attempt in Africa so far is reported from _Cape\r\nColony_, which as early as 1819 had a Superintendent of Lands and Woods,\r\nand in 1876, a Department of Forests and Plantations, neither of which\r\nhave left much of record.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, a new forest department under a French forest officer was\r\nstarted, which has grown until now its consists of one Conservator (D.\r\nE. Hutchins), 22 Assistant Conservators, 84 European foresters, and a\r\nfew native guards. In 1888, the needed legislation was had for\r\nregulating the working of the nearly half million acres of forest area,\r\nwhich, in 1902, was declared inalienable government property. Since the\r\nwood imports amount to over two million and a quarter dollars annually,\r\nthe need of conservative use is appreciated especially as climatic\r\nconditions are unfavorable to reproduction. Some 24,000 acres have been\r\nplanted during 22 years, at a cost of $1,500,000, the first plantations\r\nbeginning to yield a substantial revenue, and it is believed that\r\nanother 40,000 acres of such plantations would supply all the timber\r\nneeded in the Colony. Treeplanting by private land owners and\r\nmunicipalities is encouraged by furnishing advice gratis and plant\r\nmaterial at low cost, and to municipalities in addition government aid\r\nis extended to the extent of half the cost of planting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe seven _Australian_ colonies are very variously situated regarding\r\ntimber supplies, three of them, Queensland, Western and South Australia\r\nbeing poorly wooded, the others more or less heavily forested,\r\nespecially Tasmania with 65 per cent., and New Zealand with 31 per cent.\r\nGenerally speaking the forest areas are confined to the coast in\r\nnarrower and wider belts, the interior being forestless or with scrubby\r\ngrowth. This portion is large enough to reduce the total forest per\r\ncent. to less than 6.5. The mountains and hill ranges facing the\r\nEastern, Southern and Western coasts are especially heavily wooded with\r\nmagnificent Eucalypts, Jarrah and Karri while the Kauri pine is the most\r\nvaluable tree in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe one successful attempt at a forest policy was made by the almost\r\nforestless colony of _South Australia_, which in 1882 reserved its\r\nscanty forest area of 217,000 acres and started to plant, (now 13,000\r\nacres planted), employing a Conservator and six Foresters.\r\n\r\nIn the other colonies at various times unsuccessful beginnings were\r\nmade, and there exist in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria\r\nso-called Forest Branches or departments, but mostly without power or\r\nequipment, and no intelligent conception of forest policy seems\r\npractically to exist.\r\n\r\nIn _Queensland_, since 1897, the Governor in Council may reserve forest\r\nlands and regulate the cutting by diameter limit. One and a half million\r\nacres have been reserved, but no staff for administration exists.\r\n\r\nIn _New South Wales_ six million acres were withdrawn from settlement,\r\nbut it is mostly used for pasture, and withdrawal may be revoked at any\r\ntime. No effective system of control exists.\r\n\r\nIn _Victoria_ five and a half million acres have been declared reserves\r\nunder act of 1890, nearly half the forest area. There exists a forest\r\ndepartment of one Conservator, two Inspectors and 25 Foresters, but no\r\nplan of management. Four State nurseries of doubtful value seems the\r\nwhole result.\r\n\r\nThe other colonies still merely exploit their forest resources under\r\nloosely managed license systems, without even an inefficient attempt at\r\nintelligent treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Forestry of Japan_, 1904, published by the Imperial Bureau of\r\n  Forestry in connection with the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, and a\r\n  reprint with additions in 1910, contains most of the information\r\n  utilized above.\r\n\r\n  _Aus den Waldungen Japans_, by Dr. Heinrich Mayr, 1891, gives a full\r\n  account of the forest geography, which is also to be found in J. J.\r\n  Rein, _Japan_, 1886.\r\n\r\n  _Der Wald in Japan_, an article by Dr. Hefele in\r\n  Forstwissenschaftliches Centralblatt, 1903, gives an insight into\r\n  forest conditions from the point of view of a forester.\r\n\r\n  A very clear analysis of the development of property rights is to be\r\n  found in an article by Dr. Zentaro Kawase in Allgemeine Forst- und\r\n  Jagdzeitung, 1894.\r\n\r\n  An article in Zeitschrift für Forst- und Jagdwesen from the pen of\r\n  Prof. H. Matsuno, the first professional forester of Japan, gives a\r\n  brief account of the development of forestry, especially in earlier\r\n  times.\r\n\r\n  A report by Special Canadian Trade Commissioner W. T. R. Preston,\r\n  1908, contains valuable statistics on the lumber trade.\r\n\r\nThe modernization of this remarkable island empire of Niphon (the native\r\nname), which began in 1868, included the organization of a forest\r\ndepartment after German models. Curiously enough, there are other\r\nnoteworthy points of similarity to be found in the historic development\r\nof forestry in Germany and Japan.\r\n\r\nThe empire comprises four larger islands--Kiushiu, Shikoku, Hondo or\r\nHonshiu, and Hokkaido or Yesso--and a host of smaller ones, stretching\r\nin a chain of nearly 3,000 miles north and south along the Asiatic\r\nshore, the width of land being nowhere over 200 miles. It comprises an\r\narea of nearly 150,000 square miles, with a population approximating 50\r\nmillion, largely engaged in fisheries and other sea industries.\r\n\r\nThe islands are of volcanic origin--part of the “girdle of fire” which\r\nreaches from the Alaska peninsula through the Philippines to the\r\nAntilles--with many active craters, subject to frequent disastrous\r\nearthquakes and tidal waves; mountainous, with numerous ranges of high\r\nhills and with lofty central ridges, with numerous short rivers, apt to\r\nturn into treacherous torrents, while hurricanes and waterspouts,\r\ntyphoons and equinoctial gales sweep the surrounding seas frequently.\r\n\r\nThe soil is nowhere particularly fertile, but the patient and\r\npainstaking labor of the Japanese has brought every available foot of\r\nit--little more than 10% is arable--into producing condition, wherever\r\nthe climate compensates for the infertility, especially in the most\r\ndensely populated part, the southern half of Hondo.\r\n\r\nExtending through 30 degrees of latitude, the climate naturally varies\r\nfrom the tropical one of Formosa, through all variations of the\r\ntemperate, to the alpine one of the high mountains and the nearly arctic\r\none of the Kurile islands. The Japan current skirting the eastern coast,\r\nand the mountain ranges, with elevations generally not exceeding 6,000\r\nfeet, occasionally up to over 13,000 feet, which cut off the dry\r\ncontinental west winds, also produce great climatic variations between\r\neast and west coasts. In general, however, the climate of the whole\r\nempire is characterized by a high percentage of relative humidity and\r\nample rainfall, especially during the hot season, producing luxuriant\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Forest Conditions, and Ownership._\r\n\r\nDue to these great variations in climate, four climatic regions being\r\ndifferentiated, the forest flora of Japan almost rivals in variety that\r\nof the United States, with over 200 deciduous, and more than 30\r\nconiferous species of size (besides a large number of half-trees),\r\nalthough not more than some 50 or 60 are of silvicultural importance,\r\nand not more than 10 or 12 species form the basis of forest management\r\nand of the lumber trade, which requires some two billion cubic feet\r\nannually, and supports an export of over six million dollars. The value\r\nof the total cut was, in 1907, placed at over 17 million dollars, of\r\nwhich six million was to the credit of the State Treasury.\r\n\r\nIn the tropical districts, bamboos form the main staple; in the\r\nsubtropical region, the most densely populated and hence also almost\r\nforestless, the broadleaf evergreens, especially several species of oak,\r\nfurnish desirable fuel wood, and two species of pine are most valued for\r\ntimber, one, the Red Pine (_P. densiflora_) extending its realm rapidly\r\nover waste areas; camphor tree and boxwood furnish ornamental wood.\r\n\r\nThe region of temperate forest furnishes, out of over 60 species, some\r\n14 conifers and 19 broadleaf trees of value, the former mainly of the\r\ncedar tribe, with _Chamaecyparis obtusa_ and _Cryptomeria japonica_ the\r\nmost widely used, while of the broadleaf species, which occupy more than\r\n50 per cent. of the forest area, _Zelkowa keaki_, of the elm tribe, a\r\nchestnut, a beech, several oaks, a walnut, and an ash count among the\r\nmost useful.\r\n\r\nSpruce, Fir, and White Birch are the trees of the northern forest.\r\n\r\nMixed forest forms 45%, broadleaf 25%, conifer 21%, and 9% is rated as\r\nblank or thinly stocked.\r\n\r\nThe forest area, which, over the whole, covers, with the addition of the\r\nnewly acquired island of Saghalien, 67% of the land area, or around 75\r\nmillion acres (1¼ acres per capita), is quite unevenly distributed\r\naccording to topography and population, being mostly confined to the\r\nmountain ranges and hills which form the backbone of the country, and to\r\nthe northern provinces, which contain still large, untouched areas.\r\nHokkaido, which was opened up to colonization only 35 years ago, now\r\nwith a population of only 20 to the square mile, has 63% of forest, 15\r\nacres per capita; the northern part of Hondo has a somewhat greater area\r\nper cent., mostly on the high steep mountains, but only 1.2 acres per\r\ncapita; on the southern portion, the low ranges of hills and valleys the\r\nforest area has been reduced to 53%, but shows only three-quarter acre\r\nper capita; and Okinawa, with 26%, and less than one-third acre per\r\ncapita, shows the lowest.\r\n\r\nOf this forest area, however, almost one-half is “hara,” brush forest,\r\nchaparral, or dwarfed tree growth--the result of mismanagement,\r\nexcessive cutting and fires--and in the southern districts, impenetrable\r\nthickets of dwarf bamboo, which crowd out tree and even shrub growth\r\nwherever such mismanagement gives it entrance. These extensive haras are\r\ncut every two or five years for the brush, which is used to cover and\r\nfurnish manure for rice fields.\r\n\r\nFire, which, until lately, ran over 5 or 6 million acres annually, and\r\nruthless cutting, have in the past and are still deteriorating the\r\nforest area.\r\n\r\nGrassy prairie and barrens due to natural conditions are not absent, and\r\nare due to excessive drainage through loose coarse-grained rock soil;\r\nthey are found, not extensively, at the foot of volcanoes, and on\r\nhighest elevations. The differentiation of land areas is not quite\r\ncertain. In 1894, there was still 30.5% of grassy prairie reported, but\r\nsome of this, no doubt, was forested, probably one-half.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the forest area is owned by the State and the Imperial\r\nHousehold. Communal forests are estimated to aggregate, in 1904,\r\nsomewhat over four million acres (7.5%), in 1910 reported as 11%, and\r\nprivate property some 18 million (26%; in 1910, 22%) leaving 30 million\r\nfor the State and for Imperial or Crown forest (66%), the latter\r\ncomprising some 5.5 million acres.\r\n\r\nThese figures are liable to variation, due to sales of the latter class,\r\nand to adjustments of the somewhat obscure property rights.\r\n\r\nThe ownership by the State and a conservative use of the mountain forest\r\nis necessitated by the protective value of the forest cover, the\r\ncultivation of the extensive rice fields being dependent upon\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Development of Forest Policy._\r\n\r\nThe history of Japan dates back to 660 B.C., when the empire was founded\r\non the island of Kiushiu by the warrior king Jimmuteno. He established a\r\nkind of feudal government, with the daimios (knights or barons) holding\r\ntheir fiefs from the mikado, who was considered the sole owner of the\r\nsoil, or at least all exercise of ownership rights emanated from him.\r\nPrivate property seems then not to have existed at all, the people\r\nhaving merely rights of user. Colonization of the islands brought under\r\nthe mikado’s dominion progressed rapidly, and with it, not only arable\r\nportions but even mountains were denuded.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the Christian era, the need of better protection\r\nagainst floods seems to have been recognized, and, in 270 A.D., we find\r\nthe first forest official appointed, a son of the royal house, who with\r\nassistants was to regulate the use of the forest property, which, under\r\nthe rights of user granted by the mikado, was being excessively\r\nexploited and devastated.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth century, the feudal method of giving fiefs of land and\r\nforest to the deserving vassals had come generally into vogue, and\r\nlater, with the rise of Buddhism, forests were assigned to the temples\r\nand priests, who, as in Germany the monks, were assiduous in cultivating\r\nand utilizing them.\r\n\r\nSoon the daimios, similarly to the barons in Germany, began to assert\r\nexclusive property rights, and, notwithstanding various edicts, issued\r\nfrom time to time to secure free use to the people, more and more of the\r\nforest area was secured by daimios, and by priests as temple forests.\r\n\r\nIn the ninth century, deforestation and excessive exploitation had so\r\nfar progressed that not only the need of protecting watersheds was\r\nrecognized by edicts, but fear of a timber famine led even to planting\r\nin the provinces of Noto.\r\n\r\nA period of internal strife and warfare during the following centuries\r\nwhich left forest interest in the background, led, in 1192, to the\r\nestablishment of the rule of the shoguns, the hereditary military\r\nrepresentatives of the mikado, who made him a mere figurehead, and\r\nexercised all the imperial functions themselves, until the revolution of\r\n1868 restored the mikado to his rights.\r\n\r\nThe effort at conservative forest use was renewed with increased\r\nharshness when, after a period of warfare and devastation, the great\r\nshogun family of Tokugawa (1603) assumed the rule of the empire,\r\nenforcing the restrictive edicts with military severity. Even at that\r\nearly age, the protective influence of forest cover on soil and\r\nwaterflow was fully recognized, and a distinction of open or supply\r\nforest and closed or protection forests seems to have been made, the\r\nlatter being placed under the ban of the emperor or shogun, and\r\nwithdrawn from utilization. The extensive forests of the province of\r\nKiso, the best remaining, owe their preservation to these efforts. The\r\ndaimios, 260 in number, each in his district, enforced the edicts in\r\ntheir own way, giving rise thereby to great differences in forest\r\nadministration; yet in the absence of technical knowledge, deterioration\r\ncontinued. The severity of punishments for depredations etc., reminds us\r\nof those of the German Markgenossen, a hand or finger being the penalty\r\nfor theft, death by fire that for incendiaries.\r\n\r\nThe idea of protecting or reserving certain species of trees, which was\r\npracticed in India by the rajahs, we find here again in the beginning of\r\nthe 18th century, the number of such protected species varying from one\r\nto seven and even fifteen in different districts. Another unique and\r\npeculiar way of encouraging forest culture was to permit peasants who\r\nmade forest plantations in the State forests, to bear a family name, a\r\nright which was otherwise reserved to the knights or samurli, or to wear\r\na double-edged sword like the latter. Arbor days were also instituted,\r\nmemorial days and festivities, as at the birth of children, being marked\r\nby the planting of trees.\r\n\r\nWhile in Germany the love of hunting had led to the exclusion of the\r\npeople from the forests, in Japan it was a question of conserving wood\r\nsupplies that dictated these policies.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that to these early efforts is due the preservation of the\r\nremaining forests. But, while this may be true in some instances, as in\r\nthe province of Kiso, more probably their distance from centers of\r\nconsumption and their general inaccessibility preserved those of\r\nHokkaido and of the northern mountains. Certainly the brush forests\r\nsouth of Tokyo do not testify to great care.\r\n\r\nThe detested shogunate was abolished in 1867 by a revolution which\r\nbrought the mikado to his rights again and crushed the power of the\r\ndaimios, whose fiefs were surrendered, and their acquisitions of forest\r\nproperty, as well as (a few years later) those of the priests, were\r\ndeclared State property, with the exception of some which were\r\nrecognized as communal properties.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the experiences of France, the disturbances in property\r\nconditions, which implied instantaneous loss by the people of all rights\r\nof user in the State property as well as removal of all restrictions\r\nfrom private and communal properties, led to wholesale depredations from\r\nthe State domain, and to widespread deforestation and devastation, an\r\narea of a million acres of burnt waste near Kofu, west of Tokyo,\r\ntestifying to the recklessness of these times.\r\n\r\nWithout any force to guard property rights, stealing on an extensive\r\nscale, similar to past experiences in the United States, with the\r\naccompanying wastefulness, became the order of the day, and is even now\r\nnot uncommon.\r\n\r\nA first provisional administration of State forests was inaugurated, and\r\na forest reconnaissance ordered in 1875 in order to secure insight into\r\nthe mixed-up property relations, and restore to their rightful owners\r\nsuch portions as had been wrongly taken by the State.\r\n\r\nIn 1878, the State forests were placed under a special bureau organized\r\nby Matsuno, who had studied forestry in Germany (Eberswalde) for five\r\nyears. But it was not academic knowledge that was needed in the\r\nsituation; it was necessary first to mould public opinion in order to\r\nsecure means for administrative measures.\r\n\r\nThis he set himself to do through public addresses and pamphlets, and by\r\norganizing a society of friends of forest culture, and finally, in 1882,\r\nby establishing an experiment station at Nishigahara, and, a year later,\r\na dendrological school, which four years later was combined with the\r\nagricultural school at Komaba; five years later both were joined to the\r\nUniversity of Tokyo.\r\n\r\nWith the transfer of the forestry bureau to the Department of\r\nAgriculture and Commerce in 1881, and a reorganization in 1886, a new\r\nera seemed to be promised, yet a substantial progress in organized\r\nforest management of the State property does not seem to have been made\r\nfor another decade at least, the slow progress being largely due to lack\r\nof personnel and the continuance of mixed property conditions, which\r\ninvolved not only uncertainty of boundaries, but also mixed ownerships.\r\n\r\nAlthough this last trouble, namely of mixed ownership by State and\r\nprivate individuals, had been recognized as inimical to good management,\r\nit was deliberately increased by the law of 1878 in a curious way,\r\nreviving an old custom, namely by permitting private individuals to\r\nplant up clearings in the State forests; in this way, these individuals\r\nsecured a certain percentage, usually 20 per cent., of the eventual\r\nprofits arising from the results. Some 200,000 acres were planted under\r\nthis arrangement.\r\n\r\nTo remove the boundary difficulty, a survey of the boundaries of State\r\nproperty and adjustment of property rights, as well as segregation of\r\nthe State lands to be disposed of, namely small lots and others not\r\nneeded, was ordered in 1890.\r\n\r\nIt was then also that the first provisional working plan for the\r\nfellings on State lands was elaborated, and gradually with the progress\r\nof the survey, more permanent plans were adopted for district after\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nBy 1899, the adjustment had progressed far enough to begin the\r\nrestoration of properties, which the State had improperly claimed, to\r\ntheir proper owners. It was then also that the Imperial forests,\r\nintended for the support of the Imperial household, were increased to\r\nabout 5 million acres.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the personnel had increased in numbers and improved in\r\ncharacter. In 1904, the organization of the forestry bureau under the\r\nMinister of Agriculture and Commerce, arranged somewhat after German\r\nmodels, consisted of one director and four forest commissioners with ten\r\nclerks, forming the head office; the sixteen districts into which the\r\nState forests were divided were presided over by 32 conservators and 80\r\ninspectors, while 325 district officers with 880 assistants and 626\r\nguards, altogether over 1,800 employes, formed the field force. In 1910,\r\nthe number had increased to 2500, mainly by additional rangers. This\r\norganization applies to the State forests under control of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. Strangely enough, those in Saghalien,\r\nHokkaido and Formosa are not under that department, but under the\r\nsupervision of the Minister of Home Affairs, and are merely exploited,\r\nwhile the Imperial forests are under the Household Department. In 1907,\r\nonly 7 per cent. of the State forests were under working plans.\r\n\r\nThe need of supervision of the ill-managed private and communal forests,\r\nmostly located near the settled portions, early attracted the attention\r\nof the new regime, mainly on account of their protective value. Annual\r\nlosses through floods to the amount of four million dollars, and\r\nsimilar losses due to unchecked forest fires gave the incentive to the\r\npassage of a law, in 1882, simply forbidding all forest use in\r\nprotection forest, which simple prescription evidently did not work\r\nuntil a further revision was made in 1897. This latter does not confine\r\nitself to legislation for protection forests alone, but also authorizes\r\nthe supervision of supply forests, under the special control of the\r\nlocal governors. Under this law, which also extended the assistance of\r\nlocal authorities to would-be planters, aided by reforms in the\r\ncorporation system, remarkable activity in planting waste lands ensued,\r\nso that in the next two years not less than one million acres of\r\ncommunal property was set out with trees, numbering over 800 million,\r\nwhile in the State forests, some 400,000 acres of vacant land had been\r\nplanted by 1970. Some sand dune planting and reboisement works are also\r\nthe result of this legislation. Further legislation more closely\r\ndefining State control was had in 1907.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this planting, it may be of interest to record the\r\nattitude of Japanese foresters toward natural regeneration: “This is no\r\nlonger popular in these days when the knowledge of forest management\r\npossessed by foresters has become highly developed, for if that method\r\nis the easiest and least troublesome, nevertheless it is not advisable,\r\nin view of the necessity of effecting a thorough improvement in our\r\nsilvicultural conditions. Only on steep slopes and for protection\r\nforests is it applicable.”\r\n\r\nIn 1897, also, some eight experiment stations were organized, in\r\naddition to the earlier one at Nishigahara organized, in 1882, by\r\nMatsuno.\r\n\r\nEducation in forestry has lately run riot in Japan as it has in the\r\nUnited States. Since the first school, organized in 1882, not less than\r\n62 institutions had seen the need of offering the opportunity to become\r\nacquainted with that subject. By 1910, these had been reduced to 47.\r\nHere, however, different grades are frankly acknowledged. There are\r\nthree collegiate institutions whose diploma admits to the higher\r\nservice, four are of secondary grade, nineteen give special courses, and\r\nthe rest treat the subject merely as a subsidiary of a practical\r\neducation including agriculture, stock-farming and fishery. A ranger\r\nschool, which was instituted under Matsuno’s guidance, controlled by the\r\nforestry bureau, came to an end during the Russian war for lack of\r\nfunds, but has probably been revived again.\r\n\r\nA forestry association now with 4000 members carries on propaganda and\r\npublishes a magazine, and co-operative associations among small owners\r\nto facilitate better management are being formed under the law of 1907.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we may say that Japan has done wonders in reorganizing\r\nits forestry system in a short time, but, according to one competent\r\nobserver, while all the Japanese care for detail and love for\r\norderliness is apparent in the office, not all that is found on paper is\r\nto be found as yet in the woods, and that, for similar reasons as have\r\nbeen indicated for Russia; many things happen in the woods that are not\r\nknown in the office.\r\n\r\n\r\nKOREA.\r\n\r\nThe latest move in forest reform in this part of the world, as a result\r\nof Japanese influence, is to be recorded from Korea. Indeed, in 1910,\r\nJapan annexed Korea, and will doubtless apply her own methods in the new\r\nprovince. The forest area of Korea comprises only about 2,500,000 acres,\r\nout of an area of nearly 53 million acres of very mountainous country. A\r\nconcession for the exploitation of the northern forests to a Russian,\r\nwhich included the re-planting with “exotic” tree species, was the\r\nimmediate cause of the Russo-Japanese war. In 1907, by co-operative\r\narrangements with Japan, a conservative forest policy was to be\r\ninaugurated by laws similar to those of Japan.\r\n\r\nDrouth, floods and erosion of soils have been common experiences. The\r\npreservation of forest cover, especially at the headquarters of the Yalu\r\nand Tumen in the northern part of the country, is aimed at.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose the government has taken all forests under its care.\r\nAll private owners or lease holders must report their holdings and have\r\ntheir property listed, and in case of failure to do so the property is\r\nforfeited. The government may then expropriate, or else regulate the\r\ncutting, or, where protective functions of the forest cover require it,\r\nmay forbid cutting altogether.\r\n\r\nA forestry school is also part of the program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Report upon Forestry_, 1878-9, by Dr. F. B. Hough; contains\r\n  references to the earlier history of forest development.\r\n\r\n  _History of the Lumber Industry_, by J. E.

Fernow. House Document No. 181,\r\n  55th Congress; contains amplifications of the matter contained in\r\n  this chapter.\r\n\r\n  Annual and other reports issued by the Department of Agriculture, by\r\n  the various State Forest Commissions, and Forestry Associations.\r\n\r\n  For latest developments, consult _Conservation (American Forestry)_\r\n  and _Forestry Quarterly_.\r\n\r\nThe great and exuberant republic of the United States, vast in extent\r\nand rich in natural resources generally, excelled and still excels in\r\nextent, importance and value of her timber resources; and, having only\r\nlately begun to inaugurate rational forest policies, promises to become\r\nof all-absorbing interest to foresters.\r\n\r\nThe marvelous growth of the nation, which from three million in 1780 had\r\nattained to a population of 76 million in 1900, and, by the last Census\r\nnumbered around 92 million people, has been the wonder of the world by\r\nreason of its rapid expansion; and yet the limit is far from being\r\nreached. Annually some three-quarters of a million or more immigrants\r\nfrom all parts of the world arrive, and there is still room and\r\ncomfortable living for at least another 100 million, if the resources\r\nare properly treated.\r\n\r\nThe large land area of nearly two billion acres (over three million\r\nsquare miles) is undoubtedly the richest contiguous domain of such size\r\nin the world, located most favorably with reference to trade by virtue\r\nof a coast line of over 20,000 miles, and diversified in climate so as\r\nto permit the widest range of production.\r\n\r\nWhile a simple mathematical relation would make the population at\r\npresent about 31 to the square mile, such a statement would give an\r\nerroneous conception of economic conditions, for the distribution of the\r\npopulation is most uneven, a condition which must eventually diversify\r\nthe application of forestry methods in different parts of the country.\r\nIn Massachusetts and Rhode Island combined, for instance, the density of\r\npopulation is 428 to the square mile, exceeding that of the\r\nsimilar-sized State of Würtemberg in Germany, while in the neighboring\r\nState of Maine it is not 25; the Atlantic Coast States south of South\r\nCarolina, a territory slightly larger than Germany, show about half, and\r\nthe Central agricultural States about one-third the density of that\r\ndensely populated country; on the other hand, some of the Western\r\nStates, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico have less than\r\nthree to the square mile.\r\n\r\nSimilar unevenness is found in the distribution of resources, especially\r\nof timber wealth, and, to some extent at least, the present populational\r\ndistribution is explained by the uneven distribution of farm soils and\r\ntimber.\r\n\r\nOutside of the unorganized territory of Alaska and the disfranchised\r\nDistrict of Columbia, the country is divided into 46 States and two\r\nTerritories which will eventually acquire statehood. In addition, there\r\nare a number of insular possessions under the direct control of the\r\nfederal government. Each State being under the Constitution sovereign in\r\nitself as far as its internal administration is concerned, it is evident\r\nthat no uniformity of policies can be expected, except so far as\r\nimitativeness, in which the American citizen excels, may lead State\r\nafter State to repeat the experiment attempted by one. The federal\r\ngovernment has no direct jurisdiction in matters concerning the\r\nmanagement of resources within the States, except so far as it still\r\nowns lands in the Western, so-called Public Land States, and a few\r\nparcels in the Eastern States over which it still retains jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe severest test of democratic institutions is experienced when the\r\nattempt is made to establish a policy which shall guard the interests of\r\nthe future at the expense of the demands and needs of the present.\r\nDemocracy produces attitudes and characteristics of the people which are\r\ninimical to stable economic arrangements looking to the future, such as\r\nare implied in a forest policy. The vast country with an unevenly\r\ndistributed and heterogeneous population presents the greatest variety\r\nof natural, as well as of economic conditions; the immediate interests\r\nof one section naturally do not coincide with those of other sections;\r\nparticularistic and individualistic tendencies of the true democrat are\r\nantagonistic to anything which smacks of “paternalism,” the attitude\r\nunder which alone a persistent, farsighted policy can thrive. Frequent\r\nchange of administration, or at least the threat of such change, impedes\r\nconsistent execution of plans; fickle public opinion may subvert at any\r\ntime well laid plans which take time in maturing; the true democratic\r\ndoctrine of restricting State activity to police functions, and the\r\ndoctrine of non-interference with private rights, as well as the idea of\r\nState rights in opposition to federal power and authority--all these\r\ncharacteristics of a democratic government are impediments to a\r\nconcerted action and stable policy.\r\n\r\nThat, in spite of these antagonistic interests, conditions and\r\ndoctrines, substantial progress toward establishing at least a federal\r\nforest policy has been made, is due to the fact that the American, in\r\nspite of his reputation as a materialistic, selfish opportunist, is\r\nreally an idealist; that he responds readily to patriotic appeals; that,\r\nin spite of his rabid nationalism, he is willing to learn from the\r\nexperiences of other nations; that, indeed, he is anxious to be\r\neducated. Finally, much credit is due to the men who with single purpose\r\ndevoted their lives to the education of their fellow citizens in this\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIt must, to be sure, be added that remarkable changes in the political\r\nattitude of the people have taken place in the last 30 years since the\r\npropaganda of forestry began; changes, partly perhaps induced by that\r\npropaganda, which have aided this movement, and which, if they persist,\r\npromise much for the future development of forest policies. A decidedly\r\npaternalistic, if not socialistic attitude has, lately been taken by the\r\nfederal government; and by skilful construction of the Constitution as\r\nregards the right to regulate interstate relations, has led to an\r\nexpansion of federal power in various directions. A similar\r\npaternalistic attitude has developed in the legislatures of several\r\nStates to a noticeable degree. Even the judiciary has taken up this new\r\nspirit, and is ready to sanction interference with private property\r\nrights to a degree which, a decade ago, would have been denounced as\r\nundemocratic and tyrannical. Two courts have lately ruled that owners of\r\ntimberlands may be restricted, without compensation, as regards the size\r\nof trees they may fell on their property, if the welfare of the State\r\ndemands such interference.\r\n\r\nThe argument of the Roman doctrine _utere tuo ne alterum noceas_, which\r\nforestry propagandists have so strenuously used, seems finally to have\r\nfound favor, and the inclusion of the community at large, present and\r\nfuture, as the possibly damaged party does not appear any more strained.\r\nThe idea of the _providential function_ of governments, as the writer\r\nhas called it, seems to have taken hold of the people. The democratic\r\ndoctrine of State rights, and restriction of government functions has,\r\neven among Democrats, been weakened through the long continued reign of\r\nthe Republican party, the party of centralizing tendencies, to such an\r\nextent that the latest Democratic platform of a Presidential campaign\r\n(1908) outdid the Republican platform in centralizing and paternalistic\r\npropositions.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to emphasize the growth of this socialistic attitude, as it\r\nis bound to influence, and influence favorably, the further development\r\nof forest policies.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is still necessary to keep in mind that the States are\r\nautonomous, and that, while the federal government, in spite of the\r\nantagonism in the Western States, in which the public lands are\r\nsituated, has been able to change its land policy from that of liberal\r\ndisposal to one of reservation, it alone cannot save the situation.\r\nWhile a few of the States have made beginnings in working out a policy\r\nto arrest the destruction of their forest resources, which are mostly in\r\nprivate hands, still much water must flow down the Mississippi before\r\nadequate measures will be taken to stave off the threatening timber\r\nfamine, and the energy of the various local and national Conservation\r\nassociations will need to be exercised to the utmost.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Forest Conditions._\r\n\r\nThree extensive mountain systems, running north and south, give rise to\r\nat least eight topographic subdivisions of the country, going from east\r\nto west.\r\n\r\n1. The narrow belt of level coast and hill country along the Atlantic\r\nshore, from 100 to 200 miles in width with elevations up to 1,000 feet,\r\nbut especially low along the seacoast from Virginia south; drained by\r\nshort rivers navigable only for short distances from the mouth; a\r\nfarming country, with the soils varying from the richest to the poorest;\r\nsome 300,000 square miles.\r\n\r\n2. The Appalachian mountain country, nearly of the same width as the\r\nfirst section, with elevations up to 5,000 feet; the watershed of all\r\nthe rivers to the Atlantic, of several rivers to the Gulf, and of the\r\neastern affluents of the Mississippi; a mountain country, of about\r\n360,000 square miles extent, rich in coal, iron and other minerals,\r\nexcept in its northern extension formed of archean rock.\r\n\r\n3. The great river basin of the Mississippi, a Central plain of glacial\r\nand river deposit, rising gradually from the Gulf to the headwaters for\r\nmore than 1200 miles, and nowhere over 1,000 feet above sea level; the\r\nrichest agricultural section, 700,000 square miles, more or less, in\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n4. The plateau, rising towards the Rocky Mountains from 1,000 to 5,000\r\nfeet above sea level, some 870,000 square miles in extent, a region of\r\nscanty rainfall, hence of prairie and plain, but mostly rich soil of\r\nundetermined depth, capable of prolific production where sufficient\r\nwater supply is available.\r\n\r\n5. The Rocky Mountain region, rising from 5,000 to near 10,000 feet\r\n(except some higher peaks), an arid to semi-arid district of rugged\r\nranges, covered mostly with forest growth, often open and of inferior\r\nkind, with tillable soils in the narrow valleys, requiring irrigation\r\nfor farm use; a mining country, rich in gold and silver, extending over\r\n150,000 square miles.\r\n\r\n6. The Sierra Nevada Mountain Range, including the Coast Range, rarely\r\nover 7,000 feet elevation, arid to semi-arid on the Eastern slopes;\r\nhumid, and supporting magnificent forest growth on the Western slopes;\r\nsome 190,000 square miles.\r\n\r\n7. The Interior Basin, lying between the two preceding mountain ranges,\r\nsome 400,000 square miles; for the most part a desert, although in parts\r\nsupporting a stunted growth of pinon and juniper, and, where irrigation\r\nis possible, productive.\r\n\r\n8. The interior valleys of the Sierra, comprising about 30,000 square\r\nmiles, which, under irrigation, have become the garden spots of the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nTo these topographic subdivisions correspond in part the climatic and\r\nthe forest conditions, although variation of soil, and of northern and\r\nsouthern climate produce further differentiation in types, and in\r\ndistribution of field and forest.\r\n\r\nThe first three sections were originally densely wooded--the great\r\nAtlantic forest region--but farms now occupy most of the arable\r\nportions; the fourth and seventh are forestless, if not treeless, while\r\nthe fifth and sixth were more or less forested--the Pacific Coast\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nFloristically also, these topographic conditions are reflected, namely\r\nin the wide, north and south distribution of species, unimpeded by\r\nintervening mountain ranges, and in the change in composition from east\r\nto west. The two grand floristic divisions of the Atlantic and the\r\nPacific forest, having but few species in common, are separated by the\r\nplains and prairies. The Atlantic forest is in the main composed of\r\nbroadleaf trees with conifers intermixed, which latter only under the\r\ninfluence of soil conditions form pure stands, as in the extensive\r\npineries of the South and North, and in the northern swamps and on\r\nsouthern mountain tops. The central region west of the Alleghanies\r\nexhibits little conifer growth in its composition, and is most widely\r\nturned to farm use. White Pine, hemlock and spruce are the important\r\nconiferous staples of the northern section, and a number of Yellow Pine\r\nspecies, with Bald Cypress and Red Cedar, are the valuable conifer\r\nspecies in the South. As regards valuable hardwoods, there is but little\r\nchange from north to south.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific forest flora is almost entirely coniferous, but here also\r\nclimatic conditions permit a distinction of two very different forest\r\nregions, the Rocky Mountain forest being mostly of rather inferior\r\ndevelopment, and the Sierra forest exhibiting the most magnificent tree\r\ngrowth in the world.\r\n\r\nNearly half the country is forestless, grassy prairie and plain, some\r\n400 million acres being of the latter description, while open prairie\r\nand brush forest, or waste land occupies 600 million acres.\r\n\r\nWithin the forest region of the East some 250 million acres have been\r\nturned into farms, leaving still two-thirds of the area either under\r\nwoods, or else wasted by fire. Although any reliable data regarding this\r\nacreage are wanting, the area of really productive woodland in this\r\nsection may probably be set down as not exceeding 300 million acres,\r\nwhich would be nearly 40% of the total area, varying from 13% in the\r\nCentral agricultural States to 50% in the Southern States; Maine, New\r\nHampshire and Arkansas being most densely wooded, with over 60%. The\r\nRocky Mountain and Sierra forests, each with 100 million acres, would\r\nbring the total productive woodland area to a round 500 million acres,\r\nor about 26% of the whole. (Later estimates including brushlands of\r\ndoubtful productive capacity, increase this area to 550 million acres.)\r\n\r\nIt is almost idle to attempt an estimate of the timber still standing\r\nready for the axe; not only are the data for such an estimate too\r\nscanty, but standards of what is considered merchantable change\r\ncontinuously and vitiate the value of such estimates. The writer’s own\r\nestimate, made some years ago, of 2,500 billion feet, which by others\r\nhas been treated as authoritative and forming a basis for predicting the\r\ntime of a timber famine, and which was lately sustained by an extensive\r\nofficial inquiry, must nevertheless be considered only as a reasonable\r\nguess, ventured for the purpose of accentuating the need of more\r\nconservative treatment of these exhaustible supplies, in comparison with\r\nthe consumption which represents around 45 billion feet B.M., and\r\naltogether 23 billion cubic feet of forest-grown material, the ultimate\r\nvalue of all forest products reaching the stupendous sum of around 1,250\r\nmillion dollars. And, as in other countries, this lavish consumption of\r\nforest growth, from five to fifteen times that of Europeans, has shown\r\nin the past a per capita increase of 30 per cent. for every decade.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the standing timber is to be found along the Pacific Coast,\r\nin the Sierra, and in the Southern States with their extensive pineries;\r\nthe Northern and Eastern sections are within measurable time of the end\r\nof their virgin supplies of saw timber. The practice of culling the most\r\nvaluable species has changed the composition in the regeneration, making\r\nit inferior, and large areas have been rendered worthless by fires.\r\n\r\nThe loss by fire, the bane of American forests, as far as loss in\r\nmaterial is concerned probably does not exceed 2 or 3 per cent. of the\r\nconsumption, and may be valued at say 25 million dollars per annum. But\r\nthe indirect damage to forest and soil, changing the composition, baring\r\nthe soil, and exposing it to erosion and washing, turning fertile lands\r\ninto wastes, and brooks and rivers into torrents, is incalculable.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that at the present rate of consumption the bulk of\r\nthe virgin supplies will be used up in a measurable time, which will\r\nforce a reduction in the use of wood materials; a more or less severe\r\ntimber famine is bound to appear,--indeed, has begun to make its\r\nappearance; and all recuperative measures will not suffice to stave it\r\noff, although they may shorten the time of its duration.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Early Forest History._\r\n\r\nThe early colonizers, settling on the Atlantic Coast soon after the\r\ndiscoveries of Columbus, did not, as is usually believed, find an\r\nuntouched virgin forest. The aboriginal Indians had, before then, hewn\r\nout their corn fields, and had supplied themselves with fuel wood and\r\nmaterial for their utensils; and fires, accidental, intentional, or\r\ncaused by lightning, had, no doubt, also made inroads here and there.\r\nThe white man, to be sure, is a more lavish wood consumer; his farms\r\nincreased more rapidly, his buildings and his fireplaces consumed more\r\nforest growth, and carelessness with fire was, as it is still, his\r\nbesetting sin. Moreover, a trade in timber with the Old World developed,\r\nin which only the best and largest-sized material figured. Wastefulness\r\nwas bred in him by the sight of plenty, and the hard work of clearing\r\nhis farm acres incited a natural enmity to the encumbering forest.\r\n\r\nThe first sawmill in the New World was erected in 1631 in the town of\r\nBerwick, Maine, and the first gang saw, of 18 saws, in 1650 in the same\r\nplace,[18] while, before that time, masts and spars, handmade cooperage\r\nstock, clapboards and shingles formed commonly parts of the return\r\ncargoes of ships. By 1680, nearly 50 vessels, engaged in such trade,\r\ncleared from the Piscataqua River. The ordinances on record which were\r\nissued at the same early times by the town governments of Exeter (1640),\r\nKittery (1656), Portsmouth (1660), and Dover (1665), restricting the use\r\nof timber, remind us of the early European forest ordinances; they were\r\nprobably not dictated by any threatening deficiency of this class of\r\nmaterial, but merely intended to secure a proper and orderly use of the\r\ntown property.\r\n\r\n  [18] See Forestry Quarterly, vol. IV, p. 14.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of a Royal Surveyor of the Woods for the New England\r\ncolonies in 1699, and the penalties imposed in New Hampshire (1708) for\r\ncutting mast trees on ungranted lands ($500 for cutting 24-inch trees),\r\nand in Massachusetts (1784) for cutting White Pine upon the public lands\r\n($100), were probably also merely police regulations, to protect\r\nproperty rights of the Crown or commonwealth. That this last move was in\r\nno way conceived as a needed conservatism is proved by the fact that two\r\nyears later the Legislature of Maine devised a lottery scheme for the\r\ndisposal of fifty townships; and 3,500,000 acres were disposed of in\r\nthis way during the twelve years following the war. Altogether the\r\nStates sacrificed their “wild lands” at trifling prices.\r\n\r\nBut, when William Penn, the founder and first legislator of the State\r\nwhich represented his grant, stipulated, in 1682, that for every five\r\nacres cleared one acre was to be reserved for forest growth by those who\r\ntook title from him, that may properly be considered an attempt to\r\ninaugurate a conservative policy, dictated by wise forethought,--an\r\nattempt, which, however, bore little or no fruit.\r\n\r\nThoughtful men probably at all times looked with pity and apprehension\r\nupon the wasteful use of the timber as they do now, yet squander went\r\non, just as it still does; but the apparently inexhaustible supplies in\r\nthose early times called for no restriction in its use.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century, a\r\nfuel-wood famine must have appeared in some parts of the country, just\r\nas in Germany at that time and for the same reasons, the wood having\r\nbeen cut along the rivers, which were the only means of transportation,\r\nand hence, the distance to which wood had to be hauled increasing the\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nThis was probably the reason why the Society of Agriculture, Arts and\r\nManufactures of New York, after an inquiry by circular letter, issued in\r\n1791, published, in 1795, a report on the “best mode of preserving and\r\nincreasing the growth of timber.” This condition probably also led the\r\nwise Governor of New York, DeWitt Clinton, of Erie Canal fame, in a\r\nmessage in 1822, to forecast an evil day, because “no system of economy”\r\nfor the reproduction of forest supplies was being adopted; and he added:\r\n“Probably none will be, until severe privations are experienced.”\r\n\r\nLike Great Britain at that time, the federal government became\r\nconcerned as regards supplies for naval construction, and, by act\r\napproved in 1799, appropriated $200,000 for the purchase of timber fit\r\nfor the Navy, and for its preservation for future use. Small purchases\r\nwere made on the Georgia coast, but nothing of importance was done\r\nuntil, in 1817, another act renewed the proposition of the first, and\r\ndirected the reservation of public lands bearing live-oak or cedar\r\ntimber suitable for the Navy, as might be selected by the President.\r\nUnder this act, a reservation of 19,000 acres was made, in 1828, on\r\nCommissioners, Cypress and Six Islands, in Louisiana. Another\r\nappropriation of $10,000 was made in 1828, and some lands were purchased\r\non Santa Rosa Sound, where, during a few years, even an attempt at\r\ncultivation was made, including sowing, transplanting, pruning, etc.\r\nThis was done under a more general act of 1827, by which the President\r\nwas authorized to take proper measures to preserve the live oak timber\r\ngrowing on the federal lands. Under these acts, altogether some 244,000\r\nacres of forest land were reserved in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nBut, although another act, of 1831, provided for the punishment of\r\npersons cutting or destroying any Live Oak, Red Cedar, or other trees\r\ngrowing on any lands of the United States, no general conception of the\r\nneed of a broad forest policy, or even of a special value attaching to\r\nthe public timberlands dictated these acts, except so far as the\r\nsecuring of certain material, then believed necessary for naval\r\nconstruction, was concerned. Indeed, the act of 1831 remained for 60\r\nyears the only expression of interest in this part of the federal\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nIn those early times, the extent of our forest domain was entirely\r\nunknown, and the concern of occasional early voices in public prints\r\nregarding a threatened exhaustion of timber supplies can only be\r\nexplained by the fact that, in the absence of railroads, the supplies\r\nnear centers of civilization, or near drivable and navigable rivers,\r\nwere alone of any account.\r\n\r\nThat the earlier propagandists of forest culture received scant\r\nattention was due to the fact that conditions soon changed; and with\r\nthese changes the evil day seemed indefinitely postponed, and the\r\nnecessity for forest culture apparently vanished. These changes were\r\nmainly wrought by the opening up of the west, by extending means of\r\ntransportation through canals and railroads, and by distributing\r\npopulation, whereby the need for near-by home supplies was overcome; a\r\ncontinental supply of apparently inexhaustible amount was brought into\r\nsight and within reach.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the population began to grow, immigrants began to pour in by\r\nthe hundred thousand, and the westward stream opened up new country and\r\nnew timber supplies, and a lumber industry of marvellous size began to\r\ndevelop. The small country mill, run in the manner of, and often in\r\nconnection with, the grist mill, doing a petty business by sawing as\r\noccasion demanded, to order for home customers or export, gave way to\r\nthe large mill establishment as we know it now; and with the development\r\nof railroad transportation and the settlement of the western country,\r\nespecially the forestless prairies, the industry grew at an astonishing\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to briefly trace the history of this industry, for the\r\nsake of which the need of conservative forest policies is essential.\r\n\r\nThat the petty method of doing business lasted until the middle of the\r\ncentury is evidenced by the census of 1840, which reported 31,560 lumber\r\nmills, with a total product valued as $12,943,507, or a little over $400\r\nper mill. By 1876, the product per mill had become $6,500; by 1890, with\r\nonly 21,000 mills, it was $19,000; in 1900, nearly the same number of\r\nmills as were recorded in 1840 (33,035) furnished a product of 566\r\nmillion dollars, and in 1907, the banner year of production, the cut of\r\n28,850 mills was reported at over 40 billion feet, and the gross product\r\nper mill had grown to $23,000, or a value for all of $666,641,367.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, 48,112 mills cut 44,509,761,000 feet valued at $684,479,859.\r\nNearly half this product came from the Southern States.\r\n\r\nIn the fifty years from 1850 to 1900, the value of all forest products\r\nharvested increased from $59 million to $567 million, and in 1907 the\r\nvalue had risen to $1,280 million, representing a consumption of over 20\r\nmillion cubic feet of forest-grown material.\r\n\r\nEspecially after the Civil War, the settlements of the West grew as if\r\nby magic; the railroad mileage more than doubled in the decade from 1865\r\nto 1875, and with it, the lumber industry developed by rapid strides\r\ninto its modern methods and volume. How rapidly the changes took place\r\nmay be judged from the fact that, in 1865, the State of New York still\r\nfurnished more lumber than any other State; now it supplies only\r\ninsignificant amounts, a little over two per cent. of the total lumber\r\ncut.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, the golden age of lumbering had arrived in Michigan; in 1871,\r\nrafts filled the Wisconsin; in 1875, Eau Claire had 30, Marathon 30, and\r\nFond du Lac 20 sawmills, now all gone; and mills at La Crosse, which\r\nwere cutting millions of feet annually, are now closed. By 1882, the\r\nSaginaw Valley had reached the climax of its production, and the lumber\r\nindustry of the great Northwest, with a cut of 8 billion feet of White\r\nPine alone, was in full blast. The White Pine production reached its\r\nmaximum in 1890, with 8.5 billion feet, then to decrease gradually but\r\nsteadily to less than half that cut in 1908. Southern development began\r\nto assume large proportions much later; at the present time, the lumber\r\nproduct of the Southern States has grown to amounts nearly double that\r\nof all the Northern States combined.\r\n\r\nBut not only the unparalleled and ever increasing wood consumption,\r\nwhich now has reached 260 cubic feet per capita, five times that of\r\nGermany and ten times that of France, threatened the exhaustion of the\r\nnatural supplies. Reckless conflagrations almost invariably followed the\r\nlumberman and destroyed generally the remaining stand, and surely the\r\nyoung growth. So common did these conflagrations become, that they were\r\nconsidered unavoidable, and though laws intended to protect forest\r\nproperty against fires were found on the statute books of every State,\r\nno attempt to enforce them was made.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that those observing this rapid decimation of our forest\r\nsupplies and the incredible wastefulness and additional destruction by\r\nfire with no attention to the aftergrowth, began again to sound the note\r\nof alarm. Besides the writings in the daily press and other non-official\r\npublications, we find the reports of the Department of Agriculture more\r\nand more frequently calling attention to the subject.\r\n\r\nIn a report issued by the Patent Office as early as 1849, we find the\r\nfollowing significant language in a discussion on the rapid destruction\r\nof forests and their influence on water flow:\r\n\r\n  “The waste of valuable timber in the United States, to say nothing\r\n  of firewood, will hardly begin to be appreciated until our\r\n  population reaches 50,000,000. Then the folly and shortsightedness\r\n  of this age will meet with a degree of censure and reproach not\r\n  pleasant to contemplate.”\r\n\r\nIn 1865, the Rev. Frederic Starr discussed fully and forcibly the\r\nAmerican forests, their destruction and preservation, in a lengthy\r\narticle in which, with truly prophetic vision, he says:\r\n\r\n  “It is feared it will be long, perhaps a full century, before the\r\n  results at which we ought to aim as a nation will be realized by our\r\n  whole country, to wit, that we should raise an adequate supply of\r\n  wood and timber for all our wants. _The evils which are anticipated\r\n  will probably increase upon us for thirty years to come with tenfold\r\n  the rapidity with which restoring or ameliorating measures shall be\r\n  adopted._”\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n  “Like a cloud no bigger than a man’s hand just rising from the sea,\r\n  an awakening interest begins to come in sight on this subject, which\r\n  as a question of political economy will place the interests of\r\n  cotton, wool, coal, iron, meat, and even grain, beneath its feet.\r\n  Some of these, according to the demand, can be produced in a few\r\n  days, others in a few months or a few years, but timber in not less\r\n  than one generation. The nation has slept because the gnawing of\r\n  want has not awakened her. She has had plenty and to spare, but\r\n  within thirty years she will be conscious that not only individual\r\n  want is present, but that it comes to each from permanent national\r\n  famine of wood.”\r\n\r\nThe article is full of interesting detail, and may be said to be the\r\nstarting basis of the campaign for better methods which followed.\r\n\r\nAnother unquestionably most influential, official report was that upon\r\n“Forests and Forestry in Germany,” by Dr. John A. Warder, United States\r\nCommissioner to the World’s Fair at Vienna in 1873. Dr. Warder set forth\r\nclearly and correctly the methods employed abroad in the use of forests,\r\nand became himself one of the most prominent propagandists for their\r\nadoption in his own country.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time appeared the classical work of George B. Marsh, our\r\nminister to Italy, “The Earth as Modified by Human Action,” in which the\r\nevil effects on cultural conditions of forest destruction were ably and\r\nforcibly pointed out.\r\n\r\nAmong these earlier publications designed to arouse public attention to\r\nthe subject, should also be mentioned General C. C. Andrews’ report on\r\n‘Forestry in Sweden,’ published by the State Department in 1872.\r\n\r\nThe Census of 1870 attempted for the first time a canvas of our forest\r\nresources under Prof. F. W. Brewer, as a result of which the relative\r\nsmallness of our forest area became known.\r\n\r\nAll these publications had their influence in educating a larger number\r\nto a conception and consideration of the importance of the subject, so\r\nthat, when, in 1873, the committee on forestry of the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science was formed and presented a\r\nmemorial to Congress, pointing out “the importance of promoting the\r\ncultivation of timber and the preservation of forests, and recommending\r\nthe appointment of a commission of forestry to report to Congress,”\r\nthere already existed an intelligent audience, and although a\r\nconsiderable amount of lethargy and lack of interest was exhibited,\r\nCongress could be persuaded, in 1876, to establish an agency in the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, out of which grew later the\r\nDivision of Forestry, a bureau of information on forestry matters. Dr.\r\nFranklin B. Hough, one of the signers of the memorial, was appointed to\r\nthe agency. It is to be noted as characteristic of much American\r\nlegislation, that this agency was secured only as a “rider” to an\r\nappropriation for the distribution of seed.\r\n\r\nWhile these were the beginnings of an official recognition of the\r\nsubject by the federal government, private enterprise and the separate\r\nStates also started about the same time to forward the movement. In\r\n1867, the agricultural and horticultural societies of Wisconsin were\r\ninvited by the legislature to appoint a committee to report on the\r\ndisastrous effects of forest destruction. In 1869, the Maine Board of\r\nAgriculture appointed a committee to report on a forest policy for the\r\nState, leading to the act of 1872 “for the encouragement of the growth\r\nof trees, exempting from taxation for twenty years lands planted to\r\ntrees, which law, as far as we know, remained without result. About the\r\nsame time a real wave of enthusiasm regarding the planting of timber\r\nseems to have pervaded the country, and especially the Western prairie\r\nStates. In addition to laws regarding the planting of trees on highways,\r\nlaws for the encouragement of timber planting, either under bounty or\r\nexemption from taxation, were passed in Iowa, Kansas and Wisconsin in\r\n1868; in Nebraska and New York in 1869; in Missouri in 1870; in\r\nMinnesota in 1871; in Iowa in 1872; in Nevada in 1873; in Illinois in\r\n1874; in Dakota and Connecticut in 1875; and finally the federal\r\ngovernment joined in this kind of legislation by the so-called\r\ntimber-culture acts of 1873 and 1874, amended in 1876 and 1877.\r\n\r\nFor the most part these laws remained a dead letter, excepting in the\r\ncase of the federal government offer. The encouragement by release from\r\ntaxes was not much of an inducement; nor does the bounty provision seem\r\nto have had greater success, except in taking money out of the\r\ntreasuries. Finally, these laws were in many or most cases repealed.\r\n\r\nThe timber-culture act was passed by Congress on March 3, 1873, by which\r\nthe planting of timber on 40 acres of land (or a proportionate area) in\r\nthe treeless territory, conferred the title to 160 acres (or a\r\nproportionate amount) of the public domain. This law had not been in\r\nexistence ten years when its repeal was demanded, and this was finally\r\nsecured in 1891, the reason being that, partly owing to the crude\r\nprovisions of the law, and partly to the lack of proper supervision, it\r\nhad been abused, and had given rise to much fraud in obtaining title to\r\nlands under false pretenses. It is difficult to say how much impetus the\r\nlaw gave to _bonafide_ forest planting, and how much timber growth has\r\nresulted from it. Unfavorable climate, lack of satisfactory plant\r\nmaterial, and lack of knowledge as to the proper methods, led to many\r\nfailures.\r\n\r\nA number of railroad companies, opening up the prairie States, planted\r\nat this time groves along the right of way for the sake of demonstrating\r\nthe practicability of securing forest growth on the treeless prairies\r\nand plains.\r\n\r\nThere was also considerable planting of wind-breaks and groves on\r\nhomesteads, which was attended with better results. Altogether, however,\r\nthe amount of tree planting, even in the prairies and plains, was\r\ninfinitesimal, if compared with what is necessary for climatic\r\namelioration; and it may be admitted, now as well as later, that the\r\nreforestation of the plains must be a matter of co-operative, if not of\r\nnational, enterprise.\r\n\r\nAt this time also, an effort was made to stimulate enthusiasm for tree\r\nplanting among the homesteaders and settlers on the plains by the\r\nestablishment of arbor days. From its inception by Governor J. Sterling\r\nMorton, and its first inauguration by the State Board of Agriculture of\r\nNebraska in 1872, Arbor Day gradually became a day of observance in\r\nnearly every State. While with the exception of the so-called treeless\r\nStates, perhaps not much planting of economic value is done, the\r\nobservance of the day in schools as one set apart for the discussion of\r\nthe importance of trees, forests and forestry has been productive of an\r\nincreased interest in the subject. Arbor days have perhaps also had a\r\nretarding influence upon the practical forestry movement, in leading\r\npeople into the misconception that forestry consists in tree planting,\r\nin diverting attention from the economic question of the proper use of\r\nexisting forest areas, in bringing into the discussion poetry and\r\nemotions, which have clouded the hard-headed practical issues, and\r\ndelayed the earnest attention of practical business men.\r\n\r\nPrivate efforts in the East in the way of fostering and carrying on\r\neconomic timber planting should not be forgotten, such as the offering\r\nof prizes by the Massachusetts Society for the Promotion of Agriculture\r\n(as early as 1804 and again in 1876), and the planting done by private\r\nland holders at Cape Cod, in Rhode Island, Virginia, and elsewhere.\r\nThese efforts, to be sure, were only sporadic and unsystematic, and on\r\nno scale commensurate with the destruction of virgin forest resources.\r\n\r\nA touching attempt of two noble Frenchmen to teach their American hosts\r\na better use of their magnificent forest resource, although of little\r\nresult, should never fail of mention. André Michaux and his son, André\r\nFrancois, who, between 1785 and 1805, explored and studied the forest\r\nflora of the United States, and published a magnificent North American\r\nSylva in three volumes, left, in recognition of the hospitalities\r\nreceived, two legacies of $20,000 for the “extension and progress of\r\nagriculture and more especially of silviculture in the United States,”\r\nwhich bequests became available in 1870. The American Philosophical\r\nSociety at Philadelphia, a trustee of one of the legacies, has devoted\r\nits income to beautification of Fairmount Park, providing a few lectures\r\non forest botany and forestry, and collecting a forestry library, while\r\nthe other legacy has been used by the Massachusetts Society for the\r\nPromotion of Agriculture to aid the botanical gardens at Harvard and the\r\nArnold Arboretum, besides offering the prizes for tree planting referred\r\nto above.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Development of a Forest Policy._\r\n\r\nThis first period of desultory efforts to create public opinion on\r\nbehalf of a more conservative use of forest resources was followed by a\r\nmore systematic propaganda, in which the Division of Forestry, growing\r\nout of the agency in the Department of Agriculture, took the lead. This\r\nit did officially as well as by assisting the American Forestry\r\nAssociation, soon after organized with a view of educating public\r\nopinion. For 15 years, the chief of the Division acted either as\r\nSecretary or Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Association.\r\n\r\nThe first forestry association had been formed on January 12, 1876, in\r\nSt. Paul, Minn., largely through the efforts of Leonard B. Hodges, who\r\nwas the first to make plantations in the prairies for the St. Paul and\r\nPacific Railroad. This association was aided by State appropriations,\r\nwhich enabled it to offer premiums for the setting out of plantations,\r\nto distribute plant material, and also to publish and distribute widely\r\na Tree Planters’ Manual, revised editions of which were issued from time\r\nto time.\r\n\r\nIn 1875, Dr. John A. Warder issued a call for a convention in Chicago\r\nto form a national forestry association. This association was completed,\r\nin 1876, at Philadelphia, but never showed any life or growth.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, a number of patriotic citizens at Cincinnati called together a\r\nforestry congress, incited thereto by the visit and representations of\r\nBaron von Steuben, a Prussian forest official, when visiting this\r\ncountry on the occasion of the centennial celebration of the surrender\r\nof Yorktown.\r\n\r\nA very enthusiastic and representative gathering, on April 25, was the\r\nresult, lasting through the week, which led to the formation of the\r\nAmerican Forestry Congress. In the same year, in August, a second\r\nmeeting was held in Montreal, under the patronage of the Canadian\r\ngovernment, and the name was changed to the American Forestry\r\nAssociation. In 1898, it began the publication of a propagandist\r\njournal, The Forester (later changed to Forestry and Irrigation then to\r\nConservation, and now again to American Forestry). It has now a\r\nmember-ship of over 5,000. Much of the early educational propaganda was\r\ndone through this association. Indeed, this association, holding yearly\r\nand intermediate meetings in different parts of the States, became the\r\ncenter of all private efforts to advance the forestry movement. Twelve\r\nvolumes of its proceedings contain not only the history of progress in\r\nestablishing a forest policy, but also much other information of value\r\non forestry subjects.\r\n\r\nOther local or State forestry associations were formed from time to\r\ntime, more or less under the lead of the national association, and exist\r\nnow in almost every State, while several other societies, like the\r\nSierra Nevada Club and the Mazamas of the Pacific coast, and State\r\nhorticultural societies in various States, made the subject one to be\r\ndiscussed and to be fostered. The most active of these associations,\r\nsince it was formed in 1886, publishing also a bi-monthly journal,\r\nForest Leaves (at first less frequently), is the Pennsylvania State\r\nForestry Association, which has succeeded in thoroughly committing its\r\nState to a proper forest policy, as far as official recognition is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nUsually as a result of this associated private effort, the States\r\nappointed forestry commissions or commissioners. These commissions were\r\nat first for the most part instituted for inquiry and to make reports,\r\nupon which a forest policy for the State might be framed. Others have\r\nbecome permanent parts of the State organization, with executive, or\r\nmerely educational functions. Such commissioners of inquiry were\r\nappointed at various times, in Connecticut (1877), New Hampshire (1881\r\nand 1889), Vermont (1882), New York (1884), Maine (1891), New Jersey (in\r\nGeological Survey 1894), Pennsylvania (1893), North Carolina (in\r\nGeological Survey 1891), Ohio (1885), Michigan (1899), Wisconsin (1897),\r\nMinnesota (1899), North Dakota (1891), Colorado (1885), California\r\n(1885).\r\n\r\nIt was but natural in a democratic country that these movements\r\nsometimes became the play balls of self-seeking men, political wire\r\npullers, and grafters, or more often of ignorant amateurs and shallow\r\nsentimentalists, aided by half-informed newspaper writers. Infinite\r\npatience was required to steer through these rocks the ship of true\r\neconomic reform, and to educate legislators and constituents to its true\r\nneeds. The very first forestry congress was really conceived with a view\r\nof advancing political preferment of one of its organizers, and many\r\nanother “forestry” meeting was utilized for a similar purpose, the new,\r\ncatchy title attracting the gullible.\r\n\r\nOne of the first State forest commissions, well endowed to do its work,\r\nsoon fell into the hands of grafters, and created such scandals that\r\nthey led to its abolishment, and to a set-back in the movement\r\neverywhere. Arbor day sentimentalism discredited and clouded the issue\r\nbefore the business world; the movement was in constant danger at the\r\nhands of its friends. Antagonism of the lumber world was aroused by the\r\nfalse idea of what the reform contemplated, and, in the absence of\r\ntechnically trained foresters to instruct the public and the amateur\r\nreformers, and to convince legislators of the absolute need of\r\ndiscontinuing old established habits, progress was naturally slow, and\r\nexperienced many setbacks.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard field to plow, grown up with the weed growth of prejudice\r\nand custom, and means and tools for the work were inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe federal government was naturally looked to to take the lead. The\r\nfirst two agents, employed in the Department of Agriculture to “report\r\non forestry”, unfortunately lacked all technical knowledge of the\r\nsubject, the first, a most assiduous worker, being a writer of local\r\nhistories and gatherer of statistics, the second a preacher. The third,\r\nthe writer himself, had at least the advantage of this technical\r\ntraining, but, at the same time, the disadvantage of being a foreigner,\r\nwho had first to learn the limitations of democratic government. Only\r\nthe paltry sum of $8,000 was at his disposal for plowing the ground, and\r\neven after the agency had been raised to the dignity of a Division in\r\n1886, for years no adequate appropriations could be secured, and hence\r\nthe scope and usefulness of the work of the Division was hampered.\r\n\r\nThe Forestry Association, inaugurated with such a flourish of trumpets\r\nand with such a large membership at the start, had in the first two\r\nyears dwindled to a small number of faithful ones, and was without funds\r\nwhen the writer became its secretary.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these drawbacks, the propaganda had progressed so far in\r\n1891, that, through the earnest insistence of the then Secretary of the\r\nInterior, John W. Noble, who had been won over to the views for which\r\nthe Division and the Association stood, a clause was enacted by Congress\r\nin “An act to repeal timber-culture laws and for other purposes,” giving\r\nauthority to the President to set aside forest reservations from the\r\npublic domain. Again, this important legislation, which changed the\r\nentire land policy and all previous notions of the government’s\r\nfunctions concerning the Public Domain, was not deliberately enacted,\r\nbut slipped in as a “rider”, at the last hour, in Conference Committee.\r\nIn this connection the name of Edward A. Bowers, in 1887 Special Agent\r\nin the Department of the Interior, and later Assistant Commissioner of\r\nthe General Land Office, deserves mention as most active in securing\r\nthis reservation policy.\r\n\r\nActing under this authority, Presidents Harrison and Cleveland\r\nproclaimed, previous to 1894, seventeen forest reservations, with a\r\ntotal estimated area of 17,500,000 acres.\r\n\r\nThe reservations were established usually upon the petition of citizens\r\nresiding in the respective States and after due examination, the\r\nForestry Association acting both as instigator and as intermediary.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile no provision for the administration of the reserves existed,\r\nand the comprehensive legislation devised by the Chief of the Division\r\nof Forestry, which included withdrawal and administration of all public\r\ntimberlands, failed to be enacted, although in the Fifty-third Congress\r\nit was passed by both Houses, but failed to become a law merely for lack\r\nof time to secure a conference report. But the purpose of the advocates\r\nof forestry was to create such a condition as would compel Congress to\r\nact, by continually withdrawing forested lands that would lie useless\r\nuntil authority was given for their proper use and administration.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure influential support from outside, a committee of the\r\nForestry Association induced the then Secretary of the Interior, Hoke\r\nSmith, in 1896, to request the National Academy of Sciences, the legally\r\nconstituted adviser of the government in scientific matters, to\r\ninvestigate and report “upon the inauguration of a rational forest\r\npolicy for the forested lands of the United States.” After an\r\nunnecessary so-called “junket” of a committee of the Academy to\r\ninvestigate the public timberlands, a preliminary report was submitted\r\nrecommending the creation of thirteen additional reservations, with an\r\narea of over 20 million acres, and later a complete report was made\r\nwith practically the same recommendations which had been urged by the\r\nForestry Association.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland, heroically, proclaimed the desired reserves all on\r\none day, Washington’s birthday, 1897, without the usual preliminary\r\nascertainment of local interests, and immediately a storm broke loose in\r\nthe United States Senate, which threatened the overthrow of the entire,\r\ntoilsomely achieved reservation policy; and impeachment of the President\r\nwas strongly argued in a two-day (Sunday) session. Congress, however,\r\ncame to an end on March 4, before it had taken any action, but, as it\r\nhad also failed to pass the annual Sundry Civil Appropriation Bill, it\r\nwas immediately recalled in extra session.\r\n\r\nThen, again, by a clever trick and in an indirect and surreptitious\r\nmanner, instead of by open, direct and straightforward consideration and\r\ndeliberation of a proper policy, most important legislation was secured\r\nin the Sundry Civil Appropriation Bill, which provided for the temporary\r\nsuspension of the reservations lately set aside until they could be more\r\ndefinitely delimited, private claims adjusted, and agricultural lands\r\nexcluded, by a survey, for which $150,000 was appropriated to the United\r\nStates Geological Survey. The agricultural lands were then to be\r\nreturned to the public domain for disposal. At the same time, provisions\r\nfor the administration of the remaining reservations, much in the sense\r\nof the legislation advocated by the Division of Forestry and by the\r\nForestry Association, and especially for the sale of timber, were hung\r\non to this appropriation clause. Under this act the reserves were\r\nadministered until 1904.\r\n\r\nIf the interior history of this bit of legislation were revealed, it\r\nwould probably appear that, not conception of the importance of the\r\nsubject, but the need for the employment of a certain organized survey\r\nparty in the Geological Survey was at the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nWhile this law had set aside one year and a limited sum to accomplish\r\nthe survey, this could not, of course, be done, and hence appropriations\r\nwere continued, and the date for the segregation of the lands was\r\ndeferred _sine die_. For years this forest survey continued, giving rise\r\nto magnificent volumes, issued from the Geological Survey, describing\r\nthe forest reservations--a very useful, educational piece of work, not\r\nat all contemplated by the legislation--for which not less than $1.5\r\nmillion have been expended. By 1905 some 110,000 square miles had been\r\nexamined when this work was handed over to the Forestry Bureau.\r\n\r\nThus it happened, almost by accident, that finally the aims of the\r\nreformers were realized, the appointment of forest superintendents,\r\nrangers, etc., to take charge of the forest reservations was secured,\r\nand rules and regulations for their administration were formulated by\r\nthe Commissioner of the General Land Office, marking the beginning of a\r\nsettled policy on the part of the United States government to take care\r\nof its long neglected forest lands. In this work of first organization\r\nthe name of Filibert Roth, a German-born forester, deserves mention.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Division of Forestry had continued to bring together and\r\ndistribute in the shape of reports, bulletins, circulars, addresses and\r\nletters, such information useful for the education of the public, of\r\nwood consumers, and timberland owners, as its limited appropriations\r\npermitted, undertaking also some scientific investigations, especially\r\nin the line of timber physics.\r\n\r\nSoon after, in July, 1898, when the writer resigned his position as\r\nChief of the Division of Forestry, to organize the first professional\r\nforest school, the New York State College of Forestry, Mr. Gifford\r\nPinchot, took charge of the division. Young, ambitious, aggressive, with\r\nsome knowledge of forestry acquired in Europe and with influential\r\nconnections and a large fortune, he easily secured the first need for\r\neffective sowing on the well-plowed field before him--appropriations.\r\nWhatever had been feebly begun could be broadly, sometimes lavishly,\r\nextended, and the new idea of making “working plans” for private\r\ntimberland owners could be developed--a great educational work, which,\r\nearlier, when even co-operation with State institutions was considered a\r\nquestionable proposition, would have been turned down as too paternal.\r\n\r\nIn five years the appropriations had increased tenfold, to over\r\n$250,000; and in the first decade of the new regime, around $3,000,000\r\nhad been spent on forestry investigations, not counting expenditures on\r\nforest reservation account.\r\n\r\nA further strong support came into the field, when Mr. Roosevelt became\r\nPresident of the United States, in 1901, and unreservedly threw his\r\noverpowering influence into the balance, to advance forest policies.\r\n\r\nOwing to his interest, the withdrawal of public timberlands from entry\r\nproceeded at a rapid rate: by 1902, the reservations had grown to 65\r\nmillion acres; in 1905, there were over 100 million acres included; and\r\nby the end of his administration, 175 million acres had been placed in\r\nreservation.\r\n\r\nThe anomalous condition, which placed the survey of the forest reserves\r\nin the Geological Survey, their administration in the Land Office, and\r\nthe scientific or technical development of forestry in the Department of\r\nAgriculture, was finally ended in 1904, when, on February 1st, the whole\r\nmatter was placed in the hands of the Department of Agriculture, with\r\nits Forestry Division, which had been changed into a Bureau of Forestry,\r\nand then changed its name again to Forest Service.\r\n\r\nWith this transfer, it may be said, the federal forest policy was fully\r\nestablished, at least for its own lands, and all that remains to be done\r\nis the perfection of details in their administration and the development\r\nof silvicultural methods.\r\n\r\nWith appropriations which now (1907) exceed $950,000 for investigating\r\nwork alone, limitless opportunity seems to be open to extend the many\r\ndirections of inquiry and solve the silvicultural problems, and satisfy\r\nthe educational function of this government agency.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the administration of the federal timberlands and the\r\neducational and other assistance of private owners, a further expansion\r\nof the Forest Service is developing under the paternalistic and\r\nsocialistic tendencies referred to before, which may ultimately lead to\r\nthe purchase and federal control of forest reserves in the Eastern\r\nStates. Such expansion, was, indeed, proposed in the establishment of\r\nreserves in the White Mountains and the Southern Appalachians,\r\npropositions which have been resisted by Congress for the last seven\r\nyears, but with ever weakening resistance. Finally in 1910, success was\r\nattained, and the federal government placed in position to acquire these\r\nforest areas, to the amount of $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the single states have begun to develop their own policies.\r\n\r\nOutside of legislation aiming at protection against forest fires--which\r\nnearly every State possessed from early times, ineffective for lack of\r\nmachinery to carry it into effect--and outside of the futile attempts to\r\nencourage timber planting referred to, no interest in timberlands was\r\nevinced by State authorities for the first two-thirds of the century,\r\nsince practically all these lands had been disposed of to private\r\nowners, and the authorities did not see any further duties regarding\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe first State to institute a commission of inquiry was Wisconsin, in\r\n1867; but with the rendering of the report, prepared by I. A. Lapham,\r\none of the active early propagandists--the matter was allowed to mature\r\nfor thirty years.\r\n\r\nThe next State to move, in a feeble way, in 1876, was Minnesota, the\r\nlegislature making an annual grant of money to its forestry\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of commissions of inquiry then became fashionable.\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire appointed such a commission in 1881, which reported in\r\n1885, without result, and another commission in 1889, whose report, in\r\n1893, led to the establishment of a permanent commission of inquiry and\r\nadvice, with a partial supervision of forest fire laws. Vermont followed\r\nsuit with a commission of inquiry, in 1882, whose report made in 1884,\r\nremained without consequences.\r\n\r\nIn Michigan the expedient was resorted to of constituting the State\r\nBoard of Agriculture a commission of inquiry, whose report, published in\r\n1888, had also no consequences except those of an educational character.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the State of Massachusetts ordered the State Board of\r\nAgriculture in 1890, to inquire “into the consideration of the forests\r\nof the State, the need and methods of their protection,” with similar\r\nresults, or lack of result.\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey, the matter was referred to the State Geologist, who,\r\nsince 1894, has made reports on forest conditions and needs. Similar\r\nreference of the subject was made in the State of North Carolina, in\r\n1891, and in West Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe first more permanent State institution deliberately established as\r\nan educational and advisory agent was the Forestry Bureau of Ohio, in\r\n1885, which published a number of annual reports, but eventually\r\ncollapsed for lack of support.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, three important States, New York in the East, Colorado\r\nin the Middle States, and California in the West, seemed simultaneously\r\nto have awakened to their duty, largely as a result of the propaganda of\r\nthe American Forestry Association.\r\n\r\nIn California, a State Board of Forestry was instituted, with\r\nconsiderable power and ample appropriations, which, however, eventually\r\nfell into the hands of unscrupulous politicians and grafters, the\r\nresulting scandals leading to its abolishment in 1889.\r\n\r\nIn Colorado, which when admitted to Statehood in 1876, had, in its\r\nConstitution, directed the general assembly to legislate on behalf of\r\nthe forestry interests of the State, these interests were rather tardily\r\ncommitted to a forest commissioner, who was charged to organize county\r\ncommissioners and road overseers throughout the State as forest officers\r\nin their respective localities, to act as a police force in preventing\r\ndepredations on timbered school lands and in enforcing the fire laws.\r\nCol. E.T. Ensign, who had been most instrumental in bringing about this\r\nlegislation, was appointed commissioner, and, with singular devotion, in\r\nspite of the enmity aroused by his activity, which eventually led to a\r\ndiscontinuance of appropriations, tried, for a number of years to\r\nexecute this law. With his resignation from the office, this legislation\r\nalso fell into innocuous desuetude.\r\n\r\nIn New York, concern in the water supply for the Erie Canal, had led\r\nsuch a far sighted statesman as Horatio Seymour, twice Governor of the\r\nState and once running for the Presidency, to conceive the need of\r\npreserving the Adirondack watershed in State hands. Accordingly a law\r\nwas passed, in 1872, naming seven citizens, with Horatio Seymour\r\nchairman, as State park commission, instructed to make inquiries with\r\nthe view of reserving or appropriating the wild lands lying northward of\r\nthe Mohawk, or so much thereof as might be deemed expedient, for a State\r\npark. The commission, finding that the State then owned only 40,000\r\nacres in that region, and that there was a tendency on the part of the\r\nowners of the rest to combine for the enhancement of values should the\r\nState want to buy, recommended a law forbidding further sales of State\r\nlands, and their retention when forfeited for the non-payment of taxes.\r\n\r\nIt was not until eleven years later, in 1883, that this recommendation\r\nwas acted upon, when the State through the non-payment of taxes by the\r\nowners of cut-over lands had become possessed of 600,000 acres.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, the comptroller was authorized to employ “such experts as he\r\nmay deem necessary to investigate and report a system of forest\r\npreservation.” The report of a commission of four members was made in\r\n1885, but the legislation proposed was antagonized by the lumbermen’s\r\ninterests. The legislature finally passed a compromise bill, which the\r\nwriter had drafted at the request of Senator Lowe, entitled “An act\r\nestablishing a forest commission, and to define its powers, and for the\r\npreservation of forests,” the most comprehensive legislation at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe original forest commission, appointed under the act of 1885, was\r\nsuperseded in 1895, by the commission of fisheries, game, and forests,\r\nwhich brought allied interests under the control of a single board of\r\nfive members appointed by the Governor for a term of five years. In\r\n1903, the commission was changed to a single commissioner, and another\r\nbackward step was taken in 1911 by handing over the work of this\r\ncommissioner to the newly created State Conservation Commission,\r\nconsolidating with it several other commissions.\r\n\r\nHere, then, for the first time on the American continent, had the idea\r\nof State forestry, management of State lands on forestry principles,\r\ntaken shape; a new doctrine of State functions had gained the day. Not\r\nonly was the commission charged to organize a service, with a “chief\r\nforester” and “underforesters,” to administer the existing reserve\r\naccording to forestry principles, but also from the incomes to lay aside\r\na fund for the purchase of more lands to constitute the State forest\r\npreserve. Unfortunately, instability of purpose, the characteristic of\r\ndemocracy, spoiled the dream of the forester. Both, commission and chief\r\nforester were, of course, political appointees, and, rightly or wrongly,\r\nfell under the suspicion, when proposing the sale of stumpage, that they\r\nwere working into the hands of lumbermen. A set of well-meaning but\r\nill-advised civic reformers succeeded, in 1893, in securing the\r\ninsertion into the Constitution, then being revised, of a clause\r\npreventing the cutting of trees, dead or alive, on State lands,\r\ndeclaring that they shall forever be kept as “wild lands.” Later, this\r\nconstitutional provision was deliberately set aside by the commission,\r\nwhich began to plant up some of the fire-wasted areas, the legislature\r\nappropriating money for this breach of the Constitution because it was\r\npopular: and lately permission has also been granted by the legislature\r\nto remove trees from burnt areas in order to reduce the fire danger--the\r\nfoolish objection of a Constitution notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, new legislation was passed to authorize the State to purchase\r\nadditional forest lands within a prescribed limit, to round off the\r\nState’s holdings, a special agency, the Forest Preserve Board, being\r\nconstituted for that purpose. Under this law, some $3,500,000 have been\r\nspent, and by 1907, over one and a half million acres had been added to\r\nthe State Forest Preserve. This large area is withdrawn from rational\r\neconomic use, reserved for a pleasure ground of wealthy New Yorkers, who\r\nhave located their camps in the “wilderness” under the avowed assumption\r\nthat the State can be forced to maintain forever this anomalous\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nIn later years, private planting has been encouraged by the Commission\r\nselling plant material from the State nurseries at low rates.\r\n\r\nThe most important administrative function of the Commission has been\r\nthe reduction of forest fires, in which, also owing to political\r\nconditions, only partial success has been attained. The legislation of\r\n1885 for the first time attacked this problem in a more thorough manner,\r\nproviding for the organization of a service, and this served as an\r\nexample to other States who copied and improved on it. Notably the\r\nforest fire legislation of Maine (1891), of Wisconsin (1895), and of\r\nMinnesota (1895) was based on this model.\r\n\r\nAnother of the large States to start upon and, differently from New\r\nYork, to develop consistently a proper forest policy, was the State of\r\nPennsylvania. As a result of a persistent propaganda by the Pennsylvania\r\nForestry Association, formed in 1886, and especially by its active\r\nsecretary, Dr. J. T. Rothrock, a commission of inquiry was instituted in\r\n1893. Before its report was established, the legislature of 1895\r\nprovided for an executive Department of Agriculture, and included in its\r\norganization a provision for a Division of Forestry, the botanist member\r\nof the previous commission, Dr. Rothrock, being appointed Commissioner\r\nof Forestry at the head of the Division. Two years later, the final\r\nlegislation, which firmly established a forest policy for the State, was\r\npassed namely for the purchase of State forest reservations. All later\r\nlegislation was simply an expansion of these propositions. By 1910, the\r\nState had acquired by purchase, wild, mostly culled lands to the extent\r\nof over 900,000 acres, and the Commission had progressed far towards\r\nproviding for their management and recuperation.\r\n\r\nThe unusually disastrous conflagrations of 1894; the growing conviction\r\nthat the pleaders of the exhaustibility of timber supplies were right,\r\naccentuated by a rapid decline in White Pine production and a rapid,\r\nand, indeed, almost sudden, rise in stumpage prices; the example which\r\nthe federal government had set in withdrawing public timberlands from\r\nspoliation; together with an increasing number, not only of advocates of\r\nsaner methods, but of technically educated men, who came from the\r\nschools lately organized--all these influences had worked as a leaven in\r\nall parts of the country so as to bring in the new century with a\r\nrealization of the seriousness of the situation. And, within the first\r\nseven years of the century, the change of attitude, at least, was almost\r\ncompleted in all parts of the country, and among all classes, the\r\nlumbermen and others depending directly on wood supplies becoming\r\nespecially prominent in recognizing the need and value of forestry.\r\n\r\nState after State came into line in recognizing that it had a duty to\r\nperform, and in some way gave expression to this recognition, so that,\r\nby 1908, hardly a State was without at least a germ of a forest policy.\r\n\r\nTwo principles had been recognized as correct and were brought into\r\npractice, namely, that the forest interests of the State called for\r\ndirect State activity, and that eventually the State must own and manage\r\nat least portions of the forest area. The first principle took shape in\r\nappointing single State foresters, [as in Maine (1891 and 1903); in\r\nMassachusetts (1904); in Connecticut (1903); in Vermont (1906); in Rhode\r\nIsland (1906)]; or Commissions or Boards [as in New York (1885), changed\r\nto a single commissioner with Superintendent and State foresters in\r\n1903; in Pennsylvania (1901); in New Hampshire (1893); Maryland with a\r\nState forester (1905); Wisconsin, with a State forester (1905); Indiana\r\n(1901-03); Louisiana, with a State forester (1904); Michigan (1899);\r\nMinnesota (1899); California (revived, with a State forester, in 1905);\r\nWashington, with a State forester (1905); Kentucky (1906); in New\r\nJersey, with a State forester (1904); Alabama (1907).]\r\n\r\nA very important feature in these appointments was the fact, that, more\r\nand more professional or technically educated men displaced the merely\r\npolitical appointees, or were at least added to the commissions.\r\n\r\nThe idea of State forests found expression, more or less definitely, in\r\nsetting aside forest reservations or else in enabling the State to\r\naccept and administer donations of forest lands. Among the States\r\nrecognizing this principle were New Hampshire, Connecticut, New Jersey,\r\nMichigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana, California.\r\n\r\nWhere neither of these two principles had as yet found application, at\r\nleast some agency was established to give advice and investigate or\r\nexperiment in matters of forest interests, and sometimes to offer\r\nassistance to private woodland owners or planters, as in Delaware, Ohio,\r\nNorth Carolina, etc.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, largely through the influence and with the co-operation of\r\nthe federal Bureau of Forestry, private owners had begun, if not to\r\napply, at least to study the possibility of the application of forestry\r\nto their holdings. The Bureau prepared “working plans” which were now\r\nand then followed in part, or at least led to attempts at a more\r\nconservative method of logging. Notably, various paper and pulp\r\nmanufacturers realized the usefulness of more systematic attention and\r\nconservative methods in the use of their properties. In this connection\r\nthe object lesson furnished by Mr. G. K. Vanderbilt on his Biltmore\r\nEstate in North Carolina, which was begun by Mr. Pinchot and conducted\r\nby Dr. C. A. Schenck, a German forester, requires special mention as the\r\nfirst, and for nearly 20 years continued experiment in applying forestry\r\nmethods systematically in America. At present writing the continuance\r\nof this experiment is in doubt.\r\n\r\nWith the second decade of the century, we shall enter upon the flood\r\ntide of development, when no more need of argument for its necessity,\r\nand only the question of practicable methods, will occupy us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo far, silviculturally, the selection forest, i.e., culling the best\r\nand the stoutest, practiced hitherto by the lumberman, without reference\r\nto reproduction, but carried on somewhat more conservatively, is still\r\nthe method advocated in most cases by the Forest Service. This so-called\r\nconservative lumbering is, to be sure, the transition to better methods.\r\nAccording to reports of the federal Forest Service in 1907, some million\r\nacres of private timberland were under forest management or\r\nconservatively lumbered.\r\n\r\nPlanting of waste or logged lands, as distinguished from planting in the\r\nprairies, which had, sporadically and in a small way, been done by\r\nindividuals here and there for many years, is practised in ever\r\nincreasing amount, both by State administrations and by private owners;\r\nthe New York State College of Forestry starting such planting in its\r\nCollege Forest on a larger scale and systematically, in 1899. At present\r\nwriting, the forestry department of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company is\r\nperhaps the largest single planter in the country, having set out over\r\nfour million trees (by 1910), with the avowed purpose of growing\r\nrailroad ties.\r\n\r\nBy 1908, popular interest in forest conservation had become so keen, and\r\nat the same time paternalistic tendencies so fully developed by the\r\nRoosevelt administration--the federal government having entered upon\r\nextensive plans of reclaiming lands by irrigation, and preparing to\r\ndevelop water powers, and inland waterways,--that the time seemed ripe\r\nto bring all these conservative forces into unity.\r\n\r\nThe President called together in conference the governors of all the\r\nStates with their advisers, together with the presidents of the various\r\nnational societies interested, and others, to discuss the broad question\r\nof the conservation of natural resources.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence national and State Conservation Associations and\r\nCommissions were formed in all parts of the Union, and a new era of\r\nactive interest in economic development seems to have arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Education and Literature._\r\n\r\nThe primary education of the people at large and of their governments in\r\nparticular, the propaganda for the economic reform contemplated by the\r\nforestry movement, was carried on, as stated, by the federal Division of\r\nForestry and especially by the forestry associations, which sprang up in\r\nall parts of the country, by means of their annual and special meetings,\r\naided by the general press and sometimes by special publications.\r\n\r\nThe first _Journal of Forestry_, a monthly publication, ventured into\r\nthe world as a private enterprise, edited by Dr. Hough, soon after the\r\nForestry Congress in Cincinnati, but it survived just one year,\r\nvanishing for lack of readers. This was followed by irregularly\r\nappearing _Forestry Bulletins_, of which the writer prepared four under\r\nthe aegis of the American Forestry Association.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, the Pennsylvania Forestry Association began the publication of\r\na bi-monthly journal, _Forest Leaves_, which has persisted to this day.\r\nIn 1895, Dr. John Gifford launched another bi-monthly, the _New Jersey\r\nForester_, soon to change its name to _The Forester_, and under that\r\nname, three years later, taken over by the American Forestry\r\nAssociation, continued as _Forestry and Irrigation_, changed to\r\n_Conservation_ and now again changed to _American Forestry_. Now, half a\r\ndozen or more similar publications emanate from the various State\r\nAssociations. In this connection there should not be forgotten the\r\njournal, _Garden and Forest_, edited by Professor C. S. Sargent, which\r\nfor ten years, from 1888 to 1897, did much to enlighten the public on\r\nforestry matters.\r\n\r\nSome provision for technical education was made long before opportunity\r\nfor its application had arisen, and, indeed, before any professional\r\nforesters were in existence to do the teaching. The new doctrine\r\nattracted the attention of educational institutions, and the desire to\r\nassist in the popular movement led to the introduction of the subject,\r\nat least by name, into their curricula; the professor of botany or of\r\nhorticulture, adding “forestry” to his title, and explaining in a few\r\nlectures the objects, and, as far as he knew them, the methods of\r\nforestry; or, at least some lectures on dendrology and forest geography\r\nwere introduced in the botanical courses. By 1897, twenty\r\ninstitutions--land grant colleges--had in this way introduced the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first attempt to present systematically a whole course of\r\ntechnical forestry matter to a class of students was a series of twelve\r\nlectures, delivered by the writer, at the Massachusetts College of\r\nAgriculture in 1887, and another to students of political economy at\r\nWisconsin University in 1897.\r\n\r\nThe era of professional forest schools, however, was, inaugurated in\r\n1898, when the writer organized the New York State College of Forestry\r\nat Cornell University, and almost simultaneously Dr. Schenck opened a\r\nprivate school at Biltmore.\r\n\r\nA year later, another Forest school was opened at Yale University, an\r\nendowment of the Pinchots, father and sons. In 1903, the University of\r\nMichigan added a professional department of forestry, and then followed\r\na real flood of educational enthusiasm, one institution after another\r\nseeing the necessity for adding the subject as an integral part to its\r\ncourses. Before there were enough competent men in the field, some\r\ntwenty colleges or universities called for teachers, besides private\r\ninstitutions. An inevitable result of this over-production of forest\r\nschools and of foresters all at once must be an overcrowding of the\r\nprofession with mediocre men before the profession is really fully\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nBrief reference to the history of the first school, established by the\r\nState of New York, may be of interest, as exemplifying in a striking\r\nmanner the political troubles besetting reforms under republican\r\nconditions. But for a similar occurrence in France (see p. 242), this\r\ncase might be unique in the history of educational institutions.\r\nAlthough the school thrived almost beyond expectation, having in its\r\nfourth year attained in numbers to 70, larger than any French or German\r\nforest school at the time, and readily finding employment for its\r\ngraduates, it suddenly came to an end in 1903. Its appropriation,\r\nunanimously voted in the Legislature, was vetoed by the Governor, on the\r\nalleged ground that the silvicultural methods applied in the\r\ndemonstration forest of the College “had been subjected to grave\r\ncriticism.” It is true the only silvicultural method officially\r\nsanctioned (by the Forest Service), the selection forest, had not been\r\napplied, yet the war against the College being waged by two wealthy\r\nbankers of New York and the well-known character of the then Governor\r\nsuggest that other “considerations” than mere criticism of professional\r\njudgment were at the bottom of his action.\r\n\r\nAs from the start, the federal Forestry Bureau naturally continued in\r\never increasing degree to be the educator of the nation, not only as\r\nregards popular conceptions and attitudes, but as regards technical\r\nmatter. Its bulletins, circulars, and reports on the subjects which come\r\nunder investigation form the bulk of the American literature on the\r\ntechnical side of the subject. During the first 20 years of its\r\nexistence, some 20,000 pages of printed matter were produced, and the\r\nnext decade increased the crop of information apace. At first intended\r\nfor popular propaganda, the matter printed was naturally argumentative,\r\nstatistical and descriptive, but gradually more and more technical\r\nmatter filled the pages, and now most of the publications are of\r\ntechnical nature.\r\n\r\nOne of the first extensive and important lines of investigation\r\nundertaken by the Division was that into the characteristics and\r\nstrength, the timber physics, of American woods, which in its\r\ncomprehensiveness commanded the admiration of even the Germans, and gave\r\nrise to a series of reports. The biology of American species, more or\r\nless exhaustively studied, was also begun in the old Division, as well\r\nas forest surveys, etc.\r\n\r\nBy 1902, enough professional interest was in the country to make the\r\npublication of a professional journal possible and desirable, the\r\n_Forestry Quarterly_ being launched by the writer, with a Board of\r\nEditors chosen mainly from the forest schools.\r\n\r\nThe first association of professional foresters was formed in 1900--the\r\n_Society of American Foresters_--which issues from time to time\r\nproceedings containing technical discussions.\r\n\r\nThe technical book literature, partly due, no doubt, to the overpowering\r\npublication facilities of the federal government, is still scanty, and\r\ngood textbooks especially are still lacking in most branches.\r\n\r\nA series of ephemeral popular books answered the demands of earlier\r\ndays, but outside of Professor _Henry S. Graves’_ volumes on _Forest\r\nMensuration_ and lately on _The Principles of Handling Woodlands_, and a\r\nfew minor aid books and lecture notes, there is as yet nothing of\r\npermanent value to be recorded. The writers’ own publication, _Economics\r\nof Forestry_, is intended less for foresters than students of political\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThree monumental works can be mentioned in the dendrological line,\r\nhowever, namely the 10th volume of the XII Census (1880) on the _Forests\r\nof North America_; Micheaux and Nuttall’s _North American Silva_ in 5\r\nvolumes, 1865; and C. S. Sargent’s _Silva of the United States_, in 14\r\nmagnificent volumes,--three publications which can take rank with any\r\nsimilar literature anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSULAR POSSESSIONS.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish War, in 1898, brought to the United States new outlying\r\nterritory, over 150,000 square miles, in three locations, the\r\nrelationship as regards government varying in the three cases, namely\r\nPorto Rico, the Sandwich Islands, and the Philippine Islands, besides\r\nseveral smaller islands in the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nWhile the latter are only temporarily under control or tutelage of the\r\nUnited States, and are expected sooner or later to attain complete self\r\ngovernment, Hawaii was annexed as a Territory in the same sense as all\r\nother Territories, the inhabitants having become citizens of the United\r\nStates, while Porto Rico is a dependency with partial self-government,\r\nbut its inhabitants do not enjoy citizenship in the States.\r\n\r\nAll these islands are located in the tropics and hence the composition\r\nof the forest is of tropical species.\r\n\r\nCommercially, the forests of Porto Rico and of Hawaii are relatively of\r\nlittle value, but their protective value is paramount, and a\r\nconservative policy is needed in order to preserve the water supply for\r\nagricultural use (sugar plantations in Hawaii) and to prevent erosion.\r\n\r\nFor Porto Rico, a beginning of forest policy was made by setting aside,\r\nin 1903, the Luquillo Forest Reservation, some 20,000 acres in the\r\nEastern mountainous part of the island, which is under direct control of\r\nthe United States government. The rest of public lands and forests was\r\nplaced under the Department of the Interior of the island.\r\n\r\nIn Hawaii, even before annexation, a movement on the part of the Sugar\r\nPlanters Association was made in 1897, to induce the insular government\r\nto devise protective measures. The result was the appointment of a\r\nCommittee who made a report in which the writer had a hand. But not\r\nuntil 1903 was a Board of Commissioners of Agriculture and Forestry\r\nestablished, a Superintendent of Forestry appointed, an organization of\r\ndistrict foresters effected, and a number of forest reservations\r\nestablished. The principle of State forest was fully recognized by\r\nplanning the gradual withdrawal of some 300,000 acres and by beginning\r\nthe extension of forested area by plantations. In 1910, 23 reserves with\r\nan area of 575,000 acres had been made. Distribution of plant material\r\nand of advice to planters is also part of the policy. Annual Reports are\r\nissued which attest the good common sense in the administration.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippine Islands, a territory of 120,000 square miles, largely\r\nmountainous, not only the protective but the commercial value of the\r\ntimberlands is considerable. The extent is variously estimated as\r\ncovering between 40 and 50 million acres (50% of total area), much of it\r\nvirgin, and 16 million acres of it commercially valuable. Of the seven\r\nhundred odd species of trees, mostly heavy woods, composing the forest,\r\nsome 160 are marketable at home and in China; yet almost fifty per cent.\r\nof the home consumption is imported from the States, owing to absence or\r\ninaccessibility of softwoods, and high cost due to excessive expense of\r\npresent logging methods.\r\n\r\nWhen the United States took charge of the islands it was found that the\r\nSpaniards had since 1863 a forestry service, manned by Spanish\r\nforesters, and in the lower ranks by Filipinos. To be sure, the\r\nactivities of this forestry bureau went hardly beyond the collection of\r\ndues for timber licenses, which yielded little more than the cost of the\r\nservice, although on paper excellent instructions were found elaborated.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that an officer of the American army, Captain George P.\r\nAhern, had for some time given attention to forestry matters in the\r\nStates, and he naturally was placed in charge of this bureau, in 1900.\r\nThere were found to be around one million acres private and church\r\nproperty, the rest being considered State lands, but all private owners\r\nwere required to register their holdings before being allowed to\r\nexercise their rights. A system of licenses for cutting timber, and of\r\nfree use permits to the poor population was continued after Spanish\r\nmodels. Not only was an efficient administration gradually secured, but\r\nthe technical side of dendrological and silvicultural knowledge was\r\ndeveloped as rapidly as possible under the able administration of\r\nCaptain Ahern, a continuously growing literature being the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ADMINISTRATION, Austria, 167; Canada, 424; Denmark, 316; Finland, 281;\r\n    France, 217, 219, 223, 224; Germany, 80, 120ff; Great Britain, 375;\r\n    Greece, 332, 333; Hungary, 181; India, 396; Italy, 339; Japan,\r\n    450ff; Norway, 309, 311; Portugal, 362; Roumania, 325, 327; Russia,\r\n    268, 269; Spain, 359; Sweden, 291, 301, 302; Switzerland, 197;\r\n    United States, 485, 486, 488.\r\n  Africa, 439.\r\n  Alabama, 496.\r\n  Albania, 322.\r\n  Algiers, 223, 250.\r\n  Allmende (Germany), 28.\r\n  Allotment methods, 73, 114, 120, 303.\r\n  André, 115.\r\n  Andrews, 474.\r\n  Arabia, 15.\r\n  Arborday, Germany, 63; Italy, 348; Japan, 449; Spain, 360; United\r\n    States, 477.\r\n  Area allotment, Austria, 170; France, 240; Germany, 114; Sweden, 303.\r\n  Area division, France, 240; Germany, 40, 69, 70, 74; Russia, 274.\r\n  Arnold, 272.\r\n  Artaxerxes, regulations by, 10.\r\n  Aschaffenburg, 146.\r\n  Asia Minor, 10.\r\n  Associations, Austria, 176; Canada, 435; Denmark, 319; Finland, 284;\r\n    France, 247; Germany, 148; Great Britain, 378; Greece, 334; Hungary,\r\n    184; Italy, 349; Japan, 454; Norway, 314; Roumania, 326; Russia,\r\n    271, 272; Sweden, 305; Switzerland, 201; United States, 479, 480,\r\n    481, 503.\r\n  Australia, 440.\r\n  Austria, 152.\r\n\r\n  BADEN, 120.\r\n  Baden-Powell, 390, 408.\r\n  Bagneris, 242, 246.\r\n  Balestrieri, 347.\r\n  Ball planting, Germany, 65.\r\n  Banforest, Austria, 163; Germany, 21; Great Britain, 370; Italy, 343,\r\n    344, 346; Japan, 448; Russia, 261; Switzerland, 190.\r\n  Barres, 244.\r\n  Baudrillart, 242, 245.\r\n  Baur, 133, 137, 138, 140, 147.\r\n  Bavaria, 119.\r\n  Bechstein, J.
