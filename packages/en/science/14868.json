He measured the\r\nsilk, and turned it round and round, and trimmed it into shape with his\r\nshears; the table was all littered with cherry-coloured snippets.\r\n\r\n\"No breadth at all, and cut on the cross; it is no breadth at all; tippets\r\nfor mice and ribbons for mobs! for mice!\" said the Tailor of Gloucester.\r\n\r\nWhen the snow-flakes came down against the small leaded window-panes and\r\nshut out the light, the tailor had done his day's work; all the silk and\r\nsatin lay cut out upon the table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere were twelve pieces for the coat and four pieces for the waistcoat;\r\nand there were pocket flaps and cuffs, and buttons all in order. For the\r\nlining of the coat there was fine yellow taffeta; and for the button-holes\r\nof the waistcoat, there was cherry-coloured twist. And everything was\r\nready to sew together in the morning, all measured and sufficient--except\r\nthat there was wanting just one single skein of cherry-coloured twisted\r\nsilk.\r\n\r\nThe tailor came out of his shop at dark, for he did not sleep there at\r\nnights; he fastened the window and locked the door, and took away the key.\r\nNo one lived there at night but little brown mice, and they run in and out\r\nwithout any keys!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor behind the wooden wainscots of all the old houses in Gloucester, there\r\nare little mouse staircases and secret trap-doors; and the mice run from\r\nhouse to house through those long narrow passages; they can run all over\r\nthe town without going into the streets.\r\n\r\nBut the tailor came out of his shop, and shuffled home through the snow.\r\nHe lived quite near by in College Court, next the doorway to College\r\nGreen; and although it was not a big house, the tailor was so poor he only\r\nrented the kitchen.\r\n\r\nHe lived alone with his cat; it was called Simpkin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow all day long while the tailor was out at work, Simpkin kept house by\r\nhimself; and he also was fond of the mice, though he gave them no satin\r\nfor coats!\r\n\r\n\"Miaw?\" said the cat when the tailor opened the door. \"Miaw?\"\r\n\r\nThe tailor replied--\"Simpkin, we shall make our fortune, but I am worn to\r\na ravelling. Take this groat (which is our last fourpence) and Simpkin,\r\ntake a china pipkin; buy a penn'orth of bread, a penn'orth of milk and a\r\npenn'orth of sausages. And oh, Simpkin, with the last penny of our\r\nfourpence buy me one penn'orth of cherry-coloured silk. But do not lose\r\nthe last penny of the fourpence, Simpkin, or I am undone and worn to a\r\nthread-paper, for I have NO MORE TWIST.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen Simpkin again said, \"Miaw?\" and took the groat and the pipkin, and\r\nwent out into the dark.\r\n\r\nThe tailor was very tired and beginning to be ill. He sat down by the\r\nhearth and talked to himself about that wonderful coat.\r\n\r\n\"I shall make my fortune--to be cut bias--the Mayor of Gloucester is to be\r\nmarried on Christmas Day in the morning, and he hath ordered a coat and an\r\nembroidered waistcoat--to be lined with yellow taffeta--and the taffeta\r\nsufficeth; there is no more left over in snippets than will serve to make\r\ntippets for mice----\"\r\n\r\nThen the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser\r\nat the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises--\r\n\r\n_Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!_\r\n\r\n\"Now what can that be?\" said the Tailor of Gloucester, jumping up from his\r\nchair. The dresser was covered with crockery and pipkins, willow pattern\r\nplates, and tea-cups and mugs.\r\n\r\nThe tailor crossed the kitchen, and stood quite still beside the dresser,\r\nlistening, and peering through his spectacles. Again from under a tea-cup,\r\ncame those funny little noises--\r\n\r\n_Tip tap, tip tap, Tip tap tip!_\r\n\r\n\"This is very peculiar,\" said the Tailor of Gloucester; and he lifted up\r\nthe tea-cup which was upside down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOut stepped a little live lady mouse, and made a curtsey to the tailor!\r\nThen she hopped away down off the dresser, and under the wainscot.\r\n\r\nThe tailor sat down again by the fire, warming his poor cold hands, and\r\nmumbling to himself----\r\n\r\n\"The waistcoat is cut out from peach-coloured satin--tambour stitch and\r\nrose-buds in beautiful floss silk. Was I wise to entrust my last fourpence\r\nto Simpkin? One-and-twenty button-holes of cherry-coloured twist!\"\r\n\r\nBut all at once, from the dresser, there came other little noises:\r\n\r\n_Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!_\r\n\r\n\"This is passing extraordinary!\" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and\r\nturned over another tea-cup, which was upside down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOut stepped a little gentleman mouse, and made a bow to the tailor!\r\n\r\nAnd then from all over the dresser came a chorus of little tappings, all\r\nsounding together, and answering one another, like watch-beetles in an old\r\nworm-eaten window-shutter--\r\n\r\n_Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip_!\r\n\r\nAnd out from under tea-cups and from under bowls and basins, stepped other\r\nand more little mice who hopped away down off the dresser and under the\r\nwainscot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe tailor sat down, close over the fire, lamenting--\"One-and-twenty\r\nbutton-holes of cherry-coloured silk! To be finished by noon of\r\nSaturday: and this is Tuesday evening. Was it right to let loose those\r\nmice, undoubtedly the property of Simpkin? Alack, I am undone, for I have\r\nno more twist!\"\r\n\r\nThe little mice came out again, and listened to the tailor; they took\r\nnotice of the pattern of that wonderful coat. They whispered to one\r\nanother about the taffeta lining, and about little mouse tippets.\r\n\r\nAnd then all at once they all ran away together down the passage behind\r\nthe wainscot, squeaking and calling to one another, as they ran from house\r\nto house; and not one mouse was left in the tailor's kitchen when Simpkin\r\ncame back with the pipkin of milk!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSimpkin opened the door and bounced in, with an angry \"G-r-r-miaw!\" like a\r\ncat that is vexed: for he hated the snow, and there was snow in his ears,\r\nand snow in his collar at the back of his neck. He put down the loaf and\r\nthe sausages upon the dresser, and sniffed.\r\n\r\n\"Simpkin,\" said the tailor, \"where is my twist?\"\r\n\r\nBut Simpkin set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser, and looked\r\nsuspiciously at the tea-cups. He wanted his supper of little fat mouse!\r\n\r\n\"Simpkin,\" said the tailor, \"where is my TWIST?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and\r\ngrowled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have\r\nasked: \"Where is my MOUSE?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alack, I am undone!\" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nAll that night long Simpkin hunted and searched through the kitchen,\r\npeeping into cupboards and under the wainscot, and into the tea-pot where\r\nhe had hidden that twist; but still he found never a mouse!\r\n\r\nWhenever the tailor muttered and talked in his sleep, Simpkin said\r\n\"Miaw-ger-r-w-s-s-ch!\" and made strange horrid noises, as cats do at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor the poor old tailor was very ill with a fever, tossing and turning in\r\nhis four-post bed; and still in his dreams he mumbled--\"No more twist! no\r\nmore twist!\"\r\n\r\nAll that day he was ill, and the next day, and the next; and what should\r\nbecome of the cherry-coloured coat? In the tailor's shop in Westgate\r\nStreet the embroidered silk and satin lay cut out upon the\r\ntable--one-and-twenty button-holes--and who should come to sew them, when\r\nthe window was barred, and the door was fast locked?\r\n\r\nBut that does not hinder the little brown mice; they run in and out\r\nwithout any keys through all the old houses in Gloucester!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOut of doors the market folks went trudging through the snow to buy their\r\ngeese and turkeys, and to bake their Christmas pies; but there would be no\r\nChristmas dinner for Simpkin and the poor old Tailor of Gloucester.\r\n\r\nThe tailor lay ill for three days and nights; and then it was Christmas\r\nEve, and very late at night. The moon climbed up over the roofs and\r\nchimneys, and looked down over the gateway into College Court. There were\r\nno lights in the windows, nor any sound in the houses; all the city of\r\nGloucester was fast asleep under the snow.\r\n\r\nAnd still Simpkin wanted his mice, and he mewed as he stood beside the\r\nfour-post bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut it is in the old story that all the beasts can talk, in the night\r\nbetween Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in the morning (though there are\r\nvery few folk that can hear them, or know what it is that they say).\r\n\r\nWhen the Cathedral clock struck twelve there was an answer--like an echo\r\nof the chimes--and Simpkin heard it, and came out of the tailor's door,\r\nand wandered about in the snow.\r\n\r\nFrom all the roofs and gables and old wooden houses in Gloucester came a\r\nthousand merry voices singing the old Christmas rhymes--all the old songs\r\nthat ever I heard of, and some that I don't know, like Whittington's\r\nbells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFirst and loudest the cocks cried out: \"Dame, get up, and bake your pies!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dilly, dilly, dilly!\" sighed Simpkin.\r\n\r\nAnd now in a garret there were lights and sounds of dancing, and cats came\r\nfrom over the way.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle! All the cats in\r\nGloucester--except me,\" said Simpkin.\r\n\r\nUnder the wooden eaves the starlings and sparrows sang of Christmas pies;\r\nthe jack-daws woke up in the Cathedral tower; and although it was the\r\nmiddle of the night the throstles and robins sang; the air was quite full\r\nof little twittering tunes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut it was all rather provoking to poor hungry Simpkin!\r\n\r\nParticularly he was vexed with some little shrill voices from behind a\r\nwooden lattice. I think that they were bats, because they always have very\r\nsmall voices--especially in a black frost, when they talk in their sleep,\r\nlike the Tailor of Gloucester.\r\n\r\nThey said something mysterious that sounded like--\r\n\r\n    \"Buz, quoth the blue fly, hum, quoth the bee,\r\n     Buz and hum they cry, and so do we!\"\r\n\r\nand Simpkin went away shaking his ears as if he had a bee in his bonnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrom the tailor's shop in Westgate came a glow of light; and when Simpkin\r\ncrept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles. There was a\r\nsnippeting of scissors, and snappeting of thread; and little mouse voices\r\nsang loudly and gaily--\r\n\r\n            \"Four-and-twenty tailors\r\n             Went to catch a snail,\r\n             The best man amongst them\r\n             Durst not touch her tail,\r\n             She put out her horns\r\n             Like a little kyloe cow,\r\n    Run, tailors, run! or she'll have you all e'en now!\"\r\n\r\nThen without a pause the little mouse voices went on again--\r\n\r\n    \"Sieve my lady's oatmeal,\r\n     Grind my lady's flour,\r\n     Put it in a chestnut,\r\n     Let it stand an hour----\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Mew! Mew!\" interrupted Simpkin, and he scratched at the door. But the\r\nkey was under the tailor's pillow, he could not get in.\r\n\r\nThe little mice only laughed, and tried another tune--\r\n\r\n    \"Three little mice sat down to spin,\r\n     Pussy passed by and she peeped in.\r\n     What are you at, my fine little men?\r\n     Making coats for gentlemen.\r\n     Shall I come in and cut off your threads?\r\n     Oh, no, Miss Pussy, you'd bite off our heads!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mew! Mew!\" cried Simpkin. \"Hey diddle dinketty?\" answered the little\r\nmice--\r\n\r\n    \"Hey diddle dinketty, poppetty pet!\r\n     The merchants of London they wear scarlet;\r\n     Silk in the collar, and gold in the hem,\r\n     So merrily march the merchantmen!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey clicked their thimbles to mark the time, but none of the songs\r\npleased Simpkin; he sniffed and mewed at the door of the shop.\r\n\r\n    \"And then I bought\r\n     A pipkin and a popkin,\r\n     A slipkin and a slopkin,\r\n     All for one farthing----\r\n\r\nand upon the kitchen dresser!\" added the rude little mice.\r\n\r\n\"Mew! scratch! scratch!\" scuffled Simpkin on the window-sill; while the\r\nlittle mice inside sprang to their feet, and all began to shout at once in\r\nlittle twittering voices: \"No more twist! No more twist!\" And they barred\r\nup the window shutters and shut out Simpkin.\r\n\r\nBut still through the nicks in the shutters he could hear the click of\r\nthimbles, and little mouse voices singing--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"No more twist! No more twist!\"\r\n\r\nSimpkin came away from the shop and went home, considering in his mind. He\r\nfound the poor old tailor without fever, sleeping peacefully.\r\n\r\nThen Simpkin went on tip-toe and took a little parcel of silk out of the\r\ntea-pot, and looked at it in the moonlight; and he felt quite ashamed of\r\nhis badness compared with those good little mice!\r\n\r\nWhen the tailor awoke in the morning, the first thing which he saw upon\r\nthe patchwork quilt, was a skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk, and\r\nbeside his bed stood the repentant Simpkin!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Alack, I am worn to a ravelling,\" said the Tailor of Gloucester, \"but I\r\nhave my twist!\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and\r\ncame out into the street with Simpkin running before him.\r\n\r\nThe starlings whistled on the chimney stacks, and the throstles and robins\r\nsang--but they sang their own little noises, not the words they had sung\r\nin the night.\r\n\r\n\"Alack,\" said the tailor, \"I have my twist; but no more strength--nor\r\ntime--than will serve to make me one single button-hole; for this is\r\nChristmas Day in the Morning! The Mayor of Gloucester shall be married by\r\nnoon--and where is his cherry-coloured coat?\"\r\n\r\nHe unlocked the door of the little shop in Westgate Street, and Simpkin\r\nran in, like a cat that expects something.\r\n\r\nBut there was no one there! Not even one little brown mouse!\r\n\r\nThe boards were swept clean; the little ends of thread and the little silk\r\nsnippets were all tidied away, and gone from off the floor.\r\n\r\nBut upon the table--oh joy! the tailor gave a shout--there, where he had\r\nleft plain cuttings of silk--there lay the most beautifullest coat and\r\nembroidered satin waistcoat that ever were worn by a Mayor of Gloucester.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere were roses and pansies upon the facings of the coat; and the\r\nwaistcoat was worked with poppies and corn-flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEverything was finished except just one single cherry-coloured\r\nbutton-hole, and where that button-hole was wanting there was pinned a\r\nscrap of paper with these words--in little teeny weeny writing--\r\n\r\n              NO MORE TWIST\r\n\r\nAnd from then began the luck of the Tailor of Gloucester; he grew quite\r\nstout, and he grew quite rich.\r\n\r\nHe made the most wonderful waistcoats for all the rich merchants of\r\nGloucester, and for all the fine gentlemen of the country round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNever were seen such ruffles, or such embroidered cuffs and lappets! But\r\nhis button-holes were the greatest triumph of it all.\r\n\r\nThe stitches of those button-holes were so neat--_so_ neat--I wonder how\r\nthey could be stitched by an old man in spectacles, with crooked old\r\nfingers, and a tailor's thimble.\r\n\r\nThe stitches of those button-holes were so small--_so_ small--they looked\r\nas if they had been made by little mice!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Tailor of Gloucester, by Beatrix Potter",
