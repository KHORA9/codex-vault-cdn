THE SLAYER OF SOULS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLAYER OF SOULS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nTHE YEZIDEE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly when the _Nan-yang Maru_ sailed from Yuen-San did her terrible\r\nsense of foreboding begin to subside.\r\n\r\nFor four years, waking or sleeping, the awful subconsciousness of\r\nsupreme evil had never left her.\r\n\r\nBut now, as the Korean shore, receding into darkness, grew dimmer and\r\ndimmer, fear subsided and grew vague as the half-forgotten memory of\r\nhorror in a dream.\r\n\r\nShe stood near the steamer’s stern apart from other passengers, a\r\nslender, lonely figure in her silver-fox furs, her ulster and smart\r\nlittle hat, watching the lights of Yuen-San grow paler and smaller\r\nalong the horizon until they looked like a level row of stars.\r\n\r\nUnder her haunted eyes Asia was slowly dissolving to a streak of vapour\r\nin the misty lustre of the moon.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the ancient continent disappeared, washed out by a wave\r\nagainst the sky; and with it vanished the last shreds of that accursed\r\nnightmare which had possessed her for four endless years. But whether\r\nduring those unreal years her soul had only been held in bondage, or\r\nwhether, as she had been taught, it had been irrevocably destroyed, she\r\nstill remained uncertain, knowing nothing about the death of souls or\r\nhow it was accomplished.\r\n\r\nAs she stood there, her sad eyes fixed on the misty East, a passenger\r\npassing—an Englishwoman—paused to say something kind to the young\r\nAmerican; and added, “if there is anything my husband and I can do it\r\nwould give us much pleasure.” The girl had turned her head as though\r\nnot comprehending. The other woman hesitated.\r\n\r\n“This is Doctor Norne’s daughter, is it not?” she inquired in a\r\npleasant voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am Tressa Norne.... I ask your pardon.... Thank you, madam:—I\r\nam—I seem to be—a trifle dazed——”\r\n\r\n“What wonder, you poor child! Come to us if you feel need of\r\ncompanionship.”\r\n\r\n“You are very kind.... I seem to wish to be alone, somehow.”\r\n\r\n“I understand.... Good-night, my dear.”\r\n\r\nLate the next morning Tressa Norne awoke, conscious for the first time\r\nin four years that it was at last her own familiar self stretched out\r\nthere on the pillows where sunshine streamed through the porthole. All\r\nthat day she lay in her bamboo steamer chair on deck. Sun and wind\r\nconspired to dry every tear that wet her closed lashes. Her dark,\r\nglossy hair blew about her face; scarlet tinted her full lips again;\r\nthe tense hands relaxed. Peace came at sundown.\r\n\r\nThat evening she took her Yu-kin from her cabin and found a chair on\r\nthe deserted hurricane deck.\r\n\r\nAnd here, in the brilliant moonlight of the China Sea, she curled up\r\ncross-legged on the deck, all alone, and sounded the four futile\r\nstrings of her moon-lute, and hummed to herself, in a still voice, old\r\nsongs she had sung in Yian before the tragedy. She sang the tent-song\r\ncalled _Tchinguiz_. She sang _Camel Bells_ and _The Blue\r\nBazaar_,—children’s songs of the Yiort. She sang the ancient Khiounnou\r\nsong called “The Saghalien”:\r\n\r\n_I_\r\n\r\n_In the month of Saffar_\r\n_Among the river-reeds_\r\n_I saw two horsemen_\r\n_Sitting on their steeds._\r\n_Tulugum!_\r\n_Heitulum!_\r\n_By the river-reeds_\r\n\r\n\r\n_II_\r\n\r\n_In the month of Saffar_\r\n_A demon guards the ford._\r\n_Tokhta, my Lover!_\r\n_Draw your shining sword!_\r\n_Tulugum!_\r\n_Heitulum!_\r\n_Slay him with your sword!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_III_\r\n\r\n_In the month of Saffar_\r\n_Among the water-weeds_\r\n_I saw two horsemen_\r\n_Fighting on their steeds._\r\n_Tulugum!_\r\n_Heitulum!_\r\n_How my lover bleeds!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV_\r\n\r\n_In the month of Saffar,_\r\n_The Year I should have wed—_\r\n_The Year of The Panther—_\r\n_My lover lay dead,—_\r\n_Tulugum!_\r\n_Heitulum!_\r\n_Dead without a head._\r\n\r\nAnd songs like these—the one called “Keuke Mongol,” and an ancient air\r\nof the Tchortchas called “The Thirty Thousand Calamities,” and some\r\nChinese boatmen’s songs which she had heard in Yian before the tragedy;\r\nthese she hummed to herself there in the moonlight playing on her\r\nround-faced, short-necked lute of four strings.\r\n\r\nTerror indeed seemed ended for her, and in her heart a great\r\noverwhelming joy was welling up which seemed to overflow across the\r\nentire moonlit world.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had no longer any fear; no premonition of further evil. Among the\r\nfew Americans and English aboard, something of her story was already\r\nknown. People were kind; and they were also considerate enough to\r\nsubdue their sympathetic curiosity when they discovered that this young\r\nAmerican girl shrank from any mention of what had happened to her\r\nduring the last four years of the Great World War.\r\n\r\nIt was evident, also, that she preferred to remain aloof; and this\r\ninclination, when finally understood, was respected by her fellow\r\npassengers. The clever, efficient and polite Japanese officers and crew\r\nof the _Nan-yang Maru_ were invariably considerate and courteous to\r\nher, and they remained nicely reticent, although they also knew the\r\nmain outline of her story and very much desired to know more. And so,\r\nsurrounded now by the friendly security of civilised humanity, Tressa\r\nNorne, reborn to light out of hell’s own shadows, awoke from four years\r\nof nightmare which, after all, perhaps, never had seemed entirely\r\nactual.\r\n\r\nAnd now God’s real sun warmed her by day; His real moon bathed her in\r\ncreamy coolness by night; sky and wind and wave thrilled her with their\r\nblessed assurance that this was once more the real world which\r\nstretched illimitably on every side from horizon to horizon; and the\r\nfair faces and pleasant voices of her own countrymen made the past seem\r\nonly a ghastly dream that never again could enmesh her soul with its\r\nweb of sorcery.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now the days at sea fled very swiftly; and when at last the Golden\r\nGate was not far away she had finally managed to persuade herself that\r\nnothing really can harm the human soul; that the monstrous devil-years\r\nwere ended, never again to return; that in this vast, clean Western\r\nContinent there could be no occult threat to dread, no gigantic menace\r\nto destroy her body, no secret power that could consign her soul to the\r\ndreadful abysm of spiritual annihilation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery early that morning she came on deck. The November day was\r\ndelightfully warm, the air clear save for a belt of mist low on the\r\nwater to the southward.\r\n\r\nShe had been told that land would not be sighted for twenty-four hours,\r\nbut she went forward and stood beside the starboard rail, searching the\r\nhorizon with the enchanted eyes of hope.\r\n\r\nAs she stood there a Japanese ship’s officer crossing the deck,\r\nforward, halted abruptly and stood staring at something to the\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, above the belt of mist on the water, and perfectly\r\nclear against the blue sky above, the girl saw a fountain of gold fire\r\nrise from the fog, drift upward in the daylight, slowly assume the\r\nincandescent outline of a serpentine creature which leisurely uncoiled\r\nand hung there floating, its lizard-tail undulating, its feet with\r\ntheir five stumpy claws closing, relaxing, like those of a living\r\nreptile. For a full minute this amazing shape of fire floated there in\r\nthe sky, brilliant in the morning light, then the reptilian form faded,\r\ndied out, and the last spark vanished in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nWhen the Japanese officer at last turned to resume his promenade, he\r\nnoticed a white-faced girl gripping a stanchion behind him as though\r\nshe were on the point of swooning. He crossed the deck quickly. Tressa\r\nNorne’s eyes opened.\r\n\r\n“Are you ill, Miss Norne?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“The—the Dragon,” she whispered.\r\n\r\nThe officer laughed. “Why, that was nothing but Chinese day-fireworks,”\r\nhe explained. “The crew of some fishing boat yonder in the fog is\r\namusing itself.” He looked at her narrowly, then with a nice little bow\r\nand smile he offered his arm: “If you are indisposed, perhaps you might\r\nwish to go below to your stateroom, Miss Norne?”\r\n\r\nShe thanked him, managed to pull herself together and force a ghost of\r\na smile.\r\n\r\nHe lingered a moment, said something cheerful about being nearly home,\r\nthen made her a punctilious salute and went his way.\r\n\r\nTressa Norne leaned back against the stanchion and closed her eyes. Her\r\npallor became deathly. She bent over and laid her white face in her\r\nfolded arms.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she lifted her head, and, turning very slowly, stared at\r\nthe fog-belt out of frightened eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd saw, rising out of the fog, a pearl-tinted sphere which gradually\r\nmounted into the clear daylight above like the full moon’s phantom in\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nHigher, higher rose the spectral moon until at last it swam in the very\r\nzenith. Then it slowly evaporated in the blue vault above.\r\n\r\nA great wave of despair swept her; she clung to the stanchion, staring\r\nwith half-blinded eyes at the flat fog-bank in the south.\r\n\r\nBut no more “Chinese day-fireworks” rose out of it. And at length she\r\nsummoned sufficient strength to go below to her cabin and lie there,\r\nhalf senseless, huddled on her bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen land was sighted, the following morning, Tressa Norne had lived a\r\ncentury in twenty-four hours. And in that space of time her agonised\r\nsoul had touched all depths.\r\n\r\nBut now as the Golden Gate loomed up in the morning light, rage,\r\nterror, despair had burned themselves out. From their ashes within her\r\nmind arose the cool wrath of desperation armed for anything, wary,\r\nalert, passionately determined to survive at whatever cost, recklessly\r\nready to fight for bodily existence.\r\n\r\nThat was her sole instinct now, to go on living, to survive, no matter\r\nat what price. And if it were indeed true that her soul had been slain,\r\nshe defied its murderers to slay her body also.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night, at her hotel in San Francisco, she double-locked her door\r\nand lay down without undressing, leaving all lights burning and an\r\nautomatic pistol underneath her pillow.\r\n\r\nToward morning she fell asleep, slept for an hour, started up in awful\r\nfear. And saw the double-locked door opposite the foot of her bed\r\nslowly opening of its own accord.\r\n\r\nInto the brightly illuminated room stepped a graceful young man in full\r\nevening dress carrying over his left arm an overcoat, and in his other\r\nhand a top hat and silver tipped walking-stick.\r\n\r\nWith one bound the girl swung herself from the bed to the carpet and\r\nclutched at the pistol under her pillow.\r\n\r\n“Sanang!” she cried in a terrible voice.\r\n\r\n“Keuke Mongol!” he said, smilingly.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they confronted each other in the brightly lighted\r\nbedroom, then, partly turning, he cast a calm glance at the open door\r\nbehind him; and, as though moved by a wind, the door slowly closed. And\r\nshe heard the key turn of itself in the lock, and saw the bolt slide\r\nsmoothly into place again.\r\n\r\nHer power of speech came back to her presently—only a broken whisper at\r\nfirst: “Do you think I am afraid of your accursed magic?” she managed\r\nto gasp. “Do you think I am afraid of you, Sanang?”\r\n\r\n“You are afraid,” he said serenely.\r\n\r\n“You lie!”\r\n\r\n“No, I do not lie. To one another the Yezidees never lie.”\r\n\r\n“You lie again, assassin! I am no Yezidee!”\r\n\r\nHe smiled gently. His features were pleasing, smooth, and regular; his\r\ncheek-bones high, his skin fine and of a pale and delicate ivory\r\ncolour. Once his black, beautifully shaped eyes wandered to the\r\nlevelled pistol which she now held clutched desperately close to her\r\nright hip, and a slightly ironical expression veiled his gaze for an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n“Bullets?” he murmured. “But you and I are of the Hassanis.”\r\n\r\n“The third lie, Sanang!” Her voice had regained its strength. Tense,\r\nalert, blue eyes ablaze, every faculty concentrated on the terrible\r\nbusiness before her, the girl now seemed like some supple leopardess\r\npoised on the swift verge of murder.\r\n\r\n“Tokhta!”[1] She spat the word. “Any movement toward a hidden weapon,\r\nany gesture suggesting recourse to magic—and I kill you, Sanang,\r\nexactly where you stand!”\r\n\r\n“With a pistol?” He laughed. Then his smooth features altered subtly.\r\nHe said: “Keuke Mongol, who call yourself Tressa Norne,—Keuke—heavenly\r\nazure-blue,—named so in the temple because of the colour of your\r\neyes—listen attentively, for this is the Yarlig which I bring to you by\r\nword of mouth from Yian, as from Yezidee to Yezidee:\r\n\r\n“Here, in this land called the United States of America, the Temple\r\ngirl, Keuke Mongol, who has witnessed the mysteries of Erlik and who\r\nunderstands the magic of the Sheiks-el-Djebel, and who has seen Mount\r\nAlamout and the eight castles and the fifty thousand Hassanis in white\r\nturbans and in robes of white;—_you_—Azure-blue eyes—heed the\r\nYarlig!—or may thirty thousand calamities overtake you!”\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence; then he went on seriously: “It is decreed:\r\nYou shall cease to remember that you are a Yezidee, that you are of the\r\nHassanis, that you ever have laid eyes on Yian the Beautiful, that you\r\never set naked foot upon Mount Alamout. It is decreed that you remember\r\nnothing of what you have seen and heard, of what has been told and\r\ntaught during the last four years reckoned as the Christians reckon\r\nfrom our Year of the Bull. Otherwise—my Master sends you this for\r\nyour—_convenience_.”\r\n\r\nLeisurely, from under his folded overcoat, the young man produced a\r\nroll of white cloth and dropped it at her feet and the girl shrank\r\naside, shuddering, knowing that the roll of white cloth was meant for\r\nher winding-sheet.\r\n\r\nThen the colour came back to lip and cheek; and, glancing up from the\r\nsoft white shroud, she smiled at the young man: “Have you ended your\r\nOriental mummery?” she asked calmly. “Listen very seriously in your\r\nturn, Sanang, Sheik-el-Djebel, Prince of the Hassanis who, God knows\r\nwhen and how, have come out into the sunshine of this clean and decent\r\ncountry, out of a filthy darkness where devils and sorcerers make earth\r\na hell.\r\n\r\n“If you, or yours, threaten me, annoy me, interfere with me, I shall go\r\nto our civilised police and tell all I know concerning the Yezidees. I\r\nmean to live. Do you understand? You know what you have done to me and\r\nmine. I come back to my own country alone, without any living kin,\r\npoor, homeless, friendless,—and, perhaps, damned. I intend,\r\nnevertheless, to survive. I shall not relax my clutch on bodily\r\nexistence whatever the Yezidees may pretend to have done to my soul. I\r\nam determined to live in the body, anyway.”\r\n\r\nHe nodded gravely.\r\n\r\nShe said: “Out at sea, over the fog, I saw the sign of Yu-lao in fire\r\nfloating in the day-sky. I saw his spectral moon rise and vanish in\r\nmid-heaven. I understood. But——” And here she suddenly showed an edge\r\nof teeth under the full scarlet upper lip: “Keep your signs and your\r\nshrouds to yourself, dog of a Yezidee!—toad!—tortoise-egg!—he-goat with\r\nthree legs! Keep your threats and your messages to yourself! Keep your\r\naccursed magic to yourself! Do you think to frighten me with your\r\nsorcery by showing me the Moons of Yu-lao?—by opening a bolted door? I\r\nknow more of such magic than do you, Sanang—Death Adder of Alamout!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly she laughed aloud at him—laughed insultingly in his\r\nexpressionless face:\r\n\r\n“I saw you and Gutchlug Khan and your cowardly Tchortchas in\r\nred-lacquered jackets slink out of the Temple of Erlik where the bronze\r\ngong thundered and a cloud settled down raining little yellow snakes\r\nall over the marble steps—all over you, Prince Sanang! You were\r\n_afraid_, my Tougtchi!—you and Gutchlug and your red Tchortchas with\r\ntheir halberds all dripping with human entrails! And I saw you mount\r\nand gallop off into the woods while in the depths of the magic cloud\r\nwhich rained little yellow snakes all around you, we temple girls\r\nlaughed and mocked at you—at you and your cowardly Tchortcha horsemen.”\r\n\r\nA slight tinge of pink came into the young man’s pale face. Tressa\r\nNorne stepped nearer, her levelled pistol resting on her hip.\r\n\r\n“Why did you not complain of us to your Master, the Old Man of the\r\nMountain?” she asked jeeringly. “And where, also, was your Yezidee\r\nmagic when it rained little snakes?—What frightened you away—who had\r\nboldly come to seize a temple girl—you who had screwed up your courage\r\nsufficiently to defy Erlik in his very shrine and snatch from his\r\ntemple a young thing whose naked body wrapped in gold was worth the\r\nchance of death to you?”\r\n\r\nThe young man’s top-hat dropped to the floor. He bent over to pick it\r\nup. His face was quite expressionless, quite colourless, now.\r\n\r\n“I went on no such errand,” he said with an effort. “I went with a\r\nthousand prayers on scarlet paper made in——”\r\n\r\n“A lie, Yezidee! You came to seize _me_!”\r\n\r\nHe turned still paler. “By Abu, Omar, Otman, and Ali, it is not true!”\r\n\r\n“You lie!—by the Lion of God, Hassini!”\r\n\r\nShe stepped closer. “And I’ll tell you another thing you fear—you\r\nYezidee of Alamout—you robber of Yian—you sorcerer of Sabbah Khan, and\r\nchief of his sect of Assassins! You fear this native land of mine,\r\nAmerica; and its laws and customs, and its clear, clean sunshine; and\r\nits cities and people; and its police! Take that message back. We\r\nAmericans fear nobody save the true God!—nobody—neither Yezidee nor\r\nHassani nor Russ nor German nor that sexless monster born of hell and\r\ncalled the Bolshevik!”\r\n\r\n“Tokhta!” he cried sharply.\r\n\r\n“Damn you!” retorted the girl; “get out of my room! Get out of my\r\nsight! Get out of my path! Get out of my life! Take that to your Master\r\nof Mount Alamout! I do what I please; I go where I please; I live as I\r\nplease. And if I please, _I turn against him_!”\r\n\r\n“In that event,” he said hoarsely, “there lies your winding-sheet on\r\nthe floor at your feet! Take up your shroud; and make Erlik seize you!”\r\n\r\n“Sanang,” she said very seriously.\r\n\r\n“I hear you, Keuke-Mongol.”\r\n\r\n“Listen attentively. I wish to live. I have had enough of death in\r\nlife. I desire to remain a living, breathing thing—even if it be\r\ntrue—as you Yezidees tell me, that you have caught my soul in a net and\r\nthat your sorcerers really control its destiny.\r\n\r\n“But damned or not, I passionately desire to live. And I am coward\r\nenough to hold my peace for the sake of living. So—I remain silent. I\r\nhave no stomach to defy the Yezidees; because, if I do, sooner or later\r\nI shall be killed. I know it. I have no desire to die for others—to\r\nperish for the sake of the common good. I am young. I have suffered too\r\nmuch; I am determined to live—and let my soul take its chances between\r\nGod and Erlik.”\r\n\r\nShe came close to him, looked curiously into his pale face.\r\n\r\n“I laughed at you out of the temple cloud,” she said. “I know how to\r\nopen bolted doors as well as you do. And I know _other things_. And if\r\nyou ever again come to me in this life I shall first torture you, then\r\nslay you. Then I shall tell all!... and unroll my shroud.”\r\n\r\n“I keep your word of promise until you break it,” he interrupted\r\nhastily. “Yarlig! It is decreed!” And then he slowly turned as though\r\nto glance over his shoulder at the locked and bolted door.\r\n\r\n“Permit me to open it for you, Prince Sanang,” said the girl\r\nscornfully. And she gazed steadily at the door.\r\n\r\nPresently, all by itself, the key turned in the lock, the bolt slid\r\nback, the door gently opened.\r\n\r\nToward it, white as a corpse, his overcoat on his left arm, his stick\r\nand top-hat in the other hand, crept the young man in his faultless\r\nevening garb.\r\n\r\nThen, as he reached the threshold, he suddenly sprang aside. A small\r\nyellow snake lay coiled there on the door sill. For a full throbbing\r\nminute the young man stared at the yellow reptile in unfeigned horror.\r\nThen, very cautiously, he moved his fascinated eyes sideways and gazed\r\nin silence at Tressa Norne.\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed.\r\n\r\n“Sorceress!” he burst out hoarsely. “Take that accursed thing from my\r\npath!”\r\n\r\n“What thing, Sanang?” At that his dark, frightened eyes stole toward\r\nthe threshold again, seeking the little snake. But there was no snake\r\nthere. And when he was certain of this he went, twitching and trembling\r\nall over.\r\n\r\nBehind him the door closed softly, locking and bolting itself.\r\n\r\nAnd behind the bolted door in the brightly lighted bedroom Tressa Norne\r\nfell on both knees, her pistol still clutched in her right hand,\r\ncalling passionately upon Christ to forgive her for the dreadful\r\nability she had dared to use, and begging Him to save her body from\r\ndeath and her soul from the snare of the Yezidee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTHE YELLOW SNAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the young man named Sanang left the bed-chamber of Tressa Norne he\r\nturned to the right in the carpeted corridor outside and hurried toward\r\nthe hotel elevator. But he did not ring for the lift; instead he took\r\nthe spiral iron stairway which circled it, and mounted hastily to the\r\nfloor above.\r\n\r\nHere was his own apartment and he entered it with a key bearing the\r\nhotel tag. A dusky-skinned powerful old man wearing a grizzled beard\r\nand a greasy broadcloth coat of old-fashioned cut known to provincials\r\nas a “Prince Albert” looked up from where he was seated cross-legged\r\nupon the sofa, sharpening a curved knife on a whetstone.\r\n\r\n“Gutchlug,” stammered Sanang, “I am afraid of her! What happened two\r\nyears ago at the temple happened again a moment since, there in her\r\nvery bedroom! She made a yellow death-adder out of nothing and placed\r\nit upon the threshold, and mocked me with laughter. May Thirty Thousand\r\nCalamities overtake her! May Erlik seize her! May her eyes rot out and\r\nher limbs fester! May the seven score and three principal devils——”\r\n\r\n“You chatter like a temple ape,” said Gutchlug tranquilly. “Does Keuke\r\nMongol die or live? That alone interests me.”\r\n\r\n“Gutchlug,” faltered the young man, “thou knowest that m-my heart is\r\ninclined to mercy toward this young Yezidee——”\r\n\r\n“I know that it is inclined to lust,” said the other bluntly.\r\n\r\nSanang’s pale face flamed.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” he said. “If I had not loved her better than life had I dared\r\ngo that day to the temple to take her for my own?”\r\n\r\n“You loved life better,” said Gutchlug. “You fled when it rained snakes\r\non the temple steps—you and your Tchortcha horsemen! Kai! I also ran.\r\nBut I gave every soldier thirty blows with a stick before I slept that\r\nnight. And you should have had your thirty, also, conforming to the\r\nYarlig, my Tougtchi.”\r\n\r\nSanang, still holding his hat and cane and carrying his overcoat over\r\nhis left arm, looked down at the heavy, brutal features of Gutchlug\r\nKhan—at the cruel mouth with its crooked smile under the grizzled\r\nbeard; at the huge hands—the powerful hands of a murderer—now deftly\r\nhoning to a razor-edge the Kalmuck knife held so firmly yet lightly in\r\nhis great blunt fingers.\r\n\r\n“Listen attentively, Prince Sanang,” growled Gutchlug, pausing in his\r\nmonotonous task to test the blade’s edge on his thumb—“Does the Yezidee\r\nKeuke Mongol live? Yes or no?”\r\n\r\nSanang hesitated, moistened his pallid lips. “She dares not betray us.”\r\n\r\n“By what pledge?”\r\n\r\n“Fear.”\r\n\r\n“That is no pledge. You also were afraid, yet you went to the temple!”\r\n\r\n“She has listened to the Yarlig. She has looked upon her shroud. She\r\nhas admitted that she desires to live. Therein lies her pledge to us.”\r\n\r\n“And she placed a yellow snake at your feet!” sneered Gutchlug. “Prince\r\nSanang, tell me, what man or what devil in all the chronicles of the\r\npast has ever tamed a Snow-Leopard?” And he continued to hone his\r\nyataghan.\r\n\r\n“Gutchlug——”\r\n\r\n“No, she dies,” said the other tranquilly.\r\n\r\n“Not yet!”\r\n\r\n“When, then?”\r\n\r\n“Gutchlug, thou knowest me. Hear my pledge! At her first gesture toward\r\ntreachery—her first thought of betrayal—I myself will end it all.”\r\n\r\n“You promise to slay this young snow-leopardess?”\r\n\r\n“By the four companions, I swear to kill her with my own hands!”\r\n\r\nGutchlug sneered. “Kill her—yes—with the kiss that has burned thy lips\r\nto ashes for all these months. I know thee, Sanang. Leave her to me.\r\nDead she will no longer trouble thee.”\r\n\r\n“Gutchlug!”\r\n\r\n“I hear, Prince Sanang.”\r\n\r\n“Strike when I nod. Not until then.”\r\n\r\n“I hear, Tougtchi. I understand thee, my Banneret. I whet my knife.\r\nKai!”\r\n\r\nSanang looked at him, put on his top-hat and overcoat, pulled on a pair\r\nof white evening gloves.\r\n\r\n“I go forth,” he said more pleasantly.\r\n\r\n“I remain here to talk to my seven ancestors and sharpen my knife,”\r\nremarked Gutchlug.\r\n\r\n“When the white world and the yellow world and the brown world and the\r\nblack world finally fall before the Hassanis,” said Sanang with a quick\r\nsmile, “I shall bring thee to her. Gutchlug—once—before she is veiled,\r\nthou shalt behold what is lovelier than Eve.”\r\n\r\nThe other stolidly whetted his knife.\r\n\r\nSanang pulled out a gold cigarette case, lighted a cigarette with an\r\nair.\r\n\r\n“I go among Germans,” he volunteered amiably. “The huns swam across two\r\noceans, but, like the unclean swine, it is their own throats they cut\r\nwhen they swim! Well, there is only one God. And not very many angels.\r\nErlik is greater. And there are many million devils to do his bidding.\r\nAdieu. There is rice and there is koumiss in the frozen closet. When I\r\nreturn you shall have been asleep for hours.”\r\n\r\nWhen Sanang left the hotel one of two young men seated in the hotel\r\nlobby got up and strolled out after him.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the other man went to the elevator, ascended to the\r\nfourth floor, and entered an apartment next to the one occupied by\r\nSanang.\r\n\r\nThere was another man there, lying on the lounge and smoking a cigar.\r\nWithout a word, they both went leisurely about the matter of disrobing\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\nWhen the shorter man who had been in the apartment when the other\r\nentered, and who was dark and curly-headed, had attired himself in\r\npyjamas, he sat down on one of the twin beds to enjoy his cigar to the\r\nbitter end.\r\n\r\n“Has Sanang gone out?” he inquired in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Benton went after him.”\r\n\r\nThe other man nodded. “Cleves,” he said, “I guess it looks as though\r\nthis Norne girl is in it, too.”\r\n\r\n“What happened?”\r\n\r\n“As soon as she arrived, Sanang made straight for her apartment. He\r\nremained inside for half an hour. Then he came out in a hurry and went\r\nto his own rooms, where that surly servant of his squats all day,\r\nshining up his arsenal, and drinking koumiss.”\r\n\r\n“Did you get their conversation?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a record of the gibberish. It requires an interpreter, of\r\ncourse.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so. I’ll take the records east with me to-morrow, and by the\r\nsame token I’d better notify New York that I’m leaving.”\r\n\r\nHe went, half-undressed, to the telephone, got the telegraph office,\r\nand sent the following message:\r\n\r\n“Recklow, _New York_:\r\n\r\n“Leaving to-morrow for N. Y. with samples. Retain expert in Oriental\r\nfabrics.\r\n\r\n“Victor Cleves.”\r\n\r\n“Report for me, too,” said the dark young man, who was still enjoying\r\nhis cigar on his pillows.\r\n\r\nSo Cleves sent another telegram, directed also to\r\n\r\n“Recklow, _New York_:\r\n\r\n“Benton and I are watching the market. Chinese importations fluctuate.\r\nRecent consignment per _Nan-yang Maru_ will be carefully inspected and\r\ndetails forwarded.\r\n\r\n“Alek Selden.”\r\n\r\nIn the next room Gutchlug could hear the voice of Cleves at the\r\ntelephone, but he merely shrugged his heavy shoulders in contempt. For\r\nhe had other things to do beside eavesdropping.\r\n\r\nAlso, for the last hour—in fact, ever since Sanang’s\r\ndeparture—something had been happening to him—something that happens to\r\na Hassani only once in a lifetime. And now this unique thing had\r\nhappened to him—to him, Gutchlug Khan—to him before whose Khiounnou\r\nancestors eighty-one thousand nations had bowed the knee.\r\n\r\nIt had come to him at last, this dread thing, unheralded, totally\r\nunexpected, a few minutes after Sanang had departed.\r\n\r\nAnd he suddenly knew he was going to die.\r\n\r\nAnd, when, presently, he comprehended it, he bent his grizzled head and\r\nlistened seriously. And, after a little silence, he heard his soul\r\nbidding him farewell.\r\n\r\nSo the chatter of white men at a telephone in the next apartment had no\r\nlonger any significance for him. Whether or not they had been spying on\r\nhim; whether they were plotting, made no difference to him now.\r\n\r\nHe tested his knife’s edge with his thumb and listened gravely to his\r\nsoul bidding him farewell.\r\n\r\nBut, for a Yezidee, there was still a little detail to attend to before\r\nhis soul departed;—two matters to regulate. One was to select his\r\nshroud. The other was to cut the white throat of this young\r\nsnow-leopardess called Keuke Mongol, the Yezidee temple girl.\r\n\r\nAnd he could steal down to her bedroom and finish that matter in five\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nBut first he must choose his shroud, as is the custom of the Yezidee.\r\n\r\nThat office, however, was quickly accomplished in a country where fine\r\nwhite sheets of linen are to be found on every hotel bed.\r\n\r\nSo, on his way to the door, his naked knife in his right hand, he\r\npaused to fumble under the bed-covers and draw out a white linen sheet.\r\n\r\nSomething hurt his hand like a needle. He moved it, felt the thing\r\nsquirm under his fingers and pierce his palm again and again. With a\r\nshriek, he tore the bedclothes from the bed.\r\n\r\nA little yellow snake lay coiled there.\r\n\r\nHe got as far as the telephone, but could not use it. And there he fell\r\nheavily, shaking the room and dragging the instrument down with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was some excitement. Cleves and Selden in their bathrobes went in\r\nto look at the body. The hotel physician diagnosed it as heart-trouble.\r\nOr, possibly, poison. Some gazed significantly at the naked knife still\r\nclutched in the dead man’s hands.\r\n\r\nAround the wrist of the other hand was twisted a pliable gold bracelet\r\nrepresenting a little snake. It had real emeralds for eyes.\r\n\r\nIt had not been there when Gutchlug died.\r\n\r\nBut nobody except Sanang could know that. And later when Sanang came\r\nback and found Gutchlug very dead on the bed and a policeman sitting\r\noutside, he offered no information concerning the new bracelet shaped\r\nlike a snake with real emeralds for eyes, which adorned the dead man’s\r\nleft wrist.\r\n\r\nToward evening, however, after an autopsy had confirmed the house\r\nphysician’s diagnosis that heart-disease had finished Gutchlug, Sanang\r\nmustered enough courage to go to the desk in the lobby and send up his\r\ncard to Miss Norne.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appeared, however, that Miss Norne had left for Chicago about noon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nGREY MAGIC\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Victor Cleves came the following telegram in code:\r\n\r\n“_Washington_\r\n“April 14th, 1919.”\r\n\r\n“_Investigation ordered by the State Department as the result of\r\nfrequent mention in despatches of Chinese troops operating with the\r\nRussian Bolsheviki forces has disclosed that the Bolsheviki are\r\nactually raising a Chinese division of 30,000 men recruited in Central\r\nAsia. This division has been guilty of the greatest cruelties. A\r\nstrange rumour prevails among the Allied forces at Archangel that this\r\nChinese division is led by Yezidee and Hassani officers belonging to\r\nthe sect of devil-worshipers and that they employ black arts and magic\r\nin battle._\r\n\r\n“_From information so far gathered by the several branches of the\r\nUnited States Secret Service operating throughout the world, it appears\r\npossible that the various revolutionary forces of disorder, in Europe\r\nand Asia, which now are violently threatening the peace and security,\r\nof all established civilisation on earth, may have had a common origin.\r\nThis origin, it is now suspected, may date back to a very remote epoch;\r\nthe wide-spread forces of violence and merciless destruction may have\r\nhad their beginning among some ancient and predatory race whose\r\nexistence was maintained solely by robbery and murder._\r\n\r\n“_Anarchists, terrorists, Bolshevists, Reds of all shades and degrees,\r\nare now believed to represent in modern times what perhaps once was a\r\ntribe of Assassins—a sect whose religion was founded upon a common\r\npredilection for crimes of violence._\r\n\r\n“_On this theory then, for the present, the United States Government\r\nwill proceed with this investigation of Bolshevism; and the Secret\r\nService will continue to pay particular attention to all Orientals in\r\nthe United States and other countries. You personally are formally\r\ninstructed to keep in touch with XLY-371 (Alek Selden) and ZB-303\r\n(James Benton), and to employ every possible means to become friendly\r\nwith the girl Tressa Norne, win her confidence, and, if possible,\r\nenlist her actively in the Government Service as your particular aid\r\nand comrade._\r\n\r\n“_It is equally important that the movements of the Oriental, called\r\nSanang, be carefully observed in order to discover the identity and\r\nwhereabouts of his companions. However, until further instructions he\r\nis not to be taken into custody. M. H. 2479._\r\n\r\n“_(Signed)_\r\n“(John Recklow.)”\r\n\r\nThe long despatch from John Recklow made Cleves’s duty plain enough.\r\n\r\nFor months, now, Selden and Benton had been watching Tressa Norne. And\r\nthey had learned practically nothing about her.\r\n\r\nAnd now the girl had come within Cleves’s sphere of operation. She had\r\nbeen in New York for two weeks. Telegrams from Benton in Chicago, and\r\nfrom Selden in Buffalo, had prepared him for her arrival.\r\n\r\nHe had his men watching her boarding-house on West Twenty-eighth\r\nStreet, men to follow her, men to keep their eyes on her at the\r\ntheatre, where every evening, at 10:45, her _entr’ acte_ was staged. He\r\nknew where to get her. But he, himself, had been on the watch for the\r\nman Sanang; and had failed to find the slightest trace of him in New\r\nYork, although warned that he had arrived.\r\n\r\nSo, for that evening, he left the hunt for Sanang to others, put on his\r\nevening clothes, and dined with fashionable friends at the Patroons’\r\nClub, who never for an instant suspected that young Victor Cleves was\r\nin the Service of the United States Government. About half-past nine he\r\nstrolled around to the theatre, desiring to miss as much as possible of\r\nthe popular show without being too late to see the curious little\r\n_entr’ acte_ in which this girl, Tressa Norne, appeared alone.\r\n\r\nHe had secured an aisle seat near the stage at an outrageous price; the\r\nmain show was still thundering and fizzing and glittering as he entered\r\nthe theatre; so he stood in the rear behind the orchestra until the\r\ndescending curtain extinguished the outrageous glare and din.\r\n\r\nThen he went down the aisle, and as he seated himself Tressa Norne\r\nstepped from the wings and stood before the lowered curtain facing an\r\nexpectant but oddly undemonstrative audience.\r\n\r\nThe girl worked rapidly, seriously, and in silence. She seemed a mere\r\nchild there behind the footlights, not more than sixteen anyway—her\r\nwinsome eyes and wistful lips unspoiled by the world’s wisdom.\r\n\r\nYet once or twice the mouth drooped for a second and the winning eyes\r\ndarkened to a remoter blue—the brooding iris hue of far horizons.\r\n\r\nShe wore the characteristic tabard of stiff golden tissue and the gold\r\npagoda-shaped headpiece of a Yezidee temple girl. Her flat,\r\nslipper-shaped foot-gear was of stiff gold, too, and curled upward at\r\nthe toes.\r\n\r\nAll this accentuated her apparent youth. For in face and throat no\r\nfirmer contours had as yet modified the soft fullness of immaturity;\r\nher limbs were boyish and frail, and her bosom more undecided still, so\r\nthat the embroidered breadth of gold fell flat and straight from her\r\nchest to a few inches above the ankles.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to have no stock of paraphernalia with which to aid the\r\nperformance; no assistant, no orchestral diversion, nor did she serve\r\nherself with any magician’s patter. She did her work close to the\r\nfootlights.\r\n\r\nBehind her loomed a black curtain; the strip of stage in front was bare\r\neven of carpet; the orchestra remained mute.\r\n\r\nBut when she needed anything—a little table, for example—well, it was\r\nsuddenly there where she required it—a tripod, for instance, evidently\r\nfitted to hold the big iridescent bubble of glass in which swarmed\r\nlittle tropical fishes—and which arrived neatly from nowhere. She\r\nmerely placed her hands before her as though ready to support something\r\nweighty which she expected and—suddenly, the huge crystal bubble was\r\nvisible, resting between her hands. And when she tired of holding it,\r\nshe set it upon the empty air and let go of it; and instead of crashing\r\nto the stage with its finny rainbow swarm of swimmers, out of thin air\r\nappeared a tripod to support it.\r\n\r\nApplause followed, not very enthusiastic, for the sort of audience\r\nwhich sustains the shows of which her performance was merely an _entr’\r\nacte_ is an audience responsive only to the obvious.\r\n\r\nNobody ever before had seen that sort of magic in America. People\r\nscarcely knew whether or not they quite liked it. The lightning of\r\ninnovation stupefies the dull; ignorance is always suspicious of\r\ninnovation—always afraid to put itself on record until its mind is made\r\nup by somebody else.\r\n\r\nSo in this typical New York audience approbation was cautious, but\r\nevery fascinated eye remained focused on this young girl who continued\r\nto do incredible things, which seemed to resemble “putting something\r\nover” on them; a thing which no uneducated American conglomeration ever\r\nquite forgives.\r\n\r\nThe girl’s silence, too, perplexed them; they were accustomed to\r\ngabble, to noise, to jazz, vocal and instrumental, to that incessant\r\nmetropolitan clamour which fills every second with sound in a city\r\nwhose only distinction is its din. Stage, press, art, letters, social\r\nexistence unless noisy mean nothing in Gotham; reticence, leisure,\r\nrepose are the three lost arts. The megaphone is the city’s symbol; its\r\nchiefest crime, silence.\r\n\r\nThe girl having finished with the big glass bubble full of tiny fish,\r\npicked it up and tossed it aside. For a moment it apparently floated\r\nthere in space like a soap-bubble. Changing rainbow tints waxed and\r\nwaned on the surface, growing deeper and more gorgeous until the\r\nfloating globe glowed scarlet, then suddenly burst into flame and\r\nvanished. And only a strange, sweet perfume lingered in the air.\r\n\r\nBut she gave her perplexed audience no time to wonder; she had seated\r\nherself on the stage and was already swiftly busy unfolding a white\r\nveil with which she presently covered herself, draping it over her like\r\na tent.\r\n\r\nThe veil seemed to be translucent; she was apparently visible seated\r\nbeneath it. But the veil turned into smoke, rising into the air in a\r\nthin white cloud; and there, where she had been seated, was a statue of\r\nwhite stone the image of herself!—in all the frail springtide of early\r\nadolescence—a white statue, cold, opaque, exquisite in its sculptured\r\nimmobility.\r\n\r\nThere came, the next moment, a sound of distant thunder; flashes\r\nlighted the blank curtain; and suddenly a vein of lightning and a\r\nsharper peal shattered the statue to fragments.\r\n\r\nThere they lay, broken bits of her own sculptured body, glistening in a\r\nheap behind the footlights. Then each fragment began to shimmer with a\r\nrosy internal light of its own, until the pile of broken marble glowed\r\nlike living coals under thickening and reddening vapours. And,\r\npresently, dimly perceptible, there she was in the flesh again, seated\r\nin the fiery centre of the conflagration, stretching her arms\r\nluxuriously, yawning, seemingly awakening from refreshing slumber, her\r\neyes unclosing to rest with a sort of confused apology upon her\r\nastounded audience.\r\n\r\nAs she rose to her feet nothing except herself remained on the stage—no\r\ndébris, not a shred of smoke, not a spark.\r\n\r\nShe came down, then, across an inclined plank into the orchestra among\r\nthe audience.\r\n\r\nIn the aisle seat nearest her sat Victor Cleves. His business was to be\r\nthere that evening. But she didn’t know that, knew nothing about\r\nhim—had never before set eyes on him.\r\n\r\nAt her gesture of invitation he made a cup of both his hands. Into\r\nthese she poured a double handful of unset diamonds—or what appeared to\r\nbe diamonds—pressed her own hands above his for a second—and the\r\ndiamonds in his palms had become pearls.\r\n\r\nThese were passed around to people in the vicinity, and finally\r\nreturned to Mr. Cleves, who, at her request, covered the heap of pearls\r\nwith both his hands, hiding them entirely from view.\r\n\r\nAt her nod he uncovered them. The pearls had become emeralds. Again,\r\nwhile he held them, and without even touching him, she changed them\r\ninto rubies. Then she turned away from him, apparently forgetting that\r\nhe still held the gems, and he sat very still, one cupped hand over the\r\nother, while she poured silver coins into a woman’s gloved hands,\r\nturned them into gold coins, then flung each coin into the air, where\r\nit changed to a living, fragrant rose and fell among the audience.\r\n\r\nPresently she seemed to remember Cleve, came back down the aisle, and\r\nunder his close and intent gaze drew from his cupped hands, one by one,\r\na score of brilliant little living birds, which continually flew about\r\nher and finally perched, twittering, on her golden headdress—a\r\nrainbow-crest of living jewels.\r\n\r\nAs she drew the last warm, breathing little feathered miracle from\r\nCleves’s hands and released it, he said rapidly under his breath: “I\r\nwant a word with you later. Where?”\r\n\r\nShe let her clear eyes rest on him for a moment, then with a shrug so\r\nslight that it was perceptible, perhaps, only to him, she moved on\r\nalong the inclined way, stepped daintily over the footlights, caught\r\nfire, apparently, nodded to a badly rattled audience, and sauntered\r\noff, burning from head to foot.\r\n\r\nWhat applause there was became merged in a dissonant instrumental\r\noutburst from the orchestra; the great god Jazz resumed direction, the\r\nmindless audience breathed freely again as the curtain rose upon a\r\nfamiliar, yelling turbulence, including all that Gotham really\r\nunderstands and cares for—legs and noise.\r\n\r\nVictor Cleves glanced up at the stage, then continued to study the name\r\nof the girl on the programme. It was featured in rather pathetic\r\nsolitude under “_Entr’ acte_.” And he read further: “During the _entr’\r\nacte_ Miss Tressa Norne will entertain you with several phases of Black\r\nMagic. This strange knowledge was acquired by Miss Norne from the\r\nYezidees, among which almost unknown people still remain descendants of\r\nthat notorious and formidable historic personage known in the twelfth\r\ncentury as The Old Man of the Mountain—or The Old Man of Mount Alamout.\r\n\r\n“The pleasant profession of this historic individual was assassination;\r\nand some historians now believe that genuine occult power played a part\r\nin his dreadful record—a record which terminated only when the infantry\r\nof Genghis Khan took Mount Alamout by storm and hanged the Old Man of\r\nthe Mountain and burned his body under a boulder of You-Stone.\r\n\r\n“For Miss Norne’s performance there appears to be no plausible,\r\npractical or scientific explanation.\r\n\r\n“During her performance the curtain will remain lowered for fifteen\r\nminutes and will then rise on the last act of ‘You Betcha Life.’”\r\n\r\nThe noisy show continued while Cleves, paying it scant attention,\r\nbrooded over the programme. And ever his keen, grey eyes reverted to\r\nher name, Tressa Norne.\r\n\r\nThen, for a little while, he settled back and let his absent gaze\r\nwander over the galloping battalions of painted girls and the slapstick\r\nprincipals whose perpetual motion evoked screams of approbation from\r\nthe audience amid the din of the great god Jazz.\r\n\r\nHe had an aisle seat; he disturbed nobody when he went out and around\r\nto the stage door.\r\n\r\nThe aged man on duty took his card, called a boy and sent it off. The\r\nboy returned with the card, saying that Miss Norne had already dressed\r\nand departed.\r\n\r\nCleves tipped him and then tipped the doorman heavily.\r\n\r\n“Where does she live?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Say,” said the old man, “I dunno, and that’s straight. But them ladies\r\nmostly goes up to the roof for a look in at the ‘Moonlight Masque’ and\r\na dance afterward. Was you ever up there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Seen the new show?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, g’wan up while you can get a table. And I bet the little girl\r\nwill be somewheres around.”\r\n\r\n“The little girl” _was_ “somewheres around.” He secured a table, turned\r\nand looked about at the vast cabaret into which only a few people had\r\nyet filtered, and saw her at a distance in the carpeted corridor buying\r\nviolets from one of the flower-girls.\r\n\r\nA waiter placed a reserve card on his table; he continued on around the\r\nouter edge of the auditorium.\r\n\r\nMiss Norne had already seated herself at a small table in the rear, and\r\na waiter was serving her with iced orange juice and little French\r\ncakes.\r\n\r\nWhen the waiter returned Cleves went up and took off his hat.\r\n\r\n“May I talk with you for a moment, Miss Norne?” he said.\r\n\r\nThe girl looked up, the wheat-straw still between her scarlet lips.\r\nThen, apparently recognising in him the young man in the audience who\r\nhad spoken to her, she resumed her business of imbibing orange juice.\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed even frailer and younger in her hat and street gown. A\r\nsilver-fox stole hung from her shoulders; a gold bag lay on the table\r\nunder the bunch of violets.\r\n\r\nShe paid no attention whatever to him. Presently her wheat-straw\r\nbuckled, and she selected a better one.\r\n\r\nHe said: “There’s something rather serious I’d like to speak to you\r\nabout if you’ll let me. I’m not the sort you evidently suppose. I’m not\r\ntrying to annoy you.”\r\n\r\nAt that she looked around and upward once more.\r\n\r\nVery, very young, but already spoiled, he thought, for the dark-blue\r\neyes were coolly appraising him, and the droop of the mouth had become\r\nalmost sullen. Besides, traces of paint still remained to incarnadine\r\nlip and cheek and there was a hint of hardness in the youthful\r\nplumpness of the features.\r\n\r\n“Are you a professional?” she asked without curiosity.\r\n\r\n“A theatrical man? No.”\r\n\r\n“Then if you haven’t anything to offer me, what is it you wish?”\r\n\r\n“I have a job to offer if you care for it and if you are up to it,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHer eyes became slightly hostile:\r\n\r\n“What kind of job do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I want to learn something about you first. Will you come over to my\r\ntable and talk it over?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“What sort do you suppose me to be?” he inquired, amused.\r\n\r\n“The usual sort, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“You mean a Johnny?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—of sorts.”\r\n\r\nShe let her insolent eyes sweep him once more, from head to foot.\r\n\r\nHe was a well-built young man and in his evening dress he had that\r\nsomething about him which placed him very definitely where he really\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\n“Would you mind looking at my card?” he asked.\r\n\r\nHe drew it out and laid it beside her, and without stirring she scanned\r\nit sideways.\r\n\r\n“That’s my name and address,” he continued. “I’m not contemplating\r\nmischief. I’ve enough excitement in life without seeking adventure.\r\nBesides, I’m not the sort who goes about annoying women.”\r\n\r\nShe glanced up at him again:\r\n\r\n“You are annoying me!”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry. I was quite honest. Good-night.”\r\n\r\nHe took his _congé_ with unhurried amiability; had already turned away\r\nwhen she said:\r\n\r\n“Please ... what do you desire to say to me?” He came back to her\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t tell you until I know a little more about you.”\r\n\r\n“What—do you wish to know?”\r\n\r\n“Several things. I could scarcely ask you—go over such matters with\r\nyou—standing here.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause; the girl juggled with the straw on the table for a\r\nfew moments, then, partly turning, she summoned a waiter, paid him,\r\nadjusted her stole, picked up her gold bag and her violets and stood\r\nup. Then she turned to Cleves and gave him a direct look, which had in\r\nit the impersonal and searching gaze of a child.\r\n\r\nWhen they were seated at the table reserved for him the place already\r\nwas filling rapidly—backwash from the theatres slopped through every\r\naisle—people not yet surfeited with noise, not yet sufficiently sodden\r\nby their worship of the great god Jazz.\r\n\r\n“Jazz,” said Cleves, glancing across his dinner-card at Tressa\r\nNorne—“what’s the meaning of the word? Do you happen to know?”\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t it come from the French ‘_jaser_’?”\r\n\r\nHe smiled. “Possibly. I’m rather hungry. Are you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Will you indicate your preferences?”\r\n\r\nShe studied her card, and presently he gave the order.\r\n\r\n“I’d like some champagne,” she said, “unless you think it’s too\r\nexpensive.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled at that, too, and gave the order.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t suggest any wine because you seem so young,” he said.\r\n\r\n“How old do I seem?”\r\n\r\n“Sixteen perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“I am twenty-one.”\r\n\r\n“Then you’ve had no troubles.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you call trouble,” she remarked, indifferently,\r\nwatching the arriving throngs.\r\n\r\nThe orchestra, too, had taken its place.\r\n\r\n“Well,” she said, “now that you’ve picked me up, what do you really\r\nwant of me?” There was no mitigating smile to soften what she said. She\r\ndropped her elbows on the table, rested her chin between her palms and\r\nlooked at him with the same searching, undisturbed expression that is\r\nso disconcerting in children. As he made no reply: “May I have a\r\ncocktail?” she inquired.\r\n\r\nHe gave the order. And his mind registered pessimism. “There is nothing\r\ndoing with this girl,” he thought. “She’s already on the toboggan.” But\r\nhe said aloud: “That was beautiful work you did down in the theatre,\r\nMiss Norne.”\r\n\r\n“Did you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Of course. It was astounding work.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. But managers and audiences differ with you.”\r\n\r\n“Then they are very stupid,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Possibly. But that does not help me pay my board.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean you have trouble in securing theatrical engagements?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am through here to-night, and there’s nothing else in view, so\r\nfar.”\r\n\r\n“That’s incredible!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her glass, slowly drained it.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments she caressed the stem of the empty glass, her gaze\r\nremote.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s that way,” she said. “From the beginning I felt that my\r\naudiences were not in sympathy with me. Sometimes it even amounts to\r\nhostility. Americans do not like what I do, even if it holds their\r\nattention. I don’t quite understand why they don’t like it, but I’m\r\nalways conscious they don’t. And of course that settles it—to-night has\r\nsettled the whole thing, once and for all.”\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“What others do, I presume.”\r\n\r\n“What do others do?” he inquired, watching the lovely sullen eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh, they do what I’m doing now, don’t they?—let some man pick them up\r\nand feed them.” She lifted her indifferent eyes. “I’m not criticising\r\nyou. I meant to do it some day—when I had courage. That’s why I just\r\nasked you if I might have some champagne—finding myself a little scared\r\nat my first step.... But you _did_ say you might have a job for me.\r\nDidn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Suppose I haven’t. What are you going to do?”\r\n\r\nThe curtain was rising. She nodded toward the bespangled chorus.\r\n“Probably that sort of thing. They’ve asked me.”\r\n\r\nSupper was served. They both were hungry and thirsty; the music made\r\nconversation difficult, so they supped in silence and watched the\r\nimbecile show conceived by vulgarians, produced by vulgarians and\r\nserved up to mental degenerates of the same species—the average\r\nmetropolitan audience.\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes a pair of comedians fell up and down a flight of steps,\r\nand the audience shrieked approval.\r\n\r\n“Miss Norne?”\r\n\r\nThe girl who had been watching the show turned in her chair and looked\r\nback at him.\r\n\r\n“Your magic is by far the most wonderful I have ever seen or heard of.\r\nEven in India such things are not done.”\r\n\r\n“No, not in India,” she said, indifferently.\r\n\r\n“Where then?”\r\n\r\n“In China.”\r\n\r\n“You learned to do such things there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Where, in China, did you learn such amazing magic?”\r\n\r\n“In Yian.”\r\n\r\n“I never heard of it. Is it a province?”\r\n\r\n“A city.”\r\n\r\n“And you lived there?”\r\n\r\n“Fourteen years.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“From 1904 to 1918.”\r\n\r\n“During the great war,” he remarked, “you were in China?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then you arrived here very recently.”\r\n\r\n“In November, from the Coast.”\r\n\r\n“I see. You played the theatres from the Coast eastward.”\r\n\r\n“And went to pieces in New York,” she added calmly, finishing her glass\r\nof champagne.\r\n\r\n“Have you any family?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Do you care to say anything further?” he inquired, pleasantly.\r\n\r\n“About my family? Yes, if you wish. My father was in the spice trade in\r\nYian. The Yezidees took Yian in 1910, threw him into a well in his own\r\ncompound and filled it up with dead imperial troops. I was thirteen\r\nyears old.... The Hassani did that. They held Yian nearly eight years,\r\nand I lived with my mother, in a garden pagoda, until 1914. In January\r\nof that year Germans got through from Kiaou-Chou. They had been six\r\nmonths on the way. I think they were Hassanis. Anyway, they persuaded\r\nthe Hassanis to massacre every English-speaking prisoner. And so—my\r\nmother died in the garden pagoda of Yian.... I was not told for four\r\nyears.”\r\n\r\n“Why did they spare you?” he asked, astonished at her story so quietly\r\ntold, so utterly destitute of emotion.\r\n\r\n“I was seventeen. A certain person had placed me among the temple girls\r\nin the temple of Erlik. It pleased this person to make of me a Mongol\r\ntemple girl as a mockery at Christ. They gave me the name Keuke Mongol.\r\nI asked to serve the shrine of Kwann-an—she being like to our Madonna.\r\nBut this person gave me the choice between the halberds of the\r\nTchortchas and the sorcery of Erlik.”\r\n\r\nShe lifted her sombre eyes. “So I learned how to do the things you saw.\r\nBut—what I did there on the stage is not—respectable.”\r\n\r\nAn odd shiver passed over him. For a second he took her literally,\r\nsuddenly convinced that her magic was not white but black as the demon\r\nat whose shrine she had learned it. Then he smiled and asked her\r\npleasantly, whether indeed she employed hypnosis in her miraculous\r\nexhibitions.\r\n\r\nBut her eyes became more sombre still, and, “I don’t care to talk about\r\nit,” she said. “I have already said too much.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to pry into professional secrets——”\r\n\r\n“I can’t talk about it,” she repeated. “... Please—my glass is quite\r\nempty.”\r\n\r\nWhen he had refilled it:\r\n\r\n“How did you get away from Yian?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“The Japanese.”\r\n\r\n“What luck!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. One battle was fought at Buldak. The Hassanis and Blue Flags were\r\nterribly cut up. Then, outside the walls of Yian, Prince Sanang’s\r\nTchortcha infantry made a stand. He was there with his Yezidee\r\nhorsemen, all in leather and silk armour with casques and corselets of\r\nblack Indian steel.\r\n\r\n“I could see them from the temple—saw the Japanese gunners open fire.\r\nThe Tchortchas were blown to shreds in the blast of the Japanese\r\nguns.... Sanang got away with some of his Yezidee horsemen.”\r\n\r\n“Where was that battle?”\r\n\r\n“I told you, outside the walls of Yian.”\r\n\r\n“The newspapers never mentioned any such trouble in China,” he said,\r\nsuspiciously.\r\n\r\n“Nobody knows about it except the Germans and the Japanese.”\r\n\r\n“Who is this Sanang?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“A Yezidee-Mongol. He is one of the Sheiks-el-Djebel—a servant of The\r\nOld Man of Mount Alamout.”\r\n\r\n“What is _he_?”\r\n\r\n“A sorcerer—assassin.”\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed Cleves incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” she said, calmly. “Have you never heard of The Old Man of\r\nMount Alamout?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes——”\r\n\r\n“The succession has been unbroken since 1090 B.C.A Hassan Sabbah is\r\nstill the present Old Man of the Mountain. His Yezidees worship Erlik.\r\nThey are sorcerers. But you would not believe that.”\r\n\r\nCleves said with a smile, “Who is Erlik?”\r\n\r\n“The Mongols’ Satan.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! So these Yezidees are devil-worshipers!”\r\n\r\n“They are more. They _are_ actually devils.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t really believe that even in unexplored China there exists\r\nsuch a creature as a real sorcerer, do you?” he inquired, smilingly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t wish to talk of it.”\r\n\r\nTo his surprise her face had flushed, and he thought her sensitive\r\nmouth quivered a little.\r\n\r\nHe watched her in silence for a moment; then, leaning a little way\r\nacross the table:\r\n\r\n“Where are you going when the show here closes?”\r\n\r\n“To my boarding-house.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“To bed,” she said, sullenly.\r\n\r\n“And to-morrow what do you mean to do?”\r\n\r\n“Go out to the agencies and ask for work.”\r\n\r\n“And if there is none?”\r\n\r\n“The chorus,” she said, indifferently.\r\n\r\n“What salary have you been getting?”\r\n\r\nShe told him.\r\n\r\n“Will you take three times that amount and work with me?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nBODY AND SOUL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe girl’s direct gaze met his with that merciless searching intentness\r\nhe already knew.\r\n\r\n“What do you wish me to do?”\r\n\r\n“Enter the service of the United States.”\r\n\r\n“Wh-what?”\r\n\r\n“Work for the Government.”\r\n\r\nShe was too taken aback to answer.\r\n\r\n“Where were you born?” he demanded abruptly.\r\n\r\n“In Albany, New York,” she replied in a dazed way.\r\n\r\n“You are loyal to your country?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—certainly.”\r\n\r\n“You would not betray her?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean for money; I mean from fear.”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, and, avoiding his gaze: “I am afraid of death,” she\r\nsaid very simply.\r\n\r\nHe waited.\r\n\r\n“I—I don’t know what I might do—being afraid,” she added in a troubled\r\nvoice. “I desire to—live.”\r\n\r\nHe still waited.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her eyes: “I’d try not to betray my country,” she murmured.\r\n\r\n“Try to face death for your country’s honour?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And for your own?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and for my own.”\r\n\r\nHe leaned nearer: “Yet you’re taking a chance on your own honour\r\nto-night.”\r\n\r\nShe blushed brightly: “I didn’t think I was taking a very great chance\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\nHe said: “You have found life too hard. And when you faced failure in\r\nNew York you began to let go of life—real life, I mean. And you came up\r\nhere to-night wondering whether you had courage to let yourself go.\r\nWhen I spoke to you it scared you. You found you hadn’t the courage.\r\nBut perhaps to-morrow you might find it—or next week—if sufficiently\r\nscared by hunger—you might venture to take the first step along the\r\npath that you say others usually take sooner or later.”\r\n\r\nThe girl flushed scarlet, sat looking at him out of eyes grown dark\r\nwith anger.\r\n\r\nHe said: “You told me an untruth. You _have_ been tempted to betray\r\nyour country. You have resisted. You _have_ been threatened with death.\r\nYou _have_ had courage to defy threats and temptations where your\r\ncountry’s honour was concerned!”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?” she demanded.\r\n\r\nHe continued, ignoring the question: “From the time you landed in San\r\nFrancisco you have been threatened. You tried to earn a living by your\r\nmagician’s tricks, but in city after city, as you came East, your\r\nuneasiness grew into fear, and your fear into terror, because every day\r\nmore terribly confirmed your belief that people were following you\r\ndetermined either to use you to their own purposes or to murder you——”\r\n\r\nThe girl turned quite white and half rose in her chair, then sank back,\r\nstaring at him out of dilated eyes. Then Cleves smiled: “So you’ve got\r\nthe nerve to do Government work,” he said, “and you’ve got the\r\nintelligence, and the knowledge, and something else—I don’t know\r\nexactly what to call it—Skill? Dexterity? Sorcery?” he smiled—“I mean\r\nyour professional ability. That’s what I want—that bewildering\r\ndexterity of yours, to help your own country in the fight of its life.\r\nWill you enlist for service?”\r\n\r\n“W-what fight?” she asked faintly.\r\n\r\n“The fight with the Red Spectre.”\r\n\r\n“Anarchy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.... Are you ready to leave this place? I want to talk to you.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“In my own rooms.”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment she rose.\r\n\r\n“I’ll go to your rooms with you,” she said. She added very calmly that\r\nshe was glad it was to be his rooms and not some other man’s.\r\n\r\nOut of countenance, he demanded what she meant, and she said quite\r\ncandidly that she’d made up her mind to live at any cost, and that if\r\nshe couldn’t make an honest living she’d make a living anyway.\r\n\r\nHe offered no reply to this until they had reached the street and he\r\nhad called a taxi.\r\n\r\nOn their way to his apartment he re-opened the subject rather bluntly,\r\nremarking that life was not worth living at the price she had\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n“That is the accepted Christian theory,” she replied coolly, “but\r\ncircumstances alter things.”\r\n\r\n“Not such things.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, they do. If one is already damned, what difference does\r\nanything else make?”\r\n\r\nHe asked, sarcastically, whether she considered herself already damned.\r\n\r\nShe did not reply for a few moments, then she said, in a quick,\r\nbreathless way, that souls have been entrapped through ignorance of\r\nevil. And asked him if he did not believe it.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, “I don’t.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “You couldn’t understand,” she said. “But I’ve made\r\nup my mind to one thing; even if my soul has perished, my body shall\r\nnot die for a long, long time. I mean to live,” she added. “I shall not\r\nlet my body be slain! They shall not steal life from me, whatever they\r\nhave done to my soul——”\r\n\r\n“What in heaven’s name are you talking about?” he exclaimed. “Do you\r\nactually believe in soul-snatchers and life-stealers?”\r\n\r\nShe seemed sullen, her profile turned to him, her eyes on the\r\nbrilliantly lighted avenue up which they were speeding. After a while:\r\n“I’d rather live decently and respectably if I can,” she said. “That is\r\nthe natural desire of any girl, I suppose. But if I can’t, nevertheless\r\nI shall beat off death at any cost. And whatever the price of life is,\r\nI shall pay it. Because I am absolutely determined to go on living. And\r\nif I can’t provide the means I’ll have to let some man do it, I\r\nsuppose.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a good thing it was I who found you when you were out of a job,”\r\nhe remarked coldly.\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” she said. “Even in the beginning I didn’t really believe\r\nyou meant to be impertinent”—a tragic smile touched her lips—“and I was\r\nalmost sorry——”\r\n\r\n“Are you quite crazy?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“No, my mind is untouched. It’s my soul that’s gone.... Do you know I\r\nwas very hungry when you spoke to me? The management wouldn’t advance\r\nanything, and my last money went for my room.... Last Monday I had\r\nthree dollars to face the future—and no job. I spent the last of it\r\nto-night on violets, orange juice and cakes. My furs and my gold bag\r\nremain. I can go two months more on them. Then it’s a job or——.” She\r\nshrugged and buried her nose in her violets.\r\n\r\n“Suppose I advance you a month’s salary?” he said.\r\n\r\n“What am I to do for it?”\r\n\r\nThe taxi stopped at a florist’s on the corner of Madison Avenue and\r\n58th Street. Overhead were apartments. There was no elevator—merely the\r\nstreet door to unlock and four dim flights of stairs rising steeply to\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nHe lived on the top floor. As they paused before his door in the dim\r\ncorridor:\r\n\r\n“Are you afraid?” he asked.\r\n\r\nShe came nearer, laid a hand on his arm:\r\n\r\n“Are _you_ afraid?”\r\n\r\nHe stood silent, the latch-key in his hand.\r\n\r\n“I’m not afraid of myself—if that is what you mean,” he said.\r\n\r\n“That is partly what I mean ... you’ll have to mount guard over your\r\nsoul.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll look out for my soul,” he retorted dryly.\r\n\r\n“Do so. I lost mine. I—I would not wish any harm to yours through our\r\ncompanionship.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you worry about my soul,” he remarked, fitting the key to the\r\nlock. But again her hand fell on his wrist:\r\n\r\n“Wait. I can’t—can’t help warning you. Neither your soul nor your body\r\nare safe if—if you ever do make of me a companion. I’ve _got_ to tell\r\nyou this!”\r\n\r\n“What are you talking about?” he demanded bluntly.\r\n\r\n“Because you have been courteous—considerate—and you _don’t_ know—oh,\r\nyou don’t realise what spiritual peril is!—What your soul and body have\r\nto fear if you—if you win me over—if you ever manage to make of me a\r\nfriend!”\r\n\r\nHe said: “People follow and threaten you. We know that. I understand\r\nalso that association with you involves me, and that I shall no doubt\r\nbe menaced with bodily harm.”\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand on hers where it still rested on his sleeves:\r\n\r\n“But that’s my business, Miss Norne,” he added with a smile. “So,\r\notherwise, it being merely a plain business affair between you and me,\r\nI think I may also venture my immortal soul alone with you in my room.”\r\n\r\nThe girl flushed darkly.\r\n\r\n“You have misunderstood,” she said.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her coolly, intently; and arrived at no conclusion. Young,\r\nvery lovely, confessedly without moral principle, he still could not\r\nbelieve her actually depraved. “What did you mean?” he said bluntly.\r\n\r\n“In companionship with the lost, one might lose one’s way—unawares....\r\nDo you know that there is an Evil loose in the world which is bent upon\r\nconquest by _obtaining control of men’s minds_?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied, amused.\r\n\r\n“And that, through the capture of men’s minds and souls the destruction\r\nof civilisation is being planned?”\r\n\r\n“Is that what you learned in your captivity, Miss Norne?”\r\n\r\n“You do not believe me.”\r\n\r\n“I believe your terrible experiences in China have shaken you to your\r\ntragic little soul. Horror and grief and loneliness have left scars on\r\ntender, impressionable youth. They would have slain maturity—broken it,\r\ncrushed it. But youth is flexible, pliable, and bends—gives way under\r\npressure. Scars become slowly effaced. It shall be so with you. You\r\nwill learn to understand that nothing really can harm the soul.”\r\n\r\nFor a few moments’ silence they stood facing each other on the dim\r\nlanding outside his locked door.\r\n\r\n“Nothing can slay our souls,” he repeated in a grave voice. “I do not\r\nbelieve you really ever have done anything to wound even your\r\nself-respect. I do not believe you are capable of it, or ever have\r\nbeen, or ever will be. But somebody has deeply wounded you,\r\nspiritually, and has wounded your mind to persuade you that your soul\r\nis no longer in God’s keeping. For that is a lie!”\r\n\r\nHe saw her features working with poignant emotions as though struggling\r\nto believe him.\r\n\r\n“Souls are never lost,” he said. “Ungoverned passions of every sort\r\nmerely cripple them for a space. God always heals them in the end.”\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand on the door-knob once more and lifted the latch-key.\r\n\r\n“Don’t!” she whispered, catching his hand again, “if there should be\r\nsomebody in there waiting for us!”\r\n\r\n“There is not a soul in my rooms. My servant sleeps out.”\r\n\r\n“There _is_ somebody there!” she said, trembling.\r\n\r\n“Nobody, Miss Norne. Will you come in with me?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t dare——”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“You and I alone together—no! oh, please—please! I am afraid!”\r\n\r\n“Of what?”\r\n\r\n“Of—giving you—my c-confidence—and trust—and—and f-friendship.”\r\n\r\n“I want you to.”\r\n\r\n“I must not! It would destroy us both, soul and body!”\r\n\r\n“I tell you,” he said, impatiently, “that there is no destruction of\r\nthe soul—and it’s a clean comradeship anyway—a fighting friendship I\r\nask of you—_all_ I ask; all I offer! Wherein, then, lies this peril in\r\nbeing alone together?”\r\n\r\n“Because I am finding it in my heart to believe in you, trust you, hold\r\nfast to your strength and protection. And if I give way—yield—and if I\r\nmake you a promise—and _if there is anybody in that room to see us and\r\nhear us—then_ we shall be destroyed, both of us, soul and body——”\r\n\r\nHe took her hands, held them until their trembling ceased.\r\n\r\n“I’ll answer for our bodies. Let God look after the rest. Will you\r\ntrust Him?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n“And me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nBut her face blanched as he turned the latch-key, switched on the\r\nelectric light, and preceded her into the room beyond.\r\n\r\nThe place was one of those accentless, typical bachelor apartments made\r\ncomfortable for anything masculine, but quite unlivable otherwise.\r\n\r\nLive coals still glowed in the hob grate; he placed a lump of cannel\r\ncoal on the embers, used a bellows vigorously and the flame caught with\r\na greasy crackle.\r\n\r\nThe girl stood motionless until he pulled up an easy chair for her,\r\nthen he found another for himself. She let slip her furs, folded her\r\nhands around the bunch of violets and waited.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said, “I’ll come to the point. In 1916 I was at Plattsburg,\r\nexpecting a commission. The Department of Justice sent for me. I went\r\nto Washington where I was made to understand that I had been selected\r\nto serve my country in what is vaguely known as the Secret Service—and\r\nwhich includes government agents attached to several departments.\r\n\r\n“The great war is over; but I am still retained in the service. Because\r\nsomething more sinister than a hun victory over civilisation threatens\r\nthis Republic. And threatens the civilised world.”\r\n\r\n“Anarchy,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Bolshevism.”\r\n\r\nShe did not stir in her chair.\r\n\r\nShe had become very white. She said nothing. He looked at her with his\r\nquiet, reassuring smile.\r\n\r\n“That’s what I want of you,” he repeated.\r\n\r\n“I want your help,” he went on, “I want your valuable knowledge of the\r\nOrient. I want whatever secret information you possess. I want your\r\nrather amazing gifts, your unprecedented experience among almost\r\nunknown people, your familiarity with occult things, your astounding\r\npowers—whatever they are—hypnotic, psychic, material.\r\n\r\n“Because, to-day, civilisation is engaged in a secret battle for\r\nexistence against gathering powers of violence, the force and limit of\r\nwhich are still unguessed.\r\n\r\n“It is a battle between righteousness and evil, between sanity and\r\ninsanity, light and darkness, God and Satan! And if civilisation does\r\nnot win, then the world perishes.”\r\n\r\nShe raised her still eyes to his, but made no other movement.\r\n\r\n“Miss Norne,” he said, “we in the International Service know enough\r\nabout you to desire to know more.\r\n\r\n“We already knew the story you have told to me. Agents in the\r\nInternational Secret Service kept in touch with you from the time that\r\nthe Japanese escorted you out of China.\r\n\r\n“From the day you landed, and all across the Continent to New York, you\r\nhave been kept in view by agents of this government.\r\n\r\n“Here, in New York, my men have kept in touch with you. And now,\r\nto-night, the moment has come for a personal understanding between you\r\nand me.”\r\n\r\nThe girl’s pale lips moved—became stiffly articulate: “I—I wish to\r\nlive,” she stammered, “I fear death.”\r\n\r\n“I know it. I know what I ask when I ask your help.”\r\n\r\nShe said in the ghost of a voice: “If I turn against _them_—they will\r\nkill me.”\r\n\r\n“They’ll try,” he said quietly.\r\n\r\n“They will not fail, Mr. Cleves.”\r\n\r\n“That is in God’s hands.”\r\n\r\nShe became deathly white at that.\r\n\r\n“No,” she burst out in an agonised voice, “it is not in God’s hands! If\r\nit were, I should not be afraid! It is in the hands of those who stole\r\nmy soul!”\r\n\r\nShe covered her face with both arms, fairly writhing on her chair.\r\n\r\n“If the Yezidees have actually made you believe any such nonsense”—he\r\nbegan; but she dropped her arms and stared at him out of terrible blue\r\neyes:\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to die, I tell you! I am afraid!—_afraid_! If I reveal to\r\nyou what I know they’ll kill me. If I turn against them and aid you,\r\nthey’ll slay my body, and send it after my soul!”\r\n\r\nShe was trembling so violently that he sprang up and went to her. After\r\na moment he passed one arm around her shoulders and held her firmly,\r\nclose to him.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he said, “do your duty. Those who enlist under the banner of\r\nChrist have nothing to dread in this world or the next.”\r\n\r\n“If—if I could believe I were safe there.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you that you are. So is every human soul! What mad nonsense\r\nhave the Yezidees made you believe? Is there any surer salvation for\r\nthe soul than to die in Christ’s service?”\r\n\r\nHe slipped his arm from her quivering shoulders and grasped both her\r\nhands, crushing them as though to steady every fibre in her tortured\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n“I want you to live. I want to live, too. But I tell you it’s in God’s\r\nhands, and we soldiers of civilisation have nothing to fear except\r\nfailure to do our duty. Now, then, are we comrades under the United\r\nStates Government?”\r\n\r\n“O God—I—dare not!”\r\n\r\n“_Are_ we?”\r\n\r\nPerhaps she felt the physical pain of his crushing grip for she turned\r\nand looked him in the eyes.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to die,” she whispered. “Don’t make me!”\r\n\r\n“Will you help your country?”\r\n\r\nThe terrible directness of her child’s gaze became almost unendurable\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n“Will you offer your country your soul and body?” he insisted in a low,\r\ntense voice.\r\n\r\nHer stiff lips formed a word.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment she rested against his shoulder, deathly white, then in a\r\nflash she had straightened, was on her feet in one bound and so swiftly\r\nthat he scarcely followed her movement—was unaware that she had risen\r\nuntil he saw her standing there with a pistol glittering in her hand,\r\nher eyes fixed on the portières that hung across the corridor leading\r\nto his bedroom.\r\n\r\n“What on earth,” he began, but she interrupted him, keeping her gaze\r\nfocused on the curtains, and the pistol resting level on her hip.\r\n\r\n“I’ll answer you if I die for it!” she cried. “I’ll tell you everything\r\nI know! You wish to learn what is this monstrous evil that threatens\r\nthe world with destruction—what you call anarchy and Bolshevism? It is\r\nan Evil that was born before Christ came! It is an Evil which not only\r\ndestroys cities and empires and men but which is more terrible still\r\nfor it obtains control of the human mind, and uses it at will; and it\r\nobtains sovereignty over the soul, and makes it prisoner. Its aim is to\r\ndominate first, then to destroy. It was conceived in the beginning by\r\nErlik and by Sorcerers and devils.... Always, from the first, there\r\nhave been sorcerers and living devils.\r\n\r\n“And when human history began to be remembered and chronicled, devils\r\nwere living who worshiped Erlik and practised sorcery.\r\n\r\n“They have been called by many names. A thousand years before Christ\r\nHassan Sabbah founded his sect called Hassanis or Assassins. The\r\nYezidees are of them. Their Chief is still called Sabbah; their creed\r\nis the annihilation of civilisation!”\r\n\r\nCleves had risen. The girl spoke in a clear, accentless monotone, not\r\nlooking at him, her eyes and pistol centred on the motionless curtains.\r\n\r\n“Look out!” she cried sharply.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” he demanded. “Do you suppose anybody is hidden\r\nbehind that curtain in the passageway?”\r\n\r\n“If there is,” she replied in her excited but distinct voice, “here is\r\na tale to entertain him:\r\n\r\n“The Hassanis are a sect of assassins which has spread out of Asia all\r\nover the world, and they are determined upon the annihilation of\r\neverything and everybody in it except themselves!\r\n\r\n“In Germany is a branch of the sect. The hun is the lineal descendant\r\nof the ancient Yezidee; the gods of the hun are the old demons under\r\nother names; the desire and object of the hun is the same desire—to\r\nrule the minds and bodies and souls of men and use them to their own\r\npurposes!”\r\n\r\nShe lifted her pistol a little, came a pace forward:\r\n\r\n“Anarchist, Yezidee, Hassani, Boche, Bolshevik—all are the same—all are\r\nsecretly swarming in the hidden places for the same purpose!”\r\n\r\nThe girl’s blue eyes were aflame, now, and the pistol was lifting\r\nslowly in her hand to a deadly level.\r\n\r\n“Sanang!” she cried in a terrible voice.\r\n\r\n“Sanang!” she cried again in her terrifying young voice—“Toad! Tortoise\r\negg! Spittle of Erlik! May the Thirty Thousand Calamities overtake you!\r\nSheik-el-Djebel!—cowardly Khan whom I laughed at from the temple when\r\nit rained yellow snakes on the marble steps when all the gongs in Yian\r\nsounded in your frightened ears!”\r\n\r\nShe waited.\r\n\r\n“What! You won’t step out? _Tokhta!_” she exclaimed in a ringing tone,\r\nand made a swift motion with her left hand. Apparently out of her empty\r\nopen palm, like a missile hurled, a thin, blinding beam of light struck\r\nthe curtains, making them suddenly transparent.\r\n\r\n_A man stood there._\r\n\r\nHe came out, moving very slowly as though partly stupefied. He wore\r\nevening dress under his overcoat, and had a long knife in his right\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nNobody spoke.\r\n\r\n“So—I really was to die then, if I came here,” said the girl in a\r\nwondering way.\r\n\r\nSanang’s stealthy gaze rested on her, stole toward Cleves. He moistened\r\nhis lips with his tongue. “You deliver me to this government agent?” he\r\nasked hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“I deliver nobody by treachery. You may go, Sanang.”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, a graceful, faultless, metropolitan figure in top-hat and\r\nevening attire. Then, as he started to move, Cleves covered him with\r\nhis weapon.\r\n\r\n“I can’t let that man go free!” cried Cleves angrily.\r\n\r\n“Very well!” she retorted in a passionate voice—“then take him if you\r\nare able! _Tokhta!_ Look out for yourself!”\r\n\r\nSomething swift as lightning struck the pistol from his grasp,—blinded\r\nhim, half stunned him, set him reeling in a drenching blaze of light\r\nthat blotted out all else.\r\n\r\nHe heard the door slam; he stumbled, caught at the back of a chair\r\nwhile his senses and sight were clearing.\r\n\r\n“By heavens!” he whispered with ashen lips, “you—you _are_ a\r\nsorceress—or something. What—what, are you doing to me?”\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. And when his vision cleared a little more he saw\r\nher crouched on the floor, her head against the locked door, listening,\r\nperhaps—or sobbing—he scarcely understood which until the quiver of her\r\nshoulders made it plainer.\r\n\r\nWhen at last Cleves went to her and bent over and touched her she\r\nlooked up at him out of wet eyes, and her grief-drawn mouth quivered.\r\n\r\n“I—I don’t know,” she sobbed, “if he truly stole away my\r\nsoul—there—there in the temple dusk of Yian. But he—he stole my\r\nheart—for all his wickedness—Sanang, Prince of the Yezidees—and I have\r\nbeen fighting him for it all these years—all these long years—fighting\r\nfor what he stole in the temple dusk!... And now—now I have it back—my\r\nheart—all broken to pieces—here on the floor behind your—your bolted\r\ndoor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE ASSASSINS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the wall hung a map of Mongolia, that indefinite region a million\r\nand a half square miles in area, vast sections of which have never been\r\nexplored.\r\n\r\nTurkestan and China border it on the south, and Tibet almost touches\r\nit, not quite.\r\n\r\nEven in the twelfth century, when the wild Mongols broke loose and\r\nnearly overran the world, the Tibet infantry under Genghis, the\r\nTchortcha horsemen drafted out of Black China, and a great cloud of\r\nMongol cavalry under the Prince of the Vanguard commanding half a\r\nhundred Hezars, never penetrated that grisly and unknown waste. The\r\n“Eight Towers of the Assassins” guarded it—still guard it, possibly.\r\n\r\nThe vice-regent of Erlik, Prince of Darkness, dwelt within this unknown\r\nland. And dwells there still, perhaps.\r\n\r\nIn front of this wall-map stood Tressa Norne.\r\n\r\nBehind her, facing the map, four men were seated—three of them under\r\nthirty.\r\n\r\nThese three were volunteers in the service of the United States\r\nGovernment—men of independent means, of position, who had volunteered\r\nfor military duty at the outbreak of the great war. However, they had\r\nbeen assigned by the Government to a very different sort of duty no\r\nless exciting than service on the fighting line, but far less\r\nconspicuous, for they had been drafted into the United States\r\nDepartment of Justice.\r\n\r\nThe names of these three were Victor Cleves, a professor of ornithology\r\nat Harvard University before the war; Alexander Selden, junior partner\r\nin the banking firm of Milwyn, Selden, and Co., and James Benton, a New\r\nYork architect.\r\n\r\nThe fourth man’s name was John Recklow. He might have been over fifty,\r\nor under. He was well-built, in a square, athletic way, clear-skinned\r\nand ruddy, grey-eyed, quiet in voice and manner. His hair and moustache\r\nhad turned silvery. He had been employed by the Government for many\r\nyears. He seemed to be enormously interested in what Miss Norne was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\nAlso he was the only man who interrupted her narrative to ask\r\nquestions. And his questions revealed a knowledge which was making the\r\ngirl more sensitive and uneasy every moment.\r\n\r\nFinally, when she spoke of the Scarlet Desert, he asked if the Scarlet\r\nLake were there and if the Xin was still supposed to inhabit its\r\nvermilion depths. And at that she turned and looked at him, her\r\nforefinger still resting on the map.\r\n\r\n“Where have you ever heard of the Scarlet Lake and the Xin?” she asked\r\nas though frightened.\r\n\r\nRecklow said quietly that as a boy he had served under Gordon and Sir\r\nRobert.\r\n\r\n“If, as a boy, you served under Chinese Gordon, you already know much\r\nof what I have told you, Mr. Recklow. Is it not true?” she demanded\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n“That makes no difference,” he replied with a smile. “It is all very\r\nnew to these three young gentlemen. And as for myself, I am checking up\r\nwhat you say and comparing it with what I heard many, many years ago\r\nwhen my comrade Barres and I were in Yian.”\r\n\r\n“Did you really know Sir Robert Hart?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then why do you not explain to these gentlemen?”\r\n\r\n“Dear child,” he interrupted gently, “what did Chinese Gordon or Sir\r\nRobert Hart, or even my comrade Barres, or I myself know about occult\r\nAsia in comparison to what you know?—a girl who has actually served the\r\nmysteries of Erlik for four amazing years!”\r\n\r\nShe paled a trifle, came slowly across the room to where Recklow was\r\nseated, laid a timid hand on his sleeve.\r\n\r\n“Do you believe there are sorcerers in Asia?” she asked with that\r\nchild-like directness which her wonderful blue eyes corroborated.\r\n\r\nRecklow remained silent.\r\n\r\n“Because,” she went on, “if, in your heart, you do not believe this to\r\nbe an accursed fact, then what I have to say will mean nothing to any\r\nof you.”\r\n\r\nRecklow touched his short, silvery moustache, hesitating. Then:\r\n\r\n“The worship of Erlik is devil worship,” he said. “Also I am entirely\r\nprepared to believe that there are, among the Yezidees, adepts who\r\nemploy scientific weapons against civilisation—who have probably\r\nobtained a rather terrifying knowledge of psychic laws which they use\r\nscientifically, and which to ordinary, God-fearing folk appear to be\r\nthe black magic of sorcerers.”\r\n\r\nCleves said: “The employment by the huns of poison gases and long-range\r\ncannon is a parallel case. Before the war we could not believe in the\r\npossibility of a cannon that threw shells a distance of seventy miles.”\r\n\r\nThe girl still addressed herself to Recklow: “Then you do not believe\r\nthere are real sorcerers in Asia, Mr. Recklow?”\r\n\r\n“Not sorcerers with supernatural powers for evil. Only degenerate human\r\nbeings who, somehow, have managed to tap invisible psychic currents,\r\nand have learned how to use terrific forces about which, so far, we\r\nknow practically nothing.”\r\n\r\nShe spoke again in the same uneasy voice: “Then you do not believe that\r\neither God or Satan is involved?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied smilingly, “and you must not so believe.”\r\n\r\n“Nor the—the destruction of human souls,” she persisted; “you do not\r\nbelieve it is being accomplished to-day?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the slightest, dear young lady,” he said cheerfully.\r\n\r\n“Do you not believe that to have been instructed in such unlawful\r\nknowledge is damning? Do you not believe that ability to employ unknown\r\nforces is forbidden of God, and that to disobey His law means death to\r\nthe soul?”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“That it is the price one pays to Satan for occult power over people’s\r\nminds?” she insisted.\r\n\r\n“Hypnotic suggestion is not one of the cardinal sins,” explained\r\nRecklow, still smiling—“unless wickedly employed. The Yezidee\r\npriesthood is a band of so-called sorcerers only because of their\r\nwicked employment of whatever hypnotic and psychic knowledge they may\r\nhave obtained.\r\n\r\n“There was nothing intrinsically wicked in the huns’ discovery of\r\nphosgene. But the use they made of it made devils out of them. My\r\nability to manufacture phosgene gas is no crime. But if I manufacture\r\nit and use it to poison innocent human beings, then, in that sense, I\r\nam, perhaps, a sort of modern sorcerer.”\r\n\r\nTressa Norne turned paler:\r\n\r\n“I had better tell you that I _have_ used—forbidden knowledge—which the\r\nYezidees taught me in the temple of Erlik.”\r\n\r\n“Used it how?” demanded Cleves.\r\n\r\n“To—to earn a living.... And once or twice to defend myself.”\r\n\r\nThere was the slightest scepticism in Recklow’s bland smile. “You did\r\nquite right, Miss Norne.”\r\n\r\nShe had become very white now. She stood beside Recklow, her back\r\ntoward the suspended map, and looked in a scared sort of way from one\r\nto the other of the men seated before her, turning finally to Cleves,\r\nand coming toward him.\r\n\r\n“I—I once killed a man,” she said with a catch in her breath.\r\n\r\nCleves reddened with astonishment. “Why did you do that?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“He was already on his way to kill me in bed.”\r\n\r\n“You were perfectly right,” remarked Recklow coolly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know ... I was in bed.... And then, on the edge of sleep, I\r\nfelt his mind groping to get hold of mine—feeling about in the darkness\r\nto get hold of my brain and seize it and paralyse it.”\r\n\r\nAll colour had left her face. Cleves gripped the arm of his chair and\r\nwatched her intently.\r\n\r\n“I—I had only a moment’s mental freedom,” she went on in a ghost of a\r\nvoice. “I was just able to rouse myself, fight off those murderous\r\nbrain-fingers—let loose a clear mental ray.... And then, O God! I saw\r\nhim in his room with his Kalmuck knife—saw him already on his way to\r\nmurder me—Gutchlug Khan, the Yezidee—looking about in his bedroom for a\r\nshroud.... And when—when he reached for the bed to draw forth a fine,\r\nwhite sheet for the shroud without which no Yezidee dares journey\r\ndeathward—then—_then_ I became frightened.... And I killed him—I slew\r\nhim there in his hotel bedroom on the floor above mine!”\r\n\r\nSelden moistened his lips: “That Oriental, Gutchlug, died from\r\nheart-failure in a San Francisco hotel,” he said. “I was there at the\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“He died by the fangs of a little yellow snake,” whispered the girl.\r\n\r\n“There was no snake in his room,” retorted Cleves.\r\n\r\n“And no wound on his body,” added Selden. “I attended the autopsy.”\r\n\r\nShe said, faintly: “There was no snake, and no wound, as you say....\r\nYet Gutchlug died of both there in his bedroom.... And before he died\r\nhe heard his soul bidding him farewell; and he saw the death-adder\r\ncoiled in the sheet he clutched—saw the thing strike him again and\r\nagain—saw and felt the tiny wounds on his left hand; felt the fangs\r\npricking deep, deep into the veins; died of it there within the\r\nminute—died of the swiftest poison known. And yet——”\r\n\r\nShe turned her dead-white face to Cleves—“And yet _there was no snake\r\nthere_!... And never had been.... And so I—I ask you, gentlemen, if\r\nsouls do not die when minds learn to fight death with death—and deal it\r\nso swiftly, so silently, while one’s body lies, unstirring on a bed—in\r\na locked room on the floor below——”\r\n\r\nShe swayed a little, put out one hand rather blindly.\r\n\r\nRecklow rose and passed a muscular arm around her; Cleves, beside her,\r\nheld her left hand, crushing it, without intention, until she opened\r\nher eyes with a cry of pain.\r\n\r\n“Are you all right?” asked Recklow bluntly.\r\n\r\n“Yes.” She turned and looked at Cleves and he caressed her bruised hand\r\nas though dazed.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” she said to Cleves—“you who know—know more about my mind\r\nthan anybody living——” a painful colour surged into her face—but she\r\nwent on steadily, forcing herself to meet his gaze: “tell me, Mr.\r\nCleves—do you still believe that nothing can really destroy my soul?\r\nAnd that it shall yet win through to safety?”\r\n\r\nHe said: “Your soul is in God’s keeping, and always shall be.... And if\r\nthe Yezidees have made you believe otherwise, they lie.”\r\n\r\nRecklow added in a slow, perplexed way: “I have no personal knowledge\r\nof psychic power. I am not psychic, not susceptible. But if you\r\nactually possess such ability, Miss Norne, and if you have employed\r\nsuch knowledge to defend your life, then you have done absolutely\r\nright.”\r\n\r\n“No guilt touches you,” added Selden with an involuntary shiver, “if by\r\nhypnosis or psychic ability you really did put an end to that would-be\r\nmurderer, Gutchlug.”\r\n\r\nSelden said: “If Gutchlug died by the fangs of a yellow death-adder\r\nwhich existed only in his own mind, and if you actually had anything to\r\ndo with it you acted purely in self-defence.”\r\n\r\n“You did your full duty,” added Benton—“but—good God!—it seems\r\nincredible to me, that such power can actually be available in the\r\nworld!”\r\n\r\nRecklow spoke again in his pleasant, undisturbed voice: “Go back to the\r\nmap, Miss Norne, and tell us a little more about this rather terrifying\r\nthing which you believe menaces the civilised world with destruction.”\r\n\r\nTressa Norne laid a slim finger on the map. Her voice had become\r\nsteady. She said:\r\n\r\n“The devil-worship, of which one of the modern developments is\r\nBolshevism, and another the terrorism of the hun, began in Asia long\r\nbefore Christ’s advent: At least so it was taught us in the temple of\r\nErlik.\r\n\r\n“It has always existed, its aim always has been the annihilation of\r\ngood and the elevation of evil; the subjection of right by might, and\r\nthe worldwide triumph of wrong.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it is as old as the first battle between God and Satan. I have\r\nwondered about it, sometimes. There in the dusk of the temple when the\r\nEight Assassins came—the eight Sheiks-el-Djebel, all in white—chanting\r\nthe Yakase of Sabbah—always that dirge when they came and spread their\r\neight white shrouds on the temple steps——”\r\n\r\nHer voice caught; she waited to recover her composure. Then went on:\r\n\r\n“The ambition of Genghis was to conquer the world by force of arms. It\r\nwas merely of physical subjection that he dreamed. But the Slayer of\r\nSouls——”\r\n\r\n“Who?” asked Recklow sharply.\r\n\r\n“The Slayer of Souls—Erlik’s vice-regent on earth—Hassan Sabbah. The\r\nOld Man of the Mountain. It is of him I am speaking,” exclaimed Tressa\r\nNorne—with quiet resolution. “Genghis sought only physical conquest of\r\nman; the Yezidee’s ambition is more awful, _for he is attempting to\r\nsurprise and seize the very minds of men_!”\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence. Tressa looked palely upon the four.\r\n\r\n“The Yezidees—who you tell me are not sorcerers—are using power—which\r\nyou tell me is not magic accursed by God—to waylay, capture, enslave,\r\nand destroy _the minds and souls of mankind_.\r\n\r\n“It may be that what they employ is hypnotic ability and psychic power\r\nand can be, some day, explained on a scientific basis when we learn\r\nmore about the occult laws which govern these phenomena.\r\n\r\n“But could anything render the threat less awful? For there have\r\nexisted for centuries—perhaps always—a sect of Satanists determined\r\nupon the destruction of everything that is pure and holy and good on\r\nearth; and they are resolved to substitute for righteousness the\r\ndreadful reign of hell.\r\n\r\n“In the beginning there were comparatively few of these human demons.\r\nGradually, through the eras, they have increased. In the twelfth\r\ncentury there were fifty thousand of the Sect of Assassins.\r\n\r\n“Beside the castle of the Slayer of Souls on Mount Alamout——” she laid\r\nher finger on the map—“eight other towers were erected for the Eight\r\nChief Assassins, called Sheiks-el-Djebel.\r\n\r\n“In the temple we were taught where these eight towers stood.” She\r\npicked up a pencil, and on eight blank spaces of unexplored and\r\nunmapped Mongolia she made eight crosses. Then she turned to the men\r\nbehind her.\r\n\r\n“It was taught to us in the temple that from these eight _foci_ of\r\ninfection the disease of evil has been spreading throughout the world;\r\nfrom these eight towers have gone forth every year the emissaries of\r\nevil—perverted missionaries—to spread the poisonous propaganda, to\r\nteach it, to tamper stealthily with the minds of men, dominate them,\r\npervert them, instruct them in the creed of the Assassin of Souls.\r\n\r\n“All over the world are people, already contaminated, whose minds are\r\nalready enslaved and poisoned, and who are infecting the still healthy\r\nbrains of others—stealthily possessing themselves of the minds of\r\nmankind—teaching them evil, inviting them to mock the precepts of\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\n“Of such lost minds are the degraded brains of the Germans—the pastors\r\nand philosophers who teach that might is right.\r\n\r\n“Of such crippled minds are the Bolsheviki, poisoned long, long ago by\r\nclose contact with Asia which, before that, had infected and enslaved\r\nthe minds of the ruling classes with ferocious philosophy.\r\n\r\n“Of such minds are all anarchists of every shade and stripe—all\r\nterrorists, all disciples of violence,—the murderously envious, the\r\nslothful slinking brotherhood which prowls through the world taking\r\nevery opportunity to set it afire; those mentally dulled by reason of\r\nexcesses; those weak intellects become unsound through futile\r\ngabble,—parlour socialists, amateur revolutionists, theoretical\r\nincapables excited by discussion fit only for healthy minds.”\r\n\r\nShe left the map and came over to where the four men were seated\r\nterribly intent upon her every word.\r\n\r\n“In the temple of Erlik, where my girlhood was passed after the murder\r\nof my parents, I learned what I am repeating to you,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I learned this, also, that the Eight Towers still exist—still stand\r\nto-day,—at least theoretically—and that from the Eight Towers pours\r\nforth across the world a stream of poison.\r\n\r\n“I was told that, to every country, eight Yezidees were allotted—eight\r\nsorcerers—or adepts in scientific psychology if you prefer it—whose\r\nmission is to teach the gospel of hell and gradually but surely to win\r\nthe minds of men to the service of the Slayer of Souls.\r\n\r\n“That is what was taught us in the temple. We were educated in the\r\ndevelopment of occult powers—for it seems all human beings possess this\r\npsychic power latent within them—only few, even when instructed,\r\nacquire any ability to control and use this force....\r\n\r\n“I—I learned—rapidly. I even thought, sometimes, that the Yezidees were\r\nbeginning to be a little afraid of me,—even the Hassani priests.... And\r\nthe Sheiks-el-Djebel, spreading their shrouds on the temple steps,\r\nlooked at me with unquiet eyes, where I stood like a corpse amid the\r\nincense clouds——”\r\n\r\nShe passed her fingers over her eyelids, then framed her face between\r\nboth hands for a moment’s thought lost in tragic retrospection.\r\n\r\n“Kai!” she whispered dreamily as though to herself—“what Erlik awoke\r\nwithin my body that was asleep, God knows, but it was as though a twin\r\ncomrade arose within me and looked out through my eyes upon a world\r\nwhich never before had been visible.”\r\n\r\nUtter silence reigned in the room: Cleves’s breathing seemed almost\r\npainful to him so intently was he listening and watching this girl;\r\nBenton’s hands whitened with his grip on the chair-arms; Selden, tense,\r\nabsorbed, kept his keen gaze of a business man fastened on her face.\r\nRecklow slowly caressed the cold bowl of his pipe with both thumbs.\r\n\r\nTressa Norne’s strange and remote eyes subtly altered, and she lifted\r\nher head and looked calmly at the men before her.\r\n\r\n“I think that there is nothing more for me to add,” she said. “The Red\r\nSpectre of Anarchy, called Bolshevism at present, threatens our\r\ncountry. Our Government is now awake to this menace and the Secret\r\nService is moving everywhere.\r\n\r\n“Great damage already has been done to the minds of many people in this\r\nRepublic; poison has spread; is spreading. The Eight Towers still\r\nstand. The Eight Assassins are in America.\r\n\r\n“But these eight Assassins know me to be their enemy.... They will\r\nsurely attempt to kill me.... I don’t believe I can avoid—death—very\r\nlong.... But I want to serve my country and—and mankind.”\r\n\r\n“They’ll have to get me first,” said Cleves, bluntly. “I shall not\r\npermit you out of my sight.”\r\n\r\nRecklow said in a musing voice: “And these eight gentlemen, who are\r\nvery likely to hurt us, also, are the first people we ought to hunt.”\r\n\r\n“To get them,” added Selden, “we ought to choke the stream at its\r\nsource.”\r\n\r\n“To find out who they are is what is going to worry us,” added Benton.\r\nCleves had stood holding a chair for Tressa Norne. Finally she noticed\r\nit and seated herself as though tired.\r\n\r\n“Is Sanang one of these eight?” he asked her. The girl turned and\r\nlooked up at him, and he saw the flush mounting in her face.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes,” she said steadily, “I have almost believed he was Erlik’s\r\nown vice-regent on earth—the Slayer of Souls himself.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBenton and Selden had gone. Recklow left a little later. Cleves\r\naccompanied him out to the landing.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to keep Miss Norne here with you for the present?”\r\ninquired the older man.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I dare not let her out of my sight, Recklow. What else can I do?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Is she prepared for the consequences?”\r\n\r\n“Gossip? Slander?”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“I can get a housekeeper.”\r\n\r\n“That only makes it look worse.”\r\n\r\nCleves reddened. “Well, do you want to find her in some hotel or\r\napartment with her throat cut?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Recklow, gently, “I do not.”\r\n\r\n“Then what else is there to do but keep her here in my own apartment\r\nand never let her out of my sight until we can find and lock up the\r\neight gentlemen who are undoubtedly bent on murdering her?”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t there some woman in the Service who could help out? I could\r\nmention several.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you I can’t trust Tressa Norne to anybody except myself,”\r\ninsisted Cleves. “I got her into this; I am responsible if she is\r\nmurdered; I dare not entrust her safety to anybody else. And, Recklow,\r\nit’s a ghastly responsibility for a man to induce a young girl to face\r\ndeath, even in the service of her country.”\r\n\r\n“If she remains here alone with you she’ll face social destruction,”\r\nremarked Recklow.\r\n\r\nCleves was silent for a moment, then he burst out: “Well, what am I to\r\ndo? What is there left for me to do except to watch over her and see\r\nher through this devilish business? What other way have I to protect\r\nher, Recklow?”\r\n\r\n“You could offer her the protection of your name,” suggested the other,\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n“What? You mean—marry her?”\r\n\r\n“Well, nobody else would be inclined to, Cleves, if it ever becomes\r\nknown she has lived here quite alone with you.”\r\n\r\nCleves stared at the elder man.\r\n\r\n“This is nonsense,” he said in a harsh voice. “That young girl doesn’t\r\nwant to marry anybody. Neither do I. She doesn’t wish to have her\r\nthroat cut, that’s all. And I’m determined she shan’t.”\r\n\r\n“There are stealthier assassins, Cleves,—the slayers of reputations. It\r\ngoes badly with their victim. It does indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Well, hang it, what do you think I ought to do?”\r\n\r\n“I think you ought to marry her if you’re going to keep her here.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose she doesn’t mind the unconventionality of it?”\r\n\r\n“All women mind. No woman, at heart, is unconventional, Cleves.”\r\n\r\n“She—she seems to agree with me that she ought to stay here....\r\nBesides, she has no money, no relatives, no friends in America——”\r\n\r\n“All the more tragic. If you really believe it to be your duty to keep\r\nher here where you can look after her bodily safety, then the other\r\nobligation is still heavier. And there may come a day when Miss Norne\r\nwill wish that you had been less conscientious concerning the safety of\r\nher pretty throat.... For the knife of the Yezidee is swifter and less\r\ncruel than the tongue that slays with a smile.... And this young girl\r\nhas many years to live, after this business of Bolshevism is dead and\r\nforgotten in our Republic.”\r\n\r\n“Recklow!”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“You think I might dare try to find a room somewhere else for her and\r\nlet her take her chances? _Do_ you?”\r\n\r\n“It’s your affair.”\r\n\r\n“I know—hang it! I know it’s my affair. I’ve unintentionally made it\r\nso. But can’t you tell me what I ought to do?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t.”\r\n\r\n“What would _you_ do?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t ask me,” returned Recklow, sharply. “If you’re not man enough to\r\ncome to a decision you may turn her over to me.”\r\n\r\nCleves flushed brightly. “Do you think _you_ are old enough to take my\r\njob and avoid scandal?”\r\n\r\nRecklow’s cold eyes rested on him: “If you like,” he said, “I’ll assume\r\nyour various kinds of personal responsibility toward Miss Norne.”\r\n\r\nCleve’s visage burned. “I’ll shoulder my own burdens,” he retorted.\r\n\r\n“Sure. I knew you would.” And Recklow smiled and held out his hand.\r\nCleves took it without cordiality. Standing so, Recklow, still smiling,\r\nsaid: “What a rotten deal that child has had—is having. Her father and\r\nmother were fine people. Did you ever hear of Dr. Norne?”\r\n\r\n“She mentioned him once.”\r\n\r\n“They were up-State people of most excellent antecedents and no money.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Norne was our Vice-Consul at Yarkand in the province of Sin Kiang.\r\nAll he had was his salary, and he lost that and his post when the\r\nadministration changed. Then he went into the spice trade.\r\n\r\n“Some Jew syndicate here sent him up the Yarkand River to see what\r\ncould be done about jade and gold concessions. He was on that business\r\nwhen the tragedy happened. The Kalmuks and Khirghiz were responsible,\r\nunder Yezidee instigation. And there you are:—and here is his child,\r\nCleves—back, by some miracle, from that flowering hell called Yian,\r\nbelieving in her heart that she really lost her soul there in the\r\ntemple. And now, here in her own native land, she is exposed to actual\r\nand hourly danger of assassination.... Poor kid!... Did you ever hear\r\nof a rottener deal, Cleves?”\r\n\r\nTheir hands had remained clasped while Recklow was speaking. He spoke\r\nagain, clearly, amiably:\r\n\r\n“To lay down one’s life for a friend is fine. I’m not sure that it’s\r\nfiner to offer one’s honour in behalf of a girl whose honour is at\r\nstake.”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment Cleves’s grip tightened.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he said.\r\n\r\nRecklow went downstairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nIN BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nCleves went back into the apartment; he noticed that Miss Norne’s door\r\nwas ajar.\r\n\r\nTo get to his own room he had to pass that way; and he saw her, seated\r\nbefore the mirror, partly undressed, her dark, lustrous hair being\r\ncombed out and twisted up for the night.\r\n\r\nWhether this carelessness was born of innocence or of indifference\r\nmattered little; he suddenly realised that these conditions wouldn’t\r\ndo. And his first feeling was of anger.\r\n\r\n“If you’ll put on your robe and slippers,” he said in an unpleasant\r\nvoice, “I’d like to talk to you for a few moments.”\r\n\r\nShe turned her head on its charming neck and looked around and up at\r\nhim over one naked shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Shall I come into your room?” she inquired.\r\n\r\n“No!... when you’ve got some clothes on, call me.”\r\n\r\n“I’m quite ready now,” she said calmly, and drew the Chinese slippers\r\nover her bare feet and passed a silken loop over the silver bell\r\nbuttons on her right shoulder. Then, undisturbed, she continued to\r\ntwist up her hair, following his movements in the mirror with\r\nunconcerned blue eyes.\r\n\r\nHe entered and seated himself, the impatient expression still creasing\r\nhis forehead and altering his rather agreeable features.\r\n\r\n“Miss Norne,” he said, “you’re absolutely convinced that these people\r\nmean to do you harm. Isn’t that true?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” she said simply.\r\n\r\n“Then, until we get them, you’re running a serious risk. In fact, you\r\nlive in hourly peril. That is your belief, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\nShe put the last peg into her thick, curly hair, lowered her arms,\r\nturned, dropped one knee over the other, and let her candid gaze rest\r\non him in silence.\r\n\r\n“What I mean to explain,” he said coldly, “is that as long as I induced\r\nyou to go into this affair I’m responsible for you. If I let you out of\r\nmy sight here in New York and if anything happens to you, I’ll be as\r\nguilty as the dirty beast who takes your life. What is your opinion?\r\nIt’s up to me to stand by you now, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“I had rather be near you—for a while,” she said timidly.\r\n\r\n“Certainly. But, Miss Norne, our living here together, in my\r\napartment—or living together anywhere else—is never going to be\r\nunderstood by other people. You know that, don’t you?”\r\n\r\nAfter a silence, still looking at him out of clear unembarrassed eyes:\r\n\r\n“I know.... But ... I don’t want to die.”\r\n\r\n“I told you,” he said sharply, “they’ll have to kill me first. So\r\nthat’s all right. But how about what I am doing to your reputation?”\r\n\r\n“I understand.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you do. You’re very young. Once out of this blooming mess,\r\nyou will have all your life before you. But if I kill your reputation\r\nfor you while saving your body from death, you’ll find no happiness in\r\nliving. Do you realise that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then? Have you any solution for this problem that confronts\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you any idea to suggest?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t—don’t want to die,” she repeated in an unsteady voice.\r\n\r\nHe bit his lip; and after a moment’s scowling silence under the\r\nmerciless scrutiny of her eyes: “Then you had better marry me,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before she spoke. For a second or two he sustained the\r\nsearching quality of her gaze, but it became unendurable.\r\n\r\nPresently she said: “I don’t ask it of you. I can shoulder my own\r\nburdens.” And he remembered what he had just said to Recklow.\r\n\r\n“You’ve shouldered more than your share,” he blurted out. “You are\r\ndeliberately risking death to serve your country. I enlisted you. The\r\nleast I can do is to say my affections are not engaged; so naturally\r\nthe idea of—of marrying anybody never entered my head.”\r\n\r\n“Then you do not care for anybody else?”\r\n\r\nHer candour amazed and disconcerted him.\r\n\r\n“No.” He looked at her, curiously. “Do you care for anybody in that\r\nway?”\r\n\r\nA light blush tinted her face. She said gravely: “If we really are\r\ngoing to marry each other I had better tell you that I did care for\r\nPrince Sanang.”\r\n\r\n“What!” he cried, astounded.\r\n\r\n“It seems incredible, doesn’t it? Yet it is quite true. I fought him; I\r\nfought myself; I stood guard over my mind and senses there in the\r\ntemple; I knew what he was and I detested him and I mocked him there in\r\nthe temple.... And I loved him.”\r\n\r\n“Sanang!” he repeated, not only amazed but also oddly incensed at the\r\nnaïve confession.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sanang.... If we are to marry, I thought I ought to tell you.\r\nDon’t you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” he replied in an absent-minded way, his mind still\r\ngrasping at the thing. Then, looking up: “Do you still care for this\r\nfellow?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Are you perfectly sure, Miss Norne?”\r\n\r\n“As sure as that I am alive when I awake from a nightmare. My hatred\r\nfor Sanang is very bitter,” she added frankly, “and yet somehow it is\r\nnot my wish to see him harmed.”\r\n\r\n“You still care for him a little?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no. But—can’t you understand that it is not in me to wish him\r\nharm?... No girl feels that way—once having cared. To become\r\nindifferent to a familiar thing is perhaps natural; but to desire to\r\nharm it is not in my character.”\r\n\r\n“You have plenty of character,” he said, staring; at her.\r\n\r\n“You don’t think so. Do you?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because of what I said to you on the roof-garden that night. It was\r\nshameful, wasn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“You behaved like many a thoroughbred,” he returned bluntly; “you were\r\nscared, bewildered, ready to bolt to any shelter offered.”\r\n\r\n“It’s quite true I didn’t know what to do to keep alive. And that was\r\nall that interested me—to keep on living—having lost my soul and being\r\nafraid to die and find myself in hell with Erlik.”\r\n\r\nHe said: “Isn’t that absurd notion out of your head yet?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know ... I can’t suddenly believe myself safe after all those\r\nyears. It is not easy to root out what was planted in childhood and\r\nwhat grew to be part of one during the tender and formative period....\r\nYou can’t understand, Mr. Cleves—you can’t ever feel or visualise what\r\nbecame my daily life in a region which was half paradise and half\r\nhell——”\r\n\r\nShe bent her head and took her face between her fingers, and sat so,\r\nbrooding.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while: “Well,” he said, “there’s only one way to manage\r\nthis affair—if you are willing, Miss Norne.”\r\n\r\nShe merely lifted her eyes.\r\n\r\n“I think,” he said, “there’s only that one way out of it. But you\r\nunderstand”—he turned pink—“it will be quite all right—your\r\nliberty—privacy—I shan’t bother you—annoy——”\r\n\r\nShe merely looked at him.\r\n\r\n“After this Bolshevistic flurry is settled—in a year or two—or\r\nthree—then you can very easily get your freedom; and you’ll have all\r\nlife before you” ... he rose: “—and a jolly good friend in me—a good\r\ncomrade, Miss Norne. And that means you can count on me when you go\r\ninto business—or whatever you decide to do.”\r\n\r\nShe also had risen, standing slim and calm in her exquisite Chinese\r\nrobe, the sleeves of which covered her finger tips.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to marry me?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“If you’ll let me.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—I will ... it’s so generous and considerate of you. I—I don’t ask\r\nit; I really don’t——”\r\n\r\n“But _I_ do.”\r\n\r\n“—And I never dreamed of such a thing.”\r\n\r\nHe forced a smile. “Nor I. It’s rather a crazy thing to do. But I know\r\nof no saner alternative.... So we had better get our license\r\nto-morrow.... And that settles it.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to go; and, on her threshold, his feet caught in something on\r\nthe floor and he stumbled, trying to free his feet from a roll of soft\r\nwhite cloth lying there on the carpet. And when he picked it up, it\r\nunrolled, and a knife fell out of the folds of cloth and struck his\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nStill perplexed, not comprehending, he stooped to recover the knife.\r\nThen, straightening up, he found himself looking into the colourless\r\nface of Tressa Norne.\r\n\r\n“What’s all this?” he asked—“this sheet and knife here on the floor\r\noutside your door?”\r\n\r\nShe answered with difficulty: “They have sent you your shroud, I\r\nthink.”\r\n\r\n“Are not those things yours? Were they not already here in your\r\nbaggage?” he demanded incredulously. Then, realising that they had not\r\nbeen there on the door-sill when he entered her room a few moments\r\nsince, a rough chill passed over him—the icy caress of fear.\r\n\r\n“Where did that thing come from?” he said hoarsely. “How could it get\r\nhere when my door is locked and bolted? Unless there’s somebody hidden\r\nhere!”\r\n\r\nHot anger suddenly flooded him; he drew his pistol and sprang into the\r\npassageway.\r\n\r\n“What the devil is all this!” he repeated furiously, flinging open his\r\nbedroom door and switching on the light.\r\n\r\nHe searched his room in a rage, went on and searched the dining-room,\r\nsmoking-room, and kitchen, and every clothes-press and closet, always\r\naware of Tressa’s presence close behind him. And when there remained no\r\ntiniest nook or cranny in the place unsearched, he stood in the centre\r\nof the carpet glaring at the locked and bolted door.\r\n\r\nHe heard her say under her breath: “This is going to be a sleepless\r\nnight. And a dangerous one.” And, turning to stare at her, saw no fear\r\nin her face, only excitement.\r\n\r\nHe still held clutched in his left hand the sheet and the knife. Now he\r\nthrust these toward her.\r\n\r\n“What’s this damned foolery, anyway?” he demanded harshly. She took the\r\nknife with a slight shudder. “There is something engraved on the silver\r\nhilt,” she said.\r\n\r\nHe bent over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Eighur,” she added calmly, “not Arabic. The Mongols had no written\r\ncharacters of their own.”\r\n\r\nShe bent closer, studying the inscription. After a moment, still\r\nstudying the Eighur characters, she rested her left hand on his\r\nshoulder—an impulsive, unstudied movement that might have meant either\r\nconfidence or protection.\r\n\r\n“Look,” she said, “it is not addressed to you after all, but to a\r\nsymbol—a series of numbers, 53-6-26.”\r\n\r\n“That is my designation in the Federal Service,” he said, sharply.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she nodded slowly. “Then this is what is written in the\r\nMongol-Yezidee dialect, traced out in Eighur characters: ‘To 53-6-26!\r\nBy one of the Eight Assassins the Slayer of Souls sends this shroud and\r\nthis knife from Mount Alamout. Such a blade shall divide your heart.\r\nThis sheet is for your corpse.’”\r\n\r\nAfter a grim silence he flung the soft white cloth on the floor.\r\n\r\n“There’s no use my pretending I’m not surprised and worried,” he said;\r\n“I don’t know how that cloth got here. Do you?”\r\n\r\n“It was sent.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and gave him a grave, confused look.\r\n\r\n“There are ways. You could not understand.... This is going to be a\r\nsleepless night for us.”\r\n\r\n“You can go to bed, Tressa. I’ll sit up and read and keep an eye on\r\nthat door.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t let you remain alone here. I’m afraid to do that.”\r\n\r\nHe gave a laugh, not quite pleasant, as he suddenly comprehended that\r\nthe girl now considered their _rôles_ to be reversed.\r\n\r\n“Are _you_ planning to sit up in order to protect _me_?” he asked,\r\ngrimly amused.\r\n\r\n“Do you mind?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you blessed little thing, I can take care of myself. How funny of\r\nyou, when I am trying to plan how best to look out for _you_!”\r\n\r\nBut her face remained pale and concerned, and she rested her left hand\r\nmore firmly on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“I wish to remain awake with you,” she said. “Because I myself don’t\r\nfully understand this”—she looked at the knife in her palm, then down\r\nat the shroud. “It is going to be a strange night for us,” she sighed.\r\n“Let us sit together here on the lounge where I can face _that bolted\r\ndoor_. And if you are willing, I am going to turn out the lights——” She\r\nsuddenly bent forward and switched them off—“because I must keep my\r\nmind on guard.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you do that?” he asked, “you can’t see the door, now.”\r\n\r\n“Let me help you in my own way,” she whispered. “I—I am very deeply\r\ndisturbed, and very, very angry. I do not understand this new menace.\r\nYezidee that I am, I do not understand what kind of danger threatens\r\nyou through your loyalty to me.”\r\n\r\nShe drew him forward, and he opened his mouth to remonstrate, to laugh;\r\nbut as he turned, his foot touched the shroud, and an uncontrollable\r\nshiver passed over him.\r\n\r\nThey went close together, across the dim room to the lounge, and seated\r\nthemselves. Enough light from Madison Avenue made objects in the room\r\nbarely discernible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSounds from the street below became rarer as the hours wore away. The\r\niron jar of trams, the rattle of vehicles, the harsh warning of\r\ntaxicabs broke the stillness at longer and longer intervals, until,\r\nsave only for that immense and ceaseless vibration of the monstrous\r\niron city under the foggy stars, scarcely a sound stirred the silence.\r\n\r\nThe half-hour had struck long ago on the bell of the little clock. Now\r\nthe clear bell sounded three times.\r\n\r\nCleves stirred on the lounge beside Tressa. Again and again he had\r\nthought that she was asleep for her head had fallen back against the\r\ncushions, and she lay very still. But always, when he leaned nearer to\r\npeer down at her, he saw her eyes open, and fixed intently upon the\r\nbolted door.\r\n\r\nHis pistol, which still rested on his knee, was pointed across the\r\nroom, toward the door. Once he reminded her in a whisper that she was\r\nunarmed and that it might be as well for her to go and get her pistol.\r\nBut she murmured that she was sufficiently equipped; and, in spite of\r\nhimself, he shivered as he glanced down at her frail and empty hands.\r\n\r\nIt was some time between three and half-past, he judged, when a sudden\r\nmovement of the girl brought him upright on his seat, quivering with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Cleves!”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“The Sorcerers!”\r\n\r\n“Where? Outside the door?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my God,” she murmured, “_they are after my mind again_! Their\r\nfingers are groping to seize my brain and get possession of it!”\r\n\r\n“What!” he stammered, horrified.\r\n\r\n“Here—in the dark,” she whispered—“and I feel their fingers caressing\r\nme—searching—moving stealthily to surprise and grasp my thoughts.... I\r\nknow what they are doing.... I am resisting.... I am\r\nfighting—fighting!”\r\n\r\nShe sat bolt upright with clenched hands at her breast, her face palely\r\naglow in the dimness as though illumined by some vivid inward light—or,\r\nas he thought—from the azure blaze in her wide-open eyes.\r\n\r\n“Is—is this what you call—what you believe to be magic?” he asked\r\nunsteadily. “Is there some hostile psychic influence threatening you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I’m resisting. I’m fighting—fighting. They shall not trap me.\r\nThey shall not harm you!... I know how to defend myself and you!... And\r\n_you_!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly she flung her left arm around his neck and the delicate\r\nclenched hand brushed his cheek.\r\n\r\n“They shall not have you,” she breathed. “I am fighting. I am holding\r\nmy own. There are eight of them—eight Assassins! My mind is in battle\r\nwith theirs—fiercely in battle.... I hold my own! I am armed and\r\nwaiting!”\r\n\r\nWith a convulsive movement she drew his head closer to her shoulder.\r\n“Eight of them!” she whispered,—“trying to entrap and seize my brain.\r\nBut my thoughts are free! My mind is defending you—you, here in my\r\narms!”\r\n\r\nAfter a breathless silence: “Look out!” she whispered with terrible\r\nenergy; “they are after _your_ mind at last. Fix your thoughts on me!\r\nKeep your mind clear of their net! Don’t let their ghostly fingers\r\ntouch it. Look at me!” She drew him closer. “Look at _me_! Believe in\r\n_me_! I can resist. I can defend you. Does your head feel confused?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—numb.”\r\n\r\n“_Don’t sleep!_ Don’t close your eyes! Keep them open and look at me!”\r\n\r\n“I can scarcely see you——”\r\n\r\n“You _must_ see me!”\r\n\r\n“My eyes are heavy,” he said drowsily. “I can’t see you, Tressa——”\r\n\r\n“Wake! Look at me! Keep your mind clear. Oh, I beg you—I beg you!\r\nThey’re after our minds and souls, I tell you! Oh, believe in me,” she\r\nbeseeched him in an agonised whisper—“Can’t you believe in me for a\r\nmoment,—as if you loved me!”\r\n\r\nHis heavy lids lifted and he tried to look at her.\r\n\r\n“Can you see me? _Can_ you?”\r\n\r\nHe muttered something in a confused voice.\r\n\r\n“Victor!”\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his own name, he opened his eyes again and tried to\r\nstraighten up, but his pistol fell to the carpet.\r\n\r\n“Victor!” she gasped, “clear your mind in the name of God!”\r\n\r\n“I can not——”\r\n\r\n“I tell you hell is opening beyond that door!—outside your bolted door,\r\nthere! Can’t you believe me! Can’t you hear me! Oh, what will hold you\r\nif the love of God can not!” she burst out. “I’d crucify myself for you\r\nif you’d look at me—if you’d only fight hard enough to believe in me—as\r\nthough you loved me!”\r\n\r\nHis eyes unclosed but he sank back against her shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Victor!” she cried in a terrible voice.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\n“If the love of God could only hold you for a moment more!”—she\r\nstammered with her mouth against his ear, “just for a moment, Victor!\r\nCan’t you hear me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—very far away.”\r\n\r\n“Fight for me! Try to care for me! Don’t let Sanang have me!”\r\n\r\nHe shuddered in her arms, reached out and resting heavily on her\r\nshoulder, staggered to his feet and stood swaying like a drunken man.\r\n\r\n“No, by God,” he said thickly, “Sanang shall not touch you.”\r\n\r\nThe girl was on her feet now, holding him upright with an arm around\r\nhis shoulders.\r\n\r\n“They can’t—can’t harm us together,” she stammered. “Hark! Listen! Can\r\nyou hear? Oh, can you hear?”\r\n\r\n“Give me my pistol,” he tried to say, but his tongue seemed twisted.\r\n“No—by God—Sanang shall not touch you.”\r\n\r\nShe stooped lithely and recovered the weapon. “Hush,” she said close to\r\nhis burning face. “Listen. Our minds are safe! I can hear somebody’s\r\nsoul bidding its body farewell!”\r\n\r\nWhite-lipped she burst out laughing, kicked the shroud out of the way,\r\nthrust the pistol into his right hand, went forward, forcing him along\r\nbeside her, and drew the bolts from the door.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he spoke distinctly:\r\n\r\n“Is there anything outside that door on the landing?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.... I don’t know what. Are you ready?” She laid her hand on lock\r\nand knob.\r\n\r\nHe nodded. At the same instant she jerked open the door; and a\r\nhunchback who had been picking at the lock fell headlong into the room,\r\nhis pistol exploding on the carpet in a streak of fire.\r\n\r\nIt was a horrible struggle to secure the powerful misshapen creature,\r\nfor he clawed and squealed and bounced about on the floor, striking\r\nblindly with ape-like arms. But at last Cleves held him down, throttled\r\nand twitching, and Tressa ripped strips from the shroud to truss up the\r\nwrithing thing.\r\n\r\nThen Cleves switched on the light.\r\n\r\n“Why—why—you rat!” he exclaimed in hysterical relief at seeing a living\r\nman whom he recognised there at his feet. “What are you doing here?”\r\n\r\nThe hunchback’s red eyes blazed up at him from the floor.\r\n\r\n“Who—who is he?” faltered the girl.\r\n\r\n“He’s a German tailor named Albert Feke—one of the Chicago\r\nBolsheviki—the most dangerous sort we harbour—one of their vile leaders\r\nwho preaches that might is right and tells his disciples to go ahead\r\nand take what they want.”\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the malignant cripple.\r\n\r\n“You’re wanted for the I. W. W. bomb murder, Albert. Did you know it?”\r\n\r\nThe hunchback licked his bloody lips. Then he kicked himself to a\r\nsitting position, squatted there like a toad and looked steadily at\r\nTressa Norne out of small red-rimmed eyes. Blood dripped on his beard;\r\nhis huge hairy fists, tied and crossed behind his back, made odd,\r\nspasmodic movements.\r\n\r\nCleves went to the telephone. Presently Tressa heard his voice, calm\r\nand distinct as usual:\r\n\r\n“We’ve caught Albert Feke. He’s here at my rooms. I’d like to have you\r\ncome over, Recklow.... Oh, yes, he kicked and scuffled and scratched\r\nlike a cat.... What?... No, I hadn’t heard that he’d been in China....\r\nWho?... Albert Feke? You say he was one of the Germans who escaped from\r\nShantung four years ago?... You think he’s a Yezidee! You mean one of\r\nthe Eight Assassins?”\r\n\r\nThe hunchback, staring at Tressa out of red-rimmed eyes, suddenly\r\nsnarled and lurched his misshapen body at her.\r\n\r\n“Teufelstuck!” he screamed, “ain’t I tell efferybody in Yian already it\r\niss safer if we cut your throat! Devil-slut of\r\nErlik—snow-leopardess!—cat of the Yezidees who has made of Sanang a\r\nfool!—it iss I who haf said always, always, that you know too damn\r\nmuch!... Kai!... I hear my soul bidding me farewell. Gif me my shroud!”\r\n\r\nCleves came back from the telephone. With the toe of his left foot he\r\nlifted the shroud and kicked it across the hunchback’s knees.\r\n\r\n“So you were one of the huns who instigated the massacre in Yian,” he\r\nsaid, curiously. At that Tressa turned very white and a cry escaped\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut the hunchback’s features were all twisted into ferocious laughter,\r\nand he beat on the carpet with the heels of his great splay feet.\r\n\r\n“Ja! Ja!” he shrieked, “in Yian it vas a goot hunting! English and\r\nYankee men und vimmens ve haff dropped into dose deep wells down. Py\r\nGott in Himmel, how dey schream up out of dose deep wells in Yian!” He\r\nbegan to cackle and shriek in his frenzy. “Ach Gott ja! It iss not you\r\neither—you there, Keuke Mongol, who shall escape from the\r\nSheiks-el-Djebel! It iss dot Old Man of the Mountain who shall tell\r\nyour soul it iss time to say farewell! Ja! Ja! Ach Gott!—it iss my only\r\nregret that I shall not see the world when it is all afire! Ja! Ja!—all\r\non fire like hell! But you shall see it, slut-leopard of the snows! You\r\nshall see it und you shall burn! Kai! Kai! My soul it iss bidding my\r\nbody farewell. Kai! May Erlik curse you, Keuke Mongol—Heavenly\r\nAzure—Sorceress of the temple!—”\r\n\r\nHe spat at her and rolled over in his shroud.\r\n\r\nThe girl looking down on him closed her eyes for a moment, and Cleves\r\nsaw her bloodless lips move, and bent nearer, listening. And he heard\r\nher whispering to herself:\r\n\r\n“Preserve us all, O God, from the wrath of Satan who was stoned.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nTHE BRIDAL\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the United States stretched an unseen network of secret intrigue\r\nwoven tirelessly night and day by the busy enemies of\r\ncivilisation—Reds, parlour-socialists, enemy-aliens, terrorists,\r\nBolsheviki, pseudo-intellectuals, I. W. W.’s, social faddists, and\r\namateur meddlers of every nuance—all the various varieties of the\r\nvicious, witless, and mentally unhinged—brought together through the\r\n“cohesive power of plunder” and the degeneration of cranial tissue.\r\n\r\nAll over the United States the various departmental divisions of the\r\nSecret Service were busily following up these threads of intrigue\r\nleading everywhere through the obscurity of this vast and secret maze.\r\n\r\nTo meet the constantly increasing danger of physical violence and to\r\nuncover secret plots threatening sabotage and revolution, there were\r\ncapable agents in every branch of the Secret Service, both Federal and\r\nState.\r\n\r\nBut in the first months of 1919 something more terrifying than physical\r\nviolence suddenly threatened civilised America,—a wild, grotesque,\r\nincredible threat of a _war on human minds_!\r\n\r\nAnd, little by little, the United States Government became convinced\r\nthat this ghastly menace was no dream of a disordered imagination, but\r\nthat it was real: that among the enemies of civilisation there actually\r\nexisted a few powerful but perverted minds capable of wielding psychic\r\nforces as terrific weapons: that by the sinister use of psychic\r\nknowledge controlling these mighty forces the very minds of mankind\r\ncould be stealthily approached, seized, controlled and turned upon\r\ncivilisation to aid in the world’s destruction.\r\n\r\nIn terrible alarm the Government turned to England for advice. But Sir\r\nWilliam Crookes was dead.\r\n\r\nHowever, in England, Sir Conan Doyle immediately took up the matter,\r\nand in America Professor Hyslop was called into consultation.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when the Government was beginning to realise what this awful\r\nmenace meant, and that there were actually in the United States\r\npossibly half a dozen people who already had begun to carry on a\r\ndiabolical warfare by means of psychic power, for the purpose of\r\nenslaving and controlling the very minds of men,—then, in the terrible\r\nmoment of discovery, a young girl landed in America after fourteen\r\nyears’ absence in Asia.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the amazing girl that Victor Cleves had just married, at\r\nRecklow’s suggestion, and in the line of professional duty,—and moral\r\nduty, perhaps.\r\n\r\nIt had been a brief, matter-of-fact ceremony. John Recklow, of the\r\nSecret Service, was there; also Benton and Selden of the same service.\r\n\r\nThe bride’s lips were unresponsive; cold as the touch of the groom’s\r\nunsteady hand.\r\n\r\nShe looked down at her new ring in a blank sort of way, gave her hand\r\nlistlessly to Recklow and to the others in turn, whispered a timidly\r\ncomprehensive “Thank you,” and walked away beside Cleves as though\r\ndazed.\r\n\r\nThere was a taxicab waiting. Tressa entered. Recklow came out and spoke\r\nto Cleves in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry,” replied Cleves dryly. “That’s why I married her.”\r\n\r\n“Where are you going now?” inquired Recklow.\r\n\r\n“Back to my apartment.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you take her away for a month?”\r\n\r\nCleves flushed with annoyance: “This is no occasion for a wedding trip.\r\nYou understand that, Recklow.”\r\n\r\n“I understand. But we ought to give her a breathing space. She’s had\r\nnothing but trouble. She’s worn out.”\r\n\r\nCleves hesitated: “I can guard her better in the apartment. Isn’t it\r\nsafer to go back there, where your people are always watching the\r\nstreet and house day and night?”\r\n\r\n“In a way it might be safer, perhaps. But that girl is nearly\r\nexhausted. And her value to us is unlimited. She may be the vital\r\nfactor in this fight with anarchy. Her weapon is her mind. And it’s got\r\nto have a chance to rest.”\r\n\r\nCleves, with one hand on the cab door, looked around impatiently.\r\n\r\n“Do _you_, also, conclude that the psychic factor is actually part of\r\nthis damned problem of Bolshevism?”\r\n\r\nRecklow’s cool eyes measured him: “Do _you_?”\r\n\r\n“My God, Recklow, I don’t know—after what my own eyes have seen.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know either,” said the other calmly, “but I am taking no\r\nchances. I don’t attempt to explain certain things that have occurred.\r\nBut if it be true that a misuse of psychic ability by\r\nforeigners—Asiatics—among the anarchists is responsible for some of the\r\ndevilish things being done in the United States, then your wife’s\r\nunparalleled knowledge of the occult East is absolutely vital to us.\r\nAnd so I say, better take her away somewhere and give her mind a chance\r\nto recover from the incessant strain of these tragic years.”\r\n\r\nThe two men stood silent for a moment, then Recklow went to the window\r\nof the taxicab.\r\n\r\n“I have been suggesting a trip into the country, Mrs. Cleves,” he said\r\npleasantly, “—into the real country, somewhere,—a month’s quiet in the\r\nwoods, perhaps. Wouldn’t it appeal to you?”\r\n\r\nCleves turned to catch her low-voiced answer.\r\n\r\n“I should like it very much,” she said in that odd, hushed way of\r\nspeaking, which seemed to have altered her own voice and manner since\r\nthe ceremony a little while before.\r\n\r\nDriving back to his apartment beside her, he strove to realise that\r\nthis girl was his wife.\r\n\r\nOne of her gloves lay across her lap, and on it rested a slender hand.\r\nAnd on one finger was his ring.\r\n\r\nBut Victor Cleves could not bring himself to believe that this\r\nbrand-new ring really signified anything to him,—that it had altered\r\nhis own life in any way. But always his incredulous eyes returned to\r\nthat slim finger resting there, unstirring, banded with a narrow\r\ncirclet of virgin gold.\r\n\r\nIn the apartment they did not seem to know exactly what to do or\r\nsay—what attitude to assume—what effort to make.\r\n\r\nTressa went into her own room, removed her hat and furs, and came\r\nslowly back into the living-room, where Cleves still stood gazing\r\nabsently out of the window.\r\n\r\nA fine rain was falling.\r\n\r\nThey seated themselves. There seemed nothing better to do.\r\n\r\nHe said, politely: “In regard to going away for a rest, you wouldn’t\r\ncare for the North Woods, I fancy, unless you like winter sports. Do\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“I like sunlight and green leaves,” she said in that odd, still voice.\r\n\r\n“Then, if it would please you to go South for a few weeks’ rest——”\r\n\r\n“Would it inconvenience you?”\r\n\r\nHer manner touched him.\r\n\r\n“My dear Miss Norne,” he began, and checked himself, flushing\r\npainfully. The girl blushed, too; then, when he began to laugh, her\r\nlovely, bashful smile glimmered for the first time.\r\n\r\n“I really can’t bring myself to realise that you and I are married,” he\r\nexplained, still embarrassed, though smiling.\r\n\r\nHer smile became an endeavour. “I can’t believe it either, Mr. Cleves,”\r\nshe said. “I feel rather stunned.”\r\n\r\n“Hadn’t you better call me Victor—under the circumstances?” he\r\nsuggested, striving to speak lightly.\r\n\r\n“Yes.... It will not be very easy to say it—not for some time, I\r\nthink.”\r\n\r\n“Tressa?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—_what_?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—Victor.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the idea,” he insisted with forced gaiety.\r\n\r\n“The thing to do is to face this rather funny situation and take it\r\namiably and with good humour. You’ll have your freedom some day, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—I—know.”\r\n\r\n“And we’re already on very good terms. We find each other interesting,\r\ndon’t we?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“It even seems to me,” he ventured, “it certainly seems to me, at\r\ntimes, as though we are approaching a common basis of—of\r\nmutual—er—esteem.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I—I do esteem you, Mr. Cleves.”\r\n\r\n“In point of fact,” he concluded, surprised, “we _are_ friends—in a\r\nway. Wouldn’t you call it—friendship?”\r\n\r\n“I think so, I think I’d call it that,” she admitted.\r\n\r\n“I think so, too. And that is lucky for us. That makes this crazy\r\nsituation more comfortable—less—well, perhaps less ponderous.”\r\n\r\nThe girl assented with a vague smile, but her eyes remained lowered.\r\n\r\n“You see,” he went on, “when two people are as oddly situated as we\r\nare, they’re likely to be afraid of being in each other’s way. But they\r\nought to get on without being unhappy as long as they are quite\r\nconfident of each other’s friendly consideration. Don’t you think so,\r\nTressa?”\r\n\r\nHer lowered eyes rested steadily on her ring-finger. “Yes,” she said.\r\n“And I am not—unhappy, or—afraid.”\r\n\r\nShe lifted her blue gaze to his; and, somehow, he thought of her\r\nbarbaric name, Keuke,—and its Yezidee significance, “heavenly—azure.”\r\n\r\n“Are we really going away together?” she asked timidly.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, if you wish.”\r\n\r\n“If you, also, wish it, Mr. Cleves.”\r\n\r\nHe found himself saying with emphasis that he always wished to do what\r\nshe desired. And he added, more gently:\r\n\r\n“You _are_ tired, Tressa—tired and lonely and unhappy.”\r\n\r\n“Tired, but not the—others.”\r\n\r\n“Not unhappy?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you lonely?”\r\n\r\n“Not with you.”\r\n\r\nThe answer came so naturally, so calmly, that the slight sensation of\r\npleasure it gave him arrived only as an agreeable afterglow.\r\n\r\n“We’ll go South,” he said.... “I’m so glad that you don’t feel lonely\r\nwith me.”\r\n\r\n“Will it be warmer where we are going, Mr. Cleves?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—you poor child! You need warmth and sunshine, don’t you? Was it\r\nwarm in Yian, where you lived so many years?”\r\n\r\n“It was always June in Yian,” she said under her breath.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to have fallen into a revery; he watched the sensitive face.\r\nAlmost imperceptibly it changed; became altered, younger, strangely\r\nlovely.\r\n\r\nPresently she looked up—and it seemed to him that it was not Tressa\r\nNorne at all he saw, but little Keuke—Heavenly Azure—of the Yezidee\r\ntemple, as she dropped one slim knee over the other and crossed her\r\nhands above it.\r\n\r\n“It was very beautiful in Yian,” she said, “—Yian of the thousand\r\nbridges and scented gardens so full of lilies. Even after they took me\r\nto the temple, and I thought the world was ending, God’s skies still\r\nremained soft overhead, and His weather fair and golden.... And when,\r\nin the month of the Snake, the Eight Sheiks-el-Djebel came to the\r\ntemple to spread their shrouds on the rose-marble steps, then, after\r\nthey had departed, chanting the Prayers for the Dead, each to his Tower\r\nof Silence, we temple girls were free for a week.... And once I went\r\nwith Tchagane—a girl—and with Yulun—another girl—and we took our\r\nkeutch, which is our luggage, and we went to the yaïlak, or summer\r\npavilion on the Lake of the Ghost. Oh, wonderful,—a silvery world of\r\npale-gilt suns and of moons so frail that the cloud-fleece at high-noon\r\nhas more substance!”\r\n\r\nHer voice died out; she sat gazing down at her spread fingers, on one\r\nof which gleamed her wedding-ring.\r\n\r\nAfter a little, she went on dreamily:\r\n\r\n“On that week, each three months, we were free.... If a young man\r\nshould please us....”\r\n\r\n“Free?” he repeated.\r\n\r\n“To love,” she explained coolly.\r\n\r\n“Oh.” He nodded, but his face became rather grim.\r\n\r\n“There came to me at the yaïlak,” she went on carelessly, “one Khassar\r\nNoïane—Noïane means Prince—all in a surcoat of gold tissue with green\r\nvines embroidered, and wearing a green cap trimmed with dormouse, and\r\ngreen boots inlaid with stiff gold....\r\n\r\n“He was so young ... a boy. I laughed. I said: ‘Is this a Yaçaoul? An\r\nUrdu-envoy of Prince Erlik?’—mocking him as young and thoughtless girls\r\nmock—not in unfriendly manner—though I would not endure the touch of\r\nany man at all.\r\n\r\n“And when I laughed at him, this Eighur boy flew into such a rage! Kai!\r\nI was amazed.\r\n\r\n“‘Sou-sou! Squirrel!’ he cried angrily at me. ‘Learn the Yacaz, little\r\nchatterer! Little mocker of men, it is ten blows with a stick you\r\nrequire, not kisses!’\r\n\r\n“At that I whistled my two dogs, Bars and Alaga, for I did not think\r\nwhat he said was funny.\r\n\r\n“I said to him: ‘You had better go home, Khassar Noïane, for if no man\r\nhas ever pleased me where I am at liberty to please myself, here on the\r\nLake of the Ghost, then be very certain that no boy can please\r\nKeuke-Mongol here or anywhere!’\r\n\r\n“And at that—kai! What did he say—that monkey?” She looked at her\r\nhusband, her splendid eyes ablaze with wrathful laughter, and made a\r\ngesture full of angry grace:\r\n\r\n“‘Squirrel!’ he cries—‘little malignant sorceress of Yian! May\r\neverything high about you become a sandstorm, and everything long a\r\nserpent, and everything broad a toad, and everything——’\r\n\r\n“But I had had enough, Victor,” she added excitedly, “and I made a wild\r\nbee bite him on the lip! What do you think of such a courtship?” she\r\ncried, laughing. But Cleves’s face was a study in emotions.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, the laughing mask seemed to slip from the\r\nbewitching features of Keuke Mongol; and there was Tressa Norne—Tressa\r\nCleves—disconcerted, paling a little as the memory of her impulsive\r\nconfidence in this man beside her began to dawn on her more clearly.\r\n\r\n“I—I’m sorry——” she faltered.... “You’ll think me silly—think evil of\r\nme, perhaps——”\r\n\r\nShe looked into his troubled eyes, then suddenly she took her face into\r\nboth hands and covered it, sitting very still.\r\n\r\n“We’ll go South together,” he said in an uncertain voice.... “I hope\r\nyou will try to think of me as a friend.... I’m just troubled because I\r\nam so anxious to understand you. That is all.... I’m—I’m troubled, too,\r\nbecause I am anxious that you should think well of me. Will you try,\r\nalways?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n“I want to be your friend, always,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Mr. Cleves.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a strange spot he chose for Tressa—strange but lovely in its own\r\nunreal and rather spectral fashion—where a pearl-tinted mist veiled the\r\nSt. Johns, and made exquisite ghosts of the palmettos, and softened the\r\nsun to a silver-gilt wafer pasted on a nacre sky.\r\n\r\nIt was a still country, where giant water-oaks towered, fantastic under\r\ntheir misty camouflage of moss, and swarming with small birds.\r\n\r\nAmong the trees the wood-ibis stole; without on the placid glass of the\r\nstream the eared grebe floated. There was no wind, no stirring of\r\nleaves, no sound save the muffled splash of silver mullet, the\r\nbreathless whirr of a humming-bird, or the hushed rustle of lizards in\r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\nFor Tressa this was the blessed balm that heals,—the balm of silence.\r\nAnd, for the first week, she slept most of the time, or lay in her\r\nhammock watching the swarms of small birds creeping and flitting amid\r\nthe moss-draped labyrinths of the live-oaks at her very door.\r\n\r\nIt had been a little club house before the war, this bungalow on the\r\nSt. Johns at Orchid Hammock. Its members had been few and wealthy; but\r\nsome were dead in France and Flanders, and some still remained\r\noverseas, and others continued busy in the North.\r\n\r\nAnd these two young people were quite alone there, save for a negro\r\ncook and a maid, and an aged negro kennel-master who wore a scarlet\r\nwaistcoat and cords too large for his shrunken body, and who pottered,\r\npottered through the fields all day, with his whip clasped behind his\r\nbent back and the pointers ranging wide, or plodding in at heel with\r\nred tongues lolling.\r\n\r\nTwice Cleves went a little way for quail, using Benton’s dogs; but even\r\nhere in this remote spot he dared not move out of view of the little\r\nhouse where Tressa lay asleep.\r\n\r\nSo he picked up only a few brace of birds, and confined his sport to\r\nimpaling too-familiar scorpions on the blade of his knife.\r\n\r\nAnd all the while life remained unreal for him; his marriage seemed\r\nutterly unbelievable; he could not realise it, could not reconcile\r\nhimself to conditions so incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nAlso, ever latent in his mind, was knowledge that made him restless—the\r\nknowledge that the young girl he had married had been in love with\r\nanother man: Sanang.\r\n\r\nAnd there were other thoughts—thoughts which had scarcely even taken\r\nthe shape of questions.\r\n\r\nOne morning he came from his room and found Tressa on the veranda in\r\nher hammock. She had her moon-lute in her lap.\r\n\r\n“You feel better—much better!” he said gaily, saluting her extended\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Isn’t this heavenly? I begin to believe it is life to me, this\r\npearl-tinted world, and the scent of orange bloom and the stillness of\r\nparadise itself.”\r\n\r\nShe gazed out over the ghostly river. Not a wing stirred its glassy\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n“Is this dull for you?” she asked in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Not if you are contented, Tressa.”\r\n\r\n“You’re so nice about it. Don’t you think you might venture a day’s\r\nreal shooting?”\r\n\r\n“No, I think I won’t,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“On my account?”\r\n\r\n“Well—yes.”\r\n\r\n“I’m so sorry.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right as long as you’re getting rested. What is that\r\ninstrument?”\r\n\r\n“My moon-lute.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, is that what it’s called?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded, touched the strings. He watched her exquisite hands.\r\n\r\n“Shall I?” she inquired a little shyly.\r\n\r\n“Go ahead. I’d like to hear it!”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t touched it in months—not since I was on the steamer.” She\r\nsat up in her hammock and began to swing there; and played and sang\r\nwhile swinging in the flecked shadow of the orange bloom:\r\n\r\n“_Little Isle of Cispangou,_\r\n_Isle of iris, isle of cherry,_\r\n_Tell your tiny maidens merry_\r\n_Clouds are looming over you!_\r\n_La-ē-la!_\r\n_La-ē-la!_\r\n_All your ocean’s but a ferry;_\r\n_Ships are bringing death to you!_\r\n_La-ē-lou!_\r\n_La-ē-lou!_\r\n\r\n“_Little Isle of Cispangou,_\r\n_Half a thousand ships are sailing;_\r\n_Captain Death commands each crew;_\r\n_Lo! the ruddy moon is paling!_\r\n_La-ē-la!_\r\n_La-ē-la!_\r\n_Clouds the dying moon are veiling,_\r\n_Every cloud a shroud for you!_\r\n_La-ē-lou!_\r\n_La-ē-lou!_”\r\n\r\n“Cispangou,” she explained, “is the very, very ancient name, among the\r\nMongols, for Japan.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not exactly a gay song,” he said. “What’s it about?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s a very ancient song about the Mongol invasion of Japan. I\r\nknow scores and scores of such songs.”\r\n\r\nShe sang some other songs. Afterward she descended from the hammock and\r\ncame and sat down beside him on the veranda steps.\r\n\r\n“I wish I could amuse you,” she said wistfully.\r\n\r\n“Why do you think I’m bored, Tressa? I’m not at all.”\r\n\r\nBut she only sighed, lightly, and gathered her knees in both arms.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how young men in the Western world are entertained,” she\r\nremarked presently.\r\n\r\n“You don’t have to entertain me,” he said, smiling.\r\n\r\n“I should be happy to, if I knew how.”\r\n\r\n“How are young men entertained in the Orient?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, they like songs and stories. But I don’t think you do.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n“Do you really wish to entertain me?”\r\n\r\n“I do,” she said seriously.\r\n\r\n“Then please perform some of those tricks of magic which you can do so\r\namazingly well.”\r\n\r\nHer dawning smile faded a trifle. “I don’t—I haven’t——” She hesitated.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t your professional paraphernalia with you,” he suggested.\r\n\r\n“Oh—as for that——”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you need it?”\r\n\r\n“For some things—some kinds of things.... I _could_ do—other things——”\r\n\r\nHe waited. She seemed disconcerted. “Don’t do anything you don’t wish\r\nto do, Tressa,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I was only—only afraid—that if I should do some little things to amuse\r\nyou, I might stir—stir up—interfere—encounter some sinister current—and\r\nbetray myself—betray my whereabouts——”\r\n\r\n“Well, for heaven’s sake don’t venture then!” he said with emphasis.\r\n“Don’t do anything to stir up any other wireless—any Yezidee——”\r\n\r\n“I am wondering,” she reflected, “just what I dare venture to do to\r\namuse you.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t bother about me. I wouldn’t have you try any psychic stunt down\r\nhere, and run the chance of stirring up some Asiatic devil somewhere!”\r\n\r\nShe nodded absently, occupied with her own thoughts, sitting there,\r\nchin on hand, her musing eyes intensely blue.\r\n\r\n“I think I can amuse you,” she concluded, “without bringing any harm to\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t try it, Tressa!—--”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be very careful. Now, sit quite still—closer to me, please.”\r\n\r\nHe edged closer; and became conscious of an indefinable freshness in\r\nthe air that enveloped him, like the scent of something young and\r\ngrowing. But it was no magic odour,—merely the virginal scent of her\r\nhair and skin that even clung to her summer gown.\r\n\r\nHe heard her singing under her breath to herself:\r\n\r\n“La-ē-la!\r\nLa-ē-la!”\r\n\r\nand murmuring caressingly in an unknown tongue.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly in the pale sunshine, scores of little birds came\r\nhovering around them, alighting all over them. And he saw them swarming\r\nout of the mossy festoons of the water-oaks—scores and scores of tiny\r\nbirds—Parula warblers, mostly—all flitting fearlessly down to alight\r\nupon his shoulders and knees, all keeping up their sweet, dreamy little\r\ntwittering sound.\r\n\r\n“This is wonderful,” he whispered.\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed, took several birds on her forefinger.\r\n\r\n“This is nothing,” she said. “If I only dared—wait a moment!—--” And,\r\nto the Parula warblers:\r\n\r\n“Go home, little friends of God!”\r\n\r\nThe air was filled with the musical whisper of wings. She passed her\r\nright arm around her husband’s neck.\r\n\r\n“Look at the river,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” he blurted out. And sat dumb.\r\n\r\nFor, over the St. John’s misty surface, there was the span of a\r\nbridge—a strange, marble bridge humped up high in the centre.\r\n\r\nAnd over it were passing thousands of people—he could make them out\r\nvaguely—see them passing in two never-ending streams—tinted shapes on\r\nthe marble bridge.\r\n\r\nAnd now, on the farther shore of the river, he was aware of a city—a\r\nvast one, with spectral pagoda shapes against the sky——\r\n\r\nHer arm tightened around his neck.\r\n\r\nHe saw boats on the river—like the grotesque shapes that decorate\r\nancient lacquer.\r\n\r\nShe rested her face lightly against his cheek.\r\n\r\nIn his ears was a far confusion of voices—the stir and movement of\r\nmultitudes—noises on ships, boatmen’s cries, the creak of oars.\r\n\r\nThen, far and sonorous, quavering across the water from the city, the\r\ndin of a temple gong.\r\n\r\nThere were bells, too—very sweet and silvery—camel bells, bells from\r\nthe Buddhist temples.\r\n\r\nHe strained his eyes, and thought, amid the pagodas, that there were\r\nminarets, also.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, clear and ringing came the distant muezzin’s cry: “There is\r\nno other god but God!... It is noon. Mussulmans, pray!”\r\n\r\nThe girl’s arm slipped from his neck and she shuddered and pushed him\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing, now, on the river or beyond it but the curtain of\r\nhanging mist; no sound except the cry of a gull, sharp and querulous in\r\nthe vapours overhead.\r\n\r\n“Have—have you been amused?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“What did you do to me!” he demanded harshly.\r\n\r\nShe smiled and drew a light breath like a sigh.\r\n\r\n“God knows what we living do to one another,—or to ourselves,” she\r\nsaid. “I only tried to amuse you—after taking counsel with the birds.”\r\n\r\n“What was that bridge I saw!”\r\n\r\n“The Bridge of Ten Thousand Felicities.”\r\n\r\n“And the city?”\r\n\r\n“Yian.”\r\n\r\n“You lived there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nHe moistened his dry lips and stole another glance at this very\r\ncommonplace Florida river. Sky and water were blank and still, and the\r\nghostly trees stood tall, reflected palely in the translucent tide.\r\n\r\n“You merely made me visualise what you were thinking about,” he\r\nconcluded in a voice which still remained unsteady.\r\n\r\n“Did you _hear_ nothing?”\r\n\r\nHe was silent, remembering the bells and the enormous murmur of a\r\nliving multitude.\r\n\r\n“And—there were the birds, too.” She added, with an uncertain smile: “I\r\ndo not mean to worry you.... And you did ask me to amuse you.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how you did it,” he said harshly. “And the details—those\r\nthousands and thousands of people on the bridge!... And there was one,\r\nquite near this end of the bridge, who looked back.... A young girl who\r\nturned and laughed at us—”\r\n\r\n“That was Yulun.”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Yulun. I taught her English.”\r\n\r\n“A temple girl?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. From Black China.”\r\n\r\n“How could you make _me_ see _her_!” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Why do you ask such things? I do not know how to tell you how I do\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a dangerous, uncanny knowledge!” he blurted out; and suddenly\r\nchecked himself, for the girl’s face went white.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean uncanny,” he hastened to add. “Because it seems to me\r\nthat what you did by juggling with invisible currents to which, when\r\nattuned, our five senses respond, is on the same lines as the wireless\r\ntelegraph and telephone.”\r\n\r\nShe said nothing, but her colour slowly returned.\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t be so sensitive,” he added. “I’ve no doubt that it’s all\r\nquite normal—quite explicable on a perfectly scientific basis. Probably\r\nit’s no more mysterious than a man in an airplane over midocean\r\nconversing with people ashore on two continents.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the remainder of the day and evening Tressa seemed subdued—not\r\nrestless, not nervous, but so quiet that, sometimes, glancing at her\r\naskance, Cleves involuntarily was reminded of some lithe young creature\r\nof the wilds, intensely alert and still, immersed in fixed and\r\ndangerous meditation.\r\n\r\nAbout five in the afternoon they took their golf sticks, went down to\r\nthe river, and embarked in the canoe.\r\n\r\nThe water was glassy and still. There was not a ripple ahead, save when\r\na sleeping gull awoke and leisurely steered out of their way.\r\n\r\nTressa’s arms and throat were bare and she wore no hat. She sat\r\nforward, wielding the bow paddle and singing to herself in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“You feel all right, don’t you?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am so well, physically, now! It’s really wonderful, Victor—like\r\nbeing a child again,” she replied happily.\r\n\r\n“You’re not much more,” he muttered.\r\n\r\nShe heard him: “Not very much more—in years,” she said.... “Does\r\nScripture tell us how old Our Lord was when He descended into Hell?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” he replied, startled.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while Tressa tranquilly resumed her paddling and\r\nsinging:\r\n\r\n“_—And eight tall towers_\r\n_Guard the route_\r\n_Of human life,_\r\n_Where at all hours_\r\n_Death looks out,_\r\n_Holding a knife_\r\n_Rolled in a shroud._\r\n\r\n_For every man,_\r\n_Humble or proud,_\r\n_Mighty or bowed,_\r\n_Death has a shroud;—for every man,—_\r\n_Even for Tchingniz Khan!_\r\n_Behold them pass!—lancer._\r\n_Baroulass,_\r\n_Temple dancer_\r\n_In tissue gold,_\r\n_Khiounnou,_\r\n_Karlik bold,_\r\n\r\n_Christian, Jew,—_\r\n_Nations swarm to the great Urdu._\r\n_Yaçaoul, with your kettledrum,_\r\n_Warn your Khan that his hour is come!_\r\n_Shroud and knife at his spurred feet throw,_\r\n_And bid him stretch his neck for the blow!—_”\r\n\r\n“You know,” remarked Cleves, “that some of those songs you sing are\r\ndevilish creepy.”\r\n\r\nTressa looked around at him over her shoulder, saw he was smiling,\r\nsmiled faintly in return.\r\n\r\nThey were off Orchid Cove now. The hotel and cottages loomed dimly in\r\nthe silver mist. Voices came distinctly across the water. There were\r\npeople on the golf course paralleling the river; laughter sounded from\r\nthe club-house veranda.\r\n\r\nThey went ashore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nTHE MAN IN WHITE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at the sixth hole that they passed the man ahead who was playing\r\nall alone—a courteous young fellow in white flannels, who smiled and\r\nbowed them “through” in silence.\r\n\r\nThey thanked him, drove from the tee, and left the polite and reticent\r\nyoung man still apparently hunting for a lost ball.\r\n\r\nLike other things which depended upon dexterity and precision, Tressa\r\nhad taken most naturally to golf. Her supple muscles helped.\r\n\r\nAt the ninth hole they looked back but did not see the young man in\r\nwhite flannels.\r\n\r\nHammock, set with pine and palmetto, and intervals of evil-looking\r\nswamp, flanked the course. Rank wire-grass, bayberry and scrub palmetto\r\nbounded the fairgreen.\r\n\r\nOn every blossoming bush hung butterflies—Palomedes\r\nswallowtails—drugged with sparkle-berry honey, their gold and black\r\nvelvet wings conspicuous in the sunny mist.\r\n\r\n“Like the ceremonial vestments of a Yezidee executioner,” murmured the\r\ngirl. “The Tchortchas wear red when they robe to do a man to death.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you could forget those things,” said Cleves.\r\n\r\n“I am trying.... I wonder where that young man in white went.”\r\n\r\nCleves searched the links. “I don’t see him. Perhaps he had to go back\r\nfor another ball.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder who he was,” she mused.\r\n\r\n“I don’t remember seeing him before,” said Cleves.... “Shall we start\r\nback?”\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly across the course toward the tenth hole.\r\n\r\nTressa teed up, drove low and straight. Cleves sliced, and they walked\r\ntogether into the scrub and towards the woods, where his ball had\r\nbounded into a bunch of palm trees.\r\n\r\nFar in among the trees something white moved and vanished.\r\n\r\n“Probably a white egret,” he remarked, knocking about in the scrub with\r\nhis midiron.\r\n\r\n“It was that young man in white flannels,” said Tressa in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“What would he be doing in there?” he asked incredulously. “That’s\r\nmerely a jungle, Tressa—swamp and cypress, thorn and creeper,—and no\r\nman would go into that mess if he could. There is no bottom to those\r\nswamps.”\r\n\r\n“But I saw him in there,” she said in a troubled voice.\r\n\r\n“But when I tell you that only a wild animal or a snake or a bird could\r\nmove in that jungle! The bog is one vast black quicksand. There’s death\r\nin those depths.”\r\n\r\n“Victor.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” He looked around at her. She was pale. He came up and took her\r\nhand inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t feel—well,” she murmured. “I’m not ill, you understand——”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, Tressa?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head drearily: “I don’t know.... I wonder whether I\r\nshould have tried to amuse you this morning——”\r\n\r\n“You don’t think you’ve stirred up any of those Yezidee beasts, do\r\nyou?” he asked sharply.\r\n\r\nAnd as she did not answer, he asked again whether she was afraid that\r\nwhat she had done that morning might have had any occult consequences.\r\nAnd he reminded her that she had hesitated to venture anything on that\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nHis voice, in spite of him, betrayed great nervousness now, and he saw\r\napprehension in her eyes, also.\r\n\r\n“Why should that man in white have followed us, keeping out of sight in\r\nthe woods?” he went on. “Did you notice about him anything to disturb\r\nyou, Tressa?”\r\n\r\n“Not at the time. But—it’s odd—I can’t put him out of my mind. Since we\r\npassed him and left him apparently hunting a lost ball, I have not been\r\nable to put him out of my mind.”\r\n\r\n“He seemed civil and well bred. He was perfectly good-humoured—all\r\ncourtesy and smiles.”\r\n\r\n“I think—perhaps—it was the way he smiled at us,” murmured the girl.\r\n“Everybody in the East smiles when they draw a knife....”\r\n\r\nHe placed his arm through hers. “Aren’t you a trifle morbid?” he said\r\npleasantly.\r\n\r\nShe stooped for her golf ball, retaining a hold on his arm. He picked\r\nup his ball, too, put away her clubs and his, and they started back\r\ntogether in silence, evidently with no desire to make it eighteen\r\nholes.\r\n\r\n“It’s a confounded shame,” he muttered, “just as you were becoming so\r\nrested and so delightfully well, to have anything—any unpleasant flash\r\nof memory cut in to upset you——”\r\n\r\n“I brought it on myself. I should not have risked stirring up the\r\nsinister minds that were asleep.”\r\n\r\n“Hang it all!—and I asked you to amuse me.”\r\n\r\n“It was not wise in me,” she said under her breath. “It is easy to\r\ndisturb the unknown currents which enmesh the globe. I ought not to\r\nhave shown you Yian. I ought not to have shown you Yulun. It was my\r\nfault for doing that. I was a little lonely, and I wanted to see\r\nYulun.”\r\n\r\nThey came down the river back to the canoe, threw in their golf bags,\r\nand embarked on the glassy stream.\r\n\r\nOver the calm flood, stained deep with crimson, the canoe glided in the\r\nsanguine evening light. But Tressa sang no more and her head was bent\r\nsideways as though listening—always listening—to something inaudible to\r\nCleves—something very, very far away which she seemed to hear through\r\nthe still drip of the paddles.\r\n\r\nThey were not yet in sight of their landing when she spoke to him,\r\npartly turning:\r\n\r\n“I think some of your men have arrived.”\r\n\r\n“Where?” he asked, astonished.\r\n\r\n“At the house.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you think so?”\r\n\r\n“I think so.”\r\n\r\nThey paddled a little faster. In a few minutes their dock came into\r\nview.\r\n\r\n“It’s funny,” he said, “that you should think some of our men have\r\narrived from the North. I don’t see anybody on the dock.”\r\n\r\n“It’s Mr. Recklow,” she said in a low voice. “He is seated on our\r\nveranda.”\r\n\r\nAs it was impossible to see the house, let alone the veranda, Cleves\r\nmade no reply. He beached the canoe; Tressa stepped out; he followed,\r\ncarrying the golf bags.\r\n\r\nA mousy light lingered in the shrubbery; bats were flying against a\r\nsalmon-tinted sky as they took the path homeward.\r\n\r\nWith an impulse quite involuntary, Cleves encircled his young wife’s\r\nshoulders with his left arm.\r\n\r\n“Girl-comrade,” he said lightly, “I’d kill any man who even looked as\r\nthough he’d harm you.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled, but she had not missed the ugly undertone in his words.\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly, his arm around her shoulders. Suddenly he felt her\r\nstart. They halted.\r\n\r\n“What was it?” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“I thought there was something white in the woods.”\r\n\r\n“Where, dear?” he asked coolly.\r\n\r\n“Over there beyond the lawn.”\r\n\r\nWhat she called the “lawn” was only a vast sheet of pink and white\r\nphlox, now all misty with the whirring wings of sphinx-moths and\r\nNoctuidæ.\r\n\r\nThe oak grove beyond was dusky. Cleves could see nothing among the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment they went forward. His arm had fallen away from her\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nThere were no lights except in the kitchen when they came in sight of\r\nthe house. At first nobody was visible on the screened veranda under\r\nthe orange trees. But when he opened the swing door for her a shadowy\r\nfigure arose from a chair.\r\n\r\nIt was John Recklow. He came forward, bent his strong white head, and\r\nkissed Tressa’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Is all well with you, Mrs. Cleves?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I am glad you came.”\r\n\r\nCleves clasped the elder man’s firm hand.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad too, Recklow. You’ll stop with us, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Do you really want me?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Cleves.\r\n\r\n“All right. I’ve a coon and a surrey behind your house.”\r\n\r\nSo Cleves went around in the dusk and sent the outfit back to the\r\nhotel, and he himself carried in Recklow’s suitcase.\r\n\r\nThen Tressa went away to give instructions, and the two men were left\r\ntogether on the dusky veranda.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Recklow quietly.\r\n\r\nCleves went to him and rested both hands on his shoulders:\r\n\r\n“I’m playing absolutely square. She’s a perfectly fine girl and she’ll\r\nhave her chance some day, God willing.”\r\n\r\n“Her chance?” repeated Recklow.\r\n\r\n“To marry whatever man she will some day care for.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Recklow drily.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, then:\r\n\r\n“She’s simply a splendid specimen of womanhood,” said Cleves earnestly.\r\n“And intensely interesting to me. Why, Recklow, I haven’t known a dull\r\nmoment—though I fear she has known many——”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Why? Well, being married to a—a sort of temporary figurehead—shut up\r\nhere all day alone with a man of no particular interest to her——”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you interest her?”\r\n\r\n“Well, how could I? She didn’t choose me because she liked me\r\nparticularly.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t she?” asked Recklow, still more drily. “Well, that does make it\r\na trifle dull for you both.”\r\n\r\n“Not for me,” said the younger man naïvely. “She is one of the most\r\ninteresting women I ever met. And good heavens!—what psychic knowledge\r\nthat child possesses! She did a thing to-day—merely to amuse me——” He\r\nchecked himself and looked at Recklow out of sombre eyes.\r\n\r\n“What did she do?” inquired the older man.\r\n\r\n“I think I’ll let her tell you—if she wishes.... And that reminds me.\r\nWhy did you come down here, Recklow?”\r\n\r\n“I want to show you something, Cleves. May we step into the house?”\r\n\r\nThey went into a little lamplit living-room. Recklow handed a newspaper\r\nclipping to Cleves: the latter read it, standing:\r\n\r\n“Had Deadliest Gas Ready for Germans\r\n\r\n“_‘Lewisite’ Might Have Killed Millions_\r\n\r\n“Washington, April 24.—Guarded night and day and far out of human reach\r\non a pedestal at the Interior Department Exposition here is a tiny\r\nvial. It contains a specimen of the deadliest poison ever known,\r\n‘Lewisite,’ the product of an American scientist.\r\n\r\n“Germany escaped this poison by signing the armistice before all the\r\nresources of the United States were turned upon her.\r\n\r\n“Ten airplanes carrying ‘Lewisite’ would have wiped out, it is said,\r\nevery vestige of life—animal and vegetable—in Berlin. A single day’s\r\noutput would snuff out the millions of lives on Manhattan Island. A\r\ndrop poured in the palm of the hand would penetrate to the blood, reach\r\nthe heart and kill the victim in agony.\r\n\r\n“What was coming to Germany may be imagined by the fact that when the\r\narmistice was signed ‘Lewisite’ was being manufactured at the rate of\r\nten tons a day. Three thousand tons of this most terrible instrument\r\never conceived for killing would have been ready for business on the\r\nAmerican front in France on November 1.\r\n\r\n“‘Lewisite’ is another of the big secrets of the war just leaking out.\r\nIt was developed in the Bureau of Mines by Professor W. Lee Lewis, of\r\nNorthwestern University, Evanston, Ill., who took a commission as a\r\ncaptain in the army.\r\n\r\n“The poison was manufactured in a specially built plant near Cleveland,\r\ncalled the ‘Mouse Trap,’ because every workman who entered the stockade\r\nwent under an agreement not to leave the eleven-acre space until the\r\nwar was won. The object of this, of course, was to protect the secret.\r\n\r\n“Work on the plant was started eighteen days after the Bureau of Mines\r\nhad completed its experiments.\r\n\r\n“Experts are certain that no one will want to steal the sample.\r\nEverybody at the Exposition, which shows what Secretary Lane’s\r\ndepartment is doing, keeps as far away from it as possible.”\r\n\r\nWhen Cleves had finished reading, he raised his eyes in silence.\r\n\r\n“That vial was stolen a week ago,” said Recklow gravely, “by a young\r\nman who killed one guard and fatally wounded the other.”\r\n\r\n“Was there any ante-mortem statement?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I’ve followed the man. I lost all trace of him at Palm Beach, but\r\nI picked it up again at Ormond. _And now I’m here_, Cleves.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean you’ve traced him here!” exclaimed Cleves under his\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n“He’s here on the St. Johns River, somewhere. He came up in a\r\nmotor-boat, but left it east of Orchard Cove. Benton knows this\r\ncountry. He’s covering the motor-boat. And I—came here to see how you\r\nare getting on.”\r\n\r\n“And to warn us,” added Cleves quietly.\r\n\r\n“Well—yes. He’s got that stuff. It’s deadlier than the newspaper\r\nsuspects. And I guess—I guess, Cleves, he’s one of those damned Yezidee\r\nwitch-doctors—or sorcerers, as they call them;—one of that sect of\r\nAssassins sent over here to work havoc on feeble minds and do murder on\r\nthe side.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Because the dirty beast lugs his shroud around with him—a bed-sheet\r\nstolen from the New Willard in Washington.\r\n\r\n“We were so close to him in Jacksonville that we got it, and his\r\nluggage. But we didn’t get him, the rat! God knows how he knew we were\r\nwaiting for him in his room. He never came back to get his luggage.\r\n\r\n“But he stole a bed-sheet from his hotel in St. Augustine, and that is\r\nhow we picked him up again. Then, at Palm Beach, we lost the beggar,\r\nbut somehow or other I felt it in my bones that he was after you—you\r\nand your wife. So I sent Benton to Ormond and I went to Palatka. Benton\r\npicked up his trail. It led toward you—toward the St. Johns. And the\r\nreptile has been here forty-eight hours, trying to nose you out, I\r\nsuppose——”\r\n\r\nTressa came into the room. Both men looked at her.\r\n\r\nCleves said in a guarded voice:\r\n\r\n“To-day, on the golf links at Orchard Cove, there was a young man in\r\nwhite flannels—very polite and courteous to us—but—Tressa thought she\r\nsaw him slinking through the woods as though following and watching\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“My man, probably,” said Recklow. He turned quietly to Tressa and\r\nsketched for her the substance of what he had just told Cleves.\r\n\r\n“The man in white flannels on the golf links,” said Cleves, “was well\r\nbuilt and rather handsome, and not more than twenty-five. I thought he\r\nwas a Jew.”\r\n\r\n“I thought so too,” said Tressa, calmly, “until I saw him in the woods.\r\nAnd then—and then—suddenly it came to me that his smile was the smile\r\nof a treacherous Shaman sorcerer.\r\n\r\n“... And the idea haunts me—the memory of those smooth-faced, smiling\r\nmen in white—men who smile only when they slay—when they slay body and\r\nsoul under the iris skies of Yian!—O God, merciful, long suffering,”\r\nshe whispered, staring into the East, “deliver our souls from Satan who\r\nwas stoned, and our bodies from the snare of the Yezidee!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nTHE WEST WIND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night grew sweet with the scent of orange bloom, and all the\r\nperfumed darkness was vibrant with the feathery whirr of hawk-moths’\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nTressa had taken her moon-lute to the hammock, but her fingers rested\r\nmotionless on the strings.\r\n\r\nCleves and Recklow, shoulder to shoulder, paced the moonlit path along\r\nthe hedges of oleander and hibiscus which divided garden from jungle.\r\n\r\nAnd they moved cautiously on the white-shell road, not too near the\r\nshadow line. For in the cypress swamp the bloated grey death was awake\r\nand watching under the moon; and in the scrub palmetto the\r\ndiamond-dotted death moved lithely.\r\n\r\nAnd somewhere within the dark evil of the jungle a man in white might\r\nbe watching.\r\n\r\nSo Recklow’s pistol swung lightly in his right hand and Cleves’ weapon\r\nlay in his side-pocket, and they strolled leisurely around the drive\r\nand up and down the white-shell walks, passing Tressa at regular\r\nintervals, where she sat in her hammock with the moon-lute across her\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nOnce Cleves paused to place two pink hibiscus blossoms in her hair\r\nabove her ears; and the girl smiled gravely at him in the light.\r\n\r\nAgain, pausing beside her hammock on one of their tours of the garden,\r\nRecklow said in a low voice: “If the beast would only show himself,\r\nMrs. Cleves, we’d not miss him. Have you caught a glimpse of anything\r\nwhite in the woods?”\r\n\r\n“Only the night mist rising from the branch and a white ibis stealing\r\nthrough it.”\r\n\r\nCleves came nearer: “Do you think the Yezidee is in the woods watching\r\nus, Tressa?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he is there,” she said calmly.\r\n\r\n“You _know_ it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nRecklow stared at the woods. “We can’t go in to hunt for him,” he said.\r\n“That fellow would get us with his Lewisite gas before we could\r\ndiscover and destroy him.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose he waits for a west wind and squirts his gas in this\r\ndirection?” whispered Cleves.\r\n\r\n“There is no wind,” said Tressa tranquilly. “He has been waiting for\r\nit, I think. The Yezidee is very patient. And he is a Shaman sorcerer.”\r\n\r\n“My God!” breathed Recklow. “What sort of hellish things has the Old\r\nWorld been dumping into America for the last fifty years? An ordinary\r\nanarchist is bad enough, but this new breed of devil—these\r\nYezidees—this sect of Assassins——”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” whispered Tressa.\r\n\r\nAll three listened to the great cat-owl howling from the jungle. But\r\nTressa had heard another sound—the vague stir of leaves in the\r\nlive-oaks. Was it a passing breeze? Was a night wind rising? She\r\nlistened. But heard no brittle clatter from the palm-fronds.\r\n\r\n“Victor,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Tressa.”\r\n\r\n“If a wind comes, we must hunt him. That will be necessary.”\r\n\r\n“Either we hunt him and get him, or he kills us here with his gas,”\r\nsaid Recklow quietly.\r\n\r\n“If the night wind comes,” said Tressa, “we must hunt the darkness for\r\nthe Yezidee.” She spoke coolly.\r\n\r\n“If he’d only show himself,” muttered Recklow, staring into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe girl picked up her lute, caught Cleves’ worried eyes fixed on her,\r\nsuddenly comprehended that his anxiety was on her account, and blushed\r\nbrightly in the moonlight. And he saw her teeth catch at her underlip;\r\nsaw her look up again at him, confused.\r\n\r\n“If I dared leave you,” he said, “I’d go into the hammock and start\r\nthat reptile. This won’t do—this standing pat while he comes to some\r\ndeadly decision in the woods there.”\r\n\r\n“What else is there to do?” growled Recklow.\r\n\r\n“Watch,” said the girl. “Out-watch the Yezidee. If there is no\r\nnight-wind he may tire of waiting. Then you must shoot fast—very, very\r\nfast and straight. But if the night-wind comes, then we must hunt him\r\nin darkness.”\r\n\r\nRecklow, pistol in hand, stood straight and sturdy in the moonlight,\r\ngazing fixedly at the forest. Cleves sat down at his wife’s feet.\r\n\r\nShe touched her moon-lute tranquilly and sang in her childish voice:\r\n\r\n“_Ring, ring, Buddha bells,_\r\n_Gilded gods are listening._\r\n_Swing, swing, lily bells,_\r\n_In my garden glistening._\r\n_Now I hear the Shaman drum;_\r\n_Now the scarlet horsemen come;_\r\n_Ding-dong!_\r\n_Ding-dong!_\r\n_Through the chanting of the throng_\r\n_Thunders now the temple gong._\r\n_Boom-boom!_\r\n_Ding-dong!_\r\n\r\n“_Let the gold gods listen!_\r\n_In my garden; what care I_\r\n_Where my lily bells hang mute!_\r\n_Snowy-sweet they glisten_\r\n_Where I’m singing to my lute._\r\n_In my garden; what care I_\r\n_Who is dead and who shall die?_\r\n_Let the gold gods save or slay_\r\n_Scented lilies bloom in May._\r\n_Boom, boom, temple gong!_\r\n_Ding-dong!_\r\n_Ding-dong!_”\r\n\r\n“What are you singing?” whispered Cleves.\r\n\r\n“‘The Bells of Yian.’”\r\n\r\n“Is it old?”\r\n\r\n“Of the 13th century. There were few Buddhist bells in Yian then. It is\r\nLamaism that has destroyed the Mongols and that has permitted the creed\r\nof the Assassins to spread—the devil worship of Erlik.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, not understanding. And she, pale, slim prophetess, in\r\nthe moonlight, gazed at him out of lost eyes—eyes which saw, perhaps,\r\nthe bloody age of men when mankind took the devil by the throat and all\r\nMount Alamout went up in smoking ruin; and the Eight Towers were dark\r\nas death and as silent before the blast of the silver clarions of\r\nGhenghis Khan.\r\n\r\n“Something is stirring in the forest,” whispered Tressa, her fingers on\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\n“Damnation,” muttered Recklow, “it’s the wind!”\r\n\r\nThey listened. Far in the forest they heard the clatter of palm-fronds.\r\nThey waited. The ominous warning grew faint, then rose again,—a long,\r\nlow rattle of palm-fronds which became a steady monotone.\r\n\r\n“We hunt,” said Recklow bluntly. “Come on!”\r\n\r\nBut the girl sprang from the hammock and caught her husband’s arm and\r\ndrew Recklow back from the hibiscus hedge.\r\n\r\n“Use me,” she said. “You could never find the Yezidee. Let me do the\r\nhunting; and then shoot very, very fast.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to take her,” said Recklow. “We dare not leave her.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t let her lead the way into those black woods,” muttered Cleves.\r\n\r\n“The wind is blowing in my face,” insisted Recklow. “We’d better\r\nhurry.”\r\n\r\nTressa laid one hand on her husband’s arm.\r\n\r\n“I can find the Yezidee, I think. You never could find him before he\r\nfinds you! Victor, let me use my own _knowledge_! Let me find the way.\r\nPlease let me lead! Please, Victor. Because, if you don’t, I’m afraid\r\nwe’ll all die here in the garden where we stand.”\r\n\r\nCleves cast a haggard glance at Recklow, then looked at his wife.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe girl opened the hedge gate. Both men followed with pistols lifted.\r\n\r\nThe moon silvered the forest. There was no mist, but a night-wind blew\r\nmournfully through palm and cypress, carrying with it the strange,\r\ndisturbing pungency of the jungle—wild, unfamiliar perfumes,—the acrid\r\naroma of swamp and rotting mould.\r\n\r\n“What about snakes?” muttered Recklow, knee deep in wild phlox.\r\n\r\nBut there was a deadlier snake to find and destroy, somewhere in the\r\nblotched shadows of the forest.\r\n\r\nThe first sentinel trees were very near, now; and Tressa was running\r\nacross a ghostly tangle, where once had been an orange grove, and where\r\naged and dying citrus stumps rose stark amid the riot of encroaching\r\njungle.\r\n\r\n“She’s circling to get the wind at our backs,” breathed Recklow,\r\nrunning forward beside Cleves. “That’s our only chance to kill the\r\ndirty rat—catch him with the wind at our backs!”\r\n\r\nOnce, traversing a dry hammock where streaks of moonlight alternated\r\nwith velvet-black shadow a rattlesnake sprang his goblin alarm.\r\n\r\nThey could not locate the reptile. They shrank together and moved\r\nwarily, chilled with fear.\r\n\r\nOnce, too, clear in the moonlight, the Grey Death reared up from\r\nbloated folds and stood swaying rhythmically in a horrible shadow dance\r\nbefore them. And Cleves threw one arm around his wife and crept past,\r\ngiving death a wide berth there in the checkered moonlight.\r\n\r\nNow, under foot, the dry hammock lay everywhere and the night wind blew\r\non their backs.\r\n\r\nThen Tressa turned and halted the two men with a gesture. And went to\r\nher husband where he stood in the palm forest, and laid her hands on\r\nhis shoulders, looking him very wistfully in the eyes.\r\n\r\nUnder her searching gaze he seemed oddly to comprehend her appeal.\r\n\r\n“You are going to use—to use your _knowledge_,” he said mechanically.\r\n“You are going to find the man in white.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You are going to find him in a way we don’t understand,” he continued,\r\ndully.\r\n\r\n“Yes.... You will not hold me in—in horror—will you?”\r\n\r\nRecklow came up, making no sound on the spongy palm litter underfoot.\r\n\r\n“Can you find this devil?” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“I—think so.”\r\n\r\n“Does your super-instinct—finer sense—knowledge—whatever it is—give you\r\nany inkling as to his whereabouts, Mrs. Cleves?”\r\n\r\n“I think he is here in this hammock. Only——” she turned again, with\r\nswift impulse, to her husband, “—only if you—if _you_ do not hold me\r\nin—in horror—because of what I do——”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence; then:\r\n\r\n“What are you about to do?” he asked hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Slay this man.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll do that,” said Cleves with a shudder. “Only show him to us and\r\nwe’ll shoot the dirty reptile to slivers——”\r\n\r\n“Suppose we hit the jar of gas,” said Recklow.\r\n\r\nAfter a silence, Tressa said:\r\n\r\n“I have got to give him back to Satan. There is no other way. I\r\nunderstood that from the first. He can not die by your pistols, though\r\nyou shoot very fast and straight. No!”\r\n\r\nAfter another silence, Recklow said:\r\n\r\n“You had better find him before the wind changes. We hunt down wind\r\nor—we die here together.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at her husband.\r\n\r\n“Show him to us in your own way,” he said, “and deal with him as he\r\nmust be dealt with.”\r\n\r\nA gleam passed across her pale face and she tried to smile at her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nThen, turning down the hammock to the east, she walked noiselessly\r\nforward over the fibrous litter, the men on either side of her, their\r\npistols poised.\r\n\r\nThey had halted on the edge of an open glade, ringed with young pines\r\nin fullest plumage.\r\n\r\nTressa was standing very straight and still in a strange, supple,\r\nagonised attitude, her left forearm across her eyes, her right hand\r\nclenched, her slender body slightly twisted to the left.\r\n\r\nThe men gazed pallidly at her with tense, set faces, knowing that the\r\ngirl was in terrible mental conflict against another mind—a powerful,\r\nsinister mind which was seeking to grasp her thoughts and control them.\r\n\r\nMinute after minute sped: the girl never moved, locked in her psychic\r\nduel with this other brutal mind,—beating back its terrible\r\nthought-waves which were attacking her, fighting for mental supremacy,\r\nstruggling in silence with an unseen adversary whose mental dominance\r\nmeant death.\r\n\r\nSuddenly her cry rang out sharply in the moonlight, and then, all at\r\nonce, a man in white stood there in the lustre of the moon—a young,\r\ngraceful man dressed in white flannels and carrying on his right arm\r\nwhat seemed to be a long white cloak.\r\n\r\nInstantly the girl was transformed from a living statue into a lithe,\r\nsupple, lightly moving thing that passed swiftly to the west of the\r\nglade, keeping the young man in white facing the wind, which was\r\nblowing and tossing the plumy young pines.\r\n\r\n“So it is _you_, young man, with whom I have been wrestling here under\r\nthe moon of the only God!” she said in a strange little voice, all\r\nvibrant and metallic with menacing laughter.\r\n\r\n“It is I, Keuke Mongol,” replied the young man in white, tranquilly;\r\nyet his words came as though he were tired and out of breath, and the\r\nhand he raised to touch his small black moustache trembled as if from\r\nphysical exhaustion.\r\n\r\n“Yarghouz!” she exclaimed. “Why did I not know you there on the golf\r\nlinks, Assassin of the Seventh Tower? And why do you come here with\r\nyour shroud over your arm and hidden under it, in your right hand, a\r\nflask full of death?”\r\n\r\nHe said, smiling:\r\n\r\n“I come because you are to die, Heavenly-Azure Eyes. I bring you your\r\nshroud.” And he moved warily westward around the open circle of young\r\npines.\r\n\r\nInstantly the girl flung her right arm straight upward.\r\n\r\n“Yarghouz!”\r\n\r\n“I hear thee, Heavenly Azure.”\r\n\r\n“Another step to the west and I shatter thy flask of gas.”\r\n\r\n“With what?” he demanded; but stood discreetly motionless.\r\n\r\n“With what I grasp in an empty palm. Thou knowest, Yarghouz.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard,” he said with smiling uncertainty, “but to hear of force\r\nthat can be hurled out of an empty palm is one thing, and to see it and\r\nfeel it is another. I think you lie, Heavenly Azure.”\r\n\r\n“So thought Gutchlug. And died of a yellow snake.”\r\n\r\nThe young man seemed to reflect. Then he looked up at her in his frank,\r\nsmiling way.\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou listen, Heavenly Eyes?”\r\n\r\n“I hear thee, Yarghouz.”\r\n\r\n“Listen then, Keuke Mongol. Take life from us as we offer it. Life is\r\nsweet. Erlik, like a spider, waits in darkness for lost souls that\r\nflutter to his net.”\r\n\r\n“You think my soul was lost there in the temple, Yarghouz?”\r\n\r\n“Unutterably lost, little temple girl of Yian. Therefore, live. Take\r\nlife as a gift!”\r\n\r\n“Whose gift?”\r\n\r\n“Sanang’s.”\r\n\r\n“It is written,” she said gravely, “that we belong to God and we return\r\nto him. Now then, Yezidee, do your duty as I do mine! Kai!”\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the formula always uttered by the sect of Assassins\r\nwhen about to do murder, the young man started and shrank back. The\r\nwest wind blew fresh in his startled eyes.\r\n\r\n“Sorceress,” he said less firmly, “you leave your Yiort to come all\r\nalone into this forest and seek me. Why then have you come, if not to\r\nsubmit!—if not to take the gift of life—if not to turn away from your\r\nseducers who are hunting me, and who have corrupted you?”\r\n\r\n“Yarghouz, I come to slay you,” she said quietly.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the man snarled at her, flung the shroud at her feet, and\r\ncrept deliberately to the left.\r\n\r\n“Be careful!” she cried sharply; “look what you’re about! Stand still,\r\nson of a dog! May your mother bewail your death!”\r\n\r\nYarghouz edged toward the west, clasping in his right hand the flask of\r\ngas.\r\n\r\n“Sorceress,” he laughed, “a witch of Thibet prophesied with a drum that\r\nthe three purities, the nine perfections, and the nine times nine\r\nfelicities shall be lodged in him who slays the treacherous temple\r\ngirl, Keuke Mongol! There is more magic in this bottle which I grasp\r\nthan in thy mind and body. Heavenly Eyes! I pray God to be merciful to\r\nthis soul I send to Erlik!”\r\n\r\nAll the time he was advancing, edging cautiously around the circle of\r\nlittle plumy pines; and already the wind struck his left cheek.\r\n\r\n“Yarghouz Khan!” cried the girl in her clear voice. “Take up your\r\nshroud and repeat the fatha!”\r\n\r\n“Backward!” laughed the young man, “—as do you, Keuke Mongol!”\r\n\r\n“Heretic!” she retorted. “Do you also refuse to name the ten Imaums in\r\nyour prayers? Dog! Toad! Spittle of Erlik! May all your cattle die and\r\nall your horses take the glanders and all your dogs the mange!”\r\n\r\n“Silence, sorceress!” he shouted, pale with fear and fury. “Witch! Mud\r\nworm! May Erlik seize you! May your skin be covered with putrefying\r\nsores! May all the demons torment you! May God remember you in hell!”\r\n\r\n“Yarghouz! Stand still!”\r\n\r\n“Is your word then the Rampart of Gog and Magog, you young witch of\r\nYian, that a Khan of the Seventh Tower need fear you!” he sneered,\r\nstealing stealthily westward through the feathery pines.\r\n\r\n“I give thee thy last chance, Yarghouz Khan,” she said in an excited\r\nvoice that trembled. “Recite thy prayer naming the ten, because with\r\ntheir holy names upon thy lips thou mayest escape damnation. For I am\r\nhere to slay thee, Yarghouz! Take up thy shroud and pray!”\r\n\r\nThe young man felt the west wind at the back of his left ear. Then he\r\nbegan to laugh.\r\n\r\n“Heavenly Eyes,” he said, “thy end is come—together with the two police\r\nwho hide in the pines yonder behind thee! Behold the bottle magic of\r\nYarghouz Khan!”\r\n\r\nAnd he lifted the glass flask in the moonlight as though he were about\r\nto smash it at her feet.\r\n\r\nThen a terrible thing occurred. The entire flask glowed red hot in his\r\ngrasp; and the man screamed and strove convulsively to fling the\r\nbottle; but it stuck to his hand, melted into the smoking flesh.\r\n\r\nThen he screamed again—or tried to—but his entire lower jaw came off\r\nand he stood there with the awful orifice gaping in the\r\nmoonlight—stood, reeled a moment—and then—and _then_—his whole face\r\nslid off, leaving nothing but a bony mask out of which burst shriek\r\nafter shriek——\r\n\r\nKeuke Mongol had fainted dead away. Cleves took her into his arms.\r\n\r\nRecklow, trembling and deathly white, went over to the thing that lay\r\namong the young pines and forced himself to bend over it.\r\n\r\nThe glass flask still stuck to one charred hand, but it was no longer\r\nhot. And Recklow rolled the unspeakable thing into the white shroud and\r\npushed it into the swamp.\r\n\r\nAn evil ooze took it, slowly sucked it under and engulfed it. A few\r\nstinking bubbles broke.\r\n\r\nRecklow went back to the little glade among the pines.\r\n\r\nA young girl lay sobbing convulsively in her husband’s arms, asking\r\nGod’s pardon and his for the justice she had done upon an enemy of all\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nAT THE RITZ\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Victor Cleves telegraphed from St. Augustine to Washington that he\r\nand his wife were on their way North, and that they desired to see John\r\nRecklow as soon as they arrived, John Recklow remarked that he knew of\r\nno place as private as a public one. And he came on to New York and\r\nestablished himself at the Ritz, rather regally.\r\n\r\nTo dine with him that evening were two volunteer agents of the United\r\nStates Secret Service, _ZB-303_, otherwise James Benton, a fashionable\r\narchitect; and _XYL-371_, Alexander Selden, sometime junior partner in\r\nthe house of Milwin, Selden & Co.\r\n\r\nA single lamp was burning in the white-and-rose rococo room. Under its\r\nveiled glow these three men sat conversing in guarded voices over\r\ncoffee and cigars, awaiting the advent of _53-6-26_, otherwise Victor\r\nCleves, recently Professor of Ornithology at Cambridge; and his young\r\nwife, Tressa, known officially as _V-69_.\r\n\r\n“Did the trip South do Mrs. Cleves any good?” inquired Benton.\r\n\r\n“Some,” said Recklow. “When Selden and I saw her she was getting\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that affair of Yarghouz upset her pretty thoroughly.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” Recklow tossed his cigar into the fireplace and produced a pipe.\r\n“Victor Cleves upsets her more,” he remarked.\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Benton, astonished.\r\n\r\n“She’s beginning to fall in love with him and doesn’t know what’s the\r\nmatter with her,” replied the elder man drily. “Selden noticed it,\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\nBenton looked immensely surprised. “I supposed,” he said, “that she and\r\nCleves considered the marriage to be merely a temporary necessity. I\r\ndidn’t imagine that they cared for each other.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t suppose they did at first,” said Selden. “But I think she’s\r\ninterested in Victor. And I don’t see how he can help falling in love\r\nwith her, because she’s a very beautiful thing to gaze on, and a most\r\nengaging one to talk to.”\r\n\r\n“She’s about the prettiest girl I ever saw,” admitted Benton, “and\r\nabout the cleverest. All the same——”\r\n\r\n“All the same—_what_?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mrs. Cleves has her drawbacks, you know—as a real wife, I mean.”\r\n\r\nRecklow said: “There is a fixed idea in Cleves’s head that Tressa Norne\r\nmarried him as a last resort, which is true. But he’ll never believe\r\nshe’s changed her ideas in regard to him unless she herself enlightens\r\nhim. And the girl is too shy to do that. Besides, she believes the same\r\nthing of him. There’s a mess for you!”\r\n\r\nRecklow filled his pipe carefully.\r\n\r\n“In addition,” he went on, “Mrs. Cleves has another and very terrible\r\nfixed idea in her charming head, and that is that she really did lose\r\nher soul among those damned Yezidees. She believes that Cleves, though\r\nkind to her, considers her merely as something uncanny—something to\r\nendure until this Yezidee campaign is ended and she is safe from\r\nassassination.”\r\n\r\nBenton said: “After all, and in spite of all her loveliness, I myself\r\nshould not feel entirely comfortable with such a girl for a real wife.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” demanded Recklow.\r\n\r\n“Well—good heavens, John!—those uncanny things she does—her rather\r\nterrifying psychic knowledge and ability—make a man more or less\r\nuneasy.” He laughed without mirth.\r\n\r\n“For example,” he added, “I never was nervous in any physical crisis;\r\nbut since I’ve met Tressa Norne—to be frank—I’m not any too comfortable\r\nin my mind when I remember Gutchlug and Sanang and Albert Feke and that\r\ndirty reptile Yarghouz—and when I recollect _how that girl dealt with\r\nthem_! Good God, John, I’m not a coward, I hope, but that sort of thing\r\nworries me!”\r\n\r\nRecklow lighted his pipe. He said: “In the Government’s campaign\r\nagainst these eight foreigners who have begun a psychic campaign\r\nagainst the unsuspicious people of this decent Republic, with the\r\npurpose of surprising, overpowering and enslaving the minds of mankind\r\nby a misuse of psychic power, we agents of the Secret Service are\r\nslowly gaining the upper hand.\r\n\r\n“In this battle of minds we are gaining a victory. But we are winning\r\nsolely and alone through the psychic ability and the loyalty and\r\ncourage of a young girl who, through tragedy of circumstances, spent\r\nthe years of her girlhood in the infamous Yezidee temple at Yian, and\r\nwho learned from the devil-worshipers themselves not only this\r\nso-called magic of the Mongol sorcerers, but also how to meet its\r\npsychic menace and defeat it.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at Benton, shrugged:\r\n\r\n“If you and if Cleves really feel the slightest repugnance toward the\r\nstrange psychic ability of this brave and generous girl, I for one do\r\nnot share it.”\r\n\r\nBenton reddened: “It isn’t exactly repugnance——” But Recklow\r\ninterrupted sharply:\r\n\r\n“Do you realise, Benton, what she’s already accomplished for us in our\r\nsecret battle against Bolshevism?—against the very powers of hell\r\nitself, led by these Mongol sorcerers?\r\n\r\n“Of the Eight Assassins—or Sheiks-el-Djebel—who came to the United\r\nStates to wield the dreadful weapon of psychic power against the minds\r\nof our people, and to pervert them and destroy all civilisation,—of the\r\nEight Chief Assassins of the Eight Towers, this girl already has\r\ndiscovered and identified four,—Sanang, Gutchlug, Albert Feke, and\r\nYarghouz; and she has destroyed the last three.”\r\n\r\nHe sat calmly enjoying his pipe for a few moments’ silence, then:\r\n\r\n“Five of this sect of Assassins remain—five sly, murderous, psychic\r\nadepts who call themselves sorcerers. Except for Prince Sanang, I do\r\nnot know who these other four men may be. I haven’t a notion. Nor have\r\nyou. Nor do I believe that with all the resources of the United States\r\nSecret Service we ever should be able to discover these four\r\nSheiks-el-Djebel except for the astounding spiritual courage and\r\npsychic experience of the young wife of Victor Cleves.”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment Selden nodded. “That is quite true,” he said simply. “We\r\nare utterly helpless against unknown psychic forces. And I, for one,\r\nfeel no repugnance toward what Mrs. Cleves has done for all mankind and\r\nin the name of God.”\r\n\r\n“She’s a brave girl,” muttered Benton, “but it’s terrible to possess\r\nsuch knowledge and horrible to use it.”\r\n\r\nRecklow said: “The horror of it nearly killed the girl herself. Have\r\nyou any idea how she must suffer by being forced to employ such\r\nterrific knowledge? by being driven to use it to combat this menace of\r\nhell? Can you imagine what this charming, sensitive, tragic young\r\ncreature must feel when, with powers natural to her but unfamiliar to\r\nus, she destroys with her own mind and will-power demons in human shape\r\nwho are about to destroy her?\r\n\r\n“Talk of nerve! Talk of abnegation! Talk of perfect loyalty and\r\ncourage! There is more than these in Tressa Cleves. There is that\r\ndauntless bravery which faces worse than physical death. Because the\r\nchild still believes that her soul is damned for whatever happened to\r\nher in the Yezidee temple; and that when these Yezidees succeed in\r\nkilling her body, Erlik will surely seize the soul that leaves it.”\r\n\r\nThere was a knocking at the door. Benton got up and opened it. Victor\r\nCleves came in with his young wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nTressa Cleves seemed to have grown since she had been away. Taller, a\r\ntrifle paler, yet without even the subtlest hint of that charming\r\nmaturity which the young and happily married woman invariably wears,\r\nher virginal allure now verged vaguely on the delicate edges of\r\nausterity.\r\n\r\nCleves, sunburnt and vigorous, looked older, somehow—far less\r\nboyish—and he seemed more silent than when, nearly seven months before,\r\nhe had been assigned to the case of Tressa Norne.\r\n\r\nRecklow, Selden and Benton greeted them warmly; to each in turn Tressa\r\ngave her narrow, sun-tanned hand. Recklow led her to a seat. A servant\r\ncame with iced fruit juice and little cakes and cigarettes.\r\n\r\nConversation, aimless and general, fulfilling formalities, gradually\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nA full June moon stared through the open windows—searching for the\r\ntraditional bride, perhaps—and its light silvered a pale and lovely\r\nfigure that might possibly have passed for the pretty ghost of a bride,\r\nbut not for any girl who had married because she was loved.\r\n\r\nRecklow broke the momentary silence, bluntly:\r\n\r\n“Have you anything to report, Cleves?”\r\n\r\nThe young fellow hesitated:\r\n\r\n“My wife has, I believe.”\r\n\r\nThe others turned to her. She seemed, for a moment, to shrink back in\r\nher chair, and, as her eyes involuntarily sought her husband, there was\r\nin them a vague and troubled appeal.\r\n\r\nCleves said in a sombre voice: “I need scarcely remind you how deeply\r\ndistasteful this entire and accursed business is to my wife. But she is\r\ngoing to see it through, whatever the cost. And we four men understand\r\nsomething of what it has cost her—is costing her—in violence to her\r\nevery instinct.”\r\n\r\n“We honour her the more,” said Recklow quietly.\r\n\r\n“We couldn’t honour her too much,” said Cleves.\r\n\r\nA slight colour came into Tressa’s face; she bent her head, but Recklow\r\nsaw her eyes steal sideways toward her husband.\r\n\r\nStill bowed a little in her chair, she seemed to reflect for a while\r\nconcerning what she had to say; then, looking up at John Recklow:\r\n\r\n“I saw Sanang.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens! Where?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“I—don’t—know.”\r\n\r\nCleves, flushing with embarrassment, explained: “She saw him\r\nclairvoyantly. She was lying in the hammock. You remember I had a\r\ntrained nurse for her after—what happened in Orchid Lodge.”\r\n\r\nTressa looked miserably at Recklow,—dumbly, for a moment. Then her lips\r\nunclosed.\r\n\r\n“I saw Prince Sanang,” she repeated. “He was near the sea. There were\r\nrocks—cottages on cliffs—and very brilliant flowers in tiny,\r\npocket-like gardens.\r\n\r\n“Sanang was walking on the cliffs with another man. There were forests,\r\ninland.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know who the other man was?” asked Recklow gently.\r\n\r\n“Yes. He was one of the Eight. I recognised him. When I was a girl he\r\ncame once to the Temple of Yian, all alone, and spread his shroud on\r\nthe pink marble steps. And we temple girls mocked him and threw\r\nstemless roses on the shroud, telling him they were human heads with\r\nwhich to grease his toug.”\r\n\r\nShe became excited and sat up straighter in her chair, and her strange\r\nlittle laughter rippled like a rill among pebbles.\r\n\r\n“I threw a big rose without a stem upon the shroud,” she exclaimed,\r\n“and I cried out, ‘Niaz!’ which means, ‘Courage,’ and I mocked him,\r\nsaying, ‘Djamouk Khagan,’ when he was only a Khan, of course; and I\r\nlaughed and rubbed one finger against the other, crying out, ‘Toug ia\r\nglachakho!’ which means, ‘The toug is anointed.’ And which was very\r\nimpudent of me, because Djamouk was a Sheik-el-Djebel and Khan of the\r\nFifth Tower, and entitled to a toug and to eight men and a Toughtchi.\r\nAnd it is a grave offence to mock at the anointing of a toug.”\r\n\r\nShe paused, breathless, her splendid azure eyes sparkling with the\r\nmemory of that girlish mischief. Then their brilliancy faded; she bit\r\nher lip and stole an uncertain glance at her husband.\r\n\r\nAnd after a pause she explained in a very subdued voice that the “Iagla\r\nmichi,” or action of “greasing the toug,” or standard, was done when a\r\nsevered human head taken in battle was cast at the foot of the lance\r\nshaft stuck upright in the ground.\r\n\r\n“You see,” she said sadly, “we temple girls, being already damned,\r\ncared little what we said, even to such a terrible man as Djamouk Khan.\r\nAnd even had the ghost of old Tchinguiz Khagan himself come to the\r\ntemple and looked at us out of his tawny eyes, I think we might have\r\ndone something saucy.”\r\n\r\nTressa’s pretty face was spiritless, now; she leaned back in her\r\narmchair and they heard an unconscious sigh escape her.\r\n\r\n“Ai-ya! Ai-ya!” she murmured to herself, “what crazy things we did on\r\nthe rose-marble steps, Yulun and I, so long—so long ago.”\r\n\r\nCleves got up and went over to stand beside his wife’s chair.\r\n\r\n“What happened is this,” he said heavily. “During my wife’s\r\nconvalescence after that Yarghouz affair, she found herself, at a\r\ncertain moment, clairvoyant. And she thought she saw—she _did_\r\nsee—Sanang, and an Asiatic she recognised as being one of the chiefs of\r\nthe Assassins sect, whose name is Djamouk.\r\n\r\n“But, except that it was somewhere near the sea—some summer colony\r\nprobably on the Atlantic coast—she does not know where this pair of\r\njailbirds roost. And this is what we have come here to report.”\r\n\r\nBenton, politely appalled, tried not to look incredulous. But it was\r\nevident that Selden and Recklow had no doubts.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Recklow calmly, “the thing to do is for you and your\r\nwife to try to find this place she saw.”\r\n\r\n“Make a tour of all such ocean-side resorts until Mrs. Cleves\r\nrecognises the place she saw,” added Selden. And to Recklow he added:\r\n“I believe there are several perfectly genuine cases on record where\r\nclairvoyants have aided the police.”\r\n\r\n“Several authentic cases,” said Recklow quietly. But Benton’s face was\r\na study.\r\n\r\nTressa looked up at her husband. He dropped his hand reassuringly on\r\nher shoulder and nodded with a slight smile.\r\n\r\n“There—there was something else,” she said with considerable\r\nhesitation—“something not quite in line of duty—perhaps——”\r\n\r\n“It seems to concern Benton,” added Cleves, smiling.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” inquired Selden, smiling also as Benton’s features froze\r\nto a mask.\r\n\r\n“Let me tell you, first,” interrupted Cleves, “that my wife’s psychic\r\nability and skill can make me visualise and actually see scenes and\r\npeople which, God knows, I never before laid eyes upon, but which she\r\nhas both seen and known.\r\n\r\n“And one morning, in Florida, I asked her to do something\r\nstrange—something of that sort to amuse me—and we were sitting on the\r\nsteps of our cottage—you know, the old club-house at Orchid!—and the\r\nfirst I knew I saw, in the mist on the St. Johns, a Chinese bridge\r\nhumped up over that very commonplace stream, and thousands of people\r\npassing over it,—and a city beyond—the town of Yian, Tressa tells\r\nme,—and I heard the Buddhist bells and the big temple gong and the\r\nnoises in streets and on the water——”\r\n\r\nHe was becoming considerably excited at the memory, and his lean face\r\nreddened and he gesticulated as he spoke:\r\n\r\n“It was astounding, Recklow! There was that bridge, and all those\r\npeople moving over it; and the city beyond, and the boats and shipping,\r\nand the vast murmur of multitudes.... And then, there on the bridge\r\ncrossing toward Yian, I saw a young girl, who turned and looked back at\r\nmy wife and laughed.”\r\n\r\n“And I told him it was Yulun,” said Tressa, simply.\r\n\r\n“A playfellow of my wife’s in Yian,” explained Cleves. “But if she were\r\nreally Chinese she didn’t look like what are my own notions of a\r\nChinese girl.”\r\n\r\n“Yulun came from Black China,” said Mrs. Cleves. “I taught her English.\r\nI loved her dearly. I was her most intimate friend in Yian.”\r\n\r\nThere ensued a silence, broken presently by Benton; and:\r\n\r\n“Where do I appear in this?” he asked stiffly.\r\n\r\nTressa’s smile was odd; she looked at Selden and said:\r\n\r\n“When I was convalescent I was lonely.... I made _the effort_ one\r\nevening. And I found Yulun. And again she was on a bridge. But she was\r\ndressed as I am. And the bridge was one of those great, horrible steel\r\nmonsters that sprawl across the East River. And I was astonished, and I\r\nsaid, ‘Yulun, darling, are you really here in America and in New York,\r\nor has a demon tangled the threads of thought to mock my mind in\r\nillness?’\r\n\r\n“Then Yulun looked very sorrowfully at me and wrote in Arabic\r\ncharacters, in the air, the name of our enemy who once came to the Lake\r\nof Ghosts for love of her—Yaddin-ed-Din, Tougtchi to Djamouk the\r\nFox.... And who went his way again amid our scornful laughter.... He is\r\na demon. And he was tangling my thread of thought!”\r\n\r\nTressa became exceedingly animated once more. She rose and came swiftly\r\nto where Benton was standing.\r\n\r\n“And what do you think!” she said eagerly. “I said to her, ‘Yulun!\r\nYulun! Will you _make the effort_ and come to me if I _make the\r\neffort_? Will you come to me, beloved?’ And Yulun made ‘Yes,’ with her\r\nlips.”\r\n\r\nAfter a silence: “But—where do I come in?” inquired Benton, stiffly\r\nfearful of such matters.\r\n\r\n“You _came_ in.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“You came in the door while Yulun and I were talking.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“When you came to see me after I was better, and you and Mr. Selden\r\nwere going North with Mr. Recklow. Don’t you remember; I was lying in\r\nthe hammock in the moonlight, and Victor told you I was asleep?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course——”\r\n\r\n“I was not asleep. I had _made the effort_ and I was with Yulun.... I\r\ndid not know you were standing beside my hammock in the moonlight until\r\nYulun told me.... And _that_ is what I am to tell you; Yulun saw\r\nyou.... And Yulun has written it in Chinese, in Eighur characters and\r\nin Arabic,—tracing them with her forefinger in the air—that Yulun,\r\nloveliest in Yian, flame-slender and very white, has seen her heart,\r\nlike a pink pearl afire, burning between your august hands.”\r\n\r\n“My hands!” exclaimed Benton, very red.\r\n\r\nThere fell an odd silence. Nobody laughed.\r\n\r\nTressa came nearer to Benton, wistful, uncertain, shy.\r\n\r\n“Would you care to see Yulun?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Well—no,” he said, startled. “I—I shall not deny that such things\r\nworry me a lot, Mrs. Cleves. I’m a—an Episcopalian.”\r\n\r\nThe tension released, Selden was the first to laugh.\r\n\r\n“There’s no use blinking the truth,” he said; “we’re up against\r\nsomething absolutely new. Of course, it isn’t magic. It can, of course,\r\nbe explained by natural laws about which we happen to know nothing at\r\npresent.”\r\n\r\nRecklow nodded. “What do we know about the human mind? It has been\r\nproven that no thought can originate within that mass of convoluted\r\nphysical matter called the brain. It has been proven that _something\r\noutside_ the brain originates thought and uses the brain as a vehicle\r\nto incubate it. What do we know about thought?”\r\n\r\nSelden, much interested, sat cogitating and looking at Mrs. Cleves. But\r\nBenton, still flushed and evidently nervous, sat staring out of the\r\nwindow at the full moon, and twisting an unlighted cigarette to shreds.\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you tell Benton when the thing occurred down there at\r\nOrchid Lodge, the night we called to say good-bye?” asked Selden,\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\nTressa gave him a distressed smile: “I was afraid he wouldn’t believe\r\nme. And I was afraid that you and Mr. Recklow, even if you believed it,\r\nmight not like—like me any the better for—for being clairvoyant.”\r\n\r\nRecklow came over, bent his handsome grey head, and kissed her hand.\r\n\r\n“I never liked any woman better, nor respected any woman as deeply,” he\r\nsaid. And, lifting his head, he saw tears sparkling in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” he said in a low voice, and his firm hand closed over the\r\nslim fingers he had kissed.\r\n\r\nBenton got up from his chair, went to the window, turned shortly and\r\ncame over to Tressa.\r\n\r\n“You’re braver than I ever could learn to be,” he said shortly. “I ask\r\nyour pardon if I seem sceptical. I’m more worried than incredulous.\r\nThere’s something born in me—part of me—that shrinks from anything that\r\nupsets my orthodox belief in the future life. But—if you wish me to see\r\nthis—this girl—Yulun—it’s quite all right.”\r\n\r\nShe said softly, and with gentle wonder: “I know of nothing that could\r\nupset your belief, Mr. Benton. There is only one God. And if Mahomet be\r\nHis prophet, or if he be Lord Buddha, or if your Lord Christ be\r\nvice-regent to the Most High, I do not know. All I know is that God is\r\nGod, and that He prevailed over Satan who was stoned. And that in\r\nParadise is eternal life, and in hell demons hide where dwells Erlik,\r\nPrince of Darkness.”\r\n\r\nBenton, silent and secretly aghast at her theology, said nothing.\r\nRecklow pleasantly but seriously denied that Satan and his demons were\r\nactual and concrete creatures.\r\n\r\nAgain Cleves’s hand fell lightly on his wife’s shoulder, in a careless\r\ngesture of reassurance. And, to Benton, “No soul is ever lost,” he\r\nsaid, calmly. “I don’t exactly know how that agrees with your\r\northodoxy, Benton. But it is surely so.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know myself,” said Benton. “I hope it’s so.” He looked at\r\nTressa a moment and then blurted out: “Anyway, if ever there was a soul\r\nin God’s keeping and guarded by His angels, it’s your wife’s!”\r\n\r\n“That also is true,” said Cleves quietly.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” remarked Recklow carelessly, “I’ve arranged to have you\r\nstop at the Ritz while you’re in town, Mrs. Cleves. You and your\r\nhusband are to occupy the apartment adjoining this. Where is your\r\nluggage, Victor?”\r\n\r\n“In our apartment.”\r\n\r\n“That won’t do,” said Recklow decisively. “Telephone for it.”\r\n\r\nCleves went to the telephone, but Recklow took the instrument out of\r\nhis hand and called the number. The voice of one of his own agents\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nCleves was standing alone by the open window when Recklow hung up the\r\ntelephone. Tressa, on the sofa, had been whispering with Benton.\r\nSelden, looking over the evening paper by the rose-shaded lamp, glanced\r\nup as Recklow went over to Cleves.\r\n\r\n“Victor,” he said, “your man has been murdered. His throat was cut; his\r\nhead was severed completely. Your luggage has been ransacked and so has\r\nyour apartment. Three of my men are in possession, and the local police\r\nseem to comprehend the necessity of keeping the matter out of the\r\nnewspapers. What was in your baggage?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” said Cleves, ghastly pale.\r\n\r\n“All right. We’ll have your effects packed up again and brought over\r\nhere. Are you going to tell your wife?”\r\n\r\nCleves, still deathly pale, cast a swift glance toward her. She sat on\r\nthe sofa in animated conversation with Benton. She laughed once, and\r\nBenton smiled at what she was saying.\r\n\r\n“Is there any need to tell her, Recklow?”\r\n\r\n“Not for a while, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“All right. I suppose the Yezidees are responsible for this horrible\r\nbusiness.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. Your poor servant’s head lay at the foot of a curtain-pole\r\nwhich had been placed upright between two chairs. On the pole were tied\r\nthree tufts of hair from the dead man’s head. The pole had been rubbed\r\nwith blood.”\r\n\r\n“That’s Mongol custom,” muttered Cleves. “They made a toug and\r\n‘greased’ it!—the murderous devils!”\r\n\r\n“They did more. They left at the foot of your bed and at the foot of\r\nyour wife’s bed two white sheets. And a knife lay in the centre of each\r\nsheet. That, of course, is the symbol of the Sect of Assassins.”\r\n\r\nCleves nodded. His body, as he leaned there on the window sill in the\r\nmoonlight, trembled. But his face had grown dark with rage.\r\n\r\n“If I could—could only get my hands on one of them,” he whispered\r\nhoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Be careful. Don’t wear a face like that. Your wife is looking at us,”\r\nmurmured Recklow.\r\n\r\nWith an effort Cleves raised his head and smiled across the room at his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n“Our luggage will be sent over shortly,” he said. “If you’re tired,\r\nwe’ll say good-night.”\r\n\r\nSo she rose and the three men came to make their adieux and pay their\r\ncompliments and devoirs. Then, with a smile that seemed almost happy,\r\nshe went into her own apartment on her husband’s arm.\r\n\r\nCleves and his wife had connecting bedrooms and a sitting-room between.\r\nHere they paused for a moment before the always formal ceremony of\r\nleave-taking at night. There were roses on the centre table. Tressa\r\ndropped one hand on the table and bent over the flowers.\r\n\r\n“They seem so friendly,” she said under her breath.\r\n\r\nHe thought she meant that she found even in flowers a refuge from the\r\nsolitude of a loveless marriage.\r\n\r\nHe said quietly: “I think you will find the world very friendly, if you\r\nwish.” But she shook her head, looking at the roses.\r\n\r\nFinally he said good-night and she extended her hand, and he took it\r\nformally.\r\n\r\nThen their hands fell away. Tressa turned and went toward her bedroom.\r\nAt the door she stopped, turned slowly.\r\n\r\n“What shall I do about Yulun?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“What is there to do? Yulun is in China.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, her body is.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that the rest of her—whatever it is—could come here?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course.”\r\n\r\n“So that Benton could see her?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Could he see her just as she is? Her face and figure—clothes and\r\neverything?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Would she seem real or like a ghost—spirit—whatever you choose to call\r\nsuch things?”\r\n\r\nTressa smiled. “She’d be exactly as real as you or I, Victor. She’d\r\nseem like anybody else.”\r\n\r\n“That’s astonishing,” he muttered. “Could Benton hear her speak?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Talk to her?”\r\n\r\nTressa laughed: “Of course. If Yulun should _make the effort_ she could\r\nleave her body as easily as she undresses herself. It is no more\r\ndifficult to divest one’s self of one’s body than it is to put off one\r\ngarment and put on another.... And, somehow, I think Yulun will do it\r\nto-night.”\r\n\r\n“Come _here_?”\r\n\r\n“It would be like her.” Tressa laughed. “Isn’t it odd that she should\r\nhave become so enamoured of Mr. Benton—just seeing him there in the\r\nmoonlight that night at Orchid Lodge?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment the smile curved her lips, then the shadow fell again\r\nacross her eyes, veiling them in that strange and lovely way which\r\nCleves knew so well; and he looked into her impenetrable eyes in\r\ntroubled silence.\r\n\r\n“Victor,” she said in a low voice, “were you afraid to tell me that\r\nyour man had been murdered?”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment: “You always know everything,” he said unsteadily. “When\r\ndid you learn it?”\r\n\r\n“Just before Mr. Recklow told you.”\r\n\r\n“How did you learn it, Tressa?”\r\n\r\n“I looked into our apartment.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“While you were telephoning.”\r\n\r\n“You mean you looked into our rooms from _here_?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, clairvoyantly.”\r\n\r\n“What did you see?”\r\n\r\n“The Iaglamichi!” she said with a shudder. “Kai! The Toug of Djamouk is\r\nanointed at last!”\r\n\r\n“Is that the beast of a Mongol who did this murder?”\r\n\r\n“Djamouk and Prince Sanang planned it,” she said, trembling a little.\r\n“But that butchery was Yaddin’s work, I think. Kai! The work of\r\nYaddined-Din, Tougtchi to Djamouk the Fox!”\r\n\r\nThey stood confronting each other, the length of the sitting-room\r\nbetween them. And after the silence had lasted a full minute Cleves\r\nreddened and said: “I am going to sleep on the couch at the foot of\r\nyour bed, Tressa.”\r\n\r\nHis young wife reddened too.\r\n\r\nHe said: “This affair has thoroughly scared me. I can’t let you sleep\r\nout of my sight.”\r\n\r\n“I am quite safe. And you would have an uncomfortable night,” she\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\n“Do you mind if I sleep on the couch, Tressa?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Will you call me when you are ready?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nShe went into her bedroom and closed the door.\r\n\r\nWhen he was ready he slipped a pistol into the pocket of his\r\ndressing-gown, belted it over his pyjamas, and walked into the\r\nsitting-room. His wife called him presently, and he went in. Her\r\nnight-lamp was burning and she extended her hand to extinguish it.\r\n\r\n“Could you sleep if it burns?” he asked bluntly.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then let it burn. This business has got on my nerves,” he muttered.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other in an expressionless way. Both really\r\nunderstood how useless was this symbol of protection—this man the girl\r\ncalled husband;—how utterly useless his physical strength, and the\r\npistol sagging in the pocket of his dressing-gown. Both understood that\r\nthe only real protection to be looked for must come from her—from the\r\ngifted and guardian mind of this young girl who lay there looking at\r\nhim from the pillows.\r\n\r\n“Good-night,” he said, flushing; “I’ll do my best. But only one of\r\nGod’s envoys, like you, knows how to do battle with things that come\r\nout of hell.”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment’s silence she said in a colourless voice: “I wish you’d\r\nlie down on the bed.”\r\n\r\n“Had you rather I did?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nSo he went slowly to the bed, placed his pistol under the pillow, drew\r\nhis dressing-gown around him, and lay down.\r\n\r\nAfter he had lain unstirring for half an hour: “Try to sleep, Tressa,”\r\nhe said, without turning his head.\r\n\r\n“Can’t you seem to sleep, Victor?” she asked. And he heard her turn her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I help you?”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean use hypnosis—the power of suggestion—on me?”\r\n\r\n“No. I can help you to sleep very gently. I can make you very\r\ndrowsy.... You are drowsy now.... You are very close to the edge of\r\nsleep.... Sleep, dear.... Sleep, easily, naturally, confidently as a\r\ntired boy.... You are sleeping, ... deeply ... sweetly ... my dear ...\r\nmy dear, dear husband.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nYULUN THE BELOVED\r\n\r\n\r\nCleves opened his eyes. He was lying on his left side. In the pink glow\r\nof the night-lamp he saw his wife in her night-dress, seated sideways\r\non the farther edge of the bed, talking to a young girl.\r\n\r\nThe strange girl wore what appeared to be a chamber-robe of frail gold\r\ntissue that clung to her body and glittered as she moved. He had never\r\nbefore seen such a dress; but he had seen the girl; he recognised her\r\ninstantly as the girl he had seen turn to look back at Tressa as she\r\ncrossed the phantom bridge over that misty Florida river. And Cleves\r\ncomprehended that he was looking at Yulun.\r\n\r\nBut this charming young thing was no ghost, no astral projection. This\r\ngirl was warm, living, breathing flesh. The delicate scent of her\r\nstrange garments and of her hair, her very breath, was in the air of\r\nthe room. Her half-hushed but laughing voice was deliciously human; her\r\ndelicate little hands, caressing Tressa’s, were too eagerly real to\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nBoth talked at the same time, their animated voices mingling in the\r\nbreathless delight of the reunion. Their exclamations, enchanting\r\nlaughter, bubbling chatter, filled his ears. But not one word of what\r\nthey were saying to each other could he understand.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Tressa looked over her shoulder and met his astonished eyes.\r\n\r\n“Tokhta!” she exclaimed. “Yulun! My lord is awake!”\r\n\r\nYulun swung around swiftly on the edge of the bed and looked laughingly\r\nat Cleves. But when her red lips unclosed she spoke to Tressa: and,\r\n“Darling,” she said in English, “I think your dear lord remembers that\r\nhe saw me on the Bridge of Dreams. And heard the bells of Yian across\r\nthe mist.”\r\n\r\nTressa said, laughing at her husband: “This is Yulun, flame-slender,\r\nvery white, loveliest in Yian. On the rose-marble steps of the Yezidee\r\nTemple she flung a stemless rose upon Djamouk’s shroud, where he had\r\nspread it like a patch of snow in the sun.\r\n\r\n“And at the Lake of the Ghosts, where there is freedom to love, for\r\nthose who desire love, came Yaddin, Tougtchi to Djamouk the Fox, in\r\nsearch of love—and Yulun, flame-slim, and flower-white.... Tell my dear\r\nlord, Yulun!”\r\n\r\nYulun laughed at Cleves out of her dark eyes that slanted charmingly at\r\nthe corners.\r\n\r\n“Kai!” she cried softly, clapping her palms. “I took his roses and tore\r\nthem with my hands till their petals rained on him and their golden\r\nhearts were a powdery cloud floating across the water.\r\n\r\n“I said: ‘Even the damned do not mate with demons, my Tougtchi! So go\r\nto the devil, my Banneret, and may Erlik seize you!’”\r\n\r\nCleves, his ears ringing with the sweet confusion of their girlish\r\nlaughter, rose from his pillow, supporting himself on one arm.\r\n\r\n“You are Yulun. You are alive and real——” He looked at Tressa: “She is\r\nreal, isn’t she?” And, to Yulun: “Where do you come from?”\r\n\r\nThe girl replied seriously: “I come from Yian.” She turned to Tressa\r\nwith a dazzling smile: “Thou knowest, my heart’s gold, how it was I\r\ncame. Tell thy dear lord in thine own way, so that it shall be simple\r\nfor his understanding.... And now—because my visit is ending—I think\r\nthy dear lord should sleep. Bid him sleep, my heart’s gold!”\r\n\r\nAt that calm suggestion Cleves sat upright on the bed,—or attempted to.\r\nBut sank back gently on his pillow and met there a dark, delicious rush\r\nof drowsiness.\r\n\r\nHe made an effort—or tried to: the smooth, sweet tide of sleep swept\r\nover him to the eyelids, leaving him still and breathing evenly on his\r\npillow.\r\n\r\nThe two girls leaned over and looked down at him.\r\n\r\n“Thy dear lord,” murmured Yulun. “Does he love thee, rose-bud of Yian?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Tressa, under her breath.\r\n\r\n“Does he know thou art damned, heart of gold?”\r\n\r\n“He says no soul is ever really harmed,” whispered Tressa.\r\n\r\n“Kai! Has he never heard of the Slayer of Souls?” exclaimed Yulun\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\n“My lord maintains that neither the Assassin of Khorassan nor the\r\nSheiks-el-Djebel of the Eight Towers, nor their dark prince Erlik, can\r\nhave power over God to slay the human soul.”\r\n\r\n“Tokhta, Rose of Yian! Our souls were slain there in the Yezidee\r\ntemple.”\r\n\r\nTressa looked down at Cleves:\r\n\r\n“My dear lord says no,” she said under her breath.\r\n\r\n“And—Sanang?”\r\n\r\nTressa paled: “His mind and mine did battle. I tore my heart from his\r\ngrasp. I have laid it, bleeding, at my dear lord’s feet. Let God judge\r\nbetween us, Yulun.”\r\n\r\n“There was a day,” whispered Yulun, “when Prince Sanang went to the\r\nLake of the Ghosts.”\r\n\r\nTressa, very pallid, looked down at her sleeping husband. She said:\r\n\r\n“Prince Sanang came to the Lake of the Ghosts. The snow of the\r\ncherry-trees covered the young world.\r\n\r\n“The water was clear as sunlight; and the lake was afire with scarlet\r\ncarp.... Yulun—beloved—the nightingale sang all night long—all night\r\nlong.... Then I saw Sanang shining, all gold, in the moonlight.... May\r\nGod remember him in hell!”\r\n\r\n“May God remember him.”\r\n\r\n“Sanang Noïane. May he be accursed in the Namaz Ga!”\r\n\r\n“May he be tormented in Jehaunum!—Sanang, Slayer of Souls.”\r\n\r\nTressa leaned forward on the bed, stretched herself out, and laid her\r\nface gently across her husband’s feet, touching them with her lips.\r\n\r\nThen she straightened herself and sat up, supported by one hand, and\r\nlooking silently down at the sleeping man.\r\n\r\n“No soul shall die,” she said. “Niaz!”\r\n\r\n“Is it written?” asked Yulun, surprised.\r\n\r\n“My lord has said it.”\r\n\r\n“Allahou Ekber,” murmured Yulun; “thy lord is only a man.”\r\n\r\nTressa said: “Neither the Tekbir nor the fatha, nor the warning of\r\nKhidr, nor the Yacaz of the Khagan, nor even the prayers of the Ten\r\nImaums are of any value to me unless my dear lord confirms the truth of\r\nthem with his own lips.”\r\n\r\n“And Erlik? Is he nothing, then?”\r\n\r\n“Erlik!” repeated Tressa insolently. “Who is Erlik but the servant of\r\nSatan who was stoned?”\r\n\r\nHer beautiful, angry lips were suddenly distorted; her blue eyes\r\nblazed. Then she spat, her mouth still tremulous with hatred. She said\r\nin a voice shaking with rage:\r\n\r\n“Yulun, beloved! Listen attentively. I have slain two of the Slayers of\r\nthe Eight Towers. With God’s help I shall slay them all—all!—Djamouk,\r\nYaddin, Arrak Sou-Sou—all!—every one!—Tiyang Khan, Togrul,—all shall I\r\nslay, even to the last one among them!”\r\n\r\n“_Sanang, also?_”\r\n\r\n“I leave him to God. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of\r\nthe living God!”\r\n\r\nYulun calmly paraphrased the cant phrase of the Assassins: “For it is\r\nwritten that we belong to God and we return to Him. Heart of gold, I\r\nshall execute my duty!”\r\n\r\nThen Yulun slipped from the edge of the bed to the floor, and stood\r\nthere looking oddly at Tressa, her eyes rain-bright as though choking\r\nback tears—or laughter.\r\n\r\n“Heart of a rose,” she said in a suppressed voice, “my time is nearly\r\nended.... So.... I go to the chamber of this strange young man who\r\nholds my soul like a pearl afire between his hands.... I think it it\r\nwritten that I shall love him.”\r\n\r\nTressa rose also and placed her lips close to Yulun’s ear: “His name,\r\nbeloved, is Benton. His room is on this floor. Shall we _make the\r\neffort_ together?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Yulun. “Lay your body down upon the bed beside your lord\r\nwho sleeps so deeply.... And now stretch out.... And fold both\r\nhands.... And now put off thy body like a silken garment.... So! And\r\nleave it there beside thy lord, asleep.”\r\n\r\nThey stood together for a moment, shining like dewy shapes of tall\r\nflowers, whispering and laughing together in the soft glow of the night\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\nCleves slept on, unstirring. There was the white and sleeping figure of\r\nhis wife lying on the bed beside him.\r\n\r\nBut Tressa and Yulun were already melting away between the wall and the\r\nconfused rosy radiance of the lamp.\r\n\r\nBenton, in night attire and chamber-robe belted in, fresh from his bath\r\nand still drying his curly hair on a rough towel, wandered back into\r\nhis bedroom.\r\n\r\nWhen his short, bright hair was dry, he lighted a cigarette, took the\r\nautomatic from his dresser, examined the clip, and shoved it under his\r\npillow.\r\n\r\nThen he picked up the little leather-bound Testament, seated himself,\r\nand opened it. And read tranquilly while his cigarette burned.\r\n\r\nWhen he was ready he turned out the ceiling light, leaving only the\r\nnight lamp lighted. Then he knelt beside his bed,—a custom surviving\r\nthe nursery period,—and rested his forehead against his folded hands.\r\n\r\nThen, as he prayed, something snapped the thread of prayer as though\r\nsomebody had spoken aloud in the still room; and, like one who has been\r\nsuddenly interrupted, he opened his eyes and looked around and upward.\r\n\r\nThe silent shock of her presence passed presently. He got up from his\r\nknees, looking at her all the while.\r\n\r\n“You are Yulun,” he said very calmly.\r\n\r\nThe girl flushed brightly and rested one hand on the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember in the moonlight where you walked along the hedge of\r\nwhite hibiscus and oleander—that night you said good-bye to Tressa in\r\nthe South?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Twice,” she said, laughing, “you stopped to peer at the blossoms in\r\nthe moonlight.”\r\n\r\n“I thought I saw a face among them.”\r\n\r\n“You were not sure whether it was flowers or a girl’s face looking at\r\nyou from the blossoming hedge of white hibiscus,” said Yulun.\r\n\r\n“I know now,” he said in an odd, still voice, unlike his own.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it was I,” she murmured. And of a sudden the girl dropped to her\r\nknees without a sound and laid her head on the velvet carpet at his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nSo swiftly, noiselessly was it done that he had not comprehended—had\r\nnot moved—when she sat upright, resting on her knees, and grasped the\r\ncollar of her tunic with both gemmed hands.\r\n\r\n“Have pity on me, lord of my lost soul!” she cried softly.\r\n\r\nBenton stooped in a dazed way to lift the girl; but found himself knee\r\ndeep in a snowy drift of white hibiscus blossoms—touched nothing but\r\nsilken petals—waded in them as he stepped forward. And saw her standing\r\nbefore him still grasping the collar of her golden tunic.\r\n\r\nA great white drift of bloom lay almost waist deep between them; the\r\nfragrance of oleander, too, was heavy in the room.\r\n\r\n“There are years of life before the flaming gates of Jehaunum open. And\r\nI am very young,” said Yulun wistfully.\r\n\r\nSomebody else laughed in the room. Turning his head, he saw Tressa\r\nstanding by the empty fireplace.\r\n\r\n“What you see and hear need not disturb you,” she said, looking at\r\nBenton out of brilliant eyes. “There is no god but God; and His prophet\r\nhas been called by many names.” And to Yulun: “Have I not told you that\r\nnothing can harm our souls?”\r\n\r\nYulun’s expression altered and she turned to Benton: “Say it to me!”\r\nshe pleaded.\r\n\r\nAs in a dream he heard his own words: “Nothing can ever really harm the\r\nsoul.”\r\n\r\nYulun’s hands fell from her tunic collar. Very slowly she lifted her\r\nhead, looking at him out of lovely, proud young eyes.\r\n\r\nShe said, evenly, her still gaze on him: “I am Yulun of the Temple. My\r\nheart is like a blazing pearl which you hold between your hands. May\r\nthe four Blessed Companions witness the truth of what I say.”\r\n\r\nThen a delicate veil of colour wrapped her white skin from throat to\r\ntemple; she looked at Benton with sudden and exquisite distress,\r\nfrightened and ashamed at his silence.\r\n\r\nIn the intense stillness Benton moved toward her. Into his outstretched\r\nhands her two hands fell; but, bending above them, his lips touched\r\nonly two white hibiscus flowers that lay fresh and dewy in his palms.\r\n\r\nBewildered, he straightened up; and saw the girl standing by the mantel\r\nbeside Tressa, who had caught her by the left hand.\r\n\r\n“Tokhta! Look out!” she said distinctly.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he saw two men in the room, close to him—their broad faces,\r\nslanting eyes, and sparse beards thrust almost against his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Djamouk! Yaddin-ed-Din!” cried Tressa in a terrible voice. But quick\r\nas a flash Yulun tore a white sheet from the bed, flung it on the\r\nfloor, and, whipping a tiny, jewelled knife from her sleeve, threw it\r\nglittering upon the sheet at the feet of the two men.\r\n\r\n“One shroud for two souls!” she said breathlessly, “—and a knife like\r\nthat to sever them from their bodies!”\r\n\r\nThe two men sprang backward as the sheet touched their feet, and now\r\nthey stood there as though confounded.\r\n\r\n“Djamouk, Kahn of the Fifth Tower!” cried Tressa in a clear voice, “you\r\nhave put off your body like a threadbare cloak, and your form that\r\nstands there is only your mind! And it is only the evil will of Yaddin\r\nin the shape of his body that confronts us in this room of a man you\r\nhave doomed!”\r\n\r\nYulun, intent as a young leopardess on her prey, moved soundlessly\r\ntoward Yaddin.\r\n\r\n“Tougtchi!” she said coldly, “you did murder this day, my Banneret, and\r\nthe Toug of Djamouk has been greased. Now look out for yourself!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t stir!” came Tressa’s warning voice, as Benton snatched his\r\npistol from the pillow. “Don’t fire! Those men have no real substance!\r\nFor God’s sake don’t fire! I tell you they have no bodies!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly something—some force—flung Benton on the bed. The two men did\r\nnot seem to touch him at all, but he lay there struggling, crushed,\r\nheld by something that was strangling him.\r\n\r\nThrough his swimming eyes he saw Yaddin trying to drive a long nail\r\ninto his skull with a hammer,—felt the piercing agony of the first\r\ncrashing blow,—struggled upright, drenched in blood, his ears ringing\r\nwith the screaming of Yaddin.\r\n\r\nThen, there in the little rococo bedroom of the Ritz-Carlton, began a\r\nstrange and horrible struggle—the more dreadful because the struggle\r\nwas not physical and the combatants never touched each other—scarcely\r\nmoved at all.\r\n\r\nYaddin, still screaming, confronted Yulun. The girl’s eyes were ablaze,\r\nher lips parted with the violence of her breathing. And Yaddin writhed\r\nand screamed under the terrible concentration of her gaze, his inferior\r\nbut ferocious mind locked with her mind in deadly battle.\r\n\r\nThe girl said slowly, showing a glimmer of white teeth: “Your will to\r\ndo evil to my young lord is breaking, Yaddin-ed-Din.... I am breaking\r\nit. The nail and hammer were but symbols. It was your brain that\r\nbrooded murder—that willed he should die as though shattered by\r\nlightning when that blood-vessel burst in his brain!”\r\n\r\n“Sorceress!” shrieked Yaddin, “what are you doing to my heart, where my\r\nbody lies asleep in a berth on the Montreal Express!”\r\n\r\n“Your heart is weak, Yaddin. Soon the valves shall fail. A negro porter\r\nshall discover you dead in your berth, my Banneret!”\r\n\r\nThe man’s swarthy face became livid with the terrific mental battle.\r\n\r\n“Let me go back to my body!” he panted. “What are you doing to me that\r\nI can not go back? I will go back! I wish it!—I——”\r\n\r\n“Let us go back and rejoin our bodies!” cried Djamouk in an agonised\r\nvoice. “There are teeth in my throat, deep in my throat, biting and\r\ntearing out the cords.”\r\n\r\n“Cancer,” said Tressa calmly. “Your body shall die of it while your\r\nsoul stumbles on through darkness.”\r\n\r\n“My Tougtchi!” shouted Djamouk, “I hear my soul bidding my body\r\nfarewell! I must go before my mind expires in the terrible gaze of this\r\nyoung sorceress!”\r\n\r\nHe turned, drifted like something misty to the solid wall.\r\n\r\n“My soul be ransom for yours!” cried Yulun to Tressa. “Bar that man’s\r\npath to life!”\r\n\r\nTressa flung out her right hand and, with her forefinger, drew a\r\nbarrier through space, bar above bar.\r\n\r\nAnd Benton, half swooning on his bed, saw a cage of terrible and living\r\nlight penning in Djamouk, who beat upon the incandescent bars and\r\ngrasped them and clawed his way about, squealing like a tortured rat in\r\na red-hot cage.\r\n\r\nThrough the deafening tumult Yulun’s voice cut like a sword:\r\n\r\n“Their bodies are dying, Heart of a Rose!... Listen! I hear their souls\r\nbidding their minds farewell!”\r\n\r\nAnd, after a dreadful silence: “The train speeding north carries two\r\ndead men! God is God. Niaz!”\r\n\r\nThe bars of living fire faded. Two cinder-like and shapeless shadows\r\nfloated and eddied like whitened ashes stirred by a wind on the hearth;\r\nthen drifted through the lamp-light, fading, dissolving, lost gradually\r\nin thin air.\r\n\r\nTressa, leaning back against the mantel, covered her face with both\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nYulun crept to the bed where Benton lay, breathing evenly in deepest\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nWith the sheer sleeve of her tunic she wiped the blood from his face.\r\nAnd, at her touch, the wound in the temple closed and the short, bright\r\nhair dried and curled over a forehead as clean and fresh as a boy’s.\r\n\r\nThen Yulun laid her lips against his, rested so a moment.\r\n\r\n“Seek me, dear lord,” she whispered. “Or send me a sign and I shall\r\ncome.”\r\n\r\nAnd, after a pause, she said, her lips scarcely stirring: “Love me. My\r\nheart is a flaming pearl burning between your hands.”\r\n\r\nThen she lifted her head.\r\n\r\nBut Tressa had rejoined her body, where it lay asleep beside her deeply\r\nsleeping husband.\r\n\r\nSo Yulun stood a moment, her eyes remote. Then, after a while, the\r\nlittle rococo bedroom in the Ritz-Carlton was empty save for a young\r\nman asleep on the bed, holding in his clenched hand a white hibiscus\r\nblossom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Excellency President Tintinto, Chief Executive of one of the newer\r\nand cruder republics, visiting New York incognito with his Secretaries\r\nof War and of the Navy, had sent for John Recklow. And now the\r\nreception was in full operation.\r\n\r\nRecklow was explaining. “In the beginning,” he said, “the Bolsheviks’\r\naim was to destroy everything and everybody except themselves, and then\r\nto reorganise for their own benefit what was left of a wrecked world.\r\nThat was their programme——”\r\n\r\n“Quite a programme,” interrupted the Secretary of War, with something\r\nthat almost resembled a giggle. But his prominent eyes continued to\r\nstare at Recklow untouched by the mirth which stretched his large,\r\nsilly mouth.\r\n\r\nThe face of the Secretary of the Navy resembled the countenance of a\r\nbenevolent manatee. The visage of the President was a study in tinted\r\nchalks.\r\n\r\nRecklow said: “To combat that sort of Bolshevism was a business that we\r\nof the United States Secret Service understood—or supposed we\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n“Then, suddenly, out of unknown Mongolia and into the civilised world\r\nstepped eight men.”\r\n\r\n“Yezidees,” said the President mechanically. “Your Government has sent\r\nme a very full report.”\r\n\r\n“Yezidees of the Sect of the Assassins,” continued Recklow; “—the most\r\nancient sect in the world surviving from ancient times—the Sorcerers of\r\nAsia. And, as it was in ancient times, so it is now: the Yezidees are\r\ndevil worshipers; their god is Satan; _his_ prophet is Erlik, Prince of\r\nDarkness; _his_ regent on earth is the old man of Mount Alamout; and to\r\nthis ancient and sinister title a Yezidee sorcerer called Prince\r\nSanang, or Sanang Noïane, has succeeded.\r\n\r\n“His murderous deputies were the Eight Khans of the Eight Towers. Four\r\nof these assassins are dead—Gutchlug, Yarghouz, Djamouk the Fox, and\r\nYaddin-ed-Din. One is in prison charged with murder,—Albert Feke.\r\n\r\n“Four of the sorcerers remain alive: Tiyang Khan, Togrul, Arrak,\r\nSou-Sou, called The Squirrel, and the Old Man of the Mountain himself,\r\nSaï-Sanang, Prince of the Yezidees.”\r\n\r\nRecklow paused; the pop-eyes of the War Secretary were upon him; the\r\nbenevolent manatee gazed mildly at him; the countenance of the\r\nPresident seemed more like a Rocky Mountain goat than ever—chiselled\r\nout of a block of tinted chalk.\r\n\r\nRecklow said: “To the menace of Bolshevism, which endangers this\r\nRepublic and yours, has been added a more terrible threat—the threat of\r\npowerful and evil minds made formidable by psychic knowledge.\r\n\r\n“For these Yezidee Sorcerers are determined to conquer, seize, and\r\nsubdue the minds of mankind. They are here for that frightful purpose.\r\nPowerfully, terrifically equipped to surprise and capture the unarmed\r\nminds of our people, enslave their very thoughts and use them to their\r\nown purposes, these Sorcerers of the Yezidees assumed control of the\r\nBolsheviki, who were merely envious and ferocious bandits, but whose\r\ncrippled minds are now utterly enslaved by these Assassins from Asia.\r\n\r\n“And this is what the United States Secret Service has to combat. And\r\nits weapons are not warrants, not pistols. For in this awful battle\r\nbetween decency and evil, it is mind against mind in an occult death\r\ngrapple. And our only weapon against these minds made powerful by\r\npsychic knowledge and made terrible by an esoteric ability akin to what\r\nis called black magic,—our only weapon is the mind of a young girl.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said the President, “that she became an adept in occult\r\npractices while imprisoned in the Yezidee Temple of Erlik at Yian.”\r\n\r\nRecklow looked into the President’s face, which had grown very pale.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” he said. “God alone knows what this child learned in the\r\nYezidee Temple. All I know is that with this knowledge she has met the\r\nYezidees in a battle of minds, has halted them, confounded them, fought\r\nthem with their own occult knowledge, and has slain four of them.”\r\n\r\nThe intense silence was broken by the frivolous titter of the Secretary\r\nof War:\r\n\r\n“Of course I don’t believe any of this supernatural stuff,” he said\r\nwith the split grin which did not modify his protruding stare. “This\r\ngirl is merely a clever detective, that is the gist of the matter. And\r\nI don’t believe anything else.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, sir, you will believe this, then,” said John Recklow quietly.\r\n“I cut it from the _Times_ this morning.” And he handed the clipping to\r\nthe Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nNEW PLOT IN EAST\r\n\r\nMoslem and Hindu Conspirators\r\nHave Formed Secret\r\nOrganisation\r\n\r\nHave World Revolution in View\r\n\r\nThink to Rouse Asia, America, and Africa\r\nto Outbreaks by Their\r\nPropaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1919, by _The New York Times_ Company.\r\nSpecial Cable to _The New York Times_.\r\n\r\nJuly 1.—A significant event has recently taken place. Under the name of\r\nthe Oriental League has recently been established a central\r\norganisation uniting all the various secret societies of Moslem and\r\nHindu nationalists. The aim of the new association is to prepare for\r\njoint revolutionary action in Asia, America, and Africa.\r\n\r\nThe effects of this vast conspiracy may already be traced in recent\r\nevents in Egypt, India, and Afghanistan. For the first time, through\r\nthe creation of this league, the racial and religious differences which\r\nhave divided Eastern conspirators have been overcome. The Ottoman\r\nLeague, founded by Mahmud Muktar Pasha, Munir Pasha, and Ahmed Rechid\r\nBey, has adhered to the new organisation. So have the extreme Egyptian\r\nnationalists and the Hindu revolutionary group, “Pro India,” emissaries\r\nof which were recently sentenced for bringing bombs into Switzerland\r\nduring the war at the instigation of the German General Staff.\r\n\r\nAt a “Constituent Assembly” of the league, which took place in Yian,\r\nthere were present, besides Young Turks, Egyptians and Hindus,\r\ndelegates representing Persia, Afghanistan, Algeria, Morocco, and\r\nMongolia.\r\n\r\nThe league is of Mongolian origin. Its leading spirit is a certain\r\nPrince Sanang, of whom little is known.\r\n\r\nAssociated with this mischievous and rather mysterious Mongolian\r\npersonage are three better known criminals, now fugitives from\r\njustice—Talaat, Enver, and Djemal. It is to Enver Pasha’s talent for\r\nintrigue that the union between Moslems and Hindus, the most striking\r\nand dangerous feature of the movement, is chiefly due.\r\n\r\nConsiderable funds are at the disposal of the league. These are partly\r\nsupplied from Germany. Besides enjoying the support of the Germans, the\r\nleague is also in close touch with Lenine, who very soon after his\r\nadvent to power organised an Oriental Department in Moscow.\r\n\r\nThe alliance between the league and the Russian Bolsheviki was brought\r\nabout by the notorious German Socialist agent, “Parvus,” who is now in\r\nSwitzerland. Many weeks ago he conferred with the Soviet rulers in\r\nMoscow, whence he went to Afghanistan, hoping to reorganise the new\r\nAmir’s army and establish lines of communication for propaganda in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nEvidence exists that the recent insurrection in Egypt, the sudden\r\nattack of the Afghans, and the rising in India, remarkable for\r\nco-operation between Moslems and Hindus, were connected with the\r\nactivities of the league.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary looked up after he finished the reading.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see anything about Black Magic in this?” he remarked\r\nflippantly.\r\n\r\nRecklow’s features became very grave.\r\n\r\n“I think,” he said, “that everybody—myself included—and, with all\r\nrespect, even yourself, sir,—and your honourable colleague,—and perhaps\r\neven his Excellency your President,—should be on perpetual guard over\r\ntheir minds, and the thoughts that range there, lest, surreptitiously,\r\nstealthily, some taint of Yezidee infection lodge there and take\r\nroot—and spread—perhaps—throughout your new Republic.”\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War grinned. “They say I’m something of a socialist\r\nalready,” he chuckled. “Do you think your magic Yezidees are\r\nresponsible?”\r\n\r\nThe President, troubled and pallid, gazed steadily at Recklow.\r\n\r\n“Mine is a single-track mind,” he remarked as though to himself.\r\n\r\nRecklow said nothing. It is one kind of mind, after all. However,\r\nsingle-track roads are now obsolete.\r\n\r\n“A single-track mind,” repeated the President. “And—I should not like\r\nanything to happen to the switch. It would mean ditching—or a rusty\r\nsiding at best.... Please do all that is possible to get those four\r\nYezidees, Mr. Recklow.”\r\n\r\nRecklow said calmly: “Our only hope is in this young girl, Tressa\r\nNorne, who is now Mrs. Cleves.”\r\n\r\n“My conscience!” piped the Secretary of the Navy. “What would happen to\r\nus if these Yezidees should murder her?”\r\n\r\n“God knows,” replied John Recklow, unsmiling.\r\n\r\n“Why not put her aboard our new dreadnought?” suggested the Secretary,\r\n“and keep her cruising until you United States Secret Service fellows\r\nget the rest of these infernal Yezidees and clap ’em into jail?”\r\n\r\n“We can do nothing without her,” said Recklow sombrely.\r\n\r\nThere was a painful silence. The President joined his finger tips and\r\nstared palely into space.\r\n\r\n“May I not say,” he suggested, “that I think it a vital necessity that\r\nthese Yezidees be caught and destroyed before they do any damage to the\r\nminds of myself and my cabinet?”\r\n\r\n“God grant it, sir,” said Recklow grimly.\r\n\r\n“Mine,” murmured the President, “is a single-track mind. I should be\r\nvery much annoyed if anybody tampered with the rails—very much annoyed\r\nindeed, Mr. Recklow.”\r\n\r\n“They mustn’t murder that girl,” said the Secretary of the Navy. “Do\r\nyou need any Marines, Mr. Recklow? Why not ask your Government for a\r\nfew?”\r\n\r\nRecklow rose: “Mr. President,” he said, “I shall not deny that my\r\nGovernment is very deeply disturbed by this situation. In the\r\nbeginning, these eight Assassins, and Sanang, came here for the purpose\r\nof attacking, overpowering, and enslaving the minds of the people of\r\nthe United States and of the South American Republics.\r\n\r\n“But now, after four of their infamous colleagues have been destroyed,\r\nthe ferocious survivors, thoroughly alarmed, have turned their every\r\nenergy toward accomplishing the death of Mrs. Cleves! Why, sir,\r\nscarcely a day passes but that some attempt upon her life is made by\r\nthese Yezidees.\r\n\r\n“Scarcely a day passes that this young girl is not suddenly summoned to\r\ndefend her mind as well as her body against the occult attacks of these\r\nMongol Sorcerers. Yes, sir, Sorcerers!” repeated Recklow, his calm\r\nvoice deep with controlled passion, “—whatever your honourable\r\nSecretary of War may think about it!”\r\n\r\nHis cold, grey eyes measured the President as he stood there.\r\n\r\n“Mr. President, I am at my wits’ end to protect her from assassination!\r\nHer husband is always with her—Victor Cleves, sir, of our Secret\r\nService. But wherever he takes her these devils follow and send their\r\nemissaries to watch her, to follow, to attempt her mental destruction\r\nor her physical death.\r\n\r\n“There is no end to their stealthy cunning, to their devilish devices,\r\nto their hellish ingenuity!\r\n\r\n“And all we can do is to guard her person from the approach of\r\nstrangers, and stand ready, physically, to aid her.\r\n\r\n“She is our only barrier—_your_ only defence—between civilisation and\r\nhorrors worse than Bolshevism.\r\n\r\n“I believe, Mr. President, that civilisation in North and South\r\nAmerica—in your own Republic as well as in ours—depends, literally,\r\nupon the safety of Tressa Cleves. For, if the Yezidees kill her, then I\r\ndo not see what is to save civilisation from utter disintegration and\r\ntotal destruction.”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Recklow was not certain that the President had\r\nbeen listening.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency sat with finger tips joined, gazing pallidly into space;\r\nand Recklow heard him murmuring under his breath and all to himself, as\r\nthough to fix the deathless thought forever in his brain:\r\n\r\n“May I not say that mine is a single-track mind? May I not say it? May\r\nI not,—may I not,—not, not, not——”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nSA-N’SA\r\n\r\n\r\nJune sunshine poured through the window of his bedroom in the Ritz; and\r\nCleves had just finished dressing when he heard his wife’s voice in the\r\nadjoining sitting-room.\r\n\r\nHe had not supposed that Tressa was awake. He hastened to tie his tie\r\nand pull on a smoking jacket, listening all the while to his wife’s\r\nmodulated but gay young voice.\r\n\r\nThen he opened the sitting-room door and went in. And found his wife\r\nentirely alone.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him, her lips still parted as though checked in what\r\nshe had been saying, the smile still visible in her blue eyes.\r\n\r\n“Who on earth are you talking to?” he asked, his bewildered glance\r\nsweeping the sunny room again.\r\n\r\nShe did not reply; her smile faded as a spot of sunlight wanes, veiled\r\nby a cloud—yet a glimmer of it remained in her gaze as he came over to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“I thought they’d brought our breakfast,” he said, “—hearing your\r\nvoice.... Did you sleep well?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Victor.”\r\n\r\nHe seated himself, and his perplexed scrutiny included her frail\r\nmorning robe of China silk, her lovely bare arms, and her splendid hair\r\ntwisted up and pegged down with a jade dagger. Around her bare throat\r\nand shoulders, too, was a magnificent necklace of imperial jade which\r\nhe had never before seen; and on one slim, white finger a superb jade\r\nring.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” he said, “you’re very exotic this morning, Tressa. I never\r\nbefore saw that negligee effect.”\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed, glanced at her ring, lifted a frail silken fold and\r\nexamined the amazing embroidery.\r\n\r\n“I wore it at the Lake of the Ghosts,” she said.\r\n\r\nThe name of that place always chilled him. He had begun to hate it,\r\nperhaps because of all that he did not know about it—about his wife’s\r\nstrange girlhood—about Yian and the devil’s Temple there—and about\r\nSanang.\r\n\r\nHe said coldly but politely that the robe was unusual and the jade very\r\nwonderful.\r\n\r\nThe alteration in his voice and expression did not escape her. It meant\r\nmerely masculine jealousy, but Tressa never dreamed he cared in that\r\nway.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was brought, served; and presently these two young people\r\nwere busy with their melons, coffee, and toast in the sunny room high\r\nabove the softened racket of traffic echoing through avenue and street\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n“Recklow telephoned me this morning,” he remarked.\r\n\r\nShe looked up, her face serious.\r\n\r\n“Recklow says that Yezidee mischief is taking visible shape. The\r\nSocialist Party is going to be split into bits and a new party,\r\nimpudently and publicly announcing itself as the Communist Party of\r\nAmerica, is being organised. Did you ever hear of anything as\r\nshameless—as outrageous—in this Republic?”\r\n\r\nShe said very quietly: “Sanang has taken prisoner the minds of these\r\nwretched people. He and his remaining Yezidees are giving battle to the\r\nunarmed minds of our American people.”\r\n\r\n“Gutchlug is dead,” said Cleves, “—and Yarghouz and Djamouk, and\r\nYaddin.”\r\n\r\n“But Tiyang Khan is alive, and Togrul, and that cunning demon Arrak\r\nSou-Sou, called The Squirrel,” she said. She bent her head, considering\r\nthe jade ring on her finger. “—And Prince Sanang,” she added in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you let me shoot him when I had the chance?” said Cleves\r\nharshly.\r\n\r\nSo abrupt was his question, so rough his sudden manner, that the girl\r\nlooked up in dismayed surprise. Then a deep colour stained her face.\r\n\r\n“Once,” she said, “Prince Sanang held my heart prisoner—as Erlik held\r\nmy soul.... I told you that.”\r\n\r\n“Is that the reason you gave the fellow a chance?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh.... And possibly you gave Sanang a chance because he still holds\r\nyour—affections!”\r\n\r\nShe said, crimson with the pain of the accusation: “I tore my heart out\r\nof his keeping.... I told you that.... And, believing—trying to believe\r\nwhat you say to me, I have tried to tear my soul out of the claws of\r\nErlik.... Why are you angry?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.... I’m not angry.... The whole horrible situation is\r\nbreaking my nerve, I guess.... With whom were you talking before I came\r\nin?”\r\n\r\nAfter a silence the girl’s smile glimmered.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you won’t like it if I tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“You—such things perplex and worry you.... I am afraid you won’t like\r\nme any the better if I tell you who it was I had been talking with.”\r\n\r\nHis intent gaze never left her. “I want you to tell me,” he repeated.\r\n\r\n“I—I was talking with Sa-n’sa,” she faltered.\r\n\r\n“With whom?”\r\n\r\n“With Sa-n’sa.... We called her Sansa.”\r\n\r\n“Who the dickens is Sansa?”\r\n\r\n“We were three comrades at the Temple,” she said timidly, “—Yulun,\r\nSansa, and myself. We loved each other. We always went to the Lake of\r\nthe Ghosts together—for protection——”\r\n\r\n“Go on!”\r\n\r\n“Sansa was a girl of the Aroulads, born at Buldak—as was Temujin. The\r\nnight she was born three moon-rainbows made circles around her Yaïlak.\r\nThe Baroulass horsemen saw this and prayed loudly in their saddles.\r\nThen they galloped to Yian and came crawling on their bellies to Sanang\r\nNoïane with the news of the miracle. And Sanang came with a thousand\r\nriders in leather armour. And, ‘What is this child’s name?’ he shouted,\r\nriding into the Yaïlak with his black banners flapping around him like\r\ndevil’s wings.\r\n\r\n“A poor Manggoud came out of the tent of skins, carrying the new born\r\ninfant, and touched his head to Sanang’s stirrup. ‘This babe is called\r\nTchagane,’ he said, trembling all over. ‘No!’ cries Sanang, ‘she is\r\ncalled Sansa. Give her to me and may Erlik seize you!’\r\n\r\n“And he took the baby on his saddle in front of him and struck his\r\nspurs deep; and so came Sansa to Yian under a roaring rustle of black\r\nsilk banners.... It is so written in the Book of Iron.... Allahou\r\nEkber.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCleves had leaned his elbow on the table, his forehead rested in his\r\npalm.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was striving in a bewildered way to reconcile such occult\r\nand amazing things with the year 1920—with the commonplace and noisy\r\ncity of New York—with this pretty, modern, sunlit sitting-room in the\r\nRitz-Carlton on Madison Avenue—with this girl in her morning negligee\r\nopposite, her coffee and melon fragrant at her elbow, her wonderful\r\nblue eyes resting on him.\r\n\r\n“Sansa,” he repeated slowly, as though striving to grasp even a single\r\nword from the confusion of names and phrases that were sounding still\r\nin his ears like the vibration of distant and unfamiliar seas.\r\n\r\n“Is this the girl you were talking with just now? In—in _this_ room?”\r\nhe added, striving to understand.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“She wasn’t here, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Her body was not.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!”\r\n\r\nTressa said in her sweet, humorous way: “You must try to accustom\r\nyourself to such things, Victor. You know that Yulun talks to me.... I\r\nwanted to talk to Sansa. The longing awakened me. So—_I made the\r\neffort_.”\r\n\r\n“And she came—I mean the part of her which is not her body.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she came. We talked very happily while I was bathing and\r\ndressing. Then we came in here. She is such a darling!”\r\n\r\n“Where is she?”\r\n\r\n“In Yian, feeding her silk-worms and making a garden. You see, Sansa is\r\nquite wealthy now, because when the Japanese came she filled a bullock\r\ncart with great lumps of spongy gold from the Temple and filled another\r\ncart with Yu-stone, and took the Hezar of Baroulass horsemen on guard\r\nat the Lake of the Ghosts. And with this Keutch, riding a Soubz horse,\r\nand dressed like an Urieng lancer, my pretty little comrade Tchagane,\r\nwho is called Sansa, marched north preceded by two kettle-drums and a\r\ntoug with two tails——”\r\n\r\nTressa’s clear laughter checked her; she clapped her hands, breathless\r\nwith mirth at the picture she evoked.\r\n\r\n“Kai!” she laughed; “what adorable impudence has Sansa! Neither\r\nTchortcha nor Khiounnou dared ask her who were her seven ancestors! No!\r\nAnd when her caravan came to the lovely Yliang river, my darling Sansa\r\nrode out and grasped the lance from her Tougtchi and drove the point\r\ndeep into the fertile soil, crying in a clear voice: ‘A place for\r\nTchagane and her people! Make room for the toug!’\r\n\r\n“Then her Manggoud, who carried the spare steel tip for her lance, got\r\nout of his saddle and, gathering a handful of mulberry leaves, rubbed\r\nthe shaft of the lance till it was all pale green.\r\n\r\n“‘Toug iaglachakho!’ cries my adorable Sansa! ‘Build me here my\r\nUrdu![2]—my Mocalla![3] And upon it pitch my tent of skins!”\r\n\r\nAgain Tressa’s laughter checked her, and she strove to control it with\r\nthe jade ring pressed to her lips.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Victor,” she added in a stifled voice, looking at him out of eyes\r\nfull of mischief, “you don’t realise how funny it was—Sansa and her\r\ntoug and her Urdu—Oh, Allah!—the bones of Tchinguiz must have rattled\r\nin his tomb!”\r\n\r\nHer infectious laughter evoked a responsive but perplexed smile from\r\nCleves; but it was the smile of a bewildered man who has comprehended\r\nvery little of an involved jest; and he looked around at the modern\r\nroom as though to find his bearings.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Tressa leaned forward swiftly and laid one hand on his.\r\n\r\n“You don’t think all this is very funny. You don’t like it,” she said\r\nin soft concern.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t that, Tressa. But this is New York City in the year 1920. And\r\nI can’t—I absolutely can not get into touch—hook up, mentally, with\r\nsuch things—with the unreal Oriental life that is so familiar to you.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded sympathetically: “I know. You feel like a Mergued Pagan from\r\nLake Baïkal when all the lamps are lighted in the Mosque;—like a camel\r\ndriver with his jade and gold when he enters Yarkand at sunrise.”\r\n\r\n“Probably I feel like that,” said Cleves, laughing outright. “I take\r\nyour word, dear, anyway.”\r\n\r\nBut he took more; he picked up her soft hand where it still rested on\r\nhis, pressed it, and instantly reddened because he had done it. And\r\nTressa’s bright flush responded so quickly that neither of them\r\nunderstood, and both misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe girl rose with heightened colour, not knowing why she stood up or\r\nwhat she meant to do. And Cleves, misinterpreting her emotion as a\r\nsilent rebuke to the invasion of that convention tacitly accepted\r\nbetween them, stood up, too, and began to speak carelessly of\r\ncommonplace things.\r\n\r\nShe made the effort to reply, scarcely knowing what she was saying, so\r\nviolently had his caress disturbed her heart,—and she was still\r\nspeaking when their telephone rang.\r\n\r\nCleves went; listened, then, still listening, summoned Tressa to his\r\nside with a gesture.\r\n\r\n“It’s Selden,” he said in a low voice. “He says he has the Yezidee\r\nArrak Sou-Sou under observation, and that he needs you desperately.\r\nWill you help us?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go, of course,” she replied, turning quite pale.\r\n\r\nCleves nodded, still listening. After a while: “All right. We’ll be\r\nthere. Good-bye,” he said sharply; and hung up.\r\n\r\nThen he turned and looked at his wife.\r\n\r\n“I wish to God,” he muttered, “that this business were ended. I—I can’t\r\nbear to have you go.”\r\n\r\n“I am not afraid.... Where is it?”\r\n\r\n“I never heard of the place before. We’re to meet Selden at ‘Fool’s\r\nAcre.’”\r\n\r\n“Where is it, Victor?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Selden says there are no roads,—not even a spotted\r\ntrail. It’s a wilderness left practically blank by the Geological\r\nSurvey. Only the contours are marked, and Selden tells me that the\r\naltitudes are erroneous and the unnamed lakes and water courses are all\r\nwrong. He says it is his absolute conviction that the Geological Survey\r\nnever penetrated this wilderness at all, but merely skirted it and\r\nguessed at what lay inside, because the map he has from Washington is\r\nutterly misleading, and the entire region is left blank except for a\r\nfew vague blue lines and spots indicating water, and a few heights\r\nmarked ‘1800.’”\r\n\r\nHe turned and began to pace the sitting-room, frowning, perplexed,\r\nundecided.\r\n\r\n“Selden tells me,” he said, “that the Yezidee, Arrak Sou-Sou, is in\r\nthere and very busy doing something or other. He says that he can do\r\nnothing without you, and will explain why when we meet him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Victor.”\r\n\r\nCleves turned on his heel and came over to where his wife stood beside\r\nthe sunny window.\r\n\r\n“I hate to ask you to go. I know that was the understanding. But this\r\nincessant danger—your constant peril——”\r\n\r\n“That does not count when I think of my country’s peril,” she said in a\r\nquiet voice. “When are we to start? And what shall I pack in my trunk?”\r\n\r\n“Dear child,” he said with a brusque laugh, “it’s a wilderness and we\r\ncarry what we need on our backs. Selden meets us at a place called\r\nGlenwild, on the edge of this wilderness, and we follow him in on our\r\ntwo legs.”\r\n\r\nHe glanced across at the mantel clock.\r\n\r\n“If you’ll dress,” he said nervously, “we’ll go to some shop that\r\noutfits sportsmen for the North. Because, if we can, we ought to leave\r\non the one o’clock train.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled; came up to him. “Don’t worry about me,” she said. “Because\r\nI also am nervous and tired; and I mean to make an end of every Yezidee\r\nremaining in America.”\r\n\r\n“Sanang, too?”\r\n\r\nThey both flushed deeply.\r\n\r\nShe said in a steady voice: “Between God and Erlik there is a black\r\ngulf where a million million stars hang, lighting a million million\r\nother worlds.\r\n\r\n“Prince Sanang’s star glimmers there. It is a sun, called Yramid. And\r\nit lights the planet, Yu-tsung. Let him reign there between God and\r\nErlik.”\r\n\r\n“You will slay this man?”\r\n\r\n“God forbid!” she said, shuddering. “But I shall send him to his own\r\nstar. Let my soul be ransom for his! And may Allah judge between\r\nus—between this man and me.”\r\n\r\nThen, in the still, sunny room, the girl turned to face the East. And\r\nher husband saw her lips move as though speaking, but heard no sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n“What on earth are you saying there, all to yourself?” he demanded at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head and looked at him across her left shoulder.\r\n\r\n“I asked Sansa to help me.... And she says she will.”\r\n\r\nCleves nodded in a dazed way. Then he opened a window and leaned there\r\nin the sunshine, looking down into Madison Avenue. And the roar of\r\ntraffic seemed to soothe his nerves.\r\n\r\nBut “Good heavens!” he thought; “do such things really go on in New\r\nYork in 1920! Is the entire world becoming a little crazy? Am I really\r\nin my right mind when I believe that the girl I married is talking,\r\nwithout wireless, to another girl in China!”\r\n\r\nHe leaned there heavily, gazing down into the street with sombre eyes.\r\n\r\n“What a ghastly thing these Yezidees are trying to do to the\r\nworld—these Assassins of men’s minds’!” he thought, turning away toward\r\nthe door of his bedroom.\r\n\r\nAs he crossed the threshold he stumbled, and looking down saw that he\r\nhad tripped over a white sheet lying there. For a moment he thought it\r\nwas a sheet from his own bed, and he started to pick it up. Then he saw\r\nthe naked blade of a knife at his feet.\r\n\r\nWith an uncontrollable shudder he stepped out of the shroud and stood\r\nstaring at the knife as though it were a snake. It had a curved blade\r\nand a bone hilt coarsely inlaid with Arabic characters in brass.\r\n\r\nThe shroud was a threadbare affair—perhaps a bed-sheet from some cheap\r\nlodging house. But its significance was so repulsive that he hesitated\r\nto touch it.\r\n\r\nHowever, he was ashamed to have it discovered in his room. He picked up\r\nthe brutal-looking knife and kicked the shroud out into the corridor,\r\nwhere they could guess if they liked how such a rag got into the\r\nRitz-Carlton.\r\n\r\nThen he searched his bedroom, and, of course, discovered nobody hiding.\r\nBut chills crawled on his spine while he was about it, and he shivered\r\nstill as he stood in the centre of the room examining the knife and\r\ntesting edge and point.\r\n\r\nThen, close to his ear, a low voice whispered: “Be careful, my lord;\r\nthe Yezidee knife is poisoned. But it is written that a poisoned heart\r\nis more dangerous still.”\r\n\r\nHe had turned like a flash; and he saw, between him and the\r\nsitting-room door, a very young girl with slightly slanting eyes, and\r\nrose and ivory features as perfect as though moulded out of tinted\r\nbisque.\r\n\r\nShe wore a loose blue linen robe, belted in, short at the elbows and\r\nskirt, showing two creamy-skinned arms and two bare feet in straw\r\nsandals. In one hand she had a spray of purple mulberries, and she\r\nlooked coolly at Cleves and ate a berry or two.\r\n\r\n“Give me the knife,” she said calmly.\r\n\r\nHe handed it to her; she wiped it with a mulberry leaf and slipped it\r\nthrough her girdle.\r\n\r\n“I am Sansa,” she said with a friendly glance at him, busy with her\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nCleves strove to speak naturally, but his voice trembled.\r\n\r\n“Is it you—I mean your real self—your own body?”\r\n\r\n“It’s my real self. Yes. But my body is asleep in my mulberry grove.”\r\n\r\n“In—in China?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said calmly, detaching another mulberry and eating it. A few\r\nfresh leaves fell on the centre table.\r\n\r\nSansa chose another berry. “You know,” she said, “that I came to Tressa\r\nthis morning,—to my little Heart of Fire I came when she called me. And\r\nI was quite sleepy, too. But I heard her, though there was a night wind\r\nin the mulberry trees, and the river made a silvery roaring noise in\r\nthe dark.... And now I must go. But I shall come again very soon.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled shyly and held out her lovely little hand, “—As Tressa tells\r\nme is your custom in America,” she said, “I offer you a good-bye.”\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and found it a warm, smooth thing of life and pulse.\r\n\r\n“Why,” he stammered in his astonishment, “you _are_ real! You are not a\r\nghost!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am real,” she answered, surprised, “but I’m not in my body,—if\r\nyou mean that.” Then she laughed and withdrew her hand, and, going,\r\nmade him a friendly gesture.\r\n\r\n“Cherish, my lord, my darling Heart of Fire. Serpents twist and twine.\r\nSo do rose vines. May their petals make your path of velvet and sweet\r\nscented. May everything that is round be a pomegranate for you two to\r\nshare; may everything that sways be lilies bordering a path wide enough\r\nfor two. In the name of the Most Merciful God, may the only cry you\r\nhear be the first sweet wail of your first-born. And when the tenth\r\nshall be born, may you and Heart of Fire bewail your fate because both\r\nof you desire more children!”\r\n\r\nShe was laughing when she disappeared. Cleves thought she was still\r\nthere, so radiant the sunshine, so sweet the scent in the room.\r\n\r\nBut the golden shadow by the door was empty of her. If she had slipped\r\nthrough the doorway he had not noticed her departure. Yet she was no\r\nlonger there. And, when he understood, he turned back into the empty\r\nroom, quivering all over. Suddenly a terrible need of Tressa assailed\r\nhim—an imperative necessity to speak to her—hear her voice.\r\n\r\n“Tressa!” he called, and rested his hand on the centre table, feeling\r\nweak and shaken to the knees. Then he looked down and saw the mulberry\r\nleaves lying scattered there, tender and green and still dewy with the\r\ndew of China.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my God!” he whispered, “such things _are_! It isn’t my mind that\r\nhas gone wrong. There _are_ such things!”\r\n\r\nThe conviction swept him like a tide till his senses swam. As though\r\npeering through a mist of gold he saw his wife enter and come to\r\nhim;—felt her arm about him, sustaining him where he swayed slightly\r\nwith one hand on the table among the mulberry leaves.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” murmured Tressa, noticing the green leaves, “she oughtn’t to have\r\ndone that. That was thoughtless of her, to show herself to you.”\r\n\r\nCleves looked at her in a dazed way. “The body is nothing,” he\r\nmuttered. “The rest only is real. That is the truth, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I seem to be beginning to believe it.... Sansa said things—I shall try\r\nto tell you—some day—dear.... I’m so glad to hear your voice.”\r\n\r\n“Are you?” she murmured.\r\n\r\n“And so glad to feel your touch.... I found a shroud on my threshold.\r\nAnd a knife.”\r\n\r\n“The Yezidees are becoming mountebanks.... Where is the knife?” she\r\nasked scornfully.\r\n\r\n“Sansa said it was poisoned. She took it. She—she said that a poisoned\r\nheart is more dangerous still.”\r\n\r\nThen Tressa threw up her head and called softly into space: “Sansa!\r\nLittle Silk-Moth! What are these mischievous things you have told to my\r\nlord?”\r\n\r\nShe stood silent, listening. And, in the answer which he could not\r\nhear, there seemed to be something that set his young wife’s cheeks\r\naflame.\r\n\r\n“Sansa! Little devil!” she cried, exasperated. “May Erlik send his imps\r\nto pinch you if you have said to my lord these shameful things. It was\r\nimpudent! It was mischievous! You cover me with shame and confusion,\r\nand I am humbled in the dust of my lord’s feet!”\r\n\r\nCleves looked at her, but she could not sustain his gaze.\r\n\r\n“Did Sansa say to you what she said to me?” he demanded unsteadily.\r\n\r\n“Yes.... I ask your pardon.... And I had already _told_ her you did\r\nnot—did not—were not—in—love—with me.... I ask your pardon.”\r\n\r\n“Ask more.... Ask your heart whether it would care to hear that I am in\r\nlove. And with whom. Ask your heart if it could ever care to listen to\r\nwhat my heart could say to it.”\r\n\r\n“Y-yes—I’ll ask—my heart,” she faltered.... “I think I had better\r\nfinish dressing——” She lifted her eyes, gave him a breathless smile as\r\nhe caught her hand and kissed it.\r\n\r\n“It—it would be very wonderful,” she stammered, “—if our necessity\r\nshould be-become our choice.”\r\n\r\nBut that speech seemed to scare her and she fled, leaving her husband\r\nstanding tense and upright in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir train on the New York Central Railroad left the Grand Central\r\nTerminal at one in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nCleves had made his arrangements by wire. They travelled lightly,\r\ncarrying, except for the clothing they wore, only camping equipment for\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nIt was raining in the Hudson valley; they rushed through the outlying\r\ntowns and Po’keepsie in a summer downpour.\r\n\r\nAt Hudson the rain slackened. A golden mist enveloped Albany, through\r\nwhich the beautiful tower and façades along the river loomed, masking\r\nthe huge and clumsy Capitol and the spires beyond.\r\n\r\nAt Schenectady, rifts overhead revealed glimpses of blue. At Amsterdam,\r\nwhere they descended from the train, the flag on the arsenal across the\r\nMohawk flickered brilliantly in the sunny wind.\r\n\r\nBy telegraphic arrangement, behind the station waited a touring car\r\ndriven by a trooper of State Constabulary, who, with his comrade,\r\nsaluted smartly as Cleves and Tressa came up.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief, low-voiced conversation. Their camping outfit was\r\nstowed aboard, Tressa sprang into the tonneau followed by Cleves, and\r\nthe car started swiftly up the inclined roadway, turned to the right\r\nacross the railroad bridge, across the trolley tracks, and straight on\r\nup the steep hill paved with blocks of granite.\r\n\r\nOn the level road which traversed the ridge at last they speeded up,\r\nwhizzed past the great hedged farm where racing horses are bred,\r\nrushing through the afternoon sunshine through the old-time Scotch\r\nsettlements which once were outposts of the old New York frontier.\r\n\r\nNine miles out the macadam road ended. They veered to the left over a\r\ndirt road, through two hamlets; then turned to the right.\r\n\r\nThe landscape became rougher. To their left lay the long, low Maxon\r\nhills; behind them the Mayfield range stretched northward into the open\r\njaws of the Adirondacks.\r\n\r\nAll around them were woods, now. Once a Gate House appeared ahead; and\r\nbeyond it they crossed four bridges over a foaming, tumbling creek\r\nwhere Cleves caught glimpses of shadowy forms in amber-tinted pools—big\r\nyellow trout that sank unhurriedly out of sight among huge submerged\r\nboulders wet with spray.\r\n\r\nThe State trooper beside the chauffeur turned to Cleves, his purple tie\r\nwhipping in the wind.\r\n\r\n“Yonder is Glenwild, sir,” he said.\r\n\r\nIt was a single house on the flank of a heavily forested hill. Deep\r\nbelow to the left the creek leaped two cataracts and went flashing out\r\nthrough a belt of cleared territory ablaze with late sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe car swung into the farm-yard, past the barn on the right, and\r\ncontinued on up a very rough trail.\r\n\r\n“This is the road to the Ireland Vlaie,” said the trooper. “It is\r\npossible for cars for another mile only.”\r\n\r\nSplendid spruce, pine, oak, maple, and hemlock fringed the swampy,\r\nuneven trail which was no more than a wide, rough vista cut through the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nAnd, as the trooper had said, a little more than a mile farther the\r\ntrail became a tangle of bushes and swale; the car slowed down and\r\nstopped; and a man rose from where he was seated on a mossy log and\r\ncame forward, his rifle balanced across the hollow of his left arm.\r\n\r\nThe man was Alek Selden.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was long after dark and they were still travelling through pathless\r\nwoods by the aid of their electric torches.\r\n\r\nThere was little underbrush; the forest of spruce and hemlock was first\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nCleves shined the trees but could discover no blazing, no trodden path.\r\n\r\nIn explanation, Selden said briefly that he had hunted the territory\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t begin to know it,” he added. “There are vast and ugly\r\nregions of bog and swale where a sea of alders stretches to the\r\nhorizon. There are desolate wastes of cat-briers and witch-hopple under\r\nleprous tangles of grey birches, where stealthy little brooks darkle\r\ndeep under matted débris. Only wild things can travel such country.\r\n\r\n“Then there are strange, slow-flowing creeks in the perpetual shadows\r\nof tamarack woods, where many a man has gone in never to come out.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Tressa.\r\n\r\n“Under the tender carpet of green cresses are shining black bogs set\r\nwith tussock; and under the bog stretches quicksand,—and death.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know these places?” asked Cleves.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nCleves stepped forward to Tressa’s side.\r\n\r\n“Keep flashing the ground,” he said harshly. “I don’t want you to step\r\ninto some hell-hole. I’m sorry I brought you, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“But I had to come,” she said in a low voice.\r\n\r\nLike the two men, she wore a grey flannel shirt, knickers, and spiral\r\nputtees.\r\n\r\nThey, however, carried rifles as well as packs; and the girl’s pack was\r\nlighter.\r\n\r\nThey had halted by a swift, icy rivulet to eat, without building a\r\nfire. After that they crossed the Ireland Vlaie and the main creek,\r\nwhere remains of a shanty stood on the bluff above the right bank—the\r\nlast sign of man.\r\n\r\nBeyond lay the uncharted land, skimped and shirked entirely in certain\r\nregions by map-makers;—an unknown wilderness on the edges of which\r\nSelden had often camped when deer shooting.\r\n\r\nIt was along this edge he was leading them, now, to a lean-to which he\r\nhad erected, and from which he had travelled in to Glenwild to use the\r\nsuperintendent’s telephone to New York.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no animal life stirring in this forest; their\r\ntorches illuminated no fiery orbs of dazed wild things surprised at\r\ngaze in the wilderness; no leaping furry form crossed their\r\nflashlights’ fan-shaped radiance.\r\n\r\nThere were no nocturnal birds to be seen or heard, either: no bittern\r\nsquawked from hidden sloughs; no herons howled; not an owl-note, not a\r\nwhispering cry of a whippoorwill, not the sudden uncanny twitter of\r\nthose little birds that become abruptly vocal after dark, interrupted\r\nthe dense stillness of the forest.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not until his electric torch glimmered repeatedly upon\r\nreaches of dusk-hidden bog that Cleves understood how Selden took his\r\nbearings—for the night was thick and there were no stars.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Selden tersely, “I’m trying to skirt the bog until I shine\r\na peeled stick.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour later the peeled alder-stem glittered in the beam of the\r\ntorches. In ten minutes something white caught the electric rays.\r\n\r\nIt was Selden’s spare undershirt drying on a bush behind the lean-to.\r\n\r\n“Can we have a fire?” asked Cleves, relieving his wife of her pack and\r\nstriding into the open-faced camp.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ll fix it,” replied Selden. “Are you all right, Mrs. Cleves?”\r\n\r\nTressa said: “Delightfully tired, thank you.” And smiled faintly at her\r\nhusband as he let go his own pack, knelt, and spread a blanket for his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nHe remained there, kneeling, as she seated herself.\r\n\r\n“Are you quite fit?” he asked bluntly. Yet, through his brusqueness her\r\near caught a vague undertone of something else—anxiety perhaps—perhaps\r\ntenderness. And her heart stirred deliciously in her breast.\r\n\r\nHe inflated a pillow for her; the firelight glimmered, brightened,\r\nspread glowing across her feet. She lay back with a slight sigh,\r\nrelaxed.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, the thrill of her husband’s touch flooded her face with\r\ncolour; but she lay motionless, one arm flung across her eyes, while he\r\nunrolled her puttees and unlaced her muddy shoes.\r\n\r\nA heavenly warmth from the fire dried her stockinged feet. Later, on\r\nthe edge of sleep, she opened her eyes and found herself propped\r\nupright on her husband’s shoulder.\r\n\r\nDrowsily, obediently she swallowed spoonfuls of the hot broth which he\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\n“Are you really quite comfortable, dear?” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“Wonderfully.... And so very happy.... Thank you—dear.”\r\n\r\nShe lay back, suffering him to bathe her face and hands with warm\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWhen the fire was only a heap of dying coals, she turned over on her\r\nright side and extended her hand a little way into the darkness.\r\nSearching, half asleep, she touched her husband, and her hand relaxed\r\nin his nervous clasp. And she fell into the most perfect sleep which\r\nshe had known in years.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe dreamed that somebody whispered to her, “Darling, darling, wake up.\r\nIt is morning, beloved.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly she opened her eyes; and saw her husband set a tray, freshly\r\nplaited out of Indian willow, beside her blanket.\r\n\r\n“Here’s your breakfast, pretty lady,” he said, smilingly. “And over\r\nthere is an exceedingly frigid pool of water. You’re to have the camp\r\nto yourself for the next hour or two.”\r\n\r\n“You dear fellow,” she murmured, still confused by sleep, and reached\r\nout to touch his hand. He caught hers and kissed it, back and palm, and\r\ngot up hastily as though scared.\r\n\r\n“Selden and I will stand sentry,” he muttered. “There is no hurry, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nShe heard him and his comrade walking away over dried leaves; their\r\nsteps receded; a dry stick cracked distantly; then silence stealthily\r\ninvaded the place like a cautious living thing, creeping unseen through\r\nthe golden twilight of the woods.\r\n\r\nSeated in her blanket, she drank the coffee; ate a little; then lay\r\ndown again in the early sun, feeling the warmth of the heap of\r\nwhitening coals at her feet, also.\r\n\r\nFor an hour she dozed awake, drowsily opening her eyes now and then to\r\nlook across the glade at the pool over which a single dragon-fly\r\nglittered on guard.\r\n\r\nFinally she rose resolutely, grasped a bit of soap, and went down to\r\nthe edge of the pool.\r\n\r\n\r\nTressa was in flannel shirt and knickers when her husband and Selden\r\nhailed the camp and presently appeared walking slowly toward the dead\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nTheir grave faces checked her smile of greeting; her husband came up\r\nand laid one hand on her arm, looking at her out of thoughtful,\r\npreoccupied eyes.\r\n\r\n“What is the Tchordagh?” he said in a low voice.\r\n\r\nThe girl’s quiet face went white.\r\n\r\n“The—the Tchordagh!” she stammered.\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear. What is it?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t—don’t know where you heard that term,” she whispered. “The\r\nTchordagh is the—the power of Erlik. It is a term.... In it is\r\ncomprehended all the evil, all the cunning, all the perverted spiritual\r\nintelligence of Evil,—its sinister might,—its menace. It is an\r\nAlouäd-Yezidee term, and it is written in brass in Eighur characters on\r\nthe Eight Towers, and on the Rampart of Gog and Magog;—nowhere else in\r\nthe world!”\r\n\r\n“It is written on a pine tree a few paces from this camp,” said Cleves\r\nabsently.\r\n\r\nSelden said: “It has not been there more than an hour or two, Mrs.\r\nCleves. A square of bark was cut out and on the white surface of the\r\nwood this word is written in English.”\r\n\r\n“Can you tell us what it signifies?” asked Cleves, quietly.\r\n\r\nTressa’s studied effort at self-control was apparent to both men.\r\n\r\nShe said: “When that word is written, then it is a death struggle\r\nbetween all the powers of Darkness and those who have read the written\r\nletters of that word.... For it is written in The Iron Book that no one\r\nbut the Assassin of Khorassan—excepting the Eight Sheiks—shall read\r\nthat written word and live to boast of having read it.”\r\n\r\n“Let us sit here and talk it over,” said Selden soberly.\r\n\r\nAnd when Tressa was seated on a fallen log, and Cleves settled down\r\ncross-legged at her feet, Selden spoke again, very soberly:\r\n\r\n“On the edges of these woods, to the northwest, lies a sea of briers,\r\nclose growing, interwoven and matted, strong and murderous as barbed\r\nwire.\r\n\r\n“Miles out in this almost impenetrable region lies a patch of trees\r\ncalled Fool’s Acre.\r\n\r\n“At Wells I heard that the only man who had ever managed to reach\r\nFool’s Acre was a trapper, and that he was still living.\r\n\r\n“I found him at Rainbow Lake—a very old man, who had a fairly clear\r\nrecollection of Fool’s Acre and his exhausting journey there.\r\n\r\n“And he told me that man had been there before he had. For there was a\r\nroofless stone house there, and the remains of a walled garden. And a\r\nskull deep in the wild grasses.”\r\n\r\nSelden paused and looked down at the recently healed scars on his\r\nwrists and hands.\r\n\r\n“It was a rotten trip,” he said bluntly. “It took me three days to cut\r\na tunnel through that accursed tangle of matted brier and grey\r\nbirch.... Fool’s Acre is a grove of giant trees—first growth pine, oak,\r\nand maple. Great outcrops of limestone ledges bound it on the east. A\r\nbrook runs through the woods.\r\n\r\n“There is a house there, _no longer roofless_, and built of slabs of\r\nfossil-pitted limestone. The glass in the windows is so old that it is\r\niridescent.\r\n\r\n“A seven-foot wall encloses the house, built also of slabs blasted out\r\nof the rock outcrop, and all pitted with fossil shells.\r\n\r\n“Inside is a garden—not the _remains_ of one—a beautiful garden full of\r\nunfamiliar flowers. And in this garden I saw the Yezidee on his knees\r\n_making living things out of lumps of dead earth_!”\r\n\r\n“The Tchordagh!” whispered the girl.\r\n\r\n“What was the Yezidee doing?” demanded Cleves nervously.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily all three drew nearer each other there in the sunshine.\r\n\r\n“It was difficult for me to see,” said Selden in his quiet, serious\r\nvoice. “It was nearly twilight: I lay flat on top of the wall under the\r\ncurving branches of a huge syringa bush in full bloom. The Yezidees——”\r\n\r\n“Were there two!” exclaimed Cleves.\r\n\r\n“Two. They were squatting on the old stone path bordering one of the\r\nflower-beds.” He turned to Tressa: “They both wore white cloths twisted\r\naround their heads, and long soft garments of white. Under these their\r\nbare, brown legs showed, but they wore things on their naked feet which\r\nwere shaped like what we call Turkish slippers—only different.”\r\n\r\n“Black and green,” nodded Tressa with the vague horror growing in her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Yes. The soles of their shoes were bright green.”\r\n\r\n“Green is the colour sacred to Islam,” said Tressa. “The priests of\r\nSatan defile it by staining with green the soles of their footwear.”\r\n\r\nAfter an interval: “Go on,” said Cleves nervously.\r\n\r\nSelden drew closer, and they bent their heads to listen:\r\n\r\n“I don’t, even now, know what the Yezidees were actually doing. In the\r\ntwilight it was hard to see clearly. But I’ll tell you what it looked\r\nlike to me. One of these squatting creatures would scoop out a handful\r\nof soil from the flower-bed, and mould it for a few moments between his\r\nlean, sinewy fingers, and then he’d open his hands and—and something\r\n_alive_—something small like a rat or a toad, or God knows what, would\r\nescape from between his palms and run out into the grass——”\r\n\r\nSelden’s voice failed and he looked at Cleves with sickened eyes.\r\n\r\n“I can’t—can’t make you understand how repulsive to me it was to see a\r\nwriggling live thing creep out between their fingers and—and go running\r\nor scrambling away—little loathsome things with humpy backs that hopped\r\nor scurried through the grass——”\r\n\r\n“What on earth _were_ these Yezidees doing, Tressa?” asked Cleves\r\nalmost roughly.\r\n\r\nThe girl’s white face was marred by the imprints of deepening horror.\r\n\r\n“It is the Tchor-Dagh,” she said mechanically. “They are using every\r\nresource of hell to destroy me—testing the gigantic power of Evil—as\r\nthough it were some vast engine charged with thunderous\r\ndestruction!—and they were testing it to discover its terrific capacity\r\nto annihilate——”\r\n\r\nHer voice died in her dry throat; she dropped her bloodless visage into\r\nboth hands and remained seated so.\r\n\r\nBoth men looked at her in silence, not daring to interfere. Finally the\r\ngirl lifted her pallid face from her hands.\r\n\r\n“That is what they were doing,” she said in a dull voice. “Out of\r\ninanimate earth they were making things animate—living creatures—to—to\r\ntest the hellish power which they are storing—concentrating—for my\r\ndestruction.”\r\n\r\n“What is their purpose?” asked Cleves harshly. “What do these Mongol\r\nSorcerers expect to gain by making little live things out of lumps of\r\ngarden dirt?”\r\n\r\n“They are testing their power,” whispered the girl.\r\n\r\n“Like tuning up a huge machine?” muttered Selden.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“For what purpose?”\r\n\r\n“To make larger living creatures out of—of clay.”\r\n\r\n“They can’t—they can’t _create_!” exclaimed Cleves. “I don’t know\r\nhow—by what filthy tricks—they make rats out of dirt. But they can’t\r\nmake a—anything—like a—like a man!”\r\n\r\nTressa’s body trembled slightly.\r\n\r\n“Once,” she said, “in the temple, Prince Sanang took dust which was\r\nbrought in sacks of goat-skin, and fashioned the heap of dirt with his\r\nhands, so that it resembled the body of a man lying there on the marble\r\nfloor under the shrine of Erlik.... And—and then, there in the shadows\r\nwhere only the Dark Star burned—that black lamp which is called the\r\nDark Star—the long heap of dust lying there on the marble pavement\r\nbegan to—to _breathe_!—”\r\n\r\nShe pressed both hands over her breast as though to control her\r\ntrembling body: “I saw it; I saw the long shape of dust begin to\r\nbreathe, to stir, move, and slowly lift itself——”\r\n\r\n“A Yezidee trick!” gasped Cleves; but he also was trembling now.\r\n\r\n“God!” whispered the girl. “Allah alone knows—the Merciful, the Long\r\nSuffering—He knows what it was that we temple girls saw there—that\r\nYulun saw—that Sa-n’sa and I beheld there rising up like a man from the\r\nmarble floor—and standing erect in the shadowy twilight of the Dark\r\nStar....”\r\n\r\nHer hands gripped at her breast; her face was deathly.\r\n\r\n“Then,” she said, “I saw Prince Sanang draw his sabre of Indian steel,\r\nand he struck ... once only.... And a dead man fell down where the\r\n_thing_ had stood. And all the marble was flooded with scarlet blood.”\r\n\r\n“A trick,” repeated Cleves, in the ghost of his own voice. But his gaze\r\ngrew vacant.\r\n\r\nPresently Selden spoke in tones that sounded weakly querulous from\r\nemotional reaction:\r\n\r\n“There is a path—a tunnel under the matted briers. It took me more than\r\na week to cut it out. It is possible to reach Fool’s Acre. We can\r\ntry—with our rifles—if you say so, Mrs. Cleves.”\r\n\r\nThe girl looked up. A little colour came into her cheeks. She shook her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Their bodies may not be there in the garden,” she said absently. “What\r\nyou saw may not have been that part of them—the material which dies by\r\nknife or bullet.... And it is necessary that these Yezidees should\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\n“Can you do anything?” asked Cleves, hoarsely.\r\n\r\nShe looked at her husband; tried to smile:\r\n\r\n“I must try.... I think we had better not lose any time—if Mr. Selden\r\nwill lead us.”\r\n\r\n“Now?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we had better go, I think,” said the girl. Her smile still\r\nremained stamped on her lips, but her eyes seemed preoccupied as though\r\nfollowing the movements of something remote that was passing across the\r\nfar horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nA DEATH TRAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way to Fool’s Acre was under a tangled canopy of thorns, under\r\nrotting windfalls of grey mirch, through tunnel after tunnel of fallen\r\ndébris woven solidly by millions of strands of tough cat-briers which\r\ncut the flesh like barbed wire.\r\n\r\nThere was blood on Tressa, where her flannel shirt had been pierced in\r\na score of places. Cleves and Selden had been painfully slashed.\r\n\r\nSilent, thread-like streams flowed darkling under the tangled mass that\r\nroofed them. Sometimes they could move upright; more often they were\r\nbent double; and there were long stretches where they had to creep\r\nforward on hands and knees through sparse wild grasses, soft, rotten\r\nsoil, or paths of sphagnum which cooled their feverish skin in velvety,\r\nicy depths.\r\n\r\nAt noon they rested and ate, lying prone under the matted roof of their\r\ntunnel.\r\n\r\nCleves and Selden had their rifles. Tressa lay like a slender boy, her\r\nbrier-torn hands empty.\r\n\r\nAnd, as she lay there, her husband made a sponge of a handful of\r\nsphagnum moss, and bathed her face and her arms, cleansing the dried\r\nblood from the skin, while the girl looked up at him out of grave,\r\ninscrutable eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun hung low over the wilderness when they came to the woods of\r\nFool’s Acre. They crept cautiously out of the briers, among ferns and\r\nopen spots carpeted with pine needles and dead leaves which were\r\nbeginning to burn ruddy gold under the level rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nLying flat behind an enormous oak, they remained listening for a while.\r\nSelden pointed through the woods, eastward, whispering that the house\r\nstood there not far away.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think we might risk the chance and use our rifles?” asked\r\nCleves in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“No. It is the Tchor-Dagh that confronts us. I wish to talk to Sansa,”\r\nshe murmured.\r\n\r\nA moment later Selden touched her arm.\r\n\r\n“My God,” he breathed, “who is that!”\r\n\r\n“It is Sansa,” said Tressa calmly, and sat up among the ferns. And the\r\nnext instant Sansa stepped daintily out of the red sunlight and seated\r\nherself among them without a sound.\r\n\r\nNobody spoke. The newcomer glanced at Selden, smiled slightly, blushed,\r\nthen caught a glimpse of Cleves where he lay in the brake, and a\r\nmischievous glimmer came into her slanting eyes.\r\n\r\n“Did I not tell my lord truths?” she inquired in a demure whisper. “As\r\nsurely as the sun is a dragon, and the flaming pearl burns between his\r\nclaws, so surely burns the soul of Heart of Flame between thy guarding\r\nhands. There are as many words as there are demons, my lord, but it is\r\nwritten that _Niaz_ is the greatest of all words save only the name of\r\nGod.”\r\n\r\nShe laughed without any sound, sweetly malicious where she sat among\r\nthe ferns.\r\n\r\n“Heart of Flame,” she said to Tressa, “you called me and I _made the\r\neffort_.”\r\n\r\n“Darling,” said Tressa in her thrilling voice, “the Yezidees are making\r\nliving things out of dust,—as Sanang Noïane made that thing in the\r\nTemple.... And slew it before our eyes.”\r\n\r\n“The Tchor-Dagh,” said Sansa calmly.\r\n\r\n“The Tchor-Dagh,” whispered Tressa.\r\n\r\nSansa’s smooth little hands crept up to the collar of her odd, blue\r\ntunic; grasped it.\r\n\r\n“In the name of God the Merciful,” she said without a tremor, “listen\r\nto me, Heart of Flame, and may my soul be ransom for yours!”\r\n\r\n“I hear you, Sansa.”\r\n\r\nSansa said, her fingers still grasping the embroidered collar of her\r\ntunic:\r\n\r\n“Yonder, behind walls, two Tower Chiefs meddle with the Tchor-Dagh,\r\nmaking living things out of the senseless dust they scrape from the\r\ngarden.”\r\n\r\nSelden moistened his dry lips. Sansa said:\r\n\r\n“The Yezidees who have come into this wilderness are Arrak Sou-Sou, the\r\nSquirrel; and Tiyang Khan.... May God remember them in Hell!”\r\n\r\n“May God remember them,” said Tressa mechanically.\r\n\r\n“And these two Yezidee Sorcerers,” continued Sansa coolly, “have\r\nadvanced thus far in the Tchor-Dagh; for they now roam these woods,\r\ndigging like demons, for the roots of Ginseng; and thou knowest, O\r\nHeart of Flame, what that indicates.”\r\n\r\n“Does Ginseng grow in these woods!” exclaimed Tressa with a new terror\r\nin her widening eyes.\r\n\r\n“Ginseng grows here, little Rose-Heart, and the roots are as perfect as\r\nhuman bodies. And Tiyang Khan squats in the walled garden moulding the\r\nGinseng roots in his unclean hands, while Sou-Sou the Squirrel\r\nscratches among the dead leaves of the woods for roots as perfect as a\r\nnaked human body.\r\n\r\n“All day long the Sou-Sou rummages among the trees; all day long Tiyang\r\npats and rubs and moulds the Ginseng roots in his skinny fingers. It is\r\nthe Tchor-Dagh, Heart of Flame. And these Sorcerers must be destroyed.”\r\n\r\n“Are their bodies here?”\r\n\r\n“Arrak is in the body. And thus it shall be accomplished: listen\r\nattentively, Rose Heart Afire!—I shall remain here with——” she looked\r\nat Selden and flushed a trifle, “—with you, my lord. And when the\r\nSquirrel comes a-digging, so shall my lord slay him with a bullet....\r\nAnd when I hear his soul bidding his body farewell, then I shall make\r\nprisoner his soul.... And send it to the Dark Star.... And the rest\r\nshall be in the hands of Allah.”\r\n\r\nShe turned to Tressa and caught her hands in both of her own:\r\n\r\n“It is written on the Iron Pages,” she whispered, “that we belong to\r\nErlik and we return to him. But in the Book of Gold it is written\r\notherwise: ‘God preserve us from Satan who was stoned!’ ... Therefore,\r\nin the name of Allah! Now then, Heart of Flame, do your duty!”\r\n\r\nA burning flush leaped over Tressa’s features.\r\n\r\n“Is my soul, then, my own!”\r\n\r\n“It belongs to God,” said Sansa gravely.\r\n\r\n“And—Sanang?”\r\n\r\n“God is greatest.”\r\n\r\n“But—was God there—at the Lake of the Ghosts?”\r\n\r\n“God is everywhere. It is so written in the Book of Gold,” replied\r\nSansa, pressing her hands tenderly.\r\n\r\n“Recite the Fatha, Heart of Flame. Thy lips shall not stiffen; God\r\nlistens.”\r\n\r\nTressa rose in the sunset glory and stood as though dazed, and all\r\ncrimsoned in the last fiery bars of the declining sun.\r\n\r\nCleves also rose.\r\n\r\nSansa laughed noiselessly: “My lord would go whither thou goest, Heart\r\nof Fire!” she whispered. “And thy ways shall be his ways!”\r\n\r\nTressa’s cheeks flamed and she turned and looked at Cleves.\r\n\r\nThen Sansa rose and laid a hand on Tressa’s arm and on her husband’s:\r\n\r\n“Listen attentively. Tiyang Khan must be destroyed. The signal sounds\r\nwhen my lord’s rifle-shot makes a loud noise here among these trees.”\r\n\r\n“Can I prevail against the Tchor-Dagh?” asked Tressa, steadily.\r\n\r\n“Is not that event already in God’s hands, darling?” said Sansa softly.\r\nShe smiled and resumed her seat beside Selden, amid the drooping fern\r\nfronds.\r\n\r\n“Bid thy dear lord leave his rifle here,” she added quietly.\r\n\r\nCleves laid down his weapon. Selden pointed eastward in silence.\r\n\r\nSo they went together into the darkening woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the dusk of heavy foliage overhanging the garden, Tressa lay flat as\r\na lizard on the top of the wall. Beside her lay her husband.\r\n\r\nIn the garden below them flowers bloomed in scented thickets, bordered\r\nby walks of flat stone slabs split from boulders. A little lawn, very\r\ngreen, centred the garden.\r\n\r\nAnd on this lawn, in the clear twilight still tinged with the sombre\r\nfires of sundown, squatted a man dressed in a loose white garment.\r\n\r\nSave for a twisted breadth of white cloth, his shaven head was bare.\r\nHis sinewy feet were naked, too, the lean, brown toes buried in the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nTressa’s lips touched her husband’s ear.\r\n\r\n“Tiyang Khan,” she breathed. “Watch what he does!”\r\n\r\nShoulder to shoulder they lay there, scarcely daring to breathe. Their\r\neyes were fastened on the Mongol Sorcerer, who, squatted below on his\r\nhaunches, grave and deliberate as a great grey ape, continued busy with\r\nthe obscure business which so intently preoccupied him.\r\n\r\nIn a short semi-circle on the grass in front of him he had placed a\r\ndozen wild Ginseng roots. The roots were enormous, astoundingly shaped\r\nlike the human body, almost repulsive in their weird symmetry.\r\n\r\nThe Yezidee had taken one of these roots into his hands. Squatting\r\nthere in the semi-dusk, he began to massage it between his long,\r\nmuscular fingers, rubbing, moulding, pressing the root with caressing\r\ndeliberation.\r\n\r\nHis unhurried manipulation, for a few moments, seemed to produce no\r\nresult. But presently the Ginseng root became lighter in colour and\r\nmore supple, yielding to his fingers, growing ivory pale, sinuously\r\nlimber in a newer and more delicate symmetry.\r\n\r\n“Look!” gasped Cleves, grasping his wife’s arm. “_What_ is that man\r\ndoing?”\r\n\r\n“The Tchor-Dagh!” whispered Tressa. “Do you see what lies twisting\r\nthere in his hands?”\r\n\r\nThe Ginseng root had become the tiny naked body of a woman—a little\r\nivory-white creature, struggling to escape between the hands that had\r\ncreated it—dark, powerful, masterly hands, opening leisurely now, and\r\nreleasing the living being they had fashioned.\r\n\r\nThe thing scrambled between the fingers of the Sorcerer, leaped into\r\nthe grass, ran a little way and hid, crouched down, panting, almost\r\nhidden by the long grass. The shocked watchers on the wall could still\r\nsee the creature. Tressa felt Cleves’ body trembling beside her. She\r\nrested a cool, steady hand on his.\r\n\r\n“It is the Tchor-Dagh,” she breathed close to his face. “The Mongol\r\nSorcerer is becoming formidable.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, God!” murmured Cleves, “that thing he made is _alive_! I saw it. I\r\ncan see it hiding there in the grass. It’s frightened—breathing! It’s\r\nalive!”\r\n\r\nHis pistol, clutched in his right hand, quivered. His wife laid her\r\nhand on it and cautiously shook her head.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, “that is of no use.”\r\n\r\n“But what that Yezidee is doing is—is blasphemous——”\r\n\r\n“Watch him! His mind is stealthily feeling its way among the laws and\r\nsecrets of the Tchor-Dagh. He has found a thread. He is following it\r\nthrough the maze into hell’s own labyrinth! He has created a tiny thing\r\nin the image of the Creator. He will try to create a larger being now.\r\nWatch him with his Ginseng roots!”\r\n\r\nTiyang, looming ape-like on his haunches in the deepening dusk, moulded\r\nand massaged the Ginseng roots, one after another. And one after\r\nanother, tiny naked creatures wriggled out of his palms between his\r\nfingers and scuttled away into the herbage.\r\n\r\nAlready the dim lawn was alive with them, crawling, scurrying through\r\nthe grass, creeping in among the flower-beds, little, ghostly-white\r\nthings that glimmered from shade into shadow like moonbeams.\r\n\r\nTressa’s mouth touched her husband’s ear:\r\n\r\n“It is for the secret of Destruction that the Yezidee seeks. But first\r\nhe must learn the secret of creation. He is learning.... And he must\r\nlearn no more than he has already learned.”\r\n\r\n“That Yezidee is a living man. Shall I fire?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“I can kill him with the first shot.”\r\n\r\n“Hark!” she whispered excitedly, her hand closing convulsively on her\r\nhusband’s arm.\r\n\r\nThe whip-crack of a rifle-shot still crackled in their ears.\r\n\r\nTiyang had leaped to his feet in the dusk, a Ginseng root, half-alive,\r\nhanging from one hand and beginning to squirm.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the first moonbeam fell across the wall. And in its lustre\r\nTressa rose to her knees and flung up her right hand.\r\n\r\nThen it was as though her palm caught and reflected the moon’s ray, and\r\nhurled it in one blinding shaft straight into the dark visage of\r\nTiyang-Khan.\r\n\r\nThe Yezidee fell as though he had been pierced by a shaft of steel, and\r\nlay sprawling there on the grass in the ghastly glare.\r\n\r\nAnd where his features had been there gaped only a hole into the head.\r\n\r\nThen a dreadful thing occurred; for everywhere the grass swarmed with\r\nthe little naked creatures he had made, running, scrambling, scuttling,\r\ndarting into the black hole which had been the face of Tiyang-Khan.\r\n\r\nThey poured into the awful orifice, crowding, jostling one another so\r\nviolently that the head jerked from side to side on the grass, a\r\nwabbling, inert, soggy mass in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nAnd presently the body of Tiyang-Khan, Warden of the Rampart of Gog and\r\nMagog, and Lord of the Seventh Tower, began to burn with white fire—a\r\nlow, glimmering combustion that seemed to clothe the limbs like an\r\nincandescent mist.\r\n\r\nOn the wall knelt Tressa, the glare from her lifted hand streaming over\r\nthe burning form below.\r\n\r\nCleves stood tall and shadowy beside his wife, the useless pistol\r\nhanging in his grasp.\r\n\r\nThen, in the silence of the woods, and very near, they heard Sansa\r\nlaughing. And Selden’s anxious voice:\r\n\r\n“Arrak is dead. The Sou-Sou hangs across a rock, head down, like a shot\r\nsquirrel. Is all well with you?”\r\n\r\n“Tiyang is on his way to his star,” said Tressa calmly. “Somewhere in\r\nthe world his body has bid its mind farewell.... And so his body may\r\nlive for a little, blind, in mental darkness, fed by others, and locked\r\nin all day, all night, until the end.”\r\n\r\nSansa, at the base of the wall, turned to Selden.\r\n\r\n“Shall I bring my body with me, one day, my lord?” she asked demurely.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Sansa——” he whispered, but she placed a fragrant hand across his\r\nlips and laughed at him in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nIN THE FIRELIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the whole spiritual world was trembling under the thundering\r\nshock of the Red Surf pounding the frontiers of civilisation from pole\r\nto pole.\r\n\r\nUp out of the hell-pit of Asia had boiled the molten flood, submerging\r\nRussia, dashing in giant waves over Germany and Austria, drenching\r\nItaly, France, England with its bloody spindrift.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Red Rain was sprinkling the United States from coast to\r\ncoast, and the mindless administration, scared out of its stupidity at\r\nlast, began a frantic attempt to drain the country of the filthy flood\r\nand throw up barriers against the threatened deluge.\r\n\r\nIn every state and city Federal agents made wholesale arrests—too late!\r\n\r\nA million minds had already been perverted and dominated by the\r\nterrible Sect of the Assassins. A million more were sickening under the\r\nawful psychic power of the Yezidee.\r\n\r\nThousands of the disciples of the Yezidee devil-worshipers had already\r\nbeen arrested and held for deportation,—poor, wretched creatures whose\r\nminds were no longer their own, but had been stealthily surprised,\r\nseized and mastered by Mongol adepts and filled with ferocious hatred\r\nagainst their fellow men.\r\n\r\nYet, of the Eight Yezidee Assassins only two now remained alive in\r\nAmerica,—Togrul, and Sanang, the Slayer of Souls.\r\n\r\nYarghouz was dead; Djamouk the Fox, Kahn of the Fifth Tower was dead;\r\nYaddin-ed-Din, Arrak the Sou-Sou, Gutchlug, Tiyang Khan, all were dead.\r\nSix Towers had become dark and silent. From them the last evil thought,\r\nthe last evil shape had sped; the last wicked prayer had been said to\r\nErlik, Khagan of all Darkness.\r\n\r\nBut his emissary on earth, Prince Sanang, still lived. And at Sanang’s\r\nheels stole Togrul, Tougtchi to Sanang Noïane, the Slayer of Souls.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the United States there had been a cessation of the active campaign\r\nof violence toward those in authority. Such unhappy dupes of the\r\nYezidees as the I. W. W. and other radicals were, for the time,\r\nphysically quiescent. Crude terrorism with its more brutal outrages\r\nagainst life and law ceased. But two million sullen eyes, in which all\r\nindependent human thought had been extinguished, watched unblinking the\r\nwholesale arrests by the government—watched panic-stricken officials\r\nrushing hither and thither to execute the mandate of a miserable\r\nadministration—watched and waited in dreadful silence.\r\n\r\nIn that period of ominous quiet which possessed the land, the little\r\ngroup of Secret Service men that surrounded the young girl who alone\r\nstood between a trembling civilisation and the threat of hell’s own\r\nchaos, became convinced that Sanang was preparing a final and terrible\r\neffort to utterly overwhelm the last vestige of civilisation in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWhat shape that plan would develop they could not guess.\r\n\r\nJohn Recklow sent Benton to Chicago to watch that centre of infection\r\nfor the appearance there of the Yezidee Togrul.\r\n\r\nSelden went to Boston where a half-witted group of parlour-socialists\r\nat Cambridge were talking too loudly and loosely to please even the\r\nmost tolerant at Harvard.\r\n\r\nBut neither Togrul nor Sanang had, so far, materialised in either city;\r\nand John Recklow prowled the purlieus of New York, haunting strange\r\nbyways and obscure quarters where the dull embers of revolution always\r\nsmouldered, watching for the Yezidee who was the deep-bedded, vital\r\nroot of this psychic evil which menaced the minds of all\r\nmankind,—Sanang, the Slayer of Souls.\r\n\r\nRecklow’s lodgings were tucked away in Westover Court—three bedrooms, a\r\nparlour and a kitchenette. Tressa Cleves occupied one bedroom; her\r\nhusband another; Recklow the third.\r\n\r\nAnd in this tiny apartment, hidden away among a group of old buildings,\r\nthe very existence of which was unknown to the millions who swarmed the\r\nstreets of the greatest city in the world,—here in Westover Court, a\r\ndozen paces from the roar of Broadway, was now living a young girl upon\r\nwhose psychic power the only hope of the world now rested.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon had turned grey and bitter; ragged flakes still fell; a\r\npallid twilight possessed the snowy city, through which lighted trains\r\nand taxis moved in the foggy gloom.\r\n\r\nBy three o’clock in the afternoon all shops were illuminated; the south\r\nwindows of the Hotel Astor across the street spread a sickly light over\r\nthe old buildings of Westover Court as John Recklow entered the tiled\r\nhallway, took the stairs to the left, and went directly to his\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nHe unlocked the door and let himself in and stood a moment in the entry\r\nshaking the snow from his hat and overcoat.\r\n\r\nThe sitting-room lamp was unlighted but he could see a fire in the\r\ngrate, and Tressa Cleves seated near, her eyes fixed on the glowing\r\ncoals.\r\n\r\nHe bade her good evening in a low voice; she turned her charming head\r\nand nodded, and he drew a chair to the fender and stretched out his wet\r\nshoes to the warmth.\r\n\r\n“Is Victor still out?” he inquired.\r\n\r\nShe said that her husband had not yet returned. Her eyes were on the\r\nfire, Recklow’s rested on her shadowy face.\r\n\r\n“Benton got his man in Chicago,” he said. “It was not Togrul Kahn.”\r\n\r\n“Who was it?”\r\n\r\n“Only a Swami fakir who’d been preaching sedition to a little group of\r\ngreasy Bengalese from Seattle.... I’ve heard from Selden, too.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded listlessly and lifted her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Neither Sanang nor Togrul have appeared in Boston,” he said. “I think\r\nthey’re here in New York.”\r\n\r\nThe girl said nothing.\r\n\r\nAfter a silence:\r\n\r\n“Are you worried about your husband?” he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n“I am always uneasy when he is absent,” she said quietly.\r\n\r\n“Of course.... But I don’t suppose he knows that.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose not.”\r\n\r\nRecklow leaned over, took a coal in the tongs and lighted a cigar.\r\nLeaning back in his armchair, he said in a musing voice:\r\n\r\n“No, I suppose your husband does not realise that you are so deeply\r\nconcerned over his welfare.”\r\n\r\nThe girl remained silent.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Recklow softly, “he doesn’t dream you are in love\r\nwith him.”\r\n\r\nTressa Cleves did not stir a muscle. After a long silence she said in\r\nher even voice:\r\n\r\n“Do you think I am in love with my husband, Mr. Recklow?”\r\n\r\n“I think you fell in love with him the first evening you met him.”\r\n\r\n“I did.”\r\n\r\nNeither of them spoke again for some minutes. Recklow’s cigar went\r\nwrong; he rose and found another and returned to the fire, but did not\r\nlight it.\r\n\r\n“It’s a rotten day, isn’t it?” he said with a shiver, and dumped a\r\nscuttle of coal on the fire.\r\n\r\nThey watched the blue flames playing over the grate.\r\n\r\nTressa said: “I could no more help falling in love with him than I\r\ncould stop my heart beating.... But I did not dream that anybody knew.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think he ought to know?”\r\n\r\n“Why? He is not in love with me.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure, Mrs. Cleves?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He is wonderfully sweet and kind. But he could not fall in love\r\nwith a girl who has been what I have been.”\r\n\r\nRecklow smiled. “What have you been, Tressa Norne?”\r\n\r\n“You know.”\r\n\r\n“A temple-girl at Yian?”\r\n\r\n“And at the Lake of the Ghosts,” she said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“What of it?”\r\n\r\n“I can not tell you, Mr. Recklow.... Only that I lost my soul in the\r\nYezidee Temple——”\r\n\r\n“That is untrue!”\r\n\r\n“I wish it were untrue.... My husband tells me that nothing can really\r\nharm the soul. I try to believe him.... But Erlik lives. And when my\r\nsoul at last shall escape my body, it shall not escape the Slayer of\r\nSouls.”\r\n\r\n“That is monstrously untrue——”\r\n\r\n“No. I tell you that Prince Sanang slew my soul. And my soul’s ghost\r\nbelongs to Erlik. How can any man fall in love with such a girl?”\r\n\r\n“Why do you say that Sanang slew your soul?” asked Recklow, peering at\r\nher averted face through the reddening firelight.\r\n\r\nShe lay still in her chair for a moment, then turned suddenly on him:\r\n\r\n“He _did_ slay it! He came to the Lake of the Ghosts as my lover; he\r\nmeant to have done it there; but I would not have him—would not listen,\r\nnor suffer his touch!—I mocked at him and his passion. I laughed at his\r\nTchortchas. They were afraid of me!—”\r\n\r\nShe half rose from her chair, grasped the arms, then seated herself\r\nagain, her eyes ablaze with the memory of wrongs.\r\n\r\n“How dare I show my dear lord that I am in love with him when Sanang’s\r\nsoul caught my soul out of my body one day—surprised my soul while my\r\nbody lay asleep in the Yezidee Temple!—and bore it in his arms to the\r\nvery gates of hell!”\r\n\r\n“Good God,” whispered Recklow, “what do you mean? Such things can’t\r\nhappen.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? They do happen. I was caught unawares.... It was one golden\r\nafternoon, and Yulan and Sansa and I were eating oranges by the\r\nfountain in the inner shrine. And I lay down by the pool and _made the\r\neffort_—you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. My soul left my body asleep and I went out over the tops of\r\nthe flowers—idly, without aim or intent—as the winds blow in summer....\r\nIt was in the Wood of the White Moth that I saw Sanang’s soul flash\r\ndownward like a streak of fire and wrap my soul in flame!... And, in a\r\nflash, we were at the gates of hell before I could free myself from his\r\nembrace.... Then, by the Temple pool, among the oranges, I cried out\r\nasleep; and my terrified body sat up sobbing and trembling in Yulun’s\r\narms. But the Slayer of Souls had slain mine in the Wood of the White\r\nMoth—slain it as he caught me in his flaming arms.... And now you know\r\nwhy such a woman as I dare not bend to kiss the dust from my dear\r\nLord’s feet—Aie-a! Aie-a! I who have lost my girl’s soul to him who\r\nslew it in the Wood of the White Moth!”\r\n\r\nShe sat rocking in her chair in the red firelight, her hands framing\r\nher lovely face, her eyes staring straight ahead as though they saw\r\nopening before them through the sombre shadows of that room all the\r\ndread magic of the East where the dancing flame of Sanang’s blazing\r\nsoul lighted their path to hell through the enchanted forest.\r\n\r\nRecklow had grown pale, but his voice was steady.\r\n\r\n“I see no reason,” he said, “why your husband should not love you.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you my girl’s soul belonged to Sanang—was part of his, for an\r\ninstant.”\r\n\r\n“It is burned pure of dross.”\r\n\r\n“It is _burned_.”\r\n\r\nRecklow remained silent. Tressa lay deep in her armchair, twisting her\r\nwhite fingers.\r\n\r\n“What makes him so late?” she said.... “I sent my soul out twice to\r\nlook for him, and could not find him.”\r\n\r\n“Send it again,” said Recklow, fearfully.\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes the girl lay as though asleep, then her eyes unclosed\r\nand she said drowsily: “I can not find him.”\r\n\r\n“Did—did you learn anything while—while you were—away?” asked Recklow\r\ncautiously.\r\n\r\n“Nothing. There is a thick darkness out there—I mean a darkness\r\ngathering over the whole land. It is like a black fog. When the damned\r\npray to Erlik there is a darkness that gathers like a brown mist——”\r\n\r\nHer voice ceased; her hands tightened on the arms of her chair.\r\n\r\n“_That_ is what Sanang is doing!” she said in a breathless voice.\r\n\r\n“What?” demanded Recklow.\r\n\r\n“_Praying!_ That is what he is doing! A million perverted minds which\r\nhe has seized and obsessed are being concentrated on blasphemous\r\nprayers to Erlik! Sanang is directing them. Do you understand the\r\nterrible power of a million minds all _willing_, in unison, the\r\ndestruction of good and the triumph of evil? A million human minds!\r\nMore! For that is what he is doing. That is the thick darkness that is\r\ngathering over the entire Western world. It is the terrific\r\nmaterialisation of evil power from evil minds, all focussed upon the\r\nsingle thought that evil must triumph and good die!”\r\n\r\nShe sat, gripping the arms of her chair, pale, rigid, terribly alert,\r\ndreadfully enlightened, now, concerning the awful and new menace\r\nthreatening the sanity of mankind.\r\n\r\nShe said in her steady, emotionless voice: “When the Yezidee Sorcerers\r\ndesire to overwhelm a nomad people—some yort perhaps that has resisted\r\nthe Sheiks of the Eight Towers, then the Slayer of Souls rides with his\r\nBlack Banners to the Namaz-Ga or Place of Prayer.\r\n\r\n“Two marble bridges lead to it. There are fourteen hundred mosques\r\nthere. Then come the Eight, each with his shroud, chanting the prayers\r\nfor those dead in hell. And there the Yezidees pray blasphemously, all\r\ntheir minds in ferocious unison.... And I have seen a little yort full\r\nof Broad Faces with their slanting eyes and sparse beards, sicken and\r\ndie, and turn black in the sun as though the plague had breathed on\r\nthem. And I have seen the Long Noses and bushy beards of walled towns\r\nwither and perish in the blast and blight from the Namaz-Ga where the\r\nSlayer of Souls sat his saddle and prayed to Erlik, and half a million\r\nYezidees prayed in blasphemous unison.”\r\n\r\nRecklow’s head rested on his left hand. The other, unconsciously, had\r\ncrept toward his pistol—the weapon which had become so useless in this\r\nawful struggle between this girl and the loosened forces of hell.\r\n\r\n“Is that what you think Sanang is about?” he asked heavily.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I know it. He has seized the minds of a million men in America.\r\nEvery anarchist is to-day concentrating in one evil and supreme mental\r\neffort, under Sanang’s direction, to will the triumph of evil and the\r\ndoom of civilisation.... I wish my husband would come home.”\r\n\r\n“Tressa?”\r\n\r\nShe turned her pallid face in the firelight: “If Sanang has appointed a\r\nPlace of Prayer,” she said, “he himself will pray on that spot. That\r\nwill be the Namaz-Ga for the last two Yezidee Sorcerers still alive in\r\nthe Western World.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I wished to ask you,” said Recklow softly. “Will you try\r\nonce more, Tressa?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I will send out my soul again to look for the Namaz-Ga.”\r\n\r\nShe lay back in her armchair and closed her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Only,” she added, as though to herself, “I wish my dear lord were safe\r\nin this room beside me.... May God’s warriors be his escort. And surely\r\nthey are well armed, and can prevail over demons. Aie-a! I wish my lord\r\nwould come home out of the darkness.... Mr. Recklow?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Tressa.”\r\n\r\n“I thought I heard him on the stairs.”\r\n\r\n“Not yet.”\r\n\r\n“Aie-a!” she sighed and closed her eyes again.\r\n\r\nShe lay like one dead. There was no sound in the room save the soft\r\npurr of the fire.\r\n\r\nSuddenly from the sleeping girl a frightened voice burst: “Yulun!\r\nYulun! Where is that yellow maid of the Baroulass?... What is she\r\ndoing? That sleek young thing belongs to Togrul Kahn? Yulun! I am\r\nafraid of her! Tell Sansa to watch that she does not stir from the Lake\r\nof the Ghosts!... Warn that young Baroulass Sorceress that if she stirs\r\nI slay her. And know how to do it in spite of Sanang and all the\r\nprayers from the Namaz-Ga! Yulun! Sansa! Watch her, follow her, hearts\r\nof flame! My soul be ransom for yours! Tokhta!”\r\n\r\nThe girl’s eyes unclosed. Presently she stirred slightly, passed one\r\nhand across her forehead, turned her head toward Recklow.\r\n\r\n“I could not discover the Namaz-Ga,” she said wearily. “I wish my\r\nhusband would return.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nTHE PLACE OF PRAYER\r\n\r\n\r\nHer husband called her on the telephone a few minutes later:\r\n\r\n“Fifty-three, Six-twenty-six speaking! Who is this?”\r\n\r\n“V-sixty-nine,” replied his young wife happily. “Are you all right?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Is M. H. 2479 there?”\r\n\r\n“He is here.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. An hour ago I saw Togrul Khan in a limousine and chased him\r\nin a taxi. His car got away in the fog but it was possible to make out\r\nthe number. An empty Cadillac limousine bearing that number is now\r\nwaiting outside the 44th Street entrance to the Hotel Astor. The\r\ndoorman will hold it until I finish telephoning. Tell M. H. 2479 to\r\nsend men to cover this matter——”\r\n\r\n“Victor!”\r\n\r\n“Be careful! Yes, what is it?”\r\n\r\n“I beg you not to stir in this affair until I can join you——”\r\n\r\n“Hurry then. It’s just across the street from Westover Court——” His\r\nvoice ceased; she heard another voice, faintly, and an exclamation from\r\nher husband; then his hurried voice over the wire: “The doorman just\r\nsent word to hurry. The car number is N. Y. _015 F 0379_! I’ve got to\r\nrun! Good-b——”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe left the booth at the end of Peacock Alley, ran down the marble\r\nsteps to the left and out to the snowy sidewalk, passing on his way a\r\nyoung girl swathed to the eyes in chinchilla who was hurrying into the\r\nhotel. As he came to where the limousine was standing, he saw that it\r\nwas still empty although the door stood open and the engine was\r\nrunning. Around the chauffeur stood the gold laced doorman, the\r\ngorgeously uniformed carriage porter and a mounted policeman.\r\n\r\n“Hey!” said the latter when he saw Cleves,—“what’s the matter here?\r\nWhat are you holding up this car for?”\r\n\r\nCleves beckoned him, whispered, then turned to the doorman.\r\n\r\n“Why did you send for me? Was the chauffeur trying to pull out?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. A lady come hurrying out an’ she jumps in, and the shawfur\r\nhe starts her humming——”\r\n\r\n“A lady! Where did she go?”\r\n\r\n“It was that young lady in chinchilla fur. The one you just met when\r\nyou run out. Yessir! Why, as soon as I held up the car and called this\r\nhere cop, she opens the door and out she jumps and beats it into the\r\nhotel again——”\r\n\r\n“Hold that car, Officer!” interrupted Cleves. “Keep it standing here\r\nand arrest anybody who gets into it! I’ll be back again——”\r\n\r\nHe turned and hurried into the hotel, traversed Peacock Alley scanning\r\nevery woman he passed, searching for a slim shape swathed in\r\nchinchilla. There were no chinchilla wraps in Peacock Alley; none in\r\nthe dining-room where people already were beginning to gather and the\r\norchestra was now playing; no young girl in chinchilla in the waiting\r\nroom, or in the north dining-room.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, far across the crowded lobby, he saw a slender,\r\nbare-headed girl in a chinchilla cloak turn hurriedly away from the\r\nroom-clerk’s desk, holding a key in her white gloved hand.\r\n\r\nBefore he could take two steps in her direction she had disappeared in\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\nHe made his way through the packed lobby as best he could amid throngs\r\nof people dressed for dinner, theatre, or other gaiety awaiting them\r\nsomewhere out there in the light-smeared winter fog; but when he\r\narrived at the room clerk’s desk he looked for a chinchilla wrap in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nThen he leaned over the desk and said to the clerk in a low voice: “I\r\nam a Federal agent from the Department of Justice. Here are my\r\ncredentials. Now, who was that young woman in chinchilla furs to whom\r\nyou gave her door key a moment ago?”\r\n\r\nThe clerk leaned over his counter and, dropping his voice, answered\r\nthat the lady in question had arrived only that morning from San\r\nFrancisco; had registered as Madame Aoula Baroulass; and had been given\r\na suite on the fourth floor numbered from 408 to 414.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to arrest her?” added the clerk in a weird whisper.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Possibly. Have you the master-key?”\r\n\r\nThe clerk handed it to him without a word; and Cleves hurried to the\r\nelevator.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth floor the matron on duty halted him, but when he murmured\r\nan explanation she nodded and laid a finger on her lips.\r\n\r\n“Madame has gone to her apartment,” she whispered.\r\n\r\n“Has she a servant? Or friends with her?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.... I did see her speak to two foreign looking gentlemen in\r\nthe elevator when she arrived this morning.”\r\n\r\nCleves nodded; the matron pointed out the direction in silence, and he\r\nwent rapidly down the carpeted corridor, until he came to a door\r\nnumbered 408.\r\n\r\nFor a second only he hesitated, then swiftly fitted the master-key and\r\nopened the door.\r\n\r\nThe room—a bedroom—was brightly lighted; but there was nobody there.\r\nThe other rooms—dressing closet, bath-room and parlour, all were\r\nbrilliantly lighted by ceiling fixtures and wall brackets; but there\r\nwas not a person to be seen in any of the rooms—nor, save for the\r\nillumination, was there any visible sign that anybody inhabited the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nSwiftly he searched the apartment from end to end. There was no baggage\r\nto be seen, no garments, no toilet articles, no flowers in the vases,\r\nno magazines or books, not one article of feminine apparel or of\r\npersonal bric-a-brac visible in the entire place.\r\n\r\nNor had the bed even been turned down—nor any preparation for the\r\nnight’s comfort been attempted. And, except for the blazing lights, it\r\nwas as though the apartment had not been entered by anybody for a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nAll the windows were closed, all shades lowered and curtains drawn. The\r\nair, though apparently pure enough, had that vague flatness which one\r\nassociates with an unused guest-chamber when opened for an airing.\r\n\r\nNow, deliberately, Cleves began a more thorough search of the\r\napartment, looking behind curtains, under beds, into clothes presses,\r\nbehind sofas.\r\n\r\nThen he searched the bureau drawers, dressers, desks for any sign or\r\nclew of the girl in the chinchillas. There was no dust anywhere,—the\r\nhotel management evidently was particular—but there was not even a pin\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\nPresently he went out into the corridor and looked again at the number\r\non the door. He had made no mistake.\r\n\r\nThen he turned and sped down the long corridor to where the matron was\r\nstanding beside her desk preparing to go off duty as soon as the other\r\nmatron arrived to relieve her.\r\n\r\nTo his impatient question she replied positively that she had seen the\r\ngirl in chinchillas unlock 408 and enter the apartment less than five\r\nminutes before he had arrived in pursuit.\r\n\r\n“And I saw her lights go on as soon as she went in,” added the matron,\r\npointing to the distant illuminated transom.\r\n\r\n“Then she went out through into the next apartment,” insisted Cleves.\r\n\r\n“The fire-tower is on one side of her; the scullery closet on the\r\nother,” said the matron. “She could not have left that apartment\r\nwithout coming out into the corridor. And if she had come out I should\r\nhave seen her.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you she isn’t in those rooms!” protested Cleves.\r\n\r\n“She must be there, sir. I saw her go in a few seconds before you came\r\nup.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment the other matron arrived. There was no use arguing. He\r\nleft the explanation of the situation to the woman who was going off\r\nduty, and, hastening his steps, he returned to apartment 408.\r\n\r\nThe door, which he had left open, had swung shut. Again he fitted the\r\nmaster-key, entered, paused on the threshold, looked around nervously,\r\nhis nostrils suddenly filled with a puff of perfume.\r\n\r\nAnd there on the table by the bed he saw a glass bowl filled with a\r\nmass of Chinese orchids—great odorous clusters of orange and snow-white\r\nbloom that saturated all the room with their freshening scent.\r\n\r\nSo astounded was he that he stood stock still, one hand still on the\r\ndoor-knob; then in a trice he had closed and locked the door from\r\ninside.\r\n\r\n_Somebody_ was in that apartment. There could be no doubt about it. He\r\ndropped his right hand into his overcoat pocket and took hold of his\r\nautomatic pistol.\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes he stood so, listening, peering about the room from bed\r\nto curtains, and out into the parlour. There was not a sound in the\r\nplace. Nothing stirred.\r\n\r\nNow, grasping his pistol but not drawing it, he began another stealthy\r\ntour of the apartment, exploring every nook and cranny. And, at the\r\nend, had discovered nothing new.\r\n\r\nWhen at length he realised that, as far as he could discover, there was\r\nnot a living thing in the place excepting himself, a very faint chill\r\ngrew along his neck and shoulders, and he caught his breath suddenly,\r\ndeeply.\r\n\r\nHe had come back to the bedroom, now. The perfume of the orchids\r\nsaturated the still air.\r\n\r\nAnd, as he stood staring at them, all of a sudden he saw, where their\r\ntwisted stalks rested in the transparent bowl of water, something\r\nmoving—something brilliant as a live ember gliding out from among the\r\nmass of submerged stems—a living fish glowing in scarlet hues and\r\nwinnowing the water with grotesquely trailing fins as delicate as\r\nfilaments of scarlet lace.\r\n\r\nTo and fro swam the fish among the maze of orchid stalks. Even its eyes\r\nwere hot and red as molten rubies; and as its crimson gills swelled and\r\nrelaxed and swelled, tints of cherry-fire waxed and waned over its fat\r\nand glowing body.\r\n\r\nAnd vaguely, now, in the perfume saturated air, Cleves seemed to sense\r\na subtle taint of evil,—something sinister in the intense stillness of\r\nthe place—in the jewelled fish gliding so silently in and out among the\r\npallid convolutions of the drowned stems.\r\n\r\nAs he stood staring at the fish, the drugged odour of the orchids heavy\r\nin his throat and lungs, something stirred very lightly in the room.\r\n\r\nChills crawling over every limb, he looked around across his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThere was a figure seated cross-legged in the middle of the bed!\r\n\r\nThen, in the perfumed silence, the girl laughed.\r\n\r\nFor a full minute neither of them moved. No sound had echoed her low\r\nlaughter save the deadened pulsations of his own heart. But now there\r\ngrew a faint ripple of water in the bowl where the scarlet fish,\r\nsuddenly restless, was swimming hither and thither as though pursued by\r\nan invisible hand.\r\n\r\nWith the slight noise of splashing water in his ears, Cleves stood\r\nstaring at the figure on the bed. Under her chinchilla the girl seemed\r\nto be all a pale golden tint—hair, skin, eyes. The scant shred of an\r\nevening gown she wore, the jewels at her throat and breast, all were\r\nyellow and amber and saffron-gold.\r\n\r\nAnd now, looking him in the eyes, she leisurely disengaged the robe of\r\nsilver fur from her naked shoulders and let it fall around her on the\r\nbed. For a second the lithe, willowy golden thing gathered there as\r\ngracefully as a coiled snake filled him with swift loathing. Then,\r\nalmost instantly, the beauty of the lissome creature fascinated him.\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward and set her elbows on her two knees, and rested her\r\nface between her hands—like a gold rose-bud between two ivory petals,\r\nhe thought, dismayed by this young thing’s beauty, shaken by the dull\r\nconfusion of his own heart battering his breast like the blows of a\r\nrising tide.\r\n\r\n“What do you wish?” she inquired in her soft young voice. “Why have you\r\ncome secretly into my rooms to search—and clasping in your hand a\r\nloaded pistol deep within your pocket?”\r\n\r\n“Why have you hidden yourself until now?” he retorted in a dull and\r\nlaboured voice.\r\n\r\n“I have been here.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“Here!... Looking at you.... And watching my scarlet fish. His name is\r\nDzelim. He is nearly a thousand years old and as wise as a magician.\r\nLook upon him, my lord! See how rapidly he darts around his tiny\r\ncrystal world!—like a comet through outer star-dust, running the\r\neternal race with Time.... And—yonder is a chair. Will my lord be\r\nseated—at his new servant’s feet?”\r\n\r\nA strange, physical weariness seemed to weight his limbs and shoulders.\r\nHe seated himself near the bed, never taking his heavy gaze from the\r\nsmiling, golden thing which squatted there watching him so intently.\r\n\r\n“Whose limousine was that which you entered and then left so abruptly?”\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n“My own.”\r\n\r\n“What was the Yezidee Togrul Kahn doing in it?”\r\n\r\n“Did you see anybody in my car?” she asked, veiling her eyes a little\r\nwith their tawny lashes.\r\n\r\n“I saw a man with a thick beard dyed red with henna, and the bony face\r\nand slant eyes of Togrul the Yezidee.”\r\n\r\n“May my soul be ransom for yours, my lord, but you lie!” she said\r\nsoftly. Her lips parted in a smile; but her half-veiled eyes were\r\nbrilliant as two topazes.\r\n\r\n“Is that your answer?”\r\n\r\nShe lifted one hand and with her forefinger made signs from right to\r\nleft and then downward as though writing in Turkish and in Chinese\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n“It is written,” she said in a low voice, “that we belong to God and we\r\nreturn to him. Look out what you are about, my lord!”\r\n\r\nHe drew his pistol from his overcoat and, holding it, rested his hand\r\non his knee.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said hoarsely, “while we await the coming of Togrul Kahn, you\r\nshall remain exactly where you are, and you shall tell me exactly who\r\nyou are in order that I may decide whether to arrest you as an alien\r\nenemy inciting my countrymen to murder, or to let you go as a foreigner\r\nwho is able to prove her honesty and innocence.”\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed:\r\n\r\n“Be careful,” she said. “My danger lies in your youth and\r\nmine—somewhere between your lips and mine lies my only danger from you,\r\nmy lord.”\r\n\r\nA dull flush mounted to his temples and burned there.\r\n\r\n“I am the golden comrade to Heavenly-Azure,” she said, still smiling.\r\n“I am the Third Immaum in the necklace Keuke wears where Yulun hangs as\r\na rose-pearl, and Sansa as a pearl on fire.\r\n\r\n“Look upon me, my lord!”\r\n\r\nThere was a golden light in his eyes which seemed to stiffen the\r\nmuscles and confuse his vision. He heard her voice again as though very\r\nfar away:\r\n\r\n“It is written that we shall love, my lord—thou and I—this night—this\r\nnight. Listen attentively. I am thy slave. My lips shall touch thy\r\nfeet. Look upon me, my lord!”\r\n\r\nThere was a dazzling blindness in his eyes and in his brain. He swayed\r\na little still striving to fix her with his failing gaze. His pistol\r\nhand slipped sideways from his knee, fell limply, and the weapon\r\ndropped to the thick carpet. He could still see the glimmering golden\r\nshape of her, still hear her distant voice:\r\n\r\n“It is written that we belong to God.... Tokhta!...”\r\n\r\nOver his knees was settling a snow-white sheet; on it, in his lap, lay\r\na naked knife. There was not a sound in the room save the rushing and\r\nsplashing of the scarlet fish in its crystal bowl.\r\n\r\nBending nearer, the girl fixed her yellow eyes on the man who looked\r\nback at her with dying gaze, sitting upright and knee deep in his\r\nshroud.\r\n\r\nThen, noiselessly she uncoiled her supple golden body, extending her\r\nright arm toward the knife.\r\n\r\n“Throw back thy head, my lord, and stretch thy throat to the knife’s\r\nsweet edge,” she whispered caressingly. “No!—do not close your eyes.\r\nLook upon me. Look into my eyes. I am Aoula, temple girl of the\r\nBaroulass! I am mistress to the Slayer of Souls! I am a golden\r\nplaything to Sanang Noïane, Prince of the Yezidees. Look upon me\r\nattentively, my lord!”\r\n\r\nHer smooth little hand closed on the hilt; the scarlet fish splashed\r\nfuriously in the bowl, dislodging a blossom or two which fell to the\r\ncarpet and slowly faded into mist.\r\n\r\nNow she grasped the knife, and she slipped from the bed to the floor\r\nand stood before the dazed man.\r\n\r\n“This is the Namaz-Ga,” she said in her silky voice. “Behold, this is\r\nthe appointed Place of Prayer. Gaze around you, my lord. These are the\r\nshadows of mighty men who come here to see you die in the Place of\r\nPrayer.”\r\n\r\nCleves’s head had fallen back, but his eyes were open. The Baroulass\r\ngirl took his head in both hands and turned it hither and thither. And\r\nhis glazing eyes seemed to sweep a throng of shadowy white-robed men\r\ncrowding the room. And he saw the bloodless, symmetrical visage of\r\nSanang among them, and the great red beard of Togrul; and his\r\nstiffening lips parted in an uttered cry, and sagged open, flaccid and\r\nsoundless.\r\n\r\nThe Baroulass sorceress lifted the shroud from his knees and spread it\r\non the carpet, moving with leisurely grace about her business and\r\nsoftly intoning the Prayers for the Dead.\r\n\r\nThen, having made her arrangements, she took her knife into her right\r\nhand again and came back to the half-conscious man, and stood close in\r\nfront of him, bending near and looking curiously into his dimmed eyes.\r\n\r\n“Ayah!” she said smilingly. “This is the Place of Prayer. And you shall\r\nadd your prayer to ours before I use my knife. So! I give you back your\r\npower of speech. Pronounce the name of Erlik!”\r\n\r\nVery slowly his dry lips moved and his dry tongue trembled. The word\r\nthey formed was,\r\n\r\n“Tressa!”\r\n\r\nInstantly the girl’s yellow eyes grew incandescent and her lovely mouth\r\nbecame distorted. With her left hand she caught his chin, forced his\r\nhead back, exposing his throat, and using all her strength drew the\r\nknife’s edge across it.\r\n\r\nBut it was only her clenched fingers that swept the taut\r\nthroat—clenched and empty fingers in which the knife had vanished.\r\n\r\nAnd when the Baroulass girl saw that her clenched hand was empty, felt\r\nher own pointed nails cutting into the tender flesh of her own palm,\r\nshe stared at her blood-stained fingers in sudden terror—stared, spread\r\nthem, shrieked where she stood, and writhed there trembling and\r\nscreaming as though gripped in an invisible trap.\r\n\r\nBut she fell silent when the door of the room opened noiselessly behind\r\nher;—and it was as though she dared not turn her head to face the end\r\nof all things which had entered the room and was drawing nearer in\r\nutter silence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she saw its shadow on the wall; and her voice burst from her\r\nlips in a last shuddering scream.\r\n\r\nThen the end came slowly, without a sound, and she sank at the knees,\r\ngently, to a kneeling posture, then backward, extending her supple\r\ngolden shape across the shroud; and lay there limp as a dead snake.\r\n\r\nTressa went to the bowl of water and drew from it every blossom. The\r\nscarlet fish was now thrashing the water to an iridescent spume; and\r\nTressa plunged in her hands and seized it and flung it out—squirming\r\nand wheezing crimson foam—on the shroud beside the golden girl of the\r\nBaroulass. Then, very slowly, she drew the shroud over the dying\r\nthings; stepped back to the chair where her husband lay unconscious;\r\nknelt down beside him and took his head on her shoulder, gazing, all\r\nthe while, at the outline of the dead girl under the snowy shroud.\r\n\r\nAfter a long while Cleves stirred and opened his eyes. Presently he\r\nturned his head sideways on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Tressa,” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“Hush,” she whispered, “all is well now.” But she did not move her eyes\r\nfrom the shroud, which now outlined the still shapes of _two_ human\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\n“John Recklow!” she called in a low voice.\r\n\r\nRecklow entered noiselessly with drawn pistol. She motioned to him; he\r\nbent and lifted the edge of the shroud, cautiously. A bushy red beard\r\nprotruded.\r\n\r\n“Togrul!” he exclaimed.... “But who is this young creature lying dead\r\nbeside him?”\r\n\r\nThen Tressa caught the collar of her tunic in her left hand and flung\r\nback her lovely face looking upward out of eyes like sapphires wet with\r\nrain:\r\n\r\n“In the name of the one and only God,” she sobbed—“if there be no\r\nresurrection for dead souls, then I have slain this night in vain!\r\n\r\n“For what does it profit a girl if her soul be lost to a lover and her\r\nbody be saved for her husband?”\r\n\r\nShe rose from her knees, the tears still falling, and went and looked\r\ndown at the outlined shapes beneath the shroud.\r\n\r\nRecklow had gone to the telephone to summon his own men and an\r\nambulance. Now, turning toward Tressa from his chair:\r\n\r\n“God knows what we’d do without you, Mrs. Cleves. I believe this\r\naccounts for all the Yezidees except Sanang.”\r\n\r\n“Excepting Prince Sanang,” she said drearily. Then she went slowly to\r\nwhere her husband lay in his armchair, and sank down on the floor, and\r\nlaid her cheek across his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\nTHE SLAYER OF SOULS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that great blizzard which, on the 4th of February, struck the\r\neastern coast of the United States from Georgia to Maine, John Recklow\r\nand his men hunted Sanang, the last of the Yezidees.\r\n\r\nAnd Sanang clung like a demon to the country which he had doomed to\r\ndestruction, imbedding each claw again as it was torn loose, battling\r\nfor the supremacy of evil with all his dreadful psychic power, striving\r\nstill to seize, cripple, and slay the bodies and souls of a hundred\r\nmillion Americans.\r\n\r\nAgain he scattered the uncounted myriads of germs of the Black Plague\r\nwhich he and his Yezidees had brought out of Mongolia a year before;\r\nand once more the plague swept over the country, and thousands on\r\nthousands died.\r\n\r\nBut now the National, State and City governments were fighting, with\r\nphysicians, nurses, and police, this gruesome epidemic which had come\r\ninto the world from they knew not where. And National, State and City\r\ngovernments, aroused at last, were fighting the more terrible plague of\r\nanarchy.\r\n\r\nNation-wide raids were made from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from\r\nthe Gulf to the Lakes. Thousands of terrorists of all shades and\r\nstripes whose minds had been seized and poisoned by the Yezidees were\r\nbeing arrested. Deportations had begun; government agents were\r\neverywhere swarming to clean out the foulness that had struck deeper\r\ninto the body of the Republic than any one had supposed.\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed, at last, as though the Red Plague, too, was about to be\r\nstamped out along with the Black Death called Influenza.\r\n\r\nBut only a small group of Secret Service men knew that a resurgence of\r\nthese horrors was inevitable unless Sanang, the Slayer of Souls, was\r\ndestroyed. And they knew, too, that only one person in America could\r\nhope to destroy Sanang, the last of the Yezidees, and that was Tressa\r\nCleves.\r\n\r\nOnly by the sudden onset of the plague in various cities of the land\r\nhad Recklow any clew concerning the whereabouts of Sanang.\r\n\r\nIn Boston, then Washington, then Kansas City, and then New York the\r\nepidemic suddenly blazed up. And in these places of death the Secret\r\nService men always found a clew, and there they hunted Sanang, the\r\nYezidee, to kill him without mercy where they might find him.\r\n\r\nBut they never found Sanang Noïane; only the ghastly marks of his\r\npoisoned claws on the body of the sickened nation—only minds diseased\r\nby the Red Plague and bodies dying of the Black Death—civil and social\r\ncentres disorganized, disrupted, depraved, dying.\r\n\r\nWhen the blizzard burst upon New York, struggling in the throes of the\r\nplague, and paralysed the metropolis for a week, John Recklow sent out\r\na special alarm, and New York swarmed with Secret Service men searching\r\nthe snow-buried city for a graceful, slender, dark young man whose eyes\r\nslanted a trifle in his amber-tinted face; who dressed fashionably,\r\nlived fastidiously, and spoke English perfectly in a delightfully\r\nmodulated voice.\r\n\r\nAnd to New York, thrice stricken by anarchy, by plague, and now by God,\r\nhurried, from all parts of the nation, thousands of secret agents who\r\nhad been hunting Sanang in distant cities or who had been raiding the\r\ntraitorous and secret gatherings of his mental dupes.\r\n\r\nAgent ZB-303, who was volunteer agent James Benton, came from Boston\r\nwith his new bride who had just arrived by way of England—a young girl\r\nnamed Yulun who landed swathed in sables, and stretched out both lovely\r\nlittle hands to Benton the instant she caught sight of him on the pier.\r\nWhereupon he took the slim figure in furs into his arms, which was\r\ninteresting because they had never before met in the flesh.\r\n\r\nSo,—their honeymoon scarce begun, Benton and Yulun came from Boston in\r\nanswer to Recklow’s emergency call.\r\n\r\nAnd all the way across from San Francisco came volunteer agent XLY-371,\r\notherwise Alek Selden, bringing with him a girl named Sansa whom he had\r\ngone to the coast to meet, and whom he had immediately married after\r\nshe had landed from the Japanese steamer _Nan-yang Maru_. Which, also,\r\nwas remarkable, because, although they recognised each other instantly,\r\nand their hands and lips clung as they met, neither had ever before\r\nbeheld the living body of the other.\r\n\r\nThe third man who came to New York at Recklow’s summons was volunteer\r\nagent 53-6-26, otherwise Victor Cleves.\r\n\r\nHis young wife, suffering from nervous shock after the deaths of Togrul\r\nKhan and of the Baroulass girl, Aoula, had been convalescing in a\r\nprivate sanitarium in Westchester.\r\n\r\nUntil the summons came to her husband from Recklow, she had seen him\r\nonly for a few moments every day. But the call to duty seemed to have\r\neffected a miraculous cure in the slender, blue-eyed girl who had lain\r\nall day long, day after day, in her still, sunny room scarcely\r\nunclosing her eyes at all save only when her husband was permitted to\r\nenter for the few minutes allowed them every day.\r\n\r\nThe physician had just left, after admitting that Mrs. Cleves seemed to\r\nbe well enough to travel if she insisted; and she and her maid had\r\nalready begun to pack when her husband came into her room.\r\n\r\nShe looked around over her shoulder, then rose from her knees, flung an\r\narmful of clothing into the trunk before which she had been kneeling,\r\nand came across the room to him. Then she dismissed her maid from the\r\nroom. And when the girl had gone:\r\n\r\n“I am well, Victor,” she said in a low voice. “Why are you troubled?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t bear to have you drawn into this horrible affair once more.”\r\n\r\n“Who else is there to discover and overcome Sanang?” she asked calmly.\r\n\r\nHe remained silent.\r\n\r\nSo, for a few moments they stood confronting each other there in the\r\nstill, sunny chamber—husband and wife who had never even exchanged the\r\nfirst kiss—two young creatures more vitally and intimately bound\r\ntogether than any two on earth—yet utterly separated body and soul from\r\neach other—two solitary spirits which had never merged; two bodies\r\nvirginal and inviolate.\r\n\r\nTressa spoke first: “I must go. That was our bargain.”\r\n\r\nThe word made him wince as though it had been a sudden blow. Then his\r\nface flushed red.\r\n\r\n“Bargain or no bargain,” he said, “I don’t want you to go because I’m\r\nafraid you can not endure another shock like the last one.... And every\r\ntime you have thrown your own mind and body between this Nation and\r\ndestruction you have nearly died of it.”\r\n\r\n“And if I die?” she said in a low voice.\r\n\r\nWhat answer she awaited—perhaps hoped for—was not the one he made. He\r\nsaid: “If you die in what you believe to be your line of duty, then it\r\nwill be I who have killed you.”\r\n\r\n“That would not be true. It is you who have saved me.”\r\n\r\n“I have not. I have done nothing except to lead you into danger of\r\ndeath since I first met you. If you mean spiritually, that also is\r\nuntrue. You have saved yourself—if that indeed were necessary. You have\r\nredeemed yourself—if it is true you needed redemption—which I never\r\nbelieved——”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she sighed swiftly, “Sanang surprised my soul when it was free of\r\nmy body—followed my soul into the Wood of the White Moth—caught it\r\nthere all alone—and—slew it!”\r\n\r\nHis lips and throat had gone dry as he watched the pallid terror grow\r\nin her face.\r\n\r\nPresently he recovered his voice: “You call that Yezidee the Slayer of\r\nSouls,” he said, “but I tell you there is no such creature, no such\r\npower!\r\n\r\n“I suppose I—I know what you mean—having seen what we call souls\r\ndissociated from their physical bodies—but that this Yezidee could do\r\nyou any spiritual damage I do not for one instant believe. The idea is\r\nmonstrous, I tell you——”\r\n\r\n“I—I fought him—soul battling against soul——” she stammered, breathing\r\nfaster and irregularly. “I struggled with Sanang there in the Wood of\r\nthe White Moth. I called on God! I called on my two great dogs, Bars\r\nand Alaga! I recited the Fatha with all my strength—fighting\r\nconvulsively whenever his soul seized mine; I cried out the name of\r\nKhidr, begging for wisdom! I called on the Ten Imaums, on Ali the Lion,\r\non the Blessed Companions. Then I tore my spirit out of the grasp of\r\nhis soul—but there was no escape!—no escape,” she wailed. “For on every\r\nside I saw the cloud-topped rampart of Gog and Magog, and the woods\r\nrang with Erlik’s laughter—the dissonant mirth of hell——”\r\n\r\nShe began to shudder and sway a little, then with an effort she\r\ncontrolled herself in a measure.\r\n\r\n“There never has been,” she began again with lips that quivered in\r\nspite of her—“there never has been one moment in our married lives when\r\nmy soul dared forget the Wood of the White Moth—dared seek yours....\r\nGod lives. But so does Erlik. There are angels; but there are as many\r\ndemons.... My soul is ashamed.... And very lonely ... very lonely ...\r\nbut no fit companion—for yours——”\r\n\r\nHer hands dropped listlessly beside her and her chin sank.\r\n\r\n“So you believe that Yezidee devil caught your soul when it was\r\nwandering somewhere out of your body, and destroyed it,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, did not even lift her eyes until he had stepped\r\nclose to her—closer than he had ever come. Then she looked up at him,\r\nbut closed her eyes as he swept her into his arms and crushed her face\r\nand body against his own.\r\n\r\nNow her red lips were on his; now her face and heart and limbs and\r\nbreast melted into his—her breath, her pulse, her strength flowed into\r\nhis and became part of their single being and single pulse and breath.\r\nAnd she felt their two souls flame and fuse together, and burn together\r\nin one heavenly blaze—felt the swift conflagration mount, overwhelm,\r\nand sweep her clean of the last lingering taint; felt her soul,\r\nunafraid, clasp her husband’s spirit in its white embrace—clung to him,\r\nuplifted out of hell, rising into the blinding light of Paradise.\r\n\r\nFar—far away she heard her own voice in singing whispers—heard her lips\r\npronounce _The Name_—“Ata—Ata! Allahou——”\r\n\r\nHer blue eyes unclosed; through a mist, in which she saw her husband’s\r\nface, grew a vast metallic clamour in her ears.\r\n\r\nHer husband kissed her, long, silently; then, retaining her hand, he\r\nturned and lifted the receiver from the clamouring telephone.\r\n\r\n“Yes! Yes, this is 53-6-26. Yes, V-69 is with me.... When?...\r\nTo-day?... Very well.... Yes, we’ll come at once.... Yes, we can get a\r\ntrain in a few minutes.... All right. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nHe took his wife into his arms again.\r\n\r\n“Dearest of all in the world,” he said, “Sanang is cornered in a row of\r\nhouses near the East River, and Recklow has flung a cordon around the\r\nentire block. Good God! I _can’t_ take you there!”\r\n\r\nThen Tressa smiled, drew his head down, looked into his face till the\r\nclear blue splendour of her gaze stilled the tumult in his brain.\r\n\r\n“I alone know how to deal with Prince Sanang,” she said quietly. “And\r\nif John Recklow, or you, or Mr. Benton or Mr. Selden should kill him\r\nwith your pistols, it would be only his body you slay, not the evil\r\nthing that would escape you and return to Erlik.”\r\n\r\n“_Must_ you do this thing, Tressa?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I must do it.”\r\n\r\n“But—if our pistols cannot kill this sorcerer, how are you going to\r\ndeal with him?”\r\n\r\n“I know how.”\r\n\r\n“Have you the strength?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—the bodily and the spiritual. Don’t you know that I am already\r\npart of you?”\r\n\r\n“We shall be nearer still,” he murmured.\r\n\r\nShe flushed but met his gaze.\r\n\r\n“Yes.... We shall be but one being.... Utterly.... For already our\r\nhearts and souls are one. And we shall become of one mind and one body.\r\n\r\n“I am no longer afraid of Sanang Noïane!”\r\n\r\n“No longer afraid to slay him?” he asked quietly.\r\n\r\nA blue light flashed in her eyes and her face grew still and white and\r\nterrible.\r\n\r\n“Death to the body? That is nothing, my lord!” she said, in a hard,\r\nsweet voice. “It is written that we belong to God and that we return to\r\nHim. All living things must die, Heart of the World! It is only the\r\ndeath of souls that matters. And it has arrived at a time in the\r\nhistory of mankind, I think, when the Slayer of Souls shall slay no\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, flushed, withdrew her hand and went slowly across\r\nthe room to the big bay window where potted flowers were in bloom.\r\n\r\nFrom a window-box she took a pinch of dry soil and dropped it into the\r\nbosom of her gown.\r\n\r\nThen, facing the East, with lowered arms and palms turned outward:\r\n\r\n“There is no god but God,” she whispered—“the merciful, the\r\nlong-suffering, the compassionate, the just.\r\n\r\n“For it is written that when the heavens are rolled together like a\r\nscroll, every soul shall know what it hath wrought.\r\n\r\n“And those souls that are dead in Jehannum shall arise from the dead,\r\nand shall have their day in court. Nor shall Erlik stay them till all\r\nhas been said.\r\n\r\n“And on that day the soul of a girl that hath been put to death shall\r\nask for what reason it was slain.\r\n\r\n“Thus it has been written.”\r\n\r\nThen Tressa dropped to her knees, touched the carpet with her forehead,\r\nstraightened her lithe body and, looking over her shoulder, clapped her\r\nhands together sharply.\r\n\r\nHer maid opened the door. “Hasten with my lord’s luggage!” she cried\r\nhappily; and, still kneeling, lifted her head to her husband and\r\nlaughed up into his eyes.\r\n\r\n“You should call the porter for we are nearly ready. Shall we go to the\r\nstation in a sleigh? Oh, wonderful!”\r\n\r\nShe leaped to her feet, extended her hand and caught his.\r\n\r\n“Horses for the lord of the Yiort!” she cried, laughingly. “Kosh! Take\r\nme out into this new white world that has been born to-day of the ten\r\npurities and the ten thousand felicities! It has been made anew for you\r\nand me who also have been born this day!”\r\n\r\nHe scarcely knew this sparkling, laughing girl with her quick grace and\r\nher thousand swift little moods and gaieties.\r\n\r\nPorters came to take his luggage from his own room; and then her trunk\r\nand bags were ready, and were taken away.\r\n\r\nThe baggage sleigh drove off. Their own jingling sleigh followed; and\r\nTressa, buried in furs, looked out upon a dazzling, unblemished world,\r\nlying silvery white under a sky as azure as her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Keuke Mongol—Heavenly Azure,” he whispered close to her crimsoned\r\ncheek, “do you know how I have loved you—always—always?”\r\n\r\n“No, I did not know that,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Nor I, in the beginning. Yet it happened, also, from the beginning\r\nwhen I first saw you.”\r\n\r\n“That is a delicious thing to be told. Within me a most heavenly glow\r\nis spreading.... Unglove your hand.”\r\n\r\nShe slipped the glove from her own white fingers and felt for his under\r\nthe furs.\r\n\r\n“Aie,” she sighed, “you are more beautiful than Ali; more wonderful\r\nthan the Flaming Pearl. Out of ice and fire a new world has been made\r\nfor us.”\r\n\r\n“Heavenly Azure—my darling!”\r\n\r\n“Oh-h,” she sighed, “your words are sweeter than the breeze in Yian! I\r\nshall be a bride to you such as there never has been since the days of\r\nthe Blessed Companions—may their names be perfumed and\r\nsweet-scented!... Shall I truly be one with you, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“Mind, soul, and body, one being, you and I, little Heavenly Azure.”\r\n\r\n“Between your two hands you hold me like a burning rose, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Your sweetness and fire penetrate my soul.”\r\n\r\n“We shall burn together then till the sky-carpet be rolled up. Kosh! We\r\nshall be one, and on that day I shall not be afraid.”\r\n\r\nThe sleigh came to a clashing, jingling halt; the train plowed into the\r\ndepot buried in vast clouds of snowy steam.\r\n\r\nBut when they had taken the places reserved for them, and the train was\r\nmoving swifter and more swiftly toward New York, fear suddenly\r\noverwhelmed Victor Cleves, and his face grew grey with the menacing\r\ntumult of his thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed to comprehend him, too, and her own features became\r\nstill and serious as she leaned forward in her chair.\r\n\r\n“It is in God’s hands, Heart of the World,” she said in a low voice.\r\n“We are one, thou and I,—or nearly so. Nothing can harm my soul.”\r\n\r\n“No.... But the danger—to your life——”\r\n\r\n“I fear no Yezidee.”\r\n\r\n“The beast will surely try to kill you. And what can I do? You say my\r\npistol is useless.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.... But I want you near me.”\r\n\r\n“Do you imagine I’d leave you for a second? Good God,” he added in a\r\nstrangled voice, “isn’t there any way I can kill this wild beast? With\r\nmy naked hands——?”\r\n\r\n“You must leave him to me, Victor.”\r\n\r\n“And you believe you can slay him? _Do_ you?”\r\n\r\nShe remained silent for a long while, bent forward in her armchair, and\r\nher hands clasped tightly on her knees.\r\n\r\n“My husband,” she said at last, “what your astronomers have but just\r\nbegun to suspect is true, and has long, long been known to the\r\nSheiks-el-Djebel.\r\n\r\n“For, near to this world we live in, are other worlds—planets that do\r\nnot reflect light. And there is a dark world called Yrimid, close to\r\nthe earth—a planet wrapped in darkness—a black star.... And upon it\r\nErlik dwells.... And it is peopled by demons.... And from it comes\r\nsickness and evil——”\r\n\r\nShe moistened her lips; sat for a while gazing vaguely straight before\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“From this black planet comes all evil upon earth,” she resumed in a\r\nhushed voice. “For it is very near to the earth. It is not a hundred\r\nmiles away. All strange phenomena for which our scientists can not\r\naccount are due to this invisible planet,—all new and sudden\r\npestilences; all convulsions of nature; the newly noticed radio\r\ndisturbances; the new, so-called inter-planetary signals—all—all have\r\ntheir hidden causes within that black and demon-haunted planet long\r\nknown to the Yezidees, and by them called Yrimid, or Erlik’s World.\r\nAnd—it is to this black planet that I shall send Sanang, Slayer of\r\nSouls. I shall tear him from this earth, though he cling to it with\r\nevery claw; and I shall fling his soul into darkness—out across the\r\ngulf—drive his soul forth—hurl it toward Erlik like a swift rocket\r\ncharred and falling from the sky into endless night.\r\n\r\n“So shall I strive to deal with Prince Sanang, Sorcerer of Mount\r\nAlamout, the last of the Assassins, Sheik-el-Djebel, and Slayer of\r\nSouls.... May God remember him in hell.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready their train was rolling into the great terminal.\r\n\r\nRecklow was awaiting them. He took Tressa’s hands in his and gazed\r\nearnestly into her face.\r\n\r\n“Have you come to show us how to conclude this murderous business?” he\r\nasked grimly.\r\n\r\n“I shall try,” she said calmly. “Where have you cornered Sanang?”\r\n\r\n“Could you and Victor come at once?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” She turned and looked at her husband, who had become quite pale.\r\n\r\nRecklow saw the look they exchanged. There could be no misunderstanding\r\nwhat had happened to these two. Their tragedy had ended. They were\r\nunited at last. He understood it instantly,—realised how terrible was\r\nthis new and tragic situation for them both.\r\n\r\nYet, he knew also that the salvation of civilisation itself now\r\ndepended upon this girl. She must face Sanang. There was nothing else\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n“The streets are choked with snow,” he said, “but I have a coupé and\r\ntwo strong horses waiting.”\r\n\r\nHe nodded to one of his men standing near. Cleves gave him the hand\r\nluggage and checks.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he said in a low voice to Recklow; and passed one arm\r\nthrough Tressa’s.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coupé was waiting on Forty-second Street, guarded by a policeman.\r\nWhen they had entered and were seated, two mounted policemen rode ahead\r\nof the lurching vehicle, picking a way amid the monstrous snow-drifts,\r\nand headed for the East River.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got him somewhere in a wretched row of empty houses not far from\r\nEast River Park. I’m taking you there. I’ve drawn a cordon of my men\r\naround the entire block. He can’t get away. But I dared take no chances\r\nwith this Yezidee sorcerer—dared not let one of my men go in to look\r\nfor him—go anywhere near him,—until I could lay the situation before\r\nyou, Mrs. Cleves.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said calmly, “it was the only way, Mr. Recklow. There would\r\nhave been no use shooting him—no use taking him prisoner. A prisoner,\r\nhe remains as deadly as ever; dead, his mind still lives and breeds\r\nevil. You are quite right; it is for me to deal with Sanang.”\r\n\r\nRecklow shuddered in spite of himself. “Can you tear his claws from the\r\nvitals of the world, and free the sick brains of a million people from\r\nthe slavery of this monster’s mind?”\r\n\r\nThe girl said seriously:\r\n\r\n“Even Satan was stoned. It is so written. And was cast out. And dwells\r\nforever and ever in Abaddon. No star lights that Pit. None lights the\r\nBlack Planet, Yrimid. It is where evil dwells. And there Sanang Noïane\r\nbelongs.”\r\n\r\nAnd now, beyond the dirty edges of the snow-smothered city, under an\r\nicy mist they caught sight of the river where ships lay blockaded by\r\nfrozen floes.\r\n\r\nGulls circled over it; ghostly factory chimneys on the further shore\r\nloomed up gigantic, ranged like minarettes.\r\n\r\nThe coupé, jolting along behind the mounted policemen, struggled up\r\ntoward the sidewalk and stopped. The two horses stood steaming, knee\r\ndeep in snow. Recklow sprang out; Tressa gave him one hand and stepped\r\nlithely to the sidewalk. Then Cleves got out and came and took hold of\r\nhis wife’s arm again.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said harshly to Recklow, “where is this damned Yezidee\r\nhidden?”\r\n\r\nRecklow pointed in silence, but he and Tressa had already lifted their\r\ngaze to the stark, shabby row of abandoned three-story houses where\r\nevery dirty blind was closed.\r\n\r\n“They’re to be demolished and model tenements built,” he said briefly.\r\n\r\nA man muffled in a fur overcoat came up and took Tressa’s hand and\r\nkissed it.\r\n\r\nShe smiled palely at Benton, spoke of Yulun, wished him happiness.\r\nWhile she was yet speaking Selden approached and bent over her gloved\r\nhand. She spoke to him very sweetly of Sansa, expressing pleasure at\r\nthe prospect of seeing her again in the body.\r\n\r\n“The Seldens and ourselves have adjoining apartments at the Ritz,” said\r\nBenton. “We have reserved a third suite for you and Victor.”\r\n\r\nShe inclined her lovely head, gravely, then turned to Recklow, saying\r\nthat she was ready.\r\n\r\n“It makes no difference which front door I unlock,” he said. “All these\r\ntenements are connected by human rat-holes and hidden runways leading\r\nfrom one house to another.... How many men do you want?”\r\n\r\n“I want you four men,—nobody else.”\r\n\r\nRecklow led the way up a snow-covered stoop, drew a key from his\r\npocket, fitted it, and pulled open the door.\r\n\r\nA musty chill struck their faces as they entered the darkened and empty\r\nhallway. Involuntarily every man drew his pistol.\r\n\r\n“I must ask you to do exactly what I tell you to do,” she said calmly.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Recklow, caressing his white moustache and striving\r\nto pierce the gloom with his keen eyes.\r\n\r\nThen Tressa took her husband’s hand. “Come,” she said. They mounted the\r\nstairway together; and the three others followed with pistols lifted.\r\n\r\nThere was a vague grey light on the second floor; the broken rear\r\nshutters let it in.\r\n\r\nAs though she seemed to know her way, the girl led them forward, opened\r\na door in the wall, and disclosed a bare, dusty room in the next house.\r\n\r\nThrough this she stepped; the others crept after her with weapons\r\nready. She opened a second door, turned to the four men.\r\n\r\n“Wait here for me. Come only when I call,” she whispered.\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake take me with you,” burst out Cleves.\r\n\r\n“In God’s name stay where you are till you hear me call your name!” she\r\nsaid almost breathlessly.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly she turned, swiftly retracing her steps; and they saw\r\nher pass through the first door and disappear into the first house they\r\nhad entered.\r\n\r\nA terrible silence fell among them. The sound of her steps on the bare\r\nboards had died away. There was not a sound in the chilly dusk.\r\n\r\nMinute after minute dragged by. One by one the men peered fearfully at\r\nCleves. His visage was ghastly and they could see his pistol-hand\r\ntrembling.\r\n\r\nTwice Recklow looked at his wrist watch. The third time he said,\r\nunsteadily: “She has been gone three-quarters of an hour.”\r\n\r\nThen, far away, they heard a heavy tread on the stairs. Nearer and\r\nnearer came the footsteps. Every pistol was levelled at the first door\r\nas a man’s bulky form darkened it.\r\n\r\n“It’s one of my men,” said Recklow in a voice like a low groan. “Where\r\non earth is Mrs. Cleves?”\r\n\r\n“I came to tell you,” said the agent, “Mrs. Cleves came out of the\r\nfirst house nearly an hour ago. She got into the coupé and told the\r\ndriver to go to the Ritz.”\r\n\r\n“What!” gasped Recklow.\r\n\r\n“She’s gone to the Ritz,” repeated the agent. “No one else has come\r\nout. And I began to worry—hearing nothing of you, Mr. Recklow. So I\r\nstepped in to see——”\r\n\r\n“You say that Mrs. Cleves went out of the house we entered, got into\r\nthe coupé, and told the driver to go to the Ritz?” demanded Cleves,\r\nastounded.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Where is that coupé? Did it return?”\r\n\r\n“It had not returned when I came in here.”\r\n\r\n“Go back and look for it. Look in the other street,” said Recklow\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\nThe agent hurried away over the creaking boards. The four men gazed at\r\none another.\r\n\r\n“The thing to do is to obey her and stay where we are,” said Recklow\r\ngrimly. “Who knows what peril we may cause her if we move from——”\r\n\r\nHis words froze on his lips as Tressa’s voice rang out from the\r\ndarkness beyond the door they were guarding:\r\n\r\n“Victor I I—I need you! Come to me, my husband!”\r\n\r\nAs Cleves sprang through the door into the darkness beyond, Benton\r\nsmashed a window sash with all the force of his shoulder, and, reaching\r\nout through the shattered glass, tore the rotting blinds from their\r\nhinges, letting in a flood of sickly light.\r\n\r\nAgainst the bare wall stood Tressa, both arms extended, her hands flat\r\nagainst the plaster, and each hand transfixed and pinned to the wall by\r\na knife.\r\n\r\nA white sheet lay at her feet. On it rested a third knife. And, bending\r\non one knee to pick it up, they caught a glimpse of a slender young man\r\nin fashionable afternoon attire, who, as they entered with the crash of\r\nthe shattered window in their ears, sprang to his nimble feet and stood\r\nconfronting them, knife in hand.\r\n\r\nInstantly every man fired at him and the bullets whipped the plaster to\r\na smoke behind him, but the slender, dark skinned young man stood\r\nmotionless, looking at them out of brilliant eyes that slanted a\r\ntrifle.\r\n\r\nAgain the racket of the fusillade swept him and filled the room with\r\nplaster dust.\r\n\r\nCleves, frantic with horror, laid hold of the knives that pinned his\r\nwife’s hands to the wall, and dragged them out.\r\n\r\nBut there was no blood, no wound to be seen on her soft palms. She took\r\nthe murderous looking blades from him, threw one terrible look at\r\nSanang, kicked the shroud across the floor toward him, and flung both\r\nknives upon it.\r\n\r\nThe place was still dim with plaster dust and pistol fumes as she\r\nstepped forward through the acrid mist, motioning the four men aside.\r\n\r\n“Sanang!” she cried in a clear voice, “may God remember you in hell,\r\nfor my feet have spurned your shroud, and your knives, which could not\r\nscar my palms, shall never pierce my heart! Look out for yourself,\r\nPrince Sanang!”\r\n\r\n“Tokhta!” he said, calmly. “My soul be ransom for yours!”\r\n\r\n“That is a lie! My soul is already ransomed! My mind is the more\r\npowerful. It has already halted yours. It is conquering yours. It is\r\nseizing your mind and enslaving it. It is mastering your will, Sanang!\r\nYour mind bends before mine. You know it! You know it is bending. You\r\nfeel it is breaking down!”\r\n\r\nSanang’s eyes began to glitter but his pale brown face had grown almost\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n“I slew you once—in the Wood of the White Moth,” he said huskily.\r\n“There is no resurrection from such a death, little Heavenly Azure.\r\nLook upon me! My soul and yours are one!”\r\n\r\n“You are looking upon my soul,” she said.\r\n\r\n“A lie! You are in your body!”\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed. “My body lies asleep in the Ritz upon my husband’s\r\nbed,” she said. “My body is his, my mind belongs to him, my soul is\r\nalready one with his. Do you not know it, dog of a Yezidee? Look upon\r\nme, Sanang Noïane! Look upon my unwounded hands! My shroud lies at your\r\nfeet. And there lie the knives that could not pierce my heart! I am\r\nthrice clean! Listen to my words, Sanang! There is no other god but\r\nGod!”\r\n\r\nThe young man’s visage grew pasty and loose and horrible; his lips\r\nbecame flaccid like dewlaps; but out of these sagging folds of livid\r\nskin his voice burst whistling, screaming, as though wrenched from his\r\nvery belly:\r\n\r\n“May Erlik strangle you! May you rot where you stand! May your face\r\nbecome a writhing mass of maggots and your body a corruption of living\r\nworms!\r\n\r\n“For what you are doing to me this day may every demon in hell torment\r\nyou!\r\n\r\n“Have a care what you are about!” he screeched. “You are slaying my\r\nmind, you sorceress! You have seized my mind and are crushing it! You\r\nare putting out its light, you Yezidee witch!—you are quenching the\r\nlast spark—of reason—in—me——”\r\n\r\n“Sanang!”\r\n\r\nHis knife fell clattering to the floor. But he stood stock still, his\r\nhands clutching his head—stood motionless, while scream on scream tore\r\nthrough the loose and gaping lips, blowing them into ghastly, distorted\r\nfolds.\r\n\r\n“Sanang Noïane!” she cried in her clear voice, “the Eight Towers are\r\ndarkened! The Rampart of Gog and Magog is fallen! On Mount Alamout\r\nnothing is living. The minds of mankind are free again!”\r\n\r\nShe stepped forward, slowly, and stood near him chanting in a low voice\r\nthe Prayers for the Dead She bent down and unrolled the shroud, laid it\r\non his shoulders and drew it up and across his face, covering his dying\r\neyes, and swathed him so, slowly, from head to foot.\r\n\r\nThen she gathered up the three knives, cast them upward into the air.\r\nThey did not fall again. They disappeared. And all the while, under her\r\nbreath, the girl was chanting the Prayers for the Dead as she moved\r\nsilently about her business.\r\n\r\nShrouded to the forehead in its white cerements, the muffled figure of\r\nSanang stood upright, motionless as a swathed and frozen corpse.\r\n\r\nOutside, the daylight had become greyer. It had begun to snow again,\r\nand a few flakes blew in through the shattered windows and clung to the\r\nwinding sheet of Sanang.\r\n\r\nAnd now Tressa drew close to the shrouded shape and stood before it,\r\ngazing intently upon the outlined features of the last of the Yezidees.\r\n\r\n“Sanang,” she said very softly, “I hear your soul bidding your body\r\nfarewell. Tokhta!”\r\n\r\nThen, under the strained gaze of the four men gathered there, the\r\nshroud fell to the floor in a loose heap of white folds. There was\r\nnobody under it; no trace of Sanang. The human shape of the Yezidee had\r\ndisappeared; but a greyish mist had filled the room, wavering up like\r\nsmoke from the shroud, and, like smoke, blowing in a long streamer\r\ntoward the window where the draught drew it out through the falling\r\nsnow and scattered the last shred of it against the greying sky.\r\n\r\nIn the room the mist thinned swiftly; the four men could now see one\r\nanother. But Tressa was no longer in the room. And in place of the\r\nwhite shroud a piece of filthy tattered carpet lay on the floor. And a\r\ndead rat, flattened out, dry and dusty, lay upon it.\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake,” whispered Recklow hoarsely, “let us get out of this!”\r\n\r\nCleves, his pistol clutched convulsively, stared at him in terror. But\r\nRecklow took him by the arm and drew him away, muttering that Tressa\r\nwas waiting for him, and might be ill, and that there was nothing\r\nfurther to expect in this ghastly spot.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey went with Cleves to the Ritz. At the desk the clerk said that Mrs.\r\nCleves had the keys and was in her apartment.\r\n\r\nThe three men entered the corridor with him; watched him try the door;\r\nsaw him open it; lingered a moment after it had closed; heard the key\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the door closing the maid came.\r\n\r\n“Madame is asleep in her room,” she whispered.\r\n\r\n“When did she come in?”\r\n\r\n“More than two hours ago, sir. I have drawn her bath, but when I opened\r\nthe door a few moments ago, Madame was still asleep.”\r\n\r\nHe nodded; he was trembling when he put off his overcoat and dropped\r\nhat and gloves on the carpet.\r\n\r\nFrom the little rose and ivory reception room he could see the closed\r\ndoor of his wife’s chamber. And for a while he stood staring at it.\r\n\r\nThen, slowly, he crossed this room, opened the door; entered.\r\n\r\nIn her bedroom the tinted twilight was like ashes of roses. He went to\r\nthe bed and looked down at her shadowy face; gazed intently; listened;\r\nthen, in sudden terror, bent and laid his hand on her heart. It was\r\nbeating as tranquilly as a child’s; but as she stirred, turned her\r\nhead, and unclosed her eyes, under his hand her heart leaped like a\r\nwild thing caught unawares and the snowy skin glowed with an exquisite\r\nand deepening tint as she lifted her arms and clasped them around her\r\nhusband’s, neck, drawing his quivering face against her own.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] “Look out!” Nomad-Mongol dialect.\r\n\r\n[2] Urdu = An imperial encampment.\r\n\r\n[3] Mocalla = A platform used as a Moslem pulpit.",
