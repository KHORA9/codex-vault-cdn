Many of these plants play\r\nimportant parts in economic botany, yielding dye-stuffs, tanning\r\nmaterial, wax, varnish, and drugs. Several species are poisonous. At\r\nleast three poisonous species of the genus _Rhus_ are found in the\r\nUnited States. These three are all common and well-known plants, but\r\nconfusion frequently arises concerning them on account of the different\r\nnames by which they are known in different localities. For example,\r\npoison ivy (_Rhus toxicodendron_ or _Rhus radicans_) probably the best\r\nknown poisonous plant in America, being found in all the States except\r\nthose in the extreme West, is often confounded with and popularly called\r\n\"poison oak.\" The true poison oak is the _Rhus diversiloba_ of the\r\nWestern States.[1] The third and most poisonous species of this plant is\r\n_Rhus venenata_ or _Rhus vernix_; it is the _Rhus vernicifera_ of Japan,\r\nfrom which Japanese lac is obtained. It is popularly known in the United\r\nStates as \"poison sumach,\" \"poison dogwood\" and \"poison elder.\" It grows\r\nin swamps from Canada to Florida.\r\n\r\nAs the poison ivy is by far the most common of these plants in the\r\nEastern States, a brief description of it is given here:[2] A shrub\r\nclimbing by rootlets over rocks, etc., or ascending trees, or sometimes\r\nlow and erect; leaflets 3, rhombic-ovate, mostly pointed, and rather\r\ndowny beneath, variously notched, sinuate, or cut-lobed; high climbing\r\nplants (_R. radicans_) having usually more entire leaves. It is found in\r\nthickets, low grounds, etc. Greenish flowers appear in June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Poison ivy (_Rhus radicans_ or _Rhus\r\ntoxicodendron_). _a_, spray showing aerial rootlets and leaves; _b_,\r\nfruit--both one-fourth natural size.\r\n\r\n(Chesnut, Bulletin No. 20, Division of Botany, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Poison oak (_Rhus diversiloba_) showing leaves,\r\nflowers, and fruit, one-third natural size.\r\n\r\n(Chesnut, Bulletin No. 20, Division of Botany, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture.)]\r\n\r\nIn the general description of the order Anacardiaciae, Gray[3] says:\r\n\"Juice or exhalations often poisonous.\" Whether it is contact with some\r\npart of the plant, or with the exhalation from the plant, that causes\r\nthe well-known skin eruption has been a topic for discussion ever since\r\nits source was known. On account of its intangible nature there has been\r\nmore speculation than experimental evidence bearing on this question,\r\nalthough a few investigations have been made with the object of\r\nisolating the poison. It is most generally believed that the exhalations\r\nare poisonous. Dr. J. H. Hunt[4] states that the exhalations have been\r\ncollected in a jar and found to be capable of inflaming and blistering\r\nthe skin of an arm plunged into it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3--Poison sumach (_Rhus vernix_), showing leaves,\r\nfruit, and leaf-scars, one-fourth natural size.\r\n\r\n(Chesnut, Bulletin No. 20, Division of Botany, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture.)]\r\n\r\nProf. J. J. Rein,[5] in his treatise on Lacquer Work, describes the\r\npoison of the Japanese lac tree, _Rhus vernicifera_, as being volatile,\r\nas do also the Japanese chemist Yoshida[6] and the French chemist\r\nBertrand.[7] Recent work by Prof. A. B. Stevens,[8] however, seems to\r\nshow that this poison is not volatile, and is similar to, if not\r\nidentical with that obtained by Pfaff[9] from _Rhus toxicodendron_ and\r\n_Rhus venenata_.\r\n\r\nNot many cases of internal poisoning by _Rhus toxicodendron_ are on\r\nrecord in medical literature. Two cases of poisoning from eating the\r\nfruit of this plant have been described.[10] The subjects of these cases\r\nwere two children who had eaten nearly a pint of the fruit. The symptoms\r\nare described in detail, being in general, similar to those of\r\nalkaloidal poisoning. Warm water was given to promote emesis; afterwards\r\nlarge quantities of carbonate of soda were given in solution under the\r\nbelief that it was an antidote to the poison. Otherwise they were\r\ntreated on general principles. Both children recovered.\r\n\r\nAnother case of internal poisoning is the following:[11] Three children\r\ndrank an infusion of the root of poison ivy thinking it was sassafras\r\ntea. The first of these cases was diagnosed as measles, but on the\r\nappearance of similar symptoms in the sisters of the first patient, the\r\ncause of the trouble was found. All recovered.\r\n\r\nDr. Pfaff[12] explains the few fatal cases that have followed Rhus\r\npoisoning on the assumption that enough of the poison was absorbed\r\nthrough the skin to cause renal complications in persons having chronic\r\nkidney trouble. He showed that the poison, when given internally,\r\nproduces a marked effect on the kidneys, causing nephritis and fatty\r\ndegeneration of this organ.\r\n\r\nThe irritating action of poison ivy has been attributed at different\r\ntimes to the \"exhalation,\" to a volatile alkaloid, to a volatile acid,\r\nand to a non-volatile oil. Pfaff,[13] who made the most recent\r\ninvestigation of this poison, obtained from the plant a non-volatile oil\r\nhaving the same action on the skin as the plant itself. He found this\r\noil in all parts of the plant and concluded that it was the active\r\nprinciple, and that one could be poisoned only by actual contact with\r\nsome part of the plant. He assumed minute quantities of pollen dust to\r\nbe in the air to account for the cases of \"action at a distance\" so\r\nfrequently quoted. Pfaff says: \"In my opinion, it is more than doubtful\r\nif ever a case of ivy poisoning has occurred without direct contact with\r\nthe plant or with some article that has been in contact with the plant.\r\nThe long latent period of the eruption in some cases may obviously\r\nrender mistakes extremely easy as to the occasion when contact with the\r\nplant really occurred.\" Granting, however, that the active principle is\r\npractically non-volatile when isolated from the plant, we cannot say\r\npositively that it is not volatile in the juices of the plant, or under\r\nthe influence of vital forces. It is quite conceivable that the water\r\ntranspired by the leaves of the plant may carry with it a quantity of\r\nthe poison sufficient to produce the dermatitis on a person very\r\nsusceptible to its action. It is also conceivable that a volatile poison\r\nmanufactured by a living plant could become non-volatile by changes in\r\nit consequent upon the death of the plant.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time, only three important chemical investigations of\r\nthe active principle of _Rhus toxicodendron_ have appeared in medical\r\nand chemical literature, these being the researches of Dr. J. Khittel,\r\nJ. M. Maisch, a pharmacist, and Dr. Franz Pfaff, of the Harvard\r\nUniversity Medical School, to whose work reference has been frequently\r\nmade. The chemical work of these investigators and their conclusions are\r\ngiven here in some detail for the sake of completeness.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Chesnut. Bull. No. 20, U. S.

His work was published in _Wittstein's\r\nVierteljahrresschrift fuer praktische Pharmacie_, VII, 348-359.[14]\r\nKhittel obtained 37-1/2 ounces of fresh leaves of poison ivy from the\r\nbotanical garden in Munich, dried them, and got a residue of 9-1/2\r\nounces which he analyzed. Not detecting anything to which the poisonous\r\nqualities of the plant could be attributed, he made another series of\r\nexperiments which, as he thought, showed that a volatile alkaloid is the\r\npoisonous constituent. It was obtained by the following process: \"3\r\nounces of the powdered leaves were infused with hot distilled water,\r\nafter three days strained, expressed, the liquid evaporated to 3 ounces,\r\nand with the addition of potassa, carefully distilled to one-half. The\r\nclear, colorless distillate had an alkaline reaction, and an odor\r\nresembling henbane or hemlock. It was saturated with sulphuric acid,\r\nevaporated, and treated with a mixture of equal quantities of alcohol\r\nand ether which left sulphate of ammonia behind, the solution was\r\nevaporated spontaneously, distilled with potassa, the alkaline\r\ndistillate neutralized with hydrochloric acid, and a precipitate could\r\nnow be obtained with chloride of platinum. Want of material prevented\r\nfurther experiments.\"\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _American Journal of Pharmacy_ inserts the following\r\nnote: \"It would have been more satisfactory if the author had given some\r\nphysiological evidence of the poisonous nature of the alkaloid\r\nsubstance obtained. It is quite interesting to hear that the hitherto\r\nintangible venom of this plant has at last been detected.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] A free translation of this paper is given in Amer. Jour. Pharm. for\r\n1858, p. 542.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORK OF MAISCH.[15]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next investigation of this plant was made by Maisch in 1864. He\r\ncriticizes Khittel's experiments as follows: \"It is well known that the\r\n_exhalations_ of _Rhus toxicodendron_ exert a poisonous influence on the\r\nhuman body; the poisonous principle must, therefore, be volatile and, at\r\nthe same time, be naturally in such a loose state of combination as to\r\nbe continually eliminated and separated with the usual products of\r\nvegetable exhalations. It is natural to suppose that during the process\r\nof drying, the greatest portion of the poisonous principle should be\r\nlost. The loss must be still greater if the dried leaves are powdered, a\r\nhot infusion prepared from them, and this infusion evaporated down to\r\nthe original weight of the dried leaves. It is obvious that Dr. Khittel\r\ncould not have selected a better method for obtaining the least possible\r\nquantity of the poisonous principle, if, indeed, it could be obtained by\r\nthis process at all.\"\r\n\r\nMaisch then worked up 8-3/4 ounces of the leaves of the plant in a way\r\nto get the alkaloid, making some improvements on Khittel's method, but\r\nfailed to find it. Believing that the poison was a volatile acid, he\r\nenclosed some fresh leaves of the plant in a tin box with several test\r\npapers. The blue litmus paper became red showing the presence of an\r\nacid. He concluded from this experiment that the exhalations of the\r\nleaves contained a volatile organic acid which he thought was the\r\npoisonous substance. To determine this point, he prepared the acid in\r\nlarger quantity by macerating the leaves with water, expressing and\r\ndistilling the expressed juice. He was poisoned in doing this work\r\nalthough he had not been affected by handling the living plant and had\r\nconsidered himself immune. He obtained an acid which investigation\r\nshowed to be somewhat like formic acid, more like acetic acid, but\r\nhaving some reactions different from both. \"Taking all the reactions\r\ntogether, it is unquestionably a new organic acid for which I propose\r\nthe name of _Toxicodendric Acid_,\" writes Maisch. He further says: \"That\r\nit is the principle to which poison oak owes its effects on the human\r\nsystem was proved to my entire satisfaction by the copious eruption and\r\nformation of numerous vesicles on the back of my hand, on the fingers,\r\nwrists, and bare arms while I was distilling and operating with it.\r\nSeveral persons coming into the room while I was engaged with it were\r\nmore or less poisoned by the vapours diffused in the room; and I even\r\ntransferred the poisonous effects to some persons, merely by shaking\r\nhands with them.\r\n\r\n\"The diluted acid, as obtained by me, and stronger solutions of its\r\nsalts, were applied to several persons, and eruptions were produced in\r\nseveral instances, probably by the former, though not always, which was\r\nmost likely owing to the dilute state of the acid. Whenever this was\r\nboiled, I always felt the same itching sensation in the face, and on the\r\nbare arms, which I experience on continual exposure of my hands to the\r\njuice of the plant.\"\r\n\r\nToxicodendric acid was thought to be the active principle from the time\r\nof Maisch's work until the investigation by Pfaff in 1895.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] Proc. Amer. Pharm. Assn. 1865, p. 166, and Amer. Jour. Pharm. 1866,\r\np. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPFAFF'S WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy far the most valuable work on _Rhus toxicodendron_ is that of Pfaff.\r\nFrom a clinical study of Rhus poisoning, Pfaff came to the conclusion\r\nthat the poison must be a non-volatile skin irritant. The more volatile\r\nthe irritant, the quicker is its action on the skin. Formic acid acts\r\nvery quickly; acetic acid, less volatile than formic, acts more slowly,\r\nbut still much more quickly than poison ivy, the latent period of which\r\nis usually from two to five days. Pfaff thought that the volatile acid\r\nobtained by Maisch might have contained some of the poisonous principle\r\nas an impurity, but that it would not produce the dermatitis if prepared\r\nin a pure state. He therefore prepared a quantity of the acid by\r\ndistilling the finely divided fresh plant with steam. The yield was\r\nincreased by acidulating the mixture with sulphuric acid before the\r\ndistillation. The acid distillate so obtained was freed from a\r\nnon-poisonous oily substance by shaking the solution with ether. Barium\r\nand sodium salts were made by neutralizing the acid, and were purified\r\nby crystallization. Analysis showed them to be salts of acetic acid, and\r\nthey gave the characteristic tests for this acid. The toxicodendric acid\r\nof Maisch was thus shown to be acetic acid, and was therefore not the\r\npoisonous principle of the plant.\r\n\r\nPfaff obtained the active principle by the following process: The plant\r\nwas extracted with alcohol, the alcohol was distilled off, and the\r\nresidue was taken up in ether. The ether solution was washed with water\r\nand dilute sodium carbonate solution, and the ether was evaporated. An\r\noily, black, poisonous substance partly soluble in alcohol was obtained.\r\nTo get the active principle in a pure state, this residue was extracted\r\nwith alcohol and filtered and the filtrate was precipitated fractionally\r\nby lead acetate. The final precipitates consisted of the lead compound\r\nof the poison in a pure state. On decomposing the lead compounds with\r\nammonium sulphide, shaking out with ether, and letting the ether\r\nevaporate spontaneously, a non-volatile oil was obtained which gave the\r\ncharacteristic skin eruptions. The pure lead compounds made in different\r\npreparations were analyzed and assigned the formula C_{21}H_{30}O_{4}Pb.\r\nThe oil itself was not analyzed. Pfaff proposed the name _Toxicodendrol_\r\nfor the oil. He found that it was not volatile, was decomposed by heat,\r\nwas soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, benzene, etc., but insoluble\r\nin water. Its effects upon the human skin were studied in many\r\nexperiments upon himself and others. It was shown that an exceedingly\r\nminute quantity of the poison will produce the dermatitis, even 1/1000\r\nmilligram applied in olive oil being active. The oil was given\r\ninternally to rabbits, its effects being most marked on the kidneys.\r\n\r\nThe oil obtained by Pfaff from _Rhus venenata_ seemed to be identical\r\nwith that from _Rhus toxicodendron_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer's investigation was undertaken with the object of attempting\r\nto throw more light on the chemical nature of the poisonous substance\r\nfound in _Rhus toxicodendron_. Soon after commencing work, however, it\r\nbecame apparent that the poison could be more intelligently studied if\r\nthe substances associated with it in the plant were first identified;\r\nthe scope of the work was therefore extended to an investigation of the\r\nother constituents of the plant, and it was hoped that a knowledge of\r\nthe properties of these constituents would suggest a more economical way\r\nof getting the poison than the method of fractional precipitation.\r\n\r\nThe crude material for this work was prepared by Messrs. Parke, Davis &\r\nCo., of Detroit, Mich., according to special instructions submitted to\r\nthem: 67-1/2 pounds of fresh leaves and flowers of poison ivy were\r\ncollected near Detroit and carefully inspected by a competent botanist.\r\nThis material was thoroughly macerated and put into ten-liter bottles\r\nwith ether. The mass was thoroughly shaken, water being added to make it\r\nmore mobile. The ether was then separated off and the extraction was\r\nrepeated three times in the same way to insure complete removal of the\r\ntoxicodendrol. The ether extracts were combined, thoroughly dried with\r\nanhydrous sodium sulphate, and the ether was distilled off, the\r\ntemperature being kept below 40 deg. C. during the entire distillation.\r\nThe residue after the removal of the ether was a thick, black, tar-like\r\nmass, weighing 3 pounds 11 ounces. In extracting the plant, about\r\ntwenty-four gallons of ether were used. It is a significant fact in\r\nregard to the volatility of the poison that during the process of\r\npreparing this material none of the employees engaged in the work were\r\nin any way affected, since proper precautions were taken and the\r\nutensils were handled with rubber gloves.\r\n\r\nThe crude ether extract, which will be designated as the \"original\r\nmaterial,\" was shipped to Baltimore in August and was kept in a cool\r\nplace until November when the investigation was begun. When the bottle\r\nwas opened, there seemed to be an escape of a vapor, and a nauseating\r\nodor suggesting crushed green leaves pervaded the atmosphere. Some days\r\nlater, irregular red patches appeared on the face though a mask of\r\ncotton cloth was worn during the work, and the hands were protected by\r\nrubber gloves.\r\n\r\nAssuming from Pfaff's work that this original material contained the\r\nnon-volatile oil toxicodendrol, the first experiment was to try to\r\ndistil it out under diminished pressure. For this purpose, an Anschuetze\r\ndistilling bulb containing ten grams of the tar was connected with a\r\nvacuum pump. After a pressure of 2 mm. had been established the bulb was\r\ngradually heated in a bath of Wood's metal. Nothing distilled over. The\r\nmaterial began to carbonize at a temperature of 140 deg. to 150 deg.\r\n\r\nIt was then thought that perhaps the oil could be converted into an\r\nester which might be more volatile and could be distilled out. 20 grams\r\nof the original material were dissolved in 100 cc. of absolute alcohol\r\ncontaining 3 grains of hydrochloric acid gas, and the mixture was heated\r\n10 hours on a water-bath under a return condenser. After the heating,\r\nthe mixture had a delightful ethereal odor. The flask was corked and\r\nleft standing several weeks while other work was in progress. The ester\r\nsolution was then put in a vacuum desiccator over sulphuric acid and the\r\nalcohol evaporated. A black, tarry, solid mass was left having the ester\r\nodor. It was extracted with warm water and filtered from insoluble tar.\r\nThe filtrate had a green color and the ethereal odor. It was shaken out\r\nwith ether; the ether layer had a blood-red color while the water layer\r\nwas deep green. The extraction with ether was continued until the water\r\nlayer was no longer green. The combined ether extracts were evaporated\r\nin a desiccator without heat. A black tar-like solid was left very much\r\nlike the original material, but it had the ester odor. It was partly\r\nsoluble in water and readily soluble in alcohol. The alcoholic solution\r\nwas tested on the skin and found to be not poisonous. The ester, or\r\nmixture of esters, was not investigated further in this connection, but\r\nwas later shown to give the reactions for gallic acid and methyl\r\nfurfurol. These reactions will be referred to in connection with other\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nAfter a few other preliminary experiments, it became evident that the\r\noriginal material was a complex mixture of substances and that it would\r\nhave to be fractionated by some means and the fractions studied\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nA portion of the original substance was treated with 50 per cent.\r\nalcohol and was found to be partly soluble in this medium. The solution\r\nwas filtered from insoluble tar. A portion of the yellow filtrate gave a\r\nreddish yellow precipitate with lead acetate. The alcoholic solution was\r\ndistilled in an Anschuetze flask under diminished pressure; a yellow\r\nliquid condensed in the arm of the flask while most of the alcohol was\r\ncollected in a bottle connected with the arm. The yellow liquid was acid\r\nto litmus. Water was added, the solution was shaken out with ether and\r\nthe ether was evaporated. When the small residue was completely dry, it\r\nwas a yellow solid soluble in dilute alcohol and acid to litmus. The\r\nsubstance was not volatile enough to justify the use of this method for\r\ngetting it.\r\n\r\nChlorophyll could not be removed from the original substance because the\r\nsolvents for chlorophyll such as alcohol, ether, fats, petroleum, and\r\ncarbon bisulphide dissolve large quantities of the mixture.\r\n\r\nA precipitate obtained by adding lead acetate to a filtered solution of\r\nthe original substance in 50 per cent. alcohol was suspended in water,\r\ndecomposed by hydrogen sulphide, shaken out with ether and the ether\r\nevaporated. The residue appeared at first to be a yellow oil, but on\r\ncomplete evaporation of the ether in a desiccator, a yellow solid was\r\nobtained--apparently the same as that obtained by vacuum distillation.\r\n\r\nA solution of the original material in 50 per cent. alcohol was filtered\r\nthrough bone-black and the filtrate was colorless. Examination showed\r\nthat everything had been removed by the bone-black and the filtrate was\r\napparently pure alcohol and water.\r\n\r\nIn precipitating an alcoholic solution of the crude material with a\r\nsolution of lead acetate, it was noticed that at least two kinds of\r\nprecipitates were formed. The part that went down first was darker in\r\ncolor than that thrown down later. Pfaff used the last fractions in\r\nobtaining his oil and stated that these precipitates consisted of the\r\nlead compound of the oil in a pure state. It was found by experiment\r\nthat the darker part was soluble in ether while the lighter part was\r\nnot. This indicated that the darker part consisted of tarry matter which\r\nwas brought down mechanically or separated out when the alcoholic\r\nsolution was diluted by the lead acetate solution, or was perhaps a lead\r\ncompound soluble in ether. To test this point an experiment was made as\r\nfollows: Some of the crude material was thoroughly extracted with 50 per\r\ncent. alcohol. The tar insoluble in 50 per cent. alcohol was then\r\ntreated with 95 per cent. alcohol; most of it dissolved; the solution\r\nwas filtered and lead acetate in 50 per cent. alcohol was added. A\r\ngreenish colored precipitate was formed which was filtered off and found\r\nto be completely soluble in ether and soluble to a considerable extent\r\nin strong alcohol. These experiments suggested that the light colored\r\nlead compound which was thought to contain the poison could be purified\r\nby extraction with ether in a Soxhlet apparatus more conveniently than\r\nby the tedious process of fractional precipitation. Further preliminary\r\nexperiments showed that 50 per cent. alcohol extracted from the original\r\nmaterial all of the substance or substances which gave the light colored\r\nprecipitate and dissolved only a small amount of the tar.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and eighty-eight grams of the crude material were then\r\nextracted several times with 50 per cent. alcohol and filtered; the\r\ninsoluble tar was washed and saved for examination. To the filtrate was\r\nadded an excess of a solution of lead acetate in 50 per cent. alcohol.\r\nThe large precipitate, which will be designated as \"precipitate A,\" was\r\nfiltered and drained by suction in a Buechner funnel. The alcoholic\r\n\"filtrate A\" was saved. Precipitate A was extracted with ether in\r\nSoxhlet extractors until the ether came over practically colorless, the\r\noperation being interrupted from time to time to stir up the precipitate\r\nin the thimble. The green colored ether solution was saved for future\r\nexamination. The lead precipitate, after extraction with ether and\r\ndrying, weighed about 116 grams. A portion of this lead compound was\r\ndecomposed by hydrogen sulphide in a mixture of water and ether which\r\nwas well shaken during the operation. The ether was separated, filtered,\r\nand evaporated under diminished pressure without heat, and there\r\nremained a yellow oily looking residue having a pleasant odor. When the\r\nether and water were completely removed in a vacuum desiccator, a hard,\r\nbrittle, yellow resin weighing about 16 grams was obtained. It was\r\nsoluble in alcohol, had a strong acid reaction and was free from\r\nnitrogen[16] and sulphur. The nitrogen tests were made by the Lassaign\r\nand soda lime methods,[17] and the sulphur test was made with sodium\r\nnitroprusside after fusing the residue with sodium. The main portion of\r\nthe lead compound was decomposed under alcohol by hydrogen sulphide,\r\nfiltered, and the alcoholic filtrate evaporated in vacuo. The same\r\nyellow acid resin was obtained. Experiments continuing through several\r\nweeks were made in applying solutions of this resin to rats, rabbits and\r\nguinea pigs. Finding it to be without effect upon these animals it was\r\ntried on the writer and found to be not poisonous.[18] In the meantime\r\nthe resin was being studied in the laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALLIC ACID.\r\n\r\nAn alcoholic solution of the resin was just neutralized with potassium\r\nhydroxide. During the titration, the solution rapidly became dark brown.\r\nAfter neutralization it was shaken with ether; the water solution\r\nremained brown while the ether layer was nearly colorless and contained\r\npractically no dissolved substance. A portion of the water solution of\r\nthe potassium salt on being acidified with sulphuric acid and standing\r\nover night, deposited a slight precipitate. The solution of the\r\npotassium salt gave a heavy precipitate with lead acetate somewhat\r\nsimilar to the original lead precipitate A, and also slight precipitates\r\nwith salts of zinc, mercury, copper, and silver (with reduction). It\r\ngave a bluish-black color with impure ferrous sulphate and a dark color\r\nwith ferric chloride. It reduced ammoniacal silver nitrate and Fehling\r\nsolution. These experiments indicated the presence of a tannin compound.\r\nAn alcoholic solution of the resin gave the same color reactions with\r\niron salts as did the potassium salt. To determine which one of the\r\ntannin compounds was present was a matter of some difficulty since the\r\ndi- and tri-hydroxybenzoic acids have in general the same color\r\nreactions. The presence of other plant substances in the solution also\r\ninterferes with the color tests, and finally, a substance which gives a\r\nblue color with iron salts and one giving a green color may be found\r\ntogether in the same plant.[19] Further tests with a solution of the\r\nresin in dilute alcohol, and with a water solution of the acid\r\nprecipitated by adding sulphuric acid to a solution of the resin in\r\npotassium hydroxide, led to the conclusion that the acid is gallic acid.\r\nThese tests were the following:\r\n\r\n(1) Boiling with an excess of potassium hydroxide gave a black substance\r\n(tauromelanic acid).\r\n\r\n(2) The acid was not precipitated by gelatin.\r\n\r\n(3) On addition of potassium cyanide a transitory red color appeared\r\nwhich reappeared on shaking with air.\r\n\r\nGallic acid is distinguished from tannic acid by tests (2) and (3). At\r\nlater stages in the work the potassium, barium, and sodium salts of\r\ngallic acid were obtained, and finally the pure acid was made by\r\ndecomposing the sodium salt with sulphuric acid and crystallizing from\r\nwater. A portion of the acid so obtained was further purified by\r\ndissolving in absolute alcohol and pouring into absolute ether.[20] The\r\nmelting point behavior of the acid corresponds with that of gallic acid;\r\nit melted with decomposition at about 230 deg. For further identification,\r\nsome of the acid was converted into an ester by the following process:\r\nit was dissolved in 80 per cent. alcohol, hydrochloric acid gas was\r\npassed in, and the solution was heated an hour on the water bath. It was\r\nthen evaporated to a small bulk, neutralized with barium carbonate and\r\nextracted with ether. The ether, on evaporation, left the ester which\r\nwas crystallized from water and dried in a desiccator over sulphuric\r\nacid. The anhydrous ester agreed in melting point (156 deg. to 159 deg.) and\r\nother properties with the ester of gallic acid described by Grimaux.[21]\r\nFor the sake of comparison, an ester was made from gallic acid obtained\r\nfrom another source and the two agreed in properties. A mixture of the\r\ntwo esters melted within the limits given for the ester of gallic acid.\r\n\r\nWhile the tests leading to the identification of gallic acid were being\r\nmade, another series of experiments was in progress. Eleven and one-half\r\ngrams of the resin obtained from lead precipitate A by decomposition\r\nwith hydrogen sulphide were treated with 0.1 n. potassium hydroxide\r\nadded from a burette until the acid was exactly neutralized. All went\r\ninto solution. On shaking with ether, some of the potassium salt\r\nseparated out and was saved for examination. The solution became brown\r\non exposure to air and got darker as the work proceeded. The acid in\r\nsolution as a potassium salt was precipitated out in four fractions by\r\nadding for each fraction one-fourth the amount of 0.1 n. sulphuric acid\r\nrequired to neutralize the potassium hydroxide used. The precipitates\r\nwere filtered off and examined. The first was small in amount, gummy and\r\nhard to filter. The solution was shaken with ether after each\r\nprecipitate had been filtered off. The succeeding precipitates were in\r\nbetter condition, but were not pure. All appeared to be impure gallic\r\nacid which had become brown by absorption of oxygen. They were saved,\r\nhowever, to be tested for poison. After the last fraction had separated,\r\nthe filtrate was shaken several times with ether and saved for further\r\nexamination, which will be described under \"Rhamnose.\" This filtrate is\r\ndesignated as B.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the work a portion of the resin obtained from lead\r\nprecipitate A was tested and found to be not poisonous as already\r\nmentioned. By this test, all the substances contained in the lead\r\nprecipitate A after its extraction with ether in the Soxhlet apparatus,\r\nwere eliminated from the possible poisonous substances. The poison must\r\ntherefore have been extracted by the ether.\r\n\r\nA fresh portion of the original poisonous material was treated with 50\r\nper cent. alcohol and filtered from insoluble tar. The filtrate was\r\nprecipitated in six fractions by lead acetate. The last fractions were\r\nlighter in color and apparently much purer than the first. The sixth\r\nlead precipitate was decomposed by hydrogen sulphide, the light-yellow\r\nwater solution was tested and found to be not poisonous. It gave the\r\ncharacteristic reactions for gallic acid. The poison, if precipitated at\r\nall by lead acetate, must have gone down in one of the preceding\r\nfractions. Later experiments showed that it is brought down partly\r\nmechanically and partly as a lead compound in the first precipitates.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISETIN.\r\n\r\nHaving identified gallic acid, and not finding any other phenol\r\nderivative in the lead precipitate, some of the original material was\r\nextracted with hot water to remove gallic acid and filtered from tar\r\nwhile hot. The filtrate had a deep yellow color. On cooling over night,\r\nan olive green precipitate separated out which was dried and found to be\r\na light powder. It was practically insoluble in cold water, soluble\r\nwith great difficulty in boiling water from which it separated in yellow\r\nflakes, slightly soluble in ether and in acetic acid, but readily\r\nsoluble in alcohol. The solutions were not acid to litmus, gave a dark\r\ncolor with ferric chloride, an orange-red precipitate with lead acetate\r\nwhich was easily soluble in acetic acid, and an orange-yellow\r\nprecipitate with stannous chloride. These properties and reactions\r\nindicated that the substance was the dye-stuff fisetin and that it\r\noccurs in the free state in this plant though it is usually found as a\r\nglucoside of fisetin combined with tannic acid. A compound of this kind\r\nwas found in _Rhus cotinus_ and named \"fustin-tannide\" by Schmid[22]. He\r\nshowed that the fustin-tannide could be decomposed by acetic acid into\r\ntannic acid and a glucoside, fustin C_{46}H_{42}O_{21}. Fustin, on\r\nheating with dilute sulphuric acid, gave fisetin and a sugar supposed to\r\nbe rhamnose. Fisetin was also found as a glucoside compound in _Rhus\r\nrhodanthema_ by Perkin.[23]\r\n\r\nThe yellow substance which separated from the boiling water solution was\r\nfurther purified by dissolving in a small quantity of hot alcohol and\r\nadding hot water. On cooling, the yellow substance separated out in a\r\nflocculent condition. Examined under the microscope, the flakes appeared\r\nto be made up of masses of fine crystals.\r\n\r\nAn alcoholic solution of the substance gave a black color with ammonia\r\nwhich became red on addition of more ammonia. Concentrated acids\r\nintensified the yellow color of the alcoholic solution. Fehling solution\r\nand ammoniacal silver nitrate were reduced by it. Potassium hydroxide\r\nadded to an alcoholic solution gave at first a deep red color\r\naccompanied by a green fluorescence which disappeared, leaving a yellow\r\nliquid. With an excess of caustic potash, the red color returned and was\r\npermanent. These reactions are characteristic for fisetin.[24]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, fisetin should give protocatechuic acid and phloroglucinol\r\nby fusion with caustic potash under proper conditions.[25] The\r\nexperiment was carried out as follows: 2 grams of fisetin were gently\r\nheated in a nickel crucible with 6 grams of caustic potash dissolved in\r\n6 cc. water. An inflammable gas, apparently hydrogen, was evolved during\r\nthe fusion. The pasty mass was dissolved in water, acidified with\r\nsulphuric acid, and filtered. The filtrate was shaken out with ether\r\ncontaining one-fourth its volume of alcohol. The ether was evaporated\r\nand the residue was extracted with warm water and filtered. Lead acetate\r\nwas added to the filtrate to precipitate protocatechuic acid, while\r\nphloroglucinol remained in the filtrate from this precipitate. The lead\r\nprecipitate was suspended in water, decomposed by hydrogen sulphide,\r\nfiltered, and evaporated to obtain protocatechuic acid. That the\r\nsubstance obtained was protocatechuic acid was shown by the following\r\ncharacteristic tests:\r\n\r\n(1) It gave a greenish brown color with ferric chloride; on addition of\r\none drop of a dilute solution of sodium carbonate, the color became dark\r\nblue; on adding more sodium carbonate the color became red.\r\n\r\n(2) A violet color was obtained when a solution of the acid was treated\r\nwith a drop of sodium carbonate solution and then with a drop of ferrous\r\nsulphate.\r\n\r\n(3) It reduced ammoniacal silver nitrate.\r\n\r\n(4) It did not reduce Fehling solution.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate supposed to contain phloroglucinol was treated with\r\nhydrogen sulphide to remove lead, filtered, and shaken with ether. The\r\nresidue left on evaporating the ether was taken up in water. This\r\nsolution gave the following reactions characteristic for phloroglucinol:\r\n\r\n(1) It reduced both silver nitrate and Fehling solution.\r\n\r\n(2) It colored pine wood moistened with hydrochloric acid red.\r\n\r\n(3) It gave a red color with vanillin and hydrochloric acid, and\r\n\r\n(4) A deeper red color with oil of cloves and hydrochloric acid,\r\nbecoming purple on standing.\r\n\r\n(5) It gave a violet color with ferric chloride.\r\n\r\nThe substance is then, without doubt, fisetin. The formula[26] of\r\nfisetin is supposed to be C_{15}H_{10}O_{6}.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHAMNOSE.\r\n\r\nIt was stated above that Schmid obtained a sugar solution by the\r\ndecomposition of a fisetin-glucoside from _Rhus cotinus_, and Perkin\r\nobtained the same from a glucoside in _Rhus rhodanthema_. These\r\ninvestigators thought that the sugar was isodulcite or rhamnose, but\r\nthey did not isolate it on account of the small quantities of material\r\nat their disposal. Moreover, the sugar is very hard to crystallize in\r\nthe presence of other soluble substances and is not found in large\r\nquantity in plants. Maquenne[27] could obtain only 15 to 20 gm. of\r\nrhamnose by working up 1 kilogram of the berries of _Rhamnus\r\ninfectorius_. Assuming that the free fisetin found in poison ivy leaves\r\nhad its origin in the decomposition of a fisetin-glucoside by natural\r\nprocesses, it was reasonable to suppose that the sugar would also be\r\nfound in the free state, although, according to Roscoe and\r\nSchorlemmer:[28] \"Isodulcite does not occur in the free state in nature,\r\nbut is found as a peculiar ethereal salt belonging to the class of\r\nglucosides. On boiling with dilute sulphuric acid, this splits up into\r\nisodulcite and other bodies....\" The more recent works on the sugars and\r\non plant chemistry[29] mention the occurrence of rhamnose only in the\r\nglucoside form, with one possible exception. The exception referred to\r\nis the occurrence of a free sugar, supposed to be rhamnose, in a certain\r\npalm-wine.[30] Czapek says:[31] \"The well-known methyl pentoses do not\r\noccur in the free state in plant organisms so far as we know.\"\r\n\r\nSince rhamnose forms a lead compound, the sugar, if present, should be\r\nfound in the first lead precipitate, A, and also in filtrate A in case\r\nit is not completely precipitated in the presence of acetic acid and\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate A (about two liters) was examined first. It had a light\r\nyellow color, contained an excess of lead acetate, and was acid from the\r\nacetic acid liberated in the precipitation of the lead compound A.[32]\r\nThis filtrate was evaporated to dryness under diminished pressure to\r\nremove alcohol, water, and acetic acid. The clear distillate had a\r\npeculiar odor suggesting both tea and amyl formate. It was saved for\r\nexamination and was found to be not poisonous. The residue in the dish\r\nafter evaporation was a tough reddish brown, gummy mass which could be\r\ndrawn out into fine threads. It had a pleasant sweet odor. It was\r\nextracted several times with hot water, each portion being filtered. A\r\nbrownish yellow powder remained undissolved and was saved. The combined\r\nfiltrates deposited more of the yellow solid on standing. This powder\r\nwill be referred to later as \"P.\" The filtered liquid was freed from\r\nlead by hydrogen sulphide. The solution then had a lemon yellow color, a\r\nsweet odor and was acid from acetic acid. On concentrating the solution\r\nby evaporation and making a small portion of it alkaline with sodium\r\nhydroxide, the yellow color came out very intense[33]. The alkaline\r\nsolution reduced Fehling solution and ammoniacal silver nitrate,\r\nindicating the presence of a sugar. Another portion of the solution gave\r\na slight precipitate with phenyl hydrazine in the cold. The remainder of\r\nthe solution was evaporated to dryness, extracted with water, filtered,\r\nand again evaporated. A dark sticky syrup was left which was only partly\r\nsoluble in water. This was treated with water, filtered, and the\r\nfiltrate was evaporated, the water being replaced from time to time to\r\nremove acetic acid. Finally the liquid gave the following tests for\r\nrhamnose, besides those already mentioned:\r\n\r\n(1) With alpha-naphthol[34] and sulphuric acid, a purple violet\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n(2) With thymol[35] and sulphuric acid, a red color.\r\n\r\n(3) With resorcinol[36] and sulphuric acid, red color.\r\n\r\n(4) With orcinol[37] and hydrochloric acid, red color.\r\n\r\n(5) With ammonium picrate and sodium picrate, yellowish red color.\r\n\r\n(6) With phloroglucinol and hydrochloric acid, red color.\r\n\r\n(7) It decolorized an alkaline solution of potassium ferricyanide.\r\n\r\n(8) It gave a white precipitate with lead acetate.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate B (p. 20) from which gallic acid was precipitated by\r\nsulphuric acid in four fractions was saved to examine for sugar. To\r\nremove gallic acid completely, and other vegetable matter, it was shaken\r\nout several times with ether, and was kept at a low temperature with\r\nsalt and ice for a long time. It was left standing for several weeks,\r\nduring which time more brown matter separated out and was filtered off.\r\nThe filtrate was evaporated to a small bulk, cooled, and filtered from\r\ncrystals of potassium sulphate. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness,\r\nthe residue taken up in water and filtered through bone-black. Addition\r\nof alcohol caused complete precipitation of potassium sulphate. The\r\nsolution then gave the above mentioned characteristic tests for\r\nrhamnose.\r\n\r\nAll attempts to get the osazone of the sugar by the method of\r\nFischer[38] failed, probably on account of the small quantity of the\r\nsugar present. The plant, it will be remembered, was originally\r\nextracted with ether in which rhamnose is practically insoluble. The\r\nabove described tests, however, can leave no doubt as to the identity of\r\nthe sugar.\r\n\r\nAdditional evidence that the sugar is rhamnose was obtained by a method\r\ndescribed by Maquenne[39] as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The production of methyl furfurol in the dehydration of\r\n     isodulcite furnishes a very simple means of characterizing\r\n     this sugar in mixtures which contain it; it is sufficient,\r\n     for example, to distil 50 gm. of quercitron wood with as\r\n     much sulphuric acid and about 150 gm. of water, then to\r\n     rectify the liquid obtained in order to get several drops of\r\n     the crude furfurol, which on addition of alcohol and\r\n     concentrated sulphuric acid gives immediately the green\r\n     coloration characteristic of methyl furfurol. This procedure\r\n     is applicable to extracts as well as to entire plants, and\r\n     has the advantage that it does not require the separation of\r\n     isodulcite, the crystallization of which is often very slow\r\n     and at times impossible when it is mixed with other very\r\n     soluble substances.\"\r\n\r\nThe experiment was tried with the crude ether extract of the plant\r\naccording to the directions of Maquenne, and the green color with\r\nalcohol and sulphuric acid was obtained from the thicker oily portion of\r\nthe distillate. This test can be made with hydrochloric acid[40] as well\r\nas with sulphuric. Therefore the color test was tried with the ester\r\nmixture prepared in one of the early experiments by boiling the original\r\nplant material with hydrochloric acid and alcohol. Methyl furfurol was\r\nfound here also, this method indeed giving better results than that of\r\nMaquenne.\r\n\r\nThe presence of free rhamnose has thus been shown in the original\r\nmaterial, in the first precipitate by lead acetate, and in the filtrate\r\nfrom this precipitate. Experiments to be described under \"The Poison\"\r\nshowed that the ether extract from the Soxhlet apparatus contained a\r\nsubstance which yielded rhamnose when hydrolyzed by dilute sulphuric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nThe presence of free gallic acid, fisetin, and rhamnose in the plant can\r\nbe readily explained by a series of assumptions for which there is a\r\nconsiderable amount of experimental evidence. There is reason to believe\r\nthat tannin-like bodies are formed at the expense of chlorophyll,[41]\r\nthat complex tannin bodies can be broken down by acetic acid (also found\r\nin _Rhus toxicodendron_) into a tannic acid and a glucoside (for\r\nexample, the \"fustin-tannide\" mentioned above yields tannic acid and\r\nfisetin-glucoside); and finally that the glucoside can be hydrolyzed by\r\nacids or enzymes giving, in the sumach plants, fisetin and rhamnose.\r\n\r\nNitrogenous ferments which can effect the hydrolysis of glucosides and\r\ngive rise to sugars are frequently found in plants, for example, emulsin\r\nin almonds, myrosin in mustard, and erythrozym in madder. Acree and\r\nHinkins[42] found that diastase, pancreatin, and a number of other\r\nenzymes cause hydrolysis of triacetyl glucose with the formation of\r\nglucose and acetic acid. Stevens[43] obtained a nitrogenous oxidizing\r\nenzyme from _Rhus vernicifera_. The close relationship between the\r\npoisonous species of _Rhus_ would lead us to suppose that the same\r\nsoluble ferment exists in poison ivy, though it was not detected in the\r\noriginal material used in these experiments, probably because the plant\r\nwas extracted with ether in which the enzyme is insoluble. The existence\r\nof such a soluble ferment would explain the presence of free sugar and\r\nfree fisetin.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF THE PRESENCE OF A FATTY ACID IN FILTRATE A.\r\n\r\nThe brown substance P, obtained from filtrate A by evaporation and\r\nextracting the residue with hot water, was suspended in warm water and\r\ndilute sulphuric was added. A white precipitate was formed and a strong\r\nfatty acid odor was developed. After the mixture had been heated for\r\nsome hours on the water bath a small portion was made alkaline and it\r\nreduced Fehling solution. The main solution was filtered and the\r\nprecipitate supposed to be a fatty acid was saved. The filtrate was\r\nneutralized with barium carbonate, filtered, evaporated, freed from\r\ncaramel, and the solution then gave the tests mentioned above for\r\nrhamnose.\r\n\r\nA portion of the precipitate supposed to be a fatty acid was ignited in\r\na porcelain spoon. It fused, carbonized, and burned. The remainder was\r\nheated with alcoholic potash and reprecipitated with hydrochloric acid.\r\nThe precipitate was washed and heated with alcohol. Part of it\r\ndissolved. The insoluble part was found to be a lead compound. On\r\nboiling it with hydrochloric acid and cooling, lead chloride\r\ncrystallized out. This was confirmed by dissolving the lead chloride in\r\nhot water and precipitating as lead sulphide. These experiments were not\r\ncarried farther on account of the small quantity of material, but they\r\nshow that the gummy substance obtained from filtrate A contained\r\nrhamnose (either as a lead compound of free sugar or as a lead compound\r\nof a rhamnoside), and also, most probably, the lead compound of an\r\norganic acid.[44]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRAGRANT DISTILLATE.\r\n\r\nSeveral times in the course of this work, extracts of the original plant\r\nmaterial in alcohol and in water were distilled under diminished\r\npressure for the purpose of concentrating the solutions. The distillate,\r\nin every case, had an ethereal odor suggesting amyl formate in very\r\ndilute solution, but was more fragrant. The distillate from a water\r\nextract was examined. It was a clear liquid, a little darker than pure\r\nwater, was not poisonous, was neutral to litmus paper, gave no color\r\nwith ferric chloride, reduced ammoniacal silver nitrate, but not Fehling\r\nsolution, and gave a faint red color with dilute ammonium hydroxide and\r\nwith sodium carbonate.\r\n\r\nA small quantity of a finely divided black precipitate separated out\r\nfrom the water distillate on standing.\r\n\r\nThe substance with the fragrant odor was extracted by shaking the\r\ndistillate with ether and letting the ether evaporate spontaneously. A\r\nvery small quantity of a yellow solid was deposited on the sides of the\r\ndish. This substance had a strong and persistent odor, so sweet as to be\r\nalmost nauseating. Not enough was obtained for examination or analysis.\r\nThis fragrant residue was difficultly soluble in water and the solution\r\nreduced silver nitrate in ammonia. A steam distillate of the original\r\nplant material had the same fragrant odor as the distillate from a water\r\nextract.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POISON.\r\n\r\n288 grams of the original poisonous material were extracted with 50 per\r\ncent. alcohol, and this alcoholic solution was precipitated with lead\r\nacetate in the manner already described (p. 17). The lead precipitate so\r\nobtained was extracted with ether in Soxhlet extractors and after the\r\nextraction was found by test to be free from poison. Therefore the\r\npoison, if precipitated by the lead acetate, must have been extracted by\r\nthe ether. This ether solution had a dark green color, and was acid from\r\nacetic acid brought down in the lead precipitate. The ether was\r\nevaporated in a vacuum desiccator without heat and there remained a\r\nsmall quantity of an acid mixture of water and a soft tar; the watery\r\npart was colored green, showing that the tar was soluble to some extent\r\nin dilute acetic acid. The mixture had the peculiar odor of the original\r\nmaterial. A small drop of the green watery part was applied to the\r\nwrist, allowed to remain a few minutes and was then removed by absorbent\r\npaper, but the spot was not washed. Itching and reddening of the skin\r\ncommenced within twenty-four hours. At the end of forty-eight hours,\r\nthere was a well developed case of poisoning. How this was cured will be\r\ndescribed in another place.\r\n\r\nA small portion of the poisonous mixture was dissolved in alcohol, and\r\nthis solution was divided into three parts. The first part was treated\r\nwith ferric chloride, but it gave no color reaction. Another portion of\r\nthe alcoholic solution was diluted with water. It became turbid. The\r\nthird portion gave a dirty-green precipitate with lead acetate, which\r\nseemed to come down more readily when the solution was diluted with\r\nwater. The main portion of the poisonous mixture was then dissolved in\r\n95 per cent. alcohol and lead acetate in 50 per cent. alcohol was added.\r\nThe precipitate was filtered, washed, and decomposed by hydrogen\r\nsulphide in a mixture of water and ether. The ether solution was\r\nfiltered and evaporated. The residue was a tar which, on standing in a\r\ndesiccator for some time, became dry enough to break into sticky lumps.\r\nAn alcoholic solution of this substance gave a dark color with ferric\r\nchloride and a light colored precipitate with lead acetate.\r\n\r\nTo get more of the poisonous tar for study, 233 grams of original\r\nmaterial were extracted with 95 per cent. alcohol. Strong alcohol was\r\nused in order to dissolve as much of the tar as possible. The solution\r\nhad a dark greenish color, but was somewhat yellow in thin layers. The\r\nundissolved tar was filtered off and extracted twice again in the same\r\nway. The tar left after the third extraction was only slightly soluble\r\nin alcohol, and its solution was not poisonous. The three filtrates from\r\nthese three extractions were precipitated separately by lead acetate in\r\n50 per cent. alcohol. The first precipitate was largest, darkest in\r\ncolor, and carried down more tarry matter. The second was light green,\r\nand the third was quite small, black, and was not a lead compound at\r\nall, but some of the tar which separated out on diluting the strong\r\nalcohol with the weaker grade containing lead acetate. It was soluble in\r\nether and less soluble in alcohol. The alcoholic solution of this third\r\nlot gave no precipitate with hydrogen sulphide. The first and second\r\nlead precipitates were filtered by suction and washed with water. They\r\nwere kept a day or two in a desiccator over sulphuric acid, but did not\r\nbecome completely dry. The weight of these two moist precipitates\r\ntogether was 172 grams. They were combined and extracted with ether in\r\nSoxhlet extractors which were kept in operation during work hours for\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the alcoholic filtrates from these lead precipitates\r\nwere combined and concentrated on the water bath by distilling off two\r\nliters of alcohol. The alcohol obtained had the peculiar odor of the\r\noriginal material, but was not poisonous.\r\n\r\nAfter a long extraction of the lead precipitate in the Soxhlet\r\nextractors, the green ether solutions were combined and washed by\r\nshaking them with water to remove lead acetate and acetic acid in case\r\nany should have been held in the lead precipitate. The ether was\r\ndistilled off at a low temperature and there remained a soft tar, a\r\nportion of which was not completely soluble in 95 per cent. alcohol. The\r\nalcoholic solution had a greenish yellow color and was poisonous. The\r\ntar was also partly soluble in acetic acid, and this solution was found\r\nto contain lead. Thinking that the lead acetate had not been completely\r\nwashed out, the main part of the tar was dissolved in ether and shaken\r\nwith water. The wash water continued to give a test for lead as long as\r\nthe washing was continued. This indicated probably the hydrolysis of an\r\nunstable lead compound. Hydrogen sulphide was passed into the ether\r\nsolution mixed with water to remove the lead. Lead sulphide was filtered\r\noff, and the ether was evaporated. A small portion of the tar residue in\r\nalcoholic solution gave a color reaction with ferric chloride. As this\r\nmay have been due to traces of lead gallate dissolved in the extraction\r\nwith ether and afterwards decomposed by hydrogen sulphide, the main\r\nportion of the tar was redissolved in ether and shaken with water until\r\nit no longer reacted with ferric chloride. The ether was then evaporated\r\nand a soft, black, poisonous tar or gum of uniform consistency was left\r\nwhich was shown by tests to be free from gallic acid and lead. These\r\nexperiments showed that some of the poison was precipitated as a lead\r\ncompound soluble in ether and some was brought down mechanically in the\r\nfree state. To see if the extraction with ether in the Soxhlet apparatus\r\nwas complete, the residue in the thimbles was decomposed by hydrogen\r\nsulphide and shaken with ether. The dark colored ether solution was\r\nfreed from gallic acid by shaking with water and dilute sodium carbonate\r\nsolution, and was evaporated. A small quantity of tar was obtained which\r\nwas added to the main portion.\r\n\r\nA solution of the poisonous tar in 95 per cent. alcohol did not reduce\r\nFehling solution and did not give a precipitate with lead acetate except\r\nthe separation of a small quantity of tar, which was not a lead\r\ncompound. The lead compound of the poison was apparently soluble in 95\r\nper cent. alcohol as well as in ether, for it would not precipitate in\r\nthis medium, although it was found in the original precipitate by lead\r\nacetate. The alcoholic solution of the tar became turbid on diluting\r\nwith water.\r\n\r\nIn order to see if the poison is volatile with vapor of acetic acid,\r\nsince this acid is found in the plant and it is thought by some that the\r\npoison is volatile, a portion of the tar was distilled under diminished\r\npressure with acetic acid. It was soluble to some extent in the acid.\r\nThe temperature did not go higher than 55 deg. during the distillation. A\r\ntube containing cotton wet with sweet oil was placed between the\r\nreceiver and the water suction so that the uncondensed vapors would have\r\nto pass through the cotton. This cotton was rubbed on the skin and was\r\nnot poisonous. The yellow distillate collected in the receiver was also\r\ntested and was not poisonous.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROLYSIS OF THE POISON.\r\n\r\nAbout 5 grams of the poisonous tar free from gallic acid and sugar was\r\ndissolved in alcohol, and dilute (2 per cent.) sulphuric acid was added.\r\nSome of the tar separated out on diluting the alcohol with the acid. The\r\nmixture was heated on a water bath during work hours for four days. A\r\npurple and green fluorescent solution was formed, though much tar was\r\nleft apparently unchanged. The alcohol was evaporated off and the\r\nsolution was filtered from tar. The fluorescent filtrate was shaken\r\nwith ether, by which the green substance was removed, leaving the\r\nsolution purple. The ether left, on evaporation, a small quantity of a\r\ngreen substance having a pleasant ester odor. It was not further\r\nexamined. A portion of the purple solution was exactly neutralized with\r\nsodium carbonate. This solution gave a blue-black color with ferric\r\nchloride which became red on addition of another drop of sodium\r\ncarbonate, indicating gallic acid. It also reduced Fehling solution.\r\n\r\nAnother portion of the purple solution was made alkaline with sodium\r\ncarbonate. A reddish-brown flocculent precipitate was formed and was\r\nfiltered off. The filtrate did not give any color with ferric chloride,\r\nbut it reduced Fehling solution. It also gave the test for rhamnose with\r\nalpha-naphthol.\r\n\r\nThe main portion of the purple solution was made alkaline with sodium\r\ncarbonate; the precipitate was filtered off and dissolved in acetic\r\nacid. This solution was yellow and gave a reaction with ferric chloride\r\nsimilar to that of gallic acid. The filtrate from the precipitate by\r\nsodium carbonate was concentrated by evaporation until sodium sulphate\r\nbegan to crystallize out. Alcohol was added to precipitate the sodium\r\nsulphate completely, the mixture was heated and filtered. The alcoholic\r\nfiltrate was concentrated to a syrup which reduced Fehling solution and\r\ngave the characteristic tests for rhamnose already described. By this\r\nhydrolysis, the tar was split up into rhamnose and some form of gallic\r\nacid which could be precipitated by sodium carbonate. This compound,\r\nwhose acetic acid solution was yellow, probably contained fisetin also.\r\nThe reason for this last statement will appear from the following\r\nexperiment:\r\n\r\n\r\nDECOMPOSITION OF THE POISON WITH ACETIC ACID.\r\n\r\nA portion of the poisonous tar was heated in an open dish with strong\r\nacetic acid. The tar seemed to be decomposed to some extent, giving a\r\nyellow substance. Acetic acid was added from time to time as it\r\nevaporated. After several evaporations, water was added, the mixture was\r\nheated to boiling and filtered. This filtrate No. 1 will be mentioned\r\nlater. The residue in the dish consisted of undecomposed tar and an\r\nolive-green flaky substance. This substance was heated with a fresh\r\nportion of glacial acetic acid. Water was added, and the mixture was\r\nboiled and filtered. The filtrate had a deep yellow color suggesting\r\nfisetin. It was shaken out with ethyl acetate which became colored\r\nyellow. A portion of the ethyl acetate solution gave an orange red\r\nprecipitate with lead acetate showing the presence of fisetin. The ethyl\r\nacetate was removed from the remainder of the solution by evaporation\r\nand the yellow residue was taken up in alcohol. This alcoholic solution\r\ngave the characteristic reactions for fisetin with stannous chloride,\r\nwith potassium hydroxide, with ferric chloride and with Fehling\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nFiltrate No. 1 obtained by heating the poisonous tar with acetic acid\r\nand hot water as described above was investigated as follows: A portion\r\nof it gave a reddish colored precipitate with sodium carbonate as in the\r\ncase when the tar was hydrolyzed with sulphuric acid. The remainder was\r\nnearly neutralized with sodium carbonate and lead acetate was added in\r\nexcess to remove gallic acid. The excess of lead was removed by\r\nsulphuric acid, and the sulphuric acid was removed by barium carbonate.\r\nThe solution on evaporation reduced Fehling solution to some extent, but\r\na white precipitate was also formed.\r\n\r\nIn this experiment, gallic acid and fisetin and probably sugar were\r\nformed by decomposition of the poisonous gum with acetic acid, the acid\r\nfound in the plant by Pfaff. The presence of free gallic acid, fisetin\r\nand rhamnose in the plant can therefore be explained by the natural\r\nhydrolysis of a complex gum or tar or a constituent thereof. The\r\npoisonous property is lost in the general rearrangement which takes\r\nplace during hydrolysis.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous tar was not hydrolyzed by boiling with a dilute solution\r\nof sodium carbonate.\r\n\r\nIt was found, as has been stated elsewhere, that the lead compound of\r\nthe poison could not be precipitated in 95 per cent. alcohol. Further\r\nexperiments, however, showed that on extracting the poisonous gum with\r\n50 per cent. alcohol, a portion of it dissolved, and this solution gave\r\na precipitate with lead acetate which was a true lead compound. The\r\nremainder of the purified tar (about 10 gm.) was treated with 50 per\r\ncent. alcohol and filtered. Very little dissolved in alcohol of this\r\nstrength, but on addition of lead acetate in 50 per cent. alcohol to the\r\nsolution, a light colored precipitate was formed, which became dark on\r\nstanding. It was filtered off, washed free from lead acetate, decomposed\r\nby hydrogen sulphide, and shaken out with ether. The ether left, on\r\nevaporation, a yellow resinous substance having a faint odor like\r\ngarlic. By drying in a desiccator, a small quantity of a solid yellow\r\nresin was obtained which was completely soluble in alcohol. A very small\r\ndrop of this solution applied to the skin on the end of a glass rod\r\nwhich had been drawn out to a point caused an eruption in about\r\nthirty-six hours. Following the nomenclature used by Maisch and Pfaff,\r\nthis substance will be designated as _Toxicodendrin_, the ending \"in\"\r\nindicating its glucoside nature.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate from the lead precipitate just described was freed from the\r\nexcess of lead acetate by hydrogen sulphide, was tested for poison, and\r\nwas found to be poisonous, showing that the precipitation by lead\r\nacetate was not complete even in 50 per cent. alcohol. On spontaneous\r\nevaporation of the solution, a yellow, sweet smelling resin was left.\r\n\r\nA portion of the alcoholic solution of the toxicodendrin gave a dark\r\ncoloration with ferric chloride, did not reduce Fehling solution and was\r\nslightly acid to litmus.\r\n\r\nTo see whether the toxicodendrin could be hydrolyzed, the remainder was\r\ndissolved in alcohol and dilute sulphuric acid was added. A fine, white\r\nprecipitate was formed at once which rose to the surface on standing as\r\na light flocculent substance. The mixture was heated for several days on\r\na water bath, filtered from unhydrolyzed resin and the filtrate was\r\nneutralized and concentrated in the way already described. The solution\r\nobtained reduced Fehling solution. Not enough was obtained for further\r\nsugar tests, but all the hydrolysis experiments point to the conclusion\r\nthat the poisonous substance is a rhamnoside, and is the source of the\r\nsugar in the plant.\r\n\r\nThe reaction with ferric chloride observed whenever a lead compound of\r\nthe poison is decomposed by hydrogen sulphide may be explained by the\r\nformation of traces of gallic acid or fisetin through the action of the\r\nweak acids present.\r\n\r\nThe supply of purified poisonous tar having been exhausted in the\r\npreceding experiments, further study of the active principle is\r\npostponed until more can be prepared. It is highly desirable to\r\ninvestigate the white precipitate formed by addition of sulphuric acid\r\nto an alcoholic solution of the toxicodendrin.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXIDATION OF THE PURIFIED TAR WITH NITRIC ACID.\r\n\r\nWhen the purified poisonous material (p. 32) was extracted with 50 per\r\ncent. alcohol, only a small quantity was dissolved as was stated above.\r\nThe insoluble residue was treated with fuming nitric acid. Violent\r\nreaction took place at once with copious evolution of red fumes and\r\nheat. When the reaction was over, a sticky red gummy mass was left which\r\nwas slightly soluble in cold water and readily soluble in warm alcohol.\r\nThe water extract was yellow, and the alcoholic solution was red. That\r\nthe water extract contained picric acid was shown by the following\r\nexperiments:\r\n\r\n     (1) A portion was gently warmed with a few drops of a strong\r\n     solution of potassium cyanide and two drops of sodium\r\n     hydroxide. The red color of potassium isopurpurate was\r\n     formed.\r\n\r\n     (2) A portion of the water solution was heated with glucose\r\n     and a few drops of sodium hydroxide. The deep red color of\r\n     picraminic acid was produced.\r\n\r\n     (3) A few drops of an ammoniacal solution of copper sulphate\r\n     was added to the water extract. A yellow-green precipitate\r\n     was formed.\r\n\r\n     (4) The water extract dyed silk, but did not dye cotton\r\n     cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTILLATION OF THE TAR WITH SODA LIME.\r\n\r\nAbout 25 gm. of the tar left after extracting the original material with\r\nhot water was dissolved in ether and poured into a glass retort\r\ncontaining soda lime. The ether was distilled out, leaving the tar\r\nintimately mixed with the soda lime. The retort was then gradually\r\nheated. Vapors and liquid were given off, both of which turned red\r\nlitmus blue and had a strong odor like tobacco smoke. No odor of ammonia\r\nwas detected.[45] At the high temperature of the triple burner, a\r\nsemi-solid, red, greasy substance collected in and closed the condenser\r\ntube. This substance had the same powerful odor as the liquid portion of\r\nthe distillate. The clear, watery portion of the distillate was\r\nseparated from the thicker parts, and was found to contain pyrrol and\r\npyridine derivatives by the following characteristic tests:\r\n\r\n     (1) Wood moistened with hydrochloric acid was turned red by\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     (2) Colorless fumes were formed when brought near\r\n     hydrochloric acid; mixed with hydrochloric acid, a red\r\n     insoluble substance was formed.\r\n\r\n     (3) It precipitated the hydroxides of iron, gave a light\r\n     blue precipitate with copper sulphate, and a white\r\n     precipitate with mercuric chloride.\r\n\r\nThe greasy, semi-solid mass was extracted with 10 per cent. hydrochloric\r\nacid and filtered. On addition of a solution of mercuric chloride to the\r\nred filtrate, a brown flocculent precipitate was formed. It was filtered\r\noff and distilled with caustic soda, but the distillate did not contain\r\npyridine.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASSIUM PERMANGANATE AS A REMEDY FOR RHUS POISONING.[46]\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of this work some experiments were made to see if\r\npotassium permanganate could be used to purify the lead precipitate by\r\noxidizing the tar brought down in precipitation. It was found that the\r\npermanganate attacked the lead precipitate as well as the other organic\r\nmatter in the vessel. This fact and the well-known value of permanganate\r\nin treating skin diseases, its use as an antidote for some kinds of\r\nalkaloid poisoning,[47] as an antidote given to cattle poisoned by\r\nplants,[48] and as an antidote for snake bites,[49] suggested its use as\r\na remedy for Rhus poisoning. Maisch[50] mentioned that he had used it\r\nwith success, but it never came into general use, probably on account of\r\nits staining the skin and clothing. In carrying out this work abundant\r\nopportunities for testing its value as a remedy for the dermatitis\r\ncaused by poison ivy were afforded by many cases of accidental and\r\nintentional poisoning. The best example of the latter was obtained with\r\nthe ether solution from the extraction of the lead precipitate in the\r\nSoxhlet apparatus (page 28). After removing the ether, a small drop of\r\nthe residue was applied to the wrist as described. An itching red spot\r\nabout the size of a dime was noticed in thirty-six hours, and it\r\nsteadily increased in size. Nearly two days after the application of the\r\npoison, a dilute solution of potassium permanganate containing a little\r\ncaustic potash was rubbed into the spot until the pimples were\r\ndestroyed. A little black spot was left wherever there had been a\r\npimple, showing that the permanganate had been reduced to oxide in the\r\nskin. The place was washed and nothing more was thought of it until the\r\nmorning following, when it was noticed that the wrist had commenced to\r\nswell during the night, and the characteristic watery secretion was\r\nrunning from the poisoned spot. More permanganate solution was applied\r\nwithout potash and the wrist was bandaged, thinking that this would\r\nprevent the spreading of the eruption, but it really facilitated\r\nspreading by becoming saturated with the poisonous fluid and keeping it\r\nin contact with a larger surface of skin. In the meantime the swelling\r\nand inflammation had extended nearly to the elbow. The arm now had the\r\nappearance of having been bitten by a snake. To reduce the swelling it\r\nwas immersed in hot water. This seemed to bring out the eruption very\r\nquickly and the blisters were treated with permanganate as fast as they\r\nappeared. The swelling was reduced, but returned during the night. On\r\nthe evening following, the forearm was immersed in a bowl of hot\r\npermanganate solution containing a little caustic potash. The solution\r\nwas kept as hot as could be borne for about half an hour. After this\r\nbath, the poison was completely oxidized, for the swelling was reduced\r\nand did not return, nor was there any fresh eruption. What appeared to\r\nbe a severe case of poisoning was thus cured very quickly. The use of\r\nhot water not only reduces the swelling, but also helps to destroy the\r\npoison. The action of permanganate is also more rapid at high\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\nThe oxidizing power of permanganate, as is well known, is greater in\r\nacid solution than in alkaline, five atoms of oxygen being available in\r\nthe former and three in the latter, according to these equations:\r\n\r\n    2 KMnO_{4} + 3 H_{2}SO_{4} = K_{2}SO_{4} + 2 MnSO_{4} + 3 H_{2}O + 5 O.\r\n    2 KMnO_{4} + H_{2}O = 2 MnO_{2} + 2 KOH + 3 O.\r\n\r\nPermanganate was used as a remedy in some cases mixed with dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, and in others, with zinc sulphate; also with lime water.\r\nIt was found to be satisfactory whether used alone or with any of the\r\nsubstances mentioned, provided it was well rubbed into the skin. The\r\nconcentration of the solution used was varied according to the location\r\nand condition of the eruption. Where the skin was thin or already\r\nbroken, dilute solutions (one per cent.) were used. In one case, the\r\neruption appeared in the palm of the hand where the skin was so thick\r\nthat it was necessary to open it before the remedies could reach the\r\npoison. The difficulty of getting the remedy in contact with the poison\r\nin the skin is the reason why the eruption is hard to cure.\r\n\r\nThe remedy most commonly used for this eruption is an alcoholic solution\r\nof lead acetate. This remedy is unsatisfactory for the reason that its\r\naction consists in depositing an unstable lead compound of the poison in\r\nthe skin where the conditions of moisture and temperature are favorable\r\nfor its decomposition, liberating the poison with all its irritant\r\nproperties. Moreover, alcoholic preparations should not be used because\r\nthe alcohol dissolves the poison and, on evaporation, leaves it spread\r\nover a larger surface like a varnish. Potassium permanganate, however,\r\noxidizes the poison completely. The only objection to the use of\r\npermanganate of which the writer is aware is that it stains the skin.\r\nThe stain can be removed by vigorous scrubbing with soap, or it will\r\nwear off gradually in a few days. It can be removed at once by certain\r\nacids, but these should not be used by persons not familiar with their\r\naction.\r\n\r\nWith the knowledge of the facts mentioned, many solutions were tested\r\nfor poison by applying them to the skin, and when an eruption appeared,\r\nit was cured quickly and permanently by rubbing in a permanganate\r\nsolution, usually mixed with dilute sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] Nitrogen was found very readily by the soda lime test in the tar\r\nleft after extracting the original material with 50 per cent. alcohol,\r\nbut was not found by the Lassaign test.\r\n\r\n[17] Stevens.

In the residue, the following\r\nsubstances were found and studied: gallic acid, fisetin, the sugar\r\nrhamnose, and a poisonous tar, gum, or wax.\r\n\r\nThe lead compound of the poison was soluble in ether; this fact gave a\r\nmeans of separating the poisonous substance from the non-poisonous\r\nmatter in one operation.\r\n\r\nThe poison was not volatile with vapor of acetic acid, or with vapor of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous tar or wax was decomposed by acids and yielded gallic\r\nacid, fisetin, and rhamnose, showing the probable source of these\r\ncompounds in the plant, and indicating that the poison is a complex\r\nsubstance of a glucoside nature.\r\n\r\nIt was found that a portion of the poisonous substance could be\r\nprecipitated by lead acetate from a solution of the purified tar in 50\r\nper cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nAll cases of poisoning developed on the writer were easily cured with\r\npotassium permanganate.\r\n\r\nThe following method is suggested for obtaining the poisonous substance\r\nfrom the plant: Extract the plant with alcohol, filter, and precipitate\r\nat once with lead acetate. Wash the precipitate, dry, and extract with\r\nether in Soxhlet extractors (loosely filled). Combine the ether\r\nextracts, mix with water, and pass in hydrogen sulphide. Separate the\r\nwater and the ether solution, and filter the latter. Wash the ether\r\nsolution thoroughly by shaking with water, and then evaporate at a low\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Anderson Syme, the author of this dissertation, was born in\r\nRaleigh, N.
