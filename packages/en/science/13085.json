Transportation is Civilisation, our motto\r\nruns. Theoretically we do what we please, so long as we do not interfere\r\nwith the traffic_ and all it implies. _Practically, the A.B.C. confirms\r\nor annuls all international arrangements, and, to judge from its last\r\nreport, finds our tolerant, humorous, lazy little Planet only too ready\r\nto shift the whole burden of public administration on its shoulders_.\r\n\r\n'With the Night Mail[1].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Actions and Reactions_.]\r\n\r\nIsn't it almost time that our Planet took some interest in the\r\nproceedings of the Aërial Board of Control? One knows that easy\r\ncommunications nowadays, and lack of privacy in the past, have killed\r\nall curiosity among mankind, but as the Board's Official Reporter I am\r\nbound to tell my tale.\r\n\r\nAt 9.30 A.M., August 26, A.D. 2065, the Board, sitting in London, was\r\ninformed by De Forest that the District of Northern Illinois had\r\nriotously cut itself out of all systems and would remain disconnected\r\ntill the Board should take over and administer it direct.\r\n\r\nEvery Northern Illinois freight and passenger tower was, he reported,\r\nout of action; all District main, local, and guiding lights had been\r\nextinguished; all General Communications were dumb, and through traffic\r\nhad been diverted. No reason had been given, but he gathered\r\nunofficially from the Mayor of Chicago that the District complained of\r\n'crowd-making and invasion of privacy.'\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it is of no importance whether Northern Illinois\r\nstay in or out of planetary circuit; as a matter of policy, any\r\ncomplaint of invasion of privacy needs immediate investigation, lest\r\nworse follow.\r\n\r\nBy 9-45 A.M. De Forest, Dragomiroff (Russia), Takahira (Japan), and\r\nPirolo (Italy) were empowered to visit Illinois and 'to take such steps\r\nas might be necessary for the resumption of traffic and _all that that\r\nimplies.'_ By 10 A.M. the Hall was empty, and the four Members and I\r\nwere aboard what Pirolo insisted on calling 'my leetle godchild'--that\r\nis to say, the new _Victor Pirolo_. Our Planet prefers to know Victor\r\nPirolo as a gentle, grey-haired enthusiast who spends his time near\r\nFoggia, inventing or creating new breeds of Spanish-Italian olive-trees;\r\nbut there is another side to his nature--the manufacture of quaint\r\ninventions, of which the _Victor Pirolo_ is, perhaps, not the least\r\nsurprising. She and a few score sister-craft of the same type embody his\r\nlatest ideas. But she is not comfortable. An A.B.C. boat does not take\r\nthe air with the level-keeled lift of a liner, but shoots up\r\nrocket-fashion like the 'aeroplane' of our ancestors, and makes her\r\nheight at top-speed from the first. That is why I found myself sitting\r\nsuddenly on the large lap of Eustace Arnott, who commands the A.B.C.\r\nFleet. One knows vaguely that there is such a thing as a Fleet somewhere\r\non the Planet, and that, theoretically, it exists for the purposes of\r\nwhat used to be known as 'war.' Only a week before, while visiting a\r\nglacier sanatorium behind Gothaven, I had seen some squadrons making\r\nfalse auroras far to the north while they manoeuvred round the Pole;\r\nbut, naturally, it had never occurred to me that the things could be\r\nused in earnest.\r\n\r\nSaid Arnott to De Forest as I staggered to a seat on the chart-room\r\ndivan: 'We're tremendously grateful to 'em in Illinois. We've never had\r\na chance of exercising all the Fleet together. I've turned in a General\r\nCall, and I expect we'll have at least two hundred keels aloft\r\nthis evening.'\r\n\r\n'Well aloft?' De Forest asked.\r\n\r\n'Of course, sir. Out of sight till they're called for.'\r\n\r\nArnott laughed as he lolled over the transparent chart-table where the\r\nmap of the summer-blue Atlantic slid along, degree by degree, in exact\r\nanswer to our progress. Our dial already showed 320 m.p.h. and we were\r\ntwo thousand feet above the uppermost traffic lines.\r\n\r\n'Now, where is this Illinois District of yours?' said Dragomiroff. 'One\r\ntravels so much, one sees so little. Oh, I remember! It is in\r\nNorth America.'\r\n\r\nDe Forest, whose business it is to know the out districts, told us that\r\nit lay at the foot of Lake Michigan, on a road to nowhere in particular,\r\nwas about half an hour's run from end to end, and, except in one corner,\r\nas flat as the sea. Like most flat countries nowadays, it was heavily\r\nguarded against invasion of privacy by forced timber--fifty-foot spruce\r\nand tamarack, grown in five years. The population was close on two\r\nmillions, largely migratory between Florida and California, with a\r\nbackbone of small farms (they call a thousand acres a farm in Illinois)\r\nwhose owners come into Chicago for amusements and society during the\r\nwinter. They were, he said, noticeably kind, quiet folk, but a little\r\nexacting, as all flat countries must be, in their notions of privacy.\r\nThere had, for instance, been no printed news-sheet in Illinois for\r\ntwenty-seven years. Chicago argued that engines for printed news sooner\r\nor later developed into engines for invasion of privacy, which in turn\r\nmight bring the old terror of Crowds and blackmail back to the Planet.\r\nSo news-sheets were not.\r\n\r\n'And that's Illinois,' De Forest concluded. 'You see, in the Old Days,\r\nshe was in the forefront of what they used to call \"progress,\" and\r\nChicago--'\r\n\r\n'Chicago?' said Takahira. 'That's the little place where there is\r\nSalati's Statue of the Nigger in Flames? A fine bit of old work.'\r\n\r\n'When did you see it?' asked De Forest quickly. 'They only unveil it\r\nonce a year.'\r\n\r\n'I know. At Thanksgiving. It was then,' said Takahira, with a shudder.\r\n'And they sang MacDonough's Song, too.'\r\n\r\n'Whew!' De Forest whistled. 'I did not know that! I wish you'd told me\r\nbefore. MacDonough's Song may have had its uses when it was composed,\r\nbut it was an infernal legacy for any man to leave behind.'\r\n\r\n'It's protective instinct, my dear fellows,' said Pirolo, rolling a\r\ncigarette. 'The Planet, she has had her dose of popular government. She\r\nsuffers from inherited agoraphobia. She has no--ah--use for Crowds.'\r\n\r\nDragomiroff leaned forward to give him a light. 'Certainly,' said the\r\nwhite-bearded Russian, 'the Planet has taken all precautions against\r\nCrowds for the past hundred years. What is our total population to-day?\r\nSix hundred million, we hope; five hundred, we think; but--but if next\r\nyear's census shows more than four hundred and fifty, I myself will eat\r\nall the extra little babies. We have cut the birth-rate out--right out!\r\nFor a long time we have said to Almighty God, \"Thank You, Sir, but we do\r\nnot much like Your game of life, so we will not play.\"'\r\n\r\n'Anyhow,' said Arnott defiantly, 'men live a century apiece on the\r\naverage now.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, that is quite well! I am rich--you are rich--we are all rich and\r\nhappy because we are so few and we live so long. Only _I_ think Almighty\r\nGod He will remember what the Planet was like in the time of Crowds and\r\nthe Plague. Perhaps He will send us nerves. Eh, Pirolo?'\r\n\r\nThe Italian blinked into space. 'Perhaps,' he said, 'He has sent them\r\nalready. Anyhow, you cannot argue with the Planet. She does not forget\r\nthe Old Days, and--what can you do?'\r\n\r\n'For sure we can't remake the world.' De Forest glanced at the map\r\nflowing smoothly across the table from west to east. 'We ought to be\r\nover our ground by nine to-night. There won't be much sleep afterwards.'\r\n\r\nOn which hint we dispersed, and I slept till Takahira waked me for\r\ndinner. Our ancestors thought nine hours' sleep ample for their little\r\nlives. We, living thirty years longer, feel ourselves defrauded with\r\nless than eleven out of the twenty-four.\r\n\r\nBy ten o'clock we were over Lake Michigan. The west shore was lightless,\r\nexcept for a dull ground-glare at Chicago, and a single\r\ntraffic-directing light--its leading beam pointing north--at Waukegan on\r\nour starboard bow. None of the Lake villages gave any sign of life; and\r\ninland, westward, so far as we could see, blackness lay unbroken on the\r\nlevel earth. We swooped down and skimmed low across the dark, throwing\r\ncalls county by county. Now and again we picked up the faint glimmer of\r\na house-light, or heard the rasp and rend of a cultivator being played\r\nacross the fields, but Northern Illinois as a whole was one inky,\r\napparently uninhabited, waste of high, forced woods. Only our\r\nilluminated map, with its little pointer switching from county to county\r\nas we wheeled and twisted, gave us any idea of our position. Our calls,\r\nurgent, pleading, coaxing or commanding, through the General\r\nCommunicator brought no answer. Illinois strictly maintained her own\r\nprivacy in the timber which she grew for that purpose.\r\n\r\n'Oh, this is absurd!' said De Forest. 'We're like an owl trying to work\r\na wheat-field. Is this Bureau Creek? Let's land, Arnott, and get hold of\r\nsome one.'\r\n\r\nWe brushed over a belt of forced woodland--fifteen-year-old maple sixty\r\nfeet high--grounded on a private meadow-dock, none too big, where we\r\nmoored to our own grapnels, and hurried out through the warm dark night\r\ntowards a light in a verandah. As we neared the garden gate I could have\r\nsworn we had stepped knee-deep in quicksand, for we could scarcely drag\r\nour feet against the prickling currents that clogged them. After five\r\npaces we stopped, wiping our foreheads, as hopelessly stuck on dry\r\nsmooth turf as so many cows in a bog.\r\n\r\n'Pest!' cried Pirolo angrily. 'We are ground-circuited. And it is my own\r\nsystem of ground-circuits too! I know the pull.'\r\n\r\n'Good evening,' said a girl's voice from the verandah. 'Oh, I'm sorry!\r\nWe've locked up. Wait a minute.'\r\n\r\nWe heard the click of a switch, and almost fell forward as the currents\r\nround our knees were withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed, and laid aside her knitting. An old-fashioned\r\nController stood at her elbow, which she reversed from time to time, and\r\nwe could hear the snort and clank of the obedient cultivator half a mile\r\naway, behind the guardian woods.\r\n\r\n'Come in and sit down,' she said. 'I'm only playing a plough. Dad's\r\ngone to Chicago to--Ah! Then it was _your_ call I heard just now!'\r\n\r\nShe had caught sight of Arnott's Board uniform, leaped to the switch,\r\nand turned it full on.\r\n\r\nWe were checked, gasping, waist-deep in current this time, three yards\r\nfrom the verandah.\r\n\r\n'We only want to know what's the matter with Illinois,' said De Forest\r\nplacidly.\r\n\r\n'Then hadn't you better go to Chicago and find out?' she answered.\r\n'There's nothing wrong here. We own ourselves.'\r\n\r\n'How can we go anywhere if you won't loose us?' De Forest went on, while\r\nArnott scowled. Admirals of Fleets are still quite human when their\r\ndignity is touched.\r\n\r\n'Stop a minute--you don't know how funny you look!' She put her hands on\r\nher hips and laughed mercilessly.\r\n\r\n'Don't worry about that,' said Arnott, and whistled. A voice answered\r\nfrom the _Victor Pirolo_ in the meadow.\r\n\r\n'Only a single-fuse ground-circuit!' Arnott called. 'Sort it out gently,\r\nplease.'\r\n\r\nWe heard the ping of a breaking lamp; a fuse blew out somewhere in the\r\nverandah roof, frightening a nestful of birds. The ground-circuit was\r\nopen. We stooped and rubbed our tingling ankles.\r\n\r\n'How rude--how very rude of you!' the maiden cried.\r\n\r\n''Sorry, but we haven't time to look funny,' said Arnott. 'We've got to\r\ngo to Chicago; and if I were you, young lady, I'd go into the cellars\r\nfor the next two hours, and take mother with me.'\r\n\r\nOff he strode, with us at his heels, muttering indignantly, till the\r\nhumour of the thing struck and doubled him up with laughter at the foot\r\nof the gang-way ladder.\r\n\r\n'The Board hasn't shown what you might call a fat spark on this\r\noccasion,' said De Forest, wiping his eyes. 'I hope I didn't look as big\r\na fool as you did, Arnott! Hullo! What on earth is that? Dad coming home\r\nfrom Chicago?'\r\n\r\nThere was a rattle and a rush, and a five-plough cultivator, blades in\r\nair like so many teeth, trundled itself at us round the edge of the\r\ntimber, fuming and sparking furiously.\r\n\r\n'Jump!' said Arnott, as we bundled ourselves through the none-too-wide\r\ndoor. 'Never mind about shutting it. Up!'\r\n\r\nThe _Victor Pirolo_ lifted like a bubble, and the vicious machine shot\r\njust underneath us, clawing high as it passed.\r\n\r\n'There's a nice little spit-kitten for you!' said Arnott, dusting his\r\nknees. 'We ask her a civil question. First she circuits us and then she\r\nplays a cultivator at us!'\r\n\r\n'And then we fly,' said Dragomiroff. 'If I were forty years more young,\r\nI would go back and kiss her. Ho! Ho!'\r\n\r\n'I,' said Pirolo, 'would smack her! My pet ship has been chased by a\r\ndirty plough; a--how do you say?--agricultural implement.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, that is Illinois all over,' said De Forest. 'They don't content\r\nthemselves with talking about privacy. They arrange to have it. And now,\r\nwhere's your alleged fleet, Arnott? We must assert ourselves against\r\nthis wench.'\r\n\r\nArnott pointed to the black heavens.\r\n\r\n'Waiting on--up there,' said he. 'Shall I give them the whole\r\ninstallation, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I don't think the young lady is quite worth that,' said De Forest.\r\n'Get over Chicago, and perhaps we'll see something.'\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes we were hanging at two thousand feet over an oblong\r\nblock of incandescence in the centre of the little town.\r\n\r\n'That looks like the old City Hall. Yes, there's Salati's Statue in\r\nfront of it,' said Takahira. 'But what on earth are they doing to the\r\nplace? I thought they used it for a market nowadays! Drop a\r\nlittle, please.'\r\n\r\nWe could hear the sputter and crackle of road-surfacing machines--the\r\ncheap Western type which fuse stone and rubbish into lava-like ribbed\r\nglass for their rough country roads. Three or four surfacers worked on\r\neach side of a square of ruins. The brick and stone wreckage crumbled,\r\nslid forward, and presently spread out into white-hot pools of sticky\r\nslag, which the levelling-rods smoothed more or less flat. Already a\r\nthird of the big block had been so treated, and was cooling to dull red\r\nbefore our astonished eyes.\r\n\r\n'It is the Old Market,' said De Forest. 'Well, there's nothing to\r\nprevent Illinois from making a road through a market. It doesn't\r\ninterfere with traffic, that I can see.'\r\n\r\n'Hsh!' said Arnott, gripping me by the shoulder. 'Listen! They're\r\nsinging. Why on the earth are they singing?'\r\n\r\nWe dropped again till we could see the black fringe of people at the\r\nedge of that glowing square.\r\n\r\nAt first they only roared against the roar of the surfacers and\r\nlevellers. Then the words came up clearly--the words of the Forbidden\r\nSong that all men knew, and none let pass their lips--poor Pat\r\nMacDonough's Song, made in the days of the Crowds and the Plague--every\r\nsilly word of it loaded to sparking-point with the Planet's inherited\r\nmemories of horror, panic, fear and cruelty. And Chicago--innocent,\r\ncontented little Chicago--was singing it aloud to the infernal tune that\r\ncarried riot, pestilence and lunacy round our Planet a few\r\ngenerations ago!\r\n\r\n     'Once there was The People--Terror gave it birth;\r\n     Once there was The People, and it made a hell of earth!'\r\n\r\n(Then the stamp and pause):\r\n\r\n     'Earth arose and crushed it. Listen, oh, ye slain!\r\n     Once there was The People--it shall never be again!'\r\n\r\nThe levellers thrust in savagely against the ruins as the song renewed\r\nitself again, again and again, louder than the crash of the\r\nmelting walls.\r\n\r\nDe Forest frowned.\r\n\r\n'I don't like that,' he said. 'They've broken back to the Old Days!\r\nThey'll be killing somebody soon. I think we'd better divert\r\n'em, Arnott.'\r\n\r\n'Ay, ay, sir.' Arnott's hand went to his cap, and we heard the hull of\r\nthe _Victor Pirolo_ ring to the command: 'Lamps! Both watches stand by!\r\nLamps! Lamps! Lamps!'\r\n\r\n'Keep still!' Takahira whispered to me. 'Blinkers, please,\r\nquartermaster.'\r\n\r\n'It's all right--all right!' said Pirolo from behind, and to my horror\r\nslipped over my head some sort of rubber helmet that locked with a snap.\r\nI could feel thick colloid bosses before my eyes, but I stood in\r\nabsolute darkness.\r\n\r\n'To save the sight,' he explained, and pushed me on to the chart-room\r\ndivan. 'You will see in a minute.'\r\n\r\nAs he spoke I became aware of a thin thread of almost intolerable light,\r\nlet down from heaven at an immense distance--one vertical hairsbreadth\r\nof frozen lightning.\r\n\r\n'Those are our flanking ships,' said Arnott at my elbow. 'That one is\r\nover Galena. Look south--that other one's over Keithburg. Vincennes is\r\nbehind us, and north yonder is Winthrop Woods. The Fleet's in position,\r\nsir'--this to De Forest. 'As soon as you give the word.'\r\n\r\n'Ah no! No!' cried Dragomiroff at my side. I could feel the old man\r\ntremble. 'I do not know all that you can do, but be kind! I ask you to\r\nbe a little kind to them below! This is horrible--horrible!'\r\n\r\n     'When a Woman kills a Chicken,\r\n     Dynasties and Empires sicken,'\r\n\r\nTakahira quoted. 'It is too late to be gentle now.'\r\n\r\n'Then take off my helmet! Take off my helmet!' Dragomiroff began\r\nhysterically.\r\n\r\nPirolo must have put his arm round him.\r\n\r\n'Hush,' he said, 'I am here. It is all right, Ivan, my dear fellow.'\r\n\r\n'I'll just send our little girl in Bureau County a warning,' said\r\nArnott. 'She don't deserve it, but we'll allow her a minute or two to\r\ntake mamma to the cellar.'\r\n\r\nIn the utter hush that followed the growling spark after Arnott had\r\nlinked up his Service Communicator with the invisible Fleet, we heard\r\nMacDonough's Song from the city beneath us grow fainter as we rose to\r\nposition. Then I clapped my hand before my mask lenses, for it was as\r\nthough the floor of Heaven had been riddled and all the inconceivable\r\nblaze of suns in the making was poured through the manholes.\r\n\r\n'You needn't count,' said Arnott. I had had no thought of such a thing.\r\n'There are two hundred and fifty keels up there, five miles apart. Full\r\npower, please, for another twelve seconds.'\r\n\r\nThe firmament, as far as eye could reach, stood on pillars of white\r\nfire. One fell on the glowing square at Chicago, and turned it black.\r\n\r\n'Oh! Oh! Oh! Can men be allowed to do such things?' Dragomiroff cried,\r\nand fell across our knees.\r\n\r\n'Glass of water, please,' said Takahira to a helmeted shape that leaped\r\nforward. 'He is a little faint.'\r\n\r\nThe lights switched off, and the darkness stunned like an avalanche. We\r\ncould hear Dragomiroff's teeth on the glass edge.\r\n\r\nPirolo was comforting him.\r\n\r\n'All right, all ra-ight,' he repeated. 'Come and lie down. Come below\r\nand take off your mask. I give you my word, old friend, it is all right.\r\nThey are my siege-lights. Little Victor Pirolo's leetle lights. You know\r\n_me_! I do not hurt people.'\r\n\r\n'Pardon!' Dragomiroff moaned. 'I have never seen Death. I have never\r\nseen the Board take action. Shall we go down and burn them alive, or is\r\nthat already done?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, hush,' said Pirolo, and I think he rocked him in his arms.\r\n\r\n'Do we repeat, sir?' Arnott asked De Forest.\r\n\r\n'Give 'em a minute's break,' De Forest replied. 'They may need it.'\r\n\r\nWe waited a minute, and then MacDonough's Song, broken but defiant, rose\r\nfrom undefeated Chicago.\r\n\r\n'They seem fond of that tune,' said De Forest. 'I should let 'em have\r\nit, Arnott.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir,' said Arnott, and felt his way to the Communicator\r\nkeys.\r\n\r\nNo lights broke forth, but the hollow of the skies made herself the\r\nmouth for one note that touched the raw fibre of the brain. Men hear\r\nsuch sounds in delirium, advancing like tides from horizons beyond the\r\nruled foreshores of space.\r\n\r\n'That's our pitch-pipe,' said Arnott. 'We may be a bit ragged. I've\r\nnever conducted two hundred and fifty performers before.' He pulled out\r\nthe couplers, and struck a full chord on the Service Communicators.\r\n\r\nThe beams of light leaped down again, and danced, solemnly and awfully,\r\na stilt-dance, sweeping thirty or forty miles left and right at each\r\nstiff-legged kick, while the darkness delivered itself--there is no\r\nscale to measure against that utterance--of the tune to which they kept\r\ntime. Certain notes--one learnt to expect them with terror--cut through\r\none's marrow, but, after three minutes, thought and emotion passed in\r\nindescribable agony.\r\n\r\nWe saw, we heard, but I think we were in some sort swooning. The two\r\nhundred and fifty beams shifted, re-formed, straddled and split,\r\nnarrowed, widened, rippled in ribbons, broke into a thousand white-hot\r\nparallel lines, melted and revolved in interwoven rings like\r\nold-fashioned engine-turning, flung up to the zenith, made as if to\r\ndescend and renew the torment, halted at the last instant, twizzled\r\ninsanely round the horizon, and vanished, to bring back for the\r\nhundredth time darkness more shattering than their instantly renewed\r\nlight over all Illinois. Then the tune and lights ceased together, and\r\nwe heard one single devastating wail that shook all the horizon as a\r\nrubbed wet finger shakes the rim of a bowl.\r\n\r\n'Ah, that is my new siren,' said Pirolo. 'You can break an iceberg in\r\nhalf, if you find the proper pitch. They will whistle by squadrons now.\r\nIt is the wind through pierced shutters in the bows.'\r\n\r\nI had collapsed beside Dragomiroff, broken and snivelling feebly,\r\nbecause I had been delivered before my time to all the terrors of\r\nJudgment Day, and the Archangels of the Resurrection were hailing me\r\nnaked across the Universe to the sound of the music of the spheres.\r\n\r\nThen I saw De Forest smacking Arnott's helmet with his open hand. The\r\nwailing died down in a long shriek as a black shadow swooped past us,\r\nand returned to her place above the lower clouds.\r\n\r\n'I hate to interrupt a specialist when he's enjoying himself,' said De\r\nForest. 'But, as a matter of fact, all Illinois has been asking us to\r\nstop for these last fifteen seconds.'\r\n\r\n'What a pity.' Arnott slipped off his mask. 'I wanted you to hear us\r\nreally hum. Our lower C can lift street-paving.'\r\n\r\n'It is Hell--Hell!' cried Dragomiroff, and sobbed aloud.\r\n\r\nArnott looked away as he answered:\r\n\r\n'It's a few thousand volts ahead of the old shoot-'em-and-sink-'em game,\r\nbut I should scarcely call it _that_. What shall I tell the Fleet, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Tell 'em we're very pleased and impressed. I don't think they need wait\r\non any longer. There isn't a spark left down there.' De Forest pointed.\r\n'They'll be deaf and blind.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I think not, sir. The demonstration lasted less than ten minutes.'\r\n\r\n'Marvellous!' Takahira sighed. 'I should have said it was half a night.\r\nNow, shall we go down and pick up the pieces?'\r\n\r\n'But first a small drink,' said Pirolo. 'The Board must not arrive\r\nweeping at its own works.'\r\n\r\n'I am an old fool--an old fool!' Dragomiroff began piteously. 'I did not\r\nknow what would happen. It is all new to me. We reason with them in\r\nLittle Russia.'\r\n\r\nChicago North landing-tower was unlighted, and Arnott worked his ship\r\ninto the clips by her own lights. As soon as these broke out we heard\r\ngroanings of horror and appeal from many people below.\r\n\r\n'All right,' shouted Arnott into the darkness. 'We aren't beginning\r\nagain!' We descended by the stairs, to find ourselves knee-deep in a\r\ngrovelling crowd, some crying that they were blind, others beseeching us\r\nnot to make any more noises, but the greater part writhing face\r\ndownward, their hands or their caps before their eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was Pirolo who came to our rescue. He climbed the side of a\r\nsurfacing-machine, and there, gesticulating as though they could see,\r\nmade oration to those afflicted people of Illinois.\r\n\r\n'You stchewpids!' he began. 'There is nothing to fuss for. Of course,\r\nyour eyes will smart and be red to-morrow. You will look as if you and\r\nyour wives had drunk too much, but in a little while you will see again\r\nas well as before. I tell you this, and I--I am Pirolo. Victor Pirolo!'\r\n\r\nThe crowd with one accord shuddered, for many legends attach to Victor\r\nPirolo of Foggia, deep in the secrets of God.\r\n\r\n'Pirolo?' An unsteady voice lifted itself. 'Then tell us was there\r\nanything except light in those lights of yours just now?'\r\n\r\nThe question was repeated from every corner of the darkness.\r\n\r\nPirolo laughed.\r\n\r\n'No!' he thundered. (Why have small men such large voices?) 'I give you\r\nmy word and the Board's word that there was nothing except light--just\r\nlight! You stchewpids! Your birth-rate is too low already as it is. Some\r\nday I must invent something to send it up, but send it down--never!'\r\n\r\n'Is that true?--We thought--somebody said--'\r\n\r\nOne could feel the tension relax all round.\r\n\r\n'You too big fools,' Pirolo cried. 'You could have sent us a call and we\r\nwould have told you.'\r\n\r\n'Send you a call!' a deep voice shouted. 'I wish you had been at our end\r\nof the wire.'\r\n\r\n'I'm glad I wasn't,' said De Forest. 'It was bad enough from behind the\r\nlamps. Never mind! It's over now. Is there any one here I can talk\r\nbusiness with? I'm De Forest--for the Board.'\r\n\r\n'You might begin with me, for one--I'm Mayor,' the bass voice replied.\r\n\r\nA big man rose unsteadily from the street, and staggered towards us\r\nwhere we sat on the broad turf-edging, in front of the garden fences.\r\n\r\n'I ought to be the first on my feet. Am I?' said he.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said De Forest, and steadied him as he dropped down beside us.\r\n\r\n'Hello, Andy. Is that you?' a voice called.\r\n\r\n'Excuse me,' said the Mayor; 'that sounds like my Chief of Police,\r\nBluthner!'\r\n\r\n'Bluthner it is; and here's Mulligan and Keefe--on their feet.'\r\n\r\n'Bring 'em up please, Blut. We're supposed to be the Four in charge of\r\nthis hamlet. What we says, goes. And, De Forest, what do you say?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing--yet,' De Forest answered, as we made room for the panting,\r\nreeling men. '_You've_ cut out of system. Well?'\r\n\r\n'Tell the steward to send down drinks, please,' Arnott whispered to an\r\norderly at his side.\r\n\r\n'Good!' said the Mayor, smacking his dry lips. 'Now I suppose we can\r\ntake it, De Forest, that henceforward the Board will administer\r\nus direct?'\r\n\r\n'Not if the Board can avoid it,' De Forest laughed. 'The A.B.C. is\r\nresponsible for the planetary traffic only.'\r\n\r\n'_And all that that implies_.' The big Four who ran Chicago chanted\r\ntheir Magna Charta like children at school.\r\n\r\n'Well, get on,' said De Forest wearily. 'What is your silly trouble\r\nanyway?'\r\n\r\n'Too much dam' Democracy,' said the Mayor, laying his hand on De\r\nForest's knee.\r\n\r\n'So? I thought Illinois had had her dose of that.'\r\n\r\n'She has. That's why. Blut, what did you do with our prisoners last\r\nnight?'\r\n\r\n'Locked 'em in the water-tower to prevent the women killing 'em,' the\r\nChief of Police replied. 'I'm too blind to move just yet, but--'\r\n\r\n'Arnott, send some of your people, please, and fetch 'em along,' said De\r\nForest.\r\n\r\n'They're triple-circuited,' the Mayor called. 'You'll have to blow out\r\nthree fuses.' He turned to De Forest, his large outline just visible in\r\nthe paling darkness. 'I hate to throw any more work on the Board. I'm an\r\nadministrator myself, but we've had a little fuss with our Serviles.\r\nWhat? In a big city there's bound to be a few men and women who can't\r\nlive without listening to themselves, and who prefer drinking out of\r\npipes they don't own both ends of. They inhabit flats and hotels all the\r\nyear round. They say it saves 'em trouble. Anyway, it gives 'em more\r\ntime to make trouble for their neighbours. We call 'em Serviles locally.\r\nAnd they are apt to be tuberculous.'\r\n\r\n'Just so!' said the man called Mulligan. Transportation is Civilisation.\r\nDemocracy is Disease. I've proved it by the blood-test, every time.'\r\n\r\n'Mulligan's our Health Officer, and a one-idea man,' said the Mayor,\r\nlaughing. 'But it's true that most Serviles haven't much control. They\r\n_will_ talk; and when people take to talking as a business, anything may\r\narrive--mayn't it, De Forest?'\r\n\r\n'Anything--except the facts of the case,' said De Forest, laughing.\r\n\r\n'I'll give you those in a minute,' said the Mayor. 'Our Serviles got to\r\ntalking--first in their houses and then on the streets, telling men and\r\nwomen how to manage their own affairs. (You can't teach a Servile not to\r\nfinger his neighbour's soul.) That's invasion of privacy, of course, but\r\nin Chicago we'll suffer anything sooner than make Crowds. Nobody took\r\nmuch notice, and so I let 'em alone. My fault! I was warned there would\r\nbe trouble, but there hasn't been a Crowd or murder in Illinois for\r\nnineteen years.'\r\n\r\n'Twenty-two,' said his Chief of Police.\r\n\r\n'Likely. Anyway, we'd forgot such things. So, from talking in the houses\r\nand on the streets, our Serviles go to calling a meeting at the Old\r\nMarket yonder.' He nodded across the square where the wrecked buildings\r\nheaved up grey in the dawn-glimmer behind the square-cased statue of The\r\nNegro in Flames. 'There's nothing to prevent any one calling meetings\r\nexcept that it's against human nature to stand in a Crowd, besides being\r\nbad for the health. I ought to have known by the way our men and women\r\nattended that first meeting that trouble was brewing. There were as many\r\nas a thousand in the market-place, touching each other. Touching! Then\r\nthe Serviles turned in all tongue-switches and talked, and we--'\r\n\r\n'What did they talk about?' said Takahira.\r\n\r\n'First, how badly things were managed in the city. That pleased us\r\nFour--we were on the platform--because we hoped to catch one or two\r\ngood men for City work. You know how rare executive capacity is. Even if\r\nwe didn't it's--it's refreshing to find any one interested enough in our\r\njob to damn our eyes. You don't know what it means to work, year in,\r\nyear out, without a spark of difference with a living soul.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, don't we!' said De Forest. 'There are times on the Board when we'd\r\ngive our positions if any one would kick us out and take hold of things\r\nthemselves.'\r\n\r\n'But they won't,' said the Mayor ruefully. 'I assure you, sir, we Four\r\nhave done things in Chicago, in the hope of rousing people, that would\r\nhave discredited Nero. But what do they say? \"Very good, Andy. Have it\r\nyour own way. Anything's better than a Crowd. I'll go back to my land.\"\r\nYou _can't_ do anything with folk who can go where they please, and\r\ndon't want anything on God's earth except their own way. There isn't a\r\nkick or a kicker left on the Planet.'\r\n\r\n'Then I suppose that little shed yonder fell down by itself?' said De\r\nForest. We could see the bare and still smoking ruins, and hear the\r\nslag-pools crackle as they hardened and set.\r\n\r\n'Oh, that's only amusement. 'Tell you later. As I was saying, our\r\nServiles held the meeting, and pretty soon we had to ground-circuit the\r\nplatform to save 'em from being killed. And that didn't make our people\r\nany more pacific.'\r\n\r\n'How d'you mean?' I ventured to ask.\r\n\r\n'If you've ever been ground-circuited,' said the Mayor, 'you'll know it\r\ndon't improve any man's temper to be held up straining against nothing.\r\nNo, sir! Eight or nine hundred folk kept pawing and buzzing like flies\r\nin treacle for two hours, while a pack of perfectly safe Serviles\r\ninvades their mental and spiritual privacy, may be amusing to watch, but\r\nthey are not pleasant to handle afterwards.'\r\n\r\nPirolo chuckled.\r\n\r\n'Our folk own themselves. They were of opinion things were going too far\r\nand too fiery. I warned the Serviles; but they're born house-dwellers.\r\nUnless a fact hits 'em on the head they cannot see it. Would you believe\r\nme, they went on to talk of what they called \"popular government\"? They\r\ndid! They wanted us to go back to the old Voodoo-business of voting with\r\npapers and wooden boxes, and word-drunk people and printed formulas, and\r\nnews-sheets! They said they practised it among themselves about what\r\nthey'd have to eat in their flats and hotels. Yes, sir! They stood up\r\nbehind Bluthner's doubled ground-circuits, and they said that, in this\r\npresent year of grace, _to_ self-owning men and women, _on_ that very\r\nspot! Then they finished'--he lowered his voice cautiously--'by talking\r\nabout \"The People.\" And then Bluthner he had to sit up all night in\r\ncharge of the circuits because he couldn't trust his men to keep\r\n'em shut.'\r\n\r\n'It was trying 'em too high,' the Chief of Police broke in. 'But we\r\ncouldn't hold the Crowd ground-circuited for ever. I gathered in all the\r\nServiles on charge of Crowd-making, and put 'em in the water-tower, and\r\nthen I let things cut loose. I had to! The District lit like a sparked\r\ngas-tank!'\r\n\r\n'The news was out over seven degrees of country,' the Mayor continued;\r\n'and when once it's a question of invasion of privacy, good-bye to right\r\nand reason in Illinois! They began turning out traffic-lights and\r\nlocking up landing-towers on Thursday night. Friday, they stopped all\r\ntraffic and asked for the Board to take over. Then they wanted to clean\r\nChicago off the side of the Lake and rebuild elsewhere--just for a\r\nsouvenir of \"The People\" that the Serviles talked about. I suggested\r\nthat they should slag the Old Market where the meeting was held, while I\r\nturned in a call to you all on the Board. That kept 'em quiet till you\r\ncame along. And--and now _you_ can take hold of the situation.'\r\n\r\n'Any chance of their quieting down?' De Forest asked.\r\n\r\n'You can try,' said the Mayor.\r\n\r\nDe Forest raised his voice in the face of the reviving Crowd that had\r\nedged in towards us. Day was come.\r\n\r\n'Don't you think this business can be arranged?' he began. But there was\r\na roar of angry voices:\r\n\r\n'We've finished with Crowds! We aren't going back to the Old Days! Take\r\nus over! Take the Serviles away! Administer direct or we'll kill 'em!\r\nDown with The People!'\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made to begin MacDonough's Song. It got no further than\r\nthe first line, for the _Victor Pirolo_ sent down a warning drone on one\r\nstopped horn. A wrecked side-wall of the Old Market tottered and fell\r\ninwards on the slag-pools. None spoke or moved till the last of the dust\r\nhad settled down again, turning the steel case of Salati's Statue\r\nashy grey.\r\n\r\n'You see you'll just _have_ to take us over,' the Mayor whispered.\r\n\r\nDe Forest shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n'You talk as if executive capacity could be snatched out of the air like\r\nso much horse-power. Can't you manage yourselves on any terms?' he said.\r\n\r\n'We can, if you say so. It will only cost those few lives to begin\r\nwith,'\r\n\r\nThe Mayor pointed across the square, where Arnott's men guided a\r\nstumbling group of ten or twelve men and women to the lake front and\r\nhalted them under the Statue.\r\n\r\n'Now I think,' said Takahira under his breath, 'there will be trouble.'\r\n\r\nThe mass in front of us growled like beasts.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the sun rose clear, and revealed the blinking assembly to\r\nitself. As soon as it realized that it was a crowd we saw the shiver of\r\nhorror and mutual repulsion shoot across it precisely as the steely\r\nflaws shot across the lake outside. Nothing was said, and, being half\r\nblind, of course it moved slowly. Yet in less than fifteen minutes most\r\nof that vast multitude--three thousand at the lowest count--melted away\r\nlike frost on south eaves. The remnant stretched themselves on the\r\ngrass, where a crowd feels and looks less like a crowd.\r\n\r\n'These mean business,' the Mayor whispered to Takahira. 'There are a\r\ngoodish few women there who've borne children. I don't like it.'\r\n\r\nThe morning draught off the lake stirred the trees round us with promise\r\nof a hot day; the sun reflected itself dazzlingly on the canister-shaped\r\ncovering of Salati's Statue; cocks crew in the gardens, and we could\r\nhear gate-latches clicking in the distance as people stumblingly\r\nresought their homes.\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid there won't be any morning deliveries,' said De Forest. 'We\r\nrather upset things in the country last night.'\r\n\r\n'That makes no odds,' the Mayor returned. 'We're all provisioned for six\r\nmonths. _We_ take no chances.'\r\n\r\nNor, when you come to think of it, does any one else. It must be\r\nthree-quarters of a generation since any house or city faced a food\r\nshortage. Yet is there house or city on the Planet to-day that has not\r\nhalf a year's provisions laid in? We are like the shipwrecked seamen in\r\nthe old books, who, having once nearly starved to death, ever afterwards\r\nhide away bits of food and biscuit. Truly we trust no Crowds, nor system\r\nbased on Crowds!\r\n\r\nDe Forest waited till the last footstep had died away. Meantime the\r\nprisoners at the base of the Statue shuffled, posed, and fidgeted, with\r\nthe shamelessness of quite little children. None of them were more than\r\nsix feet high, and many of them were as grey-haired as the ravaged,\r\nharassed heads of old pictures. They huddled together in actual touch,\r\nwhile the crowd, spaced at large intervals, looked at them with\r\ncongested eyes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a man among them began to talk. The Mayor had not in the least\r\nexaggerated. It appeared that our Planet lay sunk in slavery beneath the\r\nheel of the Aërial Board of Control. The orator urged us to arise in our\r\nmight, burst our prison doors and break our fetters (all his metaphors,\r\nby the way, were of the most mediæval). Next he demanded that every\r\nmatter of daily life, including most of the physical functions, should\r\nbe submitted for decision at any time of the week, month, or year to, I\r\ngathered, anybody who happened to be passing by or residing within a\r\ncertain radius, and that everybody should forthwith abandon his concerns\r\nto settle the matter, first by crowd-making, next by talking to the\r\ncrowds made, and lastly by describing crosses on pieces of paper, which\r\nrubbish should later be counted with certain mystic ceremonies and\r\noaths. Out of this amazing play, he assured us, would automatically\r\narise a higher, nobler, and kinder world, based--he demonstrated this\r\nwith the awful lucidity of the insane--based on the sanctity of the\r\nCrowd and the villainy of the single person. In conclusion, he called\r\nloudly upon God to testify to his personal merits and integrity. When\r\nthe flow ceased, I turned bewildered to Takahira, who was\r\nnodding solemnly.\r\n\r\n'Quite correct,' said he. 'It is all in the old books. He has left\r\nnothing out, not even the war-talk.'\r\n\r\n'But I don't see how this stuff can upset a child, much less a\r\ndistrict,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Ah, you are too young,' said Dragomiroff. 'For another thing, you are\r\nnot a mamma. Please look at the mammas.'\r\n\r\nTen or fifteen women who remained had separated themselves from the\r\nsilent men, and were drawing in towards the prisoners. It reminded one\r\nof the stealthy encircling, before the rush in at the quarry, of wolves\r\nround musk-oxen in the North. The prisoners saw, and drew together more\r\nclosely. The Mayor covered his face with his hands for an instant. De\r\nForest, bareheaded, stepped forward between the prisoners, and the\r\nslowly, stiffly moving line.\r\n\r\n'That's all very interesting,' he said to the dry-lipped orator. 'But\r\nthe point seems that you've been making crowds and invading privacy.'\r\n\r\nA woman stepped forward, and would have spoken, but there was a quick\r\nassenting murmur from the men, who realised that De Forest was trying to\r\npull the situation down to ground-line.\r\n\r\n'Yes! Yes!' they cried. 'We cut out because they made crowds and invaded\r\nprivacy! Stick to that! Keep on that switch! Lift the Serviles out of\r\nthis! The Board's in charge! Hsh!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, the Board's in charge,' said De Forest. 'I'll take formal evidence\r\nof crowd-making if you like, but the Members of the Board can testify to\r\nit. Will that do?'\r\n\r\nThe women had closed in another pace, with hands that clenched and\r\nunclenched at their sides.\r\n\r\n'Good! Good enough!' the men cried. 'We're content. Only take them away\r\nquickly.'\r\n\r\n'Come along up!' said De Forest to the captives, 'Breakfast is quite\r\nready.'\r\n\r\nIt appeared, however, that they did not wish to go. They intended to\r\nremain in Chicago and make crowds. They pointed out that De Forest's\r\nproposal was gross invasion of privacy.\r\n\r\n'My dear fellow,' said Pirolo to the most voluble of the leaders, 'you\r\nhurry, or your crowd that can't be wrong will kill you!'\r\n\r\n'But that would be murder,' answered the believer in crowds; and there\r\nwas a roar of laughter from all sides that seemed to show the crisis\r\nhad broken.\r\n\r\nA woman stepped forward from the line of women, laughing, I protest, as\r\nmerrily as any of the company. One hand, of course, shaded her eyes, the\r\nother was at her throat.\r\n\r\n'Oh, they needn't be afraid of being killed!' she called.\r\n\r\n'Not in the least,' said De Forest. 'But don't you think that, now the\r\nBoard's in charge, you might go home while we get these people away?'\r\n\r\n'I shall be home long before that. It--it has been rather a trying day.'\r\n\r\nShe stood up to her full height, dwarfing even De Forest's\r\nsix-foot-eight, and smiled, with eyes closed against the fierce light.\r\n\r\n'Yes, rather,' said De Forest. 'I'm afraid you feel the glare a little.\r\nWe'll have the ship down.'\r\n\r\nHe motioned to the _Pirolo_ to drop between us and the sun, and at the\r\nsame time to loop-circuit the prisoners, who were a trifle unsteady. We\r\nsaw them stiffen to the current where they stood. The woman's voice went\r\non, sweet and deep and unshaken:\r\n\r\n'I don't suppose you men realise how much this--this sort of thing means\r\nto a woman. I've borne three. We women don't want our children given to\r\nCrowds. It must be an inherited instinct. Crowds make trouble. They\r\nbring back the Old Days. Hate, fear, blackmail, publicity, \"The\r\nPeople\"--_That! That! That_!' She pointed to the Statue, and the crowd\r\ngrowled once more.\r\n\r\n'Yes, if they are allowed to go on,' said De Forest. 'But this little\r\naffair--'\r\n\r\n'It means so much to us women that this--this little affair should never\r\nhappen again. Of course, never's a big word, but one feels so strongly\r\nthat it is important to stop crowds at the very beginning. Those\r\ncreatures'--she pointed with her left hand at the prisoners swaying like\r\nseaweed in a tideway as the circuit pulled them--'those people have\r\nfriends and wives and children in the city and elsewhere. One doesn't\r\nwant anything done to _them_, you know. It's terrible to force a human\r\nbeing out of fifty or sixty years of good life. I'm only forty myself.\r\n_I_ know. But, at the same time, one feels that an example should be\r\nmade, because no price is too heavy to pay if--if these people and _all\r\nthat they imply_ can be put an end to. Do you quite understand, or would\r\nyou be kind enough to tell your men to take the casing off the Statue?\r\nIt's worth looking at.'\r\n\r\n'I understand perfectly. But I don't think anybody here wants to see\r\nthe Statue on an empty stomach. Excuse me one moment.' De Forest called\r\nup to the ship, 'A flying loop ready on the port side, if you please.'\r\nThen to the woman he said with some crispness, 'You might leave us a\r\nlittle discretion in the matter.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, of course. Thank you for being so patient. I know my arguments are\r\nsilly, but--' She half turned away and went on in a changed voice,\r\n'Perhaps this will help you to decide.'\r\n\r\nShe threw out her right arm with a knife in it. Before the blade could\r\nbe returned to her throat or her bosom it was twitched from her grip,\r\nsparked as it flew out of the shadow of the ship above, and fell\r\nflashing in the sunshine at the foot of the Statue fifty yards away. The\r\noutflung arm was arrested, rigid as a bar for an instant, till the\r\nreleasing circuit permitted her to bring it slowly to her side. The\r\nother women shrank back silent among the men.\r\n\r\nPirolo rubbed his hands, and Takahira nodded.\r\n\r\n'That was clever of you, De Forest,' said he.\r\n\r\n'What a glorious pose!' Dragomiroff murmured, for the frightened woman\r\nwas on the edge of tears.\r\n\r\n'Why did you stop me? I would have done it!' she cried.\r\n\r\n'I have no doubt you would,' said De Forest. 'But we can't waste a life\r\nlike yours on these people. I hope the arrest didn't sprain your wrist;\r\nit's so hard to regulate a flying loop. But I think you are quite right\r\nabout those persons' women and children. We'll take them all away with\r\nus if you promise not to do anything stupid to yourself.'\r\n\r\n'I promise--I promise.' She controlled herself with an effort. 'But it\r\nis so important to us women. We know what it means; and I thought if you\r\nsaw I was in earnest--'\r\n\r\n'I saw you were, and you've gained your point. I shall take all your\r\nServiles away with me at once. The Mayor will make lists of their\r\nfriends and families in the city and the district, and he'll ship them\r\nafter us this afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'Sure,' said the Mayor, rising to his feet. 'Keefe, if you can see,\r\nhadn't you better finish levelling off the Old Market? It don't look\r\nsightly the way it is now, and we shan't use it for crowds any more.'\r\n\r\n'I think you had better wipe out that Statue as well, Mr. Mayor,' said\r\nDe Forest. 'I don't question its merits as a work of art, but I believe\r\nit's a shade morbid.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly, sir. Oh, Keefe! Slag the Nigger before you go on to fuse the\r\nMarket. I'll get to the Communicators and tell the District that the\r\nBoard is in charge. Are you making any special appointments, sir?'\r\n\r\n'None. We haven't men to waste on these back-woods. Carry on as before,\r\nbut under the Board. Arnott, run your Serviles aboard, please. Ground\r\nship and pass them through the bilge-doors. We'll wait till we've\r\nfinished with this work of art.'\r\n\r\nThe prisoners trailed past him, talking fluently, but unable to\r\ngesticulate in the drag of the current. Then the surfacers rolled up,\r\ntwo on each side of the Statue. With one accord the spectators looked\r\nelsewhere, but there was no need. Keefe turned on full power, and the\r\nthing simply melted within its case. All I saw was a surge of white-hot\r\nmetal pouring over the plinth, a glimpse of Salati's inscription, 'To the\r\nEternal Memory of the Justice of the People,' ere the stone base itself\r\ncracked and powdered into finest lime. The crowd cheered.\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' said De Forest; 'but we want our break-fasts, and I expect\r\nyou do too. Good-bye, Mr. Mayor! Delighted to see you at any time, but I\r\nhope I shan't have to, officially, for the next thirty years. Good-bye,\r\nmadam. Yes. We're all given to nerves nowadays. I suffer from them\r\nmyself. Good-bye, gentlemen all! You're under the tyrannous heel of the\r\nBoard from this moment, but if ever you feel like breaking your fetters\r\nyou've only to let us know. This is no treat to us. Good luck!'\r\n\r\nWe embarked amid shouts, and did not check our lift till they had\r\ndwindled into whispers. Then De Forest flung himself on the chart-room\r\ndivan and mopped his forehead.\r\n\r\n'I don't mind men,' he panted, 'but women are the devil!'\r\n\r\n'Still the devil,' said Pirolo cheerfully. 'That one would have\r\nsuicided.'\r\n\r\n'I know it. That was why I signalled for the flying loop to be clapped\r\non her. I owe you an apology for that, Arnott. I hadn't time to catch\r\nyour eye, and you were busy with our caitiffs. By the way, who actually\r\nanswered my signal? It was a smart piece of work.'\r\n\r\n'Ilroy,' said Arnott; 'but he overloaded the wave. It may be pretty\r\ngallery-work to knock a knife out of a lady's hand, but didn't you\r\nnotice how she rubbed 'em? He scorched her fingers. Slovenly, I\r\ncall it.'\r\n\r\n'Far be it from me to interfere with Fleet discipline, but don't be too\r\nhard on the boy. If that woman had killed herself they would have killed\r\nevery Servile and everything related to a Servile throughout the\r\ndistrict by nightfall.'\r\n\r\n'That was what she was playing for,' Takahira said. 'And with our Fleet\r\ngone we could have done nothing to hold them.'\r\n\r\n'I may be ass enough to walk into a ground-circuit,' said Arnott, 'but I\r\ndon't dismiss my Fleet till I'm reasonably sure that trouble is over.\r\nThey're in position still, and I intend to keep 'em there till the\r\nServiles are shipped out of the district. That last little crowd meant\r\nmurder, my friends.'\r\n\r\n'Nerves! All nerves!' said Pirolo. 'You cannot argue with agoraphobia.'\r\n\r\n'And it is not as if they had seen much dead--or _is_ it?' said\r\nTakahira.\r\n\r\n'In all my ninety years I have never seen Death.' Dragomiroff spoke as\r\none who would excuse himself. 'Perhaps that was why--last night--'\r\n\r\nThen it came out as we sat over breakfast, that, with the exception of\r\nArnott and Pirolo, none of us had ever seen a corpse, or knew in what\r\nmanner the spirit passes.\r\n\r\n'We're a nice lot to flap about governing the Planet,' De Forest\r\nlaughed. 'I confess, now it's all over, that my main fear was I mightn't\r\nbe able to pull it off without losing a life.'\r\n\r\n'I thought of that too,' said Arnott; 'but there's no death reported,\r\nand I've inquired everywhere. What are we supposed to do with our\r\npassengers? I've fed 'em.'\r\n\r\n'We're between two switches,' De Forest drawled. 'If we drop them in any\r\nplace that isn't under the Board the natives will make their presence an\r\nexcuse for cutting out, same as Illinois did, and forcing the Board to\r\ntake over. If we drop them in any place under the Board's control\r\nthey'll be killed as soon as our backs are turned.'\r\n\r\n'If you say so,' said Pirolo thoughtfully, 'I can guarantee that they\r\nwill become extinct in process of time, quite happily. What is their\r\nbirth-rate now?'\r\n\r\n'Go down and ask 'em,' said De Forest.\r\n\r\n'I think they might become nervous and tear me to bits,' the philosopher\r\nof Foggia replied.\r\n\r\n'Not really? Well?'\r\n\r\n'Open the bilge-doors,' said Takahira with a downward jerk of the thumb.\r\n\r\n'Scarcely--after all the trouble we've taken to save 'em,' said De\r\nForest.\r\n\r\n'Try London,' Arnott suggested. 'You could turn Satan himself loose\r\nthere, and they'd only ask him to dinner.'\r\n\r\n'Good man! You've given me an idea. Vincent! Oh, Vincent!' He threw the\r\nGeneral Communicator open so that we could all hear, and in a few\r\nminutes the chart-room filled with the rich, fruity voice of Leopold\r\nVincent, who has purveyed all London her choicest amusements for the\r\nlast thirty years. We answered with expectant grins, as though we were\r\nactually in the stalls of, say, the Combination on a first night.\r\n\r\n'We've picked up something in your line,' De Forest began.\r\n\r\n'That's good, dear man. If it's old enough. There's nothing to beat the\r\nold things for business purposes. Have you seen _London, Chatham, and\r\nDover_ at Earl's Court? No? I thought I missed you there. Immense! I've\r\nhad the real steam locomotive engines built from the old designs and the\r\niron rails cast specially by hand. Cloth cushions in the carriages, too!\r\nImmense! And paper railway tickets. And Polly Milton.'\r\n\r\n'Polly Milton back again!' said Arnott rapturously. 'Book me two stalls\r\nfor to-morrow night. What's she singing now, bless her?'\r\n\r\n'The old songs. Nothing comes up to the old touch. Listen to this, dear\r\nmen.' Vincent carolled with flourishes:\r\n\r\n     Oh, cruel lamps of London,\r\n     If tears your light could drown,\r\n     Your victims' eyes would weep them,\r\n     Oh, lights of London Town!\r\n\r\n'Then they weep.'\r\n\r\n'You see?' Pirolo waved his hands at us. 'The old world always weeped\r\nwhen it saw crowds together. It did not know why, but it weeped. We know\r\nwhy, but we do not weep, except when we pay to be made to by fat, wicked\r\nold Vincent.'\r\n\r\n'Old, yourself!' Vincent laughed. 'I'm a public benefactor, I keep the\r\nworld soft and united.'\r\n\r\n'And I'm De Forest of the Board,' said De Forest acidly, 'trying to get\r\na little business done. As I was saying, I've picked up a few people\r\nin Chicago.'\r\n\r\n'I cut out. Chicago is--'\r\n\r\n'Do listen! They're perfectly unique.'\r\n\r\n'Do they build houses of baked mudblocks while you wait--eh? That's an\r\nold contact.'\r\n\r\n'They're an untouched primitive community, with all the old ideas.'\r\n\r\n'Sewing-machines and maypole-dances? Cooking on coal-gas stoves,\r\nlighting pipes with matches, and driving horses? Gerolstein tried that\r\nlast year. An absolute blow-out!'\r\n\r\nDe Forest plugged him wrathfully, and poured out the story of our doings\r\nfor the last twenty-four hours on the top-note.\r\n\r\n'And they do it _all_ in public,' he concluded. 'You can't stop 'em. The\r\nmore public, the better they are pleased. They'll talk for hours--like\r\nyou! Now you can come in again!'\r\n\r\n'Do you really mean they know how to vote?' said Vincent. 'Can they act\r\nit?'\r\n\r\n'Act? It's their life to 'em! And you never saw such faces! Scarred\r\nlike volcanoes. Envy, hatred, and malice in plain sight. Wonderfully\r\nflexible voices. They weep, too.'\r\n\r\n'Aloud? In public?'\r\n\r\n'I guarantee. Not a spark of shame or reticence in the entire\r\ninstallation. It's the chance of your career.'\r\n\r\n'D'you say you've brought their voting props along--those papers and\r\nballot-box things?'\r\n\r\n'No, confound you! I'm not a luggage-lifter. Apply direct to the Mayor\r\nof Chicago. He'll forward you everything. Well?'\r\n\r\n'Wait a minute. Did Chicago want to kill 'em? That 'ud look well on the\r\nCommunicators.'\r\n\r\n'Yes! They were only rescued with difficulty from a howling mob--if you\r\nknow what that is.'\r\n\r\n'But I don't,' answered the Great Vincent simply.\r\n\r\n'Well then, they'll tell you themselves. They can make speeches hours\r\nlong.'\r\n\r\n'How many are there?'\r\n\r\n'By the time we ship 'em all over they'll be perhaps a hundred, counting\r\nchildren. An old world in miniature. Can't you see it?'\r\n\r\n'M-yes; but I've got to pay for it if it's a blow-out, dear man.'\r\n\r\n'They can sing the old war songs in the streets. They can get\r\nword-drunk, and make crowds, and invade privacy in the genuine\r\nold-fashioned way; and they'll do the voting trick as often as you ask\r\n'em a question.'\r\n\r\n'Too good!' said Vincent.\r\n\r\n'You unbelieving Jew! I've got a dozen head aboard here. I'll put you\r\nthrough direct. Sample 'em yourself.'\r\n\r\nHe lifted the switch and we listened. Our passengers on the lower deck\r\nat once, but not less than five at a time, explained themselves to\r\nVincent. They had been taken from the bosom of their families, stripped\r\nof their possessions, given food without finger-bowls, and cast into\r\ncaptivity in a noisome dungeon.\r\n\r\n'But look here,' said Arnott aghast; 'they're saying what isn't true. My\r\nlower deck isn't noisome, and I saw to the finger-bowls myself.'\r\n\r\n'My people talk like that sometimes in Little Russia,' said Dragomiroff.\r\n'We reason with them. We never kill. No!'\r\n\r\n'But it's not true,' Arnott insisted. 'What can you do with people who\r\ndon't tell facts? They're mad!'\r\n\r\n'Hsh!' said Pirolo, his hand to his ear. 'It is such a little time since\r\nall the Planet told lies.'\r\n\r\nWe heard Vincent silkily sympathetic. Would they, he asked, repeat their\r\nassertions in public--before a vast public? Only let Vincent give them a\r\nchance, and the Planet, they vowed, should ring with their wrongs. Their\r\naim in life--two women and a man explained it together--was to reform\r\nthe world. Oddly enough, this also had been Vincent's life-dream. He\r\noffered them an arena in which to explain, and by their living example\r\nto raise the Planet to loftier levels. He was eloquent on the moral\r\nuplift of a simple, old-world life presented in its entirety to a\r\ndeboshed civilisation.\r\n\r\nCould they--would they--for three months certain, devote themselves\r\nunder his auspices, as missionaries, to the elevation of mankind at a\r\nplace called Earl's Court, which he said, with some truth, was one of\r\nthe intellectual centres of the Planet? They thanked him, and demanded\r\n(we could hear his chuckle of delight) time to discuss and to vote on\r\nthe matter. The vote, solemnly managed by counting heads--one head, one\r\nvote--was favourable. His offer, therefore, was accepted, and they moved\r\na vote of thanks to him in two speeches--one by what they called the\r\n'proposer' and the other by the 'seconder.'\r\n\r\nVincent threw over to us, his voice shaking with gratitude:\r\n\r\n'I've got 'em! Did you hear those speeches? That's Nature, dear men. Art\r\ncan't teach _that._ And they voted as easily as lying. I've never had a\r\ntroupe of natural liars before. Bless you, dear men! Remember, you're on\r\nmy free lists for ever, anywhere--all of you. Oh, Gerolstein will be\r\nsick--sick!'\r\n\r\n'Then you think they'll do?' said De Forest.\r\n\r\n'Do? The Little Village'll go crazy! I'll knock up a series of old-world\r\nplays for 'em. Their voices will make you laugh and cry. My God, dear\r\nmen, where _do_ you suppose they picked up all their misery from, on\r\nthis sweet earth? I'll have a pageant of the world's beginnings, and\r\nMosenthal shall do the music. I'll--'\r\n\r\n'Go and knock up a village for 'em by to-night. We'll meet you at No. 15\r\nWest Landing Tower,' said De Forest. 'Remember the rest will be coming\r\nalong to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'Let 'em all come!' said Vincent. 'You don't know how hard it is\r\nnowadays even for me, to find something that really gets under the\r\npublic's damned iridium-plated hide. But I've got it at last. Good-bye!'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said De Forest when we had finished laughing, 'if any one\r\nunderstood corruption in London I might have played off Vincent against\r\nGerolstein, and sold my captives at enormous prices. As it is, I shall\r\nhave to be their legal adviser to-night when the contracts are signed.\r\nAnd they won't exactly press any commission on me, either.'\r\n\r\n'Meantime,' said Takahira, 'we cannot, of course, confine members of\r\nLeopold Vincent's last-engaged company. Chairs for the ladies,\r\nplease, Arnott.'\r\n\r\n'Then I go to bed,' said De Forest. 'I can't face any more women!' And\r\nhe vanished.\r\n\r\nWhen our passengers were released and given another meal (finger-bowls\r\ncame first this time) they told us what they thought of us and the\r\nBoard; and, like Vincent, we all marvelled how they had contrived to\r\nextract and secrete so much bitter poison and unrest out of the good\r\nlife God gives us. They raged, they stormed, they palpitated, flushed\r\nand exhausted their poor, torn nerves, panted themselves into silence,\r\nand renewed the senseless, shameless attacks.\r\n\r\n'But can't you understand,' said Pirolo pathetically to a shrieking\r\nwoman, 'that if we'd left you in Chicago you'd have been killed?'\r\n\r\n'No, we shouldn't. You were bound to save us from being murdered.'\r\n\r\n'Then we should have had to kill a lot of other people.'\r\n\r\n'That doesn't matter. We were preaching the Truth. You can't stop us. We\r\nshall go on preaching in London; and _then_ you'll see!'\r\n\r\n'You can see now,' said Pirolo, and opened a lower shutter.\r\n\r\nWe were closing on the Little Village, with her three million people\r\nspread out at ease inside her ring of girdling Main-Traffic\r\nlights--those eight fixed beams at Chatham, Tonbridge, Redhill, Dorking,\r\nWoking, St. Albans, Chipping Ongar, and Southend.\r\n\r\nLeopold Vincent's new company looked, with small pale faces, at the\r\nsilence, the size, and the separated houses.\r\n\r\nThen some began to weep aloud, shamelessly--always without shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     MACDONOUGH'S SONG\r\n\r\n     Whether the State can loose and bind\r\n       In Heaven as well as on Earth:\r\n     If it be wiser to kill mankind\r\n       Before or after the birth--\r\n     These are matters of high concern\r\n       Where State-kept schoolmen are;\r\n     But Holy State (we have lived to learn)\r\n       Endeth in Holy War.\r\n\r\n     Whether The People be led by the Lord,\r\n       Or lured by the loudest throat:\r\n     If it be quicker to die by the sword\r\n       Or cheaper to die by vote--\r\n     These are the things we have dealt with once,\r\n       (And they will not rise from their grave)\r\n     For Holy People, however it runs,\r\n       Endeth in wholly Slave.\r\n\r\n     Whatsoever, for any cause,\r\n       Seeketh to take or give,\r\n     Power above or beyond the Laws,\r\n       Suffer it not to live!\r\n     Holy State or Holy King--\r\n       Or Holy People's Will--\r\n     Have no truck with the senseless thing.\r\n       Order the guns and kill!\r\n         _Saying--after--me:--_\r\n\r\n     _Once there was The People--Terror gave it birth;\r\n     Once there was The People and it made a Hell of Earth.\r\n     Earth arose and crushed it. Listen, O ye slain!\r\n     Once there was The People--it shall never be again!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFriendly Brook\r\n\r\n(March 1914)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe valley was so choked with fog that one could scarcely see a cow's\r\nlength across a field. Every blade, twig, bracken-frond, and hoof-print\r\ncarried water, and the air was filled with the noise of rushing ditches\r\nand field-drains, all delivering to the brook below. A week's November\r\nrain on water-logged land had gorged her to full flood, and she\r\nproclaimed it aloud.\r\n\r\nTwo men in sackcloth aprons were considering an untrimmed hedge that ran\r\ndown the hillside and disappeared into mist beside those roarings. They\r\nstood back and took stock of the neglected growth, tapped an elbow of\r\nhedge-oak here, a mossed beech-stub there, swayed a stooled ash back and\r\nforth, and looked at each other.\r\n\r\n'I reckon she's about two rod thick,' said Jabez the younger, 'an' she\r\nhasn't felt iron since--when has she, Jesse?'\r\n\r\n'Call it twenty-five year, Jabez, an' you won't be far out.'\r\n\r\n'Umm!' Jabez rubbed his wet handbill on his wetter coat-sleeve. 'She\r\nain't a hedge. She's all manner o' trees. We'll just about have to--' He\r\npaused, as professional etiquette required.\r\n\r\n'Just about have to side her up an' see what she'll bear. But hadn't we\r\nbest--?' Jesse paused in his turn, both men being artists and equals.\r\n\r\n'Get some kind o' line to go by.' Jabez ranged up and down till he found\r\na thinner place, and with clean snicks of the handbill revealed the\r\noriginal face of the fence. Jesse took over the dripping stuff as it\r\nfell forward, and, with a grasp and a kick, made it to lie orderly on\r\nthe bank till it should be faggoted.\r\n\r\nBy noon a length of unclean jungle had turned itself into a cattle-proof\r\nbarrier, tufted here and there with little plumes of the sacred holly\r\nwhich no woodman touches without orders.\r\n\r\n'Now we've a witness-board to go by!' said Jesse at last.\r\n\r\n'She won't be as easy as this all along,' Jabez answered. 'She'll need\r\nplenty stakes and binders when we come to the brook.'\r\n\r\n'Well, ain't we plenty?' Jesse pointed to the ragged perspective ahead\r\nof them that plunged downhill into the fog. 'I lay there's a cord an' a\r\nhalf o' firewood, let alone faggots, 'fore we get anywheres anigh\r\nthe brook.'\r\n\r\n'The brook's got up a piece since morning,' said Jabez. 'Sounds like's\r\nif she was over Wickenden's door-stones.'\r\n\r\nJesse listened, too. There was a growl in the brook's roar as though she\r\nworried something hard.\r\n\r\n'Yes. She's over Wickenden's door-stones,' he replied. 'Now she'll flood\r\nacrost Alder Bay an' that'll ease her.'\r\n\r\n'She won't ease Jim Wickenden's hay none if she do,' Jabez grunted. 'I\r\ntold Jim he'd set that liddle hay-stack o' his too low down in the\r\nmedder. I _told_ him so when he was drawin' the bottom for it.'\r\n\r\n'I told him so, too,' said Jesse. 'I told him 'fore ever you did. I told\r\nhim when the County Council tarred the roads up along.' He pointed\r\nuphill, where unseen automobiles and road-engines droned past\r\ncontinually. 'A tarred road, she shoots every drop o' water into a\r\nvalley same's a slate roof. 'Tisn't as 'twas in the old days, when the\r\nwaters soaked in and soaked out in the way o' nature. It rooshes off\r\nthey tarred roads all of a lump, and naturally every drop is bound to\r\ndescend into the valley. And there's tar roads both two sides this\r\nvalley for ten mile. That's what I told Jim Wickenden when they tarred\r\nthe roads last year. But he's a valley-man. He don't hardly ever\r\njourney uphill.'\r\n\r\n'What did he say when you told him that?' Jabez demanded, with a little\r\nchange of voice.\r\n\r\n'Why? What did he say to you when _you_ told him?' was the answer.\r\n\r\n'What he said to you, I reckon, Jesse.'\r\n\r\n'Then, you don't need me to say it over again, Jabez.'\r\n\r\n'Well, let be how 'twill, what was he gettin' _after_ when he said what\r\nhe said to me?' Jabez insisted.\r\n\r\n'I dunno; unless you tell me what manner o' words he said to _you_.'\r\n\r\nJabez drew back from the hedge--all hedges are nests of treachery and\r\neavesdropping--and moved to an open cattle-lodge in the centre of\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n'No need to go ferretin' around,' said Jesse. 'None can't see us here\r\n'fore we see them.'\r\n\r\n'What was Jim Wickenden gettin' at when I said he'd set his stack too\r\nnear anigh the brook?' Jabez dropped his voice. 'He was in his mind.'\r\n\r\n'He ain't never been out of it yet to my knowledge,' Jesse drawled, and\r\nuncorked his tea-bottle.\r\n\r\n'But then Jim says: \"I ain't goin' to shift my stack a yard,\" he says.\r\n\"The Brook's been good friends to me, and if she be minded,\" he says,\r\n\"to take a snatch at my hay, I ain't settin' out to withstand her.\"\r\nThat's what Jim Wickenden says to me last--last June-end 'twas,'\r\nsaid Jabez.\r\n\r\n'Nor he hasn't shifted his stack, neither,' Jesse replied. 'An' if\r\nthere's more rain, the brook she'll shift it for him.'\r\n\r\n'No need tell _me_! But I want to know what Jim was gettin' _at_?'\r\n\r\nJabez opened his clasp-knife very deliberately; Jesse as carefully\r\nopened his. They unfolded the newspapers that wrapped their dinners,\r\ncoiled away and pocketed the string that bound the packages, and sat\r\ndown on the edge of the lodge manger. The rain began to fall again\r\nthrough the fog, and the brook's voice rose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'But I always allowed Mary was his lawful child, like,' said Jabez,\r\nafter Jesse had spoken for a while.\r\n\r\n''Tain't so.... Jim Wickenden's woman she never made nothing. She come\r\nout o' Lewes with her stockin's round her heels, an' she never made nor\r\nmended aught till she died. _He_ had to light fire an' get breakfast\r\nevery mornin' except Sundays, while she sowed it abed. Then she took an'\r\ndied, sixteen, seventeen, year back; but she never had no childern.'\r\n\r\n'They was valley-folk,' said Jabez apologetically. 'I'd no call to go in\r\namong 'em, but I always allowed Mary--'\r\n\r\n'No. Mary come out o' one o' those Lunnon Childern Societies. After his\r\nwoman died, Jim got his mother back from his sister over to Peasmarsh,\r\nwhich she'd gone to house with when Jim married. His mother kept house\r\nfor Jim after his woman died. They do say 'twas his mother led him on\r\ntoward adoptin' of Mary--to furnish out the house with a child, like,\r\nand to keep him off of gettin' a noo woman. He mostly done what his\r\nmother contrived. 'Cardenly, twixt 'em, they asked for a child from one\r\no' those Lunnon societies--same as it might ha' been these Barnardo\r\nchildren--an' Mary was sent down to 'em, in a candle-box, I've heard.'\r\n\r\n'Then Mary is chance-born. I never knowed that,' said Jabez. 'Yet I must\r\nha' heard it some time or other ...'\r\n\r\n'No. She ain't. 'Twould ha' been better for some folk if she had been.\r\nShe come to Jim in a candle-box with all the proper papers--lawful child\r\no' some couple in Lunnon somewheres--mother dead, father drinkin'.\r\n_And_ there was that Lunnon society's five shillin's a week for her.\r\nJim's mother she wouldn't despise week-end money, but I never heard Jim\r\nwas much of a muck-grubber. Let be how 'twill, they two mothered up Mary\r\nno bounds, till it looked at last like they'd forgot she wasn't their\r\nown flesh an' blood. Yes, I reckon they forgot Mary wasn't their'n\r\nby rights.'\r\n\r\n'That's no new thing,' said Jabez. 'There's more'n one or two in this\r\nparish wouldn't surrender back their Bernarders. You ask Mark Copley an'\r\nhis woman an' that Bernarder cripple-babe o' theirs.'\r\n\r\n'Maybe they need the five shillin',' Jesse suggested.\r\n\r\n'It's handy,' said Jabez. 'But the child's more. \"Dada\" he says, an'\r\n\"Mumma\" he says, with his great rollin' head-piece all hurdled up in\r\nthat iron collar. _He_ won't live long--his backbone's rotten, like. But\r\nthey Copleys do just about set store by him--five bob or no five bob.'\r\n\r\n'Same way with Jim an' his mother,' Jesse went on. 'There was talk\r\nbetwixt 'em after a few years o' not takin' any more week-end money for\r\nMary; but let alone _she_ never passed a farden in the mire 'thout\r\nlongin's, Jim didn't care, like, to push himself forward into the\r\nSociety's remembrance. So naun came of it. The week-end money would ha'\r\nmade no odds to Jim--not after his uncle willed him they four cottages\r\nat Eastbourne _an'_ money in the bank.'\r\n\r\n'That was true, too, then? I heard something in a scadderin'\r\nword-o'-mouth way,' said Jabez.\r\n\r\n'I'll answer for the house property, because Jim he requested my signed\r\nname at the foot o' some papers concernin' it. Regardin' the money in\r\nthe bank, he nature-ally wouldn't like such things talked about all\r\nround the parish, so he took strangers for witnesses.'\r\n\r\n'Then 'twill make Mary worth seekin' after?'\r\n\r\n'She'll need it. Her Maker ain't done much for her outside nor yet in.'\r\n\r\n'That ain't no odds.' Jabez shook his head till the water showered off\r\nhis hat-brim. 'If Mary has money, she'll be wed before any likely pore\r\nmaid. She's cause to be grateful to Jim.'\r\n\r\n'She hides it middlin' close, then,' said Jesse. 'It don't sometimes\r\nlook to me as if Mary has her natural rightful feelin's. She don't put\r\non an apron o' Mondays 'thout being druv to it--in the kitchen _or_ the\r\nhen-house. She's studyin' to be a school-teacher. She'll make a beauty!\r\nI never knowed her show any sort o' kindness to nobody--not even when\r\nJim's mother was took dumb. No! 'Twadn't no stroke. It stifled the old\r\nlady in the throat here. First she couldn't shape her words no shape;\r\nthen she clucked, like, an' lastly she couldn't more than suck down\r\nspoon-meat an' hold her peace. Jim took her to Doctor Harding, an'\r\nHarding he bundled her off to Brighton Hospital on a ticket, but they\r\ncouldn't make no stay to her afflictions there; and she was bundled off\r\nto Lunnon, an' they lit a great old lamp inside her, and Jim told me\r\nthey couldn't make out nothing in no sort there; and, along o' one thing\r\nan' another, an' all their spyin's and pryin's, she come back a hem\r\nsight worse than when she started. Jim said he'd have no more\r\nhospitalizin', so he give her a slate, which she tied to her\r\nwaist-string, and what she was minded to say she writ on it.'\r\n\r\n'Now, I never knowed that! But they're valley-folk,' Jabez repeated.\r\n\r\n''Twadn't particular noticeable, for she wasn't a talkin' woman any time\r\no' her days. Mary had all three's tongue.... Well, then, two years this\r\nsummer, come what I'm tellin' you. Mary's Lunnon father, which they'd\r\nput clean out o' their minds, arrived down from Lunnon with the law on\r\nhis side, sayin' he'd take his daughter back to Lunnon, after all. I was\r\nworking for Mus' Dockett at Pounds Farm that summer, but I was obligin'\r\nJim that evenin' muckin' out his pig-pen. I seed a stranger come\r\ntraipsin' over the bridge agin' Wickenden's door-stones. 'Twadn't the\r\nnew County Council bridge with the handrail. They hadn't given it in for\r\na public right o' way then. 'Twas just a bit o' lathy old plank which\r\nJim had throwed acrost the brook for his own conveniences. The man\r\nwasn't drunk--only a little concerned in liquor, like--an' his back was\r\na mask where he'd slipped in the muck comin' along. He went up the\r\nbricks past Jim's mother, which was feedin' the ducks, an' set himself\r\ndown at the table inside--Jim was just changin' his socks--an' the man\r\nlet Jim know all his rights and aims regardin' Mary. Then there just\r\nabout _was_ a hurly-bulloo? Jim's fust mind was to pitch him forth, but\r\nhe'd done that once in his young days, and got six months up to Lewes\r\njail along o' the man fallin' on his head. So he swallowed his spittle\r\nan' let him talk. The law about Mary _was_ on the man's side from fust\r\nto last, for he showed us all the papers. Then Mary come\r\ndownstairs--she'd been studyin' for an examination--an' the man tells\r\nher who he was, an' she says he had ought to have took proper care of\r\nhis own flesh and blood while he had it by him, an' not to think he\r\ncould ree-claim it when it suited. He says somethin' or other, but she\r\nlooks him up an' down, front an' backwent, an' she just tongues him\r\nscadderin' out o' doors, and he went away stuffin' all the papers back\r\ninto his hat, talkin' most abusefully. Then she come back an' freed her\r\nmind against Jim an' his mother for not havin' warned her of her\r\nupbringin's, which it come out she hadn't ever been told. They didn't\r\nsay naun to her. They never did. _I'd_ ha' packed her off with any man\r\nthat would ha' took her--an' God's pity on him!'\r\n\r\n'Umm!' said Jabez, and sucked his pipe.\r\n\r\n'So then, that was the beginnin.' The man come back again next week or\r\nso, an' he catched Jim alone, 'thout his mother this time, an' he fair\r\nbeazled him with his papers an' his talk--for the law _was_ on his\r\nside--till Jim went down into his money-purse an' give him ten shillings\r\nhush-money--he told me--to withdraw away for a bit an' leave Mary\r\nwith 'em.'\r\n\r\n'But that's no way to get rid o' man or woman,' Jabez said.\r\n\r\n'No more 'tis. I told Jim so. \"What can I do?\" Jim says. \"The law's\r\n_with_ the man. I walk about daytimes thinkin' o' it till I sweats my\r\nunderclothes wringin', an' I lie abed nights thinkin' o' it till I\r\nsweats my sheets all of a sop. 'Tisn't as if I was a young man,\" he\r\nsays, \"nor yet as if I was a pore man. Maybe he'll drink hisself to\r\ndeath.\" I e'en a'most told him outright what foolishness he was enterin'\r\ninto, but he knowed it--he knowed it--because he said next time the man\r\ncome 'twould be fifteen shillin's. An' next time 'twas. Just fifteen\r\nshillin's!'\r\n\r\n'An' _was_ the man her father?' asked Jabez.\r\n\r\n'He had the proofs an' the papers. Jim showed me what that Lunnon\r\nChildern's Society had answered when Mary writ up to 'em an' taxed 'em\r\nwith it. I lay she hadn't been proper polite in her letters to 'em, for\r\nthey answered middlin' short. They said the matter was out o' their\r\nhands, but--let's see if I remember--oh, yes,--they ree-gretted there\r\nhad been an oversight. I reckon they had sent Mary out in the candle-box\r\nas a orphan instead o' havin' a father. Terrible awkward! Then, when\r\nhe'd drinked up the money, the man come again--in his usuals--an' he\r\nkept hammerin' on and hammerin' on about his duty to his pore dear wife,\r\nan' what he'd do for his dear daughter in Lunnon, till the tears runned\r\ndown his two dirty cheeks an' he come away with more money. Jim used to\r\nslip it into his hand behind the door; but his mother she heard the\r\nchink. She didn't hold with hush-money. She'd write out all her feelin's\r\non the slate, an' Jim 'ud be settin' up half the night answerin' back\r\nan' showing that the man had the law with him.'\r\n\r\n'Hadn't that man no trade nor business, then?'\r\n\r\n'He told me he was a printer. I reckon, though, he lived on the rates\r\nlike the rest of 'em up there in Lunnon.'\r\n\r\n'An' how did Mary take it?'\r\n\r\n'She said she'd sooner go into service than go with the man. I reckon a\r\nmistress 'ud be middlin' put to it for a maid 'fore she put Mary into\r\ncap an' gown. She was studyin' to be a schoo-ool-teacher. A beauty\r\nshe'll make!... Well, that was how things went that fall. Mary's Lunnon\r\nfather kep' comin' an' comin' 'carden as he'd drinked out the money Jim\r\ngave him; an' each time he'd put-up his price for not takin' Mary away.\r\nJim's mother, she didn't like partin' with no money, an' bein' obliged\r\nto write her feelin's on the slate instead o' givin' 'em vent by mouth,\r\nshe was just about mad. Just about she _was_ mad!\r\n\r\n'Come November, I lodged with Jim in the outside room over 'gainst his\r\nhen-house. I paid _her_ my rent. I was workin' for Dockett at\r\nPounds--gettin' chestnut-bats out o' Perry Shaw. Just such weather as\r\nthis be--rain atop o' rain after a wet October. (An' I remember it ended\r\nin dry frostes right away up to Christmas.) Dockett he'd sent up to\r\nPerry Shaw for me--no, he comes puffin' up to me himself--because a big\r\ncorner-piece o' the bank had slipped into the brook where she makes that\r\nelber at the bottom o' the Seventeen Acre, an' all the rubbishy alders\r\nan' sallies which he ought to have cut out when he took the farm,\r\nthey'd slipped with the slip, an' the brook was comin' rooshin' down\r\natop of 'em, an' they'd just about back an' spill the waters over his\r\nwinter wheat. The water was lyin' in the flats already. \"Gor a-mighty,\r\nJesse!\" he bellers out at me, \"get that rubbish away all manners you\r\ncan. Don't stop for no fagottin', but give the brook play or my wheat's\r\npast salvation. I can't lend you no help,\" he says, \"but work an'\r\nI'll pay ye.\"'\r\n\r\n'You had him there,' Jabez chuckled.\r\n\r\n'Yes. I reckon I had ought to have drove my bargain, but the brook was\r\nbackin' up on good bread-corn. So 'cardenly, I laid into the mess of it,\r\nworkin' off the bank where the trees was drownin' themselves head-down\r\nin the roosh--just such weather as this--an' the brook creepin' up on me\r\nall the time. 'Long toward noon, Jim comes mowchin' along with his\r\ntoppin' axe over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n'\"Be you minded for an extra hand at your job?\" he says.\r\n\r\n'\"Be you minded to turn to?\" I ses, an'--no more talk to it--Jim laid in\r\nalongside o' me. He's no hunger with a toppin' axe.'\r\n\r\n'Maybe, but I've seed him at a job o' throwin' in the woods, an' he\r\ndidn't seem to make out no shape,' said Jabez. 'He haven't got the\r\nshoulders, nor yet the judgment--_my_ opinion--when he's dealin' with\r\nfull-girt timber. He don't rightly make up his mind where he's goin' to\r\nthrow her.'\r\n\r\n'We wasn't throwin' nothin'. We was cuttin' out they soft alders, an'\r\nhaulin' 'em up the bank 'fore they could back the waters on the wheat.\r\nJim didn't say much, 'less it was that he'd had a postcard from Mary's\r\nLunnon father, night before, sayin' he was comin' down that mornin'.\r\nJim, he'd sweated all night, an' he didn't reckon hisself equal to the\r\ntalkin' an' the swearin' an' the cryin', an' his mother blamin' him\r\nafterwards on the slate. \"It spiled my day to think of it,\" he ses, when\r\nwe was eatin' our pieces. \"So I've fair cried dunghill an' run.\r\nMother'll have to tackle him by herself. I lay _she_ won't give him no\r\nhush-money,\" he ses. \"I lay he'll be surprised by the time he's done\r\nwith _her_,\" he ses. An' that was e'en a'most all the talk we had\r\nconcernin' it. But he's no hunger with the toppin' axe.\r\n\r\n'The brook she'd crep' up an' up on us, an' she kep' creepin' upon us\r\ntill we was workin' knee-deep in the shallers, cuttin' an' pookin' an'\r\npullin' what we could get to o' the rubbish. There was a middlin' lot\r\ncomin' down-stream, too--cattle-bars, an' hop-poles and odds-ends bats,\r\nall poltin' down together; but they rooshed round the elber good shape\r\nby the time we'd backed out they drowned trees. Come four o'clock we\r\nreckoned we'd done a proper day's work, an' she'd take no harm if we\r\nleft her. We couldn't puddle about there in the dark an' wet to no more\r\nadvantage. Jim he was pourin' the water out of his boots--no, I was\r\ndoin' that. Jim was kneelin' to unlace his'n. \"Damn it all, Jesse,\" he\r\nses, standin' up; \"the flood must be over my doorsteps at home, for here\r\ncomes my old white-top bee-skep!\"'\r\n\r\n'Yes. I allus heard he paints his bee-skeps,' Jabez put in. 'I dunno\r\npaint don't tarrify bees more'n it keeps em' dry.'\r\n\r\n'\"I'll have a pook at it,\" he ses, an' he pooks at it as it comes round\r\nthe elber. The roosh nigh jerked the pooker out of his hand-grips, an'\r\nhe calls to me, an' I come runnin' barefoot. Then we pulled on the\r\npooker, an' it reared up on eend in the roosh, an' we guessed what\r\n'twas. 'Cardenly we pulled it in into a shaller, an' it rolled a piece,\r\nan' a great old stiff man's arm nigh hit me in the face. Then we was\r\nsure. \"'Tis a man,\" ses Jim. But the face was all a mask. \"I reckon it's\r\nMary's Lunnon father,\" he ses presently. \"Lend me a match and I'll make\r\nsure.\" He never used baccy. We lit three matches one by another, well's\r\nwe could in the rain, an' he cleaned off some o' the slob with a tussick\r\no' grass. \"Yes,\" he ses. \"It's Mary's Lunnon father. He won't tarrify us\r\nno more. D'you want him, Jesse?\" he ses.\r\n\r\n'\"No,\" I ses. \"If this was Eastbourne beach like, he'd be half-a-crown\r\napiece to us 'fore the coroner; but now we'd only lose a day havin' to\r\n'tend the inquest. I lay he fell into the brook.\"\r\n\r\n'\"I lay he did,\" ses Jim. \"I wonder if he saw mother.\" He turns him\r\nover, an' opens his coat and puts his fingers in the waistcoat pocket\r\nan' starts laughin'. \"He's seen mother, right enough,\" he ses. \"An' he's\r\ngot the best of her, too. _She_ won't be able to crow no more over _me_\r\n'bout givin' him money. _I_ never give him more than a sovereign. She's\r\ngive him two!\" an' he trousers 'em, laughin' all the time. \"An' now\r\nwe'll pook him back again, for I've done with him,\" he ses.\r\n\r\n'So we pooked him back into the middle of the brook, an' we saw he went\r\nround the elber 'thout balkin', an' we walked quite a piece beside of\r\nhim to set him on his ways. When we couldn't see no more, we went home\r\nby the high road, because we knowed the brook 'u'd be out acrost the\r\nmedders, an' we wasn't goin' to hunt for Jim's little rotten old bridge\r\nin that dark--an' rainin' Heavens' hard, too. I was middlin' pleased to\r\nsee light an' vittles again when we got home. Jim he pressed me to come\r\ninsides for a drink. He don't drink in a generality, but he was rid of\r\nall his troubles that evenin', d'ye see? \"Mother,\" he ses so soon as the\r\ndoor ope'd, \"have you seen him?\" She whips out her slate an' writes\r\ndown--\"No.\" \"Oh, no,\" ses Jim. \"You don't get out of it that way,\r\nmother. I lay you _have_ seen him, an' I lay he's bested you for all\r\nyour talk, same as he bested me. Make a clean breast of it, mother,\" he\r\nses. \"He got round you too.\" She was goin' for the slate again, but he\r\nstops her. \"It's all right, mother,\" he ses. \"I've seen him sense you\r\nhave, an' he won't trouble us no more.\" The old lady looks up quick as a\r\nrobin, an' she writes, \"Did he say so?\" \"No,\" ses Jim, laughin'. \"He\r\ndidn't say so. That's how I know. But he bested _you_, mother. You can't\r\nhave it in at _me_ for bein' soft-hearted. You're twice as\r\ntender-hearted as what I be. Look!\" he ses, an' he shows her the two\r\nsovereigns. \"Put 'em away where they belong,\" he ses. \"He won't never\r\ncome for no more; an' now we'll have our drink,\" he ses, \"for we've\r\nearned it.\"\r\n\r\n'Nature-ally they weren't goin' to let me see where they kep' their\r\nmonies. She went upstairs with it--for the whisky.'\r\n\r\n'I never knowed Jim was a drinkin' man--in his own house, like,' said\r\nJabez.\r\n\r\n'No more he isn't; but what he takes he likes good. He won't tech no\r\npublican's hogwash acrost the bar. Four shillin's he paid for that\r\nbottle o' whisky. I know, because when the old lady brought it down\r\nthere wasn't more'n jest a liddle few dreenin's an' dregs in it. Nothin'\r\nto set before neighbours, I do assure you.'\r\n\r\n'\"Why, 'twas half full last week, mother,\" he ses. \"You don't mean,\" he\r\nses, \"you've given him all that as well? It's two shillin's worth,\" he\r\nses. (That's how I knowed he paid four.) \"Well, well, mother, you be too\r\ntender-'carted to live. But I don't grudge it to him,\" he ses. \"I don't\r\ngrudge him nothin' he can keep.\" So, 'cardenly, we drinked up what\r\nlittle sup was left.'\r\n\r\n'An' what come to Mary's Lunnon father?' said Jabez after a full\r\nminute's silence.\r\n\r\n'I be too tired to go readin' papers of evenin's; but Dockett he told\r\nme, that very week, I think, that they'd inquested on a man down at\r\nRobertsbridge which had poked and poked up agin' so many bridges an'\r\nbanks, like, they couldn't make naun out of him.'\r\n\r\n'An' what did Mary say to all these doin's?'\r\n\r\n'The old lady bundled her off to the village 'fore her Lunnon father\r\ncome, to buy week-end stuff (an' she forgot the half o' it). When we\r\ncome in she was upstairs studyin' to be a school-teacher. None told her\r\nnaun about it. 'Twadn't girls' affairs.'\r\n\r\n'Reckon _she_ knowed?' Jabez went on.\r\n\r\n'She? She must have guessed it middlin' close when she saw her money\r\ncome back. But she never mentioned it in writing so far's I know. She\r\nwere more worritted that night on account of two-three her chickens\r\nbein' drowned, for the flood had skewed their old hen-house round on her\r\npostes. I cobbled her up next mornin' when the brook shrinked.'\r\n\r\n'An' where did you find the bridge? Some fur down-stream, didn't ye?'\r\n\r\n'Just where she allus was. She hadn't shifted but very little. The brook\r\nhad gulled out the bank a piece under one eend o' the plank, so's she\r\nwas liable to tilt ye sideways if you wasn't careful. But I pooked\r\nthree-four bricks under her, an' she was all plumb again.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I dunno how it _looks_ like, but let be how 'twill,' said Jabez,\r\n'he hadn't no business to come down from Lunnon tarrifyin' people, an'\r\nthreatenin' to take away children which they'd hobbed up for their\r\nlawful own--even if 'twas Mary Wickenden.'\r\n\r\n'He had the business right enough, an' he had the law with him--no\r\ngettin' over that,' said Jesse. 'But he had the drink with him, too, an'\r\nthat was where he failed, like.'\r\n\r\n'Well, well! Let be how 'twill, the brook was a good friend to Jim. I\r\nsee it now. I allus _did_ wonder what he was gettin' at when he said\r\nthat, when I talked to him about shiftin' the stack. \"You dunno\r\neverythin',\" he ses. \"The Brook's been a good friend to me,\" he ses,\r\n\"an' if she's minded to have a snatch at my hay, _I_ ain't settin' out\r\nto withstand her.\"'\r\n\r\n'I reckon she's about shifted it, too, by now,' Jesse chuckled. 'Hark!\r\nThat ain't any slip off the bank which she's got hold of.'\r\n\r\nThe Brook had changed her note again. It sounded as though she were\r\nmumbling something soft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE LAND\r\n\r\n     When Julius Fabricius, Sub-Prefect of the Weald,\r\n     In the days of Diocletian owned our Lower River-field,\r\n     He called to him Hobdenius--a Briton of the Clay,\r\n     Saying: 'What about that River-piece for layin' in to hay?'\r\n\r\n     And the aged Hobden answered: 'I remember as a lad\r\n     My father told your father that she wanted dreenin' bad.\r\n     An' the more that you neeglect her the less you'll get her clean.\r\n     Have it jest _as_ you've a mind to, but, if I was you, I'd dreen.'\r\n\r\n     So they drained it long and crossways in the lavish Roman style.\r\n     Still we find among the river-drift their flakes of ancient tile,\r\n     And in drouthy middle August, when the bones of meadows show,\r\n     We can trace the lines they followed sixteen hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n     Then Julius Fabricius died as even Prefects do,\r\n     And after certain centuries, Imperial Rome died too.\r\n     Then did robbers enter Britain from across the Northern main\r\n     And our Lower River-field was won by Ogier the Dane.\r\n\r\n     Well could Ogier work his war-boat--well could Ogier wield\r\n          his brand--\r\n     Much he knew of foaming waters--not so much of farming land.\r\n     So he called to him a Hobden of the old unaltered blood.\r\n     Saying: 'What about that River-bit, she doesn't look no good?'\r\n\r\n     And that aged Hobden answered: ''Tain't for _me_ to interfere,\r\n     But I've known that bit o' meadow now for five and fifty year.\r\n     Have it _jest_ as you've a mind to, but I've proved it time\r\n          on time,\r\n     If you want to change her nature you have _got_ to give her lime!'\r\n\r\n     Ogier sent his wains to Lewes, twenty hours' solemn walk,\r\n     And drew back great abundance of the cool, grey, healing chalk.\r\n     And old Hobden spread it broadcast, never heeding what was in't;\r\n     Which is why in cleaning ditches, now and then we find a flint.\r\n\r\n     Ogier died. His sons grew English. Anglo-Saxon was their name,\r\n     Till out of blossomed Normandy another pirate came;\r\n     For Duke William conquered England and divided with his men,\r\n     And our Lower River-field he gave to William of Warenne.\r\n\r\n     But the Brook (you know her habit) rose one rainy Autumn night\r\n     And tore down sodden flitches of the bank to left and right.\r\n     So, said William to his Bailiff as they rode their dripping rounds:\r\n     'Hob, what about that River-bit--the Brook's got up no bounds?'\r\n\r\n     And that aged Hobden answered: ''Tain't my business to advise,\r\n     But ye might ha' known 'twould happen from the way the valley lies.\r\n     When ye can't hold back the water you must try and save the sile.\r\n     Hev it jest as you've a _mind_ to, but, if I was you, I'd spile!'\r\n\r\n     They spiled along the water-course with trunks of willow-trees\r\n     And planks of elms behind 'em and immortal oaken knees.\r\n     And when the spates of Autumn whirl the gravel-beds away\r\n     You can see their faithful fragments iron-hard in iron clay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Georgii Quinti Anno Sexto_, I, who own the River-field,\r\n     Am fortified with title-deeds, attested, signed and sealed,\r\n     Guaranteeing me, my assigns, my executors and heirs\r\n     All sorts of powers and profits which--are neither mine nor theirs.\r\n\r\n     I have rights of chase and warren, as my dignity requires.\r\n     I can fish--but Hobden tickles. I can shoot--but Hobden wires.\r\n     I repair, but he reopens, certain gaps which, men allege,\r\n     Have been used by every Hobden since a Hobden swapped a hedge.\r\n\r\n     Shall I dog his morning progress o'er the track-betraying dew?\r\n     Demand his dinner-basket into which my pheasant flew?\r\n     Confiscate his evening faggot into which the conies ran,\r\n     And summons him to judgment? I would sooner summons Pan.\r\n\r\n     His dead are in the churchyard--thirty generations laid.\r\n     Their names went down in Domesday Book when Domesday Book was made.\r\n     And the passion and the piety and prowess of his line\r\n     Have seeded, rooted, fruited in some land the Law calls mine.\r\n\r\n     Not for any beast that burrows, not for any bird that flies,\r\n     Would I lose his large sound council, miss his keen amending eyes.\r\n     He is bailiff, woodman, wheelwright, field-surveyor, engineer,\r\n     And if flagrantly a poacher--'tain't for me to interfere.\r\n\r\n     'Hob, what about that River-bit?' I turn to him again\r\n     With Fabricius and Ogier and William of Warenne.\r\n     'Hev it jest as you've a mind to, _but_'--and so he takes command.\r\n     For whoever pays the taxes old Mus' Hobden owns the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Same Boat\r\n\r\n(1911)\r\n\r\n'A throbbing vein,' said Dr. Gilbert soothingly, 'is the mother of\r\ndelusion.'\r\n\r\n'Then how do you account for my knowing when the thing is due?' Conroy's\r\nvoice rose almost to a break.\r\n\r\n'Of course, but you should have consulted a doctor before\r\nusing--palliatives.'\r\n\r\n'It was driving me mad. And now I can't give them up.'\r\n\r\n''Not so bad as that! One doesn't form fatal habits at twenty-five.\r\nThink again. Were you ever frightened as a child?'\r\n\r\n'I don't remember. It began when I was a boy.'\r\n\r\n'With or without the spasm? By the way, do you mind describing the spasm\r\nagain?'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Conroy, twisting in the chair, 'I'm no musician, but\r\nsuppose you were a violin-string--vibrating--and some one put his finger\r\non you? As if a finger were put on the naked soul! Awful!'\r\n\r\n'So's indigestion--so's nightmare--while it lasts.'\r\n\r\n'But the horror afterwards knocks me out for days. And the waiting for\r\nit ... and then this drug habit! It can't go on!' He shook as he spoke,\r\nand the chair creaked.\r\n\r\n'My dear fellow,' said the doctor, 'when you're older you'll know what\r\nburdens the best of us carry. A fox to every Spartan.'\r\n\r\n'That doesn't help _me_. I can't! I can't!' cried Conroy, and burst into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n'Don't apologise,' said Gilbert, when the paroxysm ended. 'I'm used to\r\npeople coming a little--unstuck in this room.'\r\n\r\n'It's those tabloids!' Conroy stamped his foot feebly as he blew his\r\nnose. 'They've knocked me out. I used to be fit once. Oh, I've tried\r\nexercise and everything. But--if one sits down for a minute when it's\r\ndue--even at four in the morning--it runs up behind one.'\r\n\r\n'Ye-es. Many things come in the quiet of the morning. You always know\r\nwhen the visitation is due?'\r\n\r\n'What would I give not to be sure!' he sobbed.\r\n\r\n'We'll put that aside for the moment. I'm thinking of a case where what\r\nwe'll call anæmia of the brain was masked (I don't say cured) by\r\nvibration. He couldn't sleep, or thought he couldn't, but a steamer\r\nvoyage and the thump of the screw--'\r\n\r\n'A steamer? After what I've told you!' Conroy almost shrieked. 'I'd\r\nsooner ...'\r\n\r\n'Of course _not_ a steamer in your case, but a long railway journey the\r\nnext time you think it will trouble you. It sounds absurd, but--'\r\n\r\n'I'd try anything. I nearly have,' Conroy sighed.\r\n\r\n'Nonsense! I've given you a tonic that will clear _that_ notion from\r\nyour head. Give the train a chance, and don't begin the journey by\r\nbucking yourself up with tabloids. Take them along, but hold them in\r\nreserve--in reserve.'\r\n\r\n'D'you think I've self-control enough, after what you've heard?' said\r\nConroy.\r\n\r\nDr. Gilbert smiled. 'Yes. After what I've seen,' he glanced round the\r\nroom, 'I have no hesitation in saying you have quite as much\r\nself-control as many other people. I'll write you later about your\r\njourney. Meantime, the tonic,' and he gave some general directions\r\nbefore Conroy left.\r\n\r\nAn hour later Dr. Gilbert hurried to the links, where the others of his\r\nregular week-end game awaited him. It was a rigid round, played as usual\r\nat the trot, for the tension of the week lay as heavy on the two King's\r\nCounsels and Sir John Chartres as on Gilbert. The lawyers were old\r\nenemies of the Admiralty Court, and Sir John of the frosty eyebrows and\r\nAbernethy manner was bracketed with, but before, Rutherford Gilbert\r\namong nerve-specialists.\r\n\r\nAt the Club-house afterwards the lawyers renewed their squabble over a\r\ntangled collision case, and the doctors as naturally compared\r\nprofessional matters.\r\n\r\n'Lies--all lies,' said Sir John, when Gilbert had told him Conroy's\r\ntrouble. '_Post hoc, propter hoc_. The man or woman who drugs is _ipso\r\nfacto_ a liar. You've no imagination.'\r\n\r\n''Pity you haven't a little--occasionally.'\r\n\r\n'I have believed a certain type of patient in my time. It's always the\r\nsame. For reasons not given in the consulting-room they take to the\r\ndrug. Certain symptoms follow. They will swear to you, and believe it,\r\nthat they took the drug to mask the symptoms. What does your man use?\r\nNajdolene? I thought so. I had practically the duplicate of your case\r\nlast Thursday. Same old Najdolene--same old lie.'\r\n\r\n'Tell me the symptoms, and I'll draw my own inferences, Johnnie.'\r\n\r\n'Symptoms! The girl was rank poisoned with Najdolene. Ramping, stamping\r\npossession. Gad, I thought she'd have the chandelier down.'\r\n\r\n'Mine came unstuck too, and he has the physique of a bull,' said\r\nGilbert. 'What delusions had yours?'\r\n\r\n'Faces--faces with mildew on them. In any other walk of life we'd call\r\nit the Horrors. She told me, of course, she took the drugs to mask the\r\nfaces. _Post hoc, propter hoc_ again. All liars!'\r\n\r\n'What's that?' said the senior K.C. quickly. 'Sounds professional.'\r\n\r\n'Go away! Not for you, Sandy.' Sir John turned a shoulder against him\r\nand walked with Gilbert in the chill evening.\r\n\r\nTo Conroy in his chambers came, one week later, this letter:\r\n\r\n     DEAR MR. CONROY--If your plan of a night's trip on the 17th\r\n     still holds good, and you have no particular destination in\r\n     view, you could do me a kindness. A Miss Henschil, in whom I\r\n     am interested, goes down to the West by the 10.8 from\r\n     Waterloo (Number 3 platform) on that night. She is not\r\n     exactly an invalid, but, like so many of us, a little shaken\r\n     in her nerves. Her maid, of course, accompanies her, but if I\r\n     knew you were in the same train it would be an additional\r\n     source of strength. Will you please write and let me know\r\n     whether the 10.8 from Waterloo, Number 3 platform, on the\r\n     17th, suits you, and I will meet you there? Don't forget my\r\n     caution, and keep up the tonic.--Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n     L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.\r\n\r\n'He knows I'm scarcely fit to look after myself,' was Conroy's thought.\r\n'And he wants me to look after a woman!'\r\n\r\nYet, at the end of half an hour's irresolution, he accepted.\r\n\r\nNow Conroy's trouble, which had lasted for years, was this:\r\n\r\nOn a certain night, while he lay between sleep and wake, he would be\r\novertaken by a long shuddering sigh, which he learned to know was the\r\nsign that his brain had once more conceived its horror, and in time--in\r\ndue time--would bring it forth.\r\n\r\nDrugs could so well veil that horror that it shuffled along no worse\r\nthan as a freezing dream in a procession of disorderly dreams; but over\r\nthe return of the event drugs had no control. Once that sigh had passed\r\nhis lips the thing was inevitable, and through the days granted before\r\nits rebirth he walked in torment. For the first two years he had striven\r\nto fend it off by distractions, but neither exercise nor drink availed.\r\nThen he had come to the tabloids of the excellent M. Najdol. These\r\nguarantee, on the label, 'Refreshing and absolutely natural sleep to the\r\nsoul-weary.' They are carried in a case with a spring which presses one\r\nscented tabloid to the end of the tube, whence it can be lipped off in\r\nstroking the moustache or adjusting the veil.\r\n\r\nThree years of M. Najdol's preparations do not fit a man for many\r\ncareers. His friends, who knew he did not drink, assumed that Conroy had\r\nstrained his heart through valiant outdoor exercises, and Conroy had\r\nwith some care invented an imaginary doctor, symptoms, and regimen,\r\nwhich he discussed with them and with his mother in Hereford. She\r\nmaintained that he would grow out of it, and recommended nux vomica.\r\n\r\nWhen at last Conroy faced a real doctor, it was, he hoped, to be saved\r\nfrom suicide by a strait-waistcoat. Yet Dr. Gilbert had but given him\r\nmore drugs--a tonic, for instance, that would couple railway\r\ncarnages--and had advised a night in the train. Not alone the horrors of\r\na railway journey (for which a man who dare keep no servant must e'en\r\npack, label, and address his own bag), but the necessity for holding\r\nhimself in hand before a stranger 'a little shaken in her nerves.'\r\n\r\nHe spent a long forenoon packing, because when he assembled and counted\r\nthings his mind slid off to the hours that remained of the day before\r\nhis night, and he found himself counting minutes aloud. At such times\r\nthe injustice of his fate would drive him to revolts which no servant\r\nshould witness, but on this evening Dr. Gilbert's tonic held him fairly\r\ncalm while he put up his patent razors.\r\n\r\nWaterloo Station shook him into real life. The change for his ticket\r\nneeded concentration, if only to prevent shillings and pence turning\r\ninto minutes at the booking-office; and he spoke quickly to a porter\r\nabout the disposition of his bag. The old 10.8 from Waterloo to the West\r\nwas an all-night caravan that halted, in the interests of the milk\r\ntraffic, at almost every station.\r\n\r\nDr. Gilbert stood by the door of the one composite corridor-coach; an\r\nolder and stouter man behind him. 'So glad you're here!' he cried. 'Let\r\nme get your ticket.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly not,' Conroy answered. 'I got it myself--long ago. My bag's\r\nin too,' he added proudly.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon. Miss Henschil's here. I'll introduce you.'\r\n\r\n'But--but,' he stammered--'think of the state I'm in. If anything\r\nhappens I shall collapse.'\r\n\r\n'Not you. You'd rise to the occasion like a bird. And as for the\r\nself-control you were talking of the other day'--Gilbert swung him\r\nround--'look!'\r\n\r\nA young man in an ulster over a silk-faced frock-coat stood by the\r\ncarriage window, weeping shamelessly.\r\n\r\n'Oh, but that's only drink,' Conroy said. 'I haven't had one of my--my\r\nthings since lunch.'\r\n\r\n'Excellent!' said Gilbert. 'I knew I could depend on you. Come along.\r\nWait for a minute, Chartres.'\r\n\r\nA tall woman, veiled, sat by the far window. She bowed her head as the\r\ndoctor murmured Conroy knew not what. Then he disappeared and the\r\ninspector came for tickets.\r\n\r\n'My maid--next compartment,' she said slowly.\r\n\r\nConroy showed his ticket, but in returning it to the sleeve-pocket of\r\nhis ulster the little silver Najdolene case slipped from his glove and\r\nfell to the floor. He snatched it up as the moving train flung him\r\ninto his seat.\r\n\r\n'How nice!' said the woman. She leisurely lifted her veil, unbottoned\r\nthe first button of her left glove, and pressed out from its palm a\r\nNajdolene-case.\r\n\r\n'Don't!' said Conroy, not realising he had spoken.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon.' The deep voice was measured, even, and low. Conroy\r\nknew what made it so.\r\n\r\n'I said \"don't\"! He wouldn't like you to do it!'\r\n\r\n'No, he would not.' She held the tube with its ever-presented tabloid\r\nbetween finger and thumb. 'But aren't you one of the--ah--\"soul-weary\"\r\ntoo?'\r\n\r\n'That's why. Oh, please don't! Not at first. I--I haven't had one since\r\nmorning. You--you'll set me off!'\r\n\r\n'You? Are you so far gone as that?'\r\n\r\nHe nodded, pressing his palms together. The train jolted through\r\nVauxhall points, and was welcomed with the clang of empty milk-cans\r\nfor the West.\r\n\r\nAfter long silence she lifted her great eyes, and, with an innocence\r\nthat would have deceived any sound man, asked Conroy to call her maid to\r\nbring her a forgotten book.\r\n\r\nConroy shook his head. 'No. Our sort can't read. Don't!'\r\n\r\n'Were you sent to watch me?' The voice never changed.\r\n\r\n'Me? I need a keeper myself much more--_this_ night of all!'\r\n\r\n'This night? Have you a night, then? They disbelieved _me_ when I told\r\nthem of mine.' She leaned back and laughed, always slowly. 'Aren't\r\ndoctors stu-upid? They don't know.'\r\n\r\nShe leaned her elbow on her knee, lifted her veil that had fallen, and,\r\nchin in hand, stared at him. He looked at her--till his eyes were\r\nblurred with tears.\r\n\r\n'Have I been there, think you?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Surely--surely,' Conroy answered, for he had well seen the fear and the\r\nhorror that lived behind the heavy-lidded eyes, the fine tracing on the\r\nbroad forehead, and the guard set about the desirable mouth.\r\n\r\n'Then--suppose we have one--just one apiece? I've gone without since\r\nthis afternoon.'\r\n\r\nHe put up his hand, and would have shouted, but his voice broke.\r\n\r\n'Don't! Can't you see that it helps me to help you to keep it off? Don't\r\nlet's both go down together.'\r\n\r\n'But I want one. It's a poor heart that never rejoices. Just one. It's\r\nmy night.'\r\n\r\n'It's mine--too. My sixty-fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh.' He shut his\r\nlips firmly against the tide of visualised numbers that threatened to\r\ncarry him along.\r\n\r\n'Ah, it's only my thirty-ninth.' She paused as he had done. 'I wonder if\r\nI shall last into the sixties.... Talk to me or I shall go crazy. You're\r\na man. You're the stronger vessel. Tell me when you went to pieces.'\r\n\r\n'One, two, three, four, five, six, seven--eight--I beg your pardon.'\r\n\r\n'Not in the least. I always pretend I've dropped a stitch of my\r\nknitting. I count the days till the last day, then the hours, then the\r\nminutes. Do you?'\r\n\r\n'I don't think I've done very much else for the last--' said Conroy,\r\nshivering, for the night was cold, with a chill he recognised.\r\n\r\n'Oh, how comforting to find some one who can talk sense! It's not always\r\nthe same date, is it?'\r\n\r\n'What difference would that make?' He unbuttoned his ulster with a jerk.\r\n'You're a sane woman. Can't you see the wicked--wicked--wicked' (dust\r\nflew from the padded arm-rest as he struck it) unfairness of it? What\r\nhave I done?'\r\n\r\nShe laid her large hand on his shoulder very firmly.\r\n\r\n'If you begin to think over that,' she said, 'you'll go to pieces and be\r\nashamed. Tell me yours, and I'll tell you mine. Only be quiet--be quiet,\r\nlad, or you'll set me off!' She made shift to soothe him, though her\r\nchin trembled.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said he at last, picking at the arm-rest between them, 'mine's\r\nnothing much, of course.'\r\n\r\n'Don't be a fool! That's for doctors--and mothers.'\r\n\r\n'It's Hell,' Conroy muttered. 'It begins on a steamer--on a stifling hot\r\nnight. I come out of my cabin. I pass through the saloon where the\r\nstewards have rolled up the carpets, and the boards are bare and hot\r\nand soapy.'\r\n\r\n'I've travelled too,' she said.\r\n\r\n'Ah! I come on deck. I walk down a covered alleyway. Butcher's meat,\r\nbananas, oil, that sort of smell.'\r\n\r\nAgain she nodded.\r\n\r\n'It's a lead-coloured steamer, and the sea's lead-coloured. Perfectly\r\nsmooth sea--perfectly still ship, except for the engines running, and\r\nher waves going off in lines and lines and lines--dull grey. All this\r\ntime I know something's going to happen.'\r\n\r\n'I know. Something going to happen,' she whispered.\r\n\r\n'Then I hear a thud in the engine-room. Then the noise of machinery\r\nfalling down--like fire-irons--and then two most awful yells. They're\r\nmore like hoots, and I know--I know while I listen--that it means that\r\ntwo men have died as they hooted. It was their last breath hooting out\r\nof them--in most awful pain. Do you understand?'\r\n\r\n'I ought to. Go on.'\r\n\r\n'That's the first part. Then I hear bare feet running along the\r\nalleyway. One of the scalded men comes up behind me and says quite\r\ndistinctly, \"My friend! All is lost!\" Then he taps me on the shoulder\r\nand I hear him drop down dead.' He panted and wiped his forehead.\r\n\r\n'So that is your night?' she said.\r\n\r\n'That is my night. It comes every few weeks--so many days after I get\r\nwhat I call sentence. Then I begin to count.'\r\n\r\n'Get sentence? D'you mean _this_?' She half closed her eyes, drew a\r\ndeep breath, and shuddered. '\"Notice\" I call it. Sir John thought it was\r\nall lies.'\r\n\r\nShe had unpinned her hat and thrown it on the seat opposite, showing the\r\nimmense mass of her black hair, rolled low in the nape of the columnar\r\nneck and looped over the left ear. But Conroy had no eyes except for her\r\ngrave eyes.\r\n\r\n'Listen now!' said she. 'I walk down a road, a white sandy road near the\r\nsea. There are broken fences on either side, and Men come and look at me\r\nover them.'\r\n\r\n'Just men? Do they speak?'\r\n\r\n'They try to. Their faces are all mildewy--eaten away,' and she hid her\r\nface for an instant with her left hand. 'It's the Faces--the Faces!'\r\n\r\n'Yes. Like my two hoots. I know.'\r\n\r\n'Ah! But the place itself--the bareness--and the glitter and the salt\r\nsmells, and the wind blowing the sand! The Men run after me and I\r\nrun.... I know what's coming too. One of them touches me.'\r\n\r\n'Yes! What comes then? We've both shirked that.'\r\n\r\n'One awful shock--not palpitation, but shock, shock, shock!'\r\n\r\n'As though your soul were being stopped--as you'd stop a finger-bowl\r\nhumming?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Just that,' she answered. 'One's very soul--the soul that one lives\r\nby--stopped. So!'\r\n\r\nShe drove her thumb deep into the arm-rest. 'And now,' she whined to\r\nhim, 'now that we've stirred each other up this way, mightn't we have\r\njust one?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Conroy, shaking. 'Let's hold on. We're past'--he peered out\r\nof the black windows--'Woking. There's the Necropolis. How long\r\ntill dawn?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, cruel long yet. If one dozes for a minute, it catches one.'\r\n\r\n'And how d'you find that this'--he tapped the palm of his glove--'helps\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'It covers up the thing from being too real--if one takes enough--you\r\nknow. Only--only--one loses everything else. I've been no more than a\r\nbogie-girl for two years. What would you give to be real again? This\r\nlying's such a nuisance.'\r\n\r\n'One must protect oneself--and there's one's mother to think of,' he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n'True. I hope allowances are made for us somewhere. Our burden--can you\r\nhear?--our burden is heavy enough.'\r\n\r\nShe rose, towering into the roof of the carriage. Conroy's ungentle grip\r\npulled her back.\r\n\r\n'Now _you_ are foolish. Sit down,' said he.\r\n\r\n'But the cruelty of it! Can't you see it? Don't you feel it? Let's take\r\none now--before I--'\r\n\r\n'Sit down!' cried Conroy, and the sweat stood again on his forehead. He\r\nhad fought through a few nights, and had been defeated on more, and he\r\nknew the rebellion that flares beyond control to exhaustion.\r\n\r\nShe smoothed her hair and dropped back, but for a while her head and\r\nthroat moved with the sickening motion of a captured wry-neck.\r\n\r\n'Once,' she said, spreading out her hands, 'I ripped my counterpane\r\nfrom end to end. That takes strength. I had it then. I've little now.\r\n\"All dorn,\" as my little niece says. And you, lad?'\r\n\r\n'\"All dorn\"! Let me keep your case for you till the morning.'\r\n\r\n'But the cold feeling is beginning.'\r\n\r\n'Lend it me, then.'\r\n\r\n'And the drag down my right side. I shan't be able to move in a minute.'\r\n\r\n'I can scarcely lift my arm myself,' said Conroy. 'We're in for it.'\r\n\r\n'Then why are you so foolish? You know it'll be easier if we have only\r\none--only one apiece.'\r\n\r\nShe was lifting the case to her mouth. With tremendous effort Conroy\r\ncaught it. The two moved like jointed dolls, and when their hands met it\r\nwas as wood on wood.\r\n\r\n'You must--not!' said Conroy. His jaws stiffened, and the cold climbed\r\nfrom his feet up.\r\n\r\n'Why--must--I--not?' She repeated the words idiotically.\r\n\r\nConroy could only shake his head, while he bore down on the hand and the\r\ncase in it.\r\n\r\nHer speech went from her altogether. The wonderful lips rested half over\r\nthe even teeth, the breath was in the nostrils only, the eyes dulled,\r\nthe face set grey, and through the glove the hand struck like ice.\r\n\r\nPresently her soul came back and stood behind her eyes--only thing that\r\nhad life in all that place--stood and looked for Conroy's soul. He too\r\nwas fettered in every limb, but somewhere at an immense distance he\r\nheard his heart going about its work as the engine-room carries on\r\nthrough and beneath the all but overwhelming wave. His one hope, he\r\nknew, was not to lose the eyes that clung to his, because there was an\r\nEvil abroad which would possess him if he looked aside by a\r\nhair-breadth.\r\n\r\nThe rest was darkness through which some distant planet spun while\r\ncymbals clashed. (Beyond Farnborough the 10.8 rolls out many empty\r\nmilk-cans at every halt.) Then a body came to life with intolerable\r\npricklings. Limb by limb, after agonies of terror, that body returned to\r\nhim, steeped in most perfect physical weariness such as follows a long\r\nday's rowing. He saw the heavy lids droop over her eyes--the watcher\r\nbehind them departed--and, his soul sinking into assured peace,\r\nConroy slept.\r\n\r\nLight on his eyes and a salt breath roused him without shock. Her hand\r\nstill held his. She slept, forehead down upon it, but the movement of\r\nhis waking waked her too, and she sneezed like a child.\r\n\r\n'I--I think it's morning,' said Conroy.\r\n\r\n'And nothing has happened! Did you see your Men? I didn't see my Faces.\r\nDoes it mean we've escaped? Did--did you take any after I went to sleep?\r\nI'll swear I didn't,' she stammered.\r\n\r\n'No, there wasn't any need. We've slept through it.'\r\n\r\n'No need! Thank God! There was no need! Oh, look!'\r\n\r\nThe train was running under red cliffs along a sea-wall washed by waves\r\nthat were colourless in the early light. Southward the sun rose mistily\r\nupon the Channel.\r\n\r\nShe leaned out of the window and breathed to the bottom of her lungs,\r\nwhile the wind wrenched down her dishevelled hair and blew it below\r\nher waist.\r\n\r\n'Well!' she said with splendid eyes. 'Aren't you still waiting for\r\nsomething to happen?'\r\n\r\n'No. Not till next time. We've been let off,' Conroy answered, breathing\r\nas deeply as she.\r\n\r\n'Then we ought to say our prayers.'\r\n\r\n'What nonsense! Some one will see us.'\r\n\r\n'We needn't kneel. Stand up and say \"Our Father.\" We _must_!'\r\n\r\nIt was the first time since childhood that Conroy had prayed. They\r\nlaughed hysterically when a curve threw them against an arm-rest.\r\n\r\n'Now for breakfast!' she cried. 'My maid--Nurse Blaber--has the basket\r\nand things. It'll be ready in twenty minutes. Oh! Look at my hair!' and\r\nshe went out laughing.\r\n\r\nConroy's first discovery, made without fumbling or counting letters on\r\ntaps, was that the London and South Western's allowance of washing-water\r\nis inadequate. He used every drop, rioting in the cold tingle on neck\r\nand arms. To shave in a moving train balked him, but the next halt gave\r\nhim a chance, which, to his own surprise, he took. As he stared at\r\nhimself in the mirror he smiled and nodded. There were points about this\r\nperson with the clear, if sunken, eye and the almost uncompressed mouth.\r\nBut when he bore his bag back to his compartment, the weight of it on a\r\nlimp arm humbled that new pride.\r\n\r\n'My friend,' he said, half aloud, 'you go into training. You're putty.'\r\n\r\nShe met him in the spare compartment, where her maid had laid breakfast.\r\n\r\n'By Jove!' he said, halting at the doorway, 'I hadn't realised how\r\nbeautiful you were!'\r\n\r\n'The same to you, lad. Sit down. I could eat a horse.'\r\n\r\n'I shouldn't,' said the maid quietly. 'The less you eat the better.' She\r\nwas a small, freckled woman, with light fluffy hair and pale-blue eyes\r\nthat looked through all veils.\r\n\r\n'This is Miss Blaber,' said Miss Henschil. 'He's one of the soul-weary\r\ntoo, Nursey.'\r\n\r\n'I know it. But when one has just given it up a full meal doesn't agree.\r\nThat's why I've only brought you bread and butter.'\r\n\r\nShe went out quietly, and Conroy reddened.\r\n\r\n'We're still children, you see,' said Miss Henschil. 'But I'm well\r\nenough to feel some shame of it. D'you take sugar?'\r\n\r\nThey starved together heroically, and Nurse Blaber was good enough to\r\nsignify approval when she came to clear away.\r\n\r\n'Nursey?' Miss Henschil insinuated, and flushed.\r\n\r\n'Do you smoke?' said the nurse coolly to Conroy.\r\n\r\n'I haven't in years. Now you mention it, I think I'd like a\r\ncigarette--or something.'\r\n\r\n'I used to. D'you think it would keep me quiet?' Miss Henschil said.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps. Try these.' The nurse handed them her cigarette-case.\r\n\r\n'Don't take anything else,' she commanded, and went away with the\r\ntea-basket.\r\n\r\n'Good!' grunted Conroy, between mouthfuls of tobacco.\r\n\r\n'Better than nothing,' said Miss Henschil; but for a while they felt\r\nashamed, yet with the comfort of children punished together.\r\n\r\n'Now,' she whispered, 'who were you when you were a man?'\r\n\r\nConroy told her, and in return she gave him her history. It delighted\r\nthem both to deal once more in worldly concerns--families, names,\r\nplaces, and dates--with a person of understanding.\r\n\r\nShe came, she said, of Lancashire folk--wealthy cotton-spinners, who\r\nstill kept the broadened _a_ and slurred aspirate of the old stock. She\r\nlived with an old masterful mother in an opulent world north of\r\nLancaster Gate, where people in Society gave parties at a Mecca called\r\nthe Langham Hotel.\r\n\r\nShe herself had been launched into Society there, and the flowers at the\r\nball had cost eighty-seven pounds; but, being reckoned peculiar, she had\r\nmade few friends among her own sex. She had attracted many men, for she\r\nwas a beauty--_the_ beauty, in fact, of Society, she said.\r\n\r\nShe spoke utterly without shame or reticence, as a life-prisoner tells\r\nhis past to a fellow-prisoner; and Conroy nodded across the smoke-rings.\r\n\r\n'Do you remember when you got into the carriage?' she asked. '(Oh, I\r\nwish I had some knitting!) Did you notice aught, lad?'\r\n\r\nConroy thought back. It was ages since. 'Wasn't there some one outside\r\nthe door--crying?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'He's--he's the little man I was engaged to,' she said. 'But I made him\r\nbreak it off. I told him 'twas no good. But he won't, yo' see.'\r\n\r\n'_That_ fellow? Why, he doesn't come up to your shoulder.'\r\n\r\n'That's naught to do with it. I think all the world of him. I'm a\r\nfoolish wench'--her speech wandered as she settled herself cosily, one\r\nelbow on the arm-rest. 'We'd been engaged--I couldn't help that--and he\r\nworships the ground I tread on. But it's no use. I'm not responsible,\r\nyou see. His two sisters are against it, though I've the money. They're\r\nright, but they think it's the dri-ink,' she drawled. 'They're\r\nMethody--the Skinners. You see, their grandfather that started the\r\nPatton Mills, he died o' the dri-ink.'\r\n\r\n'I see,' said Conroy. The grave face before him under the lifted veil\r\nwas troubled.\r\n\r\n'George Skinner.' She breathed it softly. 'I'd make him a good wife, by\r\nGod's gra-ace--if I could. But it's no use. I'm not responsible. But\r\nhe'll not take \"No\" for an answer. I used to call him \"Toots.\" He's of\r\nno consequence, yo' see.'\r\n\r\n'That's in Dickens,' said Conroy, quite quickly. 'I haven't thought of\r\nToots for years. He was at Doctor Blimber's.'\r\n\r\n'And so--that's my trouble,' she concluded, ever so slightly wringing\r\nher hands. 'But I--don't you think--there's hope now?'\r\n\r\n'Eh?' said Conroy. 'Oh yes! This is the first time I've turned my corner\r\nwithout help. With your help, I should say.'\r\n\r\n'It'll come back, though.'\r\n\r\n'Then shall we meet it in the same way? Here's my card. Write me your\r\ntrain, and we'll go together.'\r\n\r\n'Yes. We must do that. But between times--when we want--' She looked at\r\nher palm, the four fingers working on it. 'It's hard to give 'em up.'\r\n\r\n'But think what we have gained already, and let me have the case to\r\nkeep.'\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and threw her cigarette out of the window. 'Not\r\nyet.'\r\n\r\n'Then let's lend our cases to Nurse, and we'll get through to-day on\r\ncigarettes. I'll call her while we feel strong.'\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, but yielded at last, and Nurse accepted the offerings\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\n'_You'll_ be all right,' she said to Miss Henschil. 'But if I were\r\nyou'--to Conroy--'I'd take strong exercise.'\r\n\r\nWhen they reached their destination Conroy set himself to obey Nurse\r\nBlaber. He had no remembrance of that day, except one streak of blue sea\r\nto his left, gorse-bushes to his right, and, before him, a coast-guard's\r\ntrack marked with white-washed stones that he counted up to the far\r\nthousands. As he returned to the little town he saw Miss Henschil on the\r\nbeach below the cliffs. She kneeled at Nurse Blaber's feet, weeping\r\nand pleading.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwenty-five days later a telegram came to Conroy's rooms: '_Notice\r\ngiven. Waterloo again. Twenty-fourth.'_ That same evening he was wakened\r\nby the shudder and the sigh that told him his sentence had gone forth.\r\nYet he reflected on his pillow that he had, in spite of lapses, snatched\r\nsomething like three weeks of life, which included several rides on a\r\nhorse before breakfast--the hour one most craves Najdolene; five\r\nconsecutive evenings on the river at Hammersmith in a tub where he had\r\nwell stretched the white arms that passing crews mocked at; a game of\r\nrackets at his club; three dinners, one small dance, and one human\r\nflirtation with a human woman. More notable still, he had settled his\r\nmonth's accounts, only once confusing petty cash with the days of grace\r\nallowed him. Next morning he rode his hired beast in the park\r\nvictoriously. He saw Miss Henschil on horse-back near Lancaster Gate,\r\ntalking to a young man at the railings.\r\n\r\nShe wheeled and cantered toward him.\r\n\r\n'By Jove! How well you look!' he cried, without salutation. 'I didn't\r\nknow you rode.'\r\n\r\n'I used to once,' she replied. 'I'm all soft now.'\r\n\r\nThey swept off together down the ride.\r\n\r\n'Your beast pulls,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Wa-ant him to. Gi-gives me something to think of. How've you been?'\r\nshe panted. 'I wish chemists' shops hadn't red lights.'\r\n\r\n'Have you slipped out and bought some, then?'\r\n\r\n'You don't know Nursey. Eh, but it's good to be on a horse again! This\r\nchap cost me two hundred.'\r\n\r\n'Then you've been swindled,' said Conroy.\r\n\r\n'I know it, but it's no odds. I must go back to Toots and send him away.\r\nHe's neglecting his work for me.'\r\n\r\nShe swung her heavy-topped animal on his none too sound hocks.\r\n''Sentence come, lad?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. But I'm not minding it so much this time.'\r\n\r\n'Waterloo, then--and God help us!' She thundered back to the little\r\nfrock-coated figure that waited faithfully near the gate.\r\n\r\nConroy felt the spring sun on his shoulders and trotted home. That\r\nevening he went out with a man in a pair oar, and was rowed to a\r\nstandstill. But the other man owned he could not have kept the pace five\r\nminutes longer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe carried his bag all down Number 3 platform at Waterloo, and hove it\r\nwith one hand into the rack.\r\n\r\n'Well done!' said Nurse Blaber, in the corridor. 'We've improved too.'\r\n\r\nDr. Gilbert and an older man came out of the next compartment.\r\n\r\n'Hallo!' said Gilbert. 'Why haven't you been to see me, Mr. Conroy? Come\r\nunder the lamp. Take off your hat. No--no. Sit, you young giant. Ve-ry\r\ngood. Look here a minute, Johnnie.'\r\n\r\nA little, round-bellied, hawk-faced person glared at him.\r\n\r\n'Gilbert was right about the beauty of the beast,' he muttered. 'D'you\r\nkeep it in your glove now?' he went on, and punched Conroy in the\r\nshort ribs.\r\n\r\n'No,' said Conroy meekly, but without coughing. 'Nowhere--on my honour!\r\nI've chucked it for good.'\r\n\r\n'Wait till you are a sound man before you say _that_, Mr. Conroy.' Sir\r\nJohn Chartres stumped out, saying to Gilbert in the corridor, 'It's all\r\nvery fine, but the question is shall I or we \"Sir Pandarus of Troy\r\nbecome,\" eh? We're bound to think of the children.'\r\n\r\n'Have you been vetted?' said Miss Henschil, a few minutes after the\r\ntrain started. 'May I sit with you? I--I don't trust myself yet. I can't\r\ngive up as easily as you can, seemingly.'\r\n\r\n'Can't you? I never saw any one so improved in a month.'\r\n\r\n'Look here!' She reached across to the rack, single-handed lifted\r\nConroy's bag, and held it at arm's length. 'I counted ten slowly. And I\r\ndidn't think of hours or minutes,' she boasted.\r\n\r\n'Don't remind me,' he cried.\r\n\r\n'Ah! Now I've reminded myself. I wish I hadn't. Do you think it'll be\r\neasier for us to-night?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, don't.' The smell of the carriage had brought back all his last\r\ntrip to him, and Conroy moved uneasily.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry. I've brought some games,' she went on. 'Draughts and\r\ncards--but they all mean counting. I wish I'd brought chess, but I can't\r\nplay chess. What can we do? Talk about something.'\r\n\r\n'Well, how's Toots, to begin with?' said Conroy.\r\n\r\n'Why? Did you see him on the platform?'\r\n\r\n'No. Was he there? I didn't notice.'\r\n\r\n'Oh yes. He doesn't understand. He's desperately jealous. I told him it\r\ndoesn't matter. Will you please let me hold your hand? I believe I'm\r\nbeginning to get the chill.'\r\n\r\n'Toots ought to envy me,' said Conroy.\r\n\r\n'He does. He paid you a high compliment the other night. He's taken to\r\ncalling again--in spite of all they say.'\r\n\r\nConroy inclined his head. He felt cold, and knew surely he would be\r\ncolder.\r\n\r\n'He said,' she yawned. '(Beg your pardon.) He said he couldn't see how I\r\ncould help falling in love with a man like you; and he called himself a\r\ndamned little rat, and he beat his head on the piano last night.'\r\n\r\n'The piano? You play, then?'\r\n\r\n'Only to him. He thinks the world of my accomplishments. Then I told him\r\nI wouldn't have you if you were the last man on earth instead of only\r\nthe best-looking--not with a million in each stocking.'\r\n\r\n'No, not with a million in each stocking,' said Conroy vehemently.\r\n'Isn't that odd?'\r\n\r\n'I suppose so--to any one who doesn't know. Well, where was I? Oh,\r\nGeorge as good as told me I was deceiving him, and he wanted to go away\r\nwithout saying good-night. He hates standing a-tiptoe, but he must if I\r\nwon't sit down.'\r\n\r\nConroy would have smiled, but the chill that foreran the coming of the\r\nLier-in-Wait was upon him, and his hand closed warningly on hers.\r\n\r\n'And--and so--' she was trying to say, when her hour also overtook her,\r\nleaving alive only the fear-dilated eyes that turned to Conroy. Hand\r\nfroze on hand and the body with it as they waited for the horror in the\r\nblackness that heralded it. Yet through the worst Conroy saw, at an\r\nuncountable distance, one minute glint of light in his night. Thither\r\nwould he go and escape his fear; and behold, that light was the light in\r\nthe watch-tower of her eyes, where her locked soul signalled to his\r\nsoul: 'Look at me!'\r\n\r\nIn time, from him and from her, the Thing sheered aside, that each soul\r\nmight step down and resume its own concerns. He thought confusedly of\r\npeople on the skirts of a thunderstorm, withdrawing from windows where\r\nthe torn night is, to their known and furnished beds. Then he dozed,\r\ntill in some drowsy turn his hand fell from her warmed hand.\r\n\r\n'That's all. The Faces haven't come,' he heard her say. 'All--thank God!\r\nI don't feel even I need what Nursey promised me. Do you?'\r\n\r\n'No.' He rubbed his eyes. 'But don't make too sure.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly not. We shall have to try again next month. I'm afraid it\r\nwill be an awful nuisance for you.'\r\n\r\n'Not to me, I assure you,' said Conroy, and they leaned back and\r\nlaughed at the flatness of the words, after the hells through which they\r\nhad just risen.\r\n\r\n'And now,' she said, strict eyes on Conroy, '_why_ wouldn't you take\r\nme--not with a million in each stocking?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know. That's what I've been puzzling over.'\r\n\r\n'So have I. We're as handsome a couple as I've ever seen. Are you well\r\noff, lad?'\r\n\r\n'They call me so,' said Conroy, smiling.\r\n\r\n'That's North country.' She laughed again. Setting aside my good looks\r\nand yours, I've four thousand a year of my own, and the rents should\r\nmake it six. That's a match some old cats would lap tea all night to\r\nfettle up.'\r\n\r\n'It is. Lucky Toots!' said Conroy.\r\n\r\n'Ay,' she answered, 'he'll be the luckiest lad in London if I win\r\nthrough. Who's yours?'\r\n\r\n'No--no one, dear. I've been in Hell for years. I only want to get out\r\nand be alive and--so on. Isn't that reason enough?'\r\n\r\n'Maybe, for a man. But I never minded things much till George came. I\r\nwas all stu-upid like.'\r\n\r\n'So was I, but now I think I can live. It ought to be less next month,\r\noughtn't it?' he said.\r\n\r\n'I hope so. Ye-es. There's nothing much for a maid except to be married,\r\nand I ask no more. Whoever yours is, when you've found her, she shall\r\nhave a wedding present from Mrs. George Skinner that--'\r\n\r\n'But she wouldn't understand it any more than Toots.'\r\n\r\n'He doesn't matter--except to me. I can't keep my eyes open, thank God!\r\nGood-night, lad.'\r\n\r\nConroy followed her with his eyes. Beauty there was, grace there was,\r\nstrength, and enough of the rest to drive better men than George Skinner\r\nto beat their heads on piano-tops--but for the new-found life of him\r\nConroy could not feel one flutter of instinct or emotion that turned to\r\nherward. He put up his feet and fell asleep, dreaming of a joyous,\r\nnormal world recovered--with interest on arrears. There were many things\r\nin it, but no one face of any one woman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThrice afterward they took the same train, and each time their trouble\r\nshrank and weakened. Miss Henschil talked of Toots, his multiplied\r\ncalls, the things he had said to his sisters, the much worse things his\r\nsisters had replied; of the late (he seemed very dead to them) M.\r\nNajdol's gifts for the soul-weary; of shopping, of house rents, and the\r\ncost of really artistic furniture and linen.\r\n\r\nConroy explained the exercises in which he delighted--mighty labours of\r\nplay undertaken against other mighty men, till he sweated and, having\r\nbathed, slept. He had visited his mother, too, in Hereford, and he\r\ntalked something of her and of the home-life, which his body, cut out of\r\nall clean life for five years, innocently and deeply enjoyed. Nurse\r\nBlaber was a little interested in Conroy's mother, but, as a rule, she\r\nsmoked her cigarette and read her paper-backed novels in her own\r\ncompartment.\r\n\r\nOn their last trip she volunteered to sit with them, and buried herself\r\nin _The Cloister and the Hearth_ while they whispered together. On that\r\noccasion (it was near Salisbury) at two in the morning, when the\r\nLier-in-Wait brushed them with his wing, it meant no more than that they\r\nshould cease talk for the instant, and for the instant hold hands, as\r\neven utter strangers on the deep may do when their ship rolls underfoot.\r\n\r\n'But still,' said Nurse Blaber, not looking up, 'I think your Mr.\r\nSkinner might feel jealous of all this.'\r\n\r\n'It would be difficult to explain,' said Conroy.\r\n\r\n'Then you'd better not be at my wedding,' Miss Henschil laughed.\r\n\r\n'After all we've gone through, too. But I suppose you ought to leave me\r\nout. Is the day fixed?' he cried.\r\n\r\n'Twenty-second of September--in spite of both his sisters. I can risk it\r\nnow.' Her face was glorious as she flushed.\r\n\r\n'My dear chap!' He shook hands unreservedly, and she gave back his grip\r\nwithout flinching. 'I can't tell you how pleased I am!'\r\n\r\n'Gracious Heavens!' said Nurse Blaber, in a new voice. 'Oh, I beg your\r\npardon. I forgot I wasn't paid to be surprised.'\r\n\r\n'What at? Oh, I see!' Miss Henschil explained to Conroy. 'She expected\r\nyou were going to kiss me, or I was going to kiss you, or something.'\r\n\r\n'After all you've gone through, as Mr. Conroy said,'\r\n\r\n'But I couldn't, could you?' said Miss Henschil, with a disgust as frank\r\nas that on Conroy's face. 'It would be horrible--horrible. And yet, of\r\ncourse, you're wonderfully handsome. How d'you account for it, Nursey?'\r\n\r\nNurse Blaber shook her head. 'I was hired to cure you of a habit, dear.\r\nWhen you're cured I shall go on to the next case--that senile-decay one\r\nat Bourne-mouth I told you about.'\r\n\r\n'And I shall be left alone with George! But suppose it isn't cured,'\r\nsaid Miss Henschil of a sudden. Suppose it comes back again. What can I\r\ndo? I can't send for _him_ in this way when I'm a married woman!' She\r\npointed like an infant.\r\n\r\n'I'd come, of course,' Conroy answered. 'But, seriously, that is a\r\nconsideration.'\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other, alarmed and anxious, and then toward Nurse\r\nBlaber, who closed her book, marked the place, and turned to face them.\r\n\r\n'Have you ever talked to your mother as you have to me?' she said.\r\n\r\n'No. I might have spoken to dad--but mother's different. What d'you\r\nmean?'\r\n\r\n'And you've never talked to your mother either, Mr. Conroy?'\r\n\r\n'Not till I took Najdolene. Then I told her it was my heart. There's no\r\nneed to say anything, now that I'm practically over it, is there?'\r\n\r\n'Not if it doesn't come back, but--' She beckoned with a stumpy,\r\ntriumphant linger that drew their heads close together. 'You know I\r\nalways go in and read a chapter to mother at tea, child.'\r\n\r\n'I know you do. You're an angel,' Miss Henschil patted the blue\r\nshoulder next her. 'Mother's Church of England now,' she explained. 'But\r\nshe'll have her Bible with her pikelets at tea every night like the\r\nSkinners.'\r\n\r\n'It was Naaman and Gehazi last Tuesday that gave me a clue. I said I'd\r\nnever seen a case of leprosy, and your mother said she'd seen too many.'\r\n\r\n'Where? She never told me,' Miss Henschil began.\r\n\r\n'A few months before you were born--on her trip to Australia--at Mola or\r\nMolo something or other. It took me three evenings to get it all out.'\r\n\r\n'Ay--mother's suspicious of questions,' said Miss Henschil to Conroy.\r\n'She'll lock the door of every room she's in, if it's but for five\r\nminutes. She was a Tackberry from Jarrow way, yo' see.'\r\n\r\n'She described your men to the life--men with faces all eaten away,\r\nstaring at her over the fence of a lepers' hospital in this Molo Island.\r\nThey begged from her, and she ran, she told me, all down the street,\r\nback to the pier. One touched her and she nearly fainted. She's ashamed\r\nof that still.'\r\n\r\n'My men? The sand and the fences?' Miss Henschil muttered.\r\n\r\n'Yes. You know how tidy she is and how she hates wind. She remembered\r\nthat the fences were broken--she remembered the wind blowing.\r\nSand--sun--salt wind--fences--faces--I got it all out of her, bit by\r\nbit. You don't know what I know! And it all happened three or four\r\nmonths before you were born. There!' Nurse Blaber slapped her knee with\r\nher little hand triumphantly.\r\n\r\n'Would that account for it?' Miss Henschil shook from head to foot.\r\n\r\n'Absolutely. I don't care who you ask! You never imagined the thing. It\r\nwas _laid_ on you. It happened on earth to _you_! Quick, Mr. Conroy,\r\nshe's too heavy for me! I'll get the flask.'\r\n\r\nMiss Henschil leaned forward and collapsed, as Conroy told her\r\nafterwards, like a factory chimney. She came out of her swoon with teeth\r\nthat chattered on the cup.\r\n\r\n'No--no,' she said, gulping. 'It's not hysterics. Yo' see I've no call\r\nto hev 'em any more. No call--no reason whatever. God be praised! Can't\r\nyo' _feel_ I'm a right woman now?'\r\n\r\n'Stop hugging me!' said Nurse Blaber. 'You don't know your strength.\r\nFinish the brandy and water. It's perfectly reasonable, and I'll lay\r\nlong odds Mr. Conroy's case is something of the same. I've been\r\nthinking--'\r\n\r\n'I wonder--' said Conroy, and pushed the girl back as she swayed again.\r\n\r\nNurse Blaber smoothed her pale hair. 'Yes. Your trouble, or something\r\nlike it, happened somewhere on earth or sea to the mother who bore you.\r\nAsk her, child. Ask her and be done with it once for all.'\r\n\r\n'I will,' said Conroy.... 'There ought to be--' He opened his bag and\r\nhunted breathlessly.\r\n\r\n'Bless you! Oh, God bless you, Nursey!' Miss Henschil was sobbing. 'You\r\ndon't know what this means to me. It takes it all off--from the\r\nbeginning.'\r\n\r\n'But doesn't it make any difference to you now?' the nurse asked\r\ncuriously. 'Now that you're rightfully a woman?'\r\n\r\nConroy, busy with his bag, had not heard. Miss Henschil stared across,\r\nand her beauty, freed from the shadow of any fear, blazed up within her.\r\n'I see what you mean,' she said. 'But it hasn't changed anything. I want\r\nToots. _He_ has never been out of his mind in his life--except over\r\nsilly me.'\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' said Conroy, stooping under the lamp,\r\nBradshaw in hand. 'If I change at Templecombe--for Bristol\r\n(Bristol--Hereford--yes)--I can be with mother for breakfast in her room\r\nand find out.'\r\n\r\n'Quick, then,' said Nurse Blaber. 'We've passed Gillingham quite a\r\nwhile. You'd better take some of our sandwiches.' She went out to get\r\nthem. Conroy and Miss Henschil would have danced, but there is no room\r\nfor giants in a South-Western compartment.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye, good luck, lad. Eh, but you've changed already--like me. Send\r\na wire to our hotel as soon as you're sure,' said Miss Henschil. 'What\r\nshould I have done without you?'\r\n\r\n'Or I?' said Conroy. 'But it's Nurse that's saving us really.'\r\n\r\n'Then thank her,' said Miss Henschil, looking straight at him. 'Yes, I\r\nwould. She'd like it.'\r\n\r\nWhen Nurse Blaber came back after the parting at Templecombe her nose\r\nand her eyelids were red, but, for all that, her face reflected a great\r\nlight even while she sniffed over _The Cloister and the Hearth_.\r\n\r\nMiss Henschil, deep in a house furnisher's catalogue, did not speak for\r\ntwenty minutes. Then she said, between adding totals of best, guest, and\r\nservants' sheets, 'But why should our times have been the same, Nursey?'\r\n\r\n'Because a child is born somewhere every second of the clock,' Nurse\r\nBlaber answered. 'And besides that, you probably set each other off by\r\ntalking and thinking about it. You shouldn't, you know.'\r\n\r\n'Ay, but you've never been in Hell,' said Miss Henschil.\r\n\r\nThe telegram handed in at Hereford at 12.46 and delivered to Miss\r\nHenschil on the beach of a certain village at 2.7 ran thus:\r\n\r\n'\"_Absolutely confirmed.

Stalky's upstairs changing.\r\nDinner's at 7.15 sharp, because we're hungry. His room's next to yours,'\r\nsaid The Infant, nursing a cobwebbed bottle of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nThen I found Lieutenant-Colonel A.L. Corkran, I.A., who borrowed a\r\ncollar-stud and told me about the East and his Sikh regiment.\r\n\r\n'And are your subalterns as good as ever?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Amazin'--simply amazin'! All I've got to do is to find 'em jobs. They\r\nkeep touchin' their caps to me and askin' for more work. 'Come at me\r\nwith their tongues hangin' out. _I_ used to run the other way at\r\ntheir age.'\r\n\r\n'And when they err?' said I. 'I suppose they do sometimes?'\r\n\r\n'Then they run to me again to weep with remorse over their virgin\r\npeccadilloes. I never cuddled my Colonel when I was in trouble.\r\nLambs--positive lambs!'\r\n\r\n'And what do you say to 'em?'\r\n\r\n'Talk to 'em like a papa. Tell 'em how I can't understand it, an' how\r\nshocked I am, and how grieved their parents'll be; and throw in a\r\nlittle about the Army Regulations and the Ten Commandments. 'Makes one\r\nfeel rather a sweep when one thinks of what one used to do at their age.\r\nD'you remember--'\r\n\r\nWe remembered together till close on seven o'clock. As we went out into\r\nthe gallery that runs round the big hall, we saw The Infant, below,\r\ntalking to two deferential well-set-up lads whom I had known, on and\r\noff, in the holidays, any time for the last ten years. One of them had a\r\nbruised cheek, and the other a weeping left eye.\r\n\r\n'Yes, that's the style,' said Stalky below his breath. 'They're brought\r\nup on lemon-squash and mobilisation text-books. I say, the girls we knew\r\nmust have been much better than they pretended they were; for I'll swear\r\nit isn't the fathers.'\r\n\r\n'But why on earth did you do it?' The Infant was shouting. 'You know\r\nwhat it means nowadays.'\r\n\r\n'Well, sir,' said Bobby Trivett, the taller of the two, 'Wontner talks\r\ntoo much, for one thing. He didn't join till he was twenty-three, and,\r\nbesides that, he used to lecture on tactics in the ante-room. He said\r\nClausewitz was the only tactician, and he illustrated his theories with\r\ncigar-ends. He was that sort of chap, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And he didn't much care whose cigar-ends they were,' said Eames, who\r\nwas shorter and pinker.\r\n\r\n'And then he _would_ talk about the 'Varsity,' said Bobby. 'He got a\r\ndegree there. And he told us we weren't intellectual. He told the\r\nAdjutant so, sir. He was just that kind of chap, sir, if you\r\nunderstand.'\r\n\r\nStalky and I backed behind a tall Japanese jar of chrysanthemums and\r\nlistened more intently.\r\n\r\n'Was all the Mess in it, or only you two?' The Infant demanded, chewing\r\nhis moustache.\r\n\r\n'The Adjutant went to bed, of course, sir, and the Senior Subaltern said\r\nhe wasn't going to risk his commission--they're awfully down on ragging\r\nnowadays in the Service--but the rest of us--er--attended to him,'\r\nsaid Bobby.\r\n\r\n'Much?' The Infant asked. The boys smiled deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n'Not in the ante-room, sir,' said Eames. 'Then he called us silly\r\nchildren, and went to bed, and we sat up discussin', and I suppose we\r\ngot a bit above ourselves, and we--er--'\r\n\r\n'Went to his quarters and drew him?' The Infant suggested.\r\n\r\n'Well, we only asked him to get out of bed, and we put his helmet and\r\nsword-belt on for him, and we sung him bits out of the Blue Fairy\r\nBook--the cram-book on Army organisation. Oh yes, and then we asked him\r\nto drink old Clausewitz's health, as a brother-tactician, in milk-punch\r\nand Worcester sauce, and so on. We had to help him a little there. He\r\nbites. There wasn't much else that time; but, you know, the War Office\r\nis severe on ragging these days.' Bobby stopped with a lopsided smile.\r\n\r\n'And then,' Eames went on, 'then Wontner said we'd done several pounds'\r\nworth of damage to his furniture.'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said The Infant, 'he's that kind of man, is he? Does he brush his\r\nteeth?'\r\n\r\n'Oh yes, he's quite clean all over!' said Trivett; 'but his father's a\r\nwealthy barrister.'\r\n\r\n'Solicitor,' Eames corrected, 'and so this Mister Wontner is out for our\r\nblood. He's going to make a first-class row about it--appeal to the War\r\nOffice--court of inquiry--spicy bits in the papers, and songs in the\r\nmusic-halls. He told us so.'\r\n\r\n'That's the sort of chap he is,' said Trivett. 'And that means old\r\nDhurrah-bags, our Colonel, 'll be put on half-pay, same as that case in\r\nthe Scarifungers' Mess; and our Adjutant'll have to exchange, like it\r\nwas with that fellow in the 73rd Dragoons, and there'll be misery all\r\nround. He means making it too hot for us, and his papa'll back him.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, that's all very fine,' said The Infant; 'but I left the Service\r\nabout the time you were born, Bobby. What's it got to do with me?'\r\n\r\n'Father told me I was always to go to you when I was in trouble, and\r\nyou've been awfully good to me since he ...'\r\n\r\n'Better stay to dinner.' The Infant mopped his forehead.\r\n\r\n'Thank you very much, but the fact is--' Trivett halted.\r\n\r\n'This afternoon, about four, to be exact--' Eames broke in.\r\n\r\n'We went over to Wontner's quarters to talk things over. The row only\r\nhappened last night, and we found him writing letters as hard as he\r\ncould to his father--getting up his case for the War Office, you know.\r\nHe read us some of 'em, but I'm not a good judge of style. We tried to\r\nride him off quietly--apologies and so forth--but it was the milk-punch\r\nand mayonnaise that defeated us.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, he wasn't taking anything except pure revenge,' said Eames.\r\n\r\n'He said he'd make an example of the regiment, and he was particularly\r\nglad that he'd landed our Colonel. He told us so. Old Dhurrah-bags don't\r\nsympathise with Wontner's tactical lectures. He says Wontner ought to\r\nlearn manners first, but we thought--' Trivett turned to Eames, who was\r\nless a son of the house than himself, Eames's father being still alive.\r\n\r\n'Then,' Eames went on, 'he became rather noisome, and we thought we\r\nmight as well impound the correspondence'--he wrinkled his swelled left\r\neye--'and after that, we got him to take a seat in my car.'\r\n\r\n'He was in a sack, you know,' Trivett explained. 'He wouldn't go any\r\nother way. But we didn't hurt him.'\r\n\r\n'Oh no! His head's sticking out quite clear, and'--Eames rushed the\r\nfence--'we've put him in your garage--er _pendente lite_.'\r\n\r\n'My garage!' Infant's voice nearly broke with horror.\r\n\r\n'Well, father always told me if I was in trouble, Uncle George--'\r\n\r\nBobby's sentence died away as The Infant collapsed on a divan and said\r\nno more than, 'Your commissions!' There was a long, long silence.\r\n\r\n'What price your latter-day lime-juice subaltern?' I whispered to\r\nStalky behind my hand. His nostrils expanded, and he drummed on the edge\r\nof the Japanese jar with his knuckles.\r\n\r\n'Confound your father, Bobby!' The Infant groaned. 'Raggin's a criminal\r\noffence these days. It isn't as if--'\r\n\r\n'Come on,' said Stalky. 'That was my old Line battalion in Egypt. They\r\nnearly slung old Dhurrah-bags and me out of the Service in '85 for\r\nragging.' He descended the stairs and The Infant rolled appealing\r\neyes at him.\r\n\r\n'I heard what you youngsters have confessed,' he began; and in his\r\norderly-room voice, which is almost as musical as his singing one, he\r\ntongue-lashed those lads in such sort as was a privilege and a\r\nrevelation to listen to. Till then they had known him almost as a\r\nrelative--we were all brevet, deputy, or acting uncles to The Infant's\r\nfriends' brood--a sympathetic elder brother, sound on finance. They had\r\nnever met Colonel A.L. Corkran in the Chair of Justice. And while he\r\nflayed and rent and blistered, and wiped the floor with them, and while\r\nthey looked for hiding-places and found none on that floor, I remembered\r\n(1) the up-ending of 'Dolly' Macshane at Dalhousie, which came\r\nperilously near a court-martial on Second-Lieutenant Corkran; (2) the\r\nburning of Captain Parmilee's mosquito-curtains on a hot Indian dawn,\r\nwhen the captain slept in his garden, and Lieutenant Corkran, smoking,\r\nrode by after a successful whist night at the club; (3) the\r\nintroduction of an ekka pony, with ekka attached, into a brother\r\ncaptain's tent on a frosty night in Peshawur, and the removal of tent,\r\npole, cot, and captain all wrapped in chilly canvas; (4) the bath that\r\nwas given to Elliot-Hacker on his own verandah--his lady-love saw it and\r\nbroke off the engagement, which was what the Mess intended, she being an\r\nEurasian--and the powdering all over of Elliot-Hacker with flour and\r\nturmeric from the bazaar.\r\n\r\nWhen he took breath I realised how only Satan can rebuke sin. The good\r\ndon't know enough.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said Stalky, 'get out! No, not out of the house. Go to your\r\nrooms.'\r\n\r\n'I'll send your dinner, Bobby,' said The Infant. 'Ipps!'\r\n\r\nNothing had ever been known to astonish Ipps, the butler. He entered and\r\nwithdrew with his charges. After all, he had suffered from Bobby since\r\nBobby's twelfth year.\r\n\r\n'They've done everything they could, short of murder,' said The Infant.\r\n'You know what this'll mean for the regiment. It isn't as if we were\r\ndealing with Sahibs nowadays.'\r\n\r\n'Quite so.' Stalky turned on me. 'Go and release the bagman,' he said.\r\n\r\n''Tisn't my garage,' I pleaded. 'I'm company. Besides, he'll probably\r\nslay me. He's been in the sack for hours.'\r\n\r\n'Look here,' Stalky thundered--the years had fallen from us both--'is\r\nyour--am I commandin' or are you? We've got to pull this thing off\r\nsomehow or other. Cut over to the garage, make much of him, and bring\r\nhim over. He's dining with us. Be quick, you dithering ass!'\r\n\r\nI was quick enough; but as I ran through the shrubbery I wondered how\r\none extricates the subaltern of the present day from a sack without\r\nhurting his feelings. Anciently, one slit the end open, taking off his\r\nboots first, and then fled.\r\n\r\nImagine a sumptuously-equipped garage, half-filled by The Infant's\r\ncobalt-blue, grey-corded silk limousine and a mud-splashed, cheap,\r\nhooded four-seater. In the back seat of this last, conceive a fiery\r\nchestnut head emerging from a long oat-sack; an implacable white face,\r\nwith blazing eyes and jaws that worked ceaselessly at the loop of the\r\nstring that was drawn round its neck. The effect, under the electrics,\r\nwas that of a demon caterpillar wrathfully spinning its own cocoon.\r\n\r\n'Good evening!' I said genially. 'Let me help you out of that.' The head\r\nglared. 'We've got 'em,' I went on. 'They came to quite the wrong shop\r\nfor this sort of game--quite the wrong shop.'\r\n\r\n'Game!' said the head. 'We'll see about that. Let me out.'\r\n\r\nIt was not a promising voice for one so young, and, as usual, I had no\r\nknife.\r\n\r\n'You've chewed the string so I can't find the knot,' I said as I worked\r\nwith trembling fingers at the cater-pillar's throat. Something untied\r\nitself, and Mr. Wontner wriggled out, collarless, tieless, his coat\r\nsplit half down his back, his waistcoat unbuttoned, his watch-chain\r\nsnapped, his trousers rucked well above the knees.\r\n\r\n'Where,' he said grimly, as he pulled them down, 'are Master Trivett and\r\nMaster Eames?'\r\n\r\n'Both arrested, of course,' I replied. 'Sir George'--I gave The Infant's\r\nfull title as a baronet--'is a Justice of the Peace. He'd be very\r\npleased if you dined with us. There's a room ready for you.' I picked\r\nup the sack.\r\n\r\n'D'you know,' said Mr. Wontner through his teeth--but the car's bonnet\r\nwas between us, 'that this looks to me like--I won't say conspiracy\r\n_yet_, but uncommonly like a confederacy.'\r\n\r\nWhen injured souls begin to distinguish and qualify, danger is over. So\r\nI grew bold.\r\n\r\n''Sorry you take it that way,' I said. 'You come here in trouble--'\r\n\r\n'My good fool,' he interrupted, with a half-hysterical snort, 'let me\r\nassure you that the trouble will recoil on the other men!'\r\n\r\n'As you please,' I went on. 'Anyhow, the chaps who got you into trouble\r\nare arrested, and the magistrate who arrested 'em asks you to dinner.\r\nShall I tell him you're walking back to Aldershot?'\r\n\r\nHe picked some fluff off his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n'I'm in no position to dictate terms yet,' he said. 'That will come\r\nlater. I must probe into this a little further. In the meantime, I\r\naccept your invitation without prejudice--if you understand what\r\nthat means.'\r\n\r\nI understood and began to be happy again. Sub-alterns without\r\nprejudices were quite new to me. 'All right,' I replied; 'if you'll go\r\nup to the house, I'll turn out the lights.'\r\n\r\nHe walked off stiffly, while I searched the sack and the car for the\r\nimpounded correspondence that Bobby had talked of. I found nothing\r\nexcept, as the police reports say, the trace of a struggle. He had\r\nkicked half the varnish off the back of the front seat, and had bitten\r\nthe leather padding where he could reach it. Evidently a purposeful and\r\nhard-mouthed young gentleman.\r\n\r\n'Well done!' said Stalky at the door. 'So he didn't slay you. Stop\r\nlaughing. He's talking to The Infant now about depositions. Look here,\r\nyou're nearest his size. Cut up to your rooms and give Ipps your dinner\r\nthings and a clean shirt for him.'\r\n\r\n'But I haven't got another suit,' I said.\r\n\r\n'You! I'm not thinking of you! We've got to conciliate _him_. He's in\r\nfilthy rags and a filthy temper, and he won't feel decent till he's\r\ndressed. You're the sacrifice. Be quick! And clean socks, remember!'\r\n\r\nOnce more I trotted up to my room, changed into unseasonable unbrushed\r\ngrey tweeds, put studs into a clean shirt, dug out fresh socks, handed\r\nthe whole garniture over to Ipps, and returned to the hall just in time\r\nto hear Stalky say, 'I'm a stockbroker, but I have the honour to hold\r\nHis Majesty's commission in a Territorial battalion.' Then I felt as\r\nthough I might be beginning to be repaid.\r\n\r\n'I have a very high opinion of the Territorials myself,' said Mr.\r\nWontner above a glass of sherry. (Infant never lets us put bitters into\r\nanything above twenty years old.) 'But if you had any experience of the\r\nService, you would find that the Average Army Man--'\r\n\r\nHere The Infant suggested changing, and Ipps, before whom no human\r\npassion can assert itself, led Mr. Wontner away.\r\n\r\n'Why the devil did you tell him I was on the Bench?' said Infant\r\nwrathfully to me. 'You know I ain't now. Why didn't he stay in his\r\nfather's office? He's a raging blight!'\r\n\r\n'Not a bit of it,' said Stalky cheerfully. 'He's a little shaken and\r\nexcited. Probably Beetle annoyed him in the garage, but we must overlook\r\nthat. We've contained him so far, and I'm going to nibble round his\r\noutposts at dinner. All you've got to do, Infant, is to remember you're\r\na gentleman in your own house. Don't hop! You'll find it pretty\r\ndifficult before dinner's over. I don't want to hear anything at all\r\nfrom you, Beetle.'\r\n\r\n'But I'm just beginning to like him,' I said. 'Do let me play!'\r\n\r\n'Not till I ask you. You'll overdo it. Poor old Dhurrah-bags! A scandal\r\n'ud break him up!'\r\n\r\n'But as long as a regiment has no say as to who joins it, it's bound to\r\nrag,' Infant began. 'Why--why, they varnished me when I joined!' He\r\nsquirmed at the thought of it.\r\n\r\n'Don't be owls! We ain't discussing principles! We've got to save the\r\ncourt of inquiry if we can,' said Stalky.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later--at 7.45 to be precise--we four sat down to such a\r\ndinner as, I hold, only The Infant's cook can produce, with wines worthy\r\nof pontifical banquets. A man in the extremity of rage and injured\r\ndignity is precisely like a typhoid patient. He asks no questions,\r\naccepts what is put before him, and babbles in one key--very often of\r\ntrifles. But food and drink are the very best of drugs. I think it was\r\nHeidsieck Dry Monopole '92--Stalky as usual stuck to Burgundy--that\r\nbegan to unlock Mr. Wontner's heart behind my shirt-front. Me he snubbed\r\nthroughout, after the Oxford manner, because I had seen him in the sack,\r\nand he did not intend me to presume; but to Stalky and The Infant, while\r\nI admired the set of my dinner-jacket across his shoulders, he made his\r\nplans of revenge very clear indeed. He had even sketched out some of the\r\nparagraphs that were to appear in the papers, and if Stalky had allowed\r\nme to speak, I would have told him that they were rather neatly phrased.\r\n\r\n'You ought to be able to get whackin' damages out of 'em, into the\r\nbargain,' said Stalky, after Mr. Wontner had outlined his\r\nposition legally.\r\n\r\n'My de-ah sir,' Mr. Wontner applied himself to his glass, 'it isn't a\r\nmatter that gentlemen usually discuss, but, I assure you, we\r\nWontners'--he waved a well-kept hand--'do not stand in any need of\r\nfilthy lucre.' In the next three minutes, we learned exactly what his\r\nfather was worth, which, as he pointed out, was a trifle no man of the\r\nworld dwelt on. Stalky envied aloud, and I delivered my first kick at\r\nThe Infant's ankle. Thence we drifted to education, and the Average Army\r\nMan, and the desolating vacuity--I remember these words--of Army\r\nSociety, notably among its womenkind. It appeared there was some sort of\r\nnarrow convention in the Army against mentioning a woman's name at Mess.\r\nWe were much surprised at this--Stalky would not let me express my\r\nsurprise--but we took it from Mr. Wontner, who said we might, that it\r\nwas so. Next he touched on Colonels of the old school, and their\r\ncognisance of tactics. Not that he himself pretended to any skill in\r\ntactics, but after three years at the 'Varsity--none of us had had a\r\n'Varsity education--a man insensibly contracted the habit of clear\r\nthinking. At least, he could automatically co-ordinate his ideas, and\r\nthe jealousy of these muddle-headed Colonels was inconceivable. We would\r\nunderstand that it was his duty to force on the retirement of his\r\nColonel, who had been in the conspiracy against him; to make his\r\nAdjutant resign or exchange; and to give the half-dozen childish\r\nsubalterns who had vexed his dignity a chance to retrieve themselves in\r\nother corps--West African ones, he hoped. For himself, after the case\r\nwas decided, he proposed to go on living in the regiment, just to\r\nprove--for he bore no malice--that times had changed, _nosque mutamur in\r\nillis_--if we knew what that meant. Infant had curled his legs out of\r\nreach, so I was quite free to return thanks yet once more to Allah for\r\nthe diversity of His creatures in His adorable world.\r\n\r\nAnd so, by way of an eighty-year-old liqueur brandy, to tactics and the\r\ngreat General Clausewitz, unknown to the Average Army Man. Here The\r\nInfant, at a whisper from Ipps--whose face had darkened like a mulberry\r\nwhile he waited--excused himself and went away, but Stalky, Colonel of\r\nTerritorials, wanted some tips on tactics. He got them unbrokenly for\r\nten minutes--Wontner and Clausewitz mixed, but Wontner in a film of\r\npriceless cognac distinctly on top. When The Infant came back, he\r\nrenewed his clear-spoken demand that Infant should take his depositions.\r\nI supposed this to be a family trait of the Wontners, whom I had been\r\nvisualising for some time past even to the third generation.\r\n\r\n'But, hang it all, they're both asleep!' said Infant, scowling at me.\r\n'Ipps let 'em have the '81 port.'\r\n\r\n'Asleep!' said Stalky, rising at once. 'I don't see that makes any\r\ndifference. As a matter of form, you'd better identify them. I'll show\r\nyou the way.'\r\n\r\nWe followed up the white stone side-staircase that leads to the\r\nbachelors' wing. Mr. Wontner seemed surprised that the boys were not in\r\nthe coal-cellar.\r\n\r\n'Oh, a chap's assumed to be innocent until he's proved guilty,' said\r\nStalky, mounting step by step. 'How did they get you into the sack,\r\nMr. Wontner?'\r\n\r\n'Jumped on me from behind--two to one,' said Mr. Wontner briefly. 'I\r\nthink I handed each of them something first, but they roped my arms\r\nand legs.'\r\n\r\n'And did they photograph you in the sack?'\r\n\r\n'Good Heavens, no!' Mr. Wontner shuddered.\r\n\r\n'That's lucky. Awful thing to live down--a photograph, isn't it?' said\r\nStalky to me as we reached the landing. 'I'm thinking of the newspapers,\r\nof course.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, but you can easily have sketches in the illustrated papers from\r\naccounts supplied by eye-witnesses,' I said.\r\n\r\nMr. Wontner turned him round. It was the first time he had honoured me\r\nby his notice since our talk in the garage.\r\n\r\n'Ah,' said he, 'do you pretend to any special knowledge in these\r\nmatters?'\r\n\r\n'I'm a journalist by profession,' I answered simply but nobly. 'As soon\r\nas you're at liberty, I'd like to have your account of the affair.'\r\n\r\nNow I thought he would have loved me for this, but he only replied in an\r\nuncomfortable, uncoming-on voice, 'Oh, you would, would you?'\r\n\r\n'Not if it's any trouble, of course,' I said. 'I can always get their\r\nversion from the defendants. Do either of 'em draw or sketch at all, Mr.\r\nWontner? Or perhaps your father might--'\r\n\r\nThen he said quite hotly, 'I wish you to understand very clearly, my\r\ngood man, that a gentleman's name can't be dragged through the gutter to\r\nbolster up the circulation of your wretched sheet, whatever it may be.'\r\n\r\n'It is ----' I named a journal of enormous sales which specialises in\r\nscholastic, military, and other scandals. 'I don't know yet what it\r\ncan't do, Mr. Wontner.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't know that I was dealing with a reporter' said Mr. Wontner.\r\n\r\nWe were all halted outside a shut door. Ipps had followed us.\r\n\r\n'But surely you want it in the papers, don't you?' I urged. 'With a\r\nscandal like this, one couldn't, in justice to the democracy, be\r\nexclusive. We'd syndicate it here and in the United States. I helped you\r\nout of the sack, if you remember.'\r\n\r\n'I wish to goodness you'd stop talking!' he snapped, and sat down on a\r\nchair. Stalky's hand on my shoulder quietly signalled me out of action,\r\nbut I felt that my fire had not been misdirected.\r\n\r\n'I'll answer for him,' said Stalky to Wontner, in an undertone that\r\ndropped to a whisper. I caught--'Not without my leave--dependent on me\r\nfor market-tips,' and other gratifying tributes to my integrity.\r\n\r\nStill Mr. Wontner sat in his chair, and still we waited on him. The\r\nInfant's face showed worry and heavy grief; Stalky's, a bright and\r\nbird-like interest; mine was hidden behind his shoulders, but on the\r\nface of Ipps were written emotions that no butler should cherish towards\r\nany guest. Contempt and wrath were the least of them. And Mr. Wontner\r\nwas looking full at Ipps, as Ipps was looking at him. Mr. Wontner's\r\nfather, I understood, kept a butler and two footmen.\r\n\r\n'D'you suppose they're shamming, in order to get off?' he said at last.\r\nIpps shook his head and noiselessly threw the door open. The boys had\r\nfinished their dinner and were fast asleep--one on a sofa, one in a long\r\nchair--their faces fallen back to the lines of their childhood. They had\r\nhad a wildish night, a hard day, that ended with a telling-off from an\r\nartist, and the assurance they had wrecked their prospects for life.\r\nWhat else should youth do, then, but eat, and drink '81 port, and\r\nremember their sorrows no more?\r\n\r\nMr. Wontner looked at them severely, Ipps within easy reach, his hands\r\nquite ready. 'Childish,' said Mr. Wontner at last. 'Childish but\r\nnecessary. Er--have you such a thing as a rope on the premises, and a\r\nsack--two sacks and two ropes? I'm afraid I can't resist the temptation.\r\nThat man understands, doesn't he, that this is a private matter?'\r\n\r\n'That man,' who was me, was off to the basement like one of Infant's own\r\nfallow-deer. The stables gave me what I wanted, and coming back with it\r\nthrough a dark passage, I ran squarely into Ipps. 'Go on!' he grunted.\r\n'The minute he lays hands on Master Bobby, Master Bobby's saved. But\r\nthat person ought to be told how near he came to being assaulted. It was\r\ntouch-and-go with me all the time from the soup down, I assure you.'\r\n\r\nI arrived breathless with the sacks and the ropes. 'They were two to one\r\nwith me,' said Mr. Wontner, as he took them. 'If they wake--'\r\n\r\n'We'll stand by,' Stalky replied. 'Two to one is quite fair.'\r\n\r\nBut the boys hardly grunted as Mr. Wontner roped first one and then the\r\nother. Even when they were slid into the sacks they only mumbled, with\r\nrolling heads, through sticky lips, and snored on.\r\n\r\n'Port?' said Mr. Wontner virtuously.\r\n\r\n'Nervous exhaustion. They aren't much more than kids, after all. What's\r\nnext?' said Stalky.\r\n\r\n'I want to take 'em away with me, please.'\r\n\r\nStalky looked at him with respect.\r\n\r\n'I'll have my car round in five minutes,' said The Infant. 'Ipps'll help\r\ncarry 'em downstairs,' and he shook Mr. Wontner by the hand.\r\n\r\nWe were all perfectly serious till the two bundles were dumped on a\r\ndivan in the hall, and the boys waked and began to realise what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\n'Yah!' said Mr. Wontner, with the simplicity of twelve years old. 'Who's\r\nscored now?' And he sat upon them. The tension broke in a storm of\r\nlaughter, led, I think, by Ipps.\r\n\r\n'Asinine--absolutely asinine!' said Mr. Wontner, with folded arms from\r\nhis lively chair. But he drank in the flattery and the fellowship of it\r\nall with quite a brainless grin, as we rolled and stamped round him, and\r\nwiped the tears from our cheeks.\r\n\r\n'Hang it!' said Bobby Trivett. 'We're defeated!'\r\n\r\n'By tactics, too,' said Eames. 'I didn't think you knew 'em, Clausewitz.\r\nIt's a fair score. What are you going to do with us?'\r\n\r\n'Take you back to Mess,' said Mr. Wontner.\r\n\r\n'Not like this?'\r\n\r\n'Oh no. Worse--much worse! I haven't begun with you yet. And you\r\nthought you'd scored! Yah!'\r\n\r\nThey had scored beyond their wildest dream. The man in whose hands it\r\nlay to shame them, their Colonel, their Adjutant, their Regiment, and\r\ntheir Service, had cast away all shadow of his legal rights for the sake\r\nof a common or bear-garden rag--such a rag as if it came to the ears of\r\nthe authorities, would cost him his commission. They were saved, and\r\ntheir saviour was their equal and their brother. So they chaffed and\r\nreviled him as such till he again squashed the breath out of them, and\r\nwe others laughed louder than they.\r\n\r\n'Fall in!' said Stalky when the limousine came round. 'This is the score\r\nof the century. I wouldn't miss it for a brigade! We shan't be\r\nlong, Infant!'\r\n\r\nI hurried into a coat.\r\n\r\n'Is there any necessity for that reporter-chap to come too?' said Mr.\r\nWontner in an unguarded whisper. 'He isn't dressed for one thing.'\r\n\r\nBobby and Eames wriggled round to look at the reporter, began a joyous\r\nbellow, and suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\n'What's the matter?' said Wontner with suspicion.\r\n\r\n'Nothing,' said Bobby. 'I die happy, Clausewitz. Take me up tenderly.'\r\n\r\nWe packed into the car, bearing our sheaves with us, and for half an\r\nhour, as the cool night-air fanned his thoughtful brow, Mr. Wontner was\r\nquite abreast of himself. Though he said nothing unworthy, he triumphed\r\nand trumpeted a little loudly over the sacks. I sat between them on the\r\nback seat, and applauded him servilely till he reminded me that what I\r\nhad seen and what he had said was not for publication. I hinted, while\r\nthe boys plunged with joy inside their trappings, that this might be a\r\nmatter for arrangement. 'Then a sovereign shan't part us,' said Mr.\r\nWontner cheerily, and both boys fell into lively hysterics. 'I don't see\r\nwhere the joke comes in for you,' said Mr. Wontner. 'I thought it was my\r\nlittle jokelet to-night.'\r\n\r\n'No, Clausewitz,' gasped Bobby. 'Some is, but not all. I'll be good now.\r\nI'll give you my parole till we get to Mess. I wouldn't be out of this\r\nfor a fiver.'\r\n\r\n'Nor me,' said Eames, and he gave his parole to attempt no escape or\r\nevasion.\r\n\r\n'Now, I suppose,' said Mr. Wontner largely to Stalky, as we neared the\r\nsuburbs of Ash, 'you have a good deal of practical joking on the Stock\r\nExchange, haven't you?'\r\n\r\n'And when were you on the Stock Exchange, Uncle Leonard?' piped Bobby,\r\nwhile Eames laid his sobbing head on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry,' said Stalky, 'but the fact is, I command a regiment myself\r\nwhen I'm at home. Your Colonel knows me, I think.' He gave his name. Mr.\r\nWontner seemed to have heard of it. We had to pick Eames off the floor,\r\nwhere he had cast himself from excess of delight.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Heavens!' said Mr. Wontner after a long pause. 'What have I done?\r\nWhat haven't I done?' We felt the temperature in the car rise as\r\nhe blushed.\r\n\r\n'You didn't talk tactics, Clausewitz?' said Bobby. 'Oh, say it wasn't\r\ntactics, darling!'\r\n\r\n'It was,' said Wontner.\r\n\r\nEames was all among our feet again, crying, 'If you don't let me get my\r\narms up, I'll be sick. Let's hear what you said. Tell us.'\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Wontner turned to Stalky. 'It's no good my begging your pardon,\r\nsir, I suppose,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Don't you notice 'em,' said Stalky. 'It was a fair rag all round, and\r\nanyhow, you two youngsters haven't any right to talk tactics. You've\r\nbeen rolled up, horse, foot, and guns.'\r\n\r\n'I'll make a treaty. If you'll let us go and change presently,' said\r\nBobby, 'I'll promise we won't tell about you, Clausewitz. _You_ talked\r\ntactics to Uncle Len? Old Dhurrah-bags will like that. He don't love\r\nyou, Claus.'\r\n\r\n'If I've made one ass of myself, I shall take extra care to make asses\r\nof you!' said Wontner. 'I want to stop, please, at the next milliner's\r\nshop on the right. It ought to be close here.'\r\n\r\nHe evidently knew the country even in the dark, for the car stopped at a\r\nbrilliantly-lighted millinery establishment, where--it was Saturday\r\nevening--a young lady was clearing up the counter. I followed him, as a\r\ngood reporter should.\r\n\r\n'Have you got--' he began. 'Ah, those'll do!' He pointed to two hairy\r\nplush beehive bonnets, one magenta, the other a conscientious electric\r\nblue. 'How much, please? I'll take them both, and that bunch of peacock\r\nfeathers, and that red feather thing.' It was a brilliant crimson-dyed\r\npigeon's wing.\r\n\r\n'Now I want some yards of muslin with a nice, fierce pattern, please.'\r\nHe got it--yellow with black tulips--and returned heavily laden.\r\n\r\n'Sorry to have kept you,' said he. 'Now we'll go to my quarters to\r\nchange and beautify.'\r\n\r\nWe came to them--opposite a dun waste of parade-ground that might have\r\nbeen Mian Mir--and bugles as they blew and drums as they rolled set\r\nheart-strings echoing.\r\n\r\nWe hoisted the boys out and arranged them on chairs, while Wontner\r\nchanged into uniform, but stopped when he saw me taking off my jacket.\r\n\r\n'What on earth's that for?' said he.\r\n\r\n'Because you've been wearing my evening things,' I said. 'I want to get\r\ninto 'em again, if you don't mind.'\r\n\r\n'Then you aren't a reporter?' he said.\r\n\r\n'No,' I said, 'but that shan't part us.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, hurry!' cried Eames in desperate convulsions. 'We can't stand this\r\nmuch longer. 'Tisn't fair on the young.'\r\n\r\n'I'll attend to you in good time,' said Wontner; and when he had made\r\ncareful toilet, he unwrapped the bonnets, put the peacock's feather into\r\nthe magenta one, pinned the crimson wing on the blue one, set them\r\ndaintily on the boys' heads, and bade them admire the effect in his\r\nshaving-glass while he ripped the muslin into lengths, bound it first,\r\nand draped it artistically afterwards a little below their knees. He\r\nfinished off with a gigantic sash-bow, obi fashion. 'Hobble skirts,' he\r\nexplained to Stalky, who nodded approval.\r\n\r\nNext he split open the bottom of each sack so that they could walk, but\r\nwith very short steps. 'I ought to have got you white satin slippers,'\r\nhe murmured, 'and I'm sorry there's no rouge.'\r\n\r\n'Don't worry on our account, old man--you're doing us proud,' said Bobby\r\nfrom under his hat. 'This beats milk-punch and mayonnaise.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, why didn't we think of these things when we had him at our mercy?'\r\nEames wailed. 'Never mind--we'll try it on the next chap. You've a\r\nmind, Claus.'\r\n\r\n'Now we'll call on 'em at Mess,' said Wontner, as they minced towards\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n'I think I'll call on your Colonel,' said Stalky. 'He oughtn't to miss\r\nthis. Your first attempt? I assure you I couldn't have done it better\r\nmyself. Thank you!' He held out his hand.\r\n\r\n'Thank _you_, sir!' said Wontner, shaking it. 'I'm more grateful to you\r\nthan I can say, and--and I'd like you to believe some time that I'm not\r\nquite as big a--'\r\n\r\n'Not in the least,' Stalky interrupted. 'If I were writing a\r\nconfidential report on you, I should put you down as rather adequate.\r\nLook after your geishas, or they'll fall!'\r\n\r\nWe watched the three cross the road and disappear into the shadow of the\r\nMess verandah. There was a noise. Then telephone bells rang, a sergeant\r\nand a Mess waiter charged out, and the noise grew, till at last the Mess\r\nwas a little noisy.\r\n\r\nWe came back, ten minutes later, with Colonel Dalziell, who had been\r\ntaking his sorrows to bed with him. The ante-room was quite full and\r\nvisitors were still arriving, but it was possible to hear oneself speak\r\noccasionally. Trivett and Eames, in sack and sash, sat side by side on a\r\ntable, their hats at a ravishing angle, coquettishly twiddling their\r\ntied feet. In the intervals of singing 'Put Me Among the Girls,' they\r\nsipped whisky-and-soda held to their lips by, I regret to say, a Major.\r\nPublic opinion seemed to be against allowing them to change their\r\ncostume till they should have danced in it. Wontner, lying more or less\r\ngracefully at the level of the chandelier in the arms of six subalterns,\r\nwas lecturing on tactics and imploring to be let down, which he was with\r\na run when they realised that the Colonel was there. Then he picked\r\nhimself up from the sofa and said: 'I want to apologise, sir, to you and\r\nthe Mess for having been such an ass ever since I joined!'\r\n\r\nThis was when the noise began.\r\n\r\nSeeing the night promised to be wet, Stalky and I went home again in The\r\nInfant's car. It was some time since we had tasted the hot air that lies\r\nbetween the cornice and the ceiling of crowded rooms.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour's silence, Stalky said to me: 'I don't know what\r\nyou've been doing, but I believe I've been weepin'. Would you put that\r\ndown to Burgundy or senile decay?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHILDREN\r\n\r\n     These were our children who died for our lands: they\r\n         were dear in our sight.\r\n       We have only the memory left of their home-treasured\r\n         sayings and laughter.\r\n       The price of our loss shall be paid to our hands, not\r\n         another's hereafter.\r\n     Neither the Alien nor Priest shall decide on it. That is our right.\r\n           _But who shall return us the children_?\r\n\r\n     At the hour the Barbarian chose to disclose his pretences,\r\n       And raged against Man, they engaged, on the breasts\r\n         that they bared for us,\r\n       The first felon-stroke of the sword he had long-time\r\n         prepared for us--\r\n     Their bodies were all our defence while we wrought our defences.\r\n\r\n     They bought us anew with their blood, forbearing to blame us,\r\n     Those hours which we had not made good when the Judgment\r\n          o'ercame us.\r\n     They believed us and perished for it. Our statecraft, our learning.\r\n\r\n     Delivered them bound to the Pit and alive to the burning\r\n     Whither they mirthfully hastened as jostling for honour.\r\n     Not since her birth has our Earth seen such worth loosed upon her.\r\n\r\n     Nor was their agony brief, or once only imposed on them.\r\n       The wounded, the war-spent, the sick received no exemption:\r\n       Being cured they returned and endured and achieved our redemption,\r\n     Hopeless themselves of relief, till Death, marvelling, closed\r\n          on them.\r\n\r\n     That flesh we had nursed from the first in all cleanness was given\r\n     To corruption unveiled and assailed by the malice of Heaven--\r\n     By the heart-shaking jests of Decay where it lolled on the wires--\r\n     To be blanched or gay-painted by fumes--to be cindered by fires--\r\n     To be senselessly tossed and retossed in stale mutilation\r\n     From crater to crater. For this we shall take expiation.\r\n         _But who shall return us our children_?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dog Hervey\r\n\r\n(April 1914)\r\n\r\nMy friend Attley, who would give away his own head if you told him you\r\nhad lost yours, was giving away a six-months-old litter of Bettina's\r\npups, and half-a-dozen women were in raptures at the show on\r\nMittleham lawn.\r\n\r\nWe picked by lot. Mrs. Godfrey drew first choice; her married daughter,\r\nsecond. I was third, but waived my right because I was already owned by\r\nMalachi, Bettina's full brother, whom I had brought over in the car to\r\nvisit his nephews and nieces, and he would have slain them all if I had\r\ntaken home one. Milly, Mrs. Godfrey's younger daughter, pounced on my\r\nrejection with squeals of delight, and Attley turned to a dark,\r\nsallow-skinned, slack-mouthed girl, who had come over for tennis, and\r\ninvited her to pick. She put on a pince-nez that made her look like a\r\ncamel, knelt clumsily, for she was long from the hip to the knee,\r\nbreathed hard, and considered the last couple.\r\n\r\n'I think I'd like that sandy-pied one,' she said.\r\n\r\n'Oh, not him, Miss Sichliffe!' Attley cried. 'He was overlaid or had\r\nsunstroke or something. They call him The Looney in the kennels.\r\nBesides, he squints.'\r\n\r\n'I think that's rather fetching,' she answered. Neither Malachi nor I\r\nhad ever seen a squinting dog before.\r\n\r\n'That's chorea--St. Vitus's dance,' Mrs. Godfrey put in. 'He ought to\r\nhave been drowned.'\r\n\r\n'But I like his cast of countenance,' the girl persisted.\r\n\r\n'He doesn't look a good life,' I said, 'but perhaps he can be patched\r\nup.' Miss Sichliffe turned crimson; I saw Mrs. Godfrey exchange a glance\r\nwith her married daughter, and knew I had said something which would\r\nhave to be lived down.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' Miss Sichliffe went on, her voice shaking, 'he isn't a good life,\r\nbut perhaps I can--patch him up. Come here, sir.' The misshapen beast\r\nlurched toward her, squinting down his own nose till he fell over his\r\nown toes. Then, luckily, Bettina ran across the lawn and reminded\r\nMalachi of their puppyhood. All that family are as queer as Dick's\r\nhatband, and fight like man and wife. I had to separate them, and Mrs.\r\nGodfrey helped me till they retired under the rhododendrons and had it\r\nout in silence.\r\n\r\n'D'you know what that girl's father was?' Mrs. Godfrey asked.\r\n\r\n'No,' I replied. 'I loathe her for her own sake. She breathes through\r\nher mouth.'\r\n\r\n'He was a retired doctor,' she explained. 'He used to pick up stormy\r\nyoung men in the repentant stage, take them home, and patch them up till\r\nthey were sound enough to be insured. Then he insured them heavily, and\r\nlet them out into the world again--with an appetite. Of course, no one\r\nknew him while he was alive, but he left pots of money to his daughter.'\r\n\r\n'Strictly legitimate--highly respectable,' I said. 'But what a life for\r\nthe daughter!'\r\n\r\n'Mustn't it have been! _Now_ d'you realise what you said just now?'\r\n\r\n'Perfectly; and now you've made me quite happy, shall we go back to the\r\nhouse?'\r\n\r\nWhen we reached it they were all inside, sitting in committee on names.\r\n\r\n'What shall you call yours?' I heard Milly ask Miss Sichliffe.\r\n\r\n'Harvey,' she replied--'Harvey's Sauce, you know. He's going to be quite\r\nsaucy when I've'--she saw Mrs. Godfrey and me coming through the French\r\nwindow--'when he's stronger.'\r\n\r\nAttley, the well-meaning man, to make me feel at ease, asked what I\r\nthought of the name.\r\n\r\n'Oh, splendid,' I said at random. 'H with an A, A with an R, R with a--'\r\n\r\n'But that's Little Bingo,' some one said, and they all laughed.\r\n\r\nMiss Sichliffe, her hands joined across her long knees, drawled, 'You\r\nought always to verify your quotations.'\r\n\r\nIt was not a kindly thrust, but something in the word 'quotation' set\r\nthe automatic side of my brain at work on some shadow of a word or\r\nphrase that kept itself out of memory's reach as a cat sits just beyond\r\na dog's jump. When I was going home, Miss Sichliffe came up to me in the\r\ntwilight, the pup on a leash, swinging her big shoes at the end of her\r\ntennis-racket.\r\n\r\n''Sorry,' she said in her thick schoolboy-like voice. 'I'm sorry for\r\nwhat I said to you about verifying quotations. I didn't know you well\r\nenough and--anyhow, I oughtn't to have.'\r\n\r\n'But you were quite right about Little Bingo,' I answered. 'The spelling\r\nought to have reminded me.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, of course. It's the spelling,' she said, and slouched off with the\r\npup sliding after her. Once again my brain began to worry after\r\nsomething that would have meant something if it had been properly\r\nspelled. I confided my trouble to Malachi on the way home, but Bettina\r\nhad bitten him in four places, and he was busy.\r\n\r\nWeeks later, Attley came over to see me, and before his car stopped\r\nMalachi let me know that Bettina was sitting beside the chauffeur. He\r\ngreeted her by the scruff of the neck as she hopped down; and I greeted\r\nMrs. Godfrey, Attley, and a big basket.\r\n\r\n'You've got to help me,' said Attley tiredly. We took the basket into\r\nthe garden, and there staggered out the angular shadow of a sandy-pied,\r\nbroken-haired terrier, with one imbecile and one delirious ear, and two\r\nmost hideous squints. Bettina and Malachi, already at grips on the lawn,\r\nsaw him, let go, and fled in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n'Why have you brought that fetid hound here?' I demanded.\r\n\r\n'Harvey? For you to take care of,' said Attley. 'He's had distemper, but\r\n_I_'m going abroad.'\r\n\r\n'Take him with you. I won't have him. He's mentally afflicted.'\r\n\r\n'Look here,' Attley almost shouted, 'do I strike you as a fool?'\r\n\r\n'Always,' said I.\r\n\r\n'Well, then, if you say so, and Ella says so, that proves I ought to go\r\nabroad.'\r\n\r\n'Will's wrong, quite wrong,' Mrs. Godfrey interrupted; 'but you must\r\ntake the pup.'\r\n\r\n'My dear boy, my dear boy, don't you ever give anything to a woman,'\r\nAttley snorted.\r\n\r\nBit by bit I got the story out of them in the quiet garden (never a sign\r\nfrom Bettina and Malachi), while Harvey stared me out of countenance,\r\nfirst with one cuttlefish eye and then with the other.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that, a month after Miss Sichliffe took him, the dog Harvey\r\ndeveloped distemper. Miss Sichliffe had nursed him herself for some\r\ntime; then she carried him in her arms the two miles to Mittleham, and\r\nwept--actually wept--at Attley's feet, saying that Harvey was all she\r\nhad or expected to have in this world, and Attley must cure him. Attley,\r\nbeing by wealth, position, and temperament guardian to all lame dogs,\r\nhad put everything aside for this unsavoury job, and, he asserted, Miss\r\nSichliffe had virtually lived with him ever since.\r\n\r\n'She went home at night, of course,' he exploded, 'but the rest of the\r\ntime she simply infested the premises. Goodness knows, I'm not\r\nparticular, but it was a scandal. Even the servants!... Three and four\r\ntimes a day, and notes in between, to know how the beast was. Hang it\r\nall, don't laugh! And wanting to send me flowers and goldfish. Do I look\r\nas if I wanted goldfish? Can't you two stop for a minute?' (Mrs. Godfrey\r\nand I were clinging to each other for support.) 'And it isn't as if I\r\nwas--was so alluring a personality, is it?'\r\n\r\nAttley commands more trust, goodwill, and affection than most men, for\r\nhe is that rare angel, an absolutely unselfish bachelor, content to be\r\nrun by contending syndicates of zealous friends. His situation seemed\r\ndesperate, and I told him so.\r\n\r\n'Instant flight is your only remedy,' was my verdict. I'll take care of\r\nboth your cars while you're away, and you can send me over all the\r\ngreenhouse fruit.'\r\n\r\n'But why should I be chased out of my house by a she-dromedary?' he\r\nwailed.\r\n\r\n'Oh, stop! Stop!' Mrs. Godfrey sobbed. 'You're both wrong. I admit\r\nyou're right, but I _know_ you're wrong.'\r\n\r\n'Three _and_ four times a day,' said Attley, with an awful countenance.\r\n'I'm not a vain man, but--look here, Ella, I'm not sensitive, I hope,\r\nbut if you persist in making a joke of it--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, be quiet!' she almost shrieked. 'D'you imagine for one instant that\r\nyour friends would ever let Mittleham pass out of their hands? I quite\r\nagree it is unseemly for a grown girl to come to Mittleham at all hours\r\nof the day and night--'\r\n\r\n'I told you she went home o' nights,' Attley growled.\r\n\r\n'Specially if she goes home o' nights. Oh, but think of the life she\r\nmust have led, Will!'\r\n\r\n'I'm not interfering with it; only she must leave me alone.'\r\n\r\n'She may want to patch you up and insure you,' I suggested.\r\n\r\n'D'you know what _you_ are?' Mrs. Godfrey turned on me with the smile I\r\nhave feared for the last quarter of a century. 'You're the nice, kind,\r\nwise, doggy friend. You don't know how wise and nice you are supposed to\r\nbe. Will has sent Harvey to you to complete the poor angel's\r\nconvalescence. You know all about dogs, or Will wouldn't have done it.\r\nHe's written her that. You're too far off for her to make daily calls on\r\nyou. P'r'aps she'll drop in two or three times a week, and write on\r\nother days. But it doesn't matter what she does, because you don't own\r\nMittleham, don't you see?'\r\n\r\nI told her I saw most clearly.\r\n\r\n'Oh, you'll get over that in a few days,' Mrs. Godfrey countered.\r\n'You're the sporting, responsible, doggy friend who--'\r\n\r\n'He used to look at me like that at first,' said Attley, with a visible\r\nshudder, 'but he gave it up after a bit. It's only because you're new\r\nto him.'\r\n\r\n'But, confound you! he's a ghoul--' I began.\r\n\r\n'And when he gets quite well, you'll send him back to her direct with\r\nyour love, and she'll give you some pretty four-tailed goldfish,' said\r\nMrs. Godfrey, rising. 'That's all settled. Car, please. We're going to\r\nBrighton to lunch together.'\r\n\r\nThey ran before I could get into my stride, so I told the dog Harvey\r\nwhat I thought of them and his mistress. He never shifted his position,\r\nbut stared at me, an intense, lopsided stare, eye after eye. Malachi\r\ncame along when he had seen his sister off, and from a distance\r\ncounselled me to drown the brute and consort with gentlemen again. But\r\nthe dog Harvey never even cocked his cockable ear.\r\n\r\nAnd so it continued as long as he was with me. Where I sat, he sat and\r\nstared; where I walked, he walked beside, head stiffly slewed over one\r\nshoulder in single-barrelled contemplation of me. He never gave tongue,\r\nnever closed in for a caress, seldom let me stir a step alone. And, to\r\nmy amazement, Malachi, who suffered no stranger to live within our\r\ngates, saw this gaunt, growing, green-eyed devil wipe him out of my\r\nservice and company without a whimper. Indeed, one would have said the\r\nsituation interested him, for he would meet us returning from grim walks\r\ntogether, and look alternately at Harvey and at me with the same\r\nquivering interest that he showed at the mouth of a rat-hole. Outside\r\nthese inspections, Malachi withdrew himself as only a dog or a\r\nwoman can.\r\n\r\nMiss Sichliffe came over after a few days (luckily I was out) with some\r\nelaborate story of paying calls in the neighbourhood. She sent me a note\r\nof thanks next day. I was reading it when Harvey and Malachi entered and\r\ndisposed themselves as usual, Harvey close up to stare at me, Malachi\r\nhalf under the sofa, watching us both. Out of curiosity I returned\r\nHarvey's stare, then pulled his lopsided head on to my knee, and took\r\nhis eye for several minutes. Now, in Malachi's eye I can see at any hour\r\nall that there is of the normal decent dog, flecked here and there with\r\nthat strained half-soul which man's love and association have added to\r\nhis nature. But with Harvey the eye was perplexed, as a tortured man's.\r\nOnly by looking far into its deeps could one make out the spirit of the\r\nproper animal, beclouded and cowering beneath some unfair burden.\r\n\r\nLeggatt, my chauffeur, came in for orders.\r\n\r\n'How d'you think Harvey's coming on?' I said, as I rubbed the brute's\r\ngulping neck. The vet had warned me of the possibilities of spinal\r\ntrouble following distemper.\r\n\r\n'He ain't _my_ fancy,' was the reply. 'But _I_ don't question his\r\ncomings and goings so long as I 'aven't to sit alone in a room\r\nwith him.'\r\n\r\n'Why? He's as meek as Moses,' I said.\r\n\r\n'He fair gives me the creeps. P'r'aps he'll go out in fits.'\r\n\r\nBut Harvey, as I wrote his mistress from time to time, throve, and when\r\nhe grew better, would play by himself grisly games of spying, walking\r\nup, hailing, and chasing another dog. From these he would break off of a\r\nsudden and return to his normal stiff gait, with the air of one who had\r\nforgotten some matter of life and death, which could be reached only by\r\nstaring at me. I left him one evening posturing with the unseen on the\r\nlawn, and went inside to finish some letters for the post. I must have\r\nbeen at work nearly an hour, for I was going to turn on the lights,\r\nwhen I felt there was somebody in the room whom, the short hairs at the\r\nback of my neck warned me, I was not in the least anxious to face. There\r\nwas a mirror on the wall. As I lifted my eyes to it I saw the dog Harvey\r\nreflected near the shadow by the closed door. He had reared himself\r\nfull-length on his hind legs, his head a little one side to clear a sofa\r\nbetween us, and he was looking at me. The face, with its knitted brows\r\nand drawn lips, was the face of a dog, but the look, for the fraction of\r\ntime that I caught it, was human--wholly and horribly human. When the\r\nblood in my body went forward again he had dropped to the floor, and was\r\nmerely studying me in his usual one-eyed fashion. Next day I returned\r\nhim to Miss Sichliffe. I would not have kept him another day for the\r\nwealth of Asia, or even Ella Godfrey's approval.\r\n\r\nMiss Sichliffe's house I discovered to be a mid-Victorian mansion of\r\npeculiar villainy even for its period, surrounded by gardens of\r\nconflicting colours, all dazzling with glass and fresh paint on\r\nironwork. Striped blinds, for it was a blazing autumn morning, covered\r\nmost of the windows, and a voice sang to the piano an almost forgotten\r\nsong of Jean Ingelow's--\r\n\r\n     Methought that the stars were blinking bright,\r\n       And the old brig's sails unfurled--\r\n\r\nDown came the loud pedal, and the unrestrained cry swelled out across a\r\nbed of tritomas consuming in their own fires--\r\n\r\n     When I said I will sail to my love this night\r\n       On the other side of the world.\r\n\r\nI have no music, but the voice drew. I waited till the end:\r\n\r\n     Oh, maid most dear, I am not here\r\n       I have no place apart--\r\n     No dwelling more on sea or shore,\r\n       But only in thy heart.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me a poor life that had no more than that to do at eleven\r\no'clock of a Tuesday forenoon. Then Miss Sichliffe suddenly lumbered\r\nthrough a French window in clumsy haste, her brows contracted against\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\n'Well?' she said, delivering the word like a spear-thrust, with the full\r\nweight of a body behind it.\r\n\r\n'I've brought Harvey back at last,' I replied. 'Here he is.'\r\n\r\nBut it was at me she looked, not at the dog who had cast himself at her\r\nfeet--looked as though she would have fished my soul out of my breast on\r\nthe instant.\r\n\r\n'Wha--what did you think of him? What did _you_ make of him?' she\r\npanted. I was too taken aback for the moment to reply. Her voice broke\r\nas she stooped to the dog at her knees. 'O Harvey, Harvey! You utterly\r\nworthless old devil!' she cried, and the dog cringed and abased himself\r\nin servility that one could scarcely bear to look upon. I made to go.\r\n\r\n'Oh, but please, you mustn't!' She tugged at the car's side. 'Wouldn't\r\nyou like some flowers or some orchids? We've really splendid orchids,\r\nand'--she clasped her hands--'there are Japanese goldfish--real\r\nJapanese goldfish, with four tails. If you don't care for 'em, perhaps\r\nyour friends or somebody--oh, please!'\r\n\r\nHarvey had recovered himself, and I realised that this woman beyond the\r\ndecencies was fawning on me as the dog had fawned on her.\r\n\r\n'Certainly,' I said, ashamed to meet her eye. 'I'm lunching at\r\nMittleham, but--'\r\n\r\n'There's plenty of time,' she entreated. 'What do _you_ think of\r\nHarvey?'\r\n\r\n'He's a queer beast,' I said, getting out. 'He does nothing but stare at\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'Does he stare at you all the time he's with you?'\r\n\r\n'Always. He's doing it now. Look!'\r\n\r\nWe had halted. Harvey had sat down, and was staring from one to the\r\nother with a weaving motion of the head.\r\n\r\n'He'll do that all day,' I said. 'What is it, Harvey?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, what _is_ it, Harvey?' she echoed. The dog's throat twitched, his\r\nbody stiffened and shook as though he were going to have a fit. Then he\r\ncame back with a visible wrench to his unwinking watch.\r\n\r\n'Always so?' she whispered.\r\n\r\n'Always,' I replied, and told her something of his life with me. She\r\nnodded once or twice, and in the end led me into the house.\r\n\r\nThere were unaging pitch-pine doors of Gothic design in it; there were\r\ninlaid marble mantel-pieces and cut-steel fenders; there were stupendous\r\nwall-papers, and octagonal, medallioned Wedgwood what-nots, and\r\nblack-and-gilt Austrian images holding candelabra, with every other\r\nrefinement that Art had achieved or wealth had bought between 1851 and\r\n1878. And everything reeked of varnish.\r\n\r\n'Now!' she opened a baize door, and pointed down a long corridor flanked\r\nwith more Gothic doors. 'This was where we used to--to patch 'em up.\r\nYou've heard of us. Mrs. Godfrey told you in the garden the day I got\r\nHarvey given me. I'--she drew in her breath--'I live here by myself, and\r\nI have a very large income. Come back, Harvey.'\r\n\r\nHe had tiptoed down the corridor, as rigid as ever, and was sitting\r\noutside one of the shut doors. 'Look here!' she said, and planted\r\nherself squarely in front of me. 'I tell you this because you--you've\r\npatched up Harvey, too. Now, I want you to remember that my name is\r\nMoira. Mother calls me Marjorie because it's more refined; but my real\r\nname is Moira, and I am in my thirty-fourth year.'\r\n\r\n'Very good,' I said. 'I'll remember all that.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you.' Then with a sudden swoop into the humility of an abashed\r\nboy--''Sorry if I haven't said the proper things. You see--there's\r\nHarvey looking at us again. Oh, I want to say--if ever you want anything\r\nin the way of orchids or goldfish or--or anything else that would be\r\nuseful to you, you've only to come to me for it. Under the will I'm\r\nperfectly independent, and we're a long-lived family, worse luck!' She\r\nlooked at me, and her face worked like glass behind driven flame. 'I may\r\nreasonably expect to live another fifty years,' she said.\r\n\r\n'Thank you, Miss Sichliffe,' I replied. 'If I want anything, you may be\r\nsure I'll come to you for it.' She nodded. 'Now I must get over to\r\nMittleham,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Attley will ask you all about this.' For the first time she laughed\r\naloud. 'I'm afraid I frightened him nearly out of the county. I didn't\r\nthink, of course. But I dare say he knows by this time he was wrong. Say\r\ngood-bye to Harvey.'\r\n\r\n'Good-bye, old man,' I said. 'Give me a farewell stare, so we shall know\r\neach other when we meet again.'\r\n\r\nThe dog looked up, then moved slowly toward me, and stood, head bowed to\r\nthe floor, shaking in every muscle as I patted him; and when I turned, I\r\nsaw him crawl back to her feet.\r\n\r\nThat was not a good preparation for the rampant boy-and-girl-dominated\r\nlunch at Mittleham, which, as usual, I found in possession of everybody\r\nexcept the owner.\r\n\r\n'But what did the dromedary say when you brought her beast back?' Attley\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n'The usual polite things,' I replied. 'I'm posing as the nice doggy\r\nfriend nowadays.'\r\n\r\n'I don't envy you. She's never darkened my doors, thank goodness, since\r\nI left Harvey at your place. I suppose she'll run about the county now\r\nswearing you cured him. That's a woman's idea of gratitude.' Attley\r\nseemed rather hurt, and Mrs. Godfrey laughed.\r\n\r\n'That proves you were right about Miss Sichliffe, Ella,' I said. 'She\r\nhad no designs on anybody.'\r\n\r\n'I'm always right in these matters. But didn't she even offer you a\r\ngoldfish?'\r\n\r\n'Not a thing,' said I. 'You know what an old maid's like where her\r\nprecious dog's concerned.' And though I have tried vainly to lie to Ella\r\nGodfrey for many years, I believe that in this case I succeeded.\r\n\r\nWhen I turned into our drive that evening, Leggatt observed half aloud:\r\n\r\n'I'm glad Zvengali's back where he belongs. It's time our Mike had a\r\nlook in.'\r\n\r\nSure enough, there was Malachi back again in spirit as well as flesh,\r\nbut still with that odd air of expectation he had picked up from Harvey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was in January that Attley wrote me that Mrs. Godfrey, wintering in\r\nMadeira with Milly, her unmarried daughter, had been attacked with\r\nsomething like enteric; that the hotel, anxious for its good name, had\r\nthrust them both out into a cottage annexe; that he was off with a\r\nnurse, and that I was not to leave England till I heard from him again.\r\nIn a week he wired that Milly was down as well, and that I must bring\r\nout two more nurses, with suitable delicacies.\r\n\r\nWithin seventeen hours I had got them all aboard the Cape boat, and had\r\nseen the women safely collapsed into sea-sickness. The next few weeks\r\nwere for me, as for the invalids, a low delirium, clouded with fantastic\r\nmemories of Portuguese officials trying to tax calves'-foot jelly;\r\nvoluble doctors insisting that true typhoid was unknown in the island;\r\nnurses who had to be exercised, taken out of themselves, and returned on\r\nthe tick of change of guard; night slides down glassy, cobbled streets,\r\nsmelling of sewage and flowers, between walls whose every stone and\r\npatch Attley and I knew; vigils in stucco verandahs, watching the curve\r\nand descent of great stars or drawing auguries from the break of dawn;\r\ninsane interludes of gambling at the local Casino, where we won heaps of\r\nunconsoling silver; blasts of steamers arriving and departing in the\r\nroads; help offered by total strangers, grabbed at or thrust aside; the\r\nlong nightmare crumbling back into sanity one forenoon under a\r\nvine-covered trellis, where Attley sat hugging a nurse, while the others\r\ndanced a noiseless, neat-footed breakdown never learned at the Middlesex\r\nHospital. At last, as the tension came out all over us in aches and\r\ntingles that we put down to the country wine, a vision of Mrs. Godfrey,\r\nher grey hair turned to spun-glass, but her eyes triumphant over the\r\nshadow of retreating death beneath them, with Milly, enormously grown,\r\nand clutching life back to her young breast, both stretched out on cane\r\nchairs, clamouring for food.\r\n\r\nIn this ungirt hour there imported himself into our life a\r\nyoungish-looking middle-aged man of the name of Shend, with a blurred\r\nface and deprecating eyes. He said he had gambled with me at the Casino,\r\nwhich was no recommendation, and I remember that he twice gave me a\r\nbasket of champagne and liqueur brandy for the invalids, which a sailor\r\nin a red-tasselled cap carried up to the cottage for me at 3 A.M. He\r\nturned out to be the son of some merchant prince in the oil and colour\r\nline, and the owner of a four-hundred-ton steam yacht, into which, at\r\nhis gentle insistence, we later shifted our camp, staff, and equipage,\r\nMilly weeping with delight to escape from the horrible cottage. There we\r\nlay off Funchal for weeks, while Shend did miracles of luxury and\r\nattendance through deputies, and never once asked how his guests were\r\nenjoying themselves. Indeed, for several days at a time we would see\r\nnothing of him. He was, he said, subject to malaria. Giving as they do\r\nwith both hands, I knew that Attley and Mrs. Godfrey could take nobly;\r\nbut I never met a man who so nobly gave and so nobly received thanks as\r\nShend did.\r\n\r\n'Tell us why you have been so unbelievably kind to us gipsies,' Mrs.\r\nGodfrey said to him one day on deck.\r\n\r\nHe looked up from a diagram of some Thames-mouth shoals which he was\r\nexplaining to me, and answered with his gentle smile:\r\n\r\n'I will. It's because it makes me happy--it makes me more than happy--to\r\nbe with you. It makes me comfortable. You know how selfish men are? If a\r\nman feels comfortable all over with certain people, he'll bore them to\r\ndeath, just like a dog. You always make me feel as if pleasant things\r\nwere going to happen to me.'\r\n\r\n'Haven't any ever happened before?' Milly asked.\r\n\r\n'This is the most pleasant thing that has happened to me in ever so many\r\nyears,' he replied. 'I feel like the man in the Bible, \"It's good for me\r\nto be here.\" Generally, I don't feel that it's good for me to be\r\nanywhere in particular.' Then, as one begging a favour. 'You'll let me\r\ncome home with you--in the same boat, I mean? I'd take you back in this\r\nthing of mine, and that would save you packing your trunks, but she's\r\ntoo lively for spring work across the Bay.'\r\n\r\nWe booked our berths, and when the time came, he wafted us and ours\r\naboard the Southampton mail-boat with the pomp of plenipotentiaries and\r\nthe precision of the Navy. Then he dismissed his yacht, and became an\r\ninconspicuous passenger in a cabin opposite to mine, on the port side.\r\n\r\nWe ran at once into early British spring weather, followed by sou'west\r\ngales. Mrs. Godfrey, Milly, and the nurses disappeared. Attley stood it\r\nout, visibly yellowing, till the next meal, and followed suit, and Shend\r\nand I had the little table all to ourselves. I found him even more\r\nattractive when the women were away. The natural sweetness of the man,\r\nhis voice, and bearing all fascinated me, and his knowledge of practical\r\nseamanship (he held an extra master's certificate) was a real joy. We\r\nsat long in the empty saloon and longer in the smoking-room, making\r\ndashes downstairs over slippery decks at the eleventh hour.\r\n\r\nIt was on Friday night, just as I was going to bed, that he came into my\r\ncabin, after cleaning his teeth, which he did half a dozen times a day.\r\n\r\n'I say,' he began hurriedly, 'do you mind if I come in here for a\r\nlittle? I'm a bit edgy.' I must have shown surprise. 'I'm ever so much\r\nbetter about liquor than I used to be, but--it's the whisky in the\r\nsuitcase that throws me. For God's sake, old man, don't go back on me\r\nto-night! Look at my hands!'\r\n\r\nThey were fairly jumping at the wrists. He sat down on a trunk that had\r\nslid out with the roll. We had reduced speed, and were surging in\r\nconfused seas that pounded on the black port-glasses. The night promised\r\nto be a pleasant one!\r\n\r\n'You understand, of course, don't you?' he chattered.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes,' I said cheerily; 'but how about--'\r\n\r\n'No, no; on no account the doctor. 'Tell a doctor, tell the whole ship.\r\nBesides, I've only got a touch of 'em. You'd never have guessed it,\r\nwould you? The tooth-wash does the trick. I'll give you the\r\nprescription.'\r\n\r\nI'll send a note to the doctor for a prescription, shall I?' I\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n'Right! I put myself unreservedly in your hands. 'Fact is, I always did.\r\nI said to myself--'sure I don't bore you?--the minute I saw you, I said,\r\n\"Thou art the man.\"' He repeated the phrase as he picked at his knees.\r\n'All the same, you can take it from me that the ewe-lamb business is a\r\nrotten bad one. I don't care how unfaithful the shepherd may be. Drunk\r\nor sober, 'tisn't cricket.'\r\n\r\nA surge of the trunk threw him across the cabin as the steward answered\r\nmy bell. I wrote my requisition to the doctor while Shend was struggling\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\n'What's wrong?' he began. 'Oh, I know. We're slowing for soundings off\r\nUshant. It's about time, too. You'd better ship the dead-lights when you\r\ncome back, Matchem. It'll save you waking us later. This sea's going to\r\nget up when the tide turns. That'll show you,' he said as the man left,\r\n'that I am to be trusted. You--you'll stop me if I say anything I\r\nshouldn't, won't you?'\r\n\r\n'Talk away,' I replied, 'if it makes you feel better.'\r\n\r\n'That's it; you've hit it exactly. You always make me feel better. I can\r\nrely on you. It's awkward soundings but you'll see me through it. We'll\r\ndefeat him yet.... I may be an utterly worthless devil, but I'm not a\r\nbrawler.... I told him so at breakfast. I said, \"Doctor, I detest\r\nbrawling, but if ever you allow that girl to be insulted again as\r\nClements insulted her, I will break your neck with my own hands.\" You\r\nthink I was right?'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely,' I agreed.\r\n\r\n'Then we needn't discuss the matter any further. That man was a murderer\r\nin intention--outside the law, you understand, as it was then. They've\r\nchanged it since--but he never deceived _me_. I told him so. I said to\r\nhim at the time, \"I don't know what price you're going to put on my\r\nhead, but if ever you allow Clements to insult her again, you'll never\r\nlive to claim it.\"'\r\n\r\n'And what did he do?' I asked, to carry on the conversation, for Matchem\r\nentered with the bromide.\r\n\r\n'Oh, crumpled up at once. 'Lead still going, Matchem?'\r\n\r\n'I 'aven't 'eard,' said that faithful servant of the Union-Castle\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\n'Quite right. Never alarm the passengers. Ship the dead-light, will\r\nyou?' Matchem shipped it, for we were rolling very heavily. There were\r\ntramplings and gull-like cries from on deck. Shend looked at me with a\r\nmariner's eye.\r\n\r\n'That's nothing,' he said protectingly.\r\n\r\n'Oh, it's all right for you,' I said, jumping at the idea. '_I_ haven't\r\nan extra master's certificate. I'm only a passenger. I confess it\r\nfunks me.'\r\n\r\nInstantly his whole bearing changed to answer the appeal.\r\n\r\n'My dear fellow, it's as simple as houses. We're hunting for sixty-five\r\nfathom water. Anything short of sixty, with a sou'west wind means--but\r\nI'll get my Channel Pilot out of my cabin and give you the general idea.\r\nI'm only too grateful to do anything to put your mind at ease.'\r\n\r\nAnd so, perhaps, for another hour--he declined the drink--Channel Pilot\r\nin hand, he navigated us round Ushant, and at my request up-channel to\r\nSouthampton, light by light, with explanations and reminiscences. I\r\nprofessed myself soothed at last, and suggested bed.\r\n\r\n'In a second,' said he. 'Now, you wouldn't think, would you'--he glanced\r\noff the book toward my wildly swaying dressing-gown on the door--'that\r\nI've been seeing things for the last half-hour? 'Fact is, I'm just on\r\nthe edge of 'em, skating on thin ice round the corner--nor'east as near\r\nas nothing--where that dog's looking at me.'\r\n\r\n'What's the dog like?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Ah, that _is_ comforting of you! Most men walk through 'em to show me\r\nthey aren't real. As if I didn't know! But _you're_ different. Anybody\r\ncould see that with half an eye.' He stiffened and pointed. 'Damn it\r\nall! The dog sees it too with half an--Why, he knows you! Knows you\r\nperfectly. D'you know _him_?'\r\n\r\n'How can I tell if he isn't real?' I insisted.\r\n\r\n'But you can! _You're_ all right. I saw that from the first. Don't go\r\nback on me now or I shall go to pieces like the _Drummond Castle_. I beg\r\nyour pardon, old man; but, you see, you _do_ know the dog. I'll prove\r\nit. What's that dog doing? Come on! _You_ know.' A tremor shook him, and\r\nhe put his hand on my knee, and whispered with great meaning: 'I'll\r\nletter or halve it with you. There! You begin.'\r\n\r\n'S,' said I to humour him, for a dog would most likely be standing or\r\nsitting, or may be scratching or sniffling or staring.\r\n\r\n'Q,' he went on, and I could feel the heat of his shaking hand.\r\n\r\n'U,' said I. There was no other letter possible; but I was shaking too.\r\n\r\n'I.'\r\n\r\n'N.'\r\n\r\n'T-i-n-g,' he ran out. 'There! That proves it. I knew you knew him. You\r\ndon't know what a relief that is. Between ourselves, old man, he--he's\r\nbeen turning up lately a--a damn sight more often than I cared for. And\r\na squinting dog--a dog that squints! I mean that's a bit _too_ much.\r\nEh? What?' He gulped and half rose, and I thought that the full tide of\r\ndelirium would be on him in another sentence.\r\n\r\n'Not a bit of it,' I said as a last chance, with my hand over the\r\nbellpush. 'Why, you've just proved that I know him; so there are two of\r\nus in the game, anyhow.'\r\n\r\n'By Jove! that _is_ an idea! Of course there are. I knew you'd see me\r\nthrough. We'll defeat them yet. Hi, pup!... He's gone. Absolutely\r\ndisappeared!' He sighed with relief, and I caught the lucky moment.\r\n\r\n'Good business! I expect he only came to have a look at me,' I said.\r\n'Now, get this drink down and turn in to the lower bunk.'\r\n\r\nHe obeyed, protesting that he could not inconvenience me, and in the\r\nmidst of apologies sank into a dead sleep. I expected a wakeful night,\r\nhaving a certain amount to think over; but no sooner had I scrambled\r\ninto the top bunk than sleep came on me like a wave from the other side\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nIn the morning there were apologies, which we got over at breakfast\r\nbefore our party were about.\r\n\r\n'I suppose--after this--well, I don't blame you. I'm rather a lonely\r\nchap, though.' His eyes lifted dog-like across the table.\r\n\r\n'Shend,' I replied, 'I'm not running a Sunday school. You're coming home\r\nwith me in my car as soon as we land.'\r\n\r\n'That is kind of you--kinder than you think.'\r\n\r\n'That's because you're a little jumpy still. Now, I don't want to mix\r\nup in your private affairs--'\r\n\r\n'But I'd like you to,' he interrupted.\r\n\r\n'Then, would you mind telling me the Christian name of a girl who was\r\ninsulted by a man called Clements?'\r\n\r\n'Moira,' he whispered; and just then Mrs. Godfrey and Milly came to\r\ntable with their shore-going hats on.\r\n\r\nWe did not tie up till noon, but the faithful Leggatt had intrigued his\r\nway down to the dock-edge, and beside him sat Malachi, wearing his\r\ncollar of gold, or Leggatt makes it look so, as eloquent as Demosthenes.\r\nShend flinched a little when he saw him. We packed Mrs. Godfrey and\r\nMilly into Attley's car--they were going with him to Mittleham, of\r\ncourse--and drew clear across the railway lines to find England all lit\r\nand perfumed for spring. Shend sighed with happiness.\r\n\r\n'D'you know,' he said, 'if--if you'd chucked me--I should have gone down\r\nto my cabin after breakfast and cut my throat. And now--it's like a\r\ndream--a good dream, you know.'\r\n\r\nWe lunched with the other three at Romsey. Then I sat in front for a\r\nlittle while to talk to my Malachi. When I looked back, Shend was\r\nsolidly asleep, and stayed so for the next two hours, while Leggatt\r\nchased Attley's fat Daimler along the green-speckled hedges. He woke up\r\nwhen we said good-bye at Mittleham, with promises to meet again\r\nvery soon.\r\n\r\n'And I hope,' said Mrs. Godfrey, 'that everything pleasant will happen\r\nto you.'\r\n\r\n'Heaps and heaps--all at once,' cried long, weak Milly, waving her wet\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\n'I've just got to look in at a house near here for a minute to inquire\r\nabout a dog,' I said, 'and then we will go home.'\r\n\r\n'I used to know this part of the world,' he replied, and said no more\r\ntill Leggatt shot past the lodge at the Sichliffes's gate. Then I\r\nheard him gasp.\r\n\r\nMiss Sichliffe, in a green waterproof, an orange jersey, and a pinkish\r\nleather hat, was working on a bulb-border. She straightened herself as\r\nthe car stopped, and breathed hard. Shend got out and walked towards\r\nher. They shook hands, turned round together, and went into the house.\r\nThen the dog Harvey pranced out corkily from under the lee of a bench.\r\nMalachi, with one joyous swoop, fell on him as an enemy and an equal.\r\nHarvey, for his part, freed from all burden whatsoever except the\r\nobvious duty of a man-dog on his own ground, met Malachi without reserve\r\nor remorse, and with six months' additional growth to come and go on.\r\n\r\n'Don't check 'em!' cried Leggatt, dancing round the flurry. 'They've\r\nboth been saving up for each other all this time. It'll do 'em worlds\r\nof good.'\r\n\r\n'Leggatt,' I said, 'will you take Mr. Shend's bag and suitcase up to the\r\nhouse and put them down just inside the door? Then we will go on.'\r\n\r\nSo I enjoyed the finish alone. It was a dead heat, and they licked each\r\nother's jaws in amity till Harvey, one imploring eye on me, leaped into\r\nthe front seat, and Malachi backed his appeal. It was theft, but I took\r\nhim, and we talked all the way home of r-rats and r-rabbits and bones\r\nand baths and the other basic facts of life. That evening after dinner\r\nthey slept before the fire, with their warm chins across the hollows of\r\nmy ankles--to each chin an ankle--till I kicked them upstairs to bed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was not at Mittleham when she came over to announce her engagement,\r\nbut I heard of it when Mrs. Godfrey and Attley came, forty miles an\r\nhour, over to me, and Mrs. Godfrey called me names of the worst for\r\nsuppression of information.\r\n\r\n'As long as it wasn't me, I don't care,' said Attley.\r\n\r\n'I believe you knew it all along,' Mrs. Godfrey repeated. 'Else what\r\nmade you drive that man literally into her arms?'\r\n\r\n'To ask after the dog Harvey,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Then, what's the beast doing here?' Attley demanded, for Malachi and\r\nthe dog Harvey were deep in a council of the family with Bettina, who\r\nwas being out-argued.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Harvey seemed to think himself _de trop_ where he was,' I said.\r\n'And she hasn't sent after him. You'd better save Bettina before they\r\nkill her.'\r\n\r\n'There's been enough lying about that dog,' said Mrs. Godfrey to me. 'If\r\nhe wasn't born in lies, he was baptized in 'em. D'you know why she\r\ncalled him Harvey? It only occurred to me in those dreadful days when I\r\nwas ill, and one can't keep from thinking, and thinks everything. D'you\r\nknow your Boswell? What did Johnson say about Hervey--with an e?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, _that's_ it, is it?' I cried incautiously. 'That was why I ought to\r\nhave verified my quotations. The spelling defeated me. Wait a moment,\r\nand it will come back. Johnson said: \"He was a vicious man,\"' I began.\r\n\r\n'\"But very kind to me,\"' Mrs. Godfrey prompted. Then, both together,\r\n'\"If you call a dog Hervey, I shall love him.\"'\r\n\r\n'So you _were_ mixed up in it. At any rate, you had your suspicions from\r\nthe first? Tell me,' she said.\r\n\r\n'Ella,' I said, 'I don't know anything rational or reasonable about any\r\nof it. It was all--all woman-work, and it scared me horribly.'\r\n\r\n'Why?' she asked.\r\n\r\nThat was six years ago. I have written this tale to let her\r\nknow--wherever she may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMFORTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n     Until thy feet have trod the Road\r\n       Advise not wayside folk,\r\n     Nor till thy back has borne the Load\r\n       Break in upon the Broke.\r\n\r\n     Chase not with undesired largesse\r\n       Of sympathy the heart\r\n     Which, knowing her own bitterness,\r\n       Presumes to dwell apart.\r\n\r\n     Employ not that glad hand to raise\r\n       The God-forgotten head\r\n     To Heaven, and all the neighbours' gaze--\r\n       Cover thy mouth instead.\r\n\r\n     The quivering chin, the bitten lip,\r\n       The cold and sweating brow,\r\n     Later may yearn for fellowship--\r\n       Not now, you ass, not now!\r\n\r\n     Time, not thy ne'er so timely speech,\r\n       Life, not thy views thereon,\r\n     Shall furnish or deny to each\r\n       His consolation.\r\n\r\n     Or, if impelled to interfere,\r\n       Exhort, uplift, advise,\r\n     Lend not a base, betraying ear\r\n       To all the victim's cries.\r\n\r\n     Only the Lord can understand\r\n       When those first pangs begin,\r\n     How much is reflex action and\r\n       How much is really sin.\r\n\r\n     E'en from good words thyself refrain,\r\n       And tremblingly admit\r\n     There is no anodyne for pain\r\n       Except the shock of it.\r\n\r\n     So, when thine own dark hour shall fall,\r\n       Unchallenged canst thou say:\r\n     'I never worried _you_ at all,\r\n       For God's sake go away!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Village that Voted the Earth was Flat\r\n\r\n(1913)\r\n\r\n\r\nOur drive till then had been quite a success. The other men in the car\r\nwere my friend Woodhouse, young Ollyett, a distant connection of his,\r\nand Pallant, the M.P. Woodhouse's business was the treatment and cure of\r\nsick journals. He knew by instinct the precise moment in a newspaper's\r\nlife when the impetus of past good management is exhausted and it\r\nfetches up on the dead-centre between slow and expensive collapse and\r\nthe new start which can be given by gold injections--and genius. He was\r\nwisely ignorant of journalism; but when he stooped on a carcase there\r\nwas sure to be meat. He had that week added a half-dead, halfpenny\r\nevening paper to his collection, which consisted of a prosperous London\r\ndaily, one provincial ditto, and a limp-bodied weekly of commercial\r\nleanings. He had also, that very hour, planted me with a large block of\r\nthe evening paper's common shares, and was explaining the whole art of\r\neditorship to Ollyett, a young man three years from Oxford, with\r\ncoir-matting-coloured hair and a face harshly modelled by harsh\r\nexperiences, who, I understood, was assisting in the new venture.\r\nPallant, the long, wrinkled M.P., whose voice is more like a crane's\r\nthan a peacock's, took no shares, but gave us all advice.\r\n\r\n'You'll find it rather a knacker's yard,' Woodhouse was saying. 'Yes, I\r\nknow they call me The Knacker; but it will pay inside a year. All my\r\npapers do. I've only one motto: Back your luck and back your staff.\r\nIt'll come out all right.'\r\n\r\nThen the car stopped, and a policeman asked our names and addresses for\r\nexceeding the speed-limit. We pointed out that the road ran absolutely\r\nstraight for half a mile ahead without even a side-lane. 'That's just\r\nwhat we depend on,' said the policeman unpleasantly.\r\n\r\n'The usual swindle,' said Woodhouse under his breath. 'What's the name\r\nof this place?'\r\n\r\n'Huckley,' said the policeman. 'H-u-c-k-l-e-y,' and wrote something in\r\nhis note-book at which young Ollyett protested. A large red man on a\r\ngrey horse who had been watching us from the other side of the hedge\r\nshouted an order we could not catch. The policeman laid his hand on the\r\nrim of the right driving-door (Woodhouse carries his spare tyres aft),\r\nand it closed on the button of the electric horn. The grey horse at once\r\nbolted, and we could hear the rider swearing all across the landscape.\r\n\r\n'Damn it, man, you've got your silly fist on it! Take it off!' Woodhouse\r\nshouted.\r\n\r\n'Ho!' said the constable, looking carefully at his fingers as though we\r\nhad trapped them. 'That won't do you any good either,' and he wrote once\r\nmore in his note-book before he allowed us to go.\r\n\r\nThis was Woodhouse's first brush with motor law, and since I expected\r\nno ill consequences to myself, I pointed out that it was very serious. I\r\ntook the same view myself when in due time I found that I, too, was\r\nsummonsed on charges ranging from the use of obscene language to\r\nendangering traffic.\r\n\r\nJudgment was done in a little pale-yellow market-town with a small,\r\nJubilee clock-tower and a large corn-exchange. Woodhouse drove us there\r\nin his car. Pallant, who had not been included in the summons, came with\r\nus as moral support. While we waited outside, the fat man on the grey\r\nhorse rode up and entered into loud talk with his brother magistrates.\r\nHe said to one of them--for I took the trouble to note it down--'It\r\nfalls away from my lodge-gates, dead straight, three-quarters of a mile.\r\nI'd defy any one to resist it. We rooked seventy pounds out of 'em last\r\nmonth. No car can resist the temptation. You ought to have one your side\r\nthe county, Mike. They simply can't resist it.'\r\n\r\n'Whew!' said Woodhouse. 'We're in for trouble. Don't you say a word--or\r\nOllyett either! I'll pay the fines and we'll get it over as soon as\r\npossible. Where's Pallant?'\r\n\r\n'At the back of the court somewhere,' said Ollyett. 'I saw him slip in\r\njust now.'\r\n\r\nThe fat man then took his seat on the Bench, of which he was chairman,\r\nand I gathered from a bystander that his name was Sir Thomas Ingell,\r\nBart., M.P., of Ingell Park, Huckley. He began with an allocution\r\npitched in a tone that would have justified revolt throughout empires.\r\nEvidence, when the crowded little court did not drown it with applause,\r\nwas given in the pauses of the address. They were all very proud of\r\ntheir Sir Thomas, and looked from him to us, wondering why we did not\r\napplaud too.\r\n\r\nTaking its time from the chairman, the Bench rollicked with us for\r\nseventeen minutes. Sir Thomas explained that he was sick and tired of\r\nprocessions of cads of our type, who would be better employed breaking\r\nstones on the road than in frightening horses worth more than themselves\r\nor their ancestors. This was after it had been proved that Woodhouse's\r\nman had turned on the horn purposely to annoy Sir Thomas, who happened\r\nto be riding by'! There were other remarks too--primitive enough,--but\r\nit was the unspeakable brutality of the tone, even more than the quality\r\nof the justice, or the laughter of the audience that stung our souls out\r\nof all reason. When we were dismissed--to the tune of twenty-three\r\npounds, twelve shillings and sixpence--we waited for Pallant to join us,\r\nwhile we listened to the next case--one of driving without a licence.\r\nOllyett with an eye to his evening paper, had already taken very full\r\nnotes of our own, but we did not wish to seem prejudiced.\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' said the reporter of the local paper soothingly. 'We\r\nnever report Sir Thomas _in extenso_. Only the fines and charges.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, thank you,' Ollyett replied, and I heard him ask who every one in\r\ncourt might be. The local reporter was very communicative.\r\n\r\nThe new victim, a large, flaxen-haired man in somewhat striking\r\nclothes, to which Sir Thomas, now thoroughly warmed, drew public\r\nattention, said that he had left his licence at home. Sir Thomas asked\r\nhim if he expected the police to go to his home address at Jerusalem to\r\nfind it for him; and the court roared. Nor did Sir Thomas approve of the\r\nman's name, but insisted on calling him 'Mr. Masquerader,' and every\r\ntime he did so, all his people shouted. Evidently this was their\r\nestablished _auto-da-fé_.\r\n\r\n'He didn't summons me--because I'm in the House, I suppose. I think I\r\nshall have to ask a Question,' said Pallant, reappearing at the close\r\nof the case.\r\n\r\n'I think _I_ shall have to give it a little publicity too,' said\r\nWoodhouse. 'We can't have this kind of thing going on, you know.' His\r\nface was set and quite white. Pallant's, on the other hand, was black,\r\nand I know that my very stomach had turned with rage. Ollyett was dum.\r\n\r\n'Well, let's have lunch,' Woodhouse said at last. 'Then we can get away\r\nbefore the show breaks up.'\r\n\r\nWe drew Ollyett from the arms of the local reporter, crossed the Market\r\nSquare to the Red Lion and found Sir Thomas's 'Mr. Masquerader' just\r\nsitting down to beer, beef and pickles.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said he, in a large voice. 'Companions in misfortune. Won't you\r\ngentlemen join me?'\r\n\r\n'Delighted,' said Woodhouse. 'What did you get?'\r\n\r\n'I haven't decided. It might make a good turn, but--the public aren't\r\neducated up to it yet. It's beyond 'em. If it wasn't, that red dub on\r\nthe Bench would be worth fifty a week.'\r\n\r\n'Where?' said Woodhouse. The man looked at him with unaffected surprise.\r\n\r\n'At any one of My places,' he replied. 'But perhaps you live here?'\r\n\r\n'Good heavens!' cried young Ollyett suddenly. 'You _are_ Masquerier,\r\nthen? I thought you were!'\r\n\r\n'Bat Masquerier.' He let the words fall with the weight of an\r\ninternational ultimatum. 'Yes, that's all I am. But you have the\r\nadvantage of me, gentlemen.'\r\n\r\nFor the moment, while we were introducing ourselves, I was puzzled. Then\r\nI recalled prismatic music-hall posters--of enormous acreage--that had\r\nbeen the unnoticed background of my visits to London for years past.\r\nPosters of men and women, singers, jongleurs, impersonators and\r\naudacities of every draped and undraped brand, all moved on and off in\r\nLondon and the Provinces by Bat Masquerier--with the long wedge-tailed\r\nflourish following the final 'r.'\r\n\r\n'_I_ knew you at once,' said Pallant, the trained M.P., and I promptly\r\nbacked the lie. Woodhouse mumbled excuses. Bat Masquerier was not moved\r\nfor or against us any more than the frontage of one of his own palaces.\r\n\r\n'I always tell My people there's a limit to the size of the lettering,'\r\nhe said. 'Overdo that and the ret'na doesn't take it in. Advertisin' is\r\nthe most delicate of all the sciences.'\r\n\r\n'There's one man in the world who is going to get a little of it if I\r\nlive for the next twenty-four hours,' said Woodhouse, and explained how\r\nthis would come about.\r\n\r\nMasquerier stared at him lengthily with gunmetal-blue eyes.\r\n\r\n'You mean it?' he drawled; the voice was as magnetic as the look.\r\n\r\n'_I_ do,' said Ollyett. 'That business of the horn alone ought to have\r\nhim off the Bench in three months.' Masquerier looked at him even longer\r\nthan he had looked at Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n'He told _me_,' he said suddenly, 'that my home-address was Jerusalem.\r\nYou heard that?'\r\n\r\n'But it was the tone--the tone,' Ollyett cried.\r\n\r\n'You noticed that, too, did you?' said Masquerier. 'That's the artistic\r\ntemperament. You can do a lot with it. And I'm Bat Masquerier,' he went\r\non. He dropped his chin in his fists and scowled straight in front of\r\nhim.... 'I made the Silhouettes--I made the Trefoil and the Jocunda. I\r\nmade 'Dal Benzaguen.' Here Ollyett sat straight up, for in common with\r\nthe youth of that year he worshipped Miss Vidal Benzaguen of the Trefoil\r\nimmensely and unreservedly. '\"_Is_ that a dressing-gown or an ulster\r\nyou're supposed to be wearing?\" You heard _that_?... \"And I suppose you\r\nhadn't time to brush your hair either?\" You heard _that_?... Now, you\r\nhear _me_!' His voice filled the coffee-room, then dropped to a whisper\r\nas dreadful as a surgeon's before an operation. He spoke for several\r\nminutes. Pallant muttered 'Hear! hear!' I saw Ollyett's eye flash--it\r\nwas to Ollyett that Masquerier addressed himself chiefly,--and\r\nWoodhouse leaned forward with joined hands.\r\n\r\n'Are you _with_ me?' he went on, gathering us all up in one sweep of the\r\narm. 'When I begin a thing I see it through, gentlemen. What Bat can't\r\nbreak, breaks him! But I haven't struck that thing yet. This is no\r\none-turn turn-it-down show. This is business to the dead finish. Are you\r\nwith me, gentlemen? Good! Now, we'll pool our assets. One London\r\nmorning, and one provincial daily, didn't you say? One weekly commercial\r\nditto and one M.P.'\r\n\r\n'Not much use, I'm afraid,' Pallant smirked.\r\n\r\n'But privileged. _But_ privileged,' he returned. 'And we have also my\r\nlittle team--London, Blackburn, Liverpool, Leeds--I'll tell you about\r\nManchester later--and Me! Bat Masquerier.' He breathed the name\r\nreverently into his tankard. 'Gentlemen, when our combination has\r\nfinished with Sir Thomas Ingell, Bart., M.P., and everything else that\r\nis his, Sodom and Gomorrah will be a winsome bit of Merrie England\r\nbeside 'em. I must go back to town now, but I trust you gentlemen will\r\ngive me the pleasure of your company at dinner to-night at the Chop\r\nSuey--the Red Amber Room--and we'll block out the scenario.' He laid his\r\nhand on young Ollyett's shoulder and added: 'It's your brains I want.'\r\nThen he left, in a good deal of astrachan collar and nickel-plated\r\nlimousine, and the place felt less crowded.\r\n\r\nWe ordered our car a few minutes later. As Woodhouse, Ollyett and I were\r\ngetting in, Sir Thomas Ingell, Bart., M.P., came out of the Hall of\r\nJustice across the square and mounted his horse. I have sometimes\r\nthought that if he had gone in silence he might even then have been\r\nsaved, but as he settled himself in the saddle he caught sight of us and\r\nmust needs shout: 'Not off yet? You'd better get away and you'd better\r\nbe careful.' At that moment Pallant, who had been buying\r\npicture-postcards, came out of the inn, took Sir Thomas's eye and very\r\nleisurely entered the car. It seemed to me that for one instant there\r\nwas a shade of uneasiness on the baronet's grey-whiskered face.\r\n\r\n'I hope,' said Woodhouse after several miles, 'I hope he's a widower.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Pallant. 'For his poor, dear wife's sake I hope that, very\r\nmuch indeed. I suppose he didn't see me in Court. Oh, here's the parish\r\nhistory of Huckley written by the Rector and here's your share of the\r\npicture-postcards. Are we all dining with this Mr. Masquerier to-night?'\r\n\r\n'Yes!' said we all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf Woodhouse knew nothing of journalism, young Ollyett, who had\r\ngraduated in a hard school, knew a good deal. Our halfpenny evening\r\npaper, which we will call _The Bun_ to distinguish her from her\r\nprosperous morning sister, _The Cake_, was not only diseased but\r\ncorrupt. We found this out when a man brought us the prospectus of a new\r\noil-field and demanded sub-leaders on its prosperity. Ollyett talked\r\npure Brasenose to him for three minutes. Otherwise he spoke and wrote\r\ntrade-English--a toothsome amalgam of Americanisms and epigrams. But\r\nthough the slang changes the game never alters, and Ollyett and I and,\r\nin the end, some others enjoyed it immensely. It was weeks ere we could\r\nsee the wood for the trees, but so soon as the staff realised that they\r\nhad proprietors who backed them right or wrong, and specially when they\r\nwere wrong (which is the sole secret of journalism), and that their fate\r\ndid not hang on any passing owner's passing mood, they did miracles.\r\n\r\nBut we did not neglect Huckley. As Ollyett said our first care was to\r\ncreate an 'arresting atmosphere' round it. He used to visit the village\r\nof week-ends, on a motor-bicycle with a side-car; for which reason I\r\nleft the actual place alone and dealt with it in the abstract. Yet it\r\nwas I who drew first blood. Two inhabitants of Huckley wrote to\r\ncontradict a small, quite solid paragraph in _The Bun_ that a hoopoe had\r\nbeen seen at Huckley and had, 'of course, been shot by the local\r\nsportsmen.' There was some heat in their letters, both of which we\r\npublished. Our version of how the hoopoe got his crest from King Solomon\r\nwas, I grieve to say, so inaccurate that the Rector himself--no\r\nsportsman as he pointed out, but a lover of accuracy--wrote to us to\r\ncorrect it. We gave his letter good space and thanked him.\r\n\r\n'This priest is going to be useful,' said Ollyett. 'He has the impartial\r\nmind. I shall vitalise him.'\r\n\r\nForthwith he created M.L. Sigden, a recluse of refined tastes who in\r\n_The Bun_ demanded to know whether this Huckley-of-the-Hoopoe was the\r\nHugly of his boyhood and whether, by any chance, the fell change of name\r\nhad been wrought by collusion between a local magnate and the railway,\r\nin the mistaken interests of spurious refinement. 'For I knew it and\r\nloved it with the maidens of my day--_eheu ab angulo!_--as Hugly,' wrote\r\nM.L. Sigden from Oxf.\r\n\r\nThough other papers scoffed, _The Bun_ was gravely sympathetic. Several\r\npeople wrote to deny that Huckley had been changed at birth. Only the\r\nRector--no philosopher as he pointed out, but a lover of accuracy--had\r\nhis doubts, which he laid publicly before Mr. M.L. Sigden who suggested,\r\nthrough _The Bun_, that the little place might have begun life in\r\nAnglo-Saxon days as 'Hogslea' or among the Normans as 'Argilé,' on\r\naccount of its much clay. The Rector had his own ideas too (he said it\r\nwas mostly gravel), and M.L. Sigden had a fund of reminiscences. Oddly\r\nenough--which is seldom the case with free reading-matter--our\r\nsubscribers rather relished the correspondence, and contemporaries\r\nquoted freely.\r\n\r\n'The secret of power,' said Ollyett, 'is not the big stick. It's the\r\nliftable stick.' (This means the 'arresting' quotation of six or seven\r\nlines.) 'Did you see the _Spec._ had a middle on \"Rural Tenacities\" last\r\nweek. That was all Huckley. I'm doing a \"Mobiquity\" on Huckley\r\nnext week.'\r\n\r\nOur 'Mobiquities' were Friday evening accounts of easy\r\nmotor-bike-_cum_-side-car trips round London, illustrated (we could\r\nnever get that machine to work properly) by smudgy maps. Ollyett wrote\r\nthe stuff with a fervour and a delicacy which I always ascribed to the\r\nside-car. His account of Epping Forest, for instance, was simply young\r\nlove with its soul at its lips. But his Huckley 'Mobiquity' would have\r\nsickened a soap-boiler. It chemically combined loathsome familiarity,\r\nleering suggestion, slimy piety and rancid 'social service' in one\r\nfuming compost that fairly lifted me off my feet.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said he, after compliments. 'It's the most vital, arresting and\r\ndynamic bit of tump I've done up to date. _Non nobis gloria!_ I met Sir\r\nThomas Ingell in his own park. He talked to me again. He inspired\r\nmost of it.'\r\n\r\n'Which? The \"glutinous native drawl,\" or \"the neglected adenoids of the\r\nvillage children\"?' I demanded.\r\n\r\n'Oh, no! That's only to bring in the panel doctor. It's the last flight\r\nwe--I'm proudest of.'\r\n\r\nThis dealt with 'the crepuscular penumbra spreading her dim limbs over\r\nthe boskage'; with 'jolly rabbits'; with a herd of 'gravid polled\r\nAngus'; and with the 'arresting, gipsy-like face of their swart,\r\nscholarly owner--as well known at the Royal Agricultural Shows as that\r\nof our late King-Emperor.'\r\n\r\n'\"Swart\" is good and so's \"gravid,\"' said I, 'but the panel doctor will\r\nbe annoyed about the adenoids.'\r\n\r\n'Not half as much as Sir Thomas will about his face,' said Ollyett. 'And\r\nif you only knew what I've left out!'\r\n\r\nHe was right. The panel doctor spent his week-end (this is the\r\nadvantage of Friday articles) in overwhelming us with a professional\r\ncounterblast of no interest whatever to our subscribers. We told him so,\r\nand he, then and there, battered his way with it into the _Lancet_ where\r\nthey are keen on glands, and forgot us altogether. But Sir Thomas Ingell\r\nwas of sterner stuff. He must have spent a happy week-end too. The\r\nletter which we received from him on Monday proved him to be a kinless\r\nloon of upright life, for no woman, however remotely interested in a man\r\nwould have let it pass the home wastepaper-basket. He objected to our\r\nreferences to his own herd, to his own labours in his own village, which\r\nhe said was a Model Village, and to our infernal insolence; but he\r\nobjected most to our invoice of his features. We wrote him courtously to\r\nask whether the letter was meant for publication. He, remembering, I\r\npresume, the Duke of Wellington, wrote back, 'publish and be damned.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! This is too easy,' Ollyett said as he began heading the letter.\r\n\r\n'Stop a minute,' I said. 'The game is getting a little beyond us.\r\nTo-night's the Bat dinner.' (I may have forgotten to tell you that our\r\ndinner with Bat Masquerier in the Red Amber Room of the Chop Suey had\r\ncome to be a weekly affair.) 'Hold it over till they've all seen it.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps you're right,' he said. 'You might waste it.'\r\n\r\nAt dinner, then, Sir Thomas's letter was handed round. Bat seemed to be\r\nthinking of other matters, but Pallant was very interested.\r\n\r\n'I've got an idea,' he said presently. 'Could you put something into\r\n_The Bun_ to-morrow about foot-and-mouth disease in that fellow's herd?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, plague if you like,' Ollyett replied. 'They're only five measly\r\nShorthorns. I saw one lying down in the park. She'll serve as a\r\nsub-stratum of fact.'\r\n\r\n'Then, do that; and hold the letter over meanwhile. I think _I_ come in\r\nhere,' said Pallant.\r\n\r\n'Why?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Because there's something coming up in the House about foot-and-mouth,\r\nand because he wrote me a letter after that little affair when he fined\r\nyou. 'Took ten days to think it over. Here you are,' said Pallant.\r\n'House of Commons paper, you see.'\r\n\r\nWe read:\r\n\r\n     DEAR PALLANT--Although in the past our paths have not lain\r\n     much together, I am sure you will agree with me that on the\r\n     floor of the House all members are on a footing of equality.\r\n     I make bold, therefore, to approach you in a matter which I\r\n     think capable of a very different interpretation from that\r\n     which perhaps was put upon it by your friends. Will you let\r\n     them know that that was the case and that I was in no way\r\n     swayed by animus in the exercise of my magisterial duties,\r\n     which as you, as a brother magistrate, can imagine are\r\n     frequently very distasteful to--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n     T. INGELL.\r\n\r\n     _P.S._--I have seen to it that the motor vigilance to which\r\n     your friends took exception has been considerably relaxed in\r\n     my district.\r\n\r\n'What did you answer?' said Ollyett, when all our opinions had been\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\n'I told him I couldn't do anything in the matter. And I couldn't--then.\r\nBut you'll remember to put in that foot-and-mouth paragraph. I want\r\nsomething to work upon.'\r\n\r\n'It seems to me _The Bun_ has done all the work up to date,' I\r\nsuggested. 'When does _The Cake_ come in?'\r\n\r\n'_The Cake_,' said Woodhouse, and I remembered afterwards that he spoke\r\nlike a Cabinet Minister on the eve of a Budget, 'reserves to itself the\r\nfullest right to deal with situations as they arise.'\r\n\r\n'Ye-eh!' Bat Masquerier shook himself out of his thoughts. '\"Situations\r\nas they arise.\" I ain't idle either. But there's no use fishing till the\r\nswim's baited. You'--he turned to Ollyett--'manufacture very good\r\nground-bait.... I always tell My people--What the deuce is that?'\r\n\r\nThere was a burst of song from another private dining-room across the\r\nlanding. 'It ees some ladies from the Trefoil,' the waiter began.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I know that. What are they singing, though?'\r\n\r\nHe rose and went out, to be greeted by shouts of applause from that\r\nmerry company. Then there was silence, such as one hears in the\r\nform-room after a master's entry. Then a voice that we loved began\r\nagain: 'Here we go gathering nuts in May--nuts in May--nuts in May!'\r\n\r\n'It's only 'Dal--and some nuts,' he explained when he returned. 'She\r\nsays she's coming in to dessert.' He sat down, humming the old tune to\r\nhimself, and till Miss Vidal Benzaguen entered, he held us speechless\r\nwith tales of the artistic temperament.\r\n\r\nWe obeyed Pallant to the extent of slipping into _The Bun_ a wary\r\nparagraph about cows lying down and dripping at the mouth, which might\r\nbe read either as an unkind libel or, in the hands of a capable lawyer,\r\nas a piece of faithful nature-study.\r\n\r\n'And besides,' said Ollyett, 'we allude to \"gravid polled Angus.\" I am\r\nadvised that no action can lie in respect of virgin Shorthorns. Pallant\r\nwants us to come to the House to-night. He's got us places for the\r\nStrangers' Gallery. I'm beginning to like Pallant.'\r\n\r\n'Masquerier seems to like you,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Yes, but I'm afraid of him,' Ollyett answered with perfect sincerity.\r\n'I am. He's the Absolutely Amoral Soul. I've never met one yet.'\r\n\r\nWe went to the House together. It happened to be an Irish afternoon, and\r\nas soon as I had got the cries and the faces a little sorted out, I\r\ngathered there were grievances in the air, but how many of them was\r\nbeyond me.\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' said Ollyett of the trained ear. 'They've shut their\r\nports against--oh yes--export of Irish cattle! Foot-and-mouth disease at\r\nBallyhellion. _I_ see Pallant's idea!'\r\n\r\nThe House was certainly all mouth for the moment, but, as I could feel,\r\nquite in earnest. A Minister with a piece of typewritten paper seemed to\r\nbe fending off volleys of insults. He reminded me somehow of a nervous\r\nhuntsman breaking up a fox in the face of rabid hounds.\r\n\r\n'It's question-time. They're asking questions,' said Ollyett. 'Look!\r\nPallant's up.'\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking it. His voice, which his enemies said was his one\r\nparliamentary asset, silenced the hubbub as toothache silences mere\r\nsinging in the ears. He said:\r\n\r\n'Arising out of that, may I ask if any special consideration has\r\nrecently been shown in regard to any suspected outbreak of this disease\r\non _this_ side of the Channel?'\r\n\r\nHe raised his hand; it held a noon edition of _The Bun_. We had thought\r\nit best to drop the paragraph out of the later ones. He would have\r\ncontinued, but something in a grey frock-coat roared and bounded on a\r\nbench opposite, and waved another _Bun_. It was Sir Thomas Ingell.\r\n\r\n'As the owner of the herd so dastardly implicated--' His voice was\r\ndrowned in shouts of 'Order!'--the Irish leading.\r\n\r\n'What's wrong?' I asked Ollyett. 'He's got his hat on his head, hasn't\r\nhe?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but his wrath should have been put as a question.'\r\n\r\n'Arising out of that, Mr. Speaker, Sirrr!' Sir Thomas bellowed through a\r\nlull, 'are you aware that--that all this is a conspiracy--part of a\r\ndastardly conspiracy to make Huckley ridiculous--to make _us_\r\nridiculous? Part of a deep-laid plot to make _me_ ridiculous, Mr.\r\nSpeaker, Sir!'\r\n\r\nThe man's face showed almost black against his white whiskers, and he\r\nstruck out swimmingly with his arms. His vehemence puzzled and held the\r\nHouse for an instant, and the Speaker took advantage of it to lift his\r\npack from Ireland to a new scent. He addressed Sir Thomas Ingell in\r\ntones of measured rebuke, meant also, I imagine, for the whole House,\r\nwhich lowered its hackles at the word. Then Pallant, shocked and pained:\r\n'I can only express my profound surprise that in response to my simple\r\nquestion the honourable member should have thought fit to indulge in a\r\npersonal attack. If I have in any way offended--'\r\n\r\nAgain the Speaker intervened, for it appeared that he regulated these\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nHe, too, expressed surprise, and Sir Thomas sat back in a hush of\r\nreprobation that seemed to have the chill of the centuries behind it.\r\nThe Empire's work was resumed.\r\n\r\n'Beautiful!' said I, and I felt hot and cold up my back.\r\n\r\n'And now we'll publish his letter,' said Ollyett.\r\n\r\nWe did--on the heels of his carefully reported outburst. We made no\r\ncomment. With that rare instinct for grasping the heart of a situation\r\nwhich is the mark of the Anglo-Saxon, all our contemporaries and, I\r\nshould say, two-thirds of our correspondents demanded how such a person\r\ncould be made more ridiculous than he had already proved himself to be.\r\nBut beyond spelling his name 'Injle,' we alone refused to hit a man when\r\nhe was down.\r\n\r\n'There's no need,' said Ollyett. 'The whole press is on the huckle from\r\nend to end.'\r\n\r\nEven Woodhouse was a little astonished at the ease with which it had\r\ncome about, and said as much.\r\n\r\n'Rot!' said Ollyett. 'We haven't really begun. Huckley isn't news yet.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' said Woodhouse, who had grown to have great respect\r\nfor his young but by no means distant connection.\r\n\r\n'Mean? By the grace of God, Master Ridley, I mean to have it so that\r\nwhen Huckley turns over in its sleep, Reuters and the Press Association\r\njump out of bed to cable.' Then he went off at score about certain\r\nrestorations in Huckley Church which, he said--and he seemed to spend\r\nhis every week-end there--had been perpetrated by the Rector's\r\npredecessor, who had abolished a 'leper-window' or a 'squinch-hole'\r\n(whatever these may be) to institute a lavatory in the vestry. It did\r\nnot strike me as stuff for which Reuters or the Press Association would\r\nlose much sleep, and I left him declaiming to Woodhouse about a\r\nfourteenth-century font which, he said, he had unearthed in the sexton's\r\ntool-shed.\r\n\r\nMy methods were more on the lines of peaceful penetration. An odd copy,\r\nin _The Bun's_ rag-and-bone library, of Hone's _Every-Day Book_ had\r\nrevealed to me the existence of a village dance founded, like all\r\nvillage dances, on Druidical mysteries connected with the Solar Solstice\r\n(which is always unchallengeable) and Mid-summer Morning, which is dewy\r\nand refreshing to the London eye. For this I take no credit--Hone being\r\na mine any one can work--but that I rechristened that dance, after I\r\nhad revised it, 'The Gubby' is my title to immortal fame. It was still\r\nto be witnessed, I wrote, 'in all its poignant purity at Huckley, that\r\nlast home of significant mediæval survivals'; and I fell so in love with\r\nmy creation that I kept it back for days, enamelling and burnishing.\r\n\r\n'You's better put it in,' said Ollyett at last. 'It's time we asserted\r\nourselves again. The other fellows are beginning to poach. You saw that\r\nthing in the _Pinnacle_ about Sir Thomas's Model Village? He must have\r\ngot one of their chaps down to do it.'\r\n\r\n''Nothing like the wounds of a friend,' I said. 'That account of the\r\nnon-alcoholic pub alone was--'\r\n\r\n'I liked the bit best about the white-tiled laundry and the Fallen\r\nVirgins who wash Sir Thomas's dress shirts. Our side couldn't come\r\nwithin a mile of that, you know. We haven't the proper flair for\r\nsexual slobber.'\r\n\r\n'That's what I'm always saying,' I retorted. 'Leave 'em alone. The other\r\nfellows are doing our work for us now. Besides I want to touch up my\r\n\"Gubby Dance\" a little more.'\r\n\r\n'No. You'll spoil it. Let's shove it in to-day. For one thing it's\r\nLiterature. I don't go in for compliments as you know, but, etc. etc.'\r\n\r\nI had a healthy suspicion of young Ollyett in every aspect, but though I\r\nknew that I should have to pay for it, I fell to his flattery, and my\r\npriceless article on the 'Gubby Dance' appeared. Next Saturday he asked\r\nme to bring out _The Bun_ in his absence, which I naturally assumed\r\nwould be connected with the little maroon side-car. I was wrong.\r\n\r\nOn the following Monday I glanced at _The Cake_ at breakfast-time to\r\nmake sure, as usual, of her inferiority to my beloved but unremunerative\r\n_Bun_. I opened on a heading: 'The Village that Voted the Earth was\r\nFlat.' I read ... I read that the Geoplanarian Society--a society\r\ndevoted to the proposition that the earth is flat--had held its Annual\r\nBanquet and Exercises at Huckley on Saturday, when after convincing\r\naddresses, amid scenes of the greatest enthusiasm, Huckley village had\r\ndecided by an unanimous vote of 438 that the earth was flat. I do not\r\nremember that I breathed again till I had finished the two columns of\r\ndescription that followed. Only one man could have written them. They\r\nwere flawless--crisp, nervous, austere yet human, poignant, vital,\r\narresting--most distinctly arresting--dynamic enough to shift a\r\ncity--and quotable by whole sticks at a time. And there was a leader, a\r\ngrave and poised leader, which tore me in two with mirth, until I\r\nremembered that I had been left out--infamously and unjustifiably\r\ndropped. I went to Ollyett's rooms. He was breakfasting, and, to do him\r\njustice, looked conscience-stricken.\r\n\r\n'It wasn't my fault,' he began. 'It was Bat Masquerier. I swear _I_\r\nwould have asked you to come if--'\r\n\r\n'Never mind that,' I said. 'It's the best bit of work you've ever done\r\nor will do. Did any of it happen?'\r\n\r\n'Happen? Heavens! D'you think even _I_ could have invented it?'\r\n\r\n'Is it exclusive to _The Cake_?' I cried.\r\n\r\n'It cost Bat Masquerier two thousand,' Ollyett replied. 'D'you think\r\nhe'd let any one else in on that? But I give you my sacred word I knew\r\nnothing about it till he asked me to come down and cover it. He had\r\nHuckley posted in three colours, \"The Geoplanarians' Annual Banquet and\r\nExercises.\" Yes, he invented \"Geoplanarians.\" He wanted Huckley to think\r\nit meant aeroplanes. Yes, I know that there is a real Society that\r\nthinks the world's flat--they ought to be grateful for the lift--but Bat\r\nmade his own. He did! He created the whole show, I tell you. He swept\r\nout half his Halls for the job. Think of that--on a Saturday! They--we\r\nwent down in motor char-à-bancs--three of 'em--one pink, one primrose,\r\nand one forget-me-not blue--twenty people in each one and \"The Earth\r\n_is_ Flat\" on each side and across the back. I went with Teddy Rickets\r\nand Lafone from the Trefoil, and both the Silhouette Sisters, and--wait\r\na minute!--the Crossleigh Trio. You know the Every-Day Dramas Trio at\r\nthe Jocunda--Ada Crossleigh, \"Bunt\" Crossleigh, and little Victorine?\r\nThem. And there was Hoke Ramsden, the lightning-change chap in _Morgiana\r\nand Drexel_--and there was Billy Turpeen. Yes, you know him! The North\r\nLondon Star. \"I'm the Referee that got himself disliked at Blackheath.\"\r\n_That_ chap! And there was Mackaye--that one-eyed Scotch fellow that all\r\nGlasgow is crazy about. Talk of subordinating yourself for Art's sake!\r\nMackaye was the earnest inquirer who got converted at the end of the\r\nmeeting. And there was quite a lot of girls I didn't know, and--oh,\r\nyes--there was 'Dal! 'Dal Benzaguen herself! We sat together, going and\r\ncoming. She's all the darling there ever was. She sent you her love, and\r\nshe told me to tell you that she won't forget about Nellie Farren. She\r\nsays you've given her an ideal to work for. She? Oh, she was the Lady\r\nSecretary to the Geoplanarians, of course. I forget who were in the\r\nother brakes--provincial stars mostly--but they played up gorgeously.\r\nThe art of the music-hall's changed since your day. They didn't overdo\r\nit a bit. You see, people who believe the earth is flat don't dress\r\nquite like other people. You may have noticed that I hinted at that in\r\nmy account. It's a rather flat-fronted Ionic style--neo-Victorian,\r\nexcept for the bustles, 'Dal told me,--but 'Dal looked heavenly in it!\r\nSo did little Victorine. And there was a girl in the blue brake--she's a\r\nprovincial--but she's coming to town this winter and she'll knock\r\n'em--Winnie Deans. Remember that! She told Huckley how she had suffered\r\nfor the Cause as a governess in a rich family where they believed that\r\nthe world is round, and how she threw up her job sooner than teach\r\nimmoral geography. That was at the overflow meeting outside the\r\nBaptist chapel. She knocked 'em to sawdust! We must look out for\r\nWinnie.... But Lafone! Lafone was beyond everything. Impact,\r\npersonality--conviction--the whole bag o' tricks! He sweated conviction.\r\nGad, he convinced _me_ while he was speaking! (Him? He was President of\r\nthe Geoplanarians, of course. Haven't you read my account?) It _is_ an\r\ninfernally plausible theory. After all, no one has actually proved the\r\nearth is round, have they?'\r\n\r\n'Never mind the earth. What about Huckley?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Huckley got tight. That's the worst of these model villages if you\r\nlet 'em smell fire-water. There's one alcoholic pub in the place that\r\nSir Thomas can't get rid of. Bat made it his base. He sent down the\r\nbanquet in two motor lorries--dinner for five hundred and drinks for ten\r\nthousand. Huckley voted all right. Don't you make any mistake about\r\nthat. No vote, no dinner. A unanimous vote--exactly as I've said. At\r\nleast, the Rector and the Doctor were the only dissentients. We didn't\r\ncount them. Oh yes, Sir Thomas was there. He came and grinned at us\r\nthrough his park gates. He'll grin worse to-day. There's an aniline dye\r\nthat you rub through a stencil-plate that eats about a foot into any\r\nstone and wears good to the last. Bat had both the lodge-gates\r\nstencilled \"The Earth _is_ flat!\" and all the barns and walls they could\r\nget at.... Oh Lord, but Huckley was drunk! We had to fill 'em up to make\r\n'em forgive us for not being aeroplanes. Unthankful yokels! D'you\r\nrealise that Emperors couldn't have commanded the talent Bat decanted on\r\n'em? Why, 'Dal alone was.... And by eight o'clock not even a bit of\r\npaper left! The whole show packed up and gone, and Huckley hoo-raying\r\nfor the earth being flat.'\r\n\r\n'Very good,' I began. 'I am, as you know, a one-third proprietor of\r\n_The Bun_.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't forget that,' Ollyett interrupted. 'That was uppermost in my\r\nmind all the time. I've got a special account for _The Bun_ to-day--it's\r\nan idyll--and just to show how I thought of you, I told 'Dal, coming\r\nhome, about your Gubby Dance, and she told Winnie. Winnie came back in\r\nour char-à-banc. After a bit we had to get out and dance it in a field.\r\nIt's quite a dance the way we did it--and Lafone invented a sort of\r\ngorilla lockstep procession at the end. Bat had sent down a film-chap on\r\nthe chance of getting something. He was the son of a clergyman--a most\r\ndynamic personality. He said there isn't anything for the cinema in\r\nmeetings _qua_ meetings--they lack action. Films are a branch of art by\r\nthemselves. But he went wild over the Gubby. He said it was like Peter's\r\nvision at Joppa. He took about a million feet of it. Then I photoed it\r\nexclusive for _The Bun_. I've sent 'em in already, only remember we must\r\neliminate Winnie's left leg in the first figure. It's too arresting....\r\nAnd there you are! But I tell you I'm afraid of Bat. That man's the\r\nPersonal Devil. He did it all. He didn't even come down himself. He said\r\nhe'd distract his people.'\r\n\r\n'Why didn't he ask me to come?' I persisted.\r\n\r\n'Because he said you'd distract me. He said he wanted my brains on ice.\r\nHe got 'em. I believe it's the best thing I've ever done.' He reached\r\nfor _The Cake_ and re-read it luxuriously. 'Yes, out and away the\r\nbest--supremely quotable,' he concluded, and--after another survey--'By\r\nGod, what a genius I was yesterday!'\r\n\r\nI would have been angry, but I had not the time. That morning, Press\r\nagencies grovelled to me in _The Bun_ office for leave to use certain\r\nphotos, which, they understood, I controlled, of a certain village\r\ndance. When I had sent the fifth man away on the edge of tears, my\r\nself-respect came back a little. Then there was _The Bun's_ poster to\r\nget out. Art being elimination, I fined it down to two words (one too\r\nmany, as it proved)--'The Gubby!' in red, at which our manager\r\nprotested; but by five o'clock he told me that I was _the_ Napoleon of\r\nFleet Street. Ollyett's account in _The Bun_ of the Geoplanarians'\r\nExercises and Love Feast lacked the supreme shock of his version in _The\r\nCake_, but it bruised more; while the photos of 'The Gubby' (which, with\r\nWinnie's left leg, was why I had set the doubtful press to work so\r\nearly) were beyond praise and, next day, beyond price. But even then I\r\ndid not understand.\r\n\r\nA week later, I think it was, Bat Masquerier telephoned to me to come to\r\nthe Trefoil.\r\n\r\n'It's your turn now,' he said. 'I'm not asking Ollyett. Come to the\r\nstage-box.'\r\n\r\nI went, and, as Bat's guest, was received as Royalty is not. We sat well\r\nback and looked out on the packed thousands. It was _Morgiana and\r\nDrexel_, that fluid and electric review which Bat--though he gave Lafone\r\nthe credit--really created.\r\n\r\n'Ye-es,' said Bat dreamily, after Morgiana had given 'the nasty jar' to\r\nthe Forty Thieves in their forty oil 'combinations.' 'As you say, I've\r\ngot 'em and I can hold 'em. What a man does doesn't matter much; and how\r\nhe does it don't matter either. It's the _when_--the psychological\r\nmoment. 'Press can't make up for it; money can't; brains can't. A lot's\r\nluck, but all the rest is genius. I'm not speaking about My people now.\r\nI'm talking of Myself.'\r\n\r\nThen 'Dal--she was the only one who dared--knocked at the door and stood\r\nbehind us all alive and panting as Morgiana. Lafone was carrying the\r\npolice-court scene, and the house was ripped up crossways with laughter.\r\n\r\n'Ah! Tell a fellow now,' she asked me for the twentieth time, 'did you\r\nlove Nellie Farren when you were young?'\r\n\r\n'Did we love her?' I answered. '\"If the earth and the sky and the\r\nsea\"--There were three million of us, 'Dal, and we worshipped her.'\r\n\r\n'How did she get it across?' Dal went on.\r\n\r\n'She was Nellie. The houses used to coo over her when she came on.'\r\n\r\n'I've had a good deal, but I've never been cooed over yet,' said 'Dal\r\nwistfully.\r\n\r\n'It isn't the how, it's the when,' Bat repeated. 'Ah!'\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward as the house began to rock and peal full-throatedly.\r\n'Dal fled. A sinuous and silent procession was filing into the\r\npolice-court to a scarcely audible accompaniment. It was dressed--but\r\nthe world and all its picture-palaces know how it was dressed. It\r\ndanced and it danced, and it danced the dance which bit all humanity in\r\nthe leg for half a year, and it wound up with the lockstep finale that\r\nmowed the house down in swathes, sobbing and aching. Somebody in the\r\ngallery moaned, 'Oh Gord, the Gubby!' and we heard the word run like a\r\nshudder, for they had not a full breath left among them. Then 'Dal came\r\non, an electric star in her dark hair, the diamonds flashing in her\r\nthree-inch heels--a vision that made no sign for thirty counted seconds\r\nwhile the police-court scene dissolved behind her into Morgiana's\r\nManicure Palace, and they recovered themselves. The star on her forehead\r\nwent out, and a soft light bathed her as she took--slowly, slowly to the\r\ncroon of adoring strings--the eighteen paces forward. We saw her first\r\nas a queen alone; next as a queen for the first time conscious of her\r\nsubjects, and at the end, when her hands fluttered, as a woman\r\ndelighted, awed not a little, but transfigured and illuminated with\r\nsheer, compelling affection and goodwill. I caught the broken mutter of\r\nwelcome--the coo which is more than tornadoes of applause. It died and\r\nrose and died again lovingly.\r\n\r\n'She's got it across,' Bat whispered. 'I've never seen her like this. I\r\ntold her to light up the star, but I was wrong, and she knew it. She's\r\nan artist.'\r\n\r\n''Dal, you darling!' some one spoke, not loudly but it carried through\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n'Thank _you_!' 'Dal answered, and in that broken tone one heard the last\r\nfetter riveted. 'Good evening, boys! I've just come from--now--where the\r\ndooce was it I have come from?' She turned to the impassive files of\r\nthe Gubby dancers, and went on: 'Ah, so good of you to remind me, you\r\ndear, bun-faced things. I've just come from the village--The Village\r\nthat Voted the Earth was Flat.'\r\n\r\nShe swept into that song with the full orchestra. It devastated the\r\nhabitable earth for the next six months. Imagine, then, what its rage\r\nand pulse must have been at the incandescent hour of its birth! She only\r\ngave the chorus once. At the end of the second verse, 'Are you _with_\r\nme, boys?' she cried, and the house tore it clean away from\r\nher--'_Earth_ was flat--_Earth_ was flat. Flat as my hat--Flatter than\r\nthat'--drowning all but the bassoons and double-basses that marked\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\n'Wonderful,' I said to Bat. 'And it's only \"Nuts in May,\" with\r\nvariations.'\r\n\r\n'Yes--but _I_ did the variations,' he replied.\r\n\r\nAt the last verse she gestured to Carlini the conductor, who threw her\r\nup his baton. She caught it with a boy's ease. 'Are you _with_ me?' she\r\ncried once more, and--the maddened house behind her--abolished all the\r\ninstruments except the guttural belch of the double-basses on\r\n'_Earth_'--'The Village that voted the _Earth_ was flat--_Earth_ was\r\nflat!' It was delirium. Then she picked up the Gubby dancers and led\r\nthem in a clattering improvised lockstep thrice round the stage till her\r\nlast kick sent her diamond-hiked shoe catherine-wheeling to the\r\nelectrolier.\r\n\r\nI saw the forest of hands raised to catch it, heard the roaring and\r\nstamping pass through hurricanes to full typhoon; heard the song, pinned\r\ndown by the faithful double-basses as the bull-dog pins down the\r\nbellowing bull, overbear even those; till at last the curtain fell and\r\nBat took me round to her dressing-room, where she lay spent after her\r\nseventh call. Still the song, through all those white-washed walls,\r\nshook the reinforced concrete of the Trefoil as steam pile-drivers shake\r\nthe flanks of a dock.\r\n\r\n'I'm all out--first time in my life. Ah! Tell a fellow now, did I get it\r\nacross?' she whispered huskily.\r\n\r\n'You know you did,' I replied as she dipped her nose deep in a beaker of\r\nbarley-water. 'They cooed over you.'\r\n\r\nBat nodded. 'And poor Nellie's dead--in Africa, ain't it?'\r\n\r\n'I hope I'll die before they stop cooing,' said 'Dal.\r\n\r\n'\"_Earth_ was flat--_Earth_ was flat!\"' Now it was more like mine-pumps\r\nin flood.\r\n\r\n'They'll have the house down if you don't take another,' some one\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n'Bless 'em!' said 'Dal, and went out for her eighth, when in the face of\r\nthat cataract she said yawning, 'I don't know how _you_ feel, children,\r\nbut _I_'m dead. You be quiet.'\r\n\r\n'Hold a minute,' said Bat to me. 'I've got to hear how it went in the\r\nprovinces. Winnie Deans had it in Manchester, and Ramsden at\r\nGlasgow--and there are all the films too. I had rather a heavy\r\nweek-end.'\r\n\r\nThe telephones presently reassured him.\r\n\r\n'It'll do,' said he. 'And _he_ said my home address was Jerusalem.' He\r\nleft me humming the refrain of 'The Holy City.' Like Ollyett I found\r\nmyself afraid of that man.\r\n\r\nWhen I got out into the street and met the disgorging picture-palaces\r\ncapering on the pavements and humming it (for he had put the gramophones\r\non with the films), and when I saw far to the south the red electrics\r\nflash 'Gubby' across the Thames, I feared more than ever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few days passed which were like nothing except, perhaps, a suspense of\r\nfever in which the sick man perceives the searchlights of the world's\r\nassembled navies in act to converge on one minute fragment of\r\nwreckage--one only in all the black and agony-strewn sea. Then those\r\nbeams focussed themselves. Earth as we knew it--the full circuit of our\r\norb--laid the weight of its impersonal and searing curiosity on this\r\nHuckley which had voted that it was flat. It asked for news about\r\nHuckley--where and what it might be, and how it talked--it knew how it\r\ndanced--and how it thought in its wonderful soul. And then, in all the\r\nzealous, merciless press, Huckley was laid out for it to look at, as a\r\ndrop of pond water is exposed on the sheet of a magic-lantern show. But\r\nHuckley's sheet was only coterminous with the use of type among mankind.\r\nFor the precise moment that was necessary, Fate ruled it that there\r\nshould be nothing of first importance in the world's idle eye. One\r\natrocious murder, a political crisis, an incautious or heady\r\ncontinental statesman, the mere catarrh of a king, would have wiped out\r\nthe significance of our message, as a passing cloud annuls the urgent\r\nhelio. But it was halcyon weather in every respect. Ollyett and I did\r\nnot need to lift our little fingers any more than the Alpine climber\r\nwhose last sentence has unkeyed the arch of the avalanche. The thing\r\nroared and pulverised and swept beyond eyesight all by itself--all by\r\nitself. And once well away, the fall of kingdoms could not have\r\ndiverted it.\r\n\r\nOurs is, after all, a kindly earth. While The Song ran and raped it with\r\nthe cataleptic kick of 'Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay,' multiplied by the West\r\nAfrican significance of 'Everybody's doing it,' plus twice the infernal\r\nelementality of a certain tune in _Dona et Gamma_; when for all\r\npractical purposes, literary, dramatic, artistic, social, municipal,\r\npolitical, commercial, and administrative, the Earth _was_ flat, the\r\nRector of Huckley wrote to us--again as a lover of accuracy--to point\r\nout that the Huckley vote on 'the alleged flatness of this scene of our\r\nlabours here below' was _not_ unanimous; he and the doctor having voted\r\nagainst it. And the great Baron Reuter himself (I am sure it could have\r\nbeen none other) flashed that letter in full to the front, back, and\r\nboth wings of this scene of our labours. For Huckley was News. _The Bun_\r\nalso contributed a photograph which cost me some trouble to fake.\r\n\r\n'We are a vital nation,' said Ollyett while we were discussing affairs\r\nat a Bat dinner. 'Only an Englishman could have written that letter at\r\nthis present juncture.'\r\n\r\n'It reminded me of a tourist in the Cave of the Winds under Niagara.\r\nJust one figure in a mackintosh. But perhaps you saw our photo?' I\r\nsaid proudly.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' Bat replied. 'I've been to Niagara, too. And how's Huckley taking\r\nit?'\r\n\r\n'They don't quite understand, of course,' said Ollyett. 'But it's\r\nbringing pots of money into the place. Ever since the motor-bus\r\nexcursions were started--'\r\n\r\n'I didn't know they had been,' said Pallant.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes. Motor char-à-bancs--uniformed guides and key-bugles included.\r\nThey're getting a bit fed up with the tune there nowadays,'\r\nOllyett added.\r\n\r\n'They play it under his windows, don't they?' Bat asked. 'He can't stop\r\nthe right of way across his park.'\r\n\r\n'He cannot,' Ollyett answered. 'By the way, Woodhouse, I've bought that\r\nfont for you from the sexton. I paid fifteen pounds for it.'\r\n\r\n'What am I supposed to do with it?' asked Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n'You give it to the Victoria and Albert Museum. It is fourteenth-century\r\nwork all right. You can trust me.'\r\n\r\n'Is it worth it--now?' said Pallant. 'Not that I'm weakening, but merely\r\nas a matter of tactics?'\r\n\r\n'But this is true,' said Ollyett. 'Besides, it is my hobby, I always\r\nwanted to be an architect. I'll attend to it myself. It's too serious\r\nfor _The Bun_ and miles too good for _The Cake_.'\r\n\r\nHe broke ground in a ponderous architectural weekly, which had never\r\nheard of Huckley. There was no passion in his statement, but mere fact\r\nbacked by a wide range of authorities. He established beyond doubt that\r\nthe old font at Huckley had been thrown out, on Sir Thomas's\r\ninstigation, twenty years ago, to make room for a new one of Bath stone\r\nadorned with Limoges enamels; and that it had lain ever since in a\r\ncorner of the sexton's shed. He proved, with learned men to support him,\r\nthat there was only one other font in all England to compare with it. So\r\nWoodhouse bought it and presented it to a grateful South Kensington\r\nwhich said it would see the earth still flatter before it returned the\r\ntreasure to purblind Huckley. Bishops by the benchful and most of the\r\nRoyal Academy, not to mention 'Margaritas ante Porcos,' wrote fervently\r\nto the papers. _Punch_ based a political cartoon on it; the _Times_ a\r\nthird leader, 'The Lust of Newness'; and the _Spectator_ a scholarly and\r\ndelightful middle, 'Village Hausmania.' The vast amused outside world\r\nsaid in all its tongues and types: 'Of course! This is just what Huckley\r\nwould do!' And neither Sir Thomas nor the Rector nor the sexton nor any\r\none else wrote to deny it.\r\n\r\n'You see,' said Ollyett, 'this is much more of a blow to Huckley than it\r\nlooks--because every word of it's true. Your Gubby dance was\r\ninspiration, I admit, but it hadn't its roots in--'\r\n\r\n'Two hemispheres and four continents so far,' I pointed out.\r\n\r\n'Its roots in the hearts of Huckley was what I was going to say. Why\r\ndon't you ever come down and look at the place? You've never seen it\r\nsince we were stopped there.'\r\n\r\n'I've only my week-ends free,' I said, 'and you seem to spend yours\r\nthere pretty regularly--with the side-car. I was afraid--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, _that's_ all right,' he said cheerily. 'We're quite an old engaged\r\ncouple now. As a matter of fact, it happened after \"the gravid polled\r\nAngus\" business. Come along this Saturday. Woodhouse says he'll run us\r\ndown after lunch. He wants to see Huckley too.'\r\n\r\nPallant could not accompany us, but Bat took his place.\r\n\r\n'It's odd,' said Bat, 'that none of us except Ollyett has ever set eyes\r\non Huckley since that time. That's what I always tell My people. Local\r\ncolour is all right after you've got your idea. Before that, it's a mere\r\nnuisance.' He regaled us on the way down with panoramic views of the\r\nsuccess--geographical and financial--of 'The Gubby' and The Song.\r\n\r\n'By the way,' said he, 'I've assigned 'Dal all the gramophone rights of\r\n\"The Earth.\" She's a born artist. 'Hadn't sense enough to hit me for\r\ntriple-dubs the morning after. She'd have taken it out in coos.'\r\n\r\n'Bless her! And what'll she make out of the gramophone rights?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Lord knows!' he replied. 'I've made fifty-four thousand my little end\r\nof the business, and it's only just beginning. Hear _that_!'\r\n\r\nA shell-pink motor-brake roared up behind us to the music on a key-bugle\r\nof 'The Village that Voted the Earth was Flat.' In a few minutes we\r\novertook another, in natural wood, whose occupants were singing it\r\nthrough their noses.\r\n\r\n'I don't know that agency. It must be Cook's,' said Ollyett. 'They _do_\r\nsuffer.' We were never out of earshot of the tune the rest of the way\r\nto Huckley.\r\n\r\nThough I knew it would be so, I was disappointed with the actual aspect\r\nof the spot we had--it is not too much to say--created in the face of\r\nthe nations. The alcoholic pub; the village green; the Baptist chapel;\r\nthe church; the sexton's shed; the Rectory whence the so-wonderful\r\nletters had come; Sir Thomas's park gate-pillars still violently\r\ndeclaring 'The Earth _is_ flat,' were as mean, as average, as ordinary\r\nas the photograph of a room where a murder has been committed. Ollyett,\r\nwho, of course, knew the place specially well, made the most of it to\r\nus. Bat, who had employed it as a back-cloth to one of his own dramas,\r\ndismissed it as a thing used and emptied, but Woodhouse expressed my\r\nfeelings when he said: 'Is that all--after all we've done?'\r\n\r\n'_I_ know,' said Ollyett soothingly. '\"Like that strange song I heard\r\nApollo sing: When Ilion like a mist rose into towers.\" I've felt the\r\nsame sometimes, though it has been Paradise for me. But they\r\n_do_ suffer.'\r\n\r\nThe fourth brake in thirty minutes had just turned into Sir Thomas's\r\npark to tell the Hall that 'The _Earth_ was flat'; a knot of obviously\r\nAmerican tourists were kodaking his lodge-gates; while the tea-shop\r\nopposite the lych-gate was full of people buying postcards of the old\r\nfont as it had lain twenty years in the sexton's shed. We went to the\r\nalcoholic pub and congratulated the proprietor.\r\n\r\n'It's bringin' money to the place,' said he. 'But in a sense you can buy\r\nmoney too dear. It isn't doin' us any good. People are laughin' at us.\r\nThat's what they're doin'.... Now, with regard to that Vote of ours you\r\nmay have heard talk about....'\r\n\r\n'For Gorze sake, chuck that votin' business,' cried an elderly man at\r\nthe door. 'Money-gettin' or no money-gettin', we're fed up with it.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I do think,' said the publican, shifting his ground, 'I do think\r\nSir Thomas might ha' managed better in some things.'\r\n\r\n'He tole me,'--the elderly man shouldered his way to the bar--'he tole\r\nme twenty years ago to take an' lay that font in my tool-shed. He _tole_\r\nme so himself. An' now, after twenty years, me own wife makin' me out\r\nlittle better than the common 'angman!'\r\n\r\n'That's the sexton,' the publican explained. 'His good lady sells the\r\npostcards--if you 'aven't got some. But we feel Sir Thomas might ha'\r\ndone better.'\r\n\r\n'What's he got to do with it?' said Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n'There's nothin' we can trace 'ome to 'im in so many words, but we think\r\nhe might 'ave saved us the font business. Now, in regard to that votin'\r\nbusiness--'\r\n\r\n'Chuck it! Oh, chuck it!' the sexton roared, 'or you'll 'ave me cuttin'\r\nmy throat at cock-crow. 'Ere's another parcel of fun-makers!'\r\n\r\nA motor-brake had pulled up at the door and a multitude of men and\r\nwomen immediately descended. We went out to look. They bore rolled\r\nbanners, a reading-desk in three pieces, and, I specially noticed, a\r\ncollapsible harmonium, such as is used on ships at sea.\r\n\r\n'Salvation Army?' I said, though I saw no uniforms.\r\n\r\nTwo of them unfurled a banner between poles which bore the legend: 'The\r\nEarth _is_ flat.' Woodhouse and I turned to Bat. He shook his head. 'No,\r\nno! Not me.... If I had only seen their costumes in advance!'\r\n\r\n'Good Lord!' said Ollyett. 'It's the genuine Society!'\r\n\r\nThe company advanced on the green with the precision of people well\r\nbroke to these movements. Scene-shifters could not have been quicker\r\nwith the three-piece rostrum, nor stewards with the harmonium. Almost\r\nbefore its cross-legs had been kicked into their catches, certainly\r\nbefore the tourists by the lodge-gates had begun to move over, a woman\r\nsat down to it and struck up a hymn:\r\n\r\n     Hear ther truth our tongues are telling,\r\n       Spread ther light from shore to shore,\r\n     God hath given man a dwelling\r\n       Flat and flat for evermore.\r\n\r\n     When ther Primal Dark retreated,\r\n       When ther deeps were undesigned,\r\n     He with rule and level meted\r\n       Habitation for mankind!\r\n\r\nI saw sick envy on Bat's face. 'Curse Nature,' he muttered. 'She gets\r\nahead of you every time. To think _I_ forgot hymns and a harmonium!'\r\n\r\nThen came the chorus:\r\n\r\n     Hear ther truth our tongues are telling,\r\n       Spread ther light from shore to shore--\r\n     Oh, be faithful! Oh, be truthful!\r\n       Earth is flat for evermore.\r\n\r\nThey sang several verses with the fervour of Christians awaiting their\r\nlions. Then there were growlings in the air. The sexton, embraced by the\r\nlandlord, two-stepped out of the pub-door. Each was trying to outroar\r\nthe other. 'Apologising in advarnce for what he says,' the landlord\r\nshouted: 'You'd better go away' (here the sexton began to speak words).\r\n'This isn't the time nor yet the place for--for any more o' this chat.'\r\n\r\nThe crowd thickened. I saw the village police-sergeant come out of his\r\ncottage buckling his belt.\r\n\r\n'But surely,' said the woman at the harmonium, 'there must be some\r\nmistake. We are not suffragettes.'\r\n\r\n'Damn it! They'd be a change,' cried the sexton. 'You get out of this!\r\nDon't talk! _I_ can't stand it for one! Get right out, or we'll\r\nfont you!'\r\n\r\nThe crowd which was being recruited from every house in sight echoed the\r\ninvitation. The sergeant pushed forward. A man beside the reading-desk\r\nsaid: 'But surely we are among dear friends and sympathisers. Listen to\r\nme for a moment.'\r\n\r\nIt was the moment that a passing char-à-banc chose to strike into The\r\nSong. The effect was instantaneous. Bat, Ollyett, and I, who by divers\r\nroads have learned the psychology of crowds, retreated towards the\r\ntavern door. Woodhouse, the newspaper proprietor, anxious, I presume, to\r\nkeep touch with the public, dived into the thick of it. Every one else\r\ntold the Society to go away at once. When the lady at the harmonium (I\r\nbegan to understand why it is sometimes necessary to kill women) pointed\r\nat the stencilled park pillars and called them 'the cromlechs of our\r\ncommon faith,' there was a snarl and a rush. The police-sergeant checked\r\nit, but advised the Society to keep on going. The Society withdrew into\r\nthe brake fighting, as it were, a rear-guard action of oratory up each\r\nstep. The collapsed harmonium was hauled in last, and with the perfect\r\nunreason of crowds, they cheered it loudly, till the chauffeur slipped\r\nin his clutch and sped away. Then the crowd broke up, congratulating all\r\nconcerned except the sexton, who was held to have disgraced his office\r\nby having sworn at ladies. We strolled across the green towards\r\nWoodhouse, who was talking to the police-sergeant near the park-gates.\r\nWe were not twenty yards from him when we saw Sir Thomas Ingell emerge\r\nfrom the lodge and rush furiously at Woodhouse with an uplifted stick,\r\nat the same time shrieking: 'I'll teach you to laugh, you--' but Ollyett\r\nhas the record of the language. By the time we reached them, Sir Thomas\r\nwas on the ground; Woodhouse, very white, held the walking-stick and was\r\nsaying to the sergeant:\r\n\r\n'I give this person in charge for assault.'\r\n\r\n'But, good Lord!' said the sergeant, whiter than Woodhouse. 'It's Sir\r\nThomas.'\r\n\r\n'Whoever it is, it isn't fit to be at large,' said Woodhouse. The crowd\r\nsuspecting something wrong began to reassemble, and all the English\r\nhorror of a row in public moved us, headed by the sergeant, inside the\r\nlodge. We shut both park-gates and lodge-door.\r\n\r\n'You saw the assault, sergeant,' Woodhouse went on. 'You can testify I\r\nused no more force than was necessary to protect myself. You can testify\r\nthat I have not even damaged this person's property. (Here! take your\r\nstick, you!) You heard the filthy language he used.'\r\n\r\n'I--I can't say I did,' the sergeant stammered.\r\n\r\n'Oh, but _we_ did!' said Ollyett, and repeated it, to the apron-veiled\r\nhorror of the lodge-keeper's wife.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas on a hard kitchen chair began to talk. He said he had 'stood\r\nenough of being photographed like a wild beast,' and expressed loud\r\nregret that he had not killed 'that man,' who was 'conspiring with the\r\nsergeant to laugh at him.'\r\n\r\n''Ad you ever seen 'im before, Sir Thomas?' the sergeant asked.\r\n\r\n'No! But it's time an example was made here. I've never seen the sweep\r\nin my life.'\r\n\r\nI think it was Bat Masquerier's magnetic eye that recalled the past to\r\nhim, for his face changed and his jaw dropped. 'But I have!' he groaned.\r\n'I remember now.'\r\n\r\nHere a writhing man entered by the back door. He was, he said, the\r\nvillage solicitor. I do not assert that he licked Woodhouse's boots, but\r\nwe should have respected him more if he had and been done with it. His\r\nnotion was that the matter could be accommodated, arranged and\r\ncompromised for gold, and yet more gold. The sergeant thought so too.\r\nWoodhouse undeceived them both. To the sergeant he said, 'Will you or\r\nwill you not enter the charge?' To the village solicitor he gave the\r\nname of his lawyers, at which the man wrung his hands and cried, 'Oh,\r\nSir T., Sir T.!' in a miserable falsetto, for it was a Bat Masquerier of\r\na firm. They conferred together in tragic whispers.\r\n\r\n'I don't dive after Dickens,' said Ollyett to Bat and me by the window,\r\n'but every time _I_ get into a row I notice the police-court always\r\nfills up with his characters.'\r\n\r\n'I've noticed that too,' said Bat. 'But the odd thing is you mustn't\r\ngive the public straight Dickens--not in My business. I wonder why\r\nthat is.'\r\n\r\nThen Sir Thomas got his second wind and cursed the day that he, or it\r\nmay have been we, were born. I feared that though he was a Radical he\r\nmight apologise and, since he was an M.P., might lie his way out of the\r\ndifficulty. But he was utterly and truthfully beside himself. He asked\r\nfoolish questions--such as what we were doing in the village at all, and\r\nhow much blackmail Woodhouse expected to make out of him. But neither\r\nWoodhouse nor the sergeant nor the writhing solicitor listened. The\r\nupshot of their talk, in the chimney-corner, was that Sir Thomas stood\r\nengaged to appear next Monday before his brother magistrates on charges\r\nof assault, disorderly conduct, and language calculated, etc. Ollyett\r\nwas specially careful about the language.\r\n\r\nThen we left. The village looked very pretty in the late light--pretty\r\nand tuneful as a nest of nightingales.\r\n\r\n'You'll turn up on Monday, I hope,' said Woodhouse, when we reached\r\ntown. That was his only allusion to the affair.\r\n\r\nSo we turned up--through a world still singing that the Earth was\r\nflat--at the little clay-coloured market-town with the large Corn\r\nExchange and the small Jubilee memorial. We had some difficulty in\r\ngetting seats in the court. Woodhouse's imported London lawyer was a man\r\nof commanding personality, with a voice trained to convey blasting\r\nimputations by tone. When the case was called, he rose and stated his\r\nclient's intention not to proceed with the charge. His client, he went\r\non to say, had not entertained, and, of course, in the circumstances\r\ncould not have entertained, any suggestion of accepting on behalf of\r\npublic charities any moneys that might have been offered to him on the\r\npart of Sir Thomas's estate. At the same time, no one acknowledged more\r\nsincerely than his client the spirit in which those offers had been made\r\nby those entitled to make them. But, as a matter of fact--here he became\r\nthe man of the world colloguing with his equals--certain--er--details\r\nhad come to his client's knowledge _since_ the lamentable outburst,\r\nwhich ... He shrugged his shoulders. Nothing was served by going into\r\nthem, but he ventured to say that, had those painful circumstances only\r\nbeen known earlier, his client would--again 'of course'--never have\r\ndreamed--A gesture concluded the sentence, and the ensnared Bench looked\r\nat Sir Thomas with new and withdrawing eyes. Frankly, as they could see,\r\nit would be nothing less than cruelty to proceed further with\r\nthis--er-unfortunate affair. He asked leave, therefore, to withdraw the\r\ncharge _in toto_, and at the same time to express his client's deepest\r\nsympathy with all who had been in any way distressed, as his client had\r\nbeen, by the fact and the publicity of proceedings which he could, of\r\ncourse, again assure them that his client would never have dreamed of\r\ninstituting if, as he hoped he had made plain, certain facts had been\r\nbefore his client at the time when.... But he had said enough. For his\r\nfee it seemed to me that he had.\r\n\r\nHeaven inspired Sir Thomas's lawyer--all of a sweat lest his client's\r\nlanguage should come out--to rise up and thank him. Then, Sir\r\nThomas--not yet aware what leprosy had been laid upon him, but grateful\r\nto escape on any terms--followed suit. He was heard in interested\r\nsilence, and people drew back a pace as Gehazi passed forth.\r\n\r\n'You hit hard,' said Bat to Woodhouse afterwards. 'His own people think\r\nhe's mad.'\r\n\r\n'You don't say so? I'll show you some of his letters to-night at\r\ndinner,' he replied.\r\n\r\nHe brought them to the Red Amber Room of the Chop Suey. We forgot to be\r\namazed, as till then we had been amazed, over the Song or 'The Gubby,'\r\nor the full tide of Fate that seemed to run only for our sakes. It did\r\nnot even interest Ollyett that the verb 'to huckle' had passed into the\r\nEnglish leader-writers' language. We were studying the interior of a\r\nsoul, flash-lighted to its grimiest corners by the dread of 'losing its\r\nposition.'\r\n\r\n'And then it thanked you, didn't it, for dropping the case?' said\r\nPallant.\r\n\r\n'Yes, and it sent me a telegram to confirm.' Woodhouse turned to Bat.\r\n'Now d'you think I hit too hard?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'No-o!' said Bat. 'After all--I'm talking of every one's business\r\nnow--one can't ever do anything in Art that comes up to Nature in any\r\ngame in life. Just think how this thing has--'\r\n\r\n'Just let me run through that little case of yours again,' said Pallant,\r\nand picked up _The Bun_ which had it set out in full.\r\n\r\n'Any chance of 'Dal looking in on us to-night?' Ollyett began.\r\n\r\n'She's occupied with her Art too,' Bat answered bitterly. 'What's the\r\nuse of Art? Tell me, some one!' A barrel-organ outside promptly pointed\r\nout that the _Earth_ was flat. 'The gramophone's killing street organs,\r\nbut I let loose a hundred-and-seventy-four of those hurdygurdys twelve\r\nhours after The Song,' said Bat. 'Not counting the Provinces.' His face\r\nbrightened a little.\r\n\r\n'Look here!' said Pallant over the paper. 'I don't suppose you or those\r\nasinine J.P.'s knew it--but your lawyer ought to have known that you've\r\nall put your foot in it most confoundedly over this assault case.'\r\n\r\n'What's the matter?' said Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n'It's ludicrous. It's insane. There isn't two penn'orth of legality in\r\nthe whole thing. Of course, you could have withdrawn the charge, but the\r\nway you went about it is childish--besides being illegal. What on earth\r\nwas the Chief Constable thinking of?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, he was a friend of Sir Thomas's. They all were for that matter,' I\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n'He ought to be hanged. So ought the Chairman of the Bench. I'm talking\r\nas a lawyer now.'\r\n\r\n'Why, what have we been guilty of? Misprision of treason or compounding\r\na felony--or what?' said Ollyett.\r\n\r\n'I'll tell you later.' Pallant went back to the paper with knitted\r\nbrows, smiling unpleasantly from time to time. At last he laughed.\r\n\r\n'Thank you!' he said to Woodhouse. 'It ought to be pretty useful--for\r\nus.'\r\n\r\n'What d'you mean?' said Ollyett.\r\n\r\n'For our side. They are all Rads who are mixed up in this--from the\r\nChief Constable down. There must be a Question. There must be a\r\nQuestion.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but I wanted the charge withdrawn in my own way,' Woodhouse\r\ninsisted.\r\n\r\n'That's nothing to do with the case. It's the legality of your silly\r\nmethods. You wouldn't understand if I talked till morning,' He began to\r\npace the room, his hands behind him. 'I wonder if I can get it through\r\nour Whip's thick head that it's a chance.... That comes of stuffing the\r\nBench with radical tinkers,' he muttered.\r\n\r\n'Oh, sit down!' said Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n'Where's your lawyer to be found now?' he jerked out.\r\n\r\n'At the Trefoil,' said Bat promptly. 'I gave him the stage-box for\r\nto-night. He's an artist too.'\r\n\r\n'Then I'm going to see him,' said Pallant. 'Properly handled this ought\r\nto be a godsend for our side.' He withdrew without apology.\r\n\r\n'Certainly, this thing keeps on opening up, and up,' I remarked inanely.\r\n\r\n'It's beyond me!' said Bat. 'I don't think if I'd known I'd have\r\never ... Yes, I would, though. He said my home address was--'\r\n\r\n'It was his tone--his tone!' Ollyett almost shouted. Woodhouse said\r\nnothing, but his face whitened as he brooded.\r\n\r\n'Well, any way,' Bat went on, 'I'm glad I always believed in God and\r\nProvidence and all those things. Else I should lose my nerve. We've put\r\nit over the whole world--the full extent of the geographical globe. We\r\ncouldn't stop it if we wanted to now. It's got to burn itself out. I'm\r\nnot in charge any more. What d'you expect'll happen next. Angels?'\r\n\r\nI expected nothing. Nothing that I expected approached what I got.\r\nPolitics are not my concern, but, for the moment, since it seemed that\r\nthey were going to 'huckle' with the rest, I took an interest in them.\r\nThey impressed me as a dog's life without a dog's decencies, and I was\r\nconfirmed in this when an unshaven and unwashen Pallant called on me at\r\nten o'clock one morning, begging for a bath and a couch.\r\n\r\n'Bail too?' I asked. He was in evening dress and his eyes were sunk feet\r\nin his head.\r\n\r\n'No,' he said hoarsely. 'All night sitting. Fifteen divisions. 'Nother\r\nto-night. Your place was nearer than mine, so--' He began to undress\r\nin the hall.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke at one o'clock he gave me lurid accounts of what he said\r\nwas history, but which was obviously collective hysteria. There had been\r\na political crisis. He and his fellow M.P.'s had 'done things'--I never\r\nquite got at the things--for eighteen hours on end, and the pitiless\r\nWhips were even then at the telephones to herd 'em up to another\r\ndog-fight. So he snorted and grew hot all over again while he might have\r\nbeen resting.\r\n\r\n'I'm going to pitch in my question about that miscarriage of justice at\r\nHuckley this afternoon, if you care to listen to it,' he said. 'It'll be\r\nabsolutely thrown away--in our present state. I told 'em so; but it's my\r\nonly chance for weeks. P'raps Woodhouse would like to come.'\r\n\r\n'I'm sure he would. Anything to do with Huckley interests us,' I said.\r\n\r\n'It'll miss fire, I'm afraid. Both sides are absolutely cooked. The\r\npresent situation has been working up for some time. You see the row was\r\nbound to come, etc. etc.,' and he flew off the handle once more.\r\n\r\nI telephoned to Woodhouse, and we went to the House together. It was a\r\ndull, sticky afternoon with thunder in the air. For some reason or\r\nother, each side was determined to prove its virtue and endurance to the\r\nutmost. I heard men snarling about it all round me. 'If they won't spare\r\nus, we'll show 'em no mercy,' 'Break the brutes up from the start. They\r\ncan't stand late hours.' 'Come on! No shirking! I know _you've_ had a\r\nTurkish bath,' were some of the sentences I caught on our way. The House\r\nwas packed already, and one could feel the negative electricity of a\r\njaded crowd wrenching at one's own nerves, and depressing the\r\nafternoon soul.\r\n\r\n'This is bad!' Woodhouse whispered. 'There'll be a row before they've\r\nfinished. Look at the Front Benches!' And he pointed out little personal\r\nsigns by which I was to know that each man was on edge. He might have\r\nspared himself. The House was ready to snap before a bone had been\r\nthrown. A sullen minister rose to reply to a staccato question. His\r\nsupporters cheered defiantly. 'None o' that! None o' that!' came from\r\nthe Back Benches. I saw the Speaker's face stiffen like the face of a\r\nhelmsman as he humours a hard-mouthed yacht after a sudden following\r\nsea. The trouble was barely met in time. There came a fresh, apparently\r\ncauseless gust a few minutes later--savage, threatening, but futile. It\r\ndied out--one could hear the sigh--in sudden wrathful realisation of\r\nthe dreary hours ahead, and the ship of state drifted on.\r\n\r\nThen Pallant--and the raw House winced at the torture of his\r\nvoice--rose. It was a twenty-line question, studded with legal\r\ntechnicalities. The gist of it was that he wished to know whether the\r\nappropriate Minister was aware that there had been a grave miscarriage\r\nof justice on such and such a date, at such and such a place, before\r\nsuch and such justices of the peace, in regard to a case which arose--\r\n\r\nI heard one desperate, weary 'damn!' float up from the pit of that\r\ntorment. Pallant sawed on--'out of certain events which occurred at the\r\nvillage of Huckley.'\r\n\r\nThe House came to attention with a parting of the lips like a hiccough,\r\nand it flashed through my mind.... Pallant repeated, 'Huckley. The\r\nvillage--'\r\n\r\n'That voted the _Earth_ was flat.' A single voice from a back Bench sang\r\nit once like a lone frog in a far pool.\r\n\r\n'_Earth_ was flat,' croaked another voice opposite.\r\n\r\n'_Earth_ was flat.' There were several. Then several more.\r\n\r\nIt was, you understand, the collective, overstrained nerve of the House,\r\nsnapping, strand by strand to various notes, as the hawser parts from\r\nits moorings.\r\n\r\n'The Village that voted the _Earth_ was flat.' The tune was beginning to\r\nshape itself. More voices were raised and feet began to beat time. Even\r\nso it did not occur to me that the thing would--\r\n\r\n'The Village that voted the _Earth_ was flat!' It was easier now to see\r\nwho were not singing. There were still a few. Of a sudden (and this\r\nproves the fundamental instability of the cross-bench mind) a\r\ncross-bencher leaped on his seat and there played an imaginary\r\ndouble-bass with tremendous maestro-like wagglings of the elbow.\r\n\r\nThe last strand parted. The ship of state drifted out helpless on the\r\nrocking tide of melody.\r\n\r\n     'The Village that voted the _Earth_ was flat!\r\n      The Village that voted the _Earth_ was flat!'\r\n\r\nThe Irish first conceived the idea of using their order-papers as\r\nfunnels wherewith to reach the correct '_vroom--vroom_' on '_Earth_.'\r\nLabour, always conservative and respectable at a crisis, stood out\r\nlonger than any other section, but when it came in it was howling\r\nsyndicalism. Then, without distinction of Party, fear of constituents,\r\ndesire for office, or hope of emolument, the House sang at the tops and\r\nat the bottoms of their voices, swaying their stale bodies and\r\nepileptically beating with their swelled feet. They sang 'The Village\r\nthat voted the _Earth_ was flat': first, because they wanted to, and\r\nsecondly--which is the terror of that song--because they could not stop.\r\nFor no consideration could they stop.\r\n\r\nPallant was still standing up. Some one pointed at him and they laughed.\r\nOthers began to point, lunging, as it were, in time with the tune. At\r\nthis moment two persons came in practically abreast from behind the\r\nSpeaker's chair, and halted appalled. One happened to be the Prime\r\nMinister and the other a messenger. The House, with tears running down\r\ntheir cheeks, transferred their attention to the paralysed couple. They\r\npointed six hundred forefingers at them. They rocked, they waved, and\r\nthey rolled while they pointed, but still they sang. When they weakened\r\nfor an instant, Ireland would yell: 'Are ye _with_ me, bhoys?' and they\r\nall renewed their strength like Antaeus. No man could say afterwards\r\nwhat happened in the Press or the Strangers' Gallery. It was the House,\r\nthe hysterical and abandoned House of Commons that held all eyes, as it\r\ndeafened all ears. I saw both Front Benches bend forward, some with\r\ntheir foreheads on their despatch-boxes, the rest with their faces in\r\ntheir hands; and their moving shoulders jolted the House out of its last\r\nrag of decency. Only the Speaker remained unmoved. The entire press of\r\nGreat Britain bore witness next day that he had not even bowed his head.\r\nThe Angel of the Constitution, for vain was the help of man, foretold\r\nhim the exact moment at which the House would have broken into 'The\r\nGubby.' He is reported to have said: 'I heard the Irish beginning to\r\nshuffle it. So I adjourned.' Pallant's version is that he added: 'And I\r\nwas never so grateful to a private member in all my life as I was to\r\nMr. Pallant.'\r\n\r\nHe made no explanation. He did not refer to orders or disorders. He\r\nsimply adjourned the House till six that evening. And the House\r\nadjourned--some of it nearly on all fours.\r\n\r\nI was not correct when I said that the Speaker was the only man who did\r\nnot laugh. Woodhouse was beside me all the time. His face was set and\r\nquite white--as white, they told me, as Sir Thomas Ingell's when he\r\nwent, by request, to a private interview with his Chief Whip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESS\r\n\r\n     The Soldier may forget his sword\r\n       The Sailorman the sea,\r\n     The Mason may forget the Word\r\n       And the Priest his litany:\r\n     The maid may forget both jewel and gem,\r\n       And the bride her wedding-dress--\r\n     But the Jew shall forget Jerusalem\r\n       Ere we forget the Press!\r\n\r\n     Who once hath stood through the loaded hour\r\n       Ere, roaring like the gale,\r\n     The Harrild and the Hoe devour\r\n       Their league-long paper bale,\r\n     And has lit his pipe in the morning calm\r\n       That follows the midnight stress--\r\n     He hath sold his heart to the old Black Art\r\n       We call the daily Press.\r\n\r\n     Who once hath dealt in the widest game\r\n       That all of a man can play,\r\n     No later love, no larger fame\r\n       Will lure him long away.\r\n     As the war-horse smelleth the battle afar,\r\n       The entered Soul, no less,\r\n     He saith: 'Ha! Ha!' where the trumpets are\r\n       And the thunders of the Press.\r\n\r\n     Canst thou number the days that we fulfil,\r\n       Or the _Times_ that we bring forth?\r\n     Canst thou send the lightnings to do thy will,\r\n       And cause them reign on earth?\r\n     Hast thou given a peacock goodly wings\r\n       To please his foolishness?\r\n     Sit down at the heart of men and things,\r\n       Companion of the Press!\r\n\r\n     The Pope may launch his Interdict,\r\n       The Union its decree,\r\n     But the bubble is blown and the bubble is pricked\r\n       By Us and such as We.\r\n     Remember the battle and stand aside\r\n       While Thrones and Powers confess\r\n     That King over all the children of pride\r\n       Is the Press--the Press--the Press!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn The Presence\r\n\r\n(1912)\r\n\r\n'So the matter,' the Regimental Chaplain concluded, 'was correct; in\r\nevery way correct. I am well pleased with Rutton Singh and Attar Singh.\r\nThey have gathered the fruit of their lives.'\r\n\r\nHe folded his arms and sat down on the verandah. The hot day had ended,\r\nand there was a pleasant smell of cooking along the regimental lines,\r\nwhere half-clad men went back and forth with leaf platters and\r\nwater-goglets. The Subadar-Major, in extreme undress, sat on a chair, as\r\nbefitted his rank; the Havildar-Major, his nephew, leaning respectfully\r\nagainst the wall. The Regiment was at home and at ease in its own\r\nquarters in its own district which takes its name from the great\r\nMuhammadan saint Mian Mir, revered by Jehangir and beloved by Guru Har\r\nGobind, sixth of the great Sikh Gurus.\r\n\r\n'Quite correct,' the Regimental Chaplain repeated.\r\n\r\nNo Sikh contradicts his Regimental Chaplain who expounds to him the Holy\r\nBook of the Grunth Sahib and who knows the lives and legends of all\r\nthe Gurus.\r\n\r\nThe Subadar-Major bowed his grey head. The Havildar-Major coughed\r\nrespectfully to attract attention and to ask leave to speak. Though he\r\nwas the Subadar-Major's nephew, and though his father held twice as\r\nmuch land as his uncle, he knew his place in the scheme of things. The\r\nSubadar-Major shifted one hand with an iron bracelet on the wrist.\r\n\r\n'Was there by any chance any woman at the back of it?' the\r\nHavildar-Major murmured. 'I was not here when the thing happened.'\r\n\r\n'Yes! Yes! Yes! We all know that thou wast in England eating and\r\ndrinking with the Sahibs. We are all surprised that thou canst still\r\nspeak Punjabi.' The Subadar-Major's carefully-tended beard bristled.\r\n\r\n'There was no woman,' the Regimental Chaplain growled. 'It was land.\r\nHear, you! Rutton Singh and Attar Singh were the elder of four brothers.\r\nThese four held land in--what was the village's name?--oh, Pishapur,\r\nnear Thori, in the Banalu Tehsil of Patiala State, where men can still\r\nrecognise right behaviour when they see it. The two younger brothers\r\ntilled the land, while Rutton Singh and Attar Singh took service with\r\nthe Regiment, according to the custom of the family.'\r\n\r\n'True, true,' said the Havildar-Major. 'There is the same arrangement in\r\nall good families.'\r\n\r\n'Then, listen again,' the Regimental Chaplain went on. 'Their kin on\r\ntheir mother's side put great oppression and injustice upon the two\r\nyounger brothers who stayed with the land in Patiala State. Their\r\nmother's kin loosened beasts into the four brothers' crops when the\r\ncrops were green; they cut the corn by force when it was ripe; they\r\nbroke down the water-courses; they defiled the wells; and they brought\r\nfalse charges in the law-courts against all four brothers. They did not\r\nspare even the cotton-seed, as the saying is.\r\n\r\n'Their mother's kin trusted that the young men would thus be forced by\r\nweight of trouble, and further trouble and perpetual trouble, to quit\r\ntheir lands in Pishapur village in Banalu Tehsil in Patiala State. If\r\nthe young men ran away, the land would come whole to their mother's kin.\r\nI am not a regimental school-master, but is it understood, child?'\r\n\r\n'Understood,' said the Havildar-Major grimly. 'Pishapur is not the only\r\nplace where the fence eats the field instead of protecting it. But\r\nperhaps there was a woman among their mother's kin?'\r\n\r\n'God knows!' said the Regimental Chaplain. 'Woman, or man, or\r\nlaw-courts, the young men would _not_ be driven off the land which was\r\ntheir own by inheritance. They made appeal to Rutton Singh and Attar\r\nSingh, their brethren who had taken service with _us_ in the Regiment,\r\nand so knew the world, to help them in their long war against their\r\nmother's kin in Pishapur. For that reason, because their own land and\r\nthe honour of their house was dear to them, Rutton Singh and Attar Singh\r\nneeds must very often ask for leave to go to Patiala and attend to the\r\nlawsuits and cattle-poundings there.\r\n\r\n'It was not, look you, as though they went back to their own village and\r\nsat, garlanded with jasmine, in honour, upon chairs before the elders\r\nunder the trees. They went back always to perpetual trouble, either of\r\nlawsuits, or theft, or strayed cattle; and they sat on thorns.'\r\n\r\n'I knew it,' said the Subadar-Major. 'Life was bitter for them both. But\r\nthey were well-conducted men. It was not hard to get them their leave\r\nfrom the Colonel Sahib.'\r\n\r\n'They spoke to me also,' said the Chaplain. '_\"Let him who desires the\r\nfour great gifts apply himself to the words of holy men.\"_ That is\r\nwritten. Often they showed me the papers of the false lawsuits brought\r\nagainst them. Often they wept on account of the persecution put upon\r\nthem by their mother's kin. Men thought it was drugs when their eyes\r\nshowed red.'\r\n\r\n'They wept in my presence too,' said the Subadar-Major. 'Well-conducted\r\nmen of nine years' service apiece. Rutton Singh was drill-Naik, too.'\r\n\r\n'They did all things correctly as Sikhs should,' said the Regimental\r\nChaplain. 'When the persecution had endured seven years, Attar Singh\r\ntook leave to Pishapur once again (that was the fourth time in that year\r\nonly) and he called his persecutors together before the village elders,\r\nand he cast his turban at their feet and besought them by his mother's\r\nblood to cease from their persecutions. For he told them earnestly that\r\nhe had marched to the boundaries of his patience, and that there could\r\nbe but one end to the matter.\r\n\r\n'They gave him abuse. They mocked him and his tears, which was the same\r\nas though they had mocked the Regiment. Then Attar Singh returned to the\r\nRegiment, and laid this last trouble before Rutton Singh, the eldest\r\nbrother. But Rutton Singh could not get leave all at once.'\r\n\r\n'Because he was drill-Naik and the recruits were to be drilled. I myself\r\ntold him so,' said the Subadar-Major. 'He was a well-conducted man. He\r\nsaid he could wait.'\r\n\r\n'But when permission was granted, those two took four days' leave,' the\r\nChaplain went on.\r\n\r\n'I do not think Attar Singh should have taken Baynes Sahib's revolver.\r\nHe was Baynes Sahib's orderly, and all that Sahib's things were open to\r\nhim. It was, therefore, as I count it, shame to Attar Singh,' said the\r\nSubadar-Major.\r\n\r\n'All the words had been said. There was need of arms, and how could\r\nsoldiers use Government rifles upon mere cultivators in the fields?' the\r\nRegimental Chaplain replied. 'Moreover, the revolver was sent back,\r\ntogether with a money-order for the cartridges expended. _\"Borrow not;\r\nbut if thou borrowest, pay back soon!\"_ That is written in the Hymns.\r\nRutton Singh took a sword, and he and Attar Singh went to Pishapur and,\r\nafter word given, the four brethren fell upon their persecutors in\r\nPishapur village and slew seventeen, wounding ten. A revolver is better\r\nthan a lawsuit. I say that these four brethren, the two with _us_, and\r\nthe two mere cultivators, slew and wounded twenty-seven--all their\r\nmother's kin, male and female.\r\n\r\n'Then the four mounted to their housetop, and Attar Singh, who was\r\nalways one of the impetuous, said \"My work is done,\" and he made\r\n_shinan_ (purification) in all men's sight, and he lent Rutton Singh\r\nBaynes Sahib's revolver, and Rutton Singh shot him in the head.\r\n\r\n'So Attar Singh abandoned his body, as an insect abandons a blade of\r\ngrass. But Rutton Singh, having more work to do, went down from the\r\nhousetop and sought an enemy whom he had forgotten--a Patiala man of\r\nthis regiment who had sided with the persecutors. When he overtook the\r\nman, Rutton Singh hit him twice with bullets and once with the sword.'\r\n\r\n'But the man escaped and is now in the hospital here,' said the\r\nSubadar-Major. 'The doctor says he will live in spite of all.'\r\n\r\n'Not Rutton Singh's fault. Rutton Singh left him for dead. Then Rutton\r\nSingh returned to the housetop, and the three brothers together, Attar\r\nSingh being dead, sent word by a lad to the police station for an army\r\nto be dispatched against them that they might die with honours. But none\r\ncame. And yet Patiala State is not under English law and they should\r\nknow virtue there when they see it!\r\n\r\n'So, on the third day, Rutton Singh also made _shinan_, and the youngest\r\nof the brethren shot him also in the head, and _he_ abandoned his body.\r\n\r\n'Thus was all correct. There was neither heat, nor haste, nor abuse in\r\nthe matter from end to end. There remained alive not one man or woman of\r\ntheir mother's kin which had oppressed them. Of the other villagers of\r\nPishapur, who had taken no part in the persecutions, not one was slain.\r\nIndeed, the villagers sent them food on the housetop for those three\r\ndays while they waited for the police who would not dispatch that army.\r\n\r\n'Listen again! I know that Attar Singh and Rutton Singh omitted no\r\nceremony of the purifications, and when all was done Baynes Sahib's\r\nrevolver was thrown down from the housetop, together with three rupees\r\ntwelve annas; and order was given for its return by post.'\r\n\r\n'And what befell the two younger brethren who were not in the service?'\r\nthe Havildar-Major asked.\r\n\r\n'Doubtless they too are dead, but since they were not in the Regiment\r\ntheir honour concerns themselves only. So far as _we_ were touched, see\r\nhow correctly we came out of the matter! I think the King should be\r\ntold; for where could you match such a tale except among us Sikhs? _Sri\r\nwah guru ji ki Khalsa! Sri wah guru ji ki futteh!_' said the\r\nRegimental Chaplain.\r\n\r\n'Would three rupees twelve annas pay for the used cartridges?' said the\r\nHavildar-Major.\r\n\r\n'Attar Singh knew the just price. All Baynes Sahib's gear was in his\r\ncharge. They expended one tin box of fifty cartouches, lacking two which\r\nwere returned. As I said--as I say--the arrangement was made not with\r\nheat nor blasphemies as a Mussulman would have made it; not with cries\r\nnor caperings as an idolater would have made it; but conformably to the\r\nritual and doctrine of the Sikhs. Hear you! _\"Though hundreds of\r\namusements are offered to a child it cannot live without milk. If a man\r\nbe divorced from his soul and his soul's desire he certainly will not\r\nstop to play upon the road, but he will make haste with his\r\npilgrimage_.\" That is written. I rejoice in my disciples.'\r\n\r\n'True! True! Correct! Correct!' said the Subadar-Major. There was a\r\nlong, easy silence. One heard a water-wheel creaking somewhere and the\r\nnearer sound of meal being ground in a quern.\r\n\r\n'But he--' the Chaplain pointed a scornful chin at the\r\nHavildar-Major--'_he_ has been so long in England that--'\r\n\r\n'Let the lad alone,' said his uncle. 'He was but two months there, and\r\nhe was chosen for good cause.'\r\n\r\nTheoretically, all Sikhs are equal. Practically, there are differences,\r\nas none know better than well-born, land-owning folk, or long-descended\r\nchaplains from Amritsar.\r\n\r\n'Hast thou heard anything in England to match my tale?' the Chaplain\r\nsneered.\r\n\r\n'I saw more than I could understand, so I have locked up my stories in\r\nmy own mouth,' the Havildar-Major replied meekly.\r\n\r\n'Stories? What stories? I know all the stories about England,' said the\r\nChaplain. 'I know that _terains_ run underneath their bazaars there, and\r\nas for their streets stinking with _mota kahars_, only this morning I\r\nwas nearly killed by Duggan Sahib's _mota-kahar_. That young man is\r\na devil.'\r\n\r\n'I expect Grunthi-jee,' said the Subadar-Major, 'you and I grow too old\r\nto care for the Kahar-ki-nautch--the Bearer's dance.' He named one of\r\nthe sauciest of the old-time nautches, and smiled at his own pun. Then\r\nhe turned to his nephew. 'When I was a lad and came back to my village\r\non leave, I waited the convenient hour, and, the elders giving\r\npermission, I spoke of what I had seen elsewhere.'\r\n\r\n'Ay, my father,' said the Havildar-Major, softly and affectionately. He\r\nsat himself down with respect, as behoved a mere lad of thirty with a\r\nbare half-dozen campaigns to his credit.\r\n\r\n'There were four men in this affair also,' he began, 'and it was an\r\naffair that touched the honour, not of one regiment, nor two, but of all\r\nthe Army in Hind. Some part of it I saw; some I heard; but _all_ the\r\ntale is true. My father's brother knows, and my priest knows, that I was\r\nin England on business with my Colonel, when the King--the Great Queen's\r\nson--completed his life.\r\n\r\n'First, there was a rumour that sickness was upon him. Next, we knew\r\nthat he lay sick in the Palace. A very great multitude stood outside the\r\nPalace by night and by day, in the rain as well as the sun, waiting\r\nfor news.\r\n\r\n'Then came out one with a written paper, and set it upon a\r\ngate-side--the word of the King's death--and they read, and groaned.\r\nThis I saw with my own eyes, because the office where my Colonel Sahib\r\nwent daily to talk with Colonel Forsyth Sahib was at the east end of the\r\nvery gardens where the Palace stood. They are larger gardens than\r\nShalimar here'--he pointed with his chin up the lines--'or Shahdera\r\nacross the river.\r\n\r\n'Next day there was a darkness in the streets, because all the city's\r\nmultitude were clad in black garments, and they spoke as a man speaks in\r\nthe presence of his dead--all those multitudes. In the eyes, in the air,\r\nand in the heart, there was blackness. I saw it. But that is not\r\nmy tale.\r\n\r\n'After ceremonies had been accomplished, and word had gone out to the\r\nKings of the Earth that they should come and mourn, the new King--the\r\ndead King's son--gave commandment that his father's body should be laid,\r\ncoffined, in a certain Temple which is near the river. There are no\r\nidols in that Temple; neither any carvings, nor paintings, nor gildings.\r\nIt is all grey stone, of one colour as though it were cut out of the\r\nlive rock. It is larger than--yes, than the Durbar Sahib at Amritsar,\r\neven though the Akal Bunga and the Baba-Atal were added. How old it may\r\nbe God knows. It is the Sahibs' most sacred Temple.\r\n\r\n'In that place, by the new King's commandment, they made, as it were, a\r\nshrine for a saint, with lighted candles at the head and the feet of the\r\nDead, and duly appointed watchers for every hour of the day and the\r\nnight, until the dead King should be taken to the place of his fathers,\r\nwhich is at Wanidza.\r\n\r\n'When all was in order, the new King said, \"Give entrance to all\r\npeople,\" and the doors were opened, and O my uncle! O my teacher! all\r\nthe world entered, walking through that Temple to take farewell of the\r\nDead. There was neither distinction, nor price, nor ranking in the host,\r\nexcept an order that they should walk by fours.\r\n\r\n'As they gathered in the streets without--very, very far off--so they\r\nentered the Temple, walking by fours: the child, the old man; mother,\r\nvirgin, harlot, trader, priest; of all colours and faiths and customs\r\nunder the firmament of God, from dawn till late at night. I saw it. My\r\nColonel gave me leave to go. I stood in the line, many hours, one\r\n_koss_, two _koss_, distant from the temple.'\r\n\r\n'Then why did the multitude not sit down under the trees?' asked the\r\npriest.\r\n\r\n'Because we were still between houses. The city is many _koss_ wide,'\r\nthe Havildar-Major resumed. 'I submitted myself to that slow-moving\r\nriver and thus--thus--a pace at a time--I made pilgrimage. There were in\r\nmy rank a woman, a cripple, and a lascar from the ships.\r\n\r\n'When we entered the Temple, the coffin itself was as a shoal in the\r\nRavi River, splitting the stream into two branches, one on either side\r\nof the Dead; and the watchers of the Dead, who were soldiers, stood\r\nabout It, moving no more than the still flame of the candles. Their\r\nheads were bowed; their hands were clasped; their eyes were cast upon\r\nthe ground--thus. They were not men, but images, and the multitude went\r\npast them in fours by day, and, except for a little while, by\r\nnight also.\r\n\r\n'No, there was no order that the people should come to pay respect. It\r\nwas a free-will pilgrimage. Eight kings had been commanded to come--who\r\nobeyed--but upon his own Sahibs the new King laid no commandment. Of\r\nthemselves they came.\r\n\r\n'I made pilgrimage twice: once for my Salt's sake, and once again for\r\nwonder and terror and worship. But my mouth cannot declare one thing of\r\na hundred thousand things in this matter. There were _lakhs_ of _lakhs_,\r\n_crores_ of _crores_ of people. I saw them.'\r\n\r\n'More than at our great pilgrimages?' the Regimental Chaplain demanded.\r\n\r\n'Yes. Those are only cities and districts coming out to pray. This was\r\nthe world walking in grief. And now, hear you! It is the King's custom\r\nthat four swords of Our Armies in Hind should stand always before the\r\nPresence in case of need.'\r\n\r\n'The King's custom, our right,' said the Subadar-Major curtly.\r\n\r\n'Also our right. These honoured ones are changed after certain months or\r\nyears, that the honour may be fairly spread. Now it chanced that when\r\nthe old King--the Queen's son--completed his days, the four that stood\r\nin the Presence were Goorkhas. Neither Sikhs alas, nor Pathans, Rajputs,\r\nnor Jats. Goorkhas, my father.'\r\n\r\n'Idolaters,' said the Chaplain.\r\n\r\n'But soldiers; for I remember in the Tirah--' the Havildar-Major began.\r\n\r\n'_But_ soldiers, for I remember fifteen campaigns. Go on,' said the\r\nSubadar-Major.\r\n\r\n'And it was their honour and right to furnish one who should stand in\r\nthe Presence by day and by night till It went out to burial. There were\r\nno more than four all told--four old men to furnish that guard.'\r\n\r\n'Old? Old? What talk is this of old men?' said the Subadar-Major.\r\n\r\n'Nay. My fault! Your pardon!' The Havildar-Major spread a deprecating\r\nhand. 'They were strong, hot, valiant men, and the youngest was a lad of\r\nforty-five.'\r\n\r\n'That is better,' the Subadar-Major laughed.\r\n\r\n'But for all their strength and heat they could not eat strange food\r\nfrom the Sahibs' hands. There was no cooking place in the Temple; but a\r\ncertain Colonel Forsyth Sahib, who had understanding, made arrangement\r\nwhereby they should receive at least a little caste-clean parched grain;\r\nalso cold rice maybe, and water which was pure. Yet, at best, this was\r\nno more than a hen's mouthful, snatched as each came off his guard. They\r\nlived on grain and were thankful, as the saying is.\r\n\r\n'One hour's guard in every four was each man's burden, for, as I have\r\nshown, they were but four all told; and the honour of Our Armies in Hind\r\nwas on their heads. The Sahibs could draw upon all the armies in England\r\nfor the other watchers--thousands upon thousands of fresh men--if they\r\nneeded; but these four were but four.\r\n\r\n'The Sahibs drew upon the Granadeers for the other watchers. Granadeers\r\nbe very tall men under very tall bearskins, such as Fusilier regiments\r\nwear in cold weather. Thus, when a Granadeer bowed his head but a very\r\nlittle over his stock, the bearskin sloped and showed as though he\r\ngrieved exceedingly. Now the Goorkhas wear flat, green caps--'\r\n\r\n'I see, I see,' said the Subadar-Major impatiently.\r\n\r\n'They are bull-necked, too; and their stocks are hard, and when they\r\nbend deeply--deeply--to match the Granadeers--they come nigh to choking\r\nthemselves. That was a handicap against them, when it came to the\r\nobservance of ritual.\r\n\r\n'Yet even with their tall, grief-declaring bearskins, the Granadeers\r\ncould not endure the full hour's guard in the Presence. There was good\r\ncause, as I will show, why no man could endure that terrible hour. So\r\nfor them the hour's guard was cut to one-half. What did it matter to the\r\nSahibs? They could draw on ten thousand Granadeers. Forsyth Sahib, who\r\nhad comprehension, put this choice also before the four, and they said,\r\n\"No, ours is the Honour of the Armies of Hind. Whatever the Sahibs do,\r\nwe will suffer the full hour.\"\r\n\r\n'Forsyth Sahib, seeing that they were--knowing that they could neither\r\nsleep long nor eat much, said, \"Is it great suffering?\" They said, \"It\r\nis great honour. We will endure.\"\r\n\r\n'Forsyth Sahib, who loves us, said then to the eldest, \"Ho, father, tell\r\nme truly what manner of burden it is; for the full hour's watch breaks\r\nup our men like water.\"\r\n\r\n'The eldest answered, \"Sahib, the burden is the feet of the multitude\r\nthat pass us on either side. Our eyes being lowered and fixed, we see\r\nthose feet only from the knee down--a river of feet, Sahib, that\r\nnever--never--never stops. It is not the standing without any motion; it\r\nis not hunger; nor is it the dead part before the dawn when maybe a\r\nsingle one comes here to weep. It is the burden of the unendurable\r\nprocession of feet from the knee down, that never--never--never stops!\"\r\n\r\n'Forsyth Sahib said, \"By God, I had not considered that! Now I know why\r\nour men come trembling and twitching off that guard. But at least, my\r\nfather, ease the stock a little beneath the bent chin for that\r\none hour.\"\r\n\r\n'The eldest said, \"We are in the Presence. Moreover _He_ knew every\r\nbutton and braid and hook of every uniform in all His armies.\"\r\n\r\n'Then Forsyth Sahib said no more, except to speak about their parched\r\ngrain, but indeed they could not eat much after their hour, nor could\r\nthey sleep much because of eye-twitchings and the renewed procession of\r\nthe feet before the eyes. Yet they endured each his full hour--not half\r\nan hour--his one full hour in each four hours.'\r\n\r\n'Correct! correct!' said the Subadar-Major and the Chaplain together.\r\n'We come well out of this affair.'\r\n\r\n'But seeing that they were old men,' said the Subadar-Major\r\nreflectively, 'very old men, worn out by lack of food and sleep, could\r\nnot arrangements have been made, or influence have been secured, or a\r\npetition presented, whereby a well-born Sikh might have eased them of\r\nsome portion of their great burden, even though his substantive rank--'\r\n\r\n'Then they would most certainly have slain me,' said the Havildar-Major\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\n'And they would have done correctly,' said the Chaplain. 'What befell\r\nthe honourable ones later?'\r\n\r\n'This. The Kings of the earth and all the Armies sent flowers and\r\nsuch-like to the dead King's palace at Wanidza, where the funeral\r\nofferings were accepted. There was no order given, but all the world\r\nmade oblation. So the four took counsel--three at a time--and either\r\nthey asked Forsyth Sahib to choose flowers, or themselves they went\r\nforth and bought flowers--I do not know; but, however it was arranged,\r\nthe flowers were bought and made in the shape of a great drum-like\r\ncircle weighing half a _maund_.\r\n\r\n'Forsyth Sahib had said, \"Let the flowers be sent to Wanidza with the\r\nother flowers which all the world is sending.\" But they said among\r\nthemselves, \"It is not fit that these flowers, which are the offerings\r\nof His Armies in Hind, should come to the Palace of the Presence by the\r\nhands of hirelings or messengers, or of any man not in His service.\"\r\n\r\n'Hearing this, Forsyth Sahib, though he was much occupied with\r\noffice-work, said, \"Give me the flowers, and I will steal a time and\r\nmyself take them to Wanidza.\"\r\n\r\n'The eldest said, \"Since when has Forsyth Sahib worn sword?\"\r\n\r\n'Forsyth Sahib said, \"But always. And I wear it in the Presence when I\r\nput on uniform. I am a Colonel in the Armies of Hind.\" The eldest said,\r\n\"Of what regiment?\" And Forsyth Sahib looked on the carpet and pulled\r\nthe hair of his lip. He saw the trap.'\r\n\r\n'Forsyth Sahib's regiment was once the old Forty-sixth Pathans which\r\nwas called--' the Subadar-Major gave the almost forgotten title, adding\r\nthat he had met them in such and such campaigns, when Forsyth Sahib was\r\na young captain.\r\n\r\nThe Havildar-Major took up the tale, saying, 'The eldest knew that also,\r\nmy father. He laughed, and presently Forsyth Sahib laughed.\r\n\r\n'\"It is true,\" said Forsyth Sahib. \"I have no regiment. For twenty years\r\nI have been a clerk tied to a thick pen. Therefore I am the more fit to\r\nbe your orderly and messenger in this business.\"\r\n\r\n'The eldest then said, \"If it were a matter of my life or the honour of\r\n_any_ of my household, it would be easy.\" And Forsyth Sahib joined his\r\nhands together, half laughing, though he was ready to weep, and he said,\r\n\"Enough! I ask pardon. Which one of you goes with the offering?\"\r\n\r\n'The eldest said, feigning not to have heard, \"Nor must they be\r\ndelivered by a single sword--as though we were pressed for men in His\r\nservice,\" and they saluted and went out.'\r\n\r\n'Were these things seen, or were they told thee?' said the\r\nSubadar-Major.\r\n\r\n'I both saw and heard in the office full of books and papers where my\r\nColonel Sahib consulted Forsyth Sahib upon the business that had brought\r\nmy Colonel Sahib to England.'\r\n\r\n'And what was that business?' the Regimental Chaplain asked of a sudden,\r\nlooking full at the Havildar-Major, who returned the look without\r\na quiver.\r\n\r\n'That was not revealed to me,' said the Havildar-Major.\r\n\r\n'I heard it might have been some matter touching the integrity of\r\ncertain regiments,' the Chaplain insisted.\r\n\r\n'The matter was not in any way open to my ears,' said the\r\nHavildar-Major.\r\n\r\n'Humph!' The Chaplain drew his hard road-worn feet under his robe. 'Let\r\nus hear the tale that it is permitted thee to tell,' he said, and the\r\nHavildar-Major went on:\r\n\r\n'So then the three, having returned to the Temple, called the fourth,\r\nwho had only forty-five years, when he came off guard, and said, \"We go\r\nto the Palace at Wanidza with the offerings. Remain thou in the\r\nPresence, and take all our guards, one after the other, till we return.\"\r\n\r\n'Within that next hour they hired a large and strong _mota-kahar_ for\r\nthe journey from the Temple to Wanidza, which is twenty _koss_ or more,\r\nand they promised expedition. But he who took their guards said, \"It is\r\nnot seemly that we should for any cause appear to be in haste. There are\r\neighteen medals with eleven clasps and three Orders to consider. Go at\r\nleisure. I can endure.\"\r\n\r\n'So the three with the offerings were absent three hours and a half, and\r\nhaving delivered the offering at Wanidza in the correct manner they\r\nreturned and found the lad on guard, and they did not break his guard\r\ntill his full hour was ended. So _he_ endured four hours in the\r\nPresence, not stirring one hair, his eyes abased, and the river of\r\nfeet, from the knee down, passing continually before his eyes. When he\r\nwas relieved, it was seen that his eyeballs worked like\r\nweavers' shuttles.\r\n\r\n'And so it was done--not in hot blood, not for a little while, nor yet\r\nwith the smell of slaughter and the noise of shouting to sustain, but in\r\nsilence, for a very long time, rooted to one place before the Presence\r\namong the most terrible feet of the multitude.'\r\n\r\n'Correct!' the Chaplain chuckled.\r\n\r\n'But the Goorkhas had the honour,' said the Subadar-Major sadly.\r\n\r\n'Theirs was the Honour of His Armies in Hind, and that was Our Honour,'\r\nthe nephew replied.\r\n\r\n'Yet I would one Sikh had been concerned in it--even one low-caste Sikh.\r\nAnd after?'\r\n\r\n'They endured the burden until the end--until It went out of the Temple\r\nto be laid among the older kings at Wanidza. When all was accomplished\r\nand It was withdrawn under the earth, Forsyth Sahib said to the four,\r\n\"The King gives command that you be fed here on meat cooked by your own\r\ncooks. Eat and take ease, my fathers.\"\r\n\r\n'So they loosed their belts and ate. They had not eaten food except by\r\nsnatches for some long time; and when the meat had given them strength\r\nthey slept for very many hours; and it was told me that the procession\r\nof the unendurable feet ceased to pass before their eyes any more.'\r\n\r\nHe threw out one hand palm upward to show that the tale was ended.\r\n\r\n'We came well and cleanly out of it,' said the Subadar-Major.\r\n\r\n'Correct! Correct! Correct!' said the Regimental Chaplain. 'In an evil\r\nage it is good to hear such things, and there is certainly no doubt that\r\nthis is a very evil age.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOBSON'S AMEN\r\n\r\n     'Blessed be the English and all their ways and works.\r\n     Cursed be the Infidels, Hereticks, and Turks!'\r\n     'Amen,' quo' Jobson, 'but where I used to lie\r\n     Was neither Candle, Bell nor Book to curse my brethren by:\r\n\r\n     'But a palm-tree in full bearing, bowing down, bowing down,\r\n     To a surf that drove unsparing at the brown-walled town--\r\n     Conches in a temple, oil-lamps in a dome--\r\n     And a low moon out of Africa said: \"This way home!\"'\r\n\r\n     'Blessed be the English and all that they profess.\r\n     Cursed be the Savages that prance in nakedness!'\r\n     'Amen,' quo' Jobson, 'but where I used to lie\r\n     Was neither shirt nor pantaloons to catch my brethren by:\r\n\r\n     'But a well-wheel slowly creaking, going round, going round,\r\n     By a water-channel leaking over drowned, warm ground--\r\n     Parrots very busy in the trellised pepper-vine--\r\n     And a high sun over Asia shouting: \"Rise and shine!\"'\r\n\r\n     'Blessed be the English and everything they own.\r\n     Cursed be the Infidels that bow to wood and stone!'\r\n     'Amen,' quo' Jobson, 'but where I used to lie\r\n     Was neither pew nor Gospelleer to save my brethren by:\r\n\r\n     'But a desert stretched and stricken, left and right, left\r\n           and right,\r\n     Where the piled mirages thicken under white-hot light--\r\n     A skull beneath a sand-hill and a viper coiled inside--\r\n     And a red wind out of Libya roaring: \"Run and hide!\"'\r\n\r\n     'Blessed be the English and all they make or do.\r\n     Cursed be the Hereticks who doubt that this is true!'\r\n     'Amen,' quo' Jobson, 'but where I mean to die\r\n     Is neither rule nor calliper to judge the matter by:\r\n\r\n     'But Himalaya heavenward-heading, sheer and vast, sheer and vast,\r\n     In a million summits bedding on the last world's past;\r\n     A certain sacred mountain where the scented cedars climb,\r\n     And--the feet of my Beloved hurrying back through Time!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULUS\r\n\r\n(1917)\r\n\r\n_Regulus, a Roman general, defeated the Carthaginians 256 B.C., but was\r\nnext year defeated and taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, who sent him\r\nto Rome with an embassy to ask for peace or an exchange of prisoners.\r\nRegulus strongly advised the Roman Senate to make no terms with the\r\nenemy. He then returned to Carthage and was put to death._\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Form had been dragged several times in its collective life,\r\nfrom one end of the school Horace to the other. Those were the years\r\nwhen Army examiners gave thousands of marks for Latin, and it was Mr.\r\nKing's hated business to defeat them.\r\n\r\nHear him, then, on a raw November morning at second lesson.\r\n\r\n'Aha!' he began, rubbing his hands. '_Cras ingens iterabimus aequor._\r\nOur portion to-day is the Fifth Ode of the Third Book, I\r\nbelieve--concerning one Regulus, a gentleman. And how often have we been\r\nthrough it?'\r\n\r\n'Twice, sir,' said Malpass, head of the Form.\r\n\r\nMr. King shuddered. 'Yes, twice, quite literally,' he said. 'To-day,\r\nwith an eye to your Army _viva-voce_ examinations--ugh!--I shall exact\r\nsomewhat freer and more florid renditions. With feeling and\r\ncomprehension if that be possible. I except'--here his eye swept the\r\nback benches--'our friend and companion Beetle, from whom, now as\r\nalways, I demand an absolutely literal translation.' The form laughed\r\nsubserviently.\r\n\r\n'Spare his blushes! Beetle charms us first.'\r\n\r\nBeetle stood up, confident in the possession of a guaranteed construe,\r\nleft behind by M'Turk, who had that day gone into the sick-house with a\r\ncold. Yet he was too wary a hand to show confidence.\r\n\r\n'_Credidimus_, we--believe--we have believed,' he opened in\r\nhesitating slow time, '_tonantem Joven_, thundering Jove--_regnare_,\r\nto reign--_caelo_, in heaven. _Augustus_, Augustus--_habebitur_,\r\nwill be held or considered--_praesens divus_, a present\r\nGod--_adjectis Britannis_, the Britons being added--_imperio_, to the\r\nEmpire--_gravibusque Persis_, with the heavy--er, stern Persians.'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'The grave or stern Persians.' Beetle pulled up with the\r\n'Thank-God-I-have-done-my-duty' air of Nelson in the cockpit.\r\n\r\n'I am quite aware,' said King, 'that the first stanza is about the\r\nextent of your knowledge, but continue, sweet one, continue. _Gravibus_,\r\nby the way, is usually translated as \"troublesome.\"'\r\n\r\nBeetle drew a long and tortured breath. The second stanza (which carries\r\nover to the third) of that Ode is what is technically called a\r\n'stinker.' But M'Turk had done him handsomely.\r\n\r\n'_Milesne Crassi_, had--has the soldier of Crassus--_vixit_,\r\nlived--_turpis maritus_, a disgraceful husband--'\r\n\r\n'You slurred the quantity of the word after _turpis_,' said King. 'Let's\r\nhear it.'\r\n\r\nBeetle guessed again, and for a wonder hit the correct quantity. 'Er--a\r\ndisgraceful husband--_conjuge barbara_, with a barbarous spouse.'\r\n\r\n'Why do you select _that_ disgustful equivalent out of all the\r\ndictionary?' King snapped. 'Isn't \"wife\" good enough for you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. But what do I do about this bracket, sir? Shall I take it\r\nnow?'\r\n\r\n'Confine yourself at present to the soldier of Crassus.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. _Et_, and--_consenuit_, has he grown old--_in armis_, in\r\nthe--er--arms--_hositum socerorum_, of his father-in-law's enemies.'\r\n\r\n'Who? How? Which?'\r\n\r\n'Arms of his enemies' fathers-in-law, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Tha-anks. By the way, what meaning might you attach to _in armis_?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, weapons--weapons of war, sir.' There was a virginal note in\r\nBeetle's voice as though he had been falsely accused of uttering\r\nindecencies. 'Shall I take the bracket now, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Since it seems to be troubling you.'\r\n\r\n'_Pro Curia_, O for the Senate House--_inversique mores_, and manners\r\nupset--upside down.'\r\n\r\n'Ve-ry like your translation. Meantime, the soldier of Crassus?'\r\n\r\n'_Sub rege Medo_, under a Median King--_Marsus et Apulus_, he being a\r\nMarsian and an Apulian.'\r\n\r\n'Who? The Median King?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir. The soldier of Crassus. _Oblittus_ agrees with _milesne\r\nCrassi_, sir,' volunteered too-hasty Beetle.\r\n\r\n'Does it? It doesn't with _me_.'\r\n\r\n'_Oh-blight-us_,' Beetle corrected hastily, 'forgetful--_anciliorum_, of\r\nthe shields, or trophies--_et nominis_, and the--his name--_et togae_,\r\nand the toga--_eternaeque Vestae_, and eternal Vesta--_incolumi Jove_,\r\nJove being safe--_et urbe Roma_, and the Roman city.' With an air of\r\nhardly restrained zeal--'Shall I go on, sir?'\r\n\r\nMr. King winced. 'No, thank you. You have indeed given us a translation!\r\nMay I ask if it conveys any meaning whatever to your so-called mind?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I think so, sir.' This with gentle toleration for Horace and all\r\nhis works.\r\n\r\n'We envy you. Sit down.'\r\n\r\nBeetle sat down relieved, well knowing that a reef of uncharted\r\ngenitives stretched ahead of him, on which in spite of M'Turk's\r\nsailing-directions he would infallibly have been wrecked.\r\n\r\nRattray, who took up the task, steered neatly through them and came\r\nunscathed to port.\r\n\r\n'Here we require drama,' said King. 'Regulus himself is speaking now.\r\nWho shall represent the provident-minded Regulus? Winton, will you\r\nkindly oblige?'\r\n\r\nWinton of King's House, a long, heavy, tow-headed Second Fifteen\r\nforward, overdue for his First Fifteen colours, and in aspect like an\r\nearnest, elderly horse, rose up, and announced, among other things,\r\nthat he had seen 'signs affixed to Punic deluges.' Half the Form shouted\r\nfor joy, and the other half for joy that there was something to\r\nshout about.\r\n\r\nMr. King opened and shut his eyes with great swiftness. '_Signa adfixa\r\ndelubris_,' he gasped. 'So _delubris_ is \"deluges\" is it? Winton, in all\r\nour dealings, have I ever suspected you of a jest?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir,' said the rigid and angular Winton, while the Form rocked\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n'And yet you assert _delubris_ means \"deluges.\" Whether I am a fit\r\nsubject for such a jape is, of course, a matter of opinion, but....\r\nWinton, you are normally conscientious. May we assume you looked out\r\n_delubris_?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.' Winton was privileged to speak that truth dangerous to all\r\nwho stand before Kings.\r\n\r\n''Made a shot at it then?'\r\n\r\nEvery line of Winton's body showed he had done nothing of the sort.\r\nIndeed, the very idea that 'Pater' Winton (and a boy is not called\r\n'Pater' by companions for his frivolity) would make a shot at anything\r\nwas beyond belief. But he replied, 'Yes,' and all the while worked with\r\nhis right heel as though he were heeling a ball at punt-about.\r\n\r\nThough none dared to boast of being a favourite with King, the taciturn,\r\nthree-cornered Winton stood high in his House-Master's opinion. It\r\nseemed to save him neither rebuke nor punishment, but the two were in\r\nsome fashion sympathetic.\r\n\r\n'Hm!' said King drily. 'I was going to say--_Flagito additis damnum_,\r\nbut I think--I think I see the process. Beetle, the translation of\r\n_delubris_, please.'\r\n\r\nBeetle raised his head from his shaking arm long enough to answer:\r\n'Ruins, sir.'\r\n\r\nThere was an impressive pause while King checked off crimes on his\r\nfingers. Then to Beetle the much-enduring man addressed winged words:\r\n\r\n'Guessing,' said he. 'Guessing, Beetle, as usual, from the look of\r\n_delubris_ that it bore some relation to _diluvium_ or deluge, you\r\nimparted the result of your half-baked lucubrations to Winton who seems\r\nto have been lost enough to have accepted it. Observing next, your\r\ncompanion's fall, from the presumed security of your undistinguished\r\nposition in the rear-guard, you took another pot-shot. The turbid chaos\r\nof your mind threw up some memory of the word \"dilapidations\" which you\r\nhave pitifully attempted to disguise under the synonym of \"ruins.\"'\r\n\r\nAs this was precisely what Beetle had done he looked hurt but forgiving.\r\n'We will attend to this later,' said King. 'Go on, Winton, and retrieve\r\nyourself.'\r\n\r\n_Delubris_ happened to be the one word which Winton had not looked out\r\nand had asked Beetle for, when they were settling into their places. He\r\nforged ahead with no further trouble. Only when he rendered _scilicet_\r\nas 'forsooth,' King erupted.\r\n\r\n'Regulus,' he said, 'was not a leader-writer for the penny press, nor,\r\nfor that matter, was Horace. Regulus says: \"The soldier ransomed by gold\r\nwill come keener for the fight--will he by--by gum!\" _That's_ the\r\nmeaning of _scilicet_. It indicates contempt--bitter contempt.\r\n\"Forsooth,\" forsooth! You'll be talking about \"speckled beauties\" and\r\n\"eventually transpire\" next. Howell, what do you make of that doubled\r\n\"Vidi ego--ego vidi\"? It wasn't put in to fill up the metre, you know.'\r\n\r\n'Isn't it intensive, sir?' said Howell, afflicted by a genuine interest\r\nin what he read. 'Regulus was a bit in earnest about Rome making no\r\nterms with Carthage--and he wanted to let the Romans understand it,\r\ndidn't he, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Less than your usual grace, but the fact. Regulus _was_ in earnest. He\r\nwas also engaged at the same time in cutting his own throat with every\r\nword he uttered. He knew Carthage which (your examiners won't ask you\r\nthis so you needn't take notes) was a sort of God-forsaken nigger\r\nManchester. Regulus was not thinking about his own life. He was telling\r\nRome the truth. He was playing for his side. Those lines from the\r\neighteenth to the fortieth ought to be written in blood. Yet there are\r\nthings in human garments which will tell you that Horace was a\r\nflâneur--a man about town. Avoid such beings. Horace knew a very great\r\ndeal. _He_ knew! _Erit ille fortis_--\"will he be brave who once to\r\nfaithless foes has knelt?\" And again (stop pawing with your hooves,\r\nThornton!) _hic unde vitam sumeret inscius_. That means roughly--but I\r\nperceive I am ahead of my translators. Begin at _hic unde_, Vernon, and\r\nlet us see if you have the spirit of Regulus.'\r\n\r\nNow no one expected fireworks from gentle Paddy Vernon, sub-prefect of\r\nHartopp's House, but, as must often be the case with growing boys, his\r\nmind was in abeyance for the time being, and he said, all in a rush, on\r\nbehalf of Regulus: '_O magna Carthago probrosis altior Italiae ruinis_,\r\nO Carthage, thou wilt stand forth higher than the ruins of Italy.'\r\n\r\nEven Beetle, most lenient of critics, was interested at this point,\r\nthough he did not join the half-groan of reprobation from the wiser\r\nheads of the Form.\r\n\r\n'_Please_ don't mind me,' said King, and Vernon very kindly did not. He\r\nploughed on thus: 'He (Regulus) is related to have removed from himself\r\nthe kiss of the shameful wife and of his small children as less by the\r\nhead, and, being stern, to have placed his virile visage on the ground.'\r\n\r\nSince King loved 'virile' about as much as he did 'spouse' or 'forsooth'\r\nthe Form looked up hopefully. But Jove thundered not.\r\n\r\n'Until,' Vernon continued, 'he should have confirmed the sliding fathers\r\nas being the author of counsel never given under an alias.'\r\n\r\nHe stopped, conscious of stillness round him like the dread calm of the\r\ntyphoon's centre. King's opening voice was sweeter than honey.\r\n\r\n'I am painfully aware by bitter experience that I cannot give you any\r\nidea of the passion, the power, the--the essential guts of the lines\r\nwhich you have so foully outraged in our presence. But--' the note\r\nchanged, 'so far as in me lies, I will strive to bring home to you,\r\nVernon, the fact that there exist in Latin a few pitiful rules of\r\ngrammar, of syntax, nay, even of declension, which were not created for\r\nyour incult sport--your Boeotian diversion. You will, therefore, Vernon,\r\nwrite out and bring to me to-morrow a word-for-word English-Latin\r\ntranslation of the Ode, together with a full list of all adjectives--an\r\nadjective is not a verb, Vernon, as the Lower Third will tell you--all\r\nadjectives, their number, case, and gender. Even now I haven't begun to\r\ndeal with you faithfully.'\r\n\r\n'I--I'm very sorry, sir,' Vernon stammered.\r\n\r\n'You mistake the symptoms, Vernon. You are possibly discomfited by the\r\nimposition, but sorrow postulates some sort of mind, intellect, _nous_.\r\nYour rendering of _probrosis_ alone stamps you as lower than the beasts\r\nof the field. Will some one take the taste out of our mouths?\r\nAnd--talking of tastes--' He coughed. There was a distinct flavour of\r\nchlorine gas in the air. Up went an eyebrow, though King knew perfectly\r\nwell what it meant.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Hartopp's st--science class next door,' said Malpass.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes. I had forgotten. Our newly established Modern Side, of course.\r\nPerowne, open the windows; and Winton, go on once more from _interque\r\nmaerentes_.'\r\n\r\n'And hastened away,' said Winton, 'surrounded by his mourning friends,\r\ninto--into illustrious banishment. But I got that out of Conington,\r\nsir,' he added in one conscientious breath.\r\n\r\n'I am aware. The master generally knows his ass's crib, though I acquit\r\n_you_ of any intention that way. Can you suggest anything for _egregius\r\nexul_? Only \"egregious exile\"? I fear \"egregious\" is a good word ruined.\r\nNo! You can't in this case improve on Conington. Now then for _atqui\r\nsciebat quae sibi barbarus tortor pararet_. The whole force of it lies\r\nin the _atqui_.'\r\n\r\n'Although he knew,' Winton suggested.\r\n\r\n'Stronger than that, I think.'\r\n\r\n'He who knew well,' Malpass interpolated.\r\n\r\n'Ye-es. \"Well though he knew.\" I don't like Conington's \"well-witting.\"\r\nIt's Wardour Street.'\r\n\r\n'Well though he knew what the savage torturer was--was getting ready for\r\nhim,' said Winton.\r\n\r\n'Ye-es. Had in store for him.'\r\n\r\n'Yet he brushed aside his kinsmen and the people delaying his return.'\r\n\r\n'Ye-es; but then how do you render _obstantes_?'\r\n\r\n'If it's a free translation mightn't _obstantes_ and _morantem_ come to\r\nabout the same thing, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing comes to \"about the same thing\" with Horace, Winton. As I have\r\nsaid, Horace was not a journalist. No, I take it that his kinsmen bodily\r\nwithstood his departure, whereas the crowd--_populumque_--the democracy\r\nstood about futilely pitying him and getting in the way. Now for that\r\nnoblest of endings--_quam si clientum_,' and King ran off into the\r\nquotation:\r\n\r\n     'As though some tedious business o'er\r\n     Of clients' court, his journey lay\r\n     Towards Venafrum's grassy floor\r\n     Or Sparta-built Tarentum's bay.\r\n\r\nAll right, Winton. Beetle, when you've quite finished dodging the fresh\r\nair yonder, give me the meaning of _tendens_--and turn down\r\nyour collar.'\r\n\r\n'Me, sir? _Tendens_, sir? Oh! Stretching away in the direction of, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Idiot! Regulus was not a feature of the landscape. He was a man,\r\nself-doomed to death by torture. _Atqui, sciebat_--knowing it--having\r\nachieved it for his country's sake--can't you hear that _atqui_ cut like\r\na knife?--he moved off with some dignity. That is why Horace out of the\r\nwhole golden Latin tongue chose the one word \"tendens\"--which is utterly\r\nuntranslatable.'\r\n\r\nThe gross injustice of being asked to translate it, converted Beetle\r\ninto a young Christian martyr, till King buried his nose in his\r\nhandkerchief again.\r\n\r\n'I think they've broken another gas-bottle next door, sir,' said Howell.\r\n'They're always doing it.' The Form coughed as more chlorine came in.\r\n\r\n'Well, I suppose we must be patient with the Modern Side,' said King.\r\n'But it is almost insupportable for this Side. Vernon, what are you\r\ngrinning at?'\r\n\r\nVernon's mind had returned to him glowing and inspired. He chuckled as\r\nhe underlined his Horace.\r\n\r\n'It appears to amuse you,' said King. 'Let us participate. What is it?'\r\n\r\n'The last two lines of the Tenth Ode, in this book, sir,' was Vernon's\r\namazing reply.\r\n\r\n'What? Oh, I see. _Non hoc semper erit liminis aut aquae caelestis\r\npatiens latus_[2].' King's mouth twitched to hide a grin. 'Was that\r\ndone with intention?'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 'This side will not always be patient of rain and waiting\r\non the threshold.']\r\n\r\n'I--I thought it fitted, sir.'\r\n\r\n'It does. It's distinctly happy. What put it into your thick head,\r\nPaddy?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know, sir, except we did the Ode last term.'\r\n\r\n'And you remembered? The same head that minted _probrosis_ as a verb!\r\nVernon, you are an enigma. No! This Side will _not_ always be patient of\r\nunheavenly gases and waters. I will make representations to our\r\nso-called Moderns. Meantime (who shall say I am not just?) I remit you\r\nyour accrued pains and penalties in regard to _probrosim, probrosis,\r\nprobrosit_ and other enormities. I oughtn't to do it, but this Side is\r\noccasionally human. By no means bad, Paddy.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir,' said Vernon, wondering how inspiration had visited\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThen King, with a few brisk remarks about Science, headed them back to\r\nRegulus, of whom and of Horace and Rome and evil-minded commercial\r\nCarthage and of the democracy eternally futile, he explained, in all\r\nages and climes, he spoke for ten minutes; passing thence to the next\r\nOde--_Delicta Majorum_--where he fetched up, full-voiced, upon--'_Dis te\r\nminorem quod geris imperas_' (Thou rulest because thou bearest thyself\r\nas lower than the Gods)--making it a text for a discourse on manners,\r\nmorals, and respect for authority as distinct from bottled gases, which\r\nlasted till the bell rang. Then Beetle, concertinaing his books,\r\nobserved to Winton, 'When King's really on tap he's an interestin' dog.\r\nHartopp's chlorine uncorked him.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; but why did you tell me _delubris_ was \"deluges,\" you silly ass?'\r\nsaid Winton.\r\n\r\n'Well, that uncorked him too. Look out, you hoof-handed old owl!' Winton\r\nhad cleared for action as the Form poured out like puppies at play and\r\nwas scragging Beetle. Stalky from behind collared Winton low. The three\r\nfell in confusion.\r\n\r\n'_Dis te minorem quod geris imperas_,' quoth Stalky, ruffling Winton's\r\nlint-white locks. 'Mustn't jape with Number Five study. Don't be too\r\nvirtuous. Don't brood over it. 'Twon't count against you in your future\r\ncaree-ah. Cheer up, Pater.'\r\n\r\n'Pull him off my--er--essential guts, will you?' said Beetle from\r\nbeneath. 'He's squashin' 'em.'\r\n\r\nThey dispersed to their studies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo one, the owner least of all, can explain what is in a growing boy's\r\nmind. It might have been the blind ferment of adolescence; Stalky's\r\nrandom remarks about virtue might have stirred him; like his betters he\r\nmight have sought popularity by way of clowning; or, as the Head\r\nasserted years later, the only known jest of his serious life might have\r\nworked on him, as a sober-sided man's one love colours and dislocates\r\nall his after days. But, at the next lesson, mechanical drawing with Mr.\r\nLidgett who as drawing-master had very limited powers of punishment,\r\nWinton fell suddenly from grace and let loose a live mouse in the\r\nform-room. The whole form, shrieking and leaping high, threw at it all\r\nthe plaster cones, pyramids, and fruit in high relief--not to mention\r\nink-pots--that they could lay hands on. Mr. Lidgett reported at once to\r\nthe Head; Winton owned up to his crime, which, venial in the Upper\r\nThird, pardonable at a price in the Lower Fourth, was, of course, rank\r\nruffianism on the part of a Fifth Form boy; and so, by graduated stages,\r\nhe arrived at the Head's study just before lunch, penitent, perturbed,\r\nannoyed with himself and--as the Head said to King in the corridor after\r\nthe meal--more human than he had known him in seven years.\r\n\r\n'You see,' the Head drawled on, 'Winton's only fault is a certain\r\ncostive and unaccommodating virtue. So this comes very happily.'\r\n\r\n'I've never noticed any sign of it,' said King. Winton was in King's\r\nHouse, and though King as pro-consul might, and did, infernally oppress\r\nhis own Province, once a black and yellow cap was in trouble at the\r\nhands of the Imperial authority King fought for him to the very last\r\nsteps of Caesar's throne.\r\n\r\n'Well, you yourself admitted just now that a mouse was beneath the\r\noccasion,' the Head answered.\r\n\r\n'It was.' Mr. King did not love Mr. Lidgett. 'It should have been a rat.\r\nBut--but--I hate to plead it--it's the lad's first offence.'\r\n\r\n'Could you have damned him more completely, King?'\r\n\r\n'Hm. What is the penalty?' said King, in retreat, but keeping up a\r\nrear-guard action.\r\n\r\n'Only my usual few lines of Virgil to be shown up by tea-time.'\r\n\r\nThe Head's eyes turned slightly to that end of the corridor where\r\nMullins, Captain of the Games ('Pot,' 'old Pot,' or 'Potiphar' Mullins),\r\nwas pinning up the usual Wednesday notice--'Big, Middle, and Little Side\r\nFootball--A to K, L to Z, 3 to 4.45 P.M.'\r\n\r\nYou cannot write out the Head's usual few (which means five hundred)\r\nLatin lines and play football for one hour and three-quarters between\r\nthe hours of 1.30 and 5 P.M. Winton had evidently no intention of trying\r\nto do so, for he hung about the corridor with a set face and an uneasy\r\nfoot. Yet it was law in the school, compared with which that of the\r\nMedes and Persians was no more than a non-committal resolution, that any\r\nboy, outside the First Fifteen, who missed his football for any reason\r\nwhatever, and had not a written excuse, duly signed by competent\r\nauthority to explain his absence, would receive not less than three\r\nstrokes with a ground-ash from the Captain of the Games, generally a\r\nyouth between seventeen and eighteen years, rarely under eleven stone\r\n('Pot' was nearer thirteen), and always in hard condition.\r\n\r\nKing knew without inquiry that the Head had given Winton no such excuse.\r\n\r\n'But he is practically a member of the First Fifteen. He has played for\r\nit all this term,' said King. 'I believe his Cap should have arrived\r\nlast week.'\r\n\r\n'His Cap has not been given him. Officially, therefore, he is naught. I\r\nrely on old Pot.'\r\n\r\n'But Mullins is Winton's study-mate,' King persisted.\r\n\r\nPot Mullins and Pater Winton were cousins and rather close friends.\r\n\r\n'That will make no difference to Mullins--or Winton, if I know 'em,'\r\nsaid the Head.\r\n\r\n'But--but,' King played his last card desperately, 'I was going to\r\nrecommend Winton for extra sub-prefect in my House, now Carton\r\nhas gone.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly,' said the Head. 'Why not? He will be excellent by tea-time,\r\nI hope.'\r\n\r\nAt that moment they saw Mr. Lidgett, tripping down the corridor, waylaid\r\nby Winton.\r\n\r\n'It's about that mouse-business at mechanical drawing,' Winton opened,\r\nswinging across his path.\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes, highly disgraceful,' Mr. Lidgett panted.\r\n\r\n'I know it was,' said Winton. 'It--it was a cad's trick because--'\r\n\r\n'Because you knew I couldn't give you more than fifty lines,' said Mr.\r\nLidgett.\r\n\r\n'Well, anyhow I've come to apologise for it.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly,' said Mr. Lidgett, and added, for he was a kindly man, 'I\r\nthink that shows quite right feeling. I'll tell the Head at once I'm\r\nsatisfied.'\r\n\r\n'No--no!' The boy's still unmended voice jumped from the growl to the\r\nsqueak. 'I didn't mean _that_! I--I did it on principle. Please\r\ndon't--er--do anything of that kind.'\r\n\r\nMr. Lidgett looked him up and down and, being an artist, understood.\r\n\r\n'Thank you, Winton,' he said. 'This shall be between ourselves.'\r\n\r\n'You heard?' said King, indecent pride in his voice.\r\n\r\n'Of course. You thought he was going to get Lidgett to beg him off the\r\nimpot.'\r\n\r\nKing denied this with so much warmth that the Head laughed and King went\r\naway in a huff.\r\n\r\n'By the way,' said the Head, 'I've told Winton to do his lines in your\r\nform-room--not in his study.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks,' said King over his shoulder, for the Head's orders had saved\r\nWinton and Mullins, who was doing extra Army work in the study, from an\r\nembarrassing afternoon together.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, King wandered into his still form-room as though by\r\naccident. Winton was hard at work.\r\n\r\n'Aha!' said King, rubbing his hands. 'This does not look like games,\r\nWinton. Don't let me arrest your facile pen. Whence this sudden love\r\nfor Virgil?'\r\n\r\n'Impot from the Head, sir, for that mouse-business this morning.'\r\n\r\n'Rumours thereof have reached us. That was a lapse on your part into\r\nLower Thirdery which I don't quite understand.'\r\n\r\nThe 'tump-tump' of the puntabouts before the sides settled to games came\r\nthrough the open window. Winton, like his House-Master, loved fresh air.\r\nThen they heard Paddy Vernon, sub-prefect on duty, calling the roll in\r\nthe field and marking defaulters. Winton wrote steadily. King curled\r\nhimself up on a desk, hands round knees. One would have said that the\r\nman was gloating over the boy's misfortune, but the boy understood.\r\n\r\n'_Dis te minorem quod geris imperas_,' King quoted presently. 'It is\r\nnecessary to bear oneself as lower than the local gods--even than\r\ndrawing-masters who are precluded from effective retaliation. I _do_\r\nwish you'd tried that mouse-game with me, Pater.'\r\n\r\nWinton grinned; then sobered 'It was a cad's trick, sir, to play on Mr.\r\nLidgett.' He peered forward at the page he was copying.\r\n\r\n'Well, \"the sin _I_ impute to each frustrate ghost\"--' King stopped\r\nhimself. 'Why do you goggle like an owl? Hand me the Mantuan and I'll\r\ndictate. No matter. Any rich Virgilian measures will serve. I may\r\nperadventure recall a few.' He began:\r\n\r\n     'Tu regere imperio populos Romane memento\r\n     Hae tibi erunt artes pacisque imponere morem,\r\n     Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos.\r\n\r\nThere you have it all, Winton. Write that out twice and yet once again.'\r\n\r\nFor the next forty minutes, with never a glance at the book, King paid\r\nout the glorious hexameters (and King could read Latin as though it were\r\nalive), Winton hauling them in and coiling them away behind him as\r\ntrimmers in a telegraph-ship's hold coil away deep-sea cable. King broke\r\nfrom the Aeneid to the Georgics and back again, pausing now and then to\r\ntranslate some specially loved line or to dwell on the treble-shot\r\ntexture of the ancient fabric. He did not allude to the coming interview\r\nwith Mullins except at the last, when he said, 'I think at this\r\njuncture, Pater, I need not ask you for the precise significance of\r\n_atqui sciebat quae sibi barbarus tortor_.'\r\n\r\nThe ungrateful Winton flushed angrily, and King loafed out to take five\r\no'clock call-over, after which he invited little Hartopp to tea and a\r\ntalk on chlorine-gas. Hartopp accepted the challenge like a bantam, and\r\nthe two went up to King's study about the same time as Winton returned\r\nto the form-room beneath it to finish his lines.\r\n\r\nThen half a dozen of the Second Fifteen, who should have been washing,\r\nstrolled in to condole with 'Pater' Winton, whose misfortune and its\r\nconsequences were common talk. No one was more sincere than the long,\r\nred-headed, knotty-knuckled 'Paddy' Vernon, but, being a careless\r\nanimal, he joggled Winton's desk.\r\n\r\n'Curse you for a silly ass!' said Winton. 'Don't do that.'\r\n\r\nNo one is expected to be polite while under punishment, so Vernon,\r\nsinking his sub-prefectship, replied peacefully enough:\r\n\r\n'Well, don't be wrathy, Pater.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not,' said Winton. 'Get out! This ain't your House form-room.'\r\n\r\n''Form-room don't belong to you. Why don't you go to your own study?'\r\nVernon replied.\r\n\r\n'Because Mullins is there waitin' for the victim,' said Stalky\r\ndelicately, and they all laughed. 'You ought to have shaken that mouse\r\nout of your trouser-leg, Pater. That's the way _I_ did in my youth.\r\nPater's revertin' to his second childhood. Never mind, Pater, we all\r\nrespect you and your future caree-ah.'\r\n\r\nWinton, still writhing, growled. Vernon leaning on the desk somehow\r\nshook it again. Then he laughed.\r\n\r\n'What are you grinning at?' Winton asked.\r\n\r\n'I was only thinkin' of _you_ being sent up to take a lickin' from Pot.\r\nI swear I don't think it's fair. You've never shirked a game in your\r\nlife, and you're as good as in the First Fifteen already. Your Cap ought\r\nto have been delivered last week, oughtn't it?'\r\n\r\nIt was law in the school that no man could by any means enjoy the\r\nprivileges and immunities of the First Fifteen till the black velvet cap\r\nwith the gold tassel, made by dilatory Exeter outfitters, had been\r\nactually set on his head. Ages ago, a large-built and unruly Second\r\nFifteen had attempted to change this law, but the prefects of that age\r\nwere still larger, and the lively experiment had never been repeated.\r\n\r\n'Will you,' said Winton very slowly, 'kindly mind your own damned\r\nbusiness, you cursed, clumsy, fat-headed fool?'\r\n\r\nThe form-room was as silent as the empty field in the darkness outside.\r\nVernon shifted his feet uneasily.\r\n\r\n'Well, _I_ shouldn't like to take a lickin' from Pot,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Wouldn't you?' Winton asked, as he paged the sheets of lines with hands\r\nthat shook.\r\n\r\n'No, I shouldn't,' said Vernon, his freckles growing more distinct on\r\nthe bridge of his white nose.\r\n\r\n'Well, I'm going to take it'--Winton moved clear of the desk as he\r\nspoke. 'But _you're_ going to take a lickin' from me first.' Before any\r\none realised it, he had flung himself neighing against Vernon. No\r\ndecencies were observed on either side, and the rest looked on amazed.\r\nThe two met confusedly, Vernon trying to do what he could with his\r\nlonger reach; Winton, insensible to blows, only concerned to drive his\r\nenemy into a corner and batter him to pulp. This he managed over against\r\nthe fire-place, where Vernon dropped half-stunned. 'Now I'm going to\r\ngive you your lickin',' said Winton. 'Lie there till I get a ground-ash\r\nand I'll cut you to pieces. If you move, I'll chuck you out of the\r\nwindow.' He wound his hands into the boy's collar and waistband, and had\r\nactually heaved him half off the ground before the others with one\r\naccord dropped on his head, shoulders, and legs. He fought them crazily\r\nin an awful hissing silence. Stalky's sensitive nose was rubbed along\r\nthe floor; Beetle received a jolt in the wind that sent him whistling\r\nand crowing against the wall; Perowne's forehead was cut, and Malpass\r\ncame out with an eye that explained itself like a dying rainbow through\r\na whole week.\r\n\r\n'Mad! Quite mad!' said Stalky, and for the third time wriggled back to\r\nWinton's throat. The door opened and King came in, Hartopp's little\r\nfigure just behind him. The mound on the floor panted and heaved but did\r\nnot rise, for Winton still squirmed vengefully. 'Only a little play,\r\nsir,' said Perowne. ''Only hit my head against a form.' This was\r\nquite true.\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said King. '_Dimovit obstantes propinquos._ You, I presume, are\r\nthe _populus_ delaying Winton's return to--Mullins, eh?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir,' said Stalky behind his claret-coloured handkerchief. 'We're\r\nthe _maerentes amicos_.'\r\n\r\n'Not bad! You see, some of it sticks after all,' King chuckled to\r\nHartopp, and the two masters left without further inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe boys sat still on the now-passive Winton.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Stalky at last, 'of all the putrid he-asses, Pater, you are\r\n_the_--'\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry. I'm awfully sorry,' Winton began, and they let him rise. He\r\nheld out his hand to the bruised and bewildered Vernon. 'Sorry, Paddy.\r\nI--I must have lost my temper. I--I don't know what's the matter\r\nwith me.'\r\n\r\n''Fat lot of good that'll do my face at tea,' Vernon grunted. 'Why\r\ncouldn't you say there was something wrong with you instead of lamming\r\nout like a lunatic? Is my lip puffy?'\r\n\r\n'Just a trifle. Look at my beak! Well, we got all these pretty marks at\r\nfooter--owin' to the zeal with which we played the game,' said Stalky,\r\ndusting himself. 'But d'you think you're fit to be let loose again,\r\nPater? 'Sure you don't want to kill another sub-prefect? I wish _I_ was\r\nPot. I'd cut your sprightly young soul out.'\r\n\r\n'I s'pose I ought to go to Pot now,' said Winton.\r\n\r\n'And let all the other asses see you lookin' like this! Not much. We'll\r\nall come up to Number Five Study and wash off in hot water. Beetle, you\r\naren't damaged. Go along and light the gas-stove.'\r\n\r\n'There's a tin of cocoa in my study somewhere,' Perowne shouted after\r\nhim. 'Rootle round till you find it, and take it up.'\r\n\r\nSeparately, by different roads, Vernon's jersey pulled half over his\r\nhead, the boys repaired to Number Five Study. Little Hartopp and King, I\r\nam sorry to say, leaned over the banisters of King's landing\r\nand watched.\r\n\r\n'Ve-ry human,' said little Hartopp. 'Your virtuous Winton, having got\r\nhimself into trouble, takes it out of my poor old Paddy. I wonder what\r\nprecise lie Paddy will tell about his face.'\r\n\r\n'But surely you aren't going to embarrass him by asking?' said King.\r\n\r\n'_Your_ boy won,' said Hartopp.\r\n\r\n'To go back to what we were discussing,' said King quickly, 'do you\r\npretend that your modern system of inculcating unrelated facts about\r\nchlorine, for instance, all of which may be proved fallacies by the time\r\nthe boys grow up, can have any real bearing on education--even the low\r\ntype of it that examiners expect?'\r\n\r\n'I maintain nothing. But is it any worse than your Chinese reiteration\r\nof uncomprehended syllables in a dead tongue?'\r\n\r\n'Dead, forsooth!' King fairly danced. 'The only living tongue on earth!\r\nChinese! On my word, Hartopp!'\r\n\r\n'And at the end of seven years--how often have I said it?' Hartopp went\r\non,--'seven years of two hundred and twenty days of six hours each, your\r\nvictims go away with nothing, absolutely nothing, except, perhaps, if\r\nthey've been very attentive, a dozen--no, I'll grant you twenty--one\r\nscore of totally unrelated Latin tags which any child of twelve could\r\nhave absorbed in two terms.'\r\n\r\n'But--but can't you realise that if our system brings later--at any\r\nrate--at a pinch--a simple understanding--grammar and Latinity apart--a\r\nmere glimpse of the significance (foul word!) of, we'll say, one Ode of\r\nHorace, one twenty lines of Virgil, we've got what we poor devils of\r\nushers are striving after?'\r\n\r\n'And what might that be?' said Hartopp.\r\n\r\n'Balance, proportion, perspective--life. Your scientific man is the\r\nunrelated animal--the beast without background. Haven't you ever\r\nrealised _that_ in your atmosphere of stinks?'\r\n\r\n'Meantime you make them lose life for the sake of living, eh?'\r\n\r\n'Blind again, Hartopp! I told you about Paddy's quotation this morning.\r\n(But he made _probrosis_ a verb, he did!) You yourself heard young\r\nCorkran's reference to _maerentes amicos_. It sticks--a little of it\r\nsticks among the barbarians.'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely and essentially Chinese,' said little Hartopp, who, alone of\r\nthe common-room, refused to be outfaced by King. 'But I don't yet\r\nunderstand how Paddy came to be licked by Winton. Paddy's supposed to be\r\nsomething of a boxer.'\r\n\r\n'Beware of vinegar made from honey,' King replied. 'Pater, like some\r\nother people, is patient and long-suffering, but he has his limits. The\r\nHead is oppressing him damnably, too. As I pointed out, the boy has\r\npractically been in the First Fifteen since term began.'\r\n\r\n'But, my dear fellow, I've known you give a boy an impot and refuse him\r\nleave off games, again and again.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, but that was when there was real need to get at some oaf who\r\ncouldn't be sensitised in any other way. Now, in our esteemed Head's\r\naction I see nothing but--'\r\n\r\nThe conversation from this point does not concern us.\r\n\r\nMeantime Winton, very penitent and especially polite towards Vernon, was\r\nbeing cheered with cocoa in Number Five Study. They had some difficulty\r\nin stemming the flood of his apologies. He himself pointed out to Vernon\r\nthat he had attacked a sub-prefect for no reason whatever, and,\r\ntherefore, deserved official punishment.\r\n\r\n'I can't think what was the matter with me to-day,' he mourned. 'Ever\r\nsince that blasted mouse-business--'\r\n\r\n'Well, then, don't think,' said Stalky. 'Or do you want Paddy to make a\r\nrow about it before all the school?'\r\n\r\nHere Vernon was understood to say that he would see Winton and all the\r\nschool somewhere else.\r\n\r\n'And if you imagine Perowne and Malpass and me are goin' to give\r\nevidence at a prefects' meeting just to soothe your beastly conscience,\r\nyou jolly well err,' said Beetle. 'I know what you did.'\r\n\r\n'What?' croaked Pater, out of the valley of his humiliation.\r\n\r\n'You went Berserk. I've read all about it in _Hypatia_.'\r\n\r\n'What's \"going Berserk\"?' Winton asked.\r\n\r\n'Never you mind,' was the reply. 'Now, don't you feel awfully weak and\r\nseedy?'\r\n\r\n'I _am_ rather tired,' said Winton, sighing.\r\n\r\n'That's what you ought to be. You've gone Berserk and pretty soon you'll\r\ngo to sleep. But you'll probably be liable to fits of it all your life,'\r\nBeetle concluded. ''Shouldn't wonder if you murdered some one some day.'\r\n\r\n'Shut up--you and your Berserks!' said Stalky. 'Go to Mullins now and\r\nget it over, Pater.'\r\n\r\n'I call it filthy unjust of the Head,' said Vernon. 'Anyhow, you've\r\ngiven me my lickin', old man. I hope Pot'll give you yours.'\r\n\r\n'I'm awfully sorry--awfully sorry,' was Winton's last word.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in that consulship to deal with games' defaulters\r\nbetween five o'clock call-over and tea. Mullins, who was old enough to\r\npity, did not believe in letting boys wait through the night till the\r\nchill of the next morning for their punishments. He was finishing off\r\nthe last of the small fry and their excuses when Winton arrived.\r\n\r\n'But, please, Mullins'--this was Babcock tertius, a dear little\r\ntwelve-year-old mother's darling--'I had an awful hack on the knee. I've\r\nbeen to the Matron about it and she gave me some iodine. I've been\r\nrubbing it in all day. I thought that would be an excuse off.'\r\n\r\n'Let's have a look at it,' said the impassive Mullins. 'That's a\r\nshin-bruise--about a week old. Touch your toes. I'll give you\r\nthe iodine.'\r\n\r\nBabcock yelled loudly as he had many times before. The face of Jevons,\r\naged eleven, a new boy that dark wet term, low in the House, low in the\r\nLower School, and lowest of all in his home-sick little mind turned\r\nwhite at the horror of the sight. They could hear his working lips part\r\nstickily as Babcock wailed his way out of hearing.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Jevons! What brings you here?' said Mullins.\r\n\r\n'Pl-ease, sir, I went for a walk with Babcock tertius.'\r\n\r\n'Did you? Then I bet you went to the tuck-shop--and you paid, didn't\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\nA nod. Jevons was too terrified to speak.\r\n\r\n'Of course, and I bet Babcock told you that old Pot 'ud let you off\r\nbecause it was the first time.'\r\n\r\nAnother nod with a ghost of a smile in it.\r\n\r\n'All right.' Mullins picked Jevons up before he could guess what was\r\ncoming, laid him on the table with one hand, with the other gave him\r\nthree emphatic spanks, then held him high in air.\r\n\r\n'Now you tell Babcock tertius that he's got you a licking from me, and\r\nsee you jolly well pay it back to him. And when you're prefect of games\r\ndon't you let any one shirk his footer without a written excuse. Where\r\nd'you play in your game?'\r\n\r\n'Forward, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You can do better than that. I've seen you run like a young\r\nbuck-rabbit. Ask Dickson from me to try you as three-quarter next game,\r\nwill you? Cut along.'\r\n\r\nJevons left, warm for the first time that day, enormously set up in his\r\nown esteem, and very hot against the deceitful Babcock.\r\n\r\nMullins turned to Winton. 'Your name's on the list, Pater.' Winton\r\nnodded.\r\n\r\n'I know it. The Head landed me with an impot for that mouse-business at\r\nmechanical drawing. No excuse.'\r\n\r\n'He meant it then?' Mullins jerked his head delicately towards the\r\nground-ash on the table. 'I heard something about it.'\r\n\r\nWinton nodded. 'A rotten thing to do,' he said. 'Can't think what I was\r\ndoing ever to do it. It counts against a fellow so; and there's some\r\nmore too--'\r\n\r\n'All right, Pater. Just stand clear of our photo-bracket, will you?'\r\n\r\nThe little formality over, there was a pause. Winton swung round, yawned\r\nin Pot's astonished face and staggered towards the window-seat.\r\n\r\n'What's the matter with you, Dick? Ill?'\r\n\r\n'No. Perfectly all right, thanks. Only--only a little sleepy.' Winton\r\nstretched himself out, and then and there fell deeply and\r\nplacidly asleep.\r\n\r\n'It isn't a faint,' said the experienced Mullins, 'or his pulse wouldn't\r\nact. 'Tisn't a fit or he'd snort and twitch. It can't be sunstroke, this\r\nterm, and he hasn't been over-training for anything.' He opened Winton's\r\ncollar, packed a cushion under his head, threw a rug over him and sat\r\ndown to listen to the regular breathing. Before long Stalky arrived, on\r\npretence of borrowing a book. He looked at the window-seat.\r\n\r\n''Noticed anything wrong with Winton lately?' said Mullins.\r\n\r\n''Notice anything wrong with my beak?' Stalky replied. 'Pater went\r\nBerserk after call-over, and fell on a lot of us for jesting with him\r\nabout his impot. You ought to see Malpass's eye.'\r\n\r\n'You mean that Pater fought?' said Mullins.\r\n\r\n'Like a devil. Then he nearly went to sleep in our study just now. I\r\nexpect he'll be all right when he wakes up. Rummy business!\r\nConscientious old bargee. You ought to have heard his apologies.'\r\n\r\n'But Pater can't fight one little bit,' Mullins repeated.\r\n\r\n''Twasn't fighting. He just tried to murder every one.' Stalky described\r\nthe affair, and when he left Mullins went off to take counsel with the\r\nHead, who, out of a cloud of blue smoke, told him that all would yet\r\nbe well.\r\n\r\n'Winton,' said he, 'is a little stiff in his moral joints. He'll get\r\nover that. If he asks you whether to-day's doings will count against\r\nhim in his--'\r\n\r\n'But you know it's important to him, sir. His people aren't--very well\r\noff,' said Mullins.\r\n\r\n'That's why I'm taking all this trouble. You must reassure him, Pot. I\r\nhave overcrowded him with new experiences. Oh, by the way, has his\r\nCap come?'\r\n\r\n'It came at dinner, sir.' Mullins laughed.\r\n\r\nSure enough, when he waked at tea-time, Winton proposed to take Mullins\r\nall through every one of his day's lapses from grace, and 'Do you think\r\nit will count against me?' said he.\r\n\r\n'Don't you fuss so much about yourself and your silly career,' said\r\nMullins. 'You're all right. And oh--here's your First Cap at last. Shove\r\nit up on the bracket and come on to tea.'\r\n\r\nThey met King on their way, stepping statelily and rubbing his hands. 'I\r\nhave applied,' said he, 'for the services of an additional sub-prefect\r\nin Carton's unlamented absence. Your name, Winton, seems to have found\r\nfavour with the powers that be, and--and all things considered--I am\r\ndisposed to give my support to the nomination. You are therefore a\r\nquasi-lictor.'\r\n\r\n'Then it didn't count against me,' Winton gasped as soon as they were\r\nout of hearing.\r\n\r\nA Captain of Games can jest with a sub-prefect publicly.\r\n\r\n'You utter ass!' said Mullins, and caught him by the back of his stiff\r\nneck and ran him down to the hall where the sub-prefects, who sit below\r\nthe salt, made him welcome with the economical bloater-paste\r\nof mid-term.\r\n\r\nKing and little Hartopp were sparring in the Reverend John Gillett's\r\nstudy at 10 P.M.--classical _versus_ modern as usual.\r\n\r\n'Character--proportion--background,' snarled King. 'That is the essence\r\nof the Humanities.'\r\n\r\n'Analects of Confucius,' little Hartopp answered.\r\n\r\n'Time,' said the Reverend John behind the soda-water. 'You men oppress\r\nme. Hartopp, what did you say to Paddy in your dormitories to-night?\r\nEven _you_ couldn't have overlooked his face.'\r\n\r\n'But I did,' said Hartopp calmly. 'I wasn't even humorous about it as\r\nsome clerics might have been. I went straight through and said naught.'\r\n\r\n'Poor Paddy! Now, for my part,' said King, 'and you know I am not lavish\r\nin my praises, I consider Winton a first-class type; absolutely\r\nfirst-class.'\r\n\r\n'Ha-ardly,' said the Reverend John. 'First-class of the second class, I\r\nadmit. The very best type of second class but'--he shook his head--'it\r\nshould have been a rat. Pater'll never be anything more than a Colonel\r\nof Engineers.'\r\n\r\n'What do you base that verdict on?' said King stiffly.\r\n\r\n'He came to me after prayers--with all his conscience.'\r\n\r\n'Poor old Pater. Was it the mouse?' said little Hartopp.\r\n\r\n'That, and what he called his uncontrollable temper, and his\r\nresponsibilities as sub-prefect.'\r\n\r\n'And you?'\r\n\r\n'If we had had what is vulgarly called a pi-jaw he'd have had\r\nhysterics. So I recommended a dose of Epsom salts. He'll take it,\r\ntoo--conscientiously. Don't eat me, King. Perhaps, he'll be a K.C.B.'\r\n\r\nTen o'clock struck and the Army class boys in the further studies coming\r\nto their houses after an hour's extra work passed along the gravel path\r\nbelow. Some one was chanting, to the tune of 'White sand and grey sand,'\r\n_Dis te minorem quod geris imperas_. He stopped outside Mullins' study.\r\nThey heard Mullins' window slide up and then Stalky's voice:\r\n\r\n'Ah! Good-evening, Mullins, my _barbarus tortor_. We're the waits. We\r\nhave come to inquire after the local Berserk. Is he doin' as well as can\r\nbe expected in his new caree-ah?'\r\n\r\n'Better than you will, in a sec, Stalky,' Mullins grunted.\r\n\r\n'Glad of that. We thought he'd like to know that Paddy has been carried\r\nto the sick-house in ravin' delirium. They think it's concussion of\r\nthe brain.'\r\n\r\n'Why, he was all right at prayers,' Winton began earnestly, and they\r\nheard a laugh in the background as Mullins slammed down the window.\r\n\r\n''Night, Regulus,' Stalky sang out, and the light footsteps went on.\r\n\r\n'You see. It sticks. A little of it sticks among the barbarians,' said\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n'Amen,' said the Reverend John. 'Go to bed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRANSLATION\r\n\r\nHORACE, Bk. V. _Ode 3_\r\n\r\n     There are whose study is of smells,\r\n       And to attentive schools rehearse\r\n     How something mixed with something else\r\n       Makes something worse.\r\n\r\n     Some cultivate in broths impure\r\n       The clients of our body--these,\r\n     Increasing without Venus, cure,\r\n       Or cause, disease.\r\n\r\n     Others the heated wheel extol,\r\n       And all its offspring, whose concern\r\n     Is how to make it farthest roll\r\n       And fastest turn.\r\n\r\n     Me, much incurious if the hour\r\n       Present, or to be paid for, brings\r\n     Me to Brundusium by the power\r\n       Of wheels or wings;\r\n\r\n     Me, in whose breast no flame hath burned\r\n       Life-long, save that by Pindar lit,\r\n     Such lore leaves cold: I am not turned\r\n       Aside to it\r\n\r\n     More than when, sunk in thought profound\r\n       Of what the unaltering Gods require,\r\n     My steward (friend but slave) brings round\r\n       Logs for my fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Edge of the Evening\r\n\r\n(1913)\r\n\r\n     Ah! What avails the classic bent,\r\n       And what the chosen word,\r\n     Against the undoctored incident\r\n       That actually occurred?\r\n\r\n     And what is Art whereto we press\r\n       Through paint and prose and rhyme--\r\n     When Nature in her nakedness\r\n       Defeats us every time?\r\n\r\n'Hi! Hi! Hold your horses! Stop!... Well! Well!' A lean man in a\r\nsable-lined overcoat leaped from a private car and barred my way up Pall\r\nMall. 'You don't know me? You're excusable. I wasn't wearing much of\r\nanything last time we met--in South Africa.'\r\n\r\nThe scales fell from my eyes, and I saw him once more in a sky-blue army\r\nshirt, behind barbed wire, among Dutch prisoners bathing at Simonstown,\r\nmore than a dozen years ago[3]. 'Why, it's Zigler--Laughton O. Zigler!'\r\nI cried. 'Well, I _am_ glad to see you.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: 'The Captive': _Traffics and Discoveries_.]\r\n\r\n'Oh no! You don't work any of your English on me. \"So glad to see you,\r\ndoncher know--an' ta-ta!\" Do you reside in this village?'\r\n\r\n'No. I'm up here buying stores.'\r\n\r\n'Then you take my automobile. Where to?... Oh, I know _them_! My Lord\r\nMarshalton is one of the Directors. Pigott, drive to the Army and Navy\r\nCooperative Supply Association Limited, Victoria Street, Westminister.'\r\n\r\nHe settled himself on the deep dove-colour pneumatic cushions, and his\r\nsmile was like the turning on of all the electrics. His teeth were\r\nwhiter than the ivory fittings. He smelt of rare soap and\r\ncigarettes--such cigarettes as he handed me from a golden box with an\r\nautomatic lighter. On my side of the car was a gold-mounted mirror, card\r\nand toilette case. I looked at him inquiringly.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he nodded, 'two years after I quit the Cape. She's not an Ohio\r\ngirl, though. She's in the country now. Is that right? She's at our\r\nlittle place in the country. We'll go there as soon as you're through\r\nwith your grocery-list. Engagements? The only engagement you've got is\r\nto grab your grip--get your bag from your hotel, I mean--and come right\r\nalong and meet her. You are the captive of _my_ bow and spear now.'\r\n\r\n'I surrender,' I said meekly. 'Did the Zigler automatic gun do all\r\nthis?' I pointed to the car fittings.\r\n\r\n'Psha! Think of your rememberin' that! Well, no. The Zigler is a great\r\ngun--the greatest ever--but life's too short, an' too interestin', to\r\nsquander on pushing her in military society. I've leased my rights in\r\nher to a Pennsylvanian-Transylvanian citizen full of mentality and moral\r\nuplift. If those things weigh with the Chancelleries of Europe, he will\r\nmake good and--I shall be surprised. Excuse me!'\r\n\r\nHe bared his head as we passed the statue of the Great Queen outside\r\nBuckingham Palace.\r\n\r\n'A very great lady!' said he. 'I have enjoyed her hospitality. She\r\nrepresents one of the most wonderful institutions in the world. The next\r\nis the one we are going to. Mrs. Zigler uses 'em, and they break her up\r\nevery week on returned empties.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, you mean the Stores?' I said.\r\n\r\n'Mrs. Zigler means it more. They are quite ambassadorial in their\r\noutlook. I guess I'll wait outside and pray while you wrestle with 'em.'\r\n\r\nMy business at the Stores finished, and my bag retrieved from the hotel,\r\nhis moving palace slid us into the country.\r\n\r\n'I owe it to you,' Zigler began as smoothly as the car, 'to tell you\r\nwhat I am now. I represent the business end of the American Invasion.\r\nNot the blame cars themselves--I wouldn't be found dead in one--but the\r\ntools that make 'em. I am the Zigler Higher-Speed Tool and Lathe Trust.\r\nThe Trust, sir, is entirely my own--in my own inventions. I am the\r\nRenzalaer ten-cylinder aërial--the lightest aeroplane-engine on the\r\nmarket--one price, one power, one guarantee. I am the Orlebar\r\nPaper-welt, Pulp-panel Company for aeroplane bodies; and I am the Rush\r\nSilencer for military aeroplanes--absolutely silent--which the Continent\r\nleases under royalty. With three exceptions, the British aren't wise to\r\nit yet. That's all I represent at present. You saw me take off my hat\r\nto your late Queen? I owe every cent I have to that great an' good Lady.\r\nYes, sir, I came out of Africa, after my eighteen months' rest-cure and\r\nopen-air treatment and sea-bathing, as her prisoner of war, like a giant\r\nrefreshed. There wasn't anything could hold me, when I'd got my hooks\r\ninto it, after that experience. And to you as a representative British\r\ncitizen, I say here and now that I regard you as the founder of the\r\nfamily fortune--Tommy's and mine.'\r\n\r\n'But I only gave you some papers and tobacco.'\r\n\r\n'What more does any citizen need? The Cullinan diamond wouldn't have\r\nhelped me as much then; an'--talking about South Africa, tell me--'\r\n\r\nWe talked about South Africa till the car stopped at the Georgian lodge\r\nof a great park.\r\n\r\n'We'll get out here. I want to show you a rather sightly view,' said\r\nZigler.\r\n\r\nWe walked, perhaps, half a mile, across timber-dotted turf, past a lake,\r\nentered a dark rhododendron-planted wood, ticking with the noise of\r\npheasants' feet, and came out suddenly, where five rides met, at a small\r\nclassic temple between lichened stucco statues which faced a circle of\r\nturf, several acres in extent. Irish yews, of a size that I had never\r\nseen before, walled the sunless circle like cliffs of riven obsidian,\r\nexcept at the lower end, where it gave on to a stretch of undulating\r\nbare ground ending in a timbered slope half-a-mile away.\r\n\r\n'That's where the old Marshalton race-course used to be,' said Zigler.\r\n'That ice-house is called Flora's Temple. Nell Gwynne and Mrs. Siddons\r\nan' Taglioni an' all that crowd used to act plays here for King George\r\nthe Third. Wasn't it? Well, George is the only king I play. Let it go at\r\nthat. This circle was the stage, I guess. The kings an' the nobility sat\r\nin Flora's Temple. I forget who sculped these statues at the door.\r\nThey're the Comic and Tragic Muse. But it's a sightly view, ain't it?'\r\n\r\nThe sunlight was leaving the park. I caught a glint of silver to the\r\nsouthward beyond the wooded ridge.\r\n\r\n'That's the ocean--the Channel, I mean,' said Zigler. 'It's twenty-three\r\nmiles as a man flies. A sightly view, ain't it?'\r\n\r\nI looked at the severe yews, the dumb yelling mouths of the two statues,\r\nat the blue-green shadows on the unsunned grass, and at the still bright\r\nplain in front where some deer were feeding.\r\n\r\n'It's a most dramatic contrast, but I think it would be better on a\r\nsummer's day,' I said, and we went on, up one of the noiseless rides, a\r\nquarter of a mile at least, till we came to the porticoed front of an\r\nenormous Georgian pile. Four footmen revealed themselves in a hall hung\r\nwith pictures.\r\n\r\n'I hired this off of my Lord Marshalton,' Zigler explained, while they\r\nhelped us out of our coats under the severe eyes of ruffed and\r\nperiwigged ancestors. 'Ya-as. They always look at _me_ too, as if I'd\r\nblown in from the gutter. Which, of course, I have. That's Mary, Lady\r\nMarshalton. Old man Joshua painted her. Do you see any likeness to my\r\nLord Marshalton? Why, haven't you ever met up with him? He was Captain\r\nMankeltow--my Royal British Artillery captain that blew up my gun in the\r\nwar, an' then tried to bury me against my religious principles[4].\r\nYa-as. His father died and he got the lordship. That was about all he\r\ngot by the time that your British death-duties were through with him. So\r\nhe said I'd oblige him by hiring his ranch. It's a hell an' a half of a\r\nproposition to handle, but Tommy--Mrs. Laughton--understands it. Come\r\nright in to the parlour and be very welcome.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"The Captive\": _Traffics and Discoveries_.]\r\n\r\nHe guided me, hand on shoulder, into a babble of high-pitched talk and\r\nlaughter that filled a vast drawing-room. He introduced me as the\r\nfounder of the family fortunes to a little, lithe, dark-eyed woman whose\r\nspeech and greeting were of the soft-lipped South. She in turn presented\r\nme to her mother, a black-browed snowy-haired old lady with a cap of\r\npriceless Venetian point, hands that must have held many hearts in their\r\ntime, and a dignity as unquestioned and unquestioning as an empress. She\r\nwas, indeed, a Burton of Savannah, who, on their own ground, out-rank\r\nthe Lees of Virginia. The rest of the company came from Buffalo,\r\nCincinnati, Cleveland and Chicago, with here and there a softening\r\nsouthern strain. A party of young folk popped corn beneath a mantelpiece\r\nsurmounted by a Gainsborough. Two portly men, half hidden by a cased\r\nharp, discussed, over sheaves of typewritten documents, the terms of\r\nsome contract. A knot of matrons talked servants--Irish _versus_\r\nGerman--across the grand piano. A youth ravaged an old bookcase, while\r\nbeside him a tall girl stared at the portrait of a woman of many loves,\r\ndead three hundred years, but now leaping to life and warning under the\r\nshaded frame-light. In a corner half-a-dozen girls examined the glazed\r\ntables that held the decorations--English and foreign--of the late Lord\r\nMarshalton.\r\n\r\n'See heah! Would this be the Ordeh of the Gyartah?' one said, pointing.\r\n\r\n'I presoom likely. No! The Garter has \"_Honey swore_\"--I know that much.\r\nThis is \"Tria juncta\" something.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, what's that cunning little copper cross with \"For Valurr\"?' a third\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n'Say! Look at here!' said the young man at the bookcase. 'Here's a first\r\nedition of _Handley Cross_ and a Beewick's _Birds_ right next to\r\nit--just like so many best sellers. Look, Maidie!'\r\n\r\nThe girl beneath the picture half turned her body but not her eyes.\r\n\r\n'You don't tell _me_!' she said slowly. 'Their women amounted to\r\nsomething after all.'\r\n\r\n'But Woman's scope, and outlook was vurry limmutted in those days,' one\r\nof the matrons put in, from the piano.\r\n\r\n'Limmutted? For _her_? If they whurr, I guess she was the limmut. Who\r\nwas she? Peters, whurr's the cat'log?'\r\n\r\nA thin butler, in charge of two footmen removing the tea-batteries, slid\r\nto a table and handed her a blue-and-qilt book. He was button-holed by\r\none of the men behind the harp, who wished to get a telephone call\r\nthrough to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n'The local office shuts at six,' said Peters. 'But I can get through\r\nto'--he named some town--'in ten minutes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'That suits me. You'll find me here when you've hitched up. Oh, say,\r\nPeters! We--Mister Olpherts an' me--ain't goin' by that early morning\r\ntrain to-morrow--but the other one--on the other line--whatever\r\nthey call it.'\r\n\r\n'The nine twenty-seven, sir. Yes, sir. Early breakfast will be at\r\nhalf-past eight and the car will be at the door at nine.'\r\n\r\n'Peters!' an imperious young voice called. 'What's the matteh with Lord\r\nMarshalton's Ordeh of the Gyartah? We cyan't find it anyweah.'\r\n\r\n'Well, miss, I _have_ heard that that Order is usually returned to His\r\nMajesty on the death of the holder. Yes, miss.' Then in a whisper to a\r\nfootman, 'More butter for the pop-corn in King Charles's Corner.' He\r\nstopped behind my chair. 'Your room is Number Eleven, sir. May I trouble\r\nyou for your keys?'\r\n\r\nHe left the room with a six-year-old maiden called Alice who had\r\nannounced she would not go to bed ''less Peter, Peter, Punkin-eater\r\ntakes me--so there!'\r\n\r\nHe very kindly looked in on me for a moment as I was dressing for\r\ndinner. 'Not at all, sir,' he replied to some compliment I paid him. 'I\r\nvaleted the late Lord Marshalton for fifteen years. He was very abrupt\r\nin his movements, sir. As a rule I never received more than an hour's\r\nnotice of a journey. We used to go to Syria frequently. I have been\r\ntwice to Babylon. Mr. and Mrs. Zigler's requirements are, comparatively\r\nspeaking, few.'\r\n\r\n'But the guests?'\r\n\r\n'Very little out of the ordinary as soon as one knows their ordinaries.\r\nExtremely simple, if I may say so, sir.'\r\n\r\nI had the privilege of taking Mrs. Burton in to dinner, and was rewarded\r\nwith an entirely new, and to me rather shocking view, of Abraham\r\nLincoln, who, she said, had wasted the heritage of his land by blood and\r\nfire, and had surrendered the remnant to aliens. 'My brother, suh,' she\r\nsaid, 'fell at Gettysburg in order that Armenians should colonise New\r\nEngland to-day. If I took any interest in any dam-Yankee outside of my\r\nson-in-law Laughton yondah, I should say that my brother's death had\r\nbeen amply avenged.'\r\n\r\nThe man at her right took up the challenge, and the war spread. Her eyes\r\ntwinkled over the flames she had lit.\r\n\r\n'Don't these folk,' she said a little later, 'remind you of Arabs\r\npicnicking under the Pyramids?'\r\n\r\n'I've never seen the Pyramids,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Hm! I didn't know you were as English as all that.' And when I laughed,\r\n'Are you?'\r\n\r\n'Always. It saves trouble.'\r\n\r\n'Now that's just what I find so significant among the English'--this was\r\nAlice's mother, I think, with one elbow well forward among the salted\r\nalmonds. 'Oh, I know how _you_ feel, Madam Burton, but a Northerner\r\nlike myself--I'm Buffalo--even though we come over every year--notices\r\nthe desire for comfort in England. There's so little conflict or uplift\r\nin British society.'\r\n\r\n'But we like being comfortable,' I said.\r\n\r\n'I know it. It's very characteristic. But ain't it a little, just a\r\nlittle, lacking in adaptability an' imagination?'\r\n\r\n'They haven't any need for adaptability,' Madam Burton struck in. 'They\r\nhaven't any Ellis Island standards to live up to.'\r\n\r\n'But we can assimilate,' the Buffalo woman charged on.\r\n\r\n'Now you _have_ done it!' I whispered to the old lady as the blessed\r\nword 'assimilation' woke up all the old arguments for and against.\r\n\r\nThere was not a dull moment in that dinner for me--nor afterwards when\r\nthe boys and girls at the piano played the rag-time tunes of their own\r\nland, while their elders, inexhaustibly interested, replunged into the\r\ndiscussion of that land's future, till there was talk of coon-can. When\r\nall the company had been set to tables Zigler led me into his book-lined\r\nstudy, where I noticed he kept his golf-clubs, and spoke simply as a\r\nchild, gravely as a bishop, of the years that were past since our\r\nlast meeting.\r\n\r\n'That's about all, I guess--up to date,' he said when he had unrolled\r\nthe bright map of his fortunes across three continents. 'Bein' rich\r\nsuits me. So does your country, sir. My own country? You heard what\r\nthat Detroit man said at dinner. \"A Government of the alien, by the\r\nalien, for the alien.\" Mother's right, too. Lincoln killed us. From the\r\nhighest motives--but he killed us. Oh, say, that reminds me. 'J'ever\r\nkill a man from the highest motives?'\r\n\r\n'Not from any motive--as far as I remember.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I have. It don't weigh on my mind any, but it was interesting.\r\nLife _is_ interesting for a rich--for any--man in England. Ya-as! Life\r\nin England is like settin' in the front row at the theatre and never\r\nknowin' when the whole blame drama won't spill itself into your lap. I\r\ndidn't always know that. I lie abed now, and I blush to think of some of\r\nthe breaks I made in South Africa. About the British. Not your official\r\nmethod of doin' business. But the Spirit. I was 'way, 'way off on the\r\nSpirit. Are you acquainted with any other country where you'd have to\r\nkill a man or two to get at the National Spirit?'\r\n\r\n'Well,' I answered, 'next to marrying one of its women, killing one of\r\nits men makes for pretty close intimacy with any country. I take it you\r\nkilled a British citizen.'\r\n\r\n'Why, no. Our syndicate confined its operations to aliens--dam-fool\r\naliens.... 'J'ever know an English lord called Lundie[5]? Looks like a\r\nframe-food and soap advertisement. I imagine he was in your Supreme\r\nCourt before he came into his lordship.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: 'The Puzzler': _Actions and Reactions_.]\r\n\r\n'He is a lawyer--what we call a Law Lord--a Judge of Appeal--not a real\r\nhereditary lord.'\r\n\r\n'That's as much beyond me as _this_!' Zigler slapped a fat Debrett on\r\nthe table. 'But I presoom this unreal Law Lord Lundie is kind o' real in\r\nhis decisions? I judged so. And--one more question. 'Ever meet a man\r\ncalled Walen?'\r\n\r\n'D'you mean Burton-Walen, the editor of--?' I mentioned the journal.\r\n\r\n'That's him. 'Looks like a tough, talks like a Maxim, and trains with\r\nkings.'\r\n\r\n'He does,' I said. 'Burton-Walen knows all the crowned heads of Europe\r\nintimately. It's his hobby.'\r\n\r\n'Well, there's the whole outfit for you--exceptin' my Lord Marshalton,\r\n_né_ Mankeltow, an' me. All active murderers--specially the Law Lord--or\r\naccessories after the fact. And what do they hand you out for _that_, in\r\nthis country?'\r\n\r\n'Twenty years, I believe,' was my reply.\r\n\r\nHe reflected a moment.\r\n\r\n'No-o-o,' he said, and followed it with a smoke-ring. 'Twenty months at\r\nthe Cape is my limit. Say, murder ain't the soul-shatterin' event those\r\nnature-fakers in the magazines make out. It develops naturally like any\r\nother proposition.... Say, 'j'ever play this golf game? It's come up in\r\nthe States from Maine to California, an' we're prodoocin' all the\r\nchampions in sight. Not a business man's play, but interestin'. I've got\r\na golf-links in the park here that they tell me is the finest inland\r\ncourse ever. I had to pay extra for that when I hired the ranche--last\r\nyear. It was just before I signed the papers that our murder\r\neventuated. My Lord Marshalton he asked me down for the week-end to fix\r\nup something or other--about Peters and the linen, I think 'twas. Mrs.\r\nZigler took a holt of the proposition. She understood Peters from the\r\nword \"go.\" There wasn't any house-party; only fifteen or twenty folk. A\r\nfull house is thirty-two, Tommy tells me. 'Guess we must be near on that\r\nto-night. In the smoking-room here, my Lord Marshalton--Mankeltow that\r\nwas--introduces me to this Walen man with the nose. He'd been in the War\r\ntoo, from start to finish. He knew all the columns and generals that I'd\r\nbattled with in the days of my Zigler gun. We kinder fell into each\r\nother's arms an' let the harsh world go by for a while.\r\n\r\n'Walen he introduces me to your Lord Lundie. _He_ was a new proposition\r\nto me. If he hadn't been a lawyer he'd have made a lovely cattle-king. I\r\nthought I had played poker some. Another of my breaks. Ya-as! It cost me\r\neleven hundred dollars besides what Tommy said when I retired. I have no\r\nfault to find with your hereditary aristocracy, or your judiciary, or\r\nyour press.\r\n\r\n'Sunday we all went to Church across the Park here.... Psha! Think o'\r\nyour rememberin' my religion! I've become an Episcopalian since I\r\nmarried. Ya-as.... After lunch Walen did his crowned-heads-of-Europe\r\nstunt in the smokin'-room here. He was long on Kings. And Continental\r\ncrises. I do not pretend to follow British domestic politics, but in the\r\naeroplane business a man has to know something of international\r\npossibilities. At present, you British are settin' in kimonoes on\r\ndynamite kegs. Walen's talk put me wise on the location and size of some\r\nof the kegs. Ya-as!\r\n\r\n'After that, we four went out to look at those golf-links I was hirin'.\r\nWe each took a club. Mine'--he glanced at a great tan bag by the\r\nfire-place--'was the beginner's friend--the cleek. Well, sir, this golf\r\nproposition took a holt of me as quick as--quick as death. They had to\r\nprise me off the greens when it got too dark to see, and then we went\r\nback to the house. I was walkin' ahead with my Lord Marshalton talkin'\r\nbeginners' golf. (_I_ was the man who ought to have been killed by\r\nrights.) We cut 'cross lots through the woods to Flora's Temple--that\r\nplace I showed you this afternoon. Lundie and Walen were, maybe, twenty\r\nor thirty rod behind us in the dark. Marshalton and I stopped at the\r\ntheatre to admire at the ancestral yew-trees. He took me right under the\r\nbiggest--King Somebody's Yew--and while I was spannin' it with my\r\nhandkerchief, he says, \"Look heah!\" just as if it was a rabbit--and down\r\ncomes a bi-plane into the theatre with no more noise than the dead. My\r\nRush Silencer is the only one on the market that allows that sort of\r\ngumshoe work.... What? A bi-plane--with two men in it. Both men jump out\r\nand start fussin' with the engines. I was starting to tell Mankeltow--I\r\ncan't remember to call him Marshalton any more--that it looked as if the\r\nRoyal British Flying Corps had got on to my Rush Silencer at last; but\r\nhe steps out from under the yew to these two Stealthy Steves and says,\r\n\"What's the trouble? Can I be of any service?\" He thought--so did\r\nI--'twas some of the boys from Aldershot or Salisbury. Well, sir, from\r\nthere on, the situation developed like a motion-picture in Hell. The man\r\non the nigh side of the machine whirls round, pulls his gun and fires\r\ninto Mankeltow's face. I laid him out with my cleek automatically. Any\r\none who shoots a friend of mine gets what's comin' to him if I'm within\r\nreach. He drops. Mankeltow rubs his neck with his handkerchief. The man\r\nthe far side of the machine starts to run. Lundie down the ride, or it\r\nmight have been Walen, shouts, \"What's happened?\" Mankeltow says,\r\n\"Collar that chap.\"\r\n\r\n'The second man runs ring-a-ring-o'-roses round the machine, one hand\r\nreachin' behind him. Mankeltow heads him off to me. He breaks blind for\r\nWalen and Lundie, who are runnin' up the ride. There's some sort of\r\nmix-up among 'em, which it's too dark to see, and a thud. Walen says,\r\n\"Oh, well collared!\" Lundie says, \"That's the only thing I never learned\r\nat Harrow!\"... Mankeltow runs up to 'em, still rubbin' his neck, and\r\nsays, \"_He_ didn't fire at me. It was the other chap. Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n'\"I've stretched him alongside his machine,\" I says.\r\n\r\n'\"Are they poachers?\" says Lundie.\r\n\r\n'\"No. Airmen. I can't make it out,\" says Mankeltow.\r\n\r\n'\"Look at here,\" says Walen, kind of brusque. \"This man ain't breathin'\r\nat all. Didn't you hear somethin' crack when he lit, Lundie?\"\r\n\r\n'\"My God!\" says Lundie. \"Did I? I thought it was my suspenders\"--no, he\r\nsaid \"braces.\"\r\n\r\n'Right there I left them and sort o' tiptoed back to my man, hopin' he'd\r\nrevived and quit. But he hadn't. That darned cleek had hit him on the\r\nback of the neck just where his helmet stopped. He'd got _his_. I knew\r\nit by the way the head rolled in my hands. Then the others came up the\r\nride totin' _their_ load. No mistakin' that shuffle on grass. D'you\r\nremember it--in South Africa? Ya-as.\r\n\r\n'\"Hsh!\" says Lundie. \"Do you know I've broken this man's neck?\"\r\n\r\n'\"Same here,\" I says.\r\n\r\n'\"What? Both?\" says Mankeltow.\r\n\r\n'\"Nonsense!\" says Lord Lundie. \"Who'd have thought he was that out of\r\ntraining? A man oughtn't to fly if he ain't fit.\"\r\n\r\n'\"What did they want here, anyway?\" said Walen; and Mankeltow says, \"We\r\ncan't leave them in the open. Some one'll come. Carry 'em to\r\nFlora's Temple.\"\r\n\r\nWe toted 'em again and laid 'em out on a stone bench. They were still\r\ndead in spite of our best attentions. We knew it, but we went through\r\nthe motions till it was quite dark. 'Wonder if all murderers do that?\r\n\"We want a light on this,\" says Walen after a spell. \"There ought to be\r\none in the machine. Why didn't they light it?\"\r\n\r\n'We came out of Flora's Temple, and shut the doors behind us. Some\r\nstars were showing then--same as when Cain did his little act, I guess.\r\nI climbed up and searched the machine. She was very well equipped, I\r\nfound two electric torches in clips alongside her barometers by the\r\nrear seat.\r\n\r\n'\"What make is she?\" says Mankeltow.\r\n\r\n'\"Continental Renzalaer,\" I says. \"My engines and my Rush Silencer.\"\r\n\r\n'Walen whistles. \"Here--let me look,\" he says, and grabs the other\r\ntorch. She was sure well equipped. We gathered up an armful of cameras\r\nan' maps an' note-books an' an album of mounted photographs which we\r\ntook to Flora's Temple and spread on a marble-topped table (I'll show\r\nyou to-morrow) which the King of Naples had presented to grandfather\r\nMarshalton. Walen starts to go through 'em. We wanted to know why our\r\nfriends had been so prejudiced against our society.\r\n\r\n'\"Wait a minute,\" says Lord Lundie. \"Lend me a handkerchief.\"\r\n\r\n'He pulls out his own, and Walen contributes his green-and-red bandanna,\r\nand Lundie covers their faces. \"Now,\" he says, \"we'll go into the\r\nevidence.\"\r\n\r\n'There wasn't any flaw in that evidence. Walen read out their last\r\nobservations, and Mankeltow asked questions, and Lord Lundie sort o'\r\nsummarised, and I looked at the photos in the album. 'J'ever see a\r\nbird's-eye telephoto-survey of England for military purposes? It's\r\ninterestin' but indecent--like turnin' a man upside down. None of those\r\nclose-range panoramas of forts could have been taken without my\r\nRush Silencer.\r\n\r\n'\"I wish _we_ was as thorough as they are,\" says Mankeltow, when Walen\r\nstopped translatin'.\r\n\r\n'\"We've been thorough enough,\" says Lord Lundie. \"The evidence against\r\nboth accused is conclusive. Any other country would give 'em seven years\r\nin a fortress. We should probably give 'em eighteen months as\r\nfirst-class misdemeanants. But their case,\" he says, \"is out of our\r\nhands. We must review our own. Mr. Zigler,\" he said, \"will you tell us\r\nwhat steps you took to bring about the death of the first accused?\" I\r\ntold him. He wanted to know specially whether I'd stretched first\r\naccused before or after he had fired at Mankeltow. Mankeltow testified\r\nhe'd been shot at, and exhibited his neck as evidence. It was scorched.\r\n\r\n'\"Now, Mr. Walen,\" says Lord Lundie. \"Will you kindly tell us what steps\r\nyou took with regard to the second accused?\"\r\n\r\n'\"The man ran directly at me, me lord,\" says Walen. \"I said, 'Oh no, you\r\ndon't,' and hit him in the face.\"\r\n\r\n'Lord Lundie lifts one hand and uncovers second accused's face. There\r\nwas a bruise on one cheek and the chin was all greened with grass. He\r\nwas a heavy-built man.\r\n\r\n'\"What happened after that?\" says Lord Lundie.\r\n\r\n'\"To the best of my remembrance he turned from me towards your\r\nlordship.\"\r\n\r\n'Then Lundie goes ahead. \"I stooped, and caught the man round the\r\nankles,\" he says. \"The sudden check threw him partially over my left\r\nshoulder. I jerked him off that shoulder, still holding his ankles, and\r\nhe fell heavily on, it would appear, the point of his chin, death being\r\ninstantaneous.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Death being instantaneous,\" says Walen.\r\n\r\n'Lord Lundie takes off his gown and wig--you could see him do it--and\r\nbecomes our fellow-murderer. \"That's our case,\" he says. \"I know how _I_\r\nshould direct the jury, but it's an undignified business for a Lord of\r\nAppeal to lift his hand to, and some of my learned brothers,\" he says,\r\n\"might be disposed to be facetious.\"\r\n\r\n'I guess I can't be properly sensitised. Any one who steered me out of\r\nthat trouble might have had the laugh on me for generations. But I'm\r\nonly a millionaire. I said we'd better search second accused in case\r\nhe'd been carryin' concealed weapons.\r\n\r\n'\"That certainly is a point,\" says Lord Lundie. \"But the question for\r\nthe jury would be whether I exercised more force than was necessary to\r\nprevent him from usin' them.\" _I_ didn't say anything. He wasn't talkin'\r\nmy language. Second accused had his gun on him sure enough, but it had\r\njammed in his hip-pocket. He was too fleshy to reach behind for business\r\npurposes, and he didn't look a gun-man anyway. Both of 'em carried wads\r\nof private letters. By the time Walen had translated, we knew how many\r\nchildren the fat one had at home and when the thin one reckoned to be\r\nmarried. Too bad! Ya-as.\r\n\r\n'Says Walen to me while we was rebuttonin' their jackets (they was not\r\nin uniform): \"Ever read a book called _The Wreckers_, Mr. Zigler?\"\r\n\r\n'\"Not that I recall at the present moment,\" I says.\r\n\r\n'\"Well, do,\" he says. \"You'd appreciate it. You'd appreciate it now, I\r\nassure you.\"\r\n\r\n'\"I'll remember,\" I says. \"But I don't see how this song and dance helps\r\nus any. Here's our corpses, here's their machine, and daylight's\r\nbound to come.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Heavens! That reminds me,\" says Lundie. \"What time's dinner?\"\r\n\r\n'\"Half-past eight,\" says Mankeltow. \"It's half-past five now. We knocked\r\noff golf at twenty to, and if they hadn't been such silly asses, firin'\r\npistols like civilians, we'd have had them to dinner. Why, they might be\r\nsitting with us in the smoking-room this very minute,\" he says. Then he\r\nsaid that no man had a right to take his profession so seriously as\r\nthese two mountebanks.\r\n\r\n'\"How interestin'!\" says Lundie. \"I've noticed this impatient attitude\r\ntoward their victim in a good many murderers. I never understood it\r\nbefore. Of course, it's the disposal of the body that annoys 'em. Now, I\r\nwonder,\" he says, \"who our case will come up before? Let's run through\r\nit again.\"\r\n\r\n'Then Walen whirls in. He'd been bitin' his nails in a corner. We was\r\nall nerved up by now.... Me? The worst of the bunch. I had to think for\r\nTommy as well.\r\n\r\n'\"We _can't_ be tried,\" says Walen. \"We _mustn't_ be tried! It'll make\r\nan infernal international stink. What did I tell you in the smoking-room\r\nafter lunch? The tension's at breaking-point already. This 'ud snap it.\r\nCan't you see that?\"\r\n\r\n'\"I was thinking of the legal aspect of the case,\" says Lundie. \"With a\r\ngood jury we'd likely be acquitted.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Acquitted!\" says Walen. \"Who'd dare acquit us in the face of what 'ud\r\nbe demanded by--the other party? Did you ever hear of the War of\r\nJenkins' ear? 'Ever hear of Mason and Slidel? 'Ever hear of an\r\nultimatum? You know who _these_ two idiots are; you know who _we_ are--a\r\nLord of Appeal, a Viscount of the English peerage, and me--_me_ knowing\r\nall I know, which the men who know dam' well know that I _do_ know! It's\r\nour necks or Armageddon. Which do you think this Government would\r\nchoose? We _can't_ be tried!\" he says.\r\n\r\n'\"Then I expect I'll have to resign me club,\" Lundie goes on. \"I don't\r\nthink that's ever been done before by an _ex-officio_ member. I must ask\r\nthe secretary.\" I guess he was kinder bunkered for the minute, or maybe\r\n'twas the lordship comin' out on him.\r\n\r\n'\"Rot!\" says Mankeltow. \"Walen's right. We can't afford to be tried.\r\nWe'll have to bury them; but my head-gardener locks up all the tools at\r\nfive o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Not on your life!\" says Lundie. He was on deck again--as the\r\nhigh-class lawyer. \"Right or wrong, if we attempt concealment of the\r\nbodies we're done for.\"\r\n\r\n\"'I'm glad of that,\" says Mankeltow, \"because, after all, it ain't\r\ncricket to bury 'em.\"\r\n\r\n'Somehow--but I know I ain't English--that consideration didn't worry\r\nme as it ought. An' besides, I was thinkin'--I had to--an' I'd begun to\r\nsee a light 'way off--a little glimmerin' light o' salvation.\r\n\r\n'\"Then what _are_ we to do?\" says Walen. \"Zigler, what do you advise?\r\nYour neck's in it too.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Gentlemen,\" I says, \"something Lord Lundie let fall a while back gives\r\nme an idea. I move that this committee empowers Big Claus and Little\r\nClaus, who have elected to commit suicide in our midst, to leave the\r\npremises _as_ they came. I'm asking you to take big chances,\" I says,\r\n\"but they're all we've got,\" and then I broke for the bi-plane.\r\n\r\n'Don't tell me the English can't think as quick as the next man when\r\nit's up to them! They lifted 'em out o' Flora's Temple--reverent, but\r\nnot wastin' time--whilst I found out what had brought her down. One\r\ncylinder was misfirin'. I didn't stop to fix it. My Renzalaer will hold\r\nup on six. We've proved that. If her crew had relied on my guarantees,\r\nthey'd have been half-way home by then, instead of takin' their seats\r\nwith hangin' heads like they was ashamed. They ought to have been\r\nashamed too, playin' gun-men in a British peer's park! I took big\r\nchances startin' her without controls, but 'twas a dead still night an'\r\na clear run--you saw it--across the Theatre into the park, and I prayed\r\nshe'd rise before she hit high timber. I set her all I dared for a quick\r\nlift. I told Mankeltow that if I gave her too much nose she'd be liable\r\nto up-end and flop. He didn't want another inquest on his estate. No,\r\nsir! So I had to fix her up in the dark. Ya-as!\r\n\r\n'I took big chances, too, while those other three held on to her and I\r\nworked her up to full power. My Renzalaer's no ventilation-fan to pull\r\nagainst. But I climbed out just in time. I'd hitched the signallin' lamp\r\nto her tail so's we could track her. Otherwise, with my Rush Silencer,\r\nwe might's well have shooed an owl out of a barn. She left just that way\r\nwhen we let her go. No sound except the propellers--_Whoo-oo-oo!\r\nWhoo-oo-oo!_ There was a dip in the ground ahead. It hid her lamp for a\r\nsecond--but there's no such thing as time in real life. Then that lamp\r\ntravelled up the far slope slow--too slow. Then it kinder lifted, we\r\njudged. Then it sure was liftin'. Then it lifted good. D'you know why?\r\nOur four naked perspirin' souls was out there underneath her, hikin' her\r\nheavens high. Yes, sir. _We_ did it!... And that lamp kept liftin' and\r\nliftin'. Then she side-slipped! My God, she side-slipped twice, which\r\nwas what I'd been afraid of all along! Then she straightened up, and\r\nwent away climbin' to glory, for that blessed star of our hope got\r\nsmaller and smaller till we couldn't track it any more. Then we\r\nbreathed. We hadn't breathed any since their arrival, but we didn't know\r\nit till we breathed that time--all together. Then we dug our\r\nfinger-nails out of our palms an' came alive again--in instalments.\r\n\r\n'Lundie spoke first. \"We therefore commit their bodies to the air,\" he\r\nsays, an' puts his cap on.\r\n\r\n'\"The deep--the deep,\" says Walen. \"It's just twenty-three miles to the\r\nChannel.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Poor chaps! Poor chaps!\" says Mankeltow. \"We'd have had 'em to dinner\r\nif they hadn't lost their heads. I can't tell you how this distresses\r\nme, Laughton.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Well, look at here, Arthur,\" I says. \"It's only God's Own Mercy you\r\nan' me ain't lyin' in Flora's Temple now, and if that fat man had known\r\nenough to fetch his gun around while he was runnin', Lord Lundie and\r\nWalen would have been alongside us.\"\r\n\r\n'\"I see that,\" he says. \"But we're alive and they're dead, don't ye\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n'\"I know it,\" I says. \"That's where the dead are always so damned unfair\r\non the survivors.\"\r\n\r\n'\"I see that too,\" he says. \"But I'd have given a good deal if it hadn't\r\nhappened, poor chaps!\"\r\n\r\n'\"Amen!\" says Lundie. Then? Oh, then we sorter walked back two an' two\r\nto Flora's Temple an' lit matches to see we hadn't left anything behind.\r\nWalen, he had confiscated the note-books before they left. There was the\r\nfirst man's pistol which we'd forgot to return him, lyin' on the stone\r\nbench. Mankeltow puts his hand on it--he never touched the trigger--an',\r\nbein' an automatic, of course the blame thing jarred off--spiteful as\r\na rattler!\r\n\r\n'\"Look out! They'll have one of us yet,\" says Walen in the dark. But\r\nthey didn't--the Lord hadn't quit being our shepherd--and we heard the\r\nbullet zip across the veldt--quite like old times. Ya-as!\r\n\r\n'\"Swine!\" says Mankeltow.\r\n\r\n'After that I didn't hear any more \"Poor chap\" talk.... Me? I never\r\nworried about killing _my_ man. I was too busy figurin' how a British\r\njury might regard the proposition. I guess Lundie felt that way too.\r\n\r\n'Oh, but say! We had an interestin' time at dinner. Folks was expected\r\nwhose auto had hung up on the road. They hadn't wired, and Peters had\r\nlaid two extra places. We noticed 'em as soon as we sat down. I'd hate\r\nto say how noticeable they were. Mankeltow with his neck bandaged (he'd\r\ncaught a relaxed throat golfin') sent for Peters and told him to take\r\nthose empty places away--_if you please_. It takes something to rattle\r\nPeters. He was rattled that time. Nobody else noticed anything.\r\nAnd now...'\r\n\r\n'Where did they come down?' I asked, as he rose.\r\n\r\n'In the Channel, I guess. There was nothing in the papers about 'em.\r\nShall we go into the drawin'-room, and see what these boys and girls are\r\ndoin?' But say, ain't life in England inter_es_tin'?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     REBIRTH\r\n\r\n       If any God should say\r\n         \"I will restore\r\n       The world her yesterday\r\n         Whole as before\r\n     My Judgment blasted it\"--who would not lift\r\n     Heart, eye, and hand in passion o'er the gift?\r\n\r\n       If any God should will\r\n         To wipe from mind\r\n       The memory of this ill\r\n         Which is mankind\r\n     In soul and substance now--who would not bless\r\n     Even to tears His loving-tenderness?\r\n\r\n       If any God should give\r\n         Us leave to fly\r\n       These present deaths we live,\r\n         And safely die\r\n     In those lost lives we lived ere we were born--\r\n     What man but would not laugh the excuse to scorn?\r\n\r\n       For we are what we are--\r\n         So broke to blood\r\n       And the strict works of war--\r\n         So long subdued\r\n     To sacrifice, that threadbare Death commands\r\n     Hardly observance at our busier hands.\r\n\r\n       Yet we were what we were,\r\n         And, fashioned so,\r\n       It pleases us to stare\r\n         At the far show\r\n     Of unbelievable years and shapes that flit,\r\n     In our own likeness, on the edge of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Horse Marines\r\n\r\n(1911)\r\n\r\n_The Rt. Hon. R.B. Haldane, Secretary of State for War[6], was\r\nquestioned in the House of Commons on April 8th about the rocking-horses\r\nwhich the War Office is using for the purpose of teaching recruits to\r\nride. Lord Ronaldshay asked the War Secretary if rocking-horses were to\r\nbe supplied to all the cavalry regiments for teaching recruits to ride.\r\n'The noble Lord,' replied Mr. Haldane, 'is doubtless alluding to certain\r\ndummy horses on rockers which have been tested with very satisfactory\r\nresults.'... The mechanical steed is a wooden horse with an astonishing\r\ntail. It is painted brown and mounted on swinging rails. The recruit\r\nleaps into the saddle and pulls at the reins while the riding-instructor\r\nrocks the animal to and fro with his foot. The rocking-horses are being\r\nmade at Woolwich. They are quite cheap_.\r\n\r\n--Daily Paper.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Now Viscount Haldane of Cloan.]\r\n\r\nMy instructions to Mr. Leggatt, my engineer, had been accurately obeyed.\r\nHe was to bring my car on completion of annual overhaul, from Coventry\r\n_via_ London, to Southampton Docks to await my arrival; and very pretty\r\nshe looked, under the steamer's side among the railway lines, at six in\r\nthe morning. Next to her new paint and varnish I was most impressed by\r\nher four brand-new tyres.\r\n\r\n'But I didn't order new tyres,' I said as we moved away. 'These are\r\nIrresilients, too.'\r\n\r\n'Treble-ribbed,' said Leggatt. 'Diamond-stud sheathing.'\r\n\r\n'Then there has been a mistake.'\r\n\r\n'Oh no, sir; they're gratis.'\r\n\r\nThe number of motor manufacturers who give away complete sets of\r\ntreble-ribbed Irresilient tyres is so limited that I believe I asked\r\nLeggatt for an explanation.\r\n\r\n'I don't know that I could very well explain, sir,' was the answer. 'It\r\n'ud come better from Mr. Pyecroft. He's on leaf at Portsmouth--staying\r\nwith his uncle. His uncle 'ad the body all night. I'd defy you to find a\r\nscratch on her even with a microscope.'\r\n\r\n'Then we will go home by the Portsmouth road,' I said.\r\n\r\nAnd we went at those speeds which are allowed before the working-day\r\nbegins or the police are thawed out. We were blocked near Portsmouth by\r\na battalion of Regulars on the move.\r\n\r\n'Whitsuntide manoeuvres just ending,' said Leggatt. 'They've had a\r\nfortnight in the Downs.'\r\n\r\nHe said no more until we were in a narrow street somewhere behind\r\nPortsmouth Town Railway Station, where he slowed at a green-grocery\r\nshop. The door was open, and a small old man sat on three potato-baskets\r\nswinging his feet over a stooping blue back.\r\n\r\n'You call that shinin' 'em?' he piped. 'Can you see your face in 'em\r\nyet? No! Then shine 'em, or I'll give you a beltin' you'll remember!'\r\n\r\n'If you stop kickin' me in the mouth perhaps I'd do better,' said\r\nPyecroft's voice meekly.\r\n\r\nWe blew the horn.\r\n\r\nPyecroft arose, put away the brushes, and received us not otherwise than\r\nas a king in his own country.\r\n\r\n'Are you going to leave me up here all day?' said the old man.\r\n\r\nPyecroft lifted him down and he hobbled into the back room.\r\n\r\n'It's his corns,' Pyecroft explained. 'You can't shine corny feet--and\r\nhe hasn't had his breakfast.'\r\n\r\n'I haven't had mine either,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Breakfast for two more, uncle,' Pyecroft sang out.\r\n\r\n'Go out an' buy it then,' was the answer, 'or else it's half-rations.'\r\n\r\nPyecroft turned to Leggatt, gave him his marketing orders, and\r\ndespatched him with the coppers.\r\n\r\n'I have got four new tyres on my car,' I began impressively.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Mr. Pyecroft. 'You have, and I _will_ say'--he patted my\r\ncar's bonnet--'you earned 'em.'\r\n\r\n'I want to know why--,' I went on.\r\n\r\n'Quite justifiable. You haven't noticed anything in the papers, have\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'I've only just landed. I haven't seen a paper for weeks.'\r\n\r\n'Then you can lend me a virgin ear. There's been a scandal in the\r\nJunior Service--the Army, I believe they call 'em.'\r\n\r\nA bag of coffee-beans pitched on the counter. 'Roast that,' said the\r\nuncle from within.\r\n\r\nPyecroft rigged a small coffee-roaster, while I took down the shutters,\r\nand sold a young lady in curl-papers two bunches of mixed greens and one\r\nsoft orange.\r\n\r\n'Sickly stuff to handle on an empty stomach, ain't it?' said Pyecroft.\r\n\r\n'What about my new tyres?' I insisted.\r\n\r\n'Oh, any amount. But the question is'--he looked at me steadily--'is\r\nthis what you might call a court-martial or a post-mortem inquiry?'\r\n\r\n'Strictly a post-mortem,' said I.\r\n\r\n'That being so,' said Pyecroft, 'we can rapidly arrive at facts. Last\r\nThursday--the shutters go behind those baskets--last Thursday at five\r\nbells in the forenoon watch, otherwise ten-thirty A.M., your Mr. Leggatt\r\nwas discovered on Westminster Bridge laying his course for the Old\r\nKent Road.'\r\n\r\n'But that doesn't lead to Southampton,' I interrupted.\r\n\r\n'Then perhaps he was swinging the car for compasses. Be that as it may,\r\nwe found him in that latitude, simultaneous as Jules and me was _ong\r\nroute_ for Waterloo to rejoin our respective ships--or Navies I should\r\nsay. Jules was a _permissionaire_, which meant being on leaf, same as\r\nme, from a French cassowary-cruiser at Portsmouth. A party of her trusty\r\nand well-beloved petty officers 'ad been seeing London, chaperoned by\r\nthe R.C. Chaplain. Jules 'ad detached himself from the squadron and was\r\ncruisin' on his own when I joined him, in company of copious\r\nlady-friends. _But_, mark you, your Mr. Leggatt drew the line at the\r\ngirls. Loud and long he drew it.'\r\n\r\n'I'm glad of that,' I said.\r\n\r\n'You may be. He adopted the puristical formation from the first. \"Yes,\"\r\nhe said, when we was annealing him at--but you wouldn't know the pub--\"I\r\n_am_ going to Southampton,\" he says, \"and I'll stretch a point to go\r\n_via_ Portsmouth; _but_,\" says he, \"seeing what sort of one hell of a\r\ntime invariably trarnspires when we cruise together, Mr. Pyecroft, I do\r\n_not_ feel myself justified towards my generous and long-suffering\r\nemployer in takin' on that kind of ballast as well.\" I assure you he\r\nconsidered your interests.'\r\n\r\n'And the girls?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I left that to Jules. I'm a monogomite by nature. So we embarked\r\nstrictly _ong garçong_. But I should tell you, in case he didn't, that\r\nyour Mr. Leggatt's care for your interests 'ad extended to sheathing the\r\ncar in matting and gunny-bags to preserve her paint-work. She was all\r\nswathed up like an I-talian baby.'\r\n\r\n'He _is_ careful about his paint-work,' I said.\r\n\r\n'For a man with no Service experience I should say he was fair homicidal\r\non the subject. If we'd been Marines he couldn't have been more pointed\r\nin his allusions to our hob-nailed socks. However, we reduced him to a\r\nmalleable condition, and embarked for Portsmouth. I'd seldom rejoined\r\nmy _vaisseau ong automobile, avec_ a fur coat and goggles. Nor\r\n'ad Jules.'\r\n\r\n'Did Jules say much?' I asked, helplessly turning the handle of the\r\ncoffee-roaster.\r\n\r\n'That's where I pitied the pore beggar. He 'adn't the language, so to\r\nspeak. He was confined to heavings and shruggin's and copious _Mong\r\nJews_! The French are very badly fitted with relief-valves. And then our\r\nMr. Leggatt drove. He drove.'\r\n\r\n'Was he in a very malleable condition?'\r\n\r\n'Not him! We recognised the value of his cargo from the outset. He\r\nhadn't a chance to get more than moist at the edges. After which we went\r\nto sleep; and now we'll go to breakfast.'\r\n\r\nWe entered the back room where everything was in order, and a screeching\r\ncanary made us welcome. The uncle had added sausages and piles of\r\nbuttered toast to the kippers. The coffee, cleared with a piece of\r\nfish-skin, was a revelation.\r\n\r\nLeggatt, who seemed to know the premises, had run the car into the tiny\r\nbackyard where her mirror-like back almost blocked up the windows. He\r\nminded shop while we ate. Pyecroft passed him his rations through a flap\r\nin the door. The uncle ordered him in, after breakfast, to wash up, and\r\nhe jumped in his gaiters at the old man's commands as he has never\r\njumped to mine.\r\n\r\n'To resoom the post-mortem,' said Pyecroft, lighting his pipe. 'My\r\nslumbers were broken by the propeller ceasing to revolve, and by vile\r\nlanguage from your Mr. Leggatt.'\r\n\r\n'I--I--' Leggatt began, a blue-checked duster in one hand and a cup in\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n'When you're wanted aft you'll be sent for, Mr. Leggatt,' said Pyecroft\r\namiably. 'It's clean mess decks for you now. Resooming once more, we was\r\non a lonely and desolate ocean near Portsdown, surrounded by gorse\r\nbushes, and a Boy Scout was stirring my stomach with his little\r\ncopper-stick.'\r\n\r\n'\"You count ten,\" he says.\r\n\r\n'\"Very good, Boy Jones,\" I says, \"count 'em,\" and I hauled him in over\r\nthe gunnel, and ten I gave him with my large flat hand. The remarks he\r\npassed, lying face down tryin' to bite my leg, would have reflected\r\ncredit on any Service. Having finished I dropped him overboard again,\r\nwhich was my gross political error. I ought to 'ave killed him; because\r\nhe began signalling--rapid and accurate--in a sou'westerly direction.\r\nFew equatorial calms are to be apprehended when B.P.'s little pets take\r\nto signallin'. Make a note o' that! Three minutes later we were stopped\r\nand boarded by Scouts--up our backs, down our necks, and in our boots!\r\nThe last I heard from your Mr. Leggatt as he went under, brushin' 'em\r\noff his cap, was thanking Heaven he'd covered up the new paint-work with\r\nmats. An 'eroic soul!'\r\n\r\n'Not a scratch on her body,' said Leggatt, pouring out the\r\ncoffee-grounds.\r\n\r\n'And Jules?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Jules thought the much advertised Social Revolution had begun, but\r\nhis mackintosh hampered him.\r\n\r\n'You told me to bring the mackintosh,' Leggatt whispered to me.\r\n\r\n'And when I 'ad 'em half convinced he was a French vicomte coming down\r\nto visit the Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth, he tried to take it off.\r\nSeeing his uniform underneath, some sucking Sherlock Holmes of the Pink\r\nEye Patrol (they called him Eddy) deduced that I wasn't speaking\r\nthe truth. Eddy said I was tryin' to sneak into Portsmouth\r\nunobserved--unobserved mark you!--and join hands with the enemy. It\r\ntrarnspired that the Scouts was conducting a field-day against opposin'\r\nforces, ably assisted by all branches of the Service, and they was so\r\nafraid the car wouldn't count ten points to them in the fray, that\r\nthey'd have scalped us, but for the intervention of an umpire--also in\r\nshort under-drawers. A fleshy sight!'\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Pyecroft shut his eyes and nodded. 'That umpire,' he said\r\nsuddenly, 'was our Mr. Morshed--a gentleman whose acquaintance you have\r\nalready made _and_ profited by, if I mistake not[7].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: 'Their Lawful Occasions,' _Traffics and Discoveries_.]\r\n\r\n'Oh, was the Navy in it too?' I said; for I had read of wild doings\r\noccasionally among the Boy Scouts on the Portsmouth Road, in which Navy,\r\nArmy, and the world at large seemed to have taken part.\r\n\r\n'The Navy _was_ in it. I was the only one out of it--for several\r\nseconds. Our Mr. Morshed failed to recognise me in my fur boa, and my\r\nappealin' winks at 'im behind your goggles didn't arrive. But when Eddy\r\ndarling had told his story, I saluted, which is difficult in furs, and I\r\nstated I was bringin' him dispatches from the North. My Mr. Morshed\r\ncohered on the instant. I've never known his ethergram installations out\r\nof order yet. \"Go and guard your blessed road,\" he says to the Fratton\r\nOrphan Asylum standing at attention all round him, and, when they was\r\nremoved--\"Pyecroft,\" he says, still _sotte voce_, \"what in Hong-Kong are\r\nyou doing with this dun-coloured _sampan_?\"\r\n\r\n'It was your Mr. Leggatt's paint-protective matting which caught his\r\neye. She _did_ resemble a _sampan_, especially about the stern-works. At\r\nthese remarks I naturally threw myself on 'is bosom, so far as Service\r\nconditions permitted, and revealed him all, mentioning that the car was\r\nyours. You know his way of working his lips like a rabbit? Yes, he was\r\nquite pleased. \"_His_ car!\" he kept murmuring, working his lips like a\r\nrabbit. \"I owe 'im more than a trifle for things he wrote about me. I'll\r\nkeep the car.\"\r\n\r\n'Your Mr. Leggatt now injected some semi-mutinous remarks to the effect\r\nthat he was your chauffeur in charge of your car, and, as such, capable\r\nof so acting. Mr. Morshed threw him a glarnce. It sufficed. Didn't it\r\nsuffice, Mr. Leggatt?'\r\n\r\n'I knew if something didn't happen, something worse would,' said\r\nLeggatt. 'It never fails when you're aboard.'\r\n\r\n'And Jules?' I demanded.\r\n\r\n'Jules was, so to speak, panicking in a water-tight flat through his\r\nunfortunate lack of language. I had to introduce him as part of the\r\n_entente cordiale_, and he was put under arrest, too. Then we sat on the\r\ngrass and smoked, while Eddy and Co. violently annoyed the traffic on\r\nthe Portsmouth Road, till the umpires, all in short panties, conferred\r\non the valuable lessons of the field-day and added up points, same as at\r\ntarget-practice. I didn't hear their conclusions, but our Mr. Morshed\r\ndelivered a farewell address to Eddy and Co., tellin' 'em they ought to\r\nhave deduced from a hundred signs about me, that I was a friendly\r\nbringin' in dispatches from the North. We left 'em tryin' to find those\r\nsigns in the Scout book, and we reached Mr. Morshed's hotel at\r\nPortsmouth at 6.27 P.M. _ong automobile_. Here endeth the\r\nfirst chapter.'\r\n\r\n'Begin the second,' I said.\r\n\r\nThe uncle and Leggatt had finished washing up and were seated, smoking,\r\nwhile the damp duster dried at the fire.\r\n\r\n'About what time was it,' said Pyecroft to Leggatt, 'when our Mr.\r\nMorshed began to talk about uncles?'\r\n\r\n'When he came back to the bar, after he'd changed into those rat-catcher\r\nclothes,' said Leggatt.\r\n\r\n'That's right. \"Pye,\" said he, \"have you an uncle?\" \"I have,\" I says.\r\n\"Here's santy to him,\" and I finished my sherry and bitters to\r\n_you_, uncle.'\r\n\r\n'That's right,' said Pyecroft's uncle sternly. 'If you hadn't I'd have\r\nbelted you worth rememberin', Emmanuel. I had the body all night.'\r\n\r\nPyecroft smiled affectionately. 'So you 'ad, uncle, an' beautifully you\r\nlooked after her. But as I was saying, \"I have an uncle, too,\" says Mr.\r\nMorshed, dark and lowering. \"Yet somehow I can't love him. I want to\r\nmortify the beggar. Volunteers to mortify my uncle, one pace to\r\nthe front.\"\r\n\r\n'I took Jules with me the regulation distance. Jules was getting\r\ninterested. Your Mr. Leggatt preserved a strictly nootral attitude.\r\n\r\n'\"You're a pressed man,\" says our Mr. Morshed. \"I owe your late employer\r\nmuch, so to say. The car will manoeuvre all night, as requisite.\"\r\n\r\n'Mr. Leggatt come out noble as your employee, and, by 'Eaven's divine\r\ngrace, instead of arguing, he pleaded his new paint and varnish which\r\nwas Mr. Morshed's one vital spot (he's lootenant on one of the new\r\ncatch-'em-alive-o's now). \"True,\" says he, \"paint's an 'oly thing. I'll\r\ngive you one hour to arrange a _modus vivendi_. Full bunkers and steam\r\nready by 9 P.M. to-night, _if_ you please.\"\r\n\r\n'Even so, Mr. Leggatt was far from content. _I_ 'ad to arrange the\r\ndetails. We run her into the yard here.' Pyecroft nodded through the\r\nwindow at my car's glossy back-panels. 'We took off the body with its\r\nmats and put it in the stable, substitooting (and that yard's a tight\r\nfit for extensive repairs) the body of uncle's blue delivery cart. It\r\noverhung a trifle, but after I'd lashed it I knew it wouldn't fetch\r\nloose. Thus, in our composite cruiser, we repaired once more to the\r\nhotel, and was immediately dispatched to the toy-shop in the High Street\r\nwhere we took aboard one rocking-horse which was waiting for us.'\r\n\r\n'Took aboard _what_?' I cried.\r\n\r\n'One fourteen-hand dapple-grey rocking-horse, with pure green rockers\r\nand detachable tail, pair gashly glass eyes, complete set 'orrible\r\ngrinnin' teeth, and two bloody-red nostrils which, protruding from the\r\nbrown papers, produced the _tout ensemble_ of a Ju-ju sacrifice in the\r\nBenin campaign. Do I make myself comprehensible?'\r\n\r\n'Perfectly. Did you say anything?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Only to Jules. To him, I says, wishing to try him. \"_Allez à votre\r\nbateau. Je say mon Lootenong. Eel voo donneray porkwor_.\" To me, says\r\nhe, \"_Vous ong ate hurroo! Jamay de la vee_!\" and I saw by his eye he'd\r\ntaken on for the full term of the war. Jules was a blue-eyed,\r\nbrindle-haired beggar of a useful make and inquirin' habits. Your Mr.\r\nLeggatt he only groaned.'\r\n\r\nLeggatt nodded. 'It was like nightmares,' he said. 'It was like\r\nnightmares.'\r\n\r\n'Once more, then,' Pyecroft swept on, 'we returned to the hotel and\r\npartook of a sumptuous repast, under the able and genial chairmanship of\r\nour Mr. Morshed, who laid his projecks unreservedly before us. \"In the\r\nfirst place,\" he says, opening out bicycle-maps, \"my uncle, who, I\r\nregret to say, is a brigadier-general, has sold his alleged soul to\r\nDicky Bridoon for a feathery hat and a pair o' gilt spurs. Jules,\r\n_conspuez l'oncle_!\" So Jules, you'll be glad to hear--'\r\n\r\n'One minute, Pye,' I said. 'Who is Dicky Bridoon?'\r\n\r\n'I don't usually mingle myself up with the bickerings of the Junior\r\nService, but it trarnspired that he was Secretary o' State for Civil\r\nWar, an' he'd been issuing mechanical leather-belly gee-gees which\r\ndoctors recommend for tumour--to the British cavalry in loo of real meat\r\nhorses, to learn to ride on. Don't you remember there was quite a stir\r\nin the papers owing to the cavalry not appreciatin' 'em? But that's a\r\nminor item. The main point was that our uncle, in his capacity of\r\nbrigadier-general, mark you, had wrote to the papers highly approvin' o'\r\nDicky Bridoon's mechanical substitutes an 'ad thus obtained\r\npromotion--all same as a agnosticle stoker psalm-singin' 'imself up the\r\nService under a pious captain. At that point of the narrative we caught\r\na phosphorescent glimmer why the rocking-horse might have been issued;\r\nbut none the less the navigation was intricate. Omitting the fact it was\r\ndark and cloudy, our brigadier-uncle lay somewhere in the South Downs\r\nwith his brigade, which was manoeuvrin' at Whitsum manoeuvres on a large\r\nscale--Red Army _versus_ Blue, et cetera; an' all we 'ad to go by was\r\nthose flapping bicycle-maps and your Mr. Leggatt's groans.'\r\n\r\n'I was thinking what the Downs mean after dark,' said Leggatt angrily.\r\n\r\n'They was worth thinkin' of,' said Pyecroft. 'When we had studied the\r\nmap till it fair spun, we decided to sally forth and creep for uncle by\r\nhand in the dark, dark night, an' present 'im with the rocking-horse. So\r\nwe embarked at 8.57 P.M.'\r\n\r\n'One minute again, please. How much did Jules understand by that time?'\r\nI asked.\r\n\r\n'Sufficient unto the day--or night, perhaps I should say. He told our\r\nMr. Morshed he'd follow him _more sang frays_, which is French for dead,\r\ndrunk, or damned. Barrin' 'is paucity o' language, there wasn't a\r\nblemish on Jules. But what I wished to imply was, when we climbed into\r\nthe back parts of the car, our Lootenant Morshed says to me, \"I doubt if\r\nI'd flick my cigar-ends about too lavish, Mr. Pyecroft. We ought to be\r\nsitting on five pounds' worth of selected fireworks, and I think the\r\nrockets are your end.\" Not being able to smoke with my 'ead over the\r\nside I threw it away; and then your Mr. Leggatt, 'aving been as nearly\r\nmutinous as it pays to be with my Mr. Morshed, arched his back\r\nand drove.'\r\n\r\n'Where did he drive to, please?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Primerrily, in search of any or either or both armies; seconderrily, of\r\ncourse, in search of our brigadier-uncle. Not finding him on the road,\r\nwe ran about the grass looking for him. This took us to a great many\r\nplaces in a short time. Ow 'eavenly that lilac did smell on top of that\r\nfirst Down--stinkin' its blossomin' little heart out!'\r\n\r\n'I 'adn't leesure to notice,' said Mr. Leggatt. 'The Downs were full o'\r\nchalk-pits, and we'd no lights.'\r\n\r\n'We 'ad the bicycle-lamp to look at the map by. Didn't you notice the\r\nold lady at the window where we saw the man in the night-gown? I thought\r\nnight-gowns as sleepin' rig was extinck, so to speak.'\r\n\r\n'I tell you I 'adn't leesure to notice,' Leggatt repeated.\r\n\r\n'That's odd. Then what might 'ave made you tell the sentry at the first\r\ncamp we found that you was the _Daily Express_ delivery-waggon?'\r\n\r\n'You can't touch pitch without being defiled,' Leggatt answered. ''Oo\r\ntold the officer in the bath we were umpires?'\r\n\r\n'Well, he asked us. That was when we found the Territorial battalion\r\nundressin' in slow time. It lay on the left flank o' the Blue Army, and\r\nit cackled as it lay, too. But it gave us our position as regards the\r\nrespective armies. We wandered a little more, and at 11.7 P.M., not\r\nhaving had a road under us for twenty minutes, we scaled the heights of\r\nsomething or other--which are about six hundred feet high. Here we\r\n'alted to tighten the lashings of the superstructure, and we smelt\r\nleather and horses three counties deep all round. We was, as you might\r\nsay, in the thick of it.'\r\n\r\n'\"Ah!\" says my Mr. Morshed. \"My 'orizon has indeed broadened. What a\r\nlittle thing is an uncle, Mr. Pyecroft, in the presence o' these\r\nglitterin' constellations! Simply ludicrous!\" he says, \"to waste a\r\nrocking-horse on an individual. We must socialise it. But we must get\r\ntheir 'eads up first. Touch off one rocket, if you please.\"\r\n\r\n'I touched off a green three-pounder which rose several thousand metres,\r\nand burst into gorgeous stars. \"Reproduce the manoeuvre,\" he says, \"at\r\nthe other end o' this ridge--if it don't end in another cliff.\" So we\r\nsteamed down the ridge a mile and a half east, and then I let Jules\r\ntouch off a pink rocket, or he'd ha' kissed me. That was his only way to\r\nexpress his emotions, so to speak. Their heads come up then all around\r\nus to the extent o' thousands. We hears bugles like cocks crowing below,\r\nand on the top of it a most impressive sound which I'd never enjoyed\r\nbefore because 'itherto I'd always been an inteegral part of it, so to\r\nsay--the noise of 'ole armies gettin' under arms. They must 'ave\r\nanticipated a night attack, I imagine. Most impressive. Then we 'eard a\r\nthreshin'-machine. \"Tutt! Tutt! This is childish!\" says Lootenant\r\nMorshed. \"We can't wait till they've finished cutting chaff for their\r\nhorses. We must make 'em understand we're not to be trifled with.\r\nExpedite 'em with another rocket, Mr. Pyecroft.\"\r\n\r\n'\"It's barely possible, sir,\" I remarks, \"that that's a searchlight\r\nchurnin' up,\" and by the time we backed into a providential chalk\r\ncutting (which was where our first tyre went pungo) she broke out to the\r\nnorthward, and began searching the ridge. A smart bit o' work.'\r\n\r\n''Twasn't a puncture. The inner tube had nipped because we skidded so,'\r\nLeggatt interrupted.\r\n\r\n'While your Mr. Leggatt was effectin' repairs, another searchlight broke\r\nout to the southward, and the two of 'em swept our ridge on both sides.\r\nRight at the west end of it they showed us the ground rising into a\r\nhill, so to speak, crowned with what looked like a little fort. Morshed\r\nsaw it before the beams shut off. \"That's the key of the position!\" he\r\nsays. \"Occupy it at all hazards.\"\r\n\r\n'\"I haven't half got occupation for the next twenty minutes,\" says your\r\nMr. Leggatt, rootin' and blasphemin' in the dark. Mark, now, 'ow\r\nMorshed changed his tactics to suit 'is environment. \"Right!\" says he.\r\n\"I'll stand by the ship. Mr. Pyecroft and Jules, oblige me by doubling\r\nalong the ridge to the east with all the maroons and crackers you can\r\ncarry without spilling. Read the directions careful for the maroons, Mr.\r\nPyecroft, and touch them off at half-minute intervals. Jules represents\r\nmusketry an' maxim fire under your command. Remember, it's death or\r\nSalisbury Gaol! Prob'ly both!\"\r\n\r\n'By these means and some moderately 'ard runnin', we distracted 'em to\r\nthe eastward. Maroons, you may not be aware, are same as bombs, with the\r\nanarchism left out. In confined spots like chalk-pits, they knock a\r\nfour-point-seven silly. But you should read the directions before'and.\r\nIn the intervals of the slow but well-directed fire of my cow-guns,\r\nJules, who had found a sheep-pond in the dark a little lower down, gave\r\nwhat you might call a cinematograph reproduction o' sporadic musketry.\r\nThey was large size crackers, and he concluded with the dull, sickenin'\r\nthud o' blind shells burstin' on soft ground.'\r\n\r\n'How did he manage that?' I said.\r\n\r\n'You throw a lighted squib into water and you'll see,' said Pyecroft.\r\n'Thus, then, we improvised till supplies was exhausted and the\r\nsurrounding landscapes fair 'owled and 'ummed at us. The Jun or Service\r\nmight 'ave 'ad their doubts about the rockets but they couldn't overlook\r\nour gunfire. Both sides tumbled out full of initiative. I told Jules no\r\ntwo flat-feet 'ad any right to be as happy as us, and we went back\r\nalong the ridge to the derelict, and there was our Mr. Morshed\r\napostrophin' his 'andiwork over fifty square mile o' country with\r\n\"Attend, all ye who list to hear!\" out of the Fifth Reader. He'd got as\r\nfar as \"And roused the shepherds o' Stonehenge, the rangers o' Beaulieu\"\r\nwhen we come up, and he drew our attention to its truth as well as its\r\nbeauty. That's rare in poetry, I'm told. He went right on to--\"The red\r\nglare on Skiddaw roused those beggars at Carlisle\"--which he pointed out\r\nwas poetic license for Leith Hill. This allowed your Mr. Leggatt time to\r\nfinish pumpin' up his tyres. I 'eard the sweat 'op off his nose.'\r\n\r\n'You know what it is, sir,' said poor Leggatt to me.\r\n\r\n'It warfted across my mind, as I listened to what was trarnspirin', that\r\nit might be easier to make the mess than to wipe it up, but such\r\nconsiderations weighed not with our valiant leader.\r\n\r\n'\"Mr. Pyecroft,\" he says, \"it can't have escaped your notice that we\r\n'ave one angry and 'ighly intelligent army in front of us, an' another\r\n'ighly angry and equally intelligent army in our rear. What 'ud you\r\nrecommend?\"\r\n\r\n'Most men would have besought 'im to do a lateral glide while there was\r\nyet time, but all I said was: \"The rocking-horse isn't expended\r\nyet, sir.\"\r\n\r\n'He laid his hand on my shoulder. \"Pye,\" says he, \"there's worse men\r\nthan you in loftier places. They shall 'ave it. None the less,\" he\r\nremarks, \"the ice is undeniably packing.\"\r\n\r\n'I may 'ave omitted to point out that at this juncture two large\r\narmies, both deprived of their night's sleep, was awake, as you might\r\nsay, and hurryin' into each other's arms. Here endeth the\r\nsecond chapter.'\r\n\r\nHe filled his pipe slowly. The uncle had fallen asleep. Leggatt lit\r\nanother cigarette.\r\n\r\n'We then proceeded _ong automobile_ along the ridge in a westerly\r\ndirection towards the miniature fort which had been so kindly revealed\r\nby the searchlight, but which on inspection (your Mr. Leggatt bumped\r\ninto an outlyin' reef of it) proved to be a wurzel-clump;\r\n_c'est-à-dire_, a parallelogrammatic pile of about three million\r\nmangold-wurzels, brought up there for the sheep, I suppose. On all\r\nsides, excep' the one we'd come by, the ground fell away moderately\r\nquick, and down at the bottom there was a large camp lit up an' full of\r\nharsh words of command.\r\n\r\n'\"I said it was the key to the position,\" Lootenant Morshed remarks.\r\n\"Trot out Persimmon!\" which we rightly took to read, \"Un-wrap the\r\nrocking-horse.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Houp la!\" says Jules in a insubordinate tone, an' slaps Persimmon on\r\nthe flank.\r\n\r\n'\"Silence!\" says the Lootenant. \"This is the Royal Navy, not Newmarket\";\r\nand we carried Persimmon to the top of the mangel-wurzel clump\r\nas directed.\r\n\r\n'Owing to the inequalities of the terrain (I _do_ think your Mr. Leggatt\r\nmight have had a spirit-level in his kit) he wouldn't rock free on the\r\nbed-plate, and while adjustin' him, his detachable tail fetched adrift.\r\nOur Lootenant was quick to seize the advantage.\r\n\r\n'\"Remove that transformation,\" he says. \"Substitute one Roman candle.\r\nGas-power is superior to manual propulsion.\"\r\n\r\n'So we substituted. He arranged the _pièce de resistarnce_ in the shape\r\nof large drums--not saucers, mark you--drums of coloured fire, with\r\nprinted instructions, at proper distances round Persimmon. There was a\r\nbrief interregnum while we dug ourselves in among the wurzels by hand.\r\nThen he touched off the fires, _not_ omitting the Roman candle, and, you\r\nmay take it from me, all was visible. Persimmon shone out in his naked\r\nsplendour, red to port, green to starboard, and one white light at his\r\nbows, as per Board o' Trade regulations. Only he didn't so much rock,\r\nyou might say, as shrug himself, in a manner of speaking, every time the\r\ncandle went off. One can't have everything. But the rest surpassed our\r\nhighest expectations. I think Persimmon was noblest on the starboard or\r\ngreen side--more like when a man thinks he's seeing mackerel in hell,\r\ndon't you know? And yet I'd be the last to deprecate the effect of the\r\nport light on his teeth, or that blood-shot look in his left eye. He\r\nknew there was something going on he didn't approve of. He\r\nlooked worried.'\r\n\r\n'Did you laugh?' I said.\r\n\r\n'I'm not much of a wag myself; nor it wasn't as if we 'ad time to allow\r\nthe spectacle to sink in. The coloured fires was supposed to burn ten\r\nminutes, whereas it was obvious to the meanest capacity that the Junior\r\nService would arrive by forced marches in about two and a half. They\r\ngrarsped our topical allusion as soon as it was across the foot-lights,\r\nso to speak. They were quite chafed at it. Of course, 'ad we reflected,\r\nwe might have known that exposin' illuminated rockin'-horses to an army\r\nthat was learnin' to ride on 'em partook of the nature of a _double\r\nentender_, as the French say--same as waggling the tiller lines at a man\r\nwho's had a hanging in the family. I knew the cox of the\r\n_Archimandrite's_ galley 'arf killed for a similar _plaisan-teree._ But\r\nwe never anticipated lobsters being so sensitive. That was why we\r\nshifted. We could 'ardly tear our commandin' officer away. He put his\r\nhead on one side, and kept cooin'. The only thing he 'ad neglected to\r\nprovide was a line of retreat; but your Mr. Leggatt--an 'eroic soul in\r\nthe last stage of wet prostration--here took command of the van, or,\r\nrather, the rear-guard. We walked downhill beside him, holding on to the\r\nsuperstructure to prevent her capsizing. These technical details,\r\n'owever, are beyond me.' He waved his pipe towards Leggatt.\r\n\r\n'I saw there was two deepish ruts leadin' down 'ill somewhere,' said\r\nLeggatt. 'That was when the soldiers stopped laughin', and begun to\r\nrun uphill.'\r\n\r\n'Stroll, lovey, stroll!' Pyecroft corrected. 'The Dervish rush took\r\nplace later.'\r\n\r\n'So I laid her in these ruts. That was where she must 'ave scraped her\r\nsilencer a bit. Then they turned sharp right--the ruts did--and then she\r\nstopped bonnet-high in a manure-heap, sir; but I'll swear it was all of\r\na one in three gradient. I think it was a barnyard. We waited there,'\r\nsaid Leggatt.\r\n\r\n'But not for long,' said Pyecroft. 'The lights were towering out of the\r\ndrums on the position we 'ad so valiantly abandoned; and the Junior\r\nService was escaladin' it _en masse_. When numerous bodies of 'ighly\r\ntrained men arrive simultaneous in the same latitude from opposite\r\ndirections, each remarking briskly, \"What the 'ell did you do _that_\r\nfor?\" detonation, as you might say, is practically assured. They didn't\r\nask for extraneous aids. If we'd come out with sworn affidavits of what\r\nwe'd done they wouldn't 'ave believed us. They wanted each other's\r\ncompany exclusive. Such was the effect of Persimmon on their clarss\r\nfeelings. Idol'try, _I_ call it! Events transpired with the utmost\r\nvelocity and rapidly increasing pressures. There was a few remarks about\r\nDicky Bridoon and mechanical horses, and then some one was smacked--hard\r\nby the sound--in the middle of a remark.'\r\n\r\n'That was the man who kept calling for the Forty-fifth Dragoons,' said\r\nLeggatt. 'He got as far as Drag ...'\r\n\r\n'Was it?' said Pyecroft dreamily. 'Well, he couldn't say they didn't\r\ncome. They all came, and they all fell to arguin' whether the Infantry\r\nshould 'ave Persimmon for a regimental pet or the Cavalry should keep\r\nhim for stud purposes. Hence the issue was soon clouded with\r\nmangold-wurzels. Our commander said we 'ad sowed the good seed, and it\r\nwas bearing abundant fruit. (They weigh between four and seven pounds\r\napiece.) Seein' the children 'ad got over their shyness, and 'ad really\r\nbegun to play games, we backed out o' the pit and went down, by steps,\r\nto the camp below, no man, as you might say, making us afraid. Here we\r\nenjoyed a front view of the battle, which rolled with renewed impetus,\r\nowing to both sides receiving strong reinforcements every minute. All\r\narms were freely represented; Cavalry, on this occasion only, acting in\r\nconcert with Artillery. They argued the relative merits of horses\r\n_versus_ feet, so to say, but they didn't neglect Persimmon. The wounded\r\nrolling downhill with the wurzels informed us that he had long ago been\r\nsocialised, and the smallest souvenirs were worth a man's life. Speaking\r\nbroadly, the Junior Service appeared to be a shade out of 'and, if I may\r\nventure so far. They did _not_ pay prompt and unhesitating obedience to\r\nthe \"Retires\" or the \"Cease Fires\" or the \"For 'Eaven's sake come to\r\nbed, ducky\" of their officers, who, I regret to say, were 'otly\r\nembroiled at the heads of their respective units.'\r\n\r\n'How did you find that out?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'On account of Lootenant Morshed going to the Mess tent to call on his\r\nuncle and raise a drink; but all hands had gone to the front. We thought\r\nwe 'eard somebody bathing behind the tent, and we found an oldish\r\ngentleman tryin' to drown a boy in knickerbockers in a horse-trough. He\r\nkept him under with a bicycle, so to speak. He 'ad nearly accomplished\r\nhis fell design, when we frustrated him. He was in a highly malleable\r\ncondition and full o' _juice de spree_. \"Arsk not what I am,\" he says.\r\n\"My wife 'll tell me that quite soon enough. Arsk rather what I've\r\nbeen,\" he says. \"I've been dinin' here,\" he says. \"I commanded 'em in\r\nthe Eighties,\" he says, \"and, Gawd forgive me,\" he says, sobbin'\r\n'eavily, \"I've spent this holy evening telling their Colonel they was a\r\nset of educated inefficients. Hark to 'em!\" We could, without strainin'\r\nourselves; but how _he_ picked up the gentle murmur of his own corps in\r\nthat on-the-knee party up the hill I don't know. \"They've marched and\r\nfought thirty mile to-day,\" he shouts, \"and now they're tearin' the\r\n_intestines_ out of the Cavalry up yonder! They won't stop this side the\r\ngates o' Delhi,\" he says. \"I commanded their ancestors. There's nothing\r\nwrong with the Service,\" he says, wringing out his trousers on his lap.\r\n\"'Eaven pardon me for doubtin' 'em! Same old game--same young beggars.\"\r\n\r\n'The boy in the knickerbockers, languishing on a chair, puts in a claim\r\nfor one drink. \"Let him go dry,\" says our friend in shirt-tails. \"He's a\r\nreporter. He run into me on his filthy bicycle and he asked me if I\r\ncould furnish 'im with particulars about the mutiny in the Army. You\r\nfalse-'earted proletarian publicist,\" he says, shakin' his finger at\r\n'im--for he was reelly annoyed--\"I'll teach you to defile what you can't\r\ncomprebend! When my regiment's in a state o' mutiny, I'll do myself the\r\nhonour of informing you personally. You particularly ignorant and very\r\nnarsty little man,\" he says, \"you're no better than a dhobi's donkey! If\r\nthere wasn't dirty linen to wash, you'd starve,\" he says, \"and why I\r\nhaven't drowned you will be the lastin' regret of my life.\"\r\n\r\n'Well, we sat with 'em and 'ad drinks for about half-an-hour in front\r\nof the Mess tent. He'd ha' killed the reporter if there hadn't been\r\nwitnesses, and the reporter might have taken notes of the battle; so we\r\nacted as two-way buffers, in a sense. I don't hold with the Press\r\nmingling up with Service matters. They draw false conclusions. Now, mark\r\nyou, at a moderate estimate, there were seven thousand men in the\r\nfighting line, half of 'em hurt in their professional feelings, an' the\r\nother half rubbin' in the liniment, as you might say. All due to\r\nPersimmon! If you 'adn't seen it you wouldn't 'ave believed it. And yet,\r\nmark you, not one single unit of 'em even resorted to his belt. They\r\nconfined themselves to natural producks--hands and the wurzels. I\r\nthought Jules was havin' fits, till it trarnspired the same thought had\r\nimpressed him in the French language. He called it _incroyable_, I\r\nbelieve. Seven thousand men, with seven thousand rifles, belts, and\r\nbayonets, in a violently agitated condition, and not a ungenteel blow\r\nstruck from first to last. The old gentleman drew our attention to it as\r\nwell. It was quite noticeable.\r\n\r\n'Lack of ammunition was the primerry cause of the battle ceasin'. A\r\nBrigade-Major came in, wipin' his nose on both cuffs, and sayin' he 'ad\r\n'ad snuff. The brigadier-uncle followed. He was, so to speak, sneezin'.\r\nWe thought it best to shift our moorings without attractin' attention;\r\nso we shifted. They 'ad called the cows 'ome by then. The Junior Service\r\nwas going to bye-bye all round us, as happy as the ship's monkey when\r\nhe's been playin' with the paints, and Lootenant Morshed and Jules kept\r\nbowin' to port and starboard of the superstructure, acknowledgin' the\r\nunstinted applause which the multitude would 'ave given 'em if they'd\r\nknown the facts. On the other 'and, as your Mr. Leggatt observed, they\r\nmight 'ave killed us.\r\n\r\n'That would have been about five bells in the middle watch, say\r\nhalf-past two. A well-spent evening. There was but little to be gained\r\nby entering Portsmouth at that hour, so we turned off on the grass (this\r\nwas after we had found a road under us), and we cast anchors out at the\r\nstern and prayed for the day.\r\n\r\n'But your Mr. Leggatt he had to make and mend tyres all our watch below.\r\nIt trarnspired she had been running on the rim o' two or three wheels,\r\nwhich, very properly, he hadn't reported till the close of the action.\r\nAnd that's the reason of your four new tyres. Mr. Morshed was of opinion\r\nyou'd earned 'em. Do you dissent?'\r\n\r\nI stretched out my hand, which Pyecroft crushed to pulp. 'No, Pye,' I\r\nsaid, deeply moved, 'I agree entirely. But what happened to Jules?'\r\n\r\n'We returned him to his own Navy after breakfast. He wouldn't have kept\r\nmuch longer without some one in his own language to tell it to. I don't\r\nknow any man I ever took more compassion on than Jules. 'Is sufferings\r\nswelled him up centimetres, and all he could do on the Hard was to kiss\r\nLootenant Morshed and me, _and_ your Mr. Leggatt. He deserved that much.\r\nA cordial beggar.'\r\n\r\nPyecroft looked at the washed cups on the table, and the low sunshine\r\non my car's back in the yard.\r\n\r\n'Too early to drink to him,' he said. 'But I feel it just the same.'\r\n\r\nThe uncle, sunk in his chair, snored a little; the canary answered with\r\na shrill lullaby. Pyecroft picked up the duster, threw it over the cage,\r\nput his finger to his lips, and we tiptoed out into the shop, while\r\nLeggatt brought the car round.\r\n\r\n'I'll look out for the news in the papers,' I said, as I got in.\r\n\r\n'Oh, we short-circuited that! Nothing trarnspired excep' a statement to\r\nthe effect that some Territorial battalions had played about with\r\nturnips at the conclusion of the manoeuvres The taxpayer don't know all\r\nhe gets for his money. Farewell!'\r\n\r\nWe moved off just in time to be blocked by a regiment coming towards the\r\nstation to entrain for London.\r\n\r\n'Beg your pardon, sir,' said a sergeant in charge of the baggage, 'but\r\nwould you mind backin' a bit till we get the waggons past?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly,' I said. 'You don't happen to have a rocking-horse among\r\nyour kit, do you?'\r\n\r\nThe rattle of our reverse drowned his answer, but I saw his eyes. One of\r\nthem was blackish-green, about four days old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF MIRTH\r\n\r\n     The Four Archangels, so the legends tell,\r\n     Raphael, Gabriel, Michael, Azrael,\r\n     Being first of those to whom the Power was shown,\r\n     Stood first of all the Host before The Throne,\r\n     And when the Charges were allotted burst\r\n     Tumultuous-winged from out the assembly first.\r\n     Zeal was their spur that bade them strictly heed\r\n     Their own high judgment on their lightest deed.\r\n     Zeal was their spur that, when relief was given,\r\n     Urged them unwearied to fresh toil in Heaven;\r\n     For Honour's sake perfecting every task\r\n     Beyond what e'en Perfection's self could ask....\r\n     And Allah, Who created Zeal and Pride,\r\n     Knows how the twain are perilous-near allied.\r\n\r\n     It chanced on one of Heaven's long-lighted days,\r\n     The Four and all the Host having gone their ways\r\n     Each to his Charge, the shining Courts were void\r\n     Save for one Seraph whom no charge employed,\r\n     With folden wings and slumber-threatened brow.\r\n     To whom The Word: 'Beloved, what dost thou?'\r\n     'By the Permission,' came the answer soft,\r\n     'Little I do nor do that little oft.\r\n     As is The Will in Heaven so on Earth\r\n     Where by The Will I strive to make men mirth.'\r\n     He ceased and sped, hearing The Word once more:\r\n     'Beloved, go thy way and greet the Four.'\r\n\r\n     Systems and Universes overpast,\r\n     The Seraph came upon the Four, at last,\r\n     Guiding and guarding with devoted mind\r\n     The tedious generations of mankind\r\n     Who lent at most unwilling ear and eye\r\n     When they could not escape the ministry....\r\n     Yet, patient, faithful, firm, persistent, just\r\n     Toward all that gross, indifferent, facile dust,\r\n     The Archangels laboured to discharge their trust\r\n     By precept and example, prayer and law,\r\n     Advice, reproof, and rule, but, labouring, saw\r\n     Each in his fellow's countenance confessed,\r\n     The Doubt that sickens: 'Have I done my best?'\r\n\r\n     Even as they sighed and turned to toil anew,\r\n     The Seraph hailed them with observance due;\r\n     And after some fit talk of higher things\r\n     Touched tentative on mundane happenings.\r\n     This they permitting, he, emboldened thus,\r\n     Prolused of humankind promiscuous.\r\n     And, since the large contention less avails\r\n     Than instances observed, he told them tales--Tales\r\n     of the shop, the bed, the court, the street,\r\n     Intimate, elemental, indiscreet:\r\n     Occasions where Confusion smiting swift\r\n     Piles jest on jest as snow-slides pile the drift.\r\n\r\n     Whence, one by one, beneath derisive skies,\r\n     The victims bare, bewildered heads arise:\r\n     Tales of the passing of the spirit, graced\r\n     With humour blinding as the doom it faced:\r\n     Stark tales of ribaldry that broke aside\r\n     To tears, by laughter swallowed ere they dried:\r\n     Tales to which neither grace nor gain accrue,\r\n     But only (Allah be exalted!) true,\r\n     And only, as the Seraph showed that night,\r\n     Delighting to the limits of delight.\r\n\r\n     These he rehearsed with artful pause and halt,\r\n     And such pretence of memory at fault,\r\n     That soon the Four--so well the bait was thrown--\r\n     Came to his aid with memories of their own--\r\n     Matters dismissed long since as small or vain,\r\n     Whereof the high significance had lain\r\n     Hid, till the ungirt glosses made it plain.\r\n     Then as enlightenment came broad and fast,\r\n     Each marvelled at his own oblivious past\r\n     Until--the Gates of Laughter opened wide--\r\n     The Four, with that bland Seraph at their side,\r\n     While they recalled, compared, and amplified,\r\n     In utter mirth forgot both zeal and pride.\r\n\r\n     High over Heaven the lamps of midnight burned\r\n     Ere, weak with merriment, the Four returned,\r\n     Not in that order they were wont to keep--\r\n     Pinion to pinion answering, sweep for sweep,\r\n     In awful diapason heard afar,\r\n     But shoutingly adrift 'twixt star and star.\r\n     Reeling a planet's orbit left or right\r\n     As laughter took them in the abysmal Night;\r\n     Or, by the point of some remembered jest,\r\n     Winged and brought helpless down through gulfs unguessed,\r\n     Where the blank worlds that gather to the birth\r\n     Leaped in the womb of Darkness at their mirth,\r\n     And e'en Gehenna's bondsmen understood.\r\n     They were not damned from human brotherhood.\r\n\r\n     Not first nor last of Heaven's high Host, the Four\r\n     That night took place beneath The Throne once more.\r\n     O lovelier than their morning majesty,\r\n     The understanding light behind the eye!\r\n     O more compelling than their old command,\r\n     The new-learned friendly gesture of the hand!\r\n     O sweeter than their zealous fellowship,\r\n     The wise half-smile that passed from lip to lip!\r\n     O well and roundly, when Command was given,\r\n     They told their tale against themselves to Heaven,\r\n     And in the silence, waiting on The Word,\r\n     Received the Peace and Pardon of The Lord!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'My Son's Wife'\r\n\r\n(1913)\r\n\r\nHe had suffered from the disease of the century since his early youth,\r\nand before he was thirty he was heavily marked with it. He and a few\r\nfriends had rearranged Heaven very comfortably, but the reorganisation\r\nof Earth, which they called Society, was even greater fun. It demanded\r\nWork in the shape of many taxi-rides daily; hours of brilliant talk with\r\nbrilliant talkers; some sparkling correspondence; a few silences (but on\r\nthe understanding that their own turn should come soon) while other\r\npeople expounded philosophies; and a fair number of picture-galleries,\r\ntea-fights, concerts, theatres, music-halls, and cinema shows; the whole\r\ntrimmed with love-making to women whose hair smelt of cigarette-smoke.\r\nSuch strong days sent Frankwell Midmore back to his flat assured that he\r\nand his friends had helped the World a step nearer the Truth, the Dawn,\r\nand the New Order.\r\n\r\nHis temperament, he said, led him more towards concrete data than\r\nabstract ideas. People who investigate detail are apt to be tired at the\r\nday's end. The same temperament, or it may have been a woman, made him\r\nearly attach himself to the Immoderate Left of his Cause in the capacity\r\nof an experimenter in Social Relations. And since the Immoderate Left\r\ncontains plenty of women anxious to help earnest inquirers with large\r\nindependent incomes to arrive at evaluations of essentials, Frankwell\r\nMidmore's lot was far from contemptible.\r\n\r\nAt that hour Fate chose to play with him. A widowed aunt, widely\r\nseparated by nature, and more widely by marriage, from all that\r\nMidmore's mother had ever been or desired to be, died and left him\r\npossessions. Mrs. Midmore, having that summer embraced a creed which\r\ndenied the existence of death, naturally could not stoop to burial; but\r\nMidmore had to leave London for the dank country at a season when Social\r\nRegeneration works best through long, cushioned conferences, two by two,\r\nafter tea. There he faced the bracing ritual of the British funeral, and\r\nwas wept at across the raw grave by an elderly coffin-shaped female with\r\na long nose, who called him 'Master Frankie'; and there he was\r\ncongratulated behind an echoing top-hat by a man he mistook for a mute,\r\nwho turned out to be his aunt's lawyer. He wrote his mother next day,\r\nafter a bright account of the funeral:\r\n\r\n'So far as I can understand, she has left me between four and five\r\nhundred a year. It all comes from Ther Land, as they call it down here.\r\nThe unspeakable attorney, Sperrit, and a green-eyed daughter, who hums\r\nto herself as she tramps but is silent on all subjects except \"huntin',\"\r\ninsisted on taking me to see it. Ther Land is brown and green in\r\nalternate slabs like chocolate and pistachio cakes, speckled with\r\noccasional peasants who do not utter. In case it should not be wet\r\nenough there is a wet brook in the middle of it. Ther House is by the\r\nbrook. I shall look into it later. If there should be any little memento\r\nof Jenny that you care for, let me know. Didn't you tell me that\r\nmid-Victorian furniture is coming into the market again? Jenny's old\r\nmaid--it is called Rhoda Dolbie--tells me that Jenny promised it thirty\r\npounds a year. The will does not. Hence, I suppose, the tears at the\r\nfuneral. But that is close on ten per cent of the income. I fancy Jenny\r\nhas destroyed all her private papers and records of her _vie intime_,\r\nif, indeed, life be possible in such a place. The Sperrit man told me\r\nthat if I had means of my own I might come and live on Ther Land. I\r\ndidn't tell him how much I would pay not to! I cannot think it right\r\nthat any human being should exercise mastery over others in the\r\nmerciless fashion our tom-fool social system permits; so, as it is all\r\nmine, I intend to sell it whenever the unholy Sperrit can find a\r\npurchaser.'\r\n\r\nAnd he went to Mr. Sperrit with the idea next day, just before returning\r\nto town.\r\n\r\n'Quite so,' said the lawyer. 'I see your point, of course. But the house\r\nitself is rather old-fashioned--hardly the type purchasers demand\r\nnowadays. There's no park, of course, and the bulk of the land is let to\r\na life-tenant, a Mr. Sidney. As long as he pays his rent, he can't be\r\nturned out, and even if he didn't'--Mr. Sperrit's face relaxed a\r\nshade--'you might have a difficulty.'\r\n\r\n'The property brings four hundred a year, I understand,' said Midmore.\r\n\r\n'Well, hardly--ha-ardly. Deducting land and income tax, tithes, fire\r\ninsurance, cost of collection and repairs of course, it returned two\r\nhundred and eighty-four pounds last year. The repairs are rather a large\r\nitem--owing to the brook. I call it Liris--out of Horace, you know.'\r\n\r\nMidmore looked at his watch impatiently.\r\n\r\n'I suppose you can find somebody to buy it?' he repeated.\r\n\r\n'We will do our best, of course, if those are your instructions. Then,\r\nthat is all except'--here Midmore half rose, but Mr. Sperrit's little\r\ngrey eyes held his large brown ones firmly--'except about Rhoda Dolbie,\r\nMrs. Werf's maid. I may tell you that we did not draw up your aunt's\r\nlast will. She grew secretive towards the last--elderly people often\r\ndo--and had it done in London. I expect her memory failed her, or she\r\nmislaid her notes. She used to put them in her spectacle-case.... My\r\nmotor only takes eight minutes to get to the station, Mr. Midmore ...\r\nbut, as I was saying, whenever she made her will with _us_, Mrs. Werf\r\nalways left Rhoda thirty pounds per annum. Charlie, the wills!' A clerk\r\nwith a baldish head and a long nose dealt documents on to the table like\r\ncards, and breathed heavily behind Midmore. 'It's in no sense a legal\r\nobligation, of course,' said Mr. Sperrit. 'Ah, that one is dated January\r\nthe 11th, eighteen eighty-nine.'\r\n\r\nMidmore looked at his watch again and found himself saying with no good\r\ngrace: 'Well, I suppose she'd better have it--for the present at\r\nany rate.'\r\n\r\nHe escaped with an uneasy feeling that two hundred and fifty-four pounds\r\na year was not exactly four hundred, and that Charlie's long nose\r\nannoyed him. Then he returned, first-class, to his own affairs.\r\n\r\nOf the two, perhaps three, experiments in Social Relations which he had\r\nthen in hand, one interested him acutely. It had run for some months and\r\npromised most variegated and interesting developments, on which he dwelt\r\nluxuriously all the way to town. When he reached his flat he was not\r\nwell prepared for a twelve-page letter explaining, in the diction of the\r\nImmoderate Left which rubricates its I's and illuminates its T's, that\r\nthe lady had realised greater attractions in another Soul. She\r\nre-stated, rather than pleaded, the gospel of the Immoderate Left as her\r\njustification, and ended in an impassioned demand for her right to\r\nexpress herself in and on her own life, through which, she pointed out,\r\nshe could pass but once. She added that if, later, she should discover\r\nMidmore was 'essentially complementary to her needs,' she would tell him\r\nso. That Midmore had himself written much the same sort of\r\nepistle--barring the hint of return--to a woman of whom his needs for\r\nself-expression had caused him to weary three years before, did not\r\nassist him in the least. He expressed himself to the gas-fire in terms\r\nessential but not complimentary. Then he reflected on the detached\r\ncriticism of his best friends and her best friends, male and female,\r\nwith whom he and she and others had talked so openly while their gay\r\nadventure was in flower. He recalled, too--this must have been about\r\nmidnight--her analysis from every angle, remote and most intimate, of\r\nthe mate to whom she had been adjudged under the base convention which\r\nis styled marriage. Later, at that bad hour when the cattle wake for a\r\nlittle, he remembered her in other aspects and went down into the hell\r\nappointed; desolate, desiring, with no God to call upon. About eleven\r\no'clock next morning Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and\r\nZophar the Naamathite called upon him 'for they had made appointment\r\ntogether' to see how he took it; but the janitor told them that Job had\r\ngone--into the country, he believed.\r\n\r\nMidmore's relief when he found his story was not written across his\r\naching temples for Mr. Sperrit to read--the defeated lover, like the\r\nsuccessful one, believes all earth privy to his soul--was put down by\r\nMr. Sperrit to quite different causes. He led him into a morning-room.\r\nThe rest of the house seemed to be full of people, singing to a loud\r\npiano idiotic songs about cows, and the hall smelt of damp cloaks.\r\n\r\n'It's our evening to take the winter cantata,' Mr. Sperrit explained.\r\n'It's \"High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire.\" I hoped you'd come back.\r\nThere are scores of little things to settle. As for the house, of\r\ncourse, it stands ready for you at any time. I couldn't get Rhoda out of\r\nit--nor could Charlie for that matter. She's the sister, isn't she, of\r\nthe nurse who brought you down here when you were four, she says, to\r\nrecover from measles?'\r\n\r\n'Is she? Was I?' said Midmore through the bad tastes in his mouth.\r\n'D'you suppose I could stay there the night?'\r\n\r\nThirty joyous young voices shouted appeal to some one to leave their\r\n'pipes of parsley 'ollow--'ollow--'ollow!' Mr. Sperrit had to raise his\r\nvoice above the din.\r\n\r\n'Well, if I asked you to stay _here_, I should never hear the last of it\r\nfrom Rhoda. She's a little cracked, of course, but the soul of devotion\r\nand capable of anything. _Ne sit ancillae_, you know.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you. Then I'll go. I'll walk.' He stumbled out dazed and sick\r\ninto the winter twilight, and sought the square house by the brook.\r\n\r\nIt was not a dignified entry, because when the door was unchained and\r\nRhoda exclaimed, he took two valiant steps into the hall and then\r\nfainted--as men sometimes will after twenty-two hours of strong emotion\r\nand little food.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry,' he said when he could speak. He was lying at the foot of\r\nthe stairs, his head on Rhoda's lap.\r\n\r\n'Your 'ome is your castle, sir,' was the reply in his hair. 'I smelt it\r\nwasn't drink. You lay on the sofa till I get your supper.'\r\n\r\nShe settled him in a drawing-room hung with yellow silk, heavy with the\r\nsmell of dead leaves and oil lamp. Something murmured soothingly in the\r\nbackground and overcame the noises in his head. He thought he heard\r\nhorses' feet on wet gravel and a voice singing about ships and flocks\r\nand grass. It passed close to the shuttered bay-window.\r\n\r\n     But each will mourn his own, she saith,\r\n     And sweeter woman ne'er drew breath\r\n     Than my son's wife, Elizabeth ...\r\n     Cusha--cusha--cusha--calling.\r\n\r\nThe hoofs broke into a canter as Rhoda entered with the tray. 'And then\r\nI'll put you to bed,' she said. 'Sidney's coming in the morning.'\r\nMidmore asked no questions. He dragged his poor bruised soul to bed and\r\nwould have pitied it all over again, but the food and warm sherry and\r\nwater drugged him to instant sleep.\r\n\r\nRhoda's voice wakened him, asking whether he would have ''ip, foot, or\r\nsitz,' which he understood were the baths of the establishment. 'Suppose\r\nyou try all three,' she suggested. 'They're all yours, you know, sir.'\r\n\r\nHe would have renewed his sorrows with the daylight, but her words\r\nstruck him pleasantly. Everything his eyes opened upon was his very own\r\nto keep for ever. The carved four-post Chippendale bed, obviously worth\r\nhundreds; the wavy walnut William and Mary chairs--he had seen worse\r\nones labelled twenty guineas apiece; the oval medallion mirror; the\r\ndelicate eighteenth-century wire fireguard; the heavy brocaded curtains\r\nwere his--all his. So, too, a great garden full of birds that faced him\r\nwhen he shaved; a mulberry tree, a sun-dial, and a dull, steel-coloured\r\nbrook that murmured level with the edge of a lawn a hundred yards away.\r\nPeculiarly and privately his own was the smell of sausages and coffee\r\nthat he sniffed at the head of the wide square landing, all set round\r\nwith mysterious doors and Bartolozzi prints. He spent two hours after\r\nbreakfast in exploring his new possessions. His heart leaped up at such\r\nthings as sewing-machines, a rubber-tyred bath-chair in a tiled passage,\r\na malachite-headed Malacca cane, boxes and boxes of unopened stationery,\r\nseal-rings, bunches of keys, and at the bottom of a steel-net reticule a\r\nlittle leather purse with seven pounds ten shillings in gold and eleven\r\nshillings in silver.\r\n\r\n'You used to play with that when my sister brought you down here after\r\nyour measles,' said Rhoda as he slipped the money into his pocket. 'Now,\r\nthis was your pore dear auntie's business-room.' She opened a low door.\r\n'Oh, I forgot about Mr. Sidney! There he is.' An enormous old man with\r\nrheumy red eyes that blinked under downy white eyebrows sat in an Empire\r\nchair, his cap in his hands. Rhoda withdrew sniffing. The man looked\r\nMidmore over in silence, then jerked a thumb towards the door. 'I reckon\r\nshe told you who I be,' he began. 'I'm the only farmer you've got.\r\nNothin' goes off my place 'thout it walks on its own feet. What about my\r\npig-pound?'\r\n\r\n'Well, what about it?' said Midmore.\r\n\r\n'That's just what I be come about. The County Councils are getting more\r\nparticular. Did ye know there was swine fever at Pashell's? There _be_.\r\nIt'll 'ave to be in brick.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Midmore politely.\r\n\r\n'I've bin at your aunt that was, plenty times about it. I don't say she\r\nwasn't a just woman, but she didn't read the lease same way I did. I be\r\nused to bein' put upon, but there's no doing any longer 'thout that\r\npig-pound.'\r\n\r\n'When would you like it?' Midmore asked. It seemed the easiest road to\r\ntake.\r\n\r\n'Any time or other suits me, I reckon. He ain't thrivin' where he is,\r\nan' I paid eighteen shillin' for him.' He crossed his hands on his stick\r\nand gave no further sign of life.\r\n\r\n'Is that all?' Midmore stammered.\r\n\r\n'All now--excep''--he glanced fretfully at the table beside him--'excep'\r\nmy usuals. Where's that Rhoda?'\r\n\r\nMidmore rang the bell. Rhoda came in with a bottle and a glass. The old\r\nman helped himself to four stiff fingers, rose in one piece, and stumped\r\nout. At the door he cried ferociously: 'Don't suppose it's any odds to\r\nyou whether I'm drowned or not, but them floodgates want a wheel and\r\nwinch, they do. I be too old for liftin' 'em with the bar--my time\r\no' life.'\r\n\r\n'Good riddance if 'e was drowned,' said Rhoda. 'But don't you mind him.\r\nHe's only amusin' himself. Your pore dear auntie used to give 'im 'is\r\nusual--'tisn't the whisky _you_ drink--an' send 'im about 'is business.'\r\n\r\n'I see. Now, is a pig-pound the same thing as a pig-sty?'\r\n\r\nRhoda nodded. ''E needs one, too, but 'e ain't entitled to it. You look\r\nat 'is lease--third drawer on the left in that Bombay cab'net--an' next\r\ntime 'e comes you ask 'im to read it. That'll choke 'im off, because\r\n'e can't!'\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in Midmore's past to teach him the message and\r\nsignificance of a hand-written lease of the late 'eighties, but Rhoda\r\ninterpreted.\r\n\r\n'It don't mean anything reelly,' was her cheerful conclusion, 'excep'\r\nyou mustn't get rid of him anyhow, an' 'e can do what 'e likes always.\r\nLucky for us 'e _do_ farm; and if it wasn't for 'is woman--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, there's a Mrs. Sidney, is there?'\r\n\r\n'Lor, _no_!' The Sidneys don't marry. They keep. That's his fourth\r\nsince--to my knowledge. He was a takin' man from the first.'\r\n\r\n'Any families?'\r\n\r\n'They'd be grown up by now if there was, wouldn't they? But you can't\r\nspend all your days considerin' 'is interests. That's what gave your\r\npore aunt 'er indigestion. 'Ave you seen the gun-room?'\r\n\r\nMidmore held strong views on the immorality of taking life for pleasure.\r\nBut there was no denying that the late Colonel Werf's seventy-guinea\r\nbreechloaders were good at their filthy job. He loaded one, took it out\r\nand pointed--merely pointed--it at a cock-pheasant which rose out of a\r\nshrubbery behind the kitchen, and the flaming bird came down in a long\r\nslant on the lawn, stone dead. Rhoda from the scullery said it was a\r\nlovely shot, and told him lunch was ready.\r\n\r\nHe spent the afternoon gun in one hand, a map in the other, beating the\r\nbounds of his lands. They lay altogether in a shallow, uninteresting\r\nvalley, flanked with woods and bisected by a brook. Up stream was his\r\nown house; down stream, less than half a mile, a low red farm-house\r\nsquatted in an old orchard, beside what looked like small lock-gates on\r\nthe Thames. There was no doubt as to ownership. Mr. Sidney saw him while\r\nyet far off, and bellowed at him about pig-pounds and floodgates. These\r\nlast were two great sliding shutters of weedy oak across the brook,\r\nwhich were prised up inch by inch with a crowbar along a notched strip\r\nof iron, and when Sidney opened them they at once let out half the\r\nwater. Midmore watched it shrink between its aldered banks like some\r\nconjuring trick. This, too, was his very own.\r\n\r\n'I see,' he said. 'How interesting! Now, what's that bell for?' he went\r\non, pointing to an old ship's bell in a rude belfry at the end of an\r\nouthouse. 'Was that a chapel once?' The red-eyed giant seemed to have\r\ndifficulty in expressing himself for the moment and blinked savagely.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he said at last. 'My chapel. When you 'ear that bell ring you'll\r\n'ear something. Nobody but me 'ud put up with it--but I reckon it don't\r\nmake any odds to you.' He slammed the gates down again, and the brook\r\nrose behind them with a suck and a grunt.\r\n\r\nMidmore moved off, conscious that he might be safer with Rhoda to hold\r\nhis conversational hand. As he passed the front of the farm-house a\r\nsmooth fat woman, with neatly parted grey hair under a widow's cap,\r\ncurtsied to him deferentially through the window. By every teaching of\r\nthe Immoderate Left she had a perfect right to express herself in any\r\nway she pleased, but the curtsey revolted him. And on his way home he\r\nwas hailed from behind a hedge by a manifest idiot with no roof to his\r\nmouth, who hallooed and danced round him.\r\n\r\n'What did that beast want?' he demanded of Rhoda at tea.\r\n\r\n'Jimmy? He only wanted to know if you 'ad any telegrams to send. 'E'll\r\ngo anywhere so long as 'tisn't across running water. That gives 'im 'is\r\nseizures. Even talkin' about it for fun like makes 'im shake.'\r\n\r\n'But why isn't he where he can be properly looked after?'\r\n\r\n'What 'arm's 'e doing? E's a love-child, but 'is family can pay for 'im.\r\nIf 'e was locked up 'e'd die all off at once, like a wild rabbit. Won't\r\nyou, please, look at the drive, sir?'\r\n\r\nMidmore looked in the fading light. The neat gravel was pitted with\r\nlarge roundish holes, and there was a punch or two of the same sort\r\non the lawn.\r\n\r\n'That's the 'unt comin' 'ome,' Rhoda explained. 'Your pore dear auntie\r\nalways let 'em use our drive for a short cut after the Colonel died. The\r\nColonel wouldn't so much because he preserved; but your auntie was\r\nalways an 'orsewoman till 'er sciatica.'\r\n\r\n'Isn't there some one who can rake it over or--or something?' said\r\nMidmore vaguely.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes. You'll never see it in the morning, but--you was out when they\r\ncame 'ome an' Mister Fisher--he's the Master--told me to tell you with\r\n'is compliments that if you wasn't preservin' and cared to 'old to the\r\nold understanding', is gravel-pit is at your service same as before. 'E\r\nthought, perhaps, you mightn't know, and it 'ad slipped my mind to tell\r\nyou. It's good gravel, Mister Fisher's, and it binds beautiful on the\r\ndrive. We 'ave to draw it, o' course, from the pit, but--'\r\n\r\nMidmore looked at her helplessly.\r\n\r\n'Rhoda,' said he, 'what am I supposed to do?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, let 'em come through,' she replied. 'You never know. You may want\r\nto 'unt yourself some day.'\r\n\r\nThat evening it rained and his misery returned on him, the worse for\r\nhaving been diverted. At last he was driven to paw over a few score\r\nbooks in a panelled room called the library, and realised with horror\r\nwhat the late Colonel Werf's mind must have been in its prime. The\r\nvolumes smelt of a dead world as strongly as they did of mildew. He\r\nopened and thrust them back, one after another, till crude coloured\r\nillustrations of men on horses held his eye. He began at random and read\r\na little, moved into the drawing-room with the volume, and settled down\r\nby the fire still reading. It was a foul world into which he peeped for\r\nthe first time--a heavy-eating, hard-drinking hell of horse-copers,\r\nswindlers, matchmaking mothers, economically dependent virgins selling\r\nthemselves blushingly for cash and lands: Jews, tradesmen, and an\r\nill-considered spawn of Dickens-and-horsedung characters (I give\r\nMidmore's own criticism), but he read on, fascinated, and behold, from\r\nthe pages leaped, as it were, the brother to the red-eyed man of the\r\nbrook, bellowing at a landlord (here Midmore realised that _he_ was that\r\nvery animal) for new barns; and another man who, like himself again,\r\nobjected to hoof-marks on gravel. Outrageous as thought and conception\r\nwere, the stuff seemed to have the rudiments of observation. He dug out\r\nother volumes by the same author, till Rhoda came in with a silver\r\ncandlestick.\r\n\r\n'Rhoda,' said he, 'did you ever hear about a character called James\r\nPigg--and Batsey?'\r\n\r\n'Why, o' course,' said she. 'The Colonel used to come into the kitchen\r\nin 'is dressin'-gown an' read us all those Jorrockses.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Lord!' said Midmore, and went to bed with a book called _Handley\r\nCross_ under his arm, and a lonelier Columbus into a stranger world the\r\nwet-ringed moon never looked upon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere we omit much. But Midmore never denied that for the epicure in\r\nsensation the urgent needs of an ancient house, as interpreted by Rhoda\r\npointing to daylight through attic-tiles held in place by moss, gives an\r\nedge to the pleasure of Social Research elsewhere. Equally he found that\r\nthe reaction following prolonged research loses much of its grey terror\r\nif one knows one can at will bathe the soul in the society of plumbers\r\n(all the water-pipes had chronic appendicitis), village idiots (Jimmy\r\nhad taken Midmore under his weak wing and camped daily at the\r\ndrive-gates), and a giant with red eyelids whose every action is an\r\nunpredictable outrage.\r\n\r\nTowards spring Midmore filled his house with a few friends of the\r\nImmoderate Left. It happened to be the day when, all things and Rhoda\r\nworking together, a cartload of bricks, another of sand, and some bags\r\nof lime had been despatched to build Sidney his almost daily-demanded\r\npig-pound. Midmore took his friends across the flat fields with some\r\nidea of showing them Sidney as a type of 'the peasantry.' They hit the\r\nminute when Sidney, hoarse with rage, was ordering bricklayer, mate,\r\ncarts and all off his premises. The visitors disposed themselves\r\nto listen.\r\n\r\n'You never give me no notice about changin' the pig,' Sidney shouted.\r\nThe pig--at least eighteen inches long--reared on end in the old sty and\r\nsmiled at the company.\r\n\r\n'But, my good man--' Midmore opened.\r\n\r\n'I ain't! For aught you know I be a dam' sight worse than you be. You\r\ncan't come and be'ave arbit'ry with me. You _are_ be'avin' arbit'ry! All\r\nyou men go clean away an' don't set foot on my land till I bid ye.'\r\n\r\n'But you asked'--Midmore felt his voice jump up--'to have the pig-pound\r\nbuilt.'\r\n\r\n''Spose I did. That's no reason you shouldn't send me notice to change\r\nthe pig. 'Comin' down on me like this 'thout warnin'! That pig's got to\r\nbe got into the cowshed an' all.'\r\n\r\n'Then open the door and let him run in,' said Midmore.\r\n\r\n'Don't you be'ave arbit'ry with _me_! Take all your dam' men 'ome off my\r\nland. I won't be treated arbit'ry.'\r\n\r\nThe carts moved off without a word, and Sidney went into the house and\r\nslammed the door.\r\n\r\n'Now, I hold that is enormously significant,' said a visitor. 'Here you\r\nhave the logical outcome of centuries of feudal oppression--the frenzy\r\nof fear.' The company looked at Midmore with grave pain.\r\n\r\n'But he _did_ worry my life out about his pig-sty,' was all Midmore\r\nfound to say.\r\n\r\nOthers took up the parable and proved to him if he only held true to the\r\ngospels of the Immoderate Left the earth would soon be covered with\r\n'jolly little' pig-sties, built in the intervals of morris-dancing by\r\n'the peasant' himself.\r\n\r\nMidmore felt grateful when the door opened again and Mr. Sidney invited\r\nthem all to retire to the road which, he pointed out, was public. As\r\nthey turned the corner of the house, a smooth-faced woman in a widow's\r\ncap curtsied to each of them through the window.\r\n\r\nInstantly they drew pictures of that woman's lot, deprived of all\r\nvehicle for self-expression--'the set grey life and apathetic end,' one\r\nquoted--and they discussed the tremendous significance of village\r\ntheatricals. Even a month ago Midmore would have told them all that he\r\nknew and Rhoda had dropped about Sidney's forms of self-expression. Now,\r\nfor some strange reason, he was content to let the talk run on from\r\nvillage to metropolitan and world drama.\r\n\r\nRhoda advised him after the visitors left that 'if he wanted to do that\r\nagain' he had better go up to town.\r\n\r\n'But we only sat on cushions on the floor,' said her master.\r\n\r\n'They're too old for romps,' she retorted, 'an' it's only the beginning\r\nof things. I've seen what _I've_ seen. Besides, they talked and laughed\r\nin the passage going to their baths--such as took 'em.'\r\n\r\n'Don't be a fool, Rhoda,' said Midmore. No man--unless he has loved\r\nher--will casually dismiss a woman on whose lap he has laid his head.\r\n\r\n'Very good,' she snorted, 'but that cuts both ways. An' now, you go down\r\nto Sidney's this evenin' and put him where he ought to be. He was in his\r\nright about you givin' 'im notice about changin' the pig, but he 'adn't\r\nany right to turn it up before your company. No manners, no pig-pound.\r\nHe'll understand.'\r\n\r\nMidmore did his best to make him. He found himself reviling the old man\r\nin speech and with a joy quite new in all his experience. He wound\r\nup--it was a plagiarism from a plumber--by telling Mr. Sidney that he\r\nlooked like a turkey-cock, had the morals of a parish bull, and need\r\nnever hope for a new pig-pound as long as he or Midmore lived.\r\n\r\n'Very good,' said the giant. 'I reckon you thought you 'ad something\r\nagainst me, and now you've come down an' told it me like man to man.\r\nQuite right. I don't bear malice. Now, you send along those bricks an'\r\nsand, an' I'll make a do to build the pig-pound myself. If you look at\r\nmy lease you'll find out you're bound to provide me materials for the\r\nrepairs. Only--only I thought there'd be no 'arm in my askin' you to do\r\nit throughout like.'\r\n\r\nMidmore fairly gasped. 'Then, why the devil did you turn my carts back\r\nwhen--when I sent them up here to do it throughout for you?'\r\n\r\nMr. Sidney sat down on the floodgates, his eyebrows knitted in thought.\r\n\r\n'I'll tell you,' he said slowly. ''Twas too dam' like cheatin' a suckin'\r\nbaby. My woman, she said so too.'\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds the teachings of the Immoderate Left, whose humour is\r\nall their own, wrestled with those of Mother Earth, who has her own\r\nhumours. Then Midmore laughed till he could scarcely stand. In due time\r\nMr. Sidney laughed too--crowing and wheezing crescendo till it broke\r\nfrom him in roars. They shook hands, and Midmore went home grateful that\r\nhe had held his tongue among his companions.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached his house he met three or four men and women on\r\nhorse-back, very muddy indeed, coming down the drive. Feeling hungry\r\nhimself, he asked them if they were hungry. They said they were, and he\r\nbade them enter. Jimmy took their horses, who seemed to know him. Rhoda\r\ntook their battered hats, led the women upstairs for hairpins, and\r\npresently fed them all with tea-cakes, poached eggs, anchovy toast, and\r\ndrinks from a coromandel-wood liqueur case which Midmore had never known\r\nthat he possessed.\r\n\r\n'And I _will_ say,' said Miss Connie Sperrit, her spurred foot on the\r\nfender and a smoking muffin in her whip hand, 'Rhoda does one top-hole.\r\nShe always did since I was eight.'\r\n\r\n'Seven, Miss, was when you began to 'unt,' said Rhoda, setting down more\r\nbuttered toast.\r\n\r\n'And so,' the M.F.H. was saying to Midmore, 'when he got to your brute\r\nSidney's land, we had to whip 'em off. It's a regular Alsatia for 'em.\r\nThey know it. Why'--he dropped his voice--'I don't want to say anything\r\nagainst Sidney as your tenant, of course, but I do believe the old\r\nscoundrel's perfectly capable of putting down poison.'\r\n\r\n'Sidney's capable of anything,' said Midmore with immense feeling; but\r\nonce again he held his tongue. They were a queer community; yet when\r\nthey had stamped and jingled out to their horses again, the house felt\r\nhugely big and disconcerting.\r\n\r\nThis may be reckoned the conscious beginning of his double life. It ran\r\nin odd channels that summer--a riding school, for instance, near Hayes\r\nCommon and a shooting ground near Wormwood Scrubs. A man who has been\r\nsaddle-galled or shoulder-bruised for half the day is not at his London\r\nbest of evenings; and when the bills for his amusements come in he\r\ncurtails his expenses in other directions. So a cloud settled on\r\nMidmore's name. His London world talked of a hardening of heart and a\r\ntightening of purse-strings which signified disloyalty to the Cause. One\r\nman, a confidant of the old expressive days, attacked him robustiously\r\nand demanded account of his soul's progress. It was not furnished, for\r\nMidmore was calculating how much it would cost to repave stables so\r\ndilapidated that even the village idiot apologised for putting visitors'\r\nhorses into them. The man went away, and served up what he had heard of\r\nthe pig-pound episode as a little newspaper sketch, calculated to annoy.\r\nMidmore read it with an eye as practical as a woman's, and since most of\r\nhis experiences had been among women, at once sought out a woman to whom\r\nhe might tell his sorrow at the disloyalty of his own familiar friend.\r\nShe was so sympathetic that he went on to confide how his bruised\r\nheart--she knew all about it--had found so-lace, with a long O, in\r\nanother quarter which he indicated rather carefully in case it might be\r\nbetrayed to other loyal friends. As his hints pointed directly towards\r\nfacile Hampstead, and as his urgent business was the purchase of a horse\r\nfrom a dealer, Beckenham way, he felt he had done good work. Later, when\r\nhis friend, the scribe, talked to him alluringly of 'secret gardens' and\r\nthose so-laces to which every man who follows the Wider Morality is\r\nentitled, Midmore lent him a five-pound note which he had got back on\r\nthe price of a ninety-guinea bay gelding. So true it is, as he read in\r\none of the late Colonel Werf's books, that 'the young man of the present\r\nday would sooner lie under an imputation against his morals than against\r\nhis knowledge of horse-flesh.'\r\n\r\nMidmore desired more than he desired anything else at that moment to\r\nride and, above all, to jump on a ninety-guinea bay gelding with black\r\npoints and a slovenly habit of hitting his fences. He did not wish many\r\npeople except Mr. Sidney, who very kindly lent his soft meadow behind\r\nthe floodgates, to be privy to the matter, which he rightly foresaw\r\nwould take him to the autumn. So he told such friends as hinted at\r\ncountry week-end visits that he had practically let his newly inherited\r\nhouse. The rent, he said, was an object to him, for he had lately lost\r\nlarge sums through ill-considered benevolences. He would name no names,\r\nbut they could guess. And they guessed loyally all round the circle of\r\nhis acquaintance as they spread the news that explained so much.\r\n\r\nThere remained only one couple of his once intimate associates to\r\npacify. They were deeply sympathetic and utterly loyal, of course, but\r\nas curious as any of the apes whose diet they had adopted. Midmore met\r\nthem in a suburban train, coming up to town, not twenty minutes after he\r\nhad come off two hours' advanced tuition (one guinea an hour) over\r\nhurdles in a hall. He had, of course, changed his kit, but his too heavy\r\nbridle-hand shook a little among the newspapers. On the inspiration of\r\nthe moment, which is your natural liar's best hold, he told them that he\r\nwas condemned to a rest-cure. He would lie in semi-darkness drinking\r\nmilk, for weeks and weeks, cut off even from letters. He was astonished\r\nand delighted at the ease with which the usual lie confounds the unusual\r\nintellect. They swallowed it as swiftly as they recommended him to live\r\non nuts and fruit; but he saw in the woman's eyes the exact reason she\r\nwould set forth for his retirement. After all, she had as much right to\r\nexpress herself as he purposed to take for himself; and Midmore believed\r\nstrongly in the fullest equality of the sexes.\r\n\r\nThat retirement made one small ripple in the strenuous world. The lady\r\nwho had written the twelve-page letter ten months before sent him\r\nanother of eight pages, analysing all the motives that were leading her\r\nback to him--should she come?--now that he was ill and alone. Much might\r\nyet be retrieved, she said, out of the waste of jarring lives and\r\npiteous misunderstandings. It needed only a hand.\r\n\r\nBut Midmore needed two, next morning very early, for a devil's\r\ndiversion, among wet coppices, called 'cubbing.'\r\n\r\n'You haven't a bad seat,' said Miss Sperrit through the morning-mists.\r\n'But you're worrying him.'\r\n\r\n'He pulls so,' Midmore grunted.\r\n\r\n'Let him alone, then. Look out for the branches,' she shouted, as they\r\nwhirled up a splashy ride. Cubs were plentiful. Most of the hounds\r\nattached themselves to a straight-necked youngster of education who\r\nscuttled out of the woods into the open fields below.\r\n\r\n'Hold on!' some one shouted. 'Turn 'em, Midmore. That's your brute\r\nSidney's land. It's all wire.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Connie, stop!' Mrs. Sperrit shrieked as her daughter charged at a\r\nboundary-hedge.\r\n\r\n'Wire be damned! I had it all out a fortnight ago. Come on!' This was\r\nMidmore, buffeting into it a little lower down.\r\n\r\n'_I_ knew that!' Connie cried over her shoulder, and she flitted across\r\nthe open pasture, humming to herself.\r\n\r\n'Oh, of course! If some people have private information, they can afford\r\nto thrust.' This was a snuff-coloured habit into which Miss Sperrit had\r\ncannoned down the ride.\r\n\r\n'What! 'Midmore got Sidney to heel? _You_ never did that, Sperrit.' This\r\nwas Mr. Fisher, M.F.H., enlarging the breach Midmore had made.\r\n\r\n'No, confound him!' said the father testily. 'Go on, sir! _Injecto ter\r\npulvere_--you've kicked half the ditch into my eye already.'\r\n\r\nThey killed that cub a little short of the haven his mother had told him\r\nto make for--a two-acre Alsatia of a gorse-patch to which the M.F.H. had\r\nbeen denied access for the last fifteen seasons. He expressed his\r\ngratitude before all the field and Mr. Sidney, at Mr. Sidney's\r\nfarm-house door.\r\n\r\n'And if there should be any poultry claims--' he went on.\r\n\r\n'There won't be,' said Midmore. 'It's too like cheating a sucking child,\r\nisn't it, Mr. Sidney?'\r\n\r\n'You've got me!' was all the reply. 'I be used to bein' put upon, but\r\nyou've got me, Mus' Midmore.'\r\n\r\nMidmore pointed to a new brick pig-pound built in strict disregard of\r\nthe terms of the life-tenant's lease. The gesture told the tale to the\r\nfew who did not know, and they shouted.\r\n\r\nSuch pagan delights as these were followed by pagan sloth of evenings\r\nwhen men and women elsewhere are at their brightest. But Midmore\r\npreferred to lie out on a yellow silk couch, reading works of a debasing\r\nvulgarity; or, by invitation, to dine with the Sperrits and savages of\r\ntheir kidney. These did not expect flights of fancy or phrasing. They\r\nlied, except about horses, grudgingly and of necessity, not for art's\r\nsake; and, men and women alike, they expressed themselves along their\r\nchosen lines with the serene indifference of the larger animals. Then\r\nMidmore would go home and identify them, one by one, out of the\r\nnatural-history books by Mr. Surtees, on the table beside the sofa. At\r\nfirst they looked upon him coolly, but when the tale of the removed wire\r\nand the recaptured gorse had gone the rounds, they accepted him for a\r\nperson willing to play their games. True, a faction suspended judgment\r\nfor a while, because they shot, and hoped that Midmore would serve the\r\nglorious mammon of pheasant-raising rather than the unkempt god of\r\nfox-hunting. But after he had shown his choice, they did not ask by what\r\nintellectual process he had arrived at it. He hunted three, sometimes\r\nfour, times a week, which necessitated not only one bay gelding (£94:\r\n10s.), but a mannerly white-stockinged chestnut (£114), and a black\r\nmare, rather long in the back but with a mouth of silk (£150), who so\r\nevidently preferred to carry a lady that it would have been cruel to\r\nhave baulked her. Besides, with that handling she could be sold at a\r\nprofit. And besides, the hunt was a quiet, intimate, kindly little hunt,\r\nnot anxious for strangers, of good report in the _Field_, the servant of\r\none M.F.H., given to hospitality, riding well its own horses, and, with\r\nthe exception of Midmore, not novices. But as Miss Sperrit observed,\r\nafter the M.F.H. had said some things to him at a gate: 'It _is_ a pity\r\nyou don't know as much as your horse, but you will in time. It takes\r\nyears and yee-ars. I've been at it for fifteen and I'm only just\r\nlearning. But you've made a decent kick-off.'\r\n\r\nSo he kicked off in wind and wet and mud, wondering quite sincerely why\r\nthe bubbling ditches and sucking pastures held him from day to day, or\r\nwhat so-lace he could find on off days in chasing grooms and\r\nbrick-layers round outhouses.\r\n\r\nTo make sure he up-rooted himself one week-end of heavy mid-winter rain,\r\nand re-entered his lost world in the character of Galahad fresh from a\r\nrest-cure. They all agreed, with an eye over his shoulder for the next\r\ncomer, that he was a different man; but when they asked him for the\r\nsymptoms of nervous strain, and led him all through their own, he\r\nrealised he had lost much of his old skill in lying. His three months'\r\nabsence, too, had put him hopelessly behind the London field. The\r\nmovements, the allusions, the slang of the game had changed. The couples\r\nhad rearranged themselves or were re-crystallizing in fresh triangles,\r\nwhereby he put his foot in it badly. Only one great soul (he who had\r\nwritten the account of the pig-pound episode) stood untouched by the\r\nvast flux of time, and Midmore lent him another fiver for his integrity.\r\nA woman took him, in the wet forenoon, to a pronouncement on the Oneness\r\nof Impulse in Humanity, which struck him as a polysyllabic _résumé_ of\r\nMr. Sidney's domestic arrangements, plus a clarion call to 'shock\r\ncivilisation into common-sense.'\r\n\r\n'And you'll come to tea with me to-morrow?' she asked, after lunch,\r\nnibbling cashew nuts from a saucer. Midmore replied that there were\r\ngreat arrears of work to overtake when a man had been put away for\r\nso long.\r\n\r\n'But you've come back like a giant refreshed.... I hope that\r\nDaphne'--this was the lady of the twelve and the eight-page\r\nletter--'will be with us too. She has misunderstood herself, like so\r\nmany of us,' the woman murmured, 'but I think eventually ...' she flung\r\nout her thin little hands. 'However, these are things that each lonely\r\nsoul must adjust for itself.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, yes,' said Midmore with a deep sigh. The old tricks were\r\nsprouting in the old atmosphere like mushrooms in a dung-pit. He passed\r\ninto an abrupt reverie, shook his head, as though stung by tumultuous\r\nmemories, and departed without any ceremony of farewell to--catch a\r\nmid-afternoon express where a man meets associates who talk horse, and\r\nweather as it affects the horse, all the way down. What worried him most\r\nwas that he had missed a day with the hounds.\r\n\r\nHe met Rhoda's keen old eyes without flinching; and the drawing-room\r\nlooked very comfortable that wet evening at tea. After all, his visit to\r\ntown had not been wholly a failure. He had burned quite a bushel of\r\nletters at his flat. A flat--here he reached mechanically towards the\r\nworn volumes near the sofa--a flat was a consuming animal. As for\r\nDaphne ... he opened at random on the words: 'His lordship then did as\r\ndesired and disclosed a _tableau_ of considerable strength and variety.'\r\nMidmore reflected: 'And I used to think.... But she wasn't.... We were\r\nall babblers and skirters together.... I didn't babble much--thank\r\ngoodness--but I skirted.' He turned the pages backward for more _Sortes\r\nSurteesianae_, and read: 'When at length they rose to go to bed it\r\nstruck each man as he followed his neighbour upstairs, that the man\r\nbefore him walked very crookedly.' He laughed aloud at the fire.\r\n\r\n'What about to-morrow?' Rhoda asked, entering with garments over her\r\nshoulder. 'It's never stopped raining since you left. You'll be\r\nplastered out of sight an' all in five minutes. You'd better wear your\r\nnext best, 'adn't you? I'm afraid they've shrank. 'Adn't you best\r\ntry 'em on?'\r\n\r\n'Here?' said Midmore.\r\n\r\n''Suit yourself. I bathed you when you wasn't larger than a leg o'\r\nlamb,' said the ex-ladies'-maid.\r\n\r\n'Rhoda, one of these days I shall get a valet, and a married butler.'\r\n\r\n'There's many a true word spoke in jest. But nobody's huntin'\r\nto-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'Why? Have they cancelled the meet?'\r\n\r\n'They say it only means slipping and over-reaching in the mud, and they\r\nall 'ad enough of that to-day. Charlie told me so just now.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!' It seemed that the word of Mr. Sperrit's confidential clerk had\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n'Charlie came down to help Mr. Sidney lift the gates,' Rhoda continued.\r\n\r\n'The floodgates? They are perfectly easy to handle now. I've put in a\r\nwheel and a winch.'\r\n\r\n'When the brook's really up they must be took clean out on account of\r\nthe rubbish blockin' 'em. That's why Charlie came down.'\r\n\r\nMidmore grunted impatiently. 'Everybody has talked to me about that\r\nbrook ever since I came here. It's never done anything yet.'\r\n\r\n'This 'as been a dry summer. If you care to look now, sir, I'll get you\r\na lantern.'\r\n\r\nShe paddled out with him into a large wet night. Half-way down the lawn\r\nher light was reflected on shallow brown water, pricked through with\r\ngrass blades at the edges. Beyond that light, the brook was strangling\r\nand kicking among hedges and tree-trunks.\r\n\r\n'What on earth will happen to the big rose-bed?' was Midmore's first\r\nword.\r\n\r\n'It generally 'as to be restocked after a flood. Ah!' she raised her\r\nlantern. 'There's two garden-seats knockin' against the sun-dial. Now,\r\nthat won't do the roses any good.'\r\n\r\n'This is too absurd. There ought to be some decently thought-out\r\nsystem--for--for dealing with this sort of thing.' He peered into the\r\nrushing gloom. There seemed to be no end to the moisture and the racket.\r\nIn town he had noticed nothing.\r\n\r\n'It can't be 'elped,' said Rhoda. 'It's just what it does do once in\r\njust so often. We'd better go back.'\r\n\r\nAll earth under foot was sliding in a thousand liquid noises towards\r\nthe hoarse brook. Somebody wailed from the house: ''Fraid o' the water!\r\nCome 'ere! 'Fraid o' the water!'\r\n\r\n'That's Jimmy. Wet always takes 'im that way,' she explained. The idiot\r\ncharged into them, shaking with terror.\r\n\r\n'Brave Jimmy! How brave of Jimmy! Come into the hall. What Jimmy got\r\nnow?' she crooned. It was a sodden note which ran: 'Dear Rhoda--Mr.\r\nLotten, with whom I rode home this afternoon, told me that if this wet\r\nkeeps up, he's afraid the fish-pond he built last year, where Coxen's\r\nold mill-dam was, will go, as the dam did once before, he says. If it\r\ndoes it's bound to come down the brook. It may be all right, but perhaps\r\nyou had better look out. C.S.'\r\n\r\n'If Coxen's dam goes, that means.... I'll 'ave the drawing-room carpet\r\nup at once to be on the safe side. The claw-'ammer is in the libery.'\r\n\r\n'Wait a minute. Sidney's gates are out, you said?'\r\n\r\n'Both. He'll need it if Coxen's pond goes.... I've seen it once.'\r\n\r\n'I'll just slip down and have a look at Sidney. Light the lantern again,\r\nplease, Rhoda.'\r\n\r\n'You won't get _him_ to stir. He's been there since he was born. But\r\n_she_ don't know anything. I'll fetch your waterproof and some\r\ntop-boots.'\r\n\r\n''Fraid o' the water! 'Fraid o' the water!' Jimmy sobbed, pressed\r\nagainst a corner of the hall, his hands to his eyes.\r\n\r\n'All right, Jimmy. Jimmy can help play with the carpet,' Rhoda\r\nanswered, as Midmore went forth into the darkness and the roarings all\r\nround. He had never seen such an utterly unregulated state of affairs.\r\nThere was another lantern reflected on the streaming drive.\r\n\r\n'Hi! Rhoda! Did you get my note? I came down to make sure. I thought,\r\nafterwards, Jimmy might funk the water!'\r\n\r\n'It's me--Miss Sperrit,' Midmore cried. 'Yes, we got it, thanks.'\r\n\r\n'You're back, then. Oh, good!... Is it bad down with you?'\r\n\r\n'I'm going to Sidney's to have a look.'\r\n\r\n'You won't get _him_ out. 'Lucky I met Bob Lotten. I told him he hadn't\r\nany business impounding water for his idiotic trout without\r\nrebuilding the dam.'\r\n\r\n'How far up is it? I've only been there once.'\r\n\r\n'Not more than four miles as the water will come. He says he's opened\r\nall the sluices.'\r\n\r\nShe had turned and fallen into step beside him, her hooded head bowed\r\nagainst the thinning rain. As usual she was humming to herself.\r\n\r\n'Why on earth did you come out in this weather?' Midmore asked.\r\n\r\n'It was worse when you were in town. The rain's taking off now. If it\r\nwasn't for that pond, I wouldn't worry so much. There's Sidney's bell.\r\nCome on!' She broke into a run. A cracked bell was jangling feebly down\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\n'Keep on the road!' Midmore shouted. The ditches were snorting\r\nbank-full on either side, and towards the brook-side the fields were\r\nafloat and beginning to move in the darkness.\r\n\r\n'Catch me going off it! There's his light burning all right.' She halted\r\nundistressed at a little rise. 'But the flood's in the orchard. Look!'\r\nShe swung her lantern to show a front rank of old apple-trees reflected\r\nin still, out-lying waters beyond the half-drowned hedge. They could\r\nhear above the thud-thud of the gorged floodgates, shrieks in two keys\r\nas monotonous as a steam-organ.\r\n\r\n'The high one's the pig.' Miss Sperrit laughed.\r\n\r\n'All right! I'll get _her_ out. You stay where you are, and I'll see you\r\nhome afterwards.'\r\n\r\n'But the water's only just over the road,' she objected.\r\n\r\n'Never mind. Don't you move. Promise?'\r\n\r\n'All right. You take my stick, then, and feel for holes in case\r\nanything's washed out anywhere. This _is_ a lark!'\r\n\r\nMidmore took it, and stepped into the water that moved sluggishly as yet\r\nacross the farm road which ran to Sidney's front door from the raised\r\nand metalled public road. It was half way up to his knees when he\r\nknocked. As he looked back Miss Sperrit's lantern seemed to float in\r\nmid-ocean.\r\n\r\n'You can't come in or the water'll come with you. I've bunged up all the\r\ncracks,' Mr. Sidney shouted from within. 'Who be ye?'\r\n\r\n'Take me out! Take me out!' the woman shrieked, and the pig from his\r\nsty behind the house urgently seconded the motion.\r\n\r\n'I'm Midmore! Coxen's old mill-dam is likely to go, they say. Come out!'\r\n\r\n'I told 'em it would when they made a fish-pond of it. 'Twasn't ever\r\npuddled proper. But it's a middlin' wide valley. She's got room to\r\nspread.... Keep still, or I'll take and duck you in the cellar!... You\r\ngo 'ome, Mus' Midmore, an' take the law o' Mus' Lotten soon's you've\r\nchanged your socks.'\r\n\r\n'Confound you, aren't you coming out?'\r\n\r\n'To catch my death o' cold? I'm all right where I be. I've seen it\r\nbefore. But you can take _her_. She's no sort o' use or sense.... Climb\r\nout through the window. Didn't I tell you I'd plugged the door-cracks,\r\nyou fool's daughter?' The parlour window opened, and the woman flung\r\nherself into Midmore's arms, nearly knocking him down. Mr. Sidney leaned\r\nout of the window, pipe in mouth.\r\n\r\n'Take her 'ome,' he said, and added oracularly:\r\n\r\n     'Two women in one house,\r\n     Two cats an' one mouse,\r\n     Two dogs an' one bone--\r\n     Which I will leave alone.\r\n\r\nI've seen it before.' Then he shut and fastened the window.\r\n\r\n'A trap! A trap! You had ought to have brought a trap for me. I'll be\r\ndrowned in this wet,' the woman cried.\r\n\r\n'Hold up! You can't be any wetter than you are. Come along!' Midmore\r\ndid not at all like the feel of the water over his boot-tops.\r\n\r\n'Hooray! Come along!' Miss Sperrit's lantern, not fifty yards away,\r\nwaved cheerily.\r\n\r\nThe woman threshed towards it like a panic-stricken goose, fell on her\r\nknees, was jerked up again by Midmore, and pushed on till she collapsed\r\nat Miss Sperrit's feet.\r\n\r\n'But you won't get bronchitis if you go straight to Mr. Midmore's\r\nhouse,' said the unsympathetic maiden.\r\n\r\n'O Gawd! O Gawd! I wish our 'eavenly Father 'ud forgive me my sins an'\r\ncall me 'ome,' the woman sobbed. 'But I won't go to _'is_ 'ouse!\r\nI won't.'\r\n\r\n'All right, then. Stay here. Now, if we run,' Miss Sperrit whispered to\r\nMidmore, 'she'll follow us. Not too fast!'\r\n\r\nThey set off at a considerable trot, and the woman lumbered behind them,\r\nbellowing, till they met a third lantern--Rhoda holding Jimmy's hand.\r\nShe had got the carpet up, she said, and was escorting Jimmy past the\r\nwater that he dreaded.\r\n\r\n'That's all right,' Miss Sperrit pronounced. 'Take Mrs. Sidney back with\r\nyou, Rhoda, and put her to bed. I'll take Jimmy with me. You aren't\r\nafraid of the water now, are you, Jimmy?'\r\n\r\n'Not afraid of anything now.' Jimmy reached for her hand. 'But get away\r\nfrom the water quick.'\r\n\r\n'I'm coming with you,' Midmore interrupted.\r\n\r\n'You most certainly are not. You're drenched. She threw you twice. Go\r\nhome and change. You may have to be out again all night. It's only\r\nhalf-past seven now. I'm perfectly safe.' She flung herself lightly over\r\na stile, and hurried uphill by the foot-path, out of reach of all but\r\nthe boasts of the flood below.\r\n\r\nRhoda, dead silent, herded Mrs. Sidney to the house.\r\n\r\n'You'll find your things laid out on the bed,' she said to Midmore as he\r\ncame up. I'll attend to--to this. _She's_ got nothing to cry for.'\r\n\r\nMidmore raced into dry kit, and raced uphill to be rewarded by the sight\r\nof the lantern just turning into the Sperrits' gate. He came back by way\r\nof Sidney's farm, where he saw the light twinkling across three acres of\r\nshining water, for the rain had ceased and the clouds were stripping\r\noverhead, though the brook was noisier than ever. Now there was only\r\nthat doubtful mill-pond to look after--that and his swirling world\r\nabandoned to himself alone.\r\n\r\n'We shall have to sit up for it,' said Rhoda after dinner. And as the\r\ndrawing-room commanded the best view of the rising flood, they watched\r\nit from there for a long time, while all the clocks of the house bore\r\nthem company.\r\n\r\n''Tisn't the water, it's the mud on the skirting-board after it goes\r\ndown that I mind,' Rhoda whispered. 'The last time Coxen's mill broke, I\r\nremember it came up to the second--no, third--step o' Mr.\r\nSidney's stairs.'\r\n\r\n'What did Sidney do about it?'\r\n\r\n'He made a notch on the step. 'E said it was a record. Just like 'im.'\r\n\r\n'It's up to the drive now,' said Midmore after another long wait. 'And\r\nthe rain stopped before eight, you know.'\r\n\r\n'Then Coxen's dam _'as_ broke, and that's the first of the flood-water.'\r\nShe stared out beside him. The water was rising in sudden pulses--an\r\ninch or two at a time, with great sweeps and lagoons and a sudden\r\nincrease of the brook's proper thunder.\r\n\r\n'You can't stand all the time. Take a chair,' Midmore said presently.\r\n\r\nRhoda looked back into the bare room. 'The carpet bein' up _does_ make a\r\ndifference. Thank you, sir, I _will_ 'ave a set-down.'\r\n\r\n''Right over the drive now,' said Midmore. He opened the window and\r\nleaned out. 'Is that wind up the valley, Rhoda?'\r\n\r\n'No, that's _it_! But I've seen it before.'\r\n\r\nThere was not so much a roar as the purposeful drive of a tide across a\r\njagged reef, which put down every other sound for twenty minutes. A wide\r\nsheet of water hurried up to the little terrace on which the house\r\nstood, pushed round either corner, rose again and stretched, as it were,\r\nyawning beneath the moonlight, joined other sheets waiting for them in\r\nunsuspected hollows, and lay out all in one. A puff of wind followed.\r\n\r\n'It's right up to the wall now. I can touch it with my finger.' Midmore\r\nbent over the window-sill.\r\n\r\n'I can 'ear it in the cellars,' said Rhoda dolefully. 'Well, we've done\r\nwhat we can! I think I'll 'ave a look.' She left the room and was absent\r\nhalf an hour or more, during which time he saw a full-grown tree\r\nhauling itself across the lawn by its naked roots. Then a hurdle knocked\r\nagainst the wall, caught on an iron foot-scraper just outside, and made\r\na square-headed ripple. The cascade through the cellar-windows\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\n'It's dropping,' Rhoda cried, as she returned. 'It's only tricklin' into\r\nmy cellars now.'\r\n\r\n'Wait a minute. I believe--I believe I can see the scraper on the edge\r\nof the drive just showing!'\r\n\r\nIn another ten minutes the drive itself roughened and became gravel\r\nagain, tilting all its water towards the shrubbery.\r\n\r\n'The pond's gone past,' Rhoda announced. 'We shall only 'ave the common\r\nflood to contend with now. You'd better go to bed.'\r\n\r\n'I ought to go down and have another look at Sidney before daylight.'\r\n\r\n'No need. You can see 'is light burnin' from all the upstairs windows.'\r\n\r\n'By the way. I forgot about _her_. Where've you put her?'\r\n\r\n'In my bed.' Rhoda's tone was ice. 'I wasn't going to undo a room for\r\n_that_ stuff.'\r\n\r\n'But it--it couldn't be helped,' said Midmore. 'She was half drowned.\r\nOne mustn't be narrow-minded, Rhoda, even if her position isn't\r\nquite--er--regular.'\r\n\r\n'Pfff! I wasn't worryin' about that.' She leaned forward to the window.\r\n'There's the edge of the lawn showin' now. It falls as fast as it rises.\r\nDearie'--the change of tone made Midmore jump--'didn't you know that I\r\nwas 'is first? _That's_ what makes it so hard to bear.' Midmore looked\r\nat the long lizard-like back and had no words.\r\n\r\nShe went on, still talking through the black window-pane:\r\n\r\n'Your pore dear auntie was very kind about it. She said she'd make all\r\nallowances for one, but no more. Never any more.... Then, you didn't\r\nknow 'oo Charlie was all this time?'\r\n\r\n'Your nephew, I always thought.'\r\n\r\n'Well, well,' she spoke pityingly. 'Everybody's business being nobody's\r\nbusiness, I suppose no one thought to tell you. But Charlie made 'is own\r\nway for 'imself from the beginnin'!... But _her_ upstairs, she never\r\nproduced anything. Just an 'ousekeeper, as you might say. 'Turned over\r\nan' went to sleep straight off. She 'ad the impudence to ask me for 'ot\r\nsherry-gruel.'\r\n\r\n'Did you give it to her,' said Midmore.\r\n\r\n'Me? Your sherry? No!'\r\n\r\nThe memory of Sidney's outrageous rhyme at the window, and Charlie's\r\nlong nose (he thought it looked interested at the time) as he passed the\r\ncopies of Mrs. Werf's last four wills, overcame Midmore without warning.\r\n\r\n'This damp is givin' you a cold,' said Rhoda, rising. 'There you go\r\nagain! Sneezin's a sure sign of it. Better go to bed. You can't do any\r\nthin' excep''--she stood rigid, with crossed arms--'about me.'\r\n\r\n'Well. What about you?' Midmore stuffed the handkerchief into his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n'Now you know about it, what are you goin' to do--sir?'\r\n\r\nShe had the answer on her lean cheek before the sentence was finished.\r\n\r\n'Go and see if you can get us something to eat, Rhoda. And beer.'\r\n\r\n'I expec' the larder'll be in a swim,' she replied, 'but old bottled\r\nstuff don't take any harm from wet.' She returned with a tray, all in\r\norder, and they ate and drank together, and took observations of the\r\nfalling flood till dawn opened its bleared eyes on the wreck of what had\r\nbeen a fair garden. Midmore, cold and annoyed, found himself humming:\r\n\r\n     'That flood strewed wrecks upon the grass,\r\n     That ebb swept out the flocks to sea.\r\n\r\nThere isn't a rose left, Rhoda!\r\n\r\n     An awesome ebb and flow it was\r\n     To many more than mine and me.\r\n     But each will mourn his ...\r\n\r\nIt'll cost me a hundred.'\r\n\r\n'Now we know the worst,' said Rhoda, 'we can go to bed. I'll lay on the\r\nkitchen sofa. His light's burnin' still.'\r\n\r\n'And _she_?'\r\n\r\n'Dirty old cat! You ought to 'ear 'er snore!'\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock in the morning, after a maddening hour in his own garden\r\non the edge of the retreating brook, Midmore went off to confront more\r\ndamage at Sidney's. The first thing that met him was the pig, snowy\r\nwhite, for the water had washed him out of his new sty, calling on high\r\nheaven for breakfast. The front door had been forced open, and the flood\r\nhad registered its own height in a brown dado on the walls. Midmore\r\nchased the pig out and called up the stairs.\r\n\r\n'I be abed o' course. Which step 'as she rose to?' Sidney cried from\r\nabove. 'The fourth? Then it's beat all records. Come up.'\r\n\r\n'Are you ill?' Midmore asked as he entered the room. The red eyelids\r\nblinked cheerfully. Mr. Sidney, beneath a sumptuous patch-work quilt,\r\nwas smoking.\r\n\r\n'Nah! I'm only thankin' God I ain't my own landlord. Take that cheer.\r\nWhat's she done?'\r\n\r\n'It hasn't gone down enough for me to make sure.'\r\n\r\n'Them floodgates o' yourn'll be middlin' far down the brook by now; an'\r\nyour rose-garden have gone after 'em. I saved my chickens, though. You'd\r\nbetter get Mus' Sperrit to take the law o' Lotten an' 'is fish-pond.'\r\n\r\n'No, thanks. I've trouble enough without that.'\r\n\r\n'Hev ye?' Mr. Sidney grinned. 'How did ye make out with those two women\r\no' mine last night? I lay they fought.'\r\n\r\n'You infernal old scoundrel!' Midmore laughed.\r\n\r\n'I be--an' then again I bain't,' was the placid answer. 'But, Rhoda,\r\n_she_ wouldn't ha' left me last night. Fire or flood, she wouldn't.'\r\n\r\n'Why didn't you ever marry her?' Midmore asked.\r\n\r\n'Waste of good money. She was willin' without.'\r\n\r\nThere was a step on the gritty mud below, and a voice humming. Midmore\r\nrose quickly saying: 'Well, I suppose you're all right now.'\r\n\r\n'I be. I ain't a landlord, nor I ain't young--nor anxious. Oh, Mus'\r\nMidmore! Would it make any odds about her thirty pounds comin' regular\r\nif I married her? Charlie said maybe 'twould.'\r\n\r\n'Did he?' Midmore turned at the door. 'And what did Jimmy say about it?'\r\n\r\n'Jimmy?' Mr. Sidney chuckled as the joke took him. 'Oh, _he's_ none o'\r\nmine. He's Charlie's look-out.'\r\n\r\nMidmore slammed the door and ran downstairs.\r\n\r\n'Well, this is a--sweet--mess,' said Miss Sperrit in shortest skirts and\r\nheaviest riding-boots. 'I had to come down and have a look at it. \"The\r\nold mayor climbed the belfry tower.\" 'Been up all night nursing\r\nyour family?'\r\n\r\n'Nearly that! Isn't it cheerful?' He pointed through the door to the\r\nstairs with small twig-drift on the last three treads.\r\n\r\n'It's a record, though,' said she, and hummed to herself:\r\n\r\n     'That flood strewed wrecks upon the grass,\r\n     That ebb swept out the flocks to sea.'\r\n\r\n'You're always singing that, aren't you?' Midmore said suddenly as she\r\npassed into the parlour where slimy chairs had been stranded at\r\nall angles.\r\n\r\n'Am I? Now I come to think of it I believe I do. They say I always hum\r\nwhen I ride. Have you noticed it?'\r\n\r\n'Of course I have. I notice every--'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' she went on hurriedly. 'We had it for the village cantata last\r\nwinter--\"The Brides of Enderby.\"'\r\n\r\n'No! \"High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire.\"' For some reason Midmore\r\nspoke sharply.\r\n\r\n'Just like that.' She pointed to the befouled walls. 'I say.... Let's\r\nget this furniture a little straight.... You know it too?'\r\n\r\n'Every word, since you sang it of course.'\r\n\r\n'When?'\r\n\r\n'The first night I ever came down. You rode past the drawing-room window\r\nin the dark singing it--\"And sweeter woman--\"'\r\n\r\n'I thought the house was empty then. Your aunt always let us use that\r\nshort cut. Ha-hadn't we better get this out into the passage? It'll all\r\nhave to come out anyhow. You take the other side.' They began to lift a\r\nheavyish table. Their words came jerkily between gasps and their faces\r\nwere as white as--a newly washed and very hungry pig.\r\n\r\n'Look out!' Midmore shouted. His legs were whirled from under him, as\r\nthe table, grunting madly, careened and knocked the girl out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe wild boar of Asia could not have cut down a couple more\r\nscientifically, but this little pig lacked his ancestor's nerve and fled\r\nshrieking over their bodies.\r\n\r\n'Are you hurt, darling?' was Midmore's first word, and 'No--I'm only\r\nwinded--dear,' was Miss Sperrit's, as he lifted her out of her corner,\r\nher hat over one eye and her right cheek a smear of mud.\r\n\r\nThey fed him a little later on some chicken-feed that they found in\r\nSidney's quiet barn, a pail of buttermilk out of the dairy, and a\r\nquantity of onions from a shelf in the back-kitchen.\r\n\r\n'Seed-onions, most likely,' said Connie. 'You'll hear about this.'\r\n\r\n'What does it matter? They ought to have been gilded. We must buy him.'\r\n\r\n'And keep him as long as he lives,' she agreed. 'But I think I ought to\r\ngo home now. You see, when I came out I didn't expect ... Did you?'\r\n\r\n'No! Yes.... It had to come.... But if any one had told me an hour\r\nago!... Sidney's unspeakable parlour--and the mud on the carpet.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I say! Is my cheek clean now?'\r\n\r\n'Not quite. Lend me your hanky again a minute, darling.... What a purler\r\nyou came!'\r\n\r\n'You can't talk. 'Remember when your chin hit that table and you said\r\n\"blast\"! I was just going to laugh.'\r\n\r\n'You didn't laugh when I picked you up. You were going \"oo-oo-oo\" like a\r\nlittle owl.'\r\n\r\n'My dear child--'\r\n\r\n'Say that again!'\r\n\r\n'My dear child. (Do you really like it? I keep it for my best friends.)\r\nMy _dee-ar_ child, I thought I was going to be sick there and then. He\r\nknocked every ounce of wind out of me--the angel! But I must really go.'\r\n\r\nThey set off together, very careful not to join hands or take arms.\r\n\r\n'Not across the fields,' said Midmore at the stile. 'Come round by--by\r\nyour own place.'\r\n\r\nShe flushed indignantly.\r\n\r\n'It will be yours in a little time,' he went on, shaken with his own\r\naudacity.\r\n\r\n'Not so much of your little times, if you please!' She shied like a colt\r\nacross the road; then instantly, like a colt, her eyes lit with new\r\ncuriosity as she came in sight of the drive-gates.\r\n\r\n'And not quite so much of your airs and graces, Madam,' Midmore\r\nreturned, 'or I won't let you use our drive as a short cut any more.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I'll be good. I'll be good.' Her voice changed suddenly. 'I swear\r\nI'll try to be good, dear. I'm not much of a thing at the best. What\r\nmade _you_....'\r\n\r\n'I'm worse--worse! Miles and oceans worse. But what does it matter now?'\r\n\r\nThey halted beside the gate-pillars.\r\n\r\n'I see!' she said, looking up the sodden carriage sweep to the front\r\ndoor porch where Rhoda was slapping a wet mat to and fro. '_I_ see....\r\nNow, I really must go home. No! Don't you come. I must speak to Mother\r\nfirst all by myself.'\r\n\r\nHe watched her up the hill till she was out of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE FLOODS\r\n\r\n     The rain it rains without a stay\r\n       In the hills above us, in the hills;\r\n     And presently the floods break way\r\n       Whose strength is in the hills.\r\n     The trees they suck from every cloud,\r\n     The valley brooks they roar aloud--\r\n     Bank-high for the lowlands, lowlands,\r\n       Lowlands under the hills!\r\n\r\n     The first wood down is sere and small,\r\n       From the hills, the brishings off the hills;\r\n     And then come by the bats and all\r\n       We cut last year in the hills;\r\n     And then the roots we tried to cleave\r\n     But found too tough and had to leave--\r\n     Polting through the lowlands, lowlands,\r\n       Lowlands under the hills!\r\n\r\n     The eye shall look, the ear shall hark\r\n       To the hills, the doings in the hills,\r\n     And rivers mating in the dark\r\n       With tokens from the hills.\r\n     Now what is weak will surely go,\r\n     And what is strong must prove it so.\r\n     Stand fast in the lowlands, lowlands,\r\n       Lowlands under the hills!\r\n\r\n     The floods they shall not be afraid--\r\n       Nor the hills above 'em, nor the hills--\r\n     Of any fence which man has made\r\n       Betwixt him and the hills.\r\n     The waters shall not reckon twice\r\n     For any work of man's device,\r\n     But bid it down to the lowlands, lowlands,\r\n       Lowlands under the hills!\r\n\r\n     The floods shall sweep corruption clean--\r\n       By the hills, the blessing of the hills--\r\n     That more the meadows may be green\r\n       New-amended from the hills.\r\n     The crops and cattle shall increase,\r\n     Nor little children shall not cease--\r\n     Go--plough the lowlands, lowlands,\r\n       Lowlands under the hills!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE FABULISTS\r\n\r\n     When all the world would have a matter hid,\r\n       Since Truth is seldom friend to any crowd,\r\n     Men write in fable, as old Æsop did,\r\n       Jesting at that which none will name aloud.\r\n     And this they needs must do, or it will fall\r\n     Unless they please they are not heard at all.\r\n\r\n     When desperate Folly daily laboureth\r\n       To work confusion upon all we have,\r\n     When diligent Sloth demandeth Freedom's death,\r\n       And banded Fear commandeth Honour's grave--\r\n     Even in that certain hour before the fall\r\n     Unless men please they are not heard at all.\r\n\r\n     Needs must all please, yet some not all for need\r\n       Needs must all toil, yet some not all for gain,\r\n     But that men taking pleasure may take heed,\r\n       Whom present toil shall snatch from later pain.\r\n     Thus some have toiled but their reward was small\r\n     Since, though they pleased, they were not heard at all.\r\n\r\n     This was the lock that lay upon our lips,\r\n       This was the yoke that we have undergone,\r\n     Denying us all pleasant fellowships\r\n       As in our time and generation.\r\n     Our pleasures unpursued age past recall.\r\n     And for our pains--we are not heard at all.\r\n\r\n     What man hears aught except the groaning guns?\r\n       What man heeds aught save what each instant brings?\r\n     When each man's life all imaged life outruns,\r\n       What man shall pleasure in imaginings?\r\n     So it hath fallen, as it was bound to fall,\r\n       We are not, nor we were not, heard at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vortex\r\n\r\n(August 1914)\r\n\r\n     'Thy Lord spoke by inspiration to the Bee.'\r\n\r\n     AL KORAN.\r\n\r\nI have, to my grief and loss, suppressed several notable stories of my\r\nfriend, the Hon.

Penfentenyou[8], once Minister of Woods and\r\nWaysides in De Thouar's first administration; later, Premier in all but\r\nname of one of Our great and growing Dominions; and now, as always, the\r\nidol of his own Province, which is two and one-half the size of England.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See 'The Puzzler,' _Actions and Reactions_.]\r\n\r\nFor this reason I hold myself at liberty to deal with some portion of\r\nthe truth concerning Penfentenyou's latest visit to Our shores. He\r\narrived at my house by car, on a hot summer day, in a white waistcoat\r\nand spats, sweeping black frock-coat and glistening top-hat--a little\r\nrounded, perhaps, at the edges, but agile as ever in mind and body.\r\n\r\n'What is the trouble now?' I asked, for the last time we had met,\r\nPenfentenyou was floating a three-million pound loan for his beloved but\r\nunscrupulous Province, and I did not wish to entertain any more of his\r\nfinancial friends.\r\n\r\n'We,' Penfentenyou replied ambassadorially, 'have come to have a Voice\r\nin Your Councils. By the way, the Voice is coming down on the evening\r\ntrain with my Agent-General. I thought you wouldn't mind if I invited\r\n'em. You know We're going to share Your burdens henceforward. You'd\r\nbetter get into training.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly,' I replied. 'What's the Voice like?'\r\n\r\n'He's in earnest,' said Penfentenyou. 'He's got It, and he's got It bad.\r\nHe'll give It to you,' he said.\r\n\r\n'What's his name?'\r\n\r\n'We call him all sorts of names, but I think you'd better call him Mr.\r\nLingnam. You won't have to do it more than once.'\r\n\r\n'What's he suffering from?'\r\n\r\n'The Empire. He's pretty nearly cured us all of Imperialism at home.\r\nP'raps he'll cure you.'\r\n\r\n'Very good. What am I to do with him?'\r\n\r\n'Don't you worry,' said Penfentenyou. 'He'll do it.'\r\n\r\nAnd when Mr. Lingnam appeared half-an-hour later with the Agent-General\r\nfor Penfentenyou's Dominion, he did just that.\r\n\r\nHe advanced across the lawn eloquent as all the tides. He said he had\r\nbeen observing to the Agent-General that it was both politically immoral\r\nand strategically unsound that forty-four million people should bear the\r\nentire weight of the defences of Our mighty Empire, but, as he had\r\nobserved (here the Agent-General evaporated), we stood now upon the\r\nthreshold of a new era in which the self-governing _and_ self-respecting\r\n(bis) Dominions would rightly and righteously, as co-partners in Empery,\r\nshoulder their share of any burden which the Pan-Imperial Council of\r\nthe Future should allot. The Agent-General was already arranging for\r\ndrinks with Penfentenyou at the other end of the garden. Mr. Lingnam\r\nswept me on to the most remote bench and settled to his theme.\r\n\r\nWe dined at eight. At nine Mr. Lingnam was only drawing abreast of\r\nthings Imperial. At ten the Agent-General, who earns his salary, was\r\nshamelessly dozing on the sofa. At eleven he and Penfentenyou went to\r\nbed. At midnight Mr. Lingnam brought down his big-bellied despatch box\r\nwith the newspaper clippings and set to federating the Empire in\r\nearnest. I remember that he had three alternative plans. As a dealer in\r\nwords, I plumped for the resonant third--'Reciprocally co-ordinated\r\nSenatorial Hegemony'--which he then elaborated in detail for\r\nthree-quarters of an hour. At half-past one he urged me to have faith\r\nand to remember that nothing mattered except the Idea. Then he retired\r\nto his room, accompanied by one glass of cold water, and I went into the\r\ndawn-lit garden and prayed to any Power that might be off duty for the\r\nblood of Mr. Lingnam, Penfentenyou, and the Agent-General.\r\n\r\nTo me, as I have often observed elsewhere, the hour of earliest dawn is\r\nfortunate, and the wind that runs before it has ever been my most\r\ncomfortable counsellor.\r\n\r\n'Wait!' it said, all among the night's expectant rosebuds. 'To-morrow is\r\nalso a day. Wait upon the Event!'\r\n\r\nI went to bed so at peace with God and Man and Guest that when I waked I\r\nvisited Mr. Lingnam in pyjamas, and he talked to me Pan-Imperially for\r\nhalf-an-hour before his bath. Later, the Agent-General said he had\r\nletters to write, and Penfentenyou invented a Cabinet crisis in his\r\nadored Dominion which would keep him busy with codes and cables all the\r\nforenoon. But I said firmly, 'Mr. Lingnam wishes to see a little of the\r\ncountry round here. You are coming with us in your own car.'\r\n\r\n'It's a hired one,' Penfentenyou objected.\r\n\r\n'Yes. Paid for by me as a taxpayer,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'And yours has a top, and the weather looks thundery,' said the\r\nAgent-General. 'Ours hasn't a wind-screen. Even our goggles were hired.'\r\n\r\n'I'll lend you goggles,' I said. 'My car is under repairs.'\r\n\r\nThe hireling who had looked to be returned to London spat and growled on\r\nthe drive. She was an open car, capable of some eighteen miles on the\r\nflat, with tetanic gears and a perpetual palsy.\r\n\r\n'It won't make the least difference,' sighed the Agent-General. 'He'll\r\nonly raise his voice. He did it all the way coming down.'\r\n\r\n'I say,' said Penfentenyou suspiciously, 'what are you doing all this\r\n_for_?'\r\n\r\n'Love of the Empire,' I answered, as Mr. Lingnam tripped up in dust-coat\r\nand binoculars. 'Now, Mr. Lingnam will tell us exactly what he wants to\r\nsee. He probably knows more about England than the rest of us put\r\ntogether.'\r\n\r\n'I read it up yesterday,' said Mr. Lingnam simply. While we stowed the\r\nlunch-basket (one can never make too sure with a hired car) he outlined\r\na very pretty and instructive little day's run.\r\n\r\n'You'll drive, of course?' said Penfentenyou to him. 'It's the only\r\nthing you know anything about.'\r\n\r\nThis astonished me, for your greater Federationists are rarely\r\nmechanicians, but Mr. Lingnam said he would prefer to be inside for the\r\npresent and enjoy our conversation.\r\n\r\nWell settled on the back seat, he did not once lift his eyes to the\r\nmellow landscape around him, or throw a word at the life of the English\r\nroad which to me is one renewed and unreasoned orgy of delight. The\r\nmustard-coloured scouts of the Automobile Association; their natural\r\nenemies, the unjust police; our natural enemies, the deliberate\r\nmarket-day cattle, broadside-on at all corners, the bicycling\r\nbutcher-boy a furlong behind; road-engines that pulled giddy-go-rounds,\r\nrifle galleries, and swings, and sucked snortingly from wayside ponds in\r\ndefiance of the notice-board; traction-engines, their trailers piled\r\nhigh with road metal; uniformed village nurses, one per seven statute\r\nmiles, flitting by on their wheels; governess-carts full of pink\r\nchildren jogging unconcernedly past roaring, brazen touring-cars; the\r\nwayside rector with virgins in attendance, their faces screwed up\r\nagainst our dust; motor-bicycles of every shape charging down at every\r\nangle; red flags of rifle-ranges; detachments of dusty-putteed\r\nTerritorials; coveys of flagrant children playing in mid-street, and the\r\nwise, educated English dog safe and quite silent on the pavement if his\r\nfool-mistress would but cease from trying to save him, passed and\r\nrepassed us in sunlit or shaded settings. But Mr. Lingnam only talked.\r\nHe talked--we all sat together behind so that we could not escape\r\nhim--and he talked above the worn gears and a certain maddening swish of\r\none badly patched tire--_and_ he talked of the Federation of the Empire\r\nagainst all conceivable dangers except himself. Yet I was neither\r\nbrutally rude like Penfentenyou, nor swooningly bored like the\r\nAgent-General. I remembered a certain Joseph Finsbury who delighted the\r\nTregonwell Arms on the borders of the New Forest with nine'--it should\r\nhave been ten--'versions of a single income of two hundred pounds'\r\nplacing the imaginary person in--but I could not recall the list of\r\ntowns further than 'London, Paris, Bagdad, and Spitsbergen.' This last I\r\nmust have murmured aloud, for the Agent-General suddenly became human\r\nand went on: 'Bussorah, Heligoland, and the Scilly Islands--'\r\n\r\n'What?' growled Penfentenyou.\r\n\r\n'Nothing,' said the Agent-General, squeezing my hand affectionately.\r\n'Only we have just found out that we are brothers.'\r\n\r\n'Exactly,' said Mr. Lingnam. 'That's what I've been trying to lead up\r\nto. We're _all_ brothers. D'you realise that fifteen years ago such a\r\nconversation as we're having would have been unthinkable? The Empire\r\nwouldn't have been ripe for it. To go back, even ten years--'\r\n\r\n'I've got it,' cried the Agent-General. '\"Brighton, Cincinnati, and\r\nNijni-Novgorod!\" God bless R.L.S.! Go on, Uncle Joseph. I can endure\r\nmuch now.'\r\n\r\nMr. Lingnam went on like our shandrydan, slowly and loudly. He admitted\r\nthat a man obsessed with a Central Idea--and, after all, the only thing\r\nthat mattered was the Idea--might become a bore, but the World's Work,\r\nhe pointed out, had been done by bores. So he laid his bones down to\r\nthat work till we abandoned ourselves to the passage of time and the\r\nMercy of Allah, Who Alone closes the Mouths of His Prophets. And we\r\nwasted more than fifty miles of summer's vivid own England upon him\r\nthe while.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock we topped Sumtner Rising and looked down on the\r\nvillage of Sumtner Barton, which lies just across a single railway line,\r\nspanned by a red brick bridge. The thick, thunderous June airs brought\r\nus gusts of melody from a giddy-go-round steam-organ in full blast near\r\nthe pond on the village green. Drums, too, thumped and banners waved and\r\nregalia flashed at the far end of the broad village street. Mr. Lingnam\r\nasked why.\r\n\r\n'Nothing Imperial, I'm afraid. It looks like a Foresters' Fête--one of\r\nour big Mutual Benefit Societies,' I explained.\r\n\r\n'The Idea only needs to be co-ordinated to Imperial scale--' he began.\r\n\r\n'But it means that the pub. will be crowded,' I went on.\r\n\r\n'What's the matter with lunching by the roadside here?' said\r\nPenfentenyou. 'We've got the lunch-basket.'\r\n\r\n'Haven't you ever heard of Sumtner Barton ales?' I demanded, and be\r\nbecame the administrator at once, saying, '_I_ see! Lingnam can drive us\r\nin and we'll get some, while Holford'--this was the hireling chauffeur,\r\nwhose views on beer we knew not--'lays out lunch here. That'll be better\r\nthan eating at the pub. We can take in the Foresters' Fête as well, and\r\nperhaps I can buy some newspapers at the station.'\r\n\r\n'True,' I answered. 'The railway station is just under that bridge, and\r\nwe'll come back and lunch here.'\r\n\r\nI indicated a terrace of cool clean shade beneath kindly beeches at the\r\nhead of Sumtner Rise. As Holford got out the lunch-basket, a detachment\r\nof Regular troops on manoeuvres swung down the baking road.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said Mr. Lingnam, the monthly-magazine roll in his voice. 'All\r\nEurope is an armed camp, groaning, as I remember I once wrote, under the\r\nweight of its accoutrements.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, hop in and drive,' cried Penfentenyou. 'We want that beer!'\r\n\r\nIt made no difference. Mr. Lingnam could have federated the Empire from\r\na tight rope. He continued his oration at the wheel as we trundled.\r\n\r\n'The danger to the Younger Nations is of being drawn into this vortex of\r\nMilitarism,' he went on, dodging the rear of the soldiery.\r\n\r\n'Slow past troops,' I hinted. 'It saves 'em dust. And we overtake on the\r\nright as a rule in England.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks!' Mr. Lingnam slued over. 'That's another detail which needs to\r\nbe co-ordinated throughout the Empire. But to go back to what I was\r\nsaying. My idea has always been that the component parts of the Empire\r\nshould take counsel among themselves on the approach of war, so that,\r\nafter we have decided on the merits of the _casus belli_, we can\r\nco-ordinate what part each Dominion shall play whenever war is,\r\nunfortunately, a possibility.'\r\n\r\nWe neared the hog-back railway bridge, and the hireling knocked\r\npiteously at the grade. Mr. Lingnam changed gears, and she hoisted\r\nherself up to a joyous _Youp-i-addy-i-ay!_ from the steam-organ. As we\r\ntopped the arch we saw a Foresters' band with banners marching down\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n'That's all very fine,' said the Agent-General, 'but in real life things\r\nhave a knack of happening without approaching--'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(Some schools of Thought hold that Time is not; and that when we attain\r\ncomplete enlightenment we shall behold past, present, and future as One\r\nAwful Whole. I myself have nearly achieved this.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe dipped over the bridge into the village. A boy on a bicycle, loaded\r\nwith four paper bonnet-boxes, pedalled towards us, out of an alley on\r\nour right. He bowed his head the better to overcome the ascent, and\r\nnaturally took his left. Mr. Lingnam swerved frantically to the right.\r\nPenfentenyou shouted. The boy looked up, saw the car was like to squeeze\r\nhim against the bridge wall, flung himself off his machine and across\r\nthe narrow pavement into the nearest house. He slammed the door at the\r\nprecise moment when the car, all brakes set, bunted the abandoned\r\nbicycle, shattering three of the bonnet-boxes and jerking the fourth\r\nover the unscreened dashboard into Mr. Lingnam's arms.\r\n\r\nThere was a dead stillness, then a hiss like that of escaping steam, and\r\na man who had been running towards us ran the other way.\r\n\r\n'Why! I think that those must be bees,' said Mr. Lingnam.\r\n\r\nThey were--four full swarms--and the first living objects which he had\r\nremarked upon all day.\r\n\r\nSome one said, 'Oh, God!' The Agent-General went out over the back of\r\nthe car, crying resolutely: 'Stop the traffic! Stop the traffic, there!'\r\nPenfentenyou was already on the pavement ringing a door-bell, so I had\r\nboth their rugs, which--for I am an apiarist--I threw over my head.\r\nWhile I was tucking my trousers into my socks--for I am an apiarist of\r\nexperience--Mr. Lingnam picked up the unexploded bonnet-box and with a\r\nsingle magnificent gesture (he told us afterwards he thought there was a\r\nriver beneath) hurled it over the parapet of the bridge, ere he ran\r\nacross the road towards the village green. Now, the station platform\r\nimmediately below was crowded with Foresters and their friends waiting\r\nto welcome a delegation from a sister Court. I saw the box burst on the\r\nflint edging of the station garden and the contents sweep forward\r\ncone-wise like shrapnel. But the result was stimulating rather than\r\nsedative. All those well-dressed people below shouted like Sodom and\r\nGomorrah. Then they moved as a unit into the booking-office, the\r\nwaiting-rooms, and other places, shut doors and windows and declaimed\r\naloud, while the incoming train whistled far down the line.\r\n\r\nI pivoted round cross-legged on the back seat, like a Circassian beauty\r\nbeneath her veil, and saw Penfentenyou, his coat-collar over his ears,\r\ndancing before a shut door and holding up handfuls of currency to a\r\nsilver-haired woman at an upper window, who only mouthed and shook her\r\nhead. A little child, carrying a kitten, came smiling round a corner.\r\nSuddenly (but these things moved me no more than so many yards of\r\nthree-penny cinematograph-film) the kitten leaped spitting from her\r\narms, the child burst into tears, Penfentenyou, still dancing, snatched\r\nher up and tucked her under his coat, the woman's countenance blanched,\r\nthe front door opened, Penfentenyou and the child pressed through, and I\r\nwas alone in an inhospitable world where every one was shutting windows\r\nand calling children home.\r\n\r\nA voice cried: 'You've frowtened 'em! You've frowtened 'em! Throw dust\r\non 'em and they'll settle!'\r\n\r\nI did not desire to throw dust on any created thing. I needed both hands\r\nfor my draperies and two more for my stockings. Besides, the bees were\r\ndoing me no hurt. They recognised me as a member of the County\r\nBee-keepers' Association who had paid his annual subscription and was\r\nentitled to a free seat at all apicultural exhibitions. The quiver and\r\nthe churn of the hireling car, or it might have been the lurching\r\nbanners and the arrogant big drum, inclined many of them to go up\r\nstreet, and pay court to the advancing Foresters' band. So they went,\r\nsuch as had not followed Mr. Lingnam in his flight toward the green, and\r\nI looked out of two goggled eyes instead of half a one at the\r\napproaching musicians, while I listened with both ears to the delayed\r\ntrain's second whistle down the line beneath me.\r\n\r\nThe Forester's band no more knew what was coming than do troops under\r\nsudden fire. Indeed, there were the same extravagant gestures and\r\ncontortions as attend wounds and deaths in war; the very same uncanny\r\ncessations of speech--for the trombone was cut off at midslide, even as\r\na man drops with a syllable on his tongue. They clawed, they slapped,\r\nthey fled, leaving behind them a trophy of banners and brasses crudely\r\narranged round the big drum. Then that end of the street also shut its\r\nwindows, and the village, stripped of life, lay round me like a reef at\r\nlow tide. Though I am, as I have said, an apiarist in good standing, I\r\nnever realised that there were so many bees in the world. When they had\r\nwoven a flashing haze from one end of the desert street to the other,\r\nthere remained reserves enough to form knops and pendules on all\r\nwindow-sills and gutter-ends, without diminishing the multitudes in the\r\nthree oozing bonnet-boxes, or drawing on the Fourth (Railway) Battalion\r\nin charge of the station below. The prisoners in the waiting-rooms and\r\nother places there cried out a great deal (I argued that they were dying\r\nof the heat), and at regular intervals the stationmaster called and\r\ncalled to a signalman who was not on duty, and the train whistled as it\r\ndrew nearer.\r\n\r\nThen Penfentenyou, venal and adaptable politician of the type that\r\nsurvives at the price of all the higher emotions, appeared at the window\r\nof the house on my right, broken and congested with mirth, the woman\r\nbeside him, and the child in his arms. I saw his mouth open and shut, he\r\nhollowed his hands round it, but the churr of the motor and the bees\r\ndrowned his words. He pointed dramatically across the street many times\r\nand fell back, tears running down his face. I turned like a hooded\r\nbarbette in a heavy seaway (not knowing when my trousers would come out\r\nof my socks again) through one hundred and eighty degrees, and in due\r\ntime bore on the village green. There was a salmon in the pond, rising\r\nshort at a cloud of midges to the tune of _Yip-i-addy_; but there was\r\nnone to gaff him. The swing-boats were empty, cocoa-nuts sat still on\r\ntheir red sticks before white screens, and the gay-painted horses of the\r\ngiddy-go-rounds revolved riderless. All was melody, green turf, bright\r\nwater, and this greedy gambolling fish. When I had identified it by its\r\ngrey gills and binoculars as Lingnam, I prostrated myself before Allah\r\nin that mirth which is more truly labour than any prayer. Then I turned\r\nto the purple Penfentenyou at the window, and wiped my eyes on the\r\nrug edge.\r\n\r\nHe raised the window half one cautious inch and bellowed through the\r\ncrack: 'Did you see _him_? Have they got _you_? I can see lots of\r\nthings from here. It's like a three-ring circus!'\r\n\r\n'Can you see the station?' I replied, nodding toward the right rear\r\nmudguard.\r\n\r\nHe twisted and craned sideways, but could not command that beautiful\r\nview.\r\n\r\n'No! What's it like?' he cried.\r\n\r\n'Hell!' I shouted. The silver-haired woman frowned; so did Penfentenyou,\r\nand, I think, apologised to her for my language.\r\n\r\n'You're always so extreme,' he fluted reproachfully. 'You forget that\r\nnothing matters except the Idea. Besides, they are this lady's bees.'\r\n\r\nHe closed the window, and introduced us through it in dumb show; but he\r\ncontrived to give the impression that _I_ was the specimen under glass.\r\n\r\nA spurt of damp steam saved me from apoplexy. The train had lost\r\npatience at last, and was coming into the station directly beneath me to\r\nsee what was the matter. Happy voices sang and heads were thrust out all\r\nalong the compartments, but none answered their songs or greetings. She\r\nhalted, and the people began to get out. Then they began to get in\r\nagain, as their friends in the waiting-rooms advised. All did not catch\r\nthe warning, so there was congestion at the doors, but those whom the\r\nbees caught got in first.\r\n\r\nStill the bees, more bent on their own business than wanton torture,\r\nkept to the south end of the platform by the bookstall, and that was why\r\nthe completely exposed engine-driver at the north end of the train did\r\nnot at first understand the hermetically sealed stationmaster when the\r\nlatter shouted to him many times to 'get on out o' this.'\r\n\r\n'Where are you?' was the reply. 'And what for?'\r\n\r\n'It don't matter where I am, an' you'll get what-for in a minute if you\r\ndon't shift,' said the stationmaster. 'Drop 'em at Parson's Meadow and\r\nthey can walk up over the fields.'\r\n\r\nThat bare-armed, thin-shirted idiot, leaning out of the cab, took the\r\nstationmaster's orders as an insult to his dignity, and roared at the\r\nshut offices: 'You'll give me what-for, will you? Look 'ere, I'm not in\r\nthe 'abit of--' His outstretched hand flew to his neck.... Do you know\r\nthat if you sting an engine-driver it is the same as stinging his train?\r\nShe starts with a jerk that nearly smashes the couplings, and runs,\r\nbarking like a dog, till she is out of sight. Nor does she think about\r\nspilled people and parted families on the platform behind her. I had to\r\ndo all that. There was a man called Fred, and his wife Harriet--a\r\ncheery, full-blooded couple--who interested me immensely before they\r\nbattered their way into a small detached building, already densely\r\noccupied. There was also a nameless bachelor who sat under a half-opened\r\numbrella and twirled it dizzily, which was so new a game that I\r\napplauded aloud.\r\n\r\nWhen they had thoroughly cleared the ground, the bees set about making\r\ncomb for publication at the bookstall counter. Presently some bold\r\nhearts tiptoed out of the waiting-rooms over the loud gravel with the\r\nconsciously modest air of men leaving church, climbed the wooden\r\nstaircase to the bridge, and so reached my level, where the\r\ninexhaustible bonnet-boxes were still vomiting squadrons and platoons.\r\nThere was little need to bid them descend. They had wrapped their heads\r\nin handkerchiefs, so that they looked like the disappointed dead\r\nscuttling back to Purgatory. Only one old gentleman, pontifically draped\r\nin a banner embroidered 'Temperance and Fortitude,' ran the gauntlet\r\nup-street, shouting as he passed me, 'It's night or Blücher, Mister.'\r\nThey let him in at the White Hart, the pub. where I should have\r\nbought the beer.\r\n\r\nAfter this the day sagged. I fell to reckoning how long a man in a\r\nTurkish bath, weakened by excessive laughter, could live without food,\r\nand specially drink; and how long a disenfranchised bee could hold out\r\nunder the same conditions.\r\n\r\nObviously, since her one practical joke costs her her life, the bee can\r\nhave but small sense of humour; but her fundamentally dismal and\r\nungracious outlook on life impressed me beyond words. She had paralysed\r\nlocomotion, wiped out trade, social intercourse, mutual trust, love,\r\nfriendship, sport, music (the lonely steam-organ had run down at last),\r\nall that gives substance, colour or savour to life, and yet, in the\r\nbarren desert she had created, was not one whit more near to the\r\nevolution of a saner order of things. The Heavens were darkened with the\r\nswarms' divided counsels; the street shimmered with their purposeless\r\nsallies. They clotted on tiles and gutter-pipes, and began frenziedly to\r\nbuild a cell or two of comb ere they discovered that their queen was\r\nnot with them; then flung off to seek her, or whirled, dishevelled and\r\ninsane, into another hissing nebula on the false rumour that she was\r\nthere. I scowled upon them with disfavour, and a massy, blue\r\nthunder-head rose majestically from behind the elm-trees of Sumtner\r\nBarton Rectory, arched over and scowled with me. Then I realised that it\r\nwas not bees nor locusts that had darkened the skies, but the on-coming\r\nof the malignant English thunderstorm--the one thing before which even\r\nDeborah the bee cannot express her silly little self.\r\n\r\n'Aha! _Now_ you'll catch it,' I said, as the herald gusts set the big\r\ndrum rolling down the street like a box-kite. Up and up yearned the dark\r\ncloud, till the first lightning quivered and cut. Deborah cowered. Where\r\nshe flew, there she fled; where she was, there she sat still; and the\r\nsolid rain closed in on her as a book that is closed when the chapter is\r\nfinished. By the time it had soaked to my second rug, Penfentenyou\r\nappeared at the window, wiping his false mouth on a napkin.\r\n\r\n'Are you all right?' he inquired. 'Then _that's_ all right! Mrs. Bellamy\r\nsays that her bees don't sting in the wet. You'd better fetch Lingnam\r\nover. He's got to pay for them and the bicycle.'\r\n\r\nI had no words which the silver-haired lady could listen to, but paddled\r\nacross the flooded street between flashes to the pond on the green. Mr.\r\nLingnam, scarcely visible through the sheeting downpour, trotted round\r\nthe edge. He bore himself nobly, and lied at the mere sight of me.\r\n\r\n'Isn't this wet?' he cried. 'It has drenched me to the skin. I shall\r\nneed a change.'\r\n\r\n'Come along,' I said. 'I don't know what you'll get, but you deserve\r\nmore.'\r\n\r\nPenfentenyou, dry, fed, and in command, let us in. 'You,' he whispered\r\nto me, 'are to wait in the scullery. Mrs. Bellamy didn't like the way\r\nyou talked about her bees. Hsh! Hsh! She's a kind-hearted lady. She's a\r\nwidow, Lingnam, but she's kept _his_ clothes, and as soon as you've paid\r\nfor the damage she'll rent you a suit. I've arranged it all!'\r\n\r\n'Then tell him he mustn't undress in my hall,' said a voice from the\r\nstair-head.\r\n\r\n'Tell _her_--' Lingnam began.\r\n\r\n'Come and look at the pretty suit I've chosen,' Penfentenyou cooed, as\r\none cajoling a maniac.\r\n\r\nI staggered out-of-doors again, and fell into the car, whose\r\never-running machinery masked my yelps and hiccups. When I raised my\r\nforehead from the wheel, I saw that traffic through the village had been\r\nresumed, after, as my watch showed, one and one-half hour's suspension.\r\nThere were two limousines, one landau, one doctor's car, three\r\ntouring-cars, one patent steam-laundry van, three tricars, one\r\ntraction-engine, some motor-cycles, one with a side-car, and one brewery\r\nlorry. It was the allegory of my own imperturbable country, delayed for\r\na short time by unforeseen external events but now going about her\r\nbusiness, and I blessed Her with tears in my eyes, even though I knew\r\nShe looked upon me as drunk and incapable.\r\n\r\nThen troops came over the bridge behind me--a company of dripping wet\r\nRegulars without any expression. In their rear, carrying the\r\nlunch-basket, marched the Agent-General and Holford the hired chauffeur.\r\n\r\n'I say,' said the Agent-General, nodding at the darkened khaki backs.\r\n'If _that's_ what we've got to depend on in event of war they're a\r\nbroken reed. They ran like hares--ran like hares, I tell you.'\r\n\r\n'And you?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I just sauntered back over the bridge and stopped the traffic that\r\nend. Then I had lunch. 'Pity about the beer, though. I say--these\r\ncushions are sopping wet!'\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry,' I said. 'I haven't had time to turn 'em.'\r\n\r\n'Nor there wasn't any need to 'ave kept the engine runnin' all this\r\ntime,' said Holford sternly. 'I'll 'ave to account for the expenditure\r\nof petrol. It exceeds the mileage indicated, you see.'\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry,' I repeated. After all, that is the way that taxpayers\r\nregard most crises.\r\n\r\nThe house-door opened and Penfentenyou and another came out into the now\r\nthinning rain.\r\n\r\n'Ah! There you both are! Here's Lingnam,' he cried. 'He's got a little\r\nwet. He's had to change.'\r\n\r\n'We saw that. I was too sore and weak to begin another laugh, but the\r\nAgent-General crumpled up where he stood. The late Mr. Bellamy must have\r\nbeen a man of tremendous personality, which he had impressed on every\r\nangle of his garments. I was told later that he had died in delirium\r\ntremens, which at once explained the pattern, and the reason why Mr.\r\nLingnam, writhing inside it, swore so inspiredly. Of the deliberate and\r\ndiffuse Federationist there remained no trace, save the binoculars and\r\ntwo damp whiskers. We stood on the pavement, before Elemental Man\r\ncalling on Elemental Powers to condemn and incinerate Creation.\r\n\r\n'Well, hadn't we better be getting back?' said the Agent-General.\r\n\r\n'Look out!' I remarked casually. 'Those bonnet-boxes are full of bees\r\nstill!'\r\n\r\n'Are they?' said the livid Mr. Lingnam, and tilted them over with the\r\nlate Mr. Bellamy's large boots. Deborah rolled out in drenched lumps\r\ninto the swilling gutter. There was a muffled shriek at the window where\r\nMrs. Bellamy gesticulated.\r\n\r\n'It's all right. I've paid for them,' said Mr. Lingnam. He dumped out\r\nthe last dregs like mould from a pot-bound flower-pot.\r\n\r\n'What? Are you going to take 'em home with you?' said the Agent-General.\r\n\r\n'No!' He passed a wet hand over his streaky forehead. 'Wasn't there a\r\nbicycle that was the beginning of this trouble?' said he.\r\n\r\n'It's under the fore-axle, sir,' said Holford promptly. 'I can fish it\r\nout from 'ere.'\r\n\r\n'Not till I've done with it, please.' Before we could stop him, he had\r\njumped into the car and taken charge. The hireling leaped into her\r\ncollar, surged, shrieked (less loudly than Mrs. Bellamy at the window),\r\nand swept on. That which came out behind her was, as Holford truly\r\nobserved, no joy-wheel. Mr. Lingnam swung round the big drum in the\r\nmarket-place and thundered back, shouting: 'Leave it alone. It's\r\nmy meat!'\r\n\r\n'Mince-meat, 'e means,' said Holford after this second trituration. 'You\r\ncouldn't say now it 'ad ever _been_ one, could you?'\r\n\r\nMrs. Bellamy opened the window and spoke. It appears she had only\r\ncharged for damage to the bicycle, not for the entire machine which Mr.\r\nLingnam was ruthlessly gleaning, spoke by spoke, from the highway and\r\ncramming into the slack of the hood. At last he answered, and I have\r\nnever seen a man foam at the mouth before. 'If you don't stop, I shall\r\ncome into your house--in this car--and drive upstairs and--kill you!'\r\n\r\nShe stopped; he stopped. Holford took the wheel, and we got away. It was\r\ntime, for the sun shone after the storm, and Deborah beneath the tiles\r\nand the eaves already felt its reviving influence compel her to her\r\ninterrupted labours of federation. We warned the village policeman at\r\nthe far end of the street that he might have to suspend traffic again.\r\nThe proprietor of the giddy-go-round, swings, and cocoanut-shies wanted\r\nto know from whom, in this world or another, he could recover damages.\r\nMr. Lingnam referred him most directly to Mrs. Bellamy.... Then we\r\nwent home.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner that evening Mr. Lingnam rose stiffly in his place to make\r\na few remarks on the Federation of the Empire on the lines of\r\nCo-ordinated, Offensive Operations, backed by the Entire Effective\r\nForces, Moral, Military, and Fiscal, of Permanently Mobilised\r\nCommunities, the whole brought to bear, without any respect to the\r\nmerits of any _casus belli_, instantaneously, automatically, and\r\nremorselessly at the first faint buzz of war.\r\n\r\n'The trouble with Us,' said he, 'is that We take such an infernally long\r\ntime making sure that We are right that We don't go ahead when things\r\nhappen. For instance, I ought to have gone ahead instead of pulling up\r\nwhen I hit that bicycle.'\r\n\r\n'But you were in the wrong, Lingnam, when you turned to the right,' I\r\nput in.\r\n\r\n'I don't want to hear any more of your damned, detached, mugwumping\r\nexcuses for the other fellow,' he snapped.\r\n\r\n'Now you're beginning to see things,' said Penfentenyou. 'I hope you\r\nwon't backslide when the swellings go down.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES\r\n\r\n     I was Lord of Cities very sumptuously builded.\r\n     Seven roaring Cities paid me tribute from afar.\r\n     Ivory their outposts were--the guardrooms of them\r\n       gilded,\r\n     And garrisoned with Amazons invincible in war.\r\n\r\n     All the world went softly when it walked before my\r\n       Cities--\r\n     Neither King nor Army vexed my peoples at their toil.\r\n     Never horse nor chariot irked or overbore my Cities,\r\n     Never Mob nor Ruler questioned whence they drew\r\n       their spoil.\r\n\r\n     Banded, mailed and arrogant from sunrise unto sunset,\r\n     Singing while they sacked it, they possessed the land\r\n       at large.\r\n     Yet when men would rob them, they resisted, they\r\n       made onset\r\n     And pierced the smoke of battle with a thousand-sabred\r\n       charge!\r\n\r\n     So they warred and trafficked only yesterday, my Cities.\r\n     To-day there is no mark or mound of where my Cities\r\n       stood.\r\n     For the River rose at midnight and it washed away my\r\n       Cities.\r\n     They are evened with Atlantis and the towns before the\r\n       Flood.\r\n\r\n     Rain on rain-gorged channels raised the water-levels\r\n       round them,\r\n     Freshet backed on freshet swelled and swept their\r\n       world from sight,\r\n     Till the emboldened floods linked arms and flashing forward\r\n       drowned them--\r\n     Drowned my Seven Cities and their peoples in one\r\n       night!\r\n\r\n     Low among the alders lie their derelict foundations,\r\n     The beams wherein they trusted and the plinths whereon\r\n       they built--\r\n     My rulers and their treasure and their unborn populations,\r\n     Dead, destroyed, aborted, and defiled with mud and\r\n       silt!\r\n\r\n     The Daughters of the Palace whom they cherished in\r\n       my Cities,\r\n     My silver-tongued Princesses, and the promise of their\r\n       May--\r\n     Their bridegrooms of the June-tide--all have perished\r\n       in my Cities,\r\n     With the harsh envenomed virgins that can neither\r\n       love nor play.\r\n\r\n     I was Lord of Cities--I will build anew my Cities,\r\n     Seven, set on rocks, above the wrath of any flood.\r\n     Nor will I rest from search till I have filled anew my Cities\r\n     With peoples undefeated of the dark, enduring blood.\r\n\r\n     To the sound of trumpets shall their seed restore my Cities.\r\n     Wealthy and well-weaponed, that once more may I behold\r\n     All the world go softly when it walks before my Cities,\r\n     And the horses and the chariots fleeing from them as of old!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Swept and Garnished'\r\n\r\n(January 1915)\r\n\r\nWhen the first waves of feverish cold stole over Frau Ebermann she very\r\nwisely telephoned for the doctor and went to bed. He diagnosed the\r\nattack as mild influenza, prescribed the appropriate remedies, and left\r\nher to the care of her one servant in her comfortable Berlin flat. Frau\r\nEbermann, beneath the thick coverlet, curled up with what patience she\r\ncould until the aspirin should begin to act, and Anna should come back\r\nfrom the chemist with the formamint, the ammoniated quinine, the\r\neucalyptus, and the little tin steam-inhaler. Meantime, every bone in\r\nher body ached; her head throbbed; her hot, dry hands would not stay the\r\nsame size for a minute together; and her body, tucked into the smallest\r\npossible compass, shrank from the chill of the well-warmed sheets.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden she noticed that an imitation-lace cover which should have\r\nlain mathematically square with the imitation-marble top of the radiator\r\nbehind the green plush sofa had slipped away so that one corner hung\r\nover the bronze-painted steam pipes. She recalled that she must have\r\nrested her poor head against the radiator-top while she was taking off\r\nher boots. She tried to get up and set the thing straight, but the\r\nradiator at once receded toward the horizon, which, unlike true\r\nhorizons, slanted diagonally, exactly parallel with the dropped lace\r\nedge of the cover. Frau Ebermann groaned through sticky lips and\r\nlay still.\r\n\r\n'Certainly, I have a temperature,' she said. 'Certainly, I have a grave\r\ntemperature. I should have been warned by that chill after dinner.'\r\n\r\nShe resolved to shut her hot-lidded eyes, but opened them in a little\r\nwhile to torture herself with the knowledge of that ungeometrical thing\r\nagainst the far wall. Then she saw a child--an untidy, thin-faced little\r\ngirl of about ten, who must have strayed in from the adjoining flat.\r\nThis proved--Frau Ebermann groaned again at the way the world falls to\r\nbits when one is sick--proved that Anna had forgotten to shut the outer\r\ndoor of the flat when she went to the chemist. Frau Ebermann had had\r\nchildren of her own, but they were all grown up now, and she had never\r\nbeen a child-lover in any sense. Yet the intruder might be made to serve\r\nher scheme of things.\r\n\r\n'Make--put,' she muttered thickly, 'that white thing straight on the top\r\nof that yellow thing.'\r\n\r\nThe child paid no attention, but moved about the room, investigating\r\neverything that came in her way--the yellow cut-glass handles of the\r\nchest of drawers, the stamped bronze hook to hold back the heavy puce\r\ncurtains, and the mauve enamel, New Art finger-plates on the door. Frau\r\nEbermann watched indignantly.\r\n\r\n'Aie! That is bad and rude. Go away!' she cried, though it hurt her to\r\nraise her voice. 'Go away by the road you came!' The child passed\r\nbehind the bed-foot, where she could not see her. 'Shut the door as you\r\ngo. I will speak to Anna, but--first, put that white thing straight.'\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes in misery of body and soul. The outer door clicked,\r\nand Anna entered, very penitent that she had stayed so long at the\r\nchemist's. But it had been difficult to find the proper type of\r\ninhaler, and--\r\n\r\n'Where did the child go?' moaned Frau Ebermann--'the child that was\r\nhere?'\r\n\r\n'There was no child,' said startled Anna. 'How should any child come in\r\nwhen I shut the door behind me after I go out? All the keys of the flats\r\nare different.'\r\n\r\n'No, no! You forgot this time. But my back is aching, and up my legs\r\nalso. Besides, who knows what it may have fingered and upset? Look\r\nand see.'\r\n\r\n'Nothing is fingered, nothing is upset,' Anna replied, as she took the\r\ninhaler from its paper box.\r\n\r\n'Yes, there is. Now I remember all about it. Put--put that white thing,\r\nwith the open edge--the lace, I mean--quite straight on that--' she\r\npointed. Anna, accustomed to her ways, understood and went to it.\r\n\r\n'Now, is it quite straight?' Frau Ebermann demanded.\r\n\r\n'Perfectly,' said Anna. 'In fact, in the very centre of the radiator.'\r\nAnna measured the equal margins with her knuckle, as she had been told\r\nto do when she first took service.\r\n\r\n'And my tortoise-shell hair brushes?' Frau Ebermann could not command\r\nher dressing-table from where she lay.\r\n\r\n'Perfectly straight, side by side in the big tray, and the comb laid\r\nacross them. Your watch also in the coralline watch-holder.\r\nEverything'--she moved round the room to make sure--'everything is as\r\nyou have it when you are well.' Frau Ebermann sighed with relief. It\r\nseemed to her that the room and her head had suddenly grown cooler.\r\n\r\n'Good!' said she. 'Now warm my night-gown in the kitchen, so it will be\r\nready when I have perspired. And the towels also. Make the inhaler\r\nsteam, and put in the eucalyptus; that is good for the larynx. Then sit\r\nyou in the kitchen, and come when I ring. But, first, my\r\nhot-water bottle.'\r\n\r\nIt was brought and scientifically tucked in.\r\n\r\n'What news?' said Frau Ebermann drowsily. She had not been out that day.\r\n\r\n'Another victory,' said Anna. 'Many more prisoners and guns.'\r\n\r\nFrau Ebermann purred, one might almost say grunted, contentedly.\r\n\r\n'That is good too,' she said; and Anna, after lighting the inhaler-lamp,\r\nwent out.\r\n\r\nFrau Ebermann reflected that in an hour or so the aspirin would begin to\r\nwork, and all would be well. To-morrow--no, the day after--she would\r\ntake up life with something to talk over with her friends at coffee. It\r\nwas rare--every one knew it--that she should be overcome by any\r\nailment. Yet in all her distresses she had not allowed the minutest\r\ndeviation from daily routine and ritual. She would tell her friends--she\r\nran over their names one by one--exactly what measures she had taken\r\nagainst the lace cover on the radiator-top and in regard to her two\r\ntortoise-shell hair brushes and the comb at right angles. How she had\r\nset everything in order--everything in order. She roved further afield\r\nas she wriggled her toes luxuriously on the hot-water bottle. If it\r\npleased our dear God to take her to Himself, and she was not so young as\r\nshe had been--there was that plate of the four lower ones in the blue\r\ntooth-glass, for instance--He should find all her belongings fit to meet\r\nHis eye. 'Swept and garnished' were the words that shaped themselves in\r\nher intent brain. 'Swept and garnished for--'\r\n\r\nNo, it was certainly not for the dear Lord that she had swept; she would\r\nhave her room swept out to-morrow or the day after, and garnished. Her\r\nhands began to swell again into huge pillows of nothingness. Then they\r\nshrank, and so did her head, to minute dots. It occurred to her that she\r\nwas waiting for some event, some tremendously important event, to come\r\nto pass. She lay with shut eyes for a long time till her head and hands\r\nshould return to their proper size.\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes with a jerk.\r\n\r\n'How stupid of me,' she said aloud, 'to set the room in order for a\r\nparcel of dirty little children!'\r\n\r\nThey were there--five of them, two little boys and three girls--headed\r\nby the anxious-eyed ten-year-old whom she had seen before. They must\r\nhave entered by the outer door, which Anna had neglected to shut behind\r\nher when she returned with the inhaler. She counted them backward and\r\nforward as one counts scales--one, two, three, four, five.\r\n\r\nThey took no notice of her, but hung about, first on one foot then on\r\nthe other, like strayed chickens, the smaller ones holding by the\r\nlarger. They had the air of utterly wearied passengers in a railway\r\nwaiting-room, and their clothes were disgracefully dirty.\r\n\r\n'Go away!' cried Frau Ebermann at last, after she had struggled, it\r\nseemed to her, for years to shape the words.\r\n\r\n'You called?' said Anna at the living-room door.\r\n\r\n'No,' said her mistress. 'Did you shut the flat door when you came in?'\r\n\r\n'Assuredly,' said Anna. 'Besides, it is made to catch shut of itself.'\r\n\r\n'Then go away,' said she, very little above a whisper. If Anna pretended\r\nnot to see the children, she would speak to Anna later on.\r\n\r\n'And now,' she said, turning toward them as soon as the door closed. The\r\nsmallest of the crowd smiled at her, and shook his head before he buried\r\nit in his sister's skirts.\r\n\r\n'Why--don't--you--go--away?' she whispered earnestly.\r\n\r\nAgain they took no notice, but, guided by the elder girl, set themselves\r\nto climb, boots and all, on to the green plush sofa in front of the\r\nradiator. The little boys had to be pushed, as they could not compass\r\nthe stretch unaided. They settled themselves in a row, with small gasps\r\nof relief, and pawed the plush approvingly.\r\n\r\n'I ask you--I ask you why do you not go away--why do you not go away?'\r\nFrau Ebermann found herself repeating the question twenty times. It\r\nseemed to her that everything in the world hung on the answer. 'You know\r\nyou should not come into houses and rooms unless you are invited. Not\r\nhouses and bedrooms, you know.'\r\n\r\n'No,' a solemn little six-year-old repeated, 'not houses nor bedrooms,\r\nnor dining-rooms, nor churches, nor all those places. Shouldn't come in.\r\nIt's rude.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, he said so,' the younger girl put in proudly. 'He said it. He told\r\nthem only pigs would do that.' The line nodded and dimpled one to\r\nanother with little explosive giggles, such as children use when they\r\ntell deeds of great daring against their elders.\r\n\r\n'If you know it is wrong, that makes it much worse,' said Frau Ebermann.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes; much worse,' they assented cheerfully, till the smallest boy\r\nchanged his smile to a baby wail of weariness.\r\n\r\n'When will they come for us?' he asked, and the girl at the head of the\r\nrow hauled him bodily into her square little capable lap.\r\n\r\n'He's tired,' she explained. 'He is only four. He only had his first\r\nbreeches this spring.' They came almost under his armpits, and were held\r\nup by broad linen braces, which, his sorrow diverted for the moment, he\r\npatted proudly.\r\n\r\n'Yes, beautiful, dear,' said both girls.\r\n\r\n'Go away!' said Frau Ebermann. 'Go home to your father and mother!'\r\n\r\nTheir faces grew grave at once.\r\n\r\n'H'sh! We _can't_,' whispered the eldest. 'There isn't anything left.'\r\n\r\n'All gone,' a boy echoed, and he puffed through pursed lips. 'Like\r\n_that_, uncle told me. Both cows too.'\r\n\r\n'And my own three ducks,' the boy on the girl's lap said sleepily.\r\n\r\n'So, you see, we came here.' The elder girl leaned forward a little,\r\ncaressing the child she rocked.\r\n\r\n'I--I don't understand,' said Frau Ebermann 'Are you lost, then? You\r\nmust tell our police.'\r\n\r\n'Oh no; we are only waiting.'\r\n\r\n'But what are you waiting _for?_'\r\n\r\n'We are waiting for our people to come for us. They told us to come here\r\nand wait for them. So we are waiting till they come,' the eldest\r\ngirl replied.\r\n\r\n'Yes. We are waiting till our people come for us,' said all the others\r\nin chorus.\r\n\r\n'But,' said Frau Ebermann very patiently--'but now tell me, for I tell\r\nyou that I am not in the least angry, where do you come from? Where do\r\nyou come from?'\r\n\r\nThe five gave the names of two villages of which she had read in the\r\npapers,\r\n\r\n'That is silly,' said Frau Ebermann. 'The people fired on us, and they\r\nwere punished. Those places are wiped out, stamped flat.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes, wiped out, stamped flat. That is why and--I have lost the\r\nribbon off my pigtail,' said the younger girl. She looked behind her\r\nover the sofa-back.\r\n\r\n'It is not here,' said the elder. 'It was lost before. Don't you\r\nremember?'\r\n\r\n'Now, if you are lost, you must go and tell our police. They will take\r\ncare of you and give you food,' said Frau Ebermann. 'Anna will show you\r\nthe way there.'\r\n\r\n'No,'--this was the six-year-old with the smile,--'we must wait here\r\ntill our people come for us. Mustn't we, sister?'\r\n\r\n'Of course. We wait here till our people come for us. All the world\r\nknows that,' said the eldest girl.\r\n\r\n'Yes.' The boy in her lap had waked again. 'Little children, too--as\r\nlittle as Henri, and _he_ doesn't wear trousers yet. As little as\r\nall that.'\r\n\r\n'I don't understand,' said Frau Ebermann, shivering. In spite of the\r\nheat of the room and the damp breath of the steam-inhaler, the aspirin\r\nwas not doing its duty.\r\n\r\nThe girl raised her blue eyes and looked at the woman for an instant.\r\n\r\n'You see,' she said, emphasising her statements with her ringers,\r\n'_they_ told _us_ to wait _here_ till _our_ people came for us. So we\r\ncame. We wait till our people come for us.'\r\n\r\n'That is silly again,' said Frau Ebermann. 'It is no good for you to\r\nwait here. Do you know what this place is? You have been to school? It\r\nis Berlin, the capital of Germany.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes,' they all cried; 'Berlin, capital of Germany. We know that.\r\nThat is why we came.'\r\n\r\n'So, you see, it is no good,' she said triumphantly, 'because your\r\npeople can never come for you here.'\r\n\r\n'They told us to come here and wait till our people came for us.' They\r\ndelivered this as if it were a lesson in school. Then they sat still,\r\ntheir hands orderly folded on their laps, smiling as sweetly as ever.\r\n\r\n'Go away! Go away!' Frau Ebermann shrieked.\r\n\r\n'You called?' said Anna, entering.\r\n\r\n'No. Go away! Go away!'\r\n\r\n'Very good, old cat,' said the maid under her breath. 'Next time you\r\n_may_ call,' and she returned to her friend in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n'I ask you--ask you, _please_ to go away,' Frau Ebermann pleaded. 'Go to\r\nmy Anna through that door, and she will give you cakes and sweeties. It\r\nis not kind of you to come into my room and behave so badly.'\r\n\r\n'Where else shall we go now?' the elder girl demanded, turning to her\r\nlittle company. They fell into discussion. One preferred the broad\r\nstreet with trees, another the railway station; but when she suggested\r\nan Emperor's palace, they agreed with her.\r\n\r\n'We will go then,' she said, and added half apologetically to Frau\r\nEbermann, 'You see, they are so little they like to meet all\r\nthe others.'\r\n\r\n'What others?' said Frau Ebermann.\r\n\r\n'The others--hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of the\r\nothers.'\r\n\r\n'That is a lie. There cannot be a hundred even, much less a thousand,'\r\ncried Frau Ebermann.\r\n\r\n'So?' said the girl politely.\r\n\r\n'Yes. _I_ tell you; and I have very good information. I know how it\r\nhappened. You should have been more careful. You should not have run out\r\nto see the horses and guns passing. That is how it is done when our\r\ntroops pass through. My son has written me so.'\r\n\r\nThey had clambered down from the sofa, and gathered round the bed with\r\neager, interested eyes.\r\n\r\n'Horses and guns going by--how fine!' some one whispered.\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes; believe me, _that_ is how the accidents to the children\r\nhappen. You must know yourself that it is true. One runs out to look--'\r\n\r\n'But I never saw any at all,' a boy cried sorrowfully. 'Only one noise I\r\nheard. That was when Aunt Emmeline's house fell down.'\r\n\r\n'But listen to me. _I_ am telling you! One runs out to look, because one\r\nis little and cannot see well. So one peeps between the man's legs, and\r\nthen--you know how close those big horses and guns turn the\r\ncorners--then one's foot slips and one gets run over. That's how it\r\nhappens. Several times it had happened, but not many times; certainly\r\nnot a hundred, perhaps not twenty. So, you see, you _must_ be all. Tell\r\nme now that you are all that there are, and Anna shall give you\r\nthe cakes.'\r\n\r\n'Thousands,' a boy repeated monotonously. 'Then we all come here to\r\nwait till our people come for us.'\r\n\r\n'But now we will go away from here. The poor lady is tired,' said the\r\nelder girl, plucking his sleeve.\r\n\r\n'Oh, you hurt, you hurt!' he cried, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n'What is that for?' said Frau Ebermann. 'To cry in a room where a poor\r\nlady is sick is very inconsiderate.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, but look, lady!' said the elder girl.\r\n\r\nFrau Ebermann looked and saw.\r\n\r\n'_Au revoir_, lady.' They made their little smiling bows and curtseys\r\nundisturbed by her loud cries. '_Au revoir,_ lady. We will wait till our\r\npeople come for us.'\r\n\r\nWhen Anna at last ran in, she found her mistress on her knees, busily\r\ncleaning the floor with the lace cover from the radiator, because, she\r\nexplained, it was all spotted with the blood of five children--she was\r\nperfectly certain there could not be more than five in the whole\r\nworld--who had gone away for the moment, but were now waiting round the\r\ncorner, and Anna was to find them and give them cakes to stop the\r\nbleeding, while her mistress swept and garnished that Our dear Lord when\r\nHe came might find everything as it should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Postgate\r\n\r\n(1915)\r\n\r\nOf Miss Mary Postgate, Lady McCausland wrote that she was 'thoroughly\r\nconscientious, tidy, companionable, and ladylike. I am very sorry to\r\npart with her, and shall always be interested in her welfare.'\r\n\r\nMiss Fowler engaged her on this recommendation, and to her surprise, for\r\nshe had had experience of companions, found that it was true. Miss\r\nFowler was nearer sixty than fifty at the time, but though she needed\r\ncare she did not exhaust her attendant's vitality. On the contrary, she\r\ngave out, stimulatingly and with reminiscences. Her father had been a\r\nminor Court official in the days when the Great Exhibition of 1851 had\r\njust set its seal on Civilisation made perfect. Some of Miss Fowler's\r\ntales, none the less, were not always for the young. Mary was not young,\r\nand though her speech was as colourless as her eyes or her hair, she was\r\nnever shocked. She listened unflinchingly to every one; said at the end,\r\n'How interesting!' or 'How shocking!' as the case might be, and never\r\nagain referred to it, for she prided herself on a trained mind, which\r\n'did not dwell on these things.' She was, too, a treasure at domestic\r\naccounts, for which the village tradesmen, with their weekly books,\r\nloved her not. Otherwise she had no enemies; provoked no jealousy even\r\namong the plainest; neither gossip nor slander had ever been traced to\r\nher; she supplied the odd place at the Rector's or the Doctor's table at\r\nhalf an hour's notice; she was a sort of public aunt to very many small\r\nchildren of the village street, whose parents, while accepting\r\neverything, would have been swift to resent what they called\r\n'patronage'; she served on the Village Nursing Committee as Miss\r\nFowler's nominee when Miss Fowler was crippled by rheumatoid arthritis,\r\nand came out of six months' fortnightly meetings equally respected by\r\nall the cliques.\r\n\r\nAnd when Fate threw Miss Fowler's nephew, an unlovely orphan of eleven,\r\non Miss Fowler's hands, Mary Postgate stood to her share of the business\r\nof education as practised in private and public schools. She checked\r\nprinted clothes-lists, and unitemised bills of extras; wrote to Head and\r\nHouse masters, matrons, nurses and doctors, and grieved or rejoiced over\r\nhalf-term reports. Young Wyndham Fowler repaid her in his holidays by\r\ncalling her 'Gatepost,' 'Postey,' or 'Packthread,' by thumping her\r\nbetween her narrow shoulders, or by chasing her bleating, round the\r\ngarden, her large mouth open, her large nose high in air, at a\r\nstiff-necked shamble very like a camel's. Later on he filled the house\r\nwith clamour, argument, and harangues as to his personal needs, likes\r\nand dislikes, and the limitations of 'you women,' reducing Mary to tears\r\nof physical fatigue, or, when he chose to be humorous, of helpless\r\nlaughter. At crises, which multiplied as he grew older, she was his\r\nambassadress and his interpretress to Miss Fowler, who had no large\r\nsympathy with the young; a vote in his interest at the councils on his\r\nfuture; his sewing-woman, strictly accountable for mislaid boots and\r\ngarments; always his butt and his slave.\r\n\r\nAnd when he decided to become a solicitor, and had entered an office in\r\nLondon; when his greeting had changed from 'Hullo, Postey, you old\r\nbeast,' to Mornin', Packthread,' there came a war which, unlike all wars\r\nthat Mary could remember, did not stay decently outside England and in\r\nthe newspapers, but intruded on the lives of people whom she knew. As\r\nshe said to Miss Fowler, it was 'most vexatious.' It took the Rector's\r\nson who was going into business with his elder brother; it took the\r\nColonel's nephew on the eve of fruit-farming in Canada; it took Mrs.\r\nGrant's son who, his mother said, was devoted to the ministry; and, very\r\nearly indeed, it took Wynn Fowler, who announced on a postcard that he\r\nhad joined the Flying Corps and wanted a cardigan waistcoat.\r\n\r\n'He must go, and he must have the waistcoat,' said Miss Fowler. So Mary\r\ngot the proper-sized needles and wool, while Miss Fowler told the men of\r\nher establishment--two gardeners and an odd man, aged sixty--that those\r\nwho could join the Army had better do so. The gardeners left. Cheape,\r\nthe odd man, stayed on, and was promoted to the gardener's cottage. The\r\ncook, scorning to be limited in luxuries, also left, after a spirited\r\nscene with Miss Fowler, and took the housemaid with her. Miss Fowler\r\ngazetted Nellie, Cheape's seventeen-year-old daughter, to the vacant\r\npost; Mrs. Cheape to the rank of cook, with occasional cleaning bouts;\r\nand the reduced establishment moved forward smoothly.\r\n\r\nWynn demanded an increase in his allowance. Miss Fowler, who always\r\nlooked facts in the face, said, 'He must have it. The chances are he\r\nwon't live long to draw it, and if three hundred makes him happy--'\r\n\r\nWynn was grateful, and came over, in his tight-buttoned uniform, to say\r\nso. His training centre was not thirty miles away, and his talk was so\r\ntechnical that it had to be explained by charts of the various types of\r\nmachines. He gave Mary such a chart.\r\n\r\n'And you'd better study it, Postey,' he said. 'You'll be seeing a lot of\r\n'em soon.' So Mary studied the chart, but when Wynn next arrived to\r\nswell and exalt himself before his womenfolk, she failed badly in\r\ncross-examination, and he rated her as in the old days.\r\n\r\n'You _look_ more or less like a human being,' he said in his new Service\r\nvoice. 'You _must_ have had a brain at some time in your past. What have\r\nyou done with it? Where d'you keep it? A sheep would know more than you\r\ndo, Postey. You're lamentable. You are less use than an empty tin can,\r\nyou dowey old cassowary.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose that's how your superior officer talks to _you_?' said Miss\r\nFowler from her chair.\r\n\r\n'But Postey doesn't mind,' Wynn replied. 'Do you, Packthread?'\r\n\r\n'Why? Was Wynn saying anything? I shall get this right next time you\r\ncome,' she muttered, and knitted her pale brows again over the diagrams\r\nof Taubes, Farmans, and Zeppelins.\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks the mere land and sea battles which she read to Miss\r\nFowler after breakfast passed her like idle breath. Her heart and her\r\ninterest were high in the air with Wynn, who had finished 'rolling'\r\n(whatever that might be) and had gone on from a 'taxi' to a machine more\r\nor less his own. One morning it circled over their very chimneys,\r\nalighted on Vegg's Heath, almost outside the garden gate, and Wynn came\r\nin, blue with cold, shouting for food. He and she drew Miss Fowler's\r\nbath-chair, as they had often done, along the Heath foot-path to look at\r\nthe bi-plane. Mary observed that 'it smelt very badly.'\r\n\r\n'Postey, I believe you think with your nose,' said Wynn. 'I know you\r\ndon't with your mind. Now, what type's that?'\r\n\r\n'I'll go and get the chart,' said Mary.\r\n\r\n'You're hopeless! You haven't the mental capacity of a white mouse,' he\r\ncried, and explained the dials and the sockets for bomb-dropping till it\r\nwas time to mount and ride the wet clouds once more.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said Mary, as the stinking thing flared upward. 'Wait till our\r\nFlying Corps gets to work! Wynn says it's much safer than in the\r\ntrenches.'\r\n\r\n'I wonder,' said Miss Fowler. 'Tell Cheape to come and tow me home\r\nagain.'\r\n\r\n'It's all downhill. I can do it,' said Mary, 'if you put the brake on.'\r\nShe laid her lean self against the pushing-bar and home they trundled.\r\n\r\n'Now, be careful you aren't heated and catch a chill,' said overdressed\r\nMiss Fowler.\r\n\r\n'Nothing makes me perspire,' said Mary. As she bumped the chair under\r\nthe porch she straightened her long back. The exertion had given her a\r\ncolour, and the wind had loosened a wisp of hair across her forehead.\r\nMiss Fowler glanced at her.\r\n\r\n'What do you ever think of, Mary?' she demanded suddenly.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Wynn says he wants another three pairs of stockings--as thick as we\r\ncan make them.'\r\n\r\n'Yes. But I mean the things that women think about. Here you are, more\r\nthan forty--'\r\n\r\n'Forty-four,' said truthful Mary.\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'Well?' Mary offered Miss Fowler her shoulder as usual.\r\n\r\n'And you've been with me ten years now.'\r\n\r\n'Let's see,' said Mary. 'Wynn was eleven when he came. He's twenty now,\r\nand I came two years before that. It must be eleven.'\r\n\r\n'Eleven! And you've never told me anything that matters in all that\r\nwhile. Looking back, it seems to me that _I_'ve done all the talking.'\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid I'm not much of a conversationalist. As Wynn says, I haven't\r\nthe mind. Let me take your hat.'\r\n\r\nMiss Fowler, moving stiffly from the hip, stamped her rubber-tipped\r\nstick on the tiled hall floor. 'Mary, aren't you _anything_ except a\r\ncompanion? Would you _ever_ have been anything except a companion?'\r\n\r\nMary hung up the garden hat on its proper peg. 'No,' she said after\r\nconsideration. 'I don't imagine I ever should. But I've no imagination,\r\nI'm afraid.'\r\n\r\nShe fetched Miss Fowler her eleven-o'clock glass of Contrexéville.\r\n\r\nThat was the wet December when it rained six inches to the month, and\r\nthe women went abroad as little as might be. Wynn's flying chariot\r\nvisited them several times, and for two mornings (he had warned her by\r\npostcard) Mary heard the thresh of his propellers at dawn. The second\r\ntime she ran to the window, and stared at the whitening sky. A little\r\nblur passed overhead. She lifted her lean arms towards it.\r\n\r\nThat evening at six o'clock there came an announcement in an official\r\nenvelope that Second Lieutenant W. Fowler had been killed during a trial\r\nflight. Death was instantaneous. She read it and carried it to\r\nMiss Fowler.\r\n\r\n'I never expected anything else,' said Miss Fowler; 'but I'm sorry it\r\nhappened before he had done anything.'\r\n\r\nThe room was whirling round Mary Postgate, but she found herself quite\r\nsteady in the midst of it.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' she said. 'It's a great pity he didn't die in action after he had\r\nkilled somebody.'\r\n\r\n'He was killed instantly. That's one comfort,' Miss Fowler went on.\r\n\r\n'But Wynn says the shock of a fall kills a man at once--whatever happens\r\nto the tanks,' quoted Mary.\r\n\r\nThe room was coming to rest now. She heard Miss Fowler say impatiently,\r\n'But why can't we cry, Mary?' and herself replying, 'There's nothing to\r\ncry for. He has done his duty as much as Mrs. Grant's son did.'\r\n\r\n'And when he died, _she_ came and cried all the morning,' said Miss\r\nFowler. 'This only makes me feel tired--terribly tired. Will you help me\r\nto bed, please, Mary?--And I think I'd like the hot-water bottle.'\r\n\r\nSo Mary helped her and sat beside, talking of Wynn in his riotous youth.\r\n\r\n'I believe,' said Miss Fowler suddenly, 'that old people and young\r\npeople slip from under a stroke like this. The middle-aged feel\r\nit most.'\r\n\r\n'I expect that's true,' said Mary, rising. 'I'm going to put away the\r\nthings in his room now. Shall we wear mourning?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly not,' said Miss Fowler. 'Except, of course, at the funeral. I\r\ncan't go. You will. I want you to arrange about his being buried here.\r\nWhat a blessing it didn't happen at Salisbury!'\r\n\r\nEvery one, from the Authorities of the Flying Corps to the Rector, was\r\nmost kind and sympathetic. Mary found herself for the moment in a world\r\nwhere bodies were in the habit of being despatched by all sorts of\r\nconveyances to all sorts of places. And at the funeral two young men in\r\nbuttoned-up uniforms stood beside the grave and spoke to her afterwards.\r\n\r\n'You're Miss Postgate, aren't you?' said one. 'Fowler told me about you.\r\nHe was a good chap--a first-class fellow--a great loss.'\r\n\r\n'Great loss!' growled his companion. 'We're all awfully sorry.'\r\n\r\n'How high did he fall from?' Mary whispered.\r\n\r\n'Pretty nearly four thousand feet, I should think, didn't he? You were\r\nup that day, Monkey?'\r\n\r\n'All of that,' the other child replied. 'My bar made three thousand, and\r\nI wasn't as high as him by a lot.'\r\n\r\n'Then _that's_ all right,' said Mary. 'Thank you very much.'\r\n\r\nThey moved away as Mrs. Grant flung herself weeping on Mary's flat\r\nchest, under the lych-gate, and cried, '_I_ know how it feels! _I_ know\r\nhow it feels!'\r\n\r\n'But both his parents are dead,' Mary returned, as she fended her off.\r\n'Perhaps they've all met by now,' she added vaguely as she escaped\r\ntowards the coach.\r\n\r\n'I've thought of that too,' wailed Mrs. Grant; 'but then he'll be\r\npractically a stranger to them. Quite embarrassing!'\r\n\r\nMary faithfully reported every detail of the ceremony to Miss Fowler,\r\nwho, when she described Mrs. Grant's outburst, laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n'Oh, how Wynn would have enjoyed it! He was always utterly unreliable at\r\nfunerals. D'you remember--' And they talked of him again, each piecing\r\nout the other's gaps. 'And now,' said Miss Fowler, 'we'll pull up the\r\nblinds and we'll have a general tidy. That always does us good. Have you\r\nseen to Wynn's things?'\r\n\r\n'Everything--since he first came,' said Mary. 'He was never\r\ndestructive--even with his toys.'\r\n\r\nThey faced that neat room.\r\n\r\n'It can't be natural not to cry,' Mary said at last. 'I'm _so_ afraid\r\nyou'll have a reaction.'\r\n\r\n'As I told you, we old people slip from under the stroke. It's you I'm\r\nafraid for. Have you cried yet?'\r\n\r\n'I can't. It only makes me angry with the Germans.'\r\n\r\n'That's sheer waste of vitality,' said Miss Fowler. 'We must live till\r\nthe war's finished.' She opened a full wardrobe. 'Now, I've been\r\nthinking things over. This is my plan. All his civilian clothes can be\r\ngiven away--Belgian refugees, and so on.'\r\n\r\nMary nodded. 'Boots, collars, and gloves?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. We don't need to keep anything except his cap and belt.'\r\n\r\n'They came back yesterday with his Flying Corps clothes'--Mary pointed\r\nto a roll on the little iron bed.\r\n\r\n'Ah, but keep his Service things. Some one may be glad of them later. Do\r\nyou remember his sizes?'\r\n\r\n'Five feet eight and a half; thirty-six inches round the chest. But he\r\ntold me he's just put on an inch and a half. I'll mark it on a label and\r\ntie it on his sleeping-bag.'\r\n\r\n'So that disposes of _that_,' said Miss Fowler, tapping the palm of one\r\nhand with the ringed third finger of the other. 'What waste it all is!\r\nWe'll get his old school trunk to-morrow and pack his civilian clothes.'\r\n\r\n'And the rest?' said Mary. 'His books and pictures and the games and the\r\ntoys--and--and the rest?'\r\n\r\n'My plan is to burn every single thing,' said Miss Fowler. 'Then we\r\nshall know where they are and no one can handle them afterwards. What do\r\nyou think?'\r\n\r\n'I think that would be much the best,' said Mary. 'But there's such a\r\nlot of them.'\r\n\r\n'We'll burn them in the destructor,' said Miss Fowler.\r\n\r\nThis was an open-air furnace for the consumption of refuse; a little\r\ncircular four-foot tower of pierced brick over an iron grating. Miss\r\nFowler had noticed the design in a gardening journal years ago, and had\r\nhad it built at the bottom of the garden. It suited her tidy soul, for\r\nit saved unsightly rubbish-heaps, and the ashes lightened the stiff\r\nclay soil.\r\n\r\nMary considered for a moment, saw her way clear, and nodded again. They\r\nspent the evening putting away well-remembered civilian suits,\r\nunderclothes that Mary had marked, and the regiments of very gaudy socks\r\nand ties. A second trunk was needed, and, after that, a little\r\npacking-case, and it was late next day when Cheape and the local carrier\r\nlifted them to the cart. The Rector luckily knew of a friend's son,\r\nabout five feet eight and a half inches high, to whom a complete Flying\r\nCorps outfit would be most acceptable, and sent his gardener's son down\r\nwith a barrow to take delivery of it. The cap was hung up in Miss\r\nFowler's bedroom, the belt in Miss Postgate's; for, as Miss Fowler said,\r\nthey had no desire to make tea-party talk of them.\r\n\r\n'That disposes of _that_,' said Miss Fowler. 'I'll leave the rest to\r\nyou, Mary. I can't run up and down the garden. You'd better take the big\r\nclothes-basket and get Nellie to help you.'\r\n\r\n'I shall take the wheel-barrow and do it myself,' said Mary, and for\r\nonce in her life closed her mouth.\r\n\r\nMiss Fowler, in moments of irritation, had called Mary deadly\r\nmethodical. She put on her oldest waterproof and gardening-hat and her\r\never-slipping goloshes, for the weather was on the edge of more rain.\r\nShe gathered fire-lighters from the kitchen, a half-scuttle of coals,\r\nand a faggot of brushwood. These she wheeled in the barrow down the\r\nmossed paths to the dank little laurel shrubbery where the destructor\r\nstood under the drip of three oaks. She climbed the wire fence into the\r\nRector's glebe just behind, and from his tenant's rick pulled two large\r\narmfuls of good hay, which she spread neatly on the fire-bars. Next,\r\njourney by journey, passing Miss Fowler's white face at the morning-room\r\nwindow each time, she brought down in the towel-covered clothes-basket,\r\non the wheel-barrow, thumbed and used Hentys, Marryats, Levers,\r\nStevensons, Baroness Orczys, Garvices, schoolbooks, and atlases,\r\nunrelated piles of the _Motor Cyclist_, the _Light Car_, and catalogues\r\nof Olympia Exhibitions; the remnants of a fleet of sailing-ships from\r\nninepenny cutters to a three-guinea yacht; a prep.-school dressing-gown;\r\nbats from three-and-sixpence to twenty-four shillings; cricket and\r\ntennis balls; disintegrated steam and clockwork locomotives with their\r\ntwisted rails; a grey and red tin model of a submarine; a dumb\r\ngramophone and cracked records; golf-clubs that had to be broken across\r\nthe knee, like his walking-sticks, and an assegai; photographs of\r\nprivate and public school cricket and football elevens, and his O.T.C.\r\non the line of march; kodaks, and film-rolls; some pewters, and one real\r\nsilver cup, for boxing competitions and Junior Hurdles; sheaves of\r\nschool photographs; Miss Fowler's photograph; her own which he had borne\r\noff in fun and (good care she took not to ask!) had never returned; a\r\nplaybox with a secret drawer; a load of flannels, belts, and jerseys,\r\nand a pair of spiked shoes unearthed in the attic; a packet of all the\r\nletters that Miss Fowler and she had ever written to him, kept for some\r\nabsurd reason through all these years; a five-day attempt at a diary;\r\nframed pictures of racing motors in full Brooklands career, and load\r\nupon load of undistinguishable wreckage of tool-boxes, rabbit-hutches,\r\nelectric batteries, tin soldiers, fret-saw outfits, and jig-saw puzzles.\r\n\r\nMiss Fowler at the window watched her come and go, and said to herself,\r\n'Mary's an old woman. I never realised it before.'\r\n\r\nAfter lunch she recommended her to rest.\r\n\r\n'I'm not in the least tired,' said Mary. 'I've got it all arranged. I'm\r\ngoing to the village at two o'clock for some paraffin. Nellie hasn't\r\nenough, and the walk will do me good.'\r\n\r\nShe made one last quest round the house before she started, and found\r\nthat she had overlooked nothing. It began to mist as soon as she had\r\nskirted Vegg's Heath, where Wynn used to descend--it seemed to her that\r\nshe could almost hear the beat of his propellers overhead, but there was\r\nnothing to see. She hoisted her umbrella and lunged into the blind wet\r\ntill she had reached the shelter of the empty village. As she came out\r\nof Mr. Kidd's shop with a bottle full of paraffin in her string\r\nshopping-bag, she met Nurse Eden, the village nurse, and fell into talk\r\nwith her, as usual, about the village children. They were just parting\r\nopposite the 'Royal Oak,' when a gun, they fancied, was fired\r\nimmediately behind the house. It was followed by a child's shriek dying\r\ninto a wail.\r\n\r\n'Accident!' said Nurse Eden promptly, and dashed through the empty bar,\r\nfollowed by Mary. They found Mrs. Gerritt, the publican's wife, who\r\ncould only gasp and point to the yard, where a little cart-lodge was\r\nsliding sideways amid a clatter of tiles. Nurse Eden snatched up a sheet\r\ndrying before the fire, ran out, lifted something from the ground, and\r\nflung the sheet round it. The sheet turned scarlet and half her uniform\r\ntoo, as she bore the load into the kitchen. It was little Edna Gerritt,\r\naged nine, whom Mary had known since her perambulator days.\r\n\r\n'Am I hurted bad?' Edna asked, and died between Nurse Eden's dripping\r\nhands. The sheet fell aside and for an instant, before she could shut\r\nher eyes, Mary saw the ripped and shredded body.\r\n\r\n'It's a wonder she spoke at all,' said Nurse Eden. 'What in God's name\r\nwas it?'\r\n\r\n'A bomb,' said Mary.\r\n\r\n'One o' the Zeppelins?'\r\n\r\n'No. An aeroplane. I thought I heard it on the Heath, but I fancied it\r\nwas one of ours. It must have shut off its engines as it came down.\r\nThat's why we didn't notice it.'\r\n\r\n'The filthy pigs!' said Nurse Eden, all white and shaken. 'See the\r\npickle I'm in! Go and tell Dr. Hennis, Miss Postgate.' Nurse looked at\r\nthe mother, who had dropped face down on the floor. 'She's only in a\r\nfit. Turn her over.'\r\n\r\nMary heaved Mrs. Gerritt right side up, and hurried off for the doctor.\r\nWhen she told her tale, he asked her to sit down in the surgery till he\r\ngot her something.\r\n\r\n'But I don't need it, I assure you,' said she. 'I don't think it would\r\nbe wise to tell Miss Fowler about it, do you? Her heart is so irritable\r\nin this weather.'\r\n\r\nDr. Hennis looked at her admiringly as he packed up his bag.\r\n\r\n'No. Don't tell anybody till we're sure,' he said, and hastened to the\r\n'Royal Oak,' while Mary went on with the paraffin. The village behind\r\nher was as quiet as usual, for the news had not yet spread. She frowned\r\na little to herself, her large nostrils expanded uglily, and from time\r\nto time she muttered a phrase which Wynn, who never restrained himself\r\nbefore his womenfolk, had applied to the enemy. 'Bloody pagans! They\r\n_are_ bloody pagans. But,' she continued, falling back on the teaching\r\nthat had made her what she was, 'one mustn't let one's mind dwell on\r\nthese things.'\r\n\r\nBefore she reached the house Dr. Hennis, who was also a special\r\nconstable, overtook her in his car.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Miss Postgate,' he said, 'I wanted to tell you that that accident\r\nat the \"Royal Oak\" was due to Gerritt's stable tumbling down. It's been\r\ndangerous for a long time. It ought to have been condemned.'\r\n\r\n'I thought I heard an explosion too,' said Mary.\r\n\r\n'You might have been misled by the beams snapping. I've been looking at\r\n'em. They were dry-rotted through and through. Of course, as they broke,\r\nthey would make a noise just like a gun.'\r\n\r\n'Yes?' said Mary politely.\r\n\r\n'Poor little Edna was playing underneath it,' he went on, still holding\r\nher with his eyes, 'and that and the tiles cut her to pieces, you see?'\r\n\r\n'I saw it,' said Mary, shaking her head. 'I heard it too.'\r\n\r\n'Well, we cannot be sure.' Dr. Hennis changed his tone completely. 'I\r\nknow both you and Nurse Eden (I've been speaking to her) are perfectly\r\ntrustworthy, and I can rely on you not to say anything--yet at least. It\r\nis no good to stir up people unless--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I never do--anyhow,' said Mary, and Dr. Hennis went on to the\r\ncounty town.\r\n\r\nAfter all, she told herself, it might, just possibly, have been the\r\ncollapse of the old stable that had done all those things to poor little\r\nEdna. She was sorry she had even hinted at other things, but Nurse Eden\r\nwas discretion itself. By the time she reached home the affair seemed\r\nincreasingly remote by its very monstrosity. As she came in, Miss Fowler\r\ntold her that a couple of aeroplanes had passed half an hour ago.\r\n\r\n'I thought I heard them,' she replied, 'I'm going down to the garden\r\nnow. I've got the paraffin.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but--what _have_ you got on your boots? They're soaking wet.\r\nChange them at once.'\r\n\r\nNot only did Mary obey but she wrapped the boots in a newspaper, and\r\nput them into the string bag with the bottle. So, armed with the longest\r\nkitchen poker, she left.\r\n\r\n'It's raining again,' was Miss Fowler's last word, 'but--I know you\r\nwon't be happy till that's disposed of.'\r\n\r\n'It won't take long. I've got everything down there, and I've put the\r\nlid on the destructor to keep the wet out.'\r\n\r\nThe shrubbery was filling with twilight by the time she had completed\r\nher arrangements and sprinkled the sacrificial oil. As she lit the match\r\nthat would burn her heart to ashes, she heard a groan or a grunt behind\r\nthe dense Portugal laurels.\r\n\r\n'Cheape?' she called impatiently, but Cheape, with his ancient lumbago,\r\nin his comfortable cottage would be the last man to profane the\r\nsanctuary. 'Sheep,' she concluded, and threw in the fusee. The pyre went\r\nup in a roar, and the immediate flame hastened night around her.\r\n\r\n'How Wynn would have loved this!' she thought, stepping back from the\r\nblaze.\r\n\r\nBy its light she saw, half hidden behind a laurel not five paces away, a\r\nbareheaded man sitting very stiffly at the foot of one of the oaks. A\r\nbroken branch lay across his lap--one booted leg protruding from beneath\r\nit. His head moved ceaselessly from side to side, but his body was as\r\nstill as the tree's trunk. He was dressed--she moved sideways to look\r\nmore closely--in a uniform something like Wynn's, with a flap buttoned\r\nacross the chest. For an instant, she had some idea that it might be\r\none of the young flying men she had met at the funeral. But their heads\r\nwere dark and glossy. This man's was as pale as a baby's, and so closely\r\ncropped that she could see the disgusting pinky skin beneath. His\r\nlips moved.\r\n\r\n'What do you say?' Mary moved towards him and stooped.\r\n\r\n'Laty! Laty! Laty!' he muttered, while his hands picked at the dead wet\r\nleaves. There was no doubt as to his nationality. It made her so angry\r\nthat she strode back to the destructor, though it was still too hot to\r\nuse the poker there. Wynn's books seemed to be catching well. She looked\r\nup at the oak behind the man; several of the light upper and two or\r\nthree rotten lower branches had broken and scattered their rubbish on\r\nthe shrubbery path. On the lowest fork a helmet with dependent strings,\r\nshowed like a bird's-nest in the light of a long-tongued flame.\r\nEvidently this person had fallen through the tree. Wynn had told her\r\nthat it was quite possible for people to fall out of aeroplanes. Wynn\r\ntold her too, that trees were useful things to break an aviator's fall,\r\nbut in this case the aviator must have been broken or he would have\r\nmoved from his queer position. He seemed helpless except for his\r\nhorrible rolling head. On the other hand, she could see a pistol case at\r\nhis belt--and Mary loathed pistols. Months ago, after reading certain\r\nBelgian reports together, she and Miss Fowler had had dealings with\r\none--a huge revolver with flat-nosed bullets, which latter, Wynn said,\r\nwere forbidden by the rules of war to be used against civilised\r\nenemies. 'They're good enough for us,' Miss Fowler had replied. 'Show\r\nMary how it works.' And Wynn, laughing at the mere possibility of any\r\nsuch need, had led the craven winking Mary into the Rector's disused\r\nquarry, and had shown her how to fire the terrible machine. It lay now\r\nin the top-left-hand drawer of her toilet-table--a memento not included\r\nin the burning. Wynn would be pleased to see how she was not afraid.\r\n\r\nShe slipped up to the house to get it. When she came through the rain,\r\nthe eyes in the head were alive with expectation. The mouth even tried\r\nto smile. But at sight of the revolver its corners went down just like\r\nEdna Gerritt's. A tear trickled from one eye, and the head rolled from\r\nshoulder to shoulder as though trying to point out something.\r\n\r\n'Cassée. Tout cassée,' it whimpered.\r\n\r\n'What do you say?' said Mary disgustedly, keeping well to one side,\r\nthough only the head moved.\r\n\r\n'Cassée,' it repeated. 'Che me rends. Le médicin! Toctor!'\r\n\r\n'Nein!' said she, bringing all her small German to bear with the big\r\npistol. 'Ich haben der todt Kinder gesehn.'\r\n\r\nThe head was still. Mary's hand dropped. She had been careful to keep\r\nher finger off the trigger for fear of accidents. After a few moments'\r\nwaiting, she returned to the destructor, where the flames were falling,\r\nand churned up Wynn's charring books with the poker. Again the head\r\ngroaned for the doctor.\r\n\r\n'Stop that!' said Mary, and stamped her foot. 'Stop that, you bloody\r\npagan!'\r\n\r\nThe words came quite smoothly and naturally. They were Wynn's own words,\r\nand Wynn was a gentleman who for no consideration on earth would have\r\ntorn little Edna into those vividly coloured strips and strings. But\r\nthis thing hunched under the oak-tree had done that thing. It was no\r\nquestion of reading horrors out of newspapers to Miss Fowler. Mary had\r\nseen it with her own eyes on the 'Royal Oak' kitchen table. She must not\r\nallow her mind to dwell upon it. Now Wynn was dead, and everything\r\nconnected with him was lumping and rustling and tinkling under her busy\r\npoker into red black dust and grey leaves of ash. The thing beneath the\r\noak would die too. Mary had seen death more than once. She came of a\r\nfamily that had a knack of dying under, as she told Miss Fowler, 'most\r\ndistressing circumstances.' She would stay where she was till she was\r\nentirely satisfied that It was dead--dead as dear papa in the late\r\n'eighties; aunt Mary in eighty-nine; mamma in 'ninety-one; cousin Dick\r\nin ninety-five; Lady McCausland's housemaid in 'ninety-nine; Lady\r\nMcCausland's sister in nineteen hundred and one; Wynn buried five days\r\nago; and Edna Gerritt still waiting for decent earth to hide her. As she\r\nthought--her underlip caught up by one faded canine, brows knit and\r\nnostrils wide--she wielded the poker with lunges that jarred the grating\r\nat the bottom, and careful scrapes round the brick-work above. She\r\nlooked at her wrist-watch. It was getting on to half-past four, and the\r\nrain was coming down in earnest. Tea would be at five. If It did not die\r\nbefore that time, she would be soaked and would have to change.\r\nMeantime, and this occupied her, Wynn's things were burning well in\r\nspite of the hissing wet, though now and again a book-back with a quite\r\ndistinguishable title would be heaved up out of the mass. The exercise\r\nof stoking had given her a glow which seemed to reach to the marrow of\r\nher bones. She hummed--Mary never had a voice--to herself. She had never\r\nbelieved in all those advanced views--though Miss Fowler herself leaned\r\na little that way--of woman's work in the world; but now she saw there\r\nwas much to be said for them. This, for instance, was _her_ work--work\r\nwhich no man, least of all Dr. Hennis, would ever have done. A man, at\r\nsuch a crisis, would be what Wynn called a 'sportsman'; would leave\r\neverything to fetch help, and would certainly bring It into the house.\r\nNow a woman's business was to make a happy home for--for a husband and\r\nchildren. Failing these--it was not a thing one should allow one's mind\r\nto dwell upon--but--\r\n\r\n'Stop it!' Mary cried once more across the shadows. 'Nein, I tell you!\r\nIch haben der todt Kinder gesehn.'\r\n\r\n_But_ it was a fact. A woman who had missed these things could still be\r\nuseful--more useful than a man in certain respects. She thumped like a\r\npavior through the settling ashes at the secret thrill of it. The rain\r\nwas damping the fire, but she could feel--it was too dark to see--that\r\nher work was done. There was a dull red glow at the bottom of the\r\ndestructor, not enough to char the wooden lid if she slipped it half\r\nover against the driving wet. This arranged, she leaned on the poker and\r\nwaited, while an increasing rapture laid hold on her. She ceased to\r\nthink. She gave herself up to feel. Her long pleasure was broken by a\r\nsound that she had waited for in agony several times in her life. She\r\nleaned forward and listened, smiling. There could be no mistake. She\r\nclosed her eyes and drank it in. Once it ceased abruptly.\r\n\r\n'Go on,' she murmured, half aloud. 'That isn't the end.'\r\n\r\nThen the end came very distinctly in a lull between two rain-gusts. Mary\r\nPostgate drew her breath short between her teeth and shivered from head\r\nto foot. '_That's_ all right,' said she contentedly, and went up to the\r\nhouse, where she scandalised the whole routine by taking a luxurious hot\r\nbath before tea, and came down looking, as Miss Fowler said when she saw\r\nher lying all relaxed on the other sofa, 'quite handsome!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE BEGINNINGS\r\n\r\n     It was not part of their blood,\r\n       It came to them very late\r\n     With long arrears to make good,\r\n       When the English began to hate.\r\n\r\n     They were not easily moved,\r\n       They were icy willing to wait\r\n     Till every count should be proved,\r\n       Ere the English began to hate.\r\n\r\n     Their voices were even and low,\r\n       Their eyes were level and straight.\r\n     There was neither sign nor show,\r\n       When the English began to hate.\r\n\r\n     It was not preached to the crowd,\r\n       It was not taught by the State.\r\n     No man spoke it aloud,\r\n       When the English began to hate.\r\n\r\n     It was not suddenly bred,\r\n       It will not swiftly abate,\r\n     Through the chill years ahead,\r\n       When Time shall count from the date\r\n       That the English began to hate.",
