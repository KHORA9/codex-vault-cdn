The cause of this is not far to\r\nseek. Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" appeared in 1859, only four years\r\nearlier, and rapidly had its effect in drawing attention to the great\r\nproblem of the origin of living beings. The theories of Darwin and\r\nWallace brought to a head and presented in a concrete shape the somewhat\r\nvague speculations as to development and evolution which had long been\r\nfloating in the minds of naturalists. In the actual working out of\r\nDarwin's great theory it is impossible to overestimate the influence of\r\nLyell. This is made abundantly clear in Darwin's letters, and it must\r\nnever be forgotten that Darwin himself was a geologist. His training\r\nin this science enabled him to grasp the import of the facts so ably\r\nmarshalled by Lyell in the \"Principles of Geology,\" a work which,\r\nas Professor Judd has clearly shown,* contributed greatly to the\r\nadvancement of evolutionary theory in general. (* Judd \"The Coming of\r\nEvolution\" (\"Cambridge Manuals of Science and Literature\") Cambridge\r\n1910 chapters 6 and 7.)\r\n\r\nFrom a study of the evolution of plants and of the lower animals it was\r\nan easy and obvious transition to man, and this step was soon taken.\r\nSince in his physical structure man shows so close a resemblance to the\r\nhigher animals it was a natural conclusion that the laws governing\r\nthe development of the one should apply also to the other, in spite of\r\npreconceived opinions derived from authority. Unfortunately the times\r\nwere then hardly ripe for a calm and logical treatment of this question:\r\nprejudice in many cases took the place of argument, and the result was\r\ntoo often an undignified squabble instead of a scientific discussion.\r\nHowever, the dogmatism was not by any means all on one side. The\r\ndisciples as usual went farther than the master, and their teaching\r\nwhen pushed to extremities resulted in a peculiarly dreary kind of\r\nmaterialism, a mental attitude which still survives to a certain extent\r\namong scientific and pseudo-scientific men of the old school. In more\r\nRecent times this dogmatic agnosticism of the middle Victorian period\r\nhas been gradually replaced by speculations of a more positive type,\r\nsuch as those of the Mendelian school in biology and the doctrines of\r\nBergson on the philosophical side. With these later developments we are\r\nnot here concerned.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the evolution and history of man as with that of any\r\nother animal, the first step is undoubtedly to collect the facts, and\r\nthis is precisely what Lyell set out to do in the \"Antiquity of\r\nMan.\" The first nineteen chapters of the book are purely an empirical\r\nstatement of the evidence then available as to the existence of man in\r\npre-historic times: the rest of the book is devoted to a consideration\r\nof the connection between the facts previously stated and Darwin's\r\ntheory of the origin of species by variation and natural selection. The\r\nkeynote of Lyell's work, throughout his life, was observation. Lyell was\r\nno cabinet geologist; he went to nature and studied phenomena at first\r\nhand. Possessed of abundant leisure and ample means he travelled far and\r\nwide, patiently collecting material and building up the modern science\r\nof physical geology, whose foundations had been laid by Hutton and\r\nPlayfair. From the facts thus collected he drew his inferences, and if\r\nlater researches showed these inferences to be wrong, unlike some of his\r\ncontemporaries, he never hesitated to say so. Thus and thus only is true\r\nprogress in science attained.\r\n\r\nLyell is universally recognised as the leader of the Uniformitarian\r\nschool of geologists, and it will be well to consider briefly what is\r\nimplied in this term. The principles of Uniformitarianism may be\r\nsummed up thus: THE PRESENT IS THE KEY TO THE PAST. That is to say,\r\nthe processes which have gone on in the past were the same in general\r\ncharacter as those now seen in operation, though probably differing\r\nin degree. This theory is in direct opposition to the ideas of the\r\nCATASTROPHIC school, which were dominant at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century. The catastrophists attributed all past changes to\r\nsudden and violent convulsions of nature, by which all living beings\r\nwere destroyed, to be replaced by a fresh creation. At least such were\r\nthe tenets of the extremists. In opposition to these views the school of\r\nHutton and Lyell introduced the principle of continuity and development.\r\nThere is no discrepancy between Uniformitarianism and evolution. The\r\nidea of Uniformitarianism does not imply that things have always been\r\nthe same; only that they were similar, and between these two terms there\r\nis a wide distinction. Evolution of any kind whatever naturally implies\r\ncontinuity, and this is the fundamental idea of Lyellian geology.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of this clear and definite conception of natural\r\nand organic evolution, in all those parts of his works dealing with\r\nearth-history, with the stratified rocks and with the organisms entombed\r\nin them, Lyell adopted a plan which has now been universally abandoned.\r\nHe began with the most Recent formations and worked backwards from the\r\nknown to the unknown. To modern readers this is perhaps the greatest\r\ndrawback to his work, since it renders difficult the study of events in\r\ntheir actual sequence. However, it must be admitted that, taking into\r\naccount the state of geological knowledge before his time, this course\r\nwas almost inevitable. The succession of the later rocks was fairly well\r\nknown, thanks to the labours of William Smith and others, but in the\r\nlower part of the sequence of stratified rocks there were many gaps, and\r\nmore important still, there was no definite base. Although this want of\r\na starting point has been largely supplied by the labours of Sedgwick,\r\nMurchison, De la Beche, Ramsay, and a host of followers, still\r\nconsiderable doubt prevails as to which constitutes the oldest\r\ntruly stratified series, and the difficulty has only been partially\r\ncircumvented by the adoption of an arbitrary base-line, from which the\r\nsuccession is worked out both upwards and downwards. So the problem\r\nis only removed a stage further back. In the study of human origins a\r\nsimilar difficulty is felt with special acuteness; the beginnings must\r\nof necessity be vague and uncertain, and the farther back we go the\r\nfainter will naturally be the traces of human handiwork and the more\r\nprimitive and doubtful those traces when discovered.\r\n\r\nThe reprinting of the \"Antiquity of Man\" is particularly appropriate at\r\nthe present time, owing to the increased attention drawn to the subject\r\nby recent discoveries. Ever since the publication of the \"Origin of\r\nSpecies\" and the discussions that resulted from that publication, the\r\npopular imagination has been much exercised by the possible existence\r\nof forms intermediate between the apes and man; the so-called \"Missing\r\nLink.\" Much has been written on this subject, some of it well-founded\r\nand some very much the reverse. The discovery of the Neanderthal skull\r\nis fully described in this volume, and this skull is certainly of a low\r\ntype, but it is more human than ape-like. The same remark applies\r\nstill more strongly to the Engis skull, the man of Spy, the recently\r\ndiscovered Sussex skull, and other well-known examples of early human\r\nremains. The Pithecanthropus of Java alone shows perhaps more affinity\r\nto the apes. The whole subject has been most ably discussed by Professor\r\nSollas in his recent book entitled \"Ancient Hunters.\"\r\n\r\nThe study of Palaeolithic flint implements has been raised to a fine\r\nart. Both in England and France a regular succession of primitive types\r\nhas been established and correlated with the gravel terraces of existing\r\nrivers, and even with the deposits of rivers no longer existing and\r\nwith certain glacial deposits. But with all of these the actual bodily\r\nremains of man are comparatively scanty. From this it may be concluded\r\nthat primitive methods of burial were such as to be unfavourable to the\r\nactual preservation of human remains. Attempts have also been made to\r\nprove the existence of man in pre-glacial times, but hitherto none of\r\nthese have met with general acceptance, since in no case is the evidence\r\nbeyond doubt.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important results of recent research in the subject has\r\nbeen the establishment of the existence of man in interglacial times.\r\nWhen Lyell wrote, it was not fully recognised that the glaciation of\r\nEurope was not one continuous process, but that it could be divided into\r\nseveral episodes, glaciations, or advances of the ice, separated by\r\na warm interglacial period. The monumental researches of Penck and\r\nBruckner in the Alps have there established four glaciations with mild\r\ninterglacial periods, but all of these cannot be clearly traced in\r\nBritain. One very important point also is the recognition of the\r\naffinities of certain types of Palaeolithic man to the Eskimo, the\r\nAustralians, and the Bushmen of South Africa. However, it is impossible\r\nto give here a review of the whole subject. Full details of recent\r\nresearches will be found in the works mentioned in the notes at the end\r\nof the book.\r\n\r\nAnother point of great interest and importance, arising directly from\r\nthe study of early man is the nature of the events constituting the\r\nglacial period in Britain and elsewhere. This has been for many years a\r\nfertile subject of controversy, and is likely to continue such. Lyell,\r\nin common with most of the geologists of his day, assumes that during\r\nthe glacial period the British Isles were submerged under the sea to a\r\ndepth of many hundreds of feet, at any rate as regards the region\r\nnorth of a line drawn from London to Bristol. Later authors, however,\r\nexplained the observed phenomena on the hypothesis of a vast ice-sheet\r\nof the Greenland type, descending from the mountains of Scotland\r\nand Scandinavia, filling up the North Sea and spreading over eastern\r\nEngland. This explanation is now accepted by the majority, but it must\r\nbe recognised that it involves enormous mechanical difficulties. It is\r\nimpossible to pursue the subject here; for a full discussion reference\r\nmay be made to Professor Bonney's presidential address to the British\r\nAssociation at Sheffield in 1910.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that the \"Antiquity of Man\" opens up a wide\r\nfield of speculation into a variety of difficult and obscure though\r\ninteresting subjects. In the light of modern research it would be an\r\neasy task to pile up a mountain of criticism on points of detail. But,\r\nthough easy, it would be a thankless task. It is scarcely too much to\r\nsay that the dominant impression of most readers after perusing this\r\nbook will be one of astonishment and admiration at the insight and\r\nbreadth of view displayed by the author. When it was written the subject\r\nwas a particularly thorny one to handle, and it undoubtedly required\r\nmuch courage to tackle the origin and development of the human race from\r\na purely critical and scientific standpoint. It must be admitted on all\r\nhands that the result was eminently successful, taking into account the\r\npaucity of the available material, and the \"Antiquity of Man\" must ever\r\nremain one of the classics of prehistoric archaeology.\r\n\r\nThis edition of the \"Antiquity of Man\" has been undertaken in order to\r\nplace before the public in an easily accessible form one of the best\r\nknown works of the great geologist Sir Charles Lyell; the book had an\r\nimmense influence in its own day, and it still remains one of the best\r\ngeneral accounts of an increasingly important branch of knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid a multiplicity of notes and thus to save space, the\r\nnomenclature has been to a certain extent modernised: a new general\r\ntable of strata has been inserted in the first chapter, in place of the\r\none originally there printed, which was cumbrous and included many minor\r\nsubdivisions of unnecessary minuteness.\r\n\r\nThe notes have been kept as short as possible, and they frequently\r\ncontain little more than references to recent literature elucidating the\r\npoints under discussion in the text.\r\n\r\nR.H.

For the\r\nlast half-century the occasional occurrence in various parts of Europe\r\nof the bones of Man or the works of his hands in cave-breccias and\r\nstalagmites, associated with the remains of the extinct hyaena, bear,\r\nelephant, or rhinoceros, has given rise to a suspicion that the date of\r\nMan must be carried farther back than we had heretofore imagined. On\r\nthe other hand extreme reluctance was naturally felt on the part of\r\nscientific reasoners to admit the validity of such evidence, seeing that\r\nso many caves have been inhabited by a succession of tenants and have\r\nbeen selected by Man as a place not only of domicile, but of sepulture,\r\nwhile some caves have also served as the channels through which the\r\nwaters of occasional land-floods or engulfed rivers have flowed, so that\r\nthe remains of living beings which have peopled the district at more\r\nthan one era may have subsequently been mingled in such caverns and\r\nconfounded together in one and the same deposit. But the facts brought\r\nto light in 1858, during the systematic investigation of the Brixham\r\ncave, near Torquay in Devonshire, which will be described in the sequel,\r\nexcited anew the curiosity of the British public and prepared the way\r\nfor a general admission that scepticism in regard to the bearing of cave\r\nevidence in favour of the antiquity of Man had previously been pushed to\r\nan extreme.\r\n\r\nSince that period many of the facts formerly adduced in favour of the\r\nco-existence in ancient times of Man with certain species of mammalia\r\nlong since extinct have been re-examined in England and on the\r\nContinent, and new cases bearing on the same question, whether relating\r\nto caves or to alluvial strata in valleys, have been brought to light.\r\nTo qualify myself for the appreciation and discussion of these cases,\r\nI have visited in the course of the last three years many parts of\r\nEngland, France, and Belgium, and have communicated personally or by\r\nletter with not a few of the geologists, English and foreign, who have\r\ntaken part in these researches. Besides explaining in the present volume\r\nthe results of this inquiry, I shall give a description of the glacial\r\nformations of Europe and North America, that I may allude to the\r\ntheories entertained respecting their origin, and consider their\r\nprobable relations in a chronological point of view to the human epoch,\r\nand why throughout a great part of the northern hemisphere they so often\r\ninterpose an abrupt barrier to all attempts to trace farther back into\r\nthe past the signs of the existence of Man upon the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the concluding chapters I shall offer a few remarks on the recent\r\nmodifications of the Lamarckian theory of progressive development and\r\ntransmutation, which are suggested by Mr. Darwin's work on the \"Origin\r\nof Species by Variation and Natural Selection,\" and the bearing of this\r\nhypothesis on the different races of mankind and their connection with\r\nother parts of the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOMENCLATURE.\r\n\r\nSome preliminary explanation of the nomenclature adopted in the\r\nfollowing pages will be indispensable, that the meaning attached to\r\nthe terms Recent, Pleistocene, and Post-Tertiary may be correctly\r\nunderstood. [1]\r\n\r\nPreviously to the year 1833, when I published the third volume of the\r\n\"Principles of Geology,\" the strata called Tertiary had been divided\r\nby geologists into Lower, Middle, and Upper; the Lower comprising the\r\noldest formations of the environs of Paris and London, with others of\r\nlike age; the Middle, those of Bordeaux and Touraine; and the Upper, all\r\nthat lay above or were newer than the last-mentioned group.\r\n\r\nWhen engaged in 1828 in preparing for the press the treatise on geology\r\nabove alluded to, I conceived the idea of classing the whole of this\r\nseries of strata according to the different degrees of affinity\r\nwhich their fossil testacea bore to the living fauna. Having obtained\r\ninformation on this subject during my travels on the Continent, I learnt\r\nthat M. Deshayes of Paris, already celebrated as a conchologist, had\r\nbeen led independently by the study of a large collection of Recent\r\nand fossil shells to very similar views respecting the possibility of\r\narranging the Tertiary formations in chronological order, according to\r\nthe proportional number of species of shells identical with living ones,\r\nwhich characterised each of the successive groups above mentioned. After\r\ncomparing 3000 fossil species with 5000 living ones, the result arrived\r\nat was, that in the lower Tertiary strata there were about 3 1/2 per\r\ncent identical with Recent; in the middle Tertiary (the faluns of the\r\nLoire and Gironde), about 17 per cent; and in the upper tertiary, from\r\n35 to 50, and sometimes in the most modern beds as much as 90 to 95 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clearness and brevity, I proposed to give short\r\ntechnical names to these sets of strata, or the periods to which they\r\nrespectively belonged. I called the first or oldest of them Eocene, the\r\nsecond Miocene, and the third Pliocene. The first of the above terms,\r\nEocene, is derived from Greek eos, dawn, and Greek kainos, recent;\r\nbecause an extremely small proportion of the fossil shells of this\r\nperiod could be referred to living species, so that this era seemed to\r\nindicate the dawn of the present testaceous fauna, no living species of\r\nshells having been detected in the antecedent or Secondary rocks.\r\n\r\nSome conchologists are now unwilling to allow that any Eocene species of\r\nshell has really survived to our times so unaltered as to allow of its\r\nspecific identification with a living species. I cannot enter in this\r\nplace into this wide controversy. It is enough at present to remark\r\nthat the character of the Eocene fauna, as contrasted with that of the\r\nantecedent Secondary formations, wears a very modern aspect, and that\r\nsome able living conchologists still maintain that there are Eocene\r\nshells not specifically distinguishable from those now extant; though\r\nthey may be fewer in number than was supposed in 1833.\r\n\r\nThe term Miocene (from Greek meion, less; and Greek kainos, recent) is\r\nintended to express a minor proportion of Recent species (of testacea);\r\nthe term Pliocene (from Greek pleion, more; and Greek kainos, recent), a\r\ncomparative plurality of the same.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been objected to this nomenclature that certain species\r\nof infusoria found in the chalk are still existing, and, on the other\r\nhand, the Miocene and Older Pliocene deposits often contain the remains\r\nof mammalia, reptiles, and fish, exclusively of extinct species. But the\r\nreader must bear in mind that the terms Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene\r\nwere originally invented with reference purely to conchological data,\r\nand in that sense have always been and are still used by me.\r\n\r\nSince the first introduction of the terms above defined, the number of\r\nnew living species of shells obtained from different parts of the globe\r\nhas been exceedingly great, supplying fresh data for comparison, and\r\nenabling the palaeontologist to correct many erroneous identifications\r\nof fossil and Recent forms. New species also have been collected in\r\nabundance from Tertiary formations of every age, while newly discovered\r\ngroups of strata have filled up gaps in the previously known\r\nseries. Hence modifications and reforms have been called for in the\r\nclassifications first proposed. The Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene\r\nperiods have been made to comprehend certain sets of strata of which the\r\nfossils do not always conform strictly in the proportion of Recent to\r\nextinct species with the definitions first given by me, or which are\r\nimplied in the etymology of those terms. These innovations have been\r\ntreated of in my \"Elements or Manual of Elementary Geology,\" and in the\r\nSupplement to the fifth edition of the same, published in 1859,\r\nwhere some modifications of my classification, as first proposed, are\r\nintroduced; but I need not dwell on these on the present occasion, as\r\nthe only formations with which we shall be concerned in the present\r\nvolume are those of the most modern date, or the Post-Tertiary. It\r\nwill be convenient to divide these into two groups, the Recent and the\r\nPleistocene. In the Recent we may comprehend those deposits in which not\r\nonly all the shells but all the fossil mammalia are of living species;\r\nin the Pleistocene those strata in which, the shells being Recent,\r\na portion, and often a considerable one, of the accompanying fossil\r\nquadrupeds belongs to extinct species.\r\n\r\nCases will occur where it may be scarcely possible to draw the line of\r\ndemarcation between the Newer Pliocene and Pleistocene, or between the\r\nlatter and the recent deposits; and we must expect these difficulties to\r\nincrease rather than diminish with every advance in our knowledge, and\r\nin proportion as gaps are filled up in the series of geological records.\r\n\r\nThe annexed tabular view (Table 1/1) of the whole series of\r\nfossiliferous strata will enable the reader to see at a glance the\r\nchronological relation of the Recent and Pleistocene to the antecedent\r\nperiods.

Of late years, since I first alluded\r\nto the subject, more extensive investigations have been made into the\r\nhistory of the Danish peat-mosses. Of the results of these inquiries\r\nI shall give a brief abstract in the present chapter, that we may\r\nafterwards compare them with deposits of older date, which throw light\r\non the antiquity of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of peat in Denmark,* varying in depth from 10 to 30 feet,\r\nhave been formed in hollows or depressions in the northern drift or\r\nboulder formation hereafter to be described. (* An excellent account of\r\nthese researches of Danish naturalists and antiquaries has been drawn\r\nup by an able Swiss geologist, M.A. Morlot, and will be found in the\r\n\"Bulletin de la Societe Vaudoise des Sci. Nat.\" tome 6 Lausanne 1860.)\r\nThe lowest stratum, 2 to 3 feet thick, consists of swamp-peat composed\r\nchiefly of moss or sphagnum, above which lies another growth of peat,\r\nnot made up exclusively of aquatic or swamp plants. Around the borders\r\nof the bogs, and at various depths in them, lie trunks of trees,\r\nespecially of the Scotch fir (Pinus sylvestris), often 3 feet in\r\ndiameter, which must have grown on the margin of the peat-mosses, and\r\nhave frequently fallen into them. This tree is not now, nor has ever\r\nbeen in historical times, a native of the Danish Islands, and when\r\nintroduced there has not thriven; yet it was evidently indigenous in the\r\nhuman period, for Steenstrup has taken out with his own hands a flint\r\ninstrument from below a buried trunk of one of these pines. It appears\r\nclear that the same Scotch fir was afterwards supplanted by the sessile\r\nvariety of the common oak, of which many prostrate trunks occur in the\r\npeat at higher levels than the pines; and still higher the pedunculated\r\nvariety of the same oak (Quercus robur, L.) occurs with the alder, birch\r\n(Betula verrucosa, Ehrh.), and hazel. The oak has now in its turn been\r\nalmost superseded in Denmark by the common beech. Other trees, such as\r\nthe white birch (Betula alba), characterise the lower part of the\r\nbogs, and disappear from the higher; while others again, like the aspen\r\n(Populus tremula), occur at all levels, and still flourish in Denmark.\r\nAll the land and freshwater shells, and all the mammalia as well as the\r\nplants, whose remains occur buried in the Danish peat, are of Recent\r\nspecies. [3]\r\n\r\nIt has been stated, that a stone implement was found under a buried\r\nScotch fir at a great depth in the peat. By collecting and studying a\r\nvast variety of such implements, and other articles of human workmanship\r\npreserved in peat and in sand-dunes on the coast, as also in certain\r\nshell-mounds of the aborigines presently to be described, the Danish\r\nand Swedish antiquaries and naturalists, MM. Nilsson, Steenstrup,\r\nForchhammer, Thomsen, Worsaae, and others, have succeeded in\r\nestablishing a chronological succession of periods, which they have\r\ncalled the ages of stone, of bronze, and of iron, named from the\r\nmaterials which have each in their turn served for the fabrication of\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\nThe age of stone in Denmark coincided with the period of the first\r\nvegetation, or that of the Scotch fir, and in part at least with the\r\nsecond vegetation, or that of the oak. But a considerable portion of the\r\noak epoch coincided with \"the age of bronze,\" for swords and shields of\r\nthat metal, now in the Museum of Copenhagen, have been taken out of peat\r\nin which oaks abound. The age of iron corresponded more nearly with that\r\nof the beech tree.*\r\n\r\n     (* Morlot \"Bulletin de la Societe Vaudoise des Sci. Nat.\"\r\n     tome 6 page 292.) [4]\r\n\r\nM. Morlot, to whom we are indebted for a masterly sketch of the recent\r\nprogress of this new line of research, followed up with so much success\r\nin Scandinavia and Switzerland, observes that the introduction of the\r\nfirst tools made of bronze among a people previously ignorant of the use\r\nof metals, implies a great advance in the arts, for bronze is an alloy\r\nof about nine parts of copper and one of tin; and although the former\r\nmetal, copper, is by no means rare, and is occasionally found pure or\r\nin a native state, tin is not only scarce but never occurs native. To\r\ndetect the existence of this metal in its ore, then to disengage it\r\nfrom the matrix, and finally, after blending it in due proportion with\r\ncopper, to cast the fused mixture in a mould, allowing time for it to\r\nacquire hardness by slow cooling, all this bespeaks no small sagacity\r\nand skilful manipulation. Accordingly, the pottery found associated with\r\nweapons of bronze is of a more ornamental and tasteful style than any\r\nwhich belongs to the age of stone. Some of the moulds in which the\r\nbronze instruments were cast, and \"tags,\" as they are called, of bronze,\r\nwhich are formed in the hole through which the fused metal was poured,\r\nhave been found. The number and variety of objects belonging to the age\r\nof bronze indicates its long duration, as does the progress in the arts\r\nimplied by the rudeness of the earlier tools, often mere repetitions\r\nof those of the stone age, as contrasted with the more skilfully worked\r\nweapons of a later stage of the same period.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that an age of copper must always have intervened\r\nbetween that of stone and bronze; but if so, the interval seems to have\r\nbeen short in Europe, owing apparently to the territory occupied by the\r\naboriginal inhabitants having been invaded and conquered by a people\r\ncoming from the East, to whom the use of swords, spears, and other\r\nweapons of bronze was familiar. Hatchets, however, of copper have been\r\nfound in the Danish peat.\r\n\r\nThe next stage of improvement, or that manifested by the substitution of\r\niron for bronze, indicates another stride in the progress of the arts.\r\nIron never presents itself, except in meteorites, in a native state,\r\nso that to recognise its ores, and then to separate the metal from its\r\nmatrix, demands no inconsiderable exercise of the powers of observation\r\nand invention. To fuse the ore requires an intense heat, not to be\r\nobtained without artificial appliances, such as pipes inflated by the\r\nhuman breath, or bellows, or some other suitable machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANISH SHELL-MOUNDS, OR KJOKKENMODDING.*\r\n\r\n     (* Mr. John Lubbock published, after these sheets were\r\n     written, an able paper on the Danish \"Shell-mounds\" in the\r\n     October number of the \"Natural History Review\" 1861 page\r\n     489, in which he has described the results of a recent visit\r\n     to Denmark, made by him in company with Mr. Busk.)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the peat-mosses, another class of memorials found in\r\nDenmark has thrown light on the pre-historical age. At certain points\r\nalong the shores of nearly all the Danish islands, mounds may be seen,\r\nconsisting chiefly of thousands of cast-away shells of the oyster,\r\ncockle, and other molluscs of the same species as those which are now\r\neaten by Man. These shells are plentifully mixed up with the bones of\r\nvarious quadrupeds, birds, and fish, which served as the food of the\r\nrude hunters and fishers by whom the mounds were accumulated. I have\r\nseen similar large heaps of oysters, and other marine shells with\r\ninterspersed stone implements, near the seashore, both in Massachusetts\r\nand in Georgia, U.S.A., left by the native North American Indians at\r\npoints near to which they were in the habit of pitching their wigwams\r\nfor centuries before the white man arrived.\r\n\r\nSuch accumulations are called by the Danes, Kjokkenmodding, or\r\n\"kitchen-middens.\" Scattered all through them are flint knives,\r\nhatchets, and other instruments of stone, horn, wood, and bone, with\r\nfragments of coarse pottery, mixed with charcoal and cinders, but never\r\nany implements of bronze, still less of iron. The stone hatchets and\r\nknives had been sharpened by rubbing, and in this respect are one degree\r\nless rude than those of an older date, associated in France with the\r\nbones of extinct mammalia, of which more in the sequel. The mounds vary\r\nin height from 3 to 10 feet, and in area are some of them 1000 feet\r\nlong, and from 150 to 200 wide. They are rarely placed more than 10\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, and are confined to its immediate\r\nneighbourhood, or if not (and there are cases where they are several\r\nmiles from the shore), the distance is ascribable to the entrance of a\r\nsmall stream, which has deposited sediment, or to the growth of a peaty\r\nswamp, by which the land has been made to advance on the Baltic, as it\r\nis still doing in many places, aided, according to Puggaard, by a very\r\nslow upheaval of the whole country at the rate of 2 or 3 inches in a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThere is also another geographical fact equally in favour of the\r\nantiquity of the mounds, namely, that they are wanting on those parts of\r\nthe coast which border the Western Ocean, or exactly where the waves are\r\nnow slowly eating away the land. There is every reason to presume that\r\noriginally there were stations along the coast of the North Sea as well\r\nas that of the Baltic, but by the gradual undermining of the cliffs they\r\nhave all been swept away.\r\n\r\nAnother striking proof, perhaps the most conclusive of all, that the\r\n\"kitchen-middens\" are very old, is derived from the character of their\r\nembedded shells. These consist entirely of living species; but, in the\r\nfirst place, the common eatable oyster is among them, attaining its\r\nfull size, whereas the same Ostrea edulis cannot live at present in the\r\nbrackish waters of the Baltic except near its entrance, where, whenever\r\na north-westerly gale prevails, a current setting in from the ocean\r\npours in a great body of salt water. Yet it seems that during the whole\r\ntime of the accumulation of the \"kitchen-middens\" the oyster flourished\r\nin places from which it is now excluded. In like manner the eatable\r\ncockle, mussel, and periwinkle (Cardium edule, Mytilus edulis, and\r\nLittorina littorea), which are met with in great numbers in the\r\n\"middens,\" are of the ordinary dimensions which they acquire in the\r\nocean, whereas the same species now living in the adjoining parts of\r\nthe Baltic only attain a third of their natural size, being stunted and\r\ndwarfed in their growth by the quantity of fresh water poured by rivers\r\ninto that inland sea.*\r\n\r\n     (* See \"Principles of Geology\" chapter 30.)\r\n\r\nHence we may confidently infer that in the days of the aboriginal\r\nhunters and fishers, the ocean had freer access than now to the Baltic,\r\ncommunicating probably through the peninsula of Jutland, Jutland having\r\nbeen at no remote period an archipelago. Even in the course of the\r\nnineteenth century, the salt waters have made one irruption into the\r\nBaltic by the Lymfiord, although they have been now again excluded. It\r\nis also affirmed that other channels were open in historical times which\r\nare now silted up.*\r\n\r\n     (* See Morlot \"Bulletin de la Societe Vaudoise des Sci.\r\n     Nat.\" tome 6.)\r\n\r\nIf we next turn to the remains of vertebrata preserved in the mounds,\r\nwe find that here also, as in the Danish peat-mosses, all the quadrupeds\r\nbelong to species known to have inhabited Europe within the memory of\r\nMan. No remains of the mammoth, or rhinoceros, or of any extinct\r\nspecies appear, except those of the wild bull (Bos urus, Linn., or Bos\r\nprimigenius, Bojanus), which are in such numbers as to prove that the\r\nspecies was a favourite food of the ancient people. But as this animal\r\nwas seen by Julius Caesar, and survived long after his time, its\r\npresence alone would not go far to prove the mounds to be of high\r\nantiquity. The Lithuanian aurochs or bison (Bos bison, L., Bos priscus,\r\nBoj.), which has escaped extirpation only because protected by the\r\nRussian Czars, surviving in one forest in Lithuania) has not yet been\r\nmet with, but will no doubt be detected hereafter, as it has been\r\nalready found in the Danish peat. The beaver, long since destroyed in\r\nDenmark, occurs frequently, as does the seal (Phoca Gryppus, Fab.), now\r\nvery rare on the Danish coast. With these are mingled bones of the red\r\ndeer and roe, but the reindeer has not yet been found. There are also\r\nthe bones of many carnivora, such as the lynx, fox, and wolf, but no\r\nsigns of any domesticated animals except the dog. The long bones of the\r\nlarger mammalia have been all broken as if by some instrument, in such\r\na manner as to allow of the extraction of the marrow, and the gristly\r\nparts have been gnawed off, as if by dogs, to whose agency is also\r\nattributed the almost entire absence of the bones of young birds and of\r\nthe smaller bones and softer parts of the skeletons of birds in general,\r\neven of those of large size. In reference to the latter, it has been\r\nproved experimentally by Professor Steenstrup, that if the same species\r\nof birds are now given to dogs, they will devour those parts of the\r\nskeleton which are missing, and leave just those which are preserved in\r\nthe old \"kitchen-middens.\"\r\n\r\nThe dogs of the mounds, the only domesticated animals, are of a smaller\r\nrace than those of the bronze period, as shown by the peat-mosses, and\r\nthe dogs of the bronze age are inferior in size and strength to those\r\nof the iron age. The domestic ox, horse, and sheep, which are wanting\r\nin the mounds, are confined to that part of the Danish peat which was\r\nformed in the ages of bronze and iron.\r\n\r\nAmong the bones of birds, scarcely any are more frequent in the mounds\r\nthan those of the auk (Alca impennis), now extinct. The Capercailzie\r\n(Tetrao urogallus) is also met with, and may, it is suggested, have fed\r\non the buds of the Scotch fir in times when that tree flourished around\r\nthe peat-bogs. The different stages of growth of the roedeer's horns,\r\nand the presence of the wild swan, now only a winter visitor, have\r\nbeen appealed to as proving that the aborigines resided in the same\r\nsettlements all the year round. That they also ventured out to sea in\r\ncanoes such as are now found in the peat-mosses, hollowed out of the\r\ntrunk of a single tree, to catch fish far from land, is testified by the\r\nbony relics of several deep-sea species, such as the herring, cod, and\r\nflounder. The ancient people were not cannibals, for no human bones\r\nare mingled with the spoils of the chase. Skulls, however, have been\r\nobtained not only from peat, but from tumuli of the stone period\r\nbelieved to be contemporaneous with the mounds. These skulls are small\r\nand round, and have a prominent ridge over the orbits of the eyes,\r\nshowing that the ancient race was of small stature, with round heads and\r\noverhanging eyebrows--in short, they bore a considerable resemblance to\r\nthe modern Laplanders. The human skulls of the bronze age found in the\r\nDanish peat, and those of the iron period, are of an elongated form and\r\nlarger size. There appear to be very few well-authenticated examples\r\nof crania referable to the bronze period--a circumstance no doubt\r\nattributable to the custom prevalent among the people of that era of\r\nburning their dead and collecting their bones in funeral urns.\r\n\r\nNo traces of grain of any sort have hitherto been discovered, nor\r\nany other indication that the ancient people had any knowledge of\r\nagriculture. The only vegetable remains in the mounds are burnt pieces\r\nof wood and some charred substance referred by Dr. Forchhammer to the\r\nZostera marina, a sea plant which was perhaps used in the production of\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nWhat may be the antiquity of the earliest human remains preserved in\r\nthe Danish peat cannot be estimated in centuries with any approach\r\nto accuracy. In the first place, in going back to the bronze age, we\r\nalready find ourselves beyond the reach of history or even of tradition.\r\nIn the time of the Romans the Danish Isles were covered, as now, with\r\nmagnificent beech forests. Nowhere in the world does this tree flourish\r\nmore luxuriantly than in Denmark, and eighteen centuries seem to have\r\ndone little or nothing towards modifying the character of the forest\r\nvegetation. Yet in the antecedent bronze period there were no beech\r\ntrees, or at most but a few stragglers, the country being then covered\r\nwith oak. In the age of stone again, the Scotch fir prevailed, and\r\nalready there were human inhabitants in those old pine forests. How many\r\ngenerations of each species of tree flourished in succession before the\r\npine was supplanted by the oak, and the oak by the beech, can be but\r\nvaguely conjectured, but the minimum of time required for the formation\r\nof so much peat must, according to the estimate of Steenstrup and other\r\ngood authorities, have amounted to at least 4000 years; and there\r\nis nothing in the observed rate of the growth of peat opposed to the\r\nconclusion that the number of centuries may not have been four times as\r\ngreat, even though the signs of Man's existence have not yet been traced\r\ndown to the lowest or amorphous stratum. As to the \"kitchen-middens,\"\r\nthey correspond in date to the older portion of the peaty record, or to\r\nthe earliest part of the age of stone as known in Denmark.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT SWISS LAKE-DWELLINGS, BUILT ON PILES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 1. Swiss Lake-Dwellings]\r\n\r\nIn the shallow parts of many Swiss lakes, where there is a depth of no\r\nmore than from 5 to 15 feet of water, ancient wooden piles are observed\r\nat the bottom sometimes worn down to the surface of the mud, sometimes\r\nprojecting slightly above it. These have evidently once supported\r\nvillages, nearly all of them of unknown date, but the most ancient of\r\nwhich certainly belonged to the age of stone, for hundreds of implements\r\nresembling those of the Danish shell-mounds and peat-mosses have been\r\ndredged up from the mud into which the piles were driven.\r\n\r\nThe earliest historical account of such habitations is that given by\r\nHerodotus of a Thracian tribe, who dwelt, in the year 520 B.C., in\r\nPrasias, a small mountain-lake of Paeonia, now part of modern Roumelia.*\r\n\r\n     (* Herodotus lib. 5 cap. 16. Rediscovered by M. de Ville\r\n     \"Natural History Review\" volume 2 1862 page 486.)\r\n\r\nTheir habitations were constructed on platforms raised above the lake,\r\nand resting on piles. They were connected with the shore by a narrow\r\ncauseway of similar formation. Such platforms must have been of\r\nconsiderable extent, for the Paeonians lived there with their families\r\nand horses. Their food consisted largely of the fish which the lake\r\nproduced in abundance.\r\n\r\nIn rude and unsettled times, such insular sites afforded safe retreats,\r\nall communication with the mainland being cut off, except by boats, or\r\nby such wooden bridges as could be easily removed.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss lake-dwellings seem first to have attracted attention during\r\nthe dry winter of 1853-54, when the lakes and rivers sank lower than had\r\never been previously known, and when the inhabitants of Meilen, on the\r\nLake of Zurich, resolved to raise the level of some ground and turn it\r\ninto land, by throwing mud upon it obtained by dredging in the adjoining\r\nshallow water. During these dredging operations they discovered a number\r\nof wooden piles deeply driven into the bed of the lake, and among them\r\na great many hammers, axes, celts, and other instruments. All these\r\nbelonged to the stone period with two exceptions, namely, an armlet of\r\nthin brass wire, and a small bronze hatchet.\r\n\r\nFragments of rude pottery fashioned by the hand were abundant, also\r\nmasses of charred wood, supposed to have formed parts of the platform\r\non which the wooden cabins were built. Of this burnt timber, on this and\r\nother sites, subsequently explored, there was such an abundance as to\r\nlead to the conclusion that many of the settlements must have perished\r\nby fire. Herodotus has recorded that the Paeonians, above alluded to,\r\npreserved their independence during the Persian invasion, and defied the\r\nattacks of Darius by aid of the peculiar position of their dwellings.\r\n\"But their safety,\" observes Mr. Wylie,* \"was probably owing to their\r\nliving in the middle of the lake, (Greek) en mese te limne, whereas the\r\nancient Swiss settlers were compelled by the rapidly increasing depth of\r\nthe water near the margins of their lakes to construct their habitations\r\nat a short distance from the shore, within easy bowshot of the land, and\r\ntherefore not out of reach of fiery projectiles, against which thatched\r\nroofs and wooden walls could present but a poor defence.\"\r\n\r\n     (* W.M. Wylie \"Archaeologia\" volume 38 1859, a valuable\r\n     paper on the Swiss and Irish lake-habitations.)\r\n\r\nTo these circumstances and to accidental fires we are probably indebted\r\nfor the frequent preservation, in the mud around the site of the old\r\nsettlements, of the most precious tools and works of art, such as would\r\nnever have been thrown into the Danish \"kitchen-middens,\" which have\r\nbeen aptly compared to a modern dusthole.\r\n\r\nDr. Ferdinand Keller of Zurich has drawn up a series of most instructive\r\nmemoirs, illustrated with well-executed plates, of the treasures\r\nin stone, bronze, and bone brought to light in these subaqueous\r\nrepositories, and has given an ideal restoration of part of one of the\r\nold villages (see Plate 1 above),* such as he conceives may have existed\r\non the lakes of Zurich and Bienne.\r\n\r\n     (*Keller \"Pfahlbauten, Antiquarische Gesellschaft in Zurich\"\r\n     Bd. 12 and 13 1858-1861. In the fifth number of the \"Natural\r\n     History Review\" January 9, 1862, Mr. Lubbock has published\r\n     an excellent account of the works of the Swiss writers on\r\n     their lake-habitations.)\r\n\r\nIn this view, however, he has not simply trusted to his imagination,\r\nbut has availed himself of a sketch published by M. Dumont d'Urville, of\r\nsimilar habitations of the Papuans in New Guinea in the Bay of Dorei. It\r\nis also stated by Dr. Keller, that on the River Limmat, near Zurich, so\r\nlate as the last century, there were several fishing-huts constructed on\r\nthis same plan.*\r\n\r\n     (* Keller \"Pfahlbauten, Antiquarische Gesellschaft in\r\n     Zurich\" Bd. 9 page 81 note.)\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked that one of the cabins is represented as circular.\r\nThat such was the form of many in Switzerland is inferred from the\r\nshape of pieces of clay which lined the interior, and which owe their\r\npreservation apparently to their having been hardened by fire when the\r\nvillage was burnt. In the sketch (Plate 1), some fishing-nets are seen\r\nspread out to dry on the wooden platform. The Swiss archaeologist has\r\nfound abundant evidence of fishing-gear, consisting of pieces of cord,\r\nhooks, and stones used as weights. A canoe also is introduced, such as\r\nare occasionally met with. One of these, made of the trunk of a single\r\ntree, fifty feet long and three and a half feet wide, was found capsized\r\nat the bottom of the Lake of Bienne. It appears to have been laden\r\nwith stones, such as were used to raise the foundation of some of the\r\nartificial islands.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that as many as 300 wooden huts were sometimes comprised\r\nin one settlement, and that they may have contained about 1000\r\ninhabitants. At Wangen, M. Lohle has calculated that 40,000 piles were\r\nused, probably not all planted at one time nor by one generation. Among\r\nthe works of great merit devoted specially to a description of the Swiss\r\nlake-habitations is that of M. Troyon, published in 1860.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Sur les Habitations lacustres.\")\r\n\r\nThe number of sites which he and other authors have already enumerated\r\nin Switzerland is truly wonderful. They occur on the large lakes of\r\nConstance, Zurich, Geneva, and Neufchatel, and on most of the smaller\r\nones. Some are exclusively of the stone age, others of the bronze\r\nperiod. Of these last more than twenty are spoken of on the Lake of\r\nGeneva alone, more than forty on that of Neufchatel, and twenty on the\r\nsmall Lake of Bienne.\r\n\r\nOne of the sites first studied by the Swiss antiquaries was the small\r\nlake of Moosseedorf, near Berne, where implements of stone, horn, and\r\nbone, but none of metal, were obtained. Although the flint here employed\r\nmust have come from a distance (probably from the south of France), the\r\nchippings of the material are in such profusion as to imply that there\r\nwas a manufactory of implements on the spot. Here also, as in several\r\nother settlements, hatchets and wedges of jade have been observed of a\r\nkind said not to occur in Switzerland or the adjoining parts of Europe,\r\nand which some mineralogists would fain derive from the East; amber\r\nalso, which, it is supposed, was imported from the shores of the Baltic.\r\n\r\nAt Wangen near Stein, on the Lake of Constance, another of the most\r\nancient of the lake-dwellings, hatchets of serpentine and greenstone,\r\nand arrow-heads of quartz have been met with. Here also remains of a\r\nkind of cloth, supposed to be of flax, not woven but plaited, have\r\nbeen detected. Professor Heer has recognised lumps of carbonised wheat,\r\nTriticum vulgare, and grains of another kind, T. dicoccum, and barley,\r\nHordeum distichum, and flat round cakes of bread; and at Robbenhausen\r\nand elsewhere Hordeum hexastichum in fine ears, the same kind of barley\r\nwhich is found associated with Egyptian mummies, showing clearly that in\r\nthe stone period the lake-dwellers cultivated all these cereals, besides\r\nhaving domesticated the dog, the ox, the sheep, and the goat.\r\n\r\nCarbonised apples and pears of small size, such as still grow in the\r\nSwiss forests, stones of the wild plum, seeds of the raspberry and\r\nblackberry, and beech-nuts, also occur in the mud, and hazel-nuts in\r\ngreat plenty.\r\n\r\nNear Morges, on the Lake of Geneva, a settlement of the bronze period,\r\nno less than forty hatchets of that metal have been dredged up, and in\r\nmany other localities the number and variety of weapons and utensils\r\ndiscovered, in a fine state of preservation, is truly astonishing.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that as yet all the settlements of the bronze period\r\nare confined to Western and Central Switzerland. In the more eastern\r\nlakes those of the stone period alone have as yet been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe tools, ornaments, and pottery of the bronze period in Switzerland\r\nbear a close resemblance to those of corresponding age in Denmark,\r\nattesting the wide spread of a uniform civilisation over Central Europe\r\nat that era. In some few of the Swiss aquatic stations a mixture of\r\nbronze and iron implements has been observed, but no coins. At Tiefenau,\r\nnear Berne, in ground supposed to have been a battle-field, coins\r\nand medals of bronze and silver, struck at Marseilles, and of Greek\r\nmanufacture, and iron swords, have been found, all belonging to the\r\nfirst and pre-Roman division of the age of iron.\r\n\r\nIn the settlements of the bronze era the wooden piles are not so much\r\ndecayed as those of the stone period; the latter having wasted down\r\nquite to the level of the mud, whereas the piles of the bronze age (as\r\nin the Lake of Bienne, for example) still project above it.\r\n\r\nProfessor Rutimeyer of Basle, well-known to palaeontologists as the\r\nauthor of several important memoirs on fossil vertebrata, has recently\r\npublished a scientific description of great interest of the animal\r\nremains dredged up at various stations where they had been embedded for\r\nages in the mud into which the piles were driven.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Die Fauna der Pfahlbauten in der Schweiz\" Basel 1861.)\r\n\r\nThese bones bear the same relation to the primitive inhabitants of\r\nSwitzerland and some of their immediate successors as do the contents of\r\nthe Danish \"kitchen-middens\" to the ancient fishing and hunting tribes\r\nwho lived on the shores of the Baltic.\r\n\r\nThe list of wild mammalia enumerated in this excellent treatise contains\r\nno less than twenty-four species, exclusive of several domesticated\r\nones: besides which there are eighteen species of birds, the wild swan,\r\ngoose, and two species of ducks being among them; also three reptiles,\r\nincluding the eatable frog and freshwater tortoise; and lastly, nine\r\nspecies of freshwater fish. All these (amounting to fifty-four species)\r\nare with one exception still living in Europe. The exception is the wild\r\nbull (Bos primigenius), which, as before stated, survived in historical\r\ntimes. The following are the mammalia alluded to:--The bear (Ursus\r\narctos), the badger, the common marten, the polecat, the ermine, the\r\nweasel, the otter, wolf, fox, wild cat, hedgehog, squirrel, field-mouse\r\n(Mus sylvaticus), hare, beaver, hog (comprising two races, namely, the\r\nwild boar and swamp-hog), the stag (Cervus elaphus), the roe-deer,\r\nthe fallow-deer, the elk, the steinbock (Capra ibex), the chamois, the\r\nLithuanian bison, and the wild bull. The domesticated species comprise\r\nthe dog, horse, ass, pig, goat, sheep, and several bovine races.\r\n\r\nThe greater number, if not all, of these animals served for food, and\r\nall the bones which contained marrow have been split open in the same\r\nway as the corresponding ones found in the shell-mounds of Denmark\r\nbefore mentioned. The bones both of the wild bull and the bison are\r\ninvariably split in this manner. As a rule, the lower jaws with teeth\r\noccur in greater abundance than any other parts of the skeleton--a\r\ncircumstance which, geologists know, holds good in regard to fossil\r\nmammalia of all periods. As yet the reindeer is missing in the Swiss\r\nlake-settlements as in the Danish \"kitchen-middens,\" although this\r\nanimal in more ancient times ranged over France, together with the\r\nmammoth, as far south as the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nA careful comparison of the bones from different sites has shown that\r\nin settlements such as Wangen and Moosseedorf, belonging to the earliest\r\nage of stone, when the habits of the hunter state predominated over\r\nthose of the pastoral, venison, or the flesh of the stag and roe, was\r\nmore eaten than the flesh of the domestic cattle and sheep. This was\r\nafterwards reversed in the later stone period and in the age of bronze.\r\nAt that later period also the tame pig, which is wanting in some of the\r\noldest stations, had replaced the wild boar as a common article of\r\nfood. In the beginning of the age of stone, in Switzerland, the goats\r\noutnumbered the sheep, but towards the close of the same period the\r\nsheep were more abundant than the goats.\r\n\r\nThe fox in the first era was very common, but it nearly disappears in\r\nthe bronze age, during which period a large hunting-dog, supposed to\r\nhave been imported into Switzerland from some foreign country, becomes\r\nthe chief representative of the canine genus.\r\n\r\nA single fragment of the bone of a hare (Lepus timidus) has been found\r\nat Moosseedorf. The almost universal absence of this quadruped is\r\nsupposed to imply that the Swiss lake-dwellers were prevented from\r\neating that animal by the same superstition which now prevails among\r\nthe Laplanders, and which Julius Caesar found in full force amongst the\r\nancient Britons.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Commentaries\" lib 5 chapter 12.)\r\n\r\nThat the lake-dwellers should have fed so largely on the fox, while\r\nthey abstained from touching the hare, establishes, says Rutimeyer, a\r\nsingular contrast between their tastes and ours.\r\n\r\nEven in the earliest settlements, as already hinted, several\r\ndomesticated animals occur, namely, the ox, sheep, goat, and dog. Of the\r\nthree last, each was represented by one race only; but there were two\r\nraces of cattle, the most common being of small size, and called by\r\nRutimeyer Bos brachyceros (Bos longifrons, Owen), or the marsh cow,\r\nthe other derived from the wild bull; though, as no skull has yet been\r\ndiscovered, this identification is not so certain as could be wished.\r\nIt is, however, beyond question that at a later era, namely, towards the\r\nclose of the stone and beginning of the bronze period, the lake-dwellers\r\nhad succeeded in taming that formidable brute the Bos primigenius, the\r\nUrus of Caesar, which he described as very fierce, swift, and strong,\r\nand scarcely inferior to the elephant in size. In a tame state its\r\nbones were somewhat less massive and heavy, and its horns were somewhat\r\nsmaller than in wild individuals. Still in its domesticated form, it\r\nrivalled in dimensions the largest living cattle, those of Friesland,\r\nin North Holland, for example. When most abundant, as at Concise on\r\nthe Lake of Neufchatel, it had nearly superseded the smaller race,\r\nBos brachyceros, and was accompanied there for a short time by a third\r\nbovine variety, called Bos trochoceros, an Italian race, supposed\r\nto have been imported from the southern side of the Alps. (Caesar\r\n\"Commentaries\" lib 5 chapter 12.) This last-mentioned race, however,\r\nseems only to have lasted for a short time in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe wild bull (Bos primigenius) is supposed to have flourished for a\r\nwhile in a wild and tame state, just as now in Europe the domestic\r\npig co-exists with the wild boar; and Rutimeyer agrees with Cuvier and\r\nBell,* in considering our larger domestic cattle of northern Europe as\r\nthe descendants of this wild bull, an opinion which Owen disputes.**\r\n\r\n     (* \"British Quadrupeds\" page 415.)\r\n\r\n     (** \"British Fossil Mammal.\" page 500.)\r\n\r\nIn the later division of the stone period, there were two tame races of\r\nthe pig, according to Rutimeyer; one large, and derived from the\r\nwild boar, the other smaller, called the \"marsh-hog,\" or Sus scrofa\r\npalustris. It may be asked how the osteologist can distinguish the tame\r\nfrom the wild races of the same species by their skeletons alone.\r\nAmong other characters, the diminished thickness of the bones and the\r\ncomparative smallness of the ridges, which afford attachment to the\r\nmuscles, are relied on; also the smaller dimensions of the tusks in\r\nthe boar, and of the whole jaw and skull; and, in like manner, the\r\ndiminished size of the horns of the bull and other modifications, which\r\nare the effects of a regular supply of food, and the absence of all\r\nnecessity of exerting their activity and strength to obtain subsistence\r\nand defend themselves against their enemies.\r\n\r\nA middle-sized race of dogs continued unaltered throughout the whole of\r\nthe stone period; but the people of the bronze age possessed a larger\r\nhunting-dog, and with it a small horse, of which genus very few traces\r\nhave been detected in the earlier settlements--a single tooth, for\r\nexample, at Wangen, and only one or two bones at two or three other\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nIn passing from the oldest to the most modern sites, the extirpation of\r\nthe elk and beaver, and the gradual reduction in numbers of the bear,\r\nstag, roe, and freshwater tortoise are distinctly perceptible. The\r\naurochs, or Lithuanian bison, appears to have died out in Switzerland\r\nabout the time when weapons of bronze came into use. It is only in a few\r\nof the most modern lake-dwellings, such as Noville and Chavannes in the\r\nCanton de Vaud (which the antiquaries refer to the sixth century), that\r\nsome traces are observable of the domestic cat, as well as of a sheep\r\nwith crooked horns and with them bones of the domestic fowl.\r\n\r\nAfter the sixth century, no extinction of any wild quadruped nor\r\nintroduction of any tame one appears to have taken place, but the fauna\r\nwas still modified by the wild species continuing to diminish in number\r\nand the tame ones to become more diversified by breeding and crossing,\r\nespecially in the case of the dog, horse, and sheep. On the whole,\r\nhowever, the divergence of the domestic races from their aboriginal wild\r\ntypes, as exemplified at Wangen and Moosseedorf, is confined, according\r\nto Professor Rutimeyer, within narrow limits. As to the goat, it has\r\nremained nearly constant and true to its pristine form, and the small\r\nrace of goat-horned sheep still lingers in some alpine valleys in the\r\nUpper Rhine; and in the same region a race of pigs, corresponding to the\r\ndomesticated variety of Sus scrofa palustris, may still be seen.\r\n\r\nAmidst all this profusion of animal remains extremely few bones of Man\r\nhave been discovered; and only one skull, dredged up from Meilen, on\r\nthe Lake of Zurich, of the early stone period, seems as yet to have been\r\ncarefully examined. Respecting this specimen, Professor His observes\r\nthat it exhibits, instead of the small and rounded form proper to\r\nthe Danish peat-mosses, a type much more like that now prevailing\r\nin Switzerland, which is intermediate between the long-headed and\r\nshort-headed form. (Rutimeyer \"Die Fauna der Pfahlbauten in der Schweiz\"\r\npage 181.)\r\n\r\nSo far, therefore, as we can draw safe conclusions from a single\r\nspecimen, there has been no marked change of race in the human\r\npopulation of Switzerland during the periods above considered.\r\n\r\nIt is still a question whether any of these subaqueous repositories\r\nof ancient relics in Switzerland go back so far in time as the\r\nkitchen-middens of Denmark, for in these last there are no domesticated\r\nanimals except the dog, and no signs of the cultivation of wheat or\r\nbarley; whereas we have seen that, in one of the oldest of the\r\nSwiss settlements, at Wangen, no less than three cereals make their\r\nappearance, with four kinds of domestic animals. Yet there is no small\r\nrisk of error in speculating on the relative claims to antiquity of such\r\nancient tribes, for some of them may have remained isolated for ages and\r\nstationary in their habits, while others advanced and improved.\r\n\r\nWe know that nations, both before and after the introduction of metals,\r\nmay continue in very different stages of civilisation, even after\r\ncommercial intercourse has been established between them, and where they\r\nare separated by a less distance than that which divides the Alps from\r\nthe Baltic.\r\n\r\nThe attempts of the Swiss geologists and archaeologists to estimate\r\ndefinitely in years the antiquity of the bronze and stone periods,\r\nalthough as yet confessedly imperfect, deserve notice, and appear to me\r\nto be full of promise. The most elaborate calculation is that made by M.\r\nMorlot, respecting the delta of the Tiniere, a torrent which flows\r\ninto the Lake of Geneva near Villeneuve. This small delta, to which the\r\nstream is annually making additions, is composed of gravel and sand.\r\nIts shape is that of a flattened cone, and its internal structure has of\r\nlate been laid open to view in a railway cutting 1000 feet long and 32\r\nfeet deep. The regularity of its structure throughout implies that it\r\nhas been formed very gradually, and by the uniform action of the same\r\ncauses. Three layers of vegetable soil, each of which must at one time\r\nhave formed the surface of the cone, have been cut through at different\r\ndepths. The first of these was traced over a surface of 15,000 square\r\nfeet, having an average thickness of 5 inches, and being about 4 feet\r\nbelow the present surface of the cone. This upper layer belonged to the\r\nRoman period, and contained Roman tiles and a coin. The second layer,\r\nfollowed over a surface of 25,000 square feet, was 6 inches thick, and\r\nlay at a depth of 10 feet. In it were found fragments of unvarnished\r\npottery and a pair of tweezers in bronze, indicating the bronze epoch.\r\nThe third layer, followed for 35,000 square feet, was 6 or 7 inches\r\nthick and 19 feet deep. In it were fragments of rude pottery, pieces of\r\ncharcoal, broken bones, and a human skeleton having a small, round and\r\nvery thick skull. M. Morlot, assuming the Roman period to represent an\r\nantiquity of from sixteen to eighteen centuries, assigns to the bronze\r\nage a date of between 3000 and 4000 years, and to the oldest layer, that\r\nof the stone period, an age of from 5000 to 7000 years.\r\n\r\nAnother calculation has been made by M. Troyon to obtain the approximate\r\ndate of the remains of an ancient settlement built on piles and\r\npreserved in a peat-bog at Chamblon, near Yverdun, on the Lake of\r\nNeufchatel. The site of the ancient Roman town of Eburodunum (Yverdun),\r\nonce on the borders of the lake, and between which and the shore there\r\nnow intervenes a zone of newly-gained dry land, 2500 feet in breadth,\r\nshows the rate at which the bed of the lake has been filled up with\r\nriver sediment in fifteen centuries. Assuming the lake to have retreated\r\nat the same rate before the Roman period, the pile-works of Chamblon,\r\nwhich are of the bronze period, must be at the least 3300 years old.\r\n\r\nFor the third calculation, communicated to me by M. Morlot, we are\r\nindebted to M. Victor Gillieron, of Neuveville, on the Lake of Bienne.\r\nIt relates to the age of a pile-dwelling, the mammalian bones of which\r\nare considered by M. Rutimeyer to indicate the earliest portion of\r\nthe stone period of Switzerland, and to correspond in age with the\r\nsettlement of Moosseedorf.\r\n\r\nThe piles in question occur at the Pont de Thiele, between the lakes of\r\nBienne and Neufchatel. The old convent of St. Jean, founded 750 years\r\nago, and built originally on the margin of the Lake of Bienne, is now\r\nat a considerable distance from the shore, and affords a measure of the\r\nrate of the gain of land in seven centuries and a half. Assuming that\r\na similar rate of the conversion of water into marshy land prevailed\r\nantecedently, we should require an addition of sixty centuries for the\r\ngrowth of the morass intervening between the convent and the aquatic\r\ndwelling of Pont de Thiele, in all 6750 years. M. Morlot, after\r\nexamining the ground, thinks it highly probable that the shape of the\r\nbottom on which the morass rests is uniform; but this important point\r\nhas not yet been tested by boring. The result, if confirmed, would agree\r\nexceedingly well with the chronological computation before mentioned\r\nof the age of the stone period of Tiniere. As I have not myself visited\r\nSwitzerland since these chronological speculations were first hazarded,\r\nI am unable to enter critically into a discussion of the objections\r\nwhich have been raised to the two first of them, or to decide on the\r\nmerits of the explanations offered in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH LAKE-DWELLINGS OR CRANNOGES.\r\n\r\nThe lake-dwellings of the British isles, although not explored as yet\r\nwith scientific zeal, as those of Switzerland have been in the last ten\r\nyears, are yet known to be very numerous, and when carefully examined\r\nwill not fail to throw great light on the history of the bronze and\r\nstone periods.\r\n\r\nIn the lakes of Ireland alone, no less than forty-six examples of\r\nartificial islands, called crannoges, have been discovered. They occur\r\nin Leitrim, Roscommon, Cavan, Down, Monaghan, Limerick, Meath, King's\r\nCounty, and Tyrone.*\r\n\r\n     (* W.M. Wylie \"Archaeologia\" volume 38 1859 page 8.)\r\n\r\nOne class of these \"stockaded islands,\" as they have been sometimes\r\ncalled, was formed, according to Mr. Digby Wyatt, by placing horizontal\r\noak beams at the bottom of the lake, into which oak posts, from 6 to\r\n8 feet high, were mortised, and held together by cross beams, till a\r\ncircular enclosure was obtained.\r\n\r\nA space of 520 feet diameter, thus enclosed at Lagore, was divided into\r\nsundry timbered compartments, which were found filled up with mud or\r\nearth, from which were taken \"vast quantities of the bones of oxen,\r\nswine, deer, goats, sheep, dogs, foxes, horses, and asses.\" All these\r\nwere discovered beneath 16 feet of bog, and were used for manure; but\r\nspecimens of them are said to be preserved in the museum of the Royal\r\nIrish Academy. From the same spot were obtained a great collection of\r\nantiquities, which, according to Lord Talbot de Malahide and Mr. Wylie,\r\nwere referable to the ages of stone, bronze, and iron.*\r\n\r\n     (* W.M. Wylie \"Archaeologia\" volume 38 1859 page 8, who\r\n     cites \"Archaeological Journal\" volume 6 page 101.)\r\n\r\nIn Ardekillin Lake, in Roscommon, an islet of an oval form was observed,\r\nmade of a layer of stones resting on logs of timber. Round this\r\nartificial islet or crannoge thus formed was a stone wall raised on oak\r\npiles. A careful description has been put on record by Captain Mudge,\r\nR.N., of a curious log-cabin discovered by him in 1833 in Drumkellin\r\nbog, in Donegal, at a depth of 14 feet from the surface. It was 12 feet\r\nsquare and 9 feet high, being divided into two stories each 4 feet high.\r\nThe planking was of oak split with wedges of stone, one of which was\r\nfound in the building. The roof was flat. A staked enclosure had been\r\nraised round the cabin, and remains of other similar huts adjoining were\r\nseen but not explored. A stone celt, found in the interior of the hut,\r\nand a piece of leather sandal, also an arrow-head of flint, and in the\r\nbog close at hand a wooden sword, give evidence of the remote antiquity\r\nof this building, which may be taken as a type of the early dwellings on\r\nthe Crannoge islands.\r\n\r\n\"The whole structure,\" says Captain Mudge, \"was wrought with the\r\nrudest kind of implements, and the labour bestowed on it must have been\r\nimmense. The wood of the mortises was more bruised than cut, as if by a\r\nblunt stone chisel.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Mudge \"Archaeologia\" volume 26.)\r\n\r\nSuch a chisel lay on the floor of the hut, and by comparing it with\r\nthe marks of the tool used in forming the mortises, they were found \"to\r\ncorrespond exactly, even to the slight curved exterior of the chisel;\r\nbut the logs had been hewn by a larger instrument, in the shape of an\r\naxe. On the floor of the dwelling lay a slab of freestone, 3 feet\r\nlong and 14 inches thick, in the centre of which was a small pit three\r\nquarters of an inch deep, which had been chiselled out. This is presumed\r\nto have been used for holding nuts to be cracked by means of one of the\r\nround shingle stones, also found there, which had served as a hammer.\r\nSome entire hazel-nuts and a great quantity of broken shells were\r\nstrewed about the floor.\"\r\n\r\nThe foundations of the house were made of fine sand, such as is found\r\nwith shingle on the seashore about 2 miles distant. Below the layer of\r\nsand the bog or peat was ascertained, on probing it with an instrument,\r\nto be at least 15 feet thick. Although the interior of the building when\r\ndiscovered was full of \"bog\" or peaty matter, it seems when inhabited to\r\nhave been surrounded by growing trees, some of the trunks and roots\r\nof which are still preserved in their natural position. The depth of\r\noverlying peat affords no safe criterion for calculating the age of the\r\ncabin or village, for I have shown in the \"Principles of Geology\" that\r\nboth in England and Ireland, within historical times, bogs have burst\r\nand sent forth great volumes of black mud, which has been known to\r\ncreep over the country at a slow pace, flowing somewhat at the rate of\r\nordinary lava-currents, and sometimes overwhelming woods and cottages,\r\nand leaving a deposit upon them of bog-earth 15 feet thick.\r\n\r\nNone of these Irish lake-dwellings were built, like those of Helvetia,\r\non platforms supported by piles deeply driven into the mud. \"The\r\nCrannoge system of Ireland seems,\" says Mr. Wylie, \"well nigh without a\r\nparallel in Swiss waters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. -- FOSSIL HUMAN REMAINS AND WORKS OF ART OF THE RECENT\r\nPERIOD--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n  Delta and Alluvial Plain of the Nile.\r\n  Burnt Bricks in Egypt before the Roman Era.\r\n  Borings in 1851-54.\r\n  Ancient Mounds of the Valley of the Ohio.\r\n  Their Antiquity.\r\n  Sepulchral Mound at Santos in Brazil.\r\n  Delta of the Mississippi.\r\n  Ancient Human Remains in Coral Reefs of Florida.\r\n  Changes in Physical Geography in the Human Period.\r\n  Buried Canoes in Marine Strata near Glasgow.\r\n  Upheaval since the Roman Occupation of the Shores of the Firth of Forth.\r\n  Fossil Whales near Stirling.\r\n  Upraised Marine Strata of Sweden on Shores of the Baltic and the Ocean.\r\n  Attempts to compute their Age.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELTA AND ALLUVIAL PLAIN OF THE NILE.\r\n\r\nSome new facts of high interest illustrating the geology of the alluvial\r\nland of Egypt were brought to light between the years 1851 and 1854,\r\nin consequence of investigations suggested to the Royal Society by Mr.\r\nLeonard Horner, and which were partly carried out at the expense of\r\nthe Society. The practical part of the undertaking was entrusted by Mr.\r\nHorner to an Armenian officer of engineers, Hekekyan Bey, who had for\r\nmany years pursued his scientific studies in England, and was in every\r\nway highly qualified for the task.\r\n\r\nIt was soon found that to obtain the required information respecting\r\nthe nature, depth, and contents of the Nile mud in various parts of\r\nthe valley, a larger outlay was called for than had been originally\r\ncontemplated. This expense the late viceroy, Abbas Pasha, munificently\r\nundertook to defray out of his treasury, and his successor, after his\r\ndeath, continued the operations with the same princely liberality.\r\n\r\nSeveral engineers and a body of sixty workmen were employed under the\r\nsuperintendence of Hekekyan Bey, men inured to the climate and able to\r\ncarry on the sinking of shafts and borings during the hot months, after\r\nthe waters of the Nile had subsided, and in a season which would have\r\nbeen fatal to Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe results of chief importance arising out of this inquiry were\r\nobtained from two sets of shafts and borings sunk at intervals in lines\r\ncrossing the great valley from east to west. One of these consisted of\r\nno fewer than fifty-one pits and artesian borings, made where the\r\nvalley is 16 miles wide from side to side between the Arabian and Libyan\r\ndeserts, in the latitude of Heliopolis, about 8 miles above the apex of\r\nthe delta. The other line of borings and pits, twenty-seven in number,\r\nwas in the parallel of Memphis, where the valley is only five miles\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\nEverywhere in these sections the sediment passed through was similar in\r\ncomposition to the ordinary Nile mud of the present day, except near the\r\nmargin of the valley, where thin layers of quartzose sand, such as is\r\nsometimes blown from the adjacent desert by violent winds, were observed\r\nto alternate with the loam.\r\n\r\nA remarkable absence of lamination and stratification was observed\r\nalmost universally in the sediment brought up from all points except\r\nwhere the sandy layers above alluded to occurred. Mr. Horner attributes\r\nthis want of all indication of successive deposition to the extreme\r\nthinness of the film of matter which is thrown down annually on the\r\ngreat alluvial plain during the season of inundation. The tenuity of\r\nthis layer must indeed be extreme, if the French engineers are tolerably\r\ncorrect in their estimate of the amount of sediment formed in a century,\r\nwhich they suppose not to exceed on the average 5 inches. When the\r\nwaters subside, this thin layer of new soil, exposed to a hot sun, dries\r\nrapidly, and clouds of dust are raised by the winds. The superficial\r\ndeposit, moreover, is disturbed almost everywhere by agricultural\r\nlabours, and even were this not the case, the action of worms, insects,\r\nand the roots of plants would suffice to confound together the deposits\r\nof two successive years.\r\n\r\nAll the remains of organic bodies, such as land-shells, and the bones\r\nof quadrupeds, found during the excavations belonged to living species.\r\nBones of the ox, hog, dog, dromedary and ass were not uncommon, but no\r\nvestiges of extinct mammalia. No marine shells were anywhere detected;\r\nbut this was to be expected, as the borings, though they sometimes\r\nreached as low as the level of the Mediterranean, were never carried\r\ndown below it--a circumstance much to be regretted, since where artesian\r\nborings have been made in deltas, as in those of the Po and Ganges, to\r\nthe depth of several hundred feet below the sea level it has been\r\nfound, contrary to expectation, that the deposits passed through were\r\nfluviatile throughout, implying, probably, that a general subsidence of\r\nthose deltas and alluvial formations has taken place. Whether there has\r\nbeen in like manner a sinking of the land in Egypt, we have as yet no\r\nmeans of proving; but Sir Gardner Wilkinson infers it from the position\r\nin the delta on the shore near Alexandria of the tombs commonly called\r\nCleopatra's Baths, which cannot, he says, have been originally built so\r\nas to be exposed to the sea which now fills them, but must have stood on\r\nland above the level of the Mediterranean. The same author adduces, as\r\nadditional signs of subsidence, some ruined towns, now half under water,\r\nin the Lake Menzaleh, and channels of ancient arms of the Nile submerged\r\nwith their banks beneath the waters of that same lagoon.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, the excavations made under the superintendence of\r\nHekekyan Bey were on a large scale for the first 16 or 24 feet, in which\r\ncases jars, vases, pots and a small human figure in burnt clay, a copper\r\nknife, and other entire articles were dug up; but when water soaking\r\nthrough from the Nile was reached the boring instrument used was too\r\nsmall to allow of more than fragments of works of art being brought up.\r\nPieces of burnt brick and pottery were extracted almost everywhere, and\r\nfrom all depths, even where they sank 60 feet below the surface towards\r\nthe central parts of the valley. In none of these cases did they get\r\nto the bottom of the alluvial soil. It has been objected, among other\r\ncriticisms, that the Arabs can always find whatever their employers\r\ndesire to obtain. Even those who are too well acquainted with the\r\nsagacity and energy of Hekekyan Bey to suspect him of having been\r\ndeceived, have suggested that the artificial objects might have fallen\r\ninto old wells which had been filled up. This notion is inadmissible\r\nfor many reasons. Of the ninety-five shafts and borings, seventy or more\r\nwere made far from the sites of towns or villages; and allowing that\r\nevery field may once have had its well, there would be but small chance\r\nof the borings striking upon the site even of a small number of them in\r\nseventy experiments.\r\n\r\nOthers have suggested that the Nile may have wandered over the whole\r\nvalley, undermining its banks on one side and filling up old channels\r\non the other. It has also been asked whether the delta with the numerous\r\nshifting arms of the river may not once have been at every point where\r\nthe auger pierced.*\r\n\r\n     (* For a detailed account of these sections, see Mr.\r\n     Horner's paper in the \"Philosophical Transactions\" for 1855\r\n     to 1858.)\r\n\r\nTo all these objections there are two obvious answers:--First, in\r\nhistorical times the Nile has on the whole been very stationary, and\r\nhas not shifted its position in the valley; secondly, if the mud pierced\r\nthrough had been thrown down by the river in ancient channels, it would\r\nhave been stratified, and would not have corresponded so closely with\r\ninundation mud, we learn from Captain Newbold that he observed in some\r\nexcavations in the great plain alternations of sand and clay, such as\r\nare seen in the modern banks of the Nile; but in the borings made by\r\nHekekyan Bey, such stratification seems scarcely in any case to have\r\nbeen detected.\r\n\r\nThe great aim of the criticisms above enumerated has been to get rid of\r\nthe supposed anomaly of finding burnt brick and pottery at depths and\r\nplaces which would give them claim to an antiquity far exceeding that of\r\nthe Roman domination in Egypt. For until the time of the Romans, it is\r\nsaid, no clay was burnt into bricks in the valley of the Nile. But a\r\ndistinguished antiquary, Mr. S. Birch, assures me that this notion is\r\naltogether erroneous, and that he has under his charge in the British\r\nMuseum, first, a small rectangular baked brick, which came from a Theban\r\ntomb which bears the name of Thothmes, a superintendent of the granaries\r\nof the god Amen Ra, the style of art, inscription, and name, showing\r\nthat it is as old as the 18th dynasty (about 1450 B.C.); secondly, a\r\nbrick bearing an inscription, partly obliterated, but ending with the\r\nwords \"of the temple of Amen Ra.\" This brick, decidedly long anterior to\r\nthe Roman dominion, is referred conjecturally, by Mr. Birch, to the 19th\r\ndynasty, or 1300 B.C. Sir Gardner Wilkinson has also in his possession\r\npieces of mortar, which he took from each of the three great pyramids,\r\nin which bits of broken pottery and of burnt clay or brick are embedded.\r\n\r\nM. Girard, of the French expedition to Egypt, supposed the average rate\r\nof the increase of Nile mud on the plain between Assouan and Cairo to\r\nbe five English inches in a century. This conclusion, according to Mr.\r\nHorner, is very vague, and founded on insufficient data; the amount of\r\nmatter thrown down by the waters in different parts of the plain varying\r\nso much that to strike an average with any approach to accuracy must\r\nbe most difficult. Were we to assume six inches in a century, the burnt\r\nbrick met with at a depth of 60 feet would be 12,000 years old.\r\n\r\nAnother fragment of red brick was found by Linant Bey, in a boring 72\r\nfeet deep, being 2 or 3 feet below the level of the Mediterranean,\r\nin the parallel of the apex of the delta, 200 metres distant from the\r\nriver, on the Libyan side of the Rosetta branch.*\r\n\r\n     (* Horner \"Philosophical Transactions\" 1858.)\r\n\r\nM. Rosiere, in the great French work on Egypt, has estimated the mean\r\nrate of deposit of sediment in the delta at 2 1/4 inches in a century;*\r\nwere we to take 2 1/2 inches, a work of art 72 feet deep must have been\r\nburied more than 30,000 years ago.\r\n\r\n     (* Description de l'Egypte \"Histoire Naturelle\" tome 2 page\r\n     494.)\r\n\r\nBut if the boring of Linant Bey was made where an arm of the river had\r\nbeen silted up at a time when the apex of the delta was somewhat farther\r\nsouth, or more distant from the sea than now, the brick in question\r\nmight be comparatively very modern.\r\n\r\nThe experiments instituted by Mr. Horner at the pedestal of the fallen\r\nstatue of King Rameses at Memphis, in the hope of obtaining an accurate\r\nchronometric scale for testing the age of a given thickness of\r\nNile sediment, are held by some experienced Egyptologists not to be\r\nsatisfactory, on the ground of the uncertainty of the rate of deposit\r\naccumulated at that locality. The point sought to be determined was the\r\nexact amount of Nile mud which had accumulated there since the time when\r\nthat statue is supposed by some antiquaries to have been erected. Could\r\nwe have obtained possession of such a measure, the rate of deposition\r\nmight be judged of, approximately at least, whenever similar mud\r\nwas observed in other places, or below the foundations of those same\r\nmonuments. But the ancient Egyptians are known to have been in the habit\r\nof enclosing with embankments the areas on which they erected temples,\r\nstatues, and obelisks, so as to exclude the waters of the Nile; and the\r\npoint of time to be ascertained, in every case where we find a monument\r\nburied to a certain depth in mud, as at Memphis and Heliopolis, is the\r\nera when the city fell into such decay that the ancient embankments were\r\nneglected, and the river allowed to inundate the site of the temple,\r\nobelisk, or statue.\r\n\r\nEven if we knew the date of the abandonment of such embankments,\r\nthe enclosed areas would not afford a favourable opportunity for\r\nascertaining the average rate of deposit in the alluvial plain; for\r\nHerodotus tells us that in his time those spots from which the Nile\r\nwaters had been shut out for centuries appeared sunk, and could be\r\nlooked down into from the surrounding grounds, which had been raised by\r\nthe gradual accumulation over them of sediment annually thrown down. If\r\nthe waters at length should break into such depressions, they must at\r\nfirst carry with them into the enclosure much mud washed from the steep\r\nsurrounding banks, so that a greater quantity would be deposited in a\r\nfew years than perhaps in as many centuries on the great plain outside\r\nthe depressed area, where no such disturbing causes intervened.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT MOUNDS OF THE VALLEY OF THE OHIO.\r\n\r\nAs I have already given several European examples of monuments of\r\nprehistoric date belonging to the Recent period, I will now turn to\r\nthe American continent. Before the scientific investigation by Messrs.\r\nSquier and Davis of the \"Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley\",*\r\nno one suspected that the plains of that river had been occupied, for\r\nages before the French and British colonists settled there, by a nation\r\nof older date and more advanced in the arts than the Red Indians whom\r\nthe Europeans found there.\r\n\r\n    (* \"Smithsonian Contributions\" volume 1 1847.)\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of large mounds in the basin of the Mississippi, and\r\nespecially in the valleys of the Ohio and its tributaries, which have\r\nserved, some of them for temples, others for outlook or defence, and\r\nothers for sepulture. The unknown people by whom they were constructed,\r\njudging by the form of several skulls dug out of the burial-places, were\r\nof the Mexican or Toltec race. Some of the earthworks are on so grand a\r\nscale as to embrace areas of 50 or 100 acres within a simple enclosure,\r\nand the solid contents of one mould are estimated at 20 million of cubic\r\nfeet, so that four of them would be more than equal in bulk to the Great\r\nPyramid of Egypt, which comprises 75 million. From several of these\r\nrepositories pottery and ornamental sculpture have been taken, and\r\nvarious articles in silver and copper, also stone weapons, some composed\r\nof hornstone unpolished, and much resembling in shape some ancient flint\r\nimplements found near Amiens and other places in Europe, to be alluded\r\nto in the sequel.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the Ohio mound-builders had commercial intercourse with\r\nthe natives of distant regions, for among the buried articles some are\r\nmade of native copper from Lake Superior, and there are also found mica\r\nfrom the Alleghenies, sea-shells from the Gulf of Mexico, and obsidian\r\nfrom the Mexican mountains.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary number of the mounds implies a long period, during\r\nwhich a settled agricultural population had made considerable progress\r\nin civilisation, so as to require large temples for their religious\r\nrites, and extensive fortifications to protect them from their enemies.\r\nThe mounds were almost all confined to fertile valleys or alluvial\r\nplains, and some at least are so ancient that rivers have had time since\r\ntheir construction to encroach on the lower terraces which support them,\r\nand again to recede for the distance of nearly a mile, after having\r\nundermined and destroyed a part of the works. When the first European\r\nsettlers entered the valley of the Ohio, they found the whole region\r\ncovered with an uninterrupted forest, and tenanted by the Red Indian\r\nhunter, who roamed over it without any fixed abode, or any traditionary\r\nconnection with his more civilised predecessors. The only positive data\r\nas yet obtained for calculating the minimum of time which must have\r\nelapsed since the mounds were abandoned, have been derived from the age\r\nand nature of the trees found growing on some of these earthworks. When\r\nI visited Marietta in 1842, Dr. Hildreth took me to one of the mounds,\r\nand showed me where he had seen a tree growing on it, the trunk of which\r\nwhen cut down displayed eight hundred rings of annual growth.*\r\n\r\n     (* Lyell's \"Travels in North America\" volume 2 page 29.)\r\n\r\nBut the late General Harrison, President in 1841 of the United States,\r\nwho was well skilled in woodcraft, has remarked, in a memoir on this\r\nsubject, that several generations of trees must have lived and died\r\nbefore the mounds could have been overspread with that variety of\r\nspecies which they supported when the white man first beheld them, for\r\nthe number and kinds of trees were precisely the same as those which\r\ndistinguished the surrounding forest. \"We may be sure,\" observed\r\nHarrison, \"that no trees were allowed to grow so long as the earthworks\r\nwere in use; and when they were forsaken, the ground, like all newly\r\ncleared land in Ohio, would for a time be monopolised by one or two\r\nspecies of tree, such as the yellow locust and the black or white\r\nwalnut. When the individuals which were the first to get possession of\r\nthe ground had died out one after the other, they would in many cases,\r\ninstead of being replaced by the same species, be succeeded (by virtue\r\nof the law which makes a rotation of crops profitable in agriculture)\r\nby other kinds, till at last, after a great number of centuries\r\n(several thousand years, perhaps), that remarkable diversity of species\r\ncharacteristic of North America, and far exceeding what is seen in\r\nEuropean forests, would be established.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNDS OF SANTOS IN BRAZIL.\r\n\r\nI will next say a few words respecting certain human bones embedded in\r\na solid rock at Santos in Brazil, to which I called attention in my\r\n\"Travels in North America\" in 1842.*\r\n\r\n     (* Volume 1 page 200.)\r\n\r\nI then imagined the deposit containing them to be of submarine\r\norigin--an opinion which I have long ceased to entertain. We learn\r\nfrom a memoir of Dr. Meigs that the River Santos has undermined a large\r\nmound, 14 feet in height, and about 3 acres in area, covered with trees,\r\nnear the town of St. Paul, and has exposed to view many skeletons,\r\nall inclined at angles between 20 and 25 degrees, and all placed in a\r\nsimilar east and west position.*\r\n\r\n     (* Meigs \"Transactions of the American Philosophical\r\n     Society\" 1828 page 285.)\r\n\r\nSeeing, in the Museum of Philadelphia, fragments of the calcareous stone\r\nor tufa from this spot, containing a human skull with teeth, and in the\r\nsame matrix, oysters with serpulae attached, I at first concluded that\r\nthe whole deposit had been formed beneath the waters of the sea, or at\r\nleast, that it had been submerged after its origin, and again upheaved;\r\nalso, that there had been time since its emergence for the growth on it\r\nof a forest of large trees. But after reading again, with more care, the\r\noriginal memoir of Dr. Meigs, I cannot doubt that the shells, like\r\nthose of eatable kinds, so often accumulated in the mounds of the North\r\nAmerican Indians not far from the sea, may have been brought to the\r\nplace and heaped up with other materials at the time when the bodies\r\nwere buried. Subsequently, the whole artificial earthwork, with its\r\nshells and skeletons, may have been bound together into a solid stone by\r\nthe infiltration of carbonate of lime, and the mound may therefore be\r\nof no higher antiquity than some of those above alluded to on the Ohio,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, have in like manner been exposed in the course\r\nof ages to the encroachments and undermining action of rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELTA OF THE MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\nI have shown in my \"Travels in North America\" that the deposits forming\r\nthe delta and alluvial plain of the Mississippi consist of sedimentary\r\nmatter, extending over an area of 30,000 square miles, and known in\r\nsome parts to be several hundred feet deep. Although we cannot estimate\r\ncorrectly how many years it may have required for the river to bring\r\ndown from the upper country so large a quantity of earthy matter--the\r\ndata for such a computation being as yet incomplete--we may still\r\napproximate to a minimum of the time which such an operation must have\r\ntaken, by ascertaining experimentally the annual discharge of water by\r\nthe Mississippi, and the mean annual amount of solid matter contained\r\nin its waters. The lowest estimate of the time required would lead us\r\nto assign a high antiquity, amounting to many tens of thousands of years\r\n(probably more than 100,000) to the existing delta.\r\n\r\nWhether all or how much of this formation may belong to the recent\r\nperiod, as above defined, I cannot pretend to decide, but in one part of\r\nthe modern delta near New Orleans, a large excavation has been made\r\nfor gas-works, where a succession of beds, almost wholly made up of\r\nvegetable matter, has been passed through, such as we now see forming\r\nin the cypress swamps of the neighbourhood, where the deciduous cypress\r\n(Taxodium distichum), with its strong and spreading roots, plays a\r\nconspicuous part. In this excavation, at the depth of sixteen feet\r\nfrom the surface, beneath four buried forests superimposed one upon\r\nthe other, the workmen are stated by Dr. B. Dowler to have found some\r\ncharcoal and a human skeleton, the cranium of which is said to belong to\r\nthe aboriginal type of the Red Indian race. As the discovery in question\r\nhad not been made when I saw the excavation in progress at the gas-works\r\nin 1846, I cannot form an opinion as to the value of the chronological\r\ncalculations which have led Dr. Dowler to ascribe to this skeleton an\r\nantiquity of 50,000 years. In several sections, both natural in the\r\nbanks of the Mississippi and its numerous arms, and where artificial\r\ncanals had been cut, I observed erect stumps of trees, with their roots\r\nattached, buried in strata at different heights, one over the other. I\r\nalso remarked, that many cypresses which had been cut through, exhibited\r\nmany hundreds of rings of annual growth, and it then struck me that\r\nnowhere in the world could the geologist enjoy a more favourable\r\nopportunity for estimating in years the duration of certain portions of\r\nthe Recent epoch.*\r\n\r\n     (* Dowler cited by Dr. W. Usher in Nott and Gliddon's \"Types\r\n     of Mankind\" page 352.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCORAL REEFS OF FLORIDA.\r\n\r\nProfessor Agassiz has described a low portion of the peninsula of\r\nFlorida as consisting of numerous reefs of coral, which have grown in\r\nsuccession so as to give rise to a continual annexation of land, gained\r\ngradually from the sea in a southerly direction. This growth is still\r\nin full activity, and assuming the rate of advance of the land to be one\r\nfoot in a century, the reefs being built up from a depth of 75 feet, and\r\nthat each reef has in its turn added ten miles to the coast, Professor\r\nAgassiz calculates that it has taken 135,000 years to form the southern\r\nhalf of this peninsula. Yet the whole is of Post-Tertiary origin, the\r\nfossil zoophytes and shells being all of the same species as those now\r\ninhabiting the neighbouring sea.*\r\n\r\n    (* Agassiz in Nott and Gliddon ibid. page 352.)\r\n\r\nIn a calcareous conglomerate forming part of the above-mentioned series\r\nof reefs, and supposed by Agassiz, in accordance with his mode of\r\nestimating the rate of growth of those reefs, to be about 10,000 years\r\nold, some fossil human remains were found by Count Pourtales. They\r\nconsisted of jaws and teeth, with some bones of the foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT DEPOSITS OF SEAS AND LAKES.\r\n\r\nI have shown, in the \"Principles of Geology,\" where the recent changes\r\nof the earth illustrative of geology are described at length, that the\r\ndeposits accumulated at the bottom of lakes and seas within the last\r\n4000 or 5000 years can neither be insignificant in volume or extent.\r\nThey lie hidden, for the most part, from our sight; but we have\r\nopportunities of examining them at certain points where newly-gained\r\nland in the deltas of rivers has been cut through during floods, or\r\nwhere coral reefs are growing rapidly, or where the bed of a sea or lake\r\nhas been heaved up by subterranean movements and laid dry.\r\n\r\nAs examples of such changes of level by which marine deposits of the\r\nRecent period have become accessible to human observation, I have\r\nadduced the strata near Naples in which the Temple of Serapis at\r\nPozzuoli was entombed.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles of Geology\" Index \"Serapis.\")\r\n\r\nThese upraised strata, the highest of which are about 25 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, form a terrace skirting the eastern shore of the Bay\r\nof Baiae. They consist partly of clay, partly of volcanic matter, and\r\ncontain fragments of sculpture, pottery, and the remains of buildings,\r\ntogether with great numbers of shells, retaining in part their colour,\r\nand of the same species as those now inhabiting the neighbouring sea.\r\nTheir emergence can be proved to have taken place since the beginning of\r\nthe sixteenth century. [5]\r\n\r\nIn the same work, as an example of a freshwater deposit of the Recent\r\nperiod, I have described certain strata in Cashmere, a country where\r\nviolent earthquakes, attended by alterations in the level of the ground,\r\nare frequent, in which freshwater shells of species now inhabiting the\r\nlakes and rivers of that region are embedded, together with the remains\r\nof pottery, often at the depth of fifty feet, and in which a splendid\r\nHindoo temple has lately been discovered, and laid open to view by the\r\nremoval of the lacustrine silt which had enveloped it for four or five\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nIn the same treatise it is stated that the west coast of South America,\r\nbetween the Andes and the Pacific, is a great theatre of earthquake\r\nmovements, and that permanent upheavals of the land of several feet at\r\na time have been experienced since the discovery of America. In various\r\nparts of the littoral region of Chile and Peru, strata have been\r\nobserved enclosing shells in abundance, all agreeing specifically with\r\nthose now swarming in the Pacific. In one bed of this kind, in the\r\nisland of San Lorenzo, near Lima, Mr. Darwin found, at the altitude of\r\n85 feet above the sea, pieces of cotton-thread, plaited rush, and the\r\nhead of a stalk of Indian corn, the whole of which had evidently been\r\nembedded with the shells. At the same height, on the neighbouring\r\nmainland, he found other signs corroborating the opinion that the\r\nancient bed of the sea had there also been uplifted 85 feet since the\r\nregion was first peopled by the Peruvian race. But similar shelly masses\r\nare also met with at much higher elevations, at innumerable points\r\nbetween the Chilean and Peruvian Andes and the sea-coast, in which\r\nno human remains have as yet been observed. The preservation for an\r\nindefinite period of such perishable substances as thread is explained\r\nby the entire absence of rain in Peru. The same articles, had they been\r\nenclosed in the permeable sands of an European raised beach, or in\r\nany country where rain falls even for a small part of the year, would\r\nprobably have disappeared entirely [6]\r\n\r\nIn the literature of the eighteenth century, we find frequent allusion\r\nto the \"era of existing continents,\" a period supposed to have coincided\r\nin date with the first appearance of Man upon the earth, since which\r\nevent it was imagined that the relative level of the sea and land had\r\nremained stationary, no important geographical changes having occurred,\r\nexcept some slight additions to the deltas of rivers, or the loss of\r\nnarrow strips of land where the sea had encroached upon its shores. But\r\nmodern observations have tended continually to dispel this delusion, and\r\nthe geologist is now convinced that at no given era of the past have the\r\nboundaries of land and sea, or the height of the one and depth of the\r\nother, or the geographical range of the species inhabiting them, whether\r\nof animals or plants, become fixed and unchangeable. Of the extent to\r\nwhich fluctuations have been going on since the globe had already become\r\nthe dwelling-place of Man, some idea may be formed from the examples\r\nwhich I shall give in this and the next nine chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPHEAVAL SINCE THE HUMAN PERIOD OF THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\n[7] It has long been a fact familiar to geologists, that, both\r\non the east and west coasts of the central part of Scotland, there are\r\nlines of raised beaches, containing marine shells of the same species as\r\nthose now inhabiting the neighbouring sea.*\r\n\r\n     (* R. Chambers \"Sea Margins\" 1848 and papers by Mr. Smith of\r\n     Jordan Hill \"Memoirs of the Wernerian Society\" volume 8 and\r\n     by Mr. C. Maclaren. )\r\n\r\nThe two most marked of these littoral deposits occur at heights of about\r\n50 and 25 feet above high-water mark, that of 50 feet being considered\r\nas the more ancient, and owing its superior elevation to a continuance\r\nof the upheaving movement. They are seen in some places to rest on the\r\nboulder clay of the glacial period, which will be described in future\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nIn those districts where large rivers, such as the Clyde, Forth, and\r\nTay, enter the sea, the lower of the two deposits, or that of 25 feet,\r\nexpands into a terrace fringing the estuaries, and varying in breadth\r\nfrom a few yards to several miles. Of this nature are the flat lands\r\nwhich occur along the margin of the Clyde at Glasgow, which consist\r\nof finely laminated sand, silt, and clay. Mr. John Buchanan, a zealous\r\nantiquary, writing in 1855, informs us that in the course of the eighty\r\nyears preceding that date, no less than seventeen canoes had been dug\r\nout of this estuarine silt, and that he had personally inspected a large\r\nnumber of them before they were exhumed. Five of them lay buried in silt\r\nunder the streets of Glasgow, one in a vertical position with the prow\r\nuppermost as if it had sunk in a storm. In the inside of it were a\r\nnumber of marine shells. Twelve other canoes were found about 100 yards\r\nback from the river, at the average depth of about 19 feet from the\r\nsurface of the soil, or 7 feet above high-water mark; but a few of them\r\nwere only 4 or 5 feet deep, and consequently more than 20 feet above\r\nthe sea-level. One was sticking in the sand at an angle of 45 degrees,\r\nanother had been capsized and lay bottom uppermost; all the rest were in\r\na horizontal position, as if they had sunk in smooth water.*\r\n\r\n     (* J. Buchanan \"Report of the British Association\" 1855 page\r\n     80; also \"Glasgow, Past and Present\" 1856.)\r\n\r\nAlmost every one of these ancient boats was formed out of a single\r\noak-stem, hollowed out by blunt tools, probably stone axes, aided by\r\nthe action of fire; a few were cut beautifully smooth, evidently with\r\nmetallic tools. Hence a gradation could be traced from a pattern of\r\nextreme rudeness to one showing great mechanical ingenuity. Two of them\r\nwere built of planks, one of the two, dug up on the property of Bankton\r\nin 1853, being 18 feet in length, and very elaborately constructed. Its\r\nprow was not unlike the beak of an antique galley; its stern, formed of\r\na triangular-shaped piece of oak, fitted in exactly like those of our\r\nday. The planks were fastened to the ribs, partly by singularly shaped\r\noaken pins, and partly by what must have been square nails of some kind\r\nof metal; these had entirely disappeared, but some of the oaken pins\r\nremained. This boat had been upset, and was lying keel uppermost,\r\nwith the prow pointing straight up the river. In one of the canoes, a\r\nbeautifully polished celt or axe of greenstone was found, in the bottom\r\nof another a plug of cork, which, as Mr. Geikie remarks, \"could only\r\nhave come from the latitudes of Spain, Southern France, or Italy.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Geikie, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\"\r\n     volume 18 1862 page 224.)\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that some of these buried vessels are of far more\r\nancient date than others. Those most roughly hewn, may be relics of\r\nthe stone period; those more smoothly cut, of the bronze age; and the\r\nregularly built boat of Bankton may perhaps come within the age of\r\niron. The occurrence of all of them in one and the same upraised marine\r\nformation by no means implies that they belong to the same era, for\r\nin the beds of all great rivers and estuaries, there are changes\r\ncontinually in progress brought about by the deposition, removal, and\r\nredeposition of gravel, sand, and fine sediment, and by the shifting of\r\nthe channel of the main currents from year to year, and from century\r\nto century. All these it behoves the geologist and antiquary to bear in\r\nmind, so as to be always on their guard, when they are endeavouring\r\nto settle the relative date, whether of objects of art or of organic\r\nremains embedded in any set of alluvial strata. Some judicious\r\nobservations on this head occur in Mr. Geikie's memoir above cited,\r\nwhich are so much in point that I shall give them in full, and in his\r\nown words.\r\n\r\n\"The relative position in the silt, from which the canoes were exhumed,\r\ncould help us little in any attempt to ascertain their relative ages,\r\nunless they had been found vertically above each other. The varying\r\ndepths of an estuary, its banks of silt and sand, the set of its\r\ncurrents, and the influence of its tides in scouring out alluvium\r\nfrom some parts of its bottom and redepositing it in others, are\r\ncircumstances which require to be taken into account in all such\r\ncalculations. Mere coincidence of depth from the present surface of the\r\nground, which is tolerably uniform in level, by no means necessarily\r\nproves contemporaneous deposition. Nor would such an inference follow\r\neven from the occurrence of the remains in distant parts of the very\r\nsame stratum. A canoe might be capsized and sent to the bottom just\r\nbeneath low-water mark; another might experience a similar fate on\r\nthe following day, but in the middle of the channel. Both would become\r\nsilted up on the floor of the estuary; but as that floor would be\r\nperhaps 20 feet deeper in the centre than towards the margin of the\r\nriver, the one canoe might actually be twenty feet deeper in the\r\nalluvium than the other; and on the upheaval of the alluvial deposits,\r\nif we were to argue merely from the depth at which the remains were\r\nembedded, we should pronounce the canoe found at the one locality to be\r\nimmensely older than the other, seeing that the fine mud of the estuary\r\nis deposited very slowly and that it must therefore have taken a long\r\nperiod to form so great a thickness as 20 feet. Again, the tides and\r\ncurrents of the estuary, by changing their direction, might sweep away a\r\nconsiderable mass of alluvium from the bottom, laying bare a canoe that\r\nmay have foundered many centuries before. After the lapse of so long an\r\ninterval, another vessel might go to the bottom in the same locality and\r\nbe there covered up with the older one on the same general plane.\r\nThese two vessels, found in such a position, would naturally be classed\r\ntogether as of the same age, and yet it is demonstrable that a very\r\nlong period may have elapsed between the date of the one and that of\r\nthe other. Such an association of these canoes, therefore, cannot be\r\nregarded as proving synchronous deposition; nor, on the other hand, can\r\nwe affirm any difference of age from mere relative position, unless we\r\nsee one canoe actually buried beneath another.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Geikie, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\"\r\n     volume 18 1862, page 222.)\r\n\r\nAt the time when the ancient vessels, above described, were navigating\r\nthe waters where the city of Glasgow now stands, the whole of the low\r\nlands which bordered the present estuary of the Clyde formed the bed of\r\na shallow sea. The emergence appears to have taken place gradually and\r\nby intermittent movements, for Mr. Buchanan describes several narrow\r\nterraces one above the other on the site of the city itself, with steep\r\nintervening slopes composed of the laminated estuary formation. Each\r\nterrace and steep slope probably mark pauses in the process of upheaval,\r\nduring which low cliffs were formed, with beaches at their base. Five\r\nof the canoes were found within the precincts of the city at different\r\nheights on or near such terraces.\r\n\r\nAs to the date of the upheaval, the greater part of it cannot be\r\nassigned to the stone period, but must have taken place after tools of\r\nmetal had come into use.\r\n\r\nUntil lately, when attempts were made to estimate the probable antiquity\r\nof such changes of level, it was confidently assumed, as a safe\r\nstarting-point, that no alteration had occurred in the relative level\r\nof land and sea, in the central district of Scotland, since the\r\nconstruction of the Roman or Pictish wall (the \"Wall of Antonine\"),\r\nwhich reached from the Firth of Forth to that of the Clyde. The two\r\nextremities, it was said, of this ancient structure, bear such a\r\nrelation to the present level of the two estuaries, that neither\r\nsubsidence nor elevation of the land could have occurred for seventeen\r\ncenturies at least.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Geikie has lately shown that a depression of 25 feet on the\r\nForth would not lay the eastern extremity of the Roman wall at Carriden\r\nunder water, and he was therefore desirous of knowing whether the\r\nwestern end of the same would be submerged by a similar amount of\r\nsubsidence. It has always been acknowledged that the wall terminated\r\nupon an eminence called the Chapel Hill, near the village of West\r\nKilpatrick, on the Clyde. The foot of this hill, Mr. Geikie estimates to\r\nbe about 25 or 27 feet above high-water mark, so that a subsidence of 25\r\nfeet could not lay it under water. Antiquaries have sometimes wondered\r\nthat the Romans did not carry the wall farther west than this Chapel\r\nHill; but Mr. Geikie now suggests, in explanation, that all the low land\r\nat present intervening between that point and the mouth of the Clyde,\r\nwas sixteen or seventeen centuries ago, washed by the tides at high\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe wall of Antonine, therefore, yields no evidence in favour of the\r\nland having remained stationary since the time of the Romans, but on\r\nthe contrary, appears to indicate that since its erection the land has\r\nactually risen. Recent explorations by Mr. Geikie and Dr. Young, of the\r\nsites of the old Roman harbours along the southern margin of the Firth\r\nof Forth, lead to similar inferences. In the first place, it has long\r\nbeen known that there is a raised beach containing marine shells of\r\nliving littoral species, at a height of about 25 feet, at Leith, as well\r\nas at other places along the coast above and below Edinburgh. Inveresk,\r\na few miles below that city, is the site of an ancient Roman port,\r\nand if we suppose the sea at high water to have washed the foot of the\r\nheights on which the town stood, the tide would have ascended far up the\r\nvalley of the Esk, and would have made the mouth of that river a safe\r\nand commodious harbour; whereas, had it been a shoaling estuary, as at\r\npresent, it is difficult to see how the Romans should have made choice\r\nof it as a port.\r\n\r\nAt Cramond, at the mouth of the river Almond, above Edinburgh, was\r\nAlaterva, the chief Roman harbour on the southern coast of the Forth,\r\nwhere numerous coins, urns, sculptured stones and the remnant of a\r\nharbour have been detected. The old Roman quays built along what must\r\nthen have been the sea margin, have been found on what is now dry land,\r\nand although some silt carried down in suspension by the waters of the\r\nForth may account for a part of the gain of low land, we yet require\r\nan upward movement of about 20 feet to explain the growth of the dreary\r\nexpanse of mud now stretching along the shore and extending outwards,\r\nwhere it attains its greatest breadth, well-nigh two miles, across which\r\nvessels, even of light burden, can now only venture at full tide. Had\r\nthese shoals existed eighteen centuries ago, they would have prevented\r\nthe Romans from selecting this as their chief port; whereas, if the\r\nland were now to sink 20 feet, Cramond would unquestionably be the best\r\nnatural harbour along the whole of the south side of the Forth.*\r\n\r\n     (* Geikie, \"Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal\" for July\r\n     1861.)\r\n\r\nCorresponding in level with the raised beach at Leith, above mentioned\r\n(or about 25 feet above high-water mark), is the Carse of Stirling, a\r\nlow tract of land consisting of loamy and peaty beds, in which several\r\nskeletons of whales of large size have been found. One of these was dug\r\nup at Airthrie,* near Stirling, about a mile from the river, and 7 miles\r\nfrom the sea.\r\n\r\n     (* Bald, \"Edinburgh Philosophical Journal\" 1 page 393 and\r\n     \"Memoirs of the Wernerian Society\" 3 page 327.)\r\n\r\nMr. Bald mentions that near it were found two pieces of stag's horn,\r\nartificially cut, through one of which a hole, about an inch in\r\ndiameter, had been perforated. Another whale, 85 feet long, was found at\r\nDunmore, a few miles below Stirling,* which, like that of Airthrie, lay\r\nabout 20 feet above high-water mark.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Edinburgh Philosophical Journal\" 11 pages 220, 415.)\r\n\r\nThree other skeletons of whales were found at Blair Drummond, between\r\nthe years 1819 and 1824, 7 miles up the estuary above Stirling,* also at\r\nan elevation of between 20 and 30 feet above the sea. Near two of these\r\nwhales, pointed instruments of deer's horn were found, one of which\r\nretained part of a wooden handle, probably preserved by having been\r\nenclosed in peat. This weapon is now in the museum at Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Memoirs of the Wernerian Society\" volume 5 page 440.)\r\n\r\nThe position of these fossil whales and bone implements, and still more\r\nof an iron anchor found in the Carse of Falkirk, below Stirling, shows\r\nthat the upheaval by which the raised beach of Leith was laid dry\r\nextended far westward probably as far as the Clyde, where, as we have\r\nseen, marine strata containing buried canoes rise to a similar height\r\nabove the sea.\r\n\r\nThe same upward movement which reached simultaneously east and west from\r\nsea to sea was also felt as far north as the estuary of the Tay. This\r\nmay be inferred from the Celtic name of Inch being attached to many\r\nhillocks, which rise above the general level of the alluvial plains,\r\nimplying that these eminences were once surrounded by water or marshy\r\nground. At various localities also in the silt of the Carse of Gowrie\r\niron implements have been found.\r\n\r\nThe raised beach, also containing a great number of marine shells of\r\nrecent species, traced up to a height of 14 feet above the sea by Mr.\r\nW.J. Hamilton at Elie, on the southern coast of Fife, is doubtless\r\nanother effect of the same extensive upheaval.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Proceedings of the Geological Society\" volume 2 1833\r\n     page 280.)\r\n\r\nA similar movement would also account for some changes which antiquaries\r\nhave recorded much farther south, on the borders of the Solway Firth;\r\nthough in this case, as in that of the estuary of the Forth, the\r\nconversion of sea into land has always been referred to the silting\r\nup of estuaries, and not to upheaval. Thus Horsley insists on the\r\ndifficulty of explaining the position of certain Roman stations, on the\r\nSolway, the Forth, and the Clyde, without assuming that the sea has been\r\nexcluded from certain areas which it formerly occupied.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Britannia\" page 157 1860.)\r\n\r\nOn a review of the whole evidence, geological and archaeological,\r\nafforded by the Scottish coast-line, we may conclude that the last\r\nupheaval of 25 feet took place not only since the first human population\r\nsettled in the island; but long after metallic implements had come into\r\nuse, and there seems even a strong presumption in favour of the opinion\r\nthat the date of the elevation may have been subsequent to the Roman\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nBut the 25 feet rise is only the last stage of a long antecedent process\r\nof elevation, for examples of Recent marine shells have been observed 40\r\nfeet and upwards above the sea in Ayrshire. At one of these localities,\r\nMr. Smith of Jordanhill informs me that a rude ornament made of cannel\r\ncoal has been found on the coast in the parish of Dundonald, lying 50\r\nfeet above the sea-level, on the surface of the boulder-clay or till,\r\nand covered with gravel containing marine shells. If we suppose the\r\nupward movement to have been uniform in central Scotland before and\r\nafter the Roman era, and assume that as 25 feet indicate seventeen\r\ncenturies, so 50 feet imply a lapse of twice that number, or 3400\r\nyears, we should then carry back the date of the ornament in question\r\nto fifteen centuries before our era, or to the days of Pharaoh, and the\r\nperiod usually assigned to the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. [8]\r\n\r\nBut all such estimates must be considered, in the present state of\r\nscience, as tentative and conjectural, since the rate of movement of the\r\nland may not have been uniform, and its direction not always upwards,\r\nand there may have been long stationary periods, one of which of more\r\nthan usual duration seems indicated by the 50-foot raised beach, which\r\nhas been traced for vast distances along the western coast of Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAST OF CORNWALL.\r\n\r\nSir H. De la Beche has adduced several proofs of changes of level,\r\nin the course of the human period, in his \"Report on the Geology of\r\nCornwall and Devon,\" 1839. He mentions (page 406) that several human\r\nskulls and works of art, buried in an estuary deposit, were found in\r\nmining gravel for tin at Pentuan, near St. Austell, the skulls lying at\r\nthe depth of 40 feet from the surface, and others at Carnon at the depth\r\nof 53 feet. The overlying strata were marine, containing sea-shells\r\nof living species, and bones of whales, besides the remains of several\r\nliving species of mammalia.\r\n\r\nOther examples of works of art, such as stone hatchets, canoes,\r\nand ships, buried in ancient river-beds in England, and in peat and\r\nshell-marl, I have mentioned in my work before cited.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEDEN AND NORWAY.\r\n\r\nIn the same work I have shown that near Stockholm, in Sweden, there\r\noccur, at slight elevations above the sea-level, horizontal beds\r\nof sand, loam, and marl, containing the same peculiar assemblage of\r\ntestacea which now live in the brackish waters of the Baltic. Mingled\r\nwith these, at different depths, have been detected various works of art\r\nimplying a rude state of civilization, and some vessels built before the\r\nintroduction of iron, and even the remains of an ancient hut, the\r\nmarine strata containing it, which had been formed during a previous\r\ndepression, having been upraised, so that the upper beds are now 60 feet\r\nhigher than the surface of the Baltic. In the neighbourhood of these\r\nrecent strata, both to the north-west and south of Stockholm, other\r\ndeposits similar in mineral composition occur, which ascend to greater\r\nheights, in which precisely the same assemblage of fossil shells is met\r\nwith, but without any intermixture, so far as is yet known, of human\r\nbones or fabricated articles.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite or western coast of Sweden, at Uddevalla, Post-Tertiary\r\nstrata, containing recent shells, not of that brackish water character\r\npeculiar to the Baltic, but such as now live in the Northern Ocean,\r\nascend to the height of 200 feet; and beds of clay and sand of the same\r\nage attain elevations of 300 and even 600 feet in Norway, where they\r\nhave been usually described as \"raised beaches.\" They are, however,\r\nthick deposits of submarine origin, spreading far and wide, and filling\r\nvalleys in the granite and gneiss, just as the Tertiary formations, in\r\ndifferent parts of Europe, cover or fill depressions in the older rocks.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fossil fauna characterising these upraised sands and clays\r\nconsists exclusively of existing northern species of testacea, it is\r\nmore than probable that they may not all belong to that division of the\r\nPleistocene strata which we are now considering. If the contemporary\r\nmammalia were known, they would, in all likelihood, be found to be\r\nreferable, at least in part, to extinct species; for, according to Loven\r\n(an able living naturalist of Norway), the species do not constitute\r\nsuch an assemblage as now inhabits corresponding latitudes in the North\r\nSea. On the contrary, they decidedly represent a more arctic fauna. In\r\norder to find the same species flourishing in equal abundance, or\r\nin many cases to find them at all, we must go northwards to higher\r\nlatitudes than Uddevalla in Sweden, or even nearer the pole than Central\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nJudging by the uniformity of climate now prevailing from century to\r\ncentury, and the insensible rate of variation in the geographical\r\ndistribution of organic beings in our own times, we may presume that\r\nan extremely lengthened period was required even for so slight a\r\nmodification in the range of the molluscous fauna, as that of which\r\nthe evidence is here brought to light. There are also other independent\r\nreasons for suspecting that the antiquity of these deposits may be\r\nindefinitely great as compared to the historical period. I allude to\r\ntheir present elevation above the sea, some of them rising, in Norway,\r\nto the height of 600 feet or more. The upward movement now in progress\r\nin parts of Norway and Sweden extends, as I have elsewhere shown,*\r\nthroughout an area about 1000 miles north and south, and for an unknown\r\ndistance east and west, the amount of elevation always increasing as we\r\nproceed towards the North Cape, where it is said to equal 5 feet in a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles\" 9th edition chapter 30.)\r\n\r\nIf we could assume that there had been an average of 2 1/2 feet in each\r\nhundred years for the last fifty centuries, this would give an elevation\r\nof 125 feet in that period. In other words, it would follow that the\r\nshores, and a considerable area of the former bed of the North Sea, had\r\nbeen uplifted vertically to that amount, and converted into land in\r\nthe course of the last 5000 years. A mean rate of continuous vertical\r\nelevation of 2 1/2 feet in a century would, I conceive, be a high\r\naverage; yet, even if this be assumed, it would require 24,000 years for\r\nparts of the sea-coast of Norway, where the Pleistocene marine strata\r\noccur, to attain the height of 600 feet.

TOURNAL AND CHRISTOL IN 1828 IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Principles of Geology,\" when treating of the fossil remains\r\nfound in alluvium and the mud of caverns, I gave an account in 1832\r\nof the investigations made by MM. Tournal and Christol in the South of\r\nFrance.*\r\n\r\n     (* 1st edition volume 2 chapter 14 1832, and 9th edition\r\n     page 738, 1853.)\r\n\r\nM. Tournal stated in his memoir that in the cavern of Bize, in the\r\ndepartment of the Aude, he had found human bones and teeth, together\r\nwith fragments of rude pottery, in the same mud and breccia cemented by\r\nstalagmite in which land-shells of living species were embedded, and the\r\nbones of mammalia, some of extinct, others of recent species. The human\r\nbones were declared by his fellow-labourer, M. Marcel de Serres, to be\r\nin the same chemical condition as those of the accompanying quadrupeds.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Annales des Sciences Naturelles\" tome 15 1828 page 348.)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of these fossils of the Bize cavern five years later, M.\r\nTournal observed that they could not be referred, as some suggested,\r\nto a \"diluvial catastrophe,\" for they evidently had not been washed in\r\nsuddenly by a transient flood, but must have been introduced gradually,\r\ntogether with the enveloping mud and pebbles, at successive periods.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Annales de Chimie et de Physique\" 1833 page 161.)\r\n\r\nM. Christol, who was engaged at the same time in similar researches in\r\nanother part of Languedoc, published an account of them a year later,\r\nin which he described some human bones, as occurring in the cavern of\r\nPondres, near Nimes, in the same mud with the bones of an extinct hyaena\r\nand rhinoceros.*\r\n\r\n     (* Christol, \"Notice sur les Ossements humains des Cavernes\r\n     du Gard\" Montpellier 1829.)\r\n\r\nThe cavern was in this instance filled up to the roof with mud and\r\ngravel, in which fragments of two kinds of pottery were detected, the\r\nlowest and rudest near the bottom of the cave, below the level of the\r\nextinct mammalia.\r\n\r\nIt has never been questioned that the hyaena and rhinoceros found by M.\r\nChristol were of extinct species; but whether the animals enumerated\r\nby M. Tournal might not all of them be referred to quadrupeds which\r\nare known to have been living in Europe in the historical period seems\r\ndoubtful. They were said to consist of a stag, an antelope, and a\r\ngoat, all named by M. Marcel de Serres as new; but the majority of\r\npalaeontologists do not agree with this opinion. Still it is true, as\r\nM. Lartet remarks, that the fauna of the cavern of Bize must be of very\r\nhigh antiquity, as shown by the presence, not only of the Lithuanian\r\naurochs (Bison europaeus), but also of the reindeer, which has not been\r\nan inhabitant of the South of France in historical times, and which,\r\nin that country, is almost everywhere associated, whether in ancient\r\nalluvium or in the mud of caverns, with the mammoth.\r\n\r\nIn my work before cited,* I stated that M. Desnoyers, an observer\r\nequally well versed in geology and archaeology, had disputed the\r\nconclusion arrived at by MM. Tournal and Christol, that the fossil\r\nrhinoceros, hyaena, bear, and other lost species had once been\r\ninhabitants of France contemporaneously with Man.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles\" 9th edition page 739.)\r\n\r\n\"The flint hatchets and arrow-heads,\" he said, \"and the pointed bones\r\nand coarse pottery of many French and English caves, agree precisely in\r\ncharacter with those found in the tumuli, and under the dolmens (rude\r\naltars of unhewn stone) of the primitive inhabitants of Gaul, Britain,\r\nand Germany. The human bones, therefore, in the caves which are\r\nassociated with such fabricated objects, must belong not to antediluvian\r\nperiods, but to a people in the same stage of civilization as those who\r\nconstructed the tumuli and altars.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the Gaulish monuments,\" he added, \"we find, together with the\r\nobjects of industry above mentioned, the bones of wild and domestic\r\nanimals of species now inhabiting Europe, particularly of deer, sheep,\r\nwild boars, dogs, horses, and oxen. This fact has been ascertained in\r\nQuercy and other provinces; and it is supposed by antiquaries that the\r\nanimals in question were placed beneath the Celtic altars in memory of\r\nsacrifices offered to the Gaulish divinity Hesus, and in the tombs to\r\ncommemorate funeral repasts, and also from a superstition prevalent\r\namong savage nations, which induces them to lay up provisions for\r\nthe manes of the dead in a future life. But in none of these ancient\r\nmonuments have any bones been found of the elephant, rhinoceros, hyaena,\r\ntiger, and other quadrupeds, such as are found in caves, which might\r\ncertainly have been expected had these species continued to flourish at\r\nthe time that this part of Gaul was inhabited by Man.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Desnoyers, \"Bulletin de la Societe Geologique de France\"\r\n     tome 2 page 252; and article on Caverns, \"Dictionnaire\r\n     Universelle d'Histoire Naturelle\" Paris 1845.)\r\n\r\nAfter giving no small weight to the arguments of M. Desnoyers, and\r\nthe writings of Dr. Buckland on the same subject, and myself visiting\r\nseveral caves in Germany, I came to the opinion that the human bones\r\nmixed with those of extinct animals, in osseous breccias and cavern\r\nmud, in different parts of Europe, were probably not coeval. The caverns\r\nhaving been at one period the dens of wild beasts, and having served\r\nat other times as places of human habitation, worship, sepulture,\r\nconcealment, or defence, one might easily conceive that the bones of Man\r\nand those of animals, which were strewed over the floors of subterranean\r\ncavities, or which had fallen into tortuous rents connecting them\r\nwith the surface, might, when swept away by floods, be mingled in one\r\npromiscuous heap in the same ossiferous mud or breccia.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles\" 9th edition page 740.)\r\n\r\nThat such intermixtures have really taken place in some caverns, and\r\nthat geologists have occasionally been deceived, and have assigned to\r\none and the same period fossils which had really been introduced at\r\nsuccessive times, will readily be conceded. But of late years we have\r\nobtained convincing proofs, as we shall see in the sequel, that the\r\nmammoth, and many other extinct mammalian species very common in caves,\r\noccur also in undisturbed alluvium, embedded in such a manner with\r\nworks of art, as to leave no room for doubt that Man and the mammoth\r\ncoexisted; Such discoveries have led me, and other geologists, to\r\nreconsider the evidence previously derived from caves brought forward\r\nin proof of the high antiquity of Man. With a view of re-examining this\r\nevidence, I have lately explored several caverns in Belgium and other\r\ncountries, and re-read the principal memoirs and treatises treating of\r\nthe fossil remains preserved in them, the results of which inquiries I\r\nshall now proceed to lay before the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESEARCHES, IN 1833-1834, OF DR. SCHMERLING IN THE CAVERNS NEAR LIEGE.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Schmerling of Liege, a skilful anatomist and\r\npalaeontologist, after devoting several years to the exploring of the\r\nnumerous ossiferous caverns which border the valleys of the Meuse and\r\nits tributaries, published two volumes descriptive of the contents of\r\nmore than forty caverns. One of these volumes consisted of an atlas of\r\nplates, illustrative of the fossil bones.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Recherches sur les Ossements fossiles decouverts dans\r\n     les Cavernes de la Province de Liege\", Liege 1833-1834.)\r\n\r\nMany of the caverns had never before been entered by scientific\r\nobservers, and their floors were encrusted with unbroken stalagmite. At\r\na very early stage of his investigations, Dr. Schmerling found the bones\r\nof Man so rolled and scattered as to preclude all idea of their having\r\nbeen intentionally buried on the spot. He also remarked that they were\r\nof the same colour, and in the same condition as to the amount of animal\r\nmatter contained in them, as those of the accompanying animals, some\r\nof which, like the cave-bear, hyaena, elephant, and rhinoceros, were\r\nextinct; others, like the wild cat, beaver, wild boar, roe-deer, wolf,\r\nand hedgehog, still extant. The fossils were lighter than fresh bones,\r\nexcept such as had their pores filled with carbonate of lime, in which\r\ncase they were often much heavier. The human remains of most frequent\r\noccurrence were teeth detached from the jaw, and the carpal, metacarpal,\r\ntarsal, metatarsal, and phalangeal bones separated from the rest of the\r\nskeleton. The corresponding bones of the cave-bear, the most abundant\r\nof the accompanying mammalia, were also found in the Liege caverns\r\nmore commonly than any others, and in the same scattered condition.\r\nOccasionally, some of the long bones of mammalia were observed to\r\nhave been first broken across, and then reunited or cemented again by\r\nstalagmite, as they lay on the floor of the cave.\r\n\r\nNo gnawed bones nor any coprolites were found by Schmerling. He\r\ntherefore inferred that the caverns of the province of Liege had not\r\nbeen the dens of wild beasts, but that their organic and inorganic\r\ncontents had been swept into them by streams communicating with the\r\nsurface of the country. The bones, he suggested, may often have been\r\nrolled in the beds of such streams before they reached their underground\r\ndestination. To the same agency the introduction of many land-shells\r\ndispersed through the cave-mud was ascribed, such as Helix nemoralis,\r\nH. lapicida, H. pomatia, and others of living species. Mingled with such\r\nshells, in some rare instances, the bones of freshwater fish, and of a\r\nsnake (Coluber), as well as of several birds, were detected.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence here and there of bones in a very perfect state, or of\r\nseveral bones belonging to the same skeleton in natural juxtaposition,\r\nand having all their most delicate apophyses uninjured, while many\r\naccompanying bones in the same breccia were rolled, broken, or decayed,\r\nwas accounted for by supposing that portions of carcasses were sometimes\r\nfloated in during floods while still clothed with their flesh. No\r\nexample was discovered of an entire skeleton, not even of one of the\r\nsmaller mammalia, the bones of which are usually the least injured.\r\n\r\nThe incompleteness of each skeleton was especially ascertained in regard\r\nto the human subjects, Dr. Schmerling being careful, whenever a fragment\r\nof such presented itself, to explore the cavern himself, and see whether\r\nany other bones of the same skeleton could be found. In the Engis\r\ncavern, distant about eight miles to the south-west of Liege, on the\r\nleft bank of the Meuse, the remains of at least three human individuals\r\nwere disinterred. The skull of one of these, that of a young person, was\r\nembedded by the side of a mammoth's tooth. It was entire but so fragile,\r\nthat nearly all of it fell to pieces during its extraction. Another\r\nskull, that of an adult individual, and the only one preserved by Dr.\r\nSchmerling in a sufficient state of integrity to enable the anatomist to\r\nspeculate on the race to which it belonged, was buried 5 feet deep in a\r\nbreccia, in which the tooth of a rhinoceros, several bones of a horse,\r\nand some of the reindeer, together with some ruminants, occurred. This\r\nskull, now in the museum of the University of Liege, is figured in\r\nChapter 5 (Figure 2), where further observations will be offered on\r\nits anatomical character, after a fuller account of the contents of the\r\nLiege caverns has been laid before the reader.\r\n\r\nOn the right bank of the Meuse, on the opposite side of the river to\r\nEngis, is the cavern of Engihoul. Bones of extinct animals mingled with\r\nthose of Man were observed to abound in both caverns; but with this\r\ndifference, that whereas in the Engis cave there were several human\r\ncrania and very few other bones, in Engihoul there occurred numerous\r\nbones of the extremities belonging to at least three human individuals,\r\nand only two small fragments of a cranium. The like capricious\r\ndistribution held good in other caverns, especially with reference to\r\nthe cave-bear, the most frequent of the extinct mammalia. Thus, for\r\nexample in the cave of Chokier, skulls of the bear were few, and other\r\nparts of the skeleton abundant, whereas in several other caverns these\r\nproportions were exactly reversed, while at Goffontaine skulls of\r\nthe bear and other parts of the skeleton were found in their natural\r\nnumerical proportions. Speaking generally, it may be said that human\r\nbones, where any were met with, occurred at all depths in the cave-mud\r\nand gravel, sometimes above and sometimes below those of the bear,\r\nelephant, rhinoceros, hyaena, etc.\r\n\r\nSome rude flint implements of the kind commonly called flint knives or\r\nflakes, of a triangular form in the cross section (as in Figure 14),\r\nwere found by Schmerling dispersed generally through the cave-mud, but\r\nhe was too much engrossed with his osteological inquiries to collect\r\nthem diligently. He preserved some few of them, however, which I have\r\nseen in the museum at Liege. He also discovered in the cave of Chokier,\r\n2 1/2 miles south-west from Liege, a polished and jointed needle-shaped\r\nbone, with a hole pierced obliquely through it at the base; such a\r\ncavity, he observed, as had never given passage to an artery. This\r\ninstrument was embedded in the same matrix with the remains of a\r\nrhinoceros.*\r\n\r\n     (* Schmerling part 2 page 177.)\r\n\r\nAnother cut bone and several artificially-shaped flints were found in\r\nthe Engis cave, near the human skulls before alluded to. Schmerling\r\nobserved, and we shall have to refer to the fact in the sequel (Chapter\r\n8), that although in some forty fossiliferous caves explored by\r\nhim human bones were the exception, yet these flint implements were\r\nuniversal, and he added that \"none of them could have been subsequently\r\nintroduced, being precisely in the same position as the remains of\r\nthe accompanying animals.\" \"I therefore,\" he continues, \"attach great\r\nimportance to their presence; for even if I had not found the human\r\nbones under conditions entirely favourable to their being considered\r\nas belonging to the antediluvian epoch, proofs of Man's existence would\r\nstill have been supplied by the cut bones and worked flints.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Schmerling, part 2 page 179.)\r\n\r\nDr. Schmerling, therefore, had no hesitation in concluding from the\r\nvarious facts ascertained by him, that Man once lived in the Liege\r\ndistrict contemporaneously with the cave-bear and several other extinct\r\nspecies of quadrupeds. But he was much at a loss when he attempted to\r\ninvent a theory to explain the former state of the fauna of the region\r\nnow drained by the Meuse; for he shared the notion, then very prevalent\r\namong naturalists, that the mammoth and the hyaena* were beasts of a\r\nwarmer climate than that now proper to Western Europe.\r\n\r\n     (* Ibid. part 2 pages 70 and 96.)\r\n\r\nIn order to account for the presence of such \"tropical species,\" he was\r\nhalf-inclined to imagine that they had been transported by a flood from\r\nsome distant region; then again he raised the question whether they\r\nmight not have been washed out of an older alluvium, which may have\r\npre-existed in the neighbourhood. This last hypothesis was directly at\r\nvariance with his own statements, that the remains of the mammoth and\r\nhyaena were identical in appearance, colour, and chemical condition with\r\nthose of the bear and other associated fossil animals, none of which\r\nexhibited signs of having been previously enveloped in any dissimilar\r\nmatrix. Another enigma which led Schmerling astray in some of his\r\ngeological speculations was the supposed presence of the agouti, a\r\nSouth American rodent, \"proper to the torrid zone.\" My friend M. Lartet,\r\nguided by Schmerling's figures of the teeth of this species, suggests,\r\nand I have little doubt with good reason, that they appertain to the\r\nporcupine, a genus found fossil in Pleistocene deposits of certain\r\ncaverns in the south of France.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1833, I passed through Liege, on my way to the Rhine, and\r\nconversed with Dr. Schmerling, who showed me his splendid collection,\r\nand when I expressed some incredulity respecting the alleged antiquity\r\nof the fossil human bones, he pointedly remarked that if I doubted their\r\nhaving been contemporaneous with the bear or rhinoceros, on the ground\r\nof Man being a species of more modern date, I ought equally to doubt the\r\nco-existence of all the other living species, such as the red deer, roe,\r\nwild cat, wild boar, wolf, fox, weasel, beaver, hare, rabbit, hedgehog,\r\nmole, dormouse, field-mouse, water-rat, shrew, and others, the bones\r\nof which he had found scattered everywhere indiscriminately through the\r\nsame mud with the extinct quadrupeds. The year after this conversation\r\nI cited Schmerling's opinions, and the facts bearing on the antiquity of\r\nMan, in the 3rd edition of my \"Principles of Geology\" (page 161, 1834),\r\nand in succeeding editions, without pretending to call in question their\r\ntrustworthiness, but at the same time without giving them the weight\r\nwhich I now consider they were entitled to. He had accumulated ample\r\nevidence to prove that Man had been introduced into the earth at an\r\nearlier period than geologists were then willing to believe.\r\n\r\nOne positive fact, it will be said, attested by so competent a witness,\r\nought to have outweighed any amount of negative testimony, previously\r\naccumulated, respecting the non-occurrence elsewhere of human remains\r\nin formations of the like antiquity. In reply, I can only plead that\r\na discovery which seems to contradict the general tenor of previous\r\ninvestigations is naturally received with much hesitation. To have\r\nundertaken in 1832, with a view of testing its truth, to follow the\r\nBelgian philosopher through every stage of his observations and proofs,\r\nwould have been no easy task even for one well-skilled in geology and\r\nosteology. To be let down, as Schmerling was, day after day, by a rope\r\ntied to a tree, so as to slide to the foot of the first opening of the\r\nEngis cave,* where the best-preserved human skulls were found; and,\r\nafter thus gaining access to the first subterranean gallery, to creep on\r\nall fours through a contracted passage leading to larger chambers, there\r\nto superintend by torchlight, week after week and year after year,\r\nthe workmen who were breaking through the stalagmitic crust as hard as\r\nmarble, in order to remove piece by piece the underlying bone-breccia\r\nnearly as hard; to stand for hours with one's feet in the mud, and\r\nwith water dripping from the roof on one's head, in order to mark the\r\nposition and guard against the loss of each single bone of a skeleton;\r\nand at length, after finding leisure, strength, and courage for all\r\nthese operations, to look forward, as the fruits of one's labour, to the\r\npublication of unwelcome intelligence, opposed to the prepossessions\r\nof the scientific as well as of the unscientific public--when these\r\ncircumstances are taken into account, we need scarcely wonder, not only\r\nthat a passing traveller failed to stop and scrutinise the evidence,\r\nbut that a quarter of a century should have elapsed before even the\r\nneighbouring professors of the University of Liege came forth to\r\nvindicate the truthfulness of their indefatigable and clear-sighted\r\ncountryman.\r\n\r\n     (* Schmerling part 1 page 30.)\r\n\r\nIn 1860, when I revisited Liege, twenty-six years after my interview\r\nwith Schmerling, I found that several of the caverns described by him\r\nhad in the interval been annihilated. Not a vestige, for example, of the\r\ncaves of Engis, Chokier, and Goffontaine remained. The calcareous stone,\r\nin the heart of which the cavities once existed, had been quarried away,\r\nand removed bodily for building and lime-making. Fortunately, a great\r\npart of the Engihoul cavern, situated on the right bank of the Meuse,\r\nwas still in the same state as when Schmerling delved into it in 1831,\r\nand drew from it the bones of three human skeletons. I determined,\r\ntherefore, to examine it, and was so fortunate as to obtain the\r\nassistance of a zealous naturalist of Liege, Professor Malaise, who\r\naccompanied me to the cavern, where we engaged some workmen to break\r\nthrough the crust of stalagmite, so that we could search for bones in\r\nthe undisturbed earth beneath. Bones and teeth of the cave-bear were\r\nsoon found, and several other extinct quadrupeds which Schmerling has\r\nenumerated. My companion, continuing the work perseveringly for weeks\r\nafter my departure, succeeded at length in extracting from the same\r\ndeposit, at the depth of 2 feet below the crust of stalagmite, three\r\nfragments of a human skull, and two perfect lower jaws with teeth, all\r\nassociated in such a manner with the bones of bears, large pachyderms,\r\nand ruminants, and so precisely resembling these in colour and state of\r\npreservation, as to leave no doubt in his mind that Man was contemporary\r\nwith the extinct animals. Professor Malaise has given figures of the\r\nhuman remains in the \"Bulletin\" of the Royal Academy of Belgium for\r\n1860.*\r\n\r\n     (* Volume 10 page 546.)\r\n\r\nThe rock in which the Liege caverns occur belongs generally to the\r\nCarboniferous or Mountain Limestone, in some few cases only to the older\r\nDevonian formation. Whenever the work of destruction has not gone too\r\nfar, magnificent sections, sometimes 200 and 300 feet in height, are\r\nexposed to view. They confirm Schmerling's doctrine, that most of the\r\nmaterials, organic and inorganic, now filling the caverns, have been\r\nwashed into them through narrow vertical or oblique fissures, the upper\r\nextremities of which are choked up with soil and gravel, and would\r\nscarcely ever be discoverable at the surface, especially in so wooded\r\na country. Among the sections obtained by quarrying, one of the\r\nfinest which I saw was in the beautiful valley of Fond du Foret, above\r\nChaudefontaine, not far from the village of Magnee, where one of the\r\nrents communicating with the surface has been filled up to the brim with\r\nrounded and half-rounded stones, angular pieces of limestone and shale,\r\nbesides sand and mud, together with bones, chiefly of the cave-bear.\r\nConnected with this main duct, which is from 1 to 2 feet in width, are\r\nseveral minor ones, each from 1 to 3 inches wide, also extending to the\r\nupper country or table-land, and choked up with similar materials. They\r\nare inclined at angles of 30 and 40 degrees, their walls being generally\r\ncoated with stalactite, pieces of which have here and there been broken\r\noff and mingled with the contents of the rents, thus helping to explain\r\nwhy we so often meet with detached pieces of that substance in the mud\r\nand breccia of the Belgian caves. It is not easy to conceive that a\r\nsolid horizontal floor of hard stalagmite should, after its formation,\r\nbe broken up by running water; but when the walls of steep and tortuous\r\nrents, serving as feeders to the principal fissures and to inferior\r\nvaults and galleries are encrusted with stalagmite, some of the\r\nincrustation may readily be torn up when heavy fragments of rock are\r\nhurried by a flood through passages inclined at angles of 30 or 40\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nThe decay and decomposition of the fossil bones seem to have been\r\narrested in most of the caves by a constant supply of water charged with\r\ncarbonate of lime, which dripped from the roofs while the caves were\r\nbecoming gradually filled up. By similar agency the mud, sand, and\r\npebbles were usually consolidated.\r\n\r\nThe following explanation of this phenomenon has been suggested by the\r\neminent chemist Liebig. On the surface of Franconia, where the limestone\r\nabounds in caverns, is a fertile soil in which vegetable matter is\r\ncontinually decaying. This mould or humus, being acted on by moisture\r\nand air, evolves carbonic acid, which is dissolved by rain. The rain\r\nwater, thus impregnated, permeates the porous limestone, dissolves\r\na portion of it, and afterwards, when the excess of carbonic acid\r\nevaporates in the caverns, parts with the calcareous matter and forms\r\nstalactite. So long as water flows, even occasionally, through a suite\r\nof caverns, no layer of pure stalagmite can be produced; hence the\r\nformation of such a layer is generally an event posterior in date to the\r\ncessation of the old system of drainage, an event which might be brought\r\nabout by an earthquake causing new fissures, or by the river wearing its\r\nway down to a lower level, and thenceforth running in a new channel.\r\n\r\nIn all the subterranean cavities, more than forty in number, explored\r\nby Schmerling, he only observed one cave, namely that of Chokier, where\r\nthere were two regular layers of stalagmite, divided by fossiliferous\r\ncave-mud. In this instance, we may suppose that the stream, after\r\nflowing for a long period at one level, cut its way down to an inferior\r\nsuite of caverns, and, flowing through them for centuries, choked them\r\nup with debris; after which it rose once more to its original higher\r\nlevel: just as in the Mountain Limestone district of Yorkshire some\r\nrivers, habitually absorbed by a \"swallow hole,\" are occasionally unable\r\nto discharge all their water through it; in which case they rise and\r\nrush through a higher subterranean passage, which was at some former\r\nperiod in the regular line of drainage, as is often attested by the\r\nfluviatile gravel still contained in it.\r\n\r\nThere are now in the basin of the Meuse, not far from Liege, several\r\nexamples of engulfed brooks and rivers: some of them, like that of St.\r\nHadelin, east of Chaudefontaine, which reappears after an underground\r\ncourse of a mile or two; others, like the Vesdre, which is lost near\r\nGoffontaine, and after a time re-emerges; some, again, like the torrent\r\nnear Magnee, which, after entering a cave, never again comes to the day.\r\nIn the season of floods such streams are turbid at their entrance, but\r\nclear as a mountain-spring where they issue again; so that they must\r\nbe slowly filling up cavities in the interior with mud, sand, pebbles,\r\nsnail-shells, and the bones of animals which may be carried away during\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which some of the large thigh and shank bones of the\r\nrhinoceros and other pachyderms are rounded, while some of the smaller\r\nbones of the same creatures, and of the hyaena, bear, and horse, are\r\nreduced to pebbles, shows that they were often transported for some\r\ndistance in the channels of torrents, before they found a resting-place.\r\n\r\nWhen we desire to reason or speculate on the probable antiquity of human\r\nbones found fossil in such situations as the caverns near Liege, there\r\nare two classes of evidence to which we may appeal for our guidance.\r\nFirst, considerations of the time required to allow of many species\r\nof carnivorous and herbivorous animals, which flourished in the cave\r\nperiod, becoming first scarce, and then so entirely extinct as we have\r\nseen that they had become before the era of the Danish peat and Swiss\r\nlake dwellings; secondly, the great number of centuries necessary for\r\nthe conversion of the physical geography of the Liege district from its\r\nancient to its present configuration; so many old underground channels,\r\nthrough which brooks and rivers flowed in the cave period, being now\r\nlaid dry and choked up.\r\n\r\nThe great alterations which have taken place in the shape of the valley\r\nof the Meuse and some of its tributaries are often demonstrated by the\r\nabrupt manner in which the mouths of fossiliferous caverns open in the\r\nface of perpendicular precipices 200 feet or more in height above\r\nthe present streams. There appears also, in many cases, to be such a\r\ncorrespondence in the openings of caverns on opposite sides of some of\r\nthe valleys, both large and small, as to incline one to suspect that\r\nthey originally belonged to a series of tunnels and galleries which\r\nwere continuous before the present system of drainage came into play, or\r\nbefore the existing valleys were scooped out. Other signs of subsequent\r\nfluctuations are afforded by gravel containing elephant's bones at\r\nslight elevations above the Meuse and several of its tributaries. It may\r\nbe objected that, according to the present rate of change, no lapse of\r\nages would suffice to bring about such revolutions in physical geography\r\nas we are here contemplating. This may be true. It is more than probable\r\nthat the rate of change was once far more active than it is now in the\r\nbasin of the Meuse. Some of the nearest volcanoes, namely, those of\r\nthe Lower Eifel about 60 miles to the eastward, seem to have been in\r\neruption in Pleistocene times, and may perhaps have been connected\r\nand coeval with repeated risings or sinkings of the land in the Liege\r\ndistrict. It might be said, with equal truth, that according to the\r\npresent course of events, no series of ages would suffice to reproduce\r\nsuch an assemblage of cones and craters as those of the Eifel (near\r\nAndernach, for example); and yet some of them may be of sufficiently\r\nmodern date to belong to the era when Man was contemporary with the\r\nmammoth and rhinoceros in the basin of the Meuse.\r\n\r\nBut, although we may be unable to estimate the minimum of time required\r\nfor the changes in physical geography above alluded to, we cannot\r\nfail to perceive that the duration of the period must have been very\r\nprotracted, and that other ages of comparative inaction may have\r\nfollowed, separating the Pleistocene from the historical periods, and\r\nconstituting an interval no less indefinite in its duration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. -- PLEISTOCENE PERIOD--FOSSIL HUMAN SKULLS OF THE NEANDERTHAL\r\nAND ENGIS CAVES.\r\n\r\n     Human Skeleton found in Cave near Dusseldorf.\r\n     Its geological Position and probable Age.\r\n     Its abnormal and ape-like Characters.\r\n     Fossil Human Skull of the Engis Cave near Liege.\r\n     Professor Huxley's Description of these Skulls.\r\n     Comparison of each, with extreme Varieties of the native\r\n        Australian Race.\r\n     Range of Capacity in the Human and Simian Brains.\r\n     Skull from Borreby in Denmark.\r\n     Conclusions of Professor Huxley.\r\n     Bearing of the peculiar Characters of the Neanderthal Skull\r\n        on the Hypothesis of Transmutation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL HUMAN SKELETON OF THE NEANDERTHAL CAVE NEAR DUSSELDORF.\r\n\r\nBefore I speak more particularly of the opinions which anatomists have\r\nexpressed respecting the osteological characters of the human skull from\r\nEngis, near Liege, mentioned in the last chapter and described by Dr.\r\nSchmerling, it will be desirable to say something of the geological\r\nposition of another skull, or rather skeleton, which, on account of its\r\npeculiar conformation, has excited no small sensation in the last few\r\nyears. I allude to the skull found in 1857 in a cave situated in that\r\npart of the valley of the Dussel, near Dusseldorf, which is called the\r\nNeanderthal. The spot is a deep and narrow ravine about 70 English miles\r\nnorth-east of the region of the Liege caverns treated of in the last\r\nchapter, and close to the village and railway station of Hochdal between\r\nDusseldorf and Elberfeld. The cave occurs in the precipitous southern or\r\nleft side of the winding ravine, about sixty feet above the stream,\r\nand a hundred feet below the top of the cliff. The accompanying section\r\n(Figure 1.) will give the reader an idea of its position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1]\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Fuhlrott of Elberfeld first examined the cave, he found it to\r\nbe high enough to allow a man to enter. The width was 7 or 8 feet, and\r\nthe length or depth 15. I visited the spot in 1860, in company with Dr.\r\nFuhlrott, who had the kindness to come expressly from Elberfeld to be my\r\nguide, and who brought with him the original fossil skull, and a cast\r\nof the same, which he presented to me. In the interval of three years,\r\nbetween 1857 and 1860, the ledge of rock, f, on which the cave opened,\r\nand which was originally 20 feet wide, had been almost entirely quarried\r\naway, and, at the rate at which the work of dilapidation was proceeding,\r\nits complete destruction seemed near at hand.\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 1. SECTION OF THE NEANDERTHAL CAVE NEAR DUSSELDORF.\r\n\r\n  a. Cavern 60 feet above the Dussel, and 100 feet below the\r\n     surface of the country at c.\r\n  b. Loam covering the floor of the cave near the bottom of which\r\n     the human skeleton was found.\r\n  b, c. Rent connecting the cave with the upper surface of the\r\n     country.\r\n  d. Superficial sandy loam.\r\n  e. Devonian limestone.\r\n  f. Terrace, or ledge of rock.)\r\n\r\nIn the limestone are many fissures, one of which, still partially filled\r\nwith mud and stones, is represented in the section at a c as continuous\r\nfrom the cave to the upper surface of the country. Through this passage\r\nthe loam, and possibly the human body to which the bones belonged, may\r\nhave been washed into the cave below. The loam, which covered the uneven\r\nbottom of the cave, was sparingly mixed with rounded fragments of chert,\r\nand was very similar in composition to that covering the general surface\r\nof that region.\r\n\r\nThere was no crust of stalagmite overlying the mud in which the human\r\nskeleton was found, and no bones of other animals in the mud with the\r\nskeleton; but just before our visit in 1860 the tusk of a bear had\r\nbeen met with in some mud in a lateral embranchment of the cave, in a\r\nsituation precisely similar to b, Figure 1, and on a level corresponding\r\nwith that of the human skeleton. This tusk, shown us by the proprietor\r\nof the cave, was 2 1/2 inches long and quite perfect; but whether it was\r\nreferable to a recent or extinct species of bear, I could not determine.\r\n\r\nFrom a printed letter of Dr. Fuhlrott we learn that on removing the\r\nloam, which was five feet thick, from the cave, the human skull was\r\nfirst noticed near the entrance, and, further in, the other bones lying\r\nin the same horizontal plane. It is supposed that the skeleton was\r\ncomplete, but the workmen, ignorant of its value, scattered and lost\r\nmost of the bones, preserving only the larger ones.*\r\n\r\n     (* Fuhlrott, Letter to Professor Schaaffhausen, cited\r\n     \"Natural History Review\" Number 2 page 156. See also\r\n     \"Naturhistorischer Verein\" Bonn 1859.)\r\n\r\nThe cranium, which Dr. Fuhlrott showed me, was covered both on its outer\r\nand inner surface, and especially on the latter, with a profusion of\r\ndendritical crystallisations, and some other bones of the skeleton were\r\nornamented in the same way. These markings, as Dr. Hermann von Meyer\r\nobserves, afford no sure criterion of antiquity, for they have been\r\nobserved on Roman bones. Nevertheless, they are more common in bones\r\nthat have been long embedded in the earth. The skull and bones,\r\nmoreover, of the Neanderthal skeleton had lost so much of their animal\r\nmatter as to adhere strongly to the tongue, agreeing in this respect\r\nwith the ordinary condition of fossil remains of the Pleistocene period.\r\nOn the whole, I think it probable that this fossil may be of about the\r\nsame age as those found by Schmerling in the Liege caverns; but, as no\r\nother animal remains were found with it, there is no proof that it\r\nmay not be newer. Its position lends no countenance whatever to the\r\nsupposition of its being more ancient.\r\n\r\nWhen the skull and other parts of the skeleton were first exhibited at\r\na German scientific meeting at Bonn, in 1857, some doubts were\r\nexpressed by several naturalists, whether it was truly human. Professor\r\nSchaaffhausen, who, with the other experienced zoologists, did not share\r\nthese doubts, observed that the cranium, which included the frontal\r\nbone, both parietals, part of the squamous, and the upper third of the\r\noccipital, was of unusual size and thickness, the forehead narrow and\r\nvery low, and the projection of the supra-orbital ridges enormously\r\ngreat. He also stated that the absolute and relative length of the thigh\r\nbone, humerus, radius, and ulna, agreed well with the dimensions of a\r\nEuropean individual of like stature at the present day; but that the\r\nthickness of the bones was very extraordinary, and the elevations and\r\ndepressions for the attachment of muscles were developed in an unusual\r\ndegree. Some of the ribs, also, were of a singularly rounded shape and\r\nabrupt curvature, which was supposed to indicate great power in the\r\nthoracic muscles.*\r\n\r\n     (* Professor Schaaffhausen's \"Memoir\" translated \"Natural\r\n     History Review\" April 1861.)\r\n\r\nIn the same memoir, the Prussian anatomist remarks that the depression\r\nof the forehead (See Figure 3.), is not due to any artificial\r\nflattening, such as is practised in various modes by barbarous nations\r\nin the Old and New World, the skull being quite symmetrical, and showing\r\nno indication of counter-pressure at the occiput; whereas, according\r\nto Morton, in the Flat-heads of the Columbia, the frontal and parietal\r\nbones are always unsymmetrical.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Natural History Review\" Number 2 page 160.)\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Professor Schaaffhausen concluded that the individual\r\nto whom the Neanderthal skull belonged must have been distinguished by\r\nsmall cerebral development, and uncommon strength of corporeal frame.\r\n\r\nWhen on my return to England I showed the cast of the cranium to\r\nProfessor Huxley, he remarked at once that it was the most ape-like\r\nskull he had ever beheld. Mr. Busk, after giving a translation of\r\nProfessor Schaaffhausen's memoir in the \"Natural History Review,\" added\r\nsome valuable comments of his own on the characters in which this skull\r\napproached that of the gorilla and chimpanzee.\r\n\r\nProfessor Huxley afterwards studied the cast with the object of\r\nassisting me to give illustrations of it in this work, and in doing so\r\ndiscovered what had not previously been observed, that it was quite\r\nas abnormal in the shape of its occipital as in that of its frontal\r\nor superciliary region. Before citing his words on the subject, I will\r\noffer a few remarks on the Engis skull which the same anatomist has\r\ncompared with that of the Neanderthal. [10]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL SKULL OF THE ENGIS CAVE NEAR LIEGE.\r\n\r\nAmong six or seven human skeletons, portions of which were collected by\r\nDr. Schmerling from three or four caverns near Liege, embedded in the\r\nsame matrix with the remains of the elephant, rhinoceros, bear, hyaena,\r\nand other extinct quadrupeds, the most perfect skull, as I have before\r\nstated, was that of an adult individual found in the cavern of Engis.\r\nThis skull, Dr. Schmerling figured in his work, observing that it was\r\ntoo imperfect to enable the anatomist to determine the facial angle, but\r\nthat one might infer, from the narrowness of the frontal portion, that\r\nit belonged to an individual of small intellectual development. He\r\nspeculated on its Ethiopian affinities, but not confidently, observing\r\ntruly that it would require many more specimens to enable an anatomist\r\nto arrive at sound conclusions on such a point. M. Geoffroy St. Hilaire\r\nand other osteologists, who examined the specimen, denied that it\r\nresembled a negro's skull. When I saw the original in the museum at\r\nLiege, I invited Dr. Spring, one of the professors of the university, to\r\nwhom we are indebted for a valuable memoir on the human bones found in\r\nthe cavern of Chauvaux, near Namur, to have a cast made of this Engis\r\nskull. He not only had the kindness to comply with my request, but\r\nrendered a service to the scientific world by adding to the original\r\ncranium several detached fragments which Dr. Schmerling had obtained\r\nfrom Engis, and which were found to fit in exactly, so that the cast\r\nrepresented at Figure 2 is more complete than that given in the first\r\nplate of Schmerling's work. It exhibits on the right side the position\r\nof the auditory foramen (see Figure 6), which was not included in\r\nSchmerling's figure. Mr. Busk, when he saw this cast, remarked to\r\nme that, although the forehead was, as Schmerling had truly stated,\r\nsomewhat narrow, it might nevertheless be matched by the skulls of\r\nindividuals of European race, an observation since fully borne out by\r\nmeasurements, as will be seen in the sequel.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS BY PROFESSOR HUXLEY ON THE HUMAN SKULLS OF ENGIS AND THE\r\nNEANDERTHAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2]\r\n\r\n\"The Engis skull, as originally figured by Professor Schmerling, was in\r\na very imperfect state; but other fragments have since been added to it\r\nby the care of Dr. Spring, and the cast upon which my observations are\r\nbased (Figure 2) exhibits the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions,\r\nas far as the middle of the occipital foramen, with the squamous and\r\nmastoid portions of the right temporal bone entire, or nearly so, while\r\nthe left temporal bone is wanting. From the middle of the occipital\r\nforamen to the middle of the roof of each orbit, the base of the skull\r\nis destroyed, and the facial bones are entirely absent.\r\n\r\n\"The extreme length of the skull is 7.7 inches, and as its extreme\r\nbreadth is not more than 5.25, its form is decidedly dolichocephalic.\r\nAt the same time its height (4 3/4 inches from the plane of the\r\nglabello-occipital line (a d) to the vertex) is good, and the forehead\r\nis well arched; so that while the horizontal circumference of the skull\r\nis about 20 1/2 inches, the longitudinal arc from the nasal spine of\r\nthe frontal bone to the occipital protuberance (d) measures about 13 3/4\r\ninches. The transverse arc from one auditory foramen to the other across\r\nthe middle of the sagittal suture measures about 13 inches. The sagittal\r\nsuture (b c) is 5 1/2 inches in length. The superciliary prominences\r\nare well, but not excessively, developed, and are separated by a median\r\ndepression in the region of the glabella. They indicate large frontal\r\nsinuses. If a line joining the glabella and the occipital protuberance\r\n(a d) be made horizontal, no part of the occiput projects more than\r\n1/10th of an inch behind the posterior extremity of that line; and the\r\nupper edge of the auditory foramen is almost in contact with the same\r\nline, or rather with one drawn parallel to it on the outer surface of\r\nthe skull.\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 2. SIDE VIEW OF THE CAST OF PART OF A HUMAN SKULL\r\n  FOUND BY DR. SCHMERLING EMBEDDED AMONGST THE REMAINS OF\r\n  EXTINCT MAMMALIA IN THE CAVE OF ENGIS, NEAR LIEGE.\r\n\r\n  a. Superciliary ridge and glabella.\r\n  b. Coronal suture.\r\n  c. The apex of the lamboidal suture.\r\n  d. The occipital protuberance.)\r\n\r\n\"The Neanderthal skull, with which also I am acquainted only by means\r\nof Professor Schaaffhausen's drawings of an excellent cast and of\r\nphotographs, is so extremely different in appearance from the Engis\r\ncranium, that it might well be supposed to belong to a distinct race\r\nof mankind. It is 8 inches in extreme length and 5.75 inches in extreme\r\nbreadth, but only measures 3.4 inches from the glabello-occipital line\r\nto the vertex. The longitudinal arc, measured as above, is 12 inches;\r\nthe transverse arc cannot be exactly ascertained, in consequence of\r\nthe absence of the temporal bones, but was probably about the same, and\r\ncertainly exceeded 10 1/4 inches. The horizontal circumference is\r\n23 inches. This great circumference arises largely from the vast\r\ndevelopment of the superciliary ridges, which are occupied by great\r\nfrontal sinuses whose inferior apertures are displayed exceedingly well\r\nin one of Dr. Fuhlrott's photographs, and form a continuous transverse\r\nprominence, somewhat excavated in the middle line, across the lower part\r\nof the brows. In consequence of this structure, the forehead appears\r\nstill lower and more retreating than it really is. To an anatomical eye\r\nthe posterior part of the skull is even more striking than the anterior.\r\nThe occipital protuberance occupies the extreme posterior end of the\r\nskull when the glabello-occipital line is made horizontal, and so far\r\nfrom any part of the occipital region extending beyond it, this region\r\nof the skull slopes obliquely upward and forward, so that the lambdoidal\r\nsuture is situated well upon the upper surface of the cranium. At the\r\nsame time, notwithstanding the great length of the skull, the sagittal\r\nsuture is remarkably short (4 1/2 inches), and the squamosal suture is\r\nvery straight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3. Cast of Human Skull]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 3. SIDE VIEW OF THE CAST OF A PART OF A HUMAN SKULL\r\n  FROM A CAVE IN THE NEANDERTHAL, NEAR DUSSELDORF.\r\n\r\n  a. Superciliary ridge and glabella.\r\n  b. The coronal suture.\r\n  c. The apex of the lamboidal suture.\r\n  d. The occipital protuberance.)\r\n\r\n\"In human skulls, the superior curved ridge of the occipital bone and\r\nthe occipital protuberance correspond, approximatively, with the level\r\nof the tentorium and with the lateral sinuses, and consequently with the\r\ninferior limit of the posterior lobes of the brain. At first, I found\r\nsome difficulty in believing that a human brain could have its posterior\r\nlobes so flattened and diminished as must have been the case in the\r\nNeanderthal man, supposing the ordinary relation to obtain between the\r\nsuperior occipital ridges and the tentorium; but on my application,\r\nthrough Sir Charles Lyell, Dr. Fuhlrott, the possessor of the skull, was\r\ngood enough not only to ascertain the existence of the lateral sinuses\r\nin their ordinary position, but to send convincing proofs of the fact,\r\nin excellent photographic views of the interior of the skull, exhibiting\r\nclear indications of these sinuses.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt that, as Professor Schaaffhausen and Mr. Busk\r\nhave stated, this skull is the most brutal of all known human skulls,\r\nresembling those of the apes not only in the prodigious development of\r\nthe superciliary prominences and the forward extension of the orbits,\r\nbut still more in the depressed form of the brain-case, in the\r\nstraightness of the squamosal suture, and in the complete retreat of the\r\nocciput forwards and upward, from the superior occipital ridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.

The\r\n  occipital protuberance, or the point on the exterior of each skull\r\n  which corresponds roughly with the attachment of the tentorium, or\r\n  with the inferior boundary of the posterior cerebral lobes.)\r\n\r\n\"But the cranium, in its present condition, is stated by Professor\r\nSchaaffhausen to contain 1033.24 cubic centimetres of water, or, in\r\nother words, about 63 English cubic inches. As the entire skull could\r\nhardly have held less than 12 cubic inches more, its minimum capacity\r\nmay be estimated at 75 cubic inches. The most capacious healthy European\r\nskull yet measured had a capacity of 114 cubic inches, the smallest (as\r\nestimated by weight of brain) about 55 cubic inches, while, according to\r\nProfessor Schaaffhausen, some Hindoo skulls have as small a capacity as\r\nabout 46 cubic inches (27 ounces of water). The largest cranium of\r\nany Gorilla yet measured contained 34.5 cubic inches. The Neanderthal\r\ncranium stands, therefore, in capacity, very nearly on a level with\r\nthe mean of the two human extremes, and very far above the pithecoid\r\nmaximum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5. Skull]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 5. SKULL ASSOCIATED WITH GROUND FLINT IMPLEMENTS,\r\n   FROM A TUMULUS AT BORREBY IN DENMARK, AFTER A CAMERA LUCIDA\r\n   DRAWING BY MR. G.

One of the Borreby skulls in particular (Figure 5)\r\nhas remarkably projecting superciliary ridges, a retreating forehead, a\r\nlow flattened vertex, and an occiput which shelves upward and forward.\r\nBut the skull is relatively higher and broader, or more brachycephalic,\r\nthe sagittal suture longer, and the superciliary ridges less projecting,\r\nthan in the Neanderthal skull. Nevertheless, there is, without doubt,\r\nmuch resemblance in character between the two skulls--a circumstance\r\nwhich is the more interesting, since the other Borreby skulls have\r\nbetter foreheads and less prominent superciliary ridges, and exhibit\r\naltogether a higher conformation.\r\n\r\n\"The Borreby skulls belong to the stone period of Denmark, and the\r\npeople to whom they appertained were probably either contemporaneous\r\nwith, or later than, the makers of the 'refuse-heaps' of that country.\r\nIn other words, they were subsequent to the last great physical changes\r\nof Europe, and were contemporaries of the urus and bison, not of the\r\nElephas primigenius, Rhinoceros tichorhinus, and Hyaena spelaea.\r\n\r\n\"Supposing for a moment, what is not proven, that the Neanderthal skull\r\nbelonged to a race allied to the Borreby people and was as modern\r\nas they, it would be separated by as great a distance of time as of\r\nanatomical character from the Engis skull, and the possibility of its\r\nbelonging to a distinct race from the latter might reasonably appear to\r\nbe greatly heightened.\r\n\r\n\"To prevent the possibility of reasoning in a vicious circle, however,\r\nI thought it would be well to endeavour to ascertain what amount of\r\ncranial variation is to be found in a pure race at the present day; and\r\nas the natives of Southern and Western Australia are probably as pure\r\nand homogeneous in blood, customs, and language, as any race of savages\r\nin existence, I turned to them, the more readily as the Hunterian museum\r\ncontains a very fine collection of such skulls.\r\n\r\n\"I soon found it possible to select from among these crania two\r\n(connected by all sorts of intermediate gradations), the one of which\r\nshould very nearly resemble the Engis skull, while the other should\r\nsomewhat less closely approximate the Neanderthal cranium in form, size,\r\nand proportions. And at the same time others of these skulls presented\r\nno less remarkable affinities with the low type of Borreby skull.\r\n\r\n\"That the resemblances to which I allude are by no means of a merely\r\nsuperficial character, is shown by the accompanying diagram (Figure 6),\r\nwhich gives the contours of the two ancient and of one of the Australian\r\nskulls, and by the following table of measurements.\r\n\r\nTABLE 5/1.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1: TYPE OF SKULL.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 2 (A): The horizontal circumference in the plane of a line\r\njoining the glabella with the occipital protuberance.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 3 (B): The longitudinal arc from the nasal depression along the\r\nmiddle line of the skull to the occipital tuberosity.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 4 (C): From the level of the glabello-occipital line on each\r\nside, across the middle of the sagittal suture to the same point on the\r\nopposite side.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 5 (D): The vertical height from the glabello-occipital line.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 6 (E): The extreme longitudinal measurement.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 7 (F): The extreme transverse measurement.*\r\n\r\n     (* I have taken the glabello-occipital line as a base in\r\n     these measurements, simply because it enables me to compare\r\n     all the skulls, whether fragments or entire, together. The\r\n     greatest circumference of the English skull lies in a plane\r\n     considerably above that of the glabello-occipital line, and\r\n     amounts to 22 inches.)\r\n\r\n  Engis    : 20 1/2: 13 3/4: 12 1/2: 4 3/4: 7 3/4: 5 1/4.\r\n  Australian,\r\n     Number 1: 20 1/2: 13  : 12  : 4 3/4: 7 1/2: 5 4/10.\r\n  Australian,\r\n     Number 2: 22  : 12 1/2: 10 3/4: 3 8/10: 7.9: 5 3/4.\r\n  Neanderthal: 23  : 12  : 10  : 3 3/4: 8  : 5 3/4.\r\n\r\n\"The question whether the Engis skull has rather the character of one\r\nof the high races or of one of the lower has been much disputed, but the\r\nfollowing measurements of an English skull, noted in the catalogue of\r\nthe Hunterian museum as typically Caucasian (see Figure 4) will serve to\r\nshow that both sides may be right, and that cranial measurements alone\r\nafford no safe indication of race.\r\n\r\n  English  : 21  : 13 3/4: 12 1/2: 4 4/10: 7 7/8: 5 1/3.\r\n\r\n\"In making the preceding statement, it must be clearly understood that I\r\nneither desire to affirm that the Engis and Neanderthal skulls belong to\r\nthe Australian race, nor to assert even that the ancient skulls belong\r\nto one and the same race, so far as race is measured by language, colour\r\nof skin, or character of hair. Against the conclusion that they are of\r\nthe same race as the Australians various minor anatomical differences\r\nof the ancient skulls, such as the great development of the frontal\r\nsinuses, might be urged; while against the supposition of either\r\nthe identity, or the diversity, of race of the two arises the known\r\nindependence of the variation of cranium on the one hand, and of hair,\r\ncolour, and language on the other.\r\n\r\n\"But the amount of variation of the Borreby skulls, and the fact that\r\nthe skulls of one of the purest and most homogeneous of existing races\r\nof men can be proved to differ from one another in the same characters,\r\nthough perhaps not quite to the same extent, as the Engis and\r\nNeanderthal skulls, seem to me to prohibit any cautious reasoner from\r\naffirming the latter to have been necessarily of distinct races.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6. Outlines of Skulls]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 6. OUTLINES OF THE SKULL FROM THE NEANDERTHAL,\r\n   OF AN AUSTRALIAN SKULL FROM PORT ADELAIDE, AND OF THE\r\n   SKULL FROM THE CAVE OF ENGIS, DRAWN TO THE SAME ABSOLUTE\r\n   LENGTH, IN ORDER THE BETTER TO CONTRAST THEIR PROPORTIONS.\r\n\r\n  a. The glabella.\r\n  b. The occipital protuberance, or the point on the exterior\r\n     of each skull which corresponds roughly with the attachment\r\n     of the tentorium, or with the inferior boundary of the\r\n     posterior cerebral lobes.\r\n   e. The position of the auditory foramen of the Engis skull.)\r\n\r\n\"The marked resemblances between the ancient skulls and their modern\r\nAustralian analogues, however, have a profound interest, when it is\r\nrecollected that the stone axe is as much the weapon and the implement\r\nof the modern as of the ancient savage; that the former turns the bones\r\nof the kangaroo and of the emu to the same account as the latter did the\r\nbones of the deer and the urus; that the Australian heaps up the shells\r\nof devoured shellfish in mounds which represent the \"refuse-heaps\" or\r\n\"Kjokkenmodding,\" of Denmark; and, finally, that, on the other side of\r\nTorres Straits, a race akin to the Australians are among the few people\r\nwho now build their houses on pile-works, like those of the ancient\r\nSwiss lakes.\r\n\r\n\"That this amount of resemblance in habit and in the conditions\r\nof existence is accompanied by as close a resemblance in cranial\r\nconfiguration, illustrates on a great scale that what Cuvier\r\ndemonstrated of the animals of the Nile valley is no less true of men;\r\ncircumstances remaining similar, the savage varies little more, it would\r\nseem, than the ibis or the crocodile, especially if we take into account\r\nthe enormous extent of the time over which our knowledge of man\r\nnow extends, as compared with that measured by the duration of the\r\nsepulchres of Egypt.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, the comparatively large cranial capacity of the Neanderthal\r\nskull, overlaid though it may be by pithecoid bony walls, and the\r\ncompletely human proportions of the accompanying limb-bones, together\r\nwith the very fair development of the Engis skull, clearly indicate that\r\nthe first traces of the primordial stock whence Man has proceeded need\r\nno longer be sought, by those who entertain any form of the doctrine of\r\nprogressive development, in the newest Tertiaries; but that they may\r\nbe looked for in an epoch more distant from the age of the Elephas\r\nprimigenius than that is from us.\"\r\n\r\nThe two skulls which form the subject of the preceding comments and\r\nillustrations have given rise to nearly an equal amount of surprise for\r\nopposite reasons; that of Engis because being so unequivocally ancient,\r\nit approached so near to the highest or Caucasian type; that of the\r\nNeanderthal, because, having no such decided claims to antiquity,\r\nit departs so widely from the normal standard of humanity. Professor\r\nHuxley's observation regarding the wide range of variation, both as\r\nto shape and capacity, in the skulls of so pure a race as the native\r\nAustralian, removes to no small extent this supposed anomaly, assuming\r\nwhat though not proved is very probable, that both varieties co-existed\r\nin the Pleistocene period in Western Europe.\r\n\r\nAs to the Engis skull, we must remember that although associated with\r\nthe elephant, rhinoceros, bear, tiger, and hyaena, all of extinct\r\nspecies, it nevertheless is also accompanied by a bear, stag, wolf, fox,\r\nbeaver, and many other quadrupeds of species still living. Indeed many\r\neminent palaeontologists, and among them Professor Pictet, think that,\r\nnumerically considered, the larger portion of the mammalian fauna\r\nagrees specifically with that of our own period, so that we are scarcely\r\nentitled to feel surprised if we find human races of the Pleistocene\r\nepoch undistinguishable from some living ones. It would merely tend to\r\nshow that Man has been as constant in his osteological characters as\r\nmany other mammalia now his contemporaries. The expectation of always\r\nmeeting with a lower type of human skull, the older the formation in\r\nwhich it occurs, is based on the theory of progressive development, and\r\nit may prove to be sound; nevertheless we must remember that as yet we\r\nhave no distinct geological evidence that the appearance of what\r\nare called the inferior races of mankind has always preceded in\r\nchronological order that of the higher races.\r\n\r\nIt is now admitted that the differences between the brain of the highest\r\nraces of Man and that of the lowest,* though less in degree, are of the\r\nsame order as those which separate the human from the simian brain; and\r\nthe same rule holds good in regard to the shape of the skull.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Natural History Review\" 1861 page 8.)\r\n\r\nThe average Negro skull differs from that of the European in having a\r\nmore receding forehead, more prominent superciliary ridges, and more\r\nlargely developed prominences and furrows for the attachment of muscles;\r\nthe face also, and its lines, are larger proportionally. The brain is\r\nsomewhat less voluminous on the average in the lower races of mankind,\r\nits convolutions rather less complicated, and those of the two\r\nhemispheres more symmetrical, in all which points an approach is made\r\nto the simian type. It will also be seen, by reference to the late Dr.\r\nMorton's works, and by the foregoing statements of Professor Huxley,\r\nthat the range of size or capacity between the highest and lowest human\r\nbrain is greater than that between the highest simian and lowest human\r\nbrain; but the Neanderthal skull, although in several respects it is\r\nmore ape-like than any human skull previously discovered, is, in regard\r\nto volume, by no means contemptible.\r\n\r\nEminent anatomists have shown that in the average proportions of some of\r\nthe bones the Negro differs from the European, and that in most of\r\nthese characters, he makes a slightly nearer approach to the anthropoid\r\nquadrumana;* but Professor Schaaffhausen has pointed out that in these\r\nproportions the Neanderthal skeleton does not differ from the ordinary\r\nstandard, so that the skeleton by no means indicates a transition\r\nbetween Homo and Pithecus. (* \"The inferior races of mankind exhibit\r\nproportions which are in many respects intermediate between the higher,\r\nor European, orders, and the monkeys. In the Negro, for instance, the\r\nstature is less than in the European. The cranium, as is well known,\r\nbears a small proportion to the face. Of the extremities the upper are\r\nproportionately longer, and there is, in both upper and lower, a less\r\nmarked preponderance of the proximal over the distal segments. For\r\ninstance, in the Negro, the thigh and arm are rather shorter than in\r\nthe European; the leg is actually of equal length in both races, and is\r\ntherefore, relatively, a little longer in the Negro; the fore-arm in the\r\nlatter is actually, as well as relatively, a little longer; the foot\r\nis an eighth, and the hand a twelfth longer than in the European. It is\r\nwell known that the foot is less well formed in the Negro than in the\r\nEuropean. The arch of the instep, the perfect conformation of which is\r\nessential to steadiness and ease of gait, is less elevated in the former\r\nthan in the latter. The foot is thereby rendered flatter as well as\r\nlonger, more nearly resembling the monkey's, between which and the\r\nEuropean there is a marked difference in this particular.\"--From \"A\r\nTreatise on the Human Skeleton\" by Dr. Humphry, Lecturer on Surgery and\r\nAnatomy in the Cambridge University Medical School, page 91.)\r\n\r\nThere is doubtless, as shown in the diagram Figure 4, a nearer\r\nresemblance in the outline of the Neanderthal skull to that of a\r\nchimpanzee than had ever been observed before in any human cranium; and\r\nProfessor Huxley's description of the occipital region shows that the\r\nresemblance is not confined to the mere excessive prominence of the\r\nsuperciliary ridges.\r\n\r\nThe direct bearing of the ape-like character of the Neanderthal skull on\r\nLamarck's doctrine of progressive development and transmutation, or on\r\nthat modification of it which has of late been so ably advocated by\r\nMr. Darwin, consists in this, that the newly observed deviation from\r\na normal standard of human structure is not in a casual or random\r\ndirection, but just what might have been anticipated if the laws of\r\nvariation were such as the transmutationists require. For if we conceive\r\nthe cranium to be very ancient, it exemplifies a less advanced stage of\r\nprogressive development and improvement. If it be a comparatively modern\r\nrace, owing its peculiarities of conformation to degeneracy, it is\r\nan illustration of what botanists call \"atavism,\" or the tendency of\r\nvarieties to revert to an ancestral type, which type, in proportion\r\nto its antiquity, would be of lower grade. To this hypothesis, of a\r\ngenealogical connection between Man and the lower animals, I shall again\r\nallude in the concluding chapters.

Boucher de Perthes at Abbeville.\r\n   Flint Implements found also at St. Acheul, near Amiens.\r\n   Curiosity awakened by the systematic Exploration of the Brixham Cave.\r\n   Flint Knives in same, with Bones of extinct Mammalia.\r\n   Superposition of Deposits in the Cave.\r\n   Visits of English and French Geologists to Abbeville and Amiens.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEISTOCENE ALLUVIUM CONTAINING FLINT IMPLEMENTS IN THE VALLEY OF THE\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\nThroughout a large part of Europe we find at moderate elevations above\r\nthe present river-channels, usually at a height of less than 40 feet,\r\nbut sometimes much higher, beds of gravel, sand, and loam containing\r\nbones of the elephant, rhinoceros, horse, ox, and other quadrupeds, some\r\nof extinct, others of living, species, belonging for the most part to\r\nthe fauna already alluded to in the fourth chapter as characteristic\r\nof the interior of caverns. The greater part of these deposits contain\r\nfluviatile shells, and have undoubtedly been accumulated in ancient\r\nriver-beds. These old channels have long since been dry, the streams\r\nwhich once flowed in them having shifted their position, deepening the\r\nvalleys, and often widening them on one side.\r\n\r\nIt has naturally been asked, if Man co-existed with the extinct species\r\nof the caves, why were his remains and the works of his hands never\r\nembedded outside the caves in ancient river-gravel containing the same\r\nfossil fauna? Why should it be necessary for the geologist to resort\r\nfor evidence of the antiquity of our race to the dark recesses of\r\nunderground vaults and tunnels which may have served as places of refuge\r\nor sepulture to a succession of human beings and wild animals, and where\r\nfloods may have confounded together in one breccia the memorials of\r\nthe fauna of more than one epoch? Why do we not meet with a similar\r\nassemblage of the relics of Man, and of living and extinct quadrupeds,\r\nin places where the strata can be thoroughly scrutinised in the light of\r\nday?\r\n\r\nRecent researches have at length demonstrated that such memorials, so\r\nlong sought for in vain, do in fact exist, and their recognition is\r\nthe chief cause of the more favourable reception now given to the\r\nconclusions which MM. Tournal, Christol, Schmerling, and others, arrived\r\nat thirty years ago respecting the fossil contents of caverns. [12]\r\n\r\nA very important step in this new direction was made thirteen years\r\nafter the publication of Schmerling's researches, by M. Boucher de\r\nPerthes, who found in ancient alluvium at Abbeville, in Picardy, some\r\nflint implements, the relative antiquity of which was attested by their\r\ngeological position. The antiquarian knowledge of their discoverer\r\nenabled him to recognise in their rude and peculiar type a character\r\ndistinct from that of the polished stone weapons of a later period,\r\nusually called \"celts.\" In the first volume of his \"Antiquites\r\nCeltiques,\" published in 1847, M. Boucher de Perthes styled these older\r\ntools \"antediluvian,\" because they came from the lowest beds of a series\r\nof ancient alluvial strata bordering the valley of the Somme, which\r\ngeologists had termed \"diluvium.\" He had begun to collect these\r\nimplements in 1841. From that time they had been annually dug out of the\r\ndrift or deposits of gravel and sand, of which fine sections were laid\r\nopen from 20 to 35 feet in depth, whenever excavations were made in\r\nrepairing the fortifications of Abbeville; or as often as flints were\r\nwanted for the roads, or loam for making bricks. For years previously\r\nbones of quadrupeds of the genera elephant, rhinoceros, bear, hyaena,\r\nstag, ox, horse, and others, had been collected there, and sent from\r\ntime to time to Paris to be examined and named by Cuvier, who had\r\ndescribed them in his Ossements Fossiles. A correct account of the\r\nassociated flint tools and of their position was given in 1847 by M.\r\nBoucher de Perthes in his work above cited, and they were stated to\r\noccur at various depths, often 20 or 30 feet from the surface, in sand\r\nand gravel, especially in those strata which were nearly in contact with\r\nthe subjacent white Chalk. But the scientific world had no faith in\r\nthe statement that works of art, however rude, had been met with in\r\nundisturbed beds of such antiquity. Few geologists visited Abbeville\r\nin winter, when the sand-pits were open, and when they might have\r\nopportunities of verifying the sections, and judging whether the\r\ninstruments had really been embedded by natural causes in the same\r\nstrata with the bones of the mammoth, rhinoceros, and other extinct\r\nmammalia. Some of the tools figured in the \"Antiquites Celtiques\" were\r\nso rudely shaped, that many imagined them to have owed their peculiar\r\nforms to accidental fracture in a river's bed; others suspected frauds\r\non the part of the workmen, who might have fabricated them for sale, or\r\nthat the gravel had been disturbed, and that the worked flints had got\r\nmingled with the bones of the mammoth long after that animal and its\r\nassociates had disappeared from the earth.\r\n\r\nNo one was more sceptical than the late eminent physician of Amiens, Dr.\r\nRigollot, who had long before (in the year 1819) written a memoir on the\r\nfossil mammalia of the valley of the Somme. He was at length induced to\r\nvisit Abbeville, and, having inspected the collection of M. Boucher de\r\nPerthes, returned home resolved to look for himself for flint tools in\r\nthe gravel-pits near Amiens. There, accordingly, at a distance of about\r\n30 miles from Abbeville, he immediately found abundance of similar flint\r\nimplements, precisely the same in the rudeness of their make, and the\r\nsame in their geological position; some of them in gravel nearly on a\r\nlevel with the Somme, others in similar deposits resting on Chalk at a\r\nheight of about 90 feet above the river.\r\n\r\nDr. Rigollot having in the course of four years obtained several hundred\r\nspecimens of these tools, most of them from St. Acheul in the south-east\r\nsuburbs of Amiens, lost no time in communicating an account of them to\r\nthe scientific world, in a memoir illustrated by good figures of the\r\nworked flints and careful sections of the beds. These sections were\r\nexecuted by M. Buteux, an engineer well qualified for the task, who had\r\nwritten a good description of the geology of Picardy. Dr. Rigollot, in\r\nthis memoir, pointed out most clearly that it was not in the vegetable\r\nsoil, nor in the brick-earth with land and freshwater shells next below,\r\nbut in the lower beds of coarse flint-gravel, usually 12, 20, or 25 feet\r\nbelow the surface, that the implements were met with, just as they had\r\nbeen previously stated by M. Boucher de Perthes to occur at Abbeville.\r\nThe conclusion, therefore, which was legitimately deduced from all the\r\nfacts, was that the flint tools and their fabricators were coeval with\r\nthe extinct mammalia embedded in the same strata.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIXHAM CAVE, NEAR TORQUAY, DEVONSHIRE.\r\n\r\nFour years after the appearance of Dr. Rigollot's paper, a sudden\r\nchange of opinion was brought about in England respecting the probable\r\nco-existence, at a former period, of Man and many extinct mammalia, in\r\nconsequence of the results obtained from a careful exploration of a cave\r\nat Brixham, near Torquay, in Devonshire. As the new views very generally\r\nadopted by English geologists had no small influence on the subsequent\r\nprogress of opinion in France, I shall interrupt my account of the\r\nresearches made in the valley of the Somme, by a brief notice of those\r\nwhich were carried on in 1858 in Devonshire with more than usual care\r\nand scientific method. Dr. Buckland, in his celebrated work, entitled\r\n\"Reliquiae Diluvianae,\" published in 1823, in which he treated of the\r\norganic remains contained in caves, fissures, and \"diluvial gravel\" in\r\nEngland, had given a clear statement of the results of his own original\r\nobservations, and had declared that none of the human bones or stone\r\nimplements met with by him in any of the caverns could be considered\r\nto be as old as the mammoth and other extinct quadrupeds. Opinions in\r\nharmony with this conclusion continued until very lately to be generally\r\nin vogue in England; although about the time that Schmerling was\r\nexploring the Liege caves, the Reverend Mr. McEnery, a Catholic priest,\r\nresiding near Torquay, had found in a cave one mile east of that town,\r\ncalled \"Kent's Hole,\" in red loam covered with stalagmite, not only\r\nbones of the mammoth, tichorhine rhinoceros, hippopotamus, cave-bear,\r\nand other mammalia, but several remarkable flint tools, some of which he\r\nsupposed to be of great antiquity, while there were also remains of Man\r\nin the same cave of a later date.*\r\n\r\n     (* The manuscript and plates prepared for a joint memoir on\r\n     Kent's Hole, by Mr. McEnery and Dr. Buckland, have recently\r\n     been published by Mr. Vivian of Torquay, from which, as well\r\n     as from some of the unprinted manuscript, I infer that Mr.\r\n     McEnery only refrained out of deference to Dr. Buckland from\r\n     declaring his belief in the contemporaneousness of certain\r\n     flint implements of an antique type and the bones of extinct\r\n     animals. Two of these implements from Kent's Hole, figured\r\n     in Plate 12 of the posthumous work above alluded to,\r\n     approach very closely in form and size to the common\r\n     Abbeville implements.)\r\n\r\nAbout ten years afterwards, in a \"Memoir on the Geology of South\r\nDevon,\" published in 1842 by the Geological Society of London,* an able\r\ngeologist, Mr. Godwin-Austen, declared that he had obtained in the same\r\ncave (Kent's Hole) works of Man from undisturbed loam or clay, under\r\nstalagmite, mingled with the remains of extinct animals, and that all\r\nthese must have been introduced \"before the stalagmite flooring had been\r\nformed.\" He maintained that such facts could not be explained away by\r\nthe hypothesis of sepulture, as in Dr. Buckland's well-known case of\r\nthe human skeleton of Paviland, because in the Devon cave the flint\r\nimplements were widely distributed through the loam, and lay beneath the\r\nstalagmite.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Transactions of the Geological Society\" 2nd series\r\n     volume 6 page 444.)\r\n\r\nAs the osseous and other contents of Kent's Hole had, by repeated\r\ndiggings, been thrown into much confusion, it was thought desirable in\r\n1858, when a new and intact bone-cave was discovered at Brixham,\r\nabout four miles south of Torquay, to have a thorough and systematic\r\nexamination made of it. The Royal Society, chiefly at the instance of\r\nDr. Falconer, made two grants towards defraying the expenses, and\r\nMiss Burdett-Coutts contributed liberally towards the same object. A\r\ncommittee of geologists was charged with the investigations, among whom\r\nDr. Falconer and Mr. Prestwich took a prominent part, visiting Torquay\r\nwhile the excavations were in progress. Mr. Pengelly, another member\r\nof the committee, well qualified for the task by nearly twenty years'\r\nprevious experience in cave explorations, zealously directed and\r\nsuperintended the work. By him, in 1859, I was conducted through\r\nthe subterranean galleries after they had been cleared out; and Dr.\r\nFalconer, who was also at Torquay, showed me the numerous fossils which\r\nhad been discovered, and which he was then studying, all numbered and\r\nlabelled, with reference to a journal in which the geological position\r\nof each specimen was recorded with scrupulous care.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the existence of this suite of caverns near the sea at\r\nBrixham was made accidentally by the roof of one of them being broken\r\nthrough in quarrying. None of the four external openings now exposed\r\nto view in steep cliffs or in the sloping side of a valley were visible\r\nbefore the breccia and earthy matter which blocked them up were removed\r\nduring the late exploration. According to a ground-plan drawn up by\r\nProfessor Ramsay, it appears that some of the passages which run nearly\r\nnorth and south are fissures connected with the vertical dislocation of\r\nthe rocks, while another set, running nearly east and west, are tunnels,\r\nwhich have the appearance of having been to a great extent hollowed out\r\nby the action of running water. The central or main entrance, leading to\r\nwhat is called the \"reindeer gallery,\" because a perfect antler of that\r\nanimal was found sticking in the stalagmitic floor, is 95 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, being also 78 above the bottom of the adjoining\r\nvalley. The united length of the galleries which were cleared out\r\namounted to several hundred feet. Their width never exceeded 8 feet.\r\nThey were sometimes filled up to the roof with mud, but occasionally\r\nthere was a considerable space between the roof and floor. The latter,\r\nin the case of the fissure-caves, was covered with stalagmite, but\r\nin the tunnels it was usually free from any such incrustation. The\r\nfollowing was the general succession of the deposits forming the\r\ncontents of the underground passages and channels:--\r\n\r\nFirst. At the top, a layer of stalagmite varying in thickness from 1 to\r\n15 inches, which sometimes contained bones, such as the reindeer's horn,\r\nalready mentioned, and an entire humerus of the cave-bear.\r\n\r\nSecondly. Next below, loam or bone-earth, of an ochreous red colour,\r\nwith angular stones and some pebbles, from 2 to 13 feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nThirdly. At the bottom of all, gravel with many rounded pebbles in\r\nit. This was everywhere removed so long as the tunnels which narrowed\r\ndownwards were wide enough to be worked. It proved to be almost entirely\r\nbarren of fossils.\r\n\r\nThe mammalia obtained from the bone-earth consisted of Elephas\r\nprimigenius, or mammoth; Rhinoceros tichorhinus; Ursus spelaeus; Hyaena\r\nspelaea; Felis spelaea, or the cave-lion; Cervus tarandus, or the\r\nreindeer; a species of horse, ox, and several rodents, and others not\r\nyet determined.\r\n\r\nNo human bones were obtained anywhere during these excavations, but many\r\nflint knives, chiefly from the lowest part of the bone-earth; and one of\r\nthe most perfect lay at the depth of 13 feet from the surface, and was\r\ncovered with bone-earth of that thickness. Neglecting the less perfect\r\nspecimens, some of which were met with even in the lowest gravel,\r\nabout fifteen knives, recognised as artificially formed by the most\r\nexperienced antiquaries, were taken from the bone-earth, and usually\r\nfrom near the bottom. Such knives, considered apart from the associated\r\nmammalia, afford in themselves no safe criterion of antiquity, as\r\nthey might belong to any part of the age of stone, similar tools\r\nbeing sometimes met with in tumuli posterior in date to the era of the\r\nintroduction of bronze. But the contemporaneity of those at Brixham with\r\nthe extinct animals is demonstrated not only by the occurrence at one\r\npoint in overlying stalagmite of the bone of a cave-bear, but also\r\nby the discovery at the same level in the bone-earth, and in close\r\nproximity to a very perfect flint tool, of the entire left hind-leg of\r\na cave-bear. This specimen, which was shown me by Dr. Falconer and Mr.\r\nPengelly, was exhumed from the earthy deposit in the reindeer gallery,\r\nnear its junction with the flint-knife gallery, at the distance of about\r\nsixty-five feet from the main entrance. The mass of earth containing\r\nit was removed entire, and the matrix cleared away carefully by Dr.\r\nFalconer in the presence of Mr. Pengelly. Every bone was in its natural\r\nplace, the femur, tibia, fibula, ankle-bone, or astragalus, all in\r\njuxtaposition. Even the patella or detached bone of the knee-pan was\r\nsearched for, and not in vain. Here, therefore, we have evidence of an\r\nentire limb not having been washed in a fossil state out of an older\r\nalluvium, and then swept afterwards into a cave, so as to be mingled\r\nwith flint implements, but having been introduced when clothed with\r\nits flesh, or at least when it had the separate bones bound together by\r\ntheir natural ligaments, and in that state buried in mud.\r\n\r\nIf they were not all of contemporary date, it is clear from this case,\r\nand from the humerus of the Ursus spelaeus, before cited, as found in\r\na floor of stalagmite, that the bear lived after the flint tools were\r\nmanufactured, or in other words, that Man in this district preceded the\r\ncave-bear.\r\n\r\nA glance at the position of Windmill Hill, in which the caverns are\r\nsituated, and a brief survey of the valleys which bound it on three\r\nsides, are enough to satisfy a geologist that the drainage and\r\ngeographical features of this region have undergone great changes since\r\nthe gravel and bone-earth were carried by streams into the subterranean\r\ncavities above described. Some worn pebbles of haematite, in particular,\r\ncan only have come from their nearest parent rock, at a period when the\r\nvalleys immediately adjoining the caves were much shallower than they\r\nnow are. The reddish loam in which the bones are embedded is such as\r\nmay be seen on the surface of limestone in the neighbourhood, but the\r\ncurrents which were formerly charged with such mud must have run at a\r\nlevel 78 feet above that of the stream now flowing in the same valley.\r\nIt was remarked by Mr. Pengelly that the stones and bones in the loam\r\nhad their longest axes parallel to the direction of the tunnels and\r\nfissures, showing that they were deposited by the action of a stream.*\r\n\r\n     (* Pengelly, \"Geologist\" volume 4 1861 page 153.)\r\n\r\nIt appears that so long as the flowing water had force enough to propel\r\nstony fragments, no layer of fine mud could accumulate, and so long as\r\nthere was a regular current capable of carrying in fine mud and bones,\r\nno superficial crust of stalagmite. In some passages, as before stated,\r\nstalagmite was wanting, while in one place seven or eight alternations\r\nof stalagmite and loam were observed, seeming to indicate a prevalence\r\nof more rainy seasons, succeeded by others, when the water was for\r\na time too low to flood the area where the calcareous incrustation\r\naccumulated.\r\n\r\nIf the regular sequence of the three deposits of pebbles, mud, and\r\nstalagmite was the result of the causes above explained, the order\r\nof superposition would be constant, yet we could not be sure that the\r\ngravel in one passage might not sometimes be coeval with the bone-earth\r\nor stalagmite in another.\r\n\r\nIf therefore the flint knives had not been very widely dispersed, and if\r\none of them had not been at the bottom of the bone-earth, close to\r\nthe leg of the bear above described, their antiquity relatively to the\r\nextinct mammalia might have been questioned. No coprolites were found in\r\nthe Brixham excavations, and very few gnawed bones. These few may have\r\nbeen brought from some distance before they reached their place of\r\nrest. Upon the whole, the same conclusion which Dr. Schmerling came to,\r\nrespecting the filling up of the caverns near Liege, seems applicable to\r\nthe caves of Brixham.\r\n\r\nDr. Falconer, after aiding in the investigations above alluded to near\r\nTorquay, stopped at Abbeville on his way to Sicily, in the autumn of\r\n1858, and saw there the collection of M. Boucher de Perthes. Being at\r\nonce satisfied that the flints called hatchets had really been fashioned\r\nby the hand of Man, he urged Mr. Prestwich, by letter, thoroughly to\r\nexplore the geology of the valley of the Somme. This he accordingly\r\naccomplished, in company with Mr. John Evans [13], of the Society\r\nof Antiquaries, and, before his return that same year, succeeded in\r\ndissipating all doubts from the minds of his geological friends by\r\nextracting, with his own hands, from a bed of undisturbed gravel, at St.\r\nAcheul, a well-shaped flint hatchet. This implement was buried in the\r\ngravel at a depth of 17 feet from the surface, and was lying on its flat\r\nside. There were no signs of vertical rents in the enveloping matrix,\r\nnor in the overlying beds of sand and loam, in which were many land and\r\nfreshwater shells; so that it was impossible to imagine that the tool\r\nhad gradually worked its way downwards, as some had suggested, through\r\nthe incumbent soil, into an older formation.*\r\n\r\n     (* Prestwich, \"Proceedings of the Royal Society\" 1859 and\r\n     \"Philosophical Transactions\" 1860.)\r\n\r\nThere was no one in England whose authority deserved to have so much\r\nweight in overcoming incredulity in regard to the antiquity of the\r\nimplements in question. For Mr. Prestwich, besides having published a\r\nseries of important memoirs on the Tertiary formations of Europe, had\r\ndevoted many years specially to the study of the drift and its organic\r\nremains. His report, therefore, to the Royal Society, accompanied by a\r\nphotograph showing the position of the flint tool in situ before it was\r\nremoved from its matrix, not only satisfied many inquirers, but induced\r\nothers to visit Abbeville and Amiens; and one of these, Mr. Flower, who\r\naccompanied Mr. Prestwich on his second excursion to St. Acheul, in June\r\n1859, succeeded, by digging into the bank of gravel, in disinterring,\r\nat the depth of 22 feet from the surface, a fine, symmetrically-shaped\r\nweapon of an oval form, lying in and beneath strata which were observed\r\nby many witnesses to be perfectly undisturbed.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 16\r\n     1860 page 190.)\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, in the year 1859, I visited the same pits, and\r\nobtained seventy flint tools, one of which was taken out while I was\r\npresent, though I did not see it before it had fallen from the matrix.\r\nI expressed my opinion in favour of the antiquity of the flint tools to\r\nthe meeting of the British Association at Aberdeen, in the same year.*\r\n\r\n     (* See \"Report of British Association\" for 1859. )\r\n\r\nOn my way through Rouen, I stated my convictions on this subject to\r\nM. George Pouchet, who immediately betook himself to St. Acheul,\r\ncommissioned by the municipality of Rouen, and did not quit the pits\r\ntill he had seen one of the hatchets extracted from gravel in its\r\nnatural position.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Actes du Musee d'Histoire Naturelle de Rouen\" 1860 page\r\n     33.)\r\n\r\nM. Gaudry also gave the following account of his researches in the same\r\nyear to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris. \"The great point was\r\nnot to leave the workmen for a single instant, and to satisfy oneself\r\nby actual inspection whether the hatchets were found in situ. I caused a\r\ndeep excavation to be made, and found nine hatchets, most distinctly\r\nin situ in the diluvium, associated with teeth of Equus fossilis and a\r\nspecies of Bos, different from any now living, and similar to that of\r\nthe diluvium and of caverns.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Comptes rendus\" September 26 and October 3, 1859.)\r\n\r\nIn 1859, M. Hebert, an original observer of the highest authority,\r\ndeclared to the Geological Society of France that he had, in 1854, or\r\nfour years before Mr. Prestwich's visit to St. Acheul, seen the sections\r\nat Abbeville and Amiens, and had come to the opinion that the hatchets\r\nwere imbedded in the \"lower diluvium,\" and that their origin was as\r\nancient as that of the mammoth and the rhinoceros. M. Desnoyers also\r\nmade excavations after M. Gaudry, at St. Acheul, in 1859, with the same\r\nresults.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Bulletin\" volume 17 page 18.)\r\n\r\nAfter a lively discussion on the subject in England and France, it was\r\nremembered, not only that there were numerous recorded cases leading to\r\nsimilar conclusions in regard to cavern deposits, but, also, that Mr.\r\nFrere had, so long ago as 1797, found flint weapons, of the same type\r\nas those of Amiens, in a freshwater formation in Suffolk, in conjunction\r\nwith elephant remains; and nearly a hundred years earlier (1715),\r\nanother tool of the same kind had been exhumed from the gravel of\r\nLondon, together with bones of an elephant; to all which examples I\r\nshall allude more fully in the sequel.\r\n\r\nI may conclude this chapter by quoting a saying of Professor Agassiz,\r\n\"that whenever a new and startling fact is brought to light in science,\r\npeople first say, 'it is not true,' then that 'it is contrary to\r\nreligion,' and lastly, 'that everybody knew it before.'\"\r\n\r\nIf I were considering merely the cultivators of geology, I should say\r\nthat the doctrine of the former co-existence of Man with many extinct\r\nmammalia had already gone through these three phases in the progress\r\nof every scientific truth towards acceptance. But the grounds of this\r\nbelief have not yet been fully laid before the general public, so as\r\nto enable them fairly to weigh and appreciate the evidence. I shall\r\ntherefore do my best in the next three chapters to accomplish this task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. -- PEAT AND PLEISTOCENE ALLUVIUM OF THE VALLEY OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n     Geological Structure of the Valley of the Somme and of the\r\n        surrounding Country.\r\n     Position of Alluvium of different Ages.\r\n     Peat near Abbeville.\r\n     Its animal and vegetable Contents.\r\n     Works of Art in Peat.\r\n     Probable Antiquity of the Peat, and Changes of Level\r\n        since its Growth began.\r\n     Flint Implements of antique Type in older Alluvium.\r\n     Their various Forms and great Numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE SOMME VALLEY.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Somme in Picardy, alluded to in the last chapter, is\r\nsituated geologically in a region of white Chalk with flints, the strata\r\nof which are nearly horizontal. The Chalk hills which bound the valley\r\nare almost everywhere between 200 and 300 feet in height. On ascending\r\nto that elevation, we find ourselves on an extensive table-land, in\r\nwhich there are slight elevations and depressions. The white Chalk\r\nitself is scarcely ever exposed at the surface on this plateau, although\r\nseen on the slopes of the hills, as at b and c (Figure 7). The general\r\nsurface of the upland region is covered continuously for miles in every\r\ndirection by loam or brick-earth (Number 4), about 5 feet thick, devoid\r\nof fossils. To the wide extent of this loam the soil of Picardy chiefly\r\nowes its great fertility. Here and there we also observe, on the Chalk,\r\noutlying patches of Tertiary sand and clay (Number 5, Figure 7), with\r\nEocene fossils, the remnants of a formation once more extensive, and\r\nwhich probably once spread in one continuous mass over the Chalk,\r\nbefore the present system of valleys had begun to be shaped out. It is\r\nnecessary to allude to these relics of Tertiary strata, of which the\r\nlarger part is missing, because their denudation has contributed largely\r\nto furnish the materials of gravels in which the flint implements and\r\nbones of extinct mammalia are entombed. From this source have been\r\nderived not only the regular-formed egg-shaped pebbles, so common in\r\nthe old fluviatile alluvium at all levels, but those huge masses of\r\nhard sandstone, several feet in diameter, to which I shall allude in the\r\nsequel. The upland loam also (Number 4) has often, in no slight degree,\r\nbeen formed at the expense of the same Tertiary sands and clays, as is\r\nattested by its becoming more or less sandy or argillaceous, according\r\nto the nature of the nearest Eocene outlier in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe average width of the valley of the Somme between Amiens and\r\nAbbeville is one mile. The height, therefore, of the hills, in relation\r\nto the river-plain, could not be correctly represented in the annexed\r\ndiagram (Figure 7), as they would have to be reduced in altitude; or if\r\nnot, it would be necessary to make the space between c and b four times\r\nas great. The dimensions also of the masses, of drift or alluvium, 2\r\nand 3, have been exaggerated, in order to render them sufficiently\r\nconspicuous; for, all important as we shall find them to be as\r\ngeological monuments of the Pleistocene period, they form a truly\r\ninsignificant feature in the general structure of the country, so much\r\nso, that they might easily be overlooked in a cursory survey of the\r\ndistrict, and are usually unnoticed in geological maps not specially\r\ndevoted to the superficial formations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7. Valley of the Somme]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 7. SECTION ACROSS THE VALLEY OF THE SOMME IN PICARDY.\r\n\r\n  1. Peat, 20 to 30 feet thick, resting on gravel, a.\r\n  2. Lower level gravel with elephants' bones and flint tools,\r\n     covered with fluviatile loam, 20 to 40 feet thick.\r\n  3. Higher level gravel with similar fossils, and with overlying\r\n     loam, in all 30 feet thick.\r\n  4. Upland loam without shells (Limon des plateaux), 5 or 6\r\n     feet thick.\r\n  5. Eocene strata, resting on the Chalk in patches.)\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the description given of the section (Figure 7) that\r\nNumber 2 indicates the lower level gravels, and Number 3 the higher\r\nones, or those rising to elevations of 80 or 100 feet above the river.\r\nNewer than these is the peat Number 1, which is from 10 to 30 feet in\r\nthickness, and which is not only of later date than the alluvium, 2 and\r\n3, but is also posterior to the denudation of those gravels, or to the\r\ntime when the valley was excavated through them. Underneath the peat is\r\na bed of gravel, a, from 3 to 14 feet thick, which rests on undisturbed\r\nChalk. This gravel was probably formed, in part at least, when the\r\nvalley was scooped out to its present depth, since which time no\r\ngeological change has taken place, except the growth of the peat, and\r\ncertain oscillations in the general level of the country, to which we\r\nshall allude by and by. A thin layer of impervious clay separates the\r\ngravel a from the peat Number 1, and seems to have been a necessary\r\npreliminary to the growth of the peat.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAT OF THE VALLEY OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\nAs hitherto, in our retrospective survey, we have been obliged, for\r\nthe sake of proceeding from the known to the less known, to reverse the\r\nnatural order of history, and to treat of the newer before the older\r\nformations, I shall begin my account of the geological monuments of the\r\nvalley of the Somme by saying something of the most modern of all of\r\nthem, the peat. This substance occupies the lower parts of the valley\r\nfar above Amiens, and below Abbeville as far as the sea. It has already\r\nbeen stated to be in some places 30 feet thick, and is even occasionally\r\nmore than 30 feet, corresponding in that respect to the Danish mosses\r\nbefore described (Chapter 2). Like them, it belongs to the Recent\r\nperiod; all the embedded mammalia, as well as the shells, being of the\r\nsame species as those now inhabiting Europe. The bones of quadrupeds are\r\nvery numerous, as I can bear witness, having seen them brought up from\r\na considerable depth near Abbeville, almost as often as the dredging\r\ninstrument was used. Besides remains of the beaver, I was shown, in the\r\ncollection of M. Boucher de Perthes, two perfect lower jaws with teeth\r\nof the bear, Ursus arctos; and in the Paris Museum there is another\r\nspecimen, also from the Abbeville peat.\r\n\r\nThe list of mammalia already comprises a large proportion of those\r\nproper to the Swiss lake-dwellings, and to the shell-mounds and peat of\r\nDenmark; but unfortunately as yet no special study has been made of the\r\nFrench fauna, like that by which the Danish and Swiss zoologists and\r\nbotanists have enabled us to compare the wild and tame animals and the\r\nvegetation of the age of stone with that of the age of iron.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the abundance of mammalian bones in the peat, and the\r\nfrequency of stone implements of the Celtic and Gallo-Roman periods, M.\r\nBoucher de Perthes has only met with three or four fragments of human\r\nskeletons.\r\n\r\nAt some depth in certain places in the valley near Abbeville, the trunks\r\nof alders have been found standing erect as they grew, with their roots\r\nfixed in an ancient soil, afterwards covered with peat. Stems of the\r\nhazel, and nuts of the same, abound; trunks, also, of the oak and\r\nwalnut. The peat extends to the coast, and is there seen passing under\r\nthe sand-dunes and below the sea-level. At the mouth of the river\r\nCanche, which joins the sea near the embouchure of the Somme, yew trees,\r\nfirs, oaks, and hazels have been dug out of peat, which is there worked\r\nfor fuel, and is about three feet thick.*\r\n\r\n     (* D'Archiac, \"Histoire des Progres\" volume 2 page 154.)\r\n\r\nDuring great storms, large masses of compact peat, enclosing trunks of\r\nflattened trees, have been thrown up on the coast at the mouth of the\r\nSomme; seeming to indicate that there has been a subsidence of the land\r\nand a consequent submergence of what was once a westward continuation of\r\nthe valley of the Somme into what is now a part of the English Channel.\r\n\r\nWhether the vegetation of the lowest layers of peat differed as to the\r\ngeographical distribution of some of the trees from the middle, and this\r\nfrom the uppermost peat, as in Denmark, has not yet been ascertained;\r\nnor have careful observations been made with a view of calculating the\r\nminimum of time which the accumulation of so dense a mass of vegetable\r\nmatter must have taken. A foot in thickness of highly compressed peat,\r\nsuch as is sometimes reached in the bottom of the bogs, is obviously\r\nthe equivalent in time of a much greater thickness of peat of spongy\r\nand loose texture, found near the surface. The workmen who cut peat, or\r\ndredge it up from the bottom of swamps and ponds, declare that in the\r\ncourse of their lives none of the hollows which they have found, or\r\ncaused by extracting peat, have ever been refilled, even to a small\r\nextent. They deny, therefore, that the peat grows. This, as M. Boucher\r\nde Perthes observes, is a mistake; but it implies that the increase in\r\none generation is not very appreciable by the unscientific.\r\n\r\nThe antiquary finds near the surface Gallo-Roman remains, and still\r\ndeeper Celtic weapons of the stone period. [14] But the depth at which\r\nRoman works of art occur varies in different places, and is no sure test\r\nof age; because in some parts of the swamps, especially near the river,\r\nthe peat is often so fluid that heavy substances may sink through it,\r\ncarried down by their own gravity. In one case, however, M. Boucher de\r\nPerthes observed several large flat dishes of Roman pottery, lying in a\r\nhorizontal position in the peat, the shape of which must have prevented\r\nthem from sinking or penetrating through the underlying peat. Allowing\r\nabout fourteen centuries for the growth of the superincumbent vegetable\r\nmatter, he calculated that the thickness gained in a hundred years would\r\nbe no more than three centimetres.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Antiquites Celtiques\" volume 2 page 134.)\r\n\r\nThis rate of increase would demand so many thousands of years for the\r\nformation of the entire thickness of 30 feet that we must hesitate\r\nbefore adopting it as a chronometric scale. Yet, by multiplying\r\nobservations of this kind, and bringing one to bear upon and check\r\nanother, we may eventually succeed in obtaining data for estimating the\r\nage of the peaty deposit. [15]\r\n\r\nThe rate of increase in Denmark may not be applicable to France; because\r\ndifferences in the humidity of the climate, or in the intensity and\r\nduration of summer's heat and winter's cold, as well as diversity in the\r\nspecies of plants which most abound, would cause the peat to grow more\r\nor less rapidly, not only when we compare two distinct countries in\r\nEurope, but the same country at two successive periods.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to some facts which favour the idea that there\r\nhas been a change of level on the coast since the peat began to grow.\r\nThis conclusion seems confirmed by the mere thickness of peat at\r\nAbbeville, and the occurrence of alder and hazel-wood near the bottom of\r\nit. If 30 feet of peat were now removed, the sea would flow up and fill\r\nthe valley for miles above Abbeville. Yet this vegetable matter is all\r\nof supra-marine origin, for where shells occur in it they are all of\r\nterrestrial or fluviatile kinds, so that it must have grown above the\r\nsea-level when the land was more elevated than now. We have already\r\nseen what changes in the relative level of sea and land have occurred\r\nin Scotland subsequently to the time of the Romans, and are therefore\r\nprepared to meet with proofs of similar movements in Picardy. In that\r\ncountry they have probably not been confined simply to subsidence, but\r\nhave comprised oscillations in the level of the land, by which marine\r\nshells of the Pleistocene period have been raised some 10 feet or more\r\nabove the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nSmall as is the progress hitherto made in interpreting the pages of the\r\npeaty record, their importance in the valley of the Somme is enhanced by\r\nthe reflection that, whatever be the number of centuries to which they\r\nrelate, they belong to times posterior to the ancient implement-bearing\r\nbeds, which we are next to consider, and are even separated from them,\r\nas we shall see, by an interval far greater than that which divides the\r\nearliest strata of the peat from the latest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLINT IMPLEMENTS OF THE PLEISTOCENE PERIOD IN THE VALLEY OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\nThe alluvium of the valley of the Somme exhibits nothing extraordinary\r\nor exceptional in its position or external appearance, nor in the\r\narrangement or composition of its materials, nor in its organic remains;\r\nin all these characters it might be matched by the drift of a hundred\r\nother valleys in France or England. Its claim to our peculiar attention\r\nis derived from the wonderful number of flint tools, of a very antique\r\ntype, which, as stated in the last chapter, occur in undisturbed strata,\r\nassociated with the bones of extinct quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nAs much doubt has been cast on the question, whether the so-called\r\nflint hatchets have really been shaped by the hands of Man, it will be\r\ndesirable to begin by satisfying the reader's mind on that point, before\r\ninviting him to study the details of sections of successive beds of mud,\r\nsand, and gravel, which vary considerably even in contiguous localities.\r\n\r\nSince the spring of 1859, I have paid three visits to the Valley of the\r\nSomme, and examined all the principal localities of these flint tools.\r\nIn my excursions around Abbeville, I was accompanied by M. Boucher de\r\nPerthes, and during one of my explorations in the Amiens district,\r\nby Mr. Prestwitch. The first time I entered the pits at St. Acheul, I\r\nobtained seventy flint instruments, all of them collected from the drift\r\nin the course of the preceding five or six weeks. The two prevailing\r\nforms of these tools are represented in the annexed Figures 8 and 9,\r\neach of which are half the size of the originals; the first being the\r\nspear-headed form, varying in length from six to eight inches; the\r\nsecond, the oval form, which is not unlike some stone implements, used\r\nto this day as hatchets and tomahawks by natives of Australia, but with\r\nthis difference, that the edge in the Australian weapons (as in the case\r\nof those called celts in Europe) has been produced by friction, whereas\r\nthe cutting edge in the old tools of the valley of the Somme was always\r\ngained by the simple fracture of the flint, and by the repetition of\r\nmany dexterous blows.\r\n\r\nThe oval-shaped Australian weapons, however, differ in being sharpened\r\nat one end only. The other, though reduced by fracture to the same\r\ngeneral form, is left rough, in which state it is fixed into a cleft\r\nstick, which serves as a handle. To this it is firmly bound by thin\r\nstraps of opossum's hide. One of these tools, now in my possession, was\r\ngiven me by Mr. Farquharson of Haughton, who saw a native using it in\r\n1854 on the Auburn river, in Burnet district, North Australia.\r\n\r\nOut of more than a hundred flint implements which I obtained at St.\r\nAcheul, not a few had their edges more or less fractured or worn, either\r\nby use as instruments before they were buried in gravel, or by being\r\nrolled in the river's bed.\r\n\r\nSome of these tools were probably used as weapons, both of war and\r\nof the chase, others to grub up roots, cut down trees, and scoop out\r\ncanoes. Some of them may have served, as Mr. Prestwich has suggested,\r\nfor cutting holes in the ice both for fishing and for obtaining\r\nwater, as will be explained in the eighth chapter when we consider\r\nthe arguments in favour of the higher level drift having belonged to a\r\nperiod when the rivers were frozen over for several months every winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8. Flint Implement]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 8. FLINT IMPLEMENT FROM ST. ACHEUL, NEAR AMIENS,\r\n   OF THE SPEAR-HEAD SHAPE\r\n     (half the size of the original, which is 7 1/2 inches long).\r\n\r\n  a. Side view.\r\n  b. Same seen edgewise.\r\n\r\nThese spear-headed implements have been found in greater number,\r\nproportionally to the oval ones, in the upper level gravel at St.\r\nAcheul, than in any of the lower gravels in the valley of the Somme. In\r\nthese last the oval form predominates, especially at Abbeville.)\r\n\r\nWhen the natural form of a Chalk-flint presented a suitable handle at\r\none end, as in the specimen, Figure 10, that part was left as found. The\r\nportion, for example, between b and c has probably not been altered; the\r\nprotuberances which are fractured having been broken off by river action\r\nbefore the flint was chipped artificially. The other extremity, a, has\r\nbeen worked till it acquired a proper shape and cutting edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figures 9 and 10. Flint Implements]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURES 9 AND 10.

The\r\n  entire surface of Number 9 must have been black when first shaped,\r\n  and the bleaching to such a depth must have been the work of time,\r\n  whether produced by exposure to the sun and air before it was\r\n  embedded, or afterwards when it lay deep in the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 10.

Dendrites on Fling Hatchets]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURES 11, 12 AND 13. DENDRITES ON SURFACES OF FLINT HATCHETS IN\r\n  THE DRIFT OF ST. ACHEUL, NEAR AMIENS.\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 11. a. Natural size.\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 12. b. Natural size. c. Magnified.\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 13. d. Natural size.\r\n     e. Magnified.)\r\n\r\nThe surface of many of the tools is encrusted with a film of carbonate\r\nof lime, while others are adorned by those ramifying crystallisations\r\ncalled dendrites (see Figures 11, 12 and 13), usually consisting of the\r\nmixed oxides of iron and manganese, forming extremely delicate blackish\r\nbrown sprigs, resembling the smaller kinds of sea weed. They are a\r\nuseful test of antiquity when suspicions are entertained of the workmen\r\nhaving forged the hatchets which they offer for sale. The most general\r\ntest, however, of the genuineness of the implements obtained by purchase\r\nis their superficial varnish-like or vitreous gloss, as contrasted with\r\nthe dull aspect of freshly fractured flints. I also remarked, during\r\neach of my three visits to Amiens, that there were some extensive\r\ngravel-pits, such as those of Montiers and St. Roch, agreeing in their\r\ngeological character with those of St. Acheul, and only a mile or\r\ntwo distant, where the workmen, although familiar with the forms, and\r\nknowing the marketable value of the articles above described, assured me\r\nthat they had never been able to find a single implement.\r\n\r\nRespecting the authenticity of the tools as works of art, Professor\r\nRamsay, than whom no one could be a more competent judge, observes: \"For\r\nmore than twenty years, like others of my craft, I have daily handled\r\nstones, whether fashioned by nature or art; and the flint hatchets of\r\nAmiens and Abbeville seem to me as clearly works of art as any Sheffield\r\nwhittle.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Athenaeum\" July 16, 1859.)\r\n\r\nMr. Evans classifies the implements under three heads, two of which,\r\nthe spear heads and the oval or almond-shaped kinds, have already been\r\ndescribed. The third form (Figure 14) consists of flakes, apparently\r\nintended for knives or some of the smaller ones for arrow heads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14. Flint Knife or Flake]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 14. FLINT KNIFE OR FLAKE FROM BELOW THE SAND CONTAINING\r\n  CYRENA FLUMINALIS. MENCHECOURT, ABBEVILLE.\r\n   d. Transverse section along the line of fracture, b, c.\r\n   Size, two-thirds of the original.)\r\n\r\nIn regard to their origin, Mr. Evans observes that there is a uniformity\r\nof shape, a correctness of outline, and a sharpness about the cutting\r\nedges and points, which cannot be due to anything but design.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Archaeologia\" volume 38.)\r\n\r\nOf these knives and flakes, I obtained several specimens from a pit\r\nwhich I caused to be dug at Abbeville, in sand in contact with the\r\nChalk, and below certain fluvio-marine beds, which will be alluded to in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\nBetween the spear-head and oval shapes, there are various intermediate\r\ngradations, and there are also a vast variety of very rude implements,\r\nmany of which may have been rejected as failures, and others struck off\r\nas chips in the course of manufacturing the more perfect ones. Some\r\nof these chips can only be recognised by an experienced eye as bearing\r\nmarks of human workmanship.\r\n\r\nIt has often been asked, how, without the use of metallic hammers, so\r\nmany of these oval and spear-headed tools could have been wrought into\r\nso uniform a shape. Mr. Evans, in order experimentally to illustrate the\r\nprocess, constructed a stone hammer, by mounting a pebble in a wooden\r\nhandle, and with this tool struck off flakes from the edge on both sides\r\nof a Chalk flint, till it acquired precisely the same shape as the oval\r\ntool, Figure 9.\r\n\r\nIf I were invited to estimate the probable number of the more perfect\r\ntools found in the valley of the Somme since 1842, rejecting all the\r\nknives, and all that might be suspected of being spurious or forged, I\r\nshould conjecture that they far exceeded a thousand. Yet it would be\r\na great mistake to imagine that an antiquary or geologist, who should\r\ndevote a few weeks to the exploration of such a valley as that of the\r\nSomme, would himself be able to detect a single specimen. But few tools\r\nwere lying on the surface. The rest have been exposed to view by the\r\nremoval of such a volume of sand, clay, and gravel, that the price of\r\nthe discovery of one of them could only be estimated by knowing how many\r\nhundred labourers have toiled at the fortifications of Abbeville, or\r\nin the sand and gravel pits near that city, and around Amiens, for road\r\nmaterials and other economic purposes, during the last twenty years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15. Fossils of the White Chalk]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 15. FOSSILS OF THE WHITE CHALK.\r\n\r\n  a, b. Coscinopora globularis, D'Orbigny. Orbitolina concava,\r\n  Parker and Jones. c. Part of same magnified.)\r\n\r\nIn the gravel pits of St. Acheul, and in some others near Amiens, small\r\nround bodies, having a tubular cavity in the centre, occur. They are\r\nwell known as fossils of the White Chalk. Dr. Rigollot suggested that\r\nthey might have been strung together as beads, and he supposed the hole\r\nin the middle to have been artificial. Some of these round bodies are\r\nfound entire in the Chalk and in the gravel, others have naturally a\r\nhole passing through them, and sometimes one or two holes penetrating\r\nsome way in from the surface, but not extending to the other side.\r\nOthers, like b, Figure 15, have a large cavity, which has a very\r\nartificial aspect. It is impossible to decide whether they have or have\r\nnot served as personal ornaments, recommended by their globular form,\r\nlightness, and by being less destructible than ordinary Chalk. Granting\r\nthat there were natural cavities in the axis of some of them, it does\r\nnot follow that these may not have been taken advantage of for stringing\r\nthem as beads, while others may have been artificially bored through.\r\nDr. Rigollot's argument in favour of their having been used as necklaces\r\nor bracelets, appears to me a sound one. He says he often found small\r\nheaps or groups of them in one place, all perforated, just as if, when\r\nswept into the river's bed by a flood, the bond which had united them\r\ntogether remained unbroken.*\r\n\r\n     (* Rigollot, \"Memoire sur des Instruments en Silex\" etc.,\r\n     Amiens 1854 page 16.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. -- PLEISTOCENE ALLUVIUM WITH FLINT IMPLEMENTS OF THE VALLEY\r\nOF THE SOMME--CONCLUDED.\r\n\r\n   Fluvio-marine Strata, with Flint Implements, near Abbeville.\r\n   Marine Shells in same.\r\n   Cyrena fluminalis.\r\n   Mammalia.\r\n   Entire Skeleton of Rhinoceros.\r\n   Flint Implements, why found low down in Fluviatile Deposits.\r\n   Rivers shifting their Channels.\r\n   Relative Ages of higher and lower-level Gravels.\r\n   Section of Alluvium of St. Acheul.\r\n   Two Species of Elephant and Hippopotamus coexisting with Man\r\n      in France.\r\n   Volume of Drift, proving Antiquity of Flint Implements.\r\n   Absence of Human Bones in tool-bearing Alluvium, how explained.\r\n   Value of certain Kinds of negative Evidence tested thereby.\r\n   Human Bones not found in drained Lake of Haarlem.\r\n\r\nIn the section of the valley of the Somme given in Figure 7, the\r\nsuccessive formations newer than the Chalk are numbered in chronological\r\norder, beginning with the most modern, or the peat, which is marked\r\nNumber 1, and which has been treated of in the last chapter. Next in the\r\norder of antiquity are the lower-level gravels, Number 2, which we have\r\nnow to describe; after which the alluvium, Number 3, found at higher\r\nlevels, or about 80 and 100 feet above the river-plain, will remain to\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\nI have selected, as illustrating the old alluvium of the Somme occurring\r\nat levels slightly elevated above the present river, the sand and\r\ngravel-pits of Menchecourt, in the northwest suburbs of Abbeville, to\r\nwhich, as before stated, attention was first drawn by M. Boucher de\r\nPerthes, in his work on Celtic antiquities. Here, although in every\r\nadjoining pit some minor variations in the nature and thickness of the\r\nsuperimposed deposits may be seen, there is yet a general approach to\r\nuniformity in the series. The only stratum of which the relative age\r\nis somewhat doubtful, is the gravel marked a, underlying the peat, and\r\nresting on the Chalk. It is only known by borings, and some of it may be\r\nof the same age as Number 3; but I believe it to be for the most part\r\nof more modern origin, consisting of the wreck of all the older gravel,\r\nincluding Number 3, and formed during the last hollowing out and\r\ndeepening of the valley immediately before the commencement of the\r\ngrowth of peat.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of flint implements have been dug out of Number 3,\r\noften near the bottom, and twenty-five, thirty, or even more than thirty\r\nfeet below the surface of Number 1.\r\n\r\nA geologist will perceive by a glance at the section that the valley of\r\nthe Somme must have been excavated nearly to its present depth and\r\nwidth when the strata of Number 3 were thrown down, and that after the\r\ndeposits Numbers 3, 2, and 1 had been formed in succession, the present\r\nvalley was scooped out, patches only of Numbers 3 and 2 being left. For\r\nthese deposits cannot originally have ended abruptly as they now do, but\r\nmust have once been continuous farther towards the centre of the valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16. Fluvio-Marine Strata]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 16.

Brown clay with angular flints, and occasionally Chalk rubble,\r\n     unstratified, following the slope of the hill, probably of\r\n     subaerial origin, of very varying thickness, from 2 to 5 feet\r\n     and upwards.\r\n  2. Calcareous loam, buff-coloured, resembling loess, for the most\r\n     part unstratified, in some places with slight traces of\r\n     stratification, containing freshwater and land shells, with\r\n     bones of elephants, etc.; thickness about 15 feet.\r\n  3. Alternations of beds of gravel, marl, and sand, with\r\n     freshwater and land shells, and, in some of the lower sands,\r\n     a mixture of marine shells; also bones of elephant, rhinoceros,\r\n     etc., and flint implements; thickness about 12 feet.\r\n  a. Gravel underlying peat, age undetermined.\r\n  b. Layer of impervious clay, separating the gravel from the peat.)\r\n\r\nTo begin with the oldest, Number 3, it is made up of a succession of\r\nbeds, chiefly of freshwater origin, but occasionally a mixture of marine\r\nand fluviatile shells is observed in it, proving that the sea sometimes\r\ngained upon the river, whether at high tides or when the fresh water was\r\nless in quantity during the dry season, and sometimes perhaps when the\r\nland was slightly depressed in level. All these accidents might occur\r\nagain and again at the mouth of any river, and give rise to alternations\r\nof fluviatile and marine strata, such as are seen at Menchecourt.\r\n\r\nIn the lowest beds of gravel and sand in contact with the Chalk, flint\r\nhatchets, some perfect, others much rolled, have been found; and in a\r\nsandy bed in this position some workmen, whom I employed to sink a pit,\r\nfound four flint knives. Above this sand and gravel occur beds of white\r\nand siliceous sand, containing shells of the genera Planorbis, Limnea,\r\nPaludina, Valvata, Cyclas, Cyrena, Helix, and others, all now natives of\r\nthe same part of France, except Cyrena fluminalis (Figure 17), which no\r\nlonger lives in Europe, but inhabits the Nile, and many parts of Asia,\r\nincluding Cashmere, where it abounds. No species of Cyrena is now met\r\nwith in a living state in Europe. Mr. Prestwich first observed it fossil\r\nat Menchecourt, and it has since been found in two or three contiguous\r\nsand-pits, always in the fluvio-marine bed. [16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.

Several of these I have myself collected\r\nentire, though in a state of great decomposition, lying in the white\r\nsand called \"sable aigre\" by the workmen. They are all littoral species\r\nnow proper to the contiguous coast of France. Their occurrence in a\r\nfossil state associated with freshwater shells at Menchecourt had been\r\nnoticed as long ago as 1836 by MM. Ravin and Baillon, before M. Boucher\r\nde Perthes commenced the researches which have since made the locality\r\nso celebrated.*\r\n\r\n     (* D'Archiac, \"Histoire des Progres\" etc. volume 2 page\r\n     154.)\r\n\r\nThe numbers since collected preclude all idea of their having been\r\nbrought inland as eatable shells by the fabricators of the flint\r\nhatchets found at the bottom of the fluvio-marine sands. From the same\r\nbeds, and in marls alternating with the sands, remains of the elephant,\r\nrhinoceros, and other mammalia have been exhumed.\r\n\r\nAbove the fluvio-marine strata are those designated Number 2 in the\r\nsection (Figure 16), which are almost devoid of stratification, and\r\nprobably formed of mud or sediment thrown down by the waters of the\r\nriver when they overflowed the ancient alluvial plain of that day. Some\r\nland shells, a few river shells, and bones of mammalia, some of them\r\nextinct, occur in Number 2. Its upper surface has been deeply furrowed\r\nand cut into by the action of water, at the time when the earthy matter\r\nof Number 1 was superimposed. The materials of this uppermost deposit\r\nare arranged as if they had been the result of land floods, taking place\r\nafter the formations 2 and 3 had been raised, or had become exposed to\r\ndenudation.\r\n\r\nThe fluvio-marine strata and overlying loam of Menchecourt recur on the\r\nopposite or left bank of the alluvial plain of the Somme, at a distance\r\nof 2 or 3 miles. They are found at Mautort, among other places, and I\r\nobtained there the flint hatchet shown in Figure 9, of an oval form. It\r\nwas extracted from gravel, above which were strata containing a mixture\r\nof marine and freshwater shells, precisely like those of Menchecourt.\r\nIn the alluvium of all parts of the valley, both at high and low levels,\r\nrolled bones are sometimes met with in the gravel. Some of the flint\r\ntools in the gravel of Abbeville have their angles very perfect, others\r\nhave been much triturated, as if in the bed of the main river or some of\r\nits tributaries.\r\n\r\nThe mammalia most frequently cited as having been found in the deposits\r\nNumbers 2 and 3 at Menchecourt, are the following:--\r\n\r\n     Elephas primigenius.\r\n     Rhinoceros tichorhinus.\r\n     Equus fossilis, Owen.\r\n     Bos primigenius.\r\n     Cervus somonensis, Cuvier.\r\n     C. tarandus priscus, Cuvier.\r\n     Felis spelaea.\r\n     Hyaena spelaea.\r\n\r\nThe Ursus spelaeus has also been mentioned by some writers; but\r\nM. Lartet says he has sought in vain for it among the osteological\r\ntreasures sent from Abbeville to Cuvier at Paris, and in other\r\ncollections. The same palaeontologist, after a close scrutiny of the\r\nbones sent formerly to the Paris Museum from the valley of the Somme,\r\nobserved that some of them bore the evident marks of an instrument,\r\nagreeing well with incisions such as a rude flint-saw would produce.\r\nAmong other bones mentioned as having been thus artificially cut,\r\nare those of a Rhinoceros tichorhinus, and the antlers of Cervus\r\nsomonensis.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 16\r\n     1860 page 471.)\r\n\r\nThe evidence obtained by naturalists that some of the extinct mammalia\r\nof Menchecourt really lived and died in this part of France, at the\r\ntime of the embedding of the flint tools in fluviatile strata, is most\r\nsatisfactory; and not the less so for having been put on record long\r\nbefore any suspicion was entertained that works of art would ever be\r\ndetected in the same beds. Thus M. Baillon, writing in 1834 to M. Ravin,\r\nsays: \"They begin to meet with fossil bones at the depth of 10 or 12\r\nfeet in the Menchecourt sand-pits, but they find a much greater quantity\r\nat the depth of 18 and 20 feet. Some of them were evidently broken\r\nbefore they were embedded, others are rounded, having, without doubt,\r\nbeen rolled by running water. It is at the bottom of the sand-pits that\r\nthe most entire bones occur. Here they lie without having undergone\r\nfracture or friction, and seem to have been articulated together at the\r\ntime when they were covered up. I found in one place a whole hind limb\r\nof a rhinoceros, the bones of which were still in their true relative\r\nposition. They must have been joined together by ligaments, and even\r\nsurrounded by muscles at the time of their interment. The entire\r\nskeleton of the same species was lying at a short distance from the\r\nspot.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Societe Roy. d'Emulation d'Abbeville\" 1834 page 197.)\r\n\r\nIf we suppose that the greater number of the flint implements occurring\r\nin the neighbourhood of Abbeville and Amiens were brought by river\r\naction into their present position, we can at once explain why so large\r\na proportion of them are found at considerable depths from the surface,\r\nfor they would naturally be buried in gravel and not in fine sediment,\r\nor what may be termed \"inundation mud,\" such as Number 2 (Figure 16),\r\na deposit from tranquil water, or where the stream had not sufficient\r\nforce or velocity to sweep along Chalk flints, whether wrought or\r\nunwrought. Hence we have almost always to pass down through a mass of\r\nincumbent loam with land shells, or through fine sand with freshwater\r\nmolluscs, before we get into the beds of gravel containing hatchets.\r\nOccasionally a weapon used as a projectile may have fallen into quiet\r\nwater, or may have dropped from a canoe to the bottom of the river, or\r\nmay have been floated by ice, as are some stones occasionally by the\r\nThames in severe winters, and carried over the meadows bordering its\r\nbanks; but such cases are exceptional, though helping to explain how\r\nisolated flint tools or pebbles and angular stones are now and then to\r\nbe seen in the midst of the finest loams.\r\n\r\nThe endless variety in the sections of the alluvium of the valley of the\r\nSomme, may be ascribed to the frequent silting up of the main stream and\r\nits tributaries during different stages of the excavation of the valley,\r\nprobably also during changes in the level of the land. As a rule, when a\r\nriver attacks and undermines one bank, it throws down gravel and sand on\r\nthe opposite side of its channel, which is growing somewhere shallower,\r\nand is soon destined to be raised so high as to form an addition to\r\nthe alluvial plain, and to be only occasionally inundated. In this way,\r\nafter much encroachment on cliff or meadow at certain points, we find\r\nat the end of centuries that the width of the channel has not been\r\nenlarged, for the new made ground is raised after a time to the average\r\nheight of the older alluvial tract. Sometimes an island is formed in\r\nmidstream, the current flowing for a while on both sides of it, and\r\nat length scooping out a deeper channel on one side so as to leave the\r\nother to be gradually filled up during freshets and afterwards elevated\r\nby inundation mud, or \"brick-earth.\" During the levelling up of these\r\nold channels, a flood sometimes cuts into and partially removes portions\r\nof the previously stratified matter, causing those repeated signs of\r\nfurrowing and filling up of cavities, those memorials of doing and\r\nundoing, of which the tool-bearing sands and gravels of Abbeville and\r\nAmiens afford such reiterated illustrations, and of which a parallel is\r\nfurnished by the ancient alluvium of the Thames valley, where similar\r\nbones of extinct mammalia and shells, including Cyrena fluminalis, are\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nProfessor Noeggerath, of Bonn, informs me that, about the year 1845,\r\nwhen the bed of the Rhine was deepened artificially by the blasting\r\nand removal of rock in the narrows at Bingerloch, not far from Bingen,\r\nseveral flint hatchets and an extraordinary number of iron weapons of\r\nthe Roman period were brought up by the dredge from the bed of the great\r\nriver. The decomposition of the iron had caused much of the gravel to\r\nbe cemented together into a conglomerate. In such a case we have only\r\nto suppose the Rhine to deviate slightly from its course, changing\r\nits position, as it has often done in various parts of its plain in\r\nhistorical times, and then tools of the stone and iron periods would\r\nbe found in gravel at the bottom with a great thickness of sand and\r\noverlying loam deposited above them.\r\n\r\nChanges in a river plain, such as those above alluded to, give rise\r\nfrequently to ponds, swamps, and marshes, marking the course of old beds\r\nor branches of the river not yet filled up, and in these depressions\r\nshells proper both to running and stagnant water may be preserved, and\r\nquadrupeds may be mired. The latest and uppermost deposit of the series\r\nwill be loam or brick-earth, with land and amphibious shells (Helix and\r\nSuccinea), while below will follow strata containing freshwater shells,\r\nimplying continuous submergence; and lowest of all in most sections will\r\nbe the coarse gravel accumulated by a current of considerable strength\r\nand velocity.\r\n\r\nWhen the St. Katharine docks were excavated at London, and similar works\r\nexecuted on the banks of the Mersey, old ships were dug out, as I have\r\nelsewhere noticed,* showing how the Thames and Mersey have in modern\r\ntimes been shifting their channels.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles of Geology\" 10th edition volume 2 page 547.)\r\n\r\nRecently, an old silted-up bed of the Thames has been discovered by\r\nboring at Shoeburyness at the mouth of the river opposite Sheerness, as\r\nI learn from Mr. Mylne. The old deserted branch is separated from the\r\nnew or present channel of the Thames, by a mass of London Clay which\r\nhas escaped denudation. The depth of the old branch, or the thickness\r\nof fluviatile strata with which it has been filled up, is 75 feet. The\r\nactual channel in the neighbourhood is now 60 feet deep, but there is\r\nprobably 10 or 15 feet of stratified sand and gravel at the bottom; so\r\nthat, should the river deviate again from its course, its present bed\r\nmight be the receptacle of a fluvio-marine formation 75 feet thick,\r\nequal to the former one of Shoeburyness, and more considerable than that\r\nof Abbeville. It would consist both of freshwater and marine strata,\r\nas the salt water is carried by the tide far up above Sheerness; but in\r\norder that such deposits should resemble, in geological position, the\r\nMenchecourt beds, they must be raised 10 or 15 feet above their present\r\nlevel, and be partially eroded. Such erosion they would not fail to\r\nsuffer during the process of upheaval, because the Thames would scour\r\nout its bed, and not alter its position relatively to the sea, while the\r\nland was gradually rising.\r\n\r\nBefore the canal was made at Abbeville, the tide was perceptible in\r\nthe Somme for some distance above that city. It would only require,\r\ntherefore, a slight subsidence to allow the salt water to reach\r\nMenchecourt, as it did in the Pleistocene period. As a stratum\r\ncontaining exclusively land and freshwater shells usually underlies\r\nthe fluvio-marine sands at Menchecourt, it seems that the river first\r\nprevailed there, after which the land subsided; and then there was an\r\nupheaval which raised the country to a greater height than that at which\r\nit now stands, after which there was a second sinking, indicated by the\r\nposition of the peat, as already explained. All these changes happened\r\nsince Man first inhabited this region.\r\n\r\nAt several places in the environs of Abbeville there are fluviatile\r\ndeposits at a higher level by 50 feet than the uppermost beds at\r\nMenchecourt, resting in like manner on the Chalk. One of these occurs in\r\nthe suburbs of the city at Moulin Quignon, 100 feet above the Somme\r\nand on the same side of the valley as Menchecourt, and containing flint\r\nimplements of the same antique type and the bones of elephants; but no\r\nmarine shells have been found there, nor in any gravel or sand at higher\r\nelevations than the Menchecourt marine shells.\r\n\r\nIt has been a matter of discussion among geologists whether the higher\r\nor the lower sands and gravels of the Somme valley are the more ancient.\r\nAs a general rule, when there are alluvial formations of different ages\r\nin the same valley, those which occupy a more elevated position above\r\nthe river plain are the oldest. In Auvergne and Velay, in Central\r\nFrance, where the bones of fossil quadrupeds occur at all heights above\r\nthe present rivers from 10 to 1000 feet, we observe the terrestrial\r\nfauna to depart in character from that now living in proportion as\r\nwe ascend to higher terraces and platforms. We pass from the lower\r\nalluvium, containing the mammoth, tichorhine rhinoceros, and reindeer,\r\nto various older groups of fossils, till, on a tableland 1000 feet high\r\n(near Le Puy, for example), the abrupt termination of which overlooks\r\nthe present valley, we discover an old extinct river-bed covered by\r\na current of ancient lava, showing where the lowest level was once\r\nsituated. In that elevated alluvium the remains of a Tertiary mastodon\r\nand other quadrupeds of like antiquity are embedded.\r\n\r\nIf the Menchecourt beds had been first formed, and the valley, after\r\nbeing nearly as deep and wide as it is now, had subsided, the sea\r\nmust have advanced inland, causing small delta-like accumulations at\r\nsuccessive heights, wherever the main river and its tributaries met\r\nthe sea. Such a movement, especially if it were intermittent, and\r\ninterrupted occasionally by long pauses, would very well account for the\r\naccumulation of stratified debris which we encounter at certain points\r\nin the valley, especially around Abbeville and Amiens. But we are\r\nprecluded from adopting this theory by the entire absence of marine\r\nshells, and the presence of freshwater and land species, and mammalian\r\nbones, in considerable abundance, in the drift both of higher and lower\r\nlevels above Abbeville. Had there been a total absence of all organic\r\nremains, we might have imagined the former presence of the sea, and the\r\ndestruction of such remains might have been ascribed to carbonic acid\r\nor other decomposing causes; but the Pleistocene and implement-bearing\r\nstrata can be shown by their fossils to be of fluviatile origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLINT IMPLEMENTS IN GRAVEL NEAR AMIENS. GRAVEL OF ST. ACHEUL.\r\n\r\nWhen we ascend the valley of the Somme, from Abbeville to Amiens, a\r\ndistance of about 25 miles, we observe a repetition of all the same\r\nalluvial phenomena which we have seen exhibited at Menchecourt and its\r\nneighbourhood, with the single exception of the absence of marine shells\r\nand of Cyrena fluminalis. We find lower-level gravel, such as Number 2,\r\nFigure 7, and higher-level alluvium, such as Number 3, the latter rising\r\nto 100 feet above the plain, which at Amiens is about 50 feet above the\r\nlevel of the river at Abbeville. In both the upper and lower gravels,\r\nas Dr. Rigollot stated in 1854, flint tools and the bones of extinct\r\nanimals, together with river shells and land shells of living species,\r\nabound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figures 18, 19 and 20. Elephas]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 18.* Elephas primigenius.\r\n     Penultimate molar, lower jaw, right side, one-third of\r\n     natural size, Pleistocene.

Lartet, and Figure 18\r\n     will be found in his paper in \"Bulletin de la Societe\r\n     Geologique de France\" March 1859. Figure 19 is from Falconer\r\n     and Cautley \"Fauna Sivalensis.\")\r\n\r\nImmediately below Amiens, a great mass of stratified gravel, slightly\r\nelevated above the alluvial plain of the Somme, is seen at St. Roch,\r\nand half a mile farther down the valley at Montiers. Between these two\r\nplaces a small tributary stream, called the Celle, joins the Somme. In\r\nthe gravel at Montiers, Mr. Prestwich and I found some flint knives, one\r\nof them flat on one side, but the other carefully worked, and exhibiting\r\nmany fractures, clearly produced by blows skilfully applied. Some of\r\nthese knives were taken from so low a level as to satisfy us that this\r\ngreat bed of gravel at Montiers, as well as that of the contiguous\r\nquarries of St. Roch, which seems to be a continuation of the same\r\ndeposit, may be referred to the human period. Dr. Rigollot had already\r\nmentioned flint hatchets as obtained by him from St. Roch, but as\r\nnone have been found there of late years, his statement was thought to\r\nrequire confirmation. The discovery, therefore, of these flint knives\r\nin gravel of the same age was interesting, especially as many tusks of\r\na hippopotamus have been obtained from the gravel of St. Roch--some of\r\nthese recently by Mr. Prestwich; while M. Garnier of Amiens has procured\r\na fine elephant's molar from the same pits, which Dr. Falconer refers to\r\nElephas antiquus, see Figure 19. Hence I infer that both these animals\r\nco-existed with Man.\r\n\r\nThe alluvial formations of Montiers are very instructive in another\r\npoint of view. If, leaving the lower gravel of that place, which is\r\ntopped with loam or brick-earth (of which the upper portion is about\r\n30 feet above the level of the Somme), we ascend the Chalk slope to\r\nthe height of about 80 feet, another deposit of gravel and sand, with\r\nfluviatile shells in a perfect condition, occurs, indicating most\r\nclearly an ancient river-bed, the waters of which ran habitually at\r\nthat higher level before the valley had been scooped out to its present\r\ndepth. This superior deposit is on the same side of the Somme, and about\r\nas high, as the lowest part of the celebrated formation of St. Acheul, 2\r\nor 3 miles distant, to which I shall now allude.\r\n\r\nThe terrace of St. Acheul may be described as a gently sloping ledge of\r\nChalk, covered with gravel, topped as usual with loam or fine sediment,\r\nthe surface of the loam being 100 feet above the Somme, and about 150\r\nabove the sea.\r\n\r\nMany stone coffins of the Gallo-Roman period have been dug out of the\r\nupper portion of this alluvial mass. The trenches made for burying\r\nthem sometimes penetrate to the depth of 8 or 9 feet from the surface,\r\nentering the upper part of Number 3 of the sections Figures 21 and 22.\r\nThey prove that when the Romans were in Gaul they found this terrace in\r\nthe same condition as it is now, or rather as it was before the removal\r\nof so much gravel, sand, clay, and loam, for repairing roads, and for\r\nmaking bricks and pottery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21. Section of Gravel Pit]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 21. SECTION OF GRAVEL PIT CONTAINING FLINT IMPLEMENTS\r\n   AT ST. ACHEUL, NEAR AMIENS, OBSERVED IN JULY 1860.\r\n\r\n  1.

Entire molar of Elephas primigenius, 17 feet from the surface.\r\n  c. Position of flint hatchet, 18 feet from the surface.)\r\n\r\nIn the annexed section (Figure 21), which I observed during my last\r\nvisit in 1860, it will be seen that a fragment of an elephant's tooth is\r\nnoticed as having been dug out of unstratified sandy loam at the point\r\na, 11 feet from the surface. This was found at the time of my visit; and\r\nat a lower point, at b, 18 feet from the surface, a large nearly entire\r\nand unrolled molar of the same species was obtained, which is now in my\r\npossession. It has been pronounced by Dr. Falconer to belong to Elephas\r\nprimigenius.\r\n\r\nA stone hatchet of an oval form, like that represented at Figure 9, was\r\ndiscovered at the same time, about one foot lower down, at c, in densely\r\ncompressed gravel. The surface of the fundamental Chalk is uneven\r\nin this pit, and slopes towards the valley-plain of the Somme. In a\r\nhorizontal distance of 20 feet, I found a difference in vertical height\r\nof 7 feet. In the chalky sand, sometimes occurring in interstices\r\nbetween the separate fragments of flint, constituting the coarse gravel\r\nNumber 4, entire as well as broken freshwater shells are often met with.\r\nTo some it may appear enigmatical how such fragile objects could have\r\nescaped annihilation in a river-bed, when flint tools and much gravel\r\nwere shoved along the bottom; but I have seen the dredging instrument\r\nemployed in the Thames, above and below London Bridge, to deepen the\r\nriver, and worked by steam power, scoop up gravel and sand from the\r\nbottom, and then pour the contents pell-mell into the boat, and still\r\nmany specimens of Limnaea, Planorbis, Paludina, Cyclas, and other shells\r\nmight be taken out uninjured from the gravel.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the gravel Number 4 is obliquely stratified,\r\nand that its surface had undergone denudation before the white sandy\r\nloam Number 3 was superimposed. The materials of the gravel at d must\r\nhave been cemented or frozen together into a somewhat coherent mass\r\nto allow the projecting ridge, d, to stand up 5 feet above the general\r\nsurface, the sides being in some places perpendicular. In Number 3 we\r\nprobably behold an example of a passage from river-silt to inundation\r\nmud. In some parts of it, land shells occur.\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained by MM. Buteux, Ravin, and other observers\r\nconversant with the geology of this part of France, that in none of the\r\nalluvial deposits, ancient or modern, are there any fragments of rocks\r\nforeign to the basin of the Somme--no erratics which could only be\r\nexplained by supposing them to have been brought by ice, during a\r\ngeneral submergence of the country, from some other hydrographical\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\nBut in some of the pits at St. Acheul there are seen in the beds Number\r\n4, Figure 21, not only well-rounded Tertiary pebbles, but great\r\nblocks of hard sandstone, of the kind called in the south of England\r\n\"greywethers,\" some of which are 3 or 4 feet and upwards in diameter.\r\nThey are usually angular, and when spherical owe their shape generally\r\nto an original concretionary structure, and not to trituration in a\r\nriver's bed. These large fragments of stone abound both in the higher\r\nand lower level gravels round Amiens and at the higher level at\r\nAbbeville. They have also been traced far up the valley above Amiens,\r\nwherever patches of the old alluvium occur. They have all been derived\r\nfrom the Tertiary strata which once covered the Chalk. Their dimensions\r\nare such that it is impossible to imagine a river like the present\r\nSomme, flowing through a flat country, with a gentle fall towards\r\nthe sea, to have carried them for miles down its channel unless ice\r\nco-operated as a transporting power. Their angularity also favours the\r\nsupposition of their having been floated by ice, or rendered so\r\nbuoyant by it as to have escaped much of the wear and tear which blocks\r\npropelled along the bottom of a river channel would otherwise suffer.\r\nWe must remember that the present mildness of the winters in Picardy\r\nand the northwest of Europe generally is exceptional in the northern\r\nhemisphere, and that large fragments of granite, sandstone, and\r\nlimestone are now carried annually by ice down the Canadian rivers in\r\nlatitudes farther south than Paris.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles of Geology\" 9th edition page 220.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22. Contorted Strata]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 22. CONTORTED FLUVIATILE STRATA AT ST. ACHEUL\r\n   (Prestwich, \"Philosophical Transactions\" 1861, page 299).\r\n\r\n  1. Surface soil.\r\n  2.

Beds of gravel with sharp curves.)\r\n\r\nAnother sign of ice agency, of which Mr. Prestwich has given a good\r\nillustration in one of his published sections, and which I myself\r\nobserved in several pits at St. Acheul, deserves notice. It consists\r\nin flexures and contortions of the strata of sand, marl, and gravel (as\r\nseen at b, c, and d, Figure 22), which they have evidently undergone\r\nsince their original deposition, and from which both the underlying\r\nChalk and part of the overlying beds of sand Number 3 are usually\r\nexempt.\r\n\r\nIn my former writings I have attributed this kind of derangement to two\r\ncauses; first, the pressure of ice running aground on yielding banks of\r\nmud and sand; and, secondly, the melting of masses of ice and snow of\r\nunequal thickness, on which horizontal layers of mud, sand, and other\r\nfine and coarse materials had accumulated. The late Mr. Trimmer first\r\npointed out in what manner the unequal failure of support caused by the\r\nliquefaction of underlying or intercalated snow and ice might give rise\r\nto such complicated foldings.*\r\n\r\n     (* See chapter 12.)\r\n\r\nWhen \"ice-jams\" occur on the St. Lawrence and other Canadian rivers\r\n(latitude 46 degrees north), the sheets of ice, which become packed or\r\nforced under or over one another, assume in most cases a highly inclined\r\nand sometimes even a vertical position. They are often observed to be\r\ncoated on one side with mud, sand, or gravel frozen on to them, derived\r\nfrom shallows in the river on which they rested when congelation first\r\nreached the bottom.\r\n\r\nAs often as portions of these packs melt near the margin of the\r\nriver, the layers of mud, sand, and gravel, which result from their\r\nliquefaction, cannot fail to assume a very abnormal arrangement--very\r\nperplexing to a geologist who should undertake to interpret them without\r\nhaving the ice-clue in his mind.\r\n\r\nMr. Prestwich has suggested that ground-ice may have had its influence\r\nin modifying the ancient alluvium of the Somme.*\r\n\r\n     (* Prestwich, Memoir read to Royal Society, April 1862.)\r\n\r\nIt is certain that ice in this form plays an active part every winter\r\nin giving motion to stones and gravel in the beds of rivers in European\r\nRussia and Siberia. It appears that when in those countries the streams\r\nare reduced nearly to the freezing point, congelation begins frequently\r\nat the bottom; the reason being, according to Arago, that the current is\r\nslowest there, and the gravel and large stones, having parted with much\r\nof their heat by radiation, acquire a temperature below the average of\r\nthe main body of the river. It is, therefore, when the water is clear,\r\nand the sky free from clouds, that ground ice forms most readily, and\r\noftener on pebbly than on muddy bottoms. Fragments of such ice, rising\r\noccasionally to the surface, bring up with them gravel, and even large\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nWithout dwelling longer on the various ways in which ice may affect the\r\nforms of stratification in drift, so as to cause bendings and foldings\r\nin which the underlying or over-lying strata do not participate, a\r\nsubject to which I shall have occasion again to allude in the sequel,\r\nI will state in this place that such contortions, whether explicable or\r\nnot, are very characteristic of glacial formations. They have also no\r\nnecessary connection with the transportation of large blocks of stone,\r\nand they therefore afford, as Mr. Prestwich remarks, independent proof\r\nof ice-action in the Pleistocene gravel of the Somme.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, suppose that, at the time when flint hatchets were\r\nembedded in great numbers in the ancient gravel which now forms the\r\nterrace of St. Acheul, the main river and its tributaries were annually\r\nfrozen over for several months in winter. In that case, the primitive\r\npeople may, as Mr. Prestwich hints, have resembled in their mode of life\r\nthose American Indians who now inhabit the country between Hudson's Bay\r\nand the Polar Sea. The habits of those Indians have been well described\r\nby Hearne, who spent some years among them. As often as deer and other\r\ngame become scarce on the land, they betake themselves to fishing in\r\nthe rivers; and for this purpose, and also to obtain water for drinking,\r\nthey are in the constant practice of cutting round holes in the ice, a\r\nfoot or more in diameter, through which they throw baited hooks or nets.\r\nOften they pitch their tent on the ice, and then cut such holes through\r\nit, using ice-chisels of metal when they can get copper or iron, but\r\nwhen not, employing tools of flint or hornstone.\r\n\r\nThe great accumulation of gravel at St. Acheul has taken place in part\r\nof the valley where the tributary streams, the Noye and the Arve, now\r\njoin the Somme. These tributaries, as well as the main river, must have\r\nbeen running at the height first of 100 feet, and afterwards at various\r\nlower levels above the present valley-plain, in those earlier times\r\nwhen the flint tools of the antique type were buried in successive river\r\nbeds. I have said at various levels, because there are, here and there,\r\npatches of drift at heights intermediate between the higher and lower\r\ngravel, and also some deposits, showing that the river once flowed\r\nat elevations above as well as below the level of the platform of St.\r\nAcheul. As yet, however, no patch of gravel skirting the valley at\r\nheights exceeding 100 feet above the Somme has yielded flint tools or\r\nother signs of the former sojourn of Man in this region.\r\n\r\nPossibly, in the earlier geographical condition of this country, the\r\nconfluence of tributaries with the Somme afforded inducements to a\r\nhunting and fishing tribe to settle there, and some of the same natural\r\nadvantages may have caused the first inhabitants of Amiens and Abbeville\r\nto fix on the same sites for their dwellings. If the early hunting and\r\nfishing tribes frequented the same spots for hundreds or thousands of\r\nyears in succession, the number of the stone implements lost in the\r\nbed of the river need not surprise us. Ice-chisels, flint hatchets, and\r\nspear-heads may have slipped accidentally through holes kept constantly\r\nopen, and the recovery of a lost treasure once sunk in the bed of the\r\nice-bound stream, inevitably swept away with gravel on the breaking up\r\nof the ice in the spring, would be hopeless. During a long winter, in a\r\ncountry affording abundance of flint, the manufacture of tools would be\r\ncontinually in progress; and, if so, thousands of chips and flakes\r\nwould be purposely thrown into the ice-hole, besides a great number of\r\nimplements having flaws, or rejected as too unskilfully made to be worth\r\npreserving.\r\n\r\nAs to the fossil fauna of the drift, considered in relation to the\r\nclimate, when, in 1859, I took a collection which I had made of all the\r\nmore common species of land and freshwater shells from the Amiens and\r\nAbbeville drift, to my friend M. Deshayes at Paris, he declared them to\r\nbe, without exception, the same as those now living in the basin of the\r\nSeine. This fact may seem at first sight to imply that the climate had\r\nnot altered since the flint tools were fabricated; but it appears that\r\nall these species of molluscs now range as far north as Norway and\r\nFinland, and may therefore have flourished in the valley of the Somme\r\nwhen the river was frozen over annually in winter.*\r\n\r\n     (* See Prestwich, Paper read to the Royal Society in 1862.)\r\n\r\nIn regard to the accompanying mammalia, some of them, like the mammoth\r\nand tichorhine rhinoceros, may have been able to endure the rigours of\r\na northern winter as well as the reindeer, which we find fossil in\r\nthe same gravel. It is a more difficult point to determine whether the\r\nclimate of the lower gravels (those of Menchecourt, for example) was\r\nmore genial than that of the higher ones. Mr. Prestwich inclines to this\r\nopinion. None of those contortions of the strata above described have\r\nas yet been observed in the lower drift. It contains large blocks of\r\nTertiary sandstone and grit, which may have required the aid of ice to\r\nconvey them to their present sites; but as such blocks already abounded\r\nin the older and higher alluvium, they may simply be monuments of its\r\ndestruction, having been let down successively to lower and lower levels\r\nwithout making much seaward progress.\r\n\r\nThe Cyrena fluminalis of Menchecourt and the hippopotamus of St. Roch\r\nseem to be in favour of a less severe temperature in winter; but so\r\nmany of the species of mammalia, as well as of the land and freshwater\r\nshells, are common to both formations, and our information respecting\r\nthe entire fauna is still so imperfect, that it would be premature to\r\npretend to settle this question in the present state of our knowledge.\r\nWe must be content with the conclusion (and it is one of no small\r\ninterest), that when Man first inhabited this part of Europe, at the\r\ntime that the St. Acheul drift was formed, the climate as well as the\r\nphysical geography of the country differed considerably from the state\r\nof things now established there.\r\n\r\nAmong the elephant remains from St. Acheul, in M. Garnier's collection,\r\nDr. Falconer recognised a molar of the Elephas antiquus, Figure 19, the\r\nsame species which has been already mentioned as having been found in\r\nthe lower-level gravels of St. Roch. This species, therefore, endured\r\nwhile important changes took place in the geographical condition of the\r\nvalley of the Somme. Assuming the lower-level gravel to be the newer,\r\nit follows that the Elephas antiquus and the hippopotamus of St. Roch\r\ncontinued to flourish long after the introduction of the mammoth, a\r\nwell characterised tooth of which, as I before stated, was found at St.\r\nAcheul at the time of my visit in 1860.\r\n\r\nAs flint hatchets and knives have been discovered in the alluvial\r\ndeposits both at high and low levels, we may safely affirm that Man was\r\nas old an inhabitant of this region as were any of the fossil quadrupeds\r\nabove enumerated, a conclusion which is independent of any difference of\r\nopinion as to the relative age of the higher and lower gravels.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of many large pachyderms and beasts of prey from\r\nEurope has often been attributed to the intervention of Man, and no\r\ndoubt he played his part in hastening the era of their extinction; but\r\nthere is good reason for suspecting that other causes co-operated to\r\nthe same end. No naturalist would for a moment suppose that the\r\nextermination of the Cyrena fluminalis throughout the whole of Europe--a\r\nspecies which co-existed with our race in the valley of the Somme, and\r\nwhich was very abundant in the waters of the Thames at the time when\r\nthe elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus flourished on its banks--was\r\naccelerated by human agency. The great modification in climate and in\r\nother conditions of existence which affected this aquatic mollusc, may\r\nhave mainly contributed to the gradual dying out of many of the large\r\nmammalia.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the peat of the valley of the Somme is a\r\nformation which, in all likelihood, took thousands of years for\r\nits growth. But no change of a marked character has occurred in the\r\nmammalian fauna since it began to accumulate. The contrast of the fauna\r\nof the ancient alluvium, whether at high or low levels, with the fauna\r\nof the oldest peat is almost as great as its contrast with the existing\r\nfauna, the memorials of Man being common to the whole series; hence we\r\nmay infer that the interval of time which separated the era of the\r\nlarge extinct mammalia from that of the earliest peat, was of far longer\r\nduration than that of the entire growth of the peat. Yet we by no means\r\nneed the evidence of the ancient fossil fauna to establish the antiquity\r\nof Man in this part of France. The mere volume of the drift at various\r\nheights would alone suffice to demonstrate a vast lapse of time during\r\nwhich such heaps of shingle, derived both from the Eocene and the\r\nCretaceous rocks, were thrown down in a succession of river-channels. We\r\nobserve thousands of rounded and half-rounded flints, and a vast number\r\nof angular ones, with rounded pieces of white Chalk of various sizes,\r\ntestifying to a prodigious amount of mechanical action, accompanying\r\nthe repeated widening and deepening of the valley, before it became the\r\nreceptacle of peat; and the position of many of the flint tools leaves\r\nno doubt in the mind of the geologist that their fabrication preceded\r\nall this reiterated denudation.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE ABSENCE OF HUMAN BONES IN THE ALLUVIUM OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\nIt is naturally a matter of no small surprise that, after we have\r\ncollected many hundred flint implements (including knives, many\r\nthousands), not a single human bone has yet been met with in the old\r\nalluvial sand and gravel of the Somme. This dearth of the mortal remains\r\nof our species holds true equally, as yet, in all other parts of\r\nEurope where the tool-bearing drift of the Pleistocene period has been\r\ninvestigated in valley deposits. Yet in these same formations there is\r\nno want of bones of mammalia belonging to extinct and living species. In\r\nthe course of the last quarter of a century, thousands of them have been\r\nsubmitted to the examination of skilful osteologists, and they have been\r\nunable to detect among them one fragment of a human skeleton, not even\r\na tooth. Yet Cuvier pointed out long ago, that the bones of Man found\r\nburied in ancient battle-fields were not more decayed than those of\r\nhorses interred in the same graves. We have seen that in the Liege\r\ncaverns, the skulls, jaws, and teeth, with other bones of the human\r\nrace, were preserved in the same condition as those of the cave-bear,\r\ntiger, and mammoth.\r\n\r\nThat ere long, now that curiosity has been so much excited on this\r\nsubject, some human remains will be detected in the older alluvium of\r\nEuropean valleys, I confidently expect. In the meantime, the absence of\r\nall vestige of the bones which belonged to that population by which so\r\nmany weapons were designed and executed, affords a most striking and\r\ninstructive lesson in regard to the value of negative evidence, when\r\nadduced in proof of the non-existence of certain classes of terrestrial\r\nanimals at given periods of the past. It is a new and emphatic\r\nillustration of the extreme imperfection of the geological record, of\r\nwhich even they who are constantly working in the field cannot easily\r\nform a just conception.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget that Dr. Schmerling, after finding extinct mammalia\r\nand FLINT TOOLS in forty-two Belgian caverns, was only rewarded by the\r\ndiscovery of human bones in three or four of those rich repositories of\r\nosseous remains. In like manner, it was not till the year 1855 that\r\nthe first skull of the musk ox (Bubalus moschatus) was detected in the\r\nfossiliferous gravel of the Thames, and not till 1860, as will be\r\nseen in the next chapter, that the same quadruped was proved to have\r\nco-existed in France with the mammoth. The same theory which will\r\nexplain the comparative rarity of such species would no doubt account\r\nfor the still greater scarcity of human bones, as well as for our\r\ngeneral ignorance of the Pleistocene terrestrial fauna, with the\r\nexception of that part of it which is revealed to us by cavern\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\nIn valley drift we meet commonly with the bones of quadrupeds which\r\ngraze on plains bordering rivers. Carnivorous beasts, attracted to the\r\nsame ground in search of their prey, sometimes leave their remains\r\nin the same deposits, but more rarely. The whole assemblage of fossil\r\nquadrupeds at present obtained from the alluvium of Picardy is obviously\r\na mere fraction of the entire fauna which flourished contemporaneously\r\nwith the primitive people by whom the flint hatchets were made.\r\n\r\nInstead of its being part of the plan of nature to store up enduring\r\nrecords of a large number of the individual plants and animals which\r\nhave lived on the surface, it seems to be her chief care to provide the\r\nmeans of disencumbering the habitable areas lying above and below the\r\nwaters of those myriads of solid skeletons of animals, and those massive\r\ntrunks of trees, which would otherwise soon choke up every river, and\r\nfill every valley. To prevent this inconvenience she employs the heat\r\nand moisture of the sun and atmosphere, the dissolving power of carbonic\r\nand other acids, the grinding teeth and gastric juices of quadrupeds,\r\nbirds, reptiles, and fish, and the agency of many of the invertebrata.\r\nWe are all familiar with the efficacy of these and other causes on the\r\nland; and as to the bottoms of seas, we have only to read the published\r\nreports of Mr. MacAndrew, the late Edward Forbes, and other experienced\r\ndredgers, who, while they failed utterly in drawing up from the deep a\r\nsingle human bone, declared that they scarcely ever met with a work\r\nof art even after counting tens of thousands of shells and zoophytes,\r\ncollected on a coast line of several hundred miles in extent, where\r\nthey often approached within less than half a mile of a land peopled by\r\nmillions of human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE OF HAARLEM.\r\n\r\nIt is not many years since the Government of Holland resolved to lay dry\r\nthat great sheet of water formerly called the Lake of Haarlem, extending\r\nover 45,000 acres. They succeeded, in 1853, in turning it into dry land,\r\nby means of powerful pumps constantly worked by steam, which raised the\r\nwater and discharged it into a canal running for 20 or 30 miles round\r\nthe newly-gained land. This land was depressed 13 feet beneath the mean\r\nlevel of the ocean. I travelled, in 1859, over part of the bed of this\r\nold lake, and found it already converted into arable land, and peopled\r\nby an agricultural population of 5000 souls. Mr. Staring, who had\r\nbeen for some years employed by the Dutch Government in constructing a\r\ngeological map of Holland, was my companion and guide. He informed me\r\nthat he and his associates had searched in vain for human bones in the\r\ndeposits which had constituted for three centuries the bed of the great\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nThere had been many a shipwreck, and many a naval fight in those waters,\r\nand hundreds of Dutch and Spanish soldiers and sailors had met there\r\nwith a watery grave. The population which lived on the borders of this\r\nancient sheet of water numbered between thirty and forty thousand souls.\r\nIn digging the great canal, a fine section had been laid open, about 30\r\nmiles long, of the deposits which formed the ancient bottom of the lake.\r\nTrenches, also, innumerable, several feet deep, had been freshly dug on\r\nall the farms, and their united length must have amounted to thousands\r\nof miles. In some of the sandy soil recently thrown out of the trenches,\r\nI observed specimens of freshwater and brackish-water shells, such as\r\nUnio and Dreissena, of living species; and in clay brought up from below\r\nthe sand, shells of Tellina, Lutraria, and Cardium, all of species now\r\ninhabiting the adjoining sea.\r\n\r\nAs the Dreissena is believed by conchologists to have been introduced\r\ninto Western Europe in very modern times, brought with foreign timber\r\nin the holds of vessels from the rivers flowing into the Black Sea, the\r\nlayer of sand containing it in the Haarlem lake is probably not more\r\nthan a hundred years old.\r\n\r\nOne or two wrecked Spanish vessels, and arms of the same period, have\r\nrewarded the antiquaries who had been watching the draining operations\r\nin the hope of a richer harvest, and who were not a little disappointed\r\nat the result. In a peaty tract on the margin of one part of the lake a\r\nfew coins were dug up; but if history had been silent, and if there had\r\nbeen a controversy whether Man was already a denizen of this planet\r\nat the time when the area of the Haarlem lake was under water, the\r\narchaeologist, in order to answer this question, must have appealed,\r\nas in the case of the valley of the Somme, not to fossil bones, but to\r\nworks of art embedded in the superficial strata.\r\n\r\nMr. Staring, in his valuable memoir on the \"Geological Map of Holland,\"\r\nhas attributed the general scarcity of human bones in Dutch peat,\r\nnotwithstanding the many works of art preserved in it, to the power of\r\nthe humic and sulphuric acids to dissolve bones, the peat in question\r\nbeing plentifully impregnated with such acids. His theory may be\r\ncorrect, but it is not applicable to the gravel of the valley of the\r\nSomme, in which the bones of fossil mammalia are frequent, nor to the\r\nuppermost freshwater strata forming the bottom of a large part of the\r\nHaarlem Lake, in which it is not pretended that such acids occur.\r\n\r\nThe primitive inhabitants of the valley of the Somme may have been too\r\nwary and sagacious to be often surprised and drowned by floods, which\r\nswept away many an incautious elephant or rhinoceros, horse and ox. But\r\neven if those rude hunters had cherished a superstitious veneration for\r\nthe Somme, and had regarded it as a sacred river (as the modern Hindoos\r\nrevere the Ganges), and had been in the habit of committing the bodies\r\nof their dead or dying to its waters--even had such funeral rites\r\nprevailed, it by no means follows that the bones of many individuals\r\nwould have been preserved to our time.\r\n\r\nA corpse cast into the stream first sinks, and must then be almost\r\nimmediately overspread with sediment of a certain weight, or it will\r\nrise again when distended with gases, and float perhaps to the sea\r\nbefore it sinks again. It may then be attacked by fish of marine\r\nspecies, some of which are capable of digesting bones. If, before being\r\ncarried into the sea and devoured, it is enveloped with fluviatile mud\r\nand sand, the next flood, if it lie in mid-channel, may tear it out\r\nagain, scatter all the bones, roll some of them into pebbles, and\r\nleave others exposed to destroying agencies; and this may be repeated\r\nannually, till all vestiges of the skeleton may disappear. On the other\r\nhand, a bone washed through a rent into a subterranean cavity, even\r\nthough a rarer contingency, may have a greater chance of escaping\r\ndestruction, especially if there be stalactite dropping from the roof of\r\nthe cave or walls of a rent, and if the cave be not constantly traversed\r\nby too strong a current of engulfed water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. -- WORKS OF ART IN PLEISTOCENE ALLUVIUM OF FRANCE AND\r\nENGLAND.\r\n\r\n     Flint Implements in ancient Alluvium of the Basin of the Seine.\r\n     Bones of Man and of extinct Mammalia in the Cave of Arcy.\r\n     Extinct Mammalia in the Valley of the Oise.\r\n     Flint Implement in Gravel of same Valley.\r\n     Works of Art in Pleistocene Drift in Valley of the Thames.\r\n     Musk Ox.\r\n     Meeting of northern and southern Fauna.\r\n     Migrations of Quadrupeds.\r\n     Mammals of Mongolia.\r\n     Chronological Relation of the older Alluvium of the Thames to the\r\n        Glacial Drift.\r\n     Flint Implements of Pleistocene Period in Surrey, Middlesex, Kent,\r\n        Bedfordshire, and Suffolk.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLINT IMPLEMENTS IN PLEISTOCENE ALLUVIUM IN THE BASIN OF THE SEINE.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient alluvium of the valleys of the Seine and its principal\r\ntributaries, the same assemblage of fossil animals, which has been\r\nalluded to in the last chapter as characterising the gravel of Picardy,\r\nhas long been known; but it was not till the year 1860, and when\r\ndiligent search had been expressly made for them, that flint implements\r\nof the Amiens type were discovered in this part of France.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Paris deposits of drift occur answering both to\r\nthose of the higher and lower levels of the basin of the Somme before\r\ndescribed.*\r\n\r\n     (* Prestwich, \"Proceedings of the Royal Society\" 1862.)\r\n\r\nIn both are found, mingled with the wreck of the Tertiary and Cretaceous\r\nrocks of the vicinity, a large quantity of granitic sand and pebbles,\r\nand occasionally large blocks of granite, from a few inches to a foot\r\nor more in diameter. These blocks are peculiarly abundant in the lower\r\ndrift commonly called the \"diluvium gris.\" The granitic materials are\r\ntraceable to a chain of hills called the Morvan, where the head waters\r\nof the Yonne take their rise, 150 miles to the south-south-east of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nIt was in this lowest gravel that M. H.T. Gosse, of Geneva, found, in\r\nApril 1860, in the suburbs of Paris, at La Motte Piquet, on the left\r\nbank of the Seine, one or two well-formed flint implements of the Amiens\r\ntype, accompanied by a great number of ruder tools or attempts at tools.\r\nI visited the spot in 1861 with M. Hebert, and saw the stratum from\r\nwhich the worked flints had been extracted, 20 feet below the surface,\r\nand near the bottom of the \"grey diluvium,\" a bed of gravel from which\r\nI have myself, in and near Paris, frequently collected the bones of the\r\nelephant, horse, and other mammalia.\r\n\r\nMore recently, M. Lartet has discovered at Clichy, in the environs of\r\nParis, in the same lower gravel, a well-shaped flint implement of the\r\nAmiens type, together with remains both of Elephas primigenius and\r\nE. antiquus. No tools have yet been met with in any of the gravels\r\noccurring at the higher levels of the valley of the Seine; but no\r\nimportance can be attached to this negative fact, as so little search\r\nhas yet been made for them.\r\n\r\nMr. Prestwich has observed contortions indicative of ice-action, of the\r\nsame kind as those near Amiens, in the higher-level drift of Charonne,\r\nnear Paris; but as yet no similar derangement has been seen in the\r\nlower gravels--a fact, so far as it goes, in unison with the phenomena\r\nobserved in Picardy.\r\n\r\nIn the cavern of Arcy-sur-Yonne a series of deposits have lately been\r\ninvestigated by the Marquis de Vibraye, who discovered human bones in\r\nthe lowest of them, mixed with remains of quadrupeds of extinct and\r\nrecent species. This cavern occurs in Jurassic limestone, at a slight\r\nelevation above the Cure, a small tributary of the Yonne, which last\r\njoins the Seine near Fontainebleau about 40 miles south of Paris. The\r\nlowest formation in the cavern resembles the \"diluvium gris\" of Paris,\r\nbeing composed of granitic materials, and like it derived chiefly from\r\nthe waste of the crystalline rocks of the Morvan. In it have been found\r\nthe two branches of a human lower jaw with teeth well-preserved, and\r\nthe bones of the Elephas primigenius, Rhinoceros tichorhinus, Ursus\r\nspelaeus, Hyaena spelaea, and Cervus tarandus, all specifically\r\ndetermined by M. Lartet. I have been shown this collection of fossils by\r\nM. de Vibraye, and remarked that the human and other remains were in the\r\nsame condition and of the same colour.\r\n\r\nAbove the grey gravel is a bed of red alluvium, made up of fragments of\r\nJurassic limestone, in a red argillaceous matrix, in which were embedded\r\nseveral flint knives, with bones of the reindeer and horse, but no\r\nextinct mammalia. Over this, in a higher bed of alluvium, were several\r\npolished hatchets of the more modern type called \"celts,\" and above all\r\nloam or cave-mud, in which were Gallo-Roman antiquities.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Bulletin de la Societe Geologique de France\" 1860.)\r\n\r\nThe French geologists have made as yet too little progress in\r\nidentifying the age of the successive deposits of ancient alluvium of\r\nvarious parts of the basin of the Seine, to enable us to speculate with\r\nconfidence as to the coincidence in date of the granitic gravel with\r\nhuman bones of the Grotte d'Arcy and the stone-hatchets buried in \"grey\r\ndiluvium\" of La Motte Piquet, before mentioned; but as the associated\r\nextinct mammalia are of the same species in both localities, I feel\r\nstrongly inclined to believe that the stone hatchets found by M. Gosse\r\nat Paris, and the human bones discovered by M. de Vibraye, may be\r\nreferable to the same period.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALLEY OF THE OISE.\r\n\r\nA flint hatchet, of the old Abbeville and Amiens type, was found lately\r\nby M. Peigne Delacourt at Precy, near Creil, on the Oise, in gravel,\r\nresembling, in its geological position, the lower-level gravels of\r\nMontiers, near Amiens, already described. I visited these extensive\r\ngravel-pits in 1861, in company with Mr. Prestwich; but we remained\r\nthere too short a time to entitle us to expect to find a flint\r\nimplement, even if they had been as abundant as at St. Acheul.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, I examined, in a higher part of the same valley of the\r\nOise, near Chauny and Noyon, some fine railway cuttings, which passed\r\ncontinuously through alluvium of the Pleistocene period for half a\r\nmile. All this alluvium was evidently of fluviatile origin, for, in\r\nthe interstices between the pebbles, the Ancylus fluviatilis and other\r\nfreshwater shells were abundant. My companion, the Abbe E. Lambert,\r\nhad collected from the gravel a great many fossil bones, among which M.\r\nLartet has recognised both Elephas primigenius and E. antiquus, besides\r\na species of hippopotamus (H. major?), also the reindeer, horse, and the\r\nmusk ox (Bubalus moschatus). The latter seems never to have been seen\r\nbefore in the old alluvium of France.*\r\n\r\n     (* Lartet, \"Annales des Sciences Naturelles Zoologiques\"\r\n     tome 15 page 224.)\r\n\r\nOver the gravel above mentioned, near Chauny, are seen dense masses of\r\nloam like the loess of the Rhine, containing shells of the genera\r\nHelix and Succinea. We may suppose that the gravel containing the flint\r\nhatchet at Precy is of the same age as that of Chauny, with which it is\r\ncontinuous, and that both of them are coeval with the tool-bearing beds\r\nof Amiens, for the basins of the Oise and the Somme are only separated\r\nby a narrow water-shed, and the same fossil quadrupeds occur in both.\r\n\r\nThe alluvium of the Seine and its tributaries, like that of the Somme,\r\ncontains no fragments of rocks brought from any other hydrographical\r\nbasin; yet the shape of the land, or fall of the river, or the climate,\r\nor all these conditions, must have been very different when the grey\r\nalluvium in which the flint tools occur at Paris was formed. The great\r\nsize of some of the blocks of granite, and the distance which they have\r\ntravelled, imply a power in the river which it no longer possesses. We\r\ncan hardly doubt that river-ice once played a much more active part than\r\nnow in the transportation of such blocks, one of which may be seen in\r\nthe Museum of the Ecole des Mines at Paris, 3 or 4 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEISTOCENE ALLUVIUM OF ENGLAND, CONTAINING WORKS OF ART.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient alluvium of the basin of the Thames, at moderate heights\r\nabove the main river and its tributaries, we find fossil bones of the\r\nsame species of extinct and living mammalia, accompanied by recent\r\nspecies of land and freshwater shells, as we have shown to be\r\ncharacteristic of the basins of the Somme and the Seine. We can\r\nscarcely therefore doubt that these quadrupeds, during some part of\r\nthe Pleistocene period, ranged freely from the continent of Europe to\r\nEngland, at a time when there was an uninterrupted communication by land\r\nbetween the two countries. The reader will not therefore be surprised\r\nto learn that flint implements of the same antique type as those of the\r\nvalley of the Somme have been detected in British alluvium.\r\n\r\nThe most marked feature of this alluvium in the Thames valley is that\r\ngreat bed of ochreous gravel, composed chiefly of broken and slightly\r\nworn Chalk flints, on which a great part of London is built. It extends\r\nfrom above Maidenhead through the metropolis to the sea, a distance from\r\nwest to east of 50 miles, having a width varying from 2 to 9 miles. Its\r\nthickness ranges commonly from 5 to 15 feet.*\r\n\r\n     (* Prestwich, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\"\r\n     volume 12 1856 page 131.)\r\n\r\nInterstratified with this gravel, in many places, are beds of sand,\r\nloam, and clay, the whole containing occasionally remains of the mammoth\r\nand other extinct quadrupeds. Fine sections have been exposed to view,\r\nat different periods, at Brentford and Kew Bridge, others in London\r\nitself, and below it at Erith in Kent, on the right bank of the Thames,\r\nand at Ilford and Gray's Thurrock in Essex, on the left bank. The united\r\nthickness of the beds of sand, gravel, and loam amounts sometimes to 40\r\nor even 60 feet. They are for the most part elevated above, but in some\r\ncases they descend below, the present level of the overflowed plain of\r\nthe Thames.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will refer to the section of the Pleistocene sands and\r\ngravels of Menchecourt, near Abbeville, given at page 96, he will\r\nperfectly understand the relations of the ancient Thames alluvium to the\r\nmodern channel and plain of the river, and their relation, on the other\r\nhand, to the boundary formations of older date, whether Tertiary or\r\nCretaceous.\r\n\r\nSo far as they are known, the fossil mollusca and mammalia of the two\r\ndistricts also agree very closely, the Cyrena fluminalis being common to\r\nboth, and being the only extra-European shell, this and all the species\r\nof testacea being Recent. Of this agreement with the living fauna there\r\nis a fine illustration in Essex; for the determination of which we are\r\nindebted to the late Mr. John Brown, F.G.S., who collected at Copford,\r\nin Essex, from a deposit containing bones of the mammoth, a large bear\r\n(probably Ursus spelaeus), a beaver, stag, and aurochs, no less than\r\nsixty-nine species of land and freshwater shells. Forty-eight of these\r\nwere terrestrial, and two of them, Helix incarnata and H. ruderata, no\r\nlonger inhabit the British Isles, but are still living on the continent,\r\nruderata in high northern latitudes.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 8\r\n     1852 page 190. Mr. Brown calls them extinct species, which\r\n     may mislead some readers, but he merely meant extinct in\r\n     England. See also Jeffreys, \"Brit. Conch.\" page 174.)\r\n\r\nThe Cyrena fluminalis and the Unio littoralis, to which last I shall\r\npresently allude, were not among the number.\r\n\r\nI long ago suggested the hypothesis, that in the basin of the Thames\r\nthere are indications of a meeting in the Pleistocene period of a\r\nnorthern and southern fauna. To the northern group may have belonged the\r\nmammoth (Elephas primigenius) and the Rhinoceros tichorhinus, both of\r\nwhich Pallas found in Siberia, preserved with their flesh in the ice.\r\nWith these are occasionally associated the reindeer. In 1855 the skull\r\nof the musk ox (Bubalus moschatus) was also found in the ochreous\r\ngravel of Maidenhead, by the Reverend C. Kingsley and Mr. Lubbock; the\r\nidentification of this fossil with the living species being made by\r\nProfessor Owen. A second fossil skull of the same arctic animal was\r\nafterwards found by Mr. Lubbock near Bromley, in the valley of a small\r\ntributary of the Thames; and two other skulls, those of a bull and a cow\r\nwere dug up near Bath Easton from the gravel of the valley of the Avon\r\nby Mr. Charles Moore. Professor Owen has truly said, that \"as this\r\nquadruped has a constitution fitting it at present to inhabit the\r\nhigh northern regions of America, we can hardly doubt that its former\r\ncompanions, the warmly-clad mammoth and the two-horned woolly rhinoceros\r\n(R. tichorhinus), were in like manner capable of supporting life in a\r\ncold climate.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 12\r\n     1856 page 124.)\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to the recent discovery of this same ox near\r\nChauny, in the valley of the Oise, in France; and in 1856 I found\r\na skull of it preserved in the museum at Berlin, which Professor\r\nQuenstedt, the curator, had correctly named so long ago as 1836, when\r\nthe fossil was dug out of drift, in the hill called the Kreuzberg, in\r\nthe southern suburbs of that city. By an account published at the time,\r\nwe find that the mammalia which accompanied the musk ox were the mammoth\r\nand tichorhine rhinoceros, with the horse and ox;* but I can find no\r\nrecord of the occurrence of a hippopotamus, nor of Elephas antiquus or\r\nRhinoceros leptorhinus, in the drift of the north of Germany, bordering\r\nthe Baltic.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Leonhard and Bronn's Jahrbuch\" 1836 page 215.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in another locality in the same drift of North\r\nGermany, Dr. Hensel, of Berlin, detected, near Quedlinburg, the\r\nNorwegian Lemming (Myodes lemmus), and another species of the same\r\nfamily called by Pallas Myodes torquatus (by Hensel, Misothermus\r\ntorquatus)--a still more arctic quadruped, found by Parry in latitude 82\r\ndegrees, and which never strays farther south than the northern borders\r\nof the woody region. Professor Beyrich also informs me that the remains\r\nof the Rhinoceros tichorhinus were obtained at the same place.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Zeitschrift der Deutschen Geologischen Gesellschaft\"\r\n     volume 7 1855 page 497 etc.)\r\n\r\nAs an example of what may possibly have constituted a more southern\r\nfauna in the valley of the Thames, I may allude to the fossil remains\r\nfound in the fluviatile alluvium of Gray's Thurrock, in Essex, situated\r\non the left bank of the river, 21 miles below London. The strata of\r\nbrick-earth, loam, and gravel exposed to view in artificial excavations\r\nin that spot, are precisely such as would be formed by the silting up\r\nof an old river channel. Among the mammalia are Elephas antiquus,\r\nRhinoceros leptorhinus (R. megarhinus, Christol), Hippopotamus major,\r\nspecies of horse, bear, ox, stag, etc., and, among the accompanying\r\nshells, Cyrena fluminalis, which is extremely abundant, instead of being\r\nscarce, as at Abbeville. It is associated with Unio littoralis also in\r\ngreat numbers and with both valves united. This conspicuous freshwater\r\nmussel is no longer an inhabitant of the British Isles, but still\r\nlives in the Seine, and is still more abundant in the Loire. Another\r\nfreshwater univalve (Paludina marginata, Michaud), not British, but\r\ncommon in the south of France, likewise occurs, and a peculiar variety\r\nof Cyclas amnica, which by some naturalists has been regarded as a\r\ndistinct species. With these, moreover, is found a peculiar variety of\r\nValvata piscinalis.\r\n\r\nIf we consult Dr. Von Schrenck's account of the living mammalia of\r\nMongolia, lying between latitude 45 and 55 degrees north, we learn\r\nthat, in that part of North-Eastern Asia recently annexed to the Russian\r\nempire, no less than thirty-four out of fifty-eight living quadrupeds\r\nare identical with European species, while some of those which do not\r\nextend their range to Europe are arctic, others tropical forms. The\r\nBengal tiger ranges northwards occasionally to latitude 52 degrees\r\nnorth, where he chiefly subsists on the flesh of the reindeer, and the\r\nsame tiger abounds in latitude 48 degrees, to which the small tailless\r\nhare or pika, a polar resident, sometimes wanders southwards.*\r\n\r\n     (* Mammalia of Amoorland, \"Natural History Review\" volume 1\r\n     1861 page 12.)\r\n\r\nWe may readily conceive that the countries now drained by the Thames,\r\nthe Somme, and the Seine, were, in the Pleistocene period, on the\r\nborders of two distinct zoological provinces, one lying to the north,\r\nthe other to the south, in which case many species belonging to each\r\nfauna endowed with migratory habits, like the living musk-ox or the\r\nBengal tiger, may have been ready to take advantage of any, even the\r\nslightest, change in their favour to invade the neighbouring province,\r\nwhether in the summer or winter months, or permanently for a series of\r\nyears, or centuries. The Elephas antiquus and its associated Rhinoceros\r\nleptorhinus may have preceded the mammoth and tichorhine rhinoceros in\r\nthe valley of the Thames, or both may have alternately prevailed in the\r\nsame area in the Pleistocene period.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to settle the chronology of fluviatile deposits, it is\r\nalmost equally difficult to avail ourselves of the evidence of organic\r\nremains and of the superposition of the strata, for we may find two old\r\nriver-beds on the same level in juxtaposition, one of them perhaps\r\nmany thousands of years posterior in date to the other. I have seen an\r\nexample of this at Ilford, where the Thames, or a tributary stream, has\r\nat some former period cut through sands containing Cyrena fluminalis,\r\nand again filled up the channel with argillaceous matter, evidently\r\nderived from the waste of the Tertiary London Clay. Such shiftings\r\nof the site of the main channel of the river, the frequent removal\r\nof gravel and sand previously deposited, and the throwing down of new\r\nalluvium, the flooding of tributaries, the rising and sinking of the\r\nland, fluctuations in the cold and heat of the climate--all these\r\nchanges seem to have given rise to that complexity in the fluviatile\r\ndeposits of the Thames, which accounts for the small progress we have\r\nhitherto made in determining their order of succession, and that of\r\nthe imbedded groups of quadrupeds. It may happen, as at Brentford and\r\nIlford, that sand-pits in two adjoining fields may each contain distinct\r\nspecies of elephant and rhinoceros; and the fossil remains in both\r\ncases may occur at the same depth from the surface, yet may be severally\r\nreferable to different parts of the Pleistocene epoch, separated by\r\nthousands of years.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the glacial period to alluvial deposits, such as that of\r\nGray's Thurrock, where the Cyrena fluminalis, Unio littoralis, and the\r\nhippopotamus seem rather to imply a warmer climate, has been a matter\r\nof long and animated discussion. Patches of the northern drift,\r\nat elevations of about 200 feet above the Thames, occur in the\r\nneighbourhood of London, as at Muswell Hill, near Highgate. In this\r\ndrift, blocks of granite, syenite, greenstone, Coal-measure sandstone\r\nwith its fossils, and other Palaeozoic rocks, and the wreck of Chalk and\r\nOolite, occur confusedly mixed together. The same glacial formation\r\nis also found capping some of the Essex hills farther to the east, and\r\nextending some way down their southern slopes towards the valley of\r\nthe Thames. Although no fragments washed out of these older and upland\r\ndrifts have been found in the gravel of the Thames containing elephants'\r\nbones, it is fair to presume, as Mr. Prestwich has contended,* that the\r\nglacial formation is the older of the two.\r\n\r\n     (* Prestwich, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\"\r\n     volume 11 1855 page 110; ibid. volume 12 1856 page 133;\r\n     ibid. volume 17 1861 page 446.)\r\n\r\nIn short, we must suppose that the basin of the Thames and all its\r\nfluviatile deposits are post-glacial, in the modified sense of that\r\nterm; i.e. that they were subsequent to the drift of the central and\r\nnorthern counties.\r\n\r\nHaving offered these general remarks on the alluvium of the Thames, I\r\nmay now say something of the implements hitherto discovered in it. In\r\nthe British Museum there is a flint weapon of the spear-headed form,\r\nsuch as is represented in Figure 8, which we are told was found with\r\nan elephant's tooth at Black Mary's, near Gray's Inn Lane, London. In a\r\nletter dated 1715, printed in Herne's edition of \"Leland's Collectanea,\"\r\nvolume 1 page 73, it is stated to have been found in the presence of Mr.\r\nConyers, with the skeleton of an elephant.*\r\n\r\n     (* Evans, \"Archaeologia\" 1860.)\r\n\r\nSo many bones of the elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus have been\r\nfound in the gravel on which London stands, that there is no reason to\r\ndoubt the statement as handed down to us. Fossil remains of all these\r\nthree genera have been dug up on the site of Waterloo Place, St. James's\r\nSquare, Charing Cross, the London Docks, Limehouse, Bethnal Green, and\r\nother places within the memory of persons now living. In the gravel and\r\nsand of Shacklewell, in the north-east district of London, I have myself\r\ncollected specimens of the Cyrena fluminalis in great numbers (see\r\nFigure 17 c), with the bones of deer and other mammalia.\r\n\r\nIn the alluvium also of the Wey, near Guildford, in a place called Pease\r\nMarsh, a wedge-shaped flint implement, resembling one brought from\r\nSt. Acheul by Mr. Prestwich, and compared by some antiquaries to a\r\nsling-stone, was obtained in 1836 by Mr. Whitburn, 4 feet deep in sand\r\nand gravel, in which the teeth and tusks of elephants had been found.\r\nThe Wey flows through the gorge of the North Downs at Guildford to join\r\nthe Thames. Mr. Austen has shown that this drift is so ancient that one\r\npart of it had been disturbed and tilted before another part was thrown\r\ndown.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 7\r\n     1851 page 278.)\r\n\r\nAmong other places where flint tools of the antique type have been met\r\nwith in the course of the last three years, I may mention one of an oval\r\nform found by Mr. Whitaker in the valley of the Darent, in Kent, and\r\nanother which Mr. Evans found lying on the shore at Swalecliff, near\r\nWhitstable, in the same county, where Mr. Prestwich had previously\r\ndescribed a freshwater deposit, resting on the London Clay, and\r\nconsisting chiefly of gravel, in which an elephant's tooth and the bones\r\nof a bear were embedded. The flint implement was deeply discoloured\r\nand of a peculiar bright light-brown colour, similar to that of the old\r\nfluviatile gravel in the cliff.\r\n\r\nAnother flint implement was found in 1860 by Mr. T. Leech, at the foot\r\nof the cliff between Herne Bay and the Reculvers, and on further search\r\nfive other specimens of the spear-head pattern so common at Amiens.\r\nMessrs. Prestwich and Evans have since found three other similar tools\r\non the beach, at the base of the same wasting cliff, which consists of\r\nsandy Eocene strata, covered by a gravelly deposit of freshwater origin,\r\nabout 50 feet above the sea-level, from which the flint weapons must\r\nhave been derived. Such old alluvial deposits now capping the cliffs\r\nof Kent seem to have been the river-beds of tributaries of the Thames\r\nbefore the sea encroached to its present position and widened its\r\nestuary. On following up one of these freshwater deposits westward of\r\nthe Reculvers, Mr. Prestwich found in it, at Chislet, near Grove Ferry,\r\nthe Cyrena fluminalis among other shells.\r\n\r\nThe changes which have taken place in the physical geography of this\r\npart of England during, or since, the Pleistocene period, have consisted\r\npartly of such encroachments of the sea on the coast as are now going\r\non, and partly of a general subsidence of the land. Among the signs\r\nof the latter movement may be mentioned a freshwater formation at\r\nFaversham, below the level of the sea. The gravel there contains\r\nexclusively land and fluviatile shells of the same species as those of\r\nother localities of the Pleistocene alluvium before mentioned, and\r\nmust have been formed when the river was at a higher level and when it\r\nextended farther east. At that era it was probably a tributary of the\r\nRhine, as represented by Mr. Trimmer in his ideal restoration of the\r\ngeography of the olden time.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 9\r\n     1853 Plate 8 Number 4.)\r\n\r\nFor England was then united to the continent, and what is now the North\r\nSea was land. It is well known that in many places, especially near the\r\ncoast of Holland, elephants' tusks and other bones are often dredged\r\nup from the bed of that shallow sea, and the reader will see in the map\r\ngiven in Chapter 13 how vast would be the conversion of sea into land by\r\nan upheaval of 600 feet. Vertical movements of much less than half that\r\namount would account for the annexation of England to the continent, and\r\nthe extension of the Thames and its valley far to the north-east, and\r\nthe flowing of rivers from the easternmost parts of Kent and Essex into\r\nthe Thames, instead of emptying themselves into its estuary.\r\n\r\nMore than a dozen flint weapons of the Amiens type have already been\r\nfound in the basin of the Thames; but the geological position of no one\r\nof them has as yet been ascertained with the same accuracy as that of\r\nmany of the tools dug up in the valley of the Somme.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLINT IMPLEMENTS OF THE VALLEY OF THE OUSE, NEAR BEDFORD.\r\n\r\nThe ancient fluviatile gravel of the valley of the Ouse, around Bedford,\r\nhas been noted for the last thirty years for yielding to collectors a\r\nrich harvest of the bones of extinct mammalia. By observations made in\r\n1854 and 1858, Mr. Prestwich had ascertained that the valley was bounded\r\non both sides by Oolitic strata, capped by boulder clay, and that the\r\ngravel Number 3, Figure 23, contained bones of the elephant, rhinoceros,\r\nhippopotamus, ox, horse, and deer, which animals he therefore inferred\r\nmust have been posterior in date to the boulder clay, through which, as\r\nwell as the subjacent Oolite, the valley had been excavated. Mr. Evans\r\nhad found in the same gravel many land and freshwater shells, and these\r\ndiscoveries induced Mr. James Wyatt, of Bedford, to pay two visits to\r\nSt. Acheul in order to compare the implement-bearing gravels of the\r\nSomme with the drift of the valley of the Ouse. After his return\r\nhe resolved to watch carefully the excavation of the gravel-pits at\r\nBiddenham, 2 miles west-north-west of Bedford, in the hope of finding\r\nthere similar works of art. With this view he paid almost daily visits\r\nfor months in succession to those pits, and was at last rewarded by the\r\ndiscovery of two well-formed implements, one of the spear-head and the\r\nother of the oval shape, perfect counterparts of the two prevailing\r\nFrench types. Both specimens were thrown out by the workmen on the same\r\nday from the lowest bed of stratified gravel and sand, 13 feet thick,\r\ncontaining bones of the elephant, deer, and ox, and many freshwater\r\nshells. The two implements occurred at the depth of 13 feet from the\r\nsurface of the soil, and rested immediately on solid beds of Oolitic\r\nlimestone, as represented in the accompanying section (Figure 23).\r\n\r\nHaving been invited by Mr. Wyatt to verify these facts, I went to\r\nBiddenham within a fortnight of the date of his discovery (April\r\n1861), and, for the first time, saw evidence which satisfied me of the\r\nchronological relations of those three phenomena, the antique tools, the\r\nextinct mammalia, and the glacial formation. On that occasion I examined\r\nthe pits in company with Messrs. Prestwich, Evans, and Wyatt, and we\r\ncollected ten species of shells from the stratified drift Number 3, or\r\nthe beds overlying the lowest gravel from which the flint implements had\r\nbeen exhumed. They were all of common fluviatile and land species now\r\nliving in the same part of England. Since our visit, Mr. Wyatt has\r\nadded to them Paludina marginata, Michaud (Hydrobia of some authors), a\r\nspecies of the South of France no longer inhabiting the British Isles.\r\nThe same geologist has also found, since we were at Biddenham, several\r\nother flint tools of corresponding type, both there and at other\r\nlocalities in the valley of the Ouse, near Bedford.\r\n\r\n[Figure 23. Valley of the Ouse]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 23. SECTION ACROSS THE VALLEY OF THE OUSE, TWO MILES\r\n  WEST-NORTH-WEST OF BEDFORD.*\r\n    (* Prestwich, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\"\r\n    volume 17 1861 page 364; and Wyatt, \"Geologist\" 1861 page 242.)\r\n\r\n  1. Oolitic strata.\r\n  2. Boulder clay, or marine northern drift, rising to about\r\n     ninety feet above the Ouse.\r\n  3. Ancient gravel, with elephant bones, freshwater shells,\r\n     and flint implements.\r\n  4. Modern alluvium of the Ouse.\r\n  a. Biddenham gravel pits, at the bottom of which flint tools\r\n     were found.)\r\n\r\nThe boulder clay Number 2 extends for miles in all directions, and was\r\nevidently once continuous from b to c before the valley was scooped\r\nout. It is a portion of the great marine glacial drift of the midland\r\ncounties of England, and contains blocks, some of large size, not\r\nonly of the Oolite of the neighbourhood, but of Chalk and other rocks\r\ntransported from still greater distances, such as syenite, basalt,\r\nquartz, and New Red Sandstone. These erratic blocks of foreign origin\r\nare often polished and striated, having undergone what is called\r\nglaciation, of which more will be said by and by. Blocks of the same\r\nmineral character, embedded at Biddenham in the gravel Number 3, have\r\nlost all signs of this striation by the friction to which they were\r\nsubjected in the old river bed.\r\n\r\nThe great width of the valley of the Ouse, which is sometimes 2 miles,\r\nhas not been expressed in the diagram. It may have been shaped out by\r\nthe joint action of the river and the tides when this part of England\r\nwas emerging from the waters of the glacial sea, the boulder clay being\r\nfirst cut through, and then an equal thickness of underlying Oolite.\r\nAfter this denudation, which may have accompanied the emergence of the\r\nland, the country was inhabited by the primitive people who fashioned\r\nthe flint tools. The old river, aided perhaps by the continued upheaval\r\nof the whole country, or by oscillations in its level, went on widening\r\nand deepening the valley, often shifting its channel, until at length\r\na broad area was covered by a succession of the earliest and latest\r\ndeposits, which may have corresponded in age to the higher and lower\r\ngravels of the valley of the Somme, already described.\r\n\r\nAt Biddenham, and elsewhere in the same gravel, remains of Elephas\r\nantiquus have been discovered, and Mr. Wyatt obtained, January 1863,\r\na flint implement associated with bones and teeth of hippopotamus from\r\ngravel at Summerhouse hill, which lies east of Bedford, lower down the\r\nvalley of the Ouse, and 4 miles from Biddenham.\r\n\r\nOne step at least we gain by the Bedford sections, which those of\r\nAmiens and Abbeville had not enabled us to make. They teach us that the\r\nfabricators of the antique tools, and the extinct mammalia coeval with\r\nthem, were all post-glacial.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLINT IMPLEMENTS IN A FRESHWATER DEPOSIT AT HOXNE IN SUFFOLK [17].\r\n\r\nSo early as the first year of the nineteenth century, a remarkable paper\r\nwas communicated to the Society of Antiquaries by Mr. John Frere, in\r\nwhich he gave a clear description of the discovery at Hoxne, near Diss,\r\nin Suffolk, of flint tools of the type since found at Amiens, adding at\r\nthe same time good geological reasons for presuming that their antiquity\r\nwas very great, or, as he expressed it, beyond that of the present\r\nworld, meaning the actual state of the physical geography of that\r\nregion. \"The flints,\" he said, \"were evidently weapons of war,\r\nfabricated and used by a people who had not the use of metals. They\r\nlay in great numbers at the depth of about 12 feet in a stratified soil\r\nwhich was dug into for the purpose of raising clay for bricks. Under\r\na foot and a half of vegetable earth was clay 7 1/2 feet thick, and\r\nbeneath this one foot of sand with shells, and under this 2 feet of\r\ngravel, in which the shaped flints were found generally at the rate of\r\n5 or 6 in a square yard. In the sandy beds with shells were found the\r\njawbone and teeth of an enormous unknown animal. The manner in which the\r\nflint weapons lay would lead to the persuasion that it was a place of\r\ntheir manufacture, and not of their accidental deposit. Their numbers\r\nwere so great that the man who carried on the brick-work told me that\r\nbefore he was aware of their being objects of curiosity, he had emptied\r\nbaskets full of them into the ruts of the adjoining road.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Frere then goes on to explain that the strata in which the flints\r\noccur are disposed horizontally, and do not lie at the foot of any\r\nhigher ground, so that portions of them must have been removed when the\r\nadjoining valley was hollowed out. If the author had not mistaken the\r\nfreshwater shells associated with the tools for marine species, there\r\nwould have been nothing to correct in his account of the geology of\r\nthe district, for he distinctly perceived that the strata in which the\r\nimplements were embedded had, since that time, undergone very extensive\r\ndenudation.*\r\n\r\n     (* Frere, \"Archaeologia\" volume 13 1800 page 206.)\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the flint spear-heads, sent to London by Mr. Frere, are\r\nstill preserved in the British Museum, and others are in the collection\r\nof the Society of Antiquaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 24. Position of Flint Weapons]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 24. SECTION SHOWING THE POSITION OF THE FLINT WEAPONS\r\n   AT HOXNE, NEAR DISS, SUFFOLK.\r\n     See Prestwich \"Philosophical Transactions\" Plate 11 1860.)\r\n\r\n  1.

Sand and gravel below boulder clay.\r\n  8. Chalk with flints.)\r\n\r\nMr. Prestwich's attention was called by Mr. Evans to these weapons, as\r\nwell as to Mr. Frere's memoir after his return from Amiens in 1859,\r\nand he lost no time in visiting Hoxne, a village five miles eastward of\r\nDiss. It is not a little remarkable that he should have found, after a\r\nlapse of sixty years, that the extraction of clay was still going on\r\nin the same brick-pit. Only a few months before his arrival, two flint\r\ninstruments had been dug out of the clay, one from a depth of 7 and the\r\nother of 10 feet from the surface. Others have since been disinterred\r\nfrom undisturbed beds of gravel in the same pit. Mr. Amyot of Diss has\r\nalso obtained from the underlying freshwater strata the astragalus of an\r\nelephant, and bones of the deer and horse; but although many of the old\r\nimplements have recently been discovered in situ in regular strata and\r\npreserved by Sir Edward Kerrison, no bones of extinct mammalia seem\r\nas yet to have been actually seen in the same stratum with one of the\r\ntools.\r\n\r\nBy reference to the annexed section, the geologist will see that the\r\nbasin-shaped hollow a, b, c has been filled up gradually with the\r\nfreshwater strata 3, 4, 5, after the same cavity a, b, c had been\r\npreviously excavated out of the more ancient boulder clay Number 6. The\r\nrelative position of these formations will be better understood when\r\nI have described in the twelfth chapter the structure of Norfolk and\r\nSuffolk as laid open in the sea-cliffs at Mundesley, about 30 miles\r\ndistant from Hoxne, in a north-north-east direction.\r\n\r\nI examined the deposits at Hoxne in 1860, when I had the advantage of\r\nbeing accompanied by the Reverend J. Gunn and the Reverend S.W. King.\r\nIn the loamy beds 3 and 4, Figure 24, we observed the common river shell\r\nValvata piscinalis in great numbers. With it, but much more rare, were\r\nLimnaea palustris, Planorbis albus, P. Spirorbis, Succinea putris,\r\nBithynia tentaculata, Cyclas cornea; and Mr. Prestwich mentions Cyclas\r\namnica and fragments of a Unio, besides several land shells. In the\r\nblack peaty mass Number 5, fragments of wood of the oak, yew, and fir\r\nhave been recognised. The flint weapons which I have seen from Hoxne are\r\nso much more perfect, and have their cutting edge so much sharper than\r\nthose from the valley of the Somme, that they seem neither to have been\r\nused by Man, nor to have been rolled in the bed of a river. The opinion\r\nof Mr. Frere, therefore, that there may have been a manufactory of\r\nweapons on the spot, appears probable.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLINT IMPLEMENTS AT ICKLINGHAM IN SUFFOLK.\r\n\r\nIn another part of Suffolk, at Icklingham, in the valley of the Lark,\r\nbelow Bury St. Edmund's, there is a bed of gravel, in which teeth of\r\nElephas primigenius and several flint tools, chiefly of a lance-head\r\nform, have been found. I have twice visited the spot, which has been\r\ncorrectly described by Mr. Prestwich.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 17\r\n     1861, page 364.)\r\n\r\nThe section of the Bedford tool-bearing alluvium, given in Figure 23,\r\nmay serve to illustrate that of Icklingham, if we substitute Chalk for\r\nOolite, and the river Lark for the Ouse. In both cases, the present bed\r\nof the river is about 30 feet below the level of the old gravel, and the\r\nChalk hill, which bounds the valley of the Lark on the right side, is\r\ncapped like the Oolite of Biddenham by boulder clay, which rises to\r\nthe height of 100 feet above the Lark. About twelve years ago, a large\r\nerratic block, above 4 feet in diameter, was dug out of the boulder\r\nclay at Icklingham, which I found to consist of a hard siliceous schist,\r\nwhich must have come from a remote region. The tool-bearing gravel here,\r\nas in the case to which it has been compared near Bedford, is proved\r\nto be newer than the glacial drift, by containing pebbles of basalt and\r\nother rocks derived from that formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. -- CAVERN DEPOSITS, AND PLACES OF SEPULTURE OF THE\r\nPLEISTOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\n   Flint Implements in Cave containing Hyaena and other extinct\r\n      Mammalia in Somersetshire.\r\n   Caves of the Gower Peninsula in South Wales.\r\n   Rhinoceros hemitoechus.\r\n   Ossiferous Caves near Palermo.\r\n   Sicily once part of Africa.\r\n   Rise of Bed of the Mediterranean to the Height of three hundred\r\n      Feet in the Human Period in Sardinia.\r\n   Burial-place of Pleistocene Date of Aurignac in the South of France.\r\n   Rhinoceros tichorhinus eaten by Man.\r\n   M. Lartet on extinct Mammalia and Works of Art found in the\r\n      Aurignac Cave.\r\n   Relative Antiquity of the same considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS OF ART ASSOCIATED WITH EXTINCT MAMMALIA IN A CAVERN IN\r\nSOMERSETSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe only British cave from which implements resembling those of Amiens\r\nhave been obtained, since the attention of geologists has been awakened\r\nto the importance of minutely observing the position of such relics\r\nrelatively to the associated fossil mammalia, is that recently opened\r\nnear Wells in Somersetshire. It occurs near the cave of Wookey Hole,\r\nfrom the mouth of which the river Axe issues on the southern flanks of\r\nthe Mendips. No one had suspected that on the left side of the ravine,\r\nthrough which the river flows after escaping from its subterranean\r\nchannel, there were other caves and fissures concealed beneath the green\r\nsward of the steep sloping bank. About ten years ago, a canal was made,\r\nseveral hundred yards in length, for the purpose of leading the waters\r\nof the Axe to a paper-mill, now occupying the middle of the ravine. In\r\ncarrying out this work, about 12 feet of the left bank was cut away,\r\nand a cavernous fissure, choked up to the roof with ossiferous loam, was\r\nthen, for the first time, exposed to view. This great cavity, originally\r\n9 feet high and 36 wide, traversed the Dolomitic Conglomerate; and\r\nfragments of that rock, some angular and others water-worn, were\r\nscattered through the red mud of the cave, in which fossil remains were\r\nabundant. For an account of them and the position they occupied we are\r\nindebted to Mr. Dawkins, F.G.S., who, in company with Mr. Williamson,\r\nexplored the cavern in 1859, and obtained from it the bones of the\r\nHyaena spelaea in such numbers as to lead him to conclude that the\r\ncavern had for a long time been a hyaena's den. Among the accompanying\r\nanimals found fossil in the same bone-earth, were observed Elephas\r\nprimigenius, Rhinoceros tichorhinus, Ursus spelaeus, Bos primigenius,\r\nMegaceros hibernicus, Cervus tarandus (and other species of Cervus),\r\nFelis spelaea, Canis lupus, Canis vulpes, and teeth and bones of the\r\ngenus Equus in great numbers.\r\n\r\nIntermixed with the above fossil bones were some arrowheads, made of\r\nbone, and many chipped flints, and chipped pieces of chert, a white or\r\nbleached flint weapon of the spearhead Amiens type, which was taken out\r\nof the undisturbed matrix by Mr. Williamson himself, together with a\r\nhyaena's tooth, showing that Man had either been contemporaneous with\r\nor had preceded the extinct fauna. After penetrating 34 feet from the\r\nentrance, Mr. Dawkins found the cave bifurcating into two branches, one\r\nof which was vertical. By this rent, perhaps, some part of the contents\r\nof the cave may have been introduced.*\r\n\r\n     (* Boyd Dawkins, \"Proceedings of the Geological Society\"\r\n     January 1862.)\r\n\r\nWhen I examined the spot in 1860, after I had been shown some remains of\r\nthe hyaena collected there, I felt convinced that a complete revolution\r\nmust have taken place in the topography of the district since the time\r\nof the extinct quadrupeds. I was not aware at the time that flint tools\r\nhad been met with in the same bone-deposit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAVES OF GOWER IN GLAMORGANSHIRE, SOUTH WALES.\r\n\r\nThe ossiferous caves of the peninsula of Gower in Glamorganshire\r\nhave been diligently explored of late years by Dr. Falconer and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel E.R. Wood, who have thoroughly investigated the\r\ncontents of many which were previously unknown. Among these Dr.\r\nFalconer's skilled eye has recognised the remains of almost every\r\nquadruped which he had elsewhere found fossil in British caves: in some\r\nplaces the Elephas primigenius, accompanied by its usual companion,\r\nthe Rhinoceros tichorhinus, in others Elephas antiquus, associated\r\nwith Rhinoceros hemitoechus, Falconer; the extinct animals being often\r\nembedded, as in the Belgian caves, in the same matrix with species now\r\nliving in Europe, such as the common badger (Meles taxus), the common\r\nwolf, and the fox.\r\n\r\nIn a cavernous fissure called the Raven's Cliff, teeth of several\r\nindividuals of Hippopotamus major, both young and old, were found; and\r\nthis in a district where there is now scarce a rill of running water,\r\nmuch less a river in which such quadrupeds could swim. In one of the\r\ncaves, called Spritsail Tor, bones of the elephants above named were\r\nobserved, with a great many other quadrupeds of Recent and extinct\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nFrom one fissure, called Bosco's Den, no less than one thousand antlers\r\nof the reindeer, chiefly of the variety called Cervus Guettardi, were\r\nextracted by the persevering exertions of Colonel Wood, who estimated\r\nthat several hundred more still remained in the bone-earth of the same\r\nrent.\r\n\r\nThey were mostly shed horns, and of young animals; and had been washed\r\ninto the rent with other bones, and with angular fragments of limestone,\r\nand all enveloped in the same ochreous mud. Among the other bones, which\r\nwere not numerous, were those of the cave-bear, wolf, fox, ox, stag, and\r\nfield-mouse.\r\n\r\nBut the discovery of most importance, as bearing on the subject of the\r\npresent work, is the occurrence in a newly-discovered cave, called\r\nLong Hole, by Colonel Wood, in 1861, of the remains of two species\r\nof rhinoceros, R. tichorhinus and R. hemitoechus, Falconer, in an\r\nundisturbed deposit, in the lower part of which were some well-shaped\r\nflint knives, evidently of human workmanship. It is clear from their\r\nposition that Man was coeval with these two species. We have elsewhere\r\nindependent proofs of his co-existence with every other species of the\r\ncave-fauna of Glamorganshire; but this is the first well-authenticated\r\nexample of the occurrence of R. hemitoechus in connection with human\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\nIn the fossil fauna of the valley of the Thames, Rhinoceros leptorhinus\r\nwas mentioned as occurring at Gray's Thurrock with Elephas antiquus.\r\nDr. Falconer, in a memoir which he is now preparing for the press on the\r\nEuropean Pliocene and Pleistocene species of the genus Rhinoceros,\r\nhas shown that, under the above name of R. leptorhinus, three\r\ndistinct species have been confounded by Cuvier, Owen, and other\r\npalaeontologists:--\r\n\r\n1. R. megarhinus, Christol, being the original and typical R.\r\nleptorhinus of Cuvier, founded on Cortesi's Monte Zago cranium, and the\r\nONLY Pliocene, or Pleistocene European species, that had not a nasal\r\nseptum.--Gray's Thurrock, etc.\r\n\r\n2. R. hemitoechus, Falconer, in which the ossification of the septum\r\ndividing the nostrils is incomplete in the middle, besides other cranial\r\nand dental characters distinguishing it from R. tichorhinus, accompanies\r\nElephas antiquus in most of the oldest British bone-caves, such\r\nas Kirkdale, Cefn, Durdham Down, Minchin Hole, and other Gower\r\ncaverns--also found at Clacton, in Essex, and in Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\n3. R. etruscus, Falconer, a comparatively slight and slender form, also\r\nwith an incomplete bony septum,* occurs deep in the Val d'Arno deposits,\r\nand in the \"Forest bed,\" and superimposed blue clays, with lignite, of\r\nthe Norfolk coast, but nowhere as yet found in the ossiferous caves in\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n     (* Falconer, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\"\r\n     volume 15 1859 page 602.)\r\n\r\nDr. Falconer announced in 1860 his opinion that the filling up of the\r\nGower caves in South Wales took place after the deposition of the marine\r\nboulder clay,* an opinion in harmony with what we have since learnt from\r\nthe section of the gravels near Bedford, given above (Figure 23), where\r\na fauna corresponding to that of the Welsh caves characterises the\r\nancient alluvium, and is shown to be clearly post-glacial, in the sense\r\nof being posterior in date to the boulder-clay of the midland counties.\r\n\r\n     (* Ibid. volume 16 1860 page 491.)\r\n\r\nIn the same sense the late Edward Forbes declared, in 1846, his\r\nconviction that not only the Cervus megaceros, but also the mammoth\r\nand other extinct pachyderms and carnivora, had lived in Britain in\r\npost-glacial times.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Memoir of the Geological Survey\" pages 394 to 397.)\r\n\r\nThe Gower caves in general have their floors strewed over with sand,\r\ncontaining marine shells, all of living species; and there are raised\r\nbeaches on the adjoining coast, and other geological signs of great\r\nalteration in the relative level of land and sea, since that country was\r\ninhabited by the extinct mammalia, some of which, as we have seen, were\r\ncertainly coeval with Man.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSSIFEROUS CAVES IN THE NORTH OF SICILY.\r\n\r\nGeologists have long been familiar with the fact that on the northern\r\ncoast of Sicily, between Termini on the east, and Trapani on the west,\r\nthere are several caves containing the bones of extinct animals. These\r\ncaves are situated in rocks of Hippurite limestone, a member of the\r\nCretaceous series, and some of them may be seen on both sides of the Bay\r\nof Palermo. If in the neighbourhood of that city we proceed from the\r\nsea inland, ascending a sloping terrace, composed of the marine Newer\r\nPliocene strata, we reach about a mile from the shore, and at the height\r\nof about 180 feet above it a precipice of limestone, at the base of\r\nwhich appear the entrances of several caves. In that of San Ciro, on\r\nthe east side of the bay, we find at the bottom sand with marine shells,\r\nforty species of which have been examined, and found almost all to agree\r\nspecifically with mollusca now inhabiting the Mediterranean. Higher in\r\nposition, and resting on the sand, is a breccia, composed of pieces of\r\nlimestone, quartz, and schist in a matrix of brown marl, through\r\nwhich land shells are dispersed, together with bones of two species\r\nof hippopotamus, as determined by Dr. Falconer. Certain bones of the\r\nskeleton were counted in such numbers as to prove that they must have\r\nbelonged to several hundred individuals. With these were associated the\r\nremains of Elephas antiquus, and bones of the genera Bos, Cervus, Sus,\r\nUrsus, Canis, and a large Felis. Some of these bones have been rolled\r\nas if partially subjected to the action of water, and may have been\r\nintroduced by streams through rents in the Hippurite limestone; but\r\nthere is now no running water in the neighbourhood, no river such as\r\nthe hippopotamus might frequent, not even a small brook, so that the\r\nphysical geography of the district must have been altogether changed\r\nsince the time when such remains were swept into fissures, or into the\r\nchannels of engulfed rivers.\r\n\r\nNo proofs seem yet to have been found of the existence of Man at the\r\nperiod when the hippopotamus and Elephas antiquus flourished at San\r\nCiro. But there is another cave called the Grotto di Maccagnone, which\r\nmuch resembles it in geological position, on the opposite or west side\r\nof the Bay of Palermo, near Carini. In the bottom of this cave a bone\r\ndeposit like that of San Ciro occurs, and above it other materials\r\nreaching to the roof, and evidently washed in from above, through\r\ncrevices in the limestone. In this upper and newer breccia Dr. Falconer\r\ndiscovered flint knives, bone splinters, bits of charcoal, burnt clay,\r\nand other objects indicating human intervention, mingled with entire\r\nland shells, teeth of horses, coprolites of hyaenas, and other\r\nbones, the whole agglutinated to one another and to the roof by the\r\ninfiltration of water holding lime in solution. The perfect condition\r\nof the large fragile helices (Helix vermiculata) afforded satisfactory\r\nevidence, says Dr. Falconer, that the various articles were carried\r\ninto the cave by the tranquil agency of water, and not by any tumultuous\r\naction. At a subsequent period other geographical changes took place,\r\nso that the cave, after it had been filled, was washed out again, or\r\nemptied of its contents with the exception of those patches of breccia\r\nwhich, being cemented together by stalactite, still adhere to the roof.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 16\r\n     1860 page 105.)\r\n\r\nBaron Anca, following up these investigations, explored, in 1859,\r\nanother cave at Mondello, west of Palermo, and north of Mount Gallo,\r\nwhere he discovered molars of the living African elephant, and\r\nafterwards additional specimens of the same species in the neighbouring\r\ngrotto of Olivella. In reference to this elephant, Dr. Falconer has\r\nreminded us that the distance between the nearest part of Sicily and\r\nthe coast of Africa, between Marsala and Cape Bon, is not more than 80\r\nmiles, and Admiral Smyth, in his Memoir on the Mediterranean, states\r\n(page 499) that there is a subaqueous plateau, named by him Adventure\r\nBank, uniting Sicily to Africa by a succession of ridges which are not\r\nmore than from 40 to 50 fathoms under water.*\r\n\r\n     (* Cited by Horner, \"Presidential Address to the Geological\r\n     Society\" 1861 page 42.)\r\n\r\nSicily therefore might be re-united to Africa by movements of upheaval\r\nnot greater than those which are already known to have taken place\r\nwithin the human period on the borders of the Mediterranean, of which\r\nI shall now proceed to cite a well-authenticated example, observed in\r\nSardinia.\r\n\r\n\r\nRISE OF THE BED OF THE SEA TO THE HEIGHT OF 300 FEET, IN THE HUMAN\r\nPERIOD, IN SARDINIA.\r\n\r\nCount Albert de la Marmora, in his description of the geology of\r\nSardinia,* has shown that on the southern coast of that island, at\r\nCagliari and in the neighbourhood, an ancient bed of the sea, containing\r\nmarine shells of living species, and numerous fragments of antique\r\npottery, has been elevated to the height of from 230 to 324 feet above\r\nthe present level of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Partie Geologique\" volume 1 pages 382 and 387.)\r\n\r\nOysters and other shells, of which a careful list has been published,\r\nincluding the common mussel (Mytilus edulis), many of them having\r\nboth valves united, occur, embedded in a breccia in which fragments of\r\nlimestone abound. The mussels are often in such numbers as to impart,\r\nwhen they have decomposed, a violet colour to the marine stratum.\r\nBesides pieces of coarse pottery, a flattened ball of baked earthenware,\r\nwith a hole through its axis, was found in the midst of the marine\r\nshells. It is supposed to have been used for weighting a fishing net. Of\r\nthis and of one of the fragments of ancient pottery Count de la Marmora\r\nhas given figures.\r\n\r\nThe upraised bed of the sea probably belongs in this instance to the\r\nPleistocene period, for in a bone breccia, filling fissures in the rocks\r\naround Cagliari, the remains of extinct mammalia have been detected;\r\namong which is a new genus of carnivorous quadruped, named Cynotherium\r\nby M. Studiati, and figured by Count de la Marmora in his Atlas (Plate\r\n7), also an extinct species of Lagomys, determined by Cuvier in 1825.\r\nEmbedded in the same bone-breccia, and enveloped with red earth like\r\nthe mammalian remains, were detected shells of the Mytilus edulis before\r\nmentioned, implying that the marine formation containing shells and\r\npottery had been already upheaved and exposed to denudation before the\r\nremains of quadrupeds were washed into these rents and included in the\r\nred earth. In the vegetable soil covering the upraised marine stratum,\r\nfragments of Roman pottery occur.\r\n\r\nIf we assume the average rate of upheaval to have been, as before\r\nhinted, 2 1/2 feet in a century, 300 feet would give an antiquity of\r\n12,000 years to the Cagliari pottery, even if we simply confine our\r\nestimate to the upheaval above the sea-level, without allowing for\r\nthe original depth of water in which the mollusca lived. Even then our\r\ncalculation would merely embrace the period during which the upward\r\nmovement was going on; and we can form at present no conjecture as to\r\nthe probable era of its commencement or termination.\r\n\r\nI learn from Captain Spratt, R.N., that the island of Crete or Candia,\r\nabout 135 miles in length, has been raised at its western extremity\r\nabout 25 feet; so that ancient ports are now high and dry above the sea,\r\nwhile at its eastern end it has sunk so much that the ruins of old towns\r\nare seen under water. Revolutions like these in the physical geography\r\nof the countries bordering the Mediterranean, may well help us to\r\nunderstand the phenomena of the Palermo caves, and the presence in\r\nSicily of African species of mammalia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE AND HABITS OF THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.\r\n\r\nAs I have alluded more than once in this chapter to the occurrence of\r\nthe remains of the hippopotamus in places where there are now no rivers,\r\nnot even a rill of water, and as other bones of the same genus have been\r\nmet with in the lower-level gravels of the Somme where large blocks\r\nof sandstone seem to imply that ice once played a part in their\r\ntransportation, it may be well to consider, before proceeding farther,\r\nwhat geographical and climatal conditions are indicated by the presence\r\nof these fossil pachyderms.\r\n\r\nIt is now very generally conceded that the mammoth and tichorhine\r\nrhinoceros were fitted to inhabit northern regions, and it is therefore\r\nnatural to begin by asking whether the extinct hippopotamus may not\r\nin like manner have flourished in a cold climate. In answer to this\r\ninquiry, it has been remarked that the living hippopotami, anatomically\r\nspeaking so closely allied to the extinct species, are so aquatic and\r\nfluviatile in their habits as to make it difficult to conceive that\r\ntheir congeners could have thriven all the year round in regions where,\r\nduring winter, the rivers were frozen over for months. Moreover, I have\r\nbeen unable to learn that, in any instance, bones of the hippopotamus\r\nhave been found in the drift of northern Germany associated with the\r\nremains of the mammoth, tichorhine rhinoceros, musk-ox, reindeer,\r\nlemming, and other arctic quadrupeds before alluded to; yet, though not\r\nproved to have ever made a part of such a fauna, the presence of the\r\nfossil hippopotamus north of the fiftieth parallel of latitude naturally\r\ntempts us to speculate on the migratory powers and instincts of some\r\nof the extinct species of the genus. They may have resembled, in this\r\nrespect, the living musk-ox, herds of which pass for hundreds of miles\r\nover the ice to the rich pastures of Melville Island, and then return\r\nagain to southern latitudes before the ice breaks up.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Sir Andrew Smith,* an experienced zoologist, for\r\nhaving given us an account of the migratory habits of the living\r\nhippopotamus of Southern Africa (H. amphibius, Linn.).\r\n\r\n     (* \"Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa\": article\r\n     \"Hippopotamus.\")\r\n\r\nHe states that, when the Dutch first colonised the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nthis animal abounded in all the great rivers, as far south as the\r\nland extends; whereas, in 1849, they had all disappeared, scarcely one\r\nremaining even within a moderate distance of the colony. He also tells\r\nus that this species evinces great sagacity in changing its quarters\r\nwhenever danger threatens, quitting every district invaded by settlers\r\nbearing fire-arms. Bulky as they are, they can travel speedily for miles\r\nover land from one pool of a dried-up river to another; but it is by\r\nwater that their powers of locomotion are surpassingly great, not only\r\nin rivers, but in the sea, for they are far from confining themselves to\r\nfresh water. Indeed, Sir A. Smith finds it \"difficult to decide whether,\r\nduring the daytime and when not feeding, they prefer the pools of rivers\r\nor the waters of the ocean for their abode.\" In districts where they\r\nhave been disturbed by Man, they feed almost entirely in the night,\r\nchiefly on certain kinds of grass, but also on brushwood. Sir A. Smith\r\nrelates that, in an expedition which he made north of Port Natal, he\r\nfound them swarming in all the rivers about the tropic of Capricorn.\r\nHere they were often seen to have left their footprints on the sands,\r\nentering or coming out of the salt water; and on one occasion Smith's\r\nparty tried in vain to intercept a female with her young as she was\r\nmaking her way to the sea. Another female, which they had wounded on her\r\nprecipitate retreat to the sea, was afterwards shot in that element.\r\n\r\nThe geologist, therefore, may freely speculate on the time when herds of\r\nhippopotami issued from North African rivers, such as the Nile, and\r\nswam northwards in summer along the coasts of the Mediterranean, or even\r\noccasionally visited islands near the shore. Here and there they\r\nmay have landed to graze or browse, tarrying awhile and afterwards\r\ncontinuing their course northwards. Others may have swum in a few summer\r\ndays from rivers in the south of Spain or France to the Somme, Thames,\r\nor Severn, making timely retreat to the south before the snow and ice\r\nset in.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURIAL-PLACE AT AURIGNAC, IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE, OF PLEISTOCENE DATE.\r\n\r\nI have alluded in the beginning of the fourth chapter to a custom\r\nprevalent among rude nations of consigning to the tomb works of art,\r\nonce the property of the dead, or objects of their affection, and even\r\nof storing up, in many cases, animal food destined for the manes of the\r\ndefunct in a future life. I also cited M. Desnoyers' comments on the\r\nabsence among the bones of wild and domestic animals found in old\r\nGaulish tombs of all intermixture of extinct species of quadrupeds, as\r\nproving that the oldest sepulchral monuments then known in France (1845)\r\nhad no claims to high antiquity founded on palaeontological data.\r\n\r\nM. Lartet, however, has recently published a circumstantial account of\r\nwhat seems clearly to have been a sepulchral vault of the Pleistocene\r\nperiod, near Aurignac, not far from the foot of the Pyrenees. I have had\r\nthe advantage of inspecting the fossil bones and works of art obtained\r\nby him from that grotto, and of conversing and corresponding with him\r\non the subject, and can see no grounds for doubting the soundness of his\r\nconclusions.*\r\n\r\n     (* See Lartet, \"Annales des Sci. Nat.\" 4mo. Ser. Zoologie\r\n     volume 15 page 177 translated in \"Natural History Review\"\r\n     London January 1862.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 25. Hill of Fajoles]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 25.

Nummulitic limestone of hill of Fajoles.)\r\n\r\nThe town of Aurignac is situated in the department of the Haute-Garonne,\r\nnear a spur of the Pyrenees; adjoining it is the small flat-topped hill\r\nof Fajoles, about 60 feet above the brook called Rodes, which flows at\r\nits foot on one side. It consists of Nummulitic limestone, presenting\r\na steep escarpment towards the north-west, on which side in the face of\r\nthe rock, about 45 feet above the brook, is now visible the entrance of\r\na grotto a, Figure 25, which opened originally on the terrace h, c, k,\r\nwhich slopes gently towards the valley.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1852, the opening into this grotto was masked by a talus\r\nof small fragments of limestone and earthy matter e, such as the rain\r\nmay have washed down the slope of the hill. In that year a labourer\r\nnamed Bonnemaison, employed in repairing the roads, observed that\r\nrabbits, when hotly pursued by the sportsman, ran into a hole which they\r\nhad burrowed in the talus, at i f, Figure 25. On reaching as far into\r\nthe opening as the length of his arm, he drew out, to his surprise,\r\none of the long bones of the human skeleton; and his curiosity being\r\nexcited, and having a suspicion that the hole communicated with a\r\nsubterranean cavity, he commenced digging a trench through the middle of\r\nthe talus, and in a few hours found himself opposite a large heavy slab\r\nof rock f h, placed vertically against the entrance. Having removed\r\nthis, he discovered on the other side of it an arched cavity a, 7 or 8\r\nfeet in its greatest height, 10 in width, and 7 in horizontal depth. It\r\nwas almost filled with bones, among which were two entire skulls, which\r\nhe recognised at once as human. The people of Aurignac, astonished to\r\nhear of the occurrence of so many human relics in so lonely a spot,\r\nflocked to the cave, and Dr. Amiel, the Mayor, ordered all the bones to\r\nbe taken out and reinterred in the parish cemetery. But before this was\r\ndone, having as a medical man a knowledge of anatomy, he ascertained\r\nby counting the homologous bones that they must have formed parts of no\r\nless than seventeen skeletons of both sexes, and all ages; some so young\r\nthat the ossification of some of the bones was incomplete. Unfortunately\r\nthe skulls were injured in the transfer; and what is worse, after the\r\nlapse of eight years, when M. Lartet visited Aurignac, the village\r\nsexton was unable to tell him in what exact place the trench was dug,\r\ninto which the skeletons had been thrown, so that this rich harvest\r\nof ethnological knowledge seems for ever lost to the antiquary and\r\ngeologist.\r\n\r\nM. Lartet having been shown, in 1860, the remains of some extinct\r\nanimals and works of art, found in digging the original trench made by\r\nBonnemaison through the bed d under the talus, and some others\r\nbrought out from the interior of the grotto, determined to investigate\r\nsystematically what remained intact of the deposits outside and inside\r\nthe vault, those inside, underlying the human skeletons, being supposed\r\nto consist entirely of made ground. Having obtained the assistance of\r\nsome intelligent workmen, he personally superintended their labours, and\r\nfound outside the grotto, resting on the sloping terrace h k, the layer\r\nof ashes and charcoal c, about 6 inches thick, extending over an area of\r\n6 or 7 square yards, and going as far as the entrance of the grotto and\r\nno farther, there being no cinders or charcoal in the interior. Among\r\nthe cinders outside the vault were fragments of fissile sandstone,\r\nreddened by heat, which were observed to rest on a levelled surface of\r\nNummulitic limestone and to have formed a hearth. The nearest place from\r\nwhence such slabs of sandstone could have been brought was the opposite\r\nside of the valley.\r\n\r\nAmong the ashes, and in some overlying earthy layers, d, separating the\r\nashes from the talus e, were a great variety of bones and implements;\r\namongst the latter not fewer than a hundred flint articles--knives,\r\nprojectiles, sling stones, and chips, and among them one of those\r\nsiliceous cores or nuclei with numerous facets, from which flint flakes\r\nor knives had been struck off, seeming to prove that some instruments\r\nwere occasionally manufactured on the very spot.\r\n\r\nAmong other articles outside the entrance was found a stone of a\r\ncircular form, and flattened on two sides, with a central depression,\r\ncomposed of a tough rock which does not belong to that region of the\r\nPyrenees. This instrument is supposed by the Danish antiquaries to have\r\nbeen used for removing by skilful blows the edges of flint knives, the\r\nfingers and thumb being placed in the two opposite depressions during\r\nthe operation. Among the bone instruments were arrows without barbs, and\r\nother tools made of reindeer horn, and a bodkin formed out of the\r\nmore compact horn of the roedeer. This instrument was well shaped, and\r\nsharply pointed, and in so good a state of preservation that it might\r\nstill be used for piercing the tough skins of animals.\r\n\r\nScattered through the same ashes and earth were the bones of the various\r\nspecies of animals enumerated in the subjoined lists, with the exception\r\nof two, marked with an asterisk, which only occurred in the interior of\r\nthe grotto:--\r\n\r\nTABLE 10/1.

Bison europaeus (aurochs): 12 to 15.\r\n\r\nThe bones of the herbivora were the most numerous, and all those on the\r\noutside of the grotto which had contained marrow were invariably split\r\nopen, as if for its extraction, many of them being also burnt. The\r\nspongy parts, moreover, were wanting, having been eaten off and gnawed\r\nafter they were broken, the work, according to M. Lartet, of hyaenas,\r\nthe bones and coprolites of which were mixed with the cinders, and\r\ndispersed through the overlying soil d. These beasts of prey are\r\nsupposed to have prowled about the spot and fed on such relics of the\r\nfuneral feasts as remained after the retreat of the human visitors,\r\nor during the intervals between successive funeral ceremonies which\r\naccompanied the interment of the corpses within the sepulchre. Many of\r\nthe bones were also streaked, as if the flesh had been scraped off by a\r\nflint instrument.\r\n\r\nAmong the various proofs that the bones were fresh when brought to the\r\nspot, it is remarked that those of the herbivora not only bore the marks\r\nof having had the marrow extracted and having afterwards been gnawed\r\nand in part devoured as if by carnivorous beasts, but that they had also\r\nbeen acted upon by fire (and this was especially noticed in one case of\r\na cave-bear's bone), in such a manner as to show that they retained in\r\nthem at the time all their animal matter.\r\n\r\nAmong other quadrupeds which appear to have been eaten at the funeral\r\nfeasts, and of which the bones occurred among the ashes, were those of a\r\nyoung Rhinoceros tichorhinus, the bones of which had been, like those of\r\nthe accompanying herbivora, broken and gnawed by a beast of prey at both\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\nOutside of the great slab of stone forming the door, not one human bone\r\noccurred; inside of it there were found, mixed with loose soil, the\r\nremains of as many as seventeen human individuals, besides some works\r\nof art and bones of animals. We know nothing of the arrangement of these\r\nbones when they were first broken into. M. Lartet inferred at first that\r\nthe bodies were bent down upon themselves in a squatting attitude,\r\na posture known to have been adopted in most of the sepulchres of\r\nprimitive times; and he has so represented them in his restoration of\r\nthe cave: but this opinion he has since retracted. His artist also has\r\ninadvertently, in the same drawing, delineated the arched grotto as if\r\nit were shaped very regularly and smoothly, like a finished piece of\r\nmasonry, whereas the surface was in truth as uneven and irregular as are\r\nthe roofs of all natural grottos.\r\n\r\nThere was no stalagmite in the grotto, and M. Lartet, an experienced\r\ninvestigator of ossiferous caverns in the south of France, came to\r\nthe conclusion that all the bones and soil found in the inside were\r\nartificially introduced. The substratum b, Figure 25, which remained\r\nafter the skeletons had been removed, was about 2 feet thick. In it were\r\nfound about ten detached human bones, including a molar tooth; and M.\r\nDelesse ascertained by careful analysis of one of these, as well as of\r\nthe bones of a rhinoceros, bear, and some other extinct animals, that\r\nthey all contained precisely the same proportion of nitrogen, or had\r\nlost an equal amount of their animal matter. My friend Mr. Evans, before\r\ncited, has suggested to me that such a fact, taken alone, may not be\r\nconclusive in favour of the equal antiquity of the human and other\r\nremains. No doubt, had the human skeletons been found to contain more\r\ngelatine than those of the extinct mammalia, it would have shown that\r\nthey were the more modern of the two; but it is possible that after a\r\nbone has gone on losing its animal matter up to a certain point, it may\r\nthen part with no more so long as it continues enveloped in the same\r\nmatrix. If this be so, it follows that bones of very different degrees\r\nof antiquity, after they have lain for many thousands of years in\r\na particular soil, may all have reached long ago the maximum of\r\ndecomposition attainable in such a matrix. In the present case, however,\r\nthe proof of the contemporaneousness of Man and the extinct animals\r\ndoes not depend simply on the identity of their mineral condition. The\r\nchemical analysis of M. Delesse is only a fact in corroboration of a\r\ngreat mass of other evidence.\r\n\r\nMixed with the human bones inside the grotto first removed by\r\nBonnemaison, were eighteen small, round, and flat plates of a white\r\nshelly substance, made of some species of cockle (Cardium), pierced\r\nthrough the middle as if for being strung into a bracelet. In the\r\nsubstratum also in the interior examined by M. Lartet was found the tusk\r\nof a young Ursus spelaeus, the crown of which had been stripped of its\r\nenamel, and which had been carved perhaps in imitation of the head of a\r\nbird. It was perforated lengthwise as if for suspension as an ornament\r\nor amulet. A flint knife also was found in the interior which had\r\nevidently never been used; in this respect, unlike the numerous worn\r\nspecimens found outside, so that it is conjectured that it may, like\r\nother associated works of art, have been placed there as part of the\r\nfuneral ceremonies.\r\n\r\nA few teeth of the cave-lion, Felis spelaea, and two tusks of the wild\r\nboar, also found in the interior, were memorials perhaps of the chase.\r\nNo remains of the same animals were met with among the external relics.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the bones of animals inside the vault offer a remarkable\r\ncontrast to those of the exterior, being all entire and uninjured, none\r\nof them broken, gnawed, half-eaten, scraped, or burnt like those lying\r\namong the ashes on the other side of the great slab which formed the\r\nportal. The bones of the interior seem to have been clothed with their\r\nflesh when buried in the layer of loose soil strewed over the floor.\r\nIn confirmation of this idea, many bones of the skeleton were often\r\nobserved to be in juxtaposition, and in one spot all the bones of the\r\nleg of an Ursus spelaeus were lying together uninjured. Add to this,\r\nthe entire absence in the interior of cinders and charcoal, and we\r\ncan scarcely doubt that we have here an example of an ancient place of\r\nsepulture, closed at the opening so effectually against the hyaenas or\r\nother carnivora that no marks of their teeth appear on any of the bones,\r\nwhether human or brute.\r\n\r\nJohn Carver, in his travels in the interior of North America in a\r\n1766-68 (chapter 15.), gave a minute account of the funeral rites of\r\nan Indian tribe which inhabited the country now called Iowa, at the\r\njunction of the St. Peter's River with the Mississippi; and Schiller,\r\nin his famous \"Nadowessische Todtenklage,\" has faithfully embodied in\r\na poetic dirge all the characteristic features of the ceremonies so\r\ngraphically described by the English traveller, not omitting the many\r\nfuneral gifts which, we are told, were placed \"in a cave\" with the\r\nbodies of the dead. The lines beginning, \"Bringet her die letzten\r\nGaben,\" have been thus translated, truthfully, and with all the spirit\r\nof the original, by Sir E. L. Bulwer*:--\r\n\r\n     \"Here bring the last gifts!--and with these\r\n     The last lament be said;\r\n     Let all that pleased, and yet may please,\r\n     Be buried with the dead.\r\n\r\n     \"Beneath his head the hatchet hide,\r\n     That he so stoutly swung;\r\n     And place the bear's fat haunch beside--\r\n     The journey hence is long!\r\n\r\n     \"And let the knife new sharpened be\r\n     That on the battle-day\r\n     Shore with quick strokes--he took but three--\r\n     The foeman's scalp away!\r\n\r\n     \"The paints that warriors love to use,\r\n     Place here within his hand,\r\n     That he may shine with ruddy hues\r\n     Amidst the spirit-land.\"\r\n\r\n     (* \"Poems and Ballads of Schiller.\")\r\n\r\nIf we accept M. Lartet's interpretation of the ossiferous deposits of\r\nAurignac, both inside and outside the grotto, they add nothing to the\r\npalaeontological evidence in favour of Man's antiquity, for we have seen\r\nall the same mammalia associated elsewhere with flint implements, and\r\nsome species, such as the Elephas antiquus, Rhinoceros hemitoechus, and\r\nHippopotamus major, missing here, have been met with in other places. An\r\nargument, however, having an opposite leaning may perhaps be founded on\r\nthe phenomena of Aurignac. It may--indeed it has been said, that they\r\nimply that some of the extinct mammalia survived nearly to our times:\r\n\r\nFirst--Because of the modern style of the works of art at Aurignac.\r\n\r\nSecondly--Because of the absence of any signs of change in the physical\r\ngeography of the country since the cave was used for a place of\r\nsepulture.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the first of these propositions, the utensils, it is\r\nsaid, of bone and stone indicate a more advanced state of the arts than\r\nthe flint implements of Abbeville and Amiens. M. Lartet, however, is\r\nof opinion that they do not, and thinks that we have no right to assume\r\nthat the fabricators of the various spear-headed and other tools of\r\nthe Valley of the Somme possessed no bone instruments or ornaments\r\nresembling those discovered at Aurignac. These last, moreover, he\r\nregards as extremely rude in comparison with others of the stone period\r\nin France, which can be proved palaeontologically, at least by strong\r\nnegative evidence, to be of subsequent date. Thus, for example, at\r\nSavigne, near Civray, in the department of Vienne, there is a cave in\r\nwhich there are no extinct mammalia, but where remains of the reindeer\r\nabound. The works of art of the stone period found there indicate\r\nconsiderable progress in skill beyond that attested by the objects found\r\nin the Aurignac grotto. Among the Savigne articles, there is the bone of\r\na stag, on which figures of two animals, apparently meant for deer, are\r\nengraved in outline, as if by a sharp-pointed flint. In another cave,\r\nthat of Massat, in the department of Ariege, which M. Lartet ascribes\r\nto the period of the aurochs, a quadruped which survived the reindeer in\r\nthe south of France, there are bone instruments of a still more advanced\r\nstate of the arts, as, for example, barbed arrows with a small canal in\r\neach, believed to have served for the insertion of poison; also a needle\r\nof bird's bone, finely shaped, with an eye or perforation at one end,\r\nand a stag's horn, on which is carved a representation of a bear's head,\r\nand a hole at one end as if for suspending it. In this figure we see,\r\nsays M. Lartet, what may perhaps be the earliest known example of lines\r\nused to express shading.\r\n\r\nThe fauna of the aurochs (Bison europaeus) agrees with that of the\r\nearlier lake dwellings in Switzerland, in which hitherto the reindeer\r\nis wanting; whereas the reindeer has been found in a Swiss cave, in Mont\r\nSaleve, supposed by Lartet to be more ancient than the lake dwellings.\r\n\r\nAccording to this view, the mammalian fauna has undergone at least two\r\nfluctuations since the remains of some extinct quadrupeds were eaten,\r\nand others buried as funeral gifts in the sepulchral vault of Aurignac.\r\n\r\nAs to the absence of any marked changes in the physical configuration\r\nof the district since the same grotto was a place of sepulture, we\r\nmust remember that it is the normal state of the earth's surface to be\r\nundergoing great alterations in one place, while other areas, often\r\nin close proximity, remain for ages without any modification. In one\r\nregion, rivers are deepening and widening their channels, or the waves\r\nof the sea are undermining cliffs, or the land is sinking beneath\r\nor rising above the waters, century after century, or the volcano is\r\npouring forth torrents of lava or showers of ashes; while, in tracts\r\nhard by, the ancient forest, or extensive heath, or the splendid city\r\ncontinue scatheless and motionless. Had the talus which concealed from\r\nview the ancient hearth with its cinders and the massive stone portal\r\nof the Aurignac grotto escaped all human interference for thousands of\r\nyears to come, there is no reason to suppose that the small stream at\r\nthe foot of the hill of Fajoles would have undermined it. At the end of\r\na long period the only alteration might have been the thickening of the\r\ntalus which protected the loose cinders and bones from waste. We behold\r\nin many a valley of Auvergne, within 50 feet of the present river\r\nchannel, a volcanic cone of loose ashes, with a crater at its summit,\r\nfrom which powerful currents of basaltic lava have poured, usurping the\r\nancient bed of the torrent. By the action of the stream, in the course\r\nof ages, vast masses of the hard columnar basalt have been removed,\r\npillar after pillar, and much vesicular lava, as in the case, for\r\nexample, of the Puy Rouge, near Chalucet, and of the Puy de Tartaret,\r\nnear Nechers.*\r\n\r\n     (* Scrope's \"Volcanoes of Central France\" 1858 page 97.)\r\n\r\nThe rivers have even in some cases, as the Sioule, near Chalucet, cut\r\nthrough not only the basalt which dispossessed them of their ancient\r\nchannels, but have actually eaten 50 feet into the subjacent gneiss; yet\r\nthe cone, an incoherent heap of scoriae and spongy ejectamenta, stands\r\nunmolested. Had the waters once risen, even for a day, so high as to\r\nreach the level of the base of one of these cones--had there been a\r\nsingle flood 50 or 60 feet in height since the last eruption occurred,\r\na great part of these volcanoes must inevitably have been swept away\r\nas readily as all traces of the layer of cinders; and the accompanying\r\nbones would have been obliterated by the Rodes near Aurignac, had it\r\nrisen, since the days of the mammoth, rhinoceros, and cave-bear, 50 feet\r\nabove its present level.\r\n\r\nThe Aurignac cave adds no new species to the list of extinct quadrupeds,\r\nwhich we have elsewhere, and by independent evidence, ascertained to\r\nhave once flourished contemporaneously with Man. But if the fossil\r\nmemorials have been correctly interpreted--if we have here before us at\r\nthe northern base of the Pyrenees a sepulchral vault with skeletons\r\nof human beings, consigned by friends and relatives to their last\r\nresting-place--if we have also at the portal of the tomb the relics of\r\nfuneral feasts, and within it indications of viands destined for the\r\nuse of the departed on their way to a land of spirits; while among\r\nthe funeral gifts are weapons wherewith in other fields to chase the\r\ngigantic deer, the cave-lion, the cave-bear, and woolly rhinoceros--we\r\nhave at last succeeded in tracing back the sacred rites of burial,\r\nand, more interesting still, a belief in a future state, to times long\r\nanterior to those of history and tradition. Rude and superstitious\r\nas may have been the savage of that remote era, he still deserved, by\r\ncherishing hopes of a hereafter, the epithet of \"noble,\" which Dryden\r\ngave to what he seems to have pictured to himself as the primitive\r\ncondition of our race,\r\n\r\n     \"as Nature first made Man\r\n     When wild in woods the noble savage ran.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Siege of Granada\" Part 1 Act 1 Scene 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. -- AGE OF HUMAN FOSSILS OF LE PUY IN CENTRAL FRANCE AND OF\r\nNATCHEZ ON THE MISSISSIPPI DISCUSSED.\r\n\r\n     Question as to the Authenticity of the Fossil Man of Denise,\r\n        near Le Puy-en-Velay, considered.\r\n     Antiquity of the Human Race implied by that Fossil.\r\n     Successive Periods of Volcanic Action in Central France.\r\n     With what Changes in the Mammalian Fauna they correspond.\r\n     The Elephas meridionalis anterior in Time to the Implement-bearing\r\n        Gravel of St. Acheul.\r\n     Authenticity of the Human Fossil of Natchez on the Mississippi\r\n        discussed.\r\n     The Natchez Deposit, containing Bones of Mastodon and Megalonyx,\r\n        probably not older than the Flint Implements of St. Acheul.\r\n\r\nAmong the fossil remains of the human species supposed to have claims to\r\nhigh antiquity, and which have for many years attracted attention, two\r\nof the most prominent examples are:--\r\n\r\nFirst--\"The fossil man of Denise,\" comprising the remains of more\r\nthan one skeleton, found in a volcanic breccia near the town of Le\r\nPuy-en-Velay, in Central France.\r\n\r\nSecondly--The fossil human bone of Natchez, on the Mississippi, supposed\r\nto have been derived from a deposit containing remains of Mastodon\r\nand Megalonyx. Having carefully examined the sites of both of these\r\ncelebrated fossils, I shall consider in this chapter the nature of the\r\nevidence on which the remote date of their entombment is inferred.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL MAN OF DENISE.\r\n\r\nAn account of the fossil remains, so called, was first published in 1844\r\nby M. Aymard of Le Puy, a writer of deservedly high authority both as a\r\npalaeontologist and archaeologist.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Bulletin de la Societe Geologique de France\" 1844, 1845,\r\n     1847.)\r\n\r\nM. Pictet, after visiting Le Puy and investigating the site of the\r\nalleged discovery, was satisfied that the fossil bones belonged to the\r\nperiod of the last volcanic eruptions of Velay; but expressly stated in\r\nhis important treatise on palaeontology that this conclusion, though it\r\nmight imply that Man had co-existed with the extinct elephant, did not\r\ndraw with it the admission that the human race was anterior in date\r\nto the filling of the caverns of France and Belgium with the bones of\r\nextinct mammalia.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Traite de Paleontologie\" volume 1 1853 page 152.)\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the \"Scientific Congress\" of France, held at Le Puy in\r\n1856, the question of the age of the Denise fossil bones was fully gone\r\ninto, and in the report of their proceedings published in that year, the\r\nopinions of some of the most skilful osteologists respecting the point\r\nin controversy are recorded. The late Abbe Croizet, a most experienced\r\ncollector of fossil bones in the volcanic regions of Central France, and\r\nan able naturalist, and the late M. Laurillard, of Paris, who assisted\r\nCuvier in modelling many fossil bones, and in the arrangement of the\r\nmuseum of the Jardin, declared their opinion that the specimen preserved\r\nin the museum of Le Puy is no counterfeit. They believed the human bones\r\nto have been enveloped by natural causes in the tufaceous matrix in\r\nwhich we now see them.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1859, Professor Hebert and M. Lartet visited Le Puy,\r\nexpressly to investigate the same specimen, and to inquire into the\r\nauthenticity of the bones and their geological age. Later in the same\r\nyear, I went myself to Le Puy, having the same object in view, and had\r\nthe good fortune to meet there my friend Mr. Poulett Scrope, with whom\r\nI examined the Montagne de Denise, where a peasant related to us how he\r\nhad dug out the specimen with his own hands and in his own vineyard, not\r\nfar from the summit of the volcano. I employed a labourer to make under\r\nhis directions some fresh excavations, following up those which had been\r\nmade a month earlier by MM. Hebert and Lartet, in the hope of verifying\r\nthe true position of the fossils, but all of us without success. We\r\nfailed even to find in situ any exact counterpart of the stone of the Le\r\nPuy Museum.\r\n\r\nThe osseous remains of that specimen consist of a frontal and some other\r\nparts of the skull, including the upper jaw with teeth, both of an adult\r\nand young individual; also a radius, some lumbar vertebrae, and\r\nsome metatarsal bones. They are all embedded in a light porous tuff,\r\nresembling in colour and mineral composition the ejectamenta of several\r\nof the latest eruptions of Denise. But none of the bones penetrate into\r\nanother part of the same specimen, which consists of a more compact rock\r\nthickly laminated. Nevertheless, I agree with the Abbe Croizet and M.\r\nAymard, that it is not conceivable even that the less coherent part of\r\nthe museum Specimen which envelopes the human bones should have been\r\nartificially put together, whatever may have been the origin of certain\r\nother slabs of tuff which were afterwards sold as coming from the same\r\nplace, and which also contained human remains. Whether some of these\r\nwere spurious or not is a question more difficult to decide. One of\r\nthem, now in the possession of M. Pichot-Dumazel, an advocate of Le Puy,\r\nis suspected of having had some plaster of Paris introduced into it to\r\nbind the bones more firmly together in the loose volcanic tuff. I was\r\nassured that a dealer in objects of natural history at Le Puy had been\r\nin the habit of occasionally securing the cohesion in that manner of\r\nfragments of broken bones, and the juxtaposition of uninjured ones\r\nfound free and detachable in loose volcanic tuffs. From this to the\r\nfabrication of a factitious human fossil was, it is suggested, but\r\na short step. But in reference to M. Pichot's specimen, an expert\r\nanatomist remarked to me that it would far exceed the skill, whether of\r\nthe peasant who owned the vineyard or of the dealer above mentioned, to\r\nput together in their true position all the thirty-eight bones of\r\nthe hand and fingers, or the sixteen of the wrist, without making any\r\nmistake, and especially without mixing those of the right with the\r\nhomologous bones of the left hand, assuming that they had brought bones,\r\nfrom some other spot, and then artificially introduced them into a\r\nmixture of volcanic tuff and plaster of Paris.\r\n\r\nGranting, however, that the high prices given for \"human fossils\" at\r\nLe Puy may have led to the perpetration of some frauds, it is still\r\nan interesting question to consider whether the admission of the\r\ngenuineness of a single fossil, such as that now in the museum at Le\r\nPuy, would lead us to assign a higher antiquity to the existence of Man\r\nin France than is deducible from many other facts explained in the last\r\nseven chapters. In reference to this point, I may observe that although\r\nI was not able to fix with precision the exact bed in the volcanic\r\nmountain from which the rock containing the human bones was taken, M.\r\nFelix Robert has, nevertheless, after studying \"the volcanic alluviums\"\r\nof Denise, ascertained that, on the side of Cheyrac and the village of\r\nMalouteyre, blocks of tuff frequently occur exactly like the one in the\r\nmuseum. That tuff he considers a product of the latest eruption of\r\nthe volcano. In it have been found the remains of Hyaena spelaea and\r\nHippopotamus major. The eruptions of steam and gaseous matter which\r\nburst forth from the crater of Denise broke through laminated Tertiary\r\nclays, small pieces of which, some of them scarcely altered, others half\r\nconverted into scoriae, were cast out in abundance, while other portions\r\nmust have been in a state of argillaceous mud. Showers of such materials\r\nwould be styled by the Neapolitans \"aqueous lava\" or \"lava d'aqua,\" and\r\nwe may well suppose that some human individuals, if any existed, would,\r\ntogether with wild animals, be occasionally overwhelmed in these tuffs.\r\nFrom near the place on the mountain whence the block with human bones\r\nnow in the museum is said to have come, a stream of lava, well marked by\r\nits tabular structure, flowed down the flanks of the hill, within a few\r\nfeet of the alluvial plain of the Borne, a small tributary of the Loire,\r\non the opposite bank of which stands the town of Le Puy. Its continuous\r\nextension to so low a level clearly shows that the valley had already\r\nbeen deepened to within a few feet of its present depth at the time of\r\nthe flowing of the lava.\r\n\r\nWe know that the alluvium of the same district, having a similar\r\nrelation to the present geographical outline of the valleys, is of\r\nPleistocene date, for it contains around Le Puy the bones of Elephas\r\nprimigenius and Rhinoceros tichorhinus; and this affords us a\r\npalaeontological test of the age of the human skeleton of Denise, if the\r\nlatter be assumed to be coeval with the lava stream above referred to.\r\n\r\nIt is important to dwell on this point, because some geologists have\r\nfelt disinclined to believe in the genuineness of the \"fossil man of\r\nDenise,\" on the ground that, if conceded, it would imply that the\r\nhuman race was contemporary with an older fauna, or that of the Elephas\r\nmeridionalis. Such a fauna is found fossil in another layer of tuff\r\ncovering the slope of Denise, opposite to that where the museum specimen\r\nwas exhumed. The quadrupeds obtained from that more ancient tuff\r\ncomprise Elephas meridionalis, Hippopotamus major, Rhinoceros\r\nmegarhinus, Antilope torticornis, Hyaena brevirostris, and twelve others\r\nof the genera horse, ox, stag, goat, tiger, etc., all supposed to be of\r\nextinct species. This tuff, found between Malouteyre and Polignac, M.\r\nRobert regards as the product of a much older eruption, and referable to\r\nthe neighbouring Montagne de St. Anne, a volcano in a much more wasted\r\nand denuded state than Denise, and classed by M. Bertrand de Doue as of\r\nintermediate age between the ancient and modern cones of Velay.\r\n\r\nThe fauna to which Elephas meridionalis and its associates belong, can\r\nbe shown to be of anterior date, in the north of France, to the flint\r\nimplements of St. Acheul, by the following train of reasoning. The\r\nvalley of the Seine is not only geographically contiguous to the valley\r\nof the Somme, but its ancient alluvium contains the same mammoth and\r\nother fossil species. The Eure, one of the tributaries of the Seine, in\r\nits way to join that river, flows in a valley which follows a line of\r\nfault in the Chalk; and this valley is seen to be comparatively modern,\r\nbecause it intersects at St. Prest, 4 miles below Chartres, an older\r\nvalley belonging to an anterior system of drainage, which has been\r\nfilled by a more ancient fluviatile alluvium, consisting of sand and\r\ngravel, 90 feet thick. I have examined the site of this older drift, and\r\nthe fossils have been determined by Dr. Falconer. They comprise Elephas\r\nmeridionalis, a species of rhinoceros (not R. tichorhinus), and other\r\nmammalia differing from those of the implement-bearing gravels of the\r\nSeine and Somme. The latter, belonging to the period of the mammoth,\r\nmight very well have been contemporary with the modern volcanic\r\neruptions of Central France; and we may presume, even without the aid of\r\nthe Denise fossil, that Man may have witnessed these. But the tuffs and\r\ngravels in which the Elephas meridionalis are embedded were synchronous\r\nwith an older epoch of volcanic action, to which the cone of St. Anne,\r\nnear Le Puy, and many other mountains of M. Bertrand de Doue's middle\r\nperiod belong, having cones and craters, which have undergone much\r\nwaste by aqueous erosion. We have as yet no proof that Man witnessed\r\nthe origin of these hills of lava and scoriae of the middle phase of\r\nvolcanic action.\r\n\r\nSome surprise was expressed in 1856, by several of the assembled\r\nnaturalists at Le Puy, that the skull of the \"fossil man of Denise,\"\r\nalthough contemporary with the mammoth, and coeval with the last\r\neruptions of the Le Puy volcanoes [18], should be of the ordinary\r\nCaucasian or European type; but the observations of Professor Huxley on\r\nthe Engis skull, cited in the fifth chapter, showing the near approach\r\nof that ancient cranium to the European standard, will help to remove\r\nthis source of perplexity.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMAN FOSSIL OF NATCHEZ ON THE MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to Dr. Dowler's attempt to calculate, in years,\r\nthe antiquity of the human skeleton said to have been buried under four\r\ncypress forests in the delta of the Mississippi, near New Orleans (see\r\nabove, Chapter 3). In that case no remains of extinct animals were found\r\nassociated with those of Man: but in another part of the basin of\r\nthe Mississippi, a human bone, accompanied by bones of Mastodon and\r\nMegalonyx, is supposed to have been washed out of a more ancient\r\nalluvial deposit.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting the spot in 1846, I described the geological position\r\nof the bones, and discussed their probable age, with a stronger bias, I\r\nmust confess, as to the antecedent improbability of the contemporaneous\r\nentombment of Man and the mastodon than any geologist would now be\r\njustified in entertaining.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 26. Alluvial Plain of the Mississippi]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 26. SECTION THROUGH THE ALLUVIAL PLAIN OF THE MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\n  1. Modern alluvium of the Mississippi.\r\n  2. Loam or loess.\r\n  3. f. Eocene.\r\n  4. Cretaceous.)\r\n\r\nIn the latitude of Vicksburg, 32 degrees 50 minutes north, the broad,\r\nflat, alluvial plain of the Mississippi, a b, Figure 26, is bounded on\r\nits eastern side by a table-land d e, about 200 feet higher than the\r\nriver, and extending 12 miles eastward with a gentle upward slope. This\r\nelevated platform ends abruptly at d, in a line of perpendicular cliffs\r\nor bluffs, the base of which is continually undermined by the great\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nThe table-land d-e consists at Vicksburg, through which the annexed\r\nsection, Figure 26, passes, of loam, overlying the Tertiary strata f-f.\r\nBetween the loam and the Tertiary formation there is usually a deposit\r\nof stratified sand and gravel, containing large fragments of silicified\r\ncorals and the wreck of older Palaeozoic rocks. The age of this\r\nunderlying drift, which is 140 feet thick at Natchez, has not yet been\r\ndetermined; but it may possibly belong to the glacial period. Natchez is\r\nabout 80 miles in a straight line south of Vicksburg, on the same left\r\nbank of the Mississippi. Here there is a bluff, the upper 60 feet of\r\nwhich consists of a continuous portion of the same calcareous loam as at\r\nVicksburg, equally resembling the Rhenish loess in mineral character\r\nand in being sometimes barren of fossils, sometimes so full of them that\r\nbleached land-shells stand out conspicuously in relief in the vertical\r\nand weathered face of cliffs which form the banks of streams, everywhere\r\nintersecting the loam.\r\n\r\nSo numerous are the shells that I was able to collect at Natchez, in\r\na few hours, in 1846, no less than twenty species of the genera Helix,\r\nHelicina, Pupa, Cyclostoma, Achatina, and Succinea, all identical with\r\nshells now living in the same country; and in one place I observed (as\r\nhappens also occasionally in the valley of the Rhine) a passage of the\r\nloam with land-shells into an underlying marly deposit of subaqueous\r\norigin, in which shells of the genera Limnaea, Planorbis, Paludina,\r\nPhysa, and Cyclas were embedded, also consisting of recent American\r\nspecies. Such deposits, more distinctly stratified than the loam\r\ncontaining land-shells, are produced, as before stated, in all great\r\nalluvial plains, where the river shifts its position, and where marshes,\r\nponds, and lakes are formed in its old deserted channels. In this part\r\nof America, however, it may have happened that some of these lakes\r\nwere caused by partial subsidences, such as were witnessed, during\r\nthe earthquakes of 1811-12, around New Madrid, in the valley of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nOwing to the destructible nature of the yellow loam, d e, Figure 26,\r\nevery streamlet flowing over the platform has cut for itself, in its way\r\nto the Mississippi, a deep gully or ravine; and this erosion has of\r\nlate years, especially since 1812, proceeded with accelerated speed,\r\nascribable in some degree to the partial clearing of the native forest,\r\nbut partly also to the effects of the earthquake of 1811-12. By\r\nthat convulsion the region around Natchez was rudely shaken and much\r\nfissured. One of the narrow valleys near Natchez, due to this fissuring,\r\nis now called the Mammoth Ravine. Though no less than 7 miles long,\r\nand in some parts 60 feet deep, I was assured by a resident proprietor,\r\nColonel Wiley, that it had no existence before 1812. With its numerous\r\nramifications, it is said to have been entirely formed since the\r\nearthquake at New Madrid. Before that event, Colonel Wiley had ploughed\r\nsome of the land exactly over a spot now traversed by part of this\r\nwater-course.\r\n\r\nI satisfied myself that the ravine had been considerably enlarged\r\nand lengthened a short time before my visit, and it was then freshly\r\nundermined and undergoing constant waste. From a clayey deposit\r\nimmediately below the yellow loam, bones of the Mastodon ohioticus, a\r\nspecies of Megalonyx, bones of the genera Equus, Bos, and others,\r\nsome of extinct and others presumed to be of living species, had been\r\ndetached, and had fallen to the base of the cliffs. Mingled with the\r\nrest, the pelvic bone of a man, os innominatum, was obtained by Dr.\r\nDickeson of Natchez, in whose collection I saw it. It appeared to be\r\nquite in the same state of preservation, and was of the same black\r\ncolour as the other fossils, and was believed to have come like them\r\nfrom a depth of about 30 feet from the surface. In my \"Second Visit\r\nto America,\" in 1846, I suggested, as a possible explanation of this\r\nassociation of a human bone with remains of Mastodon and Megalonyx, that\r\nthe former may possibly have been derived from the vegetable soil at the\r\ntop of the cliff, whereas the remains of extinct mammalia were dislodged\r\nfrom a lower position, and both may have fallen into the same heap or\r\ntalus at the bottom of the ravine. The pelvic bone might, I conceived,\r\nhave acquired its black colour by having lain for years or centuries\r\nin a dark superficial peaty soil, common in that region. I was informed\r\nthat there were many human bones, in old Indian graves in the same\r\ndistrict, stained of as black a dye. On suggesting this hypothesis\r\nto Colonel Wiley of Natchez, I found that the same idea had already\r\noccurred to his mind. No doubt, had the pelvic bone belonged to any\r\nrecent mammifer other than Man, such a theory would never have been\r\nresorted to; but so long as we have only one isolated case, and are\r\nwithout the testimony of a geologist who was present to behold the bone\r\nwhen still engaged in the matrix, and to extract it with his own hands,\r\nit is allowable to suspend our judgment as to the high antiquity of the\r\nfossil.\r\n\r\nIf, however, I am asked whether I consider the Natchez loam, with\r\nland-shells and the bones of Mastodon and Megalonyx, to be more ancient\r\nthan the alluvium of the Somme containing flint implements and the\r\nremains of the mammoth and hyaena, I must declare that I do not. Both\r\nin Europe and America the land and freshwater shells accompanying the\r\nextinct pachyderms are of living species, and I could detect no shell\r\nin the Natchez loam so foreign to the basin of the Mississippi as is\r\nthe Cyrena fluminalis to the rivers of modern Europe. If, therefore, the\r\nrelative ages of the Picardy and Natchez alluvium were to be decided on\r\nconchological data alone, the fluvio-marine beds of Abbeville might rank\r\nas a shade older than the loess of Natchez. My reluctance in 1846 to\r\nregard the fossil human bone as of Pleistocene date arose in part from\r\nthe reflection that the ancient loess of Natchez is anterior in time to\r\nthe whole modern delta of the Mississippi. The table-land, d e, Figure\r\n26, was, I believe, once a part of the original alluvial plain or delta\r\nof the great river before it was upraised. It has now risen more than\r\n200 feet above its pristine level. After the upheaval, or during it, the\r\nMississippi cut through the old fluviatile formation of which its\r\nbluffs are now formed, just as the Rhine has in many parts of its\r\nvalley excavated a passage through the ancient loess. If I was right in\r\ncalculating that the present delta of the Mississippi must have required\r\nmany tens of thousands of years for its growth, and if the claims of the\r\nNatchez man to have co-existed with the mastodon are admitted, it would\r\nfollow that North America was peopled by the human race many tens of\r\nthousands of years before our time. But even were that true, we could\r\nnot presume, reasoning from ascertained geological data, that the\r\nNatchez bone was anterior in date to the antique flint hatchets of St.\r\nAcheul. When we ascend the Mississippi from Natchez to Vicksburg, and\r\nthen enter the Ohio, we are accompanied everywhere by a continuous\r\nfringe of terraces of sand and gravel at a certain height above the\r\nalluvial plain, first of the great river, and then of its tributary.\r\nWe also find that the older alluvium contains the remains of Mastodon\r\neverywhere, and in some places, as at Evansville, those of the\r\nMegalonyx. As in the valley of the Somme in Europe, those old\r\nPleistocene gravels often occur at more than one level, and the ancient\r\nmounds of the Ohio, with their works of art, are newer than the old\r\nterraces of the mastodon period, just as the Gallo-Roman tombs of St.\r\nAcheul or the Celtic weapons of the Abbeville peat are more modern than\r\nthe tools of the mammoth-bearing alluvium.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I may remind the reader that the vertical movement\r\nof 250 feet, required to elevate the loess of Natchez to its present\r\nheight, is exceeded by the upheaval which the marine stratum of\r\nCagliari, containing pottery, has been ascertained by Count de la\r\nMarmora to have experienced. Such changes of level, therefore, have\r\nactually occurred in Europe in the human epoch, and may therefore have\r\nhappened in America. In the second place, I may observe that if, since\r\nthe Natchez mastodon was embedded in clay, the delta of the Mississippi\r\nhas been formed, so, since the mammoth and rhinoceros of Abbeville and\r\nAmiens were enveloped in fluviatile mud and gravel, together with flint\r\ntools, a great thickness of peat has accumulated in the valley of the\r\nSomme; and antecedently to the first growth of peat, there had been time\r\nfor the extinction of a great many mammalia, requiring, perhaps, a lapse\r\nof ages many times greater than that demanded for the formation of 30\r\nfeet of peat, for since the earliest growth of the latter there has been\r\nno change in the species of mammalia in Europe.\r\n\r\nShould future researches, therefore, confirm the opinion that the\r\nNatchez man co-existed with the mastodon, it would not enhance the value\r\nof the geological evidence in favour of Man's antiquity, but merely\r\nrender the delta of the Mississippi available as a chronometer, by which\r\nthe lapse of Pleistocene time could be measured somewhat less vaguely\r\nthan by any means of measuring which have as yet been discovered or\r\nrendered available in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. -- ANTIQUITY OF MAN RELATIVELY TO THE GLACIAL PERIOD AND TO\r\nTHE EXISTING FAUNA AND FLORA.\r\n\r\n  Chronological Relation of the Glacial Period, and the earliest\r\n     known Signs of Man's Appearance in Europe.\r\n  Series of Tertiary Deposits in Norfolk and Suffolk immediately\r\n     antecedent to the Glacial Period.\r\n  Gradual Refrigeration of Climate proved by the Marine Shells\r\n     of successive Groups.\r\n  Marine Newer Pliocene Shells of Northern Character near Woodbridge.\r\n  Section of the Norfolk Cliffs.\r\n  Norwich Crag.\r\n  Forest Bed and Fluvio-marine Strata.\r\n  Fossil Plants and Mammalia of the same.\r\n  Overlying Boulder Clay and Contorted Drift.\r\n  Newer freshwater Formation of Mundesley compared to that of Hoxne.\r\n  Great Oscillations of Level implied by the Series of Strata in the\r\n     Norfolk Cliffs.\r\n  Earliest known Date of Man long subsequent to the existing Fauna\r\n     and Flora.\r\n\r\nFrequent allusions have been made in the preceding pages to a period\r\ncalled the glacial, to which no reference is made in the Chronological\r\nTable of Formations given above (Chapter 1). It comprises a long series\r\nof ages, during which the power of cold, whether exerted by glaciers\r\non the land, or by floating ice on the sea, was greater in the northern\r\nhemisphere, and extended to more southern latitudes than now. [19]\r\n\r\nIt often happens that when in any given region we have pushed back our\r\ngeological investigations as far as we can in search of evidence of the\r\nfirst appearance of Man in Europe, we are stopped by arriving at what is\r\ncalled the \"boulder clay\" or \"northern drift.\" This formation is usually\r\nquite destitute of organic remains, so that the thread of our inquiry\r\ninto the history of the animate creation, as well as of man, is abruptly\r\ncut short. The interruption, however, is by no means encountered at the\r\nsame point of time in every district. In the case of the Danish peat,\r\nfor example, we get no farther back than the Recent period of our\r\nChronologic Table, and then meet with the boulder clay; and it is the\r\nsame in the valley of the Clyde, where the marine strata contain\r\nthe ancient canoes before described (Chapter 3), and where nothing\r\nintervenes between that Recent formation and the glacial drift. But we\r\nhave seen that, in the neighbourhood of Bedford the memorials of Man can\r\nbe traced much farther back into the past, namely, into the Pleistocene\r\nepoch, when the human race was contemporary with the mammoth and many\r\nother species of mammalia now extinct. Nevertheless, in Bedfordshire as\r\nin Denmark, the formation next antecedent in date to that containing\r\nthe human implements is still a member of the glacial drift, with its\r\nerratic blocks.\r\n\r\nIf the reader remembers what was stated in the eighth chapter as to\r\nthe absence or extreme scarcity of human bones and works of art in\r\nall strata, whether marine or freshwater, even in those formed in the\r\nimmediate proximity of land inhabited by millions of human beings, he\r\nwill be prepared for the general dearth of human memorials in glacial\r\nformations, whether Recent, Pleistocene, or of more ancient date. If\r\nthere were a few wanderers over lands covered with glaciers, or over\r\nseas infested with ice-bergs, and if a few of them left their bones or\r\nweapons in moraines or in marine drift, the chances, after the lapse\r\nof thousands of years, of a geologist meeting with one of them must be\r\ninfinitesimally small.\r\n\r\nIt is natural, therefore, to encounter a gap in the regular sequence\r\nof geological monuments bearing on the past history of Man, wherever we\r\nhave proofs of glacial action having prevailed with intensity, as it has\r\ndone over large parts of Europe and North America, in the Pleistocene\r\nperiod. As we advance into more southern latitudes approaching the 50th\r\nparallel of latitude in Europe, and the 40th in North America, this\r\ndisturbing cause ceases to oppose a bar to our inquiries; but even then,\r\nin consequence of the fragmentary nature of all geological annals, our\r\nprogress is inevitably slow in constructing anything like a connected\r\nchain of history, which can only be effected by bringing the links of\r\nthe chain found in one area to supply the information which is wanting\r\nin another.\r\n\r\nThe least interrupted series of consecutive documents to which we can\r\nrefer in the British Islands, when we desire to connect the Pliocene\r\nwith the Pleistocene periods, are found in the counties of Norfolk,\r\nSuffolk, and Essex; and I shall speak of them in this chapter, as they\r\nhave a direct bearing on the relations of the human and glacial periods,\r\nwhich will be the subject of several of the following chapters. The\r\nfossil shells of the deposits in question clearly point to a gradual\r\nrefrigeration of climate, from a temperature somewhat warmer than\r\nthat now prevailing in our latitudes to one of intense cold; and the\r\nsuccessive steps which have marked the coming on of the increasing cold\r\nare matters of no small geological interest. [20]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen in the Chronological Table, that next before the\r\nPleistocene period stands the Pliocene. The shelly and sandy\r\nbeds representing these periods in Norfolk and Suffolk are termed\r\nprovincially Crag, having under the name been long used in agriculture\r\nto fertilise soils deficient in calcareous matter, or to render them\r\nless stiff and impervious. In Suffolk, the older Pliocene strata called\r\nCrag are divisible into the Coralline and the Red Crags, the former\r\nbeing the older of the two. In Norfolk, a more modern formation,\r\ncommonly termed the \"Norwich,\" or sometimes the \"mammaliferous\" Crag,\r\nwhich is referable to the newer Pliocene period, occupies large areas.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Mr. Searles Wood, F.G.S., for an admirable monograph\r\non the fossil shells of these British Pliocene formations. He has not\r\nhimself given us an analysis of the results of his treatise, but the\r\nfollowing tables have been drawn up for me by Mr. S.P. Woodward, the\r\nwell-known author of the \"Manual of Mollusca, Recent and Fossil\" (London\r\n1851-56), in order to illustrate some of the general conclusions to\r\nwhich Mr. Wood's careful examination of 442 species of mollusca has led.\r\n\r\nTABLE 12/1.

It will be seen that in the Coralline\r\nCrag there are twenty-seven southern shells, including twenty-six\r\nMediterranean, and one West Indian species (Erato Maugeriae). Of these\r\nonly thirteen occur in the Red Crag, associated with three new southern\r\nspecies, while the whole of them disappear from the Norwich beds. On the\r\nother hand, the Coralline Crag contains only two shells closely\r\nrelated to arctic forms of the genera Admete and Limopsis. The Red Crag\r\ncontains, as stated in the table, eight northern species, all of which\r\nrecur in the Norwich Crag, with the addition of four others, also\r\ninhabitants of the arctic regions; so that there is good evidence of\r\na continual refrigeration of climate during the Pliocene period in\r\nBritain. The presence of these northern shells cannot be explained away\r\nby supposing that they were inhabitants of the deep parts of the sea;\r\nfor some of them, such as Tellina calcarea and Astarte borealis, occur\r\nplentifully, and sometimes, with the valves united by their ligament, in\r\ncompany with other littoral shells, such as Mya arenaria and Littorina\r\nrudis, and evidently not thrown up from deep water. Yet the northern\r\ncharacter of the Norwich Crag is not fully shown by simply saying that\r\nit contains twelve northern species. It is the predominance of certain\r\ngenera and species, such as Tellina calcarea, Astarte borealis, Scalaria\r\ngroenlandica, and Fusus carinatus, which satisfies the mind of a\r\nconchologist as to the arctic character of the Norwich Crag. In like\r\nmanner, it is the presence of such genera as Pyrula, Columbella,\r\nTerebra, Cassidaria, Pholadomya, Lingula, Discina, and others which give\r\na southern aspect to the Coralline Crag shells.\r\n\r\nThe cold, which had gone on increasing from the time of the Coralline\r\nto that of the Norwich Crag, continued, though not perhaps without some\r\noscillations of temperature, to become more and more severe after the\r\naccumulation of the Norwich Crag, until it reached its maximum in what\r\nhas been called the glacial epoch. The marine fauna of this last period\r\ncontains, both in Ireland and Scotland, Recent species of mollusca now\r\nliving in Greenland and other seas far north of the areas where we find\r\ntheir remains in a fossil state.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration of climate from the time of the older to that of the\r\nnewer Pliocene strata is not now announced for the first time, as it\r\nwas inferred from a study of the Crag shells in 1846 by the late Edward\r\nForbes.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Memoirs of the Geological Survey\" London 1846 page 391.)\r\n\r\nThe most southern point to which the marine beds of the Norwich Crag\r\nhave yet been traced is at Chillesford, near Woodbridge, in Suffolk,\r\nabout 80 miles north-east of London, where, as Messrs. Prestwich and\r\nSearles Wood have pointed out,* they exhibit decided marks of having\r\nbeen deposited in a sea of a much lower temperature than that now\r\nprevailing in the same latitude. (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological\r\nSociety\" volume 5 1849 page 345.) Out of twenty-three shells obtained in\r\nthat locality from argillaceous strata 20 feet thick, two only, namely,\r\nNucula Cobboldiae and Tellina obliqua, are extinct, and not a few of the\r\nother species, such as Leda lanceolata, Cardium groenlandicum, Lucina\r\nborealis, Cyprina islandica, Panopaea norvegica, and Mya truncata,\r\nbetray a northern, and some of them an arctic character.\r\n\r\nThese Chillesford beds are supposed to be somewhat more modern than\r\nany of the purely marine strata of the Norwich Crag exhibited by the\r\nsections of the Norfolk cliffs north-west of Cromer, which I am about\r\nto describe. Yet they probably preceded in date the \"Forest Bed\" and\r\nfluvio-marine deposits of those same cliffs. They are, therefore, of no\r\nsmall importance in reference to the chronology of the glacial period,\r\nsince they afford evidence of an assemblage of fossil shells with a\r\nproportion of between eight and nine in a hundred of extinct species\r\noccurring so far south as latitude 53 degrees north, and indicating so\r\ncold a climate as to imply that the glacial period commenced before the\r\nclose of the Pliocene era.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 27.

These cliffs vary in height\r\nfrom fifty to above three hundred feet. At the north-western extremity\r\nof the section at Weybourn (beyond the limits of the annexed diagram),\r\nand from thence to Cromer, a distance of 7 miles, the Norwich Crag, a\r\nmarine deposit, reposes immediately upon the Chalk. A vast majority\r\nof its shells are of living species such as Cardium edule, Cyprina\r\nislandica, Scalaria groenlandica, and Fusus antiquus, and some few\r\nextinct, as Tellina obliqua, and Nucula Cobboldiae. At Cromer jetty this\r\nformation thins out, as expressed in the diagram at A; and to the south\r\nwe find Number 3, or what is commonly called the \"Forest Bed,\" reposing\r\nimmediately upon the Chalk, and occupying, as it were, the place\r\npreviously held by the marine Crag Number 2. This buried forest has\r\nbeen traced for more than 40 miles, being exposed at certain seasons\r\nand states of the beach between high and low water mark. It extends from\r\nCromer to near Kessingland, and consists of the stumps of numerous trees\r\nstanding erect, with their roots attached to them, and penetrating in\r\nall directions into the loam or ancient vegetable soil on which they\r\ngrew. They mark the site of a forest which existed there for a long\r\ntime, since, besides the erect trunks of trees, some of them 2 and 3\r\nfeet in diameter, there is a vast accumulation of vegetable matter in\r\nthe immediately overlying clays. Thirty years ago, when I first examined\r\nthis bed, I saw many trees, with their roots in the old soil, laid open\r\nat the base of the cliff near Happisburgh; and long before my visit,\r\nother observers, and among them the late Mr. J.C. Taylor, had noticed\r\nthe buried forest. Of late years it has been repeatedly seen at many\r\npoints by Mr. Gunn, and, after the great storms of the autumn of 1861,\r\nby Mr. King. In order to expose the stumps to view, a vast body of sand\r\nand shingle must be cleared away by the force of the waves. [21]\r\n\r\nAs the sea is always gaining on the land, new sets of trees are brought\r\nto light from time to time, so that the breadth as well as length of the\r\narea of ancient forest land seems to have been considerable. Next above\r\nNumber 3, we find a series of sands and clays with lignite (Number\r\n3 prime), sometimes 10 feet thick, and containing alternations of\r\nfluviatile and marine strata, implying that the old forest land, which\r\nmay at first have been considerably elevated above the level of the sea,\r\nhad sunk down so as to be occasionally overflowed by a river, and\r\nat other times by the salt waters of an estuary. There were probably\r\nseveral oscillations of level which assisted in bringing about these\r\nchanges, during which trees were often uprooted and laid prostrate,\r\ngiving rise to layers of lignite. Occasionally marshes were formed and\r\npeaty matter accumulated, after which salt water again predominated, so\r\nthat species of Mytilus, Mya, Leda, and other marine genera, lived in\r\nthe same area where the Unio, Cyclas, and Paludina had flourished for\r\na time. That the marine shells lived and died on the spot, and were\r\nnot thrown up by the waves during a storm, is proved, as Mr. King has\r\nremarked, by the fact that at West Runton, north-west of Cromer, the Mya\r\ntruncata and Leda myalis are found with both valves united and erect in\r\nthe loam, all with their posterior or siphuncular extremities uppermost.\r\nThis attitude affords as good evidence to the conchologist that those\r\nmollusca lived and died on the spot as the upright position of the trees\r\nproves to the botanist that there was a forest over the Chalk east of\r\nCromer.\r\n\r\nBetween the stumps of the buried forest, and in the lignite above them,\r\nare many well-preserved cones of the Scotch and spruce firs, Pinus\r\nsylvestris, and Pinus abies. The specific names of these fossils were\r\ndetermined for me in 1840, by a botanist of no less authority than\r\nthe late Robert Brown; and Professor Heer has lately examined a large\r\ncollection from the same stratum, and recognised among the cones of the\r\nspruce some which had only the central part or axis remaining, the rest\r\nhaving been bitten off, precisely in the same manner as when in our\r\nwoods the squirrel has been feeding on the seeds. There is also in the\r\nforest-bed a great quantity of resin in lumps, resembling that gathered\r\nfor use, according to Professor Heer, in Switzerland, from beneath\r\nspruce firs.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of some of the plants and seeds which were\r\ncollected by the Reverend S.W. King, in 1861, from the forest bed at\r\nHappisburgh, and named by Professor Heer:--\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTS AND SEEDS OF THE FOREST AND LIGNITE BEDS BELOW THE GLACIAL DRIFT\r\nOF THE NORFOLK CLIFFS.\r\n\r\n     Pinus sylvestris, Scotch fir.\r\n     Pinus abies, spruce fir.\r\n     Taxus baccata, yew.\r\n     Nuphar luteum, yellow water-lily.\r\n     Ceratophyllum demersum, hornwort.\r\n     Potamogeton, pondweed.\r\n     Prunus spinosus, common sloe.\r\n     Menyanthes trifoliata, buckbean.\r\n     Nymphaea alba, white water-lily.\r\n     Alnus, alder.\r\n     Quercus, oak.\r\n     Betula, birch.\r\n\r\nThe insects, so far as they are known, including several species of\r\nDonacia, are, like the plants and freshwater shells, of living species.\r\nIt may be remarked, however, that the Scotch fir has been confined in\r\nhistorical times to the northern parts of the British Isles, and the\r\nspruce fir is nowhere indigenous in Great Britain. The other plants are\r\nsuch as might now be found in Norfolk, and many of them indicate fenny\r\nor marshy ground.*\r\n\r\n     (* Mr. King discovered in 1863, in the forest bed, several\r\n     rhizomes of the large British fern Osmunda regalis, of such\r\n     dimensions as they are known to attain in marshy places.\r\n     They are distinguishable from those of other British ferns\r\n     by the peculiar arrangement of the vessels, as seen under\r\n     the microscope in a cross section.)\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the familiar aspect of the flora, the accompanying\r\nmammalia are certainly most extraordinary. There are no less than three\r\nelephants, a rhinoceros and hippopotamus, a large extinct beaver, and\r\nseveral large estuarine and marine mammalia, such as the walrus, the\r\nnarwhal, and the whale.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of some of the species of which the bones have\r\nbeen collected by Messrs. Gunn and King.\r\n\r\nThose marked (asterisk) have been recorded by Professor Owen in his\r\nBritish Fossil Mammalia. Those marked (dagger) have been recognised by\r\nthe same authority in the cabinets of Messrs. Gunn and King, or in\r\nthe Norwich Museum; the other three are given on the authority of Dr.\r\nFalconer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAMMALIA OF THE FOREST AND LIGNITE BEDS BELOW THE GLACIAL DRIFT OF THE\r\nNORFOLK CLIFFS.\r\n\r\n     Elephas meridionalis.\r\n     (asterisk) Elephas primigenius.\r\n     Elephas antiquus.\r\n     Rhinoceros etruscus.\r\n     (asterisk) Hippopotamus (major?).\r\n     (asterisk) Sus scrofa.\r\n     (asterisk) Equus (fossilis?).\r\n     (asterisk) Ursus (sp.?).\r\n     (dagger) Canis lupus.\r\n     (dagger) Bison priscus.\r\n     (dagger) Megaceros hibernicus.\r\n     (asterisk) Cervus capreolus.\r\n     (dagger) Cervus tarandus.\r\n     (dagger) Cervus Sedgwickii.\r\n     (asterisk) Arvicola amphibia.\r\n     (asterisk) Castor (Trogontherium) Cuvieri.\r\n     (asterisk) Castor europaeus.\r\n     (asterisk) Palaeospalax magnus.\r\n     (dagger) Trichecus rosmarus, Walrus.\r\n     (dagger) Monodon monoceros, Narwhal.\r\n     (dagger) Balaenoptera.\r\n\r\nMr. Gunn informs me that the vertebrae of two distinct whales were found\r\nin the fluvio-marine beds at Bacton, and that one of them, shown to\r\nProfessor Owen, is said by him to imply that the animal was 60 feet\r\nlong. A narwhal's tusk was discovered by Mr. King near Cromer, and\r\nthe remains of a walrus. No less than three species of elephant, as\r\ndetermined by Dr. Falconer, have been obtained from the strata 3 and\r\n3 prime, of which, according to Mr. King, E. meridionalis is the most\r\ncommon, the mammoth next in abundance, and the third, E. antiquus,\r\ncomparatively rare.\r\n\r\nThe freshwater shells accompanying the fossil quadrupeds, above\r\nenumerated, are such as now inhabit rivers and ponds in England; but\r\namong them, as at Runton, between the \"forest bed\" and the glacial\r\ndeposits, a remarkable variety of the Cyclas amnica occurs (Figure 28),\r\nidentical with that which accompanies the Elephas antiquus at Ilford and\r\nGrays in the valley of the Thames.\r\n\r\nAll the freshwater shells of the beds intervening between the Forest-bed\r\nNumber 3, and the glacial formation 4, Figure 27, are of Recent\r\nspecies. As to the small number of marine shells occurring in the\r\nsame fluvio-marine series, I have seen none which belonged to extinct\r\nspecies, although one or two have been cited by authors. I am in doubt,\r\ntherefore, whether to class the forest bed and overlying strata as\r\nPleistocene, or to consider them as beds of passage between the Pliocene\r\nand Pleistocene periods. The fluvio-marine series usually terminates\r\nupwards in finely laminated sands and clays without fossils, on which\r\nreposes the boulder clay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 28. Cyclas]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 28. Cyclas (Pisidium) amnica var.?\r\n   The two middle figures are of the natural size.)\r\n\r\nThis formation, Number 4, is of very varying thickness. Its glacial\r\ncharacter is shown, not only by the absence of stratification, and the\r\ngreat size and angularity of some of the included blocks of distant\r\norigin, but also by the polished and scratched surfaces of such of them\r\nas are hard enough to retain any markings.\r\n\r\nNear Cromer, blocks of granite from 6 to 8 feet in diameter have been\r\nmet with, and smaller ones of syenite, porphyry, and trap, besides\r\nthe wreck of the London Clay, Chalk, Oolite, and Lias, mixed with more\r\nancient fossiliferous rocks. Erratics of Scandinavian origin occur\r\nchiefly in the lower portions of the till. I came to the conclusion in\r\n1834, that they had really come from Norway and Sweden, after having in\r\nthat year traced the course of a continuous stream of such blocks from\r\nthose countries to Denmark, and across the Elbe, through Westphalia,\r\nto the borders of Holland. It is not surprising that they should then\r\nreappear on our eastern coast between the Tweed and the Thames, regions\r\nnot half so remote from parts of Norway as are many Russian erratics\r\nfrom the sources whence they came. [22]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 29. Cliff]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 29. CLIFF 50 FEET HIGH BETWEEN BACTON GAP AND MUNDESLEY.\r\n   Section through Gravel (top), Sand, Loam and Till (bottom).)\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of the Reverend J. Gunn and the late Mr.\r\nTrimmer, the glacial drift in the cliffs at Lowestoft consists of\r\ntwo divisions, the lower of which abounds in the Scandinavian blocks,\r\nsupposed to have come from the north-east; while the upper, probably\r\nbrought by a current from the north-west, contains chiefly fragments of\r\nOolitic rocks, more rolled than those of the lower deposit. The united\r\nthickness of the two divisions, without reckoning some interposed\r\nlaminated beds, is 80 feet, but it probably exceeds 100 feet near\r\nHappisburgh.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 7\r\n     1851 page 21.)\r\n\r\nAlthough these subdivisions of the drift may be only of local\r\nimportance, they help to show the changes of currents and other\r\nconditions, and the great lapse of time which the accumulation of so\r\nvaried a series of deposits must have required.\r\n\r\nThe lowest part of the glacial till, resting on the laminated clays\r\nbefore mentioned, is very even and regular, while its upper surface\r\nis remarkable for the unevenness of its outline, owing partly, in all\r\nlikelihood, to denudation, but still more to other causes presently to\r\nbe discussed.\r\n\r\nThe overlying strata of sand and gravel, Number 5, Figure 27, often\r\ndisplay a most singular derangement in their stratification, which in\r\nmany places seems to have a very intimate relation to the irregularities\r\nof outline in the subjacent till. There are some cases, however, where\r\nthe upper strata are much bent, while the lower beds of the same\r\nseries have continued horizontal. Thus the annexed section (Figure 29)\r\nrepresents a cliff about 50 feet high, at the bottom of which is till,\r\nor unstratified clay, containing boulders, having an even horizontal\r\nsurface, on which repose conformably beds of laminated clay and sand\r\nabout 5 feet thick, which, in their turn, are succeeded by vertical,\r\nbent, and contorted layers of sand and loam 20 feet thick, the whole\r\nbeing covered by flint gravel. The curves of the variously coloured beds\r\nof loose sand, loam, and pebbles, are so complicated that not only may\r\nwe sometimes find portions of them which maintain their verticality to a\r\nheight of 10 or 15 feet, but they have also been folded upon themselves\r\nin such a manner that continuous layers might be thrice pierced in one\r\nperpendicular boring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figures 30 and 31. Strata]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 30. FOLDING OF THE STRATA BETWEEN EAST AND WEST RUNTON.)\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 31. SECTION OF CONCENTRIC BEDS WEST OF CROMER.\r\n\r\n  1. Blue clay.\r\n  2. White sand.\r\n  3. Yellow Sand.\r\n  4. Striped loam and clay.\r\n  5. Laminated blue clay.)\r\n\r\nAt some points there is an apparent folding of the beds round a central\r\nnucleus, as at a, Figure 30, where the strata seem bent round a small\r\nmass of Chalk, or, as in Figure 31, where the blue clay Number 1 is in\r\nthe centre; and where the other strata 2, 3, 4, 5 are coiled round it;\r\nthe entire mass being 20 feet in perpendicular height. This appearance\r\nof concentric arrangement around a nucleus is, nevertheless, delusive,\r\nbeing produced by the intersection of beds bent into a convex shape; and\r\nthat which seems the nucleus being, in fact, the innermost bed of\r\nthe series, which has become partially visible by the removal of the\r\nprotuberant portions of the outer layers.\r\n\r\nTo the north of Cromer are other fine illustrations of contorted drift\r\nreposing on a floor of Chalk horizontally stratified and having a\r\nlevel surface. These phenomena, in themselves sufficiently difficult\r\nof explanation, are rendered still more anomalous by the occasional\r\nenclosure in the drift of huge fragments of Chalk many yards in\r\ndiameter. One striking instance occurs west of Sheringham, where an\r\nenormous pinnacle of Chalk, between 70 and 80 feet in height, is flanked\r\non both sides by vertical layers of loam, clay, and gravel (Figure 32).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 32. Pinnacle of Chalk]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 32. INCLUDED PINNACLE OF CHALK AT OLD HYTHE POINT,\r\n   WEST OF SHERINGHAM.\r\n\r\n  d. Chalk with regular layers of flints.\r\n  c. Layer called \"the pan,\" of Chalk, flints, and marine shells\r\n     of Recent species, cemented by oxide of iron.)\r\n\r\nThis chalky fragment is only one of many detached masses which have\r\nbeen included in the drift, and forced along with it into their present\r\nposition. The level surface of the Chalk in situ (d) may be traced for\r\nmiles along the coast, where it has escaped the violent movements to\r\nwhich the incumbent drift has been exposed.*\r\n\r\n     (* For a full account of the drift of East Norfolk, see a\r\n     paper by the author, \"Philosophical Magazine\" Number 104 May\r\n     1840.)\r\n\r\nWe are called upon, then, to explain how any force can have been exerted\r\nagainst the upper masses, so as to produce movements in which the\r\nsubjacent strata have not participated. It may be answered that, if we\r\nconceive the till and its boulders to have been drifted to their\r\npresent place by ice, the lateral pressure may have been supplied by\r\nthe stranding of ice-islands. We learn, from the observations of Messrs.\r\nDease and Simpson in the polar regions, that such islands, when they\r\nrun aground, push before them large mounds of shingle and sand. It\r\nis therefore probable that they often cause great alterations in the\r\narrangement of pliant and incoherent strata forming the upper part of\r\nshoals or submerged banks, the inferior portions of the same remaining\r\nunmoved. Or many of the complicated curvatures of these layers of loose\r\nsand and gravel may have been due to another cause, the melting on the\r\nspot of ice-bergs and coast ice in which successive deposits of pebbles,\r\nsand, ice, snow, and mud, together with huge masses of rock fallen from\r\ncliffs, may have become interstratified. Ice-islands so constituted\r\noften capsize when afloat, and gravel once horizontal may have assumed,\r\nbefore the associated ice was melted, an inclined or vertical\r\nposition. The packing of ice forced up on a coast may lead to a similar\r\nderangement in a frozen conglomerate of sand or shingle, and, as Mr.\r\nTrimmer has suggested,* alternate layers of earthy matter may have sunk\r\ndown slowly during the liquefaction of the intercalated ice so as to\r\nassume the most fantastic and anomalous positions, while the strata\r\nbelow, and those afterwards thrown down above, may be perfectly\r\nhorizontal (see above).\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 7\r\n     1851 pages 22, 30.)\r\n\r\nIn most cases where the principal contortions of the layers of gravel\r\nand sand have a decided correspondence with deep indentations in the\r\nunderlying till, the hypothesis of the melting of large lumps and masses\r\nof ice once mixed up with the till affords the most natural explanation\r\nof the phenomena. The quantity of ice now seen in the cliffs near\r\nBehring's Straits, in which the remains of fossil elephants are common,\r\nand the huge fragments of solid ice which Meyendorf discovered in\r\nSiberia, after piercing through a considerable thickness of incumbent\r\nsoil, free from ice, is in favour of such an hypothesis, the partial\r\nfailure of support necessarily giving rise to foldings in the overlying\r\nand previously horizontal layers, as in the case of creeps in coal\r\nmines.*\r\n\r\n     (* See \"Manual of Geology\" by the author, page 51.)\r\n\r\nIn the diagram of the cliffs at page 167, the bent and contorted beds\r\nNumber 5, last alluded to, are represented as covered by undisturbed\r\nbeds of gravel and sand Number 6. These are usually destitute of organic\r\nremains; but at some points marine shells of Recent species are said to\r\nhave been found in them. They afford evidence at many points of repeated\r\ndenudation and redeposition, and may be the monuments of a long series\r\nof ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUNDESLEY POST-GLACIAL FRESHWATER FORMATION.\r\n\r\nIn the range of cliffs above described at Mundesley, about 8 miles\r\nsouth-east of Cromer, a fine example is seen of a freshwater formation,\r\nnewer than all those already mentioned, a deposit which has filled up a\r\ndepression hollowed out of all the older beds 3, 4, and 5 of the section\r\nFigure 27.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 33. Newer Freshwater Formation]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 33. SECTION OF THE NEWER FRESHWATER FORMATION I\r\n   N THE CLIFFS AT MUNDESLEY, EIGHT MILES SOUTH-EAST OF CROMER,\r\n   DRAWN UP BY THE REVEREND S.W.

Yellow sands.\r\n   D. Drift gravel.)\r\n\r\nWhen I examined this line of coast in 1839, the section alluded to\r\nwas not so clearly laid open to view as it has been of late years, and\r\nfinding at that period not a few of the fossils in the lignite beds\r\nNumber 3 prime above the forest bed, identical in species with those\r\nfrom the post-glacial deposits B C, I supposed the whole to have been of\r\ncontemporaneous origin, and so described them in my paper on the Norfolk\r\ncliffs.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Philosophical Magazine\" volume 16 1840 page 345.)\r\n\r\nMr. Gunn was the first to perceive this mistake, which he explained\r\nto me on the spot when I revisited Mundesley in the autumn of 1859 in\r\ncompany with Dr. Hooker and Mr. King. The last-named geologist has had\r\nthe kindness to draw up for me the annexed diagram (Figure 33) of the\r\nvarious beds which he has recently studied in detail.*\r\n\r\n     (* Mr. Prestwich has given a correct account of this section\r\n     in a paper read to the British Association, Oxford, 1860.\r\n     See \"The Geologist\" volume 4 1861.)\r\n\r\nThe formations 3, 4, and 5 already described, Figure 27, were evidently\r\nonce continuous, for they may be followed for miles north-west and\r\nsouth-east without a break, and always in the same order. A valley or\r\nriver channel was cut through them, probably during the gradual upheaval\r\nof the country, and the hollow became afterwards the receptacle of\r\nthe comparatively modern freshwater beds A, B, C, and D. They may well\r\nrepresent a silted up river-channel, which remained for a time in the\r\nstate of a lake or mere, and in which the black peaty mass B accumulated\r\nby a very slow growth over the gravel of the river-bed A. In B we find\r\nremains of some of the same plants which were enumerated as common\r\nin the ancient lignite in 3 prime, such as the yellow water-lily and\r\nhornwort, together with some freshwater shells which occur in the same\r\nfluvio-marine series 3 prime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 34. Paludina marginata]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 34. Paludina marginata, Michaud (P. minuta, Strickland).\r\n   Hydrobia marginata.*\r\n\r\n    (* This shell is said to have a sub-spiral operculum (not a\r\n      concentric one, as in Paludina), and therefore to be\r\n      referable to the Hydrobia, a sub-genus of Rissoa. But\r\n      this species is always associated with freshwater shells,\r\n      while the Rissoae frequent marine and brackish waters.)\r\n\r\n   The middle figure is of the natural size.)\r\n\r\nThe only shell which I found not referable to a British species is the\r\nminute Paludina, Figure 34, already alluded to.\r\n\r\nWhen I showed the scales and teeth of the pike, perch, roach, and\r\nsalmon, which I obtained from this formation, to M. Agassiz, he thought\r\nthey varied so much from their nearest living representatives that they\r\nmight rank as distinct species; but Mr. Yarrell doubted the propriety\r\nof so distinguishing them. The insects, like the shells and plants, are\r\nidentical, so far as they are known, with living British species. No\r\nprogress has yet been made at Mundesley in discovering the contemporary\r\nmammalia.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the description and section before given of the\r\nfreshwater deposit at Hoxne, the reader will at once perceive the\r\nstriking analogy of the Mundesley and Hoxne deposits, the latter so\r\nproductive of flint implements of the Amiens type. Both of them, like\r\nthe Bedford gravel with flint tools and the bones of extinct mammalia,\r\nare post-glacial. It will also be seen that a long series of events,\r\naccompanied by changes in physical geography, intervened between\r\nthe \"forest bed,\" Number 3, Figure 27, when the Elephas meridionalis\r\nflourished, and the period of the Mundesley fluviatile beds A, B, C;\r\njust as in France I have shown that the same E. meridionalis belonged to\r\na system of drainage different from and anterior to that with which the\r\nflint implements of the old alluvium of the Somme and the Seine were\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\nBefore the growth of the ancient forest, Number 3, Figure 33, the\r\nMastodon arvernensis, a large proboscidian, characteristic of the\r\nNorwich Crag, appears to have died out, or to have become scarce, as no\r\nremains of it have yet been found in the Norfolk cliffs. There was, no\r\ndoubt, time for other modifications in the mammalian fauna between the\r\nera of the marine beds, Number 2, Figure 27 (the shells of which imply\r\npermanent submergence beneath the sea), and the accumulation of the\r\nuppermost of the fluvio-marine, and lignite beds, Number 3 prime, which\r\noverlie both Numbers 3 and 2, or the buried forest and the Crag. In the\r\ninterval we must suppose repeated oscillations of level, during which\r\nland covered with trees, an estuary with its freshwater shells, and the\r\nsea with its Mya truncata and other mollusca still retaining their erect\r\nposition, gained by turns the ascendency. These changes were accompanied\r\nby some denudation followed by a grand submergence of several hundred\r\nfeet, probably brought about slowly, and when floating ice aided in\r\ntransporting erratic blocks from great distances. The glacial till\r\nNumber 4 then originated, and the gravel and sands Number 5 were\r\nafterwards superimposed on the boulder clay, first in horizontal beds,\r\nwhich became subsequently contorted. These were covered in their turn\r\nby other layers of gravel and sand, Number 6, Figures 27 and 33, the\r\ndownward movement still continuing.\r\n\r\nThe entire thickness of the beds above the Chalk at some points near the\r\ncoast, and the height at which they now are raised, are such as to show\r\nthat the subsidence of the country after the growth of the forest bed\r\nexceeded 400 feet. The re-elevation must have amounted to nearly as many\r\nfeet, as the site of the ancient forest, originally sub-aerial, has been\r\nbrought up again to within a few feet of high-water mark. Lastly, after\r\nall these events, and probably during the final process of emergence,\r\nthe valley was scooped out in which the newer freshwater strata of\r\nMundesley, Figure 33, were gradually deposited.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of this succession of geographical changes, the\r\nflora and invertebrate fauna of Europe appear to have undergone no\r\nimportant revolution in their specific characters. The plants of the\r\nforest bed belonged already to what has been called the Germanic flora.\r\nThe mollusca, the insects, and even some of the mammalia, such as the\r\nEuropean beaver and roebuck, were the same as those now co-existing with\r\nMan. Yet the oldest memorials of our species at present discovered in\r\nGreat Britain are post-glacial, or posterior in date to the boulder\r\nclay, Number 4, Figures 27 and 33. The position of the Hoxne flint\r\nimplements corresponds with that of the Mundesley beds, from A to D,\r\nFigure 33, and the most likely stratum in which to find hereafter\r\nflint tools is no doubt the gravel A of that section, which has all the\r\nappearance of an old river-bed. No flint tools have yet been observed\r\nthere, but had the old alluvium of Amiens or Abbeville occurred in the\r\nNorfolk cliffs instead of the valley of the Somme, and had we depended\r\non the waves of the sea instead of the labour of many hundred workmen\r\ncontinued for twenty years, for exposing the flint implements to view,\r\nwe might have remained ignorant to this day of the fossil relics brought\r\nto light by M. Boucher de Perthes and those who have followed up his\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\nNeither need we despair of one day meeting with the signs of Man's\r\nexistence in the forest bed Number 3, or in the overlying strata 3\r\nprime, on the ground of any uncongeniality in the climate or incongruity\r\nin the state of the animate creation with the well-being of our species.\r\nFor the present we must be content to wait and consider that we have\r\nmade no investigations which entitle us to wonder that the bones or\r\nstone weapons of the era of the Elephas meridionalis have failed to come\r\nto light. If any such lie hid in those strata, and should hereafter be\r\nrevealed to us, they would carry back the antiquity of Man to a distance\r\nof time probably more than twice as great as that which separates\r\nour era from that of the most ancient of the tool-bearing gravels yet\r\ndiscovered in Picardy, or elsewhere. But even then the reader will\r\nperceive that the age of Man, though pre-glacial, would be so modern\r\nin the great geological calendar, as given in Chapter 1, that he would\r\nscarcely date so far back as the commencement of the Pleistocene period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. -- CHRONOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD AND THE\r\nEARLIEST SIGNS OF MAN'S APPEARANCE IN EUROPE.\r\n\r\n  Chronological Relations of the Close of the Glacial Period and\r\n     the earliest geological Signs of the Appearance of Man.\r\n  Effects of Glaciers and Icebergs in polishing and scoring Rocks.\r\n  Scandinavia once encrusted with Ice like Greenland.\r\n  Outward Movement of Continental Ice in Greenland.\r\n  Mild Climate of Greenland in the Miocene Period.\r\n  Erratics of Recent Period in Sweden.\r\n  Glacial State of Sweden in the Pleistocene Period.\r\n  Scotland formerly encrusted with Ice.\r\n  Its subsequent Submergence and Re-elevation.\r\n  Latest Changes produced by Glaciers in Scotland.\r\n  Remains of the Mammoth and Reindeer in Scotch Boulder Clay.\r\n  Parallel Roads of Glen Roy formed in Glacier Lakes.\r\n  Comparatively modern Date of these Shelves.\r\n\r\nThe chronological relations of the human and glacial periods were\r\nfrequently alluded to in the last chapter, and the sections obtained\r\nnear Bedford, and at Hoxne, in Suffolk, and a general view of the\r\nNorfolk cliffs, have taught us that the earliest signs of Man's\r\nappearance in the British isles, hitherto detected, are of post-glacial\r\ndate. We may now therefore inquire whether the peopling of Europe by\r\nthe human race and by the mammoth and other mammalia now extinct, was\r\nbrought about during the concluding phases of the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may be impossible in the present state of our knowledge to\r\ncome to a positive conclusion on this head, I know of no inquiry better\r\nfitted to clear up our views respecting the geological state of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere at the time when the fabricators of the flint\r\nimplements of the Amiens type flourished. I shall therefore now proceed\r\nto consider the chronological relations of that ancient people with\r\nthe final retreat of the glaciers from the mountains of Scandinavia,\r\nScotland, Wales, and Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERFICIAL MARKINGS AND DEPOSITS LEFT BY GLACIERS AND ICEBERGS.\r\n\r\nIn order fully to discuss this question, I must begin by referring\r\nto some of the newest theoretical opinions entertained on the glacial\r\nquestion. When treating of this subject in the \"Principles of Geology,\"\r\nchapter 15, and in the \"Manual (or Elements) of Geology,\" chapter 11, I\r\nhave stated that the whole mass of the ice in a glacier is in constant\r\nmotion, and that the blocks of stone detached from boundary precipices,\r\nand the mud and sand swept down by avalanches of snow, or by rain from\r\nthe surrounding heights, are lodged upon the surface and slowly borne\r\nalong in lengthened mounds, called in Switzerland moraines. These\r\naccumulations of rocky fragments and detrital matter are left at the\r\ntermination of the glacier, where it melts in a confused heap called the\r\n\"terminal moraine,\" which is unstratified, because all the blocks, large\r\nand small, as well as the sand and the finest mud, are carried to\r\nequal distances and quietly deposited in a confused mass without being\r\nsubjected to the sorting power of running water, which would convey the\r\nfiner materials farther than the coarser ones, and would produce, as the\r\nstrength of the current varied from time to time in the same place, a\r\nstratified arrangement.\r\n\r\nIn those regions where glaciers reach the sea, and where large masses of\r\nice break off and float away, moraines, such as I have just alluded to,\r\nmay be transported to indefinite distances, and may be deposited on the\r\nbottom of the sea wherever the ice happens to melt. If the liquefaction\r\ntake place when the berg has run aground and is stationary, and if there\r\nbe no current, the heap of angular and rounded stones, mixed with sand\r\nand mud, may fall to the bottom in an unstratified form called \"till\" in\r\nScotland, and which has been shown in the last chapter to abound in the\r\nNorfolk cliffs; but should the action of a current intervene at certain\r\npoints or at certain seasons, then the materials will be sorted as they\r\nfall, and arranged in layers according to their relative weight and\r\nsize. Hence there will be passages from till to stratified clay, gravel,\r\nand sand.\r\n\r\nSome of the blocks of stone with which the surfaces of glaciers are\r\nloaded, falling occasionally through fissures in the ice, get fixed and\r\nfrozen into the bottom of the moving mass, and are pushed along under\r\nit. In this position, being subjected to great pressure, they scoop\r\nout long rectilinear furrows or grooves parallel to each other on the\r\nsubjacent solid rock. Smaller scratches and striae are made on the\r\npolished surface by crystals or projecting edges of the hardest\r\nminerals, just as a diamond cuts glass.\r\n\r\nIn all countries the fundamental rock on which the boulder formation\r\nreposes, if it consists of granite, gneiss, marble, or other hard stone\r\ncapable of permanently retaining any superficial markings which may have\r\nbeen imprinted upon it, is smoothed or polished, and exhibits parallel\r\nstriae and furrows having a determinate direction. This prevailing\r\ndirection, both in Europe and North America, is evidently connected with\r\nthe course taken by the erratic blocks in the same district, and is\r\nvery commonly from north to south, or if it be twenty or thirty or more\r\ndegrees to the east or west of north, still always corresponds to the\r\ndirection in which the large angular and rounded stones have travelled.\r\nThese stones themselves also are often furrowed and scratched on more\r\nthan one side, like those already spoken of as occurring in the glacial\r\ndrift of Bedford, and in that of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nWhen we contemplate the area which is now exposed to the abrading action\r\nof ice, or which is the receptacle of moraine matter thrown down from\r\nmelting glaciers or bergs, we at once perceive that the submarine area\r\nis the most extensive of the two. The number of large icebergs\r\nwhich float annually to great distances in the northern and southern\r\nhemispheres is extremely great, and the quantity of stone and mud which\r\nthey carry about with them enormous. Some floating islands of ice have\r\nbeen met with from 2 to 5 miles in length, and from 100 to 225 feet in\r\nheight above water, the submerged portion, according to the weight\r\nof ice relatively to sea water, being from six to eight times more\r\nconsiderable than the part which is visible. Such masses, when they run\r\naground on the bottom of the sea, must exert a prodigious mechanical\r\npower, and may polish and groove the subjacent rocks after the manner of\r\nglaciers on the land. Hence there will often be no small difficulty\r\nin distinguishing between the effects of the submarine and supramarine\r\nagency of ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCANDINAVIA ONCE COVERED WITH ICE, AND A CENTRE OF DISPERSION OF\r\nERRATICS.\r\n\r\nIn the north of Europe, along the borders of the Baltic, where the\r\nboulder formation is continuous for hundreds of miles east and west, it\r\nhas been long known that the erratic blocks, often of very large size,\r\nare of northern origin. Some of them have come from Norway and Sweden,\r\nothers from Finland, and their present distribution implies that they\r\nwere carried southwards, for a part at least of their way, by floating\r\nice, at a time when much of the area over which they are scattered was\r\nunder water. But it appears from the observations of Boetlingk, in\r\n1840, and those of more recent inquirers, that while many blocks have\r\ntravelled to the south, others have been carried northwards, or to the\r\nshores of the Polar Sea, and others north-eastward, or to those of\r\nthe White Sea. In fact, they have wandered towards all points of\r\nthe compass, from the mountains of Scandinavia as a centre, and the\r\nrectilinear furrows imprinted by them on the polished surfaces of the\r\nmountains where the rocks are hard enough to retain such markings,\r\nradiate in all directions, or point outwards from the highest land, in a\r\nmanner corresponding to the course of the erratics above mentioned.*\r\n\r\n     (* Sir R.I. Murchison, in his \"Russia and the Ural\r\n     Mountains\" (1845) has indicated on a map not only the\r\n     southern limits of the Scandinavian drift, but by arrows the\r\n     direction in which \"it proceeded eccentrically from a common\r\n     central region.\")\r\n\r\nBefore the glacial theory was adopted, the Swedish and Norwegian\r\ngeologists speculated on a great flood, or the sudden rush of an\r\nenormous body of water charged with mud and stones, descending from the\r\ncentral heights or watershed into the adjoining lower lands. The erratic\r\nblocks were supposed in their downward passage to have smoothed and\r\nstriated the rock surfaces over which they were forced along.\r\n\r\nIt would be a waste of time, in the present state of science, to\r\ncontrovert this hypothesis, as it is now admitted that even if the rush\r\nof a diluvial current, invented for the occasion and wholly without\r\nanalogy in the known course of nature, be granted, it would be\r\ninadequate to explain the uniformity, parallelism, persistency,\r\nand rectilinearity of the so-called glacial furrows. It is moreover\r\nascertained that heavy masses of rock, not fixed in ice, and moving as\r\nfreely as they do when simply swept along by a muddy current, do not\r\ngive rise to such scratches and furrows.\r\n\r\nM. Kjerulf of Christiania, in a paper lately communicated to the\r\nGeological Society of Berlin,* has objected, and perhaps with reason,\r\nto what he considers the undue extent to which I have, in some of\r\nmy writings, supposed the mountains of northern Europe, to have been\r\nsubmerged during the glacial period.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Zeitschrift der Deutschen Geologischen Gesellschaft\"\r\n     Berlin 1860.)\r\n\r\nHe remarks that the signs of glacial action on the Scandinavian\r\nmountains ascend as high as 6000 feet, whereas fossil marine shells of\r\nthe same period never reach elevations exceeding 600 feet. The land, he\r\nsays, may have been much higher than it now is, but it has evidently not\r\nbeen much lower since the commencement of the glacial period, or marine\r\nshells would be traceable to more elevated points. In regard to the\r\nabsence of marine shells, I shall point out in the sequel how small is\r\nthe dependence we can place on this kind of negative evidence, if we\r\ndesire to test by it the extent to which the land has been submerged.\r\nI cannot therefore consent to limit the probable depression and\r\nre-elevation of Scandinavia to 600 feet. But that the larger part of\r\nthe glaciation of that country has been supramarine, I am willing to\r\nconcede. In support of this view M. Kjerulf observes that the direction\r\nof the furrows and striae, produced by glacial abrasion, neither\r\nconforms to a general movement of floating ice from the Polar regions,\r\nnor to the shape of the existing valleys, as it would do if it had been\r\ncaused by independent glaciers generated in the higher valleys after\r\nthe land had acquired its actual shape. Their general arrangement and\r\napparent irregularities are, he contends, much more in accordance with\r\nthe hypothesis of there having been at one time a universal covering\r\nof ice over the whole of Norway and Sweden, like that now existing in\r\nGreenland, which, being annually recruited by fresh falls of snow,\r\nwas continually pressing outwards and downwards to the coast and lower\r\nregions, after crossing many of the lower ridges, and having no relation\r\nto the minor depressions, which were all choked up with ice and reduced\r\nto one uniform level.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL ICE OF GREENLAND.\r\n\r\nIn support of this view, he appeals to the admirable description of\r\nthe continental ice of Greenland, lately published by Dr. H. Rink of\r\nCopenhagen,* who resided three or four years in the Danish settlements\r\nin Baffin's Bay, on the west coast of Greenland, between latitudes 69\r\nand 73 degrees north.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Journal of Royal Geographical Society\" volume 23 1853\r\n     page 145.)\r\n\r\n\"In that country, the land,\" says Dr. Rink, \"may be divided into two\r\nregions, the 'inland' and the 'outskirts.' The 'inland,' which is 800\r\nmiles from west to east, and of much greater length from north to south,\r\nis a vast unknown continent, buried under one continuous and colossal\r\nmass of permanent ice, which is always moving seaward, but a small\r\nproportion only of it in an easterly direction, since nearly the\r\nwhole descends towards Baffin's Bay.\" At the heads of the fjords which\r\nintersect the coast, the ice is seen to rise somewhat abruptly from the\r\nlevel of the sea to the height of 2000 feet, beyond which the ice of\r\nthe interior rises continuously as far as the eye can reach, and to\r\nan unknown altitude. All minor ridges and valleys are levelled and\r\nconcealed, but here and there steep mountains protrude abruptly from the\r\nicy slope, and a few superficial lines of stones or moraines are visible\r\nat seasons when no recent snow has fallen. [23]\r\n\r\nAlthough all the ice is moving seaward, the greatest quantity is\r\ndischarged at the heads of certain large fjords, usually about 4 miles\r\nwide, which, if the climate were milder, would be the outlet of as many\r\ngreat rivers. Through these the ice is now protruded in huge blocks,\r\nseveral miles wide, and from 1000 to 1500 feet in height or thickness.\r\nWhen these masses reach the fjords, they do not melt or break up into\r\nfragments, but continue their course in a solid form in the salt water,\r\ngrating along the rocky bottom, which they must polish and score at\r\ndepths of hundreds and even of more than 1000 feet. At length, when\r\nthere is water enough to float them, huge portions, having broken off,\r\nfill Baffin's Bay with icebergs of a size exceeding any which could\r\nbe produced by ordinary valley glaciers. Stones, sand, and mud are\r\nsometimes included in these bergs which float down Baffin's Bay. At some\r\npoints, where the ice of the interior of Greenland reaches the coast,\r\nDr. Rink saw mighty springs of clayey water issuing from under the edge\r\nof the ice even in winter, showing the grinding action of the glacial\r\nmass mixed with sand on the subjacent surface of the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe \"outskirts,\" where the Danish colonies are stationed, consist of\r\nnumerous islands, of which Disco island is the largest in latitude 70\r\ndegrees north, and of many peninsulas, with fjords from 50 to 100 miles\r\nlong, running into the land, and through which the ice above alluded\r\nto passes on its way to the bay. This area is 30, 000 square miles in\r\nextent, and contains in it some mountains 4000 feet to 5000 feet high.\r\nThe perpetual snow usually begins at the height of 2000 feet, below\r\nwhich level the land is for the most part free from snow between June\r\nand August, and supports a vegetation of several hundred species of\r\nflowering plants, which ripen their seeds before the winter. There\r\nare even some places where phanerogamous plants have been found at an\r\nelevation of 4500 feet; a fact which, when we reflect on the immediate\r\nvicinity of so large and lofty a region of continental ice in the same\r\nlatitude, well deserves the attention of the geologist, who should\r\nalso bear in mind, that while the Danes are settled to the west in the\r\n\"outskirts,\" there exists, due east of the most southern portion of this\r\nice-covered continent, at the distance of about 1200 miles, the home of\r\nthe Laplanders with their reindeer, bears, wolves, seals, walruses, and\r\nwhales. If, therefore, there are geological grounds for suspecting that\r\nScandinavia or Scotland or Wales was ever in the same glacial condition\r\nas Greenland now is, we must not imagine that the contemporaneous\r\nfauna and flora were everywhere poor and stunted, or that they may\r\nnot, especially at the distance of a few hundred miles in a SOUTHWARD\r\ndirection, have been very luxuriant. [24]\r\n\r\nAnother series of observations made by Captain Graah, during a survey of\r\nGreenland between 1823 and 1829, and by Dr. Pingel in 1830-32, adds not\r\na little to the geological interest of the \"outskirts,\" in their bearing\r\non glacial phenomena of ancient date. Those Danish investigators, with\r\none of whom, Dr. Pingel, I conversed at Copenhagen in 1834, ascertained\r\nthat the whole coast from latitude 60 to about 70 degrees north has been\r\nsubsiding for the last four centuries, so that some ancient piles driven\r\ninto the beach to support the boats of the settlers have been gradually\r\nsubmerged, and wooden buildings have had to be repeatedly shifted\r\nfarther inland.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles of Geology\" chapter 30.)\r\n\r\nIn Norway and Sweden, instead of such a subsiding movement, the land is\r\nslowly rising; but we have only to suppose that formerly, when it was\r\ncovered like Greenland with continental ice, it sank at the rate of\r\nseveral feet in a century, and we shall be able to explain why marine\r\ndeposits are found above the level of the sea, and why these generally\r\noverlie polished and striated surfaces of rock.\r\n\r\nWe know that Greenland was not always covered with snow and ice, for\r\nwhen we examine the Tertiary strata of Disco Island (of the Upper\r\nMiocene period) we discover there a multitude of fossil plants, which\r\ndemonstrate that, like many other parts of the arctic regions, it\r\nformerly enjoyed a mild and genial climate. Among the fossils brought\r\nfrom that island, latitude 70 degrees north, Professor Heer has\r\nrecognised Sequoia Langsdorfii, a coniferous species which flourished\r\nthroughout a great part of Europe in the Miocene period, and is very\r\nclosely allied to the living Sequoia sempervirens of California. The\r\nsame plant has been found fossil by Sir John Richardson within the\r\narctic circle, far to the west on the Mackenzie River, near the entrance\r\nof Bear River, also by some Danish naturalists in Iceland to the east.\r\nThe Icelandic surturbrand, or lignite, of this age has also yielded\r\na rich harvest of plants, more than thirty-one of them, according to\r\nSteenstrup and Heer, in a good state of preservation, and no less than\r\nfifteen specifically identical with Miocene plants of Europe. Thirteen\r\nof the number are arborescent; and amongst others is a tulip-tree\r\n(Liriodendron), with its fruit and characteristic leaves, a plane\r\n(Platanus), a walnut, and a vine, affording unmistakable evidence of\r\na climate in the parallel of the arctic circle which precludes the\r\nsupposition of glaciers then existing in the neighbourhood, still less\r\nany general crust of continental ice, like that of Greenland.*\r\n\r\n     (* Heer, \"Recherches sur la Vegetation du Pays tertiaire\"\r\n     etc. 1861 page 178.)\r\n\r\nAs the older Pliocene flora of the Tertiary strata of Italy, like the\r\nshells of the Coralline Crag, before adverted to, Chapter 12, indicate\r\na temperature milder than that now prevailing in Europe, though not\r\nso warm as that of the Upper Miocene period, it is probable that the\r\naccumulation of snow and glaciers on the mountains and valleys of\r\nGreenland did not begin till after the commencement of the Pliocene\r\nperiod, and may not have reached its maximum until the close of that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nNorway and Sweden appear to have passed through all the successive\r\nphases of glaciation which Greenland has experienced, and others which\r\nthat country will one day undergo, if the climate which it formerly\r\nenjoyed should ever be restored to it. There must have been first a\r\nperiod of separate glaciers in Scandinavia, then a Greenlandic state of\r\ncontinental ice, and thirdly, when that diminished, a second period of\r\nenormous separate glaciers filling many a valley now wooded with fir\r\nand birch. Lastly, under the influence of the Gulf Stream, and various\r\nchanges in the height and extent of land in the arctic circle, a melting\r\nof nearly all the permanent ice between latitudes 60 and 70 north,\r\ncorresponding to the parallels of the continental ice of Greenland,\r\nhas occurred, so that we have now to go farther north than latitude 70\r\ndegrees before we encounter any glacier coming down to the sea coast.\r\nAmong other signs of the last retreat of the extinct glaciers, Kjerulf\r\nand other authors describe large transverse moraines left in many of the\r\nNorwegian and Swedish glens.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE HUMAN AND GLACIAL PERIODS IN SWEDEN.\r\n\r\nWe may now consider whether any, and what part, of these changes in\r\nScandinavia may have been witnessed by Man. In Sweden, in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of Upsala, I observed, in 1834, a ridge of stratified\r\nsand and gravel, in the midst of which occurs a layer of marl, evidently\r\nformed originally at the bottom of the Baltic, by the slow growth of\r\nthe mussel, cockle, and other marine shells of living species intermixed\r\nwith some proper to fresh water. The marine shells are all of dwarfish\r\nsize, like those now inhabiting the brackish waters of the Baltic; and\r\nthe marl, in which myriads of them are embedded, is now raised more than\r\n100 feet above the level of the Gulf of Bothnia. Upon the top of this\r\nridge (one of those called osars in Sweden) repose several huge erratics\r\nconsisting of gneiss, for the most part unrounded, from 9 to 16 feet in\r\ndiameter, and which must have been brought into their present position\r\nsince the time when the neighbouring gulf was already characterised by\r\nits peculiar fauna. Here, therefore, we have proof that the transport of\r\nerratics continued to take place, not merely when the sea was inhabited\r\nby the existing Testacea, but when the north of Europe had already\r\nassumed that remarkable feature of its physical geography, which\r\nseparates the Baltic from the North Sea, and causes the Gulf of Bothnia\r\nto have only one-fourth of the saltness belonging to the ocean.\r\n\r\nI cannot doubt that these large erratics of Upsala were brought into\r\ntheir present position during the Recent period, not only because of\r\ntheir moderate elevation above the sea-level in a country where the land\r\nis now rising every century, but because I observed signs of a great\r\noscillation of level which had taken place at Sodertelje, south of\r\nStockholm (about 45 miles distant from Upsala), after the country had\r\nbeen inhabited by Man. I described, in the \"Philosophical Transactions\"\r\nfor 1835, the section there laid open in digging a level in 1819,\r\nwhich showed that a subsidence followed by a re-elevation of land, each\r\nmovement amounting to more than 60 feet, had occurred since the time\r\nwhen a rude hut had been built on the ancient shore. The wooden frame\r\nof the hut, with a ring of hearthstones on the floor, and much charcoal,\r\nwere found, and over them marine strata, more than 60 feet thick,\r\ncontaining the dwarf variety of Mytilus edulis, and other brackish-water\r\nshells of the Bothnian Gulf. Some vessels put together with wooden pegs,\r\nof anterior date to the use of metals, were also embedded in parts of\r\nthe same marine formation, which has since been raised, so that the\r\nupper beds are more than 60 feet above the sea-level, the hut being thus\r\nrestored to about its original position relatively to the sea.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the account of the Danish kitchen-middens of the Recent\r\nperiod that even at the comparatively late period of their origin the\r\nwaters of the Baltic had been rendered more salt than they are now. The\r\nUpsala erratics may belong to nearly the same era as these. But were\r\nwe to go back to a long antecedent epoch, or to that of the Belgian and\r\nBritish caves with their extinct animals, and the signs they afford of a\r\nstate of physical geography departing widely from the present, or to the\r\nera of the implement-bearing alluvium of St. Acheul, we might expect\r\nto find Scandinavia overwhelmed with glaciers, and the country\r\nuninhabitable by Man. At a much remoter period the same country was in\r\nthe state in which Greenland now is, overspread with one uninterrupted\r\ncoating of continental ice, which has left its peculiar markings on the\r\nhighest mountains. This period, probably anterior to the earliest traces\r\nyet brought to light of the human race, may have coincided with the\r\nsubmergence of England, and the accumulation of the boulder-clay of\r\nNorfolk, Suffolk, and Bedfordshire, before mentioned. It has already\r\nbeen stated that the syenite and some other rocks of the Norfolk till\r\nseem to have come from Scandinavia, and there is no era when icebergs\r\nare so likely to have floated them so far south as when the whole of\r\nSweden and Norway were enveloped in a massive crust of ice; a state\r\nof things the existence of which is deduced from the direction of the\r\nglacial furrows, and their frequent unconformity to the shape of the\r\nminor valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIAL PERIOD IN SCOTLAND [25].\r\n\r\nProfessor Agassiz, after his tour in Scotland in 1840, announced\r\nthe opinion that erratic blocks had been dispersed from the Scottish\r\nmountains as from an independent centre, and that the capping of ice had\r\nbeen of extraordinary thickness.*\r\n\r\n     (* Agassiz, \"Proceedings of the Geological Society\" 1840 and\r\n     \"Edinburgh Philosophical Journal\" 49 page 79.)\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Chambers, after visiting Norway and Sweden, and comparing the\r\nsigns of glacial action observed there with similar appearances in the\r\nGrampians, came to the conclusion that the Highlands both of Scandinavia\r\nand Scotland had once been \"moulded in ice,\" and that the outward and\r\ndownward movement and pressure of the frozen mass had not only smoothed,\r\npolished, and scratched the rocks, but had, in the course of ages,\r\ndeepened and widened the valleys, and produced much of that denudation\r\nwhich has commonly been ascribed exclusively to aqueous action. The\r\nglaciation of the Scotch mountains was traced by him to the height of at\r\nleast 3000 feet.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Ancient Sea Margins\" Edinburgh 1848. Glacial Phenomena\r\n     \"Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal\" April 1853 and January\r\n     1855.)\r\n\r\nMr. T.F. Jamieson, of Ellon, in Aberdeenshire, has recently brought\r\nforward an additional body of facts in support of this theory. According\r\nto him the Grampians were at the period of extreme cold enveloped \"in\r\none great winding sheet of snow and ice,\" which reached everywhere to\r\nthe coast-line, the land being then more elevated than it is now. He\r\ndescribes the glacial furrows sculptured on the solid rocks as pointing\r\nin Aberdeenshire to the south-east, those of the valley of the Forth at\r\nEdinburgh, from west to east, and higher up the same valley at Stirling,\r\nfrom north-west to south-east, as they should do if the ice had followed\r\nthe lines of what is now the principal drainage. The observations of Sir\r\nJames Hall, Mr. Maclaren, Mr. Chambers, and Dr. Fleming, are cited by\r\nhim in confirmation of this arrangement of the glacial markings, while\r\nin Sutherland and Ross-shire he shows that the glacial furrows along the\r\nnorth coast point northwards, and in Argyleshire westwards, always in\r\naccordance with the direction of the principal glens and fjords.\r\n\r\nAnother argument is also adduced by him in proof of the ice having\r\nexerted its mechanical force in a direction from the higher and more\r\ninland country to the lower region and sea-coast. Isolated hills and\r\nminor prominences of rock are often polished and striated on the land\r\nside, while they remain rough and jagged on the side fronting the sea.\r\nThis may be seen both on the east and west coast. Mention is also\r\nmade of blocks of granite which have travelled from south to north\r\nin Aberdeenshire, of which there would have been no examples had the\r\nerratics been all brought by floating ice from the arctic regions\r\nwhen Scotland was submerged. It is also urged against the doctrine of\r\nattributing the general glaciation to submergence, that the glacial\r\ngrooves, instead of radiating as they do from a centre, would, if they\r\nhad been due to ice coming from the north, have been parallel to the\r\ncoast-line, to which they are now often almost at right angles. The\r\nargument, moreover, which formerly had most weight in favour of floating\r\nice, namely, that it explained why so many of the stones did not conform\r\nto the contour and direction of the minor hills and valleys, is now\r\nbrought forward, and with no small effect, in favour of the doctrine of\r\ncontinental ice on the Greenlandic scale, which, after levelling up the\r\nlesser inequalities, would occasionally flow in mighty ice-currents, in\r\ndirections often at a high angle to the smaller ridges and glens.\r\n\r\nThe application to Scandinavia and Scotland of this theory makes it\r\nnecessary to reconsider the validity of the proofs formerly relied on\r\nas establishing the submergence of a great part of Scotland beneath\r\nthe sea, at some period subsequent to the commencement of the glacial\r\nperiod. In all cases where marine shells overlie till, or rest on\r\npolished and striated surfaces of rock, the evidence of the land having\r\nbeen under water, and having been since upheaved, remains unshaken; but\r\nthis special proof rarely extends to heights exceeding 500 feet. In the\r\nbasin of the Clyde we have already seen that Recent strata occur 25 feet\r\nabove the sea-level, with existing species of marine testacea, and with\r\nburied canoes, and other works of art. At the higher level of 50\r\nfeet occurs the well-known raised beach of the western coast, which,\r\naccording to Mr. Jamieson, contains, near Fort William and on Loch Fyne\r\nand elsewhere, an assemblage of shells implying a colder climate than\r\nthat of the 25-foot terrace, or that of the present sea; just as, in the\r\nvalley of the Somme, the higher-level gravels are supposed to belong to\r\na colder period than the lower ones, and still more decidedly than that\r\nof the present era. At still greater elevations, older beds containing\r\na still more arctic group of shells have been observed at Airdrie, 14\r\nmiles south-east of Glasgow, 524 feet above the level of the sea. They\r\nwere embedded in stratified clays, with the unstratified boulder till\r\nboth above and below them, and in the overlying unstratified drift were\r\nsome boulders of granite which must have come from distances of 60 miles\r\nat the least.*\r\n\r\n     (* Smith of Jordanhill, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological\r\n     Society\" volume 6 1850 page 387.)\r\n\r\nThe presence of Tellina calcarea, and several other northern shells,\r\nimplies a climate colder than that of the present Scottish seas. In the\r\nnorth of Scotland, marine shells have been found in deposits of the same\r\nage in Caithness and in Aberdeenshire at heights of 250 feet, and on the\r\nshores of the Moray Firth, as at Gamrie in Banff, at an elevation of 350\r\nfeet; and the stratified sands and beds of pebbles which belong to the\r\nsame formation ascend still higher--to heights of 500 feet at least.*\r\n\r\n     (* Prestwich, \"Proceedings of the Geological Society\" volume\r\n     2 page 545; Jamieson, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological\r\n     Society\" volume 16 1860.)\r\n\r\nAt much greater heights, stratified masses of drift occur in which\r\nhitherto no organic remains, whether of marine or freshwater animals,\r\nhave ever been found. It is still an undecided question whether the\r\norigin of all such deposits in the Grampians can be explained without\r\nthe intervention of the sea. One of the most conspicuous examples has\r\nbeen described by Mr. Jamieson as resting on the flank of a hill called\r\nMeal Uaine, in Perthshire, on the east side of the valley of the Tummel,\r\njust below Killiecrankie. It consists of perfectly horizontal strata,\r\nthe lowest portion of them 300 feet above the river and 600 feet above\r\nthe sea. From this elevation to an altitude of nearly 1200 feet the\r\nsame series of strata is traceable, continuously, up the slope of the\r\nmountain, and some patches are seen here and there even as high as 1550\r\nfeet above the sea. They are made up in great part of finely laminated\r\nsilt, alternating with coarser materials, through which stones from 4 to\r\n5 feet in length are scattered. These large boulders, and some smaller\r\nones, are polished on one or more sides, and marked with glacial striae.\r\nThe subjacent rocks, also, of gneiss, mica slate, and quartz, are\r\neverywhere grooved and polished as if by the passage of a glacier.*\r\n\r\n     (* Jamieson, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\"\r\n     volume 16 1860 page 360.)\r\n\r\nAt one spot a vertical thickness of 130 feet of this series of strata is\r\nexposed to view by a mountain torrent, and in all more than 2000 layers\r\nof clay, sand, and gravel were counted, the whole evidently accumulated\r\nunder water. Some beds consist of an impalpable mud, like putty,\r\napparently derived from the grinding down of felspar, and resembling the\r\nmud produced by the grinding action of modern glaciers.\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson, when he first gave an account of this drift, inferred, in\r\nspite of the absence of marine shells, that it implied the submergence\r\nof Scotland beneath the ocean after the commencement of the glacial\r\nperiod, or after the era of continental ice indicated by the subjacent\r\nfloor of polished and grooved rock. This conclusion would require\r\na submergence of the land as far up as 1550 feet above the present\r\nsea-level, after which a great re-upheaval must have occurred. But the\r\nsame author, having lately revisited the valley of the Tummel, suggests\r\nanother possible, and I think probable, explanation of the same\r\nphenomena. The stratified drift in question is situated in a deep\r\ndepression between two buttresses of rock, and if an enormous glacier be\r\nsupposed to have once filled the valley of the Tummel to the height\r\nof the stratified drift, it may have dammed up the mouth of a mountain\r\ntorrent by a transverse barrier, giving rise to a deep pond, in which\r\nbeds of clay and sand brought down by the waters of the torrent were\r\ndeposited. Charpentier in his work on the Swiss glaciers has described\r\nmany such receptacles of stratified matter now in progress, and due\r\nto such blockages, and he has pointed out the remnants of ancient and\r\nsimilar formations left by extinct glaciers of an earlier epoch. He\r\nspecially notices that angular stones of various dimensions, often\r\npolished and striated, which rest on the glacier and are let fall when\r\nthe torrent undermines the side of the moving ice, descend into the\r\nsmall lake and become interstratified with the gravel and fine sediment\r\nbrought down by the torrent into the same.*\r\n\r\n     (* Charpentier, \"Essai sur les Glaciers\" page 63 1841.)\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the former sojourn of the sea upon the land after the\r\ncommencement of the glacial period was formerly inferred from the height\r\nto which erratic blocks derived from distant regions could be traced,\r\nbesides the want of conformity in the glacial furrows to the present\r\ncontours of many of the valleys. Some of these phenomena may now, as we\r\nhave seen, be accounted for by assuming that there was once a crust of\r\nice resembling that now covering Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe Grampians in Forfarshire and in Perthshire are from 3000 to\r\n4000 feet high. To the southward lies the broad and deep valley of\r\nStrathmore, and to the south of this again rise the Sidlaw Hills to the\r\nheight of 1500 feet and upwards. On the highest summits of this chain,\r\nformed of sandstone and shale, and at various elevations, I have\r\nobserved huge angular fragments of mica-schist, some 3 and others 15\r\nfeet in diameter, which have been conveyed for a distance of at least\r\n15 miles from the nearest Grampian rocks from which they could have been\r\ndetached. Others have been left strewed over the bottom of the large\r\nintervening vale of Strathmore.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Proceedings of the Geological Society\" volume 3 page\r\n     344.)\r\n\r\nIt may be argued that the transportation of such blocks may have been\r\ndue not to floating ice, but to a period when Strathmore was filled up\r\nwith land ice, a current of which extended from the Perthshire Highlands\r\nto the summit of the Sidlaw Hills, and the total absence of marine or\r\nfreshwater shells from all deposits, stratified or unstratified, which\r\nhave any connection with these erratics in Forfarshire and Perthshire\r\nmay be thought to favour such a theory.\r\n\r\nBut the same mode of transport can scarcely be imagined for those\r\nfragments of mica-schist, one of them weighing from 8 to 10 tons, which\r\nwere observed much farther south by Mr. Maclaren on the Pentland Hills,\r\nnear Edinburgh, at the height of 1100 feet above the sea, the nearest\r\nmountain composed of this formation being 50 miles distant.*\r\n\r\n     (* Maclaren, \"Geology of Fife\" etc. page 220.)\r\n\r\nOn the same hills, also, at all elevations, stratified gravels occur\r\nwhich, although devoid of shells, it seems hardly possible to refer to\r\nany but a marine origin.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am willing, therefore, to concede that the glaciation of the\r\nScotch mountains, at elevations exceeding 2000 feet, may be explained\r\nby land ice, it seems difficult not to embrace the conclusion that a\r\nsubsidence took place not merely of 500 or 600 feet, as demonstrated by\r\nthe marine shells, but to a much greater amount, as shown by the present\r\nposition of erratics and some patches of stratified drift. The absence\r\nof marine shells at greater heights than 525 feet above the sea, will be\r\ntreated of in a future chapter. It may in part, perhaps, be ascribed\r\nto the action of glaciers, which swept out marine strata from all the\r\nhigher valleys, after the re-emergence of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATEST CHANGES PRODUCED BY GLACIERS IN SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\nWe may next consider the state of Scotland after its emergence from the\r\nglacial sea, when we cannot fail to be approaching the time when Man\r\nco-existed with the mammoth and other mammalia now extinct. In a paper\r\nwhich I published in 1840, on the ancient glaciers of Forfarshire, I\r\nendeavoured to show that some of these existed after the mountains and\r\nglens had acquired precisely their present shape,* and had left moraines\r\neven in the minor valleys, just where they would now leave them were the\r\nsnow and ice again to gain ground.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Proceedings of the Geological Society\" volume 3 page\r\n     337.)\r\n\r\nI described also one remarkable transverse mound, evidently the terminal\r\nmoraine of a retreating glacier, which crosses the valley of the South\r\nEsk, a few miles above the point where it issues from the Grampians, and\r\nabout 6 miles below the Kirktown of Clova. Its central part, at a place\r\ncalled Glenarm, is 800 feet above the level of the sea. The valley is\r\nabout half a mile broad, and is bounded by steep and lofty mountains,\r\nbut immediately above the transverse barrier it expands into a wide\r\nalluvial plain, several miles broad, which has evidently once been a\r\nlake. The barrier itself, about 150 feet high, consists in its lower\r\npart of till with boulders, 50 feet thick, precisely resembling the\r\nmoraine of a Swiss glacier, above which there is a mass of stratified\r\nsand, varying in thickness from 50 to 100 feet, which has the appearance\r\nof consisting of the materials of the moraine rearranged in a stratified\r\nform, possibly by the waters of a glacier lake. The structure of the\r\nbarrier has been laid open by the Esk, which has cut through it a deep\r\npassage about 400 yards wide.\r\n\r\nI have also given an account of another striking feature in the physical\r\ngeography of Perthshire and Forfarshire, which I consider to belong\r\nto the same period; namely, a continuous zone of boulder clay, forming\r\nridges and mounds from 50 to 70 feet high (the upper part of the mounds\r\nusually stratified), enclosing numerous lakes, some of them several\r\nmiles long, and many ponds and swamps filled with shell-marl and peat.\r\nThis band of till, with Grampian boulders and associated river-gravel,\r\nmay be traced continuously for a distance of 34 miles, with a width of\r\n3 1/2 miles, from near Dunkeld, by Coupar, to the south of Blairgowrie,\r\nthen through the lowest part of Strathmore, and afterwards in a straight\r\nline through the greatest depression in the Sidlaw Hills, from Forfar to\r\nLunan Bay.\r\n\r\nAlthough no great river now takes its course through this line of\r\nancient lakes, moraines, and river gravel, yet it evidently marks\r\nan ancient line by which, first, a great glacier descended from the\r\nmountains to the sea, and by which, secondly, at a later period, the\r\nprincipal water drainage of this country was effected. The subsequent\r\nmodification in geography is comparable in amount to that which has\r\ntaken place since the higher level gravels of the valley of the Somme\r\nwere formed, or since the Belgian caves were filled with mud and\r\nbone-breccia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 35. Oval And Flattish Pebbles In Deserted Channels]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 35. OVAL AND FLATTISH PEBBLES IN DESERTED CHANNELS.)\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson has remarked, in reference to this and some other extinct\r\nriver-channels of corresponding date, that we have the means of\r\nascertaining the direction in which the waters flowed by observing the\r\narrangement of the oval and flattish pebbles in their deserted channels;\r\nfor in the bed of a fast-flowing river such pebbles are seen to dip\r\ntowards the current, as represented in Figure 35, such being the\r\nposition of greatest resistance to the stream.*\r\n\r\n     (* Jamieson, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\"\r\n     volume 16 1860 page 349.)\r\n\r\nIf this be admitted, it follows that the higher or mountainous country\r\nbore the same relation to the lower lands, at the time when a great\r\nriver passed through this chain of lakes, as it does at present.\r\n\r\nWe also seem to have a test of the comparatively modern origin of the\r\nmounds of till which surround the above-mentioned chain of lakes\r\n(of which that of Forfar is one), in the species of organic remains\r\ncontained in the shell-marl deposited at their bottom. All the mammalia\r\nas well as shells are of recent species. Unfortunately, we have no\r\ninformation as to the fauna which inhabited the country at the time\r\nwhen the till itself was formed. There seem to be only three or\r\nfour instances as yet known in all Scotland of mammalia having been\r\ndiscovered in boulder clay.\r\n\r\nMr. R. Bald has recorded the circumstances under which a single\r\nelephant's tusk was found in the unstratified drift of the valley of the\r\nForth, with the minuteness which such a discovery from its rarity well\r\ndeserved. He distinguishes the boulder clay, under the name of \"the old\r\nalluvial cover,\" from that more modern alluvium, in which the whales\r\nof Airthrie, described in Chapter 3, were found. This cover he says is\r\nsometimes 160 feet thick. Having never observed any organic remains in\r\nit, he watched with curiosity and care the digging of the Union Canal\r\nbetween Edinburgh and Falkirk, which passed for no less than 28\r\nmiles almost continuously through it. Mr. Baird, the engineer who\r\nsuperintended the works, assisted in the inquiry, and at one place\r\nonly in this long section did they meet with a fossil, namely, at\r\nCliftonhall, in the valley of the Almond. It lay at a depth of between\r\n15 and 20 feet from the surface, in very stiff clay, and consisted of an\r\nelephant's tusk, 39 inches long and 13 in circumference, in so fresh\r\na state that an ivory turner purchased it and turned part of it into\r\nchessmen before it was rescued from destruction. The remainder is still\r\npreserved in the museum at Edinburgh, but by exposure to the air it has\r\nshrunk considerably.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Memoirs of the Wernerian Society\" Edinburgh volume 4\r\n     page 58.)\r\n\r\nIn 1817, two other tusks and some bones of the elephant, as we learn\r\nfrom the same authority (Mr. Bald), were met with, 3 1/2 feet long and\r\n13 inches in circumference, lying in an horizontal position, 17 feet\r\ndeep in clay, with marine shells, at Kilmaurs, in Ayrshire. The species\r\nof shells are not given.*\r\n\r\n    (* Ibid. volume 4 page 63.)\r\n\r\nIn another excavation through the Scotch boulder clay, made in digging\r\nthe Clyde and Forth Junction Railway, the antlers of a reindeer were\r\nfound at Croftamie, in Dumbartonshire, in the basin of the river\r\nEndrick, which flows into Loch Lomond. They had cut through 12 feet\r\nof till with angular and rounded stones, some of large size, and then\r\nthrough 6 feet of underlying clay, when they came upon the deer's horns,\r\n18 feet from the surface, and within a foot of the sandstone on which\r\nthe till rested. At the distance of a few yards, and in the same\r\nposition, but a foot or two deeper, were observed marine shells, Cyprina\r\nislandica, Astarte elliptica, A. compressa, Fusus antiquus, Littorina\r\nlittorea, and a Balanus. The height above the level of the sea was\r\nbetween 100 and 103 feet. The reindeer's horn was seen by Professor\r\nOwen, who considered it to be that of a young female of the large\r\nvariety, called by the Hudson's Bay trappers the caribou.\r\n\r\nThe remains of elephants, now in the museums of Glasgow and Edinburgh,\r\npurporting to come from the superficial deposits of Scotland have been\r\nreferred to Elephas primigenius. In cases where tusks alone have been\r\nfound unaccompanied by molar teeth, such specific determinations may be\r\nuncertain; but if any one specimen be correctly named, the occurrence\r\nof the mammoth and reindeer in the Scotch boulder-clay, as both these\r\nquadrupeds are known to have been contemporary with Man, favours the\r\nidea which I have already expressed, that the close of the glacial\r\nperiod in the Grampians may have coincided in time with the existence of\r\nMan in those parts of Europe where the climate was less severe, as, for\r\nexample, in the basins of the Thames, Somme, and Seine, in which the\r\nbones of many extinct mammalia are associated with flint implements of\r\nthe antique type.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARALLEL ROADS OF GLEN ROY IN SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 2. Glen Roy and Glen Spean]\r\n\r\n  (PLATE 2. VIEW OF THE MOUTHS OF GLEN ROY AND GLEN SPEAN,\r\n    BY SIR T. DICK LAUDER.\r\n   VV. Hill of Bohuntine.\r\n   VVV. Glen Roy.\r\n   V(inverted)V. Mealderry.\r\n   V. Entrance of Glen Spean\r\n   VV(superscript)V. Point of division between Glens Roy\r\n     and Spean.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps no portion of the superficial drift of Scotland can lay claim to\r\nso modern an origin on the score of the freshness of its aspect, as that\r\nwhich forms what are called the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy. If they do\r\nnot belong to the Recent epoch, they are at least posterior in date to\r\nthe present outline of mountain and glen, and to the time when every one\r\nof the smaller burns ran in their present channels, though some of them\r\nhave since been slightly deepened. The almost perfect horizontality,\r\nmoreover, of the roads, one of which is continuous for about 20 miles\r\nfrom east to west, and 12 miles from north to south, shows that since\r\nthe era of their formation no change has taken place in the relative\r\nlevels of different parts of the district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 36. Map of Glen Roy]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 36. MAP OF THE PARALLEL ROADS OF GLEN ROY OR LOCHABER.\r\n\r\n   A. five miles distant south-west from this point is\r\n     Fort William, where the Lochy joins an arm of the sea,\r\n     called Loch Eil.\r\n   Vertical lines.

Jamieson.)\r\n\r\nGlen Roy is situated in the Western Highlands, about 10 miles\r\neast-north-east of Fort William, near the western end of the great glen\r\nof Scotland, or Caledonian Canal, and near the foot of the highest of\r\nthe Grampians, Ben Nevis. (See map, Figure 36.) Throughout nearly its\r\nwhole length, a distance of more than 10 miles, three parallel roads\r\nor shelves are traced along the steep sides of the mountains, as\r\nrepresented in the annexed view, Plate 2, by the late Sir T. Dick\r\nLauder, each maintaining a perfect horizontality, and continuing at\r\nexactly the same level on the opposite sides of the glen. Seen at a\r\ndistance, they appear like ledges, or roads, cut artificially out of the\r\nsides of the hills; but when we are upon them, we can scarcely recognise\r\ntheir existence, so uneven is their surface, and so covered with\r\nboulders. They are from 10 to 60 feet broad, and merely differ from the\r\nside of the mountain by being somewhat less steep.\r\n\r\nOn closer inspection, we find that these terraces are stratified in\r\nthe ordinary manner of alluvial or littoral deposits, as may be seen at\r\nthose points where ravines have been excavated by torrents. The parallel\r\nshelves, therefore, have not been caused by denudation, but by the\r\ndeposition of detritus, precisely similar to that which is dispersed in\r\nsmaller quantities over the declivities of the hills above. These hills\r\nconsist of clay-slate, mica schist, and granite, which rocks have been\r\nworn away and laid bare at a few points immediately above the parallel\r\nroads. The lowest of these roads is about 850 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, the next about 212 feet higher, and the third 82 feet above\r\nthe second. There is a fourth shelf, which occurs only in a contiguous\r\nvalley called Glen Gluoy, which is 12 feet above the highest of all the\r\nGlen Roy roads, and consequently about 1156 feet above the level of the\r\nsea.*\r\n\r\n     (* Another detached shelf also occurs at Kilfinnan. (See\r\n     Map, Figure 36.))\r\n\r\nOne only, the lowest of the three roads of Glen Roy, is continued\r\nthroughout Glen Spean, a large valley with which Glen Roy unites. (See\r\nPlate 2 and map, Figure 36.) As the shelves, having no slope towards\r\nthe sea like ordinary river terraces, are always at the same absolute\r\nheight, they become continually more elevated above the river in\r\nproportion as we descend each valley; and they at length terminate very\r\nabruptly, without any obvious cause, or any change either in the shape\r\nof the ground or in the composition or hardness of the rocks.\r\n\r\nI should exceed the limits of this work, were I to attempt to give a\r\nfull description of all the geographical circumstances attending these\r\nsingular terraces, or to discuss the ingenious theories which have been\r\nseverally proposed to account for them by Dr. Macculloch, Sir T. Lauder,\r\nand Messrs. Darwin, Agassiz, Milne, and Chambers. There is one point,\r\nhowever, on which all are agreed, namely, that these shelves are ancient\r\nbeaches, or littoral formations, accumulated round the edges of one or\r\nmore sheets of water which once stood for a long time successively at\r\nthe level of the several shelves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 37. Section Through Side of Loch]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 37. SECTION THROUGH SIDE OF LOCH.\r\n\r\n   AB. Supposed original surface of rock.\r\n   CD. Roads or shelves in the outer alluvial covering of the hill.)\r\n\r\nIt is well known, that wherever a lake or marine fjord exists surrounded\r\nby steep mountains subject to disintegration by frost or the action of\r\ntorrents, some loose matter is washed down annually, especially during\r\nthe melting of snow, and a check is given to the descent of this\r\ndetritus at the point where it reaches the waters of the lake. The waves\r\nthen spread out the materials along the shore, and throw some of them\r\nupon the beach; their dispersing power being aided by the ice, which\r\noften adheres to pebbles during the winter months, and gives buoyancy\r\nto them. The annexed diagram (Figure 37) illustrates the manner in which\r\nDr. MacCulloch and Mr. Darwin suppose \"the roads\" to constitute mere\r\nexcrescences of the superficial alluvial coating which rests upon the\r\nhillside, and consists chiefly of clay and sharp unrounded stones.\r\n\r\nAmong other proofs that the parallel roads have really been formed along\r\nthe margin of a sheet of water, it may be mentioned, that wherever an\r\nisolated hill rises in the middle of the glen above the level of any\r\nparticular shelf, as in Mealderry, Plate 2, a corresponding shelf is\r\nseen at the same level passing round the hill, as would have happened if\r\nit had once formed an island in a lake or fjord. Another very remarkable\r\npeculiarity in these terraces is this; each of them comes in some\r\nportion of its course to a col, or parting ridge, between the heads of\r\nglens, the explanation of which will be considered in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThose writers who first advocated the doctrine that the roads were the\r\nancient beaches of freshwater lakes, were unable to offer any probable\r\nhypothesis respecting the formation and subsequent removal of barriers\r\nof sufficient height and solidity to dam up the water. To introduce\r\nany violent convulsion for their removal was inconsistent with the\r\nuninterrupted horizontality of the roads, and with the undisturbed\r\naspect of those parts of the glens where the shelves come suddenly to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nMr. Agassiz and Dr. Buckland, desirous, like the defenders of the lake\r\ntheory, to account for the limitation of the shelves to certain glens,\r\nand their absence in contiguous glens, where the rocks are of the same\r\ncomposition, and the slope and inclination of the ground very similar,\r\nfirst started the theory that these valleys were once blocked up by\r\nenormous glaciers descending from Ben Nevis, giving rise to what are\r\ncalled, in Switzerland and in the Tyrol, glacier-lakes. In corroboration\r\nof this view, they contended that the alluvium of Glen Roy, as well as\r\nof other parts of Scotland, agrees in character with the moraines of\r\nglaciers seen in the Alpine valleys of Switzerland. It will readily be\r\nconceded that this hypothesis was preferable to any previous lacustrine\r\ntheory, by accounting more easily for the temporary existence and entire\r\ndisappearance of lofty transverse barriers, although the height required\r\nfor the supposed dams of ice appeared very enormous.\r\n\r\nBefore the idea of glacier-lakes had been suggested by Agassiz, Mr.\r\nDarwin examined Glen Roy, and came to the opinion that the shelves were\r\nformed when the glens were still arms of the sea, and, consequently,\r\nthat there never were any seaward barriers. According to him, the\r\nland emerged during a slow and uniform upward movement, like that now\r\nexperienced throughout a large part of Sweden and Finland; but there\r\nwere certain pauses in the upheaving process, at which times the waters\r\nof the sea remained stationary for so many centuries as to allow of the\r\naccumulation of an extraordinary quantity of detrital matter, and the\r\nexcavation, at many points immediately above the sea-level, of deep\r\nnotches and bare cliffs in the hard and solid rock.\r\n\r\nThis theory I adopted in 1841 (\"Elements,\" 2nd edition), as appearing to\r\nme less objectionable than any other then proposed. The phenomena most\r\ndifficult to reconcile with it are, first, the abrupt cessation of the\r\nroads at certain points in the different glens; secondly, their unequal\r\nnumber in different valleys connecting with each other, there being\r\nthree, for example, in Glen Roy, and only one in Glen Spean; thirdly,\r\nthe precise horizontality of level maintained by the same shelf over a\r\nspace many leagues in length, requiring us to assume, that during a\r\nrise of 1156 feet no one portion of the land was raised even a few yards\r\nabove another; fourthly, the coincidence of level already alluded to of\r\neach shelf with a col, or the point forming the head of two glens, from\r\nwhich the rain-waters flow in opposite directions. This last-mentioned\r\nfeature in the physical geography of Lochaber Mr. Darwin endeavoured to\r\nexplain in the following manner. He called these cols \"land-straits,\"\r\nand regarding them as having been anciently sounds or channels between\r\nislands, he pointed out that there is a tendency in such sounds to be\r\nsilted up, and always the more so in proportion to their narrowness. In\r\na chart of the Falkland Islands, by Captain Sulivan, R.N., it appears\r\nthat there are several examples there of straits where the soundings\r\ndiminish regularly towards the narrowest part. One is so nearly dry that\r\nit can be walked over at low water, and another, no longer covered by\r\nthe sea, is supposed to have recently dried up in consequence of a small\r\nalteration in the relative level of sea and land. \"Similar straits,\"\r\nobserves Mr. Chambers, \"hovering, in character, between sea and land,\r\nand which may be called fords, are met with in the Hebrides. Such, for\r\nexample, is the passage dividing the islands of Lewis and Harris, and\r\nthat between North Uist and Benbecula, both of which would undoubtedly\r\nappear as cols, coinciding with a terrace or raised beach, all round the\r\nislands if the sea were to subside.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* R. Chambers, \"Ancient Sea Margins\" page 114.)\r\n\r\nThe first of the difficulties above alluded to, namely, the\r\nnon-extension of the shelves over certain parts of the glens, might\r\nbe explained, said Mr. Darwin, by supposing in certain places a quick\r\ngrowth of green turf on a good soil, which prevented the rain from\r\nwashing away any loose materials lying on the surface. But wherever the\r\nsoil was barren, and where green sward took long to form, there may have\r\nbeen time for the removal of the gravel. In one case an intermediate\r\nshelf appears for a short distance (three quarters of a mile) on the\r\nface of the mountain called Tombhran, between the two upper shelves,\r\nand is seen nowhere else. It occurs where there was the longest space of\r\nopen water, and where the waves may have acquired a more than ordinary\r\npower to heap up detritus.\r\n\r\nThe unequal number of the shelves in valleys communicating with each\r\nother, and in which the boundary rocks are similar in composition, and\r\nthe general absence of any shelves at corresponding altitudes in glens\r\non the opposite watershed, like that of the Spey, and in valleys where\r\nthe waters flow eastward, are difficulties attending the marine theory\r\nwhich have never yet been got over. Mr. T.F. Jamieson, before cited,\r\nhas, during a late visit to Lochaber, in 1861, observed many facts\r\nhighly confirmatory of the hypothesis of glacier-lakes which, as I have\r\nalready stated, was originally advanced by Mr. Agassiz. In the first\r\nplace, he found much superficial scoring and polishing of rocks, and\r\naccumulation of boulders at those points where signs of glacial action\r\nought to appear, if ice had once dammed up the waters of the glens in\r\nwhich the \"roads\" occur. Ben Nevis may have sent down its glaciers from\r\nthe south, and Glen Arkaig from the north, for the mountains at the head\r\nof the last-mentioned glen are 3000 feet high, and may, together with\r\nother tributary glens, have helped to choke up the great Caledonian\r\nvalley with ice, so as to block up for a time the mouths of the\r\nSpean, Roy, and Gluoy. The temporary conversion of these glens into\r\nglacier-lakes is the more conceivable, because the hills at their upper\r\nends not being lofty nor of great extent, they may not have been filled\r\nwith ice at a time when great glaciers were generated in other adjoining\r\nand much higher regions.\r\n\r\nSecondly. The shelves, says Mr. Jamieson, are more precisely defined\r\nand unbroken than any of the raised beaches or acknowledged ancient\r\ncoast-lines visible on the west of Scotland, as in Argyllshire, for\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nThirdly. At the level of the lower shelf in Glen Roy, at points\r\nwhere torrents now cut channels through the shelf as they descend the\r\nhill-side, there are small delta-like extensions of the shelf, perfectly\r\npreserved, as if the materials, whether fine or coarse, had originally\r\nsettled there in a placid lake, and had not been acted upon by tidal\r\ncurrents, mingling them with the sediment of other streams. These deltas\r\nare too entire to allow us to suppose that they have at any time since\r\ntheir origin been exposed to the waves of the sea.\r\n\r\nFourthly. The alluvium on the cols or watersheds, before alluded to, is\r\nsuch as would have been formed if the waters of the rivers had been made\r\nto flow east, or out of the upper ends of the supposed glacier-lakes,\r\ninstead of escaping at the lower ends, in a westerly direction, where\r\nthe great blockages of ice are assumed to have occurred.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these arguments of Mr. Jamieson, I may mention that\r\nin Switzerland, at present, no testacea live in the cold waters of\r\nglacier-lakes; so that the entire absence of fossil shells, whether\r\nmarine or freshwater, in the stratified materials of each shelf, would\r\nbe accounted for if the theory above mentioned be embraced.\r\n\r\nWhen I examined \"the parallel roads\" in 1825, in company with Dr.\r\nBuckland, neither this glacier theory nor Mr. Darwin's suggestion of\r\nancient sea-margins had been proposed, and I have never since revisited\r\nLochaber. But I retain in my memory a vivid recollection of the\r\nscenery and physical features of the district, and I now consider the\r\nglacier-lake theory as affording by far the most satisfactory solution\r\nof this difficult problem. The objection to it, which until lately\r\nappeared to be the most formidable, and which led Mr. Robert Chambers\r\nin his \"Sea Margins,\" to reject it entirely, was the difficulty of\r\nconceiving how the waters could be made to stand so high in Glen Roy as\r\nto allow the uppermost shelf to be formed. Grant a barrier of ice in the\r\nlower part of the glen of sufficient altitude to stop the waters from\r\nflowing westward, still, what prevented them from escaping over the col\r\nat the head of Glen Glaster? This col coincides exactly in level, as Mr.\r\nMilne Home first ascertained, with the second or middle shelf of Glen\r\nRoy. The difficulty here stated appears now to be removed by supposing\r\nthat the higher lines or roads were formed before the lower ones, and\r\nwhen the quantity of ice was most in excess. We must imagine that at the\r\ntime when the uppermost shelf of Glen Roy was forming in a shallow lake,\r\nthe lower part of that glen was filled up with ice, and, according to\r\nMr. Jamieson, a glacier from Loch Treig then protruded itself across\r\nGlen Spean and rested on the flank of the hill on the opposite side in\r\nsuch a manner as effectually to prevent any water from escaping over the\r\nGlen Glaster col. The proofs of such a glacier having actually existed\r\nat the point in question consist, he says, in numerous cross striae\r\nobservable in the bottom of Glen Spean, and in the presence of moraine\r\nmatter in considerable abundance on the flanks of the hill extending\r\nto heights above the Glen Glaster col. When the ice shrank into less\r\ndimensions the second shelf would be formed, having its level determined\r\nby the col last mentioned, Glen Spean in the meantime being filled with\r\na glacier. Finally, the ice blockage common to glens Roy, Spean, and\r\nLaggan, which consisted probably of a glacier from Ben Nevis, gave rise\r\nto the lowest and most extensive lake, the waters of which escaped over\r\nthe pass of Muckul or the col at the head of Loch Laggan, which, as Mr.\r\nJamieson has now ascertained: agrees precisely in level with the lowest\r\nof all the shelves, and where there are unequivocal signs of a river\r\nhaving flowed out for a considerable period.\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker has described some parallel terraces, very analogous in their\r\naspect to those of Glen Roy, as existing in the higher valleys of\r\nthe Himalaya, of which his pencil has given us several graphic\r\nillustrations. He believes these Indian shelves to have originated on\r\nthe borders of glacier-lakes, the barriers of which were usually\r\nformed by the ice and moraines of lateral or tributary glaciers, which\r\ndescended into and crossed the main valley, as we have supposed in the\r\ncase of Glen Roy; but others he ascribes to the terminal moraine of the\r\nprincipal glacier itself, which had retreated during a series of milder\r\nseasons, so as to leave an interval between the ice and the terminal\r\nmoraine. This interspace caused by the melting of ice becomes filled\r\nwith water and forms a lake, the drainage of which usually takes place\r\nby percolation through the porous parts of the moraine, and not by a\r\nstream overflowing that barrier. Such a glacier-lake Dr. Hooker actually\r\nfound in existence near the head of the Yangma valley in the Himalaya.\r\nIt was moreover partially bounded by recently formed marginal terraces\r\nor parallel roads, implying changes of level in the barrier of ice and\r\nmoraine matter.*\r\n\r\n     (* Hooker, \"Himalayan Journal\" volume 1 page 242; 2 pages\r\n     119, 121, 166. I have also profited by the author's personal\r\n     explanations.)\r\n\r\nIt has been sometimes objected to the hypothesis of glacier-lakes, as\r\napplied to the case of Glen Roy, that the shelves must have taken a very\r\nlong period for their formation. Such a lapse of time, it is said, might\r\nbe consistent with the theory of pauses or stationary periods in the\r\nrise of the land during an intermittent upward movement, but it is\r\nhardly compatible with the idea of so precarious and fluctuating\r\na barrier as a mass of ice. But the reader will have seen that the\r\npermanency of level in such glacier-lakes has no necessary connection\r\nwith minor changes in the height of the supposed dam of ice. If a\r\nglacier descending from higher mountains through a tributary glen enters\r\nthe main valley in which there happens to be no glacier, the river is\r\narrested in its course and a lake is formed. The dam may be constantly\r\nrepaired and may vary in height several hundreds of feet without\r\naffecting the level of the lake, so long as the surplus waters escape\r\nover a col or parting ridge of rock. The height at which the waters\r\nremain stationary is determined solely by the elevation of the col, and\r\nnot by the barrier of ice, provided the barrier is higher than the col.\r\n\r\nBut if we embrace the theory of glacier-lakes, we must be prepared\r\nto assume not only that the sea had nothing to do with the original\r\nformation of the \"parallel roads,\" but that it has never, since the\r\ndisappearance of the lakes, risen in any one of the glens up to the\r\nlevel of the lowest shelf, which is about 850 feet high; for in that\r\ncase the remarkable persistency and integrity of the roads and deltas,\r\nbefore described, must have been impaired.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that 50 miles to the south of Lochaber, the glacier\r\nformations of Lanarkshire with marine shells of arctic character have\r\nbeen traced to the height of 524 feet. About 50 miles to the south-east\r\nin Perthshire are those stratified clays and sands, near Killiecrankie,\r\nwhich were once supposed to be of submarine origin, and which in that\r\ncase would imply the former submergence of what is now dry land to the\r\nextent of 1550 feet, or several hundred feet beyond the highest of the\r\nparallel roads. Even granting that these laminated drifts may have had\r\na different origin, as above suggested, there are still many facts\r\nconnected with the distribution of erratics and the striation of rocks\r\nin Scotland which are not easily accounted for without supposing the\r\ncountry to have sunk, since the era of continental ice, to a greater\r\ndepth than 525 feet, the highest point to which marine shells have yet\r\nbeen traced.\r\n\r\nAfter what was said of the pressure and abrading power of a general\r\ncrust of ice, like that now covering Greenland, it is almost superfluous\r\nto say that the parallel roads must have been of later date than such a\r\nstate of things, for every trace of them must have been obliterated\r\nby the movement of such a mass of ice. It is no less clear that as no\r\nglacier-lakes can now exist in Greenland [26], so there could have been\r\nnone in Scotland, when the mountains were covered with one great crust\r\nof ice. It may, however, be contended that the parallel roads were\r\nproduced when the general crust of ice first gave place to a period\r\nof separate glaciers, and that no period of deep submergence ever\r\nintervened in Lochaber after the time of the lakes. Even in that case,\r\nhowever, it is difficult not to suppose that the Glen Roy country\r\nparticipated in the downward movement which sank part of Lanarkshire\r\n525 feet beneath the sea, subsequently to the first great glaciation of\r\nScotland. Yet that amount of subsidence might have occurred, and even a\r\nmore considerable one, without causing the sea to rise to the level\r\nof the lowest shelf, or to a height of 850 feet above the present\r\nsea-level.\r\n\r\nThis is a question on which I am not prepared at present to offer a\r\ndecided opinion.\r\n\r\nWhether the horizontality of the shelves or terrace-lines is really as\r\nperfect as has been generally assumed is a point which will require to\r\nbe tested by a more accurate trigonometrical survey than has yet been\r\nmade. The preservation of precisely the same level in the lowest line\r\nthroughout the glens of Roy, Spean, and Laggan, for a distance of 20\r\nmiles east and west, and 10 or 12 miles north and south, would be very\r\nwonderful if ascertained with mathematical precision. Mr. Jamieson,\r\nafter making in 1862 several measurements with a spirit-level, has been\r\nled to suspect a rise in the lowest shelf of one foot in a mile in a\r\ndirection from west to east, or from the mouth of Glen Roy to a point\r\n6 miles east of it in Glen Spean. To confirm such observations, and to\r\ndetermine whether a similar rate of rise continues eastward, as far as\r\nthe pass of Muckul, would be most important.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I conclude that the Glen Roy terrace-lines and those of\r\nsome neighbouring valleys, were formed on the borders of glacier-lakes,\r\nin times long subsequent to the principal glaciation of Scotland. They\r\nmay perhaps have been nearly as late, especially the lowest of the\r\nshelves, as that portion of the Pleistocene period in which Man\r\nco-existed in Europe with the mammoth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. -- CHRONOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD AND THE\r\nEARLIEST SIGNS OF MAN'S APPEARANCE IN EUROPE--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n   Signs of extinct Glaciers in Wales.\r\n   Great Submergence of Wales during the Glacial Period proved by\r\n      Marine Shells.\r\n   Still greater Depression inferred from Stratified Drift.\r\n   Scarcity of Organic Remains in Glacial Formations.\r\n   Signs of extinct Glaciers in England.\r\n   Ice Action in Ireland.\r\n   Maps illustrating successive Revolutions in Physical Geography\r\n      during the Pleistocene Period.\r\n   Southernmost Extent of Erratics in England.\r\n   Successive Periods of Junction and Separation of England, Ireland,\r\n      and the Continent.\r\n   Time required for these Changes.\r\n   Probable Causes of the Upheaval and Subsidence of the Earth's Crust.\r\n   Antiquity of Man considered in relation to the Age of the existing\r\n      Fauna and Flora.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTINCT GLACIERS IN WALES.\r\n\r\nThe considerable amount of vertical movement in opposite directions,\r\nwhich was suggested in the last chapter, as affording the most probable\r\nexplanation of the position of some of the stratified and fossiliferous\r\ndrifts of Scotland, formed since the commencement of the glacial\r\nperiod, will appear less startling if it can be shown that independent\r\nobservations lead us to infer that a geographical revolution of still\r\ngreater magnitude accompanied the successive phases of glaciation\r\nthrough which the Welsh mountains have passed.\r\n\r\nThat Wales was once an independent centre of the dispersion of erratic\r\nblocks has long been acknowledged. Dr. Buckland published in 1842 his\r\nreasons for believing that the Snowdonian mountains in Caernarvonshire\r\nwere formerly covered with glaciers, which radiated from the central\r\nheights through the seven principal valleys of that chain, where striae\r\nand flutings are seen on the polished rocks directed towards as many\r\ndifferent points of the compass. He also described the \"moraines\" of\r\nthe ancient glaciers, and the rounded masses of polished rock, called\r\nin Switzerland \"roches moutonnees.\" His views respecting the old extinct\r\nglaciers of North Wales were subsequently confirmed by Mr. Darwin,\r\nwho attributed the transport of many of the larger erratic blocks to\r\nfloating ice. Much of the Welsh glacial drift had already been shown by\r\nMr. Trimmer to have had a submarine origin, and Mr. Darwin maintained\r\nthat when the land rose again to nearly its present height, glaciers\r\nfilled the valleys, and \"swept them clean of all the rubbish left by the\r\nsea.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Philosophical Magazine\" series 3 volume 21 page 180.)\r\n\r\nProfessor Ramsay, in a paper read to the Geological Society in 1851,\r\nand in a later work on the glaciation of North Wales, described three\r\nsuccessive glacial periods, during the first of which the land was much\r\nhigher than it now is, and the quantity of ice excessive; secondly, a\r\nperiod of submergence when the land was 2300 feet lower than at present,\r\nand when the higher mountain tops only stood out of the sea as a cluster\r\nof low islands, which nevertheless were covered with snow; and lastly,\r\na third period when the marine boulder drift formed in the middle period\r\nwas ploughed out of the larger valleys by a second set of glaciers,\r\nsmaller than those of the first period. This last stage of glaciation\r\nmay have coincided with that of the parallel roads of Glen Roy,\r\nspoken of in the last chapter. In Wales it was certainly preceded by\r\nsubmergence, and the rocks had been exposed to glacial polishing and\r\nfriction before they sank.\r\n\r\nFortunately the evidence of the sojourn of the Welsh mountains beneath\r\nthe waters of the sea is not deficient, as in Scotland, in that complete\r\ndemonstration which the presence of marine shells affords. The late Mr.\r\nTrimmer discovered such shells on Moel Tryfan, in North Wales, in drift\r\nelevated more than 1300 feet above the level of the sea. It appears from\r\nhis observations, and those of the late Edward Forbes, corroborated by\r\nothers of Professor Ramsay and Mr. Prestwich, that about twelve species\r\nof shells, including Fusus bamfius, F. antiquus, Venus striatula (Forbes\r\nand Hanley), have been met with at heights of between 1000 and 1400\r\nfeet, in drift, reposing on a surface of rock which had been previously\r\nexposed to glacial friction and striation.*\r\n\r\n     (* Ramsay, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\"\r\n     volume 8 1852 page 372.)\r\n\r\nThe shells, as a whole, are those of the glacial period, and not of the\r\nNorwich Crag. Two localities of these shells in Wales, in addition\r\nto that first pointed out by Mr. Trimmer, have since been observed\r\nby Professor Ramsay, who, however, is of opinion that the amount of\r\nsubmergence can by no means be limited to the extreme height to which\r\nthe shells happen to have been traced; for drift of the same character\r\nas that of Moel Tryfan extends continuously to the height of 2300 feet.\r\n[27]\r\n\r\n\r\nRARITY OF ORGANIC REMAINS IN GLACIAL FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe general dearth of shells in such formations, below as well as\r\nabove the level at which Mr. Trimmer first found them, deserves notice.\r\nWhether we can explain it or not, it is a negative character which seems\r\nto belong very generally to deposits formed in glacial seas. The porous\r\nnature of the strata, and the length of time during which they have been\r\npermeated by rain-water, may partly account, as we hinted in a former\r\nchapter, for the destruction of organic remains. But it is also possible\r\nthat they were originally scarce, for we read of the waters of the\r\nsea being so freshened and chilled by the melting of ice-bergs in some\r\nNorwegian and Icelandic fjords, that the fish are driven away, and all\r\nthe mollusca killed. The moraines of glaciers are always from the first\r\ndevoid of shells, and if transported by ice-bergs to a distance,\r\nand deposited where the ice melts, may continue as barren of every\r\nindication of life as they were when they originated.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it may be said, on the other hand, that herds of seals and\r\nwalruses crowd the floating ice of Spitzbergen in latitude 80 degrees\r\nnorth, of which Mr. Lamont has recently given us a lively picture,*nand\r\nhuge whales fatten on myriads of pteropods in polar regions.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Seasons with the Sea-Horses\" 1861.)\r\n\r\nIt had been suggested that the bottom of the sea, at the era of extreme\r\nsubmergence in Scotland and Wales, was so deep as to reach the zero\r\nof animal life, which, in part of the Mediterranean (the Aegean,\r\nfor example), the late Edward Forbes fixed, after a long series of\r\ndredgings, at 300 fathoms. But the shells of the glacial drift of\r\nScotland and Wales, when they do occur, are not always those of deep\r\nseas; and, moreover, our faith in the uninhabitable state of the ocean\r\nat great depths has been rudely shaken, by the recent discovery of\r\nCaptain McClintock and Dr. Wallich, of starfish in water more than\r\na thousand fathoms deep (7560 feet!), midway between Greenland and\r\nIceland. That these radiata were really dredged up from the bottom, and\r\nthat they had been living and feeding there, appeared from the fact\r\nthat their stomachs were full of Globigerina, of which foraminiferous\r\ncreatures, both living and dead, the oozy bed of the ocean at that vast\r\ndepth was found to be exclusively composed. [28]\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the cause, the fact is certain, that over large areas\r\nin Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, I might add throughout the northern\r\nhemisphere on both sides of the Atlantic, the stratified drift of the\r\nglacial period is very commonly devoid of fossils, in spite of the\r\noccurrence here and there, at the height of 500, 700, and even\r\n1400 feet, of marine shells. These, when met with, belong, with few\r\nexceptions, to known living species. I am therefore unable to agree with\r\nMr. Kjerulf that the amount of former submergence can be measured by the\r\nextreme height at which shells happen to have been found.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIAL FORMATIONS IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 38. Dome-shaped Rocks]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 38. DOME-SHAPED ROCKS, OR \"ROCHES MOUTONEES,\" IN THE VALLEY\r\n  OF THE ROTHAY, NEAR AMBLESIDE, FROM A DRAWING BY E. HULL, F.G.S.*\r\n   (* \"Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal\" volume 11 Plate 1 page 31\r\n     1860.))\r\n\r\nThe mountains of Cumberland and Westmorland, and the English lake\r\ndistrict, afford equally unequivocal vestiges of ice-action not only\r\nin the form of polished and grooved surfaces, but also of those rounded\r\nbosses before mentioned as being so abundant in the Alpine valleys of\r\nSwitzerland, where glaciers exist, or have existed. Mr. Hall has\r\nlately published a faithful account of these phenomena, and has given\r\na representation of some of the English \"roches moutonnees,\" which\r\nprecisely resemble hundreds of dome-shaped protuberances in North Wales,\r\nSweden, and North America.*\r\n\r\n     (* Hull, \"Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal\" July 1860.)\r\n\r\nThe marks of glaciation on the rocks, and the transportation of erratics\r\nfrom Cumberland to the eastward, have been traced by Professor Phillips\r\nover a large part of Yorkshire, extending to a height of 1500 feet above\r\nthe sea; and similar northern drift has been observed in Lancashire,\r\nCheshire, Derbyshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, and Worcestershire. It\r\nis rare to find marine shells, except at heights of 200 or 300 feet;\r\nbut a few instances of their occurrence have been noticed, especially\r\nof Turritella communis (a gregarious shell), far in the interior, at\r\nelevations of 500 feet, and even of 700 in Derbyshire, and some adjacent\r\ncounties, as I learn from Mr. Binney and Mr. Prestwich.\r\n\r\nSuch instances are of no small theoretical interest, as enabling us\r\nto account for the scattering of large erratic blocks at equal or\r\nmuch greater elevations, over a large part of the northern and midland\r\ncounties, such as could only have been conveyed to their present sites\r\nby floating ice. Of this nature, among others, is a remarkable angular\r\nblock of syenitic greenstone, 4 1/2 feet by 4 feet square, and 2 feet\r\nthick, which Mr. Darwin describes as lying on the summit of Ashley\r\nHeath, in Staffordshire, 803 feet above the sea, resting on New Red\r\nSandstone.*\r\n\r\n     (* Ancient Glaciers of Caernarvonshire, \"Philosophical\r\n     Magazine\" series 3, 21 page 180.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF ICE-ACTION AND SUBMERGENCE IN IRELAND DURING THE GLACIAL\r\nPERIOD.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland we encounter the same difficulty as in Scotland in\r\ndetermining how much of the glaciation of the higher mountains should\r\nbe referred to land glaciers, and how much to floating ice, during\r\nsubmergence. The signs of glacial action have been traced by Professor\r\nJukes to elevations of 2500 feet in the Killarney district, and to great\r\nheights in other mountainous regions; but marine shells have rarely been\r\nmet with higher than 600 feet above the sea, and that chiefly in gravel,\r\nclay, and sand in Wicklow and Wexford. They are so rare in the drift\r\neast of the Wicklow mountains, that an exception to the rule, lately\r\nobserved at Ballymore Eustace, by Professor Jukes, is considered as a\r\nfact of no small geological interest. The wide extent of drift of the\r\nsame character, spread over large areas in Ireland, shows that the\r\nwhole island was, in some part of the glacial period, an archipelago, as\r\nrepresented in the maps, Figures 39 and 40.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Wexford drift, the late Professor E. Forbes states\r\nthat Sir H. James found in it, together with many of the usual glacial\r\nshells, several species which are characteristic of the Crag; among\r\nothers the reversed variety of Fusus antiquus, called F. contrarius,\r\nand the extinct species Nucula Cobboldiae, and Turritella incrassata.\r\nPerhaps a portion of this drift of the south of Ireland may belong to\r\nthe close of the Pliocene period, and may be of a somewhat older date\r\nthan the shells of the Clyde, alluded to in Chapter 13. They may also\r\ncorrespond still more nearly in age with the fauna of the uppermost\r\nstrata of the Norwich Crag, occurring at Chillesford. [29]\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of mammalian remains in the Irish drift favours the theory\r\nof its marine origin. In the superficial deposits of the whole island,\r\nI have only met with three recorded examples of the mammoth, one in\r\nthe south near Dungarvan, where the bones of Elephas primigenius, two\r\nspecies of bear (Ursus arctos and Ursus spelaeus?), the reindeer, horse,\r\netc., were found in a cave;* another in the centre of the island near\r\nBelturbet, in the county of Cavan.\r\n\r\n     (* E. Brenan and Dr. Carte, Dublin 1859.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps the conversion into land of the bed of the glacial sea, and the\r\nimmigration into the newly upheaved region of the elephant, rhinoceros,\r\nand hippopotamus, which co-existed with the fabricators of the St.\r\nAcheul flint hatchets, were events which preceded in time the elevation\r\nof the Irish drift, and the union of that island with England. Ireland\r\nmay have continued for a longer time in the state of an archipelago,\r\nand was therefore for a much shorter time inhabited by the large extinct\r\nPleistocene pachyderms.\r\n\r\nIn one of the reports of the Geological Survey of Ireland, published in\r\n1859, Professor Jukes, in explanation of sheet 184 of the maps, alludes\r\nto beds of sand and gravel, and signs of the polishing and furrowing of\r\nthe rocks in the counties of Kerry and Killarney, as high as 2500 feet\r\nabove the sea, and supposes (perhaps with good reason) that the land\r\nwas depressed even to that extent. He observes that above that elevation\r\n(2500 feet) the rocks are rough, and not smoothed, as if by ice. Some\r\nof the drift was traced as high as 1500 feet, the highest hills there\r\nexceeding 3400 feet. Mr. Jukes, however, is by no means inclined to\r\ninsist on submergence to the extent of 2500 feet, as he is aware that\r\nice, like that now prevailing in Greenland, might explain most, if not\r\nall, the appearances of glaciation in the highest regions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the course taken by the Irish erratics in general is such\r\nthat their transportation seems to have been due to floating ice or\r\ncoast-ice, yet some granite blocks have travelled from south to north,\r\nas recorded by Sir R. Griffiths, namely, those of the Ox Mountains in\r\nSligo; a fact from which Mr. Jamieson infers that those mountains formed\r\nat one time a centre of dispersion. In the same part of Ireland, the\r\ngeneral direction in which the boulders have travelled is everywhere\r\nfrom north-west to south-east, a course directly at right angles to the\r\nprevailing trend of the present mountain ridges.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPS ILLUSTRATING SUCCESSIVE REVOLUTIONS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY DURING\r\nTHE PLEISTOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 39.

The more limited westerly extension of the West Coast\r\n        of Ireland.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Trimmer, before referred to, has endeavoured to assist our\r\nspeculations as to the successive revolutions in physical geography,\r\nthrough which the British Islands have passed since the commencement\r\nof the glacial period, by four \"sketch maps\" as he termed them, in the\r\nfirst of which he gave an ideal restoration of the original Continental\r\nperiod, called by him the first elephantine period, or that of the\r\nforest of Cromer, before described. He was not aware that the prevailing\r\nelephant of that era (E. meridionalis) was distinct from the mammoth. At\r\nthis era he conceived Ireland and England to have been united with each\r\nother and with France, but much of the area represented as land in the\r\nmap, Figure 41, was supposed to be under water. His second map, of the\r\ngreat submergence of the glacial period, was not essentially different\r\nfrom our map, Figure 39. His third map expressed a period of partial\r\nre-elevation, when Ireland was reunited to Scotland and the north of\r\nEngland; but England still separated from France. This restoration\r\nappears to me to rest on insufficient data, being constructed to suit\r\nthe supposed area over which the gigantic Irish deer, or Megaceros,\r\nmigrated from east to west, also to explain an assumed submergence of\r\nthe district called the Weald, in the south-east of England, which had\r\nremained land during the grand glacial submergence.\r\n\r\nThe fourth map is a return to nearly the same continental conditions\r\nas the first--Ireland, England, and the Continent being united. This he\r\ncalled the second elephantine period; and it would coincide very closely\r\nwith that part of the Pleistocene era in which Man co-existed with the\r\nmammoth, and when, according to Mr. Trimmer's hypothesis previously\r\nindicated by Mr. Godwin-Austen, the Thames was a tributary of the\r\nRhine.*\r\n\r\n     (* Joshua Trimmer, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological\r\n     Society\" volume 9 1853, Plate 13, and Godwin-Austen, ibid.\r\n     volume 7 1851 page 134 and Plate 7.)\r\n\r\nThese geographical speculations were indulged in ten years after Edward\r\nForbes had published his bold generalisations on the geological changes\r\nwhich accompanied the successive establishment of the Scandinavian,\r\nGermanic, and other living floras and faunas in the British Islands,\r\nand, like the theories of his predecessor, were the results of much\r\nreflection on a vast body of geological facts. It is by repeated efforts\r\nof this kind, made by geologists who are prepared for the partial\r\nfailure of some of their first attempts, that we shall ultimately arrive\r\nat a knowledge of the long series of geographical revolutions which have\r\nfollowed each other since the beginning of the Pleistocene period.\r\n\r\nThe map, Figure 39, will give some idea of the great extent of land\r\nwhich would be submerged, were we to infer, as many geologists have\r\ndone, from the joint evidence of marine shells, erratics, glacial striae\r\nand stratified drift at great heights, that Scotland was, during part of\r\nthe glacial period, 2000 feet below its present level, and other parts\r\nof the British Isles, 1300 feet. A subsidence to this amount can be\r\ndemonstrated in the case of North Wales by marine shells. In the lake\r\ndistrict of Cumberland, in Yorkshire, and in Ireland, we must depend on\r\nproofs derived from glacial striae and the transportation of erratics\r\nfor so much of the supposed submergence as exceeds 600 feet. As to\r\ncentral England, or the country north of the Thames and Bristol Channel,\r\nmarine shells of the glacial period sometimes reach as high as 600 and\r\n700 feet, and erratics still higher, as we have seen above. But this\r\nregion is of such moderate elevation above the sea, that it would be\r\nalmost equally laid under water, were there a sinking of no more than\r\n600 feet.\r\n\r\nTo make this last proposition clear, I have constructed, from numerous\r\ndocuments, many of them unpublished, the map, Figure 40, which shows how\r\nthat small amount of subsidence would reduce the whole of the British\r\nIsles to an archipelago of very small islands, with the exception\r\nof parts of Scotland, and the north of England and Wales, where four\r\nislands of considerable dimensions would still remain.\r\n\r\nThe map does not indicate a state of things supposed to have prevailed\r\nat any one moment of the past, because the district south of the Thames\r\nand the Bristol Channel seems to have remained land during the whole of\r\nthe glacial period, at a time when the northern area was under water.\r\nThe map simply represents the effects of a downward movement of a\r\nhundred fathoms, or 600 English feet, assumed to be uniform over the\r\nwhole of the British Isles. It shows the very different state of the\r\nphysical geography of the area in question, when contrasted with the\r\nresults of an opposite movement, or one of upheaval, to an equal amount,\r\nof which Sir Henry de la Beche had already given us a picture, in his\r\nexcellent treatise called \"Theoretical Researches.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Also repeated in De la Beche's \"Geological Observer.\")\r\n\r\nHis map I have borrowed (Figure 41), after making some important\r\ncorrections in it.\r\n\r\nIf we are surprised when looking at the first map, Figure 40, at the\r\nvast expanse of sea which so moderate a subsidence as 600 feet would\r\ncause, we shall probably be still more astonished to perceive, in Figure\r\n41, that a rise of the same number of feet would unite all the British\r\nIsles, including the Hebrides, Orkneys, and Shetlands, with one another\r\nand the Continent, and lay dry the sea now separating Great Britain from\r\nSweden and Denmark.\r\n\r\nIt appears from soundings made during various Admiralty surveys, that\r\nthe gained land thus brought above the level of the sea, instead of\r\npresenting a system of hills and valleys corresponding with those\r\nusually characterising the interior of most of our island, would form\r\na nearly level terrace, or gently inclined plane, sloping outwards\r\nlike those terraces of denudation and deposition which I have elsewhere\r\ndescribed as occurring on the coasts of Sicily and the Morea.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Manual of Geology\" page 74.)\r\n\r\nIt seems that, during former and perhaps repeated oscillations of level\r\nundergone by the British Isles, the sea has had time to cut back the\r\ncliffs for miles in many places, while in others the detritus derived\r\nfrom wasting cliffs drifted along the shores, together with the sediment\r\nbrought down by rivers and swept by currents into submarine valleys,\r\nhas exerted a levelling power, filling up such depressions as may have\r\npre-existed. Owing to this twofold action few marked inequalities of\r\nlevel have been left on the sea-bottom, the \"silver-pits\" off the mouth\r\nof the Humber offering a rare exception to the general rule, and even\r\nthere the narrow depression is less than 300 feet in depth.\r\n\r\nBeyond the 100 fathom line, the submarine slope surrounding the British\r\ncoast is so much steeper that a second elevation of equal amount (or of\r\n600 feet) would add but slightly to the area of gained land; in other\r\nwords, the 100 and 200 fathom lines run very near each other.*\r\n\r\n     (* De la Beche, \"Geological Researches\" page 191.)\r\n\r\nThe naturalist would have been entitled to assume the former union,\r\nwithin the Pleistocene period, of all the British Isles with each other\r\nand with the Continent, as expressed in the map, Figure 41, even if\r\nthere had been no geological facts in favour of such a junction. For in\r\nno other way would he be able to account for the identity of the fauna\r\nand flora found throughout these lands. Had they been separated ever\r\nsince the Miocene period, like Madeira, Porto Santo, and the Desertas,\r\nconstituting the small Madeiran Archipelago, we might have expected\r\nto discover a difference in the species of land-shells, not only when\r\nIreland was compared to England, but when different islands of the\r\nHebrides were contrasted one with another, and each of them with\r\nEngland. It would not, however, be necessary, in order to effect the\r\ncomplete fusion of the animals and plants which we witness, to assume\r\nthat all parts of the area formed continuous land at one and the same\r\nmoment of time, but merely that the several portions were so joined\r\nwithin the Pleistocene era as to allow the animals and plants to migrate\r\nfreely in succession from one district to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERNMOST EXTENT OF ERRATICS IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nIn reference to that portion of the south of England which is marked by\r\ndiagonal lines in Figure 39, the theory of its having been an area of\r\ndry land during the period of great submergence and floating ice does\r\nnot depend merely on negative evidence, such as the absence of the\r\nnorthern drift or boulder clay on its surface; but we have also, in\r\nfavour of the same conclusion, the remarkable fact of the presence of\r\nerratic blocks on the southern coast of Sussex, implying the existence\r\nthere of an ancient coast-line at a period when the cold must have been\r\nat its height.\r\n\r\nThese blocks are to be seen in greatest number at Pagham and Selsea, 15\r\nmiles south of Chichester, in latitude 50 degrees 40 minutes north.\r\n\r\nThey consist of fragments of granite, syenite and greenstone, as well as\r\nof Devonian and Silurian rocks, some of them of large size. I measured\r\none of granite at Pagham, 27 feet in circumference. They are not of\r\nnorthern origin, but must have come from the coast of Normandy or\r\nBrittany, or from land which may once have existed to the south-west, in\r\nwhat is now the English Channel.\r\n\r\nThey were probably drifted into their present site by coast ice, and\r\nthe yellow clay and gravel in which they are embedded are a littoral\r\nformation, as shown by the shells. Beneath the gravel containing these\r\nlarge erratics, is a blue mud in which skeletons of Elephas antiquus,\r\nand other mammalia, have been observed. Still lower occurs a sandy loam,\r\nfrom which Mr. R.G. Austen* has collected thirty-eight species of marine\r\nshells, all Recent, but forming an assemblage differing as a whole from\r\nthat now inhabiting the English Channel.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 13\r\n     1857 page 50.)\r\n\r\nThe presence among them of Lutraria rugosa and Pecten polymorphus,\r\nnot known to range farther north in the actual seas than the coast of\r\nPortugal, indicates a somewhat warmer temperature at the time when\r\nthey flourished. Subsequently, there must have been great cold when the\r\nSelsea erratics were drifted into their present position, and this cold\r\ndoubtless coincided in time with a low temperature farther north. [30]\r\nThese transported rocks of Sussex are somewhat older than a sea-beach\r\nwith Recent marine shells which at Brighton is covered by Chalk rubble,\r\ncalled the \"elephant-bed\" which I cannot describe in this place, but I\r\nallude to it as one of many geological proofs of the former existence\r\nof a seashore in this region, and of ancient cliffs bounding the channel\r\nbetween France and England, all of older date than the close of the\r\nglacial period. [31]\r\n\r\nIn order to form a connected view of the most simple series of changes\r\nin physical geography which can possibly account for the phenomena of\r\nthe glacial period, and the period of the establishment of the present\r\nprovinces of animals and plants, the following geographical states of\r\nthe British and adjoining areas may be enumerated.\r\n\r\nFirst, a continental period, towards the close of which the forest of\r\nCromer flourished: when the land was at least 500 feet above its present\r\nlevel, perhaps much higher, and its extent probably greater than that\r\ngiven in the map, Figure 41.\r\n\r\nSecondly, a period of submergence, by which the land north of the Thames\r\nand Bristol Channel, and that of Ireland, was gradually reduced to such\r\nan archipelago as is pictured in map, Figure 40; and finally to such\r\na general prevalence of sea as is seen in map, Figure 39. This was the\r\nperiod of great submergence and of floating ice, when the Scandinavian\r\nflora, which occupied the lower grounds during the first continental\r\nperiod, may have obtained exclusive possession of the only lands not\r\ncovered with perpetual snow.\r\n\r\nThirdly, a second continental period when the bed of the glacial sea,\r\nwith its marine shells and erratic blocks, was laid dry, and when\r\nthe quantity of land equalled that of the first period, and therefore\r\nprobably exceeded that represented in the map, Figure 41. During this\r\nperiod there were glaciers in the higher mountains of Scotland and\r\nWales, and the Welsh glaciers, as we have seen, pushed before them and\r\ncleared out the marine drift with which some valleys had been filled\r\nduring the period of submergence. The parallel roads of Glen Roy are\r\nreferable to some part of the same era.\r\n\r\nAs a reason for presuming that the land which in map, Figure 41, is only\r\nrepresented as 600 feet above its present level, was during part of this\r\nperiod much higher, Professor Ramsay has suggested that, as the previous\r\ndepression far exceeded 100 fathoms (amounting in Wales to 1400 feet,\r\nas shown by marine shells, and to 2300, by stratified drift), it is not\r\nimprobable that the upward movement was on a corresponding scale.\r\n\r\nIn passing from the period of chief submergence to this second\r\ncontinental condition of things, we may conceive a gradual change first\r\nfrom that of Map 39 to Map 40, then from the latter phase to that of Map\r\n41, and finally to still greater accessions of land. During this last\r\nperiod the passage of the Germanic flora into the British area took\r\nplace, and the Scandinavian plants, together with northern insects,\r\nbirds, and quadrupeds, retreated into the higher grounds.\r\n\r\nJudging from the evidence at present before us, the first appearance of\r\nMan, when, together with the mammoth and woolly rhinoceros, or with the\r\nElephas antiquus, Rhinoceros hemitoechus, and Hippopotamus major, he\r\nranged freely from all parts of the Continent into the British area,\r\ntook place during this second continental period.\r\n\r\nFourthly, the next and last change comprised the breaking up of the\r\nland of the British area once more into numerous islands, ending in\r\nthe present geographical condition of things. There were probably many\r\noscillations of level during this last conversion of continuous land\r\ninto islands, and such movements in opposite directions would account\r\nfor the occurrence of marine shells at moderate heights above the level\r\nof the sea, notwithstanding a general lowering of the land. To the close\r\nof this era belong the marine deposits of the Clyde and the Carses of\r\nthe Tay and Forth, before alluded to.\r\n\r\nIn a memoir by Professor E. Forbes, before cited, he observes, that the\r\nland of passage by which the plants and animals migrated into Ireland\r\nconsisted of the upraised marine drift which had previously formed the\r\nbottom of the glacial sea. Portions of this drift extend to the eastern\r\nshores of Wicklow and Wexford, others are found in the Isle of Man full\r\nof arctic shells, others on the British coast opposite Ireland. The\r\nfreshwater marl, containing numerous skeletons of the great deer,\r\nor Megaceros, overlie in the Isle of Man that marine glacial drift.\r\nProfessor Forbes also remarks that the subsequent disjunction of Ireland\r\nfrom England, or the formation of the Irish Channel, which is less than\r\n400 feet in its greatest depth, preceded the opening of the Straits of\r\nDover, or the final separation of England from the Continent. This he\r\ninferred from the present distribution of species both in the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms. Thus, for example, there are twice as many reptiles\r\nin Belgium as in England, and the number inhabiting England is twice\r\nthat found in Ireland. Yet the Irish species are all common to England,\r\nand all the English to Belgium. It is therefore assumed that the\r\nmigration of species westward having been the work of time, there was\r\nnot sufficient lapse of ages to complete the fusion of the continental\r\nand British reptilian fauna, before France was separated from England\r\nand England from Ireland.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason there are also a great number of birds of short\r\nflight, and small quadrupeds, inhabiting England which do not cross\r\nto Ireland, the Irish Channel seeming to have arrested them in their\r\nwestward course.*\r\n\r\n     (* E. Forbes, Fauna and Flora of British Isles, \"Memoir of\r\n     the Geological Survey\" volume 1 1846 page 344.)\r\n\r\nThe depth of the Irish Channel in the narrower parts is only 360 feet,\r\nand the English Channel between Dover and Calais less than 200, and\r\nrarely anywhere more than 300 feet; so that vertical movements of slight\r\namount compared to some of those previously considered, with the aid of\r\ndenuding operations or the waste of sea cliffs, and the scouring out\r\nof the channel, might in time effect the insulation of the lands above\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSIVE CHANGES IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY IN THE\r\nPLEISTOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe time which it would require to bring about such changes of level,\r\naccording to the average rate assumed in Chapter 3, however vast, will\r\nnot be found to exceed that which would best explain the successive\r\nfluctuations in terrestrial temperature, the glaciation of solid rocks,\r\nthe transportation of erratics above and below the sea-level, the height\r\nof arctic shells above the sea, and last, not least, the migration of\r\nthe existing species of animals and plants into their actual stations,\r\nand the extinction of some conspicuous forms which flourished during\r\nthe Pleistocene ages. When we duly consider all these changes which\r\nhave taken place since the beginning of the glacial epoch, or since the\r\nforest of Cromer and the Elephas meridionalis flourished, we shall find\r\nthat the phenomena become more and more intelligible in proportion to\r\nthe slowness of the rate of elevation and depression which we assume.\r\n\r\nThe submergence of Wales to the extent of 1400 feet, as proved by\r\nglacial shells, would require 56,000 years, at the rate of 2 1/2 feet\r\nper century; but taking Professor Ramsay's estimate of 800 feet more,\r\nthat depression being implied by the position of some of the stratified\r\ndrift, we must demand an additional period of 32,000 years, amounting in\r\nall to 88,000; and the same time would be required for the re-elevation\r\nof the tract to its present height. But if the land rose in the second\r\ncontinental period as much as 600 feet above its present level, as in\r\nFigure 41, this 600 feet, first of rising and then of sinking,\r\nwould require 48,000 years more; the whole of the grand oscillation,\r\ncomprising the submergence and re-emergence, having taken about 224,000\r\nyears for its completion; and this, even if there were no pause or\r\nstationary period, when the downward movement ceased, and before it was\r\nconverted into an upward one.\r\n\r\nI am aware that it may be objected that the average rate here proposed\r\nis a purely arbitrary and conjectural one, because, at the North Cape,\r\nit is supposed that there has been a rise of about 5 feet in a century,\r\nand at Spitsbergen, according to Mr. Lamont, a still faster upheaval\r\nduring the last 400 years.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Seasons with the Sea-Horses\" page 202.)\r\n\r\nBut, granting that in these and some exceptional cases (none of them as\r\nyet very well established) the rising or sinking has, for a time, been\r\naccelerated, I do not believe the average rate of motion to exceed that\r\nabove proposed. Mr. Darwin, I find, considers that such a mean rate of\r\nupheaval would be as high as we could assume for the west coast of South\r\nAmerica, where we have more evidence of sudden changes of level than\r\nanywhere else. He has not, however, attempted to estimate the probable\r\nrate of secular elevation in that or any other region.\r\n\r\nLittle progress has yet been made in divining the most probable causes\r\nof these great movements of the earth's crust; yet what little we\r\nknow of the state of the interior leads us to expect that the gradual\r\nexpansion or contraction of large portions of the solid crust may be\r\nthe result of fluctuations in temperature, with which the existence\r\nof hundreds of active and thousands of extinct volcanoes is probably\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained that solid rocks, such as granite and sandstone,\r\nexpand and contract annually, even under such a moderate range of\r\ntemperature as that of a Canadian winter and summer. If the heat should\r\ngo on increasing through a thickness, say only of 10 miles of the\r\nearth's crust, the gradual upheaval of the incumbent mass may amount to\r\nmany hundreds of feet; and the elevation may be carried still farther,\r\nby the complete fusion of part of the inferior rocks.\r\n\r\nAccording to the experiments of Deville, the contraction of granite, in\r\npassing from a melted, or as some would say its plastic condition, to a\r\nsolid state, must be more than 10 per cent.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Bull. Societe Geologique France\" 2nd series volume 4\r\n     page 1312.)\r\n\r\nSo that we have at our command a source of depression on a grand scale,\r\nat every period when granitic rocks have originated in the interior\r\nof the earth's crust. All mineralogists are agreed that the passage of\r\nvoluminous masses, from a liquid or pasty to a solid and crystalline\r\nstate, must be an extremely slow process. It may often happen that, in\r\nthe same series of superimposed rocks, some are expanding while still\r\nsolid or while partially melting, while others are at the same time\r\ncrystallising and contracting; so that the alterations of level at\r\nthe surface may be the result of complicated and often of conflicting\r\nagencies. The more gradually we conceive such changes to take place, the\r\nmore comprehensible they become in the eyes of the chemist and natural\r\nphilosopher who speculates on the changes of the earth's interior; and\r\nthe more fertile are they in the hands of the geologist in accounting\r\nfor revolutions on the habitable surface.\r\n\r\nWe may presume, that after the movement has gone on for a long time\r\nin one determinate direction, whether of elevation or depression, the\r\nchange to an opposite movement, implying the substitution of a heating\r\nfor a refrigerating operation, or the reverse, would not take place\r\nsuddenly; but would be marked by a period of inaction, or of slight\r\nmovement, or such a state of quiescence, as prevails throughout large\r\nareas of dry land in the normal condition of the globe.\r\n\r\nI see no reason for supposing that any part of the revolutions in\r\nphysical geography, to which the maps above described have reference,\r\nindicate any catastrophes greater than those which the present\r\ngeneration has witnessed. If Man was in existence when the Cromer forest\r\nwas becoming submerged, he would have felt no more alarm than the Danish\r\nsettlers on the east coast of Baffin's Bay, when they found the poles,\r\nwhich they had driven into the beach to secure their boats, had subsided\r\nbelow their original level.\r\n\r\nAlready, perhaps, the melting ice has thrown down till and boulders\r\nupon those poles, a counterpart of the boulder clay which overlies the\r\nforest-bed on the Norfolk cliffs.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that all the plants and shells, marine and freshwater,\r\nof the forest bed, and associated fluvio-marine strata of Norfolk,\r\nare specifically identical with those of the living European flora and\r\nfauna; so that if upon such a stratum a deposit of the present period,\r\nwhether freshwater or marine, should be thrown down, it might lie\r\nconformably over it, and contain the same invertebrate fauna and flora.\r\nThe strata so superimposed would, in ordinary geological language, be\r\ncalled contemporaneous, not only as belonging to the same epoch, but as\r\nappertaining strictly to the same subdivision of one and the same\r\nepoch; although they would in fact have been separated by an interval of\r\nseveral hundred thousand years.\r\n\r\nIf, in the lower of the two formations, some of the mammalia of the\r\ngenera elephant and rhinoceros were found to be distinct in species\r\nfrom those of the same genera in the upper or \"recent\" stratum, it might\r\nappear as though there had been a sudden coming in of new forms, and a\r\nsudden dying out of old ones; for there would not have been time in the\r\ninterval for any perceptible change in the invertebrate fauna, by which\r\nalone we usually measure the lapse of time in the older formations.\r\n\r\nWhen we are contrasting the vertebrate contents of two sets of\r\nsuperimposed strata of the Cretaceous, Oolitic, or any other ancient\r\nformation in which the shells are identical in species, we ought never\r\nto lose sight of the possibility of their having been separated by such\r\nintervals or by two or three thousand centuries. That number of years\r\nmay sometimes be of small moment in reference to the rate of fluctuation\r\nof species in the lower animals, but very important when the succession\r\nof forms in the highest classes of vertebrata is concerned.\r\n\r\nIf we reflect on the long series of events of the Pleistocene and Recent\r\nperiods contemplated in this chapter, it will be remarked that the\r\ntime assigned to the first appearance of Man, so far as our geological\r\ninquiries have yet gone, is extremely modern in relation to the age\r\nof the existing fauna and flora, or even to the time when most of the\r\nliving species of animals and plants attained their actual geographical\r\ndistribution. At the same time it will also be seen, that if the advent\r\nof Man in Europe occurred before the close of the second continental\r\nperiod, and antecedently to the separation of Ireland from England and\r\nof England from the Continent, the event would be sufficiently remote to\r\ncause the historical period to appear quite insignificant in duration,\r\nwhen compared to the antiquity of the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15. -- EXTINCT GLACIERS OF THE ALPS AND THEIR CHRONOLOGICAL\r\nRELATION TO THE HUMAN PERIOD.\r\n\r\n  Extinct Glaciers of Switzerland.\r\n  Alpine Erratic Blocks on the Jura.\r\n  Not transported by floating Ice.\r\n  Extinct Glaciers of the Italian Side of the Alps.\r\n  Theory of the Origin of Lake-Basins by the erosive Action of\r\n     Glaciers considered.\r\n  Successive phases in the Development of Glacial Action in the Alps.\r\n  Probable Relation of these to the earliest known Date of Man.\r\n  Correspondence of the same with successive Changes in the Glacial\r\n     Condition of the Scandinavian and British Mountains.\r\n  Cold Period in Sicily and Syria.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTINCT GLACIERS OF SWITZERLAND.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the preceding chapters that the mountains of\r\nScandinavia, Scotland, and North Wales have served, during the glacial\r\nperiod, as so many independent centres for the dispersion of erratic\r\nblocks, just as at present the ice-covered continent of North Greenland\r\nis sending down ice in all directions to the coast, and filling Baffin's\r\nBay with floating bergs, many of them laden with fragments of rocks.\r\n\r\nAnother great European centre of ice-action during the Pleistocene\r\nperiod was the Alps of Switzerland, and I shall now proceed to consider\r\nthe chronological relations of the extinct Alpine glaciers to those of\r\nmore northern countries previously treated of. [32]\r\n\r\nThe Alps lie far south of the limits of the northern drift described in\r\nthe foregoing pages, being situated between the 44th and 47th degrees of\r\nnorth latitude. On the flanks of these mountains, and on the sub-Alpine\r\nranges of hills or plains adjoining them, those appearances which have\r\nbeen so often alluded to, as distinguishing or accompanying the drift,\r\nbetween the 50th and 70th parallels of north latitude, suddenly reappear\r\nand assume, in a southern region, a truly arctic development. Where the\r\nAlps are highest, the largest erratic blocks have been sent forth; as,\r\nfor example, from the regions of Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa, into the\r\nadjoining parts of Switzerland and Italy; while in districts where the\r\ngreat chain sinks in altitude, as in Carinthia, Carniola, and elsewhere,\r\nno such rocky fragments, or a few only and of smaller bulk, have been\r\ndetached and transported to a distance.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1821, M. Venetz first announced his opinion that the Alpine\r\nglaciers must formerly have extended far beyond their present limits,\r\nand the proofs appealed to by him in confirmation of this doctrine were\r\nafterwards acknowledged by M. Charpentier, who strengthened them by new\r\nobservations and arguments, and declared in 1836 his conviction that the\r\nglaciers of the Alps must once have reached as far as the Jura, and have\r\ncarried thither their moraines across the great valley of Switzerland.\r\nM. Agassiz, after several excursions in the Alps with M. Charpentier,\r\nand after devoting himself some years to the study of glaciers,\r\npublished in 1840 an admirable description of them and of the marks\r\nwhich attest the former action of great masses of ice over the entire\r\nsurface of the Alps and the surrounding country.*\r\n\r\n     (* Agassiz, \"Etudes sur les Glaciers et Systeme Glaciaire.\")\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that the surface of every large glacier is strewed over\r\nwith gravel and stones detached from the surrounding precipices by\r\nfrost, rain, lightning, or avalanches. And he described more carefully\r\nthan preceding writers the long lines of these stones, which settle on\r\nthe sides of the glacier, and are called the lateral moraines; those\r\nfound at the lower end of the ice being called terminal moraines.\r\nSuch heaps of earth and boulders every glacier pushes before it when\r\nadvancing, and leaves behind it when retreating. When the Alpine glacier\r\nreaches a lower and a warmer situation, about 3000 or 4000 feet above\r\nthe sea, it melts so rapidly that, in spite of the downward movement\r\nof the mass, it can advance no farther. Its precise limits are variable\r\nfrom year to year, and still more so from century to century; one\r\nexample being on record of a recession of half a mile in a single year.\r\nWe also learn from M. Venetz, that whereas, between the eleventh and\r\nfifteenth centuries, all the Alpine glaciers were less advanced than\r\nnow, they began in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to push\r\nforward, so as to cover roads formerly open, and to overwhelm forests of\r\nancient growth.\r\n\r\nThese oscillations enable the geologist to note the marks which a\r\nglacier leaves behind it as it retrogrades; and among these the most\r\nprominent, as before stated, are the terminal moraines, or mounds of\r\nunstratified earth and stones, often divided by subsequent floods into\r\nhillocks, which cross the valley like ancient earthworks, or embankments\r\nmade to dam up a river. Some of these transverse barriers were formerly\r\npointed out by Saussure below the glacier of the Rhone, as proving how\r\nfar it had once transgressed its present boundaries. On these moraines\r\nwe see many large angular fragments, which, having been carried along\r\nthe surface of the ice, have not had their edges worn off by friction;\r\nbut the greater number of the boulders, even those of large size, have\r\nbeen well rounded, not by the power of water, but by the mechanical\r\nforce of the ice, which has pushed them against each other, or against\r\nthe rocks flanking the valley. Others have fallen down the numerous\r\nfissures which intersect the glacier, where, being subject to the\r\npressure of the whole mass of ice, they have been forced along, and\r\neither well rounded or ground down into sand, or even the finest mud, of\r\nwhich the moraine is largely constituted.\r\n\r\nAs the terminal moraines are the most prominent of all the monuments\r\nleft by a receding glacier, so are they the most liable to obliteration;\r\nfor violent floods or debacles are sometimes occasioned in the Alps by\r\nthe sudden bursting of glacier-lakes, or those temporary sheets of water\r\nbefore alluded to which are caused by the damming up of a river by a\r\nglacier which has increased during a succession of cold seasons, and\r\ndescending from a tributary into the main valley, has crossed it from\r\nside to side. On the failure of this icy barrier the accumulated waters,\r\nbeing let loose, sweep away and level many a transverse mound of gravel\r\nand loose boulders below, and spread their materials in confused and\r\nirregular beds over the river-plain.\r\n\r\nAnother mark of the former action of glaciers in situations where they\r\nexist no longer, is the polished, striated, and grooved surfaces of\r\nrocks before described. Stones which lie underneath the glacier and are\r\npushed along by it sometimes adhere to the ice, and as the mass glides\r\nslowly along at the rate of a few inches, or at the utmost 2 or 3 feet\r\nper day, abrade, groove, and polish the rock, and the larger blocks are\r\nreciprocally grooved and polished by the rock on their lower sides. As\r\nthe forces both of pressure and propulsion are enormous, the sand acting\r\nlike emery polishes the surface; the pebbles, like coarse gravers,\r\nscratch and furrow it; and the large stones scoop out grooves in it.\r\nLastly, projecting eminences of rock, called \"roches moutonnees,\" are\r\nsmoothed and worn into the shape of flattened domes where the glaciers\r\nhave passed over them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the surface of almost every kind of rock when exposed to the\r\nopen air wastes away by decomposition, yet some retain for ages their\r\npolished and furrowed exterior: and if they are well protected by\r\na covering of clay or turf, these marks of abrasion seem capable of\r\nenduring for ever. They have been traced in the Alps to great heights\r\nabove the present glaciers, and to great horizontal distances beyond\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of a glacier is to lodge a ring of stones round the\r\nsummit of a conical peak which may happen to project through the ice.\r\nIf the glacier is lowered greatly by melting, these circles of large\r\nangular fragments, which are called \"perched blocks,\" are left in a\r\nsingular situation near the top of a steep hill or pinnacle, the lower\r\nparts of which may be destitute of boulders.\r\n\r\n\r\nALPINE ERRATIC BLOCKS ON THE JURA.\r\n\r\nNow some or all the marks above enumerated,--the moraines, erratics,\r\npolished surfaces, domes, striae, and perched rocks--are observed in\r\nthe Alps at great heights above the present glaciers and far below their\r\nactual extremities; also in the great valley of Switzerland, 50 miles\r\nbroad; and almost everywhere on the Jura, a chain which lies to the\r\nnorth of this valley. The average height of the Jura is about one-third\r\nthat of the Alps, and it is now entirely destitute of glaciers; yet it\r\npresents almost everywhere moraines, and polished and grooved surfaces\r\nof rocks. The erratics, moreover, which cover it present a phenomenon\r\nwhich has astonished and perplexed the geologist for more than half a\r\ncentury. No conclusion can be more incontestable than that these angular\r\nblocks of granite, gneiss, and other crystalline formations, came from\r\nthe Alps, and that they have been brought for a distance of 50 miles and\r\nupwards across one of the widest and deepest valleys of the world; so\r\nthat they are now lodged on the hills and valleys of a chain composed\r\nof limestone and other formations, altogether distinct from those of\r\nthe Alps. Their great size and angularity, after a journey of so many\r\nleagues, has justly excited wonder, for hundreds of them are as large\r\nas cottages; and one in particular, composed of gneiss, celebrated under\r\nthe name of Pierre a Bot, rests on the side of a hill about 900 feet\r\nabove the lake of Neufchatel, and is no less than 40 feet in diameter.\r\nBut there are some far-transported masses of granite and gneiss which\r\nare still larger, and which have been found to contain 50,000 and 60,000\r\ncubic feet of stone; and one limestone block at Devens, near Bex, which\r\nhas travelled 30 miles, contains 161,000 cubic feet, its angles being\r\nsharp and unworn.\r\n\r\nVon Buch, Escher, and Studer inferred, from an examination of the\r\nmineral composition of the boulders, that those resting on the Jura,\r\nopposite the lakes of Geneva and Neufchatel, have come from the region\r\nof Mont Blanc and the Valais, as if they had followed the course of\r\nthe Rhone to the lake of Geneva, and had then pursued their way\r\nuninterruptedly in a northerly direction.\r\n\r\nM. Charpentier, who conceived the Alps in the period of greatest cold to\r\nhave been higher by several thousand feet than they are now, had already\r\nsuggested that the Alpine glaciers once reached continuously to the\r\nJura, conveying thither the large erratics in question.*\r\n\r\n     (* D'Archiac, \"Histoire des Progres\" etc. volume 2 page\r\n     249.)\r\n\r\nM. Agassiz, on the other hand, instead of introducing distinct and\r\nseparate glaciers, imagined that the whole valley of Switzerland might\r\nhave been filled with ice, and that one great sheet of it extended from\r\nthe Alps to the Jura, the two chains being of the same height as\r\nnow relatively to each other. To this idea it was objected that the\r\ndifference of altitude, when distributed over a space of 50 miles, would\r\ngive an inclination of two degrees only, or far less than that of any\r\nknown glacier. In spite of this difficulty, the hypothesis has since\r\nreceived the support of Professor James Forbes in his very able work on\r\nthe Alps published in 1843.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, I advanced jointly with Mr. Darwin* the theory that the\r\nerratics may have been transferred by floating ice to the Jura, at the\r\ntime when the greater part of that chain and the whole of the Swiss\r\nvalley to the south was under the sea.\r\n\r\n     (* See \"Elements of Geology\" 2nd edition 1841.)\r\n\r\nWe pointed out that if at that period the Alps had attained only half\r\ntheir present altitude they would yet have constituted a chain as lofty\r\nas the Chilean Andes, which in a latitude corresponding to Switzerland\r\nnow send down glaciers to the head of every sound, from which icebergs\r\ncovered with blocks of granite are floated seaward. Opposite that part\r\nof Chile where the glaciers abound is situated the island of Chiloe\r\n100 miles in length with a breadth of 30 miles, running parallel to\r\nthe continent. The channel which separates it from the main land is of\r\nconsiderable depth and 25 miles broad. Parts of its surface, like the\r\nadjacent coast of Chile, are overspread with Recent marine shells,\r\nshowing an upheaval of the land during a very modern period; and beneath\r\nthese shells is a boulder deposit in which Mr. Darwin found large blocks\r\nof granite and syenite which had evidently come from the Andes.\r\n\r\nA continuance in future of the elevatory movement now observed to be\r\ngoing on in this region of the Andes and of Chiloe might cause the\r\nformer chain to rival the Alps in altitude and give to Chiloe a height\r\nequal to that of the Jura. The same rise might dry up the channel\r\nbetween Chiloe and the main land so that it would then represent the\r\ngreat valley of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nSir Roderick I. Murchison, after making several important geological\r\nsurveys of the Alps, proposed in 1849 a theory agreeing essentially with\r\nthat suggested by Mr. Darwin and myself, namely that the erratics were\r\ntransported to the Jura at a time when the great strath of Switzerland\r\nand many valleys receding far into the Alps were under water. He thought\r\nit impossible that the glacial detritus of the Rhone could ever have\r\nbeen carried to the Lake of Geneva and beyond it by a glacier, or that\r\nso vast a body of ice issuing from one narrow valley could have spread\r\nits erratics over the low country of the cantons of Vaud, Fribourg,\r\nBerne, and Soleure, as well as the slopes of the Jura, comprising a\r\nregion of about 100 miles in breadth from south-west to north-east, as\r\nlaid down in the map of Charpentier. He therefore imagined the granitic\r\nblocks to have been translated to the Jura by ice-floats when the\r\nintermediate country was submerged.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 6\r\n     1850 page 65.)\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that this theory, provided the water be assumed to\r\nhave been salt or brackish, demands quite as great an oscillation in the\r\nlevel of the land as that on which Charpentier had speculated, the only\r\ndifference being that the one hypothesis requires us to begin with a\r\nsubsidence of 2500 or 3000 feet, and the other with an elevation to the\r\nsame amount. We should also remember that the crests or watersheds of\r\nthe Alps and Jura are about 80 miles apart, and if once we suppose them\r\nto have been in movement during the glacial period it is very probable\r\nthat the movements at such a distance may not have been strictly\r\nuniform. If so the Alps may have been relatively somewhat higher, which\r\nwould have greatly facilitated the extension of Alpine glaciers to the\r\nflanks of the less elevated chain.\r\n\r\nFive years before the publication of the memoir last mentioned, M. Guyot\r\nhad brought forward a great body of new facts in support of the original\r\ndoctrine of Charpentier, that the Alpine glaciers once reached as far\r\nas the Jura and that they had deposited thereon a portion of their\r\nmoraines.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Bulletin de la Societe des Sciences Naturelles de\r\n     Neufchatel\" 1845.)\r\n\r\nThe scope of his observations and argument was laid with great clearness\r\nbefore the British public in 1852 by Mr. Charles Maclaren, who had\r\nhimself visited Switzerland for the sake of forming an independent\r\nopinion on a theoretical question of so much interest and on which so\r\nmany eminent men of science had come to such opposite conclusions.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Edinburgh New Philosophical Magazine\" October 1852.)\r\n\r\nM. Guyot had endeavoured to show that the Alpine erratics, instead\r\nof being scattered at random over the Jura and the great plain of\r\nSwitzerland, are arranged in a certain determinate order strictly\r\nanalogous to that which ought to prevail if they had once constituted\r\nthe lateral, medial, and terminal moraines of great glaciers. The rocks\r\nchiefly relied on as evidence of this distribution consist of three\r\nvarieties of granite, besides gneiss, chlorite-slate, euphotide,\r\nserpentine, and a peculiar kind of conglomerate, all of them foreign\r\nalike to the great Strath between the Alps and Jura and to the structure\r\nof the Jura itself. In these two regions limestones, sandstones, and\r\nclays of the Secondary and Tertiary formations alone crop out at the\r\nsurface, so that the travelled fragments of Alpine origin can easily be\r\ndistinguished and in some cases the precise localities pointed out from\r\nwhence they must have come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 42. Map of Ancient Glacier]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 42. MAP SHOWING THE SUPPOSED COURSE OF THE ANCIENT AND NOW\r\n   EXTINCT GLACIER OF THE RHONE, AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE ERRATIC\r\n   BLOCKS AND DRIFT CONVEYED BY IT TO THE GREAT VALLEY OF SWITZERLAND\r\n   AND THE JURA.)\r\n\r\nThe accompanying map or diagram (Figure 42) slightly altered from one\r\ngiven by Mr. Maclaren will enable the reader more fully to appreciate\r\nthe line of argument relied on by M. Guyot. The dotted area is that over\r\nwhich the Alpine fragments were spread by the supposed extinct glacier\r\nof the Rhone. The site of the present reduced glacier of that name is\r\nshown at A. From that point the boulders may first be traced to B, or\r\nMartigny, where the valley takes an abrupt turn at right angles to its\r\nformer course. Here the blocks belonging to the right side of the river\r\nor derived from c d e have not crossed over to the left side at B, as\r\nthey should have done had they been transported by floating ice, but\r\ncontinue to keep to the side to which they belonged, assuming that they\r\nonce formed part of a right lateral moraine of a great extinct glacier.\r\nThat glacier, after arriving at the lower end of the long narrow valley\r\nof the upper Rhone at F, filled the Lake of Geneva, F, I, with ice. From\r\nF, as from a great vomitory, it then radiated in all directions bearing\r\nalong with it the moraines with which it was loaded and spreading them\r\nout on all sides over the great plain. But the principal icy mass moved\r\nstraight onwards in a direct line towards the hill of Chasseron, G\r\n(precisely opposite F), where the Alpine erratics attain their maximum\r\nof height on the Jura, that is to say 2015 English feet above the level\r\nof the Lake of Neufchatel or 3450 feet above the sea. The granite blocks\r\nwhich have ascended to this eminence G came from the east shoulder of\r\nMont Blanc h, having travelled in the direction B, F, G.\r\n\r\nWhen these and the accompanying blocks resting on the south-eastern\r\ndeclivity of the Jura are traced from their culminating point G in\r\nopposite directions, whether westward towards Geneva or eastwards\r\ntowards Soleure, they are found to decline in height from the middle of\r\nthe arc G towards the two extremities I and K, both of which are at a\r\nlower level than G, by about 1500 feet. In other words the ice of the\r\nextinct glacier, having mounted up on the sloping flanks of the Jura in\r\nthe line of greatest pressure to its highest elevation, began to decline\r\nlaterally in the manner of a pliant or viscous mass with a gentle\r\ninclination till it reached two points distant from each other no less\r\nthan 100 miles. [33]\r\n\r\nIn further confirmation of this theory M. Guyot observed that fragments\r\nderived from the right bank of the great valley of the Rhone c d e are\r\nfound on the right side of the great Swiss basin or Strath as at l and\r\nm, while those derived from the left bank p h occur on the left side of\r\nthe basin or on the Jura between G and I; and those again derived from\r\nplaces farthest up on the left bank and nearest the source of the Rhone,\r\nas n o, occupy the middle of the great basin, constituting between m\r\nand K what M. Guyot calls the frontal or terminal moraine of the eastern\r\nprolongation of the old glacier.\r\n\r\nA huge boulder of talcose granite, now at Steinhoff, 10 miles east from\r\nK, or Soleure, containing 61,000 French cubic feet, or equal in bulk\r\nto a mass measuring 40 feet in every direction, was ascertained by\r\nCharpentier from its composition to have been derived from n, one of the\r\nhighest points on the left side of the Rhone valley far above Martigny.\r\nFrom this spot it must have gone all round by F, which is the only\r\noutlet to the deep valley, so as to have performed a journey of no less\r\nthan 150 miles!\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL TRANSPORTATION OF ERRATICS IN SWITZERLAND DUE TO GLACIERS AND\r\nNOT TO FLOATING ICE.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the above described restriction of certain fragments\r\nof peculiar lithological character to that bank of the Rhone where the\r\nparent rocks are alone met with and the linear arrangement of the\r\nblocks in corresponding order on the opposite side of the great plain of\r\nSwitzerland, are facts which harmonise singularly well with the theory\r\nof glaciers while they are wholly irreconcilable with that of floating\r\nice. Against the latter hypothesis all the arguments which Charpentier\r\noriginally brought forward in opposition to the first popular doctrine\r\nof a grand debacle or sudden flood rushing down from the Alps to the\r\nJura might be revived. Had there ever been such a rush of muddy water,\r\nsaid he, the blocks carried down the basins of the principal Swiss\r\nrivers, such as the Rhone, Aar, Reuss, and Limmat, would all have been\r\nmingled confusedly together instead of having each remained in separate\r\nand distinct areas as they do and should do according to the glacial\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nM. Morlot presented me in 1857 with an unpublished map of Switzerland in\r\nwhich he had embodied the results of his own observations and those\r\nof MM. Guyot, Escher, and others, marking out by distinct colours the\r\nlimits of the ice-transported detritus proper to each of the great\r\nriver-basins. The arrangement of the drift and erratics thus\r\ndepicted accords perfectly well with Charpentier's views and is quite\r\nirreconcilable with the supposition of the scattered blocks having been\r\ndispersed by floating ice when Switzerland was submerged.\r\n\r\nAs opposed to the latter hypothesis, I may also state that nowhere as\r\nyet have any marine shells or other fossils than those of a terrestrial\r\ncharacter, such as the bones of the mammoth and a few other mammalia\r\nand some coniferous wood, been detected in those drifts, though they are\r\noften many hundreds of feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nA glance at M. Morlot's map, above mentioned,* will show that the two\r\nlargest areas, indicated by a single colour, are those over which the\r\nRhone and the Rhine are supposed to have spread out in ancient times\r\ntheir enormous moraines.\r\n\r\n     (* See map, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\"\r\n     volume 18 1862 page 185 Plate 18.)\r\n\r\nOne of these only, that of the Rhone, has been exhibited in our diagram,\r\nFigure 42. The distinct character of the drift in the two cases is such\r\nas it would be if two colossal glaciers should now come down from the\r\nhigher Alps through the valleys traversed by those rivers, leaving their\r\nmoraines in the low country. The space occupied by the glacial drift of\r\nthe Rhine is equal in dimensions or rather exceeds that of the Rhone,\r\nand its course is not interfered with in the least degree by the Lake\r\nof Constance, 45 miles long, any more than is the dispersion of the\r\nerratics of the Rhone by the Lake of Geneva, about 50 miles in length.\r\nThe angular and other blocks have in both instances travelled on\r\nprecisely as if those lakes had no existence, or as if, which was no\r\ndoubt the case, they had been filled with solid ice.\r\n\r\nDuring my last visit to Switzerland in 1857, I made excursions, in\r\ncompany with several distinguished geologists, for the sake of testing\r\nthe relative merits of the two rival theories above referred to, and I\r\nexamined parts of the Jura above Neufchatel in company with M. Desor,\r\nthe country round Soleure with M. Langen, the southern side of the great\r\nstrath near Lausanne with M. Morlot, the basin of the Aar around Berne\r\nwith M. Escher von der Linth; and having satisfied myself that all the\r\nfacts which I saw north of the Alps were in accordance with M. Guyot's\r\nviews, I crossed to the Italian side of the great chain and became\r\nconvinced that the same theory was equally applicable to the ancient\r\nmoraines of the plains of the Po.\r\n\r\nM. Escher pointed out to me at Trogen in Appenzel on the left bank of\r\nthe Rhine fragments of a rock of a peculiar mineralogical character,\r\ncommonly called the granite of Pontelyas, the natural position of which\r\nis well known near Trons, 100 miles from Trogen, on the left bank of the\r\nRhine about 30 miles from the source of that river. All the blocks of\r\nthis peculiar granite keep to the left bank, even where the valley turns\r\nalmost at right angles to its former course near Mayenfeld below Chur,\r\nmaking a sharp bend resembling that of the valley of the Rhone at\r\nMartigny. The granite blocks, where they are traced to the low country,\r\nstill keep to the left side of the Lake of Constance. That they should\r\nnot have crossed over to the opposite river-bank below Chur is quite\r\ninexplicable if, rejecting the aid of land-ice, we appeal to floating\r\nice as the transporting power.\r\n\r\nIn M. Morlot's map already cited we behold between the areas occupied\r\nby the glacial drift of the Rhine and Rhone three smaller yet not\r\ninconsiderable spaces distinguished by distinct colours, indicating\r\nthe peculiar detritus brought down by the three great rivers, the Aar,\r\nReuss, and Limmat. The ancient glacier of the first of these, the\r\nAar, has traversed the lakes of Brienz and Thun and has borne angular,\r\npolished, and striated blocks of limestone and other rocks as far as\r\nBerne and somewhat below that city. The Reuss has also stamped the\r\nlithological character of its own mountainous region upon the lower\r\npart of its hydrographical basin by covering it with its peculiar Alpine\r\ndrift. In like manner the old extinct glacier of the Limmat during its\r\ngradual retreat has left monuments of its course in the Lake of Zurich\r\nin the shape of terminal moraines, one of which has almost divided that\r\ngreat sheet of water into two lakes.\r\n\r\nThe ice-work done by the extinct glaciers, as contrasted with that\r\nperformed by their dwarfed representatives of the present day, is in due\r\nproportion to the relative volume of the supposed glaciers, whether we\r\nmeasure them by the distances to which they have carried erratic\r\nblocks or the areas which they have strewed over with drift or the hard\r\nsurfaces of rock and number of boulders which they have polished and\r\nstriated. Instead of a length of 5, 10, or 20 miles and a thickness of\r\n200, 300, or at the utmost 800 feet, those giants of the olden time must\r\nhave been from 50 to 150 miles long and between 1000 and 3000 feet deep.\r\nIn like manner the glaciation although identical in kind is on so small\r\na scale in the existing Alpine glaciers as at first sight to disappoint\r\na Swedish, Scotch, Welsh, or North American geologist. When I visited\r\nthe terminal moraine of the glacier of the Rhone in 1859 and tried\r\nto estimate the number of angular or rounded pebbles and blocks which\r\nexhibited glacial polishing or scratches as compared to those bearing no\r\nsuch markings, I found that several thousand had to be reckoned before I\r\narrived at the first which was so striated or polished as to differ\r\nfrom the stones of an ordinary torrent-bed. Even in the moraines of the\r\nglaciers of Zermatt, Viesch, and others, in which fragments of limestone\r\nand serpentine are abundant (rocks which most readily receive and most\r\nfaithfully retain the signs of glaciation), I found, for one which\r\ndisplayed such indications, several hundreds entirely free from them.\r\nOf the most opposite character were the results obtained by me from a\r\nsimilar scrutiny of the boulders and pebbles of the terminal moraine\r\nof one of the old extinct glaciers, namely, that of the Rhone in\r\nthe suburbs of Soleure. Thus at the point K in the map, Figure 42, I\r\nobserved a mass of unstratified clay or mud, through which a variety of\r\nangular and rubbed stones were scattered and a marked proportion of the\r\nwhole were polished and scratched and the clay rendered so compact, as\r\nif by the incumbent pressure of a great mass of ice, that it has been\r\nfound necessary to blow it up with gunpowder in making railway cuttings\r\nthrough part of it. A limestone of the age of our Portland stone\r\non which this old moraine rests, has its surface polished like a\r\nlooking-glass, displaying beautiful sections of fossil shells of the\r\ngenera Nerinaea and Pteroceras, while occasionally, besides finer\r\nstriae, there are deep rectilinear grooves, agreeing in direction with\r\nthe course in which the extinct glacier would have moved according to\r\nthe theory of M. Guyot, before explained.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTINCT GLACIERS OF THE ITALIAN SIDE OF THE ALPS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 43. Map Of The Moraines Of Extinct Glaciers]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 43. MAP OF THE MORAINES OF EXTINCT GLACIERS\r\n   EXTENDING FROM THE ALPS INTO THE PLAINS OF THE PO NEAR TURIN.\r\n   From Map of the ancient Glaciers of the Italian side of the Alps\r\n     by Signor Gabriel de Mortillet.\r\n\r\n  A. Crest or watershed of the Alps.\r\n  B. Snow-covered Alpine summits which fed the ancient glaciers.\r\n  C. Moraines of ancient or extinct glaciers.)\r\n\r\nTo select another example from the opposite or southern side of the\r\nAlps. It will be seen in the elaborate map recently executed by Signor\r\nGabriel de Mortillet of the ancient glaciers of the Italian flank of\r\nthe Alps that the old moraines descend in narrow strips from the\r\nsnow-covered ridges through the principal valleys to the great basin of\r\nthe Po, on reaching which they expand and cover large circular or oval\r\nareas. Each of these groups of detritus is observed (see map, Figure 43)\r\nto contain exclusively the wreck of such rocks as occur in situ on\r\nthe Alpine heights of the hydrographical basins to which the moraines\r\nrespectively belong.\r\n\r\nI had an opportunity of verifying this fact, in company with Signor\r\nGastaldi as my guide, by examining the erratics and boulder formation\r\nbetween Susa and Turin, on the banks of the Dora Riparia, which brings\r\ndown the waters from Mont Cenis and from the Alps south-west of it. I\r\nthere observed striated fragments of dolomite and gypsum, which had come\r\ndown from Mont Cenis and had travelled as far as Avigliana; also masses\r\nof serpentine brought from less remote points, some of them apparently\r\nexceeding in dimensions the largest erratics of Switzerland. I\r\nafterwards visited, in company with Signori Gastaldi and Michelotti,\r\na still grander display of the work of a colossal glacier of the olden\r\ntime, 20 miles north-east of Turin, the moraine of which descended\r\nfrom the two highest of the Alps, Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa, and after\r\npassing through the valley of Aosta, issued from a narrow defile above\r\nIvrea (see map, Figure 43). From this vomitory the old glacier poured\r\ninto the plains of the Po that wonderful accumulation of mud, gravel,\r\nboulders, and large erratics, which extend for 15 miles from above\r\nIvrea to below Caluso and which when seen in profile from Turin have the\r\naspect of a chain of hills. In many countries, indeed, they might rank\r\nas an important range of hills, for where they join the mountains they\r\nare more than 1500 feet high, and retain more than half that height for\r\na great part of their course, rising very abruptly from the plain, often\r\nwith a slope of from 20 to 30 degrees. This glacial drift reposes near\r\nthe mountains on ancient metamorphic rocks and farther from them on\r\nmarine Pliocene strata. Portions of the ridges of till and stratified\r\nmatter have been cut up into mounds and hillocks by the action of the\r\nriver, the Dora Baltea, and there are numerous lakes, so that the entire\r\nmoraine much resembles, except in its greater height and width, the line\r\nof glacial drift of Perthshire and Forfarshire before described. Its\r\ncomplicated structure can only be explained by supposing that the\r\nancient glacier advanced and retreated several times and left large\r\nlateral moraines, the more modern mounds within the limits of the older\r\nones, and masses of till thrown down upon the rearranged and stratified\r\nmaterials of the first set of moraines. Such appearances accord well\r\nwith the hypothesis of the successive phases of glacial action in\r\nSwitzerland, to which I shall presently advert.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTORTED STRATA OF GLACIAL DRIFT SOUTH OF IVREA.\r\n\r\nAt Mazze near Caluso (see Figure 43), the southern extremity of this\r\ngreat moraine has recently been cut through in making a tunnel for the\r\nrailway which runs from Turin to Ivrea. In the fine section thus exposed\r\nSignor Gastaldi and I had an opportunity of observing the internal\r\nstructure of the glacial formation. In close juxtaposition to a\r\ngreat mass of till with striated boulders, we saw stratified beds of\r\nalternating gravel, sand, and loam, which were so sharply bent that many\r\nof them had been twice pierced through in the same vertical cutting.\r\nWhether they had been thus folded by the mechanical power of an\r\nadvancing glacier, which had pushed before it a heap of stratified\r\nmatter, as the glacier of Zermatt has been sometimes known to shove\r\nforward blocks of stone through the walls of houses, or whether the\r\nmelting of masses of ice, once interstratified with sand and gravel, had\r\ngiven rise to flexures in the manner before suggested; it is at least\r\nsatisfactory to have detected this new proof of a close connection\r\nbetween ice-action and contorted stratification, such as has been\r\ndescribed as so common in the Norfolk cliffs and which is also very\r\noften seen in Scotland and North America, where stratified gravel\r\noverlies till. I have little doubt that if the marine Pliocene strata\r\nwhich underlie a great part of the moraine below Ivrea were exposed to\r\nview in a vertical section, those fundamental strata would be found not\r\nto participate in the least degree in the plications of the sands and\r\ngravels of the overlying glacial drift.\r\n\r\nTo return to the marks of glaciation: in the moraine at Mazze there are\r\nmany large blocks of protogine and large and small ones of limestone\r\nand serpentine which have been brought down from Monte Rosa, through\r\nthe gorge of Ivrea, after having travelled for a distance of 50\r\nmiles. Confining my attention to a part of the moraine where pieces of\r\nlimestone and serpentine were very numerous, I found that no less than\r\none-third of the whole number bore unequivocal signs of glacial action;\r\na state of things which seems to bear some relation to the vast volume\r\nand pressure of the ice which once constituted the extinct glacier and\r\nto the distance which the stones had travelled. When I separated the\r\npebbles of quartz, which were never striated, and those of granite,\r\nmica-schist, and diorite, which do not often exhibit glacial markings,\r\nand confined my attention to the serpentine alone I found no less than\r\nnineteen in twenty of the whole number polished and scratched; whereas\r\nin the terminal moraines of some modern glaciers, where the materials\r\nhave travelled not more than 10 or 15, instead of 100 miles, scarce\r\none in twenty even of the serpentine pebbles exhibit glacial polish and\r\nstriation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF LAKE-BASINS BY THE EROSIVE ACTION OF GLACIERS,\r\nCONSIDERED.\r\n\r\nGeologists are all agreed that the last series of movements to which the\r\nAlps owe their present form and internal structure occurred after the\r\ndeposition of the Miocene strata; and it has been usual to refer the\r\norigin of the numerous lake-basins of Alpine and sub-Alpine regions both\r\nin Switzerland and Northern Italy to the same movements; for it\r\nseemed not unnatural to suppose, that forces capable of modifying the\r\nconfiguration of the greatest European chain, by uplifting some of its\r\ncomponent Tertiary strata (those of marine origin of the Miocene period)\r\nseveral thousand feet above their former level, after throwing them\r\ninto vertical and contorted positions, must also have given rise to many\r\nsuperficial inequalities, in some of which large bodies of water would\r\ncollect. M. Desor, in a memoir on the Swiss and Italian lakes, suggested\r\nthat they may have escaped being obliterated by sedimentary deposition\r\nby having been filled with ice during the whole of the glacial period.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to the retreat of the great glaciers we know that the\r\nlake-basins have been to a certain extent encroached upon and turned\r\ninto land by river deltas; one of which, that of the Rhone at the head\r\nof the Lake of Geneva, is no less than 12 miles long and several miles\r\nbroad, besides which there are many torrents on the borders of the same\r\nlake, forming smaller deltas.\r\n\r\nM. Gabriel de Mortillet after a careful study of the glacial formations\r\nof the Alps agreed with his predecessors that the great lakes had\r\nexisted before the glacial period, but came to the opinion in 1859\r\nthat they had all been first filled up with alluvial matter and then\r\nre-excavated by the action of ice, which during the epoch of intense\r\ncold had by its weight and force of propulsion scooped out the loose\r\nand incoherent alluvial strata, even where they had accumulated to a\r\nthickness of 2000 feet. Besides this erosion, the ice had carried the\r\nwhole mass of mud and stones up the inclined planes, from the central\r\ndepths to the lower outlets of the lakes and sometimes far beyond them.\r\nAs some of these rock-basins are 500, others more than 2000 feet deep,\r\nhaving their bottoms in some cases 500, in others 1000 feet below the\r\nlevel of the sea, and having areas from 20 to 50 miles in length and\r\nfrom 4 to 12 in breadth, we may well be startled at the boldness of this\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe following are the facts and train of reasoning which induced M. de\r\nMortillet to embrace these views. At the lower ends of the great\r\nItalian lakes, such as Maggiore, Como, Garda, and others, there are vast\r\nmoraines which are proved by their contents to have come from the upper\r\nAlpine valleys above the lakes. Such moraines often repose on an older\r\nstratified alluvium, made up of rounded and worn pebbles of precisely\r\nthe same rocks as those forming the moraines, but not derived from them,\r\nbeing small in size, never angular, polished, or striated, and the whole\r\nhaving evidently come from a great distance. These older alluvial strata\r\nmust, according to M. de Mortillet, be of pre-glacial date and could\r\nnot have been carried past the sites of the lakes, unless each basin had\r\npreviously been filled and levelled up with mud, sand, and gravel,\r\nso that the river channel was continuous from the upper to the lower\r\nextremity of each basin.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ramsay, after acquiring an intimate knowledge of the glacial\r\nphenomena of the British Isles, had taught many years before that small\r\ntarns and shallow rock-basins such as we see in many mountain regions\r\nowe their origin to glaciers which erode the softer rocks, leaving\r\nthe harder ones standing out in relief and comparatively unabraded.\r\nFollowing up this idea after he had visited Switzerland and without\r\nany communication with M. de Mortillet or cognisance of his views, he\r\nsuggested in 1859 that the lake-basins were not of pre-glacial date, but\r\nhad been scooped out by ice during the glacial period, the excavation\r\nhaving for the most part been effected in Miocene sandstone,\r\nprovincially called, on account of its softness, \"molasse.\" By this\r\ntheory he dispensed with the necessity of filling up pre-existing\r\ncavities with stratified alluvium, in the manner proposed by M. de\r\nMortillet.\r\n\r\nI will now explain to what extent I agree with, and on what points I\r\nfeel compelled to differ from the two distinguished geologists above\r\ncited. First. It is no doubt true, as Professor Ramsay remarks, that\r\nheavy masses of ice, creeping for ages over a surface of dry land\r\n(whether this comprise hills, plateaus, and valleys, as in the case\r\nof Greenland, before described, or be confined to the bottoms of great\r\nvalleys, as now in the higher Alps), must often by their grinding\r\naction produce depressions, in consequence of the different degrees\r\nof resistance offered by rocks of unequal hardness. Thus, for example,\r\nwhere quartzose beds of mica-schist alternate with clay-slate, or where\r\ntrap-dykes, often causing waterfalls in the courses of torrents,\r\ncut through sandstone or slate--these and innumerable other common\r\nassociations of dissimilar stony compounds must give rise to a very\r\nunequal amount of erosion and consequently to lake-basins on a small\r\nscale. But the larger the size of any lake, the more certain it will be\r\nto contain within it rocks of every degree of hardness, toughness, and\r\nsoftness; and if we find a gradual deepening from the head towards the\r\ncentral parts and a shallowing again from the middle to the lower end,\r\nas in several of the great Swiss and Italian lakes, which are 30 or\r\n40 miles in length, we require a power capable of acting with a\r\nconsiderable degree of uniformity on these masses of varying powers of\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nSecondly. Several of the great lakes are by no means in the line of\r\ndirection which they ought to have taken had they been scooped out by\r\nthe pressure and onward movement of the extinct glaciers. The Lake\r\nof Geneva, for instance, had it been the work of ice, would have been\r\nprolonged from the termination of the upper valley of the Rhone towards\r\nthe Jura, in the direction from F to G of the map, Figure 42, instead of\r\nrunning from F to I.\r\n\r\nThirdly. It has been ascertained experimentally, that in a glacier, as\r\nin a river, the rate of motion is accelerated or lessened, according to\r\nthe greater or less slope of the ground; also, that the lower strata of\r\nice, like those of water, move more slowly than those above them. In the\r\nLago Maggiore, which is more than 2600 feet deep (797 metres), the ice,\r\nsays Professor Ramsay, had to descend a slope of about 3 degrees for\r\nthe first 25 miles, and then to ASCEND for the last 12 miles (from the\r\ndeepest part towards the outlet) at an angle of 5 degrees. It is for\r\nthose who are conversant with the dynamics of glacier motion to divine\r\nwhether in such a case the discharge of ice would not be entirely\r\neffected by the superior and faster moving strata, and whether the\r\nlowest would not be motionless or nearly so, and would therefore exert\r\nvery little, if any, friction on the bottom.\r\n\r\nFourthly. But the gravest objection to the hypothesis of glacial erosion\r\non so stupendous a scale is afforded by the entire absence of lakes of\r\nthe first magnitude in several areas where they ought to exist if the\r\nenormous glaciers which once occupied those spaces had possessed the\r\ndeep excavating power ascribed to them. Thus in the area laid down on\r\nthe map, Figure 43, or that covered by the ancient moraine of the Dora\r\nBaltea, we see the monuments of a colossal glacier derived from Mont\r\nBlanc and Monte Rosa, which descended from points nearly 100 miles\r\ndistant, and then emerging from the narrow gorge above Ivrea deployed\r\nupon the plains of the Po, advancing over a floor of marine Pliocene\r\nstrata of no greater solidity than the Miocene sandstone and\r\nconglomerate in which the lake-basins of Geneva, Zurich, and some others\r\nare situated. Why did this glacier fail to scoop out a deep and wide\r\nbasin rivalling in size the lakes of Maggiore or Como, instead of merely\r\ngiving rise to a few ponds above Ivrea, which may have been due to ice\r\naction? There is one lake, it is true--that of Candia, near the southern\r\nextremity of the moraine--which is larger; but even this, as will be\r\nseen by the map, is quite of subordinate importance, and whether it is\r\nsituated in a rock basin or is simply caused by a dam of moraine matter\r\nhas not yet been fully made out.\r\n\r\nThere ought also to have been another great lake, according to the\r\ntheory under consideration, in the space now occupied by the moraine of\r\nthe Dora Riparia, between Susa and Turin (see map, Figure 43). Signor\r\nGastaldi has shown that all the ponds in that area consist exclusively\r\nof what M. de Mortillet has denominated morainic lakes, i.e. caused by\r\nbarriers of glacier-mud and stones.\r\n\r\nFifthly. In proof of the great lakes having had no existence before the\r\nglacial period, Professor Ramsay observes that we do not find in the\r\nAlps any freshwater strata of an age intermediate between \"the close of\r\nthe Miocenic and the commencement of the glacial epoch.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 18\r\n     1862.)\r\n\r\nBut although such formations are scarce, they are by no means wholly\r\nwanting; and if it can be shown that any one of the principal lakes,\r\nthat of Zurich for example, existed prior to the glacial era it will\r\nfollow that in the Alps the erosive power of ice was not required to\r\nproduce lake-basins on a large scale. The deposits alluded to on the\r\nborders of the Lake of Zurich are those of Utznach and Durnten, situated\r\neach about 350 feet above the present level of the lake and containing\r\nvaluable beds of lignite.\r\n\r\nThe first of them, that of Utznach, is a delta formed at the head of\r\nthe ancient and once more extensive lake. The argillaceous and\r\nlignite-bearing strata, more than 100 feet in thickness, rest\r\nunconformably on highly inclined and sometimes vertical Miocene molasse.\r\nThese clays are covered conformably by stratified sand and gravel 60\r\nfeet thick, partly consolidated, in which the pebbles are of rocks\r\nbelonging to the upper valleys of the Limmat and its tributaries, all\r\nof them small and not glacially striated and wholly without admixture\r\nof large angular stones. On the top of all repose very large erratic\r\nblocks, affording clear evidence that the colossal glacier which once\r\nfilled the valley of the Limmat covered the old littoral deposit. The\r\ngreat age of the lignite is partly indicated by the bones of Elephas\r\nantiquus found in it.\r\n\r\nI visited Utznach in company with M. Escher von der Linth in 1857, and\r\nduring the same year examined the lignite of Durnten, many miles farther\r\ndown on the right bank of the lake, in company with Professor Heer and\r\nM. Marcou. The beds there are of the same age and within a few feet of\r\nthe same height above the level of the lake. They might easily have\r\nbeen overlooked or confounded with the general glacial drift of the\r\nneighbourhood, had not the bed of lignite, which is from 5 to 12 feet\r\nthick, been worked for fuel, during which operation many organic remains\r\ncame to light. Among these are the teeth of Elephas antiquus, determined\r\nby Dr. Falconer, and Rhinoceros leptorhinus? (R. megarhinus, Christol),\r\nthe wild bull and red deer (Bos primigenius, Boj., and Cervus elaphus,\r\nL.), the last two determined by Professor Rutimeyer. In the same beds I\r\nfound many freshwater shells of the genera Paludina, Limnaea, etc., all\r\nof living species. The plants named by Professor Heer are also Recent\r\nand agree singularly with those of the Cromer buried forest, before\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nAmong them are the Scotch and spruce firs, Pinus sylvestris and Pinus\r\nabies, and the buckbean, or Menyanthes trifoliata, etc., besides the\r\ncommon birch and other European plants.\r\n\r\nOverlying this lignite are first, as at Utznach, stratified gravel not\r\nof glacial origin, about 30 feet thick; and secondly, highest of all,\r\nhuge angular erratic blocks clearly indicating the presence of a great\r\nglacier posterior in date to all the organic remains above enumerated.\r\n\r\nIf any one of the existing Swiss lakes were now lowered by deepening its\r\noutlet, or by raising the higher portion of it relatively to the lower,\r\nwe should see similar deltas of comparatively modern date exposed to\r\nview, some of them with embedded trunks of pines of the same species\r\ndrifted down during freshets. Such deposits would be most frequent at\r\nthe upper ends of the lakes, but a few would occur on either bank not\r\nfar from the shore where torrents once entered, agreeing in geographical\r\nposition with the lignite formations of Utznach and Durnten.\r\n\r\nThere are other freshwater formations with lignite, besides those on\r\nthe Lake of Zurich, as those of Wetzikon near the Pfaffikon Lake, of\r\nKaltbrunnen, of Buchberg, and that of Morschweil between St. Gall and\r\nRorschach, but none probably older than the Durnten beds. Like the\r\nburied forest of Cromer they are all pre-glacial, yet they by no means\r\nrepresent the older nor even the newer Pliocene period, but rather the\r\nbeginning of the Pleistocene. It is therefore true, as Professor Ramsay\r\nremarks, that, as yet, no strata \"of the age of the English Crag\"\r\nhave been detected in any Alpine valley. In other words, there are no\r\nfreshwater formations yet known corresponding in date to the Pliocene\r\nbeds of the upper Val d'Arno, above Florence--a fact from which we may\r\ninfer (though with diffidence, as the inference is based on negative\r\nevidence), that, although the great Alpine valleys were eroded in\r\nPliocene times, the lake-basins were, nevertheless, of Pleistocene\r\ndate--some of them formed before, others during, the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nSixthly. In what manner then did the great lake-basins originate if they\r\nwere not hollowed out by ice? My answer is, they are all due to unequal\r\nmovements of upheaval and subsidence. We have already seen that the\r\nburied forest of Cromer, which by its organic contents seems clearly to\r\nbe of the same age as the lignite of Durnten, was pre-glacial and that\r\nit has undergone a great oscillation of level (about 500 feet in both\r\ndirections) since its origin, having first sunk to that extent below\r\nthe sea and then been raised up again to the sea-level. In the countless\r\nPost-Miocene ages which preceded the glacial period there was ample time\r\nfor the slow erosion by water of all the principal hydrographical basins\r\nof the Alps, and the sites of all the great lakes coincide, as Professor\r\nRamsay truly says, with these great lines of drainage. The lake-cavities\r\ndo not lie in synclinal troughs, following the strike and foldings of\r\nthe strata, but often, as the same geologist remarks, cross them at high\r\nangles; nor are they due to rents or gaping fissures, although these,\r\nwith other accidents connected with the disturbing movements of the\r\nAlps, may sometimes have determined originally the direction of the\r\nvalleys. The conformity of the lake-basins to the principal watercourses\r\nis explicable if we assume them to have resulted from inequalities in\r\nthe upward and downward movements of the whole country in Pleistocene\r\ntimes, after the valleys were eroded.\r\n\r\nWe know that in Sweden the rate of the rise of the land is far from\r\nuniform, being only a few inches in a century near Stockholm, while\r\nnorth of it and beyond Gefle it amounts to as many feet in the same\r\nnumber of years. Let us suppose with Charpentier that the Alps gained\r\nin height several thousand feet at the time when the intense cold of\r\nthe glacial period was coming on. This gradual rise would be an era of\r\naqueous erosion and of the deepening, widening, and lengthening of the\r\nvalleys. It is very improbable that the elevation would be everywhere\r\nidentical in quantity, but if it was never in excess in the outskirts as\r\ncompared to the central region or crest of the chain, it would not give\r\nrise to lakes. When, however, the period of upheaval was followed by\r\none of gradual subsidence, the movement not being everywhere strictly\r\nuniform, lake-basins would be formed wherever the rate of depression was\r\nin excess in the upper country. Let the region, for example, near the\r\nhead waters of the great rivers sink at the rate of from 4 to 6 feet\r\nper century, while only half as much subsidence occurs towards the\r\ncircumference of the mountains--the rate diminishing about an inch per\r\nmile in a distance, say of 40 miles--this might convert many of the\r\nlargest and deepest valleys at their lower ends into lakes.\r\n\r\nWe have no certainty that such movements may not now be in progress in\r\nthe Alps; for if they are as slow as we have assumed, they would be as\r\ninsensible to the inhabitants as is the upheaval of Scandinavia or the\r\nsubsidence of Greenland to the Swedes and Danes who dwell there. They\r\nonly know of the progress of such geographical revolutions because a\r\nslight change of level becomes manifest on the margin of the sea. The\r\nlines of elevation or depression above supposed might leave no clear\r\ngeological traces of their action on the high ridges and table-lands\r\nseparating the valleys of the principal rivers; it is only when\r\nthey cross such valleys that the disturbance caused in the course of\r\nthousands of years in the drainage becomes apparent. If there were no\r\nice, the sinking of the land might not give rise to lakes. To accomplish\r\nthis in the absence of ice, it is necessary that the rate of depression\r\nshould be sufficiently fast to make it impossible for the depositing\r\npower of the river to keep pace with it, or in other words to fill\r\nup the incipient cavity as fast as it begins to form. Such levelling\r\noperations once complete, the running water, aided by sand and pebbles,\r\nwill gradually cut a gorge through the newly raised rock so as to\r\nprevent it from forming a barrier. But if a great glacier fill the\r\nlower part of the valley all the conditions of the problem are altered.\r\nInstead of the mud, sand, and stones drifted down from the higher\r\nregions being left behind in the incipient basin, they all travel\r\nonwards in the shape of moraines on the top of the ice, passing over\r\nand beyond the new depression, so that when at the end of fifty or\r\na thousand centuries the glacier melts, a large and deep basin\r\nrepresenting the difference in the movement of two adjoining mountain\r\nareas--namely, the central and the circumferential--is for the first\r\ntime rendered visible.\r\n\r\nBy adopting this hypothesis, we concede that there is an intimate\r\nconnection between the glacial period and a predominance of lakes, in\r\nproducing which the action of ice is threefold; first, by its direct\r\npower in scooping out shallow basins where the rocks are of unequal\r\nhardness; an operation which can by no means be confined to the land,\r\nfor it must extend to below the level of high water a thousand feet\r\nand more in such fjords as have been described as filled with ice in\r\nGreenland.\r\n\r\nSecondly. The ice will act indirectly by preventing cavities caused by\r\ninequalities of subsidence or elevation from becoming the receptacles\r\nfirst of water and then of sediment, by which the cavities would be\r\nlevelled up and the lakes obliterated.\r\n\r\nThirdly. The ice is also an indirect cause of lakes, by heaping up\r\nmounds of moraine matter and thus giving rise to ponds and even to\r\nsheets of water several miles in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe comparative scarcity, therefore, of lakes of Pleistocene date\r\nin tropical countries, and very generally south of the fortieth and\r\nfiftieth parallels of latitude, may be accounted for by the absence of\r\nglacial action in such regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-GLACIAL LAKE-DWELLING IN THE NORTH OF ITALY.\r\n\r\nWe learn from M. de Mortillet that in the peat which has filled up one\r\nof the \"morainic lakes\" formed by the ancient glacier of the Ticino, M.\r\nMoro has discovered at Mercurago the piles of a lake-dwelling like those\r\nof Switzerland, together with various utensils and a canoe hollowed out\r\nof the trunk of a tree. From this fact we learn that south of the\r\nAlps as well as north of them a primitive people having similar habits\r\nflourished after the retreat of the great glaciers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESSIVE PHASES OF GLACIAL ACTION IN THE ALPS, AND THEIR RELATION TO\r\nTHE HUMAN PERIOD [34].\r\n\r\nAccording to the geological observations of M. Morlot, the following\r\nsuccessive phases in the development of ice-action in the Alps are\r\nplainly recognisable:--\r\n\r\nFirst. There was a period when the ice was in its greatest excess, when\r\nthe glacier of the Rhone not only reached the Jura, but climbed to the\r\nheight of 2015 feet above the Lake of Neufchatel, and 3450 feet above\r\nthe sea, at which time the Alpine ice actually entered the French\r\nterritory at some points, penetrating by certain gorges, as through the\r\ndefile of the Fort de l'Ecluse, among others.\r\n\r\nSecond. To this succeeded a prolonged retreat of the great glaciers,\r\nwhen they evacuated not only the Jura and the low country between that\r\nchain and the Alps, but retired some way back into the Alpine valleys.\r\nM. Morlot supposes their diminution in volume to have accompanied a\r\ngeneral subsidence of the country to the extent of at least 1000 feet.\r\nThe geological formations of the second period consist of stratified\r\nmasses of sand and gravel, called the \"ancient alluvium\" by MM. Necker\r\nand Favre, corresponding to the \"older or lower diluvium\" of some\r\nwriters. Their origin is evidently due to the action of rivers, swollen\r\nby the melting of ice, by which the materials of parts of the old\r\nmoraines were rearranged and stratified and left usually at considerable\r\nheights above the level of the present valley plains.\r\n\r\nThird. The glaciers again advanced and became of gigantic dimensions,\r\nthough they fell far short of those of the first period. That of the\r\nRhone, for example, did not again reach the Jura, though it filled the\r\nLake of Geneva and formed enormous moraines on its borders and in many\r\nparts of the valley between the Alps and Jura.\r\n\r\nFourth. A second retreat of the glaciers took place when they gradually\r\nshrank nearly into their present limits, accompanied by another\r\naccumulation of stratified gravels which form in many places a series of\r\nterraces above the level of the alluvial plains of the existing rivers.\r\n\r\nIn the gorge of the Dranse, near Thonon, M. Morlot discovered no less\r\nthan three of these glacial formations in direct superposition, namely,\r\nat the bottom of the section, a mass of compact till or boulder-clay\r\n(Number 1) 12 feet thick, including striated boulders of Alpine\r\nlimestone, and covered by regularly stratified ancient alluvium (Number\r\n2) 150 feet thick, made up of rounded pebbles in horizontal beds.\r\nThis mass is in its turn overlaid by a second formation (Number 3) of\r\nunstratified boulder clay, with erratic blocks and striated pebbles,\r\nwhich constituted the left lateral moraine of the great glacier of the\r\nRhone when it advanced for the second time to the Lake of Geneva. At a\r\nshort distance from the above section terraces (Number 4) composed of\r\nstratified alluvium are seen at the heights of 20, 50, 100, and 150 feet\r\nabove the Lake of Geneva, which by their position can be shown to be\r\nposterior in date to the upper boulder-clay and therefore belong to the\r\nfourth period, or that of the last retreat of the great glaciers. In\r\nthe deposits of this fourth period the remains of the mammoth have\r\nbeen discovered, as at Morges, for example, on the Lake of Geneva. The\r\nconical delta of the Tiniere, mentioned in Chapter 2 as containing at\r\ndifferent depths monuments of the Roman as well as of the antecedent\r\nbronze and stone ages, is the work of alluvial deposition going on when\r\nthe terrace of 50 feet was in progress. This modern delta is supposed\r\nby M. Morlot to have required 10,000 years for its accumulation. At the\r\nheight of 150 feet above the lake, following up the course of the same\r\ntorrent, we come to a more ancient delta, about ten times as large,\r\nwhich is therefore supposed to be the monument of about ten times as\r\nmany centuries, or 100,000 years, all referable to the fourth period\r\nmentioned in the preceding page, or that which followed the last retreat\r\nof the great glaciers.*\r\n\r\n     (* Morlot, Terrain quaternaire du Bassin de Leman \"Bulletin\r\n     de la Societe Vaudoise des Sciences Naturelles\" Number 44.)\r\n\r\nIf the lower flattened cone of Tiniere be referred in great part to\r\nthe age of the oldest lake-dwellings, the higher one might perhaps\r\ncorrespond with the Pleistocene period of St. Acheul, or the era when\r\nMan and the Elephas primigenius flourished together; but no human\r\nremains or works of art have as yet been found in deposits of this\r\nage or in any alluvium containing the bones of extinct mammalia in\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, it is impossible not to be struck with an apparent\r\ncorrespondence in the succession of events of the glacial period of\r\nSwitzerland and that of the British Isles before described. The time\r\nof the first Alpine glaciers of colossal dimensions, when that chain\r\nperhaps was several thousand feet higher than now, may have agreed with\r\nthe first continental period when Scotland was invested with a universal\r\ncrust of ice. The retreat of the first Alpine glaciers, caused partly by\r\na lowering of that chain, may have been synchronous with the period of\r\ngreat submergence and floating ice in England. The second advance of the\r\nglaciers may have coincided in date with the re-elevation of the Alps,\r\nas well as of the Scotch and Welsh mountains; and lastly, the final\r\nretreat of the Swiss and Italian glaciers may have taken place when Man\r\nand the extinct mammalia were colonising the north-west of Europe and\r\nbeginning to inhabit areas which had formed the bed of the glacial sea\r\nduring the era of chief submergence.\r\n\r\nBut it must be confessed that in the present state of our knowledge\r\nthese attempts to compare the chronological relations of the periods\r\nof upheaval and subsidence of areas so widely separated as are the\r\nmountains of Scandinavia, the British Isles, and the Alps, or the times\r\nof the advance and retreat of glaciers in those several regions and\r\nthe greater or less intensity of cold, must be looked upon as very\r\nconjectural.\r\n\r\nWe may presume with more confidence that when the Alps were highest\r\nand the Alpine glaciers most developed, filling all the great lakes of\r\nnorthern Italy and loading the plains of Piedmont and Lombardy with\r\nice, the waters of the Mediterranean were chilled and of a lower average\r\ntemperature than now. Such a period of refrigeration is required by the\r\nconchologist to account for the prevalence of northern shells in the\r\nSicilian seas about the close of the Pliocene or commencement of the\r\nPleistocene period. For such shells as Cyprina islandica, Panopoea\r\nnorvegica (= P. bivonae, Philippi), Leda pygmaea, Munst, and some\r\nothers, enumerated among the fossils of the latest Tertiary formations\r\nof Sicily by Philippi and Edward Forbes, point unequivocally to a former\r\nmore severe climate. Dr. Hooker also in his late journey to Syria (in\r\nthe autumn of 1860) found the moraines of extinct glaciers, on which the\r\nwhole of the ancient cedars of Lebanon grow, to descend 4000 feet below\r\nthe summit of that chain. The temperature of Syria is now so much milder\r\nthat there is no longer perpetual snow even on the summit of Lebanon,\r\nthe height of which was ascertained to be 10,200 feet above the\r\nMediterranean.*\r\n\r\n     (* Hooker, \"Natural History Review\" Number 5 January 1862\r\n     page 11.)\r\n\r\nSuch monuments of a cold climate in latitudes so far south as Syria and\r\nthe north of Sicily, between 33 and 38 degrees north, may be confidently\r\nreferred to an early part of the glacial period, or to times long\r\nanterior to those of Man and the extinct mammalia of Abbeville and\r\nAmiens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16. -- HUMAN REMAINS IN THE LOESS, AND THEIR PROBABLE AGE.\r\n\r\n  Nature, Origin, and Age of the Loess of the Rhine and Danube.\r\n  Impalpable Mud produced by the Grinding Action of Glaciers.\r\n  Dispersion of this Mud at the Period of the Retreat of the\r\n     great Alpine Glaciers.\r\n  Continuity of the Loess from Switzerland to the Low Countries.\r\n  Characteristic Organic Remains not Lacustrine.\r\n  Alpine Gravel in the Valley of the Rhine covered by Loess.\r\n  Geographical Distribution of the Loess and its Height above the Sea.\r\n  Fossil Mammalia.\r\n  Loess of the Danube.\r\n  Oscillations in the Level of the Alps and lower Country required to\r\n     explain the Formation and Denudation of the Loess.\r\n  More rapid Movement of the Inland Country.\r\n  The same Depression and Upheaval might account for the Advance\r\n     and Retreat of the Alpine Glaciers.\r\n  Himalayan Mud of the Plains of the Ganges compared to\r\n     European Loess.\r\n  Human Remains in Loess near Maestricht, and their probable\r\n     Antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE LOESS.\r\n\r\nIntimately connected with the subjects treated of in the last chapter,\r\nis the nature, origin, and age of certain loamy deposits, commonly\r\ncalled loess, which form a marked feature in the superficial deposits\r\nof the basins of the Rhine, Danube, and some other large rivers draining\r\nthe Alps, and which extend down the Rhine into the Low Countries, and\r\nwere once perhaps continuous with others of like composition in the\r\nnorth of France. [35]\r\n\r\nIt has been reported of late years that human remains have been detected\r\nat several points in the loess of the Meuse around and below Maestricht.\r\nI have visited the localities referred to; but, before giving an account\r\nof them, it will be desirable to explain what is meant by the loess, a\r\nstep the more necessary as a French geologist for whose knowledge and\r\njudgment I have great respect, tells me he has come to the conclusion\r\nthat \"the loess\" is \"a myth,\" having no real existence in a geological\r\nsense or as holding a definite place in the chronological series.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is true that in every country, and at all geological\r\nperiods, rivers have been depositing fine loam on their inundated plains\r\nin the manner explained above in Chapter 3, where the Nile mud was\r\nspoken of. This mud of the plains of Egypt, according to Professor\r\nBischoff's chemical analysis agrees closely in composition with the\r\nloess of the Rhine.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Chemical and Physical Geology\" volume 1 page 132.)\r\n\r\nI have also shown when speaking of the fossil man of Natchez, how\r\nidentical in mineral character and in the genera of its terrestrial and\r\namphibious shells is the ancient fluviatile loam of the Mississippi\r\nwith the loess of the Rhine. But granting that loam presenting the same\r\naspect has originated at different times and in distinct hydrographical\r\nbasins, it is nevertheless true that during the glacial period the Alps\r\nwere a great centre of dispersion, not only of erratics, as we have seen\r\nin the last chapter, and of gravel which was carried farther than the\r\nerratics, but also of very fine mud which was transported to still\r\ngreater distances and in greater volume down the principal river-courses\r\nbetween the mountains and the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUD PRODUCED BY GLACIERS.\r\n\r\nThey who have visited Switzerland are aware that every torrent which\r\nissues from an icy cavern at the extremity of a glacier is densely\r\ncharged with an impalpable powder, produced by the grinding action to\r\nwhich the subjacent floor of rock and the stones and sand frozen into\r\nthe ice are exposed in the manner before described. We may therefore\r\nreadily conceive that a much greater volume of fine sediment was swept\r\nalong by rivers swollen by melting ice at the time of the retreat of the\r\ngigantic glaciers of the olden time. The fact that a large proportion\r\nof this mud, instead of being carried to the ocean where it might have\r\nformed a delta on the coast or have been dispersed far and wide by the\r\ntides and currents, has accumulated in inland valleys, will be found\r\nto be an additional proof of the former occurrence of those grand\r\noscillations in the level of the Alps and parts of the adjoining\r\ncontinent which were required to explain the alternate advance and\r\nretreat of the glaciers, and the superposition of more than one boulder\r\nclay and stratified alluvium.\r\n\r\nThe position of the loess between Basle and Bonn is such as to imply\r\nthat the great valley of the Rhine had already acquired its present\r\nshape, and in some places, perhaps more than its actual depth and width,\r\npreviously to the time when it was gradually filled up to a great extent\r\nwith fine loam. The greater part of this loam has been since removed,\r\nso that a fringe only of the deposit is now left on the flanks of the\r\nboundary hills, or occasionally some outliers in the middle of the great\r\nplain of the Rhine where it expands in width.\r\n\r\nThese outliers are sometimes on such a scale as to admit of minor hills\r\nand valleys, having been shaped out of them by the action of rain and\r\nsmall streamlets, as near Freiburg in the Breisgau and other districts.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL SHELLS OF THE LOESS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figures 44, 45, and 46]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 44. Succinea oblonga.)\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 45. Pupa muscorum.)\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 46. Helix hispida, Lin.; H. plebeia, Drap.)\r\n\r\nThe loess is generally devoid of fossils, although in many places they\r\nare abundant, consisting of land-shells, all of living species, and\r\ncomprising no small part of the entire molluscous fauna now inhabiting\r\nthe same region. The three shells most frequently met with are those\r\nrepresented in the annexed figures (44, 45 and 46). The slug, called\r\nSuccinea, is not strictly aquatic, but lives in damp places, and may be\r\nseen in full activity far from rivers, in meadows where the grass is wet\r\nwith rain or dew; but shells of the genera Limnaea, Planorbis, Paludina,\r\nCyclas, and others, requiring to be constantly in the water, are\r\nextremely exceptional in the loess, occurring only at the bottom of the\r\ndeposit where it begins to alternate with ancient river-gravel on which\r\nit usually reposes.\r\n\r\nThis underlying gravel consists in the valley of the Rhine for the most\r\npart of pebbles and boulders of Alpine origin, showing that there was a\r\ntime when the rivers had power to convey coarse materials for hundreds\r\nof miles northwards from Switzerland towards the sea; whereas at a later\r\nperiod an entire change was brought about in the physical geography of\r\nthe same district, so that the same river deposited nothing but fine\r\nmud, which accumulated to a thickness of 800 feet or more above the\r\noriginal alluvial plain.\r\n\r\nBut although most of the fundamental gravel was derived from the Alps,\r\nthere has been observed in the neighbourhood of the principal mountain\r\nchains bordering the great valley, such as the Black Forest, Vosges,\r\nand Odenwald, an admixture of detritus characteristic of those several\r\nchains. We cannot doubt therefore that as some of these mountains,\r\nespecially the Vosges, had during the glacial period their own glaciers,\r\na part of the fine mud of their moraines must have been mingled with\r\nloess of Alpine origin; although the principal mass of the latter must\r\nhave come from Switzerland, and can in fact be traced continuously from\r\nBasle to Belgium.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE LOESS.\r\n\r\nIt was stated in the last chapter that at the time of the greatest\r\nextension of the Swiss glaciers the Lake of Constance and all the other\r\ngreat lakes were filled with ice, so that gravel and mud could pass\r\nfreely from the upper Alpine valley of the Rhine to the lower region\r\nbetween Basle and the sea, the great lake intercepting no part of the\r\nmoraines whether fine or coarse. On the other hand the Aar with its\r\ngreat tributaries the Limmat and the Reuss does not join the Rhine till\r\nafter it issues from the Lake of Constance; and by their channels a\r\nlarge part of the Alpine gravel and mud could always have passed without\r\nobstruction into the lower country, even after the ice of the great lake\r\nhad melted.\r\n\r\nIt will give the reader some idea of the manner in which the Rhenish\r\nloess occurs, if he is told that some of the earlier scientific\r\nobservers imagined it to have been formed in a vast lake which occupied\r\nthe valley of the Rhine from Basle to Mayence, sending up arms or\r\nbranches into what are now the valleys of the Main, Neckar, and other\r\nlarge rivers. They placed the barrier of this imaginary lake in the\r\nnarrow and picturesque gorge of the Rhine between Bingen and Coblenz:\r\nand when it was objected that the lateral valley of the Lahn,\r\ncommunicating with that gorge, had also been filled with loess, they\r\nwere compelled to transfer the great dam farther down and to place it\r\nbelow Bonn. Strictly speaking it must be placed much farther north, or\r\nin the 51st parallel of latitude, where the limits of the loess have\r\nbeen traced out by MM. Omalius D'Halloy, Dumont, and others, running\r\neast and west by Cologne, Juliers, Louvain, Oudenarde, and Courtrai in\r\nBelgium to Cassel, near Dunkirk in France. This boundary line may not\r\nindicate the original seaward extent of the formation, as it may have\r\nstretched still farther north and its present abrupt termination may\r\nonly show how far it was cut back at some former period by the denuding\r\naction of the sea.\r\n\r\nEven if the imbedded fossil shells of the loess had been lacustrine,\r\ninstead of being, as we have seen, terrestrial and amphibious, the vast\r\nheight and width of the required barrier would have been fatal to\r\nthe theory of a lake: for the loess is met with in great force at\r\nan elevation of no less than 1600 feet above the sea, covering the\r\nKaiserstuhl, a volcanic mountain which stands in the middle of the great\r\nvalley of the Rhine, near Freiburg in Breisgau. The extent to which the\r\nvalley has there been the receptacle of fine mud afterwards removed is\r\nmost remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe loess of Belgium was called \"Hesbayan mud\" in the geological map of\r\nthe late M. Dumont, who, I am told, recognised it as being in great\r\npart composed of Alpine mud. M. d'Archiac, when speaking of the loess,\r\nobserves that it envelopes Hainault, Brabant, and Limburg like a mantle\r\neverywhere uniform and homogeneous in character, filling up the lower\r\ndepressions of the Ardennes and passing thence into the north of France,\r\nthough not crossing into England. In France, he adds, it is found on\r\nhigh plateaus 600 feet above some of the rivers, such as the Marne;\r\nbut as we go southwards and eastwards of the basin of the Seine, it\r\ndiminishes in quantity, and finally thins out in those directions.*\r\n\r\n     (* D'Archiac, \"Histoire des Progres\" volume 2 pages 169,\r\n     170.)\r\n\r\nIt may even be a question whether the \"limon des plateaux,\" or upland\r\nloam of the Somme valley, before alluded to,* may not be a part of the\r\nsame formation.\r\n\r\n     (* Number 4 Figure 7.)\r\n\r\nAs to the higher and lower level gravels of that valley, which, like\r\nthat of the Seine, contain no foreign rocks, we have seen that they are\r\neach of them covered by deposits of loess or inundation-mud belonging\r\nrespectively to the periods of the gravels, whereas the upland loam is\r\nof much older date, more widely spread, and occupying positions often\r\nindependent of the present lines of drainage. To restore in imagination\r\nthe geographical outline of Picardy, to which rivers charged with so\r\nmuch homogeneous loam and running at such heights may once have belonged\r\nis now impossible.*\r\n\r\n     (* See above, Chapter 8. )\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Rhine, as I before observed, the body of the loess,\r\ninstead of having been formed at successively lower and lower levels as\r\nin the case of the basin of the Somme, was deposited in a wide and deep\r\npre-existing basin, or strath, bounded by lofty mountain chains such\r\nas the Black Forest, Vosges, and Odenwald. In some places the loam\r\naccumulated to such a depth as first to fill the valley and then to\r\nspread over the adjoining table-lands, as in the case of the Lower\r\nEifel, where it encircled some of the modern volcanic cones of loose\r\npumice and ashes. In these instances it does not appear to me that the\r\nvolcanoes were in eruption during the time of the deposition of the\r\nloess, as some geologists have supposed. The interstratification of loam\r\nand volcanic ejectamenta was probably occasioned by the fluviatile mud\r\nhaving gradually enveloped the cones of loose scoriae after they were\r\ncompletely formed. I am the more inclined to embrace this view after\r\nhaving seen the junction of granite and loess on the steep slopes of\r\nsome of the mountains bounding the great plain of the Rhine on its\r\nright bank in the Bergstrasse. Thus between Darmstadt and Heidelberg\r\nperpendicular sections are seen of loess 200 feet thick, at various\r\nheights above the river, some of them at elevations of 800 feet and\r\nupwards. In one of these may be seen, resting on the hill side of\r\nMelibocus in the Odenwald, the usual yellow loam free from pebbles at\r\nits contact with a steep slope of granite, but divided into horizontal\r\nlayers for a short distance from the line of junction. In these layers,\r\nwhich abut against the granite, a mixture of mica and of unrounded\r\ngrains of quartz and felspar occur, evidently derived from the\r\ndisintegration of the crystalline rock, which must have decomposed in\r\nthe atmosphere before the mud had reached this height. Entire shells of\r\nHelix, Pupa, and Succinea, of the usual living species, are embedded in\r\nthe granitic mixture. We may therefore be sure that the valley bounded\r\nby steep hills of granite existed before the tranquil accumulation of\r\nthis vast body of loess.\r\n\r\nDuring the re-excavation of the basin of the Rhine successive deposits\r\nof loess of newer origin were formed at various heights; and it is often\r\ndifficult to distinguish their relative ages, especially as fossils are\r\noften entirely wanting, and the mineral composition of the formation is\r\nso uniform.\r\n\r\nThe loess in Belgium is variable in thickness, usually ranging from\r\n10 to 30 feet. It caps some of the highest hills or table-land around\r\nBrussels at the height of 300 feet above the sea. In such places it\r\nusually rests on gravel and rarely contains shells, but when they\r\noccur they are of Recent species. I found the Succinea oblonga, before\r\nmentioned, and Helix hispida in the Belgian loess at Neerepen, between\r\nTongres and Hasselt, where M. Bosquet had previously obtained remains\r\nof an elephant referred to E. primigenius. This pachyderm and Rhinoceros\r\ntichorhinus are cited as characterising the loess in various parts of\r\nthe valley of the Rhine. Several perfect skeletons of the marmot have\r\nbeen disinterred from the loess of Aix-la-Chapelle. But much remains to\r\nbe done in determining the species of mammalia of this formation and the\r\nrelative altitudes above the valley-plain at which they occur.\r\n\r\nIf we ascend the basin of the Neckar, we find that it is filled with\r\nloess of great thickness, far above its junction with the Rhine. At\r\nCanstadt near Stuttgart, loess resembling that of the Rhine contains\r\nmany fossil bones, especially those of Elephas primigenius, together\r\nwith some of Rhinoceros tichorhinus, the species having been lately\r\ndetermined by Dr. Falconer. At this place the loess is covered by a\r\nthick bed of travertine, used as a building stone, the product of a\r\nmineral spring. In the travertine are many fossil plants, all Recent\r\nexcept two, an oak and poplar, the leaves of which Professor Heer has\r\nnot been able to identify with any known species.\r\n\r\nBelow the loess of Canstadt, in which bones of the mammoth are so\r\nabundant, is a bed of gravel evidently an old river channel now many\r\nfeet above the level of the Neckar, the valley having there been\r\nexcavated to some depth below its ancient channel so as to lie in the\r\nunderlying red sandstone of Keuper. Although the loess, when traced from\r\nthe valley of the Rhine into that of the Neckar, or into any other\r\nof its tributaries, often undergoes some slight alteration in its\r\ncharacter, yet there is so much identity of composition as to suggest\r\nthe idea that the mud of the main river passed far up the tributary\r\nvalleys, just as that of the Mississippi during floods flows far up the\r\nOhio, carrying its mud with it into the basin of that river. But\r\nthe uniformity of colour and mineral composition does not extend\r\nindefinitely into the higher parts of every basin. In that of the\r\nNeckar, for example, near Tubingen, I found the fluviatile loam or\r\nbrick-earth, enclosing the usual Helices and Succineae, together with\r\nthe bones of the mammoth, very distinct in colour and composition from\r\nordinary Rhenish loess, and such as no one could confound with Alpine\r\nmud. It is mottled with red and green, like the New Red Sandstone or\r\nKeuper, from which it has clearly been derived.\r\n\r\nSuch examples, however, merely show that where a basin is so limited\r\nin size that the detritus is derived chiefly or exclusively from one\r\nformation, the prevailing rock will impart its colour and composition\r\nin a very decided manner to the loam; whereas, in the basin of a great\r\nriver which has many tributaries, the loam will consist of a mixture\r\nof almost every variety of rock, and will therefore exhibit an average\r\nresult nearly the same in all countries. Thus, the loam which fills to\r\na great depth the wide valley of the Saone, which is bounded on the west\r\nside by an escarpment of Inferior Oolite, and by the chain of the Jura\r\non the east, is very like the loess found in the continuation of the\r\nsame great basin after the junction of the Rhone, by which a large\r\nsupply of Alpine mud has been added and intermixed.\r\n\r\nIn the higher parts of the basin of the Danube, loess of the same\r\ncharacter as that of the Rhine, and which I believe to be chiefly of\r\nAlpine origin, attains a far greater elevation above the sea than any\r\ndeposits of Rhenish loess; but the loam which, according to M. Stur,\r\nfills valleys on the north slope of the Carpathians almost up to the\r\nwatershed between Galicia and Hungary, may be derived from a distinct\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSCILLATIONS OF LEVEL REQUIRED TO EXPLAIN THE ACCUMULATION AND\r\nDENUDATION OF THE LOESS.\r\n\r\nA theory, therefore, which attempts to account for the position of the\r\nloess cannot be satisfactory unless it be equally applicable to the\r\nbasins of the Rhine and Danube. So far as relates to the source of so\r\nmuch homogeneous loam, there are many large tributaries of the Danube\r\nwhich, during the glacial period, may have carried an ample supply\r\nof moraine-mud from the Alps to that river; and in regard to grand\r\noscillations in the level of the land, it is obvious that the same\r\nmovements both downward and upward of the great mountain-chain would\r\nbe attended with analogous effects, whether the great rivers flowed\r\nnorthwards or eastwards. In each case fine loam would be accumulated\r\nduring subsidence and removed during the upheaval of the land. Changes,\r\ntherefore, of level analogous to those on which we have been led to\r\nspeculate when endeavouring to solve the various problems presented by\r\nthe glacial phenomena, are equally available to account for the nature\r\nand geological distribution of the loess. But we must suppose that\r\nthe amount of depression and re-elevation in the central region was\r\nconsiderably in excess of that experienced in the lower countries, or\r\nthose nearer the sea, and that the rate of subsidence in the latter was\r\nnever so considerable as to cause submergence, or the admission of the\r\nsea into the interior of the continent by the valleys of the principal\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nWe have already assumed that the Alps were loftier than now, when they\r\nwere the source of those gigantic glaciers which reached the flanks of\r\nthe Jura. At that time gravel was borne to the greatest distances from\r\nthe central mountains through the main valleys, which had a somewhat\r\nsteeper slope than now, and the quantity of river-ice must at that time\r\nhave aided in the transportation of pebbles and boulders. To this state\r\nof things gradually succeeded another of an opposite character, when the\r\nfall of the rivers from the mountains to the sea became less and less,\r\nwhile the Alps were slowly sinking, and the first retreat of the great\r\nglaciers was taking place. Suppose the depression to have been at the\r\nrate of 5 feet in a century in the mountains and only as many inches in\r\nthe same time nearer the coast, still, in such areas as the eye could\r\nsurvey at once, comprising a small part only of Switzerland or of the\r\nbasin of the Rhine, the movement might appear to be uniform and the\r\npre-existing valleys and heights might seem to remain relatively to each\r\nother as before.\r\n\r\nSuch inequality in the rate of rising or sinking, when we contemplate\r\nlarge continental spaces, is quite consistent with what we know of\r\nthe course of nature in our own times as well as at remote geological\r\nepochs. Thus in Sweden, as before stated, the rise of land now in\r\nprogress is nearly uniform as we proceed from north to south for\r\nmoderate distances; but it greatly diminishes southwards if we compare\r\nareas hundreds of miles apart; so that instead of the land rising about\r\n5 feet in a hundred years as at the North Cape, it becomes less than\r\nthe same number of inches at Stockholm, and farther south the land is\r\nstationary, or, if not, seems rather to be descending than ascending.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles of Geology\" chapter 30 9th edition page 519\r\n     et seq.)\r\n\r\nTo cite an example of high geological antiquity, M. Hebert has\r\ndemonstrated that, during the Oolitic and Cretaceous periods, similar\r\ninequalities in the vertical movements of the earth's crust took place\r\nin Switzerland and France. By his own observations and those of M. Lory\r\nhe has proved that the area of the Alps was rising and emerging from\r\nbeneath the ocean towards the close of the Oolitic epoch, and was above\r\nwater at the commencement of the Cretaceous era; while, on the other\r\nhand, the area of the Jura, about 100 miles to the north, was slowly\r\nsinking at the close of the Oolitic period, and had become submerged at\r\nthe commencement of the Cretaceous. Yet these oscillations of level were\r\naccomplished without any perceptible derangement in the strata, which\r\nremained all the while horizontal, so that the Lower Cretaceous or\r\nNeocomian beds were deposited conformably on the Oolitic.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Bulletin de la Societe Geologique de France\" 2 series\r\n     volume 16 1859 page 596.)\r\n\r\nTaking for granted then that the depression was more rapid in the more\r\nelevated region, the great rivers would lose century after century some\r\nportion of their velocity or carrying power, and would leave behind them\r\non their alluvial plains more and more of the moraine-mud with which\r\nthey were charged, till at length, in the course of thousands or some\r\ntens of thousands of years, a large part of the main valleys would\r\nbegin to resemble the plains of Egypt where nothing but mud is deposited\r\nduring the flood season. The thickness of loam containing shells of land\r\nand amphibious mollusca might in this way accumulate to any extent, so\r\nthat the waters might overflow some of the heights originally bounding\r\nthe valley and deposits of \"platform mud,\" as it has been termed in\r\nFrance, might be extensively formed. At length, whenever a re-elevation\r\nof the Alps at the time of the second extension of the glaciers took\r\nplace, there would be renewed denudation and removal of such loess; and\r\nif, as some geologists believe, there has been more than one oscillation\r\nof level in the Alps since the commencement of the glacial period, the\r\nchanges would be proportionally more complicated and terraces of gravel\r\ncovered with loess might be formed at different heights and at different\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIMALAYAN MUD OF THE GANGES COMPARED TO EUROPEAN LOESS.\r\n\r\nSome of the revolutions in physical geography above suggested for the\r\ncontinent of Europe during the Pleistocene epoch, may have had their\r\ncounterparts in India in the Recent Period. The vast plains of Bengal\r\nare overspread with Himalayan mud, which as we ascend the Ganges extends\r\ninland for 1200 miles from the sea, continuing very homogeneous on the\r\nwhole, though becoming more sandy as it nears the hills. They who sail\r\ndown the river during a season of inundation see nothing but a sheet of\r\nwater in every direction, except here and there where the tops of trees\r\nemerge above its level. To what depth the mud extends is not known, but\r\nit resembles the loess in being generally devoid of stratification, and\r\nof shells, though containing occasionally land shells in abundance, as\r\nwell as calcareous concretions, called kunkur, which may be compared to\r\nthe nodules of carbonate of lime sometimes observed to form layers in\r\nthe Rhenish loess. I am told by Colonel Strachey and Dr. Hooker that\r\nabove Calcutta, in the Hooghly, when the flood subsides, the Gangetic\r\nmud may be seen in river cliffs 80 feet high, in which they were unable\r\nto detect organic remains, a remark which I found to hold equally in\r\nregard to the Recent mud of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nDr. Wallich, while confirming these observations, informs me that at\r\ncertain points in Bengal, farther inland, he met with land-shells in the\r\nbanks of the great river. Borings have been made at Calcutta, beginning\r\nnot many feet above the sea-level, to the depth of 300 and 400 feet; and\r\nwherever organic remains were found in the strata pierced through they\r\nwere of a fluviatile or terrestrial character, implying that during a\r\nlong and gradual subsidence of the country the sediment thrown down\r\nby the Ganges and Brahmaputra had accumulated at a sufficient rate to\r\nprevent the sea from invading that region.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the borings, after passing through much fine loam, beds\r\nof pebbles, sand, and boulders were reached, such as might belong to an\r\nancient river channel; and the bones of a crocodile and the shell of\r\na freshwater tortoise were met with at the depth of 400 feet from the\r\nsurface. No pebbles are now brought down within a great distance of\r\nthis point, so that the country must once have had a totally different\r\ncharacter and may have had its valleys, hills, and rivers, before all\r\nwas reduced to one common level by the accumulation upon it of fine\r\nHimalayan mud. If the latter were removed during a gradual re-elevation\r\nof the country, many old hydrographical basins might reappear, and\r\nportions of the loam might alone remain in terraces on the flanks of\r\nhills, or on platforms, attesting the vast extent in ancient times\r\nof the muddy envelope. A similar succession of events has, in all\r\nlikelihood, occurred in Europe during the deposition and denudation of\r\nthe loess of the Pleistocene period, which, as we have seen in a former\r\nchapter, was long enough to allow of the gradual development of almost\r\nany amount of such physical changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMAN REMAINS IN THE LOESS NEAR STRASBURG.\r\n\r\nM. Ami Boue, well known by his numerous works on geology and a\r\nwell-practised observer in every branch of the science, disinterred in\r\nthe year 1823 with his own hands many bones of a human skeleton from\r\nancient undisturbed loess at Lahr, nearly opposite Strasburg, on the\r\nright side of the great valley of the Rhine. No skull was detected, but\r\nthe tibia, fibula, and several other bones were obtained in a good state\r\nof preservation and shown at the time to Cuvier, who pronounced them to\r\nbe human.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMAN REMAINS IN LOESS NEAR MAESTRICHT.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Meuse at Maestricht, like those of the Rhine at Bonn\r\nand Cologne, are slightly elevated above the level of the alluvial\r\nplain. On the right bank of the Meuse, opposite Maestricht, the\r\ndifference of level is so marked that a bridge with many arches has been\r\nconstructed to keep up, during the flood season, a communication between\r\nthe higher parts of the alluvial plain and the hills or bluffs which\r\nbound it. This plain is composed of modern loess, undistinguishable in\r\nmineral character from that of higher antiquity, before alluded to,\r\nand entirely without signs of successive deposition and devoid\r\nof terrestrial or fluviatile shells. It is extensively worked for\r\nbrick-earth to the depth of about 8 feet. The bluffs before alluded to\r\noften consist of a terrace of gravel, from 30 to 40 feet in thickness,\r\ncovered by an older loess, which is continuous as we ascend the valley\r\nto Liege. In the suburbs of that city patches of loess are seen at the\r\nheight of 200 feet above the level of the Meuse. The table-land in that\r\nregion, composed of Carboniferous and Devonian rocks, is about 450 feet\r\nhigh, and is not overspread with loess.\r\n\r\nA terrace of gravel covered with loess has been mentioned as existing\r\non the right bank of the Meuse at Maestricht. Answering to it another\r\nis also seen on the left bank below that city, and a promontory of\r\nit projecting into the alluvial plain of the Meuse and approaching\r\nto within a hundred yards of the river, was cut through during the\r\nexcavation of a canal running from Maestricht to Hocht, between the\r\nyears 1815 and 1823. This section occurs at the village of Smeermass,\r\nand is about 60 feet deep, the lower 40 feet consisting of stratified\r\ngravel and the upper of 20 feet of loess. The number of molars, tusks,\r\nand bones (probably parts of entire skeletons) of elephants obtained\r\nduring these diggings, was extraordinary. Not a few of them are still\r\npreserved in the museums of Maestricht and Leyden, together with some\r\nhorns of deer, bones of the ox-tribe and other mammalia, and a human\r\nlower jaw, with teeth. According to Professor Crahay, who published an\r\naccount of it at the time, this jaw, which is now preserved at Leyden,\r\nwas found at the depth of 19 feet from the surface, where the loess\r\njoins the underlying gravel, in a stratum of sandy loam resting on\r\ngravel and overlaid by some pebbly and sandy beds. The stratum is said\r\nto have been intact and undisturbed, but the human jaw was isolated,\r\nthe nearest tusk of an elephant being six yards removed from it in\r\nhorizontal distance.\r\n\r\nMost of the other mammalian bones were found; like these human remains,\r\nin or near the gravel, but some of the tusks and teeth of elephants were\r\nmet with much nearer the surface. I visited the site of these fossils in\r\n1860 in company with M. van Binkhorst, and we found the description of\r\nthe ground, published by the late Professor Crahay of Louvain, to be\r\nvery correct.*\r\n\r\n     (* M. van Binkhorst has shown me the original manuscript\r\n     read to the Maestricht Athenaeum in 1823. The memoir was\r\n     published in 1836 in the \"Bulletin de l'Academie Royale de\r\n     Belgique\" volume 3 page 43.)\r\n\r\nThe projecting portion of the terrace, which was cut through in making\r\nthe canal, is called the hill of Caberg, which is flat-topped, 60 feet\r\nhigh, and has a steep slope on both sides towards the alluvial plain.\r\nM. van Binkhorst (who is the author of some valuable works on the\r\npalaeontology of the Maestricht Chalk) has recently visited Leyden, and\r\nascertained that the human fossil above mentioned is still entire in the\r\nmuseum of the University. Although we had no opportunity of verifying\r\nthe authenticity of Professor Crahay's statements, we could see no\r\nreason for suspecting the human jaw to belong to a different geological\r\nperiod from that of the extinct elephant. If this were granted, it might\r\nhave no claims to a higher antiquity than the human remains which Dr.\r\nSchmerling disentombed from the Belgian caverns; but the fact of their\r\noccurring in a Pleistocene alluvial deposit in the open plains, would be\r\none of the first examples of such a phenomenon. The top of the hill of\r\nCaberg is not so high above the Meuse as is the terrace of St. Acheul\r\nwith its flint implements above the Somme, but at St. Acheul no human\r\nbones have yet been detected.\r\n\r\nIn the museum at Maestricht are preserved a human frontal and a pelvic\r\nbone, stained of a dark peaty colour; the frontal very remarkable\r\nfor its lowness and the prominence of the superciliary ridges, which\r\nresemble those of the Borreby skull, Figure 5. These remains may be the\r\nsame as those alluded to by Professor Crahay in his memoir, where he\r\nsays that in a black deposit in the suburbs of Hocht were found leaves,\r\nnuts, and freshwater shells in a very perfect state, and a human skull\r\nof a dark colour. They were of an age long posterior to that of the\r\nloess containing the bones of elephants and in which the human jaw now\r\nat Leyden is said to have been embedded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17. -- POST-GLACIAL DISLOCATIONS AND FOLDINGS OF CRETACEOUS AND\r\nDRIFT STRATA IN THE ISLAND OF MOEN, IN DENMARK.\r\n\r\n  Geological Structure of the Island of Moen.\r\n  Great Disturbances of the Chalk posterior in Date to the\r\n     Glacial Drift, with Recent Shells.\r\n  M. Puggaard's Sections of the Cliffs of Moen.\r\n  Flexures and Faults common to the Chalk and Glacial Drift.\r\n  Different Direction of the Lines of successive Movement,\r\n     Fracture, and Flexure.\r\n  Undisturbed Condition of the Rocks in the adjoining Danish Islands.\r\n  Unequal Movements of Upheaval in Finmark.\r\n  Earthquake of New Zealand in 1855.\r\n  Predominance in all Ages of uniform Continental Movements over\r\n     those by which the Rocks are locally convulsed.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters I have endeavoured to show that the study of\r\nthe successive phases of the glacial period in Europe, and the enduring\r\nmarks which they have left on many of the solid rocks and on the\r\ncharacter of the superficial drift are of great assistance in enabling\r\nus to appreciate the vast lapse of ages which are comprised in the\r\nPleistocene epoch. They enlarge at the same time our conception of the\r\nantiquity, not only of the living species of animals and plants but\r\nof their present geographical distribution, and throw light on the\r\nchronological relations of these species to the earliest date yet\r\nascertained for the existence of the human race. That date, it will be\r\nseen, is very remote if compared to the times of history and tradition,\r\nyet very modern if contrasted with the length of time during which all\r\nthe living testacea, and even many of the mammalia, have inhabited the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nIn order to render my account of the phenomena of the glacial epoch\r\nmore complete, I shall describe in this chapter some other changes in\r\nphysical geography and in the internal structure of the earth's crust,\r\nwhich have happened in the Pleistocene period, because they differ\r\nin kind from any previously alluded to, and are of a class which were\r\nthought by the earlier geologists to belong exclusively to epochs\r\nanterior to the origin of the existing fauna and flora. Of this nature\r\nare those faults and violent local dislocations of the rocks, and those\r\nsharp bendings and foldings of the strata, which we so often behold in\r\nmountain chains, and sometimes in low countries also, especially where\r\nthe rock-formations are of ancient date.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-GLACIAL DISLOCATIONS AND FOLDINGS OF CRETACEOUS AND DRIFT STRATA IN\r\nTHE ISLAND OF MOEN, DENMARK.\r\n\r\nA striking illustration of such convulsions of Pleistocene date may\r\nbe seen in the Danish island of Moen, which is situated about 50 miles\r\nsouth of Copenhagen. The island is about 60 miles in circumference, and\r\nconsists of white Chalk, several hundred feet thick, overlaid by\r\nboulder clay and sand, or glacial drift which is made up of several\r\nsubdivisions, some unstratified and others stratified, the whole having\r\na mean thickness of 60 feet, but sometimes attaining nearly twice that\r\nthickness. In one of the oldest members of the formation fossil marine\r\nshells of existing species have been found.\r\n\r\nThroughout the greater part of Moen the strata of the drift are\r\nundisturbed and horizontal, as are those of the subjacent Chalk; but on\r\nthe north-eastern coast they have been throughout a certain area bent,\r\nfolded, and shifted, together with the beds of the underlying Cretaceous\r\nformation. Within this area they have been even more deranged than is\r\nthe English Chalk-with-flints along the central axis of the Isle of\r\nWight in Hampshire, or of Purbeck in Dorsetshire. The whole displacement\r\nof the Chalk is evidently posterior in date to the origin of the drift,\r\nsince the beds of the latter are horizontal where the fundamental\r\nChalk is horizontal, and inclined, curved, or vertical where the Chalk\r\ndisplays signs of similar derangement. Although I had come to these\r\nconclusions respecting the structure of Moen in 1835, after devoting\r\nseveral days in company with Dr. Forchhammer to its examination,*\r\n\r\n     (* Lyell, \"Geological Transactions\" 2nd series volume 2 page\r\n     243.)\r\n\r\nI should have hesitated to cite the spot as exemplifying convulsions on\r\nso grand a scale, of such extremely modern date, had not the island been\r\nsince thoroughly investigated by a most able and reliable authority,\r\nthe Danish geologist, Professor Puggaard, who has published a series of\r\ndetailed sections of the cliffs.\r\n\r\nThese cliffs extend through the north-eastern coast of the island,\r\ncalled Moens Klint,* where the Chalk precipices are bold and\r\npicturesque, being 300 and 400 feet high, with tall beech-trees growing\r\non their summits, and covered here and there at their base with huge\r\ntaluses of fallen drift, verdant with wild shrubs and grass, by which\r\nthe monotony of a continuous range of white Chalk cliffs is prevented.\r\n\r\n     (* Puggaard, \"Geologie d. Insel Moen\" Bern 1851; and\r\n     \"Bulletin de la Societe Geologique de France\" 1851.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 47 and 48. Southern Extremity Of Moens Klint]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 47.

Fossil shells of recent species in the drift at this point.\r\n  G. Greatest height near G, 280 feet.)\r\n\r\nIn the low part of the island, at A, Figure 47, or the southern\r\nextremity of the line of section above alluded to, the drift is\r\nhorizontal, but when we reach B, a change, both in the height of the\r\ncliffs and in the inclination of the strata, begins to be perceptible,\r\nand the Chalk Number 1 soon makes its appearance from beneath the\r\noverlying members of the drift Numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5.\r\n\r\nThis Chalk, with its layers of flints, is so like that of England as to\r\nrequire no description. The incumbent drift consists of the following\r\nsubdivisions, beginning with the lowest:\r\n\r\nNumber 2. Stratified loam and sand, 5 feet thick, containing at one\r\nspot near the base of the cliff, at s, Figure 48, Cardium edule, Tellina\r\nsolidula, and Turritella, with fragments of other shells. Between Number\r\n2 and the Chalk Number 1, there usually intervenes a breccia of broken\r\nflints.\r\n\r\nNumber 3. Unstratified blue clay or till, with small pebbles and\r\nfragments of Scandinavian rocks occasionally scattered through it, 20\r\nfeet thick.\r\n\r\nNumber 4. A second unstratified mass of yellow and more sandy clay 40\r\nfeet thick, with pebbles and angular polished and striated blocks of\r\ngranite and other Scandinavian rocks, transported from a distance.\r\n\r\nNumber 5. Stratified sands and gravel, with occasionally large erratic\r\nblocks; the whole mass varying from 40 to 100 feet in thickness, but\r\nthis only in a few spots.\r\n\r\nThe angularity of many of the blocks in Numbers 3 and 4, the glaciated\r\nsurfaces of others, and the transportation from a distance attested by\r\ntheir crystalline nature, prove them to belong to the northern drift or\r\nglacial period.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the four subdivisions 2, 3, 4, and 5 begin to rise\r\nat B, Figure 47, and that at C, where the cliff is 180 feet high, there\r\nis a sharp flexure shared equally by the Chalk and the incumbent drift.\r\nBetween D and G, Figure 48, we observe a great fracture in the rocks\r\nwith synclinal and anticlinal folds, exhibited in cliffs nearly 300 feet\r\nhigh, the drift beds participating in all the bendings of the Chalk;\r\nthat is to say, the three lower members of the drift, including Number\r\n2, which, at the point S in this diagram, contains the shells of Recent\r\nspecies before alluded to.\r\n\r\nNear the northern end of the Moens Klint, at a place called \"Taler,\"\r\nmore than 300 feet high, are seen similar folds, so sharp that there\r\nis an appearance of four distinct alternations of the glacial and\r\nCretaceous formations in vertical or highly inclined beds; the Chalk at\r\none point bending over so that the position of all the beds is reversed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 49. Post-Glacial Disturbances]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 49.

Puggaard, along\r\nthe planes of contact of the shifted beds, the marks of polishing and\r\nrubbing which the Chalk flints have undergone, as have many stones in\r\nthe gravel of the drift, and some of these have also been forced into\r\nthe soft Chalk. The manner in which the top of some of the arches of\r\nbent Chalk have been cut off in this and several adjoining sections,\r\nattests the great denudation which accompanied the disturbances,\r\nportions of the bent strata having been removed, probably while they\r\nwere emerging from beneath the sea.\r\n\r\nM. Puggaard has deduced the following conclusions from his study of\r\nthese cliffs.\r\n\r\nFirst. The white Chalk, when it was still in horizontal stratification,\r\nbut after it had suffered considerable denudation, subsided gradually,\r\nso that the lower beds of drift Number 2, with their littoral shells,\r\nwere superimposed on the Chalk in a shallow sea.\r\n\r\nSecond. The overlying unstratified boulder clays 3 and 4 were thrown\r\ndown in deeper water by the aid of floating ice coming from the north.\r\n\r\nThird. Irregular subsidences then began, and occasionally partial\r\nfailures of support, causing the bending and sometimes the engulfment\r\nof overlying masses both of the Chalk and drift, and causing the\r\nvarious dislocations above described and depicted. The downward movement\r\ncontinued till it exceeded 400 feet, for upon the surface even of Number\r\n5, in some parts of the island, lie huge erratics 20 feet or more\r\nin diameter, which imply that they were carried by ice in a sea of\r\nsufficient depth to float large icebergs. But these big erratics, says\r\nPuggaard, never enter into the fissures as they would have done had they\r\nbeen of date anterior to the convulsions.\r\n\r\nFourth. After this subsidence, the re-elevation and partial denudation\r\nof the Cretaceous and glacial beds took place during a general upward\r\nmovement, like that now experienced in parts of Sweden and Norway.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the lines of movement in Moen, M. Puggaard believes, after\r\nan elaborate comparison of the cliffs with the interior of the island,\r\nthat they took at least three distinct directions at as many\r\nsuccessive eras, all of post-glacial date; the first line running from\r\neast-south-east to west-north-west, with lines of fracture at\r\nright angles to them; the second running from south-south-east to\r\nnorth-north-west, also with fractures in a transverse direction; and\r\nlastly, a sinking in a north and south direction, with other subsidences\r\nof contemporaneous date running at right angles or east and west.\r\n\r\nWhen we approach the north-west end of Moens Klint, or the range of\r\ncoast above described, the strata begin to be less bent and broken,\r\nand after travelling for a short distance beyond we find the Chalk and\r\noverlying drift in the same horizontal position as at the southern end\r\nof the Moens Klint. What makes these convulsions the more striking is\r\nthe fact that in the other adjoining Danish islands, as well as in a\r\nlarge part of Moen itself, both the Secondary and Tertiary formations\r\nare quite undisturbed.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to behold such effects of reiterated local movements,\r\nall of post-Tertiary date, without reflecting that, but for the\r\naccidental presence of the stratified drift, all of which might easily\r\nhave been missing, where there has been so much denudation, even if it\r\nhad once existed, we might have referred the verticality and flexures\r\nand faults of the rocks to an ancient period, such as the era between\r\nthe Chalk with flints and the Maestricht Chalk, or to the time of the\r\nlatter formation, or to the Eocene, or Miocene, or Pliocene eras, even\r\nthe last of them long prior to the commencement of the glacial epoch.\r\nHence we may be permitted to suspect that in some other regions, where\r\nwe have no such means at our command for testing the exact date of\r\ncertain movements, the time of their occurrence may be far more modern\r\nthan we usually suppose. In this way some apparent anomalies in the\r\nposition of erratic blocks, seen occasionally at great heights above the\r\nparent rocks from which they have been detached, might be explained, as\r\nwell as the irregular direction of certain glacial furrows like those\r\ndescribed by Professor Keilhau and Mr. Horbye on the mountains of\r\nthe Dovrefjeld in latitude 62 degrees north, where the striation and\r\nfriction is said to be independent of the present shape and slope of the\r\nmountains.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Observations sur les Phenomenes d'Erosion en Norwege\"\r\n     1857.)\r\n\r\nAlthough even in such cases it remains to be proved whether a general\r\ncrust of continental ice, like that of Greenland described by Rink (see\r\nabove, Chapter 13), would not account for the deviation of the furrows\r\nand striae from the normal directions which they ought to have followed\r\nhad they been due to separate glaciers filling the existing valleys.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in general the upward movements in Scandinavia, which\r\nhave raised sea-beaches containing marine shells of Recent species to\r\nthe height of several hundred feet, have been tolerably uniform over\r\nvery wide spaces; yet a remarkable exception to this rule was observed\r\nby M. Bravais at Altenfjord in Finmark, between latitude 70 and 71\r\ndegrees north. An ancient water-level, indicated by a sandy deposit\r\nforming a terrace and by marks of the erosion of the waves, can be\r\nfollowed for 30 miles from south to north along the borders of a fjord\r\nrising gradually from a height of 85 feet to an elevation of 220 feet\r\nabove the sea, or at the rate of about 4 feet in a mile.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Proceedings of the Geological Society\" 1845 volume 4\r\n     page 94.)\r\n\r\nTo pass to another and very remote part of the world, we have witnessed\r\nso late as January 1855 in the northern island of New Zealand a sudden\r\nand permanent rise of land on the northern shores of Cook's Straits,\r\nwhich at one point, called Muko-muka, was so unequal as to amount to\r\n9 feet vertically, while it declined gradually from this maximum of\r\nupheaval in a distance of about 23 miles north-west of the greatest\r\nrise, to a point where no change of level was perceptible. Mr. Edward\r\nRoberts of the Royal Engineers, employed by the British Government\r\nat the time of the shock in executing public works on the coast,\r\nascertained that the extreme upheaval of certain ancient rocks followed\r\na line of fault running at least 90 miles from south to north into the\r\ninterior; and what is of great geological interest, immediately to the\r\neast of this fault the country, consisting of Tertiary strata, remained\r\nunmoved or stationary; a fact well established by the position of a line\r\nof Nullipores marking the sea-level before the earthquake, both on the\r\nsurface of the Tertiary and Palaeozoic rocks.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Bulletin de la Societe Geologique de France\" volume 13\r\n     1856 page 660, where I have described the facts communicated\r\n     to me by Messrs. Roberts and Walter Mantell.)\r\n\r\nThe repetition of such unequal movements, especially if they recurred at\r\nintervals along the same lines of fracture, would in the course of ages\r\ncause the strata to dip at a high angle in one direction, while towards\r\nthe opposite point of the compass they would terminate abruptly in a\r\nsteep escarpment.\r\n\r\nBut it is probable that the multiplication of such movements in the\r\npost-Tertiary period has rarely been so great as to produce results like\r\nthose above described in Moen, for the principal movements in any given\r\nperiod seem to be of a more uniform kind, by which the topography of\r\nlimited districts and the position of the strata are not visibly altered\r\nexcept in their height relatively to the sea. Were it otherwise we\r\nshould not find conformable strata of all ages, including the primary\r\nfossiliferous of shallow-water origin, which must have remained\r\nhorizontal throughout vast areas during downward movements of several\r\nthousand feet going on at the period of their accumulation. Still less\r\nshould we find the same primary strata, such as the Carboniferous,\r\nDevonian, or Silurian, still remaining horizontal over thousands of\r\nsquare leagues, as in parts of North America and Russia, having escaped\r\ndislocation and flexure throughout the entire series of epochs\r\nwhich separate Palaeozoic from Recent times. Not that they have been\r\nmotionless, for they have undergone so much denudation, and of such\r\na kind, as can only be explained by supposing the strata to have been\r\nsubjected to great oscillations of level, and exposed in some cases\r\nrepeatedly to the destroying and planing action of the waves of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the successive convulsions in Moen were\r\ncontemporary with those upward and downward movements of the glacial\r\nperiod which were described in the thirteenth and some of the following\r\nchapters, and that they ended before the upper beds of Number 5, Figure\r\n49, with its large erratic blocks, were deposited, as some of those\r\nbeds occurring in the disturbed parts of Moen appear to have escaped the\r\nconvulsions to which Numbers 2, 3, and 4 were subjected. If this be so,\r\nthe whole derangement, although Pleistocene, may have been anterior to\r\nthe human epoch, or rather to the earliest date to which the existence\r\nof man has as yet been traced back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18. -- THE GLACIAL PERIOD IN NORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n  Post-glacial Strata containing Remains of Mastodon giganteus\r\n     in North America.\r\n  Scarcity of Marine Shells in Glacial Drift of Canada and the\r\n     United States.\r\n  Greater southern Extension of Ice-action in North America\r\n     than in Europe.\r\n  Trains of Erratic Blocks of vast Size in Berkshire, Massachusetts.\r\n  Description of their Linear Arrangement and Points of Departure.\r\n  Their Transportation referred to Floating and Coast Ice.\r\n  General Remarks on the Causes of former Changes of Climate at\r\n     successive geological Epochs.\r\n  Supposed Effects of the Diversion of the Gulf Stream in a\r\n     Northerly instead of North-Easterly Direction.\r\n  Development of extreme Cold on the opposite Sides of the Atlantic\r\n     in the Glacial period not strictly simultaneous.\r\n  Effect of Marine Currents on Climate.\r\n  Pleistocene Submergence of the Sahara.\r\n\r\nOn the North American continent, between the arctic circle and the 42nd\r\nparallel of latitude, we meet with signs of ice-action on a scale as\r\ngrand as, if not grander than, in Europe; and there also the excess of\r\ncold appears to have been first felt at the close of the Tertiary, and\r\nto have continued throughout a large portion of the Pleistocene period.\r\n[36]\r\n\r\nThe general absence of organic remains in the North American glacial\r\nformation makes it as difficult as in Europe to determine what mammalia\r\nlived on the continent at the time of the most intense refrigeration, or\r\nwhen extensive areas were becoming strewed over with glacial drift and\r\nerratic blocks, but it is certain that a large proboscidean now extinct,\r\nthe Mastodon giganteus, Cuv., together with many other quadrupeds, some\r\nof them now living and others extinct, played a conspicuous part in the\r\npost-glacial era. By its frequency as a fossil species, this pachyderm\r\nrepresents the European Elephas primigenius, although the latter also\r\noccurs fossil in the United States and Canada, and abounds, as I learn\r\nfrom Sir John Richardson, in latitudes farther north than those to which\r\nthe mastodon has been traced.\r\n\r\nIn the state of New York, the mastodon is not unfrequently met with\r\nin bogs and lacustrine deposits formed in hollows in the drift, and\r\ntherefore, in a geological position, much resembling that of Recent\r\npeat and shell-marl in the British Isles, Denmark, or the valley of\r\nthe Somme, as before described. Sometimes entire skeletons have been\r\ndiscovered within a few feet of the surface, in peaty earth at the\r\nbottom of small ponds, which the agriculturists had drained. The shells\r\nin these cases belong to freshwater genera, such as Limnaea, Physa,\r\nPlanorbis, Cyclas, and others, differing from European species, but\r\nthe same as those now proper to ponds and lakes in the same parts of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere given an account of several of these localities which\r\nI visited in 1842,* and can state that they certainly have a more modern\r\naspect than almost all the European deposits in which remains of the\r\nmammoth occur, although a few instances are cited of Elephas Primigenius\r\nhaving been dug out of peat in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Travels in North America\" volume 1 page 55 London 1845;\r\n     and \"Manual of Geology\" chapter 12 5th edition page 144.)\r\n\r\nThus I was shown a mammoth's tooth in the museum at Torquay in\r\nDevonshire which is believed to have been dredged up from a deposit\r\nof vegetable matter now partially submerged beneath the sea. A more\r\nelevated part of the same peaty formation constitutes the bottom of\r\nthe valley in which Tor Abbey stands. This individual elephant must\r\ncertainly have been of more modern date than his fellows found fossil in\r\nthe gravel of the Brixham cave, before described, for it flourished when\r\nthe physical geography of Devonshire, unlike that of the cave period,\r\nwas almost identical with that now established.\r\n\r\nI cannot help suspecting that many tusks and teeth of the mammoth, said\r\nto have been found in peat, may be as spurious as are the horns of\r\nthe rhinoceros cited more than once in the \"Memoirs of the Wernerian\r\nSociety\" as having been obtained from shell-marl in Forfarshire and\r\nother Scotch counties; yet, between the period when the mammoth was\r\nmost abundant and that when it died out, there must have elapsed a long\r\ninterval of ages when it was growing more and more scarce; and we may\r\nexpect to find occasional stragglers buried in deposits long subsequent\r\nin date to others, until at last we may succeed in tracing a passage\r\nfrom the Pleistocene to the Recent fauna, by geological monuments, which\r\nwill fill up the gap before alluded to as separating the era of the\r\nflint tools of Amiens and Abbeville from that of the peat of the valley\r\nof the Somme.\r\n\r\nHow far the lacustrine strata of North America above mentioned may help\r\nto lessen this hiatus, and whether some individuals of the Mastodon\r\ngiganteus may have come down to the confines of the historical period,\r\nis a question not so easily answered as might at first sight be\r\nsupposed. A geologist might naturally imagine that the fluviatile\r\nformation of Goat Island, seen at the falls of Niagara, and at several\r\npoints below the falls,* was very modern, seeing that the fossil shells\r\ncontained in it are all of species now inhabiting the waters of the\r\nNiagara, and seeing also that the deposit is more modern than the\r\nglacial drift of the same locality.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Travels in North America\" by the author, volume 1\r\n     chapter 2 and volume 2 chapter 19.)\r\n\r\nIn fact, the old river bed, in which bones of the mastodon occur, holds\r\nthe same position relatively to the boulder formation as the strata\r\nof shell-marl and bog-earth with bones of mastodon, so frequent in\r\nthe State of New York, bear to the glacial drift, and all may be of\r\ncontemporaneous date. But in the case of the valley of the Niagara\r\nwe happen to have a measure of time which is wanting in the other\r\nlocalities, namely, the test afforded by the recession of the falls, an\r\noperation still in progress, by which the deep ravine of the Niagara,\r\n7 miles long, between Queenstown and Goat Island has been hollowed out.\r\nThis ravine is not only post-glacial, but also posterior in date to\r\nthe fluviatile or mastodon-bearing beds. The individual therefore found\r\nfossil near Goat Island flourished before the gradual excavation of the\r\ndeep and long chasm, and we must reckon its antiquity, not by thousands,\r\nbut by tens of thousands of years, if I have correctly estimated\r\nthe minimum of time which was required for the erosion of that great\r\nravine.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles of Geology\" 9th edition page 2; and \"Travels\r\n     in North America\" volume 1 page 32 1845.)\r\n\r\nThe stories widely circulated of bones of the mastodon having been\r\nobserved with their surfaces pierced as if by arrow-heads or bearing\r\nthe marks of wounds inflicted by some stone implement, must in future\r\nbe more carefully inquired into, for we can scarcely doubt that the\r\nmastodon in North America lived down to a period when the mammoth\r\nco-existed with Man in Europe. But I need say no more on this subject,\r\nhaving already explained my views in regard to the evidence of the\r\nantiquity of Man in North America when treating of the human bone\r\ndiscovered at Natchez on the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIn Canada and the United States we experience the same difficulty as\r\nin Europe when we attempt to distinguish between glacial formations\r\nof submarine and those of supra-marine origin. In the New World, as in\r\nScotland and England, marine shells of this era have rarely been traced\r\nhigher than 500 feet above the sea, and 700 feet seems to be the maximum\r\nto which at present they are known to ascend. In the same countries,\r\nerratic blocks have travelled from north to south, following the same\r\ndirection as the glacial furrows and striae imprinted almost everywhere\r\non the solid rocks underlying the drift. Their direction rarely deviates\r\nmore than fifteen degrees east or west of the meridian, so that we can\r\nscarcely doubt, in spite of the general dearth of marine shells, that\r\nicebergs floating in the sea and often running aground on its rocky\r\nbottom were the instruments by which most of the blocks were conveyed to\r\nsouthern latitudes.\r\n\r\nThere are, nevertheless, in the United States, as in Europe, several\r\ngroups of mountains which have acted as independent centres for the\r\ndispersion of erratics, as, for example, the White Mountains, latitude\r\n44 degrees north, the highest of which, Mount Washington, rises to about\r\n6300 feet above the sea; and according to Professor Hitchcock some of\r\nthe loftiest of the hills of Massachusetts once sent down their glaciers\r\ninto the surrounding lower country.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT SOUTHERN EXTENSION OF TRAINS OF ERRATIC BLOCKS IN BERKSHIRE,\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, U.S., LATITUDE 42 DEGREES NORTH.\r\n\r\nHaving treated so fully in this volume of the events of the glacial\r\nperiod, I am unwilling to conclude without laying before the reader the\r\nevidence displayed in North America of ice-action in latitudes farther\r\nsouth by about ten degrees than any seen on an equal scale in Europe.\r\nThis extension southwards of glacial phenomena in regions where there\r\nare no snow-covered mountains like the Alps to explain the exception,\r\nnor any hills of more than moderate elevation, constitutes a feature of\r\nthe western as compared to the eastern side of the Atlantic, and must be\r\ntaken into account when we speculate on the causes of the refrigeration\r\nof the northern hemisphere during the Pleistocene period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 50.

A well-defined train of limestone blocks, with a few\r\n     of the Canaan rock, traced from the Richmond to the slope\r\n     of the Lenox range.)\r\n\r\nIn 1852, accompanied by Mr. James Hall, state geologist of New York,\r\nauthor of many able and well-known works on geology and palaeontology,\r\nI examined the glacial drift and erratics of the county of Berkshire,\r\nMassachusetts, and those of the adjoining parts of the state of New\r\nYork, a district about 130 miles inland from the Atlantic coast and\r\nsituated due west of Boston in latitude 42 degrees 25 minutes north.\r\nThis latitude corresponds in Europe to that of the north of Portugal.\r\nHere numerous detached fragments of rock are seen, having a linear\r\narrangement or being continuous in long parallel trains, running nearly\r\nin straight lines over hill and dale for distances of 5, 10, and 20\r\nmiles, and sometimes greater distances. Seven of the more conspicuous\r\nof these trains, from 1 to 7 inclusive, Figure 50, are laid down in the\r\naccompanying map or ground plan.*\r\n\r\n     (* This ground plan, and a farther account of the Berkshire\r\n     erratics was given in an abstract of a lecture delivered by\r\n     me to the Royal Institution of Great Britain, April 27, 1855\r\n     and published in their Proceedings.)\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked that they run in a north-west and south-east\r\ndirection, or almost transversely to the ranges of hills A, B, and C,\r\nwhich run north-north-east and south-south-west. The crests of these\r\nchains are about 800 feet in height above the intervening valleys. The\r\nblocks of the northernmost train, Number 7, are of limestone derived\r\nfrom the calcareous chain B; those of the two trains next to the south,\r\nNumbers 6 and 5, are composed exclusively in the first part of their\r\ncourse of a green chloritic rock of great toughness, but after they have\r\npassed the ridge B, a mixture of calcareous blocks is observed. After\r\ntraversing the valley for a distance of 6 miles these two trains pass\r\nthrough depressions or gaps in the range C, as they had previously done\r\nin crossing the range B, showing that the dispersion of the erratics\r\nbears some relation to the acutal inequalities of the surface, although\r\nthe course of the same blocks is perfectly independent of the more\r\nleading features of the geography of the country, or those by which\r\nthe present lines of drainage are determined. The greater number of the\r\ngreen chloritic fragments in trains 5 and 6 have evidently come from the\r\nridge A, and a large proportion of the whole from its highest summit d,\r\nwhere the crest of the ridge has been worn into those dome-shaped\r\nmasses called \"roches moutonnees,\" already alluded to, and where several\r\nfragments having this shape, some of them 30 feet long, are seen in\r\nsitu, others only slightly removed from their original position, as if\r\nthey had been just ready to set out on their travels. Although smooth\r\nand rounded on their tops they are angular on their lower parts, where\r\ntheir outline has been derived from the natural joints of the rock. Had\r\nthese blocks been conveyed from d by glaciers, they would have radiated\r\nin all directions from a centre, whereas not one even of the smaller\r\nones is found to the westward of A, though a very slight force would\r\nhave made them roll down to the base of that ridge, which is very steep\r\non its western declivity. It is clear, therefore, that the propelling\r\npower, whatever it may have been, acted exclusively in a south-easterly\r\ndirection. Professor Hall and I observed one of the green blocks--24\r\nfeet long, poised upon another about 19 feet in length. The largest of\r\nall on the west flank of m, or Dupey's Mount, called the Alderman, is\r\nabove 90 feet in diameter, and nearly 300 feet in circumference. We\r\ncounted at some points between forty and fifty blocks visible at once,\r\nthe smallest of them larger than a camel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 51. Dome-Shaped Block]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 51. ERRATIC DOME-SHAPED BLOCK OF COMPACT CHLORITIC ROCK\r\n  (n in map in Figure 50), near the Richmond Meeting-house,\r\n    Berkshire, Massachusetts, latitude 42 degrees 25 minutes\r\n    North. Length, 52 feet; width, 40 feet; height above the\r\n    soil, 15 feet.)\r\n\r\nThe annexed drawing (Figure 51) represents one of the best known of\r\ntrain Number 6, being that marked n on the map (Figure 50). According to\r\nour measurement it is 52 feet long by 40 in width, its height above the\r\ndrift in which it is partially buried being 15 feet. At the distance\r\nof several yards occurs a smaller block, 3 or 4 feet in height, 20 feet\r\nlong, and 14 broad, composed of the same compact chloritic rock, and\r\nevidently a detached fragment from the bigger mass, to the lower and\r\nangular part of which it would fit on exactly. This erratic n has a\r\nregularly rounded top, worn and smoothed like the \"roches moutonnees\"\r\nbefore mentioned, but no part of the attrition can have occurred since\r\nit left its parent rock, the angles of the lower portion being quite\r\nsharp and unblunted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 52. Position of Block in Figure 51]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 52. SECTION SHOWING THE POSITION OF THE BLOCK IN FIGURE 51.\r\n\r\n  a. The large block in Figure 51 and n in the map in Figure 50.\r\n  b. Fragment detached from the same.\r\n  c. Unstratified drift with boulders.\r\n  d. Silurian limestone in inclined stratification.)\r\n\r\nFrom railway cuttings through the drift of the neighbourhood and other\r\nartificial excavations, we may infer that the position of the block n,\r\nif seen in a vertical section, would be as represented in Figure 52. The\r\ndeposit c in that section consists of sand, mud, gravel, and stones,\r\nfor the most part unstratified, resembling the till or boulder clay\r\nof Europe. It varies in thickness from 10 to 50 feet, being of greater\r\ndepth in the valleys. The uppermost portion is occasionally, though\r\nrarely, stratified. Some few of the imbedded stones have flattened,\r\npolished, striated, and furrowed sides. They consist invariably, like\r\nthe seven trains above mentioned, of kinds of rock confined to the\r\nregion lying to the north-west, none of them having come from any other\r\nquarter. Whenever the surface of the underlying rock has been exposed by\r\nthe removal of the superficial detritus, a polished and furrowed surface\r\nis seen, like that underneath a glacier, the direction of the furrows\r\nbeing from north-west to south-east, or corresponding to the course of\r\nthe large erratics.\r\n\r\nAs all the blocks, instead of being dispersed from a centre, have\r\nbeen carried in one direction and across the ridges A, B, C and the\r\nintervening valleys, the hypothesis of glaciers is out of the question.\r\nI conceive, therefore, that the erratics were conveyed to the places\r\nthey now occupy by coast ice, when the country was submerged beneath the\r\nwaters of a sea cooled by icebergs coming annually from arctic regions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 53. Canaan And Richmond Valleys]\r\n\r\n  (FIGURE 53. SECTION THROUGH CANAAN AND RICHMOND VALLEYS AT A TIME\r\n   WHEN THEY WERE MARINE CHANNELS.\r\n\r\n  d, e. Masses of floating ice carrying fragments of rock.)\r\n\r\nSuppose the highest peaks of the ridges A, B, C in the annexed diagram\r\n(Figure 53) to be alone above water, forming islands, and d e to be\r\nmasses of floating ice, which drifted across the Canaan and Richmond\r\nvalleys at a time when they were marine channels, separating islands or\r\nrather chains of islands, having a north-north-east and south-south-west\r\ndirection. A fragment of ice such as d, freighted with a block from A,\r\nmight run aground and add to the heap of erratics at the north-west base\r\nof the island (now ridge) B, or, passing through a sound between B and\r\nthe next island of the same group, might float on till it reached the\r\nchannel between B and C. Year after year two such exposed cliffs in the\r\nCanaan range as d and e of the map, Figure 50, undermined by the waves,\r\nmight serve as the points of departure of blocks, composing the trains\r\nNumbers 5 and 6. It may be objected that oceanic currents could not\r\nalways have had the same direction; this may be true, but during a short\r\nseason of the year when the ice was breaking up the prevailing current\r\nmay have always run south-east.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked why the blocks of each train are not more scattered,\r\nespecially when far from their source, it may be observed that after\r\npassing through sounds separating islands, they issued again from a\r\nnew and narrow starting-point; moreover, we must not exaggerate the\r\nregularity of the trains, as their width is sometimes twice as great\r\nin one place in as another; and Number 6 sends off a branch at p, which\r\njoins Number 5. There are also stragglers, or large blocks here and\r\nthere in the spaces between the two trains. As to the distance to which\r\nany given block would be carried, that must have depended on a variety\r\nof circumstances; such as the strength of the current, the direction of\r\nthe wind, the weight of the block or the quantity and draught of the ice\r\nattached to it. The smaller fragments would, on the whole, have the best\r\nchance of going farthest; because, in the first place, they were more\r\nnumerous, and then, being lighter, they required less ice to float them,\r\nand would not ground so readily on shoals, or if stranded, would be\r\nmore easily started again on their travels. Many of the blocks, which at\r\nfirst sight seem to consist of single masses, are found when examined to\r\nbe made up of two, three, or more pieces divided by natural joints. In\r\nthe case of a second removal by ice, one or more portions would become\r\ndetached and be drifted to different points further on. Whenever this\r\nhappened, the original size would be lessened, and the angularity of\r\nthe block previously worn by the breakers would be restored, and this\r\ntendency to split may explain why some of the far-transported fragments\r\nremain very angular.\r\n\r\nThese various considerations may also account for the fact that the\r\naverage size of the blocks of all the seven trains laid down on the\r\nplan, Figure 50, lessens sensibly in proportion as we recede from the\r\nprincipal points of departure of particular kinds of erratics, yet not\r\nwith any regularity, a huge block now and then recurring when the rest\r\nof the train consists of smaller ones.\r\n\r\nAll geologists acquainted with the district now under consideration are\r\nagreed that the mountain ranges A, B, and c, as well as the adjoining\r\nvalleys, had assumed their actual form and position before the drift and\r\nerratics accumulated on and in them and before the surface of the fixed\r\nrocks was polished and furrowed. I have the less hesitation in ascribing\r\nthe transporting power to coast-ice, because I saw in 1852 an angular\r\nblock of sandstone, 8 feet in diameter, which had been brought down\r\nseveral miles by ice only three years before to the mouth of the\r\nPetitcodiac estuary, in Nova Scotia, where it joins the Bay of Fundy;\r\nand I ascertained that on the shores of the same bay, at the South\r\nJoggins, in the year 1850, much larger blocks had been removed by\r\ncoast-ice, and after they had floated half a mile, had been dropped in\r\nsalt water by the side of a pier built for loading vessels with coal,\r\nso that it was necessary at low tide to blast these huge ice-borne\r\nrocks with gunpowder in order that the vessels might be able to draw up\r\nalongside the pier. These recent exemplifications of the vast carrying\r\npowers of ice occurred in latitude 46 degrees north (corresponding to\r\nthat of Bordeaux), in a bay never invaded by icebergs.\r\n\r\nI may here remark that a sheet of ice of moderate thickness, if it\r\nextend over a wide area, may suffice to buoy up the largest erratics\r\nwhich fall upon it. The size of these will depend, not on the intensity\r\nof the cold but on the manner in which the rock is jointed, and the\r\nconsequent dimensions of the blocks into which it splits when falling\r\nfrom an undermined cliff.\r\n\r\nWhen I first endeavoured in the \"Principles of Geology\" in 1830,* to\r\nexplain the causes, both of the warmer and colder climates which have\r\nat former periods prevailed on the globe, I referred to successive\r\nvariations in the height and position of the land and its extent\r\nrelatively to the sea in polar and equatorial latitudes--also to\r\nfluctuations in the course of oceanic currents and other geographical\r\nconditions, by the united influence of which I still believe the\r\nprincipal revolutions in the meteorological state of the atmosphere at\r\ndifferent geological periods have been brought about.\r\n\r\n     (* 1st edition chapter 7; 9th edition ibid.)\r\n\r\nThe Gulf Stream was particularly alluded to by me as moderating the\r\nwinter climate of northern Europe and as depending for its direction\r\non temporary and accidental peculiarities in the shape of the land,\r\nespecially that of the narrow Straits of Bahama, which a slight\r\nmodification in the earth's crust would entirely alter.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins, in a valuable essay on the causes of former changes of\r\nclimate,*nhas attempted to calculate how much the annual temperature of\r\nEurope would be lowered if this Gulf Stream were turned in some other\r\nand new direction, and estimates the amount at about six or seven\r\ndegrees of Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n     (* Hopkins, \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\"\r\n     volume 8 1852 page 56.)\r\n\r\nHe also supposes that if at the same time a considerable part of\r\nnorthern and central Europe were submerged, so that a cold current from\r\nthe arctic seas should sweep over it, an additional refrigeration of\r\nthree or four degrees would be produced. He has speculated in the\r\nsame essay on the effects which would be experienced in the eastern\r\nhemisphere if the same mighty current of warm water, instead of crossing\r\nthe Atlantic, were made to run northwards from the Gulf of Mexico\r\nthrough the region now occupied by the valley of the Mississippi, and so\r\nonwards to the arctic regions.\r\n\r\nAfter reflecting on what has been said in the thirteenth chapter of\r\nthe submergence and re-elevation of the British Isles and the adjoining\r\nparts of Europe, and the rising and sinking of the Alps and the\r\nbasins of some of the great rivers flowing from that chain, since the\r\ncommencement of the glacial period, a geologist will not be disposed to\r\nobject to the theory above adverted to, on the score of its demanding\r\ntoo much conversion of land into sea, or almost any amount of\r\ngeographical change in Pleistocene times. But a difficulty of another\r\nkind presents itself. We have seen that, during the glacial period, the\r\ncold in Europe extended much farther south than it does at present, and\r\nin this chapter we have demonstrated that in North America the cold also\r\nextended no less than 10 degrees of latitude still farther southwards\r\nthan in Europe; so that if a great body of heated water, instead of\r\nflowing north-eastward, were made to pass through what is now the centre\r\nof the American continent towards the Arctic Circle, it could not\r\nfail to mitigate the severity of the winter's cold in precisely those\r\nlatitudes where the cold was greatest and where it has left monuments\r\nof ice-action surpassing in extent any exhibited on the European side of\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nIn the actual state of the globe, the isothermal lines, or lines of\r\nequal winter temperature when traced westward from Europe to North\r\nAmerica bend 10 degrees south, there being a marked excess of winter\r\ncold in corresponding latitudes west of the Atlantic. During the glacial\r\nperiod, viewing it as a whole, we behold signs of a precisely similar\r\ndeflection of these same isothermal lines when followed from east to\r\nwest; so that if, in the hope of accounting for the former severity of\r\nglacial action in Europe, we suppose the absence of the Gulf Stream and\r\nimagine a current of equivalent magnitude to have flowed due north from\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, we introduce, as we have just hinted, a source\r\nof heat into precisely that part of the continent where the extreme\r\nconditions of refrigeration are most manifest. Viewed in this light, the\r\nhypothesis in question would render the glacial phenomena described in\r\nthe present chapter more perplexing and anomalous than ever. But here\r\nanother question arises, whether the eras at which the maximum of\r\ncold was attained on the opposite sides of the Atlantic were really\r\ncontemporaneous? We have now discovered not only that the glacial period\r\nwas of vast duration, but that it passed through various phases and\r\noscillations of temperature; so that, although the chief polishing and\r\nfurrowing of the rocks and transportation of erratics in Europe and\r\nNorth America may have taken place contemporaneously, according to the\r\nordinary language of geology, or when the same testacea and the\r\nsame Pleistocene assemblage of mammalia flourished, yet the extreme\r\ndevelopment of cold on the opposite sides of the ocean may not have been\r\nstrictly simultaneous, but on the contrary the one may have preceded or\r\nfollowed the other by a thousand or more than a thousand centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the greatest refrigeration of Norway, Sweden,\r\nScotland, Wales, the Vosges, and the Alps coincided very nearly in time;\r\nbut when the Scandinavian and Scotch mountains were encrusted with a\r\ngeneral covering of ice, similar to that now enveloping Greenland, this\r\nlast country may not have been in nearly so glacial a condition as now,\r\njust as we find that the old icy crust and great glaciers, which\r\nhave left their mark on the mountains of Norway and Sweden, have\r\nnow disappeared, precisely at a time when the accumulation of ice in\r\nGreenland is so excessive. In other words, we see that in the present\r\nstate of the northern hemisphere, at the distance of about 1500 miles,\r\ntwo meridional zones enjoying very different conditions of temperature\r\nmay co-exist, and we are, therefore, at liberty to imagine some former\r\nalternations of colder and milder climates on the opposite sides of the\r\nocean throughout the Pleistocene era of a compensating kind, the cold on\r\nthe one side balancing the milder temperature on the other. By assuming\r\nsuch a succession of events we can more easily explain why there has not\r\nbeen a greater extermination of species, both terrestrial and aquatic,\r\nin polar and temperate regions during the glacial epoch, and why so many\r\nspecies are common to pre-glacial and post-glacial times.\r\n\r\nThe numerous plants which are common to the temperate zones north and\r\nsouth of the equator have been referred by Mr. Darwin and Dr. Hooker to\r\nmigrations which took place along mountain chains running from north to\r\nsouth during some of the colder phases of the glacial epoch.*\r\n\r\n     (* Darwin, \"Origin of Species\" chapter 11 page 365; Hooker,\r\n     \"Flora of Australia\" Introduction page 18 1859.)\r\n\r\nSuch an hypothesis enables us to dispense with the doctrine that the\r\nsame species ever originated independently in two distinct and distant\r\nareas; and it becomes more feasible if we admit the doctrine of the\r\nco-existence of meridional belts of warmer and colder climate, instead\r\nof the simultaneous prevalence of extreme cold both in the eastern and\r\nwestern hemisphere. It also seems necessary, as colder currents of water\r\nalways flow to lower latitudes, while warmer ones are running towards\r\npolar regions, that some such compensation should take place, and that\r\nan increase of cold in one region must to a certain extent be balanced\r\nby a mitigation of temperature elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSir John F. Herschel, in his recent work on \"Physical Geography,\" when\r\nspeaking of the open sea which is caused in part of the polar regions\r\nby the escape of ice through Behring's Straits, and the flow of warmer\r\nwater northwards through the same channel, observes that these straits,\r\nby which the continents of Asia and North America are now parted, \"are\r\nonly thirty miles broad where narrowest and only twenty-five fathoms\r\nin their greatest depth.\" But \"this narrow channel,\" he adds, \"is yet\r\nimportant in the economy of nature, inasmuch as it allows a portion\r\nof the circulating water from a warmer region to find its way into the\r\npolar basin, aiding thereby not only to mitigate the extreme rigour of\r\nthe polar cold, but to prevent in all probability a continual accretion\r\nof ice, which else might rise to a mountainous height.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Herschel's \"Physical Geography\" page 41 1861.)\r\n\r\nBehring's Straits, here alluded to, happen to agree singularly in width\r\nand depth with the Straits of Dover, the difference in depth not being\r\nmore than 3 or 4 feet; so that at the rate of upheaval, which is now\r\ngoing on in many parts of Scandinavia, of 2 1/2 feet in a century, such\r\nstraits might be closed in 3000 years, and a vast accumulation of ice to\r\nthe northward commence forthwith.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, although such an accumulation might spread\r\nits refrigerating influence for many miles southwards beyond the new\r\nbarrier, the warm current which now penetrates through the straits, and\r\nwhich at other times is chilled by floating ice issuing from them, would\r\nwhen totally excluded from all communication with the icy sea have its\r\ntemperature raised and its course altered, so that the climate of some\r\nother area must immediately begin to improve.\r\n\r\nThere is still another probable cause of a vast change in the\r\ntemperature of central Europe in comparatively modern times, to which no\r\nallusion has yet been made; namely, the conversion of the great\r\ndesert of the Sahara from sea into land since the commencement of\r\nthe Pleistocene period. When that vast region was still submerged, no\r\nsirocco blowing for days in succession carried its hot blasts from a\r\nwide expanse of burning sand across the Mediterranean. The south winds\r\nwere comparatively cool, allowing the snows of the Alps to augment to an\r\nextent which the colossal dimensions of the moraines of extinct glaciers\r\ncan alone enable us to estimate.\r\n\r\nThe scope and limits of this volume forbid my pursuing these\r\nspeculations and reasonings farther; but I trust I have said enough\r\nto show that the monuments of the glacial period, when more thoroughly\r\ninvestigated, will do much towards expanding our views as to the\r\nantiquity of the fauna and flora now contemporary with Man, and will\r\ntherefore enable us the better to determine the time at which Man began\r\nin the northern hemisphere to form part of the existing fauna.

That of bronze has been traced\r\nback to times anterior to the Roman occupation of Helvetia, Gaul, and\r\nother countries north of the Alps. When weapons of that mixed metal were\r\nin use, a somewhat uniform civilisation seems to have prevailed over\r\na wide extent of central and northern Europe, and the long duration\r\nof such a state of things in Denmark and Switzerland is shown by the\r\ngradual improvement which took place in the useful and ornamental arts.\r\nSuch progress is attested by the increasing variety of the forms,\r\nand the more perfect finish and tasteful decoration of the tools and\r\nutensils obtained from the more modern deposits of the bronze age, those\r\nfrom the upper layers of peat, for example, as compared to those found\r\nin the lower ones. The great number also of the Swiss lake-dwellings of\r\nthe bronze age (about seventy villages having been already discovered),\r\nand the large population which some of them were capable of containing,\r\nafford indication of a considerable lapse of time, as does the thickness\r\nof the stratum of mud in which in some of the lakes the works of art\r\nare entombed. The unequal antiquity, also, of the settlements is\r\noccasionally attested by the different degrees of decay which the wooden\r\nstakes or piles have undergone, some of them projecting more above the\r\nmud than others, while all the piles of the antecedent age of stone have\r\nrotted away quite down to the level of the mud, such part of them\r\nonly as was originally driven into the bed of the lake having escaped\r\ndecomposition.*\r\n\r\n     (* Troyon, \"Habitations lacustres\" Lausanne 1860.)\r\n\r\nAmong the monuments of the stone period, which immediately preceded that\r\nof bronze, the polished hatchets called celts are abundant, and were\r\nin very general use in Europe before metallic tools were introduced. We\r\nlearn, from the Danish peat and shell-mounds, and from the older Swiss\r\nlake-settlements, that the first inhabitants were hunters who fed almost\r\nentirely on game, but their food in after ages consisted more and more\r\nof tamed animals and still later a more complete change to a pastoral\r\nstate took place, accompanied as population increased by the cultivation\r\nof some cereals.\r\n\r\nBoth the shells and quadrupeds belonging to the later stone period\r\nand to the age of bronze consist exclusively of species now living in\r\nEurope, the fauna being the same as that which flourished in Gaul at the\r\ntime when it was conquered by Julius Caesar, even the Bos primigenius,\r\nthe only animal of which the wild type is lost, being still represented,\r\naccording to Cuvier, Bell, and Rutimeyer, by one of the domesticated\r\nraces of cattle now in Europe.\r\n\r\nThese monuments, therefore, whether of stone or bronze, belong to what I\r\nhave termed geologically the Recent period, the definition of which\r\nsome may think rather too dependent on negative evidence, or on the\r\nnon-discovery hitherto of extinct mammalia, such as the mammoth, which\r\nmay one day turn up in a fossil state in some of the oldest peaty\r\ndeposits, as indeed it is already said to have done at some spots,\r\nthough I have failed as yet to obtain authentic evidence of the fact.*\r\n\r\n     (* A molar of E. primigenius, in a very fresh state, in the\r\n     museum at Torquay, believed to have been washed up by the\r\n     waves of the sea out of the submerged mass of vegetable\r\n     matter at the extremity of the valley in which Tor Abbey\r\n     stands, is the best case I have seen. See above, Chapter\r\n     18.)\r\n\r\nNo doubt some such exceptional cases may be met with in the course of\r\nfuture investigations, for we are still imperfectly acquainted with\r\nthe entire fauna of the age of stone in Denmark as we may infer from an\r\nopinion expressed by Steenstrup, that some of the instruments exhumed by\r\nantiquaries from the Danish peat are made of the bones and horns of\r\nthe elk and reindeer. Yet no skeleton or uncut bone of either of those\r\nspecies has hitherto been observed in the same peat.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the examination made by naturalists of the various Danish\r\nand Swiss deposits of the Recent period has been so searching, that the\r\nfinding in them of a stray elephant or rhinoceros, should it ever occur,\r\nwould prove little more than that some few individuals lingered on, when\r\nthe species was on the verge of extinction, and such rare exceptions\r\nwould not render the classification above proposed inappropriate.\r\n\r\nAt the time when many wild quadrupeds and birds were growing scarce and\r\nsome of them becoming locally extirpated in Denmark, great changes were\r\ntaking place in the vegetation. The pine, or Scotch fir, buried in\r\nthe oldest peat, gave place at length to the oak, and the oak, after\r\nflourishing for ages, yielded in its turn to the beech, the periods\r\nwhen these three forest trees predominated in succession tallying pretty\r\nnearly with the ages of stone, bronze, and iron in Denmark. In the same\r\ncountry also, during the stone period, various fluctuations, as we have\r\nseen, occurred in physical geography. Thus, on the ocean side of certain\r\nislands, the old refuse-heaps, or \"kitchen-middens,\" were destroyed\r\nby the waves, the cliffs having wasted away, while on the side of the\r\nBaltic, where the sea was making no encroachment or where the land was\r\nsometimes gaining on the sea, such mounds remained uninjured. It was\r\nalso shown that the oyster, which supplied food to the primitive people,\r\nattained its full size in parts of the Baltic where it cannot now\r\nexist owing to a want of saltness in the water, and that certain marine\r\nunivalves and bivalves, such as the common periwinkle, mussel, and\r\ncockle, of which the castaway shells are found in the mounds, attained\r\nin the olden time their full dimensions, like the oysters, whereas the\r\nsame species, though they still live on the coast of the inland sea\r\nadjoining the mounds, are dwarfed and never half their natural size, the\r\nwater being rendered too fresh for them by the influx of so many rivers.\r\n\r\nSome archaeologists and geologists of merit have endeavoured to\r\narrive at positive dates, or an exact estimate of the minimum of time\r\nassignable to the later age of stone. These computations have been\r\nsometimes founded on changes in the level of the land, or on the\r\nincrease of peat, as in the Danish bogs, or on the conversion of water\r\ninto land by alluvial deposits, since certain lake-settlements in\r\nSwitzerland were abandoned. Alterations also in the geographical\r\ndistribution or preponderance of certain living species of animals and\r\nplants have been taken into account in corroboration, as have the signs\r\nof progress in human civilisation, as serving to mark the lapse of time\r\nduring the stone and bronze epochs.\r\n\r\nM. Morlot has estimated with care the probable antiquity of three\r\nsuperimposed vegetable soils cut open at different depths in the delta\r\nof the Tiniere, each containing human bones or works of art, belonging\r\nsuccessively to the Roman, bronze, and later stone periods. According\r\nto his estimate, an antiquity of 7000 years at least must be assigned\r\nto the oldest of these remains, though believed to be long posterior in\r\ndate to the time when the mammoth and other extinct mammalia flourished\r\ntogether with Man in Europe. Such computations of past time must be\r\nregarded as tentative in the present state of our knowledge and much\r\ncollateral evidence will be required to confirm them; yet the results\r\nappear to me already to afford a rough approximation to the truth.\r\n\r\nBetween the newer or Recent division of the stone period and the older\r\ndivision, which has been called the Pleistocene, there was evidently a\r\nvast interval of time--a gap in the history of the past, into which many\r\nmonuments of intermediate date will one day have to be intercalated. Of\r\nthis kind are those caves in the south of France, in which M. Lartet\r\nhas lately found bones of the reindeer, associated with works of art\r\nsomewhat more advanced in style than those of St. Acheul or of Aurignac.\r\nIn the valley of the Somme we have seen that peat exists of great\r\nthickness, containing in its upper layers Roman and Celtic memorials,\r\nthe whole of which has been of slow growth, in basins or depressions\r\nconforming to the present contour and drainage levels of the country,\r\nand long posterior in date to older gravels, containing bones of the\r\nmammoth and a large number of flint implements of a very rude and\r\nantique type. Some of those gravels were accumulated in the channels\r\nof rivers which flowed at higher levels by 100 feet than the present\r\nstreams, and before the valley had attained its present depth and form.\r\nNo intermixture has been observed in those ancient river beds of any of\r\nthe polished weapons, called \"celts,\" or other relics of the more modern\r\ntimes, or of the second or Recent stone period, nor any interstratified\r\npeat; and the climate of those Pleistocene ages, when Man was a denizen\r\nof the north-west of France and of southern and central England, appears\r\nto have been much more severe in winter than it is now in the\r\nsame region, though far less cold than in the glacial period which\r\nimmediately preceded.\r\n\r\nWe may presume that the time demanded for the gradual dying out or\r\nextirpation of a large number of wild beasts which figure in the\r\nPleistocene strata and are missing in the Recent fauna was of protracted\r\nduration, for we know how tedious a task it is in our own times, even\r\nwith the aid of fire-arms, to exterminate a noxious quadruped, a wolf,\r\nfor example, in any region comprising within it an extensive forest or a\r\nmountain chain. In many villages in the north of Bengal, the tiger still\r\noccasionally carries off its human victims, and the abandonment of late\r\nyears by the natives of a part of the Sunderbunds or lower delta of the\r\nGanges, which they once peopled, is attributed chiefly to the ravages of\r\nthe tiger. It is probable that causes more general and powerful than the\r\nagency of Man, alterations in climate, variations in the range of\r\nmany species of animals, vertebrate and invertebrate, and of plants,\r\ngeographical changes in the height, depth, and extent of land and sea,\r\nsome or all of these combined, have given rise in a vast series of\r\nyears to the annihilation, not only of many large mammalia, but to the\r\ndisappearance of the Cyrena fluminalis, once common in the rivers of\r\nEurope, and to the different range or relative abundance of other shells\r\nwhich we find in the European drifts.\r\n\r\nThat the growing power of Man may have lent its aid as the destroying\r\ncause of many Pleistocene species, must, however, be granted; yet,\r\nbefore the introduction of fire-arms, or even the use of improved\r\nweapons of stone, it seems more wonderful that the aborigines were able\r\nto hold their own against the cave-lion, hyaena, and wild bull, and\r\nto cope with such enemies, than that they failed to bring about their\r\nspeedy extinction.\r\n\r\nIt is already clear that Man was contemporary in Europe with two species\r\nof elephant, now extinct, E. primigenius and E. antiquus, two also of\r\nrhinoceros, R. tichorhinus and R. hemitoechus (Falc.), at least one\r\nspecies of hippopotamus, the cave-bear, cave-lion, and cave-hyaena,\r\nvarious bovine, equine, and cervine animals now extinct, and many\r\nsmaller Carnivora, Rodentia, and Insectivora. While these were slowly\r\npassing away, the musk ox, reindeer, and other arctic species which have\r\nsurvived to our times were retreating northwards from the valleys of the\r\nThames and Seine to their present more arctic haunts.\r\n\r\nThe human skeletons of the Belgian caverns of times coeval with the\r\nmammoth and other extinct mammalia do not betray any signs of a marked\r\ndeparture in their structure, whether of skull or limb, from the\r\nmodern standard of certain living races of the human family. As to\r\nthe remarkable Neanderthal skeleton (Chapter 5), it is at present too\r\nisolated and exceptional, and its age too uncertain, to warrant us\r\nin relying on its abnormal and ape-like characters, as bearing on the\r\nquestion whether the farther back we trace Man into the past, the more\r\nwe shall find him approach in bodily conformation to those species of\r\nthe anthropoid quadrumana which are most akin to him in structure.\r\n\r\nIn the descriptions already given of the geographical changes which\r\nthe British Isles have undergone since the commencement of the glacial\r\nperiod (as illustrated by several maps, Figures 39 to 41), it has been\r\nshown that there must have been a free communication by land between the\r\nContinent and these islands, and between the several islands themselves,\r\nwithin the Pleistocene epoch, in order to account for the Germanic fauna\r\nand flora having migrated into every part of the area, as well as for\r\nthe Scandinavian plants and animals to have retreated into the\r\nhigher mountains. During some part of the Pleistocene ages, the large\r\npachyderms and accompanying beasts of prey, now extinct, wandered from\r\nthe Continent to England; and it is highly probable that France was\r\nunited with some part of the British Isles as late as the period of the\r\ngravels of St. Acheul and the era of those engulfed rivers which, in\r\nthe basin of the Meuse near Liege, swept into many a rent and cavern\r\nthe bones of Man and of the mammoth and cave-bear. There have been vast\r\ngeographical revolutions in the times alluded to, and oscillations of\r\nland, during which the English Channel, which can be shown by the Pagham\r\nerratics and the old Brighton beach (Chapter 14), to be of very ancient\r\norigin, may have been more than once laid dry and again submerged.\r\nDuring some one of these phases, Man may have crossed over, whether by\r\nland or in canoes, or even on the ice of a frozen sea (as Mr. Prestwich\r\nhas hinted), for the winters of the period of the higher-level gravels\r\nof the valley of the Somme were intensely cold.\r\n\r\nThe primitive people, who co-existed with the elephant and rhinoceros\r\nin the valley of the Ouse at Bedford, and who made use of flint tools of\r\nthe Amiens type, certainly inhabited part of England which had already\r\nemerged from the waters of the glacial sea and the fabricators of\r\nthe flint tools of Hoxne, in Suffolk, were also, as we have seen,\r\npost-glacial. We may likewise presume that the people of Pleistocene\r\ndate, who have left their memorials in the valley of the Thames, were of\r\ncorresponding antiquity, posterior to the boulder clay but anterior to\r\nthe time when the rivers of that region had settled into their present\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nThe vast distance of time which separated the origin of the higher and\r\nlower gravels of the valley of the Somme, both of them rich in flint\r\nimplements of similar shape (although those of oval form predominate in\r\nthe newer gravels), leads to the conclusion that the state of the arts\r\nin those early times remained stationary for almost indefinite periods.\r\nThere may, however, have been different degrees of civilisation and in\r\nthe art of fabricating flint tools, of which we cannot easily detect the\r\nsigns in the first age of stone, and some contemporary tribes may have\r\nbeen considerably in advance of others. Those hunters, for example, who\r\nfeasted on the rhinoceros and buried their dead with funeral rites at\r\nAurignac may have been less barbarous than the savages of St. Acheul,\r\nas some of their weapons and utensils have been thought to imply. To\r\na European who looks down from a great eminence on the products of the\r\nhumble arts of the aborigines of all times and countries, the stone\r\nknives and arrows of the Red Indian of North America, the hatchets\r\nof the native Australian, the tools found in the ancient Swiss\r\nlake-dwellings or those of the Danish kitchen-middens and of St. Acheul,\r\nseem nearly all alike in rudeness and very uniform in general character.\r\nThe slowness of the progress of the arts of savage life is manifested\r\nby the fact that the earlier instruments of bronze were modelled on the\r\nexact plan of the stone tools of the preceding age, although such shapes\r\nwould never have been chosen had metals been known from the first. The\r\nreluctance or incapacity of savage tribes to adopt new inventions has\r\nbeen shown in the East by their continuing to this day to use the same\r\nstone implements as their ancestors, after that mighty empires, where\r\nthe use of metals in the arts was well known, had flourished for three\r\nthousand years in their neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWe see in our own times that the rate of progress in the arts and\r\nsciences proceeds in a geometrical ratio as knowledge increases, and so\r\nwhen we carry back our retrospect into the past, we must be prepared to\r\nfind the signs of retardation augmenting in a like geometrical ratio; so\r\nthat the progress of a thousand years at a remote period may correspond\r\nto that of a century in modern times, and in ages still more remote Man\r\nwould more and more resemble the brutes in that attribute which causes\r\none generation exactly to imitate in all its ways the generation which\r\npreceded it.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which even a considerably advanced state of civilisation\r\nmay become fixed and stereotyped for ages, is the wonder of Europeans\r\nwho travel in the East. One of my friends declared to me, that whenever\r\nthe natives expressed to him a wish \"that he might live a thousand\r\nyears,\" the idea struck him as by no means extravagant, seeing that if\r\nhe were doomed to sojourn for ever among them, he could only hope to\r\nexchange in ten centuries as many ideas, and to witness as much progress\r\nas he could do at home in half a century.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes happened that one nation has been conquered by another\r\nless civilised though more warlike, or that during social and political\r\nrevolutions, people have retrograded in knowledge. In such cases, the\r\ntraditions of earlier ages, or of some higher and more educated caste\r\nwhich has been destroyed, may give rise to the notion of degeneracy from\r\na primaeval state of superior intelligence, or of science supernaturally\r\ncommunicated. But had the original stock of mankind been really endowed\r\nwith such superior intellectual powers and with inspired knowledge and\r\nhad possessed the same improvable nature as their posterity, the point\r\nof advancement which they would have reached ere this would have been\r\nimmeasurably higher. We cannot ascertain at present the limits,\r\nwhether of the beginning or the end, of the first stone period when Man\r\nco-existed with the extinct mammalia, but that it was of great duration\r\nwe cannot doubt. During those ages there would have been time for\r\nprogress of which we can scarcely form a conception, and very different\r\nwould have been the character of the works of art which we should now\r\nbe endeavouring to interpret--those relics which we are now disinterring\r\nfrom the old gravel-pits of St. Acheul, or from the Liege caves. In\r\nthem, or in the upraised bed of the Mediterranean, on the south coast of\r\nSardinia, instead of the rudest pottery or flint tools so irregular\r\nin form as to cause the unpractised eye to doubt whether they afford\r\nunmistakable evidence of design, we should now be finding sculptured\r\nforms surpassing in beauty the masterpieces of Phidias or Praxiteles;\r\nlines of buried railways or electric telegraphs from which the\r\nbest engineers of our day might gain invaluable hints; astronomical\r\ninstruments and microscopes of more advanced construction than any known\r\nin Europe, and other indications of perfection in the arts and sciences\r\nsuch as the nineteenth century has not yet witnessed. Still farther\r\nwould the triumphs of inventive genius be found to have been carried,\r\nwhen the later deposits, now assigned to the ages of bronze and iron,\r\nwere formed. Vainly should we be straining our imaginations to guess\r\nthe possible uses and meaning of such relics--machines, perhaps,\r\nfor navigating the air or exploring the depths of the ocean, or\r\nfor calculating arithmetical problems beyond the wants or even the\r\nconception of living mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThe opinion entertained generally by the classical writers of Greece and\r\nRome, that Man in the first stage of his existence was but just removed\r\nfrom the brutes, is faithfully expressed by Horace in his celebrated\r\nlines, which begin:--\r\n\r\nQuum prorepserunt primis animalia terris.--Sat. lib. 1, 3, 99.\r\n\r\nThe picture of transmutation given in these verses, however severe\r\nand contemptuous the strictures lavishly bestowed on it by Christian\r\ncommentators, accords singularly with the train of thought which the\r\nmodern doctrine of progressive development has encouraged.\r\n\r\n\"When animals,\" he says, \"first crept forth from the newly formed earth,\r\na dumb and filthy herd, they fought for acorns and lurking-places with\r\ntheir nails and fists, then with clubs, and at last with arms, which,\r\ntaught by experience, they had forged. They then invented names for\r\nthings and words to express their thoughts, after which they began to\r\ndesist from war, to fortify cities and enact laws.\" They who in\r\nlater times have embraced a similar theory, have been led to it by no\r\ndeference to the opinions of their pagan predecessors, but rather in\r\nspite of very strong prepossessions in favour of an opposite hypothesis,\r\nnamely, that of the superiority of their original progenitors, of whom\r\nthey believe themselves to be the corrupt and degenerate descendants.\r\n\r\nSo far as they are guided by palaeontology, they arrive at this result\r\nby an independent course of reasoning; but they have been conducted\r\npartly to the same goal as the ancients by ethnological considerations\r\ncommon to both, or by reflecting in what darkness the infancy of\r\nevery nation is enveloped and that true history and chronology are the\r\ncreation, as it were, of yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20. -- THEORIES OF PROGRESSION AND TRANSMUTATION.\r\n\r\n  Antiquity and Persistence in Character of the existing Races\r\n     of Mankind.\r\n  Theory of their Unity of Origin considered.\r\n  Bearing of the Diversity of Races on the Doctrine of Transmutation.\r\n  Difficulty of defining the Terms \"Species\" and \"Race.\"\r\n  Lamarck's Introduction of the Element of Time into the\r\n     Definition of a Species.\r\n  His Theory of Variation and Progression.\r\n  Objections to his Theory, how far answered.\r\n  Arguments of modern Writers in favour of Progression in the\r\n     Animal and Vegetable World.\r\n  The old Landmarks supposed to indicate the first Appearance of Man,\r\n     and of different Classes of Animals, found to be erroneous.\r\n  Yet the Theory of an advancing Series of Organic Beings not\r\n     inconsistent with Facts.\r\n  Earliest known Fossil Mammalia of low Grade.\r\n  No Vertebrata as yet discovered in the oldest Fossiliferous Rocks.\r\n  Objections to the Theory of Progression considered.\r\n  Causes of the Popularity of the Doctrine of Progression as compared\r\n     to that of Transmutation.\r\n\r\nWhen speaking in a former work of the distinct races of mankind,* I\r\nremarked that, \"if all the leading varieties of the human family sprang\r\noriginally from a single pair\" (a doctrine, to which then, as now,\r\nI could see no valid objection), \"a much greater lapse of time was\r\nrequired for the slow and gradual formation of such races as the\r\nCaucasian, Mongolian, and Negro, than was embraced in any of the popular\r\nsystems of chronology.\"\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles of Geology\" 7th edition page 637, 1847; see\r\n     also 9th edition page 660.)\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of the high antiquity of two of these, I referred to\r\npictures on the walls of ancient temples in Egypt, in which, a thousand\r\nyears or more before the Christian era, \"the Negro and Caucasian\r\nphysiognomies were portrayed as faithfully, and in as strong contrast,\r\nas if the likenesses of these races had been taken yesterday.\" In\r\nrelation to the same subject, I dwelt on the slight modification which\r\nthe Negro has undergone, after having been transported from the tropics\r\nand settled for more than two centuries in the temperate climate of\r\nVirginia. I therefore concluded that, \"if the various races were\r\nall descended from a single pair, we must allow for a vast series of\r\nantecedent ages, in the course of which the long-continued influence\r\nof external circumstances gave rise to peculiarities increased in many\r\nsuccessive generations and at length fixed by hereditary transmission.\"\r\n\r\nSo long as physiologists continued to believe that Man had not existed\r\non the earth above six thousand years, they might with good reason\r\nwithhold their assent from the doctrine of a unity of origin of so many\r\ndistinct races but the difficulty becomes less and less, exactly in\r\nproportion as we enlarge our ideas of the lapse of time during which\r\ndifferent communities may have spread slowly, and become isolated,\r\neach exposed for ages to a peculiar set of conditions, whether of\r\ntemperature, or food, or danger, or ways of living. The law of the\r\ngeometrical rate of the increase of population which causes it always\r\nto press hard on the means of subsistence, would ensure the migration in\r\nvarious directions of offshoots from the society first formed abandoning\r\nthe area where they had multiplied. But when they had gradually\r\npenetrated to remote regions by land or water--drifted sometimes\r\nby storms and currents in canoes to an unknown shore--barriers of\r\nmountains, deserts, or seas, which oppose no obstacle to mutual\r\nintercourse between civilised nations, would ensure the complete\r\nisolation for tens or thousands of centuries of tribes in a primitive\r\nstate of barbarism.\r\n\r\nSome modern ethnologists, in accordance with the philosophers of\r\nantiquity, have assumed that men at first fed on the fruits of the\r\nearth, before even a stone implement or the simplest form of canoe had\r\nbeen invented. They may, it is said, have begun their career in some\r\nfertile island in the tropics, where the warmth of the air was such that\r\nno clothing was needed and where there were no wild beasts to endanger\r\ntheir safety. But as soon as their numbers increased they would be\r\nforced to migrate into regions less secure and blest with a less genial\r\nclimate. Contests would soon arise for the possession of the most\r\nfertile lands, where game or pasture abounded and their energies and\r\ninventive powers would be called forth, so that at length they would\r\nmake progress in the arts.\r\n\r\nBut as ethnologists have failed, as yet, to trace back the history\r\nof any one race to the area where it originated, some zoologists of\r\neminence have declared their belief that the different races, whether\r\nthey be three, five, twenty, or a much greater number (for on this point\r\nthere is an endless diversity of opinion),* have all been primordial\r\ncreations, having from the first been stamped with the characteristic\r\nfeatures, mental and bodily, by which they are now distinguished, except\r\nwhere intermarriage has given rise to mixed or hybrid races.\r\n\r\n     (* See \"Transactions of the Ethnological Society\" volume 1\r\n     1861.)\r\n\r\nWere we to admit, say they, a unity of origin of such strongly marked\r\nvarieties as the Negro and European, differing as they do in colour and\r\nbodily constitution, each fitted for distinct climates and exhibiting\r\nsome marked peculiarities in their osteological, and even in some\r\ndetails of cranial and cerebral conformation, as well as in their\r\naverage intellectual endowments--if, in spite of the fact that all these\r\nattributes have been faithfully handed down unaltered for hundreds of\r\ngenerations, we are to believe that, in the course of time, they have\r\nall diverged from one common stock, how shall we resist the arguments\r\nof the transmutationist, who contends that all closely allied species of\r\nanimals and plants have in like manner sprung from a common parentage,\r\nalbeit that for the last three or four thousand years they may have been\r\npersistent in character? Where are we to stop, unless we make our stand\r\nat once on the independent creation of those distinct human races, the\r\nhistory of which is better known to us than that of any of the inferior\r\nanimals?\r\n\r\nSo long as Geology had not lifted up a part of the veil which formerly\r\nconcealed from the naturalist the history of the changes which the\r\nanimate creation had undergone in times immediately antecedent to\r\nthe Recent period, it was easy to treat these questions as too\r\ntranscendental, or as lying too far beyond the domain of positive\r\nscience to require serious discussion. But it is no longer possible\r\nto restrain curiosity from attempting to pry into the relations which\r\nconnect the present state of the animal and vegetable worlds, as well as\r\nof the various races of mankind, with the state of the fauna and flora\r\nwhich immediately preceded.\r\n\r\nIn the very outset of the inquiry, we are met with the difficulty\r\nof defining what we mean by the terms \"species\" and \"race;\" and the\r\nsurprise of the unlearned is usually great, when they discover how wide\r\nis the difference of opinion now prevailing as to the significance of\r\nwords in such familiar use. But, in truth, we can come to no agreement\r\nas to such definitions, unless we have previously made up our minds\r\non some of the most momentous of all the enigmas with which the human\r\nintellect ever attempted to grapple.\r\n\r\nIt is now thirty years since I gave an analysis in the first edition of\r\nmy \"Principles of Geology\" (volume 2 1832) of the views which had been\r\nput forth by Lamarck, in the beginning of the century, on this subject.\r\nIn that interval the progress made in zoology and botany, both in\r\naugmenting the number of known animals and plants, and in studying their\r\nphysiology and geographical distribution and above all in examining and\r\ndescribing fossil species, is so vast that the additions made to our\r\nknowledge probably exceed all that was previously known; and what\r\nLamarck then foretold has come to pass; the more new forms have been\r\nmultiplied, the less are we able to decide what we mean by a variety,\r\nand what by a species. In fact, zoologists and botanists are not only\r\nmore at a loss than ever how to define a species, but even to determine\r\nwhether it has any real existence in nature, or is a mere abstraction of\r\nthe human intellect, some contending that it is constant within certain\r\nnarrow and impassable limits of variability, others that it is capable\r\nof indefinite and endless modification.\r\n\r\nBefore I attempt to explain a great step, which has recently been made\r\nby Mr. Darwin and his fellow-labourers in this field of inquiry, I think\r\nit useful to recapitulate in this place some of the leading features of\r\nLamarck's system, without attempting to adjust the claims of some of\r\nhis contemporaries (Geoffroy St. Hilaire in particular) to share in the\r\ncredit of some of his original speculations.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Linnaeus to the commencement of the present century,\r\nit seemed a sufficient definition of the term species to say that\r\n\"a species consisted of individuals all resembling each other, and\r\nreproducing their like by generation.\" But Lamarck after having\r\nfirst studied botany with success, had then turned his attention to\r\nconchology, and soon became aware that in the newer (or Tertiary) strata\r\nof the earth's crust there were a multitude of fossil species of shells,\r\nsome of them identical with living ones, others simply varieties of the\r\nliving, and which as such were entitled to be designated, according\r\nto the ordinary rules of classification, by the same names. He also\r\nobserved that other shells were so nearly allied to living forms that\r\nit was difficult not to suspect that they had been connected by a common\r\nbond of descent. He therefore proposed that the element of time should\r\nenter into the definition of a species, and that it should run thus:\r\n\"A species consists of individuals all resembling each other, and\r\nreproducing their like by generation, SO LONG AS THE SURROUNDING\r\nCONDITIONS DO NOT UNDERGO CHANGES SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE THEIR HABITS,\r\nCHARACTERS, AND FORMS TO VARY.\" He came at last to the conclusion that\r\nnone of the animals and plants now existing were primordial creations,\r\nbut were all derived from pre-existing forms, which, after they may have\r\ngone on for indefinite ages reproducing their like, had at length, by\r\nthe influence of alterations in climate and in the animate world been\r\nmade to vary gradually, and adapt themselves to new circumstances, some\r\nof them deviating in the course of ages so far from their original type\r\nas to have claims to be regarded as new species.\r\n\r\nIn support of these views, he referred to wild and cultivated plants and\r\nto wild and domesticated animals, pointing out how their colour, form,\r\nstructure, physiological attributes and even instincts were gradually\r\nmodified by exposure to new soils and climates, new enemies, modes of\r\nsubsistence, and kinds of food.\r\n\r\nNor did he omit to notice that the newly acquired peculiarities may\r\nbe inherited by the offspring for an indefinite series of generations,\r\nwhether they be brought about naturally--as when a species, on the\r\nextreme verge of its geographical range, comes into competition with\r\nnew antagonists and is subjected to new physical conditions; or\r\nartificially--as when by the act of the breeder or horticulturist\r\npeculiar varieties of form or disposition are selected.\r\n\r\nBut Lamarck taught not only that species had been constantly undergoing\r\nchanges from one geological period to another, but that there also had\r\nbeen a progressive advance of the organic world from the earliest to\r\nthe latest times, from beings of the simplest to those of more and more\r\ncomplex structure, and from the lowest instincts up to the highest,\r\nand finally from brute intelligence to the reasoning powers of Man. The\r\nimprovement in the grade of being had been slow and continuous, and the\r\nhuman race itself was at length evolved out of the most highly organised\r\nand endowed of the inferior mammalia.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain how, after an indefinite lapse of ages, so many of\r\nthe lowest grades of animal or plant still abounded, he imagined that\r\nthe germs or rudiments of living things, which he called monads, were\r\ncontinually coming into the world and that there were different kinds\r\nof these monads for each primary division of the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms. This last hypothesis does not seem essentially different from\r\nthe old doctrine of equivocal or spontaneous generation; it is wholly\r\nunsupported by any modern experiments or observation, and therefore\r\naffords us no aid whatever in speculating on the commencement of vital\r\nphenomena on the earth.\r\n\r\nSome of the laws which govern the appearance of new varieties were\r\nclearly pointed out by Lamarck. He remarked, for example, that as the\r\nmuscles of the arm become strengthened by exercise or enfeebled by\r\ndisuse, some organs may in this way, in the course of time, become\r\nentirely obsolete, and others previously weak become strong and play a\r\nnew or more leading part in the organisation of a species. And so\r\nwith instincts, where animals experience new dangers they become more\r\ncautious and cunning, and transmit these acquired faculties to their\r\nposterity. But not satisfied with such legitimate speculations, the\r\nFrench philosopher conceived that by repeated acts of volition animals\r\nmight acquire new organs and attributes, and that in plants, which\r\ncould not exert a will of their own, certain subtle fluids or organising\r\nforces might operate so as to work out analogous effects.\r\n\r\nAfter commenting on these purely imaginary causes, I pointed out in\r\n1832, as the two great flaws in Lamarck's attempt to explain the origin\r\nof species, first, that he had failed to adduce a single instance of\r\nthe initiation of a new organ in any species of animal or plant; and\r\nsecondly, that variation, whether taking place in the course of nature\r\nor assisted artificially by the breeder and horticulturist, had never\r\nyet gone so far as to produce two races sufficiently remote from each\r\nother in physiological constitution as to be sterile when intermarried,\r\nor, if fertile, only capable of producing sterile hybrids, etc.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles of Geology\" 1st edition volume 2 chapter 2.)\r\n\r\nTo this objection Lamarck would, no doubt, have answered that there had\r\nnot been time for bringing about so great an amount of variation;\r\nfor when Cuvier and some other of his contemporaries appealed to the\r\nembalmed animals and plants taken from Egyptian tombs, some of them 3000\r\nyears old, which had not experienced in that long period the slightest\r\nmodification in their specific characters, he replied that the climate\r\nand soil of the valley of the Nile had not varied in the interval, and\r\nthat there was therefore no reason for expecting that we should be able\r\nto detect any change in the fauna and flora. \"But if,\" he went on to\r\nsay, \"the physical geography, temperature, and other conditions of life\r\nhad been altered in Egypt as much as we know from geology has happened\r\nin other regions, some of the same animals and plants would have\r\ndeviated so far from their pristine types as to be thought entitled to\r\ntake rank as new and distinct species.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough I cited this answer of Lamarck in my account of his theory,*\r\nI did not at the time fully appreciate the deep conviction which it\r\ndisplays of the slow manner in which geological changes have taken place\r\nand the insignificance of thirty or forty centuries in the history of\r\na species, and that, too, at a period when very narrow views were\r\nentertained of the extent of past time by most of the ablest geologists,\r\nand when great revolutions of the earth's crust, and its inhabitants,\r\nwere generally attributed to sudden and violent catastrophes.\r\n\r\n    (* Ibid. page 587.)\r\n\r\nWhile in 1832 I argued against Lamarck's doctrine of the gradual\r\ntransmutation of one species into another, I agreed with him in\r\nbelieving that the system of changes now in progress in the organic\r\nworld would afford, when fully understood, a complete key to the\r\ninterpretation of all the vicissitudes of the living creation in past\r\nages. I contended against the doctrine, then very popular, of the sudden\r\ndestruction of vast multitudes of species and the abrupt ushering into\r\nthe world of new batches of plants and animals.\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to sketch out (and it was, I believe, the first systematic\r\nattempt to accomplish such a task) the laws which govern the extinction\r\nof species, with a view of showing that the slow but ceaseless\r\nvariations now in progress in physical geography, together with the\r\nmigration of plants and animals into new regions, must in the course\r\nof ages give rise to the occasional loss of some of them and eventually\r\ncause an entire fauna and flora to die out; also that we must infer from\r\ngeological data that the places thus left vacant from time to time\r\nare filled up without delay by new forms adapted to new conditions,\r\nsometimes by immigration from adjoining provinces, sometimes by new\r\ncreations. Among the many causes of extinction enumerated by me were the\r\npower of hostile species, diminution of food, mutations in climate, the\r\nconversion of land into sea and of sea into land, etc. I firmly opposed\r\nBrocchi's hypothesis of a decline in the vital energy of each species;*\r\nmaintaining that there was every reason to believe that the reproductive\r\npowers of the last surviving representatives of a species were as\r\nvigorous as those of their predecessors, and that they were as capable,\r\nunder favourable circumstances, of repeopling the earth with their kind.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles of Geology\" 1st edition volume 2 chapter 8;\r\n     and 9th edition page 668.)\r\n\r\nThe manner in which some species are now becoming scarce and dying out,\r\none after the other, appeared to me to favour the doctrine of the fixity\r\nof the specific character, showing a want of pliancy and capability of\r\nvarying, which ensured their annihilation whenever changes adverse\r\nto their well-being occurred; time not being allowed for such a\r\ntransformation as might be conceived capable of adapting them to the new\r\ncircumstances, and of converting them into what naturalists would call\r\nnew species.*\r\n\r\n     (* Laws of Extinction, \"Principles of Geology\" 1st edition\r\n     1832 volume 2 chapters 5 to 11 inclusive; and 9th edition\r\n     chapters 37 to 42 inclusive 1853.)\r\n\r\nBut while rejecting transmutation, I was equally opposed to the popular\r\ntheory that the creative power had diminished in energy, or that it\r\nhad been in abeyance ever since Man had entered upon the scene. That a\r\nrenovating force which had been in full operation for millions of years\r\nshould cease to act while the causes of extinction were still in full\r\nactivity, or even intensified by the accession of Man's destroying\r\npower, seemed to me in the highest degree improbable. The only point on\r\nwhich I doubted was whether the force might not be intermittent instead\r\nof being, as Lamarck supposed, in ceaseless operation. Might not the\r\nbirths of new species, like the deaths of old ones, be sudden? Might\r\nthey not still escape our observation? If the coming in of one new\r\nspecies, and the loss of one other which had endured for ages, should\r\ntake place annually, still, assuming that there are a million of animals\r\nand plants living on the globe, it would require, I observed, a million\r\nof years to bring about a complete revolution in the fauna and flora. In\r\nthat case, I imagined that, although the first appearance of a new form\r\nmight be as abrupt as the disappearance of an old one, yet naturalists\r\nmight never yet have witnessed the first entrance on the stage of a\r\nlarge and conspicuous animal or plant, and as to the smaller kinds, many\r\nof them may be conceived to have stolen in unseen, and to have spread\r\ngradually over a wide area, like species migrating into new provinces.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles of Geology\" 1st edition 1832 volume 2 chapter\r\n     11; and 9th edition page 706.)\r\n\r\nIt may now be useful to offer some remarks on the very different\r\nreception which the twin branches of Lamarck's development theory,\r\nnamely, progression and transmutation, have met with, and to inquire\r\ninto the causes of the popularity of the one and the great unpopularity\r\nof the other. We usually test the value of a scientific hypothesis by\r\nthe number and variety of the phenomena of which it offers a fair or\r\nplausible explanation. If transmutation, when thus tested, has decidedly\r\nthe advantage over progression and yet is comparatively in disfavour,\r\nwe may reasonably suspect that its reception is retarded, not so much by\r\nits own inherent demerits, as by some apprehended consequences which\r\nit is supposed to involve and which run counter to our preconceived\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF PROGRESSION.\r\n\r\nIn treating of this question, I shall begin with the doctrine of\r\nprogression, a concise statement of which, so far as it relates to the\r\nanimal kingdom, was thus given twelve years ago by Professor Sedgwick,\r\nin the preface to his \"Discourse on the Studies of the University of\r\nCambridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are traces,\" he says, \"among the old deposits of the earth of an\r\norganic progression among the successive forms of life. They are to\r\nbe seen in the absence of mammalia in the older, and their very\r\nrare appearance in the newer Secondary groups; in the diffusion of\r\nwarm-blooded quadrupeds (frequently of unknown genera) in the older\r\nTertiary system, and in their great abundance (and frequently of known\r\ngenera) in the upper portions of the same series; and lastly, in the\r\nrecent appearance of Man on the surface of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"This historical development,\" continues the same author, of the forms\r\nand functions of organic life during successive epochs, \"seems to mark\r\na gradual evolution of creative power, manifested by a gradual ascent\r\ntowards a higher type of being.\" \"But the elevation of the fauna of\r\nsuccessive periods was not made by transmutation, but by creative\r\nadditions; and it is by watching these additions that we get some\r\ninsight into Nature's true historical progress, and learn that there\r\nwas a time when Cephalopoda were the highest types of animal life, the\r\nprimates of this world; that Fishes next took the lead, then Reptiles;\r\nand that during the secondary period they were anatomically raised far\r\nabove any forms of the reptile class now living in the world. Mammals\r\nwere added next, until Nature became what she now is, by the addition of\r\nMan.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Professor Sedgwick's \"Discourse on the Studies of the\r\n     University of Cambridge\" Preface to 5th edition pages 44,\r\n     154, 216, 1850.)\r\n\r\nAlthough in the half century which has elapsed between the time of\r\nLamarck and the publication of the above summary, new discoveries have\r\ncaused geologists to assign a higher antiquity both to Man and the\r\noldest fossil mammalia, fish, and reptiles than formerly, yet the\r\ngeneralisation, as laid down by the Woodwardian Professor, as to\r\nprogression, still holds good in all essential particulars.\r\n\r\nThe progressive theory was propounded in the following terms by the late\r\nHugh Miller in his \"Footprints of the Creator.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is of itself an extraordinary fact without reference to other\r\nconsiderations, that the order adopted by Cuvier in his \"Animal\r\nKingdom,\" as that in which the four great classes of vertebrate animals,\r\nwhen marshalled according to their rank and standing, naturally range,\r\nshould be also that in which they occur in order of time. The brain,\r\nwhich bears an average proportion to the spinal cord of not more than\r\ntwo to one, comes first--it is the brain of the fish; that which bears\r\nto the spinal cord an average proportion of two and a half to one\r\nsucceeded it--it is the brain of the reptile; then came the brain\r\naveraging as three to one--it is that of the bird. Next in succession\r\ncame the brain that averages as four to one--it is that of the mammal;\r\nand last of all there appeared a brain that averages as twenty-three to\r\none--reasoning, calculating Man had come upon the scene.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Footprints of the Creator\" Edinburgh 1849 page 283.)\r\n\r\nM. Agassiz, in his \"Essay on Classification,\" has devoted a chapter to\r\nthe \"Parallelism between the Geological Succession of Animals and\r\nPlants and their present relative Standing;\" in which he has expressed a\r\ndecided opinion that within the limits of the orders of each great class\r\nthere is a coincidence between their relative rank in organisation and\r\nthe order of succession of their representatives in time.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Contributions to the Natural History of the United\r\n     States\" Part 1.--Essay on Classification page 108.)\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen, in his Palaeontology, has advanced similar views, and\r\nhas remarked, in regard to the vertebrata that there is much positive\r\nas well as negative evidence in support of the doctrine of an advance in\r\nthe scale of being, from ancient to more modern geological periods. We\r\nobserve, for example, in the Triassic, Oolitic, and Cretaceous\r\nstrata, not only an absence of placental mammalia, but the presence\r\nof innumerable reptiles, some of large size, terrestrial and aquatic,\r\nherbivorous and predaceous, fitted to perform the functions now\r\ndischarged by the mammalia.\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Bronn, of Heidelberg, after passing in review more\r\nthan 24,000 fossil animals and plants, which he had classified\r\nand referred each to their geological position in his \"Index\r\nPalaeontologicus,\" came to the conclusion that, in the course of time,\r\nthere had been introduced into the earth more and more highly organised\r\ntypes of animal and vegetable life; the modern species being, on the\r\nwhole, more specialised, i.e. having separate organs, or parts of the\r\nbody, to perform different functions, which, in the earlier periods and\r\nin beings of simpler structure, were discharged in common by a single\r\npart or organ.\r\n\r\nProfessor Adolphe Brongniart, in an essay published in 1849 on the\r\nbotanical classification and geological distribution of the genera of\r\nfossil plants,* arrives at similar results as to the progress of the\r\nvegetable world from the earliest periods to the present.\r\n\r\n     (* Tableau des Genres de Vegetaux fossiles, etc.\r\n     \"Dictionnaire Universel d'Histoire Naturelle\" Paris 1849.)\r\n\r\nHe does not pretend to trace an exact historical series from the\r\nsea-weed to the fern, or from the fern again to the conifers and\r\ncycads, and lastly from those families to the palms and oaks, but he,\r\nnevertheless, points out that the cryptogamic forms, especially the\r\nacrogens, predominate among the fossils of the primary formations,\r\nthe Carboniferous especially, while the gymnosperms or coniferous and\r\ncycadeous plants abound in all the strata, from the Trias to the Wealden\r\ninclusive; and lastly, the more highly developed angiosperms, both\r\nmonocotyledonous and dicotyledonous, do not become abundant until the\r\nTertiary period. It is a remarkable fact, as he justly observes,\r\nthat the angiospermous exogens, which comprise four-fifths of living\r\nplants--a division to which all our native European trees, except the\r\nConiferae, belong, and which embrace all the Compositae, Leguminosae,\r\nUmbelliferae, Cruciferae, Heaths, and so many other families--are wholly\r\nunrepresented by any fossils hitherto discovered in the Primary and\r\nSecondary formations from the Silurian to the Oolitic inclusive. It is\r\nnot till we arrive at the Cretaceous period that they begin to appear,\r\nsparingly at first, and only playing a conspicuous part, together with\r\nthe palms and other endogens, in the Tertiary epoch.\r\n\r\nWhen commenting on the eagerness with which the doctrine of progression\r\nwas embraced from the close of the last century to the time when I first\r\nattempted, in 1830, to give some account of the prevailing theories in\r\ngeology, I observed that far too much reliance was commonly placed on\r\nthe received dates of the first appearances of certain orders or classes\r\nof animals or plants, such dates being determined by the age of the\r\nstratum in which we then happened to have discovered the earliest\r\nmemorials of such types. At that time (1830), it was taken for granted\r\nthat Man had not co-existed with the mammoth and other extinct mammalia,\r\nyet now that we have traced back the signs of his existence to the\r\nPleistocene era, and may anticipate the finding of his remains on some\r\nfuture day in the Pliocene period, the theory of progression is not\r\nshaken; for we cannot expect to meet with human bones in the Miocene\r\nformations, where all the species and nearly all the genera of mammalia\r\nbelong to types widely differing from those now living; and had some\r\nother rational being, representing Man, then flourished, some signs\r\nof his existence could hardly have escaped unnoticed, in the shape of\r\nimplements of stone or metal, more frequent and more durable than the\r\nosseous remains of any of the mammalia.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this century it was one of the canons of the popular\r\ngeological creed that the first warm-blooded quadrupeds which had\r\ninhabited this planet were those derived from the Eocene gypsum of\r\nMontmartre in the suburbs of Paris, almost all of which Cuvier had shown\r\nto belong to extinct genera. This dogma continued in force for more than\r\na quarter of a century, in spite of the discovery in 1818 of a marsupial\r\nquadruped in the Stonesfield strata, a member of the Lower Oolite,\r\nnear Oxford. Some disputed the authority of Cuvier himself as to the\r\nmammalian character of the fossil; others, the accuracy of those who had\r\nassigned to it so ancient a place in the chronological series of rocks.\r\nIn 1832 I pointed out that the occurrence of this single fossil in\r\nthe Oolite was \"fatal to the theory of successive development\" as then\r\npropounded.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Principles of Geology\" 2nd edition 1 173.)\r\n\r\nSince that period great additions have been made to our knowledge of\r\nthe existence of land quadrupeds in the olden times. We have ascertained\r\nthat, in Eocene strata older than the gypsum of Paris, no less than\r\nfour distinct sets of placental mammalia have flourished; namely, first,\r\nthose of the Headon series in the Isle of Wight, from which fourteen\r\nspecies have been procured; secondly, those of the antecedent\r\nBagshot and Bracklesham beds, which have yielded, together with the\r\ncontemporaneous \"calcaire grossier\" of Paris, twenty species; thirdly,\r\nthe still older beds of Kyson, near Ipswich, and those of Herne Bay,\r\nat the mouth of the Thames, in which seven species have been found;\r\nand fourthly, the Woolwich and Reading beds, which have supplied ten\r\nspecies.*\r\n\r\n     (* Lyell's supplement to 5th edition of \"Elements\" 1857.)\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely doubt that we should already have traced back the\r\nevidence of this class of fossils much farther had not our inquiries\r\nbeen arrested, first by the vast gap between the Tertiary and Secondary\r\nformations, and then by the marine nature of the Cretaceous rocks.\r\n\r\nThe mammalia next in antiquity, of which we have any cognisance, are\r\nthose of the Upper Oolite of Purbeck, discovered between the years 1854\r\nand 1857, and comprising no less than fourteen species, referable\r\nto eight or nine genera; one of them, Plagiaulax, considered by Dr.\r\nFalconer to have been a herbivorous marsupial. The whole assemblage\r\nappear, from the joint observations of Professor Owen and Dr. Falconer,\r\nto indicate a low grade of quadruped, probably of the marsupial type.\r\nThey were, for the most part, diminutive, the two largest not much\r\nexceeding our common hedgehog and polecat in size.\r\n\r\nNext anterior in age are the mammalia of the Lower Oolite of\r\nStonesfield, of which four species are known, also very small and\r\nprobably marsupial, with one exception, the Stereognathus ooliticus,\r\nwhich, according to Professor Owen's conjecture, may have been a hoofed\r\nquadruped and placental, though, as we have only half of the lower jaw\r\nwith teeth, and the molars are unlike any living type, such an opinion\r\nis of course hazarded with due caution.\r\n\r\nStill older than the above are some fossil quadrupeds of small size,\r\nfound in the Upper Trias of Stuttgart in Germany, and more lately by Mr.\r\nC. Moore in beds of corresponding age near Frome, which are also of a\r\nvery low grade, like the living Myrmecobius of Australia. Beyond this\r\nlimit our knowledge of the highest class of vertebrata does not as\r\nyet extend into the past, but the frequent shifting back of the old\r\nlandmarks, nearly all of them once supposed in their turn to indicate\r\nthe date of the first appearance of warm-blooded quadrupeds on this\r\nplanet, should serve as a warning to us not to consider the goal at\r\npresent reached by palaeontology as one beyond which they who come after\r\nus are never destined to pass.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it may be truly said in favour of progression that\r\nafter all these discoveries the doctrine is not gainsaid, for the less\r\nadvanced marsupials precede the more perfect placental mammalia in the\r\norder of their appearance on the earth.\r\n\r\nIf the three localities where the most ancient mammalia have been\r\nfound--Purbeck, Stonesfield, and Stuttgart--had belonged all of them to\r\nformations of the same age, we might well have imagined so limited an\r\narea to have been peopled exclusively with pouched quadrupeds, just\r\nas Australia now is, while other parts of the globe were inhabited by\r\nplacentals, for Australia now supports one hundred and sixty species of\r\nmarsupials, while the rest of the continents and islands are tenanted by\r\nabout seventeen hundred species of mammalia, of which only forty-six\r\nare marsupial, namely, the opossums of North and South America. But the\r\ngreat difference of age of the strata in each of these three localities\r\nseems to indicate the predominance throughout a vast lapse of time (from\r\nthe era of the Upper Trias to that of the Purbeck beds) of a low grade\r\nof quadrupeds; and this persistency of similar generic and ordinal types\r\nin Europe while the species were changing, and while the fish, reptiles,\r\nand mollusca were undergoing vast modifications, raises a strong\r\npresumption that there was also a vast extension in space of the same\r\nmarsupial forms during that portion of the Secondary epoch which has\r\nbeen termed \"the age of reptiles.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the class Reptilia, some of the orders which prevailed when\r\nthe Secondary rocks were formed are confessedly much higher in their\r\norganisation than any of the same class now living. If the less perfect\r\nophidians, or snakes, which now abound on the earth had taken the lead\r\nin those ancient days among the land reptiles, and the Deinosaurians\r\nhad been contemporary with Man, there can be no doubt that the\r\nprogressionist would have seized upon this fact with unfeigned\r\nsatisfaction as confirmatory of his views. Now that the order of\r\nsuccession is precisely reversed, and that the age of the Iguanodon was\r\nlong anterior to that of the Eocene Palaeophis and living boa, while the\r\ncrocodile is in our own times the highest representative of its class, a\r\nretrograde movement in this important division of the vertebrata must be\r\nadmitted. It may perhaps be accounted for by the power acquired by the\r\nplacental mammalia, when they became dominant, a power before which\r\nthe class of vertebrata next below them, as coming most directly in\r\ncompetition with them, may more than any other have given way.\r\n\r\nFor no less than thirty-four years it had been a received axiom in\r\npalaeontology that reptiles had never existed before the Permian or\r\nMagnesian Limestone period, when at length in 1844 this supposed barrier\r\nwas thrown down, and Carboniferous reptiles, terrestrial and aquatic, of\r\nseveral genera were brought to light; and discussions are now going\r\non as to whether some remains of an Enaliosaur (perhaps a large\r\nLabyrinthodon) have not been detected in the coal of Nova Scotia, and\r\nwhether certain sandstones near Elgin in Scotland, containing the bones\r\nof lacertian, crocodilian, and rhynchosaurian reptiles, may not be\r\nreferable to the \"Old Red\" or Devonian group. Still, no traces of this\r\nclass have yet been detected in rocks as ancient as those in which the\r\noldest fish have been found. [38]\r\n\r\nAs to fossil representatives of the ichthyic type, the most ancient were\r\nnot supposed before 1838 to be of a date anterior to the Coal, but they\r\nhave since been traced back, first to the Devonian, and then to the\r\nSilurian rocks. No remains, however, of them or of any vertebrate animal\r\nhave yet been discovered in the Ordovician strata, rich as these are in\r\ninvertebrate fossils, nor in the still older Cambrian; so that we seem\r\nauthorised to conclude, though not without considerable reserve, that\r\nthe vertebrate type was extremely scarce, if not wholly wanting,\r\nin those epochs often spoken of as \"primitive,\" but which, if the\r\nDevelopment Theory be true, were probably the last of a long series of\r\nantecedent ages in which living beings flourished.\r\n\r\nAs to the Mollusca, which afford the most unbroken series of geological\r\nmedals, the highest of that class, the Cephalopoda, abounded in\r\nolder Silurian times, comprising several hundred species of chambered\r\nunivalves. Had there been strong prepossessions against the progressive\r\ntheory, it would probably have been argued that when these cephalopods\r\nabounded, and the siphonated gasteropods were absent, a higher order of\r\nzoophagous mollusca discharged the functions afterwards performed by an\r\ninferior order in the Secondary, Tertiary, and Post-Tertiary seas. But\r\nI have never seen this view suggested as adverse to the doctrine of\r\nprogress, although much stress has been laid on the fact that the\r\nSilurian Brachiopoda, creatures of a lower grade, formerly discharged\r\nthe functions of the existing lamellibranchiate bivalves, which are\r\nhigher in the scale.\r\n\r\nIt is said truly that the Ammonite, Orthoceras, and Nautilus of these\r\nancient rocks were of the tetrabranchiate division, and none of them\r\nso highly organised as the Belemnite and other dibranchiate cephalopods\r\nwhich afterwards appeared, and some of which now flourish in our seas.\r\nTherefore, we may infer that the simplest forms of the Cephalopoda took\r\nprecedence of the more complex in time. But if we embrace this view, we\r\nmust not forget that there are living Cephalopoda, such as the Octopods,\r\nwhich are devoid of any hard parts, whether external or internal, and\r\nwhich could leave behind them no fossil memorials of their existence,\r\nso that we must make a somewhat arbitrary assumption, namely, that at\r\na remote era, no such Dibranchiata were in being, in order to avail\r\nourselves of this argument in favour of progression. On the other\r\nhand, it is true that in the Lower Cambrian not even the shell-bearing\r\ntetrabranchiates have yet been discovered.\r\n\r\nIn regard to plants, although the generalisation above cited of M.\r\nAdolphe Brongniart is probably true, there has been a tendency in the\r\nadvocates of progression to push the inferences deducible from known\r\nfacts, in support of their favourite dogma, somewhat beyond the limits\r\nwhich the evidence justifies. Dr. Hooker observes, in his recent\r\n\"Introductory Essay to the Flora of Australia,\" that it is impossible\r\nto establish a parallel between the successive appearances of vegetable\r\nforms in time, and their complexity of structure or specialisation of\r\norgans as represented by the successively higher groups in the natural\r\nmethod of classification. He also adds that the earliest recognisable\r\nCryptogams are not only the highest now existing, but have more highly\r\ndifferentiated vegetative organs than any subsequently appearing, and\r\nthat the dicotyledonous embryo and perfect exogenous wood, with the\r\nhighest specialised tissue known (the coniferous with glandular tissue),\r\npreceded the monocotyledonous embryo and endogenous wood in date\r\nof appearance on the globe--facts wholly opposed to the doctrine of\r\nprogression, and which can only be set aside on the supposition that\r\nthey are fragmentary evidence of a time farther removed from the origin\r\nof vegetation than from the present day.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Introductory Essay to the Flora of Australia,\" page 31\r\n     London 1859. Published separately.) [39]\r\n\r\nIt would be an easy task to multiply objections to the theory now under\r\nconsideration; but from this I refrain, as I regard it not only as a\r\nuseful, but rather in the present state of science as an indispensable\r\nhypothesis, and one which though destined hereafter to undergo many and\r\ngreat modifications will never be overthrown.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought almost paradoxical that writers who are most in favour\r\nof transmutation (Mr. C. Darwin and Dr. J. Hooker, for example) are\r\nnevertheless among those who are most cautious, and one would say timid,\r\nin their mode of espousing the doctrine of progression; while, on the\r\nother hand, the most zealous advocates of progression are oftener than\r\nnot very vehement opponents of transmutation. We might have anticipated\r\na contrary leaning on the part of both, for to what does the theory\r\nof progression point? It supposes a gradual elevation in grade of the\r\nvertebrate type in the course of ages from the most simple ichthyic form\r\nto that of the placental mammalia and the coming upon the stage last in\r\nthe order of time of the most anthropomorphous mammalia, followed by\r\nthe human race--this last thus appearing as an integral part of the same\r\ncontinuous series of acts of development, one link in the same chain,\r\nthe crowning operation as it were of one and the same series of\r\nmanifestations of creative power. If the dangers apprehended from\r\ntransmutation arise from the too intimate connection which it tends to\r\nestablish between the human and merely animal natures, it might\r\nhave been expected that the progressive development of organisation,\r\ninstinct, and intelligence might have been unpopular, as likely to\r\npioneer the way for the reception of the less favoured doctrine. But the\r\ntrue explanation of the seeming anomaly is this, that no one can believe\r\nin transmutation who is not profoundly convinced that all we know in\r\npalaeontology is as nothing compared with what we have yet to learn, and\r\nthey who regard the record as so fragmentary, and our acquaintance\r\nwith the fragments which are extant as so rudimentary, are apt to be\r\nastounded at the confidence placed by the progressionists in data which\r\nmust be defective in the extreme. But exactly in proportion as the\r\ncompleteness of the record and our knowledge of it are overrated,\r\nin that same degree are many progressionists unconscious of the goal\r\ntowards which they are drifting. Their faith in the fullness of\r\nthe annals leads them to regard all breaks in the series of organic\r\nexistence, or in the sequence of the fossiliferous rocks, as proofs\r\nof original chasms and leaps in the course of nature--signs of the\r\nintermittent action of the creational force, or of catastrophes which\r\ndevastated the habitable surface. They do not doubt that there is a\r\ncontinuity of plan, but they believe that it exists in the Divine mind\r\nalone, and they are therefore without apprehension that any facts\r\nwill be discovered which would imply a material connection between the\r\noutgoing organisms and the incoming ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21. -- ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES BY VARIATION AND NATURAL\r\nSELECTION.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Darwin's Theory of the Origin of Species by Natural Selection.\r\n  Memoir by Mr. Wallace.\r\n  Manner in which favoured Races prevail in the Struggle for Existence.\r\n  Formation of new Races by breeding.\r\n  Hypotheses of definite and indefinite Modifiability equally arbitrary.\r\n  Competition and Extinction of Races.\r\n  Progression not a necessary Accompaniment of Variation.\r\n  Distinct Classes of Phenomena which Natural Selection explains.\r\n  Unity of Type, Rudimentary Organs, Geographical Distribution,\r\n     Relation of the extinct to the living Fauna and Flora, and\r\n     mutual Relations of successive Groups of Fossil Forms.\r\n  Light thrown on Embryological Development by Natural Selection.\r\n  Why large Genera have more variable Species than small ones.\r\n  Dr. Hooker on the Evidence afforded by the Vegetable Kingdom\r\n     in favour of Creation by Variation.\r\n  Steenstrup on alternation of Generations.\r\n  How far the Doctrine of Independent Creation is opposed to the\r\n     Laws now governing the Migration of Species.\r\n\r\nFor many years after the promulgation of Lamarck's doctrine of\r\nprogressive development, geologists were much occupied with the question\r\nwhether the past changes in the animate and inanimate world were brought\r\nabout by sudden and paroxysmal action, or gradually and continuously, by\r\ncauses differing neither in kind nor degree from those now in operation.\r\n\r\nThe anonymous author of \"The Vestiges of Creation\" published in 1844\r\na treatise, written in a clear and attractive style, which made\r\nthe English public familiar with the leading views of Lamarck on\r\ntransmutation and progression, but brought no new facts or original\r\nline of argument to support those views, or to combat the principal\r\nobjections which the scientific world entertained against them.\r\n\r\nNo decided step in this direction was made until the publication in 1858\r\nof two papers, one by Mr. Darwin and another by Mr. Wallace, followed in\r\n1859 by Mr. Darwin's celebrated work on \"The Origin of Species by Means\r\nof Natural Selection; or, the Preservation of favoured Races in the\r\nStruggle for Life.\" The author of this treatise had for twenty previous\r\nyears strongly inclined to believe that variation and the ordinary laws\r\nof reproduction were among the secondary causes always employed by the\r\nAuthor of nature, in the introduction from time to time of new species\r\ninto the world, and he had devoted himself patiently to the collecting\r\nof facts and making of experiments in zoology and botany, with a view\r\nof testing the soundness of the theory of transmutation. Part of the\r\nmanuscript of his projected work was read to Dr. Hooker as early as 1844\r\nand some of the principal results were communicated to me on several\r\noccasions. [40] Dr. Hooker and I had repeatedly urged him to publish\r\nwithout delay, but in vain, as he was always unwilling to interrupt the\r\ncourse of his investigations; until at length Mr. Alfred R. Wallace, who\r\nhad been engaged for years in collecting and studying the animals of the\r\nEast Indian archipelago, thought out independently for himself one of\r\nthe most novel and important of Mr. Darwin's theories. This he embodied\r\nin an essay \"On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely from\r\nthe original Type.\" It was written at Ternate in February 1858, and sent\r\nto Mr. Darwin with a request that it might be shown to me if thought\r\nsufficiently novel and interesting. Dr. Hooker and I were of opinion\r\nthat it should be immediately printed, and we succeeded in persuading\r\nMr. Darwin to allow one of the manuscript chapters of his \"Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" entitled \"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties, and\r\non the Perpetuation of Species and Varieties by natural Means of\r\nSelection,\" to appear at the same time.*\r\n\r\n     (* See \"Proceedings of the Linnaean Society\" 1858.)\r\n\r\nBy reference to these memoirs it will be seen that both writers begin by\r\napplying to the animal and vegetable worlds the Malthusian doctrine of\r\npopulation, or its tendency to increase in a geometrical ratio, while\r\nfood can only be made to augment even locally in an arithmetical one.\r\nThere being therefore no room or means of subsistence for a large\r\nproportion of the plants and animals which are born into the world, a\r\ngreat number must annually perish. Hence there is a constant struggle\r\nfor existence among the individuals which represent each species and\r\nthe vast majority can never reach the adult state, to say nothing of\r\nthe multitudes of ova and seeds which are never hatched or allowed to\r\ngerminate. Of birds it is estimated that the number of those which die\r\nevery year equals the aggregate number by which the species to which\r\nthey respectively belong is on the average permanently represented.\r\n\r\nThe trial of strength which must decide what individuals are to survive\r\nand what to succumb occurs in the season when the means of subsistence\r\nare fewest, or enemies most numerous, or when the individuals are\r\nenfeebled by climate or other causes; and it is then that those\r\nvarieties which have any, even the slightest, advantage over others come\r\noff victorious. They may often owe their safety to what would seem to a\r\ncasual observer a trifling difference, such as a darker or lighter shade\r\nof colour rendering them less visible to a species which preys upon\r\nthem, or sometimes to attributes more obviously advantageous, such as\r\ngreater cunning or superior powers of flight or swiftness of foot. These\r\npeculiar qualities and faculties, bodily and instinctive, may enable\r\nthem to outlive their less favoured rivals, and being transmitted by the\r\nforce of inheritance to their offspring will constitute new races, or\r\nwhat Mr. Darwin calls \"incipient species.\" If one variety, being\r\nin other respects just equal to its competitors, happens to be more\r\nprolific, some of its offspring will stand a greater chance of being\r\namong those which will escape destruction, and their descendants, being\r\nin like manner very fertile, will continue to multiply at the expense of\r\nall less prolific varieties.\r\n\r\nAs breeders of domestic animals, when they choose certain varieties in\r\npreference to others to breed from, speak technically of their method as\r\nthat of \"selecting,\" Mr. Darwin calls the combination of natural causes,\r\nwhich may enable certain varieties of wild animals or plants to prevail\r\nover others of the same species, \"natural selection.\"\r\n\r\nA breeder finds that a new race of cattle with short horns or without\r\nhorns may be formed in the course of several generations by choosing\r\nvarieties having the most stunted horns as his stock from which to\r\nbreed; so nature, by altering in the course of ages, the conditions\r\nof life, the geographical features of a country, its climate, the\r\nassociated plants and animals, and consequently the food and enemies\r\nof a species and its mode of life, may be said, by this means to select\r\ncertain varieties best adapted for the new state of things. Such\r\nnew races may often supplant the original type from which they\r\nhave diverged, although that type may have been perpetuated without\r\nmodification for countless anterior ages in the same region, so long as\r\nit was in harmony with the surrounding conditions then prevailing.\r\n\r\nLamarck, when speculating on the origin of the long neck of the giraffe,\r\nimagined that quadruped to have stretched himself up in order to reach\r\nthe boughs of lofty trees, until by continued efforts and longing to\r\nreach higher he obtained an elongated neck. Mr. Darwin and Mr. Wallace\r\nsimply suppose that, in a season of scarcity, a longer-necked variety,\r\nhaving the advantage in this respect over most of the herd, as being\r\nable to browse on foliage out of their reach, survived them and\r\ntransmitted its peculiarity of cervical conformation to its successors.\r\n\r\nBy the multiplying of slight modifications in the course of thousands of\r\ngenerations and by the handing down of the newly-acquired peculiarities\r\nby inheritance, a greater and greater divergence from the original\r\nstandard is supposed to be effected, until what may be called a new\r\nspecies, or in a greater lapse of time a new genus will be the result.\r\n\r\nEvery naturalist admits that there is a general tendency in animals and\r\nplants to vary; but it is usually taken for granted, though he have\r\nno means of proving the assumption to be true, that there are certain\r\nlimits beyond which each species cannot pass under any circumstances or\r\nin any number of generations. Mr. Darwin and Mr. Wallace say that the\r\nopposite hypothesis, which assumes that every species is capable\r\nof varying indefinitely from its original type, is not a whit more\r\narbitrary, and has this manifest claim to be preferred, that it will\r\naccount for a multitude of phenomena which the ordinary theory is\r\nincapable of explaining.\r\n\r\nWe have no right, they say, to assume, should we find that a variable\r\nspecies can no longer be made to vary in a certain direction, that it\r\nhas reached the utmost limit to which it might under more favourable\r\nconditions or if more time were allowed be made to diverge from the\r\nparent type.\r\n\r\nHybridisation is not considered by Mr. Darwin as a cause of new species,\r\nbut rather as tending to keep variation within bounds. Varieties which\r\nare nearly allied cross readily with each other, and with the parent\r\nstock, and such crossing tends to keep the species true to its type,\r\nwhile forms which are less nearly related, although they may intermarry,\r\nproduce no mule offspring capable of perpetuating their kind.\r\n\r\nThe competition of races and species, observes Mr. Darwin, is always\r\nmost severe between those which are most closely allied and which\r\nfill nearly the same place in the economy of nature. Hence when the\r\nconditions of existence are modified the original stock runs great risk\r\nof being superseded by some one of its modified offshoots. The new race\r\nor species may not be absolutely superior in the sum of its powers and\r\nendowments to the parent stock, and may even be more simple in structure\r\nand of a lower grade of intelligence, as well as of organisation,\r\nprovided on the whole it happens to have some slight advantage over\r\nits rivals. Progression, therefore, is not a necessary accompaniment\r\nof variation and natural selection, though when a higher organisation\r\nhappens to be coincident with superior fitness to new conditions, the\r\nnew species will have greater power and a greater chance of permanently\r\nmaintaining and extending its ground. One of the principal claims of Mr.\r\nDarwin's theory to acceptance is that it enables us to dispense with a\r\nlaw of progression as a necessary accompaniment of variation. It will\r\naccount equally well for what is called degradation, or a retrograde\r\nmovement towards a simpler structure, and does not require Lamarck's\r\ncontinual creation of monads; for this was a necessary part of his\r\nsystem, in order to explain how, after the progressive power had been\r\nat work for myriads of ages, there were as many beings of the simplest\r\nstructure in existence as ever.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin argues, and with no small success, that all true\r\nclassification in zoology and botany is in fact genealogical, and that\r\ncommunity of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been\r\nunconsciously seeking, while they often imagined that they were looking\r\nfor some unknown plan of creation.\r\n\r\nAs the \"Origin of Species\"* is in itself a condensed abstract of a much\r\nlarger work not yet published [41] I could not easily give an analysis\r\nof its contents within narrower limits than those of the original, but\r\nit may be useful to enumerate briefly some of the principal classes of\r\nphenomena on which the theory of \"natural selection\" would throw light.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Origin of Species\" page 121.)\r\n\r\nIn the first place it would explain, says Mr. Darwin, the unity of type\r\nwhich runs through the whole organic world, and why there is sometimes a\r\nfundamental agreement in structure in the same class of beings which is\r\nquite independent of their habits of life, for such structure, derived\r\nby inheritance from a remote progenitor, has been modified in the course\r\nof ages in different ways according to the conditions of existence.\r\nIt would also explain why all living and extinct beings are united, by\r\ncomplex radiating and circuitous lines of affinity with one another into\r\none grand system;* also, there having been a continued extinction of old\r\nraces and species in progress and a formation of new ones by variation,\r\nwhy in some genera which are largely represented, or to which a great\r\nmany species belong, many of these are closely but unequally related;\r\nalso, why there are distinct geographical provinces of species of\r\nanimals and plants, for after long isolation by physical barriers each\r\nfauna and flora by varying continually must become distinct from its\r\nancestral type, and from the new forms assumed by other descendants\r\nwhich have diverged from the same stock.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Origin\" page 498.)\r\n\r\nThe theory of indefinite modification would also explain why rudimentary\r\norgans are so useful in classification, being the remnants preserved\r\nby inheritance of organs which the present species once used--as in the\r\ncase of the rudiments of eyes in insects and reptiles inhabiting dark\r\ncaverns, or of the wings of birds and beetles which have lost all\r\npower of flight. In such cases the affinities of species are often more\r\nreadily discerned by reference to these imperfect structures than\r\nby others of much more physiological importance to the individuals\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe same hypothesis would explain why there are no mammalia in islands\r\nfar from continents, except bats, which can reach them by flying; and\r\nalso why the birds, insects, plants, and other inhabitants of islands,\r\neven when specifically unlike, usually agree generically with those of\r\nthe nearest continent, it being assumed that the original stock of such\r\nspecies came by migration from the nearest land.\r\n\r\nVariation and natural selection would also afford a key to a multitude\r\nof geological facts otherwise wholly unaccounted for, as for example why\r\nthere is generally an intimate connection between the living animals\r\nand plants of each great division of the globe and the extinct fauna and\r\nflora of the Post-Tertiary or Tertiary formations of the same region;\r\nas, for example, in North America, where we not only find among the\r\nliving mollusca peculiar forms foreign to Europe, such as Gnathodon\r\nand Fulgur (a subgenus of Fusus), but meet also with extinct species of\r\nthose same genera in the Tertiary fauna of the same part of the world.\r\nIn like manner, among the mammalia we find in Australia not only living\r\nkangaroos and wombats, but fossil individuals of extinct species of the\r\nsame genera. So also there are recent and fossil sloths, armadilloes\r\nand other Edentata in South America, and living and extinct species\r\nof elephant, rhinoceros, tiger, and bear in the great Europeo-Asiatic\r\ncontinent. The theory of the origin of new species by variation will\r\nalso explain why a species which has once died out never reappears\r\nand why the fossil fauna and flora recede farther and farther from the\r\nliving type in proportion as we trace them back to remoter ages. It\r\nwould also account for the fact that when we have to intercalate a new\r\nset of fossiliferous strata between two groups previously known, the\r\nnewly discovered fossils serve to fill up gaps between specific or\r\ngeneric types previously familiar to us, supplying often the missing\r\nlinks of the chain, which, if transmutation is accepted, must once have\r\nbeen continuous.\r\n\r\nOne of the most original speculations in Mr. Darwin's work is derived\r\nfrom the fact that, in the breeding of animals, it is often observed\r\nthat at whatever age any variation first appears in the parent, it tends\r\nto reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring. Hence the young\r\nindividuals of two races which have sprung from the same parent stock\r\nare usually more like each other than the adults. Thus the puppies\r\nof the greyhound and bull-dog are much more nearly alike in their\r\nproportions than the grown-up dogs, and in like manner the foals of the\r\ncarthorse and racehorse than the adult individuals. For the same reason\r\nwe may understand why the species of the same genus, or genera of the\r\nsame family, resemble each other more nearly in their embryonic than in\r\ntheir more fully developed state, or how it is that in the eyes of\r\nmost naturalists the structure of the embryo is even more important in\r\nclassification than that of the adult, \"for the embryo is the animal in\r\nits less modified state, and in so far it reveals the structure of its\r\nprogenitor. In two groups of animals, however much they may at present\r\ndiffer from each other in structure and habits, if they pass through\r\nthe same or similar embryonic stages, we may feel assured that they\r\nhave both descended from the same or nearly similar parents, and are\r\ntherefore in that degree closely related. Thus community in embryonic\r\nstructure reveals community of descent, however much the structure of\r\nthe adult may have been modified.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Darwin, \"Origin\" etc. page 448.)\r\n\r\nIf then there had been a system of progressive development, the\r\nsuccessive changes through which the embryo of a species of a high\r\nclass, a mammifer for example, now passes, may be expected to present us\r\nwith a picture of the stages through which, in the course of ages, that\r\nclass of animals has successively passed in advancing from a lower to a\r\nhigher grade. Hence the embryonic states exhibited one after the other\r\nby the human individual bear a certain amount of resemblance to those\r\nof the fish, reptile, and bird before assuming those of the highest\r\ndivision of the vertebrata.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, after making a laborious analysis of many floras, found that\r\nthose genera which are represented by a large number of species contain\r\na greater number of variable species, relatively speaking, than the\r\nsmaller genera or those less numerously represented. This fact he\r\nadduces in support of his opinion that varieties are incipient species,\r\nfor he observes that the existence of the larger genera implies that\r\nthe manufacturing of species has been active in the period immediately\r\npreceding our own, in which case we ought generally to find the same\r\nforces still in full activity, more especially as we have every reason\r\nto believe the process by which new species are produced is a slow one.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Origin of Species\" chapter 2 page 56.)\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker tells us that he was long disposed to doubt this result,\r\nas he was acquainted with so many variable small genera, but after\r\nexamining Mr. Darwin's data, he was compelled to acquiesce in his\r\ngeneralisation.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Introductory Essay to the Flora of Australia\" page 6.)\r\n\r\nIt is one of those conclusions, to verify which requires the\r\ninvestigation of many thousands of species, and to which exceptions may\r\neasily be adduced both in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, so that\r\nit will be long before we can expect it to be thoroughly tested, and\r\nif true, fairly appreciated. Among the most striking exceptions will\r\nbe some genera still large, but which are beginning to decrease, the\r\nconditions favourable to their former predominance having already\r\nbegun to change. To many, this doctrine of \"natural selection,\" or\r\n\"the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life,\" seems so\r\nsimple, when once clearly stated, and so consonant with known facts and\r\nreceived principles, that they have difficulty in conceiving how it can\r\nconstitute a great step in the progress of science. Such is often the\r\ncase with important discoveries, but in order to assure ourselves that\r\nthe doctrine was by no means obvious, we have only to refer back to the\r\nwritings of skilful naturalists who attempted in the earlier part of the\r\nnineteenth century to theorise on this subject, before the invention of\r\nthis new method of explaining how certain forms are supplanted by new\r\nones and in what manner these last are selected out of innumerable\r\nvarieties and rendered permanent.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HOOKER ON THE THEORY OF \"CREATION BY VARIATION\" AS APPLIED TO THE\r\nVEGETABLE KINGDOM.\r\n\r\nOf Dr. Hooker, whom I have often cited in this chapter, Mr. Darwin has\r\nspoken in the Introduction to his \"Origin of Species,\" as one \"who had,\r\nfor fifteen years, aided him in every possible way, by his large stores\r\nof knowledge, and his excellent judgment.\" This distinguished botanist\r\npublished his \"Introductory Essay to the Flora of Australia\" in December\r\n1859, the year after the memoir on \"Natural Selection\" was communicated\r\nto the Linnaean Society, and a month after the appearance of the \"Origin\r\nof Species.\"\r\n\r\nHaving, in the course of his extensive travels, studied the botany of\r\narctic, temperate, and tropical regions, and written on the flora of\r\nIndia, which he had examined at all heights above the sea from the\r\nplains of Bengal to the limits of perpetual snow in the Himalaya, and\r\nhaving specially devoted his attention to \"geographical varieties,\" or\r\nthose changes of character which plants exhibit when traced over wide\r\nareas and seen under new conditions; being also practically versed in\r\nthe description and classification of new plants, from various parts of\r\nthe world, and having been called upon carefully to consider the\r\nclaims of thousands of varieties to rank as species, no one was better\r\nqualified by observation and reflection to give an authoritative opinion\r\non the question, whether the present vegetation of the globe is or is\r\nnot in accordance with the theory which Mr. Darwin has proposed. We\r\ncannot but feel, therefore, deeply interested when we find him making\r\nthe following declaration:\r\n\r\n\"The mutual relations of the plants of each great botanical province,\r\nand, in fact, of the world generally, is just such as would have\r\nresulted if variation had gone on operating throughout indefinite\r\nperiods, in the same manner as we see it act in a limited number of\r\ncenturies, so as gradually to give rise in the course of time, to the\r\nmost widely divergent forms.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same essay, this author remarks, \"The element of mutability\r\npervades the whole Vegetable Kingdom; no class, nor order, nor genus of\r\nmore than a few species claims absolute exemption from it, whilst the\r\ngrand total of unstable forms, generally assumed to be species, probably\r\nexceeds that of the stable.\" Yet he contends that species are neither\r\nvisionary, nor even arbitrary creations of the naturalist, but\r\nrealities, though they may not remain true for ever. The majority\r\nof them, he remarks, are so far constant, \"within the range of our\r\nexperience,\" and their forms and characters so faithfully handed down\r\nthrough thousands of generations, that they admit of being treated as if\r\nthey were permanent and immutable. But the range of \"our experience\" is\r\nso limited, that it will \"not account for a single fact in the present\r\ngeographical distribution, or origin of any one species of plant, nor\r\nfor the amount of variation it has undergone, nor will it indicate the\r\ntime when it first appeared, nor the form it had when created.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Hooker, \"Introductory Essay to the Flora of Australia.\")\r\n\r\nTo what an extent the limits of species are indefinable, is evinced, he\r\nsays, by the singular fact that, among those botanists who believe them\r\nto be immutable, the number of flowering plants is by some assumed to be\r\n80,000, and by others over 150,000. The general limitation of species\r\nto certain areas suggests the idea that each of them, with all their\r\nvarieties, have sprung from a common parent and have spread in various\r\ndirections from a common centre. The frequency also of the grouping of\r\ngenera within certain geographical limits is in favour of the same\r\nlaw, although the migration of species may sometimes cause apparent\r\nexceptions to the rule and make the same types appear to have originated\r\nindependently at different spots.*\r\n\r\n     (* Ibid. page 13.)\r\n\r\nCertain genera of plants, which, like the brambles, roses, and willows\r\nin Europe, consist of a continuous series of varieties between the terms\r\nof which no intermediate forms can be intercalated, may be supposed\r\nto be newer types and on the increase, and therefore undergoing much\r\nvariation; whereas genera which present no such perplexing gradations\r\nmay be of older date and may have been losing species and varieties by\r\nextinction. In this case, the annihilation of intermediate forms which\r\nonce existed makes it an easy task to distinguish those which remain.\r\n\r\nIt had usually been supposed by the advocates of the immutability of\r\nspecies that domesticated races, if allowed to run wild, always revert\r\nto their parent type. Mr. Wallace had said in reply that a domesticated\r\nspecies, if it loses the protection of Man, can only stand its ground\r\nin a wild state by resuming those habits and recovering those attributes\r\nwhich it may have lost when under domestication. If these faculties are\r\nso much enfeebled as to be irrecoverable it will perish; if not and if\r\nit can adapt itself to the surrounding conditions, it will revert to the\r\nstate in which Man first found it: for in one, two, or three thousand\r\nyears, which may have elapsed since it was originally tamed, there will\r\nnot have been time for such geographical, climatal, and organic changes\r\nas would only be suited to a new race or a new and allied species.\r\n\r\nBut in regard to plants Dr. Hooker questions the fact of reversion.\r\nAccording to him, species in general do not readily vary, but when they\r\nonce begin to do so the new varieties, as every horticulturist knows,\r\nshow a great inclination to go on departing more and more from the\r\nold stock. As the best marked varieties of a wild species occur on the\r\nconfines of the area which it inhabits, so the best marked varieties of\r\na cultivated plant are those last produced by the gardener. Cabbages,\r\nfor example, wall fruits, and cereal, show no disposition, when\r\nneglected, to assume the characters of the wild states of these plants.\r\nHence the difficulty of determining what are the true parent species of\r\nmost of our cultivated plants. Thus the finer kinds of apples, if grown\r\nfrom seed, degenerate and become crabs, but in so doing they do not\r\nrevert to the original wild crab-apple, but become crab states of the\r\nvarieties to which they belong.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Introductory Essay to the Flora of Australia\" page 9.)\r\n\r\nIt would lead me into too long a digression were I to attempt to give a\r\nfuller analysis of this admirable essay; but I may add that none of\r\nthe observations are more in point, as bearing on the doctrine of what\r\nHooker terms \"creation by variation,\" than the great extent to which\r\nthe internal characters and properties of plants, or their physiological\r\nconstitution, are capable of being modified, while they exhibit\r\nexternally no visible departure from the normal form. Thus, in one\r\nregion a species may possess peculiar medicinal qualities which it wants\r\nin another, or it may be hardier and better able to resist cold. The\r\naverage range in altitude, says Hooker, of each species of flowering\r\nplant in the Himalayan Mountains, whether in the tropical, temperate,\r\nor Alpine region, is 4000 feet, which is equivalent to twelve degrees\r\nof isothermals of latitude. If an individual of any of these species be\r\ntaken from the upper limits of its range and carried to England, it is\r\nfound to be better able to stand our climate than those from the lower\r\nor warmer stations. When several of these internal or physiological\r\nmodifications are accompanied by variation in size, habits of growth,\r\ncolour of the flowers, and other external characters, and these are\r\nfound to be constant in successive generations, botanists may well begin\r\nto differ in opinion as to whether they ought to regard them as distinct\r\nspecies or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS.\r\n\r\nHitherto, no rival hypothesis has been proposed as a substitute for the\r\ndoctrine of transmutation; for what we term \"independent creation,\" or\r\nthe direct intervention of the Supreme Cause, must simply be considered\r\nas an avowal that we deem the question to lie beyond the domain of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe discovery by Steenstrup of alternate generation enlarges our views\r\nof the range of metamorphosis through which a species may pass, so\r\nthat some of its stages (as when a Sertularia and a Medusa interchange)\r\ndeviate so far from others as to have been referred by able zoologists\r\nto distinct genera, or even families. But in all these cases the\r\norganism, after running through a certain cycle of change, returns to\r\nthe exact point from which it set out, and no new form or species is\r\nthereby introduced into the world. The only secondary cause therefore\r\nwhich has as yet been even conjecturally brought forward, to explain how\r\nin the ordinary course of nature a new specific form may be generated\r\nis, as Lamarck declared, \"variation,\" and this has been rendered a far\r\nmore probable hypothesis by the way in which \"natural selection\" is\r\nshown to give intensity and permanency to certain varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENT CREATION.\r\n\r\nWhen I formerly advocated the doctrine that species were primordial\r\ncreations and not derivative, I endeavoured to explain the manner of\r\ntheir geographical distribution, and the affinity of living forms to\r\nthe fossil types nearest akin to them in the Tertiary strata of the\r\nsame part of the globe, by supposing that the creative power, which\r\noriginally adapts certain types to aquatic and others to terrestrial\r\nconditions, has at successive geological epochs introduced new forms\r\nbest suited to each area and climate, so as to fill the places of those\r\nwhich may have died out.\r\n\r\nIn that case, although the new species would differ from the old (for\r\nthese would not be revived, having been already proved by the fact of\r\ntheir extinction to be incapable of holding their ground), still they\r\nwould resemble their predecessors generically. For, as Mr. Darwin states\r\nin regard to new races, those of a dominant type inherit the advantages\r\nwhich made their parent species flourish in the same country, and they\r\nlikewise partake in those general advantages which made the genus to\r\nwhich the parent species belonged a large genus in its own country.\r\n\r\nWe might therefore, by parity of reasoning, have anticipated that the\r\ncreative power, adapting the new types to the new combination of organic\r\nand inorganic conditions of a given region, such as its soil,\r\nclimate, and inhabitants, would introduce new modifications of the old\r\ntypes--marsupials, for example, in Australia, new sloths and armadilloes\r\nin South America, new heaths at the Cape, new roses in the northern\r\nand new calceolarias in the southern hemisphere. But to this line of\r\nargument Mr. Darwin and Dr. Hooker reply that when animals or plants\r\nmigrate into new countries, whether assisted by man or without his aid,\r\nthe most successful colonisers appertain by no means to those types\r\nwhich are most allied to the old indigenous species. On the contrary it\r\nmore frequently happens that members of genera, orders, or even classes,\r\ndistinct and foreign to the invaded country, make their way most rapidly\r\nand become dominant at the expense of the endemic species. Such is the\r\ncase with the placental quadrupeds in Australia, and with horses and\r\nmany foreign plants in the pampas of South America, and numberless\r\ninstances in the United States and elsewhere which might easily be\r\nenumerated. Hence the transmutationists infer that the reason why these\r\nforeign types, so peculiarly fitted for these regions, have never\r\nbefore been developed there is simply that they were excluded by natural\r\nbarriers. But these barriers of sea or desert or mountain could never\r\nhave been of the least avail had the creative force acted independently\r\nof material laws or had it not pleased the Author of Nature that the\r\norigin of new species should be governed by some secondary causes\r\nanalogous to those which we see preside over the appearance of new\r\nvarieties, which never appear except as the offspring of a parent stock\r\nvery closely resembling them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22. -- OBJECTIONS TO THE HYPOTHESIS OF TRANSMUTATION CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\n  Statement of Objections to the Hypothesis of Transmutation\r\n     founded on the Absence of Intermediate Forms.\r\n  Genera of which the Species are closely allied.\r\n  Occasional Discovery of the missing Links in a Fossil State.\r\n  Davidson's Monograph on the Brachiopoda.\r\n  Why the Gradational Forms, when found, are not accepted as\r\n     Evidence of Transmutation.\r\n  Gaps caused by Extinction of Races and Species.\r\n  Vast Tertiary Periods during which this Extinction has been going\r\n     on in the Fauna and Flora now existing.\r\n  Genealogical Bond between Miocene and Recent Plants and Insects.\r\n  Fossils of Oeningen.\r\n  Species of Insects in Britain and North America represented by\r\n     distinct Varieties.\r\n  Falconer's Monograph on living and fossil Elephants.\r\n  Fossil Species and Genera of the Horse Tribe in North and\r\n     South America.\r\n  Relation of the Pliocene Mammalia of North America, Asia,\r\n     and Europe.\r\n  Species of Mammalia, though less persistent than the Mollusca,\r\n     change slowly.\r\n  Arguments for and against Transmutation derived from the Absence\r\n     of Mammalia in Islands.\r\n  Imperfection of the Geological Record.\r\n  Intercalation of newly discovered Formation of intermediate Age\r\n     in the chronological Series.\r\n  Reference of the St. Cassian Beds to the Triassic Periods.\r\n  Discovery of new organic Types.\r\n  Feathered Archaeopteryx of the Oolite.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF TRANSMUTATION--ABSENCE OF INTERMEDIATE LINKS.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious and popular of the objections urged against the theory\r\nof transmutation may be thus expressed: If the extinct species of plants\r\nand animals of the later geological periods were the progenitors of\r\nthe living species, and gave origin to them by variation and natural\r\nselection, where are all the intermediate forms, fossil and living,\r\nthrough which the lost types must have passed during their conversion\r\ninto the living ones? And why do we not find almost everywhere passages\r\nbetween the nearest allied species and genera, instead of such strong\r\nlines of demarcation and often wide intervening gaps?\r\n\r\nWe may consider this objection under two heads:--\r\n\r\nFirst. To what extent are the gradational links really wanting in the\r\nliving creation or in the fossil world, and how far may we expect to\r\ndiscover such as are missing by future research?\r\n\r\nSecondly. Are the gaps more numerous than we ought to anticipate,\r\nallowing for the original defective state of the geological records,\r\ntheir subsequent dilapidation and our slight acquaintance with\r\nsuch parts of them as are extant, and allowing also for the rate of\r\nextinction of races and species now going on, and which has been going\r\non since the commencement of the Tertiary period?\r\n\r\nFirst. As to the alleged absence of intermediate varieties connecting\r\none species with another, every zoologist and botanist who has engaged\r\nin the task of classification has been occasionally thrown into this\r\ndilemma--if I make more than one species in this group, I must, to be\r\nconsistent, make a great many. Even in a limited region like the British\r\nIsles this embarrassment is continually felt.\r\n\r\nScarcely any two botanists, for example, can agree as to the number of\r\nroses, still less as to how many species of bramble we possess. Of the\r\nlatter genus, Rubus, there is one set of forms respecting which it is\r\nstill a question whether it ought to be regarded as constituting three\r\nspecies or thirty-seven. Mr. Bentham adopts the first alternative and\r\nMr. Babington the second, in their well-known treatises on British\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Dr. Hooker that at the antipodes, both in New Zealand and\r\nAustralia, this same genus Rubus is represented by several species rich\r\nin individuals and remarkable for their variability. When we consider\r\nhow, as we extend our knowledge of the same plant over a wider area, new\r\ngeographical varieties commonly present themselves, and then endeavour\r\nto imagine the number of forms of the genus Rubus which may now exist,\r\nor probably have existed, in Europe and in regions intervening between\r\nEurope and Australia, comprehending all which may have flourished in\r\nTertiary and Post-Tertiary periods, we shall perceive how little stress\r\nshould be laid on arguments founded on the assumed absence of missing\r\nlinks in the flora as it now exists.\r\n\r\nIf in the battle of life the competition is keenest between closely\r\nallied varieties and species, as Mr. Darwin contends, many forms can\r\nnever be of long duration, nor have a wide range, and these must often\r\npass away without leaving behind them any fossil memorials. In this\r\nmanner we may account for many breaks in the series which no future\r\nresearches will ever fill up.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVIDSON ON FOSSIL BRACHIOPODA.\r\n\r\nIt is from fossil conchology more than from any other department of the\r\norganic world that we may hope to derive traces of a transition from\r\ncertain types to others, and fossil memorials of all the intermediate\r\nshades of form. We may especially hope to gain this information from the\r\nstudy of some of the lower groups, such as the Brachiopoda, which are\r\npersistent in type, so that the thread of our inquiry is less likely to\r\nbe interrupted by breaks in the sequence of the fossiliferous rocks.\r\nThe splendid monograph just concluded by Mr. Davidson on the British\r\nBrachiopoda, illustrates, in the first place, the tendency of certain\r\ngeneric forms in this division of the mollusca to be persistent\r\nthroughout the whole range of geological time yet known to us; for\r\nthe four genera, Rhynchonella, Crania, Discina, and Lingula, have been\r\ntraced through the Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Jurassic,\r\nCretaceous, Tertiary, and Recent periods, and still retain in the\r\nexisting seas the identical shape and character which they exhibited in\r\nthe earliest formations. On the other hand, other Brachiopoda have gone\r\nthrough in shorter periods a vast series of transformations, so that\r\ndistinct specific and even generic names have been given to the same\r\nvarying form, according to the different aspects and characters it has\r\nput on in successive sets of strata.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as materials of comparison have accumulated, the\r\nnecessity of uniting species previously regarded as distinct under\r\none denomination has become more and more apparent. Mr. Davidson,\r\naccordingly, after studying not less than 260 reputed species from the\r\nBritish Carboniferous rocks, has been obliged to reduce that number to\r\n100, to which he has added 20 species either entirely new or new to the\r\nBritish strata; but he declares his conviction that, when our knowledge\r\nof these 120 Brachiopoda is more complete, a further reduction of\r\nspecies will take place.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of one of these forms, which he calls Spirifer trigonalis,\r\nhe says that it is so dissimilar to another extreme of the series, S.\r\ncrassa, that in the first part of his memoir (published some ten years\r\nago) he described them as distinct, and the idea of confounding them\r\ntogether must, he admits, appear absurd to those who have never seen the\r\nintermediate links, such as are presented by S. bisulcata, and at\r\nleast four others with their varieties, most of them shells formerly\r\nrecognised as distinct by the most eminent palaeontologists, but\r\nrespecting which these same authorities now agree with Mr. Davidson in\r\nuniting them into one species.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Monograph on British Brachiopoda\" Palaeontographical\r\n     Society page 222.)\r\n\r\nThe same species has sometimes continued to exist under slightly\r\nmodified forms throughout the whole of the Ordovician and Silurian as\r\nwell as the entire Devonian and Carboniferous periods, as in the case of\r\nthe shell generally known as Leptaena rhomboidalis, Wahlenberg. No less\r\nthan fifteen commonly received species are demonstrated by Mr. Davidson\r\nby the aid of a long series of transitional forms, to appertain to this\r\none type; and it is acknowledged by some of the best writers that they\r\nwere induced on purely theoretical grounds to give distinct names to\r\nsome of the varieties now suppressed, merely because they found them in\r\nrocks so widely remote in time that they deemed it contrary to\r\nanalogy to suppose that the same species could have endured so long:\r\na fallacious mode of reasoning, analogous to that which leads some\r\nzoologists and botanists to distinguish by specific names slight\r\nvarieties of living plants and animals met with in very remote\r\ncountries, as in Europe and Australia, for example; it being assumed\r\nthat each species has had a single birthplace or area of creation, and\r\nthat they could not by migration have gone from the northern to the\r\nsouthern hemisphere across the intervening tropics.\r\n\r\nExamples are also given by Mr. Davidson of species which pass from the\r\nDevonian into the Carboniferous, and from that again into the Permian\r\nrocks. The vast longevity of such specific forms has not been generally\r\nrecognised in consequence of the change of names which they have\r\nundergone when derived from such distant formations, as when Atrypa\r\nunguicularis assumes, when derived from a Carboniferous rock, the name\r\nof Spirifer Urei, besides several other synonyms, and then, when it\r\nreaches the Permian period, takes the name of Spirifer Clannyana, King;\r\nall of which forms the author of the monograph, now under consideration,\r\nasserts to be one and the same.\r\n\r\nNo geologist will deny that the distance of time which separates some\r\nof the eras above alluded to, or the dates of the earliest and latest\r\nappearances of some of the fossils above mentioned, must be reckoned by\r\nmillions of years. According to Mr. Darwin's views, it is only by having\r\nat our command the records of such enormous periods that we can expect\r\nto be able to point out the gradations which unite very distinct\r\nspecific forms. But the advocate of transmutation must not be\r\ndisappointed if, when he has succeeded in obtaining some of the proofs\r\nwhich he was challenged to produce, they make no impression on the mind\r\nof his opponent. All that will be conceded is that specific variation\r\nin the Brachiopoda, at least, has a wider range than was formerly\r\nsuspected. So long as several allied species were brought nearer and\r\nnearer to each other, considerable uneasiness might have been felt as\r\nto the reality of species in general, but when fifteen or more are\r\nonce fairly merged in one group, constituting in the aggregate a single\r\nspecies, one and indivisible, and capable of being readily distinguished\r\nfrom every other group at present known, all misgivings are at an end.\r\nImplicit trust in the immutability of species is then restored, and the\r\nmore insensible the shades from one extreme to the other, in a word,\r\nthe more complete the evidence of transition, the more nugatory does the\r\nargument derived from it appear. It then simply resolves itself into one\r\nof those exceptional instances of what is called a protean form.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago a great London dealer in shells, himself an able\r\nnaturalist, told me that there was nothing he had so much reason to\r\ndread, as tending to depreciate his stock in trade, as the appearance of\r\na good monograph on some large genus of mollusca; for, in proportion as\r\nthe work was executed in a philosophical spirit, it was sure to injure\r\nhim, every reputed species pronounced to be a mere variety becoming from\r\nthat time unsaleable. Fortunately, so much progress has since been\r\nmade in England in estimating the true ends and aims of science, that\r\nspecimens indicating a passage between forms usually separated by wide\r\ngaps, whether in the Recent or fossil fauna, are eagerly sought for, and\r\noften more prized than the mere normal or typical forms.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the more ancient the existing mollusca, or the farther\r\nback into the past we can trace the remains of shells still living, the\r\nmore easy it becomes to reconcile with the doctrine of transmutation the\r\ndistinctness in character of the majority of living species. For, what\r\nwe want is time, first, for the gradual formation, and then for the\r\nextinction of races and allied species, occasioning gaps between the\r\nsurvivors.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1830 I announced, on the authority of M. Deshayes, that\r\nabout one-fifth of the mollusca of the Falunian or Upper Miocene strata\r\nof Europe, belonged to living species. Although the soundness of that\r\nconclusion was afterwards called in question by two or three eminent\r\nconchologists (and by the late M. Alcide d'Orbigny among others), it has\r\nsince been confirmed by the majority of living naturalists and is well\r\nborne out by the copious evidence on the subject laid before the public\r\nin the magnificent work edited by Dr. Hoernes, and published under the\r\nauspices of the Austrian Government, \"On the Fossil Shells of the Vienna\r\nBasin.\"\r\n\r\nThe collection of Tertiary shells from which those descriptions and\r\nbeautiful figures were taken is almost unexampled for the fine state of\r\npreservation of the specimens, and the care with which all the varieties\r\nhave been compared. It is now admitted that about one-third of these\r\nMiocene forms, univalves and bivalves included, agree specifically with\r\nliving mollusca, so that much more than the enormous interval which\r\ndivides the Miocene from the Recent period must be taken into our\r\naccount when we speculate on the origin by transmutation of the\r\nshells now living, and the disappearance by extinction of intermediate\r\nvarieties and species.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIOCENE PLANTS AND INSECTS RELATED TO RECENT SPECIES.\r\n\r\nGeologists were acquainted with about three hundred species of marine\r\nshells from the Falunian strata on the banks of the Loire, before they\r\nknew anything of the contemporary insects and plants. At length, as if\r\nto warn us against inferring from negative evidence the poverty of any\r\nancient set of strata in organic remains proper to the land, a rich\r\nflora and entomological fauna was suddenly revealed to us characteristic\r\nof Central Europe during the Upper Miocene period. This result\r\nfollowed the determination of the true position of the Oeningen beds in\r\nSwitzerland, and of certain formations of \"Brown Coal\" in Germany.\r\n\r\nProfessor Heer, who has described nearly five hundred species of fossil\r\nplants from Oeningen, besides many more from other Miocene localities\r\nin Switzerland,* estimates the phanerogamous species which must have\r\nflourished in Central Europe at that time at 3000, and the insects as\r\nhaving been more numerous in the same proportion as they now exceed the\r\nplants in all latitudes.\r\n\r\n     (* Heer, \"Flora tertiaria Helvetiae\" 1859; and Gaudin's\r\n     French translation, with additions, 1861.)\r\n\r\nThis European Miocene flora was remarkable for the preponderance of\r\narborescent and shrubby evergreens, and comprised many generic types\r\nno longer associated together in any existing flora or geographical\r\nprovince. Some genera, for example, which are at present restricted to\r\nAmerica, co-existed in Switzerland with forms now peculiar to Asia, and\r\nwith others at present confined to Australia.\r\n\r\nProfessor Heer has not ventured to identify any of this vast assemblage\r\nof Miocene plants and insects with living species, so far at least as to\r\nassign to them the same specific names, but he presents us with a list\r\nof what he terms homologous forms, which are so like the living ones\r\nthat he supposes the one to have been derived genealogically from the\r\nothers. He hesitates indeed as to the manner of the transformation\r\nor the precise nature of the relationship, \"whether the changes were\r\nbrought about by some influence exerted continually for ages, or whether\r\nat some given moment the old types were struck with a new image.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the homologous plants alluded to are forty species, of which both\r\nthe leaves and fruits are preserved, and thirty others, known at present\r\nby their leaves only. In the first list we find many American types,\r\nsuch as the tulip tree (Liriodendron), the deciduous cypress (Taxodium),\r\nthe red maple and others, together with Japanese forms, such as a\r\ncinnamon, which is very abundant. And what is worthy of notice, some of\r\nthese fossils so closely allied to living plants occur not only in\r\nthe Upper, but even some few of them as far back in time as the Lower\r\nMiocene formations of Switzerland and Germany, which are probably as\r\ndistant from the Upper Miocene or Oeningen beds as are the latter from\r\nour own era.\r\n\r\nSome of the fossil plants to which Professor Heer has given new names\r\nhave been regarded as Recent species by other eminent naturalists. Thus,\r\none of the trees allied to the elm Unger had called Planera Richardi, a\r\nspecies which now flourishes in the Caucasus and Crete. Professor Heer\r\nhad attempted to distinguish it from the living tree by the greater size\r\nof its fruit, but this character he confessed did not hold good, when he\r\nhad an opportunity (1861) of comparing all the varieties of the living\r\nPlanera Richardi which Dr. Hooker laid before him in the rich herbarium\r\nof Kew.\r\n\r\nAs to the \"homologous insects\" of the Upper Miocene period in\r\nSwitzerland, we find among them, mingled with genera now wholly foreign\r\nto Europe, some very familiar forms, such as the common glowworm,\r\nLampyris noctiluca, Linn., the dung-beetle, Geotrupes stercorarius,\r\nLinn., the ladybird, Coccinella septempunctata, Linn., the ear-wig,\r\nForficula auricularia, Linn., some of our common dragon-flies, as\r\nLibellula depressa, Linn., the honey-bee, Apis mellifera, Linn., the\r\ncuckoo spittle insect, Aphrophora spumaria, Linn., and a long catalogue\r\nof others, to all of which Professor Heer had given new names, but which\r\nsome entomologists may regard as mere varieties until some stronger\r\nreasons are adduced for coming to a contrary opinion.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the insects above enumerated, like the common ladybird, are\r\nwell known at present to have a very wide range over nearly the whole\r\nof the Old World, for example, without varying, and might therefore be\r\nexpected to have been persistent throughout many successive changes of\r\nthe earth's surface and climate. Yet we may fairly anticipate that\r\neven the most constant types will have undergone some modifications in\r\npassing from the Miocene to the Recent epoch, since in the former period\r\nthe geography and climate of Europe, the height of the Alps, and the\r\ngeneral fauna and flora were so different from what they now are. But\r\nthe deviation may not exceed that which would generally be expressed by\r\nwhat is called a well-marked variety.\r\n\r\nBefore I pass on to another topic, it may be well to answer a question\r\nwhich may have occurred to the reader; how it happens that we remained\r\nso long ignorant of the vegetation and insects of the Upper Miocene\r\nperiod in Europe? The answer may be instructive to those who are in the\r\nhabit of underrating the former richness of the organic world wherever\r\nthey happen to have no evidence of its condition. A large part of\r\nthe Upper Miocene insects and plants alluded to have been met with at\r\nOeningen, near the Lake of Constance, in two or three spots embedded in\r\nthinly laminated marls, the entire thickness of which scarcely exceeds\r\n3 or 4 feet, and in two quarries of very limited dimensions. The\r\nrare combination of causes which seems to have led to the faithful\r\npreservation of so many treasures of a perishable nature in so small an\r\narea, appear to have been the following: first, a river flowing into a\r\nlake; secondly, storms of wind, by which leaves and sometimes the boughs\r\nof trees were torn off and floated by the stream into the lake; thirdly,\r\nmephitic gases rising from the lake, by which insects flying over its\r\nsurface were occasionally killed: and fourthly, a constant supply of\r\ncarbonate of lime in solution from mineral springs, the calcareous\r\nmatter when precipitated to the bottom mingling with fine mud and thus\r\nforming the fossiliferous marls.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIES OF INSECTS IN BRITAIN AND NORTH AMERICA, REPRESENTED BY DISTINCT\r\nVARIETIES.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the living British insects with those of the American\r\ncontinent, we frequently find that even those species which are\r\nconsidered to be identical, are nevertheless varieties of the European\r\ntypes. I have noticed this fact when speaking of the common English\r\nbutterfly, Vanessa atalanta, or \"red admiral,\" which I saw flying\r\nabout the woods of Alabama in mid-winter. I was unable to detect any\r\ndifference myself, but all the American specimens which I took to\r\nthe British Museum were observed by Mr. Doubleday to exhibit a slight\r\npeculiarity in the colouring of a minute part of the anterior wing,* a\r\ncharacter first detected by Mr. T.F. Stephens, who has also discovered\r\nthat similar slight, but equally constant variations, distinguish other\r\nLepidoptera now inhabiting the opposite sides of the Atlantic, insects\r\nwhich, nevertheless, he and Mr. Westwood and the late Mr. Kirby, have\r\nalways agreed to regard as mere varieties of the same species.\r\n\r\n     (* Lyell's \"Second Visit to the United States\" volume 2 page\r\n     293.)\r\n\r\nMr. T.V. Wollaston, in treating of the variation of insects in maritime\r\nsituations and small islands, has shown how the colour, growth of\r\nthe wings, and many other characters, undergo modification under the\r\ninfluence of local conditions, continued for long periods of time;* and\r\nMr. Brown has lately called our attention to the fact that the insects\r\nof the Shetland Isles present slight deviations from the corresponding\r\ntypes occurring in Great Britain, but far less marked than those which\r\ndistinguish the American from the European varieties.** In the case of\r\nShetland, Mr. Brown remarks, a land communication may well be supposed\r\nto have prevailed with Scotland at a more modern era than that between\r\nEurope and America. In fact, we have seen that Shetland can hardly fail\r\nto have been united with Scotland after the commencement of the glacial\r\nperiod (see map, Figure 41); whereas a communication between the north\r\nof Europe by Iceland and Greenland (which, as before stated, once\r\nenjoyed a genial climate) must have been anterior to the glacial epoch.\r\nA much larger isolation, and the impossibility of varieties formed\r\nin the two separated areas crossing with each other, would account,\r\naccording to Mr. Darwin's theory, for the much wider divergence observed\r\nin the specific types of the two regions.\r\n\r\n     (* Wollaston, \"On the Variation of Species\" etc. London\r\n     1856.)\r\n\r\n     (** \"Transactions of Northern Entomological Society\" 1862.)\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that at the commencement of the Glacial period\r\nthere was scarcely any appreciable difference between the molluscous\r\nfauna and that now living. When therefore the events of the Glacial\r\nperiod, as described in the earlier part of this volume, are duly\r\npondered on, and when we reflect that in the Upper Miocene period the\r\nliving species of mollusca constitute only one-third of the whole fauna,\r\nwe see clearly by how high a figure we must multiply the time in order\r\nto express the distance between the Miocene period and our own days.\r\n\r\nSPECIES OF MAMMALIA RECENT AND FOSSIL--PROBOSCIDIANS.\r\n\r\nBut it may perhaps be said that the mammalia afford more conspicuous\r\nexamples than do the mollusca, insects, or plants of the wide gaps which\r\nseparate species and genera, and that if in this higher class such a\r\nmultitude of transitional forms had ever existed as would be required\r\nto unite the Tertiary and Recent species into one series or net-work of\r\nallied or transitional forms, they could not so entirely have escaped\r\nobservation whether in the fossil or living fauna. A zoologist who\r\nentertains such an opinion would do well to devote himself to the\r\nstudy of some one genus of mammalia, such as the elephant, rhinoceros,\r\nhippopotamus, bear, horse, ox, or deer; and after collecting all the\r\nmaterials he can get together respecting the extinct and Recent species,\r\ndecide for himself whether the present state of science justifies his\r\nassuming that the chain could never have been continuous, the number of\r\nthe missing links being so great.\r\n\r\nAmong the extinct species formerly contemporary with man, no fossil\r\nquadruped has so often been alluded to in this work as the mammoth,\r\nElephas primigenius. From a monograph on the proboscidians by Dr.\r\nFalconer, it appears that this species represents one extreme of a type\r\nof which the Pliocene Mastodon borsoni represents the other. Between\r\nthese extremes there are already enumerated by Dr. Falconer no less\r\nthan twenty-six species, some of them ranging as far back in time as the\r\nMiocene period, others still living, like the Indian and African forms.\r\nTwo of these species, however, he has always considered as doubtful,\r\nStegodon ganesa, probably a mere variety of one of the others, and\r\nElephas priscus of Goldfuss, founded partly on specimens of the African\r\nelephant, assumed by mistake to be fossil, and partly on some aberrant\r\nforms of E. antiquus.\r\n\r\nThe first effect of the intercalation of so many intermediate forms\r\nbetween the two most divergent types, has been to break down almost\r\nentirely the generic distinction between Mastodon and Elephas. Dr.\r\nFalconer, indeed, observes that Stegodon (one of several subgenera which\r\nhe has founded) constitutes an intermediate group, from which the other\r\nspecies diverge through their dental characters, on the one side into\r\nthe mastodons, and on the other into the Elephants.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" volume 13\r\n     1857 page 314.)\r\n\r\nThe next result is to diminish the distance between the several members\r\nof each of these groups.\r\n\r\nDr. Falconer has discovered that no less than four species of\r\nelephant were formerly confounded together under the title of Elephas\r\nprimigenius, whence its supposed ubiquity in Pleistocene times, or its\r\nwide range over half the habitable globe. But even when this form\r\nhas been thus restricted in its specific characters, it has still its\r\ngeographical varieties; for the mammoth's teeth brought from America\r\nmay in most instances, according to Dr. Falconer, be distinguished from\r\nthose proper to Europe. On this American variety Dr. Leidy has conferred\r\nthe name of E. americanus. Another race of the same mammoth (as\r\ndetermined by Dr. Falconer) existed, as we have seen, before the Glacial\r\nperiod, or at the time when the buried forest of Cromer and the Norfolk\r\ncliffs was deposited; and the Swiss geologists have lately found remains\r\nof the mammoth in their country, both in pre-glacial and post-glacial\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of Dr. Falconer's monograph, two other species of\r\nelephant, F. mirificus, Leidy, and F. imperator, have been obtained\r\nfrom the Pliocene formations of the Niobrara Valley in Nebraska, one\r\nof which, however, may possibly be found hereafter to be the same as E.\r\ncolumbi, Falc. A remarkable dwarf species also (Elephas melitensis) has\r\nbeen discovered, belonging, like the existing E. africanus, to the group\r\nLoxodon. This species has been established by Dr. Falconer on remains\r\nfound by Captain Spratt R.N. in a cave in Malta.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Proceedings of the Geological Society\" London 1862.)\r\n\r\nHow much the difficulty of discriminating between the fossil\r\nrepresentatives of this genus may hereafter augment, when all the\r\nspecies with their respective geographical varieties are known, may be\r\ninferred from the following fact--Professor H. Schlegel, in a recently\r\npublished memoir, endeavours to show that the living elephant of Sumatra\r\nagrees with that of Ceylon, but is a distinct species from that of\r\nContinental India, being distinguishable by the number of its dorsal\r\nvertebrae and ribs, the form of its teeth, and other characteristics.*\r\n\r\n     (* Schlegel, \"Natural History Review\" Number 5 1862 page\r\n     72.)\r\n\r\nDr. Falconer, on the other hand, considers these two living species\r\nas mere geographical varieties, the characters referred to not being\r\nconstant, as he has ascertained, on comparing different individuals\r\nof E. indicus in different parts of Bengal in which the ribs vary from\r\nnineteen to twenty, and different varieties of E. africanus in which\r\nthey vary from twenty to twenty-one.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry into the various species of the genus Rhinoceros, recent and\r\nfossil, has led Dr. Falconer to analogous results, as might be inferred\r\nfrom what was said in Chapter 10, and as a forthcoming memoir by the\r\nsame writer will soon more fully demonstrate.\r\n\r\nAmong the fossils brought in 1858 by Mr. Hayden from the Niobrara\r\nValley, Dr. Leidy describes a rhinoceros so like the Asiatic species,\r\nR. indicus, that he at first referred it to the same, and, what is most\r\nsingular, he remarks generally of the Pliocene fauna of that part\r\nof North America that it is far more related in character to the\r\nPleistocene and Recent fauna of Europe than to that now inhabiting the\r\nAmerican continent.\r\n\r\nIt seems indeed more and more evident that when we speculate in future\r\non the pedigree of any extinct quadruped which abounds in the drift or\r\ncaverns of Europe, we shall have to look to North and South America as\r\na principal source of information. Thirty years ago, if we had been\r\nsearching for fossil types which might fill up a gap between two species\r\nor genera of the horse tribe (or great family of the Solipedes), we\r\nmight have thought it sufficient to have got together as ample materials\r\nas we could obtain from the continents of Europe, Africa, and Asia.\r\nWe might have presumed that as no living representative of the equine\r\nfamily, whether horse, ass, zebra, or quagga, had been furnished\r\nby North or South America when those regions were first explored by\r\nEuropeans, a search in the transatlantic world for fossil species might\r\nbe dispensed with. But how different is the prospect now opening before\r\nus! Mr. Darwin first detected the remains of a fossil horse during his\r\nvisit to South America, since which two other species have been met\r\nwith on the same continent, while in North America, in the valley of the\r\nNebraska alone, Mr. Hayden, besides a species not distinguishable\r\nfrom the domestic horse, has obtained, according to Dr. Leidy,\r\nrepresentatives of five other fossil genera of Solipedes. These he\r\nnames, Hipparion, Protohippus, Merychippus, Hypohippus, and Parahippus.\r\nOn the whole, no less than twelve equine species, belonging to seven\r\ngenera (including the Miocene Anchitherium of Nebraska), being already\r\ndetected in the Tertiary and Post-Tertiary formations of the United\r\nStates.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Science\"\r\n     Philadelphia for 1858 page 89.)\r\n\r\nProfessors Unger* and Heer** have advocated, on botanical grounds,\r\nthe former existence of an Atlantic continent during some part of the\r\nTertiary period, as affording the only plausible explanation that can be\r\nimagined, of the analogy between the Miocene flora of Central Europe and\r\nthe existing flora of Eastern America. Professor Oliver, on the other\r\nhand, after showing how many of the American types found fossil in\r\nEurope are common to Japan, inclines to the theory, first advanced by\r\nDr. Asa Gray, that the migration of species, to which the community of\r\ntypes in the eastern states of North America and the Miocene flora of\r\nEurope is due, took place when there was an overland communication from\r\nAmerica to eastern Asia between the fiftieth and sixtieth parallels of\r\nlatitude, or south of Behring Straits, following the direction of the\r\nAleutian islands.*** By this course they may have made their way, at any\r\nepoch, Miocene, Pliocene, or Pleistocene, antecedently to the glacial\r\nepoch, to Mongolia, on the east coast of northern Asia.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Die versunkene Insel Atlantis.\")\r\n\r\n     (** \"Flora tertiaria Helvetiae.\")\r\n\r\n     (*** Oliver, Lecture at the Royal Institution, March 7, 1862.)\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that a large proportion of the living quadrupeds of\r\nMongolia (34 out of 48) are specifically identical with those at present\r\ninhabiting the continent of Western Europe and the British Isles.\r\n\r\nA monograph on the hippopotamus, bear, ox, stag, or any other genus of\r\nmammalia common in the European drift or caverns, might equally well\r\nillustrate the defective state of the materials at present at our\r\ncommand. We are rarely in possession of one perfect skeleton of any\r\nextinct species, still less of skeletons of both sexes, and of different\r\nages. We usually know nothing of the geographical varieties of the\r\nPleistocene and Pliocene species, least of all, those successive changes\r\nof form which they must have undergone in the preglacial epoch between\r\nthe Upper Miocene and Pleistocene eras. Such being the poverty of\r\nour palaeontological data, we cannot wonder that osteologists are at\r\nvariance as to whether certain remains found in caverns are of the same\r\nspecies as those now living; whether, for example, the Talpa fossilis\r\nis really the common mole, the Meles morreni the common badger, Lutra\r\nantiqua the otter of Europe, Sciurus priscus the squirrel, Arctomys\r\nprimigenia the marmot, Myoxus fossilis the dormouse, Schmerling's Felis\r\nengihoulensis the European lynx, or whether Ursus spelaeus and Ursus\r\npriscus are not extinct races of the living brown bear (Ursus arctos).\r\n\r\nIf at some future period all the above-mentioned species should be\r\nunited with their allied congeners, it cannot fail to enlarge our\r\nconception of the modifications which a species is capable of undergoing\r\nin the course of time, although the same form may appear absolutely\r\nimmutable within the narrow range of our experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGEVITY OF SPECIES IN THE MAMMALIA.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Principles of Geology,\" in 1833,* I stated that the longevity of\r\nspecies in the class mollusca exceeded that in the mammalia. It has been\r\nsince found that this generalisation can be carried much farther, and\r\nthat in fact the law which governs the changes in organic being is such\r\nthat the lower their place in a graduated scale, or the simpler their\r\nstructure, the more persistent are they in form and organisation. I soon\r\nbecame aware of the force of this rule in the class mollusca, when I\r\nfirst attempted to calculate the numerical proportion of Recent species\r\nin the Newer Pliocene formations as compared to the Older Pliocene, and\r\nof them again as contrasted with the Miocene; for it appeared invariably\r\nthat a greater number of the lamellibranchs could be identified with\r\nliving species than of the gasteropods, and of these last a greater\r\nnumber in the lower division, that of entire-mouthed univalves, than in\r\nthat of the siphonated. In whatever manner the changes have been brought\r\nabout, whether by variation and natural selection, or by any other\r\ncauses, the rate of change has been greater where the grade of\r\norganisation is higher.\r\n\r\n     (* 1st edition volume 3 pages 48 and 140.)\r\n\r\nIt is only, therefore, where there is a full representation of all the\r\nprincipal orders of mollusca, or when we compare those of corresponding\r\ngrade, that we can fully rely on the percentage test, or on the\r\nproportion of Recent to extinct species as indicating the relation of\r\ntwo groups to the existing fauna.\r\n\r\nThe foraminifera which exemplify the lowest stage of animal existence\r\nexhibit, as we learn from the researches of Dr. Carpenter and of Messrs.\r\nJones and Parker, extreme variability in their specific forms, and\r\nyet these same forms are persistent throughout vast periods of time,\r\nexceeding, in that respect, even the brachiopods before mentioned.\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker observes, in regard to plants of complex floral structure,\r\nthat they manifest their physical superiority in a greater extent of\r\nvariation and in thus better securing a succession of race, an attribute\r\nwhich in some senses he regards as of a higher order than that indicated\r\nby mere complexity or specialisation of organ.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Introductory Essay to the Flora of Australia\" page 7.)\r\n\r\nAs one of the consequences of this law, he says that species, genera,\r\nand orders are, on the whole, best limited in plants of higher grade,\r\nthe dicotyledons better than the monocotyledons, and the Dichlamydeae\r\nbetter than the Achlamydeae.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin remarks, \"We can, perhaps, understand the apparently quicker\r\nrate of change in terrestrial, and in more highly organised productions,\r\ncompared with marine and lower productions, by the more complex\r\nrelations of the higher beings to their organic and inorganic conditions\r\nof life.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Origin of Species\" 3rd edition page 340.)\r\n\r\nIf we suppose the mammalia to be more sensitive than are the inferior\r\nclasses of the vertebrata, to every fluctuation in the surrounding\r\nconditions, whether of the animate or inanimate world, it would follow\r\nthat they would oftener be called upon to adapt themselves by variation\r\nto new conditions, or if unable to do so, to give place to other types.\r\nThis would give rise to more frequent extinction of varieties, species,\r\nand genera, whereby the surviving types would be better limited, and the\r\naverage duration of the same unaltered specific types would be lessened.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSENCE OF MAMMALIA IN ISLANDS CONSIDERED IN REFERENCE TO TRANSMUTATION.\r\n\r\nBut if mammalia vary upon the whole at a more rapid rate than animals\r\nlower in the scale of being, it must not be supposed that they can alter\r\ntheir habits and structures readily, or that they are convertible in\r\nshort periods into new species. The extreme slowness with which such\r\nchanges of habits and organisation take place, when new conditions\r\narise, appears to be well exemplified by the absence even of small\r\nwarm-blooded quadrupeds in islands far from continents, however well\r\nsuch islands may be fitted by their dimensions to support them.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin has pointed to this absence of mammalia as favouring his\r\nviews, observing that bats, which are the only exceptions to the rule,\r\nmight have made their way to distant islands by flight, for they are\r\noften met with on the wing far out at sea. Unquestionably, the total\r\nexclusion of quadrupeds in general, which could only reach such isolated\r\nhabitations by swimming, seems to imply that nature does not dispense\r\nwith the ordinary laws of reproduction when she peoples the earth with\r\nnew forms; for if causes purely immaterial were alone at work, we\r\nmight naturally look for squirrels, rabbits, polecats, and other small\r\nvegetable feeders and beasts of prey, as often as for bats, in the spots\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I have found it difficult to reconcile the antiquity\r\nof certain islands, such as those of the Madeiran Archipelago, and those\r\nof still larger size in the Canaries, with the total absence of small\r\nindigenous quadrupeds, for, judging by ancient deposits of littoral\r\nshells, now raised high above the level of the sea, several of these\r\nvolcanic islands (Porto Santo and the Grand Canary among others) must\r\nhave existed ever since the Upper Miocene period. But, waiving all such\r\nclaims to antiquity, it is at least certain that since the close of the\r\nNewer Pliocene period, Madeira, and Porto Santo have constituted two\r\nseparate islands, each in sight of the other, and each inhabited by an\r\nassemblage of land shells (Helix, Pupa, Clausilia, etc.), for the most\r\npart different or proper to each island. About thirty-two fossil species\r\nhave been obtained in Madeira, and forty-two in Porto Santo, only\r\nfive of the whole being common to both islands. In each the living\r\nland-shells are equally distinct, and correspond, for the most part,\r\nwith the species found fossil in each island respectively.\r\n\r\nAmong the fossil species, one or two appear to be entirely extinct,\r\nand a larger number have disappeared from the fauna of the Madeiran\r\nArchipelago, though still extant in Africa and Europe. Many which were\r\namongst the most common in the Pliocene period, have now become\r\nthe scarcest, and others formerly scarce, are now most numerously\r\nrepresented. The variety-making force has been at work with such\r\nenergy--perhaps we ought to say, has had so much time for its\r\ndevelopment--that almost every isolated rock within gun-shot of the\r\nshores has its peculiar living forms, or those very marked races to\r\nwhich Mr. Lowe, in his excellent description of the fauna, has given the\r\nname of \"sub-species.\"\r\n\r\nSince the fossil shells were embedded in sand near the coast, these\r\nvolcanic islands have undergone considerable alterations in size\r\nand shape by the wasting action of the waves of the Atlantic beating\r\nincessantly against the cliffs, so that the evidence of a vast lapse of\r\ntime is derivable from inorganic as well as from organic phenomena.\r\n\r\nDuring this period no mammalia, not even of small species, excepting\r\nbats, have made their appearance, whether in Madeira and Porto-Santo or\r\nin the larger and more numerous islands of the Canarian group. It might\r\nhave been expected, from some expressions met with here and there in the\r\n\"Origin of Species,\" though not perhaps from a fair interpretation\r\nof the whole tenor of the author's reasoning, that this dearth of the\r\nhighest class of vertebrata is inconsistent with the powers of mammalia\r\nto accommodate their habits and structures to new conditions. Why did\r\nnot some of the bats, for example, after they had greatly multiplied,\r\nand were hard pressed by a scarcity of insects on the wing, betake\r\nthemselves to the ground in search of prey, and, gradually losing their\r\nwings, become transformed into non-volant Insectivora? Mr. Darwin tells\r\nme that he has learnt that there is a bat in India which has been known\r\noccasionally to devour frogs. One might also be tempted to ask, how it\r\nhas happened that the seals which swarmed on the shores of Madeira and\r\nthe Canaries, before the European colonists arrived there, were never\r\ninduced, when food was scarce in the sea, to venture inland from the\r\nshores, and begin in Teneriffe, and the Grand Canary especially, and\r\nother large islands, to acquire terrestrial habits, venturing first\r\na few yards inland, and then farther and farther until they began to\r\noccupy some of the \"places left vacant in the economy of nature.\" During\r\nthese excursions, we might suppose some varieties, which had the skin\r\nof the webbed intervals of their toes less developed, to succeed best in\r\nwalking on the land, and in the course of several generations they might\r\nexchange their present gait or manner of shuffling along and jumping by\r\naid of the tail and their fin-like extremities, for feet better adapted\r\nfor running.\r\n\r\nIt is said that one of the bats in the island of Palma (one of the\r\nCanaries) is of a peculiar species, and that some of the Cheiroptera\r\nof the Pacific islands are even of peculiar genera. If so, we seem, on\r\norganic as well as on geological grounds, to be precluded from arguing\r\nthat there has not been time for great divergence of character. We seem\r\nalso entitled to ask why the bats and rodents of Australia, which are\r\nspread so widely among the marsupials over that continent, have never,\r\nunder the influence of the principle of progression, been developed\r\ninto higher placental types, since we have now ascertained that that\r\ncontinent was by no means unfitted to sustain such mammalia, for these\r\nwhen once introduced by Man have run wild and become naturalised in\r\nmany parts. The following answers may perhaps be offered to the above\r\ncriticisms of some of Mr. Darwin's theoretical views.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the bats and seals: they are what zoologists call aberrant\r\nand highly specialised types, and therefore precisely those which\r\nmight be expected to display a fixity and want of pliancy in their\r\norganisation, or the smallest possible aptitude for deviating in new\r\ndirections towards new structures, and the acquisition of such altered\r\nhabits as a change from aquatic to terrestrial or from Volant to\r\nnon-volant modes of living would imply.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the same powers of flight which enabled the first bats to\r\nreach Madeira or the Canaries, would bring others from time to time\r\nfrom the African continent, which, mixing with the first emigrants and\r\ncrossing with them, would check the formation of new races, or keep\r\nthem true to the old types, as is found to be actually the case with the\r\nbirds of Madeira and the Bermudas.\r\n\r\nThis would happen the more surely, if, as Mr. Darwin has endeavoured to\r\nprove, the offspring of races slightly varying are usually more\r\nvigorous than the progeny of parents of the same race, and would be more\r\nprolific, therefore, than the insular stock which had been for a long\r\ntime breeding in and in.\r\n\r\nThe same cause would tend in a still more decided manner to prevent the\r\nseals from diverging into new races or \"incipient species,\" because\r\nthey range freely over the wide ocean, and, may therefore have continual\r\nintercourse with all other individuals of their species.\r\n\r\nThirdly, as to peculiar species, and even genera of bats in islands, we\r\nare perhaps too little acquainted at present with all the species and\r\ngenera of the neighbouring continents to be able to affirm, with any\r\ndegree of confidence, that the forms supposed to be peculiar do not\r\nexist elsewhere: those of the Canaries in Africa, for example. But\r\nwhat is still more important, we must bear in mind how many species and\r\ngenera of Pleistocene mammalia have everywhere become extinct by causes\r\nindependent of Man. It is always possible, therefore, that some types\r\nof Cheiroptera, originally derived from the main land, have survived in\r\nislands, although they have gradually died out on the continents from\r\nwhence they came; so that it would be rash to infer that there has been\r\ntime for the creation, whether by variation or other agency, of new\r\nspecies or genera in the islands in question.\r\n\r\nAs to the Rodents and Cheiroptera of Australia, we are as yet too\r\nignorant of the Pleistocene and Pliocene fauna of that part of the\r\nworld, to be able to decide whether the introduction of such forms dates\r\nfrom a remote geological time. We know, however, that, before the Recent\r\nperiod, that continent was peopled with large kangaroos, and other\r\nherbivorous and carnivorous marsupials, of species long since extinct,\r\ntheir remains having been discovered in ossiferous caverns. The\r\npreoccupancy of the country by such indigenous tribes may have checked\r\nthe development of the placental Rodents and Cheiroptera, even were we\r\nto concede the possibility of such forms being convertible by variation\r\nand progressive development into higher grades of mammalia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD [42].\r\n\r\nWhen treating in the eighth chapter of the dearth of human bones in\r\nalluvium containing flint implements in abundance, I pointed out that it\r\nis not part of the plan of Nature to write everywhere, and at all times,\r\nher autobiographical memoirs. On the contrary, her annals are local and\r\nexceptional from the first, and portions of them are afterwards ground\r\ninto mud, sand, and pebbles, to furnish materials for new strata. Even\r\nof those ancient monuments now forming the crust of the earth, which\r\nhave not been destroyed by rivers and the waves of the sea, or which\r\nhave escaped being melted by volcanic heat, three-fourths lie submerged\r\nbeneath the ocean, and are inaccessible to Man; while of those which\r\nform the dry land, a great part are hidden for ever from our observation\r\nby mountain masses, thousands of feet thick, piled over them.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin has truly said that the fossiliferous rocks known to\r\ngeologists consist, for the most part, of such as were formed when the\r\nbottom of the sea was subsiding. This downward movement protects the\r\nnew deposits from denudation, and allows them to accumulate to a great\r\nthickness; whereas sedimentary matter, thrown down where the sea-bottom\r\nis rising, must almost invariably be swept away by the waves as fast as\r\nthe land emerges.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect, therefore, on the fractional state of the annals\r\nwhich are handed down to us, and how little even these have as yet been\r\nstudied, we may wonder that so many geologists should attribute every\r\nbreak in the series of strata and every gap in the past history of the\r\norganic world to catastrophes and convulsions of the earth's crust or\r\nto leaps made by the creational force from species to species, or from\r\nclass to class. For it is clear that, even had the series of monuments\r\nbeen perfect and continuous at first (an hypothesis quite opposed to the\r\nanalogy of the working of causes now in action), it could not fail to\r\npresent itself to our eyes in a broken and disconnected state.\r\n\r\nThose geologists who have watched the progress of discovery during the\r\nlast half century can best appreciate the extent to which we may still\r\nhope by future exertion to fill up some of the wider chasms which\r\nnow interrupt the regular sequence of fossiliferous rocks. The\r\ndetermination, for example, of late years of the true place of the\r\nHallstadt and St. Cassian beds on the north and south flanks of the\r\nAustrian Alps, has revealed to us, for the first time, the marine fauna\r\nof a period (that of the Upper Trias) of which, until lately, but little\r\nwas known. In this case, the palaeontologist is called upon suddenly to\r\nintercalate about 800 species of Mollusca and Radiata, between the fauna\r\nof the Lower Lias and that of the Middle Trias. The period in question\r\nwas previously believed, even by many a philosophical geologist, to\r\nhave been comparatively barren of organic types. In England, France,\r\nand northern Germany, the only known strata of Upper Triassic date had\r\nconsisted almost entirely of fresh or brackish-water beds, in which\r\nthe bones of terrestrial and amphibious reptiles were the most\r\ncharacteristic fossils. The new fauna was, as might have been expected,\r\nin part peculiar, not a few of the species of Mollusca being referable\r\nto new genera; while some species were common to the older, and some\r\nto the newer rocks. On the whole, the new forms have helped greatly to\r\nlessen the discordance, not only between the Lias and Trias, but also\r\ngenerally between Palaeozoic and Mesozoic formations. Thus the genus\r\nOrthoceras has been for the first time recognised in a Mesozoic deposit,\r\nand with it we find associated, for the first time, large Ammonites\r\nwith foliated lobes, a form never seen before below the Lias; also the\r\nCeratites, a family of Cephalopods never before met with in the Upper\r\nTrias, and never before in the same stratum with such lobed Ammonites.\r\n\r\nWe can now no longer doubt that should we hereafter have an opportunity\r\nof studying an equally rich marine fauna of the age of the Lower Trias\r\n(or Bunter Sandstein), the marked hiatus which still separates the\r\nTriassic and Permian eras would almost disappear.\r\n\r\nArchaeopteryx macrurus, Owen.\r\n\r\nI could readily add a copious list of minor deposits, belonging to the\r\nPrimary, Secondary and Tertiary series, which we have been called upon\r\nin like manner to intercalate in the course of the last quarter of a\r\ncentury into the chronological series previously known; but it would\r\nlead me into too long a digression. I shall therefore content myself\r\nwith pointing out that it is not simply new formations which are brought\r\nto light from year to year, reminding us of the elementary state of\r\nour knowledge of palaeontology, but new types also of structure are\r\ndiscovered in rocks whose fossil contents were supposed to be peculiarly\r\nwell known.\r\n\r\nThe last and most striking of these novelties is \"the feathered fossil\"\r\nfrom the lithographic stone of Solenhofen.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1858, no well-determined skeleton of a bird had been\r\ndetected in any rocks older than the Tertiary. In that year, Mr. Lucas\r\nBarrett found in the Cambridge Greensand of the Cretaceous series, the\r\nfemur, tibia, and some other bones of a swimming bird, supposed by him\r\nto be of the gull tribe. His opinion as to the ornithic character of the\r\nremains was afterwards confirmed by Professor Owen.\r\n\r\nThe Archaeopteryx macrurus, Owen, recently acquired by the British\r\nMuseum, affords a second example of the discovery of the osseous remains\r\nof a bird in strata older than the Eocene. It was found in the great\r\nquarries of lithographic limestone at Solenhofen in Bavaria, the rock\r\nbeing a member of the Upper Oolite.\r\n\r\nIt was at first conjectured in Germany, before any experienced\r\nosteologist had had an opportunity of inspecting the original specimen,\r\nthat this fossil might be a feathered Pterodactyl (flying reptiles\r\nhaving been often met with in the same stratum), or that it might at\r\nleast supply some connecting links between a reptile and a bird. But\r\nProfessor Owen, in a memoir lately read to the Royal Society (November\r\n20, 1862), has shown that it is unequivocally a bird, and that such of\r\nits characters as are abnormal are by no means strikingly reptilian. The\r\nskeleton was lying on its back when embedded in calcareous sediment, so\r\nthat the ventral part is exposed to view. It is about 1 foot 8 inches\r\nlong, and 1 foot across, from the apex of the right to that of the left\r\nwing. The furculum, or merry-thought, which is entire, marks the fore\r\npart of the trunk; the ischium, scapula, and most of the wing and leg\r\nbones are preserved, and there are impressions of the quill feathers and\r\nof down on the body. The vanes and shafts of the feathers can be seen by\r\nthe naked eye. Fourteen long quill feathers diverge on each side of the\r\nmetacarpal and phalangial bones, and decrease in length from 6 inches\r\nto 1 inch. The wings have a general resemblance to those of gallinaceous\r\nbirds. The tarso-metatarsal, or drumstick, exhibits at its distal end\r\na trifid articular surface supporting three toes, as in birds. The\r\nfurculum, pelvis, and bones of the tail are in their natural position.\r\nThe tail consists of twenty vertebrae, each of which supports a pair of\r\nplumes. The length of the tail with its feathers is 11 1/2 inches, and\r\nits breadth 3 1/2. It is obtusely truncated at the end. In all living\r\nbirds the tail-feathers are arranged in fan-shaped order and attached\r\nto a coccygean bone, consisting of several vertebrae united together,\r\nwhereas in the embryo state these same vertebrae are distinct. The\r\ngreatest number is seen in the ostrich, which has eighteen caudal\r\nvertebrae in the foetal state, which are reduced to nine in the adult\r\nbird, many of them having been anchylosed together. Professor Owen\r\ntherefore considers the tail of the Archaeopteryx as exemplifying the\r\npersistency of what is now an embryonic character. The tail, he\r\nremarks, is essentially a variable organ; there are long-tailed bats\r\nand short-tailed bats, long-tailed rodents and short-tailed rodents,\r\nlong-tailed pterodactyls and short-tailed pterodactyls.\r\n\r\nThe Archaeopteryx differs from all known birds, not only in the\r\nstructure of its tail, but in having two, if not three, digits in the\r\nhand; but there is no trace of the fifth digit of the winged reptile.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which the skeleton occurs are such, says Professor\r\nOwen, as to remind us of the carcass of a gull which has been a prey to\r\nsome Carnivore, which had removed all the soft parts, and perhaps\r\nthe head, nothing being left but the bony legs and the indigestible\r\nquill-feathers. But since Professor Owen's paper was read, Mr. John\r\nEvans, whom I have often had occasion to mention in the earlier chapters\r\nof this work, seems to have found what may indicate a part of the\r\nmissing cranium. He has called our attention to a smooth protuberance\r\non the otherwise even surface of the slab of limestone which seems to\r\nbe the cast of the brain or interior of the skull. Some part even of the\r\ncranial bone itself appears to be still buried in the matrix. Mr. Evans\r\nhas pointed out the resemblance of this cast to one taken by himself\r\nfrom the cranium of a crow, and still more to that of a jay, observing\r\nthat in the fossil the median line which separates the two hemispheres\r\nof the brain is visible.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, we may learn from this valuable relic how rashly the\r\nexistence of Birds at the epoch of the Secondary rocks has been\r\nquestioned, simply on negative evidence, and secondly, how many new\r\nforms may be expected to be brought to light in strata with which we\r\nare already best acquainted, to say nothing of the new formations which\r\ngeologists are continually discovering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 23. -- ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF LANGUAGES AND SPECIES COMPARED\r\n[43].\r\n\r\n  Aryan Hypothesis and Controversy.\r\n  The Races of Mankind change more slowly than their Languages.\r\n  Theory of the gradual Origin of Languages.\r\n  Difficulty of defining what is meant by a Language as distinct\r\n     from a Dialect.\r\n  Great Number of extinct and living Tongues.\r\n  No European Language a Thousand Years old.\r\n  Gaps between Languages, how caused.\r\n  Imperfection of the Record.\r\n  Changes always in Progress.\r\n  Struggle for Existence between rival Terms and Dialects.\r\n  Causes of Selection.\r\n  Each Language formed slowly in a single Geographical Area.\r\n  May die out gradually or suddenly.\r\n  Once lost can never be revived.\r\n  Mode of Origin of Languages and Species a Mystery.\r\n  Speculations as to the Number of original Languages or Species\r\n     unprofitable.\r\n\r\nThe supposed existence, at a remote and unknown period, of a language\r\nconventionally called the Aryan, has of late years been a favourite\r\nsubject of speculation among German philologists, and Professor Max\r\nMuller has given us lately the most improved version of this theory,\r\nand has set forth the various facts and arguments by which it may be\r\ndefended, with his usual perspicuity and eloquence. He observes that if\r\nwe know nothing of the existence of Latin--if all historical documents\r\nprevious to the fifteenth century had been lost--if tradition even was\r\nsilent as to the former existence of a Roman empire, a mere comparison\r\nof the Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Wallachian, and Rhaetian\r\ndialects would enable us to say that at some time there must have been\r\na language from which these six modern dialects derive their origin in\r\ncommon. Without this supposition it would be impossible to account for\r\ntheir structure and composition, as, for example, for the forms of the\r\nauxiliary verb \"to be,\" all evidently varieties of one common type,\r\nwhile it is equally clear that no one of the six affords the original\r\nform from which the others could have been borrowed. So also in none\r\nof the six languages do we find the elements of which these verbal and\r\nother forms could have been composed; they must have been handed down as\r\nrelics from a former period, they must have existed in some antecedent\r\nlanguage, which we know to have been the Latin.\r\n\r\nBut, in like manner, he goes on to show, that Latin itself, as well as\r\nGreek, Sanscrit, Zend (or Bactrian), Lithuanian, old Sclavonic, Gothic,\r\nand Armenian are also eight varieties of one common and more ancient\r\ntype, and no one of them could have been the original from which the\r\nothers were borrowed. They have all such an amount of mutual resemblance\r\nas to point to a more ancient language, the Aryan, which was to them\r\nwhat Latin was to the six Romance languages. The people who spoke this\r\nunknown parent speech, of which so many other ancient tongues were\r\noff-shoots, must have migrated at a remote era to widely separated\r\nregions of the old world, such as Northern Asia, Europe, and India south\r\nof the Himalaya.*\r\n\r\n     (* Max Muller, \"Comparative Mythology\" Oxford Essays 1856.)\r\n\r\nThe soundness of some parts of this Aryan hypothesis has lately been\r\ncalled in question by Mr. Crawfurd, on the ground that the Hindoos,\r\nPersians, Turks, Scandinavians, and other people referred to as having\r\nderived not only words but grammatical forms from an Aryan source,\r\nbelong each of them to a distinct race, and all these races have, it is\r\nsaid, preserved their peculiar characters unaltered from the earliest\r\ndawn of history and tradition. If, therefore, no appreciable change has\r\noccurred in three or four thousand years, we should be obliged to assume\r\na far more remote date for the first branching off of such races from a\r\ncommon stock than the supposed period of the Aryan migrations, and the\r\ndispersion of that language over many and distant countries.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Crawfurd has, I think, himself helped us to remove this\r\nstumbling-block, by admitting that a nation speaking a language allied\r\nto the Sanscrit (the oldest of the eight tongues alluded to), once\r\nprobably inhabited that region situated to the north-west of India,\r\nwhich within the period of authentic history has poured out its\r\nconquering hordes over a great extent of Western Asia and Eastern\r\nEurope. The same people, he says, may have acted the same part in the\r\nlong, dark night which preceded the dawn of tradition.*\r\n\r\n     (* Crawfurd, \"Transactions of the Ethnological Society\"\r\n     volume 1 1861.)\r\n\r\nThese conquerors may have been few in number when compared to the\r\npopulations which they subdued. In such cases the new settlers, although\r\nreckoned by tens of thousands, might merge in a few centuries into the\r\nmillions of subjects which they ruled. It is an acknowledged fact that\r\nthe colour and features of the Negro or European are entirely lost in\r\nthe fourth generation, provided that no fresh infusion of one or\r\nother of the two races takes place. The distinctive physical features,\r\ntherefore, of the Aryan conquerors might soon wear out and be lost in\r\nthose of the nations they overran; yet many of the words, and, what is\r\nmore in point, some of the grammatical forms of their language, might\r\nbe retained by the masses which they had governed for centuries, these\r\nmasses continuing to preserve the same features of race which had\r\ndistinguished them long before the Aryan invasions.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that if we could trace back any set of cognate\r\nlanguages now existing to some common point of departure, they would\r\nconverge and meet sooner in some era of the past than would the existing\r\nraces of mankind; in other words, races change much more slowly than\r\nlanguages. But, according to the doctrine of transmutation, to form a\r\nnew species would take an incomparably longer period than to form a new\r\nrace. No language seems ever to last for a thousand years, whereas\r\nmany a species seems to have endured for hundreds of thousands. A\r\nphilologist, therefore, who is contending that all living languages are\r\nderivative and not primordial, has a great advantage over a naturalist\r\nwho is endeavouring to inculcate a similar theory in regard to species.\r\n\r\nIt may not be uninstructive, in order fairly to appreciate the vast\r\ndifficulty of the task of those who advocate transmutation in natural\r\nhistory, to consider how hard it would be even for a philologist to\r\nsucceed, if he should try to convince an assemblage of intelligent\r\nbut illiterate persons that the language spoken by them, and all those\r\ntalked by contemporary nations, were modern inventions, moreover that\r\nthese same forms of speech were still constantly undergoing change, and\r\nnone of them destined to last for ever.\r\n\r\nWe will suppose him to begin by stating his conviction, that the living\r\nlanguages have been gradually derived from others now extinct, and\r\nspoken by nations which had immediately preceded them in the order of\r\ntime, and that those again had used forms of speech derived from still\r\nolder ones. They might naturally exclaim, \"How strange it is that you\r\nshould find records of a multitude of dead languages, that a part of the\r\nhuman economy which in our own time is so remarkable for its stability,\r\nshould have been so inconstant in bygone ages! We all speak as our\r\nparents and grandparents spoke before us, and so, we are told, do the\r\nGermans and French. What evidence is there of such incessant variation\r\nin remoter times? and, if it be true, why not imagine that when one form\r\nof speech was lost, another was suddenly and supernaturally created by\r\na gift of tongues or confusion of languages, as at the building of\r\nthe Tower of Babel? Where are the memorials of all the intermediate\r\ndialects, which must have existed, if this doctrine of perpetual\r\nfluctuation be true? And how comes it that the tongues now spoken do not\r\npass by insensible gradations the one into the other, and into the dead\r\nlanguages of dates immediately antecedent?\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, if this theory of indefinite modifiability be sound, what\r\nmeaning can be attached to the term language, and what definition can be\r\ngiven of it so as to distinguish a language from a dialect?\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to this last question, the philologist might confess that the\r\nlearned are not agreed as to what constitutes a language as distinct\r\nfrom a dialect. Some believe that there are 4000 living languages,\r\nothers that there are 6000, so that the mode of defining them is clearly\r\na mere matter of opinion. Some contend, for example, that the Danish,\r\nNorwegian, and Swedish form one Scandinavian tongue, others that\r\nthey constitute three different languages, others that the Danish and\r\nNorwegian are one--mere dialects of the same language, but that Swedish\r\nis distinct.\r\n\r\nThe philologist, however, might fairly argue that this very ambiguity\r\nwas greatly in favour of his doctrine, since if languages had all been\r\nconstantly undergoing transmutation, there ought often to be a want of\r\nreal lines of demarcation between them. He might, however, propose that\r\nhe and his pupils should come to an understanding that two languages\r\nshould be regarded as distinct whenever the speakers of them are unable\r\nto converse together, or freely to exchange ideas, whether by word\r\nor writing. Scientifically speaking, such a test might be vague\r\nand unsatisfactory, like the test of species by their capability of\r\nproducing fertile hybrids; but if the pupil is persuaded that there\r\nare such things in nature as distinct languages, whatever may have been\r\ntheir origin, the definition above suggested might be of practical use,\r\nand enable the teacher to proceed with his argument.\r\n\r\nHe might begin by undertaking to prove that none of the languages of\r\nmodern Europe were a thousand years old. No English scholar, he might\r\nsay, who has not specially given himself up to the study of Anglo-Saxon,\r\ncan interpret the documents in which the chronicles and laws of England\r\nwere written in the days of King Alfred, so that we may be sure that\r\nnone of the English of the nineteenth century could converse with the\r\nsubjects of that monarch if these last could now be restored to life.\r\nThe difficulties encountered would not arise merely from the intrusion\r\nof French terms, in consequence of the Norman conquest, because that\r\nlarge portion of our language (including the articles, pronouns, etc.),\r\nwhich is Saxon has also undergone great transformations by abbreviation,\r\nnew modes of pronunciation, spelling, and various corruptions, so as to\r\nbe unlike both ancient and modern German. They who now speak German, if\r\nbrought into contact with their Teutonic ancestors of the ninth century,\r\nwould be quite unable to converse with them, and, in like manner, the\r\nsubjects of Charlemagne could not have exchanged ideas with the Goths of\r\nAlaric's army, or with the soldiers of Arminius in the days of Augustus\r\nCaesar. So rapid indeed has been the change in Germany, that the\r\nepic poem called the Nibelungen Lied, once so popular, and only seven\r\ncenturies old, cannot now be enjoyed, except by the erudite.\r\n\r\nIf we then turn to France, we meet again with similar evidence of\r\nceaseless change. There is a treaty of peace still extant a thousand\r\nyears old, between Charles the Bald and King Louis of Germany (dated\r\nA.D. 841), in which the German king takes an oath in what was the French\r\ntongue of that day, while the French king swears in the German of the\r\nsame era, and neither of these oaths would now convey a distinct meaning\r\nto any but the learned in these two countries. So also in Italy, the\r\nmodern Italian cannot be traced back much beyond the time of Dante, or\r\nsome six centuries before our time. Even in Rome, where there had been\r\nno permanent intrusion of foreigners, such as the Lombard settlers of\r\nGerman origin in the plains of the Po, the common people of the year\r\n1000 spoke quite a distinct language from that of their Roman ancestors\r\nor their Italian descendants, as is shown by the celebrated chronicle\r\nof the monk Benedict, of the convent of St. Andrea on Mount Soracte,\r\nwritten in such barbarous Latin, and with such strange grammatical\r\nforms, that it requires a profoundly skilled linguist to decipher it.*\r\n\r\n     (* See G. Pertz, \"Monumenta Germanica\" volume 3.)\r\n\r\nHaving thus established the preliminary fact, that none of the tongues\r\nnow spoken were in existence ten centuries ago, and that the ancient\r\nlanguages have passed through many a transitional dialect before they\r\nsettled into the forms now in use, the philologist might bring forward\r\nproofs of the great numbers both of lost and living forms of speech.\r\n\r\nStrabo tells us that in his time, in the Caucasus alone (a chain of\r\nmountains not longer than the Alps, and much narrower), there were\r\nspoken at least seventy languages. At the present period the number, it\r\nis said, would be still greater if all the distinct dialects of those\r\nmountains were reckoned. Several of these Caucasian tongues admit of no\r\ncomparison with any known living or lost Asiatic or European language.\r\nOthers which are not peculiar are obsolete forms of known languages,\r\nsuch as the Georgian, Mongolian, Persian, Arabic, and Tartarian. It\r\nseems that as often as conquering hordes swept over that part of Asia,\r\nalways coming from the north and east, they drove before them the\r\ninhabitants of the plains, who took refuge in some of the retired\r\nvalleys and high mountain fastnesses, where they maintained their\r\nindependence, as do the Circassians in our time in spite of the power of\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nIn the Himalayan Mountains, from Assam to its extreme north-western\r\nlimit, and generally in the more hilly parts of British India, the\r\ndiversity of languages is surprisingly great, impeding the advance of\r\ncivilisation and the labours of the missionary. In South America and\r\nMexico, Alexander Humboldt reckoned the distinct tongues by hundreds,\r\nand those of Africa are said to be equally numerous. Even in China, some\r\neighteen provincial dialects prevail, almost all deviating so much from\r\nothers that the speakers are not mutually intelligible, and besides\r\nthese there are other distinct forms of speech in the mountains of the\r\nsame empire.\r\n\r\nThe philologist might next proceed to point out that the geographical\r\nrelations of living and dead languages favour the hypothesis of the\r\nliving ones having been derived from the extinct, in spite of our\r\ninability, in most instances, to adduce documentary evidence of the\r\nfact or to discover monuments of all the intermediate and transitional\r\ndialects which must have existed. Thus he would observe that the modern\r\nRomance languages are spoken exactly where the ancient Romans once lived\r\nor ruled, and the Greek of our days where the older classical Greek was\r\nformerly spoken. Exceptions to this rule might be detected, but they\r\nwould be explicable by reference to colonisation and conquest.\r\n\r\nAs to the many and wide gaps sometimes encountered between the dead and\r\nliving languages, we must remember that it is not part of the plan of\r\nany people to preserve memorials of their forms of speech expressly for\r\nthe edification of posterity. Their manuscripts and inscriptions serve\r\nsome present purpose, are occasional and imperfect from the first,\r\nand are rendered more fragmentary in the course of time, some being\r\nintentionally destroyed, others lost by the decay of the perishable\r\nmaterials on which they are written; so that to question the theory of\r\nall known languages being derivative on the ground that we can rarely\r\ntrace a passage from the ancient to the modern through all the dialects\r\nwhich must have flourished one after the other in the intermediate ages,\r\nimplies a want of reflection on the laws which govern the recording as\r\nwell as the obliterating processes.\r\n\r\nBut another important question still remains to be considered, namely,\r\nwhether the trifling changes which can alone be witnessed by a single\r\ngeneration, can possibly represent the working of that machinery\r\nwhich, in the course of many centuries, has given rise to such mighty\r\nrevolutions in the forms of speech throughout the world. Everyone\r\nmay have noticed in his own lifetime the stealing in of some slight\r\nalterations of accent, pronunciation or spelling, or the introduction of\r\nsome words borrowed from a foreign language to express ideas of which no\r\nnative term precisely conveyed the import. He may also remember hearing\r\nfor the first time some cant terms or slang phrases, which have since\r\nforced their way into common use, in spite of the efforts of the purist.\r\nBut he may still contend that \"within the range of his experience,\" his\r\nlanguage has continued unchanged, and he may believe in its immutability\r\nin spite of minor variations. The real question, however, at issue\r\nis, whether there are any limits to this variability. He will find on\r\nfarther investigation, that new technical terms are coined almost daily\r\nin various arts, sciences, professions, and trades, that new names must\r\nbe found for new inventions, that many of these acquire a metaphorical\r\nsense, and then make their way into general circulation, as\r\n\"stereotyped,\" for instance, which would have been as meaningless to the\r\nmen of the seventeenth century as would the new terms and images derived\r\nfrom steamboat and railway travelling to the men of the eighteenth.\r\n\r\nIf the numerous words, idioms, and phrases, many of them of ephemeral\r\nduration, which are thus invented by the young and old in various\r\nclasses of society, in the nursery, the school, the camp, the fleet, the\r\ncourts of law and the study of the man of science or literature, could\r\nall be collected together and put on record, their number in one or\r\ntwo centuries might compare with the entire permanent vocabulary of the\r\nlanguage. It becomes, therefore, a curious subject of inquiry, what are\r\nthe laws which govern not only the invention, but also the \"selection\"\r\nof some of these words or idioms, giving them currency in preference to\r\nothers?--for as the powers of the human memory are limited, a check must\r\nbe found to the endless increase and multiplication of terms, and\r\nold words must be dropped nearly as fast as new ones are put into\r\ncirculation. Sometimes the new word or phrase, or a modification of\r\nthe old ones, will entirely supplant the more ancient expressions, or,\r\ninstead of the latter being discarded, both may flourish together, the\r\nolder one having a more restricted use.\r\n\r\nAlthough the speakers may be unconscious that any great fluctuation is\r\ngoing on in their language--although when we observe the manner in which\r\nnew words and phrases are thrown out, as if at random or in sport, while\r\nothers get into vogue, we may think the process of change to be the\r\nresult of mere chance--there are nevertheless fixed laws in action, by\r\nwhich, in the general struggle for existence, some terms and dialects\r\ngain the victory over others. The slightest advantage attached to some\r\nnew mode of pronouncing or spelling, from considerations of brevity or\r\neuphony, may turn the scale, or more powerful causes of selection may\r\ndecide which of two or more rivals shall triumph and which succumb.\r\nAmong these are fashion, or the influence of an aristocracy, whether of\r\nbirth or education, popular writers, orators, preachers--a centralised\r\ngovernment organising its schools expressly to promote uniformity of\r\ndiction, and to get the better of provincialisms and local dialects.\r\nBetween these dialects, which may be regarded as so many \"incipient\r\nlanguages,\" the competition is always keenest when they are most nearly\r\nallied, and the extinction of any one of them destroys some of the links\r\nby which a dominant tongue may have been previously connected with\r\nsome other widely distinct one. It is by the perpetual loss of such\r\nintermediate forms of speech that the great dissimilarity of the\r\nlanguages which survive is brought about. Thus, if Dutch should become a\r\ndead language, English and German would be separated by a wider gap.\r\n\r\nSome languages which are spoken by millions, and spread over a wide\r\narea, will endure much longer than others which have never had a wide\r\nrange, especially if the tendency to incessant change in one of these\r\ndominant tongues is arrested for a time by a standard literature.\r\nBut even this source of stability is insecure, for popular writers\r\nthemselves are great innovators, sometimes coining new words, and\r\nstill oftener new expressions and idioms, to embody their own original\r\nconceptions and sentiments, or some peculiar modes of thought and\r\nfeeling characteristic of their age. Even when a language is regarded\r\nwith superstitious veneration as the vehicle of divine truths and\r\nreligious precepts, and which has prevailed for many generations, it\r\nwill be incapable of permanently maintaining its ground. Hebrew had\r\nceased to be a living language before the Christian era. Sanscrit, the\r\nsacred language of the Hindoos, shared the same fate, in spite of the\r\nveneration in which the Vedas are still held, and in spite of many a\r\nSanscrit poem once popular and national.\r\n\r\nThe Christians of Constantinople and the Morea still hear the New\r\nTestament and their liturgy read in ancient Greek, while they speak a\r\ndialect in which Paul might have preached in vain at Athens. So in\r\nthe Catholic Church, the Italians pray in one tongue and talk another.\r\nLuther's translation of the Bible acted as a powerful cause of\r\n\"selection,\" giving at once to one of many competing dialects (that of\r\nSaxony) a prominent and dominant position in Germany; but the style\r\nof Luther has, like that of our English Bible, already become somewhat\r\nantiquated.\r\n\r\nIf the doctrine of gradual transmutation be applicable to languages, all\r\nthose spoken in historical times must each of them have had a\r\nclosely allied prototype; and accordingly, whenever we can thoroughly\r\ninvestigate their history, we find in them some internal evidence of\r\nsuccessive additions by the invention of new words or the modification\r\nof old ones. Proofs also of borrowing are discernible, letters being\r\nretained in the spelling of some words which have no longer any meaning\r\nas they are now pronounced--no connection with any corresponding sounds.\r\nSuch redundant or silent letters, once useful in the parent speech,\r\nhave been aptly compared by Mr. Darwin to rudimentary organs in living\r\nbeings, which, as he interprets them, have at some former period been\r\nmore fully developed, having had their proper functions to perform in\r\nthe organisation of a remote progenitor.\r\n\r\nIf all known languages are derivative and not primordial creations, they\r\nmust each of them have been slowly elaborated in a single geographical\r\narea. No one of them can have had two birthplaces. If one were carried\r\nby a colony to a distant region, it would immediately begin to vary\r\nunless frequent intercourse was kept up with the mother country. The\r\ndescendants of the same stock, if perfectly isolated, would in five or\r\nsix centuries, perhaps sooner, be quite unable to converse with those\r\nwho remained at home, or with those who may have migrated to some\r\ndistant region, where they were shut out from all communication with\r\nothers speaking the same tongue.\r\n\r\nA Norwegian colony which settled in Iceland in the ninth century,\r\nmaintained its independence for about 400 years, during which time the\r\nold Gothic which they at first spoke became corrupted and considerably\r\nmodified. In the meantime the natives of Norway, who had enjoyed much\r\ncommercial intercourse with the rest of Europe, acquired quite a new\r\nspeech, and looked on the Icelandic as having been stationary, and\r\nas representing the pure Gothic original of which their own was an\r\noffshoot.\r\n\r\nA German colony in Pennsylvania was cut off from frequent communication\r\nwith Europe for about a quarter of a century, during the wars of the\r\nFrench Revolution between 1792 and 1815. So marked had been the effect\r\neven of this brief and imperfect isolation, that when Prince Bernhard of\r\nSaxe-Weimar travelled among them a few years after the peace, he found\r\nthe peasants speaking as they had done in Germany in the preceding\r\ncentury,*) and retaining a dialect which at home had already become\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Travels of Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, in North\r\n     America, in 1825 and 1826\", page 123.)\r\n\r\nEven after the renewal of the German emigration from Europe, when I\r\ntravelled in 1841 among the same people in the retired valleys of the\r\nAlleghenies, I found the newspapers full of terms half English and\r\nhalf German, and many an Anglo-Saxon word, which had assumed a Teutonic\r\ndress, as \"fencen,\" to fence, instead of umzaunen, \"flauer\" for flour,\r\ninstead of mehl, and so on. What with the retention of terms no longer\r\nin use in the mother country, and the borrowing of new ones from\r\nneighbouring states, there might have arisen in Pennsylvania in five or\r\nsix generations, but for the influx of newcomers from Germany, a mongrel\r\nspeech equally unintelligible to the Anglo-Saxon and to the inhabitants\r\nof the European fatherland.\r\n\r\nIf languages resemble species in having had each their \"specific centre\"\r\nor single area of creation, in which they have been slowly formed, so\r\neach of them is alike liable to slow or to sudden extinction. They may\r\ndie out very gradually in consequence of transmutation, or abruptly by\r\nthe extermination of the last surviving representatives of the unaltered\r\ntype. We know in what century the last Dodo perished, and we know\r\nthat in the seventeenth century the language of the Red Indians of\r\nMassachusetts, into which Father Eliot had translated the Bible, and\r\nin which Christianity was preached for several generations, ceased to\r\nexist, the last individuals by whom it was spoken having at that period\r\ndied without issue.*\r\n\r\n     (* Lyell, \"Travels in North America\" volume 1 page 260\r\n     1845.)\r\n\r\nBut if just before that event the white man had retreated from the\r\ncontinent, or had been swept off by an epidemic, those Indians might\r\nsoon have repeopled the wilderness, and their copious vocabulary\r\nand peculiar forms of expression might have lasted without important\r\nmodification to this day. The extinction, however, of languages in\r\ngeneral is not abrupt, any more than that of species. It will also be\r\nevident from what has been said, that a language which has once died out\r\ncan never be revived, since the same assemblage of conditions can never\r\nbe restored even among the descendants of the same stock, much less\r\nsimultaneously among all the rounding nations with whom they may be in\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nWe may compare the persistency of languages, or the tendency of each\r\ngeneration to adopt without change the vocabulary of its predecessor,\r\nto the force of inheritance in the organic world, which causes the\r\noffspring to resemble its parents. The inventive power which coins new\r\nwords or modifies old ones, and adapts them to new wants and conditions\r\nas often as these arise, answers to the variety-making power in the\r\nanimate creation.\r\n\r\nProgressive improvement in language is a necessary consequence of\r\nthe progress of the human mind from one generation to another. As\r\ncivilisation advances, a greater number of terms are required to express\r\nabstract ideas, and words previously used in a vague sense, so long\r\nas the state of society was rude and barbarous, gradually acquire more\r\nprecise and definite meanings, in consequence of which several terms\r\nmust be employed to express ideas and things, which a single word had\r\nbefore signified, though somewhat loosely and imperfectly.\r\n\r\nThe farther this subdivision of function is carried, the more complete\r\nand perfect the language becomes, just as species of higher grade have\r\nspecial organs, such as eyes, lungs, and stomach, for seeing, breathing,\r\nand digesting, which in simple organisms are all performed by one and\r\nthe same part of the body.*\r\n\r\n     (* See Herbert Spencer's \"Psychology\" and \"Scientific\r\n     Essays.\")\r\n\r\nWhen we had satisfied ourselves that all the existing languages, instead\r\nof being primordial creations, or the direct gifts of a supernatural\r\nPower, have been slowly elaborated, partly by the modification of\r\npre-existing dialects, partly by borrowing terms at successive periods\r\nfrom numerous foreign sources, and partly by new inventions made some of\r\nthem deliberately, and some casually and as it were fortuitously--when\r\nwe have discovered the principal causes of selection, which have guided\r\nthe adoption or rejection of rival names for the same things and ideas,\r\nrival modes of pronouncing the same words and provincial dialects\r\ncompeting one with another--we are still very far from comprehending all\r\nthe laws which have governed the formation of each language.\r\n\r\nIt was a profound saying of William Humboldt, that \"Man is Man only by\r\nmeans of speech, but in order to invent speech he must be already Man.\"\r\nOther animals may be able to utter sounds more articulate and as varied\r\nas the click of the Bushman, but voice alone can never enable brute\r\nintelligence to acquire language.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the complexity of every form of speech spoken by a\r\nhighly civilised nation, and discover that the grammatical rules and\r\nthe inflections which denote number, time, and equality are usually the\r\nproduct of a rude state of society--that the savage and the sage, the\r\npeasant and man of letters, the child and the philosopher, have worked\r\ntogether, in the course of many generations, to build up a fabric\r\nwhich has been truly described as a wonderful instrument of thought, a\r\nmachine, the several parts of which are so well adjusted to each other\r\nas to resemble the product of one period and of a single mind--we cannot\r\nbut look upon the result as a profound mystery, and one of which the\r\nseparate builders have been almost as unconscious as are the bees in\r\na hive of the architectural skill and mathematical knowledge which is\r\ndisplayed in the construction of the honeycomb.\r\n\r\nIn our attempts to account for the origin of species, we find ourselves\r\nstill sooner brought face to face with the working of a law of\r\ndevelopment of so high an order as to stand nearly in the same relation\r\nas the Deity himself to man's finite understanding, a law capable of\r\nadding new and powerful causes, such as the moral and intellectual\r\nfaculties of the human race, to a system of nature which had gone on for\r\nmillions of years without the intervention of any analogous cause. If we\r\nconfound \"Variation\" or \"Natural Selection\" with such creational laws,\r\nwe deify secondary causes or immeasurably exaggerate their influence.\r\n\r\nYet we ought by no means to undervalue the importance of the step which\r\nwill have been made, should it hereafter become the generally received\r\nopinion of men of science (as I fully expect it will), that the past\r\nchanges of the organic world have been brought about by the subordinate\r\nagency of such causes as \"Variation\" and \"Natural Selection.\" All our\r\nadvances in the knowledge of Nature have consisted of such steps as\r\nthese, and we must not be discouraged because greater mysteries remain\r\nbehind wholly inscrutable to us.\r\n\r\nIf the philologist is asked whether in the beginning of things there\r\nwas one or five, or a greater number of languages, he may answer that,\r\nbefore he can reply to such a question, it must be decided whether the\r\norigin of Man was single, or whether there were many primordial races.\r\nBut he may also observe, that if mankind began their career in a rude\r\nstate of society, their whole vocabulary would be limited to a\r\nfew words, and that if they then separated into several isolated\r\ncommunities, each of these would soon acquire an entirely distinct\r\nlanguage, some roots being lost and others corrupted and transformed\r\nbeyond the possibility of subsequent identification, so that it might\r\nbe hopeless to expect to trace back the living and dead languages to one\r\nstarting point, even if that point were of much more modern date than\r\nwe have now good reason to suppose. In like manner it may be said of\r\nspecies, that if those first formed were of very simple structure, and\r\nthey began to vary and to lose some organs by disuse and acquire\r\nnew ones by development, they might soon differ as much as so many\r\ndistinctly created primordial types. It would therefore be a waste of\r\ntime to speculate on the number of original monads or germs from which\r\nall plants and animals were subsequently evolved, more especially as the\r\noldest fossiliferous strata known to us may be the last of a long series\r\nof antecedent formations, which once contained organic remains. It was\r\nnot till geologists ceased to discuss the condition of the original\r\nnucleus of the planet, whether it was solid or fluid, and whether it\r\nowed its fluidity to aqueous or igneous causes, that they began to\r\nachieve their great triumphs; and the vast progress which has recently\r\nbeen made in showing how the living species may be connected with the\r\nextinct by a common bond of descent, has been due to a more careful\r\nstudy of the actual state of the living world, and to those monuments of\r\nthe past in which the relics of the animate creation of former ages are\r\nbest preserved and least mutilated by the hand of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 24. -- BEARING OF THE DOCTRINE OF TRANSMUTATION ON THE ORIGIN OF\r\nMAN, AND HIS PLACE IN THE CREATION.\r\n\r\n  Whether Man can be regarded as an Exception to the Rule if the\r\n     Doctrine of Transmutation be embraced for the rest of the\r\n     Animal Kingdom.\r\n  Zoological Relations of Man to other Mammalia.\r\n  Systems of Classification.\r\n  Term Quadrumanous, why deceptive.\r\n  Whether the Structure of the Human Brain entitles Man to form a\r\n     distinct Sub-class of the Mammalia.\r\n  Intelligence of the lower Animals compared to the Intellect and\r\n     Reason of Man.\r\n  Grounds on which Man has been referred to a distinct Kingdom of\r\n     Nature.\r\n  Immaterial Principle common to Man and Animals.\r\n  Non-discovery of intermediate Links among Fossil Anthropomorphous\r\n     Species.\r\n  Hallam on the compound Nature of Man, and his Place in the Creation.\r\n  Great Inequality of mental Endowment in different Human Races\r\n     and Individuals developed by Variation and ordinary Generation.\r\n  How far a corresponding Divergence in physical Structure may result\r\n     from the Working of the same Causes.\r\n  Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\nSome of the opponents of transmutation, who are well versed in Natural\r\nHistory, admit that though that doctrine is untenable, it is not\r\nwithout its practical advantages as a \"useful working hypothesis,\" often\r\nsuggesting good experiments and observations and aiding us to retain in\r\nthe memory a multitude of facts respecting the geographical distribution\r\nof genera and species, both of animals and plants, the succession in\r\ntime of organic remains, and many other phenomena which, but for such a\r\ntheory, would be wholly without a common bond of relationship.\r\n\r\nIt is in fact conceded by many eminent zoologists and botanists, as\r\nbefore explained, that whatever may be the nature of the species-making\r\npower or law, its effects are of such a character as to imitate the\r\nresults which variation, guided by natural selection, would produce,\r\nif only we could assume with certainty that there are no limits to the\r\nvariability of species. But as the anti-transmutationists are persuaded\r\nthat such limits do exist, they regard the hypothesis as simply a\r\nprovisional one, and expect that it will one day be superseded by\r\nanother cognate theory, which will not require us to assume the former\r\ncontinuousness of the links which have connected the past and present\r\nstates of the organic world, or the outgoing with the incoming species.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, many of those who hesitate to give in their full\r\nadhesion to the doctrine of progression, the other twin branch of the\r\ndevelopment theory, and who even object to it, as frequently tending to\r\nretard the reception of new facts supposed to militate against opinions\r\nsolely founded on negative evidence, are nevertheless agreed that on\r\nthe whole it is of great service in guiding our speculations. Indeed it\r\ncannot be denied that a theory which establishes a connection between\r\nthe absence of all relics of vertebrata in the oldest fossiliferous\r\nrocks, and the presence of man's remains in the newest, which affords a\r\nmore than plausible explanation of the successive appearance in strata\r\nof intermediate age of the fish, reptile, bird, and mammal, has no\r\nordinary claims to our favour as comprehending the largest number of\r\npositive and negative facts gathered from all parts of the globe, and\r\nextending over countless ages, that science has perhaps ever attempted\r\nto embrace in one grand generalisation.\r\n\r\nBut will not transmutation, if adopted, require us to include the human\r\nrace in the same continuous series of developments, so that we must hold\r\nthat Man himself has been derived by an unbroken line of descent from\r\nsome one of the inferior animals? We certainly cannot escape from such\r\na conclusion without abandoning many of the weightiest arguments which\r\nhave been urged in support of variation and natural selection considered\r\nas the subordinate causes by which new types have been gradually\r\nintroduced into the earth. Many of the gaps which separate the most\r\nnearly allied genera and orders of mammalia are, in a physical point of\r\nview, as wide as those which divide Man from the mammalia most nearly\r\nakin to him, and the extent of his isolation, whether we regard his\r\nwhole nature or simply his corporeal attributes, must be considered\r\nbefore we can discuss the bearing of transmutation upon his origin and\r\nplace in the creation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMS OF CLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\nIn order to qualify ourselves to judge of the degree of affinity in\r\nphysical organisation between Man and the lower animals, we cannot\r\ndo better than study those systems of classification which have been\r\nproposed by the most eminent teachers of natural history. Of these an\r\nelaborate and faithful summary has recently been drawn up by the late\r\nIsidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire, which the reader will do well to consult.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Histoire Naturale Generale des Regnes organiques\" Paris\r\n     volume 2 1856.)\r\n\r\nHe begins by passing in review numerous schemes of classification, each\r\nof them having some merit, and most of them having been invented with a\r\nview of assigning to Man a separate place in the system of Nature, as,\r\nfor example, by dividing animals into rational and irrational, or the\r\nwhole organic world into three kingdoms, the human, the animal, and the\r\nvegetable--an arrangement defended on the ground that Man is raised\r\nas much by his intelligence above the animals as are these by their\r\nsensibility above plants. Admitting that these schemes are not\r\nunphilosophical, as duly recognising the double nature of Man (his moral\r\nand intellectual, as well as his physical attributes), Isidore G. St.\r\nHilaire observes that little knowledge has been imparted by them. We\r\nhave gained, he says, much more from those masters of the science who\r\nhave not attempted any compromise between two distinct orders of ideas,\r\nthe physical and psychological, and who have confined their attention\r\nstrictly to Man's physical relation to the lower animals.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus led the way in this field of inquiry by comparing Man and the\r\napes, in the same manner as he compared these last with the carnivores,\r\nruminants, rodents, or any other division of warm-blooded quadrupeds.\r\nAfter several modifications of his original scheme, he ended by placing\r\nMan as one of the many genera in his order Primates, which embraced not\r\nonly the apes and lemurs, but the bats also, as he found these last to\r\nbe nearly allied to some of the lowest forms of the monkeys. But all\r\nmodern naturalists, who retain the order Primates, agree to exclude from\r\nit the bats or Cheiroptera; and most of them class Man as one of\r\nseveral families of the order Primates. In this, as in most systems\r\nof classification, the families of modern zoologists and botanists\r\ncorrespond with the genera of Linnaeus.\r\n\r\nBlumenbach, in 1779, proposed to deviate from this course, and to\r\nseparate Man from the apes as an order apart, under the name of Bimana,\r\nor two-handed. In making this innovation he seems at first to have\r\nfelt that it could not be justified without calling in psychological\r\nconsiderations to his aid, to strengthen those which were purely\r\nanatomical; for, in the earliest edition of his \"Manual of Natural\r\nHistory,\" he defined Man to be \"animal rationale, loquens, erectum,\r\nbimanum,\" whereas in later editions he restricted himself entirely to\r\nthe two last characters, namely, the erect position and the two hands,\r\nor \"animal erectum, bimanum.\"\r\n\r\nThe terms \"bimanous\" and \"quadrumanous\" had been already employed by\r\nBuffon in 1766, but not applied in a strict zoological classification\r\ntill so used by Blumenbach. Twelve years later, Cuvier adopted the same\r\norder Bimana for the human family, while the apes, monkeys, and lemurs\r\nconstituted a separate order called Quadrumana.\r\n\r\nRespecting this last innovation, Isidore G. St. Hilaire asks, \"How could\r\nsuch a division stand, repudiated as it was by the anthropologists in\r\nthe name of the moral and intellectual supremacy of Man; and by the\r\nzoologists, on the ground of its incompatibility with natural affinities\r\nand with the true principles of classification? Separated as a group of\r\nordinal value, placed at the same distance from the ape as the latter\r\nfrom the carnivore, Man is at once too near and too distant from\r\nthe higher mammalia--too near if we take into account those elevated\r\nfaculties, which, raising Man above all other organised beings, accord\r\nto him not only the first, but a separate place in the creation--too far\r\nif we merely consider the organic affinities which unite him with the\r\nquadrumana; with the apes especially, which, in a purely physical point\r\nof view, approach Man more nearly than they do the lemurs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, is this order of Bimana of Blumenbach and Cuvier? An\r\nimpracticable compromise between two opposite and irreconcilable\r\nsystems--between two orders of ideas which are clearly expressed in the\r\nlanguage of natural history by these two words: the human KINGDOM and\r\nthe human FAMILY. It is one of those would-be via media propositions\r\nwhich, once seen through, satisfy no one, precisely because they\r\nare intended to please everybody; half-truths, perhaps, but also\r\nhalf-falsehoods; for what, in science, is a half-truth but an error?\"\r\n\r\nIsidore G. St. Hilaire then proceeds to show how, in spite of the\r\ngreat authority of Blumenbach and Cuvier, a large proportion of modern\r\nzoologists of note have rejected the order Bimana, and have regarded Man\r\nsimply as a family of one and the same order, Primates.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERM \"QUADRUMANOUS,\" WHY DECEPTIVE.\r\n\r\nEven the term \"Quadrumanous\" has lately been shown by Professor Huxley,\r\nin a lecture delivered by him in the spring of 1860-61, which I had\r\nthe good fortune to hear, to have proved a fertile source of popular\r\ndelusion, conveying ideas which the great anatomists Blumenbach and\r\nCuvier never entertained themselves, namely, that in the so-called\r\nQuadrumana the extremities of the hind-limbs bear a real resemblance to\r\nthe human hands, instead of corresponding anatomically with the human\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nAs this subject bears very directly on the question, how far Man is\r\nentitled, in a purely zoological classification, to rank as an order\r\napart, I shall proceed to cite, in an abridged form, the words of the\r\nlecturer above alluded to.*\r\n\r\n     (* Professor Huxley's third lecture \"On the Motor Organs of\r\n     Man compared with those of other Animals,\" delivered in the\r\n     Royal School of Mines, in Jermyn Street (March 1861) has\r\n     been embodied with the rest of the course in his work\r\n     entitled \"Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature.\")\r\n\r\n\"To gain,\" he observes, \"a precise conception of the resemblances and\r\ndifferences of the hand and foot, and of the distinctive characters of\r\neach, we must look below the skin, and compare the bony framework and\r\nits motor apparatus in each.\r\n\r\n\"The foot of Man is distinguished from his hand by:--\r\n\r\n\"1. The arrangement of the tarsal bones.\r\n\r\n\"2. By having a short flexor and a short extensor muscle of the digits.\r\n\r\n\"3. By possessing the muscle termed peronaeus longus.\r\n\r\n\"And if we desire to ascertain whether the terminal division of a limb\r\nin other animals is to be called a foot or a hand, it is by the presence\r\nor absence of these characters that we must be guided, and not by the\r\nmere proportions, and greater or lesser mobility of the great toe,\r\nwhich may vary indefinitely without any fundamental alteration in the\r\nstructure of the foot. Keeping these considerations in mind, let us now\r\nturn to the limbs of the Gorilla. The terminal division of the fore-limb\r\npresents no difficulty--bone for bone, and muscle for muscle, are found\r\nto be arranged precisely as in Man, or with such minute differences as\r\nare found as varieties in Man. The Gorilla's hand is clumsier, heavier,\r\nand has a thumb somewhat shorter in proportion than that of Man; but no\r\none has ever doubted its being a true hand.\r\n\r\n\"At first sight, the termination of the hind-limb of the Gorilla looks\r\nvery hand-like, and as it is still more so in the lower apes, it is not\r\nwonderful that the appellation 'Quadrumana,' or four-handed creatures,\r\nadopted from the older anatomists by Blumenbach, and unfortunately\r\nrendered current by Cuvier, should have gained such wide acceptance as a\r\nname for the ape order. But the most cursory anatomical investigation at\r\nonce proves that the resemblance of the so-called 'hindhand' to a\r\ntrue hand is only skin deep, and that, in all essential respects, the\r\nhind-limb of the Gorilla is as truly terminated by a foot as that\r\nof Man. The tarsal bones, in all important circumstances of number,\r\ndisposition, and form, resemble those of Man. The metatarsals and\r\ndigits, on the other hand, are proportionally longer and more slender,\r\nwhile the great toe is not only proportionally shorter and weaker,\r\nbut its metatarsal bone is united by a far more movable joint with the\r\ntarsus. At the same time, the foot is set more obliquely upon the leg\r\nthan in Man.\r\n\r\n\"As to the muscles, there is a short flexor, a short extensor, and a\r\nperonaeus longus, while the tendons of the long flexors of the great toe\r\nand of the other toes are united together and into an accessory fleshy\r\nbundle.\r\n\r\n\"The hind-limb of the Gorilla, therefore, ends in a true foot with a\r\nvery movable great toe. It is a prehensile foot, if you will, but is\r\nin no sense a hand: it is a foot which differs from that of Man in no\r\nfundamental character, but in mere proportions--degree of mobility--and\r\nsecondary arrangement of its parts.\r\n\r\n\"It must not be supposed, however, that because I speak of these\r\ndifferences as not fundamental, that I wish to underrate their value.\r\nThey are important enough in their way, the structure of the foot being\r\nin strict correlation with that of the rest of the organism; but after\r\nall, regarded anatomically, the resemblances between the foot of Man\r\nand the foot of the Gorilla are far more striking and important than the\r\ndifferences.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Professor Huxley, ibid.)\r\n\r\nAfter dwelling on some points of anatomical detail, highly\r\nimportant, but for which I have not space here, the Professor\r\ncontinues--\"Throughout all these modifications, it must be recollected\r\nthat the foot loses no one of its essential characters. Every monkey and\r\nlemur exhibits the characteristic arrangement of tarsal bones, possesses\r\na short flexor and short extensor muscle, and a peronaeus longus. Varied\r\nas the proportions and appearance of the organ may be, the terminal\r\ndivision of the hind-limb remains in plan and principle of construction\r\na foot, and never in the least degree approaches a hand.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Ibid.)\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Professor Huxley rejects the term \"Quadrumana,\" as\r\nleading to serious misconception, and regards Man as one of the families\r\nof the Primates. This method of classification he shows to be equally\r\nborne out by an appeal to another character on which so much reliance\r\nhas always been placed in classification, as affording in the mammalia\r\nthe most trustworthy indications of affinity, namely, the dentition.\r\n\r\n\"The number of teeth in the Gorilla and all the Old World monkeys,\r\nexcept the lemurs, is thirty-two, the same as in Man, and the general\r\npattern of their crowns the same. But besides other distinctions, the\r\ncanines in all but Man project in the upper or lower jaws almost like\r\ntusks. But all the American apes have four more teeth in their permanent\r\nset, or thirty-six in all, so that they differ in this respect more from\r\nthe Old World apes than do these last from Man.\"\r\n\r\nIf therefore, by reference to this character, we place Man in a separate\r\norder, we must make several orders for the apes, monkeys, and lemurs,\r\nand so, in regard to the structure of the hands and feet before alluded\r\nto, \"the Gorilla differs far more from some of the quadrumana than he\r\ndiffers from Man.\" Indeed, Professor Huxley contends that there is more\r\ndifference between the hand and foot of the Gorilla and those of the\r\nOrang, one of the anthropomorphous apes, than between those of the\r\nGorilla and Man, for \"the thumb of the Orang differs by its shortness\r\nand by the absence of any special long flexor muscle from that of the\r\nGorilla more than it differs from that of Man.\" The carpus also of the\r\nOrang, like that of most lower apes, contains nine bones, while in the\r\nGorilla, as in Man and the Chimpanzee, there are only eight.\" Other\r\ncharacters are also given to show that the Orang's foot separates it\r\nmore widely from the Gorilla than that of the Gorilla separates that ape\r\nfrom Man. In some of the lower apes, the divergence from the human\r\ntype of hand and foot, as well as from those of the Gorilla, is still\r\ngreater, as, for example, in the spider-monkey and marmoset.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Huxley, ibid. page 29.)\r\n\r\nIf the muscles, viscera, or any other part of the animal fabric,\r\nincluding the brain, be compared, the results are declared to be\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\nWHETHER THE STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN BRAIN ENTITLES MAN TO FORM A DISTINCT\r\nSUB-CLASS OF THE MAMMALIA.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these and many other zoological considerations, the\r\norder Bimana had already been declared, in 1856, by Isidore G. St.\r\nHilaire in his history of the science above quoted \"to have become\r\nobsolete,\" even though sanctioned by the great names of Blumenbach and\r\nCuvier. But in opposition to the new views Professor Owen announced, the\r\nyear after the publication of G. St. Hilaire's work, that he had been\r\nled by purely anatomical considerations to separate Man from the other\r\nPrimates and from the mammalia generally as a distinct SUB-CLASS, thus\r\ndeparting farther from the classification of Blumenbach and Cuvier than\r\nthey had ventured to do from that of Linnaeus.\r\n\r\nThe proposed innovation was based chiefly on three cerebral characters\r\nbelonging, it was alleged, exclusively to Man and thus described in the\r\nfollowing passages of a memoir communicated to the Linnaean Society in\r\n1857, in which all the mammalia were divided, according to the structure\r\nof the brain, into four sub-classes, represented by the kangaroo, the\r\nbeaver, the ape, and Man respectively:--\r\n\r\n\"In Man, the brain presents an ascensive step in development, higher\r\nand more strongly marked than that by which the preceding sub-class\r\nwas distinguished from the one below it. Not only do the cerebral\r\nhemispheres overlap the olfactory lobes and cerebellum, but they extend\r\nin advance of the one and farther back than the other. Their posterior\r\ndevelopment is so marked that anatomists have assigned to that part the\r\ncharacter of a third lobe; it is peculiar to the genus Homo, and equally\r\npeculiar is the 'posterior horn of the lateral ventricle' and\r\nthe 'hippocampus minor' which characterises the hind-lobe of each\r\nhemisphere. The superficial grey matter of the cerebrum, through the\r\nnumber and depth of its convolutions, attains its maximum of extent in\r\nMan.\r\n\r\n\"Peculiar mental powers are associated with this highest form of brain,\r\nand their consequences wonderfully illustrate the value of the cerebral\r\ncharacter; according to my estimate of which I am led to regard the\r\ngenus Homo as not merely a representative of a distinct order, but of\r\na distinct sub-class of the mammalia, for which I propose the name of\r\n'Archencephala.'\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Owen, \"Proceedings of the Linnaean Society\" London volume\r\n     8 page 20.)\r\n\r\nThe above definition is accompanied in the same memoir by the following\r\nnote:--\"Not being able to appreciate, or conceive, of the distinction\r\nbetween the psychical phenomena of a chimpanzee and of a Boschisman,\r\nor of an Aztec with arrested brain-growth, as being of a nature so\r\nessential as to preclude a comparison between them, or as being other\r\nthan a difference of degree, I cannot shut my eyes to the significance\r\nof that all-pervading similitude of structure--every tooth, every bone,\r\nstrictly homologous--which makes the determination of the difference\r\nbetween Homo and Pithecus the anatomist's difficulty; and therefore,\r\nwith every respect for the author of the Records of Creation,* I follow\r\nLinnaeus and Cuvier in regarding mankind as a legitimate subject of\r\nzoological comparison and classification.\"\r\n\r\n     (* The late Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Sumner.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 54, 55 and 56.

Fissure of Sylvius.)\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the difference between the human and Simian brain,\r\nProfessor Owen gave figures of the negro's brain as represented by\r\nTiedemann, an original one of a South American monkey, Midas rufimanus,\r\nand one of the chimpanzee (Figure 54), from a memoir published in 1849\r\nby MM. Schroeder van der Kolk and M. Vrolik.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Comptes rendus de l'Academie Royale des Sciences\"\r\n     Amsterdam volume 13.)\r\n\r\nThe selection of Figure 54 was most unfortunate, for three years before,\r\nM. Gratiolet, the highest authority in cerebral anatomy of our age, had,\r\nin his splendid work on \"The Convolutions of the Brain in Man and\r\nthe Primates\" (Paris, 1854), pointed out that, though this engraving\r\nfaithfully expressed the cerebral foldings as seen on the surface, it\r\ngave a very false idea of the relative position of the several parts\r\nof the brain, which, as very commonly happens in such preparations, had\r\nshrunk and greatly sunk down by their own weight.*\r\n\r\n     (* Gratiolet's words are: \"Les plis cerebraux du chimpanze y\r\n     sont fort bien etudies, malheureusement le cerveau qui leur\r\n     a servi de modele etait profondement affaisse, aussi la\r\n     forme generale du cerveau est-elle rendue, dans leurs\r\n     planches, d'une maniere tout-a-fait fausse.\" Ibid. page 18.)\r\n\r\nAnticipating the serious mistakes which would arise from this inaccurate\r\nrepresentation of the brain of the ape, published under the auspices of\r\nmen so deserving of trust as the two above-named Dutch anatomists, M.\r\nGratiolet thought it expedient, by way of warning to his readers, to\r\nrepeat their incorrect figures (Figures 54 and 55), and to place by the\r\nside of them two correct views (Figures 56 and 57) of the brain of the\r\nsame ape. By reference to these illustrations, as well as to Figure 58,\r\nthe reader will see not only the contrast of the relative position of\r\nthe cerebrum and cerebellum, as delineated in the natural as well as\r\nin the distorted state, but also the remarkable general correspondence\r\nbetween the chimpanzee brain and that of the human subject in everything\r\nsave in size. The human brain (Figure 58) here given, by Gratiolet,\r\nis that of an African bushwoman, called the Hottentot Venus, who was\r\nexhibited formerly in London, and who died in Paris.\r\n\r\nRespecting this striking analogy of cerebral structure in Man and the\r\napes, Gratiolet says, in the work above cited: \"The convoluted brain\r\nof Man and the smooth brain of the marmoset resemble each other by the\r\nquadruple character of a rudimentary olfactory lobe, a posterior lobe\r\nCOMPLETELY COVERING THE CEREBELLUM, a well-defined fissure of Sylvius\r\n(ff, Figure 56), and lastly a posterior horn in the lateral ventricle.\r\nThese characters are not met with together except in Man and the apes.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Gratiolet, ibid. Avant-propos page 2 1854.)\r\n\r\nIn reference to the other figure of a monkey given by Professor Owen,\r\nnamely, that of the Midas, one of the marmosets, he states, in 1857 as\r\nhe had done in 1837, that the posterior part of the cerebral hemispheres\r\n\"extends, as in most of the quadrumana, over the greater part of the\r\ncerebellum.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Proceedings of the Linnaean Society\" 1857 page 18 note,\r\n     and \"Philosophical Transactions\" 1837 page 93.)\r\n\r\nIn 1859, in his Rede Lecture, delivered to the University of Cambridge,\r\nthe same illustrations of the ape's brain were given, namely, that of\r\nthe Midas and the distorted one of the Dutch anatomists already cited\r\n(Figure 54).*\r\n\r\n     (* See Appendix M.)\r\n\r\nTwo years later, Professor Huxley, in a memoir \"On the Zoological\r\nRelations of Man with the Lower Animals,\" took occasion to refer to\r\nGratiolet's warning, and to cite his criticism on the Dutch plates;* but\r\nthis reminder appears to have been overlooked by Professor Owen, who six\r\nmonths later came out with a new paper on \"The Cerebral Character of\r\nMan and the Ape,\" in which he repeated the incorrect representation\r\nof Schroeder van der Kolk and Vrolik, associating it with Tiedemann's\r\nfigure of a negro's brain, expressly to show the relative and different\r\nextent to which the cerebellum is overlapped by the cerebrum in the two\r\ncases respectively.** In the ape's brain as thus depicted, the portion\r\nof the cerebellum left uncovered is greater than in the lemurs, the\r\nlowest type of Primates, and almost as large as in the rodentia, or some\r\nof the lowest grades of the mammalia.\r\n\r\n     (* Huxley, \"Natural History Review\" January 7, 1861 page\r\n     76.)\r\n\r\n     (** \"Annals and Magazine of Natural History\" volume 7 1861\r\n     page 456 and Plate 20.)\r\n\r\nWhen the Dutch naturalists above mentioned found their figures so often\r\nappealed to as authority, by one the weight of whose opinion on such\r\nmatters they well knew how to appreciate, they resolved to do their\r\nbest towards preventing the public from being misled. Accordingly, they\r\naddressed to the Royal Academy of Amsterdam a memoir \"On the brain of\r\nan Orang-outang\" which had just died in the Zoological Gardens of that\r\ncity.*\r\n\r\n     (* This paper is reprinted in the original French in the\r\n     \"Natural History Review\" volume 2 1862 page 111.)\r\n\r\nThe dissection of this ape, in 1861, fully bore out the general\r\nconclusions at which they had previously arrived in 1849, as to\r\nthe existence both in the human and the simian brain of the three\r\ncharacters, which Professor Owen had represented as exclusively\r\nappertaining to Man, namely, the occipital or posterior lobe, the\r\nhippocampus minor, and the posterior cornu. These last two features\r\nconsist of certain cavities and furrows in the posterior lobes, which\r\nare caused by the foldings of the brain, and are only visible when it is\r\ndissected. MM. Schroeder van der Kolk and Vrolik took this opportunity\r\nof candidly confessing that M. Gratiolet's comments on the defects of\r\ntheir two figures (Figures 54 and 55) were perfectly just, and they\r\nexpressed regret that Professor Owen should have overstated the\r\ndifferences existing between the brain of Man and the Quadrumana, \"led\r\nastray, as they supposed, by his zeal to combat the Darwinian theory\r\nrespecting the transformation of species,\" a doctrine against which\r\nthey themselves protested strongly, saying that it belongs to a class\r\nof speculations which are sure to be revived from time to time, and are\r\nalways \"peculiarly seductive to young and sanguine minds.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Ibid. page 114.)\r\n\r\nAs the two memoirs before alluded to by us, the one by Mr. Darwin on\r\n\"Natural Selection,\" and the other by Mr. Wallace \"On the Tendency of\r\nVarieties to depart indefinitely from the original Type,\" did not appear\r\ntill 1858, a year after Professor Owen's classification of the mammalia,\r\nand as Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" was not published till another year\r\nhad elapsed, we cannot accept the explanation above offered to us of the\r\ncauses which led the founder of the sub-class Archencephala to seek for\r\nnew points of distinction between the human and simian brains; but the\r\nDutch anatomists may have fallen into this anachronism by having just\r\nread, in the paper by Professor Owen in the \"Annals,\" some prefatory\r\nallusions to \"the Vestiges of Creation,\" \"Natural Selection, and the\r\nquestion whether man be or be not a descendant of the ape.\"\r\n\r\nThe number of original and important memoirs to which this discussion on\r\nthe cerebral relations of Man to the Primates has already given rise in\r\nless than five years, must render the controversy for ever memorable in\r\nthe history of Comparative Anatomy.*\r\n\r\n     (* Rolleston, \"Natural History Review\" April 1861.

These are:--\r\n\r\n     Troglodytes (Chimpanzee).\r\n     Pithecus (Orang).\r\n     Hylobates (Gibbon).\r\n\r\n     Semnopithecus.\r\n     Cercopithecus.\r\n     Macacus.\r\n     Cynocephalus (Baboon).\r\n     Ateles (Spider Monkey).\r\n\r\n     Cebus (Capuchin Monkey).\r\n     Pithecia (Saki).\r\n     Nyctipithecus (Douricouli).\r\n\r\n     Hapale (Marmoset).\r\n\r\n     Otolicnus.\r\n     Stenops.\r\n     Lemur.\r\n\r\nIn July 1861 Mr. Marshall, in a paper on the brain of a young\r\nChimpanzee, which he had dissected immediately after its death, gave a\r\nseries of photographic drawings, showing that when the parts are all\r\nin a fresh state, the posterior lobe of the cerebrum, instead of simply\r\ncovering the cerebellum, is prolonged backwards beyond it even to a\r\ngreater extent than in Gratiolet's figure, 56, and, what is more in\r\npoint, in a greater degree relatively speaking (at least in the young\r\nstate of the animal) than in Man. In fact, \"the projection is to the\r\nextent of about one-ninth of the total length of the cerebrum, whereas\r\nthe average excess of overlapping is only one-eleventh in the human\r\nbrain.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Marshall, \"Natural History Review\" July 1861. See also on\r\n     this subject Professor Rolleston on the slight degree of\r\n     backward extension of the cerebrum in some races of Man.\r\n     \"Medical Times\" October 1862, page 419.)\r\n\r\nThe same author gives an instructive account of the manner in which\r\ndisplacement and distortion take place when such brains are preserved in\r\nspirits as in the ordinary preparations of the anatomist.\r\n\r\nMr. Flower, in a recent paper on the posterior lobe of the cerebrum in\r\nthe Quadrumana,* remarks, that although Tiedemann had declared himself\r\nunable in 1821 to detect the hippocampus minor or the posterior cornu\r\nof the lateral ventricle in the brain of a Macacus dissected by him,\r\nCuvier, nevertheless, mentions the latter as characteristic of Man and\r\nthe apes, and M. Serres in his well-known work on the brain in 1826,\r\nhas shown in at least four species of apes the presence of both the\r\nhippocampus minor and the posterior cornu.\r\n\r\n     (* \"Philosophical Transactions\" 1862 page 185.)\r\n\r\nTiedemann had expressly stated that \"the third or hinder lobe in the ape\r\ncovered the cerebellum as in Man,\"* and as to his negative evidence in\r\nrespect to the internal structure of that lobe, it can have no weight\r\nwhatever against the positive proofs obtained to the contrary by a host\r\nof able observers. Even before Tiedemann's work was published, Kuhl had\r\ndissected, in 1820, the brain of the spider-monkey (Ateles beelzebuth),\r\nand had given a figure of a long posterior cornu to the lateral\r\nventricle, which he had described as such.**\r\n\r\n     (* Tiedemann, \"Icones cerebri Simiarum\" etc. page 48.)\r\n\r\n     (** \"Beitrage zur Zoologie\" etc. Frankfurt am Main 1820.)\r\n\r\nThe general results arrived at by the English anatomists already cited,\r\nand by Professor Rolleston in various papers on the same subject, have\r\nthus been briefly stated by Professor Huxley:--\r\n\r\n\"Every lemur which has yet been examined has its cerebellum partially\r\nvisible from above, and its posterior lobe, with the contained posterior\r\ncornu and hippocampus minor, more or less rudimentary. Every marmoset,\r\nAmerican monkey, Old World monkey, baboon, or man-like ape, on the\r\ncontrary, has its cerebellum entirely hidden, and possesses a large\r\nposterior cornu, with a well-developed hippocampus minor.\r\n\r\n\"In many of these creatures, such as the Saimiri (Chrysothrix), the\r\ncerebral lobes overlap and extend much farther behind the cerebellum in\r\nproportion than they do in Man.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Huxley, \"Evidence as to Man's place in Nature\" page 97.)\r\n\r\nIt is by no means pretended that these conclusions of British observers\r\nas to the affinity in cerebral structure of Man and the Primates are\r\nnew, but on the contrary that they confirm the inductions previously\r\nmade by the principal continental teachers of the last and present\r\ngenerations, such as Tiedemann, Cuvier, Serres, Leuret, Wagner,\r\nSchroeder van der Kolk, Vrolik, Gratiolet, and others.\r\n\r\nAt a late meeting of the British Association (1862), Professor Owen read\r\na paper \"On the brain and limb characters of the Gorilla as contrasted\r\nwith those of Man\"* in which, he observes, that in the gorilla the\r\ncerebrum \"extends over the cerebellum, not beyond it.\"\r\n\r\n     (* Medical Times and Gazette\" October 1862 page 373.)\r\n\r\nThis statement, although slightly at variance with one published the\r\nyear before (1861) by Professor Huxley, who maintains that it does\r\nproject beyond, is interesting as correcting the description of the same\r\nbrain given by Professor Owen in that year, in a lecture to the Royal\r\nInstitution, in which a considerable part of the cerebellum of the\r\ngorilla was represented as uncovered.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Athenaeum\" Report of Royal Institution Lecture, March\r\n     23, 1861, and reference to it by Professor Owen as to\r\n     Gorilla, ibid. March 30 page 434.)\r\n\r\nIn the same memoir, it is remarked that in the Maimon Baboon the\r\ncerebrum not only covers but \"extends backwards even beyond the\r\ncerebellum.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* For Report of Professor Owen's Cambridge British\r\n     Association paper see \"Medical Times\" October 11, 1862 page\r\n     373.)\r\n\r\nThis baboon, therefore, possesses a posterior lobe, according to every\r\ndescription yet given of such a lobe, including a new definition of\r\nthe same lately proposed by Professor Owen. For the posterior lobe was\r\nformerly considered to be that part of the cerebrum which covers the\r\ncerebellum, whereas Professor Owen defines it as that part which covers\r\nthe posterior third of the cerebellum, and extends beyond it.\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, consider the attempt to distinguish the brain of\r\nMan from that of the ape on the ground of newly-discovered cerebral\r\ncharacters, presenting differences in kind, as virtually abandoned by\r\nits originator, and if the sub-class Archencephala is to be retained, it\r\nmust depend on differences in degree, as, for example, the vast increase\r\nof the brain in Man, as compared with that of the highest ape, \"in\r\nabsolute size, and the still greater superiority in relative size to the\r\nbulk and weight of the body.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Owen, ibid. page 373.)\r\n\r\nIf we ask why this character, though well known to Cuvier and other\r\ngreat anatomists before our time, was not considered by them to entitle\r\nMan, physically considered, to claim a more distinct place in the group\r\ncalled Primates than that of a separate order, or, according to others,\r\na separate genus or family only, we shall find the answer thus concisely\r\nstated by Professor Huxley in his new work, before cited:--\r\n\r\n\"So far as I am aware, no human cranium belonging to an adult man has\r\nyet been observed with a less cubical capacity than 62 cubic inches, the\r\nsmallest cranium observed in any race of men, by Morton, measuring 63\r\ncubic inches; while on the other hand, the most capacious gorilla skull\r\nyet measured has a content of not more than 34 1/2 cubic inches. Let us\r\nassume for simplicity's sake, that the lowest man's skull has twice\r\nthe capacity of the highest gorilla's. No doubt this is a very striking\r\ndifference, but it loses much of its apparent systematic value,\r\nwhen viewed by the light of certain other equally indubitable facts\r\nrespecting cranial capacities.\r\n\r\n\"The first of these is, that the difference in the volume of the cranial\r\ncavity of different races of mankind is far greater, absolutely, than\r\nthat between the lowest man and the highest ape, while, relatively,\r\nit is about the same; for the largest human skull measured by Morton\r\ncontained 114 cubic inches, that is to say, had very nearly double the\r\ncapacity of the smallest, while its absolute preponderance of over 50\r\ncubic inches is far greater than that by which the lowest adult male\r\nhuman cranium surpasses the largest of the gorillas (62 minus 34 1/2 =\r\n27 1/2). Secondly, the adult crania of gorillas which have as yet been\r\nmeasured, differ among themselves by nearly one-third, the maximum\r\ncapacity being 34.5 cubic inches, the minimum 24 cubic inches; and,\r\nthirdly, after making all due allowance for difference of size, the\r\ncranial capacities of some of the lower apes fall nearly as much\r\nrelatively below those of the higher apes, as the latter fall below\r\nMan.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Huxley, \"Evidence as to Man's place in Nature\" London\r\n     1863 page 78. )\r\n\r\nAre we then to conclude that differences in mental power have no\r\nintimate connection with the comparative volume of the brain? We cannot\r\ndraw such an inference, because the highest and most civilised races of\r\nMan exceed in the average of their cranial capacity the lowest races,\r\nthe European brain, for example, being larger than that of the negro,\r\nand somewhat more convoluted and less symmetrical, and those apes, on\r\nthe other hand, which approach nearest to Man in the form and volume\r\nof their brain being more intelligent than the Lemurs, or still lower\r\ndivisions of the mammalia, such as the Rodents and Marsupials, which\r\nhave smaller brains. But the extraordinary intelligence of the elephant\r\nand dog, so far exceeding that of the larger part of the Quadrumana,\r\nalthough their brains are of a type much more remote from the human, may\r\nserve to convince us how far we are as yet from understanding the\r\nreal nature of the dependence of intellectual superiority on cerebral\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nProfessor Rolleston, in reference to this subject, remarks, that \"even\r\nif it were to be proved that the differences between Man's brain and\r\nthat of the ape are differences entirely of quantity, there is\r\nno reason, in the nature of things, why so many and such weighty\r\ndifferences in degree should not amount to a difference in kind.\r\n\r\n\"Differences of degree and differences of kind are, it is true, mutually\r\nexclusive terms in the language of the schools; but whether they are so\r\nalso in the laboratory of Nature, we may very well doubt.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Report of a Lecture delivered at the Royal Institution by\r\n     Professor George Rolleston \"On the Brain of Man and Animals\"\r\n     \"Medical Gazette\" March 15, 1862 page 262.)\r\n\r\nThe same physiologist suggests, that as there is considerable plasticity\r\nin the human frame, not only in youth and during growth, but even in the\r\nadult, we ought not always to take for granted, as some advocates of\r\nthe development theory seem to do, that each advance in psychical power\r\ndepends on an improvement in bodily structure, for why may not the soul,\r\nor the higher intellectual and moral faculties, play the first instead\r\nof the second part in a progressive scheme?\r\n\r\n\r\nINTELLIGENCE OF THE LOWER ANIMALS COMPARED TO THAT OF MAN.\r\n\r\nEver since the days of Leibnitz, metaphysicians who have attempted to\r\ndraw a line of demarcation between the intelligence of the lower animals\r\nand that of Man, or between instinct and reason, have experienced\r\ndifficulties analogous to those which the modern anatomist encounters\r\nwhen he tries to distinguish the brain of an ape from that of Man by\r\nsome characters more marked than those of mere size and weight, which\r\nvary so much in individuals of the same species, whether simian or\r\nhuman.\r\n\r\nProfessor Agassiz, after declaring that as yet we scarcely possess the\r\nmost elementary information requisite for a scientific comparison of the\r\ninstincts and faculties of animals with those of Man, confesses that he\r\ncannot say in what the mental faculties of a child differ from those of\r\na young chimpanzee. He also observes, that \"the range of the passions of\r\nanimals is as extensive as that of the human mind, and I am at a loss to\r\nperceive a difference of kind between them, however much they may differ\r\nin degree and in the manner in which they are expressed. The gradations\r\nof the moral faculties among the higher animals and Man are, moreover,\r\nso imperceptible, that to deny to the first a certain sense of\r\nresponsibility and consciousness would certainly be an exaggeration of\r\nthe difference between animals and Man. There exists, besides, as much\r\nindividuality within their respective capabilities among animals as\r\namong Man, as every sportsman, or every keeper of menageries, or every\r\nfarmer and shepherd can testify, who has had a large experience with\r\nwild, or tamed, or domesticated animals. This argues strongly in favour\r\nof the existence in every animal of an immaterial principle, similar\r\nto that which, by its excellence and superior endowments, places Man so\r\nmuch above animals. Yet the principle exists unquestionably, and whether\r\nit be called soul, reason, or instinct, it presents, in the whole range\r\nof organised beings, a series of phenomena closely linked together, and\r\nupon it are based not only the higher manifestations of the mind, but\r\nthe very permanence of the specific differences which characterise every\r\norgan. Most of the arguments of philosophy in favour of the immortality\r\nof Man apply equally to the permanency of this principle in other living\r\nbeings.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Contributions to the \"Natural History of the United\r\n     States of North America\" volume 1 part 1 pages 60 and 64.)\r\n\r\nProfessor Huxley, when commenting on a passage in Professor Owen's\r\nmemoir, above cited, argues that there is a unity in psychical as in\r\nphysical plan among animated beings, and adds, that although he cannot\r\ngo so far as to say that \"the determination of the difference between\r\nHomo and Pithecus is the anatomist's difficulty,\" yet no impartial judge\r\ncan doubt that the roots, as it were, of those great faculties which\r\nconfer on Man his immeasurable superiority above all other animate\r\nthings are traceable far down into the animate world. The dog, the cat,\r\nand the parrot, return love for our love and hatred for our hatred. They\r\nare capable of shame and of sorrow, and though they may have no logic\r\nnor conscious ratiocination, no one who has watched their ways can\r\ndoubt that they possess that power of rational cerebration which evolves\r\nreasonable acts from the premises furnished by the senses--a process\r\nwhich takes fully as large a share as conscious reason in human\r\nactivity.*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Natural History Review\" Number 1 January 1861 page 68.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUNDS FOR REFERRING MAN TO A DISTINCT KINGDOM OF NATURE.\r\n\r\nFew if any of the authors above cited, while they admit so fully the\r\nanalogy which exists between the faculties of Man and the inferior\r\nanimals, are disposed to underrate the enormous gap which separates Man\r\nfrom the brutes, and if they scarcely allow him to be referable to\r\na distinct order, and much less to a separate sub-class, on purely\r\nphysical grounds, it does not follow that they would object to the\r\nreasoning of M. Quatrefages, who says, in his work on the \"Unity of\r\nthe Human Species,\" that Man must form a kingdom by himself if once we\r\npermit his moral and intellectual endowments to have their due weight in\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nAs to his organisation, he observes, \"We find in the mammalia nearly\r\nabsolute identity of anatomical structure, bone for bone, muscle for\r\nmuscle, nerve for nerve--similar organs performing like functions. It is\r\nnot by a vertical position on his feet, the os sublime of Ovid, which he\r\nshares with the penguin, nor by his mental faculties, which, though more\r\ndeveloped, are fundamentally the same as those of animals, nor by his\r\npowers of perception, will, memory, and a certain amount of reason, nor\r\nby articulate speech, which he shares with birds and some mammalia,\r\nand by which they express ideas comprehended not only by individuals of\r\ntheir own species but often by Man, nor is it by the faculties of the\r\nheart, such as love and hatred, which are also shared by quadrupeds and\r\nbirds, but it is by something completely foreign to the mere animal, and\r\nbelonging exclusively to Man, that we must establish a separate kingdom\r\nfor him (page 21). These distinguishing characters,\" he goes on to say,\r\n\"are the abstract notion of good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and\r\nvice, or the moral faculty, and a belief in a world beyond ours, and in\r\ncertain mysterious beings, or a Being of a higher nature than ours,\r\nwhom we ought to fear or revere; in other words, the religious\r\nfaculty.\"--page 23.\r\n\r\nBy these two attributes the moral and the religious, not common to man\r\nand the brutes, M. Quatrefages proposes to distinguish the human from\r\nthe animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut he omits to notice one essential character, which Dr. Sumner, the\r\nlate Archbishop of Canterbury, brought out in strong relief fifty years\r\nago in his \"Records of Creation.\" \"There are writers,\" he observes, \"who\r\nhave taken an extraordinary pleasure in levelling the broad distinction\r\nwhich separates Man from the Brute Creation. Misled to a false\r\nconclusion by the infinite variety of Nature's productions, they have\r\ndescribed a chain of existence connecting the vegetable with the animal\r\nworld, and the different orders of animals one with another, so as to\r\nrise by an almost imperceptible gradation from the tribe of Simiae\r\nto the lowest of the human race, and from these upwards to the most\r\nrefined. But if a comparison were to be drawn, it should be taken, not\r\nfrom the upright form, which is by no means confined to mankind, nor\r\neven from the vague term reason, which cannot always be accurately\r\nseparated from instinct, but from that power of progressive and\r\nimprovable reason, which is Man's peculiar and exclusive endowment.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been sometimes alleged, and may be founded on fact, that there\r\nis less difference between the highest brute animal and the lowest\r\nsavage than between the savage and the most improved Man. But, in order\r\nto warrant the pretended analogy, it ought to be also true that this\r\nlowest savage is no more capable of improvement than the Chimpanzee or\r\nOrang-outang.\"\r\n\r\n\"Animals,\" he adds, \"are born what they are intended to remain. Nature\r\nhas bestowed upon them a certain rank, and limited the extent of their\r\ncapacity by an impassable decree. Man she has empowered and obliged\r\nto become the artificer of his own rank in the scale of beings by the\r\npeculiar gift of improvable reason.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* \"Records of Creation\" volume 2 chapter 2 2nd edition\r\n     1816.)\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Professor Agassiz, in his \"Essay on Classification,\"\r\nabove cited, speaks of the existence in every animal of \"an immaterial\r\nprinciple similar to that which, by its excellence and superior\r\nendowments, places man so much above animals;\" and he remarks, \"that\r\nmost of the arguments of philosophy in favour of the immortality of\r\nMan, apply equally to the permanency of this principle in other living\r\nbeings.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the author has no intention by this remark to impugn the truth\r\nof the great doctrine alluded to, it may be well to observe, that if\r\nsome of the arguments in favour of a future state are applicable in\r\ncommon to Man and the lower animals, they are by no means those which\r\nare the weightiest and most relied on. It is no doubt true that, in\r\nboth, the identity of the individual outlasts many changes of form and\r\nstructure which take place during the passage from the infant to the\r\nadult state, and from that to old age, and the loss again and again\r\nof every particle of matter which had entered previously into the\r\ncomposition of the body during its growth, and the substitution of new\r\nelements in their place, while the individual remains always the same,\r\ncarries the analogy a step farther. But beyond this we cannot push the\r\ncomparison. We cannot imagine this world to be a place of trial and\r\nmoral discipline for any of the inferior animals, nor can any of them\r\nderive comfort and happiness from faith in a hereafter. To Man alone is\r\ngiven this belief, so consonant to his reason, and so congenial to the\r\nreligious sentiments implanted by nature in his soul, a doctrine which\r\ntends to raise him morally and intellectually in the scale of being, and\r\nthe fruits of which are, therefore, most opposite in character to those\r\nwhich grow out of error and delusion.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of the theory of transmutation sometimes argue that, if\r\nthere had been a passage by variation from the lower Primates to Man,\r\nthe geologist ought ere this to have detected some fossil remains of the\r\nintermediate links of the chain. But what we have said respecting the\r\nabsence of gradational forms between the Recent and Pliocene mammalia\r\nmay serve to show the weakness in the present state of science of any\r\nargument based on such negative evidence, especially in the case of Man,\r\nsince we have not yet reached those pages of the great book of nature,\r\nin which alone we have any right to expect to find records of the\r\nmissing links alluded to. The countries of the anthropomorphous apes are\r\nthe tropical regions of Africa, and the islands of Borneo and Sumatra,\r\nlands which may be said to be quite unknown in reference to their\r\nPliocene and Pleistocene mammalia. Man is an old-world type, and it is\r\nnot in Brazil, the only equatorial region where ossiferous caverns have\r\nyet been explored, that the discovery, in a fossil state, of extinct\r\nforms allied to the human, could be looked for. Lund, a Danish\r\nnaturalist, found in Brazil, not only extinct sloths and armadilloes,\r\nbut extinct genera of fossil monkeys, but all of the American type, and,\r\ntherefore, widely departing in their dentition and some other characters\r\nfrom the Primates of the old world.\r\n\r\nAt some future day, when many hundred species of extinct quadrumana may\r\nhave been brought to light, the naturalist may speculate with advantage\r\non this subject; at present we must be content to wait patiently, and\r\nnot to allow our judgment respecting transmutation to be influenced by\r\nthe want of evidence, which it would be contrary to analogy to look for\r\nin Pleistocene deposits in any districts, which as yet we have carefully\r\nexamined. For, as we meet with extinct kangaroos and wombats in\r\nAustralia, extinct llamas and sloths in South America, so in equatorial\r\nAfrica, and in certain islands of the East Indian Archipelago, may\r\nwe hope to meet hereafter with lost types of the anthropoid Primates,\r\nallied to the gorilla, chimpanzee, and orang-outang. [44]\r\n\r\nEurope, during the Pliocene period, seems not to have enjoyed a climate\r\nfitting it to be the habitation of the quadrumanous mammalia; but we no\r\nsooner carry back our researches into Miocene times, where plants and\r\ninsects, like those of Oeningen, and shells, like those of the Faluns of\r\nthe Loire, would imply a warmer temperature both of sea and land, than\r\nwe begin to discover fossil apes and monkeys north of the Alps and\r\nPyrenees. Among the few species already detected, two at least belong to\r\nthe anthropomorphous class. One of these, the Dryopithecus of Lartet, a\r\ngibbon or long-armed ape, about equal to man in stature, was obtained\r\nin the year 1856 in the Upper Miocene strata at Sansan, near the foot\r\nof the Pyrenees in the South of France, and one bone of the same ape is\r\nreported to have been since procured from a deposit of corresponding age\r\nat Eppelsheim, near Darmstadt, in a latitude answering to that of the\r\nsouthern counties of England.*\r\n\r\n     (* Owen, \"Geologist\" November 1862.)\r\n\r\nBut according to the doctrine of progression it is not in these\r\nMiocene strata, but in those of Pliocene and Pleistocene date, in\r\nmore equatorial regions, that there will be the greatest chance of\r\ndiscovering hereafter some species more highly organised than the\r\ngorilla and chimpanzee.\r\n\r\nThe only reputed fossil monkey of Eocene date, namely, that found in\r\n1840 at Kyson, in Suffolk, and so determined by Professor Owen, has\r\nrecently been pronounced by the same anatomist, after re-examination,\r\nand when he had ampler materials at his command, to be a pachyderm.\r\n\r\nM. Rutimeyer,* however, an able osteologist, referred to in the earlier\r\nchapters of this work, has just announced the discovery in Eocene\r\nstrata, in the Swiss Jura, of a monkey allied to the lemurs, but as\r\nhe has only obtained as yet a small fragment of a jaw with three molar\r\nteeth, we must wait for fuller information before we confidently rely\r\non the claims of his Coenopithecus lemuroides to take rank as one of the\r\nPrimates.\r\n\r\n     (* Rutimeyer, \"Eocene Saugethiere\" Zurich 1862.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHALLAM ON MAN'S PLACE IN THE CREATION.\r\n\r\nHallam, in his \"Literature of Europe,\" after indulging in some profound\r\nreflections on \"the thoughts of Pascal,\" and the theological dogmas of\r\nhis school respecting the fallen nature of Man, thus speaks of Man's\r\nplace in the creation--\"It might be wandering from the proper subject\r\nof these volumes if we were to pause, even shortly, to inquire whether,\r\nwhile the creation of a world so full of evil must ever remain the most\r\ninscrutable of mysteries, we might not be led some way in tracing the\r\nconnection of moral and physical evil in mankind, with his place in that\r\ncreation, and especially, whether the law of continuity, which it has\r\nnot pleased his Maker to break with respect to his bodily structure, and\r\nwhich binds that, in the unity of one great type, to the lower forms of\r\nanimal life by the common conditions of nourishment, reproduction, and\r\nself-defence, has not rendered necessary both the physical appetites\r\nand the propensities which terminate in self; whether again the superior\r\nendowments of his intellectual nature, his susceptibility of\r\nmoral emotion, and of those disinterested affections which, if\r\nnot exclusively, he far more intensely possesses than an inferior\r\nbeing--above all, the gifts of conscience and a capacity to know God,\r\nmight not be expected, even beforehand, by their conflict with the\r\nanimal passions, to produce some partial inconsistencies, some anomalies\r\nat least, which he could not himself explain in so compound a being.\r\nEvery link in the long chain of creation does not pass by easy\r\ntransition into the next. There are necessary chasms, and, as it were,\r\nleaps from one creature to another, which, though no exceptions to the\r\nlaw of continuity, are accommodations of it to a new series of being.\r\nIf Man was made in the image of God, he was also made in the image of an\r\nape. The framework of the body of him who has weighed the stars and made\r\nthe lightning his slave, approaches to that of a speechless brute, who\r\nwanders in the forests of Sumatra. Thus standing on the frontier land\r\nbetween animal and angelic natures, what wonder that he should partake\r\nof both!\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Hallam, \"Introduction to the Literature of Europe\" etc.\r\n     volume 4 page 162.)\r\n\r\nThe law of continuity here spoken of, as not being violated by\r\noccasional exceptions, or by leaps from one creature to another, is not\r\nthe law of variation and natural selection above explained (Chapter 21),\r\nbut that unity of plan supposed to exist in the Divine Mind, whether\r\nrealised or not materially and in the visible creation, of which the\r\n\"links do not pass by an easy transition\" the one into the other, at\r\nleast as beheld by us.\r\n\r\nDr. Asa Gray, an eminent American botanist, to whom we are indebted\r\nfor a philosophical essay of great merit on the \"Origin of Species by\r\nVariation and Natural Selection,\" has well observed, when speaking of\r\nthe axiom of Leibnitz, \"Natura non agit saltatim,\" that nature secures\r\nher ends and makes her distinctions, on the whole, manifest and real,\r\nbut without any important breaks or long leaps. \"We need not wonder that\r\ngradations between species and varieties should occur, or that genera\r\nand other groups should not be absolutely limited, though they are\r\nrepresented to be so in our systems. The classifications of the\r\nnaturalist define abruptly where nature more or less blends. Our systems\r\nare nothing if not definite.\"\r\n\r\nThe same writer reminds us that \"plants and animals are so different,\r\nthat the difficulty of the ordinary observer would be to find points of\r\ncomparison, whereas, with the naturalist, it is all the other way.\r\nAll the broad differences vanish one by one as we approach the\r\nlower confines of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and no absolute\r\ndistinction whatever is now known between them.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Gray, \"Natural Selection not inconsistent with Natural\r\n     Theology\" Trubner & Co. London 1861 page 55.)\r\n\r\nThe author of an elaborate review of Darwin's \"Origin of Species,\"\r\nhimself an accomplished geologist, declares that if we embrace the\r\ndoctrine of the continuous variation of all organic forms from the\r\nlowest to the highest, including Man as the last link in the chain of\r\nbeing, there must have been a transition from the instinct of the brute\r\nto the noble mind of Man; and in that case, \"where,\" he asks, \"are the\r\nmissing links, and at what point of his progressive improvement did Man\r\nacquire the spiritual part of his being, and become endowed with the\r\nawful attribute of immortality?\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Physical Theories of the Phenomena of Life \"Fraser's\r\n     Magazine\" July 1860 page 88.)\r\n\r\nBefore we raise objections of this kind to a scientific hypothesis,\r\nit would be well to pause and inquire whether there are no analogous\r\nenigmas in the constitution of the world around us, some of which\r\npresent even greater difficulties than that here stated. When we\r\ncontemplate, for example, the many hundred millions of human beings who\r\nnow people the earth, we behold thousands who are doomed to helpless\r\nimbecility, and we may trace an insensible gradation between them\r\nand the half-witted, and from these again to individuals of perfect\r\nunderstanding, so that tens of thousands must have existed in the course\r\nof ages, who in their moral and intellectual condition, have exhibited\r\na passage from the irrational to the rational, or from the irresponsible\r\nto the responsible. Moreover we may infer from the returns of the\r\nRegistrar General of births and deaths in Great Britain, and from\r\nQuetelet's statistics of Belgium, that one-fourth of the human race die\r\nin early infancy, nearly one-tenth before they are a month old; so that\r\nwe may safely affirm that millions perish on the earth in every century,\r\nin the first few hours of their existence. To assign to such individuals\r\ntheir appropriate psychological place in the creation is one of the\r\nunprofitable themes on which theologians and metaphysicians have\r\nexpended much ingenious speculation.\r\n\r\nThe philosopher, without ignoring these difficulties, does not allow\r\nthem to disturb his conviction that \"whatever is, is right,\" nor do they\r\ncheck his hopes and aspirations in regard to the high destiny of his\r\nspecies; but he also feels that it is not for one who is so often\r\nconfounded by the painful realities of the present, to test the\r\nprobability of theories respecting the past, by their agreement or want\r\nof agreement with some ideal of a perfect universe which those who are\r\nopposed to opinions may have pictured to themselves.\r\n\r\nWe may also demur to the assumption that the hypothesis of variation\r\nand natural selection obliges us to assume that there was an absolutely\r\ninsensible passage from the highest intelligence of the inferior\r\nanimals to the improvable reason of Man. The birth of an individual\r\nof transcendent genius, of parents who have never displayed any\r\nintellectual capacity above the average standard of their age or race,\r\nis a phenomenon not to be lost sight of, when we are conjecturing\r\nwhether the successive steps in advance by which a progressive scheme\r\nhas been developed may not admit of occasional strides, constituting\r\nbreaks in an otherwise continuous series of psychical changes.\r\n\r\nThe inventors of useful arts, the poets and prophets of the early stages\r\nof a nation's growth, the promulgators of new systems of religion,\r\nethics, and philosophy, or of new codes of laws, have often been looked\r\nupon as messengers from Heaven, and after their death have had divine\r\nhonours paid to them, while fabulous tales have been told of the\r\nprodigies which accompanied their birth. Nor can we wonder that such\r\nnotions have prevailed when we consider what important revolutions\r\nin the moral and intellectual world such leading spirits have brought\r\nabout; and when we reflect that mental as well as physical attributes\r\nare transmissible by inheritance, so that we may possibly discern in\r\nsuch leaps the origin of the superiority of certain races of mankind.\r\nIn our own time the occasional appearance of such extraordinary\r\nmental powers may be attributed to atavism; but there must have been\r\na beginning to the series of such rare and anomalous events. If, in\r\nconformity with the theory of progression, we believe mankind to have\r\nrisen slowly from a rude and humble starting point, such leaps may have\r\nsuccessively introduced not only higher and higher forms and grades of\r\nintellect, but at a much remoter period may have cleared at one bound\r\nthe space which separated the highest stage of the unprogressive\r\nintelligence of the inferior animals from the first and lowest form of\r\nimprovable reason manifested by Man.\r\n\r\nTo say that such leaps constitute no interruption to the ordinary course\r\nof nature is more than we are warranted in affirming. In the case of the\r\noccasional birth of an individual of superior genius there is certainly\r\nno break in the regular genealogical succession; and when all the mists\r\nof mythological fiction are dispelled by historical criticism, when it\r\nis acknowledged that the earth did not tremble at the nativity of the\r\ngifted infant and that the face of heaven was not full of fiery shapes,\r\nstill a mighty mystery remains unexplained, and it is the ORDER of the\r\nphenomena, and not their CAUSE, which we are able to refer to the usual\r\ncourse of nature.\r\n\r\nDr. Asa Gray, in the excellent essay already cited, has pointed out that\r\nthere is no tendency in the doctrine of Variation and Natural Selection\r\nto weaken the foundations of Natural Theology, for, consistently with\r\nthe derivative hypothesis of species, we may hold any of the popular\r\nviews respecting the manner in which the changes of the natural world\r\nare brought about. We may imagine \"that events and operations in general\r\ngo on in virtue simply of forces communicated at the first, and without\r\nany subsequent interference, or we may hold that now and then, and only\r\nnow and then, there is a direct interposition of the Deity; or, lastly,\r\nwe may suppose that all the changes are carried on by the immediate\r\norderly and constant, however infinitely diversified, action of the\r\nintelligent, efficient Cause.\" They who maintain that the origin of\r\nan individual, as well as the origin of a species or a genus, can be\r\nexplained only by the direct action of the creative cause, may retain\r\ntheir favourite theory compatibly with the doctrine of transmutation.\r\n\r\nProfessor Agassiz, having observed that, \"while human thought is\r\nconsecutive, divine thought is simultaneous,\" Dr. Asa Gray has replied\r\nthat, \"if divine thought is simultaneous, we have no right to affirm the\r\nsame of divine action.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole course of nature may be the material embodiment of a\r\npreconcerted arrangement; and if the succession of events be explained\r\nby transmutation, the perpetual adaptation of the organic world to new\r\nconditions leaves the argument in favour of design, and therefore of a\r\ndesigner, as valid as ever; \"for to do any work by an instrument must\r\nrequire, and therefore presuppose, the exertion rather of more than of\r\nless power, than to do it directly.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Asa Gray, \"Natural Selection not inconsistent with\r\n     Natural Theology\" Trubner & Co. London 1861 page 55.)\r\n\r\nAs to the charge of materialism brought against all forms of the\r\ndevelopment theory, Dr. Gray has done well to remind us that \"of the\r\ntwo great minds of the seventeenth century, Newton and Leibnitz, both\r\nprofoundly religious as well as philosophical, one produced the\r\ntheory of gravitation, the other objected to that theory, that it was\r\nsubversive of natural religion.\"*\r\n\r\n     (* Ibid. page 31.)\r\n\r\nIt may be said that, so far from having a materialistic tendency, the\r\nsupposed introduction into the earth at successive geological periods\r\nof life--sensation--instinct--the intelligence of the higher mammalia\r\nbordering on reason--and lastly the improvable reason of Man himself,\r\npresents us with a picture of the ever-increasing dominion of mind over\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The classification of the strata above the Chalk, as at\r\npresent employed by the majority of British geologists, is merely a\r\nslight modification of that proposed by Lyell in 1833. The subdivisions\r\ngenerally recognised are as follows (Lake and Rastall, \"Textbook of\r\nGeology,\" London, 1910, page 438):--\r\n\r\n    Neogene:\r\n    Pleistocene\r\n    Pliocene\r\n    Miocene.\r\n\r\n    Palaeogene:\r\n    Oligocene\r\n    Eocene.\r\n\r\nThis differs chiefly from Lyell's classification in the introduction of\r\nthe term Oligocene for the upper part of the original Eocene, which was\r\nsomewhat unwieldy. In the earlier editions of the \"Antiquity of Man\" and\r\nof the \"Principles of Geology,\" the strata here classed as Pleistocene\r\nwere designated as Post-pliocene. The term \"diluvium,\" now obsolete\r\nin Britain but still lingering on the Continent, is equivalent to\r\nPleistocene. This subdivision is still sometimes separated from the\r\nTertiary, as the Quaternary epoch. This, however, is unnecessary and\r\nindeed objectionable, as attributing too great importance to\r\nrelatively insignificant deposits. There is no definite break, either\r\nstratigraphical or palaeontological, at the top of the Pliocene, and\r\nit is most natural to regard the Tertiary epoch as still in progress.\r\nEqually unnecessary is the separation of the post-glacial deposits\r\nas \"Recent,\" a distinction which still prevails in many quarters,\r\napparently with the sole object of adding another name to an already\r\nover-burdened list.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The table of strata here printed is not that given by\r\nLyell in the later editions of the \"Antiquity of Man.\" This would have\r\nrequired so much explanation in the light of modern work that it was\r\nthought better to abolish it altogether and to substitute an entirely\r\nnew table, which is to some extent a compromise between the numerous\r\nclassifications now in vogue. In this form it is only strictly\r\napplicable to the British Isles, though the divisions adopted in other\r\ncountries are generally similar, and in many cases identical.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A similar succession of forest-beds, five in number, has\r\nbeen observed in the peat of the Fenland, near Ely. Each bed consists\r\nfor the most part of a single species of tree, and a definite succession\r\nof oak, yew, Scotch fir, alder, and willow has been made out. The forest\r\nbeds are supposed to indicate temporarily drier conditions, due either\r\nto changes of climate or to slight uplift of the land, the growth of\r\npeat being renewed during periods of damp climate or of depression of\r\nthe land. (See Clement Reid, \"Submerged Forests,\" Cambridge, 1913.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Since the \"Stone Age,\" in the sense in which the term is\r\nhere employed, obviously occupied an enormous lapse of time and embraced\r\nvery different stages of culture, it has been found convenient to\r\nsubdivide it into two primary subdivisions. For these Lord Avebury\r\nproposed in 1865 the terms Palaeolithic and Neolithic. (\" Prehistoric\r\nTimes,\" London, 1865, page 60.) The first comprises the ages during\r\nwhich man fabricated flint implements solely by chipping, whereas\r\nthe implements of Neolithic Age are polished by rubbing. But there\r\nis another and more fundamental distinction. Palaeolithic man was\r\nexclusively a hunter, and consequently nomadic in his habits; Neolithic\r\nman possessed domesticated animals and cultivated crops. A pastoral\r\nand agricultural life implies a settled abode, and these are found, for\r\nexample, in the lake-villages of Switzerland. The \"kitchen-middens\" of\r\nDenmark also indicate long continuance in one place, in this instance\r\nthe seashore.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The famous case of the so-called Temple of Serapis at\r\nPozzuoli, has given rise to a considerable literature. The subject is\r\ndiscussed by Suess at length (\"Des Antlitz der Erde,\" Vienna, 1888,\r\nvolume 2 page 463, or English translation, \"The Face of the Earth,\"\r\nOxford, 1904). This author shows that the whole region is highly\r\nvolcanic, and consequently very liable to disturbance, much relative\r\nmovement of land and sea having occurred within historic times. Hence\r\nthe facts here observed cannot be taken as evidence for any general\r\nupward or downward movement of wide-spread or universal extent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Darwin, \"Voyage of the Beagle,\" chapter 14, and a much\r\nfuller account in the same author's \"Geological Observations on the\r\nVolcanic Islands and Parts of South America Visited during the Voyage of\r\nH.M.S. Beagle,\" chapter 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: For a full discussion of the evidence for and against\r\ncontinental elevation and subsidence in general, and as affecting\r\nthe British Isles and Scandinavia in particular, see Sir A. Geikie's\r\nPresidential Address to the Geological Society for 1904 (\" Proceedings\r\nof the Geological Society\"' volume 60, 1904, pages 80 to 104.). Here it\r\nis shown that the oldest raised beaches of Scotland are pre-glacial, and\r\nthe same also holds for the south of Ireland.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The argument here employed is fallacious, since the mere\r\nexistence of a distinct beach implies a pause in the movement and a long\r\ncontinuance at one level. It is impossible to form any estimate of the\r\nlapse of time necessary for the building up of a beach-terrace. We can\r\nonly, in some cases, obtain a measure of the time that elapsed between\r\nthe formation of two successive beaches, as in this instance.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The \"strand lines,\" or raised beaches of Norway, have given\r\nrise to much discussion, of which a summary will be found in the address\r\ncited in Note 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: A considerable number of skulls and skeletons of the\r\nNeanderthal type have now been found in different parts of Southern\r\nEurope, extending from Belgium to Gibraltar and Croatia, and it is now\r\nknown that this type of skull is associated with flint implements of\r\nMousterian Age. (See Note 12.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The most important discovery of recent years in this\r\nconnection is that made in Sussex by Mr. C. Dawson and Dr. A. Smith\r\nWoodward; this find is described in great detail in the \"Quarterly\r\nJournal of the Geological Society,\" volume 69, 1913, pages 117 to 151.\r\nAt a height of about 80 feet above the present level of the River Ouse,\r\nat Piltdown, near Uckfield, is a gravel, containing many brown flints of\r\npeculiar character, some of which are implements of Chellean or earlier\r\ntype, associated with some remains of Pleistocene animals and a few of\r\nolder date, derived from Pliocene deposits. Embedded in this gravel were\r\nfound fragments of a human skull and lower jaw of very remarkable type,\r\nshowing in some respects distinctly simian characters, while in other\r\nrespects it is less ape-like than the Mousterian skulls of Neanderthal\r\nand other localities. For this form the name of Eoanthropus has been\r\nproposed, thus constituting a new genus of the Hominidae.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: It will be well at this point to give a brief summary of\r\nthe modern classification of the Palaeolithic implement-bearing\r\ndeposits of Europe. From the labours of many geologists and prehistoric\r\narchaeologists, especially in France, a definite succession of types\r\nof implement has been established, and in some cases it has been found\r\npossible to correlate these with actual human remains and with certain\r\nwell-marked events in the physical history of Pleistocene times,\r\nespecially with the advance and retreat of ice-sheets. The present state\r\nof our knowledge is admirably summarised by Professor Sollas (\"Ancient\r\nHunters,\" London, 1911), and from that work the following note is\r\ncondensed.\r\n\r\nThe stages of Palaeolithic culture now recognised are as follows:--\r\n\r\n     Azilian\r\n     Magdalenian\r\n     Solutrean\r\n     Aurignacian\r\n     Mousterian\r\n     Acheulean\r\n     Chellean\r\n     Strepyan\r\n     Mesvinian.\r\n\r\nBelow the Mesvinian comes the nebulous region of \"eoliths,\" which are\r\nnot yet definitely proved to be of human workmanship. The Neanderthal\r\nskull belongs to the Mousterian stage, but the oldest known definitely\r\nhuman remain, the jaw from the Mauer sands near Heidelberg, may be\r\nolder than any of these, indeed by some it is assigned to the first\r\ninterglacial period of Penck and Bruckner (see Note 32). For figures\r\nof the types of implement characterising each period, see \"Guide to the\r\nAntiquities of the Stone Age in the Department of British and Medieval\r\nAntiquities,\" British Museum, 2nd edition, London, 1911, pages 1 to 74.\r\nThis publication gives an admirable summary of recent knowledge on this\r\nsubject. For an excellent and critical summary of the latest researches\r\non Palaeolithic man up till the end of the Aurignacian period, see\r\nDuckworth, \"Prehistoric Man,\" Cambridge, 1912. See also note 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Sir John Evans, K.C.B. (1823-1908), was one of the\r\nforemost authorities on prehistoric archaeology and a prolific writer\r\non the subject. His best known work is \"The Ancient Stone Implements,\r\nWeapons, and Ornaments of Great Britain,\" 2nd edition, 1897.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: By the expression \"Celtic weapons of the stone period\" is\r\npresumably meant Neolithic implements, with polished surfaces.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: It has recently been shown that the growth of peat is a\r\nvery slow process, and at the present time it is in many places either\r\nat a standstill or even in a state of retrogression. In the peat-mosses\r\nof Scotland, Lewis has traced nine successive layers, marked by\r\ndifferent floras. The lowest of these and another at a higher level are\r\ndistinctly of an arctic character, the intermediate forest beds, on the\r\nother hand, indicate periods of milder climate, when the limit of the\r\ngrowth of trees was at a higher level in Scotland than is now the case.\r\nFrom these facts it is certain that the peat-mosses of Scotland and\r\nnorthern England date back at least as far as the later stages of the\r\nglacial period, and indicate at least one mild interglacial episode,\r\nwhen the climate was somewhat warmer than it now is. (See Lewis,\r\n\"Science Progress,\" volume 2, 1907, page 307.) Hence the statements of\r\nthe French workmen, here quoted, do not possess much significance.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Cyrena fluminalis is very abundant in the gravels of an\r\nold terrace of the River Cam, at Barnwell, in the suburbs of Cambridge,\r\nand also in glacial gravels at Kelsey Hill in Holderness. It is a very\r\nremarkable fact that this shell, now an inhabitant of warm regions,\r\nshould be so abundant in these Pleistocene deposits, in close\r\nassociation with glacial accumulations.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: The implement-bearing deposits of Hoxne, in Suffolk, were\r\ninvestigated with great care by a committee of the British Association,\r\nand the results were published in a special and detailed report (\"The\r\nRelation of Palaeolithic Man to the Glacial Epoch,\" \"Report of the\r\nBritish Association,\" Liverpool, 1896, pages 400 to 415). The deposit\r\nconsists of a series of lacustrine or fluviatile strata with plant\r\nremains, some being arctic in character, resting on Chalky Boulder Clay,\r\nand this again on sand. The Palaeolithic deposits are all clearly later\r\nthan the latest boulder-clay of East Anglia, and between their formation\r\nand that of the glacial deposits at least two important climatic changes\r\ntook place, indicating a very considerable lapse of time.\r\n\r\nMention may conveniently be made here of the supposed discovery of the\r\nremains of pre-glacial man at Ipswich, which appears to be founded\r\non errors of observation. The boulder-clay above the interment is,\r\naccording to the best authorities, merely a landslip or flow.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: It has been suggested with a considerable degree of\r\nprobability, that in Auvergne volcanic eruptions persisted even into\r\nhistoric times. The subject is obscure, depending on the interpretation\r\nof difficult passages in two Latin chronicles of the fifth century. The\r\nmost obvious meaning of both passages would certainly appear to be the\r\noccurrence of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, but attempts have\r\nbeen made to explain them as referring to some artificial conflagration,\r\npossibly the burning of a town by an invader. (See Bonney, \"Volcanoes,\"\r\n3rd edition, London, 1913, page 129.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: In the early days of glacial geology in Britain, it\r\nwas commonly accepted that the phenomena could be most satisfactorily\r\nexplained on the hypothesis of a general submergence of the northern\r\nparts of the country to a depth of many hundreds of feet, and this in\r\nspite of the original comparison by Agassiz of the glacial deposits\r\nof Britain to those of the Alps. In later times, however, a school of\r\ngeologists arose who attributed the glaciation of Britain to land-ice\r\nof the Continental or Greenland type. Of late years this school has been\r\ndominant in British geology, with a few notable exceptions, of whom the\r\nmost important is Professor Bonney. The difficulties presented by both\r\ntheories are almost equally great, and at the present time, in spite of\r\nthe vehemence of the supporters of the land-ice theory, it is impossible\r\nto hold any dogmatic views on the subject. Against the doctrine of\r\nsubmergence is the absence of glacial deposits in places where they\r\nwould naturally be expected to occur if the whole of the British Isles\r\nnorth of the Thames and Bristol Channel had been covered by the sea,\r\ntogether with the very general absence of sea-shells in the deposits.\r\nThe objections to the land-ice hypothesis are largely of a mechanical\r\nnature. If we take into account the lateral extent and the thickness\r\nthat can be assigned to the ice-sheet, we are at once confronted by very\r\nconsiderable difficulties as to the sufficiency of the driving-power\r\nbehind the ice. Another great difficulty is the shallowness of the North\r\nSea, in which a comparatively thin mass of ice would run aground at\r\nalmost any point. It has been calculated that the maximum slope of the\r\nsurface of the ice from Norway to the English coast could not exceed\r\nhalf a degree, and it is therefore difficult to see what force could\r\ncompel it to move forward at all, much less to climb steep slopes in the\r\nway postulated by the extremists of this school.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: The most complete account of the geology of the Norfolk\r\ncoast is contained in \"The Geology of Cromer,\" by Clement Reid (\"Memoir\r\nof the Geological Survey\"). (See also Harmer, \"The Pleistocene Period\r\nin the Eastern Counties of England,\" \"Geology in the Field, the Jubilee\r\nVolume of the Geologists Association,\" 1909, chapter 4.). Above the\r\nNorwich Crag several more subdivisions are now recognised, and the\r\ncomplete succession of the Pliocene and Pleistocene strata of East\r\nAnglia may be summarised as follows:--\r\n\r\n     Pleistocene:\r\n     Peat and Alluvium\r\n     Gravel Terraces of the present river systems\r\n     Gravels of the old river-systems\r\n     Plateau gravels\r\n     Chalky boulder-clay\r\n     Interglacial sands and gravels and Contorted Drift\r\n     Cromer Till\r\n     Arctic Plant Bed.\r\n\r\n     Pliocene:\r\n     Cromer Forest Series\r\n     Weybourn Crag\r\n     Chillesford Crag\r\n     Norwich Crag\r\n     Red Crag\r\n     Coralline Crag.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: It is now generally agreed that the tree-stumps in the\r\nCromer Forest bed are not in the position of growth. Many of them are\r\nupside down or lying on their sides, and they were probably floated into\r\ntheir present position by the waters of a river flowing to the north.\r\nThis river was a tributary of the Rhine which then flowed for several\r\nhundred miles over a plain now forming the bed of the North Sea,\r\ncollecting all the drainage of eastern England, and debouching into the\r\nNorth Atlantic somewhere to the south of the Faroe Isles. (See Harmer,\r\n\"The Pleistocene Period in the Eastern Counties of England,\" \"Geological\r\nAssociation Jubilee Volume,\" London, 1909, pages 103 to 123.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Of late years an enormous number of characteristic rocks\r\nfrom Norway and Sweden have been recognised in the drifts of Eastern\r\nEngland, as far south as Essex and Middlesex. One of the most easily\r\nidentifiable types is the well-known Rhombporphyry of the Christiania\r\nFjord, a rock which occurs nowhere else in the world, and is quite\r\nunmistakable in appearance. Along with it are many of the distinctive\r\nsoda-syenites found in the same district, the granites of southern\r\nSweden, and many others. The literature of the subject is very large,\r\nbut many details may be found in the annual reports of the British\r\nAssociation for the last twenty years.]\r\n\r\nFrom a study of these erratics it has been found possible to draw\r\nimportant conclusions as to the direction and sequence of the ice\r\nstreams which flowed over these regions during the different stages of\r\nthe glacial period.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: During his first crossing of Greenland from east to west,\r\nNansen attained a height of 9000 feet on a vast expanse of frozen snow,\r\nand it is believed that towards the north the surface of this great\r\nsnow-plateau rises to even greater elevations. The surface of the snow\r\nis perfectly clean and free from moraine-material. No rock in situ has\r\nbeen seen in the interior of Greenland at a distance greater than 75\r\nmiles from the coast.\r\n\r\nA great amount of valuable information concerning the glacial conditions\r\nof Greenland is to be found in the \"Meddelelser om Gronland,\" a Danish\r\npublication, but containing many summaries in French or English. For\r\na good account of the phenomena seen in the coastal region of the west\r\ncoast, see Drygalski, \"Gronland-Expedition,\" a large monograph published\r\nby the Gesellschaft fur physischen Erdkunde, Berlin, 1897.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: The argument is here considerably understated. The\r\nsouthern point of Greenland, Cape Farewell, is in the same latitude\r\nas the Shetland Islands and Christiania, and only one degree north of\r\nStockholm; Disko is in about the same latitude as the North Cape. Hence\r\nthe inhabited portion of Greenland is in the same latitude as Norway\r\nand Sweden, both fertile and well-populated countries. Even in Central\r\nNorway, in the Gudbrandsdal and Romsdal, thick forests grow up to a\r\nheight of at least 3000 feet above sea-level, a much greater elevation\r\nthan trees now attain in the British Isles. This latter fact is probably\r\nto be attributed to the protective effect of thick snow lying throughout\r\nthe winter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: For a summary of the most recent views as to the\r\nclassification and succession of the glacial deposits of the British\r\nIsles, see Lake an Rastall, \"Textbook of Geology,\" London, 1910, pages\r\n466 to 473. Reference may also be made to Jukes-Browne, \"The Building of\r\nthe British Isles,\" London, 1912, pages 430 to 440.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Glacier-lakes are fairly common among the fjords of the\r\nwest coast of Greenland, and illustrate very well what must have\r\nbeen the state of affairs in Glen Roy at the time of formation of the\r\nParallel Roads.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The high-level shell-bearing deposits of Moel Tryfan,\r\nGloppa, near Oswestry, and Macclesfield, have given rise to much\r\ncontroversy between the supporters of submergence and of land-ice. At\r\nMoel Tryfan certain sands and gravels, with erratics, at a height of\r\nabout 1350 feet, contain abundant marine shells, generally much broken.\r\nThe northern or seaward face of the hill is much plastered with drift,\r\nbut none is to be found on the landward side, and it is suggested that\r\nthe shell-bearing material is the ground-moraine of a great ice-sheet\r\nthat came in from the Irish Sea, and was forced up on to the Welsh\r\ncoast, just reaching the watershed, but failing to overtop it. With\r\nregard to the explanation by submergence, the great objection is the\r\nabsence of marine drift on the landward side, which is very difficult to\r\nexplain if the whole had been submerged sufficiently to allow of normal\r\nmarine deposits at such a great height. The shell beds of Macclesfield\r\nand Gloppa are at a less elevation but of essentially similar character.\r\n\r\nThe shell-bearing deposits of Moel Tryfan were examined by a committee\r\nof the British Association. (See \"Report of the British Association\"\r\nDover, 1899, pages 414 to 423.) At the end of this report is an\r\nextensive bibliography.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: During the last forty years the deep-sea dredging\r\nexpeditions of H. M.S. Challenger and others have shown the abundance\r\nand variety of animal life at great depths, especially in the Arctic and\r\nAntarctic seas. For a recent summary, see Murray and Hjort, \"The Depths\r\nof the Ocean,\" London, 1912.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: It is now generally admitted that these shell-beds in\r\nWexford are of Pliocene age, and they therefore have no bearing on the\r\nsubject under discussion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: The boulder deposit at Selsey has been described by Mr.\r\nClement Reid (\"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,\" volume 48,\r\n1892, page 355). Immediately above the Tertiary beds is a hard greenish\r\nclay, full of derived Tertiary fossils and Pleistocene shells with large\r\nflints and erratic blocks, some of the latter weighing several tons.\r\nThey include granite, greenstone, schist, slate, quartzite, and\r\nsandstone, and most of them must have been transported for a long\r\ndistance. Above them are black muds with marine shells, then a shingle\r\nbeach, and above all the Coombe Rock. (See next note.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: The Brighton elephant-bed and its equivalent, the Coombe\r\nRock, are fully described by Clement Reid (\"On the Origin of Dry Chalk\r\nValleys and the Coombe Rock,\" \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological\r\nSociety,\" volume 43, 1887, page 364). The Coombe Rock is a mass of\r\nunstratified flints and Chalk debris filling the lower parts of the\r\ndry valleys (Coombes) of the South Downs and gradually passing into\r\nthe brick-earth (loam) of the coastal plain. It is clearly a torrential\r\naccumulation, and is supposed to have been formed while the Chalk was\r\nfrozen, thus preventing percolation of water and causing the surface\r\nwater to run off as strong streams. This must have occurred during some\r\npart of the glacial period, which would naturally be a period of heavy\r\nprecipitation. Of very similar origin is the \"Head\" of Cornwall, a\r\nsurface deposit often rich in tinstone and other minerals of economic\r\nvalue. The Coombe Rock has recently been correlated with deposits of\r\nMousterian Age.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: The former extension of the Alpine glaciers and the\r\ndeposits formed by them have been exhaustively investigated by Penck\r\nand Bruckner (\"Die Alpen im Eiszeitalter,\" 3 volumes, Leipzig, 1901 to\r\n1909). In this monumental work the authors claim to have established the\r\noccurrence of four periods of advance of the ice, to which they give the\r\nnames of Gunz, Mindel, Riss, and Wurm glaciations, with corresponding\r\ninterglacial genial episodes, when the climate was possibly even\r\nsomewhat warmer than now. Their conclusions and the data on which they\r\nare established are summarised by Sollas (\" Ancient Hunters,\" London,\r\n1911, especially pages 18 to 28). For a general account of the glaciers\r\nof the Alps and their accompanying phenomena, see Bonney, \"The Building\r\nof the Alps,\" London, 1912, pages 103 to 151.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: At the time of the maximum advance of the ice, during the\r\nRiss period of Penck and Bruckner, the terminal moraine of the great\r\nglacier of the Rhone extended as far as the city of Lyon, and towards\r\nthe north-east it became continuous with the similar moraine of the\r\nRhine glacier.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: For the successive phases of advance and retreat of the\r\nAlpine glaciers, see the works quoted in Note 32.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: The Loess of Central Europe includes deposits of two\r\ndifferent ages. According to Penck the \"Older Loess\" was formed in the\r\nperiod of warm and dry climate that intervened between the third and\r\nfourth glacial episodes, while the \"Younger Loess\" is post-glacial.\r\nBoth divisions are for the most part aeolian deposits, formed by the\r\nredistribution of fine glacial mud originally laid down in water and\r\ncarried by the wind often to considerable heights. A part, however, of\r\nthe so-called Loess of northern France, e.g. in the valley of the\r\nSomme, is rain-wash, similar in character to the brick-earth of parts\r\nof south-eastern England. The Older Loess contains Acheulean implements,\r\nwhile the Younger Loess is of Aurignacian Age.\r\n\r\nThe greatest development of the Loess is in Central Asia and in China.\r\n(See Richthofen, \"China,\" Berlin, 1877.) In China the Loess reaches\r\na thickness of several thousand feet, and whole mountain-ranges are\r\nsometimes almost completely buried in it. In the deserts of Central Asia\r\nthe formation of the Loess is still in progress. A very similar deposit,\r\ncalled adobe, is also found in certain parts of the Mississippi valley.\r\n\r\nThe Loess is a fine calcareous silt or clay of a yellowish colour, quite\r\nsoft and crumbling between the fingers. However, it resists denudation\r\nin a remarkable manner, and in China it often stands up in vertical\r\nwalls hundreds of feet in height. This property is probably assisted by\r\nthe presence of numerous fine tubes arranged vertically and lined with\r\ncalcium carbonate; these are supposed to have been formed in the first\r\nplace by fibrous rootlets.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Although highly probable, it cannot yet be regarded as\r\nconclusively demonstrated that the Pleistocene glaciations of Europe and\r\nof North America were exactly contemporaneous. The ice--sheets in each\r\ncase radiated from independent centres which were not in the extreme\r\nnorth of either continent, and were not in any way connected with a\r\ngeneral polar ice-cap. The European centre was over the Baltic region or\r\nthe south of Scandinavia, and the American centre in the neighbourhood\r\nof Hudson's Bay. The southern margin of the American ice-sheet extended\r\nabout as far south as latitude 38 degrees north in the area lying south\r\nof the Great Lakes, whereas the North European ice barely passed the\r\nlimit of 50 degrees north in Central Europe. This greater southward\r\nextension in America was doubtless correlated with the same causes\r\nas now produce the low winter temperatures of the eastern states,\r\nespecially the cold Newfoundland current. The literature of North\r\nAmerican glacial geology has now attained colossal dimensions, and it is\r\nimpossible to give here even a short abstract of the main conclusions.\r\nFor a general summary reference may be made to Chamberlin and Salisbury,\r\n\"Geology,\" volume 3; \"Earth History,\" London and New York, 1905; or the\r\nsame authors' \"Geology, Shorter Course,\" London and New York, 1909.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: During the last fifty years scarcely any geological\r\nsubject has given rise to a greater amount of speculation than the cause\r\nof the Ice Age, and the solution of the problem is still apparently far\r\noff. The theories put forward may for convenience be divided into three\r\ngroups, namely astronomical, geographical, and meteorological.\r\n\r\nAs examples of astronomical explanation, we may take the well-known\r\ntheory of Adhemar and Crohl, which is founded on changes in the\r\nellipticity of the earth's orbit. This is expounded and amplified by Sir\r\nRobert Ball in his \"Cause of an Ice Age.\" The weak point of this theory,\r\nwhich is mathematically unassailable, is that it proves too much,\r\nand postulates a constant succession of glacial periods throughout\r\nearth-history, and for this there is no evidence. The geographical\r\nexplanations are chiefly founded on supposed changes in the distribution\r\nof sea and land, with consequent diversion of cold and warm currents.\r\nAnother suggestion is that the glaciated areas had undergone elevation\r\ninto mountain regions, but this is in conflict with evidence for\r\nsubmergence beneath the sea in certain cases. Meteorological hypotheses,\r\nsuch as that of Harmer, founded on a different arrangement of air\r\npressures and wind-directions, seem to offer the most promising field\r\nfor exploration and future work, but it is clear that much still remains\r\nto be explained.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: The reptile-bearing Elgin Sandstones are of Triassic Age,\r\nand they contain a most remarkable assemblage of strange and eccentric\r\nforms, especially Anomodont reptiles resembling those found in the\r\nKarroo formation of South Africa.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: The meaning of this statement is not very clear. The\r\nConifers are not dicotyledons: their seeds contain numerous cotyledons,\r\nup to twenty in number, and the whole plant, and especially the\r\nreproductive system, belongs to a lower stage of development. The\r\nargument here employed is therefore fallacious, and in point of fact the\r\ndifferent groups actually appeared in the order postulated by the\r\ntheory of evolution, namely: (1) Gymnosperms, (2) Monocotyledons,\r\n(3) Dicotyledons. See Arber, \"The Origin of Gymnosperms,\" \"Science\r\nProgress,\" volume 1, 1906, pages 222 to 237.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: The part of the manuscript read to Dr. Hooker in 1844\r\nwas undoubtedly the \"Essay of 1844,\" forming the second part of the\r\n\"Foundations of the Origin of Species,\" a volume published by Sir\r\nFrancis Darwin on the occasion of the Darwin Centenary at Cambridge in\r\n1909. (See also Darwin's \"Life and Letters,\" volume 2 pages 16 to 18.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: This projected larger work, which is often referred to in\r\nthe \"Origin of Species,\" was never published as such, but Darwin's views\r\non various aspects of evolution were set forth in several later books,\r\nsuch as \"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,\" \"The\r\nDescent of Man,\" \"Various Contrivances by which Orchids are Fertilised\r\nby Insects,\" \"Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants,\" \"Insectivorous\r\nPlants,\" and others.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: With this section compare the famous chapter with the same\r\ntitle in the \"Origin of Species.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: No attempt has been made to annotate this chapter, owing\r\nto the impossibility of doing so within reasonable compass. Many of\r\nthe theories here quoted, and the conclusions drawn from them, have\r\nnot stood the test of time, and recent philological and ethnographical\r\nresearch have clearly shown the danger of attempting to infer\r\nthe relationships of different peoples from their languages. The\r\nmodifications undergone by the languages themselves are also subject\r\nto influences of such complex character, so largely artificial in their\r\norigin, that any attempt to compare them with natural evolution in the\r\norganic world must lead to false analogies. The chapter must be regarded\r\nas an interesting exposition of one phase of Mid-Victorian scientific\r\nthought, but having little real bearing on the subjects discussed in the\r\nrest of the book.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: That the prophecy here given was justified is shown by\r\nthe discovery in Java in 1891, of the skull and parts of the skeleton\r\nof Pithecanthropus erectus, a form which, according to the best\r\nauthorities, must be regarded as in many ways intermediate between\r\nman and the apes, though perhaps with more human than ape-like\r\ncharacteristics. For an account of the circumstances of its discovery\r\nand a general description of the remains, see Sollas, \"Ancient Hunters,\"\r\nLondon, 1911, pages 30 to 39 (with many references). Within the last\r\nyear or two interest in the ancestry of man has been greatly increased,\r\nespecially by the Piltdown discovery (see Note 11). This has led to\r\na revision of the whole subject, and the views formerly held have\r\nundergone a certain amount of modification. It now seems certain that\r\nthe different types of culture as represented by the succession of\r\nstages given in Note 12 do not correspond to a continuous development of\r\none single race of mankind. There is, undoubtedly, a great break between\r\nthe Mousterian and Aurignacian. Mousterian or Neanderthal man appears to\r\nhave become extinct, possibly having been exterminated by a migration of\r\nthe more highly developed Aurignacian race, which may be regarded as the\r\nancestor of modern man in Europe. It appears, therefore, that the really\r\nimportant line of division comes, not as was formerly thought between\r\nPalaeolithic and Neolithic, but in the middle of the Palaeolithic\r\nbetween Mousterian and Aurignacian. Hence it appears that our\r\nclassification will in the near future have to undergo revision, since\r\nthe stages of culture from Aurignacian to Azilian show a much closer\r\naffinity to the Neolithic than they do to the earlier Palaeolithic. At\r\nthe present time scarcely sufficient data are available to determine the\r\nrelationship of Pithecanthropus and Eoanthropus to the later types of\r\nman.
