We perceive a fabric, erected in wisdom, to\r\nobtain a purpose worthy of the power that is apparent in the production\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nWe know little of the earth's internal parts, or of the materials which\r\ncompose it at any considerable depth below the surface. But upon the\r\nsurface of this globe, the more inert matter is replenished with plants,\r\nand with animal and intellectual beings.\r\n\r\nWhere so many living creatures are to ply their respective powers, in\r\npursuing the end for which they were intended, we are not to look for\r\nnature in a quiescent state; matter itself must be in motion, and the\r\nscenes of life a continued or repeated series of agitations and events.\r\n\r\nThis globe of the earth is a habitable world; and on its fitness for\r\nthis purpose, our sense of wisdom in its formation must depend. To judge\r\nof this point, we must keep in view, not only the end, but the means\r\nalso by which that end is obtained. These are, the form of the whole,\r\nthe materials of which it is composed, and the several powers which\r\nconcur, counteract, or balance one another, in procuring the general\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe form and constitution of the mass are not more evidently calculated\r\nfor the purpose of this earth as a habitable world, than are the various\r\nsubstances of which that complicated body is composed. Soft and hard\r\nparts variously combine to form a medium consistence, adapted to the use\r\nof plants and animals; wet and dry are properly mixed for nutrition,\r\nor the support of those growing bodies; and hot and cold produce a\r\ntemperature or climate no less required than a soil: Insomuch, that\r\nthere is not any particular, respecting either the qualities of the\r\nmaterials, or the construction of the machine, more obvious to\r\nour perception, than are the presence and efficacy of design and\r\nintelligence in the power that conducts the work.\r\n\r\nIn taking this view of things, where ends and means are made the object\r\nof attention, we may hope to find a principle upon which the comparative\r\nimportance of parts in the system of nature may be estimated, and also\r\na rule for selecting the object of our inquiries. Under this direction,\r\nscience may find a fit subject of investigation in every particular,\r\nwhether of _form_, _quality_, or _active power_, that presents itself in\r\nthis system of motion and of life; and which, without a proper\r\nattention to this character of the system, might appear anomalous and\r\nincomprehensible.\r\n\r\nIt is not only by seeing those general operations of the globe which\r\ndepend upon its peculiar construction as a machine, but also by\r\nperceiving how far the particulars, in the construction of that machine,\r\ndepend upon the general operations of the globe, that we are enabled to\r\nunderstand the constitution of this earth as a thing formed by design.\r\nWe shall thus also be led to acknowledge an order, not unworthy of\r\nDivine wisdom, in a subject which, in another view, has appeared as the\r\nwork of chance, or as absolute disorder and confusion.\r\n\r\nTo acquire a general or comprehensive view of this mechanism of the\r\nglobe, by which it is adapted to the purpose of being a habitable world,\r\nit is necessary to distinguish three different bodies which compose the\r\nwhole. These are, a solid body of earth, an aqueous body of sea, and an\r\nelastic fluid of air.\r\n\r\nIt is the proper shape and disposition of these three bodies that form\r\nthis globe into a habitable world; and it is the manner in which these\r\nconstituent bodies are adjusted to each other, and the laws of action\r\nby which they are maintained in their proper qualities and respective\r\ndepartments, that form the Theory of the machine which we are now to\r\nexamine.\r\n\r\nLet us begin with some general sketch of the particulars now mentioned.\r\n\r\n_1st_, There is a central body in the globe. This body supports those\r\nparts which come to be more immediately exposed to our view, or which\r\nmay be examined by our sense and observation. This first part is\r\ncommonly supposed to be solid and inert; but such a conclusion is only\r\nmere conjecture; and we shall afterwards find occasion, perhaps, to form\r\nanother judgment in relation to this subject, after we have examined\r\nstrictly, upon scientific principles, what appears upon the surface, and\r\nhave formed conclusions concerning that which must have been transacted\r\nin some more central part.\r\n\r\n_2dly_, We find a fluid body of water. This, by gravitation, is reduced\r\nto a spherical form, and by the centrifugal force of the earth's\r\nrotation, is become oblate. The purpose of this fluid body is essential\r\nin the constitution of the world; for, besides affording the means of\r\nlife and motion to a multifarious race of animals, it is the source of\r\ngrowth and circulation to the organized bodies of this earth, in being\r\nthe receptacle of the rivers, and the fountain of our vapours.\r\n\r\n_3dly_, We have an irregular body of land raised above the level of the\r\nocean. This, no doubt, is the smallest portion of the globe; but it is\r\nthe part to us by far most interesting. It is upon the surface of this\r\npart that plants are made to grow; consequently, it is by virtue of\r\nthis land that animal life, as well as vegetation, is sustained in this\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n_Lastly_, We have a surrounding body of atmosphere, which completes the\r\nglobe. This vital fluid is no less necessary, in the constitution of the\r\nworld, than are the other parts; for there is hardly an operation upon\r\nthe surface of the earth, that is not conducted or promoted by its\r\nmeans. It is a necessary condition for the sustenance of fire; it is the\r\nbreath of life to animals; it is at least an instrument in vegetation;\r\nand, while it contributes to give fertility and health to things that\r\ngrow, it is employed in preventing noxious effects from such as go into\r\ncorruption. In short, it is the proper means of circulation for the\r\nmatter of this world, by raising up the water of the ocean, and pouring\r\nit forth upon the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nSuch is the mechanism of the globe: Let us now mention some of those\r\npowers by which motion is produced, and activity procured to the mere\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nFirst, There is the progressive force, or moving power, by which this\r\nplanetary body, if solely actuated, would depart continually from the\r\npath which it now pursues, and thus be for ever removed from its end,\r\nwhether as a planetary body, or as a globe sustaining plants and\r\nanimals, which may be termed a living world.\r\n\r\nBut this moving body is also actuated by gravitation, which inclines\r\nit directly to the central body of the sun. Thus it is made to revolve\r\nabout that luminary, and to preserve its path.\r\n\r\nIt is also upon the same principles, that each particular part upon the\r\nsurface of this globe, is alternately exposed to the influence of light\r\nand darkness, in the diurnal rotation of the earth, as well as in its\r\nannual revolution. In this manner are produced the vicissitudes of night\r\nand day, so variable in the different latitudes from the equator to the\r\npole, and so beautifully calculated to equalise the benefits of light,\r\nso variously distributed in the different regions of the globe.\r\n\r\nGravitation, and the _vis infita_ of matter, thus form the first two\r\npowers distinguishable in the operations of our system, and wisely\r\nadapted to the purpose for which they are employed.\r\n\r\nWe next observe the influence of light and heat, of cold and\r\ncondensation. It is by means of these two powers that the various\r\noperations of this living world are more immediately transacted;\r\nalthough the other powers are no less required, in order to produce or\r\nmodify these great agents in the economy of life, and system of our\r\nchanging things.\r\n\r\nWe do not now inquire into the nature of those powers, or investigate\r\nthe laws of light and heat, of cold and condemnation, by which the\r\nvarious purposes of this world are accomplished; we are only to mention\r\nthose effects which are made sensible to the common understanding of\r\nmankind, and which necessarily imply a power that is employed. Thus,\r\nit is by the operation of those powers that the varieties of season\r\nin spring and autumn are obtained, that we are blessed with the\r\nvicissitudes of summer's heat and winter's cold, and that we possess the\r\nbenefit of artificial light and culinary fire.\r\n\r\nWe are thus bountifully provided with the necessaries of life; we are\r\nsupplied with things conducive to the growth and preservation of our\r\nanimal nature, and with fit subjects to employ and to nourish our\r\nintellectual powers.\r\n\r\nThere are other actuating powers employed in the operations of this\r\nglobe, which we are little more than able to enumerate; such are those\r\nof electricity, magnetism, and subterraneous heat or mineral fire.\r\n\r\nPowers of such magnitude or force, are not to be supposed useless in a\r\nmachine contrived surely not without wisdom; but they are mentioned here\r\nchiefly on account of their general effect; and it is sufficient to have\r\nnamed powers, of which the actual existence is well known, but of which\r\nthe proper use in the constitution of the world is still obscure.\r\nThe laws of electricity and magnetism have been well examined by\r\nphilosophers; but the purposes of those powers in the economy of the\r\nglobe have not been discovered. Subterraneous fire, again, although the\r\nmost conspicuous in the operations of this world, and often examined by\r\nphilosophers, is a power which has been still less understood, whether\r\nwith regard to its efficient or final cause. It has hitherto appeared\r\nmore like the accident of natural things, than the inherent property of\r\nthe mineral region. It is in this last light, however, that I wish to\r\nexhibit it, as a great power acting a material part in the operations of\r\nthe globe, and as an essential part in the constitution of this world.\r\n\r\nWe have thus surveyed the machine in general, with those moving powers,\r\nby which its operations, diversified almost _ad infinitum_, are\r\nperformed. Let us now confine our view, more particularly, to that part\r\nof the machine on which we dwell, that so we may consider the natural\r\nconsequences of those operations which, being within our view, we are\r\nbetter qualified to examine.\r\n\r\nThis subject is important to the human race, to the possessor of this\r\nworld, to the intelligent being Man, who foresees events to come, and\r\nwho, in contemplating his future interest, is led to inquire concerning\r\ncauses, in order that he may judge of events which otherwise he could\r\nnot know.\r\n\r\nIf, in pursuing this object, we employ our skill in research, not in\r\nforming vain conjectures; and if _data_ are to be found, on which\r\nScience may form just conclusions, we should not long remain in\r\nignorance with respect to the natural history of this earth, a subject\r\non which hitherto opinion only, and not evidence, has decided: For in no\r\nsubject, perhaps, is there naturally less defect of evidence, although\r\nphilosophers, led by prejudice, or misguided by false theory, may have\r\nneglected to employ that light by which they should have seen the system\r\nof this world.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed in pursuing a little farther our general or preparatory\r\nideas. A solid body of land could not have answered the purpose of a\r\nhabitable world; for, a soil is necessary to the growth of plants; and a\r\nsoil is nothing but the materials collected from the destruction of the\r\nsolid land. Therefore, the surface of this land, inhabited by man,\r\nand covered with plants and animals, is made by nature to decay, in\r\ndissolving from that hard and, compact state in which it is found below\r\nthe soil; and this soil is necessarily washed away, by the continual\r\ncirculation of the water, running from the summits of the mountains\r\ntowards the general receptacle of that fluid. The heights of our land\r\nare thus levelled with the shores; our fertile plains are formed from the\r\nruins of the mountains; and those travelling materials are still pursued\r\nby the moving water, and propelled along the inclined surface of the\r\nearth[1] These moveable materials, delivered into the sea, cannot, for\r\na long continuance, rest upon the shore; for, by the agitation of the\r\nwinds, the tides and currents, every moveable thing is carried\r\nfarther and farther along the shelving bottom of the sea, towards the\r\nunfathomable regions of the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: M. de Luc, in his second letter to me, published in the Monthly\r\nReview for 1790, says, \"You ought to have proved that both gravel and\r\nsand are carried from our continents to the sea; which, on the contrary,\r\nI shall prove not to be the case.\" He then endeavours to prove his\r\nassertion, by observing, that, in certain places where there is not\r\neither sufficient declivity in the surface, or force in the running\r\nwater, gravel and sand are made to rest, and do not travel to the sea.\r\nThis surely is a fact to which I most readily assent; but, on the other\r\nhand, I hope he will acknowledge, that, where there is sufficient\r\ndeclivity in the surface, or force in the running water, sand, gravel,\r\nand stones, are travelled upon the land, and are thus carried into the\r\nsea--at last. This is all that my theory requires, and this is what I\r\nbelieve will be admitted, without any farther proof on my part.]\r\n\r\nIf the vegetable soil is thus constantly removed from the surface of the\r\nland, and if its place is thus to be supplied from the dissolution of\r\nthe solid earth, as here represented, we may perceive an end to this\r\nbeautiful machine; an end, arising from no error in its constitution as\r\na world, but from that destructibility of its land which is so necessary\r\nin the system of the globe, in the economy of life and vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe immense time necessarily required for this total destruction of\r\nthe land, must not be opposed to that view of future events, which is\r\nindicated by the surest facts, and most approved principles. Time, which\r\nmeasures every thing in our idea, and is often deficient to our schemes,\r\nis to nature endless and as nothing; it cannot limit that by which alone\r\nit had existence; and, as the natural course of time, which to us seems\r\ninfinite, cannot be bounded by any operation that may have an end, the\r\nprogress of things upon this globe, that is, the course of nature,\r\ncannot be limited by time, which must proceed in a continual succession.\r\nWe are, therefore, to consider as inevitable the deduction of our land,\r\nso far as effected by those operations which are necessary in the\r\npurpose of the globe, considered as a habitable world; and, so far as\r\nwe have not examined any other part of the economy of nature, in which\r\nother operations and a different intention might appear.\r\n\r\nWe have now considered the globe of this earth as a machine, constructed\r\nupon chemical as well as mechanical principles, by which its different\r\nparts are all adapted, in form, in quality, and in quantity, to a\r\ncertain end; an end attained with certainty or success; and an end from\r\nwhich we may perceive wisdom, in contemplating the means employed.\r\n\r\nBut is this world to be considered thus merely as a machine, to last no\r\nlonger than its parts retain their present position, their proper forms\r\nand qualities? Or may it not be also considered as an organized body?\r\nsuch as has a constitution in which the necessary decay of the machine\r\nis naturally repaired, in the exertion of those productive powers by\r\nwhich it had been formed.\r\n\r\nThis is the view in which we are now to examine the globe; to see if\r\nthere be, in the constitution of this world, a reproductive operation,\r\nby which a ruined constitution may be again repaired, and a duration or\r\nstability thus procured to the machine, considered as a world sustaining\r\nplants and animals.\r\n\r\nIf no such reproductive power, or reforming operation, after due\r\ninquiry, is to be found in the constitution of this world, we should\r\nhave reason to conclude, that the system of this earth has either been\r\nintentionally made imperfect, or has not been the work of infinite power\r\nand wisdom.\r\n\r\nHere is an important question, therefore, with regard to the\r\nconstitution of this globe; a question which, perhaps, it is in\r\nthe power of man's sagacity to resolve; and a question which, if\r\nsatisfactorily resolved, might add some lustre to science and the human\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nAnimated with this great, this interesting view, let us strictly examine\r\nour principles, in order to avoid fallacy in our reasoning; and let us\r\nendeavour to support our attention, in developing a subject that is\r\nvast in its extent, as well as intricate in the relation of parts to be\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nThe globe of this earth is evidently made for man. He alone, of all the\r\nbeings which have life upon this body, enjoys the whole and every part;\r\nhe alone is capable of knowing the nature of this world, which he thus\r\npossesses in virtue of his proper right; and he alone can make the\r\nknowledge of this system a source of pleasure, and the means of\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nMan alone, of all the animated beings which enjoy the benefits of this\r\nearth, employs the knowledge which he there receives, in leading him to\r\njudge of the intention of things, as well as of the means by which they\r\nare brought about; and he alone is thus made to enjoy, in contemplation\r\nas well as sensual pleasure, all the good that may be observed in the\r\nconstitution of this world; he, therefore, should be made the first\r\nsubject of inquiry.\r\n\r\nNow, if we are to take the written history of man for the rule by which\r\nwe should judge of the time when the species first began, that period\r\nwould be but little removed from the present state of things. The Mosaic\r\nhistory places this beginning of man at no great distance; and there\r\nhas not been found, in natural history, any document by which a high\r\nantiquity might be attributed to the human race. But this is not the\r\ncase with regard to the inferior species of animals, particularly those\r\nwhich inhabit the ocean and its shores. We find, in natural history,\r\nmonuments which prove that those animals had long existed; and we thus\r\nprocure a measure for the computation of a period of time extremely\r\nremote, though far from being precisely ascertained.\r\n\r\nIn examining things present, we have data from which to reason with\r\nregard to what has been; and, from what has actually been, we have\r\ndata for concluding with regard to that which is to happen hereafter.\r\nTherefore, upon the supposition that the operations of nature are\r\nequable and steady, we find, in natural appearances, means for\r\nconcluding a certain portion of time to have necessarily elapsed, in the\r\nproduction of those events of which we see the effects.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that, in finding the relics of sea-animals of every kind\r\nin the solid body of our earth, a natural history of those animals\r\nis formed, which includes a certain portion of time; and, for the\r\nascertaining this portion of time, we must again have recourse to the\r\nregular operations of this world. We shall thus arrive at facts which\r\nindicate a period to which no other species of chronology is able to\r\nremount.\r\n\r\nIn what follows, therefore, we are to examine the construction of the\r\npresent earth, in order to understand the natural operations of time\r\npast; to acquire principles, by which we may conclude with regard to the\r\nfuture course of things, or judge of those operations, by which a world,\r\nso wisely ordered, goes into decay; and to learn, by what means such a\r\ndecayed world may be renovated, or the waste of habitable land upon the\r\nglobe repaired.\r\n\r\nThis, therefore, is the object which we are to have in view during this\r\nphysical investigation; this is the end to which are to be directed all\r\nthe steps in our cosmological pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe solid parts of the globe are, in general, composed of sand, of\r\ngravel, of argillaceous and calcareous strata, or of the various\r\ncompositions of these with some other substances, which it is not\r\nnecessary now to mention. Sand is separated and sized by streams and\r\ncurrents; gravel is formed by the mutual attrition of stones agitated\r\nin water; and marly, or argillaceous strata, have been collected, by\r\nsubsiding in water with which those earthy substances had been floated.\r\nThus, so far as the earth is formed of these materials, that solid body\r\nwould appear to have been the production of water, winds, and tides.\r\n\r\nBut that which renders the original of our land clear and evident,\r\nis the immense quantities of calcareous bodies which had belonged\r\nto animals, and the intimate connection of these masses of animal\r\nproduction with the other strata of the land. For it is to be proved,\r\nthat all these calcareous bodies, from the collection of which the\r\nstrata were formed, have belonged to the sea, and were produced in it.\r\n\r\nWe find the marks of marine animals in the most solid parts of the\r\nearth; consequently, those solid parts have been formed after the ocean\r\nwas inhabited by those animals which are proper to that fluid medium.\r\nIf, therefore, we knew the natural history of those solid parts, and\r\ncould trace the operations of the globe, by which they had been formed,\r\nwe would have some means for computing the time through which those\r\nspecies of animals have continued to live. But how shall we describe a\r\nprocess which nobody has seen performed, and of which no written\r\nhistory gives any account? This is only to be investigated, _first_, in\r\nexamining the nature of those solid bodies, the history of which we want\r\nto know; and, 2_dly_, In examining the natural operations of the globe,\r\nin order to see if there now actually exist such operations, as, from\r\nthe nature of the solid bodies, appear to have been necessary to their\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nBut, before entering more particularly into those points of discussion,\r\nby which the question is to be resolved, let us take a general view of\r\nthe subject, in order to see what it is which science and observation\r\nmust decide.\r\n\r\nIn all the regions of the globe, immense masses are found, which, though\r\nat present in the most solid state, appear to have been formed by the\r\ncollection of the calcareous _exuviae_ of marine animals. The question\r\nat present is not, in what manner those collections of calcareous relics\r\nhave become a perfect solid body, and have been changed from an animal\r\nto a mineral substance; for this is a subject that will be afterwards\r\nconsidered; we are now only inquiring, if such is truly the origin of\r\nthose mineral masses.\r\n\r\nThat all the masses of marble or limestone are composed of the\r\ncalcareous matter of marine bodies, may be concluded from the following\r\nfacts:\r\n\r\n1_st_, There are few beds of marble or limestone, in which may not be\r\nfound some of those objects which indicate the marine origin of the\r\nmass. If, for example, in a mass of marble, taken from a quarry upon the\r\ntop of the Alps or Andes[2], there shall be found one cockle-shell, or\r\npiece of coral, it must be concluded, that this bed of stone had been\r\noriginally formed at the bottom of the sea, as much as another bed which\r\nis evidently composed almost altogether of cockle-shells and coral. If\r\none bed of limestone is thus found to have been of a marine origin,\r\nevery concomitant bed of the same kind must be also concluded to have\r\nbeen formed in the same Manner.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: \"Cette sommité élevée de 984 toises au dessus de notre lac, et\r\npar conséquent de 1172 au dessus de la mer, est remarquable en ce que\r\nl'on y voit des fragmens d'huîtres pétrifiés.--Cette montagne est\r\ndominée par un rocher escarpé, qui s'il n'est pas inaccessible, est du\r\nmoins d'un bien difficile accès; il paroît presqu'entièrement composé\r\nde coquillages pétrifiés, renfermés dans un roc calcaire, ou marbre\r\ngrossier noirâtre. Les fragmens qui s'en détachent, et que l'on\r\nrencontre en montant à la Croix de fer, sont remplis de _turbinites_ de\r\ndifférentes espèces.\" M. DE SAUSSURE, _Voyage dans les Alpes_, p. 394.]\r\n\r\nWe thus shall find the greatest part of the calcareous masses upon this\r\nglobe to have originated from marine calcareous bodies; for whether\r\nwe examine marbles, limestones, or such solid masses as are perfectly\r\nchanged from the state of earth, and are become compact and hard, or\r\nwhether we examine the soft, earthy, chalky or marly strata, of which so\r\nmuch of this earth is composed, we still find evident proofs, that those\r\nbeds had their origin from materials deposited at the bottom of the sea;\r\nand that they have the calcareous substance which they contain, from the\r\nsame source as the marbles or the limestones.\r\n\r\n2_dly_, In those calcareous strata, which are evidently of marine\r\norigin, there are many parts that are of a sparry structure, that is\r\nto say, the original texture of those beds, in such places, has been\r\ndissolved, and a new structure has been assumed, which is peculiar to\r\na certain state of the calcareous earth. This change is produced by\r\ncrystallisation, in consequence of a previous state of fluidity, which\r\nhas so disposed the concreting parts, as to allow them to assume a\r\nregular shape and structure proper to that substance. A body, whose\r\nexternal form has been modified by this process, is called a _crystal_;\r\none whose internal arrangement of parts is determined by it, is said to\r\nbe of a _sparry structure_; and this is known from its fracture.\r\n\r\n3_dly_, There are, in all the regions of the earth, huge masses of\r\ncalcareous matter, in that crystalline form of sparry state, in\r\nwhich perhaps no vestige can be found of any organised body, nor any\r\nindication that such calcareous matter had belonged to animals; but\r\nas, in other masses, this sparry structure, or crystalline state, is\r\nevidently assumed by the marine calcareous substances, in operations\r\nwhich are natural to the globe, and which are necessary to the\r\nconsolidation of the strata, it does not appear, that the sparry masses,\r\nin which no figured body is formed, have been originally different from\r\nother masses, which, being only crystallised in part, and in part still\r\nretaining their original form, leave ample evidence of their marine\r\norigin[3].\r\n\r\n[Note 3: M. de Saussure, describing the marble of Aigle, says, \"Les\r\ntables polies de ce marbre présentent fréquemment des coquillages, dont\r\nla plupart sont des peignes striés, et de très-beaux madrépores. Tous\r\nces corps marins on pris entierement la nature et le grain même\r\ndu marbre, on n'y voit presque jamais la coquille sous sa forme\r\noriginaire.\"]\r\n\r\nWe are led, in this manner, to conclude, that all the strata of the\r\nearth, not only those consisting of such calcareous masses, but others\r\nsuperincumbent upon these, have had their origin at the bottom of the\r\nsea, by the collection of sand and gravel, of shells, of coralline\r\nand crustaceous bodies, and of earths and clays, variously mixed,\r\nor separated and accumulated. Here is a general conclusion, well\r\nauthenticated in the appearances of nature, and highly important in the\r\nnatural history of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe general amount of our reasoning is this, that nine-tenths, perhaps,\r\nor ninety-nine hundredths of this earth, so far as we see, have\r\nbeen formed by natural operations of the globe, in collecting loose\r\nmaterials, and depositing them at the bottom of the sea; consolidating\r\nthose collections in various degrees, and either elevating those\r\nconsolidated masses above the level on which they were formed, or\r\nlowering the level of that sea.\r\n\r\nThere is a part of the solid earth which we may at present neglect, not\r\nas being persuaded that this part may not also be found to come under\r\nthe general rule of formation with the rest, but as considering this\r\npart to be of no consequence in forming a general rule, which shall\r\ncomprehend almost the whole, without doing it absolutely. This excluded\r\npart consists of certain mountains and masses of granite. These are\r\nthought to be still older in their formation, and are said never to\r\nbe found superincumbent on strata which must be acknowledged as the\r\nproductions of the sea.\r\n\r\nHaving thus found the greater part, if not the whole, of the solid land\r\nto have been originally composed at the bottom of the sea, we may now,\r\nin order to form a proper idea of these operations, suppose the whole of\r\nthis seaborn land to be again dispersed along the bottom of the ocean,\r\nthe surface of which would rise proportionally over the globe. We would\r\nthus have a spheroid of water, with granite rocks and islands scattered\r\nhere and there. But this would not be the world which we inhabit;\r\ntherefore, the question now is, how such continents, as we actually have\r\nupon the globe, could be erected above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt must be evident, that no motion of the sea, caused by this earth\r\nrevolving in the solar system, could bring about that end; for let us\r\nsuppose the axis of the earth to be changed from the present poles, and\r\nplaced in the equinoctial line, the consequence of this might, indeed,\r\nbe the formation of a continent of land about each new pole, from whence\r\nthe sea would run towards the new equator; but all the rest of the globe\r\nwould remain an ocean. Some new points might be discovered, and others,\r\nwhich before appeared above the surface of the sea, would be sunk by\r\nthe rising of the water; but, on the whole, land could only be gained\r\nsubstantially at the poles. Such a supposition, as this, if applied to\r\nthe present state of things, would be destitute of every support, as\r\nbeing incapable of explaining what appears.\r\n\r\nBut even allowing that, by the changed axis of the earth, or any other\r\noperation of the globe, as a planetary body revolving in the solar\r\nsystem, great continents of land could have been erected from the place\r\nof their formation, the bottom of the sea, and placed in a higher\r\nelevation, compared with the surface of that water, yet such a continent\r\nas this could not have continued stationary for many thousand years; nor\r\ncould a continent of this kind have presented to us, every where within\r\nits body, masses of consolidated marble, and other mineral substances,\r\nin a state as different as possible from that in which they were, when\r\noriginally collected together in the sea.\r\n\r\nConsequently, besides an operation, by which the earth at the bottom of\r\nthe sea should be converted into an elevated land, or placed high above\r\nthe level of the ocean, there is required, in the operations of the\r\nglobe, a consolidating power, by which the loose materials that had\r\nsubsided from water, should be formed into masses of the most perfect\r\nsolidity, having neither water nor vacuity between their various\r\nconstituent parts, nor in the pores of those constituent parts\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nHere is an operation of the globe, whether chemical or mechanical, which\r\nis necessarily connected with the formation of our present continents:\r\nTherefore, had we a proper understanding of this secret operation, we\r\nmight thereby be enabled to form an opinion, with regard to the nature\r\nof that unknown power, by which the continents have been placed above\r\nthe surface of that water wherein they had their birth.\r\n\r\nIf this consolidating operation be performed at the bottom of the\r\nocean, or under great depths of the earth, of which our continents are\r\ncomposed, we cannot be witnesses to this mineral process, or acquire the\r\nknowledge of natural causes, by immediately observing the changes which\r\nthey produce; but though we have not this immediate observation of those\r\nchanges of bodies, we have, in science, the means of reasoning from\r\ndistant events; consequently, of discovering, in the general powers of\r\nnature, causes for those events of which we see the effects.\r\n\r\nThat the consolidating operation, in general, lies out of the reach of\r\nour immediate observation, will appear from the following truth: All the\r\nconsolidated masses, of which we now inquire into the cause, are, upon\r\nthe surface of the earth, in a state of general decay, although the\r\nvarious natures of those bodies admit of that dissolution in very\r\ndifferent degrees[4]\r\n\r\nFrom every view of the subject, therefore, we are directed to look into\r\nthose consolidated masses themselves, in order to find principles from\r\nwhence to judge of those operations by which they had attained their\r\nhardness or consolidated state.\r\n\r\nIt must be evident, that nothing but the most general acquaintance with\r\nthe laws of acting substances, and with those of bodies changing by the\r\npowers of nature, can enable us to set about this undertaking with any\r\nreasonable prospect of success; and here the science of Chemistry must\r\nbe brought particularly to our aid; for this science, having for its\r\nobject the changes produced upon the sensible qualities, as they are\r\ncalled, of bodies, by its means we may be enabled to judge of that which\r\nis possible according to the laws of nature, and of that which, in like\r\nmanner, we must consider as impossible.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Stalactical and certain ferruginous concretions may seem\r\nto form an exception to the generality of this proposition. But an\r\nobjection of this kind could only arise from a partial view of things;\r\nfor the concretion here is only temporary; it is in consequence of a\r\nsolution, and it is to be followed by a dissolution, which will be\r\ntreated of in its proper place.]\r\n\r\nWhatever conclusions, therefore, by means of this science, shall be\r\nattained, in just reasoning from natural appearances, this must be held\r\nas evidence, where more immediate proof cannot be obtained; and, in\r\na physical subject, where things actual are concerned, and not the\r\nimaginations of the human mind, this proof will be considered as\r\namounting to a demonstration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nAn Investigation of the Natural Operations employed in consolidating\r\nthe Strata of the Globe.\r\n\r\nWe are now about to investigate those mineral operations of the globe by\r\nwhich the qualities of hardness and solidity, consequently of strength\r\nand durability, are procured to great bodies of this earth.\r\n\r\nThat those qualities are not original to such bodies, but actually\r\nsuperinduced in the natural operations of the earth, will appear from\r\nthe examination of some of the hardest and most solid of those mineral\r\nbodies. In such masses, (for example of flint and agate,) we find\r\nincluded shells and coralline bodies. Consequently, there must be a\r\nnatural operation in the globe for consolidating and hardening its soft\r\nand loose materials. It is concerning the nature of this consolidating\r\noperation that we are now to inquire.\r\n\r\nThere are just two ways in which porous or spongy bodies can be\r\nconsolidated, and by which substances may be formed into masses of\r\na natural shape and regular structure; the one of these is simple\r\n_congelation_ from a fluid state, by means of cold; the other is\r\n_accretion_; and this includes a separatory operation, as well as that\r\nby which the solid body is to be produced. But in whichever of these\r\nways solidity shall be procured, it must be brought about by first\r\ninducing fluidity, either immediately by the action of heat, or\r\nmediately with the assistance of a solvent, that is, by the operation\r\nof solution. Therefore, fire and water may be considered as the general\r\nagents in this operation, which we would explore.\r\n\r\nHeat has been already mentioned as a general power, and as acting in all\r\nthe different parts of the globe; I would now wish more particularly to\r\ncall the attention of the reader to subterraneous fire, or heat, as\r\na powerful agent in the mineral regions, and as a cause necessarily\r\nbelonging to the internal constitution of this earth.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose at present to inquire into the particular nature\r\nof this power of subterraneous heat, or to trace the proper connection\r\nand analogy of the internal fire with that which is so necessary to our\r\nlife, and which acts so great a part upon the surface of the earth, this\r\nbeing reserved for the last part. Our intention in here mentioning it,\r\nis only to dispose the mind to look for active powers or efficient\r\ncauses, in that part of the earth which has been commonly considered as\r\npassive and inert, but which will be found extremely active, and the\r\nsource of mighty revolutions in the fate of land.\r\n\r\nThere may, indeed, be some difficulty in conceiving all the\r\nmodifications of this mineral power; but as, on the one hand, we are not\r\narbitrarily to assume an agent, for the purpose of explaining events, or\r\ncertain appearances which are not understood; so, on the other, we must\r\nnot refuse to admit the action of a known power, when this is properly\r\nsuggested in the appearances of things; and, though we may not\r\nunderstand all the modifications, or the whole capacity and regulation\r\nof this power in bodies, we are not to neglect the appropriating to it,\r\nas a cause, those effects which are natural to it, and which, so far as\r\nwe know, cannot belong to any other. On all occasions, we are to judge\r\nfrom what we know; and, we are only to avoid concluding from our\r\nsuppositions, in cases where evidence or real information is necessarily\r\nrequired. The subject now considered, subterraneous fire, will afford an\r\nexample of that truth; and, a general view of this great natural power\r\nwill here find a proper place, before the application of it for the\r\nexplanation of natural appearances.\r\n\r\nNo event is more the object of our notice, or more interesting as a\r\nsubject for our study, than is the burning of a fire: But, the more that\r\nphilosophers have studied this subject, the more they seem to differ\r\nas to the manner in which that conspicuous event is to be explained.\r\nTherefore, being so ignorant with regard to that fire of which we see\r\nthe origin as well as the more immediate effects, how cautious should\r\nwe be in judging the nature of subterraneous fire from the burning of\r\nbodies, a subject which we so little understand.\r\n\r\nBut, though the cause of fire in general, or the operations of that\r\npower in its extreme degrees, be for us a subject involved in much\r\nobscurity, this is not the case with regard to the more common effects\r\nof heat; and, tho' the actual existence of subterraneous fire, as the\r\ncause of light and heat, might be a thing altogether problematical in\r\nour opinion; yet, as to other effects, there are some of these from\r\nwhich the action of that liquefying power may be certainly concluded as\r\nhaving taken place within the mineral region, although the cause should\r\nbe in every other respect a thing to us unknown. In that case, where the\r\noperation or effect is evident, and cannot be disputed, to refuse to\r\nadmit the power in question, merely because we had not seen it act, or\r\nbecause we know not every rule which it may observe in acting, would\r\nbe only to found an argument upon our ignorance; it would be to\r\nmisunderstand the nature of investigating physical truths, which must\r\nproceed by reasoning from effect to cause.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge is extremely limited with regard to the effects of heat in\r\nbodies, while acting under different conditions, and in various degrees.\r\nBut though our knowledge in these respects is limited, our judgment with\r\nregard to the efficacy of this power of heat is in its nature positive,\r\nand contains not any thing that is doubtful or uncertain. All mankind,\r\nwho have the opportunity, know that the hard substance of ice is by heat\r\nconverted into water, wherein no hardness remains; and the profound\r\nphilosophy of Dr Black, in relation to the subject of _latent heat_, as\r\nthat of Sir Isaac Newton, in relation to the weight of bodies, is not\r\nnecessary to convince the world that in the one case ice will melt, and\r\nin the other, that heavy bodies will move when unsupported.\r\n\r\nBut though, in the abstract doctrine of _latent heat_, the ingenuity\r\nof man has discovered a certain measure for the quantity of those\r\ncommutable effects which are perceived; and though this be a progress of\r\nscience far above the apprehension of the vulgar, yet still, that solid\r\nbodies are changed into fluids, by the power of heat, is the same\r\nunalterable judgment, which the savage forms as well as the philosopher.\r\nHere, therefore, are evident effects, which mankind in general attribute\r\nto the power of heat; and it is from those known effects that we are to\r\ninvestigate subterraneous fire, or to generalise the power of heat, as\r\nacting in the interior parts, as well as on the surface of this earth.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, there were any other cause for fluidity besides the\r\noperation of fire or the power of heat, in that case the most evident\r\nproof, with regard to the flowing, or former fluidity, of mineral\r\nbodies, would draw to no conclusion in proving the existence of mineral\r\nfire; but when we have not the smallest reason for conjecturing any\r\nother cause, or the least doubt with regard to that which, in the\r\ndoctrine of latent heat, has been properly investigated, the proofs\r\nwhich we shall bring, of fusion in all the minerals of this earth,\r\nmust be held as proofs of mineral fire, in like manner as the proof of\r\nsubterraneous fire would necessarily imply mineral fusion as its natural\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThus we have, in our physical investigation, several points in view.\r\nFirst, from the present state of things, to infer a former state of\r\nfusion among mineral bodies. Secondly, from that former fusion, to infer\r\nthe actual existence of mineral fire in the system of the earth. And,\r\nlastly, from the acknowledged fact of subterraneous fire as a cause, to\r\nreason with regard to the effects of that power in mineral bodies.\r\n\r\nBut besides the power or effect of subterraneous heat in bodies which\r\nare unorganised, and without system, in the construction of their\r\ndifferent parts, we have to investigate the proper purpose of this great\r\nagent in the system of this world, which may be considered as a species\r\nof organised body. Here, therefore, final causes are to be brought into\r\nview, as well as those which are efficient. Now, in a subject involved\r\nwith so much obscurity, as must be for us the internal regions of the\r\nglobe, the consideration of efficient and final causes may contribute\r\nmutually to each others evidence, when separately the investigation of\r\neither might be thought unsatisfactory or insufficient.\r\n\r\nSo far it seemed necessary to premise with regard to the great mineral\r\npower which we are to employ as an agent in the system of this earth;\r\nand it may be now observed, that it is in the proper relation of this\r\npower of heat and the fluidity or softness of bodies, as cause and\r\neffect, that we are to find a physical principle or argument for\r\ndetecting those false theories of the earth that have been only\r\nimagined, and not properly founded on fact or observation. It is also by\r\nmeans of this principle, that we shall be enabled to form a true theory\r\nof the mineral region, in generalising particular effects to a common\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed in endeavouring to decide this important question,\r\nviz. By what active principle is it, that the present state of things,\r\nwhich we observe in the strata of the earth, a state so very different\r\nfrom that in which those bodies had been formed originally, has been\r\nbrought about?\r\n\r\nTwo causes have been now proposed for the consolidating of loose\r\nmaterials which had been in an incoherent state; these are, on the one\r\nhand, fire; or, on the other, water, as the means of bringing about that\r\nevent. We are, therefore, to consider well, what may be the consequences\r\nof consolidation by the one or other of those agents; and what may be\r\nthe respective powers of those agents with respect to this operation.\r\n\r\nIf we are not informed in this branch of science, we may gaze without\r\ninstruction upon the most convincing proofs of what we want to attain.\r\nIf our knowledge is imperfect, we may form erroneous principles, and\r\ndeceive ourselves in reasoning with regard to those works of nature,\r\nwhich are wisely calculated for our instruction.\r\n\r\nThe strata, formed at the bottom of the sea, are to be considered\r\nas having been consolidated, either by aqueous solution and\r\ncrystallization, or by the effect of heat and fusion. If it is in the\r\nfirst of these two ways that the solid strata of the globe have attained\r\nto their present state, there will be a certain uniformity observable\r\nin the effects; and there will be general laws, by which this operation\r\nmust have been conducted. Therefore, knowing those general laws, and\r\nmaking just observations with regard to the natural appearances of those\r\nconsolidated masses, a philosopher, in his closet, should be able to\r\ndetermine, what may, and what may not have been transacted in the bowels\r\nof the earth, or below the bottom of the ocean.\r\n\r\nLet us now endeavour to ascertain what may have been the power of water,\r\nacting under fixed circumstances, operating upon known substances, and\r\nconducting to a certain end.\r\n\r\nThe action of water upon all different substances is an operation\r\nwith which we are familiar. We have it in our power to apply water in\r\ndifferent degrees of heat for the solution of bodies, and under various\r\ndegrees of compression; consequently, there is no reason to conclude\r\nany thing mysterious in the operations of the globe, which are to be\r\nperformed by means of water, unless an immense compressing power should\r\nalter the nature of those operations. But compression alters the\r\nrelation of evaporation only with regard to heat, or it changes the\r\ndegree of heat which water may be made to sustain; consequently, we are\r\nto look for no occult quality in water acting upon bodies at the bottom\r\nof the deepest ocean, more than what can be observed in experiments\r\nwhich we have it in our power to try.\r\n\r\nWith regard again to the effect of time: Though the continuance of time\r\nmay do much in those operations which are extremely slow, where no\r\nchange, to our observation, had appeared to take place, yet, where it\r\nis not in the nature of things to produce the change in question, the\r\nunlimited course of time would be no more effectual, than the moment by\r\nwhich we measure events in our observations.\r\n\r\nWater being the general medium in which bodies collected at the bottom\r\nof the sea are always contained, if those masses of collected matter are\r\nto be consolidated by solution, it must be by the dissolution of\r\nthose bodies in that water as a menstruum, and by the concretion or\r\ncrystallization of this dissolved matter, that the spaces, first\r\noccupied by water in those masses, are afterwards to be filled with a\r\nhard and solid substance; but without some other power, by which the\r\nwater contained in those cavities and endless labyrinths of the strata,\r\nshould be separated in proportion as it had performed its task, it is\r\ninconceivable how those masses, however changed from the state of their\r\nfirst subsidence, should be absolutely consolidated, without any visible\r\nor fluid water in their composition.\r\n\r\nBesides this difficulty of having the water separated from the porous\r\nmasses which are to be consolidated, there is another with which, upon\r\nthis supposition, we have to struggle. This is, From whence should come\r\nthe matter with which the numberless cavities in those masses are to be\r\nfilled?\r\n\r\nThe water in the cavities and interstices of those bodies composing\r\nstrata, must be in a stagnating state; consequently, it can only act\r\nupon the surfaces of those cavities which are to be filled up. But\r\nwith what are they to be filled? Not with water; they are full of that\r\nalready: Not with the substance of the bodies which contain that water;\r\nthis would be only to make one cavity in order to fill up another.\r\nIf, therefore, the cavities of the strata are to be filled with solid\r\nmatter, by means of water, there must be made to pass through those\r\nporous masses, water impregnated with some other substances in a\r\ndissolved state; and the aqueous menstruum must be made to separate\r\nfrom the dissolved substance, and to deposit the same in those cavities\r\nthrough which the solution moves.\r\n\r\nBy such a supposition as this, we might perhaps explain a partial\r\nconsolidation of those strata; but this is a supposition, of which the\r\ncase under consideration does not admit; for in the present case, which\r\nis that of materials accumulated at the bottom of the ocean, there is\r\nnot proper means for separating the dissolved matter from the water\r\nincluded in those enormous masses; nor are there any means by which a\r\ncirculation in those masses may be formed. In this case, therefore,\r\nwhere the means are not naturally in the supposition, a philosopher, who\r\nis to explain the phenomenon by the natural operation of water in this\r\nsituation, must not have recourse to another agent, still more powerful,\r\nto assist his supposition which cannot be admitted.\r\n\r\nThus, it will appear, that, to consolidate strata formed at the bottom\r\nof the sea, in the manner now considered, operations are required\r\nunnatural to this place; consequently, not to be supposed, in order to\r\nsupport a hypothesis.\r\n\r\nBut now, instead of inquiring how far water may be supposed instrumental\r\nin the consolidation of strata which were originally of a loose\r\ntexture, we are to consider how far there may be appearances in those\r\nconsolidated bodies, by which it might be concluded, whether or not the\r\npresent state of their consolidation has been actually brought about by\r\nmeans of that agent.\r\n\r\nIf water had been the menstruum by which the consolidating matter was\r\nintroduced into the interstices of strata, masses of those bodies could\r\nonly be found consolidated with such substances as water is capable of\r\ndissolving; and these substances would be found only in such a state as\r\nthe simple separation of the solvent water might produce.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the consolidation of strata would be extremely limited;\r\nfor we cannot allow more power to water than we find it has in nature;\r\nnor are we to imagine to ourselves unlimited powers in bodies, on\r\npurpose to explain those appearances by which we should be made to know\r\nthe powers of nature. Let us, therefore, attend, with every possible\r\ncircumspection, to the appearances of those bodies, by means of which we\r\nare to investigate the principles of mineralogy, and know the laws of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe question now before us concerns the consolidating substances of\r\nstrata. Are these such as will correspond to the dissolving power of\r\nwater, and to the state in which these substances might be left by the\r\nseparation of their menstruum? No; far, far from this supposition is the\r\nconclusion that necessarily follows from natural appearances.\r\n\r\nWe have strata consolidated by calcareous spar, a thing perfectly\r\ndistinguishable from the stalactical concretion of calcareous earth,\r\nin consequence of aqueous solution. We have strata made solid by the\r\nformation of fluor, a substance not soluble, so far as we know, by\r\nwater. We have strata consolidated with sulphureous and bituminous\r\nsubstances, which do not correspond to the solution of water. We have\r\nstrata consolidated with siliceous matter, in a state different from\r\nthat under which it has been observed, on certain occasions, to be\r\ndeposited by water. We have strata consolidated by feld-spar, a\r\nsubstance insoluble in water. We have strata consolidated by almost all\r\nthe various metallic substances, with their almost endless mixtures\r\nand sulphureous compositions; that is to say, we find, perhaps, every\r\ndifferent substance introduced into the interstices of strata which had\r\nbeen formed by subsidence at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nIf it is by means of water that those interstices have been filled with\r\nthose materials, water must be, like fire, an universal solvent, or\r\ncause of fluidity, and we must change entirely our opinion of water in\r\nrelation to its chemical character. But there is no necessity thus to\r\nviolate our chemical principles, in order to explain certain natural\r\nappearances; more especially if those appearances may be explained in\r\nanother manner, consistently with the known laws of nature.\r\n\r\nIf, again, it is by means of heat and fusion that the loose and porous\r\nstructure of strata shall be supposed to have been consolidated, then\r\nevery difficulty which had occurred in reasoning upon the power or\r\nagency of water is at once removed. The loose and discontinuous body of\r\na stratum may be closed by means of softness and compression; the porous\r\nstructure of the materials may be consolidated, in a similar manner, by\r\nthe fusion of their substance; and foreign matter may be introduced into\r\nthe open structure of strata, in form of steam or exhalation, as well as\r\nin the fluid state of fusion; consequently, heat is an agent competent\r\nfor the consolidation of strata, which water alone is not. If,\r\ntherefore, such an agent could be found acting in the natural place of\r\nstrata, we must pronounce it proper to bring about that end.\r\n\r\nThe examination of nature gives countenance to this supposition, so far\r\nas strata are found consolidated by every species of substance,\r\nand almost every possible mixture of those different substances;\r\nconsequently, however difficult it may appear to have this application\r\nof heat, for the purpose of consolidating strata formed at the bottom of\r\nthe ocean, we cannot, from natural appearances, suppose any other cause,\r\nas having actually produced the effects which are now examined.\r\n\r\nThis question, with regard to the means of consolidating the strata of\r\nthe globe, is, to natural history, of the greatest importance; and it is\r\nessential in the theory now proposed to be given of the mineral system.\r\nIt would, therefore, require to be discussed with some degree of\r\nprecision in examining the particulars; but of these, there is so great\r\na field, and the subject is so complicated in its nature, that volumes\r\nmight be written upon particular branches only, without exhausting what\r\nmight be laid upon the subject; because the evidence, though strong in\r\nmany particulars, is chiefly to be enforced by a multitude of facts,\r\nconspiring, in a diversity of ways, to point out one truth, and by the\r\nimpossibility of reconciling all these facts, except by means of one\r\nsupposition.\r\n\r\nBut, as it is necessary to give some proof of that which is to be\r\na principle in our reasoning afterwards, I shall now endeavour to\r\ngeneralise the subject as much as possible, in order to answer that end,\r\nand, at the same time, to point out the particular method of inquiry.\r\n\r\nThere are to be found, among the various strata of the globe, bodies\r\nformed of two different kinds of substances, _siliceous_ bodies, and\r\nthose which may be termed _sulphureous_ or _phlogistic_. With one or\r\nother, or both of those we substances, every different consolidated\r\nstratum of the globe will be found so intimately mixed, or closely\r\nconnected, that it must be concluded, by whatever cause those bodies\r\nof siliceous and sulphureous matter had been changed from a fluid to a\r\nconcreted state, the strata must have been similarly affected by the\r\nsame cause.\r\n\r\nThese two species of bodies, therefore, the siliceous and the\r\nsulphureous, may now be examined, in relation to the causes of their\r\nconcretion, with a view to determine, what has been the general\r\nconcreting or consolidating power, which has operated universally in the\r\nglobe; and particularly to show, it has not been by means of any fluid\r\nsolution, that strata in general have been consolidated, or that those\r\nparticular substances have been crystallized and concreted.\r\n\r\nSiliceous matter, physically speaking, is not soluble in water; that is\r\nto say, in no manner of way have we been enabled to learn, that water\r\nhas the power of dissolving this matter.\r\n\r\nMany other substances, which are so little soluble in water, that their\r\nsolubility could not be otherwise detected of themselves, are made to\r\nappear soluble by means of siliceous matter; such is feld-spar, one of\r\nthe component parts of rock-granite.\r\n\r\nFeld-spar is a compound of siliceous, argillaceous, and calcareous\r\nearth, intimately united together. This compound siliceous body\r\nbeing, for ages, exposed to the weather, the calcareous part of it is\r\ndissolved, and the siliceous part is left in form of a soft white earth.\r\nBut whether this dissolution is performed by pure water, or by means\r\nalso of an acid, may perhaps be questioned. This, however, is certain,\r\nthat we must consider siliceous substances as insoluble in water.\r\n\r\nThe water of Glezer in Iceland undoubtedly contains this substance in\r\nsolution; but there is no reason to believe, that it is here dissolved\r\nby any other than the natural means; that is, an alkaline substance, by\r\nwhich siliceous bodies may be rendered soluble in water[5].\r\n\r\n[Note 5: This conjecture, which I had thus formed, has been fully\r\nconfirmed by the accurate analysis of those waters. See vol. 3d. of the\r\nPhil. Trans. of Edin.]\r\n\r\nIt may be, therefore, asserted, that no siliceous body having the\r\nhardness of flint, nor any crystallization of that substance, has ever\r\nbeen formed, except by fusion. If, by any art, this substance shall be\r\ndissolved in simple water, or made to crystallise from any solution, in\r\nthat case, the assertion which has been here made may be denied.\r\nBut where there is not the vestige of any proof, to authorise the\r\nsupposition of flinty matter being dissolved by water, or crystallized\r\nfrom that solution, such an hypothesis cannot be admitted, in opposition\r\nto general and evident appearances[6].\r\n\r\n[Note 6: The Chevalier de Dolomieu has imagined an ingenious theory for\r\nthe solution of siliceous substances in water [Journal de Physique, Mai\r\n1792.]. This theory has not been taken up merely at a venture, but\r\nis founded upon very accurate and interesting chemical experiments.\r\nHitherto, however, the nature of the siliceous substance is not\r\nsufficiently known, to enable us to found, upon chemical principles, the\r\nmineral operations of nature. That siliceous substance may be dissolved,\r\nor rendered soluble in water, by means of alkaline salt, and that it may\r\nbe also volatilised by means of the fluor acid, is almost all that we\r\nknow upon the subject. But this is saying no more in relation to the\r\nmineral operations employed upon the siliceous substance, than it would\r\nbe, in relation to those upon gold, to say that this metal is dissolved\r\nby aqua regia.\r\n\r\nIt is to be admitted, that every simple substance may have its\r\nmenstruum, by means of which it may be retained with water in a\r\ndissolved state; but from this it does not follow, that it is by the\r\nmeans of aqueous solutions of all those mineral bodies, that nature\r\noperates the consolidation of bodies, which we find actually\r\naccomplished with all those different substances. It is the business of\r\nthis work to show, that from all appearances in the mineral regions, as\r\nwell as those upon the surface in the atmosphere, the supposition, of\r\nthat manner of consolidating bodies by solution, is inconsistent both\r\nwith natural appearances, and also with chemical principles.\r\n\r\nOur ingenious author, who has, with, great diligence as well as an\r\nenlightened mind, observed the operations of nature upon the surface\r\nof the earth, here says, \"ce n'est pas sans étonnement que je remarque\r\ndepuis long-temps que jamais aucune eau qui coule à la surface de la\r\nterre n'attaque le quartz, aucune n'en tient en dissolution, pendant que\r\ncelles qui circulent intérieurement le corrodent aussi souvent qu'elles\r\nle déposent.\"--How dangerous it is in science for ingenious men to allow\r\nthemselves to form conclusions, which the principles on which they\r\nreason do not strictly warrant, we have a remarkable example in the\r\npresent case.\r\n\r\nM. de Dolomieu sees no corrosion of quartz, or solution of that\r\nsubstance, upon the surface of the earth; from this, then, he concludes,\r\nthat siliceous substance is not dissolved in that situation of things.\r\nOn the other hand, he finds siliceous bodies variously concreted among\r\nthe solid strata of the earth; and, from this he concludes, that\r\nsiliceous substance has been both dissolved by water in the strata, and\r\nalso there again concreted and crystallised in having been separated\r\nfrom the water. This is certainly what we all perceive; but we do not\r\nall allow ourselves to draw such inconclusive inferences from our\r\npremises. Notwithstanding the greatest accuracy of our observations,\r\nquartz may be dissolvable in a minute degree by water, upon the surface\r\nof this earth; and, all the appearances of siliceous bodies, in the\r\nmineral regions, where we cannot immediately see the operation, may be\r\nbetter explained by fusion than by aqueous solution.\r\n\r\nBut, from his chemical experiments, our author has conjectured that\r\nthere may be a phlogistic substance, by means of which the siliceous\r\nearth is dissolved when in darkness; and that this solvent loses its\r\npower, if exposed to the light of day. I have one observation to oppose\r\nto this ingenious theory. Under deep black mosses, through which no ray\r\nof light can penetrate, every condition for dissolving siliceous bodies\r\nshould be found, according to the supposition in question; neither will\r\nsufficient time be found wanting, in those deep mosses, upon the summits\r\nof our mountains; yet, examine the matter of fact? not the smallest\r\nsolution is to be perceived in the siliceous parts of the stones which\r\nare found under those mosses, but every particle of iron is dissolved,\r\nso that the surface of every stone is white, and nothing but the\r\nsiliceous earth of the feld-spar, and perhaps the argillaceous, is left.\r\n\r\nHere we have in this author an instructive example: No person, in my\r\nopinion, has made such enlightened or scientific experiments, or such\r\njudicious observations with regard to the nature of siliceous substance,\r\nas a compound thing; no person reasons more distinctly in general, or\r\nsees more clearly the importance of his principles; yet, with regard to\r\nmineral concretions, how often has he been drawn thus inadvertently\r\ninto improper generalization! I appeal to the analogy which, in this\r\ntreatise, he has formed, between the stalactical concretions upon\r\nthe surface of the earth, and the mineral concretions of siliceous\r\nsubstance. As an example of the great lights, and penetrating genius, of\r\nthis assiduous studier of nature, I refer to the judicious observations\r\nwhich he has made upon the subject of aluminous earth, in this\r\ndissertation.\r\n\r\nI am surprised to find this enlightened naturalist seeking, in the\r\norigin of this globe of our earth, a general principle of fluidity or\r\nsolution in water, like the alkahest of the alchymists, by means of\r\nwhich the different substances in the chemical constitution of precious\r\nstones might have been united as well as crystallised. One would\r\nhave thought, that a philosopher, so conversant in the operations of\r\nsubterraneous fire, would have perceived, that there is but one general\r\nprinciple of fluidity or dissolution, and that this is heat.]\r\n\r\nBesides this proof for the fusion of siliceous bodies, which is\r\nindirect, arising from the in dissolubility of that substance in water,\r\nthere is another, which is more direct, being founded upon appearances\r\nwhich are plainly inconsistent with any other supposition, except that\r\nof simple fluidity induced by heat. The proof I mean is, the penetration\r\nof many bodies with a flinty substance, which, according to every\r\ncollateral circumstance, must have been performed by the flinty matter\r\nin a simply fluid state, and not in a state of dissolution by a solvent.\r\n\r\nThese are flinty bodies perfectly insulated in strata both of chalk and\r\nsand. It requires but inspection to be convinced. It is not possible\r\nthat flinty matter could be conveyed into the middle of those strata, by\r\na menstruum in which it was dissolved, and thus deposited in that place,\r\nwithout the smallest trace of deposition in the surrounding parts.\r\n\r\nBut, besides this argument taken from what does not appear, the actual\r\nform in which those flinty masses are found, demonstrates, _first_,\r\nThat they have been introduced among those strata in a fluid state, by\r\ninjection from some other place. 2_dly_, That they have been dispersed\r\nin a variety of ways among those strata, then deeply immersed at the\r\nbottom of the sea; and, _lastly_, That they have been there congealed\r\nfrom the state of fusion, and have remained in that situation, while\r\nthose strata have been removed from the bottom of the ocean to the\r\nsurface of the present land.\r\n\r\nTo describe those particular appearances would draw this paper beyond\r\nthe bounds of an essay. We must, therefore, refer those who would\r\ninquire more minutely into the subject, to examine the chalk-countries\r\nof France and England, in which the flint is found variously formed; the\r\nland-hills interspersed among those chalk-countries, which have been\r\nalso injected by melted flint; and the pudding-stone of England, which\r\nI have not seen in its natural situation. More particularly, I would\r\nrecommend an examination of the insulated masses of stone, found in\r\nthe sand-hills by the city of Brussels; a stone which is formed by an\r\ninjection of flint among sand, similar to that which, in a body of\r\ngravel, had formed the pudding-stone of England[7].\r\n\r\n[Note 7: Accurate descriptions of those appearances, with drawings,\r\nwould be, to natural history, a valuable acquisition.]\r\n\r\nAll these examples would require to be examined upon the spot, as a\r\ngreat part of the proof for the fusion of the flinty substance, arises,\r\nin my opinion, from the form in which those bodies are found, and the\r\nstate of the surrounding parts. But there are specimens brought from\r\nmany different places, which contain, in themselves, the most evident\r\nmarks of this injection of the flinty substance in a fluid state. These\r\nare pieces of fossil wood, penetrated with a siliceous substance, which\r\nare brought from England, Germany, and Lochneagh in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt appears from these specimens, that there has sometimes been a prior\r\npenetration of the body of wood, either with irony matter, or calcareous\r\nsubstance. Sometimes, again, which is the case with that of Lochneagh,\r\nthere does not seem to have been any penetration of those two\r\nsubstances. The injected flint appears to have penetrated the body\r\nof this wood, immersed at the bottom of the sea, under an immense\r\ncompression of water. This appears from the wood being penetrated\r\npartially, some parts not being penetrated at all.\r\n\r\nNow, in the limits between those two parts, we have the most convincing\r\nproofs, that it had been flint in a simple fluid state which had\r\npenetrated the wood, and not in a state of solution.\r\n\r\n_First_, Because, however little of the wood is left unpenetrated, the\r\ndivision is always distinct between the injected part and that which is\r\nnot penetrated by the fluid flint. In this case, the flinty matter has\r\nproceeded a certain length, which is marked, and no farther; and, beyond\r\nthis boundary, there is no partial impregnation, nor a gradation of the\r\nflintifying operation, as must have been the case if siliceous matter\r\nhad been deposited from a solution. 2_dly_, The termination of the\r\nflinty impregnation has assumed such a form, precisely, as would\r\nnaturally happen from a fluid flint penetrating that body.\r\n\r\nIn other specimens of this mineralising operation, fossil wood,\r\npenetrated, more or less, with ferruginous and calcareous substances,\r\nhas been afterwards penetrated with a flinty substance. In this case,\r\nwith whatever different substances the woody body shall be supposed\r\nto have been penetrated in a state of solution by water, the regular\r\nstructure of the plant would still have remained, with its vacuities,\r\nvariously filled with the petrifying substances, separated from the\r\naqueous menstruum, and deposited in the vascular structure of the wood.\r\nThere cannot be a doubt with regard to the truth of this proposition;\r\nfor, as it is, we frequently find parts of the consolidated wood, with\r\nthe vascular structure remaining perfectly in its natural shape and\r\nsituation; but if it had been by aqueous solution that the wood had been\r\npenetrated and consolidated, all the parts of that body would be found\r\nin the same natural shape and situation.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is far from being the case; for while, in some parts, the\r\nvascular structure is preserved entire, it is also evident, that, in\r\ngeneral, the woody structure is variously broken and dissolved by the\r\nfusion and crystallization of the flint. There are so many and such\r\nvarious convincing examples of this, that, to attempt to describe them,\r\nwould be to exceed the bounds prescribed for this dissertation; but such\r\nspecimens are in my possession, ready for the inspection of any person\r\nwho may desire to study the subject.\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed to consider sulphureous substances, with regard to\r\ntheir solubility in water, and to the part which these bodies have acted\r\nin consolidating the strata of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe sulphureous substances here meant to be considered, are substances\r\nnot soluble in, water, so far as we know, but fusible by heat, and\r\ninflammable or combustible by means of heat and vital air. These\r\nsubstances are of two kinds; the one more simple, the other more\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\nThe most simple kind is composed of two different substances, viz.\r\nphlogiston, with certain specific substances; from which result, on the\r\none hand, sulphur, and, on the other, proper coal and metals. The more\r\ncompound sort, again, is oily matter, produced by vegetables, and\r\nforming bituminous bodies.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ of these is found naturally combined with almost all\r\nmetallic substances, which are then said to be mineralised with sulphur.\r\nNow, it is well known, that this mineralising operation is performed by\r\nmeans of heat or fusion; and there is no person skilled in chemistry\r\nthat will pretend to say, this may be done by aqueous solution. The\r\ncombination of iron and sulphur, for example, may easily be performed by\r\nfusion; but, by aqueous solution, this particular combination is again\r\nresolved, and forms an acido-metallic, that is, a vitriolic substance,\r\nafter the phlogiston (by means of which it is insoluble in water) has\r\nbeen separated from the composition, by the assistance of vital air.\r\n\r\nThe variety of these sulphureo-metallic substances, in point of\r\ncomposition, is almost indefinite; but, unless they were all soluble in\r\nwater, this could not have happened by the action of that solvent. If we\r\nshall allow any one of those bodies to have been formed by the fluidity\r\nof heat, they must all have been formed in the same manner; for there is\r\nsuch a chain of connection among those bodies in the mineral regions,\r\nthat they must all have been composed, either, on the one hand, by\r\naqueous solution, or, on the other, by means of heat and fusion.\r\n\r\nHere, for example, are crystallised together in one mass, 1_st,\r\nPyrites_, containing sulphur, iron, copper; 2_dly, Blend_, a composition\r\nof iron, sulphur, and calamine; 3_dly, Galena_, consisting of lead\r\nand sulphur; 4_thly, Marmor metallicum_, being the terra ponderosa,\r\nsaturated with the vitriolic acid; a substance insoluble in water;\r\n5_thly, Fluor_, a saturation of calcareous earth, with a peculiar acid,\r\ncalled the _acid of spar_, also insoluble in water; 6_thly, Calcareous\r\nspar_, of different kinds, being calcareous earth saturated with fixed\r\nair, and something besides, which forms a variety in this substance;\r\n_lastly, Siliceous substance_, or _Quartz crystals_. All these bodies,\r\neach possessing its proper shape, are mixed in such a manner as it would\r\nbe endless to describe, but which may be expressed in general by saying,\r\nthat they are mutually contained in, and contain each other.\r\n\r\nUnless, therefore; every one of these different substances may be\r\ndissolved in water, and crystallised from it, it is in vain to look for\r\nthe explanation of these appearances in the operations of nature, by the\r\nmeans of aqueous solution.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, heat being capable of rendering all these substances\r\nfluid, they may be, with the greatest simplicity, transported from one\r\nplace to another; and they may be made to concrete altogether at\r\nthe same time, and distinctly separate in any place. Hence, for the\r\nexplanation of those natural appearances, which are so general, no\r\nfurther conditions are required, than the supposition of a sufficient\r\nintensity of subterraneous fire or heat, and a sufficient degree of\r\ncompression upon those bodies, which are to be subjected to that violent\r\nheat, without calcination or change. But, so far as this supposition is\r\nnot gratuitous, the appearances of nature will be thus explained.\r\n\r\nI shall only mention one specimen, which must appear most decisive\r\nof the question. It is, I believe, from an Hungarian mine. In this\r\nspecimen, petro-silex, pyrites, and cinnabar, are so mixed together, and\r\ncrystallised upon each other, that it is impossible to conceive any one\r\nof those bodies to have had its fluidity and concretion from a cause\r\nwhich had not affected the other two. Now, let those who would deny the\r\nfusion of this siliceous body explain how water could dissolve these\r\nthree different bodies, and deposit them in their present shape. If,\r\non the contrary, they have not the least shadow of reason for such a\r\ngratuitous supposition, the present argument must be admitted in its\r\nfull force.\r\n\r\nSulphur and metals are commonly found combined in the mineral regions.\r\nBut this rule is not universal; for they are also frequently in a\r\nseparate state. There is not, perhaps, a metal, among the great number\r\nwhich are now discovered, that may not be found native, as they are\r\ncalled, or in their metallic state.\r\n\r\nMetallic substances are also thus found in some proportion to the\r\ndisposition of the particular metals, to resist the mineralising\r\noperations, and to their facility of being metallised by fire and\r\nfusion. Gold, which refuses to be mineralised with sulphur, is found\r\ngenerally in its native state. Iron, again, which is so easily\r\nmineralised and scorified, is seldom found in its malleable state. The\r\nother metals are all found more or less mineralised, though some of them\r\nbut rarely in the native state.\r\n\r\nBesides being found with circumstances thus corresponding to the natural\r\nfacility, or to the impediments attending the metallization of those\r\ndifferent calces, the native metals are also found in such a shape, and\r\nwith such marks, as can only agree with the fusion of those bodies;\r\nthat is to say, those appearances are perfectly irreconcilable with any\r\nmanner of solution and precipitation.\r\n\r\nFor the truth of this assertion, among a thousand other examples, I\r\nappeal to that famous mass of native iron discovered by Mr Pallas in\r\nSiberia. This mass being so well known to all the mineralists of Europe,\r\nany comment upon its shape and structure will be unnecessary[8].\r\n\r\n[Note 8: Since this Dissertation was written, M. de la Peyrouse has\r\ndiscovered a native manganese. The circumstances of this mineral are so\r\nwell adapted for illustrating the present doctrine, and so well related\r\nby M. de la Peyrouse, that I should be wanting to the interest of\r\nmineral knowledge, were I not to give here that part of his Memoir.\r\n\r\n\"Lorsque je fis insérer dans le journal de physique de l'année 1780, au\r\nmois de Janvier, une Dissertation contenant la classification des mines\r\nde manganèse, je ne connoissois point, à cette époque, la mine de\r\nmanganèse native. Elle a la couleur de son régule: Elle salit les doigts\r\nde la même teinte. Son tissu parait aussi lamelleux, et les lames\r\nsemblent affecter une sorte de divergence. Elle a ainsi que lui, l'éclat\r\nmétallique; comme lui elle se laisse aplatir sous le marteau, et\r\ns'exfolie si l'on redouble les coups; mais une circonstance qui est trop\r\nfrappante pour que je l'omette, c'est la figure de la manganèse native,\r\nsi prodigieusement conforme à celle du régule, qu'on s'y laisseroit\r\ntromper, si la mine n'étoit encore dans sa gangue: Figure\r\ntrès-essentielle à observer ici, parce qu'elle est due à la nature même\r\nde la manganèse. En effet, pour réduire toutes les mines en général, il\r\nfaut employer divers flux appropriés. Pour la réduction de la manganèse,\r\nbien loin d'user de ce moyen, il faut, au contraire, éloigner tout flux,\r\nproduire la fusion, par la seule violence et la promptitude du feu. Et\r\ntelle est la propension naturelle et prodigieuse de la manganèse à la\r\nvitrification, qu'on n'a pu parvenir encore à réduire son régule en un\r\nseul culot; on trouve dans le creuset plusieurs petits boutons, qui\r\nforment autant de culots séparés. Dans la mine de manganèse native, elle\r\nn'est point en une seule masse; elle est disposée également en plusieurs\r\nculots séparés, et un peu aplatis, comme ceux que l'art produit;\r\nbeaucoup plus gros, à la vérité, parce que les agens de la nature\r\ndoivent avoir une autre énergie, que ceux de nos laboratoires; et cette\r\nressemblance si exacte, semble devoir vous faire penser que la mine\r\nnative à été produite par le feu, tout comme son régule. La présence\r\nde la chaux argentée de la manganèse, me permettroit de croire que la\r\nnature n'a fait que réduire cette chaux. Du reste, cette mine native\r\nest très-pure, et ne contient aucune partie attirable à l'aimant. Cette\r\nmine, unique jusqu'à ce moment, vient, tout comme les autres manganèse\r\nque j'ai décrites, des mines de fer de _Sem_, dans la vallée de\r\n_Viedersos_, en Comté de Foix.\"--_Journal de Physique, Janvier 1786_.]\r\n\r\nWe come now to the _second_ species of inflammable bodies called oily or\r\nbituminous. These substances are also found variously mixed with mineral\r\nbodies, as well as forming strata of themselves; they are, therefore, a\r\nproper subject for a particular examination.\r\n\r\nIn the process of vegetation, there are produced oily and resinous\r\nsubstances; and, from the collection of these substances at the bottom\r\nof the ocean, there are formed strata, which have afterwards undergone\r\nvarious degrees of beat, and have been variously changed, in consequence\r\nof the effects of that heat, according as the distillation of the more\r\nvolatile parts of those bodies has been suffered to proceed.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand this, it must be considered, that, while immersed\r\nin water, and under insuperable compression, the vegetable, oily, and\r\nresinous substances, would appear to be unalterable by heat; and it is\r\nonly in proportion as certain chemical separations take place, that\r\nthese inflammable bodies are changed in their substance by the\r\napplication of heat. Now, the most general change of this kind is in\r\nconsequence of evaporation, or the distillation of their more volatile\r\nparts, by which oily substances become bituminous, and bituminous\r\nsubstances become coaly.\r\n\r\nThere is here a gradation which may be best understood, by comparing the\r\nextremes.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, we know by experiment, that oily and bituminous\r\nsubstances can be melted and partly changed into vapour by heat, and\r\nthat they become harder and denser, in proportion as the more volatile\r\nparts have evaporated from them. On the other hand, coaly substances are\r\ndestitute of fusibility and volatility, in proportion as they have\r\nbeen exposed to greater degrees of heat, and to other circumstances\r\nfavourable to the dissipation of their more volatile and fluid parts.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, in mineral bodies, we find the two extreme states of this\r\ncombustible substance, and also the intermediate states, we must either\r\nconclude, that this particular operation of heat has been thus actually\r\nemployed in nature, or we must explain those appearances by some other\r\nmeans, in as satisfactory a manner, and so as shall be consistent with\r\nother appearances.\r\n\r\nIn this case, it will avail nothing to have recourse to the false\r\nanalogy of water dissolving and crystallising salts, which has been so\r\nmuch employed for the explanation of other mineral appearances. The\r\noperation here in question is of a different nature, and necessarily\r\nrequires both the powers of heat and proper conditions for evaporation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to decide the point, with regard to what is the\r\npower in nature by which mineral bodies have become solid, we have\r\nbut to find bituminous substance in the most complete state of coal,\r\nintimately connected with some other substance, which is more generally\r\nfound consolidating the strata, and assisting in the concretion of\r\nmineral substances. But I have in my possession the most undoubted proof\r\nof this kind. It is a mineral vein, or cavity, in which are blended\r\ntogether coal of the most fixed kind, quartz and marmor metallicum. Nor\r\nis this all; for the specimen now referred to is contained in a rock\r\nof this kind, which every naturalist now-a-days will allow to have\r\ncongealed from a fluid state of fusion. I have also similar specimens\r\nfrom the same place, in which the coal is not of that fixed and\r\ninfusible kind which burns without flame or smoke, but is bituminous or\r\ninflammable coal.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto been resting the argument upon a single point, for the\r\nsake of simplicity or clearness, not for want of those circumstances\r\nwhich shall be found to corroborate the theory. The strata of fossil\r\ncoal are found in almost every intermediate state, as well as in those\r\nof bitumen and charcoal. Of the one kind is that fossil coal which melts\r\nor becomes fluid upon receiving heat; of the other, is that species of\r\ncoal, found both in Wales and Scotland, which is perfectly infusible in\r\nthe fire, and burns like coals, without flame or smoke. The one species\r\nabounds in oily matter, the other has been distilled by heat, until it\r\nhas become a _caput mortuum_, or perfect coal.\r\n\r\nThe more volatile parts of these bituminous bodies are found in their\r\nseparate state on some occasions. There is a stratum of limestone in\r\nFifeshire, near Raith, which, though but slightly tinged with a black\r\ncolour, contains bituminous matter, like pitch, in many cavities, which\r\nare lined with calcareous spar crystallised. I have a specimen of such\r\na cavity, in which the bitumen is in sphericles, or rounded drops,\r\nimmersed in the calcareous spar.\r\n\r\nNow, it is to be observed, that, if the cavity in the solid limestone or\r\nmarble, which is lined with calcareous crystals containing pyrites, had\r\nbeen thus encrusted by means of the filtration of water, this water must\r\nhave dissolved calcareous spar, pyrites, and bitumen. But these natural\r\nappearances would not even be explained by this dissolution and supposed\r\nfiltration of those substances. There is also required, _first_, A\r\ncause for the separation of those different substances from the aqueous\r\nmenstruum in which they had been dissolved; _2dly_, An explanation of\r\nthe way in which a dissolved bitumen should be formed into round hard\r\nbodies of the most solid structure; and, _lastly_, Some probable means\r\nfor this complicated operation being performed, below the bottom of the\r\nocean, in the close cavity of a marble stratum.\r\n\r\nThus, the additional proof, from the facts relating to the bituminous\r\nsubstances, conspiring with that from the phenomena of other bodies,\r\naffords the strongest corroboration of this opinion, that the various\r\nconcretions found in the internal parts of strata have not been\r\noccasioned by means of aqueous solution, but by the power of heat and\r\noperation of simple fusion, preparing those different substances to\r\nconcrete and crystallise in cooling.\r\n\r\nThe arguments which have been now employed for proving that strata have\r\nbeen consolidated by the power of heat, or by the means of fusion, have\r\nbeen drawn chiefly from the insoluble nature of those consolidating\r\nsubstances in relation to water, which is the only general menstruum\r\nthat can be allowed for the mineral regions. But there are found, in\r\nthe mineral kingdom, many solid masses of saltgem, which is a soluble\r\nsubstance. It may be now inquired, How far these masses, which are not\r\ninfrequent in the earth, tend either to confirm the present theory, or,\r\non the contrary, to give countenance to that which supposes water the\r\nchief instrument in consolidating strata.\r\n\r\nThe formation of salt at the bottom of the sea, without the assistance\r\nof subterranean fire, is not a thing unsupposable, as at first sight\r\nit might appear. Let us but suppose a rock placed across the gut\r\nof Gibraltar, (a case nowise unnatural), and the bottom of the\r\nMediterranean would be certainly filled with salt, because the\r\nevaporation from the surface of that sea exceeds the measure of its\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nBut strata of salt, formed in this manner at the bottom of the sea, are\r\nas far from being consolidated by means of aqueous solution, as a bed of\r\nsand in the same situation; and we cannot explain the consolidation of\r\nsuch a stratum of salt by means of water, without supposing subterranean\r\nheat employed, to evaporate the brine which would successively occupy\r\nthe interstices of the saline crystals. But this, it may be observed, is\r\nequally departing from the natural operation of water, as the means for\r\nconsolidating the sediment of the ocean, as if we were to suppose\r\nthe same thing done by heat and fusion. For the question is not,\r\nIf subterranean heat be of sufficient intensity for the purpose of\r\nconsolidating strata by the fusion of their substances; the question is,\r\nWhether it be by means of this agent, subterranean heat, or by water\r\nalone, without the operation of a melting heat, that those materials\r\nhave been variously consolidated.\r\n\r\nThe example now under consideration, consolidated mineral salt, will\r\nserve to throw some light upon the subject; for, as it is to be shown,\r\nthat this body of salt had been consolidated by perfect fusion, and\r\nnot by means of aqueous solution, the consolidation of strata of\r\nindissoluble substances, by the operation of a melting heat, will meet\r\nwith all that confirmation which the consistency of natural appearances\r\ncan give.\r\n\r\nThe salt rock in Cheshire lies in strata of red marl. It is horizontal\r\nin its direction. I do not know its thickness, but it is dug thirty or\r\nforty feet deep. The body of this rock is perfectly solid, and the salt,\r\nin many places, pure, colourless, and transparent, breaking with a\r\nsparry cubical structure. But the greatest part is tinged by the\r\nadmixture of the marl, and that in various degrees, from the slightest\r\ntinge of red, to the most perfect opacity. Thus, the rock appears as if\r\nit had been a mass of fluid salt, in which had been floating a quantity\r\nof marly substance, not uniformly mixed, but every where separating and\r\nsubsiding from the pure saline substance.\r\n\r\nThere is also to be observed a certain regularity in this separation of\r\nthe tinging from the colourless substance, which, at a proper distance,\r\ngives to the perpendicular section of the rock a distinguishable figure\r\nin its structure. When looking at this appearance near the bottom of\r\nthe rock, it, at first, presented me with the figure of regular\r\nstratification; but, upon examining the whole mass of rock, I found,\r\nthat it was only towards the bottom that this stratified appearance took\r\nplace; and that, at the top of the rock, the most beautiful and regular\r\nfigure was to be observed; but a figure the most opposite to that of\r\nstratification. It was all composed of concentric circles; and these\r\nappeared to be the section of a mass, composed altogether of concentric\r\nspheres, like those beautiful systems of configuration which agates so\r\nfrequently present us with in miniature. In about eight or ten feet from\r\nthe top, the circles growing large, were blended together, and gradually\r\nlost their regular appearance, until, at a greater depth, they again\r\nappeared in resemblance of a stratification.\r\n\r\nThis regular arrangement of the floating marly substance in the body\r\nof salt, which is that of the structure of a coated pebble, or that\r\nof concentric spheres, is altogether inexplicable upon any other\r\nsupposition, than the perfect fluidity or fusion of the salt, and the\r\nattractions and repulsions of the contained substances. It is in vain\r\nto look, in the operations of solution and evaporation, for that which\r\nnothing but perfect fluidity or fusion can explain.\r\n\r\nThis example of a mineral salt congealed from a melted state, may be\r\nconfirmed from another which I have from Dr Black, who suggested it to\r\nme. It is an alkaline salt, found in a mineral state, and described in\r\nthe Philosophical Transactions, _anno_ 1771. But to understand this\r\nspecimen, something must be premised with regard to the nature of fossil\r\nalkali.\r\n\r\nThe fossil alkali crystallises from a dissolved state, in combining\r\nitself with a large portion of the water, in the manner of alum; and,\r\nin this case, the water is essential to the constitution of that\r\ntransparent crystalline body; for, upon the evaporation of the water,\r\nthe transparent salt loses its solidity, and becomes a white powder. If,\r\ninstead of being gently dried, the crystalline salt is suddenly exposed\r\nto a sufficient degree of heat, that is, somewhat more than boiling\r\nwater, it enters into the state of aqueous fusion, and it boils, in\r\nemitting the water by means of which it had been crystallised in the\r\ncold, and rendered fluid in that heated state. It is not possible to\r\ncrystallise this alkaline salt from a dissolved state, without the\r\ncombination of that quantity of water, nor to separate that water\r\nwithout destroying its crystalline state.\r\n\r\nBut in this mineral specimen, we have a solid crystalline salt, with\r\na structure which, upon fracture, appears to be sparry and radiated,\r\nsomething resembling that of zeolite. It contains no water in its\r\ncrystallization, but melts in a sufficient heat, without any aqueous\r\nfusion. Therefore, this salt must have been in a fluid state of fusion,\r\nimmediately before its congelation and crystallization.\r\n\r\nIt would be endless to give examples of particular facts, so many are\r\nthe different natural appearances that occur, attended with a variety of\r\ndifferent circumstances.\r\n\r\nThere is one, however, which is peculiarly distinct, admits of\r\nsufficiently accurate description, and contains circumstances from which\r\nconclusions may be drawn with clearness. This is the ironstone, which\r\nis commonly found among the argillaceous strata, attendant upon fossil\r\ncoal, both in Scotland and in England.\r\n\r\nThis stone is generally found among the bituminous schistus, or black\r\nargillaceous strata, either in separate masses of various shapes and\r\nsizes, or forming of itself strata which are more or less continuous in\r\ntheir direction among the schistous or argillaceous beds.\r\n\r\nThis mineral contains, in general, from 40 to 50 _per cent._ of iron,\r\nand it loses near one third of its weight in calcination. Before\r\ncalcination it is of a grey colour, is not penetrable by water, and\r\ntakes a polish. In this state, therefore, it is perfectly solid; but\r\nbeing calcined, it becomes red, porous, and tender.\r\n\r\nThe fact to be proved with regard to these iron-stones is this, That\r\nthey have acquired their solid state from fusion, and not in concreting\r\nfrom any aqueous solution.\r\n\r\nTo abridge this disquisition, no argument is to be taken from contingent\r\ncircumstances, (which, however, are often found here as well as in the\r\ncase of marbles); such only are to be employed as are general to the\r\nsubject, and arise necessarily from the nature of the operation.\r\n\r\nIt will be proper to describe a species of these stones, which is\r\nremarkably regular in its form. It is that found at Aberlady, in East\r\nLothian.\r\n\r\nThe form of these iron-stones is that of an oblate or much compressed\r\nsphere, and the size from two or three inches diameter to more than\r\na foot. In the circular or horizontal section, they present the most\r\nelegant septarium[9]; and, from the examination of this particular\r\nstructure, the following conclusions may be drawn.\r\n\r\n_First_, That, the septa have been formed by the uniform contraction\r\nof the internal parts of the stone, the volume of the central parts\r\ndiminishing more than that of the circumference; by this means, the\r\nseparations of the stone diminish, in a progression from the center\r\ntowards the circumference.\r\n\r\n_2d_, That there are only two ways in which the septa must have received\r\nthe spar or spatthose ore with which they are filled, more or less,\r\neither, _first_ By insinuation into the cavity of the septa after these\r\nwere formed; or, _2dly_, By separation from the substance of the stone,\r\nat the same time that the septa were forming.\r\n\r\n[Note 9: Plate I.]\r\n\r\nWere the first supposition true, appearances would be observable,\r\nshowing that the sparry substance had been admitted, either through the\r\nporous structure of the stone, or through proper apertures communicating\r\nfrom without. Now, if either one or other of these had been the case,\r\nand that the stone had been consolidated from no other cause than\r\nconcretion from a dissolved state, that particular structure of the\r\nstone, by means of which the spar had been admitted, must appear at\r\npresent upon an accurate examination.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not the case, and we may rest the argument here. The\r\nsepta reach not the circumference; the surface of the stone is solid and\r\nuniform in every part; and there is not any appearance of the spar in\r\nthe argillaceous bed around the stone.\r\n\r\nIt, therefore, necessarily follows, that the contraction of the\r\niron-stone, in order to form septa, and the filling of these cavities\r\nwith spar, had proceeded _pari passu_; and that this operation must have\r\nbeen brought about by means of fusion, or by congelation from a state of\r\nsimple fluidity and expansion.\r\n\r\nIt is only further to be observed, that all the arguments which have\r\nbeen already employed, concerning mineral concretions from a simply\r\nfluid state, or that of fusion, here take place. I have septaria of this\r\nkind, in which, besides pyrites, iron-ore, calcareous spar, and another\r\nthat is ferruginous and compound, there is contained siliceous\r\ncrystals; a case which is not so common. I have them also attended with\r\ncircumstances of concretion and crystallization, which, besides being\r\nextremely rare, are equally curious and interesting.\r\n\r\nThere is one fact more which is well worth our attention, being one\r\nof those which are so general in the mineral regions. It is the\r\ncrystallizations which are found in close cavities of the most solid\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nNothing is more common than this appearance. Cavities are every where\r\nfound closely lined with crystallizations, of every different substance\r\nwhich may be supposed in those places. These concretions are well known\r\nto naturalists, and form part of the beautiful specimens which\r\nare preserved in the cabinets of collectors, and which the German\r\nmineralists have termed _Drusen_. I shall only particularise one\r\nspecies, which may be described upon principle, and therefore may be\r\na proper subject on which to reason, for ascertaining the order of\r\nproduction in certain bodies. This body, which we are now to examine, is\r\nof the agate species.\r\n\r\nWe have now been considering the means employed by nature in\r\nconsolidating strata which were originally of an open structure; but in\r\nperfectly solid strata we find bodies of agate, which have evidently\r\nbeen formed in that place where they now are found. This fact, however,\r\nis not still that of which we are now particularly to inquire; for this,\r\nof which we are to treat, concerns only a cavity within this agate; now,\r\nwhatever may have been the origin of the agate itself, we are to show,\r\nfrom what appears within its cavity, that the crystallizations which are\r\nfound in this place had arisen from a simply fluid state, and not from\r\nthat of any manner of solution.\r\n\r\nThe agates now in question are those of the coated kind, so frequent in\r\nthis country, called pebbles. Many of these are filled with a siliceous\r\ncrystallization, which evidently proceeds from the circumference\r\ntowards the centre. Many of them, again, are hollow. Those cavities are\r\nvariously lined with crystallized substances; and these are the object\r\nof the present examination.\r\n\r\nBut before describing what is found within, it is necessary to attend to\r\nthis particular circumstance, that the cavity is perfectly inclosed with\r\nmany solid coats, impervious to air or water, but particularly with\r\nthe external cortical part, which is extremely hard, takes the highest\r\npolish, and is of the most perfect solidity, admitting the passage of\r\nnothing but light and heat.\r\n\r\nWithin these cavities, we find, _1st_, The coat of crystals with which\r\nthis cavity is always lined; and this is general to all substances\r\nconcreting, in similar circumstances, from a state of fusion; for when\r\nthus at liberty they naturally crystallise. _2dly_, We have frequently\r\na subsequent crystallization, resting on the first, and more or less\r\nimmersed in it. _3dly_, There is also sometimes a third crystallization,\r\nsuperincumbent on the second, in like manner as the second was on the\r\nfirst. I shall mention some particulars.\r\n\r\nI have one specimen, in which the primary crystals are siliceous, the\r\nsecondary thin foliaceous crystals of deep red but transparent iron-ore,\r\nforming elegant figures, that have the form of roses. The tertiary\r\ncrystallization is a frosting of small siliceous crystals upon the edges\r\nof the foliaceous crystals.\r\n\r\nIn other specimens, there is first a lining of colourless siliceous\r\ncrystals, then another lining of amethystine crystals, and sometimes\r\nwithin that, fuliginous crystals. Upon these fuliginous and amethystine\r\ncrystals are many sphericles or hemispheres of red compact iron-ore,\r\nlike haematites.\r\n\r\nIn others, again, the primary crystals are siliceous, and the secondary\r\ncalcareous. Of this kind, I have one which has, upon the calcareous\r\ncrystals, beautiful transparent siliceous crystals, and iron sphericles\r\nboth upon all these crystals, and within them.\r\n\r\n_Lastly_, I have an agate formed of various red and white coats, and\r\nbeautifully figured. The cavity within the coated part of the pebble is\r\nfilled up without vacuity, first, with colourless siliceous crystals;\r\nsecondly, with fuliginous crystals; and, lastly, with white or\r\ncolourless calcareous spar. But between the spar and crystals there are\r\nmany sphericles, seemingly of iron, half sunk into each of these two\r\ndifferent substances.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, I may now be allowed to draw the following\r\nconclusions:\r\n\r\n1_st_, That concretion had proceeded from the surface of the agate body\r\ninwards. This necessarily follows from the nature of those figured\r\nbodies, the figures of the external coats always determining the shape\r\nof those within, and never, contrarily, those within affecting those\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n2_dly_, That when the agate was formed, the cavity then contained every\r\nthing which now is found within it, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n3_dly_, That the contained substances must have been in a fluid state,\r\nin order to their crystallizing.\r\n\r\n_Lastly_, That as this fluid state had not been the effect of solution\r\nin a menstruum, it must have been fluidity from heat and fusion.\r\n\r\nLet us now make one general observation and argument with regard to\r\nthe formation of those various coated, concreted, crystallized, and\r\nconfigured bodies. Were the crystallization and configuration found\r\nto proceed from a central body, and to be directed from that centre\r\noutwards, then, without inquiring into collateral appearances, and other\r\nproofs with regard to the natural concretion of those substances, we\r\nmight suppose that these concretions might have proceeded from that\r\ncentral body gradually by accretion, and that the concreting and\r\ncrystallizing substances might have been supplied from a fluid which had\r\nbefore retained the concreting substance in solution; in like manner as\r\nthe crystallizations of sugar, which are formed in the solution of\r\nthat saccharine substance, and are termed candies, are formed upon the\r\nthreads which are extended in the crystallizing vessel for that purpose.\r\nBut if, on the contrary, we are to consider those mineral bodies as\r\nspheres of alternate coats, composed of agate, crystal, spars, etc.; and\r\nif all those crystallizations have their _bases_ upon the uncrystallized\r\ncoat which is immediately external to it, and their _apices_ turned\r\ninwards into the next internal solid coat, it is not possible to\r\nconceive that a structure of this kind could have been formed in\r\nany manner from a solution. But this last manner is the way without\r\nexception in which those mineral bodies are found; therefore we are to\r\nconclude, that the concretion of those bodies had proceeded immediately\r\nfrom a state of fusion or simple fluidity.\r\n\r\nIn granite these cavities are commonly lined with the crystal\r\ncorresponding to the constituent substances of the stone, viz. quartz,\r\nfeld-spar, and mica or talk. M. de Saussure, (Voyages dans les Alpes,\r\ntom. ii. §722.), says, \"On trouve fréquemment des amas considérables de\r\nspath calcaire, crystallisé dans les grottes ou se forme le crystal de\r\nroche; quoique ces grottes soient renfermées dans le coeur des montagnes\r\nd'un granit vif, & qu'on ne voie aucun roc calcaire au dessus de ces\r\nmontagnes.\"\r\n\r\nSo accurate an observer, and so complete a naturalist, must have\r\nobserved how the extraneous substance had been introduced into this\r\ncavity, had they not been formed together the cavity and the calcareous\r\ncrystals. That M. de Saussure perceived no means for that introduction,\r\nwill appear from what immediately follows in that paragraph. \"Ces rocs\r\nauroient-ils été détruits, ou bien ce spath n'est il que le produit\r\nd'une sécrétion des parties calcaires que l'on fait êtres dispersées\r\nentre les divers élémens du granit?\"\r\n\r\nHad M. de Saussure allowed himself to suppose all those substances in\r\nfusion, of which there cannot be a doubt, he would soon have resolved\r\nboth this difficulty, and also that of finding molybdena crystallized\r\nalong with feld-spar, in a cavity of this kind. §718.\r\n\r\nTo this argument, taken from the close cavities in our agates, I am now\r\nto add another demonstration. It is the case of the calcedony agate,\r\ncontaining a body of calcareous spar; here it is to be shown, that,\r\nwhile the calcareous body was altogether inclosed within the calcedony\r\nnodular body, these two substances had been perfectly soft, and had\r\nmutually affected each others shape, in concreting from a fluid state.\r\nIn order to see this, we are to consider that both those substances have\r\nspecific shapes in which they concrete from the third state; the\r\nsparry structure of the one is well known; the spherical or mammelated\r\ncrystallization of the calcedony, is no less conspicuous; this last\r\nis, in the present case, spherical figures, which are some of\r\nthem hemispheres, or even more. The figures which we have now in\r\ncontemplation are so distinctly different as cannot be mistaken; the\r\none is a rhombic figure bounded by planes; the other is a most perfect\r\nspherical form; and both these are specific figures, belonging\r\nrespectively to the crystallization of those two substances.\r\n\r\nThe argument now to be employed for proving that those two bodies had\r\nconcreted from the fluid state of fusion, and not from any manner of\r\nsolution, is this: That, were the one of those bodies to be found\r\nimpressing the other with its specific figure, we must conclude that the\r\nimpressing body had concreted or crystallized while the impressed body\r\nwas in a soft or fluid state; and that, if they are both found mutually\r\nimpressing and impressed by each other, they must have both been in\r\nthe fluid and concreting state together. Now the fact is, that the\r\ncalcareous body is perfectly inclosed within the solid calcedony, and\r\nthat they are mutually impressed by each others specific figure, the\r\nsparry structure of the calcareous body impressing the calcedony with\r\nits type of planes and angles, at the same time that, in other parts,\r\nthe spherical figures of the calcedony enter the solid body of the\r\nspar, and thus impress their mammelated figures into that part which is\r\ncontiguous. It is therefore inconceivable, that these appearances\r\ncould have been produced in any other manner than by those two bodies\r\nconcreting from a simply fluid state.\r\n\r\nThere are in jaspers and agates many other appearances, from whence the\r\nfusion of those substances may be concluded with great certainty and\r\nprecision; but it is hoped, that what has been now given may suffice for\r\nestablishing that proposition without any doubt.\r\n\r\nIt must not be here objected, That there are frequently found siliceous\r\ncrystals and amethysts containing water; and that it is impossible\r\nto confine water even in melted glass. It is true, that here, at the\r\nsurface of the earth, melted glass cannot, in ordinary circumstances, be\r\nmade to receive and inclose condensed water; but let us only suppose a\r\nsufficient degree of compression in the body of melted glass, and we\r\ncan easily imagine it to receive and confine water as well as any\r\nother substance. But if, even in our operations, water, by means of\r\ncompression, may be made to endure the heat of red hot iron without\r\nbeing converted into vapour, what may not the power of nature be able to\r\nperform? The place of mineral operations is not on the surface of the\r\nearth; and we are not to limit nature with our imbecility, or estimate\r\nthe powers of nature by the measure of our own.[10]\r\n\r\n[Note 10: This is so material a principle in the theory of consolidating\r\nthe strata of the earth by the fusion of mineral substances, that I beg\r\nthe particular attention of the reader to that subject. The effect of\r\ncompression upon compound substances, submitted to increased degrees of\r\nheat, is not a matter of supposition, it is an established principle\r\nin natural philosophy. This, like every other physical principle, is\r\nfounded upon matter of fact or experience; we find, that many compound\r\nsubstances may with heat be easily changed, by having their more\r\nvolatile parts separated when under a small compression; but these\r\nsubstances are preserved without change when sufficiently compressed.\r\nOur experiments of this kind are necessarily extremely limited; they\r\nare not, however, for that reason, the less conclusive. The effects of\r\nincreasing degrees of heat are certainly prevented by increasing degrees\r\nof compression; but the rate at which the different effects of those\r\npowers proceed, or the measure of those different degrees of increase\r\nthat may be made without changing the constitution of the compound\r\nsubstance, are not known; nor is there any limit to be set to that\r\noperation, so far as we know. Consequently, it is a physical principle,\r\nThat the evaporation of volatile substances by heat, or the reparation\r\nof them from a compound substance, consequently the effect of fire in\r\nchanging that compound substance, may be absolutely prevented by means\r\nof compression.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to be considered, how far there is reason to conclude\r\nthat there had been sufficient degrees of compression in the mineral\r\nregions, for the purpose of melting the various substances with which we\r\nfind strata consolidated, without changing the chemical constitution of\r\nthose compound substances.\r\n\r\nHad I, in reasoning _a priori_, asserted, That all mineral bodies might\r\nhave been melted without change, when under sufficient compression,\r\nthere might have arisen, in the minds of reasoning men, some doubt with\r\nregard to the certainty of that proposition, however probable it were to\r\nbe esteemed: But when, in reasoning _a posteriori_, it is found that all\r\nmineral bodies have been actually melted, then, all that is required to\r\nestablish the proposition on which I have founded my theory, is to\r\nsee that there must have been immense degrees of compression upon the\r\nsubjects in question; for we neither know the degree of heat which had\r\nbeen employed, nor that of compression by which the effect of the heat\r\nmust have been modified.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to see that there had been immense compression, we have\r\nbut to consider that the formation of the strata, which are to be\r\nconsolidated, was at the bottom of the ocean, and that this place is to\r\nus unfathomable. If it be farther necessary to show that it had been at\r\nsuch unfathomable depth strata were consolidated, it will be sufficient\r\nto observe, it is not upon the surface of the earth, or above the level\r\nof the sea, that this mineral operation can take place; for, it is there\r\nthat those consolidated bodies are redissolved, or necessarily going\r\ninto decay, which is the opposite to that operation which we are now\r\ninquiring after; therefore, if they were consolidated in any other place\r\nthan at the bottom of the sea, it must have been between that place of\r\ntheir formation and the surface of the sea; but that is a supposition\r\nwhich we have not any reason to make; therefore, we must conclude that\r\nit was at the bottom of the ocean those stratified bodies had been\r\nconsolidated.]\r\n\r\nTo conclude this long chemico-mineral disquisition, I have specimens in\r\nwhich the mixture of calcareous, siliceous, and metallic substances,\r\nin almost every species of concretion which is to be found in mineral\r\nbodies, may be observed, and in which there is exhibited, in miniature,\r\nalmost every species of mineral transaction, which, in nature, is found\r\nupon a scale of grandeur and magnificence. They are nodules contained in\r\nthe whin-stone, porphyry, or basaltes of the Calton-hill, by Edinburgh;\r\na body which is to be afterwards examined, when it will be found to have\r\nflowed, and to have been in fusion, by the operation of subterraneous\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nThis evidence, though most conclusive with regard to the application of\r\nsubterraneous heat, as the means employed in bringing into fusion all\r\nthe different substances with which strata may be found consolidated, is\r\nnot directly a proof that strata had been consolidated by the fusion of\r\ntheir proper substance. It was necessary to see the general nature of\r\nthe evidence, for the universal application of subterraneous heat, in\r\nthe fusion of every kind of mineral body. Now, that this has been done,\r\nwe may give examples of strata consolidated without the introduction\r\nof foreign matter, merely by the softening or fusion of their own\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, we may consider two different species of strata,\r\nsuch as are perfectly simple in their nature, of the most distinct\r\nsubstances, and whose origin is perfectly understood, consequently,\r\nwhose subsequent changes may be reasoned upon with certainty and\r\nclearness. These are the siliceous and calcareous strata; and these\r\nare the two prevailing substances of the globe, all the rest being, in\r\ncomparison of these, as nothing; for unless it be the bituminous or coal\r\nstrata, there is hardly any other which does not necessarily contain\r\nmore or less of one or other of these two substances. If, therefore,\r\nit can be shown, that both of those two general strata have been\r\nconsolidated by the simple fusion of their substance, no _desideratum_\r\nor doubt will remain, with regard to the nature of that operation which\r\nhas been transacted at great depths of the earth, places to which all\r\naccess is denied to mortal eyes.\r\n\r\nWe are now to prove, _first_, That those strata have been consolidated\r\nby simple fusion; and, _2dly_, That this operation is universal, in\r\nrelation to the strata of the earth, as having produced the various\r\ndegrees of solidity or hardness in these bodies.\r\n\r\nI shall first remark, that a fortuitous collection of hard bodies, such\r\nas gravel and sand, can only touch in points, and cannot, while in that\r\nhard state, be made to correspond so precisely to each others shape as\r\nto consolidate the mass. But if these hard bodies should be softened in\r\ntheir substance, or brought into a certain degree of fusion, they\r\nmight be adapted mutually to each other, and thus consolidate the open\r\nstructure of the mass. Therefore, to prove the present point, we have\r\nbut to exhibit specimens of siliceous and calcareous strata which have\r\nbeen evidently consolidated in this manner.\r\n\r\nOf the first kind, great varieties occur in this country. It is,\r\ntherefore, needless to describe these particularly. They are the\r\nconsolidated strata of gravel and sand, often containing abundance of\r\nfeld-spar, and thus graduating into granite; a body, in this respect,\r\nperfectly similar to the more regular strata which we now examine.\r\n\r\nThe second kind, again, are not so common in this country, unless\r\nwe consider the shells and coralline bodies in our lime-stones, as\r\nexhibiting the same example, which indeed they do. But I have a specimen\r\nof marble from Spain, which may be described, and which will afford the\r\nmost satisfactory evidence of the fact in question.\r\n\r\nThis Spanish marble may be considered as a species of pudding-stone,\r\nbeing formed of calcareous gravel; a species of marble which, from Mr\r\nBowles' Natural History, appears to be very common in Spain. The gravel\r\nof which this marble is composed, consists of fragments of other marbles\r\nof different kinds. Among these, are different species of _oolites_\r\nmarble, some shell marbles, and some composed of a chalky substance, or\r\nof undistinguishable parts. But it appears, that all these different\r\nmarbles had been consolidated or made hard, then broken into fragments,\r\nrolled and worn by attrition, and thus collected together, along with\r\nsome sand or small siliceous bodies, into one mass. Lastly, This\r\ncompound body is consolidated in such a manner as to give the most\r\ndistinct evidence, that this had been executed by the operation of heat\r\nor simple fusion.\r\n\r\nThe proof I give is this, That besides the general conformation of those\r\nhard bodies, so as to be perfectly adapted to each other's shape, there\r\nis, in some places, a mutual indentation of the different pieces of\r\ngravel into each other; an indentation which resembles perfectly that\r\njunction of the different bones of the _cranium_, called sutures, and\r\nwhich must have necessarily required a mixture of those bodies while in\r\na soft or fluid state.\r\n\r\nThis appearance of indentation is by no means singular, or limited to\r\none particular specimen. I have several specimens of different marbles,\r\nin which fine examples of this species of mixture may be perceived. But\r\nin this particular case of the Spanish pudding-stone, where the mutual\r\nindentation is made between two pieces of hard stone, worn round by\r\nattrition, the softening or fusion of these two bodies is not simply\r\nrendered probable, but demonstrated.\r\n\r\nHaving thus proved, that those strata had been consolidated by simple\r\nfusion, as proposed, we now proceed to show, that this mineral operation\r\nhad been not only general, as being found in all the regions of the\r\nglobe, but universal, in consolidating our earth in all the various\r\ndegrees, from loose and incoherent shells and sand, to the most solid\r\nbodies of the siliceous and calcareous substances.\r\n\r\nTo exemplify this in the various collections and mixtures of sands,\r\ngravels, shells, and corals, were endless and superfluous. I shall only\r\ntake, for an example, one simple homogeneous body, in order to exhibit\r\nit in the various degrees of consolidation, from the state of simple\r\nincoherent earth to that of the most solid marble. It must be evident\r\nthat this is chalk; naturally a soft calcareous earth, but which may be\r\nalso found consolidated in every different degree.\r\n\r\nThrough the middle of the Isle of Wight, there runs a ridge of hills of\r\nindurated chalk. This ridge runs from the Isle of Wight directly west\r\ninto Dorsetshire, and goes by Corscastle towards Dorchester, perhaps\r\nbeyond that place. The sea has broke through this ridge at the west\r\nend of the Isle of Wight, where columns of the indurated chalk remain,\r\ncalled the Needles; the same appearance being found upon the opposite\r\nshore in Dorsetshire.\r\n\r\nIn this field of chalk, we find every gradation of that soft earthy\r\nsubstance to the most consolidated body of this indurated ridge, which\r\nis not solid marble, but which has lost its chalky property, and has\r\nacquired a kind of stony hardness.\r\n\r\nWe want only further to see this cretaceous substance in its most\r\nindurated and consolidated state; and this we have in the north of\r\nIreland, not far from the Giants Causeway. I have examined cargoes of\r\nthis lime-stone brought to the west of Scotland, and find the most\r\nperfect evidence of this body having been once a mass of chalk, which is\r\nnow a solid marble.\r\n\r\nThus, if it is by means of fusion that the strata of the earth have\r\nbeen, in many places, consolidated, we must conclude, that all the\r\ndegrees of consolidation, which are indefinite, have been brought about\r\nby the same means.\r\n\r\nNow, that all the strata of the mineral regions, which are those only\r\nnow examined, have been consolidated in some degree, is a fact for which\r\nno proof can be offered here, but must be submitted to experience and\r\ninquiry; so far, however, as they shall be considered as consolidated in\r\nany degree, which they certainly are in general, we have investigated\r\nthe means which had been employed in that mineral operation.\r\n\r\nWe have now considered the concretions of particular bodies, and the\r\ngeneral consolidation of strata; but it may be alleged, that there is\r\na great part of the solid mass of this earth not properly comprehended\r\namong those bodies which have been thus proved to be consolidated by\r\nmeans of fusion. The body here alluded to is granite; a mass which is\r\nnot generally stratified, and which, being a body perfectly solid,\r\nand forming some part in the structure of this earth, deserves to be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThe nature of granite, as a part of the structure of the earth, is too\r\nintricate a subject to be here considered, where we only seek to prove\r\nthe fusion of a substance from the evident marks which are to be\r\nobserved in a body. We shall, therefore, only now consider one\r\nparticular species of granite; and if this shall appear to have been in\r\na fluid state of fusion, we may be allowed to extend this property to\r\nall the kind.\r\n\r\nThe species now to be examined comes from the north country, about four\r\nor five miles west from Portfoy, on the road to Huntly. I have not been\r\nupon the spot, but am informed that this rock is immediately connected\r\nor continuous with the common granite of the country. This indeed\r\nappears in the specimens which I have got; for, in some of these, there\r\nis to be perceived a gradation from the regular to the irregular sort.\r\n\r\nThis rock may indeed be considered, in some respects, as a porphyry; for\r\nit has an evident ground, which is feld-spar, in its sparry state;\r\nand it is, in one view, distinctly maculated with quartz, which is\r\ntransparent, but somewhat dark-coloured[11].\r\n\r\n[Note 11: Plate II. fig. 1. 2. 3.]\r\n\r\nConsidered as a porphyry, this specimen is no less singular than as a\r\ngranite. For, instead of a siliceous ground, maculated with the rhombic\r\nfeld-spar, which is the common state of porphyry, the ground is\r\nuniformly crystallised, or a homogeneous regular feld-spar, maculated\r\nwith the transparent siliceous substance. But as, besides the feld-spar\r\nand quartz, which are the constituent parts of the stone, there is also\r\nmica, in some places, it may, with propriety, be termed a granite.\r\n\r\nThe singularity of this specimen consists, not in the nature or\r\nproportions of its constituent parts, but in the uniformity of the\r\nsparry ground, and the regular shape of the quartz mixture. This\r\nsiliceous substance, viewed in one direction, or longitudinally, may\r\nbe considered as columnar, prismatical, or continued in lines running\r\nnearly parallel. These columnar bodies of quartz are beautifully\r\nimpressed with a figure on the sides, where they are in contact with the\r\nspar. This figure is that of furrows or channels, which are perfectly\r\nparallel, and run across the longitudinal direction of the quartz. This\r\nis represented in fig. 4. This striated figure is only seen when, by\r\nfracture, the quartz is separated from the contiguous spar.\r\n\r\nBut what I would here more particularly represent is, the transverse\r\nsection of those longitudinal siliceous bodies These are seen in fig. 1.\r\n2. and 3. They have not only separately the forms of certain typographic\r\ncharacters, but collectively give the regular lineal appearance of types\r\nset in writing.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the inspection of this fossil, that the sparry and\r\nsiliceous substances had been mixed together in a fluid state; and that\r\nthe crystallization of the sparry substance, which is rhombic, had\r\ndetermined the regular structure of the quartz, at least in some\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThus, the siliceous substance is to be considered as included in the\r\nspar, and as figured, according to the laws of crystallization proper\r\nto the sparry ground; but the spar is also to be found included in the\r\nquartz. It is not, indeed, always perfectly included or inclosed on all\r\nsides; but this is sometimes the case, or it appears so in the section.\r\nFig. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. and 10. are those cases magnified, and represent the\r\ndifferent figured quartz inclosing the feld-spar. In one of them, the\r\nfeld-spar, which is contained within the quartz, contains also a small\r\ntriangle of quartz, which it incloses. Now, it is not possible to\r\nconceive any other way in which those two substances, quartz and\r\nfeld-spar, could be thus concreted, except by congelation from a fluid\r\nstate, in which they had been mixed.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing more to be observed with regard to this curious\r\nspecies of granite. It is the different order or arrangement of the\r\ncrystallization or internal structure of the feld-spar ground, in two\r\ncontiguous parts of the same mass. This is to be perceived in the\r\npolished surface of the stone, by means of the reflection of light.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain direction in which, viewing the stone, when the light\r\nfalls with a proper obliquity, we see a luminous reflection from the\r\ninternal parts of the stone. This arises from the reflecting surfaces\r\nof the sparry structure or minute cracks, all turned in one direction,\r\nconsequently, giving that luminous appearance only in one point of view.\r\n\r\nNow, all the parts of the stone in which the figured quartz is directed\r\nin the same manner, or regularly placed in relation to each other,\r\npresent that shining appearance to the eye at one time, or in the same\r\npoint of direction. But there are parts of the mass, which, though\r\nimmediately contiguous and properly continuous, have a different\r\ndisposition of the figured quartz; and these two distinguished masses,\r\nin the same surface of the polished stone, give to the eye their shining\r\nappearance in very different directions. Fig. 3. shows two of those\r\nfigured and shining masses, in the same plane or polished surface.\r\n\r\nIt must be evident, that, as the crystallization of the sparry structure\r\nis the figuring cause of the quartz bodies, there must be observed a\r\ncertain correspondency between those two things, the alinement (if I may\r\nbe allowed the expression) of the quartz, and the shining of the sparry\r\nground. It must also appear, that at the time of congelation of the\r\nfluid spar, those two contiguous portions had been differently disposed\r\nin the crystallization of their substance. This is an observation which\r\nI have had frequent opportunities of making, with respect to masses of\r\ncalcareous spar.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, therefore, whether we shall consider granite as a\r\nstratum or as an irregular mass, whether as a collection of several\r\nmaterials, or as the separation of substances which had been mixed,\r\nthere is sufficient evidence of this body having been consolidated by\r\nmeans of fusion, and in no other manner.\r\n\r\nWe are thus led to suppose, that the power of heat and operation\r\nof fusion must have been employed in consolidating strata of loose\r\nmaterials, which had been collected together and amassed at the bottom\r\nof the ocean. It will, therefore, be proper to consider, what are the\r\nappearances in consolidated strata that naturally should follow, on the\r\none hand, from fluidity having been, in this manner, introduced by means\r\nof heat, and, on the other, from the interstices being filled by means\r\nof solution; that so we may compare appearances with the one and other\r\nof those two suppositions, in order to know that with which they may be\r\nonly found consistent.\r\n\r\nThe consolidation of strata with every different kind of substance was\r\nfound to be inconsistent with the supposition, that aqueous solution\r\nhad been the means employed for this purpose. This appearance, on the\r\ncontrary, is perfectly consistent with the idea, that the fluidity of\r\nthese bodies had been the effect of heat; for, whether we suppose the\r\nintroduction of foreign matter into the porous mass of a stratum for its\r\nconsolidation, or whether we shall suppose the materials of the mass\r\nacquiring a degree of softness, by means of which, together with an\r\nimmense compression, the porous body might be rendered solid; the power\r\nof heat, as the cause of fluidity and vapour, is equally proper and\r\nperfectly competent. Here, therefore, appearances are as decidedly in\r\nfavour of the last supposition, as they had been inconsistent with the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nBut if strata have been consolidated by means of aqueous solution, these\r\nmasses should be found precisely in the same state as when they were\r\noriginally deposited from the water. The perpendicular section of those\r\nmasses might show the compression of the bodies included in them, or of\r\nwhich they are composed; but the horizontal section could not contain\r\nany separation of the parts of the stratum from one another.\r\n\r\nIf, again, strata have been consolidated by means of heat, acting in\r\nsuch a manner as to soften their substance, then, in cooling, they must\r\nhave formed rents or separations of their substance, by the unequal\r\ndegrees of contraction which the contiguous strata may have suffered.\r\nHere is a most decisive mark by which the present question must be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThere is not in nature any appearance more distinct than this of the\r\nperpendicular fissures and separations in strata. These are generally\r\nknown to workmen by the terms of veins or backs and cutters; and there\r\nis no consolidated stratum that wants these appearances. Here is,\r\ntherefore, a clear decision of the question, Whether it has been by\r\nmeans of heat, or by means of aqueous solution, that collections of\r\nloose bodies at the bottom of the sea have been consolidated into the\r\nhardest rocks and most perfect marbles[12].\r\n\r\n[Note 12: This subject is extremely interesting, both to the theory of\r\nthe earth, and to the science cf the mining art; I will now illustrate\r\nthat theory, with an authority which I received after giving this\r\ndissertation to the Royal Society. It is in the second volume of M. de\r\nSaussure's _voyages dans les Alpes_. Here I find proper examples for\r\nillustrating that subject of mineralogy; and I am happy to have this\r\nopportunity of giving the reasoning of a man of science upon the\r\nsubject, and the opinion of a person who is in every respect so well\r\nqualified to judge upon a point of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe first example is of a marble in the Alps, (_voyages dans les\r\nAlpes._) tom. 2. page 271.\r\n\r\n\"La pâte de ces brèches est tantôt blanche, tantôt grise, et les\r\nfragmens qui y font renfermés font, les uns blancs, les autres gris,\r\nd'autres roux, et presque toujours d'une couleur différente de celle de\r\nla pâte qui les lit. Ils sont tous de nature calcaire; tels étaient au\r\nmoins tous ceux que j'ai pus observer; et ce qu'il-y-a de remarquable,\r\nc'est qu'ils sont tous posés dans le sens des feuillets de la pierre; on\r\ndiroit en les voyant, qu'ils ont tous été comprimés et écrasés dans\r\nle même sens. Cette même pierre est mêlée de mica, sur-tout dans les\r\ninterstices des couches et entre les fragmens et la pâte qui les réunit;\r\nmais on ne voit point de mica dans les fragmens eux-mêmes. On trouve\r\naussi dans ces brèches des infiltrations de quartz. Cette pierre est\r\ncoupée par des fréquentes fissures perpendiculaires aux plans des\r\ncouches. On voit clairement que ces fentes out été formées par l'inégal\r\naffaissement des couches, et non par une retraite spontanée: car les\r\nmorceaux ou fragmens étrangers sont tous partagés et coupés net par ces\r\nfissures au lieu que dans les divisions naturelles des couches, ces\r\nmêmes fragmens sont entiers et saillans au dehors de la surface. Les\r\nnoeuds de quartz et les divers crystaux, que renferment les roches\r\nfeuilletées, présentent le même phénomène, et l'on peut en tirer la même\r\nconséquence; ils font partagés dans les fentes, et entiers dans les\r\nséparations des couches.\"\r\n\r\nHe finds those particular strata in the other side of the mountain _col\r\nde la Seigne_, and gives us the following observations:\r\n\r\n\"Plus bas on passe entre deux bancs de ces mêmes brèches, entre lesquels\r\nsont interposées des couches d'ardoises noires et de grès feuilletés\r\nmicacés, dont la situation est la même.\r\n\r\n\"On retrouve encore ces brèches vers le has de la descente, au pied de\r\npyramides calcaires dont j'ai parlé plus haut. Je trouvai en 1774 de\r\ntrès-jolis crystaux de roche qui s'étaient formés dans les fentes de\r\ncette brèche. Il y avoit même un mélange de quartz et de mica qui\r\ns'étoit moulé dans quelques-une de ces fentes. C'étoit donc une roche\r\nsemblable aux primitives, et pourtant d'une formation postérieure à\r\ncelle de la pierre calcaire. Et quel système pourroit nous persuader que\r\nla nature ne puisse encore produire ce qu'elle a produit autrefois!\"\r\n\r\nM. de Saussure has here given us an example of a calcareous Braccia,\r\nas he calls it, but which is rather a pudding stone, with veins or\r\ncontractions of the mass. He does not seem to understand these as\r\nconsequences of the consolidation of those strata; this, however, is\r\nthe only light in which these appearances may be explained, when those\r\nbodies are thus divided without any other separation in the mass.\r\n\r\nThe second example is found in the vertical strata of those mountains\r\nthrough which the Rhône has made its way in running from the great\r\nvalley of the _Vallais_ towards the lake of Geneva. (Chapitre xlviii.)\r\n\r\n\"C'est une espèce de pétrosilex gris, dur, sonore, un peu transparent,\r\nqui se débite en feuillets minces parfaitement plans et réguliers. Ces\r\nfeuillets, ou plutôt ces couches, courent à 35 degrés du nord par est,\r\nen montant du coté de l'ouest sous un angle de 80 degrés. Ces couches\r\nsont coupées par des fentes qui leur sont à-peu-près perpendiculaires et\r\nqui le sont aussi à l'horizon. Cette pierre s'emploie aux mêmes usage\r\nque l'ardoise, mais elle est beaucoup plus forte et plus durable, parce\r\nqu'elle est plus dure et moins accessible aux impressions de l'eau et de\r\nl'air.\r\n\r\n§ 1047. \"Ces pétrosilex feuilletés changent peu-à-peu de nature, en\r\nadmettant dans les interstices de leurs feuillets des parties de\r\nfeldspath. Ils out alors l'apparence d'une roche feuilletée, quartzeuse\r\net micacée, (_quartzum fornacum W._). Mais cette apparence est\r\ntrompeuse; car on n'y trouve pas un atome de quartz: toutes les parties\r\nblanches qui donnent du feu contre l'acier, font du feldspath; et les\r\nparties grise écailleuses ne font point du mica, ce sont de lames minces\r\ndu pétrosilex dont j'ai déjà parlé.\"\r\n\r\nHere is evidently what I would call petuntze strata, or porcelane stone,\r\nthat is, strata formed by the deposits of such materials as might come\r\nfrom the _detritus_ of granite, arranged at the bottom of the sea, and\r\nconsolidated by heat in the mineral regions. We have precisely such\r\nstratified masses in the Pentland hills near Edinburgh. I have also a\r\nspecimen of the same kind, brought from the East Indies, in which there\r\nis the print of an organized body. I believe it to be of some coralline\r\nor zoophite.\r\n\r\n§ 1048. \"Cette roche mélangée continue jusqu'à ce que le rocher\r\ns'éloigne un peu du grand chemin. Là, ce rocher se présente coupé à\r\npic dans une grande étendue, et divisé par de grandes fentes obliques,\r\nà-peu-près parallèles entr'elles. Ces fentes partagent la montagne en\r\ngrandes tranches de 50 à 60 pieds d'épaisseur, que de loin semblent être\r\ndes couches. Mais lorsqu'on s'en approche, on voit, par le tissu même\r\nde la pierre feuilletée, que ses vraies couches font avec l'horizon des\r\nangles de 70 à 75 degré, et que ces grandes divisions sont de vraies\r\nfentes par lesquelles un grand nombre de couches consécutives sont\r\ncoupées presque perpendiculairement à leurs plans. Les masses de rocher,\r\ncomprises entre ces grandes fentes, sont encore divisées par d'autres\r\nfentes plus petites, dont la plupart sont paralleles aux grandes,\r\nd'autres leur sont obliques; mais toutes sont à très-peu-près\r\nperpendiculaires aux plans des couchés dont la montagne est composée.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a distinct view of that which may be found to take place in all\r\nconsolidated strata, whatever be the composition of the stratum; and\r\nit is this appearance which is here maintained to be a physical\r\ndemonstration, that those strata had been consolidated by means of\r\nheat softening their materials. In that case, those stratified\r\nbodies, contracting in cooling, form veins and fissures traversing\r\nperpendicularly their planes; and these veins are afterwards filled with\r\nmineral substances. These are what I have here distinguished as the\r\n_particular_ veins of mineral masses; things perfectly different from\r\nproper mineral or metallic veins, which are more general, as belonging\r\nto immense masses of those strata; and which had been formed, not from\r\nthe contraction, but from the disrupture of those masses, and by the\r\nforcible injection of fluid mineral substances from below. Now these two\r\nspecies of veins, the particular and the general, although occasionally\r\nconnected, must be in science carefully distinguished; in the one, we\r\nsee the means which had been employed for the consolidation of the\r\nstrata; in the other, we see that power by which the strata have been\r\nraised from the bottom of the sea and placed in the atmosphere.]\r\n\r\nError never can be consistent, nor can truth fail of having support from\r\nthe accurate examination of every circumstance. It is not enough to\r\nhave found appearances decisive of the question, with regard to the\r\ntwo suppositions which have been now considered, we may farther seek\r\nconfirmation of that supposition which has been found alone consistent\r\nwith appearances.\r\n\r\nIf it be by means of heat and fusion that strata have been consolidated,\r\nthen, in proportion to the degree of consolidation they have undergone\r\nfrom their original state, they should, _caeteris paribus_, abound more\r\nwith separations in their mass. But this conclusion is found consistent\r\nwith appearances. A stratum of porous sand-stone does not abound so much\r\nwith veins and cutters as a similar stratum of marble, or even a\r\nsimilar stratum of sand-stone that is more consolidated. In proportion,\r\ntherefore, as strata have been consolidated, they are in general\r\nintersected with veins and cutters; and in proportion as strata are\r\ndeep in their perpendicular section, the veins are wide, and placed at\r\ngreater distances. In like manner, when strata are thin, the veins are\r\nmany, but proportionally narrow.\r\n\r\nIt is thus, upon chemical principles, to be demonstrated, That all the\r\nsolid strata of the globe have been condensed by means of heat, and\r\nhardened from a state of fusion. But this proposition is equally to\r\nbe maintained from principles which are mechanical. The strata of the\r\nglobe, besides being formed of earths, are composed of sand, of gravel,\r\nand fragments of hard bodies, all which may be considered as, in their\r\nnature, simple; but these strata are also found composed of bodies which\r\nare not simple, but are fragments of former strata, which had been\r\nconsolidated, and afterwards were broken and worn by attrition, so as\r\nto be made gravel. Strata composed in this manner have been again\r\nconsolidated; and now the question is, By what means?\r\n\r\nIf strata composed of such various bodies had been consolidated, by any\r\nmanner of concretion, from the fluidity of a dissolution, the hard and\r\nsolid bodies must be found in their entire state, while the interstices\r\nbetween those constituent parts of the stratum are filled up. No partial\r\nfracture can be conceived as introduced into the middle of a solid mass\r\nof hard matter, without having been communicated from the surrounding\r\nparts. But such partial separations are found in the middle of those\r\nhard and solid masses; therefore, this compound body must have been\r\nconsolidated by other means than that of concretion from a state of a\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish marble already described, as well as many consolidated\r\nstrata of siliceous gravel, of which I have specimens, afford the\r\nclearest evidence of this fact. These hard bodies are perfectly united\r\ntogether, in forming the most solid mass; the contiguous parts of some\r\nof the rounded fragments are interlaced together, as has already been\r\nobserved; and there are partial shrinkings of the mass forming veins,\r\ntraversing several fragments, but perfectly filled with the sparry\r\nsubstance of the mass, and sometimes with parts of the stone distinctly\r\nfloating in the transparent body of spar. Now, there is not, besides\r\nheat or fusion, any known power in nature by which these effects might\r\nbe produced. But such effects are general to all consolidated masses,\r\nalthough not always so well illustrated in a cabinet specimen.\r\n\r\nThus we have discovered a truth that is confirmed by every appearance,\r\nso far as the nature of the subject now examined admits. We now return\r\nto the general operation, of forming continents of those materials which\r\nhad been deposited at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nInvestigation of the Natural Operations employed in the Production of\r\nLand above the Surface of the Sea.\r\n\r\nWe seek to know that operation by means of which masses of loose\r\nmaterials, collected at the bottom of the sea, were raised above its\r\nsurface, and transformed into solid land.\r\n\r\nWe have found, that there is not in this globe (as a planet revolving\r\nin the solar system) any power or motion adapted to the purpose now in\r\nview; nor, were there such a power, could a mass of simply collected\r\nmaterials have continued any considerable time to resist the waves and\r\ncurrents natural to the sea, but must have been quickly carried away,\r\nand again deposited at the bottom of the ocean. But we have found, that\r\nthere had been operations, natural to the bowels of this earth; by which\r\nthose loose and unconnected materials have been cemented together, and\r\nconsolidated into masses of great strength and hardness; those bodies\r\nare thus enabled to resist the force of waves and currents, and to\r\npreserve themselves, for a sufficient time, in their proper shape and\r\nplace, as land above the general surface of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWe now desire to know, how far those internal operations of the globe,\r\nby which solidity and stability are procured to the beds of loose\r\nmaterials, may have been also employed in raising up a continent of\r\nland, to remain above the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so proper for the erection of land above the level of\r\nthe ocean, as an expansive power of sufficient force, applied directly\r\nunder materials in the bottom of the sea, under a mass that is proper\r\nfor the formation of land when thus erected. The question is not, how\r\nsuch a power may be procured; such a power has probably been employed.\r\nIf, therefore, such a power should be consistent with that which we\r\nfound had actually been employed in preparing the erected mass; or,\r\nif such a power is to be reasonably concluded as accompanying those\r\noperations which we have found natural to the globe, and situated in the\r\nvery place where this expansive power appears to be required, we should\r\nthus be led to perceive, in the natural operations of the globe, a power\r\nas efficacious for the elevation of what had been at the bottom of the\r\nsea into the place of land, as it is perfect for the preparation of\r\nthose materials to serve the purpose of their elevation.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to this conclusion, it will not be allowed to allege; that\r\nwe are ignorant how such a power might be exerted under the bottom of\r\nthe ocean; for, the present question is not, what had been the cause of\r\nheat, which has appeared to have been produced in that place, but if\r\nthis power of heat, which has certainly been exerted at the bottom of\r\nthe ocean for consolidating strata, had been employed also for another\r\npurpose, that is, for raising those strata into the place of land.\r\n\r\nWe may, perhaps, account for the elevation of land, by the same cause\r\nwith that of the consolidation of strata, already investigated, without\r\nexplaining the means employed by nature in procuring the power of heat,\r\nor showing from what general source of action this particular power had\r\nbeen derived; but, by finding in subterranean heat a cause for any other\r\nchange, besides the consolidation of porous or incoherent bodies, we\r\nshall generalise a fact, or extend our knowledge in the explanation of\r\nnatural appearances.\r\n\r\nThe power of heat for the expansion of bodies, is, so far as we know,\r\nunlimited; but, by the expansion of bodies placed under the strata at\r\nthe bottom of the sea, the elevation of those strata may be effected;\r\nand the question now to be resolved regards the actual exertion of\r\nthis power of expansion. How far it is to be concluded as having been\r\nemployed in the production of this earth above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to resolve that question, it may be proper to observe,\r\nthere has been exerted an extreme degree of heat below the strata formed\r\nat the bottom of the sea; and this is precisely the action of a power\r\nrequired for the elevation of those heated bodies into a higher place.\r\nTherefore, if there is no other way in which we may conceive this event\r\nto have been brought about, consistent with the present state of things,\r\nor what actually appears, we shall have a right to conclude, that such\r\nhad been the order of procedure in natural things, and that the\r\nstrata formed at the bottom of the sea had been elevated, as well as\r\nconsolidated, by means of subterraneous heat.\r\n\r\nThe consolidation of strata by means of fusion or the power of heat, has\r\nbeen concluded from the examination of nature, and from finding, that\r\nthe present state of things is inconsistent with any other supposition.\r\nNow, again, we are considering the only power that may be conceived as\r\ncapable of elevating strata from the bottom of the sea, and placing such\r\na mass above the surface of the water. It is a truth unquestionable,\r\nthat what had been originally at the bottom of the sea, is at present\r\nthe highest of our land. In explaining this appearance, therefore, no\r\nother alternative is left, but either to suppose strata elevated by the\r\npower of heat above the level of the present sea, or the surface of the\r\nocean reduced many miles below the height at which it had subsisted\r\nduring the collection and induration of the land which we inhabit.\r\n\r\nNow, if, on the one hand, we are to suppose no general power of\r\nsubterraneous fire or heat, we leave to our theory no means for the\r\nretreat of the sea, or the lowering of its surface; if, on the other\r\nhand, we are to allow the general power of subterraneous heat, we cannot\r\nhave much difficulty in supposing, either the surface of the sea to have\r\nsubsided, or the bottom of the ocean, in certain parts, to have been\r\nraised by a subterranean power above the level of its surface, according\r\nas appearances shall be found to require the one or other of those\r\nconclusions. Here, therefore, we are again remitted to the history of\r\nnature, in order to find matter of fact by which this question may be\r\nproperly decided.\r\n\r\nIf the present land had been discovered by the subsiding of the waters,\r\nthere has not been a former land, from whence materials had been\r\nprocured for the construction of the present, when at the bottom of the\r\nsea; for, there is no vestige remaining of that land, the whole land of\r\nthe present earth having been formed evidently at the bottom of the sea.\r\nNeither could the natural productions of the sea have been accumulated,\r\nin the shape in which we now find them, on the surface of this earth;\r\nfor, How should the Alps and Andes have been formed within the sea\r\nfrom the natural productions of the water? Consequently, this is a\r\nsupposition inconsistent with every natural appearance.\r\n\r\nThe supposition, therefore, of the subsidence of the former ocean,\r\nfor the purpose of discovering the present land, is beset with more\r\ndifficulty than the simple erection of the bottom of the former ocean;\r\nfor, _first_, There is a place to provide for the retirement of the\r\nwaters of the ocean; and, _2dly_, There is required a work of equal\r\nmagnitude; this is, the swallowing up of that former continent, which\r\nhad procured the materials of the present land.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the subsiding of the surface of the ocean would but\r\nmake the former land appear the higher; and, on the other, the sinking\r\nthe body of the former land into the solid globe, so as to swallow up\r\nthe greater part of the ocean after it, if not a natural impossibility,\r\nwould be at least a superfluous exertion of the power of nature. Such an\r\noperation as this would discover as little wisdom in the end elected, as\r\nin the means appropriated to that end; for, if the land be not wasted\r\nand worn away in the natural operations of the globe, Why make such a\r\nconvulsion in the world in order to renew the land? If, again, the land\r\nnaturally decays, Why employ so extraordinary a power, in order to hide\r\na former continent of land, and puzzle man?\r\n\r\nLet us now consider how far the other proposition, of strata being\r\nelevated by the power of heat above the level of the sea, may be\r\nconfirmed from the examination of natural appearances.\r\n\r\nThe strata formed at the bottom of the ocean are necessarily horizontal\r\nin their position, or nearly so, and continuous in their horizontal\r\ndirection or extent. They may change, and gradually assume the nature of\r\neach other, so far as concerns the materials of which they are formed;\r\nbut there cannot be any sudden change, fracture, or displacement,\r\nnaturally in the body of a stratum. But, if these strata are cemented by\r\nthe heat of fusion, and erected with an expansive power acting below,\r\nwe may expect to find every species of fracture, dislocation, and\r\ncontortion, in those bodies, and every degree of departure from a\r\nhorizontal towards a vertical position.\r\n\r\nThe strata of the globe are actually found in every possible position:\r\nFor, from horizontal, they are frequently found vertical; from\r\ncontinuous, they are broken and separated in every possible direction;\r\nand, from a plane, they are bent and doubled. It is impossible that they\r\ncould have originally been formed, by the known laws of nature, in their\r\npresent state and position; and the power that has been necessarily\r\nrequired for their change, has not been inferior to that which might\r\nhave been required for their elevation from the place in which they had\r\nbeen formed.\r\n\r\nIn this cafe, natural appearances are not anomalous. They are, indeed,\r\ninfinitely various, as they ought to be, according to the rule; but all\r\nthose varieties in appearances conspire to prove one general truth, viz.\r\nThat all which we see had been originally composed according to certain\r\nprinciples, established in the constitution of the terraqueous globe;\r\nand that those regular compositions had been afterwards greatly changed\r\nby the operations of another power, which had introduced apparent\r\nconfusion among things first formed in order and by rule.\r\n\r\nIt is concerning the operation of this second power that we are now\r\ninquiring; and here the apparent irregularity and disorder of the\r\nmineral regions are as instructive, with regard to what had been\r\ntransacted in a former period of time, as the order and regularity of\r\nthose same regions are conclusive, in relation to the place in which a\r\nformer state of things had produced that which, in its changed state, we\r\nnow perceive.\r\n\r\nWe are now to conclude, that the land on which we dwell had been\r\nelevated from a lower situation by the same agent which had been\r\nemployed in consolidating the strata, in giving them stability, and\r\npreparing them for the purpose of the living world. This agent is matter\r\nactuated by extreme heat, and expanded with amazing force.\r\n\r\nIf this has been the case, it will be reasonable to expect, that some of\r\nthe expanded matter might be found condensed in the bodies which have\r\nbeen heated by that igneous vapour; and that matter, foreign to the\r\nstrata, may have been thus introduced into the fractures and separations\r\nof those indurated masses.\r\n\r\nWe have but to open our eyes to be convinced of this truth. Look into\r\nthe sources of our mineral treasures; ask the miner, from whence has\r\ncome the metal into his vein? Not from the earth or air above,--not from\r\nthe strata which the vein traverses; these do not contain one atom of\r\nthe minerals now considered. There is but one place from whence these\r\nminerals may have come; this is the bowels of the earth, the place of\r\npower and expansion, the place from whence must have proceeded that\r\nintense heat by which loose materials have been consolidated into rocks,\r\nas well as that enormous force by which the regular strata have been\r\nbroken and displaced.\r\n\r\nOur attention is here peculiarly called upon, where we have the\r\nopportunity of examining those mineral bodies, which have immediately\r\nproceeded from the unknown region, that place of power and energy which\r\nwe want to explore; for, if such is the system of the earth, that\r\nmaterials are first deposited at the bottom of the ocean, there to be\r\nprepared in a certain manner, in order to acquire solidity, and then to\r\nbe elevated into the proper place of land, these mineral veins, which\r\ncontain matter absolutely foreign to the surface of the earth, afford\r\nthe most authentic information with regard to the operations which we\r\nwant to understand. It is these veins which we are to consider as,\r\nin some measure, the continuation of that mineral region, which lies\r\nnecessarily out of all possible reach of our examination. It is,\r\ntherefore, peculiarly interesting to know the state in which things\r\nare to be found in this place, which may be considered as intermediate\r\nbetween the solid land, upon the one hand, and the unknown regions of\r\nthe earth, upon the other.\r\n\r\nWe are now to examine those mineral veins; and these may be considered,\r\nfirst, in relation to their form, independent of their substance or\r\nparticular contents; and, secondly, in relation to the contained bodies,\r\nindependent of their form.\r\n\r\nIn examining consolidated strata, we remarked veins and cutters as a\r\nproof of the means by which those bodies had been consolidated. In that\r\ncase, the formation of these veins is a regulated process, determined\r\nby the degree of fusion, and the circumstances of condensation or\r\nrefrigeration. In respect of these, the mineral veins now to be examined\r\nare anomalous. They are; but we know not why or how. We see the effect;\r\nbut, in that effect, we do not see the cause. We can say, negatively,\r\nthat the cause of mineral veins is not that by which the veins and\r\nfissures of consolidated strata have been formed; consequently, that\r\nit is not the measured contraction and regulated condensation of the\r\nconsolidated land which has formed those general mineral veins; however,\r\nveins, similar in many respects, have been formed by the cooperation of\r\nthis cause.\r\n\r\nHaving thus taken a view of the evident distinction between the veins or\r\ncontractions that are particular to the consolidated body in which they\r\nare found, and those more general veins which are not limited to that\r\ncause, we may now consider what is general in the subject, or what is\r\nuniversal in these effects of which we wish to investigate the cause.\r\n\r\nThe event of highest generalization or universality, in the form of\r\nthose mineral veins, is fracture and dislocation. It is not, like that\r\nof the veins of strata, simple separation and measured contraction; it\r\nis violent fracture and unlimited dislocation. In the one case, the\r\nforming cause is in the body which is separated; for, after the body had\r\nbeen actuated by heat, it is by the reaction of the proper matter of the\r\nbody, that the chasm which constitutes the vein is formed. In the other\r\ncase, again, the cause is extrinsic in relation to the body in which the\r\nchasm is formed. There has been the most violent fracture and divulsion;\r\nbut the cause is still to seek; and it appears not in the vein; for it\r\nis not every fracture and dislocation of the solid body of our earth, in\r\nwhich minerals, or the proper substances of mineral veins, are found.\r\n\r\nWe are now examining matter of fact, real effects, from whence we would\r\ninvestigate the nature of certain events which do not now appear. Of\r\nthese, two kinds occur; one which has relation to the hardness and\r\nsolidity, or the natural constitution of the body; the other, to its\r\nshape or local situation. The first has been already considered; the\r\nlast is now the subject of inquiry.\r\n\r\nBut, in examining those natural appearances, we find two different kinds\r\nof veins; the one necessarily connected with the consolidating cause;\r\nthe other with that cause of which we now particularly inquire. For,\r\nin those great mineral veins, violent fracture and dislocation is the\r\nprinciple; but there is no other principle upon which strata, or masses\r\nformed at the bottom of the sea, can be placed at a height above its\r\nsurface. Hence, in those two different operations, of forming mineral\r\nveins, and erecting strata from a lower to a higher place, the principle\r\nis the same; for, neither can be done without violent fracture and\r\ndislocation.\r\n\r\nWe now only want to know, how far it is by the same power, as well as\r\nupon the same principle, that these two operations have been made.\r\nAn expansive force, acting from below, is the power most proper for\r\nerecting masses; but whether it is a power of the same nature with that\r\nwhich has been employed in forming mineral veins, will best appear in\r\nknowing the nature of their contents. These, therefore, may be now\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nEvery species of fracture, and every degree of dislocation and\r\ncontortion, may be perceived in the form of mineral veins; and there is\r\nno other general principle to be observed in examining their form. But,\r\nin examining their contents, some other principle may appear, so far as,\r\nto the dislocating power or force, there may be superadded matter, by\r\nwhich something in relation to the nature of the power may be known.\r\nIf, for example, a tree or a rock shall be found simply split asunder,\r\nalthough there be no doubt with regard to some power having been applied\r\nin order to produce the effect, yet we are left merely to conjecture at\r\nthe power. But when wedges of wood or iron, or frozen water, should be\r\nfound lodged in the cleft, we might be enabled, from this appearance, to\r\nform a certain judgment with regard to the nature of the power which\r\nhad been applied. This is the case with mineral veins. We find them\r\ncontaining matter, which indicates a cause; and every information in\r\nthis case is interesting to the theory.\r\n\r\nThe substances contained in mineral veins are precisely the same with\r\nthose which, in the former section, we have considered as being made\r\ninstrumental in the consolidation of strata; and they are found mixed\r\nand concreted in every manner possible.\r\n\r\nBut, besides this evidence for the exertion of extreme heat, in that\r\nprocess by which those veins were filled, there is another important\r\nobservation to be gathered from the inspection of this subject. There\r\nappears to have been a great mechanical power employed in the filling of\r\nthese veins, as well as that necessarily required in making the first\r\nfracture and divulsion.\r\n\r\nThis appears from the order of the contents, or filling of these veins,\r\nwhich is a thing often observed to be various and successive. But what\r\nit is chiefly now in view to illustrate, is that immense force which is\r\nmanifested in the fracture and dispersion of the solid contents which\r\nhad formerly filled those veins. Here we find fragments of rock and spar\r\nfloating in the body of a vein filled with metallic substances; there,\r\nagain, we see the various fragments of metallic masses floating in the\r\nsparry and siliceous contents.\r\n\r\nOne thing is demonstrable from the inspection of the veins and their\r\ncontents; this is, the successive irruptions of those fluid substances\r\nbreaking the solid bodies which they meet, and floating those fragments\r\nof the broken bodies in the vein. It is very common to see three\r\nsuccessive series of those operations; and all this may be perceived in\r\na small fragment of stone, which a man of science may examine in his\r\ncloset, often better than descending to the mine, where all the examples\r\nare found on an enlarged scale.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider what power would be required to force up, from the\r\nmost unfathomable depth of the ocean, to the Andes or the Alps, a column\r\nof fluid metal and of stone. This power cannot be much less than that\r\nrequired to elevate the highest land upon the globe. Whether, therefore,\r\nwe shall consider the general veins as having been filled by mineral\r\nsteams, or by fluid minerals, an elevating power of immense force is\r\nstill required, in order to form as well as fill those veins. But such a\r\npower acting under the consolidated masses at the bottom of the sea, is\r\nthe only natural means for making those masses land.\r\n\r\nIf such have been the operations that are necessary for the production\r\nof this land; and if these operations are natural to the globe of this\r\nearth, as being the effect of wisdom in its contrivance, we shall\r\nhave reason to look for the actual manifestation of this truth in the\r\nphaenomena of nature, or those appearances which more immediately\r\ndiscover the actual cause in the perceived effect.\r\n\r\nTo see the evidence of marble, a body that is solid, having been formed\r\nof loose materials collected at the bottom of the sea, is not always\r\neasy, although it may be made abundantly plain; and to be convinced that\r\nthis calcareous stone, which calcines so easily in our fires, should\r\nhave been brought into fusion by subterraneous heat, without suffering\r\ncalcination, must require a chain of reasoning which every one is not\r\nable to attain[13]. But when fire bursts forth from the bottom of the\r\nsea, and when the land is heaved up and down, so as to demolish cities\r\nin an instant, and split asunder rocks and solid mountains, there\r\nis nobody but must see in this a power, which may be sufficient to\r\naccomplish every view of nature in erecting land, as it is situated in\r\nthe place most advantageous for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[Note 13: Mr le Chevalier de Dolomieu, in considering the different\r\neffects of heat, has made the following observation; Journal de\r\nPhysique, Mai 1792.\r\n\r\n\"Je dis _le feu tel que nous l'employons_ pour distinguer le feu naturel\r\ndes volcans, du feu de nos fourneaux et de celui de nos chalumeaux. Nous\r\nsommes obligés de donner une grande activité à son action pour suppléer\r\net au volume qui ne seroit pas à notre disposition et au tems que nous\r\nsommes forcés de ménager, et cette manière d'appliquer une chaleur\r\ntrès-active, communique le mouvement et le désordre jusques dans les\r\nmolécules constituantes. Agrégation et composition, tout est troublé.\r\nDans les volcans la grand masse du feu supplée à son intensité, le\r\ntems remplace son activité, de manière qu'il tourmente moins les corps\r\nfournis à son action; il ménage leur composition en relâchant leur\r\nagrégation, et les pierres qui eut été rendues fluides par l'embrasement\r\nvolcanique peuvent reprendre leur état primitif; la plupart des\r\nsubstances qu'un feu plus actif auroit expulsées y restent encore. Voilà\r\npourquoi les laves ressemblent tellement aux pierres naturelles des\r\nespèces analogues, qu'elles ne peuvent en être distinguées; voilà\r\négalement pourquoi les verres volcaniques eux-même renferment encore des\r\nsubstances élastiques qui les font boursoufler lorsque nous les fondons\r\nde nouveau, et pourquoi ces verres blanchissent aussi, pour lors, par\r\nla dissipation, d'une substance grasse qui a résisté à la chaleur des\r\nvolcans, et que volatilise la chaleur par laquelle nous obtenons leur\r\nsecond fusion.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt, the long application of heat may produce changes in bodies\r\nvery different from those which are occasioned by the sudden application\r\nof a more intense heat; but still there must be sufficient intensity in\r\nthat power, so as to cause fluidity, without which no chemical change\r\ncan be produced in bodies. The essential difference, however, between\r\nthe natural heat of the mineral regions, and that which we excite upon\r\nthe surface of the earth, consists in this; that nature applies heat\r\nunder circumstances which we are not able to imitate, that is, under\r\nsuch compression as shall prevent the decomposition of the constituent\r\nsubstances, by the separation of the more volatile from the more fixed\r\nparts. This is a circumstance which, so far as I know, no chemist\r\nor naturalist has hitherto considered; and it is that by which the\r\noperations of the mineral regions must certainly be explained. Without\r\nattending to this great principle in the mineralizing operations\r\nof subterraneous fire, it is impossible to conceive the fusion and\r\nconcretion of those various bodies, which we examine when brought up to\r\nthe surface of the earth.]\r\n\r\nThe only question, therefore, which it concerns us to decide at present,\r\nis, Whether those operations of extreme heat, and violent mechanic\r\nforce, be only in the system as a matter of accident; or if, on the\r\ncontrary, they are operations natural to the globe, and necessary in the\r\nproduction of such land as this which we inhabit? The answer to this is\r\nplain: These operations of the globe remain at present with undiminished\r\nactivity, or in the fullness of their power.\r\n\r\nA stream of melted lava flows from the sides of Mount Aetna. Here is a\r\ncolumn of weighty matter raised from a great depth below, to an immense\r\nheight above, the level of the sea, and rocks of an enormous size\r\nare projected from its orifice some miles into the air. Every one\r\nacknowledges that here is the liquefying power and expansive force of\r\nsubterranean fire, or violent heat. But, that Sicily itself had been\r\nraised from the bottom of the ocean, and that the marble called Sicilian\r\nJasper, had its solidity upon the same principle with the lava, would\r\nstumble many a naturalist to acknowledge. Nevertheless, I have in my\r\npossession a table of this marble, from which it is demonstrable, that\r\nthis calcareous stone had flowed, and been in such a state of fusion and\r\nfluidity as lava.\r\n\r\nHere is a comparison formed of two mineral substances, to which it is of\r\nthe highest importance to attend. The solidity and present state of the\r\none of these is commonly thought to be the operation of fire; of the\r\nother, again, it is thought to be that of water. This, however, is not\r\nthe case. The immediate state and condition of both these bodies is now\r\nto be considered as equally the effect of fire or heat. The reason of\r\nour forming such a different judgment with regard to these two subjects\r\nis this; we see, in the one case, the more immediate connection of the\r\ncause and the effect, while, in the other, we have only the effects from\r\nwhence we are in science to investigate the cause.\r\n\r\nBut, if it were necessary always to see this immediate connection, in\r\norder to acknowledge the operation of a power which, at present, is\r\nextinguished in the effect, we should lose the benefit of science, or\r\ngeneral principles, from whence particulars may be deduced, and we\r\nshould be able to reason no better than the brute. Man is made for\r\nscience; he reasons from effects to causes, and from causes to effects;\r\nbut he does not always reason without error. In reasoning, therefore,\r\nfrom appearances which are particular, care must be taken how we\r\ngeneralise; we should be cautious not to attribute to nature, laws which\r\nmay perhaps be only of our own invention.\r\n\r\nThe immediate question now before us is not, If the subterraneous fire,\r\nor elevating power, which we perceive sometimes as operating with such\r\nenergy, be the consolidating cause of strata formed at the bottom of the\r\nsea; nor, if that power be the means of making land appear above the\r\ngeneral surface of the water? for, though this be the end we want to\r\narrive at ultimately, the question at present in agitation respects the\r\nlaws of nature, or the generality of particular appearances.\r\n\r\nHas the globe within it such an active power as fits it for the\r\nrenovation of that part of its constitution which may be subject to\r\ndecay? Are those powerful operations of fire, or subterraneous heat,\r\nwhich so often have filled us with terror and astonishment, to be\r\nconsidered as having always been? Are they to be concluded as proper to\r\nevery part upon the globe, and as continual in the system of this earth?\r\nIf these points in question shall be decided in the affirmative, we can\r\nbe at no loss in ascertaining the power which has consolidated strata,\r\nnor in explaining the present situation of those bodies, which had their\r\norigin at the bottom of the sea. This, therefore, should be the object\r\nof our pursuit; and in order to have demonstration in a case of physical\r\ninquiry, we must again have recourse to the book of nature.\r\n\r\nThe general tendency of heat is to produce fluidity and softness; as\r\nthat of cold is, on the contrary, to harden soft and fluid bodies. But\r\nthis softening power of heat is not uniform in its nature; it is made to\r\nact with very different effect, according to the nature of the substance\r\nto which it is applied. We are but limited in the art of increasing the\r\nheat or the cold of bodies; we find, however, extreme difference in\r\ntheir substances with respect to fusibility.\r\n\r\nA fusible substance, or mineral composition in a fluid state, is emitted\r\nfrom those places of the earth at which subterraneous fire and expansive\r\nforce are manifested in those eruptive operations. In examining these\r\nemitted bodies, men of science find a character for such productions, in\r\ngeneralising the substance, and understanding the natural constitution\r\nof those bodies. It is in this manner that such a person, finding a\r\npiece of lava in any place of the earth, says with certainty, Here is a\r\nstone which had congealed from a melted state.\r\n\r\nHaving thus found a distinguishing character for those fused substances\r\ncalled, in general, Lavas, and having the most visible marks for that\r\nwhich had been actually a volcano, naturalists, in examining different\r\ncountries, have discovered the most undoubted proofs of many ancient\r\nvolcanos, which had not been before suspected. Thus, volcanos will\r\nappear to be not a matter of accident, or as only happening in a\r\nparticular place, they are general to the globe, so far as there is\r\nno place upon the earth that may not have an eruption of this kind;\r\nalthough it is by no means necessary for every place to have had those\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nVolcanos are natural to the globe, as general operations; but we are\r\nnot to consider nature as having a burning mountain for an end in her\r\nintention, or as a principal purpose in the general system of this\r\nworld. The end of nature in placing an internal fire or power of heat,\r\nand a force of irresistible expansion, in the body of this earth, is to\r\nconsolidate the sediment collected at the bottom of the sea, and to form\r\nthereof a mass of permanent land above the level of the ocean, for the\r\npurpose of maintaining plants and animals. The power appointed for this\r\npurpose is, as on all other occasions, where the operation is important,\r\nand where there is any danger of a shortcoming, wisely provided\r\nin abundance; and there are contrived means for disposing of the\r\nredundancy. These, in the present case, are our volcanos.\r\n\r\nA volcano is not made on purpose to frighten superstitious people\r\ninto fits of piety and devotion, nor to overwhelm devoted cities with\r\ndestruction; a volcano should be considered as a spiracle to the\r\nsubterranean furnace, in order to prevent the unnecessary elevation of\r\nland, and fatal effects of earthquakes; and we may rest assured, that\r\nthey, in general, wisely answer the end of their intention, without\r\nbeing in themselves an end, for which nature had exerted such amazing\r\npower and excellent contrivance.\r\n\r\nLet us take a view of the most elevated places of the earth; if the\r\npresent theory is just, it is there that we should find volcanos. But is\r\nnot this the case? There are volcanos in the Andes; and round the Alps\r\nwe find many volcanos, which are in France upon the one side, and in\r\nGermany upon the other, as well as upon the Italian side, where Vesuvius\r\nstill continues to exhibit violent eruptions.\r\n\r\nIt is not meant to allege, that it is only upon the summit of a\r\ncontinent volcanos should appear. Subterraneous fire has sometimes made\r\nits appearance in bursting from the bottom of the sea. But, even in\r\nthis last case, land was raised from the bottom of the sea, before the\r\neruption made its exit into the atmosphere. It must also be evident,\r\nthat, in this case of the new island near Santorini, had the expansive\r\npower been retained, instead of being discharged, much more land might\r\nhave been raised above the level of the ocean.\r\n\r\nNow, the eruption of that elastic force through the bottom of the sea,\r\nmay be considered as a waste of power in the operations of the globe,\r\nwhere the elevation of indurated strata is an object in the exertion of\r\nthat power; whereas, in the centre of a continent sufficiently elevated\r\nabove the level of the sea, the eruption of that fiery vapour calculated\r\nto elevate the land, while it may occasionally destroy the habitations\r\nof a few, provides for the security and quiet possession of the many.\r\n\r\nIn order to see the wisdom of this contrivance, let us consider the\r\ntwo extreme places at which this eruption of ignited matter may be\r\nperformed. These are, on the one hand, within a continent of land, and,\r\non the other, at the bottom of the ocean. In the one case, the free\r\neruption of the expanding power should be permitted; because the purpose\r\nfor which it had been calculated to exist has been accomplished. In\r\nthe other, again, the free eruption of that powerful matter should be\r\nrepressed; because there is reserved for that power much of another\r\noperation in that place. But, according to the wise constitution of\r\nthings, this must necessarily happen. The eruption of the fiery\r\nvapour from volcanos on the continent or land, is interrupted only\r\noccasionally, by the melted bodies flowing in the subterraneous\r\nchimney; whereas, at the bottom of the ocean, the contact of the water\r\nnecessarily tends to close the orifice, by accumulating condensed matter\r\nupon the weakest place.\r\n\r\nIf this be a just theory of the natural operations of the globe, we\r\nshall have reason to expect, that great quantities of this melted\r\nmatter, or fusible substance, may be found in form of lava, among the\r\nstrata of the earth, where there are no visible marks of any volcano, or\r\nburning mountain, having existed. Here, therefore, is an important point\r\nto be determined; for, if it shall appear that much of this melted\r\nmatter, analogous to lava, has been forced to flow among the strata\r\nwhich had been formed at the bottom of the sea, and now are found\r\nforming dry land above its surface, it will be allowed, that we have\r\ndiscovered the secret operations of nature concocting future land, as\r\nwell as those by which the present habitable earth had been produced\r\nfrom the bottom of the abyss. Here, therefore, we shall at present rest\r\nthe argument, with endeavouring to show that such is actually the case.\r\n\r\nIt appears from Cronstedt's Mineralogy, that the rock-stone, called trap\r\nby the Swedes, the amygdaloides and the schwarts-stein of the Germans,\r\nare the same with the whin-stone of this country. This is also fully\r\nconfirmed by specimens from Sweden, sent me by my friend Dr Gahn.\r\nWhatever, therefore, shall be ascertained with regard to our whin-stone,\r\nmay be so far generalized or extended to the countries of Norway,\r\nSweden, and Germany.\r\n\r\nThe whin-stone of Scotland is also the same with the toad-stone of\r\nDerbyshire, which is of the amygdaloides species; it is also the same\r\nwith the flagstone of the south of Staffordshire, which is a simple\r\nwhin-stone, or perfect trap. England, therefore, must be included in\r\nthis great space of land, the mineral operations of which we explore;\r\nand also Ireland, of which the Giant's Causeway, and many others, are\r\nsufficient proof.\r\n\r\nIn the south of Scotland, there is a ridge of hills, which extends\r\nfrom the west side of the island in Galloway to the east side in\r\nBerwickshire, composed of granite, of schistus, and of siliceous strata.\r\nThe Grampians on the north, again, form another range of mountains of\r\nthe same kind; and between these two great fields of broken, tumbled,\r\nand distorted strata, there lies a field of lesser hardness and\r\nconsolidation, in general; but a field in which there is a great\r\nmanifestation of subterraneous fire, and of exerted force.\r\n\r\nThe strata in this space consist, in general, of sand-stone, coal,\r\nlime-stone or marble, iron-stone, and marl or argillaceous strata, with\r\nstrata of analogous bodies, and the various compositions of these. But\r\nwhat is to the present purpose is this, that, through all this space,\r\nthere are interspersed immense quantities of whinstone; a body which is\r\nto be distinguished as very different from lava; and now the disposition\r\nof this whin-stone is to be considered.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is found in an irregular mass or mountain, as Mr Cronstedt\r\nhas properly observed; but he has also said, that this is not the case\r\nin general. His words are: \"It is oftener found in form of veins in\r\nmountains of another kind, running commonly in a serpentine manner,\r\ncontrary or across to the direction of the rock itself.\"\r\n\r\nThe origin of this form, in which the trap or whin-stone appears, is\r\nmost evident to inspection, when we consider that this solid body had\r\nbeen in a fluid state, and introduced, in that state, among strata,\r\nwhich preserved their proper form. The strata appear to have been\r\nbroken, and the two correspondent parts of those strata are separated to\r\nadmit the flowing mass of whin-stone.\r\n\r\nA fine example of this kind may be seen upon the south side of the\r\nEarn, on the road to Crief. It is twenty-four yards wide, stands\r\nperpendicular, and appears many feet above the surface of the ground. It\r\nruns from that eastward, and would seem to be the same with that which\r\ncrosses the river Tay, in forming Campsy-lin above Stanley, as a lesser\r\none of the same kind does below it. I have seen it at Lednoc upon the\r\nAmmon, where it forms a cascade in that river, about five or six\r\nmiles west of Campsy-lin. It appears to run from the Tay east through\r\nStrathmore, so that it may be considered as having been traced for\r\ntwenty or thirty miles, and westwards to Drummond castle, perhaps much\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nTwo small veins of the same kind, only two or three feet wide, may be\r\nseen in the bed of the Water of Leith, traversing the horizontal strata,\r\nthe one is above St Bernard's well, the other immediately below it. But,\r\nmore particularly, in the shire of Ayr, to the north of Irvine, there\r\nare to be seen upon the coast, between that and Scarmorly, in the space\r\nof about twenty miles, more than twenty or thirty such dykes (as they\r\nare called) of whin-stone. Some of them are of a great thickness; and,\r\nin some places, there is perceived a short one, running at right angles,\r\nand communicating with other two that run parallel.\r\n\r\nThere is in this country, and in Derbyshire[14], another regular\r\nappearance of this stone, which Cronstedt has not mentioned. In this\r\ncase, the strata are not broken in order to have the whin-stone\r\nintroduced, they are separated, and the whin-stone is interjected in\r\nform of strata, having various degrees of regularity, and being of\r\ndifferent thickness. On the south side of Edinburgh, I have seen, in\r\nlittle more than the space of a mile from east to west, nine or ten\r\nmasses of whin-stone interjected among the strata. These masses of\r\nwhin-stone are from three or four to an hundred feet thick, running\r\nparallel in planes inclined to the horizon, and forming with it an angle\r\nof about twenty or thirty degrees, as may be seen at all times in the\r\nhill of Salisbury Craggs.\r\n\r\n[Note 14: See Mr Whitehurst's Theory of the Earth.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus described these masses, which have flowed by means of\r\nheat among the strata of the globe, strata which had been formed by\r\nsubsidence at the bottom of the sea, it will now be proper to examine\r\nthe difference that subsists between these subterraneous lavas, as they\r\nmay be termed, and the analogous bodies which are proper lavas, in\r\nhaving issued out of a volcano.[15]\r\n\r\n[Note 15: The Chevalier de Dolomieu, in his accurate examination of\r\nAetna and the Lipari islands, has very well observed the distinction of\r\nthese two different species of lavas; but without seeming to know the\r\nprinciple upon which this essential difference depends. No bias of\r\nsystem, therefore, can here be supposed as perverting the Chevalier's\r\nview, in taking those observations; and these are interesting to the\r\npresent theory, as corresponding perfectly with the facts from whence it\r\nhas been formed. It will be proper to give the account of these in his\r\nown words.\r\n\r\nLa zéolite est très-commune dans certains laves de l'Ethna; il seroit\r\npeut-être possible d'y en rencontrer des morceaux aussi gros que ceux\r\nque fournit l'isle de Ferroé. Quoique cette substance semble ici\r\nappartenir aux laves, je ne dirai cependant point que toutes les\r\nzéolites soient volcaniques, ou unies à des matières volcaniques; celles\r\nque l'on trouve en Allemagne sont, dit-on, dans des circonstances\r\ndifférentes; mais je doit annoncer que je n'ai trouvé cette substance en\r\nSicile, que dans les seules laves qui évidemment ont coulé dans la mer,\r\net qui out été recouvertes par ses eaux. La zéolite des laves n'est\r\npoint une déjection volcanique, ni une production du feu, ni même un\r\nmatière que les laves aient enveloppée lorsqu'elles étoient fluides;\r\nelle est le résultat d'une opération et d'une combinaison postérieure,\r\nauxquelles les eaux de la mer ont concouru. Les laves qui n'ont pas été\r\nsubmergées, n'en contiennent jamais. J'ai trouvé ces observations si\r\nconstantes, que par-tout où je rencontrois de la zéolite, j'étois sûr\r\nde trouver d'autres preuves de submersion, et partout où je voyois des\r\nlaves recouvertes des dépôts de l'eau, j'étois sûr de trouver de la\r\nzéolite, et un de ces faits m'a toujours indiqué l'autre. Je me suis\r\nservi avec succès de cette observation pour diriger mes recherches, et\r\npour connoître l'antiquité des laves. _Minéralogie de Volcans, par\r\nM. Faujas de Saint-Fond_. Here would appear to be the distinction of\r\nsubterraneous lava, in which zeolite and calcareous spar may be found,\r\nand that which has flowed from a volcano, in which neither of these are\r\never observed.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that these two different species of bodies have\r\nhad the same origin, and that they are composed of the same materials\r\nnearly; but from the different circumstances Of their production, there\r\nis formed a character to these bodies, by which, they may be perfectly\r\ndistinguished. The difference of those circumstances consists in this;\r\nthe one has been emitted to the atmosphere in its fluid state the other\r\nonly came to be exposed to the light in a long course of time, after it\r\nhad congealed under the compression of an immense load of earth, and\r\nafter certain operations, proper to the mineral regions, had been\r\nexercised upon the indurated mass. This is the cause of the difference\r\nbetween those erupted lavas, and our whin-stone, toad-stone, and the\r\nSwedish trap, which may be termed subterraneous lava. The visible\r\neffects of those different operations may now be mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the erupted lavas, those substances which are subject to calcine and\r\nvitrify in our fires, suffer similar changes, when delivered from a\r\ncompression which had rendered them fixed, though in an extremely heated\r\nstate. Thus, a lava in which there is much calcareous spar, when it\r\ncomes to be exposed to the atmosphere, or delivered from the compressing\r\nforce of its confinement, effervesces by the explosion of its fixed\r\nair; the calcareous earth, at the same time, vitrifies with the other\r\nsubstances. Hence such violent ebullition in volcanos, and hence the\r\nemission of so much pumice-stone and ashes, which are of the same\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIn the body of our whin-stone, on the contrary, there is no mark of\r\ncalcination or vitrification. We frequently find in it much calcareous\r\nspar, or the _terra calcarea aerata_, which had been in a melted state\r\nby heat, and had been crystallized by congelation into a sparry form.\r\nSuch is the _lapis amygdaloides_, and many of our whin-stone rocks,\r\nwhich contain pebbles crystallized and variously figured, both\r\ncalcareous, siliceous, and of a mixture in which both these substances\r\nform distinct parts. The specimens of this kind, which I have from the\r\nwhin-stone or porphyry rock of the Calton-hill, exhibit every species\r\nof mineral operation, in forming jasper, figured agate, and marble; and\r\nthey demonstrate, that this had been performed by heat or fusion.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say, that this demonstration is direct; it is\r\nconditional, and proceeds upon the supposition, that the basaltic or\r\nporphyry rock, in which those specimens are found, is a body which had\r\nbeen in a melted state. Now, this is a supposition for which I have\r\nabundance of evidence, were it required; but naturalists are now\r\nsufficiently disposed to admit that proposition; they even draw\r\nconclusions from this fact, which, I think, they are not sufficiently\r\nwarranted in doing; that is, from this appearance, they infer the former\r\nexistence of volcanos in those places. For my part, though I have made\r\nthe most strict examination, I never saw any vestige of such an event.\r\nThat there are, in other countries, evident marks of volcanos which\r\nhave been long extinguished, is unquestionably true; but naturalists,\r\nimagining that there are no other marks of subterraneous fire and\r\nfusion, except in the production of a lava, attribute to a volcano, as\r\na cause, these effects, which only indicate the exertion of that power\r\nwhich might have been the cause of a volcano.\r\n\r\nIf the theory now given be just, a rock of marble is no less a mark\r\nof subterraneous fire and fusion, than that of the basaltes; and the\r\nflowing of basaltic streams among strata broken and displaced, affords\r\nthe most satisfactory evidence of those operations by which the body of\r\nour land had been elevated above the surface of the sea; but it gives no\r\nproof that the eruptive force of mineral vapours had been discharged in\r\na burning mountain. Now, this discharge is essential in the proper idea\r\nof a volcano.\r\n\r\nBesides this internal mark of an unerupted lava in the substance of the\r\nstone or body of the flowing mass, there are others which belong to it\r\nin common with all other mineral strata, consolidated by subterraneous\r\nfire, and changed from the place of their original formation; this is,\r\nthe being broken and dislocated, and having veins of foreign matter\r\nformed in their separations and contractions.\r\n\r\nIf these are mineral operations, proper to the lower regions of the\r\nearth, and exerted upon bodies under immense compression, such things\r\nwill be sometimes found in the unerupted lavas, as well as in the\r\ncontiguous bodies with which they are associated. If, on the contrary,\r\nthese are operations proper to the surface of the earth, where the\r\ndissolving power of water and air take place, and where certain\r\nstalactical and ferruginous concretions are produced by these means;\r\nthen, in erupted lavas, we should find mineral concretions, which\r\nconcretions should be denied to bodies which had been consolidated at\r\nthe bottom of the sea; that is to say, where, without the operation of\r\nsubterraneous fire, no changes of that kind could have taken place, as\r\nhas already been observed. But in the unerupted species of lava, that\r\nis to say, in our whin-stone, every species of mineral appearance is\r\noccasionally to be found. Let those who have the opportunity to examine,\r\nsay, what arc to be found in proper lavas, that is, those of the erupted\r\nkind. Sir William Hamilton informed me, when I showed him those mineral\r\nveins and spars in our whin-stone, that he had never observed the like,\r\nin lavas We have now formed some conclusions with regard to the nature\r\nand production of those parts of the land of this globe which we\r\nhave had the means of examining perfectly; but; from the accounts of\r\ntravellers, and from, the specimens which are brought to us from distant\r\nparts, we have reason to believe, that all the rest of the earth is\r\nof the same nature with that which has been now considered. The great\r\nmasses of the earth are the same every where; and all the different\r\nspecies of earths, of rocks or stone, which have as yet appeared, are to\r\nbe found in the little space of this our island.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that there are peculiar productions in the mineral kingdom\r\nwhich are rare, as being found only in few places; but these things are\r\nmerely accidental in relation to the land, for they belong in property\r\nto those parts of the mineral region which we never see. Such are, the\r\ndiamond of the east, the platina of the west, and the tin of Cornwall,\r\nGermany, and Sumatra. Gold and silver, though found in many countries,\r\ndo not appear to be immediately necessary in the production of a\r\nhabitable country. Iron, again, is universal in the operations of the\r\nglobe, and is found often in that profusion which equals its utility.\r\nBetween these two extremes, we find all other minerals, that is to say,\r\nhere and there in moderate quantity, and apparently in some proportion\r\nto their use. But all these substances are to be considered as the\r\nvapours of the mineral regions, condensed occasionally in the crevices\r\nof the land; and it is only the rocks and strata (in which those mineral\r\nveins are found) that are now examined with regard to their original\r\ncomposition, at the bottom of the sea, as well as to that, operation by\r\nwhich those bodies had been indurated in their substance, and elevated\r\nfrom the place in which they had been formed.\r\n\r\nThus, we have sufficient reason to believe, that, in knowing the\r\nconstruction of the land in Europe, we know the constitution of the land\r\nin every part of the globe. Therefore, we may proceed to form general\r\nconclusions, from the knowledge of the mineral region, thus acquired in\r\nstudying those parts which are seen.\r\n\r\nHaving thus found, _first_, That the consolidated and indurated masses\r\nof our strata had suffered the effects of violent heat and fusion;\r\n_2dly_, That those strata, which had been formed in a regular manner at\r\nthe bottom of the sea, have been violently bended, broken, and removed\r\nfrom their original place and situation; and, _lastly_, Having now found\r\nthe most indubitable proof, that the melting, breaking, and removing\r\npower of subterraneous fire, has been actually exerted upon this land\r\nwhich we examine, we cannot hesitate in ascribing these operations as a\r\ncause to those effects which are exposed to our view. Now, these may be\r\nconsidered as consisting in the solid state and present situation of\r\nthose stratified bodies, originally formed by subsidence in the ocean;\r\nappearances which cannot, in reason, be ascribed to any other cause, and\r\nwhich, upon this principle, are perfectly explained.\r\n\r\nIt is not meant to specify every particular in the means employed by\r\nnature for the elevation of our land. It is sufficient to have shown,\r\nthat there is, in nature, means employed for the consolidating of\r\nstrata, formed originally of loose and incoherent materials; and that\r\nthose same means have also been employed in changing the place and\r\nsituation of those strata. But how describe an operation which man\r\ncannot have any opportunity of perceiving? Or how imagine that, for\r\nwhich, perhaps, there are not proper data to be found? We only know,\r\nthat the land is raised by a power which has for principle subterraneous\r\nheat; but, how that land is preserved in its elevated station, is a\r\nsubject in which we have not even the means to form conjecture; at\r\nleast, we ought to be cautious how we indulge conjecture in a subject\r\nwhere no means occur for trying that which is but supposition.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed, from the facts which have been properly established, to\r\nreason with regard to the duration of this globe, or the general view of\r\nits operations, as a living world, maintaining plants and animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nSystem of Decay and Renovation observed in the Earth.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers observing an apparent disorder and confusion in the solid\r\nparts of this globe, have been led to conclude, that there formerly\r\nexisted a more regular and uniform state, in the constitution of this\r\nearth; that there had happened some destructive change; and that the\r\noriginal structure of the earth had been broken and disturbed by some\r\nviolent operation, whether natural, or from a super-natural cause. Now,\r\nall these appearances, from which conclusions of this kind have been\r\nformed, find the most perfect explanation in the theory which we have\r\nbeen endeavouring to establish; for they are the facts from whence we\r\nhave reasoned, in discovering the nature and constitution of this earth:\r\nTherefore, there is no occasion for having recourse to any unnatural\r\nsupposition of evil, to any destructive accident in nature, or to the\r\nagency of any preternatural cause, in explaining that which actually\r\nappears.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary for a living or inhabited world, that this should\r\nconsist of land and water. It is also necessary, that the land should be\r\nsolid and stable, refilling, with great power, the violent efforts\r\nof the ocean; and, at the same time, that this solid land should be\r\nresolved by the influence of the sun and atmosphere, so as to decay,\r\nand thus become a soil for vegetation. But these general intentions are\r\nperfectly fulfilled in the constitution of our earth, which has been now\r\ninvestigated. This great body being formed of different mixed masses,\r\nhaving various degrees of hardness and solubility, proper soil for\r\nplants is supplied from the gradual resolution of the solid parts;\r\nfertility in those soils arises from the mixture of different elementary\r\nsubstances; and stability is procured to that vegetable world, by the\r\ninduration of certain bodies, those rocks and stones, which protect the\r\nsofter masses of clay and soil.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, also, will easily be explained those natural appearances\r\nwhich diversify the surface of the earth for the use of plants and\r\nanimals, and those objects which beautify the face of nature for the\r\ncontemplation of mankind. Such are, the distinctions of mountains and\r\nvalleys, of lakes and rivers, of dry barren deserts and rich watered\r\nplains, of rocks which stand apparently unimpaired by the lapse of time,\r\nand sands which fluctuate with the winds and tides. All these are the\r\neffects of steady causes; each of these has its proper purpose in the\r\nsystem of the earth; and in that system is contained another, which is\r\nthat of living growing bodies, and of animated beings.\r\n\r\nBut, besides this, man, the intellectual being, has, in this subject of\r\nthe mineral kingdom, the means of gratifying the desire of knowledge, a\r\nfaculty by which he is distinguished from the animal, and by which he\r\nimproves his mind in knowing causes. Man is not satisfied, like the\r\nbrute, in seeing things which are; he seeks to know how things have\r\nbeen, and what they are to be. It is with pleasure that he observes\r\norder and regularity in the works of nature, instead of being disgusted\r\nwith disorder and confusion; and he is made happy from the appearance of\r\nwisdom and benevolence in the design, instead of being left to suspect\r\nin the Author of nature, any of that imperfection which he finds in\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nLet us now take a view of that system of mineral economy, in which may\r\nbe perceived every mark of order and design, of provident wisdom and\r\nbenevolence.\r\n\r\nWe have been endeavouring to prove, that all the continents and islands\r\nof this globe had been raised above the surface of the ocean; we have\r\nalso aimed at pointing out the cause of this translation of matter, as\r\nwell as of the general solidity of that which is raised to our view;\r\nbut however this theory shall be received, no person of observation can\r\nentertain a doubt, that all, or almost all we see of this earth, had\r\nbeen originally formed at the bottom of the sea. We have now another\r\nobject in our view; this is to investigate the operations of the globe,\r\nat the time that the foundation of this land was laying in the waters of\r\nthe ocean, and to trace the existence and the nature of things, before\r\nthe present land appeared above the surface of the waters. We should\r\nthus acquire some knowledge of the system according to which this world\r\nis ruled, both in its preservation and production; and we might be thus\r\nenabled to judge, how far the mineral system of the world shall appear\r\nto be contrived with all the wisdom, which is so manifest in what are\r\ntermed the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that this undertaking is a thing unreasonable\r\nin its nature; or that it is a work necessarily beset with any\r\nunsurmountable difficulty; for, however imperfectly we may fulfill this\r\nend proposed, yet, so far as it is to natural causes that are to be\r\nascribed the operations of former time, and so far as, from the present\r\nstate of things, or knowledge of natural history, we have it in our\r\npower to reason from effect to cause, there are, in the constitution of\r\nthe world, which we now examine, certain means to read the annals of a\r\nformer earth.\r\n\r\nThe object of inquiry being the operations of the globe, during the time\r\nthat the present earth was forming at the bottom of the sea, we are now\r\nto take a very general view of nature, without descending into those\r\nparticulars which so often occupy the speculations of naturalists, about\r\nthe present state of things. We are not at present to enter into any\r\ndiscussion with regard to what are the primary and secondary mountains\r\nof the earth; we are not to consider what is the first, and what the\r\nlast, in those things which now are seen; whatever is most ancient in\r\nthe strata which we now examine, is supposed to be collecting at the\r\nbottom of the sea, during the period concerning which we are now to\r\ninquire.\r\n\r\nWe have already considered those operations which had been necessary\r\nin forming our solid land, a body consisting of materials originally\r\ndeposited at the bottom of the ocean; we are now to investigate the\r\nsource from whence had come all those materials, from the collection of\r\nwhich the present land is formed; and from knowing the state in\r\nwhich those materials had existed, previously to their entering the\r\ncomposition of our strata, we shall learn something concerning the\r\nnatural history of this world, while the present earth was forming in\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nWe have already observed, that all the strata of the earth are composed\r\neither from the calcareous relicts of sea animals, or from the\r\ncollection of such materials as we find upon our shores. At a gross\r\ncomputation, there may perhaps be a fourth part of our solid land, which\r\nis composed from the matter that had belonged to those animals. Now,\r\nwhat a multitude of living creatures, what a quantity of animal economy\r\nmust have been required for producing a body of calcareous matter\r\nwhich is interspersed throughout all the land of the globe, and which\r\ncertainly forms a very considerable part of that mass! Therefore, in\r\nknowing how those animals had lived, or with what they had been fed, we\r\nshall have learned a most interesting part of the natural history of\r\nthis earth; a part which it is necessary to have ascertained, in order\r\nto see the former operations of the globe, while preparing the materials\r\nof the present land. But, before entering upon this subject, let us\r\nexamine the other materials of which our land is formed.\r\n\r\nGravel forms a part of those materials which compose our solid land; but\r\ngravel is no other than a collection of the fragments of solid stones\r\nworn round, or having their angular form destroyed by agitation in\r\nwater, and the attrition upon each other, or upon similar hard bodies.\r\nConsequently, in finding masses of gravel in the composition of our\r\nland, we must conclude, that there had existed a former land, on which\r\nthere had been transacted certain operations of wind and water, similar\r\nto those which are natural to the globe at present, and by which new\r\ngravel is continually prepared, as well as old gravel consumed or\r\ndiminished by attrition upon our shores.\r\n\r\nSand is the material which enters, perhaps in greatest quantity, the\r\ncomposition of our land. But sand, in general, is no other than small\r\nfragments of hard and solid bodies, worn or rounded more or less by\r\nattrition; consequently, the same natural history of the earth, which\r\nis investigated from the masses of gravel, is also applicable to those\r\nmasses of sand which we find forming so large a portion of our present\r\nland throughout all the earth[16].\r\n\r\n[Note 16: Sand is a term that denotes no particular substance; although\r\nby it is commonly meant a siliceous substance, as being by far the most\r\nprevalent. Sand is one of the modifications, of size and shape, in a\r\nhard body or solid substance, which may be infinitely diversified. The\r\nnext modification to be distinguished in mineral bodies is that of\r\ngravel; and this differs in no respect from sand, except in point of\r\nsize. Next after gravel, in the order of ascent, come stones; and these\r\nbear nearly the same relation to gravel as gravel does to sand. Now,\r\nby stones is to be understood the fragments of rocks or solid mineral\r\nbodies; and there is a perfect gradation from those stones to sand.\r\nI have already endeavoured to explain the formation of those stony\r\nsubstances; and now I am treating of a certain system of circulation,\r\nwhich is to be found among minerals.\r\n\r\nM. de Luc censures me for not giving the origin of sand, of which I form\r\nthe strata of the earth. He seems to have misunderstood my treatise. I\r\ndo not pretend, as he does in his theory, to describe the beginning of\r\nthings; I take things such as I find them at present, and from these\r\nI reason with regard to that which must have been. When, from a thing\r\nwhich is well known, we explain another which is less so, we then\r\ninvestigate nature; but when we imagine things without a pattern or\r\nexample in nature, then, instead of natural history, we write only\r\nfable.\r\n\r\nM. de Luc, in the letter already mentioned, says, \"that sand may be, and\r\nI think it is, a substance which has formed _strata_ by _precipitation\r\nin a liquid_.\" This is but an opinion, which may be either true or\r\nfalse. If it be true, it is an operation of the mineral kingdom of which\r\nI am ignorant. In all the sand which I have ever examined, I have never\r\nseen any that might not be referred to the species of mineral substance\r\nfrom which it had been formed. When this author shall have given us\r\nany kind of information with regard to the production of sand _by\r\nprecipitation in a liquid_, it will then be time enough to think of\r\nforming the strata of the earth with that sand.]\r\n\r\nClay is now to be considered as the last of those materials of which\r\nour strata are composed; but, in order to understand the nature of this\r\ningredient, something must be premised.\r\n\r\nClay is a mixture of different earths or hard substances, in an\r\nimpalpable state. Those substances are chiefly the siliceous and\r\naluminous earths. Other earths are occasionally mixed in clays, or\r\nperhaps always to be found in some small portion. But this does not\r\naffect the general character of clay; it only forms a special variety in\r\nthe subject. A sensible or considerable portion of calcareous earth, in\r\nthe composition of clay, constitutes a marl, and a sufficient admixture\r\nof sand, a loam.\r\n\r\nAn indefinite variety of those compositions of clay form a large portion\r\nof the present strata, all indurated and consolidated in various\r\ndegrees; but this great quantity of siliceous, argillaceous, and\r\nother compound substances, in form of earth or impalpable sediment,\r\ncorresponds perfectly with that quantity of those same substances which\r\nmust have been prepared in the formation of so much gravel and sand, by\r\nthe attrition of those bodies in the moving waters.\r\n\r\nTherefore, from the consideration of those materials which compose the\r\npresent land, we have reason to conclude, that, during the time this\r\nland was forming, by the collection of its materials at the bottom of\r\nthe sea, there had been a former land containing materials similar to\r\nthose which we find at present in examining the earth. We may also\r\nconclude, that there had been operations similar to those which we\r\nnow find natural to the globe, and necessarily exerted in the actual\r\nformation of gravel, sand, and clay. But what we have now chiefly in\r\nview to illustrate is this, that there had then been in the ocean a\r\nsystem of animated beings, which propagated their species, and which\r\nhave thus continued their several races to this day.\r\n\r\nIn order to be convinced of that truth, we have but to examine the\r\nstrata of our earth, in which we find the remains of animals. In this\r\nexamination, we not only discover every genus of animal which at present\r\nexists in the sea, but probably every species, and perhaps some species\r\nwith which at present we are not acquainted. There are, indeed,\r\nvarieties in those species, compared with the present animals which we\r\nexamine, but no greater varieties than may perhaps be found among the\r\nsame species in the different quarters of the globe. Therefore, the\r\nsystem of animal life, which had been maintained in the ancient sea, had\r\nnot been different from that which now subsists, and of which it belongs\r\nto naturalists to know the history.\r\n\r\nIt is the nature of animal life to be ultimately supported from matter\r\nof vegetable production. Inflammable matter may be considered as the\r\n_pabulum_ of life. This is prepared in the bodies of living plants,\r\nparticularly in their leaves exposed to the sun and light. This\r\ninflammable matter, on the contrary, is consumed in animal bodies, where\r\nit produces heat or light, or both. Therefore, however animal matter, or\r\nthe pabulum of life, may circulate through a series of digesting powers,\r\nit is constantly impaired or diminishing in the course of this economy,\r\nand, without the productive power of plants, it would finally be\r\nextinguished.[17]\r\n\r\n[Note 17: See Dissertations on different subjects of Natural Philosophy,\r\npart II.]\r\n\r\nThe animals of the former world must have been sustained during\r\nindefinite successions of ages. The mean quantity of animal matter,\r\ntherefore, must have been preserved by vegetable production, and the\r\nnatural waste of inflammable substance repaired with continual addition;\r\nthat is to say, the quantity of inflammable matter necessary to the\r\nanimal consumption, must have been provided by means of vegetation.\r\nHence we must conclude, that there had been a world of plants, as well\r\nas an ocean replenished with living animals.\r\n\r\nWe are now, in reasoning from principles, come to a point decisive of\r\nthe question, and which will either confirm the theory, if it be just,\r\nor confute our reasoning, if we have erred. Let us, therefore, open\r\nthe book of Nature, and read in her records, if there had been a world\r\nbearing plants, at the time when this present world was forming at the\r\nbottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nHere the cabinets of the curious are to be examined; but here some\r\ncaution is required, in order to distinguish things perfectly different,\r\nwhich sometimes are confounded.\r\n\r\nFossil wood, to naturalists in general, is wood dug up from under\r\nground, without inquiring whether this had been the production of the\r\npresent earth, or that which had preceded it in the circulation of land\r\nand water. The question is important, and the solution of it is, in\r\ngeneral, easy. The vegetable productions of the present earth, however\r\ndeep they may be found buried beneath its surface, and however ancient\r\nthey may appear, compared with the records of our known times, are new,\r\ncompared with the solid land on which they grew; and they are only\r\ncovered with the produce of a vegetable soil, or the alluvion of the\r\npresent land on which we dwell, and on which they had grown. But the\r\nfossil bodies which form the present subject of inquiry, belonged to\r\nformer land, and are found only in the sea-born strata of our present\r\nearth. It is to these alone that we appeal, in order to prove the\r\ncertainty of former events.\r\n\r\nMineralised wood, therefore, is the object now inquired after; that wood\r\nwhich had been lodged in the bottom of the sea, and there composed part\r\nof a stratum, which hitherto we have considered as only formed of the\r\nmaterials proper to the ocean. Now, what a profusion of this species of\r\nfossil wood is to be found in the cabinets of collectors, and even in\r\nthe hands of lapidaries, and such artificers of polished stones! In some\r\nplaces, it would seem to be as common as the agate.\r\n\r\nI shall only mention a specimen in my own collection. It is wood\r\npetrified with calcareous earth, and mineralised with pyrites. This\r\nspecimen of wood contains in itself, even without the stratum of stone\r\nin which it is embedded, the most perfect record of its genealogy.\r\nIt had been eaten or perforated by those sea worms which destroy the\r\nbottoms of our ships. There is the clearest evidence of this truth.\r\nTherefore, this wood had grown upon land which flood above the level of\r\nsea, while the present land was only forming at the bottom of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWood is the most substantial part of plants, as shells are the more\r\npermanent part of marine animals. It is not, however, the woody part\r\nalone of the ancient vegetable world that is transmitted to us in\r\nthe record of our mineral pages. We have the type of many species\r\nof foliage, and even of the most delicate flower; for, in this way,\r\nnaturalists have determined, according to the Linnaean system, the\r\nspecies, or at least the genus, of the plant. Thus, the existence of a\r\nvegetable system at the period now in contemplation, so far from being\r\ndoubtful, is a matter of physical demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe profusion of this vegetable matter, delivered into the ocean, which\r\nthen generated land, is also evidenced in the amazing quantities of\r\nmineral coal which is to be found in perhaps every region of the earth.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more certain, than that all the coaly or bituminous\r\nstrata have had their origin from the substance of vegetable bodies\r\nthat grew upon the land. Those strata, tho', in general, perfectly\r\nconsolidated, often separate horizontally in certain places; and there\r\nwe find the fibrous or vascular structure of the vegetable bodies.\r\nConsequently, there is no doubt of fossil coal being a substance\r\nof vegetable production, however animal substances also may have\r\ncontributed in forming this collection of oleaginous or inflammable\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nHaving thus ascertained the state of a former earth, in which plants\r\nand animals had lived, as well as the gradual production of the present\r\nearth, composed from the materials of a former world, it must be\r\nevident, that here are two operations which are necessarily consecutive.\r\nThe formation of the present earth necessarily involves the destruction\r\nof continents in the ancient world; and, by pursuing in our mind the\r\nnatural operations of a former earth, we clearly see the origin of that\r\nland, by the fertility of which, we, and all the animated bodies of the\r\nsea, are fed. It is in like manner, that, contemplating the present\r\noperations of the globe, we may perceive the actual existence of those\r\nproductive causes, which are now laying the foundation of land in the\r\nunfathomable regions of the sea, and which will, in time, give birth to\r\nfuture continents.\r\n\r\nBut though, in generalising the operations of nature, we have arrived at\r\nthose great events, which, at first sight, may fill the mind with\r\nwonder and with doubt, we are not to suppose, that there is any violent\r\nexertion of power, such as is required in order to produce a great event\r\nin little time; in nature, we find no deficiency in respect of time, nor\r\nany limitation with regard to power. But time is not made to flow in\r\nvain; nor does there ever appear the exertion of superfluous power, or\r\nthe manifestation of design, not calculated in wisdom to effect some\r\ngeneral end.\r\n\r\nThe events now under consideration may be examined with a view to see\r\nthis truth; for it may be inquired, Why destroy one continent in order\r\nto erect another? The answer is plain; Nature does not destroy a\r\ncontinent from having wearied of a subject which had given pleasure, or\r\nchanged her purpose, whether for a better or a worse; neither does she\r\nerect a continent of land among the clouds, to show her power, or to\r\namaze the vulgar man; Nature has contrived the productions of vegetable\r\nbodies, and the sustenance of animal life, to depend upon the gradual\r\nbut sure destruction of a continent; that is to say, these two\r\noperations necessarily go hand in hand. But with such wisdom has nature\r\nordered things in the economy of this world, that the destruction of one\r\ncontinent is not brought about without the renovation of the earth in\r\nthe production of another; and the animal and vegetable bodies, for\r\nwhich the world above the surface of the sea is leveled with its bottom,\r\nare among the means employed in those operations, as well as the\r\nsustenance of those living beings is the proper end in view.\r\n\r\nThus, in understanding the proper constitution of the present earth, we\r\nare led to know the source from whence had come all the materials which\r\nnature had employed in the construction of the world which appears; a\r\nworld contrived in consummate wisdom for the growth and habitation of a\r\ngreat diversity of plants and animals; and a world peculiarly adapted\r\nto the purposes of man, who inhabits all its climates, who measures its\r\nextent, and determines its productions at his pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe whole of a great object or event fills us with wonder and\r\nastonishment, when all the particulars, in the succession of which the\r\nwhole had been produced, may be considered without the least emotion.\r\nWhen, for example, we behold the pyramids of Egypt, our mind is agitated\r\nwith a crowd of ideas that highly entertains the person who understands\r\nthe subject; but the carrying a heavy stone up to the top of a hill or\r\nmountain would give that person little pleasure or concern. We wonder at\r\nthe whole operation of the pyramid, but not at any one particular part.\r\n\r\nThe raising up of a continent of land from the bottom of the sea, is an\r\nidea that is too great to be conceived easily in all the parts of its\r\noperations, many of which are perhaps unknown to us; and, without being\r\nproperly understood, so great an idea may appear like a thing that is\r\nimaginary. In like manner, the co-relative, or corresponding operation,\r\nthe destruction of the land, is an idea that does not easily enter into\r\nthe mind of man in its totality, although he is daily witness to part of\r\nthe operation. We never see a river in a flood, but we must acknowledge\r\nthe carrying away of part of our land, to be sunk at the bottom of the\r\nsea; we never see a storm upon the coast, but we are informed of a\r\nhostile attack of the sea upon our country; attacks which must, in time,\r\nwear away the bulwarks of our soil, and sap the foundations of our\r\ndwellings. Thus, great things are not understood without the analysing\r\nof many operations, and the combination of time with many events\r\nhappening in succession.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider what is to be the subject of examination, and where\r\nit is that we are to observe those operations which must determine\r\neither the stability or the instability of this land on which we live.\r\n\r\nOur land has two extremities; the tops of the mountains, on the one\r\nhand, and the sea-shores, on the other: It is the intermediate space\r\nbetween these two, that forms the habitation of plants and animals.\r\nWhile there is a sea-shore and a higher ground there is that which is\r\nrequired in the system of the world: Take these away, and there would\r\nremain an aqueous globe, in which the world would perish. But, in the\r\nnatural operations of the world, the land is perishing continually; and\r\nthis is that which now we want to understand.\r\n\r\nUpon the one extremity of our land, there is no increase, or there is no\r\naccession of any mineral substance. That place is the mountain-top, on\r\nwhich nothing is observed but continual decay. The fragments of the\r\nmountain are removed in a gradual succession from the highest station to\r\nthe lowest. Being arrived at the shore, and having entered the dominion\r\nof the waves, in which they find perpetual agitation, these hard\r\nfragments, which had eluded the resolving powers natural to the surface\r\nof the earth, are incapable of resisting the powers here employed for\r\nthe destruction of the land. By the attrition of one hard body upon\r\nanother, the moving stones and rocky shore, are mutually impaired. And\r\nthat solid mass, which of itself had potential liability against the\r\nviolence of the waves, affords the instruments of its own destruction,\r\nand thus gives occasion to its actual instability.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the system of the heavens, it is necessary to\r\nconnect together periods of measured time, and the distinguished places\r\nof revolving bodies. It is thus that system may be observed, or wisdom,\r\nin the proper adapting of powers to an intention. In like manner, we\r\ncannot understand the system of the globe, without seeing that progress\r\nof things which is brought about in time, thus measuring the natural\r\noperations of the earth with those of the heavens. This is properly the\r\nbusiness of the present undertaking.\r\n\r\nOur object is to know the time which had elapsed since the foundation of\r\nthe present continent had been laid at the bottom of the ocean, to the\r\npresent moment in which we speculate on these operations. The space is\r\nlong; the data for the calculations are, perhaps, deficient: No matter;\r\nso far as we know our error, or the deficiency in our operation, we\r\nproceed in science, and shall conclude in reason. It is not given to man\r\nto know what things are truly in themselves, but only what those things\r\nare in his thought. We seek not to know the precise measure of any\r\nthing; we only understand the limits of a thing, in knowing what it is\r\nnot, either on the one side or the other.\r\n\r\nWe are investigating the age of the present earth, from the beginning of\r\nthat body which was in the bottom of the sea, to the perfection of its\r\nnature, which we consider as in the moment of our existence; and we have\r\nnecessarily another aera, which is collateral, or correspondent, in the\r\nprogress of those natural events. This is the time required, in the\r\nnatural operations of this globe, for the destruction of a former\r\nearth; an earth equally perfect with the present and an earth equally\r\nproductive of growing plants and living animals. Now, it must appear,\r\nthat, if we had a measure for the one of those corresponding operations,\r\nwe would have an equal knowledge of the other.\r\n\r\nThe formation of a future earth being in the bottom of the ocean, at\r\ndepths unfathomable to man, and in regions far beyond the reach of his\r\nobservation, here is a part of the process which cannot be taken as a\r\nprinciple in forming an estimate of the whole. But, in the destruction\r\nof the present earth, we have a process that is performed within the\r\nlimits of our observation; therefore, in knowing the measure of this\r\noperation, we shall find the means of calculating what had passed on a\r\nformer occasion, as well as what will happen in the composition of a\r\nfuture earth. Let us, therefore, now attempt to make this estimate of\r\ntime and labour.\r\n\r\nThe highest mountain may be levelled with the plain from whence it\r\nsprings, without the loss of real territory in the land; but when the\r\nocean makes encroachment on the basis of our earth, the mountain,\r\nunsupported, tumbles with its weight; and with the accession of hard\r\nbodies, moveable with the agitation of the waves, gives to the sea the\r\npower of undermining farther and farther into the solid basis of our\r\nland. This is the operation which is to be measured; this is the mean\r\nproportional by which we are to estimate the age of worlds that have\r\nterminated, and the duration of those that are but beginning.\r\n\r\nBut how shall we measure the decrease of our land? Every revolution of\r\nthe globe wears away some part of some rock upon some coast; but the\r\nquantity of that decrease, in that measured time, is not a measurable\r\nthing. Instead of a revolution of the globe, let us take an age. The age\r\nof man does no more in this estimate than a single year. He sees,\r\nthat the natural course of things is to wear away the coast, with the\r\nattrition of the sand and stones upon the shore; but he cannot find a\r\nmeasure for this quantity which shall correspond to time, in order to\r\nform an estimate of the rate of this decrease.\r\n\r\nBut man is not confined to what he sees; he has the experience of former\r\nmen. Let us then go to the Romans and the Greeks in search of a measure\r\nof our coasts, which we may compare with the present state of things.\r\nHere, again, we are disappointed; their descriptions of the shores of\r\nGreece and of Italy, and their works upon the coast, either give no\r\nmeasure of a decrease, or are not accurate enough for such a purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is in vain to attempt to measure a quantity which escapes our notice,\r\nand which history cannot ascertain; and we might just as well attempt to\r\nmeasure the distance of the stars without a parallax, as to calculate\r\nthe destruction of the solid land without a measure corresponding to the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nThe description which Polybius has given of the Pontus Euxinus, with\r\nthe two opposite Bosphori, the Meotis, the Propontis, and the Port of\r\nByzantium, are as applicable to the present state of things as they were\r\nat the writing of that history. The filling up of the bed of the\r\nMeotis, an event which, to Polybius, appeared not far off, must also be\r\nconsidered as removed to a very distant period, though the causes still\r\ncontinue to operate as before.\r\n\r\nBut there is a thing in which history and the present state of things do\r\nnot agree. It is upon the coast of Spain, where Polybius says there was\r\nan island in the mouth of the harbour of New Carthage. At present, in\r\nplace of the island, there is only a rock under the surface of the\r\nwater. It must be evident, however, that the loss of this small island\r\naffords no proper ground of calculation for the measure or rate of\r\nwasting which could correspond to the coast in general; as neither\r\nthe quantity of what is now lost had been measured, nor its quality\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nLet us examine places much more exposed to the fury of the waves and\r\ncurrents than the coast of Carthagena, the narrow fretum, for example,\r\nbetween Italy and Sicily. It does not appear, that this passage is\r\nsensibly wider than when the Romans first had known it. The Isthmus of\r\nCorinth is also apparently the same at present as it had been two or\r\nthree thousand years ago. Scilla and Charibdis remain now, as they had\r\nbeen in ancient times, rocks hazardous for coasting vessels which had to\r\npass that strait.\r\n\r\nIt is not meant by this to say, these rocks have not been wasted by the\r\nsea, and worn by the attrition of moving bodies, during that space of\r\ntime; were this true, and that those rocks, the bulwarks of the land\r\nupon those coasts, had not been at all impaired from that period, they\r\nmight remain for ever, and thus the system of interchanging the place of\r\nsea and land upon this globe might be frustrated. It is only meant\r\nto affirm, that the quantity which those rocks, or that coast, have\r\ndiminished from the period of our history, has either been too small\r\na thing for human observation, or, which is more probable, that no\r\naccurate measurement of the subject, by which this quantity of decrease\r\nmight have been ascertained, had been taken and recorded. It must be\r\nalso evident, that a very small operation of an earthquake would be\r\nsufficient to render every means of information, in this manner of\r\nmensuration, unsatisfactory or precarious.\r\n\r\nPliny says Italy was distant from Sicily a mile and a half; but we\r\ncannot suppose that this measure was taken any otherwise than by\r\ncomputation, and such a measure is but little calculated to afford us\r\nthe just means of a comparison with the present distance. He also says,\r\nindeed, that Sicily had been once joined with Italy. His words are:\r\n\"Quondam Brutio agro cohaerens, mox interfuso mari avulsa.[18]\" But all\r\nthat we can conclude from this history of Pliny is, that, in all times,\r\nto people considering the appearances of those two approached coasts,\r\nit had seemed probable, that the sea formed a passage between the two\r\ncountries which had been once united; in like manner as is still more\r\nimmediately perceived, in that smaller disjunction which is made between\r\nthe island of Anglesey and the continent of Wales.\r\n\r\n[Note 18: Lib. 3. cap. 8.]\r\n\r\nThe port of Syracuse, with the island which forms the greater and\r\nlesser, and the fountain of Arethusa, the water of which the ancients\r\ndivided from the sea with a wall, do not seem to be altered. From Sicily\r\nto the coast of Egypt, there is an uninterrupted course of sea for a\r\nthousand miles; consequently, the wind, in such a stretch of sea, should\r\nbring powerful waves against those coasts: But, on this coast of Egypt,\r\nwe find the rock on which was formerly built the famous tower of Pharos;\r\nand also, at the eastern extremity of the port Eunoste, the sea-bath,\r\ncut in the solid rock upon the shore. Both those rocks, buffeted\r\nimmediately with the waves of the Mediterranean sea, are, to all\r\nappearance, the same at this day as they were in ancient times.[19]\r\n\r\n[Note 19: Lettres sur l'Egypte, M. Savary.]\r\n\r\nMany other such proofs will certainly occur, where the different parts\r\nof those coasts are examined by people of observation and intelligence.\r\nBut it is enough for our present purpose, that this decrease of the\r\ncoasts in general has not been observed; and that it is as generally\r\nthought, that the land is gaining upon the sea, as that the sea is\r\ngaining upon the land.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the argument, we are certain, that all the coasts of the\r\npresent continents are wasted by the sea, and constantly wearing away\r\nupon the whole; but this operation is so extremely slow, that we cannot\r\nfind a measure of the quantity in order to form an estimate: Therefore,\r\nthe present continents of the earth, which we consider as in a state of\r\nperfection, would, in the natural operations of the globe, require a\r\ntime indefinite for their destruction.\r\n\r\nBut, in order to produce the present continents, the destruction of a\r\nformer vegetable world was necessary; consequently, the production of\r\nour present continents must have required a time which is indefinite.\r\nIn like manner, if the former continents were of the same nature as the\r\npresent, it must have required another space of time, which also is\r\nindefinite, before they had come to their perfection as a vegetable\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWe have been representing the system of this earth as proceeding with\r\na certain regularity, which is not perhaps in nature, but which is\r\nnecessary for our clear conception of the system of nature. The\r\nsystem of nature is certainly in rule, although we may not know every\r\ncircumstance of its regulation. We are under a necessity, therefore, of\r\nmaking regular suppositions, in order to come at certain conclusions\r\nwhich may be compared with the present state of things.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that the present land should be worn away and\r\nwasted, exactly in proportion as new land shall appear; or, conversely,\r\nthat an equal proportion of new land should always be produced as the\r\nold is made to disappear. It is only required, that at all times, there\r\nshould be a just proportion of land and water upon the surface of the\r\nglobe, for the purpose of a habitable world.\r\n\r\nNeither is it required in the actual system of this earth, that every\r\npart of the land should be dissolved in its structure, and worn away by\r\nattrition, so as to be floated in the sea. Parts of the land may often\r\nsink in a body below the level of the sea, and parts again may be\r\nrestored, without waiting for the general circulation of land and water,\r\nwhich proceeds with all the certainty of nature, but which advances with\r\nan imperceptible progression. Many of such apparent irregularities may\r\nappear without the least infringement on the general system. That system\r\nis comprehended in the preparation of future land at the bottom of the\r\nocean, from those materials which the dissolution and attrition of\r\nthe present land may have provided, and from those which the natural\r\noperations of the sea afford.\r\n\r\nIn thus accomplishing a certain end, we are not to limit nature with the\r\nuniformity of an equable progression, although it be necessary in our\r\ncomputations to proceed upon equalities. Thus also, in the use of means,\r\nwe are not to prescribe to nature those alone which we think suitable\r\nfor the purpose, in our narrow view. It is our business to learn of\r\nnature (that is by observation) the ways and means, which in her wisdom\r\nare adopted; and we are to imagine these only in order to find means for\r\nfurther information, and to increase our knowledge from the examination\r\nof things which actually have been. It is in this manner, that intention\r\nmay be found in nature; but this intention is not to be supposed, or\r\nvainly imagined, from what we may conceive to be.\r\n\r\nWe have been now supposing, that the beginning of our present earth had\r\nbeen laid in the bottom of the ocean, at the completion of the former\r\nland; but this was only for the sake of distinctness. The just view is\r\nthis, that when the former land of the globe had been complete, so as\r\nto begin to waste and be impaired by the encroachment of the sea, the\r\npresent land began to appear above the surface of the ocean. In this\r\nmanner we suppose a due proportion to be always preserved of land and\r\nwater upon the surface of the globe, for the purpose of a habitable\r\nworld, such as this which we possess. We thus, also, allow time and\r\nopportunity for the translation of animals and plants to occupy the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nBut, if the earth on which we live, began to appear in the ocean at\r\nthe time when the last began to be resolved, it could not be from the\r\nmaterials of the continent immediately preceding this which we examine,\r\nthat the present earth had been constructed; for the bottom of the ocean\r\nmust have been filled with materials before land could be made to appear\r\nabove its surface.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that the continent, which is to succeed our land, is at\r\npresent beginning to appear above the water in the middle of the Pacific\r\nOcean, it must be evident, that the materials of this great body, which\r\nis formed and ready to be brought forth, must have been collected from\r\nthe destruction of an earth, which does not now appear. Consequently,\r\nin this true statement of the case, there is necessarily required the\r\ndestruction of an animal and vegetable earth prior to the former land;\r\nand the materials of that earth which is first in our account, must have\r\nbeen collected at the bottom of the ocean, and begun to be concocted for\r\nthe production of the present earth, when the land immediately preceding\r\nthe present had arrived at its full extent.\r\n\r\nThis, however, alters nothing with regard to the nature of those\r\noperations of the globe. The system is still the same. It only protracts\r\nthe indefinite space of time in its existence, while it gives us a view\r\nof another distinct period of the living world; that is to say, the\r\nworld which we inhabit is composed of the materials, not of the earth\r\nwhich was the immediate predecessor of the present, but of the earth\r\nwhich, in ascending from the present, we consider as the third, and\r\nwhich had preceded the land that was above the surface of the sea, while\r\nour present land was yet beneath the water of the ocean. Here are three\r\ndistinct successive periods of existence, and each of these is, in our\r\nmeasurement of time, a thing of indefinite duration.\r\n\r\nWe have now got to the end of our reasoning; we have no data further\r\nto conclude immediately from that which actually is: But we have got\r\nenough; we have the satisfaction to find, that in nature there is\r\nwisdom, system, and consistency. For having, in the natural history of\r\nthis earth, seen a succession of worlds, we may from this conclude that\r\nthere is a system in nature; in like manner as, from seeing revolutions\r\nof the planets, it is concluded, that there is a system by which they\r\nare intended to continue those revolutions. But if the succession of\r\nworlds is established in the system of nature, it is in vain to look for\r\nany thing higher in the origin of the earth. The result, therefore, of\r\nthis physical inquiry is, that we find no vestige of a beginning,--no\r\nprospect of an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nAn Examination of Mr KIRWAN'S Objections to the Igneous Origin of Stony\r\nSubstances.\r\n\r\nA theory which is founded on a new principle, a theory which has to make\r\nits way in the public mind by overturning the opinions commonly received\r\nby philosophising men, and one which has nothing to recommend it but the\r\ntruth of its principles, and the view of wisdom or design to which it\r\nleads, neither of which may perhaps be perceived by the generality of\r\npeople, such a theory, I say, must meet with the strongest opposition\r\nfrom the prejudices of the learned, and from the superstition of those\r\nwho judge not for themselves in forming their notions, but look up to\r\nmen of science for authority. Such is the case with some part of the\r\nTheory of the Earth, which I have given, and which will probably give\r\noffence to naturalists who have espoused an opposite opinion. In order,\r\nthen, to obtain the approbation of the public, it may not be enough to\r\ngive a theory that should be true, or altogether unexceptionable it may\r\nbe necessary to defend every point that shall be thought exceptionable\r\nby other theorists, and to show the fallacy of every learned objection\r\nthat may be made against it. It is thus, in general, that truth and\r\nerror are forced to struggle together, in the progress of science; and\r\nit is only in proportion as science removes erroneous conceptions, which\r\nare necessarily in the constitution of human knowledge, that truth will\r\nfind itself established in natural philosophy.\r\n\r\nMr Kirwan has written a dissertation, entitled, _Examination of the\r\nSupposed Igneous Origin of Stony Substances_, which was read in the\r\nRoyal Irish Academy. The object of that dissertation is to state certain\r\nobjections, which have occurred to him, against the Theory of the Earth\r\npublished in the Transactions of the Edinburgh Royal Society; and he has\r\nattacked that theory in all the points where it appears to him to be\r\nvulnerable. It is to these objections that I am now to give an answer.\r\nThe authority given to this dissertation, by the Royal Irish Academy,\r\nas well as the reputation of the author, make it necessary for me\r\nto endeavour to put in their true light the facts alleged in that\r\nperformance, and to analyse the arguments employed, in order to judge of\r\nthe reasoning by which the theory of mineral fusion is refuted in this\r\nExamination.\r\n\r\nA theory founded on truth, and formed according to the proper rules of\r\nscience, can ever suffer from a strict examination, by which it would\r\nbe but the more and more confirmed. But, where causes are to be traced\r\nthrough a chain of various complicated effects, an examination not\r\nproperly conducted upon accurate analytical principles, instead of\r\ngiving light upon a subject in which there had been obscurity and doubt,\r\nmay only serve to perplex the understanding, and bring confusion into a\r\nsubject which was before sufficiently distinct. To redress that evil,\r\nthen, must require more labour and some address; and this is an\r\ninconveniency that may be looked for, more or less, in every\r\ncontroversial discussion.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to enter any farther into the defence of my theory in\r\nthis chapter, than what is necessary to answer a man of science and\r\nrespectability, who has stated his objections. The observations which\r\nhe has made appear to me to be founded on nothing more than common\r\nprejudice, and misconceived notions of the subject. I am therefore\r\nto point out that erroneous train of reasoning, into which a hasty\r\nsuperficial view of things, perhaps, has led the patron of an opposite\r\nopinion to see my theory in an unfavourable light. This, however, is not\r\nall; for, that train of inconsequential reasoning is so congenial with\r\nthe crude and inconsiderate notion generally entertained, of solid\r\nmineral bodies having been formed by the infiltration of water into\r\nthe earth, that no opportunity should be lost of exposing an erroneous\r\nmanner of reasoning, which is employed in supporting a hypothesis\r\nfounded upon certain operations of the surface of this earth that cannot\r\nbe properly applied to the formation of mineral bodies. This object,\r\ntherefore, so far as it may come in the way, will be attended to in\r\nthis discussion, although I shall have another opportunity of farther\r\nenlarging upon that subject.\r\n\r\nOur author begins by examining a geological operation, the very opposite\r\nto that of mineral consolidation, and which would seem to have little\r\nconnection with the subject of this dissertation. In my theory, I\r\nadvanced two propositions with regard to the economy of this world:\r\nFirst, That the solid masses of this earth, when exposed to the\r\natmosphere, decay, and are resolved into loose materials, of which the\r\nvegetable soil upon the surface is in part composed; and, secondly, That\r\nthese loose materials are washed away by the currents of water, and\r\nthus carried at last into the sea. Our author says \"Here are two\r\nsuppositions, neither of which is grounded on facts;\" and yet he has\r\nbut the moment before made the following confession: \"That the soil,\r\nhowever, receives an increase from some species of stones that moulder\r\nby exposition to the air cannot be denied, but there is no proof that\r\nall soil has arisen from decomposition.\"--Surely _all soil_, that\r\nis made from the _hard and compact_ body of the land, which is my\r\nproposition, must have arisen from _decomposition_; and I have no where\r\nsaid, that _all_ the soil of this earth is made from the decomposition\r\nor detritus of those stony substances; for, masses of looser sand and\r\nsofter substances contribute still more to the formation of vegetable\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the other proposition, our author says, \"Soil is not\r\nconstantly carried away by the water, even from mountains.\"--I have not\r\nsaid that it is _constantly_ washed away; for, while it is soil in which\r\nplants grow, it is not travelling to the sea, although it be on the road,\r\nand must there arrive in time. I have said, that it is _necessarily_\r\nwashed away, that is, occasionally. M. de Luc's authority is then\r\nreferred to, as refuting this operation of water and time upon the soil.\r\nNow, I cannot help here observing, that our author seems to have as\r\nmuch misapprehended M. de Luc's argument as he has done mine. That\r\nphilosopher, in his letters to the Queen, has described most accurately\r\nthe decay of the rocks and solid mountains of the Alps and Jura, and the\r\ntravelling of their materials by water, although he does not carry them\r\nto the sea. It is true, indeed, that this author, who supposes the\r\npresent earth on which we dwell very young, is anxious to make an earth,\r\n_in time_, that shall not decay nor be washed away at all; but that time\r\nis not come yet; therefore the authority, here given against my\r\ntheory, is the speculative supposition, or mere opinion, of a natural\r\nphilosopher, with regard to an event which may never come to pass, and\r\nwhich I shall have occasion to consider fully in another place.\r\n\r\nOur author had just now said, that I have advanced two suppositions,\r\n_neither of which is grounded on facts_: Now, with regard to the one, he\r\nhas acknowledged, that the mouldering of stones takes place, which is\r\nthe fact on which that proposition is grounded; and with regard to the\r\nother, the only authority given against it is founded expressly upon\r\nthe moving of soil by means of the rain water, in order to make sloping\r\nplains of mountains. Here, therefore, I have grounded my propositions\r\nupon facts; and our author has founded his objections, first, upon a\r\ndifficulty which he has himself removed; and, secondly, upon nothing but\r\na visionary opinion, with regard to an earth which is not yet made, and\r\nwhich, when once made, is never more to change.\r\n\r\nAfter making some unimportant observations,--of all water not flowing\r\ninto the sea,--and of the travelled materials being also deposited upon\r\nthe plains, etc. our author thus proceeds: \"Hence the conclusion of our\r\nauthor relative to the imperfect constitution of the globe falls to the\r\nground; and the pains he takes to learn, _by what means a decayed world\r\nmay be renovated_, are superfluous.\"--The object of my theory is\r\nto show, that this decaying nature of the solid earth is the very\r\n_perfection_ of its constitution, as a living world; therefore, it\r\nwas most proper that I should _take pains to learn_ by what means the\r\ndecayed parts might be renovated. It is true, indeed, that this will be\r\nsuperfluous, when once that constitution of the earth, which M. de Luc\r\nthinks is preparing, shall be finished; but, in the mean time, while\r\nrivers carry the materials of our land, and while the sea impairs the\r\ncoast, I may be allowed to suppose that this is the actual constitution\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nI cannot help here animadverting upon what seems to be our author's\r\nplan, in making these objections, which have nothing to do with his\r\nexamination. He accuses me of giving this world a false or imperfect\r\nconstitution, (in which the solid land is considered as resolvable, and\r\nthe materials of that land as being washed away into the sea,) for no\r\nother reason, that I can see, but because this may imply the formation\r\nof a future earth, which he is not disposed to allow; and, he is now to\r\ndeny the stratified construction of this present earth to have been made\r\nby the deposits of materials at the bottom of the sea, because that\r\nwould prove the existence of a former earth, which is repugnant to his\r\nnotion of the origin of things, and is contrary, as he says, to reason,\r\nand the tenor of the Mosaic history. Let me observe, in passing, that M.\r\nde Luc, of whose opinions our author expresses much approbation, thinks\r\nthat he proves, from the express words and tenor of the Mosaic history,\r\nthat the present earth was at the bottom of the sea not many years ago,\r\nand that the former earth had then disappeared.\r\n\r\nBut, what does our author propose to himself, in refusing to admit my\r\nview of the operations which are daily transacting upon the surface of\r\nthis earth, where there is nothing dark or in the least mysterious, as\r\nthere may be in the mineral regions? Does he mean to say, that it is not\r\nthe purpose of this world to provide soil for plants to grow in? Does\r\nhe suppose that this soil is not moveable with the running water of the\r\nsurface? and, Does he think that it is not necessary to replace that\r\nsoil which is removed? This is all that I required in that constitution\r\nof the world which he has thus attacked; and I wish that he or any\r\nperson would point out, in what respect I had demanded any thing\r\nunreasonable, or any thing that is not actually to be observed every\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThus I have endeavoured to show, that our author has attacked my theory\r\nin a part where I believe it must be thought invulnerable; but this is\r\nonly, I presume, in order that he may make an attack with more advantage\r\nupon another part, viz. the composition of strata from the materials of\r\nan earth thus worn out in the service of vegetation,--materials which\r\nare necessarily removed in order to make way for that change of things\r\nin which consists the active and living system of this world. If he\r\nsucceed in this attempt to refute my theory of the original formation\r\nof strata, he would then doubtless find it more easy to persuade\r\nphilosophers that the means which I employ in bringing those materials\r\nagain to light, when transformed into such solid masses as the system of\r\nthis earth requires, are extravagant, unnatural, and unnecessary. Let us\r\nthen see how he sets about this undertaking.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the composition of the earth, it is quoted from my\r\ntheory, that _the solid parts of the globe are in general composed\r\nof sand, gravel, argillaceous and calcareous strata, or of various\r\ncompositions of these with other substances_; our author then adds,\r\n\"This certainly cannot be affirmed as a fact, but rather the contrary;\r\nit holds only true of the surface, the basis of the greater part of\r\nScotland is evidently a granitic rock, to say nothing of the continents,\r\nboth of the Old and New World, according to the testimony of all\r\nmineralogists.\" This proposition, with regard to the general composition\r\nof the earth, I have certainly not assumed, I have maintained it as a\r\nfact, after the most scrupulous examination of all that, with the most\r\ndiligent search, I have been able to see, and of all that authors\r\nhave wrote intelligibly upon the subject. If, therefore, I have so\r\nmisrepresented this great geological fact on which my theory is\r\nabsolutely founded, I must have erred with open eyes; and my theory\r\nof the earth, like others which have gone before it, will, upon close\r\nexamination, appear to be unfounded, as the dissertation now before us\r\nis endeavouring to represent it.\r\n\r\nOur author here, I think, alleges that the contrary to this, my\r\nfundamental proposition, is the truth; and he has given us Scotland as\r\nan example in which his assertion (founded upon the testimony of all\r\nmineralogists), is illustrated. Now my geological proposition should\r\ncertainly be applicable to Scotland, which is the country that I ought\r\nto be best acquainted with; consequently, if what our author here\r\nasserts be true, I would have deserved that blame which he is willing to\r\nthrow on me. Let me then beg the readers attention for a moment, that I\r\nmay justify myself from that charge, and place in its proper light this\r\nauthority, upon so material a point in geology.\r\n\r\nI had examined Scotland from the one end to the other before I saw one\r\nstone of granite in its native place, I have moreover examined almost\r\nall England and Wales, (excepting Devonshire and Cornwall) without\r\nseeing more of granite than one spot, not many hundred yards of extent;\r\nthis is at Chap; and I know, from information, that there is another\r\nsmall spot in the middle of England where it is just seen. But, let me\r\nbe more particular with regard to Scotland, the example given in proof.\r\n\r\nI had travelled every road from the borders of Northumberland and\r\nWestmoreland to Edinburgh; from Edinburgh, I had travelled to\r\nPort-Patrick, and from that along the coast of Galloway and Airshire\r\nto Inverary in Argyleshire, and I had examined every spot between the\r\nGrampians and the Tweedale mountains from sea to sea, without seeing\r\ngranite in its place. I had also travelled from Edinburgh by Grief,\r\nRannock, Dalwhiny, Fort Augustus, Inverness, through east Ross and\r\nCaithness, to the Pentland-Frith or Orkney islands, without seeing one\r\nblock of granite in its place. It is true, I met with it on my return\r\nby the east coast, when I just saw it, and no more, at Peterhead and\r\nAberdeen; but that was all the granite I had ever seen when I wrote\r\nmy Theory of the Earth. I have, since that time, seen it in different\r\nplaces; because I went on purpose to examine it, as I shall have\r\noccasion to describe in the course of this work.\r\n\r\nI may now with some confidence affirm, from my own observation, and from\r\ngood information with regard to those places where I have not been,\r\nexcept the northwest corner, I may affirm, I say, that instead of the\r\nbasis of the greatest part of Scotland being a granitic rock, which our\r\nauthor has maintained as an evident thing, there is very little of it\r\nthat is so; not perhaps one five hundred part. So far also as I am to\r\njudge from my knowledge of the mineral construction of England and\r\nWales, which I have examined with the greatest care, and from the\r\nmineral chart which my friend Mr Watt made for me from his knowledge of\r\nCornwall, I would say that there is scarcely one five hundred part\r\nof Britain that has granite for its basis. All the rest, except the\r\nporphyry and basaltes, consists of stratified bodies, which are composed\r\nmore or less of the materials which I mentioned, generally, in the above\r\nquotation, and which our author would dispute.\r\n\r\nBut do not let me take the advantage of this error of our author with\r\nregard to the mineralogy of Scotland, and thus draw what may be thought\r\nan undue conclusion in favour of my general theory; let us go over and\r\nexamine the continent of Europe, and see if it is any otherwise there\r\nthan in Britain. From the granite of the Ural mountains, to that which\r\nwe find in the Pyrenees, there is no reason, so far as I have been able\r\nto learn, to conclude that things are formed either upon any other\r\nprinciple, or upon a different scale. But, instead of one five hundred\r\npart, let us suppose there to be one fiftieth part of the earth in\r\ngeneral resting upon granite, I could not have expressed myself\r\notherwise than I have done; for, when I maintained that the earth in\r\ngeneral consisted of stratified bodies, I said that this was only _nine\r\ntenths, or perhaps ninety-nine hundredths_ of the whole, and I mentioned\r\nthat there were other masses of a different origin, which should be\r\nconsidered separately. Our author, on the contrary, asserts that the Old\r\nand New Worlds, as well as Scotland, are placed upon granite as a basis,\r\nwhich he says is according to the testimony of all mineralogists.\r\nI shall have occasion to examine this opinion of mineralogists, in\r\ncomparing it with those masses of granite which appear to us; and I hope\r\nfully to refute the geological, as well as mineralogical notions with\r\nregard to that body. In the mean time, let me make the following\r\nreflection, which here naturally occurs.\r\n\r\nMy Theory of the Earth is here examined,--not with the system of\r\nnature, or actual state of things, to which it certainly should have\r\ncorresponded,--but with the systematic views of a person, who has formed\r\nhis notions of geology from the vague opinion of others, and not from\r\nwhat he has seen. Had the question been, How far my theory agreed with\r\nother theories, our author might very properly have informed his readers\r\nthat it was diametrically opposite to the opinions of mineralogists;\r\nbut, this was no reason for concluding it to be erroneous; on the\r\ncontrary, it is rather a presumption that I may have corrected the error\r\nof mineralogists who have gone before me, in like manner as it is most\r\nreasonable to presume that our author may have corrected mine. Let us\r\nthen proceed to examine how far this shall appear to be the case.\r\n\r\nOur author has stated very fairly from the Theory, viz. _That all the\r\nstrata of the earth, not only those consisting of calcareous masses, but\r\nothers superincumbent on these, have had their origin at the bottom\r\nof the sea, by the collection of sand, gravel, shells, coralline, and\r\ncrustaceous bodies, and of earths and clays variously mixed, separated,\r\nand accumulated._ He then adds, \"Various geological observations\r\ncontradict this conclusion. There are many stratified mountains of\r\nargillaceous slate, gneiss, serpentine, jasper, and even marble, in\r\nwhich either sand, gravel, shells, coralline, or crustaceous bodies are\r\nnever, or scarce ever found.\"\r\n\r\nHere our author seems to have deceived himself, by taking a very partial\r\nview of things which should be fully examined, and well understood,\r\nbefore general conclusions are to be drawn from those appearances; for,\r\nalthough those particular objects may not be visible in the strata which\r\nhe has enumerated, or many others, they are found in those strata which\r\nare either immediately connected and alternated with them, or with\r\nsimilar strata; something to that purpose I think I have said; and, if\r\nI had not, it certainly requires no deep penetration to have seen this\r\nclear solution of that appearance of those objects not being found in\r\nevery particular stratum. He says that those marks of known materials\r\nare never or scarce ever found;--by _scarce ever_ he surely means that\r\nthey are sometimes found; but if they shall only _once_ be found, his\r\nargument is lost. I have not drawn my geological conclusion from every\r\nparticle in strata being distinguishable, but from there being certain\r\ndistinguishable particles in strata, and from our knowing what had been\r\nthe former state and circumstances of those distinguished parts.\r\n\r\nIf every stone or part of a stratum, in which those known objects are\r\nnot immediately visible, must be considered as so _many geological\r\nobservations that contradict my theory_, (of strata being formed from\r\nthe materials of a former earth), then, surely every stone and every\r\nstratum which visibly contains any of those materials, must prove my\r\ntheory. But if every stratum, where these are found in any part of it,\r\nis to be concluded as having had its origin at the bottom of the sea;\r\nand, if every concomitant stratum, though not having those objects\r\nvisible or sufficiently distinct, must be considered as having had the\r\nsame or a similar origin, that pretended contradiction of my theory\r\ncomes to no more than this, that every individual stone does not bear\r\nin it the same or equal evidence of that general proposition which\r\nnecessarily results from the attentive consideration of the whole,\r\nincluding every part.\r\n\r\nBut to see how necessary it is to judge in this manner, not partially,\r\nbut upon the whole, we may observe, that there are two ways by which the\r\nvisible materials or distinguishable bodies of a former earth, not only\r\n_may_ be rendered invisible in the composition of our present earth,\r\nbut _must_ be so upon many occasions. These are, _first_, by mechanical\r\ncomminution, which necessarily happens, more or less, in that operation\r\nby which bodies are moved against one another, and thus transported from\r\nthe land to the bottom of the deepest seas; _secondly_, by chemical\r\noperations, (whatever these may be, whether the action of water or of\r\nfire, or both), which are also necessarily employed for consolidating\r\nthose loose materials, that are to form the rocks and stones of\r\nthis earth, and by means of which those materials are to have their\r\ndistinguishable shapes affected in all degrees and obliterated.\r\nTherefore, to demand the visible appearance of those materials in every\r\nstratum of the earth, or in every part of a stratum, is no other than to\r\nmisunderstand the subject altogether. The geological observations,\r\nwhich have been thus alleged as contradicting my theory, are stratified\r\nbodies, containing proofs of the general origin which I attribute to the\r\nearth, but proofs which may not always be seen with equal facility as\r\nthose which even convince the vulgar.\r\n\r\nOur author has surely perplexed himself with what writers of late have\r\nsaid concerning primitive mountains as they are called, a subject of\r\ndeeper search, than is commonly imagined, as I hope to show in the\r\ncourse of this work. It is an interesting subject of investigation,\r\nas giving us the actual view of those operations of nature which, in\r\nforming my Theory of the Earth, more general principles had led me to\r\nconclude _might be_. But, it is a subject which, I am afraid, will lead\r\nme to give farther offence to our author, however innocent I may be in\r\ngiving nothing but what I have from nature.\r\n\r\nThe reason for saying so is this; I am blamed for having endeavoured\r\nto trace back the operations of this world to a remote period, by the\r\nexamination of that which actually appears, contrary, as is alleged,\r\n\"to reason, and the tenor of the Mosaic history, thus leading to an\r\nabyss, from which human reason recoils, etc.\" In a word, (says our\r\nauthor), \"to make use of his own expression, _We find no vestige of\r\na beginning._ Then this system of successive worlds must have been\r\neternal.\" Such is the logic by which, I suppose, I am to be accused of\r\natheism. Our author might have added, that I have also said--_we see\r\nno prospect of an end_; but what has all this to do with the idea of\r\neternity? Are we, with our ideas of _time_, (or mere succession), to\r\nmeasure that of eternity, which never succeeded any thing, and which\r\nwill never be succeeded? Are we thus to measure eternity, that boundless\r\nthought, with those physical notions of ours which necessarily limit\r\nboth space and time? and, because we see not the beginning of created\r\nthings, Are we to conclude that those things which we see have always\r\nbeen, or been without a cause? Our author would thus, inadvertently\r\nindeed, lead himself into that gulf of irreligion and absurdity into\r\nwhich, he alleges, I have _boldly plunged_.\r\n\r\nIn examining this present earth, we find that it must have had its\r\norigin at the bottom of the sea, although our author seems willing to\r\ndeny that proposition. Farther, in examining the internal construction\r\nof this stratified and sea-born mass, we find that it had been composed\r\nof the moved materials of a former earth; and, from the most accurate\r\nand extensive examination of those materials, which in many places are\r\nindeed much disguised, we are led necessarily to conclude, that there\r\nhad been a world existing, and containing an animal, a vegetable, and a\r\nmineral system. But, in thus tracing back the natural operations which\r\nhave succeeded each other, and mark to us the course of time past, we\r\ncome to a period in which we cannot see any farther. This, however,\r\nis not the beginning of those operations which proceed in time and\r\naccording to the wise economy of this world; nor is it the establishing\r\nof that, which, in the course of time, had no beginning; it is only the\r\nlimit of our retrospective view of those operations which have come to\r\npass in time, and have been conducted by supreme intelligence.\r\n\r\nMy principal anxiety was to show how the constitution of this world\r\nhad been wisely contrived; and this I endeavoured to do, not from\r\nsupposition or conjecture, but from its answering so effectually the end\r\nof its intention, viz. the preserving of animal life, which we cannot\r\ndoubt of being its purpose. Here then is a world that is not eternal,\r\nbut which has been the effect of wisdom or design.\r\n\r\nWith regard again to the prospective view of the creation, How are we to\r\nsee the end of that wise system of things which so properly fulfils the\r\nbenevolent intention of its maker,--in giving sustenance to the animal\r\npart, and information to intellectual beings, who, in these works of\r\nnature, read what much concerns their peace of mind,--their intellectual\r\nhappiness? What then does our author mean, in condemning that\r\ncomprehensive view which I have endeavoured to take of nature? Would he\r\ndeny that there is to be perceived wisdom in the system of this world,\r\nor that a philosopher, who looks into the operations of nature, may not\r\nplainly read the power and wisdom of the Creator, without recoiling, as\r\nhe says, from the abyss? The abyss, from which a man of science should\r\nrecoil, is that of ignorance and error.\r\n\r\nI have thus shown, that, from not perceiving the wise disposition of\r\nthings upon the surface of this earth for the preservation of vegetable\r\nbodies, our author has been led to deny the necessary waste of the\r\npresent earth, and the consequent preparation of materials for the\r\nconstruction of another; I have also shown, that he denies the origin\r\nwhich I had attributed to the stratified parts of this earth, as having\r\nbeen the collection of moving materials from a former earth; and now\r\nI am come to consider the professed purpose of this paper, viz. the\r\nexamination of solid stony substances which we find in those strata\r\nof our earth, as well as in more irregular masses. Here, no doubt, my\r\ntheory would have been attacked with greater success, had our author\r\nsucceeded in pointing out its error with regard to the original\r\ncomposition of those indurated bodies, to which I ascribe fusion as the\r\ncause of their solidity. For, if we should, according to our author's\r\nproposition, consider those consolidated bodies as having been\r\noriginally formed in that solid state, here the door might be shut\r\nagainst any farther investigation;--But to what purpose?--Surely not to\r\nrefute my theory, but to explode every physical inquiry farther on the\r\nsubject, and thus to lead us back into the science of darkness and of\r\nscepticism. But let us proceed to see our author's sentiments on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAs I had proved from matter of fact, or the actual appearances of\r\nnature, that all the strata of the earth had been formed at the bottom\r\nof the sea, by the subsidence of those materials which either come from\r\nthe decaying land, or are formed in the sea itself, it was necessary\r\nthat I should consider in what manner those spongy or porous bodies of\r\nloose materials, gathered together at the bottom of the sea, could have\r\nacquired that consolidated state in which we find them, now that they\r\nare brought up to our examination. Upon this occasion, our author says,\r\n\"The particles which now form the solid parts of the globe need not be\r\nsupposed to have originally been either spongy or porous, the interior\r\nparts at the depth of a few miles might have been originally, as at\r\npresent, a solid mass.\" If, indeed, we shall make that supposition, we\r\nmay then save ourselves the trouble of considering either how the strata\r\nof the earth have been formed or consolidated; for, they might have been\r\nso originally. But, how can a naturalist who had ever seen a piece of\r\nDerbyshire marble, or any other shell limestone, make that supposition?\r\nHere are, to the satisfaction of every body of common understanding who\r\nlooks at them, bodies which are perfectly consolidated, bodies which\r\nhave evidently been formed at the bottom of the sea, and therefore which\r\nwere not originally a solid mass. Mr Bertrand, it is true, wrote a book\r\nto prove that those appearances were nothing but a _lusus naturae_; and,\r\nI suppose he meant, with our author, that those strata had been also\r\noriginally, as at present, a solid mass.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the consolidation of strata, that cardinal point for\r\ndiscussion, our author gives the following answer: \"Abstracting from his\r\nown gratuitous hypothesis, it is very easy to satisfy our author on this\r\nhead; the concreting and consolidating power in most cases arises from\r\nthe mutual attraction of the component particles of stones to each\r\nother.\" This is an answer with regard to the _concreting power_, a\r\nsubject about which we certainly are not here inquiring. Our author,\r\nindeed, has mentioned a _consolidating power_; but that is an improper\r\nexpression; we are here inquiring, How the interstices, between the\r\ncollected materials of strata, deposited at the bottom of the sea, have\r\nbeen filled with a hard substance, instead of the fluid water which had\r\noriginally occupied those spaces. Our author then continues; \"If these\r\nparticles leave any interstices, these are filled with water, which no\r\nways obstructs their solidity when the points of contact are numerous;\r\nhence the decrepitation of many species of stones when heated.\"\r\n\r\nIf I understand our author's argument, the particles of stone are, by\r\ntheir mutual attractions, to leave those hard and solid bodies which\r\ncompose the strata, that is to say, those hard bodies are to dissolve\r\nthemselves; but, To what purpose? This must be to fill up the\r\ninterstices, which we must suppose occupied by the water. In that case,\r\nwe should find the original interstices filled with the substances which\r\nhad composed the strata, and we should find the water translated into\r\nthe places of those bodies; here would be properly a transmutation, but\r\nno consolidation of the strata, such as we are here to look for, and\r\nsuch as we actually find among those strata. It may be very easy for\r\nour author to form those explanations of natural phenomena; it costs\r\nno tedious observation of facts, which are to be gathered with labour,\r\npatience, and attention; he has but to look into his own fancy, as\r\nphilosophers did in former times, when they saw the abhorrence of a\r\nvacuum and explained the pump. It is thus that we are here told the\r\nconsolidation of strata _arises from the mutual attraction of the\r\ncomponent particles of stones to each other_; the power, by which the\r\nparticles of solid stony bodies retain their places in relation to each\r\nother, and resist separation from the mass, may, no doubt, be properly\r\nenough termed their mutual attractions; but we are not here inquiring\r\nafter that power; we are to investigate the power by which the particles\r\nof hard and stony bodies had been separated, contrary to their mutual\r\nattractions, in order to form new concretions, by being again brought\r\nwithin the spheres of action in which their mutual attractions might\r\ntake place, and make them one solid body. Now, to say that this is by\r\ntheir mutual attraction, is either to misunderstand the proper question,\r\nor to give a most preposterous answer.\r\n\r\nIt is not every one who is fit to reason with regard to abstract general\r\npropositions; I will now, therefore, state a particular case, in\r\nillustration of that proposition which has been here so improperly\r\nanswered. The strata of Derbyshire marbles were originally immense\r\ncollections at the bottom of the sea, of calcareous bodies consisting\r\nalmost wholly of various fragments of the _entrochi_; and they were then\r\ncovered with an indefinite number of other strata under which these\r\n_entrochi_ must have been buried. In this original state of those\r\nstrata, I suppose the interstices between the fragments of the coralline\r\nbodies to have been left full of sea-water; at present we find those\r\ninterstices completely filled with a most perfectly solid body of\r\nmarble; and the question is, whether that consolidating operation\r\nhas been the work of water and solution, by our naturalist's termed\r\ninfiltration; or if it has been performed, as I have maintained, by the\r\nsoftening power or heat, or introduction of matter in the fluid state\r\nof fusion. Our author does not propose any other method for the\r\nconsolidation of those loose and incoherent bodies, but he speaks of the\r\n_mutual attraction of the component particles of stone to each other_;\r\nWill that fill the interstices between the coralline bodies with solid\r\nmarble, as well as consolidate the coralline bodies themselves? or, if\r\nit should, How are those interstices to be thus filled with a substance\r\nperfectly different from the deposited bodies, which is also frequently\r\nthe case? But, how reason with a person who, with this consolidation of\r\nstrata, confounds the well known operation by which the mortar, made\r\nwith caustic lime and sand, becomes a hard body! One would imagine\r\nthat he were writing to people of the last age, and not to chemical\r\nphilosophers who know so well how that mortar is concreted.\r\n\r\nTo my argument, That these porous strata are found _consolidated with\r\nevery different species of mineral substance_, our author makes the\r\nfollowing observation: \"Here the difficulties to the supposition of an\r\naqueous solution are placed in the strongest light; yet it must be owned\r\nthat they partly arise from the author's own gratuitous supposition,\r\nthat strata existed at the bottom of the sea previous to their\r\nconsolidation;\"--gratuitous supposition!--so far from being a\r\nsupposition of any kind, it is a self evident proposition; the terms\r\nnecessarily imply the conclusion. I beg the readers attention for a\r\nmoment to this part of our author's animadversion, before proceeding to\r\nconsider the whole; for, this is a point so essential in my theory,\r\nthat if it be a gratuitous supposition, as is here asserted, it would\r\ncertainly be in vain to attempt to build upon it the system of a world.\r\n\r\nThat strata may exist, whether at the bottom of the sea, or any other\r\nwhere, without being consolidated, will hardly be disputed; for, they\r\nare actually found consolidated in every different degree. But, when\r\nstrata are found consolidated, at what time is it that we are to suppose\r\nthis event to have taken place, or this accident to have happened to\r\nthem?--Strata are formed at the bottom of water, by the subsidence or\r\nsuccessive deposits of certain materials; it could not therefore\r\nbe during their formation that such strata had been consolidated;\r\nconsequently, we must necessarily _conclude_, without any degree of\r\n_supposition_, that _strata had existed at the bottom of the sea\r\nprevious to their consolidation_, unless our author can show how they\r\nmay have been consolidated previous to their existing.\r\n\r\nThis then is what our author has termed a gratuitous supposition of\r\nmine, and which, he adds, \"is a circumstance which will not be allowed\r\nby the patrons of the aqueous origin of stony substances, as we have\r\nalready seen.\"--I am perfectly at a loss to guess at what is here\r\nalluded to _by having been already seen_, unless it be that which I have\r\nalready quoted, concerning things which have been never seen, that\r\nis, _those interior parts of the earth which were originally a solid\r\nmass_.--I have hardly patience to answer such reasoning;--a reasoning\r\nwhich is not founded upon any principle, which holds up nothing\r\nbut chimera to our view, and which ends in nothing that is\r\nintelligible;--but, others, perhaps, may see this dissertation of our\r\nauthor's in a different light; therefore, it is my duty to analyse the\r\nargument, however insignificant it may seem to me.\r\n\r\nI have minutely examined all the stratified bodies which I have been\r\nable, during a lifetime, to procure, both in this country of Britain,\r\nand from all the quarters of the globe; and the result of my inquiry has\r\nbeen to conclude, that there is nothing among them in an original state,\r\nas the reader will see in the preceding chapter. With regard again to\r\nthe masses which are not stratified, I have also given proof that they\r\nare not in their original state, such as granite, porphyry, serpentine,\r\nand basaltes; and I shall give farther satisfaction, I hope, upon that\r\nhead, in the course of this work. I have therefore concluded, That there\r\nis nothing to be found in an original state, so far as we see, in the\r\nconstruction of this earth. But, our author answers, That the interior\r\nparts _might have been in an original state of solidity_.--So might\r\nthey have been upon the surface of the earth, or on the summits of our\r\nmountains; but, we are not inquiring What they _might have been_, but\r\nWhat they truly _are_. It is from this actual state in which the solid\r\nparts of the earth are found, that I have endeavoured to trace back the\r\ndifferent states in which they must have been; and, by generalising\r\nfacts, I have formed a theory of the earth. If this be a wrong principle\r\nor manner of proceeding in a physical investigation, or if, proceeding\r\nupon that principle, I have made the induction by reasoning improperly\r\non any occasion, let this be corrected by philosophers, who may reason\r\nmore accurately upon the subject. But to oppose a physical investigation\r\nwith this proposition, _that things might have been otherwise_, is to\r\nproceed upon a very different principle,--a principle which, instead of\r\ntending to bring light out of darkness, is only calculated to extinguish\r\nthat light which we may have acquired.\r\n\r\nI shall afterwards have occasion to examine how far the philosophers,\r\nwho attribute to aqueous solution the origin of stony substances, have\r\nproceeded in the same inductive manner of reasoning from effect to\r\ncause, as they ought to do in physical subjects, and not by feigning\r\ncauses, or following a false analogy; in the mean time, I am to answer\r\nthe objections which have been made to the theory of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the theory of consolidating bodies by fusion, our\r\nauthor has taken great pains to show, that I cannot provide materials\r\nfor such a fire as would be necessary, nor find the means to make it\r\nburn had I those materials. Had our author read attentively my theory he\r\nwould have observed, that I give myself little or no trouble about that\r\nfire, or take no charge with regard to the procuring of that power, as I\r\nhave not founded my theory on the _supposition_ of subterraneous\r\nfire, however that fire properly follows as a conclusion from those\r\nappearances on which the theory is founded. My theory is founded upon\r\nthe general appearances of mineral bodies, and upon this, that mineral\r\nbodies must necessarily have been in a state of fusion. I do not pretend\r\nto prove, demonstratively, that they had been even hot, however that\r\nconclusion also naturally follows from their having been in fusion. It\r\nis sufficient for me to demonstrate, That those bodies must have been,\r\nmore or less, in a state of softness and fluidity, without any species\r\nof solution. I do not say that this fluidity had been without heat;\r\nbut, if that had been the case, it would have answered equally well the\r\npurpose of my theory, so far as this went to explain the consolidation\r\nof strata or mineral bodies, which, I still repeat, must have been\r\nby simple fluidity, and not by any species of solution, or any other\r\nsolvent than that universal one which permeates all bodies, and which\r\nmakes them fluid.\r\n\r\nOur author has justly remarked the difficulty of fire burning below the\r\nearth and sea. It is not my purpose here to endeavour to remove those\r\ndifficulties, which perhaps only exist in those suppositions which are\r\nmade on this occasion; my purpose is to show, that he had no immediate\r\nconcern with that question, in discussing the subject of the\r\nconsolidation which we actually find in the strata of the earth, unless\r\nmy theory, with regard to the igneous origin of stony substances, had\r\nproceeded upon the supposition of a subterraneous fire. It is surely one\r\nthing to employ fire and heat to melt mineral bodies, in supposing this\r\nto be the cause of their consolidation, and another thing to acknowledge\r\nfire or heat as having been exerted upon mineral bodies, when it is\r\nclearly proved, from actual appearances, that those bodies had been in\r\na melted state, or that of simple fluidity. Here are distinctions which\r\nwould be thrown away upon the vulgar; but, to a man of science, who\r\nanalyses arguments, and reasons strictly from effect to cause, this is,\r\nI believe, the proper way of coming at the truth. If the patrons of\r\nthe aqueous origin of stony substances can give us any manner of\r\nscientifical, _i.e._ intelligible investigation of that process, it\r\nshall be attended to with the most rigid impartiality, even by a patron\r\nof the igneous origin of those substances, as he wishes above all things\r\nto distinguish, in the mineral operations, those which, on the one hand,\r\nhad been the effect of water, from those which, on the other hand, had\r\nbeen the immediate effect of fire or fusion;--this has been my greatest\r\nstudy. But, while mineralists or geologists give us only mere opinions,\r\nWhat is science profited by such inconsequential observations, as are\r\nfounded upon nothing but our vulgar notions? Is the figure of the\r\nearth, _e.g._ to be doubted, because, according to the common notion of\r\nmankind, the existence of an antipod is certainly to be denied?\r\n\r\nI am not avoiding to meet that question with regard to the providing\r\nof materials for such a mineral fire as may be required; no question I\r\ndesire more to be asked to resolve; but it must not be in the manner\r\nthat our author has put that question. He has included this supposed\r\ndifficulty among a string of other arguments by which he would refute my\r\ntheory with regard to the igneous origin of stony substances, as if I\r\nhad made that fire a necessary condition or a principle in forming my\r\ntheory of consolidation. Now, it is precisely the reverse; and this is\r\nwhat I beg that mineral philosophers will particularly attend to, and\r\nnot give themselves so much unnecessary trouble, and me so disagreeable\r\na talk. I have proved that those stony substances have been in the fluid\r\nstate of fusion; and from this, I have inferred the former existence of\r\nan internal heat, a subterraneous fire, or a certain cause of fusion by\r\nwhatever name it shall be called, and by whatever means it shall have\r\nbeen procured. The nature of that operation by which strata had been\r\nconsolidated, like that by which they had been composed, must, according\r\nto my philosophy, be decided by ocular demonstration; from examining the\r\ninternal evidence which is to be found in those bodies as we see them in\r\nthe earth; because the consolidating operation is not performed in our\r\nsight, no more than their stratification which our author has also\r\ndenied to have been made, as I have said, by the deposits of materials\r\nat the bottom of the sea. Now, with regard to the means of procuring\r\nsubterraneous fire, if the consolidating operation shall be thus decided\r\nto have been that of fusion, as I think I have fully shown, and for\r\nwhich I have as many witnesses, perhaps as there are mineral bodies,\r\nthen our author's question, (how I am to procure a fire) in the way that\r\nhe has put it, as an argument against the fusion, would be at least\r\nuseless; for, though I should here confess my ignorance with regard to\r\nthe means of procuring fire, the evidence of the melting operation, or\r\nformer fluidity of those mineral bodies, would not be thereby in the\r\nleast diminished. If again no such evidence for the fusion of those\r\nbodies shall appear, and it be concluded that they had been consolidated\r\nby the action of water alone, as our author seems inclined to maintain,\r\nhe would have no occasion to start difficulties about the procuring of\r\nfire, in order to refute a theory which then would fall of itself as\r\nhaving no foundation.\r\n\r\nBut in order to see this author's notion of the theory which he is here\r\nexamining, it may be proper to give a specimen of his reasoning upon\r\nthis subject of heat. He says, \"That my supposition of heat necessary\r\nfor consolidating strata is _gratuitous_, not only because it is\r\nunnecessary, as we have already shown, but also because it is\r\ninconsistent with our author's own theory.\" Let us now consider those\r\ntwo propositions. _First_, it is unnecessary, _as we have already\r\nshown_;--I have already taken particular notice of what we have been\r\nshown on this occasion, viz. That the earth at a certain depth _may\r\nhave been originally in a solid state_; and, that, where it is to be\r\nconsolidated, this is done by the _mutual attraction of the stony\r\nparticles_. Here is all that we have been shown to make subterraneous\r\nheat, for the consolidation of strata, unnecessary; and now I humbly\r\nsubmit, if this is sufficient evidence, that mineral heat is a\r\ngratuitous supposition.\r\n\r\nSecondly, \"_it is inconsistent with our author's own theory._\" Here\r\nI would beg the readers attention to the reasoning employed on\r\nthis occasion. He says, \"according to him these strata, which were\r\nconsolidated by heat, were composed of materials gradually worn from a\r\npreceding continent, casually and successively deposited in the sea;\r\nWhere then will he find, and how will he suppose, to have been formed\r\nthose enormous masses of sulphur, coal, or bitumen, necessary to produce\r\nthat immense heat necessary for the fusion of those vast mountains of\r\nstone now existing? All the coal, sulphur, and bitumen, now known, does\r\nnot form the 100,000 part of the materials deposited within one quarter\r\nof a mile under the surface of the earth; if, therefore, they were, as\r\nhis hypothesis demands, carried off and mixed with the other materials,\r\nand not formed in vast and separate collections, they could never\r\noccasion, by their combustion, a heat capable of producing the smallest\r\neffect, much less those gigantic effects which he requires.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a comparative estimate formed between two things which have not\r\nany necessary relation; these are, the quantity of combustible materials\r\nfound in the earth, on the one hand, and the quantity which is supposed\r\nnecessary for hardening and consolidating strata, on the other. If this\r\nearth has been consolidated by the burning of combustible materials,\r\nthere must have been a superfluity, so far as there is a certain\r\nquantity of these actually found unconsumed in the strata of the earth.\r\nOur author's conclusion is the very opposite; let us then see how he\r\nis to form his argument, by which he proves that the supposition of\r\nsubterraneous heat for hardening bodies is gratuitous and unnecessary,\r\nas being inconsistent with my theory.\r\n\r\nAccording to my theory, the strata of this earth are composed of the\r\nmaterials which came from a former earth; particularly these combustible\r\nstrata that contain plants which must have grown upon the land. Let\r\nus then suppose the subterraneous fire supplied with its combustible\r\nmaterials from this source, the vegetable bodies growing upon the\r\nsurface of the land. Here is a source provided for the supplying of\r\nmineral fire, a source which is inexhaustible or unlimited, unless\r\nwe are to circumscribe it with regard to time, and the necessary\r\ningredients; such as the matter of light, carbonic matter, and the\r\nhydrogenous principle. But it is not upon any deficiency of this kind\r\nthat our author founds his estimate; it is upon the superfluity of\r\ncombustible materials which is actually found in this earth, after it\r\nhad been properly consolidated and raised above the surface of the sea.\r\nThis is a method of reasoning calculated to convince only those who do\r\nnot understand it; it is as if we should conclude that a person had died\r\nof want, because he had left provision behind him. Our author certainly\r\nmeans to employ nothing but the combustible minerals of the present\r\nearth, in feeding the subterraneous fire which is to concoct a future\r\nearth; in that case, I will allow that his provision is deficient; but\r\nthis is not my theory.\r\n\r\nI am not here to enter into any argument concerning subterraneous\r\nfire; the reader will find, in the foregoing theory, my reasons for\r\nconcluding, That subterraneous fire had existed previous to, and ever\r\nsince, the formation of this earth,--that it exists in all its vigour\r\nat this day,--that there is, in the constitution of this earth, a\r\nsuperfluity of subterranean heat,--and that there is wisely provided a\r\nproper remedy against any destructive effect to the system, that might\r\narise from that superabundant provision of this necessary agent. Had our\r\nauthor attended to the ocular proof that we have of the actual existence\r\nof subterraneous fire, and to the physical demonstrations which I have\r\ngiven of the effects of heat in melting mineral bodies, he must have\r\nseen that those arguments of his, with regard to the difficulty or\r\nimpossibility of procuring that fire, can only show the error of his\r\nreasoning. I am far from supposing that my theory may be free from\r\ninconsistency or error; I am only maintaining that, in all his confident\r\nassertions, this author has not hitherto pointed any of these out.\r\n\r\nSo far I have answered our author's objections as to consolidation, and\r\nI have given a specimen of his reasoning upon that subject; but with\r\nregard to my Theory of the Earth, although simple fluidity, without\r\nheat, would have answered the purpose of consolidating strata that had\r\nbeen formed at the bottom of the sea, it was necessary to provide a\r\npower for raising those consolidated strata from that low place to the\r\nsummits of the continents; now, in supposing heat to be the cause of\r\nthat fluidity which had been employed in the consolidation of those\r\nsubmarine masses, we find a power capable of erecting continents, and\r\nthe only power, so far as I see, which natural philosophy can employ\r\nfor that purpose. Thus I was led, from the consolidation of strata, to\r\nunderstand the nature of the elevating power, and, from the nature of\r\nthat power, again to understand the cause of fluidity by which the rocks\r\nand stones of this earth had been consolidated.\r\n\r\nHaving thus, without employing the evidence of any fire or _burning_,\r\nbeen necessarily led to conclude an extreme degree of heat exerted in\r\nthe mineral regions, I next inquire how far there are any appearances\r\nfrom whence we might conclude whether that active subterraneous power\r\nstill subsists, and what may be the nature of that power. When first I\r\nconceived my theory, naturalists were far from suspecting that basaltic\r\nrocks were of volcanic origin; I could not then have employed an\r\nargument from these rocks as I may do now, for proving that the fires,\r\nwhich we see almost daily issuing with such force from volcanos, are a\r\ncontinuation of that active cause which has so evidently been exerted\r\nin all times, and in all places, so far as have been examined of this\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the degree of heat in that subterraneous fire, our\r\nauthor, after proving that combustible materials would not burn in the\r\nmineral regions, then says, that suppose they were to burn, this would\r\nbe \"incapable of forming a heat even equal to that of our common\r\nfurnaces, as Mr Dolomieu has clearly shown to be the case with respect\r\nto volcanic heat.\" The place to which he alludes, I believe to be that\r\nwhich I have quoted from the Journal de Physique (Part I. page 139) to\r\nwhich I here beg leave to refer the reader. After what I have already\r\nsaid, this subject will appear to be of little concern to me; but, it\r\nmust be considered, that my object, in these answers, is not so much to\r\njustify the theory which I have given, as it is to remove that prejudice\r\nwhich, to those who are not master of chemical and mineral subjects,\r\nwill naturally arise from the opinion or authority of a scientific man,\r\nand a chemist; therefore, I think it my business to show how much he\r\nhas misconceived the matter which he treats of, and how much he\r\nmisunderstands the subject of my theory.\r\n\r\nMr Dolomieu alleges that the volcanic fire operates in the melting of\r\nbodies, not by the intensity of its heat, which is the means employed by\r\nus in our operations, but in the long continuance of its action. But in\r\nthat proposition, this philosopher is merely giving us his opinion; and,\r\nthis opinion our author mistakes, I suppose, for the fact on which that\r\nopinion had been (perhaps reasonably) founded. The reader will see, in\r\nthe place quoted, or in the _avant-propos_ to his _Mémoire sur les Iles\r\nPonces_, the fact to be this; That the Chevalier Dolomieu finds those\r\nbodies which we either cannot melt in our fires, or which we cannot melt\r\nwithout changing them by calcination and vitrification, he finds, I say,\r\nthese substances had actually been melted with his lavas; he also finds\r\nthose substances, which are necessarily dissipated in our fires, to have\r\nbeen retained in those melted mineral substances. Had our author quoted\r\nthe text, instead of giving us his own interpretation, he could not have\r\noffered a stronger confirmation of my theory; which certainly is not\r\nconcerned with the particular intensity of volcanic fire, and far less\r\nwith what may be the opinion of any naturalist with regard to that\r\nintensity, but only with the efficacy of that volcanic heat for the\r\nmelting of mineral substances. Now this efficacy of volcanic fire, so\r\nfar as we are to found upon the authority given on this occasion, is\r\nclearly confirmed by the observations of a most intelligent mineralist,\r\nand one who is actually a patron of the opposite theory to that which I\r\nhave given. This being the state of the case, Must I not conclude, that\r\nour author has misunderstood the subject, and that he has been led to\r\ngive a mutilated opinion of Mr Dolomieu, in order to refute my theory,\r\nwhen either the entire opinion, or the facts on which the opinion had\r\nbeen founded, would have confirmed it?\r\n\r\nI have thus endeavoured to put in its true light a species of reasoning,\r\nwhich, while it assumes the air and form of that inductive train of\r\nthought employed by men of science for the investigation of nature, is\r\nonly fit to mislead the unwary, and, when closely examined, will appear\r\nto be inconsequential or unfounded. How mortifying then to find, that\r\none may be employed almost a lifetime in generalising the phenomena of\r\nnature, or in gathering an infinity of evidence for the forming of a\r\ntheory, and that the consequence of this shall only be to give offence,\r\nand to receive reproach from those who see not things in the same\r\nlight!--While man has to learn, mankind must have different opinions.\r\nIt is the prerogative of man to form opinions; these indeed are often,\r\ncommonly I may say, erroneous; but they are commonly corrected, and it\r\nis thus that truth in general is made to appear.\r\n\r\nI wrote a general Theory for the inspection of philosophers, who\r\ndoubtless will point out its errors; but this requires the study of\r\nnature, which is not the work of a day; and, in this political age, the\r\nstudy of nature seems to be but little pursued by our philosophers. In\r\nthe mean time, there are, on the one hand, sceptical philosophers, who\r\nthink there is nothing certain in nature, because there is misconception\r\nin the mind of man; on the other hand, there are many credulous\r\namateurs, who go to nature to be entertained as we go to see a\r\npantomime: But there are also superficial reasoning men, who think\r\nthemselves qualified to write on subjects on which they may have read\r\nin books,--subjects which they may have seen in cabinets, and which,\r\nperhaps, they have just learned to name; without truly knowing what they\r\nsee, they think they know those regions of the earth which never can be\r\nseen; and they judge of the great operations of the mineral kingdom,\r\nfrom having kindled a fire, and looked into the bottom of a little\r\ncrucible.\r\n\r\nIn the Theory of the Earth which was published, I was anxious to warn\r\nthe reader against the notion that subterraneous heat and fusion could\r\nbe compared with that which we induce by our chemical operations\r\non mineral substances here upon the surface of the earth; yet,\r\nnotwithstanding all the precaution I had taken, our author has bestowed\r\nfour quarto pages in proving to me, that our fires have an effect upon\r\nmineral substances different from that of the subterraneous power which\r\nI would employ.\r\n\r\nHe then sets about combining metals with sulphur in the moist way, as if\r\nthat were any more to his purpose than is the making of a stalactite for\r\nthe explanation of marble. Silver and lead may be sulphurated, as he\r\nsays, with hepatic gas; but, Has the sulphurated solid ores of those\r\nmetals, and that of iron, been formed in the moist way, as in some\r\nmeasure they may be by the fusion of our fires? But, even suppose that\r\nthis were the case, Could that explain a thousand other appearances\r\nwhich are inconsistent with the operation of water? We see aerated lead\r\ndissolved in the excavations of our mines, and again concreted by the\r\nseparation of the evaporated solvent, in like manner as stalactical\r\nconcretions are made of calcareous earth; but, so far from explaining\r\nmineral appearances, as having had their concretions formed in the same\r\nmanner, here is the most convincing argument against it; for, among the\r\ninfinite variety of mineral productions which we find in nature, Why\r\ndoes no other example of aqueous concretion ever occur upon the surface\r\nof the earth except those which we understand so well, and which we\r\ntherefore know cannot be performed in the bodies of strata not exposed\r\nto the evaporation of the solvent, a circumstance which is necessary.\r\n\r\nI have given a very remarkable example of mineral fusion, in reguline\r\nmanganese, (as the reader will see in page 68.) It is not that this\r\nexample is more to the purpose of my theory than what may be found in\r\nevery species of stone; but this example speaks so immediately to\r\nthe common sense of mankind, (who are often convinced by a general\r\nresemblance of things, when they may not see the force of demonstration\r\nfrom an abstract principle) that I thought it deserved a place on that\r\naccount, as well as being a curious example, But more particularly to my\r\nantagonist, who has been pleased (very improperly indeed) to try some\r\npart of my theory in the fire, here is an example which should have\r\nbeen absolutely in point, and without any manner of exception:--Has he\r\nacknowledged this?--No; he has, on the contrary, endeavoured to set this\r\nvery example aside.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, he says, \"Manganese has been found in a reguline state\r\nby M. de la Peyrouse, and in small grains, as when produced by fire.\r\nTrue; but it was mixed with a large quantity of iron, which is often,\r\nfound in that form without any suspicion of fusion. A fire capable of\r\nmelting quartz might surely produce it in larger masses.\" We have here\r\na kind of two arguments, for removing the effect of this example; and I\r\nshall consider them separately.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is, the not being suspected of having been in fusion;\r\nnow, if this were to be admitted as an argument against the igneous\r\norigin of stony substances, it might have superseded the adducing of any\r\nother, for it is applicable perhaps to every mineral; but we must here\r\nexamine the case more minutely.\r\n\r\nThis argument, of the manganese being in a mine of iron, if I understand\r\nit rightly, amounts to this, that, as iron ore is not suspected of\r\nhaving been melted, therefore, we should doubt the manganese having been\r\nso. If this be our author's meaning, it is not the fair conclusion which\r\nthe case admits of; for, so far as the manganese appears evidently to\r\nhave been in a melted state, the iron ore should be _suspected_ of\r\nhaving been also in fusion, were there no other evidence of that fact.\r\nIn science, however, it is not suspicion that should be employed in\r\nphysical investigation; the question at present is; If the phenomena of\r\nthe case correspond to the conclusion which the intelligent mineralist,\r\nwho examined them, has formed? and, to this question, our author gives\r\nno direct answer. He says, _iron is often found in that form without any\r\nsuspicion of fusion_. This is what I am now to answer.\r\n\r\nThe form in which the manganese appears is one of the strongest proofs\r\nof those masses having been in fusion; and, if iron should ever be found\r\nin that form, it must give the same proof of mineral fusion as this\r\nexample of manganese; let us then see the nature of this evidence. The\r\nform of the manganese is that of a fluid body collecting itself into a\r\nspherical figure by the cohesion or attraction of its particles, so far\r\nas may be admitted by other circumstances; but, being here refilled by\r\nthe solid part on which it rests, this spherical body is flattened by\r\nthe gravitation of its substance. Now here is a regular form, which\r\ndemonstrates the masses to have been in the state of fusion; for, there\r\nis no other way in which that form of those reguline masses could have\r\nbeen induced.\r\n\r\nThere now remains to be considered what our author has observed\r\nrespecting the intensity of the fire and size of the masses. \"A\r\nfire capable of melting quartz might surely produce it (meaning the\r\nmanganese) in larger masses.\" M. de la Peyrouse says, that those masses\r\nwere in all respects as if formed by art, only much larger, as the\r\npowers of nature exceed those of our laboratories. What then is it that\r\nis here meant to be disputed? We are comparing the operation of nature\r\nand that of art, and these are to be judged of by the product which we\r\nexamine; but the quantity, in this case, or the size of the masses,\r\nmakes no part of the evidence, and therefore is here most improperly\r\nmentioned by our author. With regard again to the nature of the fire by\r\nwhich the fusion had been produced, he is much mistaken if he imagines\r\nthat the reduction of the reguline or metallic manganese depends upon\r\nthe intensity of the heat; it depends upon circumstances proper for the\r\nseparation of the oxygenating principle from the calx, in like manner as\r\nthe calcination of calcareous spar must depend upon circumstances proper\r\nfor allowing the separation of the carbonic acid or fixed air.\r\n\r\nBut do not let us lose sight of our proper subject, by examining things\r\nforeign or not so immediately to the purpose. We are only inquiring if\r\nthose flattened spheres of native manganese had been formed by water, or\r\nif it were by fusion; for, our author agrees that there is no other way.\r\nWhy then does he endeavour to evade giving a direct answer, and fly away\r\nto consider the quantity of the product, as if that had any thing to do\r\nwith, the question, or as if that quantity were not sufficient, neither\r\nof which is the case. In short, our author's whole observation, on this\r\noccasion, looks as if he were willing to destroy, by insinuation, the\r\nforce of an argument which proves the theory of mineral fusion; and that\r\nhe wishes to render doubtful, by a species of sophistry, what in fair\r\nreasoning he cannot deny.\r\n\r\nOur author has written upon the subject of phlogiston; one would suppose\r\nthat he should be well acquainted with inflammable bodies at least; let\r\nus see then what he has to observe upon that subject. He quotes from\r\nmy Theory, that spar, quartz, pyrites, crystallised upon or near each\r\nother, and adhering to coal, or mixed with bitumen, etc. are found;\r\ncircumstances that cannot be explained in the hypothesis of solution\r\nin the moist way.--He then answers;--\"Not exactly, nor with certainty;\r\nwhich is not wonderful: But they are still less explicable in the\r\nhypothesis of dry solution, as must be apparent from what has been\r\nalready said. How coal, an infusible substance, could be spread into\r\nstrata by mere heat, is to me incomprehensible.\"--It is only upon the\r\nlast sentence that I am here to remark: This, I believe, will be a\r\nsufficient specimen of our author's understanding, with regard at least\r\nto my Theory which he is here examining.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see what I have said upon the subject of coal, by\r\nturning back to the second section of the preceding chapter. I had given\r\nalmost three quarto pages upon that subject, endeavouring to explain how\r\nall the different degrees of _infusibility_ were produced, by means of\r\nheat and distillation, in strata which had been originally more or less\r\noily, bituminous, and _fusible_; and now our author says, that it is\r\nincomprehensible to him, how coal, _an infusible substance_, could be\r\nspread into strata by mere heat.--So it truly may, either to him or to\r\nany other person; but, it appears to me almost as incomprehensible, how\r\na person of common understanding should read my Dissertation, and impute\r\nto it a thing so contrary to its doctrine.\r\n\r\nNothing can better illustrate the misconceived view that our author\r\nseems to have taken of the two opposite theories, (_i. e_. of\r\nconsolidation by means of heat, and by means of water alone,) than\r\nhis observation upon the case of mineral alkali. To that irrefragable\r\nargument (which Dr Black suggested) in proof of this substance having\r\nbeen in a state of fusion in the mineral regions, our author makes the\r\nfollowing reply; \"What then will our author say of the vast masses\r\nof this salt which are found with their full quantity of water of\r\ncrystallization?\"--There is in this proposition, insignificant as it may\r\nseem, a confusion of ideas, which it certainly cannot be thought worth\r\nwhile to investigate; but, so far as the doctrine of the aqueous theory\r\nmay be considered as here concerned, it will be proper that I should\r\ngive some answer to the question so triumphantly put to me.\r\n\r\nOur author is in a mistake in supposing that Dr Black had written any\r\nthing upon the subject; he had only suggested the argument of this\r\nexample of mineral alkali to me, as I have mentioned; and, the use I\r\nmade of that argument was to corroborate the example I had given of sal\r\ngem. If, therefore, our author does not deny the inference from the\r\nstate of that mineral alkali, his observation upon it must refer to\r\nsomething which this other example of his is to prove on the opposite\r\nside, or to support the aqueous instead of the igneous theory; and, this\r\nis a subject which I am always willing to examine in the most impartial\r\nmanner, having a desire to know the true effect of aqueous solution in\r\nthe consolidation of mineral bodies, and having no objection to allow it\r\nany thing which it can possibly produce, although denying that it can do\r\nevery thing, as many mineralists seem to think.\r\n\r\nThe question, with regard to this example of our author's of a mineral\r\nalkali with its water of crystallization, must be this, Whether those\r\nsaline bodies had been concreted by the evaporation of the aqueous\r\nsolvent with which they had been introduced, or by the congelation of\r\nthat saline substance from a fluid state of fusion; for, surely, we are\r\nnot to suppose those bodies to have been created in the place and state\r\nin which we find them. With regard to the evaporation or separation\r\nof the aqueous solvent, this may be easily conceived according to the\r\nigneous theory; but, the aqueous theory has not any means for the\r\nproducing of that effect in the mineral regions, which is the only place\r\nwe are here concerned with. Therefore, this example of a concreted body\r\nof salt, whatever it may prove in other respects, can neither diminish\r\nthe evidence of my Theory with regard to the igneous origin of stony\r\nsubstances, nor can it contribute to support the opposite supposition of\r\nan aqueous origin to them.\r\n\r\nBut to show how little reason our author had for exulting in that\r\nquestion which he so confidently proposed in order to defeat my\r\nargument, let us consider this matter a little farther. I will for a\r\nmoment allow the aqueous theory to have the means for separating\r\nthe water from the saline solution, and thus to concrete the saline\r\nsubstance in the bowels of the earth; this concretion then is to be\r\nexamined with a view to investigate the last state of this body, which\r\nis to inform us with regard to those mineral operations. But, our author\r\nhas not mentioned whether those masses appear to have been crystallised\r\nfrom the aqueous solution, or if they appear to have been congealed from\r\nthe melted state of their _aqueous fusion_.--Has he ever thought of\r\nthis? Now this is so material a point in the view with which that\r\nexample has been held out to us, that, without showing that this salt\r\nhad crystallised from the solution, he has no right to employ it as an\r\nexample; and if, on the other hand, it should appear to have simply\r\ncongealed from the state of aqueous fusion, then, instead of answering\r\nthe purpose for which our author gave it, it would refute his\r\nsupposition, as certainly as the example which I have given.\r\n\r\nSo far I have reasoned upon the supposition of this alkali, with its\r\nwater of crystallization, being truly a mineral concretion; but, I see\r\nno authority for such a supposition: It certainly may be otherwise;\r\nand, in that case, our author would have no more right to give it as an\r\nexample in opposition to Dr Black's argument, than he would have to give\r\nthe crystallization of sea-salt, on Turk's Island, in opposition to the\r\nexample which I had given, of the salt rock, at Northwych in Cheshire,\r\nhaving been in the state of fusion.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was incumbent on our author to have informed us, if those\r\nmasses of salt were found in, what may be properly termed, their mineral\r\nstate; or, if the state in which they are found at present had been\r\nproduced by the influences of the atmosphere, transforming that saline\r\nsubstance from its mineral state, as happens upon so many other\r\noccasions; I am inclined to suspect that this last is truly the case.\r\nIt may be thought illiberal in me to suppose a natural philosopher thus\r\nholding out an example that could only serve to lead us into error, or\r\nto mislead our judgment with regard to those two theories which is the\r\nsubject of consideration. This certainly would be the case, almost\r\non any other occasion; but, when I find every argument and example,\r\nemployed in this dissertation, to be either unfounded or misjudged,\r\nWhether am I to conclude our author, on this occasion, to be consistent\r\nwith himself, or not?\r\n\r\nI have but one article more to observe upon. I had given, as I thought,\r\na kind of demonstration, from the internal evidence of the stone, that\r\ngranite had been in the fluid state of fusion, and had concreted by\r\ncrystallization and congelation from that melted state. This no doubt\r\nmust be a stumbling block to those who maintain that granite mountains\r\nare the primitive parts of our earth; and who, like our author, suppose\r\nthat \"things may have been originally, as at present, in a solid state.\"\r\nIt must also be a great, if not an invincible obstacle in the way of the\r\naqueous theory, which thus endeavours to explain those granite veins\r\nthat are found traversing strata, and therefore necessarily of a\r\nposterior formation.\r\n\r\nTo remove that obstacle in the way of the aqueous theory, or to carry\r\nthat theory over the obstacle which he cannot remove, our author\r\nundertakes to refute my theory with regard to the igneous origin of\r\nstony substances, by giving an example of granite formed upon the\r\nsurface of the earth by means of water, or in what is called the\r\nmoist way; and he closes his Dissertation with this example as an\r\n_experimentum crucis_. It is therefore necessary that I take this\r\ndemonstration of our author into particular consideration; for, surely,\r\nindependent of our controversy, which is perhaps of little moment, here\r\nis the most interesting experiment, as it is announced, that mineralogy\r\ncould be enriched with.\r\n\r\n\"To close this controversy,\" says our author, \"I shall only add,\r\nthat granite, recently formed in the moist way, has been frequently\r\nfound.\"--Of that remarkable event, however, he has selected only one\r\nexample. This is to be found upon the Oder; and the authority upon which\r\nour author has given it, is that of Lasius Hartz.\r\n\r\nThe formation of a granite stone, from granite sand, by means of water,\r\nis inconsistent with our chemical knowledge of those mineral substances\r\nwhich constitute that stone; it is repugnant to the phenomena which\r\nappear from the inspection of the natural bodies of this kind; and it\r\nis directly contrary to the universal experience in granite countries,\r\nwhere, instead of any thing concreting, every thing is going into\r\ndecay, from the loose stones and sand of granite, to the solid rock and\r\nmountains which are always in a state of degradation. Therefore, to have\r\nany credit given to such a story, would require the most scientific\r\nevidence in its favour. Now, in order that others may judge whether this\r\nhas been the case in this example, I will transcribe what our author has\r\nsaid upon the subject; and then I will give the view in which it appears\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nHe says, \"a mole having been constructed in the Oder in the year 1723,\r\n350 feet long, 54 feet in height, 144 feet broad at bottom, and 54 at\r\nthe top, its sides only were granite, without any other cement than\r\nmoss; the middle space was entirely filled with granite sand. In a short\r\ntime this concreted into a substance so compact as to be impenetrable by\r\nwater.\"--Here is an example, according to our author, of _granite formed\r\nin the moist way_. But now, I must ask to see the evidence of that fact;\r\nfor, from what our author has told us, I do not even see reason to\r\nconclude that there was the least concretion, or any stone formed at\r\nall. A body of sand will be _so compacted as to be impenetrable by\r\nwater_, with the introduction of a very little mud, and without any\r\ndegree of concretion; muddy water, indeed, cannot be made to pass\r\nthrough such a body without compacting it so; and this every body finds,\r\nto their cost, who have attempted to make a filter of that kind.\r\n\r\nBut I shall suppose Lasius has informed our author that there had been\r\na petrifaction in this case; and, before I admit this example of the\r\nformation of granite, I must ask what sort of a granite it was;--whether\r\nof two, three, or four ingredients; and, how these were disposed. If,\r\nagain, it were not properly a granite, but a stone formed of granite\r\nsand, What is the cementing substance?--Is it quartz, felt-spar, mica,\r\nor schorl?--or, Was it calcareous? If our author knows any thing about\r\nthese necessary questions, Why has he not informed us, as minutely as\r\nhe has done with regard to the dimensions of the mole, with which we\r\ncertainly are less concerned? If, again, he knows no more about the\r\nmatter than what he has informed us of, he must have strangely imposed\r\nupon himself, to suppose that he was giving us an example of the\r\n_formation of granite in the moist way_, when he has only described an\r\neffectual way of retaining water, by means of sand and mud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nOf Physical Systems, and Geological Theories, in general.\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter I have given a general theory of the earth,\r\nwith such proofs as I thought were sufficient for the information of\r\nintelligent men, who might satisfy themselves by examining the facts on\r\nwhich the reasoning in that theory had been founded.\r\n\r\nIn the second chapter, I have endeavoured to remove the objections which\r\nhave been made to that theory, by a strenuous patron of the commonly\r\nreceived opinion of mineralogists and geologists,--an opinion which, if\r\nnot diametrically opposite, differs essentially from mine. But now I am\r\nto examine nature more particularly, in order to compare those different\r\nopinions with the actual state of things, on which every physical theory\r\nmust be founded. Therefore, the opinions of other geologists should be\r\nclearly stated, that so a fair comparison may be made of theories which\r\nare to represent the system of this earth.\r\n\r\nNow, if I am to compare that which I have given as a theory of the\r\nearth, with the theories given by others under that denomination, I\r\nfind so little similarity, in the things to be compared, that no other\r\njudgment could hence be formed, perhaps, than that they had little or no\r\nresemblance. I see certain treatises named Theories of the Earth; but, I\r\nfind not any thing that entitles them to be considered as such, unless\r\nit be their endeavouring to explain certain appearances which are\r\nobserved in the earth. That a proper theory of the earth should explain\r\nall those appearances is true; but, it does not hold, conversely, that\r\nthe explanation of an appearance should constitute a theory of the\r\nearth. So far as the theory of the earth shall be considered as the\r\nphilosophy or physical knowledge of this world, that is to say, a\r\ngeneral view of the means by which the end or purpose is attained,\r\nnothing can be properly esteemed such a theory unless it lead, in some\r\ndegree, to the forming of that general view of things. But now, let us\r\nsee what we have to examine in that respect.\r\n\r\nWe have, first, Burnet's Theory of the Earth. This surely cannot be\r\nconsidered in any other light than as a dream, formed upon the poetic\r\nfiction of a golden age, and that of iron which had succeeded it; at the\r\nsame time, there are certain appearances in the earth which would, in a\r\npartial view of things, seem to justify that imagination. In Telliamed,\r\nagain, we have a very ingenious theory, with regard to the production of\r\nthe earth above the surface of the sea, and of the origin of those\r\nland animals which now inhabit that earth. This is a theory which has\r\nsomething in it like a regular system, such as we might expect to find\r\nin nature; but, it is only a physical romance, and cannot be considered\r\nin a serious view, although apparently better founded than most of that\r\nwhich has been wrote upon the subject.\r\n\r\nWe have then a theory of a very different kind; this is that of the\r\nCount de Buffon. Here is a theory, not founded on any regular system,\r\nbut upon an irregularity of nature, or an accident supposed to have\r\nhappened to the sun. But, are we to consider as a theory of the earth,\r\nan accident by which a planetary body had been made to increase the\r\nnumber of these in the solar system? The circumvolution of a planetary\r\nbody (allowing it to have happened in that manner) cannot form the\r\nsystem of a world, such as our earth exhibits; and, in forming a theory\r\nof the earth, it is required to see the aptitude of every part of this\r\ncomplicated machine to fulfil the purpose of its intention, and not to\r\nsuppose the wise system of this world to have arisen from, the cooling\r\nof a lump of melted matter which had belonged to another body. When\r\nwe consider the power and wisdom that must have been exerted in the\r\ncontriving, creating, and maintaining this living world which sustains\r\nsuch a variety of plants and animals, the revolution of a mass of dead\r\nmatter according to the laws of projectiles, although in perfect wisdom,\r\nis but like a unite among an infinite series of ascending numbers.\r\n\r\nAfter the theory of that eloquent writer, founded on a mere accident, or\r\nrather the error of a comet which produced the beautiful system of this\r\nworld, M. de Luc, in his Theory of the earth, has given us the history\r\nof a disaster which befell this well contrived world;--a disaster which\r\ncaused the general deluge, and which, without a miracle, must have\r\nundone a system of living beings that are so well adapted to the present\r\nstate of things. But, surely, general deluges form no part of the theory\r\nof the earth; for, the purpose of this earth is evidently to maintain\r\nvegetable and animal life, and not to destroy them.\r\n\r\nBesides these imaginary great operations in the natural history of this\r\nearth, we have also certain suppositions of geologists and mineralists\r\nwith regard to the effect of water, for explaining to us the\r\nconsolidation of the loose materials of which the strata of the earth\r\nhad been composed, and also for producing every other appearance, or any\r\nwhich shall happen to occur in the examination of the earth, and require\r\nto be explained. That this is no exaggerated representation, and\r\nthat this is all we have as a theory, in the suppositions of those\r\ngeologists, will appear from the following state of the case.\r\n\r\nThey suppose water the agent employed in forming the solid bodies of the\r\nearth, and in producing those crystallised bodies which appear in\r\nthe mineral kingdom. That this is a mere supposition will appear by\r\nconsidering; first, that they do not know how this agent water is to\r\noperate in producing those effects; nor have they any direct proof\r\nof the fact which is alleged, from a very fallaceous analogy; and,\r\nsecondly, that they cannot tell us where this operation is to be\r\nperformed. They cannot say that it is in the earth above the level of\r\nthe sea: for, the same appearances are found as deep as we can examine\r\nbelow that level; besides, we see that water has the opposite effect\r\nupon the surface of the earth, through which it percolates dissolving\r\nsoluble substances, and thus resolving solid bodies in preparing soil\r\nfor plants. If, again, it be below the level of the sea, that strata of\r\nthe earth are supposed to be consolidated by the infiltration of that\r\nwater which falls from the heavens; this cannot be allowed, so far as\r\nwhatever of the earth is bibulous, in that place, must have been always\r\nfull of water, consequently cannot admit of that supposed infiltration.\r\n\r\nBut allowing those suppositions to be true, there is nothing in them\r\nlike a theory of the earth,--a theory that should bring the operations\r\nof the world into the regularity of ends and means, and, by generalizing\r\nthese regular events, show us the operation of perfect intelligence\r\nforming a design; they are only an attempt to show how certain things,\r\nwhich we see, have happened without any perceivable design, or without\r\nany farther design than this particular effect which we perceive. If we\r\nbelieve that there is almighty power, and supreme wisdom employed for\r\nsustaining that beautiful system of plants and animals which is so\r\ninteresting to us, we must certainly conclude, that the earth, on which\r\nthis system of living things depends, has been constructed on principles\r\nthat are adequate to the end proposed, and procure it a perfection which\r\nit is our business to explore. Therefore, a proper system of the earth\r\nshould lead us to see that wise contraction, by which this earth is made\r\nto answer the purpose of its intention and to preserve itself from every\r\naccident by which the design of this living world might be frustrated as\r\nthis world is an active scene, or a material machine moving in all its\r\nparts, we must see how this machine is so contrived, as either to have\r\nthose parts to move without wearing and decay, or to have those parts,\r\nwhich are wasting and decaying, again repaired.\r\n\r\nA rock or stone is not a subject that, of itself, may interest a\r\nphilosopher to study; but, when he comes to see the necessity of those\r\nhard bodies, in the constitution of this earth, or for the permanency\r\nof the land on which we dwell, and when he finds that there are means\r\nwisely provided for the renovation of this necessary decaying part, as\r\nwell as that of every other, he then, with pleasure, contemplates this\r\nmanifestation of design, and thus connects the mineral system of\r\nthis earth with that by which the heavenly bodies are made to move\r\nperpetually in their orbits. It is not, therefore, simply by seeing the\r\nconcretion of mineral bodies that a philosopher is to be gratified in\r\nhis his intellectual pursuit, but by the contemplation of that system in\r\nwhich the necessary resolution of this earth, while at present it serves\r\nthe purpose of vegetation, or the fertility of our soil, is the very\r\nmeans employed in furnishing the materials of future land.\r\n\r\nIt is such a view as this that I have endeavoured to represent in the\r\ntheory which I have given. I have there stated the present situation of\r\nthings, by which we are led to perceive a former state; and, from that\r\nnecessary progress of actual things, I have concluded a certain system\r\naccording to which things will be changed, without any accident or\r\nerror. It is by tracing this regular system in nature that a philosopher\r\nis to perceive the wisdom with which this world has been contrived; but,\r\nhe must see that wisdom founded upon the aptitude of all the parts to\r\nfulfil the intention of the design; and that intention is to be deduced\r\nfrom the end which is known to be attained. Thus we are first to reason\r\nfrom effect to cause, in seeing the order of that which has already\r\nhappened; and then, from those known causes, to reason forwards, so as\r\nto conceive that which is to come to pass in time. Such would be the\r\nphilosophy of this earth, formed by the highest generalisation\r\nof phenomena, a generalisation which had required the particular\r\ninvestigation of inductive reasoning.\r\n\r\nThat no such theory as this, founded upon water as an agent operating in\r\nthe changes of this earth, has yet appeared, will, I believe be easily\r\nallowed. With regard again to fire as an agent in the mineral operations\r\nof this earth, geologists have formed no consistent theory. They see\r\nvolcanoes in all the quarters of the globe, and from those burning\r\nmountains, they conjecture other mountains have been formed. But a\r\nburning mountain is only a matter of fact; and, they have not on this\r\nformed any general principle, for establishing what may be called a\r\ntheory of the earth. Those who have considered subterraneous fires as\r\nproducing certain effects, neither know how these have been procured,\r\nnor do they see the proper purpose for which they are employed in the\r\nsystem of this world. In this case, the agent fire is only seen as\r\na destructive element, in like manner as deluges of water have been\r\nattributed by others to changes which have happened in the natural state\r\nof things. These operations are seen only as the accidents of nature,\r\nand not as part of that design by which the earth, which is necessarily\r\nwasted in the operations of the world, is to be repaired.\r\n\r\nSo far from employing heat or subterraneous fire as an agent in the\r\nmineral operations of the earth, the volcanic philosophers do not\r\neven attempt to explain upon that principle the frequent nodules of\r\ncalcareous, zeolite, and other spatose and agaty substances, in those\r\nbasaltic bodies which they consider as lavas. Instead then of learning\r\nto see the operation of heat as a general principle of mineral\r\nconsolidation and crystallization, the volcanic philosophers endeavour\r\nto explain those particular appearances, which they think inconsistent\r\nwith fusion, by aqueous infiltration, no otherwise than other\r\nmineralists who do not admit the igneous origin of those basaltic\r\nbodies. Thus, that great agent, subterraneous heat, has never been\r\nemployed by geologists, as a general principle in the theory of the\r\nearth; it has been only considered as an occasional circumstance, or as\r\nthe accident of having certain mineral bodies, which are inflammable,\r\nkindled in the earth, without so much as seeing how that may be done.\r\n\r\nThis agent heat, then, is a new principle to be employed in forming a\r\ntheory of the earth; a principle that must have been in the constitution\r\nof this globe, when contrived to subsist as a world, and to maintain\r\na system of living bodies perpetuating their species. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to connect this great mineral principle, subterraneous fire\r\nor heat, with the other operations of the world, in forming a general\r\ntheory. For, whether we are to consider those great and constant\r\nexplosions of mineral fire as a principal agent in the design, or only\r\nas a casual event depending upon circumstances which give occasion to an\r\noperation of such magnitude, here is an object that must surely have its\r\nplace in every general theory of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn examining things which actually exist, and which have proceeded in a\r\ncertain order, it is natural to look for that which had been first; man\r\ndesires to know what had been the beginning of those things which now\r\nappear. But when, in forming a theory of the earth, a geologist shall\r\nindulge his fancy in framing, without evidence, that which had preceded\r\nthe present order of things, he then either misleads himself, or writes\r\na fable for the amusement of his reader. A theory of the earth, which\r\nhas for object truth, can have no retrospect to that which had preceded\r\nthe present order of this world; for, this order alone is what we have\r\nto reason upon; and to reason without data is nothing but delusion. A\r\ntheory, therefore, which is limited to the actual constitution of this\r\nearth, cannot be allowed to proceed one step beyond the present order of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nBut, having surveyed the order of this living world, and having\r\ninvestigated the progress of this active scene of life, death and\r\ncirculation, we find ample data on which to found a train of the most\r\nconclusive reasoning with regard to a general design. It is thus that\r\nthere is to be perceived another system of active things for the\r\ncontemplation of our mind;--things which, though not immediately within\r\nour view, are not the less certain in being out of our sight; and things\r\nwhich must necessarily be comprehended in the theory of the earth, if we\r\nare to give stability to it as a world sustaining plants and animals.\r\nThis is a mineral system, by which the decayed constitution of an earth,\r\nor fruitful surface of habitable land, may be continually renewed in\r\nproportion as it is wasted in the operations of this world.\r\n\r\nIt is in this mineral system that I have occasion to compare the\r\nexplanations, which I give of certain natural appearances, with the\r\ntheories or explanations which have been given by others, and which are\r\ngenerally received as the proper theory of those mineral operations. I\r\nam, therefore, to examine those different opinions, respecting the\r\nmeans employed by nature for producing particular appearances in the\r\nconstruction of our land, appearances which must be explained in some\r\nconsistent mineral theory.\r\n\r\nThese appearances may all be comprehended under two heads, which are now\r\nto be mentioned, in order to see the importance of their explanation, or\r\npurpose which such an explanation is to serve in a theory of the earth.\r\nThe first kind of these appearances is that of known bodies which we\r\nfind composing part of the masses of our land, bodies whose natural\r\nhistory we know, as having existed in another state previous to the\r\ncomposition of this earth where they now are found; these are the\r\nrelicts or parts of animal and vegetable bodies, and various stony\r\nsubstances broken and worn by attrition, all which had belonged to a\r\nformer earth. By means of these known objects, we are to learn a great\r\ndeal of the natural history of this earth; and, it is in tracing that\r\nhistory, from where we first perceive it, to the present state of\r\nthings, that forms the subject of a geological and mineralogical theory\r\nof this earth. But, we are more especially enabled to trace those\r\noperations of the earth, by means of the second kind of appearances,\r\nwhich are now to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThese again are the evident changes which those known bodies have\r\nundergone, and which have been induced upon such collected masses of\r\nwhich those bodies constitute a part. These changes are of three sorts;\r\n_first_, the solid state, and various degrees of it, in which we now\r\nfind those masses which had been originally formed by the collection of\r\nloose and incoherent materials; _secondly_, the subsequent changes which\r\nhave evidently happened to those consolidated masses which have been\r\nbroken and displaced, and which have had other mineral substances\r\nintroduced into those broken and disordered parts; and, _lastly_, that\r\ngreat change of situation which has happened to this compound mass\r\nformed originally at the bottom of the sea, a mass which, after being\r\nconsolidated in the mineral region, is now situated in the atmosphere\r\nabove the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nIn this manner we are led to the system of the world, or theory of the\r\nearth in general; for, that great change of situation, which our land\r\nhas undergone, cannot be considered as the work of accident, or any\r\nother than an essential part in the system of this world. It is\r\ntherefore a proper view of the necessary connection and mutual\r\ndependence of all those different systems of changing things that forms\r\nthe theory of this earth as a world, or as that active part of nature\r\nwhich the philosophy of this earth has to explore. The animal system is\r\nthe first or last of these; next comes the vegetable system, on which\r\nthe life of animals depends; then comes the system of this earth,\r\ncomposed of atmosphere, sea, and land, and comprehending the various\r\nchemical, mechanical, and meteorologically operations which take place\r\nupon that surface where vegetation must proceed; and, lastly, we have\r\nthe mineral system to contemplate, a system in which the wasting surface\r\nof the earth is employed in laying the foundation of future land within\r\nthe sea, and a system in which the mineral operations are employed in\r\nconcocting that future land.\r\n\r\nNow, such must surely be the theory of this earth, if the land is\r\ncontinually wasting in the operations of this world; for, to acknowledge\r\nthe perfection of those systems of plants and animals perpetuating their\r\nspecies, and to suppose the system of this earth on which they must\r\ndepend, to be imperfect, and in time to perish, would be to reason\r\ninconsistently or absurdly. This is the view of nature that I would wish\r\nphilosophers to take; but, there are certain prejudices of education or\r\nprepossession of opinion among them to be overcome, before they can be\r\nbrought to see those fundamental propositions,--the wasting of the land,\r\nand the necessity of its renovation by the co-operation of the mineral\r\nsystem. Let us then consider how men of science, in examining the\r\nmineral state of things, and reasoning from those appearances by which\r\nwe are to learn the physiology of this earth, have misled themselves\r\nwith regard to physical causes, and formed certain mineralogical and\r\ngeological theories, by which their judgment is so perverted, in\r\nexamining nature, as to exclude them from the proper means of correcting\r\ntheir first erroneous notions, or render them blind to the clearest\r\nevidence of any other theory that is proposed.\r\n\r\nWhen men of science reason upon subjects where the ideas are distinct\r\nand definite, with terms appropriated to the ideas, they come to\r\nconclusions in which there is no difference of opinion. It is otherwise\r\nin physical subjects, where things are to be assimilated, in being\r\nproperly compared; there, things are not always compared in similar and\r\nequal circumstances or conditions; and there, philosophers often draw\r\nconclusions beyond the analogy of the things compared, and thus judge\r\nwithout data. When, for example, they would form the physical induction,\r\nwith regard to the effect of fire or water upon certain substances in\r\nthe mineral regions, from the analogy of such events as may be observed\r\nupon the surface of the earth, they are apt to judge of things acting\r\nunder different circumstances or conditions, consequently not producing\r\nsimilar effects; in which case, they are judging without reason, that\r\nis, instead of inductive reasoning from actual data or physical truth,\r\nthey are forming data to themselves purely by supposition, consequently,\r\nso far as these, imagined data may be wrong, the physical conclusion, of\r\nthese philosophers may be erroneous.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that philosophers have judged, with regard to the effects of\r\nfire and water upon mineral substances below the bottom of the sea,\r\nfrom what their chemistry had taught them to believe concerning bodies\r\nexposed to those agents in the atmosphere or on the surface of the\r\nearth. If in those two cases the circumstances were the same, or\r\nsimilar, consequently the conditions of the action not changed, then,\r\nthe inductive reasoning, which they employ in that comparison, would be\r\njust; but, so far as it is evidently otherwise, to have employed that\r\ninductive conclusion for the explanation of mineral appearances, without\r\nhaving reason to believe that those changed circumstances of the case\r\nshould not make any difference in the action or effect, is plainly to\r\nhave transgressed the rules of scientific reasoning; consequently,\r\ninstead of being a proper physical conclusion, it is only that imperfect\r\nreasoning of the vulgar which, by comparing things not properly analysed\r\nor distinguished, is so subject to be erroneous. This vague reasoning,\r\ntherefore, cannot be admitted as a part of any geological or mineral\r\ntheory. Now I here maintain, that philosophers have judged in no other\r\nmanner than by this false analogy, when they conclude that water is the\r\nagent by which mineral concretions have been formed. But it will be\r\nproper to state more particularly the case of that misunderstanding\r\namong mineral philosophers.\r\n\r\nIn forming a geological theory, the general construction of this earth,\r\nand the materials of which it is composed, are such visible objects, and\r\nso evident to those who will take the pains to examine nature, that\r\nhere is a subject in which there cannot be any doubt or difference of\r\nopinion. Neither can there be any dispute concerning the place and\r\nsituation of mass when it was first formed or composed; for, this is\r\nclearly proved, from every concomitant circumstance, to have been at the\r\nbottom of the sea. The only question in this case, that can be made, is,\r\nHow that mass comes now to be a solid body, and above the surface of the\r\nsea in which it had been formed?\r\n\r\nWith regard to the last, the opinions of philosophers have been so\r\ndissonant, so vague, and so unreasonable, as to draw to no conclusion.\r\nSome suppose the land to be discovered by the gradual retreat of the\r\nocean, without proposing to explain to us from whence had come the known\r\nmaterials of a former earth, which compose the highest summits of the\r\nmountains in the highest continents of the earth. Others suppose the\r\nwhole of a former earth to have subsided below the bottom even of the\r\npresent sea, and together with it all the water of the former sea, from\r\nabove the summits of the present mountains, which had then been at the\r\nbottom of the former sea. The placing of the bottom of the sea, or any\r\npart of it, in the atmosphere so as to be dry land, is no doubt a great\r\noperation to be performed, and a difficult task to be explained; but\r\nthis is only an argument the more for philosophers to agree in adopting\r\nthe most reasonable means.\r\n\r\nBut though philosophers differ so widely in that point, this is not the\r\ncase with regard to the concretion of mineral bodies; here mineralists\r\nseem to be almost all of one mind, at the same time without any reason,\r\nat least, without any other reason than that false analogy which they\r\nhave inconsiderately formed from the operations of the surface of this\r\nearth. This great misunderstanding of mineralists has such an extensive\r\nand baneful effect in the judging of geological theories, that it\r\nwill be proper here to explain how that has happened, and to shew the\r\nnecessity of correcting that erroneous principle before any just opinion\r\ncan be formed upon the subject.\r\n\r\nFire and water are two great agents in the system of this earth; it is\r\ntherefore most natural to look for the operation of those agents in the\r\nchanges which are made on bodies in the mineral regions; and as the\r\nconsolidated state of those bodies, which had been collected at the\r\nbottom of the sea, may have been supposed to be induced either by\r\nfusion, or by the concretion from a solution, we are to consider how far\r\nnatural appearance lead to the conclusion of the one or other of those\r\ntwo different operations. Here, no doubt, we are to reason analogically\r\nfrom the known power and effects of those great agents; but, we must\r\ntake care not to reason from a false analogy, by misunderstanding the\r\ncircumstances of the case, or not attending to the necessary conditions\r\nin which those agents act.--We must not conclude that fire cannot burn\r\nin the mineral regions because our fires require the ventilation of the\r\natmosphere; for, besides the actual exigence of mineral fire being a\r\nnotorious matter of fact, we know that much more powerful means _may_\r\nbe employed by nature, for that mineral purpose of exciting heat, than\r\nthose which we practise.--We must not conclude that mineral marble is\r\nformed in the same manner as we see a similar stony substance produced\r\nupon the surface of the earth, unless we should have reason to suppose\r\nthe analogy to be complete. But, this is the very error into which\r\nmineral philosophers have fallen; and this is the subject which I am now\r\nto endeavour to illustrate.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which those philosophers have deceived themselves when\r\nreasoning upon the subject of mineral concretion, is this: They see,\r\nthat by means of water a stony substance is produced; and, this stony\r\nbody so much resembles mineral marble as to be hardly distinguishable in\r\ncertain cases. These mineral philosophers then, reasoning in the manner\r\nof the vulgar, or without analysing the subject to its principle,\r\nnaturally attribute the formation of the mineral marble to a cause\r\nof the same sort; and, the mineral marble being found so intimately\r\nconnected with all other mineral bodies, we must necessarily conclude,\r\nin reasoning according to the soundest principles, that all those\r\ndifferent substances had been concreted in the same manner. Thus, having\r\nonce departed one step from the path of just investigation, our physical\r\nscience is necessarily bewildered in the labyrinth of error. Let us\r\nthen, in re-examining our data, point out where lies that first devious\r\nstep which had been impregnated with fixed air, or carbonic acid gas,\r\n(as it is called), dissolves a certain portion of mild calcareous\r\nearth or marble; consequently such acidulated water, that is, water\r\nimpregnated with this gas, will, by filtrating through calcareous\r\nsubstances, become saturated with that solution of marble; and, this\r\nsolution is what is called a _petrifying water_. When this solution is\r\nexposed to the action of the atmosphere, the acid gas, by means of which\r\nthe stony substance is dissolved, evaporates from the solution, in\r\nhaving a stronger attraction for the atmospheric air; it is then that\r\nthe marble, or calcareous substance, concretes and crystallises,\r\nseparating from the water in a sparry state, and forming a very solid\r\nstone by the successive accretion from the solution, as it comes to\r\nbe exposed to the influence of the atmosphere in flowing over the\r\naccumulating body. Here is the source of their delusion; for, they do\r\nnot distinguish properly the case of this solution of a stony substance\r\nconcreting by means of the separation of its solvent, and the case of\r\nsuch a solution being in a place where that necessary condition cannot\r\nbe supposed to exist; such as, e.g., the interstices among the particles\r\nof sand, clay, etc. deposited at the bottom of the sea, and accumulated\r\nin immense stratified masses.\r\n\r\nNo example can better illustrate how pernicious it is to science to have\r\nadmitted a false principle, on which a chain of reasoning is to proceed\r\nin forming a theory. Mineral philosophers have founded their theory upon\r\nthat deceitful analogy, which they had concluded between the stalactical\r\nconcretions of petrifying waters and the marble formed in the mineral\r\nregions; thus, blinded by prejudice, they shut the door against the\r\nclearest evidence; and it is most difficult to make them see the error\r\nof their principle. But this is not to be wondered at, when we consider\r\nhow few among philosophising men remount to the first principles of\r\ntheir theory; and, unless they shall thus remount to that first step,\r\nin which the concreting operation of a dissolved stony substance\r\nis supposed to take place without the necessary conditions for the\r\npetrifying operation, it is impossible to be convinced that their\r\ntheory, thus formed with regard to mineral concretion, is merely\r\nsupposition, and has no foundation in matter of fact from whence it\r\nshould proceed.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all; for, even supposing their theory to be well founded\r\nand just, it is plainly contradicted by natural appearances. According\r\nto that theory of aqueous consolidation, all the stratified bodies, of\r\nwhich this earth in general consists, should be found in the natural\r\norder of their regular formation; but, instead of this, they are found\r\nevery where disturbed in that order more or less; in many places this\r\norder and regularity is so disturbed as hardly to be acknowledged; in\r\nmost places we find those stratified bodies broken, dislocated, and\r\ncontorted, and this aqueous theory of mineralists has neither the means\r\nfor attaining that end, were it required in their theory, nor have they\r\nany such purpose in their theory, were that end attainable by the means\r\nwhich they employ. Thus blinded by the prejudice of a false analogy,\r\nthey do not even endeavour to gratify the human understanding (which\r\nnaturally goes in quest of wisdom and design) by forming a hypothetical\r\nor specious theory of the mineral system; and they only amuse themselves\r\nwith the supposition of an unknown operation of water for the\r\nexplanation of their cabinet specimens, a supposition altogether\r\nineffectual for the purpose of forming a habitable earth, and a\r\nsupposition which is certainly contradicted by every natural appearance.\r\n\r\nThus, in examining geological and mineralogical theories, I am laid\r\nunder the disagreeable necessity of pointing out the errors of physical\r\nprinciples which are assumed, the prejudices of theoretical opinions\r\nwhich have been received, and the misconceived notions which\r\nphilosophers entertain with regard to the system of nature, in which may\r\nbe perceived no ineffectual operation, nor any destructive intention,\r\nbut the wise and benevolent purpose of preserving the present order of\r\nthis world. But, though thus misled with regard to the cause of things,\r\nnaturalists are every where making interesting observations in the\r\nmineral kingdom, I shall therefore avail myself of that instructive\r\ninformation, for the confirmation of my theory.\r\n\r\nIt may now be proper to consider what must be required, in order to have\r\na geological and mineral theory established upon scientific principles,\r\nor on such grounds as must give conviction to those who will examine\r\nthe subject; for, unless we may clearly see that there are means for\r\nattaining that desirable end, few philosophers will be persuaded to\r\npursue this branch of knowledge.\r\n\r\nA theory is nothing but the generalization of particular facts; and, in\r\na theory of the earth, those facts must be taken from the observations\r\nof natural history. Nature is considered as absolutely true; no error or\r\ncontradiction can be found in nature. For, if such contradiction were\r\ntruly found, if the stone, for example, which fell to day were to rise\r\nagain to-morrow, there would be an end of natural philosophy, our\r\nprinciples would fail, and we would no longer investigate the rules of\r\nnature from our observations.\r\n\r\nEvery natural appearance, therefore, which is explained, _i.e._ which is\r\nmade to come into the order of things that happen, must so far confirm\r\nthe theory to which it then belongs. But is it necessary, that every\r\nparticular appearance, among minerals, should be thus explained in\r\na general theory of the earth? And, is any appearance, which is not\r\nexplained by it, to be considered as sufficient to discredit or confute\r\na theory which corresponded with every other appearance? Here is a\r\nquestion which it would require some accuracy to resolve.\r\n\r\nIf we knew all the powers of nature, and all the different conditions in\r\nwhich those powers may have their action varied, that is to say, if we\r\nwere acquainted with every physical cause, then every natural effect, or\r\nall appearances upon the surface of this earth, might be explained in a\r\ntheory that were just. But, seeing that this is far from being the case,\r\nand that there may be many causes of which we are as yet ignorant, as\r\nwell as certain conditions in which the known action of powers may be\r\nvaried, it must be evident, that a theory of the earth is not to be\r\nconfuted by this argument alone, That there are, among natural bodies,\r\ncertain appearances which are not explained by the theory. We must\r\nadmit, that, not having all the data which natural philosophy requires,\r\nwe cannot pretend to explain every thing which appears; and that our\r\ntheories, which necessarily are imperfect, are not to be considered as\r\nerroneous when not explaining every thing which is in nature, but only\r\nwhen they are found contrary to or inconsistent with the laws of nature,\r\nwhich are known, and with which the case in question may be properly\r\ncompared.\r\n\r\nBut we may have different theories to compare with nature; and, in that\r\ncase, the question is not, How far any of those theories should explain\r\nall natural appearances? but, How far any one particular theory might\r\nexplain a phenomenon better than another? In this case of comparison, it\r\nwill be evident, that if one theory explains natural appearances, then\r\nthe opposite to that theory cannot be supposed to explain the same\r\nappearances. If for example, granite, porphyry, or basaltes, should be\r\nfound naturally formed by fusion, the formation of those stones could\r\nnot be supposed in any case as formed by water, although it could not\r\nbe demonstrated that water is incapable of forming those mineral\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, if those three bodies were proved to have been actually\r\nformed by water alone, then, in other cases where we should have no\r\nproof, they could not be supposed as having been formed by fire or\r\nfusion. It must be evident, that an equal degree of proof of those two\r\ndifferent propositions would leave our judgment in suspence, unless that\r\nproof were perfect, in which case, we would have two different causes\r\nproducing similar effects. But, if we shall have a sufficient proof\r\nupon the one side, and only a presumptive proof or probability upon the\r\nother, we must reject that probability or presumption, when opposed by\r\na proof, although that proof were only an induction by reasoning from\r\nsimilar effects as following similar causes. _A fortiori_, if there be\r\non one side a fair induction, without the least suspicion of error,\r\nand on the other nothing but a mere presumption founded upon a distant\r\nanalogy, which could not even properly apply, then, the inductive proof\r\nwould be as satisfactory as if there had not been any supposition on the\r\nopposite side.\r\n\r\nSo far as a theory is formed in the generalization of natural\r\nappearances, that theory must be just, although it may not be perfect,\r\nas having comprehended every appearance; that is to say, a theory is\r\nnot perfect until it be founded upon every natural appearance; in which\r\ncase, those appearances will be explained by the theory. The theory of\r\ngravitation, though no ways doubtful, was not so perfect before the\r\nshape of this globe had been determined by actual measurement, and\r\nbefore the direction of the plummet had been tried upon Shihallion, as\r\nafter those observations had been made. But a theory which should be\r\nmerely hypothetical, or founded upon a few appearances, can only be\r\nreceived as a theory, after it has been found to correspond properly\r\nwith nature; it would then be held a proper explanation of those natural\r\nappearances with which it corresponded; and, the more of those phenomena\r\nthat were thus explained by the theory, the more would that, which had\r\nbeen first conjectural, be converted into a theory legitimately founded\r\nupon natural appearances.\r\n\r\nMatter of fact is that upon which science proceeds, by generalization,\r\nto form theory, for the purpose of philosophy, or the knowledge of all\r\nnatural causes; and it is by the companion of these matters of fact with\r\nany theory, that such a theory will be tried. But, in judging of matter\r\nof fact, let us be cautious of deceiving ourselves, by substituting\r\nspeculative reasoning in place of actual events.\r\n\r\nNature, as the subject of our observation, consists of two sorts of\r\nobjects; for, things are either active, when we perceive change to take\r\nplace in consequence of such action, or they are quiescent, when we\r\nperceive no change to take place. Now, it is evident, that in judging\r\nof the active powers of nature from the quiescent objects of our\r\ninformation, we are liable to error, in misinterpreting the objects\r\nwhich we see; we thus form to ourselves false or erroneous opinion\r\nconcerning the general laws of action, and the powers of nature. In\r\ncomparing, therefore, generalised facts, or theory, with particular\r\nobservations, there is required the greatest care, neither, on the one\r\nhand, to strain the appearances, so as to bring in to the theory a fact\r\nbelonging to another class of things; nor, on the other, to condemn a\r\nproper theory, merely because that theory has not been extended to the\r\nexplanation of every natural appearance.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the misinterpretation of matters of fact, we are also to\r\nguard against the misrepresentation of natural appearances. Whether\r\nwarped by the prejudice of partial and erroneous theory, or deceived by\r\nthe inaccuracy of superficial observation, naturalists are apt to see\r\nthings in an improper light, and thus to reason from principles which\r\ncannot be admitted, and, which often lead to false conclusions. A\r\nnaturalist, for example, comes to examine a cavity in the mines, he\r\nthere finds water dropping down all around him, and he sees the cavity\r\nall hung with siliceous crystals; he then concludes, without hesitation,\r\nthat here is to be perceived cause and effect, or that he actually sees\r\nthe formation of those crystallizations from the operation of water. It\r\nis thus that I have been told by men of great mineral knowledge, men who\r\nmust have had the best education upon that subject of mineralogy, and\r\nwho have the superintendance of great mineral concerns in Germany, that\r\nthey had actually seen nature at work in that operation of forming\r\nrock-crystal;--they saw what I have now described; they could see no\r\nmore; but, they saw what had convinced them of that which, there is\r\nevery reason to believe, never happened. With regard to my theory,\r\nI wish for the most rigorous examination; and do not ask for any\r\nindulgence whatever, whether with regard to the principles on which the\r\ntheory is built, or for the application of the theory to the explanation\r\nof natural appearances. But, let not geologists judge my theory by their\r\nimperfect notions of nature, or by those narrow views which they take of\r\nthe present state of things;--let not mineralogists condemn my theory,\r\nfor no other reason but because it does not correspond with their false\r\nprinciples, and those gratuitous suppositions by which they had been\r\npleased to explain to themselves every thing before. First let them look\r\ninto their own theory, and correct that erroneous principle, with regard\r\nto the action of water, or the assumption of unknown causes, upon which\r\nthey have reasoned in forming their vague notions of the mineral region,\r\nbefore they can be properly qualified to examine, impartially, a theory\r\nwhich employs another principle. Every thing which has come under my\r\nobservation shall be, as far as I can, faithfully related; nor shall I\r\nwithhold those which neither the present theory, nor any other that I am\r\nacquainted with, can, I think, explain.\r\n\r\nAppearances cannot well be described except in relation to some theory\r\nor general arrangement of the subject; because the particular detail,\r\nof every part in a complicated appearance, would be endless and\r\ninsignificant. When, however, any question in a theory depends upon the\r\nnature of an appearance, we cannot be too particular in describing that\r\nby which the question is to be decided. But though it be sometimes\r\nproper to be minute in a particular, it is always, and above all things,\r\nnecessary to be distinct; and not to confound together things which are\r\nof different natures. For, though it be by finding similarity, in things\r\nwhich at first sight may seem different, that science is promoted and\r\nphilosophy attained, yet, we must have a distinct view of those things\r\nwhich are to be assimilated; and surely the lowest state of knowledge\r\nin any subject, is the not distinguishing things which, though not to\r\ncommon observation different, are not truly the same.\r\n\r\nTo confound, for example one stone with another, because they were both\r\nhard, friable, and heavy, would be to describe, with the superficial\r\nviews of vulgar observation; whereas science specifies the weight and\r\nhardness, and thus accurately distinguishes the stone.\r\n\r\nBefore naturalists had learned to distinguish what they saw, and to\r\ndescribe, in known terms, those natural appearances, a theorist must\r\nhave generalised only from his proper observation. This has been my\r\ncase. When I first conceived my theory, few naturalists could write\r\nintelligibly upon the subject; but that is long ago, and things are much\r\naltered since; now there are most enlightened men making observations,\r\nand communicating natural knowledge. I have the satisfaction, almost\r\nevery day, to compare the theory, which I had formed from my proper\r\nobservations, with the actual state of things in almost every quarter of\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nWhether, therefore, we mean to try a theory by its application to\r\nsuch phenomena as are well understood, or to learn something from the\r\napplication of particular phenomena to a well established theory,\r\nwe shall always find it interesting to have appearances described;\r\nparticularly such as may be referred to some general rule, as\r\ncircumscribing it to certain conditions, or as finding rule in rule,\r\nthat is to say, discovering those particular conditions in which the\r\ngeneral laws of action may be affected.\r\n\r\nInstead, for example, of the rule which we find in the application of\r\nheat for the fusion and evaporation of mineral substances upon the\r\nsurface of this earth, we may find it necessary to consider the effect\r\nwhich changed circumstances produce in the mineral regions, and occasion\r\na change of that rule of action which we have learned from experience,\r\nwhen melting and evaporating those substances in the atmosphere or on\r\nthe surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is in this manner that a theory, which was formed by the\r\ngeneralization of particular facts, comes to be a source of information,\r\nby explaining to us certain appearances which otherwise we could not\r\nunderstand. Thus, it was not the appearance of the tides that taught the\r\ntheory of gravitation; it was the theory of gravitation that made us\r\nunderstand the appearance of the tides. In like manner, the law of\r\ngravitation, which was demonstrated from the motion of the moon in her\r\norbit round this earth, when applied to the paths of comets, explained\r\nthat appearance. Our theory, of a central fire, has been formed upon\r\nthe consolidation of the strata of this earth; but this theory is to be\r\napplied for the explanation of various different appearances. In this\r\nmanner, two different purposes will be served; the trying of the theory\r\nby its application to phenomena; and the explanation of phenomena by the\r\nprinciples laid open in the theory.\r\n\r\nI may repeat it; a theory of the earth must ultimately depend upon\r\nmatter of fact or particular observation; but those observations must be\r\ndistinct, and those distinguished things must be generalised. We have\r\njust now given for an example, a distinction among stones, in knowing\r\nthem by their sensible qualities. But, besides distinguishing those\r\nobjects, we are also to inquire into the origin and cause of those\r\nthings which are distinguished. Here, again, we take into our aid the\r\nchemical as well as the mechanical properties of these several things;\r\nand hence learn to know on what their natural form and constitution may\r\ndepend. Having thus attained the natural philosophy of stones, we next\r\ninquire into the place and application of those things in nature; and\r\nin this manner we acquire some knowledge with regard to the natural\r\nconstitution of this earth. We find this earth composed of known things;\r\nit is therefore the operations, required in these compositions, which\r\nform the natural philosophy of this earth, considered as a body of solid\r\nland. But, the solid land is only one part of the globe; therefore,\r\nthe philosophy of the globe proceeds still farther by knowing the\r\nconstitution of this planetary body, as consisting of different parts\r\nunited for a purpose, which is that of a world.\r\n\r\nThe general theory of this earth as a world, will thus appear to be a\r\ncomplex thing, which however founded upon simple principles, contains\r\nmany subjects of discussion, and requires attention to a variety of\r\nparticulars. For, not only the great features of this earth are to be\r\nexplained by the theory, but also the most minute appearance, such as\r\nare to be found, even with microscopic observation, in every particular\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThus the nature, constitution, and cause of every particular appearance\r\nin the construction of this earth, are to be investigated in a\r\ngeological theory, as well as that general constitution of the world in\r\nwhich all the particular parts are to be employed for a purpose.\r\n\r\nIf the subject here examined shall be found properly explained, there\r\nwill remain little doubt with regard to the justness of the theory,\r\nwhich will then be applicable to other appearances that may occur;\r\nalthough every appearance is not to be explained, in a manner equally\r\nsatisfactory, by any theory which is not perfect.\r\n\r\nThe first subject to be examined is the modern theory of primitive\r\nmountains. I have written several chapters upon that subject, having\r\nsuccessively acquired more light in this interesting part of the theory,\r\nby observations of my own in several places of this country, as well as\r\nfrom the natural history of other countries. I shall give these nearly\r\nin the order in which they occurred, or had been written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nThe Supposition of Primitive Mountains refuted.\r\n\r\nIn the theory now given, the earth has been represented as a composition\r\nof different materials, which had existed in another form, and as the\r\neffect of natural operations; therefore, however various may be found\r\nthe structure of our earth, and however dissimilar some parts of\r\nits composition may be in comparison with others, no part should be\r\nconsidered as original, in relation to the globe, or as primitive, in\r\nrelation to second causes, _i.e._ physical operations by which those\r\nparts should have been formed. But it is pretended by naturalists, that\r\nthere are certain primitive mountains in the earth, bodies which have\r\nhad another origin than that of the general strata of the globe and\r\nsubsequent masses; an origin, therefore, which cannot be considered as\r\nhaving been produced from natural operations, or as effected in the\r\ncourse of known causes. Now, if it can be made to appear, that there is\r\nno solid ground for this distinction; and if it can be shown, that there\r\nis truly no mineral body in this earth which may not have been produced\r\nby operations natural to the globe, we should thus procure a certain\r\nconfirmation of the doctrine. This also will be the more interesting,\r\nin being deduced from a part of natural appearances, which seemed to be\r\ninconsistent with the theory.\r\n\r\nCertain masses or mountains of granite, are the only bodies of this\r\nearth which have apparently a certain pretension to this species\r\nof originality. These, therefore, must be now the subject of our\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nGranite, considered by itself, does not appear to have any claim to\r\noriginality in its nature. It is composed of bodies which are capable of\r\nbeing analyzed; and these are then found to be compositions of different\r\nsubstances, which are also sometimes variously proportioned. The\r\nfeldspar and the mica, for example, as well as the schorl, are found\r\nvariously coloured in different granites, and coloured in various\r\nproportions. Besides the variety in the composition, or chemical mixture\r\nof the different bodies which compose granite, this rock admits of a\r\ngreat diversity, from the variety of its mechanical mixture, or from\r\nthe different species of bodies which are its constituent parts. M. de\r\nSaussure, who has examined this subject perhaps more than any other\r\nperson, and who has had the very best opportunities for this purpose,\r\nsays, that this composition may be found in all the different\r\ncombinations which may be produced by every possible composition of 7\r\nor 8 different kinds of stone, (page 108, Voyage dans les Alpes, etc.).\r\nNeither does this fill up the measure of its variety; for, another\r\nsource of change is found in the grain of this rock stone; I have a\r\nspecimen of this variety from the size almost of sand to that of some\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nWere granite, therefore, to be supposed as in the original state of its\r\ncreation, nature would be considered as having operated in an indefinite\r\ndiversity of ways, without that order and wisdom which we find in all\r\nher works; for here would be change without a principle, and variety\r\nwithout a purpose. There is no reason, however, to suppose granite\r\noriginal, more than any other composite rock, although we may be\r\nignorant of the particular process in which it is formed, and although,\r\ncomparatively in relation to certain other rocks, granite, or certain\r\nmasses of this composition, may be found of a more ancient date.\r\n\r\nIf granite be truly stratified, and those strata connected with the\r\nother strata of the earth, it can have no claim to originality; and\r\nthe idea of primitive mountains, of late so much employed by natural\r\nphilosophers, must vanish, in a more extensive view of the operations of\r\nthe globe; but it is certain that granite, or a species of the same kind\r\nof stone, is thus found stratified. It is the _granit feuilletée_ of\r\nM. de Saussure, and, if I mistake not, what is called _gneis_ by the\r\nGermans. We have it also in our north alpine country of Scotland; of\r\nthis I have specimens, but have not seen it in its place.\r\n\r\nGranite being thus found stratified, the masses of this stone cannot be\r\nallowed to have any right of priority over the schistus, its companion\r\nin the alpine countries, although M. de Saussure, whose authority I\r\nwould revere, has given it for the following reason; that it is found\r\nthe most centrical in the chains of high mountains, or in alpine\r\ncountries. Now, supposing this fact to be general, as he has found it in\r\nthe Alps, no argument for the priority of those masses can be founded\r\neither upon the height or the situation of those granite mountains; for\r\nthe height of the mountain depends upon the solidity and strength of the\r\nstone. Now though it is not to be here maintained that granite is the\r\nmost durable of those alpine rocks, yet as a mountain, either granite in\r\ngeneral, or in particular, certain species of it, may be esteemed such,\r\nconsequently, this massy stone, remaining highest in the mountainous\r\nregion, will naturally be considered as the centre, and according to\r\nthis rule, as having the pre-eminence in point of seniority.\r\n\r\nThe rock which stands in competition with granite for the title of\r\nprimitive in the order of mountains, is that micaceous stratified stone\r\nwhich is formed chiefly of quartz, but which admits of great variety\r\nlike the granite. The difference between those two bodies does not\r\nconsist in the materials of which they are composed, for, in their\r\nvarieties, they may be in this respect the same, but in a certain\r\nregularity of composition, in this alpine stone, which evidently arises\r\nfrom stratification or subsidence in water.\r\n\r\nIf we shall thus consider all the varieties of this alpine stone as\r\nbeing of one kind, and call it granite, then we shall distinguish in\r\nthis body two different species, from whence perhaps some interesting\r\nconclusion may be formed with regard to the operations of the globe.\r\nThese two species are, _first_, granite regular in its composition, or\r\nstratified in its construction; and, _secondly_, granite in mass, or\r\nirregular in its construction. Let us now endeavour to make use of these\r\ngeneralizations and distinctions.\r\n\r\nIn examining the great diversity of our whinstone, trap, or basaltes, it\r\nis found at last to granulate into granite; at the same time those two\r\ndifferent species of rock-stone may be distinguished. A perfect granite\r\nhas not in its composition necessarily any argillaceous earth, farther\r\nthan may be in the natural constitution of its distinct parts; whereas,\r\na perfect basalt may have abundance of this substance, without any\r\nquartz or any siliceous body. A perfect granite, is, therefore, an\r\nextremely hard stone, having quartz and feldspar for its basis; but a\r\nperfect whin or basaltes may be extremely soft, so as to cut easily with\r\na knife. In like manner granite is a composition which graduates into\r\nporphyry; but porphyry is only whinstone of a harder species. Therefore,\r\nthough perfectly distinct, those three things graduate into each other,\r\nand may be considered as the same.\r\n\r\nGranite and whinstone, or basaltes, though distinct compositions, thus\r\ngraduating into each other; and whinstone, as well as porphyry, being\r\nwithout doubt a species of lava, we may consider the granite which is\r\nfound in mass without stratification, in like manner as we do the masses\r\nof whinstone, basaltes, or Swedish trap, as having flowed in the bowels\r\nof the earth, and thus been produced by the chance of place, without any\r\nproper form of its own, or in an irregular shape and construction. In\r\nthis manner would be explained the irregular shape or structure of those\r\ngranite masses; and thus great light would be thrown upon the waved\r\nstructure of the stratified alpine stone, which, though it has not been\r\nmade to flow, has been brought to a great degree of softness, so as to\r\nhave the original straight lines of its stratification changed to\r\nthose undulated or waving lines which are in some cases extremely much\r\nincurvated.\r\n\r\nIt remains only to confirm this reasoning, upon our principles, by\r\nbringing actual observation to its support; and this we shall do from\r\ntwo of the best authorities. The Chevalier de Dolomieu, in describing\r\nthe volcanic productions of Etna, mentions a lava which had flowed from\r\nthat mountain, and which may be considered as a granite. But M. de\r\nSaussure has put this matter out of doubt by describing most accurately\r\nwhat he had seen both in the Alps and at the city of Lyons. These are\r\nveins of granite which have flowed from the contiguous mass into the\r\nstratified stone, and leave no doubt with regard to this proposition,\r\nthat the granite had flowed in form of subterranean lava, although M. de\r\nSaussure has drawn a very different conclusion from this appearance. I\r\nhave also a specimen from this country of a vein of granite in a granite\r\nstone, the vein being of a smaller grain than that of the rock which it\r\ntraverses.[20]\r\n\r\n[Note 20: This is what I had wrote upon, the subject of granite, before\r\nI had acquired such ample testimony from my own observations upon\r\nthat species of rock. I have given some notice, in the 3d vol. of the\r\nTransactions of the Edinburgh R.S. concerning the general result of\r\nthose observations, which will be given particularly in the course of\r\nthis work.]\r\n\r\nIt will thus appear, that the doctrine which of late has prevailed, of\r\nprimitive mountains, or something which should be considered as original\r\nin the construction of this earth, must be given up as a false view of\r\nnature, which has formed the granite upon the same principle with that\r\nof any other consolidated stratum; so far as the collection of different\r\nmaterials, and the subsequent fusion of the compound mass, are necessary\r\noperations in the preparation of all the solid masses of the earth.\r\nWhatever operations of the globe, therefore, may be concluded from the\r\ncomposition of granite masses, as well as of the alpine strata, these\r\nmust be considered as giving us information with regard to the natural\r\nhistory of this earth; and they will be considered as important, in\r\nproportion as they disclose to us truths, which from other strata might\r\nnot be so evident, or at all made known.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the arguments, which, may be employed in favour of\r\nthat supposition of primitive mountains.\r\n\r\nThe observations, on which naturalists have founded that opinion of\r\noriginality in some of the component parts of our earth, are these;\r\n_first_, They observe certain great masses of granite in which\r\nstratification is not to be perceived; this then they say is an original\r\nmass, and it is not to be derived from any natural operation of the\r\nglobe; _secondly_, They observe considerable tracts of the earth\r\ncomposed of matter in the order of stratification as to its general\r\ncomposition, but not as to its particular position, the vertical\r\nposition here prevailing, instead of the horizontal which is proper to\r\nstrata formed in water; this, therefore, they also term primitive, and\r\nsuppose it to be from another origin than that of the subsidence of\r\nmaterials moved in the waters of the globe; _lastly_, They observe both\r\nstrata and masses of calcareous matter in which they cannot distinguish\r\nany marine body as is usual in other strata of the same substance; and\r\nthese calcareous masses being generally connected with their primitive\r\nmountains, they have also included these collections of calcareous\r\nmatter, in which marine bodies are not observed, among the primitive\r\nparts which they suppose to be the original construction of this globe.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to see the description of a calcareous alpine mountain.\r\nM. de Saussure gives us the following observations concerning a mountain\r\nof this kind in the middle of the Alps, where the water divides in\r\nrunning different ways towards the sea. It is in describing the passage\r\nof the Bon-Homme, (Tom. 2. V. dans les Alpes).\r\n\r\n\"§ 759. Sur la droite ou au couchant de ces rochers, on voit une\r\nmontagne calcaire étonnante dans ce genre par la hardiesse avec laquelle\r\nelle élève contre le ciel ses cimes aigues et tranchantes, taillées\r\nà angles vifs dans le costume des hautes cimes de granit. Elle est\r\npourtant bien sûrement calcaire, je l'ai observée de près, et on\r\nrencontre sur cette route les blocs qui s'en détachent.\r\n\r\n\"Cette pierre porte les caractères des calcaires les plus anciennes; sa\r\ncouleur est grise, son grain assez fin, on n'y apperçoit aucun vestige\r\nde corps organisés; ses couches sont peu épaisses, ondées et coupées\r\nfréquemment par des fentes parallèles entr'elles et perpendiculaires à\r\nleurs plans. On trouve aussi parmi ces fragmens des brèches calcaires\r\ngrises.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a mountain which will rank with the most primitive of the earth;\r\nBut why? only because it is extremely consolidated without any mark of\r\norganised body. Had there been in this mountain but one single shell, we\r\nshould not then have scrupled to conclude that the origin of this lofty\r\nmountain had been the same with every marble or limestone in the earth.\r\nBut though, from the structure of this stone, there is no mark of its\r\nhaving been formed immediately of the calcareous parts of animals, there\r\nis every mark of those calcareous strata having been formed like other\r\nmarbles by deposit in the waters of the globe.\r\n\r\nThese two things are also homologated by the equal or perfect\r\nconsolidation of their substance; for, as it is to be proved that\r\nall stratified marbles have been consolidated by the fusion of their\r\nsubstance, we must attribute the same consolidating cause to those\r\nalpine masses; the frequent veins that divide those calcareous strata\r\nwhich M. de Saussure has here described, also prove the nature of the\r\nconsolidating cause, (see Chap. 1. page 111.).\r\n\r\nThis mountain, considered by itself, may perhaps afford no data by which\r\na naturalist might read the circumstances of its origin. But, Is a\r\ntheory of the earth to be formed upon such a negative observation? and,\r\nIs there any particular in this mountain, that may not be shown in\r\nothers of which the origin is not in any degree doubtful?\r\n\r\nIt is not to be disputed, that there are parts of the solid body of our\r\nearth which may be considered as primary or prior, compared with others\r\nthat are posterior, in relation to the time of their formation, and much\r\nless changed with regard to the state in which they had been originally\r\nformed:--But it is here denied, that there are any parts of the earth\r\nwhich do not appear to have had the same origin with all the rest, so\r\nfar as this consists in the collection of materials deposited at the\r\nbottom of the waters[21]; for there is no solid mass of land that may\r\nnot be traced to this origin, either from its composition, or from its\r\nlocal connection with other masses, the nature of which in this respect\r\nare known. We have already given examples of this from sufficient\r\nauthority. The evidence, therefore, of those primary masses being\r\noriginal in relation to the natural operations of the globe, is reduced\r\nto this assertion, that there are no vestiges of organised bodies to be\r\nfound in those primary masses. Let us now examine how far this testimony\r\nfor the originality of those masses is to be admitted in fact and sound\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\n[Note 21: There are no collection of those alpine masses in which may\r\nnot be found in some of them sand, mica, and gravel; but these materials\r\nprove the existence of an earth, on which those fragments of greater\r\nmasses had been formed, and more or less worn by attrition.]\r\n\r\nThe matter in question at present is this, that there are certain tracts\r\nof countries in which no vestige of organised bodies are found; now, let\r\nus suppose the fact to be true or well grounded, Can we conclude\r\nfrom this that there had been originally no organised bodies in the\r\ncomposition of those masses?--Such a conclusion could only be formed in\r\nmaking a supposition, that every organised body deposited in a mass\r\nof matter, whether homogeneous or heterogeneous, should be preserved\r\nwithout change, while the collected mass, in which it had been\r\ndeposited, changes as much as possible by the operation both of fire and\r\nwater. But this supposition is erroneous, and cannot be admitted; and\r\nthe study of marbles will demonstrate this truth, that the calcareous\r\nrelics of organised bodies are changed, in the consolidating operations\r\nof the globe, in every degree, from the smallest alteration to the\r\ngreatest, when they become indistinguishable any farther to our sight.\r\n\r\nTherefore, from the supposition of no appearance of marine bodies in the\r\npretended primitive masses, there is no sufficient evidence or reason to\r\nconclude, that those masses have not had a marine origin; because, the\r\ntraces of organised bodies may be obliterated by the many subsequent\r\noperations of the mineral region; and which operations, the present\r\nstate of those masses certify beyond dispute.\r\n\r\nWe are now to examine the fact, how far the ground on which that false\r\nreasoning had been founded is strictly true.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, it must be considered, that the alledged fact\r\nis nothing but a negative assertion, importing that no mark of organised\r\nbodies had been observed, in certain stones and strata which some\r\nnaturalists have examined with that view. But, though many naturalists\r\nhave looked for them without success, it does not follow that such marks\r\nmay not be found; it indeed proves that such a task is difficult, and\r\nthe success of it, to a particular, most precarious; accident, however,\r\nmay bring about what the greatest industry has not been able to attain.\r\nSecondly, there is good reason to believe that this asserted negation\r\nis not absolutely true; for I have in my possession what I consider as\r\nproof of the contrary; I found it in Wales, and I think it is in what\r\nmay be considered as primitive mountains;--it is the mark of shells in a\r\nstone of that kind.\r\n\r\nThus, I had formed my opinion with regard to this alleged fact, long\r\nbefore I had seen any description either of the Alps or Pyrennean\r\nmountains; and now I have no reason to change that opinion. It may\r\nindeed be alleged, that the strata of marble or limestone, containing\r\nmarine bodies found in those mountains, are secondary strata, and not\r\nthe primitive. To this I can give no reply, as the descriptions given of\r\nthose strata do not enable me to decide this point.\r\n\r\nAt the village of Mat, under the Mont Blatten for example, there is a\r\nquarry of schistus or black slate, in which are often found the print\r\nand the bones of fishes. (Discours sur l'Histoire Naturelle de la\r\nSuisse, page 225.). If this may be considered as an alpine or primitive\r\nschistus, it would be decisive of the question: But it would require to\r\nhave it well ascertained that this schistus is truly one of those which\r\nare esteemed primitive, or that it is properly connected with them.\r\n\r\nBut though I cannot find in those interesting descriptions which we now\r\nhave got, any one which is demonstrative of this truth, that calcareous\r\nmarine objects are found in the primitive strata, this is not the\r\ncase with regard to another object equally important in deciding this\r\nquestion, Whether the primitive strata are found containing the marks of\r\norganised bodies?\r\n\r\nM. de Dellancourt, in his _Observations Minéralogiques_, Journal de\r\nPhysique Juillet 1786, in describing the mountains of Dauphiné, gives us\r\nthe following fact with regard to those alpine vertical strata.\r\n\r\n\"La pierre constituante de la montagne d'Oris est en général le _Kneifs_\r\nou la roche feuilletée mica et quartz à couches plus ou moins ferrées\r\nquelquefois le schorl en roche pénétré de stéatite. Les couches varient\r\ninfiniment quant à leur direction et à leur inclinaisons. Cette montagne\r\nest cultivée et riche dans certain cantons, surtout autour du village\r\nd'Oris, mais elle est très-escarpée dans beaucoup d'autres. Entre le\r\nvillage d'Oris et celui du Tresnay est une espèce de combe assez creuse\r\nformée par la chute des eaux des cimes supérieures des rochers. Cette\r\ncombe offre beaucoup de schiste dont les couches font ou très-inclinées\r\nou perpendiculaires. Entre ces couches il s'en est trouvé de plus noires\r\nque les autres et capable de brûler, mais difficilement. Les habitans\r\nont extrait beaucoup de cette matière terreuse, et lui ont donné le nom\r\nde charbon de terre. Ils viennent même à bout de la faire brûler, et\r\nde s'en servir l'hiver en la mêlant avec du bois. Ce schiste noir\r\nparticulier m'a paru exister principalement dans les endroits ou les\r\neaux se sont infiltrées entre les couches perpendiculaires, et y ont\r\nentraîné diverse matières, et sur-tout des débris de végétaux que\r\nj'ai encore retrouvés à demi-noirs, pulvérulens et comme dans un état\r\ncharbonneux.\"\r\n\r\nThis formation of coal, by the infiltration of water and carrying in of\r\nvegetable bodies, certainly cannot be admitted of; consequently, from\r\nthis description, there would seem to be strata of coal alternated with\r\nthe alpine schisti. But the formation of mineral coal requires vegetable\r\nmatter to have been deposited along with those earthy substances, at the\r\nbottom of the sea. The production of vegetable bodies, again, requires\r\nthe constitution of sea and land, and the system of a living world,\r\nsustaining plants at least, if not animals.\r\n\r\nIn this natural history of the alpine schisti, therefore, we have a\r\nmost interesting fact, an example which is extremely rare. Seldom are\r\ncalcareous organised bodies found among those alpine strata, but still\r\nmore rarely, I believe, are the marks of vegetable bodies having\r\ncontributed in the formation of those masses. But however rare this\r\nexample, it is equally decisive of the question, Whether the alpine\r\nschisti have had a similar origin as the other strata of the globe,\r\nin which are found abundance of animal and vegetable bodies, or their\r\nrelics? and we are authorised to say, that since those perfect alpine\r\nstrata of Dauphiné have had that origin, all the alpine schisti of the\r\nglobe have been originally formed in a similar manner. But to put this\r\nmatter out of doubt:\r\n\r\nIn this summer 1788, coming from the Isle of Man, Mr Clerk and I\r\ntraveled through the alpine schistus country of Cumberland and\r\nWestmoreland. We found a limestone quarry upon the banks of Windermere,\r\nnear the Low-wood Inn. I examined this limestone closely, but despaired\r\nof finding any vestige of organised body. The strata of limestone\r\nseem to graduate into the slate or schistus strata, between which the\r\ncalcareous are placed. Fortunately, however, I at last found a fragment\r\nin which I thought to perceive the works of organised bodies in a\r\nsparry state; I told Mr Clerk so, and our landlord Mr Wright, who had\r\naccompanied us. I have brought home this specimen, which I have now\r\nground and polished; and now it is most evidently full of fragments of\r\nentrochi. Mr Wright then told me he had seen evident impressions of\r\nmarine objects, as I understood from the description, in the slate of\r\nthose mountains; and he was to send me specimens so soon as he could\r\nprocure them.\r\n\r\nHere is one specimen which at once overturns all the speculations formed\r\nupon that negative proposition. The schistus mountains of Cumberland\r\nwere, in this respect, as perfect primitive mountains as any upon the\r\nearth, before this observation; now they have no claim upon that score,\r\nno more than any limestone formed of shells.\r\n\r\nWhen I first announced my belief that such objects in natural history\r\nmight be found, I little thought to have seen it realised, to such a\r\ndegree as has now happened in the little circle of my knowledge. In the\r\nsummer 1791,\r\n\r\nProfessor Playfair was to pass through Cumberland. I begged that he\r\nwould inquire of Mr Wright, at the Low-wood Inn, for those objects which\r\nhe was to endeavour to procure for me, and to examine the limestone\r\nquarry in which I had found the specimen with entrochi. He went through\r\nanother part of those primary mountains, and has found examples of this\r\nkind in the schisti; concerning which he has written me the following\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\"In a visit which I made to the Lakes of Cumberland in September 1791,\r\nin company with the Hon. Francis Charteris, I met with a limestone\r\nfull of marine objects, though from its position it is certainly to be\r\nreckoned among the primary strata. The place where we found this stone\r\nwas in the district of Lancashire, that is west of Windermere Lake, on\r\nthe road from Ambleside to the north end of Coniston Lake, and not far\r\nfrom the point when you come in sight of the latter. Just about this\r\nspot we happened to meet with one of those people who serve as guides\r\nto travelers in those parts, and who told us, among other things, that\r\nstones with shells in them were often found not far from where we were\r\nthen walking. We immediately began to look about for specimens of that\r\nkind, and soon met with several; the most remarkable of which was in a\r\nrock that rose a little above the surface, about 300 or 400 yards to\r\nthe right of the road. It was a part of a limestone stratum, nearly\r\nvertical, and was full of bivalves with the impressions as strong as\r\nin a common secondary limestone. The strata on both sides had the same\r\ninclination, and were decidedly primary, consisting of the ordinary\r\nmicaceous schistus. This however I need not remark to you, who know so\r\nwell from your own observations that the whole of the country I am now\r\nspeaking of has every character of a primary one. I, only mention it,\r\nthat it may not be supposed that the rock in question was some fragment\r\nof a secondary stratum that remained, after the rest was washed away,\r\nsuperincumbent on the primary.\r\n\r\n\"After I had seen this rock, I recollected that you had told me of\r\nsomething of the same kind that you saw in a quarry at Low-wood Inn; and\r\nit may be that both belonged to the same stratum or body of strata; for\r\nthe direction of the strata, as nearly as I could observe, was from S.W.\r\nto N.E.; and this also is nearly the bearing of Low-wood from the place\r\nwhere we now were. I send you a specimen, which you can compare with\r\nthose you brought from the lime quarry at Low-wood.\"\r\n\r\nI have examined this specimen, and find it to be the common schistus\r\nof that country, only containing many bivalve shells and fragments of\r\nentrochi and madrapore bodies, and mixed with pyrites.\r\n\r\nI have already observed that one single example of a shell, or of its\r\nprint, in a schistus, or in a stone stratified among those vertical or\r\nerected masses, suffices to prove the origin of those bodies to have\r\nbeen, what I had maintained them to be, water formed strata erected from\r\nthe bottom of the sea, like every other consolidated stratum of the\r\nearth. But now, I think, I may affirm, that there is not, or rarely, any\r\nconsiderable extent of country of that primary kind, in which some mark\r\nof this origin will not be found, upon careful examination; and now I\r\nwill give my reason for this assertion. I have been examining the south\r\nalpine country of Scotland, occasionally, for more than forty years\r\nback, and I never could find any mark of an organised body in the\r\nschistus of those mountains. It is true that I know of only one place\r\nwhere limestone is found among the strata; this is upon Tweed-side near\r\nthe Crook. This quarry I had carefully examined long ago, but could find\r\nno mark of any organised body in it. I suppose they now are working some\r\nother of the vertical strata near those which I had examined; for, in\r\nthe summer 1792, I received a letter from Sir James Hall, which I shall\r\nnow transcribe. It is dated at Moffat, June 2. 1792.\r\n\r\n\"As I was riding yesterday between Noble-house and Crook, on the road to\r\nthis place, I fell in with a quarry of alpine limestone; it consists of\r\nfour or five strata, about three feet thick, one of them single, and the\r\nrest contiguous; they all stand between the strata of slate and schist\r\nthat are at the place nearly vertical. In the neighbourhood, a slate\r\nquarry is worked of a pure blue slate; several of the strata of slate\r\nnear the limestone are filled with fragments of limestone scattered\r\nabout like the fragments of schist in the sandstone in the neighbourhood\r\nof the junction on our coast.[22]\r\n\r\n[Note 22: This has a reference to very curious observations which we\r\nmade upon the east coast where these mountains terminate, and which I am\r\nto describe in the course of this work.]\r\n\r\n\"Among the masses of limestone lately broken off for use, and having the\r\nfractures fresh, I found the forms of cockles quite distinct; and in\r\ngreat abundance.--I send you three pieces of this kind,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be alleged that those mountains of Cumberland and\r\nTweedale are not the primary mountains, but composed of the secondary\r\nschistus, which is every where known to contain those objects belonging\r\nto a former earth. Naturalists who have not the opportunity of\r\nconvincing themselves by their proper examination, must judge with\r\nregard to that geological fact by the description of others. Now it is\r\nmost fortunate for natural history, that it has been in this range of\r\nmountains that we have discovered those marks of a marine origin; for,\r\nI shall afterwards have occasion to give the clearest light into this\r\nsubject, from observations made in other parts of those same mountains\r\nof schist, by which it will be proved that they are the primary\r\nstrata; and thus no manner of doubt will then remain in the minds\r\nof naturalists, who might otherwise suspect that we were deceiving\r\nourselves, by mistaking the secondary for the primitive schistus.\r\n\r\nI have only farther to observe, that those schisti mountains of Wales,\r\nof Cumberland, and of the south alpine part of Scotland, where these\r\nmarine objects have been found, consist, of that species of stone which\r\nin some places makes the most admirable slate for covering houses; and,\r\nin other parts, it breaks into blocks that so much resemble wood in\r\nappearance, that, without narrow inspection, it might pass for petrified\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore to conclude that the marks of organised bodies in those\r\nprimary mountains are certainly found; at the same time the general\r\nobservation of naturalists has some foundation, so far as the marks of\r\norganised bodies are both rarely to be met with in those masses, and not\r\neasily distinguished as such when they are found.\r\n\r\nBut this scarcity of marine objects is not confined to those primary\r\nmountains, as they are called; for among the most horizontal strata, or\r\nthose of the latest production, there are many in which, it is commonly\r\nthought, no marine calcareous objects are to be found; and this is a\r\nsubject that deserves to be more particularly considered, as the theory\r\nmay thus receive some illustration.\r\n\r\nSandstone, coal, and their accompanying strata, are thought to be\r\ndestitute of calcareous marine productions, although many vestiges of\r\nplants or vegetable productions are there perceived. But this general\r\nopinion is neither accurate nor true; for though it be true that in the\r\ncoal and sandstone strata it is most common to find marks of vegetable\r\nproduction, and rarely those calcareous bodies which are so frequent in\r\nthe limestone, yet it is not unusual for coal to be accompanied\r\nwith limestone formed of shells and corals, and also with ironstone\r\ncontaining many of those marine objects as well as wood. Besides,\r\nsandstone frequently contains objects which have been organised bodies,\r\nbut which do not belong to the vegetable kingdom, at least to no plant\r\nwhich grows upon the land, but would seem to have been some species of\r\nzoophite perhaps unknown.\r\n\r\nI have also frequently seen the vestige of shells in sandstone, although\r\nin these strata the calcareous bodies are in general not perceived.\r\nThe reason of this is evident. When there is a small proportion of the\r\ncalcareous matter in the mass of sand which is pervious to steam and to\r\nthe percolation of water, the calcareous bodies may be easily dissolved,\r\nand either carried away or dispersed in the mass; or even without being\r\nthus dispersed by means of solution, the calcareous matter may be\r\nabsorbed by the siliceous substance of the stratum by means of fusion,\r\nor by heat and cementation. The fact is, that I have seen in sandstone\r\nthe empty mould of marine shells with some siliceous crystallization,\r\nso far as I remember, which corresponded perfectly with that idea. The\r\nplace I saw this was in a fine white sandstone accompanying the coal,\r\nupon the sea side at Brora in Sutherland.\r\n\r\nMineralogy is much indebted to Mr Pallas for the valuable observations\r\nwhich he has given of countries so distant from the habitations of\r\nlearned men. The physiology of the globe has also been enriched with\r\nsome interesting observations from the labours of this learned traveller.\r\nBut besides giving us facts, Mr Pallas has also reasoned upon the\r\nsubject, and thus entered deep into the science of Cosmogeny; here it\r\nis that I am afraid he has introduced some confusion into the natural\r\nhistory of the earth, in not properly distinguishing the mineral\r\noperations of the globe, and those again which belong entirely to the\r\nsurface of the earth; perhaps also in confounding the natural effects of\r\nwater upon the surface of the earth, with those convulsions of the sea\r\nwhich may be properly considered as the accidental operations of the\r\nglobe. This subject being strictly connected with the opinions of that\r\nphilosopher with regard to primitive mountains, I am obliged to examine\r\nin this place matters which otherwise might have come more properly to\r\nbe considered in another.\r\n\r\nM. Pallas in his _Observations sur la formation des montagnes_, (page\r\n48) makes the following observations.\r\n\r\n\"J'ai déjà dit que _la bande de montagnes primitives schisteuses_\r\nhétérogènes, qui, par toute la terre, accompagne les chaînes\r\ngranitiques, et comprend les roches quartzeuses et talceuses mixtes,\r\ntrapézoïdes, serpentines, le schiste corne, les roches spathiques et\r\ncornées, les grais purs, le porphyre et le jaspre, tous rocs fêlés\r\nen couches, ou presque perpendiculaires, ou du moins très-rapidement\r\ninclinées, (les plus favorables à la filtration des eaux), semble\r\naussi-bien que le granit, antérieure à la création organisée. Une raison\r\ntrès-forte pour appuyer cette supposition, c'est que la plupart de ces\r\nroches, quoique lamelleuse en façon d'ardoise, n'a jamais produit\r\naux curieux la moindre trace de pétrifactions ou empreintes de corps\r\norganisés. S'il s'en est trouvé, c'est apparemment dans des fentes de\r\nces roches où ces corps ont été apportés par un deluge, et encastrées\r\napres dans une matière infiltrée, de même qu'on a trouvé des restes\r\nd'Eléphans dans le filon de la mine d'argent du Schlangenberg.[23] Les\r\ncaractères par lesquels plusieurs de ces roches semblent avoir souffert\r\ndes effets d'un feu-très-violent, les puissantes veines et amas des\r\nminéraux les plus riches qui se trouvent principalement dans la bande\r\nqui en est composée, leur position immédiate sur le granit, et même le\r\npassage, par lequel on voit souvent en grand, changer le granit en une\r\ndes autres espèces; tout cela indique une origine bien plus ancienne,\r\net des causes bien différentes de celles qui ont produit les montagnes\r\nsecondaires.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 23: This is a very natural way of reasoning when a philosopher\r\nfinds a fact, related by some naturalists, that does not correspond with\r\nhis theory or systematic view of things. Here our author follows the\r\ngeneral opinion in concluding that no organised body should be found in\r\ntheir primitive strata; when, therefore, such an object is said to have\r\nbeen observed, it is supposed that there may have been some mistake with\r\nregard to the case, and that all the circumstances may not have been\r\nconsidered. This caution with regard to the inaccurate representation of\r\nfacts, in natural history, is certainly extremely necessary; the relicts\r\nof an elephant found in a mineral vein, is certainly a fact of that\r\nkind, which should not be given as an example in geology without the\r\nmost accurate scientifical examination of the subject.]\r\n\r\nHere M. Pallas gives his reason for supposing those mountains primitive\r\nor anterior to the operations of this globe as a living world; _first_,\r\nbecause they have not, in general, marks of animals or plants; and that\r\nit is doubtful if they ever properly contain those marks of organised\r\nbodies; _secondly_, because many of those rocks have the appearance of\r\nhaving suffered the effects of the most violent fire. Now, What are\r\nthose effects? Is it in their having been brought into a fluid state of\r\nfusion. In that case, no doubt, they may have been much changed from the\r\noriginal state of their formation; but this is a very good reason why,\r\nin this changed state, the marks of organised bodies, which may have\r\nbeen in their original constitution, should be now effaced.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ reason for supposing those mountains primitive, is taken\r\nfrom the metallic veins, which are found so plentifully in these masses.\r\nNow, had these masses been the only bodies in this earth in which those\r\nmineral veins were found, there might be some species of reason for\r\ndrawing the conclusion, which is here formed by our philosopher. But\r\nnothing is so common (at least in England) as mineral veins in the\r\nstrata of the latest formation, and in those which are principally\r\nformed of marine productions; consequently so far from serving the\r\npurpose for which this argument was employed, the mineral veins in the\r\nprimitive mountains tend to destroy their originality, by assimilating\r\nthem in some respect with every other mass of strata or mountain upon\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\n_Lastly_, M. Pallas here employs an argument taken from an appearance\r\nfor which we are particularly indebted to him, and by which the\r\narguments which have been already employed in denying the originality\r\nof granite is abundantly confirmed. It has been already alleged, that\r\ngranite, porphyry, and whinstone, or trap, graduate into each other; but\r\nhere M. Pallas informs us that he has found the granite not only changed\r\ninto porphyry, but also into the other alpine compositions. How an\r\nargument for the originality of these mountains can be established upon\r\nthose facts, I am not a little at a loss to conceive.\r\n\r\nThe general mineralogical view of the Russian dominions, which we have,\r\nin this treatise, may now be considered with regard to that distinction\r\nmade by naturalists, of primitive, secondary, and tertiary mountains, in\r\norder to see how far the observations of this well informed naturalist\r\nshall be found to confirm the theory of the earth which has been already\r\ngiven, or not.\r\n\r\nThe Oural mountains form a very long chain, which makes the natural\r\ndivision betwixt Europe and Asia, to the north of the Caspian. If in\r\nthis ridge, as a centre of elevation, and of mineral operations, we\r\nshall find the greatest manifestation of the violent exertion of\r\nsubterraneous fire, or of consolidating and elevating operations; and if\r\nwe shall perceive a regular appearance of diminution in the violence or\r\nmagnitude of those operations, as the places gradually recede from\r\nthis centre of active force; we may find some explanation of those\r\nappearances, without having recourse to conjectures which carry no\r\nscientific meaning, and which are more calculated to confound our\r\nacquired knowledge, than to form any valuable distinction of things. Let\r\nus consult M. Pallas how far this is the case, or not.\r\n\r\nAfter having told us that all those various alpine schisti, jaspers,\r\nporphyries, serpentines, etc. in those mountains, are found mutually\r\nconvertible with granite, or graduating into each other, our author thus\r\ncontinues, (p. 50).\r\n\r\n\"On entrevoit de certaines loix a l'égard de l'arrangement respectif\r\nde cet ordre secondaire d'anciennes roches, par tous les systèmes de\r\nmontagnes qui appartiennent à l'Empire Russe. La chaîne Ouralique, par\r\nexemple, a du côté de l'Orient sur tout sa longueur, une très-grande\r\nabondance de schistes cornés, serpentins et talceux, riches en filons\r\nde cuivre, qui forment le principal accompagnement du granite, et en\r\njaspres de diverses couleurs plus extérieurs et souvent comme entrelacés\r\navec les premiers, mais formant des suites de montagnes entières, et\r\noccupant de très-grands espaces. De ce même côté, il y paraît beaucoup\r\nde quartz en grandes roches toutes pures, tant dans la principale chaîne\r\nque dans le noyau des montagnes de jaspre, et jusques dans la plaine.\r\nLes marbres spateux et veinés, percent en beaucoup d'endroits. La\r\nplupart de ces espèces ne paraissent point du tout à la lisière\r\noccidentale de la chaîne, qui n'est presque que de roche mélangée de\r\nschistes argileux, alumineux, phlogistique, etc. Les filons des mines\r\nd'or mêlées, les riches mines de cuivre en veines et chambrées, les\r\nmines de fer et d'aimant par amas et montagnes entières, sont l'apanage\r\nde la bande schisteuse orientale; tandis que l'occidentale n'a pour elle\r\nque des mines de fer de dépôts, et se montre généralement très-pauvre en\r\nmétaux. Le granit de la chaîne qui borde la Sibérie, est recouvert du\r\ncôté que nous connaissons de roches cornées de la nature des pierres à\r\nfusil, quelquefois tendant à la nature d'un grais fin et de schistes\r\ntrès-métallières de différente composition. Le jaspre n'y est qu'en\r\nfilons, ou plans obliques, ce qui est très-rare pour la chaîne\r\nOuralique, et s'observe dans la plus grande partie de la Sibérie, à\r\nl'exception de cette partie de sa chaîne qui passe près de la mer\r\nd'Okhotsk, ou le jaspre forme derechef des suites de montagnes, ainsi\r\nque nous venons de le dire des monts Ourals; mais comme cette roche\r\ntient ici le côté méridionale de la chaîne Sibérienne, et que nous\r\nne lui connaissons point ce côté sur le reste de sa longueur, il se\r\npourrait que le jaspre y fût aussi abondant. Il faudrait, au reste, bien\r\nplus de fouilles et d observations pour établir quelque chose de certain\r\nsur l'ordre respectif qu'observent ces roches.\"\r\n\r\nI would now ask, if in all this account of the gradation of rock from\r\nthe Oural mountains to the sandy coast of the Baltic, there is to be\r\nobserved any clear and distinctive mark of primitive, secondary, and\r\ntertiary, mountains, farther than as one stratum may be considered as\r\neither prior or posterior to another stratum, according to the order of\r\nsuperposition in which they are found. We have every where evident marks\r\nof the formation of strata by materials deposited originally in water;\r\nfor the most part, there is sufficient proof that this water in which\r\nthose materials had been deposited was the sea; we are likewise assured\r\nthat the operations of this living world producing animals, must\r\nhave, for a course of time, altogether inconceivably been exerted,\r\nin preparing materials for this mass; and, lastly, from the changed\r\nconstitution of those masses, we may infer certain mineral operations\r\nthat melt the substance and alter the position of those horizontal\r\nbodies. Such is the information which we may collect from this mineral\r\ndescription of the Russian Dominions.\r\n\r\nIf we compare some of the Oural mountains with the general strata of\r\nthe Russian plains, then, as to the contained minerals, we may find a\r\ncertain diversity in those two places; at the same time, no greater\r\nperhaps than may be found betwixt two different bodies in those same\r\nplains, for example, chalk and flint. But when we consider those bodies\r\nof the earth, or solid strata of the globe, in relation to their proper\r\nstructure and formation, we surely can find in this description nothing\r\non which may be founded any solid opinion with regard to a different\r\noriginal, however important conclusions may perhaps be formed with\r\nregard to the operations of the globe, from the peculiar appearances\r\nfound in alpine.\r\n\r\nFrom this detail of what is found in the Oural mountains, and in the\r\ngradation of country from those mountains to the plains of Russia, we\r\nhave several facts that are worthy of observation. First extensive\r\nmountains of jasper. I have a specimen of this stone; it is striped red\r\nand green like some of our marly strata. It has evidently been formed of\r\nsuch argillaceous and siliceous materials, not only indurated, so as to\r\nlose its character, as an argillaceous stone, but to have been brought\r\ninto that degree of fusion which produces perfect solidity. Of the same\r\nkind are those hornstein rocks of the nature of flint, sometimes tending\r\nto the nature of a fine sandstone. Here is the same induration of\r\nsandstone by means of fusion, that in the argillaceous strata has\r\nproduced jasper. But oblique veins of jasper are represented as\r\ntraversing these last strata; now this is a fact which is not\r\nconceivable in any other way, than by the injection or transfusion of\r\nthe fluid jasper among those masses of indurated strata.\r\n\r\nAll this belongs to the east side of the mountains. On the west, again,\r\nwe find the same species of strata; only these are not changed to such a\r\ndegree as to lose their original character or construction, and thus to\r\nbe termed differently in mineralogy.\r\n\r\nOur author then proceeds. (p. 53.)\r\n\r\n\"Nous pourrons parler plus décisivement sur les _montagnes secondaires\r\net tertiaires_ de l'Empire, et c'est de celles-là, de la nature, de\r\nl'arrangement et du contenu de leurs couches, des grandes inégalités et\r\nde la forme du continent d'Europe et d'Asie, que l'on peut tirer avec\r\nplus de confiance quelques lumières sur les changemens arrivés aux\r\nterres habitables. Ces deux ordres de montagnes présentent la chronique\r\nde notre globe la plus ancienne, la moins sujette aux falsifications, et\r\nen même-tems plus lisible que le caractère des chaînes primitives;\r\nce font les archives de la nature, antérieures aux lettres et aux\r\ntraditions les plus reculées, qu'il étoit réservé à notre siècle\r\nobservateur de feuiller, de commenter, et de mettre au jour, mais que\r\nplusieurs siècles après le nôtre n'épuiseront pas.\r\n\r\n\"Dans toute l'étendue de vastes dominations Russes, aussi bien que\r\ndans l'Europe entière, les observateurs attentifs ont remarqué\r\nque généralement la band schisteuse des grandes chaînes se trouve\r\nimmédiatement recouverte ou cottée par la _bande calcaire_. Celle-ci\r\nforme deux ordres de montagnes, très-différentes par la hauteur, la\r\nsituation de leurs couches, et la composition de la pierre calcaire qui\r\nles compose; différence qui est très-évidente dans cette bande calcaire\r\nqui forme la lisière occidentale de toute la chaîne Ouralique, et dont\r\nle plan s'étend par tout le plat pays de la Russie. L'on observerait\r\nla même chose à l'orient de la chaîne, et dans toute l'étendue de la\r\nSibérie, si les couches calcaires horizontales n'y étaient recouvertes\r\npar les dépôts postérieures, de façon qu'il ne paraît à la surface que\r\nles parties les plus faillantes de la bande, et si ce pays n'étoit trop\r\nnouvellement cultivé et trop peu exploité par des fouilles et autres\r\nopérations, que des hommes industrieux ont pratiqué dans les pays\r\nanciennement habités. Ce que je vais exposer sur les deux ordres de\r\nmontagnes calcaires, se rapportera donc principalement à celles qui sont\r\nà l'occident de la chaîne Ouralique.\r\n\r\n\"Ce côté de la dite chaîne consiste sur cinquante à cent verstes de\r\nlargeur, de roche calcaire solide, d'un grain uni, qui tantôt ne\r\ncontient aucune trace de productions marines, tantôt n'en conserve\r\nque des empreintes aussi légères qu'éparses. Cette roche s'élève en\r\nmontagnes d'une hauteur très-considérable, irrégulières, rapides, et\r\ncoupées de vallons escarpés. Ses couches, généralement épaisses, ne sont\r\npoint de niveau, mais très-inclinées à l'horizon, paralleles, pour la\r\nplupart, à la direction de la chaîne, qui est aussi ordinairement celle\r\nde la bande schisteuse;--au lieu que du côté de l'orient les couches\r\ncalcaires sont au sens de la chaîne en direction plus ou moins\r\napprochante de l'angle droite. L'on trouve dans ces hautes montagnes\r\ncalcaires de fréquentes grottes et cavernes très-remarquables, tant\r\npar leur grandeur que par les belles congélations et crystallizations\r\nstalactiques dont elles s'ornent. Quelques-unes de ces grottes ne\r\npeuvent être attribuées qu'à quelque bouleversement des couches;\r\nd'autres semblent devoir leur origine à l'écoulement des sources\r\nsouterraines qui ont amolli, rongé et charrié une partie de la roche qui\r\nen étoit susceptible.\r\n\r\n\"En s'éloignant de la chaîne, on voit les couches calcaires s'aplanir\r\nassez rapidement, prendre une position horizontale, et devenir\r\nabondantes en toute forte de coquillages, de madrépores, et d'autres\r\ndépouilles marines. Telles on les voit par-tout dans les vallées les\r\nplus basses qui se trouvent aux pieds des montagnes (comme aux environs\r\nde la rivière d'Oufa); telles aussi, elles occupent tout l'étendue de la\r\ngrande Russie, tant en collines qu'en plat pays; solides tantôt et comme\r\nsemées de productions marines; tantôt toutes composées de coquilles et\r\nmadrépores brisées, et de ce gravier calcaire qui se trouve toujours sur\r\nles parages ou la mer abonde en pareilles productions; tantôt, enfin,\r\ndissoutes en craie et en marines, et souvent entremêlées de couches de\r\ngravier et de cailloux roulés.\"\r\n\r\nHow valuable for science to have naturalists who can distinguish\r\nproperly what they see, and describe intelligibly that which they\r\ndistinguish. In this description of the strata, from the chain of\r\nmountains here considered as primitive, to the plains of Russia, which\r\nare supposed to be of a tertiary formation, our naturalist presents us\r\nwith another species of strata, which he has distinguished, on the one\r\nhand, in relation to the mountains at present in question, and on the\r\nother, with regard to the strata in the plains, concerning which there\r\nis at present no question at all. Now, let us see how these three things\r\nare so connected in their nature, as to form properly the contiguous\r\nlinks of the same chain.\r\n\r\nThe primary and tertiary masses are bodies perfectly disconnected;\r\nand, without a medium by which they might be approached, they would be\r\nconsidered as things differing in all respects, consequently as having\r\ntheir origins of as opposite a nature as are their appearances. But the\r\nnature and formation of those bodies are not left in this obscurity;\r\nfor, the secondary masses, which are interposed, participate so\r\nprecisely of what is truly opposite and characteristic in the primary\r\nand tertiary masses, that it requires nothing more than to see this\r\ndistinction of things in its true light, to be persuaded, that in those\r\nthree different things we may perceive a certain gradation, which\r\nhere takes place among the works of nature, and forms three steps\r\ndistinguishable by a naturalist, although in reality nothing but the\r\nvariable measure of similar operations.\r\n\r\nWe are now to assimilate the primary and tertiary masses, which are so\r\nextremely different, by means of the secondary masses, which is the\r\nmean. The primary and tertiary differ in the following respects: The one\r\nof these contains the relicts of organised bodies which are not observed\r\nin the other. But in the species containing these distinguishable\r\nbodies, the natural structure and position of the mass is little\r\naffected, or not so much as to be called into doubt. This, however, is\r\nnot the case with the other; the species in which organised bodies do\r\nnot appear, is in general so indurated or consolidated in its structure,\r\nand changed in its position, that this common origin of those masses is\r\nby good naturalists, who have also carefully examined them, actually\r\ndenied. Now, the secondary masses may be considered, not only as\r\nintermediate with respect to its actual place, as M. Pallas has\r\nrepresented it, but as uniting together the primary and tertiary, or as\r\nparticipating of the distinguishing characters of the other two. It\r\nis homologated with the primitive mountains, in the solidity of its\r\nsubstance and in the position of its strata; with the tertiary species,\r\nagain, in its containing marks of organised bodies. How far this view\r\nof things is consistent with the theory of the earth now given, is\r\nsubmitted to the consideration of the unprejudiced.\r\n\r\nLet us see what our learned author has said farther on this subject,\r\n(page 65).\r\n\r\n\"Je dois parler d'un ordre de montagnes très-certainement postérieur aux\r\ncouches marines, puisque celles-ci, généralement lui servent de base.\r\nOn n'a point jusqu'ici observé une suite de ces _montagnes tertiaires_,\r\neffet des catastrophes les plus modernes de notre globe, si marquée\r\net si puissante, que celle qui accompagne la chaine Ouralique ou côté\r\noccidentale fur tout la longueur. Cette suite de montagnes, pour la\r\nplupart composées de grais, de marnes rougeâtres, entremêlées de couches\r\ndiversement mixtes, forme une chaîne par-tout séparée par une vallée\r\nplus ou moins large de la bande de roche calcaire, dont nous avons\r\nparlé. Sillonnée et entrecoupée de fréquens vallons, elles s'élève\r\nsouvent à plus de cent toises perpendiculaires, se répand vers les\r\nplaines de la Russie en traînées de collines, qui séparent les rivières,\r\nen accompagnant généralement la rive boréale ou occidentale, et dégénère\r\nenfin en déserts sableux qui occupent de grands espaces, et s'étendent\r\nsurtout par longues bandes parallèles aux principales traces qui suivent\r\nles cours des rivieres. La principale force de ces montagnes tertiaires\r\nest plus près de la chaîne primitive par-tout le gouvernement\r\nd'Orenbourg et la Permie, ou elle consiste principalement en grais, et\r\ncontient un fond inépuisable de mines de cuivre sableuses, argileuses,\r\net autres qui se voient ordinairement dans les couches horizontales.\r\nPlus loin, vers la plaine, sont des suites de collines toutes marneuses,\r\nqui abondent autant en pierres gypseuses, que les autres en minerais\r\ncuivreux. Je n'entre pas dans le détail de celles-ci, qui indiquent\r\nsur-tout les sources salines; mais je dois dire des premières, qui\r\nabondent le plus et dont les plus hautes élévations des plaines, même\r\ncelle de Moscou, sont formées, qu'elles contiennent très-peu de traces\r\nde productions marines, et jamais des amas entiers de ces corps, tels\r\nqu'une mer reposée pendant des siècles de suite a pu les accumuler dans\r\nles bancs calcaires. Rien, au contraire, de plus abondant dans ces\r\nmontagnes de grais stratifié sur l'ancien plan calcaire, que des troncs\r\nd'arbres entières et des fragmens de bois pétrifié, souvent minéralisé\r\npar le cuivre ou le fer; des impressions de troncs de palmires, de\r\ntiges de plantes, de roseau, et de quelques fruits étrangers; enfin des\r\nossemens d'animaux terrestres, si rares dans les couches calcaires. Les\r\nbois pétrifiés se trouvent jusques dans les collines de sable de la\r\nplaine; l'on en tire, entr'autres, des hauteurs sablonneuses aux\r\nenvirons de Sysran sur la Volga, changés en queux très-fin, qui a\r\nconservé jusqu'à la texture organique du bois, et remarquables sur-tout\r\npar les traces très-évidentes de ces vers rongeurs qui attaquent les\r\nvaisseaux, les pilotis et autres bois trempés dans la mer, et qui sont\r\nproprement originaires de la mer des Indes.\"\r\n\r\nThis philosopher has now given us a view of what, according to the\r\npresent fashion of mineral philosophy, he has termed _montagnes\r\nprimitives, secondaires, et tertiaires_. The first consists in masses\r\nand strata, much indurated and consolidated, and greatly displaced in\r\ntheir position; but the character of which is chiefly taken from this,\r\nthat they contain not any visible mark of animal or vegetable bodies.\r\n\r\nThe second are formed in a great measure of marine productions, are\r\noften no less consolidated than those of the first class, and frequently\r\nno less changed in their natural shape and situation.\r\n\r\nThe third again have for character, according to this learned theorist,\r\nthe containing of those organised bodies which are proper to the earth,\r\ninstead of those which in the second class had belonged to the sea;\r\nin other respects, surely there is no essential difference. It is not\r\npretended that these tertiary strata had any other origin, than that of\r\nhaving been deposited in water; it is not so much as suspected, that\r\nthis water had been any other than that of the sea; the few marine\r\nbodies which M. Pallas here acknowledges, goes at least to prove this\r\nfact: and with regard to the mineral operations which had been employed\r\nin consolidating those water formed strata, it is impossible not to be\r\nconvinced that every effect visible in the other two are here also to be\r\nperceived.\r\n\r\nFrom this view of mineral bodies, taken from the extensive observations\r\nof the Russian dominions, and from the suppositions of geologists in\r\nrelation to those appearances, we should be led to conclude that the\r\nglobe of this earth had been originally nothing but an ocean, a world\r\ncontaining neither plant nor animal to live, to grow and propagate its\r\nspecies. In following a system founded on those appearances, we must\r\nnext suppose, that to the sterile unorganised world there had succeeded\r\nan ocean stored with fish of every species. Here it would be proper to\r\ninquire what sustained those aquatic animals; for, in such a system as\r\nthis, there is no provision made for continuing the life even of the\r\nindividuals, far less of feeding the species while, in an almost\r\ninfinite succession of individuals, they should form a continent of land\r\nalmost composed of their _exuviae_.\r\n\r\nIf fish can be fed upon water and stone; if siliceous bodies can, by\r\nthe digesting powers of animals, be converted into argillaceous and\r\ncalcareous earths; and if inflammable matter can be prepared without the\r\nintervention of vegetable bodies, we might erect a system in which this\r\nshould be the natural order of things. But to form a system in direct\r\nopposition to every order of nature that we know, merely because we may\r\nsuppose another order of things different from the laws of nature which\r\nwe observe, would be as inconsistent with the rules of reasoning in\r\nscience, by which the speculations of philosophy are directed, as it\r\nwould be contrary to common sense, by which the affairs of mankind are\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\nStill, however, to pursue our visionary system, after a continent had\r\nbeen formed from the relicts of those animals, living, growing, and\r\npropagating, during an indefinite series of ages, plants at last are\r\nformed; and, what is no less wonderful, those animals which had formed\r\nthe earth then disappear; but, in compensation, we are to suppose, I\r\npresume, that terrestrial animals began. Let us now reason from those\r\nfacts, without either constraining nature, which we know, or forming\r\nvisionary systems, with regard to things which are unknown. It would\r\nappear, that at one period of time, or in one place, the matter of the\r\nglobe may be deposited, in strata, without containing any organised\r\nbodies; at another time, or in another place, much animal matter may be\r\ndeposited in strata, without any vegetable substance there appearing;\r\nbut at another period, or at another time, strata may be formed with\r\nmuch vegetable matter, while there is hardly to be observed any animal\r\nbody. What then are we to conclude upon the whole? That nature, forming\r\nstrata, is subject to vicissitudes; and that it is not always the same\r\nregular operation with respect to the materials, although always forming\r\nstrata upon the same principles. Consequently, upon the same spot in\r\nthe sea, different materials may be accumulated at different periods of\r\ntime, and, conversely, the same or similar materials may be collected in\r\ndifferent places at the same time. Nothing more follows strictly from\r\nthe facts on which we now are reasoning; and this is a conclusion which\r\nwill be verified by every appearance, so far as I know.\r\n\r\nOf this I am certain, that in a very little space of this country, in\r\nmany places, such a course of things is to be perceived. Nothing so\r\ncommon as to find alternated, over and over again, beds of sand-stone\r\nwithout animal bodies, beds of coal and schistus abounding with\r\nvegetable bodies, beds of lime-stone formed of shells and corals, and\r\nbeds or particular strata of iron-stone containing sometimes vegetable\r\nsometimes animal bodies, or both. Here, indeed, the strata are most\r\ncommonly inclined; it is seldom they are horizontal; consequently, as\r\nacross the whole country, all the strata come up to the day, and may be\r\nseen in the beds of our rivers, we have an opportunity of observing that\r\ngreat variety which is in nature, and which we are not able to explain.\r\nThis only is certain, from what we see, that there is nothing formed\r\nin one epoch of nature, but what has been repeated in another, however\r\ndissimilar may be the operations which had intervened between those\r\nseveral epochs.\r\n\r\nIt must not be alleged, that the heights of the Oural mountains, or the\r\nhardness of their rocks, make an essential distinction between them\r\nand the argillaceous or arenaceous strata of the plains; solidity and\r\nhardness, as well as changes in their height and natural position, has\r\nbeen superinduced in operations posterior to the collection of those\r\nmasses,--operations which may be formed in various degrees, even in the\r\ndifferent parts of the same mass. If this is the case, there can be no\r\ndifficulty in conceiving a stratum, which appears to be argillaceous\r\nor marly in the plains, to be found jasper in the Oural mountains. But\r\nthere is nothing in the Oural mountains, that may not be found some\r\nwhere or other in the plains, although the soft and easily decomposing\r\nargillaceous strata be not found upon the Oural mountains, or the Alps,\r\nfor this reason, that had those mountains been formed of such materials,\r\nthere had not been a mountain there at this day.\r\n\r\nBut surely the greatest possible error, with regard to the philosophy of\r\nthis earth, would be to confound the sediment of a river with the strata\r\nof the globe; bodies deposited upon the surface of the earth, with those\r\nsunk at the bottom of the sea; and things which only form the travelled\r\nor transported soil, with those which constitute the substratum or the\r\nsolid earth. How far M. Pallas has committed this oversight, I leave\r\nothers to determine. After mentioning those strata in which wood is\r\nfound petrified, and metallic minerals formed, he thus proceeds, (page\r\n69).\r\n\r\n\"Dans ces mêmes dépôts sableux et souvent limoneux, gisent les restes\r\ndes grands animaux de l'Inde: ces ossemens d'éléphans, de rhinocéros, de\r\nbuffles monstrueux, dont on déterre tous les jours un si grand nombre,\r\net qui font l'admiration des curieux. En Sibérie, où l'on à découvert le\r\nlong de presque toutes les rivières ces restes d'animaux étrangers,\r\net l'ivoire même bien conservé en si grande abondance, qu'il forme un\r\narticle de commerce, en Sibérie, dis je, c'est aussi la couche la plus\r\nmoderne de limon sablonneux qui leur sert de sépulture, et nulle part\r\nces monumens étrangers sont si frequens, qu'aux endroits où la grande\r\nchaine, qui domine surtout la frontière méridionale de la Sibérie, offre\r\nquelque dépression, quelque ouverture considérable.\r\n\r\n\"Ces grands ossemens, tantôt épars tantôt entassés par squelettes,\r\net même par hécatombes, considérée dans leurs sites naturels, m'ont\r\nsur-tout convaincu de la réalité d'un déluge arrivé sur notre terre,\r\nd'une catastrophe, dont j'avoue n'avoir pu concevoir la vraisemblance\r\navant d'avoir parcouru ces places, et vu, par moi-même, tout ce qui peut\r\ny servir de preuve à cet évènement mémorable[24]. Une infinité de ces\r\nossemens couchés dans des lits mêlés de petites tellines calcinées, d'os\r\nde poissons, de glossopètres, de bois chargés d'ocre, etc. prouve déjà\r\nqu'ils ont été transportés par des inondations. Mais la carcasse d'un\r\nrhinocéros, trouvé avec sa peau entière, des restes de tendons, de\r\nligamens, et de cartilages, dans les terres glacées des bords du\r\nViloûi, dont j'ai déposé les parties les mieux conservées au cabinet de\r\nl'Académie, forme encore une preuve convaincante que ce devait être\r\nun mouvement d'inondation des plus violens et des plus rapides, qui\r\nentraîna jadis ces cadavres vers nos climats glacés, avant que la\r\ncorruption eût le tems, d'en détruire les parties molles. Il seroit à\r\nsouhaiter qu'un observateur parvint aux montagnes qui occupent l'espace\r\nentre les fleuves Indighirka et Koylma où selon le rapport des\r\nchasseurs, de semblables carcasses d'éléphans et d'autres animaux\r\ngigantesques encore revêtues de leurs peaux, ont été remarquées à\r\nplusieurs reprises.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 24: Voyez le Mémoire, imprimé dans le XVII. volume des nouveaux\r\nCommentaires de l'Académie Imperiale de Petersbourgh.]\r\n\r\nThe question here turns upon this, Are the sea shells and glossopetrae,\r\nwhich are thus found deposited along with those skeletons, in their\r\nnatural state, or are they petrified and mineralised. If the productions\r\nof the sea shall here be found collected along with bodies belonging to\r\nthe surface of the earth, and which had never been within the limits of\r\nthe sea, this would surely announce to us some strange catastrophe,\r\nof which it would be difficult, perhaps, to form a notion; if, on the\r\ncontrary, those marine productions belong to the solid strata of the\r\nearth, in the resolution or decay of which they had been set at liberty,\r\nand were transported in the floods, our author would have no reason from\r\nthose appearances to conclude, there had existed any other deluge than\r\nthose produced by the waters of the land[25].\r\n\r\n[Note 25: Since writing this, I find my doubts in a great measure\r\nresolved, in reading M. Pallas's Journal, translated from the German by\r\nM. Gauthier de la Peyronie. What I had suspected is, I think, confirmed\r\nin the distinct account which M. Pallas has given of those occasions\r\nin which the bones of land animals and marine objects are found buried\r\ntogether. The marine objects are mineralised; consequently, they have\r\nproceeded from the decomposition of the solid strata; and, having been\r\ntravelled in the running water of the surface of the earth, they must\r\nhave been deposited in those beds of rivers, which now are dry, alongst\r\nwith the bones, or the entire bodies of terrestrial animals, the remains\r\nof which are now found there. This argument, from the state of those\r\nmarine bodies will not be allowed, perhaps by the generality of\r\nmineralists, who attribute to the operations of water every species of\r\npetrifaction or mineralisation; but, until some species of proof be\r\ngiven with regard to the truth of that theory, which vulgar error first\r\nsuggested, I must reason from a theory, in proof of which I have given\r\nclear examples, and, I think, irrefragable arguments, which shall be\r\nmore and more illustrated. Thus may be removed the necessity of a\r\ngeneral deluge, or any great catastrophe, in order to bring together\r\nthings so foreign to each other; but at the same time we would ascertain\r\nthis fact, That formerly the Elephant and Rhinoceros had lived in\r\nSiberia. (See Voyage de Pallas, Tom. II. p. 377 and 403.)]\r\n\r\nHaving thus endeavoured to remove this prevailing prejudice, of there\r\nbeing primitive parts in this earth, parts of which the composition and\r\nconstitution are not to be explained upon the principles of natural\r\nphilosophy, it will be proper to inquire, how far there may be in the\r\ntheory, which has now been given, principles by which may be explained\r\nthose appearances that have led natural philosophers to form\r\nconclusions, of there being in this earth parts whose origin may not be\r\ntraced; and of there being parts whose origin may not be explained upon\r\nthe same principles which apply so well to all the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nConcerning that which may be termed the Primary Part of the Present\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nIn the present theory, it is maintained, that there is no part of the\r\nearth which has not had the same origin, so far as this consists in that\r\nearth being collected at the bottom of the sea, and afterwards produced,\r\nas land, along with masses of melted substances, by the operation of\r\nmineral causes. But, though all those things be similar, or equal, as to\r\nthe manner of their production, they are far from being so with regard\r\nto the periods of their original composition, or to the subsequent\r\noperations which they may have undergone.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain order established for the progress of nature, for the\r\nsuccession of things, and for the circulation of matter upon the surface\r\nof this globe; and, the order of time is associated with this change of\r\nthings. But it is not in equal portions that time is thus combined with\r\ndissimilar things, nor always found, in our estimation, as equally\r\naccompanying those which we reckon similar. The succession of light and\r\ndarkness is that which, in those operations, appears to us most steady;\r\nthe alternation of heat and cold comes next, but not with equal\r\nregularity in its periods. The succession of wet and dry upon the\r\nsurface of the earth, though equally the work of nature and the effect\r\nof regular causes, is often to us irregular, when we look for equal\r\nperiods in the course of things which are unequal. It is by equalities\r\nthat we find order in things, and we wish to find order every where.\r\n\r\nThe present object of our contemplation is the alternation of land\r\nand water upon the surface of this globe. It is only in knowing this\r\nsuccession of things, that natural appearances can be explained; and\r\nit is only from the examination of those appearances, that any certain\r\nknowledge of this operation is to be obtained. But how shall we acquire\r\nthe knowledge of a system calculated for millions, not of years only,\r\nnor of the ages of man, but of the races of men, and the successions of\r\nempires? There is no question here with regard to the memory of man, of\r\nany human record, which continues the memory of man from age to age; we\r\nmust read the transactions of time past, in the present state of natural\r\nbodies; and, for the reading of this character, we have nothing but\r\nthe laws of nature, established in the science of man by his inductive\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\nIt has been in reasoning after this manner, that I have endeavoured to\r\nprove, that every thing which we now behold, of the solid parts of this\r\nearth, had been formerly at the bottom of the sea; and that there is, in\r\nthe constitution of this globe, a power for interchanging sea and land.\r\nIf this shall be admitted as a just view of the system of this globe,\r\nwe may next examine, how far there are to be found any marks of certain\r\nparts of our earth having more than once undergone that change of\r\nposture, or vicissitude of things, and of having had reiterated\r\noperations of the mineral kingdom changing their substance, as well as\r\naltering their positions in relation to the atmosphere and sea.\r\n\r\nBesides the gradual decay of solid land, exposed to the silent\r\ninfluences of the atmosphere, and to the violent operations of the\r\nwaters moving upon the surface of the earth, there is a more sudden\r\ndestruction that may be supposed to happen sometimes to our continents\r\nof land. In order to see this, it must be considered, that the\r\ncontinents of our earth are only raised above the level of the sea by\r\nthe expansion of matter, placed below that land, and rarified in that\r\nplace: We may thus consider our land as placed upon pillars, which may\r\nbreak, and thus restore the ancient situation of things when this land\r\nhad been originally collected at the bottom of the ocean. It is not here\r\ninquired by what mechanism this operation is to be performed; it is\r\ncertainly by the exertion of a subterranean power that the land is\r\nelevated from the place in which it had been formed; and nothing is more\r\nnatural than to suppose the supports of the land in time to fail, or be\r\ndestroyed in the course of mineral operations which are to us unknown.\r\nIn that case, whatever were remaining of that land, which had for\r\nmillions of ages past sustained plants and animals, would again be\r\nplaced at the bottom of the sea; and strata of every different species\r\nmight be deposited again upon that mass, which, from an atmospheric\r\nsituation, is now supposed to be lower than the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nSuch a compound mass might be again resuscitated, or restored with the\r\nnew superincumbent strata, consolidated in their texture and inclined in\r\ntheir position. In that case, the inferior mass must have undergone a\r\ndouble course of mineral changes and displacement; consequently, the\r\neffect of subterranean heat or fusion must be more apparent in this\r\nmass, and the marks of its original formation more and more obliterated.\r\n\r\nIf, in examining our land, we shall find a mass of matter which had been\r\nevidently formed originally in the ordinary manner of stratification,\r\nbut which is now extremely distorted in its structure, and displaced in\r\nits position,--which is also extremely consolidated in its mass, and\r\nvariously changed in its composition,--which therefore has the marks\r\nof its original or marine composition extremely obliterated, and many\r\nsubsequent veins of melted mineral matter interjected; we should then\r\nreason to suppose that here were masses of matter which, though not\r\ndifferent in their origin from those that are gradually deposited at the\r\nbottom of the ocean, have been more acted upon by subterranean heat and\r\nthe expanding power, that is to say, have been changed in a greater\r\ndegree by the operations of the mineral region. If this conclusion shall\r\nbe thought reasonable, then here is an explanation of all the peculiar\r\nappearances of the alpine schistus masses of our land, those parts which\r\nhave been erroneously considered as primitive in the constitution of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nWe are thus led to suppose, that some parts of our earth may have\r\nundergone the vicissitudes of sea and land more than once, having been\r\nchanged from the summit of a continent to the bottom of the sea, and\r\nagain erected, with the rest of that bottom, into the place of land. In\r\nthat case, appearances might be found to induce natural philosophers to\r\nconclude that there were in our land primary parts, which had not the\r\nmarine origin which is generally to be acknowledged in the structure\r\nof this earth; and, by finding other masses, of marine origin,\r\nsuperincumbent upon those primary mountains, they might make strange\r\nsuppositions in order to explain those natural appearances.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what has been advanced by those philosophers who, though\r\nthey term these parts of the earth _primordial_, and not _primitive_, at\r\nthe same time appear to deny to those parts an origin analogous to that\r\nof their secondary mountains, or strata that are aquiform in their\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nM. de Luc, after having long believed that the strata of the Alps had\r\nbeen formed like those of the low countries, at the bottom of the sea,\r\ngives an account of the occasion by which he was first confirmed in the\r\nopposite opinion.[26] Like a true philosopher, he gives us the reason of\r\nthis change.\r\n\r\n[Note 26: Lettres Physique et Morales sur l'Histoire de la Terre, tom.\r\n2. pag. 206.]\r\n\r\n\"Ce fut une espèce de _montagne_ très commune, et que j'avois souvent\r\nexaminée qui dessilla mes yeux. La pierre qui la compose est de\r\nla classe appellée _schiste_; son caractère générique est d'être\r\n_feuilletée_; elle renferme _l'ardoise_ dont on couvre les toits. Ces\r\n_feuillets_ minces, qu'on peut prendre pour des _couches_, et qui le\r\nfont en effet dans quelques pierres de ce genre, rappelloient toujours\r\nl'idée vague de dépôts des eaux. Mais il y a des masses dont la\r\ncomposition est plutôt par fibres que par feuillets, et dont le moëllon\r\nressemble aux copeaux de bois d'un chantier. Le plus souvent aussi les\r\nfeuillets sont situés en toute suite de sens dans une même _montagne_,\r\net quelquefois même verticalement, Enfin il s'en trouve de si tortillés,\r\nqu'il est impossible de les regarder comme des dépôts de l'eau.\r\n\r\n\"Ce fut donc cette espèce de montagne qui me persuada la première\r\nque toutes les montagnes n'avoient pas une même origine. Le lieu où\r\nj'abjurai mon erreur, étoit un de ces grands _chantiers_ pétrifiés, qui,\r\npar la variété du tortillement, et des zig-zags des fibres du moëllon\r\nqui le composoit, attira singulièrement mon attention. C'étoit un sort\r\ngrand talus qui venoit d'une face escarpée; j'y montai pour m'approcher\r\ndu rocher, et je remarquai, avec étonnement, des multitudes de paquets\r\nenchevêtrés les uns dans les autres, sans ordre ni direction fixe; les\r\nuns presqu'en rouleaux; les autres en zig-zag; et même ce qui, séparé de\r\nla montagne, eût peu être pris pour des _couches_, le trouvoit incliné\r\nde toute manière dans cette même face de rocher. _Non_, me dis-je alors\r\nà moi-même; _non, l'eau n'a pu faire cette montagne.... Ni celle-là\r\ndonc_, ajoutai-je en regardant ailleurs.... _Et pourquoi mieux celle-là?\r\nPourquoi toutes les montagnes devroient-elles être le produit des eaux,\r\nseulement parce qu'il y en a quelques-unes qui annoncent cette origine_?\r\nEn effet, puis qu'on n'a songé aux eaux, comme cause des montagnes,\r\nque par les preuves évidentes que quelques-unes offroient de cette\r\nformation; pourquoi étendre cette conséquence à toutes, s'il y en\r\na beaucoup qui manquent de ces caractères? C'est comme le dit Mr.\r\nd'Alembert, qu'on généralise ses premières remarques l'instant d'apres\r\nqu'on ne remarquoit rien.\"\r\n\r\nScience is indebted to this author for giving us so clear a picture\r\nof natural appearances, and of his own reasoning upon those facts, in\r\nforming his opinion; he thus leads astray no person of sound judgment,\r\nalthough he may be in error. The disposition of things in the present\r\ncase are such, that, reasoning from his principles, this author could\r\nnot see the truth; because he had not been persuaded, that aquiform\r\nstrata could have been so changed by the chemical power of fusion, and\r\nthe mechanical force of bending while in a certain state of softness.\r\n\r\nBut though, in this case, the reasoning of this philosopher is to be\r\njustified, so far as he proceeded upon principles which could not lead\r\nhim to the truth, his conduct is not so irreproachable in applying them\r\nto cases by which their fallacy might have been detected. This author\r\nacknowledges calcareous strata to be aquiform in their original; but,\r\nin those mountains which he has so much examined, he will find those\r\naquiform bodies have undergone the same species of changes, which made\r\nhim conclude that those schistus mountains had not been truly aquiform,\r\nas he at first had thought them. This would have led him to reason back\r\nupon his principles, and to say, _If one species of strata may be thus\r\nchanged in its texture, and its shape, may not another be equally so?\r\nTherefore, may not the origin of both be similar_?\r\n\r\nBut least I should do injustice to this author, to whom we are indebted\r\nfor many valuable observations in natural history, I shall transcribe\r\nwhat he has said upon the subject, being persuaded that my readers will\r\nnot think this improper in me, or impertinent to the argument.\r\n\r\n\"Quand nous fumes une fois persuadés que la mer n'avoit pas fait\r\ntoutes les _montagnes_, nous entreprîmes de découvrir les caractères\r\ndistinctifs de celles qui lui devoient leur origine; et s'il étoit, par\r\nexemple, des matières qui leur fussent propres. Mais nous y trouvâmes\r\nles mêmes difficultés qu'on rencontre dans tout ce qu'on veut classer\r\ndans la nature. On peut bien distinguer entr'elles les choses qui\r\nont fortement l'empreinte de leur classe; mais les confins échappent\r\ntoujours.\r\n\r\n\"C'est là, pour le dire en passant, ce qui a pu conduire quelques\r\nphilosophes à imaginer cette _chaîne des êtres_ où ils supposent,\r\nque, de la pierre à l'homme et plus haut, les nuances sont réellement\r\nimperceptibles. Comme si, quoique les limites soyent cachées à nos sens,\r\nnotre intelligence ne nous disoit pas, qu'il y a un _saut_, une distance\r\nmême infinie, entre le plus petit degré d'organization _propageante_,\r\net la matière unie par la simple cohésion: entre le plus petit degré de\r\n_sensibilité_, et la matière insensible: entre la plus petite capacité\r\nd'observer et de transmettre ses observations, et l'instinct constamment\r\nle même dans l'espèce. Toutes ces différences tranchées existent dans la\r\nnature; mais notre incapacité de rien connoître à fond, et la necessité\r\noù nous sommes de juger de tout sur des apparences, nous fait perdre\r\npresque toutes les limites, parce que sur ces bords, la plupart des\r\nphénomènes sont équivoques. Ainsi la plante nous paroît se rapprocher de\r\nla pierre, mais n'en approche jamais réellement.\r\n\r\n\"On éprouve la même difficulté à classer les montagnes; et quoique\r\ndepuis quelque tems plusieurs naturalistes ayent aussi observé qu'elles\r\nn'ont pas toutes la même origine, je ne vois pas qu'on soit parvenu à\r\nfixer des caractères infaillibles, pour les placer sûrement toutes dans\r\nleurs classes particulières.\r\n\r\n\"Après avoir examiné attentivement cet objet, d'après les phénomènes que\r\nj'ai moi-même observés, et ce que j'ai appris par les observations des\r\nautres; j'ai vu que c'étoit là un champ très vaste, quand on vouloit\r\nl'embrasser en entier, et trop vaste pour moi, qui n'étoit pas libre d'y\r\nconsacrer tout le tems qu'il exige. Je me suis donc replié sur mon objet\r\nprincipal, savoir _la cause qui a laissé des dépouilles marines dans nos\r\ncontinens_, et l'examen des hypothèses sur cette matière.\r\n\r\n\"Les phénomènes ainsi limités, se réduisent à ceci: qu'il y a dans nos\r\ncontinens des montagnes visiblement formées par des _dépôts successifs\r\nde la mer_ et a l'égard des quelles il n'y a besoin de rien imaginer, si\r\nce n'est la manière dont elles en sont sorties: qu'il y en a d'autres au\r\ncontraire, qui ne portent aucun des caractères de cette cause, et qui,\r\nsi elles ont été produites dans la _mer_, doivent être l'effet de toute\r\nautre cause que de simples dépôts successifs, et avoir même précédé\r\nl'existence des animaux marins. J'abandonne donc les classes confuses\r\noù ces caractères sont équivoques, jusqu'à ce qu'elles servent à fonder\r\nquelque hypothèse; ayant assez de ces deux classes très distinctes pour\r\nexaminer d'apres elles tous les systèmes qui me sont connus.\r\n\r\n\"Là où ces deux classes de montagnes sont mêlées, on remarque que celles\r\nqui sont formées par _couches_, et qui renferment des _corps marins_,\r\nrecouvrent souvent celles de l'autre classe, mais n'en sont jamais\r\nrecouvertes. On a donc naturellement conclu, que lors même que la _mer_\r\nauroit en quelque part à la formation des montagnes où l'on ne reconnoît\r\npas son caractère, celles auxquelles elle a travaillé seule, en enlevant\r\ndes matières dans certaines parties de son fond et les déposant dans\r\nd'autres, font au moins les dernières formées. On les a donc nommées\r\n_secondaires_, et les autres _primitives_.\r\n\r\n\"J'adopterai la première de ces expressions; car c'est la même qui nous\r\nétoit venu à l'esprit à mon frère, et à moi longtemps avant que nous\r\nl'eussions vue employer; mais je substituerai celle de _primordiales à_\r\n_primitives_ pour l'autre classe de _montagnes_, afin de ne rien décider\r\nsur leur origine. Il est des _montagnes_, dont jusqu'à present on n'a pu\r\ndémêler la cause: voila le fait. Je ne dirai donc pas qu'elles ont\r\nété créées ainsi, parce qu'en physique je ne dois pas employer des\r\nexpressions sur lesquelles on ne s'entend pas. Sans doute cependant,\r\nque l'histoire naturelle ni la physique ne nous conduisent nullement à\r\ncroire que notre globe ait existé de toute éternité; et lorsqu'il prit\r\nnaissance, il fallut bien que la matière qui le composa fut de quelque\r\nnature, ou sous quelque première forme intégrante. Rien donc jusqu'ici\r\nn'empêche d'admettre que ces _montagnes_ que je nommerai _primordiales_,\r\nne soient réellement _primitives_; je penche même pour cette opinion\r\nà l'égard de quelques unes. Mais il y a une très grande variété\r\nentr'elles; et quoiqu'elles soyent toutes également exclues de la classe\r\n_secondaire_, elles ne sont pas toutes semblables: il y en a même un\r\ngrand nombre dont les matières ont une certaine configuration qui semble\r\nannoncer qu'elles ayent été molles et durcies ensuite, quoique par\r\nune toute autre cause que celle qui a agi pour former les montagnes\r\nsecondaires.\"\r\n\r\nHere I would beg leave to call the attention of philosophers to this\r\nobservation of a naturalist who explains all petrification, and the\r\nconsolidation of strata by aqueous infiltration. If he has here found\r\nreason to conclude that, in those primordial parts of the earth, there\r\nare a great number which, from their present configuration, must have\r\nbeen in a soft state and then hardened, and this by a quite different\r\ncause from that which he supposes had produced the consolidation and\r\nhardness of the secondary parts; this is entering precisely into my\r\nviews of the subject, in ascribing all the consolidation of the earth,\r\nwhether primary or secondary, to one general cause, and in tracing this\r\ncause, from its effects, to be no other than the fusion of those bodies.\r\nIt must be evident, that if this philosopher has seen good reason for\r\nconcluding such a softening cause, which had operated upon the primary\r\nparts, to be quite different from that which he ascribes to the\r\nconsolidation of the secondary, which is the effect of water, it must\r\nthen, I say, be evident that the softening cause of the primary parts,\r\nif not heat, by which every degree of fusion may be produced, must be an\r\noccult cause, one which cannot be admitted into natural philosophy.\r\n\r\nBy thus choosing to consider mountains as of two distinct kinds, one\r\naquiform which is understood, and the other primordial which is not to\r\nbe known, we supersede the necessity of reconciling a theory with many\r\nappearances in nature which otherwise might be extremely inconvenient\r\nto our explanation, if not inconsistent with our system. Our author no\r\ndoubt has thus relieved himself from a considerable difficulty in the\r\nphilosophy of this earth, by saying here is a great part which is not\r\nto be explained. But I would beg leave to observe, that this form of\r\ndiscussion, with regard to a physical subject, is but a mere confession\r\nof our ignorance, and has no tendency to clear up another part of the\r\nsubject of which one treats, however it may impress us with a favourable\r\nopinion of the theorist, in allowing him all the candour of the\r\nacknowledgement.\r\n\r\nThe general result of the reasoning which we now have quoted, and what\r\nfollows in his examination, seems to terminate in this; that there are\r\nvarious different compositions of mountains which this author cannot\r\nallow to be the production of the sea; but it is not upon account of\r\nthe matter of which they are formed, or of the particular mixture and\r\ncomposition of those species of matter, of which the variety is almost\r\nindefinite. According to this philosopher, the distinction that we are\r\nto make of those primordial and secondary competitions, consists in\r\nthis, that the first are in such a shape and structure as cannot be\r\nconceived to be formed by subsidence in water.\r\n\r\nM. de Saussure has carefully examined those same objects; and he seems\r\ninclined to think that they must have been the operation of the ocean;\r\nnot in the common manner of depositing strata, but in some other way by\r\ncrystallization. The present theory supposes all those masses formed\r\noriginally in the ordinary manner, by the deposits or subsidence\r\nof materials transported in the waters, and that those strata were\r\nafterwards changed by operations proper to the mineral regions.\r\n\r\nBut the subject of the present investigation goes farther, by inquiring\r\nif, in the operations of the globe, a primary and secondary class of\r\nbodies may be distinguished, so far as the one may have undergone the\r\noperations of the globe, or the vicissitudes of sea and land, oftener\r\nthan the other, consequently must be anterior to the later productions\r\nboth in time and operation, although the original of all those bodies\r\nbe the same, and the operations of the earth, so far as we see in the\r\neffects, always proceed upon the same principles. This is an extensive\r\nview of nature to which few have turned their thoughts. But this is\r\na subject to which the observations described by this author have\r\nevidently a reference.\r\n\r\nIn his 113th letter, he has given us a view of one of those parts of the\r\nearth that are proper to be examined in determining this question so\r\nimportant in the genealogy of land, although no ways concerned in\r\naltering the principles upon which nature in forming continents must\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nIt is in describing the nature of the mountains about _Elbingerode_; and\r\nhe begins in ascending from Hefeld.\r\n\r\n\"Cette partie extérieure de la chaîne est _primordiale_: c'est du\r\n_granit_ à _Hereld_ et au commencement de la route; puis quand on passe\r\ndans d'autres vallées, on trouve les _schistes_ et la _roche grise_ dans\r\ntout le pied des montagnes: mais des qu'on est arrivé à une certain\r\nhauteur, on voit de la _pierre à chaux_ par couches étendue sur ces\r\nmatières; et c'est elle qui forme le sommet de ces mêmes montagnes;\r\ntellement que la plaine élevée, qui conduit à _Elbingerode_, est\r\nentièrement de _pierre à chaux_, excepté dans sa partie la plus haute ou\r\ncette pierre est recouverte des mêmes _grès_ et sables _vitrescibles_\r\nqui sont sur le schiste du Bruchberg et sur la _pierre à chaux_ dans la\r\n_Hesse_ et le pays de Gottingue.\r\n\r\n\"Les environs d'Elbingerode étant plus bas que ces parties recouvertes\r\nde matières vitrescibles, montrent la _pierre à chaux_ à nud; et l'on y\r\ntrouve de très beaux marbres, dont les nuances jaunes, rouges et vertes\r\nsont souvent très vives, et embellies par les coupes des _corps marins_.\r\n\r\n\"Cependant le schiste n'est pas enseveli partout sous ces dépôts de la\r\nmer; on le retrouve en quelques endroits, et même avec de _filons_.\r\n\r\n\"Ainsi au milieu de ces matières _calcaires_ qui forment le sol montueux\r\ndes environs _d'Elbingerode_, paroît encore le _schiste_ sur lequel\r\nelles ont été déposées: Et en montant à la partie la plus élevée de\r\nces mêmes environs, on trouve que la _pierre à chaux_ est recouverte\r\nelle-même d'une _pierre sableuse_ grise par couches, dans laquelle on\r\nvoit quantité de petits fragmens de _schiste_ posés de plat. C'est la\r\nque se trouve une des mines de _fer_ dont le minerai va en partie à la\r\n_Koningshutte_, mais en plus grande partie à la _Rothechutte_, qui n'est\r\nqu'à une lieue de distance. On perce d'abord la couche sableuse; sous\r\nelle se trouve de la _pierre à chaux_ grise; puis une couche de\r\n_pierre à chaux ferrugineuse_, remplie de _corps marins_, et surtout\r\n_d'entroques_: C'est cette _couche_ qui est ici le _minerai_; et elle\r\nappartient à la formation de cette éminence comme toutes les autres\r\n_couches_. Cette mine se nomme _bomshey_: elle n'est pas riche; mais\r\nelle sert de _fondant_ aux matières ferrugineuses tirées des filons des\r\nmontagnes primordiales en même tems qu'elle leur ajoute son _fer_ dans\r\nla fonte. A quelque distance de là on a percé un autre puits; qui a\r\ntransversé d'abord une sorte de pierre, que je ne saurois nommer, mais\r\nqui ressemble fort à une _lave_ poreuse. Au dessous de cette couche on a\r\nretrouvé la _pierre à chaux_ ordinaire; puis la _couche ferrugineuse_ y\r\ncontinue; mais elle diffère un peu de ce qu'elle est dans l'autre mine,\r\nune partie de sa substance étant convertie en _jaspe_.\r\n\r\n\"Mais ce qui est digne de la plus grande attention dans cette contrée,\r\nest un filon peu distant nomme _Buchenberg_, qui appartient en partie au\r\nRoi, et en partie à Mr. le Comte de _Wernigerode_. La montagne en cette\r\nendroit montre une vallée artificielle de 70 à 80 pieds de profondeur,\r\nde 20 à 30 de largeur dans le haut, et de 400 toises en étendue. C'est\r\nle creusement qu'on a déjà fait en suivant ce _filon_ de _fer_, que l'on\r\ncontinue à exploiter de la même manière sur les terres de Mr. le Comte\r\nde _Wernigerode_. La matière propre de la montagne _est_ de _schiste_;\r\net la vallée qui se forme de nouveau à mesure qu'on enlève la _gangue_\r\ndu _filon_, a sûrement déjà existé dans la mer sous la forme d'une\r\n_fente_, qui a été remplie, et en particulier des ingrédiens dont on\r\nfait aujourd'hui le _fer_.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a supposition of our author that corresponds to nothing which\r\nhas yet been observed any where else, so far as I know. It is concerning\r\na mineral vein, one which does not appear to differ in any respect from\r\nother mineral veins, except in being worked in that open manner which\r\nhas given our author an idea of its being a valley. He then supposes\r\nthat valley (or rather empty vein) to have been in this mountain when at\r\nthe bottom of the sea, and that this mineral vein had then been filled\r\nwith those materials which now are found in that space between the two\r\nsides of the separated rock. This is a very different operation from\r\nthat of infiltration, which is commonly supposed to be the method of\r\nfilling mineral veins; but, we shall soon see the reason why our author\r\nhas here deserted the common hypothesis, and has adopted another to\r\nserve the occasion, without appearing to have considered how perfectly\r\ninconsistent those two suppositions are to each other. That mineral\r\nveins have been filled with matter in a fluid state, is acknowledged by\r\nevery body who has either looked at a mineral vein in the earth, or in a\r\ncabinet specimen; mineralists and geologists, in general, suppose this\r\nto have been done by means of solutions and concretions, a supposition\r\nby no means warranted by appearances, which, on the contrary, in general\r\ndemonstrate that the materials of those veins had been introduced in the\r\nfluid state of fusion. But here is a new idea with regard to the filling\r\nof those veins; and, I would now beg the reader's attention to the facts\r\nwhich follow in this interesting description, and which have suggested\r\nthat idea to our author.\r\n\r\n\"Quand cette matière accidentelle est enlevée, on voit la coupe du\r\n_schiste_ des deux côtes de la _fente_, faisant un _toit_ et un _mur_,\r\nparce que la _fente_ n'est pas absolument verticale: des qu'il y a\r\nun peu d'inclinaison, on distingue un _toit_ et un mur, comme j'ai\r\nl'honneur de l'expliquer à V.M. On ne connoît point encore l'étendue de\r\nce filon, ni dans sa profondeur, où l'on ne peut pas s'enfoncer beaucoup\r\nde cette manière, ni dans la longueur, selon laquelle on continue à\r\nl'exploiter.\r\n\r\n\"Voilà donc un _filon_, à la rigueur de la définition que j'en ai donné\r\nà V.M. c'est à dire, une _fente_ dans la montagne naturelle, _comblée_\r\nde _matière_ étrangère. Mais ce qu'il y a d'extraordinaire ici, c'est\r\nque cette _matière_ vient de la _mer_: ce sont différentes _couches\r\naquiformes_, dont quelques unes sont remplies de _corps marins_. Il y\r\na des _couches_ d'une _terre martiale_ fort brune et sans liaison:\r\nd'autres, au contraire toujours _martiales_, sont très dures et\r\nrenferment de très beau jaspe sanguin: d'autres enfin sont de vrai\r\n_marbre_ gris veinées de rouge. C'est dans ce marbre que font les _corps\r\nmarins_, savoir des coquillages et des spongites; et il est lui-même\r\nmartial comme tout le reste: les mineurs le nomment _Kubrimen_, et ne\r\nl'employent que comme un _fondant_ pour d'autres _minéraux de fer_.\r\n\r\n\"A ce _filon_, s'en joignent d'autres plus embarrassans. Ils viennent du\r\n_toit_, qu'ils divisent par de larges _fentes_ comblées, aboutissantes\r\nau _filon_ principale. Ils font de même _calcaires_ et marins faits par\r\n_couches_; mais ces _couches_ ont une si grande inclinaison, que je ne\r\npuis les comprendre: il faut qu'il y ait eu d'étranges bouleversemens\r\ndans ces endroits-là[27].\r\n\r\n[Note 27: Here, no doubt, are appearances which it is impossible to\r\nexplain by the theory of infiltration; it is the filling of mineral\r\nveins, and their branches or ramifications, with marble containing marks\r\nof marine objects. But, if we shall suppose this marble to have been in\r\nthe fluid state of fusion, as well as the iron-ore and jasper, we may\r\neasily conceive it introduced into the principal vein and its branches.\r\nThe description here given of those appearances is by no means such as\r\nto enable us to judge particularly of this case, which surely merits the\r\nmost accurate investigation, and which, I doubt not, will give physical\r\ndemonstration of the fusion of those mineral substances. I know that\r\nshells have been found within the body of veins in Germany; but, a\r\nstratification of those materials in a vein was never heard of before,\r\nso far as I know.]\r\n\r\n\"Ces _fentes_ se sont faites, et ont été remplies, dans la _mer_;\r\npuisque les matières qui les remplissent sont de la classe de ses dépôts\r\ntrès connoissables, et qu'il contiennent des _dépouilles marines_. Mais\r\nce qui embarrasse alors c'est que les autres _filons_ ne soyent pas dans\r\nle même cas. N'est ce point là encore un indice, que ces _fentes_ out\r\nété d'abord et principalement remplies de matières, poussées du fond par\r\nla même force qui secouoit les montagnes[28].\r\n\r\n[Note 28: But what is this power by which matter is to be forced from\r\nthe bottom of the sea to the top of the mountains? For, unless we can\r\nform some idea of that power which, as a cause, we ascribe to the\r\nperceived effect, we either say nothing to the purpose, or we employ a\r\npreternatural cause. It is not sufficient to imagine a power capable of\r\nraising from the bottom of the sea the materials deposited in the abyss;\r\nit is also necessary to find a power capable of softening bodies which\r\nare hard, and of thus consolidating those masses which are formed of\r\nloose or unconnected materials. Such a power, indeed, the present theory\r\nassumes; and, so far as this shall be implied in the supposition of our\r\nauthor, it will thus have received a certain conformation.]\r\n\r\n\"Ce _filon_ n'est pas le seul dans le _Hartz_ qui donne des signes\r\n_marins_. Il y en a un autre, qui même se rapproche davantage de\r\nla nature du commun des _filons_, et où l'on trouve aussi des\r\n_coquillages_. C'est celui de _Haus-Hartzbergerzug_, pres de\r\n_Clausthal_, où, dans les _Halles_ de quelques mines de plomb\r\nabandonnées, et dans une forte _d'ardoise_, on trouve de petites\r\n_moules_ ou _tellines_ striées, d'une espèce particulière que j'ai vue\r\ndans des _ardoises secondaires d'Arotzen_ en _Waldek_ et de _Sombernon_\r\nen _Bourgogne_. Il y a donc certainement quelques _filons_ faits par les\r\ndépôts de la _mer_ dans les _fentes_ de montagnes _primordiales_; comme\r\nau contraire il y a des _filons_ métalliques sans indices _marins_,\r\ndans des montagnes évidemment _secondaires_, telles que celles de\r\n_Derbyshire_, ou les _filons_ de _plomb_ traversent des couches de\r\n_pierre à chaux_.\"\r\n\r\nHere again our author seems to me to refute his own supposition, That a\r\nchasm in the schistus rock may have existed at the bottom of the sea,\r\nand been then filled from above with such materials as were transported\r\nby the moving water to that place, is not impossible; but nobody, who\r\nknows the nature of a common metallic vein, can ever suppose it to have\r\nbeen filled in that manner. Our author then adds, \"On ne fait réellement\r\nque commencer dans ce genre d'observations, considérées quant à la\r\nCosmologie; ainsi il ne faut point désespérer que tout cela ne se\r\ndévoile un jour, et que nous n'acquerrions ainsi un peu plus de\r\nconnoissance sur ce qui se passoit dans la _mer ancienne_.\r\n\r\n\"En revenant vers _Elbingerode_, nous retrouvâmes ces _schistes_, qui\r\nparoissent au travers des _marbres:_ ils sont donc la continuation de la\r\nmasse _schisteuse_ à laquelle appartient le _filon_, dont je viens de\r\nparler. Ce _filon_ à été formé dans une _fente_, restée ouverte et vide:\r\nles dépôts de la _mer_ l'ont comblée, en même tems qu'ils formoient\r\nles couches de _marbre_, qui sont à l'extérieur. En effet, ce _filon_\r\ncontient des _couches marines ferrugineuses_, de la même nature que\r\ncelles des collines calcaires voisines formées sur le schiste.\r\n\r\n\"Nous partîmes _d'Elbingerode_ dans l'après midi pour nous rapprocher\r\nde Clausthal. Notre chemin fut encore quelque tems sur des sommités\r\n_calcaires_; et avant que d'en sortir, nous trouvâmes une autre mine\r\nsingulière à _Arenfeld_. C'est encore un vrai _filon_; mais dans une\r\nmontagne de _pierre à chaux:_ C'est à-dire, que cette montagne a aussi\r\nété _fendue_, et que la _fente_ a été remplie d'une _gangue_. La matière\r\nde ce _filon_ est encore _calcaire_ en plus grande partie; mais\r\ncette _pierre à chaux_ distincte est _ferrugineuse_, et parsemée de\r\nconcrétions de _jaspe_ comme celles _d'Elbingerode:_ on y trouve aussi\r\nune matière verdâtre, qui, comme le _jaspe_, ne fait pas effervescence\r\navec l'eau forte.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a phenomenon which is altogether incompatible with the theory\r\nthat this author has given us for the explanation of those appearances.\r\nHe supposes empty crevices in the schistus mountains at the bottom of\r\nthe sea; these crevices he supposes filled by the deposits of the sea,\r\nat the same time, and with the same materials with which the lime-stone\r\nstrata were formed above the schistus mountains; but we find one of\r\nthose same veins in these secondary calcareous strata. Now, tho' we\r\nshould be disposed to allow, that, in the primordial mountain, of which\r\nwe are supposed not to know the origin, there might have been empty\r\ncrevices which were afterwards filled with materials transported by the\r\nsea, this cannot be admitted as taking place in the loose or incoherent\r\nmaterials deposited above the schistus. Consequently, this theory of our\r\nauthor, which is evidently erroneous with regard to the veins in the\r\nlime-stone, must, in the other case, be at least examined with a jealous\r\neye.\r\n\r\n\"Le haut de cette partie des montagnes _calcaires_ étoit encore\r\nrecouvert de _sable_ et de grès _vitrescibles_: et continuant à marcher,\r\nsans aucune inflexion sensible, nous nous trouvâmes subitement sur les\r\n_schistes_; d'où nous montâmes plus rapidement. Puis traversant quelques\r\npetites vallées nous arrivâmes sur les montagnes qui appartiennent au\r\nprolongement du _Brocken_ ou _Blocksberg_. La matière dominante est\r\nalors le _granit_; mais il est tout en blocs le long de cette route, et\r\nces blocs se trouvent à une telle distance de tout sommité intacte de\r\ncette pierre, qui est aisé de juger non seulement qu'ils ne sont pas\r\ndans leur place originaire, mais encore qu'il ne sont arrivés là par\r\naucune des causes naturelles qui agissent dans les montagnes; savoir,\r\nla pesanteur, la pente, et le cours des eaux. Ce sont donc de violentes\r\nexplosions qui ont dispersé ces blocs; et alors ils deviennent un\r\nnouveau trait cosmologique de quelque importance: car rien ne se meut,\r\nni ne paroît s'être mu depuis bien des siècles, dans ces lieux qui\r\nmontrent tant de désordre: un tapis de verdure couvre tout, en\r\nconservant les contours baroques du sol. Le bétail ne sauroit pâturer\r\ndans de telles prairies; mais l'industrieux montagnard fait y\r\nfaucher[29].\r\n\r\n[Note 29: M. de Saussure endeavours to explain those appearances of\r\ntransported blocks of granite by another cause; this is a certain\r\n_debacle_ of the waters of the earth, which I do not understand. M. de\r\nLuc again attempts to explain it by violent explosions; I suppose he\r\nmeans those of a volcano. But he has not given us the evidence upon\r\nwhich such an opinion may be founded, farther than by saying that those\r\nblocks could not have come there by the natural operations of the\r\nsurface. By this must be meant, that, from the nearest summit of\r\ngranite, there is not, at present, any natural means by which these\r\nblocks might be transported to that place. But it is not with the\r\npresent state of things that we are concerned, in explaining the\r\noperations of a distant period. If the natural operations of the surface\r\nchange the shape of things, as is clearly proved by every natural\r\nappearance, Why form an argument against a former transaction, upon the\r\ncircumstances of the present state of things? Our author does not\r\nseem to perceive, that, from this mode of reasoning, there is is an\r\ninsuperable objection to his violent explosions having been employed in\r\nproducing those effects. For, had there been such a cause, the evidence\r\nof this must have remained; if the surface of the earth does not undergo\r\ngreat changes: If, again, this surface be in time much changed, How can\r\nwe judge from the present shape, what might have been the former posture\r\nof things?\r\n\r\nThis author, indeed, does not allow much time for the natural operations\r\nof the globe to change its surface; but, if things be not greatly\r\nremoved from the state in which the violent operations of the globe had\r\nplaced them, Why does he not point out to us the source of this great\r\ndisorder which he there perceives? From what explosion will be explained\r\nthe blocks of granite which are found upon the Jura, and which must have\r\ncome from the mass of _Mont Blanc_? If these dispersed blocks of\r\nstone are to be explained by explosion, there must: have been similar\r\nexplosions in other countries where there is not the smallest appearance\r\nof volcanic eruptions; for, around all our granite mountains, and I\r\nbelieve all others, there are found many blocks of granite, traveled at\r\na great distance, and in all directions.]\r\n\r\n\"_Oberbruck_, ou nous avions été la précédente fois, se trouva sur notre\r\nroute, et nous y passames aussi la nuit, dans l'espérance de pouvoir\r\nmonter le lendemain sur le _Brocken_; mais il fut encore enveloppé de\r\nnuages; ainsi nous continuâmes à marcher vers _Clausthal_, passant de\r\nnouveau par le _Bruchberg_, où le _sable_ et ses gres recouvrent le\r\n_schiste_; puis arrivant à une autre sommité, nous y trouvâmes la même\r\npierre _sableuse_ par couches, mêlée de parcelles de _schiste_, que nous\r\navions vue sur les montagnes _calcaires d'Elbingerode_. Il est donc\r\ntoujours plus certain que le sol primordial de toutes ces montagnes\r\nexistoit sous les eaux de l'ancienne mer; puisqu'il est recouvert de\r\ndiverses fortes de dépôts, connus pour appartenir à la _mer_; et que les\r\n_fentes_ des _filons_ existoient dans cette _mer ancienne_; puisqu'elle\r\nen a rempli elle-même quelques unes, et qu'elle a recouvert de ses\r\ndépôts quelques autres _filons_ tout formés. Quant à celles des matières\r\nde ces _filons_, qui ne paroissent pas être _marines_ (et c'est de\r\nbeaucoup la plus grande quantité), j'ai toujours plus de penchant d'en\r\nattribuer une partie à l'opération des _feux souterreins_, à mesure que\r\nje vois diminuer la probabilité de les assigner entièrement à _l'eau_.\r\nMais quoi-qu'il en soit, ces gangues ne font pas de même date que les\r\nmontagnes[30].\r\n\r\n[Note 30: I most willingly admit the justness of our author's view, if\r\nhe thus perceives the operation of fire in the solids of our earth; but\r\nit is not for the reasons he has given us for discovering it here more\r\nthan in other places; for there is not a mineral vein, (so far at least\r\nas I have seen), in which the appearances may be explained by any thing\r\nelse besides the operation of fire or fusion. It is not easy to conceive\r\nin what manner our author had conceived the opinions which he has\r\ndisplayed in these letters. He had no opinion of this kind, or rather he\r\nwas persuaded that subterraneous fire had no hand in the formation of\r\nthis earth before he came to this place of the Hartz; here he finds\r\ncertain appearances, by which he is confirmed in his former opinion,\r\nthat water had operated in forming mineral veins; and then he forms the\r\nidea that subterraneous fire may have operated also. But, before the\r\ndiscovery of the chasms in the schistus mountains having been filled\r\nwith the stratified materials of the sea, How had he supposed veins to\r\nbe filled? If this philosopher had before no opinion of subterraneous\r\nfire, as instrumental in that operation, How comes he now to change that\r\nformer opinion? For, unless it be the extraordinary manner of filling\r\nthese open crevices in the mountains by matter deposited immediately\r\nfrom the sea, there is certainly no other appearance in this mineral\r\ncountry of the Hartz, that may not be found in any other, only perhaps\r\nupon a smaller scale.]\r\n\r\n\"Le lendemain de notre arrivée a _Clausthal_, qui étoit le 13e, nous\r\nallâmes visiter d'autres mines de _fer_ en montagnes secondaires,\r\nsituées au côté opposé du Hartz. Elles sont auprès de _Grund_ l'une\r\ndes _villes de mines_, et près du lieu ou sortira la nouvelle _galerie\r\nd'écoulement_ à laquelle on travaille, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Arrivés à _Grund_ les officiers mineurs vinrent, comme à l'ordinaire,\r\naccompagner Mons. de _Reden_ aux _mines_ de leur département. Celles-ci,\r\nsans être plus extraordinaires que celles qui nous avions vues à\r\n_Elbingerod_, ou sans aider mieux jusqu'ici à expliquer ce qu'elles ont\r\ntoutes d'extraordinaire, nous donnent au moins des indices probables\r\nde grands accidens. Ces montagnes de _Grund_ sont encore de l'espèce\r\nremarquable, dont la base est de _schiste_, et le haut de _pierre à\r\nchaux_. Les mines qu'on y exploit sont de _fer_, et se trouvent dans\r\ncette matière _calcaire_; mais elles y sont sous des apparences\r\ntout-à-fait étranges. La montagne où nous les vîmes principalement le\r\nnomme _Iberg_. On y poursuit des masses de _pierre à fer_, de l'ensemble\r\ndesquelles les mineurs ne peuvent encore se rendre compte d'une manière\r\nclaire. Ils ont trouvé dans cette montagne des _ca__vernes_, qui\r\nressemblent à l'encaissement de _sillons_ déjà exploités, ou non formés;\r\nc'est-à-dire, que ce sont des _fentes_ presque verticales, et vides, Le\r\n_minerai_ qu'ils poursuivent est en _Rognons_; c'est à dire, en grandes\r\nmasses sans continuité décidée. Cependant ces masses semblent se\r\nsuccéder dans la montagne suivant une certaine direction; tellement que\r\nles mineurs savent déjà les chercher, par des indices d'habitude.\r\nLa substance de cette _pierre à fer_ particulière renferme des\r\ncrystallizations de diverses espèces. Il y a des _druses de quartz_, ou\r\nde petits cristaux de quartz qui tapissent des cavités; il y a aussi du\r\n_spath_ commun, et de celui qu'on nomme pesant; on y trouve enfin une\r\nforte de crystallization nommée _Eisenman_ (_homme de fer_) par les\r\nmineurs; se sont des amas de cristaux noir-âtres, qui ressemblent à\r\ndes groupes de grandes lentilles plattes, et ces cristaux sont\r\n_ferrugineux_.\r\n\r\n\"Entre les signes de bouleversement que renferme ce lieu, est un\r\nrocher nommé _Gebichensten_, qui est en _pierre à chaux_, ce que\r\n_l'Ebrenbreitstein_ de _Coblentz_ est en pierre sableuse: c'est-à-dire,\r\nque ses _couches_, remplies de _corps marins_, sont presque verticales;\r\nceux de ces corps qu'on y trouve en plus grande quantité, sont des\r\n_madrépores_. Ce rocher s'élève comme un grand obélisque, au-dessus des\r\n_cavernes_, dont j'ai parlé; montrant par le côté ses _couches_, qui se\r\ntrouvent, comme je l'ai dit, dans une situation presque verticale. Sa\r\nbase est déjà bien minée, tant par les _cavernes_, que par la _pierre\r\nà fer_ qu'on en tire; et je ne me hasardai dessus, que parce que je me\r\ndis, qu'il y a des millions contre un à parier, que ce n'est pas le\r\nmoment où il s'enfoncerait. Mais je n'en dirois pas autant, s'il\r\ns'agissoit de m'y loger à demeure.\r\n\r\n\"Quoique tout ce lieu là soit fort remarquable, il se pourrait que ce\r\nne fut qu'un phénomène particulier. Les _cavernes_ peuvent devoir leur\r\norigine à la même cause que celle de Schartzfeld; et le dérangement des\r\nrochers supérieurs à des enfoncemens occasionnés par ces _cavernes_.\r\nRien n'est si difficile que de retracer aujourd'hui ces fortes\r\nd'accidens à cause des changemens que le tems y a opérés. S'ils sont\r\narrivés sous les eaux de la _mer_, on conçoit aisément les altérations\r\nqui ont dû succéder; et si c'est depuis que nos continens sont à sec,\r\nles eaux encore, tant intérieures qu'extérieures, et la végétation, en\r\nont beaucoup changé l'aspect.\"\r\n\r\nThis author has a theory by which he explains to himself the former\r\nresidence of the sea, above the summits of our mountains; this,\r\nhowever, is not the theory by which we are now endeavouring to explain\r\nappearances; we must therefore be allowed to reason from our own\r\nprinciples, in considering the facts here set forth by our author.\r\n\r\nNothing, I think, is more evident, than that in this mineral country of\r\nthe Hartz, we may find the clearest marks of fracture, elevation, and\r\ndislocation of the strata, and of the introduction of foreign matter\r\namong those separated bodies. All those appearances, our author would\r\nhave to be nothing but some particular accident, which is not to enter\r\ninto the physiology of the earth. I wish again to generalise these\r\nfacts, by finding them universal in relation to the globe, and\r\nnecessarily to be found in all the consolidated parts of our land.\r\n\r\nIt was not to refute our author's reasoning that I have here introduced\r\nso much of his observations, but to give an extensive view of the\r\nmineral structure of this interesting country. This therefore being\r\ndone, we now proceed to what is more peculiarly our business in this\r\nplace, or the immediate subject of investigation, viz. the distinction\r\nof primary and secondary strata.\r\n\r\n\"Dans le voisinage de cette montagne, il y a une autre fort\r\nintéressante, que je vis le jour suivant. Quoiqu'en traitant des\r\nvolcans, j'aie démontré que la formation des montagnes, par soulèvement,\r\nétoit sans exemple dans les faits, et sans fondement dans la théorie, je\r\nne laisseroi pas de m'arrêter au phénomène que présente cette montagne;\r\nparce qu'il prouvera directement que les _couches calcaires_ au moins,\r\nont été formées _à la hauteur ou elles sont_; c'est-a-dire qu'elles\r\nn'ont pas été soulevées.\r\n\r\n\"Voulant prendre l'occasion de mon retour à _Hanovre_, pour traverser\r\nles avant-corps du _Hartz_, dans quelque nouvelle direction; je résolus\r\nde faire ce voyage à cheval, et de prendre ma route droite vers\r\n_Hanovre_, au-travers des collines; ce qui me conduisit encore à _Grund_\r\npuis à _Münchehof Brunshausen, Engelade, Winsenburg_ et _Alfeld_, où\r\nenfin, traversant la _Leine_ j'entrai dans la grande route.\r\n\r\n\"Je quittai donc _Clausthal_ (et avec bien du regret) le 14 au matin;\r\net revenant d'abord à _Grund_, je le laissai sur ma droite, ainsi\r\nque _l'Iberg_; et plus loin, du même côté, une autre montagne nommée\r\n_Winterberg_ dont la base est _schiste_, et le sommet plus haut que\r\nClausthal, entièrement composé de _couches calcaires_. De _Grund_ je\r\nmontai vers une montagne nommée _Ost Kamp_; et je commençai là à donner\r\nune attention particulière au sol. Le long de mon chemin, je ne trouvai\r\nlongtemps que des schistes, qui montroient leurs points en haut, comme à\r\nl'ordinaire, et avec tous leurs tortillemens de feuillets. Mais arrivé\r\nau haut de la montagne, j'y vis des carrières de _pierre à chaux_, où\r\nles couches absolument régulières, et qui ont peu d'épaisseur sur le\r\n_schiste_ suivent parfaitement les contours du _sommet_. Ces lits de\r\n_pierre à chaux_ n'ont certainement pas été soulevés du fond de la _mer_\r\nsur le dos des schistes; lors même qu'à cause de la grande inclinaison\r\ndes feuillets de ceux-ci on voudroit le attribuer à quelque révolution\r\ntelle que le _soulèvement_; (ce que je n'admettrois point). Car si ces\r\nlits _calcaires_, ayant été faits au fond de la _mer_, avoyent été\r\nsoulevés avec les schistes, ne feroient-ils pas brisés et bouleversés\r\ncomme eux? Il est donc evident, que quoiqu'il soi arrivé au schiste qui\r\nles porte, ces lits, et tous les autres de même genre qui sont au haut\r\nde ces montagnes, ont été déposées au niveau où ils sont; et que\r\npar conséquent la _mer_ les surpassoit alors. Ainsi le système de\r\nsoulèvement perd son but, s'il tend à expliquer pourquoi nous avons des\r\n_couches_, formées par la mer, qui se trouvent maintenant si fort au\r\ndessus de son niveau. Il est évident que ces _couches_ n'ont pas été\r\nsoulevées; mais que la _mer_ s'est _abaissée_. Or c'est là le grand\r\npoint cosmologique à expliquer: tous les autres, qui tiennent à la\r\nstructure de certaines montagnes inintelligibles, n'appartiendront qu'à\r\n_l'histoire naturelle_, tant qu'ils ne se lieront pas avec celui-la.\"\r\n\r\nHere are two things to be considered; the interesting facts described\r\nby our author, and the inference that he would have us draw from those\r\nfacts. It would appear from the facts, that the body of schistus below,\r\nand that of lime-stone above, had not undergone the same disordering\r\noperations, or by no means in the same degree. But our author has formed\r\nanother conclusion; he says, that these lime-stone strata must have been\r\nformed precisely in the place and order in which they lie at present;\r\nand the reason for this is, because these strata appeared to him to\r\nfollow perfectly the contour of the summit of this mountain. Now, had\r\nthere been in the top of this mountain a deep hollow encompassed about\r\nwith the schistus rock; and had this cavity been now found filled with\r\nhorizontal strata, there might have been some shadow of reason for\r\nsupposing those strata to have been deposited upon the top of the\r\nmountain. But to suppose, _first_, that shells and corals should be\r\ndeposited upon the convex summit of a mountain which was then covered by\r\nthe sea; _secondly_, that these moveable materials should remain upon\r\nthe summit, while the sea had changed its place; and, _lastly_, that\r\nthose shells and corals left by the sea upon the top of a mountain\r\nshould become strata of solid limestone, and have also metallic veins\r\nin it, certainly holds of no principle of natural philosophy that I am\r\nacquainted with. If, therefore, such an appearance as this were to be\r\nemployed either in illustration or confirmation of a theory, it\r\nwould itself require to be explained; but this is a task that this\r\ncosmologists does not seem willing to undertake.\r\n\r\nHe has formed a hypothesis for explaining the general appearance of that\r\nwhich was once the bottom of the sea being now found forming the summits\r\nof our mountains; but surely this philosopher will acknowledge, that\r\nthose natural appearances, in any particular place, will be the same,\r\nwhether we suppose the bottom of the sea to have been raised, as in the\r\npresent theory, or the surface of the sea to have sunk according to his\r\nhypothesis. For, it is equally easy to suppose a portion of the earth\r\nto have been raised all this height, as to suppose all the rest of the\r\nsurface of the globe to have sunk an equal space, while a small portion\r\nof the bottom of the sea, remaining here and there fixed in its place,\r\nbecame the highest portion of the globe. Consequently, whatever evidence\r\nthis philosopher shall find in support of his theory of the present\r\nearth, (a subject which it is not our purpose to examine) it cannot be\r\nallowed that he has here brought any argument capable of disproving the\r\nelevation of the bottom of the sea; a supposition which other theories\r\nmay require.\r\n\r\nI would now observe, in relation to the present theory, that so far\r\nas this author has reasoned justly from natural appearances, his\r\nconclusions will be found to confirm the present supposition, that there\r\nis to be perceived the distinction of primordial, and that of secondary,\r\nin the masses of this earth, without altering the general theory either\r\nwith respect to the original formation of those masses, or to their\r\nposterior production.\r\n\r\nHere one of two things must be allowed; either that those strata\r\nof schistus had been broken and distorted under a mass of other\r\nsuperincumbent strata; or that those superincumbent strata had been\r\ndeposited upon the broken and distorted strata at the bottom of the sea.\r\nOur author, who has examined the subject, inclines to think, that this\r\nlast has been the case. If, therefore, strata had been deposited upon\r\nbroken and bare rocks of schistus, it is probable that these had been\r\nsunk in the sea after having been exposed to the atmosphere, and served\r\nthe purpose of land upon the globe.[31]\r\n\r\n[Note 31: This is also supported by another very interesting observation\r\ncontained in this letter. M. de Luc observes, that in this country the\r\nschistus is generally covered by strata of lime-stone, and that these\r\nlime-stone strata are again covered with those of sand-stone, in which\r\nare found a great many fragments of schistus lying flat. Therefore,\r\nwhile those sand-stone strata were collecting at the bottom of the sea,\r\nthere had been rocks of schistus in some other place, from whence those\r\nfragments bad been detached.]\r\n\r\nAn example of the same kind also occurs in the _Discours sur l'Histoire\r\nNaturelle de la Suisse_; and this author of the _Tableaux de la Suisse_\r\nhas given a very distinct description of that appearance, which is\r\nperhaps the more to be valued as a piece of natural history, as this\r\nintelligent author does not pretend to any geological theory, but simply\r\nnarrates what he has seen, with such pertinent observations on\r\nthe subject as naturally must occur to a thinking person on the\r\nspot.--(Discours, etc. page 228. Entrée au pays de Grisons).\r\n\r\n\"Du village d'Elen on continue à monter le reste du petit vallon pendant\r\nune lieue et demie parmi les mêmes espèces de pierres qu'on vient de\r\ndécrire; en passant au travers de bois et de forêts de sapins et de\r\nquelques pâturages dont ce haut est couvert, on parvient au pied du\r\nBundnerberg, montagne des grisons, qui forme la tête du vallon. On\r\nlaisse à droite un fond ou espèce d'entonnoir, entouré de très-hautes\r\nmontagnes inaccessibles, pour s'enfourrer à gauche entre des rochers qui\r\nfont fort resserrés, où coule un torrent. Ce lieu seroit horreur si\r\non ne se trouvoit accoutumé, par degrés, à voir de ces positions\r\neffrayantes: tout y est aride, il n'y a plus d'arbres ni de végétaux ce\r\nsont des rochers entassés les un sur les autres; ce lieu paroit d'autant\r\nplus affreux que le passage a été subit, et qu'en sortant de bois et des\r\nforêts, on se trouve tout-à-coup parmi ces rochers qui s'élèvent comme\r\ndes murailles, et dont on ne voit pas la cime; cette gorge ou cette\r\nentrée qui se nomme Jetz, est la communication du Canton du Glaris aux\r\nGritons; on a dit précédemment qu'il y en avoit une plus aisée par\r\nle Gros-Thal ou le grand vallon. Ce passage est très-curieux pour la\r\nLithogeognosie, il est rare de trouver autant de phénomènes intéressans\r\nrassemblés, et des substances aussi variées par rapport à leurs\r\npositions; c'est le local qui mérite le plus d'être examiné en Suisse,\r\net la plus difficile que nous ayons parcouru. On se souviendra que nous\r\navons continuellement monté depuis Glaris, et que nous nous trouvons au\r\npied de ces montagnes ou de ces pics étonnans qui dominent les hautes\r\nAlpes; on trouve ici la facilité peu commune de pouvoir examiner, et\r\nvoir le pied ou les fondemens de ces colosses qui couronnent le globe,\r\nparce qu'ils sont ordinairement entourés de leurs débris et de leurs\r\néboulemens qui en cachent le pied. Ici c'est une roche de schiste\r\nbleuâtre, dure et compact, traversée de filons de quartz blanc, et\r\nquelquefois jaunâtre, dans laquelle on a taillé un sentier pour pouvoir\r\nen franchir le pied. Cette roche s'élève à une hauteur prodigieuse,\r\nest presque verticale, et ces couches sont à quatre-vingt degrés\r\nd'inclinaison. L'imagination est effrayée de voir que de pareilles\r\nmasses ayent pu être ébranlées et déplacées au point d'avoir fait\r\npresque un quart de conversion. Après avoir monté et suivi cette roche\r\nparmi les pierres et les décombres, une heure et demie, on trouve\r\ncette roche de schiste surmontée d'autres rochers fort hauts qui sont\r\ncalcaires, et dont les lits sont fort horizontaux. Les schistes,\r\nqui sont directement sous les roches calcaires, conservent la même\r\ninclinaison qu'elles ont à leur pied.\"\r\n\r\nHere is an observation which certainly agrees with that given by M. de\r\nLuc, and would seem to confirm this conclusion, that strata had been\r\ndeposited upon those _schisti_ after they had been changed from their\r\nnatural or horizontal position, and become vertical; at the same time,\r\nthis conclusion is not of necessary consequence, without examining\r\nconcomitant appearances, and finding particular marks by which this\r\noperation might be traced; for the simply finding horizontal strata,\r\nplaced above vertical or much inclined schiste, is not sufficient, of\r\nitself, to constitute that fact, while it is acknowledged that every\r\nspecies of fracture, dislocation, and contortion, is to be found among\r\nthe displaced strata of the globe.\r\n\r\nSince writing this chapter, I am enabled to speak more decisively upon\r\nthat point, having acquired more light upon the subject, as will appear\r\nin the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nThe Theory of interchanging Sea and Land illustrated by an\r\nInvestigation of the Primary and Secondary Strata.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.--A distinct View of the Primary and Secondary Strata.\r\n\r\nHaving given a view of what seems to be the primary and secondary\r\nstrata, from the observations of authors, and having given what was\r\nmy opinion when I first wrote that chapter, I am now to treat of this\r\nsubject from observations of my own, which I made since forming that\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nFrom Portpatrick, on the west coast, to St Abb's Head, on the east,\r\nthere is a tract of schistus mountains, in which the strata are\r\ngenerally much inclined, or approaching to the vertical situation; and\r\nit is in these inclined strata that geologists allege that there is not\r\nto be found any vestige of organised body. This opinion, however, I have\r\nnow proved to be erroneous.\r\n\r\nThere cannot be any doubt with regard to the original formation of those\r\nstratified bodies, as having been formed of the materials that are\r\nnatural to this earth, viz. the detritus of former bodies; and as having\r\nbeen deposited in water, like the horizontal strata: For the substances\r\nand bodies of which they are visibly composed are no other than those\r\nwhich form the most regular horizontal strata, and which are continually\r\ntraveling, or transported at the bottom of the sea, such as gravel, and\r\nsand, argillaceous and micaceous bodies.\r\n\r\nOn each side of this ridge of mountains, which towards the east end is\r\nbut narrow, there is a lower country composed of strata in general more\r\nhorizontal; and among which strata, besides coal, there are also found\r\nthe relics of organised bodies.\r\n\r\nAbstracting at present from any consideration of organised bodies among\r\nthe materials of those strata, it may be affirmed, that the materials\r\nwhich form the strata in the mountains and in the low country, are\r\nsimilar, or of the same nature; that they have, in both places, been\r\nconsolidated by the same means, viz. heat and fusion; and that the same\r\nor similar accidents have happened to them, such as change from their\r\noriginal position, and mineral veins traversing them in various shapes.\r\nYet still there is a distinctive character for those two bodies, the\r\nalpine and the horizontal strata; for, while the horizontal position\r\nappears natural to the one, and the changes from that particular state\r\nto be only an accident, the vertical position appears to be more natural\r\nto the other, which is seldom found horizontal.\r\n\r\nTherefore, altho' it is unquestionable that the strata in the alpine and\r\nlow countries had the same or a similar original, yet, as the vertical\r\nposition, which is the greatest possible change in that respect, is more\r\nnatural to the alpine strata, or only necessary in the natural order of\r\nthose bodies, we are to consider this great disorder or change from the\r\nnatural state of their original formation, as the proper character of\r\nthose alpine strata. But then it is also necessary to include in this\r\ncharacter a general hardness and solidity in those vertical strata,\r\notherwise they would not have been properly alpine, or have resisted the\r\nwearing and washing powers of the globe, so as to have remained higher\r\nthan the others; for, the vertical position, or great inclination of\r\nthose strata, should rather have disposed them the more to dissolution\r\nand decay. Let us now see how far we shall be justified in that general\r\nconclusion, by the examination of those bodies.\r\n\r\nThe fact is certain, that those alpine bodies are much harder, or less\r\nsubject to dissolution and decay, than the horizontal strata. But this\r\nmust be taken in the general, and will by no means apply to particular\r\ncases which might be compared. Nothing, for example, more solid than the\r\nlime-stones, or marbles, and iron-stones; nothing more hard or solid\r\nthan the chirt or flint; and all these are found among the horizontal\r\nstrata. But, while some strata among those horizontal beds are\r\nthus perfectly solid, others are found with so slight degrees of\r\nconsolidation, that we should not be able to ascribe it to the proper\r\ncause, without that gradation of the effect, which leads us to impute\r\nthe slightest degree of consolidation to the same operations that have\r\nproduced the complete solidity. While, therefore, the most perfect\r\nsolidity is found in certain strata, or occasionally among the\r\nhorizontal bodies, this forms no part of their character in general, or\r\ncannot be considered as a distinctive mark, as it truly is with\r\nregard to the alpine strata. These last have a general character of\r\nconsolidation and indissolubility, which is in a manner universal. We\r\nare, therefore, now to inquire into the cause of this distinction, and\r\nto form some hypothesis that may be tried by the actual state of things,\r\nin being compared with natural appearances.\r\n\r\nAs the general cause of consolidation among mineral bodies, formed\r\noriginally of loose materials, has been found to consist in certain\r\ndegrees of fusion or cementation of those materials by means of heat;\r\nand as, in the examination of the horizontal strata we actually\r\nfind very different degrees of consolidation in the several strata,\r\nindependent of their positions in relation to height or depth, we have\r\nreason to believe that the heat, or consolidating operation, has not\r\nbeen equally employed in relation to them all.\r\n\r\nWe are not now inquiring how an inferior stratum should have been heated\r\nin a lesser degree, or not consolidated, while a superior stratum had\r\nbeen consolidated in the most perfect manner; we are to reason upon a\r\nfact, which is, that the horizontal strata in general appear not to have\r\nbeen equally or universally consolidated; and this we must attribute to\r\nan insufficient exertion of the consolidating cause. But, so far as the\r\nerecting cause is considered as the same with that by which the elevated\r\nbodies were consolidated, and so far as the vertical situation is a\r\nproof of the great exertion of that subterraneous power, the strata\r\nwhich are most erected, should in general be found most consolidated.\r\n\r\nNothing more certain than that there have been several repeated\r\noperations of the mineralising power exerted upon the strata\r\nin particular places; and all those mineral operations tend to\r\nconsolidation: Therefore, the more the operations have been repeated in\r\nany place, the more we should find the strata consolidated, or changed\r\nfrom their natural state. Vertical strata have every appearance from\r\nwhence we should be led to conclude, that much of the mineral power\r\nhad been exerted upon them, in changing their original constitution or\r\nappearance. But the question now to be considered is this, How far\r\nit may appear that these masses of matter, which now seem to be so\r\ndifferent from the ordinary strata of the globe, had been twice\r\nsubjected to the mineral operations, in having been first consolidated\r\nand erected into the place of land, and afterwards sunk below the\r\nbottom of the sea, in order a second time to undergo the process of\r\nsubterraneous heat, and again be elevated into the place where they now\r\nare found.\r\n\r\nIt must be evident, here is a question that may not be easy to decide.\r\nIt is not to the degree of any change to which bodies may be subject,\r\nthat we are to appeal, in order to clear up the point in question,\r\nbut to a regular course of operations, which must appear to have been\r\nsuccessively transacted, and by which the different circumstances or\r\nsituations of those masses are to be discovered in their present state.\r\nNow, though it does not concern the present theory that this question be\r\ndecided, as it is nothing but a repetition of the same operations that\r\nwe look for; nevertheless, it would be an interesting fact in the\r\nnatural history of this earth; and it would add great lustre to a theory\r\nby which so great, so many operations were to be explained. I am far\r\nfrom being sanguine in my expectations of giving all the satisfaction\r\nin relation to this subject that I could wish; but it will be proper to\r\nstate what I have lately learned with regard to so curious a question,\r\nthat others, who shall have the opportunity, may be led to inquire, and\r\nthat thus the natural history of the earth may be enlarged, by a proper\r\ninvestigation of its mineral operations.\r\n\r\nWith this view I have often considered our schistus mountains, both in\r\nthe north and south; but I never found any satisfactory appearance from\r\nwhence conclusions could be formed, whether for the question or against\r\nit. The places I examined were those between the alpine countries and\r\nthe horizontal strata; here, indeed, I have frequently found a confused\r\nmass, formed of the fragments of those alpine strata mixed with the\r\nmaterials of the horizontal bodies; but not having seen the proper shape\r\nand connection of those several deposits, I always suspended my judgment\r\nwith regard to the particular operations which might have been employed\r\nin producing those appearances.\r\n\r\nI had long looked for the immediate junction of the secondary or low\r\ncountry strata with the alpine schistus, without finding it; the first\r\nplace in which I observed it was at the north end of the island of\r\nArran, at the mouth of Loch Ranza; it was upon the shore, where the\r\ninclined strata appeared bare, being; washed by the sea. It was but a\r\nvery small part that I could see; but what appeared was most distinct.\r\nHere the schistus and the sandstone strata both rise inclined at an\r\nangle of about 45°; but these primary and secondary strata were inclined\r\nin almost opposite directions; and thus they met together like the\r\ntwo sides of a _lambda_, or the rigging of a house, being a little in\r\ndisorder at the angle of their junction. From this situation of those\r\ntwo different masses of strata, it is evidently impossible that either\r\nof them could have been formed originally in that position; therefore, I\r\ncould not here learn in what state the schistus strata had been in when\r\nthose of the sand-stone, &c, had been superinduced.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of my mind, in relation to that subject:, when at\r\nJedburgh upon a visit to a friend, after I had returned from Arran, and\r\nwrote the history of that journey; I there considered myself as among\r\nthe horizontal strata which had first appeared after passing the Tweed,\r\nand before arriving at the Tiviot. The strata there, as in Berwickshire,\r\nwhich is their continuation to the east, are remarkably horizontal for\r\nScotland; and they consist of alternated beds of sand-stone and marl, or\r\nargillaceous and micaceous strata. These horizontal strata are traversed\r\nin places with small veins of whin-stone, as well as greater masses\r\nforming rocks and hills of that material; but, except it be these, (of\r\nwhich there are some curious examples), I thought there could be nothing\r\nmore of an interesting nature to observe. Chance, however, discovered to\r\nme what I could not have expected or foreseen.\r\n\r\nThe river Tweed, below Melrose, discovers in its bed the vertical strata\r\nof the schistus mountains, and though here these indurated bodies are\r\nnot veined with quartz as in many places of the mountains, I did not\r\nhesitate to consider them as the same species, that is to say, the marly\r\nmaterials indurated and consolidated in those operations by which they\r\nhad been so much changed in their place and natural position. Afterwards\r\nin travelling south, and seeing the horizontal softer strata, I concluded\r\nthat I had got out of the alpine country, and supposed that no more of\r\nthe vertical strata were to be observed.\r\n\r\nThe river Tiviot has made a wide valley as might have been expected, in\r\nrunning over thole horizontal strata of marly or decaying substances;\r\nand the banks of this river declining gradually are covered with gravel\r\nand soil, and show little of the solid strata of the country. This,\r\nhowever, is not the case with the Jed, which is to the southward of the\r\nTiviot; that river, in many places, runs upon the horizontal strata, and\r\nundermines steep banks, which falling shows high and beautiful sections\r\nof the regular horizontal strata. The little rivulets also which fall\r\ninto the Jed have hollowed out deep gullies in the land, and show the\r\nuniformity of the horizontal strata.\r\n\r\nIn this manner I was disposed to look for nothing more than what I had\r\nseen among those mineral bodies, when one day, walking in the beautiful\r\nvalley above the town of Jedburgh, I was surprised with the appearance\r\nof vertical strata in the bed of the river, where I was certain that\r\nthe banks were composed of horizontal strata. I was soon satisfied with\r\nregard to this phenomenon, and rejoiced at my good fortune in stumbling\r\nupon an object so interesting to the natural history of the earth, and\r\nwhich I had been long looking for in vain.\r\n\r\nHere the vertical strata, similar to those that are in the bed of\r\nthe Tweed, appear; and above those vertical strata, are placed the\r\nhorizontal beds, which extend along the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe question which we would wish to have solved is this; if the vertical\r\nstrata had been broken and erected under the superincumbent horizontal\r\nstrata; or if, after the vertical strata had been broken and erected,\r\nthe horizontal strata had been deposited upon the vertical strata,\r\nthen forming the bottom of the sea. That strata, which are regular and\r\nhorizontal in one place, should be found bended, broken, or disordered\r\nat another, is not uncommon; it is always found more or less in all our\r\nhorizontal strata. Now, to what length this disordering operation might\r\nhave been carried, among strata under others, without disturbing the\r\norder and continuity of those above, may perhaps be difficult to\r\ndetermine; but here, in this present case, is the greatest disturbance\r\nof the under strata, and a very great regularity among those above. Here\r\nat least is the most difficult case of this kind to conceive, if we are\r\nto suppose that the upper strata had been deposited before those below\r\nhad been broken and erected.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose that the under strata had been disordered at the\r\nbottom of the sea, before the superincumbent bodies were deposited; it\r\nis not to be well conceived, that the vertical strata should in that\r\ncase appear to be cut off abruptly, and present their regular edges\r\nimmediately under the uniformly deposited substances above. But, in the\r\ncase now under consideration, there appears the most uniform section\r\nof the vertical strata, their ends go up regularly to the horizontal\r\ndeposited bodies. Now, in whatever state the vertical strata had been in\r\nat the time of this event, we can hardly suppose that they could have\r\nbeen so perfectly cut off, without any relict being left to trace that\r\noperation. It is much more probable to suppose, that the sea had washed\r\naway the relics of the broken and disordered strata, before those that\r\nare now superincumbent had been begun to be deposited. But we cannot\r\nsuppose two such contrary operations in the same place, as that of\r\ncarrying away the relics of those broken strata, and the depositing of\r\nsand and subtile earth in such a regular order. We are therefore led\r\nto conclude, that the bottom of the sea, or surface of those erected\r\nstrata, had been in very different situations at those two periods, when\r\nthe relics of the disordered strata had been carried away, and when the\r\nnew materials had been deposited.\r\n\r\nIf this shall be admitted as a just view of the subject, it will be fair\r\nto suppose, that the disordered strata had been raised more or less\r\nabove the surface of the ocean; that, by the effects of either rivers,\r\nwinds, or tides, the surface of the vertical strata had been washed\r\nbare; and that this surface had been afterwards sunk below the influence\r\nof those destructive operations, and thus placed in a situation proper\r\nfor the opposite effect, the accumulation of matter prepared and put in\r\nmotion by the destroying causes.\r\n\r\nI will not pretend to say that this has all the evidence that should be\r\nrequired, in order to constitute a physical truth, or principle from\r\nwhence we were to reason farther in our theory; but, as a simple fact,\r\nthere is more probability for the thing having happened in that manner\r\nthan in any other; and perhaps this is all that may be attained, though\r\nnot all that were to be wished on the occasion. Let us now see how\r\nfar any confirmation may be obtained from the examination of all the\r\nattending circumstances in those operations.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned, that I had long observed great masses of\r\n_debris_, or an extremely coarse species of pudding-stone, situated on\r\nthe south as well as north sides of those schistus mountains, where the\r\nalpine strata terminate in our view, and where I had been looking for\r\nthe connection of those with the softer strata of the low country.\r\nIt has surely been such appearances as these which have often led\r\nnaturalists to see the formation of secondary and tertiary strata formed\r\nby the simple congestion of _debris_ from the mountains, and to suppose\r\nthose masses consolidated by the operation of that very element by which\r\nthey had been torn off from one place and deposited in another. I never\r\nbefore had data from whence to reason with regard to the natural history\r\nof those masses of gravel and sand which always appeared to me in an\r\nirregular shape, and not attended with such circumstances as might give\r\nlight into their natural history; but now I have found what I think\r\nsufficient to explain those obscure appearances, and which at the same\r\ntime will in some respect illustrate or confirm the conjecture which\r\nhas now been formed with regard to the operations of the globe in those\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nIn describing the vertical and horizontal strata of the Jed, no mention\r\nhas been made of a certain pudding-stone, which is interposed between\r\nthe two, lying immediately upon the one and under the other. This\r\npuddingstone corresponds entirely to that which I had found along\r\nthe skirt of the schistus mountains upon the south side, in different\r\nplaces, almost from one end to the other. It is a confused mass of\r\nstones, gravel, and sand, with red marly earth; these are consolidated\r\nor cemented in a considerable degree, and thus form a stratum extremely\r\nunlike any thing which is to be found either above or below.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine the stones and gravel of which it is composed, these\r\nappear to have belonged to the vertical strata or schistus mountains.\r\nThey are in general the hard and solid parts of those indurated\r\nstrata, worn and rounded by attrition; particularly sand or marl-stone\r\nconsolidated and veined with quartz, and many fragments of quartz, all\r\nrounded by attrition. In this pudding-stone of the Jed, I find also\r\nrounded lumps of porphyry, but have not perceived any of granite.[32]\r\nThis however is not the case in the pudding-stone of the schistus\r\nmountains, for, where there is granite in the neighbourhood, there is\r\nalso granite in the pudding-stone.\r\n\r\n[Note 32: A view of this object is seen in plate 3d. It is from a\r\ndrawing taken by Mr Clerk of Eldin.]\r\n\r\nFrom this it will appear, that the schistus mountains or the vertical\r\nstrata of indurated bodies had been formed, and had been wasted and worn\r\nin the natural operations of the globe, before the horizontal strata\r\nwere begun to be deposited in those places; the gravel formed of those\r\nindurated broken bodies worn round by attrition evince that fact. But\r\nit also appears that the mineral operations of the globe, melting and\r\nconsolidating bodies, had been exerted upon those deposited strata above\r\nthe vertical bodies.\r\n\r\nThis appears evidently from the examination of our pudding-stone. The\r\nvertical strata under it are much broken and injected with ferruginous\r\nspar; and this same spar has greatly penetrated the pudding-stone above,\r\nin which are found the various mineral appearances of that spar and iron\r\nore.\r\n\r\nBut those injecting operations reach no farther up among the marl strata\r\nin this place; and then would appear to have been confined to the\r\npudding-stone. But in another place, about half a mile farther up the\r\nriver, where a very deep section of the strata is discovered, there\r\nare two injections from below; the one is a thin vein of whin-stone or\r\nbasaltes, full of round particles of steatites impregnated with copper;\r\nit is but a few inches wide, and proceeds in a kind of zigzag. The other\r\nappears to have been calcareous spar, but the greatest part of it is now\r\ndissolved out. The strata here descend to the bottom of the river, which\r\nis above the place of the pudding-stone and vertical strata. Neither are\r\nthese last discoverable below the town of Jedburgh, at least so far as\r\nI have seen; and the line of division, or plane of junction of the\r\nvertical and horizontal strata, appears to decline more than the bed of\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, how the horizontal strata above, among which are\r\nmany very strong beds, have been consolidated. The answer to this\r\nquestion is plain. Those strata have been indurated or consolidated\r\nin no other manner than the general strata of the earth; these being\r\nactually the common strata of the globe; while the vertical or schistus\r\nstrata are the ordinary strata still farther manufactured, (if we may be\r\nallowed the expression) in the vicissitude of things, and by the mineral\r\noperations of the globe. That those operations have been performed by\r\nsubterraneous heat has been already proved; but I would now mention some\r\nparticular appearances which are common or general to those strata, and\r\nwhich can only be explained upon that principle.\r\n\r\nThe red marly earth is prevalent among those strata; and it is with this\r\nred ferruginous substance that many of the sand-stone strata are tinged.\r\nIt is plain that there had been an uniform, deposits of that sand and\r\ntinging earth; and that, however different matter might be successively\r\ndeposited, yet that each individual stratum should be nearly of the same\r\ncolour or appearance, so far as it had been formed uniformly of the same\r\nsubsiding matter. But, in the most uniform strata of red sand-stone,\r\nthe fracture of the stone presents us with circular spots of a white or\r\nbluish colour; those little spheres are in all respects the same with\r\nthe rest of the stone, they only want the tinging matter; and now it may\r\nbe inquired how this has come about.\r\n\r\nTo say that sphericles of white sand should have been formed by\r\nsubsiding along with the red sand and earth which composed the uniform\r\nstratum whether of sand-stone or marl, (for it happens equally in both,)\r\nis plainly impossible, according to our notion of that operation in\r\nwhich there is nothing mysterious. Those foliated strata, which are of\r\nthe most uniform nature, must have been gradually accumulated from the\r\nsubsiding sand and earth; and the white or colourless places must have\r\nhad their colour destroyed in the subsequent cementing operations. It\r\nis often apparent, that the discharging operation had proceeded from a\r\ncentre, as some small matter may be perceived in that place. I know not\r\nwhat species of substance this has been, whether saline or phlogistic,\r\nbut it must have had the power of either volatilising or changing the\r\nferruginous or red tinging substance so as to make it lose its colour.\r\n\r\nI have only mentioned spherical spots for distinctness sake; but this\r\ndischarging operation is found diversifying those strata in various\r\nways, but always referable to the same or similar causes. Thus, in many\r\nof the veins or natural cracks of those strata, we find the colour\r\ndischarged for a certain space within the strata; and we often see\r\nseveral of those spots united, each of them having proceeded from its\r\nown centre, and uniting where they approached. In the two veins above\r\nmentioned, of whin-stone and spar traversing the strata, the colour of\r\nthe strata is, discharged more or less in the places contiguous with the\r\nveins.\r\n\r\nI am now to mention another appearance of a different kind. Those strata\r\nof marl are in general not much consolidated; but among, them there\r\nare sometimes found thin calcareous strata extremely consolidated,\r\nconsequently much divided by veins. It is in the solid parts of those\r\nstrata, perfectly disconnected from the veins, that there are frequent\r\ncavities curiously lined with crystals of different sorts, generally\r\ncalcareous, sometimes containing also those that are siliceous, and\r\noften accompanied with pyrites. I am persuaded that the origin of those\r\ncavities may have been some hollow shells, such as _echini_ or some\r\nmarine object; but that calcareous body has been so changed, that it is\r\nnot now distinguishable; therefore, at present, I hold this opinion only\r\nas conjecture.\r\n\r\nHaving, in my return to Edinburgh, traveled up the Tiviot, with a view\r\nto investigate this subject of primary and secondary operations of the\r\nearth, I found the vertical strata, or alpine schistus, in the bed of\r\nthe river about two miles below Hawick. This was the third time I had\r\nseen those vertical bodies after leaving the mountains of Lauderdale.\r\nThe first place was the bed of the river Tweed, at the new bridge below\r\nMelrose; but here no other covering is to be seen above those vertical\r\nstrata besides the soil or traveled earth which conceals every thing\r\nexcept the rock in the bed of the river. The second place was Jedburgh,\r\nwhere I found the vertical strata covered with the horizontal sandstone\r\nand marl, as has been now described. The third place was the Tiviot, and\r\nthis is that which now remains to be considered.\r\n\r\nSeeing the vertical strata in the bed of the river, I was desirous to\r\nknow if those were immediately covered with the horizontal strata. This\r\ncould not be discovered in the bed of the river where the rock was\r\ncovered upon the banks with travelled earth. I therefore left the river,\r\nand followed the course of a brook which comes from the south side. I\r\nhad not gone far up the bank, or former boundary of the Tiviot, when\r\nI had the satisfaction to find the vertical strata covered with the\r\npudding-stone and marly beds as in the valley of the Jed.\r\n\r\nIt will now be reasonable to suppose that all the schistus which we\r\nperceive, whether in the mountains or in the valleys, exposed to our\r\nview had been once covered with those horizontal strata which are\r\nobserved in Berwickshire and Tiviotdale; and that, below all those\r\nhorizontal strata in the level country, there is at present a body or\r\nbasis of vertical or inclined schistus, on which the horizontal strata\r\nof a secondary order had been deposited. This is the conclusion that I\r\nhad formed at Jedburgh, before I had seen the confirmation of it in the\r\nTiviot; it is the only one that can be formed according to this view of\r\nthings; and it must remain in the present state until more evidence be\r\nfound by which the probability may be either increased or diminished.\r\n\r\nSince writing this, I have read, in the Esprit de Journaux, an abstract\r\nof a memoir of M. Voigt, upon the same subject, which I shall now\r\ntranscribe.\r\n\r\n\"La mer a commencé par miner les montagnes primitives dont les débris se\r\nsont précipités au fond. Ces débris forment la premiere couche qui est\r\nposée immédiatement sur les montagnes primitives. D'après l'ancien\r\nlangage de mineurs, nous avons jusqu'aujourd'hui appellé cette couche\r\n_le sol mort rouge_, parce qu'il y a beaucoup de rouge dans son mélange,\r\nqu'elle forme le sol ou la base d'autres couches, et peut-être de\r\ntoutes, qu'elle est entierement inutile et, en quelque facon, morte pour\r\nl'exploitation des mines. Plusieurs se sont efforcés de lui donner un\r\nnom harmonieux; mais ils ne l'ont pu sans occasionner des équivoques.\r\nLes mots _Brèche Puddinstone Conglomérations_, &_c_. désignent toujours\r\ndes substances autres que cette espèce de pierre.\r\n\r\n\"Il est très agréable de l'examiner dans les endroits où elle forme des\r\nmontagnes entières. Cette couche est composée d'une quantité prodigieuse\r\nde pierres arrondies, agglutinées ensemble par une substance argileuse\r\nrouge et même grise, et le toute a acquis assez de dureté. On ne trouve\r\ndans sa composition aucune espèce de pierre qui, à en juger par les\r\nmeilleures observations, puisse avoir été formée plus tard qu'elle;\r\non n'y voit par-tout que des parties et des produit des montagnes\r\nprimitives principalement de celles qui abondent le plus dans ces\r\ncontrées. Le sol mort, par exemple, qui compose les montagnes des\r\nenvirons de Walbourg, près d'Eisenach, contient une quantité de gros\r\nmorceaux de granit et de schiste micacé; c'est vraisemblablement parce\r\nque les montagnes primitives les plus voisines de Rhula, etc. sont,\r\npour la plus part, formées de ces deux espèces de pierres. Près de\r\nGoldlauter, le sol mort consiste presque tout en porphyre, substance\r\ndont sont formées les montagnes primitives qui y dominent; et le\r\nKiffauserberg dans la Thuringe a probablement reçu ces morceaux arrondis\r\nde schiste argileux des montagnes voisine du Hartz. Vous trouverez\r\nici que le schiste argileux existoit déjà lorsque la mer a jetté les\r\npremiers fondemens de nos montagnes stratifiées. Je serois fort étonné\r\nque quelqu'un me montrât un sol mort qui contînt un morceaux de gypse,\r\nde marne, de pierre puante et autres. Quoiqu'il en soit il n'est pas\r\naisé d'expliquer pourquoi on ne trouve point de corps marins pétrifiés\r\ndans cette espèce de pierre. C'est peut-être que, par l'immense quantité\r\nde pierres dures roulées dans le fond de la mer, ils ont été brisés\r\navant qu'ils aient commencé de s'agglutiner ensemble. Mais on rencontre\r\nsur-tout au Kiffhauserberg des troncs d'arbres entiers pétrifiés; preuve\r\nqu'il y avoit déjà ou de la végétation avant que l'océan destructeur se\r\nfût emparé de ces cantons, ou du moins que quelques isles avoient existé\r\nau-dessus de la surface.\"\r\n\r\nHere we find the same observations in the mountains of Germany that\r\nI have been making with regard to those of Scotland. I have formerly\r\nobserved masses of the same kind in the west of England, to the east of\r\nthe Severn; but I could not discover any proper connection of that mass\r\nwith the regular strata. I have also long observed it in many parts of\r\nScotland, without being able to attain a sufficiently satisfactory idea\r\nwith regard to those particulars by which the alternation of land and\r\nwater, of the superficial and internal mineral operations of the globe,\r\nmight be investigated.\r\n\r\nIt will be very remarkable if similar appearances are always found upon\r\nthe junction of the alpine with the level countries. Such an appearance,\r\nI am inclined to think, may be found in the Val d'Aoste, near Yvrée. M.\r\nde Saussure describes such a stone as having been employed in building\r\nthe triumphal arch erected in honour of Augustus. \"Cet arc qui étoit\r\nanciennement revêtu de marbre, est construit de grands quartiers d'une\r\nespèce assez singulière de poudingue ou de grès à gros grains. C'est une\r\nassemblage de fragmens, presque touts angulaires, de toutes sortes de\r\nroches primitives feuilletées, quartzeuses, micacées; les plus gros de\r\nces fragmens n'atteignent pas le volume, d'une noisette. La plupart des\r\nédifices antiques de la cité l'Aoste et de ses environs, sont construits\r\nde cette matière; et les gens du pays sont persuadés que c'est une\r\ncomposition; mais j'en ai trouvé des rochers en place dans les montagnes\r\nau nord et au-dessus de la route d'Yvrée.\"\r\n\r\nWe may now come to this general conclusion, that, in this example of\r\nhorizontal and posterior strata placed upon the vertical _schisti_ which\r\nare prior in relation to the former, we obtain a further view into the\r\nnatural history of this earth, more than what appears in the simple\r\nsuccession of one stratum above another. We know, in general, that all\r\nthe solid parts of this earth, which come to our view, have either\r\nbeen formed originally by subsidence at the bottom of the sea, or been\r\ntransfused in a melted state from the mineral regions among those solid\r\nbodies; but here we further learn, that the indurated and erected\r\nstrata, after being broken and washed by the moving waters, had again\r\nbeen sunk below the sea, and had served as a bottom or basis on which to\r\nform a new structure of strata; and also, that those new or posterior\r\nstrata had been indurated or cemented by the consolidating operations\r\nof the mineral region, and elevated from the bottom of the sea into the\r\nplace of land, or considerably above the general surface of the waters.\r\nIt is thus that we may investigate particular operations in the general\r\nprogress of nature, which has for object to renovate the surface of the\r\nearth necessarily wasted in the operation of a world sustaining plants\r\nand animals.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to compare together every thing of this kind which\r\noccurs; it is first necessary to ascertain the fact of their being a\r\nprior and posterior formation of strata, with the mineral operations\r\nfor consolidating those bodies formed by collection of the moveable\r\nmaterials; and, secondly, it is interesting to acquire all the data we\r\ncan in order to form a distinct judgment of that progress of nature in\r\nwhich the solid body of our land is alternately removed from the bottom\r\nof the sea into the atmosphere, and sunk again at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nI shall now transcribe what M. Schreiber has wrote in relation to\r\nthis subject. It is in a memoir concerning the gold mine of Gardette,\r\npublished in the Journal de Physique.\r\n\r\n\"Avant de quitter la montagne de la Gardette qu'il me soit permis de\r\nrapporter une observation qui peut-être n'est pas dénuée de tout\r\nintérêt pour les naturalistes; je l'ai faite dans une galerie à environ\r\ncinquante-trois toises à l'ouest du principal puit laquelle a été\r\npoussée sur la ligne de réunion de la pierre calcaire, et du granit\r\nfeuilleté ou gneiss pour fonder le filon dans cet endroit. Ce filon\r\na six pouces d'épaisseur, et consiste en quartz entre-mêlé d'ochre\r\nmartiale, de pyrite cuivreuse et galène. Cette dernière est souvent\r\nrecouverte de chaux de plomb grise, et de petits cristaux de mine de\r\nplomb jaune donnant dans l'analyse un indice d'or. Ce filon finit à la\r\nréunion de la pierre calcaire au gneiss. Cette réunion se fait ici dans\r\nla direction d'une heure 6/8 de la boussole de raineur, et sous un\r\ninclinaison, occidentale de 26 degrés.\r\n\r\n\"Mais ce qu'il y a de remarquable, c'est que le gneis ne participe en\r\nrien de la pierre calcaire quoiqu'il n'en soit séparé que par une couche\r\nd'une pouce d'épaisseur de terre argileuse et calcaire, tandis que le\r\nrocher calcaire renferme beaucoup de fragmens de granit et de gneis,\r\ndans le voisinage de cette réunion.\r\n\r\n\"Cette observation prouve incontestablement que le granit et le gneis\r\navoient déjà acquis une dureté capable de résister aux infiltration\r\ndes parties calcaire, et qu'ils existoient à-peu-près tels qu'ils sont\r\naujourd'hui lorsque la pierre calcaire commença à se former; autrement\r\nelle n'auroit pu saisir et envelopper des morceaux détachés de ces\r\nrochers auxquels on donne avec raison l'épithète de primitif ou de\r\npremière formation.\"\r\n\r\nM. Schreiber continues his reasoning upon those mineral appearances, in\r\nadducing another argument, which I do not think equally conclusive. He\r\nsays, \"Le filon de la Gardette devoit pareillement exister avant la\r\nmontagne calcaire, car s'il s'étoit formé apres, je ne voit pas la\r\nraison pour laquelle il s'y seroit arrêté court, et pourquoi il ne se\r\nseroit pas prolongé dans cette espèce de rocher.\" It is not necessary,\r\nin the formation of a vein, that it should proceed in traversing all the\r\nstrata which then are superincumbent; it is reasonable to suppose, and\r\nconsistent with observation to find them stop short in proceeding from\r\none stratum to another. Had M. Schreiber found any pieces of the vein\r\ncontained in the calcareous rock, he would have had good reason for\r\nthat assertion; but, to conclude that fact from grounds which do not\r\nnecessarily imply it, is not to be permitted in sound reasoning, if\r\ncertainty is the object, and not mere probability.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.--The Theory confirmed from Observations made on purpose to\r\nelucidate the subject.\r\n\r\nHaving got a distinct view of the primary and secondary mineral bodies\r\nor strata of the globe, and having thus acquired a particular object to\r\ninquire after, with a view to investigate or illustrate this piece of\r\nnatural history, I was considering where we might most probably succeed\r\nin finding the junction of the low country strata and alpine schistus.\r\nI inquired of Mr Hall of Whitehall, who had frequent opportunities of\r\ntraversing those mountains which lie between his house in the Merse and\r\nEdinburgh; and I particularly entreated him to examine the bed of the\r\nWhittater, which he executed to my satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMr Hall having had occasion to examine the Pease and Tour burns, in\r\nplanning and superintending the great improvement of the post road upon\r\nSir James Hall's estate while Sir James was abroad, he informed me that\r\nthe junction of the schistus and sand-stone strata was to be found in\r\nthe Tour burn. Professor Playfair and I had been intending a visit to\r\nSir James Hall at Dunglass; and this was a motive, not so much to hasten\r\nour visit, as to chose the most proper time for a mineral expedition\r\nboth upon the hills and along the sea shore.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the spring 1788 when Sir James left town, and Mr Playfair\r\nand I went to Dunglass about the beginning of June. We had exceeding\r\nfavourable weather during the most part of our expedition; and I now\r\npropose to give an account of the result of our observations.\r\n\r\nDunglass burn is the boundary between the counties of East Lothian and\r\nBerwickshire; and it is almost the boundary between the vertical and\r\nhorizontal strata. To the north-west of this burn and beautiful dean are\r\nsituated the coal, lime-stone, marl, and sand-stone strata; they are\r\nfound stretching away along the shore in a very horizontal direction\r\nfor some time, but become more and more inclined as they approach the\r\nschistus of which the hills of Lammermuir to the south are composed.\r\n\r\nThough the boundary between the two things here in question be easily\r\nperceivable from the nature of the country at the first inspection, by\r\nthe rising of the hills, yet this does not lead one precisely to the\r\njunction; and in the extensive common boundary of those two things, the\r\njunction itself is only to be perceived in few places, where the rock is\r\nwashed bare by the rivers or the sea, and where this junction is exposed\r\nnaked to our view. The sea is here wearing away the coast; and the bank,\r\nabout 200 feet high, is gradually falling down, making in some places a\r\nsteep declivity, in others a perpendicular cliff. St Abb's Head and Fast\r\nCastle are head lands projecting into the sea, and are the bulwarks of\r\nthis shore, which is embayed to the westward, where the sea preys upon\r\nthe horizontal strata. The solid strata are every where exposed either\r\nin the cliff or on the shore; we were therefore certain of meeting with\r\nthe junction in going from Dunglass to Fast Castle, which is upon the\r\nschistus. But this journey can only be made by sea; and we first set out\r\nto examine the junction in the Tour and Pease burns, where we had been\r\ninformed it was to be found.\r\n\r\nIn the bottom of those rivulets the sand-stone and marly strata appear\r\npretty much inclined, rising towards the schistus country. The two burns\r\nunite before they come to the shore; and it is about midway between this\r\njunction and the bridges which are thrown over those two hollows, that\r\nthe junction is to be found.\r\n\r\nThe schistus strata here approach towards vertical; and the sand-stone\r\nstrata are greatly inclined. But this inclination of those two different\r\nstrata are in opposite directions; neither does the horizontal section\r\nof those two different strata run parallel to the junction; that is to\r\nsay, the intersection of those two different strata is a line inclined\r\nto the horizon.\r\n\r\nAt Jedburgh the schistus was vertical, and the strata horizontal; and\r\nthere was interposed a compound bed of pudding-stone, formed of various\r\nwater-worn bodies, the gravel of the schistus strata, and porphyries.\r\nHere again, though we have not a regular pudding-stone, we have\r\nthat which corresponds to it, as having been the effect of similar\r\ncircumstances. These are the fracture and detritus of the schistus,\r\nwhile the strata were deposited upon the broken ends of the schistus at\r\nthe bottom of the sea. Most of the fragments of the schistus have their\r\nangles sharp; consequently, they had not travelled far, or been much\r\nworn by attrition. But more or less does not alter the nature of an\r\noperation; and the pudding-stone, which at Jedburgh is interposed\r\nbetween the vertical schistus and horizontal strata, is here properly\r\nrepresented by the included fragments of schistus in the inclined\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nThe line of this junction running, on the one hand, towards Fast Castle\r\neastward, and, on the other, towards the head of Dunglass burn\r\nwestward, our business was to pursue this object in those two different\r\ndirections. But it was chiefly in the sea coast that was placed our\r\nexpectations, having recollection of the great banks of gravel under\r\nwhich the strata are buried about Oldhamstocks, near which, from all\r\nappearances, the junction was to be expected.\r\n\r\nHaving taken boat at Dunglass burn, we set out to explore the coast;\r\nand, we observed the horizontal sand-stone turn up near the Pease burn,\r\nlifting towards the schistus. We found the junction of that schistus\r\nwith the red sand-stone and marly strata on the shore and sea bank, at\r\nSt. Helens, corresponding in general with what we had observed in the\r\nburns to the westward. But, at Siccar Point, we found a beautiful\r\npicture of this junction washed bare by the sea. The sand-stone strata\r\nare partly washed away, and partly remaining upon the ends of the\r\nvertical schistus; and, in many places, points of the schistus strata\r\nare seen standing up through among the sand-stone, the greatest part of\r\nwhich is worn away. Behind this again we have a natural section of those\r\nsand-stone strata, containing fragments of the schistus.\r\n\r\nAfter this nothing appears but the schistus rocks, until sand-stone and\r\nmarl again are found at Red-heugh above the vertical strata. From that\r\nbay to Fast Castle we had nothing to observe but the schistus, which is\r\ncontinued without interruption to St Abb's Head. Beyond this, indeed,\r\nthere appears to be something above the schistus; and great blocks of a\r\nred whin-stone or basaltes come down from the height and lie upon the\r\nshore; but we could not perceive distinctly how the upper mass is\r\nconnected with the vertical schistus which is continued below.\r\n\r\nOur attention was now directed to what we could observe with respect\r\nto the schisti, of which we had most beautiful views and most perfect\r\nsections. Here are two objects to be held in view, in making those\r\nobservations; the original formation or stratification of the schisti,\r\nand the posterior operations by which the present state of things has\r\nbeen procured. We had remarkable examples for the illustration of both\r\nthose subjects.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first, we have every where among the rocks many\r\nsurfaces of the erected strata laid bare, in being separated. Here we\r\nfound the most distinct marks of strata of sand modified by moving\r\nwater. It is no other than that which we every day observe upon the\r\nsands of our own shore, when the sea has ebbed and left them in a waved\r\nfigure, which cannot be mistaken. Such figures as these are extremely\r\ncommon in our sand-stone strata; but this is an object which I never had\r\ndistinctly observed in the alpine schisti; although, considering that\r\nthe original of those schisti was strata of sand, and formed in water,\r\nthere was no reason to doubt of such a thing being found. But here the\r\nexamples are so many and so distinct, that it could not fail to give us\r\ngreat satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWe were no less gratified in our views with respect to the other object,\r\nthe mineral operations by which soft strata, regularly formed in\r\nhorizontal planes at the bottom of the sea, had been hardened and\r\ndisplaced. Fig. 4. represents one of those examples; it was drawn by Sir\r\nJames Hall from a perfect section in the perpendicular cliff at Lumesden\r\nburn. Here is not only a fine example of the bendings of the strata, but\r\nalso of a horizontal shift or hitch of those erected strata.\r\n\r\nSt Abb's Head is a promontory which, at a distance, one would naturally\r\nconclude to be composed of the schisti, as is all the shore to that\r\nplace; but, as we approached it, there was some difference to be\r\nperceived in the external appearance, it having a more rounded and\r\nirregular aspect. Accordingly, upon our arrival, we found this head-land\r\ncomposed of a different substance. It is a great mass of red whin-stone,\r\nof a very irregular structure and composition. Some of it is full of\r\nsmall pebbles of calcareous spar, surrounded with a coat of a coloured\r\nsubstance, different both from the whin-stone ground and the inclosed\r\npebble. Here ended our expedition by water.\r\n\r\nHaving thus found the junction of the sand-stone with the schistus\r\nor alpine strata to run in a line directed from Fast Castle to\r\nOldhamstocks, or the heads of Dunglass burn, we set out to trace this\r\nburn, not only with a view to observe the junction, if it should there\r\nappear, but particularly to discover the source of many blocks of\r\nwhin-stone, of all sizes, with which the bed of this burn abounds.\r\n\r\nThe sand-stone and coal strata, which are nearly horizontal at the mouth\r\nof this burn, or on the coast, become inclined as we go up the course of\r\nthe rivulet; and of this we have fine sections in the bank. The Dean of\r\nDunglass is formed of precipitous and perpendicular rocks, through which\r\nthe running water has worn its way more than a hundred feet deep; above\r\nthis Dean the banks are steep and very high, but covered with\r\nsoil, which here is a deep gravel. The burn runs all the way up to\r\nOldhamstocks upon the sand-stone strata; but there, these are traversed\r\nby a high whin-stone dyke, which crosses the burn obliquely, as we found\r\nit on both banks though not in the bed of the burn; it is in the south\r\nbank below the village, and on the north above it. Here is the source\r\nof the whin-stone which we were looking for; it is the common blue\r\nbasaltes, of the same nature with the Giant's Causeway, but with no\r\nregular columner appearance.\r\n\r\nAbove Oldhamstocks we again found the sand-stone in the bank, but it\r\nsoon disappeared under a deep cover of gravel, and the burn then divided\r\ninto several rivulets which come from the hills. We traced the one which\r\nled most directly up to the mountains, in expectation of meeting with\r\nthe schistus, at least, if not the junction of it with the sandstone.\r\nBut in this we were disappointed. We did not however lose our labour;\r\nfor, though the junction which we pursued be not here visible, we met\r\nwith what made it sufficiently evident, and was at the same time an\r\nobject far more interesting in our eyes.\r\n\r\nI have already quoted Mr Voigt's description of the _sol mort rouge_; he\r\nsays, that in places it forms entire mountains; here we have a perfect\r\nexample of the same thing; and the moment we saw it, we said, here is\r\nthe _sol mort rouge_. We ascended to the top of the mountain through\r\na gully of solid pudding-stone going into decay, and furnishing the\r\ncountry below with that great covering of gravel, soil, and water worn\r\nstones. We were now well acquainted with the pudding-stone, which is\r\ninterposed between the horizontal and alpine strata; but from what we\r\nhad seen to the eastward, we never should have dreamed of meeting with\r\nwhat we now perceived. What we had hitherto seen of this pudding-stone\r\nwas but a few fragments of the schistus in the lower beds of sand-stone;\r\nhere a mountain of water-worn schisti, imbedded in a red earth and\r\nconsolidated, presented itself to our view. It was evident that the\r\nschisti mountains, from whence those fragments had come, had been prior\r\nto this secondary mass; but here is a secondary mountain equal in height\r\nto the primary, or schisti mountains, at the basis of which we had seen\r\nthe strata superinduced on the shore. Still, however, every thing here\r\nis formed upon the same principle, and nothing here is altered except\r\nthe scale on which the operation had been performed.\r\n\r\nUpon the coast, we have but a specimen of the pudding-stone; most of\r\nthe fragments had their angles entire; and few of them are rounded by\r\nattrition. Here, on the contrary, the mountain is one pudding-stone;\r\nand most of the fragments are stones much rounded by attrition. But the\r\ndifference is only in degree, and not in kind; the stones are the same,\r\nand the nature of the composition similar. Had we seen the mass of which\r\nthis mountain is only a relict, (having been degraded by the hands of\r\ntime), we should have found this pudding-stone at the bottom of\r\nour sand-stone strata; could we have penetrated below this mass of\r\npudding-stone, we should have found our schistus which we left on the\r\nshore at St. Helens and in the Tour burn. In Tiviotdale the vertical\r\nschisti are covered with a bed of pudding-stone, the gravel of which had\r\nbeen much worn by attrition, but the thickness of that bed is small;\r\nhere again the wearing operation has been great, and the quantity of\r\nthose materials even more than in proportion to those operations. We\r\nreturned perfectly satisfied; and Sir James Hall is to pursue this\r\nsubject farther when he shall be in those mountains shooting muir game.\r\n\r\nWe had now only one object more to pursue; this was to examine the south\r\nside of those mountains of Lammermuir upon the sea shore, in order\r\nto see the junction of the primary schistus with the coal strata\r\nof Berwickshire. Mr Hall was to meet us at the Press, and we were\r\nafterwards to go with him to Whitehall. We met accordingly; but the\r\nweather was rainy; and we went directly to Whitehall. I had often seen\r\nthe pudding-stone in great masse; in the banks of the Whiteader, as\r\nit comes out of the mountains, but then I had not seen its connection\r\nneither, on the one hand, with the schisti, nor, on the other, with the\r\nsand-stone strata. We knew that at Lammerton upon the sea coast there\r\nwas coal, and consequently the sand-stone strata; and reasoning upon\r\nthose data we were sure that our proper course of investigation was to\r\ntrace the river Ey to the shore, and then go south the coast in search\r\nof the junction of the schistus with the horizontal strata. This we\r\nexecuted as well as the weather would permit; but had it to regret,\r\nthat the rainy season was not so favourable for our views, as it was\r\nagreeable to the country which had been suffering with the drought.\r\n\r\nIt is needless now to enlarge upon this subject. I shall only mention\r\nthat we found the red marly strata above the pudding-stone in the bed of\r\nthe Ey and its branches; we then traced the schistus down the Ey, and\r\nfound a mass of the most consolidated pudding-stone upon the coast to\r\nthe north of the harbour of Eymouth. But this mass did not rest on the\r\nschistus; it is immediately upon a mass of whin-stone; and the schistus\r\nis in the harbour, so that this whin-stone mass seems to be here\r\ninterposed between the pudding-stone and schistus. We then pursued\r\nthe coast southwards until we found the junction of the schistus and\r\nsand-stone strata about two miles from Eymouth; but here the junction\r\nwas not attended with any pudding-stone that we could perceive.\r\n\r\nHaving found the same or similar appearances from the one end to the\r\nother, and on both sides of that range of mountains which run from sea\r\nto sea in the south of Scotland, we may now extend our view of this\r\nmineral operation in comprehending every thing of the same kind which we\r\nmeet with in our island or any other distant country.\r\n\r\nThus perhaps the pudding-stone of the south of England will be\r\nconsidered in the same light as having been formed of the _débri_ and\r\n_détritus_ of the flinty bodies.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Arran, there is also a pudding-stone, even in some\r\nof the summits of the island, exactly upon the border of the schistus\r\ndistrict, as will be described in the natural history of that island.\r\nThis pudding-stone is composed of gravel formed of the hardest parts\r\nof the schistus and granite or porphyry mountains. That compound\r\nparasitical stone has been also again cemented by heat and fusion; I\r\nhave a specimen in which there is a clear demonstration of that fact.\r\nOne of the water-worn stones which had been rounded by attrition, has in\r\nthis pudding-stone been broken and shifted, the one half slipping over\r\nthe other, three quarters of an inch, besides other smaller slips in\r\nthe same stone. But the two pieces are again cemented; or they had been\r\nshifted when the stone was in that soft state, by which the two pieces\r\nare made perfectly to cohere. Those shifts and veins, in this species of\r\nstone, are extremely instructive, illustrating the mineral operations of\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nIn like manner to the north of the Grampians, along the south side of\r\nLoch Ness, there are mountains formed of the debris of schistus and\r\ngranite mountains, first manufactured into sand and gravel, and then\r\nconsolidated into a pudding-stone, which is always formed upon the same\r\nprinciple. The same is also found upon the south side of those mountains\r\nin the shire of Angus.\r\n\r\nI may also give for example the African _Brechia_, which is a\r\npudding-stone of the same nature. This stone is composed of granites or\r\nporphyries, serpentines and schisti, extremely indurated and perfectly\r\nconsolidated. It is also demonstrable from the appearance in this stone\r\nthat it has been in a softened state, from the shape and application\r\nof its constituent parts; and in a specimen of it which I have in my\r\ncabinet, there is also a demonstration of calcareous spar flowing among\r\nthe gravel of the consolidated rock.\r\n\r\nThis fact therefore of pudding-stone mountains, is a general fact, so\r\nfar as it is founded upon observations that are made in Africa, Germany,\r\nand Britain. We may now reason upon this general fact, in order to see\r\nhow far it countenances the idea of primitive mountains, on the one\r\nhand, or on the other supports the present theory, which admits of\r\nnothing primitive in the visible or examinable parts of the earth.\r\n\r\nTo a person who examines accurately the composition of our mountains,\r\nwhich occupy the south of Scotland, no argument needs be used to\r\npersuade him that the bodies in question are not primitive; the thing\r\nis evident from inspection, as much as would be the ruins of an ancient\r\ncity, although there were no record of its history. The visible\r\nmaterials, which compose for the most part the strata of our south\r\nalpine schisti, are so distinctly the _debris_ and _detritus_ of a\r\nformer earth, and so similar in their nature with those which for the\r\nmost part compose the strata on all hands acknowledged as secondary,\r\nthat there can remain no question upon that head. The consolidation,\r\nagain, of those strata, and the erection of them from their original\r\nposition, and from the place in which they had been formed, is another\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nBut the acknowledging strata, which had been formed in the sea of loose\r\nmaterials, to be consolidated and raised into the place of land, is\r\nplainly giving up the idea of primitive mountains. The only question,\r\ntherefore, which remains to be solved, must respect the order of things,\r\nin comparing the alpine schisti with the secondary strata; and this\r\nindeed forms a curious subject of investigation.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the schisti had been indurated, elevated, broken, and\r\nworn by attrition in water, before the secondary strata, which form the\r\nmost fertile parts of our earth, had existed. It is also certain that\r\nthe tops of our schistus mountains had been in the bottom of the sea\r\nat the time when our secondary strata had begun to be formed; for the\r\npudding-stone on the top of our Lammermuir mountains, as well as the\r\nsecondary strata upon the vertical schisti of the Alps and German\r\nmountains, affords the most irrefragable evidence of that fact.\r\n\r\nIt is further to be affirmed, that this whole mass of water-formed\r\nmaterials, as well as the basis on which it rested, had been subjected\r\nto the mineral operations of the globe, operations by which the loose\r\nand incoherent materials are consolidated, and that which was the bottom\r\nof the sea made to occupy the station of land, and serve the purpose for\r\nwhich it is destined in the world. This also will appear evident, when\r\nit is considered that it has been from the appearances in this very\r\nland, independent of those of the alpine schisti, that the present\r\ntheory has been established.\r\n\r\nBy thus admitting a primary and secondary in the formation of our land,\r\nthe present theory will be confirmed in all its parts. For, nothing but\r\nthose vicissitudes, in which the old is worn and destroyed, and new\r\nland formed to supply its place, can explain that order which is to be\r\nperceived in all the works of nature; or give us any satisfactory\r\nidea with regard to that apparent disorder and confusion, which would\r\ndisgrace an agent possessed of wisdom and working with design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nOpinions examined with regard to Petrifaction, or Mineral Concretion.\r\n\r\nThe ideas of naturalists with regard to petrifaction are so vague and\r\nindistinct, that no proper answer can be given to them. They in general\r\nsuppose water to be the solvent of bodies, and the vehicle of petrifying\r\nsubstances; but they neither say whether water be an universal\r\nmenstruum, nor do they show in what manner a solid body has been formed\r\nin the bowels of the earth, from that solution. It may now be proper to\r\nexamine this subject, not with a view to explain all those petrifactions\r\nof bodies which is performed in the mineral regions of the earth, those\r\nregions that are inaccessible to man, but to show that what has been\r\nwrote by naturalists, upon this subject, has only a tendency to corrupt\r\nscience, by admitting the grossest supposition in place of just\r\nprinciple or truth, and to darken natural history by introducing an ill\r\nconceived theory in place of matter of fact.\r\n\r\nM. le Comte de Buffon has attempted to explain the crystallization\r\nof bodies, or production of mineral forms, by the accretion or\r\njuxtaposition of elementary bodies, which have only form in two\r\ndimensions, length and breadth; that is to say, that mineral concretions\r\nare composed of surfaces alone, and not of bodies. This however is only\r\nan attempt to explain, what we do not understand, by a proposition which\r\nis either evidently contradictory, or plainly inconceivable. It is\r\ntrue that this eloquent and ingenious author endeavours to correct the\r\npalpable absurdity of the proposition, by representing the constituent\r\nparts of the mineral bodies as \"_de lames infiniment minces_;\" but who\r\nis it does not see, that these infinitely thin plates are no other than\r\nbodies of three dimensions, contrary to the supposition; for, infinitely\r\nthin, means a certain thickness; but the smallest possible or assignable\r\nthickness differs as much from a perfect superficies as the greatest.\r\n\r\nM. de Luc has given us his ideas of petrifaction with sufficient\r\nprecision of term and clearness of expression; his opinion, therefore,\r\ndeserves to be examined; and, as his theory of petrifaction is equally\r\napplicable to every species of substance, it is necessary again to\r\nexamine this subject, notwithstanding of what has been already said,\r\nin the first part of this work, concerning consolidation and mineral\r\nconcretion from the fluid state of fusion.\r\n\r\nThis author has perhaps properly exposed Woodward's Theory of\r\nPetrification in saying[33], \"Son erreur à cet égard vient de ce qu'il\r\nn'a point réfléchi sur la manière dont se fait la _pétrifaction_. Il\r\nramollit d'abord les _pierres_ pour y faire entrer les coquilles, sans\r\nbien connoître l'agent qu'il y employe; et il les duroit ensuite, sans\r\nréfléchir au comment.\" To avoid this error or defect, M. de Luc, in his\r\nTheory of Petrifaction, sets out with the acknowledged principle of\r\ncohesion; and, in order to consolidate strata of a porous texture, he\r\nsupposes water carrying minute bodies of all shapes and sizes, and\r\ndepositing them in such close contact as to produce solidity and\r\nconcretion. Now, if Dr Woodward softened stones without a proper\r\ncause, M. de Luc, in employing the specious principle of cohesion, has\r\nconsolidated them upon no better grounds; for, the application of this\r\nprinciple is as foreign to his purpose, as is that of magnetism. Bodies,\r\nit is true, cohere when their surfaces are closely applied to each\r\nother; But how apply this principle to consolidation?--only by supposing\r\nall the separate bodies, of which the solid is to be composed, to be\r\nin perfect contact in all their surfaces. But this, in other words,\r\nis supposing the body to be solid; and, to suppose the agent, water,\r\ncapable of thus making hard bodies solid, is no other than having\r\nrecourse to the fortuitous concourse of atoms to make a world; a thought\r\nwhich this author would surely hold in great contempt.\r\n\r\n[Note 33: Lettres Physiques et Morales.]\r\n\r\nHe then illustrates this operation of nature by those of art, in\r\nbuilding walls which certainly become hard, and which, as our author\r\nseems to think, become solid. But this is only an imperfect or erroneous\r\nrepresentation of this subject; for, mortar does not become hard upon\r\nthe principle of petrification adopted by our author. Mortar, made of\r\nclay, instead of lime, will not acquire a stony hardness, nor ever, by\r\nmeans of water, will it be more indurated than by simply drying; neither\r\nwill the most subtile powder of chalk, with water and sand, form any\r\nsolid body, or a proper mortar. The induration of mortar arises from the\r\nsolution of a stony substance, and the subsequent concretion of that\r\ndissolved matter, operations purely chemical. Now, if this philosopher,\r\nin his Theory of Petrifaction, means only to explain a chemical\r\noperation upon mechanical principles, why have recourse, for an example\r\nin this subject, to mineral bodies, the origin of which is questioned?\r\nWhy does he not rather explain, upon this principle, the known\r\nconcretion of some body, from a fluid state, or, conversely, the\r\nknown solution of some concreted body? If again he means to explain\r\npetrifaction in the usual way, by a chemical operation, in that case,\r\nthe application of his polished surfaces, so as to cohere, cannot take\r\nplace until the dissolved body be separated from the fluid, by means of\r\nwhich it is transported from place to place in the mineral regions. But\r\nit is in this preliminary step that lies all the difficulty; for, could\r\nwe see how every different substance might be dissolved, and every\r\ndissolved substance separated from its solvent at our pleasure, we\r\nshould find no difficulty in admitting the cohesion of hard bodies,\r\nwhether by means of this doctrine of polished surfaces, or by the\r\nprinciple of general attraction, a principle which surely comprehends\r\nthis particular, termed a cohesive power.\r\n\r\nIt must not be alleged, that seeing we know not how water dissolves\r\nsaline bodies, therefore, this fluid, for any thing that we know, may\r\nalso dissolve crystal; and, if water thus dissolves a mineral substance\r\nin a manner unknown to us, it may in like manner deposit it, although\r\nwe may not be able to imagine how. This kind of reasoning is only\r\ncalculated to keep us in ignorance; at the same time, the reasoning of\r\nphilosophers, concerning petrifaction, does not in general appear to be\r\nfounded on any principle that is more sound. That water dissolves salt\r\nis a fact. That water dissolves crystal is not a fact; therefore, those\r\ntwo propositions, with regard to the power of water, are infinitely\r\nremoved, and cannot be assimilated in sound physical reasoning. It is\r\nno more a truth that water is able to dissolve salt, than that we never\r\nhave been able to detect the smallest disposition in water to dissolve\r\ncrystal, flint, quartz, or metals. Therefore, to allege the possibility\r\nof water being capable of dissolving those bodies in the mineral\r\nregions, and of thus changing the substance of one body into another, as\r\nnaturalists have supposed, contrary to their knowledge, or in order to\r\nexplain appearances, is so far from tending to increase our science,\r\nthat it is abandoning the human intellect to be bewildered in an error;\r\nit is the vain attempt of lulling to sleep the scientific conscience,\r\nand making the soul of man insensible to the natural distress of\r\nconscious ignorance.\r\n\r\nBut besides that negative argument concerning the insolubility of\r\ncrystal, by which the erroneous suppositions of naturalists are to\r\nbe rejected, crystal in general is found regularly concreted in the\r\ncavities of the most solid rock, in the heart of the closest agate, and\r\nin the midst of granite mountains. But these masses of granite were\r\nformed by fusion; I hope that I shall give the most satisfactory proof\r\nof that truth: Consequently, here at least there is no occasion for the\r\naction of water in dissolving siliceous substances in one place, in\r\norder to concrete and crystallise it in another.\r\n\r\nIn these cavities of the solid granite rock, where crystal is found\r\nregularly shooting from a basis which is the internal surface of the\r\ncavity, we find the other constituent substances of the granite also\r\ncrystallised. I have those small cavities, in this rock, from the island\r\nof Arran, containing crystal, felt-spar, and mica, all crystallised in\r\nthe same cavity[34]. But this is nothing to the _druzen_ or crystalline\r\nconcretions, which are found in a similar manner among metallic and\r\nmineral substances in the veins and mines; there, every species of\r\nmineral and metallic substance, with every variety of mixture and\r\ncomposition, are found both concreted and crystallised together in every\r\nimaginable shape and situation.\r\n\r\n[Note 34: The Chevalier Dolomieu makes the following observation.\r\nJournal de Physique, Juillet 1791.\r\n\r\n\"J'ai été étonné de trouver au centre d'un énorme massif de granit, que\r\nl'on avoit ouvert avec la poudre pour pratiquer un chemin, des\r\nmorceaux, gros comme le poing et au dessous, de spath calcaire blanc,\r\ntrès-effervescent, en grandes écailles, ou lames entrecroisées. Il\r\nn'occupoit point des cavités particulières, il n'y paroissoit le\r\nproduit d'une infiltration qui auroit rempli des cavités, mais il étoit\r\nincorporé avec les feld-spath, le mica, et le quartz, faissoit masse\r\navec eux, et ne pouvoit se rompre sans les entraîner avec lui.\"\r\n\r\nThis great naturalist is convinced that the spar had not been here\r\nintroduced by infiltration, although that is the very method which he\r\nemploys to form concretions, not only of spar but of crystal, zeolite,\r\nand pyrites, in the closest cavities of the most solid rocks of\r\nbasaltes. These four substances in this stone were so mixed together\r\nthat nothing but the fusion of the whole mass could explain the state in\r\nwhich they appeared; but, thinking that such a supposition could not\r\nbe allowed, this naturalist, like a man of science when his data fail,\r\nleaves the matter without any interpretation of his own. This however is\r\nwhat he has not done in the case of basaltes, or that which he mistakes\r\nfor proper lavas, as I shall have occasion to show.]\r\n\r\nHere is an infinite operation, but an operation which is easily\r\nperformed by the natural arrangement of substances acting freely in\r\na fluid state, and concreting together, each substance, whether more\r\nsimple or more compound, directing itself by its internal principle of\r\nattraction, and affecting mechanically those that are concreting around\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe see the very same thing happen under our eye, and precisely in the\r\nsame manner. When a fluid mass of any mineral or metallic substance is\r\nmade to congeal by sudden cooling on the outside, while the mass within\r\nis fluid, a cavity is thus sometimes formed by the contraction of the\r\ncontained fluid; and in this cavity are found artificial _druzen_, as\r\nthey may be called, being crystallizations similar to those which the\r\nmineral cavities exhibit in such beauty and perfection.\r\n\r\nPetrification and consolidation, in some degree, may doubtless be\r\nperformed, in certain circumstances, by means of the solution of\r\ncalcareous earth; but the examples given by M. de Luc, of those bodies\r\nof lime-stone and agate petrified in the middle of strata of loose or\r\nsandy materials, are certainly inexplicable upon any other principle\r\nexcept the fusion of those substances with which the bodies are\r\npetrified[35].\r\n\r\n[Note 35: Vid. Lettre 28 et Lettre 103. Lettres Physiques et Morales.]\r\n\r\nThis subject deserves the strictest attention; I propose it as a\r\ntouchstone for every theory of petrification or perfect consolidation.\r\nFirst, There are found, among argillaceous strata, insulated bodies of\r\niron-stone, perfectly consolidated; secondly, There are found, in strata\r\nof chalk and lime-stone, masses of insulated flints; thirdly, There\r\nare found, in strata of sea sand, masses of that sand cemented by a\r\nsiliceous substance; fourthly, In the midst of blocks of sand-stone,\r\nthere are found masses of loose or pure sand inclosed in crystallised\r\ncavities; and in this sand are found insulated masses of crystallised\r\nspar, including within them the sand, but without having the sparry\r\nor calcareous crystallization disturbed by it. There are also other\r\nglobular masses of the same kind, where the sparry crystallization is\r\neither not to be observed, or appears only partially[36]: And now,\r\nlastly, In strata of shell-sand, there are found masses of consolidated\r\nlime-stone or marble. In all those cases, the consolidated bodies are\r\nperfectly insulated in the middle of strata, in which they must of\r\nnecessity have been petrified or consolidated; the stratum around the\r\nbodies has not been affected by the petrifying substance, as there\r\nis not any vestige of it there; and here are examples of different\r\nsubstances, all conspiring to prove one uniform truth. Therefore, a\r\ngeneral theory of petrification or consolidation of mineral bodies must\r\nexplain this distinct fact, and not suffer it any longer to remain a\r\n_lusus naturae_.\r\n\r\n[Note 36: Mem. de l'Académie Royale des Sciences, an. 1775.]\r\n\r\nLet us now consider what it is that we have to explain, upon the\r\nsupposition of those concretions being formed from a solution. We have,\r\nfirst, To understand what sort of a solution had been employed for the\r\nintroducing of those various substances; secondly, How those concretions\r\nhad been formed from such solutions within those bodies of strata; and,\r\nlastly, How such concretions could have been formed, without any vestige\r\nappearing of the same substance, or of the same operation, in the\r\nsurrounding part of the stratum. Whatever may be the difficulty\r\nof explaining those particular appearances by means of fusion and\r\nmechanical force, it is plainly impossible to conceive those bodies\r\nformed in those places by infiltration, or any manner of concretion from\r\na state of solution.\r\n\r\nNaturalists, in explaining the formation of stones, often use a chemical\r\nlanguage which either has no proper meaning, or which will not apply to\r\nthe subject of mineral operations. We know the chemical process by which\r\none or two stony concretions may be formed among bodies passing from\r\none state to another. When, therefore, a change from a former state of\r\nthings in mineral bodies is judged by naturalists to have happened, the\r\npresent state is commonly explained, or the change is supposed to have\r\nbeen made by means of a similar process, without inquiring if this had\r\ntruly been the case or not. Thus their knowledge of chemistry has led\r\nnaturalists to reason erroneously, in explaining things upon false\r\nprinciples. It would be needless to give an example of any one\r\nparticular author in this respect; for, so far as I have seen, it\r\nappears to be almost general, every one copying the language of another,\r\nand no one understanding that language which has been employed.\r\n\r\nThese naturalists suppose every thing done by means of solution in the\r\nmineral kingdom, and yet they are ignorant of those solvents. They\r\nconceive or they imagine concretions and crystallizations to be formed\r\nof every different substance, and in every place within the solid body\r\nof the earth, without considering how far the thing is possible which\r\nthey suppose. They are constantly talking of operations which could only\r\ntake place in the cavities of the earth above the level of the sea, and\r\nwhere the influence of the atmosphere were felt; and yet this is the\r\nvery place which we have it in our power to examine, and where, besides\r\nthe stalactite, and one or two more of the same kind, or formed on the\r\nsame principle, they have never been able to discover one of the many\r\nwhich, according to their theory, ought always to be in action or\r\neffect. So far from knowing that general consolidating operation, which\r\nthey suppose to be exerted in filling up the veins and cavities of the\r\nearth by means of the infiltrating water of the surface, they do not\r\nseem fully to understand the only operation of this kind which they see.\r\nThe concretion of calcareous matter upon the surface of the earth is\r\nperhaps the only example upon which their theory is founded; and\r\nyet nothing can be more against it than the general history of this\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nCalcareous matter, the great _vinculum_ of many mineral bodies, is in\r\na perpetual state of dissolution and decay, in every place where the\r\ninfluences of air and water may pervade. The general tendency of this\r\nis to dissolve calcareous matter out of the earth, and deliver that\r\nsolution into the sea. Were it possible to deny that truth, the\r\nvery formation of stalactite, that operation which has bewildered\r\nnaturalists, would prove it; for it is upon the general solubility of\r\ncalcareous matter exposed to water that those cavities are formed, in\r\nwhich may be found such collections of stalactical concretion; and the\r\ngeneral tendency of those operations is to waste the calcareous bodies\r\nthrough which water percolates. But how is the general petrifaction or\r\nconsolidation of strata, below the surface of the sea, to be explained\r\nby the general dissolution of that consolidating substance in the\r\nearth above that level? Instead of finding a general petrifying or\r\nconsolidating operation in the part of the earth which we are able to\r\nexamine, we find the contrary operation, so far at least as relates to\r\ncalcareous spar, and many other mineral bodies which are decomposed and\r\ndissolved upon the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nThus in the surface of the earth, above the level of the sea, no\r\npetrifying operation of a durable nature is found; and, were such an\r\noperation there found, it could not be general, as affecting every kind\r\nof substance. But, even suppose that such a general operation were found\r\nto take place in the earth above the level of the sea, where there might\r\nbe a circulation of air and percolation of water, How could the strata\r\nof the earth below the level of the sea be petrified? This is a question\r\nthat does not seem to have entered into the heads of our naturalists\r\nwho attempt to explain petrifaction or mineral concretion from aqueous\r\nsolutions. But the consolidation of loose and incoherent things,\r\ngathered together at the bottom of the sea, and afterwards raised\r\ninto rocks of various sorts, forms by far the greatest example of\r\npetrification or mineral operation of this globe. It is this that must\r\nbe explained in a mineral theory; and it is this great process of\r\npetrifaction to which the doctrine of infiltration, whether for the\r\nmechanical purpose of applying cohesive surfaces, or the chemical one of\r\nforming crystallizations and concretions, will not by any means apply.\r\n\r\nNothing shows more how little true science has been employed for the\r\nexplanation of phenomena, than the language of modern naturalists, who\r\nattribute, to stalactical and stalagmical operations, every superficial\r\nor distant resemblance to those calcareous bodies, the origin of which\r\nwe know so well. It is not a mere resemblance that should homologate\r\ndifferent things; there should be a specific character in every thing\r\nthat is to be generalised. It will be our business to show that, in the\r\nfalse stalactites, there is not the distinctive character of those water\r\nformed bodies to be found.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of stalactical concretions, besides the incrustation as\r\nwell as crystallization of the stony substance from the aqueous vehicle\r\nby which it had been carried in the dissolved state, we have the other\r\nnecessary accompanyments of the operation, or collateral circumstances\r\nof the case. Such, for example, is that tubular construction of the\r\nstalactite, first formed by the concretion of the calcareous substance\r\nupon the outside of the pendant gut of water exposed to the evaporation\r\nof the atmosphere; we then see the gradual filling up of that pervious\r\ntube through which the petrifying water had passed for a certain time;\r\nand, lastly, we see the continual accretion which this conducting body\r\nhad received from the water running successively over every part of\r\nit. But among the infinite number of siliceous concretions and\r\ncrystallizations, as well as those of an almost indefinite variety of\r\nother substances, all of which are attributed to solution, there is not\r\nthe least vestige of any collateral operation, by which the nature of\r\nthat concretion might be ascertained in the same manner. In all\r\nthose cases, we see nothing but the concreted substances or their\r\ncrystallizations; but, no mark of any solvent or incrusting process is\r\nto be perceived. On the contrary, almost all, or the greatest part\r\nof them, are so situated, and attended with such circumstances, as\r\ndemonstrate the physical impossibility of that being the manner in which\r\nthey had been concreted; for, they are situated within close cavities,\r\nthrough which nothing can pervade but heat, electricity, magnetism,\r\netc.; and they fill those cavities more or less, from the thinnest\r\nincrustation of crystals to the full content of those cavities with\r\nvarious substances, all regularly concreted or crystallised according to\r\nan order which cannot apply to the concretion of any manner of solution.\r\n\r\nThat there is, in the mineral system, an operation of water which may\r\nwith great propriety be termed _infiltration_, I make no doubt. But this\r\noperation of water, that may be employed in consolidating the strata\r\nin the mineral regions, is essentially different from that which is\r\ninconsiderately employed or supposed by mineralists when they talk\r\nof infiltration; these two operations have nothing in common except\r\nemploying the water of the surface of the earth to percolate a porous\r\nbody. Now, the percolation of water may increase the porousness of that\r\nbody which it pervades, but never can thus change it from a porous to a\r\nperfect solid body. But even the percolation of water through the strata\r\ndeposited at the bottom of the sea, necessarily required, according to\r\nthe supposition of naturalists, must be refused; for, the interstices of\r\nthose strata are, from the supposition of the case, already filled with\r\nwater; consequently, without first removing that stagnant water, it is\r\nin vain to propose the infiltration of any fluid from the surface.\r\n\r\nThis is a difficulty which does not occur in our theory, where the\r\nstrata, deposited at the bottom of the sea, are to be afterwards heated\r\nby the internal fires of the earth. The natural consequence of those\r\nheating operations may be considered as the converting of the water\r\ncontained in the strata into steam, and the expulsion of steam or\r\nvapour, by raising it up against the power of gravity, to be delivered\r\nupon the surface of the earth and again condensed to the state of water.\r\n\r\nLet us now conceive the strata, which had been deposited at the bottom\r\nof the sea, as exhausted of their water, and as communicating with the\r\nsurface of the earth impregnated with water. Here again we have the\r\npower of gravity to operate in carrying down water to that place which\r\nhad been before exhausted by the power of heat; and in this manner, by\r\nalternately employing those two great physical agents, we cannot doubt\r\nthat nature may convey soluble substances from above, and deposit them\r\nbelow for the purpose of consolidating porous bodies, or of filling with\r\nsaline and earthy matter those interstices which had been originally\r\nfilled with water, when the strata were deposited at the bottom of the\r\nsea. How far any marks of this operation may be perceived, by carefully\r\nexamining our mines and minerals, I know not; I can only say that, on\r\nthe contrary, whenever those examined objects were clear and distinct,\r\nwith the concomitant circumstances, so as to be understood, I have\r\nalways found the most certain marks of the solid bodies having concreted\r\nfrom the fluid state of fusion. This, however, does not exclude the case\r\nof infiltration having been previously employed; and I would intreat\r\nmineralists, who have the opportunity of examining the solid parts of\r\nthe earth, to attend particularly to this distinction. But do not let\r\nthem suppose that infiltration can be made to fill either the pores or\r\nveins of strata without the operation of mineral heat, or some such\r\nprocess by which the aqueous vehicle may be discharged.\r\n\r\nNot only are mineral philosophers so inconsiderate, in forming\r\ngeological theories upon a mere supposition or false analogy, they\r\nhave even proceeded, upon that erroneous theory, to form a geological\r\nsupposition for explaining the appearances of strata and other stony\r\nmasses in employing a particular physical operation, which is, that\r\nof _crystallization_[37]. Now crystallization may be considered as a\r\nspecies of elective concretion, by which every particular substance, in\r\npassing from a fluid to a solid state, may assume a certain peculiar\r\nexternal shape and internal arrangement of its parts, by which it is\r\noften distinguished. But, to suppose the solid mineral structure of the\r\nearth explained, like an enigma, by the word _crystallization_, is to\r\nmisunderstand the science by which we would explain the subject of\r\nresearch; and, to form a general mineral theory thus upon that term,\r\nis an attempt to generalise without a reason. For, when it were even\r\nadmitted that every solid body is crystallised, we thus know no more of\r\nthe geology of this earth, or understand as little of the general theory\r\nof mineral concretion, as we did before;--we cannot, from that, say\r\nwhether it be by the operation of solution or of fusion which had\r\nproduced the perceived effect.\r\n\r\n[Note 37: Journal de Physique; Avril 1753.]\r\n\r\nM. de Carosi has wrote a treatise upon certain petrifactions[38]. In the\r\ndoctrine of this treatise there is something new or extraordinary. It\r\nwill therefore be proper to make some observations on it.\r\n\r\n[Note 38: Sur la Génération du Silex et du Quartz en partie.\r\nObservations faites en Pologne 1783, à Cracovie.]\r\n\r\nThe object of this treatise is to describe the generation of silex and\r\nquartz, with their modifications or compositions, formed within mineral\r\nbodies of a different substance. The natural history contained in this\r\nlittle treatise is well described and sufficiently interesting. But It\r\nis chiefly in order to examine the means which, according to the theory\r\nof this treatise, are employed in petrifying bodies, that I consider it\r\nin this place.\r\n\r\nThe first section of this treatise has for title, _Génération du Caillou\r\net du Quartz de la terre calcaire pure_. It may be worth while to\r\ncompare the natural history of this part of the earth with the flint and\r\nchert found in our chalk and lime-stone countries. I shall therefore\r\ntranscribe what is worth observing upon that subject (p. 5.).\r\n\r\n\"Nous rencontrons chez nous dans les parties le plus montagneuses, et\r\nles moins couvertes de terreau, ou tout-au plus de sable, entre de purs\r\nrochers calcaires une quantité incroyable de cailloux (silex) tant en\r\nboules, que veines, couches, et débris. Au premier coup d'oeil l'on\r\ns'imagine que ce font des débris de montagnes éloignées, qui y furent\r\namenés par les eaux, mais, en examinant la chose de plus pres, on est\r\nconvaincu, que ce sont tout au contraire, des parties détachées des\r\nmontagnes de la contrée. Car il y a sur presque toute l'étendue de nos\r\nmontagnes calcaires une couche, ou pour mieux dire, un banc composé\r\nde plusieurs couches de base calcaire, mais qui ou sont parsemées\r\nirrégulièrement de boules, de rognons, de veines, et de petits filons\r\nde silex, ou qui contiennent cette pierre en filon, veines, et couches\r\nparallèles, et régulièrement disposées. Les boules et rognons de silex\r\ny font depuis moins de la grandeur d'une petite noisette, jusqu'au\r\ndiamètre de plus de six pouces de nôtre mesure. La plupart de ces boules\r\ntant qu'elles sont dans l'intérieur caché de la roche vive, et qu'elles\r\nn'ont rien souffert de l'impression de l'air, ont, pour l'ordinaire, une\r\ncroûte de spath calcaire, au moyen de la quelle elles sont accrues à\r\nla roche mere; ou pour mieux dire la croûte spatheuse fait l'intermède\r\nentre le silex, et la roche calcaire, par où se fait le passage de l'une\r\nà l'autre. Mais ceci ne vaut que de boules de silex entièrement formées.\r\nC'est dont on peut même se convaincre à la vue, par beaucoup de pierres\r\ndont le pavé de la ville de Cracovie est composé. Mais là, ou le silex\r\nn'est pas encore entièrement achevé, la croûte spatheuse manque, en\r\nrevanche on y voit évidemment le passage par degrés successifs de la\r\nroche calcaire au silex qui y est contenu, et les nuances de ce passage\r\nsont souvent si peu marquées que même les acides minéraux ne suffisent\r\npas à les déterminer, ce n'est que le briquet, qui nous aide à les\r\ndécouvrir. On voit bien ou la pierre calcaire s'enfonce en couleur, l'on\r\ns'apperçoit, où sa dureté, ses cassures changent, mais, comme elle y\r\nsouffre encore quelque impression des acides, l'on ne sauroit déterminer\r\nau juste le point, ou elle a déjà plus de la nature du silex, que de\r\ncelle de la chaux, qu'en la frappant du briquet.\r\n\r\n\"Tels sont les cailloux en boules et rognons avant leur état de\r\nperfection, il y aura même au milieu une partie de pierre calcaire non\r\nchangée.\r\n\r\n\"Ceux au contraire, ou la nature à achevé son ouvrage, ont une croûte de\r\nchaux endurcie, et sont purement du silex fini, mais de toutes couleurs,\r\nd'un grain et d'une texture plus ou moins fine, qui passe assez souvent\r\npar degrés dans les différentes variétés du noble silex. Ils ont, pour\r\nl'ordinaire, dans leur intérieur une cavité, mais pas toujours au\r\ncentre, et qui vient apparemment de la consommation de cette partie\r\ncalcaire qui y resta la dernière, et n'en fut changée ou dissolute et\r\nséparée, que lorsque le reste du silex étoit déjà entièrement fini. Ces\r\ncavités sont toujours, ou enduites de calcédoine en couche concentriques\r\nrecouverte de petits cristaux fort brillans et durs de quartz, ou bien\r\nseulement de ces derniers-ci. Par-fois il y a aussi du spath calcaire\r\ncrystallisé, mais cela est extrêmement rare. Quelque-fois enfin ces\r\ncavités sont remplies d'une noix de calcédoine. Je n'ai réussi qu'une\r\nseule fois en cassant un pareil silex en boule d'y trouver encore le\r\nreste de l'eau de crystallisation.\"\r\n\r\nThe only remark that I would here make is this, that, if the\r\ncrystallization of those close cavities in the _silex_ had at any time\r\nrequired water of solution, it must always have required it. But, if\r\nthere had been water of solution contained in those close cavities, for\r\nthe crystallization of the various things which are often found within\r\nthem, How comes it that this water is almost never found? I have good\r\nreason to believe that water contained within a solid flint will not\r\nmake its escape, as does that contained in the _anhydrites_ of Mount\r\n_Berico_, which are composed of a porous calcedony. But the siliceous\r\ncrystallizations within close cavities is a curious subject, which we\r\nshall have occasion to examine more particularly in treating of agates.\r\nWe now proceed to the next section, which is the generation of silex and\r\nquartz in marl, (p. 19.)\r\n\r\n\"Il y a des contrées, chez nous, qui out des étendus assez considérables\r\nen long et en large, de montagnes de pierre de marne calcaire, dans\r\nlesquelles on rencontre le même phénomène que dans celles de chaux pure;\r\nc. a. d. nous y trouvons du silex de différentes variétés, et dans tous\r\nles degrés successifs de leur formation, et de leur perfection. Outre\r\ncela, nous y voyons encore quelque chose, qui semble nous conduire à\r\nla découverte des moyens, dont se sort la nature pour effecteur cette\r\nopération, et qui nous étoit caché dans les montagnes de chaux pure: ces\r\nbancs de pierre marnesilicieuse, contiennent une partie considérable de\r\npyrites sulfureuses, qui non seulement y forment une grande quantité\r\nde petits sillons, mais toute la masse de la montagne est rempli de\r\nparcelles souvent presqu'imperceptibles de ce minéral. Ces pyrites sont\r\névidemment des productions du phlogistique et de l'acide contenu dans la\r\nmontagne.\r\n\r\n\"L'eau, qui s'y trouve ordinairement en assez grande abondance, en\r\ndétacha, extraha d'un et l'autre, et les combina après tous les deux\r\nensemble. Cette même eau les dissout derechef, et en fait de nouvelles\r\ncombinaisons. C'est ce qu'on voit évidemment là, ou la nature, ayant\r\ncommencé ses opérations, il n'y est resté de la pyrite, qu'une portion\r\nde la partie inflammable liée à une base terrestre. Dans ces endroits\r\nla marne n'est que fort peu sensible aux acides, et de blanche qu'elle\r\nétoit, sa couleur est devenue presque noire. C'est là qu'on observe les\r\ndifférens degrés du changement de la marne en silex, contenant, même\r\nencore, par fois, de parties pyritéiques non détruites dans son\r\nintérieur. Et comme la nature forme ici, de même, que dans la chaux pure\r\nles silex, la plupart en boules ou rognons; comme les différent degrés\r\nde métamorphoses de la marne en silex, sont ici beaucoup plus nombreuses\r\nque là, de sorte qu'il y a des bandes entières, qui mériteroient plutôt\r\nd'être appellés bandes silicieuses, que marneuses; comme il y a, enfin,\r\nune grande quantité de pyrites, qu'ailleurs, il est très probable\r\nqu'elle se serve là du même moyen qu'ici pour opérer la métamorphose en\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"Ne nous précipitons, cependant, pas à en tirer plus de conséquences;\r\npoursuivons plutôt le fil de notre récit.\r\n\r\n\"Le silex, qui se trouve ici, est non seulement de différents degrés de\r\nperfection, il est de plus d'une espèce. Il y a de la pierre à feu, 2 de\r\nla calcédoine, 3 des agathes, et 4 différentes nuances et passages des\r\nespèces ordinaires aux fines du silex.\r\n\r\n\"La pierre à feu, est, ordinairement dans son état de perfection d'un\r\ngrain assez fin, d'une couleur grise plus ou moins foncée, et même\r\ndonnant, dans le noirâtre, plus ou moins diaphane; ses cassures sont\r\nconcentriques ou coquillées, et sa masse est assez compacte. Outre sa\r\nconformation ordinaire en boules et rognons, elle fait presque toujours\r\nla noix de ursins marins, qui y font en grand nombre, et dont la\r\ncoquille est le plus souvent, et presque toujours de spath calcaire,\r\nmême au milieu d'une boule de silex parfait.\r\n\r\n\"Les calcédoines et agathes de ces couches sont toujours (au moins, je\r\nne les ai pas encore vues autrement) de coraux et autres corps marins\r\npétrifiés. Donc, il faut que les couches de pierres roulées, d'où j'ai\r\ntiré ma collection citée plus haut, soyent des débris de montagne»\r\ndétruites de cette espèce. Il y en a qui sont très parfaites comme\r\ncelles qui composent ma collection, d'autres méritent plutôt d'être\r\nrangées parmi les passages du silex ordinaire, et ses espèces plus\r\nfines; d'autres encore sont, en effet, de vraies agathes, mais qui\r\nrenferment dans leur intérieur plus ou moins de parties non parfaites\r\npresque calcaires, qui s'annoncent d'abord par leur couleur blanche,\r\npar leur gros grains relativement au reste, par leur opacité, par leur\r\nmollesse respective, et souvent même par leur sensibilité pour les\r\nacides minéraux. Mais celles, qui sont finies, quoiqu'elles ayent, pour\r\nla plupart, une couleur presque noire, ne laissent, cependant, pas\r\nd'avoir aussi des teintes plus claires comme brunâtres, verdâtres,\r\nrougeâtres, jaunâtres, bleuâtres, tachetées, veinées, etc. Leur clarté\r\nn'est pas moins variable, que leur couleur, il y en a de presqu'opaques,\r\ncomme aussi de presque transparentes, sur tout là, ou la calcédoine\r\nprédomine.\r\n\r\n\"Le quartz s'y trouve comme dans les pierres de la première section, c,\r\na, d, crystallisé, en groupes dans de petites cavités; quelquefois aussi\r\nen veines. La calcédoine y est de même, ou bien en mamelons, ou bien en\r\nstalactites, lorsqu'elle a de la place pour s'y déposer.\r\n\r\n\"Un phénomène encore plus curieux que cela est cette belle pyrite\r\nsulphureuse jaune, comme de l'or, qui est quelquefois parsemée par tout\r\nla substance de pétrifications agathisées, et qui apparemment y fut\r\ndéposée après la dite métamorphose à la faveur des petits pores, qui y\r\nétoient restés ouverts.\"\r\n\r\nI would beg that mineralists, who use such language as this, would\r\nconsider if it contains a distinct idea of the operation which they\r\nwould thereby describe, or if it does not contain either a contradiction\r\nor an inconceivable proposition. It supposes a calcareous body to be\r\nmetamorphosed, somehow by means of the mountain acid, into a siliceous\r\nbody. But, finding many bodies of pyrites contained within that solid\r\nflint, it is said, that, when the calcareous body was flintified, there\r\nwere left in it cavities which were afterwards filled with pyrites. Let\r\nus reflect a moment upon this doctrine. These cavities were first open\r\nto the outside of the flinty body; but now the pyrites with which they\r\nhad been filled is insulated in the solid flint. Here three things are\r\nrequired; first, The calcareous body is to be flintified, at the same\r\ntime leaving the body full of small cavities open to the outside;\r\nsecondly, These cavities are to be filled with pyrites; lastly, These\r\nmineral bodies are to be so inclosed within the flint, as to leave no\r\nvestige of the former processes. This marly mountain itself, which had\r\nbeen formed of loose materials gathered together at the bottom of the\r\nsea, was first to be filled with pyrites, in various shapes, by means of\r\nthe phlogistic and the acid of the mountain. Here is proposed to us an\r\noperation which is totally unknown, or of which we have no kind of\r\nidea. But, let us suppose pyrites formed in this mountain, (of whatever\r\nchemical substances), by means of water; Why should water again undo\r\nthat pyrites, in order to form other concretions? And, Why should the\r\nflint be formed first with cavities, and then made solid, after pyrites\r\nhad been introduced into those cavities of the agate, and, as our author\r\nexpresses it, _parsemée pour toute la substance?_ Here are suppositions\r\nwhich are not only perfectly gratuitous, but are also inconsistent with\r\nany thing that we understand. This is not explaining nature; it is only\r\nfeigning causes[39].\r\n\r\n[Note 39: The description of those insulated siliceous bodies,\r\ncontaining in their closed cavities all the usual concretions of\r\ncalcedony and crystals, as well as full of small pyrites floating in the\r\nsolid flint, are extremely interesting to a mineral system, or such a\r\ngeological theory as should explain the present state of things in those\r\nstrata that had been formed by deposits of known materials at the bottom\r\nof the sea; they are indeed such appearances as may be found, more or\r\nless, in all consolidated strata. But it is this author's explanation of\r\nthat petrifaction which is our present object to consider; and, as he is\r\nso particular in giving us his theory upon the subject, it is easy to\r\ndetect the error of his reasoning. Were those naturalists who explain\r\nthings only in general, by saying that water is the agent, and\r\ninfiltration the means employed by nature;--were these naturalists, I\r\nsay, to give us as particular a description of their process, it would\r\nappear as inconsistent with the nature of things as that which we have\r\nfrom this author, who examines nature very minutely, and who sees\r\ndistinctly that the infiltrating theory is inapplicable for the\r\nexplanation of those petrifactions.]\r\n\r\nThe third section has for title, \"_Generation du Silex et Quartz de la\r\nPierre Puante_.\" Here we find an example worthy of being recorded,\r\nas contributing to throw great light upon those mineral operations;\r\nhowever, the opinion of our author and mine, upon this subject, differ\r\nwidely. He proceeds thus:\r\n\r\n\"Cette pierre n'est, comme chacun le sçait, qu'une pierre calcaire\r\ncontenant du bitume.\r\n\r\n\"Nos montagnes n'en contiennent seulement pas de simples couches, mais\r\nil y en a même de grandes bancs fort épais.\r\n\r\n\"Le caillou, ou silex qui s'y génère, forme, tantôt de gros blocs\r\ninformes, qui occupent des cavités dans l'intérieure des montagnes,\r\ntantôt, enfin, en forme de filons.\r\n\r\n\"J'ai remarqué cette métamorphose sur trois endroits différens, dans\r\nchacun des quels la nature a autrement opéré.\r\n\r\n\"Sur l'un, la pierre puante fait un banc horizontal dans une montagne de\r\npierre calcaire crystalline, ou d'une espèce de marbre, qui contient\r\ndes couches et filons de métal. Ce banc de pierre puante y fait le toit\r\nd'une couche de galène de plomb et de pierre calaminaire, et dans ses\r\ncavités et fentes il y a non seulement des blocs de grandeur différente,\r\nmais aussi des veines et petites bandes courtes de silex, tant\r\nordinaire, que noble c, a, d, de la pierre à feu, de calcédoine,\r\nd'agathes, et même d'une espèce de cornaline jaune et rouge pâle. Je ne\r\nm'arrêterai pas à en détailler les variétés, parce qu'elles sont trop\r\naccidentelles. Je ne les connois pas même toutes, il s'en faut de\r\nbeaucoup, parce qu'elles se trouvent dans des anciennes mines négligées,\r\npeut être depuis plus d'un siècle, et par conséquent peu accessibles. Je\r\nne doute, cependant pas, que, si l'on pouvoit mieux sonder le terrain,\r\non y trouveroit bien plus encore du peu que j'ai cité. Parmi ce silex,\r\nil y a aussi de petites groupes et de petites veines de quartz solide et\r\ncrystallisé.\r\n\r\n\"Au second endroit la pierre puante fait un filon, ou si l'on veut,\r\nune couche ou bande verticale, qui partage la montagne en deux parties\r\npresqu'égales de l'épaisseur de trois aunes à peu près. La montagne,\r\nou cela se voit est aussi une ancienne mine de cuivre et de plomb,\r\nconsistant en plusieurs variétés de marbre, différent en couleur et en\r\ngrain, déposées par couches les unes sur les autres. Le filon de silex\r\nest formé de feuilles alternatives de pierre puante et de silex, tous\r\nles deux de couleur brun de bois à peu prés; mais le silex est plus\r\nfoncé que sa compagne. Ces feuilles alternatives, consistent d'autres\r\nbien plus minces encore, qui souvent n'ont pas l'épaisseur d'une ligne,\r\nmais ce qu'il y a de plus curieux, c'est que la même feuille est d'un\r\nbut de pierre porque, qui, vers le milieu, passe successivement en\r\nsilex, qui, à son tour, vers l'autre but, qui étoit exposé à l'air\r\nrepasse par les mêmes gradations en une espèce de tuffe calcaire. Ce qui\r\nnous fait voir évidemment la génération et la destruction du silex, même\r\navec une partie des moyens par lesquels elle s'opère. Comme l'endroit de\r\ncette découverte n'est accessible qu'à la superficie, je ne saurois dire\r\ns'il y a d'autres variétés de silex outre la dite. Il l'est à supposer\r\nautant par analogie, que par quelques morceaux qui ont de petites veines\r\ntransversales d'une espèce de calcédoine, et qui sont, même, sur leur\r\nfentes, garnis de petits cristaux de roche. Mais ce qu'il y a de sur\r\nc'est que ce filon, parvenu à une certaine profondeur, s'ennoblit et\r\ncontient du métal, c. a. d. de la galène de plomb, et de la pyrite\r\ncuivreuse, j'y en ai trouvés de morceaux, qui en font de preuves\r\nincontestables. Le caillou d'ici est un grain fin d'une texture forte,\r\npeu transparent, donne beaucoup d'étincelles au briquet, mais ses\r\ncassures sont écailleuses.\r\n\r\n\"La montagne calcaire du troisième lieu a une couche de pierre puante\r\népaisse de plusieurs aunes, qui, derechef contient de petites couches\r\nirrégulières et des bandes transversales de silex, qui ont jusques â\r\nsix pouces passés d'épaisseur. La pierre puante est d'une couleur\r\ngris-brune, d'un grain assez fin, et d'un tissu assez dur; ses cassures\r\nsont irrégulières, mais plus la pierre s'approche du silex, plus elles\r\ndonnent dans le coquillé. Le silex ordinaire est d'un brun de bois, d'un\r\ngrain assez fin, et d'un tissu résistant, et ses cassures sont égales à\r\nla pierre porque. Ce n'est pas là la seule variété, il y a, aussi, de la\r\ncalcédoine et des agathes de couleurs différentes. Même la pierre à\r\nfeu est assez souvent traversée de veines de calcédoine, de quartz\r\ncrystallisé, et de spath calcaire blanc en feuilles et en crystaux. Il\r\narrive que la même veine est composée de ces trois espèces de pierres à\r\nla fois, de sorte que l'une semble passer dans l'autre, parce que les\r\nlimites réciproques sont, souvent, assez indistinctes. Il est évident,\r\nque le silex est formé de la pierre puante, parce qu'on remarque ici\r\nles mêmes phénomènes dont j'ai parlé plus haut, c. a. d. les passages\r\nsuccessifs de l'une dans l'autre pierre, tant en montant qu'en\r\ndescendant.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing particular in the siliceous mixture in this species of\r\nlime-stone, except the vein of that substance. It is evident that this\r\nvein, traversing the mountain, had been introduced in the fluid state\r\nof fusion. I do not mean to say, that, in this particular case now\r\ndescribed, the evidence of that truth peculiarly appears; but that, from\r\nthe general nature of mineral veins breaking and traversing the solid\r\nstrata of the globe, no other conclusion can be formed; and that in\r\nthe particulars of this example there is nothing that could lead us to\r\nsuppose any other origin to the petrifactions contained in this vein\r\nof stinking lime-stone. It is plain, that our author has imagined to\r\nhimself an unknown manner of executing his mineral metamorphoses. He\r\nsees plainly that the common notion of infiltration will not at all\r\nexplain the evident confusion of those calcareous and siliceous bodies\r\nwhich appear to him to be metamorphosing into each other. Nothing,\r\nindeed, can explain those phenomena but a general cause of fluidity; and\r\nthere is no such general cause besides that of heat or fusion.\r\n\r\nBut to show how mineralists of great merit, gentlemen who have examined\r\nsystematically and with some accuracy, may impose upon themselves in\r\nreasoning for the explanation of mineral appearances from limited\r\nnotions of things, and from the supposition of these having been formed\r\nwhere they now are found, that is, upon the surface of the earth, I\r\nwould beg leave to transcribe what this author has said upon this\r\nspecies of petrifaction. It is not that he is ignorant of what\r\nmineralists have already said upon the subject; it is because he sees\r\nthe incompetency of their explanations in those particular cases; and\r\nthat he would employ some other more effectual means. (p. 50.)\r\n\r\n\"Toute terre calcaire à changer dans une autre doit, avant toute chose,\r\nêtre rendue réfractaire ce qui ne peut se faire qu'en la saturant avec\r\nun acide. Mais une terre simplement, saturée d'un acide, est d'une\r\nréduction fort aisée, vu que l'acide n'y tient pas trop fort, d'ailleurs\r\nce n'est qu'un sel neutre terreux fort facile â dissoudre dans une\r\nquantité suffisante d'eau. Or pour rendre cette union plus constante, il\r\nfaut que la terre alcaline s'assimile intimement à l'acide, ce qui ne\r\nse sera jamais sans un intermedeliant, qui homogène les parties de ce\r\nnouveau corps, et pour que cela ce fasse il est indispensable, qu'il\r\ns'opère une dissolution foncière des parties terrestres de la chaux, qui\r\nfacilite l'ingress à l'acide, et à l'intermède pour qu'ils s'y lie bien\r\nfortement. Supposons qu'il se forme une liqueur savonneuse de l'acide et\r\ndu phlogistique, que l'air fixe, mis en liberté, ouvre les interstices\r\ndes parties qui constituent la terre alcaline, qu'apres cela cette\r\nliqueur savonneuse ayant l'entrée libre s'assimile à la terre en\r\nproportion requise, que l'eau, qui servoit de véhicule dans cette\r\noperation, s'évapore successivement, et emporte le superflu des\r\ningrediens, pour qu'il se puisse opérer le rapprochement le plus exacte\r\ndes parcelles ou molécules homogénées de nouveau corps qu'enfin les\r\nmolécules les plus pures et les mieux affinées soyent réunies en forme\r\nliquide dans des cavités, et que par l'évaporation et séparation de\r\nl'eau, ou elles nageoient, il s'en forme des crystaux n'aurons-nous\r\npas une boule de silex, avec de crystaux de quartz dans ses creux\r\nintérieurs.\"\r\n\r\nThe supposed case is this; a calcareous body is to be metamorphosed\r\ninto a siliceous nodule, having a cavity within it lined with quartz,\r\ncrystals, etc. M. de Carosi means to inform us how this may be done.\r\nNow, as this process requires no other conditions than those that may\r\nbe found upon the surface of this earth, the proper way to prove this\r\nhypothetical theory, would be to exhibit such a mineral body produced\r\nby those means. But, even supposing that such a process were to be\r\nexhibited, still it would remain to be explained, how this process,\r\nwhich requires conditions certainly not be found at the bottom of the\r\nsea, could be accomplished in that place, where the strata of the earth\r\nhad been deposited, accumulated, consolidated, and metamorphosed.\r\n\r\nThis mineral process, which has been now described, will no doubt revolt\r\nthe opinions of many of our chemists as well as naturalists; and I\r\nshould not have thought of transcribing it, but as an example of that\r\ninconclusive reasoning which prevails in mineralogical writings upon\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. We have, upon this occasion, a most remarkable\r\nexample of the fallaceous views that may be taken of things; and of the\r\ndanger to science when men of sense and observation form suppositions\r\nfor the explanation of appearances without that strict conformity with\r\nthe principles of natural philosophy which is requited on all occasions.\r\nBoth M. de Carosi, and also M. Macquart[40], to whom our author\r\ncommunicated his ideas and proper specimens, assert, that from their\r\naccurate experience, they find calcedony growing daily, not only in the\r\nsolid body of gypsum, etc. while in the mine, but also in the solid\r\nstone when taktn out of the mine, and preserved in their cabinet.\r\n\r\n[Note 40: Vid. Essais de Minéralogie par M. Macquart.]\r\n\r\nWhat answer can be made to this positive testimony of these gentlemen,\r\nby a person who has not seen any such a thing, and who has not the\r\nopportunity of examining the cases in which those naturalists may have\r\nperhaps been led into some delusion? Were I however to conjecture upon a\r\nsubject in which I have not any positive information, I should suppose\r\nthat some part of the calcedony, like the _oculus mundi_ when dipped in\r\nwater, may be so transparent, while containing some portion of humidity,\r\nthat it is not easily distinguishable from the gypsum in which it is\r\nconcreted; but that in having the humidity evaporated, by being taken\r\nout of the mine and exposed to the dry air, those portions of calcedony,\r\nwhich did not before appear, may be perceived by becoming more\r\nopaque[41].\r\n\r\n[Note 41: From the description given in this treatise, and from the\r\ndrawings both of M. de Carosi and M. Macquart, I find a very valuable\r\ninference to be made, so much the more interesting, as I have not found\r\nany example of the like before. This arises from the intimate connection\r\nwhich is here to be perceived between agate and gypsum. Now, upon this\r\nprinciple, that the agate-calcedony had been formed by fusion, a truth\r\nwhich, from the general testimony of minerals, I must presume, it is\r\nplain, that those nodules of gypsum had been in the fluid state of\r\nfusion among those marly strata, and that the gypseous bodies had been\r\npenetrated variously with the siliceous substance of the calcedony.\r\n\r\nThe description of those siliceous penetrations of gypsum is followed by\r\nthis conclusion: \"En voila assez, je crois pour faire voir que le silex\r\nci-décrit est effectivement une émanation du gypse, et non pas une\r\nmatière hétérogène amenée d'autre part et déposée, ou nous la voyons.\"\r\nIn this instance our author had convinced himself that the calcedony\r\nconcretions had not been formed, as he and other mineralists had before\r\nsupposed, by means of infiltration; he has not, however, substituted\r\nany thing more intelligible in its stead. I do not pretend that we\r\nunderstand mineral fusion; but only that such mineral fusion is a thing\r\ndemonstrable upon a thousand occasions; and that thus is to be explained\r\nthe petrification and consolidation of the porous and naturally\r\nincoherent strata of the earth.]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a subject in which I can more freely accuse this\r\nauthor of being deceived. This naturalist says, that calcareous stones\r\nbecome silex by a certain chemical operation; and that those flinty\r\nbodies, in being exposed upon the surface of the earth, out of their\r\nnatural bed, are again, by a contrary chemical operation, changed from\r\nflint to a calcareous substance. I will give it in his own words, (p.\r\n56.)\r\n\r\n\"Cela dit, venons au fait. Tout silex progénéré de chaux, détaché de son\r\nlieu natal, et exposé aux changemens de saisons, s'amollit, reçoit de\r\ncrevasses, perd sa transparence, devient, enfin, tout-à-fait opaque, le\r\nphlogistique s'en évapore, l'acide en est détaché, lavé, et de\r\nterre vitrescible, qu'il étoit, il redevient chaux, comme il étoit\r\nauparavant.\"\r\n\r\nHere is no question with regard to mere opinion, but to matter of fact;\r\nand, in this case, nothing is more evident, than that upon the surface\r\nof this earth, that is, in the examinable parts above the level of the\r\nsea, there is no transition either of calcareous bodies into flint,\r\nnor of flinty bodies into calcareous substance. Calcareous matter is\r\nconstantly dissolved by water, when it is exposed to the washing of\r\nthat fluid; and it is even dissolved out of the most perfect union or\r\ncombination with siliceous substance, and the most solid composition of\r\nan insoluble body, as may be perceived in the decaying of feld-spar. A\r\nsuperficial view of flints, which have come out of a body of chalk, may\r\nhave created such an opinion, which will not either bear the light of\r\nchemical or mineral investigation. The subject of these chalk flints\r\nwill be minutely examined in its proper place.\r\n\r\nOur author has carefully examined the subject of flintification; and the\r\ncountry where he makes his observations would seem to be well disposed\r\nfor such a research. He has had great opportunity and inclination to\r\nexamine the subject which he writes upon; and he has given a distinct\r\naccount of what be has seen. His description of the flintification of\r\nsand-stone is extremely interesting. I will therefore transcribe it,\r\nboth as a valuable portion of natural history, and also in order to\r\ncontrast this author's opinion, with regard to the means employed by\r\nnature in petrifying bodies, and that which I maintain to be the general\r\nconsolidating operation of the globe. It is Section V. _Generation du\r\nCaillou du Silex du Grès, ou Pierre Sablonneuse_.\r\n\r\n\"Tout grès est susceptible de cette métamorphose quant au grain et quant\r\nà la couleur; depuis la bréccia quartzeuse jusqu'à la pierre à rasoir;\r\net depuis le grès blanc jusqu'au brun et presque noirâtre, tient ou non\r\ntient, dur, ou presque friable, c'est indifférent, toutes ces variétés\r\ndonnent du silex, et surtout de la calcédoine, de la cornaline, et des\r\nagathes. Quant au ciment je l'y ai toujours remarqué calcaire et faisant\r\neffervescence avec les acides dans les endroits de la pierre qui\r\nn'étoient point encore changés; et jamais je n'ai vu ce changement dans\r\ndu grès dont le ciment fut ou quartzeux ou argileux et réfractaire.\r\nAinsi le ciment entre pour quelque chose dans ce changement.\r\n\r\n\"Le commencement de cette métamorphose paroit (autant que j'ai pu\r\nl'observer dans mes débris roulés) se faire par le ciment, qui dissout\r\nlà, où les agens eurent l'accès libre, rend les grains en quartz\r\nmobiles, les emporte, les mêle avec sa masse dense-liquide, les dissout,\r\nmême en partie, et forme, dans cet état, des veines et de masses\r\ncalcédonieuse, carneoliques, ou d'une autre espèce de silex, au milieu\r\ndu grés peu, ou pas du tout, changé. Car autant que je puis voir, ce\r\nn'est pas par couches ou veines qu'elle s'opère, mais par boules et\r\nmasses rond-oblongues. Au commencement ces veines et tâches sont fort\r\nminces, et le reste du grés n'est point du tout, ou à peine sensiblement\r\nchangé hormis qu'il gagne, plus de consistence, à proportion du\r\nchangement souffert. Mais à mesure que le silex y augmente et se\r\nperfectionne, on y apperçoit les degrés par lesquels a passé cette\r\noperation. Les nuance du passage d'une pierre à l'autre deviennent plus\r\nvisibles, les veines et masses de silex grandissent au point, même,\r\nqu'il y a jusqu'aux trois quart du grés changé en silex clair comme de\r\nl'eau n'ayant que fort peu de grains de sable nageants dans sa masse.\r\nDes morceaux de cette espèce sont rares à la vérité, mais j'en ai,\r\ncependant, trouvé quelques uns. Ordinairement, dans les beaux morceaux,\r\nle silex fait la base, et le sable y est, comme nageant tantôt en grains\r\nséparés tantôt en parties et flocons. Dans les pieces moins belles, le\r\nsable fait la base, et le silex sert à la fois de ciment, et forme aussi\r\nplus ou moins de veines, qui traversent la masse en maintes et maintes\r\ndirections. Mais si c'est un grès à gros grains, ou de la bréccia, alors\r\nle reste prend la nature silicieuse mêlé de sable fin, et les gros\r\ngrains de quartz restent tels, qu'ils étoient, sans changer. J'ai\r\ndéjà remarqué que cette métamorphose semble s'opérer, comme celle des\r\ncailloux d'origine calcaire en forme approchans la sphérique, il faut\r\nencore y a jouter, que j'ai lieu de croire, qu'elle se fasse aussi du\r\ndedans en dehors, tout, comme la décomposition se fait du dehors au\r\ndedans.\r\n\r\n\"Il arrive dans cette pierre, comme dans toute autre, qu'il se forme\r\ndes crystallisations dans les cavités. Lorsqu'elles sont de silex, leur\r\nfigure est toujours mamelonnée, mais leur eau ou pureté, leur grandeur\r\net leur couleur n'est pas par tout égale. Il y en a qui sont grands, et\r\nde la plus pure calcédoine, d'autres sont petits et chaque goutte ou\r\nmamelon contient un grain de sable, de facon que cela a l'air d'un grès\r\ncrystallisé en mamelons ou stalagmitique. D'autres encore sont, de\r\ncalcédoine, mais recouverts d'une croûte, tantôt blanche qui fait\r\neffervescence avec l'acide minéral, et qui est, par conséquent, de\r\nnature calcaire; tantôt cette croûte est bleue foncée nuancée de\r\nbleu-celeste; tantôt, enfin, elle est noire, mais toutes les deux\r\nréfractaires. Outre ces crystallisations silicieuses, il y en a, quoique\r\nrarement, de quartzeuses, qui ou forment de petites veines de crystal,\r\nou bien des groupes de crystaux quartzeux, ou qui enfin, enduisent les\r\nmamelons de silex.\"\r\n\r\nOur author then makes a specification of the different varieties; after\r\nwhich he continues, p. 69.\r\n\r\n\"Après tout ceci, l'on conviendra j'espère, que nôtre grais est une\r\npierre bien singulière, et surpassant, à bien des égards, le grais,\r\nfaussement dit crystallisé, de Fontainebleau. La raison de la figure du\r\ngrais François est fort évidente, c'est le spath calcaire, qui lui\r\nsert de ciment, qui la lui fit prendre; mais qu'est-ce qui opère les\r\nmétamorphoses racontées dans notre grais siliceux? Seroit-ce son ciment\r\ncalcaire ou marneux par les mêmes raisons, qui font changer la marne en\r\nsilex? La chose est très-probable, et je n'en saurois pas même, deviner\r\nd'autre. En ce cas la nature auroit un moyen d'opérer par la voie\r\nhumide, ce que nous faisons dans nos laboratoires en quelque façon, par\r\nla voie sèche, c, a, d, de fondre et liquéfier la terre vitrescible, au\r\nmoyen des alcalis; secret que nous lui avons déjà arraché en partie, en\r\nfaisant la liqueur silicieuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Je n'ose, cependant, décider pas même hypothétiquement, sur cette\r\nmatière, pour n'avoir pu observer la nature dans ses ateliers, et parce\r\nque je ne possède que des pièces, qui détachées de leur lieu natal,\r\ndepuis un très long-tems, furent exposées aux intempéries des saisons,\r\noù elles peuvent avoir souffert bien de changemens.\"\r\n\r\nThere cannot be a more fair exposition of facts; and it is only our\r\nauthor's opinion of this mineral transmutation that I would controvert.\r\nI do not pretend to understand the manner of operating that our author\r\nhere supposes nature to take. I only maintain, that here, as every where\r\nin general, the loose and incoherent strata of the globe have been\r\npetrified, that is, consolidated, by means of the fusion of their\r\nsubstances; and this I think is confirmed from the accurate description\r\nhere given of the flintification of sand-stone. Here is described very\r\ndistinctly an appearance which is very common or general on those\r\noccasions; this is the parts or particles of stone floating in the fluid\r\nsiliceous substance, and there dissolving more or less.\r\n\r\nM. de Carosi describes very systematically the generation of silex,\r\ncalcedony, onyx, and quartz, in calcareous earth, marl, gypsum,\r\nsand-stone, and also what he terms _terre glaise, ou de l'Argile_. It is\r\nin this last that we find a perfect analogy with what is so frequent in\r\nthis country of Scotland. These are the agates, calcedonies, calcareous\r\nand zeolite nodules, which are found produced in our whin-stone\r\nor subterraneous lavas, that is, the amygdaloides of Crondstedt.\r\nNaturalists explain the formation of those nodular bodies differently.\r\nThe Chevalier de Dolomieu supposes these rocks to have been erupted\r\nlavas, originally containing cavities; and that these cavities in the\r\nsolid rock had been afterwards filled and crystallised, by means of\r\ninfiltration, with the different substances which are found variously\r\nconcreted and crystallised within the solid rocks. Our author, on the\r\ncontrary, supposes these formed by a species of chemical transmutation\r\nof calcareous and argillaceous earths, which, if not altogether\r\nincomprehensible, is at least not in any degree, so far as I know, a\r\nthing to be understood.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place where that subject of these particular rocks,\r\nwhich is extremely interesting, is to be examined. We shall afterwards\r\nhave occasion to treat of that matter at large. It is sufficient here to\r\nobserve, that our author finds occasion to generalise the formation of\r\nthose petrifactions with the flintifications in calcareous and gypseous\r\nbodies. When, therefore, the formation of any of them shall be\r\ndemonstrated, as having taken its origin in the fusion of those\r\nsubstances, this mode of operation, which is generalised in the\r\nconsolidation of strata, will be properly inferred in all the rest.\r\n\r\nPetrifaction is a subject in which mineralogists have perhaps wandered\r\nmore widely from the truth than in any other part of natural history;\r\nand the reason is plain. The mineral operations of nature lie in a part\r\nof the globe which is necessarily inaccessible to man, and where the\r\npowers of nature act under very different conditions from those which we\r\nfind take place in the only situation where we can live. Naturalists,\r\ntherefore, finding in stalactical incrustation a cause for the formation\r\nof stone, in many respects analogous to what is found in the strata of\r\nthe earth, and which had come from the mineral region in a consolidated\r\nstate, have, without due consideration, attributed to this cause all the\r\nappearances of petrifaction or mineral concretion. It has been one of\r\nthe objects of this work to show that this operation of incrustation,\r\nor petrifaction by means of solution, is altogether ineffectual for\r\nproducing mineral concretions; and that, even were it capable of forming\r\nthose mineral bodies, yet that, in the solid parts of this earth, formed\r\nby a deposit of travelled materials at the bottom of the sea, the\r\nconditions necessary to this incrustating process do not take place.\r\n\r\nThose enlightened naturalists who have of late been employed in\r\ncarefully examining the evidences of mineral operations, are often\r\nstaggered in finding appearances inconsistent with the received doctrine\r\nof infiltration; they then have recourse to ingenious suppositions, in\r\norder to explain that enigma. In giving examples of this kind. I have in\r\nview both to represent the natural history these mineralists furnish\r\nus with, which is extremely interesting, and also to show the various\r\nshapes in which error will proceed, when ingenious men are obliged to\r\nreason without some necessary principle in their science. We have just\r\nnow had an example in Europe; I will next present the reader with one\r\nfrom Asia.\r\n\r\nM. Patrin, in his _Notice Minéralogique de la Daourie_, (Journal de\r\nPhysique, Mars 1791) gives us a very distinct account of what he met\r\nwith in that region. Describing the country of Doutchersk upon the river\r\nArgun, in Siberia, he proceeds thus:\r\n\r\n\"Ces colines sont formées d'un hornstein gris qui paroit se convertir en\r\npierre calcaire par l'action des météores; car tout celui qu'on prend\r\nhors du contact de l'air donne les plus vives étincelles, et ne fait pas\r\nla moindre effervescence avec les acides, même après avoir été calciné;\r\net l'on observe celui qui est à découvert, passer, par nuances\r\ninsensibles, jusqu'à l'état de pierre calcaire parfaite de couleur\r\nblanchâtre.\"\r\n\r\nHere M. Patrin has persuaded himself, probably from an imperfect\r\nexamination of the subject, that there takes place a mineral\r\nmetamorphosis, which certainly is not found in any other part of the\r\nearth, and for which he does not find any particular cause. The natural\r\neffect of the meteors, in other parts of the earth, is to dissolve the\r\ncalcareous substance out of bodies exposed to those agents; and the\r\ngradation from the one of those two things to the other, which seems to\r\nbe the data on which he had proceeded in forming his conclusion, is not\r\nsufficient to prove the metamorphosis, even were there not so strong a\r\nphysical objection to it; for, it is by no means unusual for mineral\r\nbodies to graduate thus from one substance to another. However that be,\r\nthis is not the principal object of the example[42].\r\n\r\n[Note 42: Here we have well informed naturalists reasoning with all the\r\nlight of our present mineralogy, and maintaining, on the one hand, that\r\ngypsum is transformed into calcedony, by the operation of the meteors,\r\nor some such cause; and, on the other, that a siliceous substance is by\r\nthe same means converted into lime-stone. What should we now conclude\r\nfrom this?--That calcareous and siliceous substances were mutually\r\nconvertible. But then this is only in certain districts of Poland and\r\nSiberia. Every where, indeed, we find strange mixtures of calcareous and\r\nsiliceous bodies; but neither mineralists nor chemists have, from these\r\nexamples, ventured to affirm a metamorphosis, which might have spared\r\nthem much difficulty in explaining those appearances.\r\n\r\nThis is a subject that may be taken in very different lights. In one\r\nview, no doubt, there would appear to be absurdity in the doctrine of\r\nmetamorphosis, as there is now a days acknowledged to be in that of\r\n_lusus naturae_; and those reasoning mineralists might thus, in the\r\nopinion of some philosophers, expose their theory to contempt and\r\nridicule. This is not the light in which I view the subject. I give\r\nthose gentlemen credit for diligently observing nature; and I applaud\r\nthem for having the merit to reason for themselves, which would seem to\r\nbe the case with few of the many naturalists who now speak and write\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\nLet us now draw an inference, with regard to this, in judging of the\r\ndifferent theories. Either the received system concerning mineral\r\noperations is just, in which case those gentlemen, who employ a secret\r\nmetamorphosis, may be to blame in laying it aside; or it is erroneous\r\nand deficient; and, in that case, they have the merit of distinguishing\r\nthe error or deficiency of the prevailing system. How far they have seen\r\nthe system of nature, in those examples which they have described,\r\nis another question. In the mean time, I am to avail myself of the\r\ntestimony of those gentlemen of observation, by which the insufficiency\r\nat least of the received mineral system is acknowledged.]\r\n\r\nAfter speculating upon the effect of the ancient ocean upon the\r\nmountains of that country, he proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Je laisse ces conjectures pour remarquer un fait singulier: la colline,\r\nqui est au nord de l'église de la fonderie, a son arrête composée de ce\r\nhornstein qui se décompose en pierre calcaire; mais ici, les parties,\r\nqui sont ainsi décomposées, offrent une substance calcédonieuse\r\ndisposées par zones concentriques, comme on l'observe dans les agates\r\nd'oberstein; mais ce ne sont point ici des corps parasites formés par\r\ninfiltration dans des cavités pré-existantes comme les agates; on voit\r\nque ce sont les parties constituantes de la roche qui, _par un\r\ntravail interne_, et par une sorte de crystallisation, out pris cette\r\ndisposition régulière (que ce mot de _crystallisation_ ne révolte point,\r\nj'appelle ainsi toute tendance à prendre une forme constante, polyèdre\r\nou non polyèdre.) Les couches les plus voisine du centre sont nettes et\r\ndistinctes; peu-à-peu elles le sont moins, et enfin elles s'évanouissent\r\net se confondent avec le fond de la roche. Chaque assemblage de ces\r\nzones a une forme ronde ou ovale plus ou moins régulière de sept à huit\r\npouces de diamètre.\r\n\r\n\"Cela ressemble en grand à ce qu'on observe dans les pierres oeillées,\r\net la cause est vraisemblablement la même. Je le répète, je regarde\r\ncette disposition régulière comme une véritable cristallisation, qui\r\npeut s'opérer et qui s'opère en effet dans l'intérieur des corp les plus\r\nsolide, tant qu'ils sont fournis à l'action des agens de la nature.\r\n\r\n\"Tous ceux qui visitent l'intérieur de la terre savent que les roches\r\nmêmes le plus compactes y sont intimement pénétrées d'humidité, et ce\r\nfluide n'est certainement pas l'eau pure; c'est l'agent qui opère toutes\r\nles agrégations, toutes les cristallisations, tous les travaux de la\r\nnature dans le règne minéral. On peut donc aisément concevoir qu'à la\r\nfaveur de ce fluide, il règne, dans les parties les plus intimes des\r\ncorps souterrains, une circulation qui fait continuellement changer de\r\nplace aux élémens de la matière, jusqu'a ce que réunis par la force des\r\naffinités, les corpuscules similaires prennent la forme que la nature\r\nleur a assignée.\"\r\n\r\nThose nodular bodies or figured parts which are here inclosed in the\r\nrock, are evidently what may be called calcedony agates. M. Patrin is\r\npersuaded, from the examination of them, that they had not been formed\r\nin the manner of German agates, which he supposes is by mean of\r\ninfiltration; and he has endeavoured to conceive another manner of\r\noperating, still however by means of water, which I suppose, according\r\nto this hypothesis, is to dissolve substances in one part, and deposits\r\nthem in another, There must certainly be some great _desideratum_ in\r\nthat mineral philosophy which is obliged to have recourse to such\r\nviolent suppositions. First, water is not an universal solvent, as it\r\nwould require to be, upon this supposition; secondly, were water allowed\r\nto be an universal menstruum, here is to be established a circulation\r\nthat does not naturally arise from the mixture of water and earth; and,\r\nlastly, were this circulation to be allowed, it would not explain the\r\nvariety which is found in the consolidation and concretion of mineral\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nSo long, therefore, as we are to explain natural appearances by\r\nreasoning from known principles, and not by ascribing those effects to\r\npreternatural causes, we cannot allow of this regular operation which\r\nM. Patrin alleges to be acting in the interior parts of the most solid\r\nbodies. This is indeed evident, that there has been a cause operating\r\nin the internal parts of the most solid bodies, a cause by which the\r\nelements, or constituent parts of those solid bodies, have been moved\r\nand regularly disposed, as this author very well observes must have been\r\nthe case in our agates or eyed stones; but to ascribe to water this\r\neffect, or to employ either an ineffectual or an unknown cause, is not\r\nto reason philosophically with regard to the history of nature; it is to\r\nreason phantastically, and to imagine fable.\r\n\r\nM. Monnet has imagined a petrifying power in water very different\r\nfrom any that has hitherto been conceived, I believe, by natural\r\nphilosophers, and I also believe, altogether inconsistent with\r\nexperience or matter of fact; but as it is not without good reason that\r\nthis naturalist has been induced to look out for a petrifying cause\r\ndifferent from any hitherto supposed, and as he has endeavoured very\r\nproperly to refute the systems of petrification hitherto received,\r\nI would beg leave to transcribe his reasoning upon the subject in\r\ncorroboration of the present theory of consolidation by the means of\r\nfusion.\r\n\r\nIt is upon occasion of describing one of the species of alpine stone\r\nor schistus which contains quartzy particles. _Nouveau voyage\r\nminéralogique, etc._ Journal de Physique Aoust 1784.\r\n\r\n\"Il y a loin de cette pierre, que je regarde comme une variété de roches\r\nardoisées, aux véritable ardoises. La composition de toutes ces pierres\r\nest due aux terres quartzeuses et argileuses, et à la terre talqueuse,\r\nque je démontrerai un jour être une espèce particulière et distincte des\r\nautres, qui constitue les bonnes ardoises, et fait, ainsi que le quartz,\r\nqu'elles résistent aux injures de l'air, sans s'effleurir, comme je\r\nferai voir que cette terre, qu'on désignera sous la dénomination de\r\nterre talqueuse, si l'on veut, résiste au grand feu sans se fondre. Les\r\ndifférences de toutes ces pierres, quoique composées des mêmes matières,\r\nmais dans des proportions différentes, sont frappantes, et pourroient\r\nfaire croire qu'elles n'appartiennent pas à ce genre. Mais qui ne voit\r\nici que toutes ces différences, ou ces variétés, ne sont dues qu'aux\r\nmodifications de la matière première, qu'elle a éprouvées, soit en se\r\nmêlant avec des matières hétérogènes, prévenantes du débris des êtres\r\nqui ont existé, comme l'argile, par exemple, qui, de l'aveu de presque\r\ntous les naturalistes, est le produit de l'organization des plantes, ou\r\nsoit en se mêlant avec de la matière déjà solidifiée depuis long-temps?\r\nOr nous ne craignons pas de dire, ce que nous avons dit plusieurs fois\r\nquand l'occasion s'en est présentée, que cette matière unique, que\r\nse modifie selon les occasions et les circonstances, et qui prend\r\nun caractère analogue au matières qu'elle rencontre, est l'eau, que\r\nbeaucoup de naturalistes cherchent vainement ailleurs. Ils ne peuvent\r\ncomprendre, malgré les exemples frappans qui pourroient les porter à\r\nadopter cette opinion, que ce fluide général soit l'élément des corps\r\nsolides du règne minéral, comme il est de ceux du règne végétal et du\r\nrègne animal. L'on cherche sérieusement, par des expériences chimiques,\r\nà découvrir si l'eau est susceptible de se convertir en terre comme\r\nsi la nature n'avoit pas d'autre moyen que nous de la faire passer de\r\nl'état fluide à l'état solide. Voyez le spath calcaire et le quartz\r\ntransparens; est il à présumer qu'ils ne sont que le résultat du dépôt\r\ndes matières terreuses fait par les eaux? Mais, dans ce ca-là encore,\r\nil faut supposer que l'eau qui est restée entre ces partie s'est\r\nsolidifiée; car, qu'est-elle donc devenue, et quel est donc le lien qui\r\na uni ces parties et leur a fait prendre une forme régulière? Il est\r\nvrai qu'on nous parle d'un suc lapidifique; mais c'est-la un être de\r\nraison, dont il seroit bien plus difficile d'établir l'existence, que de\r\ncroire à la solidification de l'eau. On nous donne cependant comme un\r\nprincipe certain que l'eau charie d'un lieu à un autre les matières\r\nqu'il a dissoutes, et qu'elle les dépose à la maniere des sels. Mais\r\nc'est supposer une chose démentie par l'experience; savoir, que l'eau\r\nait la propriété de dissoudre les matières terreuses, telles que la\r\nquartzeuse. A la vérité, M. Auchard de Berlin y joint de l'air fixe;\r\nmais cet air fixe ne sauroit tenir en dissolution un atome de quartz\r\ndans l'eau; et quelle qu'ait été l'exactitude de ceux qui ont répété\r\nles expériences de M. Auchard, on n'a pu réussir à imiter la nature,\r\nc'est-à-dire, à former des cristaux quartzeux, comme il a annoncé. Que\r\nl'eau ait la faculté de tenir en dissolution quelques petites parties\r\nde terre calcaire, au moyen de cet air fixe, il n'en faut pas conclure\r\nqu'elle puisse former de cette maniere tous les cristaux calcaires, sans\r\nque l'eau elle-même y concoure pour sa part; car ce seroit conclure\r\nquelque fois que la partie seroit égale au tout. Voyez ces géodes\r\ncalcaire et argileuses, qui renferment des cristaux nombreux de quartz\r\nou de spath calcaire; ne sont ils que le résultat du dépôt de l'eau\r\nqui y a été renfermée, ou que la cristallization pure et simple des\r\nmolécules que vous supposez avoir été tenues en dissolution par cette\r\neau? Il naîtroit de cette opinion une foule d'objections qu'il seroit\r\nimpossible de résoudre. Cependant M. Guettard, dans la minéralogie du\r\nDauphiné, qui vient de paroître, ouvrage très-estimable à beaucoup\r\nd'égards, explique, selon cette maniere de penser, la formation de\r\ncristallizations quartzeuses qu'on trouve dans certaines géodes de\r\ncette province, et celle des mines de cristal des hautes montagnes. En\r\nsupposant même comme vraie l'explication qu'il en donne, on trouveroit\r\nen cela un des plus grands problème, et des plus difficiles à résoudre\r\nqu'il y ait en minéralogie; car d'abord il faudroit expliquer comment un\r\nsi petite quantité d'eau que celle qui a été renfermée dans les géodes,\r\net celle qui est parvenue dans les fentes des rochers, ont pu fournir\r\nun si grande quantité de matière que celle qui constitue ces\r\ncristallisations, et ce qui n'est pas le moins difficile à concevoir,\r\ncomment l'eau a pu charrier cette matière à travers tant de matières\r\ndifférentes, et la conserver précisément pour cette destination;\r\ncomment, par exemple, l'eau est venue déposer de la terre quartzeuse\r\ndans les masses énormes de pierres calcaires, qui forment la côté qui\r\ndomine le village de Champigny, à quatre lieues de Paris, au delà de\r\nSaint-maur; car s'il nous faut citer un exemple frappant de cette\r\nsingularité, et à portée d'être vue des naturalistes qui sont dans la\r\ncapitale, je ne puis mieux faire que de citer cette côté, une des plus\r\ncurieuses de la France, et que je me propose de fair connoître en détail\r\ndans la troisième partie de la minéralogie de la France. On verra,\r\ndis-je, dans cette bonne pierre à chaux, et une de plus pure des\r\nenvirons de Paris, de très-abondantes cristallisations de quartz\r\ntransparent, et quelque fois de belle eau, que les ouvriers sont forcés\r\nde séparer de la partie calcaire, à laquelle elles adhèrent fortement.\r\nMais c'est trop nous arrêter à combattre une opinion qui doit son\r\norigine aux premières idées qu'ont eues les premiers observateurs en\r\nminéralogie, qui se détruira d'elle même comme tant d'autres dont il\r\nnous reste à peine le souvenir.\"\r\n\r\nWe find here an accurate naturalist, and a diligent observer, who, in\r\nconformity with what my sentiments are upon the subject, thinks it\r\nimpossible that the crystallizations in close cavities, and concretions\r\nof different solid substances within each other, which so frequently\r\noccur in the mineral regions, could have been produced, by means of\r\nsolution and crystallization, from a fluid vehicle. But what has he\r\nnow substituted in place of this solution, in order to explain\r\nappearances?--a mere supposition, viz. that nature may have the power\r\nof converting water, in those secret places, into some other thing; or\r\nrather that the substance of water is here converted into every other\r\nthing; for, though he has only mentioned quartz and calcareous spar,\r\nwhat mineral substance is there that may not be found in those close\r\ncavities? They are actually almost all, not even excepting gold; for,\r\nsmall grains of gold are inclosed within the cavities of a porous stone,\r\nin the Siberian mine. Now, for what purpose should nature, (to the power\r\nof which we are not to set a limit) have such an object in view as\r\nto convert water into every thing, unless it were to confound human\r\nunderstanding? For, so far as human experience has been as yet able to\r\nreach, there would appear to be certain elementary substances; and among\r\nthese is water, or the principles of that fluid[43]. But because water\r\nis so generally found in bodies, and so necessarily in most of the\r\noperations of this world, why convert it into every other thing? Surely,\r\nfor no better reason than that there has not occurred to this mineralist\r\nany other way of explaining certain natural appearances which aqueous\r\nsolution could not produce. Here is no dispute about a matter of fact;\r\nit is on all hands allowed, that in certain cavities, inaccessible to\r\nany thing but heat and cold, we find mineral concretions, which contain\r\nno water, and which, according to the known operations of nature, water\r\ncould not have produced; must we therefore have recourse to water acting\r\naccording to no known principle, that is to say, are we to explain\r\nnature by a preternatural cause?\r\n\r\n[Note 43: Water is now considered by men of science, as a compound\r\nsubstance; this doctrine, which seems to follow so necessarily from the\r\nexperiments of the French philosophers, must be tried by the growing\r\nlight of chemical science. In the oxygenating operation of inflammable\r\nand combustible bodies when burning, those ingenious chemists overlooked\r\nthe operation of _phlogistic matter_, which has no weight, and\r\nwhich escapes on that occasion, as I have had occasion to show in a\r\ndissertation upon phlogiston, and in the Philosophy of Light, Heat,\r\nand Fire. How far this view, which I have given of those interesting\r\nexperiments, may lead to the explanation of other collateral phenomena,\r\nsuch as that of the water produced, I will not pretend to conjecture.\r\nOne thing is evident, that if the weight of the water, procured in\r\nburning inflammable and vital air, be equal to that of those two gasses,\r\nwe would then have reason to conclude, either that water were a compound\r\nsubstance, or that vital air, and inflammable vapour were compounds of\r\nwater and the matter of light, or solar substance.]\r\n\r\nI dare say that this is not the view that M. Monnet takes of the\r\nsubject, when he thinks to explain to himself the concretion of\r\nthose different substances by means of water; but, according to my\r\napprehension of the matter, his theory, when sifted to the bottom, will\r\nbear no other construction; and, unless he shall consider water like the\r\nmatter of heat, as capable of producing the fluidity of fusion, and of\r\nbeing also again abstracted from the fluid, by pervading the most solid\r\nbody, which would then be a substance different from water, he must\r\nemploy this aqueous substance as a menstruum or solvent for solid\r\nbodies, in the same manner as has been done by those naturalists whom\r\nhe he justly censure, and conform to those erroneous ideas which first\r\nobservations, or inaccurate knowledge of minerals, may have suggested to\r\nformer naturalists.\r\n\r\nIt is the dissolution and concretion of siliceous substance, no\r\ndoubt, that gives such difficulty to our naturalists in explaining\r\npetrifaction: they have, however, something apparently in their favour,\r\nwhich it may be proper now to mention.\r\n\r\nIn the _first_ place, although siliceous substance is not soluble, so\r\nfar as we know, by simple water, it is soluble by means of alkaline\r\nsubstance; consequently, it is possible that it may be dissolved in the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, The water of Giezer in Iceland, actually petrifies bodies\r\nwhich are alternately imbibed with that hot water and exposed to the\r\nair. This water, therefore, not only contains siliceous substance in a\r\ndissolved state, but deposits this again, either by means of cooling,\r\nor being aerated, or of evaporating. Consequently, without knowing the\r\nprinciple upon which it proceeds, we here perceive a natural operation\r\nby which siliceous petrifaction may be performed.\r\n\r\n_Lastly_, We have another principle for the dissolution of siliceous\r\nsubstance. This is the fluor acid which volatilises the siliceous\r\nsubstance. This, however, requires certain conditions, which cannot be\r\nfound as a general cause in the mineral regions.\r\n\r\nThus we would seem to have every thing necessary for explaining the\r\nconcretion and crystallization of siliceous bodies, provided we could\r\nfind the proper conditions requisite for that operation; for whether it\r\nshall be by means of acid or alkaline substances that siliceous matter\r\nis to be dissolved, volatilised, and transported from one place to\r\nanother, it is necessary that those dissolving substances should be\r\npresent upon those occasions. Nor is it sufficient only to dissolve the\r\nsiliceous substance which is to be transported; the necessary conditions\r\nfor the concretion again of the dissolved substances, whatever these may\r\nbe, are also absolutely required for this operation. Now, though those\r\nrequisite conditions may be, upon many occasions, allowed in the earth,\r\nit is not according to the theory of our modern naturalists, who explain\r\npetrifaction upon the principles of simple infiltration of water,\r\nthat any advantage can be taken of those conditions; nor are natural\r\nappearances to be explained without employing more complicated chemical\r\nagents in the mineral regions.\r\n\r\nTo this subject of the petrifactions of Giezier, I may now add the\r\ninformation which we have received in consequence of a new voyage from\r\nthis country to Iceland.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Joseph Banks returned from his expedition to Iceland, he landed\r\nat this place; and, having brought specimens of the petrifications of\r\nGiezer, Dr Black and I first discovered that these were of a siliceous\r\nsubstance. I have always conjectured that the water of Giezer must be\r\nimpregnated with flinty matter by means of an alkaline substance, and\r\nso expressed my opinion in the Theory of the Earth published in the\r\nTransactions of the Edinburgh Royal Society. We have therefore been very\r\ndesirous of procuring some of that water, in order to have it analysed.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity favourable to our views has occurred this summer. Mr\r\nStanley set out from this place with the same purpose of examining\r\nIceland. He was so good as to ask of Dr Black and I what inquiries we\r\nwould incline that he should make. We have now, by the favour of this\r\ngentleman, obtained specimens of the petrifactions of Giezer; and, what\r\nis still more interesting, we have procured some of the water of those\r\npetrifying boiling springs.\r\n\r\nIt appears from these specimens, that the boiling water which is ejected\r\nfrom those aqueous volcanoes, if we may use the expression, is endued\r\nwith the quality of forming two different species of petrifaction or\r\nincrustation; for, besides the siliceous bodies, of which we had before\r\nreceived specimens, the same stream of water incrustates its channel\r\nwith a calcareous substance. All the specimens which I have seen consist\r\nof incrustation, some purely siliceous, some calcareous, and others\r\nmixed of those two, more or less.\r\n\r\nDr Black has been analysing the water; and he finds in it siliceous\r\nmatter dissolved by an alkaline substance, in the manner of liquor\r\nsilicum[44]. My conjecture has thus been verified.\r\n\r\n[Note 44: See Trans. of the Edin. Royal Society.]\r\n\r\nIt must not be alleged that nature may operate in the mineral regions,\r\nas she does here upon the surface in the case of Giezer. Such an\r\nargument as this, however sound it may be in general, will not apply to\r\nthe subject of which we treat at present. There is no question about\r\nthe limiting the powers of nature; we are only considering nature as\r\noperating in a certain determined manner, viz. by water acting simply\r\nupon the loose materials of the land deposited at the bottom of the\r\nsea, and accumulated in regular strata, one upon another, to the most\r\nenormous depth or thickness. This is the situation and condition of\r\nthings in which nature is to operate; and we are to find the means of\r\nconsolidating those strata, and concreting every species of substance\r\nin almost every possible composition, according to some known physical\r\nprinciple. Here is an operation which is limited; for, we must reason\r\nstrictly, according to the laws of nature, in the case which we have\r\nunder consideration; and we cannot suppose nature as ever transgressing\r\nthose laws.\r\n\r\nIt is acknowledged, that, by means sometimes of an aeriform, sometimes\r\nof an alkaline, perhaps also of an acid substance, calcareous matter is\r\ndissolved in the earth, and certain metallic substances, such as lead\r\nand iron. This solution also, upon particular occasions, (where the\r\nproper conditions for separating the solvent from the dissolved\r\nsubstance exist), forms certain concretions; these are sometimes a mere\r\nincrustation, as in the case of the siliceous incrustation of Giezer,\r\nsometimes again in a crystallised or sparry form, as in the case of\r\nstalactical concretions. But here is no question of those cases where\r\nthe proper conditions may be found; first, of dissolving the substance\r\nwhich is afterwards to be concreted; secondly, of separating the\r\nmenstruum from the dissolved substance; and, lastly, of removing the\r\nfluid deprived of its solution, and of supplying a new solution in its\r\nroom; the question is, how far those concretions are formed where those\r\nconditions do not take place. Now, this last case is that of almost all\r\nmineral concretions.\r\n\r\nIt must not be here alleged that certain concretions have been found in\r\nmines posterior to these having been worked by man; consequently, that\r\nthose concretions have been formed by nothing but the infiltration of\r\nwater. In those cases, where such concretions are truly found, I am\r\npersuaded that all the conditions proper to that operation will also\r\nbe found; and it is only, I believe, in those cases where such proper\r\nconditions may be found, that this aqueous concretion ever appears. Now,\r\nif we shall except calcareous stalactite, and the bog ore of iron, How\r\nseldom is it that any appearance of those aqueous mineral concretion\r\never is found? Those very few cases in which they are found, afford the\r\nstrongest proof against these being operations general to the globe, or\r\nproper mineral concretions; because it is only where all the necessary\r\nconditions conspire in each contributing its part, that the effect is\r\naccomplished; and this is a thing which cannot possibly take place in\r\nthe aquiform strata below the surface of the sea. But, without attending\r\nto this clear distinction of things perfectly different, naturalists are\r\napt to see false analogies, and thus in generalising to form the most\r\nerroneous theories.\r\n\r\nI shall now give an example of this fallaceous manner of reasoning; it\r\nis in the case of certain mineral appearances which are erroneously\r\nconsidered as stalactical concretions.\r\n\r\nThe only true stalactical bodies are of a calcareous substance; they are\r\nformed by water containing this substance in a dissolved state; and the\r\nprinciples upon which this particular concretion is formed are well\r\nknown. It is therefore easy to compare other concretions, which may have\r\nsome superficial resemblance to these stalactical bodies, in order to\r\nsee if they have proceeded upon the same principle of concretion from\r\na dissolved state, or by water depositing its dissolved substance in a\r\nsimilar manner.\r\n\r\nThere are two different mineral substances which give appearances of\r\nthis sort. These are certain concretions of calcedony, and also of\r\niron-ore, which are thought to have such resemblance to stalactical\r\nconcretions as, by some superficial observers, to be reckoned of the\r\nsame kind. It is now proposed to show that those conclusions are not\r\nwell founded; and that, in this case of calcedony and iron-ore, it could\r\nnot be upon the principle of stalactical concretion that the bodies now\r\nin question had their forms.\r\n\r\nThe principle upon which calcareous substance is dissolved in water, and\r\nmade to concrete by the evaporation of the acid substance, or fixed\r\nair by which it had been dissolved, is too well known to require any\r\nexplanation in this place; we are only to consider the sensible effects\r\nof those operations of which we know so well the proper conditions.\r\n\r\nThere are just two distinct views under which we may consider all\r\nstalactical concretions formed; these are the incrustation of\r\nthe calcareous substance concreting upon a foreign body, and the\r\nincrustation of the same substance upon itself. By the first any manner\r\nof shape may be formed, provided there be a solid body, upon the surface\r\nof which the calcareous solution is made to pass. By the second, again,\r\nwe have various forms; but we know the principles upon which they had\r\nbeen made. These are the shape and motions of the fluid which gives the\r\ncalcareous concretion. Now, these principles are always to be perceived,\r\nmore or less, in all the bizarre or fantastical, as well as regular\r\nshapes which are produced by stalactical concretions. At present, we\r\nshall confine our views to one particular shape, which is simple,\r\nregular, and perfectly understood wherever it is formed.\r\n\r\nDrops of water falling from a roof, and forming stalactite, produce\r\nfirst tubular bodies, and then gradually consolidate and increase those\r\npendulous bodies by incrustation. These appearances are thought to be\r\nobserved in the calcedony and ferruginous concretions, which has led\r\nsome mineralists to conclude, that those concretions had been formed\r\nin the same manner, by means of water. We are now to show that these\r\nmineral appearances are not analogous to stalactites in their formation,\r\nand that they have evidently been formed in a different manner.\r\n\r\nIt must be evident, that, in the formation of those pendulous bodies,\r\neach distinct stalactite must be formed by a separate drop of water;\r\nconsequently, that no more stalactites can be formed in a given space,\r\nthan there could have subsisted separate drops of water. Now, a drop of\r\nwater is a very determined thing; and thus we have a principle by which\r\nto judge of those mistaken appearances.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the gut of water to be but one eighth of an inch,\r\nalthough it is a great deal more, we should have no stalactites formed\r\nnearer to each other than that measure of space. But those mineral\r\nconcretions, which are supposed to be stalactical, are contained in half\r\nthat space, or are nearer to each other than the tenth or twentieth of\r\nan inch. I have them like needles, and in every degree of proximity or\r\ncontiguity, at the same time that they are perfectly solid. Therefore,\r\nit is plainly impossible that they could have been formed upon this\r\nprinciple of calcareous stalactite. But, it is only by this false\r\nresemblance, that any argument can be formed for the concretion of those\r\nbodies from an aqueous solution; in every other respect they are true\r\nmineral concretions; and, that these have had a very different origin,\r\nhas been already the subject of investigation, and will be more\r\nparticularly examined in the course of this work.\r\n\r\nThe term _infiltration_, which has been much employed for explaining\r\nmineral appearances, is too vague, imperfect, or unexplicit, for\r\nscience, whether as the means of knowing nature, or the subject of\r\nconfutation. This is not the case with that of stalactite; here is\r\na term that implies a certain natural operation, or a most distinct\r\nprocess for attaining a certain end; and we know the principles upon\r\nwhich it proceeds, as well as the several steps that may be traced in\r\nthe general result. It is an operation which has not only been analysed\r\nto its principles; it is also a process which is performed by man,\r\nproceeding on his acquired knowledge. Now, were this operation common to\r\nthe mineral regions, as it is proper to the surface of this earth; we\r\ncould not remain in any degree of suspense with regard to the origin of\r\nthose mineral bodies; for, having the true clue of knowledge, we should\r\nbe able to unravel the most intricate and mysterious appearance. But, so\r\nfar from this being the case, the more we come to inquire into nature,\r\nand employ this principle, the less we find it applicable, and the more\r\ninvolved in darkness is our science.\r\n\r\nThe places where these false appearances of stalactite are found, are\r\nprecisely those in which, from the nature of things, all possibility for\r\nsuch an operation is excluded. For, How can this take place within a\r\ncloss cavity in the mineral regions? The term _vegetation_ may as well\r\nbe employed for the explanation of those appearances: But what would\r\nnow be said of such an explication? It is high time that science were\r\nproperly applied to the natural history of this earth, and mineralists\r\nnot allowed to impose upon themselves with false reasoning, or to please\r\nthemselves with the vain attempt of explaining visible effects by\r\nunknown causes.\r\n\r\nSuch various inconsistent opinions, respecting petrifaction or mineral\r\nconcretion, as I have now exposed, opinions that are not founded on any\r\nsound physical principle, authorise me to conclude that they are all\r\nerroneous. If this be admitted, it will follow that we have no proof\r\nof any proper mineral concretion except that which had proceeded by\r\ncongelation from the fluid state of fusion. This has been the doctrine\r\nwhich I have held out in my Theory of the Earth; and this will be more\r\nand more confirmed as we come to examine particular mineral appearances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nThe Nature of Mineral Coal, and the Formation of Bituminous Strata,\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.--Purpose of this Inquiry.\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter, I have given a perfect mark by which to judge,\r\nof every consolidated stratum, how far that had been the operation or\r\neffect of water alone, or if it had been that of heat and fusion. This\r\nis the particular veins or divisions of the consolidated stratum,\r\narising from the contraction of the mass, distended by heat, and\r\ncontracted in cooling. It is not an argument of greater or lesser\r\nprobability; it is a physical demonstration; but, so far as I see, it\r\nwould appear to be for most mineralists an unintelligible proposition.\r\nTime, however, will open the eyes of men; science will some day find\r\nadmittance into the cabinet of the curious. I will therefore now give\r\nanother proof,--not of the consolidation of mineral bodies by means\r\nof fusion, for there is no mineral body in which that proof is not\r\nfound,--but of the inconsistency of aqueous infiltration with the\r\nappearances of bodies, where not only fusion had been employed for the\r\nconsolidation, but where the application of heat is necessary, and along\r\nwith it the circumstances proper for _distillation_.\r\n\r\nShort-sighted naturalists see springs of water issuing from the earth,\r\none forming calcareous incrustations, the other depositing bituminous\r\nsubstances. Here is enough for them to make the theory of a world; on\r\nthe one hand, solid marble is explained, on the other, solid coal.\r\nIgnorance suspects not error; their first step is to reason upon a false\r\nprinciple;--no matter, were they only to reason far enough, they would\r\nsoon find their error by the absurdity into which it lands them. The\r\nmisfortune is, they reason no farther; they have explained mineralogy\r\nby infiltration; and they content themselves with viewing the beautiful\r\nspecimens in their cabinet, the supposed product of solution and\r\ncrystalization. How shall we inform such observators; How reason with\r\nthose who attend not to an argument!\r\n\r\nAs naturalists have explained all mineral concretions from aqueous or\r\nother solution, and attributed to infiltration the formation of those\r\nstony bodies in which there are marks of their original composition,\r\nso have they explained to themselves, I suppose, the origin of those\r\nbituminous bodies which are found among the strata of the earth. In the\r\ncase of stony substances, I have shown how unfounded all their theories\r\nare for the production of those concretions, crystallizations, and\r\nconsolidated bodies. I am here to examine the subject of inflammable and\r\ncombustible bodies, which I believe have been little considered by those\r\ntheorists who suppose mineral bodies consolidated by infiltration. It is\r\nhere that we shall find an infinite difference between the aqueous and\r\nigneous theories; for, we shall find it impossible to explain by the one\r\ncertain operations which must have necessarily required the great agent\r\ngenerally employed in the other.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this chapter is a touch-stone for every theory of the\r\nearth. In every quarter of this globe, perhaps in every extensive\r\ncountry, bituminous strata are to be found; they are alternated with\r\nthose which are called aquiform, or which had been evidently formed by\r\nsubsidence of certain moved materials at the bottom of the sea; so far,\r\ntherefore, all those strata have had the same origin. In this point\r\nI think I may assert, that all the different theories at present are\r\nagreed; and it is only concerning certain transformations of those\r\nstrata, since their original collection, that have been ascribed to\r\ndifferent causes.\r\n\r\nOf these transformations, which the strata must have undergone, there\r\nare two kinds; one in relation to change of place and position; the\r\nother in relation to solidity or consistence. It is only the last of\r\nthose two changes which is here to be the subject of consideration;\r\nbecause, with regard to the first, there is nothing peculiar in these\r\nbituminous strata to throw any light, in that respect, upon the others.\r\nThis is not the case with regard to the transformation in their chemical\r\ncharacter and consistence; bituminous bodies may not be affected by\r\nchemical agents, such as fire and water, in the same manner as the\r\nargillaceous, siliceous, micaceous, and such other strata that are\r\nalternated with the bituminous; and thus we may find the means for\r\ninvestigating the nature of that agent by which those strata in general\r\nhave been transformed in their substance; or we may find means for the\r\ndetecting of false theories which may have been formed with regard\r\nto those operations in which the original deposits of water had been\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nWe have had but two theories, with regard to the transformation of\r\nthose bodies which have had a known origin, or to the change of their\r\nsubstance and consistence; the one of these which I have given is that\r\nof heat or fusion; the other, which I wish to be compared with mine,\r\nis that of water and infiltration. It is by this last that all authors\r\nhitherto, in one shape or another, have endeavoured to explain the\r\nchanges that those strata must have undergone since the time of their\r\nfirst formation at the bottom of the sea. They indiscriminately apply\r\nthe doctrine of infiltration to those strata of mineral coal as to any\r\nother; they say that bituminous matter is infiltrated with the water,\r\nimpregnates certain strata of earth with bituminous matter, and thus\r\nconverts them into mineral coal, and bituminous strata. This is not\r\nreasoning physically, or by the inductive method of proceeding upon\r\nmatter of fact; it is reasoning fantastically, or by making gratuitous\r\nsupposition founded merely on imagination. It was thus that natural\r\nphilosophers reasoned before the age of science; the wonder now is,\r\nhow men of science, in the present enlightened age, should suffer such\r\nlanguage of ignorance and credulity to pass uncensured.\r\n\r\nThe subject which I am now to treat of consists of peculiar strata of\r\nthe earth, bodies which we may investigate through all the stages of\r\ntheir change, which is extreme; for, from vegetable bodies produced upon\r\nthe habitable earth, they are now become a mineral body, and the most\r\nperfect coal,--a thing extremely different from what it had been, and\r\na thing which cannot be supposed to have been accomplished by the\r\noperation of water alone, or any other agent in nature with which we\r\nare acquainted, except the action of fire or heat. It is therefore\r\nimpossible for a philosopher, reasoning upon actual physical principles,\r\nnot to acknowledge in this a complete proof of the theory which has been\r\ngiven, and a complete refutation of that aqueous operation which has\r\nbeen so inconsiderately supposed as consolidating the strata of the\r\nearth, and forming the various mineral concretions which are found in\r\nthat great body.\r\n\r\nTo see this, it will be sufficient to trace the progress of vegetable\r\nand animal substances, (bodies which had certainly lived by means of a\r\nformer earth), to this changed state in which they have become perfect\r\nmineral bodies, and constitute a part of the present earth. For, as\r\nthese changes are perfectly explained by the one theory, and absolutely\r\ninconsistent with the other, there arises from this a conviction that\r\nmust be irresistible to a person who can give proper attention to a\r\nchain of reasoning from effect to cause.\r\n\r\nBut if we thus succeed to illustrate the theory of the earth by the\r\nnatural history of those particular strata, we have but one step farther\r\nto make in order to bring all the other parts of the earth, whether\r\nstratified or not, into the most perfect consistence with the theory;\r\nnow this step, it will be most easy to make; and I shall now mention\r\nit, that so the reader may keep it in his view: Pyrites is a\r\nsulphureo-metallic substance, which cannot be produced by means of\r\nwater, a substance which the influences of the atmosphere decomposes or\r\nseparates into its elements, and which even our imperfect art may\r\nbe considered as able to produce, by means of fusion in our fires.\r\nTherefore, the finding of this creature of fire intimately connected\r\nwith those consolidated strata of mineral coal, adds the greatest\r\nconfirmation, were it necessary, to the doctrine of those mineral bodies\r\nhaving been consolidated by fusion. This confirmation, however, is\r\nnot necessary, and it is not the only thing which I am at present to\r\nillustrate in that doctrine. What I have now in view is, to homologate\r\nthe origin of those coal strata, with the production of every other\r\nmineral substance, by heat or fusion; and this is what the intimate\r\nconnection of pyrites with those strata will certainly accomplish. This\r\nwill be done in the following manner:\r\n\r\nPyrites is not only found in great masses along with the coal strata; it\r\nis contained in the veins which traverse those strata, and in the minute\r\nramifications of those veins, which are occasioned by the contraction of\r\nthe mass, and generally divide it into small cubical pieces; but besides\r\nthat extrinsic connection, (as it may be called,) with the stratum of\r\ncoal, pyrites is found intimately connected with that solid body, in\r\nbeing mixed with its substance. If, therefore, it were proved, that\r\neither the one or other of those two substances had been consolidated by\r\nfusion, the other must be acknowledged as having had the same origin;\r\nbut now I am to prove, from the natural history of mineral coal, that\r\npyrites had been there formed by fusion; and then, by means of the\r\nknown origin of that sulphureo-metallic substance, we shall extend our\r\nknowledge to the origin of every other mineral body.\r\n\r\nThe process of this argument is as follows: Every mineral body, I\r\nbelieve, without exception, will be found so intimately connected with\r\npyrites, that these two things must be concluded as having been together\r\nin a fluid state, and that, whatever may have been the cause of fluidity\r\nin the one, this must have also caused the fluidity in the other;\r\nconsequently, whatever shall be proved with regard to the mineral\r\noperations of pyrites, must be considered as proved of every other\r\nmineral substance. But, from the connection of pyrites with mineral\r\ncoal, it is to be proved that the origin of this metallic body had been\r\nfusion; and then it will appear, that all other mineral bodies must have\r\nbeen more or less in fusion, or that they must have been consolidated\r\nby means of heat, and not by any manner of solution or aqueous\r\ninfiltration. I therefore now proceed to take a view of the natural\r\nhistory of coal strata,--a subject which mineralogists seem not inclined\r\nto engage with, although the most ample data are to be found for that\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.--Natural History of Coal Strata, and Theory of this\r\nGeological Operation.\r\n\r\nFossil coal is the species of stratum best understood with regard to its\r\naccidents, as being much sought after; at least, this is the case in\r\nmany parts of Britain, where it supplies the place of wood for burning.\r\nThis fossil body has the most distinguished character; for, being\r\ninflammable or combustible in its nature, there is no other species of\r\nstratum that may be confounded with it.\r\n\r\nBut, though coal be thus the most distinguishable mineral, and that\r\nwhich is best understood in the science of mining, it is perhaps the\r\nmost difficult to be treated of in the science of mineralogy; for,\r\nnot having properly any distinguishable parts, we have nothing in the\r\nnatural constitution of this body, as we have in most other strata, to\r\nlead us to the knowledge of its original state or first formation.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of coal are distinguished by their different manner of\r\nburning; but, from appearances of this kind, no perfect judgement can be\r\nformed with regard to the specific manner in which those strata had been\r\nmade; although, from chemical principles, some conclusion may be drawn\r\nconcerning certain changes which they have undergone since they had been\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThus we have one species of coal which is extremely fusible, abounds\r\nwith oil, and consequently is inflammable; we have another species again\r\nwhich is perfectly fixed and infusible in the fire; therefore, we may\r\nconclude upon principle, that, however, both those coals must have\r\nundergone the operation of heat and fusion, in bringing them to their\r\npresent state, it is only the last that has become so much evaporated as\r\nto become perfectly fixed, or so perfectly distilled, as to have been\r\nreduced to a caput mortuum.\r\n\r\nThe argument here employed is founded upon this fact; that, from the\r\nfusible species of coal, a caput mortuum may be formed by distillation,\r\nand that this chemical production has every essential quality, or every\r\npeculiar property, of the fixed and infusible species; although, from\r\nthe circumstances of our operation, this caput mortuum may not have\r\nprecisely the exterior appearance of the natural coal. But, we have\r\nreason to believe, it is not in the nature of things to change the\r\ninfusible species, so as to make it fusible or oily. Now, that this body\r\nwas not formed originally in its present state, must appear from this,\r\nthat the stratum here considered is perfectly solid; but, without\r\nfusion, this could not have been attained; and the coal is now supposed\r\nto be infusible. Consequently, this fixed substance, which is now,\r\nproperly speaking, a perfect coal, had been originally an oily\r\nbituminous or fusible substance. It is now a fixed substance, and an\r\ninfusible coal; therefore, it must have been by means of heat and\r\ndistillation that it had been changed, from the original state in which\r\nthis stratum had been formed.\r\n\r\nWe have thus, in the examination of coal strata upon chemical\r\nprinciples, received a certain lesson in geology, although this does not\r\nform a proper distinction by which to specify those strata in general,\r\nor explain the variety of that mineral. For, in this manner, we\r\ncould only distinguish properly two species of those strata; the one\r\nbituminous or inflammable; the other proper coal, burning without smoke\r\nor flame. Thus it will appear that, as this quality of being perfectly\r\ncharred is not originally in the constitution of the stratum, but an\r\naccident to which some strata of every species may have been subjected,\r\nwe could not class them by this property without confounding together\r\nstrata which had differences in their composition or formation.\r\nTherefore, we are led to inquire after some other distinction, which may\r\nbe general to strata of fossil coal, independent of those changes which\r\nthis substance may have undergone after it had been formed in a stratum.\r\n\r\nPerfect mineral coal being a body of undistinguishable parts, it is only\r\nin its resolution that we may analyse it, and this is done by burning.\r\nThus, in analysing coal by burning, we have, in the ashes alone, that by\r\nwhich one species of coal may be distinguished from another; and, if we\r\nshould consider pure coal as having no ashes of itself, we should then,\r\nin the weight of its ashes, have a measure of the purity of the coal,\r\nthis being inversely as the quantity of the ashes. Now, though this be\r\nnot accurately true, as the purest coal must have some ashes proper to\r\nitself, yet, as this is a small matter compared with the quantity of\r\nearthy matter that may be left in burning some species of coal, this\r\nmethod of analysis may be considered as not far removed from the truth.\r\n\r\nBut, in distinguishing fossil coal by this species of chemical analysis,\r\nnot only is there to be found a perfect or indefinite gradation from a\r\nbody which is perfectly combustible to one that is hardly combustible in\r\nany sensible degree, we should also fall into an inconveniency similar\r\nto that already mentioned, of confounding two things extremely different\r\nin their nature, a bituminous body, and a perfect charcoal. Thus, if we\r\nshall found our distinction upon the fusibility and different degree of\r\nhaving been charred, we shall confound fossil coals of very different\r\ndegrees of value in burning, or of very different compositions as\r\nstrata; if, again, we found it upon the purity of composition, in\r\njudging from the ashes, we shall confound fossil bodies of very\r\ndifferent qualities, the one burning with much smoke and flame, the\r\nother without any; the one fusible almost like wax, the other fixed and\r\ninfusible as charcoal.\r\n\r\nIt will now appear, that what cannot be done in either the one or other\r\nof those two methods, may in a great degree, or with considerable\r\npropriety, be performed in employing both.\r\n\r\nThus, whether for the economical purposes of life, or the natural\r\nhistory of fossil coal, those strata should be considered both with\r\nregard to the purity of their composition as inflammable matter\r\ndeposited at the bottom of the sea, and to the changes which they\r\nhave afterwards undergone by the operation of subterranean heat and\r\ndistillation.\r\n\r\nWe have now considered the original matter of which coal strata are\r\ncomposed to be of two kinds; the one pure bitumen or coal, as being\r\nperfectly inflammable or combustible; the other an earthy matter,\r\nwith which proper coal may be variously mixed in its composition, or\r\nintimately connected, in subsiding from that suspended state by which it\r\nhad been carried in the ocean. It is a matter of great importance, in\r\nthe physiology of this globe, to know that the proper substance of coal\r\nmay be thus mixed with heterogeneous bodies; for, supposing that this\r\nearthy matter, which has subsided in the water along with coal, be no\r\nfarther connected with the combustible substance of those strata, than\r\nthat it had floated in the waters of the ocean, and subsided _pari\r\npassu_ with the proper materials of the coal, we hence learn a great\r\ndeal with regard to the state in which the inflammable matter must have\r\nbeen at the time of its formation into strata. This will appear by\r\nconsidering, that we find schistus mixed with coal in the most equal or\r\nuniform manner, and in almost every conceivable degree, from the purest\r\ncoal to the most perfect schistus. Hence we have reason to conclude,\r\nthat, at the formation of those strata, the bituminous matter, highly\r\nsubtilised, had been uniformly mixed with the earth subsiding in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nNot only is the bituminous matter of coal found mixed in every different\r\nproportion with the earthy or uninflammable materials of strata, but the\r\ncoaly or bituminous composition is found with perhaps every different\r\nspecies of substance belonging to strata. This is certain, that we have\r\nthe coaly matter intimately mixed with argillaceous and with calcareous\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nThus it will appear, that it is no proper explanation of the formation\r\nof coal strata, to say that vegetable matter is the basis of those\r\nstrata; for though, in vegetation, a substance proper for the formation\r\nof bituminous matter is produced, it remains to know by what means, from\r\na vegetable body, this bituminous matter is produced, and how it comes\r\nto be diffused in that subtile state by which it may be uniformly mixed\r\nwith the most impalpable earth in water. Could we once resolve this\r\nquestion, every other appearance might be easily explained. Let us\r\ntherefore now endeavour to discover a principle for the resolving of\r\nthis problem.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways in which vegetable bodies may be, in part at least,\r\nresolved into that subtilised state of bituminous matter after which we\r\ninquire; the one of these is by means of fire, the other by water. We\r\nshall now consider these severally as the means of forming bituminous\r\nstrata, although they may be both employed by nature in this work.\r\n\r\nWhen vegetable bodies are made to burn, there is always more or less of\r\na fuliginous substance formed; but this fuliginous substance is no\r\nother than a bituminous body in that subtilised state in which it is\r\nindefinitely divided, and may be mixed uniformly with any mass of matter\r\nequally subtilised with itself. But this is precisely what we want, in\r\norder to compose the strata of coal in question. If, therefore, there\r\nwere to be found in the ocean such a fund of this fuliginous substance\r\nas might suffice for the formation of bituminous strata, no difficulty\r\nwould be left in explaining the original of fossil coal. But tho'\r\nsufficient quantity of this fuliginous matter might not be found for the\r\nexplanation of natural appearances, yet there cannot be a doubt that\r\nmore or less of this matter must be produced in the mineral operations\r\nof the globe, and be found precisely in that place where it is required\r\nfor the forming of those strata of coal.\r\n\r\nIn order to conceive this, we are to consider, that there are actually\r\ngreat quantities of coal strata in a charred state, which indicates\r\nthat all their more volatile oleaginous or fuliginous matter had been\r\nseparated by force of subterranean heat; and, we are to suppose that\r\nthis had been transacted at the bottom of the ocean: Consequently, a\r\nsubtile oleaginous, bituminous, or fuliginous substance, must have been\r\ndiffused in that ocean; and this bituminous matter would be employed in\r\nforming other strata, which were then deposited at the bottom of the\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nBut besides this quantity of bituminous matter which is necessarily\r\nformed in the mineral operations of the earth, and with regard to the\r\nquantity of which we can never form a proper estimate, there must enter\r\ninto this same calculation all the fuliginous matter that is formed in\r\nburning bodies upon the surface of this earth. This bituminous matter of\r\nsmoke is first delivered into the atmosphere, but ultimately it must\r\nbe settled at the bottom of the sea. Hence though, compared with the\r\nquantity that we think required, each revolution of the globe produces\r\nbut a little in our estimation, yet the progress of time, in reforming\r\nworlds, may produce all that is necessary in the formation of our\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nThere now remains to explain the other way in which bituminous matter\r\nmay be obtained from vegetable bodies, that is, by means of water. For\r\nthis purpose we must begin with a part of natural history that will\r\nthrow some light upon the subject.\r\n\r\nAll the rivers in Scotland run into the sea tinged with a brown\r\nsubstance; this is most evident in some of them after a flood, and while\r\nyet the river is swelled; but, in travelling to the north of Scotland\r\nin the summer season, without any rain, I saw all the rivers, without\r\nexception, of a brown colour, compared with a river of more clear water.\r\nThis colour proceeds from the moss water, as it is called, which runs\r\ninto the rivers, or the infusion of that vegetable substance which\r\nforms combustible turf, called peat. Now, this moss water leaves, upon\r\nevaporation, a bituminous substance, which very much resembles fossil\r\ncoal. Therefore, in order to employ this vegetable infusion, delivered\r\ninto the ocean for the purpose of forming bituminous strata at its\r\nbottom, it is only required to make this bituminous matter separate and\r\nsubside.\r\n\r\nIf now we consider the immense quantity of inflammable vegetable\r\nsubstance, dissolved in water, that is carried into the sea by all the\r\nrivers of the earth, and the indefinite space of time during which those\r\nrivers have been pouring in that oily matter into the sea; and if we\r\nconsider, that the continual action of the sun and atmosphere upon this\r\noily substance tends, by inspissation, to make it more and more dense or\r\nbituminous, we cannot hesitate in supposing a continual separation\r\nof this bituminous matter or inspissated oil from the water, and\r\na precipitation of it to the bottom of the sea. This argument is\r\ncorroborated by considering, that, if it were otherwise, the water of\r\nthe sea must have, during the immense time that rivers are proved\r\nto have run, be strongly impregnated with that oily or bituminous\r\nsubstance; but this does not appear; therefore we are to conclude, that\r\nthere must be the means of separating that substance from the water in\r\nwhich it had been dissolved.\r\n\r\nIf there is thus, from the continual perishing of animal and vegetable\r\nbodies upon the surface of this earth and in the sea, a certain supply\r\nof oily or bituminous matter given to the ocean, then, however small a\r\nportion of this shall be supposed the whole oily or inflammable matter\r\nproduced upon the surface of the earth, or however long time it may\r\nrequire for thus producing a stratum or considerable body of coal,\r\nwe must still see in this a source of the materials proper for the\r\nproduction of that species of strata in the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nWe have now considered the proper materials of which pure fossil coal\r\nis chiefly formed; we have at present to consider what should be the\r\nappearances of such a substance as this collected at the bottom of the\r\nsea, and condensed or consolidated by compression and by heat. We should\r\nthus have a body of a most uniform structure, black, breaking with a\r\npolished surface, and more or less fusible in the fire, or burning with\r\nmore or less smoke and flame, in proportion as it should be distilled\r\nor inspissated, less or more, by subterranean heat. But this is the\r\ndescription of our purest fossil coals, which burn in giving the\r\ngreatest quantity of heat, and leave the smallest quantity of ashes.\r\n\r\nIn order to form another regular species of coal, let us suppose that,\r\nalong with the bituminous substance now considered, there shall be\r\nfloating in the water of the ocean a subtile earthy substance, and that\r\nthese two different substances shall subside together in an uniform\r\nmanner, to produce a stratum which shall be covered with immense weight,\r\ncompressed, condensed, and consolidated as before, we should thus have\r\nproduced a most homogeneous or uniform body to appearance, but not so\r\nin reality. The mixture of heterogeneous matter, in this case, is too\r\nminute to be discovered simply by inspection; it must require deep\r\nreflection upon the subject, with the help of chemical analysis,\r\nto understand the constitution of this body, and judge of all the\r\ncircumstances or particulars in which it differs from the former. It is\r\nworth while to examine this subject with some attention, as it will give\r\nthe most instructive view of the composition of bituminous strata, both\r\nthose which are not considered as coal, and also the different species\r\nof that mineral body.\r\n\r\nIn the first place then, if the mixture of those two different\r\nsubstances had been sufficiently perfect, and the precipitation uniform,\r\nthe solid body of coal resulting from this mixture, would not only\r\nappear homogeneous, but might break equally or regularly in all\r\ndirections; but the fracture of this coal must visibly differ from the\r\nformer, so far as the fracture of this heterogeneous coal cannot have\r\nthe polished surface of the pure bituminous body; for, the earthy matter\r\nthat is interposed among the bituminous particles must affect the\r\nfracture in preventing its surface from being perfectly smooth. This\r\nimperfect plane of the fracture may be improved by polishing; in which\r\ncase the body might be sufficiently smooth to have an agreeable polish;\r\nbut it cannot have a perfect polish like a homogeneous body, or appear\r\nwith that glassy surface which is naturally in the fracture of the pure\r\nbituminous coal.\r\n\r\nBut this is also a perfect description of that species of coal which is\r\ncalled in England Kennel coal, and in Scotland Parrot coal. It is so\r\nuniform in its substance that it is capable of being formed on the\r\nturning loom; and it receives a certain degree of polish, resembling\r\nbodies of jet.\r\n\r\nThus, we have a species of coal in which we shall find but a small\r\ndegree of fusibility, although it may not be charred in any degree.\r\nSuch an infusible coal may therefore contain a great deal of aqueous\r\nsubstance, and volatile oily matter; consequently may burn with smoke\r\nand flame. But this same species of coal may also occasionally be\r\ncharred more or less by the operation of subterranean heat; and, in\r\nthat case, we should have a variety of coal which could only be\r\ndistinguished, from a similar state of pure bituminous coal, by the\r\nashes which they leave in burning. At least, this must be the case, when\r\nboth species are, by sufficient distillation, reduced to the state of\r\nwhat may be properly termed a chemical coal.\r\n\r\nBut in the natural state of its composition, we find those strata of\r\nkennel or parrot coal, possessing a peculiar property, which deserves to\r\nbe considered, as still throwing more light upon the subject.\r\n\r\nWe have been representing these strata of coal as homogeneous to\r\nappearance, and as breaking indifferently in all directions; this last,\r\nperhaps, is not so accurate; for they would seem to break chiefly into\r\ntwo directions, that is, either parallel or perpendicular to the bed.\r\nThus we have this coal commonly in rectangular pieces, in which it\r\nis extremely difficult to distinguish the direction of the bed, or\r\nstratification of the mass. By an expert eye, however, this may be in\r\ngeneral, or at least sometimes, distinguished, and then, by knowing\r\nthe habit of the coal in burning, a person perfectly ignorant of the\r\nphilosophy of the matter may exhibit a wonderful sagacity, or even of\r\npower over future events, in applying this body to fire; for, at his\r\npleasure, and unknown to those who are not in the secret; he may\r\napparently, in equal circumstances, make this coal either kindle\r\nquietly, or with violent cracking and explosions, throwing its splinters\r\nat a distance.\r\n\r\nThe explanation lies in this, that, though the rectangular mass of coal\r\nappears extremely uniform in its structure, it is truly a stratified\r\nmass; it is therefore affected, by the sudden approach of fire in a very\r\ndifferent manner, according as the edge of the stratum, which is seen in\r\nfour of the sides of this supposed cube, shall be applied to the fire,\r\nor the other two sides, which are in the line of the stratum, or\r\nparallel to the bed of coal. The reason of this phenomenon now remains\r\nto be considered.\r\n\r\nWhen the edge of the coal is exposed to the fire, the stratification of\r\nthe coal is opened gradually by the heat and expanding vapours, as a\r\npiece of wood, of a similar shape, would be by means of wedges placed in\r\nthe end way of the timber. The coal then kindles quietly, and quickly\r\nflames, while the mass of this bituminous schistus is opening like the\r\nleaves of a book, and thus exhibits an appearance in burning extremely\r\nlike wood. But let the fire be applied to the middle of the bed, instead\r\nof the edge of the leaves, and we shall see a very different appearance;\r\nfor here the expanded aqueous vapours, confined between the _laminae_,\r\nform explosions, in throwing off splinters from the kindling mass; and\r\nthis mass of coal takes fire with much noise and disturbance.\r\n\r\nThe ashes of this coal may be determined as to quality, being in general\r\na subtile white earth; but, as to quantity, the measure of that earth\r\nproduces an indefinite variety in this species of coal; for, from the\r\nkennel or parrot coal, which is valuable for its burning with much\r\nflame, to that black schistus which our masons use in drawing upon\r\nstone, and which, though combustible in some degree, is not thought to\r\nbe a coal, there is a perfect gradation, in which coal may be found with\r\nevery proportion of this earthy alloy.\r\n\r\nAmong the lowest species of this combustible schistus are those\r\nargillaceous strata in Yorkshire from whence they procure alum in\r\nburning great heaps of this stone, which also contains sulphur, to\r\nimpregnate the aluminous earth with its acid. We have also, in this\r\ncountry, strata which differ from those aluminous schisti only in the\r\nnature of the earth, with which the bituminous sediment is mixed. In\r\nthe strata now considered, the earth, precipitated with the bituminous\r\nmatter, being calcareous, has produced a limestone, which, after burning\r\nespecially, is perfectly fissile.\r\n\r\nTherefore, with regard to the composition of mineral coal, the theory\r\nis this. That inflammable, vegetable, and animal substances, in a\r\nsubtilised state, had subsided in the sea, being mixed more or less with\r\nargillaceous, calcareous, and other earthy substances in an impalpable\r\nstate. Now, the chemical analysis of fossil coal justifies that theory;\r\nfor, in the distillation of the inflammable or oily coal, we procure\r\nvolatile alkali, as might be naturally expected.\r\n\r\nThus we have considered fossil coal as various, both in its state and\r\ncomposition; we have described coal which is of the purest composition,\r\nas well as that which is most impure or earthy; and we have shown that\r\nthere is a gradation, from the most bituminous state in which those\r\nstrata had been formed in being deposited at the bottom of the sea,\r\nto the most perfect state of a chemical coal, to which they have been\r\nbrought by the operation of subterranean fire or heat.\r\n\r\nWe have been hitherto considering fossil coal as formed of the\r\nimpalpable parts of inflammable bodies, united together by pressure, and\r\nmade to approach in various degrees to the nature of a chemical coal,\r\nby means of subterranean heat; because, from the examination of those\r\nstrata, many of them have evidently been formed in this manner.\r\nBut vegetable bodies macerated in water, and then consolidated by\r\ncompression, form a substance of the same kind, almost undistinguishable\r\nfrom some species of fossil coal. We have an example of this in our turf\r\npits or peat mosses; when this vegetable substance has been compressed\r\nunder a great load of earth, which sometimes happens, it is much\r\nconsolidated, and hardens, by drying, into a black body, not afterwards\r\ndilutable or penetrated by water, and almost undistinguishable in\r\nburning from mineralised bodies of the same kind.\r\n\r\nAlso, when fossil wood has been condensed by compression and changed by\r\nthe operation of heat, as it is frequently found in argillaceous strata,\r\nparticularly in the aluminous rock upon the coast of Yorkshire, it\r\nbecomes a jet almost undistinguishable from some species of fossil coal.\r\n\r\nThere cannot therefore be a doubt, that if this vegetable substance,\r\nwhich is formed by the collection of wood and plants in water upon the\r\nsurface of the earth, were to be found in the place of fossil coal, and\r\nto undergo the mineral operations of the globe, it must at least augment\r\nthe quantity of those strata, though it should not form distinct strata\r\nby itself.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be thought that vegetable bodies and their impalpable\r\nparts are things too far distant in the scale of magnitude to be\r\nsupposed as subsiding together in the ocean; and this would certainly be\r\na just observation with regard to any other species of bodies: But the\r\nnature of vegetable bodies is to be floatant in water; so that we may\r\nsuppose them carried at any distance from the shore; consequently, the\r\nsize of the body here makes no difference with regard to the place or\r\norder in which these are to be deposited.\r\n\r\nThe examination of fossil coal fully confirms those reasonable\r\nsuppositions. For, _first_, The strata that attend coal, whether the\r\nsandstone or the argillaceous strata, commonly, almost universally,\r\nabound with the most distinct evidence of vegetable substances; this\r\nis the impressions of plants which are found in their composition.\r\n_Secondly_, There is much fossil coal, particularly that termed in\r\nEngland clod coal, and employed in the iron foundry, that shows\r\nabundance of vegetable bodies in its composition. The strata of this\r\ncoal have many horizontal interstices, at which the more solid shining\r\ncoal is easily separated; here the fibrous structure of the compressed\r\nvegetable bodies is extremely visible; and thus no manner of doubt\r\nremains, that at least a part of this coal had been composed of the\r\nvegetable bodies themselves, whatever may have been the origin of the\r\nmore compact parts where nothing is to be distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe state in which we often find fossil wood in strata gives reason to\r\nconclude that this body of vegetable production, in its condensed state,\r\nis in appearance undistinguishable from fossil coal, and may be also in\r\ngreat quantity; as, for example, the Bovey coal in Devonshire.\r\n\r\nThus the strata of fossil coal would appear to be formed by the\r\nsubsidence of inflammable matter of every species at the bottom of the\r\nsea, in places distant from the shore, or where there had been much\r\nrepose, and where the lightest and most floatant bodies have been\r\ndeposited together. This is confirmed in examining those bodies of\r\nfossil coal; for, though there are often found beds of sand-stone\r\nimmediately above and below the stratum of the coal, we do not find any\r\nsand mixed in the strata of the coal itself.\r\n\r\nHaving found the composition of coal to be various, but all included\r\nwithin certain rules which have been investigated, we may perceive in\r\nthis an explanation of that diversity which is often observed among the\r\nvarious strata of one bed of coal. Even the most opposite species of\r\ncomposition may be found in the thickness of one bed, although of very\r\nlittle depth, that is to say, the purest bituminous coal may, in the\r\nsame bed, be conjoined with that which is most earthy.\r\n\r\nFossil coal is commonly alternated with regular sand-stone and\r\nargillaceous strata; but these are very different bodies; therefore,\r\nit may perhaps be inquired how such different substances came to be\r\ndeposited in the same place of the ocean. The answer to this is easy; we\r\ndo not pretend to trace things from their original to the place in which\r\nthey had been ultimately deposited at the bottom of the sea. It is\r\nenough that we find the substance of which we treat delivered into\r\nthe sea, and regularly deposited at the bottom, after having been\r\ntransported by the currents of the ocean. Now the currents of the ocean,\r\nhowever regular they may be for a certain period of time, and however\r\nlong this period may be protracted, naturally change; and then the\r\ncurrents, which had given birth to one species of stratum in one place,\r\nwill carry it to another; and the sediment which the moment before\r\nhad formed a coal stratum, or a bed of that bituminous matter, may\r\nbe succeeded either with the sediment of an argillaceous stratum, or\r\ncovered over with a bed of sand, brought by the changed current of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nWe have now considered all the appearances of coal strata, so far as\r\nthese depend upon the materials, and their original collection. But,\r\nas those bituminous strata have been changed in their substance by the\r\noperation of subterranean heat and inspissation, we are now to look for\r\nthe necessary consequences of this change in the body of the stratum;\r\nand also for other mineral operations common to fossil coal with\r\nconsolidated strata of whatever species.\r\n\r\nIf coal, like other mineral strata, have been inspissated and\r\nconsolidated by subterranean heat, we should find them traversed with\r\nveins and fissures; and, if the matter found in those veins and fissures\r\ncorresponds to that found in similar places of other strata, every\r\nconfirmation will be hence given to the theory that can be expected from\r\nthe consideration of those bituminous strata. But this is the case; we\r\nfind those fissures filled both with calcareous, gypseous, and pyritous\r\nsubstances. Therefore, we have reason to conclude, that the strata of\r\nfossil coal, like every other indurated or consolidated body in the\r\nearth, has been produced, _first_, by means of water preparing and\r\ncollecting materials proper for the construction of land; and,\r\n_secondly_, by the operation of internal fire or subterranean heat\r\nmelting and thus consolidating every known substance of the globe.\r\n\r\nNot only are those sparry and pyritous substances, which are more\r\nnatural to coal strata, found forming veins traversing those strata in\r\nvarious directions, but also every other mineral vein may occasionally\r\nbe found pervading coal mines, or traversing bituminous strata. Gold,\r\nsilver, copper, lead, calamine, have all, in this manner, been found in\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nThere remains now only to consider those bituminous strata of fossil\r\ncoal in relation to that change of situation which has happened more\r\nor less to every stratum which we examine; but which is so much better\r\nknown in those of coal, by having, from their great utility in the arts\r\nof life, become a subject for mining, and thus been traced in the earth\r\nat great expense, and for a long extent.\r\n\r\nCoal strata, which had been originally in a horizontal position, are now\r\nfound sometimes standing in an erect posture, even almost perpendicular\r\nto the plane in which they had been formed. Miners therefore distinguish\r\ncoal strata according as they deem them to approach to the one or other\r\nof those two extremes, in terming them either flat or edge seams or\r\nveins. Thus, it will appear, that every possible change from the\r\noriginal position of those strata may have happened, and are daily found\r\nfrom our experience in those mines.\r\n\r\nBut besides the changed position of those strata, in departing from the\r\nhorizontal line or flat position in which they had been formed, there is\r\nanother remarkable change, termed by miners a _trouble_ in the coal. The\r\nconsideration of this change will further illustrate the operations of\r\nnature in placing that which had been at the bottom of the sea above its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nStrata, that are in one place regularly inclined, may be found bended,\r\nor irregularly inclined, in following their course. Here then is a\r\nsource of irregularity which often materially effects the estimates\r\nof miners, judging from what they see, of those parts which are to be\r\nexplored; and this is an accident which they frequently experience.\r\n\r\nBut, without any change in the general direction of the stratum, miners\r\noften find their coal broke off abruptly, those two parts being placed\r\nupon a higher and lower situation in respect to each other, if flat\r\nbeds, or separated laterally if they are edge seams. This is by miners\r\ntermed a _slip, hitch_, or _dyke_.\r\n\r\nThese irregularities may either be attended with an injected body of\r\nsubterraneous lava or basaltes, here termed whin-stone, or they may not\r\nbe attended, at least apparently, _i.e._ immediately, with any such\r\naccident. But experienced miners know, that, in approaching to any of\r\nthose injected masses of stone, which are so frequent in this country,\r\ntheir coal is more and more subject to be troubled.\r\n\r\nAs there is, in this country of Scotland, two different species of\r\nmountains or hills, one composed both in matter and manner exactly\r\nsimilar to the Alps of Switzerland, the other of whin-stone, basaltic\r\nrock, or subterraneous lava; and as the fossil coal, argillaceous and\r\nsand-stone strata, are found variously connected with those hills,\r\nnothing can tend more to give a proper understanding, with regard to the\r\nconstruction of the land in general, of the globe than a view of those\r\ndifferent bodies, which are here found much mixed together in a little\r\nspace of country, thus exhibiting, as it were in miniature, what may be\r\nfound in other parts of the world, upon a larger scale, but not upon any\r\nother principle. I will therefore endeavour to give a short description\r\nof the mineral state of this country with regard to coal, so far as my\r\nexperience and memory will serve.\r\n\r\nThis country might very properly be considered as consisting of primary\r\nand secondary mountains; not as supposing the primary mountains original\r\nand inexplicable in their formation, any more than those of the latest\r\nproduction, but as considering the one to be later in point of time, or\r\nposterior in the progress of things. The first are those which commonly\r\nform the alpine countries, consisting of various schisti, of quartzy\r\nstone, and granites. The second, again, are the whinstone or basaltic\r\nhills scattered up and down the low country, and evidently posterior to\r\nthe strata of that country, which they break, elevate, and displace.\r\n\r\nThus there are in this country, as well as every where else, three\r\nthings to be distinguished; first, the alpine or elevated country;\r\nsecondly, the flat or low country; and, thirdly, that which has been of\r\nposterior formation to the strata which it traverses, in whatever shape\r\nor quality; whether as a mountain, or only as a vein; whether as a\r\nbasaltes, a porphyry, or a granite, or only as a metal, a siliceous\r\nsubstance, or a spar.\r\n\r\nThose three things which are here distinguished do not differ with\r\nregard to the chemical character of their substances; for, in each of\r\nthese, every different substance is to be found, more or less; and it\r\nis not in being composed of materials peculiar to itself, that makes an\r\nalpine country be distinguished from a flat country; it is chiefly in\r\nthe changes which the strata of the alpine country have been made to\r\nundergo, posterior to their original collection, that the rocks of the\r\nalpine country differ from those of the flat country.\r\n\r\nBut the observation that is most to the purpose of the present subject\r\nof bituminous strata, is this; it is chiefly in the strata of the flat\r\ncountry that fossil coal are found; there are none that I know of in\r\nall the alpine countries of Scotland; and it is always among the strata\r\npeculiar to the flat country that fossil coal is found. Now, this\r\nappearance cannot be explained by saying that the materials of mineral\r\ncoal had not existed in the world while those primary strata were formed\r\nin the sea. I have already shown, (chap. 4.) that there had been the\r\nsame system of a world, producing plants, and thus maintaining animals,\r\nwhile the primary strata were formed in the sea; I have even adduced an\r\nexample of coal strata among those primary schisti, although this be an\r\nextremely rare occurrence: Consequently, we are under the necessity of\r\nlooking out for some other cause.\r\n\r\nIf the changes which have been evidently superinduced in the strata of\r\nalpine countries arise from the repeated operations of subterranean\r\nfire, or to the extreme degree in which those strata have been affected\r\nby this consolidating and elevating cause, it will be natural to suppose\r\nthat the bituminous or combustible part among those stratifications, may\r\nhave been mostly consumed upon some occasion during those various and\r\nlong continued operations; whereas, in the flat beds of the low country,\r\nalthough there is the most perfect evidence for the exertion of heat in\r\nthe consolidation of those strata, the general quantity of this has been\r\na little thing, compared with the universal manifestation of this cause\r\nin the operations of the alpine countries, the strata of which have been\r\nso much displaced in their situations and positions.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, strata of sand-stone are found in both the alpine\r\nand flat countries of Scotland. About Leadhills, for example, there are\r\nabundance of those strata; but, in the flat country, the generality of\r\nthe sand-stone is so little changed as to appear to every enlightened\r\nnaturalist aquiform strata; whereas the most enlightened of those\r\nphilosophers will not perhaps attribute the same original to a similar\r\ncomposition in the alpine country, which is so much changed from its\r\noriginal state. It is not because there had been wanting a sufficient\r\ndegree of heat to consolidate the sand-stone in the coal country; for I\r\ncan show specimens of sand-stone almost contiguous with coal, that have\r\nbeen extremely much consolidated in this manner. But this is only a\r\nparticular stratum; and the general appearance of the sand-stone, as\r\nwell as other strata in the coal countries, is that of having been\r\nlittle affected by those subterranean operations of heat by which those\r\nbodies in the alpine country have been changed in their structure,\r\nshape, and position.\r\n\r\nIf we shall thus allow the principle of consolidation, consequently also\r\nof induration, to have been much exerted upon the strata of the alpine\r\ncountry, and but moderately or little upon those of the low country of\r\nScotland, we shall evidently see one reason, perhaps the only one, for\r\nthe lesser elevation of the one country above the level of the sea, than\r\nthe other. This is because the one resists the powers which have been\r\nemployed in leveling what has been raised from the bottom of the sea,\r\nmore than the other; consequently, we find more of the one remaining\r\nabove the level of the sea than of the other.\r\n\r\nLet us now take the map of Scotland, in order to observe the mixture of\r\nthose two different species of countries, whereof the one is generally\r\nlow and flat, the other high and mountainous; the one more or less\r\nprovided with fossil coal, the other not.\r\n\r\nFrom St Abb's Head, on the east of Scotland, to the Mull of Galloway,\r\non the west, there runs a ridge of mountains of granite, quartz, and\r\nschistus strata, which contain not coal. On each side of this ridge we\r\nfind coal countries; Northumberland, on the one side, and, on the other,\r\nthe shires of Ayr, Lanark, and the Lothians; the one is a mountainous\r\ncountry, the others are comparatively low or flat countries. Let us now\r\ndraw another alpine line from Buchan and Caithness, upon the east, to\r\nthe island of Jura, on the west; this traverses a mountainous country\r\ndestitute of coal, and, so far as I know, of any marks of marine bodies.\r\nBut, on each side of this great alpine ridge, we find the hard country\r\nskirted with one which is lower, flatter, or of a softer nature,\r\nin which coal is found, upon the one side, in the shires of Fife,\r\nClackmannan, and Stirling; and, on the other, in that hollow which runs\r\nfrom the Murray Frith south-west, in a straight line, directed upon the\r\nend of Mull, and composed, for the most part, of water very little above\r\nthe level of the sea. Here, to be sure, the coal is scarce, or not so\r\nevident; but there is coal upon the sea coast in several places of this\r\ngreat Bay betwixt Buchan and Caithness; and the lowness of the country,\r\nacross this part of the island, is almost sufficient testimony that it\r\nhad been composed of softer materials.\r\n\r\nThus the coal country of Scotland may be considered as in one band\r\nacross the island, and included in the counties of Ayr, Lanark, and all\r\nthose which border upon the Frith of Forth. Now, in all this tract of\r\ncoal and tender strata, we do not find ridges of alpine stone or primary\r\nmountains, but we find many hills of solid rock, little mountains, from\r\n500 to 1000 feet high; such as that beautiful conical hill North Berwick\r\nLaw, Torpender Law, Arthur's Seat, the Lowmands, and others of inferior\r\nnote. That is to say, the whole of this included space, both sea and\r\nland, has been invaded from below with melted masses of whin-stone,\r\nbreaking up through the natural strata of the country, and variously\r\nembossing the surface of the earth at present, when all the softer\r\nmaterials, with which those subterranean lavas had been covered, are\r\nwashed away or removed from those summits of the country. Hence there is\r\nscarcely a considerable tubercle, with which this country also abounds,\r\nthat may not be found containing a mass of whin-stone as a nucleus.\r\n\r\nBut besides those insulated masses of whinstone that form a gradation\r\nfrom a mountain to a single rock, such, for example, as that on which\r\nthe Castle of Edinburgh is built, we find immense quantities of the same\r\nbasaltic rock interjected among the natural strata, always breaking and\r\ndisordering them, but often apparently following their directions for a\r\nconsiderable space with some regularity. We also find dykes of the same\r\nsubstance bisecting the strata like perpendicular veins of rock; and, in\r\nsome places, we see the connection of these rocks of the same substance,\r\nwhich thus appear to be placed in such a different form in relation to\r\nthe strata.\r\n\r\nIt will thus appear, that the regular form, and horizontal direction of\r\nstrata throughout this country of coal, now under contemplation, has\r\nbeen broken and disordered by the eruption and interjection of those\r\nmasses of basaltic stone or subterraneous lava; and thus may be\r\nexplained not only the disorders and irregularities of coal strata, but\r\nalso the different qualities of this bituminous substance from its\r\nmore natural state to that of a perfect coal or fixed infusible and\r\ncombustible substance burning without smoke. This happens sometimes to a\r\npart of a coal stratum which approaches the whin-stone.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated the case of combustible or bituminous strata, I would\r\nask those naturalists, who adhere to the theory of infiltration and the\r\noperation of water alone, how they are to conceive those strata formed\r\nand consolidated. They must consider, that here are immense bodies of\r\nthose combustible strata, under hundreds, perhaps thousands, of fathoms\r\nof sand-stone, iron-stone, argillaceous and calcareous strata. If they\r\nare to suppose bituminous bodies collected at the bottom of the sea,\r\nthey must say from whence that bitumen had come; for, with regard to the\r\nstrata below those bituminous bodies, above them, and between them,\r\nwe see perfectly from whence had come the materials of which they are\r\nformed. They cannot say that it is from a collection of earthy matter\r\nwhich had been afterwards bituminized by infiltration; for, although\r\nwe find many of those earthy strata variously impregnated with the\r\nbituminous and coaly matter, I have shown that the earthy and the\r\nbituminous matter had subsided together; besides, there are many of\r\nthose coaly and bituminous strata in which there is no more than two or\r\nthree _per cent._ of earthy matter or ashes after burning; therefore\r\nthe strata must have been formed of bituminous matter, and not simply\r\nimpregnated with it.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this difficulty, we shall allow them to form their strata,\r\nwhich certainly is the case in great part, by the collection of\r\nvegetable bodies; then, I desire them to say, in what manner they are\r\nto consolidate those bodies. If they shall allege that it is by simple\r\npressure, How shall we conceive the numerous veins of spar and pyrites,\r\nwhich traverse those strata in all directions, to be formed in\r\nthose bodies consolidated by the compression of the superincumbent\r\nmasses?--Here is a manifest inconsistency, which proves that it could\r\nnot be. But, even were we to suppose all those difficulties to be over\r\ncome, there is still an impossibility in the way of that inconsiderate\r\ntheory, and this will appear more fully in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.--The Mineralogical Operations of the Earth illustrated from\r\nthe Theory of Fossil Coal.\r\n\r\nThere is not perhaps a greater difference among the various qualities of\r\nbodies than that which may be observed to subsist between the burning of\r\nthose two substances, that is, the inflammable bodies on the one hand,\r\nand those that are combustible on the other. I have treated of that\r\ndistinction in Dissertations upon subjects of Natural Philosophy, part\r\n3d. where I have considered the different effects of those two kinds\r\nof bodies upon the incident light; and, in a Dissertation upon the\r\nPhilosophy of Fire, etc. I have distinguished those two kinds of\r\nsubstances in relation to their emitting, in burning, the fixed light\r\nwhich had constituted a part of those inflammable and combustible\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nAll animals and vegetable bodies contain both those different chemical\r\nsubstances united; and this phlogistic composition is an essential part\r\nin every animal and vegetable substance. There are to be found in those\r\nbodies particular substances, which abound more or less with one of\r\nthose species of phlogistic matter, but never is the one species of\r\nthose burning substances to be found naturally, in animal and vegetable\r\nbodies, without being associated with the other; and it is all that the\r\nchemical art can do to separate them in a great degree upon occasion.\r\nPure ardent spirit may perhaps be considered as containing the one, and\r\nthe most perfect coal the other; the chemical principle of the one\r\nis proper carbonic matter; and of the other it is the hydrogeneous\r\nprinciple, or that of inflammable air.\r\n\r\nThus we so far understand the composition of animal and vegetable\r\nsubstances which burn or maintain our fires; we also understand the\r\nchemical analysis of those bodies, in separating the inflammable from\r\nthe combustible substance, or the volatile from the fixed matter, the\r\noil from what is the proper coal. It is by distillation or evaporation,\r\nthe effect of heat, that this separatory operation is performed; and we\r\nknow no other means by which this may be done. Therefore, wherever we\r\nfind peculiar effects of that separatory operation, we have a right to\r\ninfer the proper cause.\r\n\r\nThe subject, which we are to consider in this section, is not the\r\ncomposition of strata in those of mineral coal, but the transformation\r\nof those, which had been originally inflammable bodies, into bodies\r\nwhich are only combustible, an end which is to be attained by the\r\nseparation of their volatile or inflammable substances. In the last\r\nsection, I have shown of what materials the strata of mineral coal had\r\nbeen originally formed; these are substances containing abundance of\r\ninflammable oil or bitumen, as well as carbonic matter which is properly\r\ncombustible; and this is confirmed by the generality of those strata,\r\nwhich, though perfectly consolidated by fusion, retain still their\r\ninflammable and fusible qualities. But now the object of investigation\r\nis that mineral operation by which some of those strata, or some parts\r\nof a fusible and inflammable stratum, have been so changed as to become\r\ninfusible and only combustible.\r\n\r\nWe have now examined those strata which may be considered as either\r\nproper mineral coal, or as only a bituminous schistus; we are now to\r\nclass along with these another species of this kind of matter, which has\r\nhad a similar origin, although it may assume a different character.\r\n\r\nAccording to the common observations of mankind, the eminent quality by\r\nwhich coal is to be distinguished, is the burning of that substance,\r\nor its capacity for making a fire. Therefore, however similar in other\r\nrespects, a substance which had not that eminent quality of coal could\r\nhardly be considered as being allied to it; far less could it be\r\nsupposed, as being in every other respect the same. We are however\r\nto endeavour to show, that there are truly substances of this kind,\r\nsubstances which to common observation, having none of the properties of\r\ncoal with respect to fire, consequently, no utility for the purpose of\r\nburning, might be considered as another species of mineral, while at the\r\nsame time they are truly at bottom a composition very little different\r\nfrom those which we have considered as the most perfect coal.\r\n\r\nIt must be recollected that we have distinguished coal in general as\r\nof two different species, one perfect or proper coal, containing no\r\nperceptible quantity of either oil or phlegm; the other as burning with\r\nsmoke and flame, consequently containing both aqueous and oleaginous\r\nsubstances which it emits in distillation. It is the first of these\r\nwhich we are now to consider more particularly, in order to see the\r\nvarieties which may be found in this species of mineral substance.\r\n\r\nWhen that bituminous fossil, which is the common coal of this country,\r\nis submitted to heat it is subject to melt more or less, and emits smoke\r\nwhich is composed of water and oil. If it be thus completely distilled,\r\nit becomes a perfect coal of a porous or spongy texture. Such a\r\nsubstance as this is extremely rare among minerals; I have however found\r\nit. It is in the harbour of Ayr, where a whinstone dyke traverses the\r\ncoal strata, and includes some of that substance in the state of coals\r\nor cinder. I pointed this out many years ago to Dr Black; and lately I\r\nshowed it to Professor Playfair.\r\n\r\nBut the culm of South Wales, the Kilkenny coal of Ireland, and the blind\r\ncoal of Scotland, notwithstanding that these are a perfect coal, or\r\ncharred to a coal, have nothing of the porous construction of the\r\nspecimen which I have just now mentioned; they are perfectly solid, and\r\nbreak with a smooth shining surface like those which emit smoke and\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nHere is therefore a mineral operation in the preparation of those coals\r\nwhich we cannot imitate; and here is the clearest evidence of the\r\noperation of mineral fire or heat, although we are ignorant of the\r\nreason why some coal strata are charred, while others are not, and why,\r\nin some particular cases, the charred coal may be porous or spongy like\r\nour coals, while in general those blind coals (as they are called) are\r\nperfectly solid in their structure.\r\n\r\nBut to what I would call more particularly the attention of mineral\r\nphilosophers is this, that it is inconceivable to have this effect\r\nproduced by means of water; we might as well say that heat were to be\r\nthe cause of ice. The production of coal from vegetable bodies, in which\r\nthat phlogistic substance is originally produced, or from animal bodies\r\nwhich have it from that source, is made by heat, and by no other means,\r\nso far as we know. But, even heat alone is not sufficient to effect that\r\nend, or make a perfect coal; the phlogistic body, which is naturally\r\ncompound, consisting of both inflammable and combustible substances,\r\nmust be separated chemically, and this must be the operation of heat\r\nunder the proper circumstances for distillation or evaporation.\r\n\r\nHere is the impossibility which in the last chapter I have alleged the\r\naqueous theory has to struggle against; and here is one of the absolute\r\nproofs of the igneous theory. Not only must the aqueous part of those\r\nnatural phlogistic bodies be evaporated, in order to their becoming\r\ncoal, but the oily parts must also, by a still increased degree of heat,\r\nbe evaporated, or separated by distillation from the combustible part.\r\nHere, therefore, is evidently the operation of heat, not simply that\r\nof fusion in contradiction to the fluidity of aqueous solution, but\r\nin opposition to any effect of water, as requiring the absence or\r\nseparation of that aqueous substance.\r\n\r\nBut those natural appearances go still farther to confirm our theory,\r\nwhich, upon all occasions, considers the compression upon the bodies\r\nthat are submitted to the operation of heat, in the mineral regions, as\r\nhaving the greatest efficacy in modifying that operation. Coal strata,\r\nwhich are in the neighbourhood of each other, being of those two\r\nopposite species, the one fusible and inflammable, the other infusible\r\nand combustible, afford the clearest proof of the efficacy of\r\ncompression; for, it is evident, that the coal, which was once\r\nbituminous or fusible, cannot be charred without the distillation of\r\nthat substance; therefore, prevent the distillation by compression and\r\nthe charring operation cannot proceed, whatever should be the intensity\r\nof the heat; and then, fusion alone must be the effect upon the\r\nbituminous body. But now, as we have both those species of coal in the\r\nvicinity of each other, and even the same strata of coal part charred,\r\nwhile the rest is not, this natural appearance, so far from being a\r\nstumbling block, as it must be to the opposite theory, is most clearly\r\nexplained by the partial escape of vapours from the mineral regions, and\r\nthus confirms the theory with regard to the efficacy of compression.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to the solidity of those natural charred coals, and the want\r\nof oil, that they are so very difficult of kindling; but, when once\r\nkindled in sufficient quantity, they make a fire which is very durable.\r\nThere are even some of them which, to common observation, seem to be\r\naltogether incombustible. I have of this kind a specimen from a stratum\r\nat Stair, which shall be afterwards mentioned.\r\n\r\nM. Struve, in the Journal de Physique for January 1790, describes a\r\nmineral which he calls _plombagine charbonneuse ou hexaëdre_; and gives\r\nfor reason, _parce qu'elle ressemble extrêmement au charbon de pierre\r\nschisteux, ou d'hexaëdre_. He says farther, \"Il est très commun, dans\r\nune roche qui forme un passage entre les granits et les brèches, qu'on\r\nn'a trouvée jusqu'a présent qu'on masses roulées dans le pays de Vaud.\"\r\nHe concludes his paper thus: \"Ce fossile singulier ne paroît pas\r\nappartenir à la Suisse seule. J'ai dans ce moment devant les yeux une\r\nsubstance parfaitement semblable, si on excepte la couleur qui tient le\r\nmilieu entre le gris de fer et le rouge modéré; elle vient du pays de\r\nGotha de la Friedrischs-grube, proche d'Umneau. On le regarde comme un\r\neisenrahm uni à du charbon de pierre.\"\r\n\r\nThe specimen which I have from Stair upon the water of Ayr, so far as I\r\ncan understand, perfectly resembles this _plombagine_ of M. Struve. It\r\nconsumes very slowly in the fire, and deflagrates like plumbago with\r\nnitre. Now this comes from a regular coal stratum; and what is more\r\nremarkable, in this stratum is contained a true plumbago, Farther up the\r\ncountry, the Earl of Dumfries has also a mine containing plumbago along\r\nwith other coal strata; and though the plumbago of these two mines have\r\nnot all the softness and beauty of the mineral of the same species from\r\nCumberland, they are nevertheless perfect plumbago.\r\n\r\nI have a specimen of steatetical whinstone or basaltes from some part of\r\nCumberland, in which is contained many nodules of the most perfect and\r\nbeautiful plumbago. It is dispersed through this stone in rounded masses\r\nof all sizes from a nut to a pin's head; and many of these are mixed\r\nwith pyrites. There is therefore reason to believe that this plumbago\r\nhad been in fusion.\r\n\r\nNow, if we consider that every species of coal and every species of\r\nplumbago are equally, that is, perfectly combustible, and yield, in\r\nburning, the same volatile principles, differing only perhaps a little\r\nin the small quantity of fixed matter which remains, we shall be\r\ninclined to believe, that they have all the same origin in a vegetable\r\nsubstance; and that they are diversified by some very small composition\r\nof other matter. This being allowed, one thing is certain, that it is by\r\nthe operation of mineral fire or heat that those combustible substances,\r\nhowever composed, have been brought to their present state of coal,\r\nalthough we are ignorant of the circumstances by which their differences\r\nand their peculiar chemical and mechanical qualities have been produced.\r\n\r\nLet us resume in a few words. There is not perhaps one substance in the\r\nmineral kingdom by which the operation of subterraneous heat is, to\r\ncommon understanding, better exemplified than that of mineral coal.\r\nThose strata are evidently a deposit of inflammable substances which all\r\ncome originally from vegetable bodies. In this state of their formation,\r\nthose coal strata must all be oleagenous or bituminous. In many of them,\r\nhowever, these volatile parts are found wanting; and, the stratum is\r\nfound in the state of the most perfect coal or caput mortuum. There, is,\r\nI presume, no other means to be found by which this eminent effect could\r\nbe produced, except by distillation; and, this distillation perhaps\r\nproceeded under the restraining force of an immense compression.\r\n\r\nTo this theory it must not be objected, that all the strata of coal,\r\nwhich are found in the same place or neighbourhood, are not reduced to\r\nthat caput mortuum or perfect coaly state. The change from a bituminous\r\nto a coaly substance can only take place in proportion as the\r\ndistillation of the volatile parts is permitted. Now this distillation\r\nmust be permitted, if any passage can be procured from the inflammable\r\nbody submitted to the operation of subterraneous heat; and, one stratum\r\nof coal may find vent for the passage of those vapours, through some\r\ncrevice which is not open to another. In this way, doubtless, some of\r\nthose bodies have been inspissated or reduced to a fixed coal, while\r\nothers, at a little distance, have retained most of their volatile\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nWe cannot doubt of this distilling operation in the mineral regions,\r\nwhen we consider that in most places of the earth we find the evident\r\neffects of such distillation of oily substances in the naphta and\r\npetroleum that are constantly emitted along with water in certain\r\nsprings. These oily substances are no other than such as may be\r\nprocured, in a similar manner, from the fusible or inflammable coal\r\nstrata; we have therefore every proof of this mineral operation that the\r\nnature of things admit of. We have also sufficient evidence that those\r\nfusible and inflammable coals, which have not been distilled to a caput\r\nmortuum, had been subjected to the operation of subterraneous heat,\r\nbecause we find those fusible coals subject to be injected with pyrites,\r\nas well as the more perfect coal.\r\n\r\nIf we now consider those various appearances of mineral bodies which\r\nare thus explained by the theory of mineral fire, or exertion of\r\nsubterraneous heat, appearances which it is impossible to reconcile by\r\nany supposition of aqueous solution, or that unintelligible language\r\nof mineral infiltration which has of late prevailed, we shall be fully\r\nsatisfied, that there is a uniform system in nature of providing a power\r\nin the mineral regions, for consolidating the loose materials deposited\r\nat the bottom of the sea, and for erecting those masses of mineralized\r\nsubstances into the place of land; we shall thus be led to admire the\r\nwisdom of nature, providing for the continuation of this living world,\r\nand employing those very means by which, in a more partial view of\r\nthings, this beautiful structure of an inhabited earth seems to be\r\nnecessarily going into destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME FIRST.",
