A feeling has grown amongst us that we should “say\r\nnothing good except of the dead,” at least as regards those who differ\r\nfrom us. So has many a man gone from the world with little suspicion of\r\nthe appreciation that might have warmed him in the last chill years;\r\nmany a man sunk into the grave with the harsh echo of dishonouring words\r\nstill rumbling in his ears. It may be that our ideas, our truths, would\r\nnot suffer greatly if we could patiently endeavour to trace the\r\ncommunity of humane feeling that lies beneath the wide gulfs that often\r\nseparate us intellectually from each other.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ernst Haeckel is one of those combative figures of all time\r\nwho take misunderstanding as a part of their romantic career. If he had\r\nshut himself within the laboratory, as some of his gifted colleagues\r\ndid, all the world would honour him to-day. His vast range of biological\r\nknowledge, almost without parallel in our specialist days, fitted him\r\nfor great scientific achievements. His superb special contributions to\r\nbiology—his studies of radiolaria, sponges, medusæ, &c.—give ample\r\nevidence of it. As things are, he has, Professor Hertwig says, “written\r\nhis name in letters of light in the history of science.” He holds four\r\ngold medals for scientific research (Cothenius, Swammerdam, Darwin, and\r\nChallenger), four doctorates (Berlin, Jena, Edinburgh, and Cambridge),\r\nand about eighty diplomas from so many universities and academic bodies.\r\nBut he was one of those who cannot but look out of the windows of the\r\nlaboratory. His intense idealism, his sense of what he felt to be wrong\r\nand untrue, inflamed by incessant travel and communion with men, drove\r\nhim into the field of battle. In the din and roar of a great conflict\r\nhis name has passed on to a million lips and become the varied war-cry\r\nof fiercely contending parties. A hundred Haeckels, grotesque in their\r\nunlikeness to each other, circulate in our midst to-day.\r\n\r\nThe present work is a plain study of the personality of Haeckel and the\r\ngrowth of his ideas. The character of Haeckel was forged amid\r\ncircumstances that have largely passed away from the scientific world of\r\nour time. The features, even, of the world he has worked in of recent\r\nyears in Germany are so different from our own that no Englishman can\r\nunderstand him without sober study of his life. He has often been called\r\n“the Darwin of Germany.” The phrase is most misleading. It suggests a\r\ncomparison that is bound to end in untruth and injustice. In the same\r\nyear that Haeckel opened his Darwinian campaign in Germany he won the\r\nprize for the long jump—a record jump. It is the note of much in his\r\ncharacter. He was no quiet recluse, to shrink from opposition and hard\r\nnames, but a lusty, healthy, impetuous, intrepid youth, even when his\r\nhair had worn to grey. A story is told of how, not many years ago, the\r\nGrand Duke of Weimar playfully rallied him, in the midst of a brilliant\r\ncompany, on his belief in evolution. To the horror of the guests, he\r\nslapped the powerful noble on the shoulder, and told him to come to Jena\r\nand see the proofs of it. In his seventy-first year we find him severely\r\ncensuring his Emperor—the emperor of many fortresses—in a public lecture\r\nat Berlin.\r\n\r\nHow his vigour and his resentment arose as barrier after barrier was\r\nraised before him: how his scorn of compromise was engendered and fed:\r\nhow he accumulated mountains of knowledge in obscure, technical works\r\nbefore he formulated his sharp didactic conclusions: all this is told in\r\nthe following story. For good or ill he has won an influence in this\r\ncountry, and his story should be read. It is, in itself, one of rare and\r\nvaried interest, and it is told by one of the most brilliant penmen of\r\nmodern Germany, his former pupil, now a distinguished biologist,\r\nProfessor Wilhelm Bölsche.\r\n\r\nThe time seems to have come in England for the publication of some\r\nauthoritative picture of the great biologist and controversialist. One\r\nwork of his circulates by the hundred thousand amongst us, and has had a\r\ndeep and lasting influence on the thoughts of large classes of men. His\r\ninfluence is hardly less in France and Italy, as well as in Germany; his\r\ndoctrines have, in fact, been translated into fifteen different tongues.\r\nThe deep, sometimes bitter, controversy that they have engendered must\r\nhave led to a desire to know more of the man and his making. The\r\nattempts that have been made here and there to “construct” him from his\r\nideas and literary manner are, as the reader will see, very far removed\r\nfrom the reality. Behind all the strained inferences from doctrines,\r\nbehind all the dishonouring epithets, there is a genial, warm, deeply\r\nartistic, intensely idealist nature, sung with enthusiasm by poets who\r\nhave known him. Once, in playful scientific mood, Haeckel tried to\r\nexplain his own character in his familiar terms of heredity and\r\nenvironment. He came of a line of lawyers, straight, orderly, inexorable\r\nmen. He had lived and worked in quiet Jena, in the beautiful valley of\r\nthe Saale. But he did not speak of that larger environment—the field of\r\nbattle, stretching far away, beyond the calm Thuringian hills, to the\r\nends of Europe. We must place Haeckel’s ardent and high-minded nature in\r\nthat field, face to face with his opponents, if we would understand him.\r\n\r\nFor the supplementary chapter I have drawn freely on another\r\nbiographical sketch by one of Haeckel’s pupils, Dr. Breitenbach, and\r\nother sources. For the illustrations I am indebted chiefly to Professor\r\nHaeckel himself, and can only offer him in return this grateful effort\r\nto lift his inspiring and impressive personality above the dust and\r\ncloud of a great controversy.\r\n\r\n                                        JOSEPH McCABE.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                              EARLY YOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\n“I am wholly a child of the nineteenth century, and with its close I\r\nwould draw the line under my life’s work.” Thus does Professor Haeckel\r\nspeak of himself. There is a note of gentle resignation in the words,\r\nbut the time is coming when men will give them a different meaning.\r\nWhatever greater achievements may be wrought by a future generation in\r\nthe service of truth and human welfare, their work will be but a\r\ncontinuation of the truth of our time, as long as humanity breathes. On\r\nthe intrepid, outstanding figures of the nineteenth century will shine a\r\nlight that is peculiarly theirs, an illumination that men will dwell on\r\nfor ever—as we look back, in personal life, on the young days of love.\r\nIt was a strong love that brought our century to birth.\r\n\r\nThe soul of humanity has for four centuries been passing through a grim\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine ourselves for a moment before the noble painting by\r\nMichael Angelo in the Sistine Chapel at Rome. What art! What utter\r\nrevelation of the power of man’s mind! But, we ask, what material did\r\nthe genius of humanity choose in those days for the manifestation of its\r\ngiant power? The last judgment: the Christ descending at the blare of\r\nthe last trumpet, to reward the faithful and banish the sinner into\r\neverlasting pain: the Almighty, breathing His spirit into Adam, or\r\nmystically upbuilding Eve from the rib of the man. There was no\r\n“symbolic” intention in the picture; the deepest feeling of\r\nhundreds—nay, thousands—of years was embodied in it. The artist merely\r\ngave an imperishable external form to the most treasured truth of his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nYet, slowly and gradually, what a mighty change has come about!\r\n\r\nColumbus has sailed over the blue seas, and a new side of the earth lies\r\nin the violet haze of the dawn. Copernicus sees the ball of the earth\r\nroll round the sun through space, by force of some mysterious law.\r\nKepler dreams of the world-harmony that will replace the ever-acting\r\nDeity, and discovers at length an unsuspected regularity in the\r\nframework of the heavens. Galileo turns his new optic tube to the stars,\r\nand at once the heavens are changed, not only for the calculating,\r\nmathematical mind, but even for the eye of sense: there are jagged peaks\r\non the moon, satellites circling about Jupiter, a wilderness of stars\r\nlying across the Milky Way, spots on the sun, rings round Saturn.\r\nGiordano Bruno shatters the ancient crystalline vault of the firmament;\r\nevery “fixed star” in the Milky Way is to him a flaming sun, the pulsing\r\nheart of a whole world, in which, perchance, human hearts like ours\r\nthrob and leap on a hundred planets. The red, murderous flames of hate\r\nclose over Bruno, but they cannot dim the light of the new stars. It is\r\nin the eye and the brain of the new men that arise, and will nevermore\r\nfade from them.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century, opening amid the last glare of the\r\nmartyr-fires, quickens with a vague yearning and expectation.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century the old world breaks up. From the new stars,\r\nfrom the new world, new ideas come. On all sides is the crash and roar\r\nof conflict. Dread flames break out in the social, moral, and æsthetic\r\nlife of men. But the century ends in the birth of a greater artist than\r\nMichael Angelo.\r\n\r\nGoethe, on the morn of the nineteenth century, paints a new Sixtine\r\nChapel in his poetry. But he no longer depicts the old ideas. He speaks\r\nof God-Nature. To him God is the eternal force of the All. His thoughts\r\nturn no longer on Creation and the Last Judgment. An eternal evolution\r\nis the source of his inspiration. He regards the whole universe as a\r\nsingle, immeasurable revelation of spirit. But this spirit is the\r\nrhythmic outflow of infinite developments. It becomes Milky Way and sun\r\nand planet, blue lotus-flowers and gay butterfly. At last it takes the\r\nform of man, and reads the stars as an open book. In Homer and Goethe it\r\ndirects the style and the pen; in Michael Angelo and Raphael it guides\r\nthe pencil and the brush.\r\n\r\nAll this unfolds in Goethe, as in a vision with yet half-opened eyes.\r\n\r\nThen the nineteenth century begins. Nature is its salvation, the\r\nsalvation of its most practical, most real need. It must struggle for\r\nits existence, like any other century, but it has new and improved\r\nweapons for the struggle. All the earlier ages were but poor blunderers.\r\nThe lightning flashed on the naked savage, and he fell on his knees and\r\nprayed, powerless as he was. In the eighteenth century it dawned on\r\nmen’s minds that this might be some force of nature. The nineteenth\r\ncentury sets its foot on the neck of the demon of this force, presses\r\nhim into its service, plays with him. Its thoughts and words flash along\r\nthe lightning current, as if along new nerve-tracks, that begin to\r\ncircle the globe. Man becomes lord of the earth, from the uppermost\r\nazure down into the dark, cold abysses of the ocean, from the icy pole\r\nto the burning tropical desert. And at length man turns his thoughts\r\nupon himself.\r\n\r\nMan, his arm resting on the splendid instruments of modern research,\r\nraises his hand to his brow, and turns philosopher. He becomes at once\r\nmore bold and more modest than ever.\r\n\r\nWhat Goethe had seen in vision rises before him now in sharp, almost\r\nhard outline from his own real life-work. He has succeeded in bringing\r\nnature and its forces to his feet, because it was flesh of his flesh and\r\nblood of his blood. He is its child. A thousand tongues proclaim the\r\ntruth to him, a naïve, almost simple, revelation of reality. He digs in\r\nthe earth, and ancient bones and skulls tell him vaguely of the past.\r\nSuch once was he, devoid of civilisation, at the verge of the animal\r\nworld. He searches his frame through and through for further light.\r\nThere is the brain, where the thoughts crowd together. There is the\r\ncell, that builds up the whole body, the cell that so closely resembles\r\nthe lowest of all living things, not yet distinct enough to be either\r\nanimal or plant. Here are the forms that he successively assumes in his\r\nmother’s body, before he is born—forms that can hardly be distinguished\r\nfrom those of the animal at the same stage of development. From almost\r\ndivine heights he has sunk down to the beast, to the primitive cell—nay,\r\ndeeper still, to the elementary, force-impelled matter of the universe.\r\n\r\nBut this early picture dissolves at once in an ennobling and inspiring\r\ntruth. Nature becomes man. In this he presses once more to the heart of\r\nthe most-high. Nature is God. Goethe sang of God-Nature. The new God\r\npulses in every wave of man’s blood. In Michael Angelo’s picture God\r\nbreathes his spirit into Adam. The new Adam of the nineteenth century is\r\nGod’s spirit, in body and soul, from the very first, for he is Nature.\r\nHe needs no more. When he looks up to the shining stars, he looks into\r\nthe eyes of God and his own. He has come down from those stars like the\r\nbright dew in which they are now mirrored. He belongs to them, but they\r\nalso are in him. All-Nature: and he is a part of Nature.\r\nAll-development: and he is a phase of the development.\r\n\r\nThat is the great philosophical dream of the nineteenth-century worker.\r\nHis hand is black with labour, but his spirit is full of light, the\r\nlight of the stars and of the world.\r\n\r\nNo one can understand the greatness of a man like Ernst Haeckel who has\r\nnot learned this melody. Nature is not a flat surface: it is an ocean.\r\nWhen Columbus crossed the seas in his three frail barques long ago to\r\nseek a new world in the distant haze, he little dreamed that the gray\r\nwaters buried other new worlds a thousand yards beneath his keel—worlds\r\nof the deep-sea, into which our age has slowly dipped with its dredges.\r\nSo we in turn may run our eye over the blue surface of nature, and think\r\nof its mysterious gold-lands and spice-islands, without suspicion of all\r\nthat outspreads beneath our keel. Yet that glorious day on which\r\nColumbus found “his land” is an inspiration to us, his remote\r\ngrandchildren. The life we are going to examine will bring before us\r\nsuch a morning of discovery. Columbus went in quest of Zipangu (as he\r\ncalled Japan), and he found America. Not one of us, however gifted he\r\nbe, can be quite sure that, in leading humanity, he is not sailing into\r\nanother such heroic error. Let us say that at once to all, friends and\r\nopponents. America or Zipangu—let it be so. Perhaps any man might have\r\nfound Zipangu, while only the genius could reach America.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Gustav Freytag, who had a most happy quality for writing memoirs,\r\nwas composing his admirable _Pictures from the Past of Germany_, he\r\nsought in each period some prominent man of plain and downright\r\ncharacter, yet who had something typical of his age in his sentiments,\r\nas if the time-spirit spoke through him. In this quest he twice (in the\r\nfourth volume, for the period from the close of the eighteenth century\r\nto the Wars of Freedom) lit upon earlier members of Haeckel’s family.\r\nThe first was Haeckel’s grandfather on the mother’s side, Christoph\r\nSethe; the second was his father, Councillor Haeckel.\r\n\r\nThis simple fact shows the stuff of Haeckel’s race. The older Sethe was\r\nan important man in his time. He left to his children manuscript memoirs\r\nof his eventful life, which have, unfortunately, been only sparsely used\r\nby Freytag, though the whole deserved to be regarded as a source of\r\nhistory. The general facts in relation to him were collected by Hermann\r\nHüffer, who was not merely interested in the jurist because he was one\r\nhimself, but was brought into touch with him as a result of his\r\nbrilliant study of Heine. Sethe’s eldest son, Christian, the uncle of\r\nErnst Haeckel, is the well-known friend of Heine’s youth to whom the\r\npoet dedicated the “Fresco-sonnets” in his _Book of Songs_ and wrote the\r\nfinest of his early letters. This Christian Sethe (he died on May 31,\r\n1857, being then Provincial Director of Revenue at Stettin), was a\r\nlawyer, like his father, and the father himself came of a legal family.\r\nHaeckel’s own father, moreover, the husband of one of Christian’s\r\nsisters, was a State Councillor at the time of his death, and his elder\r\nbrother was a Provincial Councillor. Thus Haeckel’s genealogical tree\r\nspreads into the legal profession in a curiously complex way.\r\n\r\nWe naturally reflect for a moment if we could fancy Haeckel himself as a\r\nlawyer. It is hardly possible. He would at least have been a very\r\nrebellious member of the profession, and have been sadly lacking in\r\nrespect for the venerable traditions and powdered wigs of the\r\ncourt—assuming, of course (which a mere layman has no right to\r\nquestion), that there ought still to be such traditions and costumes in\r\nthe profession. In his vigorous _Riddle of the Universe_ he has, from\r\nhis scientific point of view, brought strictures against the legal\r\nprofession that leave nothing to be desired in the way of candour, when\r\nwe recollect the long tradition of his family. In its lingering in the\r\nrear of the progress of the times the whole science of law seemed to him\r\nto be a “riddle of the universe.” The jurist is apt to be respected as\r\nan embodiment of our highest culture. In reality that is not the case.\r\nThe distinctive object of his concern, man and his soul, is only\r\nsuperficially studied in the preparation for the law, and so we still\r\nfind amongst jurists the most extraordinary views as to the freedom of\r\nthe will, responsibility, and so on. “Most of our legal students pay no\r\nattention to anthropology, psychology, and evolution, the first\r\nrequisites for a correct appreciation of human nature. They ‘have no\r\ntime’ for it. It is unfortunately all absorbed in a profound study of\r\nbeer and wine and the ‘noble art’ of fencing; and the rest of their\r\nvaluable time is taken up in learning some hundreds of paragraphs from\r\nthe books of law, the knowledge of which is supposed to qualify the\r\njurist to fill any position whatever in the State.”\r\n\r\nThe student of psychology, however, cannot fail to see that the\r\ndisposition that led so many members of Haeckel’s family into the legal\r\nprofession was also developed in himself to some extent. There is\r\nperhaps no other scientist of his time with such an imperious craving\r\nfor clearness, for clean lines and systematic arrangement. At least in\r\nthe whole of the Darwinian period no other has made so great an effort\r\nto convert the scattered flight of phenomena in the realm of life into\r\nthe even course of so many fixed “laws.” In many of his writings this\r\ntendency to formulate laws is so pronounced that the layman\r\ninstinctively has an impression of dogmatism on the part of the author.\r\nThis has been grossly misunderstood, and made to play an important part\r\nin the controversial work of his opponents. The truth is that this sharp\r\noutlook and pronounced tendency to formulate clear and unambiguous\r\n“laws” in the animal and plant worlds is a matter of temperament as much\r\nas of judgment. It is very possible that we have here an hereditary\r\ntrait, an innate aversion for disorder and confusion—for a thoughtless\r\nrushing ahead without clear ideas and plan. The trait was the more\r\nimportant and helpful as a man of Haeckel’s type was sure to be one of\r\nthe most active revolutionaries in his science, even apart from\r\nDarwinian ideas. It would be difficult to find another reformer in any\r\ngreat province of thought who, immediately after effecting a complete\r\noverthrow of the older ideas, has hastened so quickly to build up the\r\nnew, to devise a nomenclature and a classification down to the smallest\r\ndetails, and hand on at once to his successors a splendid order once\r\nmore. Zoology, which seemed to crumble into chaos after Darwin’s victory\r\nand the collapse of the old framework, came out of Haeckel’s hands,\r\nafter barely two years’ work, in the shape of a new and graceful\r\nDarwinistic structure—not, indeed, perfect and finally completed, but\r\nentirely habitable for the young generation. They could add new stones\r\nas they thought fit, or pierce new windows, and so on; but at all events\r\nthe chaos was terminated at a critical moment by this iron man of order.\r\nI will only add, to complete the picture, that one of the three\r\ndoctorates that Haeckel holds to-day is that of law (an honorary\r\ndegree), in addition to his qualifications in philosophy and medicine.\r\nHe now only lacks the theological degree, but I fear that he will\r\nneither take the trouble to secure it nor have it conferred on him as an\r\nhonorary distinction for his merit in that department.\r\n\r\nThe Sethes and Haeckels of the earlier generation were not merely\r\nzealous jurists, but also characteristic figures of Napoleonic and\r\npost-Napoleonic Prussia. Christoph Sethe, the patriarch of the maternal\r\nline, was Privy Councillor of the Prussian Government at Cleve at the\r\nbeginning of the last decade of the eighteenth century, though he was\r\nthen young. When the French occupied the country he accompanied the\r\nGovernment to Münster, in 1802, which had become a Prussian town. But\r\nthe stalwart German was pursued even there by the detested Napoleonists.\r\nHe was sent to Düsseldorf as General Procurator in 1808, and came into\r\ndangerous conflict with the French authorities shortly before the\r\nEmperor’s fall. The mobilisation of the troops for the campaign of 1812\r\nhad led to a disturbance amongst the workers. Sethe’s sense of\r\npatriotism and justice was affronted by the arbitrary proceedings of the\r\nFrench. He was summoned to give an account at Paris, the chief object\r\nbeing to retain him—the most powerful official in the Rhine district and\r\nnot a very safe man—as a hostage during the crisis. It was at Paris that\r\nhe made the finest phrase of his life. Roederer, the minister, tried to\r\nintimidate him with the threat that the Emperor might have a dangerous\r\nman like him shot at any moment. “You will have to shoot the law first,”\r\nreplied Sethe. We are often reminded of this saying in the biography of\r\nSethe’s grandson. If Haeckel had been burned at the stake like Giordano\r\nBruno, he would have thought of nothing but the “law”—the law of truth\r\nand freedom that they would burn with him.\r\n\r\nChristoph Sethe continued to play an important part in the service of\r\nPrussia, to which, of course, he returned, together with the Rhinelands,\r\nafter Napoleon’s fall. He was destined to live through the terrible\r\nreaction under Frederic William the Third, and the fiery outburst under\r\nhis successor. After the early death of his wife their youngest\r\ndaughter, Bertha, managed his house and large family.\r\n\r\nShe lived until her death (April 1, 1904) in her quiet, unpretentious\r\nhome in one of the large empty streets behind the Tiergarten at Berlin,\r\nreaching the age of ninety-two, but never losing her freshness of mind\r\nand memory. In my many happy talks with the aged lady the succeeding\r\nperiods seemed to melt together. The small, old furniture and the\r\nancient, ever-ticking clock made me forget, in dreamy twilight hours,\r\nthat the red glare in the sky above the houses beyond, that faintly lit\r\nup the old-time room, was the reflection from the twentieth century of\r\nthe electric flames that flashed on the great modern city. On the table\r\nlay the latest part of Haeckel’s (her nephew) fine illustrated work for\r\nartistically minded scientists and scientifically minded artists—the\r\n_Art-forms in Nature_. The dear old lady spoke with pride of her\r\nknowledge of the “radiolaria,” the mysterious unicellular\r\nocean-dwellers, described in Haeckel’s splendid monograph, the flinty\r\nshells of which are amongst the finest artistic treasures of nature. She\r\ncalled them the “dear radiolaria” with all the tenderness of the\r\nemotional man of science who had felt a sort of psychic relation, a\r\nliving affinity, to the tiny microscopic strangers he had been the first\r\nto arrange and describe in their thousands. Smiling, with quiet pride,\r\nshe told me how her nephew visited her, when he came to Berlin; how,\r\nwith the unassuming ways of this sound stock, he chose to sleep in the\r\nclothes-drying loft; how he invited his friends to come and hear of his\r\nvoyages and work, bringing thirty of them to share a single dish of\r\nherring-salad in his naïve way, and how, as they continued to pour in,\r\nhe made seats for them of boards and tubs, and fed them with his\r\nwonderful genius for anecdote so that none went away fasting. She dwelt\r\nwith entire satisfaction on the last, the “zoological” phase, of the\r\nHaeckel-Sethe house. Yet it all blended softly with the old and the past\r\nof nearly a century ago. Over the patriarchal furniture hung the oil\r\npainting of Christoph Sethe, with the large Roman nose that runs through\r\nthe family down to Ernst Haeckel himself, and gives the chief feature to\r\nhis otherwise soft profile. Under a glass shade, in the old fashion of\r\nour grandfathers that we perhaps do not sufficiently appreciate, was a\r\nfine bust of Schleiermacher. He was a friend of the Sethes. Bertha Sethe\r\nwas confirmed by him. He died four days before Ernst Haeckel was born,\r\non February 12, 1834. The sister came from the grave to attend the\r\nmother of the new-born child. A little fact of that character seems to\r\npour out a broad stream of light. The religious sense was strong in the\r\nSethes, but it was not of the rigid conventional character. It came from\r\nthe depths of human destinies, of individual experience. In those depths\r\nit is always found associated with that other fundamental quality of\r\nhuman experience and inner life—a zeal for the truth. Schleiermacher,\r\nthe Good, had endeavoured within the limits of his time (if not of our\r\ntime) to erect a new and firmer Christendom. Darwinism might very well\r\nhave adjusted itself to this new Christendom, that needed no record of\r\nmiracles from disputed historical works to support it, but sought the\r\nholiest ideal prophetically in the symbolic conception and the\r\ndevelopment of the true, the good, and the beautiful. Had Schleiermacher\r\nread the _Natural History of Creation_, or later theologians shared his\r\ntemper, one wonders how much exaggeration and bitterness might have been\r\nspared on either side. But religion was not prepared to dissociate\r\nitself from “the Church,” and with the Church there could be no\r\ncompromise. Thus one’s thoughts travelled from the radiolaria in\r\nHaeckel’s latest publication and the old bust of Schleiermacher, which\r\nwas protected by its glass shade, in this home of old-world piety, from\r\nthe wicked flies of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nAn elder sister of Bertha Sethe and daughter of the old Christoph Sethe\r\nhad married the much older lawyer, Karl Haeckel, in the twenties. The\r\nfirst-fruit of this marriage was Ernst Haeckel’s elder brother, the\r\nProvincial Councillor Haeckel who died a few years ago, a high-minded\r\nand sensitive man. He remained throughout life faithful to the strict\r\ntraditional forms of religious experience, in spite of all his\r\nadmiration for his gifted zoological brother.\r\n\r\nThe second and last child did not appear until ten years later. Ernst\r\nHaeckel was born on the 16th of February, 1834, shortly after the death\r\nof Schleiermacher, as I have explained. Most of what I know of his\r\nearliest years was told me by his venerable aunt Bertha.\r\n\r\nHis father died long ago, in 1871. Gustav Freytag has pointed out how\r\neagerly he drank in the morning air of the dawning freedom before 1813.\r\nFor many years he was at a later date a very close friend of Gneisenau.\r\nHe was an earnest, conscientious, upright man, with no particular\r\nartistic arabesques to his life, and at the same time no errors. The\r\nvictories of 1870 lit up the red sunset of his days. He was one of those\r\nhappy folk who thought that _all_ was accomplished in the great\r\nachievements of those days, and had little suspicion of what was still\r\nto come. The mother survived him for many years. Her son’s _Indian\r\nTravels_ was dedicated to her on her eighty-fourth birthday, November\r\n22, 1882. The dedication ran: “Thou it was who from early childhood\r\nfostered in me a sense for the infinite beauties of nature: thou hast\r\never watched my changeful career with all the ceaseless care and thought\r\nthat we compress in the one phrase—a mother’s love.”\r\n\r\nErnst Haeckel was born at Potsdam, but in the same year the father was\r\ntransferred to Merseburg, where the child was brought up. It was not his\r\ndestiny to be a child of Berlin. Saxony remained essentially his home in\r\nmany respects. We can always see in him something of this home that\r\nlooks down on its children from its great green hills. The cold lines of\r\nthe streets of the metropolis and the melancholy of the Brandenburg\r\npine-forests cannot be traced in him. In later years Berlin assumed more\r\nand more in his thoughts the shape of an antipodal city. His works are\r\nfull of the sharpest strictures on Berlin science. It was at an earlier\r\ndate the city of Ehrenberg and Reichert, whom he did not love; later it\r\nwas associated with Du Bois-Reymond and Virchow, who gradually became\r\nhis bitterest opponents. But he detested it generally as the home of\r\nPrivy Councillors, of science in the Procrustean bed of official\r\nsupervision. When he compared what he himself had done at Jena with the\r\nslenderest possible appliances, and what, in his judgment, had been done\r\nby the heads of the Berlin schools in their princely institutes, he\r\nwould humorously—though it has been taken very seriously—lay down the\r\n“natural law” that the magnitude of the scientific achievement is in\r\ninverse proportion to the size of the scientific institute. The official\r\npeople at Berlin did not fail to make a biting retort to these Radical\r\nstrictures—that in 1881, when he wanted to go to Ceylon, he was formally\r\nrefused assistance by the Berlin Academy from the travelling-fee (then\r\nat liberty) attached to the Humboldt foundation. He made the journey\r\nwithout their assistance, and had the splendid revenge of giving us, in\r\nthe description of this very voyage, the most brilliant account of the\r\ntropics that has appeared in Germany since the time of Humboldt. It was\r\na finer contribution to the general ideal of the Humboldt foundation\r\nthan the timid payment of a hundred pounds could have secured. However,\r\nwe are anticipating. Before that time he was to spend a short but happy\r\nperiod at Berlin in the fifties, in the best days of his youth—a Berlin\r\nof a different scientific character from the present city, being at once\r\nless pretentious and more profound, whichever the reader chooses to\r\ndwell on.\r\n\r\nCertain traits could be recognised unmistakably in the boy. He had a\r\ngreat love of nature, of light, colour, and beauty, of flowers and trees\r\nand butterflies, of the sun and the blue heavens. There was also a\r\nstrong sense of independence and individuality. This did not imply that\r\nhe was lacking in gentler feeling. It is said that he would do anything\r\nthat he was asked but nothing that it was sought to compel him to do.\r\nThe little fair, blue-eyed lad would sit quietly if they gave him a\r\ndaisy to pull to pieces. First he would, as if he were a student\r\nanalysing it, detach the white leaves from the central yellow ground.\r\nThen he would carefully replace them, piece by piece, round the yellow\r\ncentre, clap his little hands and cry out, “Now it’s all right again.”\r\nIt is a very pretty trait that tradition has preserved. In the play of\r\nthe child we seem to see the chief lines of the man’s character like two\r\nbranches of a tree; the analytic work of the scientist and the\r\nreconstructive tendency of the artist who restores the dissected world\r\nto harmony.\r\n\r\nHis excellent training in those early years fostered his feeling for\r\nnature and his sense of independence with wise adaptation to the\r\npersonal character of the boy. The mother gladly cultivated his love of\r\nnature. On the deeper development of his character a decisive influence\r\nwas exercised, with every regard for freedom, by a friend of the family,\r\nthe physician Basedow. His ideal was education without compulsion, by\r\nmeans of a sort of constant artificial selection and cultivation of the\r\ngood that grew up spontaneously in the soul of the child. The father, a\r\ngreat worker, was content to give a word of praise occasionally; to urge\r\nhim to go to the root of things always, and never to coquet idly with\r\nhis own soul. If the young dreamer stood at the window and looked up at\r\nthe clouds, his father would pat him on the shoulder and say, “Every\r\nminute has its value in this world. Play or work—but do something.” It\r\nwas, in a sense, the voice of the restless nineteenth century itself\r\nthat spoke. The whole life of the youth and the man was to be an eternal\r\nproof that he had heard the message. He has pressed unwearyingly\r\nforward, as few other men have done. There was ever something in him of\r\nthe mountaineer, hurrying on and watching every hour that he may reach\r\nthe summit. The day of rest may come afterwards, down below in the\r\nvalley. In truth, it never came. It is well known that the man wrote\r\nsome of his most difficult, most widely read, and most controverted\r\nworks subsequently in a few months, encroaching upon his night’s rest\r\nuntil his health was endangered. In a remote Cingalese village in\r\nCeylon, where the enervating tropical climate forces even the strongest\r\nto indulge in the afternoon siesta, he tells himself that, in view of\r\nthe great expense of the journey, each day is worth a five-pound note.\r\nHe refuses to sleep long hours or take the siesta, rises at five in the\r\nmorning, and uses the hottest hours of the day, from twelve to four, for\r\n“anatomical and microscopic work, observing and drawing, and for packing\r\nup the material collected.” He met to the full the claim of the\r\nnineteenth century, for all the inner poetic tendency of his character.\r\nSuch a character he must have had to become a philosopher, as he has\r\ndone; but it lay, as it were, in deeper recesses of his being. To the\r\neye of the observer he seemed to be ever rushing on with a watch in his\r\nhand until old age. When we think of the enormous number of problems and\r\nthe vast range of interests that brought him into the front rank in the\r\nnineteenth century, we may say that he advanced at a pace that would\r\nhave given concern to the aged adviser of his youth in his small world.\r\n\r\nIn the long run we may say of all education as of the physician in the\r\nold saying, “The best doctor is the one we don’t need, because we are\r\nnot ill.” Haeckel was sent to the school at Merseburg. This instruction\r\ncame to a close in his eighteenth year. He thought of some of his old\r\nteachers with affection forty years afterwards. On the whole his later\r\nopinion of the usual schooling was as severe as that of many of his\r\ncontemporaries. In his _General Morphology_ (1866), his most profound\r\nwork, he speaks of the “very defective, perverse, and often really\r\nmischievous instruction, by which we are filled with absurd errors,\r\ninstead of natural truths, in our most impressionable years.” Sixteen\r\nyears afterwards (in a speech delivered at Eisenach) he hopes that the\r\ntriumphant science of evolution “will put an end to one of the greatest\r\nevils in our present system of education—that overloading of the memory\r\nwith dead material that destroys the finest powers, and prevents the\r\nnormal development of either mind or body.” “This overloading,” he says,\r\n“is due to the old and ineradicable error that the excellence of\r\neducation is to be judged by the quantity of positive facts committed to\r\nmemory, instead of by the quality of the real knowledge imparted. Hence\r\nit is especially advisable to make a more careful selection of the\r\nmatter of instruction both in the higher and the elementary schools, and\r\nnot to give precedence to the faculties that burden the memory with\r\nmasses of dead facts, but to those that build up the judgment with the\r\nliving play of the idea of evolution. Let our tortured children learn\r\nonly half what they do, but learn it better, and the next generation\r\nwill be twice as sound as the present one in body and soul. The reform\r\nof education, which, we trust, will be brought about by introducing the\r\nidea of evolution, must apply to the mathematical and scientific, as\r\nwell as the philological and historical sections, because there is the\r\nsame fault in them all, that far too much material is injected, and far\r\ntoo little attention is paid to its digestion.” Seventeen years later\r\nagain, in the _Riddle of the Universe_, the elementary schools are\r\nseverely handled. Science is still the Cinderella of the code. Our\r\nteachers regard it as their chief duty to impart “the dead knowledge\r\nthat has come down from the schools of the Middle Ages. They give the\r\nfirst place to their grammatical gymnastics, and waste time in imparting\r\na ‘thorough knowledge’ of the classical tongues and foreign history.”\r\nThere is no question of cosmology, anthropology, or biology; instead of\r\nthese “the memory is loaded with a mass of philological and historical\r\nfacts that are quite useless either from the theoretical or the\r\npractical point of view.” In these expressions, which recur constantly\r\nthroughout the whole of a thoughtful life, we can clearly see a very\r\nintense general experience of youth, and this is a more valuable\r\ndocument than any individualised complaint against this or that bad\r\nteacher in particular.\r\n\r\nHowever, Haeckel (who, in point of fact, took everything seriously and\r\nwould have all in the clearest order) made a very thorough appropriation\r\nof his Latin and Greek. When the new Darwinian zoology and botany needed\r\nseveral hundred new Latin-Greek technical terms in after-years, he\r\nshowed himself to be an inventor of the first rank in this department.\r\nNo other scientist has made anything like the same adroit use of the\r\nclassic vocabulary for the purposes of the new system and created a new\r\nterminology for the entirely new science. His creations were certainly\r\ningenious, and not without grace at times; in other cases, as was almost\r\ninevitable, they were less pleasing. And to this we must add thousands\r\nof names of new species which he had to coin, as the discoverer of\r\nradiolaria, medusæ, sponges, &c. In the radiolaria alone he has formed\r\nand published the names of more than 3,500 new species. I fancy that\r\neven the oldest pastor of the most fertile congregation has never\r\nconducted so many christenings. In each case it was necessary to impose\r\ntwo names, the generic and specific. We may well expect to find a few\r\nthat will not last, but the reader is amazed at the philological\r\ncreative power of this busy godfather and the inexhaustibility of his\r\nvocabulary; they show far more than the usual training in humanities.\r\n\r\nHis real predilection was pronounced enough in those early years. It was\r\nwhat the classical pedagogue would regard as child’s play and waste of\r\ntime—zoology and botany. A large double window in his parents’ house was\r\nfitted up as a conservatory, and plants were gathered very zealously.\r\nHis love of botany was so great that any one would have pronounced him a\r\nbotanist in the making. But fate determined that he was to be a\r\nzoologist. In his eleventh year the boy, while paying a visit to his\r\nuncle Bleek (a professor of theology!) at Bonn, spent a whole day\r\nsearching the remotest corners of the Siebengebirg for the _Erica\r\ncinerea_, which he had heard could not be found in any other part of\r\nGermany. At the Merseburg school he had two excellent teachers, Gandtner\r\nand Karl Gude, who fostered his inclination, and changed it from a mere\r\ncollector’s eagerness into the finer enjoyment of the scientific mind.\r\nThe young student wrote a contribution to Garcke’s _Flora Hallensis_.\r\nThe professional decision gives many a troubled hour.\r\n\r\nIt is significant to find that as the novice tended his herbarium it\r\ndawned on him that there was a weak point somewhere in the rigid\r\nclassification given in the manuals of botany. The books said that there\r\nwere so many fixed species, each invariably recognisable by certain\r\ncharacters. But when the youth tried to diagnose his plant-treasures in\r\npractice by these rules, there seemed to be always a few contraband\r\nspecies smuggled in, like the spectres in the Wahlpurgis night to which\r\nthe sage vainly expostulates, “Begone: we have explained you away.”\r\nOften the individual specimens would not agree with the lore of the\r\nbooks. There were discrepancies; sometimes they cut across one type,\r\nsometimes another, and at times they shamelessly stretched across the\r\ngap between one rubric and another. What did it mean? Were there really\r\nno fixed species? Was “species” only an idea, and was the reality of the\r\nplant-world in a state of flux like the sea? Teachers and books insisted\r\nthat the “species” is, in its absolute nature, the basis of all\r\nbotanical science, the great and sacred foundation that the Moses of\r\nbotany and zoology, Linné, had laid down for ever. How could it be so?\r\n\r\nThe mature worker would look back on this dilemma of his youth with a\r\nsmile of satisfaction thirty years afterwards. He would know then what\r\nsort of a nut it was that he was trying to crack in his early\r\nspeculations. It was nothing less than the magnificent problem that\r\npresented itself to Darwin, the crucial question of the fixity or\r\nvariability of species. “The problem of the constancy or transmutation\r\nof species,” he wrote, “arrested me with a lively interest when, twenty\r\nyears ago, as a boy of twelve years, I made a resolute but fruitless\r\neffort to determine and distinguish the ‘good and bad species’ of\r\nblackberries, willows, roses, and thistles. I look back now with fond\r\nsatisfaction on the concern and painful scepticism that stirred my\r\nyouthful spirits as I wavered and hesitated (in the manner of most ‘good\r\nclassifiers,’ as we called them) whether to admit only ‘good’ specimens\r\ninto my herbarium and reject the ‘bad,’ or to embrace the latter and\r\nform a complete chain of transitional forms between the ‘good species’\r\nthat would make an end of all their ‘goodness.’ I got out of the\r\ndifficulty at the time by a compromise that I can recommend to all\r\nclassifiers. I made two collections. One, arranged on official lines,\r\noffered to the sympathetic observer all the species, in ‘typical’\r\nspecimens, as radically distinct forms, each decked with its pretty\r\nlabel; the other was a private collection, only shown to one trusted\r\nfriend, and contained only the rejected kinds that Goethe so happily\r\ncalled ‘the characterless or disorderly races, which we hardly dare\r\nascribe to a species, as they lose themselves in infinite varieties,’\r\nsuch as rubus, salix, verbascum, hieracium, rosa, cirsium, &c. In this a\r\nlarge number of specimens, arranged in a long series, illustrated the\r\ndirect transition from one good species to another. They were the\r\nofficially forbidden fruit of knowledge in which I took a secret boyish\r\ndelight in my leisure hours.”\r\n\r\nThese little scruples, however, did not interfere with what he felt to\r\nbe the chief interest of botany. The collecting of plants harmonises\r\nwell with a general love of nature and a passion for wandering over hill\r\nand valley. Long walks had already become a feature of his life. The\r\nscientific interest made it superfluous to have a companion. Botany went\r\nwith him everywhere as his lady-love, and remained ever faithful to him.\r\n“I have preferred to travel alone most of my life,” he used to say to\r\nme; “I never feel _ennui_ when I am alone. My love of and interest in\r\nnature are much better entertainment than conversation.” One of the\r\nfeatures in this interest at all times, even in later years, was\r\nbotanical research. The material for it is found everywhere. Darwin, a\r\ngreat traveller with an unusually strong appreciation of good scenery,\r\nhas said that the traveller who would combine the pursuit of knowledge\r\nwith æsthetic satisfaction must be above all a botanist(in the closing\r\nretrospect of his _Naturalist’s Voyage Round the World_, one of the\r\nfinest passages in the work). Whenever Haeckel spoke in later years of\r\nhis adopted Jena, he never failed to explain, amongst the other\r\nexcellent qualities of the little university town, that so many fine\r\norchids grew in its woods. When he left Jena to make the long voyage to\r\nCeylon, his last look was at the drops of dew that sparkled like pearls\r\n“in the dark blue calices of the gentians, with their tender lashes,\r\nthat so richly decked the grass-covered sides of the railway cutting.”\r\nThe _Letters from India_, that described his voyage, owes a good deal of\r\nits peculiar charm to his skill in botanical description. I know no\r\nother work that approaches it in conveying so effective an idea of the\r\nluxuriant vegetation of the tropics.\r\n\r\nIn those early years there was one particular point of close union\r\nbetween botany and the sense of beauty. It was only two years before\r\nHaeckel’s birth that Goethe, the man who had put into inimitable verse\r\nnew and pregnant truths of botany, passed to his rest at Weimar.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer a special distinction of any prominent personality of\r\nthe nineteenth century to have been influenced by Goethe. It is a kind\r\nof natural necessity from which one cannot escape. All that is great in\r\nthe century can be traced back to Goethe. He flows beneath it, like a\r\ndark stream through the bowels of a mountain. Here and there the flanks\r\nopen and the stream becomes visible; not a restless bubbling spring, but\r\na broad mirror. There is, however, a closer following of Goethe. There\r\nare a few strong spirits that have been consciously inspired by him from\r\nthe first in all their thoughts; have throughout life felt themselves to\r\nbe the apostles of the “gospel of Goethe”; and in every new creation of\r\ntheir own have held that they did but reflect or expand his ideas, did\r\nbut carry on his principles to these further conclusions. Haeckel is, in\r\nhis whole work, one of this smaller band; his whole personality is, in\r\nfact, one of its most conspicuous manifestations in the second half of\r\nthe century.\r\n\r\nIn Goethe we find the basic ideas of his philosophy. Goethe took from\r\nhim his God, and gave him a new one: took from him the external,\r\ntranscendental God of the Churches, and gave him the God that is in all\r\nthings, in the eternal development of the world, in body and soul alike,\r\nthe God that embraces all reality and being, beside whom there is no\r\ndistinct “world,” no distinct “sinful man,” no special beginning or end\r\nof things. When Haeckel found himself, at the highest point of his own\r\npath, by the side of Darwin, he was the first to see and to insist that\r\nDarwin was but a stage in the logical development of Goethe’s ideas.\r\n\r\nFate decided that Haeckel should be even externally in some sense an\r\nheir of the Goethe epoch. Jena, the university that Goethe had regarded\r\nwith such affection, and at which Schiller had toiled with his heart’s\r\nblood in “sad, splendid years,” owes its fame in the last third of the\r\ncentury to Haeckel. It is not an excess of adulation, but a simple\r\ntruth, to say that among the general public and abroad the reputation of\r\nJena passes directly from Goethe, Schiller, and Fichte to Haeckel. His\r\nname stands for an epoch in the life of Jena, like theirs; all that lies\r\nbetween is forgotten and unknown. In the district itself it is as if the\r\nold epochs and the new came into direct touch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JENA.\r\n  _From “Jena in Wort und Bild” (Frommann’sche Hofbuchhandlung, Jena)._\r\n]\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the hour when this thought came upon me in all its\r\nforce. It was on a snowless December day, when the dying fire of autumn\r\nstill lingered on the trees and bushes where the blackbirds sang in\r\nfront of the observatory. The table and seat of sandstone stood out\r\nbleakly. A tablet indicated, in phrases of Goethe’s, that Schiller had\r\ndwelt there. It was there that the Wallenstein was born. There the two\r\noften sat in conversation—the conversation of two of the greatest minds\r\nof the time, each in his way a master spirit. To-day the little dome of\r\nthe observatory looks down on the spot; it is not a luxurious building,\r\nbut it is a stage in the onward journey, a symbol of the nineteenth\r\ncentury as it leaps into the twentieth. A little farther off rises the\r\nmodern structure of the Zoological Institute. In Goethe’s day no one\r\ndreamed that such a building would ever be seen. It was opened by\r\nHaeckel in 1884. The zoological collection it houses was chiefly brought\r\ntogether under his direction. Amongst its treasures are, besides\r\nHaeckel’s corals and the like, the outcome of the travels of Semon and\r\nKükenthal in Australia and New Guinea—lands whose very outline could\r\nbarely be traced in the mist when Schiller was a professor at Jena. At\r\nthe entrance there are two stuffed orangs, our distant cousins. One wall\r\nof the lecture-hall is covered with huge charts depicting the\r\ngenealogical tree of life, as it is drawn up by Haeckel. With what eyes\r\nSchiller would have devoured them! Yet classic traits are not wanting.\r\nFrom Haeckel’s fine study in the Institute the eye falls on the\r\nHausberg, “the mountain-top from which the red rays stream.” It is the\r\nroom in which the deep-sea radiolaria of the _Challenger_ Expedition\r\nwere studied, a zoological campaign in depths of the ocean that were\r\nstranger to Schiller’s days than the surface of the moon is to us.\r\nBehind this Goethe-Schiller seat at the observatory there is a natural\r\ndepression full of willows that reminds us of the time when all was\r\ncountry here. But just beyond it is a modern street—“Ernst Haeckel\r\nStreet,” as it was named, in honour of him, on the occasion of his\r\nsixtieth birthday. Close to it is the villa where he has lived for many\r\nyears with his devoted family, full of wonderful reminiscences\r\n(oil-paintings and water-colours from his own hand) of his many travels.\r\nIn Schiller’s day a voyage to Ceylon would have been a life’s work.\r\nTo-day it is an episode in an infinitely richer and broader life. On the\r\nstone seat now we see the proud and handsome figure of the man himself,\r\nrecalling pleasantly the masters who have stood here before him, the\r\nwide hat covering the white hair that is belied by the rosy cheeks; a\r\nstraight and strong figure, yet revealing in the finer lines of the face\r\nthe sensitive, æsthetic temper that does not look on scientific\r\ninvestigation as a brutal power of the dissecting knife, but remembers\r\nhe is the heir of Goethe, even in the Zoological Institute yonder. Over\r\nmy mind came the feeling of a strange rebirth of things. I felt that\r\nlife is an eternally new and mystic resurrection, immeasurably more\r\nwonderful and profound than all the crude ideas of resurrection that\r\nhave yet prevailed. A mind such as we love to picture to ourselves in\r\nour ideal of the future historian must seek the eternal and constant\r\nfeatures in all change, even in two epochs that are so distinct and in\r\nthe men who have lived in them. It is our incorrigible schoolmaster\r\ndisposition that divides things. In the real world there must be one\r\nstraight line of development. To-day the highest is sought in the melody\r\nof immortal verse: to-morrow a Zoological Institute rises on the spot\r\nwhere the poet had stood.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the boy did not come under the influence of Goethe\r\nwithout some difficulty. His mother did not like Goethe; she preferred\r\nSchiller. Goethe was too great for every true soul to follow him in his\r\narduous path. Weimar itself had more than once been disposed to desert\r\nhim. How much more the general public in its conventional fetters! How\r\nmany fell away from him when he published the _Roman Elegies_, and again\r\nwhen he brought out the _Elective Affinities_. In Haeckel’s youth people\r\nremembered Börne’s narrow and hostile strictures. Goethe began to\r\npenetrate into the German family as a classic in spite of the general\r\nfeeling. But the German family was still far below him. He had gradually\r\nto lift it up from its Philistine level. At times it rebelled against\r\nhim, as every stubborn level does against a peak. It was his aunt Bertha\r\nthat first put Goethe’s works into the boy’s hands. He received them as\r\na delightful piece of moral contraband.\r\n\r\nGottfried Keller has finely described, about the same period, in his\r\n_Green Henry_, the effect of such a revelation on a sensitive young man.\r\nA bookseller brings to the house the whole of Goethe’s works, fifty\r\nsmall volumes with red covers and gilded titles. The young Swiss\r\nHeinrich, Keller’s picture of himself, reads the volumes unceasingly for\r\nthirty days, when they are taken away because his mother cannot pay for\r\nthem. But the thirty days have been a dream to the boy. He seems to see\r\nnew and more brilliant stars in the heavens as he looks up. When the\r\nbooks are removed, it is as if a choir of bright angels have left the\r\nroom. “I went out into the open air. The old town on the hill, the rocks\r\nand woods and river and sea and the lines of the mountains lay in the\r\ngentle light of the March sun, and as my eye fell on them I felt a pure\r\nand lasting joy that I had never known before. It was a generous love of\r\nall that lives, a love that respects the right and realises the import\r\nof each thing, and feels the connectedness and depth of the world. This\r\nlove is higher than the artificial affection of the individual with\r\nselfish aim that ever leads to pettiness and caprice; it is higher even\r\nthan the enjoyment and detachment that come of special and romantic\r\naffections; it alone can give us an unchanging and lasting glow.\r\nEverything now came before me in new and beautiful and remarkable forms.\r\nI began to see and to love, not only the outer form, but the inner\r\ncontent, the nature, and the history of things.” The poet compresses his\r\nexperience into one episode. In real life it comes slowly, step by step.\r\nIn fine, a third element was born in the young botanist and lover of\r\nbeauty—Goethe’s view of life behind all else: that which Goethe himself\r\ncalled “objective.” The mystic might call it a return to God: but it was\r\nGoethe’s God.\r\n\r\nThree other books influenced Haeckel in his school-days, besides the\r\nworks of Goethe. The first was Humboldt’s _Aspects of Nature_. This is\r\nanother work that has had an effect on all the sensitive spirits of the\r\nnineteenth century. It is most unjustly depreciated by the young,\r\n_blasé_ generation of our time, which dislikes the older style. In the\r\nfirst two volumes of the _Cosmos_ we see the play of a great mind\r\nwherever we look for it.\r\n\r\nThen came Darwin’s _Naturalist’s Voyage round the World_. The ardent\r\nyouth had as yet on suspicion what the name would one day mean to him.\r\nDarwin was then regarded as a completed work on which final judgment had\r\nbeen rendered. He was appreciated as a traveller, a student of the\r\ngeology of South America, and especially as the gifted investigator of\r\nthe wonderful coral reefs of the Indian Ocean. His name stood thus in\r\nall the manuals, close even to that of Humboldt. Probably the young\r\nreader thought he had died long before. At all events, no one had a\r\npresentiment that this quiet naturalist and student of corals was about\r\nto light a torch that would flame over the world. The chief advantage\r\nthat Haeckel drew from the two works was an ardent desire to see the\r\ntropics, with their virgin forests and blue coral seas. It has come to\r\nso many after reading these works, and persisted in their lives as the\r\nvivid image of a dream, like that which drove Goethe to Italy—the dream\r\nof a home of the soul that must one day be sought.\r\n\r\nThe third book was Schleiden’s _The Plant and its Life_. Matthias Jacob\r\nSchleiden was then in the best of his power, and had an influence that\r\namounted to fascination on many of the younger men. Behind him lay a\r\nterrible struggle. He had begun his career as a lawyer, and had been so\r\nunfortunate that he even attempted his life. With his interest in botany\r\na new life began, and he worked with the energy of one raised from the\r\ndead. He was certainly an original thinker. His name is known to us\r\nto-day especially as the founder of the cell-theory. This is the\r\ngreatest distinction that he has earned. But at that time he had a much\r\nmore general importance as a leader in the struggle to introduce a\r\ncertain method of scientific research. A somewhat obscure epoch was\r\ncoming to a close, a more or less superficial natural philosophy having\r\nsought to replace sound investigation. The struggle had ended with the\r\ndecisive victory of the simple discovery of facts. There was everywhere\r\na vague feeling that the progress of science was best secured by a bald\r\nenumeration and registration of bones, of the joints in the limbs of\r\ninsects, or of pollen-filaments, rather than by the romantic and\r\nspirited leaps of natural philosophy over all the real problems into the\r\nheavens above. The question now arose whether this narrow method really\r\nexhausted the nature of things; whether scientific specialism, with its\r\nlaurels of victory, would not prove in the end an equally dangerous\r\nenemy. What was “better” for the time being might be very far from\r\nreally “good.” It was here that Schleiden stepped in. He fought against\r\nthe prevailing specialism, at first in his own particular province of\r\nbotany. He did not, indeed, take up the cause of the exploded\r\npyrotechnics of the older natural philosophy, but pleaded for more\r\ngeneral critical-philosophical methods. These must be preserved in any\r\ncircumstances. The great botanist, he said, is not the man who can\r\ndetermine ten thousand species of plants according to the received\r\nmodels, but the man of clear logic and wide deductions from his lore.\r\nBotany must be conceived as a distinct branch of general thought;\r\notherwise it is worthless, and its herbarium may rot unnoticed in the\r\ncorner and its discoveries be the outcome of blind hazard. Schleiden\r\nhimself had no perception of the great idea that Darwin was to bring\r\ninto his province afterwards—the idea of the variability of species and\r\nof evolution, which brought to a critical stage the question whether the\r\nbotanist was to be merely a subordinate museum-secretary or a creative\r\nthinker, a prophet of nature to whom plants would be part of a general\r\nphilosophy, a part of God in the ideal sense of evolution. Yet\r\nSchleiden’s simple warning cry made a deep impression on many of the\r\nyoung men especially. There was a note of aspiration in it, an assurance\r\nthat they were waiting for a sun that _must_ rise somewhere. He was a\r\nmaster of language. There was the stuff of the poet in him. His works\r\nstrayed out far beyond the range of his own province. Haeckel himself\r\ndid the same work in later years. It is no wonder that Schleiden had a\r\nmagical influence over him. In this case, indeed, it seemed as if the\r\nattraction was to determine his own career.\r\n\r\nSchleiden taught botany at Jena University. Haeckel was still in the\r\nhigher forms of his school at Merseburg, and remained there when his\r\nfather resigned his position in the State service, and eventually\r\nremoved to Berlin. At this time the ardent botanist decided to adopt the\r\nscience of plants as his life-study when his final examination was over.\r\nSchleiden would teach him how to combine philosophy with botany. Then he\r\nwould try to roam over the world as a practical botanist and visit the\r\nfar-off zones where Mother Earth poured out her cornucopia of forms so\r\ngenerously.\r\n\r\nWhile still in the higher form at school he made a preliminary visit to\r\nJena. Everything seemed so pleasant and charming. He made the journey on\r\nfoot. These long walks have always been his pride—to start out like a\r\ntravelling scholar, with hardly anything in his pocket, to live on bread\r\nand water, and sleep in the hay at night; but to enjoy to the full all\r\nthe incomparable delights that the great magician, nature, provides for\r\nthe faithful novice—scenery, beautiful orchids, thoughts of God, Goethe,\r\nand the world. It was in 1849 that he visited Jena. He has described it\r\nhimself: “After I had reverently admired the Goethe-room in the castle\r\nof Dornburg, I wandered, on a hot July day, over the shady meadows to\r\nJena, singing lustily with my gay comrades. As I entered the venerable\r\nold market-place I found a troop of lively students in front of the\r\nBurgkeller, with coloured caps and long pipes, singing, and drinking the\r\nfamous Lichtenhain beer from wooden tankards. It made a great impression\r\non me, and as I took a tankard with them I made up my mind that I would\r\nsome day be one of them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                           AT THE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was botany itself that thwarted all these designs. The examination\r\nhad passed off happily. Rooms were taken at Jena, at the Easter of 1852,\r\nfor the advanced study under Schleiden. Then the indefatigable collector\r\nhad an adventure on a cold March day. He spent hours in the wet meadows\r\nby the river Saale, searching for a rare plant, the squill (_Scilla\r\nbifolia_). He met with the fate of the angler in the story, who fell\r\ninto the water in his haste to secure his big pike. He landed the fish,\r\nbut not himself. The plant was found, but Haeckel’s zeal was punished\r\nwith a severe rheumatism. He had to go home to his parents at Berlin to\r\nbe tended. At Berlin he begins his studies, and the event to some extent\r\ndecides his career. It would now be many years before he would see Jena\r\nagain; and through his efforts it would become one of the leading\r\nschools, not of botany, but of zoology—a school of _philosophical_\r\nzoology, however, in the sense of Schleiden.\r\n\r\nBerlin had secured a botanist of the first rank a year before, Alexander\r\nBraun. He, too, was a thoughtful botanist, who would in his way agree\r\nvery well with Schleiden. He was convinced that botany did not wholly\r\nconsist in the determination of new plant forms and the almost fruitless\r\neffort to set up a system on which all particular diagnoses would be\r\nrigidly played as on a piano. He believed that there must be a more\r\nprofound conception of it, which would take “form,” as such, as one of\r\nits problems, and would aim, not at the formation of as large a\r\ncollection as possible, but at the construction of a science for which\r\nGoethe had long ago found a name—morphology, or the science of forms. It\r\nhappened that Braun was a friendly visitor at the house of Haeckel’s\r\nparents at Berlin. The now convalescent freshman became devoted to him,\r\nbody and soul; they became close friends, not merely master and pupil.\r\nBerlin at that time afforded many an opportunity for practical\r\nbotanising. Rare marsh-plants then flourished in the bed of the Spree,\r\nwhich has since been cleared. The Botanical Garden was full of good\r\nthings. Haeckel used to tell with pride, long afterwards, with what\r\nreadiness he flung himself into the work, practical as well as\r\ntheoretical, on these excursions with Professor Braun. “On one of our\r\nbotanical expeditions we wanted to get a floating chara from a pond.\r\nBraun took off his boots in his usual way in order to wade to the spot.\r\nBut I was before him. I quickly undressed, forgot my naughty rheumatism,\r\nand swam to the spot, to bring him a quantity of the plant he wanted.\r\nThat was my first piece of heroism, perhaps my greatest.”\r\n\r\nBut in all this pleasant botanising there was no serious outlook on his\r\nfuture profession. Haeckel’s father, with his official way of looking at\r\nthings, could not reconcile himself to scientific research as an\r\navocation. It is an old belief that the way to all preoccupation with\r\nthe science of living things lies through medicine. One may question\r\nthat to-day. It was the rock on which Darwin nearly came to grief. A man\r\nmay be a very gifted botanist, yet be quite unfitted for the medical\r\nprofession. One must have a real vocation to become a physician, more\r\nthan for any other calling, or else it is a hopeless blunder. The\r\ntalents are divided in much the same way as between the historian and\r\nthe soldier. It is true that the two may be united, but it is equally\r\ntrue that very good historians have made very poor soldiers. What the\r\nmedical man learns in his studies is, of course, always valuable. But it\r\noffers no test of personal talent for scientific research, nor should it\r\nbe supposed that a capacity of this kind would be able, by mere formal\r\nstudy, to acquire the true qualities of a physician. We must learn to\r\nappreciate the physician’s calling too much ever to look on it as an\r\nincidental occupation. It always reminds me of the amiable notion of the\r\nPhilistine, that a man with a turn for poetry must first take up some\r\nsolid profession, and then, once he is “in the saddle,” pour out verses\r\nin his leisure hours. Poetry can never be a mistress: it demands\r\nmarriage or nothing. Otherwise—well, we have instances enough.\r\n\r\nHaeckel himself afterwards said that he only acceded to his father’s\r\nwish, that he should study medicine, with a botanical mental\r\nreservation. He thought of going through the discipline conscientiously\r\nuntil he became a physician, and then secure a place as ship’s doctor,\r\nand travel over the world and see the tropics. Things turned out very\r\ndifferently. He never became a medical man such as his father had\r\nwished, but he passed over the profession into zoology. Botany remained\r\nthe lost and never-forgotten love of his youth. When we look back on his\r\nwhole career we can see that he was, on the whole, fortunate. Zoology\r\nafforded a richer, more abundant, and more varied material at that time.\r\nIt proved to be more “philosophical.” He went after his father’s asses\r\nand found a kingdom. But to him personally it seemed to be an\r\nunmistakable renunciation—the first in an active career that was to see\r\nmany resignations.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“He goes farthest who does not know where he is going.”\r\n\r\nHaeckel once applied this motto to himself and his star, in a humorous\r\nafter-dinner speech. With this kind of safe predestination he reached\r\nWürtzburg in the autumn of 1852 as a medical student. Medicine had in\r\nthose days received an entirely new theoretical basis from Würtzburg—a\r\nbasis that was calculated to attract a young inquirer, who brought much\r\nmore of the general Faust-spirit to his work than aspiration to the\r\nprofession and the doctor’s cap, or the practical side.\r\n\r\nLet us recall for a moment how medicine had gradually reached the\r\nposition of an independent science. Medicine was the outcome of a remote\r\nmythical epoch. It was content with the effect of certain venerable\r\ntraditional medicaments on the living body, but knew little or nothing\r\nof the inner structure of the body on which it tried its drugs. The\r\ndissection and examination of even a corpse was regarded as a deadly\r\nsin, and was visited with secular punishment. Scientific medicine did\r\nnot exist until this prohibition was removed; its first and most\r\nnecessary foundation was anatomy, the science of the bodily structure\r\nand its organs. The art of “cutting up” bodies had seemed too revolting.\r\nMoreover, no sooner had the science of anatomy been founded than the\r\nrange of the human eye itself was considerably enlarged. The microscope\r\nwas invented. A new world came to light in the dissection of the body.\r\nBeyond their external appearance it revealed the internal composition of\r\nthe various organs. The eye sees a shred of skin, a piece of intestine,\r\nor a section of the liver. The microscope fastens on a tiny particle of\r\nthis portion of the body, and reveals in it a deeper layer of\r\nunsuspected structures. It is well known in the history of microscopic\r\ndiscovery that the more powerful lenses and the improved methods of\r\nresearch were only gradually introduced, and enabled students to found a\r\nnew and much profounder anatomy. As soon as this science appeared it was\r\ngiven the special name of “histology,” or the science of the tissues\r\n(_hista_). Its particular achievement is the discovery that in man, the\r\nanimal, and the plant, all the parts of the body prove, when\r\nsufficiently magnified, to be composed of small living elements, which\r\nare known as cells. The discovery of the cell was made in the latter\r\npart of the third decade of the nineteenth century. These cells join\r\ntogether in homogeneous groups in order to accomplish one or other\r\nfunction in the body, and thus form its “tissues.” Their intricate\r\nstructure is unravelled by the histologist, microscope in hand. It is\r\nevident that in this way a new basis was provided for anatomy, and\r\ntherefore also for medicine. In the fifties Würtzburg was the leading\r\nschool of histology, or the science of these tissues composed of cells.\r\nAlbert Kölliker, professor of anatomy there since 1847, published his\r\nsplendid _Manual of Histology_ at the very time when Haeckel was\r\nstudying under him. Franz Leydig, a tutor there since 1849, was working\r\nin the same direction. The third member of the group, made professor in\r\n1849, was Rudolf Virchow, a young teacher then in his best years. It was\r\nVirchow who did most to bring practical medicine into line with\r\nhistology. As the vital processes in the human body seemed to him, with\r\nhis strict histological outlook, to be traced back always to the\r\ntissue-building cells, he concluded that disease also, or the\r\npathological condition of the body, and therefore the proper field of\r\nthe medical man, was a process in these cells. Man seemed to him to be a\r\n“cell-state”: the tissues were the various active social strata in this\r\nstate: and disease was, in its ultimate source, a conflict in the state\r\nbetween the citizens, the tissue-forming cells, that normally divide the\r\nwork amongst them for the common good. Pathology must be cellular\r\npathology. The science was already being taught by Virchow at Würtzburg,\r\nand the dry bones of it were covered with flesh for his hearers. But his\r\nideas were not published until a few years afterwards (1858).\r\n\r\nIn the first three terms Haeckel studied chiefly under Kölliker and\r\nLeydig. They taught him animal and human embryology, as it was then\r\nconceived. Embryology was the science of the development of the\r\nindividual animal or man, the description of the series of changes that\r\nthe chick passes through in the egg or the human embryo in the womb.\r\nThis science, also, had been profoundly affected by the invention of the\r\nmicroscope. Firstly, the spermatozoa, the active, microscopically small\r\nparticles in the animal and human sperm, had been discovered. Then, in\r\nthe twenties, Karl Ernst von Baer had discovered the human ovum. The\r\nrelation of these things to the cell-theory was clear. It was\r\nindubitable that each of these male spermatozoa and each female ovum was\r\na cell. They melted together and were blended into a new cell in the act\r\nof procreation, and from this, by a process of repeated cleavage of\r\ncells, the new individual was developed with all his millions of cells\r\nand all the elaborate tissues that these cells united to form. A whole\r\nworld of marvellous features came to light, but the key to the\r\nunriddling of them was still wanting.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Würtzburg school was at least agreed as to _method_, which\r\nwas the main thing; its leaders were determined to press on to the\r\nsolution of these problems on purely scientific lines. Everything was to\r\nbe brought into a logical relation of cause and effect, and there was to\r\nbe no intrusion of the supernatural, no mysticism. Natural laws must be\r\ntraced in the life of the cells and in the history of the ovum and the\r\nembryo. The cells were to be regarded in the same way as the astronomer\r\nregards his myriads of glittering bodies. In this way the science of\r\nhistology had been founded, and embryology had assumed a scientific\r\ncharacter in the hands of Von Baer. The microscope kept the attention of\r\nstudents to facts, and did not suffer them to lose themselves in the\r\nclouds. Thus a foundation-stone was laid in Haeckel’s thoughts which he\r\nwould never discard.\r\n\r\nIn the later years of the Darwinian controversy he was destined to come\r\ninto sharp conflict with both Virchow and Kölliker. Each of them came to\r\nlook on him as the sober hen does on the naughty chick it has brought\r\ninto the world, that madly tries to swim on the treacherous waters of\r\nDarwinism. But forty years afterwards—after many a knife-edged word had\r\nbeen thrown in the struggle—the aged Kölliker was one of those who\r\nentered their names in the list of men of science who erected a bust in\r\nthe Zoological Institute at Jena in honour of Haeckel’s sixtieth\r\nbirthday.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was a different, an apparently trivial, yet, as it turned\r\nout, most momentous interest that quickened him during these University\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe impulse to microscopic research, that had led to the foundation of\r\nhistology and embryology, had brought about a third great advance\r\nwhich had an important bearing on zoology. When we stroll along the\r\nbeautiful shore of the Mediterranean at Naples to-day, with eyes bent\r\non the blue surface from which Capri rises like a siren, and on the\r\ncloud-capped Vesuvius with its violet streaks of lava cutting across\r\nthe green country, we notice in the foreground of the picture a stout\r\nbuilding, with very large windows, planted with the boldness of a\r\n_parvenu_ amongst the foliage. It is the “Zoological Station,” built\r\nby Dohrn, a German zoologist, at the beginning of the seventies. Anton\r\nDohrn was one of Haeckel’s first pupils, and was personally initiated\r\nby him into the study of marine life, at Heligoland in 1865.\r\nZoologists who work in the station to-day find it very comfortable.\r\nLittle steamers with dipping apparatus bring the inhabitants of the\r\nbay to them. There is a large aquarium at hand. You sit down to your\r\nmicroscope, and work. The material is “fresh to hand” every day. There\r\nare now many of these stations at well-exposed spots on the coast in\r\nvarious countries—sea-observatories, as it were, in which the student\r\nexamines his marine objects much as the astronomer observes his\r\nplanets and comets and double stars at night. To-day, when a young man\r\nis taking up zoology, and he is asked what university he is going to,\r\nhe may say that he is going down to the coast, to Naples, to do\r\npractical work. When the long vacation comes, swarms of professors go\r\nfrom the inland towns to one or other seaside place, as far as the\r\npurse will take them. All this is a new thing under the sun. The\r\nzoologist of the olden days sat in his study at home. He caught and\r\nstudied whatever was found in his own district. The rest came by\r\npost—skins, skeletons, amphibians and fishes in spirit, dried insects,\r\nhard shells of crustacea, mussels and snails of all sorts; but only\r\nthe shells always, the hard, dry parts of star-fishes, sea-urchins,\r\ncorals, &c. Animals of the rarest character were thrown away because\r\nthey could not very well be preserved in spirit and sent from the\r\nNorth Sea or the Mediterranean to Professor Dry-as-dust. In this state\r\nof things the advance in microscopic work brought no advantage. But at\r\nlast it dawned on students that the sea is the cradle of the animal\r\nworld. Whole stems of animals flourished there, and there only. Every\r\nwave was full of innumerable microscopic creatures, of the most\r\ninstructive forms. Amongst them were found the young embryonic forms\r\nof familiar animals. At last the cry, “To the sea,” was raised. The\r\nolder professor of zoology had suffered from a kind of hydrophobia. It\r\nwas not possible to teach very much at Berlin about the anatomy,\r\nhistology, and embryology of the sea-urchin from a few dried flinty\r\nshells. At Würtzburg, animals were subtly discussed by men who had\r\nnever made a journey to see them, while they were trampled under foot\r\nevery day by the visitors bathing in Heligoland. They must move. It\r\nwas not necessary to go round the world: a holiday journey to the\r\nNorth Sea or the Mediterranean would suffice. Every cultured man had\r\nalways considered that he must make at least one pilgrimage to classic\r\nlands before his education was complete. It was only a question of\r\nchanging material. They were not to confine themselves to examining\r\nruined temples and aqueducts, but to take their microscopes down to\r\nthe coast, draw a bucketful of sea-water, and examine its living\r\ncontents—the living medusa and sea-urchin, and the living world of the\r\nswarming infusoria. But it was like the rending of the great curtain\r\nof the temple. Zoology seemed to expand ten-fold, a hundred-fold, in a\r\nmoment. A room in an obscure inn by the sea, a microscope, and a\r\ncouple of glasses of salt-water with sediment every morning—and the\r\nfinest studies at Paris and London were as ploughed land, without a\r\nsingle blade, in face of this revelation. It was a Noah’s ark in the\r\nspace of a pinch of snuff.\r\n\r\nOne day the young medical student heard, in the middle of his histology\r\nand zoology, that Kölliker had come back from Messina. He had been\r\nstudying lower marine life there. In 1853, two young men were together\r\nin the Gutenberg forest near Würtzburg. One of them, Karl Gegenbaur, had\r\nbeen abroad with Kölliker. With his impressions still fresh, he tells\r\nHaeckel about his zoological adventures in the land of the Cyclops.\r\n\r\nGegenbaur, eight years older than Haeckel, was by birth and education a\r\ntypical Würtzburger. He, too, had studied medicine, and had practised at\r\nthe hospital. But he had already advanced beyond that. His stay at\r\nMessina had been devoted entirely to zoological purposes. A year later\r\nhe would be teaching anatomy at Würtzburg, and a year later still he\r\nwould be called to Jena. From that time he began to be known as a master\r\nof comparative anatomy—especially after 1859, when his _Elements_ of the\r\nscience was published, a classic in its way that still exercises some\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing romantic in his career, nor could we seek any element\r\nof the kind in a man of Gegenbaur’s character. But his young and\r\nundecided companion seemed to catch sight of a new ideal as he spoke. He\r\nwould complete his medical studies, and then shake himself free of\r\nsurgery and hospital. He would take his microscope down South, where the\r\nsnowy summit of Etna towered above the orange-trees, and study the\r\nbeautiful marine animals by the azure sea and the white houses, in the\r\norange-laden air, and drink in ideas at the magic fount of these\r\nwonderful animal forms, and live out the lusty, golden years of youth on\r\nthe finest coast in Europe. From that moment Haeckel felt a restless\r\ninspiration. He had no idea what it was that he was going to investigate\r\nat Messina; and he certainly did not know when and how he was to get\r\nthere. But he continued his medical studies with a vague hope that it\r\nwas only preliminary work; that some day he would do what his friend\r\nGegenbaur had done.\r\n\r\nThey were very good friends, these two. They were drawn together by the\r\nstrong magnetism of two true natures that understood each other to the\r\ngolden core, though in other respects they were as different as\r\npossible. Gegenbaur was no enthusiast. His ideal was “to keep cool to\r\nthe very heart.” But he was at one with Haeckel in a feeling for a broad\r\noutlook in scientific research. He never shrank from large connections\r\nor vast deductions, as long as they were led up to by a sober and\r\npatient logic. This logical character he afterwards recognised in\r\nDarwin’s idea of evolution, and so the friends once more found\r\nthemselves in agreement, and for a long time they were a pair of real\r\nDarwinian Dioscuri. This feeling for moderation and at the same time for\r\nfar-reaching logic was combined in Gegenbaur with a certain steady and\r\nunerring independence of character. He made little noise, but he never\r\nswerved from his aim. What he accomplished with all these qualities, in\r\nmany other provinces besides Darwinism, cannot be told here. It may be\r\nread in the history of zoology. He had, as far as such a thing was\r\npossible, a restful influence of the most useful character on Haeckel.\r\nIf we imagine what Darwinism would have become in the nineteenth century\r\nin the hands of such men as Gegenbaur, without Haeckel, we can\r\nappreciate the difference in temperament between the two men. With\r\nGegenbaur evolution was always a splendid new technical instrument that\r\nno layman must touch for fear of spoiling it. With Haeckel it became a\r\ndevouring wave, that will one day, perhaps, give its name to the\r\ncentury. In other natures these differences might have led to open\r\nconflict. But Haeckel and Gegenbaur show us that, like so many of our\r\nsupposed “differences,” they can at least live together in perfect\r\naccord in the freshest years of life, each bearing fruit in its kind.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we find Haeckel intimate in this way with Gegenbaur, his senior by\r\neight years, we realise how close he was at that time to the whole of\r\nthe Würtzburg circle. The two generations were not yet sharply divided,\r\nas they subsequently were. Most of them fought either with or against\r\nhim at a later date, but they belonged, at all events, to the same\r\nstratum. But the split between the two generations was felt when one\r\npronounced the name of Johannes Müller, of Berlin—the physiologist (not\r\nthe historian).\r\n\r\nAll who then taught histology, embryology, comparative anatomy, or\r\ncellular pathology at Würtzburg had sat at his feet, either spiritually\r\nor in person. Johannes Müller, born at the beginning of the century, was\r\nappointed Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Berlin the year before\r\nHaeckel was born. That indicates the distance between them. It was in\r\nMüller’s incredibly primitive laboratory that, as Haeckel tells, the\r\ntheory of the animal-cell was established by his assistant, Theodor\r\nSchwann, after Schleiden had proved the vegetal cell. Müller himself had\r\nfounded histology in his own way. He was the real parent of the idea\r\nthat the zoologist ought to go and work by the sea. We have a model of\r\nthis kind of work and at the same time a superb work for embryological\r\nmatters in Müller’s epoch-making _Studies of the Larvæ and Metamorphoses\r\nof the Echinoderms_. He had brought comparative anatomy beyond the stage\r\nof Cuvier, to a point where Gegenbaur could begin. From his school came\r\nRudolf Virchow, who applied the cell-theory to medicine, and Emil du\r\nBois-Reymond, who opened out a new path in physiology by his studies of\r\nanimal electricity. Müller had done pioneer work with remarkable vigour\r\nin all the various branches of research, diverging afterwards to an\r\nenormous extent, that pursue these methods. The many-headed (young and\r\nhalf-young) generation, in which Haeckel was growing, saw the whole\r\nprevious generation embodied in the single name of Müller. He seemed to\r\nbe a kind of scientific Winkelried, except that the fifty spears he bore\r\non his breast were so many lines of progress emanating from him alone.\r\n\r\nJohannes Müller had the great and splendid gift of never lying on the\r\nshoulders of his pupils with an Alpine weight of authority. It was a\r\nsecret of his personality that we admire but can hardly express in words\r\nto-day. Everybody learned from him what a great individuality is. He\r\nexerted a kind of moral suggestion in teaching men to be free, great,\r\nenlightened, and true. His pupils have worked at the development of his\r\nideas with absolute freedom. No part of them was to be regarded as\r\nsacred, and, as a matter of fact, in the chief questions no part has\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nOne approaches the inner life of a man like Müller with a certain\r\ntimidity, and asks how he became what he was. There can be no question\r\nthat the fundamental trait of his character was a peculiarly deep\r\nreligious feeling. At heart he was a mystic. The whole magic of his\r\npersonal influence sprang from these depths. By profession he was a\r\nphysiologist, an exact scientist. Never did he swerve a hair’s breadth\r\nfrom the iron laws of research. But beneath it all was a suppressed glow\r\nof fervour. Every one who understood him, every one who was a true pupil\r\nof his, learned it by a kind of hypnotism. Externally he was all for\r\nlaborious investigation, whether in dissecting a star-fish for you or\r\nclassifying fishes—though he would have a full sense of your ardent\r\nlonging for an inner trust in life and a philosophy of life. Both\r\nelements might change considerably in the pupil: the method of\r\ninvestigation without—the ideal of the comprehensive vision within. But\r\nwhat never left any man who had followed Müller was the warning cry that\r\nthese things, within and without, should go together; that, in the\r\nlarger sense, it is not possible to count the joints in the stalk of an\r\nencrinite without feeling a thrill in the deepest depth of the mind and\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\nIt is so common a spectacle in history for disciples to condemn their\r\nmasters with cold smiles that we forget how pitiful it is. No pupil of\r\nJohannes Müller has ever felt that he had done with him, and might quit\r\nhim with ingratitude. He had pupils, it is true, who did not lack belief\r\nin themselves, and who became famous enough to give them a sense of\r\npower; men who have eventually come to conclusions diametrically opposed\r\nto those that Müller had taught them. Yet they respect him. Living\r\nwitnesses still tell of the glance that bored into you, and could not be\r\nevaded. But there must have been a greater power in the man than this\r\npiercing glance. It was a glance that survived the grave, and laid on\r\none a duty; a glance that shot up in the darkness of memory if the duty\r\nwas not fulfilled—the duty of going to the foundation of things. Whether\r\nyou are examining the larva of an echinoderm or the light of a distant\r\nstar, God is there. Whether you explain your echinoderm-larva in this\r\nway or that; whether you believe your star to be a sun or a burnt-out\r\ncinder; whether you conceive God in this way or another—you shall feel\r\nthat the bridge is there in absolutely everything. Every glance into the\r\nmicroscope is a service of God. It was Goethe’s deepest sun that threw a\r\ngreat, radiant spark out of this curious, dark, angular, unintelligible\r\njewel.\r\n\r\nSuch a man was bound to be more than Kölliker, Virchow, and Gegenbaur to\r\nHaeckel. Müller was still teaching at Berlin, and Haeckel’s best star\r\nbrought him to sit in reality at the feet of the great teacher, who\r\ncould so well speak soul to soul to him.\r\n\r\nAt the Easter of 1854 Haeckel returned from Würtzburg to Berlin. He was\r\nnow twenty years old, and it was at this juncture that, to use his own\r\nphrase, the vast impression of Müller fell on him. A portrait of Müller\r\nstill hangs over the desk in his study in the Zoological Institute at\r\nJena. “If I ever become tired at my work,” he says, “I have only to look\r\nat it to get new strength.” The influence of the much older man, who,\r\nhowever, died at a far earlier age than Haeckel will do, only lasted for\r\na short time. But Haeckel has preserved a memory of him that is only\r\neclipsed by the memory of one other man—Darwin. Müller did not live to\r\nread Darwin’s decisive work, so that these two great ideals of Haeckel’s\r\nnever crossed each other, either for good or evil. He himself felt that\r\nthere was a pure evolution from one to the other in his mind.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1854 he studied comparative anatomy under Müller, for\r\nwhich Kölliker had sufficiently prepared him. He has recorded his first\r\nimpressions. “I soon got to know him personally, but I had so great a\r\nrespect for him that I did not venture to approach him more closely. He\r\ngave me permission to work in the museum. I shall never forget the hours\r\nI spent there, drawing skulls, while he walked up and down, especially\r\non Sunday afternoons. Often when he went past me I wanted to ask him\r\nsomething. I went up the step with beating heart and took hold of the\r\nbell, but returned without venturing to say anything.” Müller took some\r\nnotice of the zealous young student. When the long vacation came round\r\nin August, and the master, following the new custom, packed up his\r\nbundle in order to spend two months on practical work by the sea, he\r\nallowed Haeckel to go with him. Müller’s son and the later Professor La\r\nValette joined the party. They went to Heligoland. Müller taught his\r\npupils his simple method of studying the living subject. There was no\r\nwitchcraft in it, but it had had to be invented by some one. They put\r\nout to sea in a small boat. A little net of linen or fine gauze, with a\r\nwide opening and short body, was fastened on a pole. The mouth of the\r\nnet was thrust directly under the surface or a little deeper, vertically\r\nto the surface, and the boat was slowly rowed forward. The contents of\r\nthe filtered sea-water remained in the meshes of the net, and were from\r\ntime to time emptied into a glass containing sea-water. “I shall never,”\r\nsays Haeckel, “forget the astonishment with which I gazed for the first\r\ntime on the swarm of transparent marine animals that Müller emptied out\r\nof his fine net into the glass vessel; the beautiful medley of graceful\r\nmedusæ and iridescent ctenophores, arrow-like sagittæ and serpent-shaped\r\ntomopteris, the masses of copepods and schizopods, and the marine larvæ\r\nof worms and echinoderms.” Müller called these very fine and generally\r\ntransparent creatures, of whose existence no one hitherto had had any\r\nidea, “pelagic sweepings” (from _pelagos_, the sea). More recently the\r\nword “plancton” (swimming matter) has been substituted for his phrase.\r\nAs we now send whole expeditions over the seas to study “plancton,” the\r\nword has found its way into ordinary literature. The regular anglers who\r\nwere then in Heligoland must have looked on this subtle work with a\r\nbutterfly net as a sort of pleasant joke born from the professional\r\nbrain. The young student must have made an impression on them with his\r\nvigour, though he had not yet turned himself into a marine mammal,\r\nliving half in the water for days together. They called him a\r\n“sea-devil.” What pleased the master most in him was the talent he\r\nalready showed of quickly sketching the tiny, perishable creature from\r\nthe surface of the sea while it was fresh. Haeckel had been passionately\r\nfond of drawing from his early years. Now the old bent agreed with the\r\nnew zeal for zoology. “You will be able to do a great deal,” Müller said\r\nto him. “And when once you are fairly interested in this fairy-land of\r\nthe sea, you will find it difficult to get away from it.” The dream of\r\nMessina, that Gegenbaur had conjured up, seemed to draw nearer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FISHING IN HELIGOLAND IN 1865.\r\n\r\n  Anton Dohrn (Naples). Richard Greeff (Marburg). Ernst Haeckel (Jena).\r\n\r\n  Max Salverda (Utrecht). Pietro Marchi (Florence).\r\n]\r\n\r\nThese lively days at Heligoland provided Haeckel with the material for\r\nhis first little zoological essay. It dealt with the development of the\r\nova of certain fishes (_On the Ova of the Scomberesoces_, published in\r\nMüller’s _Archiv_ for 1855). Müller lent him ova from the Berlin\r\ncollection to complete his study. It is the same volume of the _Archiv_\r\nin which, in Reichert’s introduction, the great controversy breaks out\r\nover Virchow’s pregnant assertion that each human being is a state\r\ncomposed of millions of individual cells.\r\n\r\nHaeckel remained with Müller at Berlin for the whole winter, and was\r\ndrawn more and more into the province of comparative anatomy, or, to\r\nspeak more correctly, zoology. The official Professor of Zoology at\r\nBerlin at the time was really the aged Lichtenstein, who had occupied\r\nthe chair since 1811. Haeckel has humorously described himself in later\r\nyears as self-taught in his own subject, saying that he had attended\r\nmany most excellent colleges, but never visited an official school of\r\nzoology. The only opportunity to do so at the time was under\r\nLichtenstein, but that professor bored him so much that he could not\r\nattend his lectures. Lichtenstein was a venerable representative of the\r\nold type of zoologist; his ideal was to give a careful external\r\ndescription of the species on the strength of specimens chosen from a\r\nwell-stocked museum. A whole world lay between these surviving followers\r\nof Linné and the splendid school of Johannes Müller.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, the fact was that under these alluring attractions\r\nHaeckel’s studies were drifting from the medical profession to an\r\n“impecunious art.” But as medical work had been chosen, if only as a\r\ntemporary occupation, Haeckel had to tear himself away from the great\r\nmagnet, at the Easter of 1855, by removing to a different place. He\r\nchose, as the least intolerable compromise, to return to Würtzburg. At\r\nall events we find him spending three terms there. I have already said\r\nthat Rudolf Virchow was one of the distinguished Würtzburgers at the\r\ntime who sought most keenly the solution of the new problems of biology\r\non the medical side. Hence Virchow had to help him to find the bridge\r\nbetween the work he really loved and the work he was obliged to do. As a\r\nfact, Virchow directed the whole of his studies on this side in the\r\nthree terms.\r\n\r\nVirchow was not so fascinating as Johannes Müller, even in his best\r\nyears. But it was something to be initiated into medical science by such\r\na man. A later generation has, unfortunately, grown accustomed to see\r\nmental antipodes in Virchow and Haeckel. In 1877 they had a controversy\r\nwith regard to the freedom of science that echoed through the whole\r\nworld of thought. Yet seventeen years afterwards Haeckel himself (who\r\nwas first attacked by Virchow), looking back on the days he spent at\r\nWürtzburg, had nothing but grateful recognition to say of Virchow. “I\r\nlearned,” he says in 1894, “in the three terms I spent under Virchow the\r\nart of the finest analytic observation and the most rigorous control of\r\nwhat I observed. I was his assistant for some time, and my notes were\r\nespecially praised by him. But what I chiefly admired in him at\r\nWürtzburg was his wide outlook, the breadth and philosophic character of\r\nhis scientific ideas.”\r\n\r\nThe theory that Virchow put before his pupils was pure Monism, or a\r\nunified conception of the world without any distinction of physical and\r\nmetaphysical. Life was defined, not as a mystic eccentricity in an\r\norderly nature, but plainly as a higher form of the great cosmic\r\nmechanism. Man, the object of medical science, was said to be merely a\r\nhigher vertebrate, subject to the same laws as the rest.\r\n\r\nWe can see very well that this was quite natural. If there was any man\r\nlikely to put forward such views it was Virchow. He had passed through\r\nMüller’s school, but was now one of the younger group who, even during\r\nMüller’s life, were gradually adopting certain very profound views on\r\nlife and man, without any particular resistance on the master’s part.\r\nThe chief characteristic of nearly the whole of this group was the lack\r\nof the volcanic stratum below of deep and personal religious feeling; in\r\nMüller this had been throughout life an enchained Titan among the rocks\r\nof his logical sense of realities, yet it had given a gentle glow and\r\nmovement to the floor of his mind. Rudolf Virchow was the coolest,\r\nboldest, and clearest-minded of the group. He went to the opposite\r\nextreme. If Müller was standing on a volcano, which he only repressed by\r\nthe giant force of his will—a nature that was above all master of\r\nitself—Virchow, on the contrary, was standing on a glacier, and he had\r\nnever taken the trouble to conceal it. I should not venture to count him\r\namongst the instinctively Monistic minds, in the sense of Goethe, to\r\nwhom the unity of God and nature, the inorganic and the organic, the\r\nanimal and the man, comes as an ardent and irresistible feeling. But it\r\nwould have been strange if, in those years and in the middle of the\r\nwhole scientific current of his time, his own organ, his icy logic, had\r\nnot led him to the same conclusion; that it is a simpler method of\r\nresearch to believe in natural law alone, to regard the living merely as\r\na complex play of the same forces that we have in physics and chemistry,\r\nand to consider man, with the bodily frame of an ape-like mammal, to be\r\nreally such an animal. I believe, indeed, that Virchow never abandoned\r\nthis simple solution in his own mind at any part of his career. The\r\ncontroversy he afterwards engaged in ran on different lines. It seems to\r\nme that at an early stage of his development he became convinced that\r\nthere must be limits to scientific inquiry, not on logical, but on\r\ndiplomatic grounds; because it is not an absolute agency, but only a\r\nrelatively small force amongst many more powerful institutions, the\r\nChurch, the State, and so on. Hence it would have to respect limitations\r\nthat were not drawn from its own nature; in given cases it would have to\r\nkeep silent in order not to jeopardise its existence as a whole. It is\r\nmy firm belief that this diplomatic attitude as such would lead to the\r\ndestruction of all pursuit of the truth. It carefully excludes the\r\npossibility of any further martyrdoms, but at the cost of science’s own\r\npower to illumine the world. In my opinion the free investigation of the\r\ntruth is an _absolute_ right. Churches, States, social orders, moral\r\nprecepts, and all that is connected with them, have to adjust themselves\r\nto this investigation, and not the reverse.\r\n\r\nHowever, the point is that under Virchow—more particularly under\r\nVirchow, in fact—Haeckel would be educated into the general attitude\r\nwith regard to God, nature, life, and man, to which he has since devoted\r\nhis whole energy. In spite of Goethe—and who would be likely to take\r\nGoethe as his guide in his twenty-first year?—the ardent young student\r\nwas as yet by no means firmly seated in the saddle. He grubbed, and\r\nsought, and rejected. In his _Riddle of the Universe_ he tells us that\r\nhe “defended the Christian belief in his twenty-first year in lively\r\ndiscussions” with his free-thinking comrades, ... “although the study of\r\nhuman anatomy and physiology, and the comparison of man’s frame with\r\nthat of the other animals, had already greatly enfeebled my faith. I did\r\nnot entirely abandon it, after bitter struggles, until my medical\r\nstudies were completed, and I began to practise. I then came to\r\nunderstand Faust’s saying, ‘The whole sorrow of humanity oppresses me.’\r\nI found no more of the infinite benevolence of a loving father in the\r\nhard school of life than I could see of ‘wise providence’ in the\r\nstruggle for existence.”\r\n\r\nWhen the three terms of medical training were over, he received another\r\nimpulse to his own particular interest in science. Kölliker invited him\r\nin August, 1856, to spend the two months’ holiday with him on the\r\nRiviera. It was the first Mediterranean school of zoology, though as yet\r\nonly a kind of “payment on account.” On the journey he made the\r\nacquaintance of the zoological museum at Turin and its well-travelled\r\ndirector, Filippo de Filippi, and he saw the grandeur of the Maritime\r\nAlps on the Col di Tenda. The master, Kölliker, Heinrich Müller, Karl\r\nKupffer (afterwards professor at Munich), and he established themselves\r\nat Nice, and fished for all sorts of creatures with the Müller-net at\r\nVillefranche. Fortunately, Müller himself happened to be visiting the\r\nRiviera at the same time, and they received a direct stimulus from him.\r\nThe first result of this journey in the summer and autumn was that\r\nHaeckel secured his degree with a zoological-anatomical work, instead of\r\nwith a strictly medical treatise. As he had done from Heligoland two\r\nyears before, he now brought home from the Mediterranean the material\r\nfor a short technical theme. He again spent the winter at Berlin to put\r\nit together. It was an histological study of the tissues of crabs, and\r\ntherefore lay in the province of the articulates, an animal group, it is\r\ncurious to note, which he has not entered into more fully in the course\r\nof his long and varied work as special investigator. At Nice he made a\r\nthorough study of the nerve-tubes of the spiny lobster and other\r\navailable marine crustacea, and discovered several remarkable new\r\nstructural features in them. At Berlin he entered upon a minute\r\nmicroscopic study of the common craw-fish. His dissertation for the\r\ndoctorate embodied the main results of his research. It was entitled _De\r\ntelis quibusdam Astaci fluviatilis_, and was printed in March, 1857. It\r\nappeared the same year in an enlarged form in Müller’s _Archiv_, with\r\nthe title _The Tissues of the Craw-fish_. On March 7th he received his\r\nmedical degree, Ehrenberg, the great authority on the infusoria,\r\npresiding. In the customary way the young doctor had to announce and\r\ndefend several theses. One of them is rather amusing in view of later\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nHe most vigorously contested the possibility of “spontaneous\r\ngeneration.” The meaning of the phrase is that somewhere or at some time\r\na living thing, animal or plant, has arisen, not in the form of a seed\r\nor germ or sprout from a parent living thing, but as a direct\r\ndevelopment out of dead, inorganic matter. Haeckel had not made a\r\npersonal study of the subject. What he said in his thesis was merely a\r\nfaithful repetition of Müller’s opinion. At that time it was believed\r\nthat science had empirically disproved spontaneous generation. An old\r\npopular belief held that fleas and lice were born every day from\r\nnon-living dirt and dust, but that had been refuted long before. No egg,\r\nno animal: every living thing develops from an egg. This had been laid\r\ndown as a fixed rule. When the microscope revealed an endless number of\r\ntiny creatures in every drop of stagnant water, in the air and the dust\r\nand the soil, it was a question whether the rule was not wrong. Surely\r\nthese simplest of all living things, apparently, were born by\r\nspontaneous generation? However, the question was believed to have been\r\nsettled in two ways. Schwann, the co-discoverer of the cell-theory, had\r\nmade certain experiments which seem to prove directly that even these\r\ntiny beings, the infusoria and bacteria, were never formed in a vessel\r\ncontaining water and dead matter, if it had been carefully assured\r\nbeforehand that the minute living germs of these animals that floated in\r\nthe air could not penetrate into the vessel. At the same time Ehrenberg\r\nand others stoutly denied that the infusoria were the “simplest”\r\norganisms, or that they could conceivably be born in that way. They\r\ndeclared that the infusoria were “perfect organisms” in spite of their\r\nsmallness. The belief that these tiny creatures consisted of “one cell,”\r\nand so formed, as it were, the ultimate elements of the plant and animal\r\nworlds on the lines of the cell-theory, was seriously menaced, and\r\napparently on the way to be destroyed. Finally, the tapeworm and similar\r\nparasites had been declared to evolve by a kind of spontaneous\r\ngeneration from the contents of the intestines. But this also was proved\r\nto be untrue. Thus there was ample material for a solid dogma: there was\r\nno such thing as spontaneous generation. The dogma, moreover, harmonised\r\nwith the prevailing belief in a special vital force and a radical\r\ndistinction between the living and the dead, which was still shared in a\r\nsubtle form by even a man like Müller. The dogma was formulated.\r\nSpontaneous generation was struck out of the scientific vocabulary as\r\nunscientific and a popular superstition. The young doctor, duly\r\ninitiated into these ideas of the time, could not resist the temptation\r\nto give his own kick to the fallen theory. Yet how strangely things have\r\nchanged since then! Two years afterwards Haeckel ceased to believe in a\r\nspecial vital force; he was now absolutely convinced that there were\r\nunicellular beings; his whole theory of life seemed to demand\r\nspontaneous generation as a postulate, and he even doubted the force of\r\nthe experiments of Schwann and others. Haeckel himself became the\r\nkeenest apostle of the theory of spontaneous generation. Whenever it is\r\nmentioned to-day, we think of the weight of his name which he has cast\r\nin the scale in its favour. So the leaves change even in the forest of\r\nscience: yesterday green, to-day red and falling, to-morrow green once\r\nmore. On the same branch as the dogmas we find the correctives growing,\r\nthat will at length split them open and cast them as empty husks to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe history of Haeckel’s medical doctorate can be written in a few plain\r\nand touching lines. After receiving his degree he was sent by his\r\nprudent father, to keep him away from crabs and other monsters of the\r\ndeep, to Vienna for a term, to do hospital work under Oppolzer, Skoda,\r\nHebra, and Siegmund. All that we find recorded of this term is that his\r\nold love of botany revived in earnest. Immense quantities of dwarf\r\nAlpine plants were collected. When the traveller passed by the spot\r\ntwenty-four years afterwards on a quiet autumn Sunday, on his way to\r\ntake ship at Trieste for the tropical forests and giant trees of Ceylon,\r\nthe memory of Schneeberg and the Rose-Alp came upon him like a dream.\r\nHowever, the hospital work, together with a short span of cramming in\r\nthe winter at Berlin, must have had some effect, as he passed the\r\nState-examination in medicine. In March, 1858, he was a “practising\r\nphysician.” He had in his hand the crown of prudent ambition—and he felt\r\nlike a poor captive. There was one source of consolation—Johannes\r\nMüller. While one was near him there was a possibility of more real\r\nwork. He discussed with him the plan of the study of the development of\r\nthe gregarinæ (parasitic protozoa), which he wanted to conduct in\r\nMüller’s laboratory in the summer of 1858. Then he was stricken, like so\r\nmany others, with the thunderbolt of the news of Müller’s sudden death,\r\non April 28th of the same year. What must he do now? He began to\r\npractise. It is said on his own authority that he fixed the hours of\r\nconsultation from five to six in the morning! The result was that during\r\na whole year of this philanthropic occupation he had only three\r\npatients, not one of whom died under his earnest attention.\r\n\r\n“This success was enough for my dear father,” says Haeckel. We can well\r\nbelieve it.\r\n\r\nThe kindly old man consented to one more year of quite extravagant\r\nstudy, in which all was to come right. It was to be a year of travel, in\r\nItaly. He was to devote himself to the study of marine animals, not\r\nmerely for pleasure, but earnestly enough for him to find a basis for\r\nhis life in the result. This he succeeded in doing. Like the children of\r\nfortune, who at the very moment when they cannot see a step before them\r\nmake a move that the Philistine regards as the safest and last refuge,\r\nHaeckel becomes engaged that very year to his cousin, Anna Sethe. After\r\nthat, in January, 1859, he goes down to the coast. He makes for the blue\r\nMediterranean, which he already knows will prove anything but an\r\n“unprofitable sea” for him. He will conjure up treasures of science from\r\nits crystal depths with his Müller-net; then on to fortune, position,\r\nmarriage, and the future. The fates have added a world-wide repute, if\r\nthey have denied many a comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                             THE RADIOLARIA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the January of 1859 Haeckel, then in his twenty-fifth year, came to\r\nItaly with the determination “to do it thoroughly.” By the autumn the\r\nbody of the peninsula had been covered down to Naples, Capri, and\r\nIschia. The winter, until April, 1860, was spent at Messina.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of very strenuous students, later Privy Councillors as\r\nwell as archæologists and zoologists, who find a year in Italy a very\r\nsimple matter. They arrive, make the due round of sights, and then at\r\nonce disappear into some library or institute, burying themselves like\r\nmoles in some special work or other, just as they would do at home. The\r\nonly time you can see them is over their Munich beer in the evening; and\r\nif there are a number of them together they smoke their cigars and sing\r\na German student’s song, as they would do at home. These good folk have\r\nvery different dispositions behind their goggles, but they have never\r\nbeen lit up by the fire of Goethe. They are quite content to write home\r\nlike the churlish Herder; Italy is pretty enough in Goethe’s writings,\r\nbut one ought not to go there oneself. The modern scholar of this type\r\nmay add that the cigars are bad and beer dear. Very different was\r\nHaeckel’s verdict. “In Sicily I was nearly thrown out of my line and\r\nmade a landscape-painter.” The æsthetic man in him was the first to lift\r\nup his arms with vigour under this new, free, inspiring sun. His words\r\nare no idle phrase. The moment he tried it Haeckel discovered that he\r\nhad a genius for landscape-painting. Even in regard to this gift we see\r\nthe truth of what I have already said in other connections; the sternest\r\nmaterialists and scientific revolutionaries of the nineteenth century\r\nwere men of considerable artistic power. There was the solid Vogt, a\r\npainter and poet; Moleschott, the soul-comrade of Hermann Hettner;\r\nStrauss, who wrote some poems of great and lasting beauty; Feuerbach,\r\nand others. Even Büchner, the boldest and most advanced of them all, has\r\nwritten poetry under a pseudonym.[1] Darwin took only two books with him\r\nin the little cabin of his ship, Lyell’s _Geology_ and _Paradise Lost_.\r\nThere is a complete gallery of fine water-colours in Haeckel’s house\r\nto-day that have been brought from three quarters of the globe. His son\r\nWalter has inherited the artistic gift, and become a painter. It might\r\nbe said that a good landscape-painter would hardly recompense us for the\r\nloss of the philosopher and scientist that Haeckel became in the\r\nnineteenth century. The simple steel pen, the inspired pencil of the\r\nthinker, did more for humanity in his hand than could have been done by\r\nthe most splendid colour-symphonies of the most inspired\r\nlandscape-painter. I have often thought this as I looked over, in the\r\nevening at Haeckel’s house, the then unpublished treasures of his\r\nartistic faculty. A work like his _History of Creation_ has counted for\r\na stratum in the thought of humanity. What are even the masterpieces of\r\na Hildebrandt in comparison with it! Yet there was undoubtedly the note\r\nof genius in these drawings; some of them showed more than Hildebrandt’s\r\ncleverness (we know to-day that Hildebrandt’s highly coloured pictures\r\ndid not even approximate to the real natural light of southern scenes)\r\nand glow of colour. It seemed to me that here again the man had dreams\r\nof a lost love: a dream of the gay, wandering _pittore_, who asks\r\nnothing but a sunset in violet, carmine, and gold, instead of being the\r\nsober unriddler of the world’s problems. Since that time the house of\r\nFr. Eugen Köhler, to which we owe the fine new edition of Naumann’s\r\nclassic work on birds, with its coloured plates, has undertaken to\r\npublish Haeckel’s water-colours, as “Travel Pictures,” in a splendid and\r\nmonumental work.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Büchner’s brother tells how, when Ludwig furtively brought to him the\r\n  manuscript of _Force and Matter_, he at once guessed it was a romance\r\n  or an epic that so much secret work had been expended on. [Trans.]\r\n\r\nDuring the year in Italy all these gifts were employed together. Italy\r\nwas exactly the land for Haeckel’s temperament, with its mixture of\r\nlofty classic elements and natural beauty and simple, naïve\r\nunpretentiousness. For the first time he felt that he was a cosmopolitan\r\nstudent. He had never been a devotee of the student’s beer-feasts. He\r\nhad no need of alcoholic stimulant. Gegenbaur of Würtzburg, the\r\ninsatiable smoker, once said to him in joke, “If you would only smoke,\r\nwe might make something out of you.” It was done, in any case. His\r\npersonal inclinations were in his favour: an illimitable love of travel,\r\ngood spirits that rose in proportion to the absurdity of his\r\naccommodation, and a simple delight in everything human that enabled him\r\nto talk and travel with the humblest as if they were his equals. He\r\nspent a night with a young worker in a haystack, and when he was asked\r\nwhat he was, he pointed to his paint-box and brush: “House-painter.” “I\r\nthought so when I saw you,” said the youth, and he asked Haeckel to\r\nstart a workshop together with him. Italy was the ideal land for a\r\nvisitor of that type. There was no part of the world from which he was\r\nso pleased to receive recognition in his years of fame as Italy; and he\r\nreceived it in abundance, for the appreciation was mutual.\r\n\r\nI will add a page here that was supplied for the present work by a\r\nfriendly hand, a man who is as well known to thousands as Haeckel\r\nhimself—Hermann Allmers, “the poet of the fens, chief of Frisia, and\r\nsplendid fellow,” as Haeckel has called him. He died in the spring of\r\n1902 at an advanced age. He met Haeckel in Italy, and tells the story in\r\nhis verse and prose. Forty years after their meeting he wrote me that\r\nHaeckel was “the finest man he ever met.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                     “TO ERNST HAECKEL.\r\n\r\n                Dost thou remember the magic night,\r\n                A night I never cease to see,\r\n                That brought us both to Ischia?\r\n                How smooth the boat sailed gently in,\r\n                How silent was the great broad bay\r\n                Unutterably noble and sublime,\r\n                In all its star-lit loveliness,\r\n                As sky and sea met in embrace.\r\n                With fairy-light the waters gleamed\r\n                As helm ploughed gently through the wave,\r\n                And overhead a deep red glow\r\n                Vesuvius from its larva poured.\r\n\r\n                We were yet strangers at the time,\r\n                One hour alone had each the other seen,\r\n                Yet something urged us both to speak—\r\n                To speak, anon, from heart’s great deeps.\r\n                To speak of all we held of worth,\r\n                All that had led us to the spot,\r\n                All the fair gifts of happy fate,\r\n                And the untoward accidents of life;\r\n                Of distant home, of fatherland,\r\n                Of the full days of beauty’s quest.\r\n                Hand clasped in hand we told our joy:\r\n                Need I recall it from the mist?\r\n\r\n                In fine of thy dear love thou told’st\r\n                And sacred silence fell on thee.\r\n                On moved the barque with leisured pace\r\n                Across the deeper silence of the bay.\r\n\r\n                Behind us vanished Posilippo\r\n                And Baja’s gulf and Cape Miseno.\r\n                As Procida passed slowly by\r\n                The gentle dawn stole o’er the night,\r\n                And Epomeo’s head was lit,\r\n                With the first rays of new-born sun,\r\n                And Ischia, nobler than our dreams,\r\n                Uprose before our wondering eyes.\r\n                Above, mantled in its own loveliness,\r\n                Calling us sweetly from the bay\r\n                Up to its gentle, vine-clothed heights,\r\n                Sat radiant Casamicciola.\r\n\r\n                How thou and I the glad days spent\r\n                Thou knowest well. And now?\r\n                Now all is ruin and decay,\r\n                A ghastly tomb. We’ll let it rest.\r\n                Think rather of the linkèd lives\r\n                We spent, and the whole joy of earth,\r\n                That never more will gladden us\r\n                While sun and stars gleam overhead.\r\n                What was it opened then our hearts?\r\n                What was it forged the golden chain?\r\n                It was—thou know’st it well, comrade—\r\n                The sailing on that magic night.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear reader, whenever I let these verses and their splendid truth\r\nvibrate again in my soul—and how often and how gladly I do it!—I have to\r\nsay, Such days thou shalt never know again—such happy entrance into\r\nanother’s heart. And what a heart it was that bared itself to me with\r\nall it hid and would soon reveal! We were in a café at Naples, a copy of\r\nthe _Allgemeine Zeitung_ lying between him and me. It was in the best\r\npart of the spring of 1859. We both reached for it, and told our names,\r\nand the friendship was begun. ‘You must excuse me,’ Haeckel said, ‘I\r\nhave to go to Ischia to-night by the market-boat.’ ‘To Ischia? That’s\r\ngood: I am going there myself. ‘I am very glad, because I heard I was to\r\nbe alone. It starts at nine o’clock.’ That was all that had passed\r\nbetween us before the crossing. What I have described in the above\r\nverses only began when we, the only Germans on board, made ourselves\r\ncomfortable on the open deck. Before the journey was over we were\r\nintimate friends, and have remained friends in joy and sorrow to this\r\nmoment, though the mental differences between us are enormous. However,\r\nCasamicciola brought us together in a wonderful way. We had common\r\nquarters, and always went out together for walks or botanising; we were\r\nnever separated when we painted or drew, as Haeckel did with real\r\npassion. On the third morning, when we found some rare thermal plants in\r\nan almost broiling meadow and discovered nearly at the same spot the\r\nruins of an ancient Roman bath, the remarkable coincidence affected us\r\nso much that we embraced each other joyously and dedicated the rest of\r\nour flask to them. We both felt that we could not do otherwise. So we\r\npleasantly enjoyed the magnificent scene that lay at our feet from the\r\nheight of Epomeo. We stripped off nearly the whole of our clothes, and\r\ndipped, in almost primitive nakedness, in the warm muddy streams that\r\nshot up out of the dark depths under a growth of tendrils and ferns. We\r\nshouted out, ‘How fine it is in these warm and beautifully shaded\r\nbrooks! How delightful it must be in the ravines of Atlas! We must go\r\nthere.’ We spent more than a whole day in the most marvellous ravines of\r\nAtlas, though neither of us had the least idea of them. But we\r\ndetermined to make the journey there, and sketched it out in detail, to\r\nbe undertaken as soon as we left Italy. He contracted a perfect fever\r\nfor travelling. We were four weeks in Pagano’s excellent inn at Capri\r\nwith a few artists, and he completely lost himself with delight. He\r\nbecame intimate with the young artists; being hitherto surrounded by men\r\nof scientific interests, he had avoided them. The intermediary between\r\nHaeckel and them was myself. I liked no one better than genial artists.\r\nNow Haeckel was seized with a passion for painting landscapes day after\r\nday. He was especially interested in the most fantastically shaped\r\nrocks. On the other hand, he neglected his marine animals, and did not\r\nreturn to them entirely until he got to Messina, where he devoted\r\nhimself to the radiolaria, which were destined to play so important a\r\npart in his work. Darwin, who was soon to dominate his whole thought,\r\nhad little significance for him at that time, as the struggle for life\r\nhad not yet been discovered. We rarely spoke of it, but talked\r\nconstantly of Johannes Müller. He was Haeckel’s ideal, as long as I kept\r\nin touch with him. He also spoke often and generously of his university\r\nfriends, Dr. W. D. Focke, who was his special botanical comrade, Dr.\r\nDreyer and Dr. Strube, who were his chief friends at the university at\r\nWürtzburg. The ordinary life and pleasures of the student, and their\r\nheavy beer-drinking, were a torture to him; he avoided them as much as\r\npossible. Very often I could not understand how it was that I brought\r\nhim to the highest pitch of gaiety, whereas on all his earlier travels,\r\nespecially when botany was still his favourite science, he would, after\r\nthe common meal, withdraw quietly with his books and plants to the\r\nsolitude of his own room. Yet he could be the gayest of all. In fact,\r\nhis hearty and wonderful laugh, in all notes up to the very highest,\r\nrings over and over again in the memory of any man who has once heard\r\nit; it is the frank laughter of a glad human heart. And whoever has seen\r\nthe deep earnestness with which the great scientist threw himself into\r\nthe study of the most arduous problems would be astounded to hear it.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Strait of Messina is the pearl of Italy. In my opinion it is finer\r\nthan Naples. The huge volcano and the deep blue strip of water, that\r\nseems to be confined between the white coasts like some fabulous\r\ngiant-stream, give a feeling of sublimity beside which the Bay of Naples\r\nseems but an idyll in the memory. The colours are more vivid; you think\r\nyou would catch hold of the blue bodily if you put your hand in the\r\nwater. It is a land of ancient myths. The Cyclops hammer their work in\r\nEtna. Scylla and Charybdis lurk in the Strait. Once, in the days of\r\nHomer, when the sun of civilisation still lay on a corner of Asia, a dim\r\nMünchhausen-world was lived here, such as we find to-day in the heart of\r\nAfrica or New Guinea. But times changed. Zoologists came and fished with\r\nMüller-nets for tiny transparent sea-creatures in the gentle periodic\r\ncurrents, that may once have given rise to the legend of Scylla and\r\nCharybdis. There is no place more favourable for the purpose than the\r\nharbour of Messina. The basin is open only at one spot, towards the\r\nnorth. The westerly wind is cut off from the town by the mountains, and\r\ncan do no harm. Even the detested southern wind, the sirocco, that\r\nlashes the Strait till it is white with foam, cannot enter. There is\r\nonly the north wind that drives the water into the basin. The waves it\r\nbrings in are full of millions of sea-animals, which accumulate in the\r\n_cul-de-sac_ of the harbour. In fact, if the sirocco has previously been\r\nblowing in the Strait and gathered great swarms of animals from the\r\nsouthern parts at the mouth of the harbour, and then the north wind\r\ndrives them all inside, the whole of the water seems to be alive with\r\nthem. If you dip a glass in it, you do not get water, but a sort of\r\n“animal stew,” the living things making up more of the bulk than the\r\nfluid—little crystalline creatures, medusæ, salpæ, crustacea, vermalia,\r\nand others of many kinds.\r\n\r\nIt was at this classic spot that Haeckel would lay the foundation of his\r\nfame as a zoologist, by the study of a group of minute creatures that\r\nappealed equally to the æsthetic sense by the mysterious beauty of their\r\nforms. There can be little doubt that we can see in this, not only a\r\nfortunate accident, but also the play of some hidden affinity. In such a\r\nspot the artist in Haeckel could compromise with the zoologist. His\r\næsthetic nature had revelled in landscape, peasantry, and song. Now the\r\nMüller-net and the microscope revealed a new world of hidden beauty that\r\nnone had appreciated before him. In devoting himself to it he was still\r\nhalf engrossed in his quest of beauty; but the other half of him was\r\nrapidly attaining a mastery of serious zoology.\r\n\r\nIt is a common belief that æsthetic appreciation ceases as soon as we\r\nsit down to the microscope. There is the magnificent blue Strait of\r\nMessina. Your eye, embracing its whole length, drinks in its beauty in\r\ndeep draughts. What will your microscope make of it? Its field can only\r\ntake in a single drop of water, and this does not grow more blue when\r\nyou thus analyse it. Let science go further afield: this is the land of\r\nbeauty. All those doctrines of histology, embryology, and so on, built\r\non the microscope, are thought to be poles removed from æsthetic\r\nenjoyment. They dissolve everything—man’s soft, white skin, the perfumed\r\nleaf of the rose, the bright wing of the butterfly—into “cells.” It is\r\nmere ignorance to talk in this way. Nature’s beauty is by no means so\r\nthin a covering that the microscope must at once pierce through it.\r\nRather does it reveal to us in incalculable wealth a whole firmament of\r\nnew stars, a new world of beauties, if we choose the right way to see\r\nthem. Haeckel did choose the right way.\r\n\r\nAt his very first dips into the harbour of Messina, in October, 1859, he\r\ngot certain curious lumps and strips of jelly. The local fishermen\r\ncalled them _ovi di mare_ (sea-eggs). It was, in fact, natural enough to\r\nregard these inert creatures as strings of mollusc-eggs, when their real\r\nnature was unknown. But our young student already knew what they were.\r\nThey were social _radiolaria_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A RADIOLARIAN.\r\n  (_Lychnaspis miranda._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe word “radiolarium,” from _radius_ (a ray), means a raying or\r\nradiating animal. It is difficult for the inexpert to imagine the\r\nstructure of one of these creatures. He must first put entirely on one\r\nside all the features that he usually associates with an “animal.” The\r\nradiolarian lives, moves, has sensations, breathes, eats, and\r\nreproduces, but in a totally different way from that we are accustomed\r\nto see. Its body consists essentially of a particle of homogeneous\r\nliving matter. There is merely a firmer nucleus in the centre of it, and\r\nthe soft gelatinous matter is thickened at the surface to form a kind of\r\ncapsule. Otherwise there is no trace of any real “organ.” The little\r\nblob of jelly eats—but it has no stomach; it eats with its whole body,\r\nits soft, jelly-like substance closing entirely over particles of food\r\nand absorbing them. It breathes (with the animal type of\r\nrespiration)—but it has neither lungs nor gills; the whole body takes in\r\noxygen and gives off carbonic acid. It swims about—yet it has neither\r\nlegs nor fins; the pulpy mass of its body flows, when it is necessary,\r\ninto a crown of streamers or loose processes, that keep the body neatly\r\nbalanced; when they are no longer required, they sink back into the\r\ngelatinous mass. We study the “histology” of these curious social-living\r\ncreatures under a powerful microscope. As I have explained, the tissues\r\nand organs of the higher animals break up under the microscope into a\r\nmost ingeniously constructed network of tiny living gelatinous\r\ncorpuscles with a nucleus in the centre—the cells. But our radiolarian\r\nhas no more got tissues composed of cells than it has stomach or lungs\r\nor any other organ. It is merely a single cell with a nucleus and a\r\njelly-like body. Yet in this case the single cell is a whole individual,\r\na complete animal, that lives, moves, eats, breathes, and so on. The\r\nradiolarian is, in comparison with the splendid cell-tapestry of the\r\nhigher animals, a poor little atom of life. It must be put deep down in\r\nthe animal series. What a vast distance! Above is man, built of myriads\r\nof cells woven into the most ingenious tissues and the most perfect\r\norgans for each function of life; below we have the radiolarian, in\r\nwhich a single cell must discharge all the vital functions, because its\r\nwhole body is merely one cell. But there is another wonder. This tiny\r\nparticle of living slime, floating in the blue waves at Messina, hardly\r\nmore visible than a drop of spittle, has a most remarkable quality. It\r\nis able to assimilate a kind of matter that the chemist calls siliceous\r\n(flinty) matter—the stuff that forms, when it is crystallised in\r\nchemical purity, the well-known rock-crystal. This flint matter (and\r\nsometimes a similar substance) is then exuded again by the\r\nradiolarian—no one knows quite how—from its gelatinous body, and built\r\ninto so beautiful a form that even a child will clap its hands and cry,\r\n“How lovely!” when it sees it through the microscope. We may put it that\r\nthe radiolarian forms a coat of mail for itself from this siliceous\r\nmatter: we may at the same time call it a float or buoy. The hard flinty\r\nstructure serves to keep it balanced when it is swimming, just as when a\r\nloose piece of jelly attaches itself to a cork disk. Thus a round\r\ntrellis-work shell is formed about the animal, and through the apertures\r\nit thrusts gelatinous processes that act as oars, and can be put forth\r\nor drawn in at will; outside this shell, again, may be all sorts of\r\nstructures, such as zigzag shaped rods, radiating stars, bundles of\r\nstreamers, and so on. It is a most wonderful sight. It is as if each\r\nclass of these beings had its private taste, and, in virtue of a kind of\r\ntradition, built a different type of flinty skeleton from all the\r\nothers. Here begins the peculiar artistic wizardry of these tiny and\r\nlowly creatures, that lifts them at once high up in the scale of\r\nanimated natural objects with a great display of beauty. We find every\r\npossible variation of ornament within the limits of the particular type:\r\nan infinite number of crystalline and superb variations on the theme of\r\ntrellis-work, stars, radiating shields, crosses, and halberds. They give\r\nan impression at once of human art-work, for there is nothing else in\r\nthe whole of nature with which we may compare them. The radiolarian,\r\ntherefore, is an animal of the utmost simplicity of bodily frame that,\r\nby some force or other, creates the highest and most varied beauty that\r\nwe find anywhere in nature, living or dead, below the level of human\r\nart.\r\n\r\nHaeckel’s good genius brought him to these radiolaria. Until the winter\r\nof 1859-1860 he knew very little about them. When a radiolarian dies its\r\nsoft body naturally melts away and perishes. But the art-work of its\r\nlife, the star or shield of flinty matter, remains; it either sinks to\r\nthe bottom or is washed ashore, where numbers of them may accumulate. If\r\na pinch of mud or sand from the shore is put under the microscope the\r\nobserver will see lovely artistic fragments, and ask what is the meaning\r\nof the miracle. Ehrenberg, the venerable Berlin microscopist, was the\r\nfirst to have the experience. He was not in the habit of going to the\r\nsea himself, but had specimens sent to him, and found in them shells of\r\nthe radiolaria. Though they were so small, their artistic quality seemed\r\nto him to be so great that he assumed they were built by very advanced\r\nanimals of the star-fish or sea-urchin type. That there were unicellular\r\nprotozoa with a simple gelatinous body and no higher organs he stoutly\r\ndenied, and he had the support of his leading contemporaries everywhere.\r\nBut his colleague, Johannes Müller, who fished in the sea himself, came\r\nacross living specimens in the Mediterranean in the first half of the\r\nfifties. It appeared that they were really very lowly animals at least.\r\nMüller christened them the radiolaria, classified the fifty species that\r\nhe discovered, and at his death left the subject well prepared for the\r\nfirst student who should go more fully into it. His final work on them\r\ndid not appear until after his death, in 1858, the sunset-glow of his\r\nbrilliant scientific career. Perhaps he would have gone more deeply into\r\nthe mysteries he had encountered but for a curious accident. Just as he\r\ndiscovered the subject, two years before his death, he had a terrible\r\nexperience. The ship in which he was returning from a holiday in Norway\r\nwas wrecked. A favourite pupil of his was drowned, and he himself\r\nnarrowly escaped by swimming to land. After that he could not be induced\r\nto enter a boat during his last trips to the sea, and so the thorough\r\nstudy of these most graceful inhabitants of the Mediterranean was\r\nabandoned. But when Haeckel fished at Villefranche with Kölliker of\r\nWürtzburg, and Müller was at Nice, he was urged by the master, as a kind\r\nof testamentary injunction, that “something might be done” with the\r\nradiolaria. And when he fished up a pretty crown of socially-united\r\nradiolaria on first rowing over the Messina harbour, he thought it would\r\nbe a grateful offering to the memory of the dead hero of his zoological\r\ndreams to continue the study of the radiolaria. At once he seemed to\r\nenter the treasure-house of a fairy tale. When the campaign was ended in\r\nthe Messina harbour in April, 1860, he had discovered no less than 144\r\nnew species, and each species proved a fresh master of decorative art.\r\nAt the same time he studied the nature of the gelatinous body.\r\nEhrenberg’s theory was destroyed for ever. Granting that there were\r\ncertain difficulties (since explained away) in the way of admitting the\r\nexistence of real unicellular creatures, he at all events gathered an\r\nenormous amount of new and helpful information as to the nature of these\r\nsoft, almost organless beings and of the slimy living matter (called\r\nsarcode or protoplasm) of which they were composed. His mind matured\r\nrapidly in these quiet days at Messina, while his æsthetic nature was\r\nplunged in admiration of the beauty of the siliceous coats. The last\r\nscruple with regard to the old story of creation fell from him like the\r\ncovering of a pupa. If a naked bit of slime like the radiolarian could\r\nform from its body this glorious artistic structure, why may not man\r\nalso, as he paints his pictures under the glow of Italy’s colour, be\r\nmerely a natural being, of like texture to the radiolarian? And if this\r\nradiolarian had in its life built up the crystalline, rhythmic\r\nstructure, why may there not be merely a difference of degree, not of\r\nkind, between the “dead” crystal and the “living” radiolarian?\r\n\r\nIn May, 1860, Haeckel returned from Messina to Berlin. He brought with\r\nhim splendid drawings of the perishable body of his treasures, numbers\r\nof prepared specimens, and whole bottles full of their imperishable\r\nshells. On the 17th of September, 1860, he made the first communication\r\nof his discoveries to his colleagues in the zoological section of the\r\nScientific Congress at Königsberg. Virchow was amongst his admiring\r\naudience. On the 13th and the 20th of December in the same year Peters\r\nread a short account in the Berlin Academy of Science that drew more\r\ngeneral attention. He set to work on a fine monograph, with splendid\r\nplates and with all his conclusions in the text. Before it was finished,\r\nhowever, he had a number of personal experiences and changes of mind.\r\nGegenbaur had in the meantime been appointed Professor of Anatomy at\r\nJena. Before he started for Italy, Haeckel had visited his friend at\r\nJena during the celebration of the third centenary of the university.\r\n“We spent a very happy time there,” Haeckel wrote afterwards, “enjoying\r\nthe beautiful prospect (from the heights of the Saale valley) and the\r\nThuringian beef-sausages.” Now there were more serious things to\r\ndiscuss. Gegenbaur’s lot had once seemed to him a kind of model. Now a\r\npart of it was fulfilled: he had been to Messina. Meantime Gegenbaur had\r\nadvanced a station. Haeckel wanted to follow him, and get a position at\r\nJena. There was no such thing as a professorship of zoology or a\r\nzoological institute there, but all that might—nay, must—be changed some\r\nday. What Gegenbaur was doing left plenty of room for another chair to\r\nbe set up. And to be with his best friend!\r\n\r\nIn March, 1861, Haeckel completed the _Dissertatio pro venia legendi_ at\r\nJena that he had quickly decided on. It dealt, of course, with his new\r\nfield: the limit and the system of the animal group to which the\r\nradiolaria belonged, the rhizopods. He was immediately appointed private\r\nteacher at Jena, and found himself in the lovely valley of the Saale,\r\nbeneath the mountain about whose summit the red rays lingered. He had\r\nbeen drawn from Berlin to Messina to find a home—a home for ever—in the\r\nincreasing stress.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1862, the official position of Extraordinary\r\nProfessor of Zoology was created, and this brought him close, even\r\nexternally, to Gegenbaur. Everything was, it is true, in a very\r\nprimitive condition at first. In August he married Anna Sethe—a sunny\r\ndream of fresh young happiness. In the same year he published his\r\n_Monograph on the Radiolaria_, a huge folio volume with thirty-five\r\nremarkably good copperplates, such as our more rational but slighter\r\ntechnical methods no longer dare produce. Wagenschieber, of Berlin, the\r\nlast of the fine scientific copper etchers, had been in constant\r\npersonal touch with Haeckel, and reproduced his original drawings in\r\nmasterly style. With this work Haeckel was fully established in his\r\nposition as a professional zoologist. It is still one of the finest\r\nmonographs that was issued in the nineteenth century; from the literary\r\npoint of view, also, it was one of the purest and most lucid works of\r\nits kind, full of great and earnest thoughts, and without any\r\nbitterness—a work, perhaps, that Haeckel has not since equalled. The\r\nmost influential and official scientists of the time had to respect this\r\nwork: possibly with the sole exception of the aged Ehrenberg, to whom it\r\ndealt a deadly blow in this department, without, of course, undervaluing\r\nhis great antecedent services. He never even studied it sufficiently to\r\nbe able to quote the title of it correctly.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a flame broke out at one spot in this monograph. In a very\r\nshort time Haeckel’s whole figure would stand out in the red reflection\r\nof its glow—a figure really great, solitary, suddenly deserted by all\r\nthe bewigged and powdered professors—Haeckel himself, as the world has\r\ncome to know him.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                                 DARWIN\r\n\r\n\r\nWe still celebrate, at a distance of centuries, the return of the\r\nbirthday of great men. In reality it is a mistake. We ought to celebrate\r\nthe hour when not merely life, but _the idea of their life_, quickened\r\nthem. That is the really important birth that calls for commemoration.\r\nLuther’s real birthday was when he nailed his theses to the church door.\r\nThen was born the Luther that belongs to the world. Over the\r\nworld-cradle of Columbus shines, not the trivial and evanescent planet\r\ngiven in his horoscope, but the little red flickering star of Guanahani,\r\nthe light that he saw from the shore on the night before he landed on an\r\nisland of the New World.\r\n\r\nLife is a voyage of discovery to the man who passes through it. He looks\r\nout with his child-eyes and discovers the world—at the bottom, discovers\r\nonly himself. But one day a greater veil is torn from before his self.\r\nGenius, the greater I, stirs within him like the butterfly in its narrow\r\npupa-case. For the world at large that is the hour when the _great_ man\r\nis born who will leave his mark on it.\r\n\r\nHaeckel’s biography only begins on a certain day, if we look at it\r\nrightly and broadly. Until that day he is merely a young man, an\r\noutgrowth from a rich old civilisation: a young man who has felt in him\r\na struggle between artistic and scientific tendencies, like so many: who\r\nhas vacillated between the choice of a “paying profession” and research\r\nfor its own sake, and has decided for the former, like so many: who has\r\nchosen zoology, and begun to work hard on professional lines at his\r\nscience: and who has been told prophetically that he will one day do\r\nsomething, though along a line where much has been done already. In the\r\nwhole of this development we have as yet no indication of the real tenor\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\nIt comes first with the name of Darwin. The arabesque of a very\r\ndifferent life begins to blend with that of his own.\r\n\r\nIn the February of the year in which Haeckel was born (1834),\r\ntwenty-eight years before the point we have arrived at, Charles Darwin\r\nwas on a scientific expedition to South America. There is a romantic\r\nelement in the earlier story of this journey. The naked Fuegians had\r\nstolen a boat from an English Government ship that was engaged in making\r\ngeographical measurements, towards the close of the twenties, on the\r\nwild coast of Tierra del Fuego. FitzRoy, the captain, arrested a few of\r\nthe natives, brought them on board as hostages, and in the end took them\r\nwith him to England. They were to be instructed in morality and\r\nChristianity and then taken back to their people, in order to introduce\r\nthese elements of civilisation, for the advantage of shipwrecked sailors\r\nor distressed travellers who might fall in with them. We feel a breath\r\nof the spirit of Rousseau in it. As a fact nothing came of the device.\r\nThe good Fuegians were clothed and improved by civilised folk for a year\r\nor two, returned home, immediately abandoned their trousers and their\r\nChristianity, and remained naked savages. But the bringing home of these\r\nhostages led, in the early thirties, to a new expedition of FitzRoy to\r\nTierra del Fuego. The Government directed him to draw up further charts,\r\nand he looked about for a man of science to accompany him.\r\n\r\nThe man proved to be Charles Darwin, then in his twenty-second year.\r\n\r\nThe son of a prosperous provincial physician, he had begun to study\r\nmedicine without much success, and was transferred to theology, only to\r\nfind after three years of study that he was as little fitted to become a\r\ncountry clergyman as a country doctor. He had an unconquerable love of\r\nscientific investigation. He collected all kinds of things, and desired\r\nto travel, without any very clear idea of his destiny. A chance\r\nintroduction came to the young man as a godsend, and he joined FitzRoy’s\r\nexpedition to South America. Once more, it was this journey that made\r\nhim “Darwin,” the mighty intellectual force in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nDarwin found an idea in South America. You have to examine it very\r\nclosely to appreciate it clearly. Let us recapitulate very briefly the\r\nhundred years of zoology and botany that had gone before.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century Linné drew up, for the first time, a great\r\ncatalogue of plant and animal species. Each species had a solid Latin\r\nname, and was provided with its particular label, by which every\r\nrepresentative of the species could be recognised at once. Then the\r\nspecies were bracketed together in larger groups, and a general system\r\nwas formed. It was an immense scientific advance, and is still generally\r\nappreciated as such. But we have to make one reserve. It is not man that\r\nseparates things; nature, or rather God who created nature, has already\r\ndistinguished them. In this respect zoology and botany are of God. The\r\nvarious species of plants and animals are something firmly established\r\nby God. Take the polar bear, the hippopotamus, the giraffe, or a\r\nparticular species of palm, or vine, or rose. There they are, and all\r\nthat man has to do is to learn their specific characters in order to\r\ndetermine and name them.\r\n\r\nBehind all this we really have the ancient idea of the Mosaic story of\r\ncreation. God made the animals and plants, species by species, put them\r\nin their places, and said to man, “Name them as you think fit, classify\r\nthem, putting the like together and separating the unlike.” So God spake\r\nto Adam when he stood before him, naked as a Fuegian. Linné comes on the\r\nscene some six thousand years afterwards to set about this naming and\r\narranging in earnest. But that does not make much difference. There are\r\nthe species created by God. They have ceaselessly reproduced themselves\r\nsince the days of Paradise according to the command to increase and\r\nmultiply, each one in its own kind, so that the polar bear has only\r\nbegotten polar bears, the giraffe giraffes, the hippopotamus\r\nhippopotami. Thus, in spite of death, the primitive Paradise is still\r\nthere, and Linné, the official professor at Upsala, with his venerable\r\nwig and embroidered coat, can take up the work of the naked Adam with a\r\ngood conscience, and finish what the patriarch had not been able to do.\r\n\r\nLinné died in 1778 (about the time when Goethe was beginning the\r\n_Iphigenia_ and _Wilhelm Meister_) in the full fame of all these\r\nachievements and all his hypotheses from the giraffe to God. Fifty years\r\nelapsed between this and Darwin’s voyage; but in those fifty years the\r\nfollowing process is accomplished:—\r\n\r\nAn increasing number of bones and other relics of animal species, that\r\nexist no longer, were dug out of the earth. In South America the\r\nskeleton was found of a giant-sloth, the megatherium, the remains of a\r\nkind of animal, larger than the elephant, that no traveller could find\r\nliving in the country. The famous mammoth-corpse came to light in the\r\nice of Siberia; an entirely strange elephant with curved tusks and a red\r\nwoolly coat. Ichthyosauri were found in the rocks in England, and so on.\r\nAll these “extinct” species had to be named and arranged in the system.\r\nA special scientific indication was put on them, which means “extinct.”\r\nBut this was not enough for thought—which cannot be “entirely dispensed\r\nwith,” as some one well said, even in exact science.\r\n\r\nWhere did these extinct species come from? What is their relation to the\r\nCreator? Were they created long ago in Paradise with the others, and\r\nafterwards conveyed in the ark, only to disappear in the course of time?\r\nAnd what was the cause of their disappearance? Must we conclude that\r\npart of what Adam saw was not available for Linné and his pupils? These\r\nfour remains, a few bones here and there, do not tell us much about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTherefore, species may perish: many of them have perished.\r\n\r\nThere was something new in this, something that obscured the clear lines\r\nof earlier science. However, a way of escape was found. It was claimed\r\nthat these grotesque monsters—ichthyosauri, megatheria, mammoths,\r\n&c.—represent an earlier creation, with which Adam had nothing to do.\r\nCuvier developed the theory in his grandiose way in 1812. Before the\r\ncreation of the animal and plant species that Adam found in Paradise\r\nthere was a long series of periods in the history of the earth, each of\r\nwhich had its own animal and plant population. It was in one of these\r\nperiods that the forests grew which we find fossilised in our coal. In\r\nanother the ichthyosauri, gigantic lizards, filled the ocean. In a third\r\nthe hideous megatherium dragged along its huge frame, and so on. It is\r\ntrue that there is nothing in the Bible about these ancient and extinct\r\nperiods; but the Mosaic verses move quickly—they press on to come to\r\nman. The repeated creations of the animal and plant worlds are summed up\r\nin a single one. We must read something between the lines.\r\n\r\nApart from that, everything is clear. Hence the ancient species were\r\nmade fixed, solid, and unchangeable by God just like the later species\r\nthat Adam found in Paradise, and that still exist. Without the will of\r\nGod they could no more have died out than the actual ones; and there\r\nwere no human beings there to destroy them. But the divine action\r\nintervened. At the end of each of these old-world periods a terrible\r\nspectacle was witnessed. The heavens poured out their punishing floods;\r\nthe seas were heated to steam by fiery masses of rock that were summoned\r\nby the divine power from the bowels of the earth. In the course of a\r\nsingle day the carboniferous forests were swallowed up; the megatheria\r\ndisappeared, legs uppermost, like flies in butter, in the sand dunes of\r\nthe terrible floods.\r\n\r\nThe might of the creative act was equalled by the might of the\r\ndestruction. The science of these vast new creations and divine\r\nrevolutions before Adam’s birth was called geology. It lived in peace\r\nwith Linné’s theory of fixed species. Its parent, Cuvier, was so great a\r\ngenius that it seemed quite impossible that he had made a mistake.\r\nBefore twenty years were out he was, in the opinion of a contemporary\r\nand equally able geologist, declared to be certainly wrong on one point.\r\n\r\nLyell wrote a magnificent work in which he proved, from the point of\r\nview of scientific geology, that the whole story of these terrible\r\nrevolutions was a fiction. There are no such sharp sections in the early\r\nhistory of the earth. Everything goes to show that throughout the whole\r\nperiod of the earth’s development the same natural laws have been at\r\nwork as we find to-day. It is true that the relative positions of sea\r\nand land, hill and valley, forest and desert, have often changed; but\r\nvery, very slowly, in the course of millions of years. A single drop of\r\nwater, constantly falling, will hollow out a stone. In these millions of\r\nyears the water has swept away rocks here, and formed new land by the\r\naccumulation of sand there. In these millions of years the sand has been\r\ncompressed into the gigantic masses that tower above us to-day as\r\nsandstone mountains; they are formed of sand that was originally laid\r\nlike mud, layer by layer, on the floor of the ocean.\r\n\r\nIt was all very plausible; it seemed to picture an eternal flow of\r\nthings in which there was no room for God. The changes in the earth’s\r\nsurface were easily brought about without catastrophes, in the course of\r\nincalculable ages. God was excluded from geological discussions of the\r\nformation of hill and dale. And when it was fully realised, it brought\r\nthe question of species to the front once more.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to retreat simply to Linné’s position. Lyell by no\r\nmeans denied Cuvier’s various periods in the earth’s development as\r\nsuch. He believed, moreover, that the plant and animal populations were\r\ndifferent in these epochs. When the forests flourished which have formed\r\nthe mass of our coal-measures there were no ichthyosauri; when the\r\nichthyosauri came there were no longer any carboniferous forests; with\r\nthe ichthyosauri there were no megatheria, and the last ichthyosaurus\r\nwas extinct before the megatheria arrived. All that Lyell rejected was\r\nthe great divine catastrophes. But when these were abandoned, it was no\r\nlonger possible to attribute the “end” of the extinct species to a\r\ndivine act. We were faced with the slow and natural conversion of\r\nterrestrial things in the course of endless ages.\r\n\r\nSpecies must have been liable to be destroyed by purely natural causes.\r\nThe catastrophes were abandoned, yet species _had_ been destroyed. And\r\nwhen that was granted—it was the devil’s little finger—a further\r\nconclusion was inevitable. If species have died out slowly and naturally\r\nin the history of the earth, and new species have made their appearance\r\nat the same time, may not these new species have _arisen_ slowly and\r\nnaturally? Suppose these simple and purely natural causes, that had\r\nbrought about the extinction of certain species, had been for others the\r\nvery starting-point of development? In one word: if the extinction was\r\nnot due to a mighty divine interference, was it not conceivable that the\r\norigin also may not have needed such?\r\n\r\nOne more deduction, and the demon of knowledge had hold of the entire\r\nhand. May not this natural extinction and natural new-birth have been\r\ndirectly connected in many cases? As a fact, some of the species had\r\nbeen wholly extirpated. But others had provided the living material of\r\nthe new arrivals; they had been _transformed_ into these apparently new\r\nspecies. That was the decisive deduction. It did away with the need of\r\nany sudden creation. It merely made a claim that was appalling to the\r\nLinnean principles: namely, that species may change. In the course of\r\ntime and at a favourable spot one species may be transformed into\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAnother fairly obvious deduction could be made. Who brought about the\r\ntransformation? Lyell proved that, without any catastrophes, terrestrial\r\nthings are constantly changing—the water and the land, the mountains and\r\nthe valleys, and even the climate. In this gradual change the\r\nenvironments of living things were at length altered to such an extent\r\nthat they were bound to cause a change in the organisms. However,\r\ndifferent species reacted in different ways. Some gradually died out.\r\nOthers adapted themselves to the new conditions; just as, in human\r\naffairs, one race breaks down under changed conditions while another\r\nrises to a higher and richer and new stage on that very account. No\r\ncreation! Merely transformations of species, development of new forms\r\nfrom older ones by adaptation to new, naturally modified conditions.\r\nEven zoology and botany were without the finger of God from the earliest\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nOf course there was no trace of these latter deductions in Lyell. But\r\nthey pressed themselves with an irresistible and decisive force on the\r\nmind of one of his first readers, Darwin.\r\n\r\nHe took Lyell’s book with him to South America. Step by step the logic\r\nof it forced him to admit that this was what must have taken place\r\nsomewhere. First the idea of “extinct species” became a concrete picture\r\nto him there, a sort of diabolic vision. The whole substratum of the\r\npampas is one colossal tomb of strange monsters. The bones lie bare at\r\nevery outcrop. Megatheria, or giant-sloths, as large as elephants, and\r\nwith thighbones three times as thick as that of the elephant, able to\r\nbreak off branches in the primitive forests with their paws: armadilloes\r\nas big as rhinoceroses, with coats as hard as stone and curved like\r\nbarrels; gigantic llamas, the macrouchenias, compared with which the\r\nmodern specimens are Liliputians; mastodons and wild horses, of which\r\nAmerica was entirely free even in the days of Columbus, and lion-like\r\ncarnivores with terrible sabre-teeth. There they all are to-day—extinct,\r\nlost, buried in the deserted cemetery of the pampas-loam.\r\n\r\nWhen the young Darwin stood by these groves, like Hamlet, he did not\r\nknow how closely this ghost-world came to our own day. At that time the\r\narmour of the gigantic armadillo, the glyptodon, that had formed\r\nshelters over the heads of the human dwellers in the pampas, like\r\nEsquimaux huts, had not yet been discovered. The cave of Ultima\r\nEsperanza in Patagonia had not been searched, and no one had seen the\r\nred-haired coat of the sloth as large as an ox, the gryptotherium (a\r\nrelative of the real megatherium), cut by some prehistoric human hand,\r\namongst a heap, several yards deep, of the animal’s manure—in such\r\npeculiar circumstances as to prompt the suggestion that the giant-sloths\r\nhad been kept tame in the cavern, as in a cyclopean stable, by\r\nprehistoric Indians. Darwin thought the remains were very old, though\r\nthis by no means lessened the inspiration.\r\n\r\nAs our geological Hamlet speculated over these bones of extinct\r\nmonsters, the ideas of Linné and Cuvier struggled fiercely in his mind\r\nwith the new, heretical ideas inspired by Lyell. How was it that these\r\nancient, extinct animal forms of America resembled in every detail and\r\nin the most marked characteristics certain living American animals?\r\nBefore him were the relics of past sloths, armadilloes, and\r\ngiant-llamas. In the actual America, also, there were sloths,\r\narmadilloes, and llamas, though with some difference. And nowhere else\r\non earth, either in past or present time, were there sloths,\r\narmadilloes, and llamas. Cuvier had replied, God had pleased to create\r\nthose ancient megatheria, glyptodons, and macrouchenias of America.\r\nThen, one day, he sent his destructive catastrophe, and swept them all\r\naway, as a sponge goes over the table. Then, in the empty land, he\r\ncreated afresh the sloths, armadilloes, and llamas of to-day. But why\r\nhad God made the new animals so like the old that the modern zoologist\r\nhas to class the megatherium in the same narrow group as the actual\r\nsloth, the ancient glyptodon with the modern armadillo, and so on?\r\n\r\nDarwin, who had studied theology, was unshaken with regard to God\r\nhimself. However, something occurred that occurs so often and with such\r\ngood result in the history of thought. It appeared to him that the\r\nnotion of a direct creation is by no means the simplest way of\r\nexplaining things, but the most puzzling and complicated. Darwin\r\nbelieved in Lyell. There had been no destructive catastrophe at all to\r\nsweep away the megatherium and its companions. They had disappeared\r\ngradually, by natural means. Was it not much more rational to suppose\r\nthat the actual sloths and armadilloes came into being gradually, by\r\nnatural means? Part of the old animal population had not perished, but\r\nbeen transformed into the actual species. There was a bond of\r\nrelationship between the past and the present. One or other grotesque\r\nand perhaps helpless giant form may have completely disappeared in the\r\ncourse of time. But the golden thread of life was never entirely broken.\r\nOther and more fortunate species had preserved the type of the sloth,\r\nthe armadillo, and the llama; they had developed naturally into the\r\nliving animals of America. God might remain at the groundwork of things.\r\nHe had launched matter into space, and impressed natural laws on it. But\r\nthese sufficed for the further work. They created America. They\r\ndeveloped the mammal into the sloth and the armadillo in the days of the\r\nmegatherium and the glyptodon. They maintained these types in the\r\ncountry, in a straight line of development; the progressive principle of\r\nlife bringing about the extinction of certain forms, and transforming\r\nothers by a more fitting adaptation to their environment.\r\n\r\nDarwin always looked back on this first conflict of his ideas in\r\npresence of the dead shells and bones of the ancient pampas animals as\r\nan hour of awakening. It was the birth of his humanity in the higher\r\nsense. It is of interest to us because it coincides exactly with the\r\ndate of Haeckel’s birth in the ordinary sense.\r\n\r\nIn Darwin’s fine account of his voyage, which is mostly arranged in the\r\nform of a diary, we find a passage written on the east coast of\r\nPatagonia on January 9, 1834, and the next on April 13th. In the\r\nmeantime the ship had made a short zigzag course, which is spoken of in\r\nanother connection. But the interval between the two dates is taken up\r\nwith a passage on these gigantic animals, the reasons for their\r\nextinction and the striking fact of their bodily resemblance to the\r\nliving animals of South America. “This remarkable resemblance,” we read,\r\n“between the dead and the living animals of one and the same continent\r\nwill yet, I doubt not, throw more light on the appearance of organic\r\nbeings on the earth than any other class of facts.” This is clearly a\r\nsummary of Darwin’s deepest thoughts at the time. Haeckel was born on\r\nFebruary 16th of the same year, 1834. Thus the bodily birth of one of\r\nthe two men whom we conceive to-day as Dioscuri coincides with the\r\nspiritual rebirth of the other. But it would be nearly thirty years\r\nbefore they would meet in spirit never to part again. At the very\r\nbeginning of their acquaintance Darwin wrote a letter to Haeckel\r\n(October 8, 1864) in which he speaks of the earliest suggestions of his\r\ntheory. The Hamlet-hour comes back vividly to his memory. “I shall never\r\nforget my astonishment when I dug out a gigantic piece of armour, like\r\nthat of a living armadillo. As I reflected on these facts and compared\r\nothers of a like nature, it seemed to me probable that closely related\r\nspecies may have descended from a common ancestor.”\r\n\r\nHowever we take it, Darwin then saw for the first time that his\r\ndifficulty about the mutability of species was from the first, in his\r\nown mind, a difficulty about God. He began his doubts with the ancient\r\narmadillo; he ended with God.\r\n\r\nOn the return journey from South America, which amounted to a\r\ncircumnavigation of the globe, the struggle was renewed at the Galapagos\r\nislands. Volcanic forces had raised these islands from the bed of the\r\nocean in comparatively recent times. They were, therefore, bound to be a\r\nvirgin province at the time. Now, however, the walls of the crater were\r\nclothed with vegetation, birds flew after insects, and gigantic turtles\r\nand lizards lived on the shores. Whence did these plants and animals\r\ncome? Darwin examines them. They have an unusual appearance, and seem to\r\npoint to America. Yet not a single species is now wholly American; each\r\nhas its peculiarities. An historical controversy arises over the\r\nislands, and men range themselves in parties once more. Empty islands\r\nemerge from the blue waters. How are they to be populated? There are two\r\npossibilities. One is that God has created the animals and\r\nplants—Galapagos animals and plants. But in that case why has he created\r\nthem entirely on the American model, while diverging from it in small\r\ndetails? The second possibility is that the animals and plants were\r\nbrought by the current or the wind from the neighbouring American coast;\r\nthey are American plants and animals. After landing on the islands, they\r\nadapted themselves to their new surroundings, and were altered. Hence\r\nboth the resemblance and the difference. The theory assumes, of course,\r\nthat species are mutable. If that is so, we can explain\r\neverything—without God.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest and tensest struggle began when Darwin returned home.\r\nHe approached the most audacious, but most striking fact, for his\r\npurpose. Up to this the question had been whether new species were\r\nproduced by God or by natural necessity. Now a third element was\r\nintroduced, man himself. He also alters species, as a breeder of\r\npigeons, rabbits, sheep. He has done it with success for ages—only the\r\nLinnés and Cuviers had not noticed the fact. How does he accomplish it?\r\n\r\nA breeder desires to give his sheep finer wool. He examines the wool of\r\na thousand sheep. The difference between them is so slight that it is of\r\nno practical consequence. But the farmer selects the male sheep out of\r\nthe thousand that has the best quality of wool, and the corresponding\r\nfemale. He crosses the two. Their young have wool of a slightly improved\r\nquality, and he picks out the best amongst them once more for crossing.\r\nHe continues this through several generations. At last, with his\r\ncontinuous selection and crossing, the quality of the wool increases so\r\nmuch that any one can recognise it at once, and it has a distinct\r\ncultural value. In this way improved races of animals and large numbers\r\nof fine flowers have been produced by breeders: by artificial selection\r\nof the fittest to reproduce in each generation. This was done by man—not\r\nby God, not by nature in remote times, but under our very eyes, by man.\r\n\r\nNow for an analogous process without man. Let our sheep live wild in any\r\ncountry. No human breeder has any interest in them: God does not seem to\r\ninterfere with them. They live on and on, for thousands of years,\r\ngeneration after generation. Here again, in the wild state, we find the\r\nsame slight variations in the quality of the wool. One sheep has a\r\nthicker coat than another. For thousands of years the fact is without\r\nsignificance. Then occurs a slow change of the environment. The climate\r\nbecomes colder. Perhaps an ice-age sets in, such as our earth seems to\r\nhave passed through many times. There are two alternatives. A very hard\r\nwinter may set in at once and all the sheep perish, because their woolly\r\ncoat is too thin in all cases. That would mean the extinction of a whole\r\nspecies. But the severe cold may come on gradually. The winters are more\r\ntrying. So many sheep perish in the first winters; but so many others\r\nsurvive. Which will survive? Naturally, those that happened to have the\r\nthicker coats. Those alone live on to the spring, and reproduce. The\r\nfollowing year the coat is thicker all round, as the lambs all came from\r\nrelatively thick-coated parents. The winter decimates them again, and\r\nthe thickest coated survive once more, and so on. The pressure of\r\nexternal conditions, the “struggle for life,” selects just as man does.\r\nOnly the best adapted individuals survive and reproduce.\r\n\r\nThe whole earth is a vast field of splendid adaptations. The tree-frogs\r\nare green because only green frogs are preserved; all the others are\r\ndestroyed. The arctic hare is white on the snow, the desert-fox yellow.\r\nFor a thousand reasons in the course of the earth’s development these\r\nbackgrounds—white, yellow, green; snow, desert, forest, &c.—have\r\nthemselves been constantly changing under the action of Lyell’s changes\r\nin the crust of the earth. Hence constantly fresh adaptations, with a\r\ncertain percentage of complete extinctions. In these ceaseless new\r\nadaptations we see a picture of an eternal progressive development.\r\nAlways a finer selection: always better material: natural things always\r\nselecting and being selected. Man is superfluous in this world-old,\r\neternal process. And God, too, is superfluous.\r\n\r\nThat was Darwin’s last and decisive thought. Divine action was excluded\r\nfrom the whole province of animal and plant species. It does not matter\r\nwhether or no the shrewd idea of natural selection solves the whole\r\nproblem. Why speak of “whole,” when all problems are really\r\nunfathomable? He left open the question of the origin of the first\r\nslight variations, the first increase in the fineness or thickness of\r\nthe sheep’s wool, for instance. He left open the question of the inner\r\nnature of the process—and a good deal more. But these things did not\r\naffect the great issue.\r\n\r\nWhat Darwin did was to show for the first time how we might conceive the\r\nnatural evolution of species; to suggest that the miracle of the\r\npurposive adaptation of organisms to their environment could be\r\nexplained by purely natural causes without introducing teleological and\r\nsupernatural agencies to bring the disharmony into harmony. The older\r\nmind and logic had seen the action of God everywhere; the new thought\r\nand logic were gradually restricting his sphere. Darwin took away a\r\nwhole province from the teleologist when he merely set up the idea of\r\nselection. He towered above himself in that moment. Natural philosophy\r\nwrested zoology and botany from the hands of Linné and Cuvier. It\r\ndestroyed the old idea of a design in the interest of natural law and\r\nthe general unity of nature. “Allah need create no more.” We cannot\r\nemphasise it too much: it was the conceivability that settled the\r\nquestion. Darwin had shown that “it might have been so,” and this\r\npossibility stood for the first time in zoology and botany opposed, with\r\nall the weight of logic, to the other theory, which was no more\r\nunderstood, but was supplied by imagination to fill a gap—the idea of a\r\nspecial creation of each animal species, the idea that the green\r\ntree-frog, had been created amongst the foliage just as he was. The\r\nfeebler fancy gave way to the better. In this concession lay whole\r\nsciences that would have to be entirely transformed on the strength of\r\nDarwin’s achievement.\r\n\r\nNarrow-minded folk have tried to make light of the mere “possibility,”\r\ncreating a distinction between truth and logical theory. As if all truth\r\nwere not solely in the human mind! What an age can conceive is true to\r\nthat age. There is nothing higher in the bounds of time and the\r\ndevelopment in which we are involved. All truth and science began for\r\nhumanity in the form of possibilities. Copernicus’s theory was only a\r\npossibility when it first came. All that we call human culture has come\r\nof the putting together of thousands upon thousands of these\r\npossibilities, like so many stones. It is no use raising up against it\r\nthe figment of “absolute truth.” The main point was that Darwin raised\r\nthe conceivability of a natural origin of species by the modification of\r\nolder forms, which were driven ceaselessly to new adaptations under the\r\nstress of the struggle for life, to such a pitch that the older\r\npossibility of a creation of each species and its deliberate adaptation\r\nby supernatural action sank lower and lower. It was a pure conflict of\r\nideas; the greater overcame the smaller—_now_ smaller.\r\n\r\nDarwin’s work, the _Origin of Species_, was published on November 24,\r\n1859, after twenty-five years of study. He kept the theory of selection\r\nto himself for more than twenty years. The whole of the young generation\r\nfrom the beginning of the thirties, to which Haeckel belonged, grew up\r\nwithout any suspicion of it. Apart from the constant ill-health that\r\nhindered his work, Darwin was tortured with anxiety lest he should be\r\ntreated as an imaginative _dilettante_ with his heretical ideas. In the\r\nscientific circles of the middle of the century one was apt to be\r\ndisdainfully put down as a windy “natural philosopher” if one spoke of\r\n“the evolution of animal and plant species” and the like. The word had\r\nbecome the scarecrow of the exact, professional scientific workers; much\r\nas when commercial men exclaim, “Dear me, the man’s a poet.” Hence\r\nDarwin wanted to provide a most solid foundation of research for his\r\nwork, and then to smuggle it into the house like a goblin in a jar.\r\n\r\nHe took his task so seriously that, as Lyell afterwards wrote to him, he\r\nmight have worked on until his hundredth year without ever being ready\r\nin the sense he wished. Chance had to intervene, and bring forward one\r\nof the younger men, who almost robbed him of the title of discoverer.\r\nWallace arrived independently at the idea of selection, and he was\r\nwithin a hair’s breadth of being the first to publish it. The aged\r\nscholar at Down had to come forward. Then the great book was published,\r\nand Wallace disappeared in its shadow.\r\n\r\nIn Darwin’s opinion it was only a preliminary extract, and he added many\r\nsupplementary volumes as time went on. As a fact it was so severely\r\nelaborated that even the thoughtful layman, possibly with a sympathy for\r\nthe idea, was almost, if not wholly, unable to digest the proofs. It had\r\nto be “translated” for the majority of Darwin’s educated countrymen. On\r\nthe other hand, this mass of facts was partly strange and new to the\r\nprofessional biologists. What did so many of the museum-zoologists know,\r\nfor instance, of the results and problems of the practical breeder?\r\n“That belongs to the province of my colleague who teaches agriculture,\r\nnot to mine.” His proofs were taken indiscriminately from zoology,\r\nbotany, and geology. But at that time it was woe to the man that mixed\r\nup the various branches of research. The professor of zoology could not\r\ncontrol the botanical material, and _vice versâ_. There was, in\r\naddition, the general dislike of the natural-philosophical nucleus. It\r\nwas impossible to suppose that this very individual book, transgressing\r\nevery rule, should at once meet with wide encouragement, or even\r\nordinary appreciation.\r\n\r\nIn England Darwin’s repute as a traveller and geologist, and the\r\npersonal respect felt for him, had some effect. Then came a small circle\r\nof friends, Hooker, Huxley, even, to some extent, the aged Lyell, who\r\nhad seen the manuscript before publication, and had at once started a\r\nmore or less brisk propaganda. In the first six months three editions of\r\nthe work were sold, so that it was read by a few thousand men. As a rule\r\nthere was at that time less dread of “natural philosophy” in England\r\nthan elsewhere. But pious minds were alarmed at the “struggle against\r\nGod” that was based on the exact data of zoology, botany, and geology.\r\n\r\nDarwin had made that the salient point, as a glance at the work shows,\r\nsince he closes with a reference to the Deity. He said it was a “grand”\r\nview of the Creator to suppose that he had created only the first forms\r\nof life on the earth, and then left it to natural laws to develop these\r\ngerms into the various species of animals and plants. It was prudent to\r\nrestrict the theistic conflict. God was merely excluded from the origin\r\nof species. Natural selection did not apply to the further problem of\r\nthe origin of the primitive life-forms and of life itself. Theism could\r\nretain them. There was something soothing psychologically in the phrase,\r\nwhich was often attacked subsequently, and did not represent Darwin’s\r\nlater views. It was characteristic of Darwin’s gentle disposition.\r\n\r\nHe did not start out from the position that God does not exist, and that\r\nwe must, at all costs, seek natural causes for the origin of things. He\r\nhad not abandoned the idea of the clerical profession because he had\r\nlost belief in God, but because he had more attraction for catching\r\nbutterflies and shooting birds. Still a firm theist, he had been\r\nconvinced, as a candid geologist, by Lyell’s demonstration that God had\r\nhad nothing to do with the moulding of hill and valley or the\r\ndistribution of land and water. As a candid zoologist and botanist he\r\nhad then convinced himself that the analogous changes in the animal and\r\nplant worlds had needed no divine intervention.\r\n\r\nAs yet, however, he saw no reason to draw more radical conclusions. He\r\nsought, as far as honour permitted, a certain peace of thought by asking\r\nwhether this indirect action of the personal Ruler over such vast\r\nprovinces did not enhance the idea of him instead of detracting from it.\r\n\r\nGoethe would have been prepared, on his principles, to recognise the\r\nstep taken in the direction of natural law as a victory for our\r\nincreasing knowledge of and reverence for the Deity. For him a natural\r\nlaw was the will of God; if natural selection created species, he would\r\nhave seen merely the will of God in selection. But Darwin had not yet\r\nadvanced so far, and still less could this be expected in his pious\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nHowever, we find a curious confession a few paragraphs before the\r\ntheistic conclusion of the book. It runs: “Light will be thrown on the\r\norigin and history of humanity.” Light, that is to say, from the theory\r\nof the transformation of species by natural selection. The words\r\ncontained the promise of a new twilight of the gods. In the innocent\r\ndays, when the Creator stood in person behind each species of animal and\r\nplant, Linné had seen no great innovation in his defining man as a\r\ndefinite species, the highest species of mammal. God had created the\r\npolar bear and the hippopotamus, _Genesis_ said, as well as man. That\r\nman had transgressed the command in Paradise, fallen into sin, needed\r\nsalvation, and so on, was another matter altogether. With Darwin the\r\ninnovation was incalculably important.\r\n\r\nOn his theory the various species of animals had been developed from\r\neach other, without a new creative act. If man was an animal species in\r\nthis sense, he also must have originated from other animals; and that\r\nwould be bitter. The phrase shows that Darwin already saw clearly, and\r\nhad abandoned his belief in a special creation of man. But this point\r\nwas bound to make more bad blood than all the rest put together. God,\r\nnow restricted to the direct production of the first living things, had\r\nlost man as well as the animals. Moreover, whatever interpretation was\r\nput upon the Mosaic narrative, the very source of theistic belief, the\r\nBible, was called into question. How had we come to know of this story\r\nof divine creations? By the Bible, the vehicle of revelation. But this\r\nBible was the work of man, and man was now well within the bounds of\r\nnature, from which God had been excluded. How could he learn anything\r\nfrom revelation? The biblical writers had clearly only made conjectures.\r\nSome of them—with regard to Adam, for instance—were certainly incorrect.\r\nThere was nothing in the Bible about evolution by means of selection.\r\nIndeed, was not the whole picture of a creating Deity an error? These\r\nthoughts were bound to press upon the religious mind with all their\r\nlogical force. When they did so, the very foundations of theology became\r\ninsecure, to a far more serious extent than Darwin’s moderate conclusion\r\nsuggested. When the book fell on this contentious ground, it was bound,\r\neven if it were only read in the last two pages, to provoke vast waves\r\nof hostility against its heretical zoology and botany, especially in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaeckel was in Italy when the work—the work of _his_ life, too, as the\r\nsequel shows—was published. We have seen where he was: in sight of the\r\nblue sea, penetrating for the first time into a special section of\r\nzoology, the radiolaria, and making it his own. He was far from\r\ntheorising, for the first years of reality were upon him. He returned to\r\nBerlin at the beginning of May, 1860, bringing his study of the\r\nradiolaria, and resolved to publish it in comprehensive form. Here he\r\nlearned for the first time that a “mad” work by Darwin had appeared,\r\nthat denied the venerable Linnean dogma of the immutability of species.\r\n\r\nGerman official science was now invaded from two sides at once. Haeckel\r\nhad returned like a new man from the freshness of Italy; and Darwin’s\r\nwork, translated by Bronn, was bringing some slight extract of the\r\nEnglish student’s thoughts, like a draught of old golden wine. They were\r\nbound to meet this time.\r\n\r\nThe aged Bronn, a German naturalist of distinction and merit, had found\r\nthe _Origin of Species_ interesting enough, at least, to deserve the\r\ntrouble of translation. But his interest in it was very restricted. He\r\nwas one of the thoughtful students of the days following Cuvier, and was\r\nnot of the kind to pin his faith to one man. The appearance of the plant\r\nand animal species in the various terrestrial periods, so sharply\r\nseparated by Cuvier himself, showed unmistakably an ascent from lower to\r\nhigher forms. The fish is placed lower in the system than the mammal. At\r\na certain period there were fishes living, but no mammals as yet. At\r\nanother period the only plants on the earth were of the decidedly lower\r\ngroup of the cryptogams (ferns, shore-grasses, club-mosses), and these\r\nwere succeeded by pines and palm-ferns, and finally by the true palms\r\nand foliage-trees. Cuvier’s theory of creation had to take account of\r\nthis. Agassiz, who held firmly to the fresh creation of species in each\r\nnew epoch, conceived the Creator as an artist who improved in his work\r\nin the course of time. Each new achievement was better than the\r\npreceding. It was rather a curious idea of the Creator!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PHOTOGRAPH OF MARBLE BUST BY G. HEROLD.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOthers, who did not venture to use the idea of Deity quite so naïvely as\r\nAgassiz in zoology and botany, conceived a “law of development” within\r\nlife itself. It was a time when belief in a “vital force” was universal.\r\nLiving things had their peculiar force, which was not found in lifeless\r\nthings. The life-principle might be at work in the law of development.\r\nIt would raise living things higher and higher in the succeeding\r\ngeological epochs. It was a vague theory, though it purported to cover\r\nnot only the fact but the machinery of development. In the course of\r\nages it brought about the appearance of new species. Those who held this\r\nidea of an immanent law of evolution rejected the older notion of a\r\npersonal Deity, putting in an appearance suddenly at the beginning of\r\nthe secondary period and creating the ichthyosauri “out of nothing.”\r\nThey looked upon Cuvier’s catastrophes, to which Agassiz still clung,\r\nwith a touch of Lyell’s scepticism. The “law of evolution” had been the\r\n_deus ex machina_ of the long procession of life-forms. One day a fish\r\nceased to give birth to little fishes in the manner of its parents. The\r\n“law of evolution” was at work in its ova, and suddenly little\r\nichthyosauri were developed from them. Thus, again, a lizard was\r\nbelieved to have engendered young mammals one day. One student would\r\nhold that the transition was quite abrupt in this sense. Another would\r\nthink it more gradual, and approach the idea of a slow transformation of\r\na fish into a lizard, and a lizard into a mammal, or a tree-fern into a\r\npalm-fern, and this into a true palm. At the bottom they were all agreed\r\nthat the whole inner law of evolution had nothing whatever in common\r\nwith the other laws of nature and was not subordinate to them. They did\r\nnot hold an evolution in harmony with the great mechanism of natural\r\nlaws. Their principle got astride of natural laws at certain points,\r\nlike a little man, and turned them in this or that direction.\r\n\r\nVery little philosophic reflection was needed to show that they had\r\nmerely replaced the Creator with a word. The older Dualism remained. On\r\none side was the raw material of the world with the ordinary natural\r\nlaws; on the other side a lord and master, the law of evolution, playing\r\nwith the laws as it pleased, and moulding the material into new\r\nlife-forms in an advancing series. It is true that they no longer\r\npictured to themselves a venerable being with a white beard creating the\r\nichthyosauri, but the finger of God remained in the law of evolution,\r\nattenuated into a special and spectral form. The God that acted from\r\nwithout was banished, but the “impulse from within,” reduced to a mere\r\nskeleton in substance, was put upon the throne.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the law of evolution had assuredly done much in\r\npreparing the way for Darwin, as they had insisted that certain advances\r\nin detail were undeniable and built up theories from the chaotic\r\nmaterial provided by special research—especially seeing that some of the\r\nablest naturalists of the time were amongst them, who determined to\r\nretain speculation in zoology and botany. But, on the other hand, it\r\ncannot be questioned that the confused nature of their fundamental idea,\r\nwhich, in fact, was not far removed from the theological notion of the\r\nvital force, gave the rigid and “exact” academic workers an apparent\r\nright to reject _all_ speculation on the possibility of an evolution of\r\nspecies as an unscientific dream. The aged Bronn was in 1860 one of the\r\nmost prudent and sober of the advocates of the inner principle of\r\nevolution. He candidly acknowledged that Darwin had struck a severe blow\r\nat the great idea of his life, on one side at least. Darwin’s work not\r\nmerely dismissed God to the wings as a personality, but even left no\r\nroom for the finger of God, for his spiritual writing on the walls of\r\nthe living world. It found evidence of natural laws alone. From them\r\ncame, if not life itself, at all events selection, adaptation, and\r\nevolution by virtue of this increasing adaptation—the higher advance\r\nthat converted the fish into a lizard and the lizard into a mammal. The\r\nfine old worker, with an age of indefatigable labour behind him, though\r\nhe had not got beyond the idea of a “law of evolution,” looked on Darwin\r\nwith a mixture of fear and admiration as he cut into the very heart of\r\nthese problems. He added amiable notes to the work to the effect that\r\none would like to go so far, but the distance was intimidating. In fact,\r\nhe omitted altogether from his translation the very important phrase\r\nthat “light would be thrown on the origin of man.” It would be a\r\nterrible affair, he thought, if the discussion were at once turned on\r\nthis. Man himself owing his origin neither to God nor the finger of God,\r\nbut to natural selection in the ordinary course of natural laws! It was\r\nnot to be thought of. Hence the phrase was struck out, as quite too\r\nextravagant, in his otherwise admirable work.\r\n\r\nBronn had himself become something of a revolutionary amongst his\r\ncolleagues by the translation. The rigidly “exact” workers crossed\r\nthemselves before the Germanised work. Most of the “evolutionists” in\r\nthe older sense had by no means the _bonhomie_ to speak even of a\r\n“possibility” like the patriarch Bronn. From the first Darwin\r\nwas—Haeckel was the first to experience it—branded with the anathemas of\r\nthe two opposite schools of science in Germany. On the one hand the\r\nrigorous and exact workers declared that his teaching was pure\r\nmetaphysics, because it sought to prove evolution and contemplated vast\r\nideal connections. On the other hand the Dualist metaphysicians\r\ndenounced him as an empiric of the worst character, who sought to\r\nreplace the great ideal elements in the world by a few miserable natural\r\nnecessities. It is significant to find that Schopenhauer, the brilliant\r\nthinker, regarded the _Origin of Species_ as one of the empirical\r\nsoapsud or barber books produced by exact investigation, which he\r\nthoroughly despised from his metaphysical point of view. And there were\r\nalready (there are more to-day) whole schools of zoology and botany that\r\nlooked upon Darwin’s theoretical explanations as unscientific\r\n“mysticism,” “metaphysics,” and “philosophy in the worst sense of the\r\nword.”\r\n\r\nHaeckel read the dangerous book at Berlin in May, 1860. “It profoundly\r\nmoved me,” he writes to me, “at the first reading. But as _all_ the\r\nBerlin magnates (with the single exception of Alexander Braun) were\r\nagainst it, I could make no headway in my defence of it. I did not\r\nbreathe freely until I visited Gegenbaur at Jena (June, 1860); my long\r\nconversations with him finally confirmed my conviction of the truth of\r\nDarwinism or transformism.”\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, in the critical days immediately before or during the\r\nnegotiations with Gegenbaur which led to his setting up as a private\r\nteacher at Jena. The names of Darwin and Jena unite chronologically in\r\nHaeckel’s life—two great names that were to bear him into the very\r\ndepths of his career, and that have their roots in the same hour.\r\n\r\nWe may ask what it was in the book that “profoundly moved” the young\r\nstudent of the radiolaria. The name of Braun only partly explains the\r\nmatter, as Braun was an evolutionist of the same type as Bronn. He was\r\namiably disposed to meet it, but did not openly enter on the new path.\r\nWe must go deeper. We then understand it clearly enough, if we recollect\r\nHaeckel’s bent in the last few years.\r\n\r\nHe had no longer any scruples with regard to religion. The God of\r\ntradition had been entirely replaced in him by Goethe’s God, who did not\r\nstand outside of, but was one with, nature. “There is nothing within,\r\nnothing without: for what is within is without.” There was not a kernel,\r\nGod, and a shell, Nature. “Nature has neither kernel nor shell: it is\r\nboth together.”\r\n\r\nThe years spent in southern Italy had certainly helped to bring out as\r\nstrongly as possible the contrast between Goethe’s conception and the\r\nconventional idea of God as an extramundane Creator. No surroundings are\r\nmore apt to do this than the Romance peoples of the Mediterranean. In\r\nthe northern, Protestant countries the ecclesiastical tradition of Deity\r\nhas always a spiritual element, a kind of vague resolution into moral\r\nlaws, that in some measure approach natural law, though one made by man.\r\nThere is no trace of this in Naples and Sicily. The supernatural there\r\nis the saint, the madonna; they penetrate unceasingly into the natural\r\nreality, in every little detail of life and conduct. The antithesis of\r\nthe poor cosmic machinery and the ever-present heavenly help and\r\nsupersession of it is raised to a supreme height in the popular belief.\r\nMiracles are not relegated to earlier days and ancient books. They are\r\nexpected, affirmed, and believed every day. The saint fills the net of\r\nthe fisherman as he chases the edible cuttle-fishes by torchlight. The\r\nsaint makes the storm that threatens the boat—makes it suddenly out of\r\nnothing. The madonna can arrest in a second the glowing stream of lava\r\nthat rolls towards the village from Vesuvius, and if hundreds of them\r\nunite in ardent prayer and the making of vows, she will be appeased and\r\ndo it. Every hair on a man’s head is twofold; there is the natural hair\r\nand a hair that can at any moment be changed, transformed, annihilated,\r\nor created afresh from nothing, by divine power. The man who has lived\r\nin this atmosphere of practical Dualism for years must be saturated to\r\nhis innermost being with a feeling of the absolute contradiction between\r\nthis conception of God and nature and Goethe’s philosophy. If he is to\r\nfollow Goethe, this ancient extramundane, ever-interfering Deity must be\r\ngiven up without the least attempt at compromise.\r\n\r\nThus Haeckel’s position was incomparably more radical than Darwin’s from\r\nthe very first. He no longer believed in a Creator, either in whole or\r\npart.\r\n\r\nHe asked himself, therefore, how he could now explain certain things in\r\nnature. He had learned from the great Johannes Müller that species were\r\nunchangeable, and it was impossible to conceive the spontaneous\r\ngeneration of the living from the dead. The essence, the predominant\r\nelement of the living thing was the mysterious, purposive “vital force.”\r\nThe first of these three ideas of the master’s to be surrendered\r\nentirely by him was the vital force. Even in Müller’s lifetime, and in\r\nhis own laboratory, so to say, his pupil, Du Bois-Reymond, made the\r\nfirst great breach in the doctrine with his famous study of animal\r\nelectricity, a really pioneer piece of work, especially as regards\r\nmethod, at that time. It was now more than ever probable that there was\r\nno more a special vital force besides the simple natural forces than\r\nthere was a God distinct from nature. The animal or the plant was a\r\nwonderful outcome of the same laws that had built the crystal or the\r\nglobe. The sharp distinction between living and dead matter fell into\r\nthe waste-basket, where so many other Dualistic tags lay, cut off by the\r\nshears of science.\r\n\r\nBut if one of Müller’s theses was abandoned, another was retained as a\r\nreal blessing with all the more tenacity by his pupils—the thesis that\r\neven the scientific investigator shall always “think”—nay, even\r\n“philosophise.” Müller called it “using one’s imagination,” in his\r\ndesire to emphasise it. Now it was certainly a fair philosophic\r\ndeduction from Du Bois-Reymond’s discoveries that one ought no longer to\r\nbe so rigid as regards the possibility of spontaneous generation. If the\r\nsame natural forces are at work in the organic and the inorganic, the\r\nliving and the dead, it is no longer inconceivable theoretically that\r\nlife and inorganic matter only differ in degree, not in kind. The\r\ndistinction might become so slender—either now, or at least in past\r\ntimes—that an apparent “spontaneous generation” might really take place.\r\n\r\nHere again, it is plain, Haeckel had a greater freedom than Darwin.\r\nWorking gradually from above, Darwin desisted when he came to\r\nspontaneous generation, and left room for God. Haeckel came into an open\r\nfield, believing that there was no eternal Deity and that spontaneous\r\ngeneration itself was by no means a forbidding conception. The problem\r\nfor him was merely, how he could work upward through the plants and\r\nanimals of all geological periods until he reached man. He was bound to\r\nseek to dispense even here with the historical vital force, and explain\r\neverything by the great natural laws of the cosmos.\r\n\r\nIt was in this frame of mind that he received Darwin’s book. Can it be\r\nin the least surprising that it “profoundly moved” him. It opened out to\r\nhim the whole way, just as he desired it. Müller’s third thesis, the\r\nimmutability of species, broke down. But what did it matter? It was now\r\npossible for the first time to construct a philosophical zoology and\r\nbotany in Müller’s sense, without any vital force and without God.\r\n\r\nAt the same time this rapid and impulsive acceptance of Darwin’s theory\r\nwas not merely a decisive moment in Haeckel’s intellectual development;\r\nit was bound to be, even externally, a most important step in his\r\ncareer. The theistic controversy was forced on his attention. It passed\r\nout of the province of his inmost life, that had hitherto only been\r\ndiscussed in conversation with intimate friends, into the professional\r\nwork of his most serious and public occupation—into zoology, into the\r\nradiolaria at which he had been working for years.\r\n\r\nWe must realise clearly what it must have meant at that time for a young\r\nzoologist, who wanted to do rigorous professional work and had quickly\r\ndecided to settle at Jena in order to begin his career as an official\r\nteacher, to become “a Darwinian” in conviction and open confession. It\r\nmight cost him both his official position and his scientific future; and\r\nthis at the very moment when he had just secured them, or was in a\r\nbetter position to secure them. We have here for the first time the open\r\nmanifestation of a principle in Haeckel’s life that he had hitherto only\r\nused inwardly, in application to himself. The truth must be told,\r\nwhatever it cost. Shoot me dead, morally, materially, or bodily, as you\r\nwill: but you will have to shoot the law first.\r\n\r\nDarwin’s ominous book had been available in Bronn’s translation for two\r\nyears. The German professional zoologists, botanists, and geologists\r\nalmost all regarded it as absolute nonsense. Agassiz, Giebel,\r\nKeferstein, and so many others, laughed until they were red in the face,\r\nlike a riotous first-night public that has made up its mind as to the\r\nabsurdity of the play from the first act, and torment the author as the\r\ncat torments a mouse. Then Haeckel gave to the world his long-prepared\r\n_Monograph on the Radiolaria_ (1862), the work with which he endeavours\r\nto establish—in fact, must establish—his position as an exact\r\ninvestigator, even amongst the academic scholars of the opposite camp.\r\nAll goes very smoothly for many pages of the work. A few traces of\r\nheresy may be detected about page 100. The passage deals with the\r\nrelation of organ to individual, in connection with the social species\r\nof radiolaria that live in communities. It is a subject that Haeckel\r\ntook up with great vigour later on, as we shall see. Here it affords him\r\nan opportunity to say a word about the general fusion of things in the\r\nworld of life, in opposition to our rigid divisions in classification.\r\nOrgan and individual pass into each other without any fixed limit. That,\r\nhe says, is only a repetition of the relation of the plant to the\r\nanimal. We cannot establish any fixed limitations between them. What we\r\nset up as such are only man’s abstractions. In nature itself we never\r\nfind these subjective abstract ideas of limitation “incorporated purely,\r\nbut always fading away in gradual transitions; here, again, the scale of\r\norganisation rises gradually from the simplest to the most complex, in a\r\ncontinuous development.” However, these are words that might have been\r\nwritten by Schleiden or Unger or Bronn before Darwin’s time.\r\n\r\nYet there is something in the work that would have been a jet of\r\nice-cold water to the Agassizs and Giebels. This brilliant new\r\n“Extraordinary Professor of Zoology and Director of the Zoological\r\nMuseum at Jena University,” as it says on the title-page, accepts Darwin\r\nin a certain unambiguous passage late in the text.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to bring to light once more this passage, buried in a\r\nwork that is not easily accessible, an expensive technical work\r\nseparated from us by four decades now. It is worth doing so, not only on\r\naccount of the courage it displayed at the time, but also as a document\r\nrelating to the great controversy of the nineteenth century. It is found\r\non pages 231 and 232, partly in the text, but for the most part in a\r\nnote. Immediately after giving the table of classification Haeckel goes\r\non to say: “I cannot leave this general account of the relationship of\r\nthe various families of the radiolaria without drawing special attention\r\nto the numerous transitional forms that most intimately connect the\r\ndifferent groups and make it difficult to separate them in\r\nclassification, to some extent.” It is interesting to note that in spite\r\nof our very defective knowledge of the radiolaria it is nevertheless\r\npossible to arrange “a fairly continuous chain of related forms.” He\r\nwould like to draw particular attention to this, because “the great\r\ntheories that Charles Darwin has lately put forward, in his _Origin of\r\nSpecies in the Plant and Animal World by Natural Selection, or The\r\nPreservation of the Improved Races in the Struggle for Life_, and which\r\nhave opened out a new epoch for systematic biology, have given such\r\nimportance to the question of the affinities of organisms and to proofs\r\nof continuous concatenation that even the smallest contribution towards\r\nthe further solution of these problems must be welcome.” He then\r\nendeavours in the text, without any more theoretical observations,\r\npractically to construct a “genealogical tree of the radiolaria,” the\r\nfirst of a large number of such trees in the future. He takes as the\r\nprimitive radiolarian a simple trellis-worked globule with centrifugal\r\nradiating needles, embodied in the _Heliosphæra_. “At the same time,” he\r\nsays, characteristically, “this does not imply in the least that all the\r\nradiolaria must have descended from this primitive form; I merely show\r\nthat, as a matter of fact, all these very varied forms may be derived\r\nfrom such a common fundamental type.” In other words, once more, it is\r\n_conceivable_—a golden word even long afterwards. The first\r\n“genealogical tree,” a “table of the related families, sub-families, and\r\ngenera of the radiolaria,” arranged in order from the higher forms down,\r\nand connected with lines and brackets, comes next. The text deals\r\nthoroughly with the possibility of descent. This closes the first and\r\ngeneral part of the monograph. But there is a long note at this point in\r\nthe text, where Darwin’s title is cited, that gives us his first\r\nappreciation of Darwin in detail. It begins: “I cannot refrain from\r\nexpressing here the great admiration with which Darwin’s able theory of\r\nthe origin of species has inspired me. Especially as this epoch-making\r\nwork has for the most part been unfavourably received by our German\r\nprofessors of science, and seems in some cases to have been entirely\r\nmisunderstood. Darwin himself desires his theory to be submitted to\r\nevery possible test, and ‘looks confidently to the young workers who\r\nwill be prepared to examine both sides of the question impartially.\r\nWhoever leans to the view that species are changeable will do a service\r\nto science by a conscientious statement of his conviction; only in that\r\nway can we get rid of the mountain of prejudice that at present covers\r\nthe subject.’ I share this view entirely,” Haeckel continues, “and on\r\nthat account feel that I must express here my belief in the mutability\r\nof species and the real genealogical relation of all organisms. Although\r\nI hesitate to accept Darwin’s views and hypotheses to the full and to\r\nendorse the whole of his argument, I cannot but admire the earnest,\r\nscientific attempt made in his work to explain all the phenomena of\r\norganic nature on broad and consistent principles and to substitute an\r\nintelligible natural law for unintelligible miracles. There may be more\r\nerror than truth in Darwin’s theory in its present form, as the first\r\nattempt to deal with the subject. Undeniably important as are the\r\nprinciples of natural selection, the struggle for life, the relation of\r\norganisms to each other, the divergence of characters, and all the other\r\nprinciples employed by Darwin in support of his theory, it is,\r\nnevertheless, quite possible that there are just as many and important\r\nprinciples still quite unknown to us that have an equal or even greater\r\ninfluence on the phenomena of organic nature. This is the first great\r\nattempt to construct a scientific, physiological theory of the\r\ndevelopment of organic life and to prove that the physiological laws and\r\nthe chemical and physical forces that rule in nature to-day must also\r\nhave been at work in the world of yesterday.” Haeckel then refers to\r\nBronn, the translator of the book. With Bronn he calls Darwin’s theory\r\nthe fertilised egg from which the truth will gradually develop; the pupa\r\nfrom which the long-sought natural law will emerge. And he concludes:\r\n“The chief defect of the Darwinian theory is that it throws no light on\r\nthe origin of the primitive organism—probably a simple cell—from which\r\nall the others have descended. When Darwin assumes a special creative\r\nact for this first species, he is not consistent and, I think, not quite\r\nsincere. However, apart from these and other defects, Darwin’s theory\r\nhas the undying merit of bringing sense and reason into the whole\r\nsubject of the relations of living things. When we remember how every\r\ngreat reform, every important advance, meets with a resistance in\r\nproportion to the depth of the prejudices and dogmas it assails, we\r\nshall not be surprised that Darwin’s able theory has as yet met with\r\nlittle but hostility instead of its well-merited appreciation and test.”\r\nThere is yet no question of man and his origin. But what he says is very\r\nbold for the time; and before a year is out we shall find him drawing\r\nthe most dangerous conclusion of all. And it is found, not in a late\r\npage and note in a stout technical volume, but in the pitiless glare of\r\nthe sunlight, in the most prominent position that could then be given to\r\nit in German scientific culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                    THE SCIENTIFIC CONGRESS OF 1863\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second decade of the nineteenth century, Oken had inspired the\r\nformation of large public gatherings of German naturalists and\r\nphysicians. Oken was one of the advanced thinkers who felt that all\r\ntechnical science was in the end only preparatory to the great work of\r\neducating the people. In his opinion the naturalist, even if he spent\r\nhis whole life in investigating the filaments of plants or the limbs of\r\ninsects, was a pioneer of culture. In any case these gatherings were a\r\nvery good practical move at the time. In a time of terrible reaction on\r\nall sides a feeling came at last even to the recluse of science that,\r\nbesides the technical value of his work, it ought to do something\r\ntowards lifting his fellows out of the rut they were falling into. They\r\nfelt that if all ideals were going to be lost, the ultimate aim of\r\nspecial research would perish with them. Oken took up a position of\r\ndemocratic opposition. He was soon joined by Alexander von Humboldt,\r\nwho, with the same feeling at heart, gave the work a certain polish of\r\nscientific and impartial dignity. There are features of his work that\r\namuse us to-day, but those were evil days, and every particle of\r\ngoodwill had to be appreciated. However, there was a serious difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe bolder elements met in congresses, and encouraged each other in the\r\npursuit of their ideal. But it at once became clear in their public\r\ndiscussions that some of their purely scientific discoveries were\r\ndangerous and heretical in such a period of reaction. This or that had\r\nhitherto been buried innocently in scientific monographs, quite unknown\r\nto the crowd, and the author might be a royal councillor, receive\r\ndecorations, and almost be an elder of the Church. Suddenly, by means of\r\nthese assemblies, the sinfulness of all this lore about snails or\r\ninsects or vertebrates was brought to light and put before the profane\r\npublic, and there was much anger. The whole of scientific research was\r\nfull of secret plots, heresies, and bombs—against God.\r\n\r\nThere was a most appalling illustration of this in the Scientific\r\nCongress, held in September, 1863. Nothing is more amusing to-day than\r\nto run through the yellow and almost unknown papers of the Congress.\r\nThey are illuminating to some extent. An idea that belongs to humanity\r\nis openly brought into the debate for the first time. Ages lie behind\r\nthis hour. We must grant all that savours of human comedy, of triviality\r\neven, in such an assembly, but after all we must see in it the swell and\r\nclash of great waves. Haeckel spoke for the first time on Darwin’s\r\ntheory, at a spot from which the waves were bound to spread through the\r\nwhole scientific culture of the land. Virchow, afterwards his bitter\r\nopponent, supported him. All the deepest questions and consequences of\r\nDarwinism were mooted with the first vibrant accents. It was a great and\r\nunforgettable hour.\r\n\r\nThe first speaker at the Congress on the Sunday evening, September 19,\r\n1863, was Haeckel. We must remember the charm that attached to his\r\nperson even outwardly, the direct charm that did not need any allusion\r\nto his growing repute in zoology. It was the charm that had been felt by\r\nthe simple folk of uncultured Italy, who had never heard even the name\r\nof the science. Darwin was never a handsome man from the æsthetic point\r\nof view. When he wanted to sail with FitzRoy, it was a very near\r\nquestion whether the splenetic captain would not reject him because he\r\ndid not like his nose. His forehead had so striking a curve that\r\nLombroso, the expert, could put him down as having “the\r\nidiot-physiognomy” in his _Genius and Insanity_. At the time when he\r\nwrote the _Origin of Species_ he had not the patriarchal beard that is\r\ninseparable from his image in our minds; he was bald, and his chin clean\r\nshaved. The prematurely bent form of the invalid could never have had\r\nmuch effect in such a place, no matter what respect was felt for him.\r\nHaeckel, young and handsome, was an embodiment of the _mens sana in\r\ncorpore sano_. He rose above the grey heads of science, as the type of\r\nthe young, fresh, brilliant generation. It was an opponent at this\r\nCongress, who sharply attacked the new ideas, that spoke of the\r\n“colleague in the freshness of youth” who had brought forward the\r\nsubject. He brought with him the highest thing that a new idea can\r\nassociate with: the breath of a new generation, of a youth that greets\r\nall new ideas with a smiling courage. Behind this was the thought of\r\nDarwin himself, a wave that swept away all dams.\r\n\r\nThe speech was as clear as crystal, and is still useful as an\r\nintroduction to the Darwinian question. He at once strikes the greatest\r\nand the dominant note. Darwin means a new philosophy. All organisms\r\ndescend from a few primitive forms, possibly from one; and man is one of\r\nthese organisms. What Darwin had merely hinted in his concluding\r\npassage, what the aged Bronn had excluded altogether from his\r\ntranslation as too dangerous, was now set forth emphatically in the very\r\nbeginning of his speech. “As regards man himself, if we are consistent\r\nwe must recognise his immediate ancestors in ape-like mammals; earlier\r\nstill in kangaroo-like marsupials; beyond these, in the secondary\r\nperiod, in lizard-like reptiles; and finally, at a yet earlier stage,\r\nthe primary period, in lowly organised fishes.”\r\n\r\nThere is something monumental in this passage, as in the previous\r\nconfession of Darwinism in the _Monograph on the Radiolaria_. Others may\r\nhave come to similar conclusions at the time on reading Darwin’s work.\r\nHere we have the profession made at the psychological moment, a\r\ntrumpet-blast that sent its thrilling alarm from the threshold of a new\r\nage, for friend or foe to hear. The speech gives a slightly exaggerated\r\naccount of the struggle that already existed. All was in confusion.\r\nScience was breaking up into two camps. On the one side evolution and\r\nprogress, on the other the creation and immutability of species. Already\r\nthere are distinguished leaders of science in favour of evolution. It is\r\ntime to discuss the matter in full publicity—and the thing is done.\r\n\r\nThere was, let me say parenthetically, on the Continent at least no\r\nquestion at that time of this clear division, or even of a serious\r\nagitation. It was partly this speech, together with Haeckel’s next work,\r\nthat was to bring it about. To the highest authorities the subject\r\nseemed to be below the level of discussion. We must recall a passage\r\nthat the Professor of Zoology at Göttingen, Keferstein, had written a\r\nyear before in the _Göttinger Gelehrte Anzeiger_. “It gives great\r\nsatisfaction to the earnest scientific worker,” we read, “to see a man\r\nlike Agassiz, with an authority based on the finest zoological works,\r\nreject unreservedly a theory [Darwin’s] that would discredit the whole\r\nwork of classifiers for a century, and to see that the views built up by\r\nseveral generations and the general consent of humanity hold a stronger\r\nposition than the views of a single individual, however eloquently they\r\nmay be stated.” There is no idea in this of two regular camps of\r\nscientists. Humanity is adduced as the one party; against it stands the\r\nanarchist, trying to blow up the work of centuries, Darwin. But that\r\ngave no concern to the young orator; he saw a whole decade of success in\r\nthe first attack.\r\n\r\nHe rolled off geology. Cuvier’s theory of catastrophes, Linné’s belief\r\nin the immutability of species—all a purely theological cosmogony. The\r\n“philosophical theory of evolution” rises behind it like a Mene Tekel\r\nPharshim.\r\n\r\nAll living things, including those of past geological epochs, form one\r\ngreat _genealogical tree_. The word, the new leading word for zoology\r\nand botany, comes out with a flash. What is the system that has been\r\nawaited so long? It is the genealogical tree of life on our planet. Its\r\nroots lie deep in the remote past. “The thousands of green leaves on the\r\ntree that clothe the younger and fresher twigs, and differ in their\r\nheight and breadth from the trunk, correspond to the living species of\r\nanimals and plants; these are the more advanced, the further they are\r\nremoved from the primeval stem. The withered and faded leaves, that we\r\nsee on the older and dead twigs, represent the many extinct species that\r\ndwelt on the earth in earlier geological ages, and come closer to the\r\nprimeval simple stem-form, the more remote they are from us.”\r\n\r\nThis was the great new idea for science to work upon. Paleontology, the\r\nscience of past life, found at last a common task with botany and\r\nzoology. Haeckel’s own programme for decades was unfolded. This phrase,\r\ntoo, was a birth-hour. In all the struggle that has followed as to the\r\n“how” of evolution this figure of the tree with the verdant branches as\r\nthe new field of zoological and botanical work, and the withered\r\nbranches for the paleontologist, has never been abandoned. A symbol from\r\nthe living world itself, the branching tree, had at last taken a\r\ndecisive place in the science and the classification of living things.\r\nWith splendid clearness the speech then enumerates the Darwinian\r\nprinciples: variation, heredity, the struggle for life, selection, and\r\nadaptation. A vast duration is claimed for the geological epochs in the\r\nsense of Lyell; and it is pointed out that there is a progressive\r\nadvance of forms throughout these periods. Special stress is laid on the\r\never-advancing, ever-uplifting element in evolution. Man is again\r\nintroduced into the subject. He has “evolved” from the brutality of the\r\nanimal. Language itself has been naturally “developed.” (What a shrewd\r\nperspective in such a brief phrase! How the philologists would stare!)\r\nSo the “law of advance” traverses the whole field of culture. A fiery\r\npassage follows: “Reaction in political, social, moral, and scientific\r\nlife, such as the selfish efforts of priests and despots have brought\r\nabout at every period of history,” cannot permanently hinder this\r\nadvance. The “advance” is “a law of nature,” and “neither the weapons of\r\nthe tyrant nor the anathemas of the priest can ever suppress it.” We\r\nhear again the older Sethe thundering his intrepid reply: “You will have\r\nto shoot the law first.”\r\n\r\nAt the close he glances briefly at the difficulties the theory presents.\r\nWe must regard even the first beginnings of life as the outcome of\r\n“evolution.” Naturally. Darwin’s God has no use for this prophet. But\r\nhow shall we conceive it? Was the thing that first developed from the\r\ninorganic “a simple cell, such a being as those that now exist in such\r\nnumbers as independent beings on the ambiguous frontier of the animal\r\nand vegetal worlds?” Or was it a particle of plasm merely, “like certain\r\namœboid organisms that do not seem to have attained yet the organisation\r\nof a cell”? Again the simple question contained a whole programme.\r\n\r\nSchleiden had first shown in 1838 that the body of any plant can be\r\ndissolved into tiny living corpuscles, which he called “cells,” because\r\nthey often had the appearance of a filled honeycomb. A year later\r\nSchwann proved, in Johannes Müller’s laboratory, that the higher animal\r\nalso is a product of these cells. The cell was recognised as the living\r\nunit that composed the oak and the rose, the elephant and the worm. Man\r\nhimself, in fine, was but a pyramid of these cells—or, to speak more\r\naccurately (as each cell has its own life), an immense community of\r\ncells, a cell-state.\r\n\r\nVirchow had, as we saw, laid the greatest stress on this last and most\r\nimportant deduction from the cell-theory a short time before. He looked\r\nupon every individual man as a mysterious plurality—a plurality of\r\ncells. Pathology, the science of disease, must take account of this.\r\nHealth was the harmonious co-operation of the cell-state; disease was\r\nthe falling-away of some of the cells to special work that injured or\r\ndestroyed the whole community. This conception had inaugurated a new\r\nepoch in medicine, making it a consciously ministering art in the\r\nservice of the living human natural organism. The Darwinian had now the\r\ntask of showing the validity of this conception in his own province. The\r\ngenealogical tree of the animals and plants must at once be drawn up in\r\nthe form of a genealogical tree of the cell. The cells had combined to\r\nform higher and higher communities, and each higher species of animal or\r\nplant was in reality one of these social constructions. But this\r\ncomplexity was only found in the upper branches. The lower we descend,\r\nthe simpler we find organisms. The lowest forms of life represent\r\ncruder, simpler, and more primitive cell-structures. And the final\r\nconclusion was that all the cell-communities or states must have been\r\nevolved from unattached individuals whose whole body consisted of a\r\nsingle cell. We cannot strictly call these lowest forms of life either\r\nanimals or plants; they can only be likened to the single cell. Though\r\nHaeckel himself did not know it at the time, all his pretty radiolaria\r\nat Messina belonged to this category. The whole swarm of bacilli and\r\nbacteria fell into this world of the “unicellulars.” Haeckel’s words\r\nthrew a brilliant light on the question. Not only the simplest forms of\r\nlife are unicellulars; the primitive forms also were. With them began\r\nthe colossal genealogical tree that branches out through the millions of\r\nyears of the earth’s history. If anything on the earth has arisen by\r\nspontaneous generation out of dead matter, at the commencement of all\r\nlife, it must have been a cell, or a still simpler particle of living\r\nplasm more or less resembling one. It is true that the point is put in\r\nthe form of a question; but the veil has been torn away. Given _one_\r\ncell, the whole genealogical tree grows on, in virtue of Darwin’s laws,\r\nuntil it reaches its highest point in man.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the speech greets Darwin as the Newton of the organic\r\nworld, a phrase that has often been repeated since.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us turn over a few pages more in the faded record of the sitting.\r\nFourteen years later he would speak again at a scientific congress, and\r\nspeak on Darwinism. He would then put it forward no longer as a hope but\r\na fulfilment, of which he showed one glittering facet. And no other than\r\nRudolf Virchow, his former teacher, would oppose him and deliver his\r\nfamous speech on the freedom of science in the modern State and its\r\nabuse by Darwin’s followers. This was at Munich in 1877. The least of\r\nhis hearers would remember that Virchow had spoken, like Haeckel, at\r\nStettin fourteen years previously. But we must understand the\r\nthirty-sixth speech if we are to understand the thirty-seventh.\r\n\r\nIt was the second sitting, on September 22nd. Virchow spoke on “the\r\nalleged materialism of modern science.” The subject was not provoked by\r\nHaeckel, but by Schleiden, the botanist, the parent of the cell-theory.\r\nThe controversy over materialism had raged furiously for many years. We\r\nneed only mention Büchner (whose _Force and Matter_ appeared in 1855)\r\nand Carl Vogt. There was an element of necessity, but a good deal of\r\nsuperficiality in the controversy, as it was then conducted. Friedrich\r\nAlbert Lange has given us a masterly history of it. At this moment it\r\nwas particularly instructive to point out the difference between general\r\nphilosophical skirmishing with words and a really able piece of work\r\nthat, though it had a technical look, suddenly added a new province to\r\nphilosophy on which every doubting Thomas could lay his hands. However,\r\nSchleiden had not advanced. Curiously enough, he, the first discoverer\r\nof the cell, attacked Virchow’s theory of man as a cell-state as a\r\ntypical materialist extravagance.\r\n\r\nHe had published a heated essay, and Virchow defended himself. He gave\r\nsuch a remarkable and characteristic expression of his inmost feelings\r\nthat it is worth while disinterring it. It is a very rare thing for a\r\nthoughtful man to give a natural-philosophical speech that begins with\r\ncrystalline clearness of logic and then makes a most curious _salto\r\nmortale_ at the critical point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ERNST HAECKEL, 1880.\r\n  _Reproduced from the Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte._\r\n]\r\n\r\nHe opens with a vigorous protest that there can be no quarrel about\r\nthe materialism of science with the “spiritual” and the\r\n“privately-orthodox.” Such people must regard all investigation of\r\n“this world” as aimless. The only thing of value for them is “the next\r\nworld”; the best attitude towards _this_ life is as crass an ignorance\r\nas possible, and so all science is worthless. The words are so sharp\r\nthat he was interrupted and had to explain that he was not attacking\r\nanybody personally. He was only speaking “with the candour of a\r\nscientific worker, who is in the habit of calling things by their\r\nproper names.” (At this point there was some applause.) Hence he is\r\nnot speaking of materialism, he says, on that account, but because of\r\ncertain objections from men of science, who said that philosophic\r\nspeculation led us out of our way. Schleiden had branded the theory of\r\nman as a cell-state, the conception of man as, not an absolute, but a\r\nfederal unity, as materialism. But this conception is not a\r\nphilosophical theory at all; it is a fact. It is a piece of scientific\r\ntruth, like the law of gravitation. He recurred to the old and\r\noften-quoted definition: the kind of research that brings such facts\r\nto light has nothing whatever to do with philosophy. On the other\r\nhand, “materialism,” in so far as it expresses a general theory of the\r\nworld, is a philosophy. Hence the simple investigation of facts as\r\nsuch can neither be dubbed materialistic nor said to have a\r\nphilosophic tinge.\r\n\r\nThere are many objections to this strict delimitation of the provinces\r\nof the human mind, as Virchow lays it down in the old style. It is true\r\nthat materialism is a real philosophy, especially in the form current at\r\nthe time and given to it by Vogt and Büchner. But it is a question\r\nwhether we see, observe, or investigate at all, if we completely exclude\r\nphilosophy; whether the philosophic thought can be really pumped out of\r\neven the most rigorous and exact “observation of facts,” like air in the\r\nair-pump; whether there are any such things as purely objective “facts”\r\nin this sense in any human brain. And it is also a question whether the\r\nfacts, however objectively we regard them, do not arrange themselves,\r\nwhen they are numerous, in logical series, which force us to draw\r\nconclusions as to the unknown by the very laws of probability; in other\r\nwords, whether they do not always produce a “philosophy” in the long\r\nrun. However, these questions are all well within the pure atmosphere of\r\nscience. It is Virchow’s practical conclusions that are interesting; and\r\nhe goes on to draw them freely.\r\n\r\nThe man of science gives us no dogmatic philosophy of any kind, but\r\nfacts. But for these facts and for the research that leads to them he\r\nmust have an _absolutely free_ path. No power can legitimately stand in\r\nhis way that does not offer him more of what he regards as his\r\npalladium—facts. And, curiously enough, when we think of later events,\r\nthe illustration that Virchow takes in 1863 to enforce this is—the\r\nDarwinism that Haeckel had just put before them.\r\n\r\nHaeckel and Virchow were friendly colleagues at the time. We have\r\nalready said that Haeckel was Virchow’s assistant at Würtzburg. Not only\r\nas a man, but especially as a scientist, Virchow was then (and long\r\nafterwards) greatly admired by him. The idea of the cell-state got into\r\nhis blood; it was one of the bases on which he built up the Darwinian\r\ntheory. Though he had never recognised this distinction between the mere\r\ninvestigation of facts and philosophic reflection on them, he respected\r\nVirchow as a master of methodological education. What was “method” at\r\nthe bottom but philosophy! Was not the method that expressly excluded\r\n“miracles,” that sought always the natural law and the causal connection\r\nand the continuous series, a “philosophy”? This was the only method\r\ntaught under Virchow as long as Haeckel worked with him. At the time the\r\ndivergence of their ideas was not shown more openly. The one called\r\n“philosophy” what the other said was “the purely objective method of\r\ninvestigating the truth.” The figure of Pilate rises up behind the\r\ndilemma with his question: “What is truth?”\r\n\r\nHowever, Virchow takes Darwinism by way of an example of which he\r\napproves, a point that seems to be established in the province of pure\r\nfacts. In the Munich speech of 1877 there are polite references to “Herr\r\nHaeckel.” “As Herr Haeckel says.” “As Herr Haeckel supposes.” At Stettin\r\nwe find Herr Haeckel described as “my friend Haeckel,” with whom “I\r\nquite agree,” &c. Haeckel himself, by the way, was still convinced—in\r\nhis essay _On the Generation of Waves in Living Particles_—two years\r\nbefore the schismatic Council of 1877 that Virchow had had a decisive\r\ninfluence on his own Darwinian career. “If I have contributed anything\r\nmyself in an elementary way to the building-up of the idea of evolution,\r\nI owe it for the most part to the cellular-biological views with which\r\nVirchow’s teaching penetrated me twenty years ago.” “As Herr Haeckel\r\nsupposes,” was the cool repayment of this sincere expression of\r\ngratitude. However, that is another matter. Let us return to Stettin. We\r\nread, where “my friend Haeckel” comes in, that he has shown how\r\nscientific research (the pure investigation of facts without the least\r\ntincture of philosophy) has gone on to deal with “the great question of\r\nthe creation of man.” It is merely conceded that there are still certain\r\nsmall outstanding difficulties, as, for instance, at the root of the\r\ngenealogical tree. According to Darwin it is conceivable that there were\r\nfour or five primitive forms of life. Haeckel is inclined to restrict\r\nthem to a single stem-cell. It seems to him (Virchow) that there may\r\nhave been a number of different beginnings of life. We have here the\r\nopening of the controversy as to the monophyletic (from one root only)\r\nor polyphyletic (from several roots) development of life, which is still\r\nunsettled as far as the commencement of life is concerned, but a very\r\nsecondary question. It would be well if there had never been any more\r\nserious difference between Haeckel and Virchow. The speaker himself\r\nthinks it an unimportant matter beside the great question of freedom for\r\nscientific inquiry. One thing is as clear to him as it is to Haeckel.\r\nThe biblical dogma of creation has broken down. It is impossible to take\r\nseriously any longer the breathing of the breath of life into a lump of\r\nclay, if these Darwinian ideas are sound. Once it is fully proved that\r\nman descends from the ape, “no tradition in the world will ever suppress\r\nthe fact.” Scientific inquiry alone can correct itself. And what it\r\nholds to be established must be respected beyond its frontiers as well.\r\nWhat does he mean by “beyond its frontiers”? He means, as he makes it\r\nclear here, the same as Haeckel himself. “Church and State,” he says,\r\nmust “reconcile themselves to the fact that with the advance of science\r\ncertain changes are bound to take place in the general ideas and beliefs\r\nfrom which we build up our highest conceptions, and that no impediment\r\nmust be put in the way of these changes; in fact, the far-seeing\r\nGovernment and the open-minded Church will always assimilate these\r\nadvancing and developing ideas and make them fruitful.” What more do we\r\nwant?\r\n\r\nIf this were the conclusion of Virchow’s speech, it would be merely a\r\nconfirmation of Haeckel’s—the kind of support that the older worker can\r\ngive to ardent youth, though on different grounds. But the cloven foot\r\nhas still to peep out. I believe that, in the pure struggle of ideas, we\r\ncan determine here, in 1863, precisely the point where Virchow\r\nfalls—falls into a line that has nothing in common with the ideal\r\nstruggle of the really free and liberating thought of humanity. We come\r\nto the great _salto mortale_, which one must see from 1863 onward in\r\norder to understand the Virchow of 1877.\r\n\r\nThe passage is the more interesting as it refers to one of the chief\r\nstages in the development of Haeckel’s mind. The conception of man as a\r\ncell-state, established by Virchow in so masterly a fashion, involved a\r\nvery curious conclusion. This conclusion, however we take it, came so\r\nclose to the roots of every philosophy that it justified Schleiden to\r\nsome extent when he protested that the whole cell-state theory was a\r\nphilosophical element.\r\n\r\nIf the human body is composed of millions of cells; if all the processes\r\nand functions, the whole life of the body in Virchow’s sense, are merely\r\nthe sum of the vital processes and functions of these millions of\r\nindividual cells; is not what we call “the soul” really the product of\r\nthe millions upon millions of separate souls of these cells? Is not\r\nman’s soul merely the state-soul, the general spirit of this gigantic\r\ncomplex of tiny cell-souls? The lowest living things we spoke of, which\r\nconsist of a single cell, showed unmistakable signs of having a psychic\r\nlife. There was nothing to prevent us from thinking that in the\r\ncombination of these various cells into communities each of them brought\r\nwith it its little psychic individuality. And just as the individual\r\nbodies of the cells combined externally to form the new individual of\r\nthe human body, so the cell-souls would enter into a spiritual\r\ncombination to form the new psychic individuality of the human mind. I\r\nsay there was nothing to prevent us from thinking this, in the line of\r\ndeductions from the plain principles of the cell-state theory which\r\nVirchow claimed to be a naked “fact.” Philosophically, however, an\r\nimmense number of questions, problems, doubts, and hopes lurked behind\r\nit. The whole conception of individuality took on a new aspect. First,\r\nin the material sense; the individual human being seemed to be, bodily,\r\nonly the connecting bracket, as it were, of countless deeper\r\nindividuals, the cells. But it was more significant on the spiritual\r\nside. The individual human soul could be analysed into millions of\r\nsmaller psychic individualities, the cell-souls, of which it was the\r\nsum. The unified ego, the consciousness of self and unity of the psychic\r\nclamp, “man,” remained as the connection of all the cell-souls. A ray of\r\nlight was thrown on the deep mystery of the _origin_ of individualities,\r\nmaterial and spiritual. Haeckel devoted himself afterwards to the\r\nquestion with all his energy. But at the time it was Virchow who,\r\nunconsciously enough, started the great wave that welled up from the\r\ndepths of his theory.\r\n\r\nHe had marked out his path very clearly in the first part of his speech.\r\nScientific research collects facts. It puts them before us without any\r\nreference to philosophy. The less philosophy there is in the\r\ninvestigation of facts the better. But the other side of the matter is\r\nthat no power in heaven or on earth has anything to say as regards its\r\nwork on things that it holds to be facts. The only possible logical\r\nconclusion from this, with reference to the question of the cell-soul,\r\nwas for the investigator of facts to say: Even in respect of the psychic\r\nlife we go our way and look neither to right nor left, whatever\r\nconclusions and assumptions the philosopher makes. Virchow acted very\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\nHe first grants that this dissolution of man into a federal unity of\r\ncountless cells _must_ somehow affect the “unified soul.” We are\r\ncompelled “to set up a plurality even in the psychic life.” He has\r\nreached the limit of his radicalism. We expect him to continue: Hence,\r\nas in the case of the Mosaic story of creation, of Darwinism, of the\r\ncell-theory as a whole, so here we men of science go our way unmoved;\r\neven if the whole of the teaching that has hitherto prevailed in\r\nphilosophy and theology in regard to the soul breaks down, we simply go\r\nour way, and do not ask anybody’s permission. This he does not do. Take\r\none step further, he says, and we “can easily believe that it is\r\nnecessary to split up our whole psychic life in this way and ascribe a\r\nsoul to each individual cell.” Haeckel believed a little later that this\r\n_was_ necessary; that the most rigorous logic compelled us to do it.\r\nBut, says Virchow suddenly, we must protest most vigorously against\r\nthis. This deduction from the cell-state theory reaches a point where\r\n“science is incompetent,” namely, “the facts of consciousness.” Taboo!\r\nThe path of the scientific inquirer is barricaded. What follows rests on\r\nno scientific grounds, but is a sort of confession. Up to the present\r\nnatural science has not been able to say anything as to the real nature,\r\nthe locality, and the ground of consciousness. “Hence I have always said\r\nthat it is wrong to refuse to recognise the peculiar character of these\r\nfacts of consciousness that dominate our whole higher life, and to yield\r\nto the personal craving to bring these facts of consciousness into\r\naccord with an independent soul, a spiritual force, and let the\r\nindividual formulate his religious feeling according to his conscience\r\nand disposition. That is, I think, the point where science makes its\r\ncompromise with the Churches, recognising that this is a province that\r\neach can survey as he will, either putting his own interpretation on it\r\nor accepting the traditional ideas; and it must be sacred to others.”\r\nThe direction of the logic is clear enough. The application of the\r\ncell-state theory to psychic life must lead to the problem of\r\nconsciousness. But we must not follow it, because science has never yet\r\npenetrated into this province. It is the province of peaceful compromise\r\nwith “the Church,” and we must respect it.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the explanation is clear. The whole field of\r\nconflict that Haeckel found _within_ the science of his time is opened\r\nout, though Virchow was by no means disposed at that time to take\r\nDarwinism as an example of the thing to be avoided, as he did at Munich\r\nfourteen years afterwards. The kind of scientific inquiry that Virchow\r\nadvocated is what was called “exact” at a later period. It kept clear of\r\nall philosophical speculation, and repeated over and over again that it\r\nwas only concerned with facts. It had, however, another card to\r\nplay—peace with “the Churches.”\r\n\r\nPhilosophy was shunned in order to leave a free field for the Churches\r\nto build in. Then the exact scientist took his hat and said, I am afraid\r\nI am incompetent, and the philosopher is incompetent, to do anything\r\nhere; let the Church take the vacant chair, with my compliments. No\r\nphilosophy: on this we will make war to the knife. This is “a point\r\nwhere science makes its compromise with the Churches.” No one can\r\nunderstand Haeckel’s career who does not grasp this antithesis. The\r\ncontrast between Haeckel and Virchow, known to all the world since 1877,\r\nis clearly indicated. Virchow’s speech in 1877 is obscure. We must go\r\nback to 1863 to get behind the veil—the veil that hides Virchow, that is\r\nto say, the most prominent representative of the hostility to Haeckel.\r\nWe cannot understand otherwise how this yawning gulf came about between\r\nHaeckel’s ideas and a school that professed to follow “exact” research.\r\nHaeckel was building up a natural philosophy which, starting from the\r\nsolid foundation of scientific research and its results, went on to\r\nfurther, and greater, and more far-reaching issues, that could not be\r\nseen, but could be reached philosophically by more or less happy\r\ndeductions from the scientific data. It might or might not have lasting\r\nvalue in points of detail. He was subject to the law of evolution. He\r\nworked with analogy, and the things he compared thereto were ever\r\nchanging. It was all the same to him. In any case the dawning glimmer of\r\nthe perfect light broadened out and lit up vague outlines even in the\r\ncloud-wreathed unknown. The others worked in such a way as to leave\r\nbeside them provinces of a virgin whiteness, untouched by thought or\r\nlogic. At times they slipped into these provinces, and celebrated their\r\nreconciliation-festival with “the Churches.” The layman continued to\r\nthink that the Churches wielded an absolute authority; that the\r\nscientist, abandoning his natural philosophy, came to pay them tribute.\r\nThis situation has done infinite mischief, more than the wildest and\r\neven obviously perverse philosophy ever did. It put the scientist in the\r\nposition of a tolerated vassal in the world of thought—the world that\r\nthe Churches had held in chains for ages. Woe to the man who ventured to\r\ndiscuss “consciousness”! Not because science had but the slender\r\nproportions of a pioneer in that field, and because there was a danger\r\nof it making great mistakes with its natural philosophy. No, but because\r\nthe white neutral field began here that we had agreed to respect—we\r\n“exact” scientists and “the Churches.” This was the real reason why\r\nVirchow and so many others who advocated the strict investigation of\r\nfacts had forfeited the right to oppose Haeckel’s bolder natural\r\nphilosophy and its conclusion—will have forfeited the right, at least,\r\nin the judgment of a future and more impartial generation. They did not\r\noppose him on the lines of an equal zeal for the truth, but on much\r\nlower and reactionary lines. Their concern was not for the absolute\r\ntriumph of truth, but for a compromise with certain forces in public\r\nlife whose supremacy was not grounded on logic but on inherited external\r\npower. It required a certain amount of diplomatic shrewdness to enter\r\ninto this compromise, in view of the practical power of those forces.\r\nHaeckel never had this “shrewdness.” We grant that. But it is certainly\r\na confusion of all standards when the shrewdness of the individual tries\r\nto entrench itself behind ostensible claims of scientific method; when\r\nresearch abandons all advance on certain sides on the plea of\r\n“exactness” instead of philosophising—and then itself makes use of this\r\nexactness for compromising with an ecclesiastical tradition that only\r\ndiffers from real philosophy in its antiquity and rigidity, its disdain\r\nof rational argument, and its employment of secular weapons that certain\r\nhistorical events have put in its hand without any merit on its own\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThe darkest cloud that hung menacingly on the horizon of Darwinism came\r\nfrom this quarter. At the moment we are dealing with it did not cause\r\nmuch concern. This early Darwinism thrilled with optimism as with the\r\nmagic of spring. Haeckel had to speak once more in the course of the\r\nCongress. The geologist, Otto Volger, made a polite but energetic\r\nprotest against the new theory in the final sitting. It was a curious\r\nconnection of things that brought Volger into such a position.\r\n\r\nVolger is the man who saved for Germany the venerable Goethe-house at\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main. The Free German Chapter received it from him as a\r\ngift. The action has nothing to do with geology, but it stands in the\r\nannals of culture. Thus the shadow of Goethe came to Stettin, to be\r\npresent at the open birth of German Darwinism—Goethe, who had once stood\r\non the very brink of the evolutionary ideas. And the man who brought him\r\nwas a geologist who felt moved to attack the ideas of Darwin and\r\nHaeckel!\r\n\r\nNo part of science became in the succeeding decades so fruitful for\r\nDarwinistic purposes as geology. It might very well be called a\r\ncontinuous argument for Darwin; from the little slab of Solenhofen\r\nJurassic schist that yielded, in 1861, the first impression of the\r\narcheopteryx, the real connecting link between the lizard and the bird,\r\nto the incomparable discoveries of Othniel Marsh, Cope, and Ameghino in\r\nAmerica, which put whole sections of the genealogical tree of the\r\nmammals before us, on to the skull and thighbone of the ape-man\r\n(pithecanthropus) of Java, found by Eugen Dubois, which brings so\r\nvividly home to us the transition from the gibbon to man. But, as if it\r\nhad been scared away by the new idea of evolution and its demand for\r\nproof, the most and the best of this material was not forthcoming until\r\nafter Darwin was pretty firmly established everywhere. At the earlier\r\ndate we are dealing with it was quite possible for a geologist to play\r\nthe sceptic with a shadow of justification. We need not go into the\r\npoint to-day. It is ancient history. But there is an incidental point in\r\nVolger’s criticism and the reply it provoked from Haeckel that calls for\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nVolger declared that Darwinism in general was an unsupported hypothesis,\r\nbut he made a concession. The species of animals and plants need not be\r\nabsolutely unchangeable. The only thing that is impossible is a\r\ncontinuous upward direction in evolution. All the groups of living\r\nthings, even the highest, may have been present together from the\r\nearliest days. Local changes in the distribution of land and water, &c.,\r\nmust have brought about a certain amount of variation in life-forms. But\r\nafter brief divergences all would return to the original type. The\r\nproper symbol of the story of life is the wave that rises out of the sea\r\nand sinks back into it. There was no such thing as a steady advance, a\r\nwave that never sank back into the water. The real image of human life\r\nis the analogy of its obvious development: youth, maturity, then old age\r\nand back once more. The speaker urged in plausible terms that this\r\nconception retained the idea of an “eternal becoming,” which is better\r\nthan a rigid fulfilment. As if an eternally advancing evolution did not\r\ninclude this “eternal becoming.” Haeckel spoke immediately after Volger.\r\nHe not only attacked the weak points of the geologist, but went on to\r\nthe deeper philosophic question. The notion of a “perennial circular\r\nmovement” is “inconsistent with all the facts of human history.” “If we\r\nappeal to sentiment, I must say that this circular theory has no\r\nattraction for me, whereas the Darwinian idea of a progressive evolution\r\nseems the only one consistent with the nature of man.” The story of the\r\nanimals and plants is subject to “the law of progress” just as much as\r\nhuman history.\r\n\r\nIn these words of Haeckel’s we have a clear indication of the optimistic\r\ntemper of Darwinism at the time. They touch a question of fundamental\r\nimportance for the value of the new theory: the question whether, in\r\nspite of all it destroyed, in spite of its disseverance from the idea of\r\nGod, it brought with it a new ground of conciliation, a conviction of\r\nthe ever-advancing growth of the world and ever greater achievements?\r\nGod was replaced by natural law. There was no longer any “design” beyond\r\nthe simple and unchanging course of natural laws. Well, what were these\r\nnatural laws going to do for us? Were they giving us a world that would\r\nbecome more and more harmonious, that was on the whole an advancing\r\norganism, that would be an increasing embodiment of God—the God within\r\nnature, not without, God at the end of things, after æons of worlds that\r\nseemed to break up like the individual in the struggle for existence,\r\nyet were eternal in the mighty essence that was tossed on from world to\r\nworld like a grain of dust and was made the starting-point of infinitely\r\nnew and more complex movements? Or—was the work of these natural laws\r\nbut a ceaseless poking and thrusting and bubble-blowing without any\r\ninner meaning? Was it the play of waves that rise and fall, and rise and\r\nfall again, in the ocean, an eternal melting into smoke and nothingness?\r\nWas the whole of “evolution” an absolutely meaningless play of\r\ninnumerable tendencies, not one of which would ever come to anything?\r\n\r\nThis note also was found in the first melody. Something would have been\r\nlacking if it had not been struck. Here again there could be a parting\r\nof ways, not only in the crowd, but amongst the thoughtful. The whole\r\nstruggle of optimism and pessimism might be dragged in. At all events,\r\nthe problem was bound to be pointed out from the start.\r\n\r\nWhen Volger, not a bad opponent at the bottom, and Haeckel had made\r\ntheir speeches, indicating at once certain lasting antitheses within the\r\nsubtle philosophy of Darwinism, Virchow closes the debates and the\r\nCongress with a most dangerous blessing. In essentials he is once more\r\non the side of Haeckel. He suggests that geology should be allowed to\r\nmature a little before final judgment is passed. The strongest evidence\r\nfor evolution is found in embryology (the science of the embryonic forms\r\nand uterine development of living species of animals). The prophecy was\r\nfulfilled, if ever prophecy was, and in Haeckel’s own most particular\r\nfield of work. But, in fine—he returns to his point—the main thing is\r\nthe “pursuit of truth.” And since “the most earnest ecclesiastical\r\nteachers” declared that “God is truth,” he could not do better than\r\nclose with a reminder (I quote him _verbatim_) of “the compromise that\r\nmay be effected between science and the Church.” Translated into plain\r\nlanguage, that means: My dear children, fight it out as you will, but\r\nrespect the Church always as the main thing, and you will do well,\r\nhowever much you differ. Thus closed this remarkable Scientific\r\nCongress—as quietly as a bomb that smokes noiselessly, like a whiff from\r\na tobacco pipe. But one day it will burst.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                        THE “GENERAL MORPHOLOGY”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe speech at the Scientific Congress in 1863 was the first open\r\nconfession that Haeckel felt bound to make. But the real work for the\r\nnew ideas began on his return to Jena. Nothing was further from\r\nHaeckel’s thoughts at that time than the idea of becoming merely the\r\npopulariser of Darwinism in Germany. He has often been spoken of since\r\nin lay circles as such. It is entirely wrong. He had the courage to\r\nrecognise his debt whenever he contracted one; and certainly Darwin\r\nsupplied the groundwork of his colour-scheme. But he was much too\r\nindependent and individual in his nature not to take the axe in his own\r\nhand at once and begin to hew away himself.\r\n\r\nDarwin had strengthened his book with a large amount of the best\r\nmaterial that zoology and botany could supply. But there was something\r\nelse to be done: a theoretical treatment of a general character with\r\ncleverly grouped illustrations from the facts already provided by two\r\nsciences, and to reconstruct these sciences from their foundations on\r\nthe basis of the new theory. At that time Haeckel was doing an\r\nincredible amount of work, with body and mind. He had an iron\r\nconstitution. In the year of the Stettin speech he won a laurel crown at\r\nthe Leipsic athletic festival for the long jump, with a leap of twenty\r\nfeet. His physical strength seemed so inexhaustible that his host,\r\nEngelmann, put a pair of heavy iron dumb-bells in his bed, in case he\r\nshould want to take exercise during the night. He had a proportionate\r\nstrength of mind. Everything seemed to promise very well for the next\r\nfew years, so that he could devote his whole health and strength to the\r\ngreat task of his life. His teaching did not give him very much trouble\r\nin a small university like Jena, that was only just beginning to have a\r\nscientific name. The happiness of his home life, with a highly gifted\r\nwoman who shared all his ideas with the freshness of youth, began to\r\nchain the restless wanderer with pleasant bonds to his place. He, of\r\ncourse, expected to have his sea-holiday in the old way for the study of\r\nhis little marine treasures, but otherwise he remained quietly in the\r\nvalley of the Saale. The warmth of genial and most stimulating\r\nfriendships gathered about his life. With his comfortable material\r\nposition he set to work on his great task under the best auspices.\r\n\r\nHe would have had at the start material enough to work upon without\r\nDarwin. From Müller’s time he still had another special class of\r\nmaterial, similar to the radiolaria, the medusæ.\r\n\r\nThe ship cuts through the ocean. It rises like a lofty fortress from the\r\nillimitable blue plain, with the white clouds on the far horizon. No\r\nland has been in sight for days. Yesterday a poor wind-borne butterfly\r\nrested on the deck. To-day it is gone, and all is sea. Then they\r\nsuddenly appear silently in the blue mirror: mysterious discs, red as\r\nthe anemones on a Roman meadow in spring, golden as the autumn leaves on\r\na dark pond in the park, then blue, like a lighter blue floating on the\r\ngeneral azure. They are the medusæ. At one time the ship sails through a\r\nwhole swarm of them—thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, a\r\nveritable milky way of coloured stars. On the next day they have all\r\ngone. No inhabitant of the ocean seems to be so close to it as this\r\ncreature. The whole animal is only a shade more substantial than the\r\nwater. You take it out, and try to catch hold of it. It stings your hand\r\nlike a nettle: that is its one weapon. But it is already destroyed,\r\nmelted away, a formless nothing. You put it on a piece of\r\nblotting-paper, and it dries up into the spectral outline of a shadow, a\r\ntiny “fat-spot,” summary of its whole existence.\r\n\r\nYet this soap-bubble of the water is a real animal. Its transparent body\r\nis shaped like a bell, and moves through the water by regular\r\ncontraction and expansion, like the lung in breathing. Where the clapper\r\nof the bell should be, we find a stomach, with a mouth for eating,\r\nhanging down from the curved upper part. At the edge of the curved\r\nsurface are many long fibrils that close on the approaching prey and\r\nparalyse it by their sting. Then it thrusts it into its mouth and\r\nswallows the object into the stomach. The medusa is, of course, a very\r\nlowly creature, but it is much more advanced in organisation than the\r\ntiny radiolarian. The radiolarian consists of a single cell. The medusa\r\nis a cell-state, a community of countless cells with a division of\r\nlabour amongst them. Some of the cells form the wall of the bell, some\r\nthe stinging threads, some the devouring and digesting stomach. In this\r\nthe medusa comes nearer to man than the radiolarian. Some of the cells\r\nsee to the reproduction of the medusa. Ova and spermatozoa are detached\r\nfrom the cell-community of the medusa’s body, blend together, and thus\r\nform the germ of a new medusa. In most cases the process is curious\r\nenough. From the germ-cell we get at first, not a real medusa, but a\r\npolyp that attaches itself to the ground, a little creature that may be\r\nremotely compared to the pretty water-lilies that meet the eye in an\r\naquarium. Then the polyp produces something like a plant that grows\r\nbuds, the real medusæ; it may produce these out of its substance as\r\nbuds, and they then float away like detached flowers, or (in other\r\nspecies) it may gradually change itself into a chain of medusæ, of which\r\nthe uppermost is detached first, then the next, and so on.\r\n\r\nSince this peculiar method of reproduction became known, in the thirties\r\nor forties, the medusæ were regarded as amongst the most interesting\r\nobjects in the whole of zoology. They offered an extremely difficult\r\ntask to the investigator who would care to take up the study of them.\r\n\r\nWhen Haeckel was with Johannes Müller in Heligoland in 1854 he made\r\nacquaintance with them for the first time. His artistic eye was caught\r\nwith their beauty, as it was afterwards with the radiolaria. “Never\r\nshall I forget,” he says, “the delight with which, as a student of\r\ntwenty years I gazed on the first _Tiara_ and _Irene_ [species of\r\nmedusæ], and the first _Chrysaora_ and _Cyanea_, and endeavoured to\r\nreproduce their beautiful forms and colours.” His predilection for the\r\nmedusæ never disappeared. At Nice in 1856 he met them again in the\r\nMediterranean. Gegenbaur’s _Sketch of a Classification of the Medusæ_\r\nprovided his studies with a starting-point, just as Müller’s writings\r\ndid afterwards for the radiolaria. At Naples and Messina he completed\r\nhis mastery of them. When he had done with the radiolaria for the time\r\nafter publishing the great monograph of 1862, the next task that loomed\r\nup on his horizon was the need for a “monograph on the medusæ.” It would\r\nbe a long time, however, before he could complete the work in any\r\nfulness. A work of Agassiz that purported to do it, but, in his opinion,\r\nonly confused the subject—he disliked both the Agassizs, father and son,\r\nand the father became one of his bitterest opponents on the Darwinian\r\nquestion—gave him a negative impulse to the study. He thought it would\r\nbe best to deal with one family of the medusæ after another in separate\r\nmonographs, as time permitted. The first of these essays appeared in\r\n1864 and 1865, and dealt with what are known as the “snouted-medusæ”\r\n(_geryonidæ_). The first volume of the complete work was not published\r\nuntil fourteen years afterwards. If Haeckel had decided to work as a\r\nspecialist he would have had material enough here to occupy him fully\r\nthroughout the whole of the sixties, and even longer. The keen student\r\nof the radiolaria would be succeeded by the equally keen student of the\r\nmedusæ. More folio volumes would have accumulated, with beautiful\r\nplates, such as only the technical student of zoology ever takes out of\r\nthe library. His name, like that of his friend Gegenbaur almost, would\r\nnever have reached the crowd.\r\n\r\nIt was the influence of Darwin that prevented this. His attention was\r\nturned in another direction, and we begin to realise the full greatness\r\nof his power when we remember that he nevertheless continued with\r\nunfailing quality to publish such detailed studies as those on the\r\nmedusæ.\r\n\r\nDarwinian ideas were fermenting intensely in his mind at that time. The\r\nmost audacious practical and theoretical problems arose from the\r\nfundamental theory, and forced themselves on him at every moment. A\r\ngreat deal was sketched in outline in the Stettin speech, but the\r\nserious scientific work would have to be begun on his return to Jena, in\r\nhis view. First, he thought, two features of Darwin’s system must be\r\ngiven a completely new and original complexion. Firstly, the bottom of\r\nthe tree, where life begins. Secondly, the crown of all terrestrial\r\nevolution: the manner in which man is connected with the tree. It was\r\nhis philosophic vein that settled both points, the philosophy of unity\r\nthat sought to replace God by natural development, both below and above,\r\nin regard to the primitive cell and in regard to man. But the way in\r\nwhich he set about it was very far removed from all conventional\r\nphilosophy. The whole rigour of his professional zoology found\r\nexpression in it. And that was really the novelty of it. The same\r\nconclusions might have been drawn by any dozen ordinary philosophers,\r\nonce they got on the right track. Even they could see that, if two and\r\ntwo are four, one and one are two, and three times three nine. Haeckel\r\nwent very differently, and much more profoundly, to work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ERNST HAECKEL, 1890.\r\n  _From a relief-portrait modelled by Kopf, of Rome._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs an old pupil of Virchow’s he applies the cell-theory to Darwinism—in\r\nthe lower stage. The first living things, the roots of the great tree of\r\nlife, consisted of a single cell. The logic of the cell-theory itself\r\nwent as far as this. But is the individual cell the simplest of all\r\nliving forms? Here there was a long-standing controversy as to\r\ndefinitions. At first the cell was regarded literally as a kind of\r\nchamber, like the cell in the honeycomb. Then it was found that the\r\njelly-like, mobile matter within the cell-chamber was the essential\r\nelement, the vehicle of life. Finally, it was possible to conceive this\r\nslimy substance without any firm membrane, without a chamber. Inside it,\r\nhowever, there was always (it was then thought) a thick and hard\r\nsubstance, the nucleus. If that was the fundamental and only really\r\nessential form, the Darwinian primitive and initial type of all\r\nterrestrial life must have been a similar drop of living matter with a\r\nsolid central nucleus, a nucleated individual cell.\r\n\r\nHow could we pass from this primitive cell to the “inorganic,” the\r\n“lifeless,” the “dead,” the ordinary matter of stone, metal, and\r\ncrystal? Haeckel believed that it was possible to make a step in that\r\ndirection—not theoretically and philosophically, but practically—by\r\nshowing that there were still living things on the earth that did not\r\ncome up to the definition of a true cell, things that had not yet a\r\nnucleus in their soft gelatinous body. He discovered a number of tiny\r\ncreatures that had a homogeneous particle of living matter for body, and\r\nshowed no trace of a nucleus. The nucleus seemed to be the first\r\nbeginning of an organ. It was altogether wanting in them.\r\n\r\nTo these most primitive of all living things he gave the name of\r\n_monera_, or the absolutely “simple.”\r\n\r\nIn these investigations it is very difficult to determine whether one of\r\nthese tiny drops of plasm has a more or less transparent nucleus or not.\r\nIt has often been affirmed in later years that these monera of Haeckel’s\r\ndid not correspond to their description as living things without a\r\nnucleus, or creatures that were below the level of the true cell. It is,\r\nat all events, certain that there are to-day large numbers of the\r\nunicellular beings known as the bacteria in which no nucleus has yet\r\nbeen discovered by the most sceptical Thomas with the most powerful\r\nmicroscopes and best technical appliances of our time. It is the same\r\nwith the chromacea (chroococci, oscillaria, nostoc-algæ), very lowly\r\nprimitive plants whose whole body consists of a globule or granule of\r\nliving plasm. However, here again the question is no longer of the first\r\nimportance, now that evolution is entirely and generally accepted. At\r\nthe time we are discussing the method chosen was all-important. Haeckel\r\ndrew no conclusions without a solid basis. He believed he could give\r\nocular proof of the existence of beings that were below the level of the\r\ncell. It was clear, at all events, that research in this department was\r\nonly in its beginning, and could pour out wonder after wonder before the\r\nworld recovered from its first fright over Darwinism.\r\n\r\nThen there was the other end of the system—man. Here again it was not\r\nmerely a question of concluding on philosophic grounds that man _must_\r\nhave descended from the lower animals. Huxley had dealt in England with\r\nthe question of man and the ape on the strict lines of zoology. He came\r\nto the important conclusion that man differs _less_ zoologically from\r\nthe highest apes, the gorilla and chimpanzee, than they do from the\r\nlowest apes. He proved his point by a technical study of skulls and\r\nbrains, not from abstract philosophical principles. It could be\r\ndemonstrated in the museum or zoological institute to any student with\r\nsome knowledge of anatomy as easily as the existence and position of any\r\nparticular bone in the skeleton. Haeckel went even further.\r\n\r\nHe constructed a genealogical tree stretching far below the apes. Next\r\nto them came the lemurs. The lemur, the ghostly nocturnal inhabitant of\r\nMadagascar, came from the Australian marsupial (kangaroo, &c.). The\r\nmarsupial came from the duck-bill; the duck-bill from the lizard; the\r\nlizard from the salamander; the salamander from the dipneust or\r\nmud-fish; this from the sturgeon or the shark, and the shark from the\r\nlamprey. Below the lamprey, at the lowest limit of the vertebrate\r\nkingdom, was the amphioxus (or lancelet). This must have come from the\r\nworm—it was not at all clear how, at that time. And so the series ran on\r\ndown to the unicellular protozoa, the amœbæ and the monera.\r\n\r\nThe construction of this tree would have been impossible for one who had\r\nnot already done gigantic work. The whole of the new system of animals\r\nand plants, conceived in the form of a genealogical tree, had first to\r\nbe sketched in outline. Then the narrower thread that led up to man, the\r\nAriadne-thread of God-Nature, would gradually come to light.\r\n\r\nBoth ends of the system, the lower one in the monera, the upper one in\r\nman, were first thoroughly treated by him in 1865, and in part somewhat\r\nlater. His exhaustive _Monograph on the Monera_ was not published until\r\n1868. Man’s genealogical tree was privately circulated at Jena in two\r\nessays in October and November 1865. They were published in the\r\nVirchow-Holtzendorff collection in 1868 (“The Origin and Genealogical\r\nTree of the Human Race”). But in both cases the substance of the work,\r\nas an accumulation of facts, is much older. And this work was, of\r\ncourse, only possible in connection with a number of further\r\nconclusions: in regard to spontaneous generation, life and death, the\r\ncrystal and the cell, the mathematical form of organisms, the nature and\r\nlimits of individuality, the method of research, the new natural\r\nphilosophy, God, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt was an enormous programme, with a Paradisaic freshness. Everything\r\nwas new and great; and all came from one brain. There was only one man\r\nwith whom he discussed his ideas as they formed, Carl Gegenbaur, who has\r\nundoubtedly had a great, if unconscious, influence on them. Haeckel’s\r\ngrateful recognition of Gegenbaur’s help in later years was endless and\r\ntouching. “Thou it was,” he writes to him a little later, “that led me\r\nto begin my academic teaching at our beloved Jena six years ago, at the\r\nThuringian university in the heart of Germany, that has, like a beating\r\nheart, sent out its living waves of freedom and alertness of mind over\r\nGermany for three hundred years. At this nursery of German philosophy\r\nand science, under the protection of a free State whose princely rulers\r\never gave a refuge to free speech and have linked their names for ever\r\nwith the reform movement, the golden age of German poetry, I was able to\r\nwork in association with thee. Here we built up our common structure of\r\nscience in the happiest division of labour, teaching and learning\r\ncordially from each other, in the very rooms in which Goethe began his\r\nstudies of ‘the morphology of organisms’ a half-century before, and\r\npartly with the same scientific means, the germs of comparative and\r\nphilosophic science that he had scattered. We have shared with each\r\nother as brothers the happiness and the sorrow that came in the hard\r\nstruggle for life, and our scientific efforts have been so intimately\r\nblended and so mutually helpful, through our daily working and talking\r\ntogether, that it would have been impossible for either of us to\r\ndetermine the particular share of each in our spiritual communism. I can\r\nonly say in a general way that the little my restless and impulsive\r\nyouth could offer thee here and there is out of all proportion to the\r\nenormous amount I have received from thee, eight years my senior, a more\r\nexperienced and mature man.”\r\n\r\nGoethe stood behind the friends as the quiet _genius loci_, giving his\r\nblessing to all who worked in his spirit on the old spot. Nor was the\r\nplace itself without influence. “Much,” Haeckel writes, “may have been\r\neven the outcome of the common uplifting enjoyment of nature that was\r\nafforded us by the artistic lines of the Jena hills, as they brought\r\nbefore us once more at sunset the magic of the Calabrian mountains by\r\nthe colour-harmony of their purple and gold banks of cloud and their\r\nviolet shadows.”\r\n\r\n“What are the hopes, what are the plans, that man, the creature of a\r\nday, builds up?”\r\n\r\nThe words were written by a poet, in his fatal illness, at the spot\r\nwhere the two strong spirits now worked. In the midst of all his hopes\r\nand plans Haeckel was struck by a Niobe-shaft. On February 16th, 1864,\r\njust on his thirtieth birthday, his wife, only in her twenty-ninth year,\r\nin the full force of mind and of love, succumbed to blood-poisoning.\r\n\r\nI turn to the thick volume of Haeckel’s _Monograph on the Medusæ_. Part\r\nI.: “System of the Medusæ:” with an atlas of forty beautiful plates:\r\npublished by Gustav Fischer, of Jena, in 1879. Few people except\r\nzoologists with a technical interest in it have ever opened this\r\nvoluminous work—why should they? It is a heavy work, with dry diagnoses.\r\nThe author seems to be far away from all general questions, if ever he\r\nwas, in the utter stillness of his study. This pure accumulation of\r\nmatter for truth’s sake does not reach the ear of the world. It lays up\r\nmaterial for remote days, before which the individual fades away; it is\r\nmerely catalogued material of the most technical character. Yet, as I\r\nturn over the pages, I seem to see a little image from time to time that\r\nis almost like the rose-red or golden-brown medusæ in the sterile,\r\nillimitable ocean. In truth neither ocean nor book is sterile; but they\r\nare grey and broad. And just as the swimming medusa gladdens me in the\r\none, so a little personal trait of the author does in the other. It is\r\nin the choice of the Latin names. A little crown is woven that unites\r\næsthetics and science. I find splendid names, invented by the Professor,\r\non all sides. But I notice that his heart was in these things. He has\r\ndiscovered new species of medusæ, and must christen them. As he turns\r\nover his Latin or Greek lexicon a ray of humanity steals into the most\r\nsevere scientific soul at such moments. I read that a disco-medusa is\r\ncalled the _Nausicaa phæacum_: “I observed the _Nausicaa phæacum_ in\r\nApril, 1877, at Corfu, on the shore of Phæaca, in the heart of the\r\nNausicaa.” A cyaneid is given the fine name of the _Melusina formosa_.\r\nIt is noted, with great regret, that “so fine and classic a name for a\r\nmedusa” as _Oceania_ must be struck out on scientific grounds. Amongst\r\ndescriptions of species in a severe scientific tongue that unnerves the\r\ntimid reader, amongst gonods, styles, perradial bundles of tentacles,\r\nand ocellar bulbs, we find, _apropos_ of the medusa, _Lizzia\r\nElisabethæ_: “As Forbes dedicated the pretty genus _Lizzia blondina_ to\r\na ‘blond Elizabeth,’ I do the same, and wish to honour, not only St.\r\nElizabeth of Thuringia, but also the ‘blond Elizabeth’ of Immermann and\r\nmy own dear daughter Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\nThen, in the middle of the large volume, we find the following passage\r\non page 189. A medusa is given the name of _Mitrocoma Annæ_. The name\r\nwas given at Villefranche, near Nice, in April, 1864 This medusa had “a\r\nfairy-like appearance” to its discoverer; its tentacles hung down “like\r\na mass of blond hair!” A note to the name tells us that it was given “in\r\nmemory of my dear, never-to-be-forgotten wife, Anna Sethe. If it is\r\ngiven to me to do something during my earthly pilgrimage for science and\r\nhumanity, I owe it for the most part to the blessed influence of my\r\ngifted wife, who was torn from me by a premature end in 1864.” In the\r\n_Art-forms in Nature_, Haeckel’s work of 1899, we find a medusa\r\n_Desmonema Annasethe_ similarly—after thirty-five years—apostrophised:\r\n“The specific name of this pretty disco-medusa, one of the most\r\nbeautiful and interesting of all the medusaæ, immortalises the memory of\r\nAnna Sethe, the gifted and refined wife (born 1835, died 1864) to whom\r\nthe author of this work owes the happiest years of his life.”\r\n\r\nIf one would fathom the depths of human emotion one must reflect what\r\nthese words, in such a context, contain; it is the last gentle vibration\r\nof a most deep inner experience breaking out into this prosaic,\r\nscientific material. A medusa is a trivial, possibly a funny thing, to\r\nthe layman. The man of science looks deeper into it, and sees a\r\nwonderful revelation of nature; the eye of Goethe’s God shines on him\r\nfrom it. But when he has devoted years to the most careful study of it,\r\nit assumes also a naïve individual interest for him, as the companion of\r\nhis solitary hours of observation in the heart of nature, far from all\r\nthe whirl and bustle of the world. Only the deepest and most intimate\r\nfeelings break out in such moments. And here they have left their\r\nmonument—in a Latin name that science will go on coldly entering in its\r\ncatalogues for ages to come. It seems to me that this simple fact tells\r\nus more of the character of this true-hearted man, in whom nothing human\r\nwas lacking, than long narratives could.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the aged Sethe saw the break-up in 1806 of the State of Prussia, in\r\nthe invulnerability of which he had believed as a gospel, he sought\r\nrefuge in the comfort of work. “I succeeded in benumbing my mind: I\r\nexperienced in myself that hard work is a soothing balsam, co-operating\r\nwith our tardy healing force.” The grandson, wounded in a more terrible\r\nway and cut to the very heart, tried the same remedy.\r\n\r\nThirty years afterwards, when crowns were prepared and speeches\r\ndelivered in honour of Haeckel’s sixtieth birthday, when the whole of\r\nJena fêted him as their own, and the veil fell from his marble bust in\r\nthe Zoological Institute, to which seven hundred of the best known names\r\nin German and foreign science had contributed, the hero of it all went\r\nback to that dark hour. “I thought at the time that I could not survive\r\nthe blow, thought my life was closed, and purposed to bring together all\r\nthe new ideas that Darwin’s theory of evolution had evoked in me in a\r\nlast great work. That was the origin, amid bitter struggles, of the\r\n_Generelle Morphologie_. It was written and printed in less than a year.\r\nI lived the life of a hermit, gave myself barely three or four hours\r\nsleep a day, and worked all day and half the night. My habits were so\r\nascetic that I really wonder I am alive and well before you to-day.”\r\n\r\nIn his hour of collapse Haeckel sat down and wrote “the book of his\r\nlife.” There were only two alternatives for a book written in such\r\ncircumstances. It would be either very bad or very good. When a young\r\nman in his thirties throws himself into a great effort of this kind and\r\nwrites a work that he conceives as a testament—a work in which he will\r\nspeak for the last time, but will say everything—it is a desperate test\r\nof all that he has done in his three decades of life and is about to\r\ngive to the world. In this case the test succeeded beyond all\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nThe _General Morphology of Organisms_[2] was published in 1866, with the\r\nsub-title: “General elements of the science of organic forms,\r\nmechanically grounded on the theory of descent as reformed by Charles\r\nDarwin.” It consists of two thick volumes of small print, containing\r\nmore than 1,200 pages. The preface is dated September 14, 1866. It is\r\nnow one of the most important works in the whole mental output of the\r\nsecond half of the nineteenth century. In respect of method of\r\nscientific research it is a landmark by which we may characterise and\r\nappraise the whole half-century. For general biological classification\r\nit inaugurates a new epoch, as had been done fifty years before by\r\nCuvier, and again fifty years earlier by Linné. What it did for zoology\r\nin the narrow sense was thirty years afterwards summed up in one phrase\r\nby a writer of acknowledged competence, Richard Hertwig: “Few works have\r\ndone as much towards raising the intellectual level of zoology.” Among\r\nHaeckel’s own achievements, great and varied as they are, this work\r\noccupies the highest place. Setting aside certain special pieces of\r\nresearch, and regarding him mainly as a man of great ideas, we find his\r\nwhole programme in this work. The _History of Creation_, that has taken\r\nhis name far and wide over the globe beyond the frontiers of zoology, is\r\nonly an extract from this work. He put his heart in it. The others are\r\nonly the improved blood-vessels of his system of ideas, partly\r\nduplications, partly simplifications. I do not say this either in blind\r\nadmiration or in criticism, but as the expression of a plain fact.\r\nPosterity will turn to this work when, either in hostility or in\r\nsympathy, it wishes to appreciate Haeckel.[3]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  This work of Professor Haeckel’s has not been translated into English.\r\n  [Trans.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Professor Huxley described the _General Morphology_ as “one of the\r\n  greatest scientific works ever published.” [Trans.]\r\n\r\nHis contemporaries did not accept the work without difficulty. It came\r\nout without noise, exerted a tremendous influence in a quiet way, and at\r\nlast disappeared altogether from the bookshops. It is still attacked,\r\nbut has never been refuted. At libraries one finds, as I know from\r\nexperience, that it is always “out,” and therefore must be read\r\ncontinually. It is found occasionally at second-hand booksellers; an\r\nantiquarian price running to five pounds and more is put on it, after\r\nforty years’ active production on the part of its author. At present you\r\ncould count on your fingers the German works that have this distinction\r\nof being highly priced and out of print. One such is Vischer’s\r\n_Æsthetics_, and another is the first edition of Gottfried Keller’s\r\n_Green Henry_. Keller had threatened any one who ever attempted to\r\nrepublish this first edition (afterwards modified but not improved by\r\nhim) that their hand would not rest quietly in the grave. But the price\r\nof the work went up amongst antiquarians. I feel, in speaking of\r\nHaeckel’s _General Morphology_, that I am describing a book which has\r\nbecome so rare that one must treat it as something new, a codex that is\r\nonly accessible to a few. It is certainly not known to the general\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nLet me endeavour in a few words to give a general idea of the chief\r\ncontents of the work.\r\n\r\nAll the intellectual forces that had had any influence upon Haeckel now\r\nconcentrated for a supreme achievement. First of these was Goethe, who\r\nsupplied the title, “Morphology.” In its simplest signification\r\nmorphology is merely “the science of forms.” If I take houses,\r\nfurniture, statues, fishes, flowers, crystals, &c., and only regard and\r\ndescribe their forms, I am a morphologist in the literal sense of the\r\nword. But when Goethe invented the term he sought to give it a more\r\nrestricted application, writing in the style of earlier days, but\r\nclearly enough, at Jena in 1807. We have, he says, natural objects\r\nbefore us, especially living objects. We try to penetrate the secrets of\r\ntheir nature and their action. We are not merely observers, but\r\nphilosophers. It is from this point of view that we approach the\r\nsubject. It appears to us that the best way to proceed is to separate\r\nthe various parts. Such a procedure seems calculated to take us very\r\nfar. Chemistry and anatomy are instances of this analytic kind of\r\nresearch, and both are greatly esteemed and successful. But this method\r\nhas its limitations. “We can easily break up the living thing into its\r\nelements, but we cannot put these together again and restore them to\r\nlife. We cannot do this in the case of many inorganic, to say nothing of\r\norganic, bodies.” What are we to do? “Hence,” Goethe continues, “even\r\nscientific men have at all times had an impulse to recognise living\r\nthings as such, to grasp connectedly their external visible and tangible\r\nparts, and take these as indications of the inner life, and thus in a\r\nsense to compass the whole in one glance.” “Hence we find at the\r\nthreshold of art and knowledge and science a number of attempts to\r\nestablish and elaborate a science that we may call _morphology_.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps Goethe’s meaning can be realised best if one takes a great work\r\nof art—say, the Venus of Milo—and imagines how these different kinds of\r\nknowledge would deal with it. Purely analytic anatomy would dissolve the\r\nsuperb artistic form into a rubbish-heap of bits of marble. Chemistry\r\nwould still further break up these bits of marble into the chemical\r\nelements of which every block of marble is ultimately composed. The\r\n“form” would disappear altogether. But in this case the form means—the\r\nVenus of Milo. We see at once that we need another branch of science and\r\ninvestigation besides anatomy and chemistry: we need a morphology, or\r\nscience of the complete form in which the block of marble is moulded\r\ninto the Venus of Milo. In the case of our work of art, morphology would\r\nbe identical with æsthetics, or at least with a branch of it. There can\r\nbe no doubt that the first and most imperative need for the\r\nestablishment of a special science of morphology arises from artistic\r\nand æsthetic feelings. It is not without significance that it was\r\nfounded by the poet Goethe, and elaborated with such great success in\r\nthe nineteenth century by the born artist Haeckel. However, that does\r\nnot prevent the analogy of the Venus of Milo, which happens to be a\r\ncreation of human art, being applied equally to every individualised\r\nform in nature, to every crystal, plant, and animal. Goethe himself\r\nimmediately transferred his morphology into the province of botany with\r\nsuch vigour that the term is still regarded, in its narrower sense, as a\r\ntechnical botanical expression. It extends, however, to the whole world\r\nin so far as its contents come before us in “forms.” When Haeckel\r\nadopted the term he deliberately restricted it, in harmony with the\r\ngeneral definition, by calling his work the “Morphology of Organisms,”\r\nor the science of the forms of animals and plants.\r\n\r\nBut there was one danger in the conception of a morphology of animals\r\nand plants, namely, the danger of taking it to mean a purely external\r\ndescription: so many thousand species of plants, soberly described,\r\nlabelled, and numbered, a huge cabinet of stuffed skins, a herbarium of\r\nhay. A whole scientific school had really taken it in this sense since\r\nGoethe’s time; much as if one were to think æsthetics consisted simply\r\nin forming an illustrated catalogue of all the art-treasures in the\r\nworld, a realistic catalogue in which the marble statues from the\r\nParthenon and the Moses of Michael Angelo would simply be given as\r\nnumber so-and-so in class so-and-so.\r\n\r\nHaeckel was preserved from this school by his more immediate masters, as\r\nwell as by Goethe himself; firstly by Johannes Müller, then by the\r\nbotanist Schleiden, finally by the influence of Gegenbaur. There was at\r\nthe time enough, and more than enough, of this external\r\nmuseum-morphology. It was far from Haeckel’s intention to produce a new\r\ncompendium, in several volumes, of this kind of science of plants and\r\nanimals. His morphology was to be “general,” to have a broader range, be\r\na programme. As Richard Hertwig said very happily at a later date, he\r\nsaw his science, not as it then was, but as it _ought_ to be, in his\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThe science of forms was to be in the fullest sense a “philosophy of\r\nforms.” “Zoological philosophy” was the name given by the hapless\r\nLamarck, in France a century ago, to a work that appeared in the year\r\nthat Darwin was born, and anticipated his most advanced thoughts.\r\nHaeckel, also, gave a new “philosophy of zoology and botany.” The title\r\nembodies the magic formula that gave him courage to take up resolutely\r\nonce more the proscribed word, that seemed to have been scalded and\r\nspoiled for ever in the witches’ cauldron of “natural philosophy”; it\r\nspoke of the “theory of descent as reformed by Charles Darwin.” Two\r\nsub-titles divided the work into two sections from the start. The first\r\npart was, the critical elements of the mechanical science of the\r\ndeveloped forms of organisms (animal and plant); the second part was,\r\nthe same elements of the mechanical science of the developing forms of\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nIn these titles we see the decisive advance beyond Johannes Müller. As\r\nGoethe had already declared, morphology as such can be formed into a\r\nreal and profound science. It will then not confine itself pedantically\r\nto a registration of forms. It will compare them with each other, and\r\nseek the hidden law in the straggling phenomena. It will mark out broad\r\nlines that will enable the human mind to grasp its objects in all their\r\nfulness. Johannes Müller had only been able to confirm that in the\r\nnarrower sphere of biology. This was the nerve that gave vitality to\r\nzoology and botany, and made them a province of the mind in the higher\r\nsense. But the question now was: which laws were detected, and in which\r\ncategory of thought were they to be found? Müller had the theory, but\r\nwas weak on the practical side. There were the “forms” of animals and\r\nplants. What was it that really connected them? What was the reality\r\nthat corresponded to the philosophic craving of the intelligence?\r\nMüller’s next school, the generation immediately preceding Haeckel, that\r\nof Du Bois-Reymond, Virchow, and many others, had apparently indicated\r\nthe solution. They had replaced Müller’s vague general conception of the\r\nlaws of morphology and life, which was undermined by older influences,\r\nby a single great demand. We want to grasp nature as a unity. At one\r\npoint in nature we have reached deep and apparently fundamental\r\nfactors—in physics and chemistry and their plain natural laws or forces.\r\nNow let us try, starting from the idea of unity and from the plainest of\r\nall philosophical principles, that of proceeding from the known to the\r\nunknown, to reduce the forms and phenomena of life to these natural laws\r\nof chemistry and physics. Let us find out whether the whole form-world\r\nof the animals and plants—in other words, the whole province of\r\nmorphology in the narrower sense—can be traced to the same natural laws\r\nthat we have in chemical and physical phenomena. The globe is the object\r\nof chemistry and physics. Shall these few green or other-coloured things\r\nthat lie at the limit of the air, water, and rocks, a small minority in\r\nnature, the things we call animals and plants, alone in the whole world\r\nbe exempt from the action of these laws? It is immaterial that Müller’s\r\nbest pupils, Du Bois in his later years and Virchow at an early date,\r\ndeparted more or less from this consistent position of theirs into\r\nphilosophic and other sidepaths. The younger generation, to which\r\nHaeckel belongs, that only came into direct touch with Müller in his\r\nlast years, heard no other gospel. What further advance was to be made?\r\nIn chemistry and physics they had before them the deep stratum that\r\nyielded good mechanical laws. The first stage of physiology after\r\nMüller, as we find it, for instance, under Du Bois-Reymond, yielded some\r\ngood indications for the organic. But was the whole of morphology to be\r\nremodelled? Was the vast labyrinth of the thousands and thousands of\r\nanimal and plant forms in the museum to be reduced to mechanical laws,\r\ncorresponding to those of physics and chemistry, and be explained by\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nDarwin brought salvation. Now that he had appeared, Haeckel felt that he\r\ncould begin to work. The hour and the man were come.\r\n\r\nDarwin made it possible for him to raise morphology to a penetrative\r\nscience, equal to physics and chemistry, and so to make a step towards\r\nthe unity of our knowledge of a unified world. Hitherto the morphology\r\nof the animals and plants had been in confusion. God, imagined in the\r\nform of a higher man, had deliberately created the organic forms, the\r\npalm, the moss, the turtle, and the man. He had constructed them on a\r\ndefinite plan, as a man makes machines. Now, it appeared, the deeper\r\nstratum was peeping out even here. Laws that had built the heavens and\r\nthe earth reached, by way of the Darwinian theories of selection and\r\nadaptation, to the moss and palm, the turtle and man.\r\n\r\nIt was Haeckel’s peculiar distinction to take up this path as the right\r\none. It was then altogether new; to-day, even in the eyes of an\r\nopponent, it has at least the solid and consistent support of a\r\nconsiderable party. In later years, apart from open deserters from the\r\nfree and uncompromising pursuit of truth like Virchow, a school of\r\nzoologists and botanists has been formed that will not recognise in\r\nDarwinism a reduction of vital phenomena to the simple chemico-physical\r\nlaws of the rest of nature. They look upon it partly as inaccurate in\r\nits allegations of fact, partly as a nebulous confusion, if not, as I\r\nhave already said, as a false mysticism or metaphysic. In the opinion of\r\nthese critics, whose own confused ideas very often leave little to be\r\ndesired in point of nebulosity, and who frequently try to drive out the\r\ndevil by means of the devil’s grandmother (a matter we cannot go into\r\nhere), Haeckel had made a great mistake in thinking that Darwinism would\r\nsolve the Du Bois-Virchow problem of reducing all living things to the\r\nlaws of lifeless matter. Even these, however, must candidly acknowledge\r\nthat in doing so he was the victim of his consistent and honourable\r\ninquiry. At all events he must logically have seen the correct line at\r\nthat time as it is recognised to-day by this anti-Darwinian but\r\nprofessedly mechanical school. His individual error can only have been\r\nthat he was deceived as to the true course of the line, and so clung to\r\nDarwinism. However, we have said enough on this point.\r\n\r\nHaeckel himself, at the time he was producing his greatest work, saw in\r\nDarwin the absolute “open Sesame” to all the doors of philosophic\r\nmorphology. With this Sesame came an entirely new impulse, namely, to\r\nwrite the natural history of the animal and plant form. It was just the\r\nsame as when æsthetics perceives a new world, a world that alone is\r\nworthy of it, the moment it passes from the making of a mere catalogue\r\nof the world’s art-treasures to the knowledge of even one single law of\r\nartistic creation, in virtue of which one single work of art has been\r\nactually built up.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to begin with more general considerations than this\r\nbook does. The method of scientific research generally is explained in\r\norder to give an idea of the new Darwinian morphology. With a calmness\r\nthat must have made most of the contemporary zoologists and botanists\r\nshiver, the discredited idea of natural philosophy is restored from the\r\nlumber-room. “All true science is philosophy, and all true philosophy is\r\nscience. And in this sense all true science is natural philosophy.”\r\n\r\nThe various periods in the development of morphology are coolly\r\nschematised. These epochs are characterised by the vicissitudes of the\r\nstruggle between the simple description of forms in the animal and plant\r\nworlds and the philosophic exposition of the laws that lie behind these\r\nforms. In the eighteenth century, under Linné, there is a period of\r\npurely external description and classification. It is succeeded in the\r\nfirst third of the nineteenth century by a triumph of the philosophic\r\ntreatment of animal and plant forms. This increases with Goethe and\r\nLamarck, and grows into the older (and now generally abused) imaginative\r\nnatural philosophy. Then there is a general reaction; with Cuvier comes\r\nthe least philosophical of methods, though at the time it is a real\r\nadvance. While Linné only gave an external description of forms and\r\ncatalogued them, Cuvier’s epoch penetrated to the inner structure, the\r\ninner world of forms, and thus rendered great service. The last and\r\ngreatest workers of the period, Müller, Schleiden, &c., give the signal\r\nfor a reaction in the hour of its chief triumph. Haeckel now follows\r\nthis up as “the element of fact in their ideas.” With Darwin he\r\ninaugurates the fourth epoch, the triumph of natural philosophy for the\r\nsecond time. But it is now far deeper and clearer; it embodies all the\r\ngood that preceded, all that Cuvier and his followers have done, without\r\nthe irresolution of earlier days. Now that we have studied the living\r\nform in its innermost structure, as was never done before, in the\r\nearliest stages of embryonic development in the ovum and womb, in the\r\npast geological periods of the earth’s history, we will _think_ over\r\nthis form, think with all the means at our command, reason,\r\nsynthesis—even _imagination_, when it is necessary to press on to the\r\ngreat final conclusion, a new synthesis of the defective positive data.\r\nWhat does Johannes Müller say? “Imagination is an indispensable servant;\r\nit is by means of it we make the combinations that lead to important\r\ndiscoveries. The man of science needs, in harmonious co-operation, the\r\ndiscriminating force of the analytic intelligence and the generalising\r\nforce of the synthetic imagination.” That is spoken from the depths of\r\nHaeckel’s heart, and he drives it home.\r\n\r\nNothing is more amusing than to find Haeckel’s later opponents saying,\r\n_apropos_ of any particular question, that his statement springs from\r\nhis “imagination,” as if it were something wholly unscientific that the\r\nnaturalist must shun like the pest; or again, that Haeckel here or there\r\nfalls a victim to the deadly enemy of all scientific research, natural\r\nphilosophy. It is pointed out to him as a great discovery which he must\r\napproach in a proper penitential spirit—to him who has discussed these\r\nmatters so unequivocally in his first theoretical work.\r\n\r\nAs a fact, these methodological chapters in the first volume are as\r\nclear as crystal. The titles will seem strange to the man who thinks he\r\ncan do without any philosophical instruction in zoology and botany, and\r\nwants to hear only of cells, tissues, stalks, leaves, bones, scales, and\r\nso on, in a general morphology. One chapter has the heading: “Empiricism\r\nand Philosophy (Experience and Knowledge).” Another heading runs:\r\n“Analysis and Synthesis.” Then there are: “Induction and Deduction,”\r\n“Dogmatism and Criticism,” “Teleology and Causality (Vitalism and\r\nMechanism),” “Dualism and Monism.” The last three antithetic headings\r\nare united under a general title as “Critique of Scientific Methods that\r\nare Mutually Exclusive.” Such a title illumines the whole situation like\r\na flash of lightning. Many years afterwards Haeckel himself said of his\r\n_General Morphology_ that it was a comprehensive and difficult work that\r\nhad found few readers. At least the whole of this first and most\r\ndifficult part of the book must be defended against the criticism of its\r\nparent. If it is far from adequately appreciated to-day, especially by\r\nprofessional philosophers, that is certainly not due to its style, which\r\nis a model of clearness in the eyes of any one with the least\r\nphilosophical culture. The real evil was that people did not look to it\r\nfor instruction from the philosophical side. The title, “Morphology of\r\nOrganisms,” had a technical sound. The empty space between professional\r\nphilosophy and professional zoology is wide enough to-day, but it was\r\nfar wider thirty-four years ago. Books like Büchner’s superficial and\r\npopular _Force and Matter_, or Haeckel’s own later work, the _History of\r\nCreation_, that can only be regarded as a brief and incomplete popular\r\nextract in comparison with the _General Morphology_, with all its\r\npeculiar literary charm, stole into the philosophy of the time like\r\nfoxes with burning straw tied to their tails. Professional philosophers\r\nhave written whole libraries on them. The matter recalls a fundamental\r\ndefect in academic philosophy: it has little or no sympathy with real\r\nscientific work; in fact, it studiously avoids such sympathy in the\r\nconsciousness of its own weakness. Hence it has, like every other layman\r\nwith general interests, to wait for attempts to popularise scientific\r\nwork before it can know what is going on in the serious camp. The man\r\nwho wants to-day to criticise the mechanical conception of nature should\r\nfirst make himself acquainted with these chapters of the _Morphology_.\r\nHow many know the mere title of the work? How many even of those who\r\nevince great hostility whenever Haeckel’s name is mentioned?\r\n\r\nThe book contains much more than the methodological introduction. This\r\nonly takes up the first hundred pages, but it contains the whole\r\nprogramme. We start off, therefore, under full sail for a new epoch of\r\nthought, for natural philosophy; but we must keep an alert mind. The\r\ndeeper task, that Darwin only gave the means of accomplishing, was to\r\nreduce all living things, animal or vegetal, to the inorganic. The laws\r\nof life must be merely certain complications of the simple laws that are\r\nencountered directly in chemistry and physics, and rule throughout\r\nnature. It must be one of the first aims of a general philosophic\r\nmorphology to open out a path in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe living and what is called the “dead” must be compared. Linné’s three\r\nrigid kingdoms—animal, plant, and mineral—needed definitions in harmony\r\nwith the new ideas. Haeckel himself had discovered the “monera,” the\r\nliving particles of plasm that did not seem to have reached the stage of\r\nthe true cell. Here, clearly, was the lowest level of the living. At the\r\nsame time we reach the most complex specimen of the inorganic from the\r\nmorphological point of view—that is to say, the most interesting in its\r\nindividual form—the crystal. The differences begin to give way. What\r\nmarvellously similar functions! From the dead mother-water is built up,\r\npurely by chemico-physical laws, the beautiful structure of the crystal.\r\nFrom the lowest living particle of plasm without any special organs, as\r\nwe see in the radiolaria, are formed the beautiful siliceous frames that\r\nHaeckel had collected in such quantities at Messina. Is it more than a\r\nhair’s breadth to pass from one to the other? The deeper we go in the\r\nstudy of living things, the slighter become the differences that\r\nseparate them from “dead matter.” On the other hand, the higher we go in\r\nthe structure of crystals, the more striking is the resemblance to the\r\nliving thing. Two chains of thought seem to be started. What we call\r\n“dead” is really alive: what we call living is really subject to the\r\nsame laws as the “dead.” The solution is found in complete Monism.\r\nLiving and dead are not antithetic. Nature is one; though we see it in\r\ndifferent stages of development. We call one of them the crystal,\r\nanother the cell, or the moneron, or the protozoon; another the plant,\r\nanother the animal. Historically it all hangs together. The same laws\r\nhold sway throughout. In framing my arbitrary definitions I can say\r\neither that the dead is living, or that the living does not differ\r\nessentially from the dead. In the chain of living things man comes from\r\nthe primitive cell, the moneron. This in its turn has developed from\r\nsomething earlier—“naturally” developed. The very idea of life forces us\r\nto seek the predecessors of the monera. Hence we speak of “spontaneous\r\ngeneration,” as what was dead according to our ordinary use of language\r\nhas begun to live. In point of fact it is merely development of a\r\nunified whole. There is no gap, no leap, no act that is not natural. The\r\ndead and the living never were really antithetic.\r\n\r\nThe insistent statement that not only does the living approach the\r\ninorganic, but the inorganic approaches the living, is quite\r\n“Haeckelian.” The study of the “life” of crystals is one of the best\r\nparts of the book. Later generations will appreciate it. We are much too\r\nnarrow to-day when we merely reflect that life, even the life of man,\r\ncan be traced by evolution down to what we call dead matter. We forget\r\nthat this “matter” is already high, since it potentially contains life,\r\nand even man, the crown of life. Many people imagine that the derivation\r\nof man from “dead matter” is equal to turning a king into a beggar. They\r\ndo not reflect that, on the other hand, a beggar is turned into a king.\r\nWhen I say that life arose one day out of the inorganic, or that a\r\ncrystal was turned into a cell, my statement really involves the\r\ncomplementary truth that the inorganic potentially contains life in\r\nitself. Otherwise we have the old miracle over again of something being\r\nproduced out of nothing, in spite of our spontaneous generation. Haeckel\r\nhas always been clear on this point. His later studies of the soul of\r\nthe atom and the plastidule only carry out the absolutely logical\r\ntreatment of the question that we find in these chapters of the first\r\nvolume of the _Morphology_.\r\n\r\nIncidentally the question is raised whether the plant or the animal was\r\nevolved first. Animal and plant are, of course, not rigidly distinct\r\nfrom each other. They are only the two great branches of the Darwinian\r\nevolution of living forms, and are united at the bottom, however much\r\nthey diverge above. Gegenbaur had represented this years before (1860)\r\nin a figure that Haeckel quotes in his _Monograph on the Radiolaria_ in\r\n1862. The whole kingdom of living things must be conceived “as a\r\nconnected series, within which we find two lines diverging from a common\r\ncentre and representing a gradual differentiation and development of\r\norganisation.” The terminal points of these lines (the highest plant and\r\nthe highest animal) are very different from each other, but the\r\ndifference gradually disappears as we go back towards the common centre,\r\nand the lowest stages in each kingdom can hardly be distinguished from\r\neach other. For these lowest stages Haeckel now carries out a plan that\r\nvery quickly forced itself on him.\r\n\r\nHe forms them into a new kingdom of life. To the animal and plant\r\nkingdoms he adds the primitive realm of the beings that showed\r\nunequivocal signs of the possession of life, yet were neither animals\r\nnor plants. He gives them the name of “Protists.” To botany and zoology\r\nis now added protistology.\r\n\r\nThe name “protists” (from _protiston_, the very first) is familiar to\r\nevery one in biology to-day. If protistology has not yet been securely\r\nestablished as a special branch of science, that is due to the\r\ncircumstance that a strict limit cannot be determined on either the\r\nplant or the animal side, so that the botanist encroaches on the\r\nprovince at one point and the zoologist at another. But when we remember\r\nthat Haeckel’s protists include the well-known bacilli, on which whole\r\nlibraries are accumulating to-day, it is clear that the province must be\r\ndefinitely marked off at some date in the near future, whether one\r\naccepts Darwinism or no.\r\n\r\nThese important innovations in technical biology show very clearly how\r\nsound and fruitful the new “natural philosophy” was. We have to go back\r\nto the untenable and utterly impracticable systems of Hegel, Schelling,\r\nand Steffen, which were immediately rejected as the trifling of\r\n_dilettanti_, or even to much that the admirable Oken did on the\r\nscientific side, if we would measure the whole distance between what\r\npeople understood in the sixties by “natural philosophy” and the real\r\nreformed philosophy that Haeckel gave to the world. This becomes clearer\r\nat every step we take in his work.\r\n\r\nThe first book has determined the method that leads to morphology, the\r\nscience of forms. The second has ranged the organic forms—protists,\r\nplants, and animals—over against the inorganic or “dead” forms, as far\r\nas this is possible from the new evolutionary point of view. We feel\r\nthat the third book will pass on to Darwin, and explain the world of\r\norganic forms by the Darwinian laws of evolution. Then the programme\r\nwould be carried out in its main features.\r\n\r\nBut Haeckel writes two whole books before he comes to this, and they\r\nare, perhaps, the most characteristic in the work. He only “adopted” the\r\ntheory of evolution in the sense that he applied it far more thoroughly\r\nthan Darwin to practical problems. In these two books he is entirely\r\nhimself. They are, at the same time, the most difficult in the work.\r\nEven to-day they place him on a lofty and lonely height apart from the\r\ngreat and strenuous controversy over Darwinism. I believe that the time\r\nwill yet come that will fully appreciate these books. Through them\r\nHaeckel will play a part in philosophy of which we have at present no\r\nprevision.\r\n\r\nThere is a word that is inseparable from the word “form”—individuality.\r\nMorphology, which does not analyse, but studies the form-unities as a\r\nwhole in the sense of Goethe’s definition, comes from the nature of\r\nthings to deal with the individual. In our artistic illustration the\r\nVenus of Milo, as a form-unity, is an æsthetic individuality. When its\r\nform is destroyed, its individuality perishes.\r\n\r\nLet us apply this to any one of the higher plants or animals. Take a\r\nturtle, for instance. A definite individual embodies the definite form\r\nto which I give the name. This form as such is entirely lost if I cut up\r\nthe turtle until it is unrecognisable. The limit of morphological study\r\nseems to be, just as in the case of the Venus of Milo, the integrity of\r\nthe individual turtle. Yet in the living turtle we find an enormous\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nIf I grind the Venus of Milo into dust, I am at once in a totally\r\ndifferent world with this dust. I am amongst the raw material of nature,\r\nuntouched by æsthetic influence. From this calcareous powder I can, in\r\nreality or imagination, pass on to the world of crystals, molecules, and\r\natoms. In that case I shall have done with æsthetic morphology. I come\r\nto the morphology of the inorganic, a very different branch. What do we\r\nfind in the case of the living turtle?\r\n\r\nIt is true that I can break up the turtle into simple chemical\r\nsubstances. In that case I make the same transition; I abandon organic\r\nmorphology, and pass, with the same _salto mortale_ as in the case of\r\nthe Venus of Milo, to the lower science of inorganic morphology.\r\n\r\nBut when I examine the structure of the living individual turtle before\r\nme I notice a special feature. Let us suppose that I break up the Venus\r\nof Milo only to a certain degree; or, with less vandalism, I do not\r\nbreak it up, but light up its inner structure to some extent by a sort\r\nof Röntgen-ray apparatus. And suppose I found that this one æsthetic\r\nindividuality is made up of millions of much smaller and æsthetically\r\nfiner and more unified images. I do not mean of millions of repetitions\r\nof the large Venus in miniature, but of real and unmistakable little\r\nworks of art, each of which, regarded separately and without any injury\r\nto its narrower individuality, might be just as excellent a subject for\r\næsthetic examination as the whole Venus.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, nonsense as regards the Venus of Milo. There is\r\nnothing of the kind in it. I have given the paradoxical supposition\r\nmerely for the purpose of showing what we really find in the case of the\r\nturtle.\r\n\r\nWhen the organic individual turtle is closely studied it breaks up first\r\ninto so many _simpler_ organic individuals, which undoubtedly belong as\r\nsuch to the province of organic morphology. They are the _cells_. The\r\ntheory of Schleiden, Schwann, and Virchow here comes into direct touch\r\nwith morphology. Every higher animal or plant has its own individuality;\r\nand within this individuality there is a conglomerate, a community, or a\r\nstate, of individuals of a lower order, that have their own life and\r\ntheir corresponding individual life-form. Man himself, the highest of\r\nanimals, is a cell-state. So Virchow taught. Each one of us is an\r\nindividual, and as such an object of morphology. The cell, each single\r\ncell in each of us, is also an individual, and as such is equally an\r\nobject of morphology. Hence it is the task of the morphology of\r\norganisms, not only to describe these higher individualities as such,\r\nbut also to look on them as glass-houses, as it were, with so many\r\nshelves, divisions, and smaller houses within of a lower rank. These\r\ninternal arrangements have to be described, piece by piece, with the\r\nsame fidelity.\r\n\r\nThis will probably suffice to convey a general idea of the subject.\r\nClearly, the great work that ought to form the general part of\r\nmorphology at this point was the precise determination of all these\r\nvarious layers of individuality that are found in the animals, plants,\r\nand protists, and, as we rise upward, enter into more and more complex\r\nrelations to each other.\r\n\r\nThe difference between, say, a turtle or a man and the cell which\r\ncombines in its millions to form them is not the only one. Between them\r\nwe seemed to find individualised, or almost individualised, links. Think\r\nof the idea of an organ. What is my heart? It is made of a number of\r\ncell-individuals, like my whole frame. But these cells form a sort of\r\nintermediate individuality in me. We may go further. What is a segment\r\nof a worm? What is an arm of a star-fish? They have so much independence\r\nthat they can continue to live, rapidly producing new cells and forming\r\na new worm or star-fish of the higher individual type, if they are cut\r\noff. The arrangement is still more difficult in the case of the plant.\r\nWhere in their case shall we find the stages of individuality that\r\ncorrespond to the animal-human? The cells are distinct in both cases.\r\nThe individual plant-cell corresponds to the individual animal-cell. But\r\nwhat is there in the plant that corresponds to _me_, as the animal-human\r\nmulticellular individual? Does the oak-tree, for instance? Certainly,\r\nthe oak is an individual. But it seems that it is the single sprout of\r\nit that corresponds to what I am. What is the relation of the tree to\r\nthis sprout?\r\n\r\nHere our ideas grow dim and confused. We human individuals unite to form\r\ncertain higher communities. The word “social” reminds us of the fact:\r\nthen we have the nation, the race, humanity. At least the earlier of\r\nthese stages certainly perform various combined functions, and are\r\nunderstood to form, or wish to form, new individuals. We speak of the\r\nsocial organism, the body of the people, the soul of the people, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nWe see that still more clearly in the case of the animals about us.\r\nIndividuals, that correspond to our conception of an individual man,\r\ncombine and form stocks and colonies, with division of labour. We find\r\nthis in the medusæ, corals, anemones, tunicates, and vermalians. One of\r\nthese animal stocks, to which our human social combinations only\r\ncorrespond in a much wider sense, gives us a stage that is represented\r\nby the tree in the plant-world. Infinite perspectives open out, and also\r\ninfinite complications. Infinite problems spring up for morphology to\r\ndeal with; it must make its way through the labyrinth of these\r\ncomplicated types of individualisation.\r\n\r\nThe matter is still more intricate if I begin at the bottom of the\r\nbiological series and proceed upwards. I, man, am an individual of a\r\ncertain stage in my own collective activity. It is true that I am made\r\nup of millions of cell-individuals, but when we look at the whole these\r\nare merely elementary units. But take a being from the protist-world\r\nthat is too lowly to be either animal or plant. In respect of its whole\r\nactivity it is an individual just as much as I am, and therefore in this\r\nregard at the same stage as I. At the same time it consists of a single\r\ncell. The distinction in me between unit and whole does not exist in it.\r\nIts unit is the whole. It would seem a Sisyphean task to reduce all this\r\nto a system.\r\n\r\nYet that is just what Haeckel has done.\r\n\r\nWith crystalline clearness he separates and reunites and arranges\r\neverything, from the primitive organic individual, that is not yet a\r\ntrue cell—the monera he had himself discovered—upward. Organic\r\nmorphology begins with them as its first object, the first complete\r\nindividuality, the first “form.” All that lies below it is beyond the\r\nprovince of morphology. The last conceivable organic individuality is,\r\nperhaps, the atom; and that is not the concern of morphology. We start\r\nfrom the organic. Above the pre-cellular individuals and the true cells\r\nthe next form-unities are the organs. Above the organs, after a few\r\nsubtle intermediate stages, are the “persons.” Thus a new word is given\r\nto what we have hitherto conventionally called an “individual,” when we\r\nwanted to denote a turtle, a bird, a man, or an higher animal as a\r\nwhole. To this corresponds in the plant the sprout. The stage above the\r\n“person” is the “stock.” We might also call it the social individual; in\r\nthe plant-world it is the tree, in the coral the coral-stock, in the\r\nhuman case the social combination of a number of men for common action.\r\n\r\nWe are reminded of Virchow’s speech, and how “consciousness” was dragged\r\ninto the debate on the cell-state. What psychological perspectives are\r\nopened out by this doctrine of individuality! Each form-unity, each\r\nsingle individuality in the series, with a soul! Souls combining for\r\ncommon action, and forming higher psychic unities! There is no detail in\r\nHaeckel’s whole life-work in which he speaks more boldly and freely and\r\nphilosophically than he does here. His lucid treatment raises to a\r\nhigher stage a philosophic question that has occupied thinkers for ages.\r\n\r\nThat is the third book. The fourth takes up a different subject. Let us\r\nadopt in organic morphology this wonderful theory of individuality, the\r\ntheory of stages within the form. Then let us turn to consider\r\nimpartially the vast multitude of living forms. How can we now arrange\r\nthis infinite confusion by merely looking at it? Artificial\r\nclassification has attempted it a hundred times, and always without\r\nsuccess. On this side there is only one way to proceed—the mathematical.\r\n\r\nI study them with strictly mathematical figures. I determine their axes,\r\nand the mathematical aspects of their forms. Possibly that will give a\r\npractical result; the only kind of artificial system that can be\r\naccommodated with the Darwinian theory, and perhaps render it assistance\r\nby the sharpness of its lines. Does it answer? Take a crystal, a\r\nspecimen from inorganic morphology. The description of it is susceptible\r\nof a strictly mathematical form. Now take a star-fish, a worm, a human\r\nbeing. We find that even these organic structures have a mysterious\r\nrelation at bottom to certain mathematical, stereometric forms. We might\r\nalmost say, to certain forms of human thought. Everything in the organic\r\nworld is in a state of flux. But through the whole moving stream we can\r\ntrace the outline of one stable element, something like a mathematical\r\nidea. A sort of Platonism of the living forms vaguely takes shape.\r\n\r\nHaeckel speaks of lines, axes, circles, radii, and all kinds of rhythmic\r\nstructures. It does seem that the countless individual forms of living\r\nthings fit into a scheme of a limited number of mathematical forms.\r\nStrictly speaking this is not a real morphology of living things. We\r\nonly find these clear and rigid forms schematically in the wild\r\nprofusion of forms of the protists, plants, and animals. They are only a\r\nreminiscence of the laws of the purely inorganic, which the eye of the\r\nobserver just detects as the lowest stratum. Hence Haeckel calls this\r\nsection the “promorphology” of organisms.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this section, which essays to compress all living things\r\ninto a very simple scheme, is the hardest to read in the whole work. A\r\nnumber of strange and difficult words have to be invented for this\r\nstereometric scheme to which he would reduce the animal and plant forms.\r\nHaeckel himself declared, twenty years afterwards (in the second part of\r\nthe _Monograph on the Radiolaria_), that this stereometry of organic\r\nforms had found little favour in biology “especially on account of the\r\ndifficult and complicated nomenclature.” But he had complete confidence\r\nas to the substance of it, even after so great a lapse of time.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact we have here, it seems to me, a gigantic preparatory\r\nwork, not so much for the strict purpose of classification, as for a\r\nreal philosophy of botany and zoology that will be founded some day.\r\nThis recurrence of sharp stereometric structures, not only in the\r\ncrystal, but also, if less clearly, in the biological world, will one\r\nday prove an important source of knowledge, in a sense that is not even\r\nclear in Haeckel himself.\r\n\r\nWe are already entering upon a period that has a glimpse of the truth\r\nthat the deepest power of Beethoven’s music, or Goethe’s poetry, or\r\nRaphael’s painting, or Michael Angelo’s sculpture is a mysterious\r\nrevelation of the most subtle mathematical relations and\r\neffects—produced without conscious perception of these relations, though\r\na human mind is at work in them. In spite of all our “consciousness,”\r\nthe obscure intuitive power at work in these human artistic achievements\r\ndiffers very little from the curious force with which a radiolarian\r\nbuilds up its little house in the deep-sea or a caseworm fits on its\r\nfine, rhythmic, snail-like coat. In both we have the same profound,\r\ncrystal-like constructive power that brought forth the wings of the\r\nbutterfly, the feathers of the bird, the bodily frame of all the animals\r\nand plants, that harmonises so well with strict mathematical forms. In\r\nBeethoven and Raphael it is not more conscious or unconscious, not\r\nclearer or vaguer, not more mystical or more natural, than in the\r\npoorest worm or the microscopically small radiolarian. The æsthetics of\r\nthe twentieth century will take up these ideas.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HAECKEL’S VILLA AT JENA.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is a great work. How few there are in the whole of the nineteenth\r\ncentury that show the wealth of ideas we find in the first volume\r\nalone.[4] And this is only one volume. We have as yet said nothing of\r\nthe idea that is of the greatest consequence in connection with\r\nHaeckel’s own development. He was a Darwinian from 1862 onwards. After\r\n1866 and the publication of the _General Morphology_ we find him\r\ndominated in all his work by one single idea from the Darwinian group.\r\nHe brought this idea so effectively to the front, improved and developed\r\nit so assiduously, and applied it in so many ways, that it has come to\r\nbe regarded as his own most characteristic work. It is inseparable from\r\nhis name. Whatever the future may be, wherever Haeckel’s name is uttered\r\npeople will add the phrase that was made peculiarly his after 1866, that\r\ncolours and pervades all his works—technical, popular, polemical, or\r\nphilosophical—as much as the word “Monism.” It is the phrase: the\r\nbiogenetic law.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  The reader may be interested to know that Haeckel gives a popular\r\n  summary of his early work on individuality and on the mathematical\r\n  types of organisms in a more recent work. This has been translated\r\n  into English with the title _The Wonders of Life_. The two chapters\r\n  that deal with these questions are omitted from the abridged cheap\r\n  edition. [Trans.]\r\n\r\nHere and there even in the first volume of the _Morphology_ a note is\r\nstruck that the reader cannot clearly understand. It increases in the\r\nsecond volume until it dominates the whole book.\r\n\r\nThe phrase is known far and wide to-day. This is partly due to Haeckel’s\r\nown insistence on it, but perhaps still more to the real value of the\r\nidea itself. It crops up in a hundred different fields—psychology,\r\nethics, philosophy, even in art and æsthetics. I have been able to trace\r\nit even into modern mysticism. For the moment I will only point out that\r\nit has been attacked and misstated with real fanaticism, in spite of the\r\nsplendid and perfectly clear account of it that Haeckel has given.\r\n\r\nThe proper place to read of it is, as I said, the second volume of the\r\n_Morphology_. This volume has to give an account of the evolution of\r\norganic forms. What is given rather casually, almost Socratically, in\r\nDarwin is now developed into a number of strict laws. This method of\r\nexpounding more or less hypothetical, new, and insecure ideas in the\r\nform of laws has since been frequently attacked. Some have been led by\r\nit to take the ideas as so many dogmas, and even to learn the laws by\r\nheart as if they were texts in Scripture. Others have then laid the\r\nblame of this dogmatic interpretation on Haeckel himself. It is quite\r\ntrue that there was the possibility of a misunderstanding. People do not\r\nalways think for themselves, and the statement of a proposition in the\r\nform of a law may prove a pitfall for them. The blind learning of them\r\nby heart is always mischievous. On the other hand, it might be urged\r\nthat the statement of the ideas in this bald way affords the best\r\nopportunity for a thorough and rational criticism of them, precisely\r\nbecause they give such pregnant expression to the writer’s meaning. I do\r\nnot find that order and strict logical definitions have ever done any\r\nharm of themselves, whatever it is that is put in order and defined. On\r\nthe contrary. People must confuse order sometimes with real dogmatism.\r\nOf this there is not a word in the whole book, while at an important\r\njuncture the reader is actually warned to be on his guard against undue\r\npressure. “In this,” we read in the twentieth chapter, “we do not wish\r\nto draw up a body of laws of organic morphology, but to give hints and\r\nsuggestions for drawing them up. A science that is yet only in its\r\ncradle, like the morphology of organisms, will have many important\r\nchanges to undergo before it can venture to claim for its general\r\npropositions the rank of absolute and unexceptionable natural laws.”\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, it was in this provisional definition of laws that\r\nthe famous biogenetic law first took shape, and with it a spirit entered\r\ninto Darwinism in the narrower sense that was never again detached from\r\nits master, Haeckel.\r\n\r\nLet us once more take a simple illustration from facts. Take a green\r\naquatic frog and a fish, say a pike.\r\n\r\nBoth of them have a solid vertebral column in their frames, and\r\ntherefore both must be classed amongst the vertebrates. But within the\r\nlimits of this group they differ very considerably from each other. The\r\nfrog has four well-developed legs, its body terminates in a tail, and it\r\nbreathes by means of lungs, like a bird, a dog, or a human being. The\r\nfish has fins, it swims in the water by means of these fins and its long\r\nrudder-like tail, and it breathes the air contained in the water by\r\nmeans of gills. When we arrange the vertebrates in a series, with man at\r\ntheir head, it is perfectly clear that the frog stands higher than the\r\nfish in regard to its whole structure. It is lower than the lizard, the\r\nbird, or the mammal, but at the same time it is a little nearer to these\r\nthree than the fish is. That was recognised long ago by Linné, who\r\nassigned them a corresponding rank. The fishes are the lowest group of\r\nthe vertebrates; the frogs belong to the group immediately above them.\r\nNow let us see how one of these frogs is developed to-day. The frogs are\r\noviparous (egg-laying) animals. The mother frog lays her eggs in the\r\nwater, and in the ordinary course of nature a new little frog develops\r\nfrom each of these eggs. But the object that develops from them is\r\naltogether different from the adult frog.\r\n\r\nThis object is the familiar tadpole. At first it has no legs, but it has\r\na long oar-like tail, with which it can make its way briskly in the\r\nwater. It breathes in the water by means of gills just like a fish. It\r\nis only when the tadpole grows four legs, loses its tail, closes up the\r\ngills at its throat, and begins to breathe by the mouth and lungs\r\ninstead, that it becomes a real frog. There can be no doubt whatever\r\nthat the tadpole is very much more like the fish in all the most\r\nimportant particulars than the frog. Between the frog-egg and the frog\r\nitself we have a stage of development in each individual case of which\r\nwe might almost say that the young frog has first to turn into a fish\r\nbefore it can become a frog.\r\n\r\nHow are we to explain this?\r\n\r\nAt first people supposed something like the following: All beings in\r\nnature are admirably adapted to their environment and their\r\nlife-conditions. Whatever be the explanation of it, it is a simple fact.\r\nNow, the frog lays its eggs in the water. The young ones develop from\r\nthese eggs, and find themselves in the water. The most practical\r\nadaptation for them is to swim about by means of a tail and breathe by\r\nmeans of gills like the fish. They do not reach land until later, and\r\nthey creep on to it and have an equipment of the opposite character,\r\nwith legs and lungs.\r\n\r\nBut this explanation throws no light on the question why the frog lays\r\nits eggs in the water. However, there might be some utility or other,\r\nsome need for protection, for instance, in that. Let us take a few other\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThere are several species of tree-frogs, and toads, and closely related\r\namphibia like the salamanders, that do not lay their eggs in the water.\r\nSome of them bury them in folds of their own external skin, others (such\r\nas the Alpine salamander) retain them within the mother’s body, as the\r\nmammals do. The young animals develop there from the eggs. Even there,\r\nhowever, where there is no question of aquatic life, the young frogs,\r\ntoads, and salamanders first assume the fish-form. The young frogs and\r\ntoads have fin-like tails, and all of them have gills. There seems to be\r\nsome _internal_ law of development that forces the frog and its\r\nrelatives to pass through the fish-stage in their individual evolution\r\neven when there is no trace whatever of any external utility.\r\n\r\nNow let us examine the matter as Darwinians and believers in evolution.\r\n\r\nThere are reasons on every hand for believing that the frogs and\r\nsalamanders, which now stand higher in classification than the fishes,\r\nwere developed from the fishes in earlier ages in the course of\r\nprogressive evolution. Once upon a time they were fishes. If that is so,\r\nthe curious phenomenon we have been considering really means that each\r\nyoung frog resembles its _fish-ancestors_. In each case to-day the\r\nfrog’s egg first produces the earlier or ancestral stage, the fish. It\r\nthen develops rapidly into a frog. In other words, the individual\r\ndevelopment recapitulates an important chapter of the earlier history of\r\nthe whole race of frogs. Putting this in the form of a law, it runs:\r\neach new individual must, in its development, pass rapidly through the\r\nform of its parents’ ancestors before it assumes the parent form itself.\r\nIf a new individual frog is to be developed, and if the ancestors of the\r\nwhole frog-stem were fishes, the first thing to develop from the frog’s\r\negg will be a fish, and it will only later assume the form of a frog.\r\n\r\nThat is a simple and pictorial outline of what we mean when we speak of\r\n“the biogenetic law.” We need, of course, much more than the one\r\nfrog-fish fact before we can erect it into a law. But we have only to\r\nlook round us, and we find similar phenomena as common as pebbles.\r\n\r\nLet us bear in mind that evolution proceeded from certain amphibia to\r\nthe lizards, and from these to the birds and mammals. That is a long\r\njourney, but we have no alternative. If the amphibia (such as the frog\r\nand the salamander) descend from the fishes, all the higher classes up\r\nto man himself must also have done so. Hence the law must have\r\ntransmitted even to ourselves this ancestral form of the gill-breathing\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nWhat a mad idea, many will say; that man should at one time be a tadpole\r\nlike the frog! And yet—there’s no help in prayer, as Falstaff said—even\r\nthe human germ or embryo passes through a stage in the womb at which it\r\nshows the outline of gills on the throat just like a fish. It is the\r\nsame with the dog, the horse, the kangaroo, the duck-mole, the bird, the\r\ncrocodile, the turtle, the lizard; they all have the same structure. Nor\r\nis this an isolated fact. From the fish was evolved the amphibian; from\r\nthis came the lizard; from the lizard, on Darwinian principles, the\r\nbird. The lizard has solid teeth in its mouth; the bird has no teeth in\r\nits beak. That is to say, it has none _to-day_; but it had when it was a\r\nlizard. Here, then, we have an intermediate stage between the fish and\r\nthe bird. We must expect that the bird-embryo in the egg will show some\r\ntrace of it. As a matter of fact it does so. When we examine young\r\nparrots in the egg we find that they have teeth in their mouths before\r\nthe bill is formed. When the fact was first discovered, the real\r\nintermediate form between the lizard and the bird was not known. It was\r\nafterwards discovered at Solenhofen in a fossil impression from the\r\nJurassic period. This was the archeopteryx, which had feathers like a\r\nreal bird, and yet had teeth in its mouth like the lizard when it lived\r\non earth. The instance is instructive in two ways. In the first place it\r\nshows that we were quite justified in drawing our conclusions as to the\r\npast from the bird’s embryonic form, even if the true transitional form\r\nbetween the lizard and the bird were never discovered at all. In the\r\nsecond place, we see in the young bird in the egg the reproduction of\r\ntwo consecutive ancestral stages: one in the fish-gills, the other in\r\nthe lizard-like teeth. Once the law is admitted, there can be nothing\r\nstrange in this. If _one_ ancestral stage, that of the fish, is\r\nreproduced in the young animal belonging to a higher group, why not\r\nseveral?—why not all of them? No doubt the ancestral series of the\r\nhigher forms is of enormous length. What an immense number of stages\r\nthere must have been before the fish! And then we have still the\r\namphibian, the lizard, and the bird or mammal, up to man.\r\n\r\nWhy should not the law run: the whole ancestral series must be\r\nreproduced in the development of each individual organism? We are now in\r\na position to see the whole bearing of Haeckel’s idea, and at the same\r\ntime to appreciate his careful restrictions of it.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us see a little of the history of the matter. In the first\r\nthird of the nineteenth century a number of pre-Darwinian ideas of\r\nevolution flitted about like ghosts in natural philosophy, as I have\r\nalready said. The evolutionary ideas of Goethe and Lamarck are well\r\nknown to-day. Another thinker of great influence was Lorentz Oken, who\r\nestablished the custom of holding scientific congresses. Oken had been\r\nconstantly occupied with embryology, the science of the development of\r\nthe individual organism. He was at all events acquainted with all that\r\nwas known at the time on the subject. I open an old volume, wretchedly\r\nprinted on blotting-paper, of Oken’s _General Natural History for all\r\nReaders_ (1833), and turn to a passage in the fourth volume (the first\r\nto be issued) on page 470.\r\n\r\nWe read that the caterpillar of the butterfly resembles the animal form\r\nat a stage of development that lies below the insect—the worm. Oken\r\nsays: “There is no doubt that we have here a striking resemblance, and\r\none that justifies us in thinking that the development in the ovum is\r\nmerely a repetition of the story of the creation of the animal groups.”\r\nOken was quite aware that the chick in the egg had gill-slits like the\r\nfish. He bases his idea on that fact. He was very close indeed to the\r\ntheory that Haeckel has so wonderfully elaborated. However, he was\r\ngreeted with laughter. His theory was treated as an absurdity from 1833\r\nto 1866. It cannot be denied that he was himself partly to blame for\r\nthis. Oken made two serious mistakes. On both points Haeckel is\r\nperfectly clear and sound. Moreover, the theory of natural evolution\r\nthat made it possible for us to speak of “ancestors” was still a\r\nCinderella in the days of Oken. No sooner was it rehabilitated than the\r\nprinciple of the old theory of embryonic forms returned once more.\r\n\r\nDarwin himself at once appealed to it, but it was reserved for Haeckel\r\nto develop its full importance. He corrected it in two particulars. Oken\r\nand his admirers had made an unfortunate mistake. They believed in a\r\ngenealogical tree of all living things, but they conceived it on the\r\nlines of the old classification. Linné had enumerated in succession:\r\nmammals, birds, amphibia, fishes, insects, and worms. He put them in one\r\nstraight line, which is certainly the best arrangement for general\r\npurposes. But when Oken came with the idea of natural evolution, he at\r\nonce took this series as the outline of a genealogical tree. The mammals\r\ndescended from the birds; the fishes from the insects; and so on. If\r\nthat were really the case, the highest animals would be expected to\r\nreproduce all the animal and plant stages in the course of their\r\nembryonic development, on the lines of the theory. The human being would\r\nhave to be, successively, not only a lizard and a fish, but even a bird,\r\na beetle, a crab, and so on. This was by no means borne out by the\r\nfacts, and so the theory seemed to be discredited.\r\n\r\nNow let us glance at Haeckel’s genealogical tables. We find eight of\r\nthem, artistically drawn, at the end of the second volume. The\r\n“genealogical tree” is given in the form of a branching tree, or as a\r\nhuge forest-like growth of stems some of which only meet in the ultimate\r\nroots. There is no trace in Haeckel’s designs of the sort of\r\nEiffel-Tower arrangement that the Linnean system involved. At the bottom\r\nwe find the protists, the most primitive forms of life. From this point\r\ntwo parallel stems diverge, that of the animals and that of the plants;\r\nthey never touch each other after this point, and so cannot be expected\r\nto be reproduced in the embryonic forms. Then the animal stem is split\r\nup almost at the root into at least five independent branches, each of\r\nwhich pursues its separate line of development. One culminates in the\r\ninsects, above the worms and the crustacea. A totally independent stem\r\nissues in the vertebrates, and this in turn breaks into many different\r\nbranches. Beyond the lizards, for instance, we find the development of\r\nthe mammals and birds, which run on as separate and parallel lines. It\r\nwas mere nonsense to expect a mammal in its embryonic development to\r\nassume the form of a bird, or a crab, or a beetle, or a mussel, or a\r\nmedusa, even if the biogenetic law were established ten times over.\r\n\r\nThe second mistake made by Oken was to declare that, whatever it cost,\r\nthe law must be observed everywhere. He examined the butterfly. It\r\npassed through two curious embryonic stages: first the caterpillar, then\r\nthe pupa. The caterpillar corresponded to the worm; that might be\r\nplausibly contended. But the pupa also must stand for something. Between\r\nthe worm and the insect in classification was the crustacean. It had a\r\nhard shell: so had the pupa. Consequently, the pupa is a reproduction of\r\nthe crustacea-stage. Such were the bold chess-moves of the older\r\ntheorist.\r\n\r\nHaeckel first established that there was such a thing as the biogenetic\r\nlaw. There is a fundamental norm, which is made clear to us in\r\nembryology and can at the same time (remember the instance of the\r\nlizard-like teeth in the bird-embryo) give us most wonderful suggestions\r\nas to the line of ancestral development. But it has certain limitations,\r\nas we will now show.\r\n\r\nThe adaptations in the sense of the Darwinian laws have affected the\r\nanimal’s embryonic life more and more, the higher the tree of life grew.\r\nThe long recapitulation of the ancestral stages often came into conflict\r\nwith the young individual’s need for protection. The result was that the\r\nbiogenetic law found itself restricted by the Darwinian laws of\r\nadaptation. The too lengthy succession of ancestral portraits was\r\nabbreviated and compressed. Whole stages of embryonic or larval\r\ndevelopment were interpolated that had nothing to do with these\r\nancestral portraits, but were destined for the protection of the fœtus.\r\nThe butterfly-pupa is really an instructive instance of this\r\ndescription. It does not reproduce a crab-stage, nor has there been any\r\nstage in the ancestry of the butterfly when they lived throughout life\r\nin pupa-houses. The pupa is simply a later adaptation in the development\r\nof the butterfly, a protective stage in which it accomplishes the\r\ntransition from the caterpillar-form in much the same way as the young\r\nbird develops under the protection of the hard egg-shell. Thus only a\r\nfaint and shadowy trace has been left of the real ancestral forms,\r\nthough this trace is an extremely instructive one. But we must not\r\nexpect the impossible from it. In this way our naked and crude\r\nbiogenetic law assumes a more finished and scientific form: the\r\nembryonic development of the individual is a condensed, abbreviated, and\r\nto some extent modified epitome of the evolutionary history of its\r\nancestors. That is more modest, but it is a correct expression of the\r\nfacts. The essential point of the older idea was not in itself wrong;\r\nall that was done was to explain the gaps, and leaps, and contradictions\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nNow that Oken’s share in the theory has been properly appreciated, we\r\nmay notice another little historical detail. In the period immediately\r\nafter his time these ideas were ridiculed by men of science, great and\r\nsmall, but they were not exactly “done to death.” Agassiz, the most\r\npronounced creationist and dualist of all the nineteenth-century\r\nzoologists, expounded them occasionally as a curious instance of the\r\ndivine action. In fact, he looked upon the whole of zoology as a mystic\r\ncabinet of curiosities—the more curious the better. Thus he came to play\r\nwith this idea and confirm it, but merely took it at first as a fine\r\nfigure of speech. Agassiz is a tragical form. He survived Darwin, much\r\nin the same way that many an elegant _mot-de-salon_ on the rights of man\r\nsurvived the French Revolution. Suddenly the whole structure of his\r\nideas seemed to fall about him. Where he had played with roses, he now\r\nfound torches. He reeled like a smitten man, and cried out against the\r\nhorrid monsters that brought him pain and bitterness. His anxiety began\r\nwith Darwin, even as regarded the question of the embryo. But there was\r\nanother, a man far away in South America, that increased it—Fritz\r\nMüller.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1822, one of the finest pioneers in zoological work, Fritz\r\nMüller had wished to become a higher teacher, but had abandoned his plan\r\non account of the oath that had to be taken by every servant of the\r\nState. In 1849 he wrote to the Ministry requesting that he might be\r\nallowed to dispense with the formula “So help me God, through Jesus\r\nChrist.” Meeting with a refusal, he went to South America, and began a\r\nsolitary life as a student in the primitive forest, and sought to\r\naccumulate valuable zoological material. Darwin called him “the king of\r\nobservers.” In 1864 he published an essay of ninety-four pages with the\r\ntitle _For Darwin_. He revived and improved the old idea of Oken’s and\r\nmade fresh contributions to the natural history of the crustacea that\r\nwere literally stupefying. We may say that the point that he believed he\r\nhad established, in virtue of the law, in regard to the genealogical\r\ntree of the crustacea, was afterwards, with apparent justice, called\r\ninto question, even by supporters of the law such as Arnold Lang. That,\r\nhowever, did not diminish the extent of his influence at the time.\r\nHaeckel has generously acknowledged how strongly he felt that influence\r\nhimself. Nevertheless all that has been said about Haeckel’s priority in\r\nfully applying and shaping the law, and in its final formulation, is\r\nperfectly correct.\r\n\r\nWhen Haeckel had massed his material he had first to create the\r\nnecessary terms for arranging it distinctly. In the language of the old\r\nlegend, he called the day day, and the night. To the story of ancestral\r\ndevelopment, or the evolution of the stem, he gave the name of\r\n_phylogeny_, or stem-history (_phylon_ = stem). The word circulates very\r\nwidely to-day. The story of the development of the individual until it\r\nreaches maturity was then called _ontogeny_ (_on_ = being), which\r\ncoincides generally with embryology (though it may also include the\r\ngrowth of the child). The law then ran: Ontogeny is an abbreviated and\r\nfrequently disarranged epitome of phylogeny. Special attention was drawn\r\nto the qualifications “abbreviated” and “disarranged.”\r\n\r\nHere again two fresh names were invented. In so far as the embryonic\r\ndevelopment is a true recapitulation of the stem-history, it is called\r\n_palingenesis_, or repetition of the ancestral traits. When the\r\ndevelopment is altered by new adaptations it is called _cenogenesis_,\r\n“foreign” or “disturbing” development.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected by small-minded critics that Haeckel forces nature\r\nto mar its own work. The real meaning is quite clear if we bear in mind\r\nthe blunder of Oken. In this case “disturbed development” is merely an\r\nexpression of the fact that the laws we invent are ideal forms, and not\r\nalways convenient realities. We learn by heart that the earth is a\r\nglobe, and its orbit is an ellipse. Neither of the two propositions is\r\nstrictly accurate; no mathematical figure even has objective reality. By\r\nthe sheer attraction of the water of the ocean to the continents the\r\nearth has an irregularity of shape that it is barely possible to express\r\nin words. To call the path of the earth round the sun, constantly\r\naltering as it does, and still further complicated by the sun’s own\r\nmovement, a real ellipse is the greatest nonsense conceivable.\r\n\r\nIn this sense every natural law is subject to disturbances, though these\r\nin turn are the outcome of natural laws. If we do not cavil over the\r\nname, we find that the idea it stands for is of the greatest consequence\r\nfor any further use of the biogenetic law. Unless it is borne in mind,\r\nthe law, especially in the hands of the inexpert, falls into hopeless\r\nconfusion. We read so often that the ancestral history is identical with\r\nthe embryonic development. The one is a recapitulation of the other.\r\nThis supposed law is then applied in psychology, æsthetics, and many\r\nother directions. If it succeeds, there is jubilation. If it does not\r\nsucceed (as it does not in a thousand cases), the whole blame is thrown\r\non Haeckel. People discover that “the biogenetic law breaks down here,”\r\nand they throw over Darwinism altogether.\r\n\r\nThe second volume of the _Morphology_ is the standing palladium against\r\nall this nonsense. It marks off the real readers and followers of\r\nHaeckel from the superficial talkers who run after him because he is\r\nfamous, and will leave him unscrupulously for any other celebrity of the\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe book must be read. Even in this second volume an incredible amount\r\nof matter is compressed. An introduction, consisting of a hundred and\r\nsixty pages of small type, gives us an idea of the new system. This is\r\nthe first scheme of a real “natural classification” of living things.\r\nFrom this we pass to special morphology. But this fearless sketch of the\r\nspecialised genealogical tree, according to the new ideas, puts general\r\nmorphology in its true light. We are made to feel that it is not all\r\nmere theory. To-morrow—nay, to-day—the whole practice of zoology and\r\nbotany will have to be remodelled on the new principles. Off with the\r\nroof of the ark! The whole museum must be cleared out. We want new\r\ndivisions, new labels. The old controversy between the Nominalists and\r\nthe Realists seemed to have come to life once more. How students had\r\nplayed with the word “affinity” as a symbol. The lemurs were “related”\r\nto the apes, and to other groups of mammals. The star-fishes were\r\nrelated to the sea-urchins, to the encrinites. The word had, in fact,\r\nled to a certain amount of arrangement; the stuffed or dried or\r\npreserved specimens in the museum were placed side by side. Suddenly the\r\nwhole thing became a reality. The things that were “related” to each\r\nother had really been connected historically in earlier ages. The lemurs\r\nwere the progenitors of the apes. Behind them were a series of other\r\nmammals. Star-fishes, sea-urchins, and encrinites, formed a definite\r\nbranch of the great tree, and were historically connected; not\r\nsymbolically, but in a real extinct common ancestor.\r\n\r\nIt was a vast work. A single man had at first the whole kingdom in his\r\nhands, had to reject the old lines of demarcation and create new ones.\r\nThere was a certain advantage at the time. Since Cuvier’s time an\r\nimmense quantity of new discoveries had accumulated for the construction\r\nof a system of living things. Müller, Siebold, Leuckart, Vogt, and many\r\nothers, had done a great deal of preparatory work. All this was of great\r\nassistance to the man who now came forward with courage and a talent for\r\norganisation. Nevertheless it needed real genius, together with almost\r\nboundless knowledge, to accomplish the task. We must remember how\r\nreactionary (even apart from the question of evolution) was the\r\nsystematic work of distinguished and assuredly learned zoologists like\r\nGiebel at that time; they worked on in a humdrum way as if the more\r\nadvanced students did not exist. How different it has all become since\r\nHaeckel’s thorough reform of classification! We are astounded to-day at\r\nthe skill with which he drew lines in his very first sketch that were so\r\nnear to the permanent truth. I need only point to the new scheme of the\r\nclassification of the vertebrates. A good deal of his work was, of\r\ncourse, bound to be defective, because the facts were not yet known; for\r\ninstance, in fixing the point at which the vertebrates may have evolved\r\nfrom the invertebrates. It was not until a year later that the discovery\r\nof the embryonic development of the ascidia by Kowalewsky threw light on\r\nthis. Again, there was the solution of the problem of the ultimate\r\nroot-connection of the great parallel animal stems. In this matter\r\nHaeckel himself brought illumination by his gastræa-theory.\r\n\r\nOn the whole this systematic introduction to the second volume would\r\nhave sufficed of itself to secure for Haeckel a prominent position in\r\nthe history of zoology and botany. He himself was chiefly proud of the\r\nfact that it was the first natural-philosophical system on the new lines\r\nto meet the rigorous demands of academic science, and indeed to\r\nrevolutionise academic science. This enhances his complete triumph in\r\nthe last two books of the volume. First man is introduced, with absolute\r\nclearness and decisiveness, into the system of evolved natural beings,\r\nas crown of the animal world, but subject to the same laws as the\r\nanimal: a vertebrate, a mammal, whose nearest relatives are the\r\nanthropoid apes. Thus at last the “system of nature” was complete. It\r\nembodied the unity of nature. It formed the framework of facts for a\r\nunified natural philosophy, Monism. The _monon_, the “one,” embracing\r\nall things, that included nature in itself and itself in nature, became\r\nthe last scientific definition of what people called “God.”\r\n\r\nThus the volume, which had begun the system of nature with the monera,\r\ncloses with a chapter on the Monistic God—“the God in nature.” The\r\nconception of God in human fashion is rejected. Man is merely a\r\nvertebrate, a mammal, adapted in his whole structure to our little\r\nplanet. A supreme Being to whom we ascribe omnipresence could not\r\npossibly be confined within the narrow limits of this vertebrate and\r\nmammal organisation. When we try to do so we fall into unshapely\r\nconceptions that are wholly unworthy of the most exalted of all words,\r\nideas, and beings. It is in this connection that Haeckel uses for the\r\nfirst time the phrase “gaseous vertebrate,” that has so often been\r\nquoted and attacked since. He means to say that we are driven to such\r\ndebasing and senseless definitions if we do not recognise in God the\r\nessence of the whole system of things; if we form our idea of him\r\narbitrarily on any particular property of things within the system. We\r\nmust beware—as he expressly says—of such confused and unworthy\r\ncomparisons.\r\n\r\n“Our philosophy,” Haeckel continues, “knows only one God, and this\r\nAlmighty God dominates the whole of nature without exception. We see his\r\nactivity in all phenomena without exception. The whole of the inorganic\r\nworld is subject to him just as much as the organic. If a body falls\r\nfifteen feet in the first second in empty space, if three atoms of\r\noxygen unite with one atom of sulphur to form sulphuric acid, if the\r\nangle that is formed by the contiguous surfaces of a column of\r\nrock-crystal is always 120 degrees, these phenomena are just as truly\r\nthe direct action of God as the flowering of the plant, the movement of\r\nthe animal, or the thought of man. We all exist ‘by the grace of God,’\r\nthe stone as well as the water, the radiolarian as well as the pine, the\r\ngorilla as well as the Emperor of China. No other conception of God\r\nexcept this that sees his spirit and force in all natural phenomena is\r\nworthy of his all-enfolding greatness; only when we trace all forces and\r\nall movements, all the forms and properties of matter, to God, as the\r\nsustainer of all things, do we reach the human idea and reverence for\r\nhim that really corresponds to his infinite greatness. In him we live,\r\nand move, and have our being. Thus does natural philosophy become a\r\ntheology. The cult of nature passes into that service of God of which\r\nGoethe says: ‘Assuredly there is no nobler reverence for God than that\r\nsprings up in our heart from conversation with nature.’ God is almighty:\r\nhe is the sole sustainer and cause of all things. In other words, God is\r\nthe universal law of causality. God is absolutely perfect; he cannot act\r\nin any other than a perfectly good manner; he cannot therefore act\r\narbitrarily or freely—God is necessity. God is the sum of all force, and\r\ntherefore of all matter. Every conception of God that separates him from\r\nmatter, and opposes to him a sum of forces that are not of a divine\r\nnature, leads to amphitheism (or ditheism) and on to polytheism. In\r\nshowing the unity of the whole of nature, Monism points out that only\r\none God exists, and that this God reveals himself in all the phenomena\r\nof nature. In grounding all the phenomena of organic or inorganic nature\r\non the universal law of causality, and exhibiting them as the outcome of\r\n‘efficient causes,’ Monism proves that God is the necessary cause of all\r\nthings and the law itself. In recognising none but divine forces in\r\nnature, in proclaiming all natural laws to be divine, Monism rises to\r\nthe greatest and most lofty conception of which man, the most perfect of\r\nall things, is capable, the conception of the unity of God and nature.”\r\n\r\nThe book closes with these words and a quotation from Goethe. It had\r\nopened with a quotation from Goethe. Goethe runs through the whole of\r\nthe two energetic volumes like an old and venerable anthem. The stalwart\r\nfighter not only traces his whole Monistic philosophy to Goethe: not\r\nonly owes to him the very idea of morphology. In front of the second and\r\nmore strictly Darwinistic volume he has a dedication “to the founders of\r\nthe theory of evolution,” and between Darwin and Lamarck we find the\r\nname of Goethe. It was Haeckel’s firm conviction that Goethe not only\r\nbelieved in the unity of God and nature, but literally in the natural\r\nevolution of the various species of animals and plants from each other.\r\nIn this conviction, which claims Goethe explicitly for Darwin, he has\r\nnever been shaken, although his own friends and convinced evolutionists\r\n(Oscar Schmidt, for instance) have often opposed him on the point.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written since the days of the _General Morphology_ both\r\nfor and against this Goethe-Darwin theory, but I cannot see that we have\r\ngot much further with it. I still find that a candid study of some of\r\nGoethe’s smaller writings, such as the _History of my Botanical_\r\n_Studies_, the criticism of D’Alton’s _Sloths and Pachyderms_ (which is\r\nvery important), and several others, compels us to think that Goethe\r\nreally believed, in a strikingly Darwinian way, in a slow transformation\r\nand evolution of animal and plant species in virtue of purely natural\r\nlaws; and that he always laid great stress on this idea of his as an\r\noriginal notion, far in advance of the professional science of his time.\r\nWe not only have several clear passages, but the whole point of his\r\nargument really rests on this idea. Hence, apart altogether from the\r\npedantry that tries to make a cabalistic mystery out of Goethe’s works,\r\nand always reads B for A and C for B, it does seem that there was truth\r\nin Haeckel’s first view of the matter, in spite of all the ink that has\r\nbeen shed over it and the vast amount of word-splitting exegesis.\r\nDarwinism has, in a certain sense, its German side, even apart from all\r\nthat Haeckel has done for it.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis was the book, then, that the deeply afflicted author wrung from\r\nhimself as his “testament.” It was written and printed with\r\nunprecedented speed. When the first copies were issued, the author had a\r\nfeeling that he had nearly “done for himself.” He could not sleep. The\r\nstate of his nerves gave great concern to his friends, who were watching\r\nhim most anxiously. With a stolid fatalism, as if nothing mattered now,\r\nhe yielded to their pressing advice, and decided to travel for a time.\r\nFar away on the blue Atlantic, at the gate to all the glories of the\r\ntropics, there is an island, Teneriffe, that was counted one of “the\r\nisles of the blest” in the old Roman days. A huge volcano rises from it,\r\nand on its flanks we find all the zones of the geography of plants, as\r\nin a model collection. Humboldt has given us a splendid description of\r\nit, as the first station of his voyage to the tropics. “The man who has\r\nsome feeling for the beauty of Nature,” he says, “will find a more\r\npowerful restorative than climate on this lovely island. No place in the\r\nworld seems to me better calculated to banish sorrow and restore peace\r\nto an embittered soul.” Haeckel went there.\r\n\r\nIt was not an expensive journey, but it came as a fresh greeting from\r\nNature. It was a new ocean after the long studies on the Mediterranean.\r\nWhat might it not afford in the way of medusæ and other zoological\r\nprizes when the general beauty of the landscape, that had enchanted\r\nHumboldt, had been fully enjoyed. With a mingling of his overflowing\r\npassion for Nature, and the gloomy fatalism that told him this would be\r\nhis “last voyage” after his “last book,” he asked permission to leave\r\nJena in the autumn of 1866, when the printing of the _Morphology_ was\r\ncompleted, and set out. It was no more to be his last voyage than the\r\n_Morphology_ to be his last testament. Although still subdued with\r\nresignation in his inner life, he came home in the spring of 1867 with a\r\nnew elasticity of body and mind, restored by the influence of the palms\r\nand bananas and spurge, and braced for the great struggle of his life\r\nthat was now to begin in earnest.\r\n\r\nThe voyage had really two aims. To see the volcano above a palm-clad\r\ncoast, with the Atlantic Ocean bringing its medusæ; and to work for\r\nDarwin.\r\n\r\nA personal connection between the two had already been formed as a\r\nmatter of course. Darwin, almost confined for years to his isolated home\r\nat Down owing to his constant ill-health, had received a copy of the\r\n_Radiolaria_, and the correspondence had begun. The work had as yet met\r\nwith little encouragement from the ranks of exact scientists. It cannot\r\nhave been a matter of indifference to Darwin personally that so\r\ndistinguished a work, a real model of professional research, had come\r\nover to him. Proofs of the _Morphology_ were sent over to Down before\r\nthe book was ready for publication. Darwin read German with difficulty,\r\nbut in this case he was stimulated to make an unusual effort. At last\r\nHaeckel himself made his appearance at the master’s home. It seemed as\r\nthough he had to visit him in person to receive his blessing. It was, at\r\nall events, a happy moment in the history of Darwinism when the two men\r\nfirst met whose names will be inseparable in literature.\r\n\r\nThis was in October, 1866; Darwin had sent his carriage to bring Haeckel\r\nfrom the station. A sunny autumn morning smiled on the homely and\r\nbeautiful English landscape with its bright woods and golden broom and\r\nred erica and evergreen oaks. Haeckel has described their first meeting.\r\n“When the carriage drew up before Darwin’s house, with its ivy and its\r\nshadowy elms, the great scientist stepped out of the shade of the\r\ncreeper-covered porch to meet me. He had a tall and venerable\r\nappearance, with the broad shoulders of an Atlas that bore a world of\r\nthought: a Jove-like forehead, as we see in Goethe, with a lofty and\r\nbroad vault, deeply furrowed by the plough of intellectual work. The\r\ntender and friendly eyes were overshadowed by the great roof of the\r\nprominent brows. The gentle mouth was framed in a long, silvery white\r\nbeard. The noble expression of the whole face, the easy and soft voice,\r\nthe slow and careful pronunciation, the natural and simple tenor of his\r\nconversation, took my heart by storm in the first hour that we talked\r\ntogether, just as his great work had taken my intelligence by storm at\r\nthe first reading. I seemed to have before me a venerable sage of\r\nancient Greece, a Socrates or an Aristotle.”\r\n\r\nThey were delighted to meet each other, for they were like natures, in\r\ntheir best qualities. Darwin had more passion in him than he ever\r\nexpressed, and behind all Haeckel’s impetuosity there was the naïve and\r\nyielding temper of the child. He poured out his anger against the\r\nstubborn and bewigged professors who still held out against the luminous\r\ntruth of the theory of evolution. Darwin put his hand on his shoulder,\r\nsmiled, and said they were rather to be pitied than blamed, and that\r\nthey could not keep back permanently the stream of truth. At heart,\r\nhowever, he was delighted with his fiery pupil. They were to fight their\r\nbattle shoulder to shoulder for seventeen years. During all those years\r\nthere was never the slightest disturbance of their friendship. Darwin\r\nknew well what an auxiliary he had in Haeckel. It is true that he wrote\r\nhim a wonderful letter occasionally, in which he used the right of a\r\nsenior to warn Haeckel not to deal so violently with his opponents.\r\nViolence only had the effect of making onlookers side with the party you\r\nattacked. We must be careful not to be too hasty in setting things up as\r\npositive truths, as we see every day people starting from the same\r\npremises and coming to opposite conclusions. But he was generally at one\r\nwith Haeckel, and had the good spirit to acknowledge it openly. When\r\nHaeckel’s _History of Creation_ raised up the most extreme parties, and\r\nstarted the cry that a distinction must be drawn at once between\r\nDarwin’s real scientific ideas and Haeckel’s desperate excursions into\r\nnatural philosophy, Darwin said, in the _Descent of Man_, which he had\r\nbegun much earlier, but did not publish for some time, that he would\r\nnever have written his book if he had then known Haeckel’s _History of\r\nCreation_. Haeckel had anticipated so much that he wished to say. And\r\nwhen Virchow attacked Haeckel in 1877, Darwin spoke very severely of the\r\nopponents who would make the eternal freedom to teach the truth\r\ndependent on the accidental conditions of a modern State. Haeckel\r\nvisited him twice at Down. On February 12, 1882, he sent Darwin his\r\ncongratulations on his seventy-third birthday from the summit of Adam’s\r\nPeak in Ceylon. This was his last greeting. Darwin died two months\r\nafterwards. There was a touch of romance in this last communication of\r\nthe two great warriors. On the summit of the mountain, almost as sharp\r\nas a needle, and 2,500 yards above the Indian Ocean, a tiny temple of\r\nBuddha hangs like a stork’s nest suspended by chains. Buddha is believed\r\nto have left his footprints on the rocks here. The Mohammedan tradition,\r\nhowever, says it was done by Adam as he stood on one foot and bemoaned\r\nthe loss of Paradise. In front of this holy trace, a depression in the\r\nrock about a foot long, Haeckel made a speech to his travelling\r\ncompanions, and they broke the neck of a bottle of Rhine wine to\r\nDarwin’s health. It is no little stretch of humanity’s pilgrimage, from\r\nAdam to Buddha and on to Darwin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ERNST HAECKEL AND HIS ASSISTANT MIKLUCHO-MACLAY\r\n  AT LANZAROTE, IN THE CANARIES, 1867.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1866, Haeckel had a companion in a teacher from Bonn,\r\nRichard Greeff (afterwards professor of zoology at Marburg). They took\r\nship from London to Lisbon, where they were long detained for\r\nquarantine, though the annoyance was somewhat relieved by the discovery\r\nof an interesting medusa in the brackish water of the Tagus. They then\r\nwent to Madeira and Teneriffe, not right into the tropics, but where\r\nthey might get a breath of it, as it were. Two of Haeckel’s pupils, who\r\nboth became well known afterwards, Miklucho-Maclay and Fol, were with\r\nthem. Greeff has given a full account of the journey in a whole volume\r\n(published at Bonn, 1868), and Haeckel has written of it in two\r\narticles, one of which (in the fifth volume of the _Zeitschrift der\r\nGesellschaft für Erdkunde_, Berlin, 1870) is a perfect masterpiece of\r\nnarrative and description of scenery. After a long search they chose as\r\nthe best station for studying marine animals, especially the medusæ, the\r\nlittle island of Lanzarote, instead of one of the chief islands. Here\r\nthey fished and drew, in the manner taught by Johannes Müller, for three\r\nmonths, from December, 1866, to February, 1867. It is not exactly an\r\nideal place. “Imagine yourself dumped down on the moor!” Haeckel said\r\nafterwards in his description of it. A piece of arid land that looked\r\nlike a strip of the Sahara in the middle of the ocean. There is hardly\r\nany water, and the vegetation is correspondingly meagre. Across the\r\nmiddle of the island stretches a chain of volcanic craters, and old\r\nlava-fields run down from them as far as the coast. Everything of\r\nzoological interest in the place was to be found in the sea. There they\r\nfound abundance. As in Messina, certain local currents drove the rich\r\nanimal plancton together until there were literally rivers or streets of\r\ntiny animals. One had only to dip in one’s nets and glasses, and bring\r\nup whole shoals with every drop of water.\r\n\r\nHaeckel had come chiefly to study the medusæ. But this led him on much\r\nfurther to a great zoological problem. In his _General Morphology_ he\r\nhad expounded his brilliant ideas on the subject of individuality, and\r\nnow he encountered in the flesh one of the greatest marvels of animal\r\nindividuality. He had shown how the higher individual is always made up\r\nof a community, a kind of state, of lower individuals. In the simplest\r\ninstance there are the cells. Each of them is an individual. Millions of\r\nthese individuals, banded together with division of labour for great\r\ncollective operations, make up the human frame, and therefore the human\r\n“individual.” In the same way others form a beetle, a snail, or a single\r\nmedusa. Sometimes, however, these higher individuals enter in turn into\r\nsocial combinations to form still higher communities. Human beings form\r\nsocial commonwealths, with division of labour among the individuals.\r\nBees and ants form their communities in the same way. But in the latter\r\ncases the texture of the community seems to be much looser than in the\r\npreceding one. It is not so easy for the imagination to grasp a human\r\ncommonwealth or a colony of bees as a real “over-individual.” It is,\r\ntherefore, extremely instructive to find that at least one animal\r\ncommunity of this kind is of so firm a texture that even on the most\r\nsuperficial examination it is recognised at once as an individual. This\r\nis found in one of the groups of the medusæ, the siphonophores, or\r\nsocial medusæ.\r\n\r\nA number of single medusæ, each of which corresponds to what we regard\r\nas the individual man, combine and form a new body, a social individual.\r\nAs citizens of this new state they have introduced the most rigid\r\ndivision of labour. One medusa does nothing but eat, and it thus\r\nprovides nourishment for the rest, as they are all joined in one body.\r\nAnother accomplishes the swimming movement; another has been converted\r\nentirely into a reproductive organ. In a word, the whole has become a\r\n“unity” once more, equipped with its various organs like any large body.\r\nSometimes thousands of separate medusæ enter into the structure of one\r\nof these wonders of the deep. And as each of the medusæ is generally a\r\nvery pretty, flower-like creature, the social groups with their charming\r\ncolours look like floating garlands of flowers made of transparent and\r\ntinted crystal. Their beauty would soon fix Haeckel’s attention, but\r\ntheir bearing on his theory of individuality would give them an even\r\ngreater value. For several years he had searched most attentively in the\r\nanimal world for these “over-individuals” of the highest class. In the\r\nmorphology he had had to be content with an old illustration of\r\nsomething of the kind, the star-fish. It was supposed to be a\r\ncombination of vermalians. In this case the hypothesis has broken down,\r\nthough there was a good deal to be said for it at first, and it was\r\nabandoned by him afterwards. But now, when he saw enormous numbers of\r\nsiphonophores in the animal streams at Lanzarote, he entered upon a\r\ndecisive study of the meaning of these real “social animals.” A social\r\nmedusa has so great an appearance of unity that those who discovered it\r\nfirst did not believe it was a community, but a very complicated\r\nindividual medusa. Vogt (1847) and Leuckart (1851) had denied this, and\r\ndeclared it to be a social group. But the controversy was still going\r\non, as there was much difference of opinion as to the meaning of\r\n“social” and “state.” Haeckel now succeeded at Lanzarote in tracing for\r\nthe first time the development of one of these siphonophores from the\r\novum. He was able to show that from the ovum only a single simple medusa\r\nis developed. This, then, becomes the parent of the community; it\r\nproduces the rest of the members, not by a new sexual generation, but by\r\nbudding out from itself, until the whole garland of connected\r\nindividuals is ready to constitute the new over-individual, or the\r\ncommunity. These luminous investigations were published three years\r\nafterwards (1869) in a work that was crowned by the Utrecht Society of\r\nArt and Science (_The Embryology of the Siphonophoræ_, with fourteen\r\nplates, published at Utrecht). But Haeckel returned time after time in\r\nlater years to this group of animals with such great philosophic and\r\nzoological interest. When he had put before him in the eighties the\r\nwhole of the siphonophores brought home by the splendid _Challenger_\r\nexpedition, he combined the material with the results of his own studies\r\nin a fine work, which was included (in English) in the publications of\r\nthe _Challenger_ series at London, as the 28th volume of the _Zoology of\r\nthe Challenger_, 1888. The voluminous work is illustrated with fifty\r\nmasterly plates, some of them coloured, by Haeckel himself. The most\r\nimportant part of the text was also published in German at Jena, with\r\nthe title, _System of the Siphonophoræ_. There is a good popular account\r\nof the siphonophore question in his lecture on “The Division of Labour\r\nin Nature and in Human Life” (1869). A few of these beautiful forms are\r\nalso given on coloured plates in his illustrated work, _Art-forms in\r\nNature_. Every thoughtful man ought, whatever his position is as regards\r\nHaeckel’s ideas, to glance at this material that he has so vigorously\r\nand clearly presented.\r\n\r\nWhile he was conducting this research into the embryonic development of\r\nthe siphonophores, Haeckel made certain experiments on phenomena that\r\nhave lately been made the subject of a special “experimental mechanical\r\nembryology” by some of his pupils, particularly Professor Roux, of\r\nHalle. He cut up siphonophore ova into several pieces at the\r\ncommencement of their development, and saw an incomplete social medusa\r\ndevelop from each fragment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A SIPHONOPHORE\r\n  (_Disconalia gastroblasta._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThus the journey, like the earlier one to Messina, brought the\r\nindefatigable student into touch once more with a “philosophical\r\nanimal.” This alone would have made it well worth the trouble. How many\r\nmore of the kind the future might still have in reserve for him! In the\r\nquiet months at Puerto del Arrecise, on Lanzarote, he was gradually\r\nrestored to his spiritual balance. Nature had taken much from him, but\r\nshe offered him an inexhaustible return. His elasticity and vigour of\r\nframe had been restored before he left Teneriffe. In a twenty-two hours’\r\ntour, only interrupted by two hours’ sleep, he had climbed to the\r\nhighest summit of the Peak, in such an unfavourable season (in the\r\nNovember snow) that the native guides would not go any further in the\r\nend; all those who were with him except one stopped short a little way\r\nfrom the top. The short rest at the summit (4,128 yards above the\r\nsea-level, on the icy edge of the crater) was greatly enjoyed by him. He\r\ncould see over a distance of 5,700 square miles, as much as one-fourth\r\nof the whole of Spain. “The extraordinary range and height of the\r\nhorizon gives one a vague idea of the infinity of space. The deep\r\nunbroken silence and the consciousness that we have left all animal and\r\nvegetal life far behind, produce a profound feeling of solitude. One\r\nfeels oneself, with a certain pride, master of the situation that has\r\nbeen secured with so much trouble and risk. But the next moment one\r\nfeels what we really are—momentary waves in the infinite ocean of life,\r\ntransitory combinations of a comparatively small number of organic\r\ncells, which, in the last resort, owe their origin and significance to\r\nthe peculiar chemical properties of carbon. How small and mean at such\r\nmoments do we find the little play of human passions that unfolds itself\r\nfar below in the haunts of civilisation! How great and exalted in\r\ncomparison does free Nature seem, as it unrolls before us, in one vast\r\npicture, the whole majesty and splendour of its creative power!” Thus he\r\nhimself describes the moment. Something of that feeling of exalted\r\nsolitude entered into his life. He stood firm and undazed—come what\r\nmight.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                            GROWTH OF IDEAS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Easter, 1867, Haeckel returned to Jena through Morocco, Madrid,\r\nand Paris. He spent a few of the pleasant spring weeks at the Strait\r\nof Gibraltar and in the South of Spain. In the fine bay of Algeciras\r\n(opposite to Gibraltar on the west) the current of the Strait\r\nbrought swarms of interesting medusæ, siphonophores, and other\r\n“plancton-animals” into his net. In his solitary walks through the\r\nmountain forests of Andalusia, in the incomparable Moorish palaces\r\nand the cathedrals of Seville and Cordova, Granada and the Alhambra,\r\nhe gazed on that wealth of Spain in treasures of Nature and Art\r\nwhich had excited his boyish imagination in the vivid pictures of\r\nWashington Irving.\r\n\r\nWith his return home a crisis occurred in his career, from our\r\nbiographical point of view, such as we find at one point or other in the\r\nlives of all great men. Up to the present the course of his life has\r\nadvanced steadily onward, so that the simple chronological order\r\nafforded the most natural thread for our narrative. With this crisis his\r\nactivity broadens out more. His ideas, almost all of which are presented\r\nin the _General Morphology_, form a great and continuous stem, which\r\nthrows out a large or a small flower on one side or other, according to\r\nthe stimulus received. His life crystallises about Jena; however many\r\njourneys he makes, he always feels that he will return to his centre at\r\nJena. Nothing in his later career ever shook him from this ideal and\r\npersonal base.\r\n\r\nIn the summer after his return to Jena, 1867, he married Agnes Huschke,\r\ndaughter of the distinguished Jena anatomist. He shares the happiness of\r\nthis second marriage down to the present day. Of their three children,\r\nthe son is now a gifted artist at Munich; the elder daughter is the wife\r\nof Professor Hans Meyer, proprietor of the Leipsic Bibliographical\r\nInstitute, who is particularly known in science by his ascent of the\r\nKilimandschars; the younger daughter is still at home with her parents.\r\n\r\nHe never leaves the University of Jena—and it never abandons him. It is\r\na kind of spiritual marriage. In 1865, when the sky was still free from\r\nclouds, he was invited to take a position at Würtzburg, his old\r\nschool-place. He declined the invitation, and was then appointed\r\nordinary professor at Jena. Then the evil days came. The conclusions of\r\nhis _Morphology_ were popularised by himself, and went out far and wide\r\namongst the masses. People opened their eyes to find that this audacious\r\nscientist was making “war upon God” out of his zoology. At length the\r\ndifficult question arises whether a mind of that type can be retained in\r\nthe honourable position of official professor. The Philistines are in\r\narms. The quiet, stubborn group, that has vegetated unchanged, like a\r\ndemoralised parasitic animal, from Abdern to Schilda, through thousands\r\nof years of the free development of the mind, boycots the professor and\r\nhis family for a time. The Philistines appeal from their safe corner to\r\nthe authorities to intervene. Once, towards the close of the sixties,\r\nthe situation threatened to become really critical. The head of the\r\ngoverning body of the university at the time was Seebeck, a\r\ndistinguished man who by no means shared Haeckel’s views, but had a just\r\nfeeling of Haeckel’s honourableness and mental power. In the middle of\r\nthe struggle Haeckel approaches him one day, and says that he is\r\nprepared to resign his position, a sacrifice to his ideas. Seebeck\r\nreplied, “My dear Haeckel, you are still young, and you will come yet to\r\nhave more mature views of life. After all, you will do less harm here\r\nthan elsewhere, so you had better stop here.” At Jena they still tell a\r\nsimilar story that happened on another occasion. A stern theologian\r\npresented himself in person at the chateau of Karl Alexander, Grand Duke\r\nof Weimar, and begged him to put an end to this scandal of the\r\nprofessorship of Haeckel, the arch-heretic. The Grand Duke, educated in\r\nthe Weimar tradition of Goethe, asked, “Do you think he really believes\r\nthese things that he publishes?” “Most certainly he does,” was the\r\nprompt reply. “Very good,” said the Grand Duke, “then the man simply\r\ndoes the same as you do.”\r\n\r\nHaeckel remained a professor at Jena; and when the current subsided a\r\nlittle, he was not insensible of their liberality. He remained faithful\r\nto Jena, though even Vienna, amongst other places, offered him a\r\nposition (1871). Under his guidance “zoological” Jena flourished like a\r\npoor orphan that has suddenly been enriched. At one stroke the\r\nuniversity was lifted to the position of an intellectual metropolis for\r\nthe whole of the young scientific generation of the last quarter of the\r\ncentury. The best of the younger men that fill the biological positions\r\nin Germany to-day (and many others) were educated under Haeckel. Many of\r\nthese pupils became opponents of his eventually, but they all went\r\nthrough his system. He had a further satisfaction. He not only attracted\r\nthe young men to Jena, but he conjured up as if by magic the financial\r\nresources for improving the external advantages of the place for\r\nteaching and working. His style of “zoology,” which was at the same time\r\n“natural philosophy,” brought people to his assistance who would never\r\nhave been won by a narrowly technical zoologist, no matter how learned\r\nhe was. Twice men were induced “for his sake”—that is to say, induced by\r\nthe magnetic force of his charming personality—to leave large legacies\r\nto be spent on the university under his direction; once it was the\r\nCountess Bose, another time Paul von Ritter of Basle. Ritter alone gave\r\nsufficient to found two professorships at Jena for the express purpose\r\nof teaching the science of phylogeny that Haeckel had created.\r\n\r\nAll through the period of his long stay at Jena that followed we trace a\r\nseries of continual holiday journeys. In these journeys he used to\r\ncollect the best material for his professional research, following the\r\nmethod he had learned from Müller at Heligoland, and had practised at\r\nMessina and Lanzarote. At the same time these travels were, like the\r\nearlier ones, the bath of eternal youth and health for “the other soul\r\nin his breast”; the artist, the lusty wanderer, I might almost say the\r\ninveterate Bohemian in him, was then allowed to have his spell of song\r\nand gaiety. In Jena he took deeper and deeper root as time went on.\r\nThere was something in him in this respect of a Persephone impulse, an\r\nalternation of winter and summer in his life. When the days of hard and\r\nwearing work were past, he would have to rush away into the free air,\r\ndown to the blue sea, to far and happy Nature. “Here I am a man—dare be\r\na man.” The duty of the zoologist of Müller’s school to go down to the\r\nsea to work came to his rich temperament, which included so much more\r\nthan mere “professional reasons,” with a splendid sense of\r\nPersephone-life: half his time in the cold North studying animal\r\nskeletons and dead bones by the burning lamp, the other half in the\r\nglare of the sun of reality, in living nature at its best. I will only\r\nquote summarily a few dates of these travels. In 1869 he spent the\r\nautumn vacation in Scandinavia. In 1871 he was in the island of Lesina\r\nin Dalmatia, where he, the arch-heretic, lived in a monastery with a\r\njolly abbot. From beautiful Ragusa he made an interesting excursion to\r\nCattaro and Montenegro. In 1873 he went to Egypt and Asia Minor,\r\nvisiting Athens, Constantinople, Brussa, and the Black Sea. The\r\nculmination of this journey was a visit to the splendid coral banks of\r\nTur, in the Red Sea. The Khedive, Ismail Pacha, put a Government steamer\r\nat his disposal for the journey. The excursion has been superbly\r\ndescribed by Haeckel himself in the little volume, _The Corals of\r\nArabia_ (1876). The same volume contains the first specimens of his\r\nlandscapes in water-colour. He spent the spring of 1875 in Corsica and\r\nSardinia. On that occasion Oscar Hertwig discovered, in his presence,\r\nthe process of fertilisation in the sea-urchin; his discoveries will\r\nlong remain a turning-point in the history of our knowledge of sexual\r\ngeneration (one of the deepest mysteries in nature). In the autumn of\r\n1876 he was at work on the coast of Great Britain, and reached as far as\r\nIreland. In the spring of 1877 he was at Ithaca and Corfu; in the autumn\r\nwe find him on the Riviera. In 1878 he went first to Fiume and Pola on\r\nthe Adriatic, and afterwards on an Atlantic excursion to Brittany,\r\nNormandy, and Jersey. In the autumn of 1879 he was in Holland and\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 he made the second longest journey of his life. He secured\r\npermission to absent himself from the university for six months, and\r\nwent to Ceylon. He left Jena on the 8th of October, and did not return\r\nuntil April 21, 1882. The traveller and æsthete in him revelled in this\r\nfirst plunge into the tropics. How he was taken to the enchanted land of\r\nIndia in the Lloyd steamer _Helios_, a pretty reminiscence of the\r\n“heliozoa” (sun-plants), a name he had himself invented; how he greeted\r\nhis beloved medusæ in their beautiful tropical forms of the Indian\r\nOcean; how he lived in the execrable but thoroughly tropical and\r\ninteresting Whist-Bungalow at Colombo, where mysticism and an unholy joy\r\nin card-playing occupied him until philosophic zoology came to crown and\r\nredeem everything; how he set up his zoological laboratory far from the\r\nworld at the Cingalese village of Belligemma (which he interpreted\r\n_bella gemma_, the “pretty jewel”), and fished with his Müller-net for\r\nradiolaria, medusæ, and siphonophoræ, for six whole weeks, to the\r\nintense bewilderment of the naked children of the palms; how he at last\r\npenetrated into the wildest virgin forests of Ceylon, where one heard\r\nthe heavy tread of the elephant and the roar of the panther—all this he\r\nhas described in his _Visit to Ceylon_, the freshest expression of his\r\ntemperament, which belongs utterly to the free, artistic half of his\r\nlife, when Persephone has her summer days in the land of flowers.\r\n\r\nHe himself regarded this journey, happy and favoured to the very last\r\nminute, as a crown and conclusion of his travels that could never be\r\nsurpassed. But many a long hour was to be spent in travel after that,\r\nand he was to make one journey that left Ceylon far behind him in the\r\nIndian Ocean. In the spring of 1887 he made a pilgrimage to the “Holy\r\nLand,” Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, Damascus and Lebanon. On this journey\r\nhe spent a delightful month on the island of Rhodos. In 1889 he had a\r\npleasant time on the beautiful island of Elba. In 1890 he visited\r\nAlgiers, where his innocent sketches and his anatomical knife brought\r\nsuspicion on him; they arrested him and threatened to shoot him as a\r\nspy. He has described the incident in his genial way in his _Algerian\r\nReminiscences_ which is, unfortunately, lost in a back number of some\r\nmagazine or other, like so many of the sketches of his travels. In 1897\r\nhe travelled over the whole of Russia, from Finland to the Caucasus, and\r\nvisited Tiflis, Colchis, and the Crimea. In the autumn of 1892 he\r\naccompanied Sir John Murray, of the _Challenger_ expedition, on a small\r\ndeep-sea investigation on the coast of Scotland. In the spring of 1893\r\nand 1897 he was at work once more in his beloved Messina, where he was\r\nnow honoured as a world-famous guest. In the autumn of 1899 he climbed\r\nthe Sabine and Corsican hills. As the second decade after his first\r\njourney to the tropics came to an end, he seemed to regard all he had\r\ndone so far as a small payment on account. In his sixty-sixth year he\r\nfelt the “home-sickness” for the tropics once more with such intensity\r\nthat he quickly made up his mind to go as far as the equator. He left\r\nJena on August 21, 1900, and (after a brief visit to the exhibition at\r\nParis) took ship at Genoa, on September 4th, for Singapore. His beloved\r\nItaly had provided part of the cost of the journey. In the previous year\r\nthe Royal Academy of Science at Turin had awarded him the Bressa prize\r\n(consisting of 10,000 lire) on account of his _Systematic Phylogeny_.\r\nOnce more the tropics revived the great impression made on him in his\r\nearlier visit. This time he spent only a few hours in Ceylon, and sailed\r\nfurther south. He landed at Singapore on September 27th, and sixteen\r\ndays afterwards went on to Java, and thus crossed the equator at last.\r\nHe enjoyed to the full the charms of the landscape with its volcanoes\r\nand virgin forests, during his stay with Treub at Buitenzorg, at\r\nTjibodas, and during his long journey across the greater part of the\r\nisland. At Tjibodas he celebrated the close of the nineteenth century\r\n[German calculation] by painting a fine water-colour of the smoke-canopy\r\nover the summit of the volcano Gedeh, touched and gilded by the east\r\nrays of the sun on the last day of 1900. On January 23, 1901, he went\r\nfrom Batavia to Sumatra, crossed the Sunda Strait in sight of the famous\r\nvolcanic ruins of Krakatoa, and spent six weeks in Padang on the\r\nsouth-west coast of Sumatra. This delay was largely involuntary, and due\r\nto an injury to his knee, caused by stumbling over a rail during a visit\r\nto an engineering establishment; but the time was by no means lost in\r\nthe middle of such glories. On March 31st he landed in Europe (at\r\nNaples) once more, after a safe voyage. The notes he made during his\r\njourney yielded another charming work, _Letters from the East Indies and\r\nMalaysia_ (1901). His spirit of enterprise is inexhaustible, and still\r\ncontinues.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithin this frame of his career we have now to study a growth of ideas\r\nand a continuance of research that tell of vigour, consistency, and\r\nsuccess in every line. It unfolds logically like a great work of art.\r\n\r\nThe _General Morphology_ stands at the parting of two ways. It afforded\r\na programme of an infinite amount of fresh technical research—the\r\nelaboration of his studies in detail, of promorphology, of his theory of\r\nindividuality, and of the phylogenetic system of living things; and the\r\nstrengthening of the laws of evolution, especially the great biogenetic\r\nlaw. On the other hand, there was the purely philosophic work to be\r\ndone: the gathering together of the general threads that ran through his\r\nwork, and the building of a new philosophy of life, based on a new story\r\nof creation, from the atom to the moneron, from the moneron to man, and\r\nthe whole to be comprised and contained in God. In a word, he might\r\nproceed in either of two ways from the _Morphology_: he might construct\r\nacademic zoology afresh, or he might write a work on the new God.\r\n\r\nWhen he came home from Lanzarote, the two ways seemed to coincide in\r\nfront of him; his work had, indeed, opened them out as one. But external\r\ncircumstances intervened. As things are, it was only his academic\r\ncolleagues that had any right to the new biology. A new book on God and\r\ncreation would go out to “the publicans and sinners.” Interest must be\r\nlit up amongst the people at large, where there was as yet only the\r\nfaintest spark. It appeared, moreover, that most of his academic\r\ncolleagues in 1867 had no wish to enter on the new path he had opened\r\nout. A new generation would have to grow up first. The _Morphology_,\r\nfrom which Haeckel on his travels had expected at least a revolution,\r\nmet at first with an icy silence. There was hardly any discussion of it,\r\nand no excitement whatever. Haeckel quickly made up his mind. He must\r\nturn in the other direction. Gegenbaur consoles him. He has given too\r\nmuch—twenty dishes instead of one. He must serve up the best part of the\r\nwork on one dish, and it will be taken. Haeckel agrees with him to some\r\nextent, but his heavy technical artillery cannot be simplified so easily\r\nas that. The only possible thing to do is to give an extract of it,\r\nwhich will make the broad lines of the system clear. But as soon as that\r\nis done, he sees that the extract is still only the general\r\nphilosophical part of it, and will not appeal to the general public.\r\n\r\nIt was such reflections as these that led to the writing of his _History\r\nof Creation_, a popular work.[5]\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Translated into English with the above title. Literally, the title is:\r\n  _The Story of Natural Creation_.\r\n\r\nThe chapters of this work were first delivered orally to students, in\r\nthe form of lectures, and formed a kind of introduction to morphology.\r\nThe lectures, retaining their lighter form, were then combined to make\r\nthe book. It was published in 1868, a small volume in a very primitive\r\ngarb. The success of the work was unprecedented.\r\n\r\nZoology and botany were treated philosophically in the _Morphology_.\r\nThat did not suit the professional scientists, who (as I said) crossed\r\nthemselves when they saw “natural philosophy.” In the _History of\r\nCreation_ the great problems of philosophy are dealt with successively\r\non Darwinian lines, from the zoological and botanical point of view. It\r\nwas like the sinking of a deep well amongst general thoughtful readers.\r\nPeople felt at last what a power science had become. The old riddles of\r\nlife were studied in a new light with the aid of this book. There was no\r\npredecessor in this field. Haeckel was absolutely the first to appeal to\r\nthe general reader in this way. It is true that what he gave them was,\r\nstrictly speaking, only an extract from his own _Morphology_, especially\r\nthe second volume. But as he now arranged his matter chronologically, he\r\nconverted his outline of a world-system into a “world-history”—a real\r\n“history of natural creation.” In the “Pictures of Nature” in the first\r\nvolume of his _Cosmos_ Humboldt had tried to bring the natural world\r\nbefore his readers as a great panorama, to be taken in at one glance.\r\nBut he strictly confined his study of nature to the things that actually\r\nexist; how they came to exist was not, he intimated, a subject of\r\nscientific inquiry. Haeckel proceeds to this further task. His panorama\r\nof nature does not stand out rigidly before us; it develops, under the\r\neyes of the observer, from the formless nebula to the intelligent human\r\nbeing. Even on the surface this was seen to be a prodigious advance.\r\nVery plain, but very attractive, it makes its way by the force of its\r\nconvincing dialectic, and places no reliance on the fireworks of\r\nrhetoric. The subtle power of it lies in the arrangement of the facts,\r\nwhich suddenly assume the form of a logical chain instead of being a\r\nshapeless chaos. Even if all the main ideas of the work were false, we\r\nshould be compelled to regard it as one of the cleverest works that was\r\never written, from the dialectical point of view. But the essence of\r\nthis cleverness is the way in which the grouping of the facts is made to\r\nyield the philosophic evolution, which is the thoughtful basis of the\r\nwork. As the world proceeds in its natural development from the nebular\r\ncosmic raw material until it culminates in the ape and man, the reader\r\nfinds himself at the same time advancing along a series of general\r\nphilosophic conclusions with regard to God, the world, and man. If at\r\nthe end he has retained the whole series of what are to him more or less\r\nnew scientific details, he is bound to find himself caught in a strong\r\nnet of philosophic conclusions.\r\n\r\nIn view of all this we can easily understand the different reception\r\nthat the book met with from friend and foe. People who had already\r\nassented to the main issues of the work on general grounds of\r\nprobability, were delighted to find these issues decisively established\r\nby the plain facts of science. On the other hand, those who would have\r\nnone of Haeckel’s philosophy now felt compelled, in view of this\r\ndreadful work, to call these alleged facts of science themselves into\r\nquestion. In face of this hostility it was some disadvantage that the\r\n_History of Creation_ contained a vast amount of technical material\r\n(such as the genealogical trees, the Darwinian laws, the explanation of\r\nthe facts of embryology, &c.) that could only be presented summarily in\r\nit, while the proper technical description and justification of them was\r\nburied in the thick volumes of the _Morphology_. Haeckel said, over and\r\nover again, that a certain thing had been so fully established by him\r\nscientifically in the other work that he was now at liberty to take it\r\nas a fact; and he accordingly built it up as such without prejudice into\r\nthe compact structure of the popular work. Readers who wanted to go\r\nfurther into the discussion of these facts had to look up the relevant\r\npassages in the larger book. But the great bulk of his opponents—amongst\r\nwhom we must count even many professional scientists—had never read the\r\ntwo volumes of the _Morphology_. They merely took the brief statement in\r\nthe _History of Creation_, which was really little more than a\r\nreference, and made a violent attack on the “fact” it was said to\r\nconvey.\r\n\r\nThis led to a great deal of confusion. As in this case a controversy\r\nover some petty zoological detail was always a “struggle about God,” and\r\nso agitated the opponent down to the most secret folds of his\r\nphilosophy, the usual consequences did not fail to put in an appearance.\r\nHaeckel was branded and calumniated personally. There has never been any\r\napostle in the world that some sect or other has not decried as a rogue\r\nand evil-doer, simply because he was an apostle. Wherever Haeckel has\r\nmade use of any material that did not seem to be absolutely sound in\r\nevery respect, he was not simply accused of making a mistake, not even\r\nof ignorance, but the whole thing has been put down at once to\r\ndishonesty and the worst type of bad faith.\r\n\r\nOne should bear in mind how very generally pioneer work of this kind is\r\nliable to err. Further, in the _History of Creation_ there is the danger\r\ninvolved in the popular presentation of the results of scientific\r\nresearch. Any man who has written popular works, or delivered lectures\r\nto the general public, knows what this means. There is little common\r\nmeasure between them. The truths of science are in a state of constant\r\nflux; it is of their essence to be so. To fish out a piece from this\r\nstream, fix it, and magnify it for the public with a broad beam of\r\nlight, really amounts in principle to an alteration of it; it is putting\r\na certain pressure on things, and giving them an arbitrary shape. The\r\nwork of popularising truths is so holy a thing in its aim that this risk\r\nhas to be run. We must take things as they are. We have two\r\nalternatives: either not to popularise at all, or to take the apparatus\r\nwith all its defects. We can diminish these according to our skill; but\r\nthere is a subjective limit to this skill in all of us.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of the _History of Creation_—Haeckel’s first attempt\r\nat popularising—had a good deal of inequality in this respect. To begin\r\nwith, the book had the air of an extempore deliverance. Its success was\r\nvery largely due to its being cast in this form. But there was a good\r\ndeal that could be improved here and there, and was improved in the\r\nlater editions of the work. In the tenth edition, as we now have it, it\r\nis a splendid work in regard to the illustrations, for instance. But the\r\nfirst edition was merely provided with a few very crude woodcuts in\r\noutline. Some of them were very clumsy. In comparing different\r\nembryological objects the same blocks were used sometimes, and this\r\nwould give rise to misunderstanding in the mind of the reader. For\r\ninstance, there was question of demonstrating that certain objects, such\r\nas the human ovum and the ovum of some of the related higher mammals,\r\nwere just the same in their external outlines. This fact is quite\r\ncorrect and established to-day. If I draw the outline, and write\r\nunderneath it that as a type it is applicable to all known ova of the\r\nhigher mammals, including man, there is no possibility of\r\nmisunderstanding. But if I print the same illustration three times with\r\nthe suggestion that they are three different mammal-ova, the general\r\nreader is easily apt to think, not only that they are identical in the\r\ngeneral scheme of this outline, but also in internal structure. He\r\nimagines that the ova of man and the ape are just the same even in their\r\nmicroscopic and chemical features. This leads to a contradiction between\r\nthe illustration and what Haeckel expressly says in the text. We read\r\nthat there is indeed an external resemblance in shape between these ova,\r\nbut that there is bound to be a great difference in internal structure,\r\nsince an ape is developed from the one and a human being developed from\r\nthe other. It would have been better if the general reader, who is not\r\nfamiliar with these outline pictures, had been more emphatically\r\ninformed in the text below the illustration that even the outline is to\r\nbe taken as a general and ideal scheme. In this sense we must certainly\r\nadmit that the illustration was bad, since it would lead to a\r\nmisunderstanding of the clear words of the text. But what are we to say\r\nwhen the opponents of Haeckel’s views viciously raise the cry of “bad\r\nfaith” on the ground of a few little slips like this, and suggest that\r\nhe deliberately tried to mislead his readers with false illustrations?\r\nAmongst the general public, in so far as it was hostile to Haeckel, the\r\ncharge blossomed out into the most curious forms. Some declared that the\r\nwhole story of a resemblance between man’s ovum and embryo and those of\r\nother animals was an invention of Professor Haeckel’s; others—we even\r\nread it now and again in our own time—went so far as to say that the\r\nhuman ovum and embryonic forms only existed in Haeckel’s imagination.\r\nAll these wild charges are of no avail. The human ovum, which\r\ncorresponds entirely in its general scheme to that of the other higher\r\nmammals, was not discovered in 1868 by the wicked Haeckel, but in 1827\r\nby the great master of embryological research, Carl Ernst von Baer. The\r\nconsiderable external resemblance, at certain stages of development,\r\nbetween the embryos of reptiles, birds, and mammals, including man, was\r\ndecisively established by the same great scientist. These really\r\nremarkable stages in the development of the human embryo, during which,\r\nin accordance with the biogenetic law, it shows clear traces of the\r\ngill-slits of its fish-ancestors, and has a corresponding fin-like\r\nstructure of the four limbs and a very considerable tail, can be seen by\r\nthe general reader at any time in the illustrated works of His, Ecker,\r\nand Kölliker (Haeckel’s chief opponents) or in any illustrated manual of\r\nembryology, and their full force as evolutionary evidence can be\r\nappreciated. Any man that constructs his philosophy in such a way that,\r\nin his conviction, it stands or falls with the existence of these\r\nembryonic phenomena, is in a very delicate position, apart altogether\r\nfrom Haeckel. His philosophy will collapse, even if the _History of\r\nCreation_ had never been written.\r\n\r\nThese curious discussions did not seriously interfere with the success\r\nof the book. In thousands and thousands of minds, in 1868, this little\r\nwork proved the grain of seed that led on in time to serious thought.\r\nFrom that time onward Haeckel knew that he had not only scientific\r\ncolleagues and academic pupils, but a crowd of followers. When he made\r\nan excursion into the northern part of the Sahara, as far as the first\r\noasis, twenty-two years afterwards, he met an artist there. They talked\r\nphilosophy, and the man, not knowing Haeckel, naïvely recommended him to\r\nstudy the _History of Creation_ as likely to give him most help. The\r\nlittle incident shows us something of the great pioneer work done by the\r\nvolume, something of its spiritual circumnavigation of the globe.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus the spiritual nucleus of the _General Morphology_ is introduced,\r\nwith great ability, to a much wider circle than Haeckel had dreamed of\r\nwhen he gave the _Morphology_ to his colleagues. But the agitation\r\ngradually spread into academic circles. On the whole the Darwinian ideas\r\npressed in everywhere by their own irresistible weight. Haeckel’s more\r\nparticular concern, however, was to secure the recognition of one single\r\npoint in the larger group of ideas—the great biogenetic law. This was\r\nfor many years the pivot on which almost all the discussions with him\r\nand about him turned.\r\n\r\nHe himself did not at first conceive his law as a matter of controversy,\r\nbut as a method that must be brought into a position of practical\r\nutility. An opportunity to do this arose immediately.\r\n\r\nWhile he was at Lanzarote he began to take an interest in a second group\r\nof lowly animals besides the siphonophores, namely the sponges. When the\r\ngeneral reader hears the word “sponge” he must modify his ordinary ideas\r\na little. In the present instance he must not think of the plants,\r\nbelonging to the fungi-group, such as the morel and cognate forms, that\r\nare often called “sponges” in common parlance. He must think rather of\r\nthe sponge he uses in his bath. The bath-sponge is a structure made up\r\nof very tough, elastic, horny fibres. This structure is originally the\r\nskeleton, as it were, of certain animals that are known as\r\n“sponge-animals” or, briefly, sponges; they have nothing to do with the\r\nspongy mushrooms I spoke of. At the same time these socially-living\r\nsponges are such curious creatures that it was disputed for a long time\r\nwhether they were real animals or not. There was a second controversy in\r\nregard to them as to where the “individual” began—what was a single\r\nanimal, and what a co-operative colony of animals. The latter point\r\nalone would have been enough to direct Haeckel’s attention to this group\r\nafter he had, in the case of the siphonophores, gone so deeply into the\r\nmystery of combined individuals, forming a new “state-individual.” His\r\nown opinion eventually was that as a matter of fact in the majority of\r\ncases the whole sponge is a stock or colony of separate sponge\r\nindividuals closely connected together. They had not, indeed, anything\r\nlike the ingenious method of division of labour that we find in the\r\nsocial medusæ; in fact, the sponges are in all respects much more lowly\r\norganised animals than the medusæ. But they were certainly true animals.\r\nAnd in the middle of his efforts to prove this Haeckel travelled into an\r\nentirely new field of research, lying far beyond the theory of\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\nAs there is an enormous number of different sponges, he had confined his\r\nstudies from the first to a single group of them that might be taken as\r\ntypical. He chose the calcispongiæ (calcareous sponges), which had been\r\nthe least studied up to that time. As the name obviously implies, these\r\nsponges form their internal framework or skeleton, not of elastic horny\r\nfibres like the common bath-sponge, but of solid calcareous needles or\r\nspines. They secrete these out of the soft substance of their bodies\r\njust as the radiolaria do their pretty siliceous houses. Haeckel was\r\nengaged for five years, from 1867 to 1872, in a profound and careful\r\nstudy of the natural history of the calcispongiæ. Then he published the\r\nresults in his _Monograph on the Calcispongiæ_, consisting of two\r\nvolumes of text and an atlas of sixty fine plates.\r\n\r\nThe first result was that the calcispongiæ afforded a splendid proof of\r\nthe impossibility of drawing sharp limits between species in the\r\nperpetually developing animal world. In their case the different\r\nvarieties passed constantly out of each other and back into each other\r\nin a way that would have made a classifier of the old type distracted.\r\nBut Haeckel had travelled far beyond the position of his boyhood, when\r\nhe had timorously concealed the bad species that would not fit into the\r\nsystem. He said humorously that in the case of the calcispongiæ you had\r\nthe choice of distinguishing one genus with three species, or three\r\ngenera with 239 species, or 113 genera with 591 species. All this\r\nconfusion was saved by the Darwinian idea of not setting up absolutely\r\nrigid classes, families, genera, and species. But even this was not yet\r\nthe essential point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ERNST HAECKEL, 1874.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs he had done in the case of the siphonophores, Haeckel endeavoured to\r\nderive as much information as possible from the “ontogeny,” or embryonic\r\ndevelopment, of the calcispongiæ. He established in some cases, it\r\nseemed to him, that a single calcisponge-individual at first and up to a\r\ncertain stage developed from the ovum in the same way as a medusa or a\r\ncoral or an anemone. The fertilised ovum, a single cell, divided into\r\ntwo cells, then several, and at last formed a whole cluster of cells. In\r\nthis cluster the cells arranged themselves at the surface, and left a\r\nhollow cavity within. Then two layers of cells were formed, like a\r\ndouble skin, in the wall of this vesicle, and an opening was left at one\r\nspot in the wall of it. Thus we got a free-swimming embryo, with a\r\nmouth, an external skin, and an internal digestive skin or membrane.\r\nThen the creature attaches itself to the floor of the sea and becomes a\r\nreal sponge, partly by developing along its characteristic lines, and\r\npartly (in most cases) by producing other sponges from itself in the\r\nform of buds, like the siphonophore, and so forming an elaborate colony,\r\nto which we give collectively the title of “a sponge.” These facts led\r\nto the following reflections.\r\n\r\nThis original development from the ovum, first into an embryo with the\r\nform of a small globe or, more correctly, an oval body consisting of two\r\nlayers of cells and having a hole at one pole—in other words, a creature\r\nwith nothing but skin, stomach, and mouth—was found, curiously enough,\r\nin other animals besides the medusæ, corals, and sponges. We have the\r\nsame course of development in representatives of the most varied groups\r\nof animals. There are worms, star-fishes, crabs, and snails that develop\r\nin the same way. In fact, it was proved in this very year (1867) that\r\nthe lowest of the vertebrates, the amphioxus (or lancelet), develops in\r\nthe same way. And this was not all. In the ontogeny of all the higher\r\nanimals right up to man (inclusive) we find a state of things that most\r\nclosely resembles the same development. At all events, the fertilised\r\novum gives rise in all cases to a cluster of cells; this cluster forms\r\nsomething like a flattened or elongated vesicle with a single-layered\r\nwall; the single layer of cells is doubled, and in the building up of\r\nthe body one half makes the external coat or skin and the other half the\r\ninternal lining or membrane. Haeckel reflected on the whole of the\r\nfacts, and drew his conclusions. This very curious agreement in the\r\nearlier embryonic forms must be interpreted in terms of the biogenetic\r\nlaw. In the case of the higher animals the forms have been profoundly\r\nmodified by cenogenesis. In the lower animals they are almost or\r\naltogether a pure recapitulation of the real primitive course of the\r\ndevelopment of the animal kingdom. In the earliest times animals were\r\nevolved in something like the following way. First, the primitive\r\nunicellular protozoa came together and formed crude social bodies,\r\nclusters of cells that kept together, but had no special division of\r\nlabour. As all the members in the cluster pressed to the surface, in\r\norder to obtain their food, they came to form, not a solid mass of\r\ncells, but a hollow vesicle with a wall of cells. Then the first\r\ndivision of labour set in. Certain cells, those that were situated at\r\nthe anterior pole, and so were better placed to receive the floating\r\nfood as the animal moved along, became the eating-cells of the group;\r\nthey provided nourishment for the others, as the nutritious sap\r\ncirculated through all the cells in the cluster, as we find in the case\r\nof the siphonophores. As these feeding-cells multiplied rapidly at the\r\nfore part of the animal, a depression was formed at that pole of the\r\nbody. In the end the ball or vesicle was doubled in upon itself, until\r\nit came to have the form of a cup with a double-layered wall. Externally\r\nwere the cells in the skin that effected movement and feeling, and\r\nafforded protection; inside, forming the internal wall, were the eating-\r\nor stomach-cells. An opening remained at the top—the opening of the cup\r\nor vase-like body. The food entered by it: it was virtually the “mouth.”\r\nThus was formed a primitive multicellular animal with division of\r\nlabour. If we imagine it attaching itself to the bottom by its lower\r\npole, we can see that it would easily become a sponge of the simplest\r\nkind, a polyp, a coral, or, detaching itself once more, a medusa. If we\r\nimagine it swimming ahead in the water or creeping along the ground in\r\nsuch a way as to assume a bilateral symmetrical structure, like a tube,\r\nwith right and left, back and belly, and an anus behind, we have a worm.\r\nThis worm developed, under the action of the Darwinian laws, into a\r\nstar-fish in one case, a crab or insect in another, a snail or mussel in\r\nanother, and lastly into the amphioxus, which led on through the\r\nvertebrates to the human frame. But the mysterious series of forms\r\nalways remained in the development of the individual from the egg,\r\npointing more or less clearly to the earlier stages: ovum, cluster of\r\ncells, ball, two cell-layers in a cup-shaped form, skin, stomach, and\r\nmouth. All animals that exhibit this primitive scheme belong to one\r\ngreat stem. It was not until this skin-stomach-mouth animal was formed\r\nthat the tree branched out—evolving into sessile, creeping, swimming,\r\nand other forms. Let us give a name to this phylogenetic (ancestral)\r\nform, which stands at the great parting of the ways in the animal world,\r\nas embryology proves. Leaving aside its innumerable relatives in the\r\nprimitive days, it must have differed essentially from all other living\r\nthings at the time—all the protists and the plants—by its possession of\r\na skin, stomach, and mouth. _Gaster_ is the Greek for stomach. Let us,\r\ntherefore, call this primitive parent of all the sponges polyps,\r\nmedusaæ, worms, crustacea, insects, snails, mussels, cephalopods,\r\nfishes, salamanders, lizards, birds, mammals, and man, the _gastræa_,\r\nthe primitive-stomach or primitive-gut animal. The corresponding\r\nembryonic form may be distinguished from it as the _gastrula_. There are\r\nstill many living species of animals that are very little higher in\r\norganisation than the gastræa-form. The _Pemmatodiscus gastrulaceus_,\r\ndiscovered by Monticelli in 1895, corresponds entirely to it. And the\r\ngastrula is found, as I said, with astonishing regularity in its precise\r\ngastræa-form in representatives of all the higher groups of animals.\r\n\r\nThat is an outline of the famous gastræa-theory, that Haeckel discovered\r\nwhen he was engaged in studying the calcisponges. It was first published\r\nin his large _Monograph on the Calcispongiæ_ in 1872, elaborated in his\r\n_Studies of the Gastræa-theory_ in 1873, 1875, and 1876 (published in\r\none volume in 1877), and generally expounded, together with the\r\nbiogenetic law, in (amongst other works) his polemical essay, “The aims\r\nand methods of modern embryology” (1875). This discovery, in Haeckel’s\r\nopinion, now made the biogenetic law a real search-light in the\r\nexploration of the obscure past. It indicated a third critical point in\r\nthe great genealogical tree. Already we had the root (the monera) and\r\nthe crown (man); now we had the point from which the various real animal\r\nstems radiated like the umbellate branches of a single large bloom.\r\nThrough it the Darwinian system had been converted into the greatest\r\npractical reform of animal classification. If this gastræa-theory was\r\ncorrect, it was an incalculable gain for zoology. The difficulty of it,\r\non the other hand, lay in the infinite modifications of the embryonic\r\nprocesses in detail that had been brought about by cenogenesis; almost\r\neverywhere this had more or less obscured the original features. On the\r\nwhole it gave rise to the greatest and most far-reaching discussion that\r\nhas taken place in zoology for the last thirty years, apart from the\r\nDarwinian theory itself. To-day, at the close of these three decades,\r\nthere are only two alternatives. One is that there is still an\r\nabsolutely mysterious and hidden law of ontogeny, that compels countless\r\nanimals over and over again to pass through these embryonic forms and\r\nassume a likeness to the gastræa. After all the eagerness with which the\r\nwhole school of embryologists opposed to Haeckel have sought, up to our\r\nown day, to establish such a direct law, we have not yet got the shadow\r\nof a clear formulation of it. The other alternative is that Haeckel is\r\nright in believing that he has discovered the correct formula in his\r\nphylogenetic interpretation of embryonic processes in accordance with\r\nthe biogenetic law. If that is so, the gastræa-theory is the crown of\r\nall his labours in technical zoology proper. Let us wait another thirty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe scientific controversy over the gastræa-theory was in full swing\r\nwhen Haeckel entered upon another bold experiment in the direction of\r\nthe biogenetic law. He thought it would be useful, instead of framing\r\nwider hypotheses, to take one single instance of one of the highest\r\nanimals, and trace the whole parallel of its embryonic and ancestral\r\ndevelopment down to its finest details. It would serve as an excellent\r\nobject-lesson. He would take it, not from some remote corner of the\r\nsystem, such as the sponges or medusæ, but from the very top of the\r\ntree, where palingenesis and cenogenesis seemed to have culminated in an\r\ninextricable confusion. But what example could be more appropriate and\r\neffective than the most advanced of all living things—man. He would\r\nwrite a monograph on man on an entirely new method; would show ontogeny\r\nand phylogeny confirming each other down to the smallest detail. It was\r\nanother great enterprise. And this particular subject was so interesting\r\nthat it would appeal strongly to the general readers of his _History of\r\nCreation_ as well as to the academic scientists. Man was a subject of\r\nsuch obviousness and importance to the layman that in this case there\r\nwas really no professional limitation of interest at all. Every detail\r\nin the most technical treatment of the subject would be taken into\r\naccount, and evoked his strongest sympathy.\r\n\r\nWhen Haeckel had fully matured this plan, he produced his\r\n_Anthropogeny_.[6] The word, founded on the Greek, means the “genesis”\r\nor “evolution of man.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  The fifth edition is translated into English, with all the plates and\r\n  illustrations, under the title of _The Evolution of Man_. [Trans.]\r\n\r\nThe work is a very able combination of two different aims. On the one\r\nhand it affords the technical student the outline of a wholly new and\r\ndistinctive manual of human embryology (up to a certain extent) and\r\ngeneral anatomy; and this is intimately bound up by his method with a\r\nkind of historical introduction to general anthropology. At the same\r\ntime the book forms a second part of the _History of Creation_. It\r\nbuilds up the most important chapter of the later work, from the\r\nphilosophical point of view, namely, that which deals with the origin of\r\nman, into a fresh volume; and it represents the first popular treatment\r\nof embryology on broad philosophic lines—a thing that had never been\r\nattempted before. Springing up from this double root, the work is\r\ncertainly one of the most successful things in the whole of Haeckel’s\r\nliterary career. Moreover, it is not merely a compendium of a larger\r\nwork, like the _History of Creation_. In spirit and form it is an\r\noriginal work, and gives his very best to the reader. As far as its\r\ngeneral effect is concerned, the double-address of the work has had its\r\ndisadvantages. The academic students who were hostile to it have once\r\nmore selected for attack certain excrescences and gaps that were merely\r\ndue to the exigencies of popular treatment. On the other hand, the\r\ngeneral reader found it, in spite of the popular form, on which\r\nHerculean labour had been spent—one has only to think of the details of\r\nembryology—a book that was not to be “read” in the ordinary sense of the\r\nword, but studied. The first edition appeared in 1874. A fifth edition\r\nhas now been published, equipped with the finest illustrations, both\r\nfrom the artistic and the scientific point of view, that have ever\r\nappeared in a popular work on embryology. We find in the _Anthropogeny_\r\nall that the nineteenth century has learned or surmised with regard to\r\nthe ancestral history of mankind. Even the gastræa-theory—the gastræa\r\nbelonging to man’s direct ancestry—is dealt with in popular fashion as\r\nfar as this was possible.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Anthropogeny_ was published Haeckel’s public position became\r\nmore stormy than ever. In professional circles a number of the\r\nembryologists had taken up an attitude of opposition to him; the most\r\nheated of them attacked his popular works continually on the ground that\r\nhe was popularising, not the real results of official science, but his\r\nown personal opinions. There was a great deal of truth in that. The only\r\nquestion was, which would stand best with the future, his or their\r\npersonal opinion? It does not alter the subjectivity of opinions that a\r\nfew people here and there combine and pretentiously constitute\r\nthemselves into a “science.” Posterity will deal coolly enough with\r\ntheir collective decisions. It will take every man of science as an\r\nindividual, and merely ask which of them came nearest to the truth. The\r\nname, the official science, will pass into the grave with many titles\r\nand decorations. All that will remain in men’s minds is the star of the\r\npersonality in its relation to the great constellation of contemporary\r\nhuman truth. However, as regards the particular embryological attacks of\r\nthese opponents, it seems to me to-day especially characteristic that\r\nsuch people are more and more abandoning the idea that it is only a\r\nquestion of contesting certain particular deductions of Haeckel’s\r\n_within_ the limits of Darwinism. They find themselves increasingly\r\ncompelled to throw Darwinism overboard altogether. Instead of its\r\nattempts to explain phenomena they are putting forward a confused claim\r\nof “direct mechanical explanations,” or relying on the sonorous old\r\nphrase, started in 1859, an “immanent law of evolution,” or retreating\r\ninto a despairing attitude of “I don’t know.” These clearer divisions\r\nwill make it very much easier for posterity to pass its judgment on the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nAfter the embryologists we have a considerable group of opponents on the\r\nanthropological side. The objections of these anthropological critics\r\nhave in the course of time narrowed down to the single argument that no\r\ntransitional form between man and the ape has yet been discovered. And\r\nfor many years now this position has not been held on serious scientific\r\ngrounds, but rather on ingenious and strained hypotheses. Because we now\r\nhave, in the bones found at Java by Eugen Dubois in 1894, the remains of\r\na being that stands precisely half-way between the gibbon and man. Hence\r\nwhat is called the anti-Darwinian and especially anti-Haeckelian school\r\nof anthropology to-day is mainly distinguished for its preference of\r\nmore risky and more subtle hypotheses instead of plain conclusions from\r\nobvious facts. Finally, there is the theological opposition to Haeckel\r\nthat increased with every book in which he put his ideas before the\r\ngeneral public and helped them (in their boundless professional wisdom)\r\nto realise the danger of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe year 1877 was a critical one in this respect. In the middle of his\r\nstruggles Haeckel retained all the simplicity of his nature. He saw that\r\nthe idea of evolution was triumphing over all obstacles and rapidly\r\nsecuring the allegiance of the best men of the time. On the 18th of\r\nSeptember, 1877, he spoke of this with unrestrained delight at the\r\nscientific congress at Munich. He described the theory of evolution as\r\n“the most important advance that has been made in pure and applied\r\nscience.” Then Rudolf Virchow delivered a speech at the same congress.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt whatever that in the period since Virchow had\r\nindicated a neutral field in 1863, in which science might effect “its\r\ncompromise,” Haeckel had boldly invaded that province. In the previous\r\nyear he had published a little work called _The Perigenesis of the\r\nPlastidules, or the Generation of Waves in Vital Particles_. It was\r\ndelivered in lecture-form at the medical-scientific congress at Jena in\r\nNovember, 1875, and then printed on the occasion of Seebeck’s jubilee,\r\nMay 9, 1876. Possibly it is the least known of all Haeckel’s works,\r\nthough in my opinion it is one of the most valuable in regard to the\r\nprophetic breadth of its intuition. It essays to establish a theory of\r\nheredity. In dealing with this deepest mystery of life psychic factors\r\nare pressed into service without reserve. Not only is the cell-soul put\r\ninto prominence, but the cell in turn is resolved into a number of\r\nsmaller units, the plastidules. Each plastidule is then conceived as a\r\npsychic unity. The souls of the plastidules are endowed with memory;\r\nthat is the root of heredity. They learn; that is the psychological\r\nexpression of adaptation. The little work offers a suggestion of a\r\npsychology of Darwinism that may very well become the nucleus of the\r\nwhole Darwinian structure in the twentieth century. But at the time it\r\nwas quite obvious that a man with such ideas as these was breaking with\r\nlusty fist through the sacred net that spread before Virchow’s reserved\r\nprovince. The hour had come, therefore, for Virchow to feel that he must\r\nexpel the idea of evolution from the whole field of science, and not\r\nmerely from embryology and anthropology.\r\n\r\nIt is very instructive to note how Virchow shifted his position a little\r\nin accordance with the time. In his judgment science _had_ to make\r\npeace. It had to make concessions in certain directions. In 1863 he had\r\nspoken of the “ruling Churches.” Now, in 1877, he speaks of the freedom\r\nof science in the “modern State.” The great _Kulturkampf_ had set in.\r\nThe Church was for the time being powerless in face of the State. Hence\r\nVirchow now plays off the State as the guardian of his tabooed province.\r\nThis time Darwinism is supposed to be threatening the virgin field in\r\nwhich we exact scientists make our peace with the State. At the right\r\nmoment he adroitly points out that the Social Democrats have taken to\r\nDarwinism. Every man on deck, then. That must not go any further. At the\r\nbottom it was the old contest. If one lays down as a general principle\r\nthat the scientific pursuit and presentment of truth has to respect\r\nneutral provinces and make concessions, every change in current affairs\r\nwill demand a fresh application of it. To-day it is some Church or\r\nother, to-morrow a State, the next day the momentary code of morals, and\r\nlastly some bumbledom or other that renews the prohibition to dissect\r\ncorpses, because our dissecting knives disturb the peace of mind of our\r\nPhilistine neighbours. Haeckel published a sharp reply to Virchow (_Free\r\nScience and Free Teaching_, 1878), in which he sought to show amongst\r\nother things, taking his stand on his political principles, that\r\nSocialism and Darwinism have nothing to do with each other.\r\n\r\nI will not go more fully into the controversy here. If one province of\r\nknowledge is to receive light from another at all, we must admit that\r\nthere is only one general truth. All stationary or reactionary political\r\ninterest is irreconcilable with the theory of evolution. That is clear\r\nfrom the very meaning of the words. As to the direction in which we must\r\nseek real political and social progress opinions are bound to differ\r\nvery considerably; it may be shown that the laws of evolution which have\r\nselected the various species of plants and animals can only be used very\r\nsparingly and cautiously for the promotion of human progress. But I\r\nbelieve that is quite an immaterial point in this matter of Virchow’s\r\nattack. The real influence of Darwinism on political questions is not\r\nthe chief question. The principle we have to determine is whether the\r\nfreedom of scientific research and the teaching of what the individual\r\nstudent believes he has discovered to be true are to have “external”\r\nrestrictions or not. The question is whether inquiry and teaching are to\r\nbe regarded merely as things “tolerated” and interfered with at will\r\namongst the various elements of modern life; or whether they are not to\r\nbe considered the very bed-rock of civilisation, and every agency that\r\nhas power for the moment is not doomed whenever it comes into collision\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nIn this momentous duel of the two men who were regarded at the time as\r\nunquestionably the most distinguished scientists in Germany it seemed to\r\nmost people for a time that Haeckel had gone off altogether into general\r\nand public questions with regard to the aim of research and philosophy.\r\nHe seemed to lend colour to the belief as he published, in quick\r\nsuccession, a number of new popular lectures (_Cell-souls and\r\nSoul-cells_, 1878, and _The Origin and Evolution of the Sense-organs_,\r\n1878), and at the same time published a collected volume of older and\r\nrecent _Essays_ _on the Theory of Evolution_ (one part in 1878, a second\r\nin 1879, and a new and enlarged edition in 1902). As a matter of fact,\r\nwe find him in these years occupied with a small but particularly\r\nwell-lit field of his whole work. It was not merely that in a few years\r\nhe buried himself in the primitive forests of Ceylon, in order to pursue\r\nhis special studies far removed from all civilisation for months\r\ntogether. Just at this date appeared the great monograph on the medusæ,\r\nwhich he had at length concluded. The first volume (_The System of the\r\nMedusæ_, with 40 coloured plates) was published in 1879, and the second\r\n(_The Deep-sea Medusæ of the Challenger Expedition and the Organisms of\r\nthe Medusæ_, with 32 plates) in 1881. And while these splendid volumes\r\nshowed his academic colleagues that he had no mind to remain entirely on\r\nthe outer battlements as a philosophic champion, he plunged up to the\r\nears in a new special study of a range that would have made even the\r\nmost enthusiastic specialist recoil.\r\n\r\nFrom December, 1872, to May, 1876, the English had conducted a peaceful\r\nenterprise that will be for ever memorable. A staff of distinguished\r\nnaturalists had gone on the ship _Challenger_ to explore the depth,\r\ntemperature, and bottom of remote seas. With the aid of the best\r\nappliances specimens of the mud from the floor of the ocean (sometimes\r\nmore than a mile in depth) were brought up at 354 different spots. It\r\nwas known from earlier deep-sea explorations that this slime on the\r\nfloor of the ocean, from a certain coast-limit into the deepest parts,\r\nis composed for the most part of the microscopically small shells of\r\nlittle marine animals. The living creatures that form these shells swim\r\nin the water of the ocean, partly at the surface and partly at various\r\ndepths beneath it. When they die the little hard coat of mail sinks to\r\nthe bottom, and as there are millions upon millions of them living in\r\nthe sea, thick deposits are gradually formed at the bottom that consist\r\nalmost entirely of these microscopic shells. The animals in question are\r\nprimitive little creatures consisting of a single cell, of the type that\r\nHaeckel has called “Protists.” Even in Ehrenberg’s time it had been\r\nnoticed that amongst the shells in the deep-sea mud there were, besides\r\nchalky shells, a number of graceful flinty coats that clearly pointed to\r\nthe radiolaria. The _Challenger_ expedition now made the great discovery\r\nthat vast fields at the floor of the ocean, especially of the Pacific,\r\nwere covered almost exclusively with these flinty shells. It was seen at\r\nonce that the few hundred species of radiolaria that had hitherto been\r\ndescribed by Haeckel and others were only a very small part of the\r\nmasses of radiolaria found in the ocean. The specimens of the deposits\r\nwhich were carefully preserved and brought home by the _Challenger_\r\ncontained such an immense number of unknown species with their flinty\r\nshells faultlessly preserved, that it was necessary to reconstruct the\r\nwhole of this wonderful group of animals. And who could be better\r\nqualified for the work than the man who had already made a name by his\r\nstudy of the radiolaria, Haeckel?\r\n\r\nWhen the English Government came to publish the results of the\r\n_Challenger_ expedition in a monumental work (of fifty volumes), he was\r\nentrusted with the work on the siphonophores, the corneous sponges, and\r\nall the radiolaria in the collection. For ten years, from 1877 to 1887,\r\nHaeckel devoted every available hour to the work of selecting the\r\nradiolarian shells with his microscope from these specimens of the\r\ndeep-sea deposits, and naming, describing, and drawing the new species.\r\nWhen he began his task 810 species of radiolaria were known to science.\r\nWhen he came to his provisional conclusion, ten years afterwards, though\r\nhis material was not yet exhausted, there were 4,318 species and 739\r\ngenera. They are described in the splendid work that he wrote for the\r\n_Challenger_ Report. It consists of two volumes of text (in English)\r\nwith 2,750 pages and 140 large plates, with the title, _Report on the\r\nRadiolaria collected by H.M.S. Challenger_. In the preparation of these\r\nplates (and in the illustration of all his later works) he had the very\r\nvaluable assistance of the gifted Jena designer and lithographer, Adolph\r\nGiltch. A good deal of new information with regard to the living body of\r\nthe radiolaria had come to light since 1862. In particular it had now\r\nbeen settled beyond question that they consisted merely of a single\r\ncell. There was, therefore, a good opportunity of reconstructing the\r\n_Monograph_ of 1862 with the new and more comprehensive work. The chief\r\ncontents of the English work (with a selection of the plates) were then\r\npublished in German, and appeared in 1887 and 1888 as the second, third,\r\nand fourth parts of the _Monograph on the Radiolaria_. A sort of\r\nsupplementary essay on the methods of studying the radiolaria and\r\ncognate “plancton” animals was published separately with the title of\r\n_Planctonic studies_ (1890). Though it was a moderate and tactful\r\ncriticism of the methods of some of his colleagues in this kind of work,\r\nit was “refuted” by them in a way that it would be difficult to\r\nqualify—in other words, it was fruitlessly assailed with charges of the\r\nmost general but most unpleasant character. In the English Report we\r\nfind two other volumes afterwards from Haeckel—the volume on the\r\nsiphonophoræ in 1888, and the _Report on the Deep-sea Keratosa collected\r\nby H.M.S. Challenger_ in 1889; these again opened up new chapters in\r\nzoology. The _Challenger_ work is the crown of Haeckel’s studies as a\r\nspecialist. To some extent the conclusion of it closes an epoch in his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWe will only touch briefly on what he has done since. It has not yet\r\npassed into the region of history.\r\n\r\nThe latest years in Haeckel’s constructive work are characterised mainly\r\nby _one_ idea. He had often been pressed to work up afresh the material\r\nof his _General Morphology_. He has not done so in the form that was\r\nexpected, but chose a form of his own. In the first place he took the\r\nsystematic introduction to the second volume, which had been the first\r\nable attempt to draw up the genealogical tree of the living world,\r\nbranch by branch, and, with the material that had accumulated in the\r\nsubsequent thirty-four years, built it up into a separate work. It had\r\nconsisted formerly of 160 pages: now it formed three volumes of 1,800\r\npages. There were forty years of incessant study embodied in it. It had\r\nthe title _Systematic Phylogeny_:[7] “a sketch of a natural system of\r\norganisms on the basis of their stem-history.” The first volume (dealing\r\nwith the protists and plants) appeared in 1894; the second volume\r\n(dealing with the invertebrate animals) in 1896, and the third (dealing\r\nwith the vertebrates) in 1895. Closely connected with it is his special\r\nsystematic study of the stem-history of the echinoderms (star-fish,\r\n&c.), with particular reference to paleontology (_The Amphoridea and\r\nCystoidea_ in the _Work in Commemoration of Karl Gegenbaur_, 1896).\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  It has not been translated into English. A recent reviewer in _Nature_\r\n  pronounced it to be Haeckel’s best work. [Trans.]\r\n\r\nHis academic colleagues had hardly begun to master this new phylogeny\r\nwhen Haeckel once more roused a general agitation by working up the\r\nphilosophic nucleus of the _Morphology_ in a more general form than he\r\nhad done in the _History of Creation_. This new work was _The Riddle of\r\nthe Universe_, “a popular study of the Monistic philosophy.”[8] It was,\r\nhe declared, his philosophical testament. In a few months 10,000 copies\r\nof the work were sold, and a later cheap popular edition ran to more\r\nthan 100,000 copies. It has also been translated into fourteen different\r\nlanguages. The controversy it excited has not yet died away. Already a\r\nsupplementary volume, _The Wonders of Life_, has followed it (1904).\r\nHaeckel had been working in this department with great vigour for many\r\nyears. He only made one appearance at a German scientific congress since\r\nthe Virchow affair. That was on September 18, 1882, in quiet and\r\nuncontroversial form. A little excitement was caused amongst those who\r\nsaw their salvation in keeping the gentle Darwin far apart from the\r\nimpetuous Haeckel when he read a rather free philosophical confession of\r\nDarwin’s. Their tactics broke down as the deceased Darwin passed into an\r\nhistorical personality and disappeared from the struggle of contending\r\nparties. In 1892 Haeckel wrote with great vigour in the militant Berlin\r\njournal, the _Freie Bühne_, on the new alliance of the Church and\r\npolitical parties in Germany, criticising the political situation on\r\ngeneral philosophical principles, and in opposition to Virchow’s spirit\r\nof compromise. In the same year he delivered at Altenburg a lecture on\r\n“Monism as a connecting link between religion and science.” In this he\r\ntook a conciliatory line, and showed how his philosophic views could be\r\nreconciled with any really sincere pursuit of truth, whatever aim it\r\nprofessed to have. The address closed with the words: “May God, the\r\nspirit of the good, the beautiful, and the true, grant it.” However,\r\nboth his criticism and his attempt at conciliation only led to further\r\nand more bitter attacks in certain quarters. His only reply was to bring\r\nout the first numbers of a fine illustrated work—a work that came from a\r\nquite different depth of his rich personality. This was the _Art-forms\r\nin Nature_ [not translated], a collection of beautiful forms of\r\nradiolaria, sponges, siphonophores, &c., for artists and admirers of the\r\nbeautiful. It was a work such as he alone could produce. “In the storm\r\ndidst thou begin: in the storm shalt thou end,” he might have said to\r\nhimself, in the words of David Strauss. The storm never left him. In its\r\nmood was flung off with ready pen the _Riddle of the Universe_. “Up, old\r\nwarrior, gird thy loins!” as we read in Strauss.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  Literally, the title is “World-Riddles,” or “World-Problems.” [Trans.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ERNST HAECKEL, 1896.\r\n  _From a photograph by Gabriel Max._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe biographical sketch of a living man does not close with a stroke,\r\nbut with three stars. They glow still, these stars. Under their\r\ninfluence much may yet happen—much struggle, much peace. In view of the\r\ngeneral situation of our time there is little hope that the last stretch\r\nof this extraordinary career will be spent in peace, though behind it\r\nall lies the peace-loving soul of an artist. But if Haeckel’s career is\r\nto be one of struggle to the last hour, he may console himself with the\r\nnoble words of Goethe:—\r\n\r\n              “And when at length the long gray lashes fall\r\n               A gentle light will broaden o’er the scene,\r\n               In whose effulgence our remoter sons\r\n               Will read the lineaments of yonder stars,\r\n               And in the loftier view to which they rise\r\n               Of God and man a loftier image hold.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                           THE CROWNING YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\n                           [By JOSEPH MCCABE]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Professor Bölsche closed his biographical sketch in 1900 with the\r\nthree stars that “still glowed,” he had little suspicion how widely they\r\nwould yet flame out before they passed from the firmament of biography\r\nto that of history. As it has proved, Haeckel was then only entering\r\nupon the period of vast popular influence which forms the closing part\r\nof his remarkable career. He had in 1900 a few thousand thoughtful\r\nreaders in several countries beside his own. To-day he is read by\r\nhundreds of thousands in Germany, England, France, and Italy, and the\r\nfourteen different translations of his most popular work have carried\r\nhis ideas over the whole world. To-day the thoughts of this professor of\r\nzoology in an obscure German town are discussed eagerly by bronzed and\r\nblackened artisans in the workshops of London, Paris, and Tokio, as well\r\nas throughout Germany. The reader will have noticed in the earlier\r\nchapters that the most dignified and disdainful of Haeckel’s opponents\r\nhave been the academic philosophers. In the year 1905 a Berlin professor\r\nof philosophy, a stern critic of his system, devotes a long special\r\nsection of his _History of Philosophy since Kant_ to Haeckel and his\r\nlong-contemned speculations. Why? Because, to quote his concluding\r\nsentences, “the far-reaching impulse that Haeckel has given will never\r\nmore die out. He has become a sower of the future. The glad echo that\r\nhis words have found in a hundred thousand breasts must stir every\r\nrepresentative of ruling power in Church and Science to make a closer\r\nself-examination, a closer scrutiny of received ideas. Does not the\r\nthought press irresistibly upon us that somehow or other we have entered\r\nupon the wrong path in our modern development?”[9]\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Otto Gramzow’s _Geschichte der Philosophie seit Kant_, p. 503.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter Professor Bölsche tells the moving story of the\r\nwriting of the _General Morphology_: the young man making his masterly\r\nappeal to the scientists of Germany, which he thinks they will read over\r\nhis grave. There is a singular parallel to this in Haeckel’s attitude at\r\nthe time when Bölsche closed his work. Haeckel had just written another\r\n“last will and testament,” another proud and defiant utterance of what\r\nhe felt to be the truth about God and man and nature. Once more he\r\nseemed to see the marble gates at the close of his career, and his\r\nsombre glance fell round on a world that was, he thought, sinking into\r\nreaction. This time he appealed to the people. The five years that have\r\nfollowed have witnessed an extraordinary response on the part of the\r\npeople. With the speed of a popular romance his work has flown through\r\nEurope. He has received a hundred proofs that, at all events, the ideas\r\nhe thinks to be fraught with salvation for humanity are being considered\r\nand discussed in wide circles that had never before known that there was\r\na “riddle of the universe.” He has been urged in the heart of the Sahara\r\nto read his own works. He has met, as he travelled on an Alpine railway,\r\ncultured nuns who told him they had learned evolution from “Professor\r\nHaeckel’s works.” He has looked down with mingled feeling on the wild\r\napplause of a gathering of thousands of Socialists. He has been\r\nimmortalised—strangest and last of all apotheoses—in an academic history\r\nof philosophy!\r\n\r\nThe present chapter will tell the story of these five stirring years. It\r\nwill aim at conveying to the English reader, by plain presentment of\r\nfacts, a full picture of the activity that has attracted or distracted\r\nthe attention of so many in the last few years. If Dr. Gramzow is right,\r\nif through these five years of indefatigable labour the aged scientist\r\nhas become a “sower of the future,” it is well for friend and foe to\r\nunderstand him.\r\n\r\nThere is only one respect in which one’s personal feeling may be allowed\r\nto tinge such a narrative as this. For good or evil Haeckel’s great\r\ninfluence on our generation is a reality. It is the biographer’s duty to\r\nrecord and measure it: the reader’s to appraise it. The future historian\r\nof the dramatic course of humanity’s ideals must be left to interpret it\r\nin cosmic perspective. Do the stars exult, or do they grow thinner and\r\ncolder in their light, over this great stirring? The far-distant\r\ngeneration, that will have reached the summit of the hill, will know. We\r\nwho, with narrow horizon, are cutting our fond paths up the slope, have\r\nbut the poor luxuries of faith and hope. Yet there is one aspect of\r\nHaeckel’s recent life that makes us almost forget the cosmic issues.\r\nThese five years have been, in literal truth, “crowning years” of his\r\naims. For all the slights and insults that have been showered on the\r\ngrim worker he has had a rich recompense of honour and love. Even if his\r\nideas are to fade and wither like his laurel crowns, it will be\r\nsomething for a future historian to record that a gentler and more\r\ngenial light fell about his closing years. As Gramzow says: “He _tried_\r\nto give us his best.”\r\n\r\nAn event that Professor Bölsche has only briefly alluded to in his last\r\ncrowded chapter was a fitting inauguration of the last decade of\r\nHaeckel’s career. On the 17th of February, 1894, his sixtieth birthday\r\nwas celebrated at Jena. The lover of nature and of the silent study\r\npasses uneasily through such functions, but the student of Haeckel’s\r\nlife must dwell on it. Jena had for some years realised that world-fame\r\nsomehow attached to the straight, smiling figure that it saw passing\r\ndaily to the Zoological Institute. It had witnessed the grave procedure\r\nof the boycott in the sixties. It had heard distinguished leaders of\r\nChurches, like Professor Michelis, brand his works as “a fleck of shame\r\non the escutcheon of Germany,” “an attack on the foundations of religion\r\nand morality,” “a symptom of senile marasmus.” It saw all these unworthy\r\nattacks sink into confusion, and a new era begin. It heard of greater\r\nuniversities competing for their professor and his refusal to leave\r\nthem. It saw Bismarck fall on his neck and kiss him repeatedly when, in\r\n1892, he headed the deputation to invite him to Jena; and it noted how\r\nthe Prince absolutely refused to drive through their town “unless\r\nHaeckel comes with me” in the carriage. It gave his name proudly to one\r\nof its fine new streets.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1894, Jena witnessed a remarkable celebration—remarkable\r\nnot only to those who had lived with him in the sixties. A marble bust\r\nof Haeckel was unveiled by Professor Hertwig, with noble speech, in the\r\nZoological Institute. A festive dinner, such as Germans alone can\r\nconduct, was held in the famous Luther-Hostel. More than a thousand\r\nletters and telegrams poured in from all parts of the world, and scores\r\nof journals awoke the interest of Germany. I have before me the\r\nprivately-published report on the celebration, autographed to “Agnes\r\nHaeckel.” Two lists in it catch the eye. One is a list of Haeckel’s\r\npublications. Apart from his long and numerous articles in scientific\r\njournals he has written forty-two works (13,000 pages, frequently\r\nquarto) in thirty-three years. All but two are pure contributions to\r\nscience: some of them are classical monographs of original research;\r\nmost are beautifully illustrated by himself. The second list gives the\r\nnames of those who have contributed towards the marble bust by Professor\r\nKopf, of Rome. It is worthy of science. It includes five hundred\r\nuniversity professors and heads of academic institutions in all parts of\r\nthe world, from Brazil and the States to Algiers and Egypt and India. In\r\ntheir name Professor Hertwig greeted Haeckel as one “who has written his\r\nname in letters of light in the history of science.” From Italy the\r\nMinister of Public Instruction sent the following telegram: “Italy, that\r\nyou love so much, takes cordial part in all the honours that the\r\ncivilised nations of the earth are heaping on you in commemoration of\r\nyour sixtieth birthday. In the name of the Italian Universities, which\r\nlove you so much and so much admire your undying work, I send you a\r\nheartfelt greeting and wishes for a long and happy and active career.”\r\nDr. Paul von Ritter gave 75,000 marks [shillings] for the erection of a\r\nmonument to Haeckel at Jena when the hour comes. He had previously given\r\n300,000 marks to be spent in the furtherance of Haeckel’s scientific\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nThe story so vividly unfolded by Professor Bölsche has explained how the\r\nestrangement arose between Haeckel and so many of his scientific\r\ncolleagues in Germany. It is not a little gratifying to find the names\r\nof some of his critics amongst the subscribers to his festival. The\r\npersonality, the aim, the self-sacrifice of the man, no less than his\r\ndistinguished special contributions to science, had won a superb\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1894-6 Haeckel published the _Systematic Phylogeny_. “We\r\nmay differ,” says Professor Arnold Lang of it, “as to the value of\r\nspecial or even fundamental opinions in it, but we must stand before\r\nthis work in astonishment and admiration: astonishment at the vast range\r\nof his knowledge—it would seem that one head could contain no more:\r\nadmiration of the intellectual labour with which the various phenomena\r\nare connected and the gigantic mass of material is reduced to order.”\r\nThe Royal Academy of Science at Turin judged the work the best that had\r\nbeen published in the last four years of the nineteenth century, and\r\nawarded its author the Bressa prize, a sum of 10,000 lire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HAECKEL AND A GROUP OF ITALIAN PROFESSORS.\r\n  HOTEL BRISTOL, GENOA, 1904.\r\n  Pavona.

The International\r\nCongress of Zoology met at Cambridge, and Haeckel was invited to deliver\r\nan address. He chose his ever-present theme—the evolution of man. The\r\nlong lecture, or essay, has been translated by Dr. Gadow under the\r\ntitle, _The Last Link_. The title is somewhat misleading, as only a page\r\nor two are devoted to “the last link.” Otherwise the little work offers\r\nstudents a most excellent summary of “our present knowledge of the\r\nevolution of man,” the title which Haeckel gave it.\r\n\r\nBut the last period of Haeckel’s career is associated chiefly with, and\r\nis really inaugurated by his now famous _Riddle of the Universe_,\r\npublished in 1899. To understand that work, to avoid the extremes of\r\npraise and censure that have been lavished on it, one must put oneself\r\nin Haeckel’s position at the close of the last century. Mr. Wells has\r\ngiven us a forecast of the coming social order in which the intellectual\r\nfew are separated by a wider and deeper gulf than ever from the workers\r\nand the women of the world. That keen-eyed and judicious social writer\r\nhas already modified his forecast, but there were symptoms enough of the\r\npossibility of such an issue a few years ago. In Germany the signs were\r\nominous to a man like Haeckel. The older Liberalism to which he belonged\r\nby tradition and conviction seemed in danger of being ground to dust\r\nbetween the upper and the nether stones of the new political mill—the\r\nincreasing strength of Social Democracy and the increasing and\r\nconsequent alliance of Conservative Kaiserism with the still powerful\r\nCatholic Church. Haeckel distrusted the power of Demos much as Renan did\r\nwhen he wrote his sombre dialogues in the seventies; and a political\r\nalliance with the Vatican opened out to him the grim prospect of a\r\nreturn to the Middle Ages. The freedom of research and teaching for\r\nwhich he had fought with unsparing vigour was, he thought, imperilled by\r\nthe new alliance, no less than the very existence of culture was\r\nendangered by the triumph of Social Democracy. His academic colleagues\r\nremained in that isolation which he had ever bitterly resented.\r\n\r\nIn face of this situation, which seemed to grow more sombre as the last\r\nyears of the century dragged on, his zeal for truth and progress had but\r\none outlet. He must appeal to the people. He must take the conclusions\r\nhe had so laboriously worked out in his _Systematic Phylogeny_, and\r\ntranslate them from scientific hieroglyphics into a demotic tongue. He\r\nmust nail his theses with his own hand on the cathedral door, like the\r\ngreat monk whose work seemed in danger of perishing. The partial success\r\nof his _History of Creation_ was encouraging, though that work had only\r\npenetrated into the first circle beyond the sacred academic enclosure,\r\nand was still unknown to the crowd. Gathering his strength for what he\r\nbelieved to be his final effort, he blew a blast that would reach the\r\nfar-off shop and factory. It must be no gentle note, no timid suggestion\r\nthat the scientific work of the nineteenth century had thrown doubt on\r\ncurrent religious notions. He was quitting the stage. He believed these\r\nthings were true, were established. The world must listen to them, must\r\ndiscuss them; and then the twentieth century would pass its informed\r\nverdict over his grave.\r\n\r\nSo he wrote a vigorous, an irritating, an awakening book. It must be\r\nread in this context. The charge of “dogmatism” so often hurled at it is\r\nnot without humour. It is generally raised by men who in the same breath\r\nhold their truths so dogmatically that they resent his very questions.\r\nThey forget, too, that the chief conclusions of the _Riddle_ are\r\nreferences to the larger work in which, soundly or unsoundly, they are\r\nprovided with massive foundations of scientific material. In England\r\nthere is some excuse, as the larger work is untranslated and unknown;\r\nthough one may resent the critic who charges Haeckel with egoism for his\r\nconstant references to his other works and then proceeds to ridicule the\r\nslenderness of the foundations of his theories. Further, it is too often\r\nforgotten that Haeckel opens his work with a rare warning to the reader\r\nthat his opinions are very largely “subjective” and his command of other\r\nsubjects than biology is very “unequal.” In fine, his constant and\r\nexaggerated allusions to the opposition he encounters from his\r\nscientific colleagues is, for any candid reader, a sufficient corrective\r\nof “dogmatism.”\r\n\r\nThe work lit up at once a flame of controversy that has hardly yet\r\ndiminished in Germany. Students have told me how, when some professor\r\ndropped the well-known name in the course of his lecture, the class\r\nwould split at once into two demonstrative sections. Ten thousand copies\r\nof the library edition of the work were sold within a few months, and it\r\nquickly ran to eight editions. This remarkable success irritated his\r\nopponents, and the wide range of the subjects touched in the work gave\r\nthem opportunities. Germany was deluged with pamphlets of offence and\r\ndefence. Some of Haeckel’s pupils replied to his opponents, but the\r\nmaster himself smiled through the storm. His chief critics were men with\r\nno competence in biology, and he was not minded to comply with their\r\nstratagem of withdrawing attention from the substantial positions of the\r\nwork. Dennert, the philologist, swept together all the hard sayings\r\nabout Haeckel that the fierce struggle of the preceding twenty years had\r\nproduced—Paulsen and Adickes, the metaphysicians, poured philosophic\r\nscorn on his pretensions to construct a theory of knowledge. Adickes, in\r\nparticular, met him with a vigorous fusillade of pure Kantism. It is a\r\ncurious commentary on this long philosophic disdain to find Haeckel\r\nawarded a prominent place amongst “the philosophers since Kant.”\r\n\r\nTwo points in this connection are noteworthy. Haeckel’s first sin\r\nagainst the ruling metaphysic of the nineteenth century was his “naïve\r\nrealism.” He had dared to think he could break beyond the charmed circle\r\nof our states of consciousness. He had dreamed that a real material\r\nworld lay here in space before the human mind came into existence; that\r\na living, palpitating humanity, not a bloodless phantasm in the mind,\r\ncalled for our most solemn efforts. Where the ordinary reader saw a\r\ntruism the metaphysicians recognised a deadly sin, and laughed Homeric\r\nlaughter. To-day we have, both in England and Germany, a strong claim\r\narising amongst the metaphysicians themselves for a return to a realist\r\nbasis. Haeckel’s second and chief sin was his claim to have thrown light\r\non the evolution of consciousness and his disdain of all study of mind\r\nthat was not grounded on evolution. To-day Gramzow writes: “The\r\ncriticism which he makes of Kant’s theory of knowledge from the\r\nevolutionary point of view is the greatest advance that philosophy has\r\nmade in that branch since Kant’s time.”\r\n\r\nThe most violent critics of the _Riddle_ were the theologians. It would\r\nbe improper here to enter into the controversy, and indeed Haeckel has\r\npaid little attention to his critics of late years. Some time ago a\r\nGerman religious magazine was sent to me in which one of his leading\r\ncritics had written a shameful article with the aim of alienating him\r\nfrom me. I at once wrote to him, and received a letter brimming over\r\nwith his hearty laughter at the idea that he might have taken any notice\r\nof what they said. The eminent ecclesiastical historian, Professor\r\nLoofs, made a ponderous attack on his incidental reference to the birth\r\nof Christ. As Loofs himself denied the divinity and supernatural birth\r\nof Christ, Haeckel felt little inclination to enter on a serious\r\nargument about the human parentage. The theologian was so much hurt that\r\nhe used language, as far as was consistent with a broad view of the\r\ntheological dignity, that came within legal limits, and then quoted to\r\nHaeckel the page and letter in the German code on which he might take\r\naction!\r\n\r\nBut a great counterpoise to these bitter attacks—attacks that forgot, as\r\nGramzow says, that “there is an ethic for the critic as well as for the\r\nman of science”—had now been provided. Men like Dr. Schmidt, Dr.\r\nBreitenbach, Professor Bölsche, and Professor Verworn rallied to their\r\nmaster, and conveyed a juster image of him and his work to the public.\r\nThe ominous silence of the great biologists was felt to mean that his\r\nviews were, in substance, no heresy to them. The man’s warm and\r\nenthusiastic zeal for truth and humanity, his earnest efforts to pierce\r\nthe barriers that shut off the treasures of science from the mass, could\r\nnot be ignored. A cheaper edition of his work was demanded, and it was\r\nsoon in the hands of more than 150,000 readers. Country after country\r\nimported his “gospel of Monism,” the stirring agitation spread to\r\nFrance, England, America, Italy, and on until it reached Australia and\r\nJapan. To-day fourteen translations of the _Riddle_ bear his teaching to\r\nthe ends of the world.\r\n\r\nLittle need be said here of the Haeckel controversy in this country. I\r\nremember well the day when the German work was submitted to me with a\r\nview to publication. It did not seem to have the stuff of a\r\nconflagration in it. I hazarded a guess that it would sell a thousand\r\ncopies, and thought that it contained so valuable a description of the\r\nevolution of mind that it should be published. It has sold, with rather\r\nless than the usual advertising, with no special machinery for pressing\r\nit such as is at the command of religious works—it has sold about\r\n100,000 copies. The success of the work astounded us. While we were\r\nbeing accused of “thrusting it down people’s throats” we could not have\r\narrested its circulation, had we wished, without positively refusing to\r\nrepublish it. Indeed, the last library edition has long been out of\r\nprint, though still in frequent demand. It has made Haeckel’s a familiar\r\nname in circles where even Spencer has been heard to be described as “a\r\ngreat balloonist.” Clergymen have written to their journals saying how\r\nthey heard the Monistic philosophy discussed by groups of paviors. Sir\r\nLeslie Stephen told me, on his death-bed, but with a momentary flash of\r\nhis old humour, how an Orkney clergyman had written to him for\r\nconsolation, as it was circulating amongst the fishers of that _ultima\r\nthule_.[10]\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  The reader who desires a summary of the criticisms passed on the work\r\n  may consult Dr. Schmidt’s _Der Kampf um die Welträthsel_ for Germany,\r\n  and my own _Haeckel’s Critics Answered_ for England. The only\r\n  biologist of competence who has written on it in this country is Prof.\r\n  Lloyd-Morgan (_Contemporary Review_, 1903), but his reply is indirect.\r\n  Sir Oliver Lodge has recently dealt with it at length in his _Life and\r\n  Matter_, but the distinguished physicist’s conception of life is in\r\n  extreme and general disfavour with the biologists of England.\r\n\r\nFrom the seething agitation he had aroused Professor Haeckel cheerfully\r\nwithdrew in the autumn of 1900 to make his long journey to Java. He now\r\nlived under the public eye, and amusing constructions were put on his\r\nmovements. American journalism arrived, by its peculiar methods, at the\r\nknowledge that he had gone in quest of bones of the “missing link.” A\r\nfew bones of a half-human, half-ape form had been discovered on the\r\nsouth coast of Java a few years previously, and the trained American\r\nimagination quickly constructed a theory, which as quickly crystallised\r\ninto fact. Haeckel had been heavily subsidised by an American\r\nmillionaire to discover more bones of the ape-man of Java. Not to be\r\noutdone, other journals added a rival subsidy (from the American\r\nGovernment) and a rival search. The sober truth was that Haeckel had\r\nused his Bressa prize fund, with a subsidy from the Ritter fund at Jena,\r\nto make a study of botany and marine life in the tropics. He was within\r\na hundred miles of the spot where Dubois had found his interesting\r\nrelics, but made no effort to go further. For him the evolution of man\r\nrested on too massive a foundation for a few bones to increase its\r\nsolidity. Once more he brought home huge cases of preparations, a large\r\nnumber of sketches (some of them touched up by Verestchagin, who was\r\nreturning on the boat from China), and material for the inevitable book.\r\n_Aus Insulinde_ is a charming and finely illustrated work of travel, but\r\nhas not been translated.\r\n\r\nBefore he left Jena he had, with his characteristic urbanity and\r\ndiligence, given personal replies to about a thousand letters he had\r\nreceived apropos of his _Riddle of the Universe_. The epistolary flood\r\nrose higher than ever on his return. The struggle had spread to England\r\nand France. He had returned to a cauldron of controversy. He quietly\r\nresumed his teaching at the university and attacked his still formidable\r\nliterary programme. Day after day the aged scholar—he was now in his\r\nsixty-seventh year—briskly stepped up to the podium at the Zoological\r\nInstitute and delivered his lectures, drawing his objects with a few\r\nquick strokes on the board or exhibiting the plates prepared by Giltsch.\r\nHe noted with a quiet gleam of satisfaction that a few ladies now\r\nventured into the “Materialist” circle. The new century had begun.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 he issued the cheap edition of the _Riddle_, of which 180,000\r\ncopies have been sold in Germany, with a reply to its critics. “The\r\ngreat struggle for truth,” he wrote to his friend, Dr. Breitenbach,\r\n“grows fiercer and fiercer, the more my work is attacked by the clergy,\r\nthe metaphysical schoolmen, and the erudite Philistines. I am\r\ncontinually receiving lively and sometimes enthusiastic letters of\r\ncongratulation from all parts of the world.” In the meantime he was\r\nengaged upon two important works, which he published in 1903.\r\n\r\nThe earlier edition of the _Anthropogeny_, of which Professor Bölsche\r\nhas written, was undergoing a thorough revision. New evidence was\r\npouring in every year in support of his sketch of the genealogy of\r\nhumanity. Dubois had discovered what is now admitted to be an organism\r\nmidway between the highest ape and the earliest prehistoric man. Selenka\r\nhad published wonderful studies of the anthropoid apes. Friedenthal and\r\nothers had shown the literal blood-relationship of the higher apes and\r\nman by a series of beautiful experiments. He must once more gather\r\ntogether the enormous mass of facts, and marshal them with his old\r\ncommand. For six months he worked incessantly on the new edition. A\r\nhundred pages of matter were added to it, a hundred fresh illustrations.\r\nGreat and exacting as the task would have been for a younger man, the\r\nwork appeared in 1903 in a form that silenced criticism. I need only\r\nquote a sentence from the notice of it that was published in the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ by one of our leading literary critics, when it was issued in\r\nthis country. “It is a grand conception, this of the great physiologist,\r\nthat every man, in the brief term of his prenatal development, should go\r\nthrough these successive changes, by which man has, in countless ages,\r\nbeen evolved from the primitive germ-cell; and it is triumphantly\r\nvindicated in _The Evolution of Man_. It is impossible to do justice in\r\nwords to the patience, the labour, the specialised skill and industry\r\ninvolved in the preparation of this monumental work.” And one has only\r\nto compare this latest edition with the previous one to see at a glance\r\nthe complete transformation, and realise the freshness and force of mind\r\nof the aged biologist.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such a work, with its towering structure of proof from\r\nembryology, comparative anatomy, and paleontology, one must look\r\nleniently on some of Haeckel’s references to fellow-anthropologists like\r\nVirchow. It is not many years since the great pathologist declared\r\nemphatically at a scientific congress that “we could just as well\r\nconceive man to have descended from a sheep or an elephant as from an\r\nape.” When a leading anthropologist could say such things in 1894, a\r\nstrain is laid on our charity. Darwin’s words, written in a letter to\r\nHaeckel, press on us once more: “Virchow’s conduct is shameful, and I\r\ntrust he will one day feel the shame of it.” Professor Rabl has lately\r\ncontended that his deceased father-in-law (Virchow) admitted the\r\nevolution of man in private. We cannot wonder if Haeckel merely retorts:\r\n“So much the more shame on his public utterances.” Such things must, at\r\nleast, be borne in mind when one reads Haeckel’s severe judgment on some\r\nof his great contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe _Evolution of Man_ not only offers the complete proof of its\r\nthesis—a proof accepted by every prominent biologist in England and by\r\nmany prelates (such as the Bishop of London and the Dean of\r\nWestminster)—but affords also interesting proof of Haeckel’s artistic\r\ngifts. Some of the best plates in the work are executed by him. But in\r\nthe same year, 1903, he gave a more popular evidence of it. In detached\r\nnumbers he published the large and beautiful volume of his _Art-forms in\r\nNature_. In this work he depicts with remarkable success hundreds of the\r\nmost beautiful forms that his long study of marine life had brought\r\nbefore him. A fine expression of the man’s dual nature, the work appeals\r\nwith equal force to the æsthete and the scientist. And during the long\r\nhours that he was peering into his microscope and sketching the delicate\r\nand graceful forms, the din and roar of the mighty controversy he had\r\naroused was breaking in with every post. By the end of the year he had\r\nreceived more than 5,000 letters in connection with the _Riddle of the\r\nUniverse_. Scurrilous letters and idolatrous letters, sober letters and\r\nfantastic letters, flowed upon the Zoological Institute, where he worked\r\nwith pen and pencil, and were duly read. He merely defended himself by\r\nposting to each correspondent a printed form that he would soon issue a\r\nnew work in which the further questions would be answered. He had given\r\nhis life to science and humanity, and would not withdraw for the\r\nwell-earned rest. And from a thousand pulpits over Europe and America\r\nthe aged and self-sacrificing worker was being denounced and caricatured\r\nto audiences who had not the remotest knowledge of his aims and his\r\nwork. A friend of mine heard a minister in an important Glasgow church\r\nassure his congregation from the pulpit that “Haeckel was a man of\r\nnotoriously licentious life;” he had heard it “from a friend of\r\nHaeckel’s.” At the very time when Haeckel was buried in his splendid\r\nartistic work, the _Christian World Pulpit_ was issuing a sermon in\r\nwhich Dr. Horton was explaining “the personal factor” in Haeckel. “He is\r\nan atrophied soul, a being that is blind on the spiritual side,” the\r\npopular preacher declared.\r\n\r\nFrom the turmoil Haeckel withdrew once more to his beloved Italy. There\r\nwas another reason for his flight. His seventieth birthday was\r\napproaching. He had declared at the banquet given in his honour on the\r\noccasion of his sixtieth birthday, that if he lived for the seventieth\r\nhe would “bury himself in some dark corner of the Thuringian forest, far\r\naway from all festivities.” Strenuous and exacting as the ten years had\r\nbeen, he now found himself on the threshold of his eighth decade of\r\nlife. His wife, also, was ailing, and they both proceeded to the Italian\r\nRiviera at the beginning of the winter. Few of his friends were informed\r\nwhere he was. “I want,” he wrote to me, “to pass my seventieth birthday\r\nin peace.” He settled at Rapallo, and at once commenced his favourite\r\nfishing for the tiny inhabitants of the Mediterranean. The “cloistral\r\nquietness” of the little town, the daily prospect of the blue\r\nMediterranean, “the solitary walks in the wild gorges of the Ligurian\r\nApennines, and the uplifting sight of their forest-crowned\r\nmountain-altars” restored his freshness of spirit. Once more a vast\r\nlabour lay before him. He had promised a work that would answer all\r\nbiological questions addressed to him in the 5,000 letters of his\r\ncorrespondents. He had all the queries, all the criticisms of his views,\r\nall the latest literature of the subject, to digest into a compact\r\nvolume. The result was a new work of 557 pages, _The Wonders of Life_, a\r\nremarkable summary of his zoological and botanical knowledge, with\r\nexcursions into psychology, suicide, lunacy, ethnography, theology, and\r\nethics. Its twenty solid and well-arranged chapters were written in four\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n“Promptly at 5,” he wrote in December, “I am awakened by the bells of\r\nthe church hard by. I write continuously until 12. After a frugal lunch\r\nand a short rest, the afternoon is devoted to a walk or to water-colour\r\nsketches. The longer days allow me to sit and paint in the open air\r\nuntil five. Our quiet evenings, from 5 to 10, are spent in reading and\r\nin writing letters. The interruption for dinner, from 7 to 8, gives us\r\nan opportunity to exchange jokes over our ‘cloistral life.’” Thus the\r\nveteran naturalist, of “notoriously licentious life” (the words of the\r\nGlasgow preacher were spoken at this very period), approached his eighth\r\ndecade of life—of work.\r\n\r\nHe remained at Rapallo until the birthday had passed, but his address\r\nhad meantime become widely known, and the miniature postal arrangements\r\nat Rapallo were severely taxed. Letters, telegrams, flowers, and other\r\ngifts—mostly spontaneous expressions of gratitude from “unknown readers\r\nof the _Riddle of the Universe_“—reminded him of the larger world that\r\nnow appreciated him. A still larger number of letters and gifts reached\r\nJena from all parts of the world. Hundreds of German journals and\r\nperiodicals devoted long and generous articles to the distinguished\r\nworker, and little festive commemorations were held at many of the\r\nuniversities. At Zurich, Professor Conrad Keller and Professor Arnold\r\nLang delivered speeches which have since been published. Jena sent a\r\ndeputation consisting of a number of its professors to visit the hero in\r\nperson at Rapallo. Reflecting on these remarkable demonstrations and the\r\nextraordinary correspondence that continually reaches Haeckel, one is\r\ndisposed to repeat of him the phrase applied to a great heretical\r\nteacher of the Middle Ages, Peter Abélard: “Never was man so loved—and\r\nso hated.”\r\n\r\nA feature of the commemoration that peculiarly gratified him was the\r\nspecial festive number of the German students’ lively periodical,\r\n_Jugend_, published at Munich. On February 16th it appeared as a\r\n“Haeckel number,” full of sprightly anecdote and generous appreciation,\r\nand bearing on its cover a striking reproduction in colour of the\r\nLenbach portrait. His letter of thanks to the journal shows that the\r\nrepose and the beauty of Italy, and the outburst of affection his\r\nbirthday has provoked, have set him perfectly atune to life once more.\r\n“Ah! Prithee stay, thou art so fair,” he almost says in the Goethe\r\nphrase, as he “hails the moment fleeing.” He goes on to deprecate the\r\neffort to make “a learned man” of him. “That, alas, I am not. We have in\r\nGermany many professors and teachers who are more learned, and have read\r\nfar more books than your poor Jena schoolmaster. But from my earliest\r\nyouth, since I tore up flowers and admired butterflies in my fourth\r\nyear, I have yielded to the inclination of my heart and studied\r\nincessantly one great book—Nature. This greatest of all books has taught\r\nme to know the true God, the God of Spinoza and Goethe. Then as\r\nphysician I saw human life in all its heights and depths, and in my many\r\ntravels through half the globe I learned the inexhaustible splendour of\r\nthe earth. And I have honestly tried with all my modest powers, to\r\nreproduce with pen and pencil a part of what I saw, and reveal it to my\r\nfellows. I have had to fight many a hard fight, and in my hatred of lies\r\nand hypocrisy and decaying traditions I have at times struck a sharp\r\nnote. But I trust, dear _Youth_, that thou wilt not judge all that\r\nharshly in so old and storm-tried, a warrior, and that thou wilt go on\r\nto stand with me, shoulder to shoulder, fighting for the spiritual\r\nprogress of humanity, fighting in the cause of the great trinity of the\r\ntrue, the good, and the beautiful.”\r\n\r\nThe work he had composed in four months at Rapallo, _The Wonders of\r\nLife_, was issued on his return. It has not had the stormy success of\r\nits predecessor. The fact is instructive. This work contains a fuller\r\nproof of the chief scientific positions of the _Riddle_. It is,\r\ntherefore, more technical and more difficult to read. Amongst other\r\nmatters, it contains a fine summary of those speculations on the\r\nmathematical forms of organisms and the idea of individuality of which\r\nProfessor Bölsche has written so appreciatively. It must be recognised\r\nthat Haeckel has fulfilled a duty in thus providing the general reader\r\nwith a fuller biological proof of his theses. If that estimable person,\r\nthe general reader, betrays less eagerness for the fuller proof, we must\r\nremember that for ages he has been taught to disregard such a thing as\r\n“proof.” It is the general reader that makes Haeckel didactic. It is\r\nHaeckel’s opponents who made the general reader. However, the great bulk\r\nof _The Wonders of Life_ is true to its title. It is an intensely\r\ninteresting summary of biological facts. For the rest, if it contains\r\nspeculations that run beyond the evidence (though based on it) who is\r\nbetter qualified to open up these new paths than men with the enormous\r\nrange of knowledge that Haeckel has? “I agree with you,” one of the\r\nfirst biologists in England wrote to me recently, “that Haeckel is one\r\nof the first living biologists. There are not any others who have the\r\nsame wide knowledge and experience and consequent ‘point of view.’ He\r\nknows his zoology, botany, physiology, and pathology, also geology, and\r\nhas travelled, and has a keen interest in and knowledge of no small\r\ndegree of philology, archæology, and ethnography.”\r\n\r\nHaeckel was in Italy once more in the autumn of 1904, and although he\r\ndid little quiet travel and no fishing for radiolaria it is probable\r\nthat no visit to the country ever afforded him such satisfaction. One\r\ngreat shadow lay over the beautiful land and its genial race whenever he\r\nvisited it—a gross and almost impenetrable superstition. Turn off the\r\ngreat routes of Italy, with their splendid cathedrals, and visit the\r\nsmall towns and villages. See the scum of Naples tearing the clothes\r\nfrom each other to kiss the “blood of St. Januarius.” Peer into the\r\nabysses of vice and grossness that are covered effectually by this\r\nformal and unlovely practice of religion. Haeckel had seen all that with\r\nsad eyes for many a year.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 a little institution that called itself “The International\r\nCongress of Freethinkers” announced that it would hold its annual\r\ngathering at Rome. The pope—the new pope, friend of the royal\r\nhouse—lodged a feeling protest with the authorities. The priests poured\r\ninflammatory rhetoric over their people until violence seemed\r\ninevitable. The Italian Government’s only reply was to grant the\r\nheretics all the privileges that were ever given to the great Catholic\r\npilgrimages: to put at their disposal its finest institution, the\r\nCollegio Romano, and to send its Minister of Public Instruction to open\r\nthe Congress. Veteran warriors such as Haeckel, Berthelot, Salmeron,\r\nSergi, Denis, and Björnsen, gladly announced their adhesion. Paris sent\r\na thousand delegates; Spain nearly a thousand; Italy her thousands.\r\nWhole municipalities in Italy and France (even that of Paris) took part.\r\nThe Latin world was aflame with rebellion. We met, seven thousand\r\nstrong, in the heart of Rome, and Rome—the jade—smiled prettily as we\r\nmarched up the Via Venti Settembre, as it had smiled once on processions\r\nof Cybele, and then on processions of Catholics.\r\n\r\nHaeckel was greeted with a wild demonstration as he stepped on to the\r\nplatform in the great _Cortile_ of the College. Straight and proud,\r\nwhite with age but pink with more than the freshness of a young man, he\r\nadjured them in futile German, in his thin, inaudible voice, to form\r\nthemselves into a new Church, the great Association of Monists. Few\r\nheard and less understood him, but his name was on every heart and his\r\nreception superb.\r\n\r\nA week afterwards I picked up a London journal in an Italian hotel, and\r\nread—as hundreds of thousands had done—that a miserable Freethought\r\nconference had been held at Rome: that its rowdy proceedings had\r\ndisgusted the scholars who had, in a misguided moment, lent their names\r\nto it. Thus are we informed at times. I remembered Sergi’s enthusiastic\r\ncomments at the close. “E magnifico, e magnifico,” was all he could\r\ngasp. I remembered Haeckel’s exultation as we walked home to his Albergo\r\nSanta Chiara, and Berthelot’s deep joy. The same scholars, except\r\nBjörnsen, took part in the Congress at Paris, in 1905, when 100,000 of\r\nus were nobly received by the Conseil Municipal. But Haeckel was too\r\nunwell to come. Nature has laid her hand on him at length, and bade him\r\nhang his weapons on the wall. He can but hope to remain a passive\r\nspectator for a few years more of that vast stirring of the Latin\r\npeoples which he has so much contributed to bring about.\r\n\r\nHis last active effort was the delivery of three lectures at Berlin in\r\nthe spring of 1905. He has always avoided public lectures as much as\r\npossible. His poor voice and comparative nervousness make the work\r\nunattractive. A severe attack of influenza sapped his strength in the\r\nwinter of 1905, and he has been unable to eliminate its unpleasant\r\nconsequences. But the opportunity of enforcing his gospel in the capital\r\nof the Empire, where the Virchows and Du Bois-Reymonds had ruled so long\r\nmade him deaf to the counsels of prudence. He chose as his theme the\r\ncontroversy in regard to evolution, and gave three spirited lectures.\r\nThe changed world came home to him vividly enough. A vast and\r\nenthusiastic gathering of admirers in one of the finest halls in Berlin:\r\noutside, at the very door, his clerical opponents distributing handbills\r\nthat offered a choice selection of the most venemous attacks on his\r\nperson and work. The lectures are now available in English under the\r\ntitle of _Last Words on Evolution_.\r\n\r\nThe present state of Haeckel’s health forbids him to hope that he will\r\ndo any more active work. As I write, he lies in his villa, in “Haeckel\r\nStreet,” overlooking the handsome Zoological Institute, which he raised,\r\nand the little university town that he has made known to the world.\r\nBeyond the graceful hills that cradle it, he sees the dark waves tossing\r\nthat he has worked so hard to set in motion. In Germany the alliance of\r\nthe Emperor with the Catholics saddens him, but—the Jesuits are\r\naccepting evolution, over the fresh grave of Virchow. Abroad his ideals,\r\neven his ideas, are making triumphant progress. He thinks of the vast\r\nchanges that have taken place since he stood out, almost alone, reckless\r\nof all but honour and truth, at the Stettin Congress in 1863. “Das Leben\r\nist schön,” he still repeats. What will men say of _him_ when the lines\r\nof history draw in, and the critic will have the proper perspective? I\r\nbelieve no great worker ever thought less about it. Through inexorable\r\nlabour, through constant sacrifice, through storms of painful obloquy,\r\nhe has lived his ideals, if he has made mistakes—been mortal. Those\r\nideals are an enduring contribution to the good. The first, the motto of\r\nhis young days, was _Impavidi progrediamur_—“Let us march on\r\nfearlessly.” The second, the motto of his later years, was: “The good,\r\nthe true, and the beautiful, are the ideals, yea the gods, of our\r\nMonistic philosophy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Bibliography\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the works by Professor Haeckel that have been\r\ntranslated into English:—\r\n\r\n“The History of Creation.” Translation (in two vols., edited by E.\r\nRay-Lankester) of the _Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte_. 1876.
