KROPOTKIN\r\n\r\n1902\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo aspects of animal life impressed me most during the journeys which I\r\nmade in my youth in Eastern Siberia and Northern Manchuria. One of them\r\nwas the extreme severity of the struggle for existence which most\r\nspecies of animals have to carry on against an inclement Nature; the\r\nenormous destruction of life which periodically results from natural\r\nagencies; and the consequent paucity of life over the vast territory\r\nwhich fell under my observation. And the other was, that even in those\r\nfew spots where animal life teemed in abundance, I failed to\r\nfind--although I was eagerly looking for it--that bitter struggle for\r\nthe means of existence, among animals belonging to the same species,\r\nwhich was considered by most Darwinists (though not always by Darwin\r\nhimself) as the dominant characteristic of struggle for life, and the\r\nmain factor of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe terrible snow-storms which sweep over the northern portion of\r\nEurasia in the later part of the winter, and the glazed frost that often\r\nfollows them; the frosts and the snow-storms which return every year in\r\nthe second half of May, when the trees are already in full blossom and\r\ninsect life swarms everywhere; the early frosts and, occasionally, the\r\nheavy snowfalls in July and August, which suddenly destroy myriads of\r\ninsects, as well as the second broods of the birds in the prairies; the\r\ntorrential rains, due to the monsoons, which fall in more temperate\r\nregions in August and September--resulting in inundations on a scale\r\nwhich is only known in America and in Eastern Asia, and swamping, on the\r\nplateaus, areas as wide as European States; and finally, the heavy\r\nsnowfalls, early in October, which eventually render a territory as\r\nlarge as France and Germany, absolutely impracticable for ruminants, and\r\ndestroy them by the thousand--these were the conditions under which I\r\nsaw animal life struggling in Northern Asia. They made me realize at an\r\nearly date the overwhelming importance in Nature of what Darwin\r\ndescribed as \"the natural checks to over-multiplication,\" in comparison\r\nto the struggle between individuals of the same species for the means of\r\nsubsistence, which may go on here and there, to some limited extent, but\r\nnever attains the importance of the former. Paucity of life,\r\nunder-population--not over-population--being the distinctive feature of\r\nthat immense part of the globe which we name Northern Asia, I conceived\r\nsince then serious doubts--which subsequent study has only confirmed--as\r\nto the reality of that fearful competition for food and life within each\r\nspecies, which was an article of faith with most Darwinists, and,\r\nconsequently, as to the dominant part which this sort of competition was\r\nsupposed to play in the evolution of new species.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, wherever I saw animal life in abundance, as, for\r\ninstance, on the lakes where scores of species and millions of\r\nindividuals came together to rear their progeny; in the colonies of\r\nrodents; in the migrations of birds which took place at that time on a\r\ntruly American scale along the Usuri; and especially in a migration of\r\nfallow-deer which I witnessed on the Amur, and during which scores of\r\nthousands of these intelligent animals came together from an immense\r\nterritory, flying before the coming deep snow, in order to cross the\r\nAmur where it is narrowest--in all these scenes of animal life which\r\npassed before my eyes, I saw Mutual Aid and Mutual Support carried on to\r\nan extent which made me suspect in it a feature of the greatest\r\nimportance for the maintenance of life, the preservation of each\r\nspecies, and its further evolution.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, I saw among the semi-wild cattle and horses in\r\nTransbaikalia, among the wild ruminants everywhere, the squirrels, and\r\nso on, that when animals have to struggle against scarcity of food, in\r\nconsequence of one of the above-mentioned causes, the whole of that\r\nportion of the species which is affected by the calamity, comes out of\r\nthe ordeal so much impoverished in vigour and health, that no\r\nprogressive evolution of the species can be based upon such periods of\r\nkeen competition.\r\n\r\nConsequently, when my attention was drawn, later on, to the relations\r\nbetween Darwinism and Sociology, I could agree with none of the works\r\nand pamphlets that had been written upon this important subject. They\r\nall endeavoured to prove that Man, owing to his higher intelligence and\r\nknowledge, may mitigate the harshness of the struggle for life between\r\nmen; but they all recognized at the same time that the struggle for the\r\nmeans of existence, of every animal against all its congeners, and of\r\nevery man against all other men, was \"a law of Nature.\" This view,\r\nhowever, I could not accept, because I was persuaded that to admit a\r\npitiless inner war for life within each species, and to see in that war\r\na condition of progress, was to admit something which not only had not\r\nyet been proved, but also lacked confirmation from direct observation.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, a lecture \"On the Law of Mutual Aid,\" which was\r\ndelivered at a Russian Congress of Naturalists, in January 1880, by the\r\nwell-known zoologist, Professor Kessler, the then Dean of the St.\r\nPetersburg University, struck me as throwing a new light on the whole\r\nsubject. Kessler's idea was, that besides the law of Mutual Struggle\r\nthere is in Nature the law of Mutual Aid, which, for the success of the\r\nstruggle for life, and especially for the progressive evolution of the\r\nspecies, is far more important than the law of mutual contest. This\r\nsuggestion--which was, in reality, nothing but a further development of\r\nthe ideas expressed by Darwin himself in The Descent of Man--seemed to\r\nme so correct and of so great an importance, that since I became\r\nacquainted with it (in 1883) I began to collect materials for further\r\ndeveloping the idea, which Kessler had only cursorily sketched in his\r\nlecture, but had not lived to develop. He died in 1881.\r\n\r\nIn one point only I could not entirely endorse Kessler's views. Kessler\r\nalluded to \"parental feeling\" and care for progeny (see below, Chapter\r\nI) as to the source of mutual inclinations in animals. However, to\r\ndetermine how far these two feelings have really been at work in the\r\nevolution of sociable instincts, and how far other instincts have been\r\nat work in the same direction, seems to me a quite distinct and a very\r\nwide question, which we hardly can discuss yet. It will be only after we\r\nhave well established the facts of mutual aid in different classes of\r\nanimals, and their importance for evolution, that we shall be able to\r\nstudy what belongs in the evolution of sociable feelings, to parental\r\nfeelings, and what to sociability proper--the latter having evidently\r\nits origin at the earliest stages of the evolution of the animal world,\r\nperhaps even at the \"colony-stages.\" I consequently directed my chief\r\nattention to establishing first of all, the importance of the Mutual Aid\r\nfactor of evolution, leaving to ulterior research the task of\r\ndiscovering the origin of the Mutual Aid instinct in Nature.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the Mutual Aid factor--\"if its generality could only\r\nbe demonstrated\"--did not escape the naturalist's genius so manifest in\r\nGoethe. When Eckermann told once to Goethe--it was in 1827--that two\r\nlittle wren-fledglings, which had run away from him, were found by him\r\nnext day in the nest of robin redbreasts (Rothkehlchen), which fed the\r\nlittle ones, together with their own youngsters, Goethe grew quite\r\nexcited about this fact. He saw in it a confirmation of his pantheistic\r\nviews, and said:--\"If it be true that this feeding of a stranger goes\r\nthrough all Nature as something having the character of a general\r\nlaw--then many an enigma would be solved.\" He returned to this matter on\r\nthe next day, and most earnestly entreated Eckermann (who was, as is\r\nknown, a zoologist) to make a special study of the subject, adding that\r\nhe would surely come \"to quite invaluable treasuries of results\"\r\n(Gespräche, edition of 1848, vol. iii. pp. 219, 221). Unfortunately,\r\nthis study was never made, although it is very possible that Brehm, who\r\nhas accumulated in his works such rich materials relative to mutual aid\r\namong animals, might have been inspired by Goethe's remark.\r\n\r\nSeveral works of importance were published in the years 1872-1886,\r\ndealing with the intelligence and the mental life of animals (they are\r\nmentioned in a footnote in Chapter I of this book), and three of them\r\ndealt more especially with the subject under consideration; namely, Les\r\nSocietes animales, by Espinas (Paris, 1877); La Lutte pour l'existence\r\net l'association pout la lutte, a lecture by J.L. Lanessan (April 1881);\r\nand Louis Buchner's book, Liebe und Liebes-Leben in der Thierwelt, of\r\nwhich the first edition appeared in 1882 or 1883, and a second, much\r\nenlarged, in 1885. But excellent though each of these works is, they\r\nleave ample room for a work in which Mutual Aid would be considered, not\r\nonly as an argument in favour of a pre-human origin of moral instincts,\r\nbut also as a law of Nature and a factor of evolution. Espinas devoted\r\nhis main attention to such animal societies (ants, bees) as are\r\nestablished upon a physiological division of labour, and though his work\r\nis full of admirable hints in all possible directions, it was written at\r\na time when the evolution of human societies could not yet be treated\r\nwith the knowledge we now possess. Lanessan's lecture has more the\r\ncharacter of a brilliantly laid-out general plan of a work, in which\r\nmutual support would be dealt with, beginning with rocks in the sea, and\r\nthen passing in review the world of plants, of animals and men. As to\r\nBuchner's work, suggestive though it is and rich in facts, I could not\r\nagree with its leading idea. The book begins with a hymn to Love, and\r\nnearly all its illustrations are intended to prove the existence of love\r\nand sympathy among animals. However, to reduce animal sociability to\r\nlove and sympathy means to reduce its generality and its importance,\r\njust as human ethics based upon love and personal sympathy only have\r\ncontributed to narrow the comprehension of the moral feeling as a whole.\r\nIt is not love to my neighbour--whom I often do not know at all--which\r\ninduces me to seize a pail of water and to rush towards his house when I\r\nsee it on fire; it is a far wider, even though more vague feeling or\r\ninstinct of human solidarity and sociability which moves me. So it is\r\nalso with animals. It is not love, and not even sympathy (understood in\r\nits proper sense) which induces a herd of ruminants or of horses to form\r\na ring in order to resist an attack of wolves; not love which induces\r\nwolves to form a pack for hunting; not love which induces kittens or\r\nlambs to play, or a dozen of species of young birds to spend their days\r\ntogether in the autumn; and it is neither love nor personal sympathy\r\nwhich induces many thousand fallow-deer scattered over a territory as\r\nlarge as France to form into a score of separate herds, all marching\r\ntowards a given spot, in order to cross there a river. It is a feeling\r\ninfinitely wider than love or personal sympathy--an instinct that has\r\nbeen slowly developed among animals and men in the course of an\r\nextremely long evolution, and which has taught animals and men alike the\r\nforce they can borrow from the practice of mutual aid and support, and\r\nthe joys they can find in social life.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this distinction will be easily appreciated by the\r\nstudent of animal psychology, and the more so by the student of human\r\nethics. Love, sympathy and self-sacrifice certainly play an immense part\r\nin the progressive development of our moral feelings. But it is not love\r\nand not even sympathy upon which Society is based in mankind. It is the\r\nconscience--be it only at the stage of an instinct--of human solidarity.\r\nIt is the unconscious recognition of the force that is borrowed by each\r\nman from the practice of mutual aid; of the close dependency of every\r\none's happiness upon the happiness of all; and of the sense of justice,\r\nor equity, which brings the individual to consider the rights of every\r\nother individual as equal to his own. Upon this broad and necessary\r\nfoundation the still higher moral feelings are developed. But this\r\nsubject lies outside the scope of the present work, and I shall only\r\nindicate here a lecture, \"Justice and Morality\" which I delivered in\r\nreply to Huxley's Ethics, and in which the subject has been treated at\r\nsome length.\r\n\r\nConsequently I thought that a book, written on Mutual Aid as a Law of\r\nNature and a factor of evolution, might fill an important gap. When\r\nHuxley issued, in 1888, his \"Struggle-for-life\" manifesto (Struggle for\r\nExistence and its Bearing upon Man), which to my appreciation was a very\r\nincorrect representation of the facts of Nature, as one sees them in the\r\nbush and in the forest, I communicated with the editor of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury, asking him whether he would give the hospitality of his review\r\nto an elaborate reply to the views of one of the most prominent\r\nDarwinists; and Mr. James Knowles received the proposal with fullest\r\nsympathy. I also spoke of it to W. Bates. \"Yes, certainly; that is true\r\nDarwinism,\" was his reply. \"It is horrible what 'they' have made of\r\nDarwin. Write these articles, and when they are printed, I will write to\r\nyou a letter which you may publish.\" Unfortunately, it took me nearly\r\nseven years to write these articles, and when the last was published,\r\nBates was no longer living.\r\n\r\nAfter having discussed the importance of mutual aid in various classes\r\nof animals, I was evidently bound to discuss the importance of the same\r\nfactor in the evolution of Man. This was the more necessary as there are\r\na number of evolutionists who may not refuse to admit the importance of\r\nmutual aid among animals, but who, like Herbert Spencer, will refuse to\r\nadmit it for Man. For primitive Man--they maintain--war of each against\r\nall was the law of life. In how far this assertion, which has been too\r\nwillingly repeated, without sufficient criticism, since the times of\r\nHobbes, is supported by what we know about the early phases of human\r\ndevelopment, is discussed in the chapters given to the Savages and the\r\nBarbarians.\r\n\r\nThe number and importance of mutual-aid institutions which were\r\ndeveloped by the creative genius of the savage and half-savage masses,\r\nduring the earliest clan-period of mankind and still more during the\r\nnext village-community period, and the immense influence which these\r\nearly institutions have exercised upon the subsequent development of\r\nmankind, down to the present times, induced me to extend my researches\r\nto the later, historical periods as well; especially, to study that most\r\ninteresting period--the free medieval city republics, of which the\r\nuniversality and influence upon our modern civilization have not yet\r\nbeen duly appreciated. And finally, I have tried to indicate in brief\r\nthe immense importance which the mutual-support instincts, inherited by\r\nmankind from its extremely long evolution, play even now in our modern\r\nsociety, which is supposed to rest upon the principle: \"every one for\r\nhimself, and the State for all,\" but which it never has succeeded, nor\r\nwill succeed in realizing.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected to this book that both animals and men are\r\nrepresented in it under too favourable an aspect; that their sociable\r\nqualities are insisted upon, while their anti-social and self-asserting\r\ninstincts are hardly touched upon. This was, however, unavoidable. We\r\nhave heard so much lately of the \"harsh, pitiless struggle for life,\"\r\nwhich was said to be carried on by every animal against all other\r\nanimals, every \"savage\" against all other \"savages,\" and every civilized\r\nman against all his co-citizens--and these assertions have so much\r\nbecome an article of faith--that it was necessary, first of all, to\r\noppose to them a wide series of facts showing animal and human life\r\nunder a quite different aspect. It was necessary to indicate the\r\noverwhelming importance which sociable habits play in Nature and in the\r\nprogressive evolution of both the animal species and human beings: to\r\nprove that they secure to animals a better protection from their\r\nenemies, very often facilities for getting food and (winter provisions,\r\nmigrations, etc.), longevity, therefore a greater facility for the\r\ndevelopment of intellectual faculties; and that they have given to men,\r\nin addition to the same advantages, the possibility of working out those\r\ninstitutions which have enabled mankind to survive in its hard struggle\r\nagainst Nature, and to progress, notwithstanding all the vicissitudes of\r\nits history. It is a book on the law of Mutual Aid, viewed at as one of\r\nthe chief factors of evolution--not on all factors of evolution and\r\ntheir respective values; and this first book had to be written, before\r\nthe latter could become possible.\r\n\r\nI should certainly be the last to underrate the part which the\r\nself-assertion of the individual has played in the evolution of mankind.\r\nHowever, this subject requires, I believe, a much deeper treatment than\r\nthe one it has hitherto received. In the history of mankind, individual\r\nself-assertion has often been, and continually is, something quite\r\ndifferent from, and far larger and deeper than, the petty, unintelligent\r\nnarrow-mindedness, which, with a large class of writers, goes for\r\n\"individualism\" and \"self-assertion.\" Nor have history-making\r\nindividuals been limited to those whom historians have represented as\r\nheroes. My intention, consequently, is, if circumstances permit it, to\r\ndiscuss separately the part taken by the self-assertion of the\r\nindividual in the progressive evolution of mankind. I can only make in\r\nthis place the following general remark:--When the Mutual Aid\r\ninstitutions--the tribe, the village community, the guilds, the medieval\r\ncity--began, in the course of history, to lose their primitive\r\ncharacter, to be invaded by parasitic growths, and thus to become\r\nhindrances to progress, the revolt of individuals against these\r\ninstitutions took always two different aspects. Part of those who rose\r\nup strove to purify the old institutions, or to work out a higher form\r\nof commonwealth, based upon the same Mutual Aid principles; they tried,\r\nfor instance, to introduce the principle of \"compensation,\" instead of\r\nthe lex talionis, and later on, the pardon of offences, or a still\r\nhigher ideal of equality before the human conscience, in lieu of\r\n\"compensation,\" according to class-value. But at the very same time,\r\nanother portion of the same individual rebels endeavoured to break down\r\nthe protective institutions of mutual support, with no other intention\r\nbut to increase their own wealth and their own powers. In this\r\nthree-cornered contest, between the two classes of revolted individuals\r\nand the supporters of what existed, lies the real tragedy of history.\r\nBut to delineate that contest, and honestly to study the part played in\r\nthe evolution of mankind by each one of these three forces, would\r\nrequire at least as many years as it took me to write this book.\r\n\r\nOf works dealing with nearly the same subject, which have been published\r\nsince the publication of my articles on Mutual Aid among Animals, I must\r\nmention The Lowell Lectures on the Ascent of Man, by Henry Drummond\r\n(London, 1894), and The Origin and Growth of the Moral Instinct, by A.\r\nSutherland (London, 1898). Both are constructed chiefly on the lines\r\ntaken in Buchner's Love, and in the second work the parental and\r\nfamilial feeling as the sole influence at work in the development of the\r\nmoral feelings has been dealt with at some length. A third work dealing\r\nwith man and written on similar lines is The Principles of Sociology, by\r\nProf. F.A. Giddings, the first edition of which was published in 1896 at\r\nNew York and London, and the leading ideas of which were sketched by the\r\nauthor in a pamphlet in 1894. I must leave, however, to literary critics\r\nthe task of discussing the points of contact, resemblance, or divergence\r\nbetween these works and mine.\r\n\r\nThe different chapters of this book were published first in the\r\nNineteenth Century (\"Mutual Aid among Animals,\" in September and\r\nNovember 1890; \"Mutual Aid among Savages,\" in April 1891; \"Mutual Aid\r\namong the Barbarians,\" in January 1892; \"Mutual Aid in the Medieval\r\nCity,\" in August and September 1894; and \"Mutual Aid amongst Modern\r\nMen,\" in January and June 1896). In bringing them out in a book form my\r\nfirst intention was to embody in an Appendix the mass of materials, as\r\nwell as the discussion of several secondary points, which had to be\r\nomitted in the review articles. It appeared, however, that the Appendix\r\nwould double the size of the book, and I was compelled to abandon, or,\r\nat least, to postpone its publication. The present Appendix includes the\r\ndiscussion of only a few points which have been the matter of scientific\r\ncontroversy during the last few years; and into the text I have\r\nintroduced only such matter as could be introduced without altering the\r\nstructure of the work.\r\n\r\nI am glad of this opportunity for expressing to the editor of the\r\nNineteenth Century, Mr. James Knowles, my very best thanks, both for the\r\nkind hospitality which he offered to these papers in his review, as soon\r\nas he knew their general idea, and the permission he kindly gave me to\r\nreprint them.\r\n\r\nBromley, Kent, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMUTUAL AID AMONG ANIMALS\r\n\r\nStruggle for existence. Mutual Aid a law of Nature and chief factor of\r\nprogressive evolution. Invertebrates. Ants and Bees. Birds, hunting and\r\nfishing associations. Sociability. Mutual protection among small birds.\r\nCranes, parrots.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conception of struggle for existence as a factor of evolution,\r\nintroduced into science by Darwin and Wallace, has permitted us to\r\nembrace an immensely wide range of phenomena in one single\r\ngeneralization, which soon became the very basis of our philosophical,\r\nbiological, and sociological speculations. An immense variety of\r\nfacts:--adaptations of function and structure of organic beings to their\r\nsurroundings; physiological and anatomical evolution; intellectual\r\nprogress, and moral development itself, which we formerly used to\r\nexplain by so many different causes, were embodied by Darwin in one\r\ngeneral conception. We understood them as continued endeavours--as a\r\nstruggle against adverse circumstances--for such a development of\r\nindividuals, races, species and societies, as would result in the\r\ngreatest possible fulness, variety, and intensity of life. It may be\r\nthat at the outset Darwin himself was not fully aware of the generality\r\nof the factor which he first invoked for explaining one series only of\r\nfacts relative to the accumulation of individual variations in incipient\r\nspecies. But he foresaw that the term which he was introducing into\r\nscience would lose its philosophical and its only true meaning if it\r\nwere to be used in its narrow sense only--that of a struggle between\r\nseparate individuals for the sheer means of existence. And at the very\r\nbeginning of his memorable work he insisted upon the term being taken in\r\nits \"large and metaphorical sense including dependence of one being on\r\nanother, and including (which is more important) not only the life of\r\nthe individual, but success in leaving progeny.\"(1)\r\n\r\nWhile he himself was chiefly using the term in its narrow sense for his\r\nown special purpose, he warned his followers against committing the\r\nerror (which he seems once to have committed himself) of overrating its\r\nnarrow meaning. In The Descent of Man he gave some powerful pages to\r\nillustrate its proper, wide sense. He pointed out how, in numberless\r\nanimal societies, the struggle between separate individuals for the\r\nmeans of existence disappears, how struggle is replaced by co-operation,\r\nand how that substitution results in the development of intellectual and\r\nmoral faculties which secure to the species the best conditions for\r\nsurvival. He intimated that in such cases the fittest are not the\r\nphysically strongest, nor the cunningest, but those who learn to combine\r\nso as mutually to support each other, strong and weak alike, for the\r\nwelfare of the community. \"Those communities,\" he wrote, \"which included\r\nthe greatest number of the most sympathetic members would flourish best,\r\nand rear the greatest number of offspring\" (2nd edit., p. 163). The\r\nterm, which originated from the narrow Malthusian conception of\r\ncompetition between each and all, thus lost its narrowness in the mind\r\nof one who knew Nature.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, these remarks, which might have become the basis of most\r\nfruitful researches, were overshadowed by the masses of facts gathered\r\nfor the purpose of illustrating the consequences of a real competition\r\nfor life. Besides, Darwin never attempted to submit to a closer\r\ninvestigation the relative importance of the two aspects under which the\r\nstruggle for existence appears in the animal world, and he never wrote\r\nthe work he proposed to write upon the natural checks to\r\nover-multiplication, although that work would have been the crucial test\r\nfor appreciating the real purport of individual struggle. Nay, on the\r\nvery pages just mentioned, amidst data disproving the narrow Malthusian\r\nconception of struggle, the old Malthusian leaven reappeared--namely, in\r\nDarwin's remarks as to the alleged inconveniences of maintaining the\r\n\"weak in mind and body\" in our civilized societies (ch. v). As if\r\nthousands of weak-bodied and infirm poets, scientists, inventors, and\r\nreformers, together with other thousands of so-called \"fools\" and\r\n\"weak-minded enthusiasts,\" were not the most precious weapons used by\r\nhumanity in its struggle for existence by intellectual and moral arms,\r\nwhich Darwin himself emphasized in those same chapters of Descent of\r\nMan.\r\n\r\nIt happened with Darwin's theory as it always happens with theories\r\nhaving any bearing upon human relations. Instead of widening it\r\naccording to his own hints, his followers narrowed it still more. And\r\nwhile Herbert Spencer, starting on independent but closely allied lines,\r\nattempted to widen the inquiry into that great question, \"Who are the\r\nfittest?\" especially in the appendix to the third edition of the Data of\r\nEthics, the numberless followers of Darwin reduced the notion of\r\nstruggle for existence to its narrowest limits. They came to conceive\r\nthe animal world as a world of perpetual struggle among half-starved\r\nindividuals, thirsting for one another's blood. They made modern\r\nliterature resound with the war-cry of woe to the vanquished, as if it\r\nwere the last word of modern biology. They raised the \"pitiless\"\r\nstruggle for personal advantages to the height of a biological principle\r\nwhich man must submit to as well, under the menace of otherwise\r\nsuccumbing in a world based upon mutual extermination. Leaving aside the\r\neconomists who know of natural science but a few words borrowed from\r\nsecond-hand vulgarizers, we must recognize that even the most authorized\r\nexponents of Darwin's views did their best to maintain those false\r\nideas. In fact, if we take Huxley, who certainly is considered as one of\r\nthe ablest exponents of the theory of evolution, were we not taught by\r\nhim, in a paper on the 'Struggle for Existence and its Bearing upon\r\nMan,' that,\r\n\r\n     \"from the point of view of the moralist, the animal world is on\r\n     about the same level as a gladiators' show. The creatures are\r\n     fairly well treated, and set to, fight hereby the strongest, the\r\n     swiftest, and the cunningest live to fight another day. The\r\n     spectator has no need to turn his thumb down, as no quarter is\r\n     given.\"\r\n\r\nOr, further down in the same article, did he not tell us that, as among\r\nanimals, so among primitive men,\r\n\r\n     \"the weakest and stupidest went to the wall, while the toughest and\r\n     shrewdest, those who were best fitted to cope with their\r\n     circumstances, but not the best in another way, survived. Life was\r\n     a continuous free fight, and beyond the limited and temporary\r\n     relations of the family, the Hobbesian war of each against all was\r\n     the normal state of existence.\"(2)\r\n\r\nIn how far this view of nature is supported by fact, will be seen from\r\nthe evidence which will be here submitted to the reader as regards the\r\nanimal world, and as regards primitive man. But it may be remarked at\r\nonce that Huxley's view of nature had as little claim to be taken as a\r\nscientific deduction as the opposite view of Rousseau, who saw in nature\r\nbut love, peace, and harmony destroyed by the accession of man. In fact,\r\nthe first walk in the forest, the first observation upon any animal\r\nsociety, or even the perusal of any serious work dealing with animal\r\nlife (D'Orbigny's, Audubon's, Le Vaillant's, no matter which), cannot\r\nbut set the naturalist thinking about the part taken by social life in\r\nthe life of animals, and prevent him from seeing in Nature nothing but a\r\nfield of slaughter, just as this would prevent him from seeing in Nature\r\nnothing but harmony and peace. Rousseau had committed the error of\r\nexcluding the beak-and-claw fight from his thoughts; and Huxley\r\ncommitted the opposite error; but neither Rousseau's optimism nor\r\nHuxley's pessimism can be accepted as an impartial interpretation of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we study animals--not in laboratories and museums only, but\r\nin the forest and the prairie, in the steppe and the mountains--we at\r\nonce perceive that though there is an immense amount of warfare and\r\nextermination going on amidst various species, and especially amidst\r\nvarious classes of animals, there is, at the same time, as much, or\r\nperhaps even more, of mutual support, mutual aid, and mutual defence\r\namidst animals belonging to the same species or, at least, to the same\r\nsociety. Sociability is as much a law of nature as mutual struggle. Of\r\ncourse it would be extremely difficult to estimate, however roughly, the\r\nrelative numerical importance of both these series of facts. But if we\r\nresort to an indirect test, and ask Nature: \"Who are the fittest: those\r\nwho are continually at war with each other, or those who support one\r\nanother?\" we at once see that those animals which acquire habits of\r\nmutual aid are undoubtedly the fittest. They have more chances to\r\nsurvive, and they attain, in their respective classes, the highest\r\ndevelopment of intelligence and bodily organization. If the numberless\r\nfacts which can be brought forward to support this view are taken into\r\naccount, we may safely say that mutual aid is as much a law of animal\r\nlife as mutual struggle, but that, as a factor of evolution, it most\r\nprobably has a far greater importance, inasmuch as it favours the\r\ndevelopment of such habits and characters as insure the maintenance and\r\nfurther development of the species, together with the greatest amount of\r\nwelfare and enjoyment of life for the individual, with the least waste\r\nof energy.\r\n\r\nOf the scientific followers of Darwin, the first, as far as I know, who\r\nunderstood the full purport of Mutual Aid as a law of Nature and the\r\nchief factor of evolution, was a well-known Russian zoologist, the late\r\nDean of the St. Petersburg University, Professor Kessler. He developed\r\nhis ideas in an address which he delivered in January 1880, a few months\r\nbefore his death, at a Congress of Russian naturalists; but, like so\r\nmany good things published in the Russian tongue only, that remarkable\r\naddress remains almost entirely unknown.(3)\r\n\r\n\"As a zoologist of old standing,\" he felt bound to protest against the\r\nabuse of a term--the struggle for existence--borrowed from zoology, or,\r\nat least, against overrating its importance. Zoology, he said, and those\r\nsciences which deal with man, continually insist upon what they call the\r\npitiless law of struggle for existence. But they forget the existence of\r\nanother law which may be described as the law of mutual aid, which law,\r\nat least for the animals, is far more essential than the former. He\r\npointed out how the need of leaving progeny necessarily brings animals\r\ntogether, and, \"the more the individuals keep together, the more they\r\nmutually support each other, and the more are the chances of the species\r\nfor surviving, as well as for making further progress in its\r\nintellectual development.\" \"All classes of animals,\" he continued, \"and\r\nespecially the higher ones, practise mutual aid,\" and he illustrated his\r\nidea by examples borrowed from the life of the burying beetles and the\r\nsocial life of birds and some mammalia. The examples were few, as might\r\nhave been expected in a short opening address, but the chief points were\r\nclearly stated; and, after mentioning that in the evolution of mankind\r\nmutual aid played a still more prominent part, Professor Kessler\r\nconcluded as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"I obviously do not deny the struggle for existence, but I maintain that\r\nthe progressive development of the animal kingdom, and especially of\r\nmankind, is favoured much more by mutual support than by mutual\r\nstruggle.... All organic beings have two essential needs: that of\r\nnutrition, and that of propagating the species. The former brings them\r\nto a struggle and to mutual extermination, while the needs of\r\nmaintaining the species bring them to approach one another and to\r\nsupport one another. But I am inclined to think that in the evolution of\r\nthe organic world--in the progressive modification of organic\r\nbeings--mutual support among individuals plays a much more important\r\npart than their mutual struggle.\"(4)\r\n\r\nThe correctness of the above views struck most of the Russian zoologists\r\npresent, and Syevertsoff, whose work is well known to ornithologists and\r\ngeographers, supported them and illustrated them by a few more examples.\r\nHe mentioned sone of the species of falcons which have \"an almost ideal\r\norganization for robbery,\" and nevertheless are in decay, while other\r\nspecies of falcons, which practise mutual help, do thrive. \"Take, on the\r\nother side, a sociable bird, the duck,\" he said; \"it is poorly organized\r\non the whole, but it practises mutual support, and it almost invades the\r\nearth, as may be judged from its numberless varieties and species.\"\r\n\r\nThe readiness of the Russian zoologists to accept Kessler's views seems\r\nquite natural, because nearly all of them have had opportunities of\r\nstudying the animal world in the wide uninhabited regions of Northern\r\nAsia and East Russia; and it is impossible to study like regions without\r\nbeing brought to the same ideas. I recollect myself the impression\r\nproduced upon me by the animal world of Siberia when I explored the\r\nVitim regions in the company of so accomplished a zoologist as my friend\r\nPolyakoff was. We both were under the fresh impression of the Origin of\r\nSpecies, but we vainly looked for the keen competition between animals\r\nof the same species which the reading of Darwin's work had prepared us\r\nto expect, even after taking into account the remarks of the third\r\nchapter (p. 54). We saw plenty of adaptations for struggling, very often\r\nin common, against the adverse circumstances of climate, or against\r\nvarious enemies, and Polyakoff wrote many a good page upon the mutual\r\ndependency of carnivores, ruminants, and rodents in their geographical\r\ndistribution; we witnessed numbers of facts of mutual support,\r\nespecially during the migrations of birds and ruminants; but even in the\r\nAmur and Usuri regions, where animal life swarms in abundance, facts of\r\nreal competition and struggle between higher animals of the same species\r\ncame very seldom under my notice, though I eagerly searched for them.\r\nThe same impression appears in the works of most Russian zoologists, and\r\nit probably explains why Kessler's ideas were so welcomed by the Russian\r\nDarwinists, whilst like ideas are not in vogue amidst the followers of\r\nDarwin in Western Europe.\r\n\r\nThe first thing which strikes us as soon as we begin studying the\r\nstruggle for existence under both its aspects--direct and\r\nmetaphorical--is the abundance of facts of mutual aid, not only for\r\nrearing progeny, as recognized by most evolutionists, but also for the\r\nsafety of the individual, and for providing it with the necessary food.\r\nWith many large divisions of the animal kingdom mutual aid is the rule.\r\nMutual aid is met with even amidst the lowest animals, and we must be\r\nprepared to learn some day, from the students of microscopical\r\npond-life, facts of unconscious mutual support, even from the life of\r\nmicro-organisms. Of course, our knowledge of the life of the\r\ninvertebrates, save the termites, the ants, and the bees, is extremely\r\nlimited; and yet, even as regards the lower animals, we may glean a few\r\nfacts of well-ascertained cooperation. The numberless associations of\r\nlocusts, vanessae, cicindelae, cicadae, and so on, are practically quite\r\nunexplored; but the very fact of their existence indicates that they\r\nmust be composed on about the same principles as the temporary\r\nassociations of ants or bees for purposes of migration. As to the\r\nbeetles, we have quite well-observed facts of mutual help amidst the\r\nburying beetles (Necrophorus). They must have some decaying organic\r\nmatter to lay their eggs in, and thus to provide their larvae with food;\r\nbut that matter must not decay very rapidly. So they are wont to bury in\r\nthe ground the corpses of all kinds of small animals which they\r\noccasionally find in their rambles. As a rule, they live an isolated\r\nlife, but when one of them has discovered the corpse of a mouse or of a\r\nbird, which it hardly could manage to bury itself, it calls four, six,\r\nor ten other beetles to perform the operation with united efforts; if\r\nnecessary, they transport the corpse to a suitable soft ground; and they\r\nbury it in a very considerate way, without quarrelling as to which of\r\nthem will enjoy the privilege of laying its eggs in the buried corpse.\r\nAnd when Gleditsch attached a dead bird to a cross made out of two\r\nsticks, or suspended a toad to a stick planted in the soil, the little\r\nbeetles would in the same friendly way combine their intelligences to\r\novercome the artifice of Man. The same combination of efforts has been\r\nnoticed among the dung-beetles.\r\n\r\nEven among animals standing at a somewhat lower stage of organization we\r\nmay find like examples. Some land-crabs of the West Indies and North\r\nAmerica combine in large swarms in order to travel to the sea and to\r\ndeposit therein their spawn; and each such migration implies concert,\r\nco-operation, and mutual support. As to the big Molucca crab (Limulus),\r\nI was struck (in 1882, at the Brighton Aquarium) with the extent of\r\nmutual assistance which these clumsy animals are capable of bestowing\r\nupon a comrade in case of need. One of them had fallen upon its back in\r\na corner of the tank, and its heavy saucepan-like carapace prevented it\r\nfrom returning to its natural position, the more so as there was in the\r\ncorner an iron bar which rendered the task still more difficult. Its\r\ncomrades came to the rescue, and for one hour's time I watched how they\r\nendeavoured to help their fellow-prisoner. They came two at once, pushed\r\ntheir friend from beneath, and after strenuous efforts succeeded in\r\nlifting it upright; but then the iron bar would prevent them from\r\nachieving the work of rescue, and the crab would again heavily fall upon\r\nits back. After many attempts, one of the helpers would go in the depth\r\nof the tank and bring two other crabs, which would begin with fresh\r\nforces the same pushing and lifting of their helpless comrade. We stayed\r\nin the Aquarium for more than two hours, and, when leaving, we again\r\ncame to cast a glance upon the tank: the work of rescue still continued!\r\nSince I saw that, I cannot refuse credit to the observation quoted by\r\nDr. Erasmus Darwin--namely, that \"the common crab during the moulting\r\nseason stations as sentinel an unmoulted or hard-shelled individual to\r\nprevent marine enemies from injuring moulted individuals in their\r\nunprotected state.\"(5)\r\n\r\nFacts illustrating mutual aid amidst the termites, the ants, and the\r\nbees are so well known to the general reader, especially through the\r\nworks of Romanes, L. Buchner, and Sir John Lubbock, that I may limit my\r\nremarks to a very few hints.(6) If we take an ants' nest, we not only\r\nsee that every description of work-rearing of progeny, foraging,\r\nbuilding, rearing of aphides, and so on--is performed according to the\r\nprinciples of voluntary mutual aid; we must also recognize, with Forel,\r\nthat the chief, the fundamental feature of the life of many species of\r\nants is the fact and the obligation for every ant of sharing its food,\r\nalready swallowed and partly digested, with every member of the\r\ncommunity which may apply for it. Two ants belonging to two different\r\nspecies or to two hostile nests, when they occasionally meet together,\r\nwill avoid each other. But two ants belonging to the same nest or to the\r\nsame colony of nests will approach each other, exchange a few movements\r\nwith the antennae, and \"if one of them is hungry or thirsty, and\r\nespecially if the other has its crop full ... it immediately asks for\r\nfood.\" The individual thus requested never refuses; it sets apart its\r\nmandibles, takes a proper position, and regurgitates a drop of\r\ntransparent fluid which is licked up by the hungry ant. Regurgitating\r\nfood for other ants is so prominent a feature in the life of ants (at\r\nliberty), and it so constantly recurs both for feeding hungry comrades\r\nand for feeding larvae, that Forel considers the digestive tube of the\r\nants as consisting of two different parts, one of which, the posterior,\r\nis for the special use of the individual, and the other, the anterior\r\npart, is chiefly for the use of the community. If an ant which has its\r\ncrop full has been selfish enough to refuse feeding a comrade, it will\r\nbe treated as an enemy, or even worse. If the refusal has been made\r\nwhile its kinsfolk were fighting with some other species, they will fall\r\nback upon the greedy individual with greater vehemence than even upon\r\nthe enemies themselves. And if an ant has not refused to feed another\r\nant belonging to an enemy species, it will be treated by the kinsfolk of\r\nthe latter as a friend. All this is confirmed by most accurate\r\nobservation and decisive experiments.(7)\r\n\r\nIn that immense division of the animal kingdom which embodies more than\r\none thousand species, and is so numerous that the Brazilians pretend\r\nthat Brazil belongs to the ants, not to men, competition amidst the\r\nmembers of the same nest, or the colony of nests, does not exist.\r\nHowever terrible the wars between different species, and whatever the\r\natrocities committed at war-time, mutual aid within the community,\r\nself-devotion grown into a habit, and very often self-sacrifice for the\r\ncommon welfare, are the rule. The ants and termites have renounced the\r\n\"Hobbesian war,\" and they are the better for it. Their wonderful nests,\r\ntheir buildings, superior in relative size to those of man; their paved\r\nroads and overground vaulted galleries; their spacious halls and\r\ngranaries; their corn-fields, harvesting and \"malting\" of grain;(8)\r\ntheir, rational methods of nursing their eggs and larvae, and of\r\nbuilding special nests for rearing the aphides whom Linnaeus so\r\npicturesquely described as \"the cows of the ants\"; and, finally, their\r\ncourage, pluck, and, superior intelligence--all these are the natural\r\noutcome of the mutual aid which they practise at every stage of their\r\nbusy and laborious lives. That mode of life also necessarily resulted in\r\nthe development of another essential feature of the life of ants: the\r\nimmense development of individual initiative which, in its turn,\r\nevidently led to the development of that high and varied intelligence\r\nwhich cannot but strike the human observer.(9)\r\n\r\nIf we knew no other facts from animal life than what we know about the\r\nants and the termites, we already might safely conclude that mutual aid\r\n(which leads to mutual confidence, the first condition for courage) and\r\nindividual initiative (the first condition for intellectual progress)\r\nare two factors infinitely more important than mutual struggle in the\r\nevolution of the animal kingdom. In fact, the ant thrives without having\r\nany of the \"protective\" features which cannot be dispensed with by\r\nanimals living an isolated life. Its colour renders it conspicuous to\r\nits enemies, and the lofty nests of many species are conspicuous in the\r\nmeadows and forests. It is not protected by a hard carapace, and its\r\nstinging apparatus, however dangerous when hundreds of stings are\r\nplunged into the flesh of an animal, is not of a great value for\r\nindividual defence; while the eggs and larvae of the ants are a dainty\r\nfor a great number of the inhabitants of the forests. And yet the ants,\r\nin their thousands, are not much destroyed by the birds, not even by the\r\nant-eaters, and they are dreaded by most stronger insects. When Forel\r\nemptied a bagful of ants in a meadow, he saw that \"the crickets ran\r\naway, abandoning their holes to be sacked by the ants; the grasshoppers\r\nand the crickets fled in all directions; the spiders and the beetles\r\nabandoned their prey in order not to become prey themselves;\" even the\r\nnests of the wasps were taken by the ants, after a battle during which\r\nmany ants perished for the safety of the commonwealth. Even the swiftest\r\ninsects cannot escape, and Forel often saw butterflies, gnats, flies,\r\nand so on, surprised and killed by the ants. Their force is in mutual\r\nsupport and mutual confidence. And if the ant--apart from the still\r\nhigher developed termites--stands at the very top of the whole class of\r\ninsects for its intellectual capacities; if its courage is only equalled\r\nby the most courageous vertebrates; and if its brain--to use Darwin's\r\nwords--\"is one of the most marvellous atoms of matter in the world,\r\nperhaps more so than the brain of man,\" is it not due to the fact that\r\nmutual aid has entirely taken the place of mutual struggle in the\r\ncommunities of ants?\r\n\r\nThe same is true as regards the bees. These small insects, which so\r\neasily might become the prey of so many birds, and whose honey has so\r\nmany admirers in all classes of animals from the beetle to the bear,\r\nalso have none of the protective features derived from mimicry or\r\notherwise, without which an isolatedly living insect hardly could escape\r\nwholesale destruction; and yet, owing to the mutual aid they practise,\r\nthey obtain the wide extension which we know and the intelligence we\r\nadmire, By working in common they multiply their individual forces; by\r\nresorting to a temporary division of labour combined with the capacity\r\nof each bee to perform every kind of work when required, they attain\r\nsuch a degree of well-being and safety as no isolated animal can ever\r\nexpect to achieve however strong or well armed it may be. In their\r\ncombinations they are often more successful than man, when he neglects\r\nto take advantage of a well-planned mutual assistance. Thus, when a new\r\nswarm of bees is going to leave the hive in search of a new abode, a\r\nnumber of bees will make a preliminary exploration of the neighbourhood,\r\nand if they discover a convenient dwelling-place--say, an old basket, or\r\nanything of the kind--they will take possession of it, clean it, and\r\nguard it, sometimes for a whole week, till the swarm comes to settle\r\ntherein. But how many human settlers will perish in new countries simply\r\nfor not having understood the necessity of combining their efforts! By\r\ncombining their individual intelligences they succeed in coping with\r\nadverse circumstances, even quite unforeseen and unusual, like those\r\nbees of the Paris Exhibition which fastened with their resinous propolis\r\nthe shutter to a glass-plate fitted in the wall of their hive. Besides,\r\nthey display none of the sanguinary proclivities and love of useless\r\nfighting with which many writers so readily endow animals. The sentries\r\nwhich guard the entrance to the hive pitilessly put to death the robbing\r\nbees which attempt entering the hive; but those stranger bees which come\r\nto the hive by mistake are left unmolested, especially if they come\r\nladen with pollen, or are young individuals which can easily go astray.\r\nThere is no more warfare than is strictly required.\r\n\r\nThe sociability of the bees is the more instructive as predatory\r\ninstincts and laziness continue to exist among the bees as well, and\r\nreappear each time that their growth is favoured by some circumstances.\r\nIt is well known that there always are a number of bees which prefer a\r\nlife of robbery to the laborious life of a worker; and that both periods\r\nof scarcity and periods of an unusually rich supply of food lead to an\r\nincrease of the robbing class. When our crops are in and there remains\r\nbut little to gather in our meadows and fields, robbing bees become of\r\nmore frequent occurrence; while, on the other side, about the sugar\r\nplantations of the West Indies and the sugar refineries of Europe,\r\nrobbery, laziness, and very often drunkenness become quite usual with\r\nthe bees. We thus see that anti-social instincts continue to exist\r\namidst the bees as well; but natural selection continually must\r\neliminate them, because in the long run the practice of solidarity\r\nproves much more advantageous to the species than the development of\r\nindividuals endowed with predatory inclinations. The cunningest and the\r\nshrewdest are eliminated in favour of those who understand the\r\nadvantages of sociable life and mutual support.\r\n\r\nCertainly, neither the ants, nor the bees, nor even the termites, have\r\nrisen to the conception of a higher solidarity embodying the whole of\r\nthe species. In that respect they evidently have not attained a degree\r\nof development which we do not find even among our political,\r\nscientific, and religious leaders. Their social instincts hardly extend\r\nbeyond the limits of the hive or the nest. However, colonies of no less\r\nthan two hundred nests, belonging to two different species (Formica\r\nexsecta and F. pressilabris) have been described by Forel on Mount\r\nTendre and Mount Saleve; and Forel maintains that each member of these\r\ncolonies recognizes every other member of the colony, and that they all\r\ntake part in common defence; while in Pennsylvania Mr. MacCook saw a\r\nwhole nation of from 1,600 to 1,700 nests of the mound-making ant, all\r\nliving in perfect intelligence; and Mr. Bates has described the hillocks\r\nof the termites covering large surfaces in the \"campos\"--some of the\r\nnests being the refuge of two or three different species, and most of\r\nthem being connected by vaulted galleries or arcades.(10) Some steps\r\ntowards the amalgamation of larger divisions of the species for purposes\r\nof mutual protection are thus met with even among the invertebrate\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nGoing now over to higher animals, we find far more instances of\r\nundoubtedly conscious mutual help for all possible purposes, though we\r\nmust recognize at once that our knowledge even of the life of higher\r\nanimals still remains very imperfect. A large number of facts have been\r\naccumulated by first-rate observers, but there are whole divisions of\r\nthe animal kingdom of which we know almost nothing. Trustworthy\r\ninformation as regards fishes is extremely scarce, partly owing to the\r\ndifficulties of observation, and partly because no proper attention has\r\nyet been paid to the subject. As to the mammalia, Kessler already\r\nremarked how little we know about their manners of life. Many of them\r\nare nocturnal in their habits; others conceal themselves underground;\r\nand those ruminants whose social life and migrations offer the greatest\r\ninterest do not let man approach their herds. It is chiefly upon birds\r\nthat we have the widest range of information, and yet the social life of\r\nvery many species remains but imperfectly known. Still, we need not\r\ncomplain about the lack of well-ascertained facts, as will be seen from\r\nthe following.\r\n\r\nI need not dwell upon the associations of male and female for rearing\r\ntheir offspring, for providing it with food during their first steps in\r\nlife, or for hunting in common; though it may be mentioned by the way\r\nthat such associations are the rule even with the least sociable\r\ncarnivores and rapacious birds; and that they derive a special interest\r\nfrom being the field upon which tenderer feelings develop even amidst\r\notherwise most cruel animals. It may also be added that the rarity of\r\nassociations larger than that of the family among the carnivores and the\r\nbirds of prey, though mostly being the result of their very modes of\r\nfeeding, can also be explained to some extent as a consequence of the\r\nchange produced in the animal world by the rapid increase of mankind. At\r\nany rate it is worthy of note that there are species living a quite\r\nisolated life in densely-inhabited regions, while the same species, or\r\ntheir nearest congeners, are gregarious in uninhabited countries.\r\nWolves, foxes, and several birds of prey may be quoted as instances in\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nHowever, associations which do not extend beyond the family bonds are of\r\nrelatively small importance in our case, the more so as we know numbers\r\nof associations for more general purposes, such as hunting, mutual\r\nprotection, and even simple enjoyment of life. Audubon already mentioned\r\nthat eagles occasionally associate for hunting, and his description of\r\nthe two bald eagles, male and female, hunting on the Mississippi, is\r\nwell known for its graphic powers. But one of the most conclusive\r\nobservations of the kind belongs to Syevertsoff. Whilst studying the\r\nfauna of the Russian Steppes, he once saw an eagle belonging to an\r\naltogether gregarious species (the white-tailed eagle, Haliactos\r\nalbicilla) rising high in the air for half an hour it was describing its\r\nwide circles in silence when at once its piercing voice was heard. Its\r\ncry was soon answered by another eagle which approached it, and was\r\nfollowed by a third, a fourth, and so on, till nine or ten eagles came\r\ntogether and soon disappeared. In the afternoon, Syevertsoff went to the\r\nplace whereto he saw the eagles flying; concealed by one of the\r\nundulations of the Steppe, he approached them, and discovered that they\r\nhad gathered around the corpse of a horse. The old ones, which, as a\r\nrule, begin the meal first--such are their rules of propriety-already\r\nwere sitting upon the haystacks of the neighbourhood and kept watch,\r\nwhile the younger ones were continuing the meal, surrounded by bands of\r\ncrows. From this and like observations, Syevertsoff concluded that the\r\nwhite-tailed eagles combine for hunting; when they all have risen to a\r\ngreat height they are enabled, if they are ten, to survey an area of at\r\nleast twenty-five miles square; and as soon as any one has discovered\r\nsomething, he warns the others.(11) Of course, it might be argued that a\r\nsimple instinctive cry of the first eagle, or even its movements, would\r\nhave had the same effect of bringing several eagles to the prey. But in\r\nthis case there is strong evidence in favour of mutual warning, because\r\nthe ten eagles came together before descending towards the prey, and\r\nSyevertsoff had later on several opportunities of ascertaining that the\r\nwhitetailed eagles always assemble for devouring a corpse, and that some\r\nof them (the younger ones first) always keep watch while the others are\r\neating. In fact, the white-tailed eagle--one of the bravest and best\r\nhunters--is a gregarious bird altogether, and Brehm says that when kept\r\nin captivity it very soon contracts an attachment to its keepers.\r\n\r\nSociability is a common feature with very many other birds of prey. The\r\nBrazilian kite, one of the most \"impudent\" robbers, is nevertheless a\r\nmost sociable bird. Its hunting associations have been described by\r\nDarwin and other naturalists, and it is a fact that when it has seized\r\nupon a prey which is too big, it calls together five or six friends to\r\ncarry it away. After a busy day, when these kites retire for their\r\nnight-rest to a tree or to the bushes, they always gather in bands,\r\nsometimes coming together from distances of ten or more miles, and they\r\noften are joined by several other vultures, especially the percnopters,\r\n\"their true friends,\" D'Orbigny says. In another continent, in the\r\nTranscaspian deserts, they have, according to Zarudnyi, the same habit\r\nof nesting together. The sociable vulture, one of the strongest\r\nvultures, has received its very name from its love of society. They live\r\nin numerous bands, and decidedly enjoy society; numbers of them join in\r\ntheir high flights for sport. \"They live in very good friendship,\" Le\r\nVaillant says, \"and in the same cave I sometimes found as many as three\r\nnests close together.\"(12) The Urubu vultures of Brazil are as, or\r\nperhaps even more, sociable than rooks.(13) The little Egyptian vultures\r\nlive in close friendship. They play in bands in the air, they come\r\ntogether to spend the night, and in the morning they all go together to\r\nsearch for their food, and never does the slightest quarrel arise among\r\nthem; such is the testimony of Brehm, who had plenty of opportunities of\r\nobserving their life. The red-throated falcon is also met with in\r\nnumerous bands in the forests of Brazil, and the kestrel (Tinnunculus\r\ncenchris), when it has left Europe, and has reached in the winter the\r\nprairies and forests of Asia, gathers in numerous societies. In the\r\nSteppes of South Russia it is (or rather was) so sociable that Nordmann\r\nsaw them in numerous bands, with other falcons (Falco tinnunculus, F.\r\noesulon, and F. subbuteo), coming together every fine afternoon about\r\nfour o'clock, and enjoying their sports till late in the night. They set\r\noff flying, all at once, in a quite straight line, towards some\r\ndetermined point, and, having reached it, immediately returned over the\r\nsame line, to repeat the same flight.(14)\r\n\r\nTo take flights in flocks for the mere pleasure of the flight, is quite\r\ncommon among all sorts of birds. \"In the Humber district especially,\"\r\nCh. Dixon writes, \"vast flights of dunlins often appear upon the\r\nmud-flats towards the end of August, and remain for the winter.... The\r\nmovements of these birds are most interesting, as a vast flock wheels\r\nand spreads out or closes up with as much precision as drilled troops.\r\nScattered among them are many odd stints and sanderlings and\r\nringed-plovers.\"(15)\r\n\r\nIt would be quite impossible to enumerate here the various hunting\r\nassociations of birds; but the fishing associations of the pelicans are\r\ncertainly worthy of notice for the remarkable order and intelligence\r\ndisplayed by these clumsy birds. They always go fishing in numerous\r\nbands, and after having chosen an appropriate bay, they form a wide\r\nhalf-circle in face of the shore, and narrow it by paddling towards the\r\nshore, catching all fish that happen to be enclosed in the circle. On\r\nnarrow rivers and canals they even divide into two parties, each of\r\nwhich draws up on a half-circle, and both paddle to meet each other,\r\njust as if two parties of men dragging two long nets should advance to\r\ncapture all fish taken between the nets when both parties come to meet.\r\nAs the night comes they fly to their resting-places--always the same for\r\neach flock--and no one has ever seen them fighting for the possession of\r\neither the bay or the resting place. In South America they gather in\r\nflocks of from forty to fifty thousand individuals, part of which enjoy\r\nsleep while the others keep watch, and others again go fishing.(16) And\r\nfinally, I should be doing an injustice to the much-calumniated\r\nhouse-sparrows if I did not mention how faithfully each of them shares\r\nany food it discovers with all members of the society to which it\r\nbelongs. The fact was known to the Greeks, and it has been transmitted\r\nto posterity how a Greek orator once exclaimed (I quote from\r\nmemory):--\"While I am speaking to you a sparrow has come to tell to\r\nother sparrows that a slave has dropped on the floor a sack of corn, and\r\nthey all go there to feed upon the grain.\" The more, one is pleased to\r\nfind this observation of old confirmed in a recent little book by Mr.\r\nGurney, who does not doubt that the house sparrows always inform each\r\nother as to where there is some food to steal; he says, \"When a stack\r\nhas been thrashed ever so far from the yard, the sparrows in the yard\r\nhave always had their crops full of the grain.\"(17) True, the sparrows\r\nare extremely particular in keeping their domains free from the\r\ninvasions of strangers; thus the sparrows of the Jardin du Luxembourg\r\nbitterly fight all other sparrows which may attempt to enjoy their turn\r\nof the garden and its visitors; but within their own communities they\r\nfully practise mutual support, though occasionally there will be of\r\ncourse some quarrelling even amongst the best friends.\r\n\r\nHunting and feeding in common is so much the habit in the feathered\r\nworld that more quotations hardly would be needful: it must be\r\nconsidered as an established fact. As to the force derived from such\r\nassociations, it is self-evident. The strongest birds of prey are\r\npowerless in face of the associations of our smallest bird pets. Even\r\neagles--even the powerful and terrible booted eagle, and the martial\r\neagle, which is strong enough to carry away a hare or a young antelope\r\nin its claws--are compelled to abandon their prey to bands of those\r\nbeggars the kites, which give the eagle a regular chase as soon as they\r\nsee it in possession of a good prey. The kites will also give chase to\r\nthe swift fishing-hawk, and rob it of the fish it has captured; but no\r\none ever saw the kites fighting together for the possession of the prey\r\nso stolen. On the Kerguelen Island, Dr. Coues saw the gulls to\r\nBuphogus--the sea-hen of the sealers--pursue make them disgorge their\r\nfood, while, on the other side, the gulls and the terns combined to\r\ndrive away the sea-hen as soon as it came near to their abodes,\r\nespecially at nesting-time.(18) The little, but extremely swift lapwings\r\n(Vanellus cristatus) boldly attack the birds of prey. \"To see them\r\nattacking a buzzard, a kite, a crow, or an eagle, is one of the most\r\namusing spectacles. One feels that they are sure of victory, and one\r\nsees the anger of the bird of prey. In such circumstances they perfectly\r\nsupport one another, and their courage grows with their numbers.\"(19)\r\nThe lapwing has well merited the name of a \"good mother\" which the\r\nGreeks gave to it, for it never fails to protect other aquatic birds\r\nfrom the attacks of their enemies. But even the little white wagtails\r\n(Motacilla alba), whom we well know in our gardens and whose whole\r\nlength hardly attains eight inches, compel the sparrow-hawk to abandon\r\nits hunt. \"I often admired their courage and agility,\" the old Brehm\r\nwrote, \"and I am persuaded that the falcon alone is capable of capturing\r\nany of them.... When a band of wagtails has compelled a bird of prey to\r\nretreat, they make the air resound with their triumphant cries, and\r\nafter that they separate.\" They thus come together for the special\r\npurpose of giving chase to their enemy, just as we see it when the whole\r\nbird-population of a forest has been raised by the news that a nocturnal\r\nbird has made its appearance during the day, and all together--birds of\r\nprey and small inoffensive singers--set to chase the stranger and make\r\nit return to its concealment.\r\n\r\nWhat an immense difference between the force of a kite, a buzzard or a\r\nhawk, and such small birds as the meadow-wagtail; and yet these little\r\nbirds, by their common action and courage, prove superior to the\r\npowerfully-winged and armed robbers! In Europe, the wagtails not only\r\nchase the birds of prey which might be dangerous to them, but they chase\r\nalso the fishing-hawk \"rather for fun than for doing it any harm;\" while\r\nin India, according to Dr. Jerdon's testimony, the jackdaws chase the\r\ngowinda-kite \"for simple matter of amusement.\" Prince Wied saw the\r\nBrazilian eagle urubitinga surrounded by numberless flocks of toucans\r\nand cassiques (a bird nearly akin to our rook), which mocked it. \"The\r\neagle,\" he adds, \"usually supports these insults very quietly, but from\r\ntime to time it will catch one of these mockers.\" In all such cases the\r\nlittle birds, though very much inferior in force to the bird of prey,\r\nprove superior to it by their common action.(20)\r\n\r\nHowever, the most striking effects of common life for the security of\r\nthe individual, for its enjoyment of life, and for the development of\r\nits intellectual capacities, are seen in two great families of birds,\r\nthe cranes and the parrots. The cranes are extremely sociable and live\r\nin most excellent relations, not only with their congeners, but also\r\nwith most aquatic birds. Their prudence is really astonishing, so also\r\ntheir intelligence; they grasp the new conditions in a moment, and act\r\naccordingly. Their sentries always keep watch around a flock which is\r\nfeeding or resting, and the hunters know well how difficult it is to\r\napproach them. If man has succeeded in surprising them, they will never\r\nreturn to the same place without having sent out one single scout first,\r\nand a party of scouts afterwards; and when the reconnoitring party\r\nreturns and reports that there is no danger, a second group of scouts is\r\nsent out to verify the first report, before the whole band moves. With\r\nkindred species the cranes contract real friendship; and in captivity\r\nthere is no bird, save the also sociable and highly intelligent parrot,\r\nwhich enters into such real friendship with man. \"It sees in man, not a\r\nmaster, but a friend, and endeavours to manifest it,\" Brehm concludes\r\nfrom a wide personal experience. The crane is in continual activity from\r\nearly in the morning till late in the night; but it gives a few hours\r\nonly in the morning to the task of searching its food, chiefly\r\nvegetable. All the remainder of the day is given to society life. \"It\r\npicks up small pieces of wood or small stones, throws them in the air\r\nand tries to catch them; it bends its neck, opens its wings, dances,\r\njumps, runs about, and tries to manifest by all means its good\r\ndisposition of mind, and always it remains graceful and beautiful.\"(21)\r\nAs it lives in society it has almost no enemies, and though Brehm\r\noccasionally saw one of them captured by a crocodile, he wrote that\r\nexcept the crocodile he knew no enemies of the crane. It eschews all of\r\nthem by its proverbial prudence; and it attains, as a rule, a very old\r\nage. No wonder that for the maintenance of the species the crane need\r\nnot rear a numerous offspring; it usually hatches but two eggs. As to\r\nits superior intelligence, it is sufficient to say that all observers\r\nare unanimous in recognizing that its intellectual capacities remind one\r\nvery much of those of man.\r\n\r\nThe other extremely sociable bird, the parrot, stands, as known, at the\r\nvery top of the whole feathered world for the development of its\r\nintelligence. Brehm has so admirably summed up the manners of life of\r\nthe parrot, that I cannot do better than translate the following\r\nsentence:--\r\n\r\n\"Except in the pairing season, they live in very numerous societies or\r\nbands. They choose a place in the forest to stay there, and thence they\r\nstart every morning for their hunting expeditions. The members of each\r\nband remain faithfully attached to each other, and they share in common\r\ngood or bad luck. All together they repair in the morning to a field, or\r\nto a garden, or to a tree, to feed upon fruits. They post sentries to\r\nkeep watch over the safety of the whole band, and are attentive to their\r\nwarnings. In case of danger, all take to flight, mutually supporting\r\neach other, and all simultaneously return to their resting-place. In a\r\nword, they always live closely united.\"\r\n\r\nThey enjoy society of other birds as well. In India, the jays and crows\r\ncome together from many miles round, to spend the night in company with\r\nthe parrots in the bamboo thickets. When the parrots start hunting, they\r\ndisplay the most wonderful intelligence, prudence, and capacity of\r\ncoping with circumstances. Take, for instance, a band of white cacadoos\r\nin Australia. Before starting to plunder a corn-field, they first send\r\nout a reconnoitring party which occupies the highest trees in the\r\nvicinity of the field, while other scouts perch upon the intermediate\r\ntrees between the field and the forest and transmit the signals. If the\r\nreport runs \"All right,\" a score of cacadoos will separate from the bulk\r\nof the band, take a flight in the air, and then fly towards the trees\r\nnearest to the field. They also will scrutinize the neighbourhood for a\r\nlong while, and only then will they give the signal for general advance,\r\nafter which the whole band starts at once and plunders the field in no\r\ntime. The Australian settlers have the greatest difficulties in\r\nbeguiling the prudence of the parrots; but if man, with all his art and\r\nweapons, has succeeded in killing some of them, the cacadoos become so\r\nprudent and watchful that they henceforward baffle all stratagems.(22)\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that it is the practice of life in society which\r\nenables the parrots to attain that very high level of almost human\r\nintelligence and almost human feelings which we know in them. Their high\r\nintelligence has induced the best naturalists to describe some species,\r\nnamely the grey parrot, as the \"birdman.\" As to their mutual attachment\r\nit is known that when a parrot has been killed by a hunter, the others\r\nfly over the corpse of their comrade with shrieks of complaints and\r\n\"themselves fall the victims of their friendship,\" as Audubon said; and\r\nwhen two captive parrots, though belonging to two different species,\r\nhave contracted mutual friendship, the accidental death of one of the\r\ntwo friends has sometimes been followed by the death from grief and\r\nsorrow of the other friend. It is no less evident that in their\r\nsocieties they find infinitely more protection than they possibly might\r\nfind in any ideal development of beak and claw. Very few birds of prey\r\nor mammals dare attack any but the smaller species of parrots, and Brehm\r\nis absolutely right in saying of the parrots, as he also says of the\r\ncranes and the sociable monkeys, that they hardly have any enemies\r\nbesides men; and he adds: \"It is most probable that the larger parrots\r\nsuccumb chiefly to old age rather than die from the claws of any\r\nenemies.\" Only man, owing to his still more superior intelligence and\r\nweapons, also derived from association, succeeds in partially destroying\r\nthem. Their very longevity would thus appear as a result of their social\r\nlife. Could we not say the same as regards their wonderful memory, which\r\nalso must be favoured in its development by society--life and by\r\nlongevity accompanied by a full enjoyment of bodily and mental faculties\r\ntill a very old age?\r\n\r\nAs seen from the above, the war of each against all is not the law of\r\nnature. Mutual aid is as much a law of nature as mutual struggle, and\r\nthat law will become still more apparent when we have analyzed some\r\nother associations of birds and those of the mammalia. A few hints as to\r\nthe importance of the law of mutual aid for the evolution of the animal\r\nkingdom have already been given in the preceding pages; but their\r\npurport will still better appear when, after having given a few more\r\nillustrations, we shall be enabled presently to draw therefrom our\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1.

Leaving aside the pre-Darwinian writers, like Toussenel, Fee, and\r\nmany others, several works containing many striking instances of mutual\r\naid--chiefly, however, illustrating animal intelligence were issued\r\npreviously to that date. I may mention those of Houzeau, Les facultes\r\netales des animaux, 2 vols., Brussels, 1872; L. Buchner's Aus dem\r\nGeistesleben der Thiere, 2nd ed. in 1877; and Maximilian Perty's Ueber\r\ndas Seelenleben der Thiere, Leipzig, 1876. Espinas published his most\r\nremarkable work, Les Societes animales, in 1877, and in that work he\r\npointed out the importance of animal societies, and their bearing upon\r\nthe preservation of species, and entered upon a most valuable discussion\r\nof the origin of societies. In fact, Espinas's book contains all that\r\nhas been written since upon mutual aid, and many good things besides. If\r\nI nevertheless make a special mention of Kessler's address, it is\r\nbecause he raised mutual aid to the height of a law much more important\r\nin evolution than the law of mutual struggle. The same ideas were\r\ndeveloped next year (in April 1881) by J. Lanessan in a lecture\r\npublished in 1882 under this title: La lutte pour l'existence et\r\nl'association pour la lutte. G. Romanes's capital work, Animal\r\nIntelligence, was issued in 1882, and followed next year by the Mental\r\nEvolution in Animals. About the same time (1883), Buchner published\r\nanother work, Liebe und Liebes-Leben in der Thierwelt, a second edition\r\nof which was issued in 1885. The idea, as seen, was in the air.\r\n\r\n4.

They kept dashing at him in scores, and\r\nfrom all points at once. The unfortunate hawk was quite powerless. At\r\nlast, approaching some scrub, the hawk dashed into it and remained\r\nthere, while the sparrows congregated in groups round the bush, keeping\r\nup a constant chattering and noise\" (Paper read before the New Zealand\r\nInstitute; Nature, Oct. 10, 1891).\r\n\r\n21.

Elimination of competition in\r\nNature.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as spring comes back to the temperate zone, myriads and myriads\r\nof birds which are scattered over the warmer regions of the South come\r\ntogether in numberless bands, and, full of vigour and joy, hasten\r\nnorthwards to rear their offspring. Each of our hedges, each grove, each\r\nocean cliff, and each of the lakes and ponds with which Northern\r\nAmerica, Northern Europe, and Northern Asia are dotted tell us at that\r\ntime of the year the tale of what mutual aid means for the birds; what\r\nforce, energy, and protection it confers to every living being, however\r\nfeeble and defenceless it otherwise might be. Take, for instance, one of\r\nthe numberless lakes of the Russian and Siberian Steppes. Its shores are\r\npeopled with myriads of aquatic birds, belonging to at least a score of\r\ndifferent species, all living in perfect peace--all protecting one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"For several hundred yards from the shore the air is filled with gulls\r\nand terns, as with snow-flakes on a winter day. Thousands of plovers and\r\nsand-coursers run over the beach, searching their food, whistling, and\r\nsimply enjoying life. Further on, on almost each wave, a duck is\r\nrocking, while higher up you notice the flocks of the Casarki ducks.\r\nExuberant life swarms everywhere.\"(1)\r\n\r\nAnd here are the robbers--the strongest, the most cunning ones, those\r\n\"ideally organized for robbery.\" And you hear their hungry, angry,\r\ndismal cries as for hours in succession they watch the opportunity of\r\nsnatching from this mass of living beings one single unprotected\r\nindividual. But as soon as they approach, their presence is signalled by\r\ndozens of voluntary sentries, and hundreds of gulls and terns set to\r\nchase the robber. Maddened by hunger, the robber soon abandons his usual\r\nprecautions: he suddenly dashes into the living mass; but, attacked from\r\nall sides, he again is compelled to retreat. From sheer despair he falls\r\nupon the wild ducks; but the intelligent, social birds rapidly gather in\r\na flock and fly away if the robber is an erne; they plunge into the lake\r\nif it is a falcon; or they raise a cloud of water-dust and bewilder the\r\nassailant if it is a kite.(2) And while life continues to swarm on the\r\nlake, the robber flies away with cries of anger, and looks out for\r\ncarrion, or for a young bird or a field-mouse not yet used to obey in\r\ntime the warnings of its comrades. In the face of an exuberant life, the\r\nideally-armed robber must be satisfied with the off-fall of that life.\r\n\r\nFurther north, in the Arctic archipelagoes,\r\n\r\n\"you may sail along the coast for many miles and see all the ledges, all\r\nthe cliffs and corners of the mountain-sides, up to a height of from two\r\nto five hundred feet, literally covered with sea-birds, whose white\r\nbreasts show against the dark rocks as if the rocks were closely\r\nsprinkled with chalk specks. The air, near and far, is, so to say, full\r\nwith fowls.\"(3)\r\n\r\nEach of such \"bird-mountains\" is a living illustration of mutual aid, as\r\nwell as of the infinite variety of characters, individual and specific,\r\nresulting from social life. The oyster-catcher is renowned for its\r\nreadiness to attack the birds of prey. The barge is known for its\r\nwatchfulness, and it easily becomes the leader of more placid birds. The\r\nturnstone, when surrounded by comrades belonging to more energetic\r\nspecies, is a rather timorous bird; but it undertakes to keep watch for\r\nthe security of the commonwealth when surrounded by smaller birds. Here\r\nyou have the dominative swans; there, the extremely sociable\r\nkittiwake-gulls, among whom quarrels are rare and short; the\r\nprepossessing polar guillemots, which continually caress each other; the\r\negoist she-goose, who has repudiated the orphans of a killed comrade;\r\nand, by her side, another female who adopts any one's orphans, and now\r\npaddles surrounded by fifty or sixty youngsters, whom she conducts and\r\ncares for as if they all were her own breed. Side by side with the\r\npenguins, which steal one another's eggs, you have the dotterels, whose\r\nfamily relations are so \"charming and touching\" that even passionate\r\nhunters recoil from shooting a female surrounded by her young ones; or\r\nthe eider-ducks, among which (like the velvet-ducks, or the coroyas of\r\nthe Savannahs) several females hatch together in the same nest, or the\r\nlums, which sit in turn upon a common covey. Nature is variety itself,\r\noffering all possible varieties of characters, from the basest to the\r\nhighest: and that is why she cannot be depicted by any sweeping\r\nassertion. Still less can she be judged from the moralist's point of\r\nview, because the views of the moralist are themselves a result--mostly\r\nunconscious--of the observation of Nature.\r\n\r\nComing together at nesting-time is so common with most birds that more\r\nexamples are scarcely needed. Our trees are crowned with groups of\r\ncrows' nests; our hedges are full of nests of smaller birds; our\r\nfarmhouses give shelter to colonies of swallows; our old towers are the\r\nrefuge of hundreds of nocturnal birds; and pages might be filled with\r\nthe most charming descriptions of the peace and harmony which prevail in\r\nalmost all these nesting associations. As to the protection derived by\r\nthe weakest birds from their unions, it is evident. That excellent\r\nobserver, Dr. Coues, saw, for instance, the little cliff-swallows\r\nnesting in the immediate neighbourhood of the prairie falcon (Falco\r\npolyargus). The falcon had its nest on the top of one of the minarets of\r\nclay which are so common in the canons of Colorado, while a colony of\r\nswallows nested just beneath. The little peaceful birds had no fear of\r\ntheir rapacious neighbour; they never let it approach to their colony.\r\nThey immediately surrounded it and chased it, so that it had to make off\r\nat once.(4)\r\n\r\nLife in societies does not cease when the nesting period is over; it\r\nbegins then in a new form. The young broods gather in societies of\r\nyoungsters, generally including several species. Social life is\r\npractised at that time chiefly for its own sake--partly for security,\r\nbut chiefly for the pleasures derived from it. So we see in our forests\r\nthe societies formed by the young nuthatchers (Sitta caesia), together\r\nwith tit-mouses, chaffinches, wrens, tree-creepers, or some\r\nwood-peckers.(5) In Spain the swallow is met with in company with\r\nkestrels, fly-catchers, and even pigeons. In the Far West of America the\r\nyoung horned larks live in large societies, together with another lark\r\n(Sprague's), the skylark, the Savannah sparrow, and several species of\r\nbuntings and longspurs.(6) In fact, it would be much easier to describe\r\nthe species which live isolated than to simply name those species which\r\njoin the autumnal societies of young birds--not for hunting or nesting\r\npurposes, but simply to enjoy life in society and to spend their time in\r\nplays and sports, after having given a few hours every day to find their\r\ndaily food.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, we have that immense display of mutual aid among\r\nbirds-their migrations--which I dare not even enter upon in this place.\r\nSufficient to say that birds which have lived for months in small bands\r\nscattered over a wide territory gather in thousands; they come together\r\nat a given place, for several days in succession, before they start, and\r\nthey evidently discuss the particulars of the journey. Some species will\r\nindulge every afternoon in flights preparatory to the long passage. All\r\nwait for their tardy congeners, and finally they start in a certain well\r\nchosen direction--a fruit of accumulated collective experience--the\r\nstrongest flying at the head of the band, and relieving one another in\r\nthat difficult task. They cross the seas in large bands consisting of\r\nboth big and small birds, and when they return next spring they repair\r\nto the same spot, and, in most cases, each of them takes possession of\r\nthe very same nest which it had built or repaired the previous year.(7)\r\n\r\nThis subject is so vast, and yet so imperfectly studied; it offers so\r\nmany striking illustrations of mutual-aid habits, subsidiary to the main\r\nfact of migration--each of which would, however, require a special\r\nstudy--that I must refrain from entering here into more details. I can\r\nonly cursorily refer to the numerous and animated gatherings of birds\r\nwhich take place, always on the same spot, before they begin their long\r\njourneys north or south, as also those which one sees in the north,\r\nafter the birds have arrived at their breeding-places on the Yenisei or\r\nin the northern counties of England. For many days in\r\nsuccession--sometimes one month--they will come together every morning\r\nfor one hour, before flying in search of food--perhaps discussing the\r\nspot where they are going to build their nests.(8) And if, during the\r\nmigration, their columns are overtaken by a storm, birds of the most\r\ndifferent species will be brought together by common misfortune. The\r\nbirds which are not exactly migratory, but slowly move northwards and\r\nsouthwards with the seasons, also perform these peregrinations in\r\nflocks. So far from migrating isolately, in order to secure for each\r\nseparate individual the advantages of better food or shelter which are\r\nto be found in another district--they always wait for each other, and\r\ngather in flocks, before they move north or south, in accordance with\r\nthe season.(9)\r\n\r\nGoing now over to mammals, the first thing which strikes us is the\r\noverwhelming numerical predominance of social species over those few\r\ncarnivores which do not associate. The plateaus, the Alpine tracts, and\r\nthe Steppes of the Old and New World are stocked with herds of deer,\r\nantelopes, gazelles, fallow deer, buffaloes, wild goats and sheep, all\r\nof which are sociable animals. When the Europeans came to settle in\r\nAmerica, they found it so densely peopled with buffaloes, that pioneers\r\nhad to stop their advance when a column of migrating buffaloes came to\r\ncross the route they followed; the march past of the dense column\r\nlasting sometimes for two and three days. And when the Russians took\r\npossession of Siberia they found it so densely peopled with deer,\r\nantelopes, squirrels, and other sociable animals, that the very conquest\r\nof Siberia was nothing but a hunting expedition which lasted for two\r\nhundred years; while the grass plains of Eastern Africa are still\r\ncovered with herds composed of zebra, the hartebeest, and other\r\nantelopes.\r\n\r\nNot long ago the small streams of Northern America and Northern Siberia\r\nwere peopled with colonies of beavers, and up to the seventeenth century\r\nlike colonies swarmed in Northern Russia. The flat lands of the four\r\ngreat continents are still covered with countless colonies of mice,\r\nground-squirrels, marmots, and other rodents. In the lower latitudes of\r\nAsia and Africa the forests are still the abode of numerous families of\r\nelephants, rhinoceroses, and numberless societies of monkeys. In the far\r\nnorth the reindeer aggregate in numberless herds; while still further\r\nnorth we find the herds of the musk-oxen and numberless bands of polar\r\nfoxes. The coasts of the ocean are enlivened by flocks of seals and\r\nmorses; its waters, by shoals of sociable cetaceans; and even in the\r\ndepths of the great plateau of Central Asia we find herds of wild\r\nhorses, wild donkeys, wild camels, and wild sheep. All these mammals\r\nlive in societies and nations sometimes numbering hundreds of thousands\r\nof individuals, although now, after three centuries of gunpowder\r\ncivilization, we find but the debris of the immense aggregations of old.\r\nHow trifling, in comparison with them, are the numbers of the\r\ncarnivores! And how false, therefore, is the view of those who speak of\r\nthe animal world as if nothing were to be seen in it but lions and\r\nhyenas plunging their bleeding teeth into the flesh of their victims!\r\nOne might as well imagine that the whole of human life is nothing but a\r\nsuccession of war massacres.\r\n\r\nAssociation and mutual aid are the rule with mammals. We find social\r\nhabits even among the carnivores, and we can only name the cat tribe\r\n(lions, tigers, leopards, etc.) as a division the members of which\r\ndecidedly prefer isolation to society, and are but seldom met with even\r\nin small groups. And yet, even among lions \"this is a very common\r\npractice to hunt in company.\"(10) The two tribes of the civets\r\n(Viverridae) and the weasels (Mustelidae) might also be characterized by\r\ntheir isolated life, but it is a fact that during the last century the\r\ncommon weasel was more sociable than it is now; it was seen then in\r\nlarger groups in Scotland and in the Unterwalden canton of Switzerland.\r\nAs to the great tribe of the dogs, it is eminently sociable, and\r\nassociation for hunting purposes may be considered as eminently\r\ncharacteristic of its numerous species. It is well known, in fact, that\r\nwolves gather in packs for hunting, and Tschudi left an excellent\r\ndescription of how they draw up in a half-circle, surround a cow which\r\nis grazing on a mountain slope, and then, suddenly appearing with a loud\r\nbarking, make it roll in the abyss.(11) Audubon, in the thirties, also\r\nsaw the Labrador wolves hunting in packs, and one pack following a man\r\nto his cabin, and killing the dogs. During severe winters the packs of\r\nwolves grow so numerous as to become a danger for human settlements, as\r\nwas the case in France some five-and-forty years ago. In the Russian\r\nSteppes they never attack the horses otherwise than in packs; and yet\r\nthey have to sustain bitter fights, during which the horses (according\r\nto Kohl's testimony) sometimes assume offensive warfare, and in such\r\ncases, if the wolves do not retreat promptly, they run the risk of being\r\nsurrounded by the horses and killed by their hoofs. The prairie-wolves\r\n(Canis latrans) are known to associate in bands of from twenty to thirty\r\nindividuals when they chase a buffalo occasionally separated from its\r\nherd.(12) Jackals, which are most courageous and may be considered as\r\none of the most intelligent representatives of the dog tribe, always\r\nhunt in packs; thus united, they have no fear of the bigger\r\ncarnivores.(13) As to the wild dogs of Asia (the Kholzuns, or Dholes),\r\nWilliamson saw their large packs attacking all larger animals save\r\nelephants and rhinoceroses, and overpowering bears and tigers. Hyenas\r\nalways live in societies and hunt in packs, and the hunting\r\norganizations of the painted lycaons are highly praised by Cumming. Nay,\r\neven foxes, which, as a rule, live isolated in our civilized countries,\r\nhave been seen combining for hunting purposes.(14) As to the polar fox,\r\nit is--or rather was in Steller's time--one of the most sociable\r\nanimals; and when one reads Steller's description of the war that was\r\nwaged by Behring's unfortunate crew against these intelligent small\r\nanimals, one does not know what to wonder at most: the extraordinary\r\nintelligence of the foxes and the mutual aid they displayed in digging\r\nout food concealed under cairns, or stored upon a pillar (one fox would\r\nclimb on its top and throw the food to its comrades beneath), or the\r\ncruelty of man, driven to despair by the numerous packs of foxes. Even\r\nsome bears live in societies where they are not disturbed by man. Thus\r\nSteller saw the black bear of Kamtchatka in numerous packs, and the\r\npolar bears are occasionally found in small groups. Even the\r\nunintelligent insectivores do not always disdain association.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is especially with the rodents, the ungulata, and the\r\nruminants that we find a highly developed practice of mutual aid. The\r\nsquirrels are individualist to a great extent. Each of them builds its\r\nown comfortable nest, and accumulates its own provision. Their\r\ninclinations are towards family life, and Brehm found that a family of\r\nsquirrels is never so happy as when the two broods of the same year can\r\njoin together with their parents in a remote corner of a forest. And yet\r\nthey maintain social relations. The inhabitants of the separate nests\r\nremain in a close intercourse, and when the pine-cones become rare in\r\nthe forest they inhabit, they emigrate in bands. As to the black\r\nsquirrels of the Far West, they are eminently sociable. Apart from the\r\nfew hours given every day to foraging, they spend their lives in playing\r\nin numerous parties. And when they multiply too rapidly in a region,\r\nthey assemble in bands, almost as numerous as those of locusts, and move\r\nsouthwards, devastating the forests, the fields, and the gardens; while\r\nfoxes, polecats, falcons, and nocturnal birds of prey follow their thick\r\ncolumns and live upon the individuals remaining behind. The\r\nground-squirrel--a closely-akin genus--is still more sociable. It is\r\ngiven to hoarding, and stores up in its subterranean halls large amounts\r\nof edible roots and nuts, usually plundered by man in the autumn.\r\nAccording to some observers, it must know something of the joys of a\r\nmiser. And yet it remains sociable. It always lives in large villages,\r\nand Audubon, who opened some dwellings of the hackee in the winter,\r\nfound several individuals in the same apartment; they must have stored\r\nit with common efforts.\r\n\r\nThe large tribe, of the marmots, which includes the three large genuses\r\nof Arctomys, Cynomys, and Spermophilus, is still more sociable and still\r\nmore intelligent. They also prefer having each one its own dwelling; but\r\nthey live in big villages. That terrible enemy of the crops of South\r\nRussia--the souslik--of which some ten millions are exterminated every\r\nyear by man alone, lives in numberless colonies; and while the Russian\r\nprovincial assemblies gravely discuss the means of getting rid of this\r\nenemy of society, it enjoys life in its thousands in the most joyful\r\nway. Their play is so charming that no observer could refrain from\r\npaying them a tribute of praise, and from mentioning the melodious\r\nconcerts arising from the sharp whistlings of the males and the\r\nmelancholic whistlings of the females, before--suddenly returning to his\r\ncitizen's duties--he begins inventing the most diabolic means for the\r\nextermination of the little robbers. All kinds of rapacious birds and\r\nbeasts of prey having proved powerless, the last word of science in this\r\nwarfare is the inoculation of cholera! The villages of the prairie-dogs\r\nin America are one of the loveliest sights. As far as the eye can\r\nembrace the prairie, it sees heaps of earth, and on each of them a\r\nprairie-dog stands, engaged in a lively conversation with its neighbours\r\nby means of short barkings. As soon as the approach of man is signalled,\r\nall plunge in a moment into their dwellings; all have disappeared as by\r\nenchantment. But if the danger is over, the little creatures soon\r\nreappear. Whole families come out of their galleries and indulge in\r\nplay. The young ones scratch one another, they worry one another, and\r\ndisplay their gracefulness while standing upright, and in the meantime\r\nthe old ones keep watch. They go visiting one another, and the beaten\r\nfootpaths which connect all their heaps testify to the frequency of the\r\nvisitations. In short, the best naturalists have written some of their\r\nbest pages in describing the associations of the prairie-dogs of\r\nAmerica, the marmots of the Old World, and the polar marmots of the\r\nAlpine regions. And yet, I must make, as regards the marmots, the same\r\nremark as I have made when speaking of the bees. They have maintained\r\ntheir fighting instincts, and these instincts reappear in captivity. But\r\nin their big associations, in the face of free Nature, the unsociable\r\ninstincts have no opportunity to develop, and the general result is\r\npeace and harmony.\r\n\r\nEven such harsh animals as the rats, which continually fight in our\r\ncellars, are sufficiently intelligent not to quarrel when they plunder\r\nour larders, but to aid one another in their plundering expeditions and\r\nmigrations, and even to feed their invalids. As to the beaver-rats or\r\nmusk-rats of Canada, they are extremely sociable. Audubon could not but\r\nadmire \"their peaceful communities, which require only being left in\r\npeace to enjoy happiness.\" Like all sociable animals, they are lively\r\nand playful, they easily combine with other species, and they have\r\nattained a very high degree of intellectual development. In their\r\nvillages, always disposed on the shores of lakes and rivers, they take\r\ninto account the changing level of water; their domeshaped houses, which\r\nare built of beaten clay interwoven with reeds, have separate corners\r\nfor organic refuse, and their halls are well carpeted at winter time;\r\nthey are warm, and, nevertheless, well ventilated. As to the beavers,\r\nwhich are endowed, as known, with a most sympathetic character, their\r\nastounding dams and villages, in which generations live and die without\r\nknowing of any enemies but the otter and man, so wonderfully illustrate\r\nwhat mutual aid can achieve for the security of the species, the\r\ndevelopment of social habits, and the evolution of intelligence, that\r\nthey are familiar to all interested in animal life. Let me only remark\r\nthat with the beavers, the muskrats, and some other rodents, we already\r\nfind the feature which will also be distinctive of human\r\ncommunities--that is, work in common.\r\n\r\nI pass in silence the two large families which include the jerboa, the\r\nchinchilla, the biscacha, and the tushkan, or underground hare of South\r\nRussia, though all these small rodents might be taken as excellent\r\nillustrations of the pleasures derived by animals from social life.(15)\r\nPrecisely, the pleasures; because it is extremely difficult to say what\r\nbrings animals together--the needs of mutual protection, or simply the\r\npleasure of feeling surrounded by their congeners. At any rate, our\r\ncommon hares, which do not gather in societies for life in common, and\r\nwhich are not even endowed with intense parental feelings, cannot live\r\nwithout coming together for play. Dietrich de Winckell, who is\r\nconsidered to be among the best acquainted with the habits of hares,\r\ndescribes them as passionate players, becoming so intoxicated by their\r\nplay that a hare has been known to take an approaching fox for a\r\nplaymate.(16) As to the rabbit, it lives in societies, and its family\r\nlife is entirely built upon the image of the old patriarchal family; the\r\nyoung ones being kept in absolute obedience to the father and even the\r\ngrandfather.(17) And here we have the example of two very closely-allied\r\nspecies which cannot bear each other--not because they live upon nearly\r\nthe same food, as like cases are too often explained, but most probably\r\nbecause the passionate, eminently-individualist hare cannot make friends\r\nwith that placid, quiet, and submissive creature, the rabbit. Their\r\ntempers are too widely different not to be an obstacle to friendship.\r\n\r\nLife in societies is again the rule with the large family of horses,\r\nwhich includes the wild horses and donkeys of Asia, the zebras, the\r\nmustangs, the cimarrones of the Pampas, and the half-wild horses of\r\nMongolia and Siberia. They all live in numerous associations made up of\r\nmany studs, each of which consists of a number of mares under the\r\nleadership of a male. These numberless inhabitants of the Old and the\r\nNew World, badly organized on the whole for resisting both their\r\nnumerous enemies and the adverse conditions of climate, would soon have\r\ndisappeared from the surface of the earth were it not for their sociable\r\nspirit. When a beast of prey approaches them, several studs unite at\r\nonce; they repulse the beast and sometimes chase it: and neither the\r\nwolf nor the bear, not even the lion, can capture a horse or even a\r\nzebra as long as they are not detached from the herd. When a drought is\r\nburning the grass in the prairies, they gather in herds of sometimes\r\n10,000 individuals strong, and migrate. And when a snow-storm rages in\r\nthe Steppes, each stud keeps close together, and repairs to a protected\r\nravine. But if confidence disappears, or the group has been seized by\r\npanic, and disperses, the horses perish and the survivors are found\r\nafter the storm half dying from fatigue. Union is their chief arm in the\r\nstruggle for life, and man is their chief enemy. Before his increasing\r\nnumbers the ancestors of our domestic horse (the Equus Przewalskii, so\r\nnamed by Polyakoff) have preferred to retire to the wildest and least\r\naccessible plateaus on the outskirts of Thibet, where they continue to\r\nlive, surrounded by carnivores, under a climate as bad as that of the\r\nArctic regions, but in a region inaccessible to man.(18)\r\n\r\nMany striking illustrations of social life could be taken from the life\r\nof the reindeer, and especially of that large division of ruminants\r\nwhich might include the roebucks, the fallow deer, the antelopes, the\r\ngazelles, the ibex, and, in fact, the whole of the three numerous\r\nfamilies of the Antelopides, the Caprides, and the Ovides. Their\r\nwatchfulness over the safety of their herds against attacks of\r\ncarnivores; the anxiety displayed by all individuals in a herd of\r\nchamois as long as all of them have not cleared a difficult passage over\r\nrocky cliffs, the adoption of orphans; the despair of the gazelle whose\r\nmate, or even comrade of the same sex, has been killed; the plays of the\r\nyoungsters, and many other features, could be mentioned. But perhaps the\r\nmost striking illustration of mutual support is given by the occasional\r\nmigrations of fallow deer, such as I saw once on the Amur. When I\r\ncrossed the high plateau and its border ridge, the Great Khingan, on my\r\nway from Transbaikalia to Merghen, and further travelled over the high\r\nprairies on my way to the Amur, I could ascertain how thinly-peopled\r\nwith fallow deer these mostly uninhabited regions are.(19) Two years\r\nlater I was travelling up the Amur, and by the end of October reached\r\nthe lower end of that picturesque gorge which the Amur pierces in the\r\nDousse-alin (Little Khingan) before it enters the lowlands where it\r\njoins the Sungari. I found the Cossacks in the villages of that gorge in\r\nthe greatest excitement, because thousands and thousands of fallow deer\r\nwere crossing the Amur where it is narrowest, in order to reach the\r\nlowlands. For several days in succession, upon a length of some forty\r\nmiles up the river, the Cossacks were butchering the deer as they\r\ncrossed the Amur, in which already floated a good deal of ice. Thousands\r\nwere killed every day, and the exodus nevertheless continued. Like\r\nmigrations were never seen either before or since, and this one must\r\nhave been called for by an early and heavy snow-fall in the Great\r\nKhingan, which compelled the deer to make a desperate attempt at\r\nreaching the lowlands in the east of the Dousse mountains. Indeed, a few\r\ndays later the Dousse-alin was also buried under snow two or three feet\r\ndeep. Now, when one imagines the immense territory (almost as big as\r\nGreat Britain) from which the scattered groups of deer must have\r\ngathered for a migration which was undertaken under the pressure of\r\nexceptional circumstances, and realizes the difficulties which had to be\r\novercome before all the deer came to the common idea of crossing the\r\nAmur further south, where it is narrowest, one cannot but deeply admire\r\nthe amount of sociability displayed by these intelligent animals. The\r\nfact is not the less striking if we remember that the buffaloes of North\r\nAmerica displayed the same powers of combination. One saw them grazing\r\nin great numbers in the plains, but these numbers were made up by an\r\ninfinity of small groups which never mixed together. And yet, when\r\nnecessity arose, all groups, however scattered over an immense\r\nterritory, came together and made up those immense columns, numbering\r\nhundreds of thousands of individuals, which I mentioned on a preceding\r\npage.\r\n\r\nI also ought to say a few words at least about the \"compound families\"\r\nof the elephants, their mutual attachment, their deliberate ways in\r\nposting sentries, and the feelings of sympathy developed by such a life\r\nof close mutual support.(20) I might mention the sociable feelings of\r\nthose disreputable creatures the wild boars, and find a word of praise\r\nfor their powers of association in the case of an attack by a beast of\r\nprey.(21) The hippopotamus and the rhinoceros, too, would occupy a place\r\nin a work devoted to animal sociability. Several striking pages might be\r\ngiven to the sociability and mutual attachment of the seals and the\r\nwalruses; and finally, one might mention the most excellent feelings\r\nexisting among the sociable cetaceans. But I have to say yet a few words\r\nabout the societies of monkeys, which acquire an additional interest\r\nfrom their being the link which will bring us to the societies of\r\nprimitive men.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly needful to say that those mammals, which stand at the very\r\ntop of the animal world and most approach man by their structure and\r\nintelligence, are eminently sociable. Evidently we must be prepared to\r\nmeet with all varieties of character and habits in so great a division\r\nof the animal kingdom which includes hundreds of species. But, all\r\nthings considered, it must be said that sociability, action in common,\r\nmutual protection, and a high development of those feelings which are\r\nthe necessary outcome of social life, are characteristic of most monkeys\r\nand apes. From the smallest species to the biggest ones, sociability is\r\na rule to which we know but a few exceptions. The nocturnal apes prefer\r\nisolated life; the capuchins (Cebus capucinus), the monos, and the\r\nhowling monkeys live but in small families; and the orang-outans have\r\nnever been seen by A.R. Wallace otherwise than either solitary or in\r\nvery small groups of three or four individuals, while the gorillas seem\r\nnever to join in bands. But all the remainder of the monkey tribe--the\r\nchimpanzees, the sajous, the sakis, the mandrills, the baboons, and so\r\non--are sociable in the highest degree. They live in great bands, and\r\neven join with other species than their own. Most of them become quite\r\nunhappy when solitary. The cries of distress of each one of the band\r\nimmediately bring together the whole of the band, and they boldly\r\nrepulse the attacks of most carnivores and birds of prey. Even eagles do\r\nnot dare attack them. They plunder our fields always in bands--the old\r\nones taking care for the safety of the commonwealth. The little\r\ntee-tees, whose childish sweet faces so much struck Humboldt, embrace\r\nand protect one another when it rains, rolling their tails over the\r\nnecks of their shivering comrades. Several species display the greatest\r\nsolicitude for their wounded, and do not abandon a wounded comrade\r\nduring a retreat till they have ascertained that it is dead and that\r\nthey are helpless to restore it to life. Thus James Forbes narrated in\r\nhis Oriental Memoirs a fact of such resistance in reclaiming from his\r\nhunting party the dead body of a female monkey that one fully\r\nunderstands why \"the witnesses of this extraordinary scene resolved\r\nnever again to fire at one of the monkey race.\"(22) In some species\r\nseveral individuals will combine to overturn a stone in order to search\r\nfor ants' eggs under it. The hamadryas not only post sentries, but have\r\nbeen seen making a chain for the transmission of the spoil to a safe\r\nplace; and their courage is well known. Brehm's description of the\r\nregular fight which his caravan had to sustain before the hamadryas\r\nwould let it resume its journey in the valley of the Mensa, in\r\nAbyssinia, has become classical.(23) The playfulness of the tailed apes\r\nand the mutual attachment which reigns in the families of chimpanzees\r\nalso are familiar to the general reader. And if we find among the\r\nhighest apes two species, the orang-outan and the gorilla, which are not\r\nsociable, we must remember that both--limited as they are to very small\r\nareas, the one in the heart of Africa, and the other in the two islands\r\nof Borneo and Sumatra have all the appearance of being the last remnants\r\nof formerly much more numerous species. The gorilla at least seems to\r\nhave been sociable in olden times, if the apes mentioned in the Periplus\r\nreally were gorillas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe thus see, even from the above brief review, that life in societies is\r\nno exception in the animal world; it is the rule, the law of Nature, and\r\nit reaches its fullest development with the higher vertebrates. Those\r\nspecies which live solitary, or in small families only, are relatively\r\nfew, and their numbers are limited. Nay, it appears very probable that,\r\napart from a few exceptions, those birds and mammals which are not\r\ngregarious now, were living in societies before man multiplied on the\r\nearth and waged a permanent war against them, or destroyed the sources\r\nfrom which they formerly derived food. \"On ne s'associe pas pour\r\nmourir,\" was the sound remark of Espinas; and Houzeau, who knew the\r\nanimal world of some parts of America when it was not yet affected by\r\nman, wrote to the same effect.\r\n\r\nAssociation is found in the animal world at all degrees of evolution;\r\nand, according to the grand idea of Herbert Spencer, so brilliantly\r\ndeveloped in Perrier's Colonies Animales, colonies are at the very\r\norigin of evolution in the animal kingdom. But, in proportion as we\r\nascend the scale of evolution, we see association growing more and more\r\nconscious. It loses its purely physical character, it ceases to be\r\nsimply instinctive, it becomes reasoned. With the higher vertebrates it\r\nis periodical, or is resorted to for the satisfaction of a given\r\nwant--propagation of the species, migration, hunting, or mutual defence.\r\nIt even becomes occasional, when birds associate against a robber, or\r\nmammals combine, under the pressure of exceptional circumstances, to\r\nemigrate. In this last case, it becomes a voluntary deviation from\r\nhabitual moods of life. The combination sometimes appears in two or more\r\ndegrees--the family first, then the group, and finally the association\r\nof groups, habitually scattered, but uniting in case of need, as we saw\r\nit with the bisons and other ruminants. It also takes higher forms,\r\nguaranteeing more independence to the individual without depriving it of\r\nthe benefits of social life. With most rodents the individual has its\r\nown dwelling, which it can retire to when it prefers being left alone;\r\nbut the dwellings are laid out in villages and cities, so as to\r\nguarantee to all inhabitants the benefits and joys of social life. And\r\nfinally, in several species, such as rats, marmots, hares, etc.,\r\nsociable life is maintained notwithstanding the quarrelsome or otherwise\r\negotistic inclinations of the isolated individual. Thus it is not\r\nimposed, as is the case with ants and bees, by the very physiological\r\nstructure of the individuals; it is cultivated for the benefits of\r\nmutual aid, or for the sake of its pleasures. And this, of course,\r\nappears with all possible gradations and with the greatest variety of\r\nindividual and specific characters--the very variety of aspects taken by\r\nsocial life being a consequence, and for us a further proof, of its\r\ngenerality.(24)\r\n\r\nSociability--that is, the need of the animal of associating with its\r\nlike--the love of society for society's sake, combined with the \"joy of\r\nlife,\" only now begins to receive due attention from the zoologists.(25)\r\nWe know at the present time that all animals, beginning with the ants,\r\ngoing on to the birds, and ending with the highest mammals, are fond of\r\nplays, wrestling, running after each other, trying to capture each\r\nother, teasing each other, and so on. And while many plays are, so to\r\nspeak, a school for the proper behaviour of the young in mature life,\r\nthere are others, which, apart from their utilitarian purposes, are,\r\ntogether with dancing and singing, mere manifestations of an excess of\r\nforces--\"the joy of life,\" and a desire to communicate in some way or\r\nanother with other individuals of the same or of other species--in\r\nshort, a manifestation of sociability proper, which is a distinctive\r\nfeature of all the animal world.(26) Whether the feeling be fear,\r\nexperienced at the appearance of a bird of prey, or \"a fit of gladness\"\r\nwhich bursts out when the animals are in good health and especially when\r\nyoung, or merely the desire of giving play to an excess of impressions\r\nand of vital power--the necessity of communicating impressions, of\r\nplaying, of chattering, or of simply feeling the proximity of other\r\nkindred living beings pervades Nature, and is, as much as any other\r\nphysiological function, a distinctive feature of life and\r\nimpressionability. This need takes a higher development and attains a\r\nmore beautiful expression in mammals, especially amidst their young, and\r\nstill more among the birds; but it pervades all Nature, and has been\r\nfully observed by the best naturalists, including Pierre Huber, even\r\namongst the ants, and it is evidently the same instinct which brings\r\ntogether the big columns of butterflies which have been referred to\r\nalready.\r\n\r\nThe habit of coming together for dancing and of decorating the places\r\nwhere the birds habitually perform their dances is, of course, well\r\nknown from the pages that Darwin gave to this subject in The Descent of\r\nMan (ch. xiii). Visitors of the London Zoological Gardens also know the\r\nbower of the satin bower-bird. But this habit of dancing seems to be\r\nmuch more widely spread than was formerly believed, and Mr. W. Hudson\r\ngives in his master-work on La Plata the most interesting description,\r\nwhich must be read in the original, of complicated dances, performed by\r\nquite a number of birds: rails, jacanas, lapwings, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe habit of singing in concert, which exists in several species of\r\nbirds, belongs to the same category of social instincts. It is most\r\nstrikingly developed with the chakar (Chauna chavarris), to which the\r\nEnglish have given the most unimaginative misnomer of \"crested\r\nscreamer.\" These birds sometimes assemble in immense flocks, and in such\r\ncases they frequently sing all in concert. W.H. Hudson found them once\r\nin countless numbers, ranged all round a pampas lake in well-defined\r\nflocks, of about 500 birds in each flock.\r\n\r\n\"Presently,\" he writes, \"one flock near me began singing, and continued\r\ntheir powerful chant for three or four minutes; when they ceased the\r\nnext flock took up the strains, and after it the next, and so on, until\r\nonce more the notes of the flocks on the opposite shore came floating\r\nstrong and clear across the water--then passed away, growing fainter and\r\nfainter, until once more the sound approached me travelling round to my\r\nside again.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the same writer saw a whole plain covered with an\r\nendless flock of chakars, not in close order, but scattered in pairs and\r\nsmall groups. About nine o'clock in the evening, \"suddenly the entire\r\nmultitude of birds covering the marsh for miles around burst forth in a\r\ntremendous evening song.... It was a concert well worth riding a hundred\r\nmiles to hear.\"(27) It may be added that like all sociable animals, the\r\nchakar easily becomes tame and grows very attached to man. \"They are\r\nmild-tempered birds, and very rarely quarrel\"--we are told--although\r\nthey are well provided with formidable weapons. Life in societies\r\nrenders these weapons useless.\r\n\r\nThat life in societies is the most powerful weapon in the struggle for\r\nlife, taken in its widest sense, has been illustrated by several\r\nexamples on the foregoing pages, and could be illustrated by any amount\r\nof evidence, if further evidence were required. Life in societies\r\nenables the feeblest insects, the feeblest birds, and the feeblest\r\nmammals to resist, or to protect themselves from, the most terrible\r\nbirds and beasts of prey; it permits longevity; it enables the species\r\nto rear its progeny with the least waste of energy and to maintain its\r\nnumbers albeit a very slow birth-rate; it enables the gregarious animals\r\nto migrate in search of new abodes. Therefore, while fully admitting\r\nthat force, swiftness, protective colours, cunningness, and endurance to\r\nhunger and cold, which are mentioned by Darwin and Wallace, are so many\r\nqualities making the individual, or the species, the fittest under\r\ncertain circumstances, we maintain that under any circumstances\r\nsociability is the greatest advantage in the struggle for life. Those\r\nspecies which willingly or unwillingly abandon it are doomed to decay;\r\nwhile those animals which know best how to combine, have the greatest\r\nchances of survival and of further evolution, although they may be\r\ninferior to others in each of the faculties enumerated by Darwin and\r\nWallace, save the intellectual faculty. The highest vertebrates, and\r\nespecially mankind, are the best proof of this assertion. As to the\r\nintellectual faculty, while every Darwinist will agree with Darwin that\r\nit is the most powerful arm in the struggle for life, and the most\r\npowerful factor of further evolution, he also will admit that\r\nintelligence is an eminently social faculty. Language, imitation, and\r\naccumulated experience are so many elements of growing intelligence of\r\nwhich the unsociable animal is deprived. Therefore we find, at the top\r\nof each class of animals, the ants, the parrots, and the monkeys, all\r\ncombining the greatest sociability with the highest development of\r\nintelligence. The fittest are thus the most sociable animals, and\r\nsociability appears as the chief factor of evolution, both directly, by\r\nsecuring the well-being of the species while diminishing the waste of\r\nenergy, and indirectly, by favouring the growth of intelligence.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is evident that life in societies would be utterly\r\nimpossible without a corresponding development of social feelings, and,\r\nespecially, of a certain collective sense of justice growing to become a\r\nhabit. If every individual were constantly abusing its personal\r\nadvantages without the others interfering in favour of the wronged, no\r\nsociety--life would be possible. And feelings of justice develop, more\r\nor less, with all gregarious animals. Whatever the distance from which\r\nthe swallows or the cranes come, each one returns to the nest it has\r\nbuilt or repaired last year. If a lazy sparrow intends appropriating the\r\nnest which a comrade is building, or even steals from it a few sprays of\r\nstraw, the group interferes against the lazy comrade; and it is evident\r\nthat without such interference being the rule, no nesting associations\r\nof birds could exist. Separate groups of penguins have separate\r\nresting-places and separate fishing abodes, and do not fight for them.\r\nThe droves of cattle in Australia have particular spots to which each\r\ngroup repairs to rest, and from which it never deviates; and so on.(28)\r\nWe have any numbers of direct observations of the peace that prevails in\r\nthe nesting associations of birds, the villages of the rodents, and the\r\nherds of grass-eaters; while, on the other side, we know of few sociable\r\nanimals which so continually quarrel as the rats in our cellars do, or\r\nas the morses, which fight for the possession of a sunny place on the\r\nshore. Sociability thus puts a limit to physical struggle, and leaves\r\nroom for the development of better moral feelings. The high development\r\nof parental love in all classes of animals, even with lions and tigers,\r\nis generally known. As to the young birds and mammals whom we\r\ncontinually see associating, sympathy--not love--attains a further\r\ndevelopment in their associations. Leaving aside the really touching\r\nfacts of mutual attachment and compassion which have been recorded as\r\nregards domesticated animals and with animals kept in captivity, we have\r\na number of well certified facts of compassion between wild animals at\r\nliberty. Max Perty and L. Buchner have given a number of such facts.(29)\r\nJ.C. Wood's narrative of a weasel which came to pick up and to carry\r\naway an injured comrade enjoys a well-merited popularity.(30) So also\r\nthe observation of Captain Stansbury on his journey to Utah which is\r\nquoted by Darwin; he saw a blind pelican which was fed, and well fed, by\r\nother pelicans upon fishes which had to be brought from a distance of\r\nthirty miles.(31) And when a herd of vicunas was hotly pursued by\r\nhunters, H.A. Weddell saw more than once during his journey to Bolivia\r\nand Peru, the strong males covering the retreat of the herd and lagging\r\nbehind in order to protect the retreat. As to facts of compassion with\r\nwounded comrades, they are continually mentioned by all field\r\nzoologists. Such facts are quite natural. Compassion is a necessary\r\noutcome of social life. But compassion also means a considerable advance\r\nin general intelligence and sensibility. It is the first step towards\r\nthe development of higher moral sentiments. It is, in its turn, a\r\npowerful factor of further evolution.\r\n\r\nIf the views developed on the preceding pages are correct, the question\r\nnecessarily arises, in how far are they consistent with the theory of\r\nstruggle for life as it has been developed by Darwin, Wallace, and their\r\nfollowers? and I will now briefly answer this important question. First\r\nof all, no naturalist will doubt that the idea of a struggle for life\r\ncarried on through organic nature is the greatest generalization of our\r\ncentury. Life is struggle; and in that struggle the fittest survive. But\r\nthe answers to the questions, \"By which arms is this struggle chiefly\r\ncarried on?\" and \"Who are the fittest in the struggle?\" will widely\r\ndiffer according to the importance given to the two different aspects of\r\nthe struggle: the direct one, for food and safety among separate\r\nindividuals, and the struggle which Darwin described as\r\n\"metaphorical\"--the struggle, very often collective, against adverse\r\ncircumstances. No one will deny that there is, within each species, a\r\ncertain amount of real competition for food--at least, at certain\r\nperiods. But the question is, whether competition is carried on to the\r\nextent admitted by Darwin, or even by Wallace; and whether this\r\ncompetition has played, in the evolution of the animal kingdom, the part\r\nassigned to it.\r\n\r\nThe idea which permeates Darwin's work is certainly one of real\r\ncompetition going on within each animal group for food, safety, and\r\npossibility of leaving an offspring. He often speaks of regions being\r\nstocked with animal life to their full capacity, and from that\r\noverstocking he infers the necessity of competition. But when we look in\r\nhis work for real proofs of that competition, we must confess that we do\r\nnot find them sufficiently convincing. If we refer to the paragraph\r\nentitled \"Struggle for Life most severe between Individuals and\r\nVarieties of the same Species,\" we find in it none of that wealth of\r\nproofs and illustrations which we are accustomed to find in whatever\r\nDarwin wrote. The struggle between individuals of the same species is\r\nnot illustrated under that heading by even one single instance: it is\r\ntaken as granted; and the competition between closely-allied animal\r\nspecies is illustrated by but five examples, out of which one, at least\r\n(relating to the two species of thrushes), now proves to be\r\ndoubtful.(32) But when we look for more details in order to ascertain\r\nhow far the decrease of one species was really occasioned by the\r\nincrease of the other species, Darwin, with his usual fairness, tells\r\nus:\r\n\r\n\"We can dimly see why the competition should be most severe between\r\nallied forms which fill nearly the same place in nature; but probably in\r\nno case could we precisely say why one species has been victorious over\r\nanother in the great battle of life.\"\r\n\r\nAs to Wallace, who quotes the same facts under a slightly-modified\r\nheading (\"Struggle for Life between closely-allied Animals and Plants\r\noften most severe\"), he makes the following remark (italics are mine),\r\nwhich gives quite another aspect to the facts above quoted. He says:\r\n\r\n\"In some cases, no doubt, there is actual war between the two, the\r\nstronger killing the weaker. But this is by no means necessary, and\r\nthere may be cases in which the weaker species, physically, may prevail\r\nby its power of more rapid multiplication, its better withstanding\r\nvicissitudes of climate, or its greater cunning in escaping the attacks\r\nof common enemies.\"\r\n\r\nIn such cases what is described as competition may be no competition at\r\nall. One species succumbs, not because it is exterminated or starved out\r\nby the other species, but because it does not well accommodate itself to\r\nnew conditions, which the other does. The term \"struggle for life\" is\r\nagain used in its metaphorical sense, and may have no other. As to the\r\nreal competition between individuals of the same species, which is\r\nillustrated in another place by the cattle of South America during a\r\nperiod of drought, its value is impaired by its being taken from among\r\ndomesticated animals. Bisons emigrate in like circumstances in order to\r\navoid competition. However severe the struggle between plants--and this\r\nis amply proved--we cannot but repeat Wallace's remark to the effect\r\nthat \"plants live where they can,\" while animals have, to a great\r\nextent, the power of choice of their abode. So that we again are asking\r\nourselves, To what extent does competition really exist within each\r\nanimal species? Upon what is the assumption based? The same remark must\r\nbe made concerning the indirect argument in favour of a severe\r\ncompetition and struggle for life within each species, which may be\r\nderived from the \"extermination of transitional varieties,\" so often\r\nmentioned by Darwin. It is known that for a long time Darwin was worried\r\nby the difficulty which he saw in the absence of a long chain of\r\nintermediate forms between closely-allied species, and that he found the\r\nsolution of this difficulty in the supposed extermination of the\r\nintermediate forms.(33) However, an attentive reading of the different\r\nchapters in which Darwin and Wallace speak of this subject soon brings\r\none to the conclusion that the word \"extermination\" does not mean real\r\nextermination; the same remark which Darwin made concerning his\r\nexpression: \"struggle for existence,\" evidently applies to the word\r\n\"extermination\" as well. It can by no means be understood in its direct\r\nsense, but must be taken \"in its metaphoric sense.\" If we start from the\r\nsupposition that a given area is stocked with animals to its fullest\r\ncapacity, and that a keen competition for the sheer means of existence\r\nis consequently going on between all the inhabitants--each animal being\r\ncompelled to fight against all its congeners in order to get its daily\r\nfood--then the appearance of a new and successful variety would\r\ncertainly mean in many cases (though not always) the appearance of\r\nindividuals which are enabled to seize more than their fair share of the\r\nmeans of existence; and the result would be that those individuals would\r\nstarve both the parental form which does not possess the new variation\r\nand the intermediate forms which do not possess it in the same degree.\r\nIt may be that at the outset, Darwin understood the appearance of new\r\nvarieties under this aspect; at least, the frequent use of the word\r\n\"extermination\" conveys such an impression. But both he and Wallace knew\r\nNature too well not to perceive that this is by no means the only\r\npossible and necessary course of affairs.\r\n\r\nIf the physical and the biological conditions of a given area, the\r\nextension of the area occupied by a given species, and the habits of all\r\nthe members of the latter remained unchanged--then the sudden appearance\r\nof a new variety might mean the starving out and the extermination of\r\nall the individuals which were not endowed in a sufficient degree with\r\nthe new feature by which the new variety is characterized. But such a\r\ncombination of conditions is precisely what we do not see in Nature.\r\nEach species is continually tending to enlarge its abode; migration to\r\nnew abodes is the rule with the slow snail, as with the swift bird;\r\nphysical changes are continually going on in every given area; and new\r\nvarieties among animals consist in an immense number of cases-perhaps in\r\nthe majority--not in the growth of new weapons for snatching the food\r\nfrom the mouth of its congeners--food is only one out of a hundred of\r\nvarious conditions of existence--but, as Wallace himself shows in a\r\ncharming paragraph on the \"divergence of characters\" (Darwinism, p.\r\n107), in forming new habits, moving to new abodes, and taking to new\r\nsorts of food. In all such cases there will be no extermination, even no\r\ncompetition--the new adaptation being a relief from competition, if it\r\never existed; and yet there will be, after a time, an absence of\r\nintermediate links, in consequence of a mere survival of those which are\r\nbest fitted for the new conditions--as surely as under the hypothesis of\r\nextermination of the parental form. It hardly need be added that if we\r\nadmit, with Spencer, all the Lamarckians, and Darwin himself, the\r\nmodifying influence of the surroundings upon the species, there remains\r\nstill less necessity for the extermination of the intermediate forms.\r\n\r\nThe importance of migration and of the consequent isolation of groups of\r\nanimals, for the origin of new varieties and ultimately of new species,\r\nwhich was indicated by Moritz Wagner, was fully recognized by Darwin\r\nhimself. Consequent researches have only accentuated the importance of\r\nthis factor, and they have shown how the largeness of the area occupied\r\nby a given species--which Darwin considered with full reason so\r\nimportant for the appearance of new varieties--can be combined with the\r\nisolation of parts of the species, in consequence of local geological\r\nchanges, or of local barriers. It would be impossible to enter here into\r\nthe discussion of this wide question, but a few remarks will do to\r\nillustrate the combined action of these agencies. It is known that\r\nportions of a given species will often take to a new sort of food. The\r\nsquirrels, for instance, when there is a scarcity of cones in the larch\r\nforests, remove to the fir-tree forests, and this change of food has\r\ncertain well-known physiological effects on the squirrels. If this\r\nchange of habits does not last--if next year the cones are again\r\nplentiful in the dark larch woods--no new variety of squirrels will\r\nevidently arise from this cause. But if part of the wide area occupied\r\nby the squirrels begins to have its physical characters altered--in\r\nconsequence of, let us say, a milder climate or desiccation, which both\r\nbring about an increase of the pine forests in proportion to the larch\r\nwoods--and if some other conditions concur to induce the squirrels to\r\ndwell on the outskirts of the desiccating region--we shall have then a\r\nnew variety, i.e. an incipient new species of squirrels, without there\r\nhaving been anything that would deserve the name of extermination among\r\nthe squirrels. A larger proportion of squirrels of the new, better\r\nadapted variety would survive every year, and the intermediate links\r\nwould die in the course of time, without having been starved out by\r\nMalthusian competitors. This is exactly what we see going on during the\r\ngreat physical changes which are accomplished over large areas in\r\nCentral Asia, owing to the desiccation which is going on there since the\r\nglacial period.\r\n\r\nTo take another example, it has been proved by geologists that the\r\npresent wild horse (Equus Przewalski) has slowly been evolved during the\r\nlater parts of the Tertiary and the Quaternary period, but that during\r\nthis succession of ages its ancestors were not confined to some given,\r\nlimited area of the globe. They wandered over both the Old and New\r\nWorld, returning, in all probability, after a time to the pastures which\r\nthey had, in the course of their migrations, formerly left.(34)\r\nConsequently, if we do not find now, in Asia, all the intermediate links\r\nbetween the present wild horse and its Asiatic Post-Tertiary ancestors,\r\nthis does not mean at all that the intermediate links have been\r\nexterminated. No such extermination has ever taken place. No exceptional\r\nmortality may even have occurred among the ancestral species: the\r\nindividuals which belonged to intermediate varieties and species have\r\ndied in the usual course of events--often amidst plentiful food, and\r\ntheir remains were buried all over the globe.\r\n\r\nIn short, if we carefully consider this matter, and, carefully re-read\r\nwhat Darwin himself wrote upon this subject, we see that if the word\r\n\"extermination\" be used at all in connection with transitional\r\nvarieties, it must be used in its metaphoric sense. As to \"competition,\"\r\nthis expression, too, is continually used by Darwin (see, for instance,\r\nthe paragraph \"On Extinction\") as an image, or as a way-of-speaking,\r\nrather than with the intention of conveying the idea of a real\r\ncompetition between two portions of the same species for the means of\r\nexistence. At any rate, the absence of intermediate forms is no argument\r\nin favour of it.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the chief argument in favour of a keen competition for the\r\nmeans of existence continually going on within every animal species\r\nis--to use Professor Geddes' expression--the \"arithmetical argument\"\r\nborrowed from Malthus.\r\n\r\nBut this argument does not prove it at all. We might as well take a\r\nnumber of villages in South-East Russia, the inhabitants of which enjoy\r\nplenty of food, but have no sanitary accommodation of any kind; and\r\nseeing that for the last eighty years the birth-rate was sixty in the\r\nthousand, while the population is now what it was eighty years ago, we\r\nmight conclude that there has been a terrible competition between the\r\ninhabitants. But the truth is that from year to year the population\r\nremained stationary, for the simple reason that one-third of the\r\nnew-born died before reaching their sixth month of life; one-half died\r\nwithin the next four years, and out of each hundred born, only seventeen\r\nor so reached the age of twenty. The new-comers went away before having\r\ngrown to be competitors. It is evident that if such is the case with\r\nmen, it is still more the case with animals. In the feathered world the\r\ndestruction of the eggs goes on on such a tremendous scale that eggs are\r\nthe chief food of several species in the early summer; not to, say a\r\nword of the storms, the inundations which destroy nests by the million\r\nin America, and the sudden changes of weather which are fatal to the\r\nyoung mammals. Each storm, each inundation, each visit of a rat to a\r\nbird's nest, each sudden change of temperature, take away those\r\ncompetitors which appear so terrible in theory.\r\n\r\nAs to the facts of an extremely rapid increase of horses and cattle in\r\nAmerica, of pigs and rabbits in New Zealand, and even of wild animals\r\nimported from Europe (where their numbers are kept down by man, not by\r\ncompetition), they rather seem opposed to the theory of over-population.\r\nIf horses and cattle could so rapidly multiply in America, it simply\r\nproved that, however numberless the buffaloes and other ruminants were\r\nat that time in the New World, its grass-eating population was far below\r\nwhat the prairies could maintain. If millions of intruders have found\r\nplenty of food without starving out the former population of the\r\nprairies, we must rather conclude that the Europeans found a want of\r\ngrass-eaters in America, not an excess. And we have good reasons to\r\nbelieve that want of animal population is the natural state of things\r\nall over the world, with but a few temporary exceptions to the rule. The\r\nactual numbers of animals in a given region are determined, not by the\r\nhighest feeding capacity of the region, but by what it is every year\r\nunder the most unfavourable conditions. So that, for that reason alone,\r\ncompetition hardly can be a normal condition. But other causes intervene\r\nas well to cut, down the animal population below even that low standard.\r\nIf we take the horses and cattle which are grazing all the winter\r\nthrough in the Steppes of Transbaikalia, we find them very lean and\r\nexhausted at the end of the winter. But they grow exhausted not because\r\nthere is not enough food for all of them--the grass buried under a thin\r\nsheet of snow is everywhere in abundance--but because of the difficulty\r\nof getting it from beneath the snow, and this difficulty is the same for\r\nall horses alike. Besides, days of glazed frost are common in early\r\nspring, and if several such days come in succession the horses grow\r\nstill more exhausted. But then comes a snow-storm, which compels the\r\nalready weakened animals to remain without any food for several days,\r\nand very great numbers of them die. The losses during the spring are so\r\nsevere that if the season has been more inclement than usual they are\r\neven not repaired by the new breeds--the more so as all horses are\r\nexhausted, and the young foals are born in a weaker condition. The\r\nnumbers of horses and cattle thus always remain beneath what they\r\notherwise might be; all the year round there is food for five or ten\r\ntimes as many animals, and yet their population increases extremely\r\nslowly. But as soon as the Buriate owner makes ever so small a provision\r\nof hay in the steppe, and throws it open during days of glazed frost, or\r\nheavier snow-fall, he immediately sees the increase of his herd. Almost\r\nall free grass-eating animals and many rodents in Asia and America being\r\nin very much the same conditions, we can safely say that their numbers\r\nare not kept down by competition; that at no time of the year they can\r\nstruggle for food, and that if they never reach anything approaching to\r\nover-population, the cause is in the climate, not in competition.\r\n\r\nThe importance of natural checks to over-multiplication, and especially\r\ntheir bearing upon the competition hypothesis, seems never to have been\r\ntaken into due account. The checks, or rather some of them, are\r\nmentioned, but their action is seldom studied in detail. However, if we\r\ncompare the action of the natural checks with that of competition, we\r\nmust recognize at once that the latter sustains no comparison whatever\r\nwith the other checks. Thus, Mr. Bates mentions the really astounding\r\nnumbers of winged ants which are destroyed during their exodus. The dead\r\nor half-dead bodies of the formica de fuego (Myrmica saevissima) which\r\nhad been blown into the river during a gale \"were heaped in a line an\r\ninch or two in height and breadth, the line continuing without\r\ninterruption for miles at the edge of the water.\"(35) Myriads of ants\r\nare thus destroyed amidst a nature which might support a hundred times\r\nas many ants as are actually living. Dr. Altum, a German forester, who\r\nwrote a very interesting book about animals injurious to our forests,\r\nalso gives many facts showing the immense importance of natural checks.\r\nHe says, that a succession of gales or cold and damp weather during the\r\nexodus of the pine-moth (Bombyx pini) destroy it to incredible amounts,\r\nand during the spring of 1871 all these moths disappeared at once,\r\nprobably killed by a succession of cold nights.(36) Many like examples\r\nrelative to various insects could be quoted from various parts of\r\nEurope. Dr. Altum also mentions the bird-enemies of the pine-moth, and\r\nthe immense amount of its eggs destroyed by foxes; but he adds that the\r\nparasitic fungi which periodically infest it are a far more terrible\r\nenemy than any bird, because they destroy the moth over very large areas\r\nat once. As to various species of mice (Mus sylvaticus, Arvicola\r\narvalis, and A. agrestis), the same author gives a long list of their\r\nenemies, but he remarks: \"However, the most terrible enemies of mice are\r\nnot other animals, but such sudden changes of weather as occur almost\r\nevery year.\" Alternations of frost and warm weather destroy them in\r\nnumberless quantities; \"one single sudden change can reduce thousands of\r\nmice to the number of a few individuals.\" On the other side, a warm\r\nwinter, or a winter which gradually steps in, make them multiply in\r\nmenacing proportions, notwithstanding every enemy; such was the case in\r\n1876 and 1877.(37) Competition, in the case of mice, thus appears a\r\nquite trifling factor when compared with weather. Other facts to the\r\nsame effect are also given as regards squirrels.\r\n\r\nAs to birds, it is well known how they suffer from sudden changes of\r\nweather. Late snow-storms are as destructive of bird-life on the English\r\nmoors, as they are in Siberia; and Ch. Dixon saw the red grouse so\r\npressed during some exceptionally severe winters, that they quitted the\r\nmoors in numbers, \"and we have then known them actually to be taken in\r\nthe streets of Sheffield. Persistent wet,\" he adds, \"is almost as fatal\r\nto them.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the contagious diseases which continually visit most\r\nanimal species destroy them in such numbers that the losses often cannot\r\nbe repaired for many years, even with the most rapidly-multiplying\r\nanimals. Thus, some sixty years ago, the sousliks suddenly disappeared\r\nin the neighbourhood of Sarepta, in South-Eastern Russia, in consequence\r\nof some epidemics; and for years no sousliks were seen in that\r\nneighbourhood. It took many years before they became as numerous as they\r\nformerly were.(38)\r\n\r\nLike facts, all tending to reduce the importance given to competition,\r\ncould be produced in numbers. Of course, it might be replied, in\r\nDarwin's words, that nevertheless each organic being \"at some period of\r\nits life, during some season of the year, during each generation or at\r\nintervals, has to struggle for life and to suffer great destruction,\"\r\nand that the fittest survive during such periods of hard struggle for\r\nlife. But if the evolution of the animal world were based exclusively,\r\nor even chiefly, upon the survival of the fittest during periods of\r\ncalamities; if natural selection were limited in its action to periods\r\nof exceptional drought, or sudden changes of temperature, or\r\ninundations, retrogression would be the rule in the animal world. Those\r\nwho survive a famine, or a severe epidemic of cholera, or small-pox, or\r\ndiphtheria, such as we see them in uncivilized countries, are neither\r\nthe strongest, nor the healthiest, nor the most intelligent. No progress\r\ncould be based on those survivals--the less so as all survivors usually\r\ncome out of the ordeal with an impaired health, like the Transbaikalian\r\nhorses just mentioned, or the Arctic crews, or the garrison of a\r\nfortress which has been compelled to live for a few months on half\r\nrations, and comes out of its experience with a broken health, and\r\nsubsequently shows a quite abnormal mortality. All that natural\r\nselection can do in times of calamities is to spare the individuals\r\nendowed with the greatest endurance for privations of all kinds. So it\r\ndoes among the Siberian horses and cattle. They are enduring; they can\r\nfeed upon the Polar birch in case of need; they resist cold and hunger.\r\nBut no Siberian horse is capable of carrying half the weight which a\r\nEuropean horse carries with ease; no Siberian cow gives half the amount\r\nof milk given by a Jersey cow, and no natives of uncivilized countries\r\ncan bear a comparison with Europeans. They may better endure hunger and\r\ncold, but their physical force is very far below that of a well-fed\r\nEuropean, and their intellectual progress is despairingly slow. \"Evil\r\ncannot be productive of good,\" as Tchernyshevsky wrote in a remarkable\r\nessay upon Darwinism.(39)\r\n\r\nHappily enough, competition is not the rule either in the animal world\r\nor in mankind. It is limited among animals to exceptional periods, and\r\nnatural selection finds better fields for its activity. Better\r\nconditions are created by the elimination of competition by means of\r\nmutual aid and mutual Support.(40) In the great struggle for life--for\r\nthe greatest possible fulness and intensity of life with the least waste\r\nof energy--natural selection continually seeks out the ways precisely\r\nfor avoiding competition as much as possible. The ants combine in nests\r\nand nations; they pile up their stores, they rear their cattle--and thus\r\navoid competition; and natural selection picks out of the ants' family\r\nthe species which know best how to avoid competition, with its\r\nunavoidably deleterious consequences. Most of our birds slowly move\r\nsouthwards as the winter comes, or gather in numberless societies and\r\nundertake long journeys--and thus avoid competition. Many rodents fall\r\nasleep when the time comes that competition should set in; while other\r\nrodents store food for the winter, and gather in large villages for\r\nobtaining the necessary protection when at work. The reindeer, when the\r\nlichens are dry in the interior of the continent, migrate towards the\r\nsea. Buffaloes cross an immense continent in order to find plenty of\r\nfood. And the beavers, when they grow numerous on a river, divide into\r\ntwo parties, and go, the old ones down the river, and the young ones up\r\nthe river and avoid competition. And when animals can neither fall\r\nasleep, nor migrate, nor lay in stores, nor themselves grow their food\r\nlike the ants, they do what the titmouse does, and what Wallace\r\n(Darwinism, ch. v) has so charmingly described: they resort to new kinds\r\nof food--and thus, again, avoid competition.\r\n\r\n\"Don't compete!--competition is always injurious to the species, and you\r\nhave plenty of resources to avoid it!\" That is the tendency of nature,\r\nnot always realized in full, but always present. That is the watchword\r\nwhich comes to us from the bush, the forest, the river, the ocean.\r\n\"Therefore combine--practise mutual aid! That is the surest means for\r\ngiving to each and to all the greatest safety, the best guarantee of\r\nexistence and progress, bodily, intellectual, and moral.\" That is what\r\nNature teaches us; and that is what all those animals which have\r\nattained the highest position in their respective classes have done.\r\nThat is also what man--the most primitive man--has been doing; and that\r\nis why man has reached the position upon which we stand now, as we shall\r\nsee in the subsequent chapters devoted to mutual aid in human societies.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1.

All birds rose in such case and\r\nattacked the enemy with great vigour. The females, which had five or six\r\nnests together on each knoll of the marsh, kept a certain order in\r\nleaving their nests in search of food. The fledglings, which otherwise\r\nare extremely unprotected and easily become the prey of the rapacious\r\nbirds, were never left alone (\"Family Habits among the Aquatic Birds,\"\r\nin Proceedings of the Zool.

It has often been intimated that larger birds may occasionally\r\ntransport some of the smaller birds when they cross together the\r\nMediterranean, but the fact still remains doubtful. On the other side,\r\nit is certain that some smaller birds join the bigger ones for\r\nmigration. The fact has been noticed several times, and it was recently\r\nconfirmed by L. Buxbaum at Raunheim. He saw several parties of cranes\r\nwhich had larks flying in the midst and on both sides of their migratory\r\ncolumns (Der zoologische Garten, 1886, p. 133).\r\n\r\n8. H. Seebohm and Ch.

With regard to the viscacha it is very interesting to note that\r\nthese highly-sociable little animals not only live peaceably together in\r\neach village, but that whole villages visit each other at nights.\r\nSociability is thus extended to the whole species--not only to a given\r\nsociety, or to a nation, as we saw it with the ants. When the farmer\r\ndestroys a viscacha-burrow, and buries the inhabitants under a heap of\r\nearth, other viscachas--we are told by Hudson--\"come from a distance to\r\ndig out those that are buried alive\" (l.c., p. 311). This is a\r\nwidely-known fact in La Plata, verified by the author.\r\n\r\n16. Handbuch für Jäger und Jagdberechtigte, quoted by Brehm, ii. 223.\r\n\r\n17. Buffon's Histoire Naturelle.\r\n\r\n18. In connection with the horses it is worthy of notice that the quagga\r\nzebra, which never comes together with the dauw zebra, nevertheless\r\nlives on excellent terms, not only with ostriches, which are very good\r\nsentries, but also with gazelles, several species of antelopes, and\r\ngnus. We thus have a case of mutual dislike between the quagga and the\r\ndauw which cannot be explained by competition for food. The fact that\r\nthe quagga lives together with ruminants feeding on the same grass as\r\nitself excludes that hypothesis, and we must look for some\r\nincompatibility of character, as in the case of the hare and the rabbit.\r\nCf., among others, Clive Phillips-Wolley's Big Game Shooting (Badminton\r\nLibrary), which contains excellent illustrations of various species\r\nliving together in East Africa.\r\n\r\n19. Our Tungus hunter, who was going to marry, and therefore was\r\nprompted by the desire of getting as many furs as he possibly could, was\r\nbeating the hill-sides all day long on horseback in search of deer. His\r\nefforts were not rewarded by even so much as one fallow deer killed\r\nevery day; and he was an excellent hunter.\r\n\r\n20. According to Samuel W. Baker, elephants combine in larger groups\r\nthan the \"compound family.\" \"I have frequently observed,\" he wrote, \"in\r\nthe portion of Ceylon known as the Park Country, the tracks of elephants\r\nin great numbers which have evidently been considerable herds that have\r\njoined together in a general retreat from a ground which they considered\r\ninsecure\" (Wild Beasts and their Ways, vol. i. p. 102).\r\n\r\n21.

The more strange was it to read in the previously-mentioned article\r\nby Huxley the following paraphrase of a well-known sentence of Rousseau:\r\n\"The first men who substituted mutual peace for that of mutual\r\nwar--whatever the motive which impelled them to take that step--created\r\nsociety\" (Nineteenth Century, Feb. 1888, p. 165). Society has not been\r\ncreated by man; it is anterior to man.\r\n\r\n25. Such monographs as the chapter on \"Music and Dancing in Nature\"\r\nwhich we have in Hudson's Naturalist on the La Plata, and Carl Gross'\r\nPlay of Animals, have already thrown a considerable light upon an\r\ninstinct which is absolutely universal in Nature.\r\n\r\n26. Not only numerous species of birds possess the habit of assembling\r\ntogether--in many cases always at the same spot--to indulge in antics\r\nand dancing performances, but W.H. Hudson's experience is that nearly\r\nall mammals and birds (\"probably there are really no exceptions\")\r\nindulge frequently in more or less regular or set performances with or\r\nwithout sound, or composed of sound exclusively (p. 264).\r\n\r\n27.

One species of swallow is said to have caused the decrease of\r\nanother swallow species in North America; the recent increase of the\r\nmissel-thrush in Scotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush;\r\nthe brown rat has taken the place of the black rat in Europe; in Russia\r\nthe small cockroach has everywhere driven before it its greater\r\ncongener; and in Australia the imported hive-bee is rapidly\r\nexterminating the small stingless bee. Two other cases, but relative to\r\ndomesticated animals, are mentioned in the preceding paragraph. While\r\nrecalling these same facts, A.R. Wallace remarks in a footnote relative\r\nto the Scottish thrushes: \"Prof. A. Newton, however, informs me that\r\nthese species do not interfere in the way here stated\" (Darwinism, p.\r\n34). As to the brown rat, it is known that, owing to its amphibian\r\nhabits, it usually stays in the lower parts of human dwellings (low\r\ncellars, sewers, etc.), as also on the banks of canals and rivers; it\r\nalso undertakes distant migrations in numberless bands. The black rat,\r\non the contrary, prefers staying in our dwellings themselves, under the\r\nfloor, as well as in our stables and barns. It thus is much more exposed\r\nto be exterminated by man; and we cannot maintain, with any approach to\r\ncertainty, that the black rat is being either exterminated or starved\r\nout by the brown rat and not by man.\r\n\r\n33. \"But it may be urged that when several closely-allied species\r\ninhabit the same territory, we surely ought to find at the present time\r\nmany transitional forms.... By my theory these allied species are\r\ndescended from a common parent; and during the process of modification,\r\neach has become adapted to the conditions of life of its own region, and\r\nhas supplanted and exterminated its original parent-form and all the\r\ntransitional varieties between its past and present states\" (Origin of\r\nSpecies, 6th ed. p. 134); also p. 137, 296 (all paragraph \"On\r\nExtinction\").\r\n\r\n34. According to Madame Marie Pavloff, who has made a special study of\r\nthis subject, they migrated from Asia to Africa, stayed there some time,\r\nand returned next to Asia. Whether this double migration be confirmed or\r\nnot, the fact of a former extension of the ancestor of our horse over\r\nAsia, Africa, and America is settled beyond doubt.\r\n\r\n35.

Tribal origin of human society. Late\r\nappearance of the separate family. Bushmen and Hottentots. Australians,\r\nPapuas. Eskimos, Aleoutes. Features of savage life difficult to\r\nunderstand for the European. The Dayak's conception of justice. Common\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immense part played by mutual aid and mutual support in the\r\nevolution of the animal world has been briefly analyzed in the preceding\r\nchapters. We have now to cast a glance upon the part played by the same\r\nagencies in the evolution of mankind. We saw how few are the animal\r\nspecies which live an isolated life, and how numberless are those which\r\nlive in societies, either for mutual defence, or for hunting and storing\r\nup food, or for rearing their offspring, or simply for enjoying life in\r\ncommon. We also saw that, though a good deal of warfare goes on between\r\ndifferent classes of animals, or different species, or even different\r\ntribes of the same species, peace and mutual support are the rule within\r\nthe tribe or the species; and that those species which best know how to\r\ncombine, and to avoid competition, have the best chances of survival and\r\nof a further progressive development. They prosper, while the unsociable\r\nspecies decay.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that it would be quite contrary to all that we know of\r\nnature if men were an exception to so general a rule: if a creature so\r\ndefenceless as man was at his beginnings should have found his\r\nprotection and his way to progress, not in mutual support, like other\r\nanimals, but in a reckless competition for personal advantages, with no\r\nregard to the interests of the species. To a mind accustomed to the idea\r\nof unity in nature, such a proposition appears utterly indefensible. And\r\nyet, improbable and unphilosophical as it is, it has never found a lack\r\nof supporters. There always were writers who took a pessimistic view of\r\nmankind. They knew it, more or less superficially, through their own\r\nlimited experience; they knew of history what the annalists, always\r\nwatchful of wars, cruelty, and oppression, told of it, and little more\r\nbesides; and they concluded that mankind is nothing but a loose\r\naggregation of beings, always ready to fight with each other, and only\r\nprevented from so doing by the intervention of some authority.\r\n\r\nHobbes took that position; and while some of his eighteenth-century\r\nfollowers endeavoured to prove that at no epoch of its existence--not\r\neven in its most primitive condition--mankind lived in a state of\r\nperpetual warfare; that men have been sociable even in \"the state of\r\nnature,\" and that want of knowledge, rather than the natural bad\r\ninclinations of man, brought humanity to all the horrors of its early\r\nhistorical life,--his idea was, on the contrary, that the so-called\r\n\"state of nature\" was nothing but a permanent fight between individuals,\r\naccidentally huddled together by the mere caprice of their bestial\r\nexistence. True, that science has made some progress since Hobbes's\r\ntime, and that we have safer ground to stand upon than the speculations\r\nof Hobbes or Rousseau. But the Hobbesian philosophy has plenty of\r\nadmirers still; and we have had of late quite a school of writers who,\r\ntaking possession of Darwin's terminology rather than of his leading\r\nideas, made of it an argument in favour of Hobbes's views upon primitive\r\nman, and even succeeded in giving them a scientific appearance. Huxley,\r\nas is known, took the lead of that school, and in a paper written in\r\n1888 he represented primitive men as a sort of tigers or lions, deprived\r\nof all ethical conceptions, fighting out the struggle for existence to\r\nits bitter end, and living a life of \"continual free fight\"; to quote\r\nhis own words--\"beyond the limited and, temporary relations of the\r\nfamily, the Hobbesian war of each against all was the normal state of\r\nexistence.\"(1)\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked more than once that the chief error of Hobbes, and\r\nthe eighteenth-century philosophers as well, was to imagine that mankind\r\nbegan its life in the shape of small straggling families, something like\r\nthe \"limited and temporary\" families of the bigger carnivores, while in\r\nreality it is now positively known that such was not the case. Of\r\ncourse, we have no direct evidence as to the modes of life of the first\r\nman-like beings. We are not yet settled even as to the time of their\r\nfirst appearance, geologists being inclined at present to see their\r\ntraces in the pliocene, or even the miocene, deposits of the Tertiary\r\nperiod. But we have the indirect method which permits us to throw some\r\nlight even upon that remote antiquity. A most careful investigation into\r\nthe social institutions of the lowest races has been carried on during\r\nthe last forty years, and it has revealed among the present institutions\r\nof primitive folk some traces of still older institutions which have\r\nlong disappeared, but nevertheless left unmistakable traces of their\r\nprevious existence. A whole science devoted to the embryology of human\r\ninstitutions has thus developed in the hands of Bachofen, MacLennan,\r\nMorgan, Edwin Tylor, Maine, Post, Kovalevsky, Lubbock, and many others.\r\nAnd that science has established beyond any doubt that mankind did not\r\nbegin its life in the shape of small isolated families.\r\n\r\nFar from being a primitive form of organization, the family is a very\r\nlate product of human evolution. As far as we can go back in the\r\npalaeo-ethnology of mankind, we find men living in societies--in tribes\r\nsimilar to those of the highest mammals; and an extremely slow and long\r\nevolution was required to bring these societies to the gentile, or clan\r\norganization, which, in its turn, had to undergo another, also very long\r\nevolution, before the first germs of family, polygamous or monogamous,\r\ncould appear. Societies, bands, or tribes--not families--were thus the\r\nprimitive form of organization of mankind and its earliest ancestors.\r\nThat is what ethnology has come to after its painstaking researches. And\r\nin so doing it simply came to what might have been foreseen by the\r\nzoologist. None of the higher mammals, save a few carnivores and a few\r\nundoubtedly-decaying species of apes (orang-outans and gorillas), live\r\nin small families, isolatedly straggling in the woods. All others live\r\nin societies. And Darwin so well understood that isolately-living apes\r\nnever could have developed into man-like beings, that he was inclined to\r\nconsider man as descended from some comparatively weak but social\r\nspecies, like the chimpanzee, rather than from some stronger but\r\nunsociable species, like the gorilla.(2) Zoology and palaeo-ethnology\r\nare thus agreed in considering that the band, not the family, was the\r\nearliest form of social life. The first human societies simply were a\r\nfurther development of those societies which constitute the very essence\r\nof life of the higher animals.(3)\r\n\r\nIf we now go over to positive evidence, we see that the earliest traces\r\nof man, dating from the glacial or the early post-glacial period, afford\r\nunmistakable proofs of man having lived even then in societies. Isolated\r\nfinds of stone implements, even from the old stone age, are very rare;\r\non the contrary, wherever one flint implement is discovered others are\r\nsure to be found, in most cases in very large quantities. At a time when\r\nmen were dwelling in caves, or under occasionally protruding rocks, in\r\ncompany with mammals now extinct, and hardly succeeded in making the\r\nroughest sorts of flint hatchets, they already knew the advantages of\r\nlife in societies. In the valleys of the tributaries of the Dordogne,\r\nthe surface of the rocks is in some places entirely covered with caves\r\nwhich were inhabited by palaeolithic men.(4) Sometimes the\r\ncave-dwellings are superposed in storeys, and they certainly recall much\r\nmore the nesting colonies of swallows than the dens of carnivores. As to\r\nthe flint implements discovered in those caves, to use Lubbock's words,\r\n\"one may say without exaggeration that they are numberless.\" The same is\r\ntrue of other palaeolithic stations. It also appears from Lartet's\r\ninvestigations that the inhabitants of the Aurignac region in the south\r\nof France partook of tribal meals at the burial of their dead. So that\r\nmen lived in societies, and had germs of a tribal worship, even at that\r\nextremely remote epoch.\r\n\r\nThe same is still better proved as regards the later part of the stone\r\nage. Traces of neolithic man have been found in numberless quantities,\r\nso that we can reconstitute his manner of life to a great extent. When\r\nthe ice-cap (which must have spread from the Polar regions as far south\r\nas middle France, middle Germany, and middle Russia, and covered Canada\r\nas well as a good deal of what is now the United States) began to melt\r\naway, the surfaces freed from ice were covered, first, with swamps and\r\nmarshes, and later on with numberless lakes.(5) Lakes filled all\r\ndepressions of the valleys before their waters dug out those permanent\r\nchannels which, during a subsequent epoch, became our rivers. And\r\nwherever we explore, in Europe, Asia, or America, the shores of the\r\nliterally numberless lakes of that period, whose proper name would be\r\nthe Lacustrine period, we find traces of neolithic man. They are so\r\nnumerous that we can only wonder at the relative density of population\r\nat that time. The \"stations\" of neolithic man closely follow each other\r\non the terraces which now mark the shores of the old lakes. And at each\r\nof those stations stone implements appear in such numbers, that no doubt\r\nis possible as to the length of time during which they were inhabited by\r\nrather numerous tribes. Whole workshops of flint implements, testifying\r\nof the numbers of workers who used to come together, have been\r\ndiscovered by the archaeologists.\r\n\r\nTraces of a more advanced period, already characterized by the use of\r\nsome pottery, are found in the shell-heaps of Denmark. They appear, as\r\nis well known, in the shape of heaps from five to ten feet thick, from\r\n100 to 200 feet wide, and 1,000 feet or more in length, and they are so\r\ncommon along some parts of the sea-coast that for a long time they were\r\nconsidered as natural growths. And yet they \"contain nothing but what\r\nhas been in some way or other subservient to the use of man,\" and they\r\nare so densely stuffed with products of human industry that, during a\r\ntwo days' stay at Milgaard, Lubbock dug out no less than 191 pieces of\r\nstone-implements and four fragments of pottery.(6) The very size and\r\nextension of the shell heaps prove that for generations and generations\r\nthe coasts of Denmark were inhabited by hundreds of small tribes which\r\ncertainly lived as peacefully together as the Fuegian tribes, which also\r\naccumulate like shellheaps, are living in our own times.\r\n\r\nAs to the lake-dwellings of Switzerland, which represent a still further\r\nadvance in civilization, they yield still better evidence of life and\r\nwork in societies. It is known that even during the stone age the shores\r\nof the Swiss lakes were dotted with a succession of villages, each of\r\nwhich consisted of several huts, and was built upon a platform supported\r\nby numberless pillars in the lake. No less than twenty-four, mostly\r\nstone age villages, were discovered along the shores of Lake Leman,\r\nthirty-two in the Lake of Constance, forty-six in the Lake of Neuchatel,\r\nand so on; and each of them testifies to the immense amount of labour\r\nwhich was spent in common by the tribe, not by the family. It has even\r\nbeen asserted that the life of the lake-dwellers must have been\r\nremarkably free of warfare. And so it probably was, especially if we\r\nrefer to the life of those primitive folk who live until the present\r\ntime in similar villages built upon pillars on the sea coasts.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen, even from the above rapid hints, that our knowledge of\r\nprimitive man is not so scanty after all, and that, so far as it goes,\r\nit is rather opposed than favourable to the Hobbesian speculations.\r\nMoreover, it may be supplemented, to a great extent, by the direct\r\nobservation of such primitive tribes as now stand on the same level of\r\ncivilization as the inhabitants of Europe stood in prehistoric times.\r\n\r\nThat these primitive tribes which we find now are not degenerated\r\nspecimens of mankind who formerly knew a higher civilization, as it has\r\noccasionally been maintained, has sufficiently been proved by Edwin\r\nTylor and Lubbock. However, to the arguments already opposed to the\r\ndegeneration theory, the following may be added. Save a few tribes\r\nclustering in the less-accessible highlands, the \"savages\" represent a\r\ngirdle which encircles the more or less civilized nations, and they\r\noccupy the extremities of our continents, most of which have retained\r\nstill, or recently were bearing, an early post-glacial character. Such\r\nare the Eskimos and their congeners in Greenland, Arctic America, and\r\nNorthern Siberia; and, in the Southern hemisphere, the Australians, the\r\nPapuas, the Fuegians, and, partly, the Bushmen; while within the\r\ncivilized area, like primitive folk are only found in the Himalayas, the\r\nhighlands of Australasia, and the plateaus of Brazil. Now it must be\r\nborne in mind that the glacial age did not come to an end at once over\r\nthe whole surface of the earth. It still continues in Greenland.\r\nTherefore, at a time when the littoral regions of the Indian Ocean, the\r\nMediterranean, or the Gulf of Mexico already enjoyed a warmer climate,\r\nand became the seats of higher civilizations, immense territories in\r\nmiddle Europe, Siberia, and Northern America, as well as in Patagonia,\r\nSouthern Africa, and Southern Australasia, remained in early postglacial\r\nconditions which rendered them inaccessible to the civilized nations of\r\nthe torrid and sub-torrid zones. They were at that time what the\r\nterrible urmans of North-West Siberia are now, and their population,\r\ninaccessible to and untouched by civilization, retained the characters\r\nof early post-glacial man. Later on, when desiccation rendered these\r\nterritories more suitable for agriculture, they were peopled with more\r\ncivilized immigrants; and while part of their previous inhabitants were\r\nassimilated by the new settlers, another part migrated further, and\r\nsettled where we find them. The territories they inhabit now are still,\r\nor recently were, sub-glacial, as to their physical features; their arts\r\nand implements are those of the neolithic age; and, notwithstanding\r\ntheir racial differences, and the distances which separate them, their\r\nmodes of life and social institutions bear a striking likeness. So we\r\ncannot but consider them as fragments of the early post-glacial\r\npopulation of the now civilized area.\r\n\r\nThe first thing which strikes us as soon as we begin studying primitive\r\nfolk is the complexity of the organization of marriage relations under\r\nwhich they are living. With most of them the family, in the sense we\r\nattribute to it, is hardly found in its germs. But they are by no means\r\nloose aggregations of men and women coming in a disorderly manner\r\ntogether in conformity with their momentary caprices. All of them are\r\nunder a certain organization, which has been described by Morgan in its\r\ngeneral aspects as the \"gentile,\" or clan organization.(7)\r\n\r\nTo tell the matter as briefly as possible, there is little doubt that\r\nmankind has passed at its beginnings through a stage which may be\r\ndescribed as that of \"communal marriage\"; that is, the whole tribe had\r\nhusbands and wives in common with but little regard to consanguinity.\r\nBut it is also certain that some restrictions to that free intercourse\r\nwere imposed at a very early period. Inter-marriage was soon prohibited\r\nbetween the sons of one mother and her sisters, granddaughters, and\r\naunts. Later on it was prohibited between the sons and daughters of the\r\nsame mother, and further limitations did not fail to follow. The idea of\r\na gens, or clan, which embodied all presumed descendants from one stock\r\n(or rather all those who gathered in one group) was evolved, and\r\nmarriage within the clan was entirely prohibited. It still remained\r\n\"communal,\" but the wife or the husband had to be taken from another\r\nclan. And when a gens became too numerous, and subdivided into several\r\ngentes, each of them was divided into classes (usually four), and\r\nmarriage was permitted only between certain well-defined classes. That\r\nis the stage which we find now among the Kamilaroi-speaking Australians.\r\nAs to the family, its first germs appeared amidst the clan organization.\r\nA woman who was captured in war from some other clan, and who formerly\r\nwould have belonged to the whole gens, could be kept at a later period\r\nby the capturer, under certain obligations towards the tribe. She may be\r\ntaken by him to a separate hut, after she had paid a certain tribute to\r\nthe clan, and thus constitute within the gens a separate family, the\r\nappearance of which evidently was opening a quite new phase of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nNow, if we take into consideration that this complicated organization\r\ndeveloped among men who stood at the lowest known degree of development,\r\nand that it maintained itself in societies knowing no kind of authority\r\nbesides the authority of public opinion, we at once see how deeply\r\ninrooted social instincts must have been in human nature, even at its\r\nlowest stages. A savage who is capable of living under such an\r\norganization, and of freely submitting to rules which continually clash\r\nwith his personal desires, certainly is not a beast devoid of ethical\r\nprinciples and knowing no rein to its passions. But the fact becomes\r\nstill more striking if we consider the immense antiquity of the clan\r\norganization. It is now known that the primitive Semites, the Greeks of\r\nHomer, the prehistoric Romans, the Germans of Tacitus, the early Celts\r\nand the early Slavonians, all have had their own period of clan\r\norganization, closely analogous to that of the Australians, the Red\r\nIndians, the Eskimos, and other inhabitants of the \"savage girdle.\"(9)\r\nSo we must admit that either the evolution of marriage laws went on on\r\nthe same lines among all human races, or the rudiments of the clan rules\r\nwere developed among some common ancestors of the Semites, the Aryans,\r\nthe Polynesians, etc., before their differentiation into separate races\r\ntook place, and that these rules were maintained, until now, among races\r\nlong ago separated from the common stock. Both alternatives imply,\r\nhowever, an equally striking tenacity of the institution--such a\r\ntenacity that no assaults of the individual could break it down through\r\nthe scores of thousands of years that it was in existence. The very\r\npersistence of the clan organization shows how utterly false it is to\r\nrepresent primitive mankind as a disorderly agglomeration of\r\nindividuals, who only obey their individual passions, and take advantage\r\nof their personal force and cunningness against all other\r\nrepresentatives of the species. Unbridled individualism is a modern\r\ngrowth, but it is not characteristic of primitive mankind.(10)\r\n\r\nGoing now over to the existing savages, we may begin with the Bushmen,\r\nwho stand at a very low level of development--so low indeed that they\r\nhave no dwellings and sleep in holes dug in the soil, occasionally\r\nprotected by some screens. It is known that when Europeans settled in\r\ntheir territory and destroyed deer, the Bushmen began stealing the\r\nsettlers' cattle, whereupon a war of extermination, too horrible to be\r\nrelated here, was waged against them. Five hundred Bushmen were\r\nslaughtered in 1774, three thousand in 1808 and 1809 by the Farmers'\r\nAlliance, and so on. They were poisoned like rats, killed by hunters\r\nlying in ambush before the carcass of some animal, killed wherever met\r\nwith.(11) So that our knowledge of the Bushmen, being chiefly borrowed\r\nfrom those same people who exterminated them, is necessarily limited.\r\nBut still we know that when the Europeans came, the Bushmen lived in\r\nsmall tribes (or clans), sometimes federated together; that they used to\r\nhunt in common, and divided the spoil without quarrelling; that they\r\nnever abandoned their wounded, and displayed strong affection to their\r\ncomrades. Lichtenstein has a most touching story about a Bushman, nearly\r\ndrowned in a river, who was rescued by his companions. They took off\r\ntheir furs to cover him, and shivered themselves; they dried him, rubbed\r\nhim before the fire, and smeared his body with warm grease till they\r\nbrought him back to life. And when the Bushmen found, in Johan van der\r\nWalt, a man who treated them well, they expressed their thankfulness by\r\na most touching attachment to that man.(12) Burchell and Moffat both\r\nrepresent them as goodhearted, disinterested, true to their promises,\r\nand grateful,(13) all qualities which could develop only by being\r\npractised within the tribe. As to their love to children, it is\r\nsufficient to say that when a European wished to secure a Bushman woman\r\nas a slave, he stole her child: the mother was sure to come into slavery\r\nto share the fate of her child.(14)\r\n\r\nThe same social manners characterize the Hottentots, who are but a\r\nlittle more developed than the Bushmen. Lubbock describes them as \"the\r\nfilthiest animals,\" and filthy they really are. A fur suspended to the\r\nneck and worn till it falls to pieces is all their dress; their huts are\r\na few sticks assembled together and covered with mats, with no kind of\r\nfurniture within. And though they kept oxen and sheep, and seem to have\r\nknown the use of iron before they made acquaintance with the Europeans,\r\nthey still occupy one of the lowest degrees of the human scale. And yet\r\nthose who knew them highly praised their sociability and readiness to\r\naid each other. If anything is given to a Hottentot, he at once divides\r\nit among all present--a habit which, as is known, so much struck Darwin\r\namong the Fuegians. He cannot eat alone, and, however hungry, he calls\r\nthose who pass by to share his food. And when Kolben expressed his\r\nastonishment thereat, he received the answer. \"That is Hottentot\r\nmanner.\" But this is not Hottentot manner only: it is an all but\r\nuniversal habit among the \"savages.\" Kolben, who knew the Hottentots\r\nwell and did not pass by their defects in silence, could not praise\r\ntheir tribal morality highly enough.\r\n\r\n\"Their word is sacred,\" he wrote. They know \"nothing of the corruptness\r\nand faithless arts of Europe.\" \"They live in great tranquillity and are\r\nseldom at war with their neighbours.\" They are \"all kindness and\r\ngoodwill to one another.. One of the greatest pleasures of the\r\nHottentots certainly lies in their gifts and good offices to one\r\nanother.\" \"The integrity of the Hottentots, their strictness and\r\ncelerity in the exercise of justice, and their chastity, are things in\r\nwhich they excel all or most nations in the world.\"(15)\r\n\r\nTachart, Barrow, and Moodie(16) fully confirm Kolben's testimony. Let me\r\nonly remark that when Kolben wrote that \"they are certainly the most\r\nfriendly, the most liberal and the most benevolent people to one another\r\nthat ever appeared on the earth\" (i. 332), he wrote a sentence which has\r\ncontinually appeared since in the description of savages. When first\r\nmeeting with primitive races, the Europeans usually make a caricature of\r\ntheir life; but when an intelligent man has stayed among them for a\r\nlonger time, he generally describes them as the \"kindest\" or \"the\r\ngentlest\" race on the earth. These very same words have been applied to\r\nthe Ostyaks, the Samoyedes, the Eskimos, the Dayaks, the Aleoutes, the\r\nPapuas, and so on, by the highest authorities. I also remember having\r\nread them applied to the Tunguses, the Tchuktchis, the Sioux, and\r\nseveral others. The very frequency of that high commendation already\r\nspeaks volumes in itself.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Australia do not stand on a higher level of development\r\nthan their South African brothers. Their huts are of the same character:\r\nvery often simple screens are the only protection against cold winds. In\r\ntheir food they are most indifferent: they devour horribly putrefied\r\ncorpses, and cannibalism is resorted to in times of scarcity. When first\r\ndiscovered by Europeans, they had no implements but in stone or bone,\r\nand these were of the roughest description. Some tribes had even no\r\ncanoes, and did not know barter-trade. And yet, when their manners and\r\ncustoms were carefully studied, they proved to be living under that\r\nelaborate clan organization which I have mentioned on a preceding\r\npage.(17)\r\n\r\nThe territory they inhabit is usually allotted between the different\r\ngentes or clans; but the hunting and fishing territories of each clan\r\nare kept in common, and the produce of fishing and hunting belongs to\r\nthe whole clan; so also the fishing and hunting implements.(18) The\r\nmeals are taken in common. Like many other savages, they respect certain\r\nregulations as to the seasons when certain gums and grasses may be\r\ncollected.(19) As to their morality altogether, we cannot do better than\r\ntranscribe the following answers given to the questions of the Paris\r\nAnthropological Society by Lumholtz, a missionary who sojourned in North\r\nQueensland:(20)--\r\n\r\n\"The feeling of friendship is known among them; it is strong. Weak\r\npeople are usually supported; sick people are very well attended to;\r\nthey never are abandoned or killed. These tribes are cannibals, but they\r\nvery seldom eat members of their own tribe (when immolated on religious\r\nprinciples, I suppose); they eat strangers only. The parents love their\r\nchildren, play with them, and pet them. Infanticide meets with common\r\napproval. Old people are very well treated, never put to death. No\r\nreligion, no idols, only a fear of death. Polygamous marriage, quarrels\r\narising within the tribe are settled by means of duels fought with\r\nwooden swords and shields. No slaves; no culture of any kind; no\r\npottery; no dress, save an apron sometimes worn by women. The clan\r\nconsists of two hundred individuals, divided into four classes of men\r\nand four of women; marriage being only permitted within the usual\r\nclasses, and never within the gens.\"\r\n\r\nFor the Papuas, closely akin to the above, we have the testimony of G.L.\r\nBink, who stayed in New Guinea, chiefly in Geelwink Bay, from 1871 to\r\n1883. Here is the essence of his answers to the same questioner:(21)--\r\n\r\n\"They are sociable and cheerful; they laugh very much. Rather timid than\r\ncourageous. Friendship is relatively strong among persons belonging to\r\ndifferent tribes, and still stronger within the tribe. A friend will\r\noften pay the debt of his friend, the stipulation being that the latter\r\nwill repay it without interest to the children of the lender. They take\r\ncare of the ill and the old; old people are never abandoned, and in no\r\ncase are they killed--unless it be a slave who was ill for a long time.\r\nWar prisoners are sometimes eaten. The children are very much petted and\r\nloved. Old and feeble war prisoners are killed, the others are sold as\r\nslaves. They have no religion, no gods, no idols, no authority of any\r\ndescription; the oldest man in the family is the judge. In cases of\r\nadultery a fine is paid, and part of it goes to the negoria (the\r\ncommunity). The soil is kept in common, but the crop belongs to those\r\nwho have grown it. They have pottery, and know barter-trade--the custom\r\nbeing that the merchant gives them the goods, whereupon they return to\r\ntheir houses and bring the native goods required by the merchant; if the\r\nlatter cannot be obtained, the European goods are returned.(22) They are\r\nhead-hunters, and in so doing they prosecute blood revenge. 'Sometimes,'\r\nFinsch says, 'the affair is referred to the Rajah of Namototte, who\r\nterminates it by imposing a fine.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen well treated, the Papuas are very kind. Miklukho-Maclay landed on\r\nthe eastern coast of New Guinea, followed by one single man, stayed for\r\ntwo years among tribes reported to be cannibals, and left them with\r\nregret; he returned again to stay one year more among them, and never\r\nhad he any conflict to complain of. True that his rule was never--under\r\nno pretext whatever--to say anything which was not truth, nor make any\r\npromise which he could not keep. These poor creatures, who even do not\r\nknow how to obtain fire, and carefully maintain it in their huts, live\r\nunder their primitive communism, without any chiefs; and within their\r\nvillages they have no quarrels worth speaking of. They work in common,\r\njust enough to get the food of the day; they rear their children in\r\ncommon; and in the evenings they dress themselves as coquettishly as\r\nthey can, and dance. Like all savages, they are fond of dancing. Each\r\nvillage has its barla, or balai--the \"long house,\" \"longue maison,\" or\r\n\"grande maison\"--for the unmarried men, for social gatherings, and for\r\nthe discussion of common affairs--again a trait which is common to most\r\ninhabitants of the Pacific Islands, the Eskimos, the Red Indians, and so\r\non. Whole groups of villages are on friendly terms, and visit each other\r\nen bloc.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, feuds are not uncommon--not in consequence of \"Overstocking\r\nof the area,\" or \"keen competition,\" and like inventions of a mercantile\r\ncentury, but chiefly in consequence of superstition. As soon as any one\r\nfalls ill, his friends and relatives come together, and deliberately\r\ndiscuss who might be the cause of the illness. All possible enemies are\r\nconsidered, every one confesses of his own petty quarrels, and finally\r\nthe real cause is discovered. An enemy from the next village has called\r\nit down, and a raid upon that village is decided upon. Therefore, feuds\r\nare rather frequent, even between the coast villages, not to say a word\r\nof the cannibal mountaineers who are considered as real witches and\r\nenemies, though, on a closer acquaintance, they prove to be exactly the\r\nsame sort of people as their neighbours on the seacoast.(23)\r\n\r\nMany striking pages could be written about the harmony which prevails in\r\nthe villages of the Polynesian inhabitants of the Pacific Islands. But\r\nthey belong to a more advanced stage of civilization. So we shall now\r\ntake our illustrations from the far north. I must mention, however,\r\nbefore leaving the Southern Hemisphere, that even the Fuegians, whose\r\nreputation has been so bad, appear under a much better light since they\r\nbegin to be better known. A few French missionaries who stay among them\r\n\"know of no act of malevolence to complain of.\" In their clans,\r\nconsisting of from 120 to 150 souls, they practise the same primitive\r\ncommunism as the Papuas; they share everything in common, and treat\r\ntheir old people very well. Peace prevails among these tribes.(24) With\r\nthe Eskimos and their nearest congeners, the Thlinkets, the Koloshes,\r\nand the Aleoutes, we find one of the nearest illustrations of what man\r\nmay have been during the glacial age. Their implements hardly differ\r\nfrom those of palaeolithic man, and some of their tribes do not yet know\r\nfishing: they simply spear the fish with a kind of harpoon.(25) They\r\nknow the use of iron, but they receive it from the Europeans, or find it\r\non wrecked ships. Their social organization is of a very primitive kind,\r\nthough they already have emerged from the stage of \"communal marriage,\"\r\neven under the gentile restrictions. They live in families, but the\r\nfamily bonds are often broken; husbands and wives are often\r\nexchanged.(26) The families, however, remain united in clans, and how\r\ncould it be otherwise? How could they sustain the hard struggle for life\r\nunless by closely combining their forces? So they do, and the tribal\r\nbonds are closest where the struggle for life is hardest, namely, in\r\nNorth-East Greenland. The \"long house\" is their usual dwelling, and\r\nseveral families lodge in it, separated from each other by small\r\npartitions of ragged furs, with a common passage in the front. Sometimes\r\nthe house has the shape of a cross, and in such case a common fire is\r\nkept in the centre. The German Expedition which spent a winter close by\r\none of those \"long houses\" could ascertain that \"no quarrel disturbed\r\nthe peace, no dispute arose about the use of this narrow space\"\r\nthroughout the long winter. \"Scolding, or even unkind words, are\r\nconsidered as a misdemeanour, if not produced under the legal form of\r\nprocess, namely, the nith-song.\"(27) Close cohabitation and close\r\ninterdependence are sufficient for maintaining century after century\r\nthat deep respect for the interests of the community which is\r\ncharacteristic of Eskimo life. Even in the larger communities of\r\nEskimos, \"public opinion formed the real judgment-seat, the general\r\npunishment consisting in the offenders being shamed in the eyes of the\r\npeople.\"(28)\r\n\r\nEskimo life is based upon communism. What is obtained by hunting and\r\nfishing belongs to the clan. But in several tribes, especially in the\r\nWest, under the influence of the Danes, private property penetrates into\r\ntheir institutions. However, they have an original means for obviating\r\nthe inconveniences arising from a personal accumulation of wealth which\r\nwould soon destroy their tribal unity. When a man has grown rich, he\r\nconvokes the folk of his clan to a great festival, and, after much\r\neating, distributes among them all his fortune. On the Yukon river, Dall\r\nsaw an Aleonte family distributing in this way ten guns, ten full fur\r\ndresses, 200 strings of beads, numerous blankets, ten wolf furs, 200\r\nbeavers, and 500 zibelines. After that they took off their festival\r\ndresses, gave them away, and, putting on old ragged furs, addressed a\r\nfew words to their kinsfolk, saying that though they are now poorer than\r\nany one of them, they have won their friendship.(29) Like distributions\r\nof wealth appear to be a regular habit with the Eskimos, and to take\r\nplace at a certain season, after an exhibition of all that has been\r\nobtained during the year.(30) In my opinion these distributions reveal a\r\nvery old institution, contemporaneous with the first apparition of\r\npersonal wealth; they must have been a means for re-establishing\r\nequality among the members of the clan, after it had been disturbed by\r\nthe enrichment of the few. The periodical redistribution of land and the\r\nperiodical abandonment of all debts which took place in historical times\r\nwith so many different races (Semites, Aryans, etc.), must have been a\r\nsurvival of that old custom. And the habit of either burying with the\r\ndead, or destroying upon his grave, all that belonged to him\r\npersonally--a habit which we find among all primitive races--must have\r\nhad the same origin. In fact, while everything that belongs personally\r\nto the dead is burnt or broken upon his grave, nothing is destroyed of\r\nwhat belonged to him in common with the tribe, such as boats, or the\r\ncommunal implements of fishing. The destruction bears upon personal\r\nproperty alone. At a later epoch this habit becomes a religious\r\nceremony. It receives a mystical interpretation, and is imposed by\r\nreligion, when public opinion alone proves incapable of enforcing its\r\ngeneral observance. And, finally, it is substituted by either burning\r\nsimple models of the dead man's property (as in China), or by simply\r\ncarrying his property to the grave and taking it back to his house after\r\nthe burial ceremony is over--a habit which still prevails with the\r\nEuropeans as regards swords, crosses, and other marks of public\r\ndistinction.(31)\r\n\r\nThe high standard of the tribal morality of the Eskimos has often been\r\nmentioned in general literature. Nevertheless the following remarks upon\r\nthe manners of the Aleoutes--nearly akin to the Eskimos--will better\r\nillustrate savage morality as a whole. They were written, after a ten\r\nyears' stay among the Aleoutes, by a most remarkable man--the Russian\r\nmissionary, Veniaminoff. I sum them up, mostly in his own words:--\r\n\r\nEndurability (he wrote) is their chief feature. It is simply colossal.\r\nNot only do they bathe every morning in the frozen sea, and stand naked\r\non the beach, inhaling the icy wind, but their endurability, even when\r\nat hard work on insufficient food, surpasses all that can be imagined.\r\nDuring a protracted scarcity of food, the Aleoute cares first for his\r\nchildren; he gives them all he has, and himself fasts. They are not\r\ninclined to stealing; that was remarked even by the first Russian\r\nimmigrants. Not that they never steal; every Aleoute would confess\r\nhaving sometime stolen something, but it is always a trifle; the whole\r\nis so childish. The attachment of the parents to their children is\r\ntouching, though it is never expressed in words or pettings. The Aleoute\r\nis with difficulty moved to make a promise, but once he has made it he\r\nwill keep it whatever may happen. (An Aleoute made Veniaminoff a gift of\r\ndried fish, but it was forgotten on the beach in the hurry of the\r\ndeparture. He took it home. The next occasion to send it to the\r\nmissionary was in January; and in November and December there was a\r\ngreat scarcity of food in the Aleoute encampment. But the fish was never\r\ntouched by the starving people, and in January it was sent to its\r\ndestination.) Their code of morality is both varied and severe. It is\r\nconsidered shameful to be afraid of unavoidable death; to ask pardon\r\nfrom an enemy; to die without ever having killed an enemy; to be\r\nconvicted of stealing; to capsize a boat in the harbour; to be afraid of\r\ngoing to sea in stormy weather; to be the first in a party on a long\r\njourney to become an invalid in case of scarcity of food; to show\r\ngreediness when spoil is divided, in which case every one gives his own\r\npart to the greedy man to shame him; to divulge a public secret to his\r\nwife; being two persons on a hunting expedition, not to offer the best\r\ngame to the partner; to boast of his own deeds, especially of invented\r\nones; to scold any one in scorn. Also to beg; to pet his wife in other\r\npeople's presence, and to dance with her to bargain personally: selling\r\nmust always be made through a third person, who settles the price. For a\r\nwoman it is a shame not to know sewing, dancing and all kinds of woman's\r\nwork; to pet her husband and children, or even to speak to her husband\r\nin the presence of a stranger.(32)\r\n\r\nSuch is Aleoute morality, which might also be further illustrated by\r\ntheir tales and legends. Let me also add that when Veniaminoff wrote (in\r\n1840) one murder only had been committed since the last century in a\r\npopulation of 60,000 people, and that among 1,800 Aleoutes not one\r\nsingle common law offence had been known for forty years. This will not\r\nseem strange if we remark that scolding, scorning, and the use of rough\r\nwords are absolutely unknown in Aleoute life. Even their children never\r\nfight, and never abuse each other in words. All they may say is, \"Your\r\nmother does not know sewing,\" or \"Your father is blind of one eye.\"(33)\r\n\r\nMany features of savage life remain, however, a puzzle to Europeans. The\r\nhigh development of tribal solidarity and the good feelings with which\r\nprimitive folk are animated towards each other, could be illustrated by\r\nany amount of reliable testimony. And yet it is not the less certain\r\nthat those same savages practise infanticide; that in some cases they\r\nabandon their old people, and that they blindly obey the rules of\r\nblood-revenge. We must then explain the coexistence of facts which, to\r\nthe European mind, seem so contradictory at the first sight. I have just\r\nmentioned how the Aleoute father starves for days and weeks, and gives\r\neverything eatable to his child; and how the Bushman mother becomes a\r\nslave to follow her child; and I might fill pages with illustrations of\r\nthe really tender relations existing among the savages and their\r\nchildren. Travellers continually mention them incidentally. Here you\r\nread about the fond love of a mother; there you see a father wildly\r\nrunning through the forest and carrying upon his shoulders his child\r\nbitten by a snake; or a missionary tells you the despair of the parents\r\nat the loss of a child whom he had saved, a few years before, from being\r\nimmolated at its birth, you learn that the \"savage\" mothers usually\r\nnurse their children till the age of four, and that, in the New\r\nHebrides, on the loss of a specially beloved child, its mother, or aunt,\r\nwill kill herself to take care of it in the other world.(34) And so on.\r\n\r\nLike facts are met with by the score; so that, when we see that these\r\nsame loving parents practise infanticide, we are bound to recognize that\r\nthe habit (whatever its ulterior transformations may be) took its origin\r\nunder the sheer pressure of necessity, as an obligation towards the\r\ntribe, and a means for rearing the already growing children. The\r\nsavages, as a rule, do not \"multiply without stint,\" as some English\r\nwriters put it. On the contrary, they take all kinds of measures for\r\ndiminishing the birth-rate. A whole series of restrictions, which\r\nEuropeans certainly would find extravagant, are imposed to that effect,\r\nand they are strictly obeyed. But notwithstanding that, primitive folk\r\ncannot rear all their children. However, it has been remarked that as\r\nsoon as they succeed in increasing their regular means of subsistence,\r\nthey at once begin to abandon the practice of infanticide. On the whole,\r\nthe parents obey that obligation reluctantly, and as soon as they can\r\nafford it they resort to all kinds of compromises to save the lives of\r\ntheir new-born. As has been so well pointed out by my friend Elie\r\nReclus,(35) they invent the lucky and unlucky days of births, and spare\r\nthe children born on the lucky days; they try to postpone the sentence\r\nfor a few hours, and then say that if the baby has lived one day it must\r\nlive all its natural life.(36) They hear the cries of the little ones\r\ncoming from the forest, and maintain that, if heard, they forbode a\r\nmisfortune for the tribe; and as they have no baby-farming nor creches\r\nfor getting rid of the children, every one of them recoils before the\r\nnecessity of performing the cruel sentence; they prefer to expose the\r\nbaby in the wood rather than to take its life by violence. Ignorance,\r\nnot cruelty, maintains infanticide; and, instead of moralizing the\r\nsavages with sermons, the missionaries would do better to follow the\r\nexample of Veniaminoff, who, every year till his old age, crossed the\r\nsea of Okhotsk in a miserable boat, or travelled on dogs among his\r\nTchuktchis, supplying them with bread and fishing implements. He thus\r\nhad really stopped infanticide.\r\n\r\nThe same is true as regards what superficial observers describe as\r\nparricide. We just now saw that the habit of abandoning old people is\r\nnot so widely spread as some writers have maintained it to be. It has\r\nbeen extremely exaggerated, but it is occasionally met with among nearly\r\nall savages; and in such cases it has the same origin as the exposure of\r\nchildren. When a \"savage\" feels that he is a burden to his tribe; when\r\nevery morning his share of food is taken from the mouths of the\r\nchildren--and the little ones are not so stoical as their fathers: they\r\ncry when they are hungry; when every day he has to be carried across the\r\nstony beach, or the virgin forest, on the shoulders of younger people\r\nthere are no invalid carriages, nor destitutes to wheel them in savage\r\nlands--he begins to repeat what the old Russian peasants say until\r\nnow-a-day. \"Tchujoi vek zayedayu, Pora na pokoi!\" (\"I live other\r\npeople's life: it is time to retire!\") And he retires. He does what the\r\nsoldier does in a similar case. When the salvation of his detachment\r\ndepends upon its further advance, and he can move no more, and knows\r\nthat he must die if left behind, the soldier implores his best friend to\r\nrender him the last service before leaving the encampment. And the\r\nfriend, with shivering hands, discharges his gun into the dying body. So\r\nthe savages do. The old man asks himself to die; he himself insists upon\r\nthis last duty towards the community, and obtains the consent of the\r\ntribe; he digs out his grave; he invites his kinsfolk to the last\r\nparting meal. His father has done so, it is now his turn; and he parts\r\nwith his kinsfolk with marks of affection. The savage so much considers\r\ndeath as part of his duties towards his community, that he not only\r\nrefuses to be rescued (as Moffat has told), but when a woman who had to\r\nbe immolated on her husband's grave was rescued by missionaries, and was\r\ntaken to an island, she escaped in the night, crossed a broad sea-arm,\r\nswimming and rejoined her tribe, to die on the grave.(37) It has become\r\nwith them a matter of religion. But the savages, as a rule, are so\r\nreluctant to take any one's life otherwise than in fight, that none of\r\nthem will take upon himself to shed human blood, and they resort to all\r\nkinds of stratagems, which have been so falsely interpreted. In most\r\ncases, they abandon the old man in the wood, after having given him more\r\nthan his share of the common food. Arctic expeditions have done the same\r\nwhen they no more could carry their invalid comrades. \"Live a few days\r\nmore, maybe there will be some unexpected rescue!\" West European men of\r\nscience, when coming across these facts, are absolutely unable to stand\r\nthem; they can not reconcile them with a high development of tribal\r\nmorality, and they prefer to cast a doubt upon the exactitude of\r\nabsolutely reliable observers, instead of trying to explain the parallel\r\nexistence of the two sets of facts: a high tribal morality together with\r\nthe abandonment of the parents and infanticide. But if these same\r\nEuropeans were to tell a savage that people, extremely amiable, fond of\r\ntheir own children, and so impressionable that they cry when they see a\r\nmisfortune simulated on the stage, are living in Europe within a stone's\r\nthrow from dens in which children die from sheer want of food, the\r\nsavage, too, would not understand them. I remember how vainly I tried to\r\nmake some of my Tungus friends understand our civilization of\r\nindividualism: they could not, and they resorted to the most fantastical\r\nsuggestions. The fact is that a savage, brought up in ideas of a tribal\r\nsolidarity in everything for bad and for good, is as incapable of\r\nunderstanding a \"moral\" European, who knows nothing of that solidarity,\r\nas the average European is incapable of understanding the savage. But if\r\nour scientist had lived amidst a half-starving tribe which does not\r\npossess among them all one man's food for so much as a few days to come,\r\nhe probably might have understood their motives. So also the savage, if\r\nhe had stayed among us, and received our education, may be, would\r\nunderstand our European indifference towards our neighbours, and our\r\nRoyal Commissions for the prevention of \"babyfarming.\" \"Stone houses\r\nmake stony hearts,\" the Russian peasants say. But he ought to live in a\r\nstone house first.\r\n\r\nSimilar remarks must be made as regards cannibalism. Taking into account\r\nall the facts which were brought to light during a recent controversy on\r\nthis subject at the Paris Anthropological Society, and many incidental\r\nremarks scattered throughout the \"savage\" literature, we are bound to\r\nrecognize that that practice was brought into existence by sheer\r\nnecessity. But that it was further developed by superstition and\r\nreligion into the proportions it attained in Fiji or in Mexico. It is a\r\nfact that until this day many savages are compelled to devour corpses in\r\nthe most advanced state of putrefaction, and that in cases of absolute\r\nscarcity some of them have had to disinter and to feed upon human\r\ncorpses, even during an epidemic. These are ascertained facts. But if we\r\nnow transport ourselves to the conditions which man had to face during\r\nthe glacial period, in a damp and cold climate, with but little\r\nvegetable food at his disposal; if we take into account the terrible\r\nravages which scurvy still makes among underfed natives, and remember\r\nthat meat and fresh blood are the only restoratives which they know, we\r\nmust admit that man, who formerly was a granivorous animal, became a\r\nflesh-eater during the glacial period. He found plenty of deer at that\r\ntime, but deer often migrate in the Arctic regions, and sometimes they\r\nentirely abandon a territory for a number of years. In such cases his\r\nlast resources disappeared. During like hard trials, cannibalism has\r\nbeen resorted to even by Europeans, and it was resorted to by the\r\nsavages. Until the present time, they occasionally devour the corpses of\r\ntheir own dead: they must have devoured then the corpses of those who\r\nhad to die. Old people died, convinced that by their death they were\r\nrendering a last service to the tribe. This is why cannibalism is\r\nrepresented by some savages as of divine origin, as something that has\r\nbeen ordered by a messenger from the sky. But later on it lost its\r\ncharacter of necessity, and survived as a superstition. Enemies had to\r\nbe eaten in order to inherit their courage; and, at a still later epoch,\r\nthe enemy's eye or heart was eaten for the same purpose; while among\r\nother tribes, already having a numerous priesthood and a developed\r\nmythology, evil gods, thirsty for human blood, were invented, and human\r\nsacrifices required by the priests to appease the gods. In this\r\nreligious phase of its existence, cannibalism attained its most\r\nrevolting characters. Mexico is a well-known example; and in Fiji, where\r\nthe king could eat any one of his subjects, we also find a mighty cast\r\nof priests, a complicated theology,(38) and a full development of\r\nautocracy. Originated by necessity, cannibalism became, at a later\r\nperiod, a religious institution, and in this form it survived long after\r\nit had disappeared from among tribes which certainly practised it in\r\nformer times, but did not attain the theocratical stage of evolution.\r\nThe same remark must be made as regards infanticide and the abandonment\r\nof parents. In some cases they also have been maintained as a survival\r\nof olden times, as a religiously-kept tradition of the past.\r\n\r\nI will terminate my remarks by mentioning another custom which also is a\r\nsource of most erroneous conclusions. I mean the practice of\r\nblood-revenge. All savages are under the impression that blood shed must\r\nbe revenged by blood. If any one has been killed, the murderer must die;\r\nif any one has been wounded, the aggressor's blood must be shed. There\r\nis no exception to the rule, not even for animals; so the hunter's blood\r\nis shed on his return to the village when he has shed the blood of an\r\nanimal. That is the savages' conception of justice--a conception which\r\nyet prevails in Western Europe as regards murder. Now, when both the\r\noffender and the offended belong to the same tribe, the tribe and the\r\noffended person settle the affair.(39) But when the offender belongs to\r\nanother tribe, and that tribe, for one reason or another, refuses a\r\ncompensation, then the offended tribe decides to take the revenge\r\nitself. Primitive folk so much consider every one's acts as a tribal\r\naffair, dependent upon tribal approval, that they easily think the clan\r\nresponsible for every one's acts. Therefore, the due revenge may be\r\ntaken upon any member of the offender's clan or relatives.(40) It may\r\noften happen, however, that the retaliation goes further than the\r\noffence. In trying to inflict a wound, they may kill the offender, or\r\nwound him more than they intended to do, and this becomes a cause for a\r\nnew feud, so that the primitive legislators were careful in requiring\r\nthe retaliation to be limited to an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,\r\nand blood for blood.(41)\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, however, that with most primitive folk like feuds are\r\ninfinitely rarer than might be expected; though with some of them they\r\nmay attain abnormal proportions, especially with mountaineers who have\r\nbeen driven to the highlands by foreign invaders, such as the\r\nmountaineers of Caucasia, and especially those of Borneo--the Dayaks.\r\nWith the Dayaks--we were told lately--the feuds had gone so far that a\r\nyoung man could neither marry nor be proclaimed of age before he had\r\nsecured the head of an enemy. This horrid practice was fully described\r\nin a modern English work.(42) It appears, however, that this affirmation\r\nwas a gross exaggeration. Moreover, Dayak \"head-hunting\" takes quite\r\nanother aspect when we learn that the supposed \"headhunter\" is not\r\nactuated at all by personal passion. He acts under what he considers as\r\na moral obligation towards his tribe, just as the European judge who, in\r\nobedience to the same, evidently wrong, principle of \"blood for blood,\"\r\nhands over the condemned murderer to the hangman. Both the Dayak and the\r\njudge would even feel remorse if sympathy moved them to spare the\r\nmurderer. That is why the Dayaks, apart from the murders they commit\r\nwhen actuated by their conception of justice, are depicted, by all those\r\nwho know them, as a most sympathetic people. Thus Carl Bock, the same\r\nauthor who has given such a terrible picture of head-hunting, writes:\r\n\r\n     \"As regards morality, I am bound to assign to the Dayaks a high\r\n     place in the scale of civilization.... Robberies and theft are\r\n     entirely unknown among them. They also are very truthful.... If I\r\n     did not always get the 'whole truth,' I always got, at least,\r\n     nothing but the truth from them. I wish I could say the same of the\r\n     Malays\" (pp. 209 and 210).\r\n\r\nBock's testimony is fully corroborated by that of Ida Pfeiffer. \"I fully\r\nrecognized,\" she wrote, \"that I should be pleased longer to travel among\r\nthem. I usually found them honest, good, and reserved ... much more so\r\nthan any other nation I know.\"(43) Stoltze used almost the same language\r\nwhen speaking of them. The Dayaks usually have but one wife, and treat\r\nher well. They are very sociable, and every morning the whole clan goes\r\nout for fishing, hunting, or gardening, in large parties. Their villages\r\nconsist of big huts, each of which is inhabited by a dozen families, and\r\nsometimes by several hundred persons, peacefully living together. They\r\nshow great respect for their wives, and are fond of their children; and\r\nwhen one of them falls ill, the women nurse him in turn. As a rule they\r\nare very moderate in eating and drinking. Such is the Dayak in his real\r\ndaily life.\r\n\r\nIt would be a tedious repetition if more illustrations from savage life\r\nwere given. Wherever we go we find the same sociable manners, the same\r\nspirit of solidarity. And when we endeavour to penetrate into the\r\ndarkness of past ages, we find the same tribal life, the same\r\nassociations of men, however primitive, for mutual support. Therefore,\r\nDarwin was quite right when he saw in man's social qualities the chief\r\nfactor for his further evolution, and Darwin's vulgarizers are entirely\r\nwrong when they maintain the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe small strength and speed of man (he wrote), his want of natural\r\nweapons, etc., are more than counterbalanced, firstly, by his\r\nintellectual faculties (which, he remarked on another page, have been\r\nchiefly or even exclusively gained for the benefit of the community).\r\nand secondly, by his social qualities, which led him to give and receive\r\naid from his fellow men.(44)\r\n\r\nIn the last century the \"savage\" and his \"life in the state of nature\"\r\nwere idealized. But now men of science have gone to the opposite\r\nextreme, especially since some of them, anxious to prove the animal\r\norigin of man, but not conversant with the social aspects of animal\r\nlife, began to charge the savage with all imaginable \"bestial\" features.\r\nIt is evident, however, that this exaggeration is even more unscientific\r\nthan Rousseau's idealization. The savage is not an ideal of virtue, nor\r\nis he an ideal of \"savagery.\" But the primitive man has one quality,\r\nelaborated and maintained by the very necessities of his hard struggle\r\nfor life--he identifies his own existence with that of his tribe; and\r\nwithout that quality mankind never would have attained the level it has\r\nattained now.\r\n\r\nPrimitive folk, as has been already said, so much identify their lives\r\nwith that of the tribe, that each of their acts, however insignificant,\r\nis considered as a tribal affair. Their whole behaviour is regulated by\r\nan infinite series of unwritten rules of propriety which are the fruit\r\nof their common experience as to what is good or bad--that is,\r\nbeneficial or harmful for their own tribe. Of course, the reasonings\r\nupon which their rules of propriety are based sometimes are absurd in\r\nthe extreme. Many of them originate in superstition; and altogether, in\r\nwhatever the savage does, he sees but the immediate consequences of his\r\nacts; he cannot foresee their indirect and ulterior consequences--thus\r\nsimply exaggerating a defect with which Bentham reproached civilized\r\nlegislators. But, absurd or not, the savage obeys the prescriptions of\r\nthe common law, however inconvenient they may be. He obeys them even\r\nmore blindly than the civilized man obeys the prescriptions of the\r\nwritten law. His common law is his religion; it is his very habit of\r\nliving. The idea of the clan is always present to his mind, and\r\nself-restriction and self-sacrifice in the interest of the clan are of\r\ndaily occurrence. If the savage has infringed one of the smaller tribal\r\nrules, he is prosecuted by the mockeries of the women. If the\r\ninfringement is grave, he is tortured day and night by the fear of\r\nhaving called a calamity upon his tribe. If he has wounded by accident\r\nany one of his own clan, and thus has committed the greatest of all\r\ncrimes, he grows quite miserable: he runs away in the woods, and is\r\nready to commit suicide, unless the tribe absolves him by inflicting\r\nupon him a physical pain and sheds some of his own blood.(45) Within the\r\ntribe everything is shared in common; every morsel of food is divided\r\namong all present; and if the savage is alone in the woods, he does not\r\nbegin eating before he has loudly shouted thrice an invitation to any\r\none who may hear his voice to share his meal.(46)\r\n\r\nIn short, within the tribe the rule of \"each for all\" is supreme, so\r\nlong as the separate family has not yet broken up the tribal unity. But\r\nthat rule is not extended to the neighbouring clans, or tribes, even\r\nwhen they are federated for mutual protection. Each tribe, or clan, is a\r\nseparate unity. Just as among mammals and birds, the territory is\r\nroughly allotted among separate tribes, and, except in times of war, the\r\nboundaries are respected. On entering the territory of his neighbours\r\none must show that he has no bad intentions. The louder one heralds his\r\ncoming, the more confidence he wins; and if he enters a house, he must\r\ndeposit his hatchet at the entrance. But no tribe is bound to share its\r\nfood with the others: it may do so or it may not. Therefore the life of\r\nthe savage is divided into two sets of actions, and appears under two\r\ndifferent ethical aspects: the relations within the tribe, and the\r\nrelations with the outsiders; and (like our international law) the\r\n\"inter-tribal\" law widely differs from the common law. Therefore, when\r\nit comes to a war the most revolting cruelties may be considered as so\r\nmany claims upon the admiration of the tribe. This double conception of\r\nmorality passes through the whole evolution of mankind, and maintains\r\nitself until now. We Europeans have realized some progress--not immense,\r\nat any rate--in eradicating that double conception of ethics; but it\r\nalso must be said that while we have in some measure extended our ideas\r\nof solidarity--in theory, at least--over the nation, and partly over\r\nother nations as well, we have lessened the bonds of solidarity within\r\nour own nations, and even within our own families.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a separate family amidst the clan necessarily disturbs\r\nthe established unity. A separate family means separate property and\r\naccumulation of wealth. We saw how the Eskimos obviate its\r\ninconveniences; and it is one of the most interesting studies to follow\r\nin the course of ages the different institutions (village communities,\r\nguilds, and so on) by means of which the masses endeavoured to maintain\r\nthe tribal unity, notwithstanding the agencies which were at work to\r\nbreak it down. On the other hand, the first rudiments of knowledge which\r\nappeared at an extremely remote epoch, when they confounded themselves\r\nwith witchcraft, also became a power in the hands of the individual\r\nwhich could be used against the tribe. They were carefully kept in\r\nsecrecy, and transmitted to the initiated only, in the secret societies\r\nof witches, shamans, and priests, which we find among all savages. By\r\nthe same time, wars and invasions created military authority, as also\r\ncastes of warriors, whose associations or clubs acquired great powers.\r\nHowever, at no period of man's life were wars the normal state of\r\nexistence. While warriors exterminated each other, and the priests\r\ncelebrated their massacres, the masses continued to live their daily\r\nlife, they prosecuted their daily toil. And it is one of the most\r\ninteresting studies to follow that life of the masses; to study the\r\nmeans by which they maintained their own social organization, which was\r\nbased upon their own conceptions of equity, mutual aid, and mutual\r\nsupport--of common law, in a word, even when they were submitted to the\r\nmost ferocious theocracy or autocracy in the State.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1.

Anthropologists who fully endorse the above views as regards man\r\nnevertheless intimate, sometimes, that the apes live in polygamous\r\nfamilies, under the leadership of \"a strong and jealous male.\" I do not\r\nknow how far that assertion is based upon conclusive observation. But\r\nthe passage from Brehm's Life of Animals, which is sometimes referred\r\nto, can hardly be taken as very conclusive. It occurs in his general\r\ndescription of monkeys; but his more detailed descriptions of separate\r\nspecies either contradict it or do not confirm it. Even as regards the\r\ncercopitheques, Brehm is affirmative in saying that they \"nearly always\r\nlive in bands, and very seldom in families\" (French edition, p. 59). As\r\nto other species, the very numbers of their bands, always containing\r\nmany males, render the \"polygamous family\" more than doubtful further\r\nobservation is evidently wanted.\r\n\r\n4.

MacLennan,\r\nStudies in Ancient History, 1st series, new edition, 1886; 2nd series,\r\n1896; L. Fison and A.W. Howitt, Kamilaroi and Kurnai, Melbourne. These\r\nfour writers--as has been very truly remarked by Giraud\r\nTeulon,--starting from different facts and different general ideas, and\r\nfollowing different methods, have come to the same conclusion. To\r\nBachofen we owe the notion of the maternal family and the maternal\r\nsuccession; to Morgan--the system of kinship, Malayan and Turanian, and\r\na highly gifted sketch of the main phases of human evolution; to\r\nMacLennan--the law of exogeny; and to Fison and Howitt--the cuadro, or\r\nscheme, of the conjugal societies in Australia. All four end in\r\nestablishing the same fact of the tribal origin of the family. When\r\nBachofen first drew attention to the maternal family, in his\r\nepoch-making work, and Morgan described the clan-organization,--both\r\nconcurring to the almost general extension of these forms and\r\nmaintaining that the marriage laws lie at the very basis of the\r\nconsecutive steps of human evolution, they were accused of exaggeration.\r\nHowever, the most careful researches prosecuted since, by a phalanx of\r\nstudents of ancient law, have proved that all races of mankind bear\r\ntraces of having passed through similar stages of development of\r\nmarriage laws, such as we now see in force among certain savages. See\r\nthe works of Post, Dargun, Kovalevsky, Lubbock, and their numerous\r\nfollowers: Lippert, Mucke, etc.\r\n\r\n8. None\r\n\r\n9.

Cf. also A. Post, Die\r\nGeschlechtsgenossenschaft der Urzeit, Oldenburg 1875.\r\n\r\n10. It would be impossible to enter here into a discussion of the origin\r\nof the marriage restrictions. Let me only remark that a division into\r\ngroups, similar to Morgan's Hawaian, exists among birds; the young\r\nbroods live together separately from their parents. A like division\r\nmight probably be traced among some mammals as well. As to the\r\nprohibition of relations between brothers and sisters, it is more likely\r\nto have arisen, not from speculations about the bad effects of\r\nconsanguinity, which speculations really do not seem probable, but to\r\navoid the too-easy precocity of like marriages. Under close cohabitation\r\nit must have become of imperious necessity. I must also remark that in\r\ndiscussing the origin of new customs altogether, we must keep in mind\r\nthat the savages, like us, have their \"thinkers\" and savants-wizards,\r\ndoctors, prophets, etc.--whose knowledge and ideas are in advance upon\r\nthose of the masses. United as they are in their secret unions (another\r\nalmost universal feature) they are certainly capable of exercising a\r\npowerful influence, and of enforcing customs the utility of which may\r\nnot yet be recognized by the majority of the tribe.\r\n\r\n11.

Every one throws\r\nhis stone, or gives his blow with the hatchet, carefully avoiding to\r\ngive a mortal blow. At a later epoch, the priest will stab the victim\r\nwith a sacred knife. Still later, it will be the king, until\r\ncivilization invents the hired hangman. See Bastian's deep remarks upon\r\nthis subject in Der Mensch in der Geschichte, iii. Die Blutrache, pp.\r\n1-36. A remainder of this tribal habit, I am told by Professor E. Nys,\r\nhas survived in military executions till our own times. In the middle\r\nportion of the nineteenth century it was the habit to load the rifles of\r\nthe twelve soldiers called out for shooting the condemned victim, with\r\neleven ball-cartridges and one blank cartridge. As the soldiers never\r\nknew who of them had the latter, each one could console his disturbed\r\nconscience by thinking that he was not one of the murderers.\r\n\r\n40.

Communal work. Judicial procedure. Inter-tribal law.\r\nIllustrations from the life of our contemporaries. Buryates. Kabyles.\r\nCaucasian mountaineers. African stems.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to study primitive mankind without being deeply\r\nimpressed by the sociability it has displayed since its very first steps\r\nin life. Traces of human societies are found in the relics of both the\r\noldest and the later stone age; and, when we come to observe the savages\r\nwhose manners of life are still those of neolithic man, we find them\r\nclosely bound together by an extremely ancient clan organization which\r\nenables them to combine their individually weak forces, to enjoy life in\r\ncommon, and to progress. Man is no exception in nature. He also is\r\nsubject to the great principle of Mutual Aid which grants the best\r\nchances of survival to those who best support each other in the struggle\r\nfor life. These were the conclusions arrived at in the previous\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nHowever, as soon as we come to a higher stage of civilization, and refer\r\nto history which already has something to say about that stage, we are\r\nbewildered by the struggles and conflicts which it reveals. The old\r\nbonds seem entirely to be broken. Stems are seen to fight against stems,\r\ntribes against tribes, individuals against individuals; and out of this\r\nchaotic contest of hostile forces, mankind issues divided into castes,\r\nenslaved to despots, separated into States always ready to wage war\r\nagainst each other. And, with this history of mankind in his hands, the\r\npessimist philosopher triumphantly concludes that warfare and oppression\r\nare the very essence of human nature; that the warlike and predatory\r\ninstincts of man can only be restrained within certain limits by a\r\nstrong authority which enforces peace and thus gives an opportunity to\r\nthe few and nobler ones to prepare a better life for humanity in times\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as soon as the every-day life of man during the historical\r\nperiod is submitted to a closer analysis and so it has been, of late, by\r\nmany patient students of very early institutions--it appears at once\r\nunder quite a different aspect. Leaving aside the preconceived ideas of\r\nmost historians and their pronounced predilection for the dramatic\r\naspects of history, we see that the very documents they habitually\r\nperuse are such as to exaggerate the part of human life given to\r\nstruggles and to underrate its peaceful moods. The bright and sunny days\r\nare lost sight of in the gales and storms. Even in our own time, the\r\ncumbersome records which we prepare for the future historian, in our\r\nPress, our law courts, our Government offices, and even in our fiction\r\nand poetry, suffer from the same one-sidedness. They hand down to\r\nposterity the most minute descriptions of every war, every battle and\r\nskirmish, every contest and act of violence, every kind of individual\r\nsuffering; but they hardly bear any trace of the countless acts of\r\nmutual support and devotion which every one of us knows from his own\r\nexperience; they hardly take notice of what makes the very essence of\r\nour daily life--our social instincts and manners. No wonder, then, if\r\nthe records of the past were so imperfect. The annalists of old never\r\nfailed to chronicle the petty wars and calamities which harassed their\r\ncontemporaries; but they paid no attention whatever to the life of the\r\nmasses, although the masses chiefly used to toil peacefully while the\r\nfew indulged in fighting. The epic poems, the inscriptions on monuments,\r\nthe treaties of peace--nearly all historical documents bear the same\r\ncharacter; they deal with breaches of peace, not with peace itself. So\r\nthat the best-intentioned historian unconsciously draws a distorted\r\npicture of the times he endeavours to depict; and, to restore the real\r\nproportion between conflict and union, we are now bound to enter into a\r\nminute analysis of thousands of small facts and faint indications\r\naccidentally preserved in the relics of the past; to interpret them with\r\nthe aid of comparative ethnology; and, after having heard so much about\r\nwhat used to divide men, to reconstruct stone by stone the institutions\r\nwhich used to unite them.\r\n\r\nEre long history will have to be re-written on new lines, so as to take\r\ninto account these two currents of human life and to appreciate the part\r\nplayed by each of them in evolution. But in the meantime we may avail\r\nourselves of the immense preparatory work recently done towards\r\nrestoring the leading features of the second current, so much neglected.\r\nFrom the better-known periods of history we may take some illustrations\r\nof the life of the masses, in order to indicate the part played by\r\nmutual support during those periods; and, in so doing, we may dispense\r\n(for the sake of brevity) from going as far back as the Egyptian, or\r\neven the Greek and Roman antiquity. For, in fact, the evolution of\r\nmankind has not had the character of one unbroken series. Several times\r\ncivilization came to an end in one given region, with one given race,\r\nand began anew elsewhere, among other races. But at each fresh start it\r\nbegan again with the same clan institutions which we have seen among the\r\nsavages. So that if we take the last start of our own civilization, when\r\nit began afresh in the first centuries of our era, among those whom the\r\nRomans called the \"barbarians,\" we shall have the whole scale of\r\nevolution, beginning with the gentes and ending in the institutions of\r\nour own time. To these illustrations the following pages will be\r\ndevoted.\r\n\r\nMen of science have not yet settled upon the causes which some two\r\nthousand years ago drove whole nations from Asia into Europe and\r\nresulted in the great migrations of barbarians which put an end to the\r\nWest Roman Empire. One cause, however, is naturally suggested to the\r\ngeographer as he contemplates the ruins of populous cities in the\r\ndeserts of Central Asia, or follows the old beds of rivers now\r\ndisappeared and the wide outlines of lakes now reduced to the size of\r\nmere ponds. It is desiccation: a quite recent desiccation, continued\r\nstill at a speed which we formerly were not prepared to admit.(1)\r\nAgainst it man was powerless. When the inhabitants of North-West\r\nMongolia and East Turkestan saw that water was abandoning them, they had\r\nno course open to them but to move down the broad valleys leading to the\r\nlowlands, and to thrust westwards the inhabitants of the plains.(2)\r\nStems after stems were thus thrown into Europe, compelling other stems\r\nto move and to remove for centuries in succession, westwards and\r\neastwards, in search of new and more or less permanent abodes. Races\r\nwere mixing with races during those migrations, aborigines with\r\nimmigrants, Aryans with Ural-Altayans; and it would have been no wonder\r\nif the social institutions which had kept them together in their mother\r\ncountries had been totally wrecked during the stratification of races\r\nwhich took place in Europe and Asia. But they were not wrecked; they\r\nsimply underwent the modification which was required by the new\r\nconditions of life.\r\n\r\nThe Teutons, the Celts, the Scandinavians, the Slavonians, and others,\r\nwhen they first came in contact with the Romans, were in a transitional\r\nstate of social organization. The clan unions, based upon a real or\r\nsupposed common origin, had kept them together for many thousands of\r\nyears in succession. But these unions could answer their purpose so long\r\nonly as there were no separate families within the gens or clan itself.\r\nHowever, for causes already mentioned, the separate patriarchal family\r\nhad slowly but steadily developed within the clans, and in the long run\r\nit evidently meant the individual accumulation of wealth and power, and\r\nthe hereditary transmission of both. The frequent migrations of the\r\nbarbarians and the ensuing wars only hastened the division of the gentes\r\ninto separate families, while the dispersing of stems and their mingling\r\nwith strangers offered singular facilities for the ultimate\r\ndisintegration of those unions which were based upon kinship. The\r\nbarbarians thus stood in a position of either seeing their clans\r\ndissolved into loose aggregations of families, of which the wealthiest,\r\nespecially if combining sacerdotal functions or military repute with\r\nwealth, would have succeeded in imposing their authority upon the\r\nothers; or of finding out some new form of organization based upon some\r\nnew principle.\r\n\r\nMany stems had no force to resist disintegration: they broke up and were\r\nlost for history. But the more vigorous ones did not disintegrate. They\r\ncame out of the ordeal with a new organization--the village\r\ncommunity--which kept them together for the next fifteen centuries or\r\nmore. The conception of a common territory, appropriated or protected by\r\ncommon efforts, was elaborated, and it took the place of the vanishing\r\nconceptions of common descent. The common gods gradually lost their\r\ncharacter of ancestors and were endowed with a local territorial\r\ncharacter. They became the gods or saints of a given locality; \"the\r\nland\" was identified with its inhabitants. Territorial unions grew up\r\ninstead of the consanguine unions of old, and this new organization\r\nevidently offered many advantages under the given circumstances. It\r\nrecognized the independence of the family and even emphasized it, the\r\nvillage community disclaiming all rights of interference in what was\r\ngoing on within the family enclosure; it gave much more freedom to\r\npersonal initiative; it was not hostile in principle to union between\r\nmen of different descent, and it maintained at the same time the\r\nnecessary cohesion of action and thought, while it was strong enough to\r\noppose the dominative tendencies of the minorities of wizards, priests,\r\nand professional or distinguished warriors. Consequently it became the\r\nprimary cell of future organization, and with many nations the village\r\ncommunity has retained this character until now.\r\n\r\nIt is now known, and scarcely contested, that the village community was\r\nnot a specific feature of the Slavonians, nor even of the ancient\r\nTeutons. It prevailed in England during both the Saxon and Norman times,\r\nand partially survived till the last century;(3) it was at the bottom of\r\nthe social organization of old Scotland, old Ireland, and old Wales. In\r\nFrance, the communal possession and the communal allotment of arable\r\nland by the village folkmote persisted from the first centuries of our\r\nera till the times of Turgot, who found the folkmotes \"too noisy\" and\r\ntherefore abolished them. It survived Roman rule in Italy, and revived\r\nafter the fall of the Roman Empire. It was the rule with the\r\nScandinavians, the Slavonians, the Finns (in the pittaya, as also,\r\nprobably, the kihla-kunta), the Coures, and the lives. The village\r\ncommunity in India--past and present, Aryan and non-Aryan--is well known\r\nthrough the epoch-making works of Sir Henry Maine; and Elphinstone has\r\ndescribed it among the Afghans. We also find it in the Mongolian oulous,\r\nthe Kabyle thaddart, the Javanese dessa, the Malayan kota or tofa, and\r\nunder a variety of names in Abyssinia, the Soudan, in the interior of\r\nAfrica, with natives of both Americas, with all the small and large\r\ntribes of the Pacific archipelagoes. In short, we do not know one single\r\nhuman race or one single nation which has not had its period of village\r\ncommunities. This fact alone disposes of the theory according to which\r\nthe village community in Europe would have been a servile growth. It is\r\nanterior to serfdom, and even servile submission was powerless to break\r\nit. It was a universal phase of evolution, a natural outcome of the clan\r\norganization, with all those stems, at least, which have played, or play\r\nstill, some part in history.(4)\r\n\r\nIt was a natural growth, and an absolute uniformity in its structure was\r\ntherefore not possible. As a rule, it was a union between families\r\nconsidered as of common descent and owning a certain territory in\r\ncommon. But with some stems, and under certain circumstances, the\r\nfamilies used to grow very numerous before they threw off new buds in\r\nthe shape of new families; five, six, or seven generations continued to\r\nlive under the same roof, or within the same enclosure, owning their\r\njoint household and cattle in common, and taking their meals at the\r\ncommon hearth. They kept in such case to what ethnology knows as the\r\n\"joint family,\" or the \"undivided household,\" which we still see all\r\nover China, in India, in the South Slavonian zadruga, and occasionally\r\nfind in Africa, in America, in Denmark, in North Russia, and West\r\nFrance.(5) With other stems, or in other circumstances, not yet well\r\nspecified, the families did not attain the same proportions; the\r\ngrandsons, and occasionally the sons, left the household as soon as they\r\nwere married, and each of them started a new cell of his own. But, joint\r\nor not, clustered together or scattered in the woods, the families\r\nremained united into village communities; several villages were grouped\r\ninto tribes; and the tribes joined into confederations. Such was the\r\nsocial organization which developed among the so-called \"barbarians,\"\r\nwhen they began to settle more or less permanently in Europe.\r\n\r\nA very long evolution was required before the gentes, or clans,\r\nrecognized the separate existence of a patriarchal family in a separate\r\nhut; but even after that had been recognized, the clan, as a rule, knew\r\nno personal inheritance of property. The few things which might have\r\nbelonged personally to the individual were either destroyed on his grave\r\nor buried with him. The village community, on the contrary, fully\r\nrecognized the private accumulation of wealth within the family and its\r\nhereditary transmission. But wealth was conceived exclusively in the\r\nshape of movable property, including cattle, implements, arms, and the\r\ndwelling house which--\"like all things that can be destroyed by\r\nfire\"--belonged to the same category(6). As to private property in land,\r\nthe village community did not, and could not, recognize anything of the\r\nkind, and, as a rule, it does not recognize it now. The land was the\r\ncommon property of the tribe, or of the whole stem, and the village\r\ncommunity itself owned its part of the tribal territory so long only as\r\nthe tribe did not claim a re-distribution of the village allotments. The\r\nclearing of the woods and the breaking of the prairies being mostly done\r\nby the communities or, at least, by the joint work of several\r\nfamilies--always with the consent of the community--the cleared plots\r\nwere held by each family for a term of four, twelve, or twenty years,\r\nafter which term they were treated as parts of the arable land owned in\r\ncommon. Private property, or possession \"for ever\" was as incompatible,\r\nwith the very principles and the religious conceptions of the village\r\ncommunity as it was with the principles of the gens; so that a long\r\ninfluence of the Roman law and the Christian Church, which soon accepted\r\nthe Roman principles, were required to accustom the barbarians to the\r\nidea of private property in land being possible.(7) And yet, even when\r\nsuch property, or possession for an unlimited time, was recognized, the\r\nowner of a separate estate remained a co-proprietor in the waste lands,\r\nforests, and grazing-grounds. Moreover, we continually see, especially\r\nin the history of Russia, that when a few families, acting separately,\r\nhad taken possession of some land belonging to tribes which were treated\r\nas strangers, they very soon united together, and constituted a village\r\ncommunity which in the third or fourth generation began to profess a\r\ncommunity of origin.\r\n\r\nA whole series of institutions, partly inherited from the clan period,\r\nhave developed from that basis of common ownership of land during the\r\nlong succession of centuries which was required to bring the barbarians\r\nunder the dominion of States organized upon the Roman or Byzantine\r\npattern. The village community was not only a union for guaranteeing to\r\neach one his fair share in the common land, but also a union for common\r\nculture, for mutual support in all possible forms, for protection from\r\nviolence, and for a further development of knowledge, national bonds,\r\nand moral conceptions; and every change in the judicial, military,\r\neducational, or economical manners had to be decided at the folkmotes of\r\nthe village, the tribe, or the confederation. The community being a\r\ncontinuation of the gens, it inherited all its functions. It was the\r\nuniversitas, the mir--a world in itself.\r\n\r\nCommon hunting, common fishing, and common culture of the orchards or\r\nthe plantations of fruit trees was the rule with the old gentes. Common\r\nagriculture became the rule in the barbarian village communities. True,\r\nthat direct testimony to this effect is scarce, and in the literature of\r\nantiquity we only have the passages of Diodorus and Julius Caesar\r\nrelating to the inhabitants of the Lipari Islands, one of the\r\nCelt-Iberian tribes, and the Sueves. But there is no lack of evidence to\r\nprove that common agriculture was practised among some Teuton tribes,\r\nthe Franks, and the old Scotch, Irish, and Welsh.(8) As to the later\r\nsurvivals of the same practice, they simply are countless. Even in\r\nperfectly Romanized France, common culture was habitual some five and\r\ntwenty years ago in the Morbihan (Brittany).(9) The old Welsh cyvar, or\r\njoint team, as well as the common culture of the land allotted to the\r\nuse of the village sanctuary are quite common among the tribes of\r\nCaucasus the least touched by civilization,(10) and like facts are of\r\ndaily occurrence among the Russian peasants. Moreover, it is well known\r\nthat many tribes of Brazil, Central America, and Mexico used to\r\ncultivate their fields in common, and that the same habit is widely\r\nspread among some Malayans, in New Caledonia, with several Negro stems,\r\nand so on.(11) In short, communal culture is so habitual with many\r\nAryan, Ural-Altayan, Mongolian, Negro, Red Indian, Malayan, and\r\nMelanesian stems that we must consider it as a universal--though not as\r\nthe only possible--form of primitive agriculture.(12)\r\n\r\nCommunal cultivation does not, however, imply by necessity communal\r\nconsumption. Already under the clan organization we often see that when\r\nthe boats laden with fruits or fish return to the village, the food they\r\nbring in is divided among the huts and the \"long houses\" inhabited by\r\neither several families or the youth, and is cooked separately at each\r\nseparate hearth. The habit of taking meals in a narrower circle of\r\nrelatives or associates thus prevails at an early period of clan life.\r\nIt became the rule in the village community. Even the food grown in\r\ncommon was usually divided between the households after part of it had\r\nbeen laid in store for communal use. However, the tradition of communal\r\nmeals was piously kept alive; every available opportunity, such as the\r\ncommemoration of the ancestors, the religious festivals, the beginning\r\nand the end of field work, the births, the marriages, and the funerals,\r\nbeing seized upon to bring the community to a common meal. Even now this\r\nhabit, well known in this country as the \"harvest supper,\" is the last\r\nto disappear. On the other hand, even when the fields had long since\r\nceased to be tilled and sown in common, a variety of agricultural work\r\ncontinued, and continues still, to be performed by the community. Some\r\npart of the communal land is still cultivated in many cases in common,\r\neither for the use of the destitute, or for refilling the communal\r\nstores, or for using the produce at the religious festivals. The\r\nirrigation canals are digged and repaired in common. The communal\r\nmeadows are mown by the community; and the sight of a Russian commune\r\nmowing a meadow--the men rivalling each other in their advance with the\r\nscythe, while the women turn the grass over and throw it up into\r\nheaps--is one of the most inspiring sights; it shows what human work\r\nmight be and ought to be. The hay, in such case, is divided among the\r\nseparate households, and it is evident that no one has the right of\r\ntaking hay from a neighbour's stack without his permission; but the\r\nlimitation of this last rule among the Caucasian Ossetes is most\r\nnoteworthy. When the cuckoo cries and announces that spring is coming,\r\nand that the meadows will soon be clothed again with grass, every one in\r\nneed has the right of taking from a neighbour's stack the hay he wants\r\nfor his cattle.(13) The old communal rights are thus re-asserted, as if\r\nto prove how contrary unbridled individualism is to human nature.\r\n\r\nWhen the European traveller lands in some small island of the Pacific,\r\nand, seeing at a distance a grove of palm trees, walks in that\r\ndirection, he is astonished to discover that the little villages are\r\nconnected by roads paved with big stones, quite comfortable for the\r\nunshod natives, and very similar to the \"old roads\" of the Swiss\r\nmountains. Such roads were traced by the \"barbarians\" all over Europe,\r\nand one must have travelled in wild, thinly-peopled countries, far away\r\nfrom the chief lines of communication, to realize in full the immense\r\nwork that must have been performed by the barbarian communities in order\r\nto conquer the woody and marshy wilderness which Europe was some two\r\nthousand years ago. Isolated families, having no tools, and weak as they\r\nwere, could not have conquered it; the wilderness would have overpowered\r\nthem. Village communities alone, working in common, could master the\r\nwild forests, the sinking marshes, and the endless steppes. The rough\r\nroads, the ferries, the wooden bridges taken away in the winter and\r\nrebuilt after the spring flood was over, the fences and the palisaded\r\nwalls of the villages, the earthen forts and the small towers with which\r\nthe territory was dottedall these were the work of the barbarian\r\ncommunities. And when a community grew numerous it used to throw off a\r\nnew bud. A new community arose at a distance, thus step by step bringing\r\nthe woods and the steppes under the dominion of man. The whole making of\r\nEuropean nations was such a budding of the village communities. Even\r\nnow-a-days the Russian peasants, if they are not quite broken down by\r\nmisery, migrate in communities, and they till the soil and build the\r\nhouses in com mon when they settle on the banks of the Amur, or in\r\nManitoba. And even the English, when they first began to colonize\r\nAmerica, used to return to the old system; they grouped into village\r\ncommunities.(14)\r\n\r\nThe village community was the chief arm of the barbarians in their hard\r\nstruggle against a hostile nature. It also was the bond they opposed to\r\noppression by the cunningest and the strongest which so easily might\r\nhave developed during those disturbed times. The imaginary\r\nbarbarian--the man who fights and kills at his mere caprice--existed no\r\nmore than the \"bloodthirsty\" savage. The real barbarian was living, on\r\nthe contrary, under a wide series of institutions, imbued with\r\nconsiderations as to what may be useful or noxious to his tribe or\r\nconfederation, and these institutions were piously handed down from\r\ngeneration to generation in verses and songs, in proverbs or triads, in\r\nsentences and instructions. The more we study them the more we recognize\r\nthe narrow bonds which united men in their villages. Every quarrel\r\narising between two individuals was treated as a communal affair--even\r\nthe offensive words that might have been uttered during a quarrel being\r\nconsidered as an offence to the community and its ancestors. They had to\r\nbe repaired by amends made both to the individual and the community;(15)\r\nand if a quarrel ended in a fight and wounds, the man who stood by and\r\ndid not interpose was treated as if he himself had inflicted the\r\nwounds.(16) The judicial procedure was imbued with the same spirit.\r\nEvery dispute was brought first before mediators or arbiters, and it\r\nmostly ended with them, the arbiters playing a very important part in\r\nbarbarian society. But if the case was too grave to be settled in this\r\nway, it came before the folkmote, which was bound \"to find the\r\nsentence,\" and pronounced it in a conditional form; that is, \"such\r\ncompensation was due, if the wrong be proved,\" and the wrong had to be\r\nproved or disclaimed by six or twelve persons confirming or denying the\r\nfact by oath; ordeal being resorted to in case of contradiction between\r\nthe two sets of jurors. Such procedure, which remained in force for more\r\nthan two thousand years in succession, speaks volumes for itself; it\r\nshows how close were the bonds between all members of the community.\r\nMoreover, there was no other authority to enforce the decisions of the\r\nfolkmote besides its own moral authority. The only possible menace was\r\nthat the community might declare the rebel an outlaw, but even this\r\nmenace was reciprocal. A man discontented with the folkmote could\r\ndeclare that he would abandon the tribe and go over to another tribe--a\r\nmost dreadful menace, as it was sure to bring all kinds of misfortunes\r\nupon a tribe that might have been unfair to one of its members.(17) A\r\nrebellion against a right decision of the customary law was simply\r\n\"inconceivable,\" as Henry Maine has so well said, because \"law,\r\nmorality, and fact\" could not be separated from each other in those\r\ntimes.(18) The moral authority of the commune was so great that even at\r\na much later epoch, when the village communities fell into submission to\r\nthe feudal lord, they maintained their judicial powers; they only\r\npermitted the lord, or his deputy, to \"find\" the above conditional\r\nsentence in accordance with the customary law he had sworn to follow,\r\nand to levy for himself the fine (the fred) due to the commune. But for\r\na long time, the lord himself, if he remained a co-proprietor in the\r\nwaste land of the commune, submitted in communal affairs to its\r\ndecisions. Noble or ecclesiastic, he had to submit to the folkmote--Wer\r\ndaselbst Wasser und Weid genusst, muss gehorsam sein--\"Who enjoys here\r\nthe right of water and pasture must obey\"--was the old saying. Even when\r\nthe peasants became serfs under the lord, he was bound to appear before\r\nthe folkmote when they summoned him.(19)\r\n\r\nIn their conceptions of justice the barbarians evidently did not much\r\ndiffer from the savages. They also maintained the idea that a murder\r\nmust be followed by putting the murderer to death; that wounds had to be\r\npunished by equal wounds, and that the wronged family was bound to\r\nfulfil the sentence of the customary law. This was a holy duty, a duty\r\ntowards the ancestors, which had to be accomplished in broad daylight,\r\nnever in secrecy, and rendered widely known. Therefore the most inspired\r\npassages of the sagas and epic poetry altogether are those which glorify\r\nwhat was supposed to be justice. The gods themselves joined in aiding\r\nit. However, the predominant feature of barbarian justice is, on the one\r\nhand, to limit the numbers of persons who may be involved in a feud,\r\nand, on the other hand, to extirpate the brutal idea of blood for blood\r\nand wounds for wounds, by substituting for it the system of\r\ncompensation. The barbarian codes which were collections of common law\r\nrules written down for the use of judges--\"first permitted, then\r\nencouraged, and at last enforced,\" compensation instead of revenge.(20)\r\nThe compensation has, however, been totally misunderstood by those who\r\nrepresented it as a fine, and as a sort of carte blanche given to the\r\nrich man to do whatever he liked. The compensation money (wergeld),\r\nwhich was quite different from the fine or fred,(21) was habitually so\r\nhigh for all kinds of active offences that it certainly was no\r\nencouragement for such offences. In case of a murder it usually exceeded\r\nall the possible fortune of the murderer \"Eighteen times eighteen cows\"\r\nis the compensation with the Ossetes who do not know how to reckon above\r\neighteen, while with the African tribes it attains 800 cows or 100\r\ncamels with their young, or 416 sheep in the poorer tribes.(22) In the\r\ngreat majority of cases, the compensation money could not be paid at\r\nall, so that the murderer had no issue but to induce the wronged family,\r\nby repentance, to adopt him. Even now, in the Caucasus, when feuds come\r\nto an end, the offender touches with his lips the breast of the oldest\r\nwoman of the tribe, and becomes a \"milk-brother\" to all men of the\r\nwronged family.(23) With several African tribes he must give his\r\ndaughter, or sister, in marriage to some one of the family; with other\r\ntribes he is bound to marry the woman whom he has made a widow; and in\r\nall cases he becomes a member of the family, whose opinion is taken in\r\nall important family matters.(24)\r\n\r\nFar from acting with disregard to human life, the barbarians, moreover,\r\nknew nothing of the horrid punishments introduced at a later epoch by\r\nthe laic and canonic laws under Roman and Byzantine influence. For, if\r\nthe Saxon code admitted the death penalty rather freely even in cases of\r\nincendiarism and armed robbery, the other barbarian codes pronounced it\r\nexclusively in cases of betrayal of one's kin, and sacrilege against the\r\ncommunity's gods, as the only means to appease the gods.\r\n\r\nAll this, as seen is very far from the supposed \"moral dissoluteness\" of\r\nthe barbarians. On the contrary, we cannot but admire the deeply moral\r\nprinciples elaborated within the early village communities which found\r\ntheir expression in Welsh triads, in legends about King Arthur, in\r\nBrehon commentaries,(25) in old German legends and so on, or find still\r\ntheir expression in the sayings of the modern barbarians. In his\r\nintroduction to The Story of Burnt Njal, George Dasent very justly sums\r\nup as follows the qualities of a Northman, as they appear in the\r\nsagas:--\r\n\r\n     To do what lay before him openly and like a man, without fear of\r\n     either foes, fiends, or fate; ... to be free and daring in all his\r\n     deeds; to be gentle and generous to his friends and kinsmen; to be\r\n     stern and grim to his foes [those who are under the lex talionis],\r\n     but even towards them to fulfil all bounden duties.... To be no\r\n     truce-breaker, nor tale-bearer, nor backbiter. To utter nothing\r\n     against any man that he would not dare to tell him to his face. To\r\n     turn no man from his door who sought food or shelter, even though\r\n     he were a foe.(26)\r\n\r\nThe same or still better principles permeate the Welsh epic poetry and\r\ntriads. To act \"according to the nature of mildness and the principles\r\nof equity,\" without regard to the foes or to the friends, and \"to repair\r\nthe wrong,\" are the highest duties of man; \"evil is death, good is\r\nlife,\" exclaims the poet legislator.(27) \"The World would be fool, if\r\nagreements made on lips were not honourable\"--the Brehon law says. And\r\nthe humble Shamanist Mordovian, after having praised the same qualities,\r\nwill add, moreover, in his principles of customary law, that \"among\r\nneighbours the cow and the milking-jar are in common;\" that, \"the cow\r\nmust be milked for yourself and him who may ask milk;\" that \"the body of\r\na child reddens from the stroke, but the face of him who strikes reddens\r\nfrom shame;\"(28) and so on. Many pages might be filled with like\r\nprinciples expressed and followed by the \"barbarians.\"\r\n\r\nOne feature more of the old village communities deserves a special\r\nmention. It is the gradual extension of the circle of men embraced by\r\nthe feelings of solidarity. Not only the tribes federated into stems,\r\nbut the stems as well, even though of different origin, joined together\r\nin confederations. Some unions were so close that, for instance, the\r\nVandals, after part of their confederation had left for the Rhine, and\r\nthence went over to Spain and Africa, respected for forty consecutive\r\nyears the landmarks and the abandoned villages of their confederates,\r\nand did not take possession of them until they had ascertained through\r\nenvoys that their confederates did not intend to return. With other\r\nbarbarians, the soil was cultivated by one part of the stem, while the\r\nother part fought on or beyond the frontiers of the common territory. As\r\nto the leagues between several stems, they were quite habitual. The\r\nSicambers united with the Cherusques and the Sueves, the Quades with the\r\nSarmates; the Sarmates with the Alans, the Carpes, and the Huns. Later\r\non, we also see the conception of nations gradually developing in\r\nEurope, long before anything like a State had grown in any part of the\r\ncontinent occupied by the barbarians. These nations--for it is\r\nimpossible to refuse the name of a nation to the Merovingian France, or\r\nto the Russia of the eleventh and twelfth century--were nevertheless\r\nkept together by nothing else but a community of language, and a tacit\r\nagreement of the small republics to take their dukes from none but one\r\nspecial family.\r\n\r\nWars were certainly unavoidable; migration means war; but Sir Henry\r\nMaine has already fully proved in his remarkable study of the tribal\r\norigin of International Law, that \"Man has never been so ferocious or so\r\nstupid as to submit to such an evil as war without some kind of effort\r\nto prevent it,\" and he has shown how exceedingly great is \"the number of\r\nancient institutions which bear the marks of a design to stand in the\r\nway of war, or to provide an alternative to it.\"(29) In reality, man is\r\nso far from the warlike being he is supposed to be, that when the\r\nbarbarians had once settled they so rapidly lost the very habits of\r\nwarfare that very soon they were compelled to keep special dukes\r\nfollowed by special scholae or bands of warriors, in order to protect\r\nthem from possible intruders. They preferred peaceful toil to war, the\r\nvery peacefulness of man being the cause of the specialization of the\r\nwarrior's trade, which specialization resulted later on in serfdom and\r\nin all the wars of the \"States period\" of human history.\r\n\r\nHistory finds great difficulties in restoring to life the institutions\r\nof the barbarians. At every step the historian meets with some faint\r\nindication which he is unable to explain with the aid of his own\r\ndocuments only. But a broad light is thrown on the past as soon as we\r\nrefer to the institutions of the very numerous tribes which are still\r\nliving under a social organization almost identical with that of our\r\nbarbarian ancestors. Here we simply have the difficulty of choice,\r\nbecause the islands of the Pacific, the steppes of Asia, and the\r\ntablelands of Africa are real historical museums containing specimens of\r\nall possible intermediate stages which mankind has lived through, when\r\npassing from the savage gentes up to the States' organization. Let us,\r\nthen, examine a few of those specimens.\r\n\r\nIf we take the village communities of the Mongol Buryates, especially\r\nthose of the Kudinsk Steppe on the upper Lena which have better escaped\r\nRussian influence, we have fair representatives of barbarians in a\r\ntransitional state, between cattle-breeding and agriculture.(30) These\r\nBuryates are still living in \"joint families\"; that is, although each\r\nson, when he is married, goes to live in a separate hut, the huts of at\r\nleast three generations remain within the same enclosure, and the joint\r\nfamily work in common in their fields, and own in common their joint\r\nhouseholds and their cattle, as well as their \"calves' grounds\" (small\r\nfenced patches of soil kept under soft grass for the rearing of calves).\r\nAs a rule, the meals are taken separately in each hut; but when meat is\r\nroasted, all the twenty to sixty members of the joint household feast\r\ntogether. Several joint households which live in a cluster, as well as\r\nseveral smaller families settled in the same village--mostly debris of\r\njoint households accidentally broken up--make the oulous, or the village\r\ncommunity; several oulouses make a tribe; and the forty-six tribes, or\r\nclans, of the Kudinsk Steppe are united into one confederation. Smaller\r\nand closer confederations are entered into, as necessity arises for\r\nspecial wants, by several tribes. They know no private property in\r\nland--the land being held in common by the oulous, or rather by the\r\nconfederation, and if it becomes necessary, the territory is re-allotted\r\nbetween the different oulouses at a folkmote of the tribe, and between\r\nthe forty-six tribes at a folkmote of the confederation. It is worthy of\r\nnote that the same organization prevails among all the 250,000 Buryates\r\nof East Siberia, although they have been for three centuries under\r\nRussian rule, and are well acquainted with Russian institutions.\r\n\r\nWith all that, inequalities of fortune rapidly develop among the\r\nBuryates, especially since the Russian Government is giving an\r\nexaggerated importance to their elected taishas (princes), whom it\r\nconsiders as responsible tax-collectors and representatives of the\r\nconfederations in their administrative and even commercial relations\r\nwith the Russians. The channels for the enrichment of the few are thus\r\nmany, while the impoverishment of the great number goes hand in hand,\r\nthrough the appropriation of the Buryate lands by the Russians. But it\r\nis a habit with the Buryates, especially those of Kudinsk--and habit is\r\nmore than law--that if a family has lost its cattle, the richer families\r\ngive it some cows and horses that it may recover. As to the destitute\r\nman who has no family, he takes his meals in the huts of his congeners;\r\nhe enters a hut, takes--by right, not for charity--his seat by the fire,\r\nand shares the meal which always is scrupulously divided into equal\r\nparts; he sleeps where he has taken his evening meal. Altogether, the\r\nRussian conquerors of Siberia were so much struck by the communistic\r\npractices of the Buryates, that they gave them the name of\r\nBratskiye--\"the Brotherly Ones\"--and reported to Moscow. \"With them\r\neverything is in common; whatever they have is shared in common.\" Even\r\nnow, when the Lena Buryates sell their wheat, or send some of their\r\ncattle to be sold to a Russian butcher, the families of the oulous, or\r\nthe tribe, put their wheat and cattle together, and sell it as a whole.\r\nEach oulous has, moreover, its grain store for loans in case of need,\r\nits communal baking oven (the four banal of the old French communities),\r\nand its blacksmith, who, like the blacksmith of the Indian\r\ncommunities,(31) being a member of the community, is never paid for his\r\nwork within the community. He must make it for nothing, and if he\r\nutilizes his spare time for fabricating the small plates of chiselled\r\nand silvered iron which are used in Buryate land for the decoration of\r\ndress, he may occasionally sell them to a woman from another clan, but\r\nto the women of his own clan the attire is presented as a gift. Selling\r\nand buying cannot take place within the community, and the rule is so\r\nsevere that when a richer family hires a labourer the labourer must be\r\ntaken from another clan or from among the Russians. This habit is\r\nevidently not specific to the Buryates; it is so widely spread among the\r\nmodern barbarians, Aryan and Ural-Altayan, that it must have been\r\nuniversal among our ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of union within the confederation is kept alive by the\r\ncommon interests of the tribes, their folkmotes, and the festivities\r\nwhich are usually kept in connection with the folkmotes. The same\r\nfeeling is, however, maintained by another institution, the aba, or\r\ncommon hunt, which is a reminiscence of a very remote past. Every\r\nautumn, the forty-six clans of Kudinsk come together for such a hunt,\r\nthe produce of which is divided among all the families. Moreover,\r\nnational abas, to assert the unity of the whole Buryate nation, are\r\nconvoked from time to time. In such cases, all Buryate clans which are\r\nscattered for hundreds of miles west and east of Lake Baikal, are bound\r\nto send their delegate hunters. Thousands of men come together, each one\r\nbringing provisions for a whole month. Every one's share must be equal\r\nto all the others, and therefore, before being put together, they are\r\nweighed by an elected elder (always \"with the hand\": scales would be a\r\nprofanation of the old custom). After that the hunters divide into bands\r\nof twenty, and the parties go hunting according to a well-settled plan.\r\nIn such abas the entire Buryate nation revives its epic traditions of a\r\ntime when it was united in a powerful league. Let me add that such\r\ncommunal hunts are quite usual with the Red Indians and the Chinese on\r\nthe banks of the Usuri (the kada).(32)\r\n\r\nWith the Kabyles, whose manners of life have been so well described by\r\ntwo French explorers,(33) we have barbarians still more advanced in\r\nagriculture. Their fields, irrigated and manured, are well attended to,\r\nand in the hilly tracts every available plot of land is cultivated by\r\nthe spade. The Kabyles have known many vicissitudes in their history;\r\nthey have followed for sometime the Mussulman law of inheritance, but,\r\nbeing adverse to it, they have returned, 150 years ago, to the tribal\r\ncustomary law of old. Accordingly, their land-tenure is of a mixed\r\ncharacter, and private property in land exists side by side with\r\ncommunal possession. Still, the basis of their present organization is\r\nthe village community, the thaddart, which usually consists of several\r\njoint families (kharoubas), claiming a community of origin, as well as\r\nof smaller families of strangers. Several villages are grouped into\r\nclans or tribes (arch); several tribes make the confederation\r\n(thak'ebilt); and several confederations may occasionally enter into a\r\nleague, chiefly for purposes of armed defence.\r\n\r\nThe Kabyles know no authority whatever besides that of the djemmaa, or\r\nfolkmote of the village community. All men of age take part in it, in\r\nthe open air, or in a special building provided with stone seats. And\r\nthe decisions of the djemmaa are evidently taken at unanimity: that is,\r\nthe discussions continue until all present agree to accept, or to submit\r\nto, some decision. There being no authority in a village community to\r\nimpose a decision, this system has been practised by mankind wherever\r\nthere have been village communities, and it is practised still wherever\r\nthey continue to exist, i.e. by several hundred million men all over the\r\nworld. The djemmaa nominates its executive--the elder, the scribe, and\r\nthe treasurer; it assesses its own taxes; and it manages the repartition\r\nof the common lands, as well as all kinds of works of public utility. A\r\ngreat deal of work is done in common: the roads, the mosques, the\r\nfountains, the irrigation canals, the towers erected for protection from\r\nrobbers, the fences, and so on, are built by the village community;\r\nwhile the high-roads, the larger mosques, and the great market-places\r\nare the work of the tribe. Many traces of common culture continue to\r\nexist, and the houses continue to be built by, or with the aid of, all\r\nmen and women of the village. Altogether, the \"aids\" are of daily\r\noccurrence, and are continually called in for the cultivation of the\r\nfields, for harvesting, and so on. As to the skilled work, each\r\ncommunity has its blacksmith, who enjoys his part of the communal land,\r\nand works for the community; when the tilling season approaches he\r\nvisits every house, and repairs the tools and the ploughs, without\r\nexpecting any pay, while the making of new ploughs is considered as a\r\npious work which can by no means be recompensed in money, or by any\r\nother form of salary.\r\n\r\nAs the Kabyles already have private property, they evidently have both\r\nrich and poor among them. But like all people who closely live together,\r\nand know how poverty begins, they consider it as an accident which may\r\nvisit every one. \"Don't say that you will never wear the beggar's bag,\r\nnor go to prison,\" is a proverb of the Russian peasants; the Kabyles\r\npractise it, and no difference can be detected in the external behaviour\r\nbetween rich and poor; when the poor convokes an \"aid,\" the rich man\r\nworks in his field, just as the poor man does it reciprocally in his\r\nturn.(34) Moreover, the djemmaas set aside certain gardens and fields,\r\nsometimes cultivated in common, for the use of the poorest members. Many\r\nlike customs continue to exist. As the poorer families would not be able\r\nto buy meat, meat is regularly bought with the money of the fines, or\r\nthe gifts to the djemmaa, or the payments for the use of the communal\r\nolive-oil basins, and it is distributed in equal parts among those who\r\ncannot afford buying meat themselves. And when a sheep or a bullock is\r\nkilled by a family for its own use on a day which is not a market day,\r\nthe fact is announced in the streets by the village crier, in order that\r\nsick people and pregnant women may take of it what they want. Mutual\r\nsupport permeates the life of the Kabyles, and if one of them, during a\r\njourney abroad, meets with another Kabyle in need, he is bound to come\r\nto his aid, even at the risk of his own fortune and life; if this has\r\nnot been done, the djemmaa of the man who has suffered from such neglect\r\nmay lodge a complaint, and the djemmaa of the selfish man will at once\r\nmake good the loss. We thus come across a custom which is familiar to\r\nthe students of the mediaeval merchant guilds. Every stranger who enters\r\na Kabyle village has right to housing in the winter, and his horses can\r\nalways graze on the communal lands for twenty-four hours. But in case of\r\nneed he can reckon upon an almost unlimited support. Thus, during the\r\nfamine of 1867-68, the Kabyles received and fed every one who sought\r\nrefuge in their villages, without distinction of origin. In the district\r\nof Dellys, no less than 12,000 people who came from all parts of\r\nAlgeria, and even from Morocco, were fed in this way. While people died\r\nfrom starvation all over Algeria, there was not one single case of death\r\ndue to this cause on Kabylian soil. The djemmaas, depriving themselves\r\nof necessaries, organized relief, without ever asking any aid from the\r\nGovernment, or uttering the slightest complaint; they considered it as a\r\nnatural duty. And while among the European settlers all kind of police\r\nmeasures were taken to prevent thefts and disorder resulting from such\r\nan influx of strangers, nothing of the kind was required on the Kabyles'\r\nterritory: the djemmaas needed neither aid nor protection from\r\nwithout.(35)\r\n\r\nI can only cursorily mention two other most interesting features of\r\nKabyle life; namely, the anaya, or protection granted to wells, canals,\r\nmosques, marketplaces, some roads, and so on, in case of war, and the\r\ncofs. In the anaya we have a series of institutions both for diminishing\r\nthe evils of war and for preventing conflicts. Thus the market-place is\r\nanaya, especially if it stands on a frontier and brings Kabyles and\r\nstrangers together; no one dares disturb peace in the market, and if a\r\ndisturbance arises, it is quelled at once by the strangers who have\r\ngathered in the market town. The road upon which the women go from the\r\nvillage to the fountain also is anaya in case of war; and so on. As to\r\nthe cof it is a widely spread form of association, having some\r\ncharacters of the mediaeval Burgschaften or Gegilden, as well as of\r\nsocieties both for mutual protection and for various\r\npurposes--intellectual, political, and emotional--which cannot be\r\nsatisfied by the territorial organization of the village, the clan, and\r\nthe con federation. The cof knows no territorial limits; it recruits its\r\nmembers in various villages, even among strangers; and it protects them\r\nin all possible eventualities of life. Altogether, it is an attempt at\r\nsupplementing the territorial grouping by an extra-territorial grouping\r\nintended to give an expression to mutual affinities of all kinds across\r\nthe frontiers. The free international association of individual tastes\r\nand ideas, which we consider as one of the best features of our own\r\nlife, has thus its origin in barbarian antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe mountaineers of Caucasia offer another extremely instructive field\r\nfor illustrations of the same kind. In studying the present customs of\r\nthe Ossetes--their joint families and communes and their judiciary\r\nconceptions--Professor Kovalevsky, in a remarkable work on Modern Custom\r\nand Ancient Law was enabled step by step to trace the similar\r\ndispositions of the old barbarian codes and even to study the origins of\r\nfeudalism. With other Caucasian stems we occasionally catch a glimpse\r\ninto the origin of the village community in those cases where it was not\r\ntribal but originated from a voluntary union between families of\r\ndistinct origin. Such was recently the case with some Khevsoure\r\nvillages, the inhabitants of which took the oath of \"community and\r\nfraternity.\"(36) In another part of Caucasus, Daghestan, we see the\r\ngrowth of feudal relations between two tribes, both maintaining at the\r\nsame time their village communities (and even traces of the gentile\r\n\"classes\"), and thus giving a living illustration of the forms taken by\r\nthe conquest of Italy and Gaul by the barbarians. The victorious race,\r\nthe Lezghines, who have conquered several Georgian and Tartar villages\r\nin the Zakataly district, did not bring them under the dominion of\r\nseparate families; they constituted a feudal clan which now includes\r\n12,000 households in three villages, and owns in common no less than\r\ntwenty Georgian and Tartar villages. The conquerors divided their own\r\nland among their clans, and the clans divided it in equal parts among\r\nthe families; but they did not interfere with the djemmaas of their\r\ntributaries which still practise the habit mentioned by Julius Caesar;\r\nnamely, the djemmaa decides each year which part of the communal\r\nterritory must be cultivated, and this land is divided into as many\r\nparts as there are families, and the parts are distributed by lot. It is\r\nworthy of note that although proletarians are of common occurrence among\r\nthe Lezghines (who live under a system of private property in land, and\r\ncommon ownership of serfs(37)) they are rare among their Georgian serfs,\r\nwho continue to hold their land in common. As to the customary law of\r\nthe Caucasian mountaineers, it is much the same as that of the\r\nLongobards or Salic Franks, and several of its dispositions explain a\r\ngood deal the judicial procedure of the barbarians of old. Being of a\r\nvery impressionable character, they do their best to prevent quarrels\r\nfrom taking a fatal issue; so, with the Khevsoures, the swords are very\r\nsoon drawn when a quarrel breaks out; but if a woman rushes out and\r\nthrows among them the piece of linen which she wears on her head, the\r\nswords are at once returned to their sheaths, and the quarrel is\r\nappeased. The head-dress of the women is anaya. If a quarrel has not\r\nbeen stopped in time and has ended in murder, the compensation money is\r\nso considerable that the aggressor is entirely ruined for his life,\r\nunless he is adopted by the wronged family; and if he has resorted to\r\nhis sword in a trifling quarrel and has inflicted wounds, he loses for\r\never the consideration of his kin. In all disputes, mediators take the\r\nmatter in hand; they select from among the members of the clan the\r\njudges--six in smaller affairs, and from ten to fifteen in more serious\r\nmatters--and Russian observers testify to the absolute incorruptibility\r\nof the judges. An oath has such a significance that men enjoying general\r\nesteem are dispensed from taking it: a simple affirmation is quite\r\nsufficient, the more so as in grave affairs the Khevsoure never\r\nhesitates to recognize his guilt (I mean, of course, the Khevsoure\r\nuntouched yet by civilization). The oath is chiefly reserved for such\r\ncases, like disputes about property, which require some sort of\r\nappreciation in addition to a simple statement of facts; and in such\r\ncases the men whose affirmation will decide in the dispute, act with the\r\ngreatest circumspection. Altogether it is certainly not a want of\r\nhonesty or of respect to the rights of the congeners which characterizes\r\nthe barbarian societies of Caucasus.\r\n\r\nThe stems of Africa offer such an immense variety of extremely\r\ninteresting societies standing at all intermediate stages from the early\r\nvillage community to the despotic barbarian monarchies that I must\r\nabandon the idea of giving here even the chief results of a comparative\r\nstudy of their institutions.(38) Suffice it to say, that, even under the\r\nmost horrid despotism of kings, the folkmotes of the village communities\r\nand their customary law remain sovereign in a wide circle of affairs.\r\nThe law of the State allows the king to take any one's life for a simple\r\ncaprice, or even for simply satisfying his gluttony; but the customary\r\nlaw of the people continues to maintain the same network of institutions\r\nfor mutual support which exist among other barbarians or have existed\r\namong our ancestors. And with some better-favoured stems (in Bornu,\r\nUganda, Abyssinia), and especially the Bogos, some of the dispositions\r\nof the customary law are inspired with really graceful and delicate\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nThe village communities of the natives of both Americas have the same\r\ncharacter. The Tupi of Brazil were found living in \"long houses\"\r\noccupied by whole clans which used to cultivate their corn and manioc\r\nfields in common. The Arani, much more advanced in civilization, used to\r\ncultivate their fields in common; so also the Oucagas, who had learned\r\nunder their system of primitive communism and \"long houses\" to build\r\ngood roads and to carry on a variety of domestic industries,(39) not\r\ninferior to those of the early medieval times in Europe. All of them\r\nwere also living under the same customary law of which we have given\r\nspecimens on the preceding pages. At another extremity of the world we\r\nfind the Malayan feudalism, but this feudalism has been powerless to\r\nunroot the negaria, or village community, with its common ownership of\r\nat least part of the land, and the redistribution of land among the\r\nseveral negarias of the tribe.(40) With the Alfurus of Minahasa we find\r\nthe communal rotation of the crops; with the Indian stem of the Wyandots\r\nwe have the periodical redistribution of land within the tribe, and the\r\nclan-culture of the soil; and in all those parts of Sumatra where Moslem\r\ninstitutions have not yet totally destroyed the old organization we find\r\nthe joint family (suka) and the village community (kota) which maintains\r\nits right upon the land, even if part of it has been cleared without its\r\nauthorization.(41) But to say this, is to say that all customs for\r\nmutual protection and prevention of feuds and wars, which have been\r\nbriefly indicated in the preceding pages as characteristic of the\r\nvillage community, exist as well. More than that: the more fully the\r\ncommunal possession of land has been maintained, the better and the\r\ngentler are the habits. De Stuers positively affirms that wherever the\r\ninstitution of the village community has been less encroached upon by\r\nthe conquerors, the inequalities of fortunes are smaller, and the very\r\nprescriptions of the lex talionis are less cruel; while, on the\r\ncontrary, wherever the village community has been totally broken up,\r\n\"the inhabitants suffer the most unbearable oppression from their\r\ndespotic rulers.\"(42) This is quite natural. And when Waitz made the\r\nremark that those stems which have maintained their tribal\r\nconfederations stand on a higher level of development and have a richer\r\nliterature than those stems which have forfeited the old bonds of union,\r\nhe only pointed out what might have been foretold in advance.\r\n\r\nMore illustrations would simply involve me in tedious repetitions--so\r\nstrikingly similar are the barbarian societies under all climates and\r\namidst all races. The same process of evolution has been going on in\r\nmankind with a wonderful similarity. When the clan organization,\r\nassailed as it was from within by the separate family, and from without\r\nby the dismemberment of the migrating clans and the necessity of taking\r\nin strangers of different descent--the village community, based upon a\r\nterritorial conception, came into existence. This new institution, which\r\nhad naturally grown out of the preceding one--the clan--permitted the\r\nbarbarians to pass through a most disturbed period of history without\r\nbeing broken into isolated families which would have succumbed in the\r\nstruggle for life. New forms of culture developed under the new\r\norganization; agriculture attained the stage which it hardly has\r\nsurpassed until now with the great number; the domestic industries\r\nreached a high degree of perfection. The wilderness was conquered, it\r\nwas intersected by roads, dotted with swarms thrown off by the\r\nmother-communities. Markets and fortified centres, as well as places of\r\npublic worship, were erected. The conceptions of a wider union, extended\r\nto whole stems and to several stems of various origin, were slowly\r\nelaborated. The old conceptions of justice which were conceptions of\r\nmere revenge, slowly underwent a deep modification--the idea of amends\r\nfor the wrong done taking the place of revenge. The customary law which\r\nstill makes the law of the daily life for two-thirds or more of mankind,\r\nwas elaborated under that organization, as well as a system of habits\r\nintended to prevent the oppression of the masses by the minorities whose\r\npowers grew in proportion to the growing facilities for private\r\naccumulation of wealth. This was the new form taken by the tendencies of\r\nthe masses for mutual support. And the progress--economical,\r\nintellectual, and moral--which mankind accomplished under this new\r\npopular form of organization, was so great that the States, when they\r\nwere called later on into existence, simply took possession, in the\r\ninterest of the minorities, of all the judicial, economical, and\r\nadministrative functions which the village community already had\r\nexercised in the interest of all.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1. Numberless traces of post-pliocene lakes, now disappeared, are found\r\nover Central, West, and North Asia. Shells of the same species as those\r\nnow found in the Caspian Sea are scattered over the surface of the soil\r\nas far East as half-way to Lake Aral, and are found in recent deposits\r\nas far north as Kazan. Traces of Caspian Gulfs, formerly taken for old\r\nbeds of the Amu, intersect the Turcoman territory. Deduction must surely\r\nbe made for temporary, periodical oscillations. But with all that,\r\ndesiccation is evident, and it progresses at a formerly unexpected\r\nspeed. Even in the relatively wet parts of South-West Siberia, the\r\nsuccession of reliable surveys, recently published by Yadrintseff, shows\r\nthat villages have grown up on what was, eighty years ago, the bottom of\r\none of the lakes of the Tchany group; while the other lakes of the same\r\ngroup, which covered hundreds of square miles some fifty years ago, are\r\nnow mere ponds. In short, the desiccation of North-West Asia goes on at\r\na rate which must be measured by centuries, instead of by the geological\r\nunits of time of which we formerly used to speak.\r\n\r\n2. Whole civilizations had thus disappeared, as is proved now by the\r\nremarkable discoveries in Mongolia on the Orkhon and in the Lukchun\r\ndepression (by Dmitri Clements).\r\n\r\n3. If I follow the opinions of (to name modern specialists only) Nasse,\r\nKovalevsky, and Vinogradov, and not those of Mr. Seebohm (Mr. Denman\r\nRoss can only be named for the sake of completeness), it is not only\r\nbecause of the deep knowledge and concordance of views of these three\r\nwriters, but also on account of their perfect knowledge of the village\r\ncommunity altogether--a knowledge the want of which is much felt in the\r\notherwise remarkable work of Mr. Seebohm. The same remark applies, in a\r\nstill higher degree, to the most elegant writings of Fustel de\r\nCoulanges, whose opinions and passionate interpretations of old texts\r\nare confined to himself.\r\n\r\n4. The literature of the village community is so vast that but a few\r\nworks can be named. Those of Sir Henry Maine, Mr. Seebohm, and Walter's\r\nDas alte Wallis (Bonn, 1859), are well-known popular sources of\r\ninformation about Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. For France, P. Viollet,\r\nPrecis de l'histoire du droit francais. Droit prive, 1886, and several\r\nof his monographs in Bibl. de l'Ecole des Chartes; Babeau, Le Village\r\nsous l'ancien regime (the mir in the eighteenth century), third edition,\r\n1887; Bonnemere, Doniol, etc. For Italy and Scandinavia, the chief works\r\nare named in Laveleye's Primitive Property, German version by K. Bucher.\r\nFor the Finns, Rein's Forelasningar, i. 16; Koskinen, Finnische\r\nGeschichte, 1874, and various monographs. For the Lives and Coures,\r\nProf. Lutchitzky in Severnyi Vestnil, 1891. For the Teutons, besides the\r\nwell-known works of Maurer, Sohm (Altdeutsche Reichs-und\r\nGerichts-Verfassung), also Dahn (Urzeit, Volkerwanderung, Langobardische\r\nStudien), Janssen, Wilh. Arnold, etc. For India, besides H. Maine and\r\nthe works he names, Sir John Phear's Aryan Village. For Russia and South\r\nSlavonians, see Kavelin, Posnikoff, Sokolovsky, Kovalevsky, Efimenko,\r\nIvanisheff, Klaus, etc. (copious bibliographical index up to 1880 in the\r\nSbornik svedeniy ob obschinye of the Russ. Geog. Soc.). For general\r\nconclusions, besides Laveleye's Propriete, Morgan's Ancient Society,\r\nLippert's Kulturgeschichte, Post, Dargun, etc., also the lectures of M.\r\nKovalevsky (Tableau des origines et de l'evolution de la famille et de\r\nla propriete, Stockholm, 1890). Many special monographs ought to be\r\nmentioned; their titles may be found in the excellent lists given by P.\r\nViollet in Droit prive and Droit public. For other races, see subsequent\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\n5. Several authorities are inclined to consider the joint household as\r\nan intermediate stage between the clan and the village community; and\r\nthere is no doubt that in very many cases village communities have grown\r\nup out of undivided families. Nevertheless, I consider the joint\r\nhousehold as a fact of a different order. We find it within the gentes;\r\non the other hand, we cannot affirm that joint families have existed at\r\nany period without belonging either to a gens or to a village community,\r\nor to a Gau. I conceive the early village communities as slowly\r\noriginating directly from the gentes, and consisting, according to\r\nracial and local circumstances, either of several joint families, or of\r\nboth joint and simple families, or (especially in the case of new\r\nsettlements) of simple families only. If this view be correct, we should\r\nnot have the right of establishing the series: gens, compound family,\r\nvillage community--the second member of the series having not the same\r\nethnological value as the two others.

Konigswarter has shown that the fred originated from an offering\r\nwhich had to be made to appease the ancestors. Later on, it was paid to\r\nthe community, for the breach of peace; and still later to the judge, or\r\nking, or lord, when they had appropriated to themselves the rights of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\n22.

I am told by a Caucasian friend that in Georgia, when the\r\npoor man wants an \"aid,\" he borrows from the rich man a sheep or two to\r\nprepare the meal, and the community bring, in addition to their work, so\r\nmany provisions that he may repay the debt.

Serfdom in the villages.\r\nRevolt of fortified towns: their liberation; their charts. The guild.\r\nDouble origin of the free medieval city. Self-jurisdiction,\r\nself-administration. Honourable position of labour. Trade by the guild\r\nand by the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nSociability and need of mutual aid and support are such inherent parts\r\nof human nature that at no time of history can we discover men living in\r\nsmall isolated families, fighting each other for the means of\r\nsubsistence. On the contrary, modern research, as we saw it in the two\r\npreceding chapters, proves that since the very beginning of their\r\nprehistoric life men used to agglomerate into gentes, clans, or tribes,\r\nmaintained by an idea of common descent and by worship of common\r\nancestors. For thousands and thousands of years this organization has\r\nkept men together, even though there was no authority whatever to impose\r\nit. It has deeply impressed all subsequent development of mankind; and\r\nwhen the bonds of common descent had been loosened by migrations on a\r\ngrand scale, while the development of the separated family within the\r\nclan itself had destroyed the old unity of the clan, a new form of\r\nunion, territorial in its principle--the village community--was called\r\ninto existence by the social genius of man. This institution, again,\r\nkept men together for a number of centuries, permitting them to further\r\ndevelop their social institutions and to pass through some of the\r\ndarkest periods of history, without being dissolved into loose\r\naggregations of families and individuals, to make a further step in\r\ntheir evolution, and to work out a number of secondary social\r\ninstitutions, several of which have survived down to the present time.\r\nWe have now to follow the further developments of the same ever-living\r\ntendency for mutual aid. Taking the village communities of the so-called\r\nbarbarians at a time when they were making a new start of civilization\r\nafter the fall of the Roman Empire, we have to study the new aspects\r\ntaken by the sociable wants of the masses in the middle ages, and\r\nespecially in the medieval guilds and the medieval city.\r\n\r\nFar from being the fighting animals they have often been compared to,\r\nthe barbarians of the first centuries of our era (like so many\r\nMongolians, Africans, Arabs, and so on, who still continue in the same\r\nbarbarian stage) invariably preferred peace to war. With the exception\r\nof a few tribes which had been driven during the great migrations into\r\nunproductive deserts or highlands, and were thus compelled periodically\r\nto prey upon their better-favoured neighbours--apart from these, the\r\ngreat bulk of the Teutons, the Saxons, the Celts, the Slavonians, and so\r\non, very soon after they had settled in their newly-conquered abodes,\r\nreverted to the spade or to their herds. The earliest barbarian codes\r\nalready represent to us societies composed of peaceful agricultural\r\ncommunities, not hordes of men at war with each other. These barbarians\r\ncovered the country with villages and farmhouses;(1) they cleared the\r\nforests, bridged the torrents, and colonized the formerly quite\r\nuninhabited wilderness; and they left the uncertain warlike pursuits to\r\nbrotherhoods, scholae, or \"trusts\" of unruly men, gathered round\r\ntemporary chieftains, who wandered about, offering their adventurous\r\nspirit, their arms, and their knowledge of warfare for the protection of\r\npopulations, only too anxious to be left in peace. The warrior bands\r\ncame and went, prosecuting their family feuds; but the great mass\r\ncontinued to till the soil, taking but little notice of their would-be\r\nrulers, so long as they did not interfere with the independence of their\r\nvillage communities.(2) The new occupiers of Europe evolved the systems\r\nof land tenure and soil culture which are still in force with hundreds\r\nof millions of men; they worked out their systems of compensation for\r\nwrongs, instead of the old tribal blood-revenge; they learned the first\r\nrudiments of industry; and while they fortified their villages with\r\npalisaded walls, or erected towers and earthen forts whereto to repair\r\nin case of a new invasion, they soon abandoned the task of defending\r\nthese towers and forts to those who made of war a speciality.\r\n\r\nThe very peacefulness of the barbarians, certainly not their supposed\r\nwarlike instincts, thus became the source of their subsequent subjection\r\nto the military chieftains. It is evident that the very mode of life of\r\nthe armed brotherhoods offered them more facilities for enrichment than\r\nthe tillers of the soil could find in their agricultural communities.\r\nEven now we see that armed men occasionally come together to shoot down\r\nMatabeles and to rob them of their droves of cattle, though the\r\nMatabeles only want peace and are ready to buy it at a high price. The\r\nscholae of old certainly were not more scrupulous than the scholae of\r\nour own time. Droves of cattle, iron (which was extremely costly at that\r\ntime(3)), and slaves were appropriated in this way; and although most\r\nacquisitions were wasted on the spot in those glorious feasts of which\r\nepic poetry has so much to say--still some part of the robbed riches was\r\nused for further enrichment. There was plenty of waste land, and no lack\r\nof men ready to till it, if only they could obtain the necessary cattle\r\nand implements. Whole villages, ruined by murrains, pests, fires, or\r\nraids of new immigrants, were often abandoned by their inhabitants, who\r\nwent anywhere in search of new abodes. They still do so in Russia in\r\nsimilar circumstances. And if one of the hirdmen of the armed\r\nbrotherhoods offered the peasants some cattle for a fresh start, some\r\niron to make a plough, if not the plough itself, his protection from\r\nfurther raids, and a number of years free from all obligations, before\r\nthey should begin to repay the contracted debt, they settled upon the\r\nland. And when, after a hard fight with bad crops, inundations and\r\npestilences, those pioneers began to repay their debts, they fell into\r\nservile obligations towards the protector of the territory. Wealth\r\nundoubtedly did accumulate in this way, and power always follows\r\nwealth.(4) And yet, the more we penetrate into the life of those times,\r\nthe sixth and seventh centuries of our era, the more we see that another\r\nelement, besides wealth and military force, was required to constitute\r\nthe authority of the few. It was an element of law and tight, a desire\r\nof the masses to maintain peace, and to establish what they considered\r\nto be justice, which gave to the chieftains of the scholae--kings,\r\ndukes, knyazes, and the like--the force they acquired two or three\r\nhundred years later. That same idea of justice, conceived as an adequate\r\nrevenge for the wrong done, which had grown in the tribal stage, now\r\npassed as a red thread through the history of subsequent institutions,\r\nand, much more even than military or economic causes, it became the\r\nbasis upon which the authority of the kings and the feudal lords was\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nIn fact, one of the chief preoccupations of the barbarian village\r\ncommunity always was, as it still is with our barbarian contemporaries,\r\nto put a speedy end to the feuds which arose from the then current\r\nconception of justice. When a quarrel took place, the community at once\r\ninterfered, and after the folkmote had heard the case, it settled the\r\namount of composition (wergeld) to be paid to the wronged person, or to\r\nhis family, as well as the fred, or fine for breach of peace, which had\r\nto be paid to the community. Interior quarrels were easily appeased in\r\nthis way. But when feuds broke out between two different tribes, or two\r\nconfederations of tribes, notwithstanding all measures taken to prevent\r\nthem,(5) the difficulty was to find an arbiter or sentence-finder whose\r\ndecision should be accepted by both parties alike, both for his\r\nimpartiality and for his knowledge of the oldest law. The difficulty was\r\nthe greater as the customary laws of different tribes and confederations\r\nwere at variance as to the compensation due in different cases. It\r\ntherefore became habitual to take the sentence-finder from among such\r\nfamilies, or such tribes, as were reputed for keeping the law of old in\r\nits purity; of being versed in the songs, triads, sagas, etc., by means\r\nof which law was perpetuated in memory; and to retain law in this way\r\nbecame a sort of art, a \"mystery,\" carefully transmitted in certain\r\nfamilies from generation to generation. Thus in Iceland, and in other\r\nScandinavian lands, at every A11thing, or national folkmote, a\r\nlövsögmathr used to recite the whole law from memory for the\r\nenlightening of the assembly; and in Ireland there was, as is known, a\r\nspecial class of men reputed for the knowledge of the old traditions,\r\nand therefore enjoying a great authority as judges.(6) Again, when we\r\nare told by the Russian annals that some stems of North-West Russia,\r\nmoved by the growing disorder which resulted from \"clans rising against\r\nclans,\" appealed to Norman varingiar to be their judges and commanders\r\nof warrior scholae; and when we see the knyazes, or dukes, elected for\r\nthe next two hundred years always from the same Norman family, we cannot\r\nbut recognize that the Slavonians trusted to the Normans for a better\r\nknowledge of the law which would be equally recognized as good by\r\ndifferent Slavonian kins. In this case the possession of runes, used for\r\nthe transmission of old customs, was a decided advantage in favour of\r\nthe Normans; but in other cases there are faint indications that the\r\n\"eldest\" branch of the stem, the supposed motherbranch, was appealed to\r\nto supply the judges, and its decisions were relied upon as just;(7)\r\nwhile at a later epoch we see a distinct tendency towards taking the\r\nsentence-finders from the Christian clergy, which, at that time, kept\r\nstill to the fundamental, now forgotten, principle of Christianity, that\r\nretaliation is no act of justice. At that time the Christian clergy\r\nopened the churches as places of asylum for those who fled from blood\r\nrevenge, and they willingly acted as arbiters in criminal cases, always\r\nopposing the old tribal principle of life for life and wound for wound.\r\nIn short, the deeper we penetrate into the history of early\r\ninstitutions, the less we find grounds for the military theory of origin\r\nof authority. Even that power which later on became such a source of\r\noppression seems, on the contrary, to have found its origin in the\r\npeaceful inclinations of the masses.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases the fred, which often amounted to half the\r\ncompensation, went to the folkmote, and from times immemorial it used to\r\nbe applied to works of common utility and defence. It has still the same\r\ndestination (the erection of towers) among the Kabyles and certain\r\nMongolian stems; and we have direct evidence that even several centuries\r\nlater the judicial fines, in Pskov and several French and German cities,\r\ncontinued to be used for the repair of the city walls.(8) It was thus\r\nquite natural that the fines should be handed over to the\r\nsentence-finder, who was bound, in return, both to maintain the schola\r\nof armed men to whom the defence of the territory was trusted, and to\r\nexecute the sentences. This became a universal custom in the eighth and\r\nninth centuries, even when the sentence-finder was an elected bishop.\r\nThe germ of a combination of what we should now call the judicial power\r\nand the executive thus made its appearance. But to these two functions\r\nthe attributions of the duke or king were strictly limited. He was no\r\nruler of the people--the supreme power still belonging to the\r\nfolkmote--not even a commander of the popular militia; when the folk\r\ntook to arms, it marched under a separate, also elected, commander, who\r\nwas not a subordinate, but an equal to the king.(9) The king was a lord\r\non his personal domain only. In fact, in barbarian language, the word\r\nkonung, koning, or cyning synonymous with the Latin rex, had no other\r\nmeaning than that of a temporary leader or chieftain of a band of men.\r\nThe commander of a flotilla of boats, or even of a single pirate boat,\r\nwas also a konung, and till the present day the commander of fishing in\r\nNorway is named Not-kong--\"the king of the nets.\"(10) The veneration\r\nattached later on to the personality of a king did not yet exist, and\r\nwhile treason to the kin was punished by death, the slaying of a king\r\ncould be recouped by the payment of compensation: a king simply was\r\nvalued so much more than a freeman.(11) And when King Knu (or Canute)\r\nhad killed one man of his own schola, the saga represents him convoking\r\nhis comrades to a thing where he stood on his knees imploring pardon. He\r\nwas pardoned, but not till he had agreed to pay nine times the regular\r\ncomposition, of which one-third went to himself for the loss of one of\r\nhis men, one-third to the relatives of the slain man, and one-third (the\r\nfred) to the schola.(12) In reality, a complete change had to be\r\naccomplished in the current conceptions, under the double influence of\r\nthe Church and the students of Roman law, before an idea of sanctity\r\nbegan to be attached to the personality of the king.\r\n\r\nHowever, it lies beyond the scope of these essays to follow the gradual\r\ndevelopment of authority out of the elements just indicated. Historians,\r\nsuch as Mr. and Mrs. Green for this country, Augustin Thierry, Michelet,\r\nand Luchaire for France, Kaufmann, Janssen, W. Arnold, and even Nitzsch,\r\nfor Germany, Leo and Botta for Italy, Byelaeff, Kostomaroff, and their\r\nfollowers for Russia, and many others, have fully told that tale. They\r\nhave shown how populations, once free, and simply agreeing \"to feed\" a\r\ncertain portion of their military defenders, gradually became the serfs\r\nof these protectors; how \"commendation\" to the Church, or to a lord,\r\nbecame a hard necessity for the freeman; how each lord's and bishop's\r\ncastle became a robber's nest--how feudalism was imposed, in a word--and\r\nhow the crusades, by freeing the serfs who wore the cross, gave the\r\nfirst impulse to popular emancipation. All this need not be retold in\r\nthis place, our chief aim being to follow the constructive genius of the\r\nmasses in their mutual-aid institutions.\r\n\r\nAt a time when the last vestiges of barbarian freedom seemed to\r\ndisappear, and Europe, fallen under the dominion of thousands of petty\r\nrulers, was marching towards the constitution of such theocracies and\r\ndespotic States as had followed the barbarian stage during the previous\r\nstarts of civilization, or of barbarian monarchies, such as we see now\r\nin Africa, life in Europe took another direction. It went on on lines\r\nsimilar to those it had once taken in the cities of antique Greece. With\r\na unanimity which seems almost incomprehensible, and for a long time was\r\nnot understood by historians, the urban agglomerations, down to the\r\nsmallest burgs, began to shake off the yoke of their worldly and\r\nclerical lords. The fortified village rose against the lord's castle,\r\ndefied it first, attacked it next, and finally destroyed it. The\r\nmovement spread from spot to spot, involving every town on the surface\r\nof Europe, and in less than a hundred years free cities had been called\r\ninto existence on the coasts of the Mediterranean, the North Sea, the\r\nBaltic, the Atlantic Ocean, down to the fjords of Scandinavia; at the\r\nfeet of the Apennines, the Alps, the Black Forest, the Grampians, and\r\nthe Carpathians; in the plains of Russia, Hungary, France and Spain.\r\nEverywhere the same revolt took place, with the same features, passing\r\nthrough the same phases, leading to the same results. Wherever men had\r\nfound, or expected to find, some protection behind their town walls,\r\nthey instituted their \"co-jurations,\" their \"fraternities,\" their\r\n\"friendships,\" united in one common idea, and boldly marching towards a\r\nnew life of mutual support and liberty. And they succeeded so well that\r\nin three or four hundred years they had changed the very face of Europe.\r\nThey had covered the country with beautiful sumptuous buildings,\r\nexpressing the genius of free unions of free men, unrivalled since for\r\ntheir beauty and expressiveness; and they bequeathed to the following\r\ngenerations all the arts, all the industries, of which our present\r\ncivilization, with all its achievements and promises for the future, is\r\nonly a further development. And when we now look to the forces which\r\nhave produced these grand results, we find them--not in the genius of\r\nindividual heroes, not in the mighty organization of huge States or the\r\npolitical capacities of their rulers, but in the very same current of\r\nmutual aid and support which we saw at work in the village community,\r\nand which was vivified and reinforced in the Middle Ages by a new form\r\nof unions, inspired by the very same spirit but shaped on a new\r\nmodel--the guilds.\r\n\r\nIt is well known by this time that feudalism did not imply a dissolution\r\nof the village community. Although the lord had succeeded in imposing\r\nservile labour upon the peasants, and had appropriated for himself such\r\nrights as were formerly vested in the village community alone (taxes,\r\nmortmain, duties on inheritances and marriages), the peasants had,\r\nnevertheless, maintained the two fundamental rights of their\r\ncommunities: the common possession of the land, and self-jurisdiction.\r\nIn olden times, when a king sent his vogt to a village, the peasants\r\nreceived him with flowers in one hand and arms in the other, and asked\r\nhim--which law he intended to apply: the one he found in the village, or\r\nthe one he brought with him? And, in the first case, they handed him the\r\nflowers and accepted him; while in the second case they fought him.(13)\r\nNow, they accepted the king's or the lord's official whom they could not\r\nrefuse; but they maintained the folkmote's jurisdiction, and themselves\r\nnominated six, seven, or twelve judges, who acted with the lord's judge,\r\nin the presence of the folkmote, as arbiters and sentence-finders. In\r\nmost cases the official had nothing left to him but to confirm the\r\nsentence and to levy the customary fred. This precious right of\r\nself-jurisdiction, which, at that time, meant self-administration and\r\nself-legislation, had been maintained through all the struggles; and\r\neven the lawyers by whom Karl the Great was surrounded could not abolish\r\nit; they were bound to confirm it. At the same time, in all matters\r\nconcerning the community's domain, the folkmote retained its supremacy\r\nand (as shown by Maurer) often claimed submission from the lord himself\r\nin land tenure matters. No growth of feudalism could break this\r\nresistance; the village community kept its ground; and when, in the\r\nninth and tenth centuries, the invasions of the Normans, the Arabs, and\r\nthe Ugrians had demonstrated that military scholae were of little value\r\nfor protecting the land, a general movement began all over Europe for\r\nfortifying the villages with stone walls and citadels. Thousands of\r\nfortified centres were then built by the energies of the village\r\ncommunities; and, once they had built their walls, once a common\r\ninterest had been created in this new sanctuary--the town walls--they\r\nsoon understood that they could henceforward resist the encroachments of\r\nthe inner enemies, the lords, as well as the invasions of foreigners. A\r\nnew life of freedom began to develop within the fortified enclosures.\r\nThe medieval city was born.(14)\r\n\r\nNo period of history could better illustrate the constructive powers of\r\nthe popular masses than the tenth and eleventh centuries, when the\r\nfortified villages and market-places, representing so many \"oases amidst\r\nthe feudal forest,\" began to free themselves from their lord's yoke, and\r\nslowly elaborated the future city organization; but, unhappily, this is\r\na period about which historical information is especially scarce: we\r\nknow the results, but little has reached us about the means by which\r\nthey were achieved. Under the protection of their walls the cities'\r\nfolkmotes--either quite independent, or led by the chief noble or\r\nmerchant families--conquered and maintained the right of electing the\r\nmilitary defensor and supreme judge of the town, or at least of choosing\r\nbetween those who pretended to occupy this position. In Italy the young\r\ncommunes were continually sending away their defensors or domini,\r\nfighting those who refused to go. The same went on in the East. In\r\nBohemia, rich and poor alike (Bohemicae gentis magni et parvi, nobiles\r\net ignobiles) took part in the election;(15) while, the vyeches\r\n(folkmotes) of the Russian cities regularly elected their dukes--always\r\nfrom the same Rurik family--covenanted with them, and sent the knyaz\r\naway if he had provoked discontent.(16) At the same time in most cities\r\nof Western and Southern Europe, the tendency was to take for defensor a\r\nbishop whom the city had elected itself; and so many bishops took the\r\nlead in protecting the \"immunities\" of the towns and in defending their\r\nliberties, that numbers of them were considered, after their death, as\r\nsaints and special patrons of different cities. St. Uthelred of\r\nWinchester, St. Ulrik of Augsburg, St. Wolfgang of Ratisbon, St.\r\nHeribert of Cologne, St. Adalbert of Prague, and so on, as well as many\r\nabbots and monks, became so many cities' saints for having acted in\r\ndefence of popular rights.(17) And under the new defensors, whether laic\r\nor clerical, the citizens conquered full self-jurisdiction and\r\nself-administration for their folkmotes.(18)\r\n\r\nThe whole process of liberation progressed by a series of imperceptible\r\nacts of devotion to the common cause, accomplished by men who came out\r\nof the masses--by unknown heroes whose very names have not been\r\npreserved by history. The wonderful movement of the God's peace (treuga\r\nDei) by which the popular masses endeavoured to put a limit to the\r\nendless family feuds of the noble families, was born in the young towns,\r\nthe bishops and the citizens trying to extend to the nobles the peace\r\nthey had established within their town walls.(19) Already at that\r\nperiod, the commercial cities of Italy, and especially Amalfi (which had\r\nits elected consuls since 844, and frequently changed its doges in the\r\ntenth century)(20) worked out the customary maritime and commercial law\r\nwhich later on became a model for all Europe; Ravenna elaborated its\r\ncraft organization, and Milan, which had made its first revolution in\r\n980, became a great centre of commerce, its trades enjoying a full\r\nindependence since the eleventh century.(21) So also Brugge and Ghent;\r\nso also several cities of France in which the Mahl or forum had become a\r\nquite independent institution.(22) And already during that period began\r\nthe work of artistic decoration of the towns by works of architecture,\r\nwhich we still admire and which loudly testify of the intellectual\r\nmovement of the times. \"The basilicae were then renewed in almost all\r\nthe universe,\" Raoul Glaber wrote in his chronicle, and some of the\r\nfinest monuments of medieval architecture date from that period: the\r\nwonderful old church of Bremen was built in the ninth century, Saint\r\nMarc of Venice was finished in 1071, and the beautiful dome of Pisa in\r\n1063. In fact, the intellectual movement which has been described as the\r\nTwelfth Century Renaissance(23) and the Twelfth Century Rationalism--the\r\nprecursor of the Reform(24) date from that period, when most cities were\r\nstill simple agglomerations of small village communities enclosed by\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nHowever, another element, besides the village-community principle, was\r\nrequired to give to these growing centres of liberty and enlightenment\r\nthe unity of thought and action, and the powers of initiative, which\r\nmade their force in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. With the\r\ngrowing diversity of occupations, crafts and arts, and with the growing\r\ncommerce in distant lands, some new form of union was required, and this\r\nnecessary new element was supplied by the guilds. Volumes and volumes\r\nhave been written about these unions which, under the name of guilds,\r\nbrotherhoods, friendships and druzhestva, minne, artels in Russia,\r\nesnaifs in Servia and Turkey, amkari in Georgia, and so on, took such a\r\nformidable development in medieval times and played such an important\r\npart in the emancipation of the cities. But it took historians more than\r\nsixty years before the universality of this institution and its true\r\ncharacters were understood. Only now, when hundreds of guild statutes\r\nhave been published and studied, and their relationship to the Roman\r\ncollegiae, and the earlier unions in Greece and in India,(25) is known,\r\ncan we maintain with full confidence that these brotherhoods were but a\r\nfurther development of the same principles which we saw at work in the\r\ngens and the village community.\r\n\r\nNothing illustrates better these medieval brother hoods than those\r\ntemporary guilds which were formed on board ships. When a ship of the\r\nHansa had accomplished her first half-day passage after having left the\r\nport, the captain (Schiffer) gathered all crew and passengers on the\r\ndeck, and held the following language, as reported by a contemporary:--\r\n\r\n\"'As we are now at the mercy of God and the waves,' he said, 'each one\r\nmust be equal to each other. And as we are surrounded by storms, high\r\nwaves, pirates and other dangers, we must keep a strict order that we\r\nmay bring our voyage to a good end. That is why we shall pronounce the\r\nprayer for a good wind and good success, and, according to marine law,\r\nwe shall name the occupiers of the judges' seats (Schoffenstellen).'\r\nThereupon the crew elected a Vogt and four scabini, to act as their\r\njudges. At the end of the voyage the Vogt and the scabini abdicated\r\ntheir functions and addressed the crew as follows:--'What has happened on board ship, we\r\nmust pardon to each other and consider as dead (todt\r\nund ab sein lassen). What we have judged right, was for the sake of\r\njustice. This is why we beg you all, in the name of honest justice, to\r\nforget all the animosity one may nourish against another, and to swear\r\non bread and salt that he will not think of it in a bad spirit. If any\r\none, however, considers himself wronged, he must appeal to the land Vogt\r\nand ask justice from him before sunset.' On landing, the Stock with the\r\nfredfines was handed over to the Vogt of the sea-port for distribution\r\namong the poor.\"(26)\r\n\r\nThis simple narrative, perhaps better than anything else, depicts the\r\nspirit of the medieval guilds. Like organizations came into existence\r\nwherever a group of men--fishermen, hunters, travelling merchants,\r\nbuilders, or settled craftsmen--came together for a common pursuit.\r\nThus, there was on board ship the naval authority of the captain; but,\r\nfor the very success of the common enterprise, all men on board, rich\r\nand poor, masters and crew, captain and sailors, agreed to be equals in\r\ntheir mutual relations, to be simply men, bound to aid each other and to\r\nsettle their possible disputes before judges elected by all of them. So\r\nalso when a number of craftsmen--masons, carpenters, stone-cutters,\r\netc.--came together for building, say, a cathedral, they all belonged to\r\na city which had its political organization, and each of them belonged\r\nmoreover to his own craft; but they were united besides by their common\r\nenterprise, which they knew better than any one else, and they joined\r\ninto a body united by closer, although temporary, bonds; they founded\r\nthe guild for the building of the cathedral.(27) We may see the same\r\ntill now in the Kabylian. cof:(28) the Kabyles have their village\r\ncommunity; but this union is not sufficient for all political,\r\ncommercial, and personal needs of union, and the closer brotherhood of\r\nthe cof is constituted.\r\n\r\nAs to the social characters of the medieval guild, any guild-statute may\r\nillustrate them. Taking, for instance, the skraa of some early Danish\r\nguild, we read in it, first, a statement of the general brotherly\r\nfeelings which must reign in the guild; next come the regulations\r\nrelative to self-jurisdiction in cases of quarrels arising between two\r\nbrothers, or a brother and a stranger; and then, the social duties of\r\nthe brethren are enumerated. If a brother's house is burned, or he has\r\nlost his ship, or has suffered on a pilgrim's voyage, all the brethren\r\nmust come to his aid. If a brother falls dangerously ill, two brethren\r\nmust keep watch by his bed till he is out of danger, and if he dies, the\r\nbrethren must bury him--a great affair in those times of\r\npestilences--and follow him to the church and the grave. After his death\r\nthey must provide for his children, if necessary; very often the widow\r\nbecomes a sister to the guild.(29)\r\n\r\nThese two leading features appeared in every brotherhood formed for any\r\npossible purpose. In each case the members treated each other as, and\r\nnamed each other, brother and sister;(30) all were equals before the\r\nguild. They owned some \"chattel\" (cattle, land, buildings, places of\r\nworship, or \"stock\") in common. All brothers took the oath of abandoning\r\nall feuds of old; and, without imposing upon each other the obligation\r\nof never quarrelling again, they agreed that no quarrel should\r\ndegenerate into a feud, or into a law-suit before another court than the\r\ntribunal of the brothers themselves. And if a brother was involved in a\r\nquarrel with a stranger to the guild, they agreed to support him for bad\r\nand for good; that is, whether he was unjustly accused of aggression, or\r\nreally was the aggressor, they had to support him, and to bring things\r\nto a peaceful end. So long as his was not a secret aggression--in which\r\ncase he would have been treated as an outlaw--the brotherhood stood by\r\nhim.(31) If the relatives of the wronged man wanted to revenge the\r\noffence at once by a new aggression, the brother-hood supplied him with\r\na horse to run away, or with a boat, a pair of oars, a knife and a steel\r\nfor striking light; if he remained in town, twelve brothers accompanied\r\nhim to protect him; and in the meantime they arranged the composition.\r\nThey went to court to support by oath the truthfulness of his\r\nstatements, and if he was found guilty they did not let him go to full\r\nruin and become a slave through not paying the due compensation: they\r\nall paid it, just as the gens did in olden times. Only when a brother\r\nhad broken the faith towards his guild-brethren, or other people, he was\r\nexcluded from the brotherhood \"with a Nothing's name\" (tha scal han\r\nmaeles af brodrescap met nidings nafn).(32)\r\n\r\nSuch were the leading ideas of those brotherhoods which gradually\r\ncovered the whole of medieval life. In fact, we know of guilds among all\r\npossible professions: guilds of serfs,(33) guilds of freemen, and guilds\r\nof both serfs and freemen; guilds called into life for the special\r\npurpose of hunting, fishing, or a trading expedition, and dissolved when\r\nthe special purpose had been achieved; and guilds lasting for centuries\r\nin a given craft or trade. And, in proportion as life took an always\r\ngreater variety of pursuits, the variety in the guilds grew in\r\nproportion. So we see not only merchants, craftsmen, hunters, and\r\npeasants united in guilds; we also see guilds of priests, painters,\r\nteachers of primary schools and universities, guilds for performing the\r\npassion play, for building a church, for developing the \"mystery\" of a\r\ngiven school of art or craft, or for a special recreation--even guilds\r\namong beggars, executioners, and lost women, all organized on the same\r\ndouble principle of self-jurisdiction and mutual support.(34) For Russia\r\nwe have positive evidence showing that the very \"making of Russia\" was\r\nas much the work of its hunters', fishermen's, and traders' artels as of\r\nthe budding village communities, and up to the present day the country\r\nis covered with artels.(35)\r\n\r\nThese few remarks show how incorrect was the view taken by some early\r\nexplorers of the guilds when they wanted to see the essence of the\r\ninstitution in its yearly festival. In reality, the day of the common\r\nmeal was always the day, or the morrow of the day, of election of\r\naldermen, of discussion of alterations in the statutes, and very often\r\nthe day of judgment of quarrels that had risen among the brethren,(36)\r\nor of renewed allegiance to the guild. The common meal, like the\r\nfestival at the old tribal folkmote--the mahl or malum--or the Buryate\r\naba, or the parish feast and the harvest supper, was simply an\r\naffirmation of brotherhood. It symbolized the times when everything was\r\nkept in common by the clan. This day, at least, all belonged to all; all\r\nsate at the same table and partook of the same meal. Even at a much\r\nlater time the inmate of the almshouse of a London guild sat this day by\r\nthe side of the rich alderman. As to the distinction which several\r\nexplorers have tried to establish between the old Saxon \"frith guild\"\r\nand the so-called \"social\" or \"religious\" guilds--all were frith guilds\r\nin the sense above mentioned,(37) and all were religious in the sense in\r\nwhich a village community or a city placed under the protection of a\r\nspecial saint is social and religious. If the institution of the guild\r\nhas taken such an immense extension in Asia, Africa, and Europe, if it\r\nhas lived thousands of years, reappearing again and again when similar\r\nconditions called it into existence, it is because it was much more than\r\nan eating association, or an association for going to church on a\r\ncertain day, or a burial club. It answered to a deeply inrooted want of\r\nhuman nature; and it embodied all the attributes which the State\r\nappropriated later on for its bureaucracy and police, and much more than\r\nthat. It was an association for mutual support in all circumstances and\r\nin all accidents of life, \"by deed and advise,\" and it was an\r\norganization for maintaining justice--with this difference from the\r\nState, that on all these occasions a humane, a brotherly element was\r\nintroduced instead of the formal element which is the essential\r\ncharacteristic of State interference. Even when appearing before the\r\nguild tribunal, the guild-brother answered before men who knew him well\r\nand had stood by him before in their daily work, at the common meal, in\r\nthe performance of their brotherly duties: men who were his equals and\r\nbrethren indeed, not theorists of law nor defenders of some one else's\r\ninterests.(38)\r\n\r\nIt is evident that an institution so well suited to serve the need of\r\nunion, without depriving the individual of his initiative, could but\r\nspread, grow, and fortify. The difficulty was only to find such form as\r\nwould permit to federate the unions of the guilds without interfering\r\nwith the unions of the village communities, and to federate all these\r\ninto one harmonious whole. And when this form of combination had been\r\nfound, and a series of favourable circumstances permitted the cities to\r\naffirm their independence, they did so with a unity of thought which can\r\nbut excite our admiration, even in our century of railways, telegraphs,\r\nand printing. Hundreds of charters in which the cities inscribed their\r\nliberation have reached us, and through all of them--notwithstanding the\r\ninfinite variety of details, which depended upon the more or less\r\ngreater fulness of emancipation--the same leading ideas run. The city\r\norganized itself as a federation of both small village communities and\r\nguilds.\r\n\r\n\"All those who belong to the friendship of the town\"--so runs a charter\r\ngiven in 1188 to the burghesses of Aire by Philip, Count of\r\nFlanders--\"have promised and confirmed by faith and oath that they will\r\naid each other as brethren, in whatever is useful and honest. That if\r\none commits against another an offence in words or in deeds, the one who\r\nhas suffered there from will not take revenge, either himself or his\r\npeople ... he will lodge a complaint and the offender will make good for\r\nhis offence, according to what will be pronounced by twelve elected\r\njudges acting as arbiters, And if the offender or the offended, after\r\nhaving been warned thrice, does not submit to the decision of the\r\narbiters, he will be excluded from the friendship as a wicked man and a\r\nperjuror.(39)\r\n\r\n\"Each one of the men of the commune will be faithful to his con-juror,\r\nand will give him aid and advice, according to what justice will dictate\r\nhim\"--the Amiens and Abbeville charters say. \"All will aid each other,\r\naccording to their powers, within the boundaries of the Commune, and\r\nwill not suffer that any one takes anything from any one of them, or\r\nmakes one pay contributions\"--do we read in the charters of Soissons,\r\nCompiegne, Senlis, and many others of the same type.(40) And so on with\r\ncountless variations on the same theme.\r\n\r\n\"The Commune,\" Guilbert de Nogent wrote, \"is an oath of mutual aid\r\n(mutui adjutorii conjuratio) ... A new and detestable word. Through it\r\nthe serfs (capite sensi) are freed from all serfdom; through it, they\r\ncan only be condemned to a legally determined fine for breaches of the\r\nlaw; through it, they cease to be liable to payments which the serfs\r\nalways used to pay.\"(41)\r\n\r\nThe same wave of emancipation ran, in the twelfth century, through all\r\nparts of the continent, involving both rich cities and the poorest\r\ntowns. And if we may say that, as a rule, the Italian cities were the\r\nfirst to free themselves, we can assign no centre from which the\r\nmovement would have spread. Very often a small burg in central Europe\r\ntook the lead for its region, and big agglomerations accepted the little\r\ntown's charter as a model for their own. Thus, the charter of a small\r\ntown, Lorris, was adopted by eighty-three towns in south-west France,\r\nand that of Beaumont became the model for over five hundred towns and\r\ncities in Belgium and France. Special deputies were dispatched by the\r\ncities to their neighbours to obtain a copy from their charter, and the\r\nconstitution was framed upon that model. However, they did not simply\r\ncopy each other: they framed their own charters in accordance with the\r\nconcessions they had obtained from their lords; and the result was that,\r\nas remarked by an historian, the charters of the medieval communes offer\r\nthe same variety as the Gothic architecture of their churches and\r\ncathedrals. The same leading ideas in all of them--the cathedral\r\nsymbolizing the union of parish and guild in the, city--and the same\r\ninfinitely rich variety of detail.\r\n\r\nSelf-jurisdiction was the essential point, and self-jurisdiction meant\r\nself-administration. But the commune was not simply an \"autonomous\" part\r\nof the State--such ambiguous words had not yet been invented by that\r\ntime--it was a State in itself. It had the right of war and peace, of\r\nfederation and alliance with its neighbours. It was sovereign in its own\r\naffairs, and mixed with no others. The supreme political power could be\r\nvested entirely in a democratic forum, as was the case in Pskov, whose\r\nvyeche sent and received ambassadors, concluded treaties, accepted and\r\nsent away princes, or went on without them for dozens of years; or it\r\nwas vested in, or usurped by, an aristocracy of merchants or even\r\nnobles, as was the case in hundreds of Italian and middle European\r\ncities. The principle, nevertheless, remained the same: the city was a\r\nState and--what was perhaps still more remarkable--when the power in the\r\ncity was usurped by an aristocracy of merchants or even nobles, the\r\ninner life of the city and the democratism of its daily life did not\r\ndisappear: they depended but little upon what may be called the\r\npolitical form of the State.\r\n\r\nThe secret of this seeming anomaly lies in the fact that a medieval city\r\nwas not a centralized State. During the first centuries of its\r\nexistence, the city hardly could be named a State as regards its\r\ninterior organization, because the middle ages knew no more of the\r\npresent centralization of functions than of the present territorial\r\ncentralization. Each group had its share of sovereignty. The city was\r\nusually divided into four quarters, or into five to seven sections\r\nradiating from a centre, each quarter or section roughly corresponding\r\nto a certain trade or profession which prevailed in it, but nevertheless\r\ncontaining inhabitants of different social positions and\r\noccupations--nobles, merchants, artisans, or even half-serfs; and each\r\nsection or quarter constituted a quite independent agglomeration. In\r\nVenice, each island was an independent political community. It had its\r\nown organized trades, its own commerce in salt, its own jurisdiction and\r\nadministration, its own forum; and the nomination of a doge by the city\r\nchanged nothing in the inner independence of the units.(42) In Cologne,\r\nwe see the inhabitants divided into Geburschaften and Heimschaften\r\n(viciniae), i.e. neighbour guilds, which dated from the Franconian\r\nperiod. Each of them had its judge (Burrichter) and the usual twelve\r\nelected sentence-finders (Schoffen), its Vogt, and its greve or\r\ncommander of the local militia.(43) The story of early London before the\r\nConquest--Mr. Green says--is that \"of a number of little groups\r\nscattered here and there over the area within the walls, each growing up\r\nwith its own life and institutions, guilds, sokes, religious houses and\r\nthe like, and only slowly drawing together into a municipal union.\"(44)\r\nAnd if we refer to the annals of the Russian cities, Novgorod and Pskov,\r\nboth of which are relatively rich in local details, we find the section\r\n(konets) consisting of independent streets (ulitsa), each of which,\r\nthough chiefly peopled with artisans of a certain craft, had also\r\nmerchants and landowners among its inhabitants, and was a separate\r\ncommunity. It had the communal responsibility of all members in case of\r\ncrime, its own jurisdiction and administration by street aldermen\r\n(ulichanskiye starosty), its own seal and, in case of need, its own\r\nforum; its own militia, as also its self-elected priests and its, own\r\ncollective life and collective enterprise.(45)\r\n\r\nThe medieval city thus appears as a double federation: of all\r\nhouseholders united into small territorial unions--the street, the\r\nparish, the section--and of individuals united by oath into guilds\r\naccording to their professions; the former being a produce of the\r\nvillage-community origin of the city, while the second is a subsequent\r\ngrowth called to life by new conditions.\r\n\r\nTo guarantee liberty, self-administration, and peace was the chief aim\r\nof the medieval city; and labour, as we shall presently see when\r\nspeaking of the craft guilds, was its chief foundation. But \"production\"\r\ndid not absorb the whole attention of the medieval economist. With his\r\npractical mind, he understood that \"consumption\" must be guaranteed in\r\norder to obtain production; and therefore, to provide for \"the common\r\nfirst food and lodging of poor and rich alike\" (gemeine notdurft und\r\ngemach armer und richer(46)) was the fundamental principle in each city.\r\nThe purchase of food supplies and other first necessaries (coal, wood,\r\netc.) before they had reached the market, or altogether in especially\r\nfavourable conditions from which others would be excluded--the\r\npreempcio, in a word--was entirely prohibited. Everything had to go to\r\nthe market and be offered there for every one's purchase, till the\r\nringing of the bell had closed the market. Then only could the retailer\r\nbuy the remainder, and even then his profit should be an \"honest profit\"\r\nonly.(47) Moreover, when corn was bought by a baker wholesale after the\r\nclose of the market, every citizen had the right to claim part of the\r\ncorn (about half-a-quarter) for his own use, at wholesale price, if he\r\ndid so before the final conclusion of the bargain; and reciprocally,\r\nevery baker could claim the same if the citizen purchased corn for\r\nre-selling it. In the first case, the corn had only to be brought to the\r\ntown mill to be ground in its proper turn for a settled price, and the\r\nbread could be baked in the four banal, or communal oven.(48) In short,\r\nif a scarcity visited the city, all had to suffer from it more or less;\r\nbut apart from the calamities, so long as the free cities existed no one\r\ncould die in their midst from starvation, as is unhappily too often the\r\ncase in our own times.\r\n\r\nHowever, all such regulations belong to later periods of the cities'\r\nlife, while at an earlier period it was the city itself which used to\r\nbuy all food supplies for the use of the citizens. The documents\r\nrecently published by Mr. Gross are quite positive on this point and\r\nfully support his conclusion to the effect that the cargoes of\r\nsubsistences \"were purchased by certain civic officials in the name of\r\nthe town, and then distributed in shares among the merchant burgesses,\r\nno one being allowed to buy wares landed in the port unless the\r\nmunicipal authorities refused to purchase them. This seem--she adds--to\r\nhave been quite a common practice in England, Ireland, Wales and\r\nScotland.\"(49) Even in the sixteenth century we find that common\r\npurchases of corn were made for the \"comoditie and profitt in all things\r\nof this.... Citie and Chamber of London, and of all the Citizens and\r\nInhabitants of the same as moche as in us lieth\"--as the Mayor wrote in\r\n1565.(50) In Venice, the whole of the trade in corn is well known to\r\nhave been in the hands of the city; the \"quarters,\" on receiving the\r\ncereals from the board which administrated the imports, being bound to\r\nsend to every citizen's house the quantity allotted to him.(51) In\r\nFrance, the city of Amiens used to purchase salt and to distribute it to\r\nall citizens at cost price;(52) and even now one sees in many French\r\ntowns the halles which formerly were municipal depots for corn and\r\nsalt.(53) In Russia it was a regular custom in Novgorod and Pskov.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter relative to the communal purchases for the use of the\r\ncitizens, and the manner in which they used to be made, seems not to\r\nhave yet received proper attention from the historians of the period;\r\nbut there are here and there some very interesting facts which throw a\r\nnew light upon it. Thus there is, among Mr. Gross's documents, a\r\nKilkenny ordinance of the year 1367, from which we learn how the prices\r\nof the goods were established. \"The merchants and the sailors,\" Mr.\r\nGross writes, \"were to state on oath the first cost of the goods and the\r\nexpenses of transportation. Then the mayor of the town and two discreet\r\nmen were to name the price at which the wares were to be sold.\" The same\r\nrule held good in Thurso for merchandise coming \"by sea or land.\" This\r\nway of \"naming the price\" so well answers to the very conceptions of\r\ntrade which were current in medieval times that it must have been all\r\nbut universal. To have the price established by a third person was a\r\nvery old custom; and for all interchange within the city it certainly\r\nwas a widely-spread habit to leave the establishment of prices to\r\n\"discreet men\"--to a third party--and not to the vendor or the buyer.\r\nBut this order of things takes us still further back in the history of\r\ntrade--namely, to a time when trade in staple produce was carried on by\r\nthe whole city, and the merchants were only the commissioners, the\r\ntrustees, of the city for selling the goods which it exported. A\r\nWaterford ordinance, published also by Mr. Gross, says \"that all manere\r\nof marchandis what so ever kynde thei be of ... shal be bought by the\r\nMaire and balives which bene commene biers [common buyers, for the town]\r\nfor the time being, and to distribute the same on freemen of the citie\r\n(the propre goods of free citisains and inhabitants only excepted).\"\r\nThis ordinance can hardly be explained otherwise than by admitting that\r\nall the exterior trade of the town was carried on by its agents.\r\nMoreover, we have direct evidence of such having been the case for\r\nNovgorod and Pskov. It was the Sovereign Novgorod and the Sovereign\r\nPskov who sent their caravans of merchants to distant lands.\r\n\r\nWe know also that in nearly all medieval cities of Middle and Western\r\nEurope, the craft guilds used to buy, as a body, all necessary raw\r\nproduce, and to sell the produce of their work through their officials,\r\nand it is hardly possible that the same should not have been done for\r\nexterior trade--the more so as it is well known that up to the\r\nthirteenth century, not only all merchants of a given city were\r\nconsidered abroad as responsible in a body for debts contracted by any\r\none of them, but the whole city as well was responsible for the debts of\r\neach one of its merchants. Only in the twelfth and thirteenth century\r\nthe towns on the Rhine entered into special treaties abolishing this\r\nresponsibility.(54) And finally we have the remarkable Ipswich document\r\npublished by Mr. Gross, from which document we learn that the merchant\r\nguild of this town was constituted by all who had the freedom of the\r\ncity, and who wished to pay their contribution (\"their hanse\") to the\r\nguild, the whole community discussing all together how better to\r\nmaintain the merchant guild, and giving it certain privileges. The\r\nmerchant guild of Ipswich thus appears rather as a body of trustees of\r\nthe town than as a common private guild.\r\n\r\nIn short, the more we begin to know the mediaeval city the more we see\r\nthat it was not simply a political organization for the protection of\r\ncertain political liberties. It was an attempt at organizing, on a much\r\ngrander scale than in a village community, a close union for mutual aid\r\nand support, for consumption and production, and for social life\r\naltogether, without imposing upon men the fetters of the State, but\r\ngiving full liberty of expression to the creative genius of each\r\nseparate group of individuals in art, crafts, science, commerce, and\r\npolitical organization. How far this attempt has been successful will be\r\nbest seen when we have analyzed in the next chapter the organization of\r\nlabour in the medieval city and the relations of the cities with the\r\nsurrounding peasant population.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1.

Arnold, in his Wanderungen und Ansiedelungen der deutschen Stamme,\r\np. 431, even maintains that one-half of the now arable area in middle\r\nGermany must have been reclaimed from the sixth to the ninth century.\r\nNitzsch (Geschichte des deutschen Volkes, Leipzig, 1883, vol. i.) shares\r\nthe same opinion.\r\n\r\n2.

According to the Riparian law, the sword, the spear, and\r\nthe iron armour of a warrior attained the value of at least twenty-five\r\ncows, or two years of a freeman's labour. A cuirass alone was valued in\r\nthe Salic law (Desmichels, quoted by Michelet) at as much as thirty-six\r\nbushels of wheat.\r\n\r\n4.

The king being at that time\r\nthe executioner of his own sentences (as the tribe formerly was of its\r\nown sentences), he had to be protected by a special disposition, the\r\nmore so as several Lombardian kings before Rothari had been slain in\r\nsuccession (Leo and Botta, l.c., i. 66-90).\r\n\r\n12.

If I thus follow the views long since advocated by Maurer\r\n(Geschichte der Stadteverfassung in Deutschland, Erlangen, 1869), it is\r\nbecause he has fully proved the uninterrupted evolution from the village\r\ncommunity to the mediaeval city, and that his views alone can explain\r\nthe universality of the communal movement. Savigny and Eichhorn and\r\ntheir followers have certainly proved that the traditions of the Roman\r\nmunicipia had never totally disappeared. But they took no account of the\r\nvillage community period which the barbarians lived through before they\r\nhad any cities. The fact is, that whenever mankind made a new start in\r\ncivilization, in Greece, Rome, or middle Europe, it passed through the\r\nsame stages--the tribe, the village community, the free city, the\r\nstate--each one naturally evolving out of the preceding stage. Of\r\ncourse, the experience of each preceding civilization was never lost.\r\nGreece (itself influenced by Eastern civilizations) influenced Rome, and\r\nRome influenced our civilization; but each of them begin from the same\r\nbeginning--the tribe. And just as we cannot say that our states are\r\ncontinuations of the Roman state, so also can we not say that the\r\nmediaeval cities of Europe (including Scandinavia and Russia) were a\r\ncontinuation of the Roman cities. They were a continuation of the\r\nbarbarian village community, influenced to a certain extent by the\r\ntraditions of the Roman towns.\r\n\r\n15. M.

It is even certain\r\nthat Moscow and Paris were chosen by the kings and the Church as the\r\ncradles of the future royal authority in the State, because they did not\r\npossess the tradition of folkmotes accustomed to act as sovereign in all\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n19.

In medieval times, only secret aggression was treated as a murder.\r\nBlood-revenge in broad daylight was justice; and slaying in a quarrel\r\nwas not murder, once the aggressor showed his willingness to repent and\r\nto repair the wrong he had done. Deep traces of this distinction still\r\nexist in modern criminal law, especially in Russia.\r\n\r\n32. Kofod Ancher, l.c. This old booklet contains much that has been lost\r\nsight of by later explorers.\r\n\r\n33. They played an important part in the revolts of the serfs, and were\r\ntherefore prohibited several times in succession in the second half of\r\nthe ninth century. Of course, the king's prohibitions remained a dead\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n34. The medieval Italian painters were also organized in guilds, which\r\nbecame at a later epoch Academies of art. If the Italian art of those\r\ntimes is impressed with so much individuality that we distinguish, even\r\nnow, between the different schools of Padua, Bassano, Treviso, Verona,\r\nand so on, although all these cities were under the sway of Venice, this\r\nwas due--J. Paul Richter remarks--to the fact that the painters of each\r\ncity belonged to a separate guild, friendly with the guilds of other\r\ntowns, but leading a separate existence. The oldest guild-statute known\r\nis that of Verona, dating from 1303, but evidently copied from some much\r\nolder statute. \"Fraternal assistance in necessity of whatever kind,\"\r\n\"hospitality towards strangers, when passing through the town, as thus\r\ninformation may be obtained about matters which one may like to learn,\"\r\nand \"obligation of offering comfort in case of debility\" are among the\r\nobligations of the members (Nineteenth Century, Nov. 1890, and Aug.\r\n1892).\r\n\r\n35. The chief works on the artels are named in the article \"Russia\" of\r\nthe Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th edition, p. 84.\r\n\r\n36. See, for instance, the texts of the Cambridge guilds given by\r\nToulmin Smith (English Guilds, London, 1870, pp. 274-276), from which it\r\nappears that the \"generall and principall day\" was the \"eleccioun day;\"\r\nor, Ch. M. Clode's The Early History of the Guild of the Merchant\r\nTaylors, London, 1888, i. 45; and so on. For the renewal of allegiance,\r\nsee the Jomsviking saga, mentioned in Pappenheim's Altdanische\r\nSchutzgilden, Breslau, 1885, p. 67. It appears very probable that when\r\nthe guilds began to be prosecuted, many of them inscribed in their\r\nstatutes the meal day only, or their pious duties, and only alluded to\r\nthe judicial function of the guild in vague words; but this function did\r\nnot disappear till a very much later time. The question, \"Who will be my\r\njudge?\" has no meaning now, since the State has appropriated for its\r\nbureaucracy the organization of justice; but it was of primordial\r\nimportance in medieval times, the more so as self-jurisdiction meant\r\nself-administration. It must also be remarked that the translation of\r\nthe Saxon and Danish \"guild-bretheren,\" or \"brodre,\" by the Latin\r\nconvivii must also have contributed to the above confusion.\r\n\r\n37.

The craftguilds:\r\nState-attributes in each of them. Attitude of the city towards the\r\npeasants; attempts to free them. The lords. Results achieved by the\r\nmedieval city: in arts, in learning. Causes of decay.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe medieval cities were not organized upon some preconceived plan in\r\nobedience to the will of an outside legislator. Each of them was a\r\nnatural growth in the full sense of the word--an always varying result\r\nof struggle between various forces which adjusted and re-adjusted\r\nthemselves in conformity with their relative energies, the chances of\r\ntheir conflicts, and the support they found in their surroundings.\r\nTherefore, there are not two cities whose inner organization and\r\ndestinies would have been identical. Each one, taken separately, varies\r\nfrom century to century. And yet, when we cast a broad glance upon all\r\nthe cities of Europe, the local and national unlikenesses disappear, and\r\nwe are struck to find among all of them a wonderful resemblance,\r\nalthough each has developed for itself, independently from the others,\r\nand in different conditions. A small town in the north of Scotland, with\r\nits population of coarse labourers and fishermen; a rich city of\r\nFlanders, with its world-wide commerce, luxury, love of amusement and\r\nanimated life; an Italian city enriched by its intercourse with the\r\nEast, and breeding within its walls a refined artistic taste and\r\ncivilization; and a poor, chiefly agricultural, city in the marsh and\r\nlake district of Russia, seem to have little in common. And\r\nnevertheless, the leading lines of their organization, and the spirit\r\nwhich animates them, are imbued with a strong family likeness.\r\nEverywhere we see the same federations of small communities and guilds,\r\nthe same \"sub-towns\" round the mother city, the same folkmote, and the\r\nsame insigns of its independence. The defensor of the city, under\r\ndifferent names and in different accoutrements, represents the same\r\nauthority and interests; food supplies, labour and commerce, are\r\norganized on closely similar lines; inner and outer struggles are fought\r\nwith like ambitions; nay, the very formulae used in the struggles, as\r\nalso in the annals, the ordinances, and the rolls, are identical; and\r\nthe architectural monuments, whether Gothic, Roman, or Byzantine in\r\nstyle, express the same aspirations and the same ideals; they are\r\nconceived and built in the same way. Many dissemblances are mere\r\ndifferences of age, and those disparities between sister cities which\r\nare real are repeated in different parts of Europe. The unity of the\r\nleading idea and the identity of origin make up for differences of\r\nclimate, geographical situation, wealth, language and religion. This is\r\nwhy we can speak of the medieval city as of a well-defined phase of\r\ncivilization; and while every research insisting upon local and\r\nindividual differences is most welcome, we may still indicate the chief\r\nlines of development which are common to all cities.(1)\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the protection which used to be accorded to the\r\nmarket-place from the earliest barbarian times has played an important,\r\nthough not an exclusive, part in the emancipation of the medieval city.\r\nThe early barbarians knew no trade within their village communities;\r\nthey traded with strangers only, at certain definite spots, on certain\r\ndetermined days. And, in order that the stranger might come to the\r\nbarter-place without risk of being slain for some feud which might be\r\nrunning between two kins, the market was always placed under the special\r\nprotection of all kins. It was inviolable, like the place of worship\r\nunder the shadow of which it was held. With the Kabyles it is still\r\nannaya, like the footpath along which women carry water from the well;\r\nneither must be trodden upon in arms, even during inter-tribal wars. In\r\nmedieval times the market universally enjoyed the same protection.(2) No\r\nfeud could be prosecuted on the place whereto people came to trade, nor\r\nwithin a certain radius from it; and if a quarrel arose in the motley\r\ncrowd of buyers and sellers, it had to be brought before those under\r\nwhose protection the market stood--the community's tribunal, or the\r\nbishop's, the lord's, or the king's judge. A stranger who came to trade\r\nwas a guest, and he went on under this very name. Even the lord who had\r\nno scruples about robbing a merchant on the high road, respected the\r\nWeichbild, that is, the pole which stood in the market-place and bore\r\neither the king's arms, or a glove, or the image of the local saint, or\r\nsimply a cross, according to whether the market was under the protection\r\nof the king, the lord, the local church, or the folkmote--the vyeche.(3)\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand how the self-jurisdiction of the city could\r\ndevelop out of the special jurisdiction in the market-place, when this\r\nlast right was conceded, willingly or not, to the city itself. And such\r\nan origin of the city's liberties, which can be traced in very many\r\ncases, necessarily laid a special stamp upon their subsequent\r\ndevelopment. It gave a predominance to the trading part of the\r\ncommunity. The burghers who possessed a house in the city at the time\r\nbeing, and were co-owners in the town-lands, constituted very often a\r\nmerchant guild which held in its hands the city's trade; and although at\r\nthe outset every burgher, rich and poor, could make part of the merchant\r\nguild, and the trade itself seems to have been carried on for the entire\r\ncity by its trustees, the guild gradually became a sort of privileged\r\nbody. It jealously prevented the outsiders who soon began to flock into\r\nthe free cities from entering the guild, and kept the advantages\r\nresulting from trade for the few \"families\" which had been burghers at\r\nthe time of the emancipation. There evidently was a danger of a merchant\r\noligarchy being thus constituted. But already in the tenth, and still\r\nmore during the two next centuries, the chief crafts, also organized in\r\nguilds, were powerful enough to check the oligarchic tendencies of the\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\nThe craft guild was then a common seller of its produce and a common\r\nbuyer of the raw materials, and its members were merchants and manual\r\nworkers at the same time. Therefore, the predominance taken by the old\r\ncraft guilds from the very beginnings of the free city life guaranteed\r\nto manual labour the high position which it afterwards occupied in the\r\ncity.(4) In fact, in a medieval city manual labour was no token of\r\ninferiority; it bore, on the contrary, traces of the high respect it had\r\nbeen kept in in the village community. Manual labour in a \"mystery\" was\r\nconsidered as a pious duty towards the citizens: a public function\r\n(Amt), as honourable as any other. An idea of \"justice\" to the\r\ncommunity, of \"right\" towards both producer and consumer, which would\r\nseem so extravagant now, penetrated production and exchange. The\r\ntanner's, the cooper's, or the shoemaker's work must be \"just,\" fair,\r\nthey wrote in those times. Wood, leather or thread which are used by the\r\nartisan must be \"right\"; bread must be baked \"in justice,\" and so on.\r\nTransport this language into our present life, and it would seem\r\naffected and unnatural; but it was natural and unaffected then, because\r\nthe medieval artisan did not produce for an unknown buyer, or to throw\r\nhis goods into an unknown market. He produced for his guild first; for a\r\nbrotherhood of men who knew each other, knew the technics of the craft,\r\nand, in naming the price of each product, could appreciate the skill\r\ndisplayed in its fabrication or the labour bestowed upon it. Then the\r\nguild, not the separate producer, offered the goods for sale in the\r\ncommunity, and this last, in its turn, offered to the brotherhood of\r\nallied communities those goods which were exported, and assumed\r\nresponsibility for their quality. With such an organization, it was the\r\nambition of each craft not to offer goods of inferior quality, and\r\ntechnical defects or adulterations became a matter concerning the whole\r\ncommunity, because, an ordinance says, \"they would destroy public\r\nconfidence.\"(5) Production being thus a social duty, placed under the\r\ncontrol of the whole amitas, manual labour could not fall into the\r\ndegraded condition which it occupies now, so long as the free city was\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nA difference between master and apprentice, or between master and worker\r\n(compayne, Geselle), existed but in the medieval cities from their very\r\nbeginnings; this was at the outset a mere difference of age and skill,\r\nnot of wealth and power. After a seven years' apprenticeship, and after\r\nhaving proved his knowledge and capacities by a work of art, the\r\napprentice became a master himself. And only much later, in the\r\nsixteenth century, after the royal power had destroyed the city and the\r\ncraft organization, was it possible to become master in virtue of simple\r\ninheritance or wealth. But this was also the time of a general decay in\r\nmedieval industries and art.\r\n\r\nThere was not much room for hired work in the early flourishing periods\r\nof the medieval cities, still less for individual hirelings. The work of\r\nthe weavers, the archers, the smiths, the bakers, and so on, was\r\nperformed for the craft and the city; and when craftsmen were hired in\r\nthe building trades, they worked as temporary corporations (as they\r\nstill do in the Russian artels), whose work was paid en bloc. Work for a\r\nmaster began to multiply only later on; but even in this case the worker\r\nwas paid better than he is paid now, even in this country, and very much\r\nbetter than he used to be paid all over Europe in the first half of this\r\ncentury. Thorold Rogers has familiarized English readers with this idea;\r\nbut the same is true for the Continent as well, as is shown by the\r\nresearches of Falke and Schonberg, and by many occasional indications.\r\nEven in the fifteenth century a mason, a carpenter, or a smith worker\r\nwould be paid at Amiens four sols a day, which corresponded to\r\nforty-eight pounds of bread, or to the eighth part of a small ox\r\n(bouvard). In Saxony, the salary of the Geselle in the building trade\r\nwas such that, to put it in Falke's words, he could buy with his six\r\ndays' wages three sheep and one pair of shoes.(6) The donations of\r\nworkers (Geselle) to cathedrals also bear testimony of their relative\r\nwell-being, to say nothing of the glorious donations of certain craft\r\nguilds nor of what they used to spend in festivities and pageants.(7) In\r\nfact, the more we learn about the medieval city, the more we are\r\nconvinced that at no time has labour enjoyed such conditions of\r\nprosperity and such respect as when city life stood at its highest.\r\n\r\nMore than that; not only many aspirations of our modern radicals were\r\nalready realized in the middle ages, but much of what is described now\r\nas Utopian was accepted then as a matter of fact. We are laughed at when\r\nwe say that work must be pleasant, but--\"every one must be pleased with\r\nhis work,\" a medieval Kuttenberg ordinance says, \"and no one shall,\r\nwhile doing nothing (mit nichts thun), appropriate for himself what\r\nothers have produced by application and work, because laws must be a\r\nshield for application and work.\"(8) And amidst all present talk about\r\nan eight hours' day, it may be well to remember an ordinance of\r\nFerdinand the First relative to the Imperial coal mines, which settled\r\nthe miner's day at eight hours, \"as it used to be of old\" (wie vor\r\nAlters herkommen), and work on Saturday afternoon was prohibited. Longer\r\nhours were very rare, we are told by Janssen, while shorter hours were\r\nof common occurrence. In this country, in the fifteenth century, Rogers\r\nsays, \"the workmen worked only forty-eight hours a week.\"(9) The\r\nSaturday half-holiday, too, which we consider as a modern conquest, was\r\nin reality an old medieval institution; it was bathing-time for a great\r\npart of the community, while Wednesday afternoon was bathing-time for\r\nthe Geselle.(10) And although school meals did not exist--probably\r\nbecause no children went hungry to school--a distribution of bath-money\r\nto the children whose parents found difficulty in providing it was\r\nhabitual in several places. As to Labour Congresses, they also were a\r\nregular Feature of the middles ages. In some parts of Germany craftsmen\r\nof the same trade, belonging to different communes, used to come\r\ntogether every year to discuss questions relative to their trade, the\r\nyears of apprenticeship, the wandering years, the wages, and so on; and\r\nin 1572, the Hanseatic towns formally recognized the right of the crafts\r\nto come together at periodical congresses, and to take any resolutions,\r\nso long as they were not contrary to the cities' rolls, relative to the\r\nquality of goods. Such Labour Congresses, partly international like the\r\nHansa itself, are known to have been held by bakers, founders, smiths,\r\ntanners, sword-makers and cask-makers.(11)\r\n\r\nThe craft organization required, of course, a close supervision of the\r\ncraftsmen by the guild, and special jurates were always nominated for\r\nthat purpose. But it is most remarkable that, so long as the cities\r\nlived their free life, no complaints were heard about the supervision;\r\nwhile, after the State had stepped in, confiscating the property of the\r\nguilds and destroying their independence in favour of its own\r\nbureaucracy, the complaints became simply countless.(12) On the other\r\nhand, the immensity of progress realized in all arts under the mediaeval\r\nguild system is the best proof that the system was no hindrance to\r\nindividual initiative.(13) The fact is, that the medieval guild, like\r\nthe medieval parish, \"street,\" or \"quarter,\" was not a body of citizens,\r\nplaced under the control of State functionaries; it was a union of all\r\nmen connected with a given trade: jurate buyers of raw produce, sellers\r\nof manufactured goods, and artisans--masters, \"compaynes,\" and\r\napprentices. For the inner organization of the trade its assembly was\r\nsovereign, so long as it did not hamper the other guilds, in which case\r\nthe matter was brought before the guild of the guilds--the city. But\r\nthere was in it something more than that. It had its own\r\nself-jurisdiction, its own military force, its own general assemblies,\r\nits own traditions of struggles, glory, and independence, its own\r\nrelations with other guilds of the same trade in other cities: it had,\r\nin a word, a full organic life which could only result from the\r\nintegrality of the vital functions. When the town was called to arms,\r\nthe guild appeared as a separate company (Schaar), armed with its own\r\narms (or its own guns, lovingly decorated by the guild, at a subsequent\r\nepoch), under its own self-elected commanders. It was, in a word, as\r\nindependent a unit of the federation as the republic of Uri or Geneva\r\nwas fifty years ago in the Swiss Confederation. So that, to compare it\r\nwith a modern trade union, divested of all attributes of State\r\nsovereignty, and reduced to a couple of functions of secondary\r\nimportance, is as unreasonable as to compare Florence or Brugge with a\r\nFrench commune vegetating under the Code Napoleon, or with a Russian\r\ntown placed under Catherine the Second's municipal law. Both have\r\nelected mayors, and the latter has also its craft corporations; but the\r\ndifference is--all the difference that exists between Florence and\r\nFontenay-les-Oies or Tsarevokokshaisk, or between a Venetian doge and a\r\nmodern mayor who lifts his hat before the sous-prefet's clerk.\r\n\r\nThe medieval guilds were capable of maintaining their independence; and,\r\nlater on, especially in the fourteenth century, when, in consequence of\r\nseveral causes which shall presently be indicated, the old municipal\r\nlife underwent a deep modification, the younger crafts proved strong\r\nenough to conquer their due share in the management of the city affairs.\r\nThe masses, organized in \"minor\" arts, rose to wrest the power out of\r\nthe hands of a growing oligarchy, and mostly succeeded in this task,\r\nopening again a new era of prosperity. True, that in some cities the\r\nuprising was crushed in blood, and mass decapitations of workers\r\nfollowed, as was the case in Paris in 1306, and in Cologne in 1371. In\r\nsuch cases the city's liberties rapidly fell into decay, and the city\r\nwas gradually subdued by the central authority. But the majority of the\r\ntowns had preserved enough of vitality to come out of the turmoil with a\r\nnew life and vigour.(14) A new period of rejuvenescence was their\r\nreward. New life was infused, and it found its expression in splendid\r\narchitectural monuments, in a new period of prosperity, in a sudden\r\nprogress of technics and invention, and in a new intellectual movement\r\nleading to the Renaissance and to the Reformation.\r\n\r\nThe life of a mediaeval city was a succession of hard battles to conquer\r\nliberty and to maintain it. True, that a strong and tenacious race of\r\nburghers had developed during those fierce contests; true, that love and\r\nworship of the mother city had been bred by these struggles, and that\r\nthe grand things achieved by the mediaeval communes were a direct\r\noutcome of that love. But the sacrifices which the communes had to\r\nsustain in the battle for freedom were, nevertheless, cruel, and left\r\ndeep traces of division on their inner life as well. Very few cities had\r\nsucceeded, under a concurrence of favourable circumstances, in obtaining\r\nliberty at one stroke, and these few mostly lost it equally easily;\r\nwhile the great number had to fight fifty or a hundred years in\r\nsuccession, often more, before their rights to free life had been\r\nrecognized, and another hundred years to found their liberty on a firm\r\nbasis--the twelfth century charters thus being but one of the\r\nstepping-stones to freedom.(15) In reality, the mediaeval city was a\r\nfortified oasis amidst a country plunged into feudal submission, and it\r\nhad to make room for itself by the force of its arms. In consequence of\r\nthe causes briefly alluded to in the preceding chapter, each village\r\ncommunity had gradually fallen under the yoke of some lay or clerical\r\nlord. His house had grown to be a castle, and his brothers-in-arms were\r\nnow the scum of adventurers, always ready to plunder the peasants. In\r\naddition to three days a week which the peasants had to work for the\r\nlord, they had also to bear all sorts of exactions for the right to sow\r\nand to crop, to be gay or sad, to live, to marry, or to die. And, worst\r\nof all, they were continually plundered by the armed robbers of some\r\nneighbouring lord, who chose to consider them as their master's kin, and\r\nto take upon them, and upon their cattle and crops, the revenge for a\r\nfeud he was fighting against their owner. Every meadow, every field,\r\nevery river, and road around the city, and every man upon the land was\r\nunder some lord.\r\n\r\nThe hatred of the burghers towards the feudal barons has found a most\r\ncharacteristic expression in the wording of the different charters which\r\nthey compelled them to sign. Heinrich V. is made to sign in the charter\r\ngranted to Speier in 1111, that he frees the burghers from \"the horrible\r\nand execrable law of mortmain, through which the town has been sunk into\r\ndeepest poverty\" (von dem scheusslichen und nichtswurdigen Gesetze,\r\nwelches gemein Budel genannt wird, Kallsen, i. 307). The coutume of\r\nBayonne, written about 1273, contains such passages as these: \"The\r\npeople is anterior to the lords. It is the people, more numerous than\r\nall others, who, desirous of peace, has made the lords for bridling and\r\nknocking down the powerful ones,\" and so on (Giry, Etablissements de\r\nRouen, i. 117, Quoted by Luchaire, p. 24). A charter submitted for King\r\nRobert's signature is equally characteristic. He is made to say in it:\r\n\"I shall rob no oxen nor other animals. I shall seize no merchants, nor\r\ntake their moneys, nor impose ransom. From Lady Day to the All Saints'\r\nDay I shall seize no horse, nor mare, nor foals, in the meadows. I shall\r\nnot burn the mills, nor rob the flour ... I shall offer no protection to\r\nthieves,\" etc. (Pfister has published that document, reproduced by\r\nLuchaire). The charter \"granted\" by the Besancon Archbishop Hugues, in\r\nwhich he has been compelled to enumerate all the mischiefs due to his\r\nmortmain rights, is equally characteristic.(16) And so on.\r\n\r\nFreedom could not be maintained in such surroundings, and the cities\r\nwere compelled to carry on the war outside their walls. The burghers\r\nsent out emissaries to lead revolt in the villages; they received\r\nvillages into their corporations, and they waged direct war against the\r\nnobles. It Italy, where the land was thickly sprinkled with feudal\r\ncastles, the war assumed heroic proportions, and was fought with a stern\r\nacrimony on both sides. Florence sustained for seventy-seven years a\r\nsuccession of bloody wars, in order to free its contado from the nobles;\r\nbut when the conquest had been accomplished (in 1181) all had to begin\r\nanew. The nobles rallied; they constituted their own leagues in\r\nopposition to the leagues of the towns, and, receiving fresh support\r\nfrom either the Emperor or the Pope, they made the war last for another\r\n130 years. The same took place in Rome, in Lombardy, all over Italy.\r\n\r\nProdigies of valour, audacity, and tenaciousness were displayed by the\r\ncitizens in these wars. But the bows and the hatchets of the arts and\r\ncrafts had not always the upper hand in their encounters with the\r\narmour-clad knights, and many castles withstood the ingenious\r\nsiege-machinery and the perseverance of the citizens. Some cities, like\r\nFlorence, Bologna, and many towns in France, Germany, and Bohemia,\r\nsucceeded in emancipating the surrounding villages, and they were\r\nrewarded for their efforts by an extraordinary prosperity and\r\ntranquillity. But even here, and still more in the less strong or less\r\nimpulsive towns, the merchants and artisans, exhausted by war, and\r\nmisunderstanding their own interests, bargained over the peasants'\r\nheads. They compelled the lord to swear allegiance to the city; his\r\ncountry castle was dismantled, and he agreed to build a house and to\r\nreside in the city, of which he became a co-burgher (com-bourgeois,\r\ncon-cittadino); but he maintained in return most of his rights upon the\r\npeasants, who only won a partial relief from their burdens. The burgher\r\ncould not understand that equal rights of citizenship might be granted\r\nto the peasant upon whose food supplies he had to rely, and a deep rent\r\nwas traced between town and village. In some cases the peasants simply\r\nchanged owners, the city buying out the barons' rights and selling them\r\nin shares to her own citizens.(17) Serfdom was maintained, and only much\r\nlater on, towards the end of the thirteenth century, it was the craft\r\nrevolution which undertook to put an end to it, and abolished personal\r\nservitude, but dispossessed at the same time the serfs of the land.(18)\r\nIt hardly need be added that the fatal results of such policy were soon\r\nfelt by the cities themselves; the country became the city's enemy.\r\n\r\nThe war against the castles had another bad effect. It involved the\r\ncities in a long succession of mutual wars, which have given origin to\r\nthe theory, till lately in vogue, namely, that the towns lost their\r\nindependence through their own jealousies and mutual fights. The\r\nimperialist historians have especially supported this theory, which,\r\nhowever, is very much undermined now by modern research. It is certain\r\nthat in Italy cities fought each other with a stubborn animosity, but\r\nnowhere else did such contests attain the same proportions; and in Italy\r\nitself the city wars, especially those of the earlier period, had their\r\nspecial causes. They were (as was already shown by Sismondi and Ferrari)\r\na mere continuation of the war against the castles--the free municipal\r\nand federative principle unavoidably entering into a fierce contest with\r\nfeudalism, imperialism, and papacy. Many towns which had but partially\r\nshaken off the yoke of the bishop, the lord, or the Emperor, were simply\r\ndriven against the free cities by the nobles, the Emperor, and Church,\r\nwhose policy was to divide the cities and to arm them against each\r\nother. These special circumstances (partly reflected on to Germany also)\r\nexplain why the Italian towns, some of which sought support with the\r\nEmperor to combat the Pope, while the others sought support from the\r\nChurch to resist the Emperor, were soon divided into a Gibelin and a\r\nGuelf camp, and why the same division appeared in each separate\r\ncity.(19)\r\n\r\nThe immense economical progress realized by most italian cities just at\r\nthe time when these wars were hottest,(20) and the alliances so easily\r\nconcluded between towns, still better characterize those struggles and\r\nfurther undermine the above theory. Already in the years 1130-1150\r\npowerful leagues came into existence; and a few years later, when\r\nFrederick Barbarossa invaded Italy and, supported by the nobles and some\r\nretardatory cities, marched against Milan, popular enthusiasm was roused\r\nin many towns by popular preachers. Crema, Piacenza, Brescia, Tortona,\r\netc., went to the rescue; the banners of the guilds of Verona, Padua,\r\nVicenza, and Trevisa floated side by side in the cities' camp against\r\nthe banners of the Emperor and the nobles. Next year the Lombardian\r\nLeague came into existence, and sixty years later we see it reinforced\r\nby many other cities, and forming a lasting organization which had half\r\nof its federal war-chest in Genoa and the other half in Venice.(21) In\r\nTuscany, Florence headed another powerful league, to which Lucca,\r\nBologna, Pistoia, etc., belonged, and which played an important part in\r\ncrushing down the nobles in middle Italy, while smaller leagues were of\r\ncommon occurrence. It is thus certain that although petty jealousies\r\nundoubtedly existed, and discord could be easily sown, they did not\r\nprevent the towns from uniting together for the common defence of\r\nliberty. Only later on, when separate cities became little States, wars\r\nbroke out between them, as always must be the case when States struggle\r\nfor supremacy or colonies.\r\n\r\nSimilar leagues were formed in Germany for the same purpose. When, under\r\nthe successors of Conrad, the land was the prey of interminable feuds\r\nbetween the nobles, the Westphalian towns concluded a league against the\r\nknights, one of the clauses of which was never to lend money to a knight\r\nwho would continue to conceal stolen goods.(22) When \"the knights and\r\nthe nobles lived on plunder, and murdered whom they chose to murder,\" as\r\nthe Wormser Zorn complains, the cities on the Rhine (Mainz, Cologne,\r\nSpeier, Strasburg, and Basel) took the initiative of a league which soon\r\nnumbered sixty allied towns, repressed the robbers, and maintained\r\npeace. Later on, the league of the towns of Suabia, divided into three\r\n\"peace districts\" (Augsburg, Constance, and Ulm), had the same purpose.\r\nAnd even when such leagues were broken,(23) they lived long enough to\r\nshow that while the supposed peacemakers--the kings, the emperors, and\r\nthe Church-fomented discord, and were themselves helpless against the\r\nrobber knights, it was from the cities that the impulse came for\r\nre-establishing peace and union. The cities--not the emperors--were the\r\nreal makers of the national unity.(24)\r\n\r\nSimilar federations were organized for the same purpose among small\r\nvillages, and now that attention has been drawn to this subject by\r\nLuchaire we may expect soon to learn much more about them. Villages\r\njoined into small federations in the contado of Florence, so also in the\r\ndependencies of Novgorod and Pskov. As to France, there is positive\r\nevidence of a federation of seventeen peasant villages which has existed\r\nin the Laonnais for nearly a hundred years (till 1256), and has fought\r\nhard for its independence. Three more peasant republics, which had sworn\r\ncharters similar to those of Laon and Soissons, existed in the\r\nneighbourhood of Laon, and, their territories being contiguous, they\r\nsupported each other in their liberation wars. Altogether, Luchaire is\r\nof the opinion that many such federations must have come into existence\r\nin France in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, but that documents\r\nrelative to them are mostly lost. Of course, being unprotected by walls,\r\nthey could easily be crushed down by the kings and the lords; but in\r\ncertain favourable circumstances, when they found support in a league of\r\ntowns and protection in their mountains, such peasant republics became\r\nindependent units of the Swiss Confederation.(25)\r\n\r\nAs to unions between cities for peaceful purposes, they were of quite\r\ncommon occurrence. The intercourse which had been established during the\r\nperiod of liberation was not interrupted afterwards. Sometimes, when the\r\nscabini of a German town, having to pronounce judgment in a new or\r\ncomplicated case, declared that they knew not the sentence (des\r\nUrtheiles nicht weise zu sein), they sent delegates to another city to\r\nget the sentence. The same happened also in France;(26) while Forli and\r\nRavenna are known to have mutually naturalized their citizens and\r\ngranted them full rights in both cities. To submit a contest arisen\r\nbetween two towns, or within a city, to another commune which was\r\ninvited to act as arbiter, was also in the spirit of the times.(27) As\r\nto commercial treaties between cities, they were quite habitual.(28)\r\nUnions for regulating the production and the sizes of casks which were\r\nused for the commerce in wine, \"herring unions,\" and so on, were mere\r\nprecursors of the great commercial federations of the Flemish Hansa,\r\nand, later on, of the great North German Hansa, the history of which\r\nalone might contribute pages and pages to illustrate the federation\r\nspirit which permeated men at that time. It hardly need be added, that\r\nthrough the Hanseatic unions the medieval cities have contributed more\r\nto the development of international intercourse, navigation, and\r\nmaritime discovery than all the States of the first seventeen centuries\r\nof our era.\r\n\r\nIn a word, federations between small territorial units, as well as among\r\nmen united by common pursuits within their respective guilds, and\r\nfederations between cities and groups of cities constituted the very\r\nessence of life and thought during that period. The first five of the\r\nsecond decade of centuries of our era may thus be described as an\r\nimmense attempt at securing mutual aid and support on a grand scale, by\r\nmeans of the principles of federation and association carried on through\r\nall manifestations of human life and to all possible degrees. This\r\nattempt was attended with success to a very great extent. It united men\r\nformerly divided; it secured them a very great deal of freedom, and it\r\ntenfolded their forces. At a time when particularism was bred by so many\r\nagencies, and the causes of discord and jealousy might have been so\r\nnumerous, it is gratifying to see that cities scattered over a wide\r\ncontinent had so much in common, and were so ready to confederate for\r\nthe prosecution of so many common aims. They succumbed in the long run\r\nbefore powerful enemies; not having understood the mutual-aid principle\r\nwidely enough, they themselves committed fatal faults; but they did not\r\nperish through their own jealousies, and their errors were not a want of\r\nfederation spirit among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe results of that new move which mankind made in the medieval city\r\nwere immense. At the beginning of the eleventh century the towns of\r\nEurope were small clusters of miserable huts, adorned but with low\r\nclumsy churches, the builders of which hardly knew how to make an arch;\r\nthe arts, mostly consisting of some weaving and forging, were in their\r\ninfancy; learning was found in but a few monasteries. Three hundred and\r\nfifty years later, the very face of Europe had been changed. The land\r\nwas dotted with rich cities, surrounded by immense thick walls which\r\nwere embellished by towers and gates, each of them a work of art in\r\nitself. The cathedrals, conceived in a grand style and profusely\r\ndecorated, lifted their bell-towers to the skies, displaying a purity of\r\nform and a boldness of imagination which we now vainly strive to attain.\r\nThe crafts and arts had risen to a degree of perfection which we can\r\nhardly boast of having superseded in many directions, if the inventive\r\nskill of the worker and the superior finish of his work be appreciated\r\nhigher than rapidity of fabrication. The navies of the free cities\r\nfurrowed in all directions the Northern and the Southern Mediterranean;\r\none effort more, and they would cross the oceans. Over large tracts of\r\nland well-being had taken the place of misery; learning had grown and\r\nspread. The methods of science had been elaborated; the basis of natural\r\nphilosophy had been laid down; and the way had been paved for all the\r\nmechanical inventions of which our own times are so proud. Such were the\r\nmagic changes accomplished in Europe in less than four hundred years.\r\nAnd the losses which Europe sustained through the loss of its free\r\ncities can only be understood when we compare the seventeenth century\r\nwith the fourteenth or the thirteenth. The prosperity which formerly\r\ncharacterized Scotland, Germany, the plains of Italy, was gone. The\r\nroads had fallen into an abject state, the cities were depopulated,\r\nlabour was brought into slavery, art had vanished, commerce itself was\r\ndecaying.(29)\r\n\r\nIf the medieval cities had bequeathed to us no written documents to\r\ntestify of their splendour, and left nothing behind but the monuments of\r\nbuilding art which we see now all over Europe, from Scotland to Italy,\r\nand from Gerona in Spain to Breslau in Slavonian territory, we might yet\r\nconclude that the times of independent city life were times of the\r\ngreatest development of human intellect during the Christian era down to\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century. On looking, for instance, at a\r\nmedieval picture representing Nuremberg with its scores of towers and\r\nlofty spires, each of which bore the stamp of free creative art, we can\r\nhardly conceive that three hundred years before the town was but a\r\ncollection of miserable hovels. And our admiration grows when we go into\r\nthe details of the architecture and decorations of each of the countless\r\nchurches, bell-towers, gates, and communal houses which are scattered\r\nall over Europe as far east as Bohemia and the now dead towns of Polish\r\nGalicia. Not only Italy, that mother of art, but all Europe is full of\r\nsuch monuments. The very fact that of all arts architecture--a social\r\nart above all--had attained the highest development, is significant in\r\nitself. To be what it was, it must have originated from an eminently\r\nsocial life.\r\n\r\nMedieval architecture attained its grandeur--not only because it was a\r\nnatural development of handicraft; not only because each building, each\r\narchitectural decoration, had been devised by men who knew through the\r\nexperience of their own hands what artistic effects can be obtained from\r\nstone, iron, bronze, or even from simple logs and mortar; not only\r\nbecause, each monument was a result of collective experience,\r\naccumulated in each \"mystery\" or craft(30)--it was grand because it was\r\nborn out of a grand idea. Like Greek art, it sprang out of a conception\r\nof brotherhood and unity fostered by the city. It had an audacity which\r\ncould only be won by audacious struggles and victories; it had that\r\nexpression of vigour, because vigour permeated all the life of the city.\r\nA cathedral or a communal house symbolized the grandeur of an organism\r\nof which every mason and stone-cutter was the builder, and a medieval\r\nbuilding appears--not as a solitary effort to which thousands of slaves\r\nwould have contributed the share assigned them by one man's imagination;\r\nall the city contributed to it. The lofty bell-tower rose upon a\r\nstructure, grand in itself, in which the life of the city was\r\nthrobbing--not upon a meaningless scaffold like the Paris iron tower,\r\nnot as a sham structure in stone intended to conceal the ugliness of an\r\niron frame, as has been done in the Tower Bridge. Like the Acropolis of\r\nAthens, the cathedral of a medieval city was intended to glorify the\r\ngrandeur of the victorious city, to symbolize the union of its crafts,\r\nto express the glory of each citizen in a city of his own creation.\r\nAfter having achieved its craft revolution, the city often began a new\r\ncathedral in order to express the new, wider, and broader union which\r\nhad been called into life.\r\n\r\nThe means at hand for these grand undertakings were disproportionately\r\nsmall. Cologne Cathedral was begun with a yearly outlay of but 500\r\nmarks; a gift of 100 marks was inscribed as a grand donation;(31) and\r\neven when the work approached completion, and gifts poured in in\r\nproportion, the yearly outlay in money stood at about 5,000 marks, and\r\nnever exceeded 14,000. The cathedral of Basel was built with equally\r\nsmall means. But each corporation contributed its part of stone, work,\r\nand decorative genius to their common monument. Each guild expressed in\r\nit its political conceptions, telling in stone or in bronze the history\r\nof the city, glorifying the principles of \"Liberty, equality, and\r\nfraternity,\"(32) praising the city's allies, and sending to eternal fire\r\nits enemies. And each guild bestowed its love upon the communal monument\r\nby richly decorating it with stained windows, paintings, \"gates, worthy\r\nto be the gates of Paradise,\" as Michel Angelo said, or stone\r\ndecorations of each minutest corner of the building.(33) Small cities,\r\neven small parishes,(34) vied with the big agglomerations in this work,\r\nand the cathedrals of Laon and St. Ouen hardly stand behind that of\r\nRheims, or the Communal House of Bremen, or the folkmote's bell-tower of\r\nBreslau. \"No works must be begun by the commune but such as are\r\nconceived in response to the grand heart of the commune, composed of the\r\nhearts of all citizens, united in one common will\"--such were the words\r\nof the Council of Florence; and this spirit appears in all communal\r\nworks of common utility, such as the canals, terraces, vineyards, and\r\nfruit gardens around Florence, or the irrigation canals which\r\nintersected the plains of Lombardy, or the port and aqueduct of Genoa,\r\nor, in fact, any works of the kind which were achieved by almost every\r\ncity.(35)\r\n\r\nAll arts had progressed in the same way in the medieval cities, those of\r\nour own days mostly being but a continuation of what had grown at that\r\ntime. The prosperity of the Flemish cities was based upon the fine\r\nwoollen cloth they fabricated. Florence, at the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century, before the black death, fabricated from 70,000 to\r\n100,000 panni of woollen stuffs, which were valued at 1,200,000 golden\r\nflorins.(36) The chiselling of precious metals, the art of casting, the\r\nfine forging of iron, were creations of the mediaeval \"mysteries\" which\r\nhad succeeded in attaining in their own domains all that could be made\r\nby the hand, without the use of a powerful prime motor. By the hand and\r\nby invention, because, to use Whewell's words:\r\n\r\n\"Parchment and paper, printing and engraving, improved glass and steel,\r\ngunpowder, clocks, telescopes, the mariner's compass, the reformed\r\ncalendar, the decimal notation; algebra, trigonometry, chemistry,\r\ncounterpoint (an invention equivalent to a new creation of music); these\r\nare all possessions which we inherit from that which has so\r\ndisparagingly been termed the Stationary Period\" (History of Inductive\r\nSciences, i. 252).\r\n\r\nTrue that no new principle was illustrated by any of these discoveries,\r\nas Whewell said; but medieval science had done something more than the\r\nactual discovery of new principles. It had prepared the discovery of all\r\nthe new principles which we know at the present time in mechanical\r\nsciences: it had accustomed the explorer to observe facts and to reason\r\nfrom them. It was inductive science, even though it had not yet fully\r\ngrasped the importance and the powers of induction; and it laid the\r\nfoundations of both mechanics and natural philosophy. Francis Bacon,\r\nGalileo, and Copernicus were the direct descendants of a Roger Bacon and\r\na Michael Scot, as the steam engine was a direct product of the\r\nresearches carried on in the Italian universities on the weight of the\r\natmosphere, and of the mathematical and technical learning which\r\ncharacterized Nuremberg.\r\n\r\nBut why should one take trouble to insist upon the advance of science\r\nand art in the medieval city? Is it not enough to point to the\r\ncathedrals in the domain of skill, and to the Italian language and the\r\npoem of Dante in the domain of thought, to give at once the measure of\r\nwhat the medieval city created during the four centuries it lived?\r\n\r\nThe medieval cities have undoubtedly rendered an immense service to\r\nEuropean civilization. They have prevented it from being drifted into\r\nthe theocracies and despotical states of old; they have endowed it with\r\nthe variety, the self-reliance, the force of initiative, and the immense\r\nintellectual and material energies it now possesses, which are the best\r\npledge for its being able to resist any new invasion of the East. But\r\nwhy did these centres of civilization, which attempted to answer to\r\ndeeply-seated needs of human nature, and were so full of life, not live\r\nfurther on? Why were they seized with senile debility in the sixteenth\r\ncentury? and, after having repulsed so many assaults from without, and\r\nonly borrowed new vigour from their interior struggles, why did they\r\nfinally succumb to both?\r\n\r\nVarious causes contributed to this effect, some of them having their\r\nroots in the remote past, while others originated in the mistakes\r\ncommitted by the cities themselves. Towards the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, mighty States, reconstructed on the old Roman pattern, were\r\nalready coming into existence. In each country and each region some\r\nfeudal lord, more cunning, more given to hoarding, and often less\r\nscrupulous than his neighbours, had succeeded in appropriating to\r\nhimself richer personal domains, more peasants on his lands, more\r\nknights in his following, more treasures in his chest. He had chosen for\r\nhis seat a group of happily-situated villages, not yet trained into free\r\nmunicipal life--Paris, Madrid, or Moscow--and with the labour of his\r\nserfs he had made of them royal fortified cities, whereto he attracted\r\nwar companions by a free distribution of villages, and merchants by the\r\nprotection he offered to trade. The germ of a future State, which began\r\ngradually to absorb other similar centres, was thus laid. Lawyers,\r\nversed in the study of Roman law, flocked into such centres; a tenacious\r\nand ambitious race of men issued from among the burgesses, who equally\r\nhated the naughtiness of the lords and what they called the lawlessness\r\nof the peasants. The very forms of the village community, unknown to\r\ntheir code, the very principles of federalism were repulsive to them as\r\n\"barbarian\" inheritances. Caesarism, supported by the fiction of popular\r\nconsent and by the force of arms, was their ideal, and they worked hard\r\nfor those who promised to realize it.(37)\r\n\r\nThe Christian Church, once a rebel against Roman law and now its ally,\r\nworked in the same direction. The attempt at constituting the theocratic\r\nEmpire of Europe having proved a failure, the more intelligent and\r\nambitious bishops now yielded support to those whom they reckoned upon\r\nfor reconstituting the power of the Kings of Israel or of the Emperors\r\nof Constantinople. The Church bestowed upon the rising rulers her\r\nsanctity, she crowned them as God's representatives on earth, she\r\nbrought to their service the learning and the statesmanship of her\r\nministers, her blessings and maledictions, her riches, and the\r\nsympathies she had retained among the poor. The peasants, whom the\r\ncities had failed or refused to free, on seeing the burghers impotent to\r\nput an end to the interminable wars between the knights--which wars they\r\nhad so dearly to pay for--now set their hopes upon the King, the\r\nEmperor, or the Great Prince; and while aiding them to crush down the\r\nmighty feudal owners, they aided them to constitute the centralized\r\nState. And finally, the invasions of the Mongols and the Turks, the holy\r\nwar against the Maures in Spain, as well as the terrible wars which soon\r\nbroke out between the growing centres of sovereignty--Ile de France and\r\nBurgundy, Scotland and England, England and France, Lithuania and\r\nPoland, Moscow and Tver, and so on--contributed to the same end. Mighty\r\nStates made their appearance; and the cities had now to resist not only\r\nloose federations of lords, but strongly-organized centres, which had\r\narmies of serfs at their disposal.\r\n\r\nThe worst was, that the growing autocracies found support in the\r\ndivisions which had grown within the cities themselves. The fundamental\r\nidea of the medieval city was grand, but it was not wide enough. Mutual\r\naid and support cannot be limited to a small association; they must\r\nspread to its surroundings, or else the surroundings will absorb the\r\nassociation. And in this respect the medieval citizen had committed a\r\nformidable mistake at the outset. Instead of looking upon the peasants\r\nand artisans who gathered under the protection of his walls as upon so\r\nmany aids who would contribute their part to the making of the city--as\r\nthey really did--a sharp division was traced between the \"families\" of\r\nold burghers and the newcomers. For the former, all benefits from\r\ncommunal trade and communal lands were reserved, and nothing was left\r\nfor the latter but the right of freely using the skill of their own\r\nhands. The city thus became divided into \"the burghers\" or \"the\r\ncommonalty,\" and \"the inhabitants.\"(38) The trade, which was formerly\r\ncommunal, now became the privilege of the merchant and artisan\r\n\"families,\" and the next step--that of becoming individual, or the\r\nprivilege of oppressive trusts--was unavoidable.\r\n\r\nThe same division took place between the city proper and the surrounding\r\nvillages. The commune had well tried to free the peasants, but her wars\r\nagainst the lords became, as already mentioned, wars for freeing the\r\ncity itself from the lords, rather than for freeing the peasants. She\r\nleft to the lord his rights over the villeins, on condition that he\r\nwould molest the city no more and would become co-burgher. But the\r\nnobles \"adopted\" by the city, and now residing within its walls, simply\r\ncarried on the old war within the very precincts of the city. They\r\ndisliked to submit to a tribunal of simple artisans and merchants, and\r\nfought their old feuds in the streets. Each city had now its Colonnas\r\nand Orsinis, its Overstolzes and Wises. Drawing large incomes from the\r\nestates they had still retained, they surrounded themselves with\r\nnumerous clients and feudalized the customs and habits of the city\r\nitself. And when discontent began to be felt in the artisan classes of\r\nthe town, they offered their sword and their followers to settle the\r\ndifferences by a free fight, instead of letting the discontent find out\r\nthe channels which it did not fail to secure itself in olden times.\r\n\r\nThe greatest and the most fatal error of most cities was to base their\r\nwealth upon commerce and industry, to the neglect of agriculture. They\r\nthus repeated the error which had once been committed by the cities of\r\nantique Greece, and they fell through it into the same crimes.(39) The\r\nestrangement of so many cities from the land necessarily drew them into\r\na policy hostile to the land, which became more and more evident in the\r\ntimes of Edward the Third,(40) the French Jacqueries, the Hussite wars,\r\nand the Peasant War in Germany. On the other hand, a commercial policy\r\ninvolved them in distant enterprises. Colonies were founded by the\r\nItalians in the south-east, by German cities in the east, by Slavonian\r\ncities in the far northeast. Mercenary armies began to be kept for\r\ncolonial wars, and soon for local defence as well. Loans were contacted\r\nto such an extent as to totally demoralize the citizens; and internal\r\ncontests grew worse and worse at each election, during which the\r\ncolonial politics in the interest of a few families was at stake. The\r\ndivision into rich and poor grew deeper, and in the sixteenth century,\r\nin each city, the royal authority found ready allies and support among\r\nthe poor.\r\n\r\nAnd there is yet another cause of the decay of communal institutions,\r\nwhich stands higher and lies deeper than all the above. The history of\r\nthe medieval cities offers one of the most striking illustrations of the\r\npower of ideas and principles upon the destinies of mankind, and of the\r\nquite opposed results which are obtained when a deep modification of\r\nleading ideas has taken place. Self-reliance and federalism, the\r\nsovereignty of each group, and the construction of the political body\r\nfrom the simple to the composite, were the leading ideas in the eleventh\r\ncentury. But since that time the conceptions had entirely changed. The\r\nstudents of Roman law and the prelates of the Church, closely bound\r\ntogether since the time of Innocent the Third, had succeeded in\r\nparalyzing the idea--the antique Greek idea--which presided at the\r\nfoundation of the cities. For two or three hundred years they taught\r\nfrom the pulpit, the University chair, and the judges' bench, that\r\nsalvation must be sought for in a strongly-centralized State, placed\r\nunder a semi-divine authority;(41) that one man can and must be the\r\nsaviour of society, and that in the name of public salvation he can\r\ncommit any violence: burn men and women at the stake, make them perish\r\nunder indescribable tortures, plunge whole provinces into the most\r\nabject misery. Nor did they fail to give object lessons to this effect\r\non a grand scale, and with an unheard-of cruelty, wherever the king's\r\nsword and the Church's fire, or both at once, could reach. By these\r\nteachings and examples, continually repeated and enforced upon public\r\nattention, the very minds of the citizens had been shaped into a new\r\nmould. They began to find no authority too extensive, no killing by\r\ndegrees too cruel, once it was \"for public safety.\" And, with this new\r\ndirection of mind and this new belief in one man's power, the old\r\nfederalist principle faded away, and the very creative genius of the\r\nmasses died out. The Roman idea was victorious, and in such\r\ncircumstances the centralized State had in the cities a ready prey.\r\n\r\nFlorence in the fifteenth century is typical of this change. Formerly a\r\npopular revolution was the signal of a new departure. Now, when the\r\npeople, brought to despair, insurged, it had constructive ideas no more;\r\nno fresh idea came out of the movement. A thousand representatives were\r\nput into the Communal Council instead of 400; 100 men entered the\r\nsignoria instead of 80. But a revolution of figures could be of no\r\navail. The people's discontent was growing up, and new revolts followed.\r\nA saviour--the \"tyran\"--was appealed to; he massacred the rebels, but\r\nthe disintegration of the communal body continued worse than ever. And\r\nwhen, after a new revolt, the people of Florence appealed to their most\r\npopular man, Gieronimo Savonarola, for advice, the monk's answer\r\nwas:--\"Oh, people mine, thou knowest that I cannot go into State affairs\r\n... purify thy soul, and if in such a disposition of mind thou reformest\r\nthy city, then, people of Florence, thou shalt have inaugurated the\r\nreform in all Italy!\" Carnival masks and vicious books were burned, a\r\nlaw of charity and another against usurers were passed--and the\r\ndemocracy of Florence remained where it was. The old spirit had gone. By\r\ntoo much trusting to government, they had ceased to trust to themselves;\r\nthey were unable to open new issues. The State had only to step in and\r\nto crush down their last liberties.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the current of mutual aid and support did not die out in the\r\nmasses, it continued to flow even after that defeat. It rose up again\r\nwith a formidable force, in answer to the communist appeals of the first\r\npropagandists of the reform, and it continued to exist even after the\r\nmasses, having failed to realize the life which they hoped to inaugurate\r\nunder the inspiration of a reformed religion, fell under the dominions\r\nof an autocratic power. It flows still even now, and it seeks its way to\r\nfind out a new expression which would not be the State, nor the medieval\r\ncity, nor the village community of the barbarians, nor the savage clan,\r\nbut would proceed from all of them, and yet be superior to them in its\r\nwider and more deeply humane conceptions.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1. The literature of the subject is immense; but there is no work yet\r\nwhich treats of the medieval city as of a whole. For the French\r\nCommunes, Augustin Thierry's Lettres and Considerations sur l'histoire\r\nde France still remain classical, and Luchaire's Communes francaises is\r\nan excellent addition on the same lines. For the cities of Italy, the\r\ngreat work of Sismondi (Histoire des republiques italiennes du moyen\r\nage, Paris, 1826, 16 vols.), Leo and Botta's History of Italy, Ferrari's\r\nRevolutions d'Italie, and Hegel's Geschichte der Stadteverfassung in\r\nItalien, are the chief sources of general information. For Germany we\r\nhave Maurer's Stadteverfassung, Barthold's Geschichte der deutschen\r\nStadte, and, of recent works, Hegel's Stadte und Gilden der germanischen\r\nVolker (2 vols. Leipzig, 1891), and Dr. Otto Kallsen's Die deutschen\r\nStadte im Mittelalter (2 vols. Halle, 1891), as also Janssen's\r\nGeschichte des deutschen Volkes (5 vols. 1886), which, let us hope, will\r\nsoon be translated into English (French translation in 1892). For\r\nBelgium, A. Wauters, Les Libertes communales (Bruxelles, 1869-78, 3\r\nvols.). For Russia, Byelaeff's, Kostomaroff's and Sergievich's works.\r\nAnd finally, for England, we posses one of the best works on cities of a\r\nwider region in Mrs. J.R. Green's Town Life in the Fifteenth Century (2\r\nvols. London, 1894). We have, moreover, a wealth of well-known local\r\nhistories, and several excellent works of general or economical history\r\nwhich I have so often mentioned in this and the preceding chapter. The\r\nrichness of literature consists, however, chiefly in separate, sometimes\r\nadmirable, researches into the history of separate cities, especially\r\nItalian and German; the guilds; the land question; the economical\r\nprinciples of the time; the economical importance of guilds and crafts;\r\nthe leagues between, cities (the Hansa); and communal art. An incredible\r\nwealth of information is contained in works of this second category, of\r\nwhich only some of the more important are named in these pages.\r\n\r\n2. Kulischer, in an excellent essay on primitive trade (Zeitschrift für\r\nVolkerpsychologie, Bd. x. 380), also points out that, according to\r\nHerodotus, the Argippaeans were considered inviolable, because the trade\r\nbetween the Scythians and the northern tribes took place on their\r\nterritory. A fugitive was sacred on their territory, and they were often\r\nasked to act as arbiters for their neighbours. See Appendix XI.\r\n\r\n3. Some discussion has lately taken place upon the Weichbild and the\r\nWeichbild-law, which still remain obscure (see Zopfl, Alterthumer des\r\ndeutschen Reichs und Rechts, iii. 29; Kallsen, i. 316). The above\r\nexplanation seems to be the more probable, but, of course, it must be\r\ntested by further research. It is also evident that, to use a Scotch\r\nexpression, the \"mercet cross\" could be considered as an emblem of\r\nChurch jurisdiction, but we find it both in bishop cities and in those\r\nin which the folkmote was sovereign.\r\n\r\n4. For all concerning the merchant guild see Mr. Gross's exhaustive\r\nwork, The Guild Merchant (Oxford, 1890, 2 vols.); also Mrs. Green's\r\nremarks in Town Life in the Fifteenth Century, vol. ii. chaps. v. viii.\r\nx; and A. Doren's review of the subject in Schmoller's Forschungen, vol.\r\nxii. If the considerations indicated in the previous chapter (according\r\nto which trade was communal at its beginnings) prove to be correct, it\r\nwill be permissible to suggest as a probable hypothesis that the guild\r\nmerchant was a body entrusted with commerce in the interest of the whole\r\ncity, and only gradually became a guild of merchants trading for\r\nthemselves; while the merchant adventurers of this country, the Novgorod\r\npovolniki (free colonizers and merchants) and the mercati personati,\r\nwould be those to whom it was left to open new markets and new branches\r\nof commerce for themselves. Altogether, it must be remarked that the\r\norigin of the mediaeval city can be ascribed to no separate agency. It\r\nwas a result of many agencies in different degrees.\r\n\r\n5.

To quote but one example out of many which may be found in\r\nSchonberg's and Falke's works, the sixteen shoemaker workers\r\n(Schusterknechte) of the town Xanten, on the Rhine, gave, for erecting a\r\nscreen and an altar in the church, 75 guldens of subscriptions, and 12\r\nguldens out of their box, which money was worth, according to the best\r\nvaluations, ten times its present value.\r\n\r\n8.

At Paris, the\r\nday of labour varied from seven to eight hours in the winter to fourteen\r\nhours in summer in certain trades, while in others it was from eight to\r\nnine hours in winter, to from ten to twelve in Summer. All work was\r\nstopped on Saturdays and on about twenty-five other days (jours de\r\ncommun de vile foire) at four o'clock, while on Sundays and thirty other\r\nholidays there was no work at all. The general conclusion is, that the\r\nmedieval worker worked less hours, all taken, than the present-day\r\nworker (Dr. E. Martin Saint-Leon, Histoire des corporations, p. 121).\r\n\r\n11. W.

See Toulmin Smith's deeply-felt remarks about the royal spoliation\r\nof the guilds, in Miss Smith's Introduction to English Guilds. In France\r\nthe same royal spoliation and abolition of the guilds' jurisdiction was\r\nbegun from 1306, and the final blow was struck in 1382 (Fagniez, l.c.\r\npp. 52-54).\r\n\r\n13. Adam Smith and his contemporaries knew well what they were\r\ncondemning when they wrote against the State interference in trade and\r\nthe trade monopolies of State creation. Unhappily, their followers, with\r\ntheir hopeless superficiality, flung medieval guilds and State\r\ninterference into the same sack, making no distinction between a\r\nVersailles edict and a guild ordinance. It hardly need be said that the\r\neconomists who have seriously studied the subject, like Schonberg (the\r\neditor of the well-known course of Political Economy), never fell into\r\nsuch an error. But, till lately, diffuse discussions of the above type\r\nwent on for economical \"science.\"\r\n\r\n14. In Florence the seven minor arts made their revolution in 1270-82,\r\nand its results are fully described by Perrens (Histoire de Florence,\r\nParis, 1877, 3 vols.), and especially by Gino Capponi (Storia della\r\nrepubblica di Firenze, 2da edizione, 1876, i. 58-80; translated into\r\nGerman). In Lyons, on the contrary, where the movement of the minor\r\ncrafts took place in 1402, the latter were defeated and lost the right\r\nof themselves nominating their own judges. The two parties came\r\napparently to a compromise. In Rostock the same movement took place in\r\n1313; in Zurich in 1336; in Bern in 1363; in Braunschweig in 1374, and\r\nnext year in Hamburg; in Lubeck in 1376-84; and so on. See Schmoller's\r\nStrassburg zur Zeit der Zunftkampfe and Strassburg's Bluthe; Brentano's\r\nArbeitergilden der Gegenwart, 2 vols., Leipzig, 1871-72; Eb. Bain's\r\nMerchant and Craft Guilds, Aberdeen, 1887, pp. 26-47, 75, etc. As to Mr.\r\nGross's opinion relative to the same struggles in England, see Mrs.\r\nGreen's remarks in her Town Life in the Fifteenth Century, ii. 190-217;\r\nalso the chapter on the Labour Question, and, in fact, the whole of this\r\nextremely interesting volume. Brentano's views on the crafts' struggles,\r\nexpressed especially in iii. and iv. of his essay \"On the History and\r\nDevelopment of Guilds,\" in Toulmin Smith's English Guilds remain\r\nclassical for the subject, and may be said to have been again and again\r\nconfirmed by subsequent research.\r\n\r\n15. To give but one example--Cambrai made its first revolution in 907,\r\nand, after three or four more revolts, it obtained its charter in 1076.\r\nThis charter was repealed twice (1107 and 1138), and twice obtained\r\nagain (in 1127 and 1180). Total, 223 years of struggles before\r\nconquering the right to independence. Lyons--from 1195 to 1320.\r\n\r\n16. See Tuetey, \"Etude sur Le droit municipal ... en Franche-Comte,\" in\r\nMemoires de la Societe d'emulation de Montbeliard, 2e serie, ii. 129\r\nseq.\r\n\r\n17. This seems to have been often the case in Italy. In Switzerland,\r\nBern bought even the towns of Thun and Burgdorf.\r\n\r\n18. Such was, at least, the case in the cities of Tuscany (Florence,\r\nLucca, Sienna, Bologna, etc.), for which the relations between city and\r\npeasants are best known. (Luchitzkiy, \"Slavery and Russian Slaves in\r\nFlorence,\" in Kieff University Izvestia for 1885, who has perused\r\nRumohr's Ursprung der Besitzlosigkeit der Colonien in Toscana, 1830.)\r\nThe whole matter concerning the relations between the cities and the\r\npeasants requires much more study than has hitherto been done.\r\n\r\n19.

Every member, every moulding, becomes a sustainer of\r\nweight; and by the multiplicity of props assisting each other, and the\r\nconsequent subdivision of weight, the eye was satisfied of the stability\r\nof the structure, notwithstanding curiously slender aspects of the\r\nseparate parts.\" An art which sprang out of the social life of the city\r\ncould not be better characterized.\r\n\r\n31.

Mutual Aid\r\ninstitutions of the present time. The village community; its struggles\r\nfor resisting its abolition by the State. Habits derived from the\r\nvillage-community life, retained in our modern villages. Switzerland,\r\nFrance, Germany, Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mutual-aid tendency in man has so remote an origin, and is so deeply\r\ninterwoven with all the past evolution of the human race, that it has\r\nbeen maintained by mankind up to the present time, notwithstanding all\r\nvicissitudes of history. It was chiefly evolved during periods of peace\r\nand prosperity; but when even the greatest calamities befell men--when\r\nwhole countries were laid waste by wars, and whole populations were\r\ndecimated by misery, or groaned under the yoke of tyranny--the same\r\ntendency continued to live in the villages and among the poorer classes\r\nin the towns; it still kept them together, and in the long run it\r\nreacted even upon those ruling, fighting, and devastating minorities\r\nwhich dismissed it as sentimental nonsense. And whenever mankind had to\r\nwork out a new social organization, adapted to a new phasis of\r\ndevelopment, its constructive genius always drew the elements and the\r\ninspiration for the new departure from that same ever-living tendency.\r\nNew economical and social institutions, in so far as they were a\r\ncreation of the masses, new ethical systems, and new religions, all have\r\noriginated from the same source, and the ethical progress of our race,\r\nviewed in its broad lines, appears as a gradual extension of the\r\nmutual-aid principles from the tribe to always larger and larger\r\nagglomerations, so as to finally embrace one day the whole of mankind,\r\nwithout respect to its divers creeds, languages, and races.\r\n\r\nAfter having passed through the savage tribe, and next through the\r\nvillage community, the Europeans came to work out in medieval times a\r\nnew form of organization, which had the advantage of allowing great\r\nlatitude for individual initiative, while it largely responded at the\r\nsame time to man's need of mutual support. A federation of village\r\ncommunities, covered by a network of guilds and fraternities, was called\r\ninto existence in the medieval cities. The immense results achieved\r\nunder this new form of union--in well-being for all, in industries, art,\r\nscience, and commerce--were discussed at some length in two preceding\r\nchapters, and an attempt was also made to show why, towards the end of\r\nthe fifteenth century, the medieval republics--surrounded by domains of\r\nhostile feudal lords, unable to free the peasants from servitude, and\r\ngradually corrupted by ideas of Roman Caesarism--were doomed to become a\r\nprey to the growing military States.\r\n\r\nHowever, before submitting for three centuries to come, to the\r\nall-absorbing authority of the State, the masses of the people made a\r\nformidable attempt at reconstructing society on the old basis of mutual\r\naid and support. It is well known by this time that the great movement\r\nof the reform was not a mere revolt against the abuses of the Catholic\r\nChurch. It had its constructive ideal as well, and that ideal was life\r\nin free, brotherly communities. Those of the early writings and sermons\r\nof the period which found most response with the masses were imbued with\r\nideas of the economical and social brotherhood of mankind. The \"Twelve\r\nArticles\" and similar professions of faith, which were circulated among\r\nthe German and Swiss peasants and artisans, maintained not only every\r\none's right to interpret the Bible according to his own understanding,\r\nbut also included the demand of communal lands being restored to the\r\nvillage communities and feudal servitudes being abolished, and they\r\nalways alluded to the \"true\" faith--a faith of brotherhood. At the same\r\ntime scores of thousands of men and women joined the communist\r\nfraternities of Moravia, giving them all their fortune and living in\r\nnumerous and prosperous settlements constructed upon the principles of\r\ncommunism.(1) Only wholesale massacres by the thousand could put a stop\r\nto this widely-spread popular movement, and it was by the sword, the\r\nfire, and the rack that the young States secured their first and\r\ndecisive victory over the masses of the people.(2)\r\n\r\nFor the next three centuries the States, both on the Continent and in\r\nthese islands, systematically weeded out all institutions in which the\r\nmutual-aid tendency had formerly found its expression. The village\r\ncommunities were bereft of their folkmotes, their courts and independent\r\nadministration; their lands were confiscated. The guilds were spoliated\r\nof their possessions and liberties, and placed under the control, the\r\nfancy, and the bribery of the State's official. The cities were divested\r\nof their sovereignty, and the very springs of their inner life--the\r\nfolkmote, the elected justices and administration, the sovereign parish\r\nand the sovereign guild--were annihilated; the State's functionary took\r\npossession of every link of what formerly was an organic whole. Under\r\nthat fatal policy and the wars it engendered, whole regions, once\r\npopulous and wealthy, were laid bare; rich cities became insignificant\r\nboroughs; the very roads which connected them with other cities became\r\nimpracticable. Industry, art, and knowledge fell into decay. Political\r\neducation, science, and law were rendered subservient to the idea of\r\nState centralization. It was taught in the Universities and from the\r\npulpit that the institutions in which men formerly used to embody their\r\nneeds of mutual support could not be tolerated in a properly organized\r\nState; that the State alone could represent the bonds of union between\r\nits subjects; that federalism and \"particularism\" were the enemies of\r\nprogress, and the State was the only proper initiator of further\r\ndevelopment. By the end of the last century the kings on the Continent,\r\nthe Parliament in these isles, and the revolutionary Convention in\r\nFrance, although they were at war with each other, agreed in asserting\r\nthat no separate unions between citizens must exist within the State;\r\nthat hard labour and death were the only suitable punishments to workers\r\nwho dared to enter into \"coalitions.\" \"No state within the State!\" The\r\nState alone, and the State's Church, must take care of matters of\r\ngeneral interest, while the subjects must represent loose aggregations\r\nof individuals, connected by no particular bonds, bound to appeal to the\r\nGovernment each time that they feel a common need. Up to the middle of\r\nthis century this was the theory and practice in Europe. Even commercial\r\nand industrial societies were looked at with suspicion. As to the\r\nworkers, their unions were treated as unlawful almost within our own\r\nlifetime in this country and within the last twenty years on the\r\nContinent. The whole system of our State education was such that up to\r\nthe present time, even in this country, a notable portion of society\r\nwould treat as a revolutionary measure the concession of such rights as\r\nevery one, freeman or serf, exercised five hundred years ago in the\r\nvillage folkmote, the guild, the parish, and the city.\r\n\r\nThe absorption of all social functions by the State necessarily favoured\r\nthe development of an unbridled, narrow-minded individualism. In\r\nproportion as the obligations towards the State grew in numbers the\r\ncitizens were evidently relieved from their obligations towards each\r\nother. In the guild--and in medieval times every man belonged to some\r\nguild or fraternity two \"brothers\" were bound to watch in turns a\r\nbrother who had fallen ill; it would be sufficient now to give one's\r\nneighbour the address of the next paupers' hospital. In barbarian\r\nsociety, to assist at a fight between two men, arisen from a quarrel,\r\nand not to prevent it from taking a fatal issue, meant to be oneself\r\ntreated as a murderer; but under the theory of the all-protecting State\r\nthe bystander need not intrude: it is the policeman's business to\r\ninterfere, or not. And while in a savage land, among the Hottentots, it\r\nwould be scandalous to eat without having loudly called out thrice\r\nwhether there is not somebody wanting to share the food, all that a\r\nrespectable citizen has to do now is to pay the poor tax and to let the\r\nstarving starve. The result is, that the theory which maintains that men\r\ncan, and must, seek their own happiness in a disregard of other people's\r\nwants is now triumphant all round in law, in science, in religion. It is\r\nthe religion of the day, and to doubt of its efficacy is to be a\r\ndangerous Utopian. Science loudly proclaims that the struggle of each\r\nagainst all is the leading principle of nature, and of human societies\r\nas well. To that struggle Biology ascribes the progressive evolution of\r\nthe animal world. History takes the same line of argument; and political\r\neconomists, in their naive ignorance, trace all progress of modern\r\nindustry and machinery to the \"wonderful\" effects of the same principle.\r\nThe very religion of the pulpit is a religion of individualism, slightly\r\nmitigated by more or less charitable relations to one's neighbours,\r\nchiefly on Sundays. \"Practical\" men and theorists, men of science and\r\nreligious preachers, lawyers and politicians, all agree upon one\r\nthing--that individualism may be more or less softened in its harshest\r\neffects by charity, but that it is the only secure basis for the\r\nmaintenance of society and its ulterior progress.\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, hopeless to look for mutual-aid institutions and\r\npractices in modern society. What could remain of them? And yet, as soon\r\nas we try to ascertain how the millions of human beings live, and begin\r\nto study their everyday relations, we are struck with the immense part\r\nwhich the mutual-aid and mutual-support principles play even now-a-days\r\nin human life. Although the destruction of mutual-aid institutions has\r\nbeen going on in practice and theory, for full three or four hundred\r\nyears, hundreds of millions of men continue to live under such\r\ninstitutions; they piously maintain them and endeavour to reconstitute\r\nthem where they have ceased to exist. In our mutual relations every one\r\nof us has his moments of revolt against the fashionable individualistic\r\ncreed of the day, and actions in which men are guided by their mutual\r\naid inclinations constitute so great a part of our daily intercourse\r\nthat if a stop to such actions could be put all further ethical progress\r\nwould be stopped at once. Human society itself could not be maintained\r\nfor even so much as the lifetime of one single generation. These facts,\r\nmostly neglected by sociologists and yet of the first importance for the\r\nlife and further elevation of mankind, we are now going to analyze,\r\nbeginning with the standing institutions of mutual support, and passing\r\nnext to those acts of mutual aid which have their origin in personal or\r\nsocial sympathies.\r\n\r\nWhen we cast a broad glance on the present constitution of European\r\nsociety we are struck at once with the fact that, although so much has\r\nbeen done to get rid of the village community, this form of union\r\ncontinues to exist to the extent we shall presently see, and that many\r\nattempts are now made either to reconstitute it in some shape or another\r\nor to find some substitute for it. The current theory as regards the\r\nvillage community is, that in Western Europe it has died out by a\r\nnatural death, because the communal possession of the soil was found\r\ninconsistent with the modern requirements of agriculture. But the truth\r\nis that nowhere did the village community disappear of its own accord;\r\neverywhere, on the contrary, it took the ruling classes several\r\ncenturies of persistent but not always successful efforts to abolish it\r\nand to confiscate the communal lands.\r\n\r\nIn France, the village communities began to be deprived of their\r\nindependence, and their lands began to be plundered, as early as the\r\nsixteenth century. However, it was only in the next century, when the\r\nmass of the peasants was brought, by exactions and wars, to the state of\r\nsubjection and misery which is vividly depicted by all historians, that\r\nthe plundering of their lands became easy and attained scandalous\r\nproportions. \"Every one has taken of them according to his powers ...\r\nimaginary debts have been claimed, in order to seize upon their lands;\"\r\nso we read in an edict promulgated by Louis the Fourteenth in 1667.(3)\r\nOf course the State's remedy for such evils was to render the communes\r\nstill more subservient to the State, and to plunder them itself. In\r\nfact, two years later all money revenue of the communes was confiscated\r\nby the King. As to the appropriation of communal lands, it grew worse\r\nand worse, and in the next century the nobles and the clergy had already\r\ntaken possession of immense tracts of land--one-half of the cultivated\r\narea, according to certain estimates--mostly to let it go out of\r\nculture.(4) But the peasants still maintained their communal\r\ninstitutions, and until the year 1787 the village folkmotes, composed of\r\nall householders, used to come together in the shadow of the bell-tower\r\nor a tree, to allot and re-allot what they had retained of their fields,\r\nto assess the taxes, and to elect their executive, just as the Russian\r\nmir does at the present time. This is what Babeau's researches have\r\nproved to demonstration.(5)\r\n\r\nThe Government found, however, the folkmotes \"too noisy,\" too\r\ndisobedient, and in 1787, elected councils, composed of a mayor and\r\nthree to six syndics, chosen from among the wealthier peasants, were\r\nintroduced instead. Two years later the Revolutionary Assemblee\r\nConstituante, which was on this point at one with the old regime, fully\r\nconfirmed this law (on the 14th of December, 1789), and the bourgeois du\r\nvillage had now their turn for the plunder of communal lands, which\r\ncontinued all through the Revolutionary period. Only on the 16th of\r\nAugust, 1792, the Convention, under the pressure of the peasants'\r\ninsurrections, decided to return the enclosed lands to the communes;(6)\r\nbut it ordered at the same time that they should be divided in equal\r\nparts among the wealthier peasants only--a measure which provoked new\r\ninsurrections and was abrogated next year, in 1793, when the order came\r\nto divide the communal lands among all commoners, rich and poor alike,\r\n\"active\" and \"inactive.\"\r\n\r\nThese two laws, however, ran so much against the conceptions of the\r\npeasants that they were not obeyed, and wherever the peasants had\r\nretaken possession of part of their lands they kept them undivided. But\r\nthen came the long years of wars, and the communal lands were simply\r\nconfiscated by the State (in 1794) as a mortgage for State loans, put up\r\nfor sale, and plundered as such; then returned again to the communes and\r\nconfiscated again (in 1813); and only in 1816 what remained of them,\r\ni.e. about 15,000,000 acres of the least productive land, was restored\r\nto the village communities.(7) Still this was not yet the end of the\r\ntroubles of the communes. Every new regime saw in the communal lands a\r\nmeans for gratifying its supporters, and three laws (the first in 1837\r\nand the last under Napoleon the Third) were passed to induce the village\r\ncommunities to divide their estates. Three times these laws had to be\r\nrepealed, in consequence of the opposition they met with in the\r\nvillages; but something was snapped up each time, and Napoleon the\r\nThird, under the pretext of encouraging perfected methods of\r\nagriculture, granted large estates out of the communal lands to some of\r\nhis favourites.\r\n\r\nAs to the autonomy of the village communities, what could be retained of\r\nit after so many blows? The mayor and the syndics were simply looked\r\nupon as unpaid functionaries of the State machinery. Even now, under the\r\nThird Republic, very little can be done in a village community without\r\nthe huge State machinery, up to the prefet and the ministries, being set\r\nin motion. It is hardly credible, and yet it is true, that when, for\r\ninstance, a peasant intends to pay in money his share in the repair of a\r\ncommunal road, instead of himself breaking the necessary amount of\r\nstones, no fewer than twelve different functionaries of the State must\r\ngive their approval, and an aggregate of fifty-two different acts must\r\nbe performed by them, and exchanged between them, before the peasant is\r\npermitted to pay that money to the communal council. All the remainder\r\nbears the same character.(8)\r\n\r\nWhat took place in France took place everywhere in Western and Middle\r\nEurope. Even the chief dates of the great assaults upon the peasant\r\nlands are the same. For England the only difference is that the\r\nspoliation was accomplished by separate acts rather than by general\r\nsweeping measures--with less haste but more thoroughly than in France.\r\nThe seizure of the communal lands by the lords also began in the\r\nfifteenth century, after the defeat of the peasant insurrection of\r\n1380--as seen from Rossus's Historia and from a statute of Henry the\r\nSeventh, in which these seizures are spoken of under the heading of\r\n\"enormitees and myschefes as be hurtfull ... to the common wele.\"(9)\r\nLater on the Great Inquest, under Henry the Eighth, was begun, as is\r\nknown, in order to put a stop to the enclosure of communal lands, but it\r\nended in a sanction of what had been done.(10) The communal lands\r\ncontinued to be preyed upon, and the peasants were driven from the land.\r\nBut it was especially since the middle of the eighteenth century that,\r\nin England as everywhere else, it became part of a systematic policy to\r\nsimply weed out all traces of communal ownership; and the wonder is not\r\nthat it has disappeared, but that it could be maintained, even in\r\nEngland, so as to be \"generally prevalent so late as the grandfathers of\r\nthis generation.\"(11) The very object of the Enclosure Acts, as shown by\r\nMr. Seebohm, was to remove this system,(12) and it was so well removed\r\nby the nearly four thousand Acts passed between 1760 and 1844 that only\r\nfaint traces of it remain now. The land of the village communities was\r\ntaken by the lords, and the appropriation was sanctioned by Parliament\r\nin each separate case.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, in Austria, in Belgium the village community was also\r\ndestroyed by the State. Instances of commoners themselves dividing their\r\nlands were rare,(13) while everywhere the States coerced them to enforce\r\nthe division, or simply favoured the private appropriation of their\r\nlands. The last blow to communal ownership in Middle Europe also dates\r\nfrom the middle of the eighteenth century. In Austria sheer force was\r\nused by the Government, in 1768, to compel the communes to divide their\r\nlands--a special commission being nominated two years later for that\r\npurpose. In Prussia Frederick the Second, in several of his ordinances\r\n(in 1752, 1763, 1765, and 1769), recommended to the Justizcollegien to\r\nenforce the division. In Silesia a special resolution was issued to\r\nserve that aim in 1771. The same took place in Belgium, and, as the\r\ncommunes did not obey, a law was issued in 1847 empowering the\r\nGovernment to buy communal meadows in order to sell them in retail, and\r\nto make a forced sale of the communal land when there was a would-be\r\nbuyer for it.(14)\r\n\r\nIn short, to speak of the natural death of the village communities in\r\nvirtue of economical laws is as grim a joke as to speak of the natural\r\ndeath of soldiers slaughtered on a battlefield. The fact was simply\r\nthis: The village communities had lived for over a thousand years; and\r\nwhere and when the peasants were not ruined by wars and exactions they\r\nsteadily improved their methods of culture. But as the value of land was\r\nincreasing, in consequence of the growth of industries, and the nobility\r\nhad acquired, under the State organization, a power which it never had\r\nhad under the feudal system, it took possession of the best parts of the\r\ncommunal lands, and did its best to destroy the communal institutions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the village-community institutions so well respond to the needs\r\nand conceptions of the tillers of the soil that, in spite of all, Europe\r\nis up to this date covered with living survivals of the village\r\ncommunities, and European country life is permeated with customs and\r\nhabits dating from the community period. Even in England,\r\nnotwithstanding all the drastic measures taken against the old order of\r\nthings, it prevailed as late as the beginning of the nineteenth century.\r\nMr. Gomme--one of the very few English scholars who have paid attention\r\nto the subject--shows in his work that many traces of the communal\r\npossession of the soil are found in Scotland, \"runrig\" tenancy having\r\nbeen maintained in Forfarshire up to 1813, while in certain villages of\r\nInverness the custom was, up to 1801, to plough the land for the whole\r\ncommunity, without leaving any boundaries, and to allot it after the\r\nploughing was done. In Kilmorie the allotment and re-allotment of the\r\nfields was in full vigour \"till the last twenty-five years,\" and the\r\nCrofters' Commission found it still in vigour in certain islands.(15) In\r\nIreland the system prevailed up to the great famine; and as to England,\r\nMarshall's works, which passed unnoticed until Nasse and Sir Henry Maine\r\ndrew attention to them, leave no doubt as to the village-community\r\nsystem having been widely spread, in nearly all English counties, at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century.(16) No more than twenty years ago\r\nSir Henry Maine was \"greatly surprised at the number of instances of\r\nabnormal property rights, necessarily implying the former existence of\r\ncollective ownership and joint cultivation,\" which a comparatively brief\r\ninquiry brought under his notice.(17) And, communal institutions having\r\npersisted so late as that, a great number of mutual-aid habits and\r\ncustoms would undoubtedly be discovered in English villages if the\r\nwriters of this country only paid attention to village life.(18)\r\n\r\nAs to the Continent, we find the communal institutions fully alive in\r\nmany parts of France, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, the Scandinavian\r\nlands, and Spain, to say nothing of Eastern Europe; the village life in\r\nthese countries is permeated with communal habits and customs; and\r\nalmost every year the Continental literature is enriched by serious\r\nworks dealing with this and connected subjects. I must, therefore, limit\r\nmy illustrations to the most typical instances. Switzerland is\r\nundoubtedly one of them. Not only the five republics of Uri, Schwytz,\r\nAppenzell, Glarus, and Unterwalden hold their lands as undivided\r\nestates, and are governed by their popular folkmotes, but in all other\r\ncantons too the village communities remain in possession of a wide\r\nself-government, and own large parts of the Federal territory.(19)\r\nTwo-thirds of all the Alpine meadows and two-thirds of all the forests\r\nof Switzerland are until now communal land; and a considerable number of\r\nfields, orchards, vineyards, peat bogs, quarries, and so on, are owned\r\nin common. In the Vaud, where all the householders continue to take part\r\nin the deliberations of their elected communal councils, the communal\r\nspirit is especially alive. Towards the end of the winter all the young\r\nmen of each village go to stay a few days in the woods, to fell timber\r\nand to bring it down the steep slopes tobogganing way, the timber and\r\nthe fuel wood being divided among all households or sold for their\r\nbenefit. These excursions are real fetes of manly labour. On the banks\r\nof Lake Leman part of the work required to keep up the terraces of the\r\nvineyards is still done in common; and in the spring, when the\r\nthermometer threatens to fall below zero before sunrise, the watchman\r\nwakes up all householders, who light fires of straw and dung and protect\r\ntheir vine-trees from the frost by an artificial cloud. In nearly all\r\ncantons the village communities possess so-called. Burgernutzen--that\r\nis, they hold in common a number of cows, in order to supply each family\r\nwith butter; or they keep communal fields or vineyards, of which the\r\nproduce is divided between the burghers, or they rent their land for the\r\nbenefit of the community.(20)\r\n\r\nIt may be taken as a rule that where the communes have retained a wide\r\nsphere of functions, so as to be living parts of the national organism,\r\nand where they have not been reduced to sheer misery, they never fail to\r\ntake good care of their lands. Accordingly the communal estates in\r\nSwitzerland strikingly contrast with the miserable state of \"commons\" in\r\nthis country. The communal forests in the Vaud and the Valais are\r\nadmirably managed, in conformity with the rules of modern forestry.\r\nElsewhere the \"strips\" of communal fields, which change owners under the\r\nsystem of re-allotment, are very well manured, especially as there is no\r\nlack of meadows and cattle. The high level meadows are well kept as a\r\nrule, and the rural roads are excellent.(21) And when we admire the\r\nSwiss chalet, the mountain road, the peasants' cattle, the terraces of\r\nvineyards, or the school-house in Switzer land, we must keep in mind\r\nthat without the timber for the chalet being taken from the communal\r\nwoods and the stone from the communal quarries, without the cows being\r\nkept on the communal meadows, and the roads being made and the\r\nschool-houses built by communal work, there would be little to admire.\r\n\r\nIt hardly need be said that a great number of mutual-aid habits and\r\ncustoms continue to persist in the Swiss villages. The evening\r\ngatherings for shelling walnuts, which take place in turns in each\r\nhousehold; the evening parties for sewing the dowry of the girl who is\r\ngoing to marry; the calling of \"aids\" for building the houses and taking\r\nin the crops, as well as for all sorts of work which may be required by\r\none of the commoners; the custom of exchanging children from one canton\r\nto the other, in order to make them learn two languages, French and\r\nGerman; and so on--all these are quite habitual;(22) while, on the other\r\nside, divers modern requirements are met in the same spirit. Thus in\r\nGlarus most of the Alpine meadows have been sold during a time of\r\ncalamity; but the communes still continue to buy field land, and after\r\nthe newly-bought fields have been left in the possession of separate\r\ncommoners for ten, twenty, or thirty years, as the case might be, they\r\nreturn to the common stock, which is re-allotted according to the needs\r\nof all. A great number of small associations are formed to produce some\r\nof the necessaries for life--bread, cheese, and wine--by common work, be\r\nit only on a limited scale; and agricultural co-operation altogether\r\nspreads in Switzerland with the greatest ease. Associations formed\r\nbetween ten to thirty peasants, who buy meadows and fields in common,\r\nand cultivate them as co-owners, are of common occurrence; while dairy\r\nassociations for the sale of milk, butter, and cheese are organized\r\neverywhere. In fact, Switzerland was the birthplace of that form of\r\nco-operation. It offers, moreover, an immense field for the study of all\r\nsorts of small and large societies, formed for the satisfaction of all\r\nsorts of modern wants. In certain parts of Switzerland one finds in\r\nalmost every village a number of associations--for protection from fire,\r\nfor boating, for maintaining the quays on the shores of a lake, for the\r\nsupply of water, and so on; and the country is covered with societies of\r\narchers, sharpshooters, topographers, footpath explorers, and the like,\r\noriginated from modern militarism.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland is, however, by no means an exception in Europe, because the\r\nsame institutions and habits are found in the villages of France, of\r\nItaly, of Germany, of Denmark, and so on. We have just seen what has\r\nbeen done by the rulers of France in order to destroy the village\r\ncommunity and to get hold of its lands; but notwithstanding all that\r\none-tenth part of the whole territory available for culture, i.e.\r\n13,500,000 acres, including one-half of all the natural meadows and\r\nnearly a fifth part of all the forests of the country, remain in\r\ncommunal possession. The woods supply the communers with fuel, and the\r\ntimber wood is cut, mostly by communal work, with all desirable\r\nregularity; the grazing lands are free for the commoners' cattle; and\r\nwhat remains of communal fields is allotted and re-allotted in certain\r\nparts Ardennes--in the usual of France--namely, in the way.(23)\r\n\r\nThese additional sources of supply, which aid the poorer peasants to\r\npass through a year of bad crops without parting with their small plots\r\nof land and without running into irredeemable debts, have certainly\r\ntheir importance for both the agricultural labourers and the nearly\r\nthree millions of small peasant proprietors. It is even doubtful whether\r\nsmall peasant proprietorship could be maintained without these\r\nadditional resources. But the ethical importance of the communal\r\npossessions, small as they are, is still greater than their economical\r\nvalue. They maintain in village life a nucleus of customs and habits of\r\nmutual aid which undoubtedly acts as a mighty check upon the development\r\nof reckless individualism and greediness, which small land-ownership is\r\nonly too prone to develop. Mutual aid in all possible circumstances of\r\nvillage life is part of the routine life in all parts of the country.\r\nEverywhere we meet, under different names, with the charroi, i.e. the\r\nfree aid of the neighbours for taking in a crop, for vintage, or for\r\nbuilding a house; everywhere we find the same evening gatherings as have\r\njust been mentioned in Switzerland; and everywhere the commoners\r\nassociate for all sorts of work. Such habits are mentioned by nearly all\r\nthose who have written upon French village life. But it will perhaps be\r\nbetter to give in this place some abstracts from letters which I have\r\njust received from a friend of mine whom I have asked to communicate to\r\nme his observations on this subject. They come from an aged man who for\r\nyears has been the mayor of his commune in South France (in Ariege); the\r\nfacts he mentions are known to him from long years of personal\r\nobservation, and they have the advantage of coming from one\r\nneighbourhood instead of being skimmed from a large area. Some of them\r\nmay seem trifling, but as a whole they depict quite a little world of\r\nvillage life.\r\n\r\n\"In several communes in our neighbourhood,\" my friend writes, \"the old\r\ncustom of l'emprount is in vigour. When many hands are required in a\r\nmetairie for rapidly making some work--dig out potatoes or mow the\r\ngrass--the youth of the neighbourhood is convoked; young men and girls\r\ncome in numbers, make it gaily and for nothing; and in the evening,\r\nafter a gay meal, they dance.\r\n\r\n\"In the same communes, when a girl is going to marry, the girls of the\r\nneighbourhood come to aid in sewing the dowry. In several communes the\r\nwomen still continue to spin a good deal. When the winding off has to be\r\ndone in a family it is done in one evening--all friends being convoked\r\nfor that work. In many communes of the Ariege and other parts of the\r\nsouth-west the shelling of the Indian corn-sheaves is also done by all\r\nthe neighbours. They are treated with chestnuts and wine, and the young\r\npeople dance after the work has been done. The same custom is practised\r\nfor making nut oil and crushing hemp. In the commune of L. the same is\r\ndone for bringing in the corn crops. These days of hard work become fete\r\ndays, as the owner stakes his honour on serving a good meal. No\r\nremuneration is given; all do it for each other.(24)\r\n\r\n\"In the commune of S. the common grazing-land is every year increased,\r\nso that nearly the whole of the land of the commune is now kept in\r\ncommon. The shepherds are elected by all owners of the cattle, including\r\nwomen. The bulls are communal.\r\n\r\n\"In the commune of M. the forty to fifty small sheep flocks of the\r\ncommoners are brought together and divided into three or four flocks\r\nbefore being sent to the higher meadows. Each owner goes for a week to\r\nserve as shepherd.\r\n\r\n\"In the hamlet of C. a threshing machine has been bought in common by\r\nseveral households; the fifteen to twenty persons required to serve the\r\nmachine being supplied by all the families. Three other threshing\r\nmachines have been bought and are rented out by their owners, but the\r\nwork is performed by outside helpers, invited in the usual way.\r\n\r\n\"In our commune of R. we had to raise the wall of the cemetery. Half of\r\nthe money which was required for buying lime and for the wages of the\r\nskilled workers was supplied by the county council, and the other half\r\nby subscription. As to the work of carrying sand and water, making\r\nmortar, and serving the masons, it was done entirely by volunteers [just\r\nas in the Kabyle djemmaa]. The rural roads were repaired in the same\r\nway, by volunteer days of work given by the commoners. Other communes\r\nhave built in the same way their fountains. The wine-press and other\r\nsmaller appliances are frequently kept by the commune.\"\r\n\r\nTwo residents of the same neighbourhood, questioned by my friend, add\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n\"At O. a few years ago there was no mill. The commune has built one,\r\nlevying a tax upon the commoners. As to the miller, they decided, in\r\norder to avoid frauds and partiality, that he should be paid two francs\r\nfor each bread-eater, and the corn be ground free.\r\n\r\n\"At St. G. few peasants are insured against fire. When a conflagration\r\nhas taken place--so it was lately--all give something to the family\r\nwhich has suffered from it--a chaldron, a bed-cloth, a chair, and so\r\non--and a modest household is thus reconstituted. All the neighbours aid\r\nto build the house, and in the meantime the family is lodged free by the\r\nneighbours.\"\r\n\r\nSuch habits of mutual support--of which many more examples could be\r\ngiven--undoubtedly account for the easiness with which the French\r\npeasants associate for using, in turn, the plough with its team of\r\nhorses, the wine-press, and the threshing machine, when they are kept in\r\nthe village by one of them only, as well as for the performance of all\r\nsorts of rural work in common. Canals were maintained, forests were\r\ncleared, trees were planted, and marshes were drained by the village\r\ncommunities from time immemorial; and the same continues still. Quite\r\nlately, in La Borne of Lozere barren hills were turned into rich gardens\r\nby communal work. \"The soil was brought on men's backs; terraces were\r\nmade and planted with chestnut trees, peach trees, and orchards, and\r\nwater was brought for irrigation in canals two or three miles long.\"\r\nJust now they have dug a new canal, eleven miles in length.(25)\r\n\r\nTo the same spirit is also due the remarkable success lately obtained by\r\nthe syndicats agricoles, or peasants' and farmers' associations. It was\r\nnot until 1884 that associations of more than nineteen persons were\r\npermitted in France, and I need not say that when this \"dangerous\r\nexperiment\" was ventured upon--so it was styled in the Chambers--all due\r\n\"precautions\" which functionaries can invent were taken. Notwithstanding\r\nall that, France begins to be covered with syndicates. At the outset\r\nthey were only formed for buying manures and seeds, falsification having\r\nattained colossal proportions in these two branches;(26) but gradually\r\nthey extended their functions in various directions, including the sale\r\nof agricultural produce and permanent improvements of the land. In South\r\nFrance the ravages of the phylloxera have called into existence a great\r\nnumber of wine-growers' associations. Ten to thirty growers form a\r\nsyndicate, buy a steam-engine for pumping water, and make the necessary\r\narrangements for inundating their vineyards in turn.(27) New\r\nassociations for protecting the land from inundations, for irrigation\r\npurposes, and for maintaining canals are continually formed, and the\r\nunanimity of all peasants of a neighbourhood, which is required by law,\r\nis no obstacle. Elsewhere we have the fruitieres, or dairy associations,\r\nin some of which all butter and cheese is divided in equal parts,\r\nirrespective of the yield of each cow. In the Ariege we find an\r\nassociation of eight separate communes for the common culture of their\r\nlands, which they have put together; syndicates for free medical aid\r\nhave been formed in 172 communes out of 337 in the same department;\r\nassociations of consumers arise in connection with the syndicates; and\r\nso on.(28) \"Quite a revolution is going on in our villages,\" Alfred\r\nBaudrillart writes, \"through these associations, which take in each\r\nregion their own special characters.\"\r\n\r\nVery much the same must be said of Germany. Wherever the peasants could\r\nresist the plunder of their lands, they have retained them in communal\r\nownership, which largely prevails in Wurttemberg, Baden, Hohenzollern,\r\nand in the Hessian province of Starkenberg.(29) The communal forests are\r\nkept, as a rule, in an excellent state, and in thousands of communes\r\ntimber and fuel wood are divided every year among all inhabitants; even\r\nthe old custom of the Lesholztag is widely spread: at the ringing of the\r\nvillage bell all go to the forest to take as much fuel wood as they can\r\ncarry.(30) In Westphalia one finds communes in which all the land is\r\ncultivated as one common estate, in accordance with all requirements of\r\nmodern agronomy. As to the old communal customs and habits, they are in\r\nvigour in most parts of Germany. The calling in of aids, which are real\r\nfetes of labour, is known to be quite habitual in Westphalia, Hesse, and\r\nNassau. In well-timbered regions the timber for a new house is usually\r\ntaken from the communal forest, and all the neighbours join in building\r\nthe house. Even in the suburbs of Frankfort it is a regular custom among\r\nthe gardeners that in case of one of them being ill all come on Sunday\r\nto cultivate his garden.(31)\r\n\r\nIn Germany, as in France, as soon as the rulers of the people repealed\r\ntheir laws against the peasant associations--that was only in\r\n1884-1888--these unions began to develop with a wonderful rapidity,\r\nnotwithstanding all legal obstacles which were put in their way(32) \"It\r\nis a fact,\" Buchenberger says, \"that in thousands of village\r\ncommunities, in which no sort of chemical manure or rational fodder was\r\never known, both have become of everyday use, to a quite unforeseen\r\nextent, owing to these associations\" (vol. ii. p. 507). All sorts of\r\nlabour-saving implements and agricultural machinery, and better breeds\r\nof cattle, are bought through the associations, and various arrangements\r\nfor improving the quality of the produce begin to be introduced. Unions\r\nfor the sale of agricultural produce are also formed, as well as for\r\npermanent improvements of the land.(33)\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of social economics all these efforts of the\r\npeasants certainly are of little importance. They cannot substantially,\r\nand still less permanently, alleviate the misery to which the tillers of\r\nthe soil are doomed all over Europe. But from the ethical point of view,\r\nwhich we are now considering, their importance cannot be overrated. They\r\nprove that even under the system of reckless individualism which now\r\nprevails the agricultural masses piously maintain their mutual-support\r\ninheritance; and as soon as the States relax the iron laws by means of\r\nwhich they have broken all bonds between men, these bonds are at once\r\nreconstituted, notwithstanding the difficulties, political, economical,\r\nand social, which are many, and in such forms as best answer to the\r\nmodern requirements of production. They indicate in which direction and\r\nin which form further progress must be expected.\r\n\r\nI might easily multiply such illustrations, taking them from Italy,\r\nSpain, Denmark, and so on, and pointing out some interesting features\r\nwhich are proper to each of these countries. The Slavonian populations\r\nof Austria and the Balkan peninsula, among whom the \"compound family,\"\r\nor \"undivided household,\" is found in existence, ought also to be\r\nmentioned.(34) But I hasten to pass on to Russia, where the same\r\nmutual-support tendency takes certain new and unforeseen forms.\r\nMoreover, in dealing with the village community in Russia we have the\r\nadvantage: of possessing an immense mass of materials, collected during\r\nthe colossal house-to-house inquest which was lately made by several\r\nzemstvos (county councils), and which embraces a population of nearly\r\n20,000,000 peasants in different parts of the country.(35)\r\n\r\nTwo important conclusions may be drawn from the bulk of evidence\r\ncollected by the Russian inquests. In Middle Russia, where fully\r\none-third of the peasants have been brought to utter ruin (by heavy\r\ntaxation, small allotments of unproductive land, rack rents, and very\r\nsevere tax-collecting after total failures of crops), there was, during\r\nthe first five-and-twenty years after the emancipation of the serfs, a\r\ndecided tendency towards the constitution of individual property in land\r\nwithin the village communities. Many impoverished \"horseless\" peasants\r\nabandoned their allotments, and this land often became the property of\r\nthose richer peasants, who borrow additional incomes from trade, or of\r\noutside traders, who buy land chiefly for exacting rack rents from the\r\npeasants. It must also be added that a flaw in the land redemption law\r\nof 1861 offered great facilities for buying peasants' lands at a very\r\nsmall expense,(36) and that the State officials mostly used their\r\nweighty influence in favour of individual as against communal ownership.\r\nHowever, for the last twenty years a strong wind of opposition to the\r\nindividual appropriation of the land blows again through the Middle\r\nRussian villages, and strenuous efforts are being made by the bulk of\r\nthose peasants who stand between the rich and the very poor to uphold\r\nthe village community. As to the fertile steppes of the South, which are\r\nnow the most populous and the richest part of European Russia, they were\r\nmostly colonized, during the present century, under the system of\r\nindividual ownership or occupation, sanctioned in that form by the\r\nState. But since improved methods of agriculture with the aid of\r\nmachinery have been introduced in the region, the peasant owners have\r\ngradually begun themselves to transform their individual ownership into\r\ncommunal possession, and one finds now, in that granary of Russia, a\r\nvery great number of spontaneously formed village communities of recent\r\norigin.(37)\r\n\r\nThe Crimea and the part of the mainland which lies to the north of it\r\n(the province of Taurida), for which we have detailed data, offer an\r\nexcellent illustration of that movement. This territory began to be\r\ncolonized, after its annexation in 1783, by Great, Little, and White\r\nRussians--Cossacks, freemen, and runaway serfs--who came individually or\r\nin small groups from all corners of Russia. They took first to\r\ncattle-breeding, and when they began later on to till the soil, each one\r\ntilled as much as he could afford to. But when--immigration continuing,\r\nand perfected ploughs being introduced--land stood in great demand,\r\nbitter disputes arose among the settlers. They lasted for years, until\r\nthese men, previously tied by no mutual bonds, gradually came to the\r\nidea that an end must be put to disputes by introducing\r\nvillage-community ownership. They passed decisions to the effect that\r\nthe land which they owned individually should henceforward be their\r\ncommon property, and they began to allot and to re-allot it in\r\naccordance with the usual village-community rules. The movement\r\ngradually took a great extension, and on a small territory, the Taurida\r\nstatisticians found 161 villages in which communal ownership had been\r\nintroduced by the peasant proprietors themselves, chiefly in the years\r\n1855-1885, in lieu of individual ownership. Quite a variety of\r\nvillage-community types has been freely worked out in this way by the\r\nsettlers.(38) What adds to the interest of this transformation is that\r\nit took place, not only among the Great Russians, who are used to\r\nvillage-community life, but also among Little Russians, who have long\r\nsince forgotten it under Polish rule, among Greeks and Bulgarians, and\r\neven among Germans, who have long since worked out in their prosperous\r\nand half-industrial Volga colonies their own type of village\r\ncommunity.(39) It is evident that the Mussulman Tartars of Taurida hold\r\ntheir land under the Mussulman customary law, which is limited personal\r\noccupation; but even with them the European village community has been\r\nintroduced in a few cases. As to other nationalities in Taurida,\r\nindividual ownership has been abolished in six Esthonian, two Greek, two\r\nBulgarian, one Czech, and one German village. This movement is\r\ncharacteristic for the whole of the fertile steppe region of the south.\r\nBut separate instances of it are also found in Little Russia. Thus in a\r\nnumber of villages of the province of Chernigov the peasants were\r\nformerly individual owners of their plots; they had separate legal\r\ndocuments for their plots and used to rent and to sell their land at\r\nwill. But in the fifties of the nineteenth century a movement began\r\namong them in favour of communal possession, the chief argument being\r\nthe growing number of pauper families. The initiative of the reform was\r\ntaken in one village, and the others followed suit, the last case on\r\nrecord dating from 1882. Of course there were struggles between the\r\npoor, who usually claim for communal possession, and the rich, who\r\nusually prefer individual ownership; and the struggles often lasted for\r\nyears. In certain places the unanimity required then by the law being\r\nimpossible to obtain, the village divided into two villages, one under\r\nindividual ownership and the other under communal possession; and so\r\nthey remained until the two coalesced into one community, or else they\r\nremained divided still. As to Middle Russia, its a fact that in many\r\nvillages which were drifting towards individual ownership there began\r\nsince 1880 a mass movement in favour of re-establishing the village\r\ncommunity. Even peasant proprietors who had lived for years under the\r\nindividualist system returned en masse to the communal institutions.\r\nThus, there is a considerable number of ex-serfs who have received\r\none-fourth part only of the regulation allotments, but they have\r\nreceived them free of redemption and in individual ownership. There was\r\nin 1890 a wide-spread movement among them (in Kursk, Ryazan, Tambov,\r\nOrel, etc.) towards putting their allotments together and introducing\r\nthe village community. The \"free agriculturists\" (volnyie\r\nkhlebopashtsy), who were liberated from serfdom under the law of 1803,\r\nand had bought their allotments--each family separately--are now nearly\r\nall under the village-community system, which they have introduced\r\nthemselves. All these movements are of recent origin, and non-Russians\r\ntoo join them. Thus the Bulgares in the district of Tiraspol, after\r\nhaving remained for sixty years under the personal-property system,\r\nintroduced the village community in the years 1876-1882. The German\r\nMennonites of Berdyansk fought in 1890 for introducing the village\r\ncommunity, and the small peasant proprietors (Kleinwirthschaftliche)\r\namong the German Baptists were agitating in their villages in the same\r\ndirection. One instance more: In the province of Samara the Russian\r\ngovernment created in the forties, by way of experiment, 103 villages on\r\nthe system of individual ownership. Each household received a splendid\r\nproperty of 105 acres. In 1890, out of the 103 villages the peasants in\r\n72 had already notified the desire of introducing the village community.\r\nI take all these facts from the excellent work of V.V., who simply\r\ngives, in a classified form, the facts recorded in the above-mentioned\r\nhouse-to-house inquest.\r\n\r\nThis movement in favour of communal possession runs badly against the\r\ncurrent economical theories, according to which intensive culture is\r\nincompatible with the village community. But the most charitable thing\r\nthat can be said of these theories is that they have never been\r\nsubmitted to the test of experiment: they belong to the domain of\r\npolitical metaphysics. The facts which we have before us show, on the\r\ncontrary, that wherever the Russian peasants, owing to a concurrence of\r\nfavourable circumstances, are less miserable than they are on the\r\naverage, and wherever they find men of knowledge and initiative among\r\ntheir neighbours, the village community becomes the very means for\r\nintroducing various improvements in agriculture and village life\r\naltogether. Here, as elsewhere, mutual aid is a better leader to\r\nprogress than the war of each against all, as may be seen from the\r\nfollowing facts.\r\n\r\nUnder Nicholas the First's rule many Crown officials and serf-owners\r\nused to compel the peasants to introduce the communal culture of small\r\nplots of the village lands, in order to refill the communal storehouses\r\nafter loans of grain had been granted to the poorest commoners. Such\r\ncultures, connected in the peasants' minds with the worst reminiscences\r\nof serfdom, were abandoned as soon as serfdom was abolished but now the\r\npeasants begin to reintroduce them on their own account. In one district\r\n(Ostrogozhsk, in Kursk) the initiative of one person was sufficient to\r\ncall them to life in four-fifths of all the villages. The same is met\r\nwith in several other localities. On a given day the commoners come out,\r\nthe richer ones with a plough or a cart and the poorer ones\r\nsingle-handed, and no attempt is made to discriminate one's share in the\r\nwork. The crop is afterwards used for loans to the poorer commoners,\r\nmostly free grants, or for the orphans and widows, or for the village\r\nchurch, or for the school, or for repaying a communal debt.(40)\r\n\r\nThat all sorts of work which enters, so to say, in the routine of\r\nvillage life (repair of roads and bridges, dams, drainage, supply of\r\nwater for irrigation, cutting of wood, planting of trees, etc.) are made\r\nby whole communes, and that land is rented and meadows are mown by whole\r\ncommunes--the work being accomplished by old and young, men and women,\r\nin the way described by Tolstoi--is only what one may expect from people\r\nliving under the village-community system.(41) They are of everyday\r\noccurrence all over the country. But the village community is also by no\r\nmeans averse to modern agricultural improvements, when it can stand the\r\nexpense, and when knowledge, hitherto kept for the rich only, finds its\r\nway into the peasant's house.\r\n\r\nIt has just been said that perfected ploughs rapidly spread in South\r\nRussia, and in many cases the village communities were instrumental in\r\nspreading their use. A plough was bought by the community, experimented\r\nupon on a portion of the communal land, and the necessary improvements\r\nwere indicated to the makers, whom the communes often aided in starting\r\nthe manufacture of cheap ploughs as a village industry. In the district\r\nof Moscow, where 1,560 ploughs were lately bought by the peasants during\r\nfive years, the impulse came from those communes which rented lands as a\r\nbody for the special purpose of improved culture.\r\n\r\nIn the north-east (Vyatka) small associations of peasants, who travel\r\nwith their winnowing machines (manufactured as a village industry in one\r\nof the iron districts), have spread the use of such machines in the\r\nneighbouring governments. The very wide spread of threshing machines in\r\nSamara, Saratov, and Kherson is due to the peasant associations, which\r\ncan afford to buy a costly engine, while the individual peasant cannot.\r\nAnd while we read in nearly all economical treatises that the village\r\ncommunity was doomed to disappear when the three-fields system had to be\r\nsubstituted by the rotation of crops system, we see in Russia many\r\nvillage communities taking the initiative of introducing the rotation of\r\ncrops. Before accepting it the peasants usually set apart a portion of\r\nthe communal fields for an experiment in artificial meadows, and the\r\ncommune buys the seeds.(42) If the experiment proves successful they\r\nfind no difficulty whatever in re-dividing their fields, so as to suit\r\nthe five or six fields system.\r\n\r\nThis system is now in use in hundreds of villages of Moscow, Tver,\r\nSmolensk, Vyatka, and Pskov.(43) And where land can be spared the\r\ncommunities give also a portion of their domain to allotments for\r\nfruit-growing. Finally, the sudden extension lately taken in Russia by\r\nthe little model farms, orchards, kitchen gardens, and silkworm-culture\r\ngrounds--which are started at the village school-houses, under the\r\nconduct of the school-master, or of a village volunteer--is also due to\r\nthe support they found with the village communities.\r\n\r\nMoreover, such permanent improvements as drainage and irrigation are of\r\nfrequent occurrence. For instance, in three districts of the province of\r\nMoscow--industrial to a great extent--drainage works have been\r\naccomplished within the last ten years on a large scale in no less than\r\n180 to 200 different villages--the commoners working themselves with the\r\nspade. At another extremity of Russia, in the dry Steppes of Novouzen,\r\nover a thousand dams for ponds were built and several hundreds of deep\r\nwells were sunk by the communes; while in a wealthy German colony of the\r\nsouth-east the commoners worked, men and women alike, for five weeks in\r\nsuccession, to erect a dam, two miles long, for irrigation purposes.\r\nWhat could isolated men do in that struggle against the dry climate?\r\nWhat could they obtain through individual effort when South Russia was\r\nstruck with the marmot plague, and all people living on the land, rich\r\nand poor, commoners and individualists, had to work with their hands in\r\norder to conjure the plague? To call in the policeman would have been of\r\nno use; to associate was the only possible remedy.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after having said so much about mutual aid and support which\r\nare practised by the tillers of the soil in \"civilized\" countries, I see\r\nthat I might fill an octavo volume with illustrations taken from the\r\nlife of the hundreds of millions of men who also live under the\r\ntutorship of more or less centralized States, but are out of touch with\r\nmodern civilization and modern ideas. I might describe the inner life of\r\na Turkish village and its network of admirable mutual-aid customs and\r\nhabits. On turning over my leaflets covered with illustrations from\r\npeasant life in Caucasia, I come across touching facts of mutual\r\nsupport. I trace the same customs in the Arab djemmaa and the Afghan\r\npurra, in the villages of Persia, India, and Java, in the undivided\r\nfamily of the Chinese, in the encampments of the semi-nomads of Central\r\nAsia and the nomads of the far North. On consulting notes taken at\r\nrandom in the literature of Africa, I find them replete with similar\r\nfacts--of aids convoked to take in the crops, of houses built by all\r\ninhabitants of the village--sometimes to repair the havoc done by\r\ncivilized filibusters--of people aiding each other in case of accident,\r\nprotecting the traveller, and so on. And when I peruse such works as\r\nPost's compendium of African customary law I understand why,\r\nnotwithstanding all tyranny, oppression, robberies and raids, tribal\r\nwars, glutton kings, deceiving witches and priests, slave-hunters, and\r\nthe like, these populations have not gone astray in the woods; why they\r\nhave maintained a certain civilization, and have remained men, instead\r\nof dropping to the level of straggling families of decaying\r\norang-outans. The fact is, that the slave-hunters, the ivory robbers,\r\nthe fighting kings, the Matabele and the Madagascar \"heroes\" pass away,\r\nleaving their traces marked with blood and fire; but the nucleus of\r\nmutual-aid institutions, habits, and customs, grown up in the tribe and\r\nthe village community, remains; and it keeps men united in societies,\r\nopen to the progress of civilization, and ready to receive it when the\r\nday comes that they shall receive civilization instead of bullets.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to our civilized world. The natural and social\r\ncalamities pass away. Whole populations are periodically reduced to\r\nmisery or starvation; the very springs of life are crushed out of\r\nmillions of men, reduced to city pauperism; the understanding and the\r\nfeelings of the millions are vitiated by teachings worked out in the\r\ninterest of the few. All this is certainly a part of our existence. But\r\nthe nucleus of mutual-support institutions, habits, and customs remains\r\nalive with the millions; it keeps them together; and they prefer to\r\ncling to their customs, beliefs, and traditions rather than to accept\r\nthe teachings of a war of each against all, which are offered to them\r\nunder the title of science, but are no science at all.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1. A bulky literature, dealing with this formerly much neglected\r\nsubject, is now growing in Germany. Keller's works, Ein Apostel der\r\nWiedertaufer and Geschichte der Wiedertaufer, Cornelius's Geschichte des\r\nmunsterischen Aufruhrs, and Janssen's Geschichte des deutschen Volkes\r\nmay be named as the leading sources. The first attempt at familiarizing\r\nEnglish readers with the results of the wide researches made in Germany\r\nin this direction has been made in an excellent little work by Richard\r\nHeath--\"Anabaptism from its Rise at Zwickau to its Fall at Munster,\r\n1521-1536,\" London, 1895 (Baptist Manuals, vol. i.)--where the leading\r\nfeatures of the movement are well indicated, and full bibliographical\r\ninformation is given. Also K. Kautsky's Communism in Central Europe in\r\nthe Time of the Reformation, London, 1897.\r\n\r\n2. Few of our contemporaries realize both the extent of this movement\r\nand the means by which it was suppressed. But those who wrote\r\nimmediately after the great peasant war estimated at from 100,000 to\r\n150,000 men the number of peasants slaughtered after their defeat in\r\nGermany. See Zimmermann's Allgemeine Geschichte des grossen\r\nBauernkrieges.

Eight years before that date the communes had been taken under\r\nState management).\r\n\r\n4. \"On a great landlord's estate, even if he has millions of revenue,\r\nyou are sure to find the land uncultivated\" (Arthur Young). \"One-fourth\r\npart of the soil went out of culture;\" \"for the last hundred years the\r\nland has returned to a savage state;\" \"the formerly flourishing Sologne\r\nis now a big marsh;\" and so on (Theron de Montauge, quoted by Taine in\r\nOrigines de la France Contemporaine, tome i. p. 441).\r\n\r\n5.

After the triumph of the middle-class reaction the communal lands\r\nwere declared (August 24, 1794) the States domains, and, together with\r\nthe lands confiscated from the nobility, were put up for sale, and\r\npilfered by the bandes noires of the small bourgeoisie. True that a stop\r\nto this pilfering was put next year (law of 2 Prairial, An V), and the\r\npreceding law was abrogated; but then the village Communities were\r\nsimply abolished, and cantonal councils were introduced instead. Only\r\nseven years later (9 Prairial, An XII), i.e. in 1801, the village\r\ncommunities were reintroduced, but not until after having been deprived\r\nof all their rights, the mayor and syndics being nominated by the\r\nGovernment in the 36,000 communes of France! This system was maintained\r\ntill after the revolution of 1830, when elected communal councils were\r\nreintroduced under the law of 1787. As to the communal lands, they were\r\nagain seized upon by the State in 1813, plundered as such, and only\r\npartly restored to the communes in 1816. See the classical collection of\r\nFrench laws, by Dalloz, Repertoire de Jurisprudence; also the works of\r\nDoniol, Dareste, Bonnemere, Babeau, and many others.\r\n\r\n8. This procedure is so absurd that one would not believe it possible if\r\nthe fifty-two different acts were not enumerated in full by a quite\r\nauthoritative writer in the Journal des Economistes (1893, April, p.\r\n94), and several similar examples were not given by the same author.\r\n\r\n9.

And further on, \"They were generally drawn in the same\r\nform, commencing with the recital that the open and common fields lie\r\ndispersed in small pieces, intermixed with each other and inconveniently\r\nsituated; that divers persons own parts of them, and are entitled to\r\nrights of common on them ... and that it is desired that they may be\r\ndivided and enclosed, a specific share being let out and allowed to each\r\nowner\" (p. 14). Porter's list contained 3867 such Acts, of which the\r\ngreatest numbers fall upon the decades of 1770-1780 and 1800-1820, as in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n13.

In Switzerland the peasants in the open land also fell under the\r\ndominion of lords, and large parts of their estates were appropriated by\r\nthe lords in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. (cf. A.\r\nMiaskowski, in Schmoller's Forschungen, Bd. ii. 1879, pp. 12 seq.) But\r\nthe peasant war in Switzerland did not end in such a crushing defeat of\r\nthe peasants as it did in other countries, and a great deal of the\r\ncommunal rights and lands was retained. The self-government of the\r\ncommunes is, in fact, the very foundation of the Swiss liberties. (cf.\r\nK. Burtli, Der Ursprung der Eidgenossenschaft aus der\r\nMarkgenossenschaft, Zurich, 1891.)\r\n\r\n20. Dr. Reichesberg, Handworterbuch des Schweiz. Volkswirthschaft, Bern,\r\n1903.\r\n\r\n21.

The wedding gifts, which often substantially contribute in this\r\ncountry to the comfort of the young households, are evidently a\r\nremainder of the communal habits.\r\n\r\n23. The communes own, 4,554,100 acres of woods out of 24,813,000 in the\r\nwhole territory, and 6,936,300 acres of natural meadows out of\r\n11,394,000 acres in France. The remaining 2,000,000 acres are fields,\r\norchards, and so on.\r\n\r\n24. In Caucasia they even do better among the Georgians. As the meal\r\ncosts, and a poor man cannot afford to give it, a sheep is bought by\r\nthose same neighbours who come to aid in the work.\r\n\r\n25. Alfred Baudrillart, in H. Baudrillart's Les Populations Rurales de\r\nla France, 3rd series (Paris, 1893), p. 479.\r\n\r\n26. The Journal des Economistes (August 1892, May and August 1893) has\r\nlately given some of the results of analyses made at the agricultural\r\nlaboratories at Ghent and at Paris. The extent of falsification is\r\nsimply incredible; so also the devices of the \"honest traders.\" In\r\ncertain seeds of grass there was 32 per cent. of gains of sand, coloured\r\nso as to Receive even an experienced eye; other samples contained from\r\n52 to 22 per cent. only of pure seed, the remainder being weeds. Seeds\r\nof vetch contained 11 per cent. of a poisonous grass (nielle); a flour\r\nfor cattle-fattening contained 36 per cent. of sulphates; and so on ad\r\ninfinitum.\r\n\r\n27. A. Baudrillart, l.c. p. 309. Originally one grower would undertake\r\nto supply water, and several others would agee to make use of it. \"What\r\nespecially characterises such associations,\" A. Baudrillart remarks, \"is\r\nthat no sort of written agreement is concluded. All is arranged in\r\nwords. There was, however, not one single case of difficulties having\r\narisen between the parties.\"\r\n\r\n28. A. Baudrillart, l.c. pp. 300, 341, etc. M. Terssac, president of the\r\nSt. Gironnais syndicate (Ariege), wrote to my friend in substance as\r\nfollows:--\"For the exhibition of Toulouse our association has grouped\r\nthe owners of cattle which seemed to us worth exhibiting. The society\r\nundertook to pay one-half of the travelling and exhibition expenses;\r\none-fourth was paid by each owner, and the remaining fourth by those\r\nexhibitors who had got prizes. The result was that many took part in the\r\nexhibition who never would have done it otherwise. Those who got the\r\nhighest awards (350 francs) have contributed 10 per cent. of their\r\nprizes, while those who have got no prize have only spent 6 to 7 francs\r\neach.\"\r\n\r\n29. In Wurttemberg 1,629 communes out of 1,910 have communal property.\r\nThey owned in 1863 over 1,000,000 acres of land. In Baden 1,256 communes\r\nout of 1,582 have communal land; in 1884-1888 they held 121,500 acres of\r\nfields in communal culture, and 675,000 acres of forests, i.e. 46 per\r\ncent. of the total area under woods. In Saxony 39 per cent. of the total\r\narea is in communal ownership (Schmoller's Jahrbuch, 1886, p. 359). In\r\nHohenzollern nearly two-thirds of all meadow land, and in\r\nHohenzollern-Hechingen 41 per cent. of all landed property, are owned by\r\nthe village communities (Buchenberger, Agrarwesen, vol. i. p. 300).\r\n\r\n30. See K. Bucher, who, in a special chapter added to Laveleye's\r\nUreigenthum, has collected all information relative to the village\r\ncommunity in Germany.\r\n\r\n31. K.

Buchenberger, l.c. Bd. ii. p. 510. The General Union of Agricultural\r\nCo-operation comprises an aggregate of 1,679 societies. In Silesia an\r\naggregate of 32,000 acres of land has been lately drained by 73\r\nassociations; 454,800 acres in Prussia by 516 associations; in Bavaria\r\nthere are 1,715 drainage and irrigation unions.\r\n\r\n34. For the Balkan peninsula see Laveleye's Propriete Primitive.\r\n\r\n35. The facts concerning the village community, contained in nearly a\r\nhundred volumes (out of 450) of these inquests, have been classified and\r\nsummed up in an excellent Russian work by \"V.V.\" The Peasant Community\r\n(Krestianskaya Obschina), St. Petersburg, 1892, which, apart from its\r\ntheoretical value, is a rich compendium of data relative to this\r\nsubject. The above inquests have also given origin to an immense\r\nliterature, in which the modern village-community question for the first\r\ntime emerges from the domain of generalities and is put on the solid\r\nbasis of reliable and sufficiently detailed facts.\r\n\r\n36. The redemption had to be paid by annuities for forty-nine years. As\r\nyears went, and the greatest part of it was paid, it became easier and\r\neasier to redeem the smaller remaining part of it, and, as each\r\nallotment could be redeemed individually, advantage was taken of this\r\ndisposition by traders, who bought land for half its value from the\r\nruined peasants. A law was consequently passed to put a stop to such\r\nsales.\r\n\r\n37. Mr. V.V., in his Peasant Community, has grouped together all facts\r\nrelative to this movement. About the rapid agricultural development of\r\nSouth Russia and the spread of machinery English readers will find\r\ninformation in the Consular Reports (Odessa, Taganrog).\r\n\r\n38. In some instances they proceeded with great caution. In one village\r\nthey began by putting together all meadow land, but only a small portion\r\nof the fields (about five acres per soul) was rendered communal; the\r\nremainder continued to be owned individually. Later on, in 1862-1864,\r\nthe system was extended, but only in 1884 was communal possession\r\nintroduced in full.--V.V.'s Peasant Community, pp. 1-14.\r\n\r\n39. On the Mennonite village community see A. Klaus, Our Colonies (Nashi\r\nKolonii), St. Petersburg, 1869.\r\n\r\n40. Such communal cultures are known to exist in 159 villages out of 195\r\nin the Ostrogozhsk district; in 150 out of 187 in Slavyanoserbsk; in 107\r\nvillage communities in Alexandrovsk, 93 in Nikolayevsk, 35 in\r\nElisabethgrad. In a German colony the communal culture is made for\r\nrepaying a communal debt. All join in the work, although the debt was\r\ncontracted by 94 householders out of 155.\r\n\r\n41. Lists of such works which came under the notice of the zemstvo\r\nstatisticians will be found in V.V.'s Peasant Community, pp. 459-600.\r\n\r\n42. In the government of Moscow the experiment was usually made on the\r\nfield which was reserved for the above-mentioned communal culture.\r\n\r\n43. Several instances of such and similar improvements were given in the\r\nOfficial Messenger, 1894, Nos. 256-258. Associations between \"horseless\"\r\npeasants begin to appear also in South Russia. Another extremely\r\ninteresting fact is the sudden development in Southern West Siberia of\r\nvery numerous co-operative creameries for making butter. Hundreds of\r\nthem spread in Tobolsk and Tomsk, without any one knowing wherefrom the\r\ninitiative of the movement came. It came from the Danish co-operators,\r\nwho used to export their own butter of higher quality, and to buy butter\r\nof a lower quality for their own use in Siberia. After a several years'\r\nintercourse, they introduced creameries there. Now, a great export\r\ntrade, carried on by a Union of the Creameries, has grown out of their\r\nendeavours and more than a thousand co-operative shops have been opened\r\nin the villages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMUTUAL AID AMONGST OURSELVES (continued)\r\n\r\nLabour-unions grown after the destruction of the guilds by the State.\r\nTheir struggles. Mutual Aid in strikes. Co-operation. Free associations\r\nfor various purposes. Self-sacrifice. Countless societies for combined\r\naction under all possible aspects. Mutual Aid in slum-life. Personal\r\naid.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we examine the every-day life of the rural populations of Europe,\r\nwe find that, notwithstanding all that has been done in modern States\r\nfor the destruction of the village community, the life of the peasants\r\nremains honeycombed with habits and customs of mutual aid and support;\r\nthat important vestiges of the communal possession of the soil are still\r\nretained; and that, as soon as the legal obstacles to rural association\r\nwere lately removed, a network of free unions for all sorts of\r\neconomical purposes rapidly spread among the peasants--the tendency of\r\nthis young movement being to reconstitute some sort of union similar to\r\nthe village community of old. Such being the conclusions arrived at in\r\nthe preceding chapter, we have now to consider, what institutions for\r\nmutual support can be found at the present time amongst the industrial\r\npopulations.\r\n\r\nFor the last three hundred years, the conditions for the growth of such\r\ninstitutions have been as unfavourable in the towns as they have been in\r\nthe villages. It is well known, indeed, that when the medieval cities\r\nwere subdued in the sixteenth century by growing military States, all\r\ninstitutions which kept the artisans, the masters, and the merchants\r\ntogether in the guilds and the cities were violently destroyed. The\r\nself-government and the self-jurisdiction of both, the guild and the\r\ncity were abolished; the oath of allegiance between guild-brothers\r\nbecame an act of felony towards the State; the properties of the guilds\r\nwere confiscated in the same way as the lands of the village\r\ncommunities; and the inner and technical organization of each trade was\r\ntaken in hand by the State. Laws, gradually growing in severity, were\r\npassed to prevent artisans from combining in any way. For a time, some\r\nshadows of the old guilds were tolerated: merchants' guilds were allowed\r\nto exist under the condition of freely granting subsidies to the kings,\r\nand some artisan guilds were kept in existence as organs of\r\nadministration. Some of them still drag on their meaningless existence.\r\nBut what formerly was the vital force of medieval life and industry has\r\nlong since disappeared under the crushing weight of the centralized\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, which may be taken as the best illustration of the\r\nindustrial policy of the modern States, we see the Parliament beginning\r\nthe destruction of the guilds as early as the fifteenth century; but it\r\nwas especially in the next century that decisive measures were taken.\r\nHenry the Eighth not only ruined the organization of the guilds, but\r\nalso confiscated their properties, with even less excuse and manners, as\r\nToulmin Smith wrote, than he had produced for confiscating the estates\r\nof the monasteries.(1) Edward the Sixth completed his work,(2) and\r\nalready in the second part of the sixteenth century we find the\r\nParliament settling all the disputes between craftsmen and merchants,\r\nwhich formerly were settled in each city separately. The Parliament and\r\nthe king not only legislated in all such contests, but, keeping in view\r\nthe interests of the Crown in the exports, they soon began to determine\r\nthe number of apprentices in each trade and minutely to regulate the\r\nvery technics of each fabrication--the weights of the stuffs, the number\r\nof threads in the yard of cloth, and the like. With little success, it\r\nmust be said; because contests and technical difficulties which were\r\narranged for centuries in succession by agreement between\r\nclosely-interdependent guilds and federated cities lay entirely beyond\r\nthe powers of the centralized State. The continual interference of its\r\nofficials paralyzed the trades; bringing most of them to a complete\r\ndecay; and the last century economists, when they rose against the State\r\nregulation of industries, only ventilated a widely-felt discontent. The\r\nabolition of that interference by the French Revolution was greeted as\r\nan act of liberation, and the example of France was soon followed\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nWith the regulation of wages the State had no better success. In the\r\nmedieval cities, when the distinction between masters and apprentices or\r\njourneymen became more and more apparent in the fifteenth century,\r\nunions of apprentices (Gesellenverbande), occasionally assuming an\r\ninternational character, were opposed to the unions of masters and\r\nmerchants. Now it was the State which undertook to settle their griefs,\r\nand under the Elizabethan Statute of 1563 the Justices of Peace had to\r\nsettle the wages, so as to guarantee a \"convenient\" livelihood to\r\njourneymen and apprentices. The Justices, however, proved helpless to\r\nconciliate the conflicting interests, and still less to compel the\r\nmasters to obey their decisions. The law gradually became a dead letter,\r\nand was repealed by the end of the eighteenth century. But while the\r\nState thus abandoned the function of regulating wages, it continued\r\nseverely to prohibit all combinations which were entered upon by\r\njourneymen and workers in order to raise their wages, or to keep them at\r\na certain level. All through the eighteenth century it legislated\r\nagainst the workers' unions, and in 1799 it finally prohibited all sorts\r\nof combinations, under the menace of severe punishments. In fact, the\r\nBritish Parliament only followed in this case the example of the French\r\nRevolutionary Convention, which had issued a draconic law against\r\ncoalitions of workers-coalitions between a number of citizens being\r\nconsidered as attempts against the sovereignty of the State, which was\r\nsupposed equally to protect all its subjects. The work of destruction of\r\nthe medieval unions was thus completed. Both in the town and in the\r\nvillage the State reigned over loose aggregations of individuals, and\r\nwas ready to prevent by the most stringent measures the reconstitution\r\nof any sort of separate unions among them. These were, then, the\r\nconditions under which the mutual-aid tendency had to make its way in\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nNeed it be said that no such measures could destroy that tendency?\r\nThroughout the eighteenth century, the workers' unions were continually\r\nreconstituted.(3) Nor were they stopped by the cruel prosecutions which\r\ntook place under the laws of 1797 and 1799. Every flaw in supervision,\r\nevery delay of the masters in denouncing the unions was taken advantage\r\nof. Under the cover of friendly societies, burial clubs, or secret\r\nbrotherhoods, the unions spread in the textile industries, among the\r\nSheffield cutlers, the miners, and vigorous federal organizations were\r\nformed to support the branches during strikes and prosecutions.(4) The\r\nrepeal of the Combination Laws in 1825 gave a new impulse to the\r\nmovement. Unions and national federations were formed in all trades.(5)\r\nand when Robert Owen started his Grand National Consolidated Trades'\r\nUnion, it mustered half a million members in a few months. True that\r\nthis period of relative liberty did not last long. Prosecution began\r\nanew in the thirties, and the well-known ferocious condemnations of\r\n1832-1844 followed. The Grand National Union was disbanded, and all over\r\nthe country, both the private employers and the Government in its own\r\nworkshops began to compel the workers to resign all connection with\r\nunions, and to sign \"the Document\" to that effect. Unionists were\r\nprosecuted wholesale under the Master and Servant Act--workers being\r\nsummarily arrested and condemned upon a mere complaint of misbehaviour\r\nlodged by the master.(6) Strikes were suppressed in an autocratic way,\r\nand the most astounding condemnations took place for merely having\r\nannounced a strike or acted as a delegate in it--to say nothing of the\r\nmilitary suppression of strike riots, nor of the condemnations which\r\nfollowed the frequent outbursts of acts of violence. To practise mutual\r\nsupport under such circumstances was anything but an easy task. And yet,\r\nnotwithstanding all obstacles, of which our own generation hardly can\r\nhave an idea, the revival of the unions began again in 1841, and the\r\namalgamation of the workers has been steadily continued since. After a\r\nlong fight, which lasted for over a hundred years, the right of\r\ncombining together was conquered, and at the present time nearly\r\none-fourth part of the regularly-employed workers, i.e. about 1,500,000,\r\nbelong to trade unions.(7)\r\n\r\nAs to the other European States, sufficient to say that up to a very\r\nrecent date, all sorts of unions were prosecuted as conspiracies; and\r\nthat nevertheless they exist everywhere, even though they must often\r\ntake the form of secret societies; while the extension and the force of\r\nlabour organizations, and especially of the Knights of Labour, in the\r\nUnited States and in Belgium, have been sufficiently illustrated by\r\nstrikes in the nineties. It must, however, be borne in mind that,\r\nprosecution apart, the mere fact of belonging to a labour union implies\r\nconsiderable sacrifices in money, in time, and in unpaid work, and\r\ncontinually implies the risk of losing employment for the mere fact of\r\nbeing a unionist.(8) There is, moreover, the strike, which a unionist\r\nhas continually to face; and the grim reality of a strike is, that the\r\nlimited credit of a worker's family at the baker's and the pawnbroker's\r\nis soon exhausted, the strike-pay goes not far even for food, and hunger\r\nis soon written on the children's faces. For one who lives in close\r\ncontact with workers, a protracted strike is the most heartrending\r\nsight; while what a strike meant forty years ago in this country, and\r\nstill means in all but the wealthiest parts of the continent, can easily\r\nbe conceived. Continually, even now, strikes will end with the total\r\nruin and the forced emigration of whole populations, while the shooting\r\ndown of strikers on the slightest provocation, or even without any\r\nprovocation,(9) is quite habitual still on the continent.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, every year there are thousands of strikes and lock-outs in\r\nEurope and America--the most severe and protracted contests being, as a\r\nrule, the so-called \"sympathy strikes,\" which are entered upon to\r\nsupport locked-out comrades or to maintain the rights of the unions. And\r\nwhile a portion of the Press is prone to explain strikes by\r\n\"intimidation,\" those who have lived among strikers speak with\r\nadmiration of the mutual aid and support which are constantly practised\r\nby them. Every one has heard of the colossal amount of work which was\r\ndone by volunteer workers for organizing relief during the London\r\ndock-labourers' strike; of the miners who, after having themselves been\r\nidle for many weeks, paid a levy of four shillings a week to the strike\r\nfund when they resumed work; of the miner widow who, during the\r\nYorkshire labour war of 1894, brought her husband's life-savings to the\r\nstrike-fund; of the last loaf of bread being always shared with\r\nneighbours; of the Radstock miners, favoured with larger\r\nkitchen-gardens, who invited four hundred Bristol miners to take their\r\nshare of cabbage and potatoes, and so on. All newspaper correspondents,\r\nduring the great strike of miners in Yorkshire in 1894, knew heaps of\r\nsuch facts, although not all of them could report such \"irrelevant\"\r\nmatters to their respective papers.(10)\r\n\r\nUnionism is not, however, the only form in which the worker's need of\r\nmutual support finds its expression. There are, besides, the political\r\nassociations, whose activity many workers consider as more conducive to\r\ngeneral welfare than the trade-unions, limited as they are now in their\r\npurposes. Of course the mere fact of belonging to a political body\r\ncannot be taken as a manifestation of the mutual-aid tendency. We all\r\nknow that politics are the field in which the purely egotistic elements\r\nof society enter into the most entangled combinations with altruistic\r\naspirations. But every experienced politician knows that all great\r\npolitical movements were fought upon large and often distant issues, and\r\nthat those of them were the strongest which provoked most disinterested\r\nenthusiasm. All great historical movements have had this character, and\r\nfor our own generation Socialism stands in that case. \"Paid agitators\"\r\nis, no doubt, the favourite refrain of those who know nothing about it.\r\nThe truth, however, is that--to speak only of what I know personally--if\r\nI had kept a diary for the last twenty-four years and inscribed in it\r\nall the devotion and self-sacrifice which I came across in the Socialist\r\nmovement, the reader of such a diary would have had the word \"heroism\"\r\nconstantly on his lips. But the men I would have spoken of were not\r\nheroes; they were average men, inspired by a grand idea. Every Socialist\r\nnewspaper--and there are hundreds of them in Europe alone--has the same\r\nhistory of years of sacrifice without any hope of reward, and, in the\r\noverwhelming majority of cases, even without any personal ambition. I\r\nhave seen families living without knowing what would be their food\r\nto-morrow, the husband boycotted all round in his little town for his\r\npart in the paper, and the wife supporting the family by sewing, and\r\nsuch a situation lasting for years, until the family would retire,\r\nwithout a word of reproach, simply saying: \"Continue; we can hold on no\r\nmore!\" I have seen men, dying from consumption, and knowing it, and yet\r\nknocking about in snow and fog to prepare meetings, speaking at meetings\r\nwithin a few weeks from death, and only then retiring to the hospital\r\nwith the words: \"Now, friends, I am done; the doctors say I have but a\r\nfew weeks to live. Tell the comrades that I shall be happy if they come\r\nto see me.\" I have seen facts which would be described as \"idealization\"\r\nif I told them in this place; and the very names of these men, hardly\r\nknown outside a narrow circle of friends, will soon be forgotten when\r\nthe friends, too, have passed away. In fact, I don't know myself which\r\nmost to admire, the unbounded devotion of these few, or the sum total of\r\npetty acts of devotion of the great number. Every quire of a penny paper\r\nsold, every meeting, every hundred votes which are won at a Socialist\r\nelection, represent an amount of energy and sacrifices of which no\r\noutsider has the faintest idea. And what is now done by Socialists has\r\nbeen done in every popular and advanced party, political and religious,\r\nin the past. All past progress has been promoted by like men and by a\r\nlike devotion.\r\n\r\nCo-operation, especially in Britain, is often described as \"joint-stock\r\nindividualism\"; and such as it is now, it undoubtedly tends to breed a\r\nco-operative egotism, not only towards the community at large, but also\r\namong the co-operators themselves. It is, nevertheless, certain that at\r\nits origin the movement had an essentially mutual-aid character. Even\r\nnow, its most ardent promoters are persuaded that co-operation leads\r\nmankind to a higher harmonic stage of economical relations, and it is\r\nnot possible to stay in some of the strongholds of co-operation in the\r\nNorth without realizing that the great number of the rank and file hold\r\nthe same opinion. Most of them would lose interest in the movement if\r\nthat faith were gone; and it must be owned that within the last few\r\nyears broader ideals of general welfare and of the producers' solidarity\r\nhave begun to be current among the co-operators. There is undoubtedly\r\nnow a tendency towards establishing better relations between the owners\r\nof the co-operative workshops and the workers.\r\n\r\nThe importance of co-operation in this country, in Holland and in\r\nDenmark is well known; while in Germany, and especially on the Rhine,\r\nthe co-operative societies are already an important factor of industrial\r\nlife.(11) It is, however, Russia which offers perhaps the best field for\r\nthe study of cooperation under an infinite variety of aspects. In\r\nRussia, it is a natural growth, an inheritance from the middle ages; and\r\nwhile a formally established co-operative society would have to cope\r\nwith many legal difficulties and official suspicion, the informal\r\nco-operation--the artel--makes the very substance of Russian peasant\r\nlife. The history of \"the making of Russia,\" and of the colonization of\r\nSiberia, is a history of the hunting and trading artels or guilds,\r\nfollowed by village communities, and at the present time we find the\r\nartel everywhere; among each group of ten to fifty peasants who come\r\nfrom the same village to work at a factory, in all the building trades,\r\namong fishermen and hunters, among convicts on their way to and in\r\nSiberia, among railway porters, Exchange messengers, Customs House\r\nlabourers, everywhere in the village industries, which give occupation\r\nto 7,000,000 men--from top to bottom of the working world, permanent and\r\ntemporary, for production and consumption under all possible aspects.\r\nUntil now, many of the fishing-grounds on the tributaries of the Caspian\r\nSea are held by immense artels, the Ural river belonging to the whole of\r\nthe Ural Cossacks, who allot and re-allot the fishing-grounds--perhaps\r\nthe richest in the world--among the villages, without any interference\r\nof the authorities. Fishing is always made by artels in the Ural, the\r\nVolga, and all the lakes of Northern Russia. Besides these permanent\r\norganizations, there are the simply countless temporary artels,\r\nconstituted for each special purpose. When ten or twenty peasants come\r\nfrom some locality to a big town, to work as weavers, carpenters,\r\nmasons, boat-builders, and so on, they always constitute an artel. They\r\nhire rooms, hire a cook (very often the wife of one of them acts in this\r\ncapacity), elect an elder, and take their meals in common, each one\r\npaying his share for food and lodging to the artel. A party of convicts\r\non its way to Siberia always does the same, and its elected elder is the\r\nofficially-recognized intermediary between the convicts and the military\r\nchief of the party. In the hard-labour prisons they have the same\r\norganization. The railway porters, the messengers at the Exchange, the\r\nworkers at the Custom House, the town messengers in the capitals, who\r\nare collectively responsible for each member, enjoy such a reputation\r\nthat any amount of money or bank-notes is trusted to the artel-member by\r\nthe merchants. In the building trades, artels of from 10 to 200 members\r\nare formed; and the serious builders and railway contractors always\r\nprefer to deal with an artel than with separately-hired workers. The\r\nlast attempts of the Ministry of War to deal directly with productive\r\nartels, formed ad hoc in the domestic trades, and to give them orders\r\nfor boots and all sorts of brass and iron goods, are described as most\r\nsatisfactory; while the renting of a Crown iron work, (Votkinsk) to an\r\nartel of workers, which took place seven or eight years ago, has been a\r\ndecided success.\r\n\r\nWe can thus see in Russia how the old medieval institution, having not\r\nbeen interfered with by the State (in its informal manifestations), has\r\nfully survived until now, and takes the greatest variety of forms in\r\naccordance with the requirements of modern industry and commerce. As to\r\nthe Balkan peninsula, the Turkish Empire and Caucasia, the old guilds\r\nare maintained there in full. The esnafs of Servia have fully preserved\r\ntheir medieval character; they include both masters and journeymen,\r\nregulate the trades, and are institutions for mutual support in labour\r\nand sickness;(12) while the amkari of Caucasia, and especially at\r\nTiflis, add to these functions a considerable influence in municipal\r\nlife.(13)\r\n\r\nIn connection with co-operation, I ought perhaps to mention also the\r\nfriendly societies, the unities of oddfellows, the village and town\r\nclubs organized for meeting the doctors' bills, the dress and burial\r\nclubs, the small clubs very common among factory girls, to which they\r\ncontribute a few pence every week, and afterwards draw by lot the sum of\r\none pound, which can at least be used for some substantial purchase, and\r\nmany others. A not inconsiderable amount of sociable or jovial spirit is\r\nalive in all such societies and clubs, even though the \"credit and\r\ndebit\" of each member are closely watched over. But there are so many\r\nassociations based on the readiness to sacrifice time, health, and life\r\nif required, that we can produce numbers of illustrations of the best\r\nforms of mutual support.\r\n\r\nThe Lifeboat Association in this country, and similar institutions on\r\nthe Continent, must be mentioned in the first place. The former has now\r\nover three hundred boats along the coasts of these isles, and it would\r\nhave twice as many were it not for the poverty of the fisher men, who\r\ncannot afford to buy lifeboats. The crews consist, however, of\r\nvolunteers, whose readiness to sacrifice their lives for the rescue of\r\nabsolute strangers to them is put every year to a severe test; every\r\nwinter the loss of several of the bravest among them stands on record.\r\nAnd if we ask these men what moves them to risk their lives, even when\r\nthere is no reasonable chance of success, their answer is something on\r\nthe following lines. A fearful snowstorm, blowing across the Channel,\r\nraged on the flat, sandy coast of a tiny village in Kent, and a small\r\nsmack, laden with oranges, stranded on the sands near by. In these\r\nshallow waters only a flat-bottomed lifeboat of a simplified type can be\r\nkept, and to launch it during such a storm was to face an almost certain\r\ndisaster. And yet the men went out, fought for hours against the wind,\r\nand the boat capsized twice. One man was drowned, the others were cast\r\nashore. One of these last, a refined coastguard, was found next morning,\r\nbadly bruised and half frozen in the snow. I asked him, how they came to\r\nmake that desperate attempt? \"I don't know myself,\" was his reply.\"\r\nThere was the wreck; all the people from the village stood on the beach,\r\nand all said it would be foolish to go out; we never should work through\r\nthe surf. We saw five or six men clinging to the mast, making desperate\r\nsignals. We all felt that something must be done, but what could we do?\r\nOne hour passed, two hours, and we all stood there. We all felt most\r\nuncomfortable. Then, all of a sudden, through the storm, it seemed to us\r\nas if we heard their cries--they had a boy with them. We could not stand\r\nthat any longer. All at once we said, \"We must go!\" The women said so\r\ntoo; they would have treated us as cowards if we had not gone, although\r\nnext day they said we had been fools to go. As one man, we rushed to the\r\nboat, and went. The boat capsized, but we took hold of it. The worst was\r\nto see poor drowning by the side of the boat, and we could do nothing to\r\nsave him. Then came a fearful wave, the boat capsized again, and we were\r\ncast ashore. The men were still rescued by the D. boat, ours was caught\r\nmiles away. I was found next morning in the snow.\"\r\n\r\nThe same feeling moved also the miners of the Rhonda Valley, when they\r\nworked for the rescue of their comrades from the inundated mine. They\r\nhad pierced through thirty-two yards of coal in order to reach their\r\nentombed comrades; but when only three yards more remained to be\r\npierced, fire-damp enveloped them. The lamps went out, and the\r\nrescue-men retired. To work in such conditions was to risk being blown\r\nup at every moment. But the raps of the entombed miners were still\r\nheard, the men were still alive and appealed for help, and several\r\nminers volunteered to work at any risk; and as they went down the mine,\r\ntheir wives had only silent tears to follow them--not one word to stop\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere is the gist of human psychology. Unless men are maddened in the\r\nbattlefield, they \"cannot stand it\" to hear appeals for help, and not to\r\nrespond to them. The hero goes; and what the hero does, all feel that\r\nthey ought to have done as well. The sophisms of the brain cannot resist\r\nthe mutual-aid feeling, because this feeling has been nurtured by\r\nthousands of years of human social life and hundreds of thousands of\r\nyears of pre-human life in societies.\r\n\r\n\"But what about those men who were drowned in the Serpentine in the\r\npresence of a crowd, out of which no one moved for their rescue?\" it may\r\nbe asked. \"What about the child which fell into the Regent's Park\r\nCanal--also in the presence of a holiday crowd--and was only saved\r\nthrough the presence of mind of a maid who let out a Newfoundland dog to\r\nthe rescue?\" The answer is plain enough. Man is a result of both his\r\ninherited instincts and his education. Among the miners and the seamen,\r\ntheir common occupations and their every-day contact with one another\r\ncreate a feeling of solidarity, while the surrounding dangers maintain\r\ncourage and pluck. In the cities, on the contrary, the absence of common\r\ninterest nurtures indifference, while courage and pluck, which seldom\r\nfind their opportunities, disappear, or take another direction.\r\nMoreover, the tradition of the hero of the mine and the sea lives in the\r\nminers' and fishermen's villages, adorned with a poetical halo. But what\r\nare the traditions of a motley London crowd? The only tradition they\r\nmight have in common ought to be created by literature, but a literature\r\nwhich would correspond to the village epics hardly exists. The clergy\r\nare so anxious to prove that all that comes from human nature is sin,\r\nand that all good in man has a supernatural origin, that they mostly\r\nignore the facts which cannot be produced as an example of higher\r\ninspiration or grace, coming from above. And as to the lay-writers,\r\ntheir attention is chiefly directed towards one sort of heroism, the\r\nheroism which promotes the idea of the State. Therefore, they admire the\r\nRoman hero, or the soldier in the battle, while they pass by the\r\nfisherman's heroism, hardly paying attention to it. The poet and the\r\npainter might, of course, be taken by the beauty of the human heart in\r\nitself; but both seldom know the life of the poorer classes, and while\r\nthey can sing or paint the Roman or the military hero in conventional\r\nsurroundings, they can neither sing nor paint impressively the hero who\r\nacts in those modest surroundings which they ignore. If they venture to\r\ndo so, they produce a mere piece of rhetoric.(14)\r\n\r\nThe countless societies, clubs, and alliances, for the enjoyment of\r\nlife, for study and research, for education, and so on, which have\r\nlately grown up in such numbers that it would require many years to\r\nsimply tabulate them, are another manifestation of the same everworking\r\ntendency for association and mutual support. Some of them, like the\r\nbroods of young birds of different species which come together in the\r\nautumn, are entirely given to share in common the joys of life. Every\r\nvillage in this country, in Switzerland, Germany, and so on, has its\r\ncricket, football, tennis, nine-pins, pigeon, musical or singing clubs.\r\nOther societies are much more numerous, and some of them, like the\r\nCyclists' Alliance, have suddenly taken a formidable development.\r\nAlthough the members of this alliance have nothing in common but the\r\nlove of cycling, there is already among them a sort of freemasonry for\r\nmutual help, especially in the remote nooks and corners which are not\r\nflooded by cyclists; they look upon the \"C.A.C.\"--the Cyclists' Alliance\r\nClub--in a village as a sort of home; and at the yearly Cyclists' Camp\r\nmany a standing friendship has been established. The Kegelbruder, the\r\nBrothers of the Nine Pins, in Germany, are a similar association; so\r\nalso the Gymnasts' Societies (300,000 members in Germany), the informal\r\nbrotherhood of paddlers in France, the yacht clubs, and so on. Such\r\nassociations certainly do not alter the economical stratification of\r\nsociety, but, especially in the small towns, they contribute to smooth\r\nsocial distinctions, and as they all tend to join in large national and\r\ninternational federations, they certainly aid the growth of personal\r\nfriendly intercourse between all sorts of men scattered in different\r\nparts of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe Alpine Clubs, the Jagdschutzverein in Germany, which has over\r\n100,000 members--hunters, educated foresters, zoologists, and simple\r\nlovers of Nature--and the International Ornithological Society, which\r\nincludes zoologists, breeders, and simple peasants in Germany, have the\r\nsame character. Not only have they done in a few years a large amount of\r\nvery useful work, which large associations alone could do properly\r\n(maps, refuge huts, mountain roads; studies of animal life, of noxious\r\ninsects, of migrations of birds, and so on), but they create new bonds\r\nbetween men. Two Alpinists of different nationalities who meet in a\r\nrefuge hut in the Caucasus, or the professor and the peasant\r\nornithologist who stay in the same house, are no more strangers to each\r\nother; while the Uncle Toby's Society at Newcastle, which has already\r\ninduced over 260,000 boys and girls never to destroy birds' nests and to\r\nbe kind to all animals, has certainly done more for the development of\r\nhuman feelings and of taste in natural science than lots of moralists\r\nand most of our schools.\r\n\r\nWe cannot omit, even in this rapid review, the thousands of scientific,\r\nliterary, artistic, and educational societies. Up till now, the\r\nscientific bodies, closely controlled and often subsidized by the State,\r\nhave generally moved in a very narrow circle, and they often came to be\r\nlooked upon as mere openings for getting State appointments, while the\r\nvery narrowness of their circles undoubtedly bred petty jealousies.\r\nStill it is a fact that the distinctions of birth, political parties and\r\ncreeds are smoothed to some extent by such associations; while in the\r\nsmaller and remote towns the scientific, geographical, or musical\r\nsocieties, especially those of them which appeal to a larger circle of\r\namateurs, become small centres of intellectual life, a sort of link\r\nbetween the little spot and the wide world, and a place where men of\r\nvery different conditions meet on a footing of equality. To fully\r\nappreciate the value of such centres, one ought to know them, say, in\r\nSiberia. As to the countless educational societies which only now begin\r\nto break down the State's and the Church's monopoly in education, they\r\nare sure to become before long the leading power in that branch. To the\r\n\"Froebel Unions\" we already owe the Kindergarten system; and to a number\r\nof formal and informal educational associations we owe the high standard\r\nof women's education in Russia, although all the time these societies\r\nand groups had to act in strong opposition to a powerful government.(15)\r\nAs to the various pedagogical societies in Germany, it is well known\r\nthat they have done the best part in the working out of the modern\r\nmethods of teaching science in popular schools. In such associations the\r\nteacher finds also his best support. How miserable the overworked and\r\nunder-paid village teacher would have been without their aid!(16)\r\n\r\nAll these associations, societies, brotherhoods, alliances, institutes,\r\nand so on, which must now be counted by the ten thousand in Europe\r\nalone, and each of which represents an immense amount of voluntary,\r\nunambitious, and unpaid or underpaid work--what are they but so many\r\nmanifestations, under an infinite variety of aspects, of the same\r\never-living tendency of man towards mutual aid and support? For nearly\r\nthree centuries men were prevented from joining hands even for literary,\r\nartistic, and educational purposes. Societies could only be formed under\r\nthe protection of the State, or the Church, or as secret brotherhoods,\r\nlike free-masonry. But now that the resistance has been broken, they\r\nswarm in all directions, they extend over all multifarious branches of\r\nhuman activity, they become international, and they undoubtedly\r\ncontribute, to an extent which cannot yet be fully appreciated, to break\r\ndown the screens erected by States between different nationalities.\r\nNotwithstanding the jealousies which are bred by commercial competition,\r\nand the provocations to hatred which are sounded by the ghosts of a\r\ndecaying past, there is a conscience of international solidarity which\r\nis growing both among the leading spirits of the world and the masses of\r\nthe workers, since they also have conquered the right of international\r\nintercourse; and in the preventing of a European war during the last\r\nquarter of a century, this spirit has undoubtedly had its share.\r\n\r\nThe religious charitable associations, which again represent a whole\r\nworld, certainly must be mentioned in this place. There is not the\r\nslightest doubt that the great bulk of their members are moved by the\r\nsame mutual-aid feelings which are common to all mankind. Unhappily the\r\nreligious teachers of men prefer to ascribe to such feelings a\r\nsupernatural origin. Many of them pretend that man does not consciously\r\nobey the mutual-aid inspiration so long as he has not been enlightened\r\nby the teachings of the special religion which they represent, and, with\r\nSt. Augustin, most of them do not recognize such feelings in the \"pagan\r\nsavage.\" Moreover, while early Christianity, like all other religions,\r\nwas an appeal to the broadly human feelings of mutual aid and sympathy,\r\nthe Christian Church has aided the State in wrecking all standing\r\ninstitutions of mutual aid and support which were anterior to it, or\r\ndeveloped outside of it; and, instead of the mutual aid which every\r\nsavage considers as due to his kinsman, it has preached charity which\r\nbears a character of inspiration from above, and, accordingly, implies a\r\ncertain superiority of the giver upon the receiver. With this\r\nlimitation, and without any intention to give offence to those who\r\nconsider themselves as a body elect when they accomplish acts simply\r\nhumane, we certainly may consider the immense numbers of religious\r\ncharitable associations as an outcome of the same mutual-aid tendency.\r\n\r\nAll these facts show that a reckless prosecution of personal interests,\r\nwith no regard to other people's needs, is not the only characteristic\r\nof modern life. By the side of this current which so proudly claims\r\nleadership in human affairs, we perceive a hard struggle sustained by\r\nboth the rural and industrial populations in order to reintroduce\r\nstanding institutions of mutual aid and support; and we discover, in all\r\nclasses of society, a widely-spread movement towards the establishment\r\nof an infinite variety of more or less permanent institutions for the\r\nsame purpose. But when we pass from public life to the private life of\r\nthe modern individual, we discover another extremely wide world of\r\nmutual aid and support, which only passes unnoticed by most sociologists\r\nbecause it is limited to the narrow circle of the family and personal\r\nfriendship.(17)\r\n\r\nUnder the present social system, all bonds of union among the\r\ninhabitants of the same street or neighbourhood have been dissolved. In\r\nthe richer parts of the large towns, people live without knowing who are\r\ntheir next-door neighbours. But in the crowded lanes people know each\r\nother perfectly, and are continually brought into mutual contact. Of\r\ncourse, petty quarrels go their course, in the lanes as elsewhere; but\r\ngroupings in accordance with personal affinities grow up, and within\r\ntheir circle mutual aid is practised to an extent of which the richer\r\nclasses have no idea. If we take, for instance, the children of a poor\r\nneighbourhood who play in a street or a churchyard, or on a green, we\r\nnotice at once that a close union exists among them, notwithstanding the\r\ntemporary fights, and that that union protects them from all sorts of\r\nmisfortunes. As soon as a mite bends inquisitively over the opening of a\r\ndrain--\"Don't stop there,\" another mite shouts out, \"fever sits in the\r\nhole!\" \"Don't climb over that wall, the train will kill you if you\r\ntumble down! Don't come near to the ditch! Don't eat those\r\nberries--poison! you will die.\" Such are the first teachings imparted to\r\nthe urchin when he joins his mates out-doors. How many of the children\r\nwhose play-grounds are the pavements around \"model workers' dwellings,\"\r\nor the quays and bridges of the canals, would be crushed to death by the\r\ncarts or drowned in the muddy waters, were it not for that sort of\r\nmutual support. And when a fair Jack has made a slip into the\r\nunprotected ditch at the back of the milkman's yard, or a cherry-cheeked\r\nLizzie has, after all, tumbled down into the canal, the young brood\r\nraises such cries that all the neighbourhood is on the alert and rushes\r\nto the rescue.\r\n\r\nThen comes in the alliance of the mothers. \"You could not imagine\" (a\r\nlady-doctor who lives in a poor neighbourhood told me lately) \"how much\r\nthey help each other. If a woman has prepared nothing, or could prepare\r\nnothing, for the baby which she expected--and how often that\r\nhappens!--all the neighbours bring something for the new-comer. One of\r\nthe neighbours always takes care of the children, and some other always\r\ndrops in to take care of the household, so long as the mother is in\r\nbed.\" This habit is general. It is mentioned by all those who have lived\r\namong the poor. In a thousand small ways the mothers support each other\r\nand bestow their care upon children that are not their own. Some\r\ntraining--good or bad, let them decide it for themselves--is required in\r\na lady of the richer classes to render her able to pass by a shivering\r\nand hungry child in the street without noticing it. But the mothers of\r\nthe poorer classes have not that training. They cannot stand the sight\r\nof a hungry child; they must feed it, and so they do. \"When the school\r\nchildren beg bread, they seldom or rather never meet with a refusal\"--a\r\nlady-friend, who has worked several years in Whitechapel in connection\r\nwith a workers' club, writes to me. But I may, perhaps, as well\r\ntranscribe a few more passages from her letter:--\r\n\r\n\"Nursing neighbours, in cases of illness, without any shade of\r\nremuneration, is quite general among the workers. Also, when a woman has\r\nlittle children, and goes out for work, another mother always takes care\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\"If, in the working classes, they would not help each other, they could\r\nnot exist. I know families which continually help each other--with\r\nmoney, with food, with fuel, for bringing up the little children, in\r\ncases of illness, in cases of death.\r\n\r\n\"'The mine' and 'thine' is much less sharply observed among the poor\r\nthan among the rich. Shoes, dress, hats, and so on,--what may be wanted\r\non the spot--are continually borrowed from each other, also all sorts of\r\nhousehold things.\r\n\r\n\"Last winter the members of the United Radical Club had brought together\r\nsome little money, and began after Christmas to distribute free soup and\r\nbread to the children going to school. Gradually they had 1,800 children\r\nto attend to. The money came from outsiders, but all the work was done\r\nby the members of the club. Some of them, who were out of work, came at\r\nfour in the morning to wash and to peel the vegetables; five women came\r\nat nine or ten (after having done their own household work) for cooking,\r\nand stayed till six or seven to wash the dishes. And at meal time,\r\nbetween twelve and half-past one, twenty to thirty workers came in to\r\naid in serving the soup, each one staying what he could spare of his\r\nmeal time. This lasted for two months. No one was paid.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend also mentions various individual cases, of which the following\r\nare typical:--\r\n\r\n\"Annie W. was given by her mother to be boarded by an old person in\r\nWilmot Street. When her mother died, the old woman, who herself was very\r\npoor, kept the child without being paid a penny for that. When the old\r\nlady died too, the child, who was five years old, was of course\r\nneglected during her illness, and was ragged; but she was taken at once\r\nby Mrs. S., the wife of a shoemaker, who herself has six children.\r\nLately, when the husband was ill, they had not much to eat, all of them.\r\n\r\n\"The other day, Mrs. M., mother of six children, attended Mrs. M--g\r\nthroughout her illness, and took to her own rooms the elder child....\r\nBut do you need such facts? They are quite general.... I know also Mrs.\r\nD. (Oval, Hackney Road), who has a sewing machine and continually sews\r\nfor others, without ever accepting any remuneration, although she has\r\nherself five children and her husband to look after.... And so on.\"\r\n\r\nFor every one who has any idea of the life of the labouring classes it\r\nis evident that without mutual aid being practised among them on a large\r\nscale they never could pull through all their difficulties. It is only\r\nby chance that a worker's family can live its lifetime without having to\r\nface such circumstances as the crisis described by the ribbon weaver,\r\nJoseph Gutteridge, in his autobiography.(18) And if all do not go to the\r\nground in such cases, they owe it to mutual help. In Gutteridge's case\r\nit was an old nurse, miserably poor herself, who turned up at the moment\r\nwhen the family was slipping towards a final catastrophe, and brought in\r\nsome bread, coal, and bedding, which she had obtained on credit. In\r\nother cases, it will be some one else, or the neighbours will take steps\r\nto save the family. But without some aid from other poor, how many more\r\nwould be brought every year to irreparable ruin!(19)\r\n\r\nMr. Plimsoll, after he had lived for some time among the poor, on 7s.\r\n6d. a week, was compelled to recognize that the kindly feelings he took\r\nwith him when he began this life \"changed into hearty respect and\r\nadmiration\" when he saw how the relations between the poor are permeated\r\nwith mutual aid and support, and learned the simple ways in which that\r\nsupport is given. After a many years' experience, his conclusion was\r\nthat \"when you come to think of it, such as these men were, so were the\r\nvast majority of the working classes.\"(20) As to bringing up orphans,\r\neven by the poorest families, it is so widely-spread a habit, that it\r\nmay be described as a general rule; thus among the miners it was found,\r\nafter the two explosions at Warren Vale and at Lund Hill, that \"nearly\r\none-third of the men killed, as the respective committees can testify,\r\nwere thus supporting relations other than wife and child.\" \"Have you\r\nreflected,\" Mr. Plimsoll added, \"what this is? Rich men, even\r\ncomfortably-to-do men do this, I don't doubt. But consider the\r\ndifference.\" Consider what a sum of one shilling, subscribed by each\r\nworker to help a comrade's widow, or 6d. to help a fellow-worker to\r\ndefray the extra expense of a funeral, means for one who earns 16s. a\r\nweek and has a wife, and in some cases five or six children to\r\nsupport.(21) But such subscriptions are a general practice among the\r\nworkers all over the world, even in much more ordinary cases than a\r\ndeath in the family, while aid in work is the commonest thing in their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nNor do the same practices of mutual aid and support fail among the\r\nricher classes. Of course, when one thinks of the harshness which is\r\noften shown by the richer employers towards their employees, one feels\r\ninclined to take the most pessimist view of human nature. Many must\r\nremember the indignation which was aroused during the great Yorkshire\r\nstrike of 1894, when old miners who had picked coal from an abandoned\r\npit were prosecuted by the colliery owners. And, even if we leave aside\r\nthe horrors of the periods of struggle and social war, such as the\r\nextermination of thousands of workers' prisoners after the fall of the\r\nParis Commune--who can read, for instance, revelations of the labour\r\ninquest which was made here in the forties, or what Lord Shaftesbury\r\nwrote about \"the frightful waste of human life in the factories, to\r\nwhich the children taken from the workhouses, or simply purchased all\r\nover this country to be sold as factory slaves, were consigned\"(22)--who\r\ncan read that without being vividly impressed by the baseness which is\r\npossible in man when his greediness is at stake? But it must also be\r\nsaid that all fault for such treatment must not be thrown entirely upon\r\nthe criminality of human nature. Were not the teachings of men of\r\nscience, and even of a notable portion of the clergy, up to a quite\r\nrecent time, teachings of distrust, despite and almost hatred towards\r\nthe poorer classes? Did not science teach that since serfdom has been\r\nabolished, no one need be poor unless for his own vices? And how few in\r\nthe Church had the courage to blame the children-killers, while the\r\ngreat numbers taught that the sufferings of the poor, and even the\r\nslavery of the negroes, were part of the Divine Plan! Was not\r\nNonconformism itself largely a popular protest against the harsh\r\ntreatment of the poor at the hand of the established Church?\r\n\r\nWith such spiritual leaders, the feelings of the richer classes\r\nnecessarily became, as Mr. Pimsoll remarked, not so much blunted as\r\n\"stratified.\" They seldom went downwards towards the poor, from whom the\r\nwell-to-do-people are separated by their manner of life, and whom they\r\ndo not know under their best aspects, in their every-day life. But among\r\nthemselves--allowance being made for the effects of the\r\nwealth-accumulating passions and the futile expenses imposed by wealth\r\nitself--among themselves, in the circle of family and friends, the rich\r\npractise the same mutual aid and support as the poor. Dr. Ihering and L.\r\nDargun are perfectly right in saying that if a statistical record could\r\nbe taken of all the money which passes from hand to hand in the shape of\r\nfriendly loans and aid, the sum total would be enormous, even in\r\ncomparison with the commercial transactions of the world's trade. And if\r\nwe could add to it, as we certainly ought to, what is spent in\r\nhospitality, petty mutual services, the management of other people's\r\naffairs, gifts and charities, we certainly should be struck by the\r\nimportance of such transfers in national economy. Even in the world\r\nwhich is ruled by commercial egotism, the current expression, \"We have\r\nbeen harshly treated by that firm,\" shows that there is also the\r\nfriendly treatment, as opposed to the harsh, i.e. the legal treatment;\r\nwhile every commercial man knows how many firms are saved every year\r\nfrom failure by the friendly support of other firms.\r\n\r\nAs to the charities and the amounts of work for general well-being which\r\nare voluntarily done by so many well-to-do persons, as well as by\r\nworkers, and especially by professional men, every one knows the part\r\nwhich is played by these two categories of benevolence in modern life.\r\nIf the desire of acquiring notoriety, political power, or social\r\ndistinction often spoils the true character of that sort of benevolence,\r\nthere is no doubt possible as to the impulse coming in the majority of\r\ncases from the same mutual-aid feelings. Men who have acquired wealth\r\nvery often do not find in it the expected satisfaction. Others begin to\r\nfeel that, whatever economists may say about wealth being the reward of\r\ncapacity, their own reward is exaggerated. The conscience of human\r\nsolidarity begins to tell; and, although society life is so arranged as\r\nto stifle that feeling by thousands of artful means, it often gets the\r\nupper hand; and then they try to find an outcome for that deeply human\r\nneed by giving their fortune, or their forces, to something which, in\r\ntheir opinion, will promote general welfare.\r\n\r\nIn short, neither the crushing powers of the centralized State nor the\r\nteachings of mutual hatred and pitiless struggle which came, adorned\r\nwith the attributes of science, from obliging philosophers and\r\nsociologists, could weed out the feeling of human solidarity, deeply\r\nlodged in men's understanding and heart, because it has been nurtured by\r\nall our preceding evolution. What was the outcome of evolution since its\r\nearliest stages cannot be overpowered by one of the aspects of that same\r\nevolution. And the need of mutual aid and support which had lately taken\r\nrefuge in the narrow circle of the family, or the slum neighbours, in\r\nthe village, or the secret union of workers, re-asserts itself again,\r\neven in our modern society, and claims its rights to be, as it always\r\nhas been, the chief leader towards further progress. Such are the\r\nconclusions which we are necessarily brought to when we carefully ponder\r\nover each of the groups of facts briefly enumerated in the last two\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1.

The London artisans are supposed to have never been better\r\norganized than in 1810-20.\r\n\r\n5. The National Association for the Protection of Labour included about\r\n150 separate unions, which paid high levies, and had a membership of\r\nabout 100,000. The Builders' Union and the Miners' Unions also were big\r\norganizations (Webb, l.c. p. 107).\r\n\r\n6. I follow in this Mr. Webb's work, which is replete with documents to\r\nconfirm his statements.\r\n\r\n7. Great changes have taken place since the forties in the attitude of\r\nthe richer classes towards the unions. However, even in the sixties, the\r\nemployers made a formidable concerted attempt to crush them by locking\r\nout whole populations. Up to 1869 the simple agreement to strike, and\r\nthe announcement of a strike by placards, to say nothing of picketing,\r\nwere often punished as intimidation. Only in 1875 the Master and Servant\r\nAct was repealed, peaceful picketing was permitted, and \"violence and\r\nintimidation\" during strikes fell into the domain of common law. Yet,\r\neven during the dock-labourers' strike in 1887, relief money had to be\r\nspent for fighting before the Courts for the right of picketing, while\r\nthe prosecutions of the last few years menace once more to render the\r\nconquered rights illusory.\r\n\r\n8. A weekly contribution of 6d. out of an 18s. wage, or of 1s. out of\r\n25s., means much more than 9l. out of a 300l. income: it is mostly taken\r\nupon food; and the levy is soon doubled when a strike is declared in a\r\nbrother union. The graphic description of trade-union life, by a skilled\r\ncraftsman, published by Mr. and Mrs. Webb (pp. 431 seq.), gives an\r\nexcellent idea of the amount of work required from a unionist.\r\n\r\n9. See the debates upon the strikes of Falkenau in Austria before the\r\nAustrian Reichstag on the 10th of May, 1894, in which debates the fact\r\nis fully recognized by the Ministry and the owner of the colliery.

The 31,473 productive and consumers' associations on the Middle\r\nRhine showed, about 1890, a yearly expenditure of 18,437,500l.;\r\n3,675,000l. were granted during the year in loans.\r\n\r\n12.

Escape from a French prison is extremely difficult; nevertheless a\r\nprisoner escaped from one of the French prisons in 1884 or 1885. He even\r\nmanaged to conceal himself during the whole day, although the alarm was\r\ngiven and the peasants in the neighbourhood were on the look-out for\r\nhim. Next morning found him concealed in a ditch, close by a small\r\nvillage. Perhaps he intended to steal some food, or some clothes in\r\norder to take off his prison uniform. As he was lying in the ditch a\r\nfire broke out in the village. He saw a woman running out of one of the\r\nburning houses, and heard her desperate appeals to rescue a child in the\r\nupper storey of the burning house. No one moved to do so. Then the\r\nescaped prisoner dashed out of his retreat, made his way through the\r\nfire, and, with a scalded face and burning clothes, brought the child\r\nsafe out of the fire, and handed it to its mother. Of course he was\r\narrested on the spot by the village gendarme, who now made his\r\nappearance. He was taken back to the prison. The fact was reported in\r\nall French papers, but none of them bestirred itself to obtain his\r\nrelease. If he had shielded a warder from a comrade's blow, he would\r\nhave been made a hero of. But his act was simply humane, it did not\r\npromote the State's ideal; he himself did not attribute it to a sudden\r\ninspiration of divine grace; and that was enough to let the man fall\r\ninto oblivion. Perhaps, six or twelve months were added to his sentence\r\nfor having stolen--\"the State's property\"--the prison's dress.\r\n\r\n15. The medical Academy for Women (which has given to Russia a large\r\nportion of her 700 graduated lady doctors), the four Ladies'\r\nUniversities (about 1000 pupils in 1887; closed that year, and reopened\r\nin 1895), and the High Commercial School for Women are entirely the work\r\nof such private societies. To the same societies we owe the high\r\nstandard which the girls' gymnasia attained since they were opened in\r\nthe sixties. The 100 gymnasia now scattered over the Empire (over 70,000\r\npupils), correspond to the High Schools for Girls in this country; all\r\nteachers are, however, graduates of the universities.\r\n\r\n16. The Verein für Verbreitung gemeinnutslicher Kenntnisse, although it\r\nhas only 5500 members, has already opened more than 1000 public and\r\nschool libraries, organized thousands of lectures, and published most\r\nvaluable books.\r\n\r\n17. Very few writers in sociology have paid attention to it. Dr. Ihering\r\nis one of them, and his case is very instructive. When the great German\r\nwriter on law began his philosophical work, Der Zweck im Rechte\r\n(\"Purpose in Law\"), he intended to analyze \"the active forces which call\r\nforth the advance of society and maintain it,\" and to thus give \"the\r\ntheory of the sociable man.\" He analyzed, first, the egotistic forces at\r\nwork, including the present wage-system and coercion in its variety of\r\npolitical and social laws; and in a carefully worked-out scheme of his\r\nwork he intended to give the last paragraph to the ethical forces--the\r\nsense of duty and mutual love--which contribute to the same aim. When he\r\ncame, however, to discuss the social functions of these two factors, he\r\nhad to write a second volume, twice as big as the first; and yet he\r\ntreated only of the personal factors which will take in the following\r\npages only a few lines. L. Dargun took up the same idea in Egoismus und\r\nAltruismus in der Nationalokonomie, Leipzig, 1885, adding some new\r\nfacts. Buchner's Love, and the several paraphrases of it published here\r\nand in Germany, deal with the same subject.\r\n\r\n18. Light and Shadows in the Life of an Artisan. Coventry, 1893.\r\n\r\n19. Many rich people cannot understand how the very poor can help each\r\nother, because they do not realize upon what infinitesimal amounts of\r\nfood or money often hangs the life of one of the poorest classes. Lord\r\nShaftesbury had understood this terrible truth when he started his\r\nFlowers and Watercress Girls' Fund, out of which loans of one pound, and\r\nonly occasionally two pounds, were granted, to enable the girls to buy a\r\nbasket and flowers when the winter sets in and they are in dire\r\ndistress. The loans were given to girls who had \"not a sixpence,\" but\r\nnever failed to find some other poor to go bail for them. \"Of all the\r\nmovements I have ever been connected with,\" Lord Shaftesbury wrote, \"I\r\nlook upon this Watercress Girls' movement as the most successful.... It\r\nwas begun in 1872, and we have had out 800 to 1,000 loans, and have not\r\nlost 50l. during the whole period.... What has been lost--and it has\r\nbeen very little, under the circumstances--has been by reason of death\r\nor sickness, not by fraud\" (The Life and Work of the Seventh Earl of\r\nShaftesbury, by Edwin Hodder, vol. iii. p. 322. London, 1885-86).\r\nSeveral more facts in point in Ch. Booth's Life and Labour in London,\r\nvol. i; in Miss Beatrice Potter's \"Pages from a Work Girl's Diary\"\r\n(Nineteenth Century, September 1888, p. 310); and so on.\r\n\r\n20.

Mr. Plimsoll added: \"I don't wish to\r\ndisparage the rich, but I think it may be reasonably doubted whether\r\nthese qualities are so fully developed in them; for, notwithstanding\r\nthat not a few of them are not unacquainted with the claims, reasonable\r\nor unreasonable, of poor relatives, these qualities are not in such\r\nconstant exercise. Riches seem in so many cases to smother the manliness\r\nof their possessors, and their sympathies become, not so much narrowed\r\nas--so to speak--stratified: they are reserved for the sufferings of\r\ntheir own class, and also the woes of those above them. They seldom tend\r\ndownwards much, and they are far more likely to admire an act of courage\r\n... than to admire the constantly exercised fortitude and the tenderness\r\nwhich are the daily characteristics of a British workman's life\"--and of\r\nthe workmen all over the world as well.\r\n\r\n22. Life of the Seventh Earl of Shaftesbury, by Edwin Hodder, vol. i.\r\npp. 137-138.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we take now the teachings which can be borrowed from the analysis of\r\nmodern society, in connection with the body of evidence relative to the\r\nimportance of mutual aid in the evolution of the animal world and of\r\nmankind, we may sum up our inquiry as follows.\r\n\r\nIn the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live\r\nin societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the\r\nstruggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian\r\nsense--not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a\r\nstruggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The\r\nanimal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its\r\nnarrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the\r\ngreatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most\r\nprosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection\r\nwhich is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and\r\nof accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the\r\nfurther growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the\r\nspecies, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The\r\nunsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.\r\n\r\nGoing next over to man, we found him living in clans and tribes at the\r\nvery dawn of the stone age; we saw a wide series of social institutions\r\ndeveloped already in the lower savage stage, in the clan and the tribe;\r\nand we found that the earliest tribal customs and habits gave to mankind\r\nthe embryo of all the institutions which made later on the leading\r\naspects of further progress. Out of the savage tribe grew up the\r\nbarbarian village community; and a new, still wider, circle of social\r\ncustoms, habits, and institutions, numbers of which are still alive\r\namong ourselves, was developed under the principles of common possession\r\nof a given territory and common defence of it, under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe village folkmote, and in the federation of villages belonging, or\r\nsupposed to belong, to one stem. And when new requirements induced men\r\nto make a new start, they made it in the city, which represented a\r\ndouble network of territorial units (village communities), connected\r\nwith guilds these latter arising out of the common prosecution of a\r\ngiven art or craft, or for mutual support and defence.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, in the last two chapters facts were produced to show that\r\nalthough the growth of the State on the pattern of Imperial Rome had put\r\na violent end to all medieval institutions for mutual support, this new\r\naspect of civilization could not last. The State, based upon loose\r\naggregations of individuals and undertaking to be their only bond of\r\nunion, did not answer its purpose. The mutual-aid tendency finally broke\r\ndown its iron rules; it reappeared and reasserted itself in an infinity\r\nof associations which now tend to embrace all aspects of life and to\r\ntake possession of all that is required by man for life and for\r\nreproducing the waste occasioned by life.\r\n\r\nIt will probably be remarked that mutual aid, even though it may\r\nrepresent one of the factors of evolution, covers nevertheless one\r\naspect only of human relations; that by the side of this current,\r\npowerful though it may be, there is, and always has been, the other\r\ncurrent--the self-assertion of the individual, not only in its efforts\r\nto attain personal or caste superiority, economical, political, and\r\nspiritual, but also in its much more important although less evident\r\nfunction of breaking through the bonds, always prone to become\r\ncrystallized, which the tribe, the village community, the city, and the\r\nState impose upon the individual. In other words, there is the\r\nself-assertion of the individual taken as a progressive element.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that no review of evolution can be complete, unless these\r\ntwo dominant currents are analyzed. However, the self-assertion of the\r\nindividual or of groups of individuals, their struggles for superiority,\r\nand the conflicts which resulted therefrom, have already been analyzed,\r\ndescribed, and glorified from time immemorial. In fact, up to the\r\npresent time, this current alone has received attention from the epical\r\npoet, the annalist, the historian, and the sociologist. History, such as\r\nit has hitherto been written, is almost entirely a description of the\r\nways and means by which theocracy, military power, autocracy, and, later\r\non, the richer classes' rule have been promoted, established, and\r\nmaintained. The struggles between these forces make, in fact, the\r\nsubstance of history. We may thus take the knowledge of the individual\r\nfactor in human history as granted--even though there is full room for a\r\nnew study of the subject on the lines just alluded to; while, on the\r\nother side, the mutual-aid factor has been hitherto totally lost sight\r\nof; it was simply denied, or even scoffed at, by the writers of the\r\npresent and past generation. It was therefore necessary to show, first\r\nof all, the immense part which this factor plays in the evolution of\r\nboth the animal world and human societies. Only after this has been\r\nfully recognized will it be possible to proceed to a comparison between\r\nthe two factors.\r\n\r\nTo make even a rough estimate of their relative importance by any method\r\nmore or less statistical, is evidently impossible. One single war--we\r\nall know--may be productive of more evil, immediate and subsequent, than\r\nhundreds of years of the unchecked action of the mutual-aid principle\r\nmay be productive of good. But when we see that in the animal world,\r\nprogressive development and mutual aid go hand in hand, while the inner\r\nstruggle within the species is concomitant with retrogressive\r\ndevelopment; when we notice that with man, even success in struggle and\r\nwar is proportionate to the development of mutual aid in each of the two\r\nconflicting nations, cities, parties, or tribes, and that in the process\r\nof evolution war itself (so far as it can go this way) has been made\r\nsubservient to the ends of progress in mutual aid within the nation, the\r\ncity or the clan--we already obtain a perception of the dominating\r\ninfluence of the mutual-aid factor as an element of progress. But we see\r\nalso that the practice of mutual aid and its successive developments\r\nhave created the very conditions of society life in which man was\r\nenabled to develop his arts, knowledge, and intelligence; and that the\r\nperiods when institutions based on the mutual-aid tendency took their\r\ngreatest development were also the periods of the greatest progress in\r\narts, industry, and science. In fact, the study of the inner life of the\r\nmedieval city and of the ancient Greek cities reveals the fact that the\r\ncombination of mutual aid, as it was practised within the guild and the\r\nGreek clan, with a large initiative which was left to the individual and\r\nthe group by means of the federative principle, gave to mankind the two\r\ngreatest periods of its history--the ancient Greek city and the medieval\r\ncity periods; while the ruin of the above institutions during the State\r\nperiods of history, which followed, corresponded in both cases to a\r\nrapid decay.\r\n\r\nAs to the sudden industrial progress which has been achieved during our\r\nown century, and which is usually ascribed to the triumph of\r\nindividualism and competition, it certainly has a much deeper origin\r\nthan that. Once the great discoveries of the fifteenth century were\r\nmade, especially that of the pressure of the atmosphere, supported by a\r\nseries of advances in natural philosophy--and they were made under the\r\nmedieval city organization,--once these discoveries were made, the\r\ninvention of the steam-motor, and all the revolution which the conquest\r\nof a new power implied, had necessarily to follow. If the medieval\r\ncities had lived to bring their discoveries to that point, the ethical\r\nconsequences of the revolution effected by steam might have been\r\ndifferent; but the same revolution in technics and science would have\r\ninevitably taken place. It remains, indeed, an open question whether the\r\ngeneral decay of industries which followed the ruin of the free cities,\r\nand was especially noticeable in the first part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, did not considerably retard the appearance of the steam-engine\r\nas well as the consequent revolution in arts. When we consider the\r\nastounding rapidity of industrial progress from the twelfth to the\r\nfifteenth centuries--in weaving, working of metals, architecture and\r\nnavigation, and ponder over the scientific discoveries which that\r\nindustrial progress led to at the end of the fifteenth century--we must\r\nask ourselves whether mankind was not delayed in its taking full\r\nadvantage of these conquests when a general depression of arts and\r\nindustries took place in Europe after the decay of medieval\r\ncivilization. Surely it was not the disappearance of the artist-artisan,\r\nnor the ruin of large cities and the extinction of intercourse between\r\nthem, which could favour the industrial revolution; and we know indeed\r\nthat James Watt spent twenty or more years of his life in order to\r\nrender his invention serviceable, because he could not find in the last\r\ncentury what he would have readily found in medieval Florence or Brugge,\r\nthat is, the artisans capable of realizing his devices in metal, and of\r\ngiving them the artistic finish and precision which the steam-engine\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\nTo attribute, therefore, the industrial progress of our century to the\r\nwar of each against all which it has proclaimed, is to reason like the\r\nman who, knowing not the causes of rain, attributes it to the victim he\r\nhas immolated before his clay idol. For industrial progress, as for each\r\nother conquest over nature, mutual aid and close intercourse certainly\r\nare, as they have been, much more advantageous than mutual struggle.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is especially in the domain of ethics that the dominating\r\nimportance of the mutual-aid principle appears in full. That mutual aid\r\nis the real foundation of our ethical conceptions seems evident enough.\r\nBut whatever the opinions as to the first origin of the mutual-aid\r\nfeeling or instinct may be whether a biological or a supernatural cause\r\nis ascribed to it--we must trace its existence as far back as to the\r\nlowest stages of the animal world; and from these stages we can follow\r\nits uninterrupted evolution, in opposition to a number of contrary\r\nagencies, through all degrees of human development, up to the present\r\ntimes. Even the new religions which were born from time to time--always\r\nat epochs when the mutual-aid principle was falling into decay in the\r\ntheocracies and despotic States of the East, or at the decline of the\r\nRoman Empire--even the new religions have only reaffirmed that same\r\nprinciple. They found their first supporters among the humble, in the\r\nlowest, downtrodden layers of society, where the mutual-aid principle is\r\nthe necessary foundation of every-day life; and the new forms of union\r\nwhich were introduced in the earliest Buddhist and Christian\r\ncommunities, in the Moravian brotherhoods and so on, took the character\r\nof a return to the best aspects of mutual aid in early tribal life.\r\n\r\nEach time, however, that an attempt to return to this old principle was\r\nmade, its fundamental idea itself was widened. From the clan it was\r\nextended to the stem, to the federation of stems, to the nation, and\r\nfinally--in ideal, at least--to the whole of mankind. It was also\r\nrefined at the same time. In primitive Buddhism, in primitive\r\nChristianity, in the writings of some of the Mussulman teachers, in the\r\nearly movements of the Reform, and especially in the ethical and\r\nphilosophical movements of the last century and of our own times, the\r\ntotal abandonment of the idea of revenge, or of \"due reward\"--of good\r\nfor good and evil for evil--is affirmed more and more vigorously. The\r\nhigher conception of \"no revenge for wrongs,\" and of freely giving more\r\nthan one expects to receive from his neighbours, is proclaimed as being\r\nthe real principle of morality--a principle superior to mere\r\nequivalence, equity, or justice, and more conducive to happiness. And\r\nman is appealed to to be guided in his acts, not merely by love, which\r\nis always personal, or at the best tribal, but by the perception of his\r\noneness with each human being. In the practice of mutual aid, which we\r\ncan retrace to the earliest beginnings of evolution, we thus find the\r\npositive and undoubted origin of our ethical conceptions; and we can\r\naffirm that in the ethical progress of man, mutual support not mutual\r\nstruggle--has had the leading part. In its wide extension, even at the\r\npresent time, we also see the best guarantee of a still loftier\r\nevolution of our race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Mutual Aid, by kniaz' Petr Alekseevich Kropotkin",
