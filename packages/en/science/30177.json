He was a young fellow, very sure of himself, and very\r\nkindly towards an old man.\r\n\r\nHe was doing a monograph, he said, for his own amusement, upon the\r\nearly forms of our present offensive and defensive weapons. Could I\r\ntell him about the first Deuber spheres and the earlier disintegrator\r\nrays and the crude atomic bombs we tried back when I first entered the\r\nService?\r\n\r\nI could, of course. And I did. But a man's memory does not improve in\r\nthe course of a century of Earth years. Our scientists have not been\r\nable to keep a man's brain as fresh as his body, despite all their\r\nvaunted progress. There is a lot these deep thinkers, in their great\r\nlaboratories, don't know. The whole universe gives them the credit for\r\nwhat's been done, yet the men of action who carried out the ideas--but\r\nI'm getting away from my pert young officer.\r\n\r\nHe listened to me with interest and toleration. Now and then he helped\r\nme out, when my memory failed me on some little detail. He seemed to\r\nhave a very fair theoretical knowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\n\"It seems impossible,\" he commented, when we had gone over the ground\r\nhe had outlined, \"that the Service could have done its work with such\r\ncrude and undeveloped weapons, does it not?\" He smiled in a superior\r\nsort of way, as though to imply we had probably done the best we\r\ncould, under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI suppose I should not have permitted his attitude to irritate me, but\r\nI am an old man, and my life has not been an easy one.\r\n\r\n\"Youngster,\" I said--like many old people, I prefer spoken\r\nconversation--\"back in those days the Service was handicapped in every\r\nway. We lacked weapons, we lacked instruments, we lacked popular\r\nsupport, and backing. But we had men, in those days, who did their\r\nwork with the tools that were at hand. And we did it well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" the youngster said hastily--after all, a retired commander\r\nin the Special Patrol Service does rate a certain amount of respect,\r\neven from these perky youngsters--\"I know that, sir. It was the\r\nefforts of men like yourself who gave us the proud traditions we have\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's hardly true,\" I corrected him. \"I'm not quite so old as\r\nthat. We had a fine set of traditions when I entered the Service, son.\r\nBut we did our share to carry them on, I'll grant you that.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Nothing Less than Complete Success,'\" quoted the lad almost\r\nreverently, giving the ancient motto of our service. \"That is a fine\r\ntradition for a body of men to aspire to, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"True. True.\" The ring in the boy's voice brought memories flocking.\r\nIt was a proud motto; as old as I am, the words bring a thrill even\r\nnow, a thrill comparable only with that which comes from seeing old\r\nEarth swell up out of the darkness of space after days of outer\r\nemptiness. Old Earth, with her wispy white clouds and her broad seas--\r\nOh, I know I'm provincial, but that is another thing that must be\r\nforgiven an old man.\r\n\r\n\"I imagine, sir,\" said the young officer, \"that you could tell many a\r\nstrange story of the Service, and the sacrifices men have made to keep\r\nthat motto the proud boast it is to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I told him. \"I could do that. I have done so. That is my\r\noccupation, now that I have been retired from active service. I--\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a historian?\" he broke in eagerly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI forgave him the interruption. I can still remember my own rather\r\nimpetuous youth.\r\n\r\n\"Do I look like a historian?\" I think I smiled as I asked him the\r\nquestion, and held out my hands to him. Big brown hands they are,\r\nhardened with work, stained and drawn from old acid burns, and the\r\nbite of blue electric fire. In my day we worked with crude tools\r\nindeed; tools that left their mark upon the workman.\r\n\r\n\"No. But--\"\r\n\r\nI waved the explanation aside.\r\n\r\n\"Historians deal with facts, with accomplishments, with dates and\r\nplaces and the names of great men. I write--what little I do write--of\r\nmen and high adventures, so that in this time of softness and easy\r\nliving some few who may read my scribblings may live with me those\r\ndays when the worlds of the universe were strange to each other, and\r\nthere were many new things to be found and marveled at.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'll venture, sir, that you find much enjoyment in the work,\"\r\ncommented the youngster with a degree of perception with which I had\r\nnot credited him.\r\n\r\n\"True. As I write, forgotten faces peer at me through the mists of the\r\nyears, and strong, friendly voices call to me from out of the\r\npast....\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be wonderful to live the old adventures through again,\" said\r\nthe young officer hastily. Youth is always afraid of sentiment in old\r\npeople. Why this should be, I do not know. But it is so.\r\n\r\nThe lad--I wish I had made a note of his name; I predict a future for\r\nhim in the Service--left me alone, then, with the thoughts he had\r\nstirred up in my mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOld faces ... old voices. Old scenes, too.\r\n\r\nStrange worlds, strange peoples. A hundred, a thousand different\r\ntongues. Men that came only to my knee, and men that towered ten feet\r\nabove my head. Creatures--possessed of all the attributes of men\r\nexcept physical form--that belonged only in the nightmare realms of\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nAn old man's most treasured possessions: his memories. A face drew\r\nclose out of the flocking recollections; the face of a man I had known\r\nand loved more than a brother so many years--dear God, how many\r\nyears--ago.\r\n\r\nAnderson Croy. Search all the voluminous records of the bearded\r\nhistorians, and you will not find his name. No great figure of history\r\nwas this friend of mine; just an obscure officer on an obscure ship of\r\nthe Special Patrol Service.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there is a people who owe to him their very existence.\r\n\r\nI wonder if they have forgotten him? It would not surprise me.\r\n\r\nThe memory of the universe is not a reliable thing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnderson Croy was, like most of the officer personnel of the Special\r\nPatrol Service, a native of Earth.\r\n\r\nThey had tried to make a stoop-shouldered dabbler in formulas out of\r\nhim, but he was not the stuff from which good scientists are moulded.\r\nHe was young, when I first knew him, and strong; he had mild blue eyes\r\nand a quick smile. And he had a fine, steely courage that a man could\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nI was in command, then, of the _Ertak_, my second ship. I inherited\r\nAnderson Croy with the ship, and I liked him from the first time I\r\nlaid eyes upon him.\r\n\r\nAs I recall it, we worked together on the _Ertak_ for nearly two\r\nyears, Earth time. We went through some tight places together. I\r\nremember our experience, shortly after I took over the _Ertak_, on the\r\nmonstrous planet Callor, whose tiny, gentle people were attacked by\r\nstrange, vapid Things that come down upon them from the fastness of\r\nthe polar cap, and--\r\n\r\nBut I wander from the story I wish to tell here. An old man's mind is\r\na weak and weary thing that totters and weaves from side to side; like\r\na worn-out ship, it is hard to keep on a straight course.\r\n\r\nWe were out on one of those long, monotonous patrols, skirting the\r\nouter boundaries of the known universe, that were, at that time,\r\nbefore the building of all the many stations we have to-day a dreaded\r\npart of the Special Patrol Service routine.\r\n\r\nNot once had we landed to stretch our legs. Slowing up to atmospheric\r\nspeed took time, and we were on a schedule that allowed for no waste\r\nof even minutes. We approached the various worlds only close enough to\r\nreport, and to receive an assurance that all was well. A dog's life,\r\nbut part of the game.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy log showed nearly a hundred \"All's well\" reports, as I remember it,\r\nwhen we slid up to Antri, which was, so far as size is concerned, one\r\nof our smallest ports o' call.\r\n\r\nAntri, I might add, for the benefit of those who have forgotten their\r\nmaps of the universe, is a satellite of A-411, which, in turn, is one\r\nof the largest bodies of the universe, and both uninhabited and\r\nuninhabitable. Antri is somewhat larger than the moon, Earth's\r\nsatellite, and considerably farther from its controlling body.\r\n\r\n\"Report our presence, Mr. Croy,\" I ordered wearily. \"And please ask\r\nMr. Correy to keep a sharp watch on the attraction meter.\" These huge\r\nbodies such as A-411 are not pleasant companions at space speeds. A\r\nfew minute's trouble--space ships gave trouble, in those days--and you\r\nmelted like a drop of solder when you struck the atmospheric belt.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" There never was a crisper young officer than Croy.\r\n\r\nI bent over my tables, working out our position and charting our\r\ncourse for the next period. In a few seconds Croy was back, his blue\r\neyes gleaming.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, an emergency is reported on Antri. We are to make all possible\r\nspeed, to Oreo, their governing city. I gather that it is very\r\nimportant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Mr. Croy.\" I can't say the news was unwelcome. Monotony\r\nkills young men. \"Have the disintegrator ray generators inspected and\r\ntested. Turn out the watch below in such time that we may have all\r\nhands on duty when we arrive. If there is an emergency, we shall be\r\nprepared for it. I shall be with Mr. Correy in the navigating room; if\r\nthere are any further communications, relay them to me there.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI hurried up to the navigating room, and gave Correy his orders.\r\n\r\n\"Do not reduce speed until it is absolutely necessary,\" I concluded.\r\n\"We have an emergency call from Antri, and minutes may be important.\r\nHow long do you make it to Oreo?\"\r\n\r\n\"About an hour to the atmosphere; say an hour more to set down in the\r\ncity. I believe that's about right, sir.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded, frowning at the twin charts, with their softly glowing\r\nlights, and turned to the television disc, picking up Antri without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nOf course, back in those days we had the huge and cumbersome discs,\r\ntheir faces shielded by a hood, that would be suitable only for museum\r\npieces now. But they did their work very well, and I searched Antri\r\ncarefully, at varying ranges, for any sign of disturbances. I found\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nThe dark portion, of course, I could not penetrate. Antri has one\r\nportion of its face that is turned forever from its sun, and one half\r\nthat is bathed in perpetual light. The long twilight zone was\r\nuninhabited, for the people of Antri are a sun-loving race, and their\r\ncities and villages appeared only in the bright areas of perpetual\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nJust as we reduced to atmospheric speed, Croy sent up a message\r\n\r\n\"The Governing Council sends word that we are to set down on the\r\nplatform atop the Hall of Government, the large, square white building\r\nin the center of the city. They say we will have no difficulty in\r\nlocating it.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked him and ordered him to stand by for further messages, if\r\nany, and picked up the far-flung city of Oreo in my television disc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the building Croy had mentioned. It stood out\r\nfrom the city around it, cool and white, its mighty columns glistening\r\nlike crystal in the sun. I could even make out the landing platform,\r\nslightly elevated above the roof on spidery arches of silvery metal.\r\n\r\nWe sped straight for the city at just a fraction of space speed, but\r\nthe hand of the surface temperature gauge crept slowly toward the red\r\nline that marked the dangerous incandescent point. I saw that Correy,\r\nlike the good navigating officer he was, was watching the gauge as\r\nclosely as myself, and hence said nothing. We both knew that the\r\nAntrians would not have sent a call for help to a ship of the Special\r\nPatrol Service if there had not been a real emergency.\r\n\r\nCorrey had made a good guess in saying that it would take about an\r\nhour, after entering the gaseous envelope of Antri, to reach our\r\ndestination. It was just a few minutes--Earth time, of course--less\r\nthan that when we settled gently onto the landing platform.\r\n\r\nA group of six or seven Antrians, dignified old men, wearing the\r\nshort, loosely belted white robes that we found were their universal\r\ncostume, were waiting for us at the exit of the _Ertak_, whose sleek,\r\nsmooth sides were glowing dull red.\r\n\r\n\"You have hastened, and that is well, sirs,\" said the spokesman of the\r\ncommittee. \"You find Antri in dire need.\" He spoke in the universal\r\nlanguage, and spoke it softly and perfectly. \"But you will pardon me\r\nfor greeting you with that which is, of necessity, uppermost in my\r\nmind, and in the minds of these, my companions.\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to welcome you to Antri, and to introduce those who extend\r\nthose greetings.\" Rapidly, he ran through a list of names, and each of\r\nthe men bowed gravely in acknowledgment of our greetings. I have never\r\nobserved a more courteous nor a more courtly people than the Antrians;\r\ntheir manners are as beautiful as their faces.\r\n\r\nLast of all, their spokesman introduced himself. Bori Tulber, he was\r\ncalled, and he had the honor of being master of the Council--the chief\r\nexecutive of Antri.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the introductions had been completed, the committee led our\r\nlittle party to a small, cylindrical elevator which dropped us,\r\nswiftly and silently, on a cushion of air, to the street level of the\r\ngreat building. Across a wide, gleaming corridor our conductors led\r\nus, and stood aside before a massive portal through which ten men\r\nmight have walked abreast.\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves in a great chamber with a vaulted ceiling of\r\nbright, gleaming metal. At the far end of the room was an elevated\r\nrostrum, flanked on either side by huge, intricate masses of statuary,\r\nof some creamy, translucent stone that glowed as with some inner\r\nlight. Semicircular rows of seats, each with its carved desk,\r\nsurmounted by numerous electrical controls, occupied all the floor\r\nspace. None of the seats was occupied.\r\n\r\n\"We have excused the Council from our preliminary deliberations,\"\r\nexplained Bori Tulber, \"because such a large body is unwieldy. My\r\ncompanions and myself represent the executive heads of the various\r\ndepartments of the Council, and we are empowered to act.\" He led us\r\nthrough the great council chamber, and into an anteroom, beautifully\r\ndecorated, and furnished with exceedingly comfortable chairs.\r\n\r\n\"Be seated, sirs,\" the Master of the Council suggested. We obeyed\r\nsilently, and Bori Tulber stood before, gazing thoughtfully into\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I do not know just where to begin,\" he said slowly. \"You men in\r\nuniform know, I presume, but little of this world of ours. I presume I\r\nhad best begin far back.\r\n\r\n\"Since you are navigators of space, undoubtedly, you are acquainted\r\nwith the fact that Antri is a world divided into two parts; one of\r\nperpetual night, and the other of perpetual day, due to the fact that\r\nAntri revolves but once upon its axis during the course of its circuit\r\nof its sun, thus presenting always the same face to our luminary.\r\n\r\n\"We have no day and night, such as obtain on other spheres. There are\r\nno set hours for working nor for sleeping nor for pleasure. The\r\nmeasure of a man's work is the measure of his ambition, or his\r\nstrength, or his desire. It is so also with his sleep and with his\r\npleasures. It is--it has been--a very pleasant arrangement.\r\n\r\n\"Ours is a fertile country, and our people live very long and very\r\nhappily with little effort. We have believed that ours was the nearest\r\nof all the worlds to the ideal; that nothing could disturb the peace\r\nand happiness of our people. We were mistaken.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"There is a dark side to Antri. A side upon which the sun never has\r\nshone. A dismal place of gloom, which is like the night upon other\r\nworlds.\r\n\r\n\"No Antrian has, to our knowledge, ever penetrated this part of Antri,\r\nand lived to tell of his experience. We do not even till the land\r\nclose to the twilight zone. Why should we, when we have so much fine\r\nland upon which the sun shines bright and fair always, save for the\r\ntwo brief seasons of rain?\r\n\r\n\"We have never given thought to what might be on the dark face of\r\nAntri. Darkness and night are things unknown to us; we know of them\r\nonly from the knowledge which has come to us from other worlds. And\r\nnow--now we have been brought face to face with a terrible danger\r\nwhich comes to us from that other side of this sphere.\r\n\r\n\"A people have grown there. A terrible people that I shall not try to\r\ndescribe to you. They threaten us with slavery, with extinction. Four\r\nara ago (the Antrians have their own system of reckoning time, just as\r\nwe have on Earth, instead of using the universal system, based upon\r\nthe enaro. An ara corresponds to about fifty hours, Earth time.) we\r\ndid not know that such a people existed. Now their shadow is upon all\r\nour beautifully sunny country, and unless you can aid us, before other\r\nhelp can reach us, I am convinced that Antri is doomed!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a moment not one of us spoke. We sat there, staring at the old man\r\nwho had just ceased speaking.\r\n\r\nOnly a man ripened and seasoned with the passing of years could have\r\nstood there before us and uttered, so quietly and solemnly, words such\r\nas had just come from his lips. Only in his eyes could we catch a\r\nglimpse of the torment which gripped his soul.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" I said, and have never felt younger than at that moment, when I\r\ntried to frame some assurance to this splendid old man who had turned\r\nto me and my youthful crew for succor, \"we shall do what it lies\r\nwithin our power to do. But tell us more of this danger which\r\nthreatens.\r\n\r\n\"I am no man of science, and yet I cannot see how men could live in a\r\nland never reached by the sun. There would be no heat, no vegetation.\r\nIs that not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would that it were!\" replied the Master of the Council, bitterly.\r\n\"What you say would be indeed the truth, were it not for the great\r\nriver and seas of our sunny Antri, which bear their heated waters to\r\nthis dark portion of our world, and make it habitable.\r\n\r\n\"And as for this danger, there is little to be said. At some time, men\r\nof our country, men who fish, or venture upon the water in commerce,\r\nhave been borne, all unwillingly, across the shadowy twilight zone and\r\ninto the land of darkness. They did not come back, but they were found\r\nthere and despoiled of their menores.\r\n\r\n\"Somehow, these creatures who dwell in darkness determined the use of\r\nthe menore, and now that they have resolved that they shall rule all\r\nthis sphere, they have been able to make their threat clear to us.\r\nPerhaps\"--and Bori Tulber smiled faintly and terribly--\"you would like\r\nto have that message direct from its bearer?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Is that possible, sir?\" I asked eagerly, glancing around the room.\r\n\"How--\"\r\n\r\n\"Come with me,\" said the Master of the Council gently. \"Alone--for too\r\nmany near him excites this terrible messenger. You have your menore?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I had not thought there would be need of it.\" The menores of\r\nthose days, it should be remembered, were heavy, cumbersome circlets\r\nthat were worn upon the head like a sort of crown, and one did not go\r\nso equipped unless in real need of the device. To-day, of course, your\r\nmenores are but jeweled trinkets that convey thought a score of times\r\nmore effectively, and weigh but a tenth as much.\r\n\r\n\"It is a lack easily remedied.\" Bori Tulber excused himself with a\r\nlittle bow and hurried out into the great council chamber, to appear\r\nagain in a moment with a menore in either hand.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if your companions and mine will excuse us for a moment....\" He\r\nsmiled around the seated group apologetically. There was a murmur of\r\nassent, and the old man opened a door in the other side of the room.\r\n\r\n\"It is not far,\" he said. \"I will go first, and show you the way.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe led me quickly down a long, narrow corridor to a pair of steep\r\nstairs that circled far down into the very foundation of the building.\r\nThe walls of the corridor and the stairs were without windows, but\r\nwere as bright as noonday from the ethon tubes which were set into\r\nboth ceiling and walls.\r\n\r\nSilently we circled our way down the spiral stairs, and silently the\r\nMaster of the Council paused before a door at the bottom--a door of\r\ndull red metal.\r\n\r\n\"This is the keeping place of those who come before the Council\r\ncharged with wrong doing,\" explained Bori Tulber. His fingers rested\r\nupon and pressed certain of a ring of small white buttons in the face\r\nof the door, and it opened swiftly and noiselessly. We entered, and\r\nthe door closed behind us with a soft thud.\r\n\r\n\"Behold one of those who live in the darkness,\" said the Master of the\r\nCouncil grimly. \"Do not put on the menore until you have a grip upon\r\nyourself: I would not have him know how greatly he disturbs us.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded, dumbly, holding the heavy menore dangling in my hand.\r\n\r\nI have said that I have beheld strange worlds and strange people in my\r\nlife, and it is true that I have. I have seen the headless people of\r\nthat red world Iralo, the ant people, the dragon-fly people, the\r\nterrible carnivorous trees of L-472, and the pointed heads of a people\r\nwho live upon a world which may not be named. But I have still to see\r\na more terrible creature than that which lay before me now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe--or it--was reclining upon the floor, for the reason that he could\r\nnot have stood. No room save one with a vaulted ceiling such as the\r\ngreat council chamber, could offer room enough for this creature to\r\nwalk erect.\r\n\r\nHe was, roughly, a shade better than twice my height, yet I believe he\r\nwould have weighed but little more. You have seen rank weeds that have\r\ngrown up in the darkness to reach the sun; if you can imagine a man\r\nwho had done likewise, you can, perhaps, picture that which I saw\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\nHis legs at the thigh were no larger than my arm, and his arms were\r\nbut half the size of my wrist, and jointed twice instead of but once.\r\nHe wore a careless garment of some dirty yellow, shaggy hide, and his\r\nskin, revealed on feet and arms and face, was a terrible, bloodless\r\nwhite; the dead white of a fish's belly. Maggot white. The white of\r\nsomething that had never known the sun.\r\n\r\nThe head was small and round, with features that were a caricature of\r\nman's. His ears were huge, and had the power of movement, for they\r\ncocked forward as we entered the room. The nose was not prominently\r\narched, but the nostrils were wide, and very thin, as was his mouth,\r\nwhich was faintly tinged with dusky blue, instead of healthy red. At\r\none time his eyes had been nearly round, and, in proportion, very\r\nlarge. Now they were but shadowy pockets, mercifully covered by\r\nshrunken, wrinkled lids that twitched but did not lift.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe moved as we entered, and from a reclining position, propped up on\r\nthe double elbows of one spidery arm, he changed to a sitting position\r\nthat brought his head nearly to the ceiling. He smiled sickeningly,\r\nand a queer, sibilant whispering came from the bluish lips.\r\n\r\n\"That is his way of talking,\" explained Bori Tulber. \"His eyes, you\r\nwill note, have been gouged out. They cannot stand the light; they\r\nprepared their messenger carefully for his work, you'll see.\"\r\n\r\nHe placed his menore upon his head, and motioned me to do likewise.\r\nThe creature searched the floor with one white, leathery hand, and\r\nfinally located his menore, which he adjusted clumsily.\r\n\r\n\"You will have to be very attentive,\" explained my companion. \"He\r\nexpresses himself in terms of pictures only, of course, and his is not\r\na highly developed mind. I shall try to get him to go over the entire\r\nstory for us again, if I can make him understand. Emanate nothing\r\nyourself; he is easily confused.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded silently, my eyes fixed with a sort of fascination upon the\r\ncreature from the darkness, and waited.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBack on the _Ertak_ again. I called all my officers together for a\r\nconference.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" I said, \"we are confronted with a problem of such gravity\r\nthat I doubt my ability to describe it clearly.\r\n\r\n\"Briefly, this civilized, beautiful portion of Antri is menaced by a\r\nterrible fate. In the dark portion of this unhappy world there live a\r\npeople who have the lust of conquest in their hearts--and the means at\r\nhand with which to wreck this world of perpetual sunlight.\r\n\r\n\"I have the ultimatum of this people direct from their messenger. They\r\nwant a terrible tribute in the form of slaves. These slaves would have\r\nto live in perpetual darkness, and wait upon the whims of the most\r\nmonstrous beings these eyes of mine have ever seen. And the number of\r\nslaves demanded would--as nearly as I could gather, mean about a third\r\nof the entire population. Further tribute in the form of sufficient\r\nfood to support these slaves is also demanded.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, in God's name, sir,\" burst forth Croy, his eyes blazing, \"by\r\nwhat means do they, propose to inforce their infamous demands?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the power of darkness--and a terrible cataclysm. Their wise\r\nmen--and it would seem that some of them are not unversed in\r\nscience--have discovered a way to unbalance this world, so that they\r\ncan cause darkness to creep over this land that has never known it.\r\nAnd as darkness advances, these people of the sun will be utterly\r\nhelpless before a race that loves darkness, and can see in it like\r\ncats. That, gentlemen, is that fate which confronts this world of\r\nAntri!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a ghastly silence for a moment, and then Croy, always\r\nimpetuous, spoke up again.\r\n\r\n\"How do they propose to do this thing sir?\", he asked hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"With devilish simplicity. They have a great canal dug nearly to the\r\ngreat polar cap of ice. Should they complete it, the hot waters of\r\ntheir seas will be liberated upon this vast ice field, and the warm\r\nwaters will melt it quickly. If you have not forgotten your lessons,\r\ngentlemen, you will remember, since most of you are of Earth, that our\r\nscientists tell us our own world turned over in much this same\r\nfashion, from natural means, and established for itself new poles. Is\r\nthat not true?\"\r\n\r\nGrave, almost frightened nods travelled around the little semicircle\r\nof white, thoughtful faces.\r\n\r\n\"And is there nothing, sir, that we can do?\" asked Kincaide, my second\r\nofficer, in an awed whisper.\r\n\r\n\"That is the purpose of this conclave: to determine what may be done.\r\nWe have our bombs and our rays, it is true, but what is the power of\r\nthis one ship against the people of half a world? And such a people!\"\r\nI shuddered, despite myself, at the memory of that grinning creature\r\nin the cell far below the floor of the council chamber. \"This city,\r\nand its thousands, we might save, it is true--but not the whole half\r\nof this world. And that is the task the Council and its Master have\r\nset before us.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Would it be possible to frighten them?\" asked Croy. \"I gather that\r\nthey are not an advanced race. Perhaps a show of power--the rays--the\r\natomic pistol--bombs-- Call it strategy, sir, or just plain bluff. It\r\nseems the only chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have heard the suggestion, gentlemen,\" I said. \"Has anyone a\r\nbetter?\"\r\n\r\n\"How does Mr. Croy plan to frighten these people of the darkness?\"\r\nasked Kincaide, who was always practical.\r\n\r\n\"By going to their country, in this ship, and then letting events take\r\ntheir course,\" replied Croy promptly. \"Details will have to be settled\r\non the spot, as I see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe Mr. Croy is right,\" I decided. \"The messenger of these\r\npeople must be returned to his own kind; the sooner the better. He has\r\ngiven me a mental map of his country; I believe that it will be\r\npossible for me to locate the principal city, in which his ruler\r\nlives. We will take him there, and then--may God aid us gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen,\" nodded Croy, and the echo of the word ran from lip to lip like\r\nthe prayer it was. \"When do we start?\"\r\n\r\nI hesitated for just an instant.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" I brought forth crisply. \"Immediately. We are gambling with the\r\nfate of a world, a fine and happy people. Let us throw the dice\r\nquickly, for the strain of waiting will not help us. Is that as you\r\nwould wish it, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, sir!\" came the grave chorus.\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Mr. Croy, please report with a detail of ten men, to Bori\r\nTulber, and tell him of our decision. Bring the messenger back with\r\nyou. The rest of you, gentlemen, to your stations. Make any\r\npreparations you may think advisable. Be sure that every available\r\nexterior light is in readiness. Let me be notified the moment the\r\nmessenger is on board and we are ready to take off. Thank you,\r\ngentlemen!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI hastened to my quarters and brought the _Ertak's_ log down to the\r\nminute, explaining in detail the course of action we had decided upon,\r\nand the reasons for it. I knew, as did all the _Ertak's_ officers who\r\nhad saluted so crisply, and so coolly gone about the business of\r\ncarrying out my orders, that we would return from our trip to the dark\r\nside of Antri triumphant or--not at all.\r\n\r\nEven in these soft days, men still respect the stern, proud motto of\r\nour service: \"Nothing Less Than Complete Success.\" The Special Patrol\r\ndoes what it is ordered to do, or no man returns to present excuses.\r\nThat is a tradition to bring tears of pride to the eyes of even an old\r\nman, in whose hands there is strength only for the wielding of a pen.\r\nAnd I was young, in those days.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps a quarter of an hour when word came from the navigating\r\nroom that the messenger was aboard, and we were ready to depart. I\r\nclosed the log, wondering, I remember, if I would ever make another\r\nentry therein, and, if not, whether the words I had just inscribed\r\nwould ever see the light of day. The love of life is strong in men so\r\nyoung. Then I hurried to the navigating room and took charge.\r\n\r\nBori Tulber had furnished me with large scale maps of the daylight\r\nportion of Antri. From the information conveyed to me by the messenger\r\nof the people of darkness--the Chisee they called themselves, as\r\nnearly as I could get the sound--I rapidly sketched in the map of the\r\nother side of Antri, locating their principal city with a small black\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nRealising that the location of the city we sought was only\r\napproximate, we did not bother to work out exact bearings. We set the\r\n_Ertak_ on her course at a height of only a few thousand feet, and set\r\nout at low atmospheric speed, anxiously watching for the dim line of\r\nshadow that marked the twilight zone, and the beginning of what\r\npromised to be the last mission of the _Ertak_ and every man she\r\ncarried within her smooth, gleaming body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Twilight zone in view, sir,\" reported Croy at length.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Croy. Have all the exterior lights and searchlights\r\nturned on. Speed and course as at present, for the time being.\"\r\n\r\nI picked up the twilight zone without difficulty in the television\r\ndisc, and at full power examined the terrain.\r\n\r\nThe rich crops that fairly burst from the earth of the sunlit portion\r\nof Antri were not to be observed here. The Antrians made no effort to\r\ntill this ground, and I doubt that it would have been profitable to do\r\nso, even had they wished to come so close to the darkness they hated.\r\n\r\nThe ground seemed dank, and great dark slugs moved heavily upon its\r\ngreasy surface. Here and there strange pale growths grew in\r\npatches--twisted, spotted growths that seemed somehow unhealthy and\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\nI searched the country ahead, pressing further and further into the\r\nline of darkness that was swiftly approaching. As the light of the sun\r\nfaded, our monstrous searchlights cut into the gloom ahead, their\r\ngreat beams slashing the shadows.\r\n\r\nIn the dark country I had expected to find little if any vegetable\r\ngrowth. Instead, I found that it was a veritable jungle through which\r\neven our searchlight rays could not pass.\r\n\r\nHow tall the growths of this jungle might be, I could not tell, yet I\r\nhad the feeling that they were tall indeed. They were not trees, these\r\npale, weedy arms that reached towards the dark sky. They were soft and\r\npulpy, and without leaves; just long naked sickly arms that divided\r\nand subdivided and ended in little smooth stumps like amputated limbs.\r\n\r\nThat there was some kind of activity within the shelter of this weird\r\njungle, was evident enough, for I could catch glimpses, now and then\r\nof moving things. But what they might be, even the searching eye of\r\nthe television disc could not determine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of our searchlight beams, waving through the darkness like the\r\ncurious antenna of some monstrous insect, came to rest upon a spot far\r\nahead. I followed the beam with the disc, and bent closer, to make\r\nsure my eyes did not deceive me.\r\n\r\nI was looking at a vast cleared place in the pulpy jungle--a cleared\r\nspace in the center of which there was a city.\r\n\r\nA city built of black, sweating stone, each house exactly like every\r\nother house: tall, thin slices of stone, without windows, chimneys or\r\nornamentation of any kind. The only break in the walls was the\r\nslit-like door of each house. Instead of being arranged along streets\r\ncrossing each other at right angles, these houses were built in\r\nconcentric circles broken only by four narrow streets then ran from\r\nthe open space in the center of the city to the four points of the\r\ncompass. Around the entire city was an exceedingly high wall built of\r\nand buttressed with the black, sweating stone of which the houses were\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nThat it was a densely populated city there was ample evidence.\r\nPeople--they were creatures like the messenger; that the Chisee are a\r\npeople, despite their terrible shape, is hardly debatable--were\r\nrunning up and down the four radial streets, and around the curved\r\nconnecting streets, in the wildest confusion, their double-elbowed\r\narms flung across their eyes. But even as I watched, the crowd thinned\r\nand melted swiftly away, until the streets of the queer, circular city\r\nwere utterly deserted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The city ahead is not the one we are seeking, sir?\" asked Croy, who\r\nhad evidently been observing the scene through one of the smaller\r\ntelevision discs. \"I take it that governing city will be farther in\r\nthe interior.\"\r\n\r\n\"According to my rather sketchy information, yes.\" I replied.\r\n\"However, keep all the searchlight operators busy, going over very bit\r\nof the country within the reach of their beams. You have men on all\r\nthe auxiliary television discs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Any findings of interest should be reported to me instantly.\r\nAnd--Mr. Croy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"You might order, if you will, that rations be served all men at their\r\nposts.\" Over such country as this, I felt it would be wise to have\r\nevery man ready for an emergency. It was, perhaps, as well that I\r\nissued this order.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps half an hour after we had passed the circular city\r\nwhen, far ahead, I could see the pale, unhealthy forest thinning out.\r\nA half dozen of our searchlight beams played upon the denuded area,\r\nand as I brought the television disc to bear I saw that we were\r\napproaching a vast swamp, in which little pools of black water\r\nreflected the dazzling light of our searching beams.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. Out of the swamp a thousand strange, winged things\r\nwere rising: yellowish, bat-like things with forked tails and fierce\r\nhooked beaks. And like some obscene miasma from that swamp, they rose\r\nand came straight for the _Ertak_!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstantly I pressed the attention signal that warned every man on the\r\nship.\r\n\r\n\"All disintegrator rays in action at once!\" I barked into the\r\ntransmitter. \"Broad beams, and full energy. Bird-like creatures, dead\r\nahead; do not cease action until ordered!\"\r\n\r\nI heard the disintegrator ray generators deepen their notes before I\r\nfinished speaking, and I smiled grimly, turning to Correy.\r\n\r\n\"Slow down as quickly and as much as possible, Mr. Correy,\" I ordered.\r\n\"We have work to do ahead.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded, and gave the order to the operating room; I felt the\r\nforward surge that told me my order was being obeyed, and turned my\r\nattention again to the television disc.\r\n\r\nThe ray operators were doing their work well. The search lights showed\r\nthe air streaked with fine siftings of greasy dust, and these strange\r\nwinged creatures were disappearing by the scores as the disintegrator\r\nrays beat and played upon them.\r\n\r\nBut they came on gamely, fiercely. Where there had been thousands,\r\nthere were but hundreds ... scores ... dozens....\r\n\r\nThere were only five left. Three of them disappeared at once, but the\r\ntwo remaining came on unhesitatingly, their dirty yellow bat-like\r\nwings flapping heavily, their naked heads outstretched, and hooked\r\nbeaks snapping.\r\n\r\nOne of them disappeared in a little sifting of greasy dust, and the\r\nsame ray dissolved one wing of the remaining creature. He turned over\r\nsuddenly, the one good wing flapping wildly, and tumbled towards the\r\nwaiting swamp that has spawned him. Then, as the ray eagerly followed\r\nhim, the last of that hellish brood disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Circle slowly, Mr. Correy,\" I ordered. I wanted to make sure there\r\nwere none of these terrible creatures left. I felt that nothing so\r\nterrible should be left alive--even in a world of darkness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThrough the television disc I searched the swamp. As I had half\r\nsuspected, the filthy ooze held the young of this race of things:\r\ngrub-like creatures that flipped their heavy bodies about in the\r\nslime, alarmed by the light which searched them out.\r\n\r\n\"All disintegrator rays on the swamp,\" I ordered. \"Sweep it from\r\nmargin to margin. Let nothing be left alive there.\"\r\n\r\nI had a well trained crew. The disintegrator rays massed themselves\r\ninto a marching wall of death, and swept up and down the swamp as a\r\nplough turns its furrows.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to trace their passage, for behind them the swamp\r\ndisappeared, leaving in its stead row after row of broad, dusty paths.\r\nWhen we had finished there was no swamp: there was only a naked area\r\nupon which nothing lived, and upon which, for many years, nothing\r\nwould grow.\r\n\r\n\"Good work,\" I commended the disintegrator ray men. \"Cease action.\"\r\nAnd then, to Correy, \"Put her on her course again, please.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour went by. We passed several more of the strange, damp circular\r\ncities, differing from the first we had seen only in the matter of\r\nsize. Another hour passed, and I became anxious. If we were on our\r\nproper course, and I had understood the Chisee messenger correctly, we\r\nshould be very close to the governing city. We should--\r\n\r\nThe waving beam of one of the searchlights came suddenly to rest.\r\nThree or four other beams followed it--and then all the others.\r\n\r\n\"Large city to port, sir!\" called Croy excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. I believe it is our destination. Cut all searchlights\r\nexcept the forward beam. Mr. Correy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can take her over visually now, I believe. The forward\r\nsearchlight beam will keep our destination in view for you. Set her\r\ndown cautiously in the center of the city in any suitable place.\r\nAnd--remain at the controls ready for any orders, and have the\r\noperating room crew do likewise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Correy crisply.\r\n\r\nWith a tenseness I could not control, I bent over the hooded\r\ntelevision disc and studied the mighty governing city of the Chisee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe governing city of the Chisee was not unlike the others we had\r\nseen, save that it was very much larger, and had eight spoke-like\r\nstreets radiating from its center, instead of four. The protective\r\nwall was both thicker and higher.\r\n\r\nThere was another difference. Instead of a great open space in the\r\ncenter of the city, there was a central, park-like space, in the\r\nmiddle of which was a massive pile, circular in shape, and built, like\r\nall the rest of the city, of the black, sweating rock which seemed to\r\nbe the sole building material of the Chisee.\r\n\r\nWe set the _Ertak_ down close to the big circular building, which we\r\nguessed--and correctly--to be the seat of government. I ordered the\r\nsearchlight ray to be extinguished the moment we landed, and the ethon\r\ntubes that illuminated our ship inside to be turned off, so that we\r\nmight accustom our eyes as much as possible to darkness, finding our\r\nway about with small ethon tube flashlights.\r\n\r\nWith a small guard, I stood at the forward exit of the _Ertak_ and\r\nwatched the huge circular door back out on its mighty threads, and\r\nfinally swing to one side on its massive gimbals. Croy--the only\r\nofficer with me--and I both wore our menores, and carried full\r\nexpeditionary equipment, as did the guard.\r\n\r\nThe Chisee messenger, grimacing and talking excitedly in his sibilant,\r\nwhispering voice, crouched on all fours (he could not stand in that\r\nsmall space) and waited, three men of the guard on either side of him.\r\nI placed his menore on his head and gave him simple, forceful orders,\r\npicturing them for him as best I could:\r\n\r\n\"Go from this place and find others of your kind. Tell them that we\r\nwould speak to them with things such as you have upon your head. Run\r\nswiftly!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will run,\" he conveyed to me, \"to those great ones who sent me.\" He\r\npictured them fleetingly. They were creatures like himself, save that\r\nthey were elaborately dressed in fine skins of several pale colors,\r\nand wore upon their arms, between their two elbows, broad circlets of\r\ncarved metal which I took to be emblems of power or authority, since\r\nthe chief of them all wore a very broad band. Their faces were much\r\nmore intelligent than their messenger had led me to expect, and their\r\neyes, very large and round, and not at all human, were the eyes of\r\nthoughtful, reasoning creatures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDoubled on all fours, the Chisee crept through the circular exit, and\r\nstraightened up. As he did so, from out of the darkness a score or\r\nmore of his fellows rushed up, gathering around him, and blocking the\r\nexit with their reedy legs. We could hear than talking excitedly in\r\nhigh-pitched, squeaky whispers. Then, suddenly I received an\r\nexpression from the Chisee who wore the menore:\r\n\r\n\"Those who are with me have come from those in power. They say one of\r\nyou, and one only, is to come with us to our big men who will learn,\r\nthrough a thing such as I wear upon my head, that which you wish to\r\nsay to them. You are to come quickly; at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will come,\" I replied. \"Have those with you make way--\"\r\n\r\nA heavy hand fell upon my shoulder; a voice spoke eagerly in my ear:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you must not go!\" It was Croy, and his voice shook with feeling.\r\n\"You are in command of the _Ertak_; she, and those in her need you.\r\nLet me go! I insist, sir!\"\r\n\r\nI turned in the darkness, quickly and angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Croy,\" I said swiftly, \"do you realize that you are speaking to\r\nyour commanding officer?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI felt his grip tighten on my arm as the reproof struck home.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said doggedly. \"I do. But I repeat that your duty\r\ncommands you to remain here.\"\r\n\r\n\"The duty of a commander in this Service leads him to the place of\r\ngreatest danger, Mr. Croy,\" I informed him.\r\n\r\n\"Then stay with your ship, sir!\" he pleaded, craftily. \"This may be\r\nsome trick to get you away, so that they may attack us. Please! Can't\r\nyou see that I am right, sir?\"\r\n\r\nI thought swiftly. The earnestness of the youngster had touched me.\r\nBeneath the formality and the \"sirs\" there was a real affection\r\nbetween us.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness I reached for his hand; I found it and shook it\r\nsolemnly--a gesture of Earth which it is hard to explain. It means\r\nmany things.\r\n\r\n\"Go, then, Andy,\" I said softly. \"But do not stay long. An hour at the\r\nlongest. If you are not back in that length of time, we'll come after\r\nyou, and whatever else may happen, you can be sure that you will be\r\nwell avenged. The _Ertak_ has not lost her stinger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, John,\" he replied. \"Remember that I shall wear my menore.\r\nIf I adjust it to full power, and you do likewise, and stand without\r\nthe shelter of the _Ertak's_ metal hull, I shall be able to\r\ncommunicate with you, should there be any danger.\" He pressed my hand\r\nagain, and strode through the exit out into the darkness, which was\r\nlit only by a few distant stars.\r\n\r\nThe long, slim legs closed in around him; like a pigmy guarded by the\r\nskeletons of giants he was led quickly away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe minutes dragged by. There was a nervous tension on the ship, the\r\nlike of which I have experienced not more than a dozen times in all my\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nNo one spoke aloud. Now and again one man would matter uneasily to\r\nanother; there would be a swift, muttered response, and silence again.\r\nWe were waiting--waiting.\r\n\r\nTen minutes went by. Twenty. Thirty.\r\n\r\nImpatiently I paced up and down before the exit, the guards at their\r\nposts, ready to obey any orders instantly.\r\n\r\nForty-five minutes. I walked through the exit; stepped out onto the\r\ncold, hard earth.\r\n\r\nI could see, behind me, the shadowy bulk of the _Ertak_. Before me, a\r\nblack, shapeless blot against the star-sprinkled sky, was the great\r\nadministrative building of the Chisee. And in there, somewhere, was\r\nAnderson Croy. I glanced down at the luminous dial of my watch. Fifty\r\nminutes. In ten minutes more--\r\n\r\n\"John Hanson!\" My name reached me, faintly but clearly, through the\r\nmedium of my menore. \"This is Croy. Do you understand me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied instantly. \"Are you safe?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am safe. All is well. Very well. Will you promise me now to receive\r\nwhat I am about to send, without interruption?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied, thoughtlessly and eagerly. \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I have had a long conference with the chief or head of the Chisee,\"\r\nexplained Croy rapidly. \"He is very intelligent, and his people are\r\nmuch further advanced than we thought.\r\n\r\n\"Through some form of communication, he has learned of the fight with\r\nthe weird birds; it seems that they are--or were--the most dreaded of\r\nall the creatures of this dark world. Apparently we got the whole\r\nbrood of them, and this chief, whose name, I gather, is Wieschien, or\r\nsomething like that, is naturally much impressed.\r\n\r\n\"I have given him a demonstration or two with my atomic pistol and the\r\nflashlight--these people are fairly stricken by a ray of light\r\ndirectly in the eyes--and we have reached very favorable terms.\r\n\r\n\"I am to remain here as chief bodyguard and adviser, of which he has\r\nneed, for all is not peaceful, I gather, in this kingdom of darkness.\r\nIn return, he is to give up his plans to subjugate the rest of Antri;\r\nhe has sworn to do this by what is evidently, to him, a very sacred\r\noath, witnessed solemnly by the rest of his council.\r\n\r\n\"Under the circumstances, I believe he will do what he says; in any\r\ncase, the great canal will be filled in, and the Antrians will have\r\nplenty of time to erect a great series of disintegrator ray stations\r\nalong the entire twilight zone, using the broad fan rays to form a\r\nsolid wall against which the Chisee could not advance even did they,\r\nat some future date, carry out their plans. The worst possible result\r\nthen would be that the people in the sunlit portion would have to\r\nmigrate from certain sections, and perhaps would have day and night,\r\nalternately, as do other worlds.\r\n\r\n\"This is the agreement we have reached; it is the only one that will\r\nsave this world. Do you approve, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! Return immediately, and we will show the Chisee that they cannot\r\nhold an officer of the Special Patrol as a hostage. Make haste!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It's no go, sir,\" came the reply instantly. \"I threatened them first.\r\nI explained what our disintegrator rays would do, and Wieschien\r\nlaughed at me.\r\n\r\n\"This city is built upon great subterranean passages that lead to many\r\nhidden exits. If we show the least sign of hostility the work will be\r\nresumed on the canal, and, before we can locate the spot, and stop the\r\nwork, the damage will be done.\r\n\r\n\"This is our only chance, sir, to make this expedition a complete\r\nsuccess. Permit me to judge this fact from the evidence I have before\r\nme. Whatever sacrifice there is to make, I make gladly. Wieschien asks\r\nthat you depart at once, and in peace, and I know this is the only\r\ncourse. Good-by, sir; convey my salutations to my other friends upon\r\nthe old _Ertak_, and elsewhere. And now, lest my last act as an\r\nofficer of the Special Patrol Service be to refuse to obey the\r\ncommands of my superior officer, I am removing the menore. Good-by!\"\r\n\r\nI tried to reach him again, but there was no response.\r\n\r\nGone! He was gone! Swallowed up in darkness and in silence!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDazed, shaken to the very foundation of my being, I stood there\r\nbetween the shadowy bulk of the _Ertak_ and the towering mass of the\r\ngreat silent pile that was the seat of government in this strange land\r\nof darkness, and gazed up at the dark sky above me. I am not ashamed,\r\nnow, to say that hot tears trickled down my cheeks, nor that as I\r\nturned back to the _Ertak_, my throat was so gripped by emotion that I\r\ncould not speak.\r\n\r\nI ordered the exit closed with a wave of my hand; in the navigating\r\nroom I said but four words: \"We depart at once.\"\r\n\r\nAt the third meal of the day I gathered my officers about me and told\r\nthem, as quickly and as gently as I could, of the sacrifice one of\r\ntheir number had made.\r\n\r\nIt was Kincaide who, when I had finished, rose slowly and made reply.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" he said quietly, \"We had a friend. Some day, he might have\r\ndied. Now he will live forever in the records of the Service, in the\r\nmemory of a world, and in the hearts of those who had the honor to\r\nserve with him. Could he--or we--wish more?\"\r\n\r\nAmid a strange silence he sat down again, and there was not an eye\r\namong us that was dry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI hope that the snappy young officer who visited me the other day\r\nreads this little account of bygone times.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will make clear to him how we worked, in those nearly\r\nforgotten days, with the tools we had at hand. They were not the\r\nperfect tools of to-day, but what they lacked, we somehow made up.\r\n\r\nThat fine old motto of the Service, \"Nothing Less Than Complete\r\nSuccess,\" we passed on unsullied to those who came after us.\r\n\r\nI hope these youngsters of to-day may do as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _IN THE NEXT ISSUE_\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE TENTACLES FROM BELOW\r\n\r\n      _A Complete Novelette of An American Submarine's Dramatic\r\n         Raid on Marauding \"Machine-Fish\" of the Ocean Floor_\r\n\r\n                          By Anthony Gilmore\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PHALANXES OF ATLANS\r\n\r\n               _Beginning a Thrilling Two-Part Novel of\r\n                    a Strange Hidden Civilisation_\r\n\r\n                          By F.

Thompson Rich_\r\n\r\n    Concerning the strange adventures of Professor Stevens with\r\n    the Antillians on the floors of the mysterious Sargasso Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then you really expect to find the lost continent of Atlantis,\r\nProfessor?\"\r\n\r\nMartin Stevens lifted his bearded face sternly to the reporter who was\r\ninterviewing him in his study aboard the torpedo-submarine _Nereid_, a\r\ncraft of his own invention, as she lay moored at her Brooklyn wharf,\r\non an afternoon in October.\r\n\r\n\"My dear young man,\" he said, \"I am not even going to look for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe aspiring journalist--Larry Hunter by name--was properly abashed.\r\n\r\n\"But I thought,\" he insisted nevertheless, \"that you said you were\r\ngoing to explore the ocean floor under the Sargasso Sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"And so I did.\" Professor Stevens admitted, a smile moving that gray\r\nbeard now and his blue eyes twinkling merrily. \"But the Sargasso, an\r\narea almost equal to Europe, covers other land as well--land of far\r\nmore recent submergence than Atlantis, which foundered in 9564 B. C.,\r\naccording to Plato. What I am going to look for is this newer lost\r\ncontinent, or island rather--namely, the great island of Antillia, of\r\nwhich the West Indies remain above water to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Antillia?\" queried Larry Hunter, wonderingly. \"I never heard of it.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the professor regarded his interviewer sternly.\r\n\r\n\"There are many things you have never heard of, young man,\" he told\r\nhim. \"Antillia may be termed the missing link between Atlantis and\r\nAmerica. It was there that Atlantean culture survived after the\r\nappalling catastrophe that wiped out the Atlantean homeland, with its\r\nseventy million inhabitants, and it was in the colonies the Antillians\r\nestablished in Mexico and Peru, that their own culture in turn\r\nsurvived, after Antillia too had sunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Lord! You don't mean to say the Mayas and Incas originated on that\r\nisland of Antillia?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I mean to say they originated on the continent of Atlantis, and\r\nthat Antillia was the stepping stone to the New World, where they\r\nbuilt the strange pyramids we find smothered in the jungle--even as\r\nthousands of years before the Atlanteans established colonies in Egypt\r\nand founded the earliest dynasties of pyramid-building Pharaohs.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLarry was pushing his pencil furiously.\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" he gasped. \"Some story, Professor!\"\r\n\r\n\"To the general public, perhaps,\" was the reply. \"But to scholars of\r\nantiquity, these postulates are pretty well known and pretty well\r\naccepted. It remains but to get concrete evidence, in order to prove\r\nthem to the world at large--and that is the object of my expedition.\"\r\n\r\nMore hurried scribbling, then:\r\n\r\n\"But, say--why don't you go direct to Atlantis and get the real dope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because that continent foundered so long ago that it is doubtful if\r\nany evidence would have withstood the ravages of time,\" Professor\r\nStevens explained, \"whereas Antillia went down no earlier than 200 B.\r\nC., archaeologists agree.\"\r\n\r\n\"That answers my question,\" declared Larry, his admiration for this\r\ndoughty graybeard rising momentarily. \"And now, Professor, I wonder if\r\nyou'd be willing to say a few words about this craft of yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheerfully, if you think it would interest anyone. What would you\r\ncare to have me say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, in the first place, what does the name _Nereid_ mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sea-nymph. The derivation is from the Latin and Greek, meaning\r\ndaughter of the sea-god Nereus. Appropriate, don't you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Swell. And why do you call it a torpedo-submarine? How does it differ\r\nfrom the common or navy variety?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Stevens smiled. It was like asking what was the difference\r\nbetween the sun and the moon, when about the only point of resemblance\r\nthey had was that they were both round. Nevertheless, he enumerated\r\nsome of the major modifications he had developed.\r\n\r\nAmong them, perhaps the most radical, was its motive power, which was\r\nproduced by what he called a vacuo-turbine--a device that sucked in\r\nthe water at the snout of the craft and expelled it at the tail, at\r\nthe time purifying a certain amount for drinking purposes and\r\nextracting sufficient oxygen to maintain a healthful atmosphere while\r\nrunning submerged.\r\n\r\nThen, the structure of the _Nereid_ was unique, he explained,\r\npermitting it to attain depths where the pressure would crush an\r\nordinary submarine, while mechanical eyes on the television principle\r\nafforded a view in all directions, and locks enabling them to leave\r\nthe craft at will and explore the sea-bottom were provided.\r\n\r\nThis latter feat they would accomplish in special suits, designed on\r\nthe same pneumatic principle as the torpedo itself and capable of\r\nsustaining sufficient inflation to resist whatever pressures might be\r\nencountered, as well as being equipped with vibratory sending and\r\nreceiving apparatus, for maintaining communication with those left\r\naboard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll these things and more Professor Stevens outlined, as Larry's\r\npencil flew, admitting that he had spent the past ten years and the\r\nbest part of his private fortune in developing his plans.\r\n\r\n\"But you'll get it all back, won't you? Aren't there all sorts of\r\nSpanish galleons and pirate barques laden with gold supposed to be\r\ndown there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" was the calm reply. \"But I am not on a treasure hunt,\r\nyoung man. If I find one single sign of former life, I shall be amply\r\nrewarded.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the young reporter regarded the subject of his interview\r\nwith fresh admiration, not unmingled with wonder. In his own hectic\r\nworld, people had no such scorn of gold. Gee, he'd sure like to go\r\nalong! The professor could have his old statues or whatever he was\r\nlooking for. As for himself, he'd fill up his pockets with Spanish\r\ndoubloons and pieces of eight!\r\n\r\nLarry was snapped out of his trance by a light knock on the door,\r\nwhich opened to admit a radiant girl in creamy knickers and green\r\ncardigan.\r\n\r\n\"May I come in, daddy?\" she inquired, hesitating, as she saw he was\r\nnot alone.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be in already, my dear,\" the professor told her, rising\r\nfrom his desk and stepping forward.\r\n\r\nThen, turning to Larry, who had also risen, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hunter, this is my daughter, Diane, who is also my secretary.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am pleased to meet you, Miss Stevens,\" said Larry, taking her hand.\r\n\r\nAnd he meant it--for almost anyone would have been pleased to meet\r\nDiane, with her tawny gold hair, warm olive cheeks and eyes bluer even\r\nthan her father's and just as twinkling, just as intelligent.\r\n\r\n\"She will accompany the expedition and take stenographic notes of\r\neverything we observe,\" added her father, to Larry's amazement.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" he declared. \"You mean to say that--that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course he means to say that I'm going, if that's what you mean to\r\nsay, Mr. Hunter,\" Diane assured him. \"Can you think of any good reason\r\nwhy I shouldn't go, when girls are flying around the world and\r\neverything else?\"\r\n\r\nEven had Larry been able to think of any good reason, he wouldn't have\r\nmentioned it. But as a matter of fact, he had shifted quite abruptly\r\nto an entirely different line of thought. Diane, he was\r\nthinking--Diana, goddess of the chase, the huntress! And himself,\r\nLarry Hunter--the hunter and the huntress!\r\n\r\nGee, but he'd like to go! What an adventure, hunting around together\r\non the bottom of the ocean!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat a wild dream, rather, he concluded when his senses returned. For\r\nafter all, he was only a reporter, fated to write about other people's\r\nadventures, not to participate in them. So he put away his pad and\r\npencil and prepared to leave.\r\n\r\nBut at the door he paused.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes--one more question. When are you planning to leave,\r\nProfessor?\"\r\n\r\nAt that, Martin Stevens and his daughter exchanged a swift glance.\r\nThen, with a smile, Diane said:\r\n\r\n\"I see no reason why we shouldn't tell him, daddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we didn't tell the reporters from the other papers, my dear,\"\r\nprotested her father.\r\n\r\n\"Then suppose we give Mr. Hunter the exclusive story,\" she said,\r\ntransferring her smile to Larry now. \"It will be what you call a--a\r\nscoop. Isn't that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it.\"\r\n\r\nShe caught her father's acquiescing nod. \"Then here's your scoop, Mr.\r\nHunter. We leave to-night.\"\r\n\r\nTo-night! This was indeed a scoop! If he hurried, he could catch the\r\nlate afternoon editions with it.\r\n\r\n\"I--I certainly thank you, Miss Stevens!\" he exclaimed. \"That'll make\r\nthe front page!\"\r\n\r\nAs he grasped the door-knob, he added, turning to her father:\r\n\r\n\"And I want to thank you too, Professor--and wish you good luck!\"\r\n\r\nThen, with a hasty handshake, and a last smile of gratitude for Diane,\r\nhe flung open the door and departed, unconscious that two young blue\r\neyes followed his broad shoulders wistfully till they disappeared from\r\nview.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut Larry was unaware that he had made a favorable impression on\r\nDiane. He felt it was the reverse. As he headed toward the subway,\r\nthat vivid blond goddess of the chase was uppermost in his thoughts.\r\n\r\nSoon she'd be off in the _Nereid_, bound for the mysterious regions\r\nunder the Sargasso Sea, while in a few moments he'd be in the subway,\r\nbound under the prosaic East River for New York.\r\n\r\nNo--damned if he would!\r\n\r\nSuddenly, with a wild inspiration, the young reporter altered his\r\ncourse, dove into the nearest phone booth and got his city editor on\r\nthe wire.\r\n\r\nScoop? This was just the first installment. He'd get a scoop that\r\nwould fill a book!\r\n\r\nAnd his city editor tacitly O. K.'d the idea.\r\n\r\nWith the result that when the _Nereid_ drew away from her wharf that\r\nnight, on the start of her unparalleled voyage, Larry Hunter was a\r\nstowaway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe place where he had succeeded in secreting himself was a small\r\nstoreroom far aft, on one of the lower decks. There he huddled in the\r\ndarkness, while the slow hours wore away, hearing only the low hum of\r\nthe craft's vacuo-turbine and the flux of water running through her.\r\n\r\nFrom the way she rolled and pitched, he judged she was still\r\nproceeding along on the surface.\r\n\r\nHaving eaten before he came aboard, he felt no hunger, but the close\r\nair and the dark quarters brought drowsiness. He slept.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke it was still dark, of course, but a glance at his\r\nluminous wrist-watch told him it was morning now. And the fact that\r\nthe rolling and pitching had ceased made him believe they were now\r\nrunning submerged.\r\n\r\nThe urge for breakfast asserting itself, Larry drew a bar of chocolate\r\nfrom his pocket and munched on it. But this was scanty fare for a\r\nhealthy young six-footer, accustomed to a liberal portion of ham and\r\neggs. Furthermore, the lack of coffee made him realize that he was\r\ngetting decidedly thirsty. The air, moreover, was getting pretty bad.\r\n\r\n\"All in all, this hole wasn't exactly intended for a bedroom!\" he\r\nreflected with a wry smile.\r\n\r\nTaking a chance, he opened the door a crack and sat there impatiently,\r\nwhile the interminable minutes ticked off.\r\n\r\nThe _Nereid's_ turbine was humming now with a high, vibrant note that\r\nindicated they must be knocking off the knots at a lively clip. He\r\nwondered how far out they were, and how far down.\r\n\r\nLord, there'd be a riot when he showed up! He wanted to wait till they\r\nwere far enough on their way so it would be too much trouble to turn\r\naround and put him ashore.\r\n\r\nBut by noon his powers of endurance were exhausted. Flinging open the\r\ndoor, he stepped out into the corridor, followed it to a companionway\r\nand mounted the ladder to the deck above.\r\n\r\nThere he was assailed by a familiar and welcome odor--food!\r\n\r\nTrailing it to its origin, he came to a pair of swinging doors at the\r\nend of a cork-paved passage. Beyond, he saw on peering through, was\r\nthe mess-room, and there at the table, among a number of uniformed\r\nofficers, sat Professor Stevens and Diane.\r\n\r\nA last moment Larry stood there, looking in on them. Then, drawing a\r\ndeep breath, he pushed wide the swinging doors and entered with a\r\ncheery:\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, folks! Hope I'm not too late for lunch!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVarying degrees of surprise greeted this dramatic appearance. The\r\nofficers stared, Diane gasped, her father leaped to has feet with a\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n\"That reporter! Why--why, what are you doing here, young man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just representing the press.\"\r\n\r\nLarry tried to make it sound nonchalant but he was finding it\r\ndifficult to bear up under this barrage of disapproving\r\neyes--particularly two very young, very blue ones.\r\n\r\n\"So that is the way you reward us for giving you an exclusive story,\r\nis it?\" Professor Stevens' voice was scathing. \"A representative of\r\nthe press! A stowaway, rather--and as such you will be treated!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to one of his officers.\r\n\r\n\"Report to Captain Petersen that we have a stowaway aboard and order\r\nhim to put about at once.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to another.\r\n\r\n\"See that Mr. Hunter is taken below and locked up. When we reach New\r\nYork, he will be handed over to the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"But daddy!\" protested Diane, as they rose to comply, her eyes\r\nsoftening now. \"We shouldn't be too severe with Mr. Hunter. After all,\r\nhe is probably doing only what his paper ordered him to.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGratefully Larry turned toward his defender. But he couldn't let that\r\npass.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm acting only on my own initiative,\" he said. \"No one told me\r\nto come.\"\r\n\r\nFor he couldn't get his city editor involved, and after all it was his\r\nown idea.\r\n\r\n\"You see!\" declared Professor Stevens. \"He admits it is his own doing.\r\nIt is clear he has exceeded his authority, therefore, and deserves no\r\nsympathy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can't you let me stay, now that I'm here?\" urged Larry. \"I know\r\nsomething about boats. I'll serve as a member of the crew--anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible. We have a full complement. You would be more of a\r\nhindrance than a help. Besides, I do not care to have the possible\r\nresults of this expedition blared before the public.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll write nothing you do not approve.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no time to edit your writings, young man. My own, will occupy\r\nme sufficiently. So it is useless. You are only wasting your\r\nbreath--and mine.\"\r\n\r\nHe motioned for his officers to carry out his orders.\r\n\r\nBut before they could move to do so, in strode a lean, middle-aged\r\nNorwegian Larry sensed must be Captain Petersen himself, and on his\r\nweathered face was an expression of such gravity that it was obvious\r\nto everyone something serious had happened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIgnoring Larry, after one brief look of inquiry that was answered by\r\nProfessor Stevens, he reported swiftly what he had to say.\r\n\r\nWhile cruising full speed at forty fathoms, with kite-aerial out,\r\ntheir wireless operator had received a radio warning to turn back.\r\nAnswering on its call-length, he had demanded to know the sender and\r\nthe reason for the message, but the information had been declined, the\r\nwarning merely being repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Was it a land station or a ship at sea?\" asked the professor.\r\n\r\n\"Evidently the latter,\" was the reply. \"By our radio range-finder, we\r\ndetermined the position at approximately latitude 27, longitude 65.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that, Captain, is in the very area we are headed for.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that, Professor, makes it all the more singular.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--well, well! This is indeed peculiar! And I had been on the point\r\nof turning back with our impetuous young stowaway. What would you\r\nsuggest, sir?\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Petersen meditated, while Larry held his breath.\r\n\r\n\"To turn back,\" he said at length, in his clear, precise English,\r\n\"would in my opinion be to give the laugh to someone whose sense of\r\nhumor is already too well developed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\" agreed Professor Stevens, as Larry relaxed in relief.\r\n\"Whoever this practical joker is, we will show him he is wasting his\r\ntalents--even though it means carrying a supernumerary for the rest of\r\nthe voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well spoken!\" said the captain. \"But as far as that is concerned, I\r\nthink I can keep Mr. Hunter occupied.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then take him, and welcome!\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon, still elated but now somewhat uneasy, Larry accompanied\r\nCaptain Petersen from the mess-room; started to, that is. But at a\r\nglance of sympathy from Diane, he dared call out:\r\n\r\n\"Say--hold on, folks! I haven't had lunch yet!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen young Larry Hunter reported to the captain of the _Nereid_, after\r\nthis necessary meal, he found that the craft had returned to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nAssigned a pair of powerful binoculars, he was ordered to stand watch\r\nin the conning-tower and survey the horizon in every direction, in an\r\neffort to sight the vessel that had sent out that mysterious radio,\r\nbut though he cast his good brown eyes diligently through those strong\r\nlenses, he saw not so much as a smoke tuft upon the broad, gray-blue\r\nsurface of the hazy Atlantic.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, as the afternoon wore away, something else came in\r\nview. Masses of brownish seaweed, supported by small, berry-like\r\nbladders, began drifting by. Far apart at first, they began getting\r\nmore and more dense, till at last, with a thrill, he realized that\r\nthey were drawing into that strange area known as the Sargasso Sea.\r\n\r\nShortly after this realization dawned, he was ordered below, and as\r\nthe tropic sun was sinking over that eery floating tombstone, which\r\naccording to Professor Stevens marked a nation's grave, the _Nereid_\r\nsubmerged.\r\n\r\nDown she slid, a hundred fathoms or more, on a long, even glide that\r\ntook her deep under that veiling brown blanket.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the navigating room now, Larry stood with the captain, the\r\nprofessor and Diane, studying an illuminated panel on which appeared a\r\ncross of five squares, like a box opened out.\r\n\r\nThe central square reproduced the scene below, while those to left and\r\nright depicted it from port and starboard, and those to front and rear\r\nrevealed the forward and aft aspects of the panorama, thus affording a\r\nclear view in every direction.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the television device Professor Stevens had referred\r\nto the previous afternoon, its mechanical eyes enabling then to search\r\nevery square inch of those mysterious depths, as they cruised along.\r\n\r\nIt was the central square that occupied their attention chiefly,\r\nhowever, as they stood studying the panel. While the others\r\nrepresented merely an unbroken vista of greenish water, this one\r\nshowed the sea floor as clearly as though they had been peering down\r\ninto a shallow lagoon through a glass-bottomed boat, though it must\r\nhave been a quarter of a mile below their cruising level.\r\n\r\nA wonderful and fearsome sight it was to Larry: like something seen in\r\na nightmare--a fantastic desert waste of rocks and dunes, with here\r\nand there a yawning chasm whose ominous depths their ray failed to\r\npenetrate, and now and then a jutting plateau that would appear on the\r\nforward square and cause Captain Petersen to elevate their bow\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\nBut more thrilling than this was their first glimpse of a sunken\r\nship--a Spanish galleon, beyond a doubt!\r\n\r\nThere she lay, grotesquely on her side, half rotted, half buried in\r\nthe sand, but still discernible. And to Larry's wildly racing\r\nimagination, a flood of gold and jewels seemed to pour from her ruined\r\ncoffers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTurning to Diane, he saw that her eyes too were flashing with intense\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"Say!\" he exclaimed. \"Why don't we stop and look her over? There may\r\nbe a fortune down there!\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Stevens promptly vetoed the suggestion, however.\r\n\r\n\"I must remind you, young man,\" he said severely, \"that this is not a\r\ntreasure hunt.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Larry subsided; outwardly, at least. But when presently the\r\ncentral square revealed another and then another sunken ship, it was\r\nall he could do to contain himself.\r\n\r\nNow, suddenly, Diane cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, daddy, look! There's a modern ship! A--a freighter, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A collier, I would say,\" was her father's calm reply. \"Rather a large\r\none, too. _Cyclops_, possibly. She disappeared some years ago, en\r\nroute from the Barbados to Norfolk. Or possibly it is any one of a\r\ndozen other steel vessels that have vanished from these seas in recent\r\ntimes. The area of the Sargasso, my dear, is known as 'The Port of\r\nMissing Ships.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But couldn't we drop down and make sure which ship it is?\" she\r\npleaded, voicing the very thought Larry had been struggling to\r\nsuppress.\r\n\r\nAt the professor's reply, however, he was glad he had kept quiet.\r\n\r\n\"We could, of course,\" was his gentle though firm rebuke, \"but if we\r\nstopped to solve the mystery of every sunken ship we shall probably\r\nsee during this cruise, we would have time for nothing else.\r\nNevertheless, my dear, you may take a short memorandum of the location\r\nand circumstances, in the present instance.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon he dictated briefly, while Larry devoted his attention once\r\nmore to the central square.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly, beyond a dark pit that seemed to reach down into the very\r\nbowels of the earth, rose an abrupt plateau--and on one of its nearer\r\nelevations, almost directly under then, loomed a monumental four-sided\r\nmound.\r\n\r\n\"Say--hold on!\" called Larry. \"Look at that, Professor! Isn't that a\r\nbuilding of some kind?\"\r\n\r\nMartin Stevens looked up, glanced skeptically toward the panel. But\r\none glimpse at what that central square revealed, and his skepticism\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n\"A building?\" he cried in triumph. \"A building indeed! It is a\r\npyramid, young man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, daddy! Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beyond a doubt! And look--there are two other similar structures,\r\nonly smaller!\"\r\n\r\nStruggling for calm, he turned to Captain Petersen, who had taken his\r\neyes from the forward square and was peering down as well upon those\r\nsingular mounds.\r\n\r\n\"Stop! Descend!\" was his exultant command. \"This is my proof! We have\r\ndiscovered Antillia!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSwiftly the _Nereid_ dropped to that submerged plateau.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes, her keel was resting evenly on the smooth sand beside\r\nthe largest of the three pyramids.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stevens then announced that he would make a preliminary\r\ninvestigation of the site at once.\r\n\r\n\"For, otherwise, I for one would be quite unable to sleep tonight!\"\r\ndeclared the graybeard, with a boyish chuckle.\r\n\r\nHe added that Diane would accompany him.\r\n\r\nAt this latter announcement, Larry's heart sank. He had hoped against\r\nhope that he might be invited along with them.\r\n\r\nBut once again his champion came to his aid.\r\n\r\n\"We really ought to let Mr. Hunter come with us, daddy, don't you\r\nthink?\" she urged, noting his disappointment. \"After all, it was he\r\nwho made the discovery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" said her father, \"but I had not thought it necessary for\r\nanyone to accompany us. In the event anyone does, Captain Petersen\r\nshould have that honor.\"\r\n\r\nBut this honor the captain declined.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't mind, sir, I'd prefer to stay with the ship,\" he said,\r\nquietly. \"I haven't forgotten that radio warning.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely you don't think anyone can molest us down here?\" scoffed\r\nthe professor.\r\n\r\n\"No, but I'd prefer to stay with the ship just the same, sir, if you\r\ndon't mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well\"--with a touch of pique. \"Then you may come along if you\r\ncare to, Mr. Hunter.\"\r\n\r\nIf he cared to!\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Professor!\" he said with a grateful look toward Diane. \"I'd\r\nbe keen to!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo he accompanied them below, where they donned their\r\npressure-suits--rubber affairs rather less cumbersome than ordinary\r\ndeep-sea diving gear, reinforced with steel wire and provided with\r\nthick glass goggles and powerful searchlights, in addition to their\r\nvibratory communication apparatus and other devices that were\r\nexplained to Larry.\r\n\r\nWhen he had mastered their operation, which was rendered simple by\r\nreason of the fact that they were so nearly automatic, the trio\r\nstepped into a lock on the floor of the ship and Professor Stevens\r\nordered them to couple their suits to air-valve connections on the\r\nwall, at the same time admitting water by opening another valve.\r\n\r\nSwiftly the lock flooded, while their suits inflated.\r\n\r\n\"All right?\" came his vibratory query.\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" they both answered.\r\n\r\n\"Then stand by for the heavy pressure.\"\r\n\r\nWider now he opened the water-valve, letting the ocean in, while at\r\nthe same time their suits continued inflating through their air-valve\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise, Larry found himself no more inconvenienced by the\r\npressure than he had been from the moment the submarine dove to its\r\npresent depth. Indeed, most of the air that was coming into his suit\r\nwas filling the reinforced space between its inner and outer layers,\r\nmuch as the _Nereid_ held air under pressure between her two thick\r\nshells.\r\n\r\n\"All right now?\" called out the professor's vibrator.\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" they called back again.\r\n\r\n\"Then uncouple your air-valve connections and make ready.\"\r\n\r\nThey did so; and he likewise.\r\n\r\nThen, advancing to a massive door like that of a vault, he flung back\r\nits powerful clamps, dragged it open--and there beyond, its pressure\r\nequaled by that within the lock, loomed the black tide of the ocean\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAwed by this solemn sight, tingling with a sense of unparalleled\r\nadventure, Larry stood there a moment, peering out over the threshold\r\nof that untrodden world.\r\n\r\nThen he followed Diane and her father into its beckoning mystery....\r\n\r\nTheir searchlights cutting bright segments into the dark, they\r\nproceeded toward the vast mound that towered ahead, pushing through a\r\nweird realm of phosphorescent fish and other marine creatures.\r\n\r\nAs they neared it, any possible doubt that it was in fact a pyramid\r\nvanished. Corroded by the action of salt water and covered with the\r\nincrustations of centuries, it nevertheless presented unmistakable\r\nevidence of human construction, rising in steps of massive masonry to\r\na summit shadowy in the murk above.\r\n\r\nAs Larry stood gazing upon that mighty proof that this submerged\r\nplateau had once stood forth proudly above the sea, he realized that\r\nhe was a party to one of the most profound discoveries of the ages.\r\nWhat a furore this would make when he reported it back to his New York\r\npaper!\r\n\r\nBut New York seemed remote indeed, now. Would they ever get back? What\r\nif anything went wrong with their pressure-suits--or if they should\r\nbecome lost?\r\n\r\nHe glanced back uneasily, but there gleamed the reassuring lights of\r\nthe _Nereid_, not a quarter of a mile away.\r\n\r\nDiane and her father were now rounding a corner of the pyramid and he\r\nfollowed them, his momentary twinge of anxiety gone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor some moments, Professor Stevens prowled about without comment,\r\nexamining the huge basal blocks of the structure and glancing up its\r\nsloping sides.\r\n\r\n\"You see, I was right!\" he declared at length. \"This is not only a\r\nman-made edifice but a true pyramid, embodying the same architectural\r\nprinciples as the Mayan and Egyptian forms. We see before us the\r\nvisible evidence of a sunken empire--the missing link between Atlantis\r\nand America.\"\r\n\r\nNo comments greeted this profound announcement and the professor\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"This structure appears to be similar in dimensions with that of the\r\npyramid of Xochicalco, in Mexico, which in turn approximates that of\r\nthe \"Sacred Hill\" of Atlantis, mentioned by Plato, and which was the\r\nprototype of both the Egyptian and Mayan forms. It was here the\r\nAntillians, as the Atlanteans had taught them to do, worshipped their\r\ngrim gods and performed the human sacrifices they thought necessary to\r\nappease them. And it was here, too, if I am not mistaken, that--\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly his vibratory discourse was broken into by a sharp signal\r\nfrom the submarine:\r\n\r\n\"Pardon interruption! Hurry back! We are attacked!\"\r\n\r\nAt this, the trio stood rigid.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Petersen! Captain Petersen!\" Larry heard the professor call.\r\n\"Speak up! Give details! What has happened?\"\r\n\r\nBut an ominous silence greeted the query.\r\n\r\nAnother moment they stood there, thoroughly dismayed now. Then came\r\nthe professor's swift command:\r\n\r\n\"Follow me--quickly!\"\r\n\r\nHe was already in motion, retracing his steps as fast as his bulky\r\nsuit would permit. But as he rounded the corner of the pyramid, they\r\nsaw him pause, stand staring. And as they drew up, they in turn\r\npaused; stood staring, too.\r\n\r\nWith sinking hearts, they saw that the _Nereid_ was gone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStunned by this disaster, they stood facing one another--three lone\r\nhuman beings, on the bottom of the Atlantic ocean, their sole means of\r\nsalvation gone.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stevens was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\"This is unbelievable!\" he said. \"I cannot credit it. We must have\r\nlost our senses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or our bearings!\" added Diane, more hopefully. \"Suppose we look\r\naround the other side.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Larry, a darker suspicion flashed through his mind. Captain\r\nPetersen! Had he seized his opportunity and led the crew to mutiny, in\r\nthe hope of converting the expedition into a treasure hunt? Was that\r\nthe reason he had been so willing to remain behind?\r\n\r\nHe kept his suspicion to himself, however, and accompanied Diane and\r\nher father on a complete circuit of the pyramid; but, as he feared,\r\nthere was no sign of the _Nereid_ anywhere. The craft had vanished as\r\ncompletely as though the ocean floor had opened and swallowed her up.\r\n\r\nBut no, not as completely as that! For presently the professor, who\r\nhad proceeded to the site where they left the craft resting on the\r\nsand, called out excitedly:\r\n\r\n\"Here--come here! There are tracks! Captain Petersen was right! They\r\nwere attacked!\"\r\n\r\nHurrying to the scene, they saw before them the plain evidences of a\r\nstruggle. The ocean bottom was scuffed and stamped, as though by many\r\nfeet, and a clear trail showed where the craft had finally been\r\ndragged away.\r\n\r\nObviously there was but one thing to do and they did it. After a brief\r\nconference, they turned and followed the trail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt led off over the plateau a quarter mile or more, in an eastward\r\ndirection, terminating at length beside one of the smaller\r\npyramids--and there lay the _Nereid_, apparently unharmed.\r\n\r\nBut her lights were out and there came no answer to their repeated\r\ncalls, so they judged she must be empty.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened to Captain Petersen and his crew? What strange\r\nsub-sea enemy had overcome them? What was now their fate?\r\n\r\nUnanswerable question! But one thing was certain. Larry had misjudged\r\nthe captain in suspecting him of mutiny. He was sorry for this and\r\nresolved he would make amends by doing all in his power to rescue him\r\nand his men, if they were still living.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his own plight, and that of Diane and her father, was\r\ncritical. What was to be done?\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as all three stood there debating that question, Professor\r\nStevens uttered an exclamation and strode toward the pyramid.\r\nFollowing him with their eyes, they saw him pass through an aperture\r\nwhere a huge block of stone had been displaced--and disappear within.\r\n\r\nThe next moment they had joined him, to find themselves in a small\r\nflooded chamber at whose far end a narrow gallery sloped upward at a\r\nsharp angle.\r\n\r\nThe floor and walls were tiled, they noted, and showed none of the\r\ncorrosion of the exterior surfaces. Indeed, so immaculate was the room\r\nthat it might have been occupied but yesterday.\r\n\r\nAs they stood gazing around in wonder, scarcely daring to draw the\r\nnatural inferences of this phenomena, there came a rasping sound, and,\r\nturning toward the entrance, they saw a massive section of masonry\r\ndescend snugly into place.\r\n\r\nThey were trapped!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStanding there tense, speechless, they waited, wondering what would be\r\nthe next move of this strange enemy who held them now so surely in his\r\npower.\r\n\r\nNor had they long to wait.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately, there issued a gurgling sound from the inclined\r\ngallery, and turning their eyes in the direction of this new\r\nphenomena, they saw that the water level was receding, as though under\r\npressure from above.\r\n\r\n\"Singular!\" muttered Professor Stevens. \"A sort of primitive lock. It\r\nseems incredible that human creatures could exist down here, but such\r\nappears to be the case.\"\r\n\r\nLarry had no desire to dispute the assumption, nor had Diane. They\r\nstood there as people might in the imminence of the supernatural,\r\nawaiting they knew not what.\r\n\r\nSwiftly the water receded.\r\n\r\nNow it was scarcely up to their waists, now plashing about their\r\nankles, and now the room was empty.\r\n\r\nThe next moment, there sounded a rush of feet--and down the gallery\r\ncame a swarm of the strangest beings any of them had ever seen.\r\n\r\nThey were short, thin, almost emaciated, with pale, pinched faces and\r\npasty, half-naked bodies. But they shimmered with ornaments of gold\r\nand jade, like some strange princes from the realm of Neptune--or\r\nrather, like Aztec chieftains of the days of Cortes, thought Larry.\r\n\r\nBlinking in the glare of the searchlights, they clamored around their\r\ncaptives, touching their pressure-suits half in awe and chattering\r\namong themselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen one of them, larger and more regally clad than the rest, stepped\r\nup and gestured toward the balcony.\r\n\r\n\"They obviously desire us to accompany them above,\" said the\r\nprofessor, \"and quite as obviously we have little choice in the\r\nmatter, so I suggest we do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Check!\" said Larry.\r\n\r\n\"And double-check!\" added Diane.\r\n\r\nSo they started up, preceded by a handful of their captors and\r\nfollowed by the main party.\r\n\r\nThe gallery seemed to be leading toward the center of the pyramid, but\r\nafter a hundred feet or so it turned and continued up at a right\r\nangle, turning twice more before they arrived at length in another\r\nstone chamber, smaller than the one below.\r\n\r\nHere their guides paused and waited for the main party.\r\n\r\nThere followed another conference, whereupon their leader stepped up\r\nagain, indicating this time that they were to remove their suits.\r\n\r\nAt this, Professor Stevens balked.\r\n\r\n\"It is suicide!\" he declared. \"The air to which they are accustomed\r\nhere is doubtless at many times our own atmospheric pressure.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't see that there's anything to do about it,\" said Larry, as\r\ntheir captors danced about them menacingly. \"I for one will take a\r\nchance!\"\r\n\r\nAnd before they could stop him, he had pressed the release-valve,\r\nemitting the air from his suit--slowly, at first, then more and more\r\nrapidly, as no ill effects seemed to result.\r\n\r\nFinally, flinging off the now deflated suit, he stepped before them in\r\nhis ordinary clothes, calling with a smile:\r\n\r\n\"Come on out, folks--the air's fine!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis statement was somewhat of an exaggeration, as the air smelt dank\r\nand bad. But at least it was breathable, as Diane and her father found\r\nwhen they emerged from their own suits.\r\n\r\nThey discovered, furthermore, now that their flashlights were no\r\nlonger operating, that a faint illumination lit the room, issuing from\r\na number of small crystal jars suspended from the walls: some sort of\r\nphosphorescence, evidently.\r\n\r\nOnce again the leader of the curious throng stepped up to them,\r\nbeaming now and addressing Professor Stevens in some barbaric tongue,\r\nand, to their amazement, he replied in words approximating its harsh\r\nsyllables.\r\n\r\n\"Why, daddy!\" gasped Diane. \"How can you talk to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply enough,\" was the reply. \"They speak a language which seems to\r\nbe about one-third Basque, mixed oddly with Greek. It merely proves\r\nanother hypothesis of mine, namely, that the Atlantean influence\r\nreached eastward to the Pyrenees mountains and the Hellenic peninsula,\r\nas well as to Egypt.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhereupon he turned and continued his conversation, haltingly it is\r\ntrue and with many gestures, but understandably nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\"I have received considerable enlightenment as to the mystery of this\r\nstrange sunken empire,\" he reported, turning back to them at length.\r\n\"It is a singular story this creature tells, of how his country sank\r\nslowly beneath the waves, during the course of centuries, and of how\r\nhis ancestors adapted themselves by degrees to the present conditions.\r\nI shall report it to you both, in detail, when time affords. But the\r\nmain thing now is that a man similar to ourselves has conquered their\r\ncountry and set himself up as emperor. It is to him we are about to be\r\ntaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it doesn't seem possible!\" exclaimed Diane. \"Why, how could he\r\nhave got down here?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a craft similar to our own, according to this creature. Heaven\r\nknows what it is we are about to face! But whatever it is, we will\r\nface it bravely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Check and double-check!\" said Larry, with a glance toward Diane that\r\ntold her she would not find him wanting.\r\n\r\nThey were not destined to meet the test just then, however, for just\r\nat that moment a courier in breech-clout and sandals dashed up the\r\ngallery and burst into the room, bearing in his right hand a thin\r\nsquare of metal.\r\n\r\nBowing, he handed it to the leader of the pigmy throng, with the awed\r\nword:\r\n\r\n\"_Cabiri!_\"\r\n\r\nAt this, Professor Stevens gave a start.\r\n\r\n\"A message from their high priests!\" he whispered.\r\n\r\nWhatever it contained, the effect produced on the reader was profound.\r\nFacing his companions, he addressed them gravely. Then, turning from\r\nthe room, he commanded the captives to follow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe way led back down the inclined gallery to a point where another\r\ndoor now stood open, then on down until finally the passage leveled\r\nout into a long, straight tunnel.\r\n\r\nThis they traversed for fully a mile, entering at length a large,\r\nsquare chamber where for a moment they paused.\r\n\r\n\"I judge we are now at the base of the large pyramid,\" the professor\r\nvoiced in an undertone. \"It would naturally be the abode of the high\r\npriests.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you suppose they want with us?\" asked Diane.\r\n\r\n\"That I am not disposed to conjecture,\" was her father's reply.\r\n\r\nBut the note of anxiety in his voice was not lost on Diane, nor on\r\nLarry, who pressed her hand reassuringly.\r\n\r\nNow their captors led them from the room through a small door opening\r\non another inclined gallery, whose turns they followed until all were\r\nout of breath from the climb.\r\n\r\nIt ended abruptly on a short, level corridor with apertures to left\r\nand right.\r\n\r\nInto the latter they were led, finding themselves in a grotesquely\r\nfurnished room, lit dimly by phosphorescent lamps.\r\n\r\nSwiftly the leader addressed Professor Stevens. Then all withdrew. The\r\naperture was closed by a sliding block of stone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a moment they stood there silent, straining their eyes in the\r\ngloom to detect the details of their surroundings, which included\r\nseveral curious chairs and a number of mattings strewn on the tiled\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\"What did he say?\" asked Diane at length, in a tremulous voice.\r\n\r\n\"He said we will remain here for the night,\" her father replied, \"and\r\nwill be taken before the high priests at dawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"At dawn!\" exclaimed Larry. \"How the deuce do they know when it is\r\ndawn, down here?\"\r\n\r\n\"By their calendars, which they have kept accurately,\" was the answer.\r\n\"But there are many other questions you must both want to ask, so I\r\nshall anticipate them by telling you now what I have been able to\r\nlearn. Suppose we first sit down, however. I for one am weary.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon they drew up three of those curious chairs of some heavy\r\nwood carved with the hideous figures of this strange people's ancient\r\ngods, and Professor Stevens began.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTheir sunken empire, as he had surmised, had indeed been the great\r\nisland of Antillia and a colony of Atlantis. A series of earthquakes\r\nand tidal waves such as engulfed their homeland ages before had sent\r\nit down, and the estimated archaeological date of the final\r\nsubmergence--namely, 200 B. C.--was approximately correct.\r\n\r\nBut long before this ultimate catastrophe, the bulk of the\r\ndisheartened population had migrated to Central and South America,\r\nfounding the Mayan and Incan dynasties. Many of the faithful had\r\nstayed on, however, among them most of the Cabiri or high priests, who\r\neither were loath to leave their temples or had been ordered by their\r\ngods to remain.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, they had remained, and as the great island sank lower and\r\nlower, they had fortified themselves against the disaster in their\r\npyramids, which by then alone remained above the surface.\r\n\r\nThese, too, had gradually disappeared beneath the angry waters,\r\nhowever, and with them had disappeared the steadfast priests and their\r\nfaithful followers, sealing their living tombs into air-tight\r\nbell-jars that retained the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis they had supplemented at first by drawing it down from above, but\r\nas time went by they found other means of getting air; extracting it\r\nfrom the sea water under pressure, by utilizing their subterranean\r\nvolcanoes, in whose seething cauldrons the gods had placed their\r\nsalvation; and it was this process that now provided them with the\r\natmosphere which had so amazed their captives.\r\n\r\nBut naturally, lack of sunshine had produced serious degeneration in\r\ntheir race, and that accounted for their diminutive forms and pale\r\nbodies. Still, they had been able to survive with a degree of\r\nhappiness until some ten or a dozen years ago, when a strange enemy\r\nhad come down in a great metal fish, like that of these new strangers,\r\nand with a handful of men had conquered their country.\r\n\r\nThis marauder was after their gold and had looted their temples\r\nruthlessly, carrying away its treasures, for which they hated him with\r\na fury that only violation of their most sacred deities could arouse.\r\nLong ago they would have destroyed him, but for the fact that he\r\npossessed terrible weapons which were impossible to combat. But they\r\nwere in smouldering rebellion and waited only the support of their\r\ngods, when they would fall on this oppressor and hurl him off.\r\n\r\nThat, though it left many things unexplained, was all the professor\r\nhad been able to gather from his conversation with the leader of their\r\ncaptors. He ended, admitting regretfully that he was still in\r\nignorance of what fate had befallen Captain Petersen and the crew of\r\nthe _Nereid._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps this fellow in the other submarine has got them,\" suggested\r\nLarry.\r\n\r\n\"But why weren't we taken to him too?\" asked Diane. \"What do you\r\nsuppose they want with us, anyway, daddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, my dear, as I told you before,\" replied her father, \"I am not\r\ndisposed to conjecture. Time will reveal it. Meanwhile, we can only\r\nwait.\"\r\n\r\nAs before, there was a note of anxiety in his voice not lost on either\r\nof them. And as for Larry, though he knew but little of those old\r\nreligions, he knew enough to realize that their altars often ran with\r\nthe blood of their captives, and he shuddered.\r\n\r\nWith these grim thoughts between them, the trio fell silent.\r\n\r\nA silence that was interrupted presently by the arrival of a native\r\nbearing a tray heaped with strange food.\r\n\r\nBowing, he placed it before them and departed.\r\n\r\nUpon examination, the meal proved to consist mainly of some curious\r\nkind of steamed fish, not unpalatable but rather rank and tough. There\r\nwere several varieties of fungus, too, more or less resembling\r\nmushrooms and doubtless grown in some sunless garden of the pyramid.\r\n\r\nThese articles, together with a pitcher of good water that had\r\nobviously been distilled from the sea, comprised their meal, and\r\nthough it was far from appetizing, they ate it.\r\n\r\nBut none of the three slept that night, though Diane dozed off for a\r\nfew minutes once or twice, for their apprehension of what the dawn\r\nmight hold made it impossible, to say nothing of the closeness of the\r\nair in that windowless subterranean room.\r\n\r\nSlowly, wearily, the hours dragged by.\r\n\r\nAt length the native who had brought their food came again. This time\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\n\"He says we are now to be taken before the high priests,\" Professor\r\nStevens translated for them.\r\n\r\nAlmost with relief, though their faces were grave, they stepped out\r\ninto the corridor, where an escort waited.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, after proceeding along an inclined gallery that\r\nwound ever upward, they were ushered into a vast vaulted chamber lit\r\nwith a thousand phosphorescent lamps and gleaming with idols of gold\r\nand silver, jewels flashing from their eyes.\r\n\r\nHigh in the dome hung a great golden disc, representing the sun. At\r\nthe far end, above a marble altar, coiled a dragon with tusks of ivory\r\nand scales of jade, its eyes two lustrous pearls.\r\n\r\nAnd all about the room thronged priests in fantastic head-dress and\r\nlong white robes, woven through elaborately with threads of yellow and\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\nAt the appearance of the captives, a murmur like a chant rose in the\r\nstill air. Someone touched a brand to the altar and there was a flash\r\nof flame followed by a thin column of smoke that spiraled slowly\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nNow one of the priests stepped out--the supreme one among them, to\r\njudge from the magnificence of his robe--and addressed the trio,\r\nspeaking slowly, rhythmically.\r\n\r\nAs his strange, sonorous discourse continued, Professor Stevens grew\r\nvisibly perturbed. His beard twitched and he shifted uneasily on his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFinally the discourse ceased and the professor replied to it, briefly.\r\nThen he turned grave eyes on Larry and Diane.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked the latter, nervously. \"What did the priest say,\r\ndaddy?\"\r\n\r\nHer father considered, before replying.\r\n\r\n\"Naturally, I did not gather everything,\" was his slow reply, \"but I\r\ngathered sufficient to understand what is afoot. First, however, let\r\nme explain that the dragon you see over there represents their deity\r\nTlaloc, god of the sea. In more happy circumstances, it would be\r\ninteresting to note that the name is identified with the Mayan god of\r\nthe same element.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, as though loath to go on, then continued:\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, the Antillians have worshipped Tlaloc principally, since\r\ntheir sun god failed them. They believe he dragged down their empire\r\nin his mighty coils, through anger with them, and will raise it up\r\nagain if appeased. Therefore they propose today to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Daddy!\" cried Diane, shrinking back in horror, while a chill went up\r\nLarry's spine. \"You mean--mean that--\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, my poor child, that we are about to be sacrificed to the\r\ndragon god of the Antillians.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe words were no more than uttered, when with a weird chant the\r\nCabiri closed in on their victims and led them with solemn ceremonial\r\ntoward the altar.\r\n\r\nIn vain did Professor Stevens protest. Their decision had been made\r\nand was irrevocable. Tlaloc must be appeased. Lo, even now he roared\r\nfor the offering!\r\n\r\nThey pointed to the dragon, from whose nostrils suddenly issued\r\nhissing spurts of flame.\r\n\r\nLarry fumed in disgust at the cheap hocus-pocus of it--but the next\r\nmoment a more violent emotion swept over him as he saw Diane seized\r\nand borne swiftly to that loathsome shrine.\r\n\r\nBut even as he lunged forward, the professor reached his daughter's\r\nside. Throwing himself in front of her, he begged them to spare her,\r\nto sacrifice him instead.\r\n\r\nThe answer of the priests was a blow that knocked the graybeard\r\nsenseless, and lifting Diane up, half-swooning, they flung her upon\r\nthe altar.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hunter! Larry!\" came her despairing cry.\r\n\r\nShe struggled up and for a moment her blue eyes opened, met his\r\nbeseechingly.\r\n\r\nThat was enough--that and that despairing cry, \"Larry!\"\r\n\r\nWith the strength of frenzy, he flung off his captors, rushed to her\r\naid, his hard fists flailing.\r\n\r\nThe pigmies went down in his path like grain before the scythe.\r\nReaching the altar, he seized the priest whose knife was already\r\nupraised, and, lifting him bodily, flung him full into the ugly snout\r\nof that snorting dragon.\r\n\r\nThen, as a wail of dismay rose from the Cabiri, at this supreme\r\nsacrilege, he seized the now unconscious Diane and retreated with her\r\ntoward the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut there spears barred his escape; and now, recovered from the first\r\nshock of this fearful affront to their god, the priests started toward\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nStanding at bay, with that limp, tender burden in his arms, Larry\r\nawaited the end.\r\n\r\nAs the maddened horde drew near, she stirred, lifted her pale face and\r\nsmiled, her eyes still shut.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Larry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Diane!\"\r\n\r\n\"You saved me. I won't forget.\"\r\n\r\nThen, the smile still lingering, she slipped once more into merciful\r\noblivion, and as Larry held her close to his heart, a new warmth\r\nkindled there.\r\n\r\nBut bitterness burned in his heart, too. He had saved her--won her\r\nlove, perhaps--only to lose her. It wasn't fair! Was there no way out?\r\n\r\nThe priests were close now, their pasty faces leering with fierce\r\nanticipation of their revenge, when suddenly, from down the gallery\r\noutside that guarded door, came the sharp crash of an explosion,\r\nfollowed by shouts and the rush of feet.\r\n\r\nAt the sound, the priests trembled, fled backward into the room and\r\nfell moaning before their idols, while the quaking guards strove\r\nfrantically to close the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut before they could do so, in burst a half dozen brawny sailors in\r\nforeign uniform, bearing in their hands little black bulbs that looked\r\nsuspiciously like grenades. Shouting in a tongue Larry could not\r\ndistinguish above the uproar, they advanced upon the retreating guards\r\nand priests.\r\n\r\nThen, when all were herded in the far corner of the room, the sailors\r\nbacked toward the door. Motioning for Larry and Diane to clear out,\r\nthey raised those sinister little missiles, prepared to fling them.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" cried Larry, thinking of Professor Stevens.\r\n\r\nAnd releasing Diane, who had revived, he rushed forward, seized the\r\nprostrate savant from amid the unresisting Cabiri, and bore him to\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n\"Daddy!\" sobbed Diane, swaying to meet them.\r\n\r\n\"Back!\" shouted one of the sailors, shoving them through the door.\r\n\r\nThe last glimpse Larry had of that fateful room was the horde of\r\npriests and guards huddled before their altar, voices lifted in\r\nsupplication to that hideous dragon god.\r\n\r\nThen issued a series of blinding flashes followed by deafening\r\nexplosions, mingled with shrieks of anguish.\r\n\r\nSickened, he stood there, as the reverberations died away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresently, when it was plain no further menace would come from that\r\nblasted temple, their rescuers led the trio back down those winding\r\ngalleries, and through that long, straight tunnel to the smaller\r\npyramid.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stevens had recovered consciousness by now and was able to\r\nwalk, with Larry's aid, though a matted clot of blood above his left\r\near showed the force of the blow he had received.\r\n\r\nThe way, after reaching the smaller pyramid, led up those other\r\ngalleries they had mounted the night before.\r\n\r\nThis time, undoubtedly, they were to be taken before that mysterious\r\nusurping emperor. And what would be the result of that audience? Would\r\nit but plunge them from the frying pan into the fire, wondered Larry,\r\nor would it mean their salvation?\r\n\r\nAnyway, he concluded, no fate could be worse than the hideous one they\r\nhad just escaped. But if only Diane could be spared further anguish!\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her fondly, as they walked along, and she returned him a\r\nwarm smile.\r\n\r\nNow the way led into a short, level passage ending in a door guarded\r\nby two sailors with rifles. They presented arms, as their comrades\r\ncame up, and flung open the door.\r\n\r\nAs he stepped inside, Larry blinked in amazement, for he was greeted\r\nby electric lights in ornate clusters, richly carpeted floors, walls\r\nhung with modern paintings--and there at the far end, beside a massive\r\ndesk, stood an imposing personage in foreign naval uniform of high\r\nrank, strangely familiar, strangely reminiscent of war days.\r\n\r\nEven before the man spoke, in his guttural English, the suspicion\r\nthose sailors had aroused crystallized itself.\r\n\r\nA German! A U-boat commander!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Greetings, gentlemen--and the little lady,\" boomed their host, with\r\nheavy affability. \"I see that my men were in time. These swine of\r\nAntillians are a tricky lot. I must apologize for them--my subjects.\"\r\n\r\nThe last word was pronounced with scathing contempt.\r\n\r\n\"We return greetings!\" said Professor Stevens. \"To whom, might I ask,\r\ndo we owe our lives, and the honor of this interview?\"\r\n\r\nLarry smiled. The old graybeard was up to his form, all right!\r\n\r\n\"You are addressing Herr Rolf von Ullrich,\" the flattered German\r\nreplied, adding genially: \"commander of one of His Imperial Majesty's\r\nsuper-submarines during the late war and at present Emperor of\r\nAntillia.\"\r\n\r\nTo which the professor replied with dignity that he was greatly\r\nhonored to make the acquaintance of so exalted a personage, and\r\nproceeded in turn to introduce himself and party. But Von Ullrich\r\nchecked him with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"The distinguished Professor Stevens and his charming daughter need no\r\nintroduction, as they are already familiar to me through the American\r\npress and radio,\" he said. \"While as for Mr. Hunter, your Captain\r\nPetersen has already made me acquainted with his name.\"\r\n\r\nAt the mention of the commander of the _Nereid_, all three of them\r\ngave a start.\r\n\r\n\"Then--then my captain and crew are safe?\" asked the professor,\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Quite,\" Von Ullrich assured him. \"You will be taken to them\r\npresently. But first there are one or two little things you would like\r\nexplained--yes? Then I shall put to you a proposal, which if\r\nacceptable will guarantee your safe departure from my adopted\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the German traced briefly the events leading up to the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the last months of the war, he had been placed in command of a\r\nspecial U-boat known as the \"mystery ship\"--designed to resist\r\ndepth-charges and embodying many other innovations, most of them\r\ngrowing out of his own experience with earlier submarines.\r\n\r\nOne day, while cruising off the West Indies, in wait for some luckless\r\nsugar boat, he had been surprised by a destroyer and forced to\r\nsubmerge so suddenly that his diving gear had jammed and they had gone\r\nto the bottom. But the craft had managed to withstand the pressure and\r\nthey had been able to repair the damage, limping home with a bad leak\r\nbut otherwise none the worse for the experience.\r\n\r\nThe leak repaired and the hull further strengthened, he had set out\r\nagain. But when in mid-Atlantic the Armistice had come, and rather\r\nthan return to a defeated country, subject possibly to Allied revenge,\r\nhe had persuaded his crew to remain out and let their craft be\r\nreported missing.\r\n\r\nWhat followed then, though Von Ullrich masked it in polite words, was\r\na story of piracy, until they found by degrees that there was more\r\ngold on the bottom of the ocean than the top; and from this to the\r\ndiscovery of the sunken empire where he now held reign was but a step.\r\n\r\nThey had thought at first they were looting only empty temples--but,\r\nfinding people there, had easily conquered them, though ruling them,\r\nhe admitted, was another matter. As, for instance, yesterday, when the\r\npriests had interfered with his orders and carried his three chief\r\ncaptives off to sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\"Where now, but for me, you would be food for their gods!\" he ended.\r\n\"And if you do not find my hospitality altogether to your liking,\r\nfriends, remember that you came uninvited. In fact, if you will\r\nrecall, you came despite my explicit warning!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut since they were here, he told them, they might be willing to repay\r\nhis good turn with another.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Von Ullrich launched into his proposal, which was that\r\nProfessor Stevens place the _Nereid_ at his disposal for visiting the\r\ndepths at the foot of the plateau, where lay the capital of the\r\nempire, he said--a magnificent metropolis known as the City of the Sun\r\nand modeled after the great Atlantean capital, the City of the Golden\r\nGates, and the depository of a treasure, the greedy German believed,\r\nthat was the ransom of the world.\r\n\r\nThe professor frowned, and for a moment Larry thought he was going to\r\nremind their host that this was not a treasure hunt.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" he asked instead, \"do you not use your own submarine for the\r\npurpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because for one thing, she will not stand the pressure, nor will our\r\nsuits,\" was the reply. \"And for another, she is already laden with\r\ntreasure, ready for an--er--forced abdication!\" with a sardonic laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Then have you not enough gold already?\"\r\n\r\n\"For myself, yes. But there are my men, you see--and men who have\r\nglimpsed the treasures of the earth are not easily satisfied,\r\nProfessor. But have no fear. You shall accompany us, and, by your aid,\r\nshall pay your own ransom.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVon Ullrich made no mention of the alternative, in case the aid was\r\nrefused, but the ominous light Larry caught in his cold gray eyes\r\nspoke as clearly as words.\r\n\r\nSo, since there was nothing else to do, Professor Stevens agreed.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the audience terminated and they were led from the presence\r\nof this arrogant German to another apartment, where they were to meet\r\nCaptain Petersen and the crew of the _Nereid._\r\n\r\nAs they proceeded toward it, under guard, Larry wondered why Von\r\nUllrich had even troubled to make the request, when he held it in his\r\npower to take the craft anyway.\r\n\r\nBut after the first joyful moment of reunion, it was a mystery no\r\nlonger, for Captain Petersen reported that immediately upon their\r\ncapture, the commander of the U-boat had tried to force him to reveal\r\nthe operation of the _Nereid_, but that he had steadfastly refused,\r\neven though threatened with torture.\r\n\r\nAnd to think, it came to Larry with a new twinge of shame, that he had\r\nsuspected this gallant man of mutiny!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat very morning, while Professor Stevens and his party were still\r\nexchanging experiences with Captain Petersen and the members of the\r\ncrew, Von Ullrich sent for them and they gathered with his own men in\r\nthe small lock-chamber at the base of the pyramid.\r\n\r\nThere they were provided with temporary suits by their host, since\r\ntheir own--which they brought along--could be inflated only from the\r\n_Nereid_.\r\n\r\nBeside her, they noted as they emerged in relays, the U-boat was now\r\nmoored.\r\n\r\nEntering their own craft, they got under way at once and headed\r\nswiftly westward toward the brink of the plateau. Most of Von\r\nUllrich's crew were with them, though a few had been left behind to\r\nguard against any treachery, on the part of the now sullen and aroused\r\npopulace.\r\n\r\nSlipping out over the edge of that precipitous tableland, they tilted\r\nher rudders and dove to the abysm below.\r\n\r\nPresently the central square of the illuminated panel in the\r\nnavigating room showed three great concentric circles, enclosed by a\r\nquadrangle that must have been miles on a side--and within this vast\r\nsunken fortress lay a city of innumerable pyramids and temples and\r\npalaces.\r\n\r\nThe German's eyes flashed greedily as he peered upon this vision.\r\n\r\n\"There you are!\" he exclaimed, quivering with excitement. \"Those\r\ncircles, that square: what would you judge they were, Professor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would judge that originally they were the canals bearing the\r\nmunicipal water supply,\" Martin Stevens told him quietly, suppressing\r\nhis own excitement, \"for such was said to be the construction of the\r\nCity of the Golden Gates; but now I judge they are walls raised on\r\nthose original foundations by the frantic populace, when the\r\nsubmergence first began, in a vain effort to hold back the tides that\r\nengulfed them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you think they are of gold?\"\r\n\r\n\"Frankly, no; though I have no doubt you will find plenty of that\r\nelement down there.\"\r\n\r\nNor was the prediction wrong, for modern eyes had never seen such a\r\ntreasure house as they beheld when presently the _Nereid_ came to rest\r\noutside that ancient four-walled city and they forced their way\r\ninside.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough the walls were not of gold, the inner gates were, and the\r\ntemples were fairly bursting with the precious metal, as well as rare\r\njewels, the eyes of a thousand idols gleaming with rubies and\r\nemeralds.\r\n\r\nBut where was the populace, amid all this prodigious wealth? Was there\r\nno life down here?\r\n\r\nVon Ullrich declared through the vibrator of his pressure-suit that he\r\nhad heard there was. And as though in substantiation, many of the\r\ntemples showed the same bell-jar construction as the pyramids above,\r\nthough even stouter, revealing evidences of having been occupied very\r\nrecently; but all were flooded and empty. The city was as a city of\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\nThis ominous sign did not deter the \"emperor,\" however. Ruthlessly he\r\nand his men looted those flooded temples, forcing Professor Stevens\r\nand his party to lend aid in the orgy of pillage.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time, Larry had an uneasy feeling of gathering furtive\r\nhosts about them, waiting--waiting for what?\r\n\r\nHe confided his fears to no one, though he noted with relief that Von\r\nUllrich seemed to sense these unseen presences too, for he proceeded\r\nwith caution and always kept a strong guard outside.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy early afternoon, the _Nereid_ was one great coffer-chest.\r\n\r\nBut still the rapacious U-boat commander was unsatisfied, though\r\nProfessor Stevens began to have doubts if his craft could lift that\r\nmassive weight of plunder to the top of the plateau.\r\n\r\n\"One more load and we go,\" he soothed. \"A few more pretties for the\r\nlittle lady!\"\r\n\r\nLarry writhed, and should have suspected then and there--but as it\r\nwas, the blow fell unexpected, stunning.\r\n\r\nFiling from the lock, they failed to notice that Von Ullrich and his\r\ncrew hung back, until there came a sudden, guttural command, whereupon\r\nDiane was seized and the massive door flung shut in their faces.\r\n\r\nAppalled by this overwhelming disaster, the party stood for a moment\r\nmotionless, speechless. Then, as one, Larry and the professor rushed\r\nforward and beat upon that barred hatch, calling upon Von Ullrich to\r\nopen it.\r\n\r\nFrom within the submarine, through their vibrators, they heard him\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"_Auf Wiedersehen!_\" he toasted them. \"I now have all the treasure I\r\nwant! The rest I leave to you! Help yourselves!\"\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke, the _Nereid's_ auxiliary propellers started churning\r\nthe water. Slowly, sluggishly, like some great gorged fish, the sturdy\r\ncraft moved off, lifted her snout, headed upward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Stevens bowed his head, and Larry could well picture the\r\ngrief that distorted the graybeard's face, inside that owl-eyed\r\nhelmet.\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up!\" he said, though his own face was twisted with anguish.\r\n\"Perhaps--\"\r\n\r\nThen he paused--for how could he say that perhaps the situation wasn't\r\nas bad as it seemed, when it was obviously hopeless?\r\n\r\n\"My poor Diane!\" moaned the professor. \"Poor child. Poor child!\"\r\n\r\nAs for Captain Petersen and the crew, they said nothing. Perhaps they\r\nwere thinking of Diane, perhaps of themselves. At least, they knew it\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nOr so they thought. But to Larry, suddenly, occurred a gleam of hope.\r\nThat strange sense of unseen presences! It was bizarre, of course, but\r\ndoesn't a drowning person catch at straws? And Lord knows they were\r\ndrowning, if ever anyone was!\r\n\r\nHe turned and confided to Professor Stevens his idea, which was to\r\nretrace their steps within the city gates, seek out the populace and\r\nthrow themselves on their mercy.\r\n\r\nThe stricken savant, too, grasped at the straw.\r\n\r\n\"It seems fantastic, but after all it is a chance,\" he admitted.\r\n\r\nSo they pushed back into that great submerged city, with Captain\r\nPetersen and his skeptical crew. They entered one of the largest of\r\nthe temples, wandered forlornly through its flooded halls and\r\ncorridors, seeking some sign of these alleged beings Larry had sensed.\r\n\r\nNor was their search unrewarded, for suddenly the captain himself,\r\nmost skeptical of all, cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Listen! Did you hear that?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no need to ask the question, for all had heard. It was a\r\nrasping sound, as of some great door swinging shut, followed almost\r\nimmediately by a rushing gurgle--and as they stood there tense, the\r\nwater level began rapidly receding.\r\n\r\nEven while it was still plashing about their ankles, a secret block of\r\nmasonry slid back and a horde of Antillians burst in upon them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat happened then, happened with a rush that left them dazed.\r\n\r\nUnable to talk directly with the pigmies, by reason of their\r\npressure-suits, which they dared not remove, they started gesturing\r\nwith them, trying to explain their predicament and make known that\r\nthey bore them no ill-will, but the creatures waved for them to cease\r\nand led them swiftly through the now waterless temple.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess it's all up!\" said Larry, adding with dismal humor:\r\n\"They're probably going to finish that meal they started feeding their\r\ndragon last night!\"\r\n\r\nNo one laughed, nor made any comment, and he relapsed into silence,\r\nrealizing that they probably held him responsible for this latest\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nLeaving the temple, their captors led them into a passage that was\r\nlevel for a time, then inclined sharply. It was laborious going but\r\nthey struggled on.\r\n\r\n\"I believe they know we are not their enemies!\" declared Professor\r\nStevens, at length, to everyone's cheer. \"They seem to be leading us\r\nback to the plateau by some underground passage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's hope so!\" said Larry. \"Perhaps I had the right hunch after\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my poor Diane!\" came the professor's sorrowing after-thought.\r\n\"That fiend Von Ullrich could never get the _Nereid_ up safely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think perhaps he could, with Miss Stevens to help him,\" put in\r\nCaptain Petersen, his usual optimism returning. \"She is thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the craft's operation.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so,\" her father admitted, his tone brighter. \"But--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's so!\" exclaimed Larry, breaking off any less hopeful\r\nreflections. \"So cheerio, folks, as the English say. We'll make it\r\nyet!\"\r\n\r\nBut in his heart, he was tormented with doubt for Diane's safety....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe trail was growing eery, now, and precipitous. To their right rose\r\na sheer cliff. To their left, the path fell off abruptly to a gigantic\r\ncaldron where red flames leaped and waned.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like something out of Dante's 'Inferno'!\" muttered Larry, with\r\na shudder.\r\n\r\n\"The volcano where they distill their atmosphere, evidently,\"\r\ncommented Professor Stevens. \"It would have been interesting, in other\r\ncircumstances, to observe the process.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to me, it wouldn't!\"\r\n\r\nLarry was glad when they had passed that seething hell-pot and were\r\nonce more proceeding through a long, dark gallery.\r\n\r\nBut everywhere, though their guides were but a handful, was a sense of\r\nthose unseen presences, of gathering, furtive hosts about them,\r\nwaiting--waiting for what?\r\n\r\nWhat was this strange sense of tension, of foreboding, that hung in\r\nthe air? Was the professor wrong? Were they being led to their doom,\r\nafter all?\r\n\r\nHe was soon to know, for now the gallery they had been traversing\r\nlevelled out into a series of short passages, each barred by a heavy\r\nstone door, and finally they were led into a small, square room,\r\nbarely large enough to admit them all.\r\n\r\nThere, with gestures toward the far end, their guides left them.\r\n\r\nThe door closed, and almost immediately another on the opposite side\r\nopened, slowly at first, then wider and wider, admitting a rush of\r\nwater that promptly filled the room.\r\n\r\nStepping wonderingly out, they found themselves on the upper level,\r\nbeside the second of the two smaller pyramids.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" gasped Larry, as they stood looking around, still a little\r\ndazed. \"These people are sure quick-change artists! First they try to\r\nfeed you to their gods, then they save you from almost as bad a fate.\r\nDizzy, I call it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite understandable, I should say,\" declared the professor. \"Unable\r\nto cope with Von Ullrich themselves, they think perhaps we may be able\r\nto.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let's hope they're right!\" grimly. \"If once I get my hands on\r\nhim--\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off suddenly, as Captain Petersen called out:\r\n\r\n\"The _Nereid_! There she is!\"\r\n\r\nFollowing with their eyes the bright segment cut into the murky depths\r\nby his flashlight, they saw the familiar outlines of their craft; and\r\nclose beside her lay the U-boat.\r\n\r\nA feverish activity seemed to be going on between the two submarines.\r\n\r\n\"They're changing cargo!\" cried Larry. \"Quick! We've got them now!\"\r\n\r\nBut the progress they were able to make, hampered by their heavy\r\nsuits, was maddeningly slow. Their searchlights, moreover, betrayed\r\ntheir approach. Before they could reach the scene, most of the sailors\r\nhad abandoned their task and piled into the U-boat.\r\n\r\nArms swinging wildly, Von Ullrich stood beside it, trying to rally\r\nthen. Refusing to risk combat, however, since they were unable to use\r\ntheir deadly hand-grenades under water, they continued clambering up\r\nthe sides of their submersible and shoving down through its\r\nconning-tower hatch.\r\n\r\nNow a figure in a familiar pressure-suit broke away and started toward\r\nthe advancing party.\r\n\r\nIt was Diane!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven as he recognized her, Larry saw Von Ullrich lunge forward, seize\r\nhis captive and mount to the conning-tower with her--but before the\r\nGerman could thrust her into the hatch, he had reached the U-boat's\r\nside and clambered to her rescue.\r\n\r\nDropping Diane, Von Ullrich wheeled to face his assailant. They\r\ngrappled, fell to the deck, rolled over and over.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, as they were struggling, there came a sound that caused\r\nthe German to burst free and leap to his feet.\r\n\r\nIt was the sound of engines under them!\r\n\r\nIgnoring Larry now, Von Ullrich staggered to the conning-tower hatch.\r\nIt was battened fast. Frantically he beat on it.\r\n\r\nThis much Larry saw, as he knelt there getting his breath. Then he\r\nrose, took Diane by the arm and led her down. And he was none too\r\nsoon, for with a lunge the U-boat got under way.\r\n\r\nBut she seemed unable to lift her loot-laden mass from the ocean\r\nfloor, and headed off crazily across the plateau, dragging her keel in\r\nthe sand.\r\n\r\nWith fascinated horror, they watched the craft's erratic course, as it\r\nswung loggily westward and headed toward that yawning abysm from which\r\nthey had all so lately risen.\r\n\r\nThe last sight they had of the U-boat was as it reached the brink, its\r\ndespairing commander still standing in the conning-tower, hammering\r\nvainly on that fast-bound hatch; then they turned away faint, as the\r\ndoomed craft plunged down, stern up, into those crushing depths.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Stevens now joined them.\r\n\r\n\"A lesson in avarice,\" he said gravely, when he had greeted his\r\ndaughter with heartfelt relief. \"And a typical fate of fortune\r\nhunters! Let that be a lesson to you, young man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen!\" said Larry.\r\n\r\n\"But what happened, my dear?\" asked the professor of Diane, a moment\r\nlater. \"Why were they in such a hurry to be off?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the sensible Antillians seized their opportunity and overcame\r\ntheir guards, while we were below,\" was her reply. \"When we got back,\r\nwe found the pyramids flooded, so there was nothing else for them to\r\ndo but go.\"\r\n\r\nSo that was the explanation of those gathering, furtive hosts in the\r\nlower level, thought Larry. Now he knew what they had been waiting\r\nfor! They had been waiting for that usurping vandal to depart.\r\n\r\nAnd how they must be gloating now, down there!\r\n\r\n\"But why were they so eager to abandon the _Nereid_?\" asked the\r\nsavant, still puzzled. \"It it a better boat than theirs, even if I do\r\nsay so myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I put it out of commission, directly we got back up here,\"\r\nreplied Diane. \"But not permanently!\" she added, with what Larry knew\r\nwas a smile, though he couldn't see her face, of course, through the\r\nhelmet of her pressure-suit.\r\n\r\n\"Little thoroughbred!\" he exclaimed, half to himself.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say, Mr. Hunter?--Larry, I mean,\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"N--nothing,\" he replied uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"Fibber!\" said Diane. \"I heard you the first time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just wait till I get out of this darned suit!\" said Larry.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I can wait that long!\" she told him.\r\n\r\nAnd if Professor Stevens heard any of this, it went in one ear and out\r\nthe other, for he was thinking what a report he would have to make to\r\nhis confrères when they got home--particularly with half a boatload\r\nof assorted idols for proof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He pressed the tiny switch in the flame-tool's handle\r\njust as Arlok came through the door.]\r\n\r\nThe Gate to Xoran\r\n\r\n_By Hal K. Wells_\r\n\r\n    A strange man of metal comes to Earth on a dreadful mission.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sat in a small half-darkened booth well over in the corner--the man\r\nwith the strangely glowing blue-green eyes.\r\n\r\nThe booth was one of a score that circled the walls of the \"Maori\r\nHut,\" a popular night club in the San Fernando Valley some five miles\r\nover the hills from Hollywood.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight. Half a dozen couples danced lazily in the\r\ncentral dancing space. Other couples remained tête-à-tête in the\r\nsecluded booths.\r\n\r\nIn the entire room only two men were dining alone. One was the slender\r\ngray-haired little man with the weirdly glowing eyes. The other was\r\nBlair Gordon, a highly successful young attorney of Los Angeles. Both\r\nmen had the unmistakable air of waiting for someone.\r\n\r\nBlair Gordon's college days were not so far distant that he had yet\r\nlost any of the splendid physique that had made him an All-American\r\ntackle. In any physical combat with the slight gray-haired stranger,\r\nGordon knew that he should be able to break the other in two with one\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nYet, as he studied the stranger from behind the potted palms that\r\nscreened his own booth. Gordon was amazed to find himself slowly being\r\novercome by an emotion of dread so intense that it verged upon sheer\r\nfear. There was something indescribably alien and utterly sinister in\r\nthat dimly seen figure in the corner booth.\r\n\r\nThe faint eery light that glowed in the stranger's deep-set eyes was\r\nnot the lambent flame seen in the chatoyant orbs of some\r\nnight-prowling jungle beast. Rather was it the blue-green glow of\r\nphosphorescent witch-light that flickers and dances in the night mists\r\nabove steaming tropical swamps.\r\n\r\nThe stranger's face was as classically perfect in its rugged outline\r\nas that of a Roman war-god, yet those perfect features seemed utterly\r\nlifeless. In the twenty minutes that he had been intently watching the\r\nstranger, Gordon would have sworn that the other's face had not moved\r\nby so much as the twitch of an eye-lash.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen a new couple entered the Maori Hut, and Gordon promptly forgot\r\nall thought of the puzzlingly alien figure in the corner. The new\r\narrivals were a vibrantly beautiful blond girl and a plump,\r\nsallow-faced man in the early forties. The girl was Leah Keith,\r\nHollywood's latest screen sensation. The man was Dave Redding, her\r\ndirector.\r\n\r\nA waiter seated Leah and her escort in a booth directly across the\r\nroom from that of Gordon. It was a maneuver for which Gordon had\r\ntipped lavishly when he first came to the Hut.\r\n\r\nA week ago Leah Keith's engagement to Blair Gordon had been abruptly\r\nended by a trivial little quarrel that two volatile temperaments had\r\nfanned into flames which apparently made reconciliation impossible. A\r\nmiserably lonely week had finally ended in Gordon's present trip to\r\nthe Maori Hut. He knew that Leah often came there, and he had an\r\noverwhelming longing to at least see her again, even though his pride\r\nforced him to remain unseen.\r\n\r\nNow, as he stared glumly at Leah through the palms that effectively\r\nscreened his own booth, Gordon heartily regretted that he had ever\r\ncome. The sight of Leah's clear fresh beauty merely made him realize\r\nwhat a fool he had been to let that ridiculous little quarrel come\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThen, with a sudden tingling thrill, Gordon realized that he was not\r\nthe only one in the room who was interested in Leah and her escort.\r\n\r\nOver in the half-darkened corner booth the eery stranger was staring\r\nat the girl with an intentness that made his weird eyes glow like\r\nminiature pools of shimmering blue-green fire. Again Gordon felt that\r\nvague impression of dread, as though he were in the presence of\r\nsomething utterly alien to all human experience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGordon turned his gaze back to Leah, then caught his breath sharply in\r\nsudden amaze. The necklace about Leah's throat was beginning to glow\r\nwith the same uncanny blue-green light that shone in the stranger's\r\neyes! Faint, yet unmistakable, the shimmering radiance pulsed from the\r\nnecklace in an aura of nameless evil.\r\n\r\nAnd with the coming of that aura of weird light at her throat, a\r\nstrange trance was swiftly sweeping over Leah. She sat there now as\r\nrigidly motionless as some exquisite statue of ivory and jet.\r\n\r\nGordon stared at her in stark bewilderment. He knew the history of\r\nLeah's necklace. It was merely an oddity, and nothing more--a freak\r\npiece of costume jewelry made from fragments of an Arizona meteorite.\r\nLeah had worn the necklace a dozen times before, without any trace of\r\nthe weird phenomena that were now occurring.\r\n\r\nDancers again thronged the floor to the blaring jazz of the negro\r\norchestra while Gordon was still trying to force his whirling brain to\r\na decision. He was certain that Leah was in deadly peril of some kind,\r\nyet the nature of that peril was too bizarre for his mind to imagine.\r\n\r\nThen the stranger with the glowing eyes took matters into his own\r\nhands. He left his booth and began threading his way through the\r\ndancers toward Leah. As he watched the progress of that slight\r\ngray-haired figure Gordon refused to believe the evidence of his own\r\neyes. The thing was too utterly absurd--yet Gordon was positive that\r\nthe strong oak floor of the dancing space was visibly swaying and\r\ncreaking beneath the stranger's mincing tread!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe stranger paused at Leah's booth only long enough to utter a brief\r\nlow-voiced command. Then Leah, still in the grip of that strange\r\ntrance, rose obediently from her seat to accompany him.\r\n\r\nDave Redding rose angrily to intercept her. The stranger seemed to\r\nbarely brush the irate director with his finger tips, yet Redding\r\nreeled back as though struck by a pile-driver. Leah and the stranger\r\nstarted for the door. Redding scrambled to his feet again and hurried\r\nafter them.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Gordon finally shook off the stupor of utter\r\nbewilderment that had held him. Springing from his booth, he rushed\r\nafter the trio.\r\n\r\nThe dancers in his way delayed Gordon momentarily. Leah and the\r\nstranger were already gone when he reached the door. The narrow little\r\nentrance hallway to the Hut was deserted save for a figure sprawled\r\nthere on the floor near the outer door.\r\n\r\nIt was the body of Dave Redding. Gordon shuddered as he glanced\r\nbriefly down at the huddled figure. A single mighty blow from some\r\nunknown weapon had crumpled the director's entire face in, like the\r\nshattered shell of a broken egg.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGordon charged on through the outer door just as a heavy sedan came\r\ncareening out of the parking lot. He had a flashing glimpse of Leah\r\nand the stranger in the front seat of the big car.\r\n\r\nGordon raced for his own machine, a powerful low-slung roadster. A\r\nsingle vicious jab at the starting button, and the big motor leaped\r\ninto roaring life. Gordon shot out from the parking lot onto the main\r\nboulevard. A hundred yards away the sedan was fleeing toward\r\nHollywood.\r\n\r\nGordon tramped hard on the accelerator. His engine snarled with the\r\nunleashed fury of a hundred horsepower. The gap between the two cars\r\nswiftly lessened.\r\n\r\nThen the stranger seemed to become aware for the first time that he\r\nwas being followed. The next second the big sedan accelerated with the\r\nhurtling speed of a flying bullet. Gordon sent his own foot nearly to\r\nthe floor. The roadster jumped to eighty miles an hour, yet the sedan\r\ncontinued to leave it remorselessly behind.\r\n\r\nThe two cars started up the northern slope of Cahuenga Pass with the\r\nsedan nearly two hundred yards ahead, and gaining all the time. Gordon\r\nwondered briefly if they were to flash down the other side of the Pass\r\nand on into Hollywood at their present mad speed.\r\n\r\nThen at the summit of the Pass the sedan swerved abruptly to the right\r\nand fled west along the Mulholland Highway. Gordon's tires screamed as\r\nhe swerved the roadster in hot pursuit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe dark winding mountain highway was nearly deserted at that hour of\r\nthe night. Save for an occasional automobile that swerved frantically\r\nto the side of the road to dodge the roaring onslaught of the racing\r\ncars, Gordon and the stranger had the road to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe stranger seemed no longer to be trying to leave his pursuer\r\nhopelessly behind. He allowed Gordon to come within a hundred yards of\r\nhim. But that was as near as Gordon could get, is spite of the\r\nroadster's best efforts.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen times Gordon trod savagely upon his accelerator in a\r\ndesperate attempt to close the gap, but each time the sedan fled with\r\nthe swift grace of a scudding phantom. Finally Gordon had to content\r\nhimself with merely keeping his distance behind the glowing red\r\ntail-light of the car ahead.\r\n\r\nThey passed Laurel Canyon, and still the big sedan bored on to the\r\nwest. Then finally, half a dozen miles beyond Laurel Canyon, the\r\nstranger abruptly left the main highway and started up a narrow\r\nprivate road to the crest of one of the lonely hills. Gordon slowly\r\ngained in the next two miles. When the road ended in a winding\r\ngravelled driveway into the grounds of what was apparently a private\r\nestate, the roadster was scarcely a dozen yards behind.\r\n\r\nThe stranger's features as he stood there stiffly erect in the vivid\r\nglare of the roadster's headlights were still as devoid of all\r\nexpression as ever. The only things that really seemed alive in that\r\nmasque of a face were the two eyes, glowing eery blue-green fire like\r\ntwin entities of alien evil.\r\n\r\nGordon wasted no time in verbal sparring. He motioned briefly to Leah\r\nKeith's rigid form in the front seat of the sedan.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Keith is returning to Hollywood with me,\" he said curtly. \"Will\r\nyou let her go peaceably, or shall I--?\" He left the question\r\nunfinished, but its threat was obvious.\r\n\r\n\"Or shall you do what?\" asked the stranger quietly. There was an oddly\r\nmetallic ring in his low even tones. His words were so precisely\r\nclipped that they suggested some origin more mechanical than human.\r\n\r\n\"Or shall I take Miss Keith with me by force?\" Gordon flared angrily.\r\n\r\n\"You can try to take the lady by force--if you wish.\" There was an\r\nunmistakable jeering note in the metallic tones.\r\n\r\nThe taunt was the last thing needed to unleash Gordon's volatile\r\ntemper. He stepped forward and swung a hard left hook for that\r\nexpressionless masque of a face. But the blow never landed. The\r\nstranger dodged with uncanny swiftness. His answering gesture seemed\r\nmerely the gentlest possible push with an outstretched hand, yet\r\nGordon was sent reeling backward a full dozen steps by the terrific\r\nforce of that apparently gentle blow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRecovering himself, Gordon grimly returned to the attack. The stranger\r\nagain flung out one hand in the contemptuous gesture with which one\r\nwould brush away a troublesome fly, but this time Gordon was more\r\ncautious. He neatly dodged the stranger's blow, then swung a vicious\r\nright squarely for his adversary's unprotected jaw.\r\n\r\nThe blow smashed solidly home with all of Gordon's weight behind it.\r\nThe stranger's jaw buckled and gave beneath that shattering impact.\r\nThen abruptly his entire face crumpled into distorted ruin. Gordon\r\nstaggered back a step in sheer horror at the gruesome result of his\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nThe stranger flung a hand up to his shattered features. When his hand\r\ncame away again, his whole face came away with it!\r\n\r\nGordon had one horror-stricken glimpse of a featureless blob of\r\nrubbery bluish-gray flesh in which fiendish eyes of blue-green fire\r\nblazed in malignant fury.\r\n\r\nThen the stranger fumbled at his collar, ripping the linen swiftly\r\naway. Something lashed out from beneath his throat--a loathsome\r\nsnake-like object, slender and forked at the end. For one ghastly\r\nmoment, as the writhing tentacle swung into line with him, Gordon saw\r\nits forked ends glow strange fire--one a vivid blue, the other a\r\nsparkling green.\r\n\r\nThen the world was abruptly blotted out for Blair Gordon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConsciousness returned to Gordon as swiftly and painlessly as it had\r\nleft him. For a moment he blinked stupidly in a dazed effort to\r\ncomprehend the incredible scene before him.\r\n\r\nHe was seated in a chair over near the wall of a large room that was\r\nflooded with livid red light from a single globe overhead. Beside him\r\nsat Leah Keith, also staring with dazed eyes in an effort to\r\ncomprehend her surroundings. Directly in front of them stood a figure\r\nof stark nightmare horror.\r\n\r\nThe weirdly glowing eyes identified the figure as that of the stranger\r\nat the Maori Hut, but there every point of resemblance ceased. Only\r\nthe cleverest of facial masques and body padding could ever have\r\nenabled this monstrosity to pass unnoticed in a world of normal human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nNow that his disguise was completely stripped away, his slight frame\r\nwas revealed as a grotesque parody of that of a human being, with arms\r\nand legs like pipe-stems, a bald oval head that merged with neckless\r\nrigidity directly into a heavy-shouldered body that tapered into an\r\nalmost wasp-like slenderness at the waist. He was naked save for a\r\nloin cloth of some metallic fabric. His bluish-gray skin had a dull\r\noily sheen strangely suggestive of fine grained flexible metal.\r\n\r\nThe creature's face was hideously unlike anything human. Beneath the\r\nglowing eyes was a small circular mouth orifice with a cluster of\r\ngill-like appendages on either side of it. Patches of lighter-colored\r\nskin on either side of the head seemed to serve as ears. From a point\r\njust under the head, where the throat of a human being would have\r\nbeen, dangled the foot-and-a-half long tentacle whose forked tip had\r\nsent Gordon into oblivion.\r\n\r\nBehind the creature Gordon was dimly aware of a maze of complicated\r\nand utterly unfamiliar apparatus ranged along the opposite wall,\r\ngiving the room the appearance of being a laboratory of some kind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGordon's obvious bewilderment seemed to amuse the bluish-gray\r\nmonstrosity. \"May I introduce myself?\" he asked with a mocking note in\r\nhis metallic voice. \"I am Arlok of Xoran. I am an explorer of Space,\r\nand more particularly an Opener of Gates. My home is upon Xoran, which\r\nis one of the eleven major planets that circle about the giant\r\nblue-white sun that your astronomers call Rigel. I am here to open the\r\nGate between your world and mine.\"\r\n\r\nGordon reached a reassuring hand over to Leah. All memory of their\r\nquarrel was obliterated in the face of their present peril. He felt\r\nher slender fingers twine firmly with his. The warm contact gave them\r\nboth new courage.\r\n\r\n\"We of Xoran need your planet and intend to take possession of it,\"\r\nArlok continued, \"but the vast distance which separates Rigel from\r\nyour solar system makes it impracticable to transport any considerable\r\nnumber of our people here in space-cars for, though our space-cars\r\ntravel with practically the speed of light, it requires over five\r\nhundred and forty years for them to cross that great void. So I was\r\nsent as a lone pioneer to your Earth to do the work necessary here in\r\norder to open the Gate that will enable Xoran to cross the barrier in\r\nless than a minute of your time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"That gate is the one through the fourth dimension, for Xoran and your\r\nplanet in a four-dimensional universe are almost touching each other\r\nin spite of the great distance separating them in a three-dimensional\r\nuniverse. We of Xoran, being three-dimensional creatures like you\r\nEarthlings, can not even exist on a four-dimensional plane. But we\r\ncan, by the use of apparatus to open a Gate, pass through a thin\r\nsector of the fourth dimension and emerge in a far distant part of our\r\nthree-dimensional universe.\r\n\r\n\"The situation of our two worlds,\" Arlok continued, \"is somewhat like\r\nthat of two dots on opposite ends of a long strip of paper that is\r\ncurved almost into a circle. To two-dimensional beings capable only of\r\nrealizing and traveling along the two dimensions of the paper itself\r\nthose dots might be many feet apart, yet in the third dimension\r\nstraight across free space they might be separated by only the\r\nthousandth part of an inch. In order to take that short cut across the\r\nthird dimension the two-dimensional creatures of the paper would have\r\nonly to transform a small strip of the intervening space into a\r\ntwo-dimensional surface like their paper.\r\n\r\n\"They could, do this, of course, by the use of proper\r\nvibration-creating machinery, for all things in a material universe\r\nare merely a matter of vibration. We of Xoran plan to cross the\r\nbarrier of the fourth dimension by creating a narrow strip of\r\nvibrations powerful enough to exactly match and nullify those of the\r\nfourth dimension itself. The result will be that this narrow strip\r\nwill temporarily become an area of three dimensions only, an area over\r\nwhich we can safely pass from our world to yours.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArlok indicated one of the pieces of apparatus along the opposite wall\r\nof the room. It was an intricate arrangement of finely wound coils\r\nwith wires leading to scores of needle-like points which constantly\r\nshimmered and crackled with tiny blue-white flames. Thick cables ran\r\nto a bank of concave reflectors of some gleaming grayish metal.\r\n\r\n\"There is the apparatus which will supply the enormous power necessary\r\nto nullify the vibrations of the fourth dimensional barrier,\" Arlok\r\nexplained. \"It is a condenser and adapter of the cosmic force that you\r\ncall the Millikan rays. In Xoran a similar apparatus is already set up\r\nand finished, but the Gate can only be opened by simultaneous actions\r\nfrom both sides of the barrier. That is why I was sent on my long\r\njourney through space to do the necessary work here. I am now nearly\r\nfinished. A very few hours more will see the final opening of the\r\nGate. Then the fighting hordes of Xoran can sweep through the barrier\r\nand overwhelm your planet.\r\n\r\n\"When the Gate from Xoran to a new planet is first opened,\" Arlok\r\ncontinued, \"our scientists always like to have at least one pair of\r\nspecimens of the new world's inhabitants sent through to them for\r\nexperimental use. So to-night, while waiting for one of my final\r\ncastings to cool, I improved the time by making a brief raid upon the\r\nplace that you call the Maori Hut. The lady here seemed an excellent\r\ntype of your Earthling women, and the meteoric iron in her necklace\r\nmade a perfect focus for electric hypnosis. Her escort was too\r\ninferior a specimen to be of value to me so I killed him when he\r\nattempted to interfere. When you gave chase I lured you on until I\r\ncould see whether you might be usable. You proved an excellent\r\nspecimen, so I merely stunned you. Very soon now I shall be ready to\r\nsend the two of you through the Gate to our scientists in Xoran.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA cold wave of sheer horror swept over Gordon. It was impossible to\r\ndoubt the stark and deadly menace promised in the plan of this grim\r\nvisitor from an alien universe--a menace that loomed not only for\r\nGordon and Leah but for the teeming millions of a doomed and\r\ndefenseless world.\r\n\r\n\"Let me show you Xoran,\" Arlok offered. \"Then you may be better able\r\nto understand.\" He turned his back carelessly upon his two captives\r\nand strode over to the apparatus along the opposite wall.\r\n\r\nGordon longed to hurl himself upon the unprotected back of the\r\nretreating Xoranian, but he knew that any attempt of that kind would\r\nbe suicidal. Arlok's deadly tentacle would strike him down before he\r\nwas halfway across the room.\r\n\r\nHe searched his surroundings with desperate eyes for anything that\r\nmight serve as a weapon. Then his pulse quickened with sudden hope.\r\nThere on a small table near Leah was the familiar bulk of a .45\r\ncalibre revolver, loaded and ready for use. It was included in a\r\nmiscellaneous collection of other small earthly tools and objects that\r\nArlok had apparently collected for study.\r\n\r\nThere was an excellent chance that Leah might be able to secure the\r\ngun unobserved. Gordon pressed her fingers in a swift attempt at\r\nsignalling, then jerked his head ever so slightly toward the table. A\r\nmoment later the quick answering pressure of Leah's fingers told him\r\nthat she had understood his message. From the corner of his eye Gordon\r\nsaw Leah's other hand begin cautiously groping behind her for the\r\nrevolver.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen both Gordon and Leah froze into sudden immobility as Arlok faced\r\nthem again from beside an apparatus slightly reminiscent of an earthly\r\nradio set. Arlok threw a switch, and a small bank of tubes glowed pale\r\ngreen. A yard-square plate of bluish-gray metal on the wall above the\r\napparatus glowed with milky fluorescence.\r\n\r\n\"It is easy to penetrate the barrier with light waves,\" Arlok\r\nexplained. \"That is a Gate that can readily be opened from either\r\nside. It was through it that we first discovered your Earth.\"\r\n\r\nArlok threw a rheostat on to more power. The luminous plate cleared\r\nswiftly. \"And there, Earthlings, is Xoran!\" Arlok said proudly.\r\n\r\nLeah and Gordon gasped in sheer amaze as the glowing plate became a\r\nveritable window into another world--a world of utter and alien\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nThe livid light of a giant red sun blazed mercilessly down upon a\r\nlandscape from which every vestige of animal and plant life had\r\napparently been stripped. Naked rocks and barren soil stretched\r\nillimitably to the far horizon in a vast monotony of utter desolation.\r\n\r\nArlok twirled the knob of the apparatus, and another scene flashed\r\ninto view. In this scene great gleaming squares and cones of metal\r\nrose in towering clusters from the starkly barren land. Hordes of\r\ncreatures like Arlok swarmed in and around the metal buildings. Giant\r\nmachines whirled countless wheels in strange tasks. From a thousand\r\ngreat needle-like projections on the buildings spurted shimmering\r\nsheets of crackling flame, bathing the entire scene in a whirling mist\r\nof fiery vapors.\r\n\r\nGordon realized dimly that he must be looking into one of the cities\r\nof Xoran, but every detail of the chaotic whirl of activity was too\r\nutterly unfamiliar to carry any real significance to his bewildered\r\nbrain. He was as hopelessly overwhelmed as an African savage would be\r\nif transported suddenly into the heart of Times Square.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArlok again twirled the knob. The scene shifted, apparently to another\r\nplanet. This world was still alive, with rich verdure and swarming\r\nmillions of people strangely like those of Earth. But it was a doomed\r\nworld. The dread Gate to Xoran had already been opened here. Legions\r\nof bluish-gray Xoranians were attacking the planet's inhabitants, and\r\nthe attack of those metallic hosts was irresistible.\r\n\r\nThe slight bodies of the Xoranians seemed as impervious to bullets and\r\nmissiles as though armor-plated. The frantic defense of the\r\nbeleaguered people of the doomed planet caused hardly a casualty in\r\nthe Xoranian ranks.\r\n\r\nThe attack of the Xoranians was hideously effective. Clouds of dense\r\nyellow fog belched from countless projectors in the hands of the\r\nbluish-gray hosts, and beneath that deadly miasma all animal and plant\r\nlife on the doomed planet was crumbling, dying, and rotting into a\r\nliquid slime. Then even the slime was swiftly obliterated, and the\r\nXoranians were left triumphant upon a world starkly desolate.\r\n\r\n\"That was one of the minor planets in the swarm that make up the solar\r\nsystem of the sun that your astronomers call Canopus,\" Arlok\r\nexplained. \"Our first task in conquering a world is to rid it of the\r\nunclean surface scum of animal and plant life. When this noxious\r\nsurface mold is eliminated, the planet is then ready to furnish us\r\nsustenance, for we Xoranians live directly upon the metallic elements\r\nof the planet itself. Our bodies are of a substance of which your\r\nscientists have never even dreamed--deathless, invincible, living\r\nmetal!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArlok again twirled the control of the apparatus and the scene was\r\nshifted back to the planet of Xoran, this time to the interior of what\r\nwas apparently a vast laboratory. Here scores of Xoranian scientists\r\nwere working upon captives who were pathetically like human beings of\r\nEarth itself, working with lethal gases and deadly liquids as human\r\nscientists might experiment upon noxious pests. The details of the\r\nscene were so utterly revolting, the tortures that were being\r\ninflicted so starkly horrible, that Leah and Gordon sank back in their\r\nchairs sick and shaken.\r\n\r\nArlok snapped off a switch, and the green light in the tubes died.\r\n\"That last scene was the laboratory to which I shall send you two\r\npresently,\" he said callously as he started back across the room\r\ntoward them.\r\n\r\nGordon lurched to his feet, his brain a seething whirl of hate in\r\nwhich all thought of caution was gone as he tensed his muscles to hurl\r\nhimself upon that grim monstrosity from the bleak and desolate realm\r\nof Xoran.\r\n\r\nThen he felt Leah tugging surreptitiously at his right hand. The next\r\nmoment the bulk of something cold and hard met his fingers. It was the\r\nrevolver. Leah had secured it while Arlok was busy with his\r\ninter-dimensional televisor.\r\n\r\nArlok was rapidly approaching them. Gordon hoped against hope that the\r\nmenace of that deadly tentacle might be diverted for the fraction of a\r\nsecond necessary for him to get in a crippling shot. Leah seemed to\r\ndivine his thought. She suddenly screamed hysterically and flung\r\nherself on the floor almost at Arlok's feet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArlok stopped in obvious wonder and bent over Leah. Gordon took\r\ninstant advantage of the Xoranian's diverted attention. He whipped the\r\nrevolver from behind him and fired point-blank at Arlok's unprotected\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe bullet struck squarely, but Arlok was not even staggered. A tiny\r\nspot of bluish-gray skin upon his oval skull gleamed faintly for a\r\nmoment under the bullet's impact. Then the heavy pellet of lead, as\r\nthoroughly flattened as though it had struck the triple armor of a\r\nbattleship, dropped spent and harmless to the floor.\r\n\r\nArlok straightened swiftly. For the moment he seemed to have no\r\nthought of retaliating with his deadly tentacle. He merely stood there\r\nquite still with one thin arm thrown up to guard his glowing eyes.\r\n\r\nGordon sent the remainder of the revolver's bullets crashing home as\r\nfast as his finger could press the trigger. At that murderously short\r\nrange the smashing rain of lead should have dropped a charging\r\ngorilla. But for all the effect Gordon's shots had upon the Xoranian,\r\nhis ammunition might as well have been pellets of paper. Arlok's\r\nglossy hide merely, glowed momentarily in tiny patches as the bullets\r\nstruck and flattened harmlessly--and that was all.\r\n\r\nHis last cartridge fired, Gordon flung the empty weapon squarely at\r\nthe blue monstrosity's hideous face. Arlok made no attempt to dodge.\r\nThe heavy revolver struck him high on the forehead, then rebounded\r\nharmlessly to the floor. Arlok paid no more attention to the blow than\r\na man would to the casual touch of a wind-blown feather.\r\n\r\nGordon desperately flung himself forward upon the Xoranian in one last\r\nmad effort to overwhelm him. Arlok dodged Gordon's wild blows, then\r\ngently swept the Earth man into the embrace of his thin arms. For one\r\nhelpless moment Gordon sensed the incredible strength and adamantine\r\nhardness of the Xoranian's slender figure, together with an\r\noverwhelming impression of colossal weight in that deceptively slight\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen Arlok contemptuously flung Gordon away from him. As Gordon\r\nstaggered backward, Arlok's tentacle lashed upward and levelled upon\r\nhim. Its twin tips again glowed brilliant green and livid blue.\r\nInstantly every muscle in Gordon's body was paralyzed. He stood there\r\nas rigid as a statue, his body completely deadened from the neck down.\r\nBeside him stood Leah, also frozen motionless in that same weird\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\"Earthling, you are beginning to try my patience,\" Arlok snapped. \"Can\r\nyou not realize that I am utterly invincible in any combat with you?\r\nThe living metal of my body weighs over sixteen hundred pounds, as you\r\nmeasure weight. The strength inherent in that metal is sufficient to\r\ntear a hundred of your Earth men to shreds. But I do not even have to\r\ntouch you to vanquish you. The electric content of my bodily structure\r\nis so infinitely superior to yours that with this tentacle-organ of\r\nmine I can instantly short-circuit the feeble currents of your nerve\r\nimpulses and bring either paralysis or death as I choose.\r\n\r\n\"But enough of this!\" Arlok broke off abruptly. \"My materials are now\r\nready, and it is time that I finished my work. I shall put you out of\r\nmy way for a few hours until I am ready to send you through the Gate\r\nto the laboratories of Xoran.\"\r\n\r\nThe green and blue fire of the tentacle's tips flamed to dazzling\r\nbrightness. The paralysis of Gordon's body swept swiftly over his\r\nbrain. Black oblivion engulfed him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Gordon again recovered consciousness he found that he was lying\r\non the floor of what was apparently a narrow hall, near the foot of a\r\nstairway. His hands were lashed tightly behind him, and his feet and\r\nlegs were so firmly pinioned together that he could scarcely move.\r\n\r\nBeside him lay Leah, also tightly bound. A short distance down the\r\nhall was the closed door of Arlok's work-room, recognizable by the\r\nthin line of red light gleaming beneath it.\r\n\r\nMoonlight through a window at the rear of the hall made objects around\r\nGordon fairly clear. He looked at Leah and saw tears glistening on her\r\nlong lashes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Blair, I was afraid you'd never waken again,\" the girl sobbed. \"I\r\nthought that fiend had killed you!\" Her voice broke hysterically.\r\n\r\n\"Steady, darling,\" Gordon said soothingly. \"We simply can't give up\r\nnow, you know. If that monstrosity ever opens that accursed Gate of\r\nhis our entire world is doomed. There must be some way to stop him.\r\nWe've got to find that way and try it--even if it seems only one\r\nforlorn chance in a million.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGordon shook his head to clear the numbness still lingering from the\r\neffect of Arlok's tentacle. The Xoranian seemed unable to produce a\r\nparalysis of any great duration with his weird natural weapon.\r\nAccordingly, he had been forced to bind his captives like two trussed\r\nfowls while he returned to his labors.\r\n\r\nLying close together as they were, it was a comparatively easy matter\r\nfor them to get their bound hands within reach of each other, but\r\nafter fifteen minutes of vain work Gordon realized that any attempt at\r\nuntying the ropes was useless. Arlok's prodigious strength had drawn\r\nthe knots so tight that no human power could ever loosen them.\r\n\r\nThen Gordon suddenly thought of the one thing in his pockets that\r\nmight help them. It was a tiny cigarette lighter, of the\r\nspring-trigger type. It was in his vest pocket completely out of reach\r\nof his bound hands, but there was a way out of that difficulty.\r\n\r\nGordon and Leah twisted and rolled their bodies like two\r\ncontortionists until they succeeded in getting into such a position\r\nthat Leah was able to get her teeth in the cloth of the vest pocket's\r\nedge. A moment of desperate tugging, then the fabric gave way. The\r\nlighter dropped from the torn pocket to the floor, where Leah\r\nretrieved it.\r\n\r\nThen they twisted their bodies back to back. Leah managed to get the\r\nlighter flaming in her bound hands. Gordon groped in an effort to\r\nguide the ropes on his wrists over the tiny flickering flame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen there came the faint welcome odor of smoldering rope as the\r\nlighter's tiny flame bit into the bonds. Gordon bit his lips to\r\nsuppress a cry of pain as the flame seared into his skin as well. The\r\nflame bit deeper into the rope. A single strand snapped.\r\n\r\nThen another strand gave way. To Gordon the process seemed endless as\r\nthe flame scorched rope and flesh alike. A long minute of lancing\r\nagony that seemed hours--then Gordon could stand no more. He tensed\r\nhis muscles in one mighty agonized effort to end the torture of the\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nThe weakened rope gave way completely beneath that pain-maddened\r\nlunge. Gordon's hands were free. It was an easy matter now to use the\r\nlighter to finish freeing himself and Leah. They made their way\r\nswiftly back to the window at the rear of the hall. It slid silently\r\nupward. A moment later, and they were out in the brilliant\r\nmoonlight--free.\r\n\r\nThey made their way around to the front of the house. Behind the drawn\r\nshades of one of the front rooms an eery glow of red light marked the\r\nlocation of Arlok's work-room. They heard the occasional clink of\r\ntools inside the room as the Xoranian diligently worked to complete\r\nhis apparatus.\r\n\r\nThey crept stealthily up to where one of the French windows of Arlok's\r\nwork-room swung slightly ajar. Through the narrow crevice they could\r\nsee Arlok's grotesque back as he labored over the complex assembly of\r\napparatus against the wall.\r\n\r\nA heavy stone flung through the window would probably wreck that\r\ndelicate mechanism completely, yet the two watchers knew that such a\r\nrespite would be only a temporary one. As long as Arlok remained alive\r\non this planet to build other gates to Xoran, Earth's eventual doom\r\nwas certain. Complete destruction of Arlok himself was Earth's only\r\nhope of salvation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Xoranian seemed to be nearing the end of his labors. He left the\r\napparatus momentarily and walked over to a work-bench where he picked\r\nup a slender rod-like tool. Donning a heavy glove to shield his left\r\nhand, he selected a small plate of bluish-gray metal, then pressed a\r\nswitch in the handle of the tool in his right hand.\r\n\r\nA blade of blinding white flame, seemingly as solid as a blade of\r\nmetal, spurted for the length of a foot from the tool's tip. Arlok\r\nbegan cutting the plate with the flame, the blade shearing through the\r\nheavy metal as easily as a hot knife shears through butter.\r\n\r\nThe sight brought a sudden surge of exultant hope to Gordon. He\r\nswiftly drew Leah away from the window, far enough to the side that\r\ntheir low-voiced conversation could not be heard from inside the\r\nwork-room.\r\n\r\n\"Leah, there is our one chance!\" he explained excitedly. \"That blue\r\nfiend _is_ vulnerable, and that flame-tool of his is the weapon to\r\nreach his vulnerability. Did you notice how careful he was to shield\r\nhis other hand with a glove before he turned the tool on? He can be\r\nhurt by that blade of flame, and probably hurt badly.\"\r\n\r\nLeah nodded in quick understanding. \"If I could lure him out of the\r\nroom for just a moment, you could slip in through the window and get\r\nthat flame-tool, Blair,\" she suggested eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"That might work,\" Gordon agreed reluctantly. \"But, Leah, don't run\r\nany more risks than you absolutely have to!\" He picked up a small\r\nrock. \"Here, take this with you. Open the door into the hall and\r\nattract Arlok's attention by throwing the rock at his precious\r\napparatus. Then the minute he sees you, try to escape out through the\r\nhall again. He'll leave his work to follow you. When he returns to his\r\nwork-room I'll be in there waiting for him. And I'll be waiting with a\r\nweapon that can stab through even that armor-plated hide of his!\"\r\n\r\nThey separated, Leah to enter the house, Gordon to return to the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArlok was back over in front of the apparatus, fitting into place the\r\npiece of metal he had just cut. The flame-tool, its switch now turned\r\noff, was still on the work-bench.\r\n\r\nGordon's heart pounded with excitement as he crouched there with his\r\neyes fixed upon the closed hall door. The minutes seemed to drag\r\ninterminably. Then suddenly Gordon's muscles tensed. The knob of the\r\nhall door had turned ever so slightly. Leah was at her post!\r\n\r\nThe next moment the door was flung open with a violence that sent it\r\nslamming back against the wall. The slender figure of Leah stood\r\nframed in the opening, her dark eyes blazing as she flung one hand up\r\nto hurl her missile.\r\n\r\nArlok whirled just as Leah threw the rock straight at the intricate\r\nGate-opening apparatus. With the speed of thought the Xoranian flung\r\nhis own body over to shield his fragile instruments. The rock thudded\r\nharmlessly against his metallic chest.\r\n\r\nThen Arlok's tentacle flung out like a striking cobra, its forked tip\r\nflaming blue and green fire as it focussed upon the open door. But\r\nLeah was already gone. Gordon heard her flying footsteps as she raced\r\ndown the hall. Arlok promptly sped after her in swift pursuit.\r\n\r\nAs Arlok passed through the door into the hall Gordon flung himself\r\ninto the room, and sped straight for the work-bench. He snatched the\r\nflame-tool up, then darted over to the wall by the door. He was not a\r\nsecond too soon. The heavy tread of Arlok's return was already audible\r\nin the hall just outside.\r\n\r\nGordon prepared to stake everything upon his one slim chance of\r\ndisabling that fearful tentacle before Arlok could bring it into\r\naction. He pressed the tiny switch in the flame-tool's handle just as\r\nArlok came through the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArlok, startled by the glare of the flame-tool's blazing blade,\r\nwhirled toward Gordon--but too late. That thin searing shaft of vivid\r\nflame had already struck squarely at the base of the Xoranian's\r\ntentacle. A seething spray of hissing sparks marked the place where\r\nthe flame bit deeply home. Arlok screamed, a ghastly metallic note of\r\nanguish like nothing human.\r\n\r\nThe Xoranian's powerful hands clutched at Gordon, but he leaped\r\nlithely backward out of their reach. Then Gordon again attacked, the\r\nflame-tool's shining blade licking in and out like a rapier. The\r\nsearing flame swept across one of Arlok's arms, and the Xoranian\r\nwinced. Then the blade stabbed swiftly at Arlok's waist. Arlok\r\nhalf-doubled as he flinched back. Gordon shifted his aim with\r\nlightning speed and sent the blade of flame lashing in one accurate\r\nterrible stroke that caught Arlok squarely in the eyes.\r\n\r\nAgain Arlok screamed in intolerable agony as that tearing flame\r\ndarkened forever his glowing eyes. In berserker fury the tortured\r\nXoranian charged blindly toward Gordon. Gordon warily dodged to one\r\nside. Arlok, sightless, and with his tentacle crippled, still had\r\nenough power in that mighty metallic body of his to tear a hundred\r\nEarth men to pieces.\r\n\r\nGordon stung Arlok's shoulder with the flame, then desperately leaped\r\nto one side just in time to dodge a flailing blow that would have made\r\npulp of his body had it landed.\r\n\r\nArlok went stark wild in his frenzied efforts to come to grips with\r\nhis unseen adversary. Furniture crashed and splintered to kindling\r\nwood beneath his threshing feet. Even the stout walls of the room\r\nshivered and cracked as the incredible weight of Arlok's body caromed\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGordon circled lithely around the crippled blue monstrosity like a\r\ntimber wolf circling a wounded moose. He began concentrating his\r\nattack upon Arlok's left leg. Half a dozen deep slashes with the\r\nsearing flame--then suddenly the thin leg crumpled and broke. Arlok\r\ncrashed helplessly to the floor.\r\n\r\nGordon was now able to shift his attack to Arlok's head. Dodging the\r\nblindly flailing arms of the Xoranian, he stabbed again and again at\r\nthat oval-shaped skull.\r\n\r\nThe searing thrusts began to have their effect. Arlok's convulsive\r\nmovements became slower and weaker. Gordon sent the flame stabbing in\r\na long final thrust in an attempt to pierce through to that alien\r\nmetal brain.\r\n\r\nWith startling suddenness the flame burned its way home to some\r\nunknown center of life force in the oval skull. There was a brief but\r\nappalling gush of bright purple flame from Arlok's eye-sockets and\r\nmouth orifice. Then his twitching body stiffened. His bluish-gray hide\r\ndarkened with incredible swiftness into a dull black. Arlok was dead.\r\n\r\nGordon, sickened at the grisly ending to the battle, snapped off the\r\nflame-tool and turned to search for Leah. He found her already\r\nstanding in the hall door, alive, and unhurt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I escaped through the window at the end of the hall,\" she explained.\r\n\"Arlok quit following me as soon as he saw that you too were gone from\r\nwhere he had left us tied.\" She shuddered as she looked down at the\r\nXoranian's mangled body. \"I saw most of your fight with him, Blair. It\r\nwas terrible; awful. But, Blair, we've won!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and now we'll make sure of the fruits of our victory,\" Gordon\r\nsaid grimly, starting over toward the Gate-opening apparatus with the\r\nflame-tool in his hand. A very few minutes' work with the shearing\r\nblade of flame reduced the intricate apparatus to a mere tangled pile\r\nof twisted metal.\r\n\r\nArlok, Gate-opener of Xoran, was dead--and the Gate to that grim\r\nplanet was now irrevocably closed!\r\n\r\n\"Blair, do you feel it too, that eery feeling of countless eyes still\r\nwatching us from Xoran?\" There was frank awe in Leah's half-whispered\r\nquestion. \"You know Arlok said that they had watched us for centuries\r\nfrom their side of the barrier. I'm sure they're watching us now. Will\r\nthey send another Opener of Gates to take up the work where Arlok\r\nfailed?\"\r\n\r\nGordon took Leah into his arms. \"I don't know, dear,\" he admitted\r\ngravely. \"They may send another messenger, but I doubt it. This world\r\nof ours has had its warning, and it will heed it. The watchers on\r\nXoran must know that in the five hundred and forty years it would take\r\ntheir next messenger to get here, the Earth will have had more than\r\nenough time to prepare an adequate defense for even Xoran's menace. I\r\ndoubt if there will ever again be an attempt made to open the Gate to\r\nXoran.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The great ship tore apart._]\r\n\r\nThe Eye of Allah\r\n\r\n_By C. D. Willard_\r\n\r\n    On the fatal seventh of September a certain Secret Service man\r\n    sat in the President's chair and--looked back into the Eye of\r\n    Allah.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlinky Collins' part in this matter was very brief. Blinky lasted just\r\nlong enough to make a great discovery, to brag about it as was\r\nBlinky's way, and then pass on to find his reward in whatever\r\nhereafter is set apart for weak-minded crooks whose heads are not hard\r\nenough to withstand the crushing impact of a lead-filled pacifier.\r\n\r\nThe photograph studio of Blinky Collins was on the third floor of a\r\ndisreputable building in an equally unsavory part of Chicago. There\r\nwere no tinted pictures of beautiful blondes nor of stern,\r\nsquare-jawed men of affairs in Blinky's reception room. His clients,\r\nwho came furtively there, were strongly opposed to having their\r\npictures taken--they came for other purposes. For the photographic\r\nwork of Mr. Collins was strictly commercial--and peculiar. There were\r\nfingerprints to be photographed and identified for purpose of private\r\nrevenge, photographs of people to be merged and repictured in\r\ncompromising closeness for reasons of blackmail. And even X-Ray\r\nphotography was included in the scope of his work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great discovery came when a box was brought to the dingy room and\r\nMr. Collins was asked to show what was inside it without the bother\r\nand inconvenience of disturbing lock and seals. The X-Ray machine\r\nsizzled above it, and a photographic plate below was developed to show\r\na string of round discs that could easily have been pearls.\r\n\r\nThe temporary possessor of the box was pleased with the result--but\r\nBlinky was puzzled. For the developer had brought out an odd result.\r\nThere were the pearls as expected, but, too, there was a small picture\r\nsuperimposed--a picture of a bald head and a body beneath seated\r\nbeside a desk. The picture had been taken from above looking straight\r\ndown, and head and desk were familiar.\r\n\r\nBlinky knew them both. The odd part was that he knew also that both of\r\nthem were at that instant on the ground floor of the same disreputable\r\nbuilding, directly under and two floors below his workshop.\r\n\r\nLike many great discoveries, this of Blinky's came as the result of an\r\naccident. He had monkeyed with the X-Ray generator and had made\r\ncertain substitutions. And here was the result--a bald head and a\r\ndesk, photographed plainly through two heavy wood floors. Blinky\r\nscratched his own head in deep thought. And then he repeated the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThis time there was a blonde head close to the bald one, and two\r\npeople were close to the desk and to each other. Blinky knew then that\r\nthere were financial possibilities in this new line of portrait work.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the rat eyes of the inventor were able to see\r\nexactly what they wanted through this strange device, but Blinky\r\nlearned. And he fitted a telescope back of the ray and found that he\r\ncould look along it and see as if through a great funnel what was\r\ntranspiring blocks and blocks away; he looked where he would, and\r\nbrick walls or stone were like glass when the new ray struck through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBlinky never knew what he had--never dreamed of the tremendous\r\npotentialities in his oscillating ethereal ray that had a range and\r\npenetration beyond anything known. But he knew, in a vague way, that\r\nthis ray was a channel for light waves to follow, and he learned that\r\nhe could vary the range of the ray and that whatever light was shown\r\nat the end of that range came to him as clear and distinct as if he\r\nwere there in the room.\r\n\r\nHe sat for hours, staring through the telescope. He would train the\r\ndevice upon a building across the street, then cut down the current\r\nuntil the unseen vibration penetrated inside the building. If there\r\nwas nothing there of interest he would gradually increase the power,\r\nand the ray would extend out and still out into other rooms and beyond\r\nthem to still others. Blinky had a lot of fun, but he never forgot the\r\npractical application of the device--practical, that is, from the\r\ndistorted viewpoint of a warped mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I've heard about your machine,\" said a pasty-faced man one day, as he\r\nsat in Blinky's room, \"and I think it's a lot of hooey. But I'd give\r\njust one grand to know who is with the district attorney this minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\" asked Blinky.\r\n\r\n\"Two blocks down the street, in the station house ... and if Pokey\r\nBarnard is with him, the lousy stool-pigeon--\"\r\n\r\nBlinky paid no attention to the other's opinion of one Pokey Barnard;\r\nhe was busy with a sputtering blue light and a telescope behind a\r\nshield of heavy lead.\r\n\r\n\"Put your money on the table,\" he said, finally: \"there's the dicks ...\r\nand there's Pokey. Take a look--\"\r\n\r\nIt was some few minutes later that Blinky learned of another valuable\r\nfeature in his ray. He was watching the district attorney when the\r\npasty-faced man brushed against a hanging incandescent light. There\r\nwas a bit of bare wire exposed, and as it swung into the ray the fuses\r\nin the Collins studio blew out instantly.\r\n\r\nBut the squinting eyes at the telescope had seen something first. They\r\nhad seen the spare form of the district attorney throw itself from the\r\nchair as if it had been dealt a blow--or had received an electric\r\nshock.\r\n\r\nBlinky put in new fuses--heavier ones--and tried it again on another\r\nsubject. And again the man at the receiving end got a shot of current\r\nthat sent him sprawling.\r\n\r\n\"Now what the devil--\" demanded Blinky. He stood off and looked at the\r\nmachine, the wire with its 110 volts, the invisible ray that was\r\nstreaming out.\r\n\r\n\"It's insulated, the machine is,\" he told his caller, \"so the juice\r\nwon't shoot back if I keep my hands off; but why,\" he demanded\r\nprofanely, \"don't it short on the first thing it touches?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was picturing vaguely a ray like a big insulated cable, with light\r\nand current both traveling along a core at its center, cut off,\r\ninsulated by the ray, so that only the bare end where the ray stopped\r\ncould make contact.\r\n\r\n\"Some more of them damn electrons,\" he hazarded; then demanded of his\r\ncaller: \"But am I one hell of a smart guy? Or am I?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no denying this fact. The pasty-faced man told Blinky with\r\nlurid emphasis just how smart. He had seen with his own eyes and this\r\nwas too good to keep.\r\n\r\nHe paid his one grand and departed, first to make certain necessary\r\narrangements for the untimely end of one Pokey Barnard, squealer,\r\nlouse, et cetera, et cetera, and then to spread the glad news through\r\nthe underworld of Collins' invention.\r\n\r\nThat was Blinky's big mistake, as was shown a few days later. Not many\r\nhad taken seriously the account of the photographer's experiments, but\r\nthere was one who had, as was evident. A bearded man, whose eyes\r\nstared somewhat wildly from beneath a shock of frowzy hair, entered\r\nthe Collins work-room and locked the door behind him. His English was\r\nimperfect, but the heavy automatic in his hand could not be\r\nmisunderstood. He forced the trembling inventor to give a\r\ndemonstration, and the visitor's face showed every evidence of\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\"The cur-rent,\" he demanded with careful words, \"the electreek\r\ncur-rent, you shall do also. Yes?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the automatic brought quick assent, and again the visitor showed\r\nhis complete satisfaction. Showed it by slugging the inventor quietly\r\nand efficiently and packing the apparatus in the big suitcase he had\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nBlinky Collins had been fond of that machine. He had found a form of\r\ntelevision with uncounted possibilities, and it had been for him the\r\nperfect instrument of a blackmailing Peeping Tom; he had learned the\r\nsecret of directed wireless transmission of power and had seen it as a\r\nmeans for annoying his enemies. Yet Blinky Collins--the late Blinky\r\nCollins--offered no least objection, when the bearded man walked off\r\nwith the machine. His body, sprawled awkwardly in the corner, was\r\nquite dead....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now, some two months later, in his Washington office, the Chief of\r\nthe United States Secret Service pushed a paper across his desk to a\r\nwaiting man and leaned back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"What would you make of that, Del?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nRobert Delamater reached leisurely for the paper. He regarded it with\r\nsleepy, half-closed eyes.\r\n\r\nThere was a crude drawing of an eye at the top. Below was printed--not\r\nwritten--a message in careful, precise letters: \"Take warning. The Eye\r\nof Allah is upon you. You shall instructions receive from time to\r\ntime. Follow them. Obey.\"\r\n\r\nDelamater laughed. \"Why ask me what I think of a nut letter like that.\r\nYou've had plenty of them just as crazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"This didn't come to me,\" said the Chief; \"it was addressed to the\r\nPresident of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there will be others, and we will run the poor sap down.\r\nNothing out of the ordinary I should say.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I thought--at first. Read this--\" The big, heavy-set man\r\npushed another and similar paper across the desk. \"This one was\r\naddressed to the Secretary of State.\"\r\n\r\nDelamater did not read it at once. He held both papers to the light;\r\nhis fingers touched the edges only.\r\n\r\n\"No watermark,\" he mused; \"ordinary white writing stock--sold in all\r\nthe five and ten cent stores. Tried these for fingerprints I\r\nsuppose?\".\r\n\r\n\"Read it,\" suggested the Chief.\r\n\r\n\"Another picture of an eye,\" said Delamater aloud, and read: \"'Warning.\r\nYou are dealing with an emissary from a foreign power who is an\r\nunfriend of my country. See him no more. This is the first and last\r\nwarning. The Eye of Allah watches.'\r\n\r\n\"And what is this below--? 'He did not care for your cigars, Mr.\r\nSecretary. Next time--but there must be no next time.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDelamater read slowly--lazily. He seemed only slightly interested\r\nexcept when he came to the odd conclusion of the note. But the Chief\r\nknew Delamater and knew how that slow indolence could give place to a\r\nfeverish, alert concentration when work was to be done.\r\n\r\n\"Crazy as a loon,\" was the man's conclusion as he dropped the papers\r\nupon the desk.\r\n\r\n\"Crazy,\" his chief corrected, \"like a fox! Read the last line again;\r\nthen get this--\r\n\r\n\"The Secretary of State _is_ meeting with a foreign agent who is here\r\nvery much incog. Came in as a servant of a real ambassador. Slipped\r\nquietly into Washington, and not a soul knew he was here. He met the\r\nSecretary in a closed room; no one saw him come or leave--\";\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Secretary tells me that in that room where nobody could see\r\nhe offered this man a cigar. His visitor took it, tried to smoke it,\r\napologized--and lit one of his own vile cigarettes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hm-m!\" Delamater sat a little straighter in his chair; his eyebrows\r\nwere raised now in questioning astonishment. \"Dictaphone? Some\r\nemployee of the Department listening in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now that begins to be interesting,\" the other conceded. His eyes had\r\nlost their sleepy look. \"Want me to take it on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Later. Right now. I want you to take this visiting gentleman under\r\nyour personal charge. Here is the name and the room and hotel where he\r\nis staying. He is to meet with the Secretary to-night--he knows where.\r\nYou will get to him unobserved--absolutely unseen; I can leave that to\r\nyou. Take him yourself to his appointment, and take him without a\r\nbrass band. But have what men you want tail you and watch out for\r\nspies.... Then, when he is through, bring him back and deliver him\r\nsafely to his room. Compray?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right--give me Wilkins and Smeed. I rather think I can get this bird\r\nthere and back without being seen, but perhaps they may catch Allah\r\nkeeping tabs on us at that.\" He laughed amusedly as he took the paper\r\nwith the name and address.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA waiter with pencil and order-pad might have been seen some hours\r\nlater going as if from the kitchen to the ninth floor of a Washington\r\nhotel. And the same waiter, a few minutes later, was escorting a guest\r\nfrom a rear service-door to an inconspicuous car parked nearby. The\r\nwaiter slipped behind the wheel.\r\n\r\nA taxi, whose driver was half asleep, was parked a hundred feet behind\r\nthem at the curb. As they drove away and no other sign of life was\r\nseen in the quiet street the driver of the taxi yawned ostentatiously\r\nand decided to seek a new stand. He neglected possible fares until a\r\nman he called Smeed hailed him a block farther on. They followed\r\nslowly after the first car ... and they trailed it again on its return\r\nafter some hours.\r\n\r\n\"Safe as a church,\" they reported to the driver of the first car.\r\n\"We'll swear that nobody was checking up on that trip.\"\r\n\r\nAnd: \"O. K.\" Delamater reported to his chief the next morning. \"Put\r\none over on this self-appointed Allah that time.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Chief did not reply: he was looking at a slip of paper like\r\nthose he had shown his operative the day before. He tossed it to\r\nDelamater and took up the phone.\r\n\r\n\"To the Secretary of State,\" Delamater read. \"You had your warning.\r\nNext time you disobey it shall be you who dies.\"\r\n\r\nThe signature was only the image of an eye.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chief was calling a number; Delamater recognized it as that of the\r\nhotel he had visited. \"Manager, please, at once,\" the big man was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\nHe identified himself to the distant man. Then: \"Please check up on\r\nthe man in nine four seven. If he doesn't answer, enter the room and\r\nreport at once--I will hold the phone....\"\r\n\r\nThe man at the desk tapped steadily with a pencil; Robert Delamater\r\nsat quietly, tensely waiting. But some sixth sense told him what the\r\nanswer would be. He was not surprised when the Chief repeated what the\r\nphone had whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Dead?... Yes!... Leave everything absolutely undisturbed. We will be\r\nright over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get Doctor Brooks, Del,\" he said quietly; \"the Eye of Allah was\r\nwatching after all.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Delamater was silent as they drove to the hotel. Where had he\r\nslipped? He trusted Smeed and Wilkins entirely; if they said his car\r\nhad not been followed it had not. And the visitor had been disguised;\r\nhe had seen to that. Then, where had this person stood--this being who\r\ncalled himself the Eye of Allah?\r\n\r\n\"Chief,\" he said finally. \"I didn't slip--nor Wilkins or Smeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Someone did,\" replied the big man, \"and it wasn't the Eye of Allah,\r\neither.\"\r\n\r\nThe manager of the hotel was waiting to take them to the room. He\r\nunlocked the door with his pass key.\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing touched,\" he assured the Secret Service men; \"there he\r\nis, just the way we found him.\"\r\n\r\nIn the doorway between the bedroom and bath a body was huddled. Doctor\r\nBrooks knelt quickly beside it. His hands worked swiftly for a moment,\r\nthen he rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Dead,\" he announced.\r\n\r\n\"How long?\" asked the Chief.\r\n\r\n\"Some time. Hours I should say--perhaps eight or ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cause?\" the query was brief.\r\n\r\n\"It will take an autopsy to determine that. There is no blood or wound\r\nto be seen.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe doctor was again examining the partly rigid body. He opened one\r\nhand; it held a cake of soap. There was a grease mark on the hand.\r\n\r\nDelamater supplied the explanation. \"He touched some grease on the old\r\ncar I was using,\" he said. \"Must have gone directly to wash it off.\r\nSee--there is water spilled on the floor.\"\r\n\r\nWater had indeed been splashed on the tile floor of the bath room; a\r\npool of it still remained about the heavy, foreign-looking shoes of\r\nthe dead man.\r\n\r\nSomething in it caught Delamater's eye. He leaned down to pick up\r\nthree pellets of metal, like small shot, round and shining.\r\n\r\n\"I'll keep these,\" he said, \"though the man was never killed with shot\r\nas small as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to wait for the autopsy report,\" said the Chief\r\ncrisply; \"that may give the cause of death. Was there anyone in the\r\nroom--did you enter it with him last night, Del?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the operative; \"he was very much agitated when we got\r\nhere--dismissed me rather curtly at the door. He was quite upset about\r\nsomething--spoke English none too well and said something about a\r\nwarning and damned our Secret Service as inefficient.\"\r\n\r\n\"A warning!\" said the Chief. The dead man's brief case was on the bed.\r\nHe crossed to it and undid the straps; the topmost paper told the\r\nreason for the man's disquiet. It showed the familiar, staring eye.\r\nAnd beneath the eye was a warning: this man was to die if he did not\r\nleave Washington at once.\r\n\r\nThe Chief turned to the hotel manager. \"Was the door locked?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is a spring lock. Someone could have gone out and closed it\r\nafter him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not this time. The dead-bolt was thrown. It takes a key to do that\r\nfrom the outside or this thumb-turn on the inside.\" The hotel man\r\ndemonstrated the action of the heavy bolt.\r\n\r\n\"Then, with a duplicate key, a man could have left this room and\r\nlocked the door behind him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely not. The floor-clerk was on duty all night. I have\r\nquestioned her: this room was under her eyes all the time. She saw\r\nthis man return, saw your man, here\"--and he pointed to\r\nDelamater--\"leave him at the door. There was no person left the room\r\nafter that.\"\r\n\r\n\"See about the autopsy, Doctor,\" the Chief ordered.\r\n\r\nAnd to the manager: \"Not a thing here must be touched. Admit only Mr.\r\nDelamater and no one else unless he vouches for them.\r\n\r\n\"Del,\" he told the operative, \"I'm giving you a chance to make up for\r\nlast night. Go to it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Robert Delamater \"went to it\" with all the thoroughness at his\r\ncommand, and with a total lack of result.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe autopsy helped not at all. The man was dead; it was apparently a\r\nnatural death. \"Not a scratch nor a mark on him,\" was the report. But:\r\n\"... next time it will be you,\" the note with the staring eye had\r\nwarned the Secretary of State. The writer of it was taking full credit\r\nfor the mysterious death.\r\n\r\nRobert Delamater had three small bits of metal, like tiny shot, and he\r\nracked his brain to connect these with the death. There were\r\nfingerprints, too, beautifully developed upon the mysterious\r\nmissives--prints that tallied with none in the records. There were\r\nanalyses of the paper--of the ink--and not a clue in any of them.\r\n\r\nJust three pellets of metal. Robert Delamater had failed utterly, and\r\nhe was bitter in the knowledge of his failure.\r\n\r\n\"He had you spotted, Del,\" the Chief insisted. \"The writer of these\r\nnotes may be crazy, but he was clever enough to know that this man\r\n_did_ see the Secretary. And he was waiting for him when he came back;\r\nthen he killed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Without a mark?\"\r\n\r\n\"He killed him,\" the Chief repeated; \"then he left--and that's that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" Delamater objected, \"the room clerk--\"\r\n\r\n\"--took a nap,\" broke in the Chief. But Delamater could not be\r\nsatisfied with the explanation.\r\n\r\n\"He got his, all right,\" he conceded, \"--got it in a locked room nine\r\nstories above the street, with no possible means of bringing it upon\r\nhimself--and no way for the murderer to escape. I tell you there is\r\nsomething more to this: just the letter to the Secretary, as if this\r\nEye of Allah were spying upon him--\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief waved all that aside. \"A clever spy,\" he insisted. \"Too\r\nclever for you. And a darn good guesser; he had us all fooled. But\r\nwe're dealing with a madman, not a ghost, and he didn't sail in\r\nthrough a ninth story window nor go out through a locked door; neither\r\ndid he spy on the Secretary of State in his private office. Don't try\r\nto make a supernatural mystery out of a failure, Del.\"\r\n\r\nThe big man's words were tempered with a laugh, but there was an edge\r\nof sarcasm, ill-concealed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd then came the next note. And the next. The letters were mailed at\r\nvarious points in and about the city; they came in a flood. And they\r\nwere addressed to the President of the United States, to the Secretary\r\nof War--of the Navy--to all the Cabinet members. And all carried the\r\nsame threat under the staring eye.\r\n\r\nThe United States, to this man, represented all that was tyrannical\r\nand oppressive to the downtrodden of the earth. He proposed to end\r\nit--this government first, then others in their turn. It was the\r\noutpouring of a wildly irrational mind that came to the office of the\r\nharassed Chief of the United States Secret Service, who had\r\ninstructions to run this man down--this man who signed himself The Eye\r\nof Allah. And do it quickly for the notes were threatening. Official\r\nWashington, it seemed, was getting jumpy and was making caustic\r\ninquiries as to why a Secret Service department was maintained.\r\n\r\nThe Chief, himself, was directing the investigation--and getting\r\nnowhere.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the latest,\" he said one morning. \"Mailed at New York.\"\r\nDelamater and a dozen other operatives were in his office: he showed\r\nthem a letter printed like all the others. There was the eye, and\r\nbeneath were words that made the readers catch their breath.\r\n\r\n\"The Eye of Allah sees--it has warned--now it will destroy. The day of\r\njudgment is at hand. The battleship _Maryland_ is at anchor in the\r\nHudson River at New York. No more shall it be the weapon of a despot\r\ngovernment. It will be destroyed at twelve o'clock on September\r\nfifth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wild talk,\" said the Chief, \"but today is the fourth. The Commander\r\nof the _Maryland_ has been warned--approach by air or water will be\r\nimpossible. I want you men to patrol the shore and nail this man if he\r\nshows up. Lord knows what he intends--bluffing probably--but he may\r\ntry some fool stunt. If he does--get him!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEleven-thirty by the watch on Robert Delamater's wrist found him\r\nseated in the bow of a speed-boat the following morning. They\r\npatrolled slowly up and down the shore. There were fellow operatives,\r\nhe knew, scores of them, posted at all points of vantage along the\r\ndocks.\r\n\r\nEleven forty-five--and the roar of seaplanes came from above where air\r\npatrols were-guarding the skies. Small boats drove back and forth on\r\nset courses; no curious sight-seeing craft could approach the\r\n_Maryland_ that day. On board the battleship, too, there was activity\r\napparent. A bugle sounded, and the warning of bellowing Klaxons echoed\r\nacross the water. Here, in the peace and safety of the big port, the\r\ngreat man-of-war was sounding general quarters, and a scurry of\r\nrunning men showed for an instant on her decks. Anti-aircraft guns\r\nswung silently upon imaginary targets--\r\n\r\nThe watcher smiled at the absurdity of it all--this preparation to\r\nrepel the attack of a wild-eyed writer of insane threats. And yet--and\r\nyet-- He knew, too, there was apprehension in his frequent glances at\r\nhis watch.\r\n\r\nOne minute to go! Delamater should have watched the shore. And,\r\ninstead, he could not keep his eyes from the big fighting-ship\r\nsilhouetted so clearly less than a mile away, motionless and\r\nwaiting--waiting--for what? He saw the great turreted guns, useless\r\nagainst this puny, invisible opponent. Above them the fighting tops\r\nwere gleaming. And above them--\r\n\r\nDelamater shaded his eyes with a quick, tense hand: the tip of the\r\nmast was sparkling. There was a blue flash that glinted along the\r\nsteel. It was gone to reappear on the fighting top itself--then lower.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat was it? the watching man was asking himself. What did it bring to\r\nmind? A street-car? A defective trolley? The zipping flash of a\r\ncontact made and broken? That last!\r\n\r\nLike the touch of a invisible wire, tremendously charged, a wire that\r\ntouched and retreated, that made and lost its contact, the flashing\r\narc was working toward the deck. It felt its way to the body of the\r\nship; the arc was plain, starting from mid-air to hiss against the\r\narmored side; the arc shortened--went to nothing--vanished.... A puff\r\nof smoke from an open port proved its presence inside. Delamater had\r\nthe conviction that a deadly something had gone through the ship's\r\nside--was insulated from it--was searching with its blazing, arcing\r\nend for the ammunition rooms....\r\n\r\nThe realization of that creeping menace came to Delamater with a\r\ngripping, numbing horror. The seconds were almost endless as he\r\nwaited. Slowly, before his terrified eyes, the deck of the great ship\r\nbulged upward ... slowly it rolled and tore apart ... a mammoth turret\r\nwith sixteen-inch guns was lifting unhurriedly into the air ... there\r\nwere bodies of men rocketing skyward....\r\n\r\nThe mind of the man was racing at lightning speed, and the havoc\r\nbefore him seemed more horrible in its slow, leisurely progress. If he\r\ncould only move--do something!\r\n\r\nThe shock of the blasted air struck him sprawling into the bottom of\r\nthe boat; the listener was hammered almost to numbness by the\r\ndeafening thunder that battered and tore through the still air. At top\r\nspeed the helmsman drove for the shelter of a hidden cove. They made\r\nit an instant before the great waves struck high upon the sand spit.\r\nOver the bay hung a ballooning cloud of black and gray--lifting for an\r\ninstant to show in stark ghastliness the wreckage, broken and twisted,\r\nthat marked where the battleship _Maryland_ rested in the mud in the\r\nharbor of New York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the Secret-Service men were filled with the indelible\r\nimpress of what they had seen. Again and again, before him, came the\r\nvision of a ship full of men in horrible, slow disintegration; his\r\nmind was numbed and his actions and reactions were largely automatic.\r\nBut somehow he found himself in the roar of the subway, and later he\r\nsat in a chair and knew he was in a Pullman of a Washington train.\r\n\r\nHe rode for hours in preoccupied silence, his gaze fixed unseeingly,\r\nstriving to reach out and out to some distant, unknown something which\r\nhe was trying to visualize. But he looked at intervals at his hand\r\nthat held three metal pellets.\r\n\r\nHe was groping for the mental sequence which would bring the few known\r\nfacts together and indicate their cause. A threat--a seeming spying\r\nwithin a closed and secret room--the murder on the ninth floor, a\r\nmurder without trace of wound or weapon. Weapon! He stared again at\r\nthe tangible evidence he held; then shook his head in perplexed\r\nabstraction. No--the man was killed by unknown means.\r\n\r\nAnd now--the _Maryland_! And a visible finger of death--touching,\r\nflashing, feeling its way to the deadly cargo of powder sacks.\r\n\r\nNot till he sat alone with his chief did he put into words his\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n\"A time bomb did it,\" the Chief was saying. \"The officials deny it,\r\nbut what other answer is there? No one approached that ship--you know\r\nthat, Del--no torpedo nor aerial bomb! Nothing as fanciful as that!\"\r\n\r\nRobert Delamater's lips formed a wry smile. \"Nothing at fanciful as\r\nthat\"--and he was thinking, thinking--of what he hardly dared express.\r\n\r\n\"We will start with the ship's personnel,\" the other continued; \"find\r\nevery man who was not on board when the explosion occurred--\"\r\n\r\n\"No use,\" the operative interrupted; \"this was no inside job, Chief.\"\r\nHe paused to choose his words while the other watched him curiously.\r\n\r\n\"Someone _did_ reach that ship--reached it from a distance--reached it\r\nin the same way they reached that poor devil I left at room nine\r\nforty-seven. Listen--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe told his superior of his vigil on the speed-boat--of the almost\r\ninvisible flash against the ship's mast. \"He reached it, Chief,\" he\r\nconcluded; \"he felt or saw his way down and through the side of that\r\nship. And he fired their ammunition from God knows where.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said the big man slowly; \"I wonder if you know just what\r\nyou are trying to tell me--just how absurd your idea is. Are you\r\nseriously hinting at long-distance vision through solid\r\narmor-plate--through these walls of stone and steel? And wireless\r\npower-transmission through the same wall--!\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\" said the operative.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Del, you must be as crazy as this Eye of Allah individual. It's\r\nimpossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"That word,\" said Delamater, quietly, \"has been crossed out of\r\nscientific books in the past few years.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have studied some physical science, of course?\" Delamater asked.\r\nThe Chief nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Then you know what I mean. I mean that up to recent years science had\r\nall the possibilities and impossibilities neatly divided and\r\ncatalogued. Ignorance, as always, was the best basis for positive\r\nassurance. Then they got inside the atom. And since then your real\r\nscientist has been a very humble man. He has seen the impossibility of\r\nyesterday become the established fact of to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the United States Secret Service was tapping with nervous\r\nirritation on the desk before him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!\" he agreed, and again he looked oddly at his operative.\r\n\"Perhaps there is something to that; you work along that line, Del:\r\nyou can have a free hand. Take a few days off, a little vacation if\r\nyou wish. Yes--and ask Sprague to step in from the other office; he\r\nhas the personnel list.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRobert Delamater felt the other's eyes follow him as he left the room.\r\n\"And that about lets me out,\" he told himself; \"he thinks I've gone\r\ncuckoo, now.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped in a corridor; his fingers, fumbling in a vest pocket, had\r\ntouched the little metal spheres. Again his mind flashed back to the\r\nchain of events he had linked together. He turned toward an inner\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to see Doctor Brooks,\" he said. And when the physician\r\nappeared: \"About that man who was murdered at the hotel, Doctor--\"\r\n\r\n\"Who died,\" the doctor corrected; \"we found no evidence of murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was murdered,\" the operative insisted. \"Have you his clothing\r\nwhere I can examine it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" agreed the physician. He led Delamater to another room and\r\nbrought out a box of the dead man's effects.\r\n\r\n\"But if it's murder you expect to prove you'll find no help in this.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service man nodded. \"I'll look them over, just the same,\"\r\nhe said. \"Thanks.\"\r\n\r\nAlone in the room, he went over the clothing piece by piece. Again he\r\nexamined each garment, each pocket, the lining, as he had done before\r\nwhen first he took the case. Metal, he thought, he must find metal.\r\n\r\nBut only when a heavy shoe was in his hands did the anxious frown\r\nrelax from about his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he whispered, half aloud. \"What a fool I was! I should\r\nhave thought of that.\"\r\n\r\nThe soles of the shoes were sewed, but, beside the stitches were metal\r\nspecks, where cobbler's nails were driven. And in the sole of one shoe\r\nwere three tiny holes.\r\n\r\n\"Melted!\" he said exultantly. \"Crazy, am I, Chief? This man was\r\nstanding on a wet floor; he made a perfect ground. And he got a jolt\r\nthat melted these nails when it flashed out of him.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrapped the clothing carefully and replaced it in the box. And he\r\nfingered the metal pellets in his pocket as he slipped quietly from\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe did not stop to talk with Doctor Brooks; he wanted to think, to\r\nponder upon the incredible proof of the theory he had hardly dared\r\nbelieve. The Eye of Allah--the maniac--was real; and his power for\r\nevil! There was work to be done, and the point of beginning was not\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nHow far did the invisible arm reach? How far could the Eye of Allah\r\nsee? Where was the generator--the origin of this wireless power; along\r\nwhat channel did it flow? A ray of lightless light--an unseen ethereal\r\nvibration.... Delamater could only guess at the answers.\r\n\r\nThe current to kill a man or to flash a spark into silken powder bags\r\nneed not be heavy, he knew. Five hundred--a thousand volts--if the\r\nmysterious conductor carried it without resistance and without loss.\r\nPeople had been killed by house-lighting currents--a mere 110\r\nvolts--when conditions were right. There would be no peculiar or\r\nunusual demand upon the power company to point him toward the hidden\r\nmaniac.\r\n\r\nHe tossed restlessly throughout the night, and morning brought no\r\nanswer to his repeated questions. But it brought a hurry call from his\r\nChief.\r\n\r\n\"Right away,\" was the instruction; \"don't lose a minute. Come to the\r\noffice.\"\r\n\r\nHe found the big man at his desk. He was quiet, unhurried, but the\r\noperative knew at a glance the tense repression that was being\r\nexercised--the iron control of nerves that demanded action and found\r\nincompetence and helplessness instead.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe your fantastic theories,\" he told Delamater.\r\n\"Impractical--impossible! But--\" He handed the waiting man a paper.\r\n\"We must not leave a stone unturned.\"\r\n\r\nDelamater said nothing; he looked at the paper in his hand. \"To the\r\nPresident of the United States,\" he read. \"Prepare to meet your God.\r\nFriday. The eighth. Twelve o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nThe signature he hardly saw; the staring, open eye was all too\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\n\"That is to-morrow,\" said Delamater softly. \"The President dies\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"No!\" exploded the Chief. \"Do you realize what that means? The\r\nPresident murdered--more killings to follow--and the killer unknown!\r\nWhy the country will be in a panic: the whole structure of the\r\nGovernment is threatened!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, then added as he struck his open hand upon the desk: \"I\r\nwill have every available man at the White House.\"\r\n\r\n\"For witnesses?\" asked Delamater coldly.\r\n\r\nThe big man stared at his operative; the lines of his face were\r\nsagging.\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe--really--he can strike him down--at his desk--from a\r\ndistance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it.\" Delamater's fingers played for a moment with three bits\r\nof metal in his pocket. Unconsciously he voiced his thoughts: \"Does\r\nthe President have nails in his shoes, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"What--what's that?\" the Chief demanded.\r\n\r\nBut Delamater made no reply. He was picturing the President. He would\r\nbe seated at his desk, waiting, waiting ... and the bells would be\r\nringing and whistles blowing from distant shops when the bolt would\r\nstrike.... It would flash from his feet ... through the thick rug ...\r\nthrough the rug.... It would have to ground.\r\n\r\nHe paid no heed to his Chief's repeated question. He was seeing, not\r\nthe rug in the Presidential office, but below it--underneath it--a\r\nheavy pad of rubber.\r\n\r\n\"If he can be insulated--\" he said aloud, and stared unseeingly at his\r\neagerly listening superiors--\"even the telephone cut--no possible\r\nconnection with the ground--\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Del, if you've got an idea--any hope at all! I'm--I'm\r\nup against it, Del.\"\r\n\r\nThe operative brought his distant gaze back to the room and the man\r\nacross from him. \"Yes,\" he said slowly, thoughtfully, \"I've got the\r\nbeginning of an idea; I don't see the end of it yet.\r\n\r\n\"We can cut him off from the ground--the President, I mean--make an\r\ninsulated island where he sits. But this devil will get him the\r\ninstant he leaves ... unless ... unless....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--yes?\" The Chief's voice was high-pitched with anxious\r\nimpatience; for the first time he was admitting to himself his\r\ncomplete helplessness in this emergency.\r\n\r\n\"Unless,\" said Delamater, as the idea grew and took shape, \"unless\r\nthat wireless channel works both ways. If it does ... if it does....\"\r\n\r\nThe big man made a gesture of complete incomprehension.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" said Robert Delamater, sharply. If ever his sleepy indolence\r\nhad misled his Chief, there was none to do so now in the voice that\r\nrang like cold steel. His eyes were slits under the deep-drawn brows,\r\nand his mouth was one straight line.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the hunter there is no greater game than man. And Robert Delamater,\r\nman-hunter, had his treacherous quarry in sight. He fired staccato\r\nquestions at his Chief.\r\n\r\n\"Is the President at his desk at twelve?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he know--about this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he know it means death?\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief nodded.\r\n\r\n\"I see a way--a chance,\" said the operative. \"Do I get a free hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--Good Lord, yes! If there's any chance of--\"\r\n\r\nDelamater silenced him. \"I'll be the one to take the chance,\" he said\r\ngrimly. \"Chief, I intend to impersonate the President.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now listen-- The President and I are about the same build. I know a\r\nman who can take care of the make-up; he will get me by anything but a\r\nclose inspection. This Eye of Allah, up to now, has worked only in the\r\nlight. We'll have to gamble on that and work our change in the dark.\r\n\r\n\"The President must go to bed as usual--impress upon him that he may\r\nbe under constant surveillance. Then, in the night, he leaves--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know he won't want to hide himself, but he must. That's up to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\"Arrange for me to go to his room before daylight. From that minute on\r\nI am the President. Get me his routine for that morning; I must follow\r\nit so as to arouse no least suspicion.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"But I don't see--\" began the Chief. \"You will impersonate\r\nhim--yes--but what then? You will be killed if this maniac makes good.\r\nIs the President of the United States to be a fugitive? Is--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, hold on!\" said Delamater. He leaned back in his chair; his\r\nface relaxed to a smile, then a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I've got it all now. Perhaps it will work. If not--\" A shrug of the\r\nshoulders completed the thought. \"And I have been shooting it to you\r\npretty fast haven't I! Now here is the idea--\r\n\r\n\"I must be in the President's chair at noon. This Allah person will be\r\nwatching in, so I must be acting the part all morning. I will have the\r\nheaviest insulation I can get under the rug, and I'll have something\r\nto take the shot instead of myself. And perhaps, perhaps I will send a\r\nmessage back to the Eye of Allah that will be a surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a bet?\" he asked. \"Remember, I'm taking the chance--unless you\r\nknow some better way--\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief's chair came down with a bang. \"We'll gamble on it, Del,\" he\r\nsaid; \"we've got to--there is no other way.... And now what do you\r\nwant?\"\r\n\r\n\"A note to the White House electrician,\" said Robert Delamater, \"and\r\nfull authority to ask for anything I may need, from the U. S. Treasury\r\ndown to a pair of wire-cutters.\"\r\n\r\nHis smile had become contagious; the Chief's anxious look relaxed. \"If\r\nyou pull this off, Del, they may give you the Treasury or the Mint at\r\nthat. But remember, republics are notoriously ungenerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to gamble on that, too,\" said Robert Delamater.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe heart of the Nation is Washington. Some, there are, who would have\r\nus feel that New York rules our lives. Chicago--San Francisco--these\r\nand other great cities sometimes forget that they are mere ganglia on\r\nthe financial and commercial nervous system. The heart is Washington,\r\nand, Congress to the contrary notwithstanding, the heart of that heart\r\nis not the domed building at the head of Pennsylvania Avenue, but an\r\nAmerican home. A simple, gracious mansion, standing in quiet dignity\r\nand whiteness above its velvet lawns.\r\n\r\nIt is the White House that draws most strongly at the interest and\r\ncuriosity of the homely, common throng that visits the capital.\r\n\r\nBut there were no casual visitors at the White House on the seventh of\r\nSeptember. Certain Senators, even, were denied admittance. The\r\nPresident was seeing only the members of the Cabinet and some few\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIt is given to a Secret Service operative, in his time, to play many\r\nparts. But even a versatile actor might pause at impersonating a\r\nPresident. Robert Delamater was acting the role with never a fumble.\r\nHe sat, this new Robert Delamater, so startlingly like the Chief\r\nExecutive, in the chair by a flat top desk. And he worked diligently\r\nat a mass of correspondence.\r\n\r\nSecretaries came and went; files were brought. Occasionally he replied\r\nto a telephone call--or perhaps called someone. It would be hard to\r\nsay which happened, for no telephone bells rang.\r\n\r\nOn the desk was a schedule that Delamater consulted. So much time for\r\ncorrespondence--so many minutes for a conference with this or that\r\nofficial, men who were warned to play up to this new Chief Executive\r\nas if the life of their real President were at stake.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo any observer the busy routine of the morning must have passed with\r\nnever a break. And there was an observer, as Delamater knew. He had\r\nwondered if the mystic ray might carry electrons that would prove its\r\npresence. And now he knew.\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the U. S. Secret Service had come for a consultation with\r\nthe President. And whatever lingering doubts may have stifled his\r\nreluctant imagination were dispelled when the figure at the desk\r\nopened a drawer.\r\n\r\n\"Notice this,\" he told the Chief as he appeared to search for a paper\r\nin the desk. \"An electroscope; I put it in here last night. It is\r\ndischarging. The ray has been on since nine-thirty. No current to\r\nelectrocute me--just a penetrating ray.\"\r\n\r\nHe returned the paper to the drawer and closed it.\r\n\r\n\"So that is that,\" he said, and picked up a document to which he\r\ncalled the visitor's attention.\r\n\r\n\"Just acting,\" he explained. \"The audience may be critical; we must\r\ntry to give them a good show! And now give me a report. What are you\r\ndoing? Has anything else turned up? I am counting on you to stand by\r\nand see that that electrician is on his toes at twelve o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stand by is right,\" the Chief agreed; \"that's about all we can do. I\r\nhave twenty men in and about the grounds--there will be as many more\r\nlater on. And I know now just how little use we are to you, Del.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your expression!\" warned Delamater. \"Remember you are talking to the\r\nPresident. Very official and all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right! But now tell me what is the game, Del. If that devil fails to\r\nknock you out here where you are safe, he will get you when you leave\r\nthe room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" agreed the pseudo-executive, \"and again, perhaps not. He\r\nwon't get me here; I am sure of that. They have this part of the room\r\ninsulated. The phone wire is cut--my conversations there are all\r\nfaked.\r\n\r\n\"There is only one spot in this room where that current can pass. A\r\nheavy cable is grounded outside in wet earth. It comes to a copper\r\nplate on this desk; you can't see it--it is under those papers.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"And if the current comes--\" began the visitor.\r\n\r\n\"When it comes,\" the other corrected, \"it will jump to that plate and\r\ngo off harmlessly--I hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then what? How does that let you out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will see,\" said the presidential figure. \"And you've been\r\nhere long enough, Chief. Send in the President's secretary as you go\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"He arose to place a friendly, patronizing hand on the other's\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by,\" he said, \"and watch that electrician at twelve. He is to\r\nthrow the big switch when I call.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good luck,\" said the big man huskily. \"We've got to hand it to you,\r\nDel; you're--\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-by!\" The figure of the Chief Executive turned abruptly to his\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\nThere was more careful acting--another conference--some dictating. The\r\nclock on the desk gave the time as eleven fifty-five. The man before\r\nthe flat topped desk verified it by a surreptitious glance at his\r\nwatch. He dismissed the secretary and busied himself with some\r\npersonal writing.\r\n\r\nEleven fifty-nine--and he pushed paper and pen aside. The movement\r\ndisturbed some other papers, neatly stacked. They were dislodged, and\r\nwhere they had lain was a disk of dull copper.\r\n\r\n\"Ready,\" the man called softly. \"Don't stand too near that line.\" The\r\nfirst boom of noonday bells came faintly to the room.\r\n\r\nThe President--to all but the other actors in the morning's\r\ndrama--leaned far back in his chair. The room was suddenly deathly\r\nstill. The faint ticking of the desk clock was loud and rasping. There\r\nwas heavy breathing audible in the room beyond. The last noonday chime\r\nhad died away....\r\n\r\nThe man at the desk was waiting--waiting. And he thought he was\r\nprepared, nerves steeled, for the expected. But he jerked back, to\r\nfall with the overturned chair upon the soft, thick-padded rug, at the\r\nripping, crackling hiss that tore through the silent room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom a point above the desk a blue arc flamed and wavered. Its unseen\r\nterminal moved erratically in the air, but the other end of the deadly\r\nflame held steady upon a glowing, copper disc.\r\n\r\nDelamater, prone on the floor, saw the wavering point that marked the\r\nend of the invisible carrier of the current--saw it drift aside till\r\nthe blue arc was broken. It returned, and the arc crashed again into\r\nblinding flame. Then, as abruptly, the blue menace vanished.\r\n\r\nThe man on the floor waited, waited, and tried to hold fast to some\r\nsense of time.\r\n\r\nThen: \"Contact!\" he shouted. \"The switch! Close the switch!\"\r\n\r\n\"Closed!\" came the answer from a distant room. There was a shouted\r\nwarning to unseen men: \"Stand back there--back--there's twenty\r\nthousand volts on that line--\"\r\n\r\nAgain the silence....\r\n\r\n\"Would it work? Would it?\" Delamater's mind was full of delirious,\r\nhalf-thought hopes. That fiend in some far-off room had cut the\r\ncurrent meant as a death-bolt to the Nation's' head. He would leave\r\nthe ray on--look along it to gloat over his easy victory. His\r\ngenerator must be insulated: would he touch it with his hand, now that\r\nhis own current was off?--make of himself a conductor?\r\n\r\nIn the air overhead formed a terrible arc.\r\n\r\nFrom the floor, Delamater saw it rip crashingly into life as twenty\r\nthousand volts bridged the gap of a foot or less to the invisible ray.\r\nIt hissed tremendously in the stillness....\r\n\r\nAnd Delamater suddenly buried his face in his hands. For in his mind\r\nhe was seeing a rigid, searing body, and in his nostrils, acrid,\r\ndistinct, was the smell of burning flesh.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool,\" he told himself fiercely. \"Don't be a fool!\r\nImagination!\"\r\n\r\nThe light was out.\r\n\r\n\"Switch off!\" a voice was calling. There was a rush of swift feet from\r\nthe distant doors; friendly hands were under him--lifting him--as the\r\nroom, for Robert Delamater, President-in-name of the United States,\r\nturned whirlingly, dizzily black....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRobert Delamater, U. S. Secret Service operative, entered the office\r\nof his Chief. Two days of enforced idleness and quiet had been all he\r\ncould stand. He laid a folded newspaper before the smiling, welcoming\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"That's it, I suppose,\" he said, and pointed to a short notice.\r\n\r\n\"X-ray Operator Killed,\" was the caption. \"Found Dead in Office in\r\nWatts Building.\" He had read the brief item many times.\r\n\r\n\"That's what we let the reporters have,\" said the Chief.\r\n\r\n\"Was he\"--the operative hesitated for a moment--\"pretty well fried?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the machine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Broken glass and melted metal. He smashed it as he fell.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Eye of Allah,\" mused Delamater. \"Poor devil--poor, crazy devil.\r\nWell, we gambled--and we won. How about the rest of the bet? Do I get\r\nthe Mint?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell, no!\" said the Chief. \"Do you expect to win all the time? They\r\nwant to know why it took us so long to get him.\r\n\r\n\"Now, there's a little matter out in Ohio, Del, that we'll have to get\r\nafter--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"TELELUX\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSound and light were transformed into mechanical action at the banquet\r\nof the National Tool Exposition recently to illustrate their\r\npossibilities in regulating traffic, aiding the aviator, and\r\nperforming other automatic functions.\r\n\r\nA beam of light was thrown on the \"eyes\" of a mechanical contrivance\r\nknown as the \"telelux,\" a brother of the \"televox,\" and as the light\r\nwas thrown on and off it performed mechanical function such as turning\r\nan electric switch.\r\n\r\nThe contrivance, which was developed by the Westinghouse Electric and\r\nManufacturing Company, utilizes two photo-electric cells, sensitive to\r\nthe light beam. One of the cells is a selector, which progressively\r\nchooses any one of three operating circuits when light is thrown on\r\nit. The other cell is the operator, which opens or closes the chosen\r\ncircuit, thus performing the desired function.\r\n\r\nS. M.

One might commence when\r\nProfessor Denham, Ph. D., M. A., etc., isolated a metal that\r\nscientists have been talking about for many years without ever being\r\nable to smelt. Or it might start with his first experimental use of\r\nthat metal with entirely impossible results. Or it might very\r\nplausibly begin with an interview between a celebrated leader of\r\ngangsters in the city of Chicago and a spectacled young laboratory\r\nassistant, who had turned over to him a peculiar heavy object of solid\r\ngold and very nervously explained, and finally managed to prove, where\r\nit came from. With also impossible results, because it turned \"King\"\r\nJacaro, lord of vice-resorts and rum-runners, into a passionate\r\nenthusiast in non-Euclidean geometry. The whole story might be said to\r\nbegin with the moment of that interview.\r\n\r\nBut that leaves out Smithers, and especially it leaves out Tommy\r\nReames. So, on the whole, it is best to take up the narrative at the\r\nmoment of Tommy's first entrance into the course of events.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nHe came to a stop in a cloud of dust that swirled up to and all about\r\nthe big roadster, and surveyed the gate of the private road. The gate\r\nwas rather impressive. At its top was a sign. \"Keep Out!\" Halfway down\r\nwas another sign. \"Private Property. Trespassers Will Be Prosecuted.\"\r\nOn one gate-post was another notice, \"Live Wires Within.\" and on the\r\nother a defiant placard. \"Savage Dogs At Large Within This Fence.\"\r\n\r\nThe fence itself was all of seven feet high and made of the heaviest\r\nof woven-wire construction. It was topped with barbed wire, and went\r\nall the way down both sides of a narrow right of way until it vanished\r\nin the distance.\r\n\r\nTommy got out of the car and opened the gate. This fitted the\r\ndescription of his destination, as given him by a brawny, red-headed\r\nfilling-station attendant in the village some two miles back. He drove\r\nthe roadster through the gate, got out and closed it piously, got back\r\nin the car and shot it ahead.\r\n\r\nHe went humming down the narrow private road at forty-five miles an\r\nhour. That was Tommy Reames' way. He looked totally unlike the\r\nconventional description of a scientist of any sort--as much unlike a\r\nscientist as his sport roadster looked unlike a scientist's customary\r\nmeans of transit--and ordinarily he acted quite unlike one. As a\r\nmatter of fact, most of the people Tommy associated with had no\r\nfaintest inkling of his taste for science as an avocation. There was\r\nPeter Dalzell, for instance, who would have held up his hands in holy\r\nhorror at the idea of Tommy Reames being the author of that article.\r\n\"On the Mass and Inertia of the Tesseract,\" which in the\r\n_Philosophical Journal_ had caused a controversy.\r\n\r\nAnd there was one Mildred Holmes--of no importance in the matter of\r\nthe Fifth-Dimension Catapult--who would have lifted beautifully arched\r\neyebrows in bored unbelief if anybody had suggested that Tommy Reames\r\nwas that Thomas Reames whose \"Additions to Herglotz's Mechanics of\r\nContinua\" produced such diversities of opinion in scientific circles.\r\nShe intended to make Tommy propose to her some day, and thought she\r\nknew all about him. And everybody, everywhere, would have been\r\nincredulous of his present errand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGliding down the narrow, fenced-in road. Tommy was a trifle dubious\r\nabout this errand himself. A yellow telegraph-form in his pocket read\r\nrather like a hoax, but was just plausible enough to have brought him\r\naway from a rather important tennis match. The telegram read:\r\n\r\n    PROFESSOR DENHAM IN EXTREME DANGER THROUGH EXPERIMENT BASED ON\r\n    YOUR ARTICLE ON DOMINANT COORDINATES YOU ALONE CAN HELP HIM IN\r\n    THE NAME OF HUMANITY COME AT ONCE.\r\n\r\n                                                     A. VON HOLTZ.\r\n\r\nThe fence went on past the car. A mile, a mile and a half of narrow\r\nlane, fenced in and made as nearly intruder-proof as possible.\r\n\r\n\"Wonder what I'd do,\" said Tommy Reames, \"if another car came along\r\nfrom the other end?\"\r\n\r\nHe deliberately tried not to think about the telegram any more. He\r\ndidn't believe it. He couldn't believe it. But he couldn't ignore it,\r\neither. Nobody could: few scientists, and no human being with a normal\r\namount of curiosity. Because the article on dominant coordinates had\r\nappeared in the _Journal of Physics_ and had dealt with a state of\r\nthings in which the normal coordinates of everyday existence were\r\nassumed to have changed their functions: when the coordinates of time,\r\nthe vertical, the horizontal and the lateral changed places and a man\r\nwent east to go up and west to go \"down\" and ran his street-numbers in\r\na fourth dimension. It was mathematical foolery, from one standpoint,\r\nbut it led to some fascinating if abstruse conclusions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut his brain would not remain away from the subject of the telegram,\r\neven though a chicken appeared in the fenced-in lane ahead of him and\r\nwent flapping wildly on before the car. It rose in mid-air, the car\r\novertook it as it rose above the level of the hood, and there was a\r\nrolling, squawking bundle of shedding feathers tumbling over and over\r\nalong the hood until it reached the slanting windshield. There it spun\r\nwildly upward, left a cloud of feather's fluttering about Tommy's\r\nhead, and fell still squawking into the road behind. By the back-view\r\nmirror, Tommy could see it picking itself up and staggering dizzily\r\nback to the side of the road.\r\n\r\n\"My point was,\" said Tommy vexedly to himself, speaking of the article\r\nthe telegram referred to, \"that a man can only recognize three\r\ndimensions of space and one of time. So that if he got shot out of\r\nthis cosmos altogether he wouldn't know the difference. He'd still\r\nseem to be in a three-dimensioned universe. And what is there in that\r\nstuff to get Denham in trouble?\"\r\n\r\nA house appeared ahead. A low, rambling sort of bungalow with a huge\r\nbrick barn behind it. The house of Professor Denham, very certainly,\r\nand that barn was the laboratory in which he made his experiments.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, Tommy stepped on the gas. The car leaped ahead. And\r\nthen he was braking frantically. A pipe-framed gate with thinner,\r\nunpainted wire mesh filling its surface loomed before him, much too\r\nlate for him to stop. There was a minor shock, a crashing and\r\nsqueaking, and then a crash and shattering of glass. Tommy bent low as\r\nthe top bar of the gate hit his windshield. The double glass cracked\r\nand crumpled and bent, but did not fly to bits. And the car came to a\r\nhalt with its wheels intricately entangled in torn-away fence wire.\r\nThe gate had been torn from its hinges and was draped rakishly over\r\nthe roadster. A tire went flat with a loud hissing noise, and Tommy\r\nReames swore softly under his breath and got out to inspect the\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was deciding that nothing irreparable was wrong when a man came\r\nbursting out of the brick building behind the house. A tall, lean,\r\nyoungish man who waved his arms emphatically and approached shouting:\r\n\r\n\"You had no right to come in here! You must go away at once! You have\r\ndamaged property! I will tell the Professor! You must pay for the\r\ndamage! You must--\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn!\" said Tommy Reames. He had just seen that his radiator was\r\npunctured. A spout of ruddy, rusty water was pouring out on the grass.\r\n\r\nThe youngish man came up furiously. A pale young man, Tommy noticed. A\r\nyoung man with bristling, close-cropped hair and horn-rimmed\r\nspectacles before weak-looking eyes. His mouth was very full and very\r\nred, in marked contrast to the pallor of his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not see the sign upon the gate?\" he demanded angrily, in\r\ncuriously stilted English. \"Did you not see that trespassers are\r\nforbidden? You must go away at once! You will be prosecuted! You will\r\nbe imprisoned! You--\"\r\n\r\nTommy said irritably:\r\n\r\n\"Are you Von Holtz? My name is Reames. You telegraphed me.\"\r\n\r\nThe waving, lanky arms stopped in the middle of an excited gesture.\r\nThe weak-looking eyes behind the lenses widened. A pink tongue licked\r\nthe too-full, too-red lips.\r\n\r\n\"Reames? The Herr Reames?\" Von Holtz stammered. Then he said\r\nsuspiciously, \"But you are not--you cannot be the Herr Reames of the\r\narticle on dominant coordinates!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why,\" said Tommy annoyedly. \"I'm also the Herr Reames of\r\nseveral other articles, such as on the mechanics of continua and the\r\nmass and inertia of the tesseract. And I believe the current\r\n_Philosophical Journal_--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe surveyed the spouting red stream from the radiator and shrugged\r\nruefully.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd telephone the village to have somebody come out and fix\r\nmy car,\" he said shortly, \"and then tell me if this telegram is a joke\r\nor not.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled out a yellow form and offered it. He had taken an\r\ninstinctive dislike to the lean figure before him, but suppressed the\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nVon Holtz took the telegram and read it, and smoothed it out, and said\r\nagitatedly:\r\n\r\n\"But I thought the Herr Reames would be--would be a venerable\r\ngentleman! I thought--\"\r\n\r\n\"You sent that wire,\" said Tommy. \"It puzzled me just enough to make\r\nme rush out here. And I feel like a fool for having done it. What's\r\nthe matter? Is it a joke?\"\r\n\r\nVon Holtz shook his head violently, even as he bit his lips.\r\n\r\n\"No! No!\" he protested. \"The Herr Professor Denham is in the most\r\nterrible, most deadly danger! I--I have been very nearly mad, Herr\r\nReames. The Ragged Men may seize him!... I telegraphed to you. I have\r\nnot slept for four nights. I have worked! I have racked my brains! I\r\nhave gone nearly insane, trying to rescue the Herr Professor! And I--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy stared.\r\n\r\n\"Four days?\" he said. \"The thing, whatever it is, has been going on\r\nfor four days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five,\" said Von Holtz nervously. \"It was only to-day that I thought\r\nof you, Herr Reames. The Herr Professor Denham had praised your\r\narticles highly. He said that you were the only man who would be able\r\nto understand his work. Five days ago--\"\r\n\r\nTommy grunted.\r\n\r\n\"If he's been in danger for five days,\" he said skeptically, \"he's not\r\nin such a bad fix or it'd have been over. Will you phone for a\r\nrepairman? Then we'll see what it's all about.\"\r\n\r\nThe lean arms began to wave again as Von Holtz said desperately:\r\n\r\n\"But Herr Reames, it is urgent! The Herr Professor is in deadly\r\ndanger!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is marooned,\" said Von Holtz. Again he licked his lips. \"He is\r\nmarooned, Herr Reames, and you alone--\"\r\n\r\n\"Marooned?\" said Tommy more skeptically still. \"In the middle of New\r\nYork State? And I alone can help him? You sound more and more as if\r\nyou were playing a rather elaborate and not very funny practical joke.\r\nI've driven sixty miles to get here. What is the joke, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\nVon Holtz said despairingly:\r\n\r\n\"But it is true, Herr Reames! He is marooned. He has changed his\r\ncoordinates. It was an experiment. He is marooned in the fifth\r\ndimension!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was dead silence. Tommy Reames stared blankly. Then his gorge\r\nrose. He had taken an instinctive dislike to this lean young man,\r\nanyhow. So he stared at him, and grew very angry, and would\r\nundoubtedly have gotten into his car and turned it about and driven it\r\naway again if it had been in any shape to run. But it wasn't. One tire\r\nwas flat, and the last ruddy drops from the radiator were dripping\r\nslowly on the grass. So he pulled out a cigarette case and lighted a\r\ncigarette and said sardonically:\r\n\r\n\"The fifth dimension? That seems rather extreme. Most of us get along\r\nvery well with three dimensions. Four seems luxurious. Why pick on the\r\nfifth?\"\r\n\r\nVon Holtz grew pale with anger in his turn. He waved his arms,\r\nstopped, and said with stiff formality:\r\n\r\n\"If the Herr Reames will follow me into the laboratory I will show him\r\nProfessor Denham and convince him of the Herr Professor's extreme\r\ndanger.\"\r\n\r\nTommy had a sudden startling conviction that Von Holtz was in earnest.\r\nHe might be mad, but he was in earnest. And there was undoubtedly a\r\nProfessor Denham, and this was undoubtedly his home and laboratory.\r\n\r\n\"I'll look, anyway,\" said Tommy less skeptically. \"But it is rather\r\nincredible, you know!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\" said Von Holtz stiffly. \"You are right, Herr\r\nReames. It is quite impossible. But it is a fact.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and stalked toward the big brick barn behind the house.\r\nTommy went with him, wholly unbelieving and yet beginning to wonder\r\nif, just possibly, there was actually an emergency of a more normal\r\nand ghastly nature in being. Von Holtz might be a madman. He might....\r\n\r\nGruesome, grisly thoughts ran through Tommy's head. A madman dabbling\r\nin science might do incredible things, horrible things, and then\r\ndemand assistance to undo an unimaginable murder....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy was tense and alert as Von Holtz opened the door of the barnlike\r\nlaboratory. He waved the lean young man on ahead.\r\n\r\n\"After you,\" he said curtly.\r\n\r\nHe felt almost a shiver as he entered. But the interior of the\r\nlaboratory displayed no gruesome scene. It was a huge, high-ceilinged\r\nroom with a concrete floor. A monster dynamo was over in one corner,\r\ncoupled to a matter-of-fact four-cylinder crude-oil engine, to which\r\nwas also coupled by a clutch an inexplicable windlass-drum with\r\nseveral hundred feet of chain wrapped around it. There were ammeters\r\nand voltmeters on a control panel, and one of the most delicate of\r\ndynamometers on its own stand, and there were work benches and a\r\nmotor-driven lathe and a very complete equipment for the working of\r\nmetals. And there was an electric furnace, with splashes of solidified\r\nmetal on the floor beside it, and there was a miniature casting-floor,\r\nand at the farther end of the monster room there was a gigantic\r\nsolenoid which evidently had once swung upon gymbals and as evidently\r\nnow was broken, because it lay toppled askew upon its supports.\r\n\r\nThe only totally unidentifiable piece of apparatus in the place was\r\none queer contrivance at one side. It looked partly like a\r\nmachine-gun, because of a long brass barrel projecting from it. But\r\nthe brass tube came out of a bulging casing of cast aluminum and there\r\nwas no opening through which shells could be fed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVon Holz moved to that contrivance, removed a cap from the end of the\r\nbrass tube, looked carefully into the opening, and waved stiffly for\r\nTommy to look in.\r\n\r\nAgain Tommy was suspicious; watched until Von Holtz was some distance\r\naway. But the instant he put his eye to the end of the brass tube he\r\nforgot all caution, all suspicion, all his doubts. He forgot\r\neverything in his amazement.\r\n\r\nThere was a lens in the end of the brass tube. It was, in fact,\r\nnothing more or less than a telescope, apparently looking at something\r\nin a closed box. But Tommy was not able to believe that he looked at\r\nan illuminated miniature for even the fraction of a second. He looked\r\ninto the telescope, and he was seeing out-of-doors. Through the\r\naluminum casting that enclosed the end of the tube. Through the thick\r\nbrick walls of the laboratory. He was gazing upon a landscape such as\r\nshould not--such as could not--exist upon the earth.\r\n\r\nThere were monstrous, feathery tree-ferns waving languid fronds in a\r\nbreeze that came from beyond them. The telescope seemed to be pointing\r\nat a gentle slope, and those tree-ferns cut off a farther view, but\r\nthere was an impenetrable tangle of breast-high foliage between the\r\ninstrument and that slope, and halfway up the incline there rested a\r\nhuge steel globe.\r\n\r\nTommy's eyes fixed themselves upon the globe. It was man-made, of\r\ncourse. He could see where it had been bolted together. There were\r\nglassed-in windows in its sides, and there was a door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Tommy looked, that door opened partway, stopped as if someone\r\nwithin had hesitated, and then opened fully. A man came out. And Tommy\r\nsaid dazedly:\r\n\r\n\"My God!\"\r\n\r\nBecause the man was a perfectly commonplace sort of individual,\r\ndressed in a perfectly commonplace fashion, and he carried a perfectly\r\ncommonplace briar pipe in his hand. Moreover, Tommy recognized him. He\r\nhad seen pictures of him often enough, and he was Professor Edward\r\nDenham, entitled to put practically all the letters of the alphabet\r\nafter his name, the author of \"Polymerization of the Pseudo-Metallic\r\nNitrides\" and the proper owner of this building and its contents. But\r\nTommy saw him against a background of tree-ferns such as should have\r\nbeen extinct upon this earth since the Carboniferous Period, some\r\nmillions of years ago.\r\n\r\nHe was looking hungrily at his briar pipe. Presently he began to hunt\r\ncarefully about on the ground. He picked together half a handful of\r\nbrownish things which had to be dried leaves. He stuffed them into the\r\npipe, struck a match, and lighted it. He puffed away gloomily,\r\nsurrounded by wholly monstrous vegetation. A butterfly fluttered over\r\nthe top of the steel globe. Its wings were fully a yard across. It\r\nflittered lightly to a plant and seemed to wait, and abruptly a vivid\r\ncarmine blossom opened wide; wide enough to admit it.\r\n\r\nDenham watched curiously enough, smoking the rank and plainly\r\nunsatisfying dried leaves. He turned his head and spoke over his\r\nshoulder. The door opened again. Again Tommy Reames was dazed. Because\r\na girl came out of the huge steel sphere--and she was a girl of the\r\nmost modern and most normal sort. A trim sport frock, slim silken\r\nlegs, bobbed hair....\r\n\r\nTommy did not see her face until she turned, smiling, to make some\r\ncomment to Denham. Then he saw that she was breath-takingly pretty. He\r\nswore softly under his breath.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe butterfly backed clumsily out of the gigantic flower. It flew\r\nlightly away, its many-colored wings brilliant in the sunshine. And\r\nthe huge crimson blossom closed slowly.\r\n\r\nDenham watched the butterfly go away. His eyes returned to the girl\r\nwho was smiling at the flying thing, now out of the field of vision of\r\nthe telescope. And there was utter discouragement visible in every\r\nline of Denham's figure. Tommy saw the girl suddenly reach out her\r\nhand and put it on Denham's shoulder. She patted it, speaking in an\r\nevident attempt to encourage him. She smiled, and talked coaxingly,\r\nand presently Denham made a queer, arrested gesture and went heavily\r\nback into the steel globe. She followed him, though she looked wearily\r\nall about before the door closed behind her, and when Denham could not\r\nsee her face, her expression was tired and anxious indeed.\r\n\r\nTommy had forgotten Von Holtz, had forgotten the laboratory, had\r\nforgotten absolutely everything. If his original suspicions of Von\r\nHoltz had been justified, he could have been killed half a dozen times\r\nover. He was oblivious to everything but the sight before his eyes.\r\n\r\nNow he felt a touch on his shoulder and drew his head away with a\r\njerk. Von Holtz was looking down at him, very pale, with his\r\nweak-looking eyes anxious.\r\n\r\n\"They are still all right?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Tommy dazedly. \"Surely. Who is that girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the Herr Professor's daughter Evelyn,\" said Von Holtz\r\nuneasily. \"I suggest, Herr Reames, that you swing the dimensoscope\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"The--what?\" asked Tommy, still dazed by what he had seen.\r\n\r\n\"The dimensoscope. This.\" Von Holtz shifted the brass tube. The whole\r\nthing was mounted so that it could be swung in any direction. The\r\nmounting was exactly like that of a normal telescope. Tommy instantly\r\nput his eye to the eyepiece again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe saw more tree-ferns, practically the duplicates of the background\r\nbeyond the globe. Nothing moved save small, fugitive creatures among\r\ntheir fronds. He swung the telescope still farther. The landscape\r\nswept by before his eyes. The tree-fern forest drew back. He saw the\r\nbeginning of a vast and noisome morass, over which lay a thick haze as\r\nof a stream raised by the sun. He saw something move in that morass;\r\nsomething huge and horrible with a long and snake-like neck and the\r\ntiniest of heads at the end of it. But he could not see the thing\r\nclearly.\r\n\r\nHe swung the telescope yet again. And he looked over miles and miles\r\nof level, haze-blanketed marsh. Here and there were clumps of taller\r\nvegetation. Here and there were steaming, desolate pools. And three or\r\nfour times he saw monstrous objects moving about clumsily in the\r\nmarsh-land.\r\n\r\nBut then a glitter at the skyline caught his eye. He tilted the\r\ntelescope to see more clearly, and suddenly he caught his breath.\r\nThere, far away at the very horizon, was a city. It was tall and\r\ngleaming and very strange. No earthly city ever flung its towers so\r\nsplendidly high and soaring. No city ever built by man gave off the\r\nfiery gleam of gold from all its walls and pinnacles. It looked like\r\nan artist's dream, hammered out in precious metal, with its outlines\r\nsoftened by the haze of distance.\r\n\r\nAnd something was moving in the air near the city. Staring, tense,\r\nagain incredulous, Tommy Reames strained his eyes and saw that it was\r\na machine. An air-craft; a flying-machine of a type wholly unlike\r\nanything ever built upon the planet Earth. It swept steadily and\r\nswiftly toward the city, dwindling as it went. It swooped downward\r\ntoward one of the mighty spires of the city of golden gleams, and\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was with a sense of shock, of almost physical shock, that Tommy\r\ncame back to realization of his surroundings to feel Von Holtz's hand\r\nupon his shoulder and to hear the lean young man saying harshly:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Herr Reames? Are you convinced that I did not lie to you? Are\r\nyou convinced that the Herr Professor Denham is in need of help?\"\r\n\r\nTommy blinked dazedly as he looked around the laboratory again. Brick\r\nwalls, an oil-spattered crude-oil engine in one corner, a concrete\r\nfloor and an electric furnace and a casting-box....\r\n\r\n\"Why--yes....\" said Tommy dazedly. \"Yes. Of course!\" Clarity came to\r\nhis brain with a jerk. He did not understand at all, but he believed\r\nwhat he had seen. Denham and his daughter were somewhere in some other\r\ndimension, yet within range of the extraordinary device he had looked\r\nthrough. And they were in trouble. So much was evident from their\r\nposes and their manner. \"Of course,\" he repeated. \"They're--there,\r\nwherever it is, and they can't get back. They don't seem to be in any\r\nimminent danger....\"\r\n\r\nVon Holtz licked his lips.\r\n\r\n\"The Ragged Men have not found them yet,\" he said in a hushed, harsh\r\nvoice. \"Before they went in the globe we saw the Ragged Men. We\r\nwatched them. If they do find the Herr Professor and his daughter,\r\nthey will kill them very slowly, so that they will take days of\r\nscreaming agony to die. It is that that I am afraid of, Herr Reames.\r\nThe Ragged Men roam the tree-fern forests. If they find the Herr\r\nProfessor they will trace each nerve to its root of agony until he\r\ndies. And we will be able only to watch....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\"The thing is,\" said Tommy feverishly, \"that we've got to find a way\r\nto get them back. Whether it duplicates Denham's results or not. How\r\nfar away are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"A few hundred yards, perhaps,\" said Von Holtz wearily, \"or ten\r\nmillion miles. It is the same thing. They are in a place where the\r\nfifth dimension is the dominant coordinate.\"\r\n\r\nTommy was pacing up and down the laboratory. He stopped and looked\r\nthrough the eyepiece of the extraordinary vision apparatus. He tore\r\nhimself away from it again.\r\n\r\n\"How does this thing work?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\nVon Holtz began to unscrew two wing-nuts which kept the top of the\r\naluminum casting in place.\r\n\r\n\"It is the first piece of apparatus which Professor Denham made,\" he\r\nsaid precisely. \"I know the theory, but I cannot duplicate it. Every\r\ndimension is at right angles to all other dimensions, of course. The\r\nHerr Professor has a note, here--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped his unscrewing to run over a heap of papers on the\r\nwork-bench--papers over which he seemed to have been poring\r\ndesperately at the time of Tommy's arrival. He handed a sheet to\r\nTommy, who read:\r\n\r\n\"If a creature who was aware of only two dimensions made two\r\nright-angled objects and so placed them that all the angles formed by\r\nthe combination were right angles, he would contrive a figure\r\nrepresented by the corner of a box; he would discover a third\r\ndimension. Similarly, if a three-dimensioned man took three right\r\nangles and placed them so that all the angles formed were right\r\nangles, he would discover a fourth dimension. This, however, would\r\nprobably be the time dimension, and to travel in time would instantly\r\nbe fatal. But with four right angles he could discover a fifth\r\ndimension, and with five right angles he could discover a sixth....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy Reames put down the paper impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Of course\" he said brusquely. \"I know all that stuff. But up to the\r\npresent time nobody has been able to put together even three right\r\nangles, in practise.\"\r\n\r\nVon Holtz had returned to the unscrewing of the wing-nuts. He lifted\r\noff the cover of the dimensoscope.\r\n\r\n\"It is the thing the Herr Professor did not confide to me,\" he said\r\nbitterly. \"The secret. The one secret! Look in here.\"\r\n\r\nTommy looked. The objective-glass at the end of the telescope faced a\r\nmirror, which was inclined to its face at an angle of forty-five\r\ndegrees. A beam of light from the objective would be reflected to a\r\nsecond mirror, twisted in a fashion curiously askew. Then the light\r\nwould go to a third mirror....\r\n\r\nTommy looked at that third mirror, and instantly his eyes ached. He\r\nclosed them and opened them again. Again they stung horribly. It was\r\nexactly the sort of eye-strain which comes of looking through a lens\r\nwhich does not focus exactly, or through a strange pair of eyeglasses.\r\nHe could see the third mirror, but his eyes hurt the instant they\r\nlooked upon it, as if that third mirror were distorted in an\r\nimpossible fashion. He was forced to draw them away. He could see,\r\nthough, that somehow that third mirror would reflect his imaginary\r\nbeam of light into a fourth mirror of which he could see only the\r\nedge. He moved his head--and still saw only the edge of a mirror. He\r\nwas sure of what he saw, because he could look into the wavy, bluish\r\ntranslucency all glass shows upon its edge. He could even see the thin\r\nlayer of silver backing. But he could not put himself into a position\r\nin which more than the edge of that mirror was visible.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" said Tommy Reames feverishly. \"That mirror--\"\r\n\r\n\"A mirror at forty-five degrees,\" said Von Holtz precisely, \"reflects\r\nlight at a right angle. There are four mirrors, and each bends a ray\r\nof light through a right angle which is also a right angle to all the\r\nothers. The result is that the dimensoscope looks into what is a fifth\r\ndimension, into which no man ever looked before. But I cannot move\r\nother mirrors into the positions they have in this instrument. I do\r\nnot know how.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy shook his head impatiently, staring at the so-simple, yet\r\nincredible device whose theory had been mathematically proven\r\nnumberless times, but never put into practice before.\r\n\r\n\"Having made this device,\" said Von Holtz, \"the Herr Professor\r\nconstructed what he termed a catapult. It was a coil of wire, like the\r\nlarge machine there. It jerked a steel ball first vertically, then\r\nhorizontally, then laterally, then in a fourth-dimensional direction,\r\nand finally projected it violently off in a fifth-dimensional path. He\r\nmade small hollow steel balls and sent a butterfly, a small sparrow,\r\nand finally a cat into that other world. The steel balls opened of\r\nthemselves and freed those creatures. They seemed to suffer no\r\ndistress. Therefore he concluded that it would be safe for him to go,\r\nhimself. His daughter refused to permit him to go alone, and he was so\r\nsure of his safety that he allowed her to enter the globe with him.\r\nShe did. I worked the catapult which flung the globe in the fifth\r\ndimension, and his device for returning failed to operate. Hence he is\r\nmarooned.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the big catapult--\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you not see that the big catapult is broken?\" demanded Von Holtz\r\nbitterly. \"A special metal is required for the missing parts. That, I\r\nknow how to make. Yes. I can supply that. But I cannot shape it! I\r\ncannot design the gears which will move it as it should be moved! I\r\ncannot make another dimensoscope. I cannot, Herr Reames, calculate any\r\nmethod of causing four right angles to be all at right angles to each\r\nother. It is my impossibility! It is for that that I have appealed to\r\nyou. You see it has been done. I see that it is done. I can make the\r\nmetal which alone can be moved in the necessary direction. But I\r\ncannot calculate any method of moving it in that direction! If you can\r\ndo so, Herr Reames, we can perhaps save the Herr Professor Denham. If\r\nyou cannot--Gott! The death he will die is horrible to think of!\"\r\n\r\n\"And his daughter,\" said Tommy grimly. \"His daughter, also.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe paced up and down the laboratory again. Von Holtz moved to the\r\nwork-bench from which he had taken Denham's note. There was a pile of\r\nsuch memoranda, thumbed over and over. And there were papers in the\r\nangular, precise handwriting which was Von Holtz's own, and\r\ncalculations and speculations and the remains of frantic efforts to\r\nwork out, somehow, the secret which as one manifestation had placed\r\none mirror so that it hurt the eyes to look at it, and one other\r\nmirror so that from every angle of a normal existence, one could see\r\nonly the edge.\r\n\r\n\"I have worked, Herr Reames,\" said Von Holtz drearily. \"Gott! How I\r\nhave worked! But the Herr Professor kept some things secret, and that\r\nso-essential thing is one of them.\"\r\n\r\nPresently he said tiredly:\r\n\r\n\"The dimension-traveling globe was built in this laboratory. It rested\r\nhere.\" He pointed. \"The Herr Professor was laughing and excited at the\r\nmoment of departure. His daughter smiled at me through the window of\r\nthe globe. There was an under-carriage with wheels upon it. You cannot\r\nsee those wheels through the dimensoscope. They got into the globe and\r\nclosed the door. The Herr Professor nodded to me through the glass\r\nwindow. The dynamo was running at its fullest speed. The laboratory\r\nsmelled of hot oil, and of ozone from the sparks. I lifted my hand,\r\nand the Herr Professor nodded again, and I threw the switch. This\r\nswitch, Herr Reames! It sparked as I closed it, and the flash partly\r\nblinded me. But I saw the globe rush toward the giant catapult yonder.\r\nIt leaped upward into the huge coil, which whirled madly. Dazed, I saw\r\nthe globe hanging suspended in mid-air, two feet from the floor. It\r\nshook! Once! Twice! With violence! Suddenly its outline became hazy\r\nand distorted. My eyes ached with looking at it. And then it was\r\ngone!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVon Holtz's arms waved melodramatically.\r\n\r\n\"I rushed to the dimensoscope and gazed through it into the fifth\r\ndimension. I saw the globe floating onward through the air, toward\r\nthat bank of glossy ferns. I saw it settle and turn over, and then\r\nslowly right itself as it came to rest. The Herr Professor got out of\r\nit. I saw him through the instrument which could look into the\r\ndimension into which he had gone. He waved his hand to me. His\r\ndaughter joined him, surveying the strange cosmos in which they were.\r\nThe Herr Professor plucked some of the glossy ferns, took photographs,\r\nthen got back into the globe.\r\n\r\n\"I awaited its return to our own world. I saw it rock slightly as he\r\nworked upon the apparatus within. I knew that when it vanished from\r\nthe dimensoscope it would have returned to our own universe. But it\r\nremained as before. It did not move. After three hours of anguished\r\nwaiting, the Herr Professor came out and made signals to me of\r\ndespair. By gestures, because no sound could come through the\r\ndimensoscope itself, he begged me to assist him. And I was helpless!\r\nMade helpless by the Herr Professor's own secrecy! For four days and\r\nnights I have toiled, hoping desperately to discover what the Herr\r\nProfessor had hidden from me. At last I thought of you. I telegraphed\r\nto you. If you can assist me....\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to try it, of course,\" said Tommy shortly.\r\n\r\nHe paced back and forth. He stopped and looked through the brass-tubed\r\ntelescope. Giant tree-ferns, unbelievable but real. The steel globe\r\nresting partly overturned upon a bank of glossy ferns. Breast-high,\r\nincredible foliage between the point of vision and that extraordinary\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Tommy had been talking and listening, while he had been away\r\nfrom the eyepiece, one or other of the occupants of the globe had\r\nemerged from it. The door was open. But now the girl came bounding\r\nsuddenly through the ferns. She called, though it seemed to Tommy that\r\nthere was a curious air of caution even in her calling. She was\r\nexcited, hopefully excited.\r\n\r\nDenham came out of the globe with a clumsy club in his hand. But\r\nEvelyn caught his arm and pointed up into the sky. Denham stared, and\r\nthen began to make wild and desperate gestures as if trying to attract\r\nattention to himself.\r\n\r\nTommy watched for minutes, and then swung the dimensoscope around. It\r\nwas extraordinary, to be sitting in the perfectly normal brick-walled\r\nlaboratory, looking into a slender brass tube, and seeing another\r\nuniverse entirely, another wild and unbelievable landscape.\r\n\r\nThe tree-fern forest drew back and the vast and steaming morass was\r\nagain in view. There were distant bright golden gleams from the city.\r\nBut Tommy was searching the sky, looking in the sky of a world in the\r\nfifth dimension for a thing which would make a man gesticulate\r\nhopefully.\r\n\r\nHe found it. It was an aircraft, startlingly close through the\r\ntelescope. A single figure was seated at its controls, motionless as\r\nif bored, with exactly the air of a weary truck driver piloting a\r\nvehicle along a roadway he does not really see. And Tommy, being near\r\nenough to see the pilot's pose, could see the aircraft clearly. It was\r\ntotally unlike a terrestrial airplane. A single huge and thick wing\r\nsupported it. But the wing was angular and clumsy-seeming, and its\r\nform was devoid of the grace of an earthly aircraft wing, and there\r\nwas no tail whatever to give it the appearance of a living thing.\r\nThere was merely a long, rectangular wing with a framework beneath it,\r\nand a shimmering thing which was certainly not a screw propeller, but\r\nwhich seemed to draw it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt moved on steadily and swiftly, dwindling in the distance, with its\r\nmotionless pilot seated before a mass of corded bundles. It looked as\r\nif this were a freight plane of some sort, and therefore made in a\r\nstrictly utilitarian fashion.\r\n\r\nIt vanished in the haze above the monster swamp, going in a straight\r\nline for the golden city at the world's edge.\r\n\r\nTommy stared at it, long after it had ceased to be visible. Then he\r\nsaw a queer movement on the earth near the edge of the morass. Figures\r\nwere moving. Human figures. He saw four of them, shaking clenched\r\nfists and capering insanely, seeming to bellow insults after the\r\noblivious and now invisible flying thing. He could see that they were\r\nnearly naked, and that one of them carried a spear. But the\r\nindubitable glint of metal was reflected from one of them for an\r\ninstant, when some metal accoutrement about him glittered in the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nThey moved from sight behind thick, feathery foliage, and Tommy swung\r\nback the brass tube to see the globe again. Denham and his daughter\r\nwere staring in the direction in which Tommy had seen those human\r\nfigures. Denham clutched his clumsy club grimly. His face was drawn\r\nand his figure tensed. And suddenly Evelyn spoke quietly, and the two\r\nof then dived into the fern forest and disappeared. Minutes later they\r\nreturned, dragging masses of tree-fern fronds with which they masked\r\nthe globe from view. They worked hastily, desperately, concealing the\r\nsteel vehicle from sight. And then Denham stared tensely all about,\r\nshading his eyes with his hand. He and the girl withdrew cautiously\r\ninto the forest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was minutes later that Tommy was roused by Von Holtz's hand on his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened, Herr Reames?\" he asked uneasily. \"The--Ragged\r\nMen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw men,\" said Tommy briefly, \"shaking clenched fists at an\r\naircraft flying overhead. And Denham and his daughter have hidden the\r\nglobe behind a screen of foliage.\"\r\n\r\nVon Holtz licked his lips fascinatedly.\r\n\r\n\"The Ragged Men,\" he said in a hushed voice. \"The Herr Professor\r\ncalled them that, because they cannot be of the people who live in the\r\nGolden City. They hate the people of the Golden City. I think that\r\nthey are bandits; renegades, perhaps. They live in the tree-fern\r\nforests and scream curses at the airships which fly overhead. And they\r\nare afraid of those airships.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long did Denham use this thing to look through, before he built\r\nhis globe?\"\r\n\r\nVon Holtz considered.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately it worked,\" he said at last, \"he began work on a small\r\ncatapult. It took him one week to devise exactly how to make that. He\r\nexperimented with it for some days and began to make the large globe.\r\nThat took nearly two months--the globe and the large catapult\r\ntogether. And also the dimensoscope was at hand. His daughter looked\r\nthrough it more than he did, or myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"He should have known what he was up against,\" said Tommy, frowning.\r\n\"He ought to have taken guns, at least. Is he armed?\"\r\n\r\nVon Holtz shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"He expected to return at once,\" he said desperately. \"Do you see,\r\nHerr Reames, the position it puts me in? I may be suspected of murder!\r\nI am the Herr Professor's assistant. He disappears. Will I not be\r\naccused of having put him out of the way?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Tommy thoughtfully. \"You won't.\" He glanced through the\r\nbrass tube and paced up and down the room. \"You telephone for someone\r\nto repair my car,\" he said suddenly and abruptly. \"I am going to stay\r\nhere and work this thing out. I've got just the glimmering of an idea.\r\nBut I'll need my car in running order, in case we have to go out and\r\nget materials in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVon Holtz bowed stiffly and went out of the laboratory. Tommy looked\r\nafter him. Even moved to make sure he was gone. And then Tommy Reames\r\nwent quickly to the work bench on which were the littered notes and\r\ncalculations Von Holtz had been using and which were now at his\r\ndisposal. But Tommy did not leaf through them. He reached under the\r\nblotter beneath the whole pile. He had seen Von Holtz furtively push\r\nsomething out of sight, and he had disliked and distrusted Von Holtz\r\nfrom the beginning. Moreover, it was pretty thoroughly clear that\r\nDenham had not trusted him too much. A trusted assistant should be\r\nable to understand, at least, any experiment performed in a\r\nlaboratory.\r\n\r\nA folded sheet of paper came out. Tommy glanced at it.\r\n\r\n    \"You messed things up right! Denham marooned and you got\r\n    nothing. No plans or figures either. When you get them, you\r\n    get your money. If you don't you are out of luck. If this\r\n    Reames guy can't fix up what you want it'll be just too bad\r\n    for you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no salutation nor any signature beyond a scrawled and\r\nsprawling \"J.\"\r\n\r\nTommy Reames' jaw set grimly. He folded the scrap of paper and thrust\r\nit back out of sight again.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty!\" he said harshly. \"So a gentleman named 'J' is going to pay\r\nVon Holtz for plans or calculations it is hoped I'll provide! Which\r\nsuggests--many things! But at least I'll have Von Holtz's help until\r\nhe thinks my plans or calculations are complete. So that's all\r\nright....\"\r\n\r\nTommy could not be expected, of course, to guess that the note he had\r\nread was quite astounding proof of the interest taken in non-Euclidean\r\ngeometry by a vice king of Chicago, or that the ranking beer baron of\r\nthat metropolis was the man who was so absorbed in abstruse theoretic\r\nphysics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy moved toward the great solenoid which lay askew upon its wrecked\r\nsupport. It had drawn the steel globe toward it, had made that globe\r\nvibrate madly, twice, and then go hazy and vanish. It had jerked the\r\nglobe in each of five directions, each at right angles to all the\r\nothers, and had released it when started in the fifth dimension. The\r\nhuge coil was quite nine feet across and would take the steel globe\r\neasily. It was pivoted in concentric rings which made up a set of\r\ngymbals far more elaborate than were ever used to suspend a mariner's\r\ncompass aboard ship.\r\n\r\nThere were three rings, one inside the other. And two rings will take\r\ncare of any motion in three dimensions. These rings were pivoted, too,\r\nso that an unbelievably intricate series of motions could be given to\r\nthe solenoid within them all. But the device was broken, now. A pivot\r\nhad given away, and shaft and socket alike had vanished. Tommy became\r\nabsorbed. Some oddity bothered him....\r\n\r\nHe pieced the thing together mentally. And he exclaimed suddenly.\r\nThere had been four rings of metal! One was gone! He comprehended,\r\nvery suddenly. The third mirror in the dimensoscope was the one so\r\nstrangely distorted by its position, which was at half of a right\r\nangle to all the dimensions of human experience. It was the third ring\r\nin the solenoid's supports which had vanished. And Tommy, staring at\r\nthe gigantic apparatus and summoning all his theoretic knowledge and\r\nall his brain to work, saw the connection between the two things.\r\n\r\n\"The time dimension and the world-line,\" he said sharply, excited in\r\nspite of himself. \"Revolving in the time dimension means telescoping\r\nin the world-line.... It would be a strain no matter could endure....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mirror in the dimensoscope was not pointing in a fourth dimension.\r\nIt did not need to. It was reflecting light at a right angle, and\r\nhence needed to be only at half of a right angle to the two courses of\r\nthe beam it reflected. But to whirl the steel globe into a fifth\r\ndimension, the solenoid's support had for one instant to revolve in\r\ntime! For the fraction of a second it would have literally to pass\r\nthrough its own substance. It would be required to undergo precisely\r\nthe sort of strain involved in turning a hollow seamless metal globe,\r\ninside out! No metal could stand such a strain. No form of matter\r\nknown to man could endure it.\r\n\r\n\"It would explode!\" said Tommy excitedly to himself, alone in the\r\ngreat bare laboratory. \"Steel itself would vaporize! It would wreck\r\nthe place!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he looked blank. Because the place had very obviously not\r\nbeen wrecked. And yet a metal ring had vanished, leaving no trace....\r\n\r\nVon Holtz came back. He looked frightened.\r\n\r\n\"A--a repairman, Herr Reames,\" he said, stammering, \"is on the way.\r\nAnd--Herr Reames....\"\r\n\r\nTommy barely heard him. For a moment, Tommy was all scientist,\r\nconfronted with the inexplicable, yet groping with a blind certainty\r\ntoward a conclusion he very vaguely foresaw. He waved his hand\r\nimpatiently....\r\n\r\n\"The Herr Jacaro is on the way here,\" stammered Von Holtz.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy blinked, remembering that Von Holtz had told him he could make a\r\ncertain metal, the only metal which could be moved in the fourth\r\ndimension.\r\n\r\n\"Jacaro?\" he said blankly.\r\n\r\n\"The--friend of the Herr Professor Denham. He advanced the money for\r\nthe Herr Professor's experiments.\"\r\n\r\nTommy heard him with only half his brain, though that half instantly\r\ndecided that Von Holtz was lying. The only Jacaro Tommy knew of was a\r\nprominent gangster from Chicago, who had recently cemented his\r\nposition in Chicago's underworld by engineering the amalgamation of\r\ntwo once-rival gangs. Tommy knew, in a vague fashion, that Von Holtz\r\nwas frightened. That he was terrified in some way. And that he was\r\ninordinately suspicious of someone, and filled with a queer\r\ndesperation.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said Tommy abstractedly. The thought he needed was coming. A\r\nmetal which would have full tensile strength up to a certain instant,\r\nand then disrupt itself without violence into a gas, a vapor.... It\r\nwould be an alloy, perhaps. It would be....\r\n\r\nHe struck at his own head with his clenched fist, angrily demanding\r\nthat his brain bring forth the thought that was forming slowly. The\r\nmetal that could be revolved in time without producing a disastrous\r\nexplosion and without requiring an impossible amount of power....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe did not see Von Holtz looking in the eyepiece of the dimensoscope.\r\nHe stared at nothing, thinking concentratedly, putting every bit of\r\nenergy into sheer thought. And suddenly, like the explosion he sought\r\na way to avoid, the answer came, blindingly clear.\r\n\r\nHe surveyed that answer warily. A tremendous excitement filled him.\r\n\r\n\"I've got it!\" he said softly to himself. \"By God, I know how he did\r\nthe thing!\"\r\n\r\nAnd as if through a mist the figure of Von Holtz became clear before\r\nhis eyes. Von Holtz was looking into the dimensoscope tube. He was\r\nstaring into that other, extraordinary world in which Denham and his\r\ndaughter were marooned. And Von Holtz's face was utterly, deathly\r\nwhite, and he was making frantic, repressed gestures, and whispering\r\nlittle whimpering phrases to himself. They were unintelligible, but\r\nthe deathly pallor of his cheeks, and the fascinated, dribbling\r\nfullness of his lips brought Tommy Reames suddenly down to earth.\r\n\r\n\"What's happening?\" demanded Tommy sharply.\r\n\r\nVon Holtz did not answer. He made disjointed, moaning little\r\nexclamations to himself. He was twitching horribly as he looked\r\nthrough the telescope into that other world....\r\n\r\nTommy flung him aside and clapped his own eye to the eyepiece. And\r\nthen he groaned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe telescope was pointed at the steel globe upon that ferny bank, no\r\nmore than a few hundred yards away but two dimensions removed from\r\nEarth. The screening mass of tree-fronds had been torn away. A swarm\r\nof ragged, half-naked men was gathered about the globe. They were\r\narmed with spears and clubs, in the main, but there were other weapons\r\nof intricate design whose uses Tommy could not even guess at. He did\r\nnot try. He was watching the men as they swarmed about and over the\r\nsteel sphere. Their faces were brutal and savage, and now they were\r\ndistorted with an insane hate. It was the same awful, gibbering hatred\r\nhe had sensed in the caperings of the four he had seen bellowing\r\nvituperation at an airplane.\r\n\r\nThey were not savages. Somehow he could not envision them as\r\nprimitive. Their features were hard-bitten, seamed with hatred and\r\nwith vice unspeakable. And they were white. The instant impression any\r\nman would have received was that here were broken men; fugitives,\r\nbandits, assassins. Here were renegades or worse from some higher,\r\ncivilized race.\r\n\r\nThey battered hysterically upon the steel globe. It was not the attack\r\nof savages upon a strange thing. It was the assault of desperate,\r\nbroken men upon a thing they hated. A glass pane splintered and\r\ncrashed. Spears were thrust into the opening, while mouths opened as\r\nif in screams of insane fury. And then, suddenly, the door of the\r\nglobe flew wide.\r\n\r\nThe Ragged Men did not wait for anyone to come out. They fought each\r\nother to get into the opening, their eyes glaring madly, filled with\r\nthe lust to kill.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA battered and antiquated flivver came chugging down the wire-fenced\r\nlane to the laboratory, an hour later. It made a prodigious din, and\r\nTommy Reames went out to meet it. He was still a little pale. He had\r\nwatched the steel globe turned practically inside out by the Ragged\r\nMen. He had seen them bringing out cameras, cushions, and even the\r\npadding of the walls, to be torn to bits in a truly maniacal fury. But\r\nhe had not seen one sign of a human being killed. Denham and his\r\ndaughter had not been in the globe when it was found and ransacked. So\r\nfar, then, they were probably safe. Tommy had seen them vanish into\r\nthe tree-fern forest. They had been afraid, and with good reason. What\r\ndangers they might encounter in the fern forest he could not guess.\r\nHow long they would escape the search of the Ragged Men, he could not\r\nknow. How he could ever hope to find them if he succeeded in\r\nduplicating Denham's dimension-traveling apparatus he could not even\r\nthink of, just now. But the Ragged Men were not searching the fern\r\nforest. So much was sure. They were encamped by the steel sphere, and\r\na scurvy-looking lot they were.\r\n\r\nComing out of the brick laboratory, Tommy saw a brawny figure getting\r\nout of the antiquated flivver whose arrival had been so thunderous.\r\nThat brawny figure nodded to him and grinned. Tommy recognized him.\r\nThe red-headed, broad-shouldered filling station attendant in the last\r\nvillage, who had given him specific directions for reaching this\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"You hit that gate a lick, didn't you?\" asked the erstwhile filling\r\nstation attendant amiably. \"Mr. Von Holtz said you had a flat and a\r\nbusted radiator. That right?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy nodded. The red-headed man walked around the car, scratched his\r\nchin, and drew out certain assorted tools. He put them on the grass\r\nwith great precision, pumped a gasoline blow-torch to pressure and\r\ntouched a match to its priming-basin, and while the gasoline flamed\r\nsmokily he made a half dozen casual movements with a file, and the\r\nbroken radiator tube was exposed for repair.\r\n\r\nHe went back to the torch and observed placidly:\r\n\r\n\"The Professor ain't around, is he?\"\r\n\r\nTommy shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Thought not,\" said the red-headed one. \"He gen'rally comes out and\r\ntalks a while. I helped him build some of them dinkuses in the barn\r\nyonder.\"\r\n\r\nTommy said eagerly:\r\n\r\n\"Say, which of those things did you help him build? That big thing\r\nwith the solenoid--the coil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. How'd it work?\" The red-headed one set a soldering iron in\r\nplace and began to jack up the rear wheel to get at the tire. \"Crazy\r\nidea, if you ask me. I told Miss Evelyn so. She laughed and said she'd\r\nbe in the ball when it was tried. Did it work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Too damn well,\" said Tommy briefly. \"I've got to repair that\r\nsolenoid. How about a job helping?\"\r\n\r\nThe red-headed man unfastened the lugs of the rim, kicked the tire\r\nspeculatively, and said, \"Gone to hell.\" He put on the spare tire with\r\nease and dispatch.\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" he said. \"How about that Mr. Von Holtz? Is he goin' to boss the\r\njob?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not,\" said Tommy, with a shade of grimness in his tone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe red-headed man nodded and took the soldering iron in hand. He\r\nunwound a strip of wire solder, mended the radiator tube with placid\r\nease, and seemed to bang the cooling-flanges with a total lack of\r\ncare. They went magically back into place, and it took close\r\ninspection to see that the radiator had been damaged.\r\n\r\n\"She's all right,\" he observed. He regarded Tommy impersonally.\r\n\"Suppose you tell me how come you horn in on this,\" he suggested, \"an'\r\nmaybe I'll play. That guy Von Holtz is a crook, if you ask me about\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nTommy ran his hand across his forehead, and told him.\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" said the red-headed man calmly. \"I think I'll go break Mr. Von\r\nHoltz's neck. I got me a hunch.\"\r\n\r\nHe took two deliberate steps forward. But Tommy said:\r\n\r\n\"I saw Denham not an hour ago. So far, he's all right. How long he'll\r\nbe all right is a question. But I'm going after him.\"\r\n\r\nThe red-headed man scrutinized him exhaustively.\r\n\r\n\"Um. I might try that myself. I kinda like the Professor. An' Miss\r\nEvelyn. My name's Smithers. Let's go look through the dinkus the\r\nProfessor made.\"\r\n\r\nThey went together into the laboratory. Von Holtz was looking through\r\nthe dimensoscope. He started back as they entered, and looked acutely\r\nuneasy when he saw the red-headed man.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do,\" he said nervously. \"They--the Ragged Men--have just\r\nbrought in a dead man. But it is not the Herr Professor.\"\r\n\r\nWithout a word, Tommy took the brass tube in his hand. Von Holtz moved\r\naway, biting his lips. Tommy stared into that strange other world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe steel sphere lay as before, slightly askew upon a bank of glossy\r\nferns. But its glass windows were shattered, and fragments of\r\neverything it had contained were scattered about. The Ragged Men had\r\nmade a camp and built a fire. Some of them were roasting meat--the\r\nhuge limb of a monstrous animal with a scaly, reptilian hide. Others\r\nwere engaged in vehement argument over the body of one of their\r\nnumber, lying sprawled out upon the ground.\r\n\r\nTommy spoke without moving his eyes from the eyepiece.\r\n\r\n\"I saw Denham with a club just now. This man was killed by a club.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ragged Men in the other world debated acrimoniously. One of them\r\npointed to the dead man's belt, and spread out his hands. Something\r\nwas missing from the body. Tommy saw, now, three or four other men\r\nwith objects that looked rather like policemen's truncheons, save that\r\nthey were made of glittering metal. They were plainly weapons. Denham,\r\nthen, was armed--if he could understand how the weapon was used.\r\n\r\nThe Ragged Men debated, and presently their dispute attracted the\r\nattention of a man with a huge black beard. He rose from where he sat\r\ngnawing at a piece of meat and moved grandly toward the disputatious\r\ngroup. They parted at his approach, but a single member continued the\r\ndebate against even the bearded giant. The bearded one plucked the\r\nglittering truncheon from his belt. The disputatious one gasped in\r\nfear and flung himself desperately forward. But the bearded man kept\r\nthe truncheon pointed steadily.... The man who assailed him staggered,\r\nreached close enough to strike a single blow, and collapsed. The\r\nbearded man pointed the metal truncheon at him as he lay upon the\r\nground. He heaved convulsively, and was still.\r\n\r\nThe bearded man went back to his seat and picked up the gnawed bit of\r\nmeat again. The dispute had ceased. The chattering group of men\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy was about to leave the eyepiece of the instrument when a\r\nmovement nearby caught his eye. A head peered cautiously toward the\r\nencampment. A second rose beside it. Denham and his daughter Evelyn.\r\nThey were apparently no more than thirty feet from the dimensoscope.\r\nTommy could see them talking cautiously, saw Denham lift and examine a\r\nmetal truncheon like the bearded man's, and force his daughter to\r\naccept it. He clutched a club, himself, with a grim satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMoments later they vanished quietly in the thick fern foliage, and\r\nthough Tommy swung the dimensoscope around in every direction, he\r\ncould see nothing of their retreat.\r\n\r\nHe rose from that instrument with something approaching hopefulness.\r\nHe'd seen Evelyn very near and very closely. She did not look happy,\r\nbut she did look alert rather than worn. And Denham was displaying a\r\nform of competence in the face of danger which was really more than\r\nwould have been expected in a Ph.D., a M.A., and other academic\r\ndistinctions running to most of the letters of the alphabet.\r\n\r\n\"I've just seen Denham and Evelyn again,\" said Tommy crisply. \"They're\r\nsafe so far. And I've seen one of the weapons of the Ragged Men in\r\nuse. If we can get a couple of automatics and some cartridges to\r\nDenham, he'll be safe until we can repair the big solenoid.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was the small catapult,\" said Von Holtz bitterly, \"but it was\r\ndismantled. The Herr Professor saw me examining it, and he dismantled\r\nit. So that I did not learn how to calculate the way of changing the\r\nposition--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy's eyes rested queerly on Von Holtz for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"You know how to make the metal required,\" he said suddenly. \"You'd\r\nbetter get busy making it. Plenty of it. We'll need it.\"\r\n\r\nVon Holtz stared at him, his weak eyes almost frightened.\r\n\r\n\"You _know_? You know how to combine the right angles?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" said Tommy. \"I've got to find out if I'm right. Will you\r\nmake the metal?\"\r\n\r\nVon Holtz bit at his too-red lips.\r\n\r\n\"But Herr Reames!\" he said stridently, \"I wish to know the equation!\r\nTell me the method of pointing a body in a fourth or a fifth\r\ndirection. It is only fair--\"\r\n\r\n\"Denham didn't tell you,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\nVon Holtz's arms jerked wildly.\r\n\r\n\"But I will not make the metal! I insist upon being told the equation!\r\nI insist upon it! I will not make the metal if you do not tell me!\"\r\n\r\nSmithers was in the laboratory, of course. He had been surveying the\r\nbig solenoid-catapult and scratching his chin reflectively. Now he\r\nturned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut Tommy took Von Holtz by the shoulders. And Tommy's hands were the\r\nfirm and sinewy hands of a sportsman, if his brain did happen to be\r\nthe brain of a scientist. Von Holtz writhed in his grip.\r\n\r\n\"There is only one substance which could be the metal I need, Von Holtz,\"\r\nhe said gently. \"Only one substance is nearly three-dimensional.\r\nMetallic ammonium! It's known to exist, because it makes a mercury\r\namalgam, but nobody has been able to isolate it because nobody has\r\nbeen able to give it a fourth dimension--duration in time. Denham did\r\nit. You can do it. And I need it, and you'd better set to work at the\r\njob. You'll be very sorry if you don't, Von Holtz!\"\r\n\r\nSmithers said with a vast calmness.\r\n\r\n\"I got me a hunch. So if y'want his neck broke....\"\r\n\r\nTommy released Von Holtz and the lean young man gasped and sputtered\r\nand gesticulated wildly in a frenzy of rage.\r\n\r\n\"He'll make it,\" said Tommy coldly. \"Because he doesn't dare not to!\"\r\n\r\nVon Holtz went out of the laboratory, his weak-looking eyes staring\r\nand wild, and his mouth working.\r\n\r\n\"He'll be back,\" said Tommy briefly. \"You've got to make a small model\r\nof that big catapult, Smithers. Can you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" said Smithers. \"The ring'll be copper tubing, with\r\npin-bearings. Wind a coil on the lathe. It'll be kinda rough, but\r\nit'll do. But gears, now....\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll attend to them. You know how to work that metallic ammonium?\"\r\n\r\n\"If that's what it was,\" agreed Smithers. \"I worked it for the\r\nProfessor.\"\r\n\r\nTommy leaned close and whispered:\r\n\r\n\"You never made any gears of that. But did you make some springs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-huh!\"\r\n\r\nTommy grinned joyously.\r\n\r\n\"Then we're set and I'm right! Von Holtz wants a mathematical formula,\r\nand no one on earth could write one, but we don't need it!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSmithers rummaged around the laboratory with a casual air, acquired\r\nthis and that and the other thing, and set to work with an astounding\r\nabsence of waste motions. From time to time he inspected the great\r\ncatapult thoughtfully, verified some impression, and went about the\r\nconstruction of another part.\r\n\r\nAnd when Von Holtz did not return, Tommy hunted for him. He suddenly\r\nremembered hearing his car motor start. He found his car missing. He\r\nswore, then, and grimly began to hunt for a telephone in the house.\r\nBut before he had raised central he heard the deep-toned purring of\r\nthe motor again. His car was coming swiftly back to the house. And he\r\nsaw, through a window, that Von Holtz was driving it.\r\n\r\nThe lean young man got out of it, his face white with passion. He\r\nstarted for the laboratory. Tommy intercepted him.\r\n\r\n\"I--went to get materials for making the metal,\" said Von Holtz\r\nhoarsely, repressing his rage with a great effort. \"I shall begin at\r\nonce, Herr Reames.\"\r\n\r\nTommy said nothing whatever. Von Holtz was lying. Of course. He\r\ncarried nothing in the way of materials. But he had gone away from the\r\nhouse, and Tommy knew as definitely as if Von Holtz had told him, that\r\nVon Holtz had gone off to communicate in safety with someone who\r\nsigned his correspondence with a J.\r\n\r\nVon Holtz went into the laboratory. The four-cylinder motor began to\r\nthrob at once. The whine of the dynamo arose almost immediately after.\r\nVon Holtz came out of the laboratory and dived into a shed that\r\nadjoined the brick building. He remained in there.\r\n\r\nTommy looked at the trip register on his speedometer. Like most people\r\nwith methodical minds, he had noted the reading on arriving at a new\r\ndestination. Now he knew how far Von Holtz had gone. He had been to\r\nthe village and back.\r\n\r\n\"Meaning,\" said Tommy grimly to himself, \"that the J who wants plans\r\nand calculations is either in the village or at the end of a\r\nlong-distance wire. And Von Holtz said he was on the way. He'll\r\nprobably turn up and try to bribe me.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe went back into the laboratory and put his eye to the eyepiece of\r\nthe dimensoscope. Smithers had his blow-torch going and was busily\r\naccumulating an apparently unrelated series of discordant bits of\r\nqueerly-shaped metal. Tommy looked through at the strange mad world he\r\ncould see through the eyepiece.\r\n\r\nThe tree-fern forest was still. The encampment of the Ragged Men was\r\nnearly quiet. Sunset seemed to be approaching in this other world,\r\nthough it was still bright outside the laboratory. The hours of day\r\nand night were obviously not the same in the two worlds, so close\r\ntogether that a man could be flung from one to the other by a\r\nmechanical contrivance.\r\n\r\nThe sun seemed larger, too, than the orb which lights our normal\r\nearth. When Tommy swung the vision instrument about to search for it,\r\nhe found a great red ball quite four times the diameter of our own\r\nsun, neatly bisected by the horizon. Tommy watched, waiting for it to\r\nsink. But it did not sink straight downward as the sun seems to do in\r\nall temperate latitudes. It descended, yes, but it moved along the\r\nhorizon as it sank. Instead of a direct and forthright dip downward,\r\nthe sun seemed to progress along the horizon, dipping more deeply as\r\nit swam. And Tommy watched it blankly.\r\n\r\n\"It's not our sun.... But it's not our world. Yet it revolves, and\r\nthere are men on it. And a sun that size would bake the earth.... And\r\nit's sinking at an angle that would only come at a latitude of--\"\r\n\r\nThat was the clue. He understood at once. The instrument through which\r\nhe regarded the strange world looked out upon the polar regions of\r\nthat world. Here, where the sun descended slantwise, were the high\r\nlatitudes, the coldest spaces upon all the whole planet. And if here\r\nthere were the gigantic growths of a carboniferous era, the tropic\r\nregions of this planet must be literal infernos.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw in its gradual descent the monster sun was going along\r\nbehind the golden city, and the outlines of its buildings, the\r\nmagnificence of its spires, were limned clearly for him against the\r\ndully glowing disk.\r\n\r\nNowhere upon earth had such a city ever been dreamed of. No man had\r\never envisioned such a place, where far-flung arches interconnected\r\nsoaring, towering columns, where curves of perfect grace were united\r\nin forms of utterly perfect proportion....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sunlight died, and dusk began and deepened, and vividly brilliant\r\nstars began to come out overhead, and Tommy suddenly searched the\r\nheavens eagerly for familiar constellations. And found not one. All\r\nthe stars were strange. These stars seemed larger and much more near\r\nthan the tiny pinpoints that blink down upon our earth.\r\n\r\nAnd then he swung the instrument again and saw great fires roaring and\r\nthe Ragged Men crouched about them. Within them, rather, because they\r\nhad built fires about themselves as if to make a wall of flame. And\r\nonce Tommy saw twin, monstrous eyes, gazing from the blackness of the\r\ntree-fern forest. They were huge eyes, and they were far apart, so\r\nthat the head of the creature who used them must have been enormous.\r\nAnd they were all of fifteen feet above the ground when they\r\nspeculatively looked over the ring of fires and the ragged, degraded\r\nmen within them. Then that creature, whatever it was, turned away and\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nBut Tommy felt a curious shivering horror of the thing. It had moved\r\nsoundlessly, without a doubt, because not one of the Ragged Men had\r\nnoted its presence. It had been kept away by the fires. But Denham and\r\nEvelyn were somewhere in the tree-fern forest, and they would not dare\r\nto make fires....\r\n\r\nTommy drew away from the dimensoscope, shivering. He had been looking\r\nonly, but the place into which he looked was real, and the dangers\r\nthat lay hidden there were very genuine, and there was a man and a\r\ngirl of his own race and time struggling desperately, without arms or\r\nhope, to survive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSmithers was casually fitting together an intricate array of little\r\nrings made of copper tubing. There were three of them, and each was\r\nfitted into the next largest by pins which enabled them to spin\r\nnoiselessly and swiftly at the touch of Smithers' finger. He had them\r\nspinning now, each in a separate direction, and the effect was\r\nbewildering.\r\n\r\nAs Tommy watched, Smithers stopped them, oiled the pins carefully, and\r\npainstakingly inserted a fourth ring. Only this ring was of a white\r\nmetal that looked somehow more pallid than silver. It had a whiteness\r\nlike that of ivory beneath its metallic gleam.\r\n\r\nTommy blinked.\r\n\r\n\"Did Von Holtz give you that metal?\" he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nSmithers looked up and puffed at a short brown pipe.\r\n\r\n\"Nope. There was some splashes of it by the castin' box. I melted 'em\r\ntogether an' run a ring. Pressed it to shape; y' can't hammer this\r\nstuff. It goes to water and dries up quicker'n lightning--an' you hold\r\ny'nose an' run. I used it before for the Professor.\"\r\n\r\nTommy went over to him excitedly. He picked up the little contrivance\r\nof many concentric rings. The big motor was throbbing rhythmically,\r\nand the generator was humming at the back of the laboratory. Von Holtz\r\nwas out of sight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith painstaking care Tommy went over the little device. He looked up.\r\n\r\n\"A coil?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wound one,\" said Smithers calmly. \"On the lathe. Not so hot, but\r\nit'll do, I guess. But I can't fix these rings like the Professor\r\ndid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I can,\" said Tommy crisply. \"Did you make some wire for\r\nsprings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah!\"\r\n\r\nTommy fingered the wire. Stout, stiff, and surprisingly springy wire\r\nof the same peculiar metal. It was that metallic ammonium which\r\nchemists have deduced must exist because of the chemical behavior of\r\nthe compound NH3, but which Denham alone had managed to procure.\r\nTommy deduced that it was an allotropic modification of the substance\r\nwhich forms an amalgam with mercury, as metallic tin is an allotrope\r\nof the amorphous gray powder which is tin in its normal, stable state.\r\n\r\nHe set to work with feverish excitement. For one hour, for two he\r\nworked. At the end of that time he was explaining the matter curtly to\r\nSmithers, so intent on his work that he wholly failed to hear a motor\r\ncar outside or to realize that it had also grown dark in this world of\r\nours.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Smithers, if a two-dimensioned creature wanted to adjust two\r\nright angles at right angles to each other, he'd have them laid flat,\r\nof course. And if he put a spring at the far ends of those right\r\nangles--they'd look like a T, put together--so that the cross-bar of\r\nthat T was under tension, he'd have the equivalent of what I'm doing.\r\nTo make a three-dimensioned figure, that imaginary man would have to\r\nbend one side of the cross-bar up. As if the two ends of it were under\r\ntension by a spring, and the spring would only be relieved of tension\r\nwhen that cross-bar was bent. But the vertical would be his time\r\ndimension, so he'd have to have something thin, or it couldn't be\r\nbent. He'd need something 'thin in time.'\r\n\r\n\"We have the same problem. But metallic ammonium is 'thin in time.'\r\nIt's so fugitive a substance that Denham is the only man ever to\r\nsecure it. So we use these rings and adjust these springs to them so\r\nthey're under tension which will only be released when they're all at\r\nright angles to each other. In our three dimensions that's impossible,\r\nbut we have a metal that can revolve in a fourth, and we reinforce\r\ntheir tendency to adjust themselves by starting them off with a jerk.\r\nWe've got 'em flat. They'll make a good stiff jerk when they try to\r\nadjust themselves. And the solenoid's a bit eccentric--\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\" snapped Smithers suddenly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was facing the door, bristling. Von Holtz was in the act of coming\r\nin, with a beefy, broad-shouldered man with blue jowls. Tommy\r\nstraightened up, thought swiftly, and then smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Von Holtz,\" he said pleasantly. \"We've just completed a model\r\ncatapult. We're all set to try it out. Watch!\"\r\n\r\nHe set a little tin can beneath the peculiar device of copper-tubing\r\nrings. The can was wholly ordinary, made of thin sheet-iron plated\r\nwith tin as are all the tin cans of commerce.\r\n\r\n\"You have the catapult remade?\" gasped Von Holtz. \"Wait! Wait! Let me\r\nlook at it!\"\r\n\r\nFor one instant, and one instant only, Tommy let him see. The massed\r\nset of concentric rings, each one of them parallel to all the others.\r\nIt looked rather like a flat coil of tubing; certainly like no\r\nparticularly obscure form of projector. But as Von Holtz's weak eyes\r\nfastened avidly upon it, Tommy pressed the improvised electric switch.\r\nAt once that would energize the solenoid and release all the tensed\r\nsprings from their greater tension, for an attempt to reach a\r\npermanent equilibrium.\r\n\r\nAs Von Holtz and the blue-jowled man stared, the little tin can leaped\r\nupward into the tiny coil. The small copper rings twinkled one within\r\nthe other as the springs operated. The tin can was wrenched this way\r\nand that, then for the fraction of a second hurt the eyes that gazed\r\nupon it--and it was gone! And then the little coil came spinning down\r\nto the work bench top from its broken bearings and the remaining\r\ncopper rings spun aimlessly for a moment. But the third ring of\r\nwhitish metal had vanished utterly, and so had the coiled-wire springs\r\nwhich Von Holtz had been unable to distinguish. And there was an\r\noverpowering smell of ammonia in the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVon Holtz flung himself upon the still-moving little instrument. He\r\ninspected it savagely, desperately. His full red lips drew back in a\r\nsnarl.\r\n\r\n\"How did you do it?\" he cried shrilly. \"You must tell me! I--I--I will\r\nkill you if you do not tell me!\"\r\n\r\nThe blue-jowled man was watching Von Holtz. Now his lips twisted\r\ndisgustedly. He turned to Tommy and narrowed his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" he rumbled. \"This fool's no good! I want the secret of\r\nthat trick you did. What's your price?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not for sale,\" said Tommy, smiling faintly.\r\n\r\nThe blue-jowled man regarded him with level eyes.\r\n\r\n\"My name's Jacaro,\" he said after an instant. \"Maybe you've heard of\r\nme. I'm from Chicago.\"\r\n\r\nTommy smiled more widely.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" he admitted. \"You were the man who introduced\r\nmachine-guns into gang warfare, weren't you? Your gunmen lined up half\r\na dozen of the Buddy Haines gang against a wall and wiped them out, I\r\nbelieve. What do you want this secret for?\"\r\n\r\nThe level eyes narrowed. They looked suddenly deadly.\r\n\r\n\"That's my business,\" said Jacaro briefly. \"You know who I am. And I\r\nwant that trick y'did. I got my own reasons. I'll pay for it. Plenty.\r\nYou know I got plenty to pay, too. Or else--\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something'll happen to you,\" said Jacaro briefly. \"I ain't sayin''\r\nwhat. But it's damn likely you'll tell what I want to know before it's\r\nfinished. Name your price and be damn quick!\"\r\n\r\nTommy took his hand out of his pocket. He had a gun in it.\r\n\r\n\"The only possible answer to that,\" he said suavely, \"is to tell you\r\nto go to hell. Get out! But Von Holtz stays here. He'd better!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWithin half an hour after Jacaro's leaving, Smithers was in the\r\nvillage, laying in a stock of supplies and sending telegrams that\r\nTommy had written out for transmission. Tommy sat facing an ashen Von\r\nHoltz and told him pleasantly what would be done to him if he failed\r\nto make the metallic ammonium needed to repair the big solenoid. In an\r\nhour, Smithers was back, reporting that Jacaro was also sending\r\ntelegrams but that he, Smithers, had stood over the telegraph operator\r\nuntil his own messages were transmitted. He brought back weapons,\r\ntoo--highly illegal things to have in New York State, where a citizen\r\nis only law-abiding when defenseless. And then four days of hectic,\r\nsleepless labor began.\r\n\r\nOn the first day one of Tommy's friends drove in in answer to a\r\ntelegram. It was Peter Dalzell, with men in uniform apparently\r\nfestooned about his car. He announced that a placard warning passersby\r\nof smallpox within, had been added to the decorative signs upon the\r\ngate, and stared incredulously at the interior of the big brick barn.\r\nTommy grinned at him and gave him plans and specifications of a light\r\nsteel globe in which two men might be transported into the fifth\r\ndimension by a suitably operating device. Tommy had sat up all night\r\ndrawing those plans. He told Dalzell just enough of what he was up\r\nagainst to enlist Dalzell's enthusiastic cooperation without\r\npermitting him to doubt Tommy's sanity. Dalzell had known Tommy as an\r\namateur tennis player, but not as a scientist.\r\n\r\nHe marveled, refused to believe his eyes when he looked through the\r\ndimensoscope, and agreed that the whole thing had to be kept secret or\r\nthe rescue expedition would be prevented from starting by the\r\nincarceration of both Tommy and Smithers in comfortable insane\r\nasylums. He feigned to admire Von Holtz, deathly white and nearly\r\nfrantic with a corroding rage, and complimented Tommy on his taste for\r\nillegality. He even asked Von Holtz if he wanted to leave, and Von\r\nHoltz snarled insults at him. Von Holtz was beginning to work at the\r\nmanufacture of metallic ammonium.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was an electrolytic process, of course. Ordinarily,\r\nwhen--say--ammonium chloride is broken down by an electric current,\r\nammonium is deposited at the cathode and instantly becomes a gas which\r\ndissolves in the water or bubbles up to the surface. With a mercury\r\ncathode, it is dissolved and becomes a metallic amalgam, which also\r\nbreaks down into gas with much bubbling of the mercury. But Denham had\r\nworked out a way of delaying the breaking-down, which left him with a\r\ncuriously white, spongy mass of metal which could be carefully melted\r\ndown and cast, but not under any circumstances violently struck or\r\nstrained.\r\n\r\nVon Holtz was working at that. On the second day he delivered,\r\nsnarling, a small ingot of the white metal. He was imprisoned in the\r\nlean-to-shed in which the electrolysis went on. But Tommy had more\r\nthan a suspicion that he was in communication with Jacaro.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he said drily to Smithers, who had expressed his doubts.\r\n\"Jacaro had somebody sneak up and talk to him through the walls, or\r\nmaybe through a bored hole. While there's a hope of finding out what\r\nhe wants to know through Von Holtz, Jacaro won't try anything. Not\r\nanything rough, anyhow. We mustn't be bumped off while what we are\r\ndoing is in our heads alone. We're safe enough--for a while.\"\r\n\r\nSmithers grumbled.\r\n\r\n\"We need that ammonium,\" said Tommy, \"and I don't know how to make it.\r\nI bluffed that I could, and in time I might, but it would need time\r\nand meanwhile Denham needs us. Dalzell is going to send a plane over\r\ntoday, with word of when we can expect our own globe. We'll try to\r\nhave the big catapult ready when it comes. And the plane will drop\r\nsome extra supplies. I've ordered a sub-machine gun. Handy when we get\r\nover there in the tree-fern forests. Right now, though, we need to be\r\nwatching....\"\r\n\r\nBecause they were taking turns looking through the dimensoscope. For\r\nsigns of Denham and Evelyn. And Tommy was finding himself thinking\r\nwholly unscientific thoughts about Evelyn, since a pretty girl in\r\ndifficulties is of all possible things the one most likely to make a\r\nman romantic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the four days of their hardest working, he saw her three times. The\r\nglobe was wrecked and ruined. Its glass was broken out and its\r\ninterior ripped apart. It had been pillaged so exhaustively that there\r\nwas no hope that whatever device had been included in its design, for\r\nits return, remained even repairably intact. That device had not\r\nworked, to be sure, but Tommy puzzled sometimes over the fact that he\r\nhad seen no mechanical device of any sort in the plunder that had been\r\nbrought out to be demolished. But he did not think of those things\r\nwhen he saw Evelyn.\r\n\r\nThe Ragged Men's encampment was gone, but she and her father lingered\r\nfurtively, still near the pillaged globe. The first day Tommy saw her,\r\nshe was still blooming and alert. The second day she was paler. Her\r\nclothing was ripped and torn, as if by thorns. Denham had a great raw\r\nwound upon his forehead, and his coat was gone and half his shirt was\r\nin ribbons. Before Tommy's eyes they killed a nameless small animal\r\nwith the trunchionlike weapon Evelyn carried. And Denham carted it\r\ntriumphantly off into the shelter of the tree-fern forest. But to\r\nTommy that shelter began to appear extremely dubious.\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon some of the Ragged Men came suspiciously to the\r\nglobe and inspected it, and then vented a gibbering rage upon it with\r\nblows and curses. They seemed half-mad, these men. But then, all the\r\nRagged Men seemed a shade less than sane. Their hatred for the Golden\r\nCity seemed the dominant emotion of their existence.\r\n\r\nAnd when they had gone, Tommy saw Denham peering cautiously from\r\nbehind a screening mass of fern. And Denham looked sick at heart. His\r\neyes lifted suddenly to the heavens, and he stared off into the\r\ndistance again, and then he regarded the heavens again with an\r\nexpression that was at once of the utmost wistfulness and the\r\nuttermost of despair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy swung the dimensoscope about and searched the skies of that\r\nother world. He saw the flying machine, and it was a swallow-winged\r\ndevice that moved swiftly, and now soared and swooped in abrupt short\r\ncircles almost overhead. Tommy could see its pilot, leaning out to\r\ngaze downward. He was no more than a hundred feet up, almost at the\r\nheight of the tree-fern tops. And the pilot was moving too swiftly for\r\nTommy to be able to focus accurately upon his face, but he could see\r\nhim as a man, an indubitable man in no fashion distinguishable from\r\nthe other men of this earth. He was scrutinizing the globe as well as\r\nhe could without alighting.\r\n\r\nHe soared upward, suddenly, and his plane dwindled as it went toward\r\nthe Golden City.\r\n\r\nAnd then, inevitably, Tommy searched for the four Ragged Men who had\r\ninspected the globe a little while since. He saw them, capering\r\nhorribly behind a screening of verdure. They did not shake their\r\nclenched fists at the flying machine. Instead, they seemed filled with\r\na ghastly mirth. And suddenly they began to run frantically for the\r\nfar distance, as if bearing news of infinite importance.\r\n\r\nAnd when he looked back at Denham, it seemed to Tommy that he wrung\r\nhis hands before he disappeared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut that was the second day of the work upon our own world, and just\r\nbefore sunset there was a droning in the earthly sky above the\r\nlaboratory, and Tommy ran out, and somebody shot at him from a patch\r\nof woodland a quarter of a mile away from the brick building. Isolated\r\nas Denham's place was, the shot would go unnoticed. The bullet passed\r\nwithin a few feet of Tommy, but he paid no attention. It was one of\r\nJacaro's watchers, no doubt, but Jacaro did not want Tommy killed. So\r\nTommy waited until the plane swooped low--almost to the level of the\r\nlaboratory roof--and a thickly padded package thudded to the ground.\r\nHe picked it up and darted back into the laboratory as other bullets\r\ncame from the patch of woodland.\r\n\r\n\"Funny,\" he said dryly to Smithers, inside the laboratory again; \"they\r\ndon't dare kill me--yet--and Von Holtz doesn't dare leave or refuse to\r\ndo what I tell him to do; and yet they expect to lick us.\"\r\n\r\nSmithers growled. Tommy was unpacking the wrapped package. A grim,\r\nblued-steel thing came out of much padding. Boxes tumbled after it.\r\n\r\n\"Sub-machine gun,\" said Tommy, \"and ammunition. Jacaro and his little\r\npals will try to get in here when they think we've got the big\r\nsolenoid ready for use. They'll try to get it before we can use it.\r\nThis will attend to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' get us in jail,\" said Smithers calmly, \"for forty-'leven years.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Tommy, and grinned. \"We'll be in the fifth dimension. Our\r\njob is to fling through the catapult all the stuff we'll need to make\r\nanother catapult to fling us back again.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't be done,\" said Smithers flatly.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe not,\" agreed Tommy, \"especially since we ruin all our springs\r\nand one gymbal ring every time we use the thing. But I've got an idea.\r\nI'll want five coils with hollow iron cores, and the whole works\r\nshaped like this, with two holes bored so....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe sketched. He had been working on the idea for several days, and the\r\nsketch was ready in his mind to be transferred to paper.\r\n\r\n\"What you goin' to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something crazy,\" said Tommy. \"A mirror isn't the only thing that\r\nchanges angles to right ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the doctor,\" said the imperturbable Smithers.\r\n\r\nHe set to work. He puzzled Tommy sometimes, Smithers did. So far he\r\nhadn't asked how much his pay was going to be. He'd worked\r\nunintermittantly. He had displayed a colossal, a tremendous calmness.\r\nBut no man could work as hard as Smithers did without some powerful\r\ndriving-force. It was on the fourth day that Tommy learned what it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nThe five coils had been made, and Tommy was assembling them with an\r\nextraordinary painstaking care behind a screen, to hide what he was\r\ndoing. He'd discovered a peep-hole bored through the brick wall from\r\nthe lean-to where Von Holtz worked. He was no longer locked in there.\r\nTommy abandoned the pretense of imprisonment after finding an\r\nautomatic pistol and a duplicate key to the lock in Von Holtz's\r\npossession. He'd had neither when he was theoretically locked up, and\r\nTommy laughed.\r\n\r\n\"It's a farce, Von Holtz,\" he said dryly, \"this pretending you'll run\r\naway. You're here spying now, for Jacaro. Of course. And you don't\r\ndare harm either of us until you find out from me what you can't work\r\nout for yourself, and know I have done. How much is Jacaro going to\r\npay you for the secret of the catapult, Von Holtz?\"\r\n\r\nVon Holtz snarled. Smithers moved toward him, his hands closing and\r\nunclosing. Von Holtz went gray with terror.\r\n\r\n\"Talk!\" said Smithers.\r\n\r\n\"A--a million dollars,\" said Von Holtz, cringing away from the brawny\r\nred-headed man.\r\n\r\n\"It would be interesting to know what use it would be to him,\" said\r\nTommy dryly. \"But to earn that million you have to learn what we know.\r\nAnd to learn that, you have to help us do it again, on the scale we\r\nwant. You won't run away. So I shan't bother to lock you up hereafter.\r\nJacaro's men come and talk to you at night, don't they?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVon Holtz cringed again. It was an admission.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to have to kill any of them,\" said Tommy pleasantly,\r\n\"and we'll all be classed as mad if this thing gets out. So you go and\r\ntalk to them in the lane when you want to, Von Holtz. But if any of\r\nthem come near the laboratory, Smithers and I will kill them, and if\r\nSmithers is hurt I'll kill you; and I don't imagine Jacaro wants that,\r\nbecause he expects you to build another catapult for him. But I warn\r\nyou, if I find another gun on you I'll thrash you.\"\r\n\r\nVon Holtz's pallor changed subtly from the pallor of fear to the awful\r\nlividness of rage.\r\n\r\n\"You--Gott! You dare threaten--\" He choked upon his own fury.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Tommy. \"And I'll carry out the threat.\"\r\n\r\nSmithers moved forward once more.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Von Holtz,\" he said in a very terrible steadiness, \"I aim to kill\r\nyou some time. I ain't done it yet because Mr. Reames says he needs\r\nyou a while. But I know you got Miss Evelyn marooned off in them\r\nfern-woods on purpose! And--God knows she wouldn't ever look at me,\r\nbut--I aim to kill you some time!\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes were flames. His hands closed and unclosed horribly. Von\r\nHoltz gaped at him, shocked out of his fury into fear again. He went\r\nunsteadily back to his lean-to. And Smithers went back to the\r\ndimensoscope. It was his turn to watch that other world for signs of\r\nDenham and Evelyn, and for any sign of danger to them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy adjusted the screen before the bench on which he was working, so\r\nVon Holtz could not see his task, and went back to work. It was a\r\nrather intricate task he had undertaken, and before the events of the\r\npast few days he would have said it was insane. But now he was taking\r\nit quite casually.\r\n\r\nPresently he said:\r\n\r\n\"Smithers.\"\r\n\r\nSmithers did not look away from the brass tube.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're thinking more about Miss Denham than her father.\"\r\n\r\nSmithers did not reply for a moment. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\"Well? What if I am?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, too,\" said Tommy quietly. \"I've never spoken to her, and I\r\ndaresay she's never even heard of me, and she certainly has never seen\r\nme, but--\"\r\n\r\nSmithers said with a vast calmness:\r\n\r\n\"She'll never look at me, Mr. Reames. I know it. She talks to me, an'\r\nlaughs with me, but she's never sure-'nough looked at me. An' she\r\nnever will. But I got the right to love her.\"\r\n\r\nTommy nodded very gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You have. So have I. And so, when that globe comes, we both get\r\ninto it with what arms and ammunition we can pack in, and go where she\r\nis, to help her. I intended to have you work the switch and send me\r\noff. But you can come, too.\"\r\n\r\nSmithers was silent. But he took his eyes from the dimensoscope\r\neye-piece and regarded Tommy soberly. Then he nodded and turned back.\r\nAnd it was a compact between the two men that they should serve\r\nEvelyn, without any rivalry at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy went on with his work. The essential defect in the catapult\r\nDenham had designed was the fact that it practically had to be rebuilt\r\nafter each use. And, moreover, the metallic ammonium was so fugitive a\r\nsubstance that it was hard to keep. Once it had been strained by\r\nworking, it gradually adverted to a gaseous state and was lost. And\r\nwhile he still tried to keep the little catapult in a condition for\r\nuse, he was at no time sure that he could send a pair of automatics\r\nand ammunition through in a steel box at any moment that Denham came\r\nclose enough to notice a burning smoke-fuse attached.\r\n\r\nBut he was working on another form of catapult entirely, now. In this\r\ncase he was using hollow magnets placed at known angles to each other.\r\nAnd they were so designed that each one tended to adjust its own\r\nhollow bore at right angles to the preceding one, and each one would\r\ntake any moving, magnetic object and swing it through four successive\r\nright angles into the fifth dimension.\r\n\r\nHe fitted the first magnet on twin rods of malleable copper, which\r\nalso would carry the current which energized the coil. He threaded the\r\nsecond upon the same twin supports. When the current was passed\r\nthrough the two of them, the magnetic field itself twisted the\r\nmagnets, bending the copper supports and placing the magnets in their\r\nproper relative positions. A third magnet on the same pair of rods,\r\nand a repetition of the experiment, proved the accuracy of the idea.\r\nAnd since this device, like the dimensoscope, required only a\r\nforty-five degree angle to our known dimensions, instead of a right\r\nangle as the other catapult did, Tommy was able to work with ordinary\r\nand durable materials. He fitted on the last two coils and turned on\r\nthe current for his final experiment. And as he watched, the twin\r\nthree-eighths-inch rods twisted and writhed in the grip of the\r\nintangible magnetic force. They bent, and quivered, and twisted....\r\nAnd suddenly there seemed to be a sort of inaudible _snap_, and one of\r\nthe magnets hurt the eyes that looked at it, and only the edge of the\r\nlast of the series was visible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy drew in his breath sharply. \"Now we try it,\" he said tensely. \"I\r\nwas trying to work this as the mirrors of the dimensoscope were\r\nfitted. Let's see.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a long piece of soft-iron wire and fed it into the hollow of\r\nthe first magnet. He saw it come out and bend stiffly to enter the\r\nhollow of the second. It required force to thrust it through. It went\r\nstill more stiffly into the third magnet. It required nearly all his\r\nstrength to thrust it on, and on.... The end of it vanished. He pushed\r\ntwo feet or more of it beyond the last place where it was visible. It\r\nwent into the magnet that hurt one's eyes. After that it could not be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nTommy's voice was strained.\r\n\r\n\"Swing the dimensoscope, Smithers,\" he ordered. \"See if you can see\r\nthe wire. The end of it should be in the other world.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed an age, an aeon, that Smithers searched. Then:\r\n\r\n\"Move it,\" he said.\r\n\r\nTommy obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"It's there,\" said Smithers evenly. \"Two or three feet of it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy drew a deep, swift breath of relief.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" he said crisply. \"Now we can fling anything we need\r\nthrough there, when our globe arrives. We can built up a dump of\r\nsupplies, all sent through just before we slide through in the globe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Smithers. \"Uh--Mr. Reames. There's a bunch of Ragged Men\r\nin sight, hauling something heavy behind them. I don't know what it's\r\nall about.\"\r\n\r\nTommy went to the brass tube and stared through it. The tree-fern\r\nforest, drawing away in the distance. The vast and steaming morass.\r\nThe glittering city, far, far in the distance.\r\n\r\nAnd then a mob of the Ragged Men, hauling at some heavy thing. They\r\nwere a long way off. Some of them came capering on ahead, and Tommy\r\nswung the dimensoscope about to see Denham and Evelyn dart for cover\r\nand vanish amid the tree-ferns. Denham was as ragged as the Ragged\r\nMen, by now, and Evelyn's case was little better.\r\n\r\nFrightened for them, Tommy swung the instrument about again. But they\r\nhad not been seen. The leaders who ran gleefully on ahead were merely\r\nin haste. And they were followed more slowly by burly men and lean\r\nones, whole men and limping men, who hauled frantically on long ropes\r\nof hide, dragging some heavy thing behind them. Tommy saw it only\r\nindistinctly as the filthy, nearly naked bodies moved. But it was an\r\nintricate device of a golden-colored metal, and it rested upon the\r\ncrudest of possible carts. The wheels were sections of tree trunks,\r\npierced for wooden axles. The cart itself was made of the most\r\nroughly-hewed of timbers. And there were fifty or more of the Ragged\r\nMen who dragged it.\r\n\r\nThe men in advance now attacked the underbrush at the edge of the\r\nforest. They worked with a maniacal energy, clearing away the long\r\nfern-fronds while they capered and danced and babbled excitedly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIrrelevantly, Tommy thought of escaped galley slaves. Just such\r\nhard-bitten, vice-ridden men as these, and filled with just such a\r\nmad, gibbering hatred of the free men they had escaped from. Certainly\r\nthese men had been civilized once. As the golden-metal device came\r\nnearer, its intricacy was the more apparent. No savages could utilize\r\na device like this one. And there was a queer deadliness in the very\r\ngrace of its outlines. It was a weapon of some sort, but whose nature\r\nTommy could not even guess.\r\n\r\nAnd then he caught the gleam of metal also in the fern-forest. On the\r\nground. In glimpses and in fragments of glimpses between the swarming\r\nnaked bodies of the Ragged Men, he pieced together a wholly incredible\r\nimpression. There was a roadway skirting the edge of the forest. It\r\nwas not wide; not more than fifteen feet at most. But it was a solid\r\nroad-bed of metal! The dull silver-white of aluminum gleamed from the\r\nground. Two or more inches thick and fifteen feet wide, there was a\r\nseamless ribbon of aluminum that vanished behind the tree-ferns on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\nThe intricate device of golden metal was set up, now, and a shaggy,\r\nsavage-seeming man mounted beside it grinning. He manipulated its\r\nlevers and wheels with an expert's assurance. And Tommy saw repairs\r\nupon it. Crude repairs, with crude materials, but expertly done. Done\r\nby the Ragged Men, past doubt, and so demolishing any idea that they\r\ncame of a savage race.\r\n\r\n\"Watch here, Smithers,\" said Tommy grimly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe sat to work upon the little catapult after Denham's design. His own\r\nhad seemed to work, but the other was more sure. This would be an\r\nambush the Ragged Men were preparing, and of course they would be\r\npreparing it for men of the Golden City. The plane had sighted\r\nDenham's steel globe. It had hovered overhead, and carried news of\r\nwhat it had seen to the Golden City. And here was a roadway that must\r\nhave been made by the folk of the Golden City at some time or another.\r\nIts existence explained why Denham remained nearby. He had been hoping\r\nthat some vehicle would travel along its length, containing civilized\r\npeople to whom he could signal and ultimately explain his plight. And,\r\nbeing near the steel globe, his narrative would have its proofs at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was clear that the Ragged Men expected some ground-vehicle,\r\ntoo. They were preparing for it. They were setting a splendid ambush,\r\nwith a highly-treasured weapon they ordinarily kept hidden. Their\r\ntriumphant hatred could apply to nothing else than an expectation of\r\ninflicting injury on men of the Golden City.\r\n\r\nSo Tommy worked swiftly upon the catapult. A new little ring of\r\nmetallic ammonium was ready, and so were the necessary springs. The\r\nRagged Men would lay their ambush. The men of the Golden City might\r\nenter it. They might. But the aviator who had spotted the globe would\r\nhave seen the shredded contents of the sphere about. He would have\r\nknown the Ragged Men had found it. And the men who came in a\r\nground-vehicle from the Golden City should be expecting just such an\r\nambush as was being laid.\r\n\r\nThere would be a fight, and Tommy, somehow, had no doubt that the men\r\nof the Golden City would win. And when they had cleared the field he\r\nwould fling a smoking missile through the catapult. The victors should\r\nsee it and should examine it. And though writing would serve little\r\npurpose, they should at least recognize it as written communication in\r\na language other than their own. And mathematical diagrams would\r\ncertainly be lucid, and proof of a civilized man sending the missile,\r\nand photographs....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe catapult was ready, and Tommy prepared his message-carrying\r\nprojectile. He found snapshots and included them. He tore out a\r\nphotograph of Evelyn and her father, which had been framed above a\r\nwork bench in the laboratory. He labored, racking his brain for a\r\nmeans of conveying the information that the globe was of any other\r\nworld.... And suddenly he had an idea. A cord attached to his missile\r\nwould lead to nothingness from either world, yet one end would be in\r\nthat other world, and the other end in this. A wire would be better.\r\nTugs upon it would convey the idea of living beings nearby but\r\ninvisible. The photograph would identify Denham and his daughter as\r\nassociated with the phenomenon and competent to explain it....\r\n\r\nTommy worked frantically to get the thing ready. He almost prayed that\r\nthe men of the Golden City would be victors, would find his little\r\nmissile when the fray was over, and would try to comprehend it....\r\n\r\nAll he could do was try.\r\n\r\nThen Smithers said, from the dimensoscope:\r\n\r\n\"They're all set, Mr. Reames. Y'better look.\"\r\n\r\nTommy stared through the eye-piece. Strangely, the golden weapon had\r\nvanished. All seemed to be exactly as before. The cleared-away\r\nunderbrush was replaced. Nothing was in any way changed from the\r\nnormal in that space upon a mad world. But there was a tiny movement\r\nand Tommy saw a Ragged Man. He was lying prone upon the earth. He\r\nseemed either to hear or see something, because his lips moved as he\r\nspoke to another invisible man beside him, and his expression of\r\nmalevolent joy was horrible.\r\n\r\nTommy swung the tube about. Nothing.... But suddenly he saw\r\nswiftly-moving winkings of sunlight from the edge of the tree-fern\r\nforest. Something was moving in there, moving with lightning swiftness\r\nalong the fifteen-foot roadway of solid aluminum. It drew nearer, and\r\nmore near....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe carefully camouflaged ambuscade was fully focussed and Tommy was\r\nwatching tensely when the thing happened.\r\n\r\nHe saw glitterings through the tree-fronds come to a smoothly\r\ndecelerated stop. There was a pause; and suddenly the underbrush fell\r\nflat. As if a single hand had smitten it, it wavered, drooped, and lay\r\nprone. The golden weapon was exposed, with its brawny and horribly\r\ngrinning attendant. For one-half a split second Tommy saw the wheeled\r\nthing in which half a dozen men of the Golden City were riding. It was\r\ngraceful and stream-lined and glittering. There was a platform on\r\nwhich the steel sphere would have been mounted for carrying away.\r\n\r\nBut then there was a sudden intolerable light as the men of the Golden\r\nCity reached swiftly for peculiar weapons beside them. The light came\r\nfrom the crudely mounted weapon of the Ragged Men, and it was an\r\nunbearable actinic glare. For half a second, perhaps, it persisted,\r\nand died away to a red flame which leaped upward and was not.\r\n\r\nThen the vehicle from the Golden City was a smoking, twisted ruin.\r\nFour of the six men in it were blasted, blackened crisps. Another\r\nstaggered to his feet, struggled to reach a weapon and could not lift\r\nit, and twitched a dagger from his belt and fell forward; and Tommy\r\ncould see that his suicide was deliberate.\r\n\r\nThe last man, alone, was comparatively unharmed by the blast of light.\r\nHe swept a pistol-like contrivance into sight. It bore swiftly upon\r\nthe now surging, yelling horde of Ragged Men. And one--two--three of\r\nthem seemed to scream convulsively before they were trampled under by\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly there were a myriad little specks of red all over the\r\nbody of the man at bay. The pistol-like thing dropped from his grasp\r\nas his whole hand became encrimsoned. And then he was buried beneath\r\nthe hating, blood-lusting mob of the forest men.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Tommy took his eyes away from the dimensoscope\r\neye-piece. He could not bear to look any longer.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't they kill him?\" he demanded sickly, filled with a horrible,\r\na monstrous rage. \"Oh, why don't they kill him?\"\r\n\r\nHe felt maddeningly impotent. In another world entirely, a mob of\r\nhalf-naked renegades had made a prisoner. He was not dead, that solely\r\nsurviving man from the Golden City. He was bound, and the Ragged Men\r\nguarded him closely, and his guards were diverting themselves\r\nunspeakably by small tortures, minor tortures, horribly painful but\r\nnot weakening. And they capered and howled with glee when the bound\r\nman writhed.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner was a brave man, though. Helpless as he was, he presently\r\nflung back his head and set his teeth. Sweat stood out in great\r\ndroplets upon his body and upon his forehead. And he stilled his\r\nwrithings, and looked at his captors with a grim and desperate\r\ndefiance.\r\n\r\nThe guards made gestures which were all too clear, all too luridly\r\ndescriptive of the manner of death which awaited him. And the man of\r\nthe Golden City was ashen and hopeless and utterly despairing--and yet\r\ndefiant.\r\n\r\nSmithers took Tommy's place at the eye-piece of the instrument. His\r\nnostrils quivered at what he saw. The vehicle from the Golden City was\r\nbeing plundered, of course. Weapons from the dead men were being\r\nsquabbled over, even fought over. And the Ragged Men fought as madly\r\namong themselves as if in combat with their enemies. The big golden\r\nweapon on its cart was already being dragged away to its former\r\nhiding-place. And somehow, it was clear that those who dragged it away\r\nexpected and demanded that the solitary prisoner not be killed until\r\ntheir return.\r\n\r\nIt was that prisoner, in the agony which was only the beginning of his\r\ndeath, who made Smithers' teeth set tightly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I don't see the Professor or Miss Evelyn,\" said Smithers in a vast\r\ncalmness. \"I hope to Gawd they--don't see this.\"\r\n\r\nTommy swung on his heel, staring and ashen.\r\n\r\n\"They were near,\" he said stridently. \"I saw them! They saw what\r\nhappened in the ambush! They'll--they'll see that man tortured!\"\r\n\r\nSmithers' hand closed and unclosed.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe the Professor'll have sense enough to take Miss\r\nEvelyn--uh--where she--can't hear,\" he said slowly, his voice level.\r\n\"I hope so.\"\r\n\r\nTommy flung out his hands desperately.\r\n\r\n\"I want to help that man!\" he cried savagely. \"I want to do something!\r\nI saw what they promised to do to him. I want to--to kill him, even!\r\nIt would be mercy!\"\r\n\r\nSmithers said, with a queer, stilly shock in his voice:\r\n\r\n\"I see the Professor now. He's got that gun-thing in his hand.... Miss\r\nEvelyn's urging him to try to do something.... He's looking at the\r\nsky.... It'll be a long time before it's dark.... He's gone back out\r\nof sight....\"\r\n\r\n\"If we had some dynamite!\" said Tommy desperately, \"we could take a\r\nchance on blowing ourselves to bits and try to fling it through and\r\ninto the middle of those devils....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was pacing up and down the laboratory, harrowed by the fate of that\r\ngray-faced man who awaited death by torture; filled with a wild terror\r\nthat Evelyn and her father would try to rescue him and be caught to\r\nshare his fate; racked by his utter impotence to do more than\r\nwatch....\r\n\r\nThen Smithers said thickly:\r\n\r\n\"God!\"\r\n\r\nHe stumbled away from the eye-piece. Tommy took his place,\r\ndry-throated with terror. He saw the Ragged Men laughing uproariously.\r\nThe bearded man who was their leader was breaking the arms and legs of\r\nthe prisoner so that he would be helpless when released from the stake\r\nto which he was bound. And if ever human beings looked like devils out\r\nof hell, it was at that moment. The method of breaking the bones was\r\nexcruciating. The prisoner screamed. The Ragged Men rolled upon the\r\nground in their maniacal mirth.\r\n\r\nAnd then a man dropped, heaving convulsively, and then another, and\r\nstill another.... The grim, gaunt figure of Denham came out of the\r\ntree-fern forest, the queer small golden-metal trunchion in his hand.\r\nA fourth man dropped before the Ragged Men quite realized what had\r\nhappened. The fourth man himself was armed--and a flashing slender\r\nbody came plunging from the forest and Evelyn flung herself upon the\r\nstill-heaving body and plucked away that weapon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy groaned, in the laboratory in another world. He could not look\r\naway, and yet it seemed that the heart would be torn from his body by\r\nthat sight. Because the Ragged Men had turned upon Denham with a\r\nconcentrated ferocity, somehow knowing instantly that he was more\r\nnearly akin to the men of the Golden City than to them. But at sight\r\nof Evelyn, her garments rent by the thorns of the forest, her white\r\nbody gleaming through the largest tears, they seemed to go mad. And\r\nTommy's eyes, glazing, saw the look on Denham's face as he realized\r\nthat Evelyn had not fled, but had followed him in his desperate and\r\nwholly hopeless effort.\r\n\r\nThen the swarming mass of Ragged Men surged over the two of them.\r\nBuried them under reaching, hating, lusting fiends who fought even\r\namong themselves to be first to seize them.\r\n\r\nThen there was only madness, and Denham was bound beside the man of\r\nthe Golden City, and Evelyn was the center of a fighting group which\r\nwas suddenly flung aside by the bearded giant, and the encampment of\r\nthe Ragged Men was bedlam. And somehow Tommy knew with a terrible\r\nclarity that a man of the Golden City to torture was bliss\r\nunimaginable to these half-mad enemies of that city. But a woman--\r\n\r\nHe turned from the instrument, three-quarters out of his head. He\r\nliterally did not see Von Holtz gazing furtively in the doorway. His\r\neyes were fixed and staring. It seemed that his brain would burst.\r\n\r\nThen he heard his own voice saying with an altogether unbelievable\r\nsteadiness:\r\n\r\n\"Smithers! They've got Evelyn. Get the sub-machine gun.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSmithers cried out hoarsely. His face was not quite human, for an\r\ninstant. But Tommy was bringing the work bench on which he had\r\ninstalled his magnetic catapult, close over by the dimensoscope.\r\n\r\n\"This cannot work,\" he said in the same incredible calmness. \"Not\r\npossibly. It should not work. It will not work. But it has to work!\"\r\n\r\nHe was clamping the catapult to a piece of heavy timber.\r\n\r\n\"Put the gun so it shoots into the first magnet,\" he said steadily.\r\n\"The magnet-windings shouldn't stand the current we've got to put into\r\nthem. They've got to.\"\r\n\r\nSmithers' fingers were trembling and unsteady. Tommy helped him, not\r\nlooking through the dimensoscope at all.\r\n\r\n\"Start the dynamo,\" he said evenly--and marveled foolishly at the\r\nvoice that did not seem to belong to him at all, talking so steadily\r\nand so quietly. \"Give me all the juice you've got. We'll cut out this\r\nrheostat.\"\r\n\r\nHe was tightening a vise which would hold the deadly little weapon in\r\nplace while Smithers got the crude-oil engine going and accelerated it\r\nrecklessly to its highest speed. Tommy flung the switch. Rubber\r\ninsulation steamed and stank. He pulled the trigger of the little gun\r\nfor a single shot. The bullet flew into the first hollow magnet, just\r\nas he had beforehand thrust an iron wire. It vanished. The series of\r\nmagnets seemed unharmed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith a peculiar, dreamlike steadiness, Tommy put his hand where an\r\nundeflected bullet would go through it. He pressed the trigger again.\r\nHe felt a tiny breeze upon his hand. But the bullet had been unable to\r\nelude the compound-wound magnets, each of which now had quite four\r\ntimes the designed voltage impressed upon its coils.\r\n\r\nTommy flung off the switch.\r\n\r\n\"Work the gun,\" he ordered harshly. \"When I say fire, send a burst of\r\nshots through it. Keep the switch off except when you're actually\r\nfiring, so--God willing--the coils don't burn out. Fire!\"\r\n\r\nHe was gazing through the dimensoscope. Evelyn was struggling\r\nhelplessly while two Ragged Men held her arms, grinning as only devils\r\ncould have grinned, and others squabbled and watched with a fascinated\r\nattention some cryptic process which could only be the drawing of\r\nlots....\r\n\r\nTommy saw, and paid no attention. The machine-gun beside him rasped\r\nsuddenly. He saw a tree-fern frond shudder. He saw a gaping, irregular\r\nhole where a fresh frond was uncurling. Tommy put out his hand to the\r\ngun.\r\n\r\n\"Let me move it, bench and all,\" he said steadily. \"Now try it again.\r\nJust a burst.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain the gun rasped. And the earth was kicked up suddenly where the\r\nbullets struck in that other world. The little steel-jacketed missiles\r\nwere deflected by the terribly overstrained magnets of the catapult,\r\nbut their energy was not destroyed. It was merely altered in\r\ndirection. Fired within the laboratory upon our own and normal world,\r\nthe bullets came out into the world of tree-ferns and monstrous\r\nthings. They came out, as it happened, sideways instead of point\r\nfirst, which was due to some queer effect of dimension change upon an\r\nobject moving at high velocity. Because of that, they ricocheted much\r\nmore readily, and where they struck they made a much more ghastly\r\nwound. But the first two bursts caused no effect at all. They were not\r\neven noticed by the Ragged Men. The noise of the little gun was\r\nthunderous and snarling in the laboratory, but in the world of the\r\nfifth dimension there was no sound at all.\r\n\r\n\"Like this,\" said Tommy steadily. \"Just like this.... Now fire!\"\r\n\r\nHe had tilted the muzzle upward. And then with a horrible grim\r\nintensity he traversed the gun as it roared.\r\n\r\nAnd it was butchery. Three Ragged Men were cut literally to bits\r\nbefore the storm of bullets began to do real damage. The squabbling\r\ngroup, casting lots for Evelyn, had a swathe of dead men in its midst\r\nbefore snarls begun had been completed.\r\n\r\n\"Again,\" said Tommy coldly. \"Again, Smithers, again!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd again the little gun roared. The burly bearded man clutched at his\r\nthroat--and it was a gory horror. A Thing began to run insanely. It\r\ndid not even look human any longer. It stumbled over the leader of the\r\nRagged Men and died as he had done. The bullets came tumbling over\r\nthemselves erratically. They swooped and curved and dispersed\r\nthemselves crazily. Spinning as they were, at right angles to their\r\nline of flight, their trajectories were incalculable and their impacts\r\nwere grisly.\r\n\r\nThe little gun fired ten several bursts, aimed in a desperate\r\ncold-bloodedness, before the smell of burnt rubber became suddenly\r\noverpowering and the rasping sound of an electric arc broke through\r\nthe rumbling of the crude-oil engine in the back.\r\n\r\nSmithers sobbed.\r\n\r\n\"Burnt out!\"\r\n\r\nBut Tommy waved his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" he said savagely, \"that maybe a dozen of them got away.\r\nEvelyn's staggering toward her father. She'll turn him loose. That\r\nprisoner's dead, though. Didn't mean to shoot him, but those bullets\r\nflew wild.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave Smithers the eye-piece. Sweat was rolling down his forehead in\r\ngreat drops. His hands were trembling uncontrollably.\r\n\r\nHe paced shakenly up and down the laboratory, trying to shut out of\r\nhis own sight the things he had seen when the bullets of his own\r\naiming literally splashed into the living flesh of men. He had seen\r\nRagged Men disemboweled by those spinning, knifelike projectiles. He\r\nhad turned a part of the mad world of that other dimension into a\r\nshambles, and he did not regret it because he had saved Evelyn, but he\r\nwanted to shut out the horror of seeing what he had done.\r\n\r\n\"But now,\" he said uncertainly to himself, \"they're no better off,\r\nexcept they've got weapons.... If that man from the Golden City hadn't\r\nbeen killed....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was looking at the magnetic catapult, burned out and useless. His\r\neyes swung suddenly to the other one. Just a little while since he had\r\nmade ready a missile to be thrown through into the other world by\r\nthat. It contained snapshots, and diagrams, and it was an attempt to\r\ncommunicate with the men of the Golden City without any knowledge of\r\ntheir language.\r\n\r\n\"But--I can communicate with Denham!\"\r\n\r\nHe began to write feverishly. If he had looked out of the laboratory\r\nwindow, he would have seen Von Holtz running like a deer, waving his\r\narms jerkily, and--when out of earshot of the laboratory--shouting\r\nloudly. And Von Holtz was carrying a small black box which Tommy would\r\nhave identified instantly as a motion picture camera, built for\r\namateurs but capable of taking pictures indoors and with a\r\nsurprisingly small amount of light. And if Tommy had listened, he\r\nmight possibly have heard the beginnings of those shoutings to men\r\nhidden in a patch of woodland about a quarter of a mile away. The men,\r\nof course, were Jacaro's, waiting until either Von Holtz had secured\r\nthe information that was wanted, or until an assault in force upon the\r\nlaboratory would net them a catapult ready for use--to be examined,\r\nphotographed, and duplicated at leisure.\r\n\r\nBut Tommy neither looked nor listened. He wrote feverishly, saying to\r\nSmithers at the dimensoscope:\r\n\r\n\"Denham'll be looking around to see what killed those men. When he\r\ndoes, we want to be ready to shoot a smoke-bomb through to him, with a\r\nmessage attached.\"\r\n\r\nSmithers made a gesture of no especial meaning save that he had heard.\r\nAnd Tommy went on writing swiftly, saying who he was and what he had\r\ndone, and that another globe was being built so that he and Smithers\r\ncould come with supplies and arms to help....\r\n\r\n\"He's lookin'' around now, Mr. Reames,\" said Smithers quietly. \"He's\r\npicked up a ricocheted bullet an' is staring at it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe crude-oil engine was running at a thunderous rate. Tommy fastened\r\nhis note in the little missile he had made ready. He placed it under\r\nthe solenoid of the catapult after Denham's design, with the springs\r\nand rings of metallic ammonium. He turned to Smithers.\r\n\r\n\"I'll watch for him,\" said Tommy unsteadily. \"You know, watch for the\r\nright moment to fling it through. Slow up the generator a little.\r\nIt'll rack itself to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nHe put his eye to the eye-piece. He winced as he saw again what the\r\nbullets of his aiming had done. But he saw Denham almost at once. And\r\nDenham was scratched and bruised and looked very far indeed from the\r\nideal of a professor of theoretic physics, with hardly more than a few\r\nshreds of clothing left upon him, and a ten-day's beard upon his face.\r\nHe limped as he walked. But he had stopped in the task of gathering up\r\nweapons to show Evelyn excitedly what it was that he had found. A\r\nspent and battered bullet, but indubitably a bullet from the world of\r\nhis own ken. He began to stare about him, hopeful yet incredulous.\r\n\r\nTommy took his eye from the dimensoscope just long enough to light the\r\nfuse of the smoke-bomb.\r\n\r\n\"Here it goes, Smithers!\"\r\n\r\nHe flung the switch. The missile with its thickly smoking fuse leaped\r\nupward as the concentric rings flickered and whirled bewilderingly.\r\nThe missile hurt the eyes that watched it. It vanished. The solenoid\r\ndropped to the floor from the broken small contrivance.\r\n\r\nThen Tommy's heart stood still as he gazed through the eye-piece\r\nagain. He could see nothing but an opaque milkiness. But it drifted\r\naway, and he realised that it was smoke. More, Denham was staring at\r\nit. More yet, he was moving cautiously towards its source, one of the\r\nstrange golden weapons held ready....\r\n\r\nDenham was investigating.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe generator at the back of the laboratory slowed down. Smithers was\r\nobeying orders. Tommy hung close by the vision instrument, his hands\r\nmoving vaguely and helplessly, as one makes gestures without volition\r\nwhen anxious for someone else to duplicate the movements for which he\r\nsets the example.\r\n\r\nHe saw Denham, very near, inspecting the smoking thing on the ground\r\nsuspiciously. The smoke-fuse ceased to burn. Denham stared. After an\r\nage-long delay, he picked up the missile Tommy had prepared. And Tommy\r\nsaw that there was a cord attached to it. He had fastened that cord\r\nwhen planning to try to communicate with the men of the Golden City,\r\nwhen he had expected them to be victorious.\r\n\r\nBut he saw Denham's face light up with pathetic hope. He called to\r\nEvelyn. He hobbled excitedly to her, babbling....\r\n\r\nTommy watched, and his heart pounded suddenly as Evelyn turned and\r\nsmiled in the direction in which she knew the dimensoscope must be. A\r\nhuge butterfly, its wings a full yard across, fluttered past her head.\r\nDenham talked excitedly to her. A clumsy batlike thing swooped by\r\noverhead. Its shadow blanketed her face for an instant. A running\r\nanimal, small and long, ran swiftly in full view from one side of the\r\ndimensoscope's field of vision to the other. Then a snake, curiously\r\nhorned, went writhing past....\r\n\r\nDenham talked excitedly. He turned and made gestures as of writing,\r\ntoward the spot where he had picked up Tommy's message. He began to\r\nsearch for a charred stick where the Ragged Men had built a fire some\r\ndays now past. A fleeing furry thing sped across his feet, running....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDenham looked up. And Evelyn was staring now. She was staring in the\r\ndirection of the Golden City. And now what was almost a wave of\r\nanimals, all wild and all fleeing, swept across the field of vision of\r\nthe dimensoscope. There were gazelles, it seemed--slender-limbed,\r\ngraceful animals, at any rate--and there were tiny hoofed things which\r\nmight have been eohippi, and then a monstrous armadillo clanked and\r\nrattled past....\r\n\r\nTommy swung the dimensoscope. He gasped. All the animal world was in\r\nflight. The insects had taken to wing. Flying creatures were soaring\r\nupward and streaking through the clear blue sky, and all in the one\r\ndirection. And then out of the morass came monstrous shapes;\r\nmisshapen, unbelievable reptilian shapes, which fled bellowing\r\nthunderously for the tree-fern forest. They were gigantic, those\r\nthings from the morass. They were hideous. They were things out of\r\nnightmares, made into flabby flesh. There were lizards and what might\r\nhave been gigantic frogs, save that frogs possess no tails. And there\r\nwere long and snaky necks terminating in infinitesimal heads, and vast\r\npalpitating bodies following those impossible small brain-cases, and\r\nlong tapering tails that thrashed mightily as the ghastly things fled\r\nbellowing....\r\n\r\nAnd the cause of the mad panic was a slowly moving white curtain of\r\nmist. It was flowing over the marsh, moving with apparent\r\ndeliberation, but, as Tommy saw, actually very swiftly. It shimmered\r\nand quivered and moved onward steadily. Its upper surface gleamed with\r\nelusive prismatic colors. It had blotted out the horizon and the\r\nGolden City, and it came onward....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDenham made frantic, despairing gestures toward the dimensoscope. The\r\nthing was coming too fast. There was no time to write. Denham held\r\nhigh the cord that trailed from the message-bearing missile. He\r\ngesticulated frantically, and raced to the gutted steel globe and\r\nheaved mightily upon it and swung it about so that Tommy saw a great\r\nsteel ring set in its side, which had been hidden before. He made more\r\ngestures, urgently, and motioned Evelyn inside.\r\n\r\nTommy struck at his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"It's poison gas,\" he muttered. \"Revenge for the smashed-up\r\nvehicle.... They knew it by an automatic radio signal, maybe. This is\r\ntheir way of wiping out the Ragged Men.... Poison gas.... It'll kill\r\nDenham and Evelyn.... He wants me to do something....\"\r\n\r\nHe drew back, staring, straining every nerve to think.... And somehow\r\nhis eyes were drawn to the back of the laboratory and he saw Smithers\r\nteetering on his feet, with his hands clasped queerly to his body, and\r\na strange man standing in the door of the laboratory with an automatic\r\npistol in his hand. The automatic had a silencer on it, and its\r\nclicking had been drowned out, anyhow, by the roaring of the crude-oil\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nThe man was small and dark and natty. His lips were drawn back in a\r\npeculiar mirthless grin as Smithers teetered stupidly back and forth\r\nand then fell....\r\n\r\nThe explosion of Tommy's own revolver astounded him as much as it did\r\nJacaro's gunman. He did not ever remember drawing it or aiming. The\r\nnatty little gunman was blotted out by a spouting mass of white\r\nsmoke--and suddenly Tommy knew what it was that Denham wanted him to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was rope in a loose and untidy coil beneath a work bench. Tommy\r\nsprang to it in a queer, nightmarish activity. He knew what was\r\nhappening, of course. Von Holtz had seen the magnetic catapult at\r\nwork. That couldn't be destroyed or its workings hidden like the ring\r\ncatapult of Denham's design. He'd gone out to call in Jacaro's men.\r\nAnd they'd shot down Smithers as a cold-blooded preliminary to the\r\nseizure of the instrument Jacaro wanted.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to defend the laboratory. But Tommy could not spare\r\nthe time. That white mist was moving upon Evelyn and her father, in\r\nthat other world. It was death, as the terror of the wild things\r\ndemonstrated. They had to be helped....\r\n\r\nHe knotted the rope to the end of the cord that vanished curiously\r\nsomewhere among the useless mass of rings. He tugged at the cord--and\r\nit was tugged in return. Denham, in another world, had felt his signal\r\nand had replied to it....\r\n\r\nA window smashed suddenly and a bullet missed Tommy's neck by inches.\r\nHe fired at that window, and absorbedly guided the knot of the rope\r\npast its vanishing point. The knot ceased to exist and the rope crept\r\nonward--and suddenly moved more and more swiftly to a place where\r\nabruptly it was not. For the length of half an inch, the rope hurt the\r\neyes that looked at it. Beyond that it was not possible to see it at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nTommy leaped up. He plunged ahead of two separate spurts of shots from\r\ntwo separate windows. The shots pierced the place where he had been.\r\nHe was racing for the crude-oil engine. There was a chain wound upon a\r\ndrum, there, and a clutch attached the drum to the engine.\r\n\r\nHe stopped and seized the repeating shotgun Smithers had brought as\r\nhis own weapon against Jacaro's gangsters. He sent four loads of\r\nbuckshot at the windows of the laboratory. A man yelled.\r\n\r\nAnd Tommy had dropped the gun to knot the rope to the chain,\r\ndesperately, fiercely, in a terrible haste.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe chain began to pay out to that peculiar vanishing point which was\r\nhere an entry-way to another world--perhaps another universe.\r\n\r\nA bullet nicked his ribs. He picked up the gun and fired it nearly at\r\nrandom. He saw Smithers moving feebly, and Tommy had a vast compassion\r\nfor Smithers, but-- He shuddered suddenly. Something had struck him a\r\nheavy blow in the shoulder. And something else battered at his leg.\r\nThere was no sound that could be heard above the thunder of the\r\ncrude-oil motor, but Tommy, was queerly aware of buzzing things flying\r\nabout him, and of something very warm flowing down his body and down\r\nhis leg. And he felt very dizzy and weak and extremely tired.... He\r\ncould not see clearly, either.\r\n\r\nBut he had to wait until Denham had the chain fast to the globe. That\r\nwas the way he had intended to come back, of course. The ring was in\r\nthe globe, and this chain was in the laboratory to haul the globe back\r\nfrom wherever it had been sent. And Von Holtz had disconnected it\r\nbefore sending away the globe with Denham in it. If the chain remained\r\nunbroken, of course it could be hauled in, as it would turn all\r\nnecessary angles and force the globe to follow those angles, whatever\r\nthey might be....\r\n\r\nTommy was on his hands and knees, and men were saying savagely:\r\n\r\n\"Where's that thing, hey? Where's th' thing Jacaro wants?\"\r\n\r\nHe wanted to tell them that they should say if the chain had stopped\r\nmoving to a place where it ceased to exist, so that he could throw a\r\nclutch and bring Denham and his daughter back from the place where Von\r\nHoltz had marooned them when he wanted to steal Denham's secret. Tommy\r\nwanted to explain that. But the floor struck him in the face, and\r\nsomething said to him:\r\n\r\n\"They've shot you.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it did not seem to matter, somehow, and he lay very still until he\r\nfelt himself strangling, and he was breathing in strong ammonia which\r\nmade his eyes smart and his tired lungs gasp.\r\n\r\nThen he saw flames, and heard a motor car roaring away from close by\r\nthe laboratory.\r\n\r\n\"They've stolen the catapult and set fire to the place,\" he remembered\r\ndizzily, \"and now they're skipping out....\"\r\n\r\nEven that did not seem to matter. But then he heard the chain clank,\r\nnext to him on the floor. The white mist! Denham and Evelyn waiting\r\nfor the white mist to reach them, and Denham jerking desperately on\r\nthe chain to signal that he was ready....\r\n\r\nThe flames had released ammonia from the metal Von Holtz had made.\r\nThat had roused Tommy. But it did not give him strength. It is\r\nimpossible to say where Tommy's strength came from, when somehow he\r\ncrawled to the clutch lever, with the engine roaring steadily above\r\nhim, and got one hand on the lever, and edged himself up, and up, and\r\nup, until he could swing his whole weight on that lever. That instant\r\nof dangling hurt excruciatingly, too, and Tommy saw only that the drum\r\nbegan to revolve swiftly, winding the chain upon it, before his grip\r\ngave way.\r\n\r\nAnd the chain came winding in and in from nowhere, and the tall\r\nlaboratory filled more and more thickly with smoke, and lurid flames\r\nappeared somewhere, and a rushing sound began to be audible as the\r\nfire roared upward to the inflammable roof, and the engine ran\r\nthunderously....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, there was a shape in the middle of the laboratory\r\nfloor. A huge globular shape which it hurt the eyes to look upon. It\r\nbecame visible out of nowhere as if evoked by magic amid the flames of\r\nhell. But it came, and was solid and substantial, and it slid along\r\nthe floor upon small wheels until it wound up with a crash against the\r\nwinding drum, and the chain shrieked as it tightened unbearably--and\r\nthe engine choked and died.\r\n\r\nThen a door opened in the monstrous globe. Two figures leaped out,\r\naghast. Two ragged, tattered, strangely-armed figures, who cried out\r\nto each other and started for the door. But the girl stumbled over\r\nTommy and called, choking, to her father. Groping toward her, he found\r\nSmithers. And then Tommy smiled drowsily to himself as soft arms\r\ntugged bravely at him, and a slender, glorious figure staggered with\r\nhim to fresh air.\r\n\r\n\"It's Von Holtz,\" snapped Denham, and coughed as he fought his way to\r\nthe open. \"I'll blast him to hell with these things we brought\r\nback....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat was the last thing Tommy knew until he woke up in bed with a\r\nfeeling of many bandages and an impression that his lungs hurt.\r\n\r\nDenham seemed to have heard him move. He looked in the door.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Reames. You're all right now.\"\r\n\r\nTommy regarded him curiously until he realized. Denham was shaved and\r\nfully clothed. That was the strangeness about him. Tommy had been\r\nwatching him for many days as his clothing swiftly deteriorated and\r\nhis beard grew.\r\n\r\n\"You are, too, I see,\" he said weakly. \"I'm damned glad.\" Then he felt\r\nfoolish, and querulous, and as if he should make some apology, and\r\ninstead said, \"But five dimensions does seem extreme. Three is enough\r\nfor ordinary use, and four is luxurious. Five seems to be going a bit\r\ntoo far.\"\r\n\r\nDenham blinked, and then grinned suddenly. Tommy had admired the man\r\nwho could face so extraordinary a situation with such dogged courage,\r\nand now he found, suddenly, that he liked Denham.\r\n\r\n\"Not too far,\" said Denham grimly. \"Look!\" He held up one of the\r\nweapons Tommy had seen in that other world, one of the golden-colored\r\ntruncheons. \"I brought this back. The same metal they built that wagon\r\nof theirs with. All their weapons. Most of their tools--as I know.\r\nIt's gold, man! They use gold in that world as we use steel here.\r\nThat's why Jacaro was ready to kill to get the secret of getting\r\nthere. Von Holtz enlisted him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you know--\" began Tommy weakly.\r\n\r\n\"Smithers,\" said Denham. \"We dragged both of you out before the lab\r\nwent-up in smoke. He's going to be all right, too. Evelyn's nursing\r\nboth of you. She wants to talk to you, but I want to say this first:\r\nYou did a damned fine thing, Reames! The only man who could have saved\r\nus, and you just about killed yourself doing it. Smithers saw you\r\nswing that clutch lever with three bullets in your body. And you're a\r\nscientist, too. You're my partner, Reames, in what we do in the fifth\r\ndimension.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTommy blinked. \"But five dimensions does seem extreme....\"\r\n\r\n\"We are the Interdimensional Trading Company,\" said Denham, smiling.\r\n\"Somehow, I think we'll find something in this world we can trade for\r\nthe gold in that. And we've got to get there, Reames, because Jacaro\r\nwill surely try to make use of that catapult principle you worked out.\r\nHe'll raise the devil; and I think the people of that Golden City\r\nwould be worth knowing. No, we're partners. Sooner or later, you'll\r\nknow how I feel about what you've done. I'm going to bring Evelyn in\r\nhere now.\"\r\n\r\nHe vanished. An instant later Tommy heard a voice--a girl's voice. His\r\nheart began to pound. Denham came back into the room and with him was\r\nEvelyn. She smiled warmly upon Tommy, though as his eyes fell blankly\r\nupon the smart sport clothes she was again wearing, she flushed.\r\n\r\n\"My daughter Evelyn,\" said Denham. \"She wants to thank you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Tommy felt a warm soft hand pressing his, and he looked deep into\r\nthe eyes of the girl he had never before spoken to, but for whom he\r\nhad risked his life, and whom he knew he would love forever. There\r\nwere a thousand things crowding to his lips for utterance. He had\r\nwatched Evelyn, and he loved her--\r\n\r\n\"H-how do you do?\" said Tommy, lamely. \"I'm--awfully glad to meet\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nBut before he was well he learned to talk more sensibly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _--And the ships, at that touch, fell helplessly down\r\nfrom the heights._]\r\n\r\nThe Pirate Planet\r\n\r\nPART THREE OF A FOUR-PART NOVEL\r\n\r\n_By Charles W. Diffin_\r\n\r\n    Two fighting Yankees--war-torn Earth's sole representatives on\r\n    Venus--set out to spike the greatest gun of all time.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HAS GONE BEFORE\r\n\r\nThe attack comes without warning; its reason is unknown. But Venus is\r\napproaching the earth, and flashes from the planet are followed by\r\nterrific explosions that wreak havoc throughout the world. Lieutenant\r\nMcGuire and Captain Blake of the U. S. Army Air Service see a great\r\nship fly in from space. Blake attacks it with the 91st Squadron in\r\nsupport, and Blake alone survives. McGuire and Professor Sykes, an\r\nastronomer of Mount Lawson, are captured.\r\n\r\nThe bombardment ceases as Venus passes on, and the people of Earth\r\nsink into hopeless despondency. Less than a year and a half and the\r\nplanet will return, and then--the end! The armament of Earth is futile\r\nagainst an enemy who has conquered space. Blake hopes that science\r\nmight provide a means; might show our fighters how to go out into\r\nspace and throttle the attack at its source. But the hope is blasted,\r\nuntil a radio from McGuire supplies a lead.\r\n\r\nMcGuire is on Venus. He and Sykes land on that distant planet,\r\ncaptives of a barbarous people. They are taken before Torg, the\r\nemperor, and his council, and they learn that these red, man-shaped\r\nbeasts intend to conquer the earth. Spawning in millions, they are\r\ncrowded, and Earth is to be their colony.\r\n\r\nImprisoned on a distant island, the two captives are drugged and\r\nhypnotized before a machine which throws their thoughts upon a screen.\r\nInvoluntary traitors, they disclose the secrets of Earth and its\r\nhelplessness; then attempt to escape and end their lives rather than\r\nbe forced to further betrayal of their own people.\r\n\r\nMcGuire finds a radio station and sends a message back to Earth. He\r\nimplores Blake to find a man named Winslow, for Winslow has invented a\r\nspace ship and claims to have reached the moon.\r\n\r\nNo time for further sending--McGuire does not even know if his message\r\nhas been received--but they reach the ocean where death offers them\r\nrelease. A force of their captors attacking on land, they throw\r\nthemselves from a cliff, then swim out to drown beyond reach in the\r\nocean. An enemy ship sweeps above them: its gas cloud threatens not\r\nthe death they desire but unconsciousness and capture. \"God help us,\"\r\nsays Sykes; \"we can't even die!\"\r\n\r\nThey sink, only to be buoyed up by a huge metal shape. A metal\r\nprojector raises from the ocean, bears upon the enemy ship and sends\r\nit, a mass of flame and molten metal, into the sea. And friendly\r\nvoices are in McGuire's ears as careful hands lift the two men and\r\ncarry them within the craft that has saved them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nLieutenant McGuire had tried to die. He and Professor Sykes had\r\nwelcomed death with open arms, and death had been thwarted by their\r\nenemies who wanted them alive--wanted to draw their knowledge from\r\nthem as a vampire bat might seek to feast. And, when even death was\r\ndenied them, help had come.\r\n\r\nThe enemy ship had gone crashing to destruction where its melting\r\nmetal made hissing clouds of steam as it buried itself in the ocean.\r\nAnd this craft that had saved them--Lieutenant McGuire had never been\r\non a submarine, but he knew it could be only that that held him now\r\nand carried him somewhere at tremendous speed.\r\n\r\nThis was miracle enough! But to see, with eyes which could not be\r\ndeceiving him, a vision of men, human, white of face--men like\r\nhimself--bending and working over Sykes' unconscious body--that could\r\nnot be immediately grasped.\r\n\r\nTheir faces, unlike the bleached-blood horrors he had seen, were aglow\r\nwith the flush of health. They were tall, slenderly built, graceful in\r\ntheir quick motions as they worked to revive the unconscious man. One\r\nstopped, as he passed, to lay a cool hand on McGuire's forehead, and\r\nthe eyes that looked down seemed filled with the blessed quality of\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nThey were human--his own kind!--and McGuire was unable to take in at\r\nfirst the full wonder of it.\r\n\r\nDid the tall man speak? His lips did not move, yet McGuire heard the\r\nwords as in some inner ear.\r\n\r\n\"We were awaiting you, friend Mack Guire.\" The voice was musical,\r\nthrilling, and yet the listening man could not have sworn that he\r\nheard a voice at all. It was as if a thought were placed within his\r\nmind by the one beside him.\r\n\r\nThe one who had paused hurried on to aid the others, and McGuire let\r\nhis gaze wander.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe porthole beside him showed dimly a pale green light; they were\r\nsubmerged, and the hissing rush of water told him that they were\r\ntravelling fast. There was a door in the farther wall; beyond was a\r\nroom of gleaming lights that reflected from myriads of shining levers\r\nand dials. A control room. A figure moved as McGuire watched, to press\r\non a lever where a red light was steadily increasing in brightness. He\r\nconsulted strange instruments before him, touched a metal button here\r\nand there, then opened a switch, and the rippling hiss of waters\r\noutside their craft softened to a gentler note.\r\n\r\nThe tall one was beside him again.\r\n\r\n\"Your friend will live,\" he told him in that wordless tongue, \"and we\r\nare almost arrived. The invisible arms of our anchorage have us now\r\nand will draw us safely to rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe kindly tone was music in McGuire's ears, and he smiled in reply.\r\n\"Friends!\" he thought. \"We are among friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are most welcome,\" the other assured him, \"and, yes, you are\r\ntruly among friends.\" But the lieutenant glanced upward in wonder, for\r\nhe knew that he had uttered no spoken word.\r\n\r\nTheir ship turned and changed its course beneath them, then came\r\nfinally to rest with a slight rocking motion as if cushioned on\r\npowerful springs. Sykes was being assisted to his feet as the tall man\r\nreached for McGuire's hand and helped him to rise.\r\n\r\nThe two men of Earth stood for a long minute while they stared\r\nunbelievingly into each other's eyes. Their wonder and amazement found\r\nno words for expression but must have been apparent to the one beside\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"You will understand,\" he told them. \"Do not question this reality\r\neven to yourselves. You are safe!... Come.\" And he led the way through\r\nan opening doorway to a wet deck outside. Beyond this was a wharf of\r\ncarved stone, and the men followed where steps were inset to allow\r\nthem to ascend.\r\n\r\nAgain McGuire could not know if he heard a tumult of sound or sensed\r\nit in some deeper way. The air about them was aglow with soft light,\r\nand it echoed in his ears with music unmistakably real--beautiful\r\nmusic!--exhilarating! But the clamor of welcoming voices, like the\r\nwords from their tall companion, came soundlessly to him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were people, throngs of them, waiting. Tall like the others,\r\ngarbed, like those horrible beings of a past that seemed distant and\r\nremote, in loose garments of radiant colors. And everywhere were\r\nwelcoming smiles and warm and friendly glances.\r\n\r\nMcGuire let his dazed eyes roam around to find the sculptured walls of\r\na huge room like a tremendous cave. The soft glow of light was\r\neverywhere, and it brought out the beauty of flowing lines and\r\ndelicate colors in statuary and bas-relief that adorned the walls.\r\nBehind him the water made a dark pool, and from it projected the upper\r\nworks of their strange craft.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were hungry for these new sights, but he turned with Sykes to\r\nfollow their guide through the colorful crowd that parted to let them\r\nthrough. They passed under a carved archway and found themselves in\r\nanother and greater room.\r\n\r\nBut was it a room? McGuire marveled at its tremendous size. His eyes\r\ntook in the smooth green of a grassy lawn, the flowers and plants, and\r\nthen they followed where the hand of Sykes was pointing. The\r\nastronomer gripped McGuire's arm in a numbing clutch; his other hand\r\nwas raised above.\r\n\r\n\"The stars,\" he said. \"The clouds are gone; it is night!\"\r\n\r\nAnd where he pointed was a vault of black velvet. Deep hues of blue\r\nseemed blended with it, and far in its depths were the old familiar\r\nstar-groups of the skies. \"Ah!\" the scientist breathed, \"the\r\nbeautiful, friendly stars!\"\r\n\r\nTheir guide waited; then, \"Come,\" he urged gently, and led them toward\r\na lake whose unruffled glassy surface mirrored the stars above. Beside\r\nit a man was waiting to receive them.\r\n\r\nMcGuire had to force his eyes away from the unreal beauty of opal\r\nwalls like the fairy structures they had seen. There was color\r\neverywhere that blended and fused to make glorious harmony that was\r\npure joy to the eyes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe man who waited was young. He stood erect, his face like that of a\r\nGrecian statue, and his robe was blazing with the flash of jewels.\r\nBeside him was a girl, tall and slender, and sweetly serious of face.\r\nLike the man, her garments were lovely with jeweled iridescence, and\r\nnow McGuire saw that the throng within the vast space was similarly\r\napparelled.\r\n\r\nThe tall man raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome!\" he said, and McGuire realized with a start that the words\r\nwere spoken aloud. \"You are most welcome, my friends, among the people\r\nof that world you call Venus.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Sykes was still weak from his ordeal; he wavered perceptibly\r\nwhere he stood, and the man before them them turned to give an order.\r\nThere were chairs that came like magic; bright robes covered them; and\r\nthe men were seated while the man and girl also took seats beside them\r\nas those who prepare for an intimate talk with friends.\r\n\r\nLieutenant McGuire found his voice at last. \"Who are you?\" he asked in\r\nwondering tones. \"What does it mean? We were lost--and you saved us.\r\nBut you--you are not like the others.\" And he repeated, \"What does it\r\nmean?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the other with a slight smile, \"we truly are not like those\r\nothers. They are not men such as you and I. They are something less\r\nthan human: animals--vermin!--from whom God, in His wisdom, has seen\r\nfit to withhold the virtues that raise men higher than the beasts.\"\r\n\r\nHis face hardened as he spoke and for a moment the eyes were stern,\r\nbut he smiled again as he continued.\r\n\r\n\"And we,\" he said, \"you ask who we are. We are the people of Venus. I\r\nam Djorn, ruler, in name, of all. 'In name' I say, for we rule here by\r\ncommon reason; I am only selected to serve. And this is my sister,\r\nAlthora. The name, with us, means 'radiant light.'\" He turned to\r\nexchange smiles with the girl at his side. \"We think her well named,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"The others,\"--he waved toward the throng that clustered about--\"you\r\nwill learn to know in time.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Sykes felt the need of introductions.\r\n\r\n\"This is Lieutenant--\" he began, but the other interrupted with an\r\nupraised hand.\r\n\r\n\"Mack Guire,\" he supplied; \"and you are Professor Sykes.... Oh, we\r\nknow you!\" he laughed; \"we have been watching you since your arrival;\r\nwe have been waiting to help you.\"\r\n\r\nThe professor was open-mouthed.\r\n\r\n\"Your thoughts,\" explained the other, \"are as a printed page. We have\r\nbeen with you by mental contact at all times. We could hear, but, at\r\nthat distance, and--pardon me!--with your limited receptivity, we\r\ncould not communicate.\r\n\r\n\"Do not resent our intrusion,\" he added; \"we listened only for our own\r\ngood, and we shall show you how to insulate your thoughts. We do not\r\npry.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant McGuire waved all that aside. \"You saved us from them,\" he\r\nsaid; \"that's the answer. But--what does it mean? Those others are in\r\ncontrol; they are attacking our Earth, the world where we lived. Why\r\ndo you permit--?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the other's face was set in sterner lines.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, and his voice was full of unspoken regret, \"they do\r\nrule this world; they _have_ attacked your Earth; they intend much\r\nmore, and I fear they must be successful. Listen. Your wonderment is\r\nnatural, and I shall explain.\r\n\r\n\"We are the people of Venus. Some centuries ago we ruled this world.\r\nNow you find us a handful only, living like moles in this underworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"Underworld?\" protested Professor Sykes. He pointed above to the\r\nfamiliar constellations. \"Where are the clouds?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe girl, Althora, leaned forward now. \"It will please my brother,\"\r\nshe said in a soft voice, \"that you thought it real. He has had\r\npleasure in creating that--a replica of the skies we used to know\r\nbefore the coming of the clouds.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Sykes was bewildered. \"That sky--the stars--they are not\r\nreal?\" he asked incredulously. \"But the grass--the flowers--\"\r\n\r\nHer laugh rippled like music. \"Oh, they are real,\" she told him, and\r\nher brother gave added explanation.\r\n\r\n\"The lights,\" he said: \"we supply the actinic rays that the clouds cut\r\noff above. We have sunlight here, made by our own hands; that is why\r\nwe are as we are and not like the red ones with their bleached skins.\r\nWe had our lights everywhere through the world when we lived above,\r\nbut those red beasts are ignorant; they do not know how to operate\r\nthem; they do not know that they live in darkness even in the light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we are below ground?\" asked the flyer. \"You live here?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all we have now. At that time of which I tell, it was the red\r\nones who lived out of sight; they were a race of rodents in human\r\nform. They lived in the subterranean caves with which this planet is\r\npierced. We could have exterminated them at any time, but, in our\r\nignorance, we permitted them to live, for we, of Venus--I use your\r\nname for the planet--do not willingly take life.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have no such compunctions!\" Professor Sykes' voice was harsh; he\r\nwas remembering the sacrifice to the hungry plants.\r\n\r\nA flash as of pain crossed the sensitive features of the girl, and the\r\nman beside her seemed speaking to her in soundless words.\r\n\r\n\"Your mind-picture was not pleasant,\" he told the scientist; then\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"Remember, we were upon the world, and these others were within it.\r\nThere came a comet. Oh, our astronomers plotted its course; they told\r\nus we were safe. But at the last some unknown influence diverted it;\r\nits gaseous projection swept our world with flame. Only an instant;\r\nbut when it had passed there was left only death....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was lost in recollection for a time; the girl beside him reached\r\nover to touch his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Those within--the red ones--escaped,\" he went on. \"They poured forth\r\nwhen they found that catastrophe had overwhelmed us. And we, the\r\nhandful that were left, were forced to take shelter here. We have\r\nlived here since, waiting for the day when the Master of Destinies\r\nshall give us freedom and a world in which to live.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak,\" suggested the scientist, \"as if this had happened to you.\r\nSurely you refer to your ancestors; you are the descendants of those\r\nwho were saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are the people,\" said the other. \"We lived then; we live now; we\r\nshall live for a future of endless years.\r\n\r\n\"Have you not searched for the means to control the life\r\nprinciple--you people of Earth?\" he asked. \"We have it here. You\r\nsee\"--and he waved a hand toward the standing throng--\"we are young to\r\nyour eyes and the others who greeted you were the same.\"\r\n\r\nMcGuire and the scientist exchanged glances of corroboration.\r\n\r\n\"But your age,\" asked Sykes, \"measured in years?\"\r\n\r\n\"We hardly measure life in years.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Sykes nodded slowly; his mind found difficulty in accepting\r\nso astounding a fact. \"But our language?\" he queried. \"How is it that\r\nyou can speak our tongue?\"\r\n\r\nThe tall man smiled and leaned forward to place a hand on a knee of\r\neach of the men beside him. \"Why not,\" he asked, \"when there doubtless\r\nis relationship between us.\r\n\r\n\"You called the continent Atlantis. Perhaps its very existence is but\r\na fable now: it has been many centuries since we have had instruments\r\nto record thought force from Earth, and we have lost touch. But, my\r\nfriends, even then we of Venus had conquered space, and it was we who\r\nvisited Atlantis to find a race more nearly like ourselves than were\r\nthe barbarians who held the other parts of Earth.\r\n\r\n\"I was there, but I returned. There were some who stayed and they were\r\nlost with the others in the terrible cataclysm that sank a whole\r\ncontinent beneath the waters. But some, we have believed, escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why have you not been back?\" the flyer asked. \"You could have helped\r\nus so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was then that our own destruction came upon us. The same comet,\r\nperhaps, may have caused a change of stresses in your Earth and sunk\r\nthe lost Atlantis. Ah! That was a beautiful land, but we have never\r\nseen it since. We have been--here.\r\n\r\n\"But you will understand, now,\" he added, \"that, with our insight into\r\nyour minds, we have little difficulty in mastering your language.\"\r\n\r\nThis talk of science and incredible history left Lieutenant McGuire\r\ncold. His mind could not wander long from its greatest concern.\r\n\r\n\"But the earth!\" he exclaimed. \"What about the earth? This attack!\r\nThose devils mean real mischief!\"\r\n\r\n\"More than you know; more than you can realize, friend Mack Guire!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" demanded the flyer. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have your countries not reached out for other countries when land was\r\nneeded?\" asked the man, Djorn. \"Land--land! Space in which to\r\nbreed--that is the reason for the invasion.\r\n\r\n\"This world has no such continents as yours. Here the globe is covered\r\nby the oceans; we have perhaps one hundredth of the land areas of your\r\nEarth And the red ones breed like flies. Life means nothing to them;\r\nthey die like flies, too. But they need more room; they intend to find\r\nit on your world.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A strange race,\" mused Professor Sykes. \"They puzzled me. But--'less\r\nthan human,' I think you said. Then how about their ships? How could\r\nthey invent them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ours--all ours! They found a world ready and waiting for them.\r\nThrough the centuries they have learned to master some few of our\r\ninventions. The ships!--the ethereal vibrations! Oh, they have been\r\ncleverer than we dreamed possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how can we stop them?\" demanded McGuire. \"We must. You have the\r\nsubmarines--\"\r\n\r\n\"One only,\" the other interrupted. \"We saved that, and we brought some\r\nmachinery. We have made this place habitable; we have not been idle.\r\nBut there are limitations.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your ray that you projected--it brought down their ship!\"\r\n\r\n\"We were protecting you, and we protect ourselves; that is enough.\r\nThere is One will deliver us in His own good time; we may not go forth\r\nand slaughter.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a note of resignation and patience in the voice that filled\r\nMcGuire with hopeless forebodings. Plainly this was not an aggressive\r\nrace. They had evolved beyond the stage of wanton slaughter, and, even\r\nnow, they waited patiently for the day when some greater force should\r\ncome to their aid.\r\n\r\nThe man beside them spoke quickly. \"One moment--you will pardon\r\nme--someone is calling--\" He listened intently to some soundless call,\r\nand he sent a silent message in reply.\r\n\r\n\"I have instructed them,\" he said. \"Come and you shall see how\r\nimpregnable is our position. The red ones have resented our\r\ndestruction of their ship.\"\r\n\r\nThe face of the girl, Althora, was perturbed. \"More killings?\" she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Only as they force themselves to their own death,\" her brother told\r\nher. \"Be not disturbed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe throng in the vast space drew apart as the figure of their leader\r\nstrode quickly through with the two men following close. There were\r\nmany rooms and passages; the men had glimpses of living quarters, of\r\nplaces where machinery made soft whirring sounds; more sights than\r\ntheir eyes could see or their minds comprehend. They came at last to\r\nan open chamber.\r\n\r\nThe men looked up to see above them a tremendous inverted-cone, and\r\nthere was the gold of cloudland glowing through an opening at the top.\r\nIt was the inside of a volcano where they stood, and McGuire\r\nremembered the island and its volcanic peak where the ship had swerved\r\naside. He felt that he knew now where they were.\r\n\r\nAbove them, a flash of light marked the passage of a ship over the\r\ncrater's mouth, and he realized that the ships of the reds were not\r\navoiding the island now. Did it mean an attack? And how could these\r\nnew friends meet it?\r\n\r\nBefore them on the level volcanic floor were great machines that came\r\nsuddenly to life, and their roar rose to a thunder of violence, while,\r\nin the center, a cluster of electric sparks like whirling stars formed\r\na cloud of blue fire. It grew, and its hissing, crackling length\r\nreached upward to a fine-drawn point that touched the opening above.\r\n\r\n\"Follow!\" commanded their leader and went rapidly before them where a\r\npassage wound and twisted to bring them at last to the light of day.\r\n\r\nThe flame of the golden clouds was above them in the midday sky, and\r\nbeneath it were scores of ships that swept in formations through the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\"Attacking?\" asked the lieutenant with ill-concealed excitement.\r\n\r\n\"I fear so. They tried to gas us some centuries ago; it may be they\r\nhave forgotten what we taught them then.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne squadron came downward and swept with inconceivable speed over a\r\nportion of the island that stretched below. The men were a short\r\ndistance up on the mountain's side, and the scene that lay before them\r\nwas crystal clear. There were billowing clouds of gas that spread over\r\nthe land where the ships had passed. Other ships followed; they would\r\nblanket the island in gas.\r\n\r\nThe man beside them gave a sigh of regret. \"They have struck the first\r\nblow,\" he said. He stood silent with half-closed eyes; then: \"I have\r\nordered resistance.\" And there was genuine sorrow and regret in his\r\neyes as he looked toward the mountain top.\r\n\r\nMcGuire's eyes followed the other's gaze to find nothing at first save\r\nthe volcanic peak in hard outline upon the background of gold; then\r\nonly a shimmer as of heat about the lofty cone. The air above him\r\nquivered, formed to ripples that spread in great circles where the\r\nenemy ships were flashing away.\r\n\r\nSwifter than swift aircraft, with a speed that shattered space, they\r\nreached out and touched--and the ships, at that touch, fell helplessly\r\ndown from the heights. They turned awkwardly as they fell or dropped\r\nlike huge pointed projectiles. And the waters below took them silently\r\nand buried in their depths all trace of what an instant sooner had\r\nbeen an argosy of the air.\r\n\r\nThe ripples ceased, again the air was clear and untroubled, but\r\nbeneath the golden clouds was no single sign of life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe flyer's breathless suspense ended in an explosive gasp. \"What a\r\nwashout!\" he exclaimed, and again he thought only of this as a weapon\r\nto be used for his own ends. \"Can we use that on their fleets?\" he\r\nasked. \"Why, man--they will never conquer the earth; they will never\r\neven make a start.\"\r\n\r\nThe tall figure of Djorn turned and looked at him. \"The lust to kill!\"\r\nhe said sadly. \"You still have it--though you are fighting for your\r\nown, which is some excuse.\r\n\r\n\"No, this will not destroy their fleets, for their fleets will not\r\ncome here to be destroyed. It will be many centuries before ever again\r\nthe aircraft of the reds dare venture near.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will build another one and take it where they are--\" The voice of\r\nthe fighting man was vibrant with sudden hope.\r\n\r\n\"We were two hundred years building and perfecting this,\" the other\r\ntold him. \"Can you wait that long?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Lieutenant McGuire, as he followed dejectedly behind the leader,\r\nheard nothing of Professor Sykes' eager questions as to how this\r\nmiracle was done.\r\n\r\n\"Can you wait that long?\" this man, Djorn, had asked. And the flyer\r\nsaw plainly the answer that spelled death and destruction to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nThe mountains of Nevada are not noted for their safe and easy landing\r\nplaces. But the motor of the plane that Captain Blake was piloting\r\nroared smoothly in the cool air while the man's eyes went searching,\r\nsearching, for something, and he hardly knew what that something might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nHe went over again, as he had done a score of times, the remarks of\r\nLieutenant McGuire. Mac had laughed that day when he told Blake of his\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\"I was flying that transport,\" he had said, \"and, boy! when one motor\r\nbegan to throw oil I knew I was out of luck. Nothing but rocky peaks\r\nand valleys full of trees as thick and as pointed as a porcupine's\r\nquills. Flying pretty high to maintain altitude with one motor out, so\r\nI just naturally _had_ to find a place to set her down. I found it,\r\ntoo, though it seemed too good to be true off in that wilderness.\r\n\r\n\"A fine level spot, all smooth rock, except for a few clumps of grass,\r\nand just bumpy enough to make the landing interesting. But, say,\r\nCaptain! I almost cracked up at that, I was so darn busy staring at\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\n\"Off in some trees was a dirigible--Sure; go ahead and laugh; I didn't\r\nbelieve it either, and I was looking at it. But there had been a whale\r\nof a storm through there the day before, and it had knocked over some\r\ntrees that had been screening the thing, and there it was!\r\n\r\n\"Well, I came to in time to pull up her nose and miss a rock or two,\r\nand then I started pronto for that valley of trees and the thing that\r\nwas buried among them.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Blake recalled the conversation word for word, though he had\r\ntreated it jokingly at the time. McGuire had found the ship and a\r\nman--a half-crazed nut, so it seemed--living there all alone. And he\r\nwasn't a bit keen about Mac's learning of the ship. But leave it to\r\nMac to get the facts--or what the old bird claimed were facts.\r\n\r\nThere was the body of a youngster there, a man of about Mac's age. He\r\nhad fallen and been killed the day before, and the old man was half\r\ncrazy with grief. Mac had dug a grave and helped bury the body, and\r\nafter that the old fellow's story had come out.\r\n\r\nHe had been to the moon, he said. And this was a space ship. Wouldn't\r\ntell how it operated, and shut up like a clam when Mac asked if he had\r\ngone alone. The young chap had gone with him, it seemed, and the man\r\nwouldn't talk--just sat and stared out at the yellow mound where the\r\nyoungster was buried.\r\n\r\nMac had told Blake how he argued with the man to prove up on his\r\nclaims and make a fortune for himself. But no--fortunes didn't\r\ninterest him. And there were some this-and-that and be-damned-to-'em\r\npeople who would never get _this_ invention--the dirty, thieving rats!\r\n\r\nAnd Mac, while he laughed, had seemed half to believe it. Said the old\r\ncuss was so sincere, and he had nothing to sell. And--there was the\r\nship! It never got there without being flown in, that was a cinch. And\r\nthere wasn't a propellor on it nor a place for one--just open ports\r\nwhere a blast came out, or so the inventor said.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blake swung his ship on another slanting line and continued to\r\ncomb the country for such marks as McGuire had seen. And one moment he\r\ntold himself he was a fool to be on any such hunt, while the next\r\nthought would remind him that Mac had believed. And Mac had a level\r\nhead, and he had radioed from Venus!\r\n\r\nThere was the thing that made anything seem possible. Mac had got a\r\nmessage through, across that space, and the enemy had ships that could\r\ndo it. Why not this one?\r\n\r\nAnd always his eyes were searching, searching, for a level rocky\r\nexpanse and a tree-filled valley beyond, with something, it might be,\r\nshining there, unless the inventor had camouflaged it more carefully\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was later on the same day when Captain Blake's blocky figure\r\nclimbed over the side of the cockpit. Tired? Yes! But who could think\r\nof cramped limbs and weary muscles when his plane was resting on a\r\nbroad, level expanse of rock in the high Sierras and a sharp-cut\r\nvalley showed thick with pines beyond. He could see the corner only of\r\na rough log shack that protruded.\r\n\r\nBlake scrambled over a natural rampart of broken stone and went\r\nswiftly toward the cabin. But he stopped abruptly at the sound of a\r\nharsh voice.\r\n\r\n\"Stop where you are,\" the voice ordered, \"and stick up your hands!\r\nThen turn around and get back as fast as you can to that plane of\r\nyours.\" There was a glint of sunlight on a rifle barrel in the window\r\nof the cabin.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blake stopped, but he did not turn. \"Are you Mr. Winslow?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"That's nothing to you! Get out! Quick!\"\r\n\r\nBlake was thinking fast. Here was the man, without doubt--and he was\r\nhostile as an Apache; the man behind that harsh voice meant business.\r\nHow could he reach him? The inspiration came at once. McGuire was the\r\nkey.\r\n\r\n\"If you're Winslow,\" he called in a steady voice, \"you don't want me\r\nto go away; you want to talk with me. There's a young friend of yours\r\nin a bad jam. You are the only one who can help.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any friends,\" said the rasping voice: \"I don't want any!\r\nGet out!\"\r\n\r\n\"You had one,\" said the captain, \"whether you wanted him or not. He\r\nbelieved in you--like the other young chap who went with you to the\r\nmoon.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was an audible gasp of dismay from the window beyond, and the\r\nbarrel of the rifle made trembling flickerings in the sun.\r\n\r\n\"You mean the flyer?\" asked the voice, and it seemed to have lost its\r\nharsher note. \"The pleasant young fellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean McGuire, who helped give decent burial to your friend. And now\r\nhe has been carried off--out into space--and you can help him. If\r\nyou've a spark of decency in you, you will hear what I have to say.\"\r\n\r\nThe rifle vanished within the cabin; a door opened to frame a picture\r\nof a tall man. He was stooped; the years, or solitude, perhaps, had\r\nborne heavily upon him; his face was a mat of gray beard that was a\r\ncontinuation of the unkempt hair above. The rifle was still in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nBut he motioned to the waiting man, and \"Come in!\" he commanded. \"I'll\r\nsoon know if you're telling the truth. God help you if you're not....\r\nCome in.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour was needed while the bearded man learned the truth. And Blake,\r\ntoo, picked up some facts. He learned to his great surprise that he\r\nwas talking with an educated man, one who had spent a lifetime in\r\nscientific pursuits. And now, as the figure before him seemed more the\r\nscientist and less the crazed fabricator of wild fancies, the truth of\r\nhis claims seemed not so remote.\r\n\r\nHalf demented now, beyond a doubt! A lifetime of disappointments and\r\none invention after another stolen from him by those who knew more of\r\nlaw than of science. And now he held fortune in the secret of his\r\nship--a secret which he swore should never be given to the world.\r\n\r\n\"Damn the world!\" he snarled. \"Did the world ever give anything to me?\r\nAnd what would they do with this? They would prostitute it to their\r\nown selfish ends; it would be just one more means to conquer and kill;\r\nand the capitalists would have it in their own dirty hands so that new\r\nlines of transportation beyond anything they dared dream would be\r\ntheirs to exploit.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBlake, remembering the history of a commercial age, found no ready\r\nreply to that. But he told the man of McGuire and the things that had\r\nmade him captive; he related what he, himself, had seen in the dark\r\nnight on Mount Lawson, and he told of the fragmentary message that\r\nshowed McGuire was still alive.\r\n\r\n\"There's only one way to save him,\" he urged. \"If your ship is what\r\nyou claim it is--and I believe you one hundred per cent--it is all\r\nthat can save him from what will undoubtedly be a horrible death.\r\nThose things were monsters--inhuman!--and they have bombarded the\r\nearth. They will come back in less than a year and a half to destroy\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Blake would have said he was no debater, but the argument and\r\npersuasion that he used that night would have done credit to a\r\nSocrates. His opponent was difficult to convince, and not till the\r\nnext day did the inventor show Blake his ship.\r\n\r\n\"Small,\" he said as he led the flyer toward it. \"Designed just for the\r\nmoon trip, and I had meant to go alone. But it served; it took us\r\nthere and back again.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw open a door in the side of the metal cylinder. Blake stood\r\nback for only a moment to size up the machine, to observe its smooth\r\nduralumin shell and the rounded ends where portholes opened for the\r\nexpelling of its driving blast. The door opening showed a thick wall\r\nthat gave insulation. Blake followed the inventor to the interior of\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe man had seen Winslow examining the thick walls. \"It's cold out\r\nthere, you know,\" he said, and smiled in recollection, \"but the\r\ngenerator kept us warm.\" He pointed to a simple cylindrical casting\r\naft of the ship's center part. It was massive, and braced to the\r\nframework of the ship to distribute a thrust that Blake knew must be\r\ntremendous. Heavy conduits took the blast that it produced and poured\r\nit from ports at bow and stern. There were other outlets, too, above\r\nand below and on the sides, and electric controls that were\r\nmanipulated from a central board.\r\n\r\n\"You've got a ship,\" Blake admitted, \"and it's a beauty. I know\r\nconstruction, and you've got it here. But what is the power? How do\r\nyou drive it? What throws it out through space?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aside from one other, you will be the only man ever to know.\" The\r\nbearded man was quiet now and earnest. The wild light had faded from\r\nhis eyes, and he pondered gravely in making the last and final\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you shall have it. It may be I have been mistaken. I have known\r\npeople--some few--who were kindly and decent; I have let the others\r\nprejudice me. But there was one who was my companion--and there was\r\nMcGuire, who was kind and who believed. And now you, who will give\r\nyour life for a friend and to save humanity!... You shall have it. You\r\nshall have the ship! But I will not go with you. I want nothing of\r\nglory or fame, and I am too old to fight. My remaining years I choose\r\nto spend out here.\" He pointed where a window of heavy glass showed\r\nthe outer world and a grave on a sloping hill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"But you shall have full instructions. And, for the present, you may\r\nknow that it is a continuous explosion that drives the ship. I have\r\nlearned to decompose water into its components and split them into\r\nsubatomic form. They reunite to give something other than matter. It\r\nis a liquid--liquid energy, though the term is inaccurate--that\r\nseparates out in two forms, and a fluid ounce of each is the product\r\nof thousands of tons of water. The potential energy is all there. A\r\ncurrent releases it; the energy components reunite to give matter\r\nagain--hydrogen and oxygen gas. Combustion adds to their volume\r\nthrough heat.\r\n\r\n\"It is like firing a cannon in there,\"--he pointed now to the massive\r\ngenerator--\"a super-cannon of tremendous force and a cannon that fires\r\ncontinuously. The endless pressure of expansion gives the thrust that\r\nmeans a constant acceleration of motion out there where gravity is\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n\"You will note,\" he added, \"that I said 'constant acceleration.' It\r\nmeans building up to speeds that are enormous.\"\r\n\r\nBlake nodded in half-understanding.\r\n\r\n\"We will want bigger ships,\" he mused. \"They must mount guns and be\r\nheavy enough to take the recoil. This is only a sample; we must\r\ndesign, experiment, build them! Can it be done? ... It _must_ be\r\ndone!\" he concluded and turned to the inventor.\r\n\r\n\"We don't know much about those devils of the stars, and they may have\r\nmeans of attack beyond anything we can conceive, but there is just one\r\nway to learn: go up there and find out, and take a licking if we have\r\nto. Now, how about taking me up a mile or so in the air?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other smiled in self-deprecation. \"I like a good fighter,\" he\r\nsaid; \"I was never one myself. If I had been I would have accomplished\r\nmore. Yes, you shall go up a mile or so in the air--and a thousand\r\nmiles beyond.\" He turned to close the door and seal it fast.\r\n\r\nBeside the instrument board he seated himself, and at his touch the\r\ngenerator of the ship came startlingly to life. It grumbled softly at\r\nfirst, then the hoarse sound swelled to a thunderous roar, while the\r\nmetal grating surged up irresistibly beneath the captain's feet. His\r\nweight was intolerable. He sank helplessly to the floor....\r\n\r\nBlake was white and shaken when he alighted from the ship an hour\r\nlater, but his eyes were ablaze with excitement. He stopped to seize\r\nthe tall man by the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"I am only a poor devil of a flying man,\" he said, \"but I am speaking\r\nfor the whole world right now. You have saved us; you've furnished the\r\nmeans. It is up to us now. You've given us the right to hope that\r\nhumanity can save itself, if humanity will do it. That's my next\r\njob--to convince them. We have less than a year and a half....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was one precious week wasted while Captain Blake chafed and\r\nwaited for a conference to be arranged at Washington. A spirit of\r\nhopelessness had swept over the world--hopelessness and a mental sloth\r\nthat killed every hope with the unanswerable argument: \"What is the\r\nuse? It is the end.\" But a meeting was arranged at Colonel Boynton's\r\ninsistence, though his superiors scoffed at what he dared suggest.\r\n\r\nBlake appeared before the meeting, and he told them what he knew--told\r\nit to the last detail, while he saw the looks of amusement or\r\ncommiseration that passed from man to man.\r\n\r\nThere were scientists there who asked him coldly a question or two and\r\nshrugged a supercilious shoulder; ranking officers of both army and\r\nnavy who openly excoriated Colonel Boynton for bringing them to hear\r\nthe wild tale of a half-demented man. It was this that drove Blake to\r\na cold frenzy.\r\n\r\nThe weeks of hopeless despair had worn his nerves to the breaking\r\npoint, and now, with so much to be done, and so little time in which\r\nto do it, all requirements of official etiquette were swept aside as\r\nhe leaped to his feet to face the unbelieving men.\r\n\r\n\"Damn it!\" he shouted, \"will you sit here now and quibble over what\r\nyou think in your wisdom is possible or not. Get outside those\r\ndoors--there's an open park beyond--and I'll knock your technicalities\r\nall to hell!\"\r\n\r\nThe door slammed behind him before the words could be spoken to place\r\nhim under arrest, and he tore across a velvet lawn to leap into a\r\ntaxi.\r\n\r\nThere was a rising storm of indignant protest within the room that he\r\nhad left. There were admirals, purple of face, who made heated remarks\r\nabout the lack of discipline in the army, and generals who turned\r\naccusingly where the big figure of Colonel Boynton was still seated.\r\n\r\nIt was the Secretary of War who stilled the tumult and claimed the\r\nprivilege of administering the rebuke which was so plainly needed.\r\n\"Colonel Boynton,\" he said, and there was no effort to soften the\r\ncutting edge of sarcasm in his voice, \"it was at your request and\r\nsuggestion that this outrageous meeting was held. Have you any more\r\nrequests or suggestions?\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel rose slowly to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Secretary,\" he said coldly, \"I have. I know Captain Blake.\r\nHe seldom makes promises; when he does he makes good. My suggestion is\r\nthat you do what the gentleman said--step outside and see your\r\ntechnicalities knocked to hell.\" He moved unhurriedly toward the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a half-hour's wait, and one or two of the more openly skeptical\r\nhad left when the first roar came faintly from above. Colonel Boynton\r\nled the others to the open ground before the building. \"I have always\r\nfound Blake a man of his word,\" he said quietly, and pointed upward\r\nwhere a tiny speck was falling from a cloud-flecked sky.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blake had had little training in the operation of the ship,\r\nbut he had flown it across the land and had concealed it where fellow\r\nofficers were sworn to secrecy. And he felt that he knew how to handle\r\nthe controls.\r\n\r\nBut the drop from those terrible heights was a fearful thing, and it\r\nended only a hundred feet above the heads of the cowering, shouting\r\nhumans who crouched under the thunderous blast, where a great shell\r\nchecked its vertical flight and rebounded to the skies.\r\n\r\nAgain and again the gleaming cylinder drove at them like a projectile\r\nfrom the mortars of the gods, and it roared and thundered through the\r\nair or turned to vanish with incredible speed straight up into the\r\nheights, to return and fall again ... until finally it hung motionless\r\na foot above the grass from which the uniformed figures had fled. Only\r\nColonel Boynton was there to greet the flyer as he laid his strange\r\ncraft gently down.\r\n\r\n\"Nice little show, Captain,\" he said, while his broad face broke into\r\nthe widest of grins. \"A damn nice little show! But take that look off\r\nof your face. They'll listen to you now; they'll eat right out of your\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nIf Lieutenant McGuire could have erased from his mind the thought of\r\nthe threat that hung over the earth he would have found nothing but\r\nintensest pleasure in the experiences that were his.\r\n\r\nBut night after night they had heard the reverberating echoes of the\r\ngiant gun speeding its messenger of death toward the earth, and he saw\r\nas plainly as if he were there the terrible destruction that must come\r\nwhere the missiles struck. Gas, of course; that seemed the chief and\r\nonly weapon of these monsters, and Djorn, the elected leader of the\r\nVenus folk, confirmed him in this surmise.\r\n\r\n\"We had many gases,\" he told McGuire, \"but we used them for good ends.\r\nYou people of Earth--or these invaders, if they conquer Earth--must\r\nsome day engage in a war more terrible than wars between men. The\r\ninsects are your greatest foe. With a developing civilization goes the\r\nmultiplication of insect and bacterial life. We used the gases for\r\nthat war, and we made this world a heaven.\" He sighed regretfully for\r\nhis lost world.\r\n\r\n\"These red ones found them, and our factories for making them. But\r\nthey have no gift for working out or mastering the other means we had\r\nfor our defense--the electronic projectors, the creation of tremendous\r\nmagnetic fields: you saw one when we destroyed the attacking ships.\r\nOur scientists had gone far--\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to Heaven you had some of them to use now,\" said the\r\nlieutenant savagely, and the girl, Althora, standing near, smiled in\r\nsympathy for the flyer's distress. But her brother, Djorn, only\r\nmurmured: \"The lust to kill: that is something to be overcome.\"\r\n\r\nThe fatalistic resignation of these folk was disturbing to a man of\r\naction like McGuire. His eyes narrowed, and his lips were set for an\r\nabrupt retort when Althora intervened.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" she said, and took the flyer's hand. \"It is time for food.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe took him to the living quarters occupied by her brother and\r\nherself, where opal walls and jewelled inlays were made lovely by the\r\nsoft light that flooded the rooms.\r\n\r\n\"Just one tablet,\" she said, and brought him a thin white disc, \"then\r\nplenty of water. You must take this compressed food often and in small\r\nquantities till your system is accustomed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You make this?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"But certainly. Our chemists are learned men. We should lack for food,\r\notherwise, here in our underground home.\"\r\n\r\nHe let the tablet dissolve in his mouth. Althora leaned forward to\r\ntouch his hand gently.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry,\" she said, \"that you and Djorn fail to understand one\r\nanother. He is good--so good! But you--you, too, are good, and you\r\nfear for the safety of your own people.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will be killed to the last woman and child,\" he replied, \"or\r\nthey will be captured, which will be worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" she told him, and pressed his hand; \"and if I can\r\nhelp, Lieutenant Mack Guire, I shall be so glad.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled at her stilted pronunciation of his name. He had had the\r\ngirl for an almost constant companion since his arrival; the sexes, he\r\nfound, were on a level of mutual freedom, and the girl's companionship\r\nwas offered and her friendship expressed as openly as might have been\r\nthat of a youth. Of Sykes he saw little; Professor Sykes was deep in\r\nastronomical discussions with the scientists of this world.\r\n\r\nBut she was charming, this girl of a strange race so like his own. A\r\nskin from the velvet heart of a rose and eyes that looked deep into\r\nhis and into his mind when he permitted; eyes, too, that could crinkle\r\nto ready laughter or grow misty when she sang those weird melodies of\r\nsuch thrilling sweetness.\r\n\r\nOnly for the remembrance of Earth and the horrible feeling of impotent\r\nfury, Lieutenant McGuire would have found much to occupy his thoughts\r\nin this loveliest of companions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe laughed now at the sounding of his name, and the girl laughed with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"But it _is_ your name, is it not?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant Thomas McGuire,\" he repeated, \"and those who like me call\r\nme 'Mac.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Mac,\" she repeated. \"But that is so short and hard sounding. And what\r\ndo those who love you say?\"\r\n\r\nThe flyer grinned cheerfully. \"There aren't many who could qualify in\r\nthat respect, but if there were they would call me Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is better,\" said Althora with engaging directness; \"that is much\r\nbetter--Tommy.\" Then she sprang to her feet and hurried him out where\r\nsome further wonders must be seen and exclaimed over without delay.\r\nBut Lieutenant McGuire saw the pink flush that crept into her face,\r\nand his own heart responded to the telltale betrayal of her feeling\r\nfor him. For never in his young and eventful life had the man found\r\nanyone who seemed so entirely one with himself as did this lovely girl\r\nfrom a distant star.\r\n\r\nHe followed where she went dancing on her way, but not for long could\r\nhis mind be led away from the menace he could not forget. And on this\r\nday, as on many days to come, he struggled and racked his brain to\r\nfind some way in which he could thwart the enemy and avert or delay\r\ntheir stroke.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was another day, and they were some months on their long journey\r\naway from the earth when an inspiration came. Althora had offered to\r\nhelp, and he knew well how gladly she would aid him; the feeling\r\nbetween them had flowered into open, if unspoken love. Not that he\r\nwould subject her to any danger--he himself would take all of that\r\nwhen it came--but meanwhile--\r\n\r\n\"Althora,\" he asked her, \"can you project your mind into that of one\r\nof the reds?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could, easily,\" she replied, \"but it would not be pleasant. Their\r\nminds are horrible; they reek of evil things.\" She shuddered at the\r\nthought, but the man persisted.\r\n\r\n\"But if you could help, would you be willing? I can do so little; I\r\ncan never stop them; but I may save my people from some suffering at\r\nleast. Here is my idea:\r\n\r\n\"Djorn tells me that I had it figured right: they plan an invasion of\r\nthe earth when next the two planets approach. He has told me of their\r\narmies and their fleets of ships that will set off into space. I can't\r\nprevent it; I am helpless! But if I knew what their leader was\r\nthinking--\"\r\n\r\n\"Torg!\" she exclaimed. \"You want to know the mind of that beast of\r\nbeasts!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the man. \"It might be of value. Particularly if I could\r\nknow something of their great gun--where it is and what it is--well, I\r\nmight do something about that.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl averted her eyes from the savage determination on his face.\r\n\"No--no!\" she exclaimed; \"I could not. Not Torg!\"\r\n\r\nMcGuire's own face fell at the realization of the enormity of this\r\nfavor he had demanded. \"That's all right,\" he said and held her soft\r\nhand in his; \"just forget it. I shouldn't have asked.\"\r\n\r\nBut she whispered as she turned to walk away: \"I must think, I must\r\nthink. You ask much of me, Tommy; but oh, Tommy, I would do much for\r\nyou!\" She was sobbing softly as she ran swiftly away.\r\n\r\nAnd the man in khaki--this flyer of a distant air-service--strode\r\nblindly off to rage and fume at his helplessness and his inability to\r\nstrike one blow at those beings who lived in that world above.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were countless rooms and passages where the work of the world\r\nbelow went on. There were men and women whose artistic ability found\r\noutlet in carvings and sculpture, chemists and others whose work was\r\nthe making of foods and endless experimentation, some thousand of men\r\nand women in the strength of their endless youth, who worked for the\r\nlove of the doing and lived contentedly and happily while they waited\r\nfor the day of their liberation. But of fighters there were none, and\r\nfor this Lieutenant McGuire grieved wholeheartedly.\r\n\r\nHe was striding swiftly along where a corridor ended in blackness\r\nahead. There was a gleaming machine on the floor beside him when a\r\nhand clutched at his arm and a warning voice exclaimed: \"No further,\r\nLieutenant McGuire; you must not go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" questioned the lieutenant. \"I've got to walk--do something to\r\nkeep from this damnable futile thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not there,\" said the other; \"it is a place of death. Ten paces\r\nmore and you would have vanished in a flicker of flame. The\r\nprojector\"--he touched the mechanism beside them--\"is always on. Our\r\ncaves extend in an endless succession; they join with the labyrinth\r\nwhere the red ones used to live. They could attack us but for this.\r\nNothing can live in its invisible ray; they are placed at all such\r\nentrances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet Djorn,\" McGuire told himself slowly, \"said they had no weapons.\r\nHe knows nothing of war. But, great heavens! what wouldn't I give for\r\na regiment of scrappers--good husky boys with their faces tanned and a\r\nspark in their eyes and their gas masks on their chests. With a\r\nregiment, and equipment like this--\"\r\n\r\nAnd again he realized the futility of armament with none to serve and\r\ndirect it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a month or more before Althora consented to the tests. Djorn\r\nadvised against it and made his protest emphatic, but here, as in all\r\nthings, Althora was a free agent. It was her right to do as she saw\r\nfit, and there was none to prevent in this small world where\r\nindividual liberty was unquestioned.\r\n\r\nAnd it was still longer before she could get anything of importance.\r\nThe experiments were racking to her nerves, and McGuire, seeing the\r\nterrible strain upon her, begged her to stop. But Althora had gained\r\nthe vision that was always before her loved one's eyes--a world of\r\ndeath and disaster--and he, here where the bolt would be launched, and\r\npowerless to prevent. She could not be dissuaded now.\r\n\r\nIt was a proud day for Althora when she sent for McGuire, and he found\r\nher lying at rest, eyes closed in her young face that was lined and\r\ntortured with the mental horror she was contacting. She silenced his\r\nprotests with a word.\r\n\r\n\"The gun,\" she whispered; \"they are talking about the gun ... and the\r\nbombardment ... planning....\"\r\n\r\nMore silent concentration. Then:\r\n\r\n\"The island of Bergo,\" she said, \"--remember that! The gun is there ...\r\na great bore in the earth ... solid rock ... but the casing of\r\ntitanite must be reinforced ... and bands shrunk about the muzzle that\r\nprojects ... heavy bands ... it shows signs of distortion--the\r\nheat!...\"\r\n\r\nShe was listening to the thoughts, and selecting those that bore upon\r\ngun.\r\n\r\n\"... Only fifty days ... the bombardment must begin ... Tahnor has\r\nprovided a hundred shells; two thousand tals of the green gas-powder\r\nin each one ... the explosive charges ready ... yes--yes!...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed and opened her troubled eyes. \"The beast is so\r\ncomplacent, so sure! And the bombardment will begin in fifty days!\r\nWill it really cause them anguish on your Earth, Tommy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just plain hell; that's all!\"\r\n\r\nMcGuire's voice was low; his mind was reaching out to find and reject\r\none plan after another. The gun!... He must disable it; he could do\r\nthat much at least. For himself--well, what of it?--he would die, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe guard he had been taught to place about his own thoughts must have\r\nrelaxed, for Althora cried out in distress.\r\n\r\n\"No--no!\" she protested; \"you shall not! I have tried to help you,\r\nTommy dear--say that I have helped you!--but, oh, my beloved, do not\r\ngo. Do not risk your life to silence this one weapon. They would still\r\nhave their ships. Remember what Djorn has told of their mighty fleets,\r\ntheir thousands of fighting men. You cannot stop them; you can hardly\r\nhinder them. And you would throw away your life! Oh, please do not\r\ngo!\"\r\n\r\nMcGuire was seated beside her. His face was hidden in one hand while\r\nthe other was held tight between the white palms of Althora's tense\r\nhands. He said nothing, and he shielded his eyes and locked his mind\r\nagainst her thought force.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy,\" said Althora, and now her voice was all love and softness,\r\n\"Tommy, my dear one! You will not go, for what can you do? And if you\r\nstay--oh, my dear!--you can have what you will--the secret of life\r\nshall be yours--to live forever in perpetual youth. You may have that.\r\nAnd me, Tommy.... Would you throw your life away in a hopeless\r\nattempt, when life might hold so much? Am I offering so little,\r\nTommy?\"\r\n\r\nAnd still the silence and the hand that kept the eyes from meeting\r\nhers; then a long-drawn breath and a slim figure in khaki that stood\r\nunconsciously erect to look, not at the girl, but out beyond the solid\r\nwalls, through millions of miles of space, to the helpless speck\r\ncalled Earth.\r\n\r\n\"You offer me heaven, my dear,\" he spoke softly. \"But sometimes\"--and\r\nhis lips twisted into a ghost of a smile--\"sometimes, to earn our\r\nheaven, we have to fight like hell. And, if we fail to make the fight,\r\nwhat heaven worth having is left?\r\n\r\n\"And the people,\" he said softly; \"the homes in the cities and towns\r\nand villages. My dear, that's part of loving a soldier: you can never\r\nown him altogether; his allegiance is divided. And if I failed my own\r\nfolk what right would I have to you?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe dared to look at the girl who lay before him. That other vision was\r\ngone but he had seen a clear course charted, and now, with his mind at\r\nrest, he could smile happily at the girl who was looking up at him\r\nthrough her tears.\r\n\r\nShe rose slowly to her feet and stood before him to lay firm hands\r\nupon his shoulders. She was almost as tall as he, and her eyes, that\r\nhad shaken off their tears but for a dewy fringe, looked deep and\r\nstraight into his.\r\n\r\n\"We have thought,\" she said slowly, \"we people of this world, that we\r\nwere superior to you and yours; we have accepted you as someone a\r\nshade below our plane of advancement. Yes, we have dared to believe\r\nthat. But I know better. We have gone far, Tommy, we people of this\r\nstar; we have lived long. Yet I am wondering if we have lost some\r\nvirtues that are the heritage of a sterner race.\r\n\r\n\"But I am learning, Tommy; I am so thankful that I can learn and that\r\nI have had you to teach me. We will go together, you and I. We will\r\nfight our fight, and, the Great One willing, we will earn our heaven\r\nor find it elsewhere--together.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward to kiss the tall man squarely upon the lips with\r\nher own soft rose-petal lips that clung and clung ... and the reply of\r\nLieutenant McGuire, while it was entirely wordless, seemed eminently\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthora, the beautiful daughter of Venus, had the charm and allure of\r\nher planet's fabled namesake. But she thought like a man and she\r\nplanned like a man. And there was no dissuading her from her course.\r\nShe was to fight beside McGuire--that was her intention--and beyond\r\nthat there was no value in argument. McGuire was forced to accept the\r\ninsistent aid, and he needed help.\r\n\r\nSykes dropped his delving into astronomical lore and answered to the\r\ncall, but there was no other assistance. Only the three, McGuire,\r\nAlthora and Sykes. There were some who would agree to pilot the\r\nsubmarine that was being outfitted, but they would have no part in the\r\nventure beyond transporting the participants.\r\n\r\nMore than once McGuire paused to curse silently at the complaisance of\r\nthis people. What could he not do if they would help. Ten companies of\r\ntrained men, armed with their deadly electronic projectors that\r\ndisintegrated any living thing they reached--and he would clutch at\r\nhis tousled hair and realize that they were only three, and go grimly\r\nback to work.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what we can do till we get there,\" he told Sykes. \"Here\r\nwe are, and there is the gun: that is all we know, except that the\r\nthing must be tremendous and our only hope is that there is some\r\nfiring mechanism that we can destroy. The gun itself is a great\r\ndrilling in the solid rock, lined with one of their steel alloys, and\r\nwith a big barrel extending up into the air: Althora has learned that.\r\n\r\n\"They went deep into the rock and set the firing chamber there; it's\r\nheavy enough to stand the stress. They use a gas-powder, as Althora\r\ncalls it, for the charge, and the same stuff but deadlier is in the\r\nshell. But they must have underground workings for loading and firing.\r\nIs there a chance for us to get in there, I wonder! There's the big\r\nbarrel that projects. We might ... but no!--that's too big for us to\r\ntackle, I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about that electronic projector on the submarine?\" Sykes\r\nsuggested. \"Remember how it melted out the heart of that big ship? We\r\ncould do a lot with that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a chance! Djorn and the others have strictly forbidden the men to\r\nturn it on the enemy since they have given no offense.\r\n\r\n\"No offense!\" he repeated, and added a few explosive remarks.\r\n\r\n\"No, it looks like a case of get there and do what dirty work we can\r\nto their mechanism before they pot us--and that's that!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut Sykes was directing his thoughts along another path.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder ...\" he mused; \"it might be done: they have laboratories.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about? For the love of heaven, man, if you're\r\ngot an idea, let's have it. I'm desperate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nitrators!\" said the scientist. \"I have been getting on pretty good\r\nterms with the scientific crowd here, and I've seen some mighty pretty\r\nmanufacturing laboratories. And they have equipment that was never\r\nmeant for the manufacture of nitro-explosives, but, with a few\r\nmodifications--yes, I think it could be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean nitro-glycerine? TNT?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something like that. Depends upon what materials we can get to start\r\nwith.\"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant was pounding his companion upon the back and shouting\r\nhis joy at this faintest echo of encouragement.\r\n\r\n\"We'll plant it alongside the gun--No, we'll get into their working\r\nunderground. We'll blow their equipment into scrap-iron, and perhaps\r\nwe can even damage the gun itself!\" He was almost beside himself with\r\nexcitement at thought of a weapon being placed in his straining\r\nhelpless hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was the earth-shaking thunder of the big gun that hastened their\r\nfinal preparations and made McGuire tremble with suppressed excitement\r\nwhere he helped Sykes to draw off a syrupy liquid into heavy crystal\r\nflasks.\r\n\r\nThere were many of these, and the two men would allow no others to\r\ntouch them, but stored them themselves and nested each one in a soft\r\nbed within the submarine. Then one last repetition of their\r\nhalf-formed plans to Djorn and his followers and a rush toward the\r\nwharf where the submarine was waiting.\r\n\r\nAlthora was waiting, too, and McGuire wasted minutes in a petition\r\nthat he knew was futile.\r\n\r\n\"Wait here, Althora,\" he begged. \"I will come back; this is no venture\r\nfor you to undertake. I can take my chances with them, but you--! It\r\nis no place for you,\" he concluded lamely.\r\n\r\n\"There is no other place for me,\" she said; \"only where you are.\" And\r\nshe led the way while the others followed into the lighted control\r\nroom of the big under-water craft.\r\n\r\nMcGuire's eyes were misty with a blurring of tears that were partly\r\nfrom excitement, but more from a feeling of helpless remonstrance that\r\nwas mingled with pure pride. And his lips were set in a straight line.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic pull that held them to their anchorage was reversed; the\r\nship beneath them was slipping smoothly beneath the surface and out to\r\nsea, guided through its tortuous windings of water-worn caves and\r\nrocky chambers under the sea by the invisible electric cords that drew\r\nit where they would.\r\n\r\nAnd ahead on some mysterious island was a gun, a thing of size and\r\npower beyond anything of Earth. He was going to spike that gun if it\r\nwas the last act of his life; and Althora was going with him. He drew\r\nher slim body to him, while his eyes stared blindly, hopefully, toward\r\nwhat the future held.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nThroughout the night they drove hour after hour at terrific speed. The\r\nship was running submerged, for McGuire was taking no slightest chance\r\nof their being observed from the air. He and the others slept at\r\ntimes, for the crew that handled the craft very evidently knew the\r\nexact course, and there were mechanical devices that insured their\r\nsafety. A ray was projected continuously ahead of them; it would\r\nreflect back and give on an indicator instant warning of any derelict\r\nor obstruction. Another row of quivering needles gave by the same\r\nmethod the soundings from far ahead.\r\n\r\nBut the uncertainty of what their tomorrow might hold and the worry\r\nand dread lest he find himself unable to damage the big gun made real\r\nrest impossible for McGuire.\r\n\r\nBut he was happy and buoyant with hope when, at last, the green light\r\nfrom the ports showed that the sun was shining up above, and the\r\nslackening drive of the submarine's powerful motors told that their\r\nobjective was in sight.\r\n\r\nThey lay quietly at last while a periscope of super-sensitiveness was\r\nthrust cautiously above the water. It brought in a panoramic view of\r\nthe shoreline ahead, amplified it and projected the picture in\r\nclear-cut detail upon a screen. If Lieutenant McGuire had stood on the\r\nwet deck above and looked directly at the island the sight could have\r\nbeen no clearer. The colors of torn and blasted tree-growths showed in\r\nall their pale shades, and there was stereoscopic depth to the picture\r\nthat gave no misleading illusions as to distance.\r\n\r\nThe shore was there with the white spray of breakers on a rocky shoal,\r\nand a beach beyond. And beyond that, in hard outline against a golden\r\nsky, was a gigantic tube that stood vertically in air to reach beyond\r\nthe upper limits of the periscope's vision.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMcGuire tingled at the sight. To be within reach of this weapon that\r\nhad sent those blasting, devastating missiles upon the earth! He paced\r\nback and forth in the small room to stop and stare again, and resume\r\nhis pacing that helped to while away the hours they must wait. For\r\nthere were man-shapes swarming over the land, and the dull, blood-red\r\nof their loose uniforms marked them as members of the fighting force\r\nspawned by this prolific breed.\r\n\r\n\"Not a chance until they're out of the picture,\" said the impatient\r\nman; \"they would snow us under. It's just as I thought: we must wait\r\nuntil the gun is ready to fire; then they will beat it. They won't\r\nwant to be around when that big boy cuts loose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\" asked Althora.\r\n\r\n\"Then Sykes and I will take our collection of gallon flasks ashore,\r\nand I sure hope we don't stumble.\" He grinned cheerfully at the girl.\r\n\r\n\"That reinforced concrete dome seems to be where they get down into\r\nthe ground; it is close to the base of the gun. We will go there--blow\r\nit open if we have to--but manage in some way to get down below. Then\r\na time-fuse on the charge, and the boat will take me off, and we will\r\nleave as fast as these motors can drive us.\"\r\n\r\nHe omitted to mention any possible danger to Sykes and himself in the\r\nhandling of their own explosive, and he added casually, \"You will stay\r\nhere and see that there is no slip-up on the getaway.\"\r\n\r\nHe had to translate the last remark into language the girl could\r\nunderstand. But Althora shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"You do try so hard to get rid of me, Tommy,\" the laughed, \"but it is\r\nno use. I am going with you--do not argue--and I will help you with\r\nthe attack. Three will work faster than two--and I am going.\"\r\n\r\nMcGuire was silent, then nodded his assent. He was learning, this\r\nEarth-man, what individual freedom really meant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnly the western sky showed golden masses on the shining screen when\r\nMcGuire spoke softly to the captain:\r\n\r\n\"Your men will put us ashore; you may ask them to stand by now.\" And\r\nto Professor Sykes, \"Better get that 'soup' of yours ready to load.\"\r\n\r\nThe red-clad figures were growing dim on the screen, and the blotches\r\nof colors that showed where they were grouped were few. Some there\r\nwere who left such groups to flee precipitately toward a waiting\r\nairship.\r\n\r\nThis was something the lieutenant had not foreseen. He had expected\r\nthat the force that served the gun would have some shock-proof\r\nshelter; he had not anticipated a fighting ship to take them away.\r\n\r\n\"That's good,\" he exulted; \"that is a lucky break. If they just get\r\nout of sight we will have the place to ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThere were no red patches on the screen now, and the picture thrown\r\nbefore them showed the big ship, its markings of red and white\r\ndistinct even in the shadow-light of late afternoon, rising slowly\r\ninto the air. It gathered speed marvelously and vanished to a speck\r\nbeyond the land.\r\n\r\n\"We're getting the breaks,\" said McGuire crisply. \"All right--let's\r\ngo!\"\r\n\r\nThe submarine rose smoothly, and the sealed doors in the\r\nsuperstructure were opened while yet there was water to come trickling\r\nin. Men came with a roll of cloth that spread open to the shape of a\r\nsmall boat, while a metal frame expanded within it to hold it taut.\r\n\r\nMcGuire gasped with dismay as a seaman launched it and leaped heavily\r\ninto the frail shell to attach a motor to one end.\r\n\r\n\"Metal!\" the captain reassured him; \"woven metal, and water-tight! You\r\ncould not pierce it with anything less than a projector.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSykes was ready with one of the crystal flasks as the boat was brought\r\nalongside, and McGuire followed with another. They took ten of the\r\nharmless-looking containers, and both men held their breaths as the\r\nboat grounded roughly on the boulder-strewn shore.\r\n\r\nThey lifted them out and bedded them in the sand, then returned to the\r\nsubmarine. This time Althora, too, stepped into the boat. They loaded\r\nin the balance of the containers; the motor purred. Another landing,\r\nand they stood at last on the island, where a mammoth tube towered\r\ninto the sky and the means for its destruction was at their feet.\r\n\r\nBut there was little time; already the light was dimming, and the time\r\nfor the firing of the big weapon was drawing near. The men worked like\r\nmad to carry the flasks to the base of the gun, where a dome of\r\nconcrete marked the entrance to the rooms below.\r\n\r\nEach man held a flask of the deadly fluid when Althora led the way\r\nwhere stairs went deep down into the earth under the domed roof. This\r\npart of the work had been foreseen, and the girl held a slender\r\ncylinder that threw a beam of light, intensely bright.\r\n\r\nThey found a surprising simplicity in the arrangements underground.\r\nTwo rooms only had been carved from the solid rock, and one of these\r\nended in a wall of gray metal that could be only the great base of the\r\ngun. But nowhere was a complication of mechanism that might be damaged\r\nor destroyed, nor any wiring or firing device.\r\n\r\nA round door showed sharp edges in the gray metal, but only the\r\nstrength of many men could have removed its huge bolts, and these two\r\nknew there must be other doors to seal in the mighty charge.\r\n\r\n\"Not a wire!\" the scientist exclaimed. \"How do they fire it?\" The\r\nanswer came to him with the question.\r\n\r\n\"Radio, of course; and the receiving set is in the charge itself; the\r\nbarrel of the gun is its own antenna. They must fire it from a\r\ndistance--back on the island where we were, perhaps. It would need to\r\nbe accurately timed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" shouted McGuire, and raised the flask of explosive to his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEach one knew the need for haste; each waited every moment for the\r\nterrible blast of gun-fire that would jar their bodies to a lifeless\r\npulp or, by detonating their own explosive, destroy them utterly. But\r\nthey carried the flasks again to the top, and the three of them worked\r\nbreathlessly to place their whole supply where McGuire directed.\r\n\r\nThe massive barrel of the gun was beside them; it was held in\r\ntremendous castings of metal that bolted to anchorage in the ground.\r\nOne great brace had an overhanging flange; the explosive was placed\r\nbeneath it.\r\n\r\nProfessor Sykes had come prepared. He attached a detonator to one of\r\nthe flasks, and while the other two were placing the explosive in\r\nposition he fastened two wires to the apparatus with steady but\r\nhurrying fingers; then at full speed he ran with the spool from which\r\nthe wires unwound.\r\n\r\nMcGuire and Althora were behind him, running for the questionable\r\nsafety of the sand-hills. Sykes stopped in the shelter of a tiny\r\nvalley where winds had heaped the sand.\r\n\r\n\"Down!\" he shouted. \"Get down--behind that sand dune, there!\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped beside them, the bared ends of the wires in his hands.\r\nThere was a battery, too, a case no larger than his hands. Professor\r\nSykes, it appeared, had gained some few concessions from his friends,\r\nwho had learned to respect him in the field of science.\r\n\r\nOne breathless moment he waited; then--\r\n\r\n\"Now!\" he whispered, and touched the battery's terminals with the bare\r\nwires.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo McGuire it seemed, in that instant of shattering chaos, that the\r\ngreat gun itself must have fired. He had known the jar of heavy\r\nartillery at close range; he had had experience with explosives. He\r\nhad even been near when a government arsenal had thrown the\r\ncountryside into a hell of jarring, ear-splitting pandemonium. But the\r\nconcussion that shook the earth under him now was like nothing he had\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe hill of sand that sheltered them vanished to sweep in a sheet\r\nabove their heads. And the air struck down with terrific weight, then\r\nleft them in an airless void that seemed to make their bodies swell\r\nand explode. It rushed back in a whirling gale to sweep showers of\r\nsand and pebbles over the helpless forms of the three who lay battered\r\nand stunned.\r\n\r\nAn instant that was like an age; then the scientist pointed with a\r\nweak and trembling hand where a towering spire of metallic gray leaned\r\nslowly in the air. So slowly it moved, to the eyes of the watchers--a\r\ngreat arc of gathering force and speed that shattered the ground where\r\nit struck.\r\n\r\n\"The gun!\" was all that the still-dazed lieutenant could say.\r\n\"The--the gun!\" And he fell to shivering uncontrollably, while tears\r\nof pure happiness streamed down his face.\r\n\r\nThe mammoth siege gun--the only weapon for bombardment of the helpless\r\nEarth--was a mass of useless metal, a futile thing that lay twisted\r\nand battered on the sands of the sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe submarine now showed at a distance; it had withdrawn, by\r\nprearrangement, to the shelter of the deeper water. McGuire looked\r\ncarefully at the watch on his wrist, and listened to make certain that\r\nthe explosion had not stopped it. Sykes had told him the length of the\r\nVenusian day--twenty hours and nineteen minutes of Earth time, and he\r\nhad made his calculations from the day of the Venusians. And, morning\r\nand night, McGuire had set his watch back and had learned to make a\r\nrough approximation of the time of that world.\r\n\r\nThe watch now said five-thirteen, and the sun was almost gone; a line\r\nof gold in the western sky; and McGuire knew that it was a matter only\r\nof minutes till the blast of the big gun would rock the island. One\r\nheavy section of the great barrel was resting upon the shattered base,\r\nand McGuire realized that this blocking of the monster's throat must\r\nmean it would tear itself and the island around it to fragments when\r\nit fired. He ran toward the beach and waved his arms wildly in air to\r\nurge on the speeding craft that showed dim and vague across the\r\nheaving sea.\r\n\r\nIt drove swiftly toward them and stopped for the launching of the\r\nlittle boat. There was a delay, and McGuire stood quivering with\r\nimpatience where the others, too, watched the huddle of figures on the\r\nsubmarine's deck.\r\n\r\nIt was Althora who first sensed their danger. Her voice was shrill\r\nwith terror as she seized McGuire's arm and pointed landward.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy--Tommy!\" she said. \"They are coming! I saw them!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA swarming of red figures over the nearby dunes gave quick\r\nconfirmation of her words. McGuire looked about him for a\r\nweapon--anything to add efficiency to his bare hands--and the swarm\r\nwas upon them as he looked.\r\n\r\nHe leaped quickly between Althora and the nearest figures that\r\nstretched out grasping hands, and a red face went white under the\r\nsmashing impact of the flyer's fist.\r\n\r\nThey poured over the sand-hills now---scores of leaping\r\nman-shapes--and McGuire knew in an instant of self-accusation that\r\nthere had been a shelter after all, where a portion of the enemy force\r\nhad stayed. The explosion had brought them, and now--\r\n\r\nHe struck in a raging frenzy at the grotesque things that came racing\r\nupon them. He knew Sykes was fighting too. He tore wildly at the lean\r\narms that bound him and kept him from those a step or two away who\r\nwere throwing the figure of a girl across the shoulders of one of\r\ntheir men, while her eyes turned hopelessly toward McGuire.\r\n\r\nThey threw the two men upon the sand and crowded to kneel on the\r\nprostrate bodies and strike and tear with their long hands, then tied\r\nthem at ankles and wrists with metal cords, and raised them helpless\r\nand bound in the air.\r\n\r\nOne of the red creatures pointed a long arm toward the demolished gun\r\nand shrieked something in a terror-filled tone. The others, at the\r\nsound, raced off through the sand, while those with the burden of the\r\nthree captives followed as best they could.\r\n\r\n\"The gun!\" said Professor Sykes in a thick voice: the words were\r\njolted out of him as the two who carried him staggered and ran. \"They\r\nknow--that it--hasn't--gone off--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe straggling troop that strung out across the dim-lit dunes was\r\napproaching another domed shelter of heavy concrete. They crowded\r\ninside, and the bodies of the three were thrown roughly to the floor,\r\nwhile the red creatures made desperate haste to close the heavy door.\r\nThen down they went into the deeper safety of a subterranean room,\r\nwhere the massive walls about them quivered to a nerve-deadening jar.\r\nIt shook those standing to the floor, and the silence that followed\r\nwas changed to a bedlam by the inhuman shrieking of the creatures who\r\nwere gloating over their safety and the capture they had achieved.\r\nThey leaped and capered in a maniacal outburst and ceased only at the\r\nshrill order of one who was in command.\r\n\r\nAt his direction the three were carried out of doors and thrown upon\r\nthe ground. McGuire turned his head to see the face of Althora. There\r\nwas blood trickling from a cut on her temple, and her eyes were dazed\r\nand blurred, but she managed a trembling smile for the anxious eyes of\r\nthe man who could only struggle hopelessly against the thin wires that\r\nheld him.\r\n\r\nAlthora hurt! Bound with those cutting metal cords! Althora--in such\r\nbeastly hands! He groaned aloud at the thought.\r\n\r\n\"You should never have come; I should never have let you. I have got\r\nyou into this!\" He groaned again in an agony of self-reproach, then\r\nlay silent and waited for what must come. And the answer to his\r\nspeculations came from the night above, where the lights of a ship\r\nmarked the approach of an enemy craft.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ships of the red race could travel fast, as McGuire knew, but the\r\nair monster whose shining, pointed beak hung above them where they lay\r\nhelpless in the torturing bonds of fine wire, was to give him a new\r\nconception of speed.\r\n\r\nIt shot to the five thousand-foot level, when the captives were safe\r\naboard, and the dark air shrieked like a tortured animal where the\r\nsteel shell tore it to tatters. And the radio, in an adjoining room,\r\nnever ceased in its sputtering, changing song.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the Earth-bombarding gun! The capture of the two\r\nEarth-men who had dared to fight back! And a captive woman of the\r\ndreaded race of true Venusians! There was excitement and news enough\r\nfor one world. And the discordant singing of the radio was sounding in\r\nthe ears of the leaders of that world.\r\n\r\nThey were waiting on the platform in the great hall where Sykes and\r\nMcGuire had stood, and their basilisk eyes glared unwinkingly down at\r\nthe three who were thrown at their feet.\r\n\r\nThe leader of them all, Torg himself, arose from his ornate throne and\r\nstrode forward for a closer view of the trophies his huntsmen had\r\nbrought in. A whistled word from him and the wires that had bound\r\nAlthora's slim ankles were cut, while a red-robed warrior dragged her\r\nroughly to her feet to stand trembling and swaying as the blood shot\r\ncruelly through her cramped limbs.\r\n\r\nTorg's eyes to McGuire were those of a devil feasting on human flesh,\r\nas he stared appraisingly and gloatingly at the girl who tried vainly\r\nto return the look without flinching. He spoke for a moment in a harsh\r\ntone, and the seated councilors echoed his weird notes approvingly.\r\n\r\n\"What does he say?\" McGuire implored, though he knew there could be\r\nnothing of good in that abominable voice. \"What does he say, Althora?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe face that turned slowly to him was drained of the last vestige of\r\ncolor. \"I--do not--know,\" she said in a whisper scarcely audible; \"but\r\nhe thinks--terrible things!\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed speaking of some nightmare vision as she added haltingly,\r\n\"There is a fleet of many ships, and Torg is in command. He has\r\nthousands of men, and he goes forth to conquer your Earth. He goes\r\nthere to rule.\" She had to struggle to bring the words to her lips\r\nnow. \"And--he takes me--with--him!\"\r\n\r\n\"No--no!\" the flyer protested, and he struggled insanely to free his\r\nhands from the wires that cut the deeper into his flesh. The voice of\r\nAlthora, clear and strong now, brought him back.\r\n\r\n\"I shall never go, Tommy; never! The gift of eternal life is mine, but\r\nit is mine to keep only if I will. But, for you and your friend--\" She\r\ntried to raise her hands to her trembling lips.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lieutenant McGuire quietly, \"for us--?\"\r\n\r\nBut there were some things the soft lips of Althora refused to say.\r\nAgain she tried vainly to raise her hands, then turned her white,\r\nstricken face that a loved one might not see the tears that were\r\nmingling with the blood-stains on her cheeks, nor read in her eyes the\r\nhorror they beheld.\r\n\r\nBut she found one crumb of comfort for the two doomed men.\r\n\r\n\"You will live till the sailing of the ships, Tommy,\" she choked, \"and\r\nthen--we will go together, Tommy--you and I.\"\r\n\r\nHer head was bowed and her shoulders shaking, but she raised her head\r\nproudly erect as she was seized by a guard whose blood-red hands\r\nforced her from the room.\r\n\r\nAnd the dry, straining eyes of Lieutenant McGuire, that watched her\r\ngoing, saw the passing to an unknown fate of all he held dear, and the\r\nend of his unspoken dreams.\r\n\r\nHe scarcely felt the grip of the hands that seized him, nor knew when\r\nhe and Sykes were carried from the room where Torg, the Emperor, held\r\nhis savage court. The stone walls of the room where they were thrown\r\ncould not hold his eyes; they looked through and beyond to see only\r\nthe white and piteous face of a girl whose lips were whispering: \"We\r\nwill go together, Tommy--you and I.\"\r\n\r\n(_Concluded in the next issue_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMYSTERIOUS CARLSBAD CAVERN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe largest cavern ever discovered, at Carlsbad Cavern, N. M., is soon\r\ngoing to be explored.\r\n\r\nCarlsbad Cavern is so large that that three sky-scrapers a half-mile\r\napart could be built in the largest of its innumerable \"rooms,\"\r\naccording to Mr. Nicholson, who was there once before, about a year\r\nago. Only 22 miles of the cavern's apparently limitless tunnels have\r\nbeen explored, revealing such natural beauties that President Coolidge\r\nestablished it as a national monument.\r\n\r\nThe stalagmites in the cavern tower 100 feet high. The age of the\r\ncavern was put at 60,000,000 years by Dr. Willis T. Lee of the\r\nNational Geographic Society, after his survey three years ago.\r\n\r\nThe caverns were discovered fifteen years ago by a New Mexican cowboy\r\nnamed Jim White, according to Mr. Nicholson. White was riding across a\r\ndesert waste one day when he saw what appeared to be smoke from a\r\nvolcano. After riding three hours in the direction of the smoke he\r\ndiscovered that it was an enormous cloud of bats issuing from the\r\nmouth of a gigantic cavern. He decided the cavern deserved\r\nexploration, and a few years later he and a Mexican boy were lowered\r\nin a barrel over the 750-foot cliff which overhangs the cavern.\r\n\r\nThe stalagmites of the cavern, according to Mr. Nicholson, are very\r\nvibrant and resonant. One can play a \"xylophone solo\" on them with\r\npractice, he said, but it is dangerous, since a certain pitch would\r\ncrack them.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the cavern is 56 degrees Fahrenheit, never varies,\r\nday and night, winter and summer. The air is purified every\r\ntwenty-four hours in some mysterious fashion, though there are no air\r\ncurrents. This is explained by the theory that there exists a great\r\nsubterranean stream at a lower level, probably 1,200 feet down.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of stalagmites will be collected and reconstructed for the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History. The explorers expect to find also\r\nflying fish, flying salamanders, rare insects and thousands of bats. A\r\nGovernment representative will go along, and drawings and motion\r\npictures will be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Readers' Corner_\r\n\r\n_A Meeting Place for Readers of ASTOUNDING STORIES_\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Letter and Comment_\r\n\r\nThree or four times in the year we have been issuing Astounding\r\nStories the Editor has received letters calling attention to fancied\r\nscientific errors in our stories. All these letters were published,\r\nbut until now we have not cut in on the space of \"The Readers' Corner\"\r\nto answer such objections because they were very obviously the result\r\nof hasty or inaccurate readings.\r\n\r\nThe other week one more such letter reached us--from Mr. Philip Waite,\r\nthis time--claiming that there was \"an atrocious flaw\" in two stories\r\nof Captain S. P. Meek's. This we could not let go unanswered, first\r\nbecause of the strong terms used, and second because the objection\r\nwould sound to many like a true criticism; so we turned the letter\r\nover to Captain Meek, and his answer follows Mr. Waite's letter below.\r\n\r\nWe welcome criticism of stories in our \"The Readers' Corner.\" Never\r\nyet have we withheld from it any criticism or brickbats of\r\nimportance--and we never intend to. But space is limited; there's not\r\nroom now for all the good letters that come in; and we do not want to\r\nintrude too much with editorial comment. Therefore when we do not stop\r\nand answer all criticisms we are not necessarily admitting they are\r\nvalid. In most cases everyone will quickly see their lack of logic or\r\naccuracy, and in the rest we will ask you to remember that our Staff\r\nis meticulously careful about the scientific facts and laws and\r\npossibilities that enter our stories, so it's extremely unlikely that\r\nanything very \"atrocious\" will get by.\r\n\r\nWell, we'd better cut short now, before we take up too much \"Corner\"\r\nroom. But first, thanks to Captain Meek for going to the trouble of\r\ndefending two stories that needed no defense. And thanks, too, to Mr.\r\nWaite, for his kindness in writing in to inform us of what he\r\nthought--unquestionably because of hasty reading--were errors.--_The\r\nEditor._\r\n\r\nP. S. (Now we'll have to be _super_ careful of our science, for if Mr.\r\nWaite ever gets anything on us--!!)\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nJust a note to tell you to keep up the good work. There was an\r\natrocious flaw, however, in the two stories by Capt. S. P. Meek about\r\nthe Heaviside Layer. How, may I ask, do meteors penetrate through that\r\nimaginary substance which is too much for a powerful space flyer?\r\nAlso, how about refraction? A substance denser than air would produce\r\nrefraction that would have been noticed long ago. I don't mind minor\r\nerrors, but an author has no right to ignore the facts so\r\noutrageously. Fiction goes too far when an author can invent such\r\nfalse conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the latest issue \"Stolen Brains\" was fine, up to the Dr. Bird\r\nstandard. \"The Invisible Death\" was good enough, but too much like the\r\ngeneral run to be noteworthy. \"Prisoners on the Electron\"--couldn't\r\nstomach it. Too hackneyed. \"Jetta of the Lowlands,\" by Ray Cummings;\r\nnuff said. \"An Extra Man\"--original idea and perfectly written. One of\r\nthe reasons I hang on to Science Fiction. A perfect gem.--Philip\r\nWaite, 3400 Wayne Ave., New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nMay I use enough space in your discussion columns to reply briefly to\r\nthe objections raised to the science in my two stories, \"Beyond the\r\nHeaviside Layer\" and \"The Attack from Space\"? Understand that I am not\r\narguing that there actually is a thick wall of semi-plastic material\r\nsurrounding the earth through which a space flyer could not pass. If I\r\ndid, I would automatically bar myself from writing interplanetary\r\nstories, a thing that is far from my desires. I do wish to point out,\r\nhowever, that such a layer might exist, so far as we at present know.\r\nThe objections to which I wish to reply are two: first, \"How do\r\nmeteors pass through that imaginary substance which is too much for a\r\npowerful space flyer?\" and second, \"How about refraction?\"\r\n\r\nTo reply to the first we must consider two things, kinetic energy and\r\nresistance to the passage of a body. The kinetic energy of a moving\r\nbody is represented by the formula 1/2 mv^2 where m is the mass of the\r\nbody and v the velocity. The resistance of a substance to penetration\r\nof a body is expressed by the formula A f_c where A is the area of the\r\nbody in contact with the resisting medium and f_c is the coefficient\r\nof sliding friction between the penetrating body and the resisting\r\nmedium. Consider first the space flyer. To hold personnel the flyer\r\nmust be hollow. In other words, m must be small as compared to A. A\r\nmeteor, on the other hand, is solid and dense with a relatively large\r\nm and small A. Given a meteor and a space flyer of the same weight,\r\nthe volume of the meteor would be much smaller, and as the area in\r\ncontact with the resisting medium is a function of volume, the total\r\nresistance to be overcome by the space flyer would be much greater\r\nthan that to be overcome by the meteor. Again, consider the relative\r\nvelocities of a meteor and a space flyer coming from the earth toward\r\nthe heaviside layer. The meteor from space would have an enormous\r\nvelocity, so great that if it got into even very rare air, it would\r\nbecome incandescent. As it must go through dense air, the space flyer\r\ncould attain only a relatively low velocity before it reached the\r\nlayer. Remember that the velocity is squared. A one thousand pound\r\nmeteor flying with a velocity 100 times that of the space ship would\r\nhave 100^2 or 10,000 times the kinetic energy of the space ship while\r\nit would also have less friction to overcome due to its smaller size.\r\n\r\nIf my critic wishes to test this out for himself, I can suggest a very\r\nsimple experiment. Take a plank of sound pine wood, two inches thick\r\nby twelve inches wide and four feet long. Support it on both ends and\r\nthen pile lead slabs onto it, covering the whole area of the board. If\r\nthe wood be sound the board will support a thousand pounds readily.\r\nNow remove the lead slabs and fire a 200 grain lead bullet at the\r\nboard with a muzzle or initial velocity of 1,600 feet per second. The\r\nbullet will penetrate the board very readily. Consider the heaviside\r\nlayer as the board, the space ship as the lead slabs and the bullet as\r\nthe meteor and you have the answer.\r\n\r\nConsider one more thing. According to the stories, the layer grew\r\nthicker and harder to penetrate as the flyer reached the outer\r\nsurface. The meteor would strike the most viscous part of the layer\r\nwith its maximum energy. As its velocity dropped and its kinetic\r\nenergy grew less, it would meet material easier to penetrate. On the\r\nother hand the flyer, coming from the earth, would meet material easy\r\nto penetrate and gradually lose its velocity and consequently its\r\nkinetic energy. When it reached the very viscous portion of the layer,\r\nit would have almost no energy left with which to force its way\r\nthrough. Remember, the Mercurians made no attempt to penetrate the\r\nlayer until a portion of it had been destroyed by Carpenter's genius.\r\n\r\nAs for the matter of refraction. If you will place a glass cube or\r\nother form in the air, you will have no difficulty in measuring the\r\nrefraction of the light passing through it. If, however, the observer\r\nwould place himself inside a hollow sphere of glass so perfectly\r\ntransparent as to be invisible, would not the refraction he would\r\nobserve be taken by him to be the refraction of air when in reality it\r\nwould be the combined refraction of the glass sphere and the air\r\naround him?\r\n\r\nI have taken glass as the medium to illustrate this because my critic\r\nmade the statement that \"a substance denser than air would produce\r\nrefraction that would have been noticed long ago.\" However nowhere in\r\neither story is the statement made that the material of the heaviside\r\nlayer was denser than air. The statement was that it was more viscous.\r\nViscosity is not necessarily a function of density. A heavy oil such\r\nas you use in the winter to lubricate your automobile has a much\r\nhigher viscosity than water, yet it will float on water, i. e. it is\r\nless dense. There is nothing in the story that would prevent the\r\nheaviside layer from having a coefficient of refraction identical with\r\nthat of air.\r\n\r\nTo close, let me repeat that I am not arguing that such a layer\r\nexists. I do not believe that it does and I do believe that my\r\ngeneration will probably see the first interplanetary expedition start\r\nand possibly see the first interplanetary trip succeed. I do, however,\r\ncontend that the science in my stories is accurate until it transcends\r\nthe boundaries of present day knowledge and ceases to be science and\r\nbecomes \"super-science,\" and that my super-science is developed in a\r\nlogical manner from science and that nothing in present knowledge\r\nmakes the existence of such a layer impossible--S. P. Meek. Capt. Ord.\r\nDept., U. S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Likes Long Novelettes_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nI have just finished reading the August issue of your magazine. I am\r\ngoing to rate the different stories in per cents. 100% means\r\nexcellent; 75% fairly good; 50% passable; 25% just an ordinary story.\r\n\r\nI give \"Marooned Under The Sea,\" by Paul Ernst, 100%; 75% for \"The\r\nAttack From Space,\" by Captain S. P. Meek. \"The Problem in\r\nCommunication,\" by Miles J. Breuer, M. D. and \"Jetta of the Lowlands,\"\r\nby Ray Cummings; 50% for \"The Murder Machine,\" by Hugh B. Cave and\r\n\"Earth, The Marauder,\" by Arthur J. Burks; 25% for \"The Terrible\r\nTentacles of L-472,\" by Sewell Peaslee Wright.\r\n\r\nI am happy to say that since I have been reading your magazine, I have\r\ninduced at least ten of my friends to be constant readers of this\r\nmagazine.\r\n\r\nI like the long novelettes much better than continued novels, and hope\r\nthat in the future we will get bigger and better novelettes.--Leonard\r\nEstrin, 1145 Morrison Ave., Bronx, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hasn't Decided_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nMove over, you old-timers, and let a newcomer say something.\r\n\r\nA few months ago I didn't read any Science Fiction. Now I read it all.\r\nI haven't decided yet which magazine I like best.\r\n\r\nI was a little disappointed when you didn't have another story in the\r\nSeptember copy by R. P. Starzl, who wrote \"Planet of Dread.\" I thought\r\nyou would hold on to a good author when you find one.\r\n\r\nI would also like another story by the fellow who wrote the serial\r\n\"Murder Madness.\"\r\n\r\nI like short stories best.\r\n\r\nThat idea of a mechanical nirvana in Miles J. Breuer's story was good.\r\n\r\n\"Jetta of the Lowlands?\" Opinion reserved. I like the action of the\r\nstory, but I hate a hero who is always bragging about himself.\r\n\r\nDon't think I'm complaining, but nothing is perfect.\r\n\r\nWhy not try to get a story of A. Merritt's, or Ralph Milne\r\nFarley's?--A. Dougherty, 327 North Prairie Ave., Sioux Falls, So. Dak.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Announcement_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nMay I enter \"The Readers' Corner\" to announce that a branch of The\r\nScienceers has recently been formed in Clearwater, Florida, by a group\r\nof Science Fiction enthusiasts?\r\n\r\nWe have a library of 175 Science Fiction magazines, including a\r\ncomplete file of Astounding Stories to date. We hold weekly meetings\r\nat which scientific topics are discussed, and current Science Fiction\r\nstories commented upon.\r\n\r\nAs the first branch of The Scienceers, we are striving to achieve a\r\nsuccess that will be a mark for other branches to aim at.--Carlton\r\nAbernathy, P. O. Box 584, Clearwater, Fla.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From Merrie England_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nI came across your May publication of Astounding Stories the other\r\nday, and I cannot resist writing to you to congratulate you on the\r\nmost interesting magazine I have ever read. I am now determined to\r\ntake it every month. Re \"The Atom Smasher,\" it is A-1. I have read\r\nseveral interplanetary stories over here but none to touch those of\r\nyour magazine.\r\n\r\nBest wishes for the success of your book and its authors.--J. C.\r\nAtkinson, 17 Balaclava Rd., Sheffield, England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Starting Young_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nYou'll excuse my writing, for it is the end of vacation.\r\n\r\nI like your book very much, which many other readers approve of. Some\r\ndislikes, of course, everyone has, and I have three which many readers\r\nhave, too. First, I wish the magazine were bigger and the paper\r\nbetter. Second, have more stories and raise the price to 25c. Third,\r\nhave stories of the future such as \"Earth, the Marauder,\" and stories\r\nof lost Atlantis, the fourth dimension, other planets, atoms and\r\nelectrons.--Jack Farber, Payette, Idaho.\r\n\r\nP. S. I am 11 years old and interested in science.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Doesn't Like Serials_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nI am a recent reader of the Astounding Stories magazine. I am going to\r\nkeep getting the magazine, as I like it very much.\r\n\r\nI did not like \"Murder Madness,\" or Burks' \"Earth, the Marauder\" very\r\nmuch. I do not think \"Murder Madness\" is the type of story that\r\nbelongs in this magazine. I do not like continued stories very much as\r\nI hate to break off at an interesting point and wait a whole month\r\nbefore I can read the next installment or conclusion of the story. The\r\nfront piece of the magazine is very good, and except for the\r\ncriticisms mentioned above the magazine is excellent.--Kempt Mitchell.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Staunch Defender_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nAt one time a friend introduced your excellent little publication to\r\nme. I read it and enjoyed every paragraph of it. This issue starred\r\n\"The Monsters of Moyen,\" which I consider a real super-science story.\r\nI have followed \"The Readers' Corner\" quite a time.\r\n\r\nIn the September issue I saw where someone made a commentary on the\r\nmagazine. One of the things they said was that the paper should be of\r\na better grade. It is true that this would help, but \"our\" magazine is\r\nnot half full of advertisements to pay for this expense. Dear friends,\r\nthis is no Saturday Evening Post. Don't ask too much. Then, you may\r\ntake in consideration that other magazines of Science Fiction have no\r\nbetter grade of paper than this, for I have purchased several.\r\n\r\nI have but one thing to say as an improvement for it. That is, why\r\nshouldn't there be a Quarterly? Other Science Fiction magazines have\r\nthem. They have complete stories and are double in size and price.\r\nDear Editor, please, for the public's sake, put out a Quarterly. I'm\r\nsure others would like one.--H. C. Kaufman, Jr., 1730 N. Monroe St.,\r\nBaltimore, Maryland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Announcement_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nWe would appreciate it very much if you would print this in your\r\n\"Readers' Corner\" department.\r\n\r\nWe wish to inform the readers of Astounding Stories of an organization\r\nlately formed, called The Boys' Scientifiction Club. Its purpose is to\r\npromote scientific interest among boys between the ages of 10 and 15,\r\nto encourage the reading of Science Fiction and scientific works, and\r\nto create a bond of friendship among them.\r\n\r\nA circulating library, composed of Science Fiction books, magazines,\r\narticles, etc., is being constructed to circulate among members who\r\ndesire to read any of the contents.\r\n\r\nOfficers are: President-Librarian, Forrest J. Ackerman, 530 Staples\r\nAve., San Francisco, Cal.; Secretary-Treasurer, Frank Sipos, 174\r\nStaples Ave., San Francisco, California.\r\n\r\nAddress all letters concerning membership to the President. He will be\r\nglad to answer all letters and explain particulars of the club. Thank\r\nyou for your kindness.--Linus Hogenmiller, Vice-President B. S. C.,\r\n502 N. Washington St., Farmington, Missouri.\r\n\r\n\r\n_But--Ray Cummings Writes Us Only Brand New Stories!_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nI want to commend Astounding Stories on carrying out an idea which I\r\nhave had in mind for some time; that is, some scientific articles. \"A\r\nStar That Breathes,\" in the July number, was very interesting, as were\r\nthe two articles in the August copy. However, I hope that this is only\r\nthe start of a valuable new addition to Astounding Stories. There\r\nshould be at least five or six in each magazine, and I think most of\r\nthe readers would prefer them at the end of the stories instead of in\r\nthe back of the magazine. Another thing that is absolutely essential\r\nif Astounding Stories would hold its own as a high-class Science\r\nFiction magazine is a scientific editorial in the front of the book.\r\nThe way it starts off abruptly onto a story gives the impression of a\r\ncheap publication.\r\n\r\nA lot of your readers have been setting up a clamor for stories by Ray\r\nCummings. While it is true that he has written a few good stories, you\r\nwill find that his antiquated stuff is not being printed in any of the\r\nother Science Fiction magazine, but only in ones devoted to\r\nadventure-stories. For the sake of your many readers who would like to\r\nsee \"our magazine\" keep abreast of the times, Cummings should be\r\ndropped and some of the peerless authors of to-day employed. As an\r\nadvance along this line you already have Capt. S. P. Meek, Harl\r\nVincent, Lilith Lorraine, Edmond Hamilton, and, in the latest copy, R.\r\nF. Starzl. \"The Planet of Dread,\" by R. F. Starzl was the best story\r\nin the August issue. A wealth of ideas was contained in that treatise\r\nof life on a young, warm planet, and the idea of fooling the liquid\r\nintelligence by thought-suggestion is quite novel but entirely\r\nreasonable. Mr. Starzl is an author of the highest type and ability,\r\nand you will do well to secure more stories from his typewriter.\r\n\r\nI was glad to see that the cover has finally been changed from the\r\nconventional blue background, and I hope we will have a little\r\nvariation from now on. Concerning illustrations, Wesso is a great\r\nartist, and aside from a few scientific errors his covers are\r\nexcellent. The inside drawings could be improved, however.\r\n\r\nI hope for your continued success--Wayne D. Bray, Campbell, Mo.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Are We All \"Morons?\"_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nHaving perused three issues of your magazine, I must agree that its\r\ntitle is well chosen. The stories are nearly all \"astounding\";\r\nastounding in that they utterly ignore every scientific fact and\r\ndiscovery of the past ten centuries.\r\n\r\nThe cold of inter-stellar space; its lack of oxygen; the\r\ninterplanetary effects of gravitation--all are passed over as if\r\nnon-existent.\r\n\r\nAn \"anti-gravity ovoid\"--of which no description is given--if worn in\r\na man's hat, makes his whole body weightless.\r\n\r\nMen, buildings and cities float through the air or become invisible,\r\nyet not the least semi-scientific explanation is made as to the how of\r\nit all.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the pattern of your stories appears to have been taken\r\nfrom the Arabian Nights and from Grimm's Fairy Tales--but with not a\r\nmillionth part of the interest.\r\n\r\nHow anyone, save a young child or a moron, can read and enjoy such\r\nfutile nonsense is incredible.\r\n\r\nIf your writers would (like Jules Verne) only invent some\r\npseudo-scientific explanation for their marvels, your publication\r\nmight then be read with pleasure--but why do so when trash is\r\nacceptable without thought behind it!--M. Clifford Johnston, 451\r\nCentral Avenue, Newark, N. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Wesso Fan_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nLet me congratulate you on the September issue of Astounding Stories.\r\nIt is the best issue you have published yet. I noticed in this issue\r\nthat you had four illustrations by Wesso. Though that is the most you\r\nhave ever had, I think it would be much better if all the\r\nillustrations were by him.\r\n\r\nHowever, getting down to brass tacks, the reason I'm typing this\r\nletter is to ask you to publish an Astounding Stories Quarterly. You\r\ncould have it contain twice as much reading material as in the monthly\r\nand charge forty cents a copy for it. It would be much better than a\r\nsemi-monthly and I am quite sure it would \"go over\" big.--Thomas L.\r\nKratzer, 3593 Tullamore Rd., University Heights, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bang--Bang--Bang_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nI have read the August Astounding Stories and greatly enjoyed the\r\nfiction, but \"The Readers' Corner\" gave me a good deal of amusement.\r\nSome of your readers take their fiction so seriously!\r\n\r\nTake the \"Brick or Two\" from George L. Williams and Harry Heillisan,\r\nfor instance. They want Astounding Stories filled with material from\r\nauthors that appear in other magazines--because your readers \"are used\r\nto the standards set by those publications,\" etc. And again, \"you\r\nshould have some one who is well qualified to pass upon the science in\r\nthe stories.\" For the love of Pete, if people want scientific\r\ntreatises, why don't they buy books and magazines dealing with the\r\nsubject? There are many on the market--serious and dull enough for\r\nanyone. But for our fiction magazines, let's have it pure and\r\nunadulterated, the more improbably the better.\r\n\r\nWhat possible difference does it make if, in a story, the moon has a\r\ncrater every ten feet, or the black sky of outer space were blazing\r\nwith moons and aurora borealises, or the sun were in a double eclipse!\r\n\r\nWe read stories to be amused, not for technical information, so we\r\ncertainly don't want \"a scientific editorial in each issue by some\r\n'eminent scientist.'\"\r\n\r\nAs for a department in which readers could write their opinions of the\r\nstories and suggest improvements in the conduct of the magazine, what\r\nelse is \"The Readers' Corner?\"\r\n\r\nWhy not adopt a tolerant attitude, and instead of howling about petty\r\nfaults and mistakes get a good laugh over them? As for telling writers\r\nand editors \"how to do it,\" we would only expose our ignorance and\r\ninability and make ourselves ridiculous.\r\n\r\nIf we think we could do so much better, let's try it. Write a story\r\nourselves or start running a magazine!\r\n\r\nAstounding Stories is all right as is. We like it \"different.\" We want\r\ndifferent authors from those of other magazines. What is the use of\r\nhaving various publications if they must all be conducted along\r\nidentical lines?\r\n\r\nNow for your writers: Mr. R.F. Starzl is easily the best. His story,\r\n\"The Planet of Dread,\" is full of thrills and imagination and clever\r\nsituations that are well developed and surmounted. One thing that is\r\nrather remarkable in this class of story, the hero gets himself and\r\nhis companion out of every difficulty by his own ingenuity. The story\r\nmoves along with interest and thrills in every paragraph, and is\r\nreally my ideal of a \"super-scientific\" yarn; i.e., not stuffed with\r\ntiresome technical data. Let's have more from this interesting\r\nauthor.--C.E. Bush, Decatur, Ark.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Assorted Bouquets_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nBefore commenting upon the September issue of your wonderful magazine,\r\nI would like to personally thank Mr. Bates for the kind reply to my\r\nformer letter. It shows that at least one editor glanced over my\r\nliterary ramblings.\r\n\r\nNow for comments on the September issue. I placed the stories in the\r\nfollowing order, which is based upon their merit:\r\n\r\n\"Marooned Under the Sea\"; \"Terrible Tentacles of L-472\"; \"Jetta of the\r\nLowlands\"; \"The Attack from Space\"; \"A Problem in Communication\";\r\n\"Earth the Marauder,\" and \"The Murder Machine.\"\r\n\r\nYour serials are the best I have ever read in any magazine; your\r\nlatest one, \"Jetta of the Lowlands,\" promises to be an A-1\r\ntop-notcher.\r\n\r\nYour artists, H.W. Wessolowski and J. Fleming Gould, draw the finest\r\nillustrations I have ever seen anywhere.\r\n\r\n\"The Readers' Corner\" is a fine corner which can only be improved by\r\nmaking it larger.\r\n\r\nThe stories scheduled for the October issue look good to me. Am glad\r\nto see that Dr. Bird is returning. Will sign off now wishing\r\nAstounding Stories all the luck it deserves.--Edwin Anderson, 1765\r\nSouthern Boulevard, Bronx, N.Y.C., N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Request_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nI thought I would drop you just a line to comment on the authors now\r\nwriting for \"our\" magazine.\r\n\r\nAmong the best are: R. F. Starzl, Edmond Hamilton, Harl Vincent, Ray\r\nCummings and Captain S. P. Meek. However, there is one brilliant\r\nauthor whose fascinating stories have, to date, failed to appear in\r\nour magazine. The man I am referring to is Ed Earl Repp. Please have a\r\nstory by him in our magazine as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI am sure other readers will agree with me when I say that Mr. Repp\r\nwrites exceedingly thrilling and exciting Science Fiction tales. Let's\r\nsee many stories by him in the forthcoming issues of Astounding\r\nStories.--Forrest J. Ackerman, 530 Staples Avenue, San Francisco,\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thank You, Mr. Lorenzo_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nSeveral Science Fiction magazines will have to struggle along without\r\nmy patronage. Why? Because they flew (literally speaking) over my head\r\nwith all kinds of science. I want some science, but mostly fiction. I\r\ncouldn't understand what they were writing about, so I lost interest.\r\nI can read a single copy of a good magazine from cover to cover in one\r\nday, but let me lose interest in it by having too much dry matter and\r\nI just don't buy that book again.\r\n\r\nYour magazine is the best of all Science Fiction magazines, which\r\nmeans that I can read and understand the tales in Astounding Stories.\r\nSo you get my trade. You're trying your best to supply me with\r\ninteresting stories so if there is an occasional dry story (to me), I\r\njust remember one thing: you, as Editor, are a human being like\r\nmyself; so, neither one of us being perfect, I just forgive and go on\r\nbuying.--Jas Lorenzo, 644 Hanover St., San Francisco, Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suggestions_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\n\"Earth, the Marauder,\" by Arthur J. Burks, gets four stars. It is one\r\nof the most astounding stories I have ever read. I hope you have more\r\nstories by Arthur J. Burks on schedule for early issues. \"Jetta of the\r\nLowlands,\" by Ray Cummings, \"Marooned Under the Sea,\" by Paul Ernst (a\r\nsequel soon, I hope). \"The Terrible Tentacles of L-472,\" by S.P.\r\nWright and \"The Attack from Space,\" by S.P. Meek (let's have another\r\nsequel), all get three stars. I hope that S.P. Wright will write more\r\nstories of strange planets.\r\n\r\nI think that your serials should all be book-length novels with the\r\ninstallments from thirty-five to fifty pages in length. Don't publish\r\nnovelettes (thirty to sixty-five pages) as serials.\r\n\r\nIn your August issue you mention that you may some day publish\r\nAstounding Stories twice a month. I would rather have you increase the\r\nprice to twenty-five cents, give us as much material as Five Novels\r\nMonthly, and smooth cut edges.\r\n\r\nWesso's cover illustrations are improving each month. I am glad to see\r\nmore of his illustrations inside.\r\n\r\nSince so many readers ask for reprints, why not give us an occasional\r\none?--Jack Darrow, 4225 N. Spaulding Ave., Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_A Flop_\"\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nI have read Astounding Stories since its first issue, and I am\r\nconvinced that it is without a peer in the field of Science Fiction.\r\nThis preeminence is due to the fact that the magazine regularly\r\ncontains the work of the best contemporary writers of scientific\r\nfantasy, such as Cummings, Rousseau, Leinster, Burks and Hamilton.\r\n\r\nCertain readers, unaccustomed to such rich fare, ask for stories by\r\nlesser lights. For a time these requests went unheeded; but of late it\r\nseems they are getting results--more's the pity.\r\n\r\nYour September issue contained a story called \"A Problem in\r\nCommunication\" by Miles J. Breuer, M.D. Now, the good doctor may be a\r\n\"wow\" in other magazines, but his stuff is not up to the standard of\r\nAstounding Stories. His initial effort in this magazine was dull and\r\nuninspired. It lacked the sustained interest and gripping action of\r\nyour other stories. It was, to put it bluntly, a flop.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this sad example, several readers are still clamoring for\r\nmore stuff from the small-timers. If they get their way--which Allah\r\nforbid!--it will mean the downfall of Astounding Stories. Why ruin a\r\ntruly great magazine by catering to a misguided minority?--George K.\r\nAddison, 94 Brandt Place, Bronx, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_No Favorites_\"\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nI found your magazine on the newsstand while looking for another kind.\r\nThe cover picture looked interesting so I bought Astounding Stories\r\ninstead of the other. Since that moment I have been a steady reader.\r\n\r\nI can see no way to improve your magazine unless it is to enlarge it\r\nor to publish it oftener. I am satisfied with it as it is. It is the\r\nbest magazine on the newsstands now.\r\n\r\nI have no favorites among your stories as I like them all equally\r\nwell.--Robert L. King, Melbourne, Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pride of the Regiment_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nI have just finished reading the September issue of Astounding Stories\r\nand want to congratulate you on your staff of writers. Although this\r\nis the first copy I have read, I can assure you that it will not be\r\nthe last, by any means.\r\n\r\nI think the story called \"Marooned Under the Sea,\" by Paul Ernst, a\r\nstory that no one could have passed without reading it. The way the\r\nauthor explains the story to have come to life has really got me\r\nguessing.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that I regretted was that I didn't get the copies\r\nprevious to the story called, \"Earth, the Marauder,\" by Arthur J.\r\nBurks. Please give us more stories by Paul Ernst. (I say us because I\r\nam a soldier, and where you find one soldier you find plenty\r\nsoldiers.)\r\n\r\nSo keep the good work up, as we are looking forward to a good time\r\nwhen the next issues come around.--Co. \"I,\" 26th Inf. Plattsburgh\r\nBarracks, Plattsburgh, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Covers Not Too Vivid_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nI can't help joining the great number of admirers of your wonderful\r\nmagazine.\r\n\r\nA great many readers ask for interplanetary stories. As for me, I like\r\nany kind, stories of other worlds, under the earth, under the sea, on\r\nother planets, dimensional stories, anything. So far I have not had\r\nthe slightest excuse to complain.\r\n\r\nWhen I finish reading a story I write after the title, \"good,\" \"very\r\ngood,\" \"fair,\" etc. Then I read the best ones over again while waiting\r\nfor the next issue. The following two and the only stories I didn't\r\nlike so far are: \"The Stolen Mind\" and \"Creatures of the Light.\"\r\n\r\nOne critic stated that he considered the illustrations of Astounding\r\nStories too vivid. Illustrations for stories such as are contained in\r\nthis magazine cannot be too vivid. Readers have plenty of opportunity\r\nto use their imaginations. Many scenes which the authors try to\r\nportray are hard to visualize, and I think that a number of good\r\nillustrations would help the readers enjoy the stories more.\r\n\r\nAs long as you keep your magazine up to the standard you have set thus\r\nfar, I will remain an eager reader.--Sam Castellina, 104 E. Railroad\r\nSt. Pittston, Penn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quite True_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nI have enjoyed every one of your Astounding Stories magazines from the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the story, \"The Murder Machine,\" by Hugh B. Cave, a man,\r\nSir John Harman, was made to kill a man by meccano-telepathically\r\nprojected hypnotic suggestions. Some people think it is entirely\r\npossible to make a man do such a thing by hypnotism, but it is not\r\npossible because no person under hypnotic influence will do anything\r\nthat his subconscious mind knows is immoral. Neither a thief nor a\r\nmurderer can be made to confess their crime while under hypnotic\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nI am merely writing this so that the others who have read the story\r\nwill not get the wrong idea of hypnotism. A man under hypnotic\r\ninfluence can be made to think he is murdering or robbing, but he will\r\nnot do it really, no matter how hard the hypnotist tries to make\r\nhim.--Henry Booth, 916 Federal St., N. S. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Paper Correct Kind_\"\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\nI am a reader of four other Science Fiction magazines but like\r\nAstounding Stories the best for two main reasons. First, the size is\r\njust right, second, the paper is the correct kind. It does not glare\r\nat you when you read.\r\n\r\nI have every issue of Astounding Stories since it came out. The\r\nstories are all good and are becoming better each month. I prefer\r\nstories of space traveling and of the fourth dimension.\r\n\r\nAbout reprints, I think that if you want to give reprints, why not\r\npublish them in booklet form. I'm sure many of the readers will prefer\r\nto have reprints that way.--Frank Wogavoda, Water Mill, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bouquets_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\n\"The Planet of Dread\" was a classic in the full meaning of the word.\r\nNot only was the story a masterpiece of fantastic adventure but also\r\nof short story craft. By all means secure more of Mr. Starzl's fine\r\ntales.\r\n\r\nYour stories by Ray Cummings are great. It would be a good policy upon\r\nyour part to continue to present stories of his at the most not more\r\nthan two issues apart.\r\n\r\nContinue up to your present standard and you'll continue to stand\r\nabove all other Science Fiction magazines where stories of\r\nsuper-science are concerned, now and forever.--Jerome Siegel, 10622\r\nKimberley Ave., Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_The Readers' Corner_\"\r\n\r\nAll Readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come\r\nover in 'The Readers' Corner'\" and join in our monthly discussion of\r\nstories, authors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything\r\nthat's of common interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\r\n\r\nAlthough from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this\r\nis a department primarily for _Readers_, and we want you to make full\r\nuse of it.
