Naturally many suggestions as\r\nto changes, additions, and other improvements have reached its authors.\r\nNaturally, too, the authors have busied themselves in devising methods\r\nto add to the effectiveness of the book. Some additions have been made\r\nalmost every year since the book was published. To embody all these\r\nchanges and helpful suggestions into a strictly unified volume; to add\r\nsome further topics and sections; to bring all farm practices up to the\r\nideals of to-day; to include the most recent teaching of scientific\r\ninvestigators--these were the objects sought in the thorough revision\r\nwhich has just been given the book. The authors hope and think that the\r\nremaking of the book has added to its usefulness and attractiveness.\r\n\r\nThey believe now, as they believed before, that there is no line of\r\nseparation between the science of agriculture and the practical art of\r\nagriculture. They are assured by the success of this book that\r\nagriculture is eminently a teachable subject. They see no difference\r\nbetween teaching the child the fundamental principles of farming and\r\nteaching the same child the fundamental truths of arithmetic, geography,\r\nor grammar. They hold that a youth should be trained for the farm just\r\nas carefully as he is trained for any other occupation, and that it is\r\nunreasonable to expect him to succeed without training.\r\n\r\nIf they are right in these views, the training must begin in the public\r\nschools. This is true for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It is universally admitted that aptitudes are developed, tastes\r\nacquired, and life habits formed during the years that a child is in the\r\npublic school. Hence, during these important years every child intended\r\nfor the farm should be taught to know and love nature, should be led to\r\nform habits of observation, and should be required to begin a study of\r\nthose great laws upon which agriculture is based. A training like this\r\ngoes far toward making his life-work profitable and delightful.\r\n\r\n2. Most boys and girls reared on a farm get no educational training\r\nexcept that given in the public schools. If, then, the truths that\r\nunlock the doors of nature are not taught in the public schools, nature\r\nand nature's laws will always be hid in night to a majority of our\r\nbread-winners. They must still in ignorance and hopeless drudgery tear\r\ntheir bread from a reluctant soil.\r\n\r\nThe authors return hearty thanks to Professor Thomas F. Hunt, University\r\nof California; Professor Augustine D. Selby, Ohio Experiment Station;\r\nProfessor W. F. Massey, horticulturist and agricultural writer; and\r\nProfessor Franklin Sherman, Jr., State Entomologist of North Carolina,\r\nfor aid in proofreading and in the preparation of some of the material.\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.

By the same reasoning they might hesitate to teach\r\narithmetic because they do not know calculus or to teach a primary\r\nhistory of the United States because they are not versed in all history.\r\nThe art of farming is based on the sciences dealing with the growth of\r\nplants and animals. This book presents in a simple way these fundamental\r\nscientific truths and suggests some practices drawn from them. Hence,\r\neven though many teachers may not have plowed or sowed or harvested,\r\nsuch teachers need not be embarrassed in mastering and heartily\r\ninstructing a class in nature's primary laws.\r\n\r\nIf teachers realize how much the efficiency, comfort, and happiness of\r\ntheir pupils will be increased throughout their lives from being taught\r\nto cooeperate with nature and to take advantage of her wonderful laws,\r\nthey will eagerly begin this study. They will find also that their\r\npupils will be actively interested in these studies bearing on their\r\ndaily lives, and this interest will be carried over to other subjects.\r\nWhenever you can, take the pupils into the field, the garden, the\r\norchard, and the dairy. Teach them to make experiments and to learn by\r\nthe use of their own eyes and brains. They will, if properly led,\r\nastonish you by their efforts and growth.\r\n\r\nYou will find in the practical exercises many suggestions as to\r\nexperiments that you can make with your class or with individual\r\nmembers. Do not neglect this first-hand teaching. It will be a delight\r\nto your pupils. In many cases it will be best to finish the experiments\r\nor observational work first, and later turn to the text to amplify the\r\npupil's knowledge.\r\n\r\nAlthough the book is arranged in logical order, the teacher ought to\r\nfeel free to teach any topic in the season best suited to its study.\r\nOmit any chapter or section that does not bear on your crops or does not\r\ndeal with conditions in your state.\r\n\r\nThe United States government and the different state experiment stations\r\npublish hundreds of bulletins on agricultural subjects. These are sent\r\nwithout cost, on application. It will be very helpful to get such of\r\nthese bulletins as bear on the different sections of the book. These\r\nwill be valuable additions to your school library. The authors would\r\nlike to give a list of these bulletins bearing on each chapter, but it\r\nwould soon be out of date, for the bulletins get out of print and are\r\nsupplanted by newer ones. However, the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture prints a monthly list of its publications, and each state\r\nexperiment station keeps a list of its bulletins. A note to the\r\nSecretary of Agriculture, Washington, D.C., or to your own state\r\nexperiment station will promptly bring you these lists, and from them\r\nyou can select what you need for your school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE FOR BEGINNERS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I. ORIGIN OF THE SOIL\r\n\r\nThe word _soil_ occurs many times in this little book. In agriculture\r\nthis word is used to describe the thin layer of surface earth that, like\r\nsome great blanket, is tucked around the wrinkled and age-beaten form of\r\nour globe. The harder and colder earth under this surface layer is\r\ncalled the _subsoil_. It should be noted, however, that in waterless and\r\nsun-dried regions there seems little difference between the soil and the\r\nsubsoil.\r\n\r\nPlants, insects, birds, beasts, men,--all alike are fed on what grows in\r\nthis thin layer of soil. If some wild flood in sudden wrath could sweep\r\ninto the ocean this earth-wrapping soil, food would soon become as\r\nscarce as it was in Samaria when mothers ate their sons. The face of the\r\nearth as we now see it, daintily robed in grass, or uplifting waving\r\nacres of corn, or even naked, water-scarred, and disfigured by man's\r\nneglect, is very different from what it was in its earliest days. How\r\nwas it then? How was the soil formed?\r\n\r\nLearned men think that at first the surface of the earth was solid rock.\r\nHow was this rock changed into workable soil? Occasionally a curious boy\r\npicks up a rotten stone, squeezes it, and finds his hands filled with\r\ndirt, or soil. Now, just as the boy crumbled with his fingers this\r\nsingle stone, the great forces of nature with boundless patience\r\ncrumbled, or, as it is called, disintegrated, the early rock mass. The\r\nsimple but giant-strong agents that beat the rocks into powder with a\r\nclublike force a millionfold more powerful than the club force of\r\nHercules were chiefly (1) heat and cold; (2) water, frost, and ice; (3)\r\na very low form of vegetable life; and (4) tiny animals--if such minute\r\nbodies can be called animals. In some cases these forces acted singly;\r\nin others, all acted together to rend and crumble the unbroken stretch\r\nof rock. Let us glance at some of the methods used by these skilled\r\nsoil-makers.\r\n\r\nHeat and cold are working partners. You already know that most hot\r\nbodies shrink, or contract, on cooling. The early rocks were hot. As the\r\noutside shell of rock cooled from exposure to air and moisture it\r\ncontracted. This shrinkage of the rigid rim of course broke many of the\r\nrocks, and here and there left cracks, or fissures. In these fissures\r\nwater collected and froze. As freezing water expands with irresistible\r\npower, the expansion still further broke the rocks to pieces. The\r\nsmaller pieces again, in the same way, were acted on by frost and ice\r\nand again crumbled. This process is still a means of soil-formation.\r\n\r\nRunning water was another giant soil-former. If you would understand its\r\naction, observe some usually sparkling stream just after a washing rain.\r\nThe clear waters are discolored by mud washed in from the surrounding\r\nhills. As though disliking their muddy burden, the waters strive to\r\nthrow it off. Here, as low banks offer chance, they run out into\r\nshallows and drop some of it. Here, as they pass a quiet pool, they\r\ndeposit more. At last they reach the still water at the mouth of the\r\nstream, and there they leave behind the last of their mud load, and\r\noften form of it little three-sided islands called _deltas_. In the same\r\nway mighty rivers like the Amazon, the Mississippi, and the Hudson, when\r\nthey are swollen by rain, bear great quantities of soil in their sweep\r\nto the seas. Some of the soil they scatter over the lowlands as they\r\nwhirl seaward; the rest they deposit in deltas at their mouths. It is\r\nestimated that the Mississippi carries to the ocean each year enough\r\nsoil to cover a square mile of surface to a depth of two hundred and\r\nsixty-eight feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. ROCK MARKED BY THE SCRAPING OF A GLACIER OVER IT]\r\n\r\nThe early brooks and rivers, instead of bearing mud, ran oceanward\r\neither bearing ground stone that they themselves had worn from the rocks\r\nby ceaseless fretting, or bearing stones that other forces had already\r\ndislodged. The large pieces were whirled from side to side and beaten\r\nagainst one another or against bedrock until they were ground into\r\nsmaller and smaller pieces. The rivers distributed this rock soil just\r\nas the later rivers distribute muddy soil. For ages the moving waters\r\nground against the rocks. Vast were the waters; vast the number of\r\nyears; vast the results.\r\n\r\nGlaciers were another soil-producing agent. Glaciers are streams \"frozen\r\nand moving slowly but irresistibly onwards, down well-defined valleys,\r\ngrinding and pulverizing the rock masses detached by the force and\r\nweight of their attack.\" Where and how were these glaciers formed?\r\n\r\nOnce a great part of upper North America was a vast sheet of ice.\r\nWhatever moisture fell from the sky fell as snow. No one knows what made\r\nthis long winter of snow, but we do know that snows piled on snows until\r\nmountains of white were built up. The lower snow was by the pressure of\r\nthat above it packed into ice masses. By and by some change of climate\r\ncaused the masses of ice to break up somewhat and to move south and\r\nwest. These moving masses, carrying rock and frozen earth, ground them\r\nto powder. King thus describes the stately movement of these snow\r\nmountains: \"Beneath the bottom of this slowly moving sheet of ice, which\r\nwith more or less difficulty kept itself conformable with the face of\r\nthe land over which it was riding, the sharper outstanding points were\r\ncut away and the deeper river canons filled in. Desolate and rugged\r\nrocky wastes were thrown down and spread over with rich soil.\"\r\n\r\nThe joint action of air, moisture, and frost was still another agent of\r\nsoil-making. This action is called _weathering_. Whenever you have\r\nnoticed the outside stones of a spring-house, you have noticed that tiny\r\nbits are crumbling from the face of the stones, and adding little by\r\nlittle to the soil. This is a slow way of making additions to the soil.\r\nIt is estimated that it would take 728,000 years to wear away limestone\r\nrock to a depth of thirty-nine inches. But when you recall the\r\ncountless years through which the weather has striven against the rocks,\r\nyou can readily understand that its never-wearying activity has added\r\nimmensely to the soil.\r\n\r\nIn the rock soil formed in these various ways, and indeed on the rocks\r\nthemselves, tiny plants that live on food taken from the air began to\r\ngrow. They grew just as you now see mosses and lichens grow on the\r\nsurface of rocks. The decay of these plants added some fertility to the\r\nnewly formed soil. The life and death of each succeeding generation of\r\nthese lowly plants added to the soil matter accumulating on the rocks.\r\nSlowly but unceasingly the soil increased in depth until higher\r\nvegetable forms could flourish and add their dead bodies to it. This\r\nvegetable addition to the soil is generally known as _humus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. GROUND ROCK AT END OF A GLACIER]\r\n\r\nIn due course of time low forms of animal life came to live on these\r\nplants, and in turn by their work and their death to aid in making a\r\nsoil fit for the plowman.\r\n\r\nThus with a deliberation that fills man with awe, the powerful forces of\r\nnature splintered the rocks, crumbled them, filled them with plant food,\r\nand turned their flinty grains into a soft, snug home for vegetable\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II. TILLAGE OF THE SOIL\r\n\r\nA good many years ago a man by the name of Jethro Tull lived in England.\r\nHe was a farmer and a most successful man in every way. He first taught\r\nthe English people and the world the value of thorough tillage of the\r\nsoil. Before and during his time farmers did not till the soil very\r\nintelligently. They simply prepared the seed-bed in a careless manner,\r\nas a great many farmers do to-day, and when the crops were gathered the\r\nyields were not large.\r\n\r\nJethro Tull centered attention on the important fact that careful and\r\nthorough tillage increases the available plant food in the soil. He did\r\nnot know why his crops were better when the ground was frequently and\r\nthoroughly tilled, but he knew that such tillage did increase his yield.\r\nHe explained the fact by saying, \"Tillage is manure.\" We have since\r\nlearned the reason for the truth that Tull taught, and, while his\r\nexplanation was incorrect, the practice that he was following was\r\nexcellent. The stirring of the soil enables the air to circulate through\r\nit freely, and permits a breaking down of the compounds that contain the\r\nelements necessary to plant growth.\r\n\r\nYou have seen how the air helps to crumble the stone and brick in old\r\nbuildings. It does the same with soil if permitted to circulate freely\r\nthrough it. The agent of the air that chiefly performs this work is\r\ncalled carbonic acid gas, and this gas is one of the greatest helpers\r\nthe farmer has in carrying on his work. We must not forget that in soil\r\npreparation the air is just as important as any of the tools and\r\nimplements used in cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. SLOPE TO WATER SHOWS SOIL WEATHERED FROM FACE\r\nOF CLIFF]\r\n\r\nIf the soil is fertile and if deep plowing has always been done, good\r\ncrops will result, other conditions being favorable. If, however, the\r\ntillage is poor, scanty harvests will always result. For most soils a\r\ntwo-horse plow is necessary to break up and pulverize the land.\r\n\r\nA shallow soil can always be improved by properly deepening it. The\r\nprinciple of greatest importance in soil-preparation is the gradual\r\ndeepening of the soil in order that plant-roots may have more\r\ncomfortable homes. If the farmer has been accustomed to plow but four\r\ninches deep, he should adjust the plow so as to turn five inches at the\r\nnext plowing, then six, and so on until the seed-bed is nine or ten\r\ninches deep. This gradual deepening will not injure the soil but will\r\nput it quickly in good condition. If to good tillage rotation of crops\r\nbe added, the soil will become more fertile with each succeeding year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. MIXED GRASSES GROWN FOR FORAGE]\r\n\r\nThe plow, harrow, and roller are all necessary to good tillage and to a\r\nproper preparation of the seed-bed. The soil must be made compact and\r\nclods of all sizes must be crushed. Then the air circulates freely, and\r\npaying crops are the rule and not the exception.\r\n\r\nTillage does these things: it increases the plant-food supply, destroys\r\nweeds, and influences the moisture content of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     1. What tools are used in tillage?\r\n\r\n     2. How should a poor and shallow soil be treated?\r\n\r\n     3. Why should a poor and shallow soil be well compacted before\r\n     sowing the crop?\r\n\r\n     4. Explain the value of a circulation of air in the soil.\r\n\r\n     5. What causes iron to rust?\r\n\r\n     6. Why is a two-horse turning-plow better than a one-horse plow?\r\n\r\n     7.

Are earthworms a benefit or an injury to the soil?\r\n\r\n     10. Name three things that tillage does.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III. THE MOISTURE OF THE SOIL\r\n\r\nDid any one ever explain to you how important water is to the soil, or\r\ntell you why it is so important? Often, as you know, crops entirely fail\r\nbecause there is not enough water in the soil for the plants to drink.\r\nHow necessary is it, then, that the soil be kept in the best possible\r\ncondition to catch and hold enough water to carry the plant through dry,\r\nhot spells! Perhaps you are ready to ask, \"How does the mouthless plant\r\ndrink its stored-up water?\"\r\n\r\nThe plant gets all its water through its roots. You have seen the tiny\r\nthreadlike roots of a plant spreading all about in fine soil; they are\r\ndown in the ground taking up plant food and water for the stalk and\r\nleaves above. The water, carrying plant food with it, rises in a simple\r\nbut peculiar way through the roots and stems.\r\n\r\nThe plants use the food for building new tissue, that is, for growth.\r\nThe water passes out through the leaves into the air. When the summers\r\nare dry and hot and there is but little water in the soil, the leaves\r\nshrink up. This is simply a method they have of keeping the water from\r\npassing too rapidly off into the air. I am sure you have seen the corn\r\nblades all shriveled on very hot days. This shrinkage is nature's way of\r\ndiminishing the current of water that is steadily passing through the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nA thrifty farmer will try to keep his soil in such good condition that\r\nit will have a supply of water in it for growing crops when dry and hot\r\nweather comes. He can do this by deep plowing, by subsoiling, by adding\r\nany kind of decaying vegetable matter to the soil, and by growing crops\r\nthat can be tilled frequently.\r\n\r\nThe soil is a great storehouse for moisture. After the clouds have\r\nemptied their waters into this storehouse, the water of the soil comes\r\nto the surface, where it is evaporated into the air. The water comes to\r\nthe surface in just the same way that oil rises in a lamp-wick. This\r\nrising of the water is called _capillarity_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. AN ENLARGED VIEW OF A SECTION OF MOIST SOIL,\r\nSHOWING AIR SPACES AND SOIL PARTICLES]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to understand what is meant by this big word. If into a\r\npan of water you dip a glass tube, the water inside the tube rises above\r\nthe level of the water in the pan. The smaller the tube the higher will\r\nthe water rise. The greater rise inside is perhaps due to the fact that\r\nthe glass attracts the particles of water more than the particles of\r\nwater attract one another. Now apply this principle to the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. THE RIGHT WAY TO PLOW]\r\n\r\nThe soil particles have small spaces between them, and the spaces act\r\njust as the tube does. When the water at the surface is carried away by\r\ndrying winds and warmth, the water deeper in the soil rises through\r\nthe soil spaces. In this way water is brought from its soil storehouse\r\nas plants need it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. APPARATUS FOR TESTING THE HOLDING OF WATER BY\r\nDIFFERENT SOILS]\r\n\r\nOf course when the underground water reaches the surface it evaporates.\r\nIf we want to keep it for our crops, we must prepare a trap to hold it.\r\nNature has shown us how this can be done. Pick up a plank as it lies on\r\nthe ground. Under the plank the soil is wet, while the soil not covered\r\nby the plank is dry. Why? Capillarity brought the water to the surface,\r\nand the plank, by keeping away wind and warmth, acted as a trap to hold\r\nthe moisture. Now of course a farmer cannot set a trap of planks over\r\nhis fields, but he can make a trap of dry earth, and that will do just\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nWhen a crop like corn or cotton or potatoes is cultivated, the fine,\r\nloose dirt stirred by the cultivating-plow will make a mulch that serves\r\nto keep water in the soil in the same way that the plank kept moisture\r\nunder it. The mulch also helps to absorb the rains and prevents the\r\nwater from running off the surface. Frequent cultivation, then, is one\r\nof the best possible ways of saving moisture. Hence the farmer who most\r\nfrequently stirs his soil in the growing season, and especially in\r\nseasons of drought, reaps, other things being equal, a more abundant\r\nharvest than if tillage were neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     1. Why is the soil wet under a board or under straw?\r\n\r\n     2. Will a soil that is fine and compact produce better crops than\r\n     one that is loose and cloddy? Why?\r\n\r\n     3. Since the water which a plant uses comes through the roots, can\r\n     the morning dew afford any assistance?\r\n\r\n     4. Why are weeds objectionable in a growing crop?\r\n\r\n     5. Why does the farmer cultivate growing corn and cotton?\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV. HOW THE WATER RISES IN THE SOIL\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. USING LAMP-CHIMNEYS TO SHOW THE RISE OF WATER\r\nIN SOIL]\r\n\r\nWhen the hot, dry days of summer come, the soil depends upon the\r\nsubsoil, or undersoil, for the moisture that it must furnish its growing\r\nplants. The water was stored in the soil during the fall, winter, and\r\nspring months when there was plenty of rain. If you dig down into the\r\nsoil when everything is dry and hot, you will soon reach a cool, moist\r\nundersoil. The moisture increases as you dig deeper into the soil.\r\n\r\nNow the roots of plants go down into the soil for this moisture, because\r\nthey need the water to carry the plant food up into the stems and\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nYou can see how the water rises in the soil by performing a simple\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXPERIMENT=\r\n\r\n     Take a lamp-chimney and fill it with fine, dry dirt. The dirt from\r\n     a road or a field will do. Tie over the smaller end of the\r\n     lamp-chimney a piece of cloth or a pocket handkerchief, and place\r\n     this end in a shallow pan of water. If the soil in the lamp-chimney\r\n     is clay and well packed, the water will quickly rise to the top.\r\n\r\n     By filling three or four lamp-chimneys with as many different\r\n     soils, the pupil will see that the water rises more slowly in some\r\n     than in others.\r\n\r\n     Now take the water pan away, and the water in the lamp-chimneys\r\n     will gradually evaporate. Study for a few days the effect of\r\n     evaporation on the several soils.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V. DRAINING THE SOIL\r\n\r\nA wise man was once asked, \"What is the most valuable improvement ever\r\nmade in agriculture?\" He answered, \"Drainage.\" Often soils unfit for\r\ncrop-production because they contain too much water are by drainage\r\nrendered the most valuable of farming lands.\r\n\r\nDrainage benefits land in the following ways:\r\n\r\n1. It deepens the subsoil by removing unnecessary water from the spaces\r\nbetween the soil particles. This admits air. Then the oxygen which is in\r\nthe air, by aiding decay, prepares plant food for vegetation.\r\n\r\n2. It makes the surface soil, or topsoil, deeper. It stands to reason\r\nthat the deeper the soil the more plant food becomes available for plant\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n3. It improves the texture of the soil. Wet soil is sticky. Drainage\r\nmakes this sticky soil crumble and fall apart.\r\n\r\n4. It prevents washing.\r\n\r\n5. It increases the porosity of soils and permits roots to go deeper\r\ninto the soil for food and moisture.\r\n\r\n6. It increases the warmth of the soil.\r\n\r\n7. It permits earlier working in spring and after rains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. LAYING A TILE DRAIN]\r\n\r\n8. It favors the growth of germs which change the unavailable nitrogen\r\nof the soil into nitrates; that is, into the form of nitrogen most\r\nuseful to plants.\r\n\r\n9. It enables plants to resist drought better because the roots go into\r\nthe ground deeper early in the season.\r\n\r\nA soil that is hard and wet will not grow good crops. The\r\nnitrogen-gathering crops will store the greatest quantity of nitrogen in\r\nthe soil when the soil is open to the free circulation of the air.\r\nThese valuable crops cannot do this when the soil is wet and cold.\r\n\r\nSandy soils with sandy subsoils do not often need drainage; such soils\r\nare naturally drained. With clay soils it is different. It is very\r\nimportant to remove the stagnant water in them and to let the air in.\r\n\r\nWhen land has been properly drained the other steps in improvement are\r\neasily taken. After soil has been dried and mellowed by proper drainage,\r\nthen commercial fertilizers, barnyard manure, cowpeas, and clover can\r\nmost readily do their great work of improving the texture of the soil\r\nand of making it fitter for plant growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. A TILE IN POSITION]\r\n\r\n=Tile Drains.= Tile drains are the best and cheapest that can be used.\r\nIt would not be too strong to say that draining by tiles is the most\r\nperfect drainage. Thousands of practical tests in this country have\r\nproved the superiority of tile draining for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Good tile drains properly laid last for years and do not fill up.\r\n\r\n2. They furnish the cheapest possible means of removing too much water\r\nfrom the soil.\r\n\r\n3. They are out of reach of all cultivating tools.\r\n\r\n4. Surface water in filtering through the tiles leaves its nutritious\r\nelements for plant growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXPERIMENTS=\r\n\r\n     =To show the Effect of Drainage.= Take two tomato cans and fill\r\n     both with the same kind of soil. Punch several holes in the bottom\r\n     of one to drain the soil above and to admit air circulation. Leave\r\n     the other unpunctured. Plant seeds of any kind in both cans and\r\n     keep in a warm place. Add every third day equal quantities of\r\n     water. Let seeds grow in both cans and observe the difference in\r\n     growth for two or three weeks.\r\n\r\n     =To show the Effect of Air in Soils.= Take two tomato cans; fill\r\n     one with soil that is loose and warm, and the other with wet clay\r\n     or muck from a swampy field. Plant a few seeds of the same kind in\r\n     each and observe how much better the dry, warm, open soil is for\r\n     growing farm crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI. IMPROVING THE SOIL\r\n\r\nWe hear a great deal about the exhaustion or wearing out of the soil.\r\nMany uncomfortable people are always declaring that our lands will no\r\nlonger produce profitable crops, and hence that farming will no longer\r\npay.\r\n\r\nNow it is true, unfortunately, that much land has been robbed of its\r\nfertility, and, because this is true, we should be most deeply\r\ninterested in everything that leads to the improvement of our soils.\r\n\r\nWhen our country was first discovered and trees were growing everywhere,\r\nwe had virgin soils, or new soils that were rich and productive because\r\nthey were filled with vegetable matter and plant food. There are not\r\nmany virgin soils now because the trees have been cut from the best\r\nlands, and these lands have been farmed so carelessly that the vegetable\r\nmatter and available plant food have been largely used up. Now that\r\nfresh land is scarce it is very necessary to restore fertility to these\r\nexhausted lands. What are some of the ways in which this can be done?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. CLOVER IS A SOIL-IMPROVER]\r\n\r\nThere are several things to be done in trying to reclaim worn-out land.\r\nOne of the first of these is to till the land well. Many of you may have\r\nheard the story of the dying father who called his sons about him and\r\nwhispered feebly, \"There is great treasure hidden in the garden.\" The\r\nsons could hardly wait to bury their dead father before, thud, thud,\r\nthud, their picks were going in the garden. Day after day they dug; they\r\ndug deep; they dug wide. Not a foot of the crop-worn garden escaped the\r\nprobing of the pick as the sons feverishly searched for the expected\r\ntreasure. But no treasure was found. Their work seemed entirely useless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. INCREASING THE PRODUCTIVE POWER OF THE SOIL\r\nSecond crop of cowpeas on old, abandoned land]\r\n\r\n\"Let us not lose every whit of our labor; let us plant this pick-scarred\r\ngarden,\" said the eldest. So the garden was planted. In the fall the\r\nhitherto neglected garden yielded a harvest so bountiful, so unexpected,\r\nthat the meaning of their father's words dawned upon them. \"Truly,\" they\r\nsaid, \"a treasure was hidden there. Let us seek it in all our fields.\"\r\n\r\nThe story applies as well to-day as it did when it was first told.\r\nThorough culture of the soil, frequent and intelligent tillage--these\r\nare the foundations of soil-restoration.\r\n\r\nAlong with good tillage must go crop-rotation and good drainage. A\r\nsupply of organic matter will prevent heavy rains from washing the soil\r\nand carrying away plant food. Drainage will aid good tillage in allowing\r\nair to circulate between the soil particles and in arranging plant food\r\nso that plants can use it.\r\n\r\nBut we must add humus, or vegetable matter, to the soil. You remember\r\nthat the virgin soils contained a great deal of vegetable matter and\r\nplant food, but by the continuous growing of crops like wheat, corn, and\r\ncotton, and by constant shallow tillage, both humus and plant food have\r\nbeen used up. Consequently much of our cultivated soil to-day is hard\r\nand dead.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways of adding humus and plant food to this lifeless\r\nland: the first way is to apply barnyard manure (to adopt this method\r\nmeans that livestock raising must be a part of all farming); the second\r\nway is to adopt rotation of crops, and frequently to plow under crops\r\nlike clover and cowpeas; the third way is to apply commercial\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\nTo summarize: if we want to make our soil better year by year, we must\r\ncultivate well, drain well, and in the most economical way add humus and\r\nplant food.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXPERIMENT=\r\n\r\n     Select a small area of ground at your home and divide it into four\r\n     sections, as shown in the following sketch:\r\n\r\n     On Section _A_ apply barnyard manure; on Section _B_ apply\r\n     commercial fertilizers; on Section _C_ apply nothing, but till\r\n     well; on Section _D_ apply nothing, and till very poorly.\r\n\r\n     _A_, _B_, and _C_ should all be thoroughly plowed and harrowed.\r\n     Then add barnyard manure to _A_, commercial fertilizers to _B_, and\r\n     harrow _A_, _B_, and _C_ at least four times until the soil is\r\n     mellow and fine. _D_ will most likely be cloddy, like many fields\r\n     that we often see. Now plant on each plat some crop like cotton,\r\n     corn, or wheat. When the plats are ready to harvest, measure the\r\n     yield of each and determine whether the increased yield of the best\r\n     plats has paid for the outlay for tillage and manure. The pupil\r\n     will be much interested in the results obtained from the first\r\n     crop.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 13]\r\n\r\n     Now follow a system of crop-rotation on the plats. Clover can\r\n     follow corn or cotton or wheat; and cowpeas, wheat. Then determine\r\n     the yield of each plat for the second crop. By following these\r\n     plats for several years, and increasing the number, the pupils will\r\n     learn many things of greatest value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII. MANURING THE SOIL\r\n\r\nIn the early days of our history, when the soil was new and rich, we\r\nwere not compelled to use large amounts of manures and fertilizers. Yet\r\nour histories speak of an Indian named Squanto who came into one of the\r\nNew England colonies and showed the first settlers how, by putting a\r\nfish in each hill of corn, they could obtain larger yields.\r\n\r\nIf people in those days, with new and fertile soils, could use manures\r\nprofitably, how much more ought we to use them in our time, when soils\r\nhave lost their virgin fertility, and when the plant food in the soil\r\nhas been exhausted by years and years of cropping!\r\n\r\nTo sell year after year all the produce grown on land is a sure way to\r\nruin it. If, for example, the richest land is planted every year in\r\ncorn, and no stable or farmyard manure or other fertilizer returned to\r\nthe soil, the land so treated will of course soon become too poor to\r\ngrow any crop. If, on the other hand, clover or alfalfa or corn or\r\ncotton-seed meal is fed to stock, and the manure from the stock returned\r\nto the soil, the land will be kept rich. Hence those farmers who do not\r\nsell such raw products as cotton, corn, wheat, oats, and clover, but who\r\nmarket articles made from these raw products, find it easier to keep\r\ntheir land fertile. For illustration: if instead of selling hay, farmers\r\nfeed it to sheep and sell meat and wool; if instead of selling cotton\r\nseed, they feed its meal to cows, and sell milk and butter; if instead\r\nof selling stover, they feed it to beef cattle, they get a good price\r\nfor products and in addition have all the manure needed to keep their\r\nland productive and increase its value each year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:FIG. 14. RELATION OF HUMUS TO GROWTH OF CORN\r\n1, clay subsoil; 2, same, with fertilizer; 3, same, with humus]\r\n\r\nIf we wish to keep up the fertility of our lands we should not allow\r\nanything to be lost from our farms. All the manures, straw, roots,\r\nstubble, healthy vines--in fact everything decomposable--should be\r\nplowed under or used as a top-dressing. Especial care should be taken in\r\nstoring manure. It should be watchfully protected from sun and rain. If\r\na farmer has no shed under which to keep his manure, he should scatter\r\nit on his fields as fast as it is made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. THE COTTON PLANT WITH AND WITHOUT FOOD\r\nIn left top pot, no plant food; in left bottom pot, plant food scanty;\r\nin both right pots, all elements of plant food present]\r\n\r\nHe should understand also that liquid manure is of more value than\r\nsolid, because that important plant food, nitrogen, is found almost\r\nwholly in the liquid portion. Some of the phosphoric acid and\r\nconsiderable amounts of the potash are also found in the liquid manure.\r\nHence economy requires that none of this escape either by leakage or by\r\nfermentation. Sometimes one can detect the smell of ammonia in the\r\nstable. This ammonia is formed by the decomposition of the liquid\r\nmanure, and its loss should be checked by sprinkling some floats, acid\r\nphosphate, or muck over the stable floor.\r\n\r\nMany farmers find it desirable to buy fertilizers to use with the manure\r\nmade on the farm. In this case it is helpful to understand the\r\ncomposition, source, and availability of the various substances\r\ncomposing commercial fertilizers. The three most valuable things in\r\ncommercial fertilizers are nitrogen, potash, and phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen is obtained from (1) nitrate of soda mined in Chile, (2)\r\nammonium sulphate, a by-product of the gas works, (3) dried blood and\r\nother by-products of the slaughter-houses, and (4) cotton-seed meal.\r\nNitrate of soda is soluble in water and may therefore be washed away\r\nbefore being used by plants. For this reason it should be applied in\r\nsmall quantities and at intervals of a few weeks.\r\n\r\nPotash is obtained in Germany, where it is found in several forms. It is\r\nput on the market as muriate of potash, sulphate of potash, kainite,\r\nwhich contains salt as an impurity, and in other impure forms. Potash is\r\nfound also in _unleached_ wood ashes.\r\n\r\nPhosphoric acid is found in various rocks of Tennessee, Florida, and\r\nSouth Carolina, and also to a large extent in bones. The rocks or bones\r\nare usually treated with sulphuric acid. This treatment changes the\r\nphosphoric acid into a form ready for plant use.\r\n\r\nThese three kinds of plant food are ordinarily all that we need to\r\nsupply. In some cases, however, lime has to be added. Besides being a\r\nplant food itself, lime helps most soils by improving the structure of\r\nthe grains; by sweetening the soil, thereby aiding the little living\r\ngerms called _bacteria_; by hastening the decay of organic matter; and\r\nby setting free the potash that is locked up in the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL AND THE PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII. ROOTS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. ROOT-HAIRS ON A RADISH]\r\n\r\nYou have perhaps observed the regularity of arrangement in the twigs and\r\nbranches of trees. Now pull up the roots of a plant, as, for example,\r\nsheep sorrel, Jimson weed, or some other plant. Note the branching of\r\nthe roots. In these there is no such regularity as is seen in the twig.\r\nTrace the rootlets to their finest tips. How small, slender, and\r\ndelicate they are! Still we do not see the finest of them, for in taking\r\nthe plant from the ground we tore the most delicate away. In order to\r\nsee the real construction of a root we must grow one so that we may\r\nexamine it uninjured. To do this, sprout some oats in a germinator or in\r\nany box in which one glass side has been arranged and allow the oats to\r\ngrow till they are two or more inches high. Now examine the roots and\r\nyou will see very fine hairs, similar to those shown in the accompanying\r\nfigure, forming a fuzz over the surface of the roots near the tips. This\r\nfuzz is made of small hairs standing so close together that there are\r\noften as many as 38,200 on a single square inch. Fig. 17 shows how a\r\nroot looks when it has been cut crosswise into what is known as a cross\r\nsection. The figure is much increased in size. You can see how the\r\nroot-hairs extend from the root in every direction. Fig. 18 shows a\r\nsingle root-hair very greatly enlarged, with particles of sand sticking\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. A SLICE OF A ROOT\r\nHighly magnified]\r\n\r\nThese hairs are the feeding-organs of the roots, and they are formed\r\nonly near the tips of the finest roots. You see that the large, coarse\r\nroots that you are familiar with have nothing to do with _absorbing_\r\nplant food from the soil. They serve merely to _conduct_ the sap and\r\nnourishment from the root-hairs to the tree.\r\n\r\nWhen you apply manure or other fertilizer to a tree, remember that it is\r\nfar better to supply the fertilizer to the roots that are at some\r\ndistance from the trunk, for such roots are the real feeders. The plant\r\nfood in the manure soaks into the soil and immediately reaches the\r\nroot-hairs. You can understand this better by studying the distribution\r\nof the roots of an orchard tree, shown in Fig. 19. There you can see\r\nthat the fine tips are found at a long distance from the main trunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. A ROOT-HAIR WITH PARTICLES OF SOIL STICKING\r\nTO IT]\r\n\r\nYou can now readily see why it is that plants usually wilt when they are\r\ntransplanted. The fine, delicate root-hairs are then broken off, and the\r\nplant can but poorly keep up its food and water supply until new hairs\r\nhave been formed. While these are forming, water has been evaporating\r\nfrom the leaves, and consequently the plant does not get enough moisture\r\nand therefore droops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. DISTRIBUTION OF APPLE-TREE ROOTS]\r\n\r\nWould you not conclude that it is very poor farming to till deeply any\r\ncrop after the roots have extended between the rows far enough to be cut\r\nby the plow or cultivator? In cultivating between corn rows, for\r\nexample, if you find that you are disturbing fine roots, you may be sure\r\nthat you are breaking off millions of root-hairs from each plant and\r\nhence are doing harm rather than good. Fig. 20 shows how the roots from\r\none corn row intertangle with those of another. You see at a glance how\r\nmany of these roots would be destroyed by deep cultivation. Stirring\r\nthe upper inch of soil when the plants are well grown is sufficient\r\ntillage and does no injury to the roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. CORN ROOTS REACH FROM ROW TO ROW]\r\n\r\nA deep soil is much better than a shallow soil, as its depth makes it\r\njust so much easier for the roots to seek deep food. Fig. 21 illustrates\r\nwell how far down into the soil the alfalfa roots go.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21 ALFALFA ROOT]\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Dig up the roots of several cultivated plants and weeds and compare\r\n     them. Do you find some that are fine or fibrous? some fleshy like\r\n     the carrot? The dandelion is a good example of a tap-root.\r\n     Tap-roots are deep feeders. Examine very carefully the roots of a\r\n     medium-sized corn plant. Sift the dirt away gently so as to loosen\r\n     as few roots as possible. How do the roots compare in area with the\r\n     part above the ground? Try to trace a single root of the corn plant\r\n     from the stalk to its very tip. How long are the roots of mature\r\n     plants? Are they deep or shallow feeders? Germinate some oats or\r\n     beans in a glass-sided box, as suggested, and observe the\r\n     root-hairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IX. HOW THE PLANT FEEDS FROM THE SOIL\r\n\r\nPlants receive their nourishment from two sources--from the air and from\r\nthe soil. The soil food, or mineral food, dissolved in water, must reach\r\nthe plant through the root-hairs with which all plants are provided in\r\ngreat numbers. Each of these hairs may be compared to a finger reaching\r\namong the particles of earth for food and water. If we examine the\r\nroot-hairs ever so closely, we find no holes, or openings, in them. It\r\nis evident, then, that no solid particles can enter the root-hairs, but\r\nthat all food must pass into the root in solution.\r\n\r\nAn experiment just here will help us to understand how a root feeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. EXPERIMENT TO SHOW HOW ROOTS TAKE UP FOOD]\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXPERIMENT=\r\n\r\n     Secure a narrow glass tube like the one in Fig. 22. If you cannot\r\n     get a tube, a narrow, straight lamp-chimney will, with a little\r\n     care, do nearly as well. From a bladder made soft by soaking, cut a\r\n     piece large enough to cover the end of the tube or chimney and to\r\n     hang over a little all around. Make the piece of bladder secure to\r\n     the end of the tube by wrapping tightly with a waxed thread, as at\r\n     B. Partly fill the tube with molasses (or it may be easier in case\r\n     you use a narrow tube to fill it before attaching the bladder). Put\r\n     the tube into a jar or bottle of water so placed that the level of\r\n     the molasses inside and the water outside will be the same. Fasten\r\n     the tube in this position and observe it frequently for three or\r\n     four hours. At the end of the time you should find that the\r\n     molasses in the tube has risen above the level of the liquid\r\n     outside. It may even overflow at the top. If you use the\r\n     lamp-chimney the rise will not be so clearly seen, since a greater\r\n     volume is required to fill the space in the chimney. This increase\r\n     in the contents of the tube is due to the entrance of water from\r\n     the outside. The water has passed through the thin bladder, or\r\n     membrane, and has come to occupy space in the tube. There is also a\r\n     passage the other way, but the molasses can pass through the\r\n     bladder membrane so slowly that the passage is scarcely noticeable.\r\n     There are no holes, or openings, in the membrane, but still there\r\n     is a free passage of liquids in both directions, although the more\r\n     heavily laden solution must move more slowly.\r\n\r\nA root-hair acts in much the same way as the tube in our experiment,\r\nwith the exception that it is so made as to allow certain substances to\r\npass in only one direction, that is, toward the inside. The outside of\r\nthe root-hair is bathed in solutions rich in nourishment. The\r\nnourishment passes from the outside to the inside through the delicate\r\nmembrane of the root-hair. Thus does food enter the plant-root. From the\r\nroot-hairs, foods are carried to the inside of the root.\r\n\r\nFrom this you can see how important it is for a plant to have fine,\r\nloose soil for its root-hairs; also how necessary is the water in the\r\nsoil, since the food can be used only when it is dissolved in water.\r\n\r\nThis passage of liquids from one side of a membrane to another is called\r\n_osmosis_. It has many uses in the plant kingdom. We say a root takes\r\nnourishment by osmosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION X. ROOT-TUBERCLES\r\n\r\nTubercle is a big word, but you ought to know how to pronounce it and\r\nwhat is meant by root-tubercles. We are going to tell you what a\r\nroot-tubercle is and something about its importance to agriculture. When\r\nyou have learned this, we are sure you will want to examine some plants\r\nfor yourself in order that you may see just what tubercles look like on\r\na real root.\r\n\r\nRoot-tubercles do not form on all kinds of plants that farmers grow.\r\nThey are formed only on those kinds that botanists call _legumes_. The\r\nclovers, cowpeas, vetches, soy beans, and alfalfa are all legumes. The\r\ntubercles are little knotty, wart-like growths on the roots of the\r\nplants just named. These tubercles are caused by tiny forms of life\r\ncalled, as you perhaps already know, bacteria, or _germs_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. TUBERCLES ON CLOVER ROOTS\r\nThe specimen at the right was grown in soil inoculated with soil from an\r\nold clover field. The one at the left was grown in soil not inoculated]\r\n\r\nInstead of living in nests in trees like birds or in the ground like\r\nmoles and worms, these tiny germs, less than one twenty-five thousandth\r\nof an inch long, make their homes on the roots of legumes. Nestling\r\nsnugly together, they live, grow, and multiply in their sunless homes.\r\nThrough their activity the soil is enriched by the addition of much\r\nnitrogen from the air. They are the good fairies of the farmer, and no\r\nmagician's wand ever blessed a land so much as these invisible folk\r\nbless the land that they live in.\r\n\r\nJust as bees gather honey from the flowers and carry it to the hives,\r\nwhere they prepare it for their own future use and for the use of\r\nothers, so do these root-tubercles gather nitrogen from the air and fix\r\nit in their root homes, where it can be used by other crops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. SOY BEANS AND COWPEAS, TWO GREAT SOIL-IMPROVERS]\r\n\r\nIn the earlier pages of this book you were told something about the food\r\nof plants. One of the main elements of plant food, perhaps you remember,\r\nis nitrogen. Just as soon as the roots of the leguminous plants begin to\r\npush down into the soil, the bacteria, or germs that make the tubercles,\r\nbegin to build their homes on the roots, and in so doing they add\r\nnitrogen to the soil. You now see the importance of growing such crops\r\nas peas and clover on your land, for by their tubercles you can\r\nconstantly add plant food to the soil. Now this much-needed nitrogen is\r\nthe most costly part of the fertilizers that farmers buy every year. If\r\nevery farmer, then, would grow these tubercle-bearing crops, he would\r\nrapidly add to the richness of his land and at the same time escape the\r\nnecessity of buying so much expensive fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXPERIMENT=\r\n\r\n     Take a spade or shovel and dig carefully around the roots of a\r\n     cowpea and a clover plant; loosen the earth thoroughly and then\r\n     pull the plants up, being careful not to break off any of the\r\n     roots. Now wash the roots, and after they become dry count the\r\n     nodules, or tubercles, on them. Observe the difference in size. How\r\n     are they arranged? Do all leguminous plants have equal numbers of\r\n     nodules? How do these nodules help the farmer?\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XI. THE ROTATION OF CROPS\r\n\r\nDoubtless you know what is meant by rotation, for your teacher has\r\nexplained to you already how the earth rotates, or turns, on its axis\r\nand revolves around the sun. When we speak of crop-rotation we mean not\r\nonly that the same crop should not be planted on the same land for two\r\nsuccessive years but that crops should follow one another in a regular\r\norder.\r\n\r\nMany farmers do not follow a system of farming that involves a change of\r\ncrops. In some parts of the country the same fields are planted to corn\r\nor wheat or cotton year after year. This is not a good practice and\r\nsooner or later will wear out the soil completely, because the\r\nsoil-elements that furnish the food of that constant crop are soon\r\nexhausted and good crop-production is no longer possible.\r\n\r\nWhy is crop-rotation so necessary? There are different kinds of plant\r\nfood in the soil. If any one of these is used up, the soil of course\r\nloses its power to feed plants properly. Now each crop uses more of some\r\nof the different kinds of foods than others do, just as you like some\r\nkinds of food better than others. But the crop cannot, as you can, learn\r\nto use the kinds of food it does not like; it must use the kind that\r\nnature fitted it to use. Not only do different crops feed upon different\r\nsoil foods, but they use different quantities of these foods.\r\n\r\nNow if a farmer plant the same crop in the same field each year, that\r\ncrop soon uses up all of the available plant food that it likes. Hence\r\nthe soil can no longer properly nourish the crop that has been year by\r\nyear robbing it. If that crop is to be successfully grown again on the\r\nland, the exhausted element must be restored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. GRASS FOLLOWING CORN]\r\n\r\nThis can be done in two ways: first, by finding out what element has\r\nhere been exhausted, and then restoring this element by means either of\r\ncommercial fertilizers or manure; second, by planting on the land crops\r\nthat feed on different food and that will allow or assist kind Mother\r\nNature \"to repair her waste places.\" An illustration may help you to\r\nremember this fact. Nitrogen is, as already explained, one of the\r\ncommonest plant foods. It may almost be called plant bread. The wheat\r\ncrop uses up a good deal of nitrogen. Suppose a field were planted in\r\nwheat year after year. Most of the available nitrogen would be taken out\r\nof the soil after a while, and a new wheat crop, if planted on the\r\nfield, would not get enough of its proper food to yield a paying\r\nharvest. This same land, however, that could not grow wheat could\r\nproduce other crops that do not require so much nitrogen. For example,\r\nit could grow cowpeas. Cowpeas, aided by their root-tubercles, are able\r\nto gather from the air a great part of the nitrogen needed for their\r\ngrowth. Thus a good crop of peas can be obtained even if there is little\r\navailable nitrogen in the soil. On the other hand wheat and corn and\r\ncotton cannot use the free nitrogen of the air, and they suffer if there\r\nis an insufficient quantity present in the soil; hence the necessity of\r\ngrowing legumes to supply what is lacking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. COWPEAS AND CORN--AUGUST]\r\n\r\nLet us now see how easily plant food may be saved by the rotation of\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nIf you sow wheat in the autumn it is ready to be harvested in time for\r\nplanting cowpeas. Plow or disk the wheat stubble, and sow the same field\r\nto cowpeas. If the wheat crop has exhausted the greater part of the\r\nnitrogen of the soil, it makes no difference to the cowpea; for the\r\ncowpea will get its nitrogen from the air and not only provide for its\r\nown growth but will leave quantities of nitrogen in the queer nodules of\r\nits roots for the crops coming after it in the rotation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. COWPEAS AND CORN--OCTOBER]\r\n\r\nIf corn be planted, there should be a rotation in just the same way. The\r\ncorn plant, a summer grower, of course uses a certain portion of the\r\nplant food stored in the soil. In order that the crop following the corn\r\nmay feed on what the corn did not use, this crop should be one that\r\nrequires a somewhat different food. Moreover, it should be one that fits\r\nin well with corn so as to make a winter crop. We find just such a\r\nplant in clover or wheat. Like the cowpea, all the varieties of clover\r\nhave on their roots tubercles that add the important element, nitrogen,\r\nto the soil.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts is it not clear that if you wish to improve your land\r\nquickly and keep it always fruitful you must practice crop-rotation?\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ILLUSTRATION OF CROP-ROTATION\r\n\r\nHere are two systems of crop-rotation as practiced at one or more\r\nagricultural experiment stations. Each furnishes an ideal plan for\r\nkeeping up land.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------++----------------------++----------------------\r\n  ---------------------++----------------------++----------------------\r\n   FIRST YEAR || SECOND YEAR || THIRD YEAR\r\n  ----------+----------++-----------+----------++-----------+----------\r\n  Summer    | Winter   || Summer    | Winter   || Summer    | Winter\r\n  ----------+----------++-----------+----------++-----------+----------\r\n  Corn      | Crimson  || Cotton    | Wheat    || Cowpeas   | Rye for\r\n            | clover   ||           |          ||           | pasture\r\n  ----------+----------++-----------+----------++-----------+----------\r\n\r\n                                    or\r\n\r\n  ----------+----------++-----------+----------++-----------+----------\r\n  Summer    | Winter   || Summer    | Winter   || Summer    | Winter\r\n  ----------+----------++-----------+----------++-----------+----------\r\n  Corn      | Wheat    ||  Clover   |  Clover  || Grass     | Grass for\r\n            |          || and grass | and grass||           |pasture or\r\n            |          ||           |          ||           | meadow\r\n  ----------+----------++-----------+----------++-----------+----------\r\n  ----------+----------++-----------+----------++-----------+----------\r\n\r\nIn these rotations the cowpeas and clovers are nitrogen-gathering crops.\r\nThey not only furnish hay but they enrich the soil. The wheat, corn, and\r\ncotton are money crops, but in addition they are cultivated crops; hence\r\nthey improve the physical condition of the soil and give opportunity to\r\nkill weeds. The grasses and clovers are of course used for pasturage and\r\nhay. This is only a suggested rotation. Work out one that will meet your\r\nhome need.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Let the pupils each present a system of rotation that includes the\r\n     crops raised at home. The system presented should as nearly as\r\n     possible meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\n     1. Legumes for gathering nitrogen.\r\n     2. Money crops for cash income.\r\n     3. Cultivated crops for tillage and weed-destruction.\r\n     4. Food crops for feeding live stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XII. HOW A PLANT FEEDS FROM THE AIR\r\n\r\nIf you partly burn a match you will see that it becomes black. This\r\nblack substance into which the match changes is called _carbon_. Examine\r\na fresh stick of charcoal, which is, as you no doubt know, burnt wood.\r\nYou see in the charcoal every fiber that you saw in the wood itself.\r\nThis means that every part of the plant contains carbon. How important,\r\nthen, is this substance to the plant!\r\n\r\nYou will be surprised to know that the total amount of carbon in plants\r\ncomes from the air. All the carbon that a plant gets is taken in by the\r\nleaves of the plant; not a particle is gathered by the roots. A large\r\ntree, weighing perhaps 11,000 pounds, requires in its growth carbon from\r\n16,000,000 cubic yards of air.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, after these statements, you may think there is danger that the\r\ncarbon of the air may sometime become exhausted. The air of the whole\r\nworld contains about 1,760,000,000,000 pounds of carbon. Moreover, this\r\nis continually being added to by our fires and by the breath of animals.\r\nWhen wood or coal is used for fuel the carbon of the burning substance\r\nis returned to the air in the form of gas. Some large factories burn\r\ngreat quantities of coal and thus turn much carbon back to the air. A\r\nsingle factory in Germany is estimated to give back to the air daily\r\nabout 5,280,000 pounds of carbon. You see, then, that carbon is\r\nconstantly being put back into the air to replace that which is used by\r\ngrowing plants.\r\n\r\nThe carbon of the air can be used by none but green plants, and by them\r\nonly in the sunlight. We may compare the green coloring matter of the\r\nleaf to a machine, and the sunlight to the power, or energy, which keeps\r\nthe machine in motion. By means, then, of sunlight and the green\r\ncoloring matter of the leaves, the plant secures carbon. The carbon\r\npasses into the plant and is there made into two foods very necessary to\r\nthe plant; namely, starch and sugar.\r\n\r\nSometimes the plant uses the starch and sugar immediately. At other\r\ntimes it stores both away, as it does in the Irish and the sweet potato\r\nand in beets, cabbage, peas, and beans. These plants are used as food by\r\nman because they contain so much nourishment; that is, starch and sugar\r\nwhich were stored away by the plant for its own future use.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Examine some charcoal. Can you see the rings of growth? Slightly\r\n     char paper, cloth, meat, sugar, starch, etc. What does the turning\r\n     black prove? What per cent of these substances do you think is pure\r\n     carbon?\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIII. THE SAP CURRENT\r\n\r\nThe root-hairs take nourishment from the soil. The leaves manufacture\r\nstarch and sugar. These manufactured foods must be carried to all parts\r\nof the plant. There are two currents to carry them. One passes from the\r\nroots through the young wood to the leaves, and one, a downward current,\r\npasses through the bark, carrying needed food to the roots (see Fig.\r\n28).\r\n\r\nIf you should injure the roots, the water supply to the leaves would be\r\ncut off and the leaves would immediately wither. On the other hand, if\r\nyou remove the bark, that is, girdle the tree, you in no way interfere\r\nwith the water supply and the leaves do not wither. Girdling does,\r\nhowever, interfere with the downward food current through the bark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28 MOVEMENT OF THE SAP CURRENT]\r\n\r\nIf the tree be girdled the roots sooner or later suffer from lack of\r\nfood supply from the leaves. Owing to this food stoppage the roots will\r\ncease to grow and will soon be unable to take in sufficient water, and\r\nthen the leaves will begin to droop. This, however, may not happen until\r\nseveral months after the girdling. Sometimes a partly girdled branch\r\ngrows much in thickness just above the girdle, as is shown in Fig. 29.\r\nThis extra growth seems to be due to a stoppage of the rich supply of\r\nfood which was on its way to the roots through the bark. It could go no\r\nfarther and was therefore used by the tree to make an unnatural growth\r\nat this point. You will now understand how and why trees die when they\r\nare girdled to clear new ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. A THICKENING ABOVE THE WIRE THAT CAUSED THE\r\nGIRDLING]\r\n\r\nIt is, then, the general law of sap-movement that the upward current\r\nfrom the roots passes through the woody portion of the trunk, and that\r\nthe current bearing the food made by the leaves passes downward through\r\nthe bark.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Let the teacher see that these and all other experiments are\r\n     performed by the pupils. Do not allow them to guess, but make them\r\n     see.\r\n\r\n     Girdle valueless trees or saplings of several kinds, cutting the\r\n     bark away in a complete circle around the tree. Do not cut into the\r\n     wood. How long before the tree shows signs of injury? Girdle a\r\n     single small limb on a tree. What happens? Explain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIV. THE FLOWER AND THE SEED\r\n\r\nSome people think that the flowers by the wayside are for the purpose of\r\nbeautifying the world and increasing man's enjoyment. Do you think this\r\nis true? Undoubtedly a flower is beautiful, and to be beautiful is one\r\nof the uses of many flowers; but it is not the chief use of a flower.\r\n\r\nYou know that when peach or apple blossoms are nipped by the spring\r\nfrost the fruit crop is in danger. The fruit of the plant bears the\r\nseed, and the flower produces the fruit. That is its chief duty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. PARTS OF THE PISTIL]\r\n\r\nDo you know any plant that produces seed without flowers? Some one\r\nanswers, \"The corn, the elm, and the maple all produce seed, but have no\r\nflower.\" No, that is not correct. If you look closely you will find in\r\nthe spring very small flowers on the elm and on the maple, while the ear\r\nand the tassel are really the blossoms of the corn plant. Every plant\r\nthat produces seed has flowers, although they may sometimes seem very\r\ncurious flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. A BUTTERCUP]\r\n\r\nLet us see what a flower really is. Take, for example, a buttercup,\r\ncotton, tobacco, or plum blossom (see Figs. 31 and 32). You will find on\r\nthe outside a row of green leaves inclosing the flower when it is still\r\na bud. These leaves are the _sepals_. Next on the inside is a row of\r\ncolored leaves, or _petals_. Arranged inside of the petals are some\r\nthreadlike parts, each with a knob on the end. These are the _stamens_.\r\nExamine one stamen closely (Fig. 33). On the knob at its tip you should\r\nfind, if the flower is fully open, some fine grains, or powder. In the\r\nlily this powder is so abundant that in smelling the flower you often\r\nbrush a quantity of it off on your nose. This substance is called\r\n_pollen_, and the knob on the end of the stamen, on which the pollen is\r\nborne, is the _anther_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. A PLUM BLOSSOM]\r\n\r\nThe pollen is of very great importance to the flower. Without it there\r\ncould be no seeds. The stamens as pollen-bearers, then, are very\r\nimportant. But there is another part to each flower that is of equal\r\nvalue. This part you will find in the center of the flower, inside the\r\ncircle of stamens. It is called the _pistil_ (Fig. 32). The swollen tip\r\nof the pistil is the _stigma_. The swollen base of the pistil forms the\r\n_ovary_. If you carefully cut open this ovary you will find in it\r\nvery small immature seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. STAMENS\r\n_a_, anther; _f_, filament]\r\n\r\nSome plants bear all these parts in the same flower; that is, each\r\nblossom has stamens, pistil, petals, and sepals. The pear blossom and\r\nthe tomato blossom represent such flowers. Other plants bear their\r\nstamens and pistils in separate blossoms. Stamens and pistils may even\r\noccur in separate plants, and some blossoms have no sepals or petals at\r\nall. Look at the corn plant. Here the tassel is a cluster of many\r\nflowers, each of which bears only stamens. The ear is likewise a cluster\r\nof many flowers, each of which bears only a pistil. The dust that you\r\nsee falling from the tassel is the pollen, and the long silky threads of\r\nthe ear are the stigmas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. A TOMATO BLOSSOM]\r\n\r\nNow no plant can bear seeds unless the pollen of the stamen falls on the\r\nstigma. Corn cannot therefore form seed unless the dust of the tassel\r\nfalls upon the silk. Did you ever notice how poorly the cob is filled on\r\na single cornstalk standing alone in a field? Do you see why? It is\r\nbecause when a plant stands alone the wind blows the pollen away from\r\nthe tassel, and little or none is received on the stigmas below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. CUCUMBER BLOSSOMS]\r\n\r\nIn the corn plant the stamens and pistils are separate; that is, they do\r\nnot occur on the same flower, although they are on the same plant. This\r\nis also true of the cucumber (see Fig. 35). In many plants, however,\r\nsuch as the hemp, hop, sassafras, willow, and others, the staminate\r\nparts are on one plant and the pistillate parts are on another. This is\r\nalso true in several other cultivated plants. For example, in some\r\nstrawberries the stamens are absent or useless; that is, they bear no\r\ngood pollen. In such cases the grower must see to it that near by are\r\nstrawberry plants that bear stamens, in order that those plants which do\r\nnot bear pollen may become _pollinated_; that is, may have pollen\r\ncarried to them. After the stigma has been supplied with pollen, a\r\nsingle pollen grain sends a threadlike sprout down through the stigma\r\ninto the ovary. This process, if successfully completed, is called\r\n_fertilization_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Examine several flowers and identify the parts named in the last\r\n     section. Try in the proper season to find the pollen on the maple,\r\n     willow, alder, and pine, and on wheat, cotton, and the\r\n     morning-glory.\r\n\r\n     How fast does the ovary of the apple blossom enlarge? Measure one\r\n     and watch it closely from day to day. Can you find any plants that\r\n     have their stamens and ovaries on separate individuals?\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XV. POLLINATION\r\n\r\nNature has several interesting ways of bringing about pollination. In\r\nthe corn, willow, and pine the pollen is picked up by the wind and\r\ncarried away. Much of it is lost, but some reaches the stigmas, or\r\nreceptive parts, of other corn, willow, or pine flowers. This is a very\r\nwasteful method, and all plants using it must provide much pollen.\r\n\r\nMany plants employ a much better method. They have learned how to make\r\ninsects bear their pollen. In plants of this type the parts of the\r\nblossom are so shaped and so placed as to deposit pollen from the stamen\r\non the insect and to receive pollen from the insect on the stigmas.\r\n\r\nWhen you see the clumsy bumblebee clambering over and pushing his way\r\ninto a clover blossom, you may be sure that he is getting well dusted\r\nwith pollen and that the next blossom which he visits will secure a full\r\nshare on its stigmas.\r\n\r\nWhen flowers fit themselves to be pollinated by insects they can no\r\nlonger use the wind and are helpless if insects do not visit them. They\r\ntherefore cunningly plan two ways to invite the visits of insects.\r\nFirst, they provide a sweet nectar as a repast for the insect visitor.\r\nThe nectar is a sugary solution found in the bottom of the flower and is\r\nused by the visitor as food or to make honey. Second, flowers advertise\r\nto let each insect know that they have something for it. The advertising\r\nis done either by showy colors or by perfume. Insects have wonderful\r\npowers of smell. When you see showy flowers or smell fragrant ones, you\r\nwill know that such flowers are advertising the presence either of\r\nnectar or of pollen (to make beebread) and that such flowers depend on\r\ninsects for pollination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36. BEES CARRYING POLLEN]\r\n\r\nA season of heavy, cold rains during blossoming-time may often injure\r\nthe fruit crop by preventing insects from carrying pollen from flower to\r\nflower. You now also understand why plants often fail to produce seeds\r\nindoors. Since they are shut in, they cannot receive proper insect\r\nvisits. Plants such as tomatoes or other garden fruits dependent upon\r\ninsect pollination must, if raised in the greenhouse where insects\r\ncannot visit them, be pollinated by hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Exclude insect visitors from some flower or flower cluster, for\r\n     example, clover, by covering with a paper bag, and see whether the\r\n     flower can produce seeds that are capable of growing. Compare as to\r\n     number and vitality the seeds of such a flower with those of an\r\n     uncovered flower. Observe insects closely. Do you ever find pollen\r\n     on them? What kinds of insects visit the clover? the cowpea? the\r\n     sourwood? the flax? Is wheat pollinated by insects or by the wind\r\n     or by some other means? Do bees fly in rainy weather? How will a\r\n     long rainy season at blossoming-time affect the apple crop? Why?\r\n     Should bees be kept in an orchard? Why?\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVI. CROSSES, HYBRIDS, AND CROSS-POLLINATION\r\n\r\nIn our study of flowers and their pollination we have seen that the seed\r\nis usually the descendant of two parents, or at least of two organs--one\r\nthe ovary, producing the seed; the other the pollen, which is necessary\r\nto fertilize the ovary.\r\n\r\nIt happens that sometimes the pollen of one blossom fertilizes the ovary\r\nof its own flower, but more often the pollen from one plant fertilizes\r\nthe ovary of another plant. This latter method is called\r\n_cross-pollination_. As a rule cross-pollination makes seed that will\r\nproduce a better plant than simple pollination would. Cross-pollination\r\nby hand is often used by plant-breeders when, for purposes of\r\nseed-selection, a specially strong plant is desired. The steps in hand\r\npollination are as follows: (1) remove the anthers before they open, to\r\nprevent them from pollinating the stigma (the steps in this process are\r\nillustrated in Figs. 37, 38-39); (2) cover the flower thus treated with\r\na paper bag to prevent stray pollen from getting on it (see Fig. 40);\r\n(3) when the ovary is sufficiently developed, carry pollen to the stigma\r\nby hand from the anthers of another plant which you have selected to\r\nfurnish it, and rebag to keep out any stray pollen which might\r\naccidentally get in; (4) collect the seeds when they are mature and\r\nlabel them properly.\r\n\r\nHand pollination has this advantage--you know both parents of your seed.\r\nIf pollination occur naturally you know the maternal but have no means\r\nof judging the paternal parent. You can readily see, therefore, how hand\r\npollination enables you to secure seed derived from two well-behaved\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nSometimes we can breed one kind of plant on another. The result of such\r\ncross-breeding is known as a _hybrid_. In the animal kingdom the mule is\r\na common example of this cross-breeding. Plant hybrids were formerly\r\ncalled mules also, but this suggestive term is almost out of use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37\r\nThe bud on right at top is in proper condition for removal of anthers;\r\nthe anthers have been removed from the buds below]\r\n\r\nIt is only when plants of two distinct kinds are crossed that the result\r\nis called a hybrid; for example, a blackjack oak on a white oak, an\r\napple on a pear. If the parent plants are closely related, for example,\r\ntwo kinds of apples, the resulting plant is known simply as a _cross_.\r\n\r\nHybrids and crosses are valuable in that they usually differ from both\r\nparents and yet combine some qualities of each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38. ORANGE BLOSSOM PREPARED FOR CROSSING\r\nFirst, bud; second, anthers unremoved; third, anthers removed]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39. TOMATO BLOSSOM READY TO CROSS\r\nFirst, bud; second, anthers unremoved; third, anthers removed]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.\r\nFirst, blossom bagged to keep out stray pollen; second, fruit bagged for\r\nprotection]\r\n\r\nThey often leave off some of the qualities of the parent\r\nplants and at other times have such qualities more markedly than did\r\ntheir parents. Thus they often produce an interesting new kind of plant.\r\nSometimes we are able by hybridization to combine in one plant the good\r\nqualities of two other plants and thus make a great advance in\r\nagriculture. The new forms brought about by hybridization may be fixed,\r\nor made permanent, by such selection as is mentioned in Section XVIII.\r\nHybridization is of great aid in originating new plants.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that a plant will be more fruitful when pollinated by\r\none variety than by some other variety. This is well illustrated in Fig.\r\n41. A fruit-grower or farmer should know much about these subjects\r\nbefore selecting varieties for his orchard, vineyard, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     With the help of your teacher try to cross some plants. Such an\r\n     experiment will take time, but will be most interesting. You must\r\n     remember that many crosses must be attempted in order to gain\r\n     success with even a few.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVII. PROPAGATION BY BUDS\r\n\r\nIt is the business of the farmer to make plants grow, or, as it is\r\ngenerally called, to propagate plants. This he does in one of two ways:\r\nby buds (that is, by small pieces cut from parent plants), or by seeds.\r\nThe chief aim in both methods should be to secure in the most convenient\r\nmanner the best-paying plants.\r\n\r\nMany plants are most easily and quickly propagated by buds; for example,\r\nthe grape, red raspberry, fig, and many others that we cultivate for the\r\nflower only, such as the carnation, geranium, rose, and begonia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.\r\nBrighton pollinated by 1, Salem; 2, Creveling; 3, Lindley; 4, Brighton;\r\n5, Self-pollinated; 6, Nectar; 7, Jefferson; 8, Niagara]\r\n\r\nIn growing plants from cuttings, a piece is taken from the kind of plant\r\nthat one wishes to grow. The greatest care must be exercised in order to\r\nget a healthy cutting. If we take a cutting from a poor plant, what can\r\nwe expect but to grow a poor plant like the one from which our cutting\r\nwas taken? On the other hand, if a fine, strong, vigorous, fruitful\r\nplant be selected, we shall expect to grow just such a fine, healthy,\r\nfruitful plant.\r\n\r\nWe expect the cutting to make exactly the same variety of plant as the\r\nparent stock. We must therefore decide on the variety of berry, grape,\r\nfig, carnation, or rose that we wish to propagate, and then look for the\r\nstrongest and most promising plants of this variety within our reach.\r\nThe utmost care will not produce a fine plant if we start from poor\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42. GERANIUM CUTTING\r\nDotted line shows depth to which cutting should be planted]\r\n\r\nWhat qualities are most desirable in a plant from which cuttings are to\r\nbe taken? First, it should be productive, hardy, and suited to your\r\nclimate and your needs; second, it should be healthy. Do not take\r\ncuttings from a diseased plant, since the cutting may carry the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nCuttings may be taken from various parts of the plant, sometimes even\r\nfrom parts of the leaf, as in the begonia (Fig. 46). More often,\r\nhowever, they are drawn from parts of the stem (Figs. 43-45). As to the\r\nage of the twig from which the cutting is to be taken, Professor Bailey\r\nsays: \"For most plants the proper age or maturity of wood for the making\r\nof cuttings may be determined by giving the twig a quick bend; if it\r\nsnaps and hangs by the bark, it is in proper condition. If it bends\r\nwithout breaking, it is too young and soft or too old. If it splinters,\r\nit is too old and woody.\" Some plants, as the geranium (Fig. 42),\r\nsucceed best if the cuttings from which they are grown are taken from\r\nsoft, young parts of the plant; others, for example, the grape or rose,\r\ndo better when the cutting is made from more mature wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43 GRAPE CUTTING\r\nShowing depth to which cutting should be planted]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44. CARNATION CUTTING]\r\n\r\nCuttings may vary in size and may include one or more buds. After a\r\nhardy, vigorous cutting is made, insert it about one half or one third\r\nof its length in soil. A soil free from organic matter is much the best,\r\nsince in such soil the cuttings are much less liable to disease. A fine,\r\nclean sand is commonly used by professional gardeners. When cuttings\r\nhave rooted well--this may require a month or more--they may be\r\ntransplanted to larger pots.\r\n\r\nSometimes, instead of cutting off a piece and rooting it, portions of\r\nbranches are made to root before they are separated from the parent\r\nplant. This method is often followed, and is known as _layering_. It is\r\na simple process. Just bend the tip of a bough down and bury it in the\r\nearth (see Fig. 47). The black raspberry forms layers naturally, but\r\ngardeners often aid it by burying the over-hanging tips in the earth, so\r\nthat more tips may easily take root. Strawberries develop runners that\r\nroot themselves in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\nGrafts and buds are really cuttings which, instead of being buried in\r\nsand to produce roots of their own, are set on the roots of other\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45. ROSE CUTTING]\r\n\r\nGrafting and budding are practiced when these methods are more\r\nconvenient than cuttings or when the gardener thinks there is danger of\r\nfailure to get plants to take root as cuttings. Neither grafting nor\r\nbudding is, however, necessary for the raspberry or the grape, for these\r\npropagate most readily from cuttings.\r\n\r\nIt is often the case that a budded or grafted plant is more fruitful\r\nthan a plant on its own roots. In cases of this kind, of course, grafts\r\nor buds are used.\r\n\r\nThe white, or Irish, potato is usually propagated from pieces of the\r\npotato itself. Each piece used for planting bears one eye or more. The\r\npotato itself is really an underground stem and the eyes are buds. This\r\nmethod of propagation is therefore really a peculiar kind of cutting.\r\n\r\nSince the eye is a bud and our potato plant for next year is to develop\r\nfrom this bud, it is of much importance, as we have seen, to know\r\nexactly what _kind_ of plant our potato comes from. If the potato is\r\ntaken from a small plant that had but a few poor potatoes in the hill,\r\nwe may expect the bud to produce a similar plant and a correspondingly\r\npoor crop. We must see to it, then, that our seed potatoes are drawn\r\nfrom vines that were good producers, because new potato plants are like\r\nthe plants from which they were grown. Of course when our potatoes are\r\nin the bin we cannot tell from what kind of plants they came. We must\r\ntherefore _select our seed potatoes in the field_. Seed potatoes should\r\nalways be selected from those hills that produce most bountifully. Be\r\nassured that the increased yield will richly repay this care in\r\nselecting. It matters not so much whether the seed potato be large or\r\nsmall; it must, however, come from a hill bearing a large yield of fine\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46. BEGONIA-LEAF CUTTING]\r\n\r\nSweet-potato plants are produced from shoots, or growing buds, taken\r\nfrom the potato itself, so that in their case too the piece that we use\r\nin propagating is a part of the original plant, and will therefore be\r\nlike it under similar conditions. Just as with the Irish potato, it is\r\nimportant to know how good a yielder you are planting. You should watch\r\nduring harvest and select for propagation for the next year only such\r\nplants as yield best.\r\n\r\nWe should exercise fully as much care in selecting proper individuals\r\nfrom which to make a cutting or a layer as we do in selecting a proper\r\nanimal to breed from. Just as we select the finest Jersey in the herd\r\nfor breeding purposes, so we should choose first the variety of plant we\r\ndesire and then the finest individual plant of that variety.\r\n\r\nIf the variety of the potato that we desire to raise be Early Rose, it\r\nis not enough to select _any_ Early Rose plants, but the very best Early\r\nRose plants, to furnish our seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47. LAYERING]\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to select large, fine potatoes for cuttings. A large\r\npotato may not produce a bountifully yielding plant. _It will produce a\r\nplant like the one that produced it._ It may be that this one large\r\npotato was the only one produced by the original plant. If so, the plant\r\nthat grows from it will tend to be similarly unproductive. Thus you see\r\nthe importance of _selecting in the field a plant that has exactly the\r\nqualities desired in the new plant_.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons why gardeners raise plants from buds instead of\r\nfrom seeds is that the seed of many plants will not produce plants like\r\nthe parent. This failure to \"come true,\" as it is called, is sometimes\r\nof value, for it occasionally leads to improvement. For example, suppose\r\nthat a thousand apple or other fruit or flower seeds from plants usually\r\npropagated by cuttings be planted; it may be that one out of a thousand\r\nor a million will be a very valuable plant. If a valuable plant be so\r\nproduced, it should be most carefully guarded, multiplied by cuttings or\r\ngrafts, and introduced far and wide. It is in this way that new\r\nvarieties of fruits and flowers are produced from time to time.\r\n\r\nSometimes, too, a single bud on a tree will differ from the other buds\r\nand will produce a branch different from the other branches. This is\r\nknown as _bud variation_. When there is thus developed a branch which\r\nhappens to be of a superior kind, it should be propagated by cuttings\r\njust as you would propagate it if it had originated from a seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48. CURRANT CUTTING]\r\n\r\nMr. Gideon of Minnesota planted many apple seeds, and from them all\r\nraised one tree that was very fruitful, finely flavored, and able to\r\nwithstand the cold Minnesota winter. This tree he multiplied by grafts\r\nand named the Wealthy apple. It is said that in giving this one apple to\r\nthe world he benefited mankind to the value of more than one million\r\ndollars. It will be well to watch for any valuable bud or seed variant\r\nand never let a promising one be lost. Plants grown in this way from\r\nseeds are usually spoken of as seedlings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LUSCIOUS AND EASILY GROWN BERRY]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTS TO BE PROPAGATED FROM BUDS\r\n\r\nThe following list gives the names and methods by which our common\r\ngarden fruits and flowers are propagated:\r\n\r\n  _Figs_: use cuttings 8 to 10 inches long or layer.\r\n  _Grapes_: use long cuttings, layer, or graft upon old vines.\r\n\r\n  _Apples_: graft upon seedlings, usually crab seedlings one\r\n  year old.\r\n\r\n  _Pears_: bud upon pear seedlings.\r\n\r\n  _Cherries_: bud upon cherry stock.\r\n\r\n  _Plums_: bud upon peach stock.\r\n\r\n  _Peaches_: bud upon peach or plum seedlings.\r\n\r\n  _Quinces_: use cuttings or layer.\r\n\r\n  _Blackberries_: propagate by suckers; cut from parent stem.\r\n\r\n  _Black raspberries_: layer; remove old stem.\r\n\r\n  _Red raspberries_: propagate by root-cuttings or suckers.\r\n\r\n  _Strawberries_: propagate by runners.\r\n\r\n  _Currants_ and _gooseberries_: use long cuttings (these plants\r\n  grow well only in cool climates; if attempted in warm\r\n  climates, set in cold exposure).\r\n\r\n  _Carnations_, _geraniums_, _roses_, _begonias_, etc.: propagate by\r\n  cuttings rooted in sand and then transplanted to small pots.\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Propagate fruits (grape, fig, strawberry) of various kinds; also\r\n     ornamental plants. How long does it take them to root? Geraniums\r\n     rooted in the spring will bloom in the fall. Do you know any one\r\n     who selects seed potatoes properly? Make a careful selection of\r\n     seed at the next harvest-time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVIII. PLANT SEEDING\r\n\r\nIn propagating by seed, as in reproducing by buds, we select a portion\r\nof the parent plant--for a seed is surely a part of the parent\r\nplant--and place it in the ground. There is, however, one great\r\ndifference between a seed and a bud. The bud is really a piece of the\r\nparent plant, but a piece of _one_ plant only, while a seed comes from\r\nthe parts of two plants.\r\n\r\nYou will understand this fully if you read carefully Sections XIV-XVI.\r\nSince the seed is made of two plants, the plant that springs from a seed\r\nis much more likely to differ from its mother plant, that is, from the\r\nplant that produces the seed, than is a plant produced merely by buds.\r\nIn some cases plants \"come true to seed\" very accurately. In others they\r\nvary greatly. For example, when we plant the seed of wheat, turnips,\r\nrye, onions, tomatoes, tobacco, or cotton, we get plants that are in\r\nmost respects like the parent plant. On the other hand the seed of a\r\nCrawford peach or a Baldwin apple or a Bartlett pear will not produce\r\nplants like its parent, but will rather resemble its wild forefathers.\r\nThese seedlings, thus taking after their ancestors, are always far\r\ninferior to our present cultivated forms. In such cases seeding is not\r\npracticable, and we must resort to bud propagation of one sort or\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWhile in a few plants like those just mentioned the seed does not \"come\r\ntrue,\" most plants, for example, cotton, tobacco, and others, do \"come\r\ntrue.\" When we plant King cotton we may expect to raise King cotton.\r\nThere will be, however, as every one knows, some or even considerable\r\nvariation in the field. Some plants, even in exactly the same soil, will\r\nbe better than the average, and some will be poorer. Now we see this\r\nvariation in the plants of our field, and we believe that the plant will\r\nbe in the main like its parent. What should we learn from this? Surely\r\nthat if we wish to produce sturdy, healthy, productive plants we must go\r\ninto our fields and _pick out just such plants to secure seed from as we\r\nwish to produce another year_. If we wait until the seed is separated\r\nfrom the plant that produced it before we select our cotton seed, we\r\nshall be planting seed from poor as well as from good plants, and must\r\nbe content with a crop of just such stock as we have planted. By\r\nselecting seed from the most productive plants _in the field_ and by\r\nrepeating the selection each year, you can continually improve the breed\r\nof the plant you are raising. In selecting seed for cotton you may\r\nfollow the plan suggested below for wheat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 49 AND 50. CHRYSANTHEMUMS AND ASPARAGUS]\r\n\r\nThe difference that you see between the wild and the cultivated\r\nchrysanthemums and between the samples of asparagus shown in Figs. 49\r\nand 50 was brought about by just such continuous seed-selection from the\r\nkind of plant wanted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51. TWO VARIETIES OF FLAX FROM ONE PARENT STOCK]\r\n\r\nBy the careful selection of seed from the longest flax plants the\r\nincrease in length shown in the accompanying figure was gained. The\r\nselection of seed from those plants bearing the most seed, regardless of\r\nthe height of the plant, has produced flax like that to the right in the\r\nillustration. These two kinds of flax are from the same parent stock,\r\nbut slight differences have been emphasized by continued seed-selection,\r\nuntil we now have really two varieties of flax, one a heavy seed-bearer,\r\nthe other producing a long fiber.\r\n\r\nYou can in a similar way improve your cotton or any other seed crop.\r\nSugar beets have been made by seed-selection to produce about double the\r\npercentage of sugar that they did a few years ago. Preparing and\r\ntilling land costs too much in money and work to allow the land to be\r\nplanted with poor seed. When you are trying by seed-selection to\r\nincrease the yield of cotton, there are two principles that should be\r\nborne in mind: first, seed should be chosen only from plants that bear\r\nmany well-filled bolls of long-staple cotton; second, seed should be\r\ntaken from no plant that does not by its healthy condition show\r\nhardihood in resisting disease and drouth.\r\n\r\nThe plan of choosing seeds from selected plants may be applied to wheat;\r\nbut it would of course be too time-consuming to select enough single\r\nwheat plants to furnish all of the seed wheat for the next year. In this\r\ncase adopt the following plan: In Fig. 52 let _A_ represent the total\r\nsize of your wheat field and let _B_ represent a plat large enough to\r\nfurnish seed for the whole field. At harvest-time go into section _A_\r\nand select the best plants you can find. Pick the heads of these and\r\nthresh them by hand. The seed so obtained must be carefully saved for\r\nyour next sowing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.]\r\n\r\nIn the fall sow these selected seeds in area _B_. This area should\r\nproduce the best wheat. At the next harvest cull not from the whole\r\nfield but from the finest plants of plat _B_, and again save these as\r\nseed for plat _B_. Use the unculled seed from plat _B_ to sow your crop.\r\nBy following this plan continuously you will every year have seed from\r\nseveral generations of choice plants, and each year you will improve\r\nyour seed.\r\n\r\nIt is of course advisable to move your seed plat _B_ every year or two.\r\nFor the new plat select land that has recently been planted in legumes.\r\nAlways give this plat unwearying care.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of plants from which to get seed, you must know what\r\nkind of plants are really the best seed plants. First, _you must not\r\nregard single heads or grains, but must select seed from the most\r\nperfect plant_, looking at the plant as a whole and not at any single\r\npart of it. A first consideration is yield. Select the plants that yield\r\nbest and are at the same time resistant to drouth, resistant to rust and\r\nto winter, early to ripen, plump of grain, and nonshattering. What a\r\nfine thing it would be to find even one plant free from rust in the\r\nmidst of a rusted field! It would mean a _rust-resistant plant_. Its\r\noffspring also would probably be rust-resistant. If you should ever find\r\nsuch a plant, be sure to save its seed and plant it in a plat by itself.\r\nThe next year again save seed from those plants least rusted. Possibly\r\nyou can develop a rust-proof race of wheat! Keep your eyes open.\r\n\r\nIn England the average yield of wheat is thirty bushels an acre, in the\r\nUnited States it is less than fifteen bushels! In some states the yield\r\nis even less than nine bushels an acre. Let us select our seed with\r\ncare, as the English people do, and then we can increase our yield. By\r\ncareful seed-selection a plant-breeder in Minnesota increased the yield\r\nof his wheat by one fourth. Think what it would mean if twenty-five per\r\ncent were added to the world's supply of wheat at comparatively no cost;\r\nthat is, at the mere cost of careful seed-selection. This would mean an\r\naddition to the world's income of about $500,000,000 each year. The\r\nUnited States would get about one fifth of this profit.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that a single plant in a crop of corn, cotton, or wheat\r\nwill be far superior to all others in the field. Such a plant deserves\r\nspecial care. Do not use it merely as a seed plant, but carefully plant\r\nits seeds apart and tend carefully. The following season select the best\r\nof its offspring as favorites again. Repeat this selection and culture\r\nfor several years until you fix the variety. This is the way new\r\nvarieties are originated from plants propagated by seed.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 Mr. Abraham Fultz of Pennsylvania, while passing through a field\r\nof bearded wheat, found three heads of beardless, or bald, wheat. These\r\nhe sowed by themselves that year, and as they turned out specially\r\nproductive he continued to sow this new variety. Soon he had enough seed\r\nto distribute over the country. It became known as the Fultz wheat and\r\nis to-day one of the best varieties in the United States and in a number\r\nof foreign countries. Think how many bushels of wheat have been added to\r\nthe world's annual supply by a few moments of intelligent observation\r\nand action on the part of this one man! He saw his opportunity and used\r\nit. How many similar opportunities do you think are lost? How much does\r\nyour state or country lose thereby?\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Select one hundred seeds from a good, and one hundred from a poor,\r\n     plant of the same variety. Sow them in two plats far enough apart\r\n     to avoid cross-pollination, yet try to have soil conditions about\r\n     the same. Give each the same care and compare the yield. Try this\r\n     with corn, cotton, and wheat. Select seeds from the best plant in\r\n     your good plat and from the poorest in your poor plat and repeat\r\n     the experiment. This will require but a few feet of ground, and the\r\n     good plat will pay for itself in yield, while the poor plat will\r\n     more than pay in the lesson that it will teach you.\r\n\r\n     Write to the Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C., and to\r\n     your state experiment station for bulletins concerning\r\n     seed-selection and methods of plant-improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIX. SELECTING SEED CORN\r\n\r\nIf a farmer would raise good crops he must, as already stated, select\r\ngood seed. Many of the farmer's disappointments in the quantity and\r\nquality of his crops--disappointments often thought to come from other\r\ncauses--are the result of planting poor seed. Seeds not fully ripened,\r\nif they grow at all, produce imperfect plants. Good seed, therefore, is\r\nthe first thing necessary for a good crop. The seed of perfect plants\r\nonly should be saved.\r\n\r\nBy wise and persistent selection, made in the field before the crop is\r\nfully matured, corn can be improved in size and made to mature earlier.\r\nGather ears only from the most productive plants and save only the\r\nlargest and best kernels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53. THE KIND OF EAR TO SELECT]\r\n\r\nYou have no doubt seen the common American blackbirds that usually\r\nmigrate and feed in such large numbers. They all look alike in every\r\nway. Now, has it ever occurred to you to ask why all blackbirds are\r\nblack? The blackbirds are black simply because their parents are black.\r\n\r\nNow in the same way that the young blackbirds resemble their parents,\r\ncorn will resemble its parent stock. How many ears of corn do you find\r\non a stalk? One, two, sometimes three or four. You find two ears of corn\r\non a stalk because it is the nature of that particular stalk to produce\r\ntwo ears. In the same way the nature of some stalks is to produce but\r\none ear, while it is the nature of others sometimes to produce two or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThis resemblance of offspring to parent is known to scientists as\r\nheredity, or as \"like producing like.\"\r\n\r\nSome Southern corn-breeders take advantage of this law to improve their\r\ncorn crop. If a stalk can be made to produce two ears of corn just as\r\nlarge as the single ear that most stalks bear, we shall get twice as\r\nmuch corn from a field in which the \"two-eared\" variety is planted. In\r\nthe North and West the best varieties of corn have been selected to make\r\nbut one ear to the stalk. It is generally believed that this is the best\r\npractice for the shorter growing seasons of the colder states.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54. SELECT SEED FROM A STALK LIKE THAT ON LEFT]\r\n\r\nThese facts ought to be very helpful to us next year when our fathers\r\nare planting corn. We should get them to plant seed secured only from\r\nstalks that produced the most corn, whether the stalk had two or more\r\nears or only one. If we follow this plan year by year, each acre of land\r\nwill be made to produce more kernels and hence a larger crop of corn,\r\nand yet no more work will be required to raise the crop.\r\n\r\nIn addition to enlarging the yield of corn, you can, by proper selection\r\nof the best and most productive plants in the field, grow a new variety\r\nof seed corn. To do this you need only take the largest and best\r\nkernels from stalks bearing two ears; plant these, and at the next\r\nharvest again save the best kernels from stalks bearing the best ears.\r\nIf you keep up this practice with great care for several years, you will\r\nget a vigorous, fruitful variety that will command a high price for\r\nseed.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXPERIMENT=\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 55. IMPROVEMENT OF CORN BY SELECTION\r\n     Boone County white corn on left, and original type, from which it\r\n     was developed by selection, on right]\r\n\r\n     Every school boy and girl can make this experiment at leisure. From\r\n     your own field get two ears of corn, one from a stalk bearing only\r\n     one ear and the other from a stalk bearing two well-grown ears.\r\n     Plant the grains from one ear in one plat, and the grains from the\r\n     other in a plat of equal size. Use for both the same soil and the\r\n     same fertilizer. Cultivate both plats in the same way. When the\r\n     crop is ready to harvest, husk the corn, count the ears, and weigh\r\n     the corn. Then write a short essay on your work and on the results\r\n     and get your teacher to correct the story for your home paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XX. WEEDS\r\n\r\nHave you ever noticed that some weeds are killed by one particular\r\nmethod, but that this same method may entirely fail to kill other kinds\r\nof weeds? If we wish to free our fields of weeds with the greatest ease,\r\nwe must know the nature of each kind of weed and then attack it in the\r\nway in which we can most readily destroy it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56. PIGWEED]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary pigweed (Fig. 56) differs from many other weeds in that it\r\nlives for only one year. When winter comes, it must die. Each plant,\r\nhowever, bears a great number of seeds. If we can prevent the plant from\r\nbearing seed in its first year, there will not be many seeds to come up\r\nthe next season. In fact, only those seeds that were too deeply buried\r\nin the soil to come up the previous spring will be left, and of these\r\ntwo-year-old seeds many will not germinate. During the next season some\r\nold seeds will produce plants, but the number will be very much\r\ndiminished. If care be exercised to prevent the pigweed from seeding\r\nagain, and the same watchfulness be continued for a few seasons, this\r\nweed will be almost entirely driven from our fields.\r\n\r\nA plant like the pigweed, which lives only one year, is called an\r\n_annual_ and is one of the easiest weeds to destroy. Mustard, plantain,\r\nchess, dodder, cockle, crab grass, and Jimson weed are a few of our most\r\ndisagreeable annual weeds.\r\n\r\nThe best time to kill any weed is when it is very small; therefore the\r\nground in early spring should be constantly stirred in order to kill the\r\nyoung weeds before they grow to be strong and hardy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57. WILD CARROT]\r\n\r\nThe wild carrot differs from an annual in this way: it lives throughout\r\none whole year without producing seeds. During its first year it\r\naccumulates a quantity of nourishment in the root, then rests in the\r\nwinter. Throughout the following summer it uses this nourishment rapidly\r\nto produce its flowers and seeds. Then the plant dies. Plants that live\r\nthrough two seasons in this way are called _biennials_. Weeds of this\r\nkind may be destroyed by _cutting the roots below the leaves_ with a\r\ngrubbing-hoe or spud. A spud may be described as a chisel on a long\r\nhandle (see Fig. 58). If biennials are not cut low enough they will\r\nbranch out anew and make many seeds. Among the most common biennials are\r\nthe thistle, moth mullein, wild carrot, wild parsnip, and burdock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58. A SPUD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59. HOUND'S TONGUE]\r\n\r\nA third group of weeds consists of those that live for more than two\r\nyears. These weeds are usually most difficult to kill. They propagate by\r\nmeans of running rootstocks as well as by seeds. Plants that live more\r\nthan two seasons are known as _perennials_ and include, for example,\r\nmany grasses, dock, Canada thistle, poison ivy, passion flower, horse\r\nnettle, etc. There are many methods of destroying perennial weeds. They\r\nmay be dug entirely out and removed. Sometimes in small areas they may\r\nbe killed by crude sulphuric acid or may be starved by covering them\r\nwith boards or a straw stack or in some other convenient way. A method\r\nthat is very effective is to smother the weeds by a dense growth of\r\nsome other plant, for example, cowpeas or buckwheat. Cowpeas are to be\r\npreferred, since they also enrich the soil by the nitrogen that the\r\nroot-tubercles gather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60. CANADA THISTLE]\r\n\r\nWeeds do injury in numerous ways; they shade the crop, steal its\r\nnourishment, and waste its moisture. Perhaps their only service is to\r\nmake lazy people till their crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     You should learn to know by name the twenty worst weeds of your\r\n     vicinity and to recognize their seeds. If there are any weeds you\r\n     are not able to recognize, send a sample of each to your state\r\n     experiment station. Make a collection, properly labeled, of weeds\r\n     and weed seeds for your school.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXI. SEED PURITY AND VITALITY\r\n\r\nSeeds produce plants. The difference between a large and a small yield\r\nmay depend upon the kind of plants we raise, and the kind of plant in\r\nturn is dependent upon the seeds that we sow.\r\n\r\nTwo things are important in the selection of seeds--purity and vitality.\r\nSeeds should be _pure_; that is, when sown they should produce no other\r\nplant than the one that we wish to raise. They should be able to grow.\r\nThe ability of a seed to grow is termed its _vitality_. Good seed should\r\nbe nearly or quite pure and should possess high vitality. The vitality\r\nof seeds is expressed as a per cent; for example, if 97 seeds out of 100\r\ngerminate, or sprout, the vitality is said to be 97. The older the seed\r\nthe less is its vitality, except in a few rare instances in which seeds\r\ncannot germinate under two or three years.\r\n\r\nCucumber seeds may show 90 per cent vitality when they are one year old,\r\n75 per cent when two years old, and 70 per cent when three years\r\nold--the per cent of vitality diminishing with increase of years. The\r\naverage length of life of the seeds of cultivated plants is short: for\r\nexample, the tomato lives four years; corn, two years; the onion, two\r\nyears; the radish, five years. The cucumber seed may retain life after\r\nten years; but the seeds of this plant too lose their vitality with an\r\nincrease in years.\r\n\r\nIt is important when buying seeds to test them for purity and vitality.\r\nDealers who are not honest often sell old seeds, although they know that\r\nseeds decrease in value with age. Sometimes, however, to cloak\r\ndishonesty they mix some new seeds with the old, or bleach old and\r\nyellow seeds in order to make them resemble fresh ones.\r\n\r\nIt is important, therefore, that all seeds bought of dealers should be\r\nthoroughly examined and tested; for if they do not grow, we not only pay\r\nfor that which is useless but we are also in great danger of producing\r\nso few plants in our fields that we shall not get full use of the land,\r\nand thus we may suffer a more serious loss than merely paying for a few\r\ndead seeds. It will therefore be both interesting and profitable to\r\nlearn how to test the vitality of seeds.\r\n\r\nTo test vitality plant one hundred seeds in a pot of earth or in damp\r\nsand, or place them between moist pieces of flannel, and take care to\r\nkeep them moist and warm. Count those that germinate and thus determine\r\nthe percentage of vitality. Germinating between flannel is much quicker\r\nthan planting in earth. Care should be used to keep mice away from\r\ngerminating seeds. (See Fig. 61.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61. A SEED-GERMINATOR\r\nConsisting of two soup plates, some sand, and a piece of cloth]\r\n\r\nSometimes the appearance of a package will show whether the seed has\r\nbeen kept in stock a long time. It is, however, much more difficult to\r\nfind out whether the seeds are pure. You can of course easily\r\ndistinguish seeds that differ much from those you wish to plant, but\r\noften certain weed seeds are so nearly like certain crop seeds as not to\r\nbe easily recognized by the eye. Thus the dodder or \"love vine,\" which\r\nso often ruins the clover crop, has seeds closely resembling clover\r\nseeds. The chess, or cheat, has seeds so nearly like oats that only a\r\nclose observer can tell them apart. However, if you watch the seeds that\r\nyou buy, and study the appearance of crop seeds, you may become expert\r\nin recognizing those that have no place in your planting.\r\n\r\nOne case is reported in which a seed-dealer intentionally allowed an\r\nimpurity of 30 per cent to remain in the crop seeds, and this impurity\r\nwas mainly of weed seeds. There were 450,000 of one kind and 288,000 of\r\nanother in each pound of seed. Think of planting weeds at that rate!\r\nSometimes three fourths of the seeds you buy are weed seeds.\r\n\r\nIn purchasing seeds the only safe plan is to buy of dealers whose\r\nreputation can be relied upon.\r\n\r\nIt not seldom happens that seeds, like corn, are stored in open cribs or\r\nbarns before the moisture is entirely dried out of the seeds. Such seeds\r\nare liable to be frozen during a severe winter, and of course if this\r\nhappens they will not sprout the following spring. The only way to tell\r\nwhether such seeds have been killed is to test samples of them for\r\nvitality. Testing is easy; replanting is costly and often results in a\r\nshort crop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62. IMPURITIES IN SEEDS\r\nTube 1 represents one pound of redtop grass as bought; Tube 2, amount of\r\npure redtop grass seeds in Tube 1; Tube 3, amount of chaff and dirt in\r\nTube 1; Tube 4, amount of weed seeds in Tube 1; Tube 5, amount of total\r\nwaste in Tube 1; Tube 6, amount of pure germinable seeds in Tube 1]\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Examine seeds both for vitality and purity. Write for farmers'\r\n     bulletins on both these subjects. What would be the loss to a\r\n     farmer who planted a ten-acre clover field with seeds that were 80\r\n     per cent bad? Can you recognize the seeds of the principal\r\n     cultivated plants? Germinate some beet seeds. What per cent comes\r\n     up? Can you explain? Collect for your school as many kinds of wild\r\n     and cultivated seeds as you can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHOW TO RAISE A FRUIT TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nLet each pupil grow an apple tree this year and attempt to make it the\r\nbest in his neighborhood. In your attempt suppose you try the following\r\nplan. In the fall take the seed of an apple--a crab-apple is good--and\r\nkeep it in a cool place during the winter. The simplest way to do this\r\nis to bury it in damp sand. In the spring plant it in a rich, loose\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nGreat care must be taken of the young shoot as soon as it appears above\r\nthe ground. You want to make it grow as tall and as straight as possible\r\nduring this first year of its life, hence you should give it rich soil\r\nand protect it from animals. Before the ground freezes in the fall take\r\nup the young tree with the soil that was around it and keep it all\r\nwinter in a cool, damp place.\r\n\r\nNow when spring comes it will not do to set out the carefully tended\r\ntree, for an apple tree from seed will not be a tree like its parent,\r\nbut will tend to resemble a more distant ancestor. The distant ancestor\r\nthat the young apple tree is most likely to take after is the wild\r\napple, which is small, sour, and otherwise far inferior to the fruit we\r\nwish to grow. It makes little difference, therefore, what kind of apple\r\nseed we plant, since in any event we cannot be sure that the tree grown\r\nfrom it will bear fruit worth having unless we force it to do so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63. A YOUNG FRUIT-GROWER]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXII. GRAFTING\r\n\r\nBy a process known as _grafting_ you can force your tree to produce\r\nwhatever variety of apple you desire. Many people raise fruit trees\r\ndirectly from seed without grafting. Thus they often produce really\r\nworthless trees. By grafting they would make sure not only of having\r\ngood trees rather than poor ones but also of having the particular kind\r\nof fruit that they wish. Hence you must now graft your tree.\r\n\r\nFirst you must decide what variety of apple you want to grow on the\r\ntree. The Magnum Bonum is a great favorite as a fall apple. The Winesap\r\nis a good winter apple, while the Red Astrachan is a profitable early\r\napple, especially in the lowland of the coast region. The Northern Spy,\r\nAEsop, and Spitzenburg are also admirable kinds. Possibly some other\r\napple that you know may suit your taste and needs better than any of\r\nthese varieties.\r\n\r\nIf you have decided to raise an AEsop or a Magnum Bonum or a Winesap, you\r\nmust now cut a twig from the tree of your choice and graft it upon the\r\nlittle tree that you have raised. Choose a twig that is about the\r\nthickness of the young tree at the point where you wish to graft. Be\r\ncareful to take the shoot from a vigorous, healthy part of the tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64. TONGUE GRAFTING]\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which you may join the chosen shoot or twig upon\r\nthe young tree, but perhaps the best one for you to use is known as\r\n_tongue grafting_. This is illustrated in Fig. 64. The upper part, _b_,\r\nwhich is the shoot or twig that you cut from the tree, is known as the\r\n_scion_; the lower part, _a_, which is the original tree, is called the\r\n_stock_.\r\n\r\nCut the scion and stock as shown in Fig. 64. Join the cut end of the\r\nscion to the cut end of the stock. When you join them, notice that under\r\nthe bark of each there is a thin layer of soft, juicy tissue. This is\r\ncalled the _cambium_. To make a successful graft the cambium in the\r\nscion must exactly join the cambium in the stock. Be careful, then, to\r\nsee that cambium meets cambium. You now see why grafting can be more\r\nsuccessfully done if you select a scion and stock of nearly the same\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65. A COMPLETED GRAFT\r\nShowing scion and stock from which it was made]\r\n\r\nAfter fitting the parts closely together, bind them with cotton yarn\r\n(see Fig. 65) that has been coated with grafting wax. This wax is made\r\nof equal parts of tallow, beeswax, and linseed oil. Smear the wax\r\nthoroughly over the whole joint, and make sure that the joint is\r\ncompletely air-tight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.\r\nTo make a root graft, cut along the slanting line]\r\n\r\nThe best time to make this graft is when scion and stock are dormant,\r\nthat is, when they are not in leaf. During the winter, say in February,\r\nis the best time to graft the tree. Set the grafted tree away again in\r\ndamp sand until spring, then plant it in loose, rich soil.\r\n\r\nSince all parts growing above the graft will be of the same kind as the\r\nscion, while all branches below it will be like the stock, it is well to\r\ngraft low on the stock or even upon the root itself. The slanting double\r\nline in Fig. 66 shows the proper place to cut off for such grafting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67. A COMPLETED ROOT GRAFT]\r\n\r\nIf you like you may sometime make the interesting and valuable\r\nexperiment of grafting scions from various kinds of apple trees on the\r\nbranches of one stock. In this way you can secure a tree bearing a\r\nnumber of kinds of fruit. You may thus raise the Bonum, Red Astrachan,\r\nWinesap, and as many other varieties of apples as you wish, upon one\r\ntree. For this experiment, however, you will find it better to resort to\r\n_cleft grafting_, which is illustrated in Fig. 68.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68. CLEFT GRAFTING]\r\n\r\nLuther Burbank, the originator of the Burbank potato, in attempting to\r\nfind a variety of apple suited to the climate of California, grafted\r\nmore than five hundred kinds of apple scions on one tree, so that he\r\nmight watch them side by side and find out which kind was best suited to\r\nthat state.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXIII. BUDDING\r\n\r\nIf, instead of an apple tree, you were raising a plum or a peach tree, a\r\nform of propagation known as _budding_ would be better than grafting.\r\nOccasionally budding is also employed for apples, pears, cherries,\r\noranges, and lemons. Budding is done in the following manner. A single\r\nbud is cut from the scion and is then inserted under the bark of a\r\none-year-old peach seedling, so that the cambium of the bud and stock\r\nmay grow together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69. HOW TO CUT A BUD FROM A SCION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70. THE STEPS IN BUDDING]\r\n\r\nCut scions of the kind of fruit tree you desire from a one-year-old twig\r\nof the same variety. Wrap them in a clean, moist cloth until you are\r\nready to use them. Just before using cut the bud from the scion, as\r\nshown in Fig. 69. This bud is now ready to be inserted on the north side\r\nof the stock, just two or three inches above the ground. The north side\r\nis selected to avoid the sun. Now, as shown at _a_ in Fig. 70, make a\r\ncross and an up-and-down incision, or cut, on the stock; pull the bark\r\nback carefully, as shown in _B_; insert the bud _C_, as shown in _D_;\r\nthen fold the bark back and wrap with yarn or raffia, as shown in _E_.\r\nAs soon as the bud and branches have united, remove the wrapping to\r\nprevent its cutting the bark and cut the tree back close to the bud, as\r\nin Fig. 71, so as to force nourishment into the inserted bud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.\r\nSloping line shows where to cut tree]\r\n\r\nBudding is done in the field without disturbing the tree as it stands in\r\nthe ground. The best time to do budding is during the summer or fall\r\nmonths, when the bark is loose enough to allow the buds to be easily\r\ninserted.\r\n\r\nTrees may be budded or grafted on one another only when they are nearly\r\nrelated. Thus the apple, crab-apple, hawthorn, and quince are all\r\nrelated closely enough to graft or bud on one another; the pear grows on\r\nsome hawthorns, but not well on an apple; some chestnuts will unite with\r\nsome kinds of oaks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.\r\nLines show where to trim]\r\n\r\nBy using any of these methods you can succeed in getting with certainty\r\nthe kind of tree that you desire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOTH BUSY STORING APPLES]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXIV. PLANTING AND PRUNING\r\n\r\nThe apple tree that you grafted should be set out in the spring. Dig a\r\nhole three or four feet in diameter where you wish the tree to grow.\r\nPlace the tree in the hole and be very careful to preserve all the fine\r\nroots. Spread the roots out fully, water them, and pack fine, rich soil\r\nfirmly about them. Place stakes about the young tree to protect it from\r\ninjury. If the spot selected is in a windy location, incline the tree\r\nslightly toward the prevailing wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.\r\nPresent shape comes from pruning]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.\r\nCorrect shape]\r\n\r\nYou must prune the tree as it grows. The object of pruning is to give\r\nthe tree proper shape and to promote fruit-bearing. If the bud at the\r\nend of the main shoot grows, you will have a tall, cone-shaped tree. If,\r\nhowever, the end of the young tree be cut or \"headed back\" to the lines\r\nshown in Fig. 72, the buds below this point will be forced to grow and\r\nmake a tree like that shown in Fig. 73. The proper height of heading for\r\ndifferent fruits varies. For the apple tree a height of two or three\r\nfeet is best.\r\n\r\nCutting an end bud of a shoot or branch always sends the nourishment and\r\ngrowth into the side buds. Trimming or pinching off the side buds throws\r\nthe growth into the end bud. You can therefore cause your tree to take\r\nalmost any shape you desire. The difference between the trees shown in\r\nFigs. 73 and 74 is entirely the result of pruning. Fig. 74 illustrates\r\nin general a correctly shaped tree. It is evenly balanced, admits light\r\nfreely, and yet has enough foliage to prevent sun-scald. Figs. 75 and 76\r\nshow the effect of wisely thinning the branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.\r\nUnthinned]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.\r\nProperly thinned]\r\n\r\nThe best time to prune is either in the winter or before the buds start\r\nin the spring. Winter pruning tends to favor wood-production, while\r\nsummer pruning lessens wood-production and induces fruitage.\r\n\r\nEach particular kind of fruit requires special pruning; for example, the\r\npeach should be made to assume the shape illustrated in Fig. 77. This is\r\ndone by successive trimmings, following the plan illustrated in Figs.\r\n71, 78, 79. You will gain several advantages from these trimmings.\r\nFirst, nourishment will be forced into the peach bud that you set on\r\nyour stock. This will secure a vigorous growth of the scion. By a second\r\ntrimming take off the \"heel\" (Fig. 78, _h_) close to the tree, and thus\r\nprevent decay at this point. One year after budding you should reduce\r\nthe tree to a \"whip,\" as in Fig. 79, by trimming at the dotted line in\r\nFig. 78. This establishes the \"head\" of the tree, which in the case of\r\nthe peach should be very low,--about sixteen inches from the ground,--in\r\norder that a low foliage may lessen the danger of sun-scald to the main\r\ntrunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77. THE CUSTOMARY WAY OF PRUNING A PEACH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78. TWO-YEAR-OLD TREE\r\nCut off heel, _h_]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn pruning never leave a stump such as is shown in Fig. 78, _h_. Such a\r\nstump, having no source of nourishment, will heal very slowly and with\r\ngreat danger of decay. If this heel is cleanly cut on the line _ch_\r\n(Fig. 78), the wound will heal rapidly and with little danger of decay.\r\nLeaving such a stump endangers the soundness of the whole tree. Fig. 80\r\nshows the results of good and poor pruning on a large tree. When large\r\nlimbs are removed it is best to paint the cut surface. The paint will\r\nward off fungous disease and thus keep the tree from rotting where it\r\nwas cut.\r\n\r\nPruning that leaves large limbs branching, as in Fig. 74, _a_, is not to\r\nbe recommended, since the limbs when loaded with fruit or when beaten by\r\nheavy winds are liable to break. Decay is apt to set in at the point of\r\nbreakage. The entrance of decay-fungi through some such wound or through\r\na tiny crevice at such a crotch is the beginning of the end of many a\r\nfruitful tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79. THREE-YEAR-OLD TREE CUT BACK]\r\n\r\nSometimes a tree will go too much to wood and too little to fruit. This\r\noften happens in rich soil and may be remedied by another kind of\r\npruning known as _root-pruning_. This consists in cutting off a few of\r\nthe roots in order to limit the food supply of the plant. You ought to\r\nlearn more about root-pruning, however, before you attempt it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.\r\nRefuses to Heal--Heals promptly]\r\n\r\nHow is a peach tree made? First, the blossom appears. Then pollination\r\nand fertilization occur. The fruit ripens. The pit, or seed, is saved.\r\nIn the spring of the next year the seed is planted. The young tree,\r\nknown as the stock, comes up quickly. In August of that year a bud of\r\nthe variety which is wanted is inserted in the little stock, near the\r\nground. One year later, in the spring, the stock is cut off just above\r\nthe bud. The bud throws out a shoot, which grows to a height of about\r\nsix feet, and in the fall this little peach tree is sold as a\r\none-year-old tree. However, as is seen, the root is two years old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81. READY TO BEAR]\r\n\r\nHow is an apple tree made? The seeds are saved in the fall of one year\r\nand planted the following year. The seedlings of the apple do not grow\r\nso rapidly as those of the peach. At the end of the year they are taken\r\nup and sorted, and in the following spring they are planted. In July or\r\nAugust they are budded. In the spring of the next year the stock is cut\r\noff above the bud, and the bud-shoot grows three or four feet. One year\r\nlater the shoot branches and the top begins to form; and in the fall of\r\nthe following year the tree may be sold as a two-year-old, although most\r\npersons prefer to buy it a year later as a three-year-old. In some parts\r\nof the country, particularly in the West, the little seedling is grafted\r\nin the second winter, in a grafting room, and the young grafts are set\r\nin the nursery row in the spring to complete their growth.\r\n\r\nThe planting in the orchard of the young peach and the young apple tree\r\nis done in practically the same way. After the hole for the tree has\r\nbeen dug and after proper soil has been provided, the roots should be\r\nspread and the soil carefully packed around them.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Do you know any trees in your neighborhood that bear both wild and\r\n     budded or grafted fruit? What are the chief varieties of apples\r\n     grown in your neighborhood? grapes? currants? plums? cherries?\r\n     figs? What is a good apple tree worth? Is there any land near by\r\n     that could support a tree and is not now doing so? Examine several\r\n     orchards and see whether the trees have the proper shape. Do you\r\n     see any evidence of poor pruning? Do you find any heels? Can you\r\n     see any place where heels have resulted in rotten or hollow trees?\r\n     How could you have prevented this? Has the removal of branches ever\r\n     resulted in serious decay? How is this to be prevented?\r\n\r\n     If your home is not well stocked with all the principal kinds of\r\n     fruit, do you not want to propagate and attend to some of each\r\n     kind? You will be surprised to find how quickly trees will bear and\r\n     how soon you will be eating fruit from your own planting. Growing\r\n     your own trees will make you feel proud of your skill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nHORTICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXV. MARKET-GARDENING\r\n\r\nThe word _horticulture_ is one of those broad words under which much is\r\ngrouped. It includes the cultivation of orchard fruits, such as apples\r\nand plums; of small fruits, such as strawberries and raspberries; of\r\ngarden vegetables for the table; of flowers of all sorts, including\r\nshrubbery and ornamental trees and their arrangement into beautiful\r\nlandscape effects around our homes. Horticulture then is a name for an\r\nart that is both far-reaching and important.\r\n\r\nThe word _gardening_ is generally given to that part of horticulture\r\nwhich has for its chief aim the raising of vegetables for our tables.\r\n\r\nFlower-gardening, or the cultivation of plants valued for their bloom in\r\nmaking ornamental beds and borders and furnishing flowers for the\r\ndecoration of the home, is generally called _floriculture_.\r\nLandscape-gardening is the art of so arranging flower-beds, grass,\r\nshrubbery, and trees as to produce pleasing effects in the grounds\r\nsurrounding our homes and in great public parks and pleasure grounds.\r\n\r\nLandscape-gardening, like architecture, has developed intoll as the\r\nartist makes them on canvas, but uses natural objects in his pictures\r\ninstead of paint and canvas.\r\n\r\n=Market-Gardening.= Formerly market-gardening was done on small tracts\r\nof land in the immediate vicinity of large cities, where supplies of\r\nstable manure could be used from the city stables. But with the great\r\nincrease in the population of the cities, these small areas could no\r\nlonger supply the demand, and the introduction of commercial fertilizers\r\nand the building of railroads enabled gardeners at great distances from\r\ncity markets to grow and ship their products. Hence the markets, even in\r\nwinter, are now supplied with fresh vegetables from regions where there\r\nis no frost. Then, as spring opens, fruits and vegetables are shipped\r\nfrom more temperate regions. Later vegetables and fruits come from the\r\nsections nearer the great cities. This gradual nearing of the supply\r\nfields continues until the gardens near the cities can furnish what is\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82. STRAWBERRY-GROWING IS AN ART]\r\n\r\nThe market-gardeners around the great Northern cities, finding that\r\nwinter products were coming from the South and from warmer regions,\r\nbegan to build hothouses and by means of steam and hot-water pipes to\r\nmake warm climates in these glass houses. Many acres of land in the\r\ncolder sections of the country are covered with heated glass houses, and\r\nin them during the winter are produced fine crops of tomatoes, lettuce,\r\nradishes, cauliflowers, eggplants, and other vegetables. The degree of\r\nperfection which these attain in spite of having such artificial\r\nculture, and their freshness as compared to the products brought from a\r\ngreat distance, have made winter gardening under glass a very profitable\r\nbusiness. But it is a business that calls for the highest skill and the\r\nclosest attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83. SETTING PLANTS IN A COLD-FRAME]\r\n\r\nNo garden, even for home use, is complete without some glass sashes, and\r\nthe garden will be all the more successful if there is a small heated\r\ngreenhouse for starting plants that are afterwards to be set in the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n=Hotbeds.= If there is no greenhouse, a hotbed is an important help in\r\nthe garden. The bed is made by digging a pit two feet deep, seven feet\r\nwide, and as long as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe material for the hotbed is fresh horse manure mixed with leaves.\r\nThis is thrown into a heap to heat. As soon as steam is seen coming from\r\nthe heap the manure is turned over and piled again so that the outer\r\npart is thrown inside. When the whole is uniformly heated and has been\r\nturned two or three times, it is packed firmly into the pit already dug.\r\n\r\nA frame six feet wide, twelve inches high on the north side and eight\r\ninches on the south side and as long as the bed is to be, is now made of\r\nplank. This is set upon the heated manure, thus leaving six inches on\r\neach side outside the frame. More manure is then banked all around it,\r\nand three or four inches of fine light and rich soil are placed inside\r\nthe frame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84. THE GLADIOLUS]\r\n\r\nThe frame is then covered with hotbed sashes six feet long and three\r\nfeet wide. These slide up and down on strips of wood let into the sides\r\nof the frame. A thermometer is stuck into the soil and closely watched,\r\nfor there will be too much heat at first for sowing seed. When the heat\r\nin the early morning is about 85 deg., seeds may be sowed. The hotbed is\r\nused for starting tomato plants, eggplants, cabbage plants, and other\r\nvegetables that cannot stand exposure. It should be made about eight or\r\nten weeks before the tender plants can be set out in the locality. In\r\nthe South and Southwest it should be started earlier than in the North.\r\nFor growing the best tomato plants, and for such hardy plants as lettuce\r\nand cabbage, it will be better to have cold-frames in addition to the\r\nhotbed; these need not be more than two or three sashes.\r\n\r\n=Cold-Frames.= A cold-frame is like the frame used for a hotbed, but it\r\nis placed on well-manured soil in a sheltered spot. It is covered with\r\nthe same kind of sashes and is used for hardening the plants sowed in\r\nthe hotbed. The frame must be well banked with earth on the outside, and\r\nthe glass must be covered on cold nights with straw, mats, or old\r\ncarpets to keep out frost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85. FRAME TO CARRY THE SASH OF A HOTBED OR COLD-FRAME]\r\n\r\n=Care of Hotbed and Cold-Frame.= If the sun be allowed to shine brightly\r\non the glass of a cold-frame or hotbed, it will soon raise the\r\ntemperature in the hotbed to a point that will destroy the plants. It is\r\nnecessary, then, to pay close attention to the bed and, when the sun\r\nshines, to slip the sashes down or raise them and place a block under\r\nthe upper end to allow the steam to pass off. The cold-frame also must\r\nbe aired when the sun shines, and the sashes must be gradually slipped\r\ndown in mild weather. Finally, they may be removed entirely on sunshiny\r\ndays, so as to accustom the plants to the open air, but they must be\r\nreplaced at night. For a while before setting the plants in the open\r\ngardens, leave the sashes off night and day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86. GREENHOUSE AND COLD-FRAMES]\r\n\r\nWhile the hotbed may be used for starting plants, it is much better and\r\nmore convenient to have a little greenhouse with fire heat for this\r\npurpose. A little house with but four sashes on each side will be enough\r\nto start a great many plants, and will also give room for some flowers\r\nin pots. With such a house a student can learn to manage a more\r\nextensive structure if he gives close attention to airing, watering, and\r\nkeeping out insects.\r\n\r\n=Sowing.= The time for sowing the different kinds of seeds is an\r\nimportant matter. Seeds vary greatly in their requirements. All need\r\nthree conditions--a proper degree of heat, moisture, and air. Some\r\nseeds, like English peas, parsnips, beets, and radishes, will germinate\r\nand grow when the soil is still cool in the early spring, and peas will\r\nstand quite a frost after they are up. Therefore we plant English peas\r\nas early as the ground can be worked.\r\n\r\nBut if we should plant seeds like corn, string (or snap) beans,\r\nsquashes, and other tender plants before the ground is warm enough, they\r\nwould decay.\r\n\r\nSeeds cannot germinate in soil that is perfectly dry, for there must be\r\nmoisture to swell them and to start growth. The oxygen of the air is\r\nalso necessary, and if seeds are buried so deeply that the air cannot\r\nreach them, they will not grow, even if they are warm and moist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87. GATHERING AND SHIPPING CELERY]\r\n\r\nThe depth of planting must vary with the character and size of the seed.\r\nEnglish peas may be covered six inches deep and will be all the better\r\nfor such covering, but if corn be covered so deep, it hardly gets above\r\nthe ground. In planting small seeds like those of the radish, cabbage,\r\nturnip, lettuce, etc., a good rule is to cover them three times the\r\nthickness of the seed.\r\n\r\nIn sowing seeds when the ground is rather dry, it is a good plan, after\r\ncovering them, to tramp on the row so as to press the soil closely to\r\nthe seeds and to help it to retain moisture for germination, but do not\r\npack the soil if it is damp.\r\n\r\nIn spring never dig or plow the garden while it is still wet, but always\r\nwait until the soil is dry enough to crumble freely.\r\n\r\n=What Crops to grow.= The crops to be raised will of course depend upon\r\neach gardener's climate, surroundings, and markets. Sometimes it may pay\r\na grower, if his soil and climate are particularly suited to one crop,\r\nto expend most of his time and energy on this crop; for example, in some\r\nsections of New York, on potatoes; in parts of Michigan, on celery; in\r\nGeorgia, on watermelons; in western North Carolina, on cabbage. If\r\ncircumstances allow this sort of gardening, it has many advantages, for\r\nof course it is much easier to acquire skill in growing one crop than in\r\ngrowing many.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88. A LARGE YIELD OF CABBAGES]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it often happens that a gardener's situation requires\r\nhim to grow most of the crops known to gardening. Each gardener then\r\nmust be guided in his selection of crops by his surroundings.\r\n\r\n=Care of Crops.= The gardener who wishes to attain the greatest success\r\nin his art must do four things:\r\n\r\nFirst, he must make his land rich and keep it rich. Much of his success\r\ndepends on getting his crops on the market ahead of other growers. To do\r\nthis, his crops must grow rapidly, and crops grow rapidly only in rich\r\nsoil. Then, too, land conveniently situated for market-gardening is\r\nnearly always costly. Hence the successful market-gardener must plan to\r\nsecure the largest possible yield from as small an area as is\r\npracticable. The largest yield can of course be secured from the richest\r\nland.\r\n\r\nSecond, the gardener must cultivate his rich land most carefully and\r\neconomically. He crowds his land with products that must grow apace.\r\nTherefore he, least of all growers, can afford to have any of his soil\r\ngo to feed weeds, to have his land wash, or to have his growing crops\r\nsuffer for lack of timely and wise cultivation. To cultivate his land\r\neconomically the gardener must use the best tools and machines and the\r\nbest methods of soil management.\r\n\r\nThird, to get the best results he must grow perfect vegetables. To do\r\nthis, he must add to good tillage a knowledge of the common plant\r\ndiseases and of the ways of insects and bacterial pests; he must know\r\nhow and when to spray, how and when to treat his seed, how and when to\r\npoison, how and when to trap his insect foes and to destroy their\r\nhiding-places.\r\n\r\nFourth, not only must the gardener grow perfect vegetables, but he must\r\nput them on the market in perfect condition and in attractive shape. Who\r\ncares to buy wilted, bruised, spoiling vegetables? Gathering, bundling,\r\ncrating, and shipping are all to be watched carefully. Baskets should be\r\nneat and attractive, crates clean and snug, barrels well packed and well\r\nheaded. Careful attention to all these details brings a rich return.\r\n\r\nAmong the gardener's important crops are the following:\r\n\r\n=Asparagus.= This is a hardy plant. Its seed may be sowed either early\r\nin the spring or late in the fall. The seeds should be planted in rows.\r\nIf the plants are well cultivated during the spring and summer, they\r\nwill make vigorous roots for transplanting in the autumn.\r\n\r\nIn the fall prepare a piece of land by breaking it unusually deep and by\r\nmanuring it heavily. After the land is thoroughly prepared, make in it\r\nfurrows for the asparagus roots. These furrows should be six inches deep\r\nand three feet apart. Then remove the roots from the rows in which they\r\nhave been growing during the summer, and set them two feet apart in the\r\nprepared furrows. Cover carefully at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89. A CRATE OF ASPARAGUS]\r\n\r\nIn the following spring the young shoots must be well cultivated. In\r\norder to economize space, beets or lettuce may be grown between the\r\nasparagus rows during this first season. With the coming of cold weather\r\nthe asparagus must again be freely manured and all dead tops cut off.\r\nSome plants will be ready for market the second spring. If the bed is\r\nkept free from weeds and well manured, it will increase in\r\nproductiveness from year to year.\r\n\r\n=Beans.= The most generally planted beans are those known as string, or\r\nsnap, beans. Of the many varieties, all are sensitive to cold and hence\r\nmust not be planted until frost is over.\r\n\r\nAnother widely grown kind of bean is the lima, or butter, bean. There\r\nare two varieties of the lima bean. One is large and generally grows on\r\npoles. This kind does best in the Northern states. The other is a small\r\nbean and may be grown without poles. This kind is best suited to the\r\nwarmer climates of the Southern states.\r\n\r\n=Cabbage.= In comparatively warm climates the first crop of cabbage is\r\ngenerally grown in the following way. The seeds are sowed in beds in\r\nSeptember, and the plants grown from this sowing are in November\r\ntransplanted to ground laid off in sharp ridges. The young plants are\r\nset on the south side of the ridges in order that they may be somewhat\r\nprotected from the cold of winter. As spring comes on, the ridge is\r\npartly cut down at each working until the field is leveled, and\r\nthereafter the cultivation should be level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90. CABBAGE READY FOR SHIPMENT]\r\n\r\nEarly cabbages need heavy applications of manure. In the spring, nitrate\r\nof soda applied in the rows is very helpful.\r\n\r\nSeeds for the crop following this early crop should be sowed in March.\r\nOf course these seeds should be of a later variety than the first used.\r\nThe young plants should be transplanted as soon as they are large\r\nenough. Early cabbages are set in rows three feet apart, the plants\r\neighteen inches apart in the row. As the later varieties grow larger\r\nthan the earlier ones, the plants should be set two feet apart in the\r\nrow.\r\n\r\nIn growing late fall and winter cabbage the time of sowing varies with\r\nthe climate. For the Northern and middle states, seeding should be done\r\nduring the last of March and in April. South of a line passing west from\r\nVirginia it is hard to carry cabbages through the heat of summer and get\r\nthem to head in the fall. However, if the seeds are sowed about the\r\nfirst of August in rich and moist soil and the plants set in the same\r\nsort of soil in September, large heads can be secured for the December\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91. CELERY TRIMMED, WASHED, AND BUNCHED]\r\n\r\n=Celery.= In the extreme northern part of our country, celery seeds are\r\noften sowed in a greenhouse or hotbed. This is done in order to secure\r\nplants early enough for summer blanching. This plan, however, suits only\r\nvery cool climates.\r\n\r\nIn the middle states the seeds are usually sowed in a well-prepared bed\r\nabout April. The young plants are moved to other beds as soon as they\r\nneed room. Generally they are transplanted in July to rows prepared for\r\nthem. These should be four feet apart, and the plants should be set six\r\ninches apart in the row. The celery bed should be carefully cultivated\r\nduring the summer. In the fall, hill the stalks up enough to keep them\r\nerect. After the growing season is over dig them and set them in\r\ntrenches. The trenches should be as deep as the celery is tall, and\r\nafter the celery is put in them they should be covered with boards and\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\nIn the more southern states, celery is usually grown in beds. The beds\r\nare generally made six feet wide, and rows a foot apart are run\r\ncrosswise. The plants are set six inches apart, in September, and the\r\nwhole bed is earthed up as the season advances. Finally, when winter\r\ncomes the beds are covered with leaves or straw to prevent the plants\r\nfrom freezing. The celery is dug and bunched for market at any time\r\nduring the winter.\r\n\r\nBy means of cold-frames a profitable crop of spring celery may be\r\nraised. Have the plants ready to go into the cold-frames late in October\r\nor early in November. The soil in the frame should be made very deep.\r\nThe plants should make only a moderately rapid growth during the winter.\r\nIn the early spring they will grow rapidly and so crowd one another as\r\nto blanch well. As celery grown in this way comes on the market at a\r\ntime when no other celery can be had, it commands a good price.\r\n\r\nIn climates as warm as that of Florida, beds of celery can be raised in\r\nthis way without the protection of cold-frames. A slight freeze does not\r\nhurt celery, but a long-continued freezing spell will destroy it.\r\n\r\nSome kinds of celery seem to turn white naturally. These are called\r\nself-blanching kinds. Other kinds need to be banked with earth in order\r\nto make the stalks whiten. This kind usually gives the best and crispest\r\nstalks.\r\n\r\n=Cucumbers and Cantaloupes.= Although cucumbers and cantaloupes are very\r\ndifferent plants, they are grown in precisely the same way. Some\r\ngardeners plant them in hills. However, this is perhaps not the best\r\nplan. It is better to lay the land off in furrows six feet apart. After\r\nfilling these with well-rotted stable manure, throw soil over them. Then\r\nmake the top flat and plant the seeds. After the plants are up thin them\r\nout, leaving them a foot or more apart in the rows. Cultivate regularly\r\nand carefully until the vines cover the entire ground.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan to sow cowpeas at the last working of cantaloupes, in\r\norder to furnish some shade for the melons. As both cucumbers and\r\ncantaloupes are easily hurt by cold, they should not be planted until\r\nthe soil is warm and all danger of frost is past.\r\n\r\nCucumbers are always cut while they are green. They should never be\r\npulled from the vine, but should always be cut with a piece of the stem\r\nattached. Cantaloupes should be gathered before they turn yellow and\r\nshould be ripened in the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92. STRIPED CUCUMBER BEETLE AND LARVA\r\nAll magnified]\r\n\r\nIn some sections of the country the little striped cucumber-beetle\r\nattacks the melons and cucumbers as soon as they come up. These beetles\r\nare very active, and if their attacks are not prevented they will\r\ndestroy the tender plants. Bone dust and tobacco dust applied just as\r\nthe plants appear above the ground will prevent these attacks. This\r\ntreatment not only keeps off the beetle, but also helps the growth of\r\nthe plants.\r\n\r\n=Eggplants.= Eggplants are so tender that they cannot be transplanted\r\nlike tomatoes to cold-frames and gradually hardened to stand the cold\r\nspring air. These plants, started in a warm place, must be kept there\r\nuntil the soil to which they are to be transplanted is well warmed by\r\nthe advance of spring. After the warm weather has fully set in,\r\ntransplant them to rich soil, setting them three feet apart each way.\r\nThis plant needs much manure. If large, perfect fruit is expected, the\r\nground can hardly be made too rich.\r\n\r\nEggplants are subject to the same bacterial blight that is so\r\ndestructive to tomatoes. The only way to prevent this disease is to\r\nplant in ground not lately used for tomatoes or potatoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93. AN ONION HARVEST]\r\n\r\n=Onions.= The method of growing onions varies with the use to which it\r\nis intended to put them. To make the early sorts, which are eaten green\r\nin the spring, little onions called _sets_ are planted. These are grown\r\nfrom seeds sowed late in the spring. The seeds are sowed thickly in rows\r\nin rather poor land. The object of selecting poor land is that the\r\ngrowth of the sets may be slow. When the sets have reached the size of\r\nsmall marbles, they are ready for the fall planting.\r\n\r\nIn the South the sets may be planted in September. Plant them in rows in\r\nrich and well-fertilized soil. They will be ready for market in March\r\nor April. In the more northerly states the sets are to be planted as\r\nearly as possible in the spring.\r\n\r\nTo grow ripe onions the seeds must be sowed as early in the spring as\r\nthe ground can be worked. The plants are thinned to a stand of three\r\ninches in the rows. As they grow, the soil is drawn away from them so\r\nthat the onions sit on top of the soil with only their roots in the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94. HOTBED FOR STARTING TOMATO PLANTS]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the tops ripen pull the onions and let them lie in the sun\r\nuntil the tops are dry. Then put them under shelter. As onions keep best\r\nwith their tops attached, do not remove these until it is time for\r\nmarketing.\r\n\r\n=Peas.= The English pea is about the first vegetable of the season to be\r\nplanted. It may be planted as soon as the ground is in workable\r\ncondition. Peas are planted in rows, and it is a good plan to stretch\r\nwire netting for them to climb on. However, where peas are extensively\r\ncultivated they are allowed to fall on the ground.\r\n\r\nThere are many sorts of peas, differing both in quality and in time of\r\nproduction. The first to be planted are the extra-early varieties. These\r\nare not so fine as the later, wrinkled sorts, but the seeds are less apt\r\nto rot in cold ground. Following these, some of the fine, wrinkled sorts\r\nare to be planted in regular succession. Peas do not need much manure\r\nand do best in a light, warm soil.\r\n\r\n=Tomatoes.= There is no vegetable grown that is more widely used than\r\nthe tomato. Whether fresh or canned it is a staple article of food that\r\ncan be served in many ways.\r\n\r\nBy careful selection and breeding, the fruit of the tomato has in recent\r\nyears been much improved. There are now many varieties that produce\r\nperfectly smooth and solid fruit, and the grower can hardly go amiss in\r\nhis selection of seeds if he bears his climate and his particular needs\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\nEarly tomatoes are started in the greenhouse or in the hotbed about ten\r\nweeks before the time for setting the plants in the open ground. They\r\nare transplanted to cold-frames as soon as they are large enough to\r\nhandle. This is done to harden the plants and to give them room to grow\r\nstrong before the final transplanting.\r\n\r\nIn kitchen gardens tomatoes are planted in rows four feet apart with the\r\nplants two feet apart in the rows. They are generally trained to stakes\r\nwith but one stalk to a stake. When there is plenty of space, however,\r\nthe plants are allowed to grow at will and to tumble on the ground. In\r\nthis way they bear large crops. During the winter the markets are\r\nsupplied with tomatoes either from tropical sections or from hothouses.\r\nAs those grown in the hothouses are superior in flavor to those shipped\r\nfrom Florida and from the West Indies, and as they command good prices,\r\ngreat quantities are grown in this way.\r\n\r\nIn the South the bacterial blight which attacks the plants of this\r\nfamily is a serious drawback to tomato culture. The only way to escape\r\nthis disease is to avoid planting tomatoes on land in which eggplants,\r\ntomatoes, or potatoes have been blighted. Lime spread around the plants\r\nseems to prevent the blight for one season on some soils.\r\n\r\nAt the approach of frost in the fall, green tomatoes can easily be\r\npreserved by wrapping them in paper. Gather them carefully and wrap each\r\nseparately. Pack them in boxes and store in a cellar that is close\r\nenough to prevent the freezing of the fruit. A few days before the\r\ntomatoes are wanted for the table unpack as many as are needed, remove\r\nthe paper, and allow them to ripen in a warm room.\r\n\r\nTomatoes require a rich soil. Scattering a small quantity of nitrate of\r\nsoda around their roots promotes rapid growth.\r\n\r\n=Watermelons.= As watermelons need more room than can usually be spared\r\nin a garden, they are commonly grown as a field crop.\r\n\r\nA very light, sandy soil suits watermelons best. They can be grown on\r\nvery poor soil if a good supply of compost be placed in each hill. The\r\nland for the melons should be laid off in about ten-foot checks; that\r\nis, the furrows should cross one another at right angles about every ten\r\nfeet. A wide hole should be dug where the furrows cross, and into this\r\ncomposted manure should be put.\r\n\r\nThe best manure for watermelons is a compost of stable manure and\r\nwood-mold from the forest. Pile the manure and wood-mold in alternate\r\nlayers for some time before the planting season. During the winter cut\r\nthrough the pile several times until the two are thoroughly mixed and\r\nfinely pulverized. Be sure to keep the compost heap under shelter.\r\nCompost will lose in value if it is exposed to rains.\r\n\r\nAt planting-time, put two or three shovelfuls of this compost into each\r\nof the prepared holes, and over the top of the manure scatter a handful\r\nof any high-grade complete fertilizer. Then cover fertilizer and manure\r\nwith soil, and plant the seeds in this soil. In cultivating, plow both\r\nways of the checked rows and throw the earth toward the plants.\r\n\r\nSome growers pinch off the vines when they have grown about three feet\r\nlong. This is done to make them branch more freely, but the pinching is\r\nnot necessary.\r\n\r\nA serious disease, the watermelon wilt, is rapidly spreading through\r\nmelon-growing sections. This disease is caused by germs in the soil, and\r\nthe germs are hard to kill. If the wilt should appear in your\r\nneighborhood, do not allow any stable manure to be used on your melon\r\nland, for the germs are easily scattered by means of stable manure. The\r\ngerms also cling to the seeds of diseased melons, and these seeds bear\r\nthe disease to other fields. If you treat melon seeds as you are\r\ndirected on page 135 to treat oat seeds, the germs on the seeds will be\r\ndestroyed. By crossing the watermelon on the citron melon, a watermelon\r\nthat is resistant to wilt has recently been developed and successfully\r\ngrown in soils in which wilt is present. The new melon, inferior in\r\nflavor at first, is being improved from season to season and bids fair\r\nto rival other melons in flavor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95. DEWBERRIES]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXVI. FLOWER GARDENING\r\n\r\nThe comforts and joys of life depend largely upon small things. Of these\r\nsmall things perhaps none holds a position of greater importance in\r\ncountry life than the adornment of the home, indoors and outdoors, with\r\nflowers tastefully arranged. Their selection and planting furnish\r\npleasant recreation; their care is a pleasing employment; and each\r\nlittle plant, as it sprouts and grows and develops, may become as much a\r\npet as creatures of the sister animal kingdom. A beautiful, well-kept\r\nyard adds greatly to the pleasure and attractiveness of a country home.\r\nIf a beautiful yard and home give joy to the mere passer-by, how much\r\nmore must their beauty appeal to the owners. The decorating of the home\r\nshows ambition, pride, and energy--important elements in a successful\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96. AN EASY WAY TO BEAUTIFY THE HOME]\r\n\r\nPlant trees and shrubs in your yard and border your masses of shrubbery\r\nwith flower-beds. Do not disfigure a lawn by placing a bed of flowers in\r\nit. Use the flowers rather to decorate the shrubbery, and for borders\r\nalong walks, and in the corners near steps, or against foundations.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to raise flowers for the sake of flowers, not as\r\ndecorations, make the flower-beds in the back yard or at the side of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97. A BACK YARD TO REFINE THE CHILDREN OF THE\r\nFAMILY]\r\n\r\nPlants may be grown from seeds or from bulbs or from cuttings. The\r\nrooting of cuttings is an interesting task to all who are fond of\r\nflowers. Those who have no greenhouse and who wish to root cuttings of\r\ngeraniums, roses, and other plants may do so in the following way. Take\r\na shallow pan, an old-fashioned milk pan for instance, fill it nearly\r\nfull of clean sand, and then wet the sand thoroughly. Stick the cuttings\r\nthickly into this wet sand, set the pan in a warm, sunny window, and\r\nkeep the sand in the same water-soaked condition. Most cuttings will\r\nroot well in a few weeks and may then be set into small flower-pots.\r\nCuttings of tea roses should have two or three joints and be taken from\r\na stem that has just made a flower. Allow one of the rose leaves to\r\nremain at the top of the cutting. Stick this cutting into the sand and\r\nit will root in about four weeks. Cuttings of Cape jasmine may be rooted\r\nin the same way. Some geraniums, the rose geranium for example, may be\r\ngrown from cuttings of the roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98. REPOTTING]\r\n\r\nBulbs are simply the lower ends of the leaves of a plant wrapped tightly\r\naround one another and inclosing the bud that makes the future\r\nflower-stalk. The hyacinth, the narcissus, and the common garden onion\r\nare examples of bulbous plants. The flat part at the bottom of the bulb\r\nis the stem of the plant reduced to a flat disk, and between each two\r\nadjacent leaves on this flat stem there is a bud, just as above-ground\r\nthere is a bud at the base of a leaf. These buds on the stem of the bulb\r\nrarely grow, however, unless forced to do so artificially. The number\r\nof bulbs may be greatly increased by making these buds grow and form\r\nother bulbs. In increasing hyacinths the matured bulbs are dug in the\r\nspring, and the under part of the flat stem is carefully scraped away to\r\nexpose the base of the buds. The bulbs are then put in heaps and covered\r\nwith sand. In a few weeks each bud has formed a little bulb. The\r\ngardener plants the whole together to grow one season, after which the\r\nlittle bulbs are separated and grown into full-sized bulbs for sale.\r\nOther bulbs, like the narcissus or the daffodil, form new bulbs that\r\nseparate without being scraped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99. A CLEMATIS]\r\n\r\nThere are some other plants which have underground parts that are\r\ncommonly called bulbs but which are not bulbs at all; for example, the\r\ngladiolus and the caladium, or elephant's ear. Their underground parts\r\nare bulblike in shape, but are really solid flattened stems with eyes\r\nlike the underground stem of the Irish potato. These parts are called\r\n_corms_. They may be cut into pieces like the potato and each part will\r\ngrow.\r\n\r\nThe dahlia makes a mass of roots that look greatly like sweet potatoes,\r\nbut there are no eyes on them as there are on the sweet potato. The only\r\neyes are on the base of the stem to which they are joined. They may be\r\nsprouted like sweet potatoes and then soft cuttings made of the green\r\nshoots, after which they may be rooted in the greenhouse and later\r\nplanted in pots.\r\n\r\nThere are many perennial plants that will bloom the first season when\r\ngrown from the seed, though such seedlings are seldom so good as the\r\nplants from which they came. They are generally used to originate new\r\nvarieties. Seeds of the dahlia, for instance, can be sowed in a box in a\r\nwarm room in early March, potted as soon as the plants are large enough\r\nto handle, and finally planted in the garden when the weather is warm.\r\nThey will bloom nearly as soon as plants grown by dividing the roots or\r\nfrom cuttings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100. OUTDOOR-GROWN CHRYSANTHEMUMS]\r\n\r\nIn growing annual plants from seed, there is little difficulty if the\r\ngrower has a greenhouse or a hotbed with a glass sash. Even without\r\nthese the plants may be grown in shallow boxes in a warm room. The best\r\nboxes are about four inches deep with bottoms made of slats nailed a\r\nquarter of an inch apart to give proper drainage. Some moss is laid over\r\nthe bottom to prevent the soil from sifting through. The boxes should\r\nthen be filled with light, rich soil. Fine black forest mold, thoroughly\r\nmixed with one fourth its bulk of well-rotted manure, makes the best\r\nsoil for filling the seed-boxes. If this soil be placed in an oven and\r\nheated very hot, the heat will destroy many weeds that would otherwise\r\ngive trouble. After the soil is put in the boxes it should be well\r\npacked by pressing it with a flat wooden block. Sow the seeds in\r\nstraight rows, and at the ends of the rows put little wooden labels with\r\nthe names of the flowers on them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101. THE CARNATION (ELDORADO)]\r\n\r\nSeeds sowed in the same box should be of the same general size in order\r\nthat they may be properly covered, for seeds need to be covered\r\naccording to their size. After sowing the seed, sift the fine soil over\r\nthe surface of the box. The best soil for covering small seeds is made\r\nby rubbing dry moss and leaf-mold through a sieve together. This makes a\r\nlight cover that will not bake and will retain moisture. After covering\r\nthe seeds, press the soil firm and smooth with a wooden block. Now\r\nsprinkle the covering soil lightly with a watering-pot until it is\r\nfairly moistened. Lay some panes of glass over the box to retain the\r\nmoisture, and avoid further watering until moisture becomes absolutely\r\nnecessary. Too much watering makes the soil too compact and rots the\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the seedlings have made a second pair of leaves, take them up\r\nwith the point of a knife and transplant them into other boxes filled in\r\nthe same way. They should be set two inches apart so as to give them\r\nroom to grow strong. They may be transplanted from the boxes to the\r\nflower-garden by taking an old knife-blade and cutting the earth into\r\nsquares, and then lifting the entire square with the plant and setting\r\nit where it is wanted.\r\n\r\nThere are many flower-seeds which are so small that they must not be\r\ncovered at all. In this class we find begonias, petunias, and Chinese\r\nprimroses. To sow these prepare boxes as for the other seeds, and press\r\nthe earth smooth. Then scatter some fine, dry moss thinly over the\r\nsurface of the soil. Sprinkle this with water until it is well\r\nmoistened, and at once scatter the seeds thinly over the surface and\r\ncover the boxes with panes of glass until the seeds germinate.\r\nTransplant as soon as the young plants can be lifted out separately on\r\nthe blade of a penknife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102. THE POET'S NARCISSUS]\r\n\r\nMany kinds of flower-seeds may be sowed directly in the open ground\r\nwhere they are to remain. The sweet pea is one of the most popular\r\nflowers grown in this way. The seeds should be sowed rather thickly in\r\nrows and covered fully four inches deep. The sowing should be varied in\r\ntime according to the climate. From North Carolina southward, sweet peas\r\nmay be sowed in the fall or in January, as they are very hardy and\r\nshould be forced to bloom before the weather becomes hot. Late spring\r\nsowing will not give fine flowers in the South. From North Carolina\r\nnorthward the seeds should be sowed just as early in the spring as the\r\nground can be easily worked. When the plants appear, stakes should be\r\nset along the rows and a strip of woven-wire fence stretched for the\r\nplants to climb on. Morning-glory seeds are also sowed where they are to\r\ngrow. The seeds of the moonflower are large and hard and will fail to\r\ngrow unless they are slightly cut. To start their growth make a slight\r\ncut just through the hard outer coat of the seed so as to expose the\r\nwhite inside. In this way they will grow very readily. The seeds of the\r\ncanna, or Indian-shot plant, are treated in a similar way to start them\r\ngrowing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103. A CYCLAMEN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104. A MODERN SWEET PEA]\r\n\r\nThe canna makes large fleshy roots which in the North are taken up,\r\ncovered with damp moss, and stored under the benches of the greenhouse\r\nor in a cellar. If allowed to get too dry, they will wither. From\r\ncentral North Carolina south it is best to cover them up thickly with\r\ndead leaves and let them stay in the ground where they grew. In the\r\nearly spring take them up and divide for replanting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105. DAHLIAS]\r\n\r\nPerennial plants, such as our flowering shrubs, are grown from cuttings\r\nof the ripe wood after the leaves have fallen in autumn. From North\r\nCarolina southward these cuttings should be set in rows in the fall.\r\nCuttings ten inches long are set so that the tops are just even with the\r\nground. A light cover of pine leaves will prevent damage from frost.\r\nFarther north the cuttings should be tied in bundles and well buried in\r\nthe ground with earth heaped over them. In the spring set them in rows\r\nfor rooting. In the South all the hardy hybrid perpetual roses can be\r\ngrown in this way, and in any section the cuttings of most of the\r\nspring-flowering shrubs will grow in the same manner. The Japanese\r\nquince, which makes such a show of its scarlet flowers in early spring,\r\ncan be best grown from three-inch cuttings made of the roots and planted\r\nin rows in the fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106. FOUR-O'CLOCKS SET IN A GOOD PLACE]\r\n\r\nMany of our ornamental evergreen trees, such as the arbor vitae, can be\r\ngrown in the spring from seeds sowed in a frame. Cotton cloth should be\r\nstretched over the trees while they are young, to prevent the sun from\r\nscorching them. When a year old they may be set in nursery rows to\r\ndevelop until they are large enough to plant. Arbor vitae may also be\r\ngrown from cuttings made by setting young tips in boxes of sand in the\r\nfall and keeping them warm and moist through the winter. Most of them\r\nwill be rooted by spring.\r\n\r\nThe kinds of flowers that you can grow are almost countless. You can\r\nhardly make a mistake in selecting, as all are interesting. Start this\r\nyear with a few and gradually increase the number under your care year\r\nby year, and aim always to make your plants the choicest of their kind.\r\n\r\nOf annuals there are over four hundred kinds cultivated. You may select\r\nfrom the following list: phlox, petunias, China asters, California\r\npoppies, sweet peas, pinks, double and single sunflowers, hibiscus,\r\ncandytuft, balsams, morning-glories, stocks, nasturtiums, verbenas,\r\nmignonette.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107. A WINDOW BOX]\r\n\r\nOf perennials select bleeding-hearts, pinks, bluebells, hollyhocks,\r\nperennial phlox, perennial hibiscus, wild asters, and goldenrods. From\r\nbulbs choose crocus, tulip, daffodil, narcissus, lily of the valley, and\r\nlily.\r\n\r\nSome climbers are cobaea, honeysuckle, Virginia creeper, English ivy,\r\nBoston ivy, cypress vine, hyacinth bean, climbing nasturtiums, and\r\nroses.\r\n\r\nTo make your plants do best, cultivate them carefully. Allow no weeds to\r\ngrow among them and do not let the surface of the soil dry into a hard\r\ncrust. Beware, however, of stirring the soil too deep. Loosening the\r\nsoil about the roots interrupts the feeding of the plant and does harm.\r\nClimbing plants may be trained to advantage on low woven-wire fences.\r\nThese are especially serviceable for sweet peas and climbing\r\nnasturtiums. Do not let the plants go to seed, since seeding is a heavy\r\ndrain on nourishment. Moreover, the plant has served its end when it\r\nseeds and is ready then to stop blossoming. You should therefore pick\r\noff the old flowers to prevent their developing seeds. This will cause\r\nmany plants which would otherwise soon stop blossoming to continue\r\nbearing flowers for a longer period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108. A WINDOW-GARDEN]\r\n\r\n=Window-Gardening.= Growing plants indoors in the window possesses many\r\nof the attractions of outdoor flower-gardening, and is a means of\r\nbeautifying the room at very small expense. Especially do window-gardens\r\ngive delight during the barren winter time. They are a source of culture\r\nand pleasure to thousands who cannot afford extended and expensive\r\nornamentation.\r\n\r\nThe window-garden may vary in size from an eggshell holding a minute\r\nplant to boxes filling all the available space about the window. The\r\nsoil may be in pots for individual plants or groups of plants or in\r\nboxes for collections of plants. You may raise your flowers inside of\r\nthe window on shelves or stands, or you may have a set of shelves built\r\noutside of the window and inclosed in glazed sashes. The illustration on\r\npage 119 gives an idea of such an external window-garden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109. AN INSIDE WINDOW BOX IN ITS FULL GLORY]\r\n\r\nThe soil must be rich and loose. The best contains some undecayed\r\norganic matter such as leaf-mold or partly decayed sods and some sand.\r\nRaise your plants from bulbs, cuttings, or seed, just as in outdoor\r\ngardens. Some plants do better in cool rooms, others in a warmer\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110. MAKING THE OUTSIDE OF A WINDOW BLOOM]\r\n\r\nIf the temperature ranges from 35 deg. to 70 deg., averaging about 55 deg., azaleas,\r\ndaisies, carnations, candytuft, alyssum, dusty miller, chrysanthemums,\r\ncinerarias, camellias, daphnes, geraniums, petunias, violets, primroses,\r\nand verbenas make especially good growths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BEAUTIFUL WINDOW FLOWER]\r\n\r\nIf the temperature is from 50 deg. to 90 deg., averaging 70 deg., try abutilon,\r\nbegonia, bouvardia, caladium, canna, Cape jasmine, coleus, fuchsia,\r\ngloxinia, heliotrope, lantana, lobelia, roses, and smilax.\r\n\r\nIf your box or window is shaded a good part of the time, raise begonias,\r\ncamellias, ferns, and Asparagus Sprengeri.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111. FERNS FOR BOTH INDOORS AND OUTDOORS]\r\n\r\nWhen the soil is dry, water it; then apply no more water until it again\r\nbecomes dry. Beware of too much water. The plants should be washed\r\noccasionally with soapsuds and then rinsed. If red spiders are present,\r\nsponge them off with water as hot as can be borne comfortably by the\r\nhand. Newspapers afford a good means of keeping off the cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE DISEASES OF PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXVII. THE CAUSE AND NATURE OF PLANT DISEASE\r\n\r\nPlants have diseases just as animals do; not the same diseases, to be\r\nsure, but just as serious for the plant. Some of them are so dangerous\r\nthat they kill the plant; others partly or wholly destroy its usefulness\r\nor its beauty. Some diseases are found oftenest on very young plants,\r\nothers prey on the middle-aged tree, while still others attack merely\r\nthe fruit. Whenever a farmer or fruit-grower has disease on his plants,\r\nhe is sure to lose much profit.\r\n\r\nYou have all seen rotten fruit. This is diseased fruit. Fruit rot is a\r\nplant disease. It costs farmers millions of dollars annually. A\r\nfruit-grower recently lost sixty carloads of peaches in a single year\r\nthrough rot which could have been largely prevented if he had known how.\r\n\r\nMany of the yellowish or discolored spots on leaves are the result of\r\ndisease, as is also the smut of wheat, corn, and oats, the blight of the\r\npear, and the wilt of cotton. Many of these diseases are contagious, or,\r\nas we often hear said of measles, \"catching.\" This is true, among\r\nothers, of the apple and peach rots. A healthy apple can catch this\r\ndisease from a sick apple. You often see evidence of this in the apple\r\nbin. So, too, many of the diseases found in the field or garden are\r\ncontagious.\r\n\r\nSometimes when the skin of a rotten apple has been broken you will find\r\nin the broken place a blue mold. It was this that caused the apple to\r\ndecay. This mold is a living plant; very small, certainly, but\r\nnevertheless a plant. Let us learn a little about molds, in order that\r\nwe may better understand our apple and potato rots, as well as other\r\nplant diseases.\r\n\r\nIf you cut a lemon and let it stand for a day or two, there will\r\nprobably appear a blue mold like that you have seen on the surface of\r\ncanned fruit. Bread also sometimes has this blue mold; at other times\r\nbread has a black mold, and yet again a pink or a yellow mold.\r\n\r\nThese and all other molds are tiny living plants. Instead of seeds they\r\nproduce many very small bodies that serve the purpose of seeds and\r\nreproduce the mold. These are called _spores_. Fig. 112 shows how they\r\nare borne on the parent plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112. TANGLED THREADS OF BLUE MOLD\r\nThe single stalk on the left shows how spores are borne]\r\n\r\nIt is also of great importance to decide whether by keeping the spores\r\naway we may prevent mold. Possibly this experiment will help us. Moisten\r\na piece of bread, then dip a match or a pin into the blue mold on a\r\nlemon, and draw the match across the moist bread. You will thus plant\r\nthe spores in a row, though they are so small that perhaps you may not\r\nsee any of them. Place the bread in a damp place for a few days and\r\nwatch it. Does the mold grow where you planted it? Does it grow\r\nelsewhere? This experiment should prove to you that molds are living\r\nthings and can be planted. If you find spots elsewhere, you must bear in\r\nmind that these spores are very small and light and that some of them\r\nwere probably blown about when you made your sowing. When you touch the\r\nmoldy portion of a dry lemon, you see a cloud of dust rise. This dust is\r\nmade of millions of spores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113. MAGNIFIED ROSE MILDEW]\r\n\r\nIf you plant many other kinds of mold you will find that the molds come\r\ntrue to the kind that is planted; that like produces like even among\r\nmolds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114. A MILDEWED ROSE]\r\n\r\nYou can prove, also, that the mold is caused only by other mold. To do\r\nthis, put some wet bread in a wide-mouthed bottle and plug the mouth of\r\nthe bottle with cotton. Kill all the spores that may be in this bottle\r\nby steaming it an hour in a cooking-steamer. This bread will not mold\r\nuntil you allow live mold from the outside to enter. If, however, at any\r\ntime you open the bottle and allow spores to enter, or if you plant\r\nspores therein, and if there be moisture enough, mold will immediately\r\nset in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115. A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED SECTION OF DISEASED PEAR LEAF\r\nShowing how spores are borne]\r\n\r\nThe little plants which make up these molds are called _fungi_. Some\r\nfungi, such as the toadstools, puffballs, and devil's snuff-box, are\r\nquite large; others, namely the molds, are very small; and others are\r\neven smaller than the molds. Fungi never have the green color of\r\nordinary plants, always reproduce by spores, and feed on living matter\r\nor matter that was once alive. Puffballs, for example, are found on\r\nrotting wood or dead twigs or roots. Some fungi grow on living plants,\r\nand these produce plant disease by taking their nourishment from the\r\nplant on which they grow; the latter plant is called the _host_.\r\n\r\nThe same blue mold that grows on bread often attacks apples that have\r\nbeen slightly bruised; it cannot pierce healthy apple skin. You can\r\nplant the mold in the bruised apple just as you did on bread and watch\r\nits rapid spread through the apple. You learn from this the need of\r\npreventing bruised or decayed apples from coming in contact with healthy\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116. SPORES OF THE PEAR SCAB\r\nThe spores are borne on stalks]\r\n\r\nJust as the fungus studied above lives in the apple or bread, so other\r\nvarieties live on leaves, bark, etc. Fig. 113 represents the surface of\r\na mildewed rose leaf greatly magnified. This mildew is a fungus. You can\r\nsee its creeping stems, its upright stalk, and numerous spores ready to\r\nfall off and spread the disease with the first breath of wind. You must\r\nremember that this figure is greatly magnified, and that the whole\r\nportion shown in the figure is only about one tenth of an inch across.\r\nFig. 114 shows the general appearance of a twig affected by this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nMildew on the rose or on any other plant may be killed by spraying the\r\nleaves with a solution of liver of sulphur; to make this solution, use\r\none ounce of the liver of sulphur to two gallons of water.\r\n\r\nThe fungus that causes the pear-leaf spots has its spores in little pits\r\n(Fig. 115). The spores of some fungi also grow on stalks, as shown in\r\nFig. 116. This figure represents an enlarged view of the pear scab,\r\nwhich causes so much destruction.\r\n\r\nYou see, then, that fungi are living plants that grow at the expense of\r\nother plants and cause disease. Now if you can cover the leaf with a\r\npoison that will kill the spore when it comes, you can prevent the\r\ndisease. One such poison is the Bordeaux (_bor-do_') mixture, which\r\nhas proved of great value to farmers.\r\n\r\nSince the fungus in most cases lives within the leaves, the poison on\r\nthe outside does no good after the fungus is established. The treatment\r\ncan be used only to _prevent_ attack, not to cure, except in the case of\r\na few mildews that live on the outside of the leaf, as does the rose\r\nmildew.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Why do things mold more readily in damp places? Do you now\r\n     understand why fruit is heated before it is canned? Try to grow\r\n     several kinds of mold. Do you know any fungi which may be eaten?\r\n\r\n     Transfer disease from a rotten apple to a healthy one and note the\r\n     rapidity of decay. How many really healthy leaves can you find on a\r\n     strawberry plant? Do you find any spots with reddish borders and\r\n     white centers? Do you know that this is a serious disease of the\r\n     strawberry? What damage does fruit mold do to peaches, plums, or\r\n     strawberries?\r\n\r\n     Write to your experiment station for bulletins on plant diseases\r\n     and methods for making and using spraying mixtures.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXVIII. YEAST AND BACTERIA\r\n\r\nCan you imagine a plant so small that it would take one hundred plants\r\nlying side by side to equal the thickness of a sheet of writing-paper?\r\nThere are plants that are so small. Moreover, these same plants are of\r\nthe utmost importance to man. Some of them do him great injury, while\r\nothers aid him very much.\r\n\r\nYou will see their importance when you are told that certain of them in\r\ntheir habits of life cause great change in the substances in which they\r\nlive. For example, when living in a sugary substance they change the\r\nsugar into a gas and an alcohol. Do you remember the bright bubbles of\r\ngas you have seen rising in sweet cider or in wine as it soured? These\r\nbubbles are caused by one of these small plants--the yeast plant. As the\r\nyeast plant grows in the sweet fruit juice, alcohol is made and a gas is\r\ngiven off at the same time, and this gas makes the bubbles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117. YEAST PLANTS\r\n_A_, a single plant; _B_, group of two budding cells; _C_, group of\r\nseveral cells]\r\n\r\nLater, other kinds of plants equally small will grow and change the\r\nalcohol into an acid which you will recognize as vinegar by its sour\r\ntaste and peculiar odor. Thus vinegar is made by the action of two\r\ndifferent kinds of little living plants in the cider. That these are\r\nliving beings you can prove by heating the cider and keeping it tightly\r\nsealed so that nothing can enter it. You will find that because the\r\nliving germs have been killed by the heat, the cider will not ferment or\r\nsour as it did before. The germs could of course be killed by poisons,\r\nbut then the cider would be unfit for use. It is this same little yeast\r\nplant that causes bread to rise.\r\n\r\nWhen you see any decaying matter you may know that in it minute plants\r\nmuch like the yeast plant are at work. Since decay is due to them, we\r\ntake advantage of the fact that they cannot grow in strong brine or\r\nsmoke; and we prepare meat for keeping by salting it or by smoking it or\r\nby both of these methods.\r\n\r\nYou see that some of the yeast plants and _bacteria_, as many of these\r\nforms are called, are very friendly to us, while others do us great\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nSome bacteria grow within the bodies of men and other animals or in\r\nplants. When they do so they may produce disease. Typhoid fever,\r\ndiphtheria, consumption, and many other serious diseases are caused by\r\nbacteria. Fig. 118, _e_, shows the bacterium that causes typhoid fever.\r\nIn the picture, of course, it is very greatly magnified. In reality\r\nthese bacteria are so small that about twenty-five thousand of them side\r\nby side would extend only one inch. These small beings produce their\r\ngreat effects by very rapid multiplication and by giving off powerful\r\npoisons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118. FORMS OF BACTERIA\r\n_a_, grippe; _b_, bubonic plague; _c_, diphtheria; _d_, tuberculosis;\r\n_e_, typhoid fever]\r\n\r\nBacteria are so small that they are readily borne on the dust particles\r\nof the air and are often taken into the body through the breath and also\r\nthrough water or milk. You can therefore see how careful you should be\r\nto prevent germs from getting into the air or into water or milk when\r\nthere is disease about your home. You should heed carefully all\r\ninstructions of your physician on this point, so that you may not spread\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXIX. PREVENTION OF PLANT DISEASE\r\n\r\nIn the last two sections you have learned something of the nature of\r\nthose fungi and bacteria that cause disease in animals and plants. Now\r\nlet us see how we can use this knowledge to lessen the diseases of our\r\ncrops. Farmers lose through plant diseases much that could be saved by\r\nproper precaution.\r\n\r\nFirst, you must remember that every diseased fruit, twig, or leaf bears\r\nmillions of spores. These must be destroyed by burning. They must not be\r\nallowed to lie about and spread the disease in the spring. See that\r\ndecayed fruit in the bin or on the trees is destroyed in the same\r\nmanner. Never throw decayed fruit into the garden or orchard, as it may\r\ncause disease the following year.\r\n\r\nSecond, you can often kill spores on seeds before they are planted and\r\nthus prevent the development of the fungus (see pp. 134-137).\r\n\r\nThird, often the foliage of the plant can be sprayed with a poison that\r\nwill prevent the germination of the spores (see pp. 138-140).\r\n\r\nFourth, some varieties of plants resist disease much more stoutly than\r\nothers. We may often select the resistant form to great advantage (see\r\nFig. 119).\r\n\r\nFifth, after big limbs are pruned off, decay often sets in at the wound.\r\nThis decay may be prevented by coating the cut surface with paint, tar,\r\nor some other substance that will not allow spores to enter the wound or\r\nto germinate there.\r\n\r\nSixth, it frequently happens that the spore or fungus remains in the\r\nsoil. This is true in the cotton wilt, and the remedy is so to rotate\r\ncrops that the diseased land is not used again for this crop until the\r\nspores or fungi have died.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXX. SOME SPECIAL PLANT DISEASES\r\n\r\n=Fire-Blight of the Pear and Apple.= You have perhaps heard your father\r\nspeak of the \"fire-blight\" of pear and apple trees. This is one of the\r\nmost injurious and most widely known of fruit diseases. Do you want to\r\nknow the cause of this disease and how to prevent it?\r\n\r\nFirst, how will you recognize this disease? If the diseased bough at\r\nwhich you are looking has true fire-blight, you will see a blackened\r\ntwig with withered, blackened leaves. During winter the leaves do not\r\nfall from blighted twigs as they do from healthy ones. The leaves wither\r\nbecause of the diseased twig, not because they are themselves diseased.\r\nOnly rarely does the blight really enter the leaf. Sometimes a sharp\r\nline separates the blighted from the healthy part of the twig.\r\n\r\nThis disease is caused by bacteria, of which you have read in another\r\nsection. The fire-blight bacteria grow in the juicy part of the stem,\r\nbetween the wood and the bark. This tender, fresh layer (as explained on\r\npage 79) is called the _cambium_, and is the part that breaks away and\r\nallows you to slip the bark off when you make your bark whistle in the\r\nspring. The growth of new wood takes place in the cambium, and this part\r\nof the twig is therefore full of nourishment. If this nourishment is\r\nstolen the plant of course soon suffers.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria causing fire-blight are readily carried from flower to\r\nflower and from twig to twig by insects; therefore to keep these and\r\nother bacteria away from your trees you must see to it that all the\r\ntrees in the neighborhood of your orchard are kept free from mischievous\r\nenemies. If harmful bacteria exist in near-by trees, insects will carry\r\nthem to your orchard. You must therefore watch all the relatives of the\r\npear; namely, the apple, hawthorn, crab, quince, and mountain ash, for\r\nany of these trees may harbor the germs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119. A RESISTANT VARIETY OF SEA ISLAND COTTON\r\nAll the other plants in this field died. This one row lived because it\r\ncould resist the cotton wilt]\r\n\r\nWhen any tree shows blight, every diseased twig on it must be cut off\r\nand burned in order to kill the germs, and you must cut low enough on\r\nthe twig to get all the bacteria. It is best to cut a foot below the\r\nblackened portion. If by chance your knife should cut into wood\r\ncontaining the living germs, and then you should cut into healthy wood\r\nwith the same knife, you yourself would spread the disease. It is\r\ntherefore best after each cutting to dip your knife into a solution of\r\ncarbolic acid. This will kill all bacteria clinging to the knife-blade.\r\nThe surest time to do complete trimming is after the leaves fall in the\r\nautumn, as diseased twigs are most easily recognized at that time, but\r\nthe orchard should be carefully watched in the spring also. If a large\r\nlimb shows the blight, it is perhaps best to cut the tree entirely down.\r\nThere is little hope for such a tree.\r\n\r\nA large pear-grower once said that no man with a sharp knife need fear\r\nthe fire-blight. Yet our country loses greatly by this disease each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120. FIRE-BLIGHT BACTERIA\r\nMagnified]\r\n\r\nIt may be added that winter pruning tends to make the tree form much new\r\nwood and thus favors the disease. Rich soil and fertilizers make it much\r\neasier in a similar way for the tree to become a prey to blight.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Ask your teacher to show you a case of fire-blight on a pear or\r\n     apple tree. Can you distinguish between healthy and diseased wood?\r\n     Cut the twig open lengthwise and see how deep into the wood and how\r\n     far down the stem the disease extends. Can you tell surely from the\r\n     outside how far the twig is diseased? Can you find any twig that\r\n     does not show a distinct line of separation between diseased and\r\n     healthy wood? If so, the bacteria are still living in the cambium.\r\n     Cut out a small bit of the diseased portion and insert it under the\r\n     bark of a healthy, juicy twig within a few inches of its tip and\r\n     watch it from day to day. Does the tree catch the disease? This\r\n     experiment may prove to you how easily the disease spreads. If you\r\n     should see any drops like dew hanging from diseased twigs, touch a\r\n     little of this moisture to a healthy flower and watch for results.\r\n\r\n     Cut and burn all diseased twigs that you can find. Estimate the\r\n     damage done by fire-blight.\r\n\r\n     Farmers' bulletins on orchard enemies are published by the\r\n     Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C., and can be had by\r\n     writing for them. They will help your father much in treating\r\n     fire-blight.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oat Smuts.= Let us go out into a near-by oat field and look for all the\r\nblackened heads of grain that we can find. How many are there? To count\r\naccurately let us select an area one foot square. We must look\r\ncarefully, for many of these blackened heads are so low that we shall\r\nnot see them at the first glance. You will be surprised to find as many\r\nas thirty or forty heads in every hundred so blackened. These blackened\r\nheads are due to a plant disease called _smut_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121. LOOSE SMUT OF OATS\r\nThe glumes at _a_ more nearly destroyed than the glumes at _b_]\r\n\r\nWhen threshing-time comes you will notice a great quantity of black dust\r\ncoming from the grain as it passes through the machine. The air is full\r\nof it. This black dust consists of the spores of a tiny fungous plant.\r\nThe fungous smut plant grows upon the oat plant, ripens its spores in\r\nthe head, and is ready to be thoroughly scattered among the grains of\r\nthe oats as they come from the threshing-machine.\r\n\r\nThese spores cling to the grain and at the next planting are ready to\r\nattack the sprouting plantlet. A curious thing about the smut is that it\r\ncan gain a foothold only on very young oat plants; that is, on plants\r\nabout an inch long or of the age shown in Fig. 121.\r\n\r\nWhen grain covered with smut spores is planted, the spores develop with\r\nthe sprouting seeds and are ready to attack the young plant as it breaks\r\nthrough the seed-coat. You see, then, how important it is to have seed\r\ngrain free from smut. A substance has been found that will, without\r\ninjuring the seeds, kill all the smut spores clinging to the grain. This\r\nsubstance is called _formalin_. Enough seed to plant a whole acre can be\r\ntreated with formalin at a cost of only a few cents. Such treatment\r\ninsures a full crop and clean seed for future planting. Try it if you\r\nhave any smut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122. A CROP FROM OATS TREATED WITH FORMALIN]\r\n\r\nFig. 122 illustrates what may be gained by using seeds treated to\r\nprevent smut. The annual loss to the farmers of the United States from\r\nsmut on oats amounts to several millions of dollars. All that is needed\r\nto prevent this loss is a little care in the treatment of seed and a\r\nproper rotation of crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Count the smutted heads on a patch three feet square and estimate\r\n     the percentage of smut in all the wheat and oat fields near your\r\n     home. On which is it most abundant? Do you know of any fields that\r\n     have been treated for smut? If so, look for smut in these fields.\r\n     Ask how they were treated. Do you know of any one who uses\r\n     bluestone for wheat smut? Can oats be treated with bluestone?\r\n\r\n     At planting time get an ounce of formalin at your drug store or\r\n     from the state experiment station. Mix this with three gallons of\r\n     water. This amount will treat three bushels of seeds. Spread the\r\n     seeds thinly on the barn floor and sprinkle them with the mixture,\r\n     being careful that all the seeds are thoroughly moistened. Cover\r\n     closely with blankets for a few hours and plant very soon after\r\n     treatment. Try this and estimate the per cent of smut at next\r\n     harvest-time. Write to your experiment station for a bulletin on\r\n     smut treatment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123. A SCABBY SEED POTATO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124. A HEALTHY SEED POTATO]\r\n\r\n=Potato Scab.= The scab of the white, or Irish, potato is one of the\r\ncommonest and at the same time most easily prevented of plant diseases.\r\nYet this disease diminishes the profits of the potato-grower very\r\nmaterially. Fig. 123 shows a very scabby potato, while Fig. 124\r\nrepresents a healthy one. This scab is caused by a fungous growth on the\r\nsurface of the potato. Of course it lessens the selling-price of the\r\npotatoes. If seed potatoes be treated to a bath of formalin just before\r\nthey are planted, the formalin will kill the fungi on the potatoes and\r\ngreatly diminish the amount of scab at the next harvest. Therefore\r\nbefore they are planted, seed potatoes should be soaked in a weak\r\nsolution of formalin for about two hours. One-half pint of formalin to\r\nfifteen gallons of water makes a proper solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125\r\nFrom a scabby potato, like the one in Fig. 123, this yield was obtained]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126\r\nFrom a healthy potato, like the one in Fig. 124, this yield was obtained]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127. EFFECT OF SPRAYING\r\nSprayed potatoes on left; unsprayed on right]\r\n\r\nOne pint of formalin, or enough for thirty gallons of water, will cost\r\nbut thirty-five cents. Since this solution can be used repeatedly, it\r\nwill do for many bushels of seed potatoes.\r\n\r\n=Late Potato Blight.= The blight is another serious disease of the\r\npotato. This is quite a different disease from the scab and so requires\r\ndifferent treatment. The blight is caused by another fungus, which\r\nattacks the foliage of the potato plant. When the blight seriously\r\nattacks a crop, it generally destroys the crop completely. In the year\r\n1845 a potato famine extending over all the United States and Europe was\r\ncaused by this disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128. YIELD FROM TWO FIELDS OF THE SAME SIZE\r\nThe one at the top was sprayed; the one at the bottom was unsprayed]\r\n\r\nSpraying is the remedy for potato blight. Fig. 128 shows the effect of\r\nspraying upon the yield. In this case the sprayed field yielded three\r\nhundred and twenty-four bushels an acre, while the unsprayed yielded\r\nonly one hundred bushels to an acre. Fig. 127 shows the result of three\r\napplications of the spraying mixture on the diseased field. Figs. 129\r\nand 130 show how the spraying is done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129. SPRAYING MACHINE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130. SPRAYING MACHINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Watch the potatoes at the next harvest and estimate the number that\r\n     is damaged by scab. You will remember that formalin is the\r\n     substance used to prevent grain smuts. Write to your state\r\n     experiment station for a bulletin telling how to use formalin, as\r\n     well as for information regarding other potato diseases. Give the\r\n     treatment a fair trial in a portion of your field this year and\r\n     watch carefully for results. Make an estimate of the cost of\r\n     treatment and of the profits. How does the scab injure the value of\r\n     the potato? The late blight can often be recognized by its odor.\r\n     Did you ever smell it as you passed an affected field?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131. CLUB ROOT]\r\n\r\n=Club Root.= Club root is a disease of the cabbage, turnip, cauliflower,\r\netc. Its general effect is shown in the illustration (Fig. 131).\r\nSometimes this disease does great damage. It can be prevented by using\r\nfrom eighty to ninety bushels of lime to an acre.\r\n\r\n=Black Knot.= Black knot is a serious disease of the plum and of the\r\ncherry tree. It attacks the branches of the tree; it is well\r\nillustrated in Fig. 132. Since it is a contagious disease, great care\r\nshould be exercised to destroy all diseased branches of either wild or\r\ncultivated plums or cherries. In many states its destruction is enforced\r\nby law. All black knot should be cut out and burned some time before\r\nFebruary of each year. This will cost little and save much.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132. BLACK KNOT]\r\n\r\n=Peach Leaf Curl.= Peach leaf curl does damage amounting to about\r\n$3,000,000 yearly in the United States. It can be almost entirely\r\nprevented by spraying the tree with Bordeaux mixture or lime-sulphur\r\nwash before the buds open in the spring. It is not safe to use strong\r\nBordeaux mixture on peach trees when they are in leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133. MOLDY PEACHES]\r\n\r\n=Cotton Wilt.= Cotton wilt when it once establishes itself in the soil\r\ncompletely destroys the crop. The fungus remains in the soil, and no\r\namount of spraying will kill it. The only known remedy is to cultivate a\r\nresistant variety of cotton or to rotate the crop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134. PEACH MUMMIES]\r\n\r\n=Fruit Mold.= Fruit mold, or brown rot, often attacks the unripe fruit\r\non the tree, and turns it soft and brown and finally fuzzy with a coat\r\nof mildew. Fig. 133 shows some peaches thus attacked. Often the fruits\r\ndo not fall from the trees but shrivel up and become \"mummies\" (Fig.\r\n134). This rot is one of the most serious diseases of plums and peaches.\r\nIt probably diminishes the value of the peach harvest from 50 to 75 per\r\ncent. Spraying according to the directions in the Appendix will kill the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135. HALF OF TREE SPRAYED TO PREVENT PEACH CURL\r\nNote the difference in foliage and fruit on the sprayed and unsprayed\r\nhalves of the tree, and the difference in yield shown below]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nORCHARD, GARDEN, AND FIELD INSECTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXI. INSECTS IN GENERAL\r\n\r\nThe farmer who has fought \"bugs\" on crop after crop needs no argument to\r\nconvince him that insects are serious enemies to agriculture. Yet even\r\nhe may be surprised to learn that the damage done by them, as estimated\r\nby good authority, amounts to millions and millions of dollars yearly in\r\nthe United States and Canada.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136. ANTS]\r\n\r\nEvery one thinks he knows what an insect is. If, however, we are willing\r\nin this matter to make our notion agree with that of the people who have\r\nstudied insects most and know them best, we must include among the true\r\ninsects only such air-breathing animals as have six legs, no more, and\r\nhave the body divided into three parts--head, thorax, and abdomen. These\r\nparts are clearly shown in Fig. 136, which represents the ant, a true\r\ninsect. All insects do not show the divisions of the body so clearly as\r\nthis figure shows them, but on careful examination you can usually make\r\nthem out. The head bears one pair of feelers, and these in many insects\r\nserve also as organs of smell and sometimes of hearing. Less prominent\r\nfeelers are to be found in the region of the mouth. These serve as\r\norgans of taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137. PARTS OF AN INSECT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138. COMPOUND EYE OF DRAGON FLY]\r\n\r\nThe eyes of insects are especially noticeable. Close examination shows\r\nthem to be made up of a thousand or more simple eyes. Such an eye is\r\ncalled a _compound eye_. An enlarged view of one of these is shown in\r\nFig. 138.\r\n\r\nAttached to the thorax are the legs and also the wings, if the insect\r\nhas wings. The rear portion is the abdomen, and this, like the other\r\nparts, is composed of parts known as segments. The insect breathes\r\nthrough openings in the abdomen and thorax called _spiracles_ (see Fig.\r\n137).\r\n\r\nAn examination of spiders, mites, and ticks shows eight legs; therefore\r\nthese do not belong to the true insects, nor do the thousand-legged\r\nworms and their relatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139. THE HOUSE FLY\r\n_a_, egg; _b_, larva, or maggot; _c_, pupa; _d_, adult male. (All\r\nenlarged)]\r\n\r\nThe chief classes of insects are as follows: the flies, with two wings\r\nonly; the bees, wasps, and ants, with four delicate wings; the beetles,\r\nwith four wings--two hard, horny ones covering the two more delicate\r\nones. When the beetle is at rest its two hard wings meet in a straight\r\nline down the back. This peculiarity distinguishes it from the true bug,\r\nwhich has four wings. The two outer wings are partly horny, and in\r\nfolding lap over each other. Butterflies and moths are much alike in\r\nappearance but differ in habit. The butterfly works by day and the moth\r\nby night. Note the knob on the end of the butterfly's feeler (Fig. 143).\r\nThe moth has no such knob.\r\n\r\nIt is important to know how insects take their food, for by knowing this\r\nwe are often able to destroy insect pests. Some are provided with mouth\r\nparts for chewing their food; others have a long tube with which they\r\npierce plants or animals and, like the mosquito, suck their food from\r\nthe inside. Insects of this latter class cannot of course be harmed by\r\npoison on the surface of the leaves on which they feed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140. A TYPICAL BUG\r\n_a_, adult; _b_, side view of sucking mouth-part Both _a_ and _b_ are\r\nmuch enlarged]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141. BEETLE\r\n_a_, larva; _b_, pupa; _c_, adult; _d_, burrow]\r\n\r\nMany insects change their form from youth to old age so much that you\r\ncan scarcely recognize them as the same creatures. First comes the egg.\r\nThe egg hatches into a worm-like animal known as a grub, maggot, or\r\ncaterpillar, or, as scientists call it, a _larva_. This creature feeds\r\nand grows until finally it settles down and spins a home of silk, called\r\na _cocoon_ (Fig. 145). If we open the cocoon we shall find that the\r\nanimal is now covered with a hard outside skeleton, that it cannot move\r\nfreely, and that it cannot eat at all. The animal in this state is known\r\nas the _pupa_ (Figs. 145 and 146). Sometimes, however, the pupa is not\r\ncovered by a cocoon, sometimes it is soft, and sometimes it has some\r\npower of motion (Fig. 141). After a rest in the pupa stage the animal\r\ncomes out a mature insect (Figs. 142 and 143).\r\n\r\nFrom this you can see that it is especially important to know all you\r\ncan about the life of injurious insects, since it is often easier to\r\nkill these pests at one stage of their life than at another. Often it is\r\nbetter to aim at destroying the seemingly harmless beetle or butterfly\r\nthan to try to destroy the larvae that hatch from its eggs, although, as\r\nyou must remember, it is generally the larvae that do the most harm.\r\nLarvae grow very rapidly; therefore the food supply must be great to meet\r\nthe needs of the insect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142. MOTH AND COCOON]\r\n\r\nSome insects, the grasshopper for example, do not completely change\r\ntheir form. Fig. 147 represents some young grasshoppers, which very\r\nclosely resemble their parents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143. BUTTERFLY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144. STRUCTURE OF THE CATERPILLAR]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145. MOTH PUPA IN COCOON]\r\n\r\nInsects lay many eggs and reproduce with remarkable rapidity. Their\r\nnumber therefore makes them a foe to be much dreaded. The queen honeybee\r\noften lays as many as 4000 eggs in twenty-four hours. A single house fly\r\nlays between 100 and 150 eggs in one day. The mosquito lays eggs in\r\nquantities of from 200 to 400. The white ant often lays 80,000 in a day,\r\nand so continues for two years, probably laying no less than 40,000,000\r\neggs. In one summer the bluebottle fly could have 500,000,000\r\ndescendants if they all lived. The plant louse, at the end of the fifth\r\nbrood, has laid in a single year enough eggs to produce 300,000,000\r\nyoung. Of course every one knows that, owing to enemies and diseases\r\n(for the insects have enemies which prey on them just as they prey on\r\nplants) comparatively few of the insects hatched from these eggs live\r\ntill they are grown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146. A BUTTERFLY PUPA\r\nNote outline of the butterfly]\r\n\r\nThe number of insects which are hurtful to crops, gardens, flowers, and\r\nforests seems to be increasing each season. Therefore farm boys and\r\ngirls should learn to recognize these harmful insects and to know how\r\nthey live and how they may be destroyed. Those who know the forms and\r\nhabits of these enemies of plants and trees are far better prepared to\r\nfight them than are those who strike in the dark. Moreover such\r\nknowledge is always a source of interest and pleasure. If you begin to\r\nstudy insects, you will soon find your love for the study growing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147. THE GROWTH OF A GRASSHOPPER]\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Collect cocoons and pupae of insects and hatch them in a\r\n     breeding-cage similar to the one illustrated in Fig. 149. Make\r\n     several cages of this kind. Collect larvae of several kinds; supply\r\n     them with food from plants upon which you found them. Find out the\r\n     time it takes them to change into another stage. Write a\r\n     description of this process.\r\n\r\n     The plant louse could produce in its twelfth brood\r\n     10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 offspring. Each louse is about one\r\n     tenth of an inch long. If all should live and be arranged in single\r\n     file, how many miles long would such a procession be?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148. PLANT LICE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149. CAGE IN WHICH TO BREED INSECTS\r\nFlower-pot, lamp-chimney, and cloth]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXII. ORCHARD INSECTS\r\n\r\n=The San Jose Scale.= The San Jose scale is one of the most dreaded\r\nenemies of fruit trees. It is in fact an outlaw in many states. It is an\r\nunlawful act to sell fruit trees affected by it. Fig. 150 shows a view\r\nof a branch nearly covered with this pest. Although this scale is a very\r\nminute animal, yet so rapidly does it multiply that it is very\r\ndangerous to the tree. Never allow new trees to be brought into your\r\norchard until you feel certain that they are free from the San Jose\r\nscale. If, however, it should in any way gain access to your orchard,\r\nyou can prevent its spreading by thorough spraying with what is known as\r\nthe lime-sulphur mixture. This mixture has long been used on the Pacific\r\ncoast as a remedy for various scale insects. When it was first tried in\r\nother parts of the United States the results were not satisfactory and\r\nits use was abandoned. However, later experiments with it have proved\r\nthat the mixture is thoroughly effective in killing this scale and that\r\nit is perfectly harmless to the trees. Until the lime-sulphur mixture\r\nproved to be successful the San Jose scale was a most dreaded nursery\r\nand orchard foe. It was even thought necessary to destroy infected\r\ntrees. The lime-sulphur mixture and some other sulphur washes not only\r\nkill the San Jose scale but are also useful in reducing fungous injury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150 SAN JOSE SCALE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151. SINGLE SAN JOSE SCALE\r\nMagnified]\r\n\r\nThere are several ways of making the lime-sulphur mixture. It is\r\ngenerally best to buy a prepared mixture from some trustworthy dealer.\r\nIf you find the scale on your trees, write to your state experiment\r\nstation for directions for combating it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152. THE CODLING MOTH\r\n_a_, burrow of worm in apple; _b_, place where worm enters; _c_, place\r\nwhere worm leaves; _e_, the larva; _d_, the pupa; _i_, the cocoon; _f_\r\nand _g_, moths; _h_, magnified head of larva]\r\n\r\n=The Codling Moth.= The codling moth attacks the apple and often causes\r\na loss of from twenty-five to seventy-five per cent of the crop. In the\r\nstate of New York this insect is causing an annual loss of about three\r\nmillion dollars. The effect it has on the fruit is most clearly seen in\r\nFig. 152. The moth lays its egg upon the young leaves just after the\r\nfalling of the blossom. She flies on from apple to apple, depositing an\r\negg each time until from fifty to seventy-five eggs are deposited. The\r\nlarva, or \"worm,\" soon hatches and eats its way into the apple. Many\r\naffected apples ripen too soon and drop as \"windfalls.\" Others remain on\r\nthe tree and become the common wormy apples so familiar to growers. The\r\nlarva that emerges from the windfalls moves generally to a tree, crawls\r\nup the trunk, and spins its cocoon under a ridge in the bark. From the\r\ncocoon the moth comes ready to start a new generation. The last\r\ngeneration of the larvae spends the winter in the cocoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153. SPRAYING THE ORCHARD BRINGS LUSCIOUS FRUIT\r\nThe picture in the corner at the top shows the right time to spray for\r\ncodling moth]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Destroy orchard trash which may serve as a winter home.\r\nScrape all loose bark from the tree. Spray the tree with arsenate of\r\nlead as soon as the flowers fall. A former method of fighting this pest\r\nwas as follows: bands of burlap four inches wide tied around the tree\r\nfurnished a hiding-place for larvae that came from windfalls or crawled\r\nfrom wormy apples on the tree. The larvae caught under the bands were\r\nkilled every five or six days. We know now, however, that a thorough\r\nspraying just after the blossoms fall kills the worms and renders the\r\nbands unnecessary. Furthermore, spraying prevents wormy apples, while\r\nbanding does not. Follow the first spraying by a second two weeks later.\r\n\r\nIt is best to use lime-sulphur mixture or the Bordeaux mixture with\r\narsenate of lead for a spray. Thus one spraying serves against both\r\nfungi and insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154. PLUM CURCULIO\r\nLarva, pupa, adult, and mark on the fruit. (Enlarged)]\r\n\r\n=The Plum Curculio.= The plum curculio, sometimes called the plum\r\nweevil, is a little creature about one fifth of an inch long. In spite\r\nof its small size the curculio does, if neglected, great damage to our\r\nfruit crop. It injures peaches, plums, and cherries by stinging the\r\nfruit as soon as it is formed. The word \"stinging\" when applied to\r\ninsects--- and this case is no exception--means piercing the object\r\nwith the egg-layer (ovipositor) and depositing the egg. Some insects\r\noccasionally use the ovipositor merely for defense. The curculio has an\r\nespecially interesting method of laying her egg. First she digs a hole,\r\nin which she places the egg and pushes it well down. Then with her snout\r\nshe makes a crescent-shaped cut in the skin of the plum, around the egg.\r\nThis mark is shown in Fig. 154. As this peculiar cut is followed by a\r\nflow of gum, you will always be able to recognize the work of the\r\ncurculio. Having finished with one plum, this industrious worker makes\r\nher way to other plums until her eggs are all laid. The maggotlike larva\r\nsoon hatches, burrows through the fruit, and causes it to drop before\r\nripening. The larva then enters the ground to a depth of several inches.\r\nThere it becomes a pupa, and later, as a mature beetle, emerges and\r\nwinters in cracks and crevices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155. LEAF GALLS OF PHYLLOXERA ON CLINTON GRAPE LEAF]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Burn orchard trash which may serve as winter quarters.\r\nSpraying with arsenate of lead, using two pounds of the mixture to fifty\r\ngallons of water, is the only successful treatment for the curculio. For\r\nplums and peaches, spray first when the fruit is free from the calyx\r\ncaps, or dried flower-buds. Repeat the spraying two weeks later. For\r\nlate peaches spray a third time two weeks after the second spraying.\r\nThis poisonous spray will kill the beetles while they are feeding or\r\ncutting holes in which to lay their eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156. THE CANKERWORM]\r\n\r\nFowls in the orchard do good by capturing the larvae before they can\r\nburrow, while hogs will destroy the fallen fruit before the larvae can\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n=The Grape Phylloxera.= The grape phylloxera is a serious pest. You have\r\nno doubt seen its galls upon the grape leaf. These galls are caused by a\r\nsmall louse, the phylloxera. Each gall contains a female, which soon\r\nfills the gall with eggs. These hatch into more females, which emerge\r\nand form new galls, and so the phylloxera spreads (see Fig. 155).\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ The Clinton grape is most liable to injury from this pest.\r\nHence it is better to grow other more resistant kinds. Sometimes the\r\nlice attack the roots of the grape vines. In many sections where\r\nirrigation is practiced the grape rows are flooded when the lice are\r\nthickest. The water drowns the lice and does no harm to the vines.\r\n\r\n=The Cankerworm.= The cankerworm is the larva of a moth. Because of its\r\npeculiar mode of crawling, by looping its body, it is often called the\r\nlooping worm or measuring worm (Fig. 157, _c_). These worms are such\r\ngreedy eaters that in a short time they can so cut the leaves of an\r\norchard as to give it a scorched appearance. Such an attack practically\r\ndestroys the crop and does lasting injury to the tree. The worms are\r\ngreen or brown and are striped lengthwise. If the tree is jarred, the\r\nworm has a peculiar habit of dropping toward the ground on a silken\r\nthread of its own making (Fig. 156).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157. THE SPRING CANKERWORM\r\n_a_, egg mass; _b_, egg, magnified; _c_, larva; _d_, female moth; _e_,\r\nmale moth]\r\n\r\nIn early summer the larvae burrow within the earth and pupate there;\r\nlater they emerge as adults (Fig. 157, _d_ and _e_). You observe the\r\npeculiar difference between the wingless female, _d_, and the winged\r\nmale, _e_. It is the habit of this wingless female to crawl up the trunk\r\nof some near-by tree in order to deposit her eggs upon the twigs. These\r\neggs (shown at _a_ and _b_) hatch into the greedy larvae that do so much\r\ndamage to our orchards.\r\n\r\nNearly all the common birds feed freely upon the cankerworm, and benefit\r\nthe orchard in so doing. The chickadee is perhaps the most useful. A\r\nrecent writer is very positive that each chickadee will devour on an\r\naverage thirty female cankerworm moths a day; and that if the average\r\nnumber of eggs laid by each female is one hundred and eighty-five, one\r\nchickadee would thus destroy in one day five thousand five hundred and\r\nfifty eggs, and, in the twenty-five days in which the cankerworm moths\r\ncrawl up the tree, would rid the orchard of one hundred and thirty-eight\r\nthousand seven hundred and fifty. These birds also eat immense numbers\r\nof cankerworm eggs before they hatch into worms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158. EGGS OF THE FALL CANKERWORM]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ The inability of the female to fly gives us an easy way to\r\nprevent the larval offspring from getting to the foliage of our trees,\r\nfor we know that the only highway open to her or her larvae leads up the\r\ntrunk. We must obstruct this highway so that no crawling creature may\r\npass. This is readily done by smoothing the bark and fitting close to it\r\na band of paper, and making sure that it is tight enough to prevent\r\nanything from crawling underneath. Then smear over the paper something\r\nso sticky that any moth or larva that attempts to pass will be\r\nentangled. Printer's ink will do very well, or you can buy either\r\ndendrolene or tanglefoot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159. APPLE-TREE TENT CATERPILLAR\r\n_a_, eggs; _b_, cocoon; _c_, caterpillar]\r\n\r\nEncourage the chickadee and all other birds, except the English sparrow,\r\nto stay in your orchard. This is easily done by feeding and protecting\r\nthem in their times of need.\r\n\r\n=The Apple-Tree Tent Caterpillar.= The apple-tree tent caterpillar is a\r\nlarva so well known that you only need to be told how to guard against\r\nit. The mother of this caterpillar is a reddish moth. This insect passes\r\nthe winter in the egg state securely fastened on the twigs as shown in\r\nFig. 159, _a_.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ There are three principal methods, (1) Destroy the eggs.\r\nThe egg masses are readily seen in winter and may easily be collected\r\nand burned by boys. The chickadee eats great quantities of these eggs.\r\n(2) With torches burn the nests at dusk when all the worms are within.\r\nYou must be very careful in burning or you will harm the young branches\r\nwith their tender bark. (3) Encourage the residence of birds. Urge your\r\nneighbors to make war on the larvae, too, since the pest spreads rapidly\r\nfrom farm to farm. Regularly sprayed orchards are rarely troubled by\r\nthis pest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160. THE TWIG GIRDLER AT ITS DESTRUCTIVE WORK\r\n_a_, the girdler; _b_, the egg-hole; _c_, the groove cut by girdler;\r\n_e_, the egg]\r\n\r\n=The Twig Girdler.= The twig girdler lays her eggs in the twigs of pear,\r\npecan, apple, and other trees. It is necessary that the larvae develop in\r\ndead wood. This the mother provides by girdling the twig so deeply that\r\nit will die and fall to the ground.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Since the larvae spend the winter in the dead twigs, burn\r\nthese twigs in autumn or early spring and thus destroy the pest.\r\n\r\n=The Peach-Tree Borer.= In Fig. 161 you see the effect of the peach-tree\r\nborer's activity. These borers often girdle and thereby kill a tree.\r\nFig. 162 shows the adult state of the insect. The eggs are laid on peach\r\nor plum trees near the ground. As soon as the larva emerges, it bores\r\ninto the bark and remains there for months, passing through the pupa\r\nstage before it comes out to lay eggs for another generation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161. BORER SIGNS AROUND BASE OF PEACH TREE]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ If there are only a few trees in the orchard, digging the\r\nworms out with a knife is the best way of destroying them. You can know\r\nof the borer's presence by the exuding gum often seen on the tree-trunk.\r\nIf you pile earth around the roots early in the spring and remove it in\r\nthe late fall, the winter freezing and thawing will kill many of the\r\nlarvae.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     How many apples per hundred do you find injured by the codling\r\n     moth? Collect some cocoons from a pear or an apple tree in winter,\r\n     place in a breeding-cage, and watch for the moths that come out. Do\r\n     you ever see the woodpecker hunting for these same cocoons? Can you\r\n     find cocoons that have been emptied by this bird? Estimate how many\r\n     he considers a day's ration. How many apples does he thus save?\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 162. PEACH-TREE BORERS, MALE AND FEMALE\r\n     Female with broad yellow band across abdomen]\r\n\r\n     Watch the curculio lay her eggs in the plums, peaches, or cherries.\r\n     What per cent of fruit is thus injured? Estimate the damage. Let\r\n     the school offer a prize for the greatest number of\r\n     tent-caterpillar eggs. Watch such trees as the apple, the wild and\r\n     the cultivated cherry, the oak, and many others.\r\n\r\n     Make a collection of insects injurious to orchard fruits, showing\r\n     in each case the whole life history of the insect, that is, eggs,\r\n     larva, pupa, and the mature insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TROUBLESOME CHINCH BUG (ENLARGED)\r\n1, bugs on plant; 2, eggs; 3, young bug; 4 and 5, older bugs; 6,\r\nlong-winged bug; 7 and 8, short-winged bug]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII. GARDEN AND FIELD INSECTS\r\n\r\n=The Cabbage Worm.= The cabbage worm of the early spring garden is a\r\nfamiliar object, but you may not know that the innocent-looking little\r\nwhite butterflies hovering about the cabbage patch are laying eggs which\r\nare soon to hatch and make the dreaded cabbage worms. In Fig. 164 _a_\r\nand _b_ show the common cabbage butterfly, _c_ shows several examples of\r\nthe caterpillar, and _d_ shows the pupa case. In the pupa stage the\r\ninsects pass the winter among the remains of old plants or in near-by\r\nfences or in weeds or bushes. Cleaning up and burning all trash will\r\ndestroy many pupae and thus prevent many cabbage worms. In Fig. 164 _e_\r\nand _f_ show the moth and zebra caterpillar; _g_ represents a moth which\r\nis the parent of the small green worm shown at _h_. This worm is a\r\ncommon foe of the cabbage plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163. THE DREADED CHINCH BUG]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Birds aid in the destruction of this pest. Paris green\r\nmixed with air-slaked lime will also kill many larvae. After the cabbage\r\nhas headed, it is very difficult to destroy the worm, but pyrethrum\r\ninsect powder used freely is helpful.\r\n\r\n=The Chinch Bug.= The chinch bug, attacking as it does such important\r\ncrops as wheat, corn, and grasses, is a well-known pest. It probably\r\ncauses more money loss than any other garden or field enemy. In Orange\r\ncounty, North Carolina, farmers were once obliged to suspend\r\nwheat-growing for two years on account of the chinch bug. In one year in\r\nthe state of Illinois this bug caused a loss of four million dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164. CABBAGE WORMS AND BUTTERFLIES]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Unfortunately we cannot prevent all of the damage done by\r\nchinch bugs, but we can diminish it somewhat by good clean agriculture.\r\nDestroy the winter homes of the insect by burning dry grass, leaves, and\r\nrubbish in fields and fence rows. Although the insect has wings, it\r\nseldom or never uses them, usually traveling on foot; therefore a deep\r\nfurrow around the field to be protected will hinder or stop the progress\r\nof an invasion. The bugs fall into the bottom of the furrow, and may\r\nthere be killed by dragging a log up and down the furrow. Write to the\r\nDivision of Entomology, Washington, for bulletins on the chinch bug.\r\nOther methods of prevention are to be found in these bulletins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165. A PLANT LOUSE COLONY]\r\n\r\n=The Plant Louse.= The plant louse is very small, but it multiplies with\r\nvery great rapidity. During the summer the young are born alive, and it\r\nis only toward fall that eggs are laid. The individuals that hatch from\r\neggs are generally wingless females, and their young, born alive, are\r\nboth winged and wingless. The winged forms fly to other plants and start\r\nnew colonies. Plant lice mature in from eight to fourteen days.\r\n\r\nThe plant louse gives off a sweetish fluid of which some ants are very\r\nfond. You may often see the ants stroking these lice to induce them to\r\ngive off a freer flow of the \"honey dew.\" This is really a method of\r\nmilking. However friendly and useful these \"cows\" may be to the ant,\r\nthey are enemies to man in destroying so many of his plants.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ These are sucking insects. Poisons therefore do not avail.\r\nThey may be killed by spraying with kerosene emulsion or a strong soap\r\nsolution or with tobacco water. Lice on cabbages are easily killed by a\r\nmixture of one pound of lye soap in four gallons of warm water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166. A CHEAP SPRAYING OUTFIT]\r\n\r\n=The Squash Bug.= The squash bug does its greatest damage to young\r\nplants. To such its attack is often fatal. On larger plants single\r\nleaves may die. This insect is a serious enemy to a crop and is\r\nparticularly difficult to get rid of, since it belongs to the class of\r\nsucking insects, not to the biting insects. For this reason poisons are\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167. A SQUASH BUG]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ About the only practicable remedy is to pick these insects\r\nby hand. We can, however, protect our young plants by small nettings and\r\nthus tide them over the most dangerous period of their lives. These bugs\r\ngreatly prefer the squash as food. You can therefore diminish their\r\nattack on your melons, cucumbers, etc. by planting among the melons an\r\noccasional squash plant as a \"trap plant.\" Hand picking will be easier\r\non a few trap plants than over the whole field. A small board or large\r\nleaf laid beside the young plant often furnishes night shelter for the\r\nbugs. The bugs collected under the board may easily be killed every\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n=The Flea-Beetle.= The flea-beetle inflicts much damage on the potato,\r\ntomato, eggplant, and other garden plants. The accompanying figure shows\r\nthe common striped flea-beetle which lives on the tomato. The larva of\r\nthis beetle lives inside of the leaves, mining its way through the leaf\r\nin a real tunnel. Any substance disagreeable to the beetle, such as\r\nplaster, soot, ashes, or tobacco, will repel its attacks on the garden\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168. FLEA-BEETLE AND LARVA\r\n_a_, larva; _b_, adult. Lines on sides show real length of insects]\r\n\r\n=The Weevil.= The weevil is commonly found among seeds. Its attacks are\r\nserious, but the insect may easily be destroyed.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Put the infected seeds in an air-tight box or bin, placing\r\non the top of the pile a dish containing carbon disulphide, a\r\ntablespoonful to a bushel of seeds. The fumes of this substance are\r\nheavy and will pass through the mass of seeds below and kill all the\r\nweevils and other animals there. The bin should be closely covered with\r\ncanvas or heavy cloth to prevent the fumes from being carried away by\r\nthe air. Let the seeds remain thus from two to five days. Repeat the\r\ntreatment if any weevils are found alive. Fumigate when the temperature\r\nis 70 deg. Fahrenheit or above. In cold weather or in a loose bin the\r\ntreatment is not successful. _Caution:_ Do not approach the bin with a\r\nlight, since the fumes of the chemical used are highly inflammable.\r\n\r\n=The Hessian Fly.= The Hessian fly does more damage to the wheat crop\r\nthan all other insects combined, and probably ranks next to the chinch\r\nbug as the second worst insect enemy of the farmer. It was probably\r\nintroduced into this country by the Hessian troops in the War of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169. THE HESSIAN FLY]\r\n\r\nIn autumn the insect lays its eggs in the leaves of the wheat. These\r\nhatch into the larvae, which move down into the crown of the plant, where\r\nthey pass the winter. There they cause on the plant a slight gall\r\nformation, which injures or kills the plant. In the spring adult flies\r\nemerge and lay eggs. The larvae that hatch feed in the lower joints of\r\nthe growing wheat and prevent its proper growth. These larvae pupate and\r\nremain as pupae in the wheat stubble during the summer. The fall brood of\r\nflies appears shortly before the first heavy frost.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Burn all stubble and trash during July and August. If the\r\nfly is very bad, it is well to leave the stubble unusually high to\r\ninsure a rapid spread of the fire. Burn refuse from the\r\nthreshing-machine, since this often harbors many larvae or pupae. Follow\r\nthe burning by deep plowing, because the burning cannot reach the\r\ninsects that are in the base of the plants. Delay the fall planting\r\nuntil time for heavy frosts.\r\n\r\n=The Potato Beetle; Tobacco Worm.= The potato beetle, tobacco worm,\r\netc., are too well known to need description. Suffice it to say that no\r\ngood farmer will neglect to protect his crop from any pest that\r\nthreatens it.\r\n\r\nThe increase, owing to various causes, of insects, of fungi, of\r\nbacterial diseases, makes a study of these pests, of their origin, and\r\nof their prevention a necessary part of a successful farmer's training.\r\nTillage alone will no longer render orchard, vineyard, and garden\r\nfruitful. Protection from every form of plant enemies must be added to\r\ntillage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170. SPRAYING THE ORCHARD\r\nOne way of increasing the yield of fruit]\r\n\r\nIn dealing with plants, as with human beings, the great object should be\r\nnot the cure but the prevention of disease. If disease can be prevented,\r\nit is far too costly to wait for it to develop and then to attempt its\r\ncure. Men of science are studying the new forms of diseases and new\r\ninsects as fast as they appear. These men are finding ways of fighting\r\nold and new enemies. Young people who expect to farm should early learn\r\nto follow their advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     How does the squash bug resemble the plant louse? Is this a true\r\n     bug? Gather some eggs and watch the development of the insects in a\r\n     breeding-cage. Estimate the damage done to some crops by the\r\n     flea-beetle. What is the best method of prevention?\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 171. AN APPLE TREE SHOWING PROPER CARE]\r\n\r\n     Do you know the large moth that is the mother of the tobacco worm?\r\n     You may often see her visiting the blossoms of the Jimson weed.\r\n     Some tobacco-growers cultivate a few of these weeds in a tobacco\r\n     field. In the blossom they place a little cobalt or \"fly-stone\" and\r\n     sirup. When the tobacco-worm moth visits this flower and sips the\r\n     poisoned nectar, she will of course lay no more troublesome eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIV. THE COTTON-BOLL WEEVIL\r\n\r\nSo far as known, the cotton-boll weevil, an insect which is a native of\r\nthe tropics, crossed the Rio Grande River into Texas in 1891 and 1892.\r\nIt settled in the cotton fields around Brownsville. Since then it has\r\nwidened its destructive area until now it has invaded the whole\r\nterritory shown by the map on page 177.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172. ADULT COTTON-BOLL WEEVIL\r\nEnlarged]\r\n\r\nThis weevil is a small gray or reddish-brown snout-beetle hardly over a\r\nquarter of an inch in length. In proportion to its length it has a long\r\nbeak. It belongs to a family of beetles which breed in pods, in seeds,\r\nand in stalks of plants. It is a greedy eater, but feeds only on the\r\ncotton plant.\r\n\r\nThe grown weevils try to outlive the cold of winter by hiding snugly\r\naway under grass clumps, cotton-stalks, rubbish, or under the bark of\r\ntrees. Sometimes they go down into holes in the ground. A comfortable\r\nshelter is often found in the forests near the cotton fields, especially\r\nin the moss on the trees. The weevils can stand a good deal of cold, but\r\nfortunately many are killed by winter weather. Moreover birds destroy\r\nmany; hence by spring the last year's crop is very greatly diminished.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, generally about the time cotton begins to form \"squares,\"\r\nthe weevils shake off their long winter sleep and enter the cotton\r\nfields with appetites as sharp as razors. Then shortly the females begin\r\nto lay eggs. At first these eggs are laid only in the squares, and\r\ngenerally only one to the square. The young grub hatches from these eggs\r\nin two or three days. The newly hatched grub eats the inside of the\r\nsquare, and the square soon falls to the ground. Entire fields may at\r\ntimes be seen without a single square on the plants. Of course no fruit\r\ncan be formed without squares.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 173. EGGS AMONG THE ANTHERS OF A SQUARE AT THE\r\nPOINT INDICATED BY THE ARROW]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 174. CROSS SECTION SHOWING ANTHERS OF A SQUARE\r\nWITH EGG OF WEEVIL, AND SHOWING THE HOLE WHERE THE EGG WAS DEPOSITED\r\nGreatly enlarged]\r\n\r\nIn from one to two weeks the grub or larva becomes fully grown and,\r\nwithout changing its home, is transformed into the pupa state. Then in\r\nabout a week more the pupae come out as adult weevils and attack the\r\nbolls. They puncture them with their snouts and lay their eggs in the\r\nbolls. The young grubs, this time hatching out in the boll, remain there\r\nuntil grown, when they emerge through holes that they make. These holes\r\nallow dampness to enter and destroy the bolls. This life-round continues\r\nuntil cold weather drives the insects to their winter quarters. By that\r\ntime they have increased so rapidly that there is often one for every\r\nboll in the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 175. THE LARVA OF THE COTTON-BOLL WEEVIL\r\nINJURING A SQUARE]\r\n\r\nThis weevil is proving very hard to destroy. At present there seem but\r\nfew ways to fight it. One is to grow cotton that will mature too early\r\nfor the weevils to do it much harm. A second is to kill as many weevils\r\nas possible by burning the homes that shelter them in winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 176. PUPA OF COTTON-BOLL WEEVIL FROM ABOVE AND BELOW\r\nGreatly enlarged]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 177. THE PUPA OF THE COTTON-BOLL WEEVIL IN A SQUARE]\r\n\r\nThe places best adapted for a winter home for the weevil are trash\r\npiles, rubbish, driftwood, rotten wood, weeds, moss on trees, etc. A\r\nfurther help, therefore, in destroying the weevil is to cut down and\r\nburn all cotton-stalks as soon as the cotton is harvested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 178. A COTTON BOLL WITH FEEDING-HOLES OF WEEVIL,\r\nAND BEARING THREE SPECIMENS OF THE INSECT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 179. THE MEXICAN COTTON-BOLL WEEVIL,\r\nSHOWING STRUCTURE]\r\n\r\nThis destroys countless numbers of larvae and pupae in the bolls and\r\ngreatly reduces the number of weevils. In addition, all cornstalks, all\r\ntrash, all large clumps of grass in neighboring fields, should be\r\nburned, so as to destroy these winter homes of the weevil. Also avoid\r\nplanting cotton near trees. The bark, moss, and fallen leaves of the\r\ntree furnish a winter shelter for the weevils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 180. A SERIES OF FULL GROWN WEEVILS, SHOWING\r\nVARIATIONS IN SIZE]\r\n\r\nA third help in destroying the weevil is to rotate crops. If cotton does\r\nnot follow cotton, the weevil has nothing on which to feed the second\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 181. MAP SHOWING DISTRIBUTION OF THE COTTON-BOLL\r\nWEEVIL IN 1913]\r\n\r\nIn adopting the first method mentioned the cotton growers have found\r\nthat by the careful selection of seed, by early planting, by a free use\r\nof fertilizers containing phosphoric acid, and by frequent plowing, they\r\ncan mature a crop about thirty days earlier than they usually do. In\r\nthis way a good crop can be harvested before the weevils are ready to be\r\nmost destructive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFARM CROPS\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery crop of the farm has been changed and improved in many ways since\r\nits forefathers were wild plants. Those plants that best serve the needs\r\nof the farmer and of farm animals have undergone the most changes and\r\nhave received also the greatest care and attention in their production\r\nand improvement.\r\n\r\nWhile we have many different kinds of farm crops, the cultivated soil of\r\nthe world is occupied by a very few. In our country the crop that is\r\nmost valuable and that occupies the greatest land area is generally\r\nknown as the _grass crop_. Included in the general term \"grass crop\" are\r\nthe grasses and clovers that are used for pasturage as well as for hay.\r\nNext to grass in value come the great cereal, corn, and the most\r\nimportant fiber crop, cotton, closely followed by the great bread crop,\r\nwheat. Oats rank fifth in value, potatoes sixth, and tobacco seventh.\r\n(These figures are for 1913.)\r\n\r\nSuccess in growing any crop is largely due to the suitableness of soil\r\nand climate to that crop. When the planter selects both the most\r\nsuitable soil and the most suitable climate for each crop, he gets not\r\nonly the most bountiful yield from the crop but, in addition, he gets\r\nthe most desirable quality of product. A little careful observation and\r\nstudy soon teach what kinds of soil produce crops of the highest\r\nexcellence. This learned, the planter is able to grow in each field the\r\nseveral crops best adapted to that special type of soil. Thus we have\r\ntobacco soils, trucking soils, wheat and corn soils. Dairying can be\r\nmost profitably followed in sections where crops like cowpeas, clover,\r\nalfalfa, and corn are peculiarly at home. No one should try to grow a\r\nnew crop in his section until he has found out whether the crop which he\r\nwants to grow is adapted to his soil and his climate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 182. ALFALFA IN THE STACK\r\nThis is the second cutting of the season]\r\n\r\nThe figures below give the average amount of money made annually an acre\r\non our chief crops:\r\n\r\nFlowers and plants, $1911; nursery products, $261; onions, $140; sugar\r\ncane, $55; small fruits, $110; hops, $175; vegetables, $78; tobacco,\r\n$80; sweet potatoes, $55; hemp, $53; potatoes, $78; sugar beets, $54;\r\nsorghum cane, $22; cotton, $22; orchard fruits, $110; peanuts, $21;\r\nflax-seed, $14; cereals, $14; hay and forage, $11; castor beans, $6\r\n(United States Census Report).\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXV. COTTON\r\n\r\nAlthough cotton was cultivated on the Eastern continent before America\r\nwas discovered, this crop owes its present kingly place in the business\r\nworld to the zeal and intelligence of its American growers. So great an\r\ninfluence does it wield in modern industrial life that it is often\r\ncalled King Cotton. Thousands upon thousands of people scan the\r\nnewspapers each day to see what price its staple is bringing. From its\r\nbounty a vast army of toilers, who plant its seed, who pick its bolls,\r\nwho gin its staple, who spin and weave its lint, who grind its seed, who\r\nrefine its oil, draw daily bread. Does not its proper production deserve\r\nthe best thought that can be given it?\r\n\r\nIn the cotton belt almost any well-drained soil will produce cotton. The\r\nfollowing kinds of soil are admirably suited to this plant: red and gray\r\nloams with good clay subsoil; sandy soils over clay and sandstone and\r\nlimestone; rich, well-drained bottom-lands. The safest soils are medium\r\nloams. Cotton land must always be well drained.\r\n\r\nCotton was originally a tropical plant, but, strange to say, it seems to\r\nthrive best in temperate zones. The cotton plant does best, according to\r\nNewman, in climates which have (1) six months of freedom from frost; (2)\r\na moderate, well-distributed rainfall during the plant's growing period;\r\nand (3) abundant sunshine and little rain during the plant's maturing\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 183. GROWTH OF COTTON FROM DAY TO DAY\r\n\r\nIn America the Southern states from Virginia to Texas have these\r\nclimatic qualities, and it is in these states that the cotton industry\r\nhas been developed until it is one of the giant industries of the world.\r\nThis development has been very rapid. As late as 1736 the cotton plant\r\nwas grown as an ornamental flowering plant in many front yards; in\r\n1911, 16,250,276 bales of cotton were grown in the South. In recent\r\nyears the soil and climate of lower California and parts of Arizona and\r\nNew Mexico have been found well adapted to cotton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 184. COTTON IN THE GROWING SEASON]\r\n\r\nThere are a great many varieties of cotton. Two types are mainly grown\r\nby the practical American farmer. These are the short-stapled, upland\r\nvariety most commonly grown in all the Southern states, and the\r\nbeautiful, long-stapled, black-seeded sea-island type that grows upon\r\nthe islands and a portion of the mainland of Georgia, South Carolina,\r\nand Florida. The air of the coast seems necessary for the production of\r\nthis latter variety. The seeds of the sea-island cotton are small,\r\nsmooth, and black. They are so smooth and stick so loosely to the lint\r\nthat they are separated from it by roller-gins instead of by saw-gins.\r\nWhen these seeds are planted away from the soil and air of their ocean\r\nhome, the plant does not thrive.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made and are still being made to increase the\r\nlength of the staple of the upland types. The methods used are as\r\nfollows: selection of seed having a long fiber; special cultivation and\r\nfertilization; crossing the short-stapled cotton on the long-stapled\r\ncotton. This last process, as already explained, is called\r\n_hybridizing_. Many of these attempts have succeeded, and there are now\r\na large number of varieties which excel the older varieties in\r\nprofitable yield. The new varieties are each year being more widely\r\ngrown. Every farmer should study the new types and select the one that\r\nwill best suit his land. The new types have been developed under the\r\nbest tillage. Therefore if a farmer would keep the new type as good as\r\nit was when he began to grow it, he must give it the same good tillage,\r\nand practice seed-selection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 185. COTTON READY FOR PICKING]\r\n\r\nThe cotton plant is nourished by a tap-root that will seek food as\r\ndeeply as loose earth will permit the root to penetrate; hence, in\r\npreparing land for this crop the first plowing should be done at least\r\nwith a two-horse plow and should be deep and thorough. This deep plowing\r\nnot only allows the tap-root to penetrate, but it also admits a\r\ncirculation of air.\r\n\r\nOn some cotton farms it is the practice to break the land in winter or\r\nearly spring and then let it lie naked until planting-time. This is not\r\na good practice. The winter rains wash more plant food out of\r\nunprotected soil than a single crop would use. It would be better, in\r\nthe late summer or fall, to plant crimson clover or some other\r\nprotective and enriching crop on land that is to be planted in cotton in\r\nthe spring. This crop, in addition to keeping the land from being\r\ninjuriously washed, would greatly help the coming cotton crop by leaving\r\nthe soil full of vegetable matter.\r\n\r\nIn preparing for cotton-planting, first disk the land thoroughly, then\r\nbreak with a heavy plow and harrow until a fine and mellow seed-bed is\r\nformed. Do not spare the harrow at this time. It destroys many a weed\r\nthat, if allowed to grow, would have to be cut by costly hoeing.\r\nThorough work before planting saves much expensive work in the later\r\ndays of the crop. Moreover, no man can afford to allow his plant food\r\nand moisture to go to nourish weeds, even for a short time.\r\n\r\nThe rows should be from three to four feet apart. The width depends upon\r\nthe richness of the soil. On rich land the rows should be at least four\r\nfeet apart. This width allows the luxuriant plant to branch and fruit\r\nwell. On poorer lands the distance of the rows should not be so great.\r\nThe distribution of the seed in the row is of course most cheaply done\r\nby the planter. As a rule it is best not to ridge the land for the seed.\r\nFlat culture saves moisture and often prevents damage to the roots. In\r\nsome sections, however, where the land is flat and full of water,\r\nridging seems necessary if the land cannot be drained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186. PICKING COTTON]\r\n\r\nThe cheapest way of cultivating a crop is to prevent grass and weeds\r\nfrom rooting, not to wait to destroy them after they are well rooted. To\r\ndo this, it is well to run the two-horse smoothing-harrow over the\r\nland, across the rows, a few days after the young plants are up. Repeat\r\nthe harrowing in six or eight days. In addition to destroying the young\r\ngrass and weeds, this harrowing also removes many of the young cotton\r\nplants and thereby saves much hoeing at \"chopping-out\" time. When the\r\nplants are about two inches high they are \"chopped out\" to secure an\r\nevenly distributed stand. It has been the custom to leave two stalks to\r\na hill, but many growers are now leaving only one.\r\n\r\nThe number of times the crop has to be worked depends on the soil and\r\nthe season. If the soil is dry and porous, cultivate as often as\r\npossible, especially after each rain. Never allow a crust to form after\r\na rain; the roots of plants must have air. Cultivation after each rain\r\nforms a dry mulch on the top of the soil and thus prevents rapid\r\nevaporation of moisture.\r\n\r\nIf the fiber (the lint) only is removed from the land on which cotton is\r\ngrown, cotton is the least exhaustive of the great crops grown in the\r\nUnited States. According to some recent experiments an average crop of\r\ncotton removes in the lint only 2.75 pounds of nitrogen, phosphoric\r\nacid, potash, lime, and magnesia per acre, while a crop of ten bushels\r\nof wheat per acre removes 32.36 pounds of the same elements of plant\r\nfood. Inasmuch as this crop takes so little plant food from the soil,\r\nthe cotton-farmer has no excuse for allowing his land to decrease in\r\nproductiveness. Two things will keep his land in bounteous harvest\r\ncondition: first, let him return the seeds in some form to the land, or,\r\nwhat is better, feed the ground seeds to cattle, make a profit from the\r\ncattle, and return manure to the land in place of the seeds; second, at\r\nthe last working, let him sow some crop like crimson clover or rye in\r\nthe cotton rows to protect the soil during the winter and to leave humus\r\nin the ground for the spring.\r\n\r\nThe stable manure, if that is used, should be broadcasted over the\r\nfields at the rate of six to ten tons an acre. If commercial fertilizers\r\nare used, it may be best to make two applications. To give the young\r\nplants a good start, apply a portion of the fertilizer in the drill just\r\nbefore planting. Then when the first blooms appear, put the remainder of\r\nthe fertilizer in drills near the plants but not too close. Many good\r\ncotton-growers, however, apply all the fertilizer at one time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 187. WEIGHING A DAY'S PICKING OF COTTON]\r\n\r\n_Relation of Stock to the Cotton Crop_. On many farms much of the money\r\nfor which the cotton is sold in the fall has to go to pay for the\r\ncommercial fertilizer used in growing the crop. Should not this fact\r\nsuggest efforts to raise just as good crops without having to buy so\r\nmuch fertilizer? Is there any way by which this can be done? The\r\nfollowing suggestions may be helpful. Raise enough stock to use all the\r\ncotton seed grown on the farm. To go with the food made from the cotton\r\nseed, grow on the farm pea-vine hay, clover, alfalfa, and other such\r\nnitrogen-gathering crops. This can be done at small cost. What will be\r\nthe result?\r\n\r\nFirst, to say nothing of the money made from the cattle, the large\r\nquantity of stable manure saved will largely reduce the amount of\r\ncommercial fertilizer needed. The cotton-farmer cannot afford to neglect\r\ncattle-raising. The cattle sections of the country are likely to make\r\nthe greatest progress in agriculture, because they have manure always on\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 188. MODERN COTTON BALES]\r\n\r\nSecond, the nitrogen-gathering crops, while helping to feed the stock,\r\nalso reduce the fertilizer bills by supplying one of the costly elements\r\nof the fertilizer. The ordinary cotton fertilizer consists principally\r\nof nitrogen, of potash, and of phosphoric acid. Of these three, by far\r\nthe most costly is nitrogen. Now peas, beans, clover, and peanuts will\r\nleave enough nitrogen in the soil for cotton, so that if they are\r\nraised, it is necessary to buy only phosphoric acid and sometimes\r\npotash.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVI. TOBACCO\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plant connects Indian agriculture with our own. It has\r\nalways been a source of great profit to our people. In the early\r\ncolonial days tobacco was almost the only money crop. Many rich men came\r\nto America in those days merely to raise tobacco.\r\n\r\nAlthough tobacco will grow in almost any climate, the leaves, which, as\r\nmost of you know, are the salable part of the plant, get their desirable\r\nor undesirable qualities very largely from the soil and from the climate\r\nin which they grow.\r\n\r\nThe soil in which tobacco thrives best is one which has the following\r\nqualities: dryness, warmth, richness, depth, and sandiness.\r\n\r\nCommercial fertilizers also are almost a necessity; for, as tobacco land\r\nis limited in area, the same land must be often planted in tobacco.\r\nHence even a fresh, rich soil that did not at first require fertilizing\r\nsoon becomes exhausted, and, after the land has been robbed of its plant\r\nfood by crop after crop of tobacco, frequent application of fertilizers\r\nand other manures becomes necessary. However, even tobacco growers\r\nshould rotate their crops as much as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 189. A LEAF OF TOBACCO]\r\n\r\nDeep plowing--from nine to thirteen inches--is also a necessity in\r\npreparing the land, for tobacco roots go deep into the soil. After this\r\ndeep plowing, harrow until the soil is thoroughly pulverized and is as\r\nfine and mellow as that of the flower-garden.\r\n\r\nUnlike most other farm crops the tobacco plant must be started first in\r\na seed-bed. To prepare a tobacco bed the almost universal custom has\r\nbeen to proceed as follows. Carefully select a protected spot. Over this\r\nspot pile brushwood and then burn it. The soil will be left dry, and all\r\nthe weed seeds will be killed. The bed is then carefully raked and\r\nsmoothed and planted. Some farmers are now preparing their beds without\r\nburning. A tablespoonful of seed will sow a patch twenty-five feet\r\nsquare. A cheap cloth cover is put over the bed. If the seeds come up\r\nwell, a patch of this size ought to furnish transplants for five or six\r\nacres. In sowing, it is not wise to cover the seed deeply. A light\r\nraking in or an even rolling of the ground is all that is needed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 190. A PROMISING CROP OF TOBACCO]\r\n\r\nThe time required for sprouting is from two to three weeks. The plants\r\nought to be ready for transplanting in from four to six weeks. Weeds\r\nand grass should of course be kept out of the seed-bed.\r\n\r\nThe plants, when ready, are transplanted in very much the same way as\r\ncabbages and tomatoes. The transplanting was formerly done by hand, but\r\nan effective machine is now widely used. The rows should be from three\r\nto three and a half feet apart, and the plants in the rows about two or\r\nthree feet apart. If the plants are set so that the plow and cultivator\r\ncan be run with the rows and also across the rows, they can be more\r\neconomically worked. Tobacco, like corn, requires shallow cultivation.\r\nOf course the plants should be worked often enough to give clean culture\r\nand to provide a soil mulch for saving moisture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 191. TOPPING TOBACCO]\r\n\r\nIn tobacco culture it is necessary to pinch off the \"buttons\" and to cut\r\noff the tops of the main stalk, else much nourishment that should go to\r\nthe leaves will be given to the seeds. The suckers must also be cut off\r\nfor the same reason.\r\n\r\nThe proper time for harvesting is not easily fixed; one becomes skillful\r\nin this work only through experience in the field. Briefly, we may say\r\nthat tobacco is ready to be cut when the leaves on being held up to the\r\nsun show a light or golden color, when they are sticky to the touch, and\r\nwhen they break easily on being bent. Plants that are overripe are\r\ninferior to those that are cut early.\r\n\r\nThe operations included in cutting, housing, drying, shipping, sweating,\r\nand packing require skill and practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVII. WHEAT\r\n\r\nWheat has been cultivated from earliest times. It was a chief crop in\r\nEgypt and Palestine, and still holds its importance in the temperate\r\nportions of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 192. A HAND]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 193. WHEAT HEADS]\r\n\r\nThis crop ranks third in value in the United States. It grows in cool,\r\nin temperate, and in warm climates, and in many kinds of soil. It does\r\nbest in clay loam, and worst in sandy soils. Clogged and water-soaked\r\nland will not grow wheat with profit to the farmer; for this reason,\r\nwhere good wheat-production is desired the soil must be well drained\r\nand in good physical condition--that is, the soil must be open, crumbly,\r\nand mellow.\r\n\r\nClay soils that are hard and lifeless can be made valuable for\r\nwheat-production by covering the surface with manure, by good tillage,\r\nand by a thorough system of crop-rotation. Cowpeas and other legumes\r\nmake a most valuable crop to precede wheat, for in growing they add\r\natmospheric nitrogen to the soil, and their roots loosen the root-bed,\r\nthereby admitting a free circulation of air and adding humus to the\r\nsoil. Moreover, the legumes leave the soil with its grains fairly close\r\npacked, and this is a help in wheat growing.\r\n\r\nOne may secure a good seed-bed after cotton and corn as well as after\r\ncowpeas and other legumes. They are summer-cultivated crops, and the\r\nclean culture that has been given them renders the surface soil mellow\r\nand the undersoil firm and compact. They are not so good, however, as\r\ncowpeas, since they add no atmospheric nitrogen to the soil, as all\r\nleguminous crops do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 194. ROOTS OF A SINGLE WHEAT PLANT]\r\n\r\nFrom one to two inches is the most satisfactory depth for planting\r\nwheat. The largest number of seeds comes up when planted at this depth.\r\nA mellow soil is very helpful to good coming up and provides a most\r\ncomfortable home for the roots of the plant. A compact soil below makes\r\na moist undersoil; and this is desirable, for the soil water is needed\r\nto dissolve plant food and to carry it up through the plant, where it is\r\nused in building tissue.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many varieties of wheat: some are bearded, others are\r\nsmooth; some are winter and others are spring varieties. The\r\nsmooth-headed varieties are most agreeable to handle during harvest and\r\nat threshing-time. Some of the bearded varieties, however, do so well in\r\nsome soils and climates that it is desirable to continue growing them,\r\nthough they are less agreeable to handle. No matter what variety you are\r\naccustomed to raise, it may be improved by careful seed-selection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 195. SELECTING WHEAT SEED]\r\n\r\nThe seed-drill is the best implement for planting wheat. It distributes\r\nthe grains evenly over the whole field and leaves the mellow soil in a\r\ncondition to catch what snow may fall and secure what protection it\r\naffords.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 196. ADJOINING WHEAT FIELDS\r\nThe yield of the lower field, forty-five bushels per acre, is due to\r\nintelligent farming]\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the country, because not enough live stock is raised,\r\nthere is often too little manure to apply to the wheat land. Where this\r\nis the case commercial fertilizers must be used. Since soils differ\r\ngreatly, it is impossible to suggest a fertilizer adapted to all soils.\r\nThe elements usually lacking in wheat soils are nitrogen, phosphoric\r\nacid, and potash. The land may be lacking in one of these plant foods or\r\nin all; in either case a maximum crop cannot possibly be raised. The\r\nsection on manuring the soil will be helpful to the wheat-grower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 197. A BOUNTIFUL CROP OF WHEAT]\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered always in buying fertilizers for wheat that\r\nwhenever wheat follows cowpeas or clover or other legumes there is\r\nseldom need of using nitrogen in the fertilizer; the tubercles on the\r\npea or clover roots will furnish that. Hence, as a rule, only potash and\r\nphosphoric acid will have to be purchased as plant food.\r\n\r\nThe farmer is assisted always by a study of his crop and by a knowledge\r\nof how it grows. If he find the straw inferior and short, it means that\r\nthe soil is deficient in nitrogen; but on the other hand, if the straw\r\nbe luxuriant and the heads small and poorly filled, he may be sure that\r\nhis soil contains too little phosphoric acid and potash.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     Let the pupils secure several heads of wheat and thresh each\r\n     separately by hand. The grains should then be counted and their\r\n     plumpness and size observed. The practical importance of this is\r\n     obvious, for the larger the heads and the greater the number of\r\n     grains, the larger the yield per acre. Let them plant some of the\r\n     large and some of the small grains. A single test of this kind will\r\n     show the importance of careful seed-selection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 198 A WIDELY GROWN CROP]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVIII. CORN\r\n\r\nWhen the white man came to this country he found the Indians using corn;\r\nfor this reason, in addition to its name _maize_, it is called _Indian\r\ncorn_. Before that time the civilized world did not know that there was\r\nsuch a crop. The increase in the yield and the extension of the acres\r\nplanted in this strictly American crop have kept pace with the rapid\r\nand wonderful growth of our country. Corn is king of the cereals and the\r\nmost important crop of American agriculture. It grows in almost every\r\nsection of America. There is hardly any limit to the uses to which its\r\ngrain and its stalks are now put. Animals of many kinds are fed on\r\nrations into which it enters. Its grains in some form furnish food to\r\nmore people than does any other crop except possibly rice. Its stalk and\r\nits cob are manufactured into many different and useful articles.\r\n\r\nA soil rich in either decaying animal or vegetable matter, loose, warm,\r\nand moist but not wet, will produce a better crop of corn than any\r\nother. Corn soil should always be well tilled and cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe proper time to begin the cultivation of corn is before it is\r\nplanted. Plow well. A shallow, worn-out soil should not be used for\r\ncorn, but for cowpeas or rye. After thorough plowing, the harrow--either\r\nthe disk or spring-tooth--should be used to destroy all clods and leave\r\nthe surface mellow and fine. The best results will be obtained by\r\nturning under a clover sod that has been manured from the savings of the\r\nbarnyard.\r\n\r\nWhen manure is not available, commercial fertilizers will often prove\r\nprofitable on poor lands. Careful trials will best determine how much\r\nfertilizer to an acre is necessary, and what kinds are to be used. A\r\nlittle study and experimenting on the farmer's part will soon enable him\r\nto find out both the kind and the amount of fertilizer that is best\r\nsuited to his land.\r\n\r\nThe seed for this crop should be selected according to the plan\r\nsuggested in Section XIX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 199. CORN SHOCKED FOR THE SHREDDER]\r\n\r\nThe most economical method of planting is by means of the horse planter,\r\nwhich, according to its adjustment, plants regularly in hills or in\r\ndrills. A few days after planting, the cornfield should be harrowed with\r\na fine-tooth harrow to loosen the top soil and to kill the grass and the\r\nweed seeds that are germinating at the surface. When the corn plants\r\nare from a half inch to an inch high, the harrow may again be used. A\r\nlittle work before the weeds sprout will save many days of labor during\r\nthe rest of the season, and increase the yield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 200. THE DIFFERENCE IS DUE TO TILLAGE]\r\n\r\nCorn is a crop that needs constant cultivation, and during the growing\r\nseason the soil should be stirred at least four times. This cultivation\r\nis for three reasons:\r\n\r\n1. To destroy weeds that would take plant food and water.\r\n\r\n2. To provide a mulch of dry soil so as to prevent the evaporation of\r\nmoisture. The action of this mulch has already been explained.\r\n\r\n3. Because \"tillage is manure.\" Constant stirring of the soil allows the\r\nair to circulate in it, provides a more effective mulch, and helps to\r\nchange unavailable plant food into the form that plants use.\r\n\r\nDeep culture of corn is not advisable. The roots in their early stages\r\nof growth are shallow feeders and spread widely only a few inches below\r\nthe surface. The cultivation that destroys or disturbs the roots injures\r\nthe plants and lessens the yield. We cultivate because of the three\r\nreasons given above, and not to stir the soil about the roots or to\r\nloosen it there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 201.]\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the country the cornstalks are left standing in the\r\nfields or are burned. This is a great mistake, for the stalks are worth\r\na good deal for feeding horses, cattle, and sheep. These stalks may\r\nalways be saved by the use of the husker and shredder. Corn after being\r\nmatured and cut can be put in shocks and left thus until dry enough to\r\nrun through the husker and shredder. This machine separates the corn\r\nfrom the stalk and husks it. At the same time it shreds tops, leaves,\r\nand butts into a food that is both nutritious and palatable to stock.\r\nFor the amount that animals will eat, almost as much feeding value is\r\nobtained from corn stover treated in this way as from timothy hay. The\r\npractice of not using the stalks is wasteful and is fast being\r\nabandoned. The only reason that so much good food is being left to decay\r\nin the field is because so many people have not fully learned the\r\nfeeding value of the stover.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =EXERCISE=\r\n\r\n     To show the effect of cultivation on the yield of corn, let the\r\n     pupils lay off five plats in some convenient field. Each plat need\r\n     consist of only two rows about twenty feet long. Treat each plat as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n     Plat 1. No cultivation: let weeds grow.\r\n\r\n     Plat 2. Mulch with straw.\r\n\r\n     Plat 3. Shallow cultivation: not deeper than two inches and at\r\n     least five times during the growing season.\r\n\r\n     Plat 4. Deep cultivation: at least four inches deep, so as to\r\n     injure and tear out some of the roots (this is a common method).\r\n\r\n     Plat 5. Root-pruning: ten inches from the stalk and six inches\r\n     deep, prune the roots with a long knife. Cultivate five times\r\n     during the season.\r\n\r\n     Observe plats during the summer, and at husking-time note results.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIX. PEANUTS\r\n\r\nThis plant is rich in names, being known locally as \"ground pea,\"\r\n\"goober,\" \"earthnut,\" and \"pindar,\" as well as generally by the name of\r\n\"peanut.\" The peanut is a true legume, and, like other legumes, bears\r\nnitrogen-gathering tubercles upon its roots. The fruit is not a real nut\r\nbut rather a kind of pea or bean, and develops from the blossom. After\r\nthe fall of the blossom the \"spike,\" or flower-stalk, pushes its way\r\ninto the ground, where the nut develops. If unable to penetrate the soil\r\nthe nut dies.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, North and South Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee\r\nhave the most favorable climates for peanut culture. Suitable climate\r\nand soil, however, may be found from New Jersey to the Mississippi\r\nvalley. A high, porous, sandy loam is the most suitable. Stiffer soils,\r\nwhich may in some cases yield larger crops than the loams, are yet not\r\nso profitable, for stiff soils injure the color of the nut. Lime is a\r\nnecessity and must be supplied if the soil is deficient. Phosphoric acid\r\nand potash are needed.\r\n\r\nGreater care than is usually bestowed should be given to the selection\r\nof the peanut seed. In addition to following the principles given in\r\nSection XVIII, all musty, defective seeds must be avoided and all\r\nfrosted kernels must be rejected. Before it dries, the peanut seed is\r\neasily injured by frost. The slightest frost on the vines, either before\r\nor after the plants are dug, does much harm to the tender seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 202. A PEANUT PLANT]\r\n\r\nIn growing peanuts, thorough preparation of the soil is much better than\r\nlater cultivation. Destroy the crop of young weeds, but do not disturb\r\nthe peanut crop by late cultivation. Harvest before frost, and shock\r\nhigh to keep the vines from the ground.\r\n\r\nThe average yield of peanuts in the United States is twenty-two bushels\r\nan acre. In Tennessee the yield is twenty-nine bushels an acre, and in\r\nNorth Carolina and Virginia it reaches thirty bushels an acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XL. SWEET POTATOES\r\n\r\nThe roots of sweet potatoes are put on the market in various forms.\r\nAside from the form in which they are ordinarily sold, some potatoes are\r\ndried and then ground into flour, some are canned, some are used to make\r\nstarch, some furnish a kind of sugar called glucose, and some are even\r\nused to make alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there are over eighty varieties of potatoes shows the\r\npopularity of the plant. Now it is evident that all of these varieties\r\ncannot be equally desirable. Hence the wise grower will select his\r\nvarieties with prudent forethought. He should study his market, his\r\nsoil, and his seed (see Section XVIII).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 203. SWEET POTATOES]\r\n\r\nFour months of mild weather, months free from frost and cold winds, are\r\nnecessary for the growing of sweet potatoes. In a mild climate almost\r\nany loose, well-drained soil will produce them. A light, sandy loam,\r\nhowever, gives a cleaner potato and one, therefore, that sells better.\r\n\r\nThe sweet potato draws potash, nitrogen, and phosphoric acid from the\r\nsoil, but in applying these as fertilizers the grower must study and\r\nknow his own soil. If he does not he may waste both money and plant food\r\nby the addition of elements already present in sufficient quantity in\r\nthe soil. The only way to come to reliable conclusions as to the needs\r\nof the soil is to try two or three different kinds of fertilizers on\r\nplats of the same soil, during the same season, and notice the resulting\r\ncrop of potatoes.\r\n\r\nSweet potatoes will do well after almost any of the usual field crops.\r\nThis caution, however, should be borne in mind. Potatoes should not\r\nfollow a sod. This is because sods are often thick with cutworms, one of\r\nthe serious enemies of the potato.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the ground must be kept clean by thorough\r\ncultivation until the vines take full possession of the field.\r\n\r\nIn harvesting, extreme care should be used to avoid cutting and bruising\r\nthe potato, since bruises are as dangerous to a sweet potato as to an\r\napple, and render decay almost a certainty. Lay aside all bruised\r\npotatoes for immediate use.\r\n\r\nFor shipment the potatoes should be graded and packed with care. An\r\nextra outlay of fifty cents a barrel often brings a return of a dollar a\r\nbarrel in the market. One fact often neglected by Southern growers who\r\nraise potatoes for a Northern market is that the Northern markets demand\r\na potato that will cook dry and mealy, and that they will not accept the\r\njuicy, sugary potato so popular in the South.\r\n\r\nThe storage of sweet potatoes presents difficulties owing to their great\r\ntendency to decay under the influence of the ever-present fungi and\r\nbacteria. This tendency can be met by preventing bruises and by keeping\r\nthe bin free from rotting potatoes. The potatoes should be cleaned, and\r\nafter the moisture has been dried off they should be stored in a dry,\r\nwarm place.\r\n\r\nThe sweet-potato vine makes a fair quality of hay and with proper\r\nprecaution may be used for ensilage. Small, defective, unsalable\r\npotatoes are rich in sugar and starch and are therefore good stock food.\r\nSince they contain so much water they must be used only as an aid to\r\nother diet.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLI. WHITE, OR IRISH, POTATOES\r\n\r\nMaize, or Indian corn, and potatoes are the two greatest gifts in the\r\nway of food that America has bestowed on the other nations. Since their\r\nadoption in the sixteenth century as a new food from recently discovered\r\nAmerica, white potatoes have become one of the world's most important\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 204. CULTIVATING AND RIDGING POTATOES]\r\n\r\nNo grower will harvest large crops of potatoes unless he chooses soil\r\nthat suits the plant, selects his seed carefully, cultivates thoroughly,\r\nfeeds his land sufficiently, and sprays regularly.\r\n\r\nThe soil should be free from potato scab. This disease remains in land\r\nfor several years. Hence if land is known to have any form of scab in\r\nit, do not plant potatoes in such land. Select for this crop a deep and\r\nmoderately light, sandy loam which has an open subsoil and which is rich\r\nin humus. The soil must be light enough for the potatoes, or tubers, to\r\nenlarge easily and dry enough to prevent rot or blight or other\r\ndiseases. Potato soil should be so close-grained that it will hold\r\nmoisture during a dry spell and yet so well-drained that the tubers will\r\nnot be hurt by too much moisture in wet weather.\r\n\r\nIf the land selected for potatoes is lacking in humus, fine compost or\r\nwell-rotted manure will greatly increase the yield. However, it should\r\nbe remembered that green manure makes a good home for the growth of scab\r\ngerms. Hence it is safest to apply this sort of manure in the fall, or,\r\nbetter still, use a heavy dressing of manure on the crop which the\r\npotatoes are to follow. Leguminous crops supply both humus and nitrogen\r\nand, at the same time, improve the subsoil. Therefore such crops are\r\nexcellent to go immediately before potatoes. If land is well supplied\r\nwith humus, commercial fertilizers are perhaps safer than manure, for\r\nwhen these fertilizers are used the amount of plant food is more easily\r\nregulated. Select a fertilizer that is rich in potash. For gardens\r\nunleached wood ashes make a valuable fertilizer because they supply\r\npotash. Early potatoes need more fertilization than do late ones. While\r\npotatoes do best on rich land, they should not be overfed, for a too\r\nheavy growth of foliage is likely to cause blight.\r\n\r\nBe careful to select seed from sound potatoes which are entirely free\r\nfrom scab. Get the kinds that thrive best in the section in which they\r\nare to be planted and which suit best the markets in which they are to\r\nbe sold. Seed potatoes should be kept in a cool place so that they will\r\nnot sprout before planting-time. As a rule consumers prefer a smooth,\r\nregularly shaped, shallow-eyed white or flesh-colored potato which is\r\nmealy when cooked. Therefore, select seed tubers with these qualities.\r\nIt seems proved that when whole potatoes are used for seed the yield is\r\nlarger than when sliced potatoes are planted. It is of course too\r\ncostly to plant whole potatoes, but it is a good practice to cause the\r\nplants to thrive by planting large seed pieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 205. GATHERING POTATOES]\r\n\r\nLike other crops, potatoes need a thoroughly prepared seed-bed and\r\nintelligent cultivation. Break the land deep. Then go over it with an\r\nordinary harrow until all clods are broken and the soil is fine and well\r\nclosed. The rows should be at least three feet from one another and the\r\nseeds placed from twelve to eighteen inches apart in the row, and\r\ncovered to a depth of three or four inches. A late crop should be\r\nplanted deeper than an early one. Before the plants come up it is well\r\nto go over the field once or twice with a harrow so as to kill all\r\nweeds. Do not fail to save moisture by frequent cultivation. After the\r\nplants start to grow, all cultivation should be shallow, for the roots\r\nfeed near the surface and should not be broken. Cultivate as often as\r\nneeded to keep down weeds and grass and to keep the ground fine.\r\n\r\nAllow potatoes to dry thoroughly before they are stored, but never allow\r\nthem to remain long in the sunshine. Never dig them in damp weather, for\r\nthe moisture clinging to them will cause them to rot. After the tubers\r\nare dry, store them in barrels or bins in a dry, cool, and dark place.\r\nNever allow them to freeze.\r\n\r\nAmong the common diseases and insect pests that attack the leaves and\r\nstems of potato vines are early blight, late blight, brown rot, the\r\nflea-beetle, and the potato beetle, or potato bug. Spraying with\r\nBordeaux mixture to which a small portion of Paris green has been added\r\nwill control both the diseases and the pests. The spraying should begin\r\nwhen the plants are five or six inches high and should not cease until\r\nthe foliage begins to die.\r\n\r\nScab is a disease of the tubers. It may be prevented (1) by using seed\r\npotatoes that are free from scab; (2) by planting land in which there is\r\nno scab; and (3) by soaking the seed in formalin (see page 135).\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLII. OATS\r\n\r\nThe oat plant belongs to the grass family. It is a hardy plant and,\r\nunder good conditions, a vigorous grower. It stands cold and wet better\r\nthan any other cereal except possibly rye. Oats like a cool, moist\r\nclimate. In warm climates, oats do best when they are sowed in the fall.\r\nIn cooler sections, spring seeding is more generally practiced.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many varieties of oats. No one variety is best adapted\r\nto all sections, but many varieties make fine crops in many sections.\r\nAny variety is desirable which has these qualities: power to resist\r\ndisease and insect enemies, heavy grains, thin hulls, good color, and\r\nsuitability to local surroundings.\r\n\r\nAs oats and rye make a better yield on poor land than any other cereals,\r\nsome farmers usually plant these crops on their poorest lands. However,\r\nno land is too good to be used for so valuable a crop as oats. Oats\r\nrequire a great deal of moisture; hence light, sandy soils are not so\r\nwell adapted to this crop as are the sandy loams and fine clay loams\r\nwith their closer and heavier texture.\r\n\r\nIf oats are to be planted in the spring, the ground should be broken in\r\nthe fall, winter, or early spring so that no delay may occur at\r\nseeding-time. But to have a thoroughly settled, compact seed-bed the\r\nbreaking of the land should be done at least a month before the seeding,\r\nand it will help greatly to run over the land with a disk harrow\r\nimmediately after the breaking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 206. OATS\r\nCommon oats at left; side oats at right]\r\n\r\nOats may be planted by scattering them broadcast or by means of a drill.\r\nThe drill is better, because the grains are more uniformly distributed\r\nand the depth of planting is better regulated. The seeds should be\r\ncovered from one and a half to two inches deep. In a very dry season\r\nthree inches may not be too deep. The amount of seed needed to the acre\r\nvaries considerably, but generally the seeding is from two to three\r\nbushels an acre. On poor lands two bushels will be a fair average\r\nseeding; on good lands as much as three bushels should be used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 207. HARVESTING OATS]\r\n\r\nThis crop fits in well, over wide areas, with various rotations. As the\r\npurpose of all rotation is to keep the soil productive, oats should\r\nalternate every few years with one of the nitrogen-gathering crops. In\r\nthe South, cowpeas, soy beans, clovers, and vetches may be used in this\r\nrotation. In the North and West the clovers mixed with timothy hay make\r\na useful combination for this purpose.\r\n\r\nSpring-sowed oats, since they have a short growing season, need their\r\nnitrogenous plant food in a form which can be quickly used. To supply\r\nthis nitrogen a top-dressing of nitrate of soda or sulphate of lime is\r\nhelpful. The plant can gather its food quickly from either of these\r\ntwo. As fall-sowed oats have of course a longer growing season, the\r\nnitrogen can be supplied by well-rotted manure, blood, tankage, or\r\nfish-scrap. Use barnyard manure carefully. Do not apply too much just\r\nbefore seeding, and use only thoroughly rotted manure. It is always\r\ndesirable to have a bountiful supply of humus in land on which oats are\r\nto be planted.\r\n\r\nThe time of harvesting will vary with the use which is to be made of the\r\noats. If the crop is to be threshed, the harvesting should be done when\r\nthe kernels have passed out of the milk into the hard dough state. The\r\nlower leaves of the stalks will at this time have turned yellow, and the\r\nkernels will be plump and full. Do not, however, wait too long, for if\r\nyou do the grain will shatter and the straw lose in feeding value.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the oats are to be cut for hay it is best to cut\r\nthem while the grains are still in the milk stage. At this stage the\r\nleaves are still green and the plants are rich in protein.\r\n\r\nOats should be cured quickly. It is very important that threshed oats\r\nshould be dry before they are stored. Should they on being stored still\r\ncontain moisture, they will be likely to heat and to discolor. Any\r\ndiscoloring will reduce their value. Nor should oats ever be allowed to\r\nremain long in the fields, no matter how well they may seem to be\r\nshocked. The dew and the rain will injure their value by discoloring\r\nthem more or less.\r\n\r\nOats are muscle-builders rather than fat-formers. Hence they are a\r\nvaluable ration for work animals, dairy cows, and breeding-stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLIII. RYE\r\n\r\nRye has the power of gathering its food from a wider area than most\r\nother plants. Of course, then, it is a fine crop for poor land, and\r\nfarmers often plant it only on worn land. However, it is too good a\r\ncereal to be treated in so ungenerous a fashion. As a cover-crop for\r\npoor land it adds much humus to the soil and makes capital grazing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 208. RYE READY FOR CUTTING]\r\n\r\nThere are two types of rye--the winter and the spring. The winter type\r\nis chiefly grown in this country. Rye seeds should be bought as near\r\nhome as possible, for this plant thrives best when the new crop grows\r\nunder the same conditions as the seed crop.\r\n\r\nRye will grow on almost any soil that is drained. Soils that are too\r\nsandy for wheat will generally yield good crops of rye. Clay soils,\r\nhowever, are not adapted to the plant nor to the grazing for which the\r\nplant is generally sowed. For winter rye the land should be broken from\r\nfour to six inches. Harrows should follow the plows until the land is\r\nwell pulverized. In some cold prairie lands, however, rye is put in with\r\na grain-drill before a plow removes the stubble from the land. The\r\npurpose of planting in this way is to let the stubble protect the young\r\nplants from cold, driving winds.\r\n\r\nRye should go into the ground earlier than wheat. In cold, bleak\r\nclimates, as well as on poor land, the seeding should be early. The\r\nyoung plant needs to get rooted and topped before cold weather sets in.\r\nThe only danger in very early planting is that leaf-rust sometimes\r\nattacks the forward crop. Of course the earlier the rye is ready for\r\nfall and winter pasturage, the better. If a drill is used for planting,\r\na seeding of from three to four pecks to the acre should give a good\r\nstand. In case the seeds are to be sowed broadcast, a bushel or a bushel\r\nand a half for every acre is needed. The seed should be covered as wheat\r\nseed is and the ground rolled.\r\n\r\nRye is generally used as a grazing or as a soiling crop. Therefore its\r\nvalue will depend largely on its vigorous growth in stems and leaves. To\r\nget this growth, liberal amounts of nitrogenous fertilizer will have to\r\nbe applied unless the land is very rich. Put barnyard manure on the land\r\njust after the first breaking and disk the manure into the soil. Acid\r\nphosphate and kainite added to the manure may pay handsomely. A spring\r\ntop-dressing of nitrate of soda is usually helpful.\r\n\r\nRye has a stiff straw and does not fall, or \"lodge,\" so badly as some of\r\nthe other cereals. As soon as rye that is meant for threshing is cut, it\r\nshould be put up in shocks until it is thoroughly dry. Begin the cutting\r\nwhen the kernels are in a tough dough state. The grain should never\r\nstand long in the shocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLIV. BARLEY\r\n\r\nBarley is one of the oldest crops known to man. The old historian Pliny\r\nsays that barley was the first food of mankind. Modern man however\r\nprefers wheat and corn and potatoes to barley, and as a food this\r\nancient crop is in America turned over to the lower animals. Brewers use\r\nbarley extensively in making malt liquors. Barley grows in nearly all\r\nsections of our country, but a few states--namely, Minnesota,\r\nCalifornia, Wisconsin, Iowa, and North and South Dakota--are seeding\r\nlarge areas to this crop.\r\n\r\nFor malting purposes the barley raised on rather light, friable, porous\r\nsoil is best. Soils of this kind are likely to produce a medium yield of\r\nbright grain. Fertile loamy and clay soils make generally a heavier\r\nyield of barley, but the grain is dark and fit only to be fed to stock.\r\nBarley is a shallow feeder, and can reach only such plant food as is\r\nfound in the top soil, so its food should always be put within reach by\r\na thorough breaking, harrowing, and mellowing of the soil, and by\r\nfertilizing if the soil is poor. Barley has been successfully raised\r\nboth by irrigation and by dry-farming methods. It requires a\r\nbetter-prepared soil than the other grain crops; it makes fine yields\r\nwhen it follows some crop that has received a heavy dressing of manure.\r\nCapital yields are produced after alfalfa or after root crops. This crop\r\nusually matures within a hundred days from its seeding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 209. BARLEY]\r\n\r\nWhen the crop is to be sold to the brewers, a grain rich in starch\r\nshould be secured. Barley intended for malting should be fertilized to\r\nthis end. Many experiments have shown that a fertilizer which contains\r\nmuch potash will produce starchy barley. If the barley be intended for\r\nstock, you should breed so as to get protein in the grain and in the\r\nstalk. Hence barley which is to be fed should be fertilized with\r\nmixtures containing nitrogen and phosphoric acid. Young barley plants\r\nare more likely to be hurt by cold than either wheat or oats. Hence\r\nbarley ought not to be seeded until all danger from frost is over. The\r\nseeds should be covered deeper than the seeds of wheat or of oats. Four\r\ninches is perhaps an average depth for covering. But the covering will\r\nvary with the time of planting, with the kind of ground, with the\r\nclimate, and with the nature of the season. Fewer seeds will be needed\r\nif the barley is planted by means of a drill.\r\n\r\nLike other cereals, barley should not be grown continuously on the same\r\nland. It should take its place in a well-planned rotation. It may\r\nprofitably follow potatoes or other hoed crops, but it should not come\r\nfirst after wheat, oats, or rye.\r\n\r\nBarley should be harvested as soon as most of its kernels have reached\r\nthe hard dough state. It is more likely to shatter its grain than are\r\nother cereals, and it should therefore be handled with care. It must\r\nalso be watched to prevent its sprouting in the shocks. Be sure to put\r\nfew bundles in the shock and to cap the shock securely enough to keep\r\nout dew and rain. If possible the barley should be threshed directly\r\nfrom the shock, as much handling will occasion a serious loss from\r\nshattering.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLV. SUGAR PLANTS\r\n\r\nIn the United States there are three sources from which sugar is\r\nobtained; namely, the sugar-maple, the sugar-beet, and the sugar-cane.\r\nIn the early days of our country considerable quantities of maple sirup\r\nand maple sugar were made. This was the first source of sugar. Then\r\nsugar-cane began to be grown. Later the sugar-beet was introduced.\r\n\r\n=Maple Products.= In many states sirup and sugar are still made from\r\nmaple sap. In the spring when the sap is flowing freely maple trees are\r\ntapped and spouts are inserted. Through these spouts the sap flows into\r\nvessels set to catch it. The sap is boiled in evaporating-pans, and made\r\ninto either sirup or sugar. Four gallons of sap yield about one pound of\r\nsugar. A single tree yields from two to six pounds of sugar in a season.\r\nThe sap cannot be kept long after it is collected. Practice and skill\r\nare needed to produce an attractive and palatable grade of sirup or of\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n=Sugar-Beets.= The sugar-beet is a comparatively new root crop in\r\nAmerica. The amount of sugar that can be obtained from beets varies from\r\ntwelve to twenty per cent. The richness in sugar depends somewhat on the\r\nvariety grown and on the soil and the climate.\r\n\r\nSo far most of our sugar-beet seeds have been brought over from Europe.\r\nSome of our planters are now, however, gaining the skill and the\r\nknowledge needed to grow these seeds. It is of course important to grow\r\nseeds that will produce beets containing much sugar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 210. CATCHING MAPLE SAP]\r\n\r\nThese beets do well in a great variety of soils if the land is rich,\r\nwell prepared, and well drained, and has a porous subsoil.\r\n\r\nBeets cannot grow to a large size in hard land. Hence deep plowing is\r\nvery necessary for this crop. The soil should be loose enough for the\r\nwhole body of the beet to remain underground. Some growers prefer spring\r\nplowing and some fall plowing, but all agree that the land should not be\r\nturned less than eight or ten inches. The subsoil, however, should not\r\nbe turned up too much at the first deep plowing.\r\n\r\nToo much care cannot be taken to make the seed-bed firm and mellow and\r\nto have it free from clods. If the soil is dry at planting-time and\r\nthere is likelihood of high winds, the seed-bed may be rolled with\r\nprofit. Experienced growers use from ten to twelve pounds of seeds to an\r\nacre. It is better to use too many rather than too few seeds, for it is\r\neasy to thin out the plants, but rather difficult to transplant them.\r\nThe seeds are usually drilled in rows about twenty inches apart. Of\r\ncourse, if the soil is rather warm and moist at planting-time, fewer\r\nseeds will be needed than when germination is likely to be slow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 211. SUGAR-BEET]\r\n\r\nA good rotation should always be planned for this beet. A very\r\nsuccessful one is as follows: for the first year, corn heavily\r\nfertilized with stable manure; for the second year, sugar-beets; for the\r\nthird year, oats or barley; for the fourth year, clover; then go back\r\nagain to corn. In addition to keeping the soil fertile, there are two\r\ngains from this rotation: first, the clean cultivation of the corn crop\r\njust ahead of the beets destroys many of the weed seeds; second, the\r\nbeets must be protected from too much nitrogen in the soil, for an\r\nexcess of nitrogen makes a beet too large to be rich in sugar. The\r\nmanure, heavily applied to the corn, will leave enough nitrogen and\r\nother plant food in the soil to make a good crop of beets and avoid any\r\ndanger of an excess.\r\n\r\nWhen the outside leaves of the beet take on a yellow tinge and drop to\r\nthe ground, the beets are ripe. The mature beets are richer in sugar\r\nthan the immature, therefore they should not be harvested too soon. They\r\nmay remain in the ground without injury for some time after they are\r\nripe. Cold weather does not injure the roots unless it is accompanied by\r\nfreezing and thawing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 212. SUGAR-BEETS ON THE WAY TO A FACTORY]\r\n\r\nThe beets are harvested by sugar-beet pullers or by hand. If the roots\r\nare to be gathered by hand they are usually loosened by plowing on each\r\nside of them. If the roots are stored they should be put in long, narrow\r\npiles and covered with straw and earth to protect them from frost. A\r\nventilator placed at the top of the pile will enable the heat and\r\nmoisture to escape. If the beets get too warm they will ferment and some\r\nof their sugar will be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sugar-Cane.= Sugar-cane is grown along the Gulf of Mexico and the South\r\nAtlantic coast. In Mississippi, in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South\r\nCarolina, northern Louisiana, and in northern Texas it is generally made\r\ninto sirup. In southern Louisiana and southern Texas the cane is usually\r\ncrushed for sugar or for molasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 213. STALK OF SUGAR-CANE\r\n_A-B_, joints of cane showing roots; _B-C_, stem; _C-D_, leaves]\r\n\r\nThe sugar-cane is a huge grass. The stalk, which is round, is from one\r\nto two inches in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe stalks vary in color. Some are white, some yellow, some green, some\r\nred, some purple, and some black, while others are a mixture of two or\r\nthree of these colors. As shown in Fig. 214 the stalk has joints at\r\ndistances of from two to six inches. These joints are called nodes, and\r\nthe sections between the nodes are known as internodes. The internodes\r\nripen from the roots upward, and as each ripens it casts its leaves. The\r\nstalk, when ready for harvesting, has only a few leaves on the top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214. STICK OF SUGAR-CANE\r\n_A_, buds, or eyes; _C_, nodes; _D_, internodes; _X_, semi-transparent\r\ndots in rows]\r\n\r\nUnder each leaf and on alternate sides of the cane a bud, or \"eye,\"\r\nforms. From this eye the cane is usually propagated; for, while in\r\ntropical countries the cane forms seeds, yet these seeds are rarely\r\nfertile. When the cane is ripe it is stripped of leaves, topped, and cut\r\nat the ground with a knife. The sugar is contained in solution in the\r\npith of the cane.\r\n\r\nCane requires an enormous amount of water for its best growth, and where\r\nthe rainfall is not great enough, the plants are irrigated. It requires\r\nfrom seventy-five to one hundred gallons of water to make a pound of\r\nsugar. Cane does best where there is a rainfall of two inches a week. At\r\nthe same time a well-drained soil is necessary to make vigorous canes.\r\n\r\nThe soils suited to this plant are those which contain large amounts of\r\nfertilizing material and which can hold much water. In southern\r\nLouisiana alluvial loams and loamy clay soils are cultivated. In\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, and Florida light, sandy soils, when properly\r\nfertilized and worked, make good crops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 215. PLANTING SUGAR-CANE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 216. LOADING SUGAR-CANE]\r\n\r\nCane is usually planted in rows from five to six feet apart. A trench is\r\nopened in the center of the row with a plow and in this open furrow is\r\nplaced a continuous line of stalks which are carefully covered with\r\nplow, cultivator, or hoe. From one to three continuous lines of stalks\r\nare placed in the furrow. From two to six tons of seed cane are needed\r\nfor an acre. In favorable weather the cane soon sprouts and cultivation\r\nbegins. Cane should be cultivated at short intervals until the plants\r\nare large enough to shade the soil. In Louisiana one planting of cane\r\nusually gives two crops. The first is called plant cane; the second is\r\nknown as first-year stubble, or ratoon. Sometimes second-year stubble is\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 217. A COMMON TYPE OF SIRUP FACTORY]\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana large quantities of tankage, cotton-seed meal, and acid\r\nphosphate are used to fertilize cane-fields. Each country has its own\r\ntime for planting and harvesting. In Louisiana, for example, canes are\r\nplanted from October to April. In the United States cane is harvested\r\neach year because of frost, but in tropical countries the stalks are\r\npermitted to grow from fifteen to twenty-four months.\r\n\r\nOn many farms a small mill, the rollers of which are turned by horses,\r\nis used for crushing the juice out of the cane. The juice is then\r\nevaporated in a kettle or pan. This equipment is very cheap and can\r\neasily be operated by a small family. While these mills rarely extract\r\nmore than one half of the juice in the cane, the sirup made by them is\r\nvery palatable and usually commands a good price. Costly machinery which\r\nsaves most of the juice is used in the large commercial sugar houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLVI. HEMP AND FLAX\r\n\r\nIn the early ages of the world, mankind is supposed to have worn very\r\nlittle or no clothing. Then leaves and the inner bark of trees were\r\nfashioned into a protection from the weather. These flimsy garments were\r\nlater replaced by skins and furs. As man advanced in knowledge, he\r\nlearned how to twist wool and hairs into threads and to weave these into\r\ndurable garments. Still later, perhaps, he discovered that some plants\r\nconceal under their outer bark soft, tough fibers that can be changed\r\ninto excellent cloth. Flax and hemp were doubtless among the first\r\nplants to furnish this fiber.\r\n\r\n=Flax.= Among the fiber crops of the world, flax ranks next to cotton.\r\nIt is the material from which is woven the linen for sheets, towels,\r\ntablecloths, shirts, collars, dresses, and a host of other articles.\r\nFortunately for man, flax will thrive in many countries and in many\r\nclimates. The fiber from which these useful articles are made, unlike\r\ncotton fiber, does not come from the fruit, but from the stem. It is the\r\nsoft, silky lining of the bark which lies between the woody outside and\r\nthe pith cells of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe Old World engages largely in flax culture and flax manufacture, but\r\nin our country flax is grown principally for its seed. From the seeds we\r\nmake linseed oil, linseed-oil cake, and linseed meal.\r\n\r\nFlax grows best on deep, loamy soils, but also makes a profitable growth\r\non clay soils. With sufficient fertilizing material it can be grown on\r\nsandy lands. Nitrogen is especially needed by this plant and should be\r\nliberally supplied. To meet this demand for nitrogen, it pays to plant a\r\nleguminous crop immediately before flax.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 218. FLAX]\r\n\r\nAfter a mellow seed-bed has been made ready and after the weather is\r\nfairly warm, sow, if a seed crop is desired, at the rate of from two to\r\nthree pecks an acre. A good seed crop will not be harvested if the\r\nplants are too thick. On the other hand, if a fiber crop is to be\r\nraised, it is desirable to plant more thickly, so that the stalks may\r\nnot branch, but run up into a single stem. From a bushel to two bushels\r\nof seed is in this case used to an acre. Flax requires care and work\r\nfrom start to finish.\r\n\r\nWhen the seeds are full and plump the flax is ready for harvesting. In\r\nAmerica a binder is generally used for cutting the stalks. Our average\r\nyield of flax is from eight to fifteen bushels an acre.\r\n\r\n=Hemp.= Like flax, hemp adapts itself wonderfully to many countries and\r\nmany climates. However, in America most of our hemp is grown in\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 219. CUTTING HEMP]\r\n\r\nHemp needs soil rich enough to give the young plants a very rapid growth\r\nin their early days so that they may form long fibers. To give this crop\r\nabundant nitrogen without great cost, it should be grown in a rotation\r\nwhich includes one of the legumes. Rich, well-drained bottom-lands\r\nproduce the largest yields of hemp, but uplands which have been heavily\r\nmanured make profitable yields.\r\n\r\nThe ground for hemp is prepared as for other grain crops. The seed is\r\ngenerally broadcasted for a fiber crop and then harrowed in. No\r\ncultivation is required after seeding.\r\n\r\nIf hemp is grown for seed, it is best to plant with a drill so that the\r\ncrop may be cultivated. The stalks after being cut are put in shocks\r\nuntil they are dry. Then the seeds are threshed. Large amounts of hemp\r\nseed are sold for caged birds and for poultry; it is also used for\r\npaint-oils.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLVII. BUCKWHEAT\r\n\r\nBuckwheat shares with rye and cowpeas the power to make a fairly good\r\ncrop on poor land. At the same time, of course, a full crop can be\r\nexpected only from fertile land.\r\n\r\nThe three varieties most grown in America are the common gray, the\r\nsilver-hull, and the Japanese. The seeds of the common gray are larger\r\nthan the silver-hull, but not so large as the Japanese. The seeds from\r\nthe gray variety are generally regarded as inferior to the other two.\r\nThis crop is grown to best advantage in climates where the nights are\r\ncool and moist. It matures more quickly than any other grain crop and is\r\nremarkably free from disease. The yield varies from ten to forty bushels\r\nan acre. Buckwheat does not seem to draw plant food heavily from the\r\nsoil and can be grown on the same land from year to year.\r\n\r\nIn fertilizing buckwheat land, green manures and rich nitrogenous\r\nfertilizers should be avoided. These cause such a luxuriant growth that\r\nthe stalks lodge badly.\r\n\r\nThe time of seeding will have to be settled by the height of the land\r\nand by the climate. In northern climates and in high altitudes the\r\nseeding is generally done in May or June. In southern climates and in\r\nlow altitudes the planting may wait until July or August. The plant\r\nusually matures in about seventy days. It cannot stand warm weather at\r\nblooming-time, and must always be planted so that it may escape warm\r\nweather in its blooming period and cold weather in its maturing season.\r\nThe seeds are commonly broadcasted at an average rate of four pecks to\r\nthe acre. If the land is loose and pulverized, it should be rolled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 220. BUCKWHEAT IN SHOCK]\r\n\r\nBuckwheat ripens unevenly and will continue to bloom until frost.\r\nHarvesting usually begins just after the first crop of seeds have\r\nmatured. To keep the grains from shattering, the harvesting is best done\r\nduring damp or cloudy days or early in the morning while the dew is\r\nstill on the grain. The grain should be threshed as soon as it is dry\r\nenough to go through the thresher.\r\n\r\nBuckwheat is grown largely for table use. The grain is crushed into a\r\ndark flour that makes most palatable breakfast cakes. The grain,\r\nespecially when mixed with corn, is becoming popular for poultry food.\r\nThe middlings, which are rich in fats and protein, are prized for dairy\r\ncows.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLVIII. RICE\r\n\r\nThe United States produces only about one half of the rice that it\r\nconsumes. There is no satisfactory reason for our not raising more of\r\nthis staple crop, for five great states along the Gulf of Mexico are\r\nwell adapted to its culture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 221. THRESHING RICE]\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct kinds of rice, upland rice and lowland rice.\r\nUpland rice demands in general the same methods of culture that are\r\nrequired by other cereals, for example, oats or wheat. The growing of\r\nlowland rice is considerably more difficult and includes the necessity\r\nof flooding the fields with water at proper times.\r\n\r\nA stiff, half-clay soil with some loam is best suited to this crop. The\r\nsoil should have a clay subsoil to retain water and to give stiffness\r\nenough to allow the use of harvesting-machinery. Some good rice soils\r\nare so stiff that they must be flooded to soften them enough to admit of\r\nplowing. Plow deeply to give the roots ample feeding-space. Good\r\ntillage, which is too often neglected, is valuable.\r\n\r\nCareful seed-selection is perhaps even more needed for rice than for any\r\nother crop. Consumers want kernels of the same size. Be sure that your\r\nseed is free from red rice and other weeds. Drilling is much better\r\nthan broadcasting, as it secures a more even distribution of the seed.\r\n\r\nThe notion generally prevails that flooding returns to the soil the\r\nneeded fertility. This may be true if the flooding-water deposits much\r\nsilt, but if the water be clear it is untrue, and fertilizers or\r\nleguminous crops are needed to keep up fertility. Cowpeas replace the\r\nlost soil-elements and keep down weeds, grasses, and red rice.\r\n\r\nRed rice is a weed close kin to rice, but the seed of one will not\r\nproduce the other. Do not allow it to get mixed and sowed with your rice\r\nseed or to go to seed in your field.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLIX. THE TIMBER CROP\r\n\r\nForest trees are not usually regarded as a crop, but they are certainly\r\none of the most important crops. We should accustom ourselves to look on\r\nour trees as needing and as deserving the same care and thought that we\r\ngive to our other field crops. The total number of acres given to the\r\ngrowth of forest trees is still enormous, but we should each year add to\r\nthis acreage.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately very few forests are so managed as to add yearly to their\r\nvalue and to preserve a model stand of trees. Axmen generally fell the\r\ngreat trees without thought of the young trees that should at once begin\r\nto fill the places left vacant by the fallen giants. Owners rarely study\r\ntheir woodlands to be sure that the trees are thick enough, or to find\r\nout whether the saplings are ruinously crowding one another. Disease is\r\noften allowed to slip in unchecked. Old trees stand long after they have\r\noutlived their usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe farm wood-lot, too, is often neglected. As forests are being swept\r\naway, fuel is of course becoming scarcer and more costly. Every farmer\r\nought to plant trees enough on his waste land to make sure of a constant\r\nsupply of fuel. The land saved for the wood-lot should be selected from\r\nland unfit for cultivation. Steep hillsides, rocky slopes, ravines,\r\nbanks of streams--these can, without much expense or labor, be set in\r\ntrees and insure a never-ending fuel supply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 222. WOOD LOT\r\nBefore proper treatment]\r\n\r\nThe most common enemies of the forest crop are:\r\n\r\nFirst, forest fires. The waste from forest fires in the United States is\r\nmost startling. Many of these fires are the result of carelessness or\r\nignorance. Most of the states have made or are now making laws to\r\nprevent and to control such fires.\r\n\r\nSecond, fungous diseases. The timber loss from these diseases is\r\nexceedingly great.\r\n\r\nThird, insects of many kinds prey on the trees. Some strip all the\r\nleaves from the branches. Others bore into the roots, trunk, or\r\nbranches. Some lead to a slow death; others are more quickly fatal.\r\n\r\nFourth, improper grazing. Turning animals into young woods may lead to\r\nserious loss. The animals frequently ruin young trees by eating all the\r\nfoliage. Hogs often unearth and consume most of the seeds needed for a\r\ngood growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 223. WOOD LOT\r\nAfter proper treatment]\r\n\r\nThe handling of forests is a business just as the growing of corn is a\r\nbusiness. In old forests, dead and dying trees should be cut. Trees that\r\noccupy space and yet have little commercial value should give way to\r\nmore valuable trees. A quick-growing tree, if it is equally desirable,\r\nshould be preferred to a slow grower. An even distribution of the trees\r\nshould be secured.\r\n\r\nIn all there are about five hundred species of trees which are natives\r\nof the United States. Probably not over seventy of these are desirable\r\nfor forests. In selecting trees to plant or to allow to grow from their\r\nown seeding, pick those that make a quick growth, that have a steady\r\nmarket value, and that suit the soil, the place of growth, and the\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION L. THE FARM GARDEN\r\n\r\nEvery farmer needs a garden in which to grow not only vegetables but\r\nsmall fruits for the home table.\r\n\r\nThe garden should always be within convenient distance of the farmhouse.\r\nIf possible, the spot selected should have a soil of mixed loam and\r\nclay. Every foot of soil in the garden should be made rich and mellow by\r\nmanure and cultivation. The worst soils for the home garden are light,\r\nsandy soils, or stiff, clayey soils; but any soil, by judicious and\r\nintelligent culture, can be made suitable.\r\n\r\nIn laying out the garden we should bear in mind that hand labor is the\r\nmost expensive kind of labor. Hence we should not, as is commonly done,\r\nlay off the garden spot in the form of a square, but we should mark off\r\nfor our purpose a long, narrow piece of land, so that the cultivating\r\ntools may all be conveniently drawn by a horse or a mule. The use of the\r\nplow and the horse cultivator enables the cultivation of the garden to\r\nbe done quickly, easily, and cheaply.\r\n\r\nEach vegetable or fruit should be planted in rows, and not in little\r\npatches. Beginning with one side of the garden the following plan of\r\narrangement is simple and complete: two rows to corn for table use; two\r\nto cabbages, beets, radishes, and eggplants; two to onions, peas, and\r\nbeans; two to oyster-plants, okra, parsley, and turnips; two to\r\ntomatoes; then four on the other side can be used for strawberries,\r\nblackberries, raspberries, currants, and gooseberries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 224. WHERE DELICIOUS GARDEN VEGETABLES GROW]\r\n\r\nThe garden, when so arranged, can be tilled in the spring and tended\r\nthroughout the growing season with little labor and little loss of time.\r\nIn return for this odd-hour work, the farmer's family will have\r\nthroughout the year an abundance of fresh, palatable, and health-giving\r\nvegetables and small fruits.\r\n\r\nThe keynote of successful gardening is to stir the soil. Stir it often\r\nwith four objects in view:\r\n\r\n  1. To destroy weeds.\r\n\r\n  2. To let air enter the soil.\r\n\r\n  3. To enrich the soil by the action of the air.\r\n\r\n  4. To retain the moisture by preventing its evaporation.\r\n\r\n                    corn\r\n                    corn\r\n\r\n  cabbage           beets              radishes\r\n  cabbage           beets              eggplants\r\n\r\n  onions            peas             beans\r\n  onions            peas             beans\r\n\r\n  oyster-plants   okra        parsley        parsnips\r\n  oyster-plants   okra        parsley        parsnips\r\n\r\n                        tomatoes\r\n                        tomatoes\r\n\r\n  strawberries    currants    raspberries    blackberries\r\n  strawberries    currants    raspberries    blackberries\r\n  strawberries    currants    raspberries    blackberries\r\n  strawberries    currants    raspberries    blackberries\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 225. HOW TO LAY OUT THE GARDEN[1]]\r\n\r\nThis illustration shows that practically every garden vegetable and all\r\nthe small fruits can be included in the farm garden, and all the work be\r\ndone by horse-drawn tools.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The number of rows and arrangement of the vegetables in the\r\noutline above are merely suggestive. They should be changed to meet the\r\nneeds and the tastes of each particular family.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFEED STUFFS\r\n\r\nSECTION LI. GRASSES\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder usual conditions no farmer expects to grow live stock successfully\r\nand economically without setting apart a large part of his land for the\r\ngrowth of mowing and pasture crops. Therefore to the grower of stock the\r\nmanagement of grass crops is all-important.\r\n\r\nIn planting either for a meadow or for a pasture, the farmer should mix\r\ndifferent varieties of grass seeds. Nature mixes them when she plants,\r\nand Nature is always a trustworthy teacher.\r\n\r\nIn planting for a pasture the aim should be to sow such seeds as will\r\ngive green grass from early spring to latest fall. In seeding for a\r\nmeadow such varieties should be sowed together as ripen about the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nEven in those sections of the country where it grows sparingly and where\r\nit is easily crowded out, clover should be mixed with all grasses sowed,\r\nfor it leaves in the soil a wealth of plant food for the grasses coming\r\nafter it to feed on. Nearly every part of our country has some clover\r\nthat experience shows to be exactly suited to its soil and climate.\r\nStudy these clovers carefully and mix them with your grass seed.\r\n\r\nThe reason for mixing clover and grass is at once seen. The true\r\ngrasses, so far as science now shows, get all their nitrogen from the\r\nsoil; hence they more or less exhaust the soil. But, as several times\r\nexplained in this book, the clovers are legumes, and all legumes are\r\nable by means of the bacteria that live on their roots to use the free\r\nnitrogen of the air. Hence without cost to the farmer these clovers help\r\nthe soil to feed their neighbors, the true grasses. For this reason some\r\nlight perennial legume should always be added to grass seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 226. SINGLE PLANT OF GIANT MILLET]\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for grasses to do well in a soil that is full of\r\nweeds. For this reason it is always best to sow grass in fields from\r\nwhich cultivated crops have just been taken. Soil which is to have grass\r\nsowed in it should have its particles pressed together. The small grass\r\nseeds cannot take root and grow well in land that has just been plowed\r\nand which, consequently, has its particles loose and comparatively far\r\napart. On the other hand, land from which a crop of corn or cotton has\r\njust been harvested is in a compact condition. The soil particles are\r\npressed well together. Such land when mellowed by harrowing makes a\r\nsplendid bed for grass seeds. A firm soil draws moisture up to the\r\nseeds, while a mellow soil acts as a blanket to keep moisture from\r\nwasting into the air, and at the same time allows the heated air to\r\ncirculate in the soil.\r\n\r\nIn case land has to be plowed for grass-seeding, the plowing should be\r\ndone as far as possible in advance of the seeding. Then the plowed land\r\nshould be harrowed several times to get the land in a soft, mellow\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nIf the seed-bed be carefully prepared, little work on the ground is\r\nnecessary after the seeds are sowed. One light harrowing is sufficient\r\nto cover the broadcast seeds. This harrowing should always be done as\r\nsoon as the seeds are scattered, for if there be moisture in the soil\r\nthe tiny seeds will soon sprout, and if the harrowing be done after\r\ngermination is somewhat advanced, the tender grass plants will be\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of pasture and meadow grasses. In New England,\r\ntimothy, red clover, and redtop are generally used for the mowing crop.\r\nFor permanent pasture, in addition to those mentioned, there should be\r\nadded white clover and either Kentucky or Canadian blue grass. In the\r\nSouthern states a good meadow or pasture can be made of orchard grass,\r\nred clover, and redtop. For a permanent pasture in the South, Japan\r\nclover, Bermuda, and such other local grasses as have been found to\r\nadapt themselves readily to the climate should be added. In the Middle\r\nStates temporary meadows and pastures are generally made of timothy and\r\nred clover, while for permanent pastures white clover and blue grass\r\nthrive well. In the more western states the grasses previously suggested\r\nare readily at home. Alfalfa is proving its adaptability to nearly all\r\nsections and climates, and is in many respects the most promising grass\r\ncrop of America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 227. BERMUDA]\r\n\r\nIt hardly ever pays to pasture meadows, except slightly, the first\r\nseason, and then only when the soil is dry. It is also poor policy to\r\npasture any kind of grass land early in the spring when the soil is wet,\r\nbecause the tramping of animals crushes and destroys the crowns of the\r\nplants. After the first year the sward becomes thicker and tougher, and\r\nthe grass is not at all injured if it is grazed wisely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 228. ALFALFA THE WONDERFUL\r\nThe first crop of the season is being cut and stored for winter]\r\n\r\nThe state of maturity at which grass should be harvested to make hay of\r\nthe best quality varies somewhat with the different grasses and with the\r\nuse which is to be made of the hay. Generally speaking, it is a good\r\nrule to cut grass for hay just as it is beginning to bloom or just after\r\nthe bloom has fallen. All grasses become less palatable to stock as they\r\nmature and form seed. If grass be allowed to go to seed, most of the\r\nnutrition in the stalk is used to form the seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 229. HARVESTING ALFALFA]\r\n\r\nHence a good deal of food is lost by waiting to cut hay until the seeds\r\nare formed.\r\n\r\nPasture lands and meadow lands are often greatly improved by replowing\r\nand harrowing in order to break up the turf that forms and to admit air\r\nmore freely into the soil. The plant-roots that are destroyed by the\r\nplowing or harrowing make quickly available plant food by their decay,\r\nand the physical improvement of the soil leads to a thicker and better\r\nstand. In the older sections of the country commercial fertilizer can be\r\nused to advantage in producing hay and pasturage. If, however, clover\r\nhas just been grown on grass land or if it is growing well with the\r\ngrass, there is no need to add nitrogen. If the grass seems to lack\r\nsufficient nourishment, add phosphoric acid and potash. However, grass\r\nnot grown in company with clover often needs dried blood, nitrate of\r\nsoda, or some other nitrogen-supplying agent. Of course it is understood\r\nthat no better fertilizer can be applied to grass than barnyard manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LII. LEGUMES\r\n\r\nOften land which was once thought excellent is left to grow up in weeds.\r\nThe owner says that the land is worn out, and that it will not pay to\r\nplant it. What does \"worn out\" mean? Simply that constant cropping has\r\nused up the plant food in the land. Therefore, plants on worn-out land\r\nare too nearly starved to yield bountifully. Such wearing out is so\r\neasily prevented that no owner ought ever to allow his land to become\r\npoverty-stricken. But in case this misfortune has happened, how can the\r\nland be again made fertile?\r\n\r\nOn page 24 you learned that phosphoric acid, potash, and nitrogen are\r\nthe foods most needed by plants. \"Worn out,\" then, to put it in\r\nanother way, usually means that a soil has been robbed of one of these\r\nplant necessities, or of two or of all three. To make the land once more\r\nfruitful it is necessary to restore the missing food or foods. How can\r\nthis be done? Two of these plant foods, namely, phosphoric acid and\r\npotash, are minerals. If either of these is lacking, it can be supplied\r\nonly by putting on the land some fertilizer containing the missing food.\r\nFortunately, however, nitrogen, the most costly of the plant foods, can\r\nbe readily and cheaply returned to poor land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 230. ALFALFA READY FOR THE THIRD CUTTING]\r\n\r\nAs explained on page 32 the leguminous crops have the power of drawing\r\nnitrogen from the air and, by means of their root-tubercles, of storing\r\nit in the soil. Hence by growing these crops on poor land the expensive\r\nnitrogen is quickly restored to the soil, and only the two cheaper plant\r\nfoods need be bought. How important it is then to grow these leguminous\r\nplants! Every farmer should so rotate his planting that at least once\r\nevery two or three years a crop of legumes may add to the fruitfulness\r\nof his fields.\r\n\r\nMoreover these crops help land in another way. They send a multitude of\r\nroots deep into the ground. These roots loosen and pulverize the soil,\r\nand their decay, at the end of the growing season, leaves much humus in\r\nthe soil. Land will rarely become worn out if legumes are regularly and\r\nwisely grown.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that they do well in so many different sections and in so\r\nmany different climates, the following are the most useful legumes:\r\nalfalfa, clovers, cowpeas, vetches, and soy beans.\r\n\r\n=Alfalfa.= Alfalfa is primarily a hay crop. It thrives in the Far West,\r\nin the Middle West, in the North, and in the South. In fact, it will do\r\nwell wherever the soil is rich, moist, deep, and underlaid by an open\r\nsubsoil. The vast areas given to this valuable crop are yearly\r\nincreasing in every section of the United States. Alfalfa, however,\r\nunlike the cowpea, does not take to poor land. For its cultivation,\r\ntherefore, good fertile land that is moist but not water-soaked should\r\nbe selected.\r\n\r\nGood farmers are partial to alfalfa for three reasons. First, it yields\r\na heavy crop of forage or hay. Second, being a legume, it improves the\r\nsoil. Third, one seeding lasts a long time. This length of life may,\r\nhowever, be destroyed by pasturing or abusing the alfalfa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 231. SHEEP FATTENING ON ALFALFA STUBBLE]\r\n\r\nAlfalfa is different from most plants in this respect: the soil in which\r\nit grows must have certain kinds of bacteria in it. These cause the\r\ngrowth of tubercles on the roots. These bacteria, however, are not\r\nalways present in land that has not been planted in alfalfa. Hence if\r\nthis plant is to be grown successfully these helpful bacteria must\r\nsometimes be supplied artificially.\r\n\r\nThere are two very easy ways of supplying the germs. First, fine soil\r\nfrom an alfalfa field may be scattered broadcast over the fields to be\r\nseeded. Second, a small mass of alfalfa tubercle germs may be put into a\r\nliquid containing proper food to make these germs multiply and grow;\r\nthen the seeds to be planted are soaked in this liquid in order that\r\nthe germs may fasten on the seeds.\r\n\r\nBefore the seeds are sowed the soil should be mellowed. Over this\r\nwell-prepared land about twenty pounds of seed to the acre should be\r\nscattered. The seed may be scattered by hand or by a seed-sower. Cover\r\nwith a light harrow. The time of planting varies somewhat with the\r\nclimate. Except where the winters are too severe the seed may be sowed\r\neither in the spring or in the fall. In the South sow only in the fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 232. HERD OF DAIRY CATTLE GRAZING ON ALFALFA STUBBLE]\r\n\r\nDuring the first season one mowing, perhaps more, is necessary to insure\r\na good stand and also to keep down the weeds. When the first blossoms\r\nappear in the early summer, it is time to start the mower. After this\r\nthe alfalfa should be cut every two, three, or four weeks. The number of\r\ntimes depends on the rapidity of growth.\r\n\r\nThis crop rarely makes a good yield the first year, but if a good stand\r\nbe secured, the yield steadily increases. After a good stand has been\r\nsecured, a top-dressing of either commercial fertilizer or stable manure\r\nwill be very helpful. An occasional cutting-up of the sod with a disk\r\nharrow does much good.\r\n\r\n=Clovers.= The different kinds of clovers will sometimes grow on hard or\r\npoor soil, but they do far better if the soil is enriched and properly\r\nprepared before the seed is sowed. In many parts of our country it has\r\nbeen the practice for generations to sow clover seed with some of the\r\ngrain crops. Barley, wheat, oats, and rye are the crops with which\r\nclover is usually planted, but many good farmers now prefer to sow the\r\nseed only with other grass seed. Circumstances must largely determine\r\nthe manner of seeding.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover, which is a winter legume, usually does best when seeded\r\nalone, although rye or some other grain often seems helpful to it. This\r\nkind of clover is an excellent crop with which to follow cotton or corn.\r\nIt is most conveniently sowed at the last cultivation of these crops.\r\n\r\nCommon red clover, which is the standard clover over most of the\r\ncountry, is usually seeded with timothy or with orchard grass or with\r\nsome other of the grasses. In sowing both crimson and red clover, about\r\nten to fifteen pounds of seed for each acre are generally used.\r\n\r\nTo make good pastures, white and Japan clover are favorites. White\r\nclover does well in most parts of America, and Japan clover is\r\nespecially valuable in warm Southern climates. Both will do well even\r\nwhen the soil is partly shaded, but they do best in land fully open to\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nCareful attention is required to cure clover hay well. The clover should\r\nalways be cut before it forms seed. The best time to cut is when the\r\nplants are in full bloom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 233. CRIMSON CLOVER]\r\n\r\nLet the mower be started in the morning. Then a few hours later run over\r\nthe field with the tedder. This will loosen the hay and let in air and\r\nsunshine. If the weather be fair let the hay lie until the next day, and\r\nthen rake it into rows for further drying. After being raked, the hay\r\nmay either be left in the rows for final curing or it may be put in\r\ncocks. If the weather be unsettled, it is best to cock the hay. Many\r\nfarmers have cloth covers to protect the cocks and these often aid\r\ngreatly in saving the hay crop in a rainy season. In case the hay is put\r\nin cocks, it should be opened for a final drying before it is housed.\r\n\r\n=Cowpeas.= The cowpea is an excellent soil-enricher. It supplies more\r\nfertilizing material to turn into the soil, in a short time and at small\r\ncost, than any other crop. Moreover, by good tillage and by the use of a\r\nvery small amount of fertilizer, the cowpea can be grown on land too\r\npoor to produce any other crop. Its roots go deep into the soil. Hence\r\nthey gather plant food and moisture that shallow-rooted plants fail to\r\nreach. These qualities make it an invaluable help in bringing worn-out\r\nlands back to fertility.\r\n\r\nThe cowpea is a warm-weather legume. In the United States it succeeds\r\nbest in the south and southwest. It has, however, in recent years been\r\ngrown as far north as Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Michigan, and\r\nMinnesota, but in these cold climates other legumes are more useful.\r\nCowpeas should never be planted until all danger of frost is past. Some\r\nvarieties make their full growth in two months; others need four months.\r\n\r\nThere are about two hundred varieties of cowpeas. These varieties differ\r\nin form, in the size of seed and of pod, in the color of seed and of\r\npod, and in the time of ripening. They differ, too, in the manner of\r\ngrowth. Some grow erect; others sprawl on the ground. In selecting\r\nvarieties it is well to choose those that grow straight up, those that\r\nare hardy, those that fruit early and abundantly, and those that hold\r\ntheir leaves. The variety selected for seed should also suit the land\r\nand the climate.\r\n\r\nThe cowpea will grow in almost any soil. It thrives best and yields most\r\nbountifully on well-drained sandy loams. The plant also does well on\r\nclay soils. On light, sandy soils a fairly good crop may be made, but on\r\nsuch soils, wilt and root-knot are dangerous foes. A warm, moist,\r\nwell-pulverized seed-bed should always be provided. Few plants equal the\r\ncowpea in repaying careful preparation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 234. COWPEAS]\r\n\r\nIf this crop is grown for hay, the method of seeding and cultivating\r\nwill differ somewhat from the method used when a seed crop is desired.\r\nWhen cowpeas are planted for hay the seeds should be drilled or\r\nbroadcasted. If the seeds are small and the land somewhat rich, about\r\nfour pecks should be sowed on each acre. If the seeds are comparatively\r\nlarge and the soil not so fertile, about six pecks should be sowed to\r\nthe acre. It is safer to disk in the seeds when they are sowed broadcast\r\nthan it is to rely on a harrow to cover them. In sowing merely for a\r\nhay crop, it is a good practice to mix sorghum, corn, soy beans, or\r\nmillet with the cowpeas. The mixed hay is more easily harvested and more\r\neasily cured than unmixed cowpea hay. Shortly after seeding, it pays to\r\nrun over the land lightly with a harrow or a weeder in order to break\r\nany crust that may form.\r\n\r\nMowing should begin as soon as the stalks and the pods have finished\r\ngrowing and some of the lower leaves have begun to turn yellow. An\r\nordinary mower is perhaps the best machine for cutting the vines. If\r\npossible, select only a bright day for mowing and do not start the\r\nmachine until the dew on the vines is dried. Allow the vines to remain\r\nas they fell from the mower till they are wilted; then rake them into\r\nwindrows. The vines should generally stay in the windrows for two or\r\nthree days and be turned on the last day. They should then be put in\r\nsmall, airy piles or piled around a stake that has crosspieces nailed to\r\nit. The drying vines should never be packed; air must circulate freely\r\nif good hay is to be made. As piling the vines around stakes is somewhat\r\nlaborious, some growers watch the curing carefully and succeed in\r\ngetting the vines dry enough to haul directly from the windrows to the\r\nbarns. Never allow the vines to stay exposed to too much sunshine when\r\nthey are first cut. If the sun strikes them too strongly, the leaves\r\nwill become brittle and shatter when they are moved.\r\n\r\nWhen cowpeas are grown for their pods to ripen, the seeds should be\r\nplanted in rows about a yard apart. From two to three pecks of seeds to\r\nan acre should be sufficient. The growing plants should be cultivated\r\ntwo or three times with a good cultivator. Cowpeas were formerly\r\ngathered by hand, but such a method is of course slow and expensive.\r\nPickers are now commonly used.\r\n\r\nSome farmers use the cowpea crop only as a soil-enricher. Hence they\r\nneither gather the seeds nor cut the hay, but plow the whole crop into\r\nthe soil. There is an average of about forty-seven pounds of nitrogen in\r\neach ton of cowpea vines. Most of this valuable nitrogen is drawn by the\r\nplants from the air. This amount of nitrogen is equal to that contained\r\nin 9500 pounds of stable manure. In addition each ton of cowpea vines\r\ncontains ten pounds of phosphoric acid and twenty-nine pounds of potash.\r\n\r\nThere is danger in plowing into the soil at one time any bountiful green\r\ncrop like cowpeas. As already explained on page 10, a process\r\ncalled capillarity enables moisture to rise in the soil as plants need\r\nit. Now if a heavy cowpea crop or any other similar crop be at one\r\nplowing turned into the soil, the soil particles will be so separated as\r\nto destroy capillarity. Too much vegetation turned under at once may\r\nalso, if the weather be warm, cause fermentation to set in and \"sour the\r\nland.\" Both of these troubles may be avoided by cutting up the vines\r\nwith a disk harrow or other implement before covering them.\r\n\r\nThe custom of planting cowpeas between the rows at the last working of\r\ncorn is a good one, and wherever the climate permits this custom should\r\nbe followed.\r\n\r\n=Vetches.= The vetches have been rapidly growing in favor for some\r\nyears. Stock eat vetch hay greedily, and this hay increases the flow of\r\nmilk in dairy animals and helps to keep animals fat and sleek. Only two\r\nspecies of vetch are widely grown. These are the tare, or spring vetch,\r\nand the winter, or hairy, vetch. Spring vetch is grown in comparatively\r\nfew sections of our country. It is, however, grown widely in England and\r\nnorthern continental Europe. What we say here will be confined to hairy\r\nvetch.\r\n\r\nAfter a soil has been supplied with the germs needed by this plant, the\r\nhairy vetch is productive on many different kinds of soil. The plant is\r\nmost vigorous on fertile loams. By good tillage and proper fertilization\r\nit may be forced to grow rather bountifully on poor sandy and clay\r\nloams. Acid or wet soils are not suited to vetch. Lands that are too\r\npoor to produce clovers will frequently yield fair crops of vetch. If\r\nthis is borne in mind, many poor soils may be wonderfully improved by\r\ngrowing on them this valuable legume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 235. VETCH]\r\n\r\nVetch needs a fine well-compacted seed-bed, but it is often sowed with\r\ngood results on stubble lands and between cotton and corn rows, where it\r\nis covered by a cultivator or a weeder.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the vetch are costly and are brought chiefly from Germany,\r\nwhere this crop is much prized. The pods ripen so irregularly that they\r\nhave to be picked by hand.\r\n\r\nIn northern climates early spring sowing is found most satisfactory. In\r\nsouthern climates the seeding is best done in the late summer or early\r\nfall. As the vetch vines have a tendency to trail on the ground, it is\r\nwisest to plant with the vetch some crop like oats, barley, rye, or\r\nwheat. These plants will support the vetch and keep its vines from being\r\ninjured by falling on the ground. Do not use rye with vetch in the\r\nSouth. It ripens too early to be of much assistance. If sowed with oats\r\nthe seeding should be at the rate of about twenty or thirty pounds of\r\nvetch and about one and a half or two bushels of oats to the acre. Vetch\r\nis covered in the same way as wheat and rye.\r\n\r\nFew crops enrich soil more rapidly than vetch if the whole plant is\r\nturned in. It of course adds nitrogen to the soil and at the same time\r\nsupplies the soil with a large amount of organic matter to decay and\r\nchange to humus. As the crop grows during the winter, it makes an\r\nexcellent cover to prevent washing. Many orchard-growers of the\r\nNorthwest find vetch the best winter crop for the orchards as well as\r\nfor the fields.\r\n\r\n=Soy, or Soja, Bean.= In China and Japan the soy bean is grown largely\r\nas food for man. In the United States it is used as a forage plant and\r\nas a soil-improver. It bids fair to become one of the most popular of\r\nthe legumes. Like the cowpea, this bean is at home only in a warm\r\nclimate. Some of the early-ripening varieties have, however, been\r\nplanted with fair success in cold climates.\r\n\r\nWhile there are a large number of varieties of the soy bean, only about\r\na dozen are commonly grown. They differ mainly in the color, size, and\r\nshape of the seeds, and in the time needed for ripening. Some of the\r\nvarieties are more hairy than others.\r\n\r\nSoy beans may take many places in good crop-rotations, but they are\r\nunusually valuable in short rotations with small grains. The grains can\r\nbe cut in time for the beans to follow them, and in turn the beans can\r\nbe harvested in the early fall and make way for another grain crop.\r\n\r\nIt should always be remembered that soy beans will not thrive unless the\r\nland on which they are to grow is already supplied, or is supplied at\r\nthe time of sowing, with bean bacteria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 236. CHINESE SOY BEANS]\r\n\r\nThe plant will grow on many different kinds of soil, but it needs a\r\nricher soil than the cowpea does. As the crop can gather most of its own\r\nnitrogen, it generally requires only the addition of phosphoric acid and\r\npotash for its growth on poor land. When the first crop is seeded, apply\r\nto each acre four hundred pounds of a fertilizing mixture which contains\r\nabout ten per cent of phosphoric acid, four per cent of potash, and from\r\none to two per cent of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nIf the crop is planted for hay or for grazing, mellow the ground well,\r\nand then broadcast or drill in closely about one and a half bushels of\r\nseed to each acre. Cover from one to two inches deep, but never allow a\r\ncrust to form over the seed, for the plant cannot break through a crust\r\nwell. When the beans are planted for seeds, a half bushel of seed to the\r\nacre is usually sufficient. The plants should stand in the rows from\r\nfour to six inches apart, and the rows should be from thirty to forty\r\ninches from one another. Never plant until the sun has thoroughly warmed\r\nthe land. The bean may be sowed, however, earlier than cowpeas. A most\r\nconvenient time is just after corn is planted. The rows should be\r\ncultivated often enough to keep out weeds and grass and to keep a good\r\ndust mulch, but the cultivation must be shallow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 237. SOY BEANS]\r\n\r\nAs soy beans are grown for hay and also for seed, the harvesting will,\r\nas with the other legumes, be controlled by the purpose for which the\r\ncrop was planted. In harvesting for a hay crop it is desirable to cut\r\nthe beans after the pods are well formed but before they are fully\r\ngrown. If the cutting is delayed until the pods are ripe, the fruit will\r\nshatter badly. There is a loss, too, in the food value of the stems if\r\nthe cutting is late. The ordinary mowing-machine with a rake attached is\r\ngenerally the machine used for cutting the stalks. The leaves should be\r\nmost carefully preserved, for they contain much nourishment for stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 238. SOY BEANS IN CORN]\r\n\r\nWhenever the beans are grown for seeds, harvesting should begin when\r\nthree fourths of the leaves have fallen and most of the pods are ripe.\r\nDo not wait, however, until the pods are so dry that they have begun to\r\nsplit and drop their seeds. A slight amount of dampness on the plants\r\naids the cutting. The threshing may be done with a flail, with\r\npea-hullers, or with a grain-threshing machine.\r\n\r\nThe beans produce more seed to the acre than cowpeas do. Forty bushels\r\nis a high yield. The average yield is between twenty and thirty bushels.\r\n\r\n                      DESCRIPTIVE TABLE\r\n\r\n                ADAPTATION AS\r\nCrop            FOOD FOR ANIMALS     LIFE            REMARKS\r\n\r\nAlfalfa         Hay                Perennial   All animals like it; hogs\r\n                                                eat it even when it is dry.\r\nRed clover      Hay and pasture    Perennial   Best of the clovers for hay.\r\nAlsike clover   Hay and pasture    Perennial   Seeds itself for twenty\r\n                                                years.

The general rule is, poor\r\nstock, poor people. All the prosperous nations of the globe, especially\r\nthe grain-growing nations, get a large share of their wealth from\r\nraising improved stock. The stock bred by these nations is now, however,\r\nvery different from the stock raised by the same nations years ago. As\r\nsoon as man began to progress in the art of agriculture he became\r\ndissatisfied with inferior stock. He therefore bent his energies to\r\nraise the standard of excellence in domestic animals.\r\n\r\nBy slow stages of animal improvement the ugly, thin-flanked wild boar of\r\nearly times has been transformed into the sleek Berkshire or the\r\nwell-rounded Poland-China. In the same manner the wild sheep of the Old\r\nWorld have been developed into wool and mutton breeds of the finest\r\nexcellence. By constant care, attention, and selection the thin,\r\nlong-legged wild ox has been bred into the bounteous milk-producing\r\nJerseys and Holsteins or into the Shorthorn mountains of flesh. From the\r\nsmall, bony, coarse, and shaggy horse of ancient times have descended\r\nthe heavy Norman, or Percheron, draft horse and the fleet Arab courser.\r\n\r\nThe matter of meat-production is one of vital importance to the human\r\nrace, for animal food must always supply a large part of man's ration.\r\n\r\nLive stock of various kinds consume the coarser foods, like the grasses,\r\nhays, and grains, which man cannot use. As a result of this consumption\r\nthey store in their bodies the exact substances required for building up\r\nthe tissues of man's body.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal is used by man for food, one class of foods stored away\r\nin the animal's body produces muscle; another produces fat, heat, and\r\nenergy. The food furnished by the slaughter of animals seems necessary\r\nto the full development of man. It is true that the flesh of an animal\r\nwill not support human life so long as would the grain that the animal\r\nate while growing, but it is also true that animal food does not require\r\nso much of man's force to digest it. Hence the use of meat forces a part\r\nof man's life-struggle on the lower animal.\r\n\r\nWhen men feed grain to stock, the animals receive in return power and\r\nfood in their most available forms. Men strengthen the animal that they\r\nthemselves may be strengthened. One of the great questions, then, for\r\nthe stock-grower's consideration is how to make the least amount of food\r\nfed to animals produce the most power and flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LIII. HORSES\r\n\r\nWhile we have a great many kinds of horses in America, horses are not\r\nnatives of this country. Just where wild horses were first tamed and\r\nused is not certainly known. It is believed that in early ages the horse\r\nwas a much smaller animal than it now is, and that it gradually attained\r\nits present size. Where food was abundant and nutritious and the climate\r\nmild and healthful, the early horses developed large frames and heavy\r\nlimbs and muscles; on the other hand, where food was scarce and the\r\nclimate cold and bleak, the animals remained as dwarfed as the ponies of\r\nthe Shetland Islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 239. THE FAMILY PET]\r\n\r\nOne of the first records concerning the horse is found in Genesis xlix,\r\n17, where Jacob speaks of \"an adder that biteth the horse heels.\"\r\nPharaoh took \"six hundred chosen chariots\" and \"with all the horses and\r\nchariots\" pursued the Israelites. The Greeks at first drove the horse\r\nfastened to a rude chariot; later they rode on its back, learning to\r\nmanage the animal with voice or switch and without either saddle or\r\nbridle. This thinking people soon invented the snaffle bit, and both\r\nrode and drove with its aid. The curb bit was a Roman invention. Shoeing\r\nwas not practiced by either Greeks or Romans. Saddles and harnesses were\r\nat first made of skins and sometimes of cloth.\r\n\r\nAmong the Tartars of middle and northern Asia and also among some other\r\nnations, mare's milk and the flesh of the horse are used for food. Old\r\nand otherwise worthless horses are regularly fattened for the meat\r\nmarkets of France and Germany. Various uses are made of the different\r\nparts of a horse's body. The mane and tail are used in the manufacture\r\nof mattresses, and also furnish a haircloth for upholstering; the skin\r\nis tanned into leather; the hoofs are used for glue, and the bones for\r\nmaking fertilizer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 240. PERCHERON HORSE (A DRAFT TYPE)]\r\n\r\nClimate, food, and natural surroundings have all aided in producing\r\nchanges in the horse's form, size, and appearance. The varying\r\ncircumstances under which horses have been raised have given rise to the\r\ndifferent breeds. In addition, the masters' needs had much to do in\r\ndeveloping the type of horses wanted. Some masters desired work horses,\r\nand kept the heavy, muscular, stout-limbed animals; others desired\r\nriding and driving horses, so they saved for their use the light-limbed,\r\nangular horses that had endurance and mettle. The following table gives\r\nsome of the different breeds and the places of their development:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 241.\r\nDiagram shows the proper shape of the fore and hind legs of a horse.\r\nWhen the straight lines divide the legs equally, the leg action is\r\nstraight and regular]\r\n\r\n  I. _Draft, or Heavy, Breeds_\r\n\r\n  1. Percheron, from the province of Perche, France.\r\n  2. French Draft, developed in France.\r\n  3. Belgian Draft, developed by Belgian farmers.\r\n  4. Clydesdale, the draft horse of Scotland.\r\n  5. Suffolk Punch, from the eastern part of England.\r\n  6. English Shire, also from the eastern part of England.\r\n\r\n  II. _Carriage, or Coach, Breeds_\r\n\r\n  1. Cleveland Bay, developed in England.\r\n  2. French Coach, the gentleman's horse of France.\r\n  3. German Coach, from Germany.\r\n  4. Oldenburg Coach, Oldenburg, Germany.\r\n  5. Hackney, the English high-stepper.\r\n\r\n  III. _Light, or Roadster, Breeds_\r\n\r\n  1. American Trotter, developed in America.\r\n  2. Thoroughbred, the English running horse.\r\n  3. American Saddle Horse, from Kentucky and Virginia.\r\n\r\nThere is a marked difference in the form and type of these horses, and\r\non this difference their usefulness depends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 242. WIDE HOCK\r\nThis horse stands great strains and is not fatigued easily]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 243. NARROW HOCK\r\nThis horse becomes exhausted very easily]\r\n\r\nThe draft breeds have short legs, and hence their bodies are\r\ncomparatively close to the ground. The depth of the body should be about\r\nthe same as the length of leg. All draft horses should have upright\r\nshoulders, so as to provide an easy support for the collar. The hock\r\nshould be wide, so that the animal shall have great leverage of muscle\r\nfor pulling. A horse having a narrow hock is not able to draw a heavy\r\nload and is easily exhausted and liable to curb-diseases (see Figs. 242\r\nand 243).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 244. THE ROADSTER TYPE]\r\n\r\nThe legs of all kinds of horses should be straight; a line dropped from\r\nthe point of the shoulder to the ground should divide the knees, canon,\r\nfetlock, and foot into two equal parts. When the animal is formed in\r\nthis way the feet have room to be straight and square, with just the\r\nbreadth of a hoof between them (Fig. 241).\r\n\r\nRoadsters are lighter in bone and less heavily muscled; their legs are\r\nlonger than those of the draft horses and, as horsemen say, more\r\n\"daylight\" can be seen under the body. The neck is long and thin, but\r\nfits nicely into the shoulders. The shoulders are sloping and long and\r\ngive the roadster ability to reach well out in his stride. The head is\r\nset gracefully on the neck and should be carried with ease and\r\nerectness.\r\n\r\nEvery man who is to deal with horses ought to become, by observation and\r\nstudy, an expert judge of forms, qualities, types, defects, and\r\nexcellences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 245. SIDE VIEW OF LEGS\r\nThe diagram shows how the straight lines ought to cross the legs of a\r\nproperly shaped horse]\r\n\r\nThe horse's foot makes an interesting study. The horny outside protects\r\nthe foot from mud, ice, and stones. Inside the hoof are the bones and\r\ngristle that serve as cushions to diminish the shock received while\r\nwalking or running on hard roads or streets. When shoeing the horse the\r\nfrog should not be touched with the knife. It is very seldom that any\r\ncutting need be done. Many blacksmiths do not know this and often\r\ngreatly injure the foot.\r\n\r\nSince the horse has but a small stomach, the food given should not be\r\ntoo bulky. In proportion to the horse's size, its grain ration should be\r\nlarger than that of other animals. Draft horses and mules, however, can\r\nbe fed a more bulky ration than other horses, because they have larger\r\nstomachs and consequently have more room to store food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 246. HOW TO MEASURE A HORSE]\r\n\r\nThe horse should be groomed every day. This keeps the pores of the skin\r\nopen and the hair bright and glossy. When horses are working hard, the\r\nharness should be removed during the noon hour. During the cool seasons\r\nof the year, whenever a horse is wet with sweat, it should on stopping\r\nwork, or when standing for awhile, be blanketed, for the animal is as\r\nliable as man to get cold in a draft or from moisture evaporating\r\nrapidly from its skin.\r\n\r\n     EXERCISE\r\n\r\n     If the pupil will take an ordinary tape measure, he can make some\r\n     measurements of the horse that will be very interesting as well as\r\n     profitable. Let him measure:\r\n\r\n     1. The height of the horse at the withers, 1 to 1.\r\n     2. The height of the horse at croup, 2 to 2.\r\n     3. Length of shoulder, 1 to 3.\r\n     4. Length of back, 4.\r\n     5. Length of head, 5.\r\n     6. Depth of body, 6 to 6.\r\n     7. Daylight under body, 7 to 7.\r\n     8. Distance from point of shoulder to quarter, 3 to 3.\r\n     9. Width of forehead.\r\n     10. Width between hips.\r\n\r\n     NOTE. Many interesting comparisons can be made (1) by\r\n     measuring several horses; (2) by studying the proportion between\r\n     parts of the same horse.\r\n\r\n     PROPORTIONS OF A HORSE\r\n\r\n     1. How many times longer is the body than the head? Do you get the\r\n     same result from different horses?\r\n\r\n     2. How does the height at the withers compare with the height at\r\n     the croup?\r\n\r\n     3. How do these compare with the distance from quarter to shoulder?\r\n\r\n     4. How does the length of the head compare with the thickness of\r\n     the body and with the open space, or \"daylight,\" under the body?\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LIV. CATTLE\r\n\r\nAll farm animals were once called _cattle_; now this term applies only\r\nto beef and dairy animals--neat cattle.\r\n\r\nOur improved breeds are descended from the wild ox of Europe and Asia,\r\nand have attained their size and usefulness by care, food, and\r\nselection. The uses of cattle are so familiar that we need scarcely\r\nmention them. Their flesh is a part of man's daily food; their milk,\r\ncream, butter, and cheese are on most tables; their hides go to make\r\nleather, and their hair for plaster; their hoofs are used for glue, and\r\ntheir bones for fertilizers, ornaments, buttons, and many other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 247. A PRIZE-WINNER]\r\n\r\nThere are two main classes of cattle--beef breeds and dairy breeds. The\r\nprincipal breeds of each class are as follows:\r\n\r\n  I. _Beef Breeds_\r\n\r\n  1. Aberdeen-Angus, bred in Scotland, and often called _doddies_.\r\n  2. Galloway, from Scotland.\r\n  3. Shorthorn, an English breed of cattle.\r\n  4. Hereford, also an English breed.\r\n  5. Sussex, from the county of Sussex, England.\r\n\r\n  II. _Dairy Breeds_\r\n\r\n  1. Jersey, from the Isle of Jersey.\r\n  2. Guernsey, from the Isle of Guernsey.\r\n  3. Ayrshire, from Scotland.\r\n  4. Holstein-Frisian, from Holland and Denmark.\r\n  5. Brown Swiss, from Switzerland.\r\n\r\nOther breeds of cattle are Devon, Dutch Belted, Red-Polled, Kerry, and\r\nWest Highland.\r\n\r\nIn general structure there is a marked difference between the beef and\r\ndairy breeds. This is shown in Figs. 248, 249. The beef cow is square,\r\nfull over the back and loins, and straight in the back. The hips are\r\ncovered evenly with flesh, the legs full and thick, the under line, or\r\nstomach line, parallel to the back line, and the neck full and short.\r\nThe eye should be bright, the face short, the bones of fine texture, and\r\nthe skin soft and pliable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 248. ABERDEEN-ANGUS COW (A BEEF TYPE)]\r\n\r\nThe dairy cow is widely different from the beef cow. She shows a decided\r\nwedge shape when you look at her from front, side, or rear. The back\r\nline is crooked, the hip bones and tail bone are prominent, the thighs\r\nthin and poorly fleshed; there is no breadth to the back, as in the beef\r\ncow, and little flesh covers the shoulders; the neck is long and thin.\r\n\r\nThe udder of the dairy cow is most important. It should be full but not\r\nfleshy, be well attached behind, and extend well forward. The larger the\r\nudder the more milk will be given.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the dairy cow, like that of the beef breeds, should be soft\r\nand pliable and the bones fine-textured.\r\n\r\n=The Dairy Type.= Because of lack of flesh on the back, loins, and\r\nthighs, the cow of the dairy type is not profitably raised for beef, nor\r\nis the beef so good as that of the beef types. This is because in the\r\ndairy-animal food goes to produce milk rather than beef. In the same way\r\nthe beef cow gives little milk, since her food goes rather to fat than\r\nto milk. For the same reasons that you do not expect a plow horse to win\r\non the race track, you do not expect a cow of the beef type to win\r\npremiums as a milker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 249. JERSEY COW (A DAIRY TYPE)]\r\n\r\n\"Scrub\" cattle are not profitable. They mature slowly and consequently\r\nconsume much food before they are able to give any return for it. Even\r\nwhen fattened, the fat and lean portions are not evenly distributed,\r\nand \"choice cuts\" are few and small.\r\n\r\nBy far the cheapest method of securing a healthy and profitable herd of\r\ndairy or beef cattle is to save only the calves whose sires are\r\npure-bred animals and whose mothers are native cows. In this way farmers\r\nof even little means can soon build up an excellent herd.\r\n\r\n=Improving Cattle.= The fact that it is not possible for every farmer to\r\npossess pure-bred cattle is no reason why he should not improve the\r\nstock he has. He can do this by using pure-bred sires that possess the\r\nqualities most to be desired. Scrub stock can be quickly improved by the\r\ncontinuous use of good sires. It is never wise to use grade, or\r\ncross-bred, sires, since the best qualities are not fixed in them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 250. HEAD OF A GALLOWAY COW]\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is possible for every farmer to determine exactly the\r\nproducing-power of his dairy cows. When the cows are milked, the milk\r\nshould be weighed and a record kept. If this be done, it will be found\r\nthat some cows produce as much as five hundred, and some as much as ten\r\nhundred, gallons a year, while others produce not more than two or three\r\nhundred gallons. If a farmer kills or sells his poor cows and keeps his\r\nbest ones, he will soon have a herd of only heavy milkers. Ask your\r\nfather to try this plan. Read everything you can find about taking care\r\nof cows and improving them, and then start a herd of your own.\r\n\r\n=Conclusions.= (1) A cow with a tendency to get fat is not profitable\r\nfor the dairy. (2) A thin, open, angular cow will make expensive beef.\r\n(3) \"The sire is half the herd.\" This means that a good sire is\r\nnecessary to improve a herd of cattle. The improvement from scrubs\r\nupward is as follows: the first generation is one-half pure; the second\r\nis three-fourths pure; the third is seven-eighths pure; the fourth is\r\nfifteen-sixteenths pure, etc. (4) By keeping a record of the quantity\r\nand quality of milk each cow gives you can tell which are profitable to\r\nraise from and which are not. (5) Good food, clean water, kindness, and\r\ncare are necessary to successful cattle-raising.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 251. HOLSTEIN COW]\r\n\r\nThe ownership of a well-bred animal usually arouses so much pride in the\r\nowner that the animal receives all the care that it merits. The watchful\r\ncare given to such an animal leads to more thought of the other animals\r\non the farm, and often brings about the upbuilding of an entire herd.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LV. SHEEP\r\n\r\nThe sheep was perhaps the first animal domesticated by man, and to-day\r\nthe domesticated sheep is found wherever man lives. It is found\r\ndomesticated or wild in almost every climate, and finds means to thrive\r\nwhere other animals can scarcely live; it provides man with meat and\r\nclothing, and is one of the most profitable and most easily cared-for of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 252. A YOUNG SHEPHERD]\r\n\r\nSheep increase so rapidly, mature at such an early age, and have flesh\r\nso wholesome for food that nearly every farm should have its flock.\r\nAnother consideration that may be urged in favor of sheep-raising is\r\nthat sheep improve the land on which they are pastured.\r\n\r\nSheep are docile and easily handled, and they live on a greater\r\ndiversity of food and require less grain than any other kind of live\r\nstock. In mixed farming there is enough food wasted on most farms to\r\nmaintain a small flock of sheep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 253. SHEEP HAVE LONG BEEN CALLED THE\r\nGOLDEN-HOOFED ANIMALS]\r\n\r\nSheep may be divided into three classes:\r\n\r\n  I. _Fine-Wooled Breeds_\r\n\r\n    1. American Merino.\r\n    2. Delaine Merino.\r\n    3. Rambouillets.\r\n    4. Hampshire Down.\r\n    5. Oxford Down.\r\n    6. Cheviot.\r\n\r\n  II. _Medium-Wooled Breeds_\r\n\r\n    1. Southdown.\r\n    2. Shropshire.\r\n    3. Horned Dorset.\r\n\r\n  III. _Long-Wooled Breeds_\r\n\r\n    1. Leicester.\r\n    2. Lincoln.\r\n    3. Cotswold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 254. IN THE PASTURE]\r\n\r\nThe first group is grown principally for wool, and mutton is secondary;\r\nin the second group, mutton comes first and wool second; in the third\r\ngroup both are important considerations. Wool is nature's protection for\r\nthe sheep. Have you ever opened the fleece and observed the clean skin\r\nin which the fibers grow? These fibers, or hairs, are so roughened that\r\nthey push all dirt away from the skin toward the outside of the fleece.\r\n\r\nWool is valuable in proportion to the length and evenness of the fiber\r\nand the density of the fleece.\r\n\r\n     EXERCISE\r\n\r\n     1. How many pounds ought a fleece of wool to weigh?\r\n     2. Which makes the better clothing, coarse or fine wool?\r\n     3. Why are sheep washed before being sheared?\r\n     4. Does cold weather trouble sheep? wet weather?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LVI. SWINE\r\n\r\nThe wild boar is a native of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The wild hogs are\r\nthe parents from which all our domestic breeds have sprung. In many\r\nparts of the world the wild boar is still found. These animals are\r\nactive and powerful, and as they grow older are fierce and dangerous. In\r\ntheir wild state they seek moist, sandy, and well-wooded places, close\r\nto streams of water. Their favorite foods are fruits, grass, and roots,\r\nbut when pressed by hunger they will eat snakes, worms, and even higher\r\nanimals, like birds, fowls, and fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 255. WHICH WILL YOU RAISE?]\r\n\r\nMan captured some of these wild animals, fed them abundant and\r\nnutritious food, accustomed them to domestic life, selected the best of\r\nthem to raise from, and in the course of generations developed our\r\npresent breeds of hogs. The main changes brought about in hogs were\r\nthese: the legs became shorter, the snout and neck likewise shortened,\r\nthe shoulders and hams increased their power to take on flesh, and the\r\nframe was strengthened to carry the added burden of flesh. As the animal\r\ngrew heavier it roamed less widely, and as it grew accustomed to man its\r\ntemper became less fierce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 256. A PAIR OF PORKERS]\r\n\r\nMeat can be more cheaply obtained from hogs than from any other animal.\r\nWhen a hog is properly fed and cared for it will make the farmer more\r\nmoney in proportion to cost than any other animal on the farm.\r\n\r\nThe most profitable type of hog has short legs, small bones, straight\r\nback and under line, heavy hams, small well-dished head, and heavy\r\nshoulders. The scrub and \"razorback\" hogs are very unprofitable, and\r\nrequire an undue amount of food to produce a pound of gain. It requires\r\ntwo years to get the scrub to weigh what a well-bred pig will weigh\r\nwhen nine months old. Scrub hogs can be quickly changed in form and type\r\nby the use of a pure-bred sire.\r\n\r\nA boy whose parents were too poor to send him to college once decided to\r\nmake his own money and get an education. He bought a sow and began to\r\nraise pigs. He earned the food for the mother and her pigs. His hogs\r\nincreased so rapidly that he had to work hard to keep them in food. By\r\nsaving the money he received from the sale of his hogs he had enough to\r\nkeep him two years in college. Suppose you try his plan, and let the hog\r\nshow you how fast it can make money.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 257. A GOOD TYPE]\r\n\r\nWe have several breeds of swine. The important ones are:\r\n\r\n  I. _Large Breeds_\r\n\r\n    1. Chester White.\r\n    2. Improved Yorkshire.\r\n    3. Tamworth.\r\n\r\n  II. _Medium Breeds_\r\n\r\n    1. Berkshire.\r\n    2. Poland-China.\r\n    3. Duroc-Jersey.\r\n    4. Cheshire.\r\n\r\n  III. _Small Breeds_\r\n\r\n    1. Victoria.\r\n    2. Suffolk.\r\n    3. Essex.\r\n    4. Small Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nHogs will be most successfully raised when kept as little as possible in\r\npens. They like the fields and the pasture grass, the open air and the\r\nsunshine. Almost any kind of food can be given them. Unlike other stock,\r\nthey will devour greedily and tirelessly the richest feeding-stuffs.\r\n\r\nThe most desirable hog to raise is one that will produce a more or less\r\neven mixture of fat and lean. Where only corn is fed, the body becomes\r\nvery fat and is not so desirable for food as when middlings, tankage,\r\ncowpeas, or soy beans are added as a part of the ration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 258. DINNER IS OVER]\r\n\r\nWhen hogs are kept in pens, cleanliness is most important, for only by\r\ncleanliness can disease be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LVII. FARM POULTRY\r\n\r\nOur geese, ducks, turkeys, and domestic hens are all descendants of wild\r\nfowls, and are more or less similar to them in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe earliest recorded uses of fowls were for food, for fighting, and for\r\nsacrifice. To-day the domestic fowl has four well-defined\r\nuses--egg-production, meat-production, feather-production, and\r\npest-destruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STANDARD-BRED FOWLS\r\nBarred Plymouth Rocks, male and female; White Wyandottes, female and\r\nmale]\r\n\r\nHens of course produce most of our eggs. Some duck eggs are sold for\r\ntable use. Goose and duck body-feathers bring good prices. As\r\npest-destroyers turkeys and chickens are most useful. They eat large\r\nnumbers of bugs and worms that are harmful to crops. A little proper\r\nattention would very largely increase the already handsome sum derived\r\nfrom our fowls. They need dry, warm, well-lighted, and tidily kept\r\nhouses. They must have, if we want the best returns, an abundant supply\r\nof pure water and a variety of nutritious foods. In cold, rainy, or\r\nsnowy weather they should have a sheltered yard, and in good weather\r\nshould be allowed a range wide enough to give them exercise. Their\r\nbodies and their nests must be protected from every form of vermin.\r\n\r\nFor eggs, the Leghorn varieties are popular. Some hens of this breed\r\nhave been known to lay more than two hundred eggs in a year. Specially\r\ncared-for flocks have averaged eleven or even twelve dozen eggs a year.\r\nFarm flocks of ordinary breeds average less than eight dozen. Other\r\nexcellent egg breeds are the Spanish, Andalusian, and Minorca.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 259. COCK]\r\n\r\nThe principal so-called meat breeds are the Brahma, Cochin, and\r\nLangshan. These are very large, but rather slow-growing fowls, and are\r\nnot noted as layers. They are far less popular in America, even as\r\nmeat-producers, than the general-purpose breeds.\r\n\r\nThe Plymouth Rock, Wyandotte, Rhode Island Red, and Orpington are the\r\nleading general-purpose breeds. They are favorites because they are at\r\nonce good-sized, good layers, tame, and good mothers. The chicks of\r\nthese breeds are hardy and thrifty. In addition to these breeds, there\r\nare many so-called fancy breeds that are prized for their looks rather\r\nthan for their value. Among these are the Hamburg, Polish, Sultan,\r\nSilkie, and the many Bantam breeds.\r\n\r\nThe leading duck breeds are the Pekin, Aylesbury, Indian Runner,\r\nMuscovy, Rouen, and Cayuga. The principal varieties of geese are the\r\nToulouse, Emden, Chinese, and African.\r\n\r\nAmong the best breeds of turkeys are the Bronze, White Holland,\r\nNarragansett, Bourbon, Slate, and Buff.\r\n\r\nGeese, ducks, and turkeys are not so generally raised as hens, but there\r\nis a constant demand at good prices for these fowls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 260. BROODER]\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the domestic hen are as follows:\r\n\r\n  I. _Egg Breeds_\r\n\r\n  1. Leghorn.\r\n  2. Minorca.\r\n  3. Spanish.\r\n  4. Blue Andalusian.\r\n  5. Anconas.\r\n\r\n  II. _Meat Breeds_\r\n\r\n  1. Brahma.\r\n  2. Cochin.\r\n  3. Langshan.\r\n  4. Dorking.\r\n  5. Cornish.\r\n\r\n  III. _General-Purpose Breeds_\r\n\r\n  1. Plymouth Rock.\r\n  2. Wyandotte.\r\n  3. Rhode Island Red.\r\n  4. Orpington.\r\n\r\n  IV. _Fancy Breeds_\r\n\r\n  1. Polish.\r\n  2. Game.\r\n  3. Sultan.\r\n  4. Bantam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 261. BREEDING YARDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 262. INCUBATOR]\r\n\r\nAs the price of both eggs and fowls is steadily advancing, a great many\r\npeople are now raising fowls by means of an incubator for hatching, and\r\na brooder as a substitute for the mother hen.\r\n\r\nThe use of the incubator is extending each year and is now almost\r\nuniversal where any considerable number of chicks are to be hatched.\r\nDoubtless it will continue to be used wherever poultry-production is\r\nengaged in on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe brooder is employed to take care of the chickens as soon as they\r\nleave the incubator.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LVIII. BEE CULTURE\r\n\r\nStock-raisers select breeds that are best adapted to their needs.\r\nPlant-growers exercise great care in their choice of plants, selecting\r\nfor each planting those best suited to the conditions under which they\r\nare to be grown. Undoubtedly a larger yield of honey could be had each\r\nyear if similar care were exercised in the selection of the breed of\r\nbees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 263. A CARNIOLAN WORKER]\r\n\r\nTo prove this, one has only to compare the yield of two different kinds.\r\nThe common East Indian honey bee rarely produces more than ten or twelve\r\npounds to a hive, while the Cyprian bee, which is a most industrious\r\nworker, has a record of one thousand pounds in one season from a single\r\ncolony. This bee, besides being industrious when honey material is\r\nplentiful, is also very persevering when such material is hard to find.\r\nThe Cyprians have two other very desirable qualities. They stand the\r\ncold of winter well and stoutly defend their hives against robber bees\r\nand other enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Italian is another good bee. This variety was brought into the\r\nUnited States in 1860. While the yield from the Italian is somewhat less\r\nthan from the Cyprian, the Italian bees produce a whiter comb and are a\r\ntrifle more easily managed.\r\n\r\nThe common black or brown bee is found wild and domesticated throughout\r\nthe country. When honey material is abundant, these bees equal the\r\nItalians in honey-production, but when the season is poor, they fall far\r\nshort in the amount of honey produced.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of a good Cyprian or Italian hive will richly repay the\r\nbuyer. Such a colony will cost more at the outset than an ordinary\r\ncolony, but will soon pay for its higher cost by greater production.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 264. A CARNIOLAN DRONE]\r\n\r\nA beehive in the spring contains one queen, several hundred drones, and\r\nfrom thirty-five to forty thousand workers. The duty of the queen is to\r\nlay all the eggs that are to hatch the future bees. This she does with\r\nuntiring industry, often laying as many as four thousand in twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThe worker bees do all the work. Some of them visit the flowers, take up\r\nthe nectar into the honey-sac, located in their abdomens, and carry it\r\nto the hive. They also gather pollen in basketlike cavities in their\r\nhind legs. Pollen and nectar are needed to prepare food for the young\r\nbees. In the hive other workers create a breeze by buzzing with their\r\nwings and produce heat by their activity--all to cause the water to\r\nevaporate from the nectar and to convert it into honey before it is\r\nsealed up in the comb. After a successful day's gathering you may often\r\nhear these tireless workers buzzing till late into the night or even all\r\nthrough the night.\r\n\r\nYou know that the bees get nectar from the flowers of various plants.\r\nSome of the chief honey plants are alfalfa, buckwheat, horsemint,\r\nsourwood, white sage, wild pennyroyal, black gum, holly, chestnut,\r\nmagnolia, and the tulip tree. The yield of honey may often be increased\r\nby providing special pasturage for the bees. The linden tree, for\r\nexample, besides being ornamental and valuable for timber, produces a\r\nmost bee-inviting flower. Vetch, clover, and most of the legumes and\r\nmints are valuable plants to furnish pasture for bees. Catnip may be\r\ncultivated for the bees and sold as an herb as well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 265. A CARNIOLAN QUEEN]\r\n\r\nIn spraying fruit trees to prevent disease you should always avoid\r\nspraying when the trees are in bloom, since the poison of the spray\r\nseriously endangers the lives of bees.\r\n\r\nThe eggs laid by the queen, if they are to produce workers, require\r\nabout twenty-one days to bring forth the perfect bee. The newly hatched\r\nbee commences life as a nurse. When about ten days old it begins to try\r\nits wings in short flights, and a few days later it begins active work.\r\nThe life of a worker bee in the busy season is only about six weeks. You\r\nmay distinguish young exercising bees from real workers by the fact that\r\nthey do not fly directly away on emerging from the hive, but circle\r\naround a bit in order to make sure that they can recognize home again,\r\nsince they would receive no cordial welcome if they should attempt to\r\nenter another hive. They hesitate upon returning from even these short\r\nflights, to make sure that they are in front of their own door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 266. GOOD FORM OF HIVE]\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of enemies of the bee which all beekeepers\r\nshould know. One of these is the robber bee, that is, a bee from another\r\ncolony attempting to steal honey from the rightful owners, an attempt\r\noften resulting in frightful slaughter. Much robbery can be avoided by\r\nclean handling; that is, by leaving no honey about to cultivate a taste\r\nfor stolen sweets. The bee moth is another serious enemy. The larva of\r\nthe moth feeds on the wax. Keep the colonies of bees strong so that they\r\nmay be able to overcome this moth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 267. ANTI-ROBBING ENTRANCE\r\n_st_, stationary piece; _s_, slide; _p_, pin, or stop]\r\n\r\nQueenless or otherwise weak colonies should be protected by a narrow\r\nentrance that admits only one bee at a time, for such a pass may be\r\neasily guarded. Fig. 267 shows a good anti-robbery entrance which may be\r\nreadily provided for every weak colony. Mice may be kept out by\r\ntin-lined entrances. The widespread fear of the kingbird seems\r\nunfounded. He rarely eats anything but drones, and few of them. This is\r\nalso true of the swallow. Toads, lizards, and spiders are, however, true\r\nenemies of the honeybee.\r\n\r\n     EXERCISE\r\n\r\n     Can you recognize drones, workers, and queens? Do bees usually\r\n     limit their visits to one kind of blossom on any one trip? What\r\n     effect has the kind of flower on the flavor of the honey produced?\r\n     What kinds of flowers should the beekeeper provide for his bees? Is\r\n     the kingbird really an enemy to the bee?\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LIX. WHY WE FEED ANIMALS\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we give various kinds of feed stuffs to our animals\r\nthat they may live. The heart beats all the time, the lungs contract and\r\nexpand, digestion is taking place, the blood circulates through the\r\nbody--something must supply force for these acts or the animal dies.\r\nThis force is derived from food.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, food is required to keep the body warm. Food in this\r\nrespect is fuel, and acts in the same way that wood or coal does in the\r\nstove. Our bodies are warm all the time, and they are kept warm by the\r\nfood we eat at mealtime.\r\n\r\nThen, in the third place, food is required to enable the body to\r\nenlarge--to grow. If you feed a colt just enough to keep it alive and\r\nwarm, there will be no material present to enable it to grow; hence you\r\nmust add enough food to form bone and flesh and muscle and hair and fat.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth place, we feed to produce strength for work. An animal\r\npoorly fed cannot do so much work at the plow or on the road as one that\r\nreceives all the food needed.\r\n\r\nBoth food and the force produced by it result from the activity of\r\nplants. By means of sunlight and moisture a sprouting seed, taking out\r\nof the air and soil different elements, grows into a plant. Then, just\r\nas the plant feeds on the air and soil to get its growth, so the animal\r\nfeeds on the plant, to get its growth. Hence, since our animals feed\r\nupon plants, we must find out what is in plants in order to know what\r\nanimal food consists of.\r\n\r\nPlants contain protein, carbohydrates, fat, mineral matter, water, and\r\nvitamins. You have seen protein compounds like the white of an egg, lean\r\nmeat, or the gluten of wheat. The bodies of plants do not contain very\r\nmuch protein. On the other hand, all plant seeds contain a good deal of\r\nthis substance. Animals make use of protein to form new blood, muscles,\r\nand organs. Because of the quality of protein, milk is the best food for\r\nchildren and young animals.\r\n\r\nThe protein in some foods is of poor quality. To insure a well-balanced\r\nsupply of protein a variety in foods is desirable. Do not rely on a\r\nsingle kind of mill feed, but combine several kinds, such as cotton-seed\r\nmeal, linseed meal, wheat bran and middlings, gluten, and similar grain\r\nby-products. Tankage for young pigs and meat scraps for chickens are\r\nhigh-grade proteins and are of animal origin.\r\n\r\nIt is no less important to get the necessary vitamins--those mysterious\r\nsubstances that keep the body healthy and promote growth and well-being.\r\nScientists claim that many diseases are food-deficiency diseases--the\r\nbody gets out of order because these peculiar vitamins are lacking in\r\nthe food. Children require about one or two quarts of milk a day, fresh\r\nfruits, cereal breakfast foods, leafy vegetables as salads, and cooked\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nFarm animals require the vitamins also. The legume pasture or hay, milk,\r\ngrain concentrates when supplied in variety, pasture grass, and green\r\nforage crops are basic foods for farm animals. Very young animals should\r\nhave milk also.\r\n\r\nLet us next consider the carbohydrates. Sometimes the words _starchy\r\nfoods_ are used to describe the carbohydrates. You have long known\r\nforms of these in the white material of corn and of potatoes. The\r\ncarbohydrates are formed of three elements--carbon, oxygen, and\r\nhydrogen. The use of these carbohydrates is to furnish to animal bodies\r\neither heat or energy or to enable them to store fat.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, let us look at the fat in plant food. This consists\r\nof the oil stored up in the seeds and other parts of the plant. The\r\ngrains contain most of the oil. Fat is used by the animal to make heat\r\nand energy or to be stored away in the body.\r\n\r\nThe next animal food in the plant that we are to think about is the\r\nmineral matter. The ashes of a burnt plant furnish a common example of\r\nthis mineral matter. The animal uses this material of the plant to make\r\nbone, teeth, and tissue.\r\n\r\nThe last thing that the plant furnishes the animal is water--just common\r\nwater. Young plants contain comparatively large quantities of water.\r\nThis is one reason why they are soft, juicy, and palatable. But, since\r\nanimals get their water chiefly in another way, the water in feed stuffs\r\nis not important.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THESE COMPOUNDS DO IN THE BODY\r\n\r\n  _Protein_\r\n\r\n  1.

THE DAIRY COW\r\n\r\nSuccess in dairy farming depends largely upon the proper feeding of\r\nstock. There are two questions that the dairy farmer should always ask\r\nhimself: Am I feeding as cheaply as I can? and, Am I feeding the best\r\nrations for milk and butter production? Of course cows can be kept alive\r\nand in fairly good milk flow on many different kinds of food, but in\r\nfeeding, as in everything else, there is an ideal to be sought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 268. MILKING-TIME]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is an ideal ration for a dairy cow? Before trying to answer\r\nthis question the word _ration_ needs to be explained. By ration is\r\nmeant a sufficient quantity of food to support properly an animal for\r\none day. If the animal is to have a proper ration, we must bear in mind\r\nwhat the animal needs in order to be best nourished. To get material for\r\nmuscle, for blood, for milk, and for some other things, the animal\r\nneeds, in the first place, food that contains protein. To keep warm and\r\nfat, the animal must, in the second place, have food containing\r\ncarbohydrates and fats. These foods must be mixed in right proportions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 269. A DAIRY]\r\n\r\nWith these facts in mind we are prepared for an answer to the question,\r\nWhat is an ideal ration?\r\n\r\nFirst, it is a ration that, without waste, furnishes both in weight and\r\nbulk of dry matter a sufficient amount of digestible, nutritious food.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is a ration that is comparatively cheap.\r\n\r\nThird, it is a ration in which the milk-forming food (protein) is\r\nrightly proportioned to the heat-making and fat-making food\r\n(carbohydrates and fat). Any ration in which this proportion is\r\nneglected is badly balanced.\r\n\r\nNow test one or two commonly used rations by these rules. Would a ration\r\nof cotton-seed meal and cotton-seed hulls be a model ration? No. Such a\r\nration, since the seeds are grown at home, would be cheap enough.\r\nHowever, it is badly balanced, for it is too rich in protein; hence it\r\nis a wasteful ration. Would a ration of corn meal and corn stover be a\r\ndesirable ration? This, too, since the corn is home-grown, would be\r\ncheap for the farmer; but, like the other, it is badly balanced, for it\r\ncontains too much carbohydrate food and is therefore a wasteful ration.\r\n\r\nA badly balanced ration does harm in two ways: first, the milk flow of\r\nthe cow is lessened by such a ration; second, the cow does not\r\nprofitably use the food that she eats.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives an excellent dairy ration for the farmer who\r\nhas a silo. If he does not have a silo, some other food can be used in\r\nplace of the ensilage. The table also shows what each food contains. As\r\nyou grow older, it will pay you to study such tables most carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ===============================================================\r\n                              |      DIGESTIBLE MATTER\r\n                              |----------------------------------\r\n        FEED STUFFS          | Dry  |Protein|Carbohydrates| Fat\r\n                              |matter|       |             |\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Cowpea hay = 15 pounds[1]   | 13.50|  1.62 |        5.79 | .16\r\n  Corn stover = 10 pounds     |  5.95|   .17 |        3.24 | .07\r\n  Corn ensilage = 30 pounds   |  6.27|   .27 |        3.39 | .21\r\n  Cotton-seed meal = 2 pounds |  1.83|   .74 |         .33 | .24\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Total = 57 pounds           | 27.55|  2.80 |       12.75 | .68\r\n  ===============================================================\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Alfalfa or clover hay may take the place of cowpea hay.]\r\n\r\n=Care of the Cow.= As the cow is one of the best money-makers on the\r\nfarm, she should, for this reason, if for no other, be comfortably\r\nhoused, well fed and watered, and most kindly treated. In your thoughts\r\nfor her well-being, bear the following directions in mind:\r\n\r\n1. If you are not following a balanced ration, feed each day several\r\ndifferent kinds of food. In this way you will be least likely to waste\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n2. Feed at regular hours. Cows, like people, thrive best when their\r\nlives are orderly.\r\n\r\n3. Milk at regular hours.\r\n\r\n4. Brush the udder carefully with a moist cloth before you begin to\r\nmilk. Cleanliness in handling makes the milk keep longer.\r\n\r\n5. Always milk in buckets or cups that have been scalded since the last\r\nusing. The hot water kills the bacteria that collect in the dents or\r\ncracks of the utensil.\r\n\r\n6. Never let the milk pail remain in the stable. Milk rapidly absorbs\r\nimpurities. These spoil the flavor and cause the milk to sour.\r\n\r\n7. Never scold or strike the cow. She is a nervous animal, and rough\r\nusage checks the milk flow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE GENERATIONS OF HIGH-BRED COWS]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LXI. MILK, CREAM, CHURNING, AND BUTTER\r\n\r\n=Milk.= Milk is, as you know, nature's first food for mammals. This is\r\nbecause milk is a model food--it contains water to slake thirst, ash to\r\nmake bone, protein to make flesh and muscle, and fat and sugar to keep\r\nthe body warm and to furnish energy.\r\n\r\n=The Different Kinds of Milk.= Whole, or unskimmed, milk, skimmed milk,\r\nand buttermilk are too familiar to need description. When a cow is just\r\nfresh, her milk is called _colostrum_. Colostrum is rich in the very\r\nfood that the baby calf needs. After the calf is a few days old,\r\ncolostrum changes to what is commonly known as milk.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the composition of each of the different forms\r\nof milk:\r\n\r\n  =======================================================\r\n                      |   DIGESTIBLE MATTER IN 100 POUNDS\r\n                      |----------------------------------\r\n  COMPOSITION OF MILK |  Dry |Protein|Carbohydrates| Fat\r\n                      |matter|       |             |\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Colostrum           | 25.4 |  17.6 |      2.7    | 3.6\r\n  Milk (unskimmed)    | 12.8 |   3.6 |      4.9    | 3.7\r\n  Skimmed milk        |  9.4 |   2.9 |      5.2    | 1.3\r\n  Buttermilk          |  9.9 |   3.9 |      4.0    | 1.1\r\n  =======================================================\r\n\r\nA noticeable fact in this table is that skimmed milk differs from\r\nunskimmed mainly in the withdrawal of the fat. Hence, if calves are fed\r\non skimmed milk, they should have in addition some food like corn meal\r\nto take the place of the fat withdrawn. A calf cannot thrive on skimmed\r\nmilk alone. The amount of nourishing fat that a calf gets out of enough\r\nmilk to make a pound of butter can be bought, in the form of linseed or\r\ncorn meal, for a very small amount, while the butter-fat costs, for\r\ntable use, a much larger sum. Of course, then, it is not economical to\r\nallow calves to use unskimmed milk. Some people undervalue skimmed milk;\r\nwith the addition of some fatty food it makes an excellent ration for\r\ncalves, pigs, and fowls.\r\n\r\nAlong with its dry matter, its protein, its carbohydrates, and its fats,\r\nmilk and its products possess another most important property. This\r\nproperty is hard to describe, for its elements and its powers are not\r\nyet fully understood. We do, however, know certainly this much: milk and\r\nthe foods made from it have power to promote health and favor growth in\r\na more marked degree than any other foods. It is generally agreed that\r\nthis is due to the health-promoting and health-preserving substances\r\nwhich are called vitamines. Men of science are working with much care to\r\ntry to add to our knowledge of these vitamines, which have so marvelous\r\nan influence on the health of all animals. Unless food, no matter how\r\ngood otherwise, contains these vitamines, it does not nourish the body\r\nnor preserve bodily health as it should. A complete lack of vitamines in\r\nour food would cause death. Since, then, milk and its products--butter,\r\ncheese, curds--are rich in vitamines, these health-giving and\r\nhealth-preserving foods should form a regular part of each person's\r\ndiet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 270. AIRING THE CANS]\r\n\r\n=Cream.= Cream is simply a mixture of butter-fat and milk. The\r\nbutter-fat floats in the milk in little globe-shaped bodies, or\r\nglobules. Since these globules are lighter than milk, they rise to the\r\nsurface. Skimming the milk is a mere gathering together of these\r\nbutter-fat globules. As most of the butter-fat is contained in the\r\ncream, pains should be taken to get all the cream from the milk at\r\nskimming time.\r\n\r\nAfter the cream has been collected, it must be allowed to \"ripen\" or to\r\n\"sour\" in order that it may be more easily churned. Churning is only a\r\nsecond step to collect in a compact shape the fat globules. It often\r\nhappens that at churning-time the cream is too warm for successful\r\nseparation of the globules. Whenever this is the case the cream must be\r\ncooled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 271. A HAND SEPARATOR]\r\n\r\n=The Churn.= Revolving churns without inside fixtures are best. Hence,\r\nin buying, select a barrel or a square box churn. This kind of churn\r\n\"brings the butter\" by the falling of the cream from side to side as the\r\nchurn is revolved. Never fill the churn more than one-third or one-half\r\nfull of cream. A small churn is always to be avoided.\r\n\r\n=Churning.= The proper temperature for churning ranges from 58 deg. to 62 deg.\r\nFahrenheit. Test the cream when it is put into the churn. If it be too\r\ncold, add warm water until the proper temperature is reached; if too\r\nwarm, add cold water or ice until the temperature is brought down to\r\n62 deg.. Do not churn too long, for this spoils butter. As soon as the\r\ngranules of butter are somewhat smaller than grains of wheat, stop the\r\nchurn. Then draw off the buttermilk and at a temperature as low as 50 deg.\r\nwash the butter in the churn. This washing with cold water so hardens\r\nthe granules that they do not mass too solidly and thus destroy the\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\n=Butter.= The butter so churned is now ready to be salted. Use good fine\r\ndairy salt. Coarse barrel salt is not fit for butter. The salt can be\r\nadded while the butter is still in the churn or after it is put upon the\r\nbutter-worker. Never work by hand. The object of working is to get the\r\nsalt evenly distributed and to drive out some of the brine. It is\r\nusually best to work butter twice. The two workings bring about a more\r\neven mixture of the salt with the butter and drive off more water. But\r\none cannot be too particular not to overwork butter. Delicate coloring,\r\nattractive stamping with the dairy owner's special stamp, and proper\r\ncovering with paper cost little and of course add to the ready and\r\nprofitable sale of butter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 272. A POWER CHURN]\r\n\r\n\r\nDAIRY RULES\r\n\r\n_Stable and Cows_\r\n\r\n1. Whitewash the stable once or twice each year; use land plaster, muck,\r\nor loam daily in the manure-gutters.\r\n\r\n2. On their way to pasture or milking-place, do not allow the cows to be\r\ndriven at a faster gait than a comfortable walk.\r\n\r\n3. Give abundance of pure water.\r\n\r\n4. Do not change feed suddenly.\r\n\r\n5. Keep salt always within reach of each cow.\r\n\r\n_Milking_\r\n\r\n1. Milk with dry hands.\r\n\r\n2. Never allow the milk to touch the milker's hands.\r\n\r\n3. Require the milker to be clean in person and dress.\r\n\r\n4. Milk quietly, quickly, thoroughly. Never leave a drop of milk in the\r\ncow's udder.\r\n\r\n5. Do not allow cats, dogs, or other animals around at milking-time.\r\n\r\n_Utensils_\r\n\r\n1. Use only tin or metal cans and pails.\r\n\r\n2. See that all utensils are thoroughly clean and free from rust.\r\n\r\n3. Require all cans and pails to be scalded immediately after they are\r\nused.\r\n\r\n4. After milking, keep the utensils inverted in pure air, and sun them,\r\nif possible, until they are wanted for use.\r\n\r\n5. Always sterilize the churn with steam or boiling water before and\r\nafter churning. This prevents any odors or bad flavors from affecting\r\nthe butter. All cans, pails, and bottles should also be sterilized\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LXII. HOW MILK SOURS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 273. MICROSCOPIC APPEARANCE OF PURE AND IMPURE MILK\r\nAt the left, pure milk; at the right, milk after standing in a warm room\r\nfor a few hours in a dirty dish, showing, besides the fat-globules, many\r\nforms of bacteria]\r\n\r\nOn another page you have been told how the yeast plant grows in cider\r\nand causes it to sour, and how bacteria sometimes cause disease in\r\nanimals and plants. Now you must learn what these same living forms have\r\nto do with the souring of milk, and maybe you will not forget how you\r\ncan prevent your milk from souring. In the first place, milk sours\r\nbecause bacteria from the air fall into the milk, begin to grow, and\r\nvery shortly change the sugar of the milk to an acid. When this acid\r\nbecomes abundant, the milk begins to curdle. As you know, the bacteria\r\nare in air, in water, and in barn dust; they stick on bits of hay and\r\nstick to the cow. They are most plentiful, however, in milk that has\r\nsoured; hence, if we pour a little sour milk into a pail of fresh milk,\r\nthe fresh milk will sour very quickly, because we have, so to speak,\r\n\"seeded\" or \"planted\" the fresh milk with the souring germs. No one, of\r\ncourse, ever does this purposely in the dairy, yet people sometimes do\r\nwhat amounts to the same thing--that is, put fresh milk into poorly\r\ncleaned pails or pans, the cracks and corners of which are cozy homes\r\nfor millions of germs left from the last sour milk contained in the\r\nvessel. It follows, then, that all utensils used in the dairy should be\r\nthoroughly scalded so as to kill all germs present, and particular care\r\nshould be taken to clean the cracks and crevices, for in them the germs\r\nlurk.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this thorough cleansing with hot water, we should be\r\ncareful never to stir up the dust of the barn just before milking. Such\r\ndusty work as pitching hay or stover or arranging bedding should be done\r\neither after or long before milking-time, for more germs fall into the\r\nmilk if the air be full of dust.\r\n\r\nTo further avoid germs the milker should wear clean overalls, should\r\nhave clean hands, and, above all, should never wet his hands with milk.\r\nThis last habit, in addition to being filthy, lessens the keeping power\r\nof the milk. The milker should also moisten the parts of the cow which\r\nare nearest him, so that dust from the cow's sides may not fall into the\r\nmilker's pail. For greater cleanliness and safety many milkmen curry\r\ntheir cows.\r\n\r\nThe first few streams from each teat should be thrown away, because the\r\nteat at its mouth is filled with milk which, having been exposed to the\r\nair, is full of germs, and will do much toward souring the other milk in\r\nthe pail. Barely a gill will be lost by throwing the first drawings\r\naway, and this of the poorest milk too. The increase in the keeping\r\nquality of the milk will much more than repay the small loss. If these\r\nprecautions are taken, the milk will keep several hours or even several\r\ndays longer than milk carelessly handled. By taking these steps to\r\nprevent germs from falling into the milk, a can of milk was once kept\r\nsweet for thirty-one days.\r\n\r\nThe work of the germ in the dairy is not, however, confined to souring\r\nthe milk. Certain kinds of germs give to the different sorts of cheeses\r\ntheir marked flavors and to butter its flavor. If the right germ is\r\npresent, cheese or butter gets a proper flavor. Sometimes undesirable\r\ngerms gain entrance and give flavors that we do not like. Such germs\r\nproduce cheese or butter diseases. \"Bitter butter\" is one of these\r\ndiseases. To keep out all unpleasant meddlers, thoroughly cleanse and\r\nscald every utensil.\r\n\r\n     EXERCISE\r\n\r\n     What causes milk to sour? Why do unclean utensils affect the milk?\r\n     How should milk be cared for to prevent its souring? Prepare two\r\n     samples, one carefully, the other carelessly. Place them side by\r\n     side. Which keeps longer? Why?\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LXIII. THE BABCOCK MILK-TESTER\r\n\r\nIt is not sufficient for a farmer or a dairyman to know how much milk\r\neach of his cows yields. He should also know how rich the milk is in\r\nbutter-fat. Wide-awake makers of butter and cheese now buy milk, not by\r\nthe pound or by the gallon, but by the amount of butter-fat contained in\r\neach pound or gallon of milk. A gallon of milk containing four and a\r\nhalf per cent of fat will consequently be worth more than a gallon\r\ncontaining only three per cent of fat. So it may happen that a cow\r\ngiving only two gallons of milk may pay a butter-maker more than a cow\r\ngiving three gallons of milk. Of course it is easy to weigh or measure\r\nthe quantity of milk given by a cow, and most milkers keep this record;\r\nbut until recent years there was no way to find out the amount of fat in\r\na cow's milk except by a slow and costly chemical test. Dairymen could\r\nonly guess at the richness of milk.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Dr. S. M. Babcock of the Wisconsin Experiment Station invented a\r\nwonderful little machine that quickly and cheaply measures the fat in\r\nmilk. Few machines are more useful. So desirous was Dr. Babcock of\r\nhelping the farmers that he would not add to the cost of his machine by\r\ntaking out a patent on his invention. His only reward has been the fame\r\nwon by the invention of the machine, which bears his name. This most\r\nuseful tester is now made in various sizes so that every handler of milk\r\nmay buy one suited to his needs and do his own testing at very little\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the machine is very simple. Suppose that the members of\r\nthe class studying this book have been asked to take a Babcock machine\r\nand test the milk of a small herd of cows. They can readily do so by\r\nfollowing these directions:\r\n\r\nWhile the milk is still warm from the first cow to be tested, mix it\r\nthoroughly by pouring it at least four times from one vessel to another.\r\nA few ounces of this mixed milk is then taken for a sample, and\r\ncarefully marked with the name of the cow. A number is also put on the\r\nsample, and both the cow's name and the number entered in a notebook. A\r\nsmall glass instrument, called a pipette, comes with each machine. Put\r\none end of the pipette into the milk sample and the other end into the\r\nmouth. Suck milk into the pipette until the milk comes up to the mark on\r\nthe side of the pipette. As soon as the mark is reached, withdraw the\r\npipette from the mouth and quickly press the forefinger on the mouth\r\nend. The pressure of the finger will keep the milk from running out.\r\nThen put the lower end of the pipette into one of the small long-necked\r\nbottles of the machine, and, lifting the finger, allow the milk to flow\r\ngently into the bottle. Expel all the milk by blowing through the\r\npipette.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to add a strong, biting acid known as sulphuric acid to\r\nthe test-bottle into which you have just put the milk. A glass marked to\r\nshow just how much acid to use also comes with the machine. Fill this\r\nglass measure to the mark. Then pour the acid carefully into the\r\ntest-bottle. Be sure not to drop any of the acid on your hands or your\r\nclothes. As the acid is heavier than the milk, it will sink to the\r\nbottom of the bottle. With a gentle whirling motion, shake the bottle\r\nuntil the two fluids are thoroughly mixed. The mixture will turn a dark\r\nbrown and become very warm.\r\n\r\nNow fill the other bottles in the same way with samples drawn from\r\ndifferent cows. Treat all the samples precisely as you did the first. Do\r\nnot forget to put on each sample the name of the cow giving the milk and\r\non each test-bottle a number corresponding to the name of the cow.\r\n\r\nYou are now ready to put the test-bottles in the sockets of the machine.\r\nArrange the bottles in the sockets so that the whirling frame of the\r\nmachine will be balanced. Fit the cover on the machine and turn the\r\nhandle slowly. Gradually gain in speed until the machine is whirled\r\nrapidly. Continue the turning for about seven minutes at the speed\r\nstated in the book of directions.\r\n\r\nAfter this first turning is finished, pour enough hot water into each\r\ntest-bottle to cause the fat to rise to the neck of the bottle. Re-cover\r\nthe machine and turn for one minute. Again add hot water to each bottle\r\nuntil all the fat rises into the neck of the bottle and again turn one\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nThere remains now only the reading of the record. On the neck of each\r\nbottle there are marks to measure the amount of fat. If the fat inside\r\nthe tube reaches only from the lowest mark to the second mark, then\r\nthere is only one per cent of fat in this cow's milk. This means that\r\nthe owner of the cow gets only one pound of butter-fat from each\r\nhundred pounds of her milk. Such a cow would not be at all profitable to\r\na butter-seller. If the fat in another test-bottle reaches from the\r\nlowest mark to the fourth mark, then you put in your record-book that\r\nthis cow's milk contains four per cent of butter-fat. This record shows\r\nthat the second cow's milk yields four pounds of fat to every hundred\r\npounds of milk. This cow is three times more valuable to a butter-maker\r\nthan the first cow. In the same way add one more per cent for each\r\nhigher mark reached by the fat. Four and one-half per cent is a good\r\nrecord for a cow to make. Some cows yield as high as five or six per\r\ncent but they do not generally keep up this record all the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 274. BABCOCK TESTER AND HOW TO USE IT\r\nThe tester, acid, acid measure, test-bottle, and thermometer at bottom;\r\nfilling the pipette on right; adding the acid and measuring the fat at\r\ntop]\r\n\r\nThe Babcock tester shows only the amount of pure butter-fat in the milk.\r\nIt does not tell the exact amount of finished butter which is made from\r\n100 pounds of milk. This is because butter contains a few other things\r\nin addition to pure butter-fat. Finished and salted butter weighs on an\r\naverage about one sixth more than the fat shown by the tester. Hence to\r\nget the exact amount of butter in every 100 pounds of milk, you will\r\nhave to add one sixth to the record shown by the tester. Suppose, for\r\nexample, you took one sample from 600 pounds of milk and that your test\r\nshowed 4 per cent of fat in every 100 pounds of milk. Then, as you had\r\n600 pounds of milk, you would have 24 pounds of butter-fat. This fat,\r\nafter it has been salted and after it has absorbed moisture as butter\r\ndoes, will gain one sixth in weight. As one sixth of 24 is 4, this new 4\r\npounds must be added to the weight of the butter-fat. Hence the 600\r\npounds of milk would produce about 28 pounds of butter.\r\n\r\n     EXERCISE\r\n\r\n     1. Find the number of pounds of butter in 1200 pounds of milk that\r\n     tests 3 per cent of butter-fat.\r\n\r\n     2. A cow yields 4800 pounds of milk in a year. Her milk tests 4 per\r\n     cent of butter-fat. Find the total amount of butter-fat she yields.\r\n     Find also the total amount of butter.\r\n\r\n     3. The milk of two cows was tested: one yielded in a year 6000\r\n     pounds of milk that tested 3 per cent of fat; the other yielded\r\n     5000 pounds that tested 4 per cent. Which cow yielded the more\r\n     butter-fat? What was the money value of the butter produced by each\r\n     if butter-fat is worth twenty-five cents a pound?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LXIV. GROWING FEED STUFFS ON THE FARM\r\n\r\nEconomy in raising live stock demands the production of all \"roughness\"\r\nor roughage materials on the farm. By roughness, or roughage, of course\r\nyou understand that bulky food, like hay, grass, clover, stover, etc.,\r\nis meant. It is possible to purchase all roughage materials and yet make\r\na financial success of growing farm animals, but this certainly is not\r\nthe surest way to succeed. Every farm should raise all its feed stuffs.\r\nIn deciding what forage and grain crops to grow we should decide:\r\n\r\n  1. The crops best suited to our soil and climate.\r\n  2. The crops best suited to our line of business.\r\n  3. The crops that will give us the most protein.\r\n  4. The crops that produce the most.\r\n  5. The crops that will keep our soil in the best condition.\r\n\r\n1. _The crops best suited to our soil and climate._ Farm crops, as every\r\nchild of the farm knows, are not equally adapted to all soils and\r\nclimates. Cotton cannot be produced where the climate is cool and the\r\nseasons short. Timothy and blue grass are most productive on cool,\r\nlimestone soils. Cowpeas demand warm, dry soils. But in spite of\r\nclimatic limitations, Nature has been generous in the wide variety of\r\nforage she has given us.\r\n\r\nOur aim should be to make the best use of what we have, to improve by\r\nselection and care those kinds best adapted to our soil and climate, and\r\nto secure, by better methods of growing and curing, the greatest yields\r\nat the least possible cost.\r\n\r\n2. _The crops best suited to our line of business._ A farmer necessarily\r\nbecomes more or less of a specialist; he gathers those kinds of live\r\nstock about him which he likes best and which he finds the most\r\nprofitable. He should, on his farm, select for his main crops those that\r\nhe can grow with the greatest pleasure and with the greatest profit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 275. FILLING THE BARN WITH ROUGHAGE FROM THE FARM]\r\n\r\nThe successful railroad manager determines by practical experience what\r\ndistances his engines and crews ought to run in a day, what coal is most\r\neconomical for his engines, what schedules best suit the needs of his\r\nroad, what trains pay him best. These and a thousand and one other\r\nmatters are settled by the special needs of his road.\r\n\r\nOught the man who wants to make his farm pay be less prudent and less\r\nfar-sighted? Should not his past failures and his past triumphs decide\r\nhis future? If he be a dairy farmer, ought he not by practical tests to\r\nsettle for himself not only what crops are most at home on his land but\r\nalso what crops in his circumstances yield him the largest returns in\r\nmilk and butter? If swine-raising be his business, how long ought he to\r\nguess what crop on his land yields him the greatest amount of hog food?\r\nShould a colt be fed on one kind of forage when the land that produced\r\nthat forage would produce twice as much equally good forage of another\r\nkind? All these questions the prudent farmer should answer promptly and\r\nin the light of wise experiments.\r\n\r\n3. _The crops that will give us the most protein._ It is the farmer's\r\nbusiness to grow all the grass and forage that his farm animals need. He\r\nought never to be obliged to purchase a bale of forage. Moreover, he\r\nshould grow mainly those crops that are rich in protein materials, for\r\nexample, cowpeas, alfalfa, and clover. If such crops are produced on the\r\nfarm, there will be little need of buying so much cotton-seed meal,\r\ncorn, and bran for feeding purposes.\r\n\r\n4. _The crops that produce the most._ We often call a crop a crop\r\nwithout considering how much it yields. This is a mistake. We ought to\r\ngrow, when we have choice of two crops, the one that is the best and the\r\nmost productive on the farm. Average corn, for instance, yields on an\r\nacre at least twice the quantity of feeding-material that timothy does.\r\n\r\n5. _The crops that will keep our soil in the best condition._ A good\r\nfarmer should always be thinking of how to improve his soil. He wants\r\nhis land to support him and to maintain his children after he is dead.\r\n\r\nSince cowpeas, clover, and alfalfa add atmospheric nitrogen to the soil\r\nand at the same time are the best feeding-materials, it follows that\r\nthese crops should hold an important place in every system of\r\ncrop-rotation. By proper rotating, by proper terracing, and by proper\r\ndrainage, land may be made to retain its fertility for generations.\r\n\r\n     EXERCISE\r\n\r\n     1. Why are cowpeas, clover, and alfalfa so important to the farmer?\r\n\r\n     2. What is meant by the protein of a food?\r\n\r\n     3. Why is it better to feed the farm crops to animals on the farm\r\n     rather than to sell these crops?\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LXV. FARM TOOLS AND MACHINES\r\n\r\nThe drudgery of farm life is being lessened from year to year by the\r\ninvention or improvement of farm tools and machines. Perhaps some of you\r\nknow how tiresome was the old up-and-down churn dasher that has now\r\ngenerally given place to the \"quick-coming\" churns. The toothed,\r\nhorse-drawn cultivator has nearly displaced \"the man with the hoe,\"\r\nwhile the scythe, slow and back-breaking, is everywhere getting out of\r\nthe way of the mowing-machine and the horserake. The old heavy,\r\nsweat-drawing grain-cradle is slinking into the backwoods, and in its\r\nplace we have the horse-drawn or steam-drawn harvester that cuts and\r\nbinds the grain, and even threshes and measures it at one operation.\r\nInstead of the plowman's wearily making one furrow at a time, the\r\ngang-plows of the plains cut many furrows at one time, and instead of\r\nwalking the plowman rides. The shredder and husker turns the hitherto\r\nuseless cornstalk into food, and at the same time husks, or shucks, the\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nThe farmer of the future must know three things well: first, what\r\nmachines he can profitably use; second, how to manage these machines;\r\nthird, how to care for these machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 276. PROPERLY PROTECTED TOOLS AND MACHINES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 277. UNPROTECTED TOOLS AND MACHINES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 278. THE HARVESTER AT WORK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 279. IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT]\r\n\r\nThe machinery that makes farming so much more economical and that makes\r\nthe farmer's life so much easier and more comfortable is too complicated\r\nto be put into the hands of bunglers who will soon destroy it, and it is\r\ntoo costly to be left in the fields or under trees to rust and rot.\r\n\r\nIf it is not convenient for every farmer to have a separate tool-house,\r\nhe should at least set apart a room in his barn, or a shed for storing\r\nhis tools and machines. As soon as a plow, harrow, cultivator--indeed\r\nany tool or machine--has finished its share of work for the season, it\r\nshould receive whatever attention it needs to prevent rusting, and\r\nshould be carefully housed.\r\n\r\nSuch care, which is neither costly nor burdensome, will add many years\r\nto the life of a machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LXVI. LIMING THE LAND\r\n\r\nOccasionally, when a cook puts too much vinegar in a salad, the dish\r\nbecomes so sour that it is unfit to eat. The vinegar which the cook uses\r\nbelongs to a large group of compounds known as acids. The acids are\r\ncommon in nature. They have the power not only of making salads sour but\r\nalso of making land sour. Frequently land becomes so sour from acids\r\nforming in it that it will not bear its usual crops. The acids must then\r\nbe removed or the land will become useless.\r\n\r\nThe land may be soured in several ways. Whenever a large amount of\r\nvegetable matter decays in land, acids are formed, and at times sourness\r\nof the soil results. Often soils sour because they are not well drained\r\nor because, from lack of proper tillage, air cannot make its way into\r\nthe soil. Sometimes all these causes may combine to produce sourness.\r\nSince most crops cannot thrive on very sour soil, the farmer must find\r\nsome method of making his land sweet again.\r\n\r\nSo far as we now know, liming the land is the cheapest and surest way of\r\novercoming the sourness. In addition to sweetening the soil by\r\novercoming the acids, lime aids the land in other ways: it quickens the\r\ngrowth of helpful bacteria; it loosens stiff, heavy clay soils and\r\nthereby fits them for easier tillage; it indirectly sets free the potash\r\nand phosphoric acid so much needed by plants; and it increases the\r\ncapillarity of soils.\r\n\r\nHowever, too much must not be expected of lime. Often a farmer's yield\r\nis so increased after he has scattered lime over his fields that he\r\nthinks that lime alone will keep his land fertile. This belief explains\r\nthe saying, \"Lime enriches the father but beggars the son.\" The\r\ncontinued use of lime without other fertilization will indeed leave poor\r\nland for the son. Lime is just as necessary to plant growth as the\r\npotash and nitrogen and phosphoric acid about which we hear so much, but\r\nit cannot take the place of these plant foods. Its duty is to aid, not\r\nto displace them.\r\n\r\nWe can tell by the taste when salads are too sour; it is more difficult\r\nto find out whether land is sour. There are, however, some methods that\r\nwill help to determine the sourness of the soil.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, if land is unusually sour, you can determine this\r\nfact by a simple test. Buy a pennyworth of blue litmus paper from a drug\r\nstore. Mix some of the suspected soil with a little water and bury the\r\nlitmus paper in the mixture. If the paper turns red the soil is sour.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the leguminous crops are fond of lime. Clover and\r\nvetch remove so much lime from the soil that they are often called lime\r\nplants. If clover and vetch refuse to grow on land on which they\r\nformerly flourished, it is generally, though not always, a sign that the\r\nland needs lime.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, when water grasses and certain weeds spring up on\r\nland, that land is usually acid, and lime will be helpful. Moreover,\r\nfields adjoining land on which cranberries, raspberries, blackberries,\r\nor gallberries are growing wild, may always be suspected of more or less\r\nsourness.\r\n\r\nFour forms of lime are used on land. These, each called by different\r\nnames, are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, quicklime, which is also called burnt lime, caustic lime,\r\nbuilders' lime, rock lime, and unslaked lime.\r\n\r\nSecond, air-slaked lime, which is also known as carbonate of lime,\r\nagricultural lime, marl, and limestone.\r\n\r\nThird, water-slaked, or hydrated, lime.\r\n\r\nFourth, land plaster, or gypsum. This form of lime is known to the\r\nchemists as sulphate of lime. Do not forget that this last form is never\r\nto be used on sour lands. We shall therefore not consider it further.\r\n\r\nAir-slaked lime is simply quicklime which has taken from the air a gas\r\ncalled carbon dioxide. This is the same gas that you breathe out from\r\nyour lungs.\r\n\r\nWater-slaked lime is quicklime to which water has been added. In other\r\nwords, both of these are merely weakened forms of quicklime. One hundred\r\npounds of quicklime is equal in richness to 132 pounds of water-slaked\r\nlime and to 178 pounds of air-slaked lime. These figures should be\r\nremembered by a farmer when he is buying lime. If he can buy a fair\r\ngrade of quicklime delivered at his railway station for $5.00 a ton, he\r\ncannot afford to pay more than $3.75 a ton for water-slaked lime, nor\r\nmore than $2.75 for air-slaked lime of equal grade. Quicklime should\r\nalways be slaked before it is applied to the soil.\r\n\r\nAs a rule lime should be spread broadcast and then harrowed or disked\r\nthoroughly into the soil. This is best done after the ground has been\r\nplowed. For pastures or meadows air-slaked lime is used as a\r\ntop-dressing. When air-slaked lime is used it may be spread broadcast in\r\nthe spring; the other forms should be applied in the fall or in the\r\nearly winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LXVII. BIRDS\r\n\r\nWhat do birds do in the world? is an important question for us to think\r\nabout. First, we must gain by observation and by personal acquaintance\r\nwith the living birds a knowledge of their work and their way of doing\r\nit. In getting this knowledge, let us also consider what we can do for\r\nour birds to render their work as complete and effective as possible.\r\n\r\nThink of what the birds are doing on every farm, in every garden, and\r\nabout every home in the land. Think of the millions of beautiful wings,\r\nof the graceful and attractive figures, of the cunning nests, and of the\r\nsinging throats! Do you think that the whole service of the birds is to\r\nbe beautiful, to sing charmingly, and to rear their little ones? By no\r\nmeans is this their chief service to man. Aside from these services the\r\ngreatest work of birds is to destroy insects. It is one of the wise\r\nprovisions of nature that many of the most brilliantly winged and most\r\nenchanting songsters are our most practical friends.\r\n\r\nNot all birds feed on insects and animals; but even those that eat but a\r\nsmall amount of insect food may still destroy insects that would have\r\ndamaged fruit and crops much more than the birds themselves do.\r\n\r\nAs to their food, birds are divided into three general classes. First,\r\nthose that live wholly or almost wholly on insects. These are called\r\ninsectivorous birds. Chief among these are the warblers, cuckoos,\r\nswallows, martins, flycatchers, nighthawks, whippoorwills, swifts, and\r\nhumming-birds. We cannot have too many of these birds. They should be\r\nencouraged and protected. They should be supplied with shelter and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBirds of the second class feed by preference on fruits, nuts, and grain.\r\nThe bluebird, robin, wood thrush, mocking-bird, catbird, chickadee,\r\ncedar-bird, meadow lark, oriole, jay, crow, and woodpecker belong to\r\nthis group. These birds never fail to perform a service for us by\r\ndevouring many weed seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 280. A KINGBIRD]\r\n\r\nThe third class is known as the hard-billed birds. It includes those\r\nbirds which live principally on seeds and grain--the canary, goldfinch,\r\nsparrow, and some others.\r\n\r\nBirds that come early, like the bluebird, robin, and redwing, are of\r\nspecial service in destroying insects before the insects lay their eggs\r\nfor the season.\r\n\r\nThe robins on the lawn search out the caterpillars and cutworms. The\r\nchipping sparrow and the wren in the shrubbery look out for all kinds of\r\ninsects. They watch over the orchard and feed freely on the enemies of\r\nthe apple and other fruit trees. The trunks of these trees are often\r\nattacked by borers, which gnaw holes in the bark and wood, and often\r\ncause the death of the trees. The woodpeckers hunt for these appetizing\r\nborers and by means of their barbed tongues bring them from their\r\nhiding-places. On the outside of the bark of the trunk and branches the\r\nbark lice work. These are devoured by the nuthatches, creepers, and\r\nchickadees.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter the bark is the hiding-place for hibernating insects,\r\nwhich, like plant lice, feed in summer on the leaves. Throughout the\r\nwinter a single chickadee will destroy great numbers of the eggs of the\r\ncankerworm moth and of the plant louse. The blackbirds, meadow larks,\r\ncrows, quail, and sparrows are the great protectors of the meadow and\r\nfield crops. These birds feed on the army worms and cutworms that do so\r\nmuch injury to the young shoots; they also destroy the chinch bug and\r\nthe grasshopper, both of which feed on cultivated plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 281. A WARBLER]\r\n\r\nA count of all the different kinds of animals shows that insects make up\r\nnine tenths of them. Hence it is easy to see that if something did not\r\ncheck their increase they would soon almost overrun the earth. Our\r\nforests and orchards furnish homes and breeding-places for most of these\r\ninsects. Suppose the injurious insects were allowed to multiply\r\nunchecked in the forests, their numbers would so increase that they\r\nwould invade our fields and create as much terror among the farmers as\r\nthey did in Pharaoh's Egypt. The birds are the only direct friends man\r\nhas to destroy these harmful insects. What benefactors, then, these\r\nlittle feathered neighbors are!\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that a bird will devour thirty insects daily. Even\r\nin a widely extended forest region a very few birds to the acre, if they\r\nkept up this rate, would daily destroy many bushels of insects that\r\nwould play havoc with the neighboring orchards and fields.\r\n\r\nDo not imagine, however, that to destroy insects is the only use of\r\nbirds. The day is far more delightful when the birds sing, and when we\r\nsee them flit in and out, giving us a glimpse now and then of their\r\npretty coats and quaint ways. By giving them a home we can surround\r\nourselves with many birds, sweet of song and brilliant of plumage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 282. THE HAIRY WOODPECKER]\r\n\r\nIf the birds felt that man were a friend and not a foe, they would often\r\nturn to him for protection. During times of severe storm, extreme\r\ndrought, or scarcity of food, if the birds were sufficiently tamed to\r\ncome to man as their friend, as they do in rare cases now, a little food\r\nand shelter might tide them over the hard time and their service\r\nafterwards would repay the outlay a thousandfold. If the boys in your\r\nfamilies would build bird-houses about the house and barn and in shade\r\ntrees, they might save yearly a great number of birds. In building these\r\nplaces of shelter and comfort, due care must be taken to keep them\r\nclear of English sparrows and out of the reach of cats and bird-dogs.\r\n\r\nWhatever we do to attract the birds to make homes on the premises must\r\nbe done at the right time and in the right way. Think out carefully what\r\nmaterials to provide for them. Bits of string, linen, cotton, yarn, tow\r\nand other waste material, all help to induce a pair to build in the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 283. PROTECTING OUR FRIENDS]\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting study--the preparation of homes for the birds.\r\nTrees may be pruned to make inviting crotches. A tangled, overgrown\r\ncorner in the garden will invite some birds to nest.\r\n\r\nWrens, bluebirds, chickadees, martins, and some other varieties are all\r\nglad to set up housekeeping in man-made houses. The proper size for a\r\nbird-room is easily remembered. Give each room six square inches of\r\nfloor space and make it eight inches high. Old, weathered boards should\r\nbe used; or, if paint is employed, a dull color to resemble an old\r\ntree-trunk will be most inviting. A single opening near the top should\r\nbe made two inches in diameter for the larger birds; but if the house is\r\nto be headquarters for the wren, a one-inch opening is quite large\r\nenough, and the small door serves all the better to keep out English\r\nsparrows.\r\n\r\nThe barn attic should be turned over to the swallows. Small holes may be\r\ncut high up in the gables and left open during the time that the\r\nswallows remain with us. They will more than pay for shelter by the good\r\nwork they do in ridding the barn of flies, gnats, and mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LXVIII. FARMING ON DRY LANDS\r\n\r\nAlmost in the center of the western half of our continent there is a\r\nvast area in which very little rain falls. This section includes nearly\r\nthree hundred million acres of land. It stretches from Canada on the\r\nnorth into Texas on the south, and from the Missouri River (including\r\nthe Dakotas and western Minnesota) on the east to the Rocky Mountains on\r\nthe west. In this great area farming has to be done with little water.\r\nThis sort of farming is therefore called \"dry-farming.\"\r\n\r\nThe soil in this section is as a rule very fertile. Therefore the\r\ndifference between farming in this dry belt and farming in most of the\r\nother sections of our country is a difference mainly due to a lack of\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nAs water is so scarce in this region two things are of the utmost\r\nimportance: first, to save all the rain as it falls; second, to save all\r\nthe water after it has fallen. To save the falling rain it is necessary\r\nfor the ground to be in such a condition that none of the much-needed\r\nrain may run off. Every drop should go into the soil. Hence the farmer\r\nshould never allow his top soil to harden into a crust. Such a crust\r\nwill keep the rain from sinking into the thirsty soil. Moreover the soil\r\nshould be deeply plowed. The deeper the soil the more water it can hold.\r\nThe land should also be kept as porous as possible, for water enters a\r\nporous soil freely. The addition of humus in the form of vegetable\r\nmanures will keep the soil in the porous condition needed. Second, after\r\nthe water has entered the soil it is important to hold it there so that\r\nit may supply the growing crops. If the land is allowed to remain\r\nuntilled after a rain or during a hot spell, the water in it will\r\nevaporate too rapidly and thus the soil, like a well, will go dry too\r\nsoon. To prevent this the top soil should be stirred frequently with a\r\ndisk or smoothing harrow. This stirring will form a mulch of dry soil on\r\nthe surface, and this will hold the water. Other forms of mulch have\r\nbeen suggested, but the soil mulch is the only practical one. It must be\r\nborne in mind that this surface cultivation must be regularly kept up if\r\nthe moisture is to be retained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 284. THE DISK HARROW]\r\n\r\nSome experiments in wheat-growing have shown how readily water might be\r\nsaved if plowing were done at the right time. Wheat sowed on land that\r\nwas plowed as soon as the summer crops were taken off yielded a very\r\nmuch larger return than wheat sowed on land that remained untilled for\r\nsome time after the summer crops were gathered. This difference in yield\r\non lands of the same fertility was due to the fact that the early\r\nplowing enabled the land to take up a sufficient quantity of moisture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 285. RED KAFIR CORN IN SHOCK]\r\n\r\nIn addition to a vigilant catching and saving of water, the farmer in\r\nthese dry climates must give his land the same careful attention that\r\nlands in other regions need. The seed-bed should be most carefully\r\nprepared. It should be deep, porous, and excellent in tilth. During the\r\ngrowing season all crops should be frequently cultivated. The harrow,\r\nthe cultivator, and the plow should be kept busy. The soil should be\r\nkept abundantly supplied with humus.\r\n\r\nSome crops need a little different management in dry-farming. Corn, for\r\nexample, does best when it is listed; that is, planted so that it will\r\ncome up three or four inches beneath the surface. If planted in this\r\nway, it roots better, stands up better, and requires less work.\r\n\r\nJust as breeders study what animals are best for their climates, so\r\nfarmers in the dry belt should study what crops are best suited to their\r\nlands. Some crops, like the sorghums and Kafir corn, are peculiarly at\r\nhome in scantily watered lands. Others do not thrive. Experience is the\r\nonly sure guide to the proper selection.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, farmers can grow good crops in these lands only when\r\nfour things are done: first, the land must be thoroughly tilled so that\r\nwater can freely enter the soil; second, the land must be frequently\r\ncultivated so that the water will be kept in the soil; third, the crops\r\nmust be properly rotated so as to use to best advantage the food and\r\nwater supply; fourth, humus must be freely supplied so as to keep the\r\nsoil in the best possible condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LXIX. IRRIGATION\r\n\r\nIrrigation is the name given to the plan of supplying water in large\r\nquantities to growing crops. Since the dawn of history this practice has\r\nbeen more or less followed in Asia, in Africa, and in Europe. The\r\nSpanish settlers in the southwestern part of America were probably the\r\nfirst to introduce this custom into our country. In New Mexico there is\r\nan irrigating trench that has been in constant use for three hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 286. PUMPING WATER FOR IRRIGATION]\r\n\r\nThe most common source of water for irrigating purposes is a river or a\r\nsmaller stream. Artesian wells are used in some parts of the country.\r\nWindmills are sometimes used when only a small supply of water is\r\nneeded. Engines, hydraulic rams, and water-wheels are also employed. The\r\nwater-wheel is one of the oldest and one of the most useful methods of\r\nraising water from streams. There are thousands of these in use in the\r\ndry regions of the West. Small buckets are fastened to a large wheel,\r\nwhich is turned by the current of a stream. As the wheel turns, the\r\nbuckets are filled, raised, and then emptied into a trough called a\r\nflume. The water flows through the flume into the irrigating ditches,\r\nwhich distribute it as it is needed in the fields. In some parts of\r\nCalifornia and other comparatively dry sections, wells are sunk in or\r\nnear the beds of underground streams, and then the water is pumped into\r\nditches which convey it to the fields to be irrigated.\r\n\r\nEngines are often used for pumping water from streams and transferring\r\nit to ditches or canals. The canals distribute the water over the land\r\nor over the growing crops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 287. THE MAIN DITCH OF AN IRRIGATION PLANT]\r\n\r\nNone of these methods, however, can be used for watering very large\r\nareas of land. Hence, as the value of farm lands increased other methods\r\nwere sought. Shrewd men began to turn longing eyes on the wide stretches\r\nof barren land in the West. They knew that these waste lands, seemingly\r\nso unfertile, would become most fruitful as soon as water was turned on\r\nthem. Could water enough be found? New plans to pen up floods of water\r\nwere prepared, and immense sums were spent in carrying out these plans.\r\nEnormous dams of cemented stone were thrown across the gorges in the\r\nfoothills of the mountains. Behind these solid dams the water from the\r\nrains and the melting snow of the mountains was backed for miles, and\r\nwas at once ready to change barrenness into fruitfulness. The stored\r\nwater is led by means of main canals and cross ditches wherever it is\r\nneeded, and countless acres have been brought under cultivation.\r\n\r\nWater is generally applied either by making furrows for its passage\r\nthrough the fields or by flooding the land. The latter plan is the\r\ncheaper, but it can be used only on level lands. Where the land is\r\nsomewhat irregular a checking system, as it is called, is used to\r\ndistribute the water. It is taken from check to check until the entire\r\nfield has been irrigated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 288. THE PROCESS OF IRRIGATING CORN]\r\n\r\nThe furrow method is usually employed for fruits and for farm and garden\r\ncrops. In many places the grass and grain crops are now supplied with\r\nwater by furrows instead of by flooding.\r\n\r\nIrrigated lands should be carefully and thoroughly tilled. The water for\r\nirrigation is costly, and should be made to go as far as possible. Good\r\ntillage saves the water. Moreover, all cultivated crops like corn,\r\npotatoes, and orchard and truck crops ought to be cultivated frequently\r\nto save the moisture, to keep the soil in fit condition, and to aid the\r\nbacteria in the soil. It was a wise farmer who said, \"One does not need\r\nto grow crops many years in order to learn that nothing can take the\r\nplace of stirring the soil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF IRRIGATING CROPS\r\n\r\n_Tree fruits._ Water is conducted through very narrow furrows from three\r\nto five feet apart, and allowed to sink about four feet deep, and to\r\nspread under the ground. Then the supply is cut off. The object is to\r\nwet the soil deeply, and then by tillage to hold the moisture in the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n_Small fruits._ The common practice is to run water on each side of the\r\nrow until the rows are soaked.\r\n\r\n_Potatoes._ A thorough soaking is given the land before planting-time,\r\nand then no more than is absolutely necessary until blossoming-time.\r\nAfter the blossoms appear keep the soil moist until the crop ripens.\r\n\r\n_Garden crops._ Any method may be employed, but the vital point is to\r\ncultivate the ground as early as it can be worked after it has been\r\nirrigated.\r\n\r\n_Meadows and alfalfa._ Flooding is the most common method in use. The\r\nfirst irrigation comes early in the spring before growth has advanced\r\nmuch, and the successive waterings after the harvesting of each crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LXX. LIFE IN THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\nAs ours is a country in which the people rule, every boy and every girl\r\nought to be trained to take a wide-awake interest in public affairs.\r\nThis training cannot begin too early in life. A wise old man once said,\r\n\"In a republic you ought to begin to train a child for good citizenship\r\non the day of its birth.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 289. BEAUTY FROM FLOWERS AND GRASS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 290. A COUNTRY ROAD IN MECKLENBURG COUNTY,\r\nNORTH CAROLINA]\r\n\r\nHappy would it be for our nation if all the young people who live in the\r\ncountry could begin their training in good citizenship by becoming\r\nworkers for these four things:\r\n\r\nFirst, attractive country homes.\r\n\r\nSecond, attractive country schoolhouses and school grounds.\r\n\r\nThird, good country schools.\r\n\r\nFourth, good roads.\r\n\r\nIf the thousands on thousands of pupils in our schools would become\r\nactive workers for these things and continue their work through life,\r\nthen, in less than half a century, life in the country would be an\r\nunending delight.\r\n\r\nOne of the problems of our day is how to keep bright, thoughtful,\r\nsociable, ambitious boys and girls contented on the farm. Every step\r\ntaken to make the country home more attractive, to make the school and\r\nits grounds more enjoyable, to make the way easy to the homes of\r\nneighbors, to school, to post-office, and to church, is a step taken\r\ntoward keeping on the farm the very boys and girls who are most apt to\r\nsucceed there.\r\n\r\nNot every man who lives in the country can have a showy or costly home,\r\nbut as long as grass and flowers and vines and trees grow, any man who\r\nwishes can have an attractive house. Not every woman who is to spend a\r\nlifetime at the head of a rural home can have a luxuriously furnished\r\nhome, but any woman who is willing to take a little trouble can have a\r\ncozy, tastefully furnished home--a home fitted with the conveniences\r\nthat diminish household drudgery. Even in this day of cheap literature,\r\nall parents cannot fill their children's home with papers, magazines,\r\nand books, but by means of school and Sunday-school libraries, by means\r\nof circulating book clubs, and by a little self-denial, earnest parents\r\ncan feed hungry minds just as they feed hungry bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE QUEEN OF FLOWERS FOR THE HOME]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 291. AN ATTRACTIVE COUNTRY HOME]\r\n\r\nAgricultural papers that arouse the interest and quicken the thought of\r\nfarm boys by discussing the best, easiest, and cheapest ways of farming;\r\njournals full of dainty suggestions for household adornment and comfort;\r\nillustrated papers and magazines that amuse and cheer every member of\r\nthe family; books that rest tired bodies and open and strengthen growing\r\nminds--all of these are so cheap that the money reserved from the sale\r\nof one hog will keep a family fairly supplied for a year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  FIG. 292. AN UNIMPROVED SCHOOLHOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 293. AN IMPROVED SCHOOLHOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 294. THE SAME ROAD AFTER AND BEFORE IMPROVEMENT]\r\n\r\nIf the parents, teachers, and pupils of a school join hands, an\r\nunsightly, ill-furnished, ill-lighted, and ill-ventilated school-house\r\ncan at small cost be changed into one of comfort and beauty. In many\r\nplaces pupils have persuaded their parents to form clubs to beautify the\r\nschool grounds. Each father sends a man or a man with a plow once or\r\ntwice a year to work a day on the grounds. Stumps are removed, trees\r\ntrimmed, drains put in, grass sowed, flowers, shrubbery, vines, and\r\ntrees planted, and the grounds tastefully laid off. Thus at scarcely\r\nnoticeable money cost a rough and unsightly school ground gives place to\r\na charming school yard. Cannot the pupils in every school in which this\r\nbook is studied get their parents to form such a club, and make their\r\nschool ground a silent teacher of neatness and beauty?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 295. WASHINGTON'S COUNTRY HOME]\r\n\r\nLife in the country will never be as attractive as it ought to be until\r\nall the roads are improved. Winter-washed roads, penning young people\r\nin their own homes for many months each year and destroying so many of\r\nthe innocent pleasures of youth, build towns and cities out of the wreck\r\nof country homes. Can young people who love their country and their\r\ncountry homes engage in a nobler crusade than a crusade for improved\r\nhighways?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRAYING MIXTURES\r\n\r\nFOR BITING INSECTS\r\n\r\nDRY PARIS GREEN\r\n\r\n  Paris green          1 lb.\r\n  Lime or flour  4 to 16 lb.\r\n\r\nWET PARIS GREEN\r\n\r\n  Paris green  1/4 to   2 lb.\r\n  Lime         1/4 to 1/2 lb.\r\n  Water               50 gal.\r\n\r\nFOR SOFT-BODIED SUCKING INSECTS\r\n\r\nKEROSENE EMULSION\r\n\r\n  Hard soap (in fine shavings) 1/2 lb.\r\n  Soft water                    1 gal.\r\n  Kerosene                      2 gal.\r\n\r\nDissolve soap in boiling water, add kerosene to the hot water, churn\r\nwith spraying pump for at least ten minutes, until the mixture changes\r\nto a creamy, then to a soft, butterlike, mass. This gives three gallons\r\nof 66-per-cent oil emulsion, which may be diluted to the strength\r\ndesired. To get 15-per-cent oil emulsion add ten and one-half gallons of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nFOR FUNGOUS DISEASES\r\n\r\nCOPPER SULPHATE\r\n\r\n  Copper sulphate 1 lb.\r\n  Water   18 to 25 gal.\r\n\r\nUse only before foliage opens, to kill wintering spores.\r\n\r\nBORDEAUX MIXTURE\r\n\r\n  Copper sulphate (bluestone) 4 to 5 lb.\r\n  Lime (good, unslaked)       5 to 6 lb.\r\n  Water                          50 gal.\r\n\r\nDissolve the copper sulphate (bluestone) in twenty-five gallons of\r\nwater. Slake the lime slowly so as to get a smooth, thick cream. Never\r\ncover the lime with too much water. After thorough slaking add\r\ntwenty-five gallons of water. When the lime and the bluestone have\r\ndissolved, pour the two liquids into a third vessel. Be sure that each\r\nstream mixes with the other before either enters the vessel. Strain\r\nthrough a coarse cloth.\r\n\r\nMix fresh for each time. Use for molds and fungi generally. Apply in\r\nfine spray with a good nozzle.\r\n\r\nBORDEAUX-PARIS-GREEN MIXTURE\r\n\r\n  Ordinary Bordeaux mixture 50 gal.\r\n  Paris green        4 oz. to 2 lb.\r\n\r\nUse for both fungi and insects on apple, potato, etc.\r\n\r\nBORDEAUX-ARSENATE-OF-LEAD MIXTURE\r\n\r\n  Ordinary Bordeaux mixture  50 gal.\r\n  Arsenate of lead        2 to 3 lb.\r\n\r\nUsed for fungous and insect enemies of the potato, and of the apple when\r\nbitter rot is troublesome.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL LIME-SULPHUR ARSENATE OF LEAD\r\n\r\n  Commercial lime-sulphur 1-1/2 gal.\r\n  Arsenate of lead        2 to 3 lb.\r\n  Water                      50 gal.\r\n\r\nUse for spraying apples.\r\n\r\nAMMONIACAL COPPER CARBONATE\r\n\r\n  Copper carbonate          5 oz.\r\n  Ammonia (26 deg. Baume) about 3 pt.\r\n  Water                   50 gal.\r\n\r\nDissolve the copper carbonate in the smallest possible amount of\r\nammonia. This solution may be kept in stock and diluted to the proper\r\nstrength as needed.\r\n\r\nUse this instead of the Bordeaux mixture after the fruit has reached\r\nhalf or two thirds of the mature size. It leaves no spots as does the\r\nlime-sulphur wash or the Bordeaux mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRAYS FOR BOTH FUNGOUS AND INSECT PESTS\r\n\r\nHOME-MADE LIME-SULPHUR WASH\r\n\r\n  Lime     20 lb.\r\n  Sulphur  15 lb.\r\n  Water   50 gal.\r\n\r\nThe lime, the sulphur, and about half of the water required are boiled\r\ntogether for forty-five minutes in a kettle over a fire, or in a barrel\r\nor other suitable tank by steam, strained, and then diluted to 50\r\ngallons. This is the wash regularly used against the San Jose scale. It\r\nmay be substituted for Bordeaux mixture when spraying trees in the\r\ndormant state. Commercial lime-sulphur may also be used in place of this\r\nhomemade wash. Use one gallon of the commercial lime-sulphur to nine\r\ngallons of water in the dormant season.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELF-BOILED LIME-SULPHUR WASH\r\n\r\nThe self-boiled lime-sulphur wash is a combination of lime and sulphur\r\nboiled only by the heat of the slaking lime, and is used chiefly for\r\nsummer spraying on peaches, plums, cherries, etc. as a substitute for\r\nthe Bordeaux mixture.\r\n\r\n  Lime         8 lb.\r\n  Sulphur 6 to 8 lb.\r\n  Water      50 gal.\r\n\r\nThe lime should be placed in a barrel and enough water poured on it to\r\nstart it slaking and to keep the sulphur off the bottom of the barrel.\r\nThe sulphur, which should first be worked through a sieve to break up\r\nthe lumps, may then be added, and, finally, enough water to slake the\r\nlime into a paste. Considerable stirring is necessary to prevent caking\r\non the bottom. After the violent boiling which accompanies the slaking\r\nof the lime is over, the mixture should be diluted ready for use, or at\r\nleast enough cold water added to stop the cooking. From five to fifteen\r\nminutes are required for the process. If the hot mass is permitted to\r\nstand undiluted as a thick paste, a liquid is produced that is injurious\r\nto peach foliage and, in some cases, to apple foliage.\r\n\r\nThe mixture should be strained through a sieve of twenty meshes to the\r\ninch in order to remove the coarse particles of lime, but all the\r\nsulphur should be worked through the strainer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo enable young readers to understand the technical words necessarily\r\nused in the text only popular definitions are given.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Abdomen=: the part of an insect lying behind the thorax.\r\n\r\n=Acid=: a chemical name given to many sour substances.
