So begins\r\narchitecture, with the hut as its first step, with the Alhambra, St.\r\nPeter's, the capitol at Washington, as its last. In like fashion the\r\namassing of fact suggests the ordering of fact: when observation is\r\nsufficiently full and varied it comes to the reasons for what it sees.\r\nThe geologist delves from layer to layer of the earth beneath his tread,\r\nhe finds as he compares their fossils that the more recent forms of life\r\nstand highest in the scale of being, that in the main the animals and\r\nplants of one era are more allied to those immediately next than to\r\nthose of remoter times. He thus divines that he is but exploring the\r\nproofs of lineal descent, and with this thought in his mind he finds\r\nthat the collections not only of his own district, but of every other,\r\ntake on a new meaning. The great seers of science do not await every jot\r\nand tittle of evidence in such a case as this. They discern the drift of\r\na fact here, a disclosure there, and with both wisdom and boldness\r\nassume that what they see is but a promise of what shall duly be\r\nrevealed. Thus it was that Darwin early in his studies became convinced\r\nof the truth of organic evolution: the labours of a lifetime of all but\r\nsuperhuman effort, a judicial faculty never exceeded among men, served\r\nonly to confirm his confidence that all the varied forms of life upon\r\nearth have come to be what they are through an intelligible process,\r\nmainly by \"natural selection.\"\r\n\r\nThe present volume offers from the classic pages of Darwin his summary\r\nof the argument of \"The Origin of Species,\" his account of how that book\r\ncame to be written, and his recapitulation of \"The Descent of Man.\" All\r\nthis affords a supreme lesson as to the value of observation with a\r\npurpose. When Darwin was confronted with an organ or trait which puzzled\r\nhim, he was wont to ask, What use can it have had? And always the answer\r\nwas that every new peculiarity of plant, or beast, is seized upon and\r\nheld whenever it confers advantage in the unceasing conflict for place\r\nand food. No hue of scale or plume, no curve of beak or note of song,\r\nbut has served a purpose in the plot of life, or advanced the action in\r\na drama where the penalty for failure is extinction.\r\n\r\nAs Charles Darwin stood first among the naturalists of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, his advocacy of evolution soon wrought conviction among the\r\nthinkers competent to follow his evidence and weigh his arguments. The\r\nopposition to his theories though short was sharp, and here he found a\r\nlieutenant of unflinching courage, of the highest expository power, in\r\nProfessor Huxley. This great teacher came to America in 1876, and\r\ndiscoursed on the ancestry of the horse, as disclosed in fossils then\r\nrecently discovered in the Far West, maintaining that they afforded\r\nunimpeachable proof of organic evolution. His principal lecture is here\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nIn a remarkable field of \"natural selection\" Bates, Wallace and Poulton\r\nhave explained the value of \"mimicry\" as an aid to beasts, birds,\r\ninsects, as they elude their enemies or lie unsuspected on the watch for\r\nprey. The resemblances thus worked out through successive generations\r\nattest the astonishing plasticity of bodily forms, a plasticity which\r\nwould be incredible were not its evidence under our eyes in every\r\nquarter of the globe. Insects have high economic importance as agents of\r\ndestruction: we are learning how to pit one of them against another, so\r\nas to leave a clear field to the farmer and the fruit grower. In this\r\ndepartment a leader is Professor Howard, who contributes a noteworthy\r\nchapter on the successful fight against the pest which threatened with\r\nruin the orange groves of California.\r\n\r\nTo the every-day observer the most enticing field of natural history is\r\nthat in which common flowers and common insects work out their unending\r\nco-partnery. A blossom by its scent, its beauty of tint, allures a moth\r\nor bee and thus, in effect, is able to take flight and find a mate\r\nacross a county so as to perpetuate its race a hundred miles from home.\r\nOur volume closes with a sketch of the singular ties which thus bind\r\ntogether the fortunes of blossom and insect, so that at last the very\r\nform of a flower may be cast in the mould of its winged ally. A word is\r\nalso spoken regarding the singular relations of late detected between\r\nthe world of vegetation and minute forms once deemed parasitic. The pea\r\nand its kindred harbor on their rootlets certain tiny lodgers; the\r\ntenants pay a liberal rent in the form of nitrogen compounds, a striking\r\ninterlacement of interests!\r\n\r\nGEORGE ILES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nDARWIN, CHARLES\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF SPECIES IN SUMMARY\r\n\r\n     Varieties merge gradually into species. Animals tend to\r\n     increase in geometrical ratio. Varieties diverge in consonance\r\n     with diversity of opportunity for life. In the struggle\r\n     for existence those which best accord with their surroundings\r\n     will survive and propagate their kind. Sexual selection\r\n     has put a premium on beauty. The causes which in brief\r\n     periods produce varieties, in long periods give rise to\r\n     species. Instincts, as of the hive bee, are slowly developed.\r\n     Geology supports the theory of Evolution: the changes in time\r\n     in the fossil record are gradual. Geographical distribution\r\n     lends its corroboration: in each region most of the inhabitants\r\n     in every great class are plainly related. A common ancestor\r\n     is suggested when we see the similarity of hand, wing and\r\n     fin. Embryos of birds, reptiles and fish are closely similar\r\n     and unlike adult forms. Slight changes in the course of\r\n     millions of years produce wide divergences.                         3\r\n\r\n\r\nDARWIN, CHARLES\r\n\r\nHOW \"THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES\" CAME TO BE WRITTEN\r\n\r\n     During his voyage on the _Beagle_ Darwin saw fossil\r\n     armadillos like existing species, and on the islands of the\r\n     Galapagos group a gradually increased diversity of species of\r\n     every kind. All this suggested that species gradually become\r\n     modified. Notes gathered of facts bearing on the question.\r\n     Observes that it is the variation between one animal and\r\n     another which gives the breeder his opportunity. Reads\r\n     Malthus on Population, a work which points out the keen\r\n     struggle for existence and that favourable variations tend to\r\n     be preserved. In 1842 draws up a brief abstract of the theory\r\n     of \"natural selection.\" In 1856 begins an elaborate work on\r\n     the same theme, but in 1858, hearing that Wallace has written\r\n     an essay advancing an independent theory of natural selection,\r\n     offers a summary of his argument to the Linnean Society\r\n     of London. Writes \"The Origin of Species,\" which is published\r\n     most successfully, November, 1859.                                  35\r\n\r\n\r\nDARWIN, CHARLES\r\n\r\nTHE DESCENT OF MAN: THE ARGUMENT IN BRIEF\r\n\r\n     Since evolution is probable for all other animals, it is\r\n     probable for man. The human form has so much in common with\r\n     the forms of other animals that community of descent is\r\n     strongly suggested. Man, like other creatures, is subject to\r\n     the struggle for existence. Evidence shows that it is likely\r\n     that man is descended from a tailed and hairy quadruped that\r\n     dwelt in trees. Man's mental power has been the chief factor\r\n     in his advance, especially in his development of language.\r\n     Conscience is due to social instincts, love of approbation,\r\n     memory, imagination and religious feeling.

The lion is\r\n     scarcely visible as he crouches on the sand or among desert\r\n     rocks and stones. Larks, quails and many other birds are so\r\n     tinted and mottled that their detection is difficult. The\r\n     polar bear, living amid ice and snow, is white. Reptiles and\r\n     fish are so coloured as to be almost invisible in the grass\r\n     or gravel where they rest. Many beetles and other insects\r\n     are so like the leaves or bark on which they feed that\r\n     when motionless they cannot be discerned. Some butterflies\r\n     resemble dead, dry or decaying leaves so closely as to elude\r\n     discovery. Every individual better protected by colour than\r\n     others, has a better chance for life, and of transmitting his\r\n     hues. Harmless beetles and flies are so like wasps and bees\r\n     as to be left alone.                                                71\r\n\r\n\r\nHUXLEY, THOMAS H.\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n     The hoof of the horse is simply a greatly enlarged and\r\n     thickened nail: four of his five toes are reduced to mere\r\n     vestiges. His teeth are built of substances of varying\r\n     hardness: they wear away at different rates presenting uneven\r\n     grinding surfaces. Probable descent of the horse, link by\r\n     link, especially as traced in the fossils of North America.\r\n     Evolution has taken a long time: how long the physicist and\r\n     the astronomer must decide.                                        101\r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, LELAND O.\r\n\r\nFIGHTING PESTS WITH INSECT ALLIES\r\n\r\n     A scale insect threatened with ruin the orchards of California.\r\n     Professor C. V. Riley decided that the pest was a native\r\n     of Australia. Mr. A. Hoebele observes in Australia that\r\n     the pest is kept down by ladybirds. These are accordingly\r\n     sent to California where they destroy the scale insect and\r\n     restore prosperity among the fruit-growers. Another pest,\r\n     of olive trees, is devoured by an imported ladybird of\r\n     another species. This plan extended to Portugal and Egypt\r\n     with success.

This he accomplished by virtue\r\n     of the highest gifts of observation, experiment, and\r\n     generalization. His truthfulness, patience, and calmness of\r\n     judgment have never been exceeded by mortal. His works are\r\n     published by D. Appleton & Co., New York, together with his\r\n     \"Life and Letters,\" edited by his son Francis. From \"The\r\n     Origin of Species\" the argument in summary is here given.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent\r\nvarieties, and that each species first existed as a variety, we can see\r\nwhy it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species,\r\ncommonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation, and\r\nvarieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary\r\nlaws. On this same view we can understand how it is that in a region\r\nwhere many species of a genus have been produced, and where they now\r\nflourish, these same species should present many varieties; for where\r\nthe manufactory of species has been active, we might expect, as a\r\ngeneral rule, to find it still in action; and this is the case if\r\nvarieties be incipient species. Moreover, the species of the larger\r\ngenera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient\r\nspecies, retain to a certain degree the character of varieties; for they\r\ndiffer from each other by a less amount of difference than do the\r\nspecies of smaller genera. The closely allied species also of a larger\r\ngenera apparently have restricted ranges, and in their affinities they\r\nare clustered in little groups round other species--in both respects\r\nresembling varieties. These are strange relations on the view that each\r\nspecies was independently created, but are intelligible if each existed\r\nfirst as a variety.\r\n\r\nAs each species tends by its geometrical rate of reproduction to\r\nincrease inordinately in number; and as the modified descendants of each\r\nspecies will be enabled to increase by as much as they become more\r\ndiversified in habits and structure, so as to be able to seize on many\r\nand widely different places in the economy of nature, there will be a\r\nconstant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent\r\noffspring of any one species. Hence, during a long-continued course of\r\nmodification, the slight differences of characteristic of varieties of\r\nthe same species, tend to be augmented into the greater differences\r\ncharacteristic of the species of the same genus. New and improved\r\nvarieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older, less\r\nimproved, and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered to a\r\nlarge extent defined and distinct objects. Dominant species belonging\r\nto the larger groups within each class tend to give birth to new and\r\ndominant forms; so that each large group tends to become still larger,\r\nand at the same time more divergent in character. But as all groups\r\ncannot thus go on increasing in size, for the world would not hold them,\r\nthe more dominant groups beat the less dominant. This tendency in the\r\nlarge groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character,\r\ntogether with the inevitable contingency of much extinction, explains\r\nthe arrangement of all the forms of life in groups subordinate to\r\ngroups, all within a few great classes, which has prevailed throughout\r\nall time. This grand fact of the grouping of all organic beings under\r\nwhat is called the Natural System, is utterly inexplicable on the theory\r\nof creation.\r\n\r\nAs natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive,\r\nfavourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modifications;\r\nit can act only by short and slow steps. Hence, the canon of \"Nature\r\nmakes no leaps,\" which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to\r\nconfirm, is on this theory intelligible. We can see why throughout\r\nnature the same general end is gained by an almost infinite diversity of\r\nmeans, for every peculiarity when once acquired is long inherited, and\r\nstructures already modified in many different ways have to be adapted\r\nfor the same general purpose. We can, in short, see why nature is\r\nprodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation. But why this should\r\nbe a law of nature if each species has been independently created no man\r\ncan explain.\r\n\r\nMany other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory. How\r\nstrange it is that a bird, under the form of a woodpecker, should prey\r\non insects on the ground; that upland geese which rarely or never swim,\r\nwould possess webbed feet; that a thrush-like bird should dive and feed\r\non sub-aquatic insects; and that a petrel should have the habits and\r\nstructure fitting it for the life of an auk! and so in endless other\r\ncases. But on the view of each species constantly trying to increase in\r\nnumber, with natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying\r\ndescendants of each to any unoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature,\r\nthese facts cease to be strange, or might even have been anticipated.\r\n\r\nWe can to a certain extent understand how it is that there is so much\r\nbeauty throughout nature; for this may be largely attributed to the\r\nagency of selection. That beauty, according to our sense of it, is not\r\nuniversal, must be admitted by every one who will look at some venomous\r\nsnakes, at some fishes, and at certain hideous bats with a distorted\r\nresemblance to the human face. Sexual selection has given the most\r\nbrilliant colours, elegant patterns, and other ornaments to the males,\r\nand sometimes to both sexes of many birds, butterflies and other\r\nanimals. With birds it has often rendered the voice of the male musical\r\nto the female, as well as to our ears. Flowers and fruit have been\r\nrendered conspicuous by brilliant colours in contrast with the green\r\nfoliage, in order that the flowers may be easily seen, visited and\r\nfertilized by insects, and the seeds disseminated by birds. How it comes\r\nthat certain colours, sounds and forms should give pleasure to man and\r\nthe lower animals, that is, how the sense of beauty in its simplest form\r\nwas first acquired, we do not know any more than how certain odours and\r\nflavours were first rendered agreeable.\r\n\r\nAs natural selection acts by competition, it adopts and improves the\r\ninhabitants of each country only in relation to their co-inhabitants; so\r\nthat we need feel no surprise at the species of any one country,\r\nalthough on the ordinary view supposed to have been created and\r\nspecially adapted for that country, being beaten and supplanted by the\r\nnaturalized productions from another land. Nor ought we marvel if all\r\nthe contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can judge, absolutely\r\nperfect, as in the case even of the human eye; or if some of them be\r\nabhorrent to our ideas of fitness. We need not marvel at the sting of\r\nthe bee, when used against an enemy, causing the bee's own death; at\r\ndrones being produced in such great numbers for one single act, and\r\nbeing then slaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the astonishing\r\nwaste of pollen by our fir trees; at the instinctive hatred of the queen\r\nbee for her own fertile daughters; at ichneumonidæ feeding within the\r\nliving bodies of caterpillars; or at other such cases. The wonder\r\nindeed, is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases of the\r\nwant of absolute perfection have not been detected.\r\n\r\nThe complex and little known laws governing production of varieties are\r\nthe same, as far as we can judge, with the laws which have governed the\r\nproduction of distinct species. In both cases physical conditions seem\r\nto have produced some direct and definite effect, but how much we cannot\r\nsay. Thus, when varieties enter any new station, they occasionally\r\nassume some of the characters proper to the species of that station.\r\nWith both varieties and species, use and disuse seem to have produced a\r\nconsiderable effect; for it is impossible to resist this conclusion when\r\nwe look, for instance, at the logger-headed duck, which has wings\r\nincapable of flight, in nearly the same condition as in the domestic\r\nduck; or when we look at the burrowing tucu-tucu, which is occasionally\r\nblind, and then at certain moles, which are habitually blind and have\r\ntheir eyes covered with skin; or when we look at the blind animals\r\ninhabiting the dark caves of America and Europe. With varieties and\r\nspecies, correlated variation seems to have played an important part, so\r\nthat when one part has been modified other parts have been necessarily\r\nmodified. With both varieties and species, reversions to long-lost\r\ncharacters occasionally occur. How inexplicable on the theory of\r\ncreation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulders and\r\nlegs of the several species of the horse-genus and of their hybrids! How\r\nsimply is this fact explained if we believe that these species are all\r\ndescended from a striped progenitor, in the same manner as the several\r\ndomestic breeds of the pigeon are descended from the blue and barred\r\nrock pigeon!\r\n\r\nOn the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,\r\nwhy should specific characters, or those by which the species of the\r\nsame genus differ from each other, be more variable than generic\r\ncharacters in which they all agree? Why, for instance, should the colour\r\nof a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of genus, if the\r\nother species possess differently coloured flowers, than if all\r\npossessed the same coloured flowers? If species are only well-marked\r\nvarieties, of which the characters have become in a high degree\r\npermanent, we can understand this fact; for they have already varied\r\nsince they branched off from a common progenitor in certain characters,\r\nby which they have come to be specifically different from each other;\r\ntherefore these same characters would be more likely again to vary than\r\nthe generic characters which have been inherited without change for an\r\nimmense period. It is inexplicable on the theory of creation why a part\r\ndeveloped in a very unusual manner in one species alone of a genus, and\r\ntherefore, as we may naturally infer, of great importance to that\r\nspecies, should be eminently liable to variation; but, on our view,\r\nthis part has undergone, since the several species branched off from a\r\ncommon progenitor, an unusual amount of variability and modification,\r\nand therefore we might expect the part generally to be still variable.\r\nBut a part may be developed in the most unusual manner, like the wing of\r\na bat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if the\r\npart be common to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been\r\ninherited for a very long period; for in this case it will have been\r\nrendered constant by long-continued natural selection.\r\n\r\nGlancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they offer no greater\r\ndifficulty than do corporeal structures on the theory of the natural\r\nselection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. We can\r\nthus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing certain\r\nanimals of the same class with their several instincts. I have attempted\r\nto show how much light the principle of gradation throws on the\r\nadmirable architectural powers of the hive-bee. Habit no doubt often\r\ncomes into play in modifying instincts; but it certainly is not\r\nindispensable, as we see in the case of neuter insects, which leave no\r\nprogeny to inherit the effects of long-continued habit. On the view of\r\nall the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent,\r\nand having inherited much in common, we can understand how it is that\r\nallied species, when placed under widely different conditions of life,\r\nyet follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrushes of temperate and\r\ntropical South America, for instance, line their nests with mud like our\r\nBritish species. On the view of instincts having been slowly acquired\r\nthrough natural selection, we need not marvel at some instincts being\r\nnot perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many instincts causing other\r\nanimals to suffer.\r\n\r\nIf species be only well-marked and permanent varieties, we can see at\r\nonce why their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws in\r\ntheir degrees and kinds of resemblance to their parents--in being\r\nabsorbed into each other by successive crosses, and in other such\r\npoints--as do the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties. This\r\nsimilarity would be a strange fact, if species had been independently\r\ncreated and varieties had been produced through secondary laws.\r\n\r\nIf we admit that the geological record is imperfect to an extreme\r\ndegree, then the facts, which the record does give, strongly support the\r\ntheory of descent with modification. New species have come on the stage\r\nslowly and at successive intervals; and the amount of change after equal\r\nintervals of time, is widely different in different groups. The\r\nextinction of species and of whole groups of species, which has played\r\nso conspicuous a part in the history of the organic world, almost\r\ninevitably follows from the principle of natural selection; for old\r\nforms are supplanted by new and improved forms. Neither single species\r\nnor groups of species reappear when the chain of ordinary generation is\r\nonce broken. The gradual diffusion of dominant forms, with the slow\r\nmodification of their descendants, causes the forms of life, after long\r\nintervals of time, to appear as if they had changed simultaneously\r\nthroughout the world. The fact of the fossil remains of each formation\r\nbeing in some degree intermediate in character between the fossils in\r\nthe formations above and below, is simply explained by their\r\nintermediate position in the chain of descent. The grand fact that all\r\nextinct beings can be classed with all recent beings, naturally follows\r\nfrom the living and the extinct being the offspring of common parents.\r\nAs species have generally diverged in character during their long course\r\nof descent and modification, we can understand why it is that the more\r\nancient forms, or early progenitors of each group, so often occupy a\r\nposition in some degree intermediate between existing groups. Recent\r\nforms are generally looked upon as being, on the whole, higher in the\r\nscale of organization than ancient forms; and they must be higher, in so\r\nfar as the later and more improved forms have conquered the older and\r\nless improved forms in the struggle for life; they have also generally\r\nhad their organs more specialized for different functions. This fact is\r\nperfectly compatible with numerous beings still retaining simple but\r\nlittle improved structures, fitted for simple conditions of life; it is\r\nlikewise compatible with some forms having retrograded in organization,\r\nby having become at each stage of descent better fitted for new and\r\ndegraded habits of life. Lastly, the wonderful law of the long endurance\r\nof allied forms on the same continent--of marsupials [as kangaroos] in\r\nAustralia, of edentata [as armadillos, sloths, and anteaters] in\r\nAmerica, and other such cases--is intelligible, for within the same\r\ncountry the existing and the extinct will be closely allied by descent.\r\n\r\nLooking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been\r\nduring the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world\r\nto another, owing to former climatical and geographical changes and to\r\nthe many occasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can\r\nunderstand, on the theory of descent with modification, most of the\r\ngreat leading facts in distribution. We can see why there should be so\r\nstriking a parallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout\r\nspace, and in their geological succession throughout time; for in both\r\ncases the beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation,\r\nand the means of modification have been the same. We see the full\r\nmeaning of the wonderful fact, which has struck every traveller, namely,\r\nthat on the same continent, under the most diverse conditions, under\r\nheat and cold, on mountain and lowland, on deserts and marshes, most of\r\nthe inhabitants within each great class are plainly related; for they\r\nare the descendants of the same progenitors and early colonists. On this\r\nsame principle of former migration, combined in most cases with\r\nmodification, we can understand by the aid of the Glacial period, the\r\nidentity of some few plants and the close alliance of many others, on\r\nthe most distant mountains, and in the northern and southern temperate\r\nzones; and likewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the\r\nsea in the northern and southern temperate latitudes, though separated\r\nby the whole inter-tropical ocean. Although two countries may present\r\nphysical conditions as closely similar as the same species ever acquire,\r\nwe need feel no surprise at their inhabitants being widely different, if\r\nthey have been for a long period completely sundered from each other;\r\nfor as the relation of organism to organism is the most important of all\r\nrelations, and as the two countries will have received colonists at\r\nvarious periods and in different proportions, from some other country or\r\nfrom each other, the course of modification in the two areas will\r\ninevitably have been different.\r\n\r\nOn this view of migration, with subsequent modification, we see why\r\noceanic islands are inhabited by only few species, but of these, why\r\nmany are peculiar or endemic forms. We clearly see why species belonging\r\nto those groups of animals which cannot cross wide spaces of the ocean,\r\nas frogs and terrestrial mammals, do not inhabit oceanic islands; and\r\nwhy, on the other hand, new and peculiar species of bats, animals which\r\ncan traverse the ocean, are often found on islands far distant from any\r\ncontinent. Such cases as the presence of peculiar species of bats on\r\noceanic islands and the absence of all other terrestrial mammals, are\r\nfacts utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nThe existence of closely allied representative species in any two areas,\r\nimplies on the theory of descent with modification, that the same\r\nparent-forms formerly inhabited both areas: and we almost invariably\r\nfind that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two areas, some\r\nidentical species are still common to both. Wherever many closely allied\r\nyet distant species occur, doubtful forms and varieties belonging to the\r\nsame groups likewise occur. It is a rule of high generality that the\r\ninhabitants of each area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest\r\nsource whence immigrants might have been derived. We see this in the\r\nstriking relation of nearly all the plants and animals of the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago, of Juan Fernandez, and of the other American islands, to\r\nthe plants and animals of the neighbouring American mainland; and of\r\nthose of the Cape Verde Archipelago, and of the other African islands to\r\nthe African mainland. It must be admitted that these facts receive no\r\nexplanation on the theory of creation.\r\n\r\nThe fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings can\r\nbe arranged within a few great classes, in groups subordinate to groups,\r\nand with the extinct groups often falling in between the recent groups,\r\nis intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its\r\ncontingencies of extinction and divergence of character. On these same\r\nprinciples we see how it is that the mutual affinities of the forms\r\nwithin each class are so complex and circuitous. We see why certain\r\ncharacters are far more serviceable than others for classification; why\r\nadaptive characters derived from rudimentary parts, though of no service\r\nto the beings, are often of high classificatory value; and why\r\nembryological characters are often the most valuable of all. The real\r\naffinities of all organic beings, in contradistinction to their adaptive\r\nresemblances, are due to inheritance or community of descent. The\r\nNatural System is a genealogical arrangement, with the acquired grades\r\nof difference, marked by the terms, varieties, species, genera,\r\nfamilies, etc.; and we have to discover the lines of descent by the most\r\npermanent characters, whatever they may be, and of however slight vital\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe similar framework of bones in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin\r\nof the porpoise, and leg of the horse--the same number of vertebræ\r\nforming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant--and innumerable\r\nother such facts, at once explain themselves on the theory of descent\r\nwith slow and slight successive modifications. The similarity of pattern\r\nin the wing and in the leg of a bat, though used for such different\r\npurpose--in the jaws and legs of a crab--in the petals, stamens, and\r\npistils of a flower, is likewise, to a large extent, intelligible on\r\nthe view of the gradual modification of parts or organs, which were\r\naboriginally alike in an early progenitor in each of these classes. On\r\nthe principle of successive variations not always supervening at an\r\nearly age, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period of\r\nlife, we clearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds, reptiles, and\r\nfishes should be so closely similar, and so unlike the adult forms. We\r\nmay cease marvelling at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird\r\nhaving branchial slits and arteries running in loops, like those of a\r\nfish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water by the aid of\r\nwell-developed branchiæ [gills].\r\n\r\nDisuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often have reduced\r\norgans when rendered useless under changed habits or conditions of life;\r\nand we can understand on this view the meaning of rudimentary organs.\r\nBut disuse and selection will generally act on each creature, when it\r\nhas come to maturity and has to play its full part in the struggle for\r\nexistence, and will thus have little power in an organ during early\r\nlife; hence the organ will not be reduced or rendered rudimentary at\r\nthis early age. The calf, for instance, has inherited teeth, which never\r\ncut through the gums of the upper jaw, from an early progenitor having\r\nwell-developed teeth; and we may believe, that the teeth in the mature\r\nanimal were formerly reduced by disuse, owing to the tongue and palate,\r\nor lips, having become excellently fitted through natural selection to\r\nbrowse without their aid; whereas in the calf, the teeth have been left\r\nunaffected, and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages\r\nhave been inherited from a remote period to the present day. On the view\r\nof each organism with all its separate parts having been specially\r\ncreated, how utterly inexplicable is it that organs bearing the plain\r\nstamp of inutility, such as the teeth in the embryonic calf or the\r\nshrivelled wings under the soldered wing covers of many beetles, should\r\nso frequently occur. Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal\r\nher scheme of modification, by means of rudimentary organs, of\r\nembryological and homologous [corresponding] structures, but we are too\r\nblind to understand her meaning.\r\n\r\nI have now recapitulated the facts and considerations which have\r\nthoroughly convinced me that species have been modified, during a long\r\ncourse of descent. This has been effected chiefly through the natural\r\nselection of numerous successive, slight, favourable variations; aided\r\nin an important manner by the inherited effects of the use and disuse of\r\nparts; and in an unimportant manner, that is, in relation to adaptive\r\nstructures, whether past or present, by the direct action of external\r\nconditions, and by variations which seem to us in our ignorance to arise\r\nspontaneously. It appears that I formerly underrated the frequency and\r\nvalue of these latter forms of variation, as leading to permanent\r\nmodifications of structure independently of natural selection. But as\r\nmy conclusions have lately been much misrepresented, and it has been\r\nstated that I attribute the modification of species exclusively to\r\nnatural selection, I may be permitted to remark that in the first\r\nedition of this work, and subsequently, I placed in a most conspicuous,\r\nposition--namely, at the close of the Introduction--the following words:\r\n\"I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not the\r\nexclusive means of modification.\" This has been of no avail. Great is\r\nthe power of steady misrepresentation; but the history of science shows\r\nthat fortunately this power does not long endure.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be supposed that a false theory would explain, in so\r\nsatisfactory a manner as does the theory of natural selection, the\r\nseveral large classes of facts above specified. It has recently been\r\nobjected that this is an unsafe method of arguing; but it is a method\r\nused in judging the common events of life, and has often been used by\r\nthe greatest natural philosophers. The undulatory theory of light has\r\nthus been arrived at; and the belief in the revolution of the earth on\r\nits own axis was until lately supported by hardly any direct evidence.\r\nIt is no valid objection that science as yet throws no light on the far\r\nhigher problems of the essence of the origin of life. Who can explain\r\nwhat is the essence of the attraction of gravity? No one now objects to\r\nfollowing out the results consequent on this unknown element of\r\nattraction; notwithstanding that Leibnitz formerly accused Newton of\r\nintroducing \"occult qualities and miracles into philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nI see no good reasons why the views given in this volume should shock\r\nthe religious feelings of any one. It is satisfactory, as showing how\r\ntransient such impressions are, to remember that the greatest discovery\r\never made by man, namely, the law of the attraction of gravity, was also\r\nattacked by Leibnitz, \"as subversive of natural, and inferentially of\r\nrevealed religion.\" A celebrated author and divine has written to me\r\nthat \"he has gradually learned to see that it is just as noble a\r\nconception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms\r\ncapable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe\r\nthat He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by\r\nthe action of His laws.\"\r\n\r\nWhy, it may be asked, until recently did nearly all the most eminent\r\nliving naturalists and geologists disbelieve in the mutability of\r\nspecies? It cannot be asserted that organic beings in a state of nature\r\nare subject to no variation; it cannot be proved that the amount of\r\nvariation in the course of long ages is a limited quantity; no clear\r\ndistinction has been, or can be, drawn between species and well-marked\r\nvarieties. It cannot be maintained that species when intercrossed are\r\ninvariably sterile and varieties invariably fertile; or that sterility\r\nis a special endowment and sign of creation. The belief that species\r\nwere immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the\r\nhistory of the world was thought to be of short duration; and now that\r\nwe have acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are too apt to\r\nassume, without proof, that the geological record is so perfect that it\r\nwould have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species, if\r\nthey had undergone mutation.\r\n\r\nBut the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one\r\nspecies has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are\r\nalways slow in admitting great changes of which we do not see the steps.\r\nThe difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when\r\nLyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been formed,\r\nand great valleys excavated, by the agencies which we still see at work.\r\nThe mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of even a\r\nmillion years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many\r\nslight variations, accumulated during an almost infinite number of\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this\r\nvolume under the form of an abstract, I by no means expect to convince\r\nexperienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of\r\nfacts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view\r\ndirectly opposite to mine. It is so easy to hide our ignorance under\r\nsuch expressions as the \"plan of creation,\" \"unity of design,\" etc., and\r\nto think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact. Any\r\none whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained\r\ndifficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will\r\ncertainly reject the theory. A few naturalists, endowed with much\r\nflexibility of mind, and who have already begun to doubt the\r\nimmutability of species, may be influenced by this volume; but I look\r\nwith confidence to the future, to young and rising naturalists, who will\r\nbe able to view both sides of the question with impartiality. Whoever is\r\nled to believe that species are mutable will do good service by\r\nconscientiously expressing his conviction; for thus only can the load of\r\nprejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed.\r\n\r\nSeveral eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that a\r\nmultitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species; but\r\nthat other species are real, that is, have been independently created.\r\nThis seems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at. They admit that a\r\nmultitude of forms, which till lately they themselves thought were\r\nspecial creations, and which are still thus looked at by the majority of\r\nnaturalists, and which consequently have all the external characteristic\r\nfeatures of true species--they admit that these have been produced by\r\nvariation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other and slightly\r\ndifferent forms. Nevertheless, they do not pretend that they can define,\r\nor even conjecture, which are the created forms of life, and which are\r\nthose produced by secondary laws. They admit variation as a true cause\r\nin one case, they arbitrarily reject it in another, without assigning\r\nany distinction in the two cases. The day will come when this will be\r\ngiven as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived\r\nopinion. These authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of\r\ncreation than at an ordinary birth. But do they really believe that at\r\ninnumerable periods in the earth's history certain elemental atoms have\r\nbeen commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? Do they believe\r\nthat at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were\r\nproduced? Were all the infinite numerous kinds of animals and plants\r\ncreated as eggs or seed, or as full grown? and in the case of mammals,\r\nwere they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the\r\nmother's womb? Undoubtedly some of these same questions cannot be\r\nanswered by those who believe in the appearance or creation of only a\r\nfew forms of life, or of some one form alone. It has been maintained by\r\nseveral authors that it is as easy to believe in the creation of a\r\nmillion beings as of one; but Maupertuis's philosophical axiom \"of least\r\naction\" leads the mind more willingly to admit the smaller number; and\r\ncertainly we ought not to believe that innumerable beings within each\r\ngreat class have been created with plain, but deceptive, marks of\r\ndescent from a single parent.\r\n\r\nAs a record of a former state of things, I have retained in the\r\nforegoing paragraphs, and elsewhere, several sentences which imply that\r\nnaturalists believe in the separate creation of each species; and I have\r\nbeen much censured for having thus expressed myself. But undoubtedly\r\nthis was the general belief when the first edition of the present work\r\nappeared. I formerly spoke to very many naturalists on the subject of\r\nevolution, and never once met with any sympathetic agreement. It is\r\nprobable that some did then believe in evolution, but they were either\r\nsilent or expressed themselves so ambiguously that it was not easy to\r\nunderstand their meaning. Now, things are wholly changed, and almost\r\nevery naturalist admits the great principle of evolution. There are,\r\nhowever, some who still think that species have suddenly given birth,\r\nthrough quite unexplained means, to new and totally different forms.\r\nBut, as I have attempted to show, weighty evidence can be opposed to the\r\nadmission of great and abrupt modifications. Under a scientific point of\r\nview, and as leading to further investigation, but little advantage is\r\ngained by believing that new forms are suddenly developed in an\r\ninexplicable manner from old and widely different forms, over the old\r\nbelief in the creation of species from the dust of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked how far I extend the doctrine of the modification of\r\nspecies. The question is difficult to answer, because the more distinct\r\nthe forms are which we consider, by so much the arguments in favour of\r\ncommunity of descent become fewer in number and less in force. But some\r\narguments of the greatest weight extend very far. All the members of\r\nwhole classes are connected together by a chain of affinities, and all\r\ncan be classed on the same principle, in groups subordinate to groups.\r\nFossil remains sometimes tend to fill up very wide intervals between\r\nexisting orders.\r\n\r\nOrgans in a rudimentary condition plainly show that an early progenitor\r\nhad the organ in a fully developed condition, and this in some cases\r\nimplies an enormous amount of modification in the descendants.\r\nThroughout whole classes various structures are formed on the same\r\npattern, and at a very early age the embryos closely resemble each\r\nother. Therefore I cannot doubt that the theory of descent with\r\nmodification embraces all the members of the same great class or\r\nkingdom. I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or\r\nfive progenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number.\r\n\r\nAnalogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all\r\nanimals and plants are descended from some one prototype. But analogy\r\nmay be a deceitful guide. Nevertheless all living things have much in\r\ncommon, in their chemical composition, their cellular structure, their\r\nlaws of growth, and their liability to injurious influences. We see this\r\neven in so trifling a fact as that the same poison often similarly\r\naffects plants and animals; or that the poison secreted by the gall-fly\r\nproduces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak tree. With all\r\norganic beings, excepting perhaps some of the very lowest, sexual\r\nreproduction seems to be essentially similar. With all, as far as is at\r\npresent known, the germinal vesicle is the same; so that all organisms\r\nstart from a common origin. If we look even to the two main\r\ndivisions--namely, to the animal and vegetable kingdoms--certain low\r\nforms are so far intermediate in character that naturalists have\r\ndisputed to which kingdom they should be referred. As Professor Asa Gray\r\nhas remarked, \"the spores and other reproductive bodies of many of the\r\nlower algæ may claim to have first a characteristically animal, and then\r\nan unequivocally vegetable existence.\" Therefore, on the principle of\r\nnatural selection with divergence of character, it does not seem\r\nincredible that, from some such low and intermediate form, both animals\r\nand plants may have been developed; and, if we admit this, we must\r\nlikewise admit that all the organic beings which have ever lived on this\r\nearth may be descended from some one primordial form. But this inference\r\nis chiefly grounded on analogy, and it is immaterial whether or not it\r\nis accepted. No doubt it is possible, as Mr. G. H. Lewes has urged, that\r\nat the first commencement of life many different forms were evolved; but\r\nif so, we may conclude that only a very few have left modified\r\ndescendants. For, as I have recently remarked in regard to the members\r\nof each great kingdom, such as the Vertebrata, Articulata, etc., we\r\nhave distinct evidence in their embryological, homologous, and\r\nrudimentary structures, that within each kingdom all the members are\r\ndescended from a single progenitor.\r\n\r\nWhen the views advanced by me in this volume, and by Mr. Wallace, or\r\nwhen analogous views on the origin of species are generally admitted, we\r\ncan dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in\r\nnatural history. Systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at\r\npresent; but they will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt\r\nwhether this or that form be a true species. This, I feel sure and I\r\nspeak after experience, will be no slight relief. The endless disputes\r\nwhether or not some fifty species of British brambles are good species\r\nwill cease. Systematists will have only to decide (not that this will be\r\neasy) whether any form be sufficiently constant and distinct from other\r\nforms, to be capable of definition; and if definable, whether the\r\ndifferences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific name. This\r\nlatter point will become a far more essential consideration than it is\r\nat present; for differences, however slight, between any two forms, if\r\nnot blended by intermediate gradations, are looked at by most\r\nnaturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species.\r\n\r\nHereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction\r\nbetween species and well-marked varieties is, that the latter are known,\r\nor believed to be connected at the present day by intermediate\r\ngradations, whereas species were formerly thus connected. Hence, without\r\nrejecting the considerations of the present existence of intermediate\r\ngradations between any two forms, we shall be led to weigh more\r\ncarefully and to value higher the actual amount of difference between\r\nthem. It is quite possible that forms now generally acknowledged to be\r\nmerely varieties may hereafter be thought worthy of specific names; and\r\nin this case scientific and common language will come into accordance.\r\nIn short, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those\r\nnaturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial\r\ncombinations made for convenience. This may not be a cheering prospect;\r\nbut we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered\r\nand undiscoverable essence of the term species.\r\n\r\nThe other and more general departments of natural history will rise\r\ngreatly in interest. The terms used by naturalists, of affinity,\r\nrelationship, community of type, paternity, morphology [the science of\r\norganic form], adaptive characters, rudimentary and aborted organs,\r\netc., will cease to be metaphorical and will have a plain signification.\r\nWhen we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship,\r\nas something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every\r\nproduction of nature as one which has had a long history; when we\r\ncontemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of\r\nmany contrivances, each useful to the possessor, in the same way as any\r\ngreat mechanical invention is the summing up of the labour, the\r\nexperience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when\r\nwe thus view each organic being, how far more interesting--I speak from\r\nexperience--does the study of natural history become!\r\n\r\nA grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened, on the\r\ncauses and laws of variation, on correlation, on the effects of use and\r\ndisuse, on the direct action of external conditions, and so forth. The\r\nstudy of domestic productions will rise immensely in value. A new\r\nvariety raised by man will be a more important and interesting subject\r\nfor study than one more species added to the infinitude of already\r\nrecorded species. Our classifications will come to be, as far as they\r\ncan be so made, genealogies; and will then truly give what may be called\r\nthe plan of creation. The rules for classifying will no doubt become\r\nsimpler when we have a definite object in view. We possess no pedigree\r\nor armorial bearings; and we have to discover and trace the many\r\ndiverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by characters of\r\nany kind which have long been inherited. Rudimentary[1] organs will\r\nspeak infallibly with respect to the nature of long-lost structures.\r\nSpecies and groups of species which are called aberrant, and which may\r\nfancifully be called living fossils, will aid us in forming a picture of\r\nthe ancient forms of life. Embryology will often reveal to us the\r\nstructure, in some degree obscured, of the prototypes of each great\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nWhen we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species,\r\nand all the closely allied species of most genera, have, within a not\r\nvery remote period descended from one parent, and have migrated from\r\nsome one birth-place; and when we better know the many means of\r\nmigration, then, by the light which geology now throws, and will\r\ncontinue to throw, on former changes of climate and of the level of the\r\nland, we shall surely be enabled to trace in an admirable manner the\r\nformer migrations of the inhabitants of the whole world. Even at\r\npresent, by comparing the differences between the inhabitants of the sea\r\non the opposite sides of a continent, and the nature of the various\r\ninhabitants on that continent in relation to their apparent means of\r\nimmigration, some light can be thrown on ancient geography.\r\n\r\nThe noble science of geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection\r\nof the record. The crust of the earth, with its imbedded remains, must\r\nnot be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made\r\nat hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great\r\nfossiliferous formation will be recognized as having depended on an\r\nunusual occurrence of favourable circumstances, and the blank intervals\r\nbetween the successive stages as having been of vast duration. But we\r\nshall be able to gauge with some security the duration of these\r\nintervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeding organic forms.\r\nWe must be cautious in attempting to correlate as strictly\r\ncontemporaneous two formations, which do not include many identical\r\nspecies, by the general succession of the forms of life.\r\n\r\nAs species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still\r\nexisting causes, and not by miraculous acts of creation; and as the most\r\nimportant of all causes of organic change is one which is almost\r\nindependent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions,\r\nnamely, the mutual relation of organism to organism--the improvement of\r\none organism entailing the improvement or the extermination of others;\r\nit follows, that the amount of organic change in the fossils of\r\nconsecutive formations probably serves as a fair measure of the\r\nrelative, though not actual lapse of time. A number of species, however,\r\nkeeping in a body might remain for a long period unchanged, while within\r\nthe same period, several of these species, by migrating into new\r\ncountries and coming into competition with foreign associates, might\r\nbecome modified; so that we must not overrate the accuracy of organic\r\nchange as a measure of time.\r\n\r\nIn the future I see open fields for far more important researches.\r\nPsychology will be securely based on the foundation already well laid by\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental\r\npower and capacity by gradation. Much light will be thrown on the\r\norigin of man and his history.\r\n\r\nAuthors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view\r\nthat each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords\r\nbetter with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator,\r\nthat the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants\r\nof the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those\r\ndetermining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all\r\nbeings as not special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some\r\nfew beings which lived long before the first bed of the Cambrian system\r\nwas deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the\r\npast, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its\r\nunaltered likeness to a distant futurity. And of the species now living\r\nvery few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity;\r\nfor the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the\r\ngreater number of species in each genus, and all the species in many\r\ngenera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We\r\ncan so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretell that it\r\nwill be the common and widely spread species, belonging to the larger\r\nand dominant groups within each class, which will ultimately prevail and\r\nprocreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are\r\nthe lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Cambrian\r\nepoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation\r\nhas never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the\r\nwhole world. Hence, we may look with some confidence to a secure future\r\nof great length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the\r\ngood of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to\r\nprogress toward perfection.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many\r\nplants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various\r\ninsects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth,\r\nand to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different\r\nfrom each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner,\r\nhave all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws taken in the\r\nlargest sense, being growth with reproduction; Inheritance which is\r\nalmost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct\r\naction of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse: a Ratio of\r\nIncrease so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence\r\nto Natural Selection, entailing divergence of Character and the\r\nExtinction of less improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from\r\nfamine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of\r\nconceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly\r\nfollows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several\r\npowers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms\r\nor into one; and that, while this planet has gone circling on according\r\nto the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms\r\nmost beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Vestigial_ is now preferred to _rudimentary_ as a term.--Ed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW \"THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES\" CAME TO BE WRITTEN.\r\n\r\n     [An extract from the autobiography of Charles Darwin, in \"The\r\n     Life and Letters of Charles Darwin,\" New York, D. Appleton &\r\n     Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom September, 1854, I devoted my whole time to arranging my huge pile\r\nof notes, to observing and to experimenting in relation to the\r\ntransmutation of species. During the voyage of the _Beagle_ I had been\r\ndeeply impressed by discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil\r\nanimals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos;\r\nsecondly, by the manner in which closely allied animals replace one\r\nanother in proceeding southwards over the continent; and, thirdly, by\r\nthe South American character of most of the productions of the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago, and more especially by the manner in which these differ\r\nslightly on each island of the group, none of these islands appearing to\r\nbe very ancient in a geological sense.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that such facts as these, as well as many others, could\r\nonly be explained on the supposition that species gradually become\r\nmodified; and the subject haunted me. But it was equally evident that\r\nneither the action of the surrounding conditions, nor the will of the\r\norganisms (especially in the case of plants) could account for the\r\ninnumerable cases in which organisms of every kind are beautifully\r\nadapted to their habits of life--for instance, a woodpecker or a\r\ntree-frog to climb trees, or a seed for dispersal by hooks or plumes. I\r\nhad always been much struck by such adaptations, and until these could\r\nbe explained it seemed to me almost useless to endeavour to prove by\r\nindirect evidence that species have been modified.\r\n\r\nAfter my return to England it appeared to me that by following the\r\nexample of Lyell in geology,[2] and by collecting all facts that bore in\r\nany way on the variation of animals and plants under domestication and\r\nnature, some light might perhaps be thrown on the whole subject. My\r\nfirst note-book was opened in July, 1837. I worked on true Baconian\r\nprinciples, and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale,\r\nmore especially with respect to domesticated productions, by printed\r\nenquiries, by conversation with skilful breeders and gardeners and by\r\nextensive reading. When I see the list of books of all kinds which I\r\nread and abstracted, including whole series of journals and\r\ntranslations, I am surprised at my industry. I soon perceived that\r\nselection was the keystone of man's success in making useful races of\r\nanimals and plants. But how selection could be applied to organisms\r\nliving in a state of nature remained for some time a mystery to me.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1838, that is fifteen months after I had begun my systematic\r\nenquiry, I happened to read for amusement \"Malthus on Population,\" and\r\nbeing well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which\r\neverywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of\r\nanimals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances\r\nfavourable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavourable ones\r\nto be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of a new\r\nspecies. Here then I had at last got a theory by which to work; but I\r\nwas so anxious to avoid prejudice that I determined not for some time to\r\nwrite even the briefest sketch of it. In June, 1842, I first allowed\r\nmyself the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my theory in\r\npencil in 35 pages; and this was enlarged during the summer of 1844 into\r\none of 230 pages, which I had fairly copied out and still possess.\r\n\r\nBut at that time I overlooked one problem of great importance; and it is\r\nastonishing to me, except on the principle of Columbus and his egg, how\r\nI could have overlooked it and its solution. This problem is the\r\ntendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in\r\ncharacter as they become, modified. That they have diverged greatly is\r\nobvious from the manner in which species of all kinds can be classed\r\nunder genera, genera under families, families under sub-orders and so\r\nforth; and I can remember the very spot on the road, whilst in my\r\ncarriage, when to my joy the solution occurred to me; and this was long\r\nafter I had come to Down. This solution, as I believe, is that the\r\nmodified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become\r\nadapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1856 Lyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully, and I\r\nbegan at once to do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as\r\nthat which was afterwards followed in my \"Origin of Species;\" yet it was\r\nonly an abstract of the materials which I had collected and I got\r\nthrough about half the work on this scale. But my plans were overthrown,\r\nfor early in the summer of 1858 Mr. Wallace, who was then in the Malay\r\nArchipelago, sent me an essay \"On the tendency of varieties to depart\r\nindefinitely from the original type;\" and this essay contained exactly\r\nthe same theory as mine.[3] Mr. Wallace expressed the wish that if I\r\nthought well of his essay I should send it to Lyell for perusal.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which I consented at the request of Lyell and\r\nHooker to allow of an abstract from my MS., together with a letter to\r\nAsa Gray, dated September 5, 1857, to be published at the same time\r\nwith Wallace's essay, are given in the \"Journal of the Proceedings of\r\nthe Linnean Society,\" 1858, p. 45. I was at first very unwilling to\r\nconsent, as I thought Mr. Wallace might consider my doing so\r\nunjustifiable, for I did not then know how generous and noble was his\r\ndisposition. The extract from my MS. and the letter to Asa Gray had\r\nneither been intended for publication, and were badly written. Mr.\r\nWallace's essay, on the other hand, was admirably expressed and quite\r\nclear. Nevertheless, our joint productions excited very little\r\nattention, and the only published notice of them which I can remember\r\nwas by Professor Haughton of Dublin, whose verdict was that all that was\r\nnew in them was false, and what was true was old. This shows how\r\nnecessary it is that any new idea should be explained at considerable\r\nlength in order to arouse public attention.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1858, I set to work by the strong advice of Lyell and\r\nHooker to prepare a volume on the transmutation of species, but was\r\noften interrupted by ill health and short visits to Dr. Lane's\r\ndelightful hydropathic establishment at Moor Park. I abstracted the MS.\r\nbegun on a much larger scale in 1856, and completed the volume on the\r\nsame reduced scale. It cost me thirteen months and ten days' hard labor.\r\nIt was published under the title of the \"Origin of Species,\" in\r\nNovember, 1859. Though considerably added to and corrected in the later\r\neditions, it has remained substantially the same book.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt the chief work of my life. It was from the first highly\r\nsuccessful. The first small edition of 1,250 copies was sold on the day\r\nof publication, and a second edition of 3,000 copies soon afterwards.\r\nSixteen thousand copies have now (1876) been sold in England; and\r\nconsidering how stiff a book it is, this is a large sale. It has been\r\ntranslated into almost every European tongue, even into such languages\r\nas Spanish, Bohemian, Polish and Russian. Even an essay in Hebrew has\r\nappeared on it, showing that the theory is contained in the Old\r\nTestament! The reviews were very numerous; for some time all that\r\nappeared on the \"Origin\" and on my related books, and these amount\r\n(excluding newspaper reviews) to 265; but after a time I gave up the\r\nattempt in despair. Many separate essays and books on the subject have\r\nappeared; and in Germany a catalogue or bibliography on \"Darwinismus\"\r\nhas appeared every year or two.\r\n\r\nThe success of the \"Origin\" may, I think, be attributed in large part to\r\nmy having long before written two condensed sketches and to my having\r\nabstracted a much larger manuscript, which was itself an abstract. By\r\nthis means I was enabled to select the more striking facts and\r\nconclusions. I had also, during many years followed a golden rule,\r\nnamely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought\r\ncame across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a\r\nmemorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience\r\nthat such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory\r\nthan favourable ones. Owing to this habit very few objections were\r\nraised against my views which I had not at least noticed and attempted\r\nto answer.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been said that the success of the \"Origin\" proved \"that\r\nthe subject was in the air,\" or \"that men's minds were prepared for it.\"\r\nI do not think that this is strictly true, for I occasionally sounded\r\nnot a few naturalists, and never happened to come across a single one\r\nwho seemed to doubt about the permanence of species. Even Lyell and\r\nHooker, though they listened with interest to me, never seemed to agree.\r\nI tried once or twice to explain to able men what I meant by Natural\r\nSelection, but signally failed. What I believe was strictly true is that\r\ninnumerable well-observed facts were stored in the minds of naturalists\r\nready to take their proper places as soon as any theory which would\r\nreceive them was sufficiently explained. Another element in the success\r\nof the book was its moderate size; and this I owe to the appearance of\r\nMr. Wallace's essay; had I published on the scale on which I began to\r\nwrite in 1856, the book would have been four or five times as large as\r\nthe \"Origin,\" and very few would have had the patience to read it.\r\n\r\nI gained much by my delay an publishing from about, 1839, when the\r\ntheory was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it, for I\r\ncared very little whether men attributed most originality to me or\r\nWallace; and his essay no doubt aided in the reception of the theory. I\r\nwas forestalled in only one important point, which my vanity has always\r\nmade me regret, namely, the explanation by means of the Glacial period\r\nof the presence of the same species of plants and of some few animals on\r\ndistant mountain summits and in the arctic regions. This view pleased me\r\nso much that I wrote it out _in extenso_, and I believe that it was read\r\nby Hooker some years before E. Forbes published in 1846 his celebrated\r\nmemoir on the subject. In the very few points in which we differed, I\r\nstill think that I was in the right. I have never, of course, alluded in\r\nprint to my having independently worked out this view.\r\n\r\nHardly any point gave me so much satisfaction when I was at work on the\r\n\"Origin,\" as the explanation of the wide difference in many classes\r\nbetween the embryo and the adult animal, and of the close resemblance of\r\nthe embryos within the same class. No notice of this point was taken, as\r\nfar as I remember, in the early reviews of the \"Origin,\" and I recollect\r\nexpressing my surprise on this head in a letter to Asa Gray. Within late\r\nyears several reviewers have given the whole credit to Fritz Muller and\r\nHaeckel, who undoubtedly have worked it out much more fully and in some\r\nrespects more correctly than I did. I had materials for a whole chapter\r\non the subject, and I ought to have made the discussion longer; for it\r\nis clear that I failed to impress my readers; and he who succeeds in\r\ndoing so deserves, in my opinion, all the credit.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to remark that I have almost always been treated honestly\r\nby my reviewers, passing over those without scientific knowledge as not\r\nworthy of notice. My views have been grossly misrepresented, bitterly\r\nopposed and ridiculed, but this has been generally done as, I believe,\r\nin good faith. On the whole, I do not doubt that my works have been over\r\nand over again greatly overpraised. I rejoice that I have avoided\r\ncontroversies, and this I owe to Lyell, who many years ago, in reference\r\nto my geological works, strongly advised me never to get entangled in a\r\ncontroversy, as it rarely did any good and caused a miserable loss of\r\ntime and temper.\r\n\r\nWhenever I have found out that I have blundered, or that my work has\r\nbeen imperfect, and when I have been contemptuously criticised, and even\r\nwhen I have been overpraised, so that I have felt mortified, it has been\r\nmy greatest comfort to say hundreds of times to myself that \"I have\r\nworked as hard and as well as I could, and no man can do more than\r\nthis.\" I remember when in Good Success Bay, in Tierra del Fuego,\r\nthinking (and, I believe, that I wrote home to the effect) that I could\r\nnot employ my life better than in adding a little to Natural Science.\r\nThis I have done to the best of my abilities, and critics may say what\r\nthey like, but they can not destroy this conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] See Masterpieces of Science, Vol. I, \"Earth and Sky,\" Sir Charles\r\nLyell on Uniformity in geological change.\r\n\r\n[3] The essay appears in \"Natural Selection,\" London, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESCENT OF MAN\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN\r\n\r\n     [Concluding chapter of \"The Descent of Man,\" New York, D.\r\n     Appleton & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA brief summary will be sufficient to recall to the reader's mind the\r\nmore salient points in this work. Many of the views which have been\r\nadvanced are highly speculative, and some, no doubt, will prove\r\nerroneous; but I have in every case given the reasons which have led me\r\nto one view rather than to another. It seemed worth while to try how far\r\nthe principle of evolution would throw light on some of the more complex\r\nproblems in the natural history of man. False facts are highly injurious\r\nto the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views,\r\nif supported by some evidence, do little harm, for every one takes a\r\nsalutary pleasure in proving their falseness; and, when this is done,\r\none path toward error is closed and the road to truth is often at the\r\nsame time opened.\r\n\r\nThe main conclusion arrived at in this work, and now held by many\r\nnaturalists who are well competent to form a sound judgment, is that man\r\nis descended from some less highly organized form. The grounds upon\r\nwhich this conclusion rests will never be shaken, for the close\r\nsimilarity between man and the lower animals in embryonic development,\r\nas well as in innumerable points of structure and constitution, both of\r\nhigh and of the most trifling importance--the rudiments which he\r\nretains, and the abnormal reversions to which he is occasionally\r\nliable--are facts which cannot be disputed. They have long been known,\r\nbut, until recently, they told us nothing with respect to the origin of\r\nman. Now, when viewed by the light of our knowledge of the whole organic\r\nworld, their meaning is unmistakable. The great principle of evolution\r\nstands up clear and firm when these groups of facts are considered in\r\nconnection with others, such as the mutual affinities of the members of\r\nthe same group, their geographical distribution in past and present\r\ntimes, and their geological succession. It is incredible that all these\r\nfacts should speak falsely. He who is not content to look, like a\r\nsavage, at the phenomena of Nature as disconnected, cannot any longer\r\nbelieve that man is the work of a separate act of creation. He will be\r\nforced to admit that the close resemblance of the embryo of man to that,\r\nfor instance, of a dog--the construction of his skull, limbs and whole\r\nframe on the same plan with that of other mammals--the occasional\r\nappearance of various structures, for instance, of several distinct\r\nmuscles, which man does not normally possess, but which are common to\r\nthe Quadrumana--and a crowd of analogous facts--all point in the\r\nplainest manner to the conclusion that man is the co-descendant of other\r\nmammals of a common progenitor.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that man incessantly presents individual differences in all\r\nparts of his body and in his mental faculties. These differences or\r\nvariations seem to be induced by the same general causes, and to obey\r\nthe same laws as with the lower animals. In both cases similar laws of\r\ninheritance prevail. Man tends to increase at a greater rate than his\r\nmeans of subsistence; consequently he is occasionally subjected to a\r\nsevere struggle for existence, and natural selection will have effected\r\nwhatever lies within its scope. A succession of strongly marked\r\nvariations of a similar nature is by no means requisite; slight\r\nfluctuating differences in the individual suffice in the work of natural\r\nselection. We may feel assured that the inherited effects of the\r\nlong-continued use or disuse of parts will have done much in the same\r\ndirection with natural selection. Modifications formerly of importance,\r\nthough no longer of any special use, are long-inherited. When one part\r\nis modified other parts change through the principle of correlation, of\r\nwhich we have instances in many curious cases of correlated\r\nmonstrosities. Something may be attributed to the direct and definite\r\naction of the surrounding conditions of life, such as abundant food,\r\nheat or moisture; and, lastly, many characters of slight physiological\r\nimportance, some indeed of considerable importance, have been gained\r\nthrough sexual selection.\r\n\r\nNo doubt man, as well as every other animal, presents structures, which,\r\nas far as we can judge with our little knowledge, are not now of any\r\nservice to him, nor to have been so during any former period of his\r\nexistence, either in relation to his general conditions of life, or of\r\none sex to the other. Such structures cannot be accounted for by any\r\nform of selection, or by the inherited effects of the use and disuse of\r\nparts. We know, however, that many strange and strongly marked\r\npeculiarities of structure occasionally appear in our domesticated\r\nproductions, and if the unknown causes which produce them were to act\r\nmore uniformly, they would probably become common to all the individuals\r\nof the species. We may hope hereafter to understand something about the\r\ncauses of such occasional modifications, especially through the study of\r\nmonstrosities; hence, the labours of experimentalists, such as those of\r\nM. Camille Dareste, are full of promise for the future. In general we\r\ncan only say that the cause of each slight variation and of each\r\nmonstrosity lies much more in the constitution of the organism than in\r\nthe nature of the surrounding conditions; though new and changed\r\nconditions certainly play an important part in exciting organic changes\r\nof many kinds.\r\n\r\nThrough the means just specified, aided perhaps by others as yet\r\nundiscovered, man has been raised to his present state. But since he\r\nattained to the rank of manhood, he has diverged into distinct races,\r\nor, as they may be more fitly called, subspecies. Some of these, such as\r\nthe negro and European, are so distinct that, if specimens had been\r\nbrought to a naturalist without any further information, they would\r\nundoubtedly have been considered by him as good and true species.\r\nNevertheless, all the races agree in so many unimportant details of\r\nstructure and in so many mental peculiarities, that these can be\r\naccounted for only by inheritance from a common progenitor; and a\r\nprogenitor thus characterized would probably deserve to rank as man.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the divergence of each race from the other\r\nraces, and of all from a common stock, can be traced back to any one\r\npair of progenitors. On the contrary, at every stage in the process of\r\nmodification, all the individuals which were in any way best fitted for\r\ntheir conditions of life, though in different degrees, would have\r\nsurvived in greater numbers than the less well-fitted. The process would\r\nhave been like that followed by man, when he does not intentionally\r\nselect particular individuals, but breeds from all the superior\r\nindividuals and neglects all the inferior individuals. He thus slowly\r\nbut surely modifies his stock and unconsciously forms a new strain. So\r\nwith respect to modifications acquired independently of selection, and\r\ndue to variations arising from the nature of the organism and the\r\naction of the surrounding conditions, or from changed habits of life, no\r\nsingle pair will have been modified in a much greater degree than the\r\nother pairs which inhabit the same country, for all will have been\r\ncontinually blended through free intercrossing.\r\n\r\nBy considering the embryological structure of man--the homologies\r\n[parallels] which he presents with the lower animals--the rudiments\r\nwhich he retains--and the reversions to which he is liable, we can\r\npartly recall in imagination the former condition of our early\r\nprogenitors; and can approximately place them in their proper place in\r\nthe zoological series. We thus learn that man is descended from a hairy,\r\ntailed quadruped, probably arboreal in its habits [living on or among\r\ntrees] and an inhabitant of the Old World. This creature, if its whole\r\nstructure had been examined by a naturalist, would have been classed\r\namong the Quadrumana, as surely as the still more ancient progenitor of\r\nthe Old and New World monkeys. The Quadrumana and all the higher mammals\r\nare probably derived from an ancient marsupial animal [usually provided\r\nwith a pouch for the reception and nourishment of the young, as in the\r\ncase of the kangaroo] and this through a long line of diversified forms,\r\nfrom some reptile-like or some amphibian-like creature, and this again\r\nfrom some fish-like animal. In the dim obscurity of the past we can see\r\nthat the early progenitor of all the Vertebrata must have been an\r\naquatic animal, provided with branchiæ [gills], with the two sexes\r\nunited in the same individual, and with the most important organs of the\r\nbody (such as the brain and heart) imperfectly or not at all developed.\r\nThis animal seems to have been more like the larvæ of the existing\r\nmarine Ascidians than any other known form.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty which presents itself when we are driven to the\r\nabove conclusion on the origin of man is the high standard of\r\nintellectual power and of moral disposition which he has attained. But\r\nevery one who admits the principle of evolution must see that the mental\r\npowers of the higher animals, which are the same in kind with those of\r\nman, though so different in degree, are capable of advancement. Thus the\r\ninterval between the mental powers of one of the higher apes and of a\r\nfish, or between those of an ant and scale-insect, is immense; yet their\r\ndevelopment does not offer any special difficulty; for with our\r\ndomesticated animals the mental faculties are certainly variable, and\r\nthe variations are inherited. No one doubts that they are of the utmost\r\nimportance to animals in a state of nature. Therefore, the conditions\r\nare favourable for their development through natural selection.\r\n\r\nThe same conclusion may be extended to man; the intellect must have been\r\nall-important to him, even at a very remote period, as enabling him to\r\ninvent and use language, to make weapons, tools, traps, etc., whereby\r\nwith the aid of his social habits he long ago became the most dominant\r\nof all living creatures.\r\n\r\nA great stride in the development of the intellect will have followed,\r\nas soon as the half-art and half-instinct of language came into use; for\r\nthe continued use of language will have reacted on the brain and\r\nproduced an inherited effect; and this again will have reacted on the\r\nimprovement of language. As Mr. Chauncey Wright has well remarked, the\r\nlargeness of the brain in man relatively to his body, compared with the\r\nlower animals, may be attributed in chief part to the early use of some\r\nsimple form of language--that wonderful engine which affixes signs to\r\nall sorts of objects and qualities, and excites trains of thought which\r\nwould never arise from the mere impression of the senses, or if they did\r\narise could not be followed out. The higher intellectual powers of man,\r\nsuch as those of ratiocination, abstraction, self-consciousness, etc.,\r\nwill have followed from the continued improvement of other mental\r\nfaculties; but without considerable culture of the mind, both in the\r\nrace and in the individual, it is doubtful whether these high powers\r\nwould be exercised and thus fully attained.\r\n\r\nThe development of the moral qualities is a more interesting problem.\r\nThe foundation lies in the social instincts, including under this term\r\nthe family ties. These instincts are highly complex, and in the case of\r\nthe lower animals give special tendencies toward certain definite\r\nactions; but the more important elements are love and the distinct\r\nemotion of sympathy. Animals endowed with the social instincts take\r\npleasure in one another's company, warn one another of danger, defend\r\nand aid one another in many ways. These instincts do not extend to all\r\nthe individuals of the species, but only to those of the same community.\r\nAs they are highly beneficial to the species they have in all\r\nprobability been acquired through natural selection.\r\n\r\nA moral being is one who is capable of reflecting on his past actions\r\nand their motives--of approving of some and disapproving of others; and\r\nthe fact that man is the one being who certainly deserves this\r\ndesignation is the greatest of all distinctions between him and the\r\nlower animals. But in the fourth chapter I have endeavoured to show that\r\nthe moral sense follows, firstly, from the enduring and ever-present\r\nnature of the social instincts; secondly, from man's appreciation of the\r\napprobation and disapprobation of his fellows; and, thirdly, from the\r\nhigh activity of his mental faculties, with past impressions extremely\r\nvivid; and in these latter respects he differs from the lower animals.\r\nOwing to this condition of mind, man cannot avoid looking both backward\r\nand forward and comparing past impressions. Hence, after some temporary\r\ndesire or passion has mastered his social instincts, he reflects and\r\ncompares the now weakened impression of such past impulses with the\r\never-present social instincts; and he then feels that sense of\r\ndissatisfaction which all unsatisfied instincts leave behind them, he\r\ntherefore resolves to act differently for the future--and this is\r\nconscience. Any instinct permanently stronger or more enduring than\r\nanother gives rise to a feeling which we express by saying that it ought\r\nto be obeyed. A pointer dog if able to reflect on his past conduct would\r\nsay to himself, I ought (as indeed we say of him) to have pointed at\r\nthat hare and not have yielded to the passing temptation of hunting it.\r\n\r\nSocial animals are impelled partly by a wish to aid the members of their\r\ncommunity in a general manner, but more commonly to perform certain\r\ndefinite actions. Man is impelled by the same general wish to aid his\r\nfellows; but has few or no special instincts. He differs also from the\r\nlower animals in the power of expressing his desires by words, which\r\nthus become a guide to the aid required and bestowed. The motive to give\r\naid is likewise much modified in man; it no longer consists solely of a\r\nblind instinctive impulse, but is much influenced by the praise or blame\r\nof his fellows. The appreciation and bestowal of praise and blame both\r\nrest on sympathy; and this emotion, as we have seen, is one of the most\r\nimportant elements of the social instincts. Sympathy, though gained as\r\nan instinct, is also much strengthened by exercise or habit. As all men\r\ndesire their own happiness, praise or blame is bestowed on actions or\r\nmotives according as they lead to this end; and as happiness is an\r\nessential part of the general good the greatest-happiness principle\r\nindirectly serves as a nearly safe standard of right and wrong. As the\r\nreasoning powers advance and experience is gained the remoter effects of\r\ncertain lines of conduct on the character of the individual and on the\r\ngeneral good are perceived; and then the self-regarding virtues come\r\nwithin the scope of public opinion and receive praise and their\r\nopposites blame. But with the less civilized nations reason often errs,\r\nand many bad customs and base superstitions come within the same scope\r\nand are then esteemed as high virtues and their breach as heavy crimes.\r\n\r\nThe moral faculties are generally and justly esteemed as of higher value\r\nthan the intellectual powers. But we should bear in mind that the\r\nactivity of the mind in vividly recalling past impressions is one of the\r\nfundamental though secondary bases of conscience. This affords the\r\nstrongest argument for educating and stimulating in all possible ways\r\nthe intellectual faculties of every human being. No doubt, a man with a\r\ntorpid mind, if his social affections and sympathies are well developed,\r\nwill be led to good actions and may have a fairly sensitive conscience.\r\nBut whatever renders the imagination more vivid and strengthens the\r\nhabit of recalling and comparing past impressions will make the\r\nconscience more sensitive, and may even somewhat compensate for weak\r\nsocial affections and sympathies.\r\n\r\nThe moral nature of man has reached its present standard partly through\r\nthe advancement of his reasoning powers and consequently of a just\r\npublic opinion, but especially from his sympathies having been rendered\r\nmore tender and widely diffused through the effects of habit, example,\r\ninstruction and reflection. It is not improbable that after long\r\npractice virtuous tendencies may be inherited. With the more civilized\r\nraces the conviction of the existence of an all-seeing Deity has had a\r\npotent influence on the advance of morality. Ultimately man does not\r\naccept the praise or blame of his fellows as his sole guide, though few\r\nescape this influence, but his habitual convictions, controlled by\r\nreason, afford him the safest rule. His conscience then becomes the\r\nsupreme judge and monitor. Nevertheless, the first foundation or origin\r\nof the moral sense lies in the social instincts, including sympathy; and\r\nthese instincts, no doubt, were primarily gained, as in the case of the\r\nlower animals, through natural selection.\r\n\r\nThe belief in God has often been advanced as not only the greatest but\r\nthe most complete of all the distinctions between man and the lower\r\nanimals. It is, however, impossible, as we have seen, to maintain that\r\nthis belief is innate or instinctive in man. On the other hand, a\r\nbelief in all-pervading spiritual agencies seems to be universal, and\r\napparently follows from a considerable advance in man's reason and from\r\na still greater advance in his faculties of imagination, curiosity and\r\nwonder. I am aware that the assumed instinctive belief in God has been\r\nused by many persons as an argument for His existence. But this is a\r\nrash judgment, as we should thus be compelled to believe in the\r\nexistence of many cruel and malignant spirits, only a little more\r\npowerful than man; for the belief in them is far more general than in a\r\nbeneficent Deity. The idea of a universal and beneficent Creator does\r\nnot seem to arise in the mind of man until he has been elevated by\r\nlong-continued culture.\r\n\r\nHe who believes in the advancement of man from some low organized form\r\nwill naturally ask, How does this bear on the belief in the immortality\r\nof the soul? The barbarous races of man, as Sir J. Lubbock has shown,\r\npossess no clear belief of this kind; but arguments derived from the\r\nprimeval beliefs of savages are, as we have just seen, of little or no\r\navail. Few persons feel any anxiety from the impossibility of\r\ndetermining at what precise period in the development of the individual,\r\nfrom the first trace of a minute germinal vesicle, man becomes an\r\nimmortal being; and there is no greater cause for anxiety because the\r\nperiod in the gradually ascending organic scale cannot possibly be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nI am aware that the conclusions arrived at in this work will be\r\ndenounced by some as highly irreligious; but he who denounces them is\r\nbound to show why it is more irreligious to explain the origin of man as\r\na distinct species by descent from some lower form, through the laws of\r\nvariation and natural selection, than to explain the birth of the\r\nindividual through the laws of ordinary reproduction. The birth both of\r\nthe species and of the individual are equally parts of that grand\r\nsequence of events, which our minds refuse to accept as the result of\r\nblind chance. The understanding revolts at such a conclusion, whether or\r\nnot we are able to believe that every slight variation of structure, the\r\nunion of each pair in marriage, the dissemination of each seed, and\r\nother such events have all been ordained for some special purpose.\r\n\r\nSexual selection has been treated at great length in this work; for, as\r\nI have attempted to show, it has played an important part in the history\r\nof the organic world. I am aware that much remains doubtful, but I have\r\nendeavoured to give a fair view of the whole case. In the lower\r\ndivisions of the animal kingdom sexual selection seems to have done\r\nnothing; such animals are often affixed for life to the same spot, or\r\nhave the sexes combined in the same individual, or, what is still more\r\nimportant, their perceptive and intellectual faculties are not\r\nsufficiently advanced to allow of the feelings of love and jealousy, or\r\nof the exertion of choice. When, however, we come to the Arthropoda and\r\nVertebrata, even to the lowest classes in these two great sub-kingdoms,\r\nsexual selection has effected much; and it deserves notice that we here\r\nfind the intellectual faculties developed, but in two very distinct\r\nlines, to the highest standard, namely in the Hymenoptera [ants, bees,\r\netc.], among the Arthropoda [many insects, spiders, etc.], and in the\r\nMammalia, including man, among the Vertebrata.\r\n\r\nIn the most distinct classes of the animal kingdom--in mammals, birds,\r\nfishes, insects and even crustaceans--the differences between the sexes\r\nfollow almost exactly the same rules. The males are almost always the\r\nwooers; and they alone are armed with special weapons for fighting with\r\ntheir rivals. They are generally stronger and larger than the females,\r\nand are endowed with the requisite qualities of courage and pugnacity.\r\nThey are provided, either exclusively or in a much higher degree than\r\nthe females, with organs for vocal or instrumental music, and with\r\nodoriferous glands. They are ornamented with infinitely diversified\r\nappendages and with the most brilliant or conspicuous colors, often\r\narranged in elegant patterns, while the females are unadorned. When the\r\nsexes differ in more important structures it is the male which is\r\nprovided with special sense-organs for discovering the female, with\r\nlocomotive organs for reaching her, and often with prehensile organs\r\nfor holding her. These various structures for charming or securing the\r\nfemale are often developed in the male during only part of the year;\r\nnamely, the breeding season. They have in many cases been transferred in\r\na greater or less degree to the females; and in the latter case they\r\noften appear in her as mere rudiments. They are lost or never gained by\r\nthe males after emasculation. Generally they are not developed in the\r\nmale during early youth, but appear a short time before the age for\r\nreproduction. Hence, in most cases the young of both sexes resemble each\r\nother; and the female somewhat resembles her young offspring throughout\r\nlife. In almost every great class a few anomalous cases occur, where\r\nthere has been an almost complete transposition of the characters proper\r\nto the two sexes; the females assuming characters which properly belong\r\nto the males. This surprisingly uniformity in the laws regulating the\r\ndifferences between the sexes in so many and such widely separated\r\nclasses is intelligible if we admit the action throughout all the higher\r\ndivisions of the animal kingdom of one common cause; namely, sexual\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nSexual selection depends on the success of certain individuals over\r\nothers of the same sex, in relation to the propagation of the species;\r\nwhile natural selection depends on the success of both sexes, at all\r\nages, in relation to the general conditions of life. The sexual\r\nstruggle is of two kinds; in the one it is between the individuals of\r\nthe same sex, generally the males, in order to drive away or kill their\r\nrivals, the females remaining passive; while in the other, the struggle\r\nis likewise between the individuals of the same sex, in order to excite\r\nor charm those of the opposite sex, generally the females, which no\r\nlonger remain passive, but select the more agreeable partners. This\r\nlatter kind of selection is closely analogous to that which man\r\nunintentionally, yet effectually, brings to bear on his domesticated\r\nproductions, when he preserves during a long period the most pleasing or\r\nuseful individuals, without any wish to modify the breed.\r\n\r\nThe laws of inheritance determine whether characters gained through\r\nsexual selection by either sex shall be transmitted to the same sex, or\r\nto both; as well as the age at which they shall be developed. It appears\r\nthat variations arising late in life are commonly transmitted to one and\r\nthe same sex. Variability is the necessary basis for the action of\r\nselection and is wholly independent of it. It follows from this that\r\nvariations of the same general nature have often been taken advantage of\r\nand accumulated through sexual selection in relation to the propagation\r\nof the species, as well as through natural selection in relation to the\r\ngeneral purposes of life. Hence secondary sexual characters, when\r\nequally transmitted to both sexes, can be distinguished from ordinary\r\nspecific characters only by the light of analogy. The modifications\r\nacquired through sexual selection are often so strongly pronounced that\r\nthe two sexes have frequently been ranked as distinct species, or even\r\nas distinct genera. Such strongly marked differences must be in some\r\nmanner highly important; and we know that they have been acquired in\r\nsome instances at the cost not only of inconvenience, but of exposure to\r\nactual danger.\r\n\r\nThe belief in the power of sexual selection rests chiefly on the\r\nfollowing considerations: The characters which we have the best reasons\r\nfor supposing to have been thus acquired are confined to one sex; and\r\nthis alone renders it probable that in most cases they are connected\r\nwith the act of reproduction. These characters in innumerable instances\r\nare fully developed only at maturity; and often during only a part of\r\nthe year, which is always the breeding season. The males (passing over a\r\nfew exceptional cases) are the more active in courtship; they are the\r\nbest armed, and are rendered the most attractive in various ways. It is\r\nto be especially observed that the males display their attractions with\r\nelaborate care in the presence of the females; and that they rarely or\r\nnever display them excepting during the season of love. It is incredible\r\nthat all this should be purposeless. Lastly, we have distinct evidence\r\nwith some quadrupeds and birds that the individuals of one sex are\r\ncapable of feeling a strong antipathy or preference for certain\r\nindividuals of the other sex.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind these facts and not forgetting the marked results of\r\nman's unconscious selection, it seems to me almost certain that if the\r\nindividuals of one sex were during a long series of generations to\r\nprefer pairing with certain individuals of the other sex, characterized\r\nin some peculiar manner, the offspring would slowly but surely become\r\nmodified in this same manner. I have not attempted to conceal that,\r\nexcepting when the males are more numerous than the females, or when\r\npolygamy prevails, it is doubtful how the more attractive males succeed\r\nin leaving a larger number of offspring to inherit their superiority in\r\nornaments or other charms than the less attractive males; but I have\r\nshown that this would probably follow from the females--especially the\r\nmore vigorous ones, which would be the first to breed--preferring not\r\nonly the more attractive but at the same time the more vigorous and\r\nvictorious males.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have some positive evidence that birds appreciate bright and\r\nbeautiful objects, as with the bower-birds of Australia, and although\r\nthey certainly appreciate the power of song, yet I fully admit that it\r\nis astonishing that the females of many birds and some mammals should be\r\nendowed with sufficient taste to appreciate ornaments, which we have\r\nreason to attribute to sexual selection; and this is even more\r\nastonishing in the case of reptiles, fish and insects. But we really\r\nknow little about the minds of the lower animals. It cannot be supposed,\r\nfor instance, that male birds of paradise or peacocks should take such\r\npains in erecting, spreading and vibrating their beautiful plumes before\r\nthe males for no purpose. We should remember the fact given on excellent\r\nauthority in a former chapter that several peahens, when debarred from\r\nan admired male, remained widows during a whole season rather than pair\r\nwith another bird.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I know of no fact in natural history more wonderful than\r\nthat the female Argus pheasant should appreciate the exquisite shading\r\nof the ball-and-socket ornaments and the elegant patterns on the wing\r\nfeathers of the male. He who thinks that the male was created as he now\r\nexists must admit that the great plumes, which prevent the wings from\r\nbeing used for flight and which, as well as the primary feathers, are\r\ndisplayed in a manner quite peculiar to this one species during the act\r\nof courtship, and at no other time, were given to him as an ornament. If\r\nso, he must likewise admit that the female was created and endowed with\r\nthe capacity of appreciating such ornaments. I differ only in the\r\nconviction that the male Argus pheasant acquired his beauty gradually,\r\nthrough the females having preferred during many generations the more\r\nhighly ornamented males; the esthetic capacity of the females having\r\nbeen advanced through exercise or habit just as our own taste is\r\ngradually improved. In the male, through the fortunate chance of a few\r\nfeathers not having been modified, we can distinctly see how simple\r\nspots with a little fulvous [tawny] shading on one side may have been\r\ndeveloped by small steps into the wonderful ball-and-socket ornaments;\r\nand it is probable that they were actually thus developed.\r\n\r\nEvery one who admits the principle of evolution, and yet feels great\r\ndifficulty in admitting that female mammals, birds, reptiles and fish,\r\ncould have acquired the high taste implied by the beauty of the males,\r\nand which generally coincides with our own standard, should reflect that\r\nthe nerve-cells of the brain in the highest as well as in the lowest\r\nmembers of the Vertebrate series, are derived from those of the common\r\nprogenitor of the whole group. It thus becomes intelligible that the\r\nbrain and mental faculties should be capable under similar conditions of\r\nnearly the same course of development, and consequently of performing\r\nnearly the same functions.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has taken the trouble to go through the several chapters\r\ndevoted to sexual selection will be able to judge how far the\r\nconclusions at which I have arrived are supported by sufficient\r\nevidence. If he accepts these conclusions he may, I think, safely extend\r\nthem to mankind; but it would be superfluous here to repeat what I have\r\nso lately said on the manner in which sexual selection apparently has\r\nacted on man, both on the male and female side, causing the two sexes of\r\nman to differ in body and mind, and the several races to differ from\r\neach other in various characters, as well as from their ancient and\r\nlowly organized progenitors.\r\n\r\nHe who admits the principle of sexual selection will be led to the\r\nremarkable conclusion that the cerebral system not only regulates most\r\nof the existing functions of the body, but has indirectly influenced the\r\nprogressive development of various bodily structures and of certain\r\nmental qualities. Courage, pugnacity, perseverance, strength and size of\r\nbody, weapons of all kinds, musical organs, both vocal and instrumental,\r\nbright colours, stripes and marks, and ornamental appendages, have all\r\nbeen indirectly gained by the one sex or the other, through the\r\ninfluence of love and jealousy, through the appreciation of the\r\nbeautiful in sound, colour or form, and through the exertion of a\r\nchoice; and those powers of the mind manifestly depend on the\r\ndevelopment of the cerebral system.\r\n\r\nMan scans with scrupulous care the character and pedigree of his horses,\r\ncattle and dogs before he matches them; but when he comes to his own\r\nmarriage he rarely, or never takes any such care. He is impelled by\r\nnearly the same motives as the lower animals when left to their own free\r\nchoice, though he is in so far superior to them that he highly values\r\nmental charms and virtues. On the other hand he is strongly attracted\r\nby mere wealth or rank. Yet he might by selection do something not only\r\nfor the bodily constitution and frame of his offspring, but for their\r\nintellectual and moral qualities. Both sexes ought to refrain from\r\nmarriage if they are in any marked degree inferior in body or mind; but\r\nsuch hopes are Utopian and will never be even partially realized until\r\nthe laws of inheritance are thoroughly known. All do good service who\r\naid toward this end. When the principles of breeding and inheritance are\r\nbetter understood, we shall not hear ignorant members of our legislature\r\nrejecting with scorn a plan for ascertaining whether or not\r\nconsanguineous marriages are injurious to man.\r\n\r\nThe advancement of the welfare of mankind is a most intricate problem;\r\nall ought to refrain from marriage who cannot avoid abject poverty for\r\ntheir children; for poverty is not only a great evil, but tends to its\r\nown increase by leading to recklessness in marriage. On the other hand,\r\nas Mr. Galton has remarked, if the prudent avoid marriage, while the\r\nreckless marry, the inferior members tend to supplant the better members\r\nof society. Man, like every other animal, has no doubt advanced to his\r\npresent high condition through a struggle for existence consequent on\r\nhis rapid multiplication; and if he is to advance still higher, he must\r\nremain subject to a severe struggle. Otherwise he would sink into\r\nindolence, and the more gifted men would not be more successful in the\r\nbattle of life than the less gifted. Hence our natural rate of\r\nincrease, though leading to many and obvious evils, must not be greatly\r\ndiminished by any means. There should be open competition for all men;\r\nand the most able should not be prevented by laws or customs from\r\nsucceeding best and rearing the largest number of offspring. Important\r\nas the struggle for existence has been and even still is, yet as far as\r\nthe highest part of man's nature is concerned there are other agencies\r\nmore important. For the moral qualities are advanced, either directly or\r\nindirectly, much more through the effects of habit, the reasoning\r\npowers, instruction, religion, etc., than through natural selection;\r\nthough to this latter agency the social instincts, which afforded the\r\nbasis for the development of the moral sense, may be safely attributed.\r\n\r\nThe main conclusion arrived at in this work, namely, that man is\r\ndescended from some lowly organized form, will, I regret to think, be\r\nhighly distasteful to many. But there can hardly be a doubt that we are\r\ndescended from barbarians. The astonishment I felt on first seeing a\r\nparty of Fuegians on a wild and broken shore will never be forgotten by\r\nme, for the reflection at once rushed into my mind--such were our\r\nancestors. These men were absolutely naked and bedaubed with paint,\r\ntheir long hair was tangled, their mouths frothed with excitement, and\r\ntheir expression was wild, startled and distrustful. They possessed\r\nhardly any arts, and like wild animals lived on what they could catch;\r\nthey had no government, and were merciless to every one not of their\r\nown small tribe. He who has seen a savage in his native land will not\r\nfeel much shame, if forced to acknowledge that the blood of some more\r\nhumble creature flows in his veins. For my own part I would as soon be\r\ndescended from that heroic little monkey who braved his dreaded enemy in\r\norder to save the life of his keeper; or from that old baboon, who,\r\ndescending from the mountains, carried away in triumph his young comrade\r\nfrom a crowd of astonished dogs--as from a savage who delights to\r\ntorture his enemies, offers up bloody sacrifices, practises infanticide\r\nwithout remorse, treats his wives like slaves, knows no decency, and is\r\nhaunted by the grossest superstitions.\r\n\r\nMan may be excused for feeling some pride at having risen, though not\r\nthrough his own exertions, to the very summit of the organic scale; and\r\nthe fact of his having thus risen, instead of having been aboriginally\r\nplaced there, may give him hope for a still higher destiny in the\r\ndistant future. But we are not here concerned with hopes or fears, only\r\nwith the truth as far as our reason permits us to discover it. I have\r\ngiven the evidence to the best of my ability, and we must acknowledge,\r\nas it seems to me, that man, with all his noble qualities, with sympathy\r\nwhich feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not\r\nonly to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his godlike\r\nintellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of\r\nthe solar system--with all these exalted powers--Man still bears in his\r\nbodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIMICRY AND OTHER PROTECTIVE RESEMBLANCES AMONG ANIMALS\r\n\r\nALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE\r\n\r\n     [Mr. Wallace, one of the greatest naturalists of the age,\r\n     discovered the law of natural selection independently of\r\n     Darwin, and about the same time. Among his works are \"The\r\n     Malay Archipelago,\" \"Island Life,\" and \"Darwinism.\" From\r\n     \"Natural Selection,\" which was published by Macmillan & Co.,\r\n     1871, the following extracts are taken. The theme has\r\n     received important development at the hands of Professor E.\r\n     B. Poulton, in his \"The Colours of Animals,\" International\r\n     Scientific Series, 1890: and in F. E. Beddard's \"Animal\r\n     Colouration\"; London, Swan Sonnenschein; N. Y., Macmillan,\r\n     1892.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no more convincing proof of the truth of a comprehensive\r\ntheory, than its power of absorbing and finding a place for new facts,\r\nand its capability of interpreting phenomena which had been previously\r\nlooked upon as unaccountable anomalies. It is thus that the law of\r\nuniversal gravitation and the undulatory theory of light have become\r\nestablished and universally accepted by men of science. Fact after fact\r\nhas been brought forward as being apparently inconsistent with them, and\r\none after another these very facts have been shown to be the\r\nconsequences of the laws they were at first supposed to disprove. A\r\nfalse theory will never stand this test. Advancing knowledge brings to\r\nlight whole groups of facts which it cannot deal with, and its advocates\r\nsteadily decrease in numbers, notwithstanding the ability and\r\nscientific skill with which it has been supported. The course of a true\r\ntheory is very different, as may be well seen by the progress of opinion\r\non the subject of natural selection. In less than eight years \"The\r\nOrigin of Species\" has produced conviction in the minds of a majority of\r\nthe most eminent living men of science. New facts, new problems, new\r\ndifficulties as they arise are accepted, solved or removed by this\r\ntheory; and its principles are illustrated by the progress and\r\nconclusions of every well established branch of human knowledge. It is\r\nthe object of the present essay to show how it has recently been applied\r\nto connect together and explain a variety of curious facts which had\r\nlong been considered as inexplicable anomalies.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no principle has ever been announced so fertile in results as\r\nthat which Mr. Darwin so earnestly impresses upon us, and which is\r\nindeed a necessary deduction from the theory of natural selection,\r\nnamely--that none of the definite facts of organic nature, no special\r\norgan, no characteristic form or marking, no peculiarities of instinct\r\nor of habit, no relations between species or between groups of\r\nspecies--can exist, but which must now be or once have been _useful_ to\r\nthe individuals or races which possess them. This great principle gives\r\nus a clue which we can follow out in the study of many recondite\r\nphenomena, and leads us to seek a meaning and a purpose of some definite\r\ncharacter in minutiæ which we should be otherwise almost sure to pass\r\nover as insignificant or unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe adaptation of the external colouring of animals to their conditions\r\nof life has long been recognized, and has been imputed either to an\r\noriginally created specific peculiarity, or to the direct action of\r\nclimate, soil, or food. Where the former explanation has been accepted,\r\nit has completely checked inquiry, since we could never get any further\r\nthan the fact of the adaptation. There was nothing more to be known\r\nabout the matter. The second explanation was soon found to be quite\r\ninadequate to deal with all the varied phases of the phenomena, and to\r\nbe contradicted by many well-known facts. For example, wild rabbits are\r\nalways of gray or brown tints well suited for concealment among grass\r\nand fern. But when these rabbits are domesticated, without any change of\r\nclimate or food, they vary into white or black, and these varieties may\r\nbe multiplied to any extent, forming white or black races. Exactly the\r\nsame thing has occurred with pigeons; and in the case of rats and mice,\r\nthe white variety has not been shown to be at all dependent on\r\nalteration of climate, food or other external conditions. In many cases\r\nthe wings of an insect not only assume the exact tint of the bark or\r\nleaf it is accustomed to rest on, but the form and veining of the leaf\r\nor the exact rugosity of the bark is imitated; and these detailed\r\nmodifications cannot be reasonably imputed to climate or food, since in\r\nmany cases the species does not feed on the substance it resembles, and\r\nwhen it does, no reasonable connection can be shown to exist between the\r\nsupposed cause and the effect produced. It was reserved for the theory\r\nof natural selection to solve all these problems, and many others which\r\nwere not at first supposed to be directly connected with them. To make\r\nthese latter intelligible, it will be necessary to give a sketch of the\r\nwhole series of phenomena which may be classed under the head of useful\r\nor protective resemblances.\r\n\r\nConcealment, more or less complete, is useful to many animals, and\r\nabsolutely essential to some. Those which have numerous enemies from\r\nwhich they cannot escape by rapidity of motion, find safety in\r\nconcealment. Those which prey upon others must also be so constituted as\r\nnot to alarm them by their presence or their approach, or they would\r\nsoon die of hunger. Now, it is remarkable in how many cases nature gives\r\nthis boon to the animal, by colouring it with such tints as may best\r\nserve to enable it to escape from its enemies or to entrap its prey.\r\nDesert animals as a rule are desert-coloured. The lion is a typical\r\nexample of this, and must be almost invisible when crouched upon the\r\nsand or among desert rocks and stones. Antelopes are all more or less\r\nsandy-coloured. The camel is pre-eminently so. The Egyptian cat and the\r\nPampas cat are sandy or earth-coloured. The Australian kangaroos are of\r\nthe same tints, and the original colour of the wild horse is supposed\r\nto have been a sandy or clay-colour.\r\n\r\nThe desert birds are still more remarkably protected by their\r\nassimilative hues. The stone-chats, the larks, the quails, the\r\ngoatsuckers and the grouse, which abound in the North African and\r\nAsiatic deserts, are all tinted and mottled so as to resemble with\r\nwonderful accuracy the average colour and aspect of the soil in the\r\ndistrict they inhabit. The Rev. H. Tristram, in his account of the\r\nornithology of North Africa in the first volume of the \"Ibis,\" says: \"In\r\nthe desert, where neither trees, brushwood, nor even undulation of the\r\nsurface afford the slightest protection to its foes, a modification of\r\ncolour which shall be assimilated to that of the surrounding country is\r\nabsolutely necessary. Hence _without exception_ the upper plumage of\r\n_every bird_, whether lark, chat, sylvain, or sand-grouse, and also the\r\nfur of _all the smaller mammals_, and the skin of _all the snakes and\r\nlizards_, is of one uniform isabelline or sand colour.\" After the\r\ntestimony of so able an observer it is unnecessary to adduce further\r\nexamples of the protective colours of desert animals.\r\n\r\nAlmost equally striking are the cases of arctic animals possessing the\r\nwhite colour that best conceals them upon snowfields and icebergs. The\r\npolar bear is the only bear that is white, and it lives constantly among\r\nsnow and ice. The arctic fox, the ermine and the alpine hare change to\r\nwhite in winter only, because in summer white would be more conspicuous\r\nthan any other colour, and therefore a danger rather than a protection;\r\nbut the American polar hare, inhabiting regions of almost perpetual\r\nsnow, is white all the year round. Other animals inhabiting the same\r\nnorthern regions do not, however, change colour. The sable is a good\r\nexample, for throughout the severity of a Siberian winter it retains its\r\nrich brown fur. But its habits are such that it does not need the\r\nprotection of colour, for it is said to be able to subsist on fruits and\r\nberries in winter, and to be so active upon the trees as to catch small\r\nbirds among the branches. So also the woodchuck of Canada has a\r\ndark-brown fur; but then it lives in burrows and frequents river banks,\r\ncatching fish and small animals that live in or near the water.\r\n\r\nAmong birds, the ptarmigan is a fine example of protective colouring.\r\nIts summer plumage so exactly harmonizes with the lichen-coloured stones\r\namong which it delights to sit, that a person may walk through a flock\r\nof them without seeing a single bird; while in winter its white plumage\r\nis an almost equal protection. The snow-bunting, the jerfalcon, and the\r\nsnowy owl are also white-coloured birds inhabiting the arctic regions,\r\nand there can be little doubt but that their colouring is to some extent\r\nprotective.\r\n\r\nNocturnal animals supply us with equally good illustrations. Mice, rats,\r\nbats, and moles possess the least conspicuous of hues, and must be quite\r\ninvisible at times when any light colour would be instantly seen. Owls\r\nand goatsuckers are of those dark mottled tints that will assimilate\r\nwith bark and lichen, and thus protect them during the day, and at the\r\nsame time be inconspicuous in the dusk.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the tropics, among forests which never lose their foliage,\r\nthat we find whole groups of birds whose chief colour is green. The\r\nparrots are the most striking example, but we have also a group of green\r\npigeons in the East; and the barbets, leaf-thrushes, bee-eaters,\r\nwhite-eyes, turacos, and several smaller groups, have so much green in\r\ntheir plumage as to tend greatly to conceal them among the foliage.\r\n\r\nThe conformity of tint which has been so far shown to exist between\r\nanimals and their habitations is of somewhat general character; we will\r\nnow consider the cases of more special adaptation. If the lion is\r\nenabled by his sandy colour readily to conceal himself by merely\r\ncrouching down in the desert, how, it may be asked, do the elegant\r\nmarkings of the tiger, the jaguar, and the other large cats agree with\r\nthis theory? We reply that these are generally cases of more or less\r\nspecial adaptation. The tiger is a jungle animal, and hides himself\r\namong tufts of grass or of bamboos, and in these positions the vertical\r\nstripes with which his body is adorned must so assimilate with the\r\nvertical stems of the bamboo, as to assist greatly in concealing him\r\nfrom his approaching prey. How remarkable it is that besides the lion\r\nand tiger, almost all the other large cats are arboreal in their\r\nhabits, and almost all have ocellated or spotted skins, which must\r\ncertainly tend to blend them with the background of foliage; while the\r\none exception, the puma, has an ashy-brown uniform fur, and has the\r\nhabit of clinging so closely to a limb of a tree while waiting for his\r\nprey to pass beneath as to be hardly distinguishable from the bark.\r\n\r\nAmong birds, the ptarmigan, already mentioned, must be considered a\r\nremarkable case of special adaptation. Another is a South American\r\ngoatsucker (Caprimulgus rupestris) which rests in the bright sunshine on\r\nlittle bare rocky islets in the upper Rio Negro, where its unusually\r\nlight colours so closely resemble those of the rock and sand, that it\r\ncan scarcely be detected until trodden upon.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll, in his \"Reign of Law,\" has pointed out the admirable\r\nadaptation of the colours of the woodcock to its protection. The various\r\nbrowns and yellows and pale ash-colour that occur on fallen leaves are\r\nall reproduced in its plumage, so that when according to its habit it\r\nrests upon the ground under trees, it is almost impossible to detect it.\r\nIn snipes the colours are modified so as to be equally in harmony with\r\nthe prevalent forms and colours of marshy vegetation. Mr. J. M. Lester,\r\nin a paper read before the Rugby School Natural History Society\r\nobserves:--\"The wood-dove, when perched amongst the branches of its\r\nfavourite _fir_, is scarcely discernible; whereas, were it among some\r\nlighter foliage the blue and purple tints in its plumage would far\r\nsooner betray it. The robin redbreast, too, although it might be thought\r\nthat the red on its breast made it much easier to be seen, is in reality\r\nnot at all endangered by it, since it generally contrives to get among\r\nsome russet or yellow fading leaves, where the red matches very well\r\nwith the autumn tints, and the brown of the rest of the body with the\r\nbare branches.\"\r\n\r\nReptiles offer us many similar examples. The most arboreal lizards, the\r\niguanas, are as green as the leaves they feed upon, and the slender\r\nwhip-snakes are rendered almost invisible as they glide among the\r\nfoliage by a similar colouration. How difficult it is sometimes to catch\r\nsight of the little green tree-frogs sitting on the leaves of a small\r\nplant enclosed in a glass case in the Zoological Gardens; yet how much\r\nbetter concealed they must be among the fresh green damp foliage of a\r\nmarshy forest. There is a North American frog found on lichen-covered\r\nrocks and walls, which is so coloured as exactly to resemble them, and\r\nas long as it remains quiet would certainly escape detection. Some of\r\nthe geckos which cling motionless on the trunks of trees in the tropics,\r\nare of such curiously marbled colours as to match exactly with the bark\r\nthey rest upon.\r\n\r\nIn every part of the tropics there are tree snakes that twist among\r\nboughs and shrubs, or lie coiled up in the dense masses of foliage.\r\nThese are of many distinct groups, and comprise both venomous and\r\nharmless genera; but almost all of them are of a beautiful green colour,\r\nsometimes more or less adorned with white or dusky bands and spots.\r\nThere can be little doubt that this colour is doubly useful to them,\r\nsince it will tend to conceal them from their enemies, and will lead\r\ntheir prey to approach them unconscious of danger. Dr. Gunthner informs\r\nme that there is only one genus of true arboreal snakes (Dipsas) whose\r\ncolours are rarely green, but are of various shades of black, brown, and\r\nolive, and these are all nocturnal reptiles, and there can be little\r\ndoubt conceal themselves during the day in holes, so that the green\r\nprotective tint would be useless to them, and they accordingly retain\r\nthe more usual reptilian hues.\r\n\r\nFishes present similar instances. Many flat fish, as, for example, the\r\nflounder and the skate, are exactly the colour of the gravel or sand on\r\nwhich they habitually rest. Among the marine flower gardens of an\r\nEastern coral reef the fishes present every variety of gorgeous colour,\r\nwhile the river fish even of the tropics rarely if ever have gay or\r\nconspicuous markings. A very curious case of this kind of adaptation\r\noccurs in the sea-horse (Hippocampus) of Australia, some of which bear\r\nlong foliaceous appendages resembling seaweed, and are of a brilliant\r\nred colour; and they are known to live among seaweed of the same hue, so\r\nthat when at rest they must be quite invisible. There are now in the\r\naquarium of the Zoological Society some slender green pipe-fish which\r\nfasten themselves to any object at the bottom by their prehensile tails,\r\nand float about with the current, looking exactly like some cylindrical\r\nalgæ.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in the insect world that this principle of the\r\nadaptation of animals to their environment is most fully and strikingly\r\ndeveloped. In order to understand how general this is, it is necessary\r\nto enter somewhat into details, as we shall thereby be better able to\r\nappreciate the significance of the still more remarkable phenomena we\r\nshall presently have to discuss. It seems to be in proportion to their\r\nsluggish motions or the absence of other means of defence, that insects\r\npossess the protective colouring. In the tropics there are thousands of\r\nspecies of insects which rest during the day clinging to the bark of\r\ndead or fallen trees; and the greater portion of these are delicately\r\nmottled with gray and brown tints, which though symmetrically disposed\r\nand infinitely varied, yet blend so completely with the usual colours of\r\nthe bark that at two or three feet distance they are quite\r\nundistinguishable. In some cases a species is known to frequent only one\r\nspecies of tree. This is the case with the common South American\r\nlong-horned beetle (Onychocerus scorpio) which, Mr. Bates informed me,\r\nis found only on a rough-barked tree, called Tapiriba, on the Amazon. It\r\nis very abundant, but so exactly does it resemble the bark in colour and\r\nrugosity, and so closely does it cling to the branches, that until it\r\nmoves it is absolutely invisible! An allied species (O. concentricus) is\r\nfound only at Para, on a distinct species of tree, the bark of which it\r\nresembles with equal accuracy. Both these insects are abundant, and we\r\nmay fairly conclude that the protection they derive from this strange\r\nconcealment is at least one of the causes that enable the race to\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\nMany of the species of Cicindela, or tiger beetle, will illustrate this\r\nmode of protection. Our common Cicindela campestris frequents grassy\r\nbanks and is of a beautiful green colour, while C. maritima, which is\r\nfound only on sandy sea-shores, is of a pale bronzy yellow, so as to be\r\nalmost invisible. A great number of the species found by myself in the\r\nMalay islands are similarly protected. The beautiful Cicindela gloriosa,\r\nof a very deep velvety green colour, was only taken upon wet mossy\r\nstones in the bed of a mountain stream, where it was with the greatest\r\ndifficulty detected. A large brown species (C. heros) was found chiefly\r\non dead leaves in forest paths; and one which was never seen except on\r\nthe wet mud of salt marshes was of a glossy olive so exactly the colour\r\nof the mud as only to be distinguished when the sun shone, by its\r\nshadow! Where the sandy beach was coralline and nearly white, I found a\r\nvery pale Cicindela; wherever it was volcanic and black, a dark species\r\nof the same genus was sure to be met with.\r\n\r\nThere are in the East small beetles of the family Buprestidæ which\r\ngenerally rest on the midrib of a leaf, and the naturalist often\r\nhesitates before picking them off, so closely do they resemble pieces of\r\nbird's dung. Kirby and Spence mention the small beetle Onthophilus\r\nsulcatus as being like the seed of an umbelliferous plant; and another\r\nsmall weevil, which is much persecuted by predatory beetles of the genus\r\nHarpalus, is of the exact colour of loamy soil, and was found to be\r\nparticularly abundant in loam pits. Mr. Bates mentions a small beetle\r\n(Chlamys pilula) which was undistinguishable by the eye from the dung of\r\ncaterpillars, while some of the Cassidæ, from their hemispherical forms\r\nand pearly gold-colour, resemble glittering dew-drops upon the leaves.\r\n\r\nA number of our small brown and speckled weevils at the approach of any\r\nobject roll off the leaf they are sitting on, at the same time drawing\r\nin their legs and antennæ, which fit so perfectly into cavities for\r\ntheir reception that the insect becomes a mere oval brownish lump, which\r\nit is hopeless to look for among the similarly coloured little stones\r\nand earth pellets among which it lies motionless.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of colour in butterflies and moths respectively is very\r\ninstructive from this point of view. The former have all their brilliant\r\ncolouring on the upper surface of all four wings, while the under\r\nsurface is almost always soberly coloured, and often very dark and\r\nobscure. The moths on the contrary have generally their chief colour on\r\nthe hind wings only, the upper wings being of dull, sombre, and often\r\nimitative tints, and these generally conceal the hind wings when the\r\ninsects are in repose. This arrangement of the colours is therefore\r\neminently protective, because the butterfly always rests with his wings\r\nraised so as to conceal the dangerous brilliancy of his upper surface.\r\nIt is probable that if we watched their habits sufficiently we should\r\nfind the under surface of the wings of butterflies very frequently\r\nimitative and protective. Mr. T. W. Wood has pointed out that the little\r\norange-tip butterfly often rests in the evening on the green and white\r\nflower heads of an umbelliferous plant, and that when observed in this\r\nposition the beautiful green and white mottling of the under surface\r\ncompletely assimilates with the flower heads and renders the creature\r\nvery difficult to be seen. It is probable that the rich dark colouring\r\nof the under side of our peacock, tortoiseshell, and red-admiral\r\nbutterflies answers a similar purpose.\r\n\r\nTwo curious South American butterflies that always settle on the trunks\r\nof trees (Gynecia dirce and Callizona acesta) have the under surface\r\ncuriously striped and mottled, and when viewed obliquely must closely\r\nassimilate with the appearance of the furrowed bark of many kinds of\r\ntrees. But the most wonderful and undoubted case of protective\r\nresemblance in a butterfly which I have ever seen, is that of the\r\ncommon Indian Kallima inachis, and its Malayan ally, Kallima paralekta.\r\nThe upper surface of these insects is very striking and showy, as they\r\nare of a large size, and are adorned with a broad band of rich orange on\r\na deep bluish ground. The under side is very variable in colour, so that\r\nout of fifty specimens no two can be found exactly alike, but every one\r\nof them will be of some shade of ash or brown or ochre, such as are\r\nfound among dead, dry or decaying leaves. The apex of the upper wings is\r\nproduced into an acute point, a very common form in the leaves of\r\ntropical shrubs and trees, and the lower wings are also produced into a\r\nshort, narrow tail. Between these two points runs a dark curved line\r\nexactly representing the midrib of a leaf, and from this radiate on each\r\nside a few oblique lines, which serve to indicate the lateral veins of a\r\nleaf. These marks are more clearly seen on the outer portion of the base\r\nof the wings, and on the inner side towards the middle and apex, and it\r\nis very curious to observe how the usual marginal and transverse striæ\r\nof the group are here modified and strengthened so as to become adapted\r\nfor an imitation of the venation of a leaf. We come now to a still more\r\nextraordinary part of the imitation, for we find representations of\r\nleaves in every stage of decay, variously blotched and mildewed and\r\npierced with powdery black dots gathered into patches and spots, so\r\nclosely resembling the various kinds of minute fungi that grow on dead\r\nleaves that is it impossible to avoid thinking at first sight that the\r\nbutterflies themselves have been attacked by real fungi.\r\n\r\nBut this resemblance, close as it is, would be little use if the habits\r\nof the insect did not accord with it. If the butterfly sat upon leaves\r\nor upon flowers, or opened its wings so as to expose the upper surface,\r\nor exposed and moved its head and antennæ as many other butterflies do,\r\nits disguise would be of little avail. We might be sure, however, from\r\nthe analogy of many other cases, that the habits of the insect are such\r\nas still further to aid its deceptive garb; but we are not obliged to\r\nmake any such supposition, since I myself had the good fortune to\r\nobserve scores of Kallima paralekta, in Sumatra, and to capture many of\r\nthem, and can vouch for the accuracy of the following details: These\r\nbutterflies frequent dry forests and fly very swiftly. They were never\r\nseen to settle on a flower or a green leaf, but were many times lost\r\nsight of in a bush or tree of dead leaves. On such occasions they were\r\ngenerally searched for in vain, for while gazing intently at the very\r\nspot where one had disappeared, it would often suddenly dart out and\r\nagain vanish twenty or fifty yards further on. On one or two occasions\r\nthe insect was detected reposing, and it could then be seen how\r\ncompletely it assimilates itself to the surrounding leaves. It sits on\r\na nearly upright twig, the wings fitting closely back to back,\r\nconcealing the antennæ and head, which are drawn up between their bases.\r\nThe little tails of the hind wings touch the branch and form a perfect\r\nstalk to the leaf, which is supported in its place by the claws of the\r\nmiddle pair of feet, which are slender and inconspicuous. The irregular\r\noutline of the wings gives exactly the perspective effect of a\r\nshrivelled leaf. We thus have size, colour, form, markings, and habits,\r\nall combining together to produce a disguise which may be said to be\r\nabsolutely perfect; and the protection which it affords is sufficiently\r\nindicated by the abundance of the individuals that possess it....\r\n\r\nWe will now endeavour to show how these wonderful resemblances have most\r\nprobably been brought about. Returning to the higher animals, let us\r\nconsider the remarkable fact of the rarity of white colouring in the\r\nmammalia or birds of the temperate or tropical zones in a state of\r\nnature. There is not a single white land-bird or quadruped in Europe,\r\nexcept the few arctic or alpine species to which white is a protective\r\ncolour. Yet in many of these creatures there seems to be no inherent\r\ntendency to avoid white, for directly they are domesticated white\r\nvarieties arise, and appear to thrive as well as others. We have white\r\nmice and rats, white cats, horses, dogs, and cattle, white poultry,\r\npigeons, turkeys, and ducks, and white rabbits. Some of these animals\r\nhave been domesticated for a long period, others only for a few\r\ncenturies; but in almost every case in which an animal has been\r\nthoroughly domesticated, parti-coloured and white varieties are produced\r\nand become permanent.\r\n\r\nIt is also well known that animals in a state of nature produce white\r\nvarieties occasionally. Blackbirds, starlings, and crows are\r\noccasionally seen white, as well as elephants, deer, tigers, hares,\r\nmoles, and many other animals; but in no case is a permanent white race\r\nproduced. Now there are no statistics to show that the normal-coloured\r\nparents produce white offspring oftener under domestication than in a\r\nstate of nature, and we have no right to make such an assumption if the\r\nfacts can be accounted for without it. But if the colours of animals do\r\nreally, in the various instances already adduced, serve for their\r\nconcealment and preservation, then white or any other conspicuous colour\r\nmust be hurtful, and must in most cases shorten an animal's life. A\r\nwhite rabbit would be more surely the prey of hawk or buzzard, and the\r\nwhite mole, or field mouse, could not long escape from the vigilant owl.\r\nSo, also, any deviation from those tints best adapted to conceal a\r\ncarnivorous animal would render the pursuit of its prey much more\r\ndifficult, would place it at a disadvantage among its fellows and in a\r\ntime of scarcity would probably cause it to starve to death. On the\r\nother hand, if an animal spreads from a temperate into an arctic\r\ndistrict, the conditions are changed. During a large portion of the\r\nyear, and just when the struggle for existence is most severe, white is\r\nthe prevailing tint of nature, and dark colours will be the most\r\nconspicuous. The white varieties will now have an advantage; they will\r\nescape from their enemies or will secure food, while their brown\r\ncompanions will be devoured or will starve; and \"as like produces like\"\r\nis the established rule in nature, the white race will become\r\npermanently established, and dark varieties, when they occasionally\r\nappear, will soon die out from their want of adaptation to their\r\nenvironment. In each case the fittest will survive, and a race will be\r\neventually produced adapted to the conditions in which it lives.\r\n\r\nWe have here an illustration of the simple and effectual means by which\r\nanimals are brought into harmony with the rest of nature. That slight\r\namount of variability in every species, which we often look upon as\r\nsomething accidental or abnormal, or so insignificant as to be hardly\r\nworthy of notice, is yet the foundation of all those wonderful and\r\nharmonious resemblances which play such an important part in the economy\r\nof nature. Variation is generally very small in amount, but it is all\r\nthat is required, because the change in the external conditions to which\r\nan animal is subject is generally very slow and intermittent. When\r\nthese changes have taken place too rapidly, the result has often been\r\nthe extinction of species; but the general rule is, that climatal and\r\ngeological changes go on slowly, and the slight but continual variations\r\nin the colour, form and structure of all animals, has furnished\r\nindividuals adapted to these changes, and who have become the\r\nprogenitors of modified races. Rapid multiplication, incessant slight\r\nvariation, and survival of the fittest--these are the laws which ever\r\nkeep the organic world in harmony with the inorganic and with itself.\r\nThese are the laws which we believe have produced all the cases of\r\nprotective resemblance already adduced, as well as those still more\r\ncurious examples we have yet to bring before our readers.\r\n\r\nIt must always be borne in mind that the more wonderful examples, in\r\nwhich there is not only a general but a special resemblance as in the\r\nwalking leaf, the mossy phasma, and the leaf-winged butterfly--represent\r\nthose few instances in which the process of modification has been going\r\non during an immense series of generations. They all occur in the\r\ntropics, where the conditions of existence are the most favourable, and\r\nwhere climatic changes have for long periods been hardly perceptible. In\r\nmost of them favourable variations both of colour, form, structure, and\r\ninstinct or habit, must have occurred to produce the perfect adaptation\r\nwe now behold. All these are known to vary, and favourable variations\r\nwhen not accompanied by others that are unfavourable, would certainly\r\nsurvive. At one time a little step might be made in this direction, at\r\nanother time in that--a change of conditions might sometimes render\r\nuseless that which it had taken ages to produce--great and sudden\r\nphysical modifications might often produce the extinction of a race just\r\nas it was approaching perfection, and a hundred checks of which we can\r\nknow nothing may have retarded the progress towards perfect adaptation;\r\nso that we can hardly wonder at there being so few cases in which a\r\ncompletely successful result has been attained as shown by the abundance\r\nand wide diffusion of the creatures so protected.\r\n\r\n[Here are given many detailed examples of insects which gainfully mimic\r\none another.]\r\n\r\nWe will now adduce a few cases in which beetles imitate other insects,\r\nand insects of other orders imitate beetles.\r\n\r\nCharis melipona, a South American Longicorn of the family Necydalidæ,\r\nhas been so named from its resemblance to a small bee of the genus\r\nMelipona. It is one of the most remarkable cases of mimicry, since the\r\nbeetle has the thorax and body densely hairy like the bee, and the legs\r\nare tufted in a manner most unusual in the order Coleoptera. Another\r\nLongicorn, Odontocera odyneroides, has the abdomen banded with yellow,\r\nand constricted at the base, and is altogether so exactly like a small\r\ncommon wasp of the genus Odynerus, that Mr. Bates informs us he was\r\nafraid to take it out of his net with his fingers for fear of being\r\nstung. Had Mr. Bates's taste for insects been less omnivorous than it\r\nwas, the beetle's disguise might have saved it from his pin, as it had\r\nno doubt often done from the beak of hungry birds. A larger insect,\r\nSphecomorpha chalybea, is exactly like one of the large metallic blue\r\nwasps, and like them has the abdomen connected with the thorax by a\r\npedicle, rendering the deception most complete and striking. Many\r\nEastern species of Longicorns of the genus Oberea, when on the wing\r\nexactly resemble Tenthredinidæ, and many of the small species of\r\nHesthesis run about on timber, and cannot be distinguished from ants.\r\nThere is one genus of South American Longicorns that appears to mimic\r\nthe shielded bugs of the genus Scutellera. The Gymnocerous capucinus is\r\none of these, and is very like Pachyotris fabricii, one of the\r\nScutelleridæ. The beautiful Gymnocerous dulcissimus is also very like\r\nthe same group of insects, though there is no known species that exactly\r\ncorresponds to it; but this is not to be wondered at, as the tropical\r\nHemiptera have been comparatively so little cared for by collectors.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable case of an insect of another order mimicking a\r\nbeetle is that of the Condylodera tricondyloides, one of the cricket\r\nfamily from the Philippine Islands, which is so exactly like a\r\nTricondyla (one of the tiger beetles), that such an experienced\r\nentomologist as Professor Westwood placed it among them in his cabinet,\r\nand retained it there a long time before he discovered his mistake! Both\r\ninsects run along the trunks of trees, and whereas Tricondylas are very\r\nplentiful, the insect that mimics it is, as in all other cases, very\r\nrare. Mr. Bates also informs us that he found at Santarem on the Amazon,\r\na species of locust which mimicked one of the tiger beetles of the genus\r\nOdontocheila, and was found on the same trees which they frequented.\r\n\r\nThere are a considerable number of Diptera, or two-winged flies, that\r\nclosely resemble wasps and bees, and no doubt derive much benefit from\r\nthe wholesome dread which those insects excite. The Midas dives, and\r\nother species of large Brazilian flies, have dark wings and metallic\r\nblue elongate bodies, resembling the large stinging Sphegidæ of the same\r\ncountry; and a very large fly of the genus Asilus has black-banded wings\r\nand the abdomen tipped with rich orange, so as exactly to resemble the\r\nfine bee Euglossa dimidiata, and both are found in the same parts of\r\nSouth America. We have also in our own country species of Bombylius\r\nwhich are almost exactly like bees. In these cases the end gained by the\r\nmimicry is no doubt freedom from attack, but it has sometimes an\r\naltogether different purpose. There are a number of parasitic flies\r\nwhose larvæ feed upon the larvæ of bees, such as the British genus\r\nVolucella and many of the tropical Bombylii, and most of these are\r\nexactly like the particular species of bee they prey upon, so that they\r\ncan enter their nests unsuspected to deposit their eggs. There are also\r\nbees that mimic bees. The cuckoo bees of the genus Nomada are parasitic\r\non the Andrenidæ, and they resemble either wasps or species of Andrena;\r\nand the parasitic humble-bees of the genus Apathus almost exactly\r\nresemble the species of humble-bees in whose nests they are reared. Mr.\r\nBates informs us that he found numbers of these \"cuckoo\" bees and flies\r\non the Amazon, which all wore the livery of working bees peculiar to the\r\nsame country.\r\n\r\nThere is a genus of small spiders in the tropics which feed on ants, and\r\nthey are exactly like ants themselves, which no doubt gives them more\r\nopportunity of seizing their prey; and Mr. Bates found on the Amazon a\r\nspecies of Mantis which exactly resembled the white ants which it fed\r\nupon, as well as several species of crickets (Saphura), which resembled\r\nin a wonderful manner different sand-wasps of large size, which are\r\nconstantly on the search for crickets with which to provision their\r\nnests.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most wonderful case of all is the large caterpillar\r\nmentioned by Mr. Bates, which startled him by its close resemblance to a\r\nsmall snake. The first three segments behind the head were dilatable at\r\nthe will of the insect, and had on each side a large black pupillated\r\nspot, which resembled the eye of the reptile. Moreover, it resembled a\r\npoisonous viper, not a harmless species of snake, as was proved by the\r\nimitation of keeled scales on the crown produced by the recumbent feet,\r\nas the caterpillar threw itself backward!\r\n\r\nThe attitudes of many of the tropical spiders are most extraordinary and\r\ndeceptive, but little attention has been paid to them. They often mimic\r\nother insects, and some, Mr. Bates assures us, are exactly like flower\r\nbuds, and take their station in the axils of leaves, where they remain\r\nmotionless waiting for their prey.\r\n\r\nI have now completed a brief, and necessarily very imperfect, survey of\r\nthe various ways in which the external form and colouring of animals is\r\nadapted to be useful to them, either by concealing them from their\r\nenemies or from the creatures they prey upon. It has, I hope, been shown\r\nthat the subject is one of much interest, both as regard a true\r\ncomprehension of the place each animal fills in the economy of nature,\r\nand the means by which it is enabled to maintain that place; and also as\r\nteaching us how important a part is played by the minutest details in\r\nthe structure of animals, and how complicated and delicate is the\r\nequilibrium of the organic world.\r\n\r\nMy exposition of the subject having been necessarily somewhat lengthy\r\nand full of details, it will be as well to recapitulate its main\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThere is a general harmony in nature between the colours of an animal\r\nand those of its habitation. Arctic animals are white, desert animals\r\nare sand-coloured; dwellers among leaves and grass are green; nocturnal\r\nanimals are dusky. These colours are not universal, but are very\r\ngeneral, and are seldom reversed. Going on a little further, we find\r\nbirds, reptiles and insects, so tinted and mottled as exactly to match\r\nthe rock, or bark, or leaf, or flower they are accustomed to rest\r\nupon--and thereby effectually concealed. Another step in advance, and we\r\nhave insects which are formed as well as coloured so as exactly to\r\nresemble particular leaves, or sticks, or mossy twigs, or flowers; and\r\nin these cases very peculiar habits and instincts come into play to aid\r\nin the deception and render the concealment more complete. We now enter\r\nupon a new phase of the phenomena, and come to creatures whose colours\r\nneither conceal them nor make them like vegetable or mineral substances;\r\non the contrary, they are conspicuous enough, but they completely\r\nresemble some other creature of a quite different group, while they\r\ndiffer much in outward appearance from those with which all essential\r\nparts of their organization show them to be really closely allied. They\r\nappear like actors or masqueraders dressed up and painted for amusement,\r\nor like swindlers endeavouring to pass themselves off for well-known and\r\nrespectable members of society. What is the meaning of this strange\r\ntravesty? Does nature descend to imposture or masquerade? We answer, she\r\ndoes not. Her principles are too severe. There is a use in every detail\r\nof her handiwork. The resemblance of one animal to another is of exactly\r\nthe same essential nature as the resemblance to a leaf, or to bark, or\r\nto desert sand, and answers exactly the same purpose. In the one case\r\nthe enemy will not attack the leaf or the bark, and so the disguise is a\r\nsafeguard; in the other case it is found that for various reasons the\r\ncreature resembled is passed over, and not attacked by the usual enemies\r\nof its order, and thus the creature that resembles it has an equally\r\neffectual safeguard. We are plainly shown that the disguise is of the\r\nsame nature in the two cases, by the occurrence in the same group of one\r\nspecies resembling a vegetable substance, while another resembles a\r\nliving animal of another group; and we know that the creatures resembled\r\npossess an immunity from attack, by their being always very abundant, by\r\ntheir being conspicuous and not concealing themselves, and by their\r\nhaving generally no visible means of escape from their enemies; while,\r\nat the same time, the particular quality that makes them disliked is\r\noften very clear, such as a nasty taste or an indigestible hardness.\r\nFurther examination reveals the fact that, in several cases of both\r\nkinds of disguise, it is the female only that is thus disguised; and as\r\nit can be shown that the female needs protection much more than the\r\nmale, and that her preservation for a much longer period is absolutely\r\nnecessary for the continuance of the race, we have an additional\r\nindication that the resemblance is in all cases subservient to a great\r\npurpose--the preservation of the species.\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to explain these phenomena as having been brought about\r\nby variation and natural selection, we start with the fact that white\r\nvarieties frequently occur, and when protected from enemies show no\r\nincapacity for continued existence and increase. We know, further, that\r\nvarieties of many other tints occasionally occur; and as \"the survival\r\nof the fittest\" must inevitably weed out those whose colours are\r\nprejudicial and preserve those whose colours are a safeguard, we require\r\nno other mode of accounting for the protective tints of arctic and\r\ndesert animals. But this being granted, there is such a perfectly\r\ncontinuous and graduated series of examples of every kind of protective\r\nimitation, up to the most wonderful cases of what is termed \"mimicry,\"\r\nthat we can find no place at which to draw the line and say,--so far\r\nvariation and natural selection will account for the phenomena, but for\r\nall the rest we require a more potent cause. The counter theories that\r\nhave been proposed, that of the \"special creation\" of each imitative\r\nform, that of the action of similar \"conditions of existence\" for some\r\nof the cases, and of the laws of \"hereditary descent and the reversion\r\nto ancestral forms\" for others,--have all been shown to be beset with\r\ndifficulties, and the two latter to be directly contradicted by some of\r\nthe most constant and most remarkable of the facts to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe important part that protective \"resemblance\" has played in\r\ndetermining the colours and markings of many groups of animals will\r\nenable us to understand the meaning of one of the most striking facts in\r\nnature, the uniformity in the colours of the vegetable as compared with\r\nthe wonderful diversity of the animal world. There appears no good\r\nreason why trees and shrubs should not have been adorned with as many\r\nvaried hues and as strikingly designed patterns as birds and\r\nbutterflies, since the gay colours of flowers show that there is no\r\nincapacity in vegetable tissues to exhibit them. But even flowers\r\nthemselves present us with none of those wonderful designs, those\r\ncomplicated arrangements of stripes and dots and patches of colour, that\r\nharmonious blending of hues in lines and bands and shaded spots, which\r\nare so general a feature in insects. It is the opinion of Mr. Darwin\r\nthat we owe much of the beauty of flowers to the necessity of attracting\r\ninsects to aid in their fertilization, and that much of the development\r\nof colour in the animal world is due to \"sexual selection,\" colour being\r\nuniversally attractive, and thus leading to its propagation and\r\nincrease; but while fully admitting this, it will be evident from the\r\nfacts and arguments here brought forward, that very much of the\r\n_variety_ both of colour and markings among animals is due to the\r\nsupreme importance of concealment, and thus the various tints of\r\nminerals and vegetables have been directly reproduced in the animal\r\nkingdom, and again and again modified as more special protection became\r\nnecessary. We shall thus have two causes for the development of colour\r\nin the animal world and shall be better enabled to understand how, by\r\ntheir combined and separate action, the immense variety we now behold\r\nhas been produced. Both causes, however, will come under the general law\r\nof \"Utility,\" the advocacy of which, in its broadest sense, we owe\r\nalmost entirely to Mr. Darwin. A more accurate knowledge of the varied\r\nphenomena connected with this subject may not improbably give us some\r\ninformation both as to the senses and the mental faculties of the lower\r\nanimals. For it is evident that if colours which please us also attract\r\nthem, and if the various disguises which have been here enumerated are\r\nequally deceptive to them as to ourselves, then both their powers of\r\nvision and their faculties of perception and emotion, must be\r\nessentially of the same nature as our own--a fact of high philosophical\r\nimportance in the study of our own nature and our true relations to the\r\nlower animals.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] The author continues this study in Chapter ix of \"Darwinism\": New\r\nYork, Macmillan Co., 1889.--Ed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HENRY HUXLEY\r\n\r\n     [Professor Huxley as a naturalist, educator, and\r\n     controversialist was one of the commanding figures of the\r\n     nineteenth century. To physiology and morphology his\r\n     researches added much of importance: as an expositor he stood\r\n     unapproached. As the bold and witty champion of Darwinism he\r\n     gave natural selection an acceptance much more early and wide\r\n     than it would otherwise have enjoyed. In 1876 he delivered in\r\n     America three lectures on Evolution: the third of the series\r\n     is here given. All three are copyrighted and published by D.\r\n     Appleton & Co., New York, in a volume which also contains a\r\n     lecture on the study of biology. Since 1876 the arguments of\r\n     Professor Huxley have been reinforced by the discovery of\r\n     many fossils connecting not only the horse, but other\r\n     quadrupeds, with species widely different and now extinct.\r\n     The most comprehensive collection illustrating the descent of\r\n     the horse is to be seen at the American Museum of Natural\r\n     History, New York, where also the evolution of tapirs,\r\n     camels, llamas, rhinoceroses, dinosaurs, great ground sloths\r\n     and other animals are clearly to be traced--in most cases by\r\n     remains discovered in America. A capital book on the theme\r\n     broached by Professor Huxley is \"Animals of the Past,\" by\r\n     Frederic A. Lucas, Curator of the Division of Comparative\r\n     Anatomy, United States National Museum, Washington, D. C.,\r\n     published by McClure, Phillips & Co., New York.\r\n\r\n     \"The Life and Letters of Professor Huxley,\" edited by his\r\n     son, Leonard Huxley, is a work of rare interest: it is\r\n     published by D. Appleton & Co., New York.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of historical facts is said to be demonstrated, when the\r\nevidence that they happened is of such a character as to render the\r\nassumption that they did not happen in the highest degree improbable;\r\nand the question I now have to deal with is, whether evidence in favour\r\nof the evolution of animals of this degree of cogency is, or is not,\r\nobtainable from the record of the succession of living forms which is\r\npresented to us by fossil remains.\r\n\r\nThose who have attended to the progress of palæontology are aware that\r\nevidence of the character which I have defined has been produced in\r\nconsiderable and continually-increasing quantity during the last few\r\nyears. Indeed, the amount and the satisfactory nature of that evidence\r\nare somewhat surprising, when we consider the conditions under which\r\nalone we can hope to obtain it.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously useless to seek for such evidence, except in localities\r\nin which the physical conditions have been such as to permit of the\r\ndeposit of an unbroken, or but rarely interrupted, series of strata\r\nthrough a long period of time; in which the group of animals to be\r\ninvestigated has existed in such abundance as to furnish the requisite\r\nsupply of remains; and in which, finally, the materials composing the\r\nstrata are such as to insure the preservation of these remains in a\r\ntolerably perfect and undisturbed state.\r\n\r\nIt so happens that the case which, at present, most nearly fulfils all\r\nthese conditions is that of the series of extinct animals which\r\nculminates in the horses; by which term I mean to denote not merely the\r\ndomestic animals with which we are all so well acquainted, but their\r\nallies, the ass, zebra, quagga, and the like. In short, I use \"horses\"\r\nas the equivalent of the technical name _Equidæ_, which is applied to\r\nthe whole group of existing equine animals.\r\n\r\nThe horse is in many ways a remarkable animal; not least so in the fact\r\nthat it presents us with an example of one of the most perfect pieces of\r\nmachinery in the living world. In truth, among the works of human\r\ningenuity it cannot be said that there is any locomotive so perfectly\r\nadapted to its purposes, doing so much work with so small a quantity of\r\nfuel, as this machine of nature's manufacture--the horse. And, as a\r\nnecessary consequence of any sort of perfection, of mechanical\r\nperfection as of others, you find that the horse is a beautiful\r\ncreature, one of the most beautiful of all land animals. Look at the\r\nperfect balance of its form, and the rhythm and force of its action. The\r\nlocomotive machinery is, as you are aware, resident in its slender fore\r\nand hind limbs; they are flexible and elastic levers, capable of being\r\nmoved by very powerful muscles; and, in order to supply the engines\r\nwhich work these levers with the force which they expend, the horse is\r\nprovided with a very perfect apparatus for grinding its food and\r\nextracting therefrom the requisite fuel.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to take you very far into the region of osteological\r\ndetail, I must nevertheless trouble you with some statements respecting\r\nthe anatomical structure of the horse; and, more especially, will it be\r\nneedful to obtain a general conception of the structure of its fore and\r\nhind limbs, and of its teeth. But I shall only touch upon these points\r\nwhich are absolutely essential to our inquiry.\r\n\r\nLet us turn in the first place to the fore-limb. In most quadrupeds, as\r\nin ourselves, the fore-arms contains distinct bones called the radius\r\nand the ulna. The corresponding region in the horse seem at first to\r\npossess but one bone. Careful observation, however, enables us to\r\ndistinguish in this bone a part which clearly answers to the upper end\r\nof the ulna. This is closely united with the chief mass of the bone\r\nwhich represents the radius, and runs out into a slender shaft which may\r\nbe traced for some distance downwards upon the back of the radius, and\r\nthen in most cases thins out and vanishes. It takes still more trouble\r\nto make sure of what is nevertheless the fact, that a small part of the\r\nlower end of the bone of the horse's fore-arm, which is only distinct in\r\na very young foal, is really the lower extremity of the ulna.\r\n\r\nWhat is commonly called the knee of a horse is its wrist. The \"cannon\r\nbone\" answers to the middle bone of the five metacarpal bones, which\r\nsupport the palm of the hand in ourselves. The \"pastern,\" \"coronary,\"\r\nand \"coffin\" bones of veterinarians answer to the joints of our middle\r\nfingers, while the hoof is simply a greatly enlarged and thickened nail.\r\nBut if what lies below the horse's \"knee\" thus corresponds to the middle\r\nfinger in ourselves, what has become of the four other fingers or\r\ndigits? We find in the places of the second and fourth digits only two\r\nslender splint-like bones, about two-thirds as long as the cannon bone,\r\nwhich gradually taper to their lower ends and bear no finger joints, or,\r\nas they are termed, phalanges. Sometimes, small bony or gristly nodules\r\nare to be found at the bases of these two metacarpal splints, and it is\r\nprobable that these represent rudiments of the first and fifth toes.\r\nThus, the part of the horse's skeleton, which corresponds with that of\r\nthe human hand, contains one overgrown middle digit, and at least two\r\nimperfect lateral digits; and these answer, respectively, to the third,\r\nthe second and the fourth fingers in man.\r\n\r\nCorresponding modifications are found in the hind limb. In ourselves,\r\nand in most quadrupeds, the leg contains two distinct bones, a large\r\nbone, the tibia, and a smaller and more slender bone, the fibula. But,\r\nin the horse, the fibula seems, at first, to be reduced to its upper\r\nend; a short slender bone united with the tibia and ending in a point\r\nbelow, occupying its place. Examination of the lower end of a young\r\nfoal's shin-bone, however, shows a distinct portion of osseous matter,\r\nwhich is the lower end of the fibula; so that the, apparently single,\r\nlower end of the shin-bone is really made up of the coalesced ends of\r\nthe tibia and fibula, just as the, apparently single, lower end of the\r\nfore-arm bone is composed of the coalesced radius and ulna.\r\n\r\nThe heel of the horse is the part commonly known as the hock. The hinder\r\ncannon bone answers to the middle metatarsal bone of the human foot, the\r\npastern, coronary, and coffin bones, to the middle toe bones; the hind\r\nhoof to the nail; as in the fore-foot. And, as in the fore-foot, there\r\nare merely two splints to represent the second and the fourth toes.\r\nSometimes a rudiment of a fifth toe appears to be traceable.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of a horse are not less peculiar than its limbs. The living\r\nengine, like all others, must be well stoked if it is to do its work;\r\nand the horse, if it is to make good its wear and tear, and to exert the\r\nenormous amount of force required for its propulsion, must be well and\r\nrapidly fed. To this end good cutting instruments and powerful and\r\nlasting crushers are needful. Accordingly, the twelve cutting teeth of a\r\nhorse are close-set and concentrated in the fore-part of its mouth, like\r\nso many adzes or chisels. The grinders or molars are large, and have an\r\nextremely complicated structure, being composed of a number of different\r\nsubstances of unequal hardness. The consequence of this is that they\r\nwear away at different rates; and, hence, the surface of each grinder\r\nis always as uneven as that of a good millstone.\r\n\r\nI have said that the structure of the grinding teeth is very\r\ncomplicated, the harder and the softer parts being, as it were,\r\ninterlaced with one another. The result of this is that, as the tooth\r\nwears, the crown presents a peculiar pattern, the nature of which is not\r\nvery easily deciphered at first, but which it is important we should\r\nunderstand clearly. Each grinding tooth of the upper jaw has an _outer\r\nwall_ so shaped that, on the worn crown, it exhibits the form of two\r\ncrescents, one in front and one behind, with their concave sides turned\r\noutwards. From the inner side of the front crescent, a crescentic _front\r\nridge_ passes inwards and backwards, and its inner face enlarges into a\r\nstrong longitudinal fold or _pillar_. From the front part of the hinder\r\ncrescent, a _back ridge_ takes a like direction, and also has its\r\n_pillar_.\r\n\r\nThe deep interspaces or _valleys_ between these ridges and the outer\r\nwall are filled by bony substance, which is called _cement_, and coats\r\nthe whole tooth.\r\n\r\nThe pattern of the worn face of each grinding tooth of the lower jaw is\r\nquite different. It appears to be formed of two crescent-shaped ridges,\r\nthe convexities of which are turned outwards. The free extremity of each\r\ncrescent has a _pillar_, and there is a large double _pillar_ where the\r\ntwo crescents meet. The whole structure is, as it were, imbedded in\r\ncement, which fills up the valleys, as in the upper grinders.\r\n\r\nIf the grinding faces of an upper and of a lower molar of the same side\r\nare applied together, it will be seen that the opposed ridges are\r\nnowhere parallel, but that they frequently cross; and that thus, in the\r\nact of mastication, a hard surface in the one is constantly applied to a\r\nsoft surface in the other, and _vice versa_. They thus constitute a\r\ngrinding apparatus of great efficiency, and one which is repaired as\r\nfast as it wears, owing to the long-continued growth of the teeth.\r\n\r\nSome other peculiarities of the dentition of the horse must be noticed,\r\nas they bear upon what I shall have to say by and by. Thus the crowns of\r\nthe cutting teeth have a peculiar deep pit, which gives rise to the\r\nwell-known \"mark\" of the horse. There is a large space between the outer\r\nincisors and the front grinders. In this space the adult male horse\r\npresents, near the incisors on each side, above and below, a canine or\r\n\"tush,\" which is commonly absent in mares. In a young horse, moreover,\r\nthere is not unfrequently to be seen, in front of the first grinder, a\r\nvery small tooth, which soon falls out. If this small tooth be counted\r\nas one, it will be found that there are seven teeth behind the canine on\r\neach side; namely, the small tooth in question, and the six great\r\ngrinders, among which, by an unusual peculiarity, the foremost tooth is\r\nrather larger than those which follow it.\r\n\r\nI have now enumerated those characteristic structures of the horse which\r\nare of most importance for the purpose we have in view.\r\n\r\nTo any one who is acquainted with the morphology [comparative forms] of\r\nvertebrated animals, they show that the horse deviates widely from the\r\ngeneral structure of mammals; and that the horse type is, in many\r\nrespects, an extreme modification of the general mammalian plan. The\r\nleast modified mammals, in fact, have the radius and ulna, the tibia and\r\nfibula, distinct and separate. They have five distinct and complete\r\ndigits on each foot, and no one of these digits is very much larger than\r\nthe rest. Moreover, in the least modified mammals the total number of\r\nthe teeth is very generally forty-four, while in horses the usual number\r\nis forty, and in the absence of the canines it may be reduced to\r\nthirty-six; the incisor teeth are devoid of the fold seen in those of\r\nthe horse: the grinders regularly diminish in size from the middle of\r\nthe series to its front end; while their crowns are short, early attain\r\ntheir full length, and exhibit simple ridges or tubercles, in place of\r\nthe complex foldings of the horse's grinders.\r\n\r\nHence the general principles of the hypothesis of evolution lead to the\r\nconclusion that the horse must have been derived from some quadruped\r\nwhich possessed five complete digits on each foot; which had the bones\r\nof the fore-arm and of the leg complete and separate; and which\r\npossessed forty-four teeth, among which the crowns of the incisors and\r\ngrinders had a simple structure; while the latter gradually increased in\r\nsize from before backwards, at any rate in the anterior part of the\r\nseries, and had short crowns.\r\n\r\nAnd if the horse has been thus evolved, and the remains of the different\r\nstages of its evolution have been preserved, they ought to present us\r\nwith a series of forms in which the number of the digits becomes\r\nreduced; the bones of the fore-arm and leg gradually take on the equine\r\ncondition; and the form and arrangement of the teeth successively\r\napproximate to those which obtain in existing horses.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to the facts, and see how far they fulfil these requirements\r\nof the doctrine of evolution.\r\n\r\nIn Europe abundant remains of horses are found in the Quaternary and\r\nlater Tertiary strata as far as the Pliocene formation. But these\r\nhorses, which are so common in the cave-deposits and in the gravels of\r\nEurope, are in all essential respects like existing horses. And that is\r\ntrue of all the horses of the latter part of the Pliocene epoch. But in\r\ndeposits which belong to the earlier Pliocene and later Miocene epochs,\r\nand which occur in Britain, in France, in Germany, in Greece, in India,\r\nwe find animals which are extremely like horses--which, in fact, are so\r\nsimilar to horses that you may follow descriptions given in works upon\r\nthe anatomy of the horse upon the skeletons of these animals--but which\r\ndiffer in some important particulars. For example, the structure of\r\ntheir fore and hind limbs is somewhat different. The bones which, in the\r\nhorse, are represented by two splints, imperfect below, are as long as\r\nthe middle metacarpal and metatarsal bones; and attached to the\r\nextremity of each is a digit with three joints of the same general\r\ncharacter as those of the middle digit, only very much smaller. These\r\nsmall digits are so disposed that they could have had but very little\r\nfunctional importance, and they must have been rather of the nature of\r\nthe dew-claws, such as are to be found in many ruminant animals. The\r\n_Hipparion_, as the extinct European three-toed horse is called, in\r\nfact, presents a foot similar to that of the American _Protohippus_\r\n(Fig. 9), except that in the _Hipparion_ the smaller digits are situated\r\nfarther back and are of smaller proportional size than in the\r\n_Protohippus_.\r\n\r\nThe ulna is slightly more distinct than in the horse; and the whole\r\nlength of it, as a very slender shaft intimately united with the radius,\r\nis completely traceable. The fibula appears to be in the same condition\r\nas in the horse. The teeth of the _Hipparion_ are essentially similar to\r\nthose of the horse, but the pattern of the grinders is in some respects\r\na little more complex, and there is a depression on the face of the\r\nskull in front of the orbit, which is not seen in existing horses.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier Miocene, and perhaps the later Eocene deposits of some\r\nparts of Europe, another extinct animal has been discovered, which\r\nCuvier, who first described some fragments of it, considered to be a\r\n_Palæotherium_. But as further discoveries threw new light on its\r\nstructure, it was recognized as a distinct genus under the name of\r\n_Anchitherium_.\r\n\r\nIn its general characters, the skeleton of _Anchitherium_ is very\r\nsimilar to that of the horse. In fact, Lartet and De Blainville called\r\nit _Palæotherium equinum_ or _hippoides_; and De Christol, in 1847, said\r\nthat it differed from _Hipparion_ in little more than the characters of\r\nits teeth, and gave it the name of _Hipparitherium_. Each foot possesses\r\nthree complete toes; while the lateral toes are much larger in\r\nproportion to the middle toe than in _Hipparion_, and doubtless rested\r\non the ground in ordinary locomotion.\r\n\r\nThe ulna is complete and quite distinct from that radius, though firmly\r\nunited with the latter. The fibula seems also to have been complete. Its\r\nlower end, though intimately united with that of the tibia, is clearly\r\nmarked off from the latter bone.\r\n\r\nThere are forty-four teeth. The incisors have no strong pit. The canines\r\nseem to have been well developed in both sexes. The first of the seven\r\ngrinders, which, as I have said, is frequently absent, and when it does\r\nexist, is small in the horse, is a good-sized and permanent tooth,\r\nwhile the grinder which follows it is but little larger than the hinder\r\nones. The crowns of the grinders are short, and though the fundamental\r\npattern of the horse-tooth is discernible, the front and back ridges are\r\nless curved, the accessory pillars, are wanting, and the valleys, much\r\nshallower, are not filled up with cement.\r\n\r\nSeven years ago, when I happened to be looking critically into the\r\nbearing of palæontological facts upon the doctrine of evolution, it\r\nappeared to me that the _Anchitherium_, the _Hipparion_, and the modern\r\nhorses, constitute a series in which the modifications of structure\r\ncoincide with the order of chronological occurrence, in the manner in\r\nwhich they must coincide, if the modern horses really are the result of\r\nthe gradual metamorphosis, in the course of the Tertiary epoch, of a\r\nless specialized ancestral form. And I found by correspondence with the\r\nlate eminent French anatomist and palæontologist, M. Lartet, that he had\r\narrived at the same conclusion from the same data.\r\n\r\nThat the _Anchitherium_ type had become metamorphosed into the\r\n_Hipparion_ type, and the latter into the _Equine_ type,[5] in the\r\ncourse of that period of time which is represented by the latter half\r\nof the Tertiary deposits, seemed to me to be the only explanation of the\r\nfacts for which there was even a shadow of probability.\r\n\r\nAnd, hence, I have ever since held that these facts afford evidence of\r\nthe occurrence of evolution, which, in the sense already defined, may be\r\ntermed demonstrative.\r\n\r\nAll who have occupied themselves with the structure of _Anchitherium_,\r\nfrom Cuvier onwards, have acknowledged its many points of likeness to a\r\nwell-known genus of extinct Eocene mammals, _Palæotherium_. Indeed, as\r\nwe have seen, Cuvier regarded his remains of _Anchitherium_ as those of\r\na species of _Palæotherium_. Hence, in attempting to trace the pedigree\r\nof the horse beyond the Miocene epoch and the Anchitheroid form, I\r\nnaturally sought among the various species of Palæotheroid animals for\r\nits nearest ally, and I was led to the conclusion that the _Palæotherium\r\nminus_ (_Plagiolophus_) represented the next step more nearly than any\r\nform then known.\r\n\r\nI think that this opinion was fully justifiable; but the progress of\r\ninvestigation has thrown an unexpected light on the question, and has\r\nbrought us much nearer than could have been anticipated to a knowledge\r\nof the true series of the progenitors of the horse.\r\n\r\nYou are all aware that, when your country was first discovered by\r\nEuropeans, there were no traces of the existence of the horse on any\r\npart of the American Continent. The accounts of the conquest of Mexico\r\ndwell upon the astonishment of the natives of that country when they\r\nfirst became acquainted with that astounding phenomenon--a man seated\r\nupon a horse. Nevertheless, the investigations of American geologists\r\nhave proved that the remains of horses occur in the most superficial\r\ndeposits of both North and South America, just as they do in Europe.\r\nTherefore, for some reason or other--no feasible suggestion on that\r\nsubject, so far as I know, has been made--the horse must have died out\r\non this continent at some period preceding the discovery of America. Of\r\nlate years there has been discovered in your Western Territories that\r\nmarvellous accumulation of deposits, admirably adapted for the\r\npreservation of organic remains, to which I referred the other evening,\r\nand which furnishes us with a consecutive series of records of the fauna\r\nof the older half of the Tertiary epoch, for which we have no parallel\r\nin Europe. They have yielded fossils in an excellent state of\r\nconservation and in unexampled numbers and variety. The researches of\r\nLeidy and others have shown that forms allied to the _Hipparion_ and the\r\n_Anchitherium_ are to be found among these remains. But it is only\r\nrecently that the admirably conceived and most thoroughly and patiently\r\nworked-out investigations of Professor Marsh have given us a just idea\r\nof the vast fossil wealth, and of the scientific importance, of these\r\ndeposits. I have had the advantage of glancing over the collections in\r\nYale Museum; and I can truly say, that so far as my knowledge extends,\r\nthere is no collection from any one region and series of strata\r\ncomparable, for extent, or for the care with which the remains have been\r\ngot together, or for their scientific importance, to the series of\r\nfossils which he has deposited there. This vast collection has yielded\r\nevidence bearing upon the question of the pedigree of the horse of the\r\nmost striking character. It tends to show that we must look to America,\r\nrather than to Europe, for the original seat of the equine series; and\r\nthat the archaic forms and successive modifications of the horse's\r\nancestry are far better preserved here than in Europe.\r\n\r\nProfessor Marsh's kindness has enabled me to put before you a diagram,\r\nevery figure of which is an actual representation of some specimen which\r\nis to be seen at Yale at this present time (Fig. 9).\r\n\r\nThe succession of forms which he has brought together carries us from\r\nthe top to the bottom of the Tertiaries. Firstly, there is the true\r\nhorse. Next we have the American Pliocene form of the horse\r\n(_Pliohippus_); in the conformation of its limbs it presents some very\r\nslight deviations from the ordinary horse, and the crowns of the\r\ngrinding teeth are shorter. Then comes the _Protohippus_, which\r\nrepresents the European _Hipparion_, having one large digit and two\r\nsmall ones on each foot, and the general characters of the fore-arm and\r\nleg to which I have referred. But it is more valuable than the European\r\n_Hipparion_ for the reason that it is devoid of some of the\r\npeculiarities of that form--peculiarities which tend to show that the\r\nEuropean _Hipparion_ is rather a member of a collateral branch, than a\r\nform in the direct line of succession. Next, in the backward order in\r\ntime, is the _Miohippus_, which corresponds pretty nearly with the\r\n_Anchitherium_ of Europe. It presents three complete toes--one large\r\nmedian and two smaller lateral ones; and there is a rudiment of that\r\ndigit, which answers to the little finger of the human hand.\r\n\r\nThe European record of the pedigree of the horse stops here; in the\r\nAmerican Tertiaries, on the contrary, the series of ancestral equine\r\nforms is continued into the Eocene formations. An older Miocene form,\r\ntermed _Mesohippus_, has three toes in front, with a large splint-like\r\nrudiment representing the little finger; and three toes behind. The\r\nradius and ulna, the tibia and the fibula, are distinct, and the short\r\ncrowned molar teeth are anchitheroid in pattern.\r\n\r\nBut the most important discovery of all is the _Orohippus_, which comes\r\nfrom the Eocene formation, and which is the oldest member of the equine\r\nseries, as yet known. Here we find four complete toes on the front-limb,\r\nthree toes on the hind-limb, a well-developed ulna, a well-developed\r\nfibula, and short-crowned grinders of simple pattern.\r\n\r\nThus, thanks to these important researches, it has become evident that,\r\nso far as our present knowledge extends, the history of the horse-type\r\nis exactly and precisely that which could have been predicted from a\r\nknowledge of the principles of evolution. And the knowledge we now\r\npossess justifies us completely in the anticipation, that when the still\r\nlower Eocene deposits, and those which belong to the Cretaceous epoch,\r\nhave yielded up their remains of ancestral equine animals, we shall\r\nfind, first, a form with four complete toes and a rudiment of the\r\ninnermost or first digit in front, with probably, a rudiment of the\r\nfifth digit in the hind foot;[6] while, in still older forms, the series\r\nof the digits will be more and more complete, until we come to the\r\nfive-toed animals, in which, if the doctrine of evolution is well\r\nfounded, the whole series must have taken its origin.\r\n\r\nThat is what I mean by demonstrative evidence of evolution. An inductive\r\nhypothesis is said to be demonstrated when the facts are shown to be in\r\nentire accordance with it. If that is not scientific proof, there are no\r\nmerely inductive conclusions which can be said to be proved. And the\r\ndoctrine of evolution, at the present time, rests upon exactly as secure\r\na foundation as the Copernican theory of the motions of the heavenly\r\nbodies did at the time of its promulgation. Its logical basis is\r\nprecisely of the same character--the coincidence of the observed facts\r\nwith theoretical requirements.\r\n\r\nThe only way of escape, if it be a way of escape, from the conclusions\r\nwhich I have just indicated, is the supposition that all these different\r\nequine forms have been created separately at separate epochs of time;\r\nand, I repeat, that of such an hypothesis as this there neither is, nor\r\ncan be, any scientific evidence; and, assuredly, so far as I know, there\r\nis none which is supported, or pretends to be supported, by evidence or\r\nauthority of any other kind. I can but think that the time will come\r\nwhen such suggestions as these, such obvious attempts to escape the\r\nforce of demonstration, will be put upon the same footing as the\r\nsupposition made by some writers, who are, I believe, not completely\r\nextinct at present, that fossils are mere simulacra [images], are no\r\nindications of the former existence of the animals to which they seem to\r\nbelong; but that they are either sports of Nature, or special creations,\r\nintended--as I heard suggested the other day--to test our faith.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the whole evidence is in favour of evolution, and there is none\r\nagainst it. And I say this, although perfectly well aware of the seeming\r\ndifficulties which have been built up upon what appears to the\r\nuninformed to be a solid foundation. I meet constantly with the argument\r\nthat the doctrine of evolution cannot be well founded because it\r\nrequires the lapse of a very vast period of time; while the duration of\r\nlife upon the earth, thus implied, is inconsistent with the conclusions\r\narrived at by the astronomer and the physicist. I may venture to say\r\nthat I am familiar with those conclusions, inasmuch as some years ago,\r\nwhen president of the Geological Society of London, I took the liberty\r\nof criticising them, and of showing in what respects, as it appeared to\r\nme, they lacked complete and thorough demonstration. But, putting that\r\npoint aside, suppose that, as the astronomers, or some of them, and some\r\nphysical philosophers tell us, it is impossible that life could have\r\nendured upon the earth for so long a period as is required by the\r\ndoctrine of evolution--supposing that to be proved--I desire to be\r\ninformed, what is the foundation for the statement that evolution does\r\nrequire so great a time? The biologist knows nothing whatever of the\r\namount of time which may be required for the process of evolution. It is\r\na matter of fact that the equine forms, which I have described to you,\r\noccur, in the order stated, in the Tertiary formations. But I have not\r\nthe slightest means of guessing whether it took a million of years, or\r\nten millions, or a hundred millions, or a thousand millions of years, to\r\ngive rise to that series of changes. A biologist has no means of\r\narriving at any conclusions as to the amount of time which may be needed\r\nfor a certain quantity of organic change. He takes his time from the\r\ngeologist. The geologist, considering the rate at which deposits are\r\nformed and the rate at which denudation goes on upon the surface of the\r\nearth, arrives at more or less justifiable conclusions as to the time\r\nwhich is required for the deposit of a certain thickness of rocks; and\r\nif he tells me that the Tertiary formations required 500,000,000 years\r\nfor their deposit, I suppose he has good ground for what he says, and I\r\ntake that as a measure of the duration of the evolution of the horse\r\nfrom the _Orohippus_ up to its present condition. And, if he is right,\r\nundoubtedly evolution is a very slow process, and requires a great deal\r\nof time. But suppose now, that an astronomer or a physicist--for\r\ninstance, my friend Sir William Thomson--tells me that my geological\r\nauthority is quite wrong; and that he has weighty evidence to show that\r\nlife could not possibly have existed upon the surface of the earth\r\n500,000,000 years ago, because the earth would have then been too hot to\r\nallow of life, my reply is: \"That is not my affair; settle that with the\r\ngeologist, and when you have come to an agreement among yourselves I\r\nwill adopt your conclusions.\" We take our time from the geologists and\r\nphysicists, and it is monstrous that, having taken our time from the\r\nphysical philosopher's clock, the physical philosopher should turn round\r\nupon us, and say we are too fast or too slow. What we desire to know is,\r\nis it a fact that evolution took place? As to the amount of time which\r\nevolution may have occupied, we are in the hands of the physicist and\r\nthe astronomer, whose business it is to deal with those questions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9]\r\n\r\nFore Foot.

HOWARD\r\n\r\n     [Dr. Howard is Chief of the Division of Entomology in the\r\n     United States Department of Agriculture at Washington. He is\r\n     a lecturer at Swarthmore College and at Georgetown\r\n     University. He has written \"The Insect Book,\" published by\r\n     Doubleday, Page & Co., New York; and a work on Mosquitoes,\r\n     issued by McClure, Phillips & Co., New York. Both are books\r\n     of interest from the hand of a master: they are fully\r\n     illustrated. The narrative which follows appeared in\r\n     _Everybody's Magazine_, June, 1901.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSome twenty-five years ago there appeared suddenly upon certain acacia\r\ntrees at Menlo Park, California, a very destructive scale bug. It\r\nrapidly increased and spread from tree to tree, attacking apples, figs,\r\npomegranates, quinces, and roses, and many other trees and plants, but\r\nseeming to prefer to all other food the beautiful orange and lemon trees\r\nwhich grow so luxuriantly on the Pacific Coast, and from which a large\r\nshare of the income of so many fruit-growers is gained. This insect,\r\nwhich came to be known as the _white scale_ or _fluted scale_ or the\r\n_Icerya_ (from its scientific name), was an insignificant creature in\r\nitself, resembling a small bit of fluted wax a little more than a\r\nquarter of an inch long. But when the scales had once taken possession\r\nof a tree, they swarmed over it until the bark was hidden; they sucked\r\nits sap through their minute beaks until the plant became so feeble that\r\nthe leaves and young fruit dropped off, a hideous black smut-fungus\r\ncrept over the young twigs, and the weakened tree gradually died.\r\n\r\nIn this way orchard after orchard of oranges, worth a thousand dollars\r\nor more an acre, was utterly destroyed; the best fruit-growing sections\r\nof the State were invaded, and ruin stared many a fruit-grower in the\r\nface. This spread of the pest was gradual, extending through a series of\r\nyears, and not until 1886 did it become so serious a matter as to\r\nattract national attention.\r\n\r\nIn this year an investigation was begun by the late Professor C. V.\r\nRiley, the Government entomologist then connected with the Department of\r\nAgriculture at Washington. He sent two agents to California, both of\r\nwhom immediately began to study the problem of remedies. In 1887 he\r\nvisited California himself, and during that year published an elaborate\r\nreport giving the results of the work up to that point. The complete\r\nlife-history of the insect had been worked out, and a number of washes\r\nhad been discovered which could be applied to the trees in the form of a\r\nspray, and which would kill a large proportion of the pests at a\r\ncomparatively small expense. But it was soon found that the average\r\nfruit-grower would not take the trouble to spray his trees, largely from\r\nthe fact that he had experimented for some years with inferior washes\r\nand quack nostrums, and from lack of success had become disgusted with\r\nthe whole idea of using liquid compounds. Something easier, something\r\nmore radical was necessary in his disheartened condition.\r\n\r\nMeantime, after much sifting of evidence and much correspondence with\r\nnaturalists in many parts of the world, Professor Riley had decided that\r\nthe white scale was a native of Australia, and had been first brought\r\nover to California accidentally upon Australian plants. In the same way\r\nit was found to have reached South Africa and New Zealand, in both of\r\nwhich colonies it had greatly increased, and had become just such a pest\r\nas it is in California. In Australia, however, its native home, it did\r\nnot seem to be abundant, and was not known as a pest--a somewhat\r\nsurprising state of affairs, which put the entomologist on the track of\r\nthe results which proved of such great value to California. He reasoned\r\nthat, in his native home, with the same food plants upon which it\r\nflourished abroad in such great abundance, it would undoubtedly do the\r\nsame damage that it does in South Africa, New Zealand, and California,\r\nif there were not in Australia some natural enemy, probable some insect\r\nparasite or predatory beetle, which killed it off. It became therefore\r\nimportant to send a trained man to Australia to investigate this\r\npromising line.\r\n\r\nAfter many difficulties in arranging preliminaries relating to the\r\npayment of expenses (in which finally the Department of State kindly\r\nassisted), one of Professor Riley's assistants, a young German named\r\nAlbert Koebele, who had been with him for a number of years, sailed for\r\nAustralia in August, 1888. Koebele was a skilled collector and an\r\nadmirable man for the purpose. He at once found that Professor Riley's\r\nsupposition was correct: there existed in Australia small flies which\r\nlaid their eggs in the white scales, and these eggs hatched into grubs\r\nwhich devoured the pests. He also found a remarkable little ladybird, a\r\nsmall, reddish-brown convex beetle, which breeds with marvellous\r\nrapidity and which, with voracious appetite, and at the same time with\r\ndiscriminating taste, devours scale after scale, but eats fluted scales\r\nonly--does not attack other insects. This beneficial creature, now known\r\nas the Australian ladybird, or the Vedalia, Mr. Koebele at once began to\r\ncollect in large numbers, together with several other insects found\r\ndoing the same work. He packed many hundreds of living specimens of the\r\nladybird, with plenty of food, in tin boxes, and had them placed on ice\r\nin the ice-box of the steamer at Sydney; they were carried carefully to\r\nCalifornia, where they were liberated upon orange trees at Los Angeles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vedalia, or Australian Ladybird]\r\n\r\nThese sendings were repeated for several months, and Mr. Koebele, on his\r\nreturn in April, 1889, brought with him many more living specimens which\r\nhe had collected on his way home in New Zealand, where the same Vedalia\r\nhad been accidentally introduced a year or so before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Larvæ of Vedalia eating White Scale]\r\n\r\nThe result more than justified the most sanguine expectations. The\r\nladybirds reached Los Angeles alive, and, with appetites sharpened by\r\ntheir long ocean voyage, immediately fell upon the devoted scales and\r\ndevoured them one after another almost without rest. Their hunger\r\ntemporarily satisfied, they began to lay eggs. These eggs hatched in a\r\nfew days into active grub-like creatures--the larvæ of the beetles--and\r\nthese grubs proved as voracious as their parents. They devoured the\r\nscales right and left, and in less than a month transformed once more to\r\nbeetles.\r\n\r\nAnd so the work of extermination went on. Each female beetle laid on an\r\naverage 300 eggs, and each of these eggs hatched into a hungry larva.\r\nSupposing that one-half of these larvæ produced female beetles, a simple\r\ncalculation will show that in six months a single ladybird became the\r\nancestor of 75,000,000,000 of other ladybirds, each capable of\r\ndestroying very many scale insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Twig of olive infected with Black Scale]\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder, then, that the fluted scales soon began to disappear?\r\nIs it any wonder that orchard after orchard was entirely freed from the\r\npest, until now over a large section of the State hardly an Icerya is to\r\nbe found? And could a more striking illustration of the value of the\r\nstudy of insects possibly be instanced? In less than a year from the\r\ntime when the first of these hungry Australians was liberated from his\r\nbox in Los Angeles the orange trees were once more in bloom and were\r\nresuming their old-time verdure--the Icerya had become practically a\r\nthing of the past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rhizobius, the imported enemy of the Black Scale of the\r\nOlive.]\r\n\r\nThis wonderful success encouraged other efforts in the same direction.\r\nThe State of California some years later sent the same entomologist,\r\nKoebele, to Australia to search for some insect enemy of the black\r\nscale, an insect which threatened the destruction of the extensive olive\r\norchards of California. He found and successfully introduced another\r\nladybird beetle, known as _Rhizobius ventralis_, a little dark-coloured\r\ncreature which has thrived in the California climate, especially near\r\nthe seacoast, and in the damp air of those regions has successfully held\r\nthe black scale in check. It was found, however, that back from the\r\nseacoast this insect did not seem to thrive with the same vigor, and the\r\nblack scale held its own. Then a spirited controversy sprung up among\r\nthe olive-growers, those near the seacoast contending that the\r\n_Rhizobius_ was a perfect remedy for the scale, while those inland\r\ninsisted that it was worthless. A few years later it was discovered that\r\nthis olive enemy in South Europe is killed by a little caterpillar,\r\nwhich burrows through scale after scale eating out their contents, and\r\nan effort was made to introduce the caterpillar into California, but\r\nthese efforts failed. Within the past two years it has been found that a\r\nsmall parasitic fly exists in South Africa which lays its eggs in the\r\nsame black scale, and its grub-like larvæ eat out the bodies of the\r\nscales and destroy them. The climate of the region in which this\r\nparasite exists is dry through a large part of the year, and therefore\r\nthis little parasitic fly, known as _Scutellista_, was thought to be\r\nthe needed insect for the dry California regions. With the help of Mr.\r\nC. P. Lounsbury, the Government entomologist of Cape Colony, living\r\nspecimens of this fly were brought to this country, and were colonized\r\nin the Santa Clara Valley, near San José, California, where they have\r\nperpetuated themselves and destroyed many of the black scales, and\r\npromise to be most successful in their warfare against the injurious\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nThis same _Scutellista_ parasite had, curiously enough, been previously\r\nintroduced in an accidental manner into Italy, probably from India, and\r\nprobably in scale-insects living on ornamental plants brought from\r\nIndia. But in Italy it lives commonly in another scale insect, and with\r\nthe assistance of the learned Italian, Professor Antonio Berlese, the\r\nwriter made an unsuccessful attempt to introduce and establish it a year\r\nearlier in some of our Southern States, where it was hoped it would\r\ndestroy certain injurious insects known as \"wax scales.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the United States, not content with keeping all the good\r\nthings to herself, has spread the first ladybird imported--the\r\n_Vedalia_--to other countries. Four years ago the white scale was\r\npresent in enormous numbers in orange groves on the left bank of the\r\nriver Tagus, in Portugal, and threatened to wipe out the orange-growing\r\nindustry in that country. The California people, in pursuance of a\r\nfar-sighted policy, had with great difficulty, owing to lack of food,\r\nkept alive some colonies of the beneficial beetle, and specimens were\r\nsent to Portugal which reached there alive and flourishing. They were\r\ntended for a short time, and then liberated in the orange groves, with\r\nprecisely the same result as in California. In a few months the scale\r\ninsects were almost entirely destroyed, and the Portuguese\r\norange-growers saved from enormous loss.\r\n\r\nThis good result in Portugal was not accomplished without opposition. It\r\nwas tried experimentally at the advice of the writer, and in the face of\r\ngreat incredulity on the part of certain Portuguese newspapers and of\r\nsome officials. By many prominent persons the account published of the\r\nwork of the insect in the United States was considered as untrustworthy,\r\nand simply another instance of American boasting. But the opposition was\r\noverruled, and the triumphant result silenced all opposition. It is safe\r\nto say that the general opinion among Portuguese orange-growers to-day\r\nis very favourable to American enterprise and practical scientific\r\nacumen.\r\n\r\nThe _Vedalia_ was earlier sent to the people in Alexandria and Cairo,\r\nEgypt, where a similar scale was damaging the fig trees and other\r\nvaluable plants, and the result was again the same, the injurious\r\ninsects were destroyed. This was achieved only after extensive\r\ncorrespondence and several failures. The active agent in Alexandria was\r\nRear Admiral Blomfield, of the British Royal Navy, a man apparently of\r\nwide information, good judgment, and great energy.\r\n\r\nThe same thing occurred when the California people sent this saviour of\r\nhorticulture to South Africa, where the white scale had also made its\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nIt is not only beneficial insects, however, which are being imported,\r\nbut diseases of injurious insects. In South Africa the colonists suffer\r\nseverely from swarms of migratory grasshoppers, which fly from the north\r\nand destroy their crops. They have discovered out there a fungus\r\ndisease, which under favorable conditions kills off the grasshoppers in\r\nenormous numbers. At the Bacteriological Institute in Grahamstown,\r\nNatal, they have cultivated this fungus in culture tubes, and have\r\ncarried it successfully throughout the whole year; and they have used it\r\npractically by distributing these culture tubes wherever swarms of\r\ngrasshoppers settle and lay their eggs. The disease, once started in an\r\narmy of young grasshoppers, soon reduces them to harmless numbers. The\r\nUnited States Government last year secured culture tubes of this\r\ndisease, and experiments carried on in Colorado and in Mississippi show\r\nthat the vitality of the fungus had not been destroyed by its long ocean\r\nvoyage, and many grasshoppers were killed by its spread. During the past\r\nwinter other cultures were brought over from Cape Colony, and the fungus\r\nis being propagated in the Department of Agriculture for distribution\r\nduring the coming summer in parts of the country where grasshoppers may\r\nprove to be destructively abundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grasshopper dying from Fungus Disease]\r\n\r\nAlthough we practically no longer have those tremendous swarms of\r\nmigratory grasshoppers which used to come down like devastating armies\r\nin certain of our Western States and in a night devour everything green,\r\nstill, almost every year, and especially in the West and South, there\r\nis somewhere a multiplication of grasshoppers to a very injurious\r\ndegree, and it is hoped that the introduced fungus can be used in such\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nPersons officially engaged in searching for remedies for injurious\r\ninsects all over the world have banded themselves together in a society\r\nknown as the Association of Economic Entomologists. They are constantly\r\ninterchanging ideas regarding the destruction of insects, and at present\r\nactive movements are on foot in this direction of interchanging\r\nbeneficial insects. Entomologists in Europe will try the coming summer\r\nto send to the United States living specimens of a tree-inhabiting\r\nbeetle which eats the caterpillar of the gipsy moth, and which will\r\nundoubtedly also eat the caterpillar so common upon the shade-trees of\r\nour principal Eastern cities, which is known as the Tussock moth\r\ncaterpillar. An entomologist from the United States, Mr. C. L. Marlatt,\r\nhas started for Japan, China, and Java, for the purpose of trying to\r\nfind the original home of the famous San José scale--an insect which has\r\nbeen doing enormous damage in the apple, pear, peach, and plum orchards\r\nof the United States--and if he finds the original home of this scale,\r\nit is hoped that some natural enemy or parasite will be discovered which\r\ncan be introduced into the United States to the advantage of our\r\nfruit-growers. Professor Berlese of Italy, and Dr. Reh, of Germany,\r\nwill attempt the introduction into Europe of some of the parasites of\r\ninjurious insects which occur in the United States, and particularly\r\nthose of the woolly root-louse of the apple, known in Europe as the\r\n\"American blight\"--one of the few injurious insects which probably went\r\nto Europe from this country, and which in the United States is not so\r\ninjurious as it is in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, by the way, that while we have had most of our\r\nvery injurious insects from Europe, American insects, when accidentally\r\nintroduced into Europe, do not seem to thrive. The insect just\r\nmentioned, and the famous grape-vine _Phylloxera_, a creature which\r\ncaused France a greater economic loss than the enormous indemnity which\r\nshe had to pay to Germany after the Franco-Prussian War, are practically\r\nthe only American insects with which we have been able to repay Europe\r\nfor the insects which she has sent us. Climatic differences, no doubt,\r\naccount for this strange fact, and our longer and warmer summers are the\r\nprincipal factor.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone the parasitic and predaceous insects which are\r\nbeneficial. A new industry has been brought into the United States\r\nduring the past two years by the introduction and acclimatization of the\r\nlittle insect which fertilizes the Smyrna fig in Mediterranean\r\ncountries. The dried-fig industry in this country has never amounted to\r\nanything. The Smyrna fig has controlled the dried-fig markets of the\r\nworld, but in California the Smyrna fig has never held its fruit, the\r\nyoung figs dropping from the trees without ripening. It was found that\r\nin Mediterranean regions a little insect, known as the _Blastophaga_,\r\nfertilizes the flowers of the Smyrna fig with pollen from the wild fig\r\nwhich it inhabits. The United States Department of Agriculture in the\r\nspring of 1899 imported successfully some of these insects through one\r\nof its travelling agents, Mr. W. T. Swingle, and the insect was\r\nsuccessfully established at Fresno in the San Joaquin Valley. A\r\nfar-sighted fruit-grower, Mr. George C. Roeding, of Fresno, had planted\r\nsome years previously an orchard of 5,000 Smyrna fig trees and wild fig\r\ntrees, and his place was the one chosen for the successful experiment.\r\nThe little insect multiplied with astonishing rapidity, was carried\r\nsuccessfully through the winter of 1899-1900, and in the summer of 1900\r\nwas present in such great numbers that it fertilized thousands of figs,\r\nand fifteen tons of them ripened. When these figs were dried and packed\r\nit was discovered that they were superior to the best imported figs.\r\nThey contained more sugar and were of a finer flavor than those brought\r\nfrom Smyrna and Algeria. The _Blastophaga_ has come to stay, and the\r\nprospects for a new and important industry are assured.\r\n\r\nWith all these experiments the criticism is constantly made that\r\nunwittingly new and serious enemies to agriculture may be introduced.\r\nThe unfortunate introduction of the English sparrow into this country is\r\nmentioned, and the equally unfortunate introduction of the East Indian\r\nmongoose into the West Indies as well. The fear is expressed that the\r\nbeneficial parasitic insects, after they have destroyed the injurious\r\ninsects, will either themselves attack valuable crops or do something\r\nelse of an equally harmful nature. But there is no reason for such\r\nalarm. The English sparrow feeds on all sorts of things, and the East\r\nIndian mongoose, while it was introduced into Jamaica to kill snakes,\r\nwas found, too late, to be also a very general feeder. As a matter of\r\nfact, after the snakes were destroyed, and even before, it attacked\r\nyoung pigs, kids, lambs, calves, puppies, and kittens, and also\r\ndestroyed bananas, pineapples, corn, sweet potatoes, cocoanuts, peas,\r\nsugar corn, meat, and salt provisions and fish. But with the parasitic\r\nand predatory insects the food habits are definite and fixed. They can\r\nlive on nothing but their natural food, and in its absence they die. The\r\nAustralian ladybird originally imported, for example, will feed upon\r\nnothing but scale insects of a particular genus, and, as a matter of\r\nfact, as soon as the fluted scales became scarce the California\r\nofficials had the greatest difficulty in keeping the little beetles\r\nalive, and were actually obliged to cultivate for food the very insects\r\nwhich they were formerly so anxious to wipe out of existence! With the\r\n_Scutellista_ parasite the same fact holds. The fly itself does not\r\nfeed, and its young feed only upon certain scale insects, and so with\r\nall the rest.\r\n\r\nAll of these experiments are being carried on by men learned in the ways\r\nof insects, and only beneficial results, or at the very least negative\r\nones, can follow. And even where only one such experiment out of a\r\nhundred is successful, what a saving it will mean!\r\n\r\nWe do not expect the time to come when the farmer, finding Hessian fly\r\nin his wheat, will have only to telegraph the nearest experiment\r\nstation, \"Send at once two dozen first-class parasites;\" but in many\r\ncases, and with a number of different kinds of injurious insects,\r\nespecially those introduced from foreign countries, it is probable that\r\nwe can gain much relief by the introduction of their natural enemies\r\nfrom their original home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE STORY OF THE FLOWERS\r\n\r\nGEORGE ILES\r\n\r\n     [From \"The Wild Flowers of America,\" copyright by G.

The American\r\n     edition is out of print: the Canadian edition, \"Wild Flowers\r\n     of Canada,\" is published by Graham & Co., Montreal, Canada.\r\n     The work describes and illustrates in their natural tints\r\n     nearly three hundred beautiful flowers.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImagine a Venetian doge, a French crusader, a courtier of the time of\r\nthe second Charles, an Ojibway chief, a Justice of the Supreme Court, in\r\nthe formal black of evening dress, and how much each of them would lose!\r\nWhere there is beauty, strength or dignity, dress can heighten it; where\r\nall these are lacking, their absence is kept out of mind by raiment in\r\nitself worthy to be admired. If dress artificial has told for much in\r\nthe history of human-kind, dress natural has told for yet more in the\r\nlesser world of plant and insect life. In some degree the tiny folk that\r\nreign in the air, like ourselves, are drawn by grace of form, by charm\r\nof colour; of elaborate display of their attractions moths, butterflies\r\nand beetles are just as fond as any belles of the ball-room. Now let us\r\nbear in mind that of all the creatures that share the earth with man,\r\nthe one that stands next to him in intelligence is neither a biped nor\r\na quadruped, but that king of the insect tribe, the ant, which can be a\r\nherdsman and warehouse-keeper, an engineer and builder, an explorer and\r\na general. With all his varied powers the ant lacks a peculiarity in his\r\ncostume which has denied him enlistment in a task of revolution in which\r\ncreatures far his inferiors have been able to change the face of the\r\nearth. And the marvel of this peculiarity of garb which has meant so\r\nmuch, is that it consists in no detail of graceful outline, or beauty of\r\ntint, but solely in the minor matter of texture. The ant, warrior that\r\nhe is, wears smooth and shining armour; the bee, the moth and the\r\nbutterfly are clad in downy vesture, and simply because thus enabled to\r\ncatch dust on their clothes these insects, as weavers of the web of\r\nlife, have counted for immensely more than the ant with all his brains\r\nand character. To understand the mighty train of consequences set in\r\nmotion by this mere shagginess of coat, let us remember that, like a\r\nhuman babe, every flowering plant has two parents. These two parents,\r\nthough a county's breadth divide them, are wedded the instant that\r\npollen from the anther of one of them meets the stigma of the other.\r\nMany flowers find their mates upon their own stem; but, as in the races\r\nof animals, too close intermarriage is hurtful, and union with a distant\r\nstock promotes both health and vigor. Hence the great gain which has\r\ncome to plants by engaging the wind as their matchmaker--as every\r\nsummer shows us in its pollen-laden air, the oaks, the pines, the\r\ncottonwoods, and a host of other plants commit to the breeze the winged\r\natoms charged with the continuance of their kind. Nevertheless, long as\r\nthe wind has been employed at this work, it has not yet learned to do it\r\nwell; nearly all the pollen entrusted to it is wasted, and this while\r\nits production draws severely upon the strength of a plant. As good\r\nfortune will have it, a great many flowers close to their pollen yield\r\nan ample supply of nectar: a food esteemed delicious by the whole round\r\nof insects, winged and wingless. While ants might sip this nectar of\r\nages without plants being any the better or the worse; a very different\r\nresult has followed upon the visits of bees, wasps, and other\r\nhairy-coated callers. These, as they devour nectar, dust themselves with\r\nthe pollen near by. Yellowed or whitened with this freightage, moth and\r\nbutterfly, as they sail through the air, know not that they are\r\npublishing the banns of marriage between two blossoms acres or, it may\r\nbe, miles apart. Yet so it is. Alighting on a new flower the insect rubs\r\na pollen grain on a stigma ready to receive it, and lo! the rites of\r\nmatrimony are solemnized then and there. Unwittingly the little visitor\r\nhas wrought a task bigger with fate than many an act loudly trumpeted\r\namong the mightiest deeds of men! On the threshold of a Lady's Slipper a\r\nbee may often be detected in the act of entrance. In the Sage-flower he\r\nfinds an anther of the stamen which, pivoted on its spring, dusts him\r\neven more effectually.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sage-flower and Bee]\r\n\r\nBountifully to spread a table is much, but not enough, for without\r\ninvitation how can hospitality be dispensed? To the feast of nectar the\r\nblossoms join their bidding; and those most conspicuously borne and\r\nmassed, gayest of hue, richest in odor, secure most guests, and are\r\ntherefore most likely to transmit to their kind their own excellences as\r\nhosts and entertainers. Thus all the glories of the blossoms have arisen\r\nin doing useful work; their beauty is not mere ornament, but the sign\r\nand token of duty well performed. Our opportunity to admire the radiancy\r\nand perfume of a jessamine or a pond-lily is due to the previous\r\nadmiration of uncounted winged attendants. If a winsome maid adorns\r\nherself with a wreath from the garden, and carries a posy gathered at\r\nthe brookside, it is for the second time that their charms are impressed\r\ninto service; for the flowers' own ends of attraction all their scent\r\nand loveliness were called into being long before.\r\n\r\nLet us put flowers of the blue flag beside those of the maple, and we\r\nshall have a fair contrast between the brilliancy of blossoms whose\r\nmarrier has been an insect, and the dinginess of flowers indebted to the\r\nservices of the wind. Can it be that both kinds of flowers are descended\r\nfrom forms resembling each other in want of grace and colour? Such,\r\nindeed, is the truth. But how, as the generations of the flowers\r\nsucceeded one another, did differences so striking come about? In our\r\nrambles afield let us seek a clue to the mystery. It is late in\r\nspringtime, and near the border of a bit of swamp we notice a clump of\r\nviolets: they are pale of hue, and every stalk of them rises to an\r\nalmost weedy height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wild Rose, Single]\r\n\r\nTwenty paces away, on a knoll of dry ground, we find more violets, but\r\nthese are in much deeper tints of azure and yellow, while their stalks\r\nare scarcely more than half as tall as their brethren near the swamp.\r\nSix weeks pass by. This time we walk to a wood-lot close to a brimming\r\npond. At its edge are more than a score wild-rose bushes. On the very\r\nfirst of them we see that some of the blossoms are a light pink, others\r\na pink so deep as to seem dashed with vivid red. And while a flower here\r\nand there is decidedly larger and more vigorous than its fellows, a few\r\nof the blossoms are undersized and puny: the tide of life flows high and\r\nmerrily in a fortunate rose or two, it seems to ebb and falter by the\r\ntime it reaches one or two of their unhappy mates. As we search bush\r\nafter bush we are at last repaid for sundry scratches from their thorns\r\nby securing a double rose, a \"sport,\" as the gardener would call it. And\r\nin the broad meadow between us and home we well know that for the quest\r\nwe can have not only four-leaved clovers, but perchance a handful of\r\nfive and six-leaved prizes. The secret is out. Flowers and leaves are\r\nnot cast like bullets in rigid moulds, but differ from their parents\r\nmuch as children do. Usually the difference is slight, at times it is as\r\nmarked as in our double rose. Whenever the change in a flower is for the\r\nworse, as in the sickly violets and roses we have observed, that\r\nparticular change ends there--with death. But when the change makes a\r\nhealthy flower a little more attractive to its insect ministers, it will\r\nnaturally be chosen by them for service, and these choosings, kept up\r\nyear after year, and century upon century, have at last accomplished\r\nmuch the same result as if the moth, the bee, and the rest of them had\r\nbeen given power to create blossoms of the most welcome forms, the most\r\nalluring tints, the most bewitching perfumes.\r\n\r\nIn farther jaunts afield we shall discover yet more. It is May, and a\r\nheavy rainstorm has caused the petals of a trillium to forget\r\nthemselves and return to their primitive hue of leafy green. A month\r\nlater we come upon a buttercup, one of whose sepals has grown out as a\r\nsmall but perfect leaf. Later still in summer we find a rose in the same\r\nsurprising case, while not far off is a columbine bearing pollen on its\r\nspurs instead of its anthers. What family tie is betrayed in all this?\r\nNo other than that sepals, petals, anthers and pistils are but leaves in\r\ndisguise, and that we have detected nature returning to the form from\r\nwhich ages ago she began to transmute the parts of flowers in all their\r\nteeming diversity. The leaf is the parent not only of all these but of\r\ndelicate tendrils, which save a vine the cost of building a stem stout\r\nenough to lift it to open air and sunshine. However thoroughly, or\r\nhowever long, a habit may be impressed upon a part of a plant, it may on\r\noccasion relapse into a habit older still, resume a shape all but\r\nforgotten, and thus tell a story of its past that otherwise might remain\r\nforever unsuspected. Thus it is with the somewhat rare \"sport\" that\r\ngives us a morning glory or a harebell in its primitive form of unjoined\r\npetals. The bell form of these and similar flowers has established\r\nitself by being much more effective than the original shape in dusting\r\ninsect servitors with pollen. Not only the forms of flowers but their\r\nmassing has been determined by insect preferences; a wide profusion of\r\nblossoms grow in spikes, umbels, racemes and other clusters, all\r\neconomizing the time of winged allies, and attracting their attention\r\nfrom afar as scattered blossoms would fail to do. Besides this massing,\r\nwe have union more intimate still as in the dandelion, the sun-flower\r\nand the marigold. These and their fellow composites each seem an\r\nindividual; a penknife discloses each of them to be an aggregate of\r\nblossoms. So gainful has this kind of co-operation proved that\r\ncomposites are now dominant among plants in every quarter of the globe.\r\nAs to how composites grew before they learned that union is strength, a\r\nhint is dropped in the \"sport\" of the daisy known as \"the hen and\r\nchickens,\" where perhaps as many as a dozen florets, each on a stalk of\r\nits own, ray out from a mother flower.\r\n\r\nWhile for the most part insects have been mere choosers from among\r\nvarious styles of architecture set before them by plants, they have\r\nsometimes risen to the dignity of builders on their own account, and\r\nwithout ever knowing it. The buttress of the larkspur has sprung forth\r\nin response to the pressure of one bee's weight after another, and many\r\na like structure has had the very same origin,--or shall we say,\r\nprovocation? In these and in other examples unnumbered, culminating in\r\nthe marvellous orchids and their ministers, there has come about the\r\nclosest adaptation of flower-shape to insect-form, the one now clearly\r\nthe counterpart of the other.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget that the hospitality of a flower is after all the\r\nhospitality of an inn-keeper who earns and requires payment. Vexed as\r\nflowers are apt to be by intruders that consume their stores without\r\nrequital, no wonder that they present so ample an array of repulsion and\r\ndefence. Best of all is such a resource as that of the red clover, which\r\nhides its honey at the bottom of a tube so deep that only a friendly\r\nbumblebee can sip it. Less effective, but well worth a moment's\r\nexamination, are the methods by which leaves are opposed as fences for\r\nthe discouragement of thieves. Here, in a Bellwort, is a perfoliate leaf\r\nthat encircles the stem upon which it grows; and there in a Honeysuckle\r\nis a connate leaf on much the same plan, formed of two leaves, stiff and\r\nstrong, soldered at their bases. Sometimes the pillager meets prickles\r\nthat sting him, as in the roses and briers; and if he is a little fellow\r\nhe is sure to regard him with intense disgust, a bristly guard of wiry\r\nhair--hence the commonness of that kind of fortification. Against\r\nenemies of larger growth a tree or shrub will often aim sharp\r\nthorns--another piece of masquerade, for thorns are but branches checked\r\nin growth, and frowning with a barb in token of disappointment at not\r\nbeing able to smile in a blossom. In every jot and tittle of barb and\r\nprickle, of the glossiness which disheartens or the gumminess which\r\nensnares, we may be sure that equally with all the lures of hue, form\r\nand scent, nothing, however trifling it may seem, is as we find it,\r\nexcept through usefulness long tested and approved. In flowers, much\r\nthat at first glance looks like idle decoration, on closer scrutiny\r\nreveals itself as service in disguise. In penetrating these disguises\r\nand many more of other phases, the student of flowers delights to busy\r\nhimself. He loves, too, to detect the cousinship of plants through all\r\nthe change of dress and habit due to their rearing under widely\r\ndifferent skies and nurture, to their being surrounded by strangely\r\ncontrasted foes and friends. Often he can link two plants together only\r\nby going into partnership with a student of the rocks, by turning back\r\nthe records of the earth until he comes upon a flower long extinct, a\r\nplant which ages ago found the struggle for life too severe for it. He\r\never takes care to observe his flowers accurately and fully, but chiefly\r\nthat he may rise from observation to explanation, from bare facts to\r\ntheir causes, from declaring What, to understanding, Whence and How.\r\n\r\nOne of the stock resources of novelists, now somewhat out of date, was\r\nthe inn-keeper who beamed in welcome of his guest, grasped his hand in\r\ngladness, and loaded a table for him in tempting array, and all with\r\nintent that later in the day (or night) he might the more securely\r\nplunge a dagger into his victim's heart--if, indeed, he had not already\r\nimproved an opportunity to offer to that victim's lips a poisoned cup.\r\nThis imagined treachery might well have been suggested by the behaviour\r\nof certain alluring plants that so far from repelling thieves, or\r\ndiscouraging pillagers, open their arms to all comers--with purpose of\r\nthe deadliest. Of these betrayers the chief is the round-leaved sun-dew,\r\nwhich plies its nefarious vocation all the way from Labrador to Florida.\r\nIts favourite site is a peat-bog or a bit of swampy lowland, where in\r\nJuly and August we can see its pretty little white blossoms beckoning to\r\nwayfaring flies and moths their token of good cheer! Circling the\r\nflower-stalk, in rosette fashion, are a dozen or more round leaves, each\r\nof them wearing scores of glands, very like little pins, a drop of gum\r\nglistening on each and every pin by way of head. This appetizing gum is\r\nno other than a fatal stick-fast, the raying pins closing in its aid the\r\nmore certainly to secure a hapless prisoner. Soon his prison-house\r\nbecomes a stomach for his absorption. Its duty of digestion done, the\r\nleaf in all seeming guilessness once more expands itself for the\r\nenticement of a dupe. To see how much the sun-dew must depend upon its\r\nmeal of insects we have only to pull it up from the ground. A touch\r\nsuffices--it has just root enough to drink by; the soil in which it\r\nmakes, and perhaps has been obliged to make, its home has nothing else\r\nbut drink to give it.\r\n\r\nLess accomplished in its task of assassination is the common butterwort\r\nto be found on wet rocks in scattered districts of Canada and the States\r\nadjoining Canada. Surrounding its pretty violet flowers, of funnel\r\nshape, are gummy leaves which close upon their all too trusting guests,\r\nbut with less expertness than the sun-dew's. The butterwort is but a\r\n'prentice hand in the art of murder, and its intended victims often\r\nmanage to get away from it. Built on a very different model is the\r\nbladderwort, busy in stagnant ponds near the sea coast from Nova Scotia\r\nto Texas. Its little white spongy bladders, about a tenth of an inch\r\nacross, encircle the flowering stem by scores. From each bladder a bunch\r\nof twelve or fifteen hairy prongs protrude, giving the structure no\r\nslight resemblance to an insect form. These prongs hide a valve which,\r\nas many an unhappy little swimmer can attest, opens inward easily\r\nenough, but opens outward never. As in the case of its cousinry a-land,\r\nthe bladderwort at its leisure dines upon its prey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Venus' Fly Trap--Open with a Welcome]\r\n\r\nIn marshy places near the mouth of the Cape Fear River, in the vicinity\r\nof Wilmington, North Carolina, grows the Venus' fly-trap, most wonderful\r\nof all the death-dealers of vegetation. Like much else in nature's\r\nhandiwork this plant might well have given inventors a hint worth\r\ntaking. The hairy fringes of its leaves are as responsive to a touch\r\nfrom moth or fly as the sensitive plant itself. And he must be either a\r\nvery small or a particularly sturdy little captive that can escape\r\nthrough the sharp opposed teeth of its formidable snare. It is one of\r\nthe unexplained puzzles of plant life that the Venus' fly-trap, so\r\nmarvellous in its ingenuity, should not only be confined to a single\r\ndistrict, but should seem to be losing its hold of even that small\r\nkingdom. Of still another type is the pitcher plant, or side-saddle\r\nflower, which flaunts its deep purple petals in June in many a peat-bog\r\nfrom Canada southward to Louisiana and Florida. Its leaves develop\r\nthemselves into lidded cups, half-filled with sweetish juice, which\r\nfirst lures a fly or ant, then makes him tipsy, and then despatches him.\r\nThe broth resulting is both meat and drink to the plant, serving as a\r\nstore and reservoir against times of drought and scarcity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shut for Slaughter]\r\n\r\nNow the question is, How came about this strange and somewhat horrid\r\nmeans of livelihood? How did plants of so diverse families turn the\r\ntables on the insect world, and learn to eat instead of being themselves\r\ndevoured? A beginner in the builder's art finds it much more gainful to\r\nexamine the masonry of foundations, the rearing of walls, the placing of\r\ngirders and joists, the springing of arches and buttresses, than to look\r\nat a cathedral, a courthouse, or a bank, finished and in service. In\r\nlike manner a student of insect-eating plants tries to find their leaves\r\nin the making, in all the various stages which bridge their common forms\r\nwith the shapes they assume when fully armed and busy. Availing himself\r\nof the relapses into old habits which plants occasionally exhibit under\r\ncultivation, Mr. Dickson has taught us much regarding the way the\r\npitcher plant of Australia, the _Cephalotus_, has come to be what it is.\r\nHe has arranged in a connected series all the forms of its leaf from\r\nthat of a normal leaf with a mere dimple in it, to the deeply pouched\r\nand lidded pitcher ready for deceitful hospitalities. And similar\r\ntransformations have without doubt taken place in the pitcher plants of\r\nAmerica. Observers in the Cape of Good Hope have noted two plants\r\n_Roridula dentata_ and _Biblys gigantea_, which are evidently following\r\nin the footsteps of the sundews, and may be expected in the fulness of\r\nyears to be their equal partners in crime. But why need we wander so far\r\nas South Africa to find the germs of this strange rapacity when we can\r\nsee at home a full dozen species of catch-fly, sedums, primulas, and\r\ngeraniums pouring out glutinous juices in which insects are entangled?\r\nLet stress of hunger, long continued, force any of these to turn its\r\nattention to the dietary thus proffered, and how soon might not the\r\nplant find in felony the sustenance refused to honest toil?\r\n\r\nBut after all the plants that have meat for dinner are only a few. The\r\ngreater part of the vegetable kingdom draws its supplies from the air\r\nand the soil. Those plants, and they are many, that derive their chief\r\nnourishment from the atmosphere have a decidedly thin diet. Which of us\r\nwould thrive on milk at the rate of a pint to five hogsheads of water?\r\nSuch is the proportion in which air contains carbonic acid gas, the main\r\nsource of strength for many thousands of trees, shrubs, and other\r\nplants. No wonder that they array themselves in so broad an expanse of\r\nleafage. An elm with a spread of seventy feet is swaying in the summer\r\nbreeze at least five acres of foliage as its lungs and stomach. Beyond\r\nthe shade of elms and maples let us stroll past yonder stretch of\r\npasture and we shall notice how the grass in patches here and there\r\ndeepens into green of the richest--a plain token of moisture in the\r\nhollows--a blessing indeed in this dry weather. In the far West and\r\nNorthwest the buffalo grass has often to contend with drought for months\r\ntogether, so that it has learned to strike deep in quest of water to\r\nquench its thirst. It is a by-word among the ranchmen that the roots go\r\nclear through the earth and are clinched as they sprout from the ground\r\nin China. Joking apart, they have been found sixty-eight feet below the\r\nsurface of the prairie, and often in especially dry seasons cattle would\r\nperish were not these faithful little well-diggers and pumpers\r\nconstantly at work for them. In the river valleys of Arizona although\r\nthe air is dry the subsoil water is near the surface of the ground. Here\r\nflourishes the mesquit tree, _Prosopis juliflora_, with a tale to tell\r\nwell worth knowing. When a mesquit seems stunted, it is because its\r\nstrength is withdrawn for the task of delving to find water; where a\r\ntree grows tall with goodly branches, it betokens success in reaching\r\nmoisture close at hand. Thus in shrewdly reading the landscape a\r\nprospector can choose the spot where with least trouble he can sink his\r\nwell. And plants discover provender in the soil as well as drink. Nearer\r\nhome than Arizona we have only to dislodge a beach pea from the ground\r\nto see how far in search of food its roots have dug amid barren stones\r\nand pebbles. Often one finds a plant hardly a foot high with roots\r\nextending eight feet from its stem.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond the beaches where the beach peas dig so diligently are the\r\nseaweeds--with a talent for picking and choosing all their own. Dr.\r\nJulius Sachs, a leading German botanist, believes that the parts of\r\nplants owe their form, as crystals do, to their peculiarities of\r\nsubstance; that just as salt crystallizes in one shape and sugar in\r\nanother, so a seaweed or a tulip is moulded by the character of its\r\njuices. Something certainly of the crystal's faculty for picking out\r\nparticles akin to itself, and building with them, is shown by the kelp\r\nwhich attracts from the ocean both iodine and bromine--often dissolved\r\nthough they are in a million times their bulk of sea water. This trait\r\nof choosing this or that dish from the feast afforded by sea or soil or\r\nair is not peculiar to the seaweeds; every plant displays it. Beech\r\ntrees love to grow on limestone and thus declare to the explorer the\r\nlimestone ridge he seeks. In the Horn silver mine, of Utah, the zinc\r\nmingled with the silver ore is betrayed by the abundance of the zinc\r\nviolet, a delicate and beautiful cousin of the pansy. In Germany this\r\nlittle flower is admittedly a signal of zinc in the earth, and zinc is\r\nfound in its juices. The late Mr. William Dorn, of South Carolina, had\r\nfaith in a bush, of unrecorded name, as betokening gold-bearing veins\r\nbeneath it. That his faith was not without foundation is proved by the\r\nlarge fortune he won as a gold miner in the Blue Ridge country--his\r\nguide the bush aforesaid. Mr. Rossiter W. Raymond, the eminent mining\r\nengineer of New York, has given some attention to this matter of\r\n\"indicative plants.\" He is of the opinion that its unwritten lore among\r\npractical miners, prospectors, hunters, and Indians is well worth\r\nsifting. Their observations, often faulty, may occasionally be sound and\r\nvaluable enough richly to repay the trouble of separating truth from\r\nerror. When we see how important as signs of water many plants can be,\r\nwhy may we not find other plants denoting the minerals which they\r\nespecially relish as food or condiment?\r\n\r\nOf more account than gold or silver are the harvests of wheat and corn\r\nthat ripen in our fields. There the special appetites of plants have\r\nmuch more than merely curious interest for the farmer. He knows full\r\nwell that his land is but a larder which serves him best when not part\r\nbut all its stores are in demand. Hence his crop \"rotation,\" his\r\nsuccession of wheat to clover, of grass to both. Were he to grow barley\r\nevery year he would soon find his soil bared of all the food that barley\r\nasks, while fare for peas or clover stood scarcely broached. If he\r\ninsists on planting barley always, then he must perforce restore to the\r\nland the food for barley constantly withdrawn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Maple Seed, with pair of wings]\r\n\r\nA plant may diligently find food and drink, pour forth delicious nectar,\r\narray itself with flowers as gayly as it can, and still behold its work\r\nunfinished. Its seed may be produced in plenty, and although as far as\r\nthat goes it is well, it is not enough. Of what avail is all this seed\r\nif it falls as it ripens upon soil already overcrowded with its kind?\r\nHence the vigorous emigration policy to be observed in plants of every\r\nname. Hence the fluffy sails set to catch the passing breeze by the\r\ndandelion, the thistle and by many more, including the southern plant of\r\nsnowy wealth whose wings are cotton. With the same intent of seeking new\r\nfields are the hooks of the burdock, the unicorn plant, and the\r\nbur-parsley which impress as carriers the sheep and cattle upon a\r\nthousand hills. The Touch-me-not and the herb Robert adopt a different\r\nplan, and convert their seed-cases into pistols for the firing of seeds\r\nat as wide range as twenty feet or more. The maple, the ash, the\r\nhornbeam, the elm and the birch have yet another method of escape from\r\nthe home acre. Their seeds are winged, and torn off in a gale are\r\nfrequently borne two hundred yards away. And stronger wings than these\r\nare plied in the cherry tree's service. The birds bide the time when a\r\nblush upon the fruit betrays its ripeness. Then the cherries are\r\ngreedily devoured, and their seed, preserved from digestion in their\r\nstony cases are borne over hill, dale, and river to some islet or\r\nbrookside where a sprouting cherry plant will be free from the stifling\r\nrivalries suffered by its parent. Yoked in harness with sheep, ox, and\r\nbird as planter is yonder nimble squirrel. We need not begrudge him the\r\nstore of nuts he hides. He will forget some of them, he will be\r\nprevented by fright or frost from nibbling yet more, and so without\r\nintending it he will ensure for others and himself a sure succession of\r\nacorns and butternuts.\r\n\r\nVery singular are the seeds that have come to resemble beetles; among\r\nthese may be mentioned the seeds of the castor-oil plant and of the\r\n_Iatropha_. The pod of the _Biserrula_ looks like a worm, and a worm\r\nhalf-coiled might well have served as a model for the mimicry of the\r\n_Scorpiurus vermiculata_. All these are much more likely to enlist the\r\nservices of birds than if their resemblances to insects were less\r\nstriking.\r\n\r\nNature elsewhere rich in hints to the gardener and the farmer is not\r\nsilent here. A lesson plainly taught in all this apparatus for the\r\ndispersal of seeds is that the more various the planting the fuller the\r\nharvest. Now that from the wheat fields comes a cry of disappearing\r\ngains, it is time to heed the story told in the unbroken prairie that\r\ndiversity in sowing means wealth in reaping.\r\n\r\nIn a field of growing flax we can find--somewhat oftener than the farmer\r\nlikes--a curious tribe of plants, the dodders. Their stems are thin and\r\nwiry, and their small white flowers, globular in shape, make the azure\r\nblossoms of the flax all the lovelier by contrast. As their cousins the\r\nmorning glories are to this day, the dodders in their first estate were\r\ntrue climbers. Even now they begin life in an honest kind of way with\r\nroots of their own that go forth as roots should, seeking food where it\r\nis to be found in the soil. But if we pull up one of these little\r\nclub-shaped roots we shall see that it has gone to work feebly and\r\ndoubtfully; it seems to have a skulking expectation of dinner without\r\nhaving to dig and delve for it in the rough dirty ground. Nor is this\r\nexpectation unfounded. Watch the stem of a sister dodder as it rises\r\nfrom the earth day by day, and it will be observed to clasp a stalk of\r\nflax very tightly; so tightly that its suckers will absorb the juices of\r\nits unhappy host. When, so very easily, it can regale itself with food\r\nready to hand why should it take the trouble to drudge for a living?\r\n\r\nLike many another pauper demoralized by being fed in idleness, the plant\r\nnow abandons honest toil, its roots from lack of exercise wither away,\r\nand for good and all it ceases to claim any independence whatever.\r\nIndeed, so deep is the dodder's degradation that if it cannot find a\r\nstem of flax, or hop, or other plant whereon to climb and thrive, it\r\nwill simply shrivel and die rather than resume habits of industry so\r\nlong renounced as to be at last forgotten.\r\n\r\nLike the lowly dodder the mistletoe is a climber that has discovered\r\nlarge opportunities of theft in ascending the stem of a supporting\r\nplant. On this continent the mistletoe scales a wide variety of trees\r\nand shrubs, preferring poplars and apple trees, where these are to be\r\nhad. Its extremely slender stem, its meagre leaves, its small flowers,\r\ngreenish and leathery, are all eloquent as to the loss of strength and\r\nbeauty inevitable to a parasite. Rising as this singular plant does out\r\nof the branches of another with a distinct life all its own, it is no\r\nother than a natural graft, and it is very probable that from the hint\r\nit so unmistakably gives the first gardeners were not slow to adopt\r\ngrafts artificial--among the resources which have most enriched and\r\ndiversified both flowers and fruits. The dodders and mistletoes rob\r\njuices from the stem and branches of their unfortunate hosts; more\r\nnumerous still are the unbidden guests that fasten themselves upon the\r\nroots of their prey. The broom-rape, a comparatively recent immigrant\r\nfrom Europe, lays hold of the roots of thyme in preference to other\r\nplace of entertainment; the Yellow Rattle, the Lousewort, and many more\r\nattach themselves to the roots of grasses--frequently with a serious\r\ncurtailment of crop.\r\n\r\nYet in this very department of hers Nature has for ages hidden away what\r\nhas been disclosed within twenty years as one of her least suspected\r\nmarvels. It is no other than that certain parasites of field and meadow\r\nso far from being hurtful, are well worth cultivating for the good they\r\ndo. For a long time the men who devoted themselves to the study of peas,\r\nbeans, clovers, and other plants of the pulse family, were confronted\r\nwith a riddle they could not solve. These plants all manage to enrich\r\nthemselves with compounds of nitrogen, which make them particularly\r\nvaluable as food, and these compounds often exist in a degree far\r\nexceeding the rate at which their nitrogen comes out of the soil. And\r\nthis while they have no direct means of seizing upon the nitrogen\r\ncontained in its great reservoir--the atmosphere. Upon certain roots of\r\nbeans and peas it was noted that there were little round excrescences\r\nabout the size of a small pin's head. These excrescences on examination\r\nwith a microscope proved to be swarming with bacteria of minute\r\ndimensions. Further investigation abundantly showed that these little\r\nguests paid a handsome price for their board and lodging--while they\r\nsubsisted in part on the juices of their host they passed into the bean\r\nor pea certain valuable compounds of nitrogen which they built from\r\ncommon air. At the Columbian Exposition, of 1893, one of the striking\r\nexhibits in the Agricultural Building set this forth in detail. Vials\r\nwere shown containing these tiny subterranean aids to the farmer, and\r\nlarge photographs showed in natural size the vast increase of crop due\r\nto the farmer's taking bacteria into partnership. To-day these little\r\norganisms are cultivated of set purpose, and quest is being made for\r\nsimilar bacteria suitable to be harnessed in producing wheat, corn, and\r\nother harvests.\r\n\r\nThese are times when men of science are discontented with mere\r\nobservation. They wish to pass from watching things as nature presents\r\nthem to putting them into relations wholly new. In 1866 DeBary, a close\r\nobserver of lichens, felt confident that a lichen was not the simple\r\ngrowth it seems, but a combination of fungus and algæ. This opinion, so\r\nmuch opposed to honoured tradition, was scouted, but not for long.\r\nBefore many months had passed Stahl took known algæ, and upon them sowed\r\na known fungus, the result was a known lichen! The fungus turns out to\r\nbe no other than a slave-driver that captures algæ in colonies and makes\r\nthem work for him. He is, however, a slave-driver of an intelligent\r\nsort; his captives thrive under his mastery, and increase more rapidly\r\nfor the healthy exercise he insists that they shall take.\r\n\r\nIt is an afternoon in August and the sultry air compels us to take\r\nshelter in a grove of swaying maples. Beneath their shade every square\r\nyard of ground bears a score of infant trees, very few of them as much\r\nas a foot in stature. How vain their expectation of one day enjoying an\r\nample spread of branch and root, of rising to the free sunshine of upper\r\nair! The scene, with its quivering rounds of sunlight, seems peace\r\nitself, but the seeming is only a mask for war as unrelenting as that\r\nof weaponed armies. For every ray of the sunbeam, for every atom of\r\nfood, for every inch of standing room, there is deadly rivalry. To begin\r\nthe fight is vastly easier than to maintain it, and not one in a hundred\r\nof these bantlings will ever know maturity. We have only to do what\r\nDarwin did--count the plants that throng a foot of sod in spring, count\r\nthem again in summer, and at the summer's end, to find how great the\r\ninexorable carnage in this unseen combat, how few its survivors. So hard\r\nhere is the fight for a foothold, for daily bread, that the playfulness\r\ninborn in every healthy plant can peep out but timidly and seldom. But\r\nwhen strife is exchanged for peace, when a plant is once safely\r\nsheltered behind a garden fence, then the struggles of the battlefield\r\ngive place to the diversions of the garrison--diversions not\r\ninfrequently hilarious enough. Now food abounds and superabounds;\r\nhenceforth neither drought nor deluge can work their evil will; insect\r\nfoes, as well as may be, are kept at bay; there is room in plenty\r\ninstead of dismal overcrowding. The grateful plant repays the care\r\nbestowed upon it by bursting into a sportiveness unsuspected, and indeed\r\nimpossible, amidst the alarms and frays incessant in the wilderness. It\r\ndeparts from parental habits in most astonishing fashion, puts forth\r\nblossoms of fresh grace of form, of new dyes, of doubled magnitude. The\r\ngardener's opportunity has come. He can seize upon such of these\r\n\"sports\" as he chooses and make them the confirmed habits of his wards.\r\nTake a stroll through his parterres and greenhouses, where side by side\r\nhe shows you pansies of myriad tints and the modest little wild violets\r\nof kindred to the pansies' ancestral stock. Let him contrast for you\r\nroses, asters, tuberous begonias, hollyhocks, dahlias, pelargoniums,\r\nbefore cultivation and since. Were wild flowers clay, were the gardener\r\nboth painter and sculptor, he could not have wrought marvels more\r\nglorious than these. In a few years the brethren of his guild have\r\nbrought about a revolution for which, if possible at all to her, nature\r\nin the open fields would ask long centuries. And the gardener's\r\nexperiments with these strange children of his have all the charm of\r\nsurprise. No passive chooser is he of \"sports\" of promise, but an active\r\nmatchmaker between flowers often brought together from realms as far\r\napart as France and China. Sometimes his experiment is an instant\r\nsuccess. Mr. William Paul, a famous creator of splendid flowers, tells\r\nus that at a time when climbing roses were either white or yellow, he\r\nthought he would like to produce one of bright dark colour. Accordingly\r\nhe mated the Rose Athelin, of vivid crimson, with Russelliana, a hardy\r\nclimber, and lo, the flower he had imagined and longed for stood\r\nrevealed! But this hitting the mark at the first shot is uncommon good\r\nfortune with the gardener. No experience with primrose or chrysanthemum\r\nis long and varied enough to tell him how the crossing of two different\r\nstocks will issue. A rose which season after season opposes only\r\nindifference to all his pains may be secretly gathering strength for a\r\nbound beyond its ancestral paths which will carry it much farther than\r\nhis hopes, or, perhaps, his wishes.\r\n\r\nMost flowers are admired for their own sweet sake, but who thinks less\r\nof an apple or cherry blossom because it bears in its beauty the promise\r\nof delicious fruit? Put a red Astrachan beside a sorry crab, a Bartlett\r\npear next a tough, diminutive wild pear such as it is descended from, an\r\near of milky corn in contrast with an ear one-fourth its size, each\r\ngrain of which, small and dry, is wrapped in a sheath by itself; and\r\nrejoice that fruits and grains as well as flowers can learn new lessons\r\nand remember them. At Concord, Massachusetts, in an honoured old age,\r\ndwells Mr. Ephraim W. Bull. In his garden he delights to show the mother\r\nvine of the Concord grape which he developed from a native wild grape\r\nplanted as long ago as 1843. Another \"sport\" of great value was the\r\nnectarine, which was seized upon as it made its appearance on a peach\r\nbough. Throughout America are scattered experiment stations, part of\r\nwhose business it is to provoke fresh varieties of wheat, or corn, or\r\nother useful plant, and make permanent such of them as show special\r\nrichness of yield; earliness in ripening; stoutness of resistance to\r\nJack Frost, or blight, or insect pests. Suppose that dire disaster\r\nswept from off the earth every cereal used as food. Professor Goodale,\r\nProfessor Asa Gray's successor at Harvard University, has so much\r\nconfidence in the experiment stations of America that he deems them well\r\nable to repair the loss we have imagined; within fifty years, he thinks,\r\nfrom plants now uncultivated the task could be accomplished. Among the\r\nmen who have best served the world by hastening nature's steps in the\r\nimprovement of flowers and fruits, stands Mr. Vilmorin, of Paris. He it\r\nwas who in creating the sugar beet laid the foundation for one of the\r\nchief industries of our time. One of his rules is to select at first not\r\nthe plant which varies most in the direction he wishes, but the plant\r\nthat varies most in any direction whatever. From it, from the\r\ninstability of its very fibres, its utter forgetfulness of ancestral\r\ntraditions, he finds it easiest in the long run to obtain and to\r\nestablish the character he seeks of sweetness, or size, or colour.\r\n\r\nOf flowering plants there are about 110,000, of these the farmer and the\r\ngardener between them have scarcely tamed and trained 1,000. What new\r\nriches, therefore, may we not expect from the culture of the future?\r\nAlready in certain northern flower-pots the trillium, the bloodroot, the\r\ndog's-tooth violet, and the celandine are abloom in May; as June\r\nadvances, the wild violet, the milkweed, the wild lily-of-the-valley,\r\nunfold their petals; later in summer the dog-rose displays its charms\r\nand breathes its perfume. All respond kindly to care, and were there\r\nmore of this hospitality, were the wild roses which the botanist calls\r\n_blanda_ and _lucida_, were the cardinal flowers, the May flowers, and\r\nmany more of the treasures of glen and meadow, made welcome with\r\nthoughtful study of their wants and habits, much would be done to extend\r\nthe wealth of our gardens. Let a hepatica be plucked from its home in a\r\nrocky crevice where one marvels how it ever contrived to root itself and\r\nfind subsistence. Transplant it to good soil, give it a little care--it\r\nasks none--and it will thrive as it never throve before; proving once\r\nagain that plants do not grow where they like, but where they can. The\r\nRussian columbine rewards its cultivator with a wealth of blossoms that\r\nplainly say how much it rejoices in his nurture of it, in its escape\r\nfrom the frost and tempest that have assailed it for so many\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nBut here we must be content to take a leaf out of nature's book, and\r\nlook for small results unless our experiments are broadly planned. It is\r\nin great nurseries and gardens, not in little door-yards that \"sports\"\r\nare likely to arise, and to meet the skill which can confirm them as new\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nJapan has much to teach us with regard to flowers: nowhere else on earth\r\nare they so sedulously cultivated, or so faithfully studied in all their\r\nchangeful beauty. Perhaps the most striking revelation of the Japanese\r\ngardener is his treatment of flowering shrubs and flowering trees\r\ndisposed in masses. Happy the visitors to Tokio who sees in springtime\r\nthe cherry blossoms ready to lend their witchery to the Empress's\r\nreception! Much is done to extend the reign of beauty in a garden when\r\nit is fitly bordered with berry-bearers. Rows of mountain ash,\r\nsnow-berry, and hawthorn trees give colour just when colour is most\r\neffective, at the time when most flowers are past and gone.\r\n\r\nIn the practical bit of ground where the kitchen garden meets the\r\nflowers, Japan has long since enlarged its bill of fare with the tuber\r\nof a cousin of our common hedge nettle, with the roots of the large\r\nburdock, commoner still. In Florida, the calla lily has use as well as\r\nbeauty; it is cultivated for its potato-like tubers.\r\n\r\nMuch as the study of flowers heightens our interest in them, their\r\nfirst, their chief enduring charm consists in their simple beauty--their\r\ninfinitely varied grace of form, their exhaustless wealth of changeful\r\ntints. Off we go with delight from desk and book to a breezy field, a\r\nwimpling brook, a quiet pond in woodland shade. A dozen rambles from May\r\nto October will show us all the floral procession, which, beginning with\r\nthe trilliums and the violets, ends at the approach of frost with the\r\ngolden-rod and aster. But who ever formed an engaging acquaintance\r\nwithout wishing it might become a close friendship? Never yet did the\r\nobservant culler of bloodroot and columbine rest satisfied with merely\r\nknowing their names, and how can more be known unless flowers are set\r\nup in a portrait gallery of their own for the leisurely study of their\r\nlineaments and lineage?\r\n\r\nA word then as to the best way to gather wild flowers. A case for them\r\nin the form of a round tube, closed at the ends, with a hinged cover,\r\ncan be made by a tinsmith at small cost. Its dimensions should be about\r\nthirty inches in length by five inches in diameter, with a strap\r\nattached to carry it by. At still less expense a frame can be made, or\r\nbought, formed of two boards, one-eighth of an inch thick, twenty-four\r\ninches long and eighteen inches broad, with two thin battens fastened\r\nacross them to prevent warping. A quire of soft brown paper, newspaper\r\nwill do, and a strap to hold all together, complete the outfit.\r\n\r\nOur gathered treasures at home, we may wish to deck a table or a mantel\r\nwith a few of them. The lives of impressed blossoms can be, much\r\nprolonged by exercising a little care. Punch holes in a round of\r\ncardboard and put the stalks through these holes before placing the\r\nflowers in a vase. This prevents the stalks touching each other, and so\r\ndecaying before their time. A little charcoal in the water tends to keep\r\nit pure; the water should be changed daily.\r\n\r\nA flower will fade at last be it tended ever so carefully. If we wish to\r\npreserve it dried we can best do so as soon as we bring it home, by\r\nplacing it between sheets of absorbent paper (newspaper will do) well\r\nweighted down, the paper to be renewed if the plants are succulent and\r\nif there is any risk of mildew. But a dried plant after all is only a\r\nmummy. Its colours are gone; its form bruised and crumpled, gives only a\r\nfaint suggestion of it as it lived and breathed. Other and more pleasant\r\nreminders of our summer rambles can be ours. With a camera of fair size\r\nit is easy to take pictures of flowers at their best; these pictures can\r\nbe coloured in their natural tints with happy effect. In this art Mrs.\r\nCornelius Van Brunt, of New York, has attained extraordinary success.\r\nOr, instead of the camera, why not at first invoke the brush and\r\ncolour-box? Only a little skill in handling them is enough for a\r\nbeginning. Practice soon increases deftness in this art as in every\r\nother, and in a few short weeks floral portraits are painted with a\r\ntruth to nature denied the unaided pencil. For what flower, however meek\r\nand lowly, could ever tell its story in plain black and white?\r\n\r\nThe amateur painter of flowers learns a good many things by the way; at\r\nthe very outset, that drawing accurate and clear must be the groundwork\r\nof any painting worthy the name. Both in the use of pencil and brush\r\nthere must be a degree of painstaking observation, wholesome as a\r\ndiscipline and delightful in its harvests. How many of us, unused to the\r\ntask of careful observation, can tell the number of the musk-mallow's\r\npetals, or mark on paper the depth of fringe on a gentian, or match from\r\na series of dyed silks the hues of a common buttercup? Drawing and\r\npainting sharpen the eye, and make the fingers its trained and ready\r\nservants. From the very beginning of one's task in limning bud and\r\nblossom, we see them richer in grace and loveliness than ever before.\r\nWhen wild flowers are sketched as they grow it is often easy to give\r\nthem a new interest by adding the portraits of their insect servitors.\r\nAmateurs who are so fortunate as to visit the West Indies have an\r\nopportunity to paint the wonderful blossoms of the Marcgravia, whose\r\nminister, a humming bird, quivers above it like a bit of rainbow\r\nloosened from the sky.\r\n\r\nEarly in the history of art the wild flowers lent their aid to\r\ndecoration. The acanthus which gave its leaves to crest the capital of\r\nthe Corinthian column, the roses conventionalized in the rich fabrics of\r\nancient Persia, until they have been thought sheer inventions of the\r\nweaver, are among the first items of an indebtedness which has steadily\r\ngrown in volume until to-day, when the designers who find their\r\ninspiration in the flowers are a vast and increasing host. In a modern\r\nmansion of the best type the outer walls are enriched with the leonine\r\nbeauty of the sun-flower; within, the mosaic floors, the silk, and paper\r\nhangings, repeat themes suggested by the vine, the wild clematis and the\r\nMayflower. The stained glass windows from New York, where their\r\nmanufacture excels that of any other city in the world, are exquisite\r\nwith boldly treated lilies, poppies, and columbines. In the\r\ndrawing-room are embroideries designed by two young women of Salem,\r\nMassachusetts, who have established a thriving industry in transferring\r\nthe glow of wild flowers to the adornment of noble houses such as this.\r\nAs one goes from studio to studio, it is cheering to find so many men\r\nand women busy at work which is more joyful than play,--which in many\r\ncases first taken up as a recreation disclosed a vein of genuine talent\r\nand so pointed to a career more delightful than any other,--because it\r\nchimes in with the love of beauty and the power of giving it worthy\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTE: Unable to verify \"partnery\" nor \"tucu-tucu\", but\r\nthey have been left as in the original.\r\n\r\nThe word \"sylvain\" has been verified as a valid word, and therefore\r\nit has been left as in the original.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Little Masterpieces of Science:, by Various",
