LTD.\r\n36 ESSEX STREET W.C.\r\nLONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _First Published April 14th 1910_\r\n    _Second Edition  May        1910_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume is a collection of some of the papers which I have\r\ncontributed to the _Daily Telegraph_ during the years 1908-1909, under\r\nthe title “Science from an Easy Chair.” I have revised and corrected the\r\nletterpress, and have added some illustrations. A smaller volume\r\ncontaining earlier papers was published by Messrs. Constable in 1908,\r\nwith the title _From an Easy Chair_. It is my intention now to produce\r\nadditional volumes (under the title “Easy Chair Series”) as their\r\nconstituent articles accumulate, and I hope to be able to publish a\r\nsecond and a third instalment at no distant date.\r\n\r\nI should like to draw the special attention of the reader to the\r\nFrontispiece (Plate I.), which is very beautifully executed, and is, I\r\nbelieve, the first coloured drawing yet published showing the difference\r\nbetween the adult “silver” eel and the more abundant immature “yellow”\r\neel—sometimes called the “frogmouthed eel.” The original drawings were\r\nprepared for me through the kindness of Dr. Petersen, of Copenhagen, who\r\nis the discoverer of many interesting facts about the common eel, and\r\nis director of the Danish Biological Laboratory.\r\n\r\nI also wish to draw the attention of any one who is kind enough to look\r\nat this preface to one or two more of my illustrations, because they\r\nare, I think, of exceptional interest, and should be looked at, at once,\r\nbefore a decision not to read the book is made. These are the\r\nprehistoric engraving of a horse’s head, with rope-bridle in place, on\r\npage 81; the drawings of the leaves of the American Poison-vine and of\r\nthe Virginian Creeper on page 95; of the nettle-sting on page 113; of\r\nthe Dragon of the Hesperides on page 122; of the big tadpoles on page\r\n217; of the jumping bean on page 298, and its moth on page 301; of the\r\nant milking a green-fly for its honey-dew on page 324; and lastly, the\r\naccurate drawing on page 370 of the most ancient human skull yet\r\ndiscovered, and the other drawings of skulls (all to the scale of\r\none-third the actual length), and those of prehistoric weapons and\r\ncarvings which follow it. These drawings have been made from original\r\nscientific memoirs, or in some cases from actual specimens, for the\r\npresent volume.\r\n\r\n  E.

To reveal to other\r\nmen processes, properties, existences in the natural world hitherto\r\nunsuspected, or, if suspected, yet eluding the grasp of man, is to do\r\nsomething which gives to him who does it a sense that he is of value in\r\nthe world—a sense which will uphold him and enable him to endure\r\nadversity, and even persecution, with equanimity. But there is, perhaps,\r\na greater and more vivid satisfaction for those who do or make great and\r\nsplendid things which all men can see, and for which all men are\r\ngrateful. The great artist—poet, painter, builder, or musician—has\r\nthis satisfaction, and so also has the man who, by a combination of\r\npersonal energy and clearness of intellectual vision, applies scientific\r\nknowledge to the accomplishment of great public works, and to the\r\nacquirement of that control by mankind of the natural conditions hostile\r\nto human progress which we may call, as did Lord Bacon, “the\r\nestablishing of the kingdom of man.”\r\n\r\nThe men who have expelled yellow fever from Cuba and Panama have not\r\nmerely done a piece of sanitary cleaning up; they have first imagined\r\nand then created, by the force of human will, directed and maintained by\r\nconviction of the reality of science, a new thing—the tropics without\r\ndeadly fever, the tropics as a healthy and welcome home for the white\r\nman. That is comparable to the work of a great artist in the directness\r\nof its appeal; it is in its actual detail the result of the combination\r\nof the skill of the engineer with the foresight and absolute domination\r\nof his human agents of a military genius.\r\n\r\nFor this magnificent work the highest credit is due to the United States\r\nchief sanitary officer, Colonel Gorgas. It is well known how the\r\nAmerican Medical Commission in Cuba proved six years ago that yellow\r\nfever is conveyed from man to man solely and entirely by a gnat common\r\nin Central America, known as _Stegomyia_, and further, how by carrying\r\nout measures for preventing the entrance of these gnats into\r\ndwelling-houses, and especially by keeping them away from yellow fever\r\npatients so that they fail to obtain and carry the yellow fever germ,\r\neven if they do bite healthy men, Colonel Gorgas and his associates\r\npractically eradicated yellow fever in Cuba. The bite of the _Stegomyia\r\ngnat_ is the only way in which a man can acquire yellow fever, and the\r\ngnat which bites him must have taken up the germs of yellow fever from\r\nanother man—twelve days (no less) previously.\r\n\r\nThe application of this knowledge and the methods devised to give it\r\neffect is what has now rendered the construction of the Panama Canal by\r\nthe United States Government possible. The French Canal Company employed\r\nan army of labourers, numbering from 15,000 to 18,000 men. They lost,\r\nalmost entirely by death from yellow fever and malaria, so many of their\r\nworkmen that others refused to undertake the deadly job, and there was a\r\ngeneral panic. The death-rate was in 1884 over 60 per 1000. In 1885 it\r\nwas over 70 per 1000. The work was abandoned. In May 1904 Colonel Gorgas\r\nand his forces took possession of the canal zone. This is a zone of\r\nterritory running fifty miles north and south, with a good-sized\r\ntown—Colon—at one end of it and another—Panama—at the other end of\r\nit. Many hundreds of men were at once organised and set to work to\r\ndestroy in both the towns the _Stegomyia gnat_. This was effected by\r\ndoing away with all the breeding-places of the gnat, that is, screening\r\nand covering every water receptacle in the town, so that the gnats or\r\nmosquitoes cannot breed. Then a fumigating process was carried out in\r\nall houses and buildings, great and small, to destroy such gnats as were\r\nstill alive. No less than 200,000 lb. of pyrethrum and 400,000 lb. of\r\nsulphur were used in this fumigation. In December 1905 the last case of\r\nyellow fever occurred. It took sixteen months of the work just described\r\nto effect this.\r\n\r\nIn a different way the _Anopheles gnat_ or mosquito, which carries the\r\ngerm of malaria from man to man, was got rid of. This gnat breeds in\r\nclean water, where grass and weeds grow; it belongs chiefly to country\r\ndistricts. As it rarely flies more than 200 yards it was sufficient to\r\ndestroy the breeding pools within that distance of the workmen’s houses,\r\ncamps, and villages. All the windows and doors of all houses were fitted\r\nwith wire-gauze screens, which prevent the entrance of the gnats, and\r\nthe population was furnished with quinin, a dose of 3 grs. a day being\r\nordered to bring the men into such condition that the malaria parasite\r\nwould not thrive in the blood even if introduced.\r\n\r\nThe object with which Colonel Gorgas and his associates started was\r\naccomplished in less than two years. The control of yellow fever and\r\nmalaria has become even more complete in the two years which have\r\nfollowed. It is two years since yellow fever disappeared from the\r\nentire zone, including the two towns. Malaria has not been so completely\r\ndestroyed. The employés of the Canal Commission and Panama Railway now\r\nnumber 45,000. The death-rate of this entire force, including both black\r\n(33,000) and white (12,000) employés, was, in the month of December 1907\r\nonly 18 per 1000 per annum—less than that of the city of Liverpool,\r\nwhich was 20, or that of Salford, which was over 19. Of all the white\r\nemployés the death-rate was only 13 per 1000 per annum. In the year 1906\r\n(whole year), among the 6000 white employés who had come from the United\r\nStates, including some 1200 women and children, their families, the\r\ndeath-rate from disease was only 4 per 1000. Pneumonia has been a chief\r\ncause of death among the negro labourers, but seldom affects the whites.\r\nMalaria caused, in the whole army of labourers, only six deaths in\r\nDecember 1907, as against thirteen in the smaller army at work in the\r\nsame month in 1906. There were 800 cases of malaria in the whole army of\r\n45,000 employés in December 1907.\r\n\r\nIt is thus apparent that Colonel Gorgas has converted this deadly zone\r\nfrom which negroes and white men hurried in a panic of fear twenty years\r\nago into a region as healthy—that is to say, with as low a\r\ndeath-rate—as an ordinary North American or English city. No doubt\r\nallowance must be made in the comparison for the special nature of the\r\npopulation brought together on the canal zone. This is favourable to a\r\nlow death-rate, in so far as it consists of strong adults, excluding old\r\npeople and very young children, but unfavourable in so far as it\r\nconsists of negroes and mean whites, who are even less amenable to\r\nsanitary regulations and precautions than the population of an English\r\ncity. Colonel Gorgas writes that now that it is shown that any\r\npopulation coming into the tropics can protect itself against yellow\r\nfever and malaria by measures which are both simple and inexpensive,\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon will find life in the tropics more healthful than in the\r\ntemperate zones, and tropical countries which offer a much greater\r\nreturn for man’s labour than do those of the chilly temperate zone, will\r\nbe in the course of the next two or three centuries occupied and\r\npopulated by the white races. Such an unpleasantly cold spring as that\r\nwhich all Europe endured last year makes one wish that the tropics\r\ngenerally were already arranged by Colonel Gorgas for our reception, and\r\nprovided with a sanitated white-faced population. We could go and live\r\nthere, warm and comfortable, all the year round, enjoying the rich\r\nluxuriance of tropical nature without fear of either chill or fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY TRAINING\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Manchester last year, when they installed Lord Morley, the Secretary\r\nof State for India, as Chancellor of the University, the Right Hon.\r\nArthur Balfour delivered a very interesting address, in which he\r\ndeclared himself a believer in the gospel of “Science the Master.” Mr.\r\nBalfour’s speech did not imply any disregard for the pursuit of\r\nhistorical knowledge and a training in literature and the use of\r\nlanguage, but it was a clear recognition of the fact that when the great\r\npurpose for which universities exist is considered it must be asserted\r\nin no hesitating terms that the discovery of new knowledge is the most\r\nimportant activity which a university can foster. To train men (and\r\nwomen, too) to use their faculties not merely to acquire knowledge of\r\nwhat has been discovered by others in the past, but to discover new\r\nthings and to gain further control over the conditions in which we live,\r\nand to secure further understanding not only of nature but of man—that\r\nis the great business of the university.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that Mr. Balfour was present and able to strike this\r\nnote, for Lord Morley, the new Chancellor, had not expressed any such\r\nconception of the aims of a university. He declared that, so long as the\r\nGreeks have anything to teach us we should not cease to study the\r\nGreeks. But, whilst we may agree to this, it is well to remember that,\r\nthough pleasure can still be obtained from Greek poetry and prose by\r\nthose who have thoroughly mastered the Greek language, yet almost all,\r\nif not quite all, that the Greeks have to teach us has been by this time\r\ntranslated and dealt with by our own writers. Consequently, although we\r\nmay cordially approve of the study of ancient civilisations and ancient\r\nliteratures and languages, both Greek and barbarian, as part of the\r\nenterprise of a university, it is somewhat excessive, not to say\r\nbelated, to set up the study of Greek or of any other historic language\r\nand civilisation as the chief and distinctive boon which universities\r\ncan offer to their scholars. The matter has, indeed, been thrashed out,\r\nand Greek, together with what is called the “study of literature” (but\r\nis usually an ineffective dabbling in it), has been put into its proper\r\nsubordinate place in all the universities of Europe and in most of those\r\nof Great Britain. The illusion that flowers of speech and mastery of\r\nphrase (though all very well if honestly used) are an indication of any\r\nknowledge or capacity which can be of service to the community, has\r\nbeen, in late years, to a very large extent, dispelled.\r\n\r\nThe concluding words of Mr. Balfour’s speech were: “The great\r\nadvancement of mankind is to be looked for in our ever-increasing\r\nknowledge of the secrets of nature—secrets, however, which are not to\r\nbe unlocked by the men who pursue them for purely material ends, but\r\nsecrets which are open in their fulness only to men who pursue them in a\r\ndisinterested spirit. The motive power which is really going to change\r\nthe external surface of civilisation, which is going to add to the\r\nwell-being of mankind, which is going to stimulate the imagination of\r\nall those who are interested in the universe in which our lot is\r\ncast—that lies after all with science. I would rather be known as\r\nhaving added to the sum of our knowledge of the truth of nature than\r\nanything else I can imagine. Unfortunately for me, my opportunities have\r\nlain in different directions.”\r\n\r\nThat is a splendid confession of faith. I do not remember that any\r\nGerman statesman of like authority and standing has ever given\r\nexpression to so full and ample a belief in the value of science. Yet\r\nGerman statesmen have acted, though they have not spoken. They have\r\narranged for, and continually are arranging for, a far larger\r\nexpenditure of public money upon scientific training and investigation\r\nthan is assigned to such purposes in this country. Every department of\r\ngovernment in Germany has its thoroughly trained, well-taught, well-paid\r\nbody of scientific experts and investigators, and, moreover, the whole\r\nofficial world, from the Emperor downwards, has a real understanding of\r\nwhat science is, of the folly of attempting to proceed without it, or\r\nallowing persons who are ignorant of it to act as administrators. The\r\nneed for science is not merely recognised in words, but steps are taken,\r\nand have been taken now for many years, actually to secure in German\r\npublic offices and public administration the predominance of that\r\nscientific knowledge which the German statesmen, as well as Mr. Balfour,\r\nconsider so necessary. Is it too much to hope that in this country those\r\nwho recognise the value and importance of scientific knowledge will also\r\ntake steps to re-arrange our Government departments so as to give them\r\nthe advantage of guidance by men trained in the knowledge of nature,\r\nrather than by men ignorant of the very existence of such knowledge?\r\n\r\nThe universities hold the central position in this matter, and it is\r\ntheir influence and wealth which the State should insist on directing\r\ntowards the extension and diffusion of science. Those who address the\r\npublic on this subject not infrequently take what seems to me to be a\r\ndisastrous line at the start. They speak of the new universities as the\r\nuniversities of the people, and hand over Oxford and Cambridge, with\r\ntheir enormous endowments, their history and tradition, to the wealthy\r\nclass. Such usurpation cannot be tolerated. It is monstrous that the\r\nendowments of the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, which were\r\nthoroughly popular and democratic in their foundation, should be, even\r\nfor a moment, regarded as the peculiar property of the wealthy. It is\r\nalso monstrous to suppose that it is anything less than disastrous to\r\nconsign the well-to-do classes in any community to an empty sham of\r\nancient “culture” rather than to imbue them with the real and inspiring\r\nculture of the modern renaissance. It is because this notion is allowed\r\nto gain ground that the enormous funds of the colleges and universities\r\nof Oxford and Cambridge, amounting to more than three-quarters of a\r\nmillion pounds annually, are to a large extent, though not exclusively,\r\nemployed in keeping up a couple of huge boarding-schools, which are shut\r\nfor six months in the year.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to this that it is the rarest thing to find in Oxford or in\r\nCambridge a great teacher who lectures or demonstrates to an eager\r\nfollowing of disciples. An overwhelming majority of the young men who go\r\nas students to these universities have no intention of studying\r\nanything. They are sent there in order to be submitted to college\r\ndiscipline and to have, subject to that safeguard, a good time. A large\r\nnumber are handsomely paid by scholarships in order to induce them to go\r\nthere—and would not go there at all unless they were so paid. They do\r\nnot find such teachers there and such an effective occupation of their\r\nstudent years as would induce them, if unpaid, to seek the university,\r\nor to pay fees out of their own pockets for the opportunities of\r\nseriously pursuing any branch of learning or science within its walls.\r\n\r\nThe inefficiency of the old universities is to a large extent the cause\r\nof the neglect and ignorance of science in the well-to-do class, who\r\nfurnish the men who become Government officials of all kinds and members\r\nof professions which influence public opinion. But this inefficiency of\r\nthe old universities is not due to their devotion to literary studies\r\nand to abstract science, nor to their objection to the pursuit of\r\npractical and commercial studies. That excuse is sometimes put forward\r\nfor them, though at this moment they are, in fact, setting up\r\nlaboratories and lecture-rooms for engineering, agriculture, forestry,\r\nmining, and such applications of science. Nor is it money which is\r\nreally wanting at either Oxford or Cambridge, although they are both\r\nbegging for it from the public. What Oxford and Cambridge want is not\r\nmoney but men; men as teachers—“professors” is the usual title given to\r\nthem in a university—who must be the ablest, each in his own line, in\r\nthe whole world. If such professors existed in either Oxford or\r\nCambridge, and were allowed to teach, the town (if not the colleges!)\r\nwould be full to overflowing of students—eager to pay their fees and to\r\nspend, not three short terms of seven weeks in each year, but the whole\r\nyear, and many years, in the laboratories and lecture-rooms of those\r\ncommanding men.\r\n\r\nTo obtain such men—to set the machinery at work—you must pay them\r\nhandsomely, and give them authority and the means of work. Once they\r\nwere at work, the mere fees of the students would furnish a splendid\r\nrevenue. There is plenty of money at Oxford and at Cambridge—a\r\nsuperabundance, in fact—which could and should be applied to this\r\npurpose, namely, that of securing and establishing there the greatest\r\nteachers in the world. The money is at present administered by the\r\ncolleges according to the directions given in recent Acts of Parliament,\r\nand by no means in any blind obedience to the original intentions of the\r\nfounders of the colleges. It is to a large extent wasted. That portion\r\nof it paid out as “scholarships” is for the most part wasted in bringing\r\nstudents to a place where they cannot get the best opportunities of\r\nstudy, and the rest is unwisely applied (not so much by the tenants for\r\nlife or administrators of college funds as by rigid Act of Parliament)\r\nto providing an excessive number of totally inadequate salaries by which\r\na corresponding number of young men are induced to enter upon the career\r\nof teachers as underpaid college Fellows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nDARWIN’S THEORY\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 1st of July 1908, half a century had passed since\r\nDarwin’s Theory of the Origin of Species was made known to the world.\r\nFifty years have now been completed since that immortal book, _The\r\nOrigin of Species_, was published, and a hundred years since Charles\r\nDarwin was born.\r\n\r\nIt is not every one who is in a position to understand how great and\r\nmomentous was the occasion when Sir Charles Lyell and Dr. Joseph Hooker\r\ncommunicated to the Linnean Society of London, on the 1st of July 1858,\r\ntwo papers, one by Charles Darwin, the other by Alfred Russel Wallace,\r\nunder the common title, “On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties:\r\nand on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural means of\r\nSelection.” The reason for this conjoint communication to the Linnean\r\nSociety was that Darwin, who had been working for years at the subject,\r\nand had already, in 1842, drawn up a statement of his theory, not for\r\npublication, but for the consideration and criticism of his friend\r\nHooker—unexpectedly received from Alfred Russel Wallace, who was, and\r\nhad been for some years, away in the Malay Archipelago—a manuscript of\r\nan essay on the origin of species, containing views identical with his\r\nown, and even phrases similar to those he had himself found it\r\nnecessary to invent. Thus Wallace speaks of the “struggle for\r\nexistence,” whilst Darwin had used the term “struggle for life.” Darwin\r\nhad been urged by his friends before this to publish an abstract or\r\nstatement of his conclusions, but now that he had received Wallace’s\r\nmanuscript, he declared in a letter to Hooker, “I would far rather burn\r\nmy whole book than that he or any other man should think that I had\r\nbehaved in a paltry spirit.” And so Lyell and Hooker took the matter in\r\nhand, and communicated to the Linnean Society, accompanied by an\r\nexplanatory statement, the two independent papers, setting forth, as\r\nthey say, “the results of the investigations of the indefatigable\r\nnaturalists, Mr. Charles Darwin and Mr. Alfred Wallace.” Such loyalty\r\nand regard to each other as Darwin and Wallace showed then and ever\r\nafter form a delightful feature in the history of this great discovery.\r\nA wonderful thing is that Hooker, now Sir Joseph Hooker, the greatest\r\nbotanist of the past century, the constant friend and comrade of Darwin,\r\nis still alive, and that Alfred Russel Wallace, too, is still with us.\r\nThey both were present when the Linnean Society celebrated the meeting\r\nof fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe views of Darwin and Wallace have now become the established doctrine\r\nof science. They have led to the universal recognition of “the origin of\r\nspecies by descent with modification.” That is a statement, in other\r\nwords, to the effect that all the various kinds of living things have\r\nbeen gradually produced by natural birth from predecessors which differ\r\nfrom them only slightly in the later stages of time, but become simpler\r\nand less like their descendants as we go further back, until we reach\r\nthe simplest living things. It has led to the conviction that there has\r\nbeen no exceptional or “miraculous” suspension of the order of Nature in\r\nthis process, but that all has come about in due and regular course, in\r\nvirtue of the properties of natural things, which we know as the laws\r\nof physics and chemistry. Most important and dominating of all these\r\nresults is the inevitable one that man himself has come from animal\r\nancestors, in the same way, and—(this is the greatest and most\r\nfar-reaching conclusion of all)—that he is still subject to those\r\nnatural processes of change and development by which he has reached his\r\npresent phase; that he must completely understand them and control them\r\n(so far as such control is possible) in order to maintain a healthy,\r\nhappy, and improving race of men on the face of the globe. This great\r\npossession—the earth and all that lives on it—is, as Lord Bacon\r\nphrased it three hundred years ago—the Kingdom of Man. Man has but to\r\nuse his intelligence in order to take control of it. The knowledge of\r\nhis own relation to it, and of the ways in which the human race is\r\naffected for good and for ill, through the operation of the self-same\r\nprocesses which affect the breeding, the improvement, the health, the\r\ndisease, the destruction, and the perfecting of other living things, has\r\nonce and for all been placed within man’s reach by the discoveries of\r\nDarwin and Wallace.\r\n\r\nBefore Darwin—that is, before 1st July 1858—the origin of the\r\ndifferent species of animals and plants was called by great thinkers\r\nlike Sir John Herschel, the astronomer, “the mystery of mysteries.” The\r\nword “species” was defined as “an animal or plant which in a state of\r\nnature is distinguished by certain peculiarities of form, size, colour,\r\nor other circumstance from any other animal or plant, and propagates\r\nafter its kind individuals perfectly resembling the parent, its\r\npeculiarities being therefore permanent.” So wrote a great naturalist in\r\nthe days before Darwin. This definition may be illustrated by two common\r\nEnglish birds—the rook and the crow. They differ from each other in\r\nslight peculiarities of form, structure, and habits, and, moreover,\r\nrooks always produce rooks, and crows always produce crows, and they do\r\nnot interbreed. Therefore it was held that all the rooks in the world\r\nhad descended from a single pair of rooks, and all the crows in like\r\nmanner from a single pair of crows, while it was considered impossible\r\nthat crows could have descended from rooks, or rooks from crows. The\r\n“origin” of the first pair of each kind was a mystery, and by many\r\npersons was held to have been due to a miraculous and sudden act of\r\n“creation.” But besides our crow and rook, there are about thirty other\r\nbirds in various parts of the world so much like our crow and rook that\r\nthey are commonly called crows, and are all regarded as “species” of the\r\ngenus crow (or _Corvus_). It was held before Darwin that all the\r\nindividuals of each of these “species” were descended from an ancestral\r\npair of crows of that species. There would have been thirty different\r\noriginal kinds, the “origin” of which was unknown, and by naturalists\r\nwas regarded as a mystery. Now, on the contrary, it is held that all the\r\nthirty living species are descended from one, not from thirty, ancestral\r\nspecies, and have been gradually modified to their present character in\r\ndifferent parts of the world; and, further, that this ancestral species\r\nwas itself derived by slow process of change and natural birth from\r\npreceding crow-like birds no longer existing.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace has said in his most readable and\r\ndelightful book, _Darwinism_—where he gives all the credit and glory to\r\nhis great fellow-worker: “Darwin wrote for a generation which had not\r\naccepted evolution—a generation which poured contempt on those who\r\nupheld the derivation of species from species by any natural law of\r\ndescent. He did his work so well that ‘descent with modification’ is now\r\nuniversally accepted as the order of nature in the organic world, and\r\nthe rising generation of naturalists can hardly realise the novelty of\r\nthis idea, or that their fathers considered it a scientific heresy to be\r\ncondemned rather than seriously discussed.”\r\n\r\nFor those who are not naturalists or men of science it is an\r\nobject-lesson of the highest importance, that the speculations and\r\nobservations which have led to the general acceptance of a new view as\r\nto the origin of the species of birds, butterflies, and flowers—in\r\nitself apparently a matter of no consequence to human life and\r\nprogress—should have necessarily led to a new epoch in philosophy, and\r\nin the higher state-craft; in fact, to the establishment of the\r\nscientific knowledge of life as the one sure guide and determining\r\nfactor of civilisation. How to breed a healthy, capable race of men, how\r\nto preserve such a race, how to educate and to train it, so that its\r\nbest qualities of mind and body may be brought to activity and\r\nperfection—this is what Darwinism can teach us, and will teach us when\r\nthe great subjects of inheritance and of variation are more fully\r\ninvestigated by the aid of public funds, and when the human mind has\r\nbeen as carefully examined and its laws as well ascertained, as are\r\nthose of the human body. There is no reason for delay; no excuse for it.\r\nFor two thousand years the learned men of Europe debated as to whether\r\nthis or that place was the site of ancient Troy, or whether there ever\r\nwas such a place at all. At last (only twenty-five years ago) a retired\r\nman of business, named Schliemann, had a “happy thought”—it was not the\r\nthought of a learned pedant, but of a scientific investigator. He said,\r\n“Let us go and see.” And at the expense of a few thousand pounds he went\r\nand found Troy and Mycenæ, and revealed—“dis-covered”—the whole\r\nmatter. That was the most tremendous and picturesque triumph of the\r\nscientific method over mere talk and pretended historical learning which\r\nhas ever been seen since human record has existed. It ought to be told\r\nto every boy and girl, for it is the greatest and most obvious proof of\r\nthe overwhelming power of the investigation of tangible things and the\r\nfutility of chatter, which has ever been seen. It is enough to inspire\r\nhope and belief in experiment even in the breast of a Member of\r\nParliament, or of a Minister of the Crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nDARWIN’S DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the public are not aware of the amount of\r\nexperiment and observation carried out by the great naturalist whose\r\nmemory was honoured by a splendid ceremony at the University of\r\nCambridge in the summer of 1909. There are, I am sure, not a few who are\r\nunder the impression that Darwin, sitting in his study or walking round\r\nhis garden, had “a happy thought,” namely, that man is only a modified\r\nand improved monkey, and proceeded to write an argumentative essay,\r\nsetting forth the conclusion that mankind are the descendants of some\r\nremote ancestral apes. Of course there is an increasing number of more\r\ncareful and inquiring men and women who take advantage of the small\r\nprice at which Mr. Darwin’s wonderful book, _The Origin of Species_, is\r\nnow to be bought, and have read that and some of his other writings, and\r\naccordingly know how far he was from being the hasty and fanciful\r\ntheorist they previously imagined him to be. It is the great distinction\r\nof Darwin that he spent more than twenty years of his life in\r\naccumulating the records of an enormous series of facts and observations\r\ntending to show that the species or “kinds” of animals and plants in\r\nnature can and do change slowly, and that there is, owing to the fact\r\nthat every pair produces a great number of offspring (sometimes many\r\nthousand), of which only a single pair, on the average, survive, a\r\nnecessary selection of those which are to survive and breed, accompanied\r\nby a rejection and destruction of the rest. This “natural selection” or\r\nsurvival of favoured varieties, he was able to show, must operate like\r\nthe selection made by breeders, fanciers, and horticulturists, and has\r\nin all probability (for in a history extending over hundreds of\r\nthousands of years we must necessarily deal with “probabilities,” and\r\nnot with direct demonstration) produced new forms, new kinds, better\r\nadapted to their surroundings than the parental forms from which they\r\nare derived.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, in order that Darwin should persuade other naturalists\r\nthat his views were correct, that he should show by putting examples “on\r\nthe table” that variations occur naturally and in great diversity;\r\nfurther, that there is great pressure in the conditions of life, and a\r\nconsequent survival of the best-suited varieties; further, that there is\r\nin reproduction a transmission of the peculiar favouring character or\r\nquality which enables a variety to survive, and thus a tendency to\r\nperpetuate the new quality. It was not enough for Darwin to “imagine”\r\nthat these things might be so, or to make the notion that they are so\r\nplausible by arguments drawn from existing knowledge. He had to do that:\r\nbut also he had to make new inquiries and discover new things about\r\nanimals and plants which fitted in with his theory and would not fit in\r\neither with the notion that all plants and animals were created—as the\r\npoet Milton supposed—out of lumps of earth and muddy water, suddenly,\r\nin the likeness of their present-day descendants, nor with some other\r\nnotions, such as that of the able and gifted French naturalist Lamarck.\r\nAnd he spent the later twenty years of his life in doing so, just as he\r\nhad spent the previous twenty years in collecting a first series of\r\nfacts and observations justifying his theory before he announced it to\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nA great difference between Lamarck and Darwin exists, not only in their\r\ntwo theories as to the mode of origin of the vast diversified series of\r\nkinds or species of plants and animals, but in their way of stating and\r\ndealing with the theory which each thought out and gave to the world.\r\nLamarck had a great knowledge of the species of plants and animals,\r\npartly through having collected specimens himself when he was an officer\r\nin the French Republican army which was employed on the Mediterranean\r\nshores of France and Italy more than a hundred years ago, and partly\r\nthrough his later official position in the great natural history museum\r\nat Paris, where large collections passed through his hands. He was a man\r\nof very keen insight and excellent method, and did more to plan out a\r\nnatural and satisfactory “classification” of animals than any one\r\nbetween his own day and that of Linnæus. His theory of the origin of\r\nspecies was essentially an opposition to the then popular view that the\r\nspecies of living things have been made by the Creator so as to fit the\r\nconditions in which they live. Lamarck contradicted this view, and said\r\nin so many words that the real fact is that the peculiar specific\r\ncharacters of animals or of plants have not been created for their\r\nconditions, but, on the contrary, that the conditions in which they live\r\nhave created the peculiarities of living things. In so far his\r\nconception was the same as Darwin’s. But Lamarck then said to himself:\r\nHow do the conditions create the peculiarities of different living\r\nthings? And he answered this question by an ingenious guess, which he\r\npublished to the world in a book called _Philosophical Zoology_, without\r\ntaking any steps to test the truth of his guess.\r\n\r\nThat is where Lamarck’s method and attitude as a scientific man is so\r\ngreatly inferior to that of Darwin. Lamarck, sitting in his study, said\r\nanimals (and plants too) must be affected by the conditions around them,\r\nso that an individual as it lives and grows becomes to a certain degree\r\nslightly changed by and adapted to those conditions. This, he said, we\r\nall see in human beings and familiar animals and plants. Now, he said,\r\nwe have only to admit that the changes so acquired are (especially when\r\nboth parents have been similarly changed) transmitted to the young in\r\nthe process of generation, and to some degree “intensified,” in order to\r\nrecognise that of necessity there is in nature a constant change and\r\nprogression of living forms, consisting in a more and more elaborate\r\n“adaptation” to the conditions of life, which will be varied and lead to\r\nnew adaptations as the living things spread over the earth or as\r\ngeological changes occur. He cited the long neck of the giraffe as an\r\nexample of what he meant. In regions where there was frequent and\r\nextensive drought, a deer-like creature would eat the lower leaves of\r\ntrees when the grass was dried up and dead. It would strain and stretch\r\nits neck in reaching after the higher leaves, and the individuals thus\r\nstraining and stretching would become an inch or two longer in the neck\r\nin consequence. These individuals would, said Lamarck, transmit their\r\nincreased length of neck to their offspring, who again would strain and\r\nstretch after higher leaves, and get a further increase of neck-length,\r\nand so it would go on, little by little, over many thousand generations,\r\nuntil the neck-stretchers had become well marked and distinguished by\r\ntheir long necks from such of their ancestral stock as survived in other\r\nregions where, the grass being good, there was no inducement to\r\nstraining and stretching the neck.\r\n\r\nNow the great difference between Lamarck and Darwin is that Lamarck was\r\nquite content to state the ingenious supposition illustrated by the\r\nimaginary history of the giraffe, and to declare that this was the law\r\nof Nature and is actually going on every day, without, so to speak,\r\ngetting out of his chair. He never attempted to show by observation or\r\nexperiment that such a change of form as the stretching of the neck by\r\nstraining after food could and did occur, or that if it did that it\r\ncould be transmitted by a parent or couple of parents to their\r\noffspring. And consequently for many years no one attached much value to\r\nLamarck’s notions on the subject. When, fifty years later, Darwin’s very\r\ndifferent theory became widely received, based on the demonstrable fact\r\nthat congenital variations (not stretchings and warpings acquired in the\r\nlifetime of a parent, but variations which are inborn, and occur in some\r\nbut not other individuals living under one and the same set of\r\nconditions) are transmitted to offspring, and that those among these\r\nvariations which are favourable to success in life will enable their\r\npossessor to survive and to produce young inheriting those favourable\r\nvariations—then it occurred to those naturalists who were inclined to\r\nbelieve in Lamarck’s suggestion to inquire into the solid facts in\r\nregard to that also, and to see whether his bare statement was true.\r\nFrom that day to this, it has never been shown that it is true. It is,\r\nindeed, to begin with, a rare thing to find instances of either wild\r\nanimals or wild plants which, growing up in unusual conditions, have\r\ntheir structure altered and “adapted” so as to be more serviceable in\r\nthose unusual conditions than their usual structure would be; and in\r\nthose cases where such adaptive alterations have been produced, every\r\nexperimenter is agreed in stating that he has found that when (even\r\nafter several generations in the changed conditions) the young are\r\nrestored to their original conditions, they simply grow up into the\r\noriginal forms: no permanent change in the stock or race has been\r\neffected. Every attempt to show by experiment that a new character can\r\nbe acquired by the stock in this way, and show itself by heredity\r\nalone—when the modifying adapting conditions are removed—has\r\ncompletely failed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Darwin himself and his followers have made almost\r\nendless experiments and observations on plants and animals, establishing\r\nfacts as to structure and the relation of special kinds of living things\r\nto their surroundings which can only be explained on the supposition\r\nthat Darwin’s theory is true in detail; that is to say, not merely that\r\nthe kinds of animals and plants have arisen from previous kinds by\r\nnatural descent—that supposition is much older than either Darwin or\r\nLamarck—but that the method by which the transformation has been\r\nbrought about is (_a_) the occurrence in every generation of every\r\nanimal and plant of minute variations in every, or nearly every, part,\r\nand (_b_) the continual selection in the severe struggle for existence\r\nof those individuals to grow to maturity and reproduce, which happen to\r\npresent favourable variations, which variations are accordingly\r\ntransmitted to the next generation, and may be intensified, so far as\r\nintensification is of value, in each succeeding generation.\r\n\r\nA book full of observations and reflections about the structure, habits,\r\nand mode of occurrence and geography of a great number of plants and\r\nanimals is Darwin’s _Journal of Researches_, published in 1845, and now\r\nrepublished as _A Naturalist’s Voyage_. In order to know very minutely\r\nthe differences and resemblances between all the kinds or species of one\r\ngroup of living things Darwin studied for eight years the “cirrhipedes,”\r\nthe name given to the sea-acorns and ships’ barnacles which occur in all\r\nparts of the world, some living on rocks, some on the backs of turtles,\r\nothers on whales, on the feet of birds, on bits of floating wood or of\r\npumice-stone, and some on one another! They are all hermaphrodites, but\r\nDarwin found in several a most singular thing, namely, the existence of\r\nminute males, complemental to and parasitic on the hermaphrodites. His\r\ndiscovery was doubted and denied, but he had the pleasure of seeing it\r\nat last fully confirmed thirty years after his book on cirrhipedes was\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nDarwin discovered that the presence of the same species of plants and of\r\nsome few animals on distant mountain summits and in the Arctic region is\r\ndue to the former extension of ice between these situations during the\r\nlast glacial period. He was, before everything else and by necessity for\r\nthe examination of his theory, a geologist, and wrote many valuable\r\ngeological memoirs. The history of the origin of the species of living\r\nthings consists largely in tracing them to extinct creatures, and in\r\nshowing what were the possible migrations and what the conditions of\r\nland and water, temperature and vegetation, in past periods, and in\r\nregard to given areas of the globe. The book on the _Fertilisation of\r\nOrchids_ was the first published by Darwin after the _Origin of\r\nSpecies_. In it he showed how the marvellous shapes and colours and\r\nmechanisms of the flowers of orchids are adapted to ensure\r\ncross-fertilisation by insects, and how they can be explained as\r\noriginating by the natural selection of variations—if the value of\r\ncross-fertilisation is once recognised. The explanation of the reason\r\nfor the existence of two kinds of primrose flowers—the short-styled and\r\nthe long-styled—clearly arrived at by him as being a mechanism to\r\nsecure cross-fertilisation, delighted him in 1862, and led him to\r\ndiscover the same sort of modification in other flowers. Then, in 1864,\r\nhe published his researches on _Climbing Plants_, and later a book on\r\nthe _Movements of Plants_, in which he discovered the mechanism and the\r\nwonderful variety of movements of plants, and showed their value to the\r\nplant, and consequent origin, by natural selection.\r\n\r\nHe especially loved to discover evidence that plants can do many things\r\nwhich had been thought to be only within the powers of the other section\r\nof living things—the animals; and finding during one summer holiday\r\nthat the beautiful little sun-dew moves its red-knobbed tentacles so as\r\nto entrap minute insects, he discovered the whole history of\r\n_Insectivorous Plants_, and showed that there are many plants of various\r\ngroups which catch insects and digest them in a sort of stomach, as an\r\nanimal might do. Thus the water-holding pitchers of the pitcher-plants\r\nof tropical forests were explained as being food-catchers and digesters\r\nof great value to the nutrition of the plant, and their gradual\r\nformation by variation and natural selection rendered comprehensible.\r\n\r\nHis greatest book next to the _Origin_—containing an immense quantity\r\nof original notes and observations and valuable information from all\r\nkinds of breeders and fanciers—is the _Variation of Animals and Plants\r\nunder Domestication_ (1868). The facts recorded are discussed in the\r\nlight of the great theory, and honest, fair-minded consideration is\r\ngiven to those which present difficulties as well as to those which\r\nclearly favour it. In 1871 came the _Descent of Man_, followed in 1872\r\nby the _Expression of the Emotions in Men and Animals_—in which, again,\r\nit was shown that the facts as to the likeness between man and apes can\r\nbe explained on the theory that natural selection and survival of\r\nfavourable variations have been at work, and that the facts are\r\nhopelessly without meaning or explanation on any other hypothesis. His\r\nlast published book was on _The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the\r\nAction of Worms_, in which he not only showed what an important part\r\nearthworms play in burying stones and rocks, and in fitting the ground\r\nfor the growth of plants, but recorded some discoveries as to the senses\r\nof worms and as to their treatment of leaves by a digestive fluid exuded\r\nfrom the mouth so as to soften a leaf before swallowing it.\r\n\r\nEvery one of Darwin’s books abounds with new facts and new points of\r\nview disclosed by the application to first one thing and then another of\r\nhis vivifying discovery-causing theory of natural selection. The\r\nsubsidiary theory of the selection of brilliantly coloured males by\r\nfemales in pairing, as a cause of the brilliant colours and patterns of\r\nmany birds and insects, is developed in his _Descent of Man_. It led him\r\nto many important discoveries and observations as to the colouring and\r\nornamentation of animals, and when considered, together with Wallace’s\r\nand Bates’s theory of mimicry and of the warning and protective\r\ncolourings of insects, goes far to explain all the specific colouring of\r\nanimals and plants as due to natural selection and survival. A theory\r\nwhich has produced such prodigious results in the way of “explaining”\r\nall forms, colours, habits, and occurrences of living things—as has\r\nthat of Charles Darwin—simply holds the field against all comers. When\r\nLamarck’s theory has been shown to be consistent with the most\r\nelementary facts as to heredity, and further to afford a rational\r\nexplanation of any group of biological facts, it will be time to\r\nconsider how far it may be entertained in conjunction with Darwin’s\r\ntheory—but not until then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nDARWIN’S THEORY UNSHAKEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems ill-mannered, if not ill-natured, that the year of the\r\ncentenary of Charles Darwin’s birth should have been chosen by owners of\r\nanonymous pens in order to alarm the public mind with the preposterous\r\nstatement that his celebrated and universally accepted theory of the\r\norigin of the species or kinds of plants and animals by natural\r\nselection, or “the survival of favoured races in the struggle for life,”\r\nis undermined and discredited. Such a statement once coolly made in the\r\npublic Press is necessarily believed by a large number of uninformed\r\nreaders, and, like all calumny, is none the less relished by the\r\nfoolish, and, for the moment, none the less harmful, because it is\r\nbaseless.\r\n\r\nThose who seek to belittle Darwin’s theory show, whenever they venture\r\nto enter into particulars, that they do not know what Darwin’s theory\r\nis. They confuse it with other theories, and even imagine that some\r\nenthusiastic Darwinians who have tried to add a chapter here or there to\r\nDarwin’s doctrine, are opponents of the great theory. Let me briefly\r\nstate what that theory is:\r\n\r\nIt rests on three groups of facts—matters of observation, which are not\r\ntheory or guess work at all—but admitted by every one and demonstrated\r\nevery day. These are—(1) Living things, each in its kind, produce a\r\nfar larger number of young than can possibly grow up to maturity, since\r\nthe kind of food and the situation necessary to each kind are limited\r\nand already occupied. Only one oyster embryo out of every five million\r\nproduced (the reader may refer to p. 137 on this subject) grows up\r\nthrough all the successive stages of youth to the adult state. The total\r\nnumber of a species of animal or plant on the whole area where it is\r\nfound does not increase. Even in those which produce a small number of\r\nyoung, there is great destruction, and taking all the individuals into\r\nconsideration, only a single pair of young arrive at maturity to replace\r\ntheir parents. There is no exception to the rule that every organic\r\nbeing naturally multiplies at so high a rate that, if not destroyed, the\r\nprogeny of a single pair would soon cover the earth. The elephant is\r\nreckoned the slowest breeder of known animals; it commences to breed at\r\n30 years of age, dies at 100, and has six young in the interval. After\r\n750 years, supposing all the offspring of a single pair fulfilled the\r\nrule and were not destroyed in an untimely way, there would be nearly\r\nnineteen million elephants alive descended from the first pair. There is\r\nthen no doubt as to the enormous excess in the production of young\r\nliving things, nor as to their necessary competition with one another of\r\nthe most severe and inexorable kind; nor again as to the necessary\r\ndeath, in many species, of hundreds and thousands, for every one which\r\nsurvives to maturity and in its turn breeds.\r\n\r\n(2) The second great fact is that among all the young born to a pair of\r\nparents, no two are exactly alike, nor are any exactly like their\r\nparents; nor are any two taken from all produced by all parents of that\r\nspecies exactly alike. They all resemble their parents at the\r\ncorresponding age, in a general way and even very closely; but the\r\nresemblance is far from amounting to identity. This is called\r\n“variation.” It is familiar to us all in the case of the organism which\r\nwe know best, and observe most closely, namely, man. It is also a matter\r\nof common observation in the case of dogs, cats, horses, and other\r\ndomesticated animals. Many of these “variations” are exhibited in points\r\nof size, proportion, and colour, which are easily noted at once by the\r\neye. But “variation” is really a deep-seated thing, and depends on\r\ncauses which lie below the surface. We know that the offspring of men\r\nand of animals and of plants, give evidence of variations in what we\r\ncall constitution, tendency, temperament, aptitude, strength, and that\r\nthe colour, and even size of this or that part, are really only\r\nindications of a deep-seated difference in the living chemistry, the\r\nforces of nutrition and growth which reside in the living substance. The\r\nfact that many thousands of a species may be born and only a few\r\nsurvive, means therefore that many thousand varieties, often varieties\r\nnot readily measured by the eye, are produced in each generation, from\r\nwhich a few individuals are in some way “selected” for survival.\r\n\r\n(3) The third great fact is that though there is variation, amongst all\r\nthe offspring in each generation, there is also a continual and definite\r\ninheritance by offspring of the qualities and structure of their parents\r\nto a degree which altogether preponderates over the variations. To put\r\nit in another way, we all know that every parental organism transmits to\r\nits young not only the qualities and structure of the species, or of the\r\nrace, or of the family, but also transmits its own peculiarities or\r\nvariations in which it departed from its parents, and from its brothers\r\nand sisters. This is best illustrated by our daily experience of human\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nThese facts being admitted, and abundantly illustrated and traced in\r\ndetail by years of observation and experimental breeding in all kinds\r\nof living things by hundreds of careful observers who have published the\r\nrecords of their studies, we come to the step where Darwin makes use of\r\nsupposition or hypothesis. The question is, “Does the one which, out of\r\nthe thousands of slightly different varieties, survives—do so by\r\nhaphazard? or is there a necessarily acting state of things which\r\nselects that one special variety for survival?” Gardeners and breeders\r\nof pigeons, dogs, and cattle deliberately select the variations which\r\nthey desire, breed from them, and so carry on by inheritance the special\r\nvariation—whilst they ruthlessly destroy or restrain from breeding the\r\nnumerous other variations in their “stock” which they do not desire.\r\n“If,” said Darwin, “there is any necessarily selective mechanism in\r\nNature which could act as the breeder does, new varieties might be\r\n‘naturally’ selected, and changes of form and appearance naturally\r\nestablished, which in the course of long ages would amount to such\r\nmarked differences as separate what we call one species from another.”\r\nHe showed that there is a natural mechanism of the required kind.\r\n“Since,” he says, “the competition among the members of any one kind or\r\nspecies for a place in life is so very severe, and the hostile\r\ncircumstances so varied, and since all the competing offspring differ by\r\n‘variation’ ever so little from one another, those varieties which are\r\nbetter suited in even the smallest degree to hold their own not merely\r\nin fighting with the others, but in withstanding injurious influences,\r\nin escaping enemies, and in procuring food, will be the ones which will\r\nsurvive, when a large number of cases, many thousands, extending over a\r\nlarge area and many years, are considered. Those which are ‘best fitted’\r\nto get through the exceedingly numerous dangers and difficulties of life\r\nwill be the survivors.” Hence we get the survival of the fit—the fit\r\nvariations—by natural selection in the struggle for life. This, it\r\nwill be observed, is an inference, and not a direct observation.\r\n\r\nSo long as the conditions remain practically or effectively unchanged,\r\nthe animal or plant already “fitted” to them will be succeeded by those\r\nof its offspring which most resemble it in the essential points of\r\n“fitness.” But we know that in the course of ages, more or less rapidly,\r\nclimates change, land emerges from the sea, islands join continents,\r\ncontinents become scattered islands, animals and plants migrate into\r\nregions previously uninhabited by them. As such changes gradually come\r\non, the natural selection of favoured varieties will necessarily lead to\r\nthe survival of others than those previously favoured, other variations\r\nbetter suited to the new conditions will survive.\r\n\r\nThe natural selection of favoured variations would not amount to much,\r\nwere the variations not perpetuated by transmission to the young which\r\nthey produce. This, it is common knowledge [see (3)], does take place.\r\nIt is known also that a variation so established is as a result of the\r\nregular process of variation presented in larger volume or emphasised in\r\ncharacter in some individuals of subsequent generations, and by\r\ncontinued “natural selection” it may become more and more a prominent or\r\ndominant feature of the race.\r\n\r\nSo far, the only assumption made by Mr. Darwin is that any or some of\r\nthe endless variations which occur in all the offspring of wild plants\r\nand animals, in various combinations and degree in each individual, can\r\nbe sufficiently important to determine the survival or non-survival of\r\nthe organisms possessing them. That is a matter which has been largely\r\nstudied and discussed. The verdict of those who have studied on the spot\r\n(as Darwin himself did) the teeming life of the tropics, the insects,\r\nbirds, and plants of those regions, is that we are justified in\r\nconsidering that small variations are sufficiently important to turn\r\nthe scale in favour of survival or non-survival. It is not easy for a\r\nman who is not a determined naturalist, constantly observing the ways of\r\nwild living things, to appreciate the evidence as to the efficacy of\r\nsmall variations, even were I able here to submit it to him. It is to be\r\nfound in the published works of an army of investigators. In any case it\r\nis granted that effective variations—whether small or great—occur in\r\nnature, and that natural selection favours and perpetuates the new and\r\nfitter variety to the exclusion of the less fit.\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty to most people comes in the supposition next made by\r\nMr. Darwin—namely, that this slow process of change by natural\r\nselection of favoured variations and their transmission and perpetuation\r\nby inheritance is sufficient to effect by its continued operation\r\nthrough enormous ages of time the conversion of a race of ancestral\r\nthree-toed zebras into the one-toed horse of to-day; before that, of\r\nfive-toed beasts into three-toed; at an earlier stage of fishlike\r\ncreatures into four-footed land animals, and so on. You have to picture\r\nthe whole series of animals and of plants which are now or ever have\r\nbeen, as two gigantic family trees or pedigrees, meeting in common\r\nancestors of the simplest grade of microscopic life. All the diverging\r\nbranches and twigs of these great “family trees” have been determined by\r\nthe adaptation of living form to the endlessly varied conditions of life\r\non this planet, by the natural selection or survival of variations and\r\nthe transmission and accumulation of those variations from parent to\r\noffspring. This is a tremendous demand on the imagination. It is,\r\nhowever, not a difficult one to concede, when one is acquainted with the\r\nfacts and conclusions of geology. The history of the crust of the earth\r\nwas explained twenty years before the date of Darwin’s theory by Charles\r\nLyell as due to the continued action through immense periods of time of\r\nthe same natural forces which are now at work. And, moreover, the\r\nexamination of the successive stratified deposits of the earth’s crust\r\nhas yielded the remains of whole series of animals and of plants\r\n(simpler in character the older and deeper the rock in which they\r\noccur), which can be satisfactorily explained and interpreted as the\r\nancestral forms from which present organisms have been developed.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the natural selection of variations as the moving spring\r\nin the gradual development of living forms from simplest living matter\r\nis Darwin’s theory. It is not possible to find any naturalist of\r\nconsideration who does not accept it. There are various views held and\r\ndiscussed as to the cause of variation, as to the importance of small\r\nand of big variations, as to the non-transmissibility of some kinds of\r\nvariation, and as to various peculiarities in regard to inheritance.\r\nThey do not for the most part touch the main features of Mr. Darwin’s\r\ntheory. No doubt we are learning and shall learn more about the facts of\r\nvariation and the details of the process of hereditary transmission, but\r\nsuch increase of knowledge has not tended to undermine Mr. Darwin’s\r\ntheory, and does not seem at all likely to do so.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the celebration at Cambridge in 1909 of the centenary\r\nof Darwin’s birth, I was invited by the Vice-Chancellor, on behalf of\r\nthe University, to deliver in the Senate-house an address, others being\r\ngiven by representatives of the United States (Prof. Osborne), of\r\nGermany (Prof. Hertwig), and of Russia (Prof. Metchnikoff). The\r\nfollowing is the text of that address:—\r\n\r\n“I feel it a great honour to be called upon to speak here to-day, and to\r\nstand, on behalf of the naturalists of the British Empire, by the side\r\nof the distinguished men whose orations you have just heard.\r\n\r\n“I think that the one thing about Charles Darwin which the large\r\nmajority of British naturalists would wish to be to-day proclaimed, in\r\nthe first place—with no doubtful or qualifying phrase—is that, in\r\ntheir judgment, after these fifty years of examination and testing, his\r\n‘theory of the origin of species by means of natural selection or the\r\npreservation of favoured races in the struggle for life’ remains whole\r\nand sound and convincing, in spite of every attempt to upset it.\r\n\r\n“I am not stating more than the simple truth when I say that, in the\r\njudgment of those who are best acquainted with living things in their\r\nactual living surroundings, ‘natural selection’ retains the position\r\nwhich Mr. Darwin claimed for it of being the main means of the\r\nmodification of organic forms.\r\n\r\n“Our admiration for the vast series of beautiful observations and\r\ninteresting inquiries carried out by Darwin during his long life must\r\nnot lead us to forget that they were devised by him in order to test the\r\ntruth of his theory and to meet objections to it, and that they were\r\ntriumphantly successful. They, together with the work of Alfred Russel\r\nWallace and many of their followers, have more and more firmly\r\nestablished Darwin’s theory. On the other hand, no attempt to amend that\r\ntheory in any essential particular has been successful.\r\n\r\n“The nature of organic variation and of the character of the variations\r\nupon which natural selection can and does act was not, as we are\r\nsometimes asked to believe, neglected or misapprehended by Darwin. The\r\nnotion that these variations are large and sudden was considered by him,\r\nand for reasons set forth by him at considerable length rejected. That\r\nnotion has in recent years been resuscitated, but its truth has not been\r\nrendered probable by evidence either of such an accurate character or of\r\nsuch pertinence as would justify the rejection of Darwin’s fundamental\r\nconception of the importance of minute and ubiquitous variations.\r\n\r\n“Further, in regard to the important facts of heredity connected with\r\nthe cross-breeding of cultivated varieties, especially in regard to the\r\nblending or non-blending of their characters in their offspring and as\r\nto prepotency, it seems to me important that we should now and here call\r\nto mind the full and careful consideration given to this subject by\r\nDarwin. We cannot doubt that he would have been deeply interested in the\r\nnumerical and statistical results associated with the name of Mendel.\r\nThose results tend to throw light on the mechanisms concerned in\r\nhereditary transmission, but it cannot be shown that they are opposed in\r\nany way to the truth of Darwin’s great theoretical structure—his\r\ndoctrine of the origin of species.\r\n\r\n“It has often been urged against Darwin that he did not explain the\r\norigin of variation, and especially that he has not shown how variations\r\nof sufficient moment to be selected for preservation in the struggle for\r\nexistence have in the first place originated. The brief reply to the\r\nfirst objection is that variation is a common attribute of many natural\r\nsubstances of which living matter is only one. In regard to the second\r\npoint, I desire to remind this assembly that Darwin described with\r\nspecial emphasis instances of what he calls ‘correlated variability.’ In\r\nmy opinion he has thus furnished the key to the explanation of what are\r\ncalled useless specific characters and of incipient organs. That key\r\nconsists in the fact that a general physiological property or character\r\nof utility is often selected and perpetuated, which carries with it\r\ndistinct, even remote, correlated growths and peculiarities obvious to\r\nour eyes, yet having no functional value. At a later stage in the\r\nhistory of such a form these correlated growths may acquire value and\r\nbecome the subject of selection.\r\n\r\n“It is thus, as it seems to me, and as, I believe, to the great body of\r\nmy brother naturalists, that Darwin’s theory stands after fifty years of\r\ntrial and application.\r\n\r\n“The greatness of Charles Darwin’s work is, and will be for ever, one of\r\nthe glories of the University of Cambridge. It is fitting on the present\r\noccasion that one who speaks on behalf of English men of science should\r\ncall to mind the nature of his connection with this great University and\r\nthe peculiarly English features of his life-story and of that fine\r\ncharacter which endears his memory to all of us as much as his genius\r\nexcites our admiration and reverence. Darwin was not, like so many a\r\ndistinguished son of Cambridge, a scholar or a fellow of his college,\r\nnor a professor of the University. His connection with the University\r\nand the influence which it had upon his life belong to a tradition and a\r\nsystem which have survived longer in our old English universities than\r\nin those of other lands. Darwin entered the University, not seeking a\r\nspecial course of study with the view of professional training, nor\r\naiming at success in competitive examinations for honours and emolument.\r\nHe came to Cambridge intending to become a clergyman, but blessed with\r\nsufficient means and leisure to enable him to pursue his own devices, to\r\ncollect beetles, to explore the fen country, and to cultivate his love\r\nof nature. It was thus that he became acquainted with that rare spirit\r\nHenslow, the Cambridge professor of botany, and it is through Henslow\r\nand the influence of his splendid abilities and high personal character\r\nupon Darwin that Cambridge acquired the right to claim the author of the\r\n‘Origin of Species’ as a product of her beneficence and activity as a\r\nseat of learning.\r\n\r\n“As an Oxford man and a member of Exeter College, I may remind this\r\nassembly that in precisely the same way Darwin’s dearest friend and\r\nelder brother in science, Charles Lyell, had a few years earlier\r\nentered at Exeter College, and by happy chance fallen under the\r\ninfluence of the enthusiastic Buckland, the University reader in geology\r\nand a Canon of Christ Church. The wise freedom of study permitted and\r\nprovided for in those long-passed days by Oxford and Cambridge is what\r\nhas given the right to claim the discovery, if not the making, of Lyell\r\nto the one and of Darwin to the other.\r\n\r\n“Darwin’s love of living nature and of the country life are especially\r\nEnglish characteristics; so, too, I venture to think, are the\r\nunflinching determination and simple courage—I may even say the\r\naudacity—with which he acquired, after he had left the University, the\r\nwide range of detailed knowledge in various branches of science which he\r\nfound necessary in order to deal with the problem of the origin of the\r\nspecies of plants and animals, the investigation of which became his\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n“The unselfish generosity and delicacy of feeling which marked Darwin’s\r\nrelations with a younger naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, are known to\r\nall. I cannot let this occasion pass without citing those words of his\r\nwhich tell us most clearly what manner of man he was and add to his\r\nsplendid achievements as an intellectual force—a light and a beauty of\r\nwhich every Englishman must be proud. When in old age he surveyed his\r\nlife’s work he wrote:—‘I believe that I have acted rightly in steadily\r\nfollowing and devoting my life to science.’\r\n\r\n“To have desired to act ‘rightly,’ and to be able to think of success in\r\nlife as measured by the fulfilment of that desire, is the indication and\r\nwarrant of true greatness of character. We Englishmen have ever loved to\r\nrecognise this noble kind of devotion in our national heroes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMETCHNIKOFF AND TOLSTOI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Darwin celebration at Cambridge, in June 1909, brought a wonderful\r\nassemblage of celebrated biologists from all parts of the world to this\r\ncountry. There never has been seen such a company of great discoverers\r\nof all nationalities in the field of natural history and the science of\r\nliving things, as were present in the University of Cambridge during\r\nthat week. Even philosophers, moralists, and jurists were present to\r\njoin with the one great political leader of our own country who really\r\nknows and appreciates the importance of the scientific study of\r\nNature—the Right Hon. Arthur J. Balfour—in his fervent and heartfelt\r\ntribute to the influence of Darwin’s work and theory in all departments\r\nof human knowledge, thought, and activity. One of the most remarkable\r\nmen present was Elie Metchnikoff. He represented both Russia, the\r\ncountry of his birth and earlier scientific work, and his adopted\r\ncountry, France, where, as sub-director of the Institut Pasteur, his\r\nlater and most important researches have been carried on. Russia was\r\nalso represented by Salensky, late director of the Museum of St.\r\nPetersburg, well known to us all as a discoverer in the embryology\r\n(growth from the egg) of marine animals, and by Timiriazeff, the\r\nbotanist, renowned for his work on the mode in which leaf-green or\r\n“chlorophyll” enables green plants to obtain their food from the gases\r\nof the atmosphere. France had other representatives in Edmond Perrier,\r\ndirector of the Paris Museum, and Prince Roland Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nMetchnikoff was one of the four representatives selected by the\r\nUniversity to deliver orations in the Senate House in honour of Darwin.\r\nHe especially drew attention to the influence of Darwin’s theory on the\r\nstudy of disease. The recognition of the derivation of man from animal\r\nancestors, and of the complete community of the structure and the\r\nchemical activity of the organs of man with those of the organs of\r\nanimals, had made (he said) the study of the diseases of animals a\r\nnecessary feature in the understanding of the diseases of man. The\r\nfar-reaching principle of Darwin that the mechanisms and processes\r\nobserved in the bodies of plants and of animals (including man) must\r\nhave been selected in the struggle for existence and perpetuated,\r\nbecause of their utility, led Metchnikoff to inquire what is the value\r\nor use of the process called inflammation and of the “eating\r\ncorpuscles,” or “phagocytes” (so named by him), which wander from the\r\nblood into inflamed tissues. This question had led him to the discovery\r\nthat the phagocytes engulf and destroy disease-germs, and are the great\r\nprotectors of the animal and human body against bacteria and other germs\r\nwhich enter cut and wounded surfaces, and would start disease were there\r\nnot “inflammation,” which is nothing more nor less than a\r\nnerve-regulated stagnation of the circulation of the blood at the\r\nwounded spot, and the consequent arrival at this spot of thousands of\r\n“phagocytes,” which pass out of the stagnant blood through the walls of\r\nthe fine blood-vessels. These armies of phagocytes proceed to eat up and\r\ndestroy all the germs which fall on to the wound—from the air, from\r\ndirty surfaces, and from the skin. The utility of inflammation and its\r\ngradual development, according to Darwinian principles, in the animal\r\nseries, was shown twenty years ago by Metchnikoff. His important work on\r\n“immunity” and on infection and on protection against germ-caused\r\ndisease is thus seen to be one of the many flourishing and valuable\r\nbranches of knowledge which have originated from Darwin’s great\r\nconception and his example in experiment and inquiry.\r\n\r\nMetchnikoff is now devoting all his attention to the possibility of\r\nprolonging human life. The facts seem to show that if we ate and drank\r\nonly what is best for us, and led lives regulated by reason and\r\nknowledge, we should, nearly all, attain to 80 or even 100 years of age,\r\nhaving healthy minds and healthy bodies. We should die quietly and\r\ncomfortably at the end, with much the same feeling of contentment in\r\nwell-earned final repose as that which we now experience in going to\r\nsleep at the end of a long and happy day of healthy exercise and\r\nactivity. Metchnikoff thinks that the causes of too early death may be\r\nascertained, and when ascertained avoided or removed. In 1870, in a\r\nlittle book on _Comparative Longevity_, I distinguished what we may call\r\nthe “possible life,” or “potential longevity,” of any given human being\r\nfrom his or her “expectation” of life. Potential longevity has been well\r\ncalled our “lease” of life. It is probably not very different in\r\ndifferent races of men or individuals, and is probably higher than King\r\nDavid thought, being 100 to 120 years, and not merely 70 years. We all,\r\nor nearly all, fail to last out our “lease” owing to accidents,\r\nviolence, and avoidable, as well as unavoidable, disease; so that 70\r\nyears is named as our tenure when the injury done to us by unhealthy\r\nmodes of life and by actual disease are considered as inevitable.\r\nMetchnikoff proposes to discover and to avoid those conditions which\r\n“wear down” most of us and produce “senility” and “death” before we\r\nhave really run out our lease of life.\r\n\r\nHuman beings die most abundantly in the earliest years of life.\r\nStatistics show that at birth the chance or expectation of life is only\r\n45 years, whilst at 10 years old you may expect to live to be 61. At 30\r\nyou have not a much better chance—you will probably, if you are what is\r\ncalled a “healthy” life, die when you are 65. But if you survive to be\r\n50 you may expect, if you have not any obvious disease or signs of\r\n“break up,” another twenty years, and will probably die at 70; surviving\r\nto 60, you may expect, if you are what passes for “healthy,” to live to\r\n73. Now, it is especially with regard to life after 40 or 50 years of\r\nage that Metchnikoff is interested. Those who have survived the special\r\ndangers and difficulties of youth, and have arrived at this mature age,\r\nought to be able to realise much more frequently than they do something\r\nlike the full “lease of life.” There seems to be no reason why they\r\nshould not avoid the usual rapid “senile changes” or weakness of old\r\nage, and survive, as a few actually do, to something like 100. The\r\ncauses of “senile change” and the way to defeat their operation are what\r\nMetchnikoff is studying. Hardening of the walls of the arteries set up\r\nby certain avoidable diseases contracted in earlier life, and by the use\r\nof alcohol (not only to the degree which we call “drunkenness,” but to\r\nsuch a degree as to make one depend on it as a “pick-me-up”), is an\r\nundoubted cause of that weakness and liability to succumb to other\r\ndiseases which is so general after 50 years of age. The causes which\r\nproduce hardened arteries can be avoided. Another cause of senile\r\nchanges is declared by Metchnikoff, to arise from the continual\r\nabsorption of poisonous substances produced by the decomposition of\r\npartially digested food in the lower bowel or large intestine. This is\r\nat present the chief subject of his study. It is to prevent the\r\nformation of these poisons that he has introduced the use of sour milk,\r\nprepared with the lactic ferment. Since the Cambridge celebration he has\r\nbeen in London in order to examine the condition of certain patients\r\nfrom whom a distinguished English surgeon has found it necessary to\r\nremove the “large intestine.” Metchnikoff wishes to ascertain what\r\nbacteria, poison-producing or other, are present in these patients, and\r\nwhat is their general chemical condition now that this poison-producing\r\npart of the digestive canal has been taken from them.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, Metchnikoff has some very interesting experiments in progress\r\nwith bats. He uses the large tropical fruit-eating bats, or “flying\r\nfoxes.” They have a very short intestine, and very few bacteria and of\r\nvery few kinds are to be found in its contents. On the other hand, there\r\nare as many as thirty distinct kinds of bacteria producing putrefaction\r\nor other chemical change in the digestive canal of man—and their\r\nquantity is gigantic. They pervade the whole contents of the human\r\ndigestive canal by millions. By properly feeding the flying foxes in his\r\nlaboratory in Paris Metchnikoff has actually succeeded in getting rid of\r\nall bacteria from their digestive canal, so that he now has adult\r\nmammalian animals, not very remote from man in their structure, food,\r\nand internal chemistry, which are absolutely free from the intestinal\r\nparasitic bacteria which he supposes to cause poisoning and senile\r\nchanges in man. It is obvious, without pursuing the matter into further\r\ndetail here, that Metchnikoff is now in a position to test his views as\r\nto the action of particular kinds of bacteria—he has animals which are\r\nfree from them. He can make an experiment, keeping some of his bats\r\nstill free from bacteria and causing some to be largely infected by this\r\nor that kind, and he can compare the result in regard to the health and\r\nchemical condition of the animals. So, too, the patients from whom the\r\nlower intestine has been removed may very probably furnish him (through\r\nhis assistant who remains in London) with important facts for comparison\r\nwith the condition of persons who have not been deprived of this part of\r\nthe digestive apparatus.\r\n\r\nI have given this sketch of what my friend is doing in order to furnish\r\nsome notion of the kind of investigation which he pursues. He does not\r\nexpect to extend the “lease” of human life, but by ascertaining in a\r\ndefinite scientific way the true rules of internal and external\r\n“hygiene” he does hope to give mankind an increased “expectation” of\r\nlife; in fact, to enable a vastly larger number of men and women to\r\nenjoy that lease to the full, and to die without disappointment and\r\nregret, even with contentment and pleasure, at the end of it.\r\n\r\nMetchnikoff was in Russia in the spring of 1909, and spent a day with\r\nTolstoi. They were “fêted” and photographed together, the greatest\r\nartist and the greatest scientist of Russia. Tolstoi is 81 years of age.\r\nHe took Metchnikoff out alone for a drive in his pony-cart so as to talk\r\nwith him without interruption. “What do you think of life?” was the\r\nfirst question he asked, and one which it took my friend some time to\r\nanswer. In regard to vegetarianism the two great men did not agree. When\r\nMetchnikoff declared that there was less cruelty on man’s part in\r\nkilling wild animals to eat them than in leaving them to die by the\r\ntooth and claw of predaceous animals or from starvation, Tolstoi\r\nobserved that that was argument and reason, and that he paid no\r\nattention to them; he only guided himself (he said) by sentiment, which\r\nhe felt sure told him what was good and right! He was, however, deeply\r\ninterested in an account of the cannibalism of savage races of men,\r\nconcerning which he seemed to be quite uninformed. He also was\r\nprofoundly interested in Metchnikoff’s view that Goethe, in the second\r\npart of _Faust_, is chiefly bent upon depicting the persistence of the\r\namorous passion in old age—of which Goethe himself was an example—and\r\nTolstoi declared that this gave a new meaning to the poem, which he had\r\nalways hitherto found dull and unintelligible. But when Metchnikoff\r\ndescribed in glowing words the joy and even rapture with which man will\r\nhereafter welcome the repose and mystery of death, having completed a\r\nlong and healthy life of some hundred years, Tolstoi declared that this\r\nwas indeed a fine conception, although it was entirely subversive of his\r\nown notions as to the significance of life and death. Tolstoi also\r\nstated that he had written his stories rapidly and without effort, but\r\nthat his essays on morality and religion had cost him great labour; and,\r\nfurther, that he could not now remember the former, though the latter\r\nstill were developing and incessantly occupied his thought.\r\n\r\nIt was admitted with regret by Darwin that he ceased in middle age to\r\ncare for poetry and art, though there seems to be no doubt that he\r\nmistook fatigue and preoccupation of mind for a real change in taste and\r\npower of appreciation. It is interesting to place beside this the case\r\nof the great literary artist, Tolstoi, who not only frankly confesses\r\nthat he refuses to be guided by reason and follows sentiment, but is\r\nalso profoundly ignorant upon all the most ordinary topics of human life\r\noutside his own village, and of all Nature and her workings. Would\r\nTolstoi have been a greater or a smaller artist if he had had a larger\r\nknowledge of the things that are? Was Darwin’s great scientific\r\nachievement really related to an innate indifference to what is called\r\n“poetry”? I will not now discuss the matter, but I am convinced that so\r\nfar as natural gift is concerned, the keenest scientific capacity is not\r\nonly compatible with the fullest sensibility to art and with the power\r\nof poetical vision and expression, but is often accompanied by them;\r\nand, further, that the work of an artist, if he is a great artist,\r\ncannot be hampered by knowledge. It is only the small talent or the\r\nfeeble genius that can be paralysed rather than developed by the fullest\r\nexperience and the widest knowledge. Necessary incompatibility of mental\r\nqualities has no place in this matter; what has led to the erroneous\r\nassumption that it has, is the excessive exercise by exceptional\r\nindividuals of certain powers—a specialism necessary for effort and\r\nsuccess, but deliberately chosen, and not due to an inborn\r\none-sidedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE LAND OF AZURE BLUE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Côte d’Azur whither many of my readers will be travelling—in\r\nthought, if not in reality—about Easter time, is well named the Land of\r\nAzure Blue, for it is the blueness of the sea, of the sky, and of the\r\ndistant rocks and mountains, as well as much of the vegetation, which is\r\nwhen the sun shines, its special charm. And although one has some wet\r\nand some cloudy days, yet the sun does shine there with a strength and\r\nbrilliancy not to be enjoyed in the early part of the year on the\r\nAtlantic and North Sea coast. This tract of country, more commonly known\r\nto English people as the Riviera, has very special meteorological\r\nconditions owing to its position as the narrow strip of shore-line\r\nexisting between the vast mass of the Western Alps and the Mediterranean\r\nSea. It is warmed by the sea, and lies too close under the mountains to\r\nbe caught by any winds from the north, and at many points is also\r\neffectively protected from both east and west winds by rocky spurs of\r\nthe great mountain chain.\r\n\r\nThe Riviera is a constant source of delight to those who love flowers\r\nand beautiful vegetation of all kinds. But few of its visitors\r\nappreciate the fact that it is really from end to end one big garden,\r\ncultivated for ages by its inhabitants, and full of plants introduced by\r\nman which at present seem at first sight to be characteristic natives\r\nof it, but are, in reality, quite distinct from its primitive\r\nvegetation. This primitive vegetation is now represented only in what is\r\nlocally called the “maquis”—what we should, perhaps, term the “scrub”\r\nor “bush” in English. It comprises some pines, the juniper, the lovely\r\nrock roses, balsams, rosemary, the giant heath (bruyère), from which our\r\nbriar-root pipes are made, the larger thyme, the myrtle, the rose of\r\nProvence, two kinds of lavender, and many aromatic plants with grey\r\nhairy leaves, and often provided with sharp thorns as additional\r\ndefences against browsing goats. The delicious perfumes of these hardy\r\ninhabitants of the dry, rocky grounds, where little or no grass can\r\nflourish, are developed by them as a protection against browsing\r\nanimals, who cannot tolerate much of these pungent volatile oils,\r\nalthough mankind extracts them and uses them in the manufacture of such\r\nscents as eau-de-Cologne and also in cookery.\r\n\r\nMany a visitor to the Riviera never strays from the cultivated fields\r\nand roadways into this scrub-land. The olive tree, which forms so\r\nprominent and beautiful a feature in the panorama of gardens which\r\nunrolls itself as we steam or drive along the coast from Toulon to\r\nMentone and from Mentone to Genoa and Spezzia, is not a native plant; it\r\nwas introduced in prehistoric times, and has been again and again\r\nre-established by emigrants from Italy; but it was brought to Italy from\r\nthe East. It is astonishing how many of the cultivated trees of the\r\nRiviera have the same kind of history—the vine came from India in\r\nprehistoric times, the fig tree more recently from Persia, the lemon\r\nfrom India, the orange and the peach tree from China. All of them were\r\nintroduced in very ancient times to the eastern parts of the\r\nMediterranean basin, and so gradually were carried to the shores of the\r\nLigurian sea, and would die out here were they not to a certain extent\r\nunder the care of ownership.\r\n\r\nThe so-called “mimosa,” so abundant here, with its pretty,\r\nsweet-scented, yellow blossom, is an Australian acacia, only introduced\r\nsome sixty years ago; whilst the eucalyptus—a most picturesque and\r\neffective addition to the landscape—is a still later introduction from\r\nAustralia. The cypress, that darkest and most shapely of conifers, long\r\nlines of which proclaim to the traveller as he passes Avignon his\r\narrival in the true “South,” is not a native of these parts, although it\r\nflourishes in suitable situations. It was introduced in mediæval times\r\nfrom the East. So, too, the palms, though some have been cultivated for\r\ncenturies, have been largely imported from extra European localities in\r\nthe last century. There is a native European palm. It is a kind of\r\nfan-palm, and grows here. I have gathered it in Sicily. It does not\r\n“rear its stately head” more than a foot from the ground, and is known\r\nto botanists as _Chamærops humilis_. The gigantic Mexican agave and the\r\nprickly-pear cactus were introduced in the seventeenth century from the\r\nNew World, though, according to Sir Herbert Tree’s scenery, they were\r\ngrowing at Cape Miseno in the time of Antony and Cleopatra! Bamboos of\r\nmany kinds have been introduced here from the Far East, and flourish\r\nexceedingly.\r\n\r\nThe orange tree was brought from India (whither it was carried from\r\nChina) and established in Southern Europe in mediæval times, though\r\nknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans. There are as many as 120\r\ndifferent varieties of the orange tree now cultivated on the shores of\r\nthe Mediterranean, including, besides those which are valued for their\r\nsweet juicy pulp, those which furnish bergamot oil and similar aromatic\r\nproducts. The “issue pea” of old apothecaries, which was bound into a\r\ncut made in a patient’s flesh for the purpose of producing inflammation\r\nand suppuration, with the notion that such treatment was beneficial, was\r\na minute unripe orange dried, and, no doubt, to some extent, antiseptic.\r\n\r\nBesides the introduced trees, we find, in ground which has been more or\r\nless under cultivation, and not, therefore, of the nature of the\r\n“maquis,” or scrub-land, some beautiful plants, such as the narcissus,\r\niris, and various lilies. One very small and graceful tulip is, I\r\nbelieve, regarded as native to the soil, but a magnificent crimson\r\ntulip, as large as the varieties cultivated in English gardens, which I\r\nhave found abundantly in open park-like land under olive trees at\r\nAntibes, is said to have been introduced from Persia in the Middle Ages,\r\nand to have taken kindly to the Riviera. It is the _Tulipa oculus\r\nsolis_. In the same locality were growing many brilliantly coloured\r\n“stellate” anemones.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a third group or “lot” of plants on the Riviera,\r\nwhich consists of those brought from all parts of the world during the\r\npast century, and regularly cultivated and cared for in gardens. The\r\nclimate of the Riviera enables the gardener to grow all sorts of\r\nsub-tropical plants in the open air, and a long list of them could be\r\ngiven. The wonderfully brilliant crimson creeper, Bougainvillia, covers\r\nwalls by the roadways, and even the railway stations, with its rich\r\ncolour at this season. A delightful book by the distinguished botanist,\r\nProfessor Strasburger, describing and picturing in colours many of the\r\ncultivated as well as the wild plants of the Riviera, has lately been\r\npublished (in English) at a small price.\r\n\r\nThe animals which come under the notice of those who go in search of\r\nspring sunshine to the Riviera are far less numerous than the plants.\r\nBut there is one which is dear to all, although it makes such a noise\r\nfor an hour or so about sunset that some people are irritated or even\r\nalarmed by it. This is the little green tree-frog, Fig. 1, which now\r\ncomes forth from its winter sleep, and assembles in thousands—guided by\r\nthe “croak” or “call” which is produced by the males. The females have a\r\nvery small voice comparatively. I kept two—a male and female—through a\r\nwinter in London, and when the spring came the male terrified the\r\nhousehold one night by unexpectedly uttering his cry—loud and sharp—to\r\nwhich the female replied. “Wharr! biz” is the nearest expression I can\r\ngive in letters to the two sounds. After a great many evenings spent in\r\nthese rhythmical declamations, the little frogs collect round pools and\r\ntanks, and at last drop from the trees into the water, and there deposit\r\ntheir spawn. When producing his cry the male distends the skin of his\r\nthroat like a balloon. The air is driven alternately from it into the\r\nlungs and back again over the vocal chords, which vibrate with no\r\nuncertain sound. These little frogs are easy to keep in an inverted\r\nbell-jar or in a fern-case, but must be fed regularly with flies and\r\nspiders, which they catch by a sudden dab of the tongue at the moment of\r\nalighting from a long leap on to the glass where the insect is crawling.\r\nThey can hold on to smooth glass or leaves by means of their sucker-like\r\ntoes (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe colour of the upper surface of the South European tree-frog is a\r\nmost vivid and smoothly laid-on grass-green. Occasionally the colour\r\nbecomes altered to a brownish purple, but returns after a day or two to\r\nits usual bright green tint. A great rarity is the blue variety of this\r\nfrog—the enchanted Prince of the Côte d’Azur—blue as the sky and the\r\nsea around him—the true _genius loci_. I obtained one a few years ago\r\nat Mentone, and kept it alive for three years in London. Its blue was\r\nthe blue of the forget-me-not or the finest turquoise. When it died (I\r\nbelieve of old age, and not from discomfort or disease) I examined its\r\nskin very carefully with the microscope, and compared it with that of\r\nthe ordinary green tree-frog, in order to make out the cause of their\r\ndifference in colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—The little green tree-frog or “rainette” of the\r\nRiviera (_Hyla arborea_). From Professor Gadow’s volume on _Reptiles and\r\nAmphibia_—in the “Cambridge Natural History”—published by Macmillan &\r\nCo., by whose permission this figure is here produced.]\r\n\r\nAt Mentone there is a little shop where one may purchase green\r\ntree-frogs and ornamental cages in which to keep them. Every year the\r\ndealer has two or three specimens of the blue variety on sale—their\r\nbacks and heads looking like bits of turquoise-blue kid. Visitors have\r\nsometimes wrongly supposed that the blue frogs had been artificially\r\nchanged in colour, but they are real, natural varieties. A similar\r\nsubstitution of blue for green has been noticed as a rare variation in\r\nother kinds of frogs and toads in other countries. It really consists in\r\na suppression of yellow pigment.\r\n\r\nThe interesting thing about the colour of the little tree-frogs is that\r\nwe find, on careful examination of the skin of a dead specimen with the\r\nmicroscope, that there is no green nor yet any blue “pigment” present in\r\nit. I found, on examining the blue specimen which died after living\r\nthree years with me, that there is only black pigment overlaid by a\r\ncolourless, semi-transparent layer of skin. In this outer skin in the\r\nordinary green specimens there is scattered a quantity of excessively\r\nminute yellow particles, which, mixed with the blue, produce the green\r\nappearance. The fact is, that the wonderful “dead” turquoise-blue of the\r\nblue frog is a colour-effect similar to that of the blue sky and the\r\nblue of the human eye. It is produced by a peculiar reflection of the\r\nlight from minute colourless particles, without the assistance of any\r\nblue-coloured substance. The distinction of these two modes of producing\r\nblue colour is important.\r\n\r\nCertain transparent bodies are so constituted that when a beam of light\r\nis directed so as to pass through them, the red, yellow, green, and\r\npurple rays which exist in colourless sunlight are stopped, and only the\r\nblue rays come through. Such a body is blue copperas, or sulphate of\r\ncopper; another is methyl blue, one of the aniline dyes; another is pure\r\nwater, which gives only a slight advantage to the blue rays, so that the\r\nlight must pass through a thickness of 30 feet or more before the blue\r\ntint is obvious. Thus, part of the blueness of the Côte d’Azur is\r\naccounted for—namely, the blueness of the sea when the sunlight is\r\nstrong and is reflected from the white rocks and sand lying 30 feet to\r\n100 feet below the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, other self-coloured transparent bodies which allow\r\nonly rays of one colour to pass. Thus, blood-red, or hæmoglobin, the\r\npigment of the blood, allows chiefly red rays to pass through it. Yellow\r\nrays only pass through a solution of saffron or of chromic acid; green\r\nonly or chiefly through green copperas (sulphate of iron) or through\r\nleaf-green or chlorophyll. Colour is very generally due in natural\r\nobjects to such transparent bodies which absorb or stop all the coloured\r\nrays of light as it passes through them, excepting those of one\r\ntint—or, to be more correct, nearly all except those of one tint.\r\n\r\nBut the blue of the blue frog and a great deal of the blue in nature is\r\ndue to another cause. If you are a smoker, or the friend of a smoker,\r\nwatch the fine curling lines of smoke ascending from a cigar when it is\r\nbeing consumed in bright sunshine. You will see that it has a blue, even\r\nan azure blue, tint as the sunlight falls upon it. But if you let the\r\nsmoke get between the sun and your eyes you will notice that the little\r\ncurling clouds are no longer blue, but reddish-brown, in appearance. The\r\nsmoke is not a transparent blue; looked at as a transparent body, it is\r\nbrown! Further, when the smoke has passed into the smoker’s mouth and is\r\nejected after remaining there for a few seconds, the cloud no longer\r\nlooks blue, even when the sunlight falls on it and is reflected from it\r\nto your eye. It is now opaque white or colourless, with, perhaps, a\r\nfaint tinge of blue. This change is due—as was shown by the experiments\r\nof the late Professor Tyndall upon a variety of clouds and vapours—to\r\nthe cooling of the smoke and the increased size of the floating\r\nparticles which coalesce as the temperature falls. The larger particles\r\nreflect white light, and the cloud is no longer blue. A cloud formed by\r\nthe finest particles gives the strongest blue to the light reflected\r\nfrom it, and it is to this property of the finest particles of\r\nwater-cloud floating in our atmosphere that the blue colour of the sky\r\nis due.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the question arises, “Why do clouds of the finest particles\r\nreflect a predominant amount of blue light rather than yellow or green\r\nor red?” That question is answered by mathematicians in accordance with\r\nwhat is ascertained as to the nature and properties of light, but it\r\nwould require a long treatise to put those matters even in outline\r\nbefore the reader. We may in the meanwhile accept the conclusions of the\r\nphysicists, and interest ourselves in seeing how they apply to some of\r\nthe concrete facts about colour in Nature.\r\n\r\nThere are other instances of “blueness” due to the reflection of light\r\nfrom a cloud of excessively minute particles besides that of the azure\r\nsky and the blue, curling smoke of a wood fire. A familiar instance is\r\nthe blueness of translucent bodies, such as the “white” of a boiled\r\nplover’s egg, especially when a bit of it is placed on a dead-black\r\nground. The bluish appearance of watered London milk is another\r\ninstance. These bodies look blue owing to the fine, colourless particles\r\nsuspended in them, which act on light in the same way as do the fine\r\nparticles of newly-produced smoke. Another very interesting case is the\r\nblue colour of the iris of the eye of man and other animals. It is not\r\ndue to any blue pigment, but to a reflection from fine particles in the\r\ntranslucent, but turbid, tissue of the iris overlying the dark, black\r\nchamber of the eye. White geese and white cats frequently have blue\r\neyes, the blue being thus produced. The only pigment which occurs in the\r\nhuman eye is a brown one, which gives a colour varying from amber yellow\r\nto very dark brown, almost black, according to the quantity present.\r\nWhen a very little of it is present it gives, in combination with the\r\nblue appearance of the unpigmented iris, a green tint, so that green\r\neyes owe their colour to the same combination of causes as does the\r\ngreen skin of the little tree-frogs, or “rainettes.”\r\n\r\nNo solvent will extract any pigment from the skin of the blue frog—nor\r\nby the finest trituration can one obtain any coloured particles from it;\r\nonly fine black granules can be separated. Alcohol removes the yellow\r\npigment from the skin of a green tree-frog (killed, of course, for the\r\nexperiment), and for a minute or two the skin becomes blue when its\r\nyellow pigment is thus removed by immersion in spirit; but it rapidly\r\nbecomes a dull greyish-brown in colour, and so remains; the green cannot\r\nbe preserved in spirit-specimens. It is not fully explained how such a\r\nuniform “dead” blue is produced by the reflection of light from fine\r\nparticles, as that observed in the blue frog’s skin.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the blue and the green colour in the feathers of birds\r\nis in most, if not all, cases produced in the same way as the blue and\r\ngreen of the tree-frog’s skin. It would be interesting were it found\r\npossible to produce a full dead-blue colour by experimentally placing a\r\ncoat of a translucent but turbid colourless medium on a dead-black\r\nplate. This, however, has not been done as a deliberate experiment. It\r\nis, however, recorded that Goethe was delighted to find what he\r\nconsidered to be a confirmation of his theory of colour when a friend\r\nshowed him an oil-painting of a gentleman in a black coat which when\r\nwetted with a sponge turned bright blue. The picture had been recently\r\n“restored,” and the varnish on the black coat was not “dry.” It was\r\nprecipitated by the water from the sponge, mixing with the spirit which\r\nheld it in solution. A fine colourless cloud was thus produced overlying\r\nthe black paint of the coat, and, as in the case of the cerulean frog, a\r\ndead-blue colour, due to reflection of the light by the fine particles,\r\nwas the result. Some friendly physicist might repeat this experiment and\r\nstudy the matter in detail. The red, orange, and yellow colours of\r\nbirds’ feathers are produced by pigments which are either insoluble or\r\nonly soluble with great difficulty in fluids of the nature of ether.\r\nThere is, however, an exception in the case of the African birds called\r\nTuracous, or Plantain-eaters. These birds have some large quill-feathers\r\nin the wing of a rich crimson colour. This splendid red pigment can be\r\nwashed out of the feathers by water which is slightly alkaline, and a\r\nfine blood-red solution is obtained. Why this curious exception exists\r\nwe do not know. The extracted colour is found to contain the element\r\ncopper as one of its chemical components. Plantain-eaters kept in cages\r\nhave sometimes washed all the colour out of their feathers owing to the\r\nwater supplied to them for bathing and drinking having become foul and\r\nammoniacal, and thus capable of dissolving the red pigment.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation on the Riviera of flowers for sale as “cut flowers” in\r\nParis, London, and Berlin, in the colder months of the year, is now an\r\nenormous business, bringing many thousands of pounds yearly to the small\r\ngardeners around Hyères, St. Raphael, Nice, and Mentone. Roses, violets,\r\ncarnations, “mimosa” of various kinds, anemones, lilies, and narcissus\r\nare sent literally in tons by quick trains several times a week from\r\nthese realms of sunshine to the dreary North. The commencement of this\r\ntrade was due to the suggestion made some fifty years ago by Alphonse\r\nKarr, the French poet and journalist, who had a beautiful garden of his\r\nown at St. Raphael, and found that he could produce flowers in profusion\r\nthrough the winter. Two years ago I visited this garden (which now\r\nbelongs to a French painter) at the beginning of April, and found it\r\nfull of interesting flowers and shrubs, enormous bamboos, palm trees,\r\nsome twenty different “mimosas,” eucalyptus of several species, camellia\r\ntrees, and rose-bushes in quantity.\r\n\r\nThe influence of man on the vegetation of a favoured locality like the\r\nRiviera is more striking than in the North. But it is worth remembering\r\nthat the most familiar tree in England—the common elm—is not a native,\r\nbut introduced from South Europe. Our native elm is the wych-elm, or\r\nmountain elm—a much handsomer tree, in the opinion of many, than the\r\nso-called “common elm.” There are doubts as to whether both the spruce\r\nand the larch were not introduced by man at a very remote time, so that\r\nthe Scotch fir would be our only aboriginal pine. The oak, beech, birch,\r\nash, hawthorn, poplar, and alder are undoubted native English trees. The\r\nholly-oak or evergreen oak, the sycamore, plane-tree, sweet chestnut,\r\nhorse chestnut, walnut, and probably the lime or linden tree have been\r\nintroduced by migrating men at various periods into our islands. With\r\nthe exception of rye and oats none of the plants which we cultivate for\r\nfood are derived from our own wild plants, and none of our domesticated\r\nanimals have been produced from native wild kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nFRESH-WATER JELLY-FISHES\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people nowadays know a jelly-fish when they see one—and recognise\r\nthat it is eminently a product of the sea—one sees them washed up on\r\nthe seashore, soft discs of transparent jelly of the size of\r\ncheese-plates (Fig. 2). They have a mouth in the centre of the disc,\r\noften at the end of a depending trunk, like the clapper of a bell. Some\r\nhave tentacles, sometimes yards long, which sting like nettles. They\r\nalso have eye-spots, an internal system of canals and muscles which\r\nenable them to swim by causing the edge of the disc or bell to contract\r\nand expand in alternate strokes. There are hundreds of kinds of marine\r\njelly-fish varying in size from a sixpence to that of a dinner table,\r\nand until twenty-five years ago none were known to live in ponds, lakes,\r\nor rivers. Although they often are carried up estuaries, and may stay\r\nfor a time in brackish water, or even in fresh water, none were known\r\nwhich really lived and bred in fresh water. They were regarded, as are\r\nstar-fishes and sea-urchins, as distinctively marine, and debarred by\r\nthe delicacy of their watery jelly-like substance from tolerating the\r\nchange from sea water to fresh water as a permanent thing. All\r\nfresh-water animals—fishes, shell-fish, cray-fish, worms, and\r\npolyps—are derived from closely similar marine animals, are in fact\r\nsea-things which have suffered a change, and been able to stand it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—The common jelly-fish (_Aurelia aurita_)\r\none-third the natural size; _or_, one of the four arms or fleshy\r\ntentacles surrounding the diamond-shaped mouth; _Tc_, one of the eight\r\neye-bearing tentacles at the edge of the disc; _GP_, opening of one of\r\nthe four sub-genital pouches, which bring sea-water close to the ovaries\r\nand spermaries, which, however, do not open into these pouches; _x_ and\r\n_y_, outline of the sub-genital pouches seen through the jelly.]\r\n\r\nThese being our preconceptions about jelly-fish, great was the\r\nexcitement when, in 1880, hundreds of beautiful little jelly-fish were\r\nsuddenly discovered briskly expanding and contracting, rising and\r\nsinking in the water of a large fresh-water tank in the middle of London\r\n(Fig. 3). You never know who or what may turn up in London. A badger, a\r\ngreen parakeet, a whale, an African pigmy, an Indian scorpion, and a\r\nvoice worth ten thousand a year, have all, to my knowledge, been\r\nstumbled upon unexpectedly at different times in the highways of London.\r\nA new jelly-fish was perhaps one of the least expected “casual\r\nvisitors.” It was found in the large tank four feet deep in which the\r\ngreat tropical water-lily—the Victoria regia—and other tropical water\r\nplants are grown in the Botanic Gardens, Regent’s Park. It came up by\r\nhundreds every year for some ten years after its first appearance, dying\r\ndown in six weeks or so each season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—The fresh-water jelly-fish (_Limnocodium_)\r\nenlarged four times linear measurement, as it is seen dropping through\r\nthe water in a glass jar. _PT_, one of the four principal tentacles.\r\n_MR_, the margin of the disc. _Ve_, the delicate muscular frill or\r\nvelum.]\r\n\r\nAll the specimens were males, and the puzzle was to find out how it\r\nreproduced itself. After a few seasons had passed I determined to solve\r\nthis problem. I made the guess that perhaps the jelly-fish were budded\r\noff from a fixed weed-like polyp growing in the depths of the tank—as\r\nis the case with many of the marine jelly-fishes. I remember that one\r\nleading member of the council, which still presides over the destinies\r\nof the Botanic Gardens, confided to me in a hushed whisper his belief\r\nthat Providence created this new jelly-fish year by year in the tank in\r\nhonour of the august patroness of the Botanic Society—Her Royal\r\nHighness the Duchess of Teck. I was obliged to make an end of this\r\nflattering theory when I discovered, after long searching with my\r\nassistant—attached to the rootlets of floating water weeds a minute\r\nthree-branched polyp (Fig. 4), from which, as we subsequently were able\r\nto observe, the jelly-fish were pinched off as tiny spheres about\r\none-sixteenth of an inch in diameter. No females of this jelly-fish were\r\never discovered. The polyps lived on from year to year, and budded off\r\neach season a swarm of pretty but futile male jelly-fish. They ripened\r\nand died on attaining a diameter somewhat less than that of a shilling.\r\nThere were many most interesting points made out as to their structure,\r\nmode of feeding, and growth. You could keep them in a tall glass jar\r\nsupported over a small gas-jet (they lived best at a temperature of 80°\r\nFahr.), and they would swim up by a series of strokes to the top of the\r\nwater, and then drop like little parachutes through the eighteen inches\r\nof depth to the bottom—taking in water-fleas and such food on the\r\nway—and immediately would start upwards again. I used to take them\r\nalive in my pocket corked up in a test-tube to show to friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—Four of the minute club-shaped polyps adhering\r\nto a root-fibre of a water-plant. The rounded end becomes nipped off and\r\nswims away, free, as a young jelly-fish.]\r\n\r\nAfter they had disappeared from the tank in Regent’s Park (owing to some\r\nunhappy cleaning of the tank) they suddenly, in 1903, appeared—it seems\r\nincredible—at Sheffield! Then they briefly showed up in 1905 at Munich,\r\nand at Lyons had been captured in 1901—always in a tepid water-lily\r\ntank! We never could make out where they came from originally. Of\r\ncourse, the polyp must have been brought into the tank with some bundle\r\nof water plants from a tropical lake or river, but we never had any\r\nindication as to when or which.\r\n\r\nSince the days of the fresh-water jelly-fish of Regent’s Park, which was\r\ncalled (a name, but why should it not have a name?) _Limnocodium\r\nSowerbii_—a jelly-fish of about the same size (Fig. 5) but very\r\ndifferent in shape and tentacles—was discovered in the great African\r\nfresh-water lake Tanganyika—in enormous numbers, and was named\r\n_Limnocnida Tanganyikæ_. Only five years ago the same jelly-fish was\r\ndiscovered in the Victoria Nyanza, and a little earlier in backwaters of\r\nthe Niger. It is a curious and significant fact bearing upon the history\r\nof these three areas of fresh water connected with the three greatest\r\nAfrican rivers—the Congo, the Nile, and the Niger—that the same little\r\njelly-fish is found in all of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—The African fresh-water jelly-fish\r\n(_Limnocnida_) found in Tanganyika, Victoria Nyanza, and the Niger.]\r\n\r\nAnd now we have just been reminded of _Limnocodium_, the Regents Park\r\njelly-fish, from a remote and unexpected source. A thousand miles up\r\nthe Yang-tse-Kiang River, in China, in the province of Hupi, the\r\nJapanese captain of a river steamer, plying there and belonging to a\r\nJapanese company, captured ten jelly-fish in the muddy waters of the\r\nriver. He brought them home, preserved, I suppose, in alcohol or\r\nformalin, and they have been described by Dr. Oka, a Japanese zoologist\r\nof Tokio, in a publication bearing the Latin title _Annotationes\r\nZoologicæ niponenses_, issued in December 1907. European sea captains\r\nhave not rarely been ardent naturalists, but I think the Japanese is the\r\nfirst captain of a river steamboat who has discovered a new animal on\r\nhis beat. I have not heard of Mississippi steamboat captains amusing\r\nthemselves in this way—other rivers, other tastes.\r\n\r\nDr. Oka describes the jelly-fish thus brought to him as a _Limnocodium_,\r\ndiffering in a few details from that of Regent’s Park, so that he\r\ndistinguishes this Chinese species as _Limnocodium Kawaii_, naming it\r\nafter the naturalist captain, who must have a rare taste for picking up\r\nstrange and new things, and a rare goodwill in bringing them home with\r\nhim. So here is another fresh-water jelly-fish, for it is not the same\r\nas the Regent’s Park one, though closely like it. Possibly _Limnocodium_\r\nis an Asiatic genus, and the original Sowerby’s _Limnocodium_ will be\r\nfound in another Chinese river. But it may prove to be South American,\r\nas is the water-lily Victoria regia.\r\n\r\nA very small fresh-water jelly-fish was found some twelve years ago—in\r\n1897—in the Delaware River at Philadelphia, United States, and was\r\nlately described by the well-known naturalist, Mr. Potts. It was budded\r\noff from a very minute polyp resembling that found in the Regent’s Park,\r\nbut the jelly-fish was totally different from _Limnocodium_. Only four\r\nor five specimens of this jelly-fish have ever been seen, and the\r\nPhiladelphian naturalists ought certainly to look it up again.\r\n\r\nAn account of the Philadelphian jelly-fish and of other fresh-water\r\njelly-fishes, with illustrative plates, will be found in the _Quarterly\r\nJournal of Microscopical Science_, 1906. Mr. Charles Boulenger has, in\r\nthe same Journal, 1908, described yet another fresh-water jelly-fish\r\nfrom the Fayoum Lake in Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE COMMON EEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the Scotch Highlanders are said to have a profound objection to\r\neating eels on account of the resemblance of these fish to snakes (not a\r\nvery good reason, since the quality and not the shape of what one eats\r\nis the important thing), yet eels have been a very popular delicacy in\r\nEngland in past days. Eel-pie Island, at Richmond, is known to most\r\nLondoners, and eel-pie shops were familiar in London less than a century\r\nago. A good Thames eel is still appreciated by the few people who\r\nnowadays take some small amount of intelligent interest in what they\r\neat. Abroad, eels are still popular. Eel-traps are still worked in the\r\nrivers. In such districts as the flat country, on the shores of the\r\nAdriatic, near Venice, millions of young eels are annually “shepherded”\r\nin lagoons and reservoirs, and reared to marketable size. The inland\r\neel-fisheries of Denmark and Germany are carefully regulated and\r\nencouraged by the Government in those States.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that railways, ice-storage, and steam-trawling have, in\r\nconjunction, revolutionised our habits in regard to the use of fish as a\r\ndaily article of diet. Fresh-water fish are now almost unknown as a\r\nregular source of food in the British Islands. The splendid fish of the\r\nNorth Sea, the Channel, and the Atlantic coast have pushed them out of\r\nthe market. Thirty-eight years ago, when I was a student in Leipzig and\r\nVienna, “baked carp” was the only fish to be had in the dining-rooms we\r\nfrequented. Once a week there were fresh haddock, for those who fancied\r\nthem, in the celebrated Auerbach’s Keller. Now the railway and packing\r\nin ice have brought North Sea fish to the centre of Europe, and created\r\na taste for that excellent food. Even on the Mediterranean at Nice, I\r\nlately saw North Sea turbot, soles, and haddock lying on the\r\nmarble-slabs in the fish market side by side with the handsome but small\r\nbass, mullet, gurnards, and sea-bream of the local fishery, and the\r\ncarp, pike, trout, and eels of the fresh waters of the South of France.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the eel—the common fresh-water eel—is still valued on the\r\nContinent, as is proved by the fact that the German Imperial Government\r\nhas recently sent an important official of the Fisheries Department to\r\nGloucester in order to make extensive purchases of the “elvers,” or\r\nyoung eels which come up the river Severn in millions at this season.\r\nThe purpose of the German fisheries officials is to place many hundred\r\nthousands of these young eels in German rivers which are not so well\r\nsupplied by natural immigration as is the Severn, and by so doing to\r\nincrease the supply of well-grown eels hereafter in the river fisheries\r\nof North Germany.\r\n\r\nThis interesting practical attempt to increase the supply of eels in\r\nGermany will be further appreciated when I relate what has been\r\ndiscovered within the last twenty years as to the reproduction,\r\nmigrations, and habits of the common fresh-water eel. It has been known,\r\ntime out of mind, that in the early months of every year millions of\r\nyoung eels a little over two inches in length, called “elvers” in\r\nEnglish and “civelles” in French, come up the estuaries of the rivers of\r\nEurope in a dense body. They are so closely packed together as the\r\nnarrower parts of the stream are reached, that thousands may be taken\r\nout of the water by merely dipping a bucket into the ranks of the\r\nprocession. I obtained a few thousand of these “elvers” lately from the\r\nSevern and placed them on exhibition in the central court of the Natural\r\nHistory Museum in London. The Anglo-Saxon name “eel-fare” is given to\r\nthis annual march or “swim” of the young eels from the sea to the fresh\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nThough riverside folk have never doubted that the elvers are young eels\r\nwhich have been hatched from spawn deposited by parent eels in the sea,\r\nand are “running up” to feed and grow to maturity in the rivers and\r\nstreams inland, yet country folk away from the big rivers have queer\r\nnotions as to the origin and breeding of eels. They catch large, plump\r\neels a couple of feet long in stagnant ponds hundreds of miles from the\r\nsea, far from rivers, and more than a thousand feet above the sea-level.\r\nThey have no notion that those eels originally “ran up” as little eels\r\nfrom the sea, nor that many of them make their way across wet grass and\r\nby rain-filled ditches back to the rivers and to the sea when they are\r\nseven years old. But that is now known to be the fact. Just as there are\r\nfish, like the salmon, which “run down” to the sea to feed and grow big\r\nand “run up” to breed in the small pools and rivulets far from the\r\nriver’s mouth, so there are other fishes, of which the eel is one, which\r\nrun up to feed and grow and run down to breed—that is to say, to\r\ndeposit and fertilise their eggs in the depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nFishermen who work river-fisheries for eels (far more valued abroad than\r\nin England) distinguish “yellow eels” and “silver eels” (see Plate I.\r\nopposite title page). We used to distinguish also snigs and grigs, or\r\nnarrow-nosed and broad-nosed eels (probably males and females). The\r\nremarkable fact, admitted by both fishermen and anatomists, was that you\r\ncould not really tell male from female, nor, indeed, ever find an eel\r\n(that is, a common eel, as distinguished from the much larger and\r\nwell-known conger eel) which was ripe, or, indeed, showed any signs of\r\nhaving either roe or milt within it. A popular legend exists that eels\r\nare produced by the “vivification” of horse-hair. Occasionally in summer\r\na long, black, and very thin threadworm (called _Gordius_ by\r\nnaturalists) suddenly appears in great numbers in rivers, and these are\r\ndeclared by the country-folk to be horse-hairs on their way to become\r\neels! I remember a sudden swarm of them one summer in the upper river at\r\nOxford. Really, they are parasitic worms which live inside insects for a\r\npart of their lives, and leave them in summer, passing into the water.\r\nFanciful beliefs about aquatic creatures are common, because it is not\r\nvery easy to get at the truth when it is not merely at the bottom of a\r\nwell but at the bottom of a river or of the deep sea! The fishermen of\r\nthe east coast of Scotland, who think very highly of their own knowledge\r\nand intelligence, believe that the little white sea-acorns or\r\nrock-barnacles are the young of the limpets which live side by side with\r\nthem, and are scornful of those who deny the correctness of what they\r\nconsider an obvious conclusion!\r\n\r\nA few years ago the Scandinavian naturalist, Petersen, showed that the\r\n“silver” eels are a later stage of growth of the “yellow” eels; that\r\nthey acquire a silvery coat, and that the eye increases in size—as a\r\nsort of “wedding dress,” just before they go down to the sea to breed. I\r\nowe to Petersen’s kindness the coloured drawings of the heads of the\r\nyellow and the silver eel reproduced in Plate I. These silver eels are\r\ncaught in some numbers about the Danish coast and river mouths, moving\r\ndownwards; and Petersen has been able to distinguish the males from\r\nthe females by finding the still incompletely formed milt and roe within\r\nthe silver eels. Not only that, but one of Petersen’s assistants at the\r\nDanish Biological Station has found that you can tell the age of an eel\r\nby the zones or rings shown by its scales, when examined with a\r\nmicroscope, just as the age of trees can be told by the annual rings of\r\ngrowth in the wood. Most people, even if familiar with eels, even cooks\r\nwho have skinned an eel, do not know that they have scales; but they\r\nhave,—very small ones. The age of other fishes has been similarly\r\nascertained by annual zones of growth marked on the scales; and lately\r\nthe age of plaice has been found to be conveniently given by zones of\r\ngrowth formed annually on the little ear-stones which we find in the\r\nliquid-holding sac of the internal ear. I am afraid many of my readers\r\nwill be surprised to learn that fishes have an internal hearing\r\napparatus similar to our own, also that they have olfactory organs, and,\r\nin some cases, a well-grown tongue!\r\n\r\nThe power thus obtained of telling the age of an eel has led to the\r\nfollowing knowledge about them, namely, that female eels do not become\r\n“silver” eels and “run down” before they are seven years old, and often\r\nnot till eight and a half years of age, or even sometimes eleven or\r\ntwelve years, when they are nearly 3 feet long. The male eel becomes\r\n“silver” (instead of “yellow”) at an earlier age—four and a half\r\nyears,—and rarely defers his nuptial outburst until he is seven or\r\neight years old. The females of the same age are larger than the males;\r\na usual size for silver females of seven years old is a little over 2\r\nfeet, and of a silver male of the same age 20 inches.\r\n\r\nThe further facts which I am about to relate as to the migration and\r\nreproduction of the common eel are of great interest. The common\r\n“yellow” eels of our ponds and rivers, as we have seen, when they are\r\nfrom five to seven years old and over, put on, as it were, a wedding\r\ndress. They become “silver” eels, and descend the rivers to the sea.\r\nThere they produce their spawn. The young eels thus produced, when only\r\n2 inches long, leave the sea. Every year they ascend the estuaries and\r\nrivers of Europe as “elvers” in enormous numbers, their procession up\r\nthe rivers being known as “the eel-fare.”\r\n\r\nSome eels, shut up in moats and ponds, never escape—they become more or\r\nless “silver” and restless, but fail to get away. Others crawl up the\r\nbanks in wet, warm weather, when the ponds are full to the brim, and\r\nover the meadows. They are found sometimes on their journey when they\r\n\r\n        “... have to pass\r\n  Through the dewy grass,”\r\n\r\nand so to the river, and on to the marriage feast in the deep sea. The\r\nfact is, that usually eels inhabit in large numbers the rivers and\r\nstreams, and have no difficulty in getting down to the sea when they are\r\nadult. Those who, as young elvers, have wandered far off into sunken\r\nponds and reservoirs, are eccentric spirits who have lost the normal way\r\nof life; like fellows of colleges in the old days, they have cut\r\nthemselves off from the matrimonial “running down,” but they have\r\ncompensations in quietude, abundant food, and a long life.\r\n\r\nWe now know where the silver eels go when they run down the rivers. They\r\ngo into the sea, of course; but we know more than that. It has now been\r\ndiscovered that they make their way for many miles along the\r\nsea-bottom—in some cases hundreds of miles—to no less a depth than 500\r\nfathoms. In the Mediterranean they don’t have very far to go, for there\r\nis very deep water near the land, and Professor Grassi found evidence of\r\ntheir presence in the depths of the Straits of Messina. But the eels of\r\nthe rivers which empty into the North Sea and English Channel have much\r\nfarther to go; they have to go right out to the deep water of the\r\nAtlantic, off the west coast of Ireland. That is the nearest point where\r\n500 fathoms can be touched; there is no such depth in the North Sea nor\r\nin the Channel. They never come back, and no one has ever yet tracked\r\nthem on their journey to the deep water. Yet we know that they go there,\r\nand lay their eggs there, and that from these remote fastnesses a new\r\ngeneration of eels, born in “the dark unfathomed depths of ocean,”\r\nreturn every year in their millions as little “elvers” to the rivers\r\nfrom which their parents swam forth in silver wedding dress. Soon, we\r\nhave reason to hope, by the use of suitable deep-sinking nets, we shall\r\nintercept, in the English Channel, some of the silver eels on their way\r\nto the Atlantic deeps. They must go in vast numbers, and yet no one has\r\nyet come across them. How, then, do we know that the silver eels ever go\r\nto this 500-fathom abysm?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—Young stages of the common eel, drawn of the\r\nnatural size by Professor Grassi. A, The _Leptocephalus_, transparent\r\nstage. D, the elver, or young eel, which is coloured, and of much\r\nsmaller size than the transparent, colourless creature by the change of\r\nwhich it is produced. It is the elver which swims in millions up our\r\nrivers. B and C are intermediate stages, showing the gradual change of A\r\ninto D.]\r\n\r\nThe answer is as follows: A very curious, colourless, transparent,\r\nabsolutely glass-like, little fish, 2½ inches long, oblong and\r\nleaf-like in shape, has been known for many years as a rarity, to be\r\ncaught now and then, one at a time, floating near the top in summer seas\r\n(Fig. 6). I used to get it at Naples occasionally many years ago, and it\r\nhas sometimes been taken in the English Channel. It is known by the name\r\n“Leptocephalus.” Placed in a glass jar full of sea-water it is nearly\r\ninvisible on account of its transparency and freedom from colour. Even\r\nits blood is colourless. The eyes alone are coloured, and one sees these\r\nas two isolated black globes moving mysteriously to the right and the\r\nleft as the invisible ghostly fish swims around. Twenty years ago one of\r\nthese kept in an aquarium at Roscoff, in Brittany, gradually shrunk in\r\nbreadth, became cylindrical, coloured and opaque, and assumed the\r\ncomplete characters of a young eel! To cut a long story short, these\r\nLeptocephali were found twelve years ago in large numbers in the deep\r\nwater (400 fathoms) of the Straits of Messina by the Italian naturalists\r\nGrassi and Calandruccio, and they conclusively showed that they were the\r\nyoung phase—the tadpole, as it were—of eels. They showed that\r\ndifferent kinds of eels—conger eels, the Muræna, and the common\r\neel—have each their own kind of transparent “Leptocephalus-young-phase,”\r\nliving in but also above the very deep water, in which they are hatched\r\nfrom the eggs of the parent eels. The Leptocephalus-young when hatched,\r\ngrow rapidly, and ascend to near the surface immediately above the deep\r\nwater, and are caught at depths of ten to a hundred fathoms. To become\r\n“elvers,” or young eels, they have to undergo great change of shape and\r\ncolour, and actually shrink in bulk—a process which has now been\r\ncompletely observed and described. It is not surprising that their true\r\nnature was not at first recognised. The proof that the silver eels of\r\nNorth and West Europe go down to the 500-fathom line off the Irish\r\ncoast, in order to lay their eggs, is that the Danish naturalist Schmidt\r\nand his companions discovered there two years ago, above these great\r\ndepths (and nowhere else), by employing a special kind of fine-meshed\r\ntrawling net, many thousands of the flat, glass-like\r\n“Leptocephalus-young-stage,” or tadpole of the common eel, and traced\r\nthem from there to their entrance into the various rivers. They showed\r\nthat the Leptocephali gradually change on the way landward into eel-like\r\n“elvers.”\r\n\r\nThe rivers nearest the deep water, such as those opening on the west\r\ncoast of Ireland and on the Spanish and French shores of the Bay of\r\nBiscay, get their elvers “running up” as early as November, December,\r\nand January. The farther off the river the farther the elvers have to\r\ntravel from the deep-sea nursery, so that in Denmark they don’t appear\r\nuntil May. Not the least curious part of the migration of the eel is the\r\npassage of the young elvers into the higher parts of rivers and remote\r\nstreams. They are sometimes seen a hundred miles from the sea, actually\r\nwriggling in numbers up the face of a damp rock or wall ten or fifteen\r\nfeet high, pushing one another from below upwards, so as to scale the\r\nobstacle and reach higher waters, like Japanese soldiers at a fort. I\r\nfound them (so long ago that I hesitate to name the date—it was a year\r\nof cholera in London, followed by a great war) in a little rivulet which\r\ncomes down the cliff at Ecclesbourne, near Hastings, close to a cottage\r\nfrequented at that time by Douglas Jerrold. They were wriggling up in\r\nthe damp grass and overflow of the driblet 150 feet above the shore, a\r\nstone’s throw below. They must have come out of the sea, attracted by\r\nthe tiny thread of fresh water entering it at this spot.\r\n\r\nThe Danube and its tributary streams contain no eels, although the\r\nrivers which open into the Mediterranean are well stocked with them.\r\nThis is supposed to be due to the fact that the Black Sea does not\r\nafford a suitable breeding-ground, and that the way through the\r\nDardanelles is closed to eels by some natural law, as it has been to\r\nwarships by treaty. Probably, however, it will be found that the\r\ngeological changes in the area of sea and land are intimately connected\r\nwith the migrations of the eel, and that the eel is originally a marine\r\nfish which did not in remote ages travel far from the deep waters. Its\r\ngradually acquired habit of running up fresh waters to feed has led it\r\nstep by step into a frequentation of certain rivers which have become\r\n(by changes of land and sea) inconveniently remote from its ancestral\r\nhaunts. An interesting question is whether at the not very distant\r\nperiod when there was continuous land joining England to France and the\r\nThames and the Rhine had a common mouth opening into the North Sea, eels\r\nexisted in the area drained by those two rivers; and, if so, by what\r\nroute did they pass as silver eels to the deep sea, and by what route\r\ndid the new generations of young eels hatched in the deep sea travel to\r\nthe Thames and Rhine. It seems most probable that in those days there\r\nwere no eels in the Thames and other North Sea rivers.\r\n\r\nOur present knowledge of the romantic history of the common eel of our\r\nown rivers we owe in large part to the work done by the International\r\nCommittee for the Investigation of the North Sea. Who would ever have\r\nimagined when he caught a wriggling eel, with a hook and worm thrown\r\ninto a stagnant pool in the Midlands, that the muddy creature was some\r\nfive or six years ago living as a glass-like leaf-shaped prodigy in the\r\nAtlantic depths, a hundred miles from Ireland? Who would have dreamed\r\nthat it had come all that long journey by its own efforts, and would\r\nprobably, if it had not been hooked, have wriggled one summer’s night\r\nout of the pond, across wet meadows, into a ditch, and so to the river,\r\nand back to the sea, and to the far-away orgy in the dark salt waters of\r\nthe ocean-floor, to the consummation of its life and its strange,\r\nmysterious ending?\r\n\r\nThere are two points of interest to be mentioned in regard to the rivers\r\nDanube and Thames in connection with eels. I have trustworthy reports of\r\nthe very rare occurrence of eels in streams connected with the Danube.\r\nSince the young elvers do not ascend the Danube, where do these rare\r\nspecimens come from? There can be no doubt that they have made their way\r\nindividually into the Danube “system” by migration through canals or\r\nditches from tributaries of the Rhine or the Elbe. A similar explanation\r\nhas to be offered of the eels which at present inhabit the Thames. I\r\ncannot find any evidence of the existence to-day of an “eel-fare”—that\r\nis, “a running up of elvers” in the river Thames. Probably about the\r\nsame time as the foul poisoning of the Thames water by London sewage and\r\nchemical works put an end to the ascent of the salmon (about the year\r\n1830), the entrance of the myriad swarm of young eels in their annual\r\nprocession from the sea also ceased. The elvers were caught and made\r\ninto fish-cakes in London before the nineteenth century, just as they\r\nare to-day at Gloucester. It would be interesting to know exactly when\r\nthey ceased to appear in the Thames. A curious fact, however, is that\r\nyoung eels—not so small as “elvers,” but from three inches in length\r\nupwards—are taken close above London even to-day. Four years ago I\r\nobtained a number of this small size from Teddington. The question\r\narises as to whether these specimens represent just a small number of\r\nelvers which have managed to swim through the foul water of London and\r\nemerge into the cleaner part of the river above. This is improbable. It\r\nis more likely that they have come into the Thames by travelling up\r\nother rivers such as the Avon—which are connected by cuttings with the\r\nThames tributaries. But it certainly is remarkable that eels of only\r\nthree inches in length—and therefore very young—should have managed to\r\nget not merely “into” the Thames (to the upper parts of which no doubt\r\nmany thus travel and remain during growth), but actually “down” the\r\nThames so far in the direction of its tidal water as is Teddington lock.\r\nThe specimens from Teddington were placed by me in the Natural History\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nMODERN HORSES AND THEIR ANCESTORS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ever-increasing development of motor traffic leads to speculation as\r\nto what is to be in the immediate future the fate of the horse. What is\r\nits history in the past?\r\n\r\nIt is in nearly all cases a matter of great difficulty to trace the\r\nanimals and plants which mankind has domesticated or cultivated to the\r\noriginal wild stock from which they have been derived. Lately we have\r\ngained new knowledge on the origin of the domesticated breeds of the\r\nhorse. It is generally agreed that the Mongolian wild horse represents\r\nthe chief stock from which the horses of Europe and those conveyed by\r\nEuropeans to America were derived. This wild horse was formerly known as\r\ninhabiting the Kirghiz steppes, and was called the Tarpan. It became\r\nextinct there some seventy years ago. The natives of that district\r\nasserted that the pure breed was only to be met with farther East in the\r\nGobi Desert of Central Asia. The Tarpan itself showed signs of mixed\r\nblood in having a mouse-coloured coat, which is a sure indication\r\namongst horses of cross-breeding. Prevalsky, a Russian traveller, was\r\nthe first to obtain specimens of the pure-bred wild horse of the Gobi\r\nDesert, which still exists. Live specimens have been brought to Europe,\r\nand some are in the possession of the Duke of Bedford. A female is\r\nmounted and exhibited in the Natural History Museum, and also a skeleton\r\nand skulls. Prevalsky’s horse, or the Mongolian wild horse, is of small\r\nstature, standing about twelve hands at the shoulder. The root of the\r\ntail is short-haired, the mane short and upright, without forelock. The\r\nbody colour is yellow dun, the mane and tail black, as well as the lower\r\npart of the legs, and there is a dark stripe down the back. The muzzle\r\nin pure-bred specimens is white. The head is relatively large and the\r\nmuzzle thick and relatively short. A very decided character is shown by\r\nthe great size and relative length of the row of cheek-teeth, it being\r\none-third larger than the same row of teeth in a Dartmoor pony of the\r\nsame stature.\r\n\r\nA very interesting fact, which goes a long way to establish the view\r\nthat the European domesticated horse is derived from the Mongolian wild\r\nhorse, comes to us in a most striking way from some of the most ancient\r\nrecords of the human race. In the South of France the contents of caves\r\nformerly inhabited by men have been dug out and examined with increasing\r\ncare and accuracy of late years, though first investigated fifty years\r\nago. Similar caves, though not so prolific of evidences of human\r\noccupation, have been explored in England (Kent’s Cavern at Torquay, and\r\nothers). The astounding fact has now become quite clear that these caves\r\nwere inhabited by men of no mean capacity from 50,000 to 250,000 years\r\nago, when bone harpoons, flint knives, flint scrapers, and bone\r\njavelin-throwers were the chief weapons in use, when these islands were\r\nsolidly joined to the European continent, when a sheet of glacial ice,\r\nalternately retreating and extending, covered the whole of Northern\r\nEurope, and when the mammoth, rhinoceros, hyena, lion, bear, bison,\r\ngreat ox, horse, and later the reindeer, inhabited the land and were\r\nhunted, eaten, and utilised for their bone, tusks, and skin by these\r\nancient men. I revert to this subject in a later article (page 371), but\r\nwould merely say now that it is all as certain and well-established a\r\nchapter in man’s history as that of the ancient Egyptians, who are\r\nreally quite modern (dating from 8000 years at most) as compared with\r\nthese cave-men of 50,000 years ago, and the even earlier races which\r\npreceded them in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe bones of the animals killed and eaten by the cave-men are found in\r\nsome cases in enormous quantities. In one locality in France the bones\r\nof as many as 80,000 horses (which had been cooked and eaten) have been\r\ndug up and counted! The most wonderful and extraordinary thing about\r\nthese cave-men is that they carved complete rounded sculptures, high\r\nreliefs, low reliefs, and line-engravings on mammoth’s ivory, on\r\nreindeer horn, on bones, and on stones—the line-engravings being the\r\nlatest in date, as shown by their position in the deposits on the floor\r\nof the caves, which are often as much as twenty feet or thirty feet in\r\nthickness! Not only that, but these carvings are often real works of\r\nart, extremely well drawn, and showing not mere childish effort but work\r\nwhich was done with the intention and control of an artist’s mind.\r\n\r\nAn immense number of these carvings are now known. I have before me one\r\nof the most recent publications on the subject—a series of plates\r\nshowing the carvings collected from caves in the Pyrenees, the Dordogne,\r\nand the Landes by M. Piette, who recently died. I have examined his\r\ncollection and others of the same kind in the great Museum of St.\r\nGermain, near Paris. We have in London some of the earlier collections,\r\nand especially that of the Vicomte de Lastic, to purchase which my old\r\nfriend Sir Richard Owen journeyed to the Dordogne in the winter of 1864.\r\nMany animals, as well as some human beings (Fig. 7), are represented in\r\nthese carvings—the mammoth itself, carved on a piece of its own ivory,\r\nis among them, and a good many represent the horse (Fig. 8). Now it is a\r\nfact that the carvings of the horses of that period undoubtedly\r\nrepresent a horse which is identical in proportions, shape of head,\r\nmane, and tail, with the wild Mongolian horse, and is unlike in those\r\npoints to modern European horses, or to the Arabian horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—Drawing (of the actual size of the original) of\r\nan ivory carving (fully rounded) of a female head. The specimen was\r\nfound in the cavern of Brassempouy, in the Landes. It is of the earliest\r\nreindeer period, and the arrangement of the hair or cap is remarkable.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—Drawing (of the actual size of the original) of\r\na fully rounded carving in reindeer’s antler of the head of a neighing\r\nhorse. The head resembles that of the Mongolian horse. This is one of\r\nthe most artistic of the cave-men’s carvings yet discovered. It is of\r\nthe Palæolithic age (early reindeer period), probably not less than\r\nfifty thousand years old. It was found in the cavern of Mas d’Azil,\r\nAriège, France, and is now in the museum of St. Germain.]\r\n\r\nIt was, until the discoveries of M. Piette, held that though the\r\ncave-men killed, ate, and made pictures of the horse of those remote\r\ndays, yet that they did not tame it, put a halter or a bridle on it, and\r\nmake use of it. Some of the carvings figured by M. Piette leave,\r\nhowever, no room for doubt that the cave-men fitted a bridle to the head\r\nand muzzle of the horse. These carvings (Fig. 9) show a twisted thong\r\nplaced round the nose and passing near the angle of the mouth where it\r\nis possible, though not certain, that a “bit” was inserted. Connected\r\nto this main encircling thong are four twisted cords (on each side of\r\nthe head), which run horizontally backwards, and the two lower of these\r\nare joined by a flat, plate-like piece, which is ornamented. The whole\r\napparatus is further connected to a twisted cord on each side, which\r\nruns towards the back of the head, but it is not shown in the carving\r\nwhat becomes of it. Thus it seems clear not only that the cave-men of\r\nthese remote ages were wonderful artists, but that they mastered and\r\nmuzzled the horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—Drawing (of the actual size of the original) of\r\na flat carving in shoulder-bone, of a horse’s head, showing twisted\r\nrope-bridle and trappings. _a_ appears to represent a flat ornamented\r\nband of wood or skin connecting the muzzling rope _b_ with other pieces\r\n_c_ and _d_. This specimen is from the cave of St. Michel d’Arudy, and\r\nis of the reindeer period. This, and others like it, are in the museum\r\nof St. Germain.]\r\n\r\nSome of the engravings of horses’ heads seem to indicate the existence\r\nof a horse alongside the commoner form with a narrower, more tapering\r\nface, and may possibly be due to the introduction, even at that remote\r\nperiod, of another race distinct from the Northern or Mongolian wild\r\nhorse. That this admixture of a distinct and more slender horse with the\r\nNorthern horse has taken place over and over again in historical times\r\nis a matter of knowledge. The question is, when did it first take place,\r\nand where did the more slender horse come from? In later days we know\r\nthis more shapely breed as the Arab and the Barb, and the introduction\r\nof its blood at various times into the more Northern stock is well\r\nascertained. The latest great historical case of such admixture is the\r\nproduction of the English thoroughbred in the eighteenth century by\r\nsuch sires as the Darley Arabian, the Godolphin Barb, and the Brierley\r\nTurk, whose blood is transmitted to modern racehorses through the great\r\nhistoric sires, Herod, Matchem, and Eclipse, the ancestors of\r\npractically all modern racehorses.\r\n\r\nThe horse of more Southern origin thus recognised as distinct from the\r\nprehistoric European horse, it is now convenient to speak of as the\r\nSouthern or Arabian horse. There are certain curious structural features\r\nwhich seem to mark these horses and their offspring, even when their\r\nstrain is blended with that of the more Northern horse. Probably from\r\nthe time of the cave-men onward the selective breeding of horses has\r\nbeen carried on, so that in many breeds size has been vastly increased.\r\nIt is an important fact that the English racehorse has never been\r\nselected and bred for “points” (as cattle and sheep are), but always by\r\nperformance on the racecourse. Thus it becomes an extremely interesting\r\nmatter to see what are the changes which the breeder of thoroughbred\r\nstock has unconsciously produced—what are the differences between the\r\nracehorse of to-day and that of 50, 100, and 150 years ago. This was\r\npointed out to me by the late Duke of Devonshire as a reason for\r\nsupporting my proposal to secure and place in the Natural History Museum\r\nthe skulls, limb-bones, hoofs, and other indestructible parts of great\r\nracehorses (and of other breeds), and also for having very accurately\r\nmeasured reduced models made of such horses, in order that we may after\r\nsome years compare the proportions and structure at present arrived at\r\nwith the later developments which the continual selection of winner’s\r\nblood in breeding must unconsciously produce. Such a collection was\r\nstarted by me in the museum, but it needs the assistance of owners of\r\nhorses—both as to placing record specimens in the museum and in paying\r\nfor the preparation of accurately reduced models by competent artists.\r\nIt already comprises the skulls of Stockwell, Bend Or, and Ormonde, and\r\nseveral carefully made reduced models of celebrated horses. There is no\r\ndoubt that the English racehorse has increased in size. He is a bigger\r\nanimal to-day than he was 200 years ago, and the opinion of the best\r\nauthorities is that he has increased on the average an inch in height at\r\nthe withers in every twenty-five years. The racehorse has a much longer\r\nthigh-bone and upper-arm bone (in proportion to the rest of the leg)\r\nthan has the cart-horse, and it is probable that this length has been\r\ncontinually increased by the selection of winners for breeding.\r\n\r\nThere are other points of scientific interest as to modern horses and\r\ntheir forefathers which are illustrated by valuable specimens and\r\npreparations placed by me in the Natural History Museum.\r\n\r\nAll those hairy warm-blooded quadrupeds which suckle their young, and\r\nare hence called mammals, are the descendants of small five-toed\r\nancestors about the size of a spaniel. This is equally true of the\r\nelephant, the gorilla, the horse, and the ox. In the sands and clays\r\ndeposited since the time of the chalk-sea, the remains (bones and teeth)\r\nof the ancestors of living mammals are found in great abundance. These\r\nsands and clays are called “the Tertiaries,” and are divided into lower,\r\nmiddle, and upper—whilst we recognise as “Post-Tertiaries” (or\r\nQuaternary) the later formed gravel and cave deposits in which the\r\nremains and weapons of the cave-men have been found. The Tertiaries\r\nconsist of a series of deposits amounting to about 3000 feet in\r\nthickness, and they have taken several million years in depositing—no\r\none can say how many.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIPPARION HORSE\r\n\r\nFIG. 10.—To the left, the fore-foot of the horse-ancestor, Hipparion,\r\nshowing three toes: to the right, the back view of a long bone of a\r\nmodern horse’s foot, with rudiments of outer toes, called splint-bones.]\r\n\r\nIn the upper Tertiary we find the remains of a kind of horse (the\r\nHipparion), with well-developed “petti-toes” (like those of a pig) on\r\neach side of the big central toe (Fig. 10). In the middle Tertiary we\r\nfind smaller ancestral horses, with three toes of nearly equal size, and\r\nin the lower Tertiary a horse-ancestor as small as a fox-hound (the\r\nHyracotherium), with four toes on its front foot and three on its hind\r\nfoot. Coming very close to this in general character is another small\r\nextinct animal of the same age, with five toes on each foot. As the toes\r\nhave dwindled in number and size, leaving at last only the big central\r\ntoe (as we pass upward from the small ancestors to the big modern\r\nhorse), so the cheek-teeth, too, have changed. At first they had shallow\r\ncrowns and divided fangs, and showed four prominences on the crown which\r\nwere little, if at all, worn down during life. But as the horse became a\r\nbigger animal and took to eating coarse tooth-wearing grass, his teeth\r\nbecame deeper, and continued to grow for a long time, whilst the crown\r\nwas rubbed down by the hard food, and a curiously complex pattern was\r\nbrought into view by the exposure of the irregular bosses of the crown\r\nin cross section. And, meanwhile, the size and proportions of the\r\nhorse-ancestors changed until, after being pig-like, then tapir-like,\r\nthey acquired the perfect form and size for fleet and prolonged movement\r\nover firm, grass-grown plains. Horses and other large animals have to\r\nrun, not only to escape pursuit by carnivorous enemies, but in order to\r\ntravel, before they die from thirst, from a region suddenly dried up by\r\ndrought to a region where water can be had. Many thousands of wild\r\nanimals perish every year from local droughts in Africa. No small\r\nanimals can exist in regions liable to be affected by sudden drought.\r\n\r\nThree-toed horses, like the upper Tertiary Hipparion, are occasionally\r\nborn as “monstrosities” from ordinary horses at the present day. All\r\nhorses have the remnant of a toe on each side of the big central toe—in\r\nthe form of splint-bones—concealed beneath the skin. In some breeds,\r\nfor instance, in the “Shire” horses, which have enormous hairy feet in\r\nproportion to their huge strength and weight, these splint-bones tend to\r\ndevelop three little toe-joints, which are immovable, but obviously are\r\n“petti-toes.” It is related by Suetonius that Julius Cæsar used to ride\r\na favourite horse which had several toes on each foot with claws like a\r\nlion. This was one of the “monstrosities” alluded to above, a throw-back\r\nto the ancestral many-toed condition. Specimens illustrating these, and\r\nall else which I am here relating concerning horses, and much more which\r\nI have not space to tell, may be seen in the North Hall of the Natural\r\nHistory Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—Skulls of horses and of deer to show the\r\npre-orbital pit or cups _pf_, and its absence in the Mongolian\r\n(Prevalsky’s) horse.]\r\n\r\nThe three-toed ancestral horse, Hipparion, attained a fair size (that of\r\na big donkey), and was shaped like the recent fleet one-toed horses. In\r\nthe skull in front of the orbit, the Hipparion has a strongly marked\r\ndepression in the bone, as long and broad as a hen’s egg, and in shape\r\nlike one-half of an egg cut through longwise (see Fig. 11 _pf_). These\r\npre-orbital cavities are known in deer, sheep, and antelopes; they lodge\r\na gland resembling the tear-gland, which has, itself, a separate\r\nexistence. Similar “glands” are found in the feet and ankle-joints of\r\nsheep and deer. The fluid which they secrete probably has an odour (not\r\nreadily noticed by man) which helps to keep the herd together, or, on\r\ncertain tracks when the fluid is smeared on to herbage. It is a\r\nremarkable fact that the skulls of the wild Mongolian horse and of the\r\nfossil horse of the cave-men, as also those of the commoner European\r\nbreeds, have no trace of this pre-orbital cup or of the gland which\r\nHipparion, their three-toed ancestor, possessed. Nor, indeed, have the\r\nasses and zebras. But the Southern horse, the Arab, and all the breeds\r\ninto which his blood has prominently entered—as, for instance, the\r\nEnglish racer (so-called “thoroughbred”) and the “Shire” horse (which\r\nis derived from the old English war-horse, in the making of which\r\ncertainly four hundred years ago Arab blood and heavy Northern stock\r\nwere mingled), do show, as a rule, a well-marked if shallow, cup-like\r\ndepression in front of the orbit! In fact, as Mr. Lydekker has pointed\r\nout, the presence of this “pre-orbital cup” is evidence of the descent\r\nof its possessor from Arab ancestry. Many specimens of horses’ skulls\r\nshowing this “cup” are exhibited in the Natural History Museum. We have\r\nnot been able to find any trace of a gland like the “larmier” of deer\r\nand the “crumen” of antelopes on examining the soft tissues which\r\noverlie this cavity in horses of Arab descent, but it is not improbable\r\nthat occasional instances of such survival will some day come to light.\r\nA very interesting fact in connection with this concavity and its\r\nindication of a distinction between the Northern (Mongolian) and the\r\nSouthern (Arabian) horse is that in India a fossil horse of very late\r\nTertiary date has been found, a true one-toed horse, not a Hipparion,\r\nwhich has the pre-orbital cup well marked, and is possibly the ancestor\r\nof the Arab.\r\n\r\nThere is no very great difference between the wild horse and wild asses\r\nand zebras. They are distinct “species,” but will breed together and\r\nproduce “mules,” which in rare cases appear to be themselves fertile,\r\nalthough this is doubtful. The inner causes of the infertility of mules\r\nare not really known or understood. Nor, in fact, do we know really and\r\nexperimentally what are the causes of fecundity and of infecundity in\r\nnormally paired animals, including mankind. It is of the utmost\r\nimportance to modern Statecraft that this subject should be studied, and\r\nthere is a great field for experimental inquiry.\r\n\r\nA clear mark of difference between the horse and the other species of\r\nthe genus Equus (namely, the Asiatic and African asses and the zebras)\r\nis found in the curious wart-like knobs[1] on the legs, which are called\r\n“chestnuts.” These warty knobs appear to be the remains in a “dried up”\r\ncondition of glands, such as are found in the legs of deer in a similar\r\nposition, and secrete a glairy fluid. In new-born colts they sometimes\r\nexude a fluid, and also more rarely in adult horses. The fluid attracts\r\nother horses (probably by its smell), and also causes dogs to keep\r\nquiet. The horse has one of these wart-like “chestnuts” above the wrist\r\njoint (so-called knee) on the inner side of the fore-leg. And so have\r\nall the asses and zebras. But the horse (Fig. 12) has also a similar\r\n“chestnut” on the inner side of each of its hind-legs, below the\r\nheel-bone, or “hock.” This hind-leg chestnut is absent in all asses and\r\nzebras. This difference between the horse and ass can be tested by my\r\nreaders on any roadside by their own observation. The hind-leg chestnut\r\nis also absent in certain breeds of ponies from Iceland and the\r\nHebrides. Its presence and absence are interesting in connection with\r\nthe disappearance of the face-gland or pre-orbital gland in all recent\r\nhorses, asses, and zebras.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—Fore and hind legs of horse and ass, to show\r\nthe “chestnuts,” and the absence of that structure from the hind-leg of\r\nthe ass.]\r\n\r\nThe “chestnuts” of the horse have sometimes been compared erroneously to\r\nthe “pads” on the feet of other animals, and supposed to be survivals of\r\na “pad” in each foot corresponding to the inner of the three toes of\r\nthe Hipparion. The real representative, in the horse, of the chief pad\r\nof the foot of animals which do not (as the horse does) walk on the very\r\ntip of the toe, is a little knob called the “ergot.” The diagram, Fig.\r\n13, shows how this ergot corresponds to the chief pad of the three-toed\r\ntapir’s foot, and so to that of the dog also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—Diagram of the under surface of the foot in the\r\ndog, tapir, and horse, to show that the horny knob of the horse’s foot,\r\ncalled the “ergot,” corresponds to the central “pad” of the other two.]\r\n\r\nThe absence of living horses, or of any kind of ass or zebra, from the\r\nAmerican Continent, when first colonised by Europeans in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, is a very singular fact. For we find a great number and variety\r\nof fossil remains of extinct horses in both North and South America. It\r\nseems possible that some epidemic disease swept them from the whole\r\nContinent not very many centuries before Europeans arrived—for there is\r\nevidence in South America of the co-existence there of peculiar kinds of\r\nhorse with the “Indian” natives. It is even alleged that Cabot, in 1530,\r\nsaw horses in Argentina, which were the last survivors of the native\r\nSouth American species. And it is also said that the Araucanian Indians\r\nof Patagonia have a peculiar breed of ponies, which may be derived in\r\npart from a native South American stock. I have never been able to\r\nprocure a skull of this breed, or any detailed description of it. What\r\nis quite certain is that in the great cave of Ultima Speranza, in\r\nPatagonia—from which the hairy skin, dried flesh and blood, and\r\nunaltered dung as well as the bones, of the giant sloth Mylodon were\r\nobtained—a great number of the horny hoofs, and the teeth of a peculiar\r\nhorse were also found some eight years ago, and are preserved in the\r\nNatural History Museum, together with the remains of the giant sloth.\r\nThe condition of these remains is such that they cannot be many\r\ncenturies old. The animals appear to have been contemporaneous with an\r\nearly race of Indians who made use of the cave before the arrival of\r\nEuropeans. A skull of one and a skeleton of another of the peculiar\r\nextinct South American horses (called Onohippidium and Hippidium), which\r\nsurvived until a late period in Patagonia and may possibly have been\r\nseen by Cabot, are shown in the Natural History Museum. Their bones are\r\nfound in the superficial gravel and sand of the pampas.\r\n\r\nTo revert for a moment to the history of the English thoroughbred. It\r\nappears that in England in the middle of the eighteenth century a happy\r\nnew infusion of the Arab race with that of existing stock (which already\r\ncontained some Arab blood mixed with that of the Northern race) produced\r\nonce and for all a very perfect and successful breed. That breed did not\r\nderive speed from the Arab, but “stamina,”—probably a powerful heart.\r\nIt did not derive its size from the Arab, but the cross proved to be a\r\nlarge horse. It has never been improved since by any further admixture\r\nof Arab or Southern blood. Hence the (at first sight) misleading name\r\n“thoroughbred.” This name is not intended to imply that the breed is not\r\noriginally a “blend,” but that those horses so called are pure-bred from\r\nthe happy and wonderful mixture which a hundred and fifty years ago was\r\nembodied in the great sires Matchem, Herod, and Eclipse.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] The names “malander” and “salander” have been recently applied by\r\nzoological writers, apparently by misconception, to these “callosities”\r\nor “chestnuts.” Those names are used by veterinary surgeons to describe\r\na diseased condition of this part of the horse’s leg (Italian “_mal\r\nandare_”), and do not apply to the “chestnut” itself, which is sometimes\r\ncalled “castor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nA RIVAL OF THE FABLED UPAS TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are so accustomed nowadays to danger to life and health from minute,\r\ninvisible germs, and to exerting all our skill in order to destroy them,\r\nthat the knowledge of the existence of large and beautiful trees in our\r\nmidst which can, and do, cause terrible disease and suffering by their\r\nmere presence, comes as a shock, and produces a peculiar sense of\r\ninsecurity greater even than that excited by unseen micro-organisms. For\r\nthe trees of which I am about to speak are cultivated in our gardens,\r\ntrained up against the walls of our houses with loving care, and admired\r\nfor the beautiful autumn tints of their leaves. Yet it is now certain\r\nthat they are the cause in many persons of most terrible suffering and\r\nillness. I am glad to be able to warn my readers in regard to these\r\nplants, and I shall be very much interested to hear whether the\r\ninformation which I am about to give proves to be of value in any\r\nparticular case.\r\n\r\nA married couple, friends of my own, went to live, about fourteen years\r\nago, in a newly built, detached house, standing in its own garden, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of an English city. After they had been there two\r\nyears the lady developed a very painful eruption or eczema on the face,\r\nwhich, in the course of a few weeks, caused the eyes, nose, and lips to\r\nswell to an extraordinary degree, accompanied by the formation of\r\nblisters and breaking of the skin. The affection spread to the body, and\r\ncaused constant pain and corresponding prostration. Her medical\r\nattendants were unable either to cure or to account for her condition.\r\nAfter some months she left home, and entirely recovered. But every year\r\nthe same distressing and disfiguring illness attacked her (commencing in\r\nthe month of June), and disappeared as soon as she left her house, only\r\nto return when she came back to it. The doctors spoke of her affliction\r\nas a mysterious form of erysipelas, and even suggested blood-poisoning\r\nas the cause. For long periods she was so ill and in so much pain that\r\nshe was unable to see her friends, and her life was at times in danger.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago a weekly newspaper published an account, written by a\r\ncorrespondent, of an illness from which he had suffered—exactly\r\nagreeing with that which had for so many years tortured my friend’s\r\nwife. This writer stated that he had ascertained that the disease was\r\ndue to the action of a poison given off by a creeper which grew on the\r\nwalls of his house. He had supposed this plant to be a Virginian\r\ncreeper; but he had discovered that it was in reality the Californian\r\npoison-vine called by botanists _Rhus toxicodendron_. The terribly\r\npoisonous nature of this plant is well-known to the people of the United\r\nStates. It is one of the sumach trees, of which other poisonous kinds\r\nare known, whilst more than one species is used (especially in Japan)\r\nfor preparing a resinous varnish which is used in the manufacture of\r\n“lacquered” articles. The writer in the weekly paper stated that he had\r\ncut down and burnt the poison-vine which grew on the walls of his house,\r\nand that his sufferings had ceased. My friend happened to read this\r\naccount, and immediately examined his own house. He found a creeper\r\nresembling a Virginian creeper, but having three leaflets or divisions\r\nof the leaf instead of five, growing around his drawing-room window, and\r\nactually spreading its branches and leaves over the window of his wife’s\r\nbedroom. He sent specimens of the creeper to Kew, where it was at once\r\nidentified as the _Rhus toxicodendron_ or American poison-vine or\r\npoison-ivy. He caused the plant to be removed and burnt, and, except for\r\na slight attack in July, due no doubt to fragments of the leaves still\r\ncarried about in the form of dust, his wife has recovered her health.\r\n\r\nI have looked into this matter with care, and I find that (presumably in\r\nignorance) nurserymen in England have sold specimens of the poison-vine\r\nfor planting as creepers, under the name _Ampelopsis Hoggii_. The\r\nsmaller-leaved Virginian creeper, with self-attaching tendrils, is known\r\nas _Ampelopsis Veitchii_, and is, like the larger Virginian creeper (_A.\r\nquinquefoliata_), quite harmless. The poison-vine is not an Ampelopsis\r\nat all, not even one of the Vitaceæ or vine family, as that genus is. It\r\nis a Sumach or Rhus, and belongs to a distinct family, the\r\nTerebinthaceæ. It has a three-split leaf, not five leaflets, as has the\r\nlarge Virginian creeper, nor a small three-pointed leaf, as has the\r\n_Ampelopsis Veitchii_. The _Veitchii_ frequently has the leaf also split\r\ninto three leaflets, but the stalk of the middle leaflet is not\r\nrelatively so long as it is in the poison-vine. The differences and\r\nresemblances in the leaves of these plants are shown in the accompanying\r\nillustration (Fig. 14), which has been prepared from actual specimens\r\nfor this book.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States are on their guard against this plant,\r\nknowing its terrible properties. Sir William Thiselton Dyer, formerly\r\ndirector of Kew Gardens, tells me that specimens of the “American\r\npoison-vine” are grown in the garden at Kew, and that he has been\r\npresent when American visitors (ladies) literally screamed with horror\r\non seeing it, and ran from it as from a mad dog. Several cases are on\r\nrecord of the mysterious poisoning produced by this plant in England;\r\nbut it is strangely unfamiliar to medical practitioners—indeed,\r\npractically unknown to them, although I have ascertained that many\r\nEnglish people, especially ladies, have been victims for some years to\r\nits unsuspected influence.\r\n\r\nAt the University of Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, they have\r\nmade quite recently a thorough examination of the poison-vine in the\r\nlaboratory, with the following results: The poison is an oil—a fixed\r\noil, not a volatile one, as we might have imagined from its mysterious\r\naction at a distance. The oil exists in all parts of the plant, even in\r\nthe fine hairs and cuticle of the leaf. It can be extracted by means of\r\nether, and is one of the most virulent irritants known, having a very\r\ncurious penetrating and persistent action, and producing violent pain\r\nand destruction of tissue when placed on the skin in quantity so minute\r\n(one-thousandth of a milligram in two drops of olive oil) as to be\r\nbeyond the terms of everyday language. It seems to be usually brought to\r\nthe eyes, nose, lips, and skin of the face and body by the fingers which\r\nhave touched a leaf or fragments of a leaf in powder. The dead leaf in\r\nwinter still retains the oil, and minute dust-like particles can carry\r\nit. The treatment for it is washing with soap, oil, and ether at an\r\nearly stage of the attack—especial care being taken to free the fingers\r\nfrom any minute traces of the oil adhering to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—Drawings, about half the natural size, of the\r\nleaves of the common quinquefoliate Virginian creeper (1 and 2), of the\r\nadherent “Ampelopsis Veitchii” (3 and 4), and of the poison-vine, _Rhus\r\ntoxicodendron_ (5 and 6). From specimens in the Botanical Department of\r\nthe Natural History Museum. Note especially the greater length of the\r\nstalk of the central leaflet in the poison-vine. Note also that the\r\ncommon Virginian creeper has sometimes only three leaflets (2) instead\r\nof five, and that “Veitchii” has either three leaflets, as in 3, or has\r\nthe leaflets united into one three-pointed leaf, as in 4.]\r\n\r\nThe poison of the poison-vine only acts upon a limited number of\r\nindividuals, many people being perfectly immune. At the same time, the\r\neffect upon susceptible people appears to be enhanced with every fresh\r\nattack; even after the total removal of the poison-vine and its dust\r\nfrom proximity to a susceptible person, he or she is apt for some\r\ntime—owing to the retention of some trace of the oil in the skin or\r\nclothes—to have slight attacks. According to a writer who two years ago\r\ngave in the _Spectator_ an account of his own case, the first symptom of\r\nan attack is almost invariably a redness and irritation of the eyelids,\r\naccompanied by shivering. In a few hours the eyelids are closed, the\r\nfeatures unrecognisable, and the skin covered with little blisters. Then\r\nthe lips swell enormously, the glands of the neck also. In four days the\r\narms and hands are reached, each finger appearing as if terribly scalded\r\nand requiring separate bandaging. Then sometimes the lower limbs are\r\ninvolved. After ten days the attack passes off, leaving the patient in a\r\npitiable state of weakness to grow a new skin and recover from other\r\npainful results of the poisoning. But no immunity is conferred by an\r\nattack; the unhappy victim (who is ignorant of the cause of his\r\nsufferings) may, and frequently does, get a new dose of the poison as\r\nsoon as he has recovered, and the whole course of the illness has again\r\nto be passed through. If this account should fall into the hands of any\r\none who is being unwittingly poisoned by the American poison-vine, and\r\nmay therefore be saved by what I have written from further suffering, I\r\nshall be greatly pleased.\r\n\r\nThere are very few plants which have a power of diffusing poison around\r\nthem; usually it is necessary to touch or to eat portions of a plant\r\nbefore it can exert any poisonous effect. The eighteenth-century story\r\nof the upas-tree of Java, which was fabled to fill a whole valley with\r\nits poisonous emanation, and to cause the death of animals and birds at\r\na distance of fifteen miles, is now known to be a romantic invention.\r\nThe tree in question is merely one having a poisonous juice which was\r\nextracted and used by the wilder races of Java as an arrow poison. It is\r\nstated that one of the stinging-nettles of tropical India has such\r\nvirulent poison and such an abundance of it in the hairs on its\r\nsurface, that explorers have been injured by merely approaching it, the\r\ndetached hairs probably floating in the air and getting into the eyes,\r\nnose, and throat of any one coming near it. The poison of the poisonous\r\nstings of both plants and of animals has been to some extent examined of\r\nlate years. It is a curious fact that there are proportionately few\r\nplants which sting as compared with the number and variety of animals\r\nwhich do so. On the other hand, there are an enormous number of plants\r\nwhich are poisonous to man when eaten by him, but there are very few\r\nanimals which are so.\r\n\r\nIt will be of interest to my readers to know that I received, in\r\nconsequence of the publication of the foregoing account of the\r\n“Poison-vine” or “Poison-ivy,” more than fifty letters and boxes\r\ncontaining leaves. At Kew Gardens nearly a hundred applications were\r\nmade with a request for the identification of leaves. The proportion of\r\ncases in which leaves of true poison-ivy (_Rhus toxicodendron_) were\r\nsent to me seems to be the same as that which they observed at Kew—only\r\ntwo samples of the leaves sent to me were those of the true poison-ivy.\r\nHence we may conclude that the plant has not been very largely\r\nintroduced in this country, and probably there are not many hundred\r\ncases existing in England of the painful malady which it can, in certain\r\npeople, produce. I have, however, received information of several\r\ninstances of this poisoning from different parts of the country, which\r\nare either now under treatment or have been cured, and in some cases the\r\npoison-ivy has been discovered as the cause, owing to the description\r\nwhich I published. It is certainly true that the illness caused by this\r\nplant only attacks a small proportion of those who handle it, and it is\r\npossible that the plant is more virulent at some seasons and in some\r\nsoils than in others. In the United States, even in the neighbourhood of\r\nNew York, it is a real danger, and is recognised as such, but as appears\r\nfrom a letter which I quote below, the reason of the dread which the\r\n“poison-ivy” excites in the States depends on the fact that it is not\r\nthere a mere garden plant, but grows wild in great abundance in the\r\nwoodlands frequented by holiday-makers and lovers of natural forest and\r\nlakeside wilderness. The poisonous nature of the allied species of\r\n_Rhus_ used for the manufacture of “lacquer” or varnish is recognised by\r\nthe Japanese and others who prepare this product and have to handle the\r\nplant—they wear gloves to protect the hands.\r\n\r\nAs showing what kind of trouble the “poison-ivy” and “poison-oak”\r\n(another kind of _Rhus_ or _Sumach_) give in the United States, I will\r\nquote a letter I have received from an American lady well known in\r\nLondon society. She says: “I have known, suffered, and struggled against\r\nthe poison-ivy in America from my earliest years, when my poor mother\r\nlay for days with blinded and swollen eyes, having gathered it\r\ninadvertently. The ‘poison-ivy,’ as we call it, is a curse to country\r\nlife, outside the purely artificial and cultivated gardens, and even\r\nthere it creeps in insidiously.” She describes a beautiful farm property\r\non Lake Champlain, on the Canadian border, where she and her family\r\nwould spend many weeks in summer in order to enjoy the delights of\r\ncomplete seclusion in wild, unspoilt country: “The one and only drawback\r\nto the place was,” she writes, “the inexhaustible quantity of\r\npoison-ivy. Our first duty had been to teach my two daughters and their\r\ngoverness how to distinguish and avoid contact with it. The one and only\r\nrule was that the poison-ivy has the clusters of three leaflets (the\r\nmiddle leaflet with a longer stalk, _E.R.L._), whereas the woodbine (not\r\nthe English woodbine, which is a convolvulus, _E.R.L._), or, as you\r\ncall it, ‘Virginian creeper,’ has five leaflets in a cluster. Every path\r\nwhich we used frequently and necessarily, such as the path to the\r\nboat-house, and to the cove where the bathing-house stood, we kept\r\ncleared of the _Rhus_ for a sufficient width, but in the woods eternal\r\nvigilance was the price of safety. To uproot and burn is the only way to\r\ndestroy it, but, of course, that involves danger to the one who does the\r\nwork, because contact with the spade used, and with the garments which\r\ntouched the ivy, might communicate the poison. The farmer and the\r\ncountryfolk about declared that the fumes from the burning plant could\r\nand did poison those who breathed them. We used to turn a flock of sheep\r\ninto the most used parts. They prefer the poison-ivy to grass, and\r\ngreedily eat down every leaf within reach in hedge or path. But that, of\r\ncourse, was a mere temporary safety, as the plant is most tenacious of\r\nlife. I personally had a most grievous experience one summer. I can only\r\nsuppose that my dress, though very short for wood and hill walking,\r\nbrushed over the poisonous plant, and then, when I undressed, came into\r\ncontact with my skin. Both legs became covered with the eruption,\r\neventually developing pustules, and the agony of itching, burning, and\r\nsmarting was indescribable. The first remedy applied is usually a\r\nfrequent use of baths of some alkali, generally common soda. With me it\r\nwas altogether inadequate, and the doctor carefully covered the affected\r\nparts with a thick layer of bismuth, and bandaged them, so as to exclude\r\nall air. But it took weeks to cure me. A very serious result in many\r\ncases is that there is a recurrence of the itching for several years.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nPOISONS AND STINGS OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo give an account of poisonous plants would require a whole volume.\r\nAmong plants of every degree and kind are many which produce special\r\nchemical substances which are more or less poisonous, and yet often of\r\nthe greatest value to man when used in appropriate doses, though\r\ninjurious and even deadly if swallowed in large quantity. Plants are\r\nlaboratories which build up in a thousand varieties wonderful chemical\r\nbodies, some crystalline, some oils, some volatile (as perfumes and\r\naromatic substances), some brilliantly coloured (used as dyes), some\r\npungent, some antiseptic, some of the greatest value as food, and some\r\neven digestive, similar to or identical with those formed in the stomach\r\nof an animal.\r\n\r\nMan, the chemist, every year is learning how to produce in his own\r\nlaboratories, from coal and wood refuse, many of these bodies, so as to\r\nbecome to an ever-increasing extent independent of the somewhat\r\ncapricious and costly services of the chemists supplied by nature—the\r\nplants. In a recent exhibition there was a case showing on one side the\r\nvarious essential oils used to make up a flask of eau-de-Cologne, and\r\nspecimens of the plants, flowers, leaves, and fruits from which they\r\nare distilled. On the other side of the case was a series of bottles\r\nshowing the steps in the process by which the modern chemist\r\nmanufactures from coal-tar and coker-butter the same bodies which give\r\nvalue to the vegetable extracts, and there was finally a bottle of what\r\nis called “synthetic eau-de-Cologne”—that is, eau-de-Cologne put\r\ntogether from the products manufactured by the human, instead of the\r\nvegetable, chemist.\r\n\r\nWhilst man has learnt to avoid swallowing poisonous plants, although\r\noccasionally blundering over pretty-looking berries and deceptive\r\nmushrooms, he has had little to fear in that way from animals. To a\r\nsmall degree this is due to the fact that only parts of animals are\r\neaten by man, and those very generally are cooked before being eaten,\r\nthe heating often sufficing to destroy substances present in flesh,\r\nfish, and fowl which would be poisonous if taken raw. But, as a matter\r\nof fact, animals do not generally protect themselves from being eaten,\r\nas plants largely do, by developing nasty or poisonous substances in\r\ntheir flesh, though some do. They fight rather by claws, teeth, and\r\npoison glands therewith connected, or else escape by extra quick\r\nlocomotion, a method not possible to plants. Many insects (butterflies,\r\nbeetles, and bugs), however, produce nasty aromatic substances which\r\ncause animals like birds and lizards to reject them as food. The toad\r\nand the salamander both produce a very deadly poison in their damp, soft\r\nskins, which causes any animal to drop them from its mouth, and to\r\nregret “bitterly” the attempt to swallow them. The frog has no such\r\npoison in its skin, but can jump out of harm’s way. The strong yellow\r\nand black marking of the European salamander is what is called a\r\n“warning” coloration, just as is the yellow and black outfit of the\r\npoisonous wasp. Animals learn to leave the yellow and black livery\r\nuntouched, and the creatures so marked escape the injury which would be\r\ncaused them by tentative bites.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious variation as to susceptibility on the part of man to\r\npoison in the flesh of fishes and shell-fishes when taken by him as\r\nfood. The word “idiosyncrasy” is applied to such individual\r\nsusceptibility, and is, of course, applicable to the susceptibility\r\nshown by some persons to the poison of the American poison-vine,\r\ndescribed in the last article, and of others to acute inflammation from\r\nthe dust of hayfields. Some persons cannot eat lobster, crab, or oysters\r\nor mussels without being poisoned in a varying degree by certain\r\nsubstances present in those “shell-fish” even when cooked. Often a\r\n“rash” is caused on the skin, and colic. Others, again, cannot eat any\r\nfish of any kind without being poisoned in a similar way, or possibly\r\nare only liable to be poisoned by grey mullet or by mackerel. The most\r\ncurious cases of this individual variability are found in the rash and\r\nfever caused by the vegetable drug quinine in rare instances, and the\r\nviolent excitement produced in some persons by the usually soporific\r\nlaudanum. All such cases have very great interest as showing us what a\r\nsmall difference separates an agreeable flavour or a valuable medicine\r\nfrom a rank poison, and how readily the chemical susceptibility of a\r\ncomplex organism like man may vary between toleration and deathly\r\nresponse, without any concomitant indication of such difference being\r\napparent (in our present state of knowledge), in two individuals, to one\r\nof whom that is poison which to the other is meat. They also furnish a\r\nparallel to that marvellous conversion of “toxin” into “anti-toxin,” in\r\nconsequence of which the blood of an animal injected with small,\r\nincreasing doses of deadly snake poison or diphtheria poison becomes an\r\nantidote to the same poison taken into the blood of an unprepared\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThere is, over and above these special cases of fish foods which are\r\ntolerated by some and are poison to others, a whole series of fishes\r\nwhich cannot be eaten by any one without serious poisoning being the\r\nresult, even when the fish are carefully cooked. Happily, these fishes\r\nare rarely, if ever, caught on our own coasts. They produce, when even\r\nsmall bits are eaten, violent irritation of the intestine, and death,\r\nthe symptoms resembling in many respects those of cholera. The curious\r\nbright-coloured, beaked fish of tropical seas and coral reefs, with two\r\nor four large front teeth and spherical spine-covered bodies, and the\r\ntrigger fish of the same regions, are the chief of these poisonous fish.\r\nBut there is a true anchovy on the coast of Japan, and a small herring\r\nin the West Indies, and a goby on the Indian coast (Pondicherry), all of\r\nwhich are deadly poison even when cooked; and there are many others. So\r\none has to be careful about fish-eating in the remoter parts of the\r\nworld. The poisons of these fish with poisonous flesh have not been\r\ncarefully studied, but they seem to resemble chemically the poisons\r\nproduced by certain putrefactive microbes.\r\n\r\nLet us now revert to the more special subject of poisonous stings. Every\r\none knows that although it is unpleasant to be pricked by the little\r\nspines on the leaf of a thistle, it is not the same unpleasantness as\r\nbeing “stung” by a nettle. There is no poison in the thistle. The hairs\r\nwhich beset the leaves of the common nettle are firm, but brittle and\r\nhollow; they break off in the skin, and a poison exudes from their\r\ninterior. Under the microscope—and it is quite easy to examine it with\r\na high power—the hollow nettle hair is seen to be partly occupied by\r\nliving protoplasm—a transparent, viscid substance which shows an active\r\nstreaming movement, and has embedded in it a dense kernel or nucleus\r\n(see Fig. 15 _bis_). It is, in fact, a living “cell,” or life unit. The\r\nspace in the cell not occupied by protoplasm is filled with clear\r\nliquid, which contains the poison. This has been examined chemically by\r\nusing a large quantity of nettle hairs, and is found to contain formic\r\nacid—the same irritating acid which is secreted by ants when they\r\nsting, whence its name. But later observations show that the juice of\r\nthe nettle hair contains also a special poison in minute quantities, an\r\nalbuminous substance, which resembles that contained in the poison-sacs\r\nat the base of the teeth of snakes.\r\n\r\nIn tropical regions there are nettles far more powerful than that of our\r\nown country. The one called _Urtica stimulans_, which is found in Java,\r\nand that called _Laportea crenulata_, found in Hindostan, when bruised\r\nemit an effluvium which poisonously affects the eyes and mouth, and if\r\nhandled produce convulsions and serious swelling and pain in the arms,\r\nwhich may last for three or four weeks, and in some cases cause death.\r\nThey are not unknown in the hothouses of our botanical gardens, and\r\nyoung gardeners are sometimes badly stung by them. There are other\r\nplants provided with poisonous stinging hairs besides the true nettles\r\nor _Urticaceæ_, though they are not numerous. The American plants called\r\n_Loasa_ sting badly, so do some of the Spurges (_Euphorbiaceæ_), and\r\nsome _Hydrophylleæ_.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese primrose (_Primula obconica_), lately introduced into\r\ngreenhouses, has been found to be almost as injurious as the\r\npoison-vine. Its effects, of course, are limited to a much smaller group\r\nof sufferers. And it is worth while, in connection with poisoning by\r\nprimula and the poisoning by _Rhus toxicodendron_ of only certain\r\nindividuals predisposed to its influence, to point out that the malady\r\nknown as hay fever seems to be similar in its character to these\r\nvegetable poisonings. It is, of course, well known that only certain\r\nindividuals are liable to the more violent and serious form of hay\r\nfever. It is not at all improbable that this irritation of the air\r\npassages, often attributed to the mechanical action of the pollen of\r\ngrass and other plants—really is due to minute quantities of a poison\r\nlike that of the poison-vine, present in the pollen of some hay plant\r\nyet to be suspected, tried, and convicted.[2]\r\n\r\nWith regard to a poisonous action at a distance being possibly exerted\r\nby plants, we must not overlook the effects of some perfumes discharged\r\ninto the air by flowers. Primarily such perfumes appear to serve the\r\nflowers by attracting to them special insects, by whose movements and\r\nsearch for honey in the flowers the pollen of one is conveyed to another\r\nand fertilisation effected. Human beings are sometimes injuriously\r\naffected by the heavy perfume given out by lilies and other flowers,\r\nheadache and even fainting being the result. No instance is known of\r\nserious injury or death resulting in the regions where they grow from\r\nthe overpowering perfume of such flowers. But that admirable\r\nstory-teller, Mr. H. G. Wells, has made a legitimate use of scientific\r\npossibilities in imagining the existence of a rare tropical orchid which\r\nattracts large animals to it by its wonderful odour. The effects of the\r\nperfume are narcotising; the animal, having sniffed at the orchid, drops\r\ninsensible at the foot of the tree trunk on which the orchid grows. Then\r\nthe orchid rapidly, with animal-like celerity, sends forth those smooth\r\ngreen fingers or “suckers,” which you may see clinging to the pots and\r\nshelves on which an orchid is growing. As they slowly creep, in their\r\ngrowth, over the poisoned animal, they absorb its life’s blood\r\npainlessly and without disturbing the death-slumber of the victim. Mr.\r\nWells supposes a retired civil-servant, with feeble health and a passion\r\nfor orchids, to have purchased an unknown specimen, which, after some\r\nmonths of nursing, is about to blossom in the little hothouse of his\r\nsuburban home. He goes quietly and alone one afternoon, when his\r\nhousekeeper is preparing his tea, to enjoy the first sight and smell of\r\nthe unknown flower, and is found, some three hours later, lying\r\ninsensible before the orchid, which is giving out an intoxicating odour,\r\nand is looking very vigorous and wicked. A blood-red tint pervades its\r\nleaves and stalks, and it has already pushed some of its finger-like\r\nshoots round the orchid-lover’s neck and beneath his shirt front. When\r\nthey are pulled away a few drops of blood flow from the skin where the\r\nabsorbent shoots had applied themselves. The victim recovers.\r\n\r\nWhen we take a survey of the “stings” and poison-fangs and spurs of\r\nanimals, we find a much greater abundance and variety of these weapons\r\nthan in plants. They serve animals not only as a means of defence, but\r\nvery often for the purpose of attacking and paralysing their prey. We\r\nhave to distinguish broadly between (_a_) gut-poisons and (_b_)\r\nwound-poisons. The slimy surface of the skin and the juices of animals\r\nare often poisonous if introduced into wounds, but harmless if\r\nswallowed, though in the toad and salamander the skin contains a poison\r\nwhich acts on the mouth and stomach. Thus the blood of the eel is\r\npoisonous to higher animals if injected beneath the skin, though not\r\npoisonous when swallowed. Pasteur found that the saliva of a healthy\r\nhuman baby a few weeks old produced convulsions when injected beneath\r\nthe skin of a rabbit. The fluid of the mouth in fishes (_Muræna_), in\r\nsome lizards (_Heloderma_), and some warm-blooded quadrupeds, like the\r\nskunk, is often poisonous, and is introduced into the wound inflicted by\r\na bite. The elaboration of a sac of the mouth-surface secreting a\r\nspecial quantity of poison to be injected by aid of a grooved tooth,\r\nsuch as we find in poisonous snakes, is only a mechanical improvement of\r\nthis more general condition. The same general poisonous quality is found\r\nin the slime of the skins of fishes which have spines by means of which\r\npoisonous wounds are inflicted (sting-rays). And here, too, an\r\nelaboration is effected in some fishes in which a sac is provided for\r\nthe accumulation of the poison, and a specially grooved spine, to convey\r\nthe poison into the wound inflicted by it. A common fish on our coasts,\r\nthe weever (probably the same word as viper), is provided with grooved,\r\nstinging spines, but no special poison-sac. Some of the poison-carrying\r\nspines support the front portion of the dorsal fin, which is of a deep\r\nblack colour, a striking instance of the warning coloration which\r\npoisonous animals often possess.\r\n\r\nThe poison introduced into wounds by the spines or fangs of animals is\r\nessentially similar to that of nettle hairs; it has the effect of\r\nparalysing and of producing convulsions. It is a remarkable fact that\r\nformic acid often in insects accompanies the paralysing poison—as it\r\ndoes in the nettle—and produces intense pain and irritation, which the\r\nmore dangerous nerve-poison does not. Immunity to a given wound-poison\r\nmay be produced by the injection of doses of it, at first excessively\r\nminute, but gradually increased in quantity. A remedial “anti-toxin” is\r\nthus prepared from the blood of immunised animals, which is used as a\r\ncure or as a protection by injecting it into other animals exposed to\r\nbites or wounds conveying the particular poison by the use of which the\r\nanti-toxin was produced. Bee-keepers who have often been stung become\r\nin many cases immune, and do not suffer from bee-sting. Men who in\r\nFrance pursue a business as viper-catchers, are said to become immune to\r\nviper’s poison in the same way. Snakes and scorpions are but little, if\r\nat all, affected by their own poison when it is injected into them. This\r\nappears to be due to the fact that the poison-producing animal is always\r\nabsorbing into its blood very minute doses of the poison which it has\r\nelaborated and stored up in its poison-sac connected with the\r\npoison-gland. This small quantity of poison continually absorbed is\r\ncontinually converted into an anti-toxin—just as happens when a horse\r\nis treated with doses of snake-poison to prepare the remedial anti-toxin\r\nfor use in cases of snake-bite, or with diphtheria-poison in order to\r\nprepare the diphtheria anti-toxin now so largely used. The anti-toxin is\r\na substance very closely similar in chemical constitution to the toxin\r\nby the conversion of which it is formed in the blood. Its action on the\r\ntoxin (or essential poisonous substance of the venom) appears to be a\r\nvery delicate and slight chemical disturbance of the constitution of\r\nthat chemical body. Yet it is enough to cause the injurious quality of\r\nthe toxin to be suddenly and completely abrogated, although from the\r\npoint of view of chemical composition it is only, as it were, shaken or\r\ngiven a twist! Such great practical differences in the action on living\r\ncreatures of chemical bodies having themselves so subtle a difference of\r\nchemical structure as to almost defy our powers of detection, are now\r\nwell known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—Drawing from life of the desert scorpion\r\n(_Buthus australis_, Lin.), from Biskra, N. Africa, of the natural size.\r\n(From Lankester, _Journ. Linn. Soc. Zool._, vol. xvi. 1881.)]\r\n\r\nI made some experiments a few years ago on the poison of scorpions,\r\nwhich were published by the Linnæan Society. I obtained live\r\nscorpions—a beautiful citron-coloured kind, of large size—from Biskra,\r\nin Algeria (Fig. 15). The poison-gland and sac are double, and contained\r\nin the last joint of the tail, which is swollen, and ends in a splendid\r\ncurved spine or sting. The scorpion carries its tail raised in a\r\ngraceful curve over its back, and strikes with the sting by a powerful\r\nforward stroke. One can seize the tail by the last joint but one, and\r\nthus safely hold the animal, and see the poison exude in drops from the\r\nperforated sting. I found that if I pressed the sting thus held into the\r\nscorpion’s own body, or into that of another scorpion, no harm resulted\r\nto the wounded animal, although plenty of the poison entered the little\r\nwound made by the sting. A large cockroach or a mouse similarly wounded\r\nby the sting was paralysed, and died in a few minutes. It is a custom in\r\ncountries where scorpions abound, and are troublesome, and even\r\ndangerous to human life, for the natives to make a circle of red-hot\r\ncharcoal, and to place a large scorpion in the centre of the enclosed\r\narea. The scorpion, it is stated, runs round inside the circle, and,\r\nfinding that escape is impossible, deliberately drives its sting into\r\nits back, and so commits suicide. My experiments showed that the\r\nscorpion could not kill itself in this way, as its poison does not act\r\non itself. Moreover, it has been shown by Professor Bourne, of Madras,\r\nthat although scorpions constantly fight with one another, they never\r\nattempt to use their stings in these battles, but only their powerful,\r\nlobster-like claws. The stings would be useless, and are reserved for\r\ntheir attacks on animals susceptible to the poison. I also found the\r\nground for the belief that the scorpion kills itself when enclosed in a\r\nfiery circle. Incredible as it may appear in regard to such denizens of\r\nthe hot regions of the earth, both the desert scorpion and the large\r\ndark-green Indian scorpions actually faint and become motionless and\r\ninsensible when exposed for a few minutes to a temperature a little\r\nabove that of the human body. This was carefully ascertained by using an\r\nincubator and a thermometer. The scorpion in the fiery circle lashes\r\nabout with its sting, and then suddenly faints owing to the heat. If\r\nremoved from the heat it recovers completely; but, of course, when it is\r\nsupposed to have committed suicide, no one takes the trouble to remove\r\nit. I made, several times, the actual experiment of placing a large\r\nactive scorpion within a ring-like wall, a foot in diameter, formed by\r\nlive coals. The scorpion never stung itself. On one occasion it walked\r\nout over the coals, and on other occasions, after lashing its tail and\r\nrunning about, fainted, and became motionless.\r\n\r\nJelly-fishes are often called “sea-nettles,” because of the microscopic\r\npoison-bearing threads which they discharge from their skin. These are\r\nused to paralyse their prey, and, in a few kinds only, are sufficiently\r\npowerful to cause a “stinging” effect when they come into contact with a\r\nbather’s skin. Sea-anemones are also armed with these minute threads,\r\nand their poison has been extracted and studied. The spines of\r\nstar-fishes and sea-urchins have a very deadly poison associated with\r\nthem, which has recently been examined. Among insects we have the bees,\r\nwasps, and ants, with their terminal stings; caterpillars, with\r\npoisonous hairs; gnats, with poisonous mouth glands. Residents in\r\nmosquito-infested countries become “immune” to the poison of gnat-bite,\r\nbut not to the deadly germs of malaria and yellow fever carried by the\r\ngnats. The centipedes have powerful jaws, provided with poison-sacs; the\r\nspiders have stabbing claws, fitted with poison-glands. Shell-fish, such\r\nas crabs and lobsters, do not possess stings or poison-sacs, but some of\r\nthe whelk-like sea-snails have poison-glands, which secrete a fluid\r\ndeadly to other shell-fish. We have already spoken of the poison-spines\r\nof fishes; among reptiles it is only some of the snakes which are\r\npoisonous, and are known to have poison-glands connected with grooved\r\nfangs. Only one kind of lizard—the Heloderm of North America, already\r\nmentioned—has poison-glands in its mouth, but it has no special\r\npoison-fangs, only small teeth. There is a most persistent and curious\r\npopular error to the effect that the rapidly moving bifid tongue of\r\nsnakes and lizards is a “sting.” It is really quite innocuous. No sting\r\nis known among birds, although some have fighting “spurs” on the leg,\r\nand “claws” on the wing.\r\n\r\nOnly the lowest of the mammals or warm-blooded hairy quadrupeds—namely,\r\nthe Australian duck-mole (_Ornithorhynchus_) and the spiny ant-eater\r\n(_Echidna_)—have poison-glands and related “spurs,” or stings. They\r\nhave on the hind-leg a “spur” of great size and strength, which is\r\nperforated and connected with a gland which produces a poisonous milky\r\nfluid. Recent observations, however, as to the poisonous character of\r\nthis fluid are wanting. Many mammals have large sac-like glands, which\r\nopen by definite apertures, in some cases between the toes, in others\r\nupon the legs, at the side or back of the head (the elephant), in the\r\nmiddle of the back or about the tail. The fluid secreted by these glands\r\nis not poisonous nor acrid, but odoriferous, and seems to serve to\r\nattract the individuals of a species to one another. They resemble in\r\nstructure and often in position the poison-glands of the spurs of the\r\nduck-mole and spiny ant-eater.\r\n\r\nMany insects produce a good deal of irritation, and even dangerous\r\nsores, by biting and burrowing in the human skin, without secreting any\r\nactive poison. Often they introduce microscopic germs of disease in this\r\nway from one animal to another, as, for instance, do gnats,\r\ntsetze-flies, and horse-flies, and as do some small kinds of tics. The\r\nbites of the flea, of midges, gnats, and bugs are comparatively harmless\r\nunless germs of disease are introduced by them, an occurrence which,\r\nthough exceptional, is yet a great and terrible danger. We now know that\r\nit is in this way, and this way only, that malaria or ague, yellow\r\nfever, plague, sleeping-sickness, and some other diseases are carried\r\nfrom infected to healthy men. Various diseases of horses and cattle are\r\npropagated in the same way. The mere bites of insects may be treated\r\nwith an application of carbolic acid dissolved in camphor. The pain\r\ncaused by the acid stings of bees, wasps, ants, and nettles can be\r\nalleviated by dabbing the wound with weak ammonia (hartshorn). Insects\r\nwhich bury themselves in the skin, such as the jigger-flea of the West\r\nIndies and tropical Africa, should be dug out with a needle or fine\r\nblade. The minute creature, like a cheese-mite, which burrows and breeds\r\nin the skin of man and causes the affliction known as the itch must be\r\npoisoned by sulphurous acid—a result achieved by rubbing the skin\r\nfreely with sulphur ointment on two or three successive days. A serious\r\npest in the summer in many parts of England is a little animal known\r\nas the harvest-man. These are the young of a small red spider-like\r\ncreature, called _Trombidium_. They get on to the feet of persons\r\nwalking in the grass, and crawl up the legs and burrow into the tender\r\nskin. Benzine will keep them away if applied to the ankles or stockings\r\nwhen they are about, and will also destroy them once they have effected\r\na lodgment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15 _bis_.—A.

The hard case _e_ is filled with liquid _a_, and is lined with\r\nslimy granular “protoplasm” _b_, which extends in threads across the\r\ncavity to the “nucleus” _c_.

A number of\r\nquite distinct creatures, some living on land, some in sea, are spoken\r\nof in the Bible by a word which is translated as “dragon.” The ancient\r\nWelsh chieftains, like many fighting princes of old days, bore a\r\n“dragon” on their banners, and were themselves called “dragons”\r\n(Pen-dragon), and when a knight slew such a chieftain fabulous stories\r\ngrew up as to his combat with and slaughter of a “dragon.”\r\n\r\nThe complete, legitimate dragon of the present day is the dragon of\r\nheraldry, which is maintained in proper form and with authorised\r\nattributes by the Heralds’ College. I have a drawing of this “official”\r\nbeast before me (Fig. 16). He is represented as of large size, but\r\nwhether theoretically the heralds of to-day consider him to be as large\r\nas a lion or ten times as long and tall I do not know. His body is\r\nlizard-like, and covered with scales resembling those of some lizards\r\n(unlike a crocodile in this respect). His head is not unlike that of a\r\ncrocodile, excepting that he has a short, sharp horn on his nose, and a\r\nbeard on his chin, and also a pair of large pointed ears which no\r\nliving reptile possesses. His mouth is open, showing teeth like those of\r\na crocodile, and from it issues a remarkable tongue, terminating in an\r\narrow-head-shaped weapon (presumably a “sting”) unlike anything known in\r\nany living animal. His tail is very long and snake-like (an important\r\nfact when we come to consider his ancestry), and is thrown into coils.\r\nIt terminates in an arrow-head-shaped structure like that of the tongue,\r\nquite unlike anything known in any real animal. He has four powerful\r\nlimbs, which are not like those of a lizard or a crocodile. They\r\nresemble those of an eagle, and have grasping toes and claws, three\r\ndirected forward and one backward. In addition, he has a pair of wings,\r\nwhich are leathery, and supported by several parallel bars, a structure\r\nwhich gives the wings a remote resemblance to those of a bat. The wing\r\nis quite unlike that of a pterodactyle (the great extinct flying\r\nlizard), and has no resemblance whatever to that of a bird, which is, of\r\ncourse, formed by separate quill feathers set in a row on the bones of\r\nthe fore-arm and hand. The wings are always represented (even in\r\nillegitimate and Oriental dragons) as much too small to carry the dragon\r\nin flight. The dragon has, further, a crest of separate triangular\r\nplates set in a row along the mid-line of his back, extending from his\r\nhead to the end of his tail. Some lizards (but not crocodiles) have such\r\na crest. The most like it is that of the New Zealand lizard, called the\r\n_Sphenodon_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—The heraldic dragon: observe the bat-like\r\nwings, the ears, the horned nose, the beard, the arrow-like tongue and\r\ntail-piece, the scaly body, the dorsal crest, the snake-like tail with\r\nits unnatural arrow-like termination.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—The heraldic griffin. It alone of the\r\ndragon-like monsters has feathery wings.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—Hercules destroying the hydra (copied from an\r\nancient Greek vase).]\r\n\r\nSuch is the creature called “the” dragon. But heraldry recognises some\r\nother terrible beasts allied to the dragon; in fact, what zoologists\r\nwould call “allied species.” The griffin, for instance (Fig. 17), is a\r\nfour-legged beast like the dragon, but has the beak and wings and\r\nforefeet of an eagle, and the hind-legs and tail of a lion. The heraldic\r\nhydra is a dragon, such as I have above described, but with seven heads\r\nand necks. The ancient Greek representation of the hydra destroyed by\r\nHercules (as painted on vases) was, on the contrary, based upon the\r\noctopus, or eight-armed cuttle-fish, each arm carrying a snake-like head\r\n(Fig. 18). The wyvern is an important variety of the dragon tribe, well\r\nknown to heralds, but not to be seen every day. It so far conforms to\r\nnatural laws that it has only two legs, the fore-limbs being the wings\r\n(Fig. 19). The true dragon and the griffin, like the angel of\r\necclesiastical art, have actually six limbs—namely, a pair of fore-legs\r\nor arms, a pair of hind-legs, and, in addition, a pair of wings.\r\nOccasionally an artist (even in ancient Egyptian works of art) has\r\nattempted to avoid this redundance of limbs by representing an angel as\r\nhaving the arms themselves provided with an expanse of quill feathers.\r\nThis is certainly a less extraordinary arrangement than the outgrowth of\r\nwings (which in birds, bats, and pterodactyles actually are the\r\nmodified arms or fore-limbs), as an extra pair of limbs rooted in the\r\nback. The wyvern and the cockatrice and the basilisk (Fig. 20) (which,\r\nlike the Gorgon Medusa, can strike a man dead by the mere glance of the\r\neye) are remarkable for conforming to the invariable vertebrate standard\r\nof no more than two pairs of limbs, whether legs, wings, or fins. The\r\nname “lind-worm” is given to a wyvern without wings (hence the Linton\r\nWorm and the Laidley Worm of Lambton), and appears in various heraldic\r\ndevices and in legendary art; whilst in the arms of the Visconti of\r\nMilan we climb down to a quite simple serpent-like creature without legs\r\nor wings, known as the “guivre.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—The heraldic wyvern.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—The heraldic basilisk, also called the\r\nAmphysian Cockatrice. Observe the second head at the end of its tail—a\r\nfeature due to perversion of the observation that there are some\r\nsnake-like creatures (Amphisbena) with so simple a head that it is at\r\nfirst sight difficult to say which end of the creature is the head and\r\nwhich is the tail.]\r\n\r\nWithout looking further into the strange and fantastic catalogue of\r\nimaginary monsters, one must recognise that it is a matter of great\r\ninterest to trace the origin of these marvellous creations of human\r\nfancy, and the way in which they have first of all been brought into\r\npictorial existence, and then variously modified and finally stereotyped\r\nand maintained by tradition and art. It has not infrequently been\r\nsuggested, since geologists made us acquainted with the bones of huge\r\nand strange-looking fossil reptiles dug from ancient rocks, that the\r\ntradition of “the dragon” is really a survival of the actual knowledge\r\nand experience of these extinct monsters on the part of “long-ago races\r\nof men.” It is a curious fact, mentioned by a well-known writer, Mrs.\r\nJameson, that the bones of a great fossil reptile were preserved and\r\nexhibited at Aix in France as the bones of the dragon slain by St.\r\nMichael, just as the bones of a whale are shown as those of the mythical\r\nDun-cow of Warwick in that city.\r\n\r\nThere are three very good reasons for not entertaining the suggestion\r\nthat the tradition of the dragon and similar beasts is due to human\r\nco-existence with the great reptiles of the past. The first is that the\r\nage of the rocks known as cretaceous and jurassic (or oölitic), in which\r\nare found the more or less complete skeletons of the great\r\nsaurians—many bigger in the body than elephants, and with huge tails in\r\naddition, iguanodon, megalosaurus, diplodocus, as well as the winged\r\npterodactyles (see Plate II., where a representation is given of what we\r\nknow as to the form and bearing of two species of pterodactyle) and a\r\nvast series of such creatures—is so enormously remote that not only man\r\nbut all the hairy warm-blooded animals like him, did not come into\r\nexistence until many millions of years after these rocks had been\r\ndeposited by water and the great reptiles buried in them had become\r\nextinct. The cave-men of the Pleistocene period are modern, even close\r\nto us, as compared with the age when the great saurians flourished. That\r\nwas just before the time when our chalk-cliffs were being formed as a\r\nslowly growing sediment on the floor of a deep sea. No accurate measure\r\nof the time which has elapsed since then is possible, but we find that\r\nabout 200 ft. thickness of deposit has been accumulated since the date\r\nof the earliest human remains known to us—whilst over 5000 ft. have\r\naccumulated since the chalk began to be deposited, and the great\r\nsaurians ceased to exist. If we reckon, in accordance with the most\r\nmoderate estimate, a quarter of a million years for the upper 200 ft. of\r\ndeposit or human period (Pleistocene), we must suppose that twenty or\r\nthirty times as long a period has elapsed to allow time for the deposit\r\nof the 5000 ft. of sand and rock since the great saurians ceased to\r\nexist. This would be some six or seven million years—a long while for\r\ntradition to run, even supposing man existed all that time, which he did\r\nnot. And the probability is that this estimate of the time is far too\r\nsmall: a hundred million years is nearer the truth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE II_\r\n\r\nREAL DRAGONS\r\n\r\nTHE EXTINCT FLYING REPTILES KNOWN AS PTERODACTYLES. THEIR BONES AND WING\r\nMEMBRANES ARE PRESERVED IN THE OOLITIC ROCKS. SOME MEASURED EIGHTEEN\r\nFEET ACROSS THE EXPANDED WINGS.\r\n\r\n_From “Extinct Animals,” by Sir Ray Lankester. (Constable & Co.)_]\r\n\r\nSuppose that man came into existence as an intelligent creature, capable\r\nof handing on a tradition, as much as half a million or even a million\r\nyears before the date of the remains of the earliest cave-men discovered\r\nin Europe, we yet get no long way down the avenue of past time. Man\r\nwould still be separated by millions of years and long ages of change\r\nand development of the forms of animal life on the earth’s surface, from\r\nthe period of the great reptiles or saurians who flourished before the\r\nchalk was deposited. And there is good evidence that none of those great\r\nsaurians survived the date of the chalk. They died out and their place\r\nwas taken by the earliest ancestors of elephants, rhinoceroses, horses,\r\ncattle, lions, and monkeys, from which in the course of ages the animals\r\nwe know by those names were developed, whilst very late in the history\r\nman was produced. The reptiles continued as small, furtive\r\ncreatures—the lizards and a few biggish snakes and crocodiles—but no\r\ndescendants of “the great Dinosaurs” survived.\r\n\r\nAnother reason against the supposed survival of a real tradition of\r\ndragons is that, even in regard to much later—immensely\r\nlater—creatures, such as the mammoth or hairy elephant, which we know\r\nwas contemporary with man, there is no real tradition. The natives of\r\nthe sub-arctic regions in which the skeletons and whole carcases of the\r\nmammoth are found in a frozen state, and from whence many hundreds of\r\ntusks of the mammoth have been since the earliest times yearly exported\r\nand used in Europe as ivory, have no “tradition” of these creatures.\r\nThey have fanciful stories about the ghosts of the mammoths, but they\r\ncall their tusks “horns,” and have no legends of the monster as a living\r\nthing. The use of mammoth’s ivory in Northern Europe dates back for a\r\nthousand years historically, and probably has never ceased since the\r\ndays of the cave-men. Three years ago I examined the richly carved\r\ndrinking horn of a Scandinavian hero, dating from the tenth century, and\r\npreserved amongst the treasures of York Minster, and I have little doubt\r\nthat it is fashioned from the tusk of a mammoth.\r\n\r\nA third reason for rejecting any connection of the dragon with a real\r\nreminiscence of the great extinct saurians is that its origin and its\r\ngradual building up in human fancy can be traced in the same way as that\r\nof many other fanciful and legendary creatures by reference to the\r\nregular operation of the imagination in successive ages of mankind. All\r\nraces of men have imagined monsters by combining into one several parts\r\nof different animals. The centaur of the Greeks is a blend of man and\r\nhorse, the great “divine” chimera of the Greeks was a two-headed blend\r\nof lion and goat, and any such mixed creature is technically called\r\nnowadays “a chimera”. The dragon is classed by heralds as a chimera.\r\nSometimes one of these imaginary beasts has its origin in a terrible or\r\nweird animal, which really exists in some distant land, and is\r\ncelebrated or even worshipped by the inhabitants of that distant land,\r\nwhose descriptions of it are carried in a distorted and exaggerated\r\nform to regions where it does not exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—The Chinese Imperial Dragon, from a drawing on\r\na tile of the old Imperial Palace of Nankin. It has five claws. No one\r\noutside the Imperial service may use it, under penalty of death.\r\nOrdinary people have to be content with a four-clawed dragon. Compare\r\nthis with the European heraldic dragon, Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—A flying snake with two pairs of wings—a\r\n“fabulous” creature thus drawn in an ancient Chinese work, the “Shan Hai\r\nKing.” This book dates from about 350 A.D., but probably is based on\r\nrecords of a thousand years’ earlier date.]\r\n\r\nThe dragon appears to be nothing more nor less in its origin than one of\r\nthe great snakes (pythons), often 25 ft. in length, which inhabit\r\ntropical India and Africa. Its dangerous character and terrible\r\nappearance and movement impressed primitive mankind, and traditions of\r\nit have passed with migrating races both to the East and to the West, so\r\nthat we find the mythical dragon in ancient China and in Japan, no less\r\nthan in Egypt and in Greece. It retains its snake-like body and tail,\r\nespecially in the Chinese and Japanese representations (Figs. 21 and\r\n22); but in both East and West, legs and wings have been gradually added\r\nto it for the purpose of making it more terrible and expressing some of\r\nits direful qualities. Chinese traditions indicate the mountains of\r\nCentral Asia as the home of the dragon, whilst the ancient Greeks\r\nconsidered it to have come from the East. As a matter of fact, the\r\nGreek word “drakon” actually meant plainly and simply a large snake, and\r\nis so used by Aristotle and other writers. There is a beautiful Greek\r\nvase-painting (Fig. 23) showing the dragon which guarded the golden\r\napples of the Hesperides as nothing more than a gigantic snake (without\r\nlegs or wings), coiled round the trunk of the tree on which the apples\r\nare growing (like the later pictures of the serpent on the apple tree in\r\nthe Garden of Eden), whilst the ladylike Hesperides are politely\r\nwelcoming the robust Hercules to their garden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—The dragon guarding the tree in the garden of\r\nthe Hesperides on which grew the golden apples, in quest of which,\r\naccording to Greek legend, the hero Hercules went. The drawing is copied\r\nfrom an ancient Greek vase, and the original includes figures of the\r\nHesperides and of Hercules, not reproduced here.]\r\n\r\nThe worship and propitiation of the serpent is an immensely old form of\r\nreligion (antecedent to Judaism), and exists, or has existed, in both\r\nthe old world and the new. The Egyptians revered a great serpent-god\r\ncalled “Ha-her,” or “great Lord of fear and terror”; to him the wicked\r\nwere handed over after death to be bitten and tortured. The evil spirit\r\nin the Scandinavian mythology was a huge snake—and the connection, not\r\nto say confusion, of the terrible snake with the dragon on the part of\r\nthe early Christians is shown by the words in Revelation xx. 1, 2, “the\r\ndragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan.” The mediæval\r\ndevil with goat’s feet retained the dragon’s tail with its curious\r\ntriangular termination.\r\n\r\nTo the Greeks and Romans snakes were not such very terrible creatures,\r\nsince the kinds found in South Europe are small and harmless—only the\r\nviper being poisonous—and they regarded the serpent as a beneficent\r\ncreature, the familiar of Esculapius the god of medicine, companion of\r\nthe household gods (the Lares), and guardian of sacred places, tombs,\r\nand concealed treasure (Fig. 27). The snake was the special earth-god,\r\nsubterranean in habit, cunning, subtle, and gifted with powers of\r\ndivination. The conception of the serpent as an avenging monster kept\r\ncontinually thrusting itself from the East into the popular mythology of\r\nthe Greeks, and finally led to the building up of the dragon as a winged\r\nand clawed creature distinct from the harmless but cunning snake\r\nfamiliar to them. Even in India there arose a sort of double attitude\r\ntowards the snake (as is not uncommon in regard to deities). On the one\r\nhand he was regarded as all that was terrible, destructive, and evil,\r\nand on the other as amiable, kindly, and wise. The services of the\r\nbeautiful rat-snake in destroying house rats rendered him and his kind\r\nwelcome and valued guests. In Egypt we find representations of small\r\nwinged snakes without legs, and the ancient traveller, Herodotus,\r\nbelieved that they represented real creatures, as did the Roman\r\nnaturalist, Pliny. Very probably the belief in winged snakes is due to\r\nthe similarity of the snake and the eel in general form, since the\r\npaired fins of the eel close to the head (see Figs. 24 and 25)\r\ncorrespond in position with the wings shown in the Egyptian drawings of\r\nwinged serpents. The particular form of winged snake pictured on\r\nEgyptian monuments (see Figs. 26, 27) appears to me to be a realisation\r\nof stories and fancies based on real experience of the locust. It was\r\nthe terrible and destructive locust of which Herodotus tells—calling it\r\n“a winged serpent.” The Egyptian pictures of winged serpents have wings\r\nresembling those of an insect (see Figs. 26 and 27), and sometimes they\r\nare represented with one and sometimes with two pairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—A votive tablet (ancient Rome) showing what is\r\nmeant for a snake, but has been “improved” by the addition of fins like\r\nthose of the eel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—Ancient Roman painting of a so-called marine\r\nserpent—really an eel-like fish—inaccurately represented. The fins\r\nshow how, from such pictures, the belief in winged serpents might take\r\nits origin.]\r\n\r\nAristotle says that, as a matter of common report in his time, there\r\nwere winged serpents in Africa. Herodotus, on the contrary, says there\r\nwere none except in Arabia, and he went across the Red Sea from the city\r\nof Bats in order to see them. He did not, however, succeed in doing so,\r\nthough he says he saw their dead bodies and bones. He says that they\r\nhang about the trees in vast numbers, are of small size and varied\r\ncolour, and that they are kept in check by the bird known as the Ibis,\r\nwhich on that account is held sacred, since they increase so rapidly\r\nthat unless devoured they would render it impossible for man to maintain\r\nhimself on the earth. They invade Egypt in swarms, flying across the Red\r\nSea. All this agrees with my suggestion that the winged “serpents” heard\r\nof by Herodotus were really locusts; and the creature drawn in Fig. 27\r\nmay well be a locust transformed by fancy into a winged snake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—Egyptian four-winged serpent—as drawn on\r\nancient Egyptian temples.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—Two-winged serpent, symbolic of the goddess\r\nEileithya, from a drawing on an Egyptian temple.]\r\n\r\nIt would be a very interesting but a lengthy task to trace out the\r\norigin and history of the various traditional monsters, such as the\r\nbasilisk, the gorgon, the cockatrice, the salamander, and the epimacus,\r\nwhich have come into European legend and belief, and to give some\r\naccount of the special deadly qualities of each. St. Michael and St.\r\nGeorge slaughtering each his dragon and rescuing a lovely maiden from\r\nits clutches are only appropriations by the new religion of the similar\r\ndeeds ascribed to Greek heroes, such as Hercules, Bellerophon, and\r\nPerseus. Often a belief in the existence of a monster has arisen by a\r\nmisunderstanding, on the part of a credulous people, of a drawing or\r\ncarving showing a strange mixture of the leading characteristics of\r\ndifferent animals, which was meant by the man who made it to be only\r\nsymbolic of a combination of qualities. Just as the Latins and mediæval\r\npeople credulously accepted Greek symbolic monsters as real, and\r\ntransmuted Greek heroes into Christian saints, so were the Greeks\r\nthemselves deluded by strange carvings and blood-curdling legends which\r\nreached them at various dates from mysterious Asia into a belief in the\r\nactual existence of a variety of fantastic monsters. “The Greeks,” says\r\nM. E. Pottier, a distinguished French writer on Greek mythology, “often\r\ncopied Oriental representations without understanding them.” The\r\nconventional dragon probably came from Indian sources through Persia to\r\nChina, on the one hand, spreading eastwards, and to the Latins of the\r\nearly Roman Empire, on the other hand, spreading westwards; but at what\r\ndate exactly it is difficult to make out.\r\n\r\nIn mediæval, as well as in earlier times, marvellous beasts were brought\r\ninto imaginary existence by the somewhat unscrupulous enterprise of an\r\nartist in giving pictorial expression to the actual words by which some\r\ntraveller described a strange beast seen by him in a foreign land. Thus\r\nthe “unicorn,” which was really the rhinoceros, was seen by travellers\r\nin the earliest times, and was described as an animal like a horse, but\r\nwith a single horn growing from its forehead. The heraldic draughtsman\r\naccordingly takes the spirally twisted narwhal’s tusk, brought from the\r\nnorthern seas by adventurous mariners (the narwhal being called “the\r\nunicorn fish”) as his unicorn’s horn, and plants it on the forehead of a\r\nhorse, and says, “Behold! the unicorn.” Meanwhile the real “unicorn,”\r\nthe rhinoceros, became properly known as navigation and Eastern travel\r\nextended, and true unicorns’ horns, the horns of the rhinoceros, richly\r\ncarved and made into drinking cups, not at all like the narwhal’s tusk,\r\nwere brought to Europe from India. One was sent to Charles II. by “the\r\nGreat Sophy,” and handed over to the Royal Society by the King for\r\nexperiment. These horns were asserted to be the most powerful antidote\r\nor destroyer of poison, and a test for the presence of poison in drink.\r\nThere was no truth whatever in the assertion, as the Royal Society at\r\nonce showed. Yet they were valued at enormous prices, and pieces were\r\nsold for their weight in gold. A German traveller in the time of Queen\r\nElizabeth saw one which was kept among the Queen’s jewels at Windsor,\r\nand was valued, according to this writer, at £10,000.\r\n\r\nCredulity, fancy, and hasty judgment are accountable for the belief in\r\nmythical and legendary monsters. Yet they have great interest for the\r\nscientific study of the growth of human thought and of the relationships\r\nof the races of mankind. They are often presented to us in beautiful\r\nstories, carvings, or pictures, having a childlike sincerity and a\r\nconcealed symbolism which give to the wondrous creatures charm and human\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nOYSTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nOysters are delicate morsels—still appreciated by that class of the\r\npopulation which nevertheless shudders at the thought of eating the\r\nhigh-flavoured “whilk” or the gristly “periwinkle,” and neglects the\r\nadmirable mussel, so rightly valued by our French friends. There are a\r\nnumber of interesting facts about the nature and life-history of\r\noysters, and the different kinds of them—a knowledge of which does not\r\ndiminish, but, on the contrary, rather adds to the pleasure with which\r\none swallows the shell-fish. I remember the time when “natives” were\r\nsold in London at sixpence the score. When I was a schoolboy at St.\r\nPaul’s they were no more than sixpence a dozen at the best shops in\r\nCheapside. That inevitable form of British enterprise which is known as\r\n“monopoly,” many years since laid hold of the oyster business, and\r\nrapidly raised the price of the best natives to eight times what it had\r\nbeen, while the typhoid “scare” came subsequently as a sort of poetical\r\njustice, and threatened to ruin the oyster monopolists. As a matter of\r\nfact, there is no difficulty in freeing oysters from any possible\r\ncontamination by the typhoid germ. They have only to be kept for ten\r\ndays or a fortnight in large tanks of sea-water of unquestionable\r\npurity—after removal from the fattening grounds (tanks or waterways),\r\nand they rid themselves of any possible infection. It is the interest of\r\nthe oyster merchant to make sure that this treatment is strictly\r\nenforced. It is a noteworthy fact that the anciently established habit\r\nof drenching an oyster with vinegar before eating it is precisely the\r\nbest treatment, except cooking them, which could have been adopted in\r\norder to destroy the vitality of typhoid germs—although the existence\r\nof such germs was unknown when the practice arose, and vinegar or\r\nlemon-juice was taken with uncooked oysters as a matter of taste, not as\r\na safeguard.\r\n\r\nThe oyster is sometimes grandiloquently styled “the succulent\r\nmollusc”—and it is classed together with other bivalve shells and true\r\n“shell-bearing” shell-fish, such as whelks and snails (not lobsters and\r\ncrabs, which are Crustacea), in a great division of animals known to\r\nnaturalists as the Mollusca. This word is only a Latin form of the name\r\n_Malakia_, which was given to the cuttle-fishes by that wonderful man\r\nAristotle, the Greek—and means “soft creatures.” A bivalve, or\r\ntwo-shelled mollusc, like the oyster, may be compared to an oblong\r\nnotebook. The hard covers correspond to the two shells and the back to a\r\nhorny piece by which the two shells are united, forming the hinge. If\r\nyou place a piece of indiarubber (a thickish bit) between the covers of\r\nthe notebook so that it lies near the back, and then try to shut the\r\nbook, you find that it requires some pressure to do so; when you leave\r\noff pressing them the covers gape. The horny hinge-piece or ligament of\r\nthe shells of the oyster and other bivalves acts in this way. The shells\r\nare only kept closed by a strong muscle, which runs across from shell to\r\nshell (Figs. 28 and 30_m_). When the oyster is at rest or when it is\r\ndead the muscle does not act, and the elastic hinge-piece or ligament\r\ncauses the shells to gape. The animal within the shells may be compared\r\nto the leaves of the notebook. Suppose there are twenty-six leaves, then\r\nthe outermost leaf on each side corresponds to the two soft living\r\nmembraneous flaps which secrete the two shells or covers of the oyster\r\nand lie closely on them (_a_, _b_, Figs. 28 and 30); the next two on\r\neach side (rather shortened leaves, folded in from below) are the flat\r\ngills or “gill-plates” of the mollusc (_g^1_ to _g^4_ in Fig. 28);\r\nwhilst we must suppose the twenty middle leaves to be “pulped” and fused\r\ntogether to represent the body of the shell-fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—An oyster with the right-side shell removed;\r\n_c_, the pearly inner surface of the left-side shell; _d_, the horny\r\nouter layer projecting beyond _c_; _a_, the thick edge of the\r\n“mantle”-flap of the left side; _b_, the thick edge of the mantle-flap\r\nof the right side thrown back towards the centre, so as to show what\r\nunderlies it; _e_, notch in the surface (pulled a little upwards and\r\nforwards) where the ligament is formed; _h_, the hinge surface, where\r\nthe removed shell rested on the left-side shell; _g^1_ to _g^4_, the\r\nfour gill-plates or flaps, two right, two left—the so-called beard;\r\n_l_, the four corresponding lip lobes: the mouth lies deeply between the\r\nsecond and third—that is between the right pair and the left pair; _m_,\r\nthe central shell-muscle, which runs from one shell to the other.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—Part of a row of the lashing hairs or “cilia”\r\nwhich cover the gills of the oyster. This represents part of a single\r\nrow, only the 1/400th of an inch long from one end to the other. The\r\nwhole surface of the gill and other parts is beset with these hairs, not\r\nin single rows, but closely, as the hairs of fur are set. The drawing is\r\nintended to show the way in which the hairs actively bend downwards (or\r\n“lash”), and then rise up again in regular waves, the movement or wave\r\npassing along in the same way as a wave of bending and returning to the\r\nupright passes over a ripe cornfield when a light breeze blows across it\r\n(see also Fig. 40).]\r\n\r\nThe oyster’s gill-plates, commonly called “the beard,” are covered on\r\nthe surface by microscopic hairs of a very remarkable kind (Fig. 29).\r\nThey are soft, living protoplasm, and are continually “lashing,” bending\r\nforwards and straightening again at the rate of some three or four\r\nhundred strokes to the minute. They all work rhythmically together, and\r\nproduce a strong current in the water, which bathes the surface of the\r\noyster when the shells are open. Such microscopic vibrating hairs are\r\nvery common in aquatic animals, and are called “cilia.” The current\r\nwhich they produce causes oxygen-holding water to flow from without over\r\nthe gills, and so aerate the blood of the oyster, and also carries into\r\nthe chamber protected by the shells excessively minute particles,\r\nchiefly microscopic plants, which are driven on to the small, open mouth\r\nof the oyster, placed far up on its body. These microscopic\r\nfood-particles are wafted down the oyster’s throat by similar vibrating\r\nhairs into the stomach and intestine. An oyster has no other means of\r\ntaking food, and almost without cessation, as the oyster lies on the sea\r\nbottom with its muscle relaxed and its shell “gaping,” the nourishing\r\nstream is kept going. If poisonous matter, bad water, or some violent\r\ndisturbance make themselves apparent, the shell-muscle acts, and the\r\noyster tightly closes his shell. Such things make themselves “apparent”\r\nto the oyster, for it has a nervous system, and though it has no eyes\r\n(the nearly allied “scallop” has a number of eyes) it has a delicate\r\nsense of smell and touch, and also what is usually considered to be an\r\norgan of hearing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.—The animal of an oyster removed from the shell:\r\n_a_, the thick edge of the left side mantle-flap or skirt; _b_, same of\r\nthe right side; _l_, position of the mouth; _m_, shell-muscle or\r\nadductor-muscle, bringing the two shells tightly together when it\r\ncontracts.]\r\n\r\nThe oyster has also a heart and blood-vessels (Fig. 30) and blood; in\r\nsome few bivalves and snails the blood is red like our own. The beating\r\nof the heart may be seen by careful examination of a freshly opened\r\nspecimen. The oyster has also a “liver,” or digestive gland, and a\r\nkidney and a soft, branched, tubular structure embedded in the body,\r\nwithin which the egg-cells and sperm-cells grow by means of which the\r\noyster propagates itself in the summer. Our north European oyster\r\nproduces in the same individual both egg-cells, and the male fertilising\r\nsperm-cells or spermatozoa. The eggs are just visible to the unaided eye\r\n(Fig. 31), and as many as a million are produced in the warm breeding\r\nseason by a single ripe oyster. About a fortnight after the eggs have\r\nbeen shed, the same tubular chambers in the oyster’s body which produced\r\nthe eggs by growth from their inner walls, produce the spermatozoa, so\r\nthat they are too late to fertilise the eggs of the same oyster. They\r\npass out of the oyster into the sea water, and are carried within the\r\nshelter of the shells, and so on to the surface of the protected bodies\r\nof other neighbouring oysters by the currents created by the “ciliated”\r\ngill-plates of these neighbours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.—The eggs of the oyster—taken from a ripe\r\nindividual—magnified 500 times linear.]\r\n\r\nThe sperm particles or spermatozoa (Fig. 32) are produced by millions,\r\nand form a cloud finer than dust in the sea water. They are carried\r\nwithin the shells of both egg-producing and sperm-producing oysters, and\r\nare driven along into the openings of the tubular reproductive sacs,\r\nand into those sacs in the case of those oysters which are at the time\r\nproducing eggs. There they fertilise the eggs. The minute eggs begin to\r\ndevelop whilst still within the parent’s body, and continue to do so\r\nwhilst remaining within the shelter of the shell, adhering to the\r\ngill-plates (Fig. 33). In a day or two each fertilised egg has developed\r\ninto a very minute creature, provided with a tiny circlet of cilia or\r\nvibratile hairs, the movements of which cause it to swim (Fig. 33F). The\r\nparent oyster is now said to be “white-sick.” In the course of a couple\r\nof days the young oyster still within its parent’s shell becomes dark in\r\ncolour, and has formed on its surface a pair of symmetrical shells, not\r\nlike those of an adult oyster, but convex (Fig. 34) like those of a clam\r\nor a cockle. The head region, with its circlet of vibrating cilia, can\r\nbe projected between the open shells or withdrawn between them when the\r\nshells are shut. The mother oyster, laden with these little dark specks,\r\nis now said to be “black-sick.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.—The sperms or spermatozoa of a ripe oyster, as\r\nseen swimming in a drop of sea water: magnified 2000 times linear.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.—Development of the egg of the common oyster,\r\nafter fertilisation within the tubular passage of the reproductive sacs.\r\nA, surface view.

The outline of the right-side shell is seen, and the foot, _ft_,\r\nbetween the mouth, _m_, and the anus, _a_. The stomach, _st_, and the\r\nintestine, _e_, show by transparency.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of a week or so the brood of dark young oysters escapes by\r\nthousands from the parent’s shell into the surrounding water. They swim\r\nby their circlet of vibrating hairs, or “velum,” as it is called,\r\ntowards the surface, and are carried far and wide by the tides. They are\r\nactive, transparent little “dots,” very unlike their parent (Fig. 34).\r\nThe next thing that happens to them—after a few days, perhaps weeks—is\r\nthat owing to the increasing weight of their shells, they sink to the\r\nbottom. More than half perish by dropping thus on to bad ground; a\r\nvast number have already been eaten by young fishes and shrimps. Those\r\nwhich are lucky enough to fall on to something hard—stones, rocks, old\r\noyster-shells, or the shells of living oysters—become cemented to those\r\nhard substances by the new shelly substance formed by the growing edge\r\nof the lowermost of their little shells, which now spread out, lose\r\ntheir cockle-like shape as they grow, and become, the one (the left by\r\nwhich it is fixed) large, deep, and bossed, the other flat. The little\r\noysters are only one-fortieth of an inch in diameter when first they\r\nbecome fixed, but they grow rapidly, feeding in the same way as their\r\nparents. Vast numbers are eaten by other animals. In some localities in\r\ntwo years, in others in three years, they have grown to a couple of\r\ninches in length, and now produce in the summer breeding season a\r\ncertain quantity of eggs and sperm to start new generations. The oyster\r\ncontinues to grow, and at five to seven years of age is in full vigour\r\nand maturity; at ten years of age it produces few eggs, or sperm-cells;\r\nand in the course of another year or so, under natural conditions, dies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.—Free-swimming young oyster or oyster-larva,\r\nshowing the head, with its tuft of cilia projecting from between the two\r\nshells, _l_ and _r_.]\r\n\r\nEnormous as is the output of young by a single oyster—amounting to\r\nsomething like a million a year in probably four or five successive\r\nyears—yet it must be remembered that on the whole, taking all the\r\nvarious oyster-beds into account, some of which increase whilst others\r\ndwindle or actually die out altogether, there is no increase in the\r\noyster population of the seas. Taking them all round, five million young\r\noysters start life in order that one may finally come to maturity, so\r\nmany and varied and incessant are the dangers, the predatory enemies,\r\nthe destructive effects of cold currents, bad ground, and other chances\r\nof life and death on to which the swarming swimming young are launched.\r\n\r\nThe above brief history applies to the North Sea or Channel oyster,\r\nwhich is also found (with other species) in the Mediterranean. The\r\nAmerican and the Portuguese oyster differ from it in being of distinct\r\nsexes, and in the fact that the eggs are discharged into the sea by the\r\nfemales, and are there fertilised by the sperm discharged by the male\r\noysters, instead of in the parent’s body.\r\n\r\nOther “molluscs,” such as snails and whelks, enclose their fertilised\r\neggs, when they lay them, in egg-shells. Some snails enclose a single\r\negg in a shell which is filled up with clear liquid—corresponding to\r\nthe “white” of a bird’s egg—in which the egg floats and develops. The\r\neggs of the common snail are not bigger than a hemp-seed, but some\r\nIndian snails lay eggs as big as those of a robin, with a hard,\r\ncalcareous shell, and the young snail has quite a large coiled shell of\r\nits own before it escapes from the egg-shell. So that it looks, when one\r\nof the big snail’s eggs is broken, as though a snail had managed to get\r\ninside a bird’s egg without making a hole in it! The whelks and their\r\nkind lay many eggs in one shell or capsule, and the sea-slugs produce a\r\nsort of firm jelly, in cords like vermicelli, the jelly enclosing\r\nhundreds of little sacs filled with liquid, in which the true germs or\r\nfertilised egg-cells float. These are all methods for protecting the\r\nyoung in their earliest condition. One of our pond-snails—the\r\n_Paludina_—keeps her eggs, whilst they develop, inside the dilated end\r\nof the tube which leads from the egg-producing organ or ovary to the\r\nexterior. The young snails nearest the opening to the exterior are the\r\nfurthest advanced in development, and are as big as a dried pea. All\r\nstages, from the minute germ just fertilised to well-formed young, may\r\nbe found in these snails, and the whole course of their development and\r\ngradual change and growth can be minutely studied with the microscope in\r\none specimen.\r\n\r\nSimilar devices for protecting the young in their earliest helpless\r\nstages of growth from the egg-shell are found in all classes of animals.\r\nWhat is very curious is the fact that, of two closely allied animals,\r\none species will recklessly lay its eggs and leave them, whilst another\r\nhas special arrangements for retaining in the parent’s body the eggs as\r\nthey develop, and so preserving them from danger. Such parents are\r\ncalled “viviparous.” Of course, in all viviparous animals, as well as in\r\nthose which lay their eggs in hard shells, the fertilisation of the egg\r\nmust be effected within the maternal body. Amongst our common fishes\r\nthere is the viviparous blenny, often found in pools at low tide on the\r\nseashore. All the other British fresh-water and marine fishes lay their\r\neggs and abandon them, excepting some sharks, dog-fish, and skates,\r\nwhich are viviparous; others of the shark and skate tribe lay eggs of\r\nlarge size encased in hard, horny shells. Every one knows that frogs and\r\ntoads lay their eggs, but there are some kinds in which the eggs remain\r\ninside the mother’s body during the development of the young, which only\r\nescape into the world as well-formed little frogs. All the hairy,\r\nwarm-blooded quadrupeds known as “the mammals” are viviparous, except\r\nthe duck-mole and the spiny ant-eater of Australia. These extraordinary\r\nlittle “beasts” lay eggs like those of a bird.\r\n\r\nThe most ingenious devices for the protection of the young are (as\r\nperhaps those who believe in the superior intelligence of the male\r\nwould expect) put into practice by the male parent. Thus, there is a\r\nlarge fish in tropical rivers which takes the eggs laid by the female\r\ninto his capacious mouth, and swims about with them for three or four\r\nweeks, giving them the advantage of a current of water which runs\r\nthrough his mouth to his gills. When the young hatch they swim out of\r\ntheir fond father’s mouth. The male of pipe-fishes and of the little\r\n“sea-horse” receives the eggs laid by the female into a pouch excavated\r\nalong his ventral surface. There the young hatch, and are guarded by the\r\nnursing father. On the other hand, some fathers impartially eat their\r\nown young, as well as those of other parents, and the mother has a hard\r\njob to protect her offspring. A female octopus (the poulp or eight-armed\r\ncuttle-fish) sits over her eggs in a nest built of pebbles at the bottom\r\nof the sea (or of an aquarium tank in the instance studied by me many\r\nyears ago at Naples), and squirts a stream of pure sea-water over them.\r\nShe resents the approach of a fish or a crab or a landing-net with\r\nsplendid fury and recklessness of attack. Often the males of fishes,\r\nfrogs, and birds guard the eggs, or guard the nest where the female is\r\noccupied in caring for the eggs or the young.\r\n\r\nThere are various species of oysters common in all parts of the world\r\nwhich are eaten as delicacies. Primeval (Neolithic) man ate oysters (the\r\ncommon sort) in Denmark in enormous quantity—great heaps of the\r\ndiscarded oyster-shells are found, buried among which are discovered\r\nstone axe-heads and bits of rude pottery. In the West Indies travellers\r\nrelate that the oysters “climb” the trees which overhang the water of\r\nquiet creeks and inlets of the sea. The fact is that the branches of the\r\nmangrove trees dip into the water, and the young oyster “spat” attaches\r\nitself to the immersed twigs. After a year or two, the tree grows\r\nvigorously, and raises its branches up in its growth, so that the\r\noysters are carried far up above the sea waves. Of course they die under\r\nthese conditions, but their position suggests the explanation that the\r\noysters have climbed up the trees. Ship barnacles fix themselves,\r\nsimilarly, to the twigs of willow trees in the quiet sea lochs of the\r\nWest of Scotland, and this led 500 years ago to the belief that the\r\ncatkins of the willow tree ripen into barnacles. Since it was also held\r\nthat the little animal of the barnacle hatches out of its shell as a\r\nyoung goose—the so-called “barnacle goose”—the marvellous story was\r\nbelieved that these geese are actually budded from willow trees. I\r\nbelieve that the supposed relationship of the goose and the ship’s\r\nbarnacle arose solely from the accidental similarity of the names of the\r\ntwo animals—the “bernack” goose and the sea “barnacle” being names of\r\nindependent origin. The names were different originally in sound and\r\nsignification, but were corrupted by fisher-folk into one and the same\r\nword. Hence a fantastic fable took its growth.\r\n\r\nIn Paris you may test and compare several local varieties of the common\r\noyster in a celebrated oyster-shop. There are Courseilles, Cancales,\r\nMarennes, Ostend, Zeeland, Arcachon, English natives, Côtes Rouges (red\r\nbanks), and Black Rocks. And you can eat sea-urchins there, too, if you\r\nwish. They have not, however, got the celebrated oysters from the Lake\r\nFusaro, near Naples. This was the ancient _Acherusia palus_, and in the\r\nneighbouring Lake Avernus and the Lucrine lake oysters were cultivated\r\nby the ancient Romans, the young oysters being made to affix themselves\r\nat “the fall of the spat” to wooden “stands” or frames, which were then\r\nplaced in the lake (a salt-water lake), where they had abundant minute\r\nvegetable food and grew large and fat. The same cultivation, with the\r\nsame shape of “stands,” is carried on at the present day in the Lake\r\nFusaro. My friend, Mr. Günther, of Magdalen College, Oxford, has\r\npublished pictures of Roman tiles from this neighbourhood showing the\r\noysters adhering in rows to the wooden frames. These tiles were\r\napparently sold to holiday visitors in the time of the Roman emperors as\r\na memento of a happy day spent at the Lucrine lake, just as a sugar\r\nbasin or a mug is now sold at our seaside resorts with the inscription,\r\n“A present from Margate,” or Southport, or Blackpool, and the picture of\r\na shrimp above it.\r\n\r\nThe care of the breeding oyster and the plans adopted by the owners of\r\noyster-beds for catching the “spat,” or young oysters, when they fall to\r\nthe bottom, by placing movable tiles or frames for them to fix\r\nthemselves to, form an important part of the craft of the oyster-man. It\r\nis a difficult business, and is variously carried out in England,\r\nFrance, Holland, and America. The young oysters, when they have fixed\r\nthemselves, are carried on the movable tiles or frames from one region\r\nto another for the purpose of encouraging their growth and avoiding a\r\nvariety of dangers to their life and health (sometimes from the Bay of\r\nBiscay to the mouth of the Thames!). They are often—but not\r\nalways—finally fed up in sea-ponds or inlets, which are peculiar in\r\ncontaining an enormous number of those very minute microscopic plants,\r\nwith beautifully shaped siliceous shells, which are known as diatoms.\r\nThese are so abundant in such ponds as to form a sort of powder or cloud\r\nnear the bottom, and the oysters draw them, day and night, by their\r\ngill-currents into their mouths, digest them, and grow fine and fat. The\r\ndistrict of Marennes, on the west coast of France, is celebrated for\r\nhaving sea-ponds or tanks in which a wonderful diatom of a bright blue\r\ncolour abounds; so abundant are they that the cloud produced by them\r\nin the pools is of a deep cobalt-blue. When oysters are placed in these\r\ntanks to fatten, their gills or beards become rich blue-green in colour.\r\nThey lose the colour after ten days, when removed to ordinary tanks.\r\nThese are the celebrated green oysters or “Marennes vertes” of French\r\nrestaurants. The colouring matter of the little diatoms—swallowed by\r\nthe million and digested—is taken up by the blood of the oyster from\r\nits stomach, and is excreted by certain corpuscles on the surface of the\r\ngills—as I showed some twenty-five years ago—just as red madder is\r\ndeposited in the bones of a pig fed upon madder, and as the feathers of\r\nthe canary take up the colour of cayenne pepper when it is mixed with\r\nthe canary’s food. It used to be thought that the green colour of the\r\ngreen oyster is due to copper—and that opinion was supported by the\r\ncurious fact that the blood of all oysters and other molluscs, and also\r\nof lobsters, scorpions, and king-crabs, does really contain a minute\r\nquantity of copper, just as our blood contains iron! It was also\r\nsupported by the fact that occasionally a fraudulent fishmonger, when\r\nasked to supply green oysters, has been convicted of colouring the\r\nbeards of ordinary oysters with green copper salt, so as to imitate the\r\nreal article! The real history of the green-bearded oysters is now quite\r\ncertain, and any one interested in the matter should look at the\r\ncoloured pictures of the beautiful little blue-coloured _Navicula\r\nostrearia_—the diatom on which this oyster feeds, published by me in\r\nthe _Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science_ in 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nMATERNAL CARE AND MOLLUSCS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American and Portuguese species of oysters, which are called\r\nrespectively _Ostrea virginiana_ and _Ostrea angulata_, as opposed to\r\nthe common oyster, which is known as _Ostrea edulis_, are not\r\nhermaphrodite like the latter, but have distinct males and females.\r\nMoreover, the young are not fertilised within the parent’s body, nor do\r\nthey pass their earliest stages of growth within the parent’s shell\r\nadhering to the “beard,” or gills, as in the common oyster. The eggs\r\n(Fig. 31) are, on the contrary, discharged by the females into the sea,\r\nand at the same time the males discharge a cloud of microscopic sperm\r\nfilaments, or spermatozoa (Fig. 32), which dart about in the water and\r\nfertilise the eggs. That is a more prodigal and less certain process\r\nthan that pursued by the common oyster. The American and Portuguese\r\noyster have to pay for it. The female produces in one season not a\r\nmillion eggs, as does the common oyster, but nine millions. And out of\r\nevery fifty million so produced (in some five or six years) only a\r\nsingle male and a single female individual, taking the whole oyster\r\npopulation of these species into consideration, survive to maturity.\r\n\r\nThis enormous excess of egg-production in order to ensure the survival\r\nof a single pair to replace their parents is a very frequent thing in\r\naquatic animals. But there are many devices by which the necessity for\r\nsuch lavish scattering of a new brood is avoided. The common oyster is\r\nalready a step in advance of the American in this matter, since it\r\nprotects its young in the very earliest stages within the shelter of its\r\nshell. A further advance in this direction is found in the fresh-water\r\nmussels (not to be confused with the very different sea-mussels, since\r\nthey are bitter and tough, and quite inedible, though used as bait in\r\nsea-fishing). The pond-mussel (_Anodon_) and the river-mussel (_Unio_)\r\nare of distinct sexes, and the gills of the female become swollen up at\r\nthe breeding season so as to form two large bags, into which the eggs\r\nare laid by her, as many as 500,000 in number. They are fertilised by\r\nthe sperm filaments discharged by the males, which are carried into the\r\nfemale’s shell by currents produced by the vibrating hairs on the gills,\r\nas in the common oyster. But the young remain much longer in the\r\nmussel’s gills than do the young oysters in those of their parent’s.\r\nLate in the season you find the bag-like gills of the female pond- and\r\nriver-mussels full of extraordinary little creatures one-thirtieth of an\r\ninch long, each provided with a pair of triangular shells. They are\r\ndischarged into the water, and swim very actively by rapidly opening and\r\nshutting the little shells (Fig. 35). The common scallop (_Pecten_, or\r\nPilgrim’s shell) swims every now and then in the same way as do these\r\nyoung mussels, and so do some other bivalves. The young fresh-water\r\nmussels produce a long, sticky thread, which trails from the shell (Fig.\r\n35 _by_). Very few have the good chance to get further on in life than\r\nthis stage, for all depends on their stumbling across fish—a\r\nstickleback, or a perch, or a pike—as they blindly snap their shells\r\nand wobble through the water. The lucky triangular mite whose sticky\r\nthread happens to touch a fish’s body becomes immediately fastened by\r\nit to the fish and then grips the skin with its snapping shells, the\r\nedges of which are provided with a few long, sharp teeth. The fish\r\nprobably is quite unaware of the lodgment of the young mussel on its\r\nskin, but there it remains, and gets buried for a time in the soft\r\ntissues of the fish, becoming thus actually a parasite for some two or\r\nthree months during the winter season. It nourishes itself on the juices\r\nof the fish, and grows to the size of a pin’s head, whilst it is carried\r\naway from its birthplace by the peregrinations of its host, the fish.\r\nIts shell now ceases to be triangular, and becomes like that of its\r\nparents. Eventually the young mussel drops off the fish and rests on the\r\nmuddy bottom of pond or river, where it remains for many years, growing\r\nvastly in size, and barely moving during its long life from the spot\r\nwhere it fell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.—Young of the pond-mussel after escaping from\r\nthe maternal gill-pouch: A, as it escapes, swimming by opening and\r\nshutting the shells; _sh_, shell of one side; _al_, shell-muscle; _t_,\r\nteeth of the shell’s edge; _by_, adhesive filament.

(From drawings by the late\r\nFrank Balfour.)]\r\n\r\nA beautiful little bivalve common in weedy streams in England is known\r\nas _Cyclas_ (it has no English name); it has a pair of shells shaped\r\nlike those of a cockle, but smooth, and only half as big as one’s\r\nlittle finger-nail. The nursing of the young in the gill-sacs is carried\r\nto a much further point by _Cyclas_ than by the pond- or river-mussel.\r\nBefore they are ejected by the parent they are quite large—like their\r\nparent in appearance, and half as big as a hemp-seed. Necessarily there\r\nare not many produced in a season—there is not room for more than\r\ntwenty or thirty young in the gill-sacs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE HEART’S BEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beat of the heart is one of those great and elemental features of\r\nman’s life which, in spite of our familiarity with it and its momentary\r\nrecurrence, never loses its quality of mystery and isolation. The\r\nceaseless accompaniment to our lives which the heart is always beating,\r\nlike the inexorable stroke of an unseen pendulum, fills even the\r\nstoutest and bravest at times with a sense of awe. It seems now and then\r\nas though an independent living thing were in our breasts, and when it\r\nquickens and struggles, as it were, with its work, or languishes and\r\nhesitates in its efforts we have a sense of helpless domination by an\r\nexistence—a living thing—over whose vagaries we have no control.\r\n\r\nThe heart of man is no special endowment of the human race, nor even of\r\nthe higher animals. As I mentioned a few pages back, the oyster and\r\nother shell-fish have a heart which keeps time and beats the seconds for\r\ntheir uneventful lives, as does that of man for his more varied career.\r\nNot only the molluscs, but the insects, the spiders, the crabs,\r\nlobsters, and shrimps, and even the worms, have each a rhythmically\r\nbeating heart. In all of them the significance of this heart and its\r\nbeat are the same—it is driving the nourishing, oxygen-carrying blood\r\nthrough the great vessels (arteries), which branch from it like a tree\r\ninto the living tissues of the body, whence it returns by other vessels\r\n(the veins) back to the heart.\r\n\r\nIn man and the warm-blooded quadrupeds, in birds, reptiles, and fishes,\r\nthe blood is of a splendid red colour, and the transparent vessels can\r\nbe easily traced in their graceful ramifications and intricate networks,\r\nin consequence of the red blood showing through their walls. The red\r\ncolour is due to a peculiar body, which can be easily separated from the\r\nblood as crystals. It has the special duty of carrying oxygen gas\r\ndissolved and attached to it; and of giving up that essential element to\r\ncause slow burning or oxydation in all parts of the body whilst taking\r\nup fresh supplies of oxygen on its passage through the lungs or the\r\ngills. In many of the lower animals (for instance, the oyster) the blood\r\nis devoid of this red crystalline substance (which, by the bye, is\r\ncalled hæmoglobin), and accordingly we cannot easily catch sight either\r\nof the heart or the blood-vessels (see, however, Fig. 30). But in\r\nshell-fish the blood has a very pale blue tint, and this colour is due\r\nto a substance like hæmoglobin, which also can be crystallised, and is\r\nthe oxygen-carrier. Some sea-worms have a green substance of a similar\r\nnature dissolved in their blood, and one can trace their blood-vessels\r\nas a beautiful green network. A good many worms, for instance the common\r\nearth-worm and the leeches (a discovery made by Cuvier, and referred to\r\nby him on his deathbed), and many sea-worms have deep-red-coloured\r\nblood, due to the presence of the same crystalline substance which we\r\nfind in man’s blood. And even a snail, common in the ponds at Hampstead\r\nand such places—the flat coiled snail known as _Planorbis_—has blood\r\nof a fine crimson colour, due to the presence of the same red\r\noxygen-carrier, as an exception to the colourless or pale-blue blood\r\nfound in most shell-fish. Perhaps if oysters, too, had red blood,\r\nthere would be a prejudice against eating them in the uncooked\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe heart is essentially an enlargement of the great stem or main\r\nblood-vessel which, like the trunk of a tree, has branching roots at one\r\nend of it and ordinary branches at the other. The trunk branches, and\r\nroots of the “heart-tree” are, of course, hollow blood-holding tubes,\r\nnot solid fibrous structures, as are the woody branches and trunk of a\r\nvegetable tree. Further, the finest rootlets and the finest terminal\r\nbranches in the case of the heart-tree are connected to one another by\r\nthe network of very fine branches or by great blood-holding cavities,\r\nwhich occupy all parts of the body of an animal. The enlarged part of\r\nthe trunk of the tree-like system of blood-vessels—the heart—has\r\npowerful muscles forming its walls, the fibres disposed so as to\r\nsurround the contained chamber. When these muscular fibres contract,\r\nthey squeeze the walls of the chamber together and drive the blood out\r\nof it into the forward branches, called “arteries.” It is prevented from\r\ngoing backwards into the hinder branches called “veins” (which we\r\ncompare to the roots of a tree) by flaps which are so set on the inside\r\nof the great vessel at the entrance to those branches that the flaps are\r\nmade to move out across the space by the backward current, and thus\r\nprevent any backward flow, whilst a forward current merely presses them\r\nflat against the wall of the vessel, and thus no obstruction to a\r\nforward flow is presented. These flaps are called the valves of the\r\nheart. The consequence of this arrangement is that whilst blood flows\r\nfreely into the heart from the veins or hinder (root-like) set of\r\nvessels, it is driven by the muscular contraction of the heart—only in\r\none direction—namely, forwards into the arteries. This movement in\r\none direction is helped in some elongated hearts by the contraction of\r\nthe wall of the heart beginning behind and spreading quickly forward\r\nlike a wave. The heart of the common earth-worm and of small transparent\r\nworms with red blood like it, which are common in the mud of ponds and\r\nrivers and can be easily watched with the microscope so that one can see\r\nthrough their glass-like skin what is going on inside them, shows very\r\nbeautifully this wave of contraction. The heart in these worms is a long\r\ncontractile vessel which runs the whole length of the body along the\r\nback. You can watch the red blood flowing into it through the veins in\r\neach ring or segment of the worm’s body—slowly swelling it out—so that\r\nit looks like a long red cord. Then, suddenly, there is a movement like\r\na flash in its rapidity, passing from behind forwards! The walls of the\r\nred cord-like heart contract so as to drive the blood forward into the\r\narteries, which also are present in every ring of the worm’s body. At\r\nthe same time you can see the valves, which hang at the entrance of the\r\nveins to the heart, swing with a sudden “chuck” and close those vessels\r\nagainst the driven blood. The red cord becomes colourless progressively\r\nfrom behind forwards, owing to the squeezing out of the blood, and by\r\nthe time the movement has reached the head of the worm, the hinder part\r\nof the cord-like heart is beginning slowly to dilate again with the\r\ninflux of red blood from the veins.\r\n\r\nWhat causes the muscles of the heart to contract at regular intervals?\r\nThere is no doubt that the “stimulus” which excites the heart muscles to\r\ncontraction is in these simpler animals merely the tension or strain\r\nproduced by the presence of a sufficient quantity of blood which has\r\nflowed into the heart from the veins. The heart muscle, after its rapid\r\ncontraction, rests; it has no other rest, no sleep, as have all the\r\nother parts of the body. It must rest and take refreshment after each\r\neffort. Whilst it rests the blood quietly flows in and dilates the\r\nheart’s cavity; then the rested muscular wall of the heart, gently\r\nstretched by the recovery after compression of its elastic components,\r\nnourished and oxygenated by the blood, is ready for another “stroke,”\r\nand again it contracts tightly, emptying its cavity of blood, which is\r\ndriven into the arteries. So it goes on—effort and rest, effort and\r\nrest alternating without cease. Whilst it is the stroke of the heart\r\nwhich causes the blood to flow through the arteries into the finest\r\nnetwork of hair-like vessels, what is it that causes the blood to flow\r\non through the collecting veins, to reach the heart, and actually to\r\ndistend that collapsed cavity after its stroke? It must be remembered\r\nthat a very low pressure is enough to effect this. In the simplest\r\narrangements of worms and such-like animals, there is probably some\r\npressure transmitted to the blood in the veins by the heart-stroke; but\r\nthe elasticity of the heart-wall and its necessary tendency to resume\r\nits dilated condition after its squeezing by its rings of muscle, is\r\nwhat is chiefly effective in drawing on the blood in the veins into the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nIn man and the higher animals the whole mechanism of the heart is\r\ngreatly complicated by the action of the nervous system upon it and upon\r\nthe contraction or expansion of the blood vessels. In this way the rate\r\nof the beat of the heart is affected and brought into relation with the\r\nneeds of the blood circulation in remote parts of the body. The beat of\r\nthe heart in the human species is more rapid in children than in adults,\r\nand more rapid in women than in men, and it differs in all individuals\r\nunder differing conditions. Before birth it is 140 per minute, in the\r\nfirst month after birth 130, and gradually diminishes to 90 at nine\r\nyears of age, and at twenty-one to 70 in man and to 80 in woman. But\r\nthese figures only represent a general average; there are healthy men\r\nwhose pulse usually is less than 45 per minute, and there are\r\nindividuals who, without being invalids, yet have the movement of the\r\nheart so liable to increase in rapidity through mental or other\r\nexcitement, acting by nerves directly on the heart muscle, that the\r\npulse often goes up to 120. In the horse and the ox the pulse or heart\r\nbeat is 36 to 40 a minute; in the sheep 60 to 80; in the dog 100 to 120;\r\nin the rabbit 150; and in small creatures, like mice and moles, 200, and\r\neven more! I do not know what is the record for the elephant, but as it\r\nseems that the larger the mammal the slower the pulse, one would not\r\nexpect more than 20 to 25 beats a minute in his case.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to watch the beating of the heart of a flea or other small\r\ninsects—under the microscope—since the skin is sufficiently\r\ntransparent. It is not usually much more rapid than in man, but in the\r\nvery transparent little fresh-water shrimps which are called water-fleas\r\n(_Entomostraca_) I have seen the heart beating so rapidly that I could\r\nnot count its rate. The heart in insects and shrimps and their like is\r\nremarkable for the fact that whilst it pumps out blood through arteries\r\nboth in front and behind, it has no actual veins opening into it. All\r\nthe veins, which in their ancestors entered the heart in a row on each\r\nside of it, have united, and their walls broken down, so that the heart\r\nlies in a sac full of venous blood from which it draws its fill, when it\r\ndilates, through a series of valve-bearing openings on its surface,\r\nopenings which, in an earlier stage of development, were connected with\r\nindividual veins.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the _Ascidians_ or sea-squirts, common sac-like marine\r\ncreatures of most varied form, size, and colour, is perhaps the most\r\nextraordinary in the whole animal series. I have often watched it in\r\ntransparent individuals of this group. It is an oblong sac with\r\nbranching vessels at either end. It beats for some thirty or forty\r\nstrokes so as to drive the blood forwards; it then pauses, and the\r\nonlooker is astounded to see the wave of movement changed, and the heart\r\nsteadily beating the same number of strokes in the reversed direction.\r\nWhat were arteries become veins, and the veins become arteries. Then\r\nagain there is a pause—which seems like a moment of hesitation and\r\ndoubt—and the original direction of movement is resumed; then again\r\nthere is a pause and a reversal, and so on, with absolute regularity. It\r\nis still a matter for investigation as to why and how this altogether\r\nexceptional alternating reversal of the heart’s action is brought about.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact in illustration of the essential character of the\r\nheart and its beat that “hearts” are produced in some animals by\r\ndilatation of the lymph-vessels—a system of delicate vessels, difficult\r\nto see, which take up the colourless fluid which the blood-vessels exude\r\ninto the tissues and return it to the heart. The eel has a pair of these\r\n“lymph-hearts” in its tail, and the common frog has a pair near the\r\nshoulder-blades and another pair at the hips. These sacs have muscular\r\nwalls, and pulsate rhythmically like the blood-heart, driving on the\r\nlymph fluid through the lymph vessels to join the blood-stream.\r\n\r\nThe simplest thing in the animal world which can claim the name of a\r\nheart—or, at any rate, be compared with that organ—is found in those\r\nmicroscopic animalcules which consist of only a single “cell” or\r\ncorpuscle of living protoplasm. These animalcules may be compared to a\r\nsingle brick or unit of structure, whereas all other animals consist of\r\nthousands, or even millions, of such corpuscles or units aggregated and\r\nfitted together as are the bricks and planks of a house. In most of\r\nthese uni-cellular animalcules you may observe with a high-power\r\nmicroscope a little spherical liquid-holding cavity, which slowly\r\nenlarges, then bursts at the surface and collapses. After a brief\r\ninterval it forms again, and again bursts to the exterior. In the\r\n“bell-animalcule”—a beautiful active little creature only\r\none-thousandth of an inch in diameter—it may be seen to form, swell,\r\ncollapse, and re-form as often as twenty times in a minute (see Fig.\r\n41). Soluble colouring matter taken in by the animalcule with food is\r\nexcreted by the liquid accumulated in and ejected to the exterior by\r\nthis spherical chamber. It is called the “pulsating” or “contractile”\r\nvacuole, and by its rhythmical pulsating movement of dilatation and\r\ncollapse presents definite points of similarity to the alternately\r\ndilating and contracting hearts of higher animals. The entering flow of\r\nliquid here, as in the veins and heart of higher animals, is continuous.\r\nThe rhythm is due, as is the rhythm of the heart, to the alternation of\r\na brief period of activity or contraction, and a brief period of\r\nconsequent exhaustion, rest, and repair on the part of living\r\ncontractile substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nSLEEP\r\n\r\n\r\nAn enterprising journalist has recently published the replies of a\r\nnumber of well-known men to an inquiry as to how many hours’ sleep they\r\nare in the habit of taking, and what they find to be the best remedy for\r\nsleeplessness. Such an inquiry naturally leads on to further thoughts\r\nabout “Sleep.” What a mysterious, yet sweet and lovable thing it is! How\r\nstrange it is that we all regularly and gladly abandon ourselves to it!\r\nHow terrible is the state of those who cannot do so! And then one is led\r\nto ask, what is it? and why is it? Do all living things sleep for some\r\npart of the twenty-four hours? How does it differ from mere resting, and\r\nin what does its virtue consist?\r\n\r\nShakespeare has said the most beautiful words that have ever been\r\nuttered about sleep, and that because he knew what it was to seek for it\r\nin vain—\r\n\r\n  “Methought I heard a voice cry, ‘Sleep no more!\r\n  Macbeth does murder sleep,’ the innocent sleep;\r\n  Sleep, that knits up the ravell’d sleave of care,\r\n  The death of each day’s life, sore labour’s bath,\r\n  Balm of hurt minds, great Nature’s second course,\r\n  Chief nourisher in life’s feast.”\r\n\r\nAnd again, when the strenuous life of the great Bolingbroke has at last\r\novertaxed his brain, and he can no more find rest and unconsciousness\r\nat night, Shakespeare makes him say—\r\n\r\n  “How many thousand of my poorest subjects\r\n  Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,\r\n  Nature’s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,\r\n  That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down,\r\n  And steep my senses in forgetfulness?\r\n  Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,\r\n  Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,\r\n  And hush’d with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,\r\n  Than in the perfum’d chambers of the great,\r\n  Under the canopies of costly state,\r\n  And lull’d with sound of sweetest melody?”\r\n\r\nPoets have as a rule been too ready to make much of the likeness of\r\nsleep and death, whereas there is an absolute difference in their mere\r\nappearance. Sleep makes even those who are ill-favoured and coarse look\r\nbeautiful, imparts to its subjects a graciousness of expression and of\r\ncolour, and a gentle rhythmic movement, whilst suffusing them as it were\r\nwith an “aura” of contented trustfulness. These things are far from the\r\ncold stillness of pallid death. And this depends upon the fact that in\r\nsleep, though many of the activities of the body and mind are checked,\r\nand even arrested, there are yet still present the never-ceasing pulse\r\nof the heart, the flow of the blood, the intake and output of the\r\nbreath, and a certain subdued but still active tension of muscles, so\r\nthat though the body and limbs are relaxed they never assume the aspect\r\nof complete mechanical collapse which we see in death. The pupils of the\r\neyes are strongly contracted during sleep, not relaxed and expanded as\r\nare those of wide-awake people in the dark. There are some well-known\r\nworks of art—both painting and sculpture—in which the dead are not\r\ntruly represented, but are made to retain the resistfulness and pose of\r\nliving men and women; others show true observation in presenting the\r\nstartling and distinctive flaccidity of the newly dead, which is\r\nfollowed after a few hours by the equally characteristic rigor mortis,\r\nor stiffness of the dead. There are many fine studies of sleep by\r\nsculptors, but none which to my thinking so delicately and truthfully\r\npresent its most beautiful and peculiar effects on the muscular “tone”\r\nas a work in the Luxembourg Gallery in Paris, called “Le Nid”—a baby of\r\na year old and a little girl of three or four years, asleep side by side\r\non the cushion of a capacious arm-chair. The pose and the details of\r\nmuscular relaxation differ greatly and characteristically in the two\r\nchildren. One would like to see sleep at different ages and under\r\nvarious conditions of fatigue similarly portrayed, for there is a range\r\nand variety of expression in those who sleep, not perhaps as extensive,\r\nbut as beautiful as that to be found in those who are awake.\r\n\r\nAll things on the earth may be said (if we use the term in a wide sense)\r\nto sleep, for all are affected by the stimulation to activity caused by\r\nsunlight and by its cessation during night. It is only of late years\r\nthat we have come to know of fishes, crabs, worms, and star-fishes (many\r\nof them without eyes) which live in the depths of the ocean, where no\r\nlight penetrates and it is always night. The ultimate source of their\r\nfood is in the upper sunlit layers of water, to which they never\r\npenetrate, and from which particles of dead but nutritious matter (the\r\nbodies of those who have lived up there) rain down upon them\r\nincessantly, like manna on the Israelites. All things accessible to the\r\nsun’s rays are not equally, nor even similarly, affected by the\r\nalternation of day and night, and some not directly at all, but only by\r\nthe sleeping and waking of other things. The food of all living things\r\ncomes ultimately from plants which, in the presence of sunlight, and\r\nonly in that presence, and in virtue of its action upon their green\r\nleaves, manufacture starch and sugar from the carbonic acid which exists\r\nin the air and water around them, whilst they are also thus enabled to\r\ntake up nitrogen, and so to form their living substance or protoplasm.\r\nAt night those particles or cells of the living protoplasm of plants\r\nwhich are furnished with transparent green granules, so as to entangle\r\nthe sunlight, and by its aid feed on carbonic acid, cease this work.\r\nThey necessarily repose from their labour because the light has gone.\r\nThis is the simplest example of the sleep of living things. And that\r\nhere, too, as in higher creatures, sleep is not a merely negative\r\nthing—a mere cessation—is shown by the fact that it is at night that\r\nother changes go on in the plant. The manufactured food takes effect on\r\nthe cells or particles nourished by it; in the night the well-fed,\r\nenlarged “cells” in the growing parts of many plants slowly divide each\r\none into two, and each of these again into two, and so on, so as to\r\nincrease their total number and produce growth and development of the\r\nplant. This alternation of activities in day and night occurs even in\r\nthe invisible microscopic vegetation of pools and streams. Animals—even\r\nthe most minute, only visible with a strong microscope—move about in\r\nsearch of “bits” of food—in fact, bits of other animals or of\r\nplants—and they, too, are, with special exceptions, checked in their\r\nsearch for food by the darkness, for even extremely minute and simple\r\nanimals are guided in their search by light—that is to say, by a more\r\nor less efficient sense of sight. Thus we see that in a general way the\r\nsun is truly the ruler of life, and that when he is hidden from us we\r\nall become quiescent, a condition which may be rightly considered as\r\nthe elementary form—the simplest equivalent of the sleep of man. The\r\nquiescence which falls on the earth with the setting of the sun has,\r\nhowever, become the opportunity of two different classes of living\r\nthings to seize an advantage. Beasts of prey, many of them, sleep during\r\nthe day, and steal forth at night on velvet foot to pounce on the\r\nslumbering animals which are their necessary food. Another group of\r\ntimid animals, moths and small beasts like mice, hedgehogs, and lemurs,\r\nfind their safety in the dark, and only then venture forth. Even so, the\r\nmoths are met by special nocturnal enemies, the bats. So that the\r\nprimitive arrangement is complicated by a wakefulness, exchanging day\r\nfor night.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to apply the word “sleep” to the state of profound repose\r\nwhich other living things appear to enter upon at night, so far as we\r\ncan judge by changes of activity and attitude—although it must be\r\nremembered that the sleep of man is what we really indicate by that\r\nword, and that it is difficult to trace anything beyond a superficial\r\nsimilarity between man’s sleep and the repose or quiescence following\r\nupon activity in other living things—excepting those which by their\r\nstructure and the working of their mechanism are obviously comparable to\r\nman, such as beasts, birds, reptiles, and fishes. The “sleep of plants”\r\nis the term applied to the closing of the flower, the drooping of the\r\nflower-head and of the leaves of many of the common flowering plants,\r\nwhich occurs at sunset or during the later hours of sunlight. But it\r\nseems that this is not really comparable to man’s sleep. The closing of\r\nthe flower appears to be a protection of its perfume from useless\r\nevaporation during the darkness, and the drooping a device to avoid the\r\nsettlement of dew and the injurious action of cold. Living things always\r\nfurnish us with examples of adaptations resisting the general law—and\r\nas there are moths which fly by night, so also there are flowers which\r\nremain closed by day and open at night to attract these moths, by whom\r\ntheir pollen is carried and their fertilisation effected. The\r\ntobacco-plants of our gardens are examples of these night-opening\r\nflowers, which attract the nocturnal moths by their heavy perfume, and\r\nthere are many others.\r\n\r\nThe movements of plants are much more definite and varied than one is\r\napt to suppose. Leaves and flowers turn to or away from the sun, or to\r\nor from the position which will favour a deposit of moisture; or, again,\r\ntheir tendrils will explore and seize upon supports, enabling them to\r\nsecure a hold, and so to climb. The sensitive plant exhibits rapid\r\ndrooping movements of its leaflets and leaf-stalks when touched or\r\nsubjected to vibration.\r\n\r\nAn allied plant which shows slower but definite movement of its leaflets\r\nhas been supposed to furnish thereby prophetic indications of the\r\nweather, and even to foretell earthquakes. This plant is the _Abrus\r\nprecatorius_, the seeds of which are called crab’s-eyes, and are used in\r\nIndia by jewellers and druggists as weights—averaging a little less\r\nthan two grains. They are harmless when eaten, but contain a poison\r\ncalled abrine, which causes them rapidly to produce fatal results when\r\nintroduced beneath the skin. Under the name “jequerity” they were\r\nintroduced into this country in 1882 for the treatment of ophthalmia.\r\nThis is the plant which was celebrated, about twenty years ago, as the\r\nearthquake plant or weather plant, owing to the statements of an\r\nAustrian naturalist as to its marvellous powers of prophecy by the\r\nmovement of its leaflets—statements which were carefully examined by\r\nbotanists at Kew Gardens at the time and shown to be devoid of\r\njustification. Earth tremors, like other vibrations, cause the leaflets\r\nto move and change their pose as they may cause animals to utter cries\r\nof alarm, but the movements of the leaflets have no more prophetic\r\ncharacter than have those of the delicate pendulums, called\r\nseismographs, by which it is now usual to register the constantly\r\noccurring slight vibrations of the earth’s crust.\r\n\r\nThat beasts and birds enjoy a nocturnal sleep similar to that of man,\r\nwhich is occasionally—like his sleep—transferred from night to\r\ndaytime, is a matter of common knowledge. These animals, like man, lower\r\nthe eyelids and adopt a position of ease when sleeping, even though they\r\noften remain poised on their legs. The question has been raised as to\r\nwhether fishes sleep, since they have no eyelids and remain when at rest\r\npoised in the water. We made some inquiries on this subject in the\r\nlaboratory of the Marine Biological Association at Plymouth some years\r\nago, and came to the conclusion, from the observation of various marine\r\nfishes in the aquarium there, that fishes do sleep at night. They come\r\nto rest on the bottom of the tanks, and are not so quickly responsive to\r\na touch or intrusion of any kind as they are in the daytime. It is\r\nprobable that this condition of repose is more definitely marked in some\r\nkinds of fishes than in others, but in all shallow-water marine\r\norganisms the absence of light produces a corresponding period of\r\nquiescence. That there is a good deal more than this involved in the\r\nsleep of the higher animals and of man will be apparent when we come to\r\nstudy it more closely.\r\n\r\nThe sleep of man, and of animals which have, like man, a large and\r\nwell-developed nervous system—has for its salient feature the cessation\r\nor extreme lowering of the “psychical” activity of the brain. When sleep\r\nis at its height external agents (such as a touch, a sound, a flash of\r\nlight) which in the waking state set up through the nerves of the\r\norgans of the senses complex changes in the brain, no longer do so. They\r\nnot only fail to excite consciousness and to leave their mark on the\r\nmemory, but they do not produce even a simple unconscious response. Yet\r\nif they are of a sufficient degree of violence (varying according to the\r\ndepth of the sleep), they do reach the brain, and thus “awake” the\r\nsleeper. Corresponding to the absence of receptive activity of the brain\r\nin sleep is the absence of outgoing impulses from that organ; there is\r\nno such control of the muscles as in the waking state, the head nods,\r\nthe eyelids droop, and the muscular action by which the erect posture is\r\nmaintained is in abeyance, although in a greatly lessened degree some\r\namount of muscular tone is unconsciously retained.\r\n\r\nThe passage from the waking state to that of deep sleep is not sudden\r\nbut graduated, and so is the process of awakening. In the intermediate\r\ncondition, either before or after deep sleep (often only a minute or two\r\nin duration) the brain can still receive, more or less confusedly,\r\nimpressions from the exterior through the organs of sense, and it is in\r\nthis way that “dreams” are set going, and may be afterwards either\r\nforgotten or remembered. In full sleep the mind is a blank. As a rule\r\nhealthy sleep becomes gradually more complete in the first hour, and\r\nthen very slowly less profound. But there are not any sufficient\r\nobservations on the “quality” of sleep after short or long duration. In\r\nsleep it is not only the brain which is at rest: the whole body shares\r\nin the condition. The pulse and breathing are slower, the digestive\r\norgans and the bladder are more or less at rest. Both the intake of\r\noxygen into the lungs and the expiration of carbonic acid are lessened.\r\nThe chemical changes within the body are lessened though still\r\nproceeding, and as a consequence the temperature is lowered.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how incomplete at present is the physiologist’s knowledge\r\nof both the actual condition of the brain in sleep and of the immediate\r\ncauses which produce that condition. It is probably true (though it is\r\ndisputed) that the brain becomes pale during sleep, owing to a\r\ncontraction of the blood vessels, and that the inactivity of the brain\r\narises from this condition. But it is not obvious what determines the\r\ncontraction of these vessels at the definitely recurring period of\r\nsleep. It is probable that the nervous tissue of the brain is, as are\r\nthe muscles of the body, poisoned or choked (as it were) by the chemical\r\nproducts of the day’s activity, and so readily cease to be active until\r\nthe injurious products have had time to be carried away by the blood\r\nstream. Muscular substance undoubtedly is affected in this way, and that\r\ngreat muscle the heart, though never resting for a lengthened period,\r\nrests after each pulse or contraction, and recovers itself in the brief\r\ninterval.\r\n\r\nIt is also probable that the exhaustion by the day’s activity of the\r\noxygen stored up in the various tissues of the body produces a condition\r\nof quiescence whilst the store is replenished. Stimulation of the nerves\r\nthrough the sense-organs of sight, hearing, and touch will prevent or\r\nretard this natural quiescence, and the cessation of that stimulation is\r\nfavoured first of all by the darkness of night and by the closing of the\r\neyelid, as well as by the removal of clothes which more or less irritate\r\nthe skin; also by the would-be sleeper taking up a position of perfect\r\nrest, and by the exercise of his will, withdrawing his brain as much as\r\npossible from all external influences. The would-be sleeper also\r\ncontrols, when possible, that internal stimulation of the brain which we\r\ncall attention. It is the failure (owing to unhealthy conditions) to\r\ncontrol the latter which leads to the most serious kind of\r\nsleeplessness, when the brain gets for hours out of restraint and works\r\nincessantly like an independent existence. The disturbance of the\r\nnervous system set up by irritation of the digestive organs, whether\r\naccompanied by pain or not, is an independent cause of sleeplessness\r\nwhich often co-operates with the first, and is (through the mechanism of\r\nthe nerves) often set going (though it may arise independently) by an\r\nunhealthy excess in the excitement of the brain’s activity. There is no\r\npanacea for sleeplessness; the only thing to do is to consult a\r\nfirst-rate physician, and strictly follow his advice.\r\n\r\nThere are many irregularities and abnormal manifestations of sleep.\r\nThere is the sleep which is induced by drugs such as opium, chloral, and\r\nalcohol, and that induced by chloroform, ether, and nitric gas. There is\r\nthe heavy sleep accompanied by stertorous breathing, and there is the\r\nunconscious condition called “coma.” Then there is the prolonged\r\nsleeping called “trance,” of which that of the Sleeping Beauty, only to\r\nbe broken by a kiss, is an example. It is not possible, in the present\r\nstate of knowledge, to give an adequate account and explanation of the\r\ncondition of the brain in these different forms of sleep, nor of the\r\ncauses which induce that condition. One of the most interesting forms of\r\nsleep is the condition called “somnambulism,” or sleep-walking, in which\r\npart only of the brain is asleep, and other parts connected with various\r\ndegrees of mental activity are in waking order. Sleep-walking is a\r\ncondition which occurs spontaneously. On the other hand, “hypnotism” is\r\nthe name for a peculiar kind of sleep produced intentionally by an\r\noperator on a patient by certain treatment and direction. In one of the\r\nstages of artificially induced hypnotic or “mesmeric” sleep—called the\r\nsomnambulic stage—only so much of the brain is asleep as is concerned\r\nwith conscious memory. The brain receives stimulation through the\r\nsense-organs, and the patient has the eyes open and appears to be\r\nawake. In this state he is peculiarly open to suggestion by words, which\r\ncan be made to set up the most extraordinary illusions and consequent\r\nbehaviour. On “waking” the patient has no memory of what has occurred,\r\nthough a suggestion received in the somnambulic stage may persist in the\r\nunconscious memory, and cause conduct on the part of the patient (many\r\nhours after the brief hypnotic sleep has passed) which is entirely\r\ninexplicable by the patient himself or by those who are not aware of the\r\nfact that he had received a “suggestion” or “direction” when in the\r\nhypnotised state. The senses of smell, hearing, and touch are often\r\nabnormally acute in a hypnotised patient, but there is no evidence to\r\nshow that the brain of such a person can be influenced or “communicated\r\nwith” excepting through the ordinary channels of the sense-organs.\r\n“Day-dreaming” and “reverie” are conditions resembling the hypnotic\r\nsleep. The brain of each of us is constantly doing much of its work in a\r\nstate of partial hypnotism, and the term “unconscious cerebration” has\r\nbeen used to describe it. A most interesting and difficult chapter of\r\nthe study of mental disease belongs here.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged sleep of some animals in the winter, called “hibernation,”\r\nseems to be closely similar to ordinary sleep, but is set up by the\r\ndepressing action of continuous cold instead of by the daily recurring\r\nquiescence of night and by the exhaustion due to the day’s activity.\r\nMany animals—such as the marmot and dormouse, the frog and the\r\nsnail—exhibit this winter sleep. It has been found by experiment that\r\neven in midsummer the dormouse can be made to “hibernate,” by exposing\r\nit artificially to a low temperature, and hibernating animals can be\r\nroused from their long sleep by bringing them into warmth. During the\r\nwinter sleep hibernating animals take no food, the pulse is slowed\r\ndown, and the body temperature falls. The scattered fat of the body, and\r\nfatty matter and other material stored in special structures called\r\n“hibernating glands,” are oxidised and slowly consumed during this\r\nperiod, which may last for three or even four months. The animal on\r\nwaking is often in a very emaciated condition.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly the case that the human natives of high latitudes\r\n(such as the Norwegians), where there is no night in full summer, and\r\nwhere there is prolonged darkness in winter, have acquired the habit of\r\nkeeping awake for many days in succession in summer, whilst making up\r\nfor the loss of sleep by excessive indulgence in it during the winter.\r\nIt is by no means clear how far man is capable of resisting the demand\r\nfor recurrent daily sleep without injury to health. Undoubtedly many men\r\nare compelled by their avocations to sleep by day and wake by night. The\r\nlength and duration of “spells of sleep” and the power to sleep little\r\nor not at all at one season, and almost uninterruptedly at another,\r\nwithout injury to health, are matters of habit, occupation, and\r\ncircumstance. We have no ground for saying that every man “ought” to\r\nsleep eight hours or more per diem, or, on the contrary, for insisting\r\nthat he should only sleep five or less. All depends on what he is doing\r\nwhen he is awake, and what other people are doing (so as to disturb him)\r\nwhen he is asleep; and we do not even know whether ten or twelve hours’\r\nsleep would injure a man, were he able to take it, nor can we suggest\r\nhow it would injure him supposing it did not interfere with his feeding\r\nand exercise.\r\n\r\nAs to quantities of sleep, there is the curious fact that the amount\r\nhabitually taken in the civilised communities of this part of the world\r\ndiffers at different ages. Babies sleep a good part of the twenty-four\r\nhours, and probably schoolboys and schoolgirls (under our present\r\nconditions of life and work) ought to be given ten hours or more. Whilst\r\nadult men sleep from six to eight or nine hours, it is a curious fact\r\nthat old people—not very old people, but those of sixty-five or\r\nthereabouts—often find themselves unable to sleep more than four hours\r\nat night, and take an hour or two in the daytime to make up for the\r\ndeficiency. I remember hearing Mr. Darwin state this as to himself to\r\nhis physician, Sir Andrew Clarke, who said it was very usual at his age,\r\nand difficult to explain, since at a greater age, when a man is called\r\n“very old,” a more or less continuous somnolent condition sets in. The\r\nfather of a great judicial dignitary of these days, himself a barrister\r\nin large practice, when he was sixty years old would snatch fifteen or\r\ntwenty minutes’ sleep at any and every opportunity throughout the day,\r\neven at the midday meal sometimes, so as altogether to disconcert those\r\nwho were with him, and he told me that he never slept more than four\r\nhours at night, but got up and commenced work at four in the morning.\r\nThe cessation in early old age of the desire for more than half the\r\namount of sleep taken by younger men suggests that the regulating cause\r\nof the number of hours which are needed for sleep may be simply and\r\ndirectly the actual amount of work done by body and mind. This\r\nimperceptibly becomes less as men grow older, and so less recuperative\r\nsleep is necessary, though what work they do may be more effective and\r\nbetter adjusted to its purpose when they have arrived at the condition\r\nwhich is called “old age.”\r\n\r\nWe have seen that sleep in its widest sense comprises the simple\r\ncondition of quiescence brought about in even the minutest living things\r\nby the recurring night, as well as the strangely elaborated varieties of\r\ncessation of activity in the whole or parts of the brain of man and of\r\nhis body. Some of these cessations of activity naturally and\r\nspontaneously occur in unsophisticated mankind, when darkness falls on\r\nthe earth at each succeeding evening. And it is hardly possible to doubt\r\nthat a tendency to periodic sleep has become fixed in the substance of\r\nliving things by the alternation of night and day—as well as in some\r\ncases by the change of the seasons.\r\n\r\nI must conclude these notes about sleep by relating a very curious case\r\nof sleep, resembling the winter-sleep of higher animals, on the part of\r\na snail. This was the case of a desert snail from Egypt, which was\r\nwithdrawn into its shell, the mouth of the shell being closed with a\r\nglistening film secreted by the snail, as is usual with snails in this\r\ncountry in winter when they sleep. The desert snail in question was\r\naffixed to a tablet of wood in a glass case in the natural history\r\ndepartment of the British Museum on March 25, 1846. On March 7, 1850,\r\nthat is four years afterwards, it was noticed by a visitor looking at\r\nthe case that the snail had emerged from his shell and discoloured the\r\npaper around, but had again retired. So the officials unlocked the case\r\nand removed the snail from the tablet and placed him in tepid water. He\r\nrapidly and completely recovered, crawled about as a wide-awake snail\r\nshould, and sat for his portrait. This may be regarded as an instance of\r\nunusually long sleep, natural to this species of snail, and related\r\nprobably to the frequently prolonged dryness of the snail’s\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nWe are led by such a case as this on to what are called examples of\r\n“suspended animation.” Wheel-animalcules, and some other minute\r\ncreatures which are found living in tiny pools of water, on the bark of\r\ntrees, and in the hollows of leaves, naturally dry up when the water\r\nevaporates. You may dry them yourself in a watchglass; they appear as\r\nnothing more than shapeless dust particles mixed with the dried mud of\r\na drop of dirty water. They may be kept in this state for months—even\r\nyears. I do not know that any limit has been ascertained. But when you\r\nadd pure rain-water to the dust in the watchglass, it softens, and in\r\nless than an hour the little wheel-animalcules have softened too, and\r\nexpanded into life, swimming about whilst the delicate spikes on their\r\n“wheels” vibrate regularly as though they had never ceased to do so, and\r\nas though the animalcules had not for years been dried-up little\r\nmummies.\r\n\r\nOf course, the term “suspended animation” has been applied in earlier\r\ntimes to the often exaggerated stories of “trance” and deathlike sleep\r\nin human beings. But it is now with more justice applied to these\r\ninstances of dried animalcules which return to life when wetted, and to\r\nsimilar cases of prolonged retention of vitality by seeds, since it\r\nwould appear that in these dried animalcules life really is actually and\r\ntotally suspended, although the mechanism is there which resumes its\r\nlife when the necessary moisture is supplied. In cases of trance in man\r\nand hibernation in animals, the heart is still very slowly and feebly\r\nbeating, and the breathing is still—almost imperceptibly—at work. The\r\nchemical changes are still very slowly and gently proceeding. The buried\r\nIndian wizard, and the snail, and the Sleeping Beauty are moist, and\r\nchemically active, though feebly so; life is not absolutely suspended.\r\nBut in the dried animalcule (though complete chemical desiccation is not\r\neffected), the removal of the water from the body actually arrests the\r\nchanges which we call life, just as a needle may arrest the\r\nbalance-wheel of a watch. Supply the water, or remove the needle, and\r\nlife ceases to be suspended; it goes on once more (as one of the rules\r\nof Bridge ambiguously enacts) “as though no mistake had been made.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE UNIVERSAL STRUCTURE OF LIVING THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout doubt, the greatest and most important statement which can be\r\nmade about living things is that they are either separate minute\r\nparticles of living matter or (more commonly) are built up by thousands\r\nof such minute particles which have in each individual animal and plant\r\noriginated from a single such particle (the fertilised germ), by its\r\ndivision into two, and the subsequent division of these two each into\r\ntwo, and of the four so produced each into two—and so on, until by\r\nrepeated division into two, millions of corpuscles, hanging together as\r\none mass, are the result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.—Simple “cells,” consisting of naked protoplasm,\r\nchanging shape and taking in solid food particles. A, is a series of\r\nfour successive changes of shape of a fresh-water animalcule, the\r\nproteus or amœba; B, is a similar series of three views of a separate\r\ncreeping kind of corpuscle found in the blood and lymph-spaces of\r\nanimals, and called a “phagocyte.” It is also said to be “amœboid,”\r\nfrom its resemblance to the amœba or proteus-animalcule. B, is from\r\nthe blood of the guinea-pig. It is not a parasite, but one of the\r\nvarious kinds of cells which build up the animal body, and are derived\r\nfrom the single original egg-cell (see Fig. 31) by continued division.\r\nThe three drawings show three changes of shape occurring in the same\r\n“phagocyte” in a few minutes. It is engulphing a fever-producing\r\nblood-parasite, a spirillum, marked _a_, into its soft, slimy\r\nprotoplasm, to be there digested and destroyed. In the same way the\r\namœba, A, is seen in four stages of engulphing the vegetable\r\nparticle, _a_. In the fourth figure the letter _b_ points to water taken\r\ninto the amœba’s protoplasm with the food-particle _a_. In all the\r\nfigures, _c_ points to the “vacuole” or liquid-holding cavity, which\r\nbursts and re-forms in A; the letter _d_ points to the cell-nucleus.]\r\n\r\nThe particles of living matter are spoken of as “cells” for a very\r\ncurious reason, to which I will revert. The living matter is called\r\n“protoplasm” (primitive or fundamental slime). A “cell” in the language\r\nof microscopists means a corpuscle or more or less rounded or\r\nirregularly shaped particle of protoplasm. Cells commonly vary in size\r\nfrom 1/5000th to 1/200th of an inch in breadth, and may be much larger.\r\nProtoplasm—the living substance of “cells”—is a slimy body, almost\r\nliquid, but yet tenacious. It is transparent, but clouded by fine\r\ngranules, and can often be seen with a very high power of the microscope\r\nto consist of more and of less liquid matter, intermixed like an\r\nemulsion. It often has within it large cavities filled with liquid, and\r\nalso often oil drops; in other cases hard concretions or coarse\r\ngranules. But apart from other things, the protoplasm of a “cell”\r\nalways contains within it a special, firmer, and denser part, enclosed\r\nin an enveloping coat or skin. This dense body is the “nucleus,” or\r\nkernel, and is of the very greatest importance in the chemical changes\r\nand movements which constitute the life of the cell. It is usually\r\nspherical, and in the living state often looks clear and bright. All\r\ncells, whether they are found building up the bodies of plants and\r\nanimals like so many living bricks, or living freely and singly as\r\nanimalcules, have the essential structure just described—a semi-liquid\r\nyet tenacious material enclosing a globular firmer body, the nucleus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.—A, cells forming soft vegetable tissue; _a_,\r\ncell-wall; _b_, protoplasm; _c_, liquid-holding cavity in the\r\nprotoplasm; _d_, the nucleus.

F, the same contracted: observe the\r\nnucleus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.—Copy of part of Robert Hook’s drawing of a\r\nmagnified piece of cork, showing the “cells” so named by him in 1665.]\r\n\r\nHow did these viscous nucleated corpuscles come to be called “cells”? It\r\nwas in this wise. At the end of the seventeenth century Dr. Robert Hook,\r\nsecretary of the Royal Society, published a beautiful book of folio\r\nsize, entitled _Micrographia_. In this he pictured various minute\r\ninsects and various natural products as seen under his microscope. Among\r\nthe objects figured and described was a piece of cork (Fig. 38). Hook\r\nshowed that it was built up of a number of empty, air-holding, box-like\r\nchambers, less than the hundredth of an inch in length, and these he\r\ncalled “cells,” comparing them to the “cells” of the bee’s honeycomb.\r\nLater observers found that this “cellular” structure was very common in\r\nplants—but it was not until more than a hundred years later that it was\r\nobserved that the “cells” which build up the soft stems and leaves of\r\nplants are not empty or merely air-holding, but contain a liquid or\r\nviscid matter. Robert Browne, a great botanist, who lived within the\r\nmemory of some of our older naturalists, first observed and described\r\nthe “nucleus,” or kernel, within the cells of some lily-like plants, and\r\ngave it that name (Fig. 37 A, _d_). About the thirties of last century,\r\nby aid of improved microscopes, a structure like that of the vegetable\r\n“cell” and its “nucleus” was discovered in some animal materials, or\r\n“tissues,” as they are termed—for instance, in cartilage (Fig. 39). The\r\nword “tissue” is applied to each of the various layers and masses, such\r\nas epiderm, fibrous tissue, muscle, nerve, cartilage, bone, which can be\r\ndistinguished in an animal body and separated from one another, just as\r\nwe may separate the “tissues” of a man’s clothes—the leathern, woollen,\r\nsilken, cotton, linen: the cords, laces, threads, and pads or stuffing.\r\nThe full meaning of this existence of “cells” or “cellular” structure in\r\nthe tissue of plants and animals only gradually became evident. A very\r\nremarkable discoverer, Professor Schwann, of Liège (with whom when he\r\nwas an old man I spent an afternoon a great many years ago), was the\r\nfirst to grasp the great facts and to put forward what has been ever\r\nsince called “the cell theory” of animal and vegetable structure and\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.—A piece of cartilage, showing the cells which\r\nhave formed it embedded in the (shaded) firm substance, and connected to\r\none another by branching processes of protoplasm.]\r\n\r\nSchwann, in 1836, showed that the important thing about a “cell” is not\r\nthe box or cell-wall so much as the viscid contents and the nucleus. But\r\nthe name “cell” was (strangely enough) retained for the contents, even\r\nwhen the box-like chamber was absent—much as we speak of “a bottle of\r\nwine,” meaning the contents of the bottle, and not the glass vessel\r\nholding it. It was shown that the box-like case or cell-wall (the\r\noriginal “cell” of Hook) is actually formed by the living nucleated\r\nplasm or viscid matter within it, just as a snail forms its shell, by\r\nthe separation or “secretion” of a dead, firm, chemical deposit on its\r\nliving surface. Schwann showed that all—not merely special exceptional\r\ninstances, but all—the tissues of plants and of animals are built up by\r\nnucleated cells, the cell-wall being often not hard and box-like, but\r\nsoft, gelatinous, irregular in shape, and sometimes very thin, sometimes\r\nvery thick. Every living cell is thus surrounded by the chemical\r\nproducts of its own activity, or may deposit those products within\r\nitself as in the goblet-cell and the fat-cell seen in Fig. 40, C and D,\r\nand these products differ in different tissues. The cells of a tissue,\r\nusing the word to mean the soft nucleated particles or corpuscles of\r\nprotoplasm or “cell-substance,” must be regarded as the microscopic\r\nliving “weavers” or makers of the tissue. The cells in one tissue may\r\nform a honeycomb of boxes; in another a jelly-like mass or a fibrous\r\nnetwork, with the cell-substance scattered as nucleated particles in it\r\n(Fig. 39). Or the cells may be elongated and contractile (Fig. 37, E,\r\nF). They may be more or less fused with one another, as in flesh or\r\nmuscular fibre; but we can always recognise the presence of the\r\nindividual cells under the microscope by their distinct and separate\r\n“nuclei.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.—Three kinds of cells, magnified a thousand\r\ntimes linear. A, a row of cilia-bearing cells. B, a single detached\r\nciliated cell: observe the nucleus in each cell. C, a goblet-cell, from\r\na mucous surface, producing _c_, a slimy secretion; _d_, the wall of the\r\ncell; _b_, the nucleus; _a_, the protoplasm in which the secretion _c_\r\nwas accumulated until it burst out at the free end of the cell. D, a\r\nfat-cell; _a_, the nucleus surrounded by protoplasm; _e_, the thin layer\r\nof protoplasm enveloping the great oil drop _f_, which has formed within\r\nit.]\r\n\r\nSchwann’s most important conclusion from this universal presence of soft\r\ncorpuscles of cell-substance, each with its globular nucleus, in all the\r\ntissues and most varied parts of animals as well as plants, was that the\r\nlife of a living thing, the chemical and physical changes which go on in\r\nit from birth to death, consist in chemical and physical changes in each\r\nof these microscopic, nucleated bodies, and that the life of the whole\r\nanimal or plant is the sum of the lives of these microscopic units. If\r\nwe wish to know more about the real nature of the growth and activities\r\nof living things, said Schwann, we must thoroughly study and ascertain\r\nthe chemical and physical changes, and the properties of the\r\ncell-substance in all the different varieties of tissue. That is the\r\ncelebrated “cell-theory” of Schwann. And this examination of, and\r\nexperiment with, the cells of all kinds of tissues of plants and animals\r\nhas been going on ever since Schwann made his historic statement more\r\nthan seventy years ago. The branch of science called “histology” is the\r\noutcome of that study.\r\n\r\nMicroscopes have been immensely improved since Schwann wrote, first in\r\nEngland by the father of the present Lord Lister, then later in Germany\r\nby Abbé and Zeiss, of Jena. A variety of methods have been devised for\r\nmaking the “cells” in thick, solid tissues visible. Very thin\r\nsections—thin enough to be transparent—were at first cut from the\r\nfresh tissues, and examined by transmitted light. This did very well in\r\na rough way, but better results were obtained by hardening the tissues\r\nin alcohol or chromic acid, when wonderfully fine sections could be cut\r\nand rendered translucent by soaking in varnish, in which they were\r\npreserved for study with the microscope, between two plates of glass.\r\nThe sections were stained with various dyes, such as carmine, log-wood,\r\nthe aniline dyes, etc., and it was found that the nuclei of the cells\r\nand the granules and fibres both in the minute cells and in the\r\nsurrounding substance manufactured by them, could be distinguished more\r\nclearly by means of their differing affinity for the dyes. And whilst\r\nendless section-cutting and staining and careful drawing and record of\r\nthe structure discovered, was proceeding in hundreds of\r\nlaboratories—other observers especially devoted themselves to the\r\ndifficult task of seeing the cell-substance or protoplasm and its\r\nnucleus under the highest power of the microscope, whilst still alive!\r\nIt would seem a hopeless task to examine with a high-power microscope\r\nthe cells (less than a thousandth of an inch broad) inside the solid\r\nstem or leaves of a plant or of an animal’s body without killing the\r\nplant or animal and the cells of which they consist. As most of my\r\nreaders know, the front lens (or “glass”) of a high-power microscope has\r\nto be brought very close indeed to any object in order to bring it into\r\nfocus—as near as the one twenty-fifth of an inch. Then the object\r\nexamined must be very small and transparent, in order that the light may\r\npass through it, as through the slide-picture in a magic lantern, and so\r\nform a clear, well-defined picture in the focus of the microscope, where\r\nthe eye receives it.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are some facts about living cells or corpuscles of\r\nprotoplasm which enable us to examine living cells, in spite of these\r\ndifficulties. In the first place, there are a whole host of minute\r\nanimals and plants—of many different kinds—which consist of only one\r\ncell or nucleated corpuscle of protoplasm (Fig. 36 A); they are\r\ntransparent, abound in fresh water and sea water, and can be searched\r\nfor with the microscope in a drop of water placed on a flat glass plate\r\nand covered with a specially thin glass slip. Many of these have been\r\nstudied for hours—and even days—continuously, and the remarkable\r\ninternal currents and movements of their viscid “protoplasm,” its\r\nchanges of shape, its feeding and growth, and the details of the process\r\nof division into two—by which it multiplies—have been ascertained, as\r\nwell as the action upon it of light, heat, electricity, and mechanical\r\nshock, and of all sorts of chemical substances, carefully introduced\r\nbeneath the cover-glass. A second fact of great importance is that the\r\n“cells” or protoplasmic corpuscles, which build up a complex plant or\r\nanimal, do not die at once when the plant or animal “dies,” that is to\r\nsay, the animal or plant may be “killed” and fine bits of transparent\r\ntissue removed from it and placed beneath the microscope, where, with\r\nproper care, the cells may be kept alive for some time. The hairs of\r\nmany plants are strings of transparent “cells,” or boxes, containing\r\nliving, streaming, active protoplasm. These hairs can be cut off, and\r\nthe cells will remain alive for a long time whilst they are under the\r\nmicroscope (see Fig. 15 _bis_). The transparent wall of the eye—called\r\nthe cornea—can be removed from a frog after it has been killed, and the\r\nstill-living cells in the delicate glass-like tissue can be studied with\r\nthe highest powers of the microscope, and give evidence of their life by\r\ntheir movements and other changes. Most convenient and important for\r\nthis study is the blood—for there the cells are loose, floating in the\r\nliquid. The cells in a minute drop of human blood can be kept alive for\r\nhours, if the glass slide is kept warm, as it easily can be, and I have\r\nseen the cells in a drop of frog’s blood (skilfully treated) still\r\nalive, and exhibiting active movements, a fortnight after the frog, from\r\nwhich the drop of blood came, was dead and buried. These floating,\r\nmoving cells of the blood are the “phagocytes,” which engulf and digest\r\ndisease germs and other particles (Fig. 36 B). Other more numerous cells\r\nof the blood are the oxygen-carriers, or red corpuscles, which do not\r\nshow any movements or changes of an active kind whilst alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nPROTOPLASM, LIFE AND DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of the study of living cell-substance, or protoplasm, is to\r\nshow that every cell has an individual life, and often makes this\r\nmanifest by its movement, change of shape, and internal currents of\r\ngranules, as well as by the special chemical substances it produces and\r\nconsumes. All depend for their activity upon the presence of free\r\noxygen; all are killed by heat far less than that of boiling water; they\r\ncontinually imbibe water charged with the chemical substances which\r\nnourish them and cause them to grow in bulk and to divide into two; and\r\nthey manufacture various chemical bodies in the protoplasm and emit\r\nheat, electrical discharges, and sometimes light. Some or other of them,\r\nin fact, do in their small microscopic way all that the complex, big\r\nanimal or plant, of which they are constituents, is seen to do. The\r\ncells of the liver manufacture the bile, those of the salivary glands\r\nthe saliva, and those of the intestinal wall a mucous fluid, and squeeze\r\nout or eject those products into the adjacent ducts (see Fig. 40 C).\r\nOther cells lay down (as cell-wall or coating) fibrous and hard\r\nsubstances which form the skeleton; others become converted into horn\r\nand are shed from the surface of the skin in man as “scurf”; others form\r\nthe great contractile masses called muscles. One lot are told off to\r\ncontrol the other cells by something resembling a system of electrical\r\nwires and batteries—these are the nerve-cells (Fig. 37 D), with their\r\nfine, thread-like branches, the nerve-fibres, which are long enough to\r\npermeate every part of the body and place it in connection with the\r\nnerve-cells in the great centres called brain, spinal cord, and ganglia.\r\n\r\nAt one time it was thought that the cells in the tissues of plants and\r\nanimals could originate _de novo_ by a sort of precipitation of liquid\r\nmatter. But it is now known that every cell has originated by the\r\ndivision of a pre-existing cell into two, the nucleus of the mother cell\r\nfirst dividing and then the rest of the cell. “Every cell originates by\r\nthe fission of a preceding cell” is the law, and to that is added,\r\n“Every individual organism, plant or animal, itself originates from a\r\nsingle cell, the fertilised germ-cell.” These are two laws of\r\nfundamental importance in the study of living things. They are true of\r\nman as well as of the smallest worm; of the biggest tree as well as of\r\nthe most insignificant moss or water-weed. When the fertilised egg-cell\r\ndivides, and its progeny keep on dividing and growing in bulk by the\r\nconversion of nutriment into protoplasm, the dividing cells do not\r\nnecessarily become entirely nipped off from one another. In large tracts\r\nof cells (or tissues) we often find that the neighbouring cells are\r\nconnected to one another by excessively fine filaments of protoplasm.\r\nOnly twenty years ago it was supposed, whilst the neighbouring cells\r\nwere thus connected as a rule in animals, as well as being often\r\nconnected to the finest nerve-filaments, yet that in plants the firm,\r\nbox-like cases which surround the protoplasm—and when seen dried and\r\nempty by Robert Hook led him to introduce the word “cell” to describe\r\nthem—form completely shut cases, so that the living protoplasm of each\r\nplant-cell is entirely cut off from its neighbour. This has now been\r\nfound by improved methods of microscopic examination to be a mistake.\r\nThe cell-wall in a great many plants, though so firm and cleanly cut in\r\nappearance, is yet perforated by fine threads of the cell protoplasm, so\r\nthat each cell is in living communication with its neighbour. Thus, in\r\nplants as well as in animals, the individual cell-units form a more or\r\nless continuous whole of living matter, separated by dead, inert\r\ncell-walls and products of cell activity; but, nevertheless, connected\r\nin definite tracts and regions to one another by continuity of the\r\nliving matter in the form of excessively fine threads.\r\n\r\nThose animals and plants which are built up of many cells of many\r\nvarieties—that is to say, all but the microscopic unicellular\r\nkinds—may be considered as composite organisms—cell-states or\r\ncommunities in which the individual cells, all derived from one original\r\nmother-cell, are the citizens, living in groups and habitations\r\n(tissues), having their different occupations and capacities, carrying\r\non distinct operations and working together for the common good, the\r\n“life,” as we call it, of the individual plant or animal which they\r\nconstitute. This comparison should serve merely as an illustration of\r\nthe individual character and co-ordinated activity of the cells of a\r\nmany-celled plant or animal. It must not be forgotten that the separate\r\ncells are all derived by binary division from the original germ-cell,\r\nthat they have not come into juxtaposition from distinct sources, but\r\noften are held together by threads of their living material, which\r\nremain after the process of division of one cell into two.\r\n\r\nProtoplasm has been called “the physical basis of life.” Since the\r\nactivities to which we give the name “life” reside in protoplasm, and\r\nare chemical and physical activities like those of other bodies, even\r\nthough more subtle and complicated—we are justified in regarding\r\nprotoplasm as the substance in us and other organisms which “lives.”\r\nDeath consists in the destruction—the chemical undoing or decomposition\r\nof protoplasm.[3] In simple microscopic unicellular animals and plants,\r\nthis is obvious—so long as the protoplasm retains its chemical\r\nstructure it is not “dead.” Thus, it is possible with many small simple\r\norganisms—such as animalcules and the seeds of plants—to dry them, and\r\nto expose them to extreme cold, and to deprive them (by aid of a vacuum\r\npump) of all access of free oxygen or other gases. All chemical change\r\nis thus necessarily arrested. But the atomic structure of the chemical\r\nmolecules in the protoplasm is not destroyed. Sir James Dewar, M.\r\nBecquerel, and others have shown this by most carefully conducted\r\nexperiments. Seeds of clover, mustard, and wheat so treated do not\r\n“die”; the mechanism remains intact, and when, after many weeks, the\r\nseeds are moistened, warmed, and admitted to contact with the\r\natmosphere, the mechanism again begins to work, the protoplasm resumes\r\nits activity, the seed “sprouts.” Similarly Dewar has shown that\r\nbacteria are not killed by extreme cold, the temperature of liquid\r\nhydrogen. When thus frozen they remain inert—but are even in this\r\ncondition liable to be “killed” by exposure to the blue and ultra-blue\r\nrays of sunlight! Life was defined by Herbert Spencer as “the\r\n‘continuous’ adjustment of internal to external relations,” and this\r\nimplied that what is called “suspended animation” was not really a\r\npossible thing, but that there could only be an apparent or approximate\r\nsuspension. On the contrary, it seems that just as we may stop a watch\r\nby holding back the balance-wheel with a needle, and yet not “kill” the\r\nwatch—for it will resume its movement as soon as the needle is\r\nremoved—so the changes of the chemical molecules of protoplasm can be\r\narrested, but if the chemical “structure” is uninjured the mechanism of\r\nprotoplasm can resume its activity when the arresting causes are\r\nremoved. The inactive, unchanging protoplasm is not “dead,” it has not\r\nbeen “killed” so long as its mechanism is intact.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is the fact that this mechanism—the chemical\r\nstructure of protoplasm—is very easily destroyed. A unicellular\r\norganism is chemically destroyed by crushing or disruption, and the\r\nconsequent admixture of an excess of water with its particles, also by a\r\ntemperature high enough to cause pain if applied to our skin, but yet\r\nmuch below that of boiling water, also by strong sun-light, and by very\r\nmany varieties of chemical substances, especially acids, even when very\r\nmuch diluted. Complex animals and plants are liable to have the\r\nprotoplasm of essential and important cells of the body destroyed,\r\nwhereupon the destruction or death of the other cells, not involved in\r\nthe original trouble, frequently and as a rule results. The protoplasm\r\nof the cells of a complex animal is dependent on the proper activity of\r\nmany other cells besides those of its own tissue or locality in the\r\nbody. If the protoplasm of certain nerve-cells or of blood-cells or of\r\ndigestive-cells is poisoned or injured or chemically upset, other cells\r\nlose as a consequence—not at once but after a short interval—their\r\nnecessary chemical food, their oxygen, their accustomed temperature, and\r\nso bit by bit the great “body”—the complex organism—ceases to live,\r\nthat is to say, its protoplasm undergoes step by step and bit by bit\r\nirrevocable chemical change or breaking down.\r\n\r\nWhen a man enters upon that condition which we call “death,” the general\r\nmuscular movements first cease, then the movements of respiration (so\r\nthat a mirror held to the mouth was used to test the coming and going of\r\nthe breath, and the absence of a film of moisture on the mirror’s\r\nsurface was held to be a proof of death), then the movement of the\r\nheart, which is followed by the awful pallor of the bloodless face and\r\nlips, and the chilling of the whole body, no longer warmed by the\r\nblood-stream. But for long after these changes have occurred the\r\nprotoplasm of the cells in many parts is not injured. The beard of a\r\ncorpse will grow after all the great arrests of movement above noted\r\nhave been established for hours. In cold-blooded animals, such as the\r\nfrog, the protoplasm of the muscles is still uninjured many hours after\r\ndecapitation, and they can be stimulated and made to contract. Death, in\r\nfact, only occurs in the tissues of a multicellular animal, as their\r\nprotoplasm becomes chemically destroyed by injurious temperature,\r\npoisonous accumulations, or active bacterial germs, which become\r\npredominant owing to the stoppage of the great mechanisms of breathing,\r\ncirculation, and nerve control.\r\n\r\nIs it, then, necessary to suppose that a something, an essence, a\r\nspirit, an intangible existence called “life” or “vitality,” or the\r\n“anima animans,” passes away, or, as it were, evaporates from a thing\r\nwhich was living and is now dead? Assuredly no more than it is necessary\r\nto suppose that an essence or thing called “death” takes possession of\r\nit when it ceases to carry on the changes which we call “living.” It\r\nmust not be supposed that we regard the unique and truly awe-inspiring\r\nprocesses which go on in the protoplasm of living things as something\r\nsimple, easily understood and accounted for, because we have given up\r\nthe notion that life is an entity which enters into living things from\r\nwithout and escapes from them at death. The real fact is, that the\r\nnotion of “spirits,” whether of a lower or of a higher kind, supposed to\r\nenter into and “affect” various natural objects, including trees,\r\nrivers, and mountains, as well as animals and man, does not help us, and\r\nonly stands in the way of our gaining more complete knowledge of natural\r\nprocesses. When we say that life and even its most tremendous\r\noutcome—the mind of man—are to be studied and their gradual\r\ndevelopment traced as part of the orderly unfolding of natural\r\nprocesses, we are no whit less reverent, in no degree less impressed by\r\nthe wonder, immensity, and mystery of the universe, than those who, with\r\nhappy and obstinate adherence to primitive conceptions, think that they\r\ncan explain things by calling up vital essences and wandering spirits.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[3] Protoplasm is not a single chemical compound; it is the name given\r\nto the soft, slimy substance of cells, and contains many chemical\r\ncompounds—proteids, fats, and others; some on the way to assume greater\r\nchemical complexity; others in process of destruction. The critical\r\nhighest chemical body concealed in protoplasm has no generally\r\nrecognised name. It is a proteid-like body, consisting chiefly of\r\ncarbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, with some saline constituents.\r\nThis is the real ultimate “living matter,” and I suggested in the\r\n_Encyclopedia Britannica_ (article Protozoa) in 1886 that it should be\r\ncalled “plasmogen.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY AND PROTOPLASM\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the chemist examines living cell-substance or protoplasm—as free\r\nas possible from dead envelopes and products of its own activity—so as\r\nto make out, if he can, what it is chemically, he finds that it consists\r\nof the elements carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, with some\r\nsulphur. Phosphorus and some potash, soda and lime in small quantity,\r\nare also very usually associated with the elements named. These are\r\ncombined in the protoplasm so as to form chemical compounds resembling\r\nand including white of egg, and are called “proteids.” A chemical\r\ncompound is a very definite and special thing, and when one says\r\nso-and-so is a definite chemical compound, one means that it is not a\r\nmere “mixture,” but is composed of chemical elements (some out of the\r\nlong list of about eighty indestructible, undecomposable, “simple”\r\nbodies—gases, liquids, metallic and non-metallic solids—recognised by\r\nchemists and known as such), peculiarly united to, or “combined” with,\r\none another in definite proportions by weight.\r\n\r\nTake, as an example, water. Water is a definite chemical compound,\r\nformed by the chemical union of two pure elements, the gases hydrogen\r\nand oxygen—eighteen ounces of water consist of two ounces of hydrogen\r\nand sixteen ounces of oxygen. At a temperature above that of boiling\r\nwater the gases, when they unite, contract to form water-vapour, three\r\npints of the uniting gases (consisting of two pints of hydrogen and one\r\nof oxygen) forming two pints only of water-vapour. This, when it is\r\ncooled to a temperature below 212 deg. Fahr., suddenly contracts to a\r\nfew thimblefuls of pure liquid water. Neither oxygen nor hydrogen\r\n“uncombined” liquefy till far below zero.\r\n\r\nA proteid, in the same way, is a chemical combination of the elements\r\nalready mentioned—carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulphur—but\r\nthe proportions by volume of these elements to each other are\r\nrepresented by very high figures, not merely by two to one, as in the\r\ncase of water. It is the carbon in them that makes “proteids” turn black\r\nwhen they are destroyed by burning, and it is the sulphur which causes\r\nthe smell of rotten eggs. Whilst an ultimate molecule or physical\r\nparticle of water consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one of\r\noxygen—the molecule of the proteid called “albumen” is built up by\r\nseventy-two atoms of carbon, one hundred and twelve atoms of hydrogen,\r\neighteen atoms of nitrogen, twelve atoms of oxygen, all brought into\r\nrelation with one atom of sulphur. Probably in some other proteids the\r\nnumber of these atoms must all be multiplied by three. The elaborate\r\n“atomic composition” of a molecule of proteid renders it very unstable;\r\nit easily falls to pieces, the elements combining, in other and simpler\r\nproportions, to form less “delicate” bodies. Living protoplasm consists\r\nchiefly of proteids and of compounds which are on the way up, forming\r\nstep by step more elaborate combinations till they reach the proteid\r\nstage—and of many others which are degradation products, coming down,\r\nas it were, from the giddy heights of the proteid combination. The\r\nprotoplasm of a cell contains finer and grosser granules, which are\r\nthese ascending and descending substances; it also contains others in\r\nsolution and invisible—for, like a lump of jelly (such as the cook\r\nserves up shaped by a mould and soaked with flavour and colour),\r\nprotoplasm can soak up either a large or a small quantity of water, and\r\nwith the water (that is the important point) all sorts of chemical\r\nbodies soluble in water. Just as a lump of quivering calves’-foot jelly\r\n(which is a chemical compound of a lower grade than proteids, but like\r\nthem), when placed in a shallow dish of water coloured red by carmine,\r\ndoes not dissolve in the water, but absorbs the water and the carmine,\r\nallowing the coloured water and any chemical bodies in solution in it to\r\ndiffuse into and become physically, though not chemically, a part of its\r\nsubstance, so protoplasm takes up water and the compounds dissolved by\r\nit. Just as a “jelly” of water-holding gelatine can give up its water\r\nand become hard and horny, so is protoplasm capable of gradually giving\r\nup much of its water, and even in some cases of becoming hard and horny,\r\nyet able to return, when remoistened, to its active state. Moreover, a\r\n“jelly” can be made to “soak up” or take into itself water and let it\r\npass through its substance, so as to wash out from it all soluble\r\nmatters. In the same way the protoplasm of a living cell is supplied\r\nwith nourishing and oxygenating fluids which diffuse into it, and is\r\n“washed out,” purified, and cleansed of waste or effete chemical\r\ncompounds by the water which first permeates it, and then diffuses out\r\nof it into surrounding watery fluids carrying the excess of soluble\r\nchemical bodies with it.\r\n\r\nWhilst proteids are the compounds of the highest stage of chemical\r\ncomplexity recognised in protoplasm, and appear to form the bulk of its\r\nsubstance, we must carefully avoid the error (which is not uncommon) of\r\nsupposing that protoplasm is itself a definite chemical compound. It is\r\nnot. Cell-protoplasm includes the nucleus, that denser central body: and\r\nis a structure consisting of “proteids” and of many granules and\r\ndust-like particles, and of more and of less liquid or watery parts\r\nwhich are less complex in chemical nature than are proteids. Some of the\r\nvisible granules and invisible liquids present in protoplasm are being\r\nbuilt up to the proteid stage of elaboration, whilst some are steps in\r\ndegradation and decomposition. We have no reason to suppose that the\r\nmolecules of any proteid known at present to the chemist really are the\r\nhighest degree of chemical complexity attained to in living protoplasm.\r\nProbably there is present a further stage of elaboration, a chemical\r\nbody even more complex than is “proteid,” which is continually\r\nattracting the lower chemical compounds to itself and as continually\r\nbreaking down. This is the ultimate chemical substance of life. It is\r\nhidden invisibly in the protoplasm, yet all the chemical changes which\r\ngo on in the protoplasm of a cell are either leading up to this supreme\r\nlife-stuff or are leading downwards from it. This ultimate compound,\r\nwhich we suppose to exist but have not demonstrated, has been called\r\n“plasmogen.” It is this body in which resides the peculiar property of\r\nliving matter, namely, that of attracting to itself substances\r\ncontaining the so-called “organic” elements—carbon, oxygen, hydrogen,\r\nand nitrogen—and of acting on them in such a way that they “nourish”\r\nit—that is to say, combine chemically with it to form more “plasmogen.”\r\n\r\nThe intermediate steps leading up to plasmogen and the products arising\r\nfrom its incessant breaking down are formed under the influence of this\r\nunique chemical body, and by it alone. Chemists have not yet succeeded\r\nin making them; only the less elaborate kinds have been “artificially”\r\nconstructed without the aid of the living plasmogen. To construct\r\nplasmogen itself is a task for the chemists of the distant future. In\r\nearly geological ages plasmogen came into being; it has gone on ever\r\nsince “nourishing” itself, maintaining itself, growing and spreading\r\nover the earth. It is improbable that the conditions which led to its\r\nformation have ever recurred. All subsequent plasmogen has been formed\r\nby the growth and increase of that first sample of it, which once in a\r\nremote period of the earth’s history was built up by chemical\r\nconditions, which came to an end as soon as they had produced it.\r\n\r\nThe only process in nature of which we know, which resembles the\r\n“building” action of plasmogen, the ultimate molecule of life, buried in\r\nthe cell’s protoplasm, is the selective action of crystals, which draw\r\nto themselves from a solution or magma of all sorts of chemical bodies\r\nthose molecules of a chemical nature identical with their own, and build\r\nthem up into special and definite crystalline forms. But there is a very\r\nwide gap between this process and even the mere assimilation by living\r\nmatter of the organic elements, so as to raise them from a lower to a\r\nhigher grade of chemical complexity of combination. And over and above\r\nthis we have added, in the case of living material, to the mere power of\r\nassimilation and growth the almost unthinkable complications and\r\nvariations of specific form and quality, and yet further of individual\r\nform and quality, which are determined by special complications and\r\nvariations of the plasmogen, that unique compound concealed in the\r\ncell-protoplasm.\r\n\r\nWe cannot at present, if ever, picture to ourselves adequately the\r\nmechanism of plasmogen, though the attempt has been, and must be, made.\r\nBut we can watch its workings closely; we can ascertain the conditions\r\nwhich promote, check, or modify its activity; in fact, we can observe\r\nits output and experiment on it in a thousand ways, and so get more and\r\nmore knowledge of it. We are not led to suppose that it is possessed by\r\na demon, nor that in it resides an elsewhere unknown essence. It is\r\nenough for us to satisfy ourselves that its qualities, whilst they can\r\nbe grouped with the chemical and physical qualities of other bodies, so\r\nfar transcend them in complexity and in immensity of result—the whole\r\ncreation of plant and animal life—that their appearance constitutes in\r\neffect a new departure, a sudden and, to us, unaccountable acquirement.\r\nBut then we must remember that it is also an unaccountable thing to us\r\nthat water suddenly becomes ice at a low temperature, and suddenly\r\nbecomes vapour at a high temperature, even if we are able to imagine the\r\nmechanism which necessitates those changes. We cannot “explain” the\r\nnature of things. Even though we can classify them and arrange them in\r\norder, and more or less satisfactorily guess what their inner mechanism\r\nis, we cannot, in our present state of knowledge, trace them in detail\r\nto a first beginning. Even though we believe that such a history lies\r\nbehind us, we ourselves cannot as yet show how exactly every quality and\r\nproperty and form of matter has developed in due order as a matter of\r\nnecessity during the cooling of the cosmic gas. All we can do is to\r\nascertain, bit by bit, some sequences, some lines of orderly development\r\nand interaction, adding thus step by step to our knowledge of what has\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nTHE SIMPLEST LIVING THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn old times, if one wanted to compare a man to the humblest and\r\nsimplest of animals, one called him “a worm.” But really a worm is a\r\nvery elaborate creature, with skin, muscles, blood-vessels, kidneys,\r\nnervous system, pharynx, stomach, and an intestine, and is built up by\r\nhundreds of thousands of protoplasmic cells. Shakespeare got nearer the\r\nmark when he made one of his uncompromising professional “murderers”\r\nexclaim, as he stabbed the young Macduff to the heart, “What, you egg!”\r\nAn egg is a single cell or corpuscle of protoplasm, and the simplest\r\nliving things are of the same structure—mere units, single corpuscles\r\nof protoplasm, often less than the one-thousandth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and invisible except with the microscope, though in some cases\r\nbig enough to be seen by the naked eye as they swim or crawl in a glass\r\nof pond-water. Many thousands of kinds of these simplest animals and\r\nplants have been carefully recorded, distinguished from one another, and\r\nnamed by naturalists.\r\n\r\nMany of these unicellular animals (or “Protozoa”) crawl by a curious\r\nirregular flowing movement of the viscid tenacious protoplasm of which\r\nthey consist. There is no firm coat or cell-wall, only the thinnest\r\npellicle on the surface. The Proteus-animalcule (Fig. 36A) is so called\r\nbecause of its constant change of shape; it is also called Amœba on\r\nthis account. It flows out into broad, sometimes elongated, finger-like\r\nprocesses, of which one or several of different sizes may be formed at\r\nthe same time, and then quickly disappear as the whole creature moves.\r\nSolid particles of food—minute unicellular plants—are engulfed by the\r\nmoving viscid protoplasm and digested within it—that is to say,\r\nchemically dissolved, just as food is digested in the stomach of a big\r\nanimal. The colourless cells of our blood and lymph (Fig. 36B) are\r\ncalled “amœboid,” because of their identity with an Amœba in shape\r\nand movement and digestive power. In some of these animalcules\r\n(sun-animalcules and others) the processes of the protoplasm are in the\r\nform of very fine, long spreading threads which entangle a food\r\nparticle, and then contract, drawing it up into the disc-like central\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nA whole group or division of these simplest animals are provided with\r\nspecial moving or vibrating hair-like extensions of the protoplasm\r\ncalled “cilia,” that being the Latin name for “eyelashes,” to which they\r\nare compared. These cilia are arranged with great regularity in rows,\r\ncirclets, or spirals, on the surface of the “cell.” They are found not\r\nonly on cells which are independent unicellular animals and plants, but\r\nalso on cells which form the clothing or surface layer of many larger\r\nanimals (Fig. 40A and B). Thus, in ourselves, they are found lining the\r\nwindpipe, and they also line the internal cavity of the brain and spinal\r\ncord. The gills of the oyster, and such shell-fish, and other parts of\r\ntheir skin, are paved with ciliated or cilia-bearing cells, set side by\r\nside in thousands. A single “cilium” is like a little lash of a whip,\r\nand is always making its lashing movement. For a fraction of a second it\r\nis straight and upright, then suddenly curves over and bends to one side\r\nwith a “flick,” and immediately recovers its upright position (see Fig.\r\n29, p. 131). All the cilia on one cell or one surface “beat” in the same\r\ndirection, and with a common rhythm, so that if the cell is a free,\r\nindependent animalcule it is driven along through the water by the rapid\r\nstrokes of these numberless tiny “oars,” or “paddles.” If the cilia are\r\non a surface—like the oyster’s gill—they drive the water along and\r\ncreate a constant current. Each cilium consists of an elastic and a\r\ncontractile fibre closely fused together: the contraction of the one\r\npart causes a flick or bending of the hair-like cilium, the elasticity\r\nof the other substance causes it at once to straighten out again.\r\n\r\nThe ciliated unicellular animalcules (often called the infusoria,\r\nbecause they flourish in decomposing “infusions”) not only swim by means\r\nof their cilia, but have a definite mouth or opening in the firm outer\r\nlayer of the protoplasm of the cell, into which solid particles of food\r\nare driven by whirlpool-like currents set up by special lines of cilia\r\n(Fig. 41A_a_). The mouth leads through a definite “gullet” into the\r\ninterior of the cell. Remember that the whole creature is but a single\r\nminute cell or corpuscle of protoplasm! It is only from the hundredth to\r\nthe thousandth of an inch long—with nucleus (_e_ in the figure) of\r\ndenser structure within—just like, in essential structure and\r\nproperties, one single cell of the many thousands which build up the\r\nliver, or are packed in layers to form our outer skin, or are piled side\r\nby side (by self-division) to make the stems and leaves of plants. Yet\r\nhere is such a cell—self-sufficing. When it divides (as it does) the\r\ntwo resulting cells do not remain in contact as they do when a germ cell\r\n(a fertilised egg-cell) divides. They simply separate, and each swims\r\naway, and carries on its own life. Many of them are fitted out with\r\nthese cilia as a most serviceable locomotor apparatus, and as producers\r\nof food currents driving the food right in to a permanent,\r\ndefinitely-shaped mouth. Some have also a separate opening by which the\r\nundigested remains of the food are extruded. They have also a\r\nliquid-holding cavity or series of cavities which, when distended,\r\ncontract and discharge their contents to the exterior. This is an\r\napparatus for “washing out” the protoplasm of the unicellular animalcule\r\nand getting rid of excretory products; it is definitely comparable in\r\nits use, though so different in origin, to the many-celled kidneys and\r\nbladder of higher animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.—Two specimens of a bell-animalcule\r\n(_Vorticella_). A, extended. B, with retracted disc and coiled stalk.\r\n_a_, the ciliated disc; _b_, the firm ring behind the disc, called\r\n“peristome”; _c_, the pulsating chamber, called often the contractile\r\nvacuole; _d_, a completely digested particle of food on its way to be\r\ncast out through the gullet; _e_, the sausage-shaped nucleus; _f_, a\r\nparticle of food which has just sunk into the protoplasm from the\r\ngullet, and is surrounded by a little water; _g_, the gullet; _h_, the\r\nreservoir leading from the pulsating chamber to the gullet; _i_, the\r\nhollow stalk; _k_, the spirally attached muscle within the stalk; _l_,\r\nthe attachment of the stalk to a weed _m_.]\r\n\r\nOne of the numerous kinds of “bell-animalcules” affords an excellent\r\nexample in which we can watch the structures and life-processes in a\r\nsingle cell (Fig. 41). It is a pear or bell-shaped body, little more\r\nthan one-thousandth of an inch broad, supported on a long, hollow stalk\r\n(though sometimes it breaks off from its stalk and swims freely); inside\r\nthe stalk is a muscle (_k_), so attached that when it contracts it\r\nshortens the stalk by throwing it into a close-set, corkscrew spiral\r\n(Fig. 41B). The bell-shaped body has a relatively firm surface, beneath\r\nwhich is soft, viscid protoplasm and a large sausage-like nucleus. The\r\nbody can expand itself so as to look like a solid bell or trumpet-shaped\r\nfigure, with a flat, disc-like surface where the “hollow” of the bell\r\nshould be, or it can draw the edges of the disc together and assume the\r\nshape of a ball. A line of “cilia” is set on the edge of the bell’s disc\r\n(_a_) and takes a spiral course.\r\n\r\nThere is a deep pit on one side of the disc. This is the mouth. It is\r\neasy to feed this minute “egg” of a creature! A powder of fine\r\nparticles—boiled bacteria, in fact, are what I have used—is introduced\r\ninto the water between two slips of glass in which the bell-animalcule\r\nis displaying itself under our microscope. We see the particles whirling\r\nabout in a vortex, hitting the disc of the bell-animalcule and then\r\ndriven into the pit or cavity of the open mouth, whence they sink,\r\nenclosed in a sphere or droplet of water (_f_) into the internal\r\nprotoplasm! If the “boiled bacteria,” before they are introduced, are\r\nstained with an alkaline blue, such as blue litmus, they are seen in the\r\ncourse of a few seconds to turn red—showing that an acid has been\r\nsecreted by the protoplasm (probably accompanied by a ferment) into the\r\nlittle sphere of water, in which the digestion of the boiled bacteria\r\nnow goes on. In the course of a few minutes you will see the little\r\nsphere of water dwindling in size—the nourishing liquid being absorbed\r\nby the protoplasm—and then you will see the undigested fragments passed\r\non by a slow movement to the vestibule or “pit” of the mouth, extruded\r\nthrough a temporary opening from the protoplasm, and whirled away by the\r\nwater currents! If you colour the “boiled bacteria” with water-soluble\r\nanilin-blue—as I did many years ago—you will see that the colour\r\nvanishes from the particles taken into the bell-animalcule’s protoplasm,\r\nand presently an independent sphere of bright blue liquid begins to form\r\nin the protoplasm. This sphere or globule is the renal organ mentioned\r\nabove—here very simple and single (Fig. 40_c_). It is called the\r\npulsating chamber or “contractile vacuole.” It enlarges rapidly, filling\r\nwith blue liquid (when special coloured food has not been supplied the\r\nliquid is colourless), then suddenly contracts, squirting its blue\r\ncontents out through a special reservoir (_h_) into the mouth-pit (as\r\nshown by an arrow in the figure).\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of these unicellular animals is often elongated (_e_), and\r\nshaped according to the general shape of the animalcule; but it is the\r\nsame thing as the “nucleus” of all cells, whether of plants or\r\nanimals—a denser “kernel” of protoplasm, limited by its own delicate\r\nsheath or membrane. It shows, like the cell-nucleus of ordinary cells, a\r\nspecial affinity for certain dyes, which do not stain the rest of the\r\ncell, so that it can be made very obvious and clear when the animalcule\r\nis killed by alcohol, picric acid, or other preservative solutions, and\r\nthen stained; and it shows a curious breaking-up of its substance into\r\nthread-like fibres when the animalcule is about to divide into two—as\r\nis seen also in all cells when the regular process of division of one\r\ncell into two commences. The larger animalcules have enabled us to find\r\nout what are the special properties of the nucleus of cells, as\r\ncontrasted with those of the rest of the protoplasm. The trumpet\r\nanimalcule (Stentor) is a single cell, and though only one-thirtieth of\r\nan inch long, is large enough to be cut into pieces by very skilful use\r\nof a fine blade. It is found that, if we cut the Stentor into four or\r\nfive bits, all continue to “live”; that is to say, to swim about by the\r\nvibration of the hair-like cilia on their surface. But those bits which\r\nhave no part of the nucleus in them die after a few hours. They cannot\r\ntake nourishment nor grow. On the other hand, all the bits which\r\ncomprise a slice of nucleus commence to contract, and shape themselves\r\nlike the original Stentor, then form a mouth, and take nourishment, and\r\ngrow up to be fully-sized, complete Stentors—animalcules like that by\r\nthe cutting-up of which they were formed. This and similar experiments\r\nare held to prove that the processes of nutrition, growth, and\r\nproduction of specific form are dependent on the nucleus. In its\r\nabsence, you may have contractility and active movement for a time, but\r\nno repair, no building-up of new material, no directed or seemingly\r\n“purposive” movement. Such movements, viz., advance in one direction,\r\narrest, hesitating, or exploring movement to the right and left,\r\nfollowed by rapid retreat or advance in a straight line, are often\r\nexhibited by these minute animalcules, and cannot be distinguished in\r\ncharacter from those, say, of a fly or even of a mouse.\r\n\r\nThese facts throw a great light on the significance of the structure of\r\nthe protoplasmic corpuscle which we call a “cell,” and show that the\r\nuniversal presence of the nucleus in every “cell” is due to the fact\r\nthat it plays the most important part in the life of the cell. It is the\r\nseat of control, and contains substances in virtue of which the changes\r\nwhich constitute growth and form-production take place, and in the\r\nabsence of which the rest of the protoplasm cannot “carry on,” although\r\nfor a time it lives; that is to say, remains chemically undecomposed,\r\nand shows active movement. At the same time, we must not underrate the\r\nimportance of the general protoplasm, without the presence of some of\r\nwhich the nucleus cannot do its work, nor even exist. It is no wonder,\r\nthen, that when a cell divides, there are curious and elaborate\r\nproceedings in the nucleus, by which each daughter cell gets its due\r\nhalf of the all-important nuclear substance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.—Six successive stages in the division of a\r\n“cell,” to show the appearance of the V-shaped filaments of colourable\r\nmatter or chromatin. _a_, resting-cell, with chromatin dispersed as fine\r\nirregular filaments in the nucleus; _b_, the chromatin takes the form of\r\na wreath with twelve loops—it lies horizontally across the cell; _c_,\r\nthe loops break from one another, and form twelve separate V-shaped\r\npieces; _d_, each of the twelve pieces divides along its length into two\r\nparallel V-shaped pieces; _e_, the divided pieces now separate from one\r\nanother, so as to form two wreath-like groups of twelve V-shaped pieces\r\nat each end of the cell; _f_, the wall of the cell forms across between\r\nthe separated groups of V-shaped pieces, which lose their regular\r\narrangement. Each group becomes enclosed in a capsule, and is the\r\nnucleus of a new cell. This is the regular process of cell-division, and\r\nthe mode in which the chromatin of the nucleus is broken up, so as to be\r\nequally shared by the two daughter cells. In some species of animals the\r\ncells have as many as thirty-six V-shaped chromatin bodies; in others as\r\nfew as two. Different plants also show a similar difference in the\r\nnumber of chromatin bodies characteristic of the species.]\r\n\r\nWhen a cell divides the fission or splitting of the cell is preceded by\r\npeculiar changes in the nucleus. There is a material in the nucleus of\r\nevery cell—of those which are simple animalcules, as well as of those\r\nwhich are germ-cells and sperm-cells, and of those which form, heaped up\r\nin enormous numbers, the living substance of larger animals and\r\nplants—a material which is an elaborated sort of proteid (see p. 185)\r\nand stains strongly with carmine, logwood, and such dyes, and is called\r\n“chromatin.” It exists often in the shape of minute granules and\r\nfilaments (Fig. 42_a_), but always takes on, sooner or later, the form\r\nof an irregularly undulated thread or threads. When the cell is about to\r\ndivide into two—as all growing and active cells do—the thread arranges\r\nitself like a zigzagging girdle around the equator of the globular\r\nnucleus (Fig. 42_b_). The margin of the nucleus then seems to melt away\r\ninto the general protoplasm, and the zigzag bits of the stainable thread\r\nbreak from each other, forming a ring-like group of V-shaped pieces\r\n(Fig. 42_c_). There is a remarkable fact as to the number of these\r\nV-shaped pieces. They are identical in number in all the cells of one\r\nspecies or kind of animal or plant, but may be of a different number in\r\nallied species. The salamander has twenty-four of them; some worms have\r\nonly two, some insects thirty-six, some plants eight, others twelve, and\r\nso on. When the V-shaped pieces have thus taken up their position in the\r\ndividing cell, each splits longitudinally, so as to form two V-shaped\r\npieces lying one over the other (Fig. 42_d_). Then the halves separate\r\nand travel away from each other. In this way two circlets, each made up\r\nby the correct number of V-shaped pieces, come into place at opposite\r\nsides of the cell (Fig. 42_e_). After this the protoplasm becomes nipped\r\nin between the two circlets so as to separate the cell into two halves,\r\neach with its circlet of exactly the correct number of V-shaped pieces\r\nof “chromatin” formed by the splitting of those of the parent cell (Fig.\r\n42_f_). It is in this way that the nuclei of the new cells are\r\naccurately provided with not merely half of the nuclear chromatin of the\r\nmother cell, but with half taken from all parts of it, owing to the\r\nthread-like form of the chromatin and the longitudinal splitting of the\r\nthread.\r\n\r\nFertilisation of the egg-cell by the sperm-cell consists essentially in\r\nthe junction or fusion of the nuclear chromatin threads of the egg-cell\r\nwith the nuclear chromatin threads of a single sperm-cell or\r\nspermatozoon, which sinks into the egg-cell and fuses with it. This has\r\nbeen witnessed and studied with the greatest care. The leading fact of\r\ninterest is that the egg-cell and the sperm-cell have only half the\r\nnumber of V-shaped nuclear pieces which the ordinary cells of the same\r\nanimal or plant possess. Thus a salamander’s ripe egg and ripe\r\nspermatozoid have each only twelve V-shaped pieces—not twenty-four.\r\nThis is brought about by the parent cells, which divide to form the\r\negg-cell of the female and the spermatozoid of the male, not splitting\r\ntheir V-shaped nuclear bits; consequently, the number is reduced to\r\nhalf (that is, twelve) in the daughter cells resulting from the\r\ndivision. Accordingly, when the fusion of egg-cell and sperm-cell\r\noccurs—each bringing twelve V-shaped pieces—the proper number is\r\nre-established, namely, twenty-four. In the first division of this\r\nfertilised germ-cell—the cell resulting from the fusion of egg-cell and\r\nsperm-cell—the V-shaped nuclear pieces split in the regular way, and\r\nthe first two embryo-cells are formed, each with its twenty-four pieces.\r\nEach of these cells undergoes the regular process, and so by continued\r\ngrowth and division into two an immense series of cells are produced,\r\nwhich may separate as they form, or in the case of multi-cellular\r\ncreatures, remain in continuity with one another as a bulky plant or\r\nanimal. Clearly the whole process arises from the value to the growing\r\nmass of protoplasm of having its substance closely sown or dotted with\r\ncentres of nuclear matter—that specially active, co-ordinating\r\nmaterial—and of having those centres of equal volume and quality; and,\r\nlastly, of having that nuclear matter equally, or nearly equally,\r\nderived from the male and female parent. It is, however, not certain\r\nfrom observation of what occurs when the twelve male and twelve female\r\nV-shaped pieces (or whatever the number may be in any given animal or\r\nplant which have become grouped together in the fertilised germ-cell)\r\nsplit and separate to form the nucleus of two new cells—that exactly\r\ntwelve male and twelve female pieces go into each of the new cells. It\r\nis certain that twenty-four pieces go into each, but although it is\r\npossible that exactly half of them are male and half female in origin,\r\nit is not certain from observation that this is necessarily so.\r\nSupposing different proportions to obtain in each of the two first\r\nembryo-cells, it would help to account for the facts that offspring are\r\nnot an exact blend of their parents in all their qualities, and that\r\nall the offspring of the same two parents are not exactly alike, but\r\noften very different from one another.\r\n\r\nSome of the simplest living things, consisting of but one microscopic\r\ncell, are animals, and some are plants. The essential difference between\r\nan animal and a plant is shown very clearly by some of these microscopic\r\ncreatures. Animals feed on the flesh or “proteid” substances\r\nmanufactured by other animals or by plants; they also feed on oils or\r\nfats, and on the sugar and starch manufactured by other animals or by\r\nplants. But they cannot construct these “foods” themselves from the\r\nsimpler stable chemical compounds called “mineral bodies,” which,\r\nnevertheless, contain the elements they require—carbon, nitrogen,\r\nhydrogen, and oxygen. Such stable mineral bodies are carbonic acid,\r\nammonia, and water. In fact, ordinary “smelling salts” (which is\r\nchemically carbonate of ammonia) dissolved in water, if we add to it a\r\ntrace of phosphates, sulphates, and chlorides of potash, soda and lime,\r\ncontain all the actual chemical elements that an animal needs. Yet no\r\nanimal can be nourished by such a “mineral” soup.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is the special distinction of plants—of green\r\nplants, be it noted—that they can feed on this simple diet, and,\r\nmoreover, cannot feed on anything else. The green colouring matter which\r\ngives its beautiful tint to the grass and weeds and the leaves of the\r\nbig trees which clothe the earth is absolutely essential in this\r\nprocess; so also is sunlight. The living protoplasm of the\r\ngreen-coloured parts of plants is crowded with microscopic discs or\r\nplates of a brilliant transparent green colour. The peculiar substance\r\ncausing the colour is called “leaf-green,” or “chlorophyll.” It can be\r\ndissolved out of a leaf, not by water, but by spirit or by ether, and\r\nseparately studied. It may be seen in solution (to cite a commercial\r\ninstance) in the liqueur known as “crême de menthe,” being used to give\r\nits fine green colour to that preparation. Sunlight shining on to the\r\ngreen parts of plants is “screened” or “strained” by the leaf-green, so\r\nthat only some of the coloured rays pass through it, and it is only by\r\nthis peculiarly “strained” green sunlight that the protoplasm of the\r\ncells of the leaf is stimulated to its remarkable chemical activity. The\r\ncarbonic acid in the air or in the water in which the green plant is\r\nliving is taken up by the protoplasm. Carbonic acid consists of oxygen\r\nand of carbon. The protoplasm, when the green sunlight acts on it,\r\nactually takes out of carbonic acid and throws off as a gas (seen as\r\nbubbles in the case of a water plant) some of its constituent oxygen,\r\nthus keeping up the supply of free oxygen in air and water. Then at the\r\nsame time it combines the carbon and the rest of the oxygen with water\r\n(hydrogen and oxygen) inside itself, forming solid starch, which, with\r\nthe microscope, we can see actually manufactured as little oblong grains\r\nin the green cells. Not only this, but the element nitrogen is, so to\r\nspeak, “forced” in other cells of the plant to combine with the three\r\nelements of the newly-formed starch (carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen), and\r\nthus the first steps leading to the building up of those wonderful\r\nbodies, the proteids, are passed. Nothing of the sort can be done by the\r\nprotoplasm of an animal cell.\r\n\r\nConsequently we distinguish among the simplest living things those which\r\nare provided with leaf-green, and feed, as do the larger green plants,\r\non dissolved “mineral” solids and gases. There are many thousands of\r\nkinds of them—single simple cells. Some are known to microscopists as\r\nDiatoms and Desmids—often of curious spindle or crescent-shape, others\r\nstar-like. The diatoms form on their surface a delicate,\r\nwonderfully-sculptured coat of glass-like silica (quartz), which\r\nresists destruction and persists long after the protoplasm is dead and\r\nwashed away. They are favourite objects for examination with the\r\nmicroscope on account of their great beauty and variety.\r\n\r\nThose simplest living things which have not got leaf-green to enable\r\nthem to feed on mineral food must—unless they are parasites (as many\r\nimportant kinds are)—get their food, as do bigger animals, by feeding\r\non the solid substance of other living things. All living things are, in\r\nfact, ultimately dependent on the green plants—whether microscopic or\r\nof larger kinds—not only for food, but for oxygen gas. If you could\r\ntake away green plants altogether from the world, the animals would eat\r\none another and use up the oxygen gas of the atmosphere, and at the last\r\nthere would be a few only of the strongest left, like the last survivor\r\nof the shipwrecked crew of the _Nancy Bell_, and even they would be\r\nsuffocating for want of oxygen. The single cells, which are independent\r\nanimalcules, and feed like animals on whole creatures smaller than\r\nthemselves, or on bits of the fresh substance of other animals or of\r\nplants, are of extraordinary diversity of form and activity. Unlike the\r\nunicellular plants, whose food is dissolved in the water in which they\r\nlive, the single-cell animals of necessity take their food in “lumps”\r\ninto their inside and digest it, and so their cell-protoplasm has either\r\na soft surface which can take up a food-morsel at any point or it has a\r\nfirm surface with a definite mouth, or aperture, in it (see Fig. 41)\r\nwhere the mouth is marked by an arrow. Many of them, especially those\r\nwith soft glutinous protoplasm, which extends from the main-mass in long\r\nthreads or branching processes searching for food-morsels, form\r\nmarvellous, perforated shells by chemical deposit, either of silica or\r\nlimestone (Radiolaria and Foraminifers). The kinds with a firm or tough\r\nsurface to the cell-protoplasm and a permanent mouth and gullet leading\r\ninto the cell-substance have very usually a single large lashing-whip\r\n(Flagellata), which drives them through the water in search of prey, or\r\nthey are clothed with hundreds of such lashing threads of smaller\r\nsize—the “cilia” described above (p. 195)—arranged in rows or circles,\r\nwhence these animalcules are called “Ciliata.” The ciliates or\r\none-celled animals are enabled by their cilia to move with all the\r\ngrace, variety, facility, and apparent intelligence of the highest\r\nanimals, and also to create powerful vortex-currents by which food\r\nparticles are driven into the cell-mouth.\r\n\r\nIt is a most remarkable and thought-stirring fact that here we have\r\n“animalcules” which are no more than isolated units of the kind and\r\nstructure which go by hundreds of thousands to build up a larger\r\nanimal—just as bricks are units of the kind which to the number of many\r\nthousands build up a house. And yet each of these free-living units has\r\na complete organisation—mouth, pharynx, renal organ, locomotive organs,\r\nand so on—similar in activity and general shape to the system of large,\r\ncapacious organs built up by the agglomeration of millions of cell-units\r\nto form the body of a higher animal. It is as though a single brick were\r\nprovided with door, windows, staircase, fireplace, chimneys, and\r\nwine-cellar! It is clear that there is only a resemblance and not an\r\nidentity of origin between the organs of the multicellular animal and\r\nthose of the single-celled animalcule. The history of the growth of an\r\nanimal from the single egg-cell, and also the series of existing\r\nmany-celled animals, leading from simple forms to the most complex,\r\nproves this. And in view of that fact the wonderful elaboration of these\r\ndiminutive creatures—many of them so small as to be absolutely\r\ninvisible to the naked eye—is all the more curious and impressive. We\r\nhave, in fact, parallel organisation and elaboration of structures with\r\nspecial uses, in two absolutely separated grades or strata of living\r\nthings—the one grade marked off by the limitation that only a single\r\ncell, a single nucleated corpuscle of protoplasm, is to be the basis and\r\nmaterial of elaboration—the other and higher grade permitting the use\r\nof millions of single cells, of endless variety and plasticity, capable\r\nof hanging together and being grouped in layers and tissues, in such\r\nenormous masses that an elephant or a whale is the result. And we see\r\nthat the same needs are met, not actually in the same way, but in the\r\nsame kind of way, in the two cases—the food-orifice, the cilia, and the\r\n“pulsating vacuole” of the unicellular animalcule do the same services\r\nas those done by the structurally different mouth, legs, and kidneys of\r\nthe elephant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nTADPOLES AND FROGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe season of tadpoles is not a season recognised by housekeepers and\r\ngourmets (except in France, where frogs are eaten in April), but one\r\ndear to schoolboys and all lovers of Nature. The ponds on heaths and in\r\nthe corners of meadows now show great masses of soft jelly-like balls of\r\nthe size of a marble, huddled together and marked each by a little black\r\nspot at its centre, as big as a rape-seed. This is the “spawn” of our\r\ncommon frog. The spawn of the common toad is very similar, but the black\r\nspots are set in long strings of jelly, not in separate balls. The\r\nlittle black body is precisely the same thing as the yellow part of a\r\nhen’s egg, and the jelly around it corresponds to the “white” of the\r\nbird’s egg; but there is nothing to represent the shell. The “yelk” of\r\nthe bird’s egg is, it is true, much larger, but corresponds to the black\r\nsphere of the frog’s egg—the actual germ—and is like the latter a\r\nsingle protoplasmic cell, distended with nourishing granular matter. It\r\nis the excess of this matter which makes the yellow ball of the bird’s\r\negg so much bigger than the black or rather deep-brown germ of the frog.\r\nThe little black spheres elongate from day to day in the warm spring\r\nweather, and at last the minute tadpoles (see Fig. 43 and its\r\nexplanation) break loose from the jelly, hanging on to its surface by\r\naid of a tiny sucker, and feeding on the minute green vegetable growths\r\nwhich have appeared all over the jelly-like mass. Their rate of growth\r\ndepends very much on the temperature, and is much more rapid in Italy\r\nand the South of France than in England. At first they are so small that\r\nit is difficult to distinguish, except with a pocket-lens, the little\r\nblack plume-like gills on each side of the head, and it is only as they\r\ngrow bigger and lose these little plumes that the young things assume\r\nthe characteristic shape of a rounded head—really head and body—with a\r\nlong flattened tail which strikes vigorously to the right and left, and\r\nenables the tadpole to swim like a fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.—Stages in the growth from the egg of the common\r\nfrog—drawn of the natural size. 1. Egg in its jelly-like envelope. 2.\r\nVery young tadpoles adhering to weed by their suckers (placed just below\r\nthe mouth). 3. Very young tadpole, showing two pair of external gills: a\r\nthird pair is present, but so small as to be invisible without\r\nmagnification. 4, 5, 6. Stages in the later growth of the tadpole: the\r\nexternal gills have disappeared, but the legs have not yet made their\r\nappearance. 7. Tadpole of full size, with fore and hind legs. 8. The\r\ntadpole has now become a small frog, and has left the water. The tail\r\nhas shrunk, but has not entirely disappeared: it remains throughout life\r\nhidden by the skin and the large thighs of the growing frog. This figure\r\nhas been kindly supplied by Messrs. Macmillan & Co., from Dr. Gadow’s\r\nvolume on the “Amphibia and Reptiles,” in the _Cambridge Natural\r\nHistory_.]\r\n\r\nI suppose that every one, or nearly every one, knows that these swarming\r\nlittle black tadpoles are the young of frogs and toads. As the season\r\ngoes on they grow to as much as an inch and a quarter (sometimes an inch\r\nand three-quarters) in length, and develop a number of golden\r\nmetallic-looking spots in the skin, which give them a brownish hue. Both\r\nthe fore and the hind limbs have now developed, but are hidden beneath\r\nthe skin, and all this time the tadpole is breathing, like a fish, by\r\nmeans of gills, concealed from view by a fold of skin. Very early it\r\nacquires a pair of lungs, and by the time the legs break through the\r\nskin (the hind legs do so first) the lungs are inflated, and help in\r\nrespiration. Now the head becomes modelled like that of a young frog,\r\nthe tail ceases to grow, its flat transparent border is absorbed and\r\neaten by “phagocytes,” and the legs become strong and large. Soon the\r\ngills atrophy, and the young creature crawls out of the water and spends\r\nmuch of its time in the damp grass and herbage near its native pond,\r\nrapidly assuming the shape of a frog. An interesting fact is that all\r\nthe time that it is a tadpole the little animal eats vegetable food or\r\nsoft animal food (even other tadpoles), has horny lips, and a very long\r\nintestine, coiled like a watch-spring. But as soon as it leaves the\r\nwater it becomes purely carnivorous, feeding on small insects and worms,\r\nand its intestine straightens out and becomes, relatively to the\r\nincreased size of the body, quite short.\r\n\r\nEven those who know frog-spawn when they see it and something of the\r\nhistory of the growth of the tadpole and its change into the young frog\r\nor toad (as the case may be) do not, as a rule, know about the laying of\r\nthe eggs. In the early spring (end of March) the full-grown frogs and\r\ntoads which have passed the winter buried in holes and cracks in the\r\nground in a state of torpor wake up and make their way to neighbouring\r\ngood-sized ponds. In these the eggs are deposited. The male frogs wait\r\nfor the females whom they seize from behind, placing their arms under\r\nhers and round the chest. They hold so firmly that nothing will persuade\r\nthem to let go. They often retain their hold for days or even weeks.\r\nSometimes by mistake they seize a fish and hold on securely to its\r\nhead—a fact which has led to the belief among country-folk that the\r\nfrog is an enemy of the carp, and tries to blind him by forcing his\r\nhands into the carp’s eyes. At this season a frog will clasp your finger\r\nor the handle of a stick so persistently that you can lift him out of\r\nthe water. A large pad of a black colour grows in the breeding-season on\r\nthe inside of the first finger of the frog’s hand, and is richly\r\nsupplied with nerves. It is this growth which is sensitive and when\r\ntouched sets up the cramp-like clasping action of the muscles of the\r\narms. The eggs are eventually squeezed from the female’s body, and are\r\nfertilised by the spermatic fluid of the male as they pass into the\r\nwater. They are, when “laid,” covered with only a thin transparent layer\r\nof albumen (or white of egg), and it is only after a few hours that this\r\nimbibes water and swells up into a ball-like mass around each little\r\nblack egg.\r\n\r\nYears ago I used to collect the spawning toads and frogs at Baden, near\r\nVienna, in order to observe (in the laboratory of the celebrated\r\nmicroscopist, Professor Stricker, the most gifted of his day) the\r\nearliest changes in the little black egg, the size of a rape-seed, which\r\nfollow upon fertilisation. Properly placed in a watch-glass full of\r\nwater under a low power of the microscope one little egg could be\r\nwatched for hours. If it had not been fertilised, nothing occurred. But\r\nif it had been, then there were strange movements of its surface and a\r\npuckering and sinking in along one definite line, coming and going, but\r\nat last becoming well marked like a deep furrow. Without actually\r\nsplitting, the little sphere was divided by the cleft into two halves.\r\nThen, at right angles to the first cleft, a second began to form, and so\r\non, until in the course of hours the sphere became divided on its\r\nsurface like a blackberry. The separate pieces thus marked out are the\r\nfirst “cells,” or units, of living protoplasm of the young tadpole. They\r\ncontinue to divide and to chemically convert the granular matter with\r\nwhich they are charged into living material whilst the mass slowly, in\r\nthe course of days (taking up water for its increase in actual size),\r\nbecomes elongated, and shows the rudiments of head, eyes, ears, spinal\r\ncord, and projecting tail. It is a fascinating task to watch this\r\ngradual development—and a difficult, but necessary, one (which has now\r\nbeen carried out in the minutest detail by patient students), to harden\r\nwith chemical solutions the growing embryos taken at successive stages,\r\nto embed them in wax or paraffin (as Stricker was the first to do), and\r\nto cut them into the finest slices, then to clarify these slices in\r\nbalsam-varnish, examine them with the microscope, and record and draw\r\nevery “cell,” every constituent unit, as they increase in number and\r\ncomplication of arrangement. That wonderfully difficult feat has now\r\nbeen carried out not only in the case of the frog and toad, but in the\r\ncase of hundreds of different kinds of animals of all sorts. Thus we\r\nknow the history of the growth from the egg in its minutest details in\r\nevery kind of animal—the “cell-lineage” of the tissues of the\r\nfull-grown animal traced back to the single original egg-cell.\r\n\r\nThe egg of animals is always originally a single “cell”—that is to say,\r\na minute corpuscle of slimy consistence, with a dense capsulated kernel\r\nor “nucleus” within it. The kernel or nucleus divides into two, and the\r\ncell itself divides; each of the daughter cells again divides, and so\r\nthe process continues, until thousands, and in larger animals millions,\r\nof cells are the result, as the mass of cells takes up nourishment and\r\nincreases in volume. When (as is the case in many animals, _e.g._\r\nstarfishes, worms, and mammals) there is only a little granular\r\nfood-material mixed in with the protoplasm of the egg-cell, that cell is\r\nof small size, only the one two-hundredth of an inch in diameter (see\r\nFig. 31). But in the frog there is much granular food-material, and the\r\negg-cell is distended to the size of a rape-seed. When there is still\r\nmore, as in the bird and many fishes, the egg-cell does not entirely\r\ndivide as it does in smaller eggs on commencing growth after\r\nfertilisation. The protoplasm collects into a disc incompletely\r\nseparated from the food-material, and it is the disc only which divides\r\ninto two, four, eight, and ever so many more cells. Some of the cells\r\nresulting from the division of the disc form the embryo’s body, and\r\nothers spread, as they multiply, all over the rest of the egg-ball from\r\nits edges so as to enclose the granular food-material in a sac, called\r\nthe yelk sac. In the frog, on the contrary, the protoplasm does not\r\nseparate as a disc: the whole egg-cell or ball divides to form the\r\nembryo-cells, and the food granules are included in the substance of the\r\ndividing cells. “Growth from the egg” is a long story; we must revert\r\nnow to the tadpoles and their parents.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that Dr. Edwards, the father of Henri and\r\ngrandfather of Alphonse Milne Edwards, directors of the Natural History\r\nMuseum of Paris, kept some tadpoles in a sort of cage sunk in the Seine,\r\nso that they could not come to the surface to breathe air nor escape on\r\nto the land, and that they grew to be very big tadpoles, much larger\r\nthan the size at which tadpoles usually change into frogs. I tried to\r\nrepeat this experiment when I was a boy—without success—and I have\r\nnever heard of any one having succeeded with it.[4] It is not cited or\r\ncredited at the present day. But some thirty years ago it was discovered\r\nthat something of this kind happens in the case of the Mexican\r\nsalamander. The English “newts” and the so-called salamanders are\r\ncreatures of lizard-like shape, which are closely related to frogs and\r\ntoads. They lay eggs in the water, and the young are tadpoles, with\r\nbeautiful large plume-like gills on each side of the head. The tadpole\r\nof the common English newt may either lose its gills and leave the water\r\nin the summer, if it was hatched early in the season, or may remain\r\nlonger in the gilled condition, and grow to more than two inches in\r\nlength, if it was hatched late. In certain lakes in Mexico there is a\r\ntadpole-like creature with gill-plumes, which grows to eight inches or\r\nmore in length, and becomes adult and breeds when in that condition. It\r\nis known as the “axolotl,” and was considered to be a distinct kind of\r\ngill-bearing adult tadpole-like animal similar to some few others which\r\nare known (Siren and Necturus). When, however, they were brought to\r\nEurope and kept in a cage with only a small provision of water, some of\r\nthese axolotls were found to leave the water, lose their gills, change\r\ntheir colour and shape in several respects, and become, in fact,\r\ntransformed into a terrestrial salamander, of a kind already known in\r\nNorth America. It was thus established that the axolotl of the Mexican\r\nlake is nothing more nor less than the tadpole of a species of\r\nsalamander or newt, which has “given up” the habit of leaving the water,\r\nand actually grows to full size, and lays its eggs without becoming\r\nconverted into a gill-less land-dwelling creature! The greatest interest\r\nwas excited forty years ago, when the discovery was made that, by\r\ngradually drying up the water in which the axolotl is kept, it can be\r\ninduced to resume its transformation, and become changed into a\r\nsalamander. Thus, the notion of converting the tadpoles of the common\r\nfrog into very big tadpoles by preventing them from leaving the water,\r\nseems not to have been an unreasonable one.\r\n\r\nThere are some very big kinds of tadpoles, which are the young of toads\r\nof other kinds than our British species. In England we have only two\r\nkinds of frogs—the common frog and the edible frog—and two kinds of\r\ntoads, the common toad and the natter-jack or crawling toad\r\n(distinguished by the pale line along the middle of his back). But on\r\nthe Continent of Europe there are others besides those which we have.\r\nThere is the beautiful little green tree-frog, and there are the\r\nfire-bellied toad, and the obstetric toad (the male of which carries the\r\neggs after they are laid, coiled in a string around his hind legs); and\r\nthen there is the little spur-heeled toad (_Pelobates fuscus_), which\r\nsmells like garlic, and is remarkable for having a broad, horny claw on\r\nhis heel. This toad is only about two inches and a half long (measured\r\nfrom snout to vent) when full grown, but its tadpole often exceeds four\r\ninches in length, and in rare cases attains the gigantic size of seven\r\ninches, so that it actually shrinks in size when it ceases to be a\r\ntadpole, and takes on the adult form. Many years ago I found some of\r\nthese huge tadpoles in a pond near Antwerp, and thought they must be a\r\nrealisation of Dr. Edwards’ experiment. They were enormous, and it was\r\nonly on bringing them home that I heard for the first time of the\r\nspur-heeled toad and its gigantic tadpoles (Fig. 44 C).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.—Outline drawings of three European tadpoles of\r\nthe actual size of nature. A, a full-sized tadpole of the Common Frog,\r\n_Rana temporaria_, one inch and three-tenths long.

C, a tadpole of the Garlic Toad,\r\n_Pelobates fuscus_, common in France, Belgium, and Germany, four inches\r\nand a half long. Specimens of as much as seven inches in length have\r\nbeen captured.]\r\n\r\nAmong frogs and toads from distant lands are some which bring forth\r\ntheir young alive, the female retaining the eggs in her body instead of\r\nlaying them in water. The black-and-yellow salamander of Europe (which,\r\nlike the common toad, has a highly poisonous secretion in the skin)\r\nretains its eggs inside its body until the tadpoles are well advanced in\r\ndevelopment, when they pass from her—about seventy in number—into the\r\nwater. In the closely allied black Alpine salamander only two, out of\r\nthirty or more eggs produced, develop. These two remain inside their\r\nmother until they have ceased to have gills and have become terrestrial\r\nair-breathing young salamanders like their mother. The Alpine salamander\r\nlives where there are no pools suitable for the tadpoles, and so they\r\nnever enter the water, but remain inside the mother’s body. Some\r\nexperiments have recently been made with these two species of salamander\r\nby varying the conditions as to moisture in which the young grow to\r\nmaturity, and results of considerable interest have been obtained. One\r\nof the most curious arrangements in regard to the young is seen in the\r\nSurinam toad, of which we had living specimens five or six years ago in\r\nthe London Zoological Gardens. In this toad the skin of the female’s\r\nback becomes very soft and plastic at the breeding-season. As she lays\r\nthe eggs the male takes them one by one and presses them into the soft\r\nskin of her back, into which they sink. The eggs are thus embedded\r\nseparately to the number of fifty or sixty, each in a little pit in the\r\nmother’s back. They slowly develop, each in its “pit,” the orifice of\r\nwhich is closed by a sort of lid. When the young have grown to the\r\ncondition of little toads, they push open the lids of the pits and swim\r\nout of their mother’s back. Specimens of these toads, with the eggs and\r\nyoung, in various stages, embedded in their mother’s back, are to be\r\nseen in most museums of natural history. Toads and frogs catch their\r\nprey by throwing forward the sticky tongue which is attached near the\r\nfront of the lower jaw, and so lick up their victim with startling\r\nabruptness. The Cape frog of South Africa (_Xenopus_), like the Surinam\r\ntoad (_Pipa_), has no tongue, and is also remarkable for possessing\r\nhard, pointed ends to its toes. It rarely, if ever, leaves the water.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[4] I am told by Mr. Boulenger, of the Natural History Museum, who is\r\nthe greatest authority on these animals, that the explanation of this is\r\nthat unawares Dr. Edwards made use of the young tadpoles of the\r\nobstetric toad (_Alytes_), which is very common near Paris, though it\r\ndoes not occur in England. These tadpoles regularly grow to be three\r\ninches and more in length (see Fig. 44 B). Dr. Edwards thought he had\r\nused the tadpoles of the common frog, but had, by accident, got hold of\r\nthose of _Alytes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nABOUT THE STARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young astronomer in _Two on a Tower_—that bitter-sweet story in\r\nwhich our great novelist Hardy tells of the weird fascination with which\r\nthe study of the stars appeals to a sensitive nature, exclaims: “The\r\nimaginary picture of the sky as the concavity of a dome whose base\r\nextends from horizon to horizon of our earth, is grand, simply grand,\r\nand I wish I had never got beyond looking at it in that way. But the\r\nactual sky is a horror.” “There is,” he continues, “a size at which\r\ndignity begins; further on there is a size at which grandeur begins;\r\nfurther on there is a size at which solemnity begins; further on a size\r\nat which awfulness begins; further on a size at which ghastliness\r\nbegins. That size faintly approaches the size of the stellar universe.”\r\n“If you are cheerful and wish to remain so,” he concludes, “leave the\r\nstudy of astronomy alone. Of all the sciences, it alone deserves the\r\ncharacter of the terrible. If, on the other hand, you are restless and\r\nanxious about the future, study astronomy at once—your troubles will be\r\nreduced amazingly. But your study will reduce them in a singular way, by\r\nreducing the importance of everything, so that the science is still\r\nterrible, even as a panacea.” The facts revealed by the study of\r\nastronomy which have this feature of ghastliness and terror relate to\r\nthe enormous distances in space at which the stars are placed, and to\r\ntheir enormous number.\r\n\r\nOne may sometimes see on the coast or in some marshland a “pile-driver”\r\nat work. At a quarter of a mile distance you can see the great weight\r\nhoisted up by cranks and chains above the “pile,” which stands upright\r\nbut not yet driven very far into the ground. You see the weight let go;\r\nit drops vertically on to the pile, and you watch it rising some two or\r\nthree feet on its return journey upwards, when suddenly you hear the\r\nsound of a sharp blow, and only after an effort realise that the sound\r\nwas made more than a second ago, and that the workmen have had time to\r\nraise the weight 3 ft. before the sound travelled to you. Sound travels\r\nless than a quarter of a mile in a second. Light also takes time to\r\ntravel, but it advances ever so much more quickly than sound, namely,\r\n186,000 miles (and a bit more) in a second. It is, therefore, easy to\r\ncalculate the number of miles traversed by light in a minute or in a\r\nyear. There are thirty million seconds in a year. The light of the sun\r\ntakes eight minutes to reach the earth, so, instead of stating the\r\nnumber of miles of this distance, we may say that the sun is eight\r\n“light-minutes” distant from the earth (about 89,000,000 miles). This is\r\nan enormous figure. The sun and his planets may be represented\r\nproportionately by a golden ball a foot in diameter, and a number of\r\nlittle spheres varying in size from that of a dried pea to a boy’s\r\nmarble, placed at distances from the golden ball varying from 50 ft. to\r\n200 ft. Such a model is shown in the Museum of Practical Geology in\r\nJermyn Street, London. Minute and scattered far apart as the planets of\r\nthe solar system appear when thus represented, yet the solar system is a\r\ncompact little group when we come to consider the distance from it of\r\nthe other suns—the “fixed stars,” which exist literally in millions\r\nbeyond it. The nearest of these stars (its name is Alpha Centauri) is no\r\nless than three light-years distant from us. A light-year is five and a\r\nhalf billion (that is, five and a half million million) miles. The\r\nnearest sun to us after our own sun is, therefore, about sixteen billion\r\nmiles away, and if its light were suddenly extinguished, we should not\r\nknow of its extinction for three years.\r\n\r\nHow many—we may well ask—how many of these fixed stars—suns like our\r\nown—are there? Roughly speaking, we can see with the naked eye,\r\nreckoning both the northern hemisphere and the southern together (for\r\nthe stars seen from the former are other than those seen from the\r\nlatter), about 8000. Not many after all, one is inclined to say. But\r\nstop a minute and hear what the telescope reveals. With the best\r\ntelescope about one hundred million can be seen, less and less brilliant\r\nand more difficult to see in proportion to their remoteness. And now we\r\ngo further even than that. For within the last thirty years the great\r\nscience of astronomy has been rejuvenated by the application of\r\nphotography to its task. The invention of the “dry” plate, a sensitive\r\nphotographic plate which does not spoil by prolonged exposure as the\r\n“wet” plate does, enables the astronomer to keep his telescope fixed by\r\nslow-moving clockwork on to a given region of the sky for four or five\r\nhours or more, and the very faint stars, invisible by the aid of the\r\nmost powerful telescope—stars the light from which is so feeble that it\r\ncould not affect the plate in a few seconds or minutes, have time by the\r\ncontinued action of their faint light to print themselves on the plate\r\nand sign, as it were, a definite record of their existence for man to\r\nsee and measure, though they are themselves for ever invisible to his\r\neye. It is not possible to say how many may be recorded in this way by\r\nphotography; it depends on length of exposure. But some thousands of\r\nmillions of stars can certainly be so recorded. These “unnumbered hosts”\r\nare of various degrees of brightness, and by methods which astronomers\r\nhave invented, but cannot be described here, it is actually known how\r\nthey differ in size from one another (many are far bigger than our sun),\r\nand with some approach to certainty, how far off they are. Stars of\r\nfour, five, ten, and more “light-years” away from us are well known.\r\nAstronomers actually estimate the decreasing abundance in space of stars\r\nas one passes from a sphere or spatial envelope of fifty light-years’\r\ndistance to one of 250 light-years. Finally, reasons have been given of\r\nlate for considering many of the “photographic” stars to be at a\r\ndistance of 32,000 light-years. I will not produce the awful figure in\r\nmiles, but the reader can refer back to the number of billion miles in a\r\nlight-year! And what is beyond that? No one has seen, nor can any one\r\nguess. We cannot imagine a limit to space; neither can we imagine\r\nunending space dotted with an infinity of suns!\r\n\r\nIt is a legitimate and, indeed, a necessary inference, from what we know\r\nof these millions of suns—intensely hot, light-giving spheres—that\r\nthey, too, like our own sun, are accompanied by much smaller bodies,\r\nplanets which circle round them, as our sun’s planets circle round him.\r\nThose planets have cooled down, as have those of the solar system, and\r\nso do not give out light. In any case, they are too small to be seen at\r\nso vast a distance. It is, on the whole, probable that the changes on\r\nsome—indeed, many—of these planets have led to the production of\r\nliving material similar to, but not necessarily identical with, that on\r\nthis earth. It is, on the whole, more likely than not that there are\r\nintelligent beings existing on the planets of thousands of suns\r\ninvisible to our eyes: suns revealed only by the print on a photographic\r\nplate of their light, which has taken thousands of years to travel from\r\nthe regions of unseen obscurity to us. To have arrived by sober\r\nobservation and reasoning at this conception is, indeed, a tremendous\r\nflight of human thought and ingenuity!\r\n\r\nIt is the courage, the audacity—one may almost call it the superhuman\r\ncalmness—of astronomers, in the face of this truly overwhelming\r\nimmensity—that not only redeems their study from the oppressive and\r\nterrifying character with which it at first assails the human spirit,\r\nbut gives to their proceedings and discoveries, so far as the ordinary\r\nman can follow them, an unequalled fascination. The daring, the\r\npatience, the accuracy, and the supreme intellectual gifts of the great\r\nastronomers rightly fill other men with pride in the fact that there are\r\nhuman minds capable of revealing things of such stupendous vastness and\r\nof indicating their order and relation to one another. It is a splendid\r\nfact, and one which must give hope and courage to all men, that the\r\nastronomer’s mind does not totter—it is equal to his task. Astronomers\r\nare, in fact, triumphant: they are very far indeed from suffering from\r\nthe depression which Mr. Hardy’s young star-gazer experienced.\r\n\r\nAmong the many conclusions of astronomers as to the movements of the\r\n“heavenly bodies” none is more strange and mysterious in its suggestion\r\nthan that recently arrived at to the effect that in all this vast array\r\nof millions of stars, the limits of which we can neither discover nor\r\nimagine, there are two huge streams moving in opposite directions, and\r\nin one or other all the stars are involved. Whence do they start? Where\r\nare they going? There is no answer. Another conclusion, which is arrived\r\nat quite simply by the examination with the spectroscope of the light\r\ncoming from the star named Vega by astronomers, is that our sun and its\r\nattendant planets are moving towards that star. It is true that it is\r\nmany billions of miles away from us, but we are rushing towards it\r\nsomewhat rapidly according to mundane notions—namely, at the rate of\r\nnineteen miles a second! That, I think, is a fact likely to make the\r\nsentimental young astronomer as miserable as any of the records of\r\nimmensity. In fact, the only comfort to be got in view of this fact is\r\nin the enormous distances which separate us from other stars, and the\r\nlength of time which must elapse before any serious consequence can\r\nensue from this alarming career. And there is further the probability\r\nthat the general result of attractions and repulsions in the vast\r\nroadway of space will, when the time comes, take us safely past Vega,\r\njust as a motor-car passes safely through the traffic and obstructing\r\n“refuges” and lamp-standards of the London streets as you recline in it,\r\nabandoned to the natural forces described as “chauffeurs.”\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope has done no less than photography to reanimate the\r\nstudy of astronomy. The fact is that, with these two helping means of\r\nobservation, it has become possible for the ordinary man to witness and\r\nappreciate some of the discoveries of astronomers, though the true and\r\naccurate handling of all that is revealed concerning the stars is\r\nessentially a matter of measurement, and therefore only to be dealt with\r\nstrictly by mathematicians. The desire to obtain ever more and more\r\naccurate measurement of the movement and the size of the heavenly bodies\r\nis the mainspring of all astronomical discovery, and, indeed, the\r\nattempt to gain more and more detailed measurement of the factors at\r\nwork is the motive—more or less immediate—of all accurate\r\ninvestigation of nature. Recently the astronomers of the Royal\r\nObservatory at Greenwich have photographed the new comet (the third of\r\n1907) in a way in which no comet has ever been photographed before. On\r\nmany consecutive nights for several weeks they were at work\r\nphotographing it on the dry plate, at intervals of two or three hours,\r\nand the pictures obtained (which I have seen at the rooms of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society) show the most wonderful changes of form of its\r\ntail, so that they look more like the record of the changes of some\r\nliving creature than those of a heavenly body. Already, in October 1909,\r\nHalley’s comet, which has been anxiously awaited, has been seen, though\r\nit is not expected to be bright and visible to all until May 1910.\r\nComets are among the exceptional delights of the astronomer—that is to\r\nsay, big comets, for two or three small comets visible only by a\r\ntelescope or by photography turn up every year. Some comets are expected\r\nvisitors, others make their appearance quite casually, some because they\r\napparently have no regular period, some because that period is as yet\r\nundiscovered. Edmund Halley was the first to discover the law of\r\nmovement of a comet and to predict the return in 1758 of that seen in\r\n1682. He did not live to witness the verification of his prediction.\r\nThis comet, now called Halley’s comet, was, he conjectured, the same\r\nwhich had appeared in 1531 and in 1607. His prediction of its return\r\nproved to be a year out (owing to perturbations caused by Neptune and\r\nUranus, two planets undiscovered in his day), but it appeared in 1759,\r\nand went round once again and reappeared in 1835, and now is eagerly\r\nexpected by astronomers to appear in full brilliancy in 1910. Its period\r\nis about seventy-five or seventy-six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nCOMETS\r\n\r\n\r\nA comet is so called from the hair-like stream of light or “tail,” which\r\nstretches to a greater or less length from its bright head or “nucleus.”\r\nA large comet, when seen to greatest advantage, may have a tail which\r\nstretches across one-third of the “vault of heaven,” and may be reckoned\r\nby astronomers at as much as one hundred and twenty million miles long.\r\nDonati’s comet—which some of my readers will remember, as I do, when it\r\nvisited us in 1858—was of this imposing size. Halley’s comet, on the\r\nother hand, when it was last “here,” namely, in 1835, showed a tail\r\nestimated by astronomers to be fifty million miles long. The tail was\r\nmore than twice as long when Halley’s comet appeared in 1456. There was\r\na big comet “on view” in 1811—the year celebrated for its wine—and in\r\nrecent times a fine comet appeared in 1861, and another (Coggia’s comet)\r\nin 1874.\r\n\r\nThe ancient records of comets are naturally full of exaggeration. Up to\r\nMilton’s time—two hundred and fifty years ago—they caused the greatest\r\nterror and excitement by their sudden appearance in the sky. This is due\r\nto the fact that mankind from the very earliest periods of which we have\r\nrecord has not merely gazed at the “starry host” by night in solemn\r\nwonder, but even in early prehistoric times studied and watched the\r\nstars so as to know much of their movements and regular comings and\r\ngoings. The earliest priests, the earliest “wise men,” were those who\r\nknew the stars and could fix the seasons by their place; the earliest\r\ntemples—Stonehenge, and others older still—were star-temples or\r\nobservatories, and their priests were astronomers. To such a pitch did\r\nreverence for star-knowledge attain that our ancestors confused the\r\nastral signs of changing season and cycle with the cause itself of\r\nchange, and attributed all kinds of mundane events and each man’s fate\r\nto “the influence of the stars.” Hence the sudden appearance of a\r\nflaming comet was held to be a portent, and was always supposed either\r\nto foretell or even to produce some very unpleasant event, such as a big\r\nwar or a pestilence, or the death of some one supposed to be of\r\nconsequence. The earliest Greek poetry enshrines the superstition, which\r\nis handed on by Virgil, and finally by Milton. In Pope’s translation of\r\nthe _Iliad_ we find the helmet of the terrible Achilles described as\r\nshining\r\n\r\n  “Like the red star, that from his flaming hair\r\n  Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war.”\r\n\r\nAnd Milton, in 1665, in his _Paradise Lost_, wrote—\r\n\r\n                        “On th’other side,\r\n  Incenst with indignation, Satan stood\r\n  Unterrifi’d; and like a comet burn’d,\r\n  That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge\r\n  In th’ Arctic sky, and from his horrid hair\r\n  Shakes pestilence and war.”\r\n\r\nIn this year of the celebration of the tercentenary of Milton’s birth,\r\nit is not a little curious to find that John Milton, himself a scholar\r\nof St. Paul’s School, wrote those lines when Edmund Halley, the future\r\nAstronomer Royal, had just entered the same great school, then standing\r\nin St. Paul’s Churchyard, as it did when I was “one of the fishes,” and\r\nused to see men hanging in the Old Bailey—I once saw five[5]—on\r\nMonday mornings as I passed on my way to the school. To a Pauline it is\r\nnot without significance that the return of Halley’s comet is awaited\r\nwithin a year of Milton’s tercentenary, and that the greatest astronomer\r\nand the greatest poet of their age were London boys and Paulines.\r\n\r\nAncient records tell of comets of gigantic size, of the shape of a\r\nsword, the head as big as the moon, and so on. There is no reason to\r\nsuppose that within historic times there have been any much bigger than\r\nthat of 1858. Milton, in the lines above quoted, was not referring to an\r\nimaginary comet, but to one which actually did appear when he was a boy\r\nof ten (1618), in the constellation called Ophiuchus. It was of enormous\r\nsize, the tail being recorded as longer even than that of 1858. It was\r\nheld responsible by educated and learned men of the day for disasters.\r\nEvelyn says in his diary, “The effects of that comet, 1618, still\r\nworking in the prodigious revolutions now beginning in Europe,\r\nespecially in Germany.” The comet of 1665 was, with equal assurance,\r\nregarded as the cause of the Great Plague of London. In that year was\r\npublished the first number of the _Philosophical Transactions_ of the\r\nRoyal Society of London, then recently founded “for the promotion of\r\nnatural knowledge.” It contains an account of a paper by a learned\r\nFrench gentleman, M. Auzout, in which an attempt is made to predict the\r\nmovements among the stars of the comet of 1664. Astronomers had long\r\nknown and been able to predict the movements of the planets and the\r\nswinging of the constellations, but, as the French author observes, “all\r\nthe world had been hitherto persuaded that the motions of comets were so\r\nirregular that they could not be reduced to any laws.” He also hoped, by\r\nexamining the movements of the comets of 1664 and 1665, to determine\r\n“the great question whether the earth moves or not.” At that time the\r\nearth was “suspected” to move round the sun, but no proof of that motion\r\nhad been given. M. Auzout did not succeed in his laudable attempt,\r\nsimply because Newton’s great discovery of the law of gravitation had\r\nnot then been made.\r\n\r\nEdmund Halley was the intimate friend and passionate admirer of Newton.\r\nHe paid out of his own pocket for the publication of Newton’s\r\n_Principia_ by the Royal Society in 1686, the society having expended\r\nall its available funds in printing a great work on _Fishes_ (which\r\nshows how at the first, as now, the society cared for the whole range of\r\nthe study of Nature). Halley was able to show that comets move regularly\r\nround the sun, in obedience to the same law of gravitation which\r\ncontrols the movements of the planets and of our earth itself; so that\r\nmany of them are regular members of the solar system. Halley especially\r\ncalculated out the form of the orbit of the comet of 1682 as an ellipse,\r\nand the time of its journey and recurrence, or “period,” as it is\r\ncalled, which he showed to be about seventy-five or seventy-six years.\r\nHe predicted its recurrence in 1758. Halley died in 1742, at the ripe\r\nage of eighty-six, having, amongst other good deeds, founded the Royal\r\nSociety Club, which still dines every Thursday in the session. His comet\r\nreappeared in 1759, a few months later than he had, owing to incomplete\r\ndetails used in his calculation, expected; but the accuracy of his\r\nscheme of its movement was demonstrated. It duly appeared again in 1835,\r\nand it is now awaited in the spring of 1910. Halley himself had\r\nidentified his comet with that of 1607 and of 1531, and lately, by the\r\naid of records from an ancient seat of astronomical observation—actually\r\nfrom China—it has been traced back to the month of May in the year 240\r\nB.C. It has caused consternation and terror times enough since then, of\r\nsome of which we have record. Finally, it has become the leading\r\ninstance of the triumph of scientific knowledge and accuracy over\r\nignorance and superstition. Halley’s comet caused great alarm in Rome in\r\nthe year 66 A.D. A thousand years later (1066) it was seen when William\r\nthe Conqueror was preparing to descend on the coast of England, and is\r\nactually represented in the Bayeux tapestry. A number of men are drawn\r\n(or rather “stitched”), with fingers pointed and eyes raised to a shape\r\nin the sky which resembles a star-fish with a large triangular-ribbed\r\npetticoat attached to it, ending in eight flames or tongues (Fig. 45).\r\nThe picture is labelled “Isti mirant stella.” There is now no doubt, as\r\naccurate calculations have demonstrated, that William the Conqueror’s\r\n“star” was Halley’s comet—a fact which must give its reappearance in\r\n1910 an additional interest in the eyes of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nThe shape given to the representations of stars in old pictures and\r\nengravings is a puzzle. Why do they represent a star by the shape of a\r\nstar-fish? No star ever looks like that, or produces a picture of that\r\nshape on the retina. The thing is purely conventional. The shape which\r\nwe call “star-shaped”—a term we apply to flowers and other things—is\r\nnot in the least like a real star as seen by an unprejudiced person.\r\nWhat one really sees is an ill-defined point of light. The pretended\r\nconventional star of ancient drawings perhaps arose from the simple\r\nartifice of picturing tongue-like flames around or upon any\r\nrepresentation of a fire or a source of light—“to show what it was\r\nmeant to be.” Then the notions of perfection and symmetry in regard to\r\nthe celestial bodies led to the “tongues” being arranged for the\r\npurposes of draughtsmanship as perfectly symmetrical-pointed rays of a\r\nsix- or eight-limbed geometrical design—and latterly it is possible\r\nthat the mystical figure known as the “pentacle” was utilised by\r\nastrologers and others as the emblem of a star. However they arose,\r\nneither the weird and astonishing representations of mediæval times nor\r\nthe geometrical decorative “stars” of later date seem to have any\r\nrelation to an attempt to represent a star as it really appears to the\r\nhuman eye and the interpreting brain behind it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.—Copied from a portion of the Bayeux Tapestry,\r\nshowing Harold’s men looking with superstitious wonder at the comet\r\nwhich appeared in the heavens immediately before the departure of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror’s expedition to England in A.D. 1066. That comet\r\nwas none other than Halley’s comet, and has now returned, and is visible\r\nfrom the earth for the twelfth time since the Conquest. (From a lecture\r\non Halley’s comet, delivered in 1908, by Professor H. H. Turner, F.R.S.,\r\nHalley’s successor in Oxford, published by the Clarendon Press.)]\r\n\r\nThe orbits of comets, says Professor Turner, of Oxford, in a delightful\r\nlecture delivered in Dublin in the summer of 1908, from which I have\r\nculled many interesting facts and presented them to my readers, “differ\r\nfrom those of the planets in being far more highly elliptical. Our own\r\npath round the sun is nearly a circle, so that our distance from him\r\nremains nearly the same all the year round; but the distance of a comet\r\nfrom the sun varies greatly from ‘perihelion,’ when it is near, and\r\nconsequently bright, to ‘aphelion,’ when he is so distant and faint that\r\nwe lose sight of him.” The sun is not at the centre of the ellipse\r\ndescribed by a comet’s path, but is quite near to one end of it, so that\r\ncomets approach the sun far more closely than do the planets, some\r\ntaking so close a turn round the sun that the heat from it to which they\r\nare exposed is 2000 times as great as that which the earth receives. If\r\nthe orbit of a comet is really elliptic, then there at last comes a\r\ntime, though it may be only after thousands of years, when the comet,\r\nhaving rounded the sun at close quarters, and journeyed off into space,\r\nhas his journey brought to a turning-point at the other end of the\r\nellipse, and begins to draw near again, advancing towards the sun. The\r\nlength of the orbit of Halley’s comet is about 3255 million miles, and\r\nthe breadth at its broadest is about 800 million miles, and he takes\r\nabout thirty-eight years to travel the full length (along the curve) and\r\nthirty-eight years to come back again! Other comets have other lengths\r\nand breadths of orbit, and take longer or shorter periods to go round.\r\nBut the conditions of attraction affecting a comet may be such that the\r\nreturn journey never occurs. They may be such that the comet goes on\r\nindefinitely travelling away from our sun, until he is caught by some\r\nother star, and his orbit changes its shape, with the new sun as\r\nattracting centre. These are the “wandering comets” as distinct from the\r\n“periodic comets,” which have been shown to conform to Halley’s scheme\r\nof their movement and recurrence.\r\n\r\nAnd now some one will ask, perhaps impatiently, “What, after all, is a\r\ncomet?” We have seen that many are continuously, and others casually,\r\nmembers of the solar system. What do they consist of? Spectrum-analysis\r\nshows that they consist chiefly of the chemical element carbon.[6]\r\nThough they have weight, and are attracted by the sun, yet they seem to\r\nbe for all their size and terrifying shape and glare incredibly light\r\nand airy things. Herschel declared that the tail of a big comet\r\nprobably consisted of but two or three pounds of solid matter—diffused,\r\nrarefied, and luminous. And the head or nucleus certainly does not weigh\r\nmany hundreds of tons. In the eighteenth century astronomers observed a\r\ncomet pass right in among the moons of the planet Jupiter. You might\r\nexpect the moons to be terribly knocked about by such an impact. They\r\nwere not; they were not deflected in the smallest appreciable degree\r\nfrom their position and regular movement! One is naturally inclined to\r\nlook upon the tail of a comet as something like the smoke of a railway\r\nengine trailing behind the advancing “head.” As a matter of fact, it\r\ndoes not always trail behind, but is always turned away from the sun, so\r\nthat when the comet is travelling away from the sun the tail is in\r\nfront! It is now held that the tail is caused by the radiant energy\r\n(light and heat) of the sun, blowing, as it were, the lighter particles\r\nfrom the incandescent head, and causing them to spread out in a long\r\ntrack of variable shape. The photographs of the third comet of the year\r\n1908 show that the tail can vary to an astonishing extent and with great\r\nrapidity—that is to say, in four or five hours. It is seen in those\r\nphotographs as a scimitar-like curved blade, then with a second head or\r\nnucleus behind the leading one, then actually bent like the letter Z,\r\nand then divided into seven distinct diverging “plumes,” and then it\r\nreturns to its former simple shape—all in the course of a few days.\r\nAstronomers have now shown that there is a close connection between\r\ncomets and the showers of “shooting stars” or meteors which frequently\r\nstrike the earth’s atmosphere. It is considered probable that comets\r\neventually break down into streams of meteors, and that their “life” (if\r\none may use that term) is, relatively to that of other heavenly bodies\r\n(which are all undergoing change and, in many cases, decay), not a very\r\nlong one. But there are no facts at present known which enable us to\r\ntell whether a given comet is young or old, and it would have been a\r\ndecided shock had it been found that Halley’s comet, which has so\r\nhappily spent every seventy-sixth year with us for so many centuries,\r\nhad “burst up,” or by “indisposition” had been unable to pay his usual\r\nvisit as expected in 1910.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[5] The pirates of the _Flowery Land_.\r\n\r\n[6] I am indebted to Mr. Rolston, of the Solar Physics Observatory,\r\nSouth Kensington, for some information on this matter.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, it appears that the spectra of these bodies indicate\r\ncarbon—in some form—as the principal constituent.\r\n\r\nAs to the particular form of carbon, there is still a considerable\r\ndoubt, so much that, in describing the spectrum of Morehouse’s comet,\r\nProfessor Frost says (_Astrophysical Journal_, xxix., p. 59, 1909):—“We\r\navoid the still unsettled question of the ‘carbon’ bands (of the\r\nso-called ‘Swan’ spectrum) which have been so often ascribed to a\r\nhydrocarbon, specifically acetylene, and we use for them the simple\r\ndesignation ‘carbon.’”\r\n\r\nIn addition to this “carbon” there is the cyanogen spectrum present in\r\nmost cases.\r\n\r\nSodium and iron have been detected in the spectra of some few comets,\r\n_e.g._ Wells (1882, ii.), whilst Holmes (1892) showed only continuous\r\nspectrum.\r\n\r\nAn interesting suggestion is made by Newall, namely, that the spectrum\r\nis not indicative of the _comet’s_ composition, but of that of the\r\nmedium through which the body passes. Thus the persistent identification\r\nof the cyanogen bands in cometary spectra is attributed, primarily, to\r\nthe “heating up” of cyanogen existing, free, in circum-solar space.\r\n\r\nTill 1907 most of the cometary spectrograms showed only the “carbon” and\r\ncyanogen radiations, but in Daniel’s comet of that year, and in\r\nMorehouse’s of 1909, other lines were detected for which origins have\r\nnot, as yet, been found.\r\n\r\nThus, some form of carbon + unknown + (occasionally) sodium and iron\r\nseems to sum up our present knowledge of cometary composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nABOUT CHOLERA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is this terrible disease which every few years travels from the\r\nbanks of the Indian Ganges, where it is always present, and makes its\r\nway to one or more of the great cities of Europe, killing its thousands\r\nwith horrifying rapidity? The word “cholera” is used by the great Greek\r\nphysician of antiquity, Hippocrates, and by his followers down to the\r\ndays of our own Sydenham, to describe a malady which occurs commonly in\r\nsummer, is often of severe character, but rarely fatal, and is\r\ncharacterised by the exudation from the walls of the intestine of\r\ncopious fluid, usually accompanied by vomiting and sometimes by\r\n“cramps.” This malady is now distinguished by physicians as “simple\r\ncholera,” or European cholera, the last name being misleading, since the\r\ndisease occurs all over the world. It is caused by a special microbe,\r\nwhich multiplies in the intestines and produces a poison. Other microbes\r\nproduce similar results. One which causes luminosity in foul salt water\r\nhas been found to produce cholera-like results when cultivated in a\r\nstate of purity and swallowed by man. Other poisons besides those\r\nproduced by microbes set up a sort of “cholera” in animals and man.\r\nDrugs of both mineral and vegetable origin have this effect, as every\r\none knows, and are used in small quantities to produce purging.\r\nMicrobes which are noted for other obvious effects which they produce by\r\nthe poisons they form in man’s intestines—such as the microbe of\r\ntyphoid fever—also produce cholera-like purging.\r\n\r\nBut the name “cholera,” or “the cholera,” is now applied without any\r\nfurther qualification to what would be more correctly described as\r\n“Indian cholera,” or “epidemic cholera.” It is a disease which first\r\nbecame known to Europeans in India in 1817, less than a hundred years\r\nago. It resembles “simple” cholera in its general features, but is\r\nusually much more violent in its attack, and often causes complete\r\ncollapse in two or three hours from its onset, and death in as many\r\nmore. The main point about it is, however, that it is a quickly\r\nspreading “epidemic” disease; it invades a whole population, and travels\r\nfrom place to place along definite routes. Although the outbreak of\r\ncholera in India in 1817 was the first to attract the attention of\r\nEuropeans, it was nothing new in India, and was recognised in distant\r\nages by Hindu writers. Its usual name on the delta of the Ganges is\r\n“medno-neidan.” Ninety per cent. of the population perished of cholera\r\nin some districts of India in 1817, and English troops were attacked by\r\nit with terrible results.\r\n\r\nCholera gradually made its way in subsequent years through Persia to\r\nRussia, and at last to Western Europe; but it was not until late in the\r\nyear 1831 that Indian cholera arrived for the first time in England, and\r\nin the following year it caused something like a panic. There have been\r\nat least three subsequent outbursts of Indian cholera (before that of\r\nthe year 1908) which have reached Europe, and two of these have reached\r\nEngland and caused profound alarm and anxiety. That in 1854 reached us\r\njust before the Crimean War, and caused such rapid and numerous deaths\r\nin London, especially in the West End (St. James’s, Westminster), that\r\nthe corpses were removed in carts as in the days of the plague. It was\r\nthen that the Broad Street pump became famous, and the carefully\r\ndemonstrated history of a cesspool leaking into the well of the pump, of\r\nthe existence of a cholera patient in the house to which the cesspool\r\nwas attached and of the infection with cholera of healthy people who\r\nsent all the way from Hampstead to fetch what they thought was the\r\nbeautifully pure, cool, and palatable water of Broad Street, St.\r\nJames’s, caused a most vivid and salutary impression on the public mind.\r\nThe “water-carriage” of the cholera infection was established as a fact,\r\nand the subsequent abolition of surface wells and pumps, as well as of\r\ncesspools, in London and other cities was the result. Indeed, the active\r\ndevelopment of sanitation and sanitary measures of all kinds in Great\r\nBritain may be traced to the panic caused by the cholera in 1854 and to\r\nthe well-founded conviction that it was in the power of the community,\r\nby the construction of sewers and the provision of untainted\r\nwater-supply, to protect itself against such disaster in the future.\r\n\r\nYears passed by, and still the actual germ of cholera was unknown. In\r\nIndia it was not even admitted that its diffusion was especially\r\nconnected with water-supply. The methods of observing with the\r\nmicroscope those minute swarming organisms which are called “bacteria”\r\nbecame immensely improved. They were isolated, cultivated in purity, and\r\nthe activity of a vast number of different kinds of different shapes,\r\nsizes, and modes of growth was ascertained. They were distinguished\r\naccording to their shape as bacilli, spirilla, micrococci, and so on,\r\nand separate kinds were characterised—one producing ordinary\r\nputrefaction, another the souring of milk, another the “cheesing” of the\r\nsame fluid, another the destruction of teeth and of bone, another the\r\nterrible anthrax of cattle or wool-sorters’ disease, another (a spiral\r\nthread in the blood this!) the recurrent fever of East Europe—each\r\nproducing its own special poison or other chemical substance.\r\n\r\nSo it went on till Koch, of Berlin, discovered the bacillus of tubercle\r\nand Hansen that of leprosy. Others had failed to find what Koch now\r\nfound as the result of a special mission on behalf of the German\r\nImperial Government to India (undertaken as nearly as I can recollect\r\nabout the year 1884)—namely, the living organism (Fig. 46) which by its\r\ngrowth in man’s intestine causes Indian cholera. Koch found a spiral\r\nthreadlike “bacterium” in cholera patients, which readily breaks up into\r\nlittle curved segments like a comma (each less than the one\r\nten-thousandth of an inch in length), and swarms by the million in the\r\nintestines of such patients. He showed that it can be cultivated in\r\ndilute gelatinised broth, and obtained in spoonfuls. It was, however,\r\nonly with great difficulty that he could produce cholera in animals by\r\nadministering this pure concentrated growth of cholera germs to them.\r\n\r\nThen a most courageous thing was done. A great and very acute\r\ninvestigator of cholera in Munich, Pettenkofer by name—who did not\r\nbelieve that Koch’s comma-bacillus was really the effective germ of\r\ncholera—himself swallowed a whole spoonful—many millions—of the\r\ncultivated cholera germ. His assistants did the same—and none of them\r\nsuffered any ill effect! Few, if any, of the investigators of this\r\nquestion gave up, as a consequence, their conviction that Koch’s\r\nbacillus was the real and active cause of cholera. They supposed that it\r\nmust be necessary for the human intestine to be in a favourable\r\ncondition—an unhealthy condition—for the Koch’s bacillus to multiply\r\nin it. It was by this time known that bacteria of all kinds are\r\nexceedingly sensitive in regard to the acidity or alkalinity, the\r\noxygenation or de-oxygenation of the fluids and organic substances in\r\nwhich they can, when exactly suited, multiply with tremendous rapidity.\r\nThus the tubercle bacillus cannot be cultivated on pure blood-serum, but\r\nif a trace of glycerine be added to the serum the tubercle bacillus\r\ngrows, divides, multiplies like yeast in a brewing-vat. A little later\r\nPettenkofer’s audacious experiment was repeated by Dr. Metchnikoff in\r\nParis. He swallowed a cultivated mass of the cholera germ on three\r\nsuccessive days, and had no injurious result. Others in his laboratory\r\ndid the same, with the result of only a slight intestinal disturbance.\r\nBut of a dozen who thus put the matter to the proof in the Institut\r\nPasteur, one individual acquired an attack of true Indian cholera,\r\naccompanied by all the most violent symptoms, which very nearly caused\r\nhis death. This experiment put an end to all discussion, and\r\ndemonstrated, once for all, that the comma-bacillus (or spirillum) of\r\nKoch is really capable of producing Indian cholera, and is the actual\r\nagent of this disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.—_a_, _b_, _c_, _d_. The cholera spirillum, or\r\ncomma-bacillus of Koch; _a_, spirillum stage of growth, with vibrating\r\nflagellum, by which it is driven along with screw-like movement; _b_,\r\nthe spirillum has lost its flagellum, and is motionless: it is marked\r\noff into separate segments; _c_, the segments have separated from one\r\nanother as comma-shaped pieces, hence the name “comma-bacillus” given to\r\nit by Koch; _d_, a number of comma-bacilli of cholera which have\r\ndeveloped tails of vibratile protoplasm (like a single cilium), and are\r\nswimming about, being driven by the lashing of these tails; _e_, a\r\ncubical packet of sarcina; _f_, a double row of the spherical units\r\n(cocci or micrococci), which form a sarcina-packet; _g_, similar cocci\r\nseparated.]\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which determine whether the cholera-bacillus, when it\r\ngets into the human intestine, will develop and cause an attack of\r\ncholera, or will simply be digested or will remain alive, but inactive,\r\nfor a time, have yet to be exactly determined. Obviously a knowledge of\r\nthem must be of immense importance. Certain experiments show that other\r\nminute parasitic organisms—especially those called _Sarcina_ (Fig. 46,\r\n_e_), which often, but by no means always, are abundant in the human\r\nintestine—favour the growth of the cholera-bacillus—in fact, prepare\r\nthe ground or soil, as we may call it, for that deadly organism. This\r\nhas been shown experimentally by sowing cholera-bacillus on plates of\r\nslightly acid gelatine, or jelly. It will not grow on this, but if at\r\ncertain points on the surface of the jelly the _Sarcina_ organism is\r\nplanted, then it is found that all around the points where the _Sarcina_\r\nis growing the cholera-bacillus also flourishes and multiplies. And it\r\nseems probable that, just as there are microbes which are adjuvant or\r\nhelpful to the cholera microbe, so there are others which are repressive\r\nor destructive of it. We know that this is the case with regard to some\r\nother microbes—namely, that a microbe which will flourish abundantly on\r\na prepared jelly if it is alone, is entirely repressed and arrested in\r\nits growth by the presence of one other ascertained kind. It is, in\r\nfact, thus that some of the commoner putrefactive kinds of microbes\r\noccurring in river water are repressive of the typhoid-bacillus, which,\r\nif it should get there, flourishes best in the purest water or in water\r\ncontaining no other microbe. There is some ground for thinking that in\r\ncertain districts there may be microbes present which make their way\r\ninto the human intestine, and then actually repress the\r\ncholera-bacillus, should it subsequently be taken in with food or water.\r\nIt would, of course, be of immense importance to discover such a\r\nmicrobe, if it exist, and the inquiry is at the present moment\r\nproceeding in Paris.\r\n\r\nA very striking and at first sight astonishing fact in regard to this\r\nsubject is that there are a very large number and variety of microbes\r\nhabitually present in the human digestive tract. There are so many\r\ndifferent kinds—differing altogether from one another in their chemical\r\naction—which are present in greater or less abundance in this tract\r\nfrom one end to the other, that no one is at present able to say even\r\napproximately how many there are, nor to give anything like a complete\r\naccount of their properties. The fact is that their isolation and study,\r\nand the definite determination of their properties, is not an easy job.\r\nMany workers are engaged on it, and it will be years before the matter\r\nis threshed out. One most curious result of these studies is that a\r\nperson may have the cholera-bacillus in his intestine—not growing with\r\nany activity, but still alive—and yet be perfectly well. He can,\r\ntherefore, carry the cholera-bacillus from one locality to another and\r\nspread the disease, and yet be entirely devoid of suspicion, free\r\nhimself from disease, and certified as healthy! The same is true of the\r\nbacillus of typhoid fever. Persons who have had typhoid fever have been\r\nshown to retain the typhoid-bacillus flourishing for as long as fourteen\r\nyears afterwards in their intestine, without any ill effects to\r\nthemselves, and to have been the constant source of infection and\r\ndisease to those living in the same house with them by spreading the\r\nbacillus. The classical case of this is that of a woman who carried on a\r\nbaker’s business at Strasburg. Infection by and protection from microbes\r\nis by no means so simple a thing as it is sometimes represented to be.\r\n\r\nNow that we are quite sure as to Koch’s comma-bacillus, or spirillum,\r\nbeing the definite poison-producing agent causing Indian cholera, it is\r\ncomparatively easy to understand its mode of dispersal and infection,\r\nand consequently how to avoid its attack. It is cultivated in the\r\nlaboratories devoted to the study of such matters—kept in confinement,\r\nso to speak, for ten years and more—and its properties and conditions\r\nof life are well known. For instance, it is destroyed by “dryness,”\r\nhence it cannot be carried in a living infective state as “dust” in the\r\nair. It is also destroyed by exposure to a heat a good deal below that\r\nof boiling water, so that water itself can be freed from it by boiling,\r\nand food dipped in boiling (or nearly boiling) water, or heated on a\r\nmetal tray beneath which a spirit or gas flame is burning, can be\r\nrendered safe just before it is swallowed, even when cholera is rife in\r\nthe neighbourhood. Ordinary lime is a great destroyer of the bacillus,\r\nand can be used on a large scale to abolish it in refuse.\r\n\r\nWhen the cholera is near one cannot be too scrupulously clean. The\r\nfingers must be carefully washed with antiseptic before a meal, and\r\neverything purified by heat only a few moments before being put into the\r\nmouth, since flies and careless handling may soil food or anything else\r\nexposed in a cool condition even for a few minutes. It is best when\r\ncholera is actually present in the house or town in which you live to\r\nswallow nothing which has been allowed to get cool; everything should be\r\nheated and eaten when hot. Mephistopheles, in Goethe’s _Faust_,\r\ncomplains of the swarming, pullulating life on the earth. He—the great\r\ndestroyer—says:\r\n\r\n  “How many have I sent to grass!\r\n  Yet young, fresh blood, do what I will\r\n  Keeps ever circulating still.\r\n  In water, in the earth, in air,\r\n  In wet, dry, cold—everywhere\r\n  Germs without number are unfurl’d,\r\n  And but for fire, and fire alone,\r\n  There would be nothing in the world\r\n  That I could truly call my own.”\r\n\r\nThe version is Sir Theodore Martin’s. Mephistopheles might be a\r\nbacteriologist explaining the difficulty of dealing with disease germs.\r\nIn any case, it is the Mephistophelian spirit of annihilation, and flame\r\nas its instrument, which man brings to his service in the contest with\r\ncholera germs.\r\n\r\nThe great carriers of cholera are human beings themselves travelling in\r\ncaravans, pilgrimages, shiploads. For the fact has now been established\r\nthat a man may harbour inside him the cholera-bacillus without its\r\nmultiplying largely or rendering him seriously ill. Once it is brought\r\nby such an individual into a favourable locality, it is spread by water\r\ncontaminated by him, and yet used for drink and domestic purposes; and\r\nalso it is spread by his touching things in which the bacillus can grow,\r\nsuch as cooked food, fruits, etc., swallowed subsequently by\r\nunsuspecting purchasers or employers. You have, in order to avoid\r\ncholera (and similar infections), not only to have very clean fingers\r\nyourself, but to see to it that your servants’ fingers are clean also,\r\nor else that anything they touch is afterwards heated for a few minutes\r\nto near boiling-point before you let it enter your mouth. A little\r\nhistory illustrative of the need of this precaution is on record. In\r\nEgypt during a recent outbreak of cholera there was a very wealthy lady\r\nwho lived alone in an isolated palace under the charge of a physician.\r\nShe had a delicate appetite; her food was most carefully prepared. She\r\ndrank and used only boiled sterilised water; no one was allowed to\r\napproach her except her servants, who never left the palace grounds, and\r\nwere in good health. She sickened of cholera and died. It was a puzzle\r\nas to how she had acquired the infection. Her physician at last\r\ndiscovered that she daily partook of cold chicken-broth, prepared\r\ncarefully by her cook. The cook, though practically well, was found to\r\nbe infected with the cholera-bacillus, which had probably lodged in his\r\nintestine some weeks previously at the commencement of the outbreak of\r\nthe disease in Egypt. Though living in him the cholera-bacilli had not\r\nfound a favourable field of growth. This man in handling the cold broth,\r\nthe cloth used to rub the spoon with which it was stirred, or the basin\r\nitself, had, it was found by making the actual experiment, been able to\r\ntransfer the minute bacillus to the cold broth, a most favourable and\r\nnourishing medium for its growth, and so his isolated carefully guarded\r\nemployer received an abundant crop of the bacilli and developed a fatal\r\nattack of cholera. Had the lady taken the broth hot, there would have\r\nbeen no living cholera-bacillus in it, and if she had thus guarded\r\nherself in regard to all food, by the use of heat and great cleanliness,\r\nshe would have escaped infection.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting development of knowledge and speculation with\r\nregard to the microbes which infest the human intestine and other\r\nregions of the human body is (as I mentioned above) connected with the\r\nfact that one kind or species of microbe has the power of favouring the\r\ngrowth of another, if present alongside of it, and that another kind has\r\nthe power of checking or antagonising its growth. Thus common\r\nputrefactive microbes of river water are hostile to the cholera-bacillus\r\nand to the typhoid-bacillus. Those disease-producing bacilli live\r\nlongest and best in very pure water! Thus, too, it is found that the\r\nmicrobe of sour milk—the lactic-bacillus—is antagonistic to the common\r\nputrefactive microbe of the intestinal contents—the well-known bacillus\r\ncoli. In virtue of the acid which it produces, the microbe of sour milk\r\narrests the excessive growth and activity of the putrefactive bacillus\r\ncoli. Hence the utility of sour milk in many cases of intestinal\r\ntrouble. We contain within us a microbian flora of such variety and\r\nabundance of kinds and so nicely balanced in their antagonisms and\r\nco-operations in a healthy man, that one cannot wonder at the timidity\r\nof the medical man who hesitates to interfere with their conflicts and\r\nestablished _modus vivendi_. Yet that seems to be the direction in which\r\naction will have to be taken. It seems likely that in different\r\nlocalities—towns, forests, highlands, lowlands, seaboards—there are\r\nprevalent different microbes which enter the bodies of human visitors\r\nand act as disturbers of the native microbian flora previously\r\nestablished in the stranger.\r\n\r\nThat there are great differences in the microbian flora (including\r\nherein minute moulds and fungi as well as bacteria) of different\r\nlocalities, is shown by the great experiment of cheese-making which\r\nmankind carries on. Each kind of cheese—Stilton, Cheshire, Dutch,\r\nRoquefort, Gruyère, Gorgonzola, etc.—is the result of the combined and\r\nsuccessive action on milk of a vast number of microbes; and it is the\r\nfact that the combination which produces any given kind of cheese is\r\nonly found and (unconsciously of the exact nature of what he is doing)\r\nbrought into activity by man at certain places. You cannot make Cheshire\r\ncheese in France nor Gruyère in Cheshire, and so on. It is\r\nsuggested—and the matter is being pursued by experiment and observation\r\nat the present time in France—that possibly amongst the other things\r\nwhich go to make up the qualities of the air which agrees or disagrees\r\nwith one in any given locality—are the local microbes. This must not be\r\nregarded as a conclusion which has been fully worked out—it is an\r\ningenious and promising suggestion made by Metchnikoff as the result of\r\nsome observations, and will be fully inquired into. The fact which I\r\nhave mentioned above (p. 242)—that the presence of the microbe\r\n_Sarcina_ favours the growth of the cholera-bacillus—indeed, enabling\r\nit to grow and flourish in conditions in which it was inert until the\r\n_Sarcina_ was “sown” alongside of it—renders it worth investigating\r\nthe question as to whether there are “local” germs or microbes which in\r\nthis or that region are abundant and get into man’s food and drink, and\r\nso into his intestine, and become established there, helping or\r\nantagonising the growth of other microbes already there or subsequently\r\nintroduced. Thus, to the various considerations in regard to the “air”\r\nof a locality, such as rarefaction, moisture, temperature, movement,\r\nozone, and the perfumes and exhalations of pine trees, rosemary, and\r\nsweet-smelling grasses, which seem to be those which are the most likely\r\nto affect the health of inhabitants and visitors, it is not improbable\r\nthat we must add the influence of an invisible local flora of microbes.\r\nThe inquiry is a long and laborious one, but it will be carried through.\r\nThe microbes, whether in air or water, or on the surfaces of things, can\r\nbe collected by washing them into warm liquid gelatine. Then the\r\ngelatine is poured out on a plate, and hardens as a thin sheet of jelly.\r\nThis is protected from all further contamination, and, after a few\r\nhours, each invisible microbe embedded immovably in the jelly makes\r\nitself apparent. It multiplies enormously whilst remaining stuck to one\r\nspot, and is no longer invisible, but presents itself to the eye as a\r\nlittle sphere, or disc, of characteristic shape, colour, and quality,\r\nconsisting of many hundred thousands of crowded microbes produced by the\r\ngrowth and division of the original invisible one. Some dozens or some\r\nhundreds of little growing “dots,” and of many various kinds, will thus\r\nreveal themselves in the jelly according to the number and kinds of\r\nutterly invisible parent microbes introduced by your “washings” into the\r\njelly. And so the investigator has the means of getting at each kind of\r\ninvisible microbe quite detached from the others, and of separating it\r\nfor further cultivation and experiment as to its chemical and\r\ndisease-producing qualities. These microbial gardens of jelly-plates\r\nare, indeed, a wonderful revelation and a fitting “horticultural”\r\naccompaniment to the dark and gloomy forests of rampant wild microbes in\r\nour insides, where all are struggling for the soil, one crushing out\r\nanother by its sheer exuberance, a third choked by the encircling\r\nluxuriance of a fourth, just as the trees, mosses, and climbers of a\r\ntropical jungle are budding, pushing, grasping, destroying one another\r\nin their irrepressible growth.\r\n\r\nPettenkofer, of Munich, when he found (as Metchnikoff did later) that\r\nthe cholera-bacillus could be swallowed in spoonfuls without producing\r\nany harm, came to the conclusion that, though it was a necessary agent\r\nof the disease “cholera,” yet that there was still an unknown additional\r\ndetermining “cause” of a local character which must be present in order\r\nto render the “cholera-bacillus” effective. Metchnikoff is now seeking\r\nthis “local” cause and parallel antagonistic causes, in the microbian\r\nflora of localities which locally effect an entry into the human body,\r\nand are, on the one hand, “favourable,” or on the other hand\r\n“antagonistic.” Take as a concrete example Versailles. When cholera has\r\nbeen rife in Paris, there has been no cholera at Versailles. There is\r\nsomething at or about Versailles which does not permit cholera to\r\nflourish in men who live there. The guess—the hypothesis—which is\r\nbeing investigated at this moment, is that there is possibly a microbe\r\npresent at Versailles which enters into the microbial jungle of the\r\nintestine of mankind there, and is inimical to, repressive of, the\r\ncholera-bacillus when it also arrives there. Similarly, the suggestion\r\nis entertained, and is being experimentally tested, that there is in\r\nParis a microbial inhabitant of the intestine which is favourable to the\r\nenergetic growth of the cholera-bacillus when it puts in an appearance,\r\nbut that this favouring (as yet undetermined) microbe does not exist at\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\nThese imaginings and guesses as to favouring and antagonising microbes\r\nmust not be confused with the definitely ascertained facts as to the\r\ncholera-bacillus. But they are quite sufficiently important and probable\r\nto justify their narration to a discreet and sympathetic public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nSEA-BREEZES, MOUNTAIN AIR, AND OZONE\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty years ago people were very fond of talking about “ozone,” and the\r\nword is popularly used nowadays to signify a mysterious attribute of the\r\nair of the sea-coast or moorland without its real significance being\r\ngenerally understood. When Sir Oliver Lodge the other day warned people\r\nagainst hurting their nasal passages by sniffing up an unduly strong\r\ndose of ozone produced by a special ozone-making apparatus, I am\r\ninclined to think that most people who read what he said wondered what\r\n“ozone” might be.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century it was noticed that the sparks from a\r\nfrictional electrical machine are accompanied by a peculiar pungent\r\nsmell in the air. Many years after that, namely in 1840, the great\r\nchemical experimenter, Schönbein, the friend and correspondent of\r\nFaraday and discoverer of gun-cotton, found that the smell in question\r\nis produced by a special gas, which is formed in the air when electric\r\ndischarges take place. He found that this gas was a powerful\r\noxydiser—would, in fact, oxydise iodide of potassium so as to set free\r\niodine—and thus its presence could be detected by means of paper slips\r\ncoated with a mixture of starch and iodide of potassium. When they were\r\nexposed in air which contained even minute traces of this strange gas\r\nthey became purple-blue, owing to the liberation of iodine and the\r\nformation of its well-known blue combination with the starch. Schönbein\r\nfound that in breezy, fresh places his test-papers turned blue, and\r\nconcluded from that (confirmed by other evidence) that this smelling\r\ngas, to which he gave the name ozone—which simply means “the smelling\r\nstuff”—is present in good, ordinary atmospheric air, as well as in\r\nartificially “electrified” air. It is destroyed when such air is heated\r\nabove the boiling-point of water, and seems to be, as it were, “taken\r\nout” of the air by all sorts of dead organic matter, so that it is not\r\npresent in the air of large cities. I remember that when I was a boy we\r\nused to test the air for ozone with Schönbein’s papers (I am aware that\r\ntheir colour change is not absolute proof of the presence of ozone, as\r\nother oxydising gases might, if present, act in the same way), and we\r\nused to find more ozone when a south-west wind was blowing than in a\r\nnorth-easter!\r\n\r\nSchönbein wrote sixty papers on ozone—but its real nature was made out\r\nby others who succeeded him, chiefly by Andrews, of Belfast, and Tait,\r\nof Edinburgh. It turns out that ozone is a condensed form of the\r\nelemental gas oxygen—squeezed, as it were, and literally “intensified,”\r\nso that three measures of oxygen gas become only two of ozone. It very\r\nreadily changes back again—two measures of ozone expanding to form\r\nthree of oxygen. It is produced by the action of an electric discharge\r\nupon oxygen gas driven over the discharge and in greatest quantity when\r\nthat kind of gently-buzzing electric spark which is called “the silent\r\ndischarge” is used. It can be produced in quantity by passing\r\natmospheric air, or better, pure dry oxygen gas through a glass tube in\r\nwhich such a silent discharge is made to take place. As much as\r\nseventeen parts in a hundred of the gas can be thus converted into\r\n“ozone,” and some twenty years ago two French chemists succeeded in\r\ngetting even a larger proportion, and by submitting it to a tremendous\r\npressure at a temperature of 100 degrees below the freezing-point of\r\nwater, they obtained pure ozone as a transparent liquid. It was of a\r\ndark indigo-blue colour, and somewhat dangerous and explosive when the\r\npressure under which it had formed was removed. Ordinary oxygen gas has\r\nsince then been also liquefied in the laboratory: it is of a paler blue\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nThe “smell” which old writers had noticed and Schönbein had named was\r\nthus actually obtained as a distinct blue liquid. It is this which,\r\nthough present only in minute quantities, gives special oxydising\r\nactivity to fresh air. When pure, or present even to the small extent of\r\n4 per cent. in air, ozone is a destructive agent, a sort of\r\nextra-quality oxygen of triple instead of double power. Indiarubber is\r\nrotted and destroyed by it in a few minutes—a sort of combustion or\r\nquick oxydation taking place—and it is, of course, dangerous to the\r\nsofter parts of the human body, such as the air passages and lungs and\r\nthe eyes—when present in more than a minimal proportion. I believe that\r\nno one has yet determined exactly how great a percentage of ozone can be\r\ntolerated by a human being in the air taken into the lungs. In ordinary\r\nfresh country or sea-coast air only one part by measure in 700,000 has\r\nbeen found to be ozone, that is, 1/7000 per cent. But it is quite likely\r\nthat much more is occasionally present, since it is very difficult to\r\narrange a satisfactory examination of the air of any locality so as to\r\ndetermine how much ozone it contains. It is said that at higher levels\r\nthe atmosphere contains more ozone than it does at lower levels.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that ozone should thus have attracted\r\ngeneral attention and interest as the distinctive and specially active\r\nagent present in the pure air of the sea-coast and the mountain-top.\r\nPeople not infrequently, on arriving at the seaside, sniff up the\r\nodours of decomposing seaweed (containing a little iodine), and think\r\nthey are smelling the “ozone.” It is doubtful whether enough ozone is\r\never present in the atmosphere under simple natural conditions to affect\r\neven a highly-sensitive nose. But it is easy to produce enough by\r\npassing air over a silent electrical discharge to fill a large room with\r\nits peculiar smell. Whether it really is of benefit to the human being\r\nwho inhales a properly limited percentage of it seems not to have been\r\nclearly decided by experiment, although both in London and the United\r\nStates of America there are enterprising medical men who are convinced\r\nof its value and are using it. It would certainly seem that if the\r\npeculiar benefit which is often derived from sea air or from mountain\r\nair is due to the presence of this extra oxygen in such air, then\r\nnothing can be simpler or more rational than to introduce the proper and\r\nuseful percentage of ozone into the air of specially-arranged chambers\r\nin London and other large towns, so that we can visit or even inhabit\r\nthem and breathe ozonised air at will without going on a journey for it.\r\n\r\nBut it is a remarkable fact that, as with various natural so-called\r\n“mineral waters,” so with various “airs” which people find\r\nbeneficial—no one has yet clearly and decisively shown, in the first\r\nplace, whether they exert any chemical effect of a special kind on the\r\npeople who seem to benefit by drinking the one or breathing the other;\r\nstill less has any one shown what is the particular chemical ingredient\r\nof the air or of the water of any given resort which exerts the\r\nbeneficial effect attributed to that air or that water.\r\n\r\nThe air in different localities differs most obviously and importantly\r\nin four particulars, namely, as to whether it is still or windy, whether\r\nit is cool or hot relatively to the local surface, whether it is heavy\r\nor rarefied, whether it is dry or saturated with moisture. It is also an\r\nimportant fact that the atmosphere consists of layers and currents\r\ndiffering in these qualities, and that the higher layers can be reached\r\nby ascending to high-lying lands. At the same time it seems that in a\r\nflat country the ascent of a comparatively low hill brings you into a\r\nlayer or “stratum” of air differing more from that of the plain or\r\nvalley than would be the case were you to ascend to the same height in a\r\nmountainous region. The seaside and the mountain may owe the beneficial\r\ncharacter of their air to some of the varying qualities noted above.\r\nChemical differences may or may not be important, and seem hardly to\r\nhave been as yet brought within the range of accurate knowledge. Ozone\r\nmay be more or less present, so may perfumes and volatile oils, such as\r\nare given off by pine trees, and there may be more or less minute\r\nquantities of carbonic acid and of sulphurous acid, and still minuter\r\nquantities of the newly-discovered gases—argon and helium—which, for\r\nall we know, may have some effect on the human body. There seems to be a\r\ngreat field open for accurate investigations in regard to the action\r\nupon human health of all these varying conditions of the air. In the\r\nmeantime, we proceed by guesswork, and are influenced by tradition and\r\nbeliefs which are based on a sort of experience, but are of a very vague\r\nand unsatisfactory description.\r\n\r\nThe case is much the same with regard to the natural waters of\r\ncelebrated resorts. So far as their chemical composition is known, they\r\ncan be manufactured and applied for drinking or bathing anywhere. But\r\nminute quantities of certain gases and other elements may be present in\r\nthese natural waters and have escaped until now the observation of the\r\nchemist, and it is possible, though not demonstrated, that these rare\r\nchemical constituents may have some action on those who drink or bathe\r\nin the water. Ever since the time of the Romans natural mineral waters\r\nhave been sought, and the springs which discharge them have been\r\nfrequented, not because their chemical composition was known, but\r\nbecause experience seemed to show that they produced a beneficial\r\nresult. It can hardly be doubted that the baths and springs frequented\r\nat the present day are not so much themselves the cause of the benefit\r\nto the cure-seekers as are the change of scene and diet, and the repose\r\nand regular life willingly accepted by those who travel so far to reach\r\nthese springs.\r\n\r\nWith regard to ozone, there remains something more to be said, namely,\r\nin regard to its application, in a far less diluted form than is\r\npossible when it is taken into the lungs, to the destruction of\r\nputrefying organic matter and putrefactive and disease-producing\r\nbacteria. It is now some five or six years since air containing a high\r\npercentage of ozone—produced by the action of the electric\r\ndischarge—was used for the purification of the water-supply of large\r\ntowns. It is a fact that river water into which such ozone containing\r\nair is pumped becomes pure in the highest degree, in consequence of the\r\ndestruction by the ozone’s oxydising action, both of the bacterial germs\r\nalways present in vast numbers in river water and of the organic matter\r\non which the bacteria depend. This application of ozone is in use in\r\nseveral large towns for the purification of drinking-water, for which\r\npurpose it has very great advantages. It has also been successfully used\r\nby Dr. Allen, the director of the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, for\r\nkeeping the water of the marine aquarium there in a state of purity and\r\nwell charged with oxygen gas. A similar use has been made of oxygen\r\ncontaining a considerable percentage of ozone by enterprising surgeons\r\nfor the cleansing of ulcer and abscess. It is clear that such a gas may\r\npresent mechanical advantages over any liquid application.\r\n\r\nOzone is not, apparently, in favour or fashion with the general body of\r\nmedical practitioners at the present day, but possibly further\r\nexamination and determination of its physiological properties may lead\r\nto its receiving more attention in medicine. Already the peroxide of\r\nhydrogen—which is more or less correctly described as “ozonised water,”\r\nand is used (under the name “Auricomous hair-wash”) to change dark hair\r\nby its oxydising action to a golden tint—is used by surgeons for\r\nwashing out purulent wounds and abscess. Those who use the gas itself\r\nonly go a step further. Some day we may see a more general use of ozone;\r\non the other hand, it remains to be seen by direct and accurate\r\nexperiment whether its properties are as valuable to man as we may hope\r\nthey will prove to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nOXYGEN GAS FOR ATHLETES AND OTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the preceding chapter on ozone was written I have learned that\r\nthis peculiar triple-condensed variety of oxygen (it is called by\r\nchemists “O_{3}” whereas ordinary oxygen is “O_{2}”) is now being most\r\nsuccessfully applied to the purification of the water-supply of several\r\nlarge cities. A notable case is that of the great winter resort, Nice.\r\nOzone gas is one of the most effective destroyers of organic impurity\r\nknown; it destroys both bacterial germs and the putrescible impurities\r\nof water completely, and is itself converted in the process into\r\nharmless health-giving oxygen, whilst the water is rendered absolutely\r\nfree of all germs. It is readily manufactured by treating oxygen with\r\nthe electric discharge, and is produced at a cost which renders its use\r\nin water-purification an economical and financially satisfactory method.\r\nThe use of ozone gas as a medicinal application to cavities in the\r\nliving body in which disease-producing bacteria are lodged is making\r\nprogress. It has to be administered with great care by a medical expert,\r\nand though there has been delay and opposition on account of the novelty\r\nof the treatment, there are signs that ozone will become established as\r\na valuable therapeutic agent. It is a singular fact that so little has\r\nbeen done of late by scientific observers either as to the presence of\r\nozone in the atmosphere or as to the action of ozone on the healthy\r\nanimal body when present in minute quantity in the air taken into the\r\nlungs. The general opinion appears to be that it is either altogether\r\nabsent from the atmosphere or present only in quantity so minute as to\r\nbe negligible from the point of view of the physiologist except in very\r\nhigh mountain regions, and there the exact quantity remains\r\nundetermined. The only experiments in the last ten years on the subject\r\nof its action on animals are some which led the inquirers to the\r\nconclusion that constant exposure (in a closed chamber) to an atmosphere\r\ncontaining 4 per cent. of ozone caused death after five or six days by\r\nan inflammation of the lungs. Clearly it is desirable that further\r\ninvestigation on this subject by competent authorities should be made,\r\nand the effect of smaller quantities of ozone in the air respired,\r\nwhether continuously or at intervals, should be ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe action of ordinary oxygen gas is a separate matter. The atmosphere\r\nwhich we breathe consists of one part by volume of this gas and of four\r\nparts of nitrogen gas. It is the oxygen which is necessary to us and to\r\nall animals, and the nitrogen is merely an inert diluting accompaniment\r\nof the essential oxygen gas. It is, of course, easy to increase or to\r\ndiminish the proportion of oxygen in the air breathed accordingly as one\r\nintroduces additional pure oxygen or, on the other hand, diluting\r\nnitrogen into a collapsible bag or sac from which one continuously draws\r\nbreath. Such a bag can be connected by a tube to a helmet or mask\r\nenveloping the head. The expired air is discharged by a specially\r\nprovided passage. It used to be thought that it was dangerous to breathe\r\npure undiluted oxygen, although the proportion of oxygen to nitrogen in\r\nthe air taken into the lungs might be increased to as much as a half\r\nwithout injury, and, indeed, with great benefit in some serious\r\nconditions of collapse. Dr. Leonard Hill, F.R.S., of the London Hospital\r\nMedical College, has, however, recently shown that oxygen gas, of 97 per\r\ncent. purity, may be breathed continuously for as much as two hours\r\nwithout any ill-effects or sense of inconvenience. Contrary to what has\r\nbeen stated, it is neither exciting nor unpleasant. He has made the\r\nexperiment on himself and on some of his assistants, and in doing so has\r\nmade use of such an apparatus as that above-mentioned—so as to ensure\r\nthe in-take of undiluted oxygen.\r\n\r\nDr. Hill and Mr. Martin Flack have further found that the exhaustion and\r\nlabouring of the heart which is brought on by such special exertion as\r\nthat involved in running a hundred yards race or a quarter-mile race, is\r\nalmost completely avoided if the runner “fills his lungs” with oxygen\r\ngas before starting. The runner takes the oxygen gas into the lungs for\r\nsome two or three minutes before starting to race; of course, the lungs\r\nare not thus actually “filled” with oxygen, but a much larger proportion\r\nof that gas is lodged in them than when ordinary air is breathed, and a\r\nfull supply is thus afforded to the blood. The “distress” caused by\r\nviolent athletic efforts appears to be entirely due to the using up of\r\nthe available oxygen by the unusual activity of the muscles. The heart\r\nitself suffers most, the breathing becomes laboured, and there is a\r\nsense of suffocation, due simply to the urgent demand by the blood,\r\nheart and muscles for more oxygen. If, therefore, we ensure that there\r\nis an extra supply of pure oxygen in the lungs before the unusual effort\r\nis made, we avert these distressing symptoms: the unusual quantity of\r\noxygen needed is ready for use. Dr. Hill himself and young men who have\r\ntried the plan of inspiration of oxygen before a foot-race, declare\r\nthat they cannot believe that they are really running hard, even when\r\nsurpassing their usual performance. They come in at the end of the\r\nquarter-mile, having beaten their record; and with no sense of having\r\nmade a special effort; they feel fresh and ready to start again after\r\nmore oxygen and a short rest. Moreover, the after-effect on the muscles\r\nis stated to be such that “stiffness” and what is called “grogginess”\r\n(due in ordinary circumstances to the retention of lactic acid in the\r\nmuscle) do not supervene.\r\n\r\nSwimming and diving, as one would expect, are greatly affected by the\r\npreliminary oxygen inhalation; the length of time during which\r\nsubmersion can be endured without discomfort is doubled, and the great\r\neffort of fast swimming rendered less rapidly exhausting. Cycling uphill\r\nat a rapid pace becomes, according to Dr. Hill’s own frequent\r\nexperience, possible after oxygen inhalation when in ordinary conditions\r\nit was impossible. Hockey players and boxers he has found notably\r\nbenefited by oxygen given both in the intervals of and after the\r\nexercise. It is, of course, to be expected that a wider practical\r\napplication should be made of this simple method of increasing our power\r\nof sustaining muscular effort, and of enduring submersion. Dr. Hill\r\nsuggests that the divers of the Mediterranean, who, without any\r\napparatus, plunge into the shallow sea and remain below long enough to\r\nfind, cut, and bring to the surface the valuable sponges of commerce,\r\nmight use the method of preliminary inhalation of pure oxygen gas. He\r\nhas also tried the method with a young racehorse, but owing to the fact\r\nthat the course run was only a mile, and the animal perfectly fit and\r\nstrong, he tells me that no advantage was found to result from the\r\ninhalation. With an older cart-horse somewhat tired by a day’s work—he\r\nobtained the most satisfactory results, the animal becoming obviously\r\nrecuperated and working without distress.\r\n\r\nThe question has been raised as to whether the administration of oxygen\r\ngas to a man or to a horse when about to run a race should be considered\r\nas “doping.” It may perhaps be objected to by sportsmen, as involving\r\nthe provision of special apparatus which all competitors would not be\r\nequally able to secure. But it is not “doping,” since that applies to\r\nthe use of a drug, which, whilst exciting to violent effort, produces an\r\ninjurious after-effect. Oxygen is not in this category; to take an extra\r\nquantity of oxygen into the lungs before starting on a race is no more\r\nunnatural or risky than to take an extra drink of water into the stomach\r\nor to swallow meat extract and such special preparations before or\r\nduring a race. It would be interesting to see whether a runner in the\r\nMarathon race would (as Dr. Hill would expect) be greatly assisted if\r\nhis trainer carried with him a supply of pure oxygen, and from time to\r\ntime refreshed him with it. Football players might also be given oxygen\r\nat half-time; an oxygenated team would, one surmises, beat its\r\nuninspired competitors. A Fife team is reported to have done so. On the\r\nroads favoured by cyclists one may expect hereafter to find at the\r\nbottom of a long ascent hawkers of “breaths of oxygen” provided with\r\ngas-bags and calling out “Buy the lady a breff, sir!” It is, perhaps,\r\nworth noting that the relief afforded by oxygen-breathing is no less\r\ndefinite when the gas is taken immediately after a race or sustained\r\neffort than when used as a preliminary. The excess of choke-gas or\r\ncarbonic acid formed during great muscular effort is not the principal\r\ncause of the distress experienced. That gas is thrown off by increased\r\nexpiration. It is the using up of the oxygen and the insufficiency of\r\nthe supply in the atmospheric air inspired that causes, under these\r\ncircumstances, giddiness, exhaustion, and often collapse.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in breathing and the prostration experienced by many\r\npeople in mountain-climbing is largely due, not merely to the muscular\r\neffort of climbing, but to the fact that the rarefied atmosphere at\r\nheights of 8000 ft. to 15,000 ft. and more gives into the lungs in every\r\ninspiration but a fraction of the oxygen which is inspired at low\r\nlevels, and moreover, owing to the low pressure, much less is held in\r\nthe blood. Even when conveyed by mule, cog-rail, or balloon to these\r\nheights—and, therefore, without muscular exertion, sensitive people\r\nsuffer severely from temporary “oxygen-starvation.” They as well as the\r\nlaborious mountaineer could be saved from all such inconvenience by the\r\nuse of a skilfully-constructed “traveller’s flask” of oxygen gas.\r\n\r\nThe observations and experiments as to the possible use of pure oxygen\r\nby athletes suggest that we might all benefit by occasional if not\r\nfrequent use of such an atmosphere. Indeed, there are some\r\nindividuals—amongst others a well-known and distinguished actor—who\r\nbefore making some special effort, or even when feeling tired and\r\nunequal to their daily work, inhale under medical supervision a certain\r\nquantity of oxygen gas. It would certainly seem that since country air,\r\nsea air, and mountain air are useful and refreshing, an artificial\r\nsupply of extra oxygen might be inhaled in London, either in one’s own\r\nhouse or in establishments provided for the purpose, with definite\r\nbenefit to health, especially if the inhalation were combined with\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nThe experiments made by Dr. Hill have come about in connection with work\r\nundertaken for the purpose of improving the diving and life-saving\r\napparatus named after its inventor, Fleuss. This invention consists\r\nessentially in a water-tight helmet and jacket connected with a\r\ncylinder of compressed oxygen gas which is carried by the diver. The\r\nadvantage of such an arrangement is that the diver is free from pumping\r\napparatus and can go where an ordinary diver could not. Mr. Fleuss was\r\nable, by diving with this apparatus, to prevent an immense loss of\r\nproperty by arresting the flooding of the Severn tunnel which was\r\nimminent during its construction. A difficulty in regard to the Fleuss\r\napparatus has been that oxygen gas is a poison, causing inflammation of\r\nthe lungs and convulsions when under a pressure of from two to three\r\natmospheres—that is to say, at from 30 ft. to 60 ft. depth in water.\r\nThe pressure exercised by the air of the atmosphere at sea-level is\r\nequal to that exercised by a column of water 30 ft. high, and hence at\r\n30 ft. depth in the sea the oxygen gas would be under the pressure both\r\nof the atmosphere itself and of water to the same amount—which is\r\nexpressed by saying that it is under two atmospheres’ pressure, or twice\r\nthe atmosphere’s pressure. The pressure of the atmosphere is, in plain\r\nfigures, 15 lb. on every square inch of surface. Of course, the oxygen\r\nis compressed far beyond this point in the cylinders in which it is\r\ncarried. In using it, it is allowed to escape by opening a valve leading\r\ninto an elastic sac, and is then and there subject to the pressure\r\ndepending on the depth of water to which the diver has descended. It is\r\nfound to be dangerous for a diver with this apparatus to descend to a\r\ndepth of more than 30 ft. having pure oxygen in his apparatus, because\r\nthe oxygen is then compressed under a pressure of two atmospheres.\r\nAccordingly, Dr. Haldane, of Oxford, has proposed that the oxygen should\r\nbe diluted with atmospheric air, so as to give a mixture of equal\r\nvolumes of oxygen and nitrogen. With this mixture the diver can safely\r\ndescend to a depth of 60 ft. The apparatus is provided with a partition\r\ncontaining caustic soda, which absorbs the carbonic gas thrown out of\r\nthe lungs in expiration. With such an apparatus a diver can safely\r\nremain under water at a depth of 60 ft., and walk about and explore for\r\nas long as two hours. A most important application of this\r\nself-contained diving apparatus is found in its use in the exploration\r\nof mines, where smoke or gaseous products resulting from an explosion\r\nrender it impossible for rescue parties to penetrate without its use. It\r\nhas been the means of saving many lives in such circumstances. A form of\r\nthis apparatus is made in which the oxygen is supplied, not by a\r\ncylinder of compressed gas, but by granules of a chemical compound\r\ncalled pneumatogen, a peroxide of sodium and potassium, which when\r\nbreathed into absorbs carbonic acid from the air expired by the lungs,\r\nand gives off pure oxygen. Submarine ships are now being provided with a\r\ndress or outfit of this description for each member of the crew, so that\r\nin the case of the entrance of water into the submarine, every man can\r\nput on his “oxygen helmet,” and one by one, when the ship is full of\r\nwater, they can pass out by the conning tower and float to the surface.\r\nThe perfected diving dress, with self-contained diluted oxygen supply\r\nand other improvements, has been constructed by Siebe, Gorman, and Co.,\r\nand was exhibited by Dr. Leonard Hill at a soiree of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nSPARROWS, TROUT, AND SELECTIVE BREEDING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe talk about the urgent need for the destruction of sparrows reminds\r\nme that the word “sparrow” is applied commonly in this country to at\r\nleast two very different but common birds. No doubt farmers and\r\ngardeners know well enough the house-sparrow (_Passer domesticus_ or\r\n_Fringilla domestica_ of Linnæus), which is the one they consider\r\ninjurious. But some boys and some newly-fledged proprietors of country\r\nplaces may inadvertently confuse the house-sparrow with a very different\r\nbird, though only a little smaller and of a general brown colouring,\r\nalso called “sparrow,” namely, the hedge-sparrow (_Accentor modularis_).\r\n\r\nThe hedge-sparrow is a true denizen of the country. It does not live on\r\ngrain, but on insects and grubs, and is useful on that account to\r\nagriculturists. Its eggs are pure blue. A spotted egg of a cuckoo laid\r\namongst them readily catches the eye, so that cuckoos’ eggs are often\r\nfound in hedge-sparrows’ nests. It seems that it is all a mistake on the\r\npart of the cuckoo hen when this occurs. The strain of cuckoos properly\r\nattached to hedge-sparrows lay a beautiful blue egg differing only in\r\nits somewhat larger size from those of the hedge-sparrow itself, and\r\nhence difficult to detect. These blue cuckoo-eggs—proper to cuckoos\r\nwhich make use of the hedge-sparrow as foster-mother—escape detection\r\nboth by boys and the foster-parents, and successfully hatch out and\r\npropagate the race of blue-egged cuckoos with a memory and a sense of\r\nsmell which bring them back if they are hen-birds to the little\r\nhedge-sparrow’s nest when they are grown up and have an egg to dispose\r\nof. The spotted grey or brownish eggs are, if not discovered by boys,\r\nejected (there is reason to believe) by the hedge-sparrows themselves.\r\nThey were deposited by mistake by some pippet-loving or warbler-seeking\r\nstrain of cuckoo in a hurry, or are throw-backs to a common ancestral\r\ncolouring of the egg due, perhaps, to the male parent not being of the\r\ntrue blue strain. A very fine series of “clutches” and nests of\r\nhedge-sparrow, robin, shrike, reed-warbler, pippet, yellow-hammer, and\r\nother birds with the accompanying cuckoo’s egg may be seen in the\r\nNatural History Museum, and they show how closely the parasitic egg\r\noften resembles that of the foster-parent, though striking failures also\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nThe hedge-sparrow is placed in that group of small birds which includes\r\nthe robin, the thrushes, and the warblers; it is not a finch. On the\r\nother hand, the house-sparrow is a finch, allied to the chaffinch, the\r\ngoldfinch, and the brambling. It has, like all the finches, a very\r\npowerful broad-based beak, and is more than a match for bigger birds\r\nthan itself. It is really a parasite or “commensal” (messmate) of man,\r\nliving and flourishing entirely by helping itself to the grain and the\r\nyoung buds of shrubs grown by man, and in towns to the waste fragments\r\nof his food and the grain left in horse-dung. Whether it does any good\r\nin the early part of the year by eating grubs seems to be doubtful, but\r\nthe conclusion is justified that it does more harm than good, especially\r\nas it drives away other small birds which are exclusively insectivorous.\r\nIt has gone with European man to all temperate climates. There are\r\nSpanish, African, Italian and Indian species, closely related to the\r\ncommon house-sparrow, which I should like to see put out side by side\r\nwith it and some of its varieties for the public edification in the\r\nNatural History Museum. These are the true “sparrows,” and should be\r\ncompared side by side with the hedge-sparrow, and the differences\r\npointed out.\r\n\r\nThere is another true sparrow in England, called the “tree-sparrow,”\r\nwhich is not nearly so common as the house-sparrow. They are, however,\r\nso closely allied to one another that hybrids have been produced between\r\nthe two. On the other hand, the hedge-sparrow is a great deal too remote\r\nfrom the finches to interbreed with the house-sparrow or any other of\r\nthe finch group.\r\n\r\nThere ought to be a careful report on the probable effects, in every\r\ndirection, of a great destruction of house-sparrows before any very\r\ndrastic measures are taken in that direction. The employers of\r\ngamekeepers should remember that by destroying owls, hawks, and weasels\r\nthey may not only enable small injurious birds to flourish in excess,\r\nbut that they may encourage disease and weakness in the game-birds which\r\nthey so eagerly desire to multiply, since the natural extermination of\r\nweakly birds by birds and animals of prey is put an end to when the\r\nlatter are abolished. In all such matters more knowledge is needed, and\r\nreasonable people will not take irretrievable action until they have\r\ntaken the trouble to obtain thorough knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that though the house-sparrow does not naturally\r\nsing, yet hand-reared house-sparrows have been made, by association with\r\nbull-finches, to acquire the song of that bird—a truly astonishing\r\ninstance of hidden or latent capacity.\r\n\r\nA lover of trout-fishing has been writing lately upon the question as to\r\nwhether the trout in much-fished rivers and lakes do or do not exhibit\r\nincreased “wariness,” or even “intelligent caution” in avoiding the\r\nflies so cunningly thrown before or above them by the skilful angler. It\r\nis argued that there cannot really be any increased indisposition of\r\ntrout to take the fly based on experience, because on an estimate of the\r\nnumber of trout in a river like the Test, and of the limited number of\r\nanglers, every fisherman would have to hook and lose some thousands of\r\nfish every year for the experience to be general among trout that the\r\nhorrid artificial flies “hide a still more horrid hook.” It is, of\r\ncourse, held that the trout cannot communicate their experiences to one\r\nanother by any form of conversation (though leadership and imitative\r\nhabit might have some effect), and it is also not suggested that a trout\r\nwhich had acquired an overpowering aversion to the angler’s fly as a\r\nresult of being hooked and breaking free, could transmit that aversion\r\nto its offspring by the mere fact of reproduction. Hence it is\r\nmaintained that there is no such increasing “wariness” in English and\r\nScotch trout. It is a curious thing that in discussing this matter the\r\nfundamental principle should have been overlooked by which Darwin and\r\nWallace have long ago explained to the satisfaction of naturalists, the\r\naversions and cautious proceedings of all kinds of animals, from the\r\nsmallest insects up to birds, beasts, and fishes. The principle of\r\nnatural selection and survival of the fittest accounts for the increased\r\ncaution of trout in well-fished rivers in the simplest way. Assume (as\r\nis perfectly reasonable) that some trout are more shy than others “by\r\nnature,” that is to say, are born so, that some are born with a slightly\r\nmore rapid response to the sight of food than others—as one sees often\r\nenough with a lot of the young of any animal—then the increased shyness\r\nor pretended “intelligence” of the trout after many years’ fishing\r\nfollows as a necessity. The rash fish are caught and destroyed, the shy\r\nfish remain in the river, and—here is the important point, a\r\nwell-ascertained fundamental law of heredity—propagate their like. They\r\nproduce shy fish. Every year this selection goes on till you get a race\r\nof fish in the well-fished river which are so shy that they cease to\r\nrise at all! This unpleasant result is avoided by the proprietors of\r\ntrout streams to a certain extent by introducing a race of trout which\r\nhas not in consequence of over-fishing developed an innate shyness of\r\ncharacter (such as the Loch Leven and some others) to mix and breed with\r\nthe timid over-fished race.\r\n\r\nIt is in the same way that the human population of country villages,\r\nmost sad to see, is every year rendered less intelligent than it was a\r\nhundred years ago. All the enterprising, intelligent young men and\r\nmaidens are “fished” away, drawn by baits and hooks to the great towns;\r\nonly the dull and relatively incapable are left in the village to marry\r\nand produce a new generation. The village population necessarily becomes\r\nmade up of a dull stock—incapable, as appears from official reports, of\r\nbeing educated beyond a very low stage. In some districts 70 per cent.\r\nof the children are thus unintelligent, though not unhealthy or\r\nimbecile. It is possible that the want of home-training and example in\r\nvery early childhood is to some extent a cause of the dullness of\r\nvillage children. And so it goes on, generation after generation, as\r\nfacilities for leaving the village increase and inducements to stay or\r\nreturn decrease. The 30 per cent. of the new generation who have any\r\n“wits” leave the village, never to return. And no one re-stocks the\r\nvillage. That must be taken in hand soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nTHE FEEBLE-MINDED\r\n\r\n\r\nA considerable proportion of the young which are produced as a new\r\ngeneration of either plants or animals are not merely unlike their\r\nparents in some small particulars of colour, proportion, activity, and\r\nso on, but are, as compared with the normal or usual standard of the\r\nspecies, “defective”; that is to say, they are wanting in some organ or\r\npart, as though maimed, or by some cause restricted or reduced in regard\r\nto that part. This occurs in human beings, and in domesticated animals\r\nmore obviously than in wild animals and plants, for two reasons:\r\nfirstly, because in wild conditions the defective young die off very\r\nearly in the struggle for existence and so escape human observation;\r\nwhereas man protects his own “defective” young, and often, also, those\r\nof domesticated animals, so that they are allowed to “grow up” more or\r\nless; secondly, such defective structure appearing at birth, and\r\ntherefore called “congenital,” is carried on by heredity, more or less\r\ncompletely, should the defective animal or plant be allowed to breed.\r\nSuch breeding of defective individuals is prevented in wild nature by\r\ntheir early destruction; their defects cause their early death by\r\nunfitting them for the competition and struggle which are in natural\r\nconditions rigidly severe. Only a few survive among the many thousands\r\nof each species born into conditions of limited food and\r\nspace—conditions which are not sufficient to support more than a very\r\nsmall number so as to enable them to reach the adult or breeding stage\r\nof life. But man, on the contrary, protects his own young, and often\r\nthose of his domesticated animals and plants, from this destructive\r\ncompetition, and thus allows those which are to a certain extent\r\ndefective to breed.\r\n\r\nThe official returns of the Registrar-General record every year a\r\nproportion of deaths of infants which are entered as due to “congenital\r\ndefects.” These defects are of many and various kinds. A frequent\r\n“congenital defect” is one which does not necessarily cause death,\r\nnamely, the imperfection of the wonderfully elaborate organ of sight,\r\nrendering it useless. Children often are born blind, and so are a\r\ncertain proportion of each species of animal normally provided with\r\neyes—dogs, horses, cattle, birds, fish. Even insects, lobsters, and\r\ncrabs are in quite considerable and definite number born blind. The\r\ninborn or congenital defects of the eyes which result in blindness are\r\nof several kinds. The whole of the eyeball or eye-structure may be\r\natrophied, that is to say, dwindled and incomplete, or one essential\r\npart only may be defective, and the rest quite well-formed; or, again,\r\nthe nerves connecting the eye with the brain or the several parts of the\r\nbrain concerned in the function of sight may, one or more of them, be\r\ndefective. Wild animals born in this condition must perish, except when\r\nthey happen to be born in caverns or in the deep sea. Then they are no\r\nworse off than animals with “good” eyes. But the animals with good eyes,\r\nor even with only somewhat defective eyes, will follow up the gleams of\r\nlight which in moving about they have the fortune to encounter, and so\r\nwill escape from the cavern or dark depths of the sea, leaving behind in\r\nthe dark only those with defective eyes. These will breed together, and\r\nperpetuate their defective eyes in a more and more marked degree in\r\nsuccessive generations. Always those which can see, or see only a\r\nlittle, will leave the dark place, and so at last there will be a race\r\nof animals established in such places with defective eyes (as in the\r\nocean, at a depth of two thousand fathoms, and in the great caves of\r\nEurope, and notably in the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky, U.S.A.), and often\r\nthe eyes will altogether disappear. This, however, is a digression.\r\n\r\nThe cause of congenital defect in eyes is not obvious. The failure of\r\nthe germinal substance of the reproductive egg or particle detached from\r\nparents with sound eyes, to unfold itself—to develop—into a creature\r\nwith sound eyes like those of its parents, is apparently due, in some\r\ninstances, to one cause, and in other instances to other causes, of none\r\nof which can it be said that we have a satisfactory and comprehensive\r\nknowledge. The same want of full knowledge exists in regard to the\r\ncausation of other congenital defects. These are as numerous and varied\r\nas the parts of the body which may be from birth onwards, in one\r\ninstance or another, distorted, devoid of some essential inner\r\nstructure, swollen to great size, or shrunken, or even absent\r\naltogether. Such defects are sometimes caused by mechanical pressure or\r\nnipping in early stages of growth before birth, but there are many which\r\ncannot be accounted for in that way. The wonder really is not that the\r\ninconceivably complex structure of higher animals should sometimes fail,\r\nin this or that part, to develop in due course from the simple-looking\r\ngerm, destitute of visible structure, but that it should, on the\r\ncontrary, so regularly and completely come off successfully in millions\r\nof instances every day. We can imagine or suggest disturbing agencies\r\nwhich may be the causes of failure, but it is very difficult to\r\ndemonstrate with certainty the causes which have been at work in each\r\nand every case.\r\n\r\nOne result of failure of the germ to “grow up” into the perfect likeness\r\nof its parents is that it may “throw back,” as the breeders say, and\r\nresemble in this or that quality a remote, even an extremely remote,\r\nancestor. It is suggested by some inquirers that the congenital or\r\ninborn defect, frequent in human beings, which is called\r\n“feeble-mindedness” is a reversion or throw-back to the condition of the\r\nbrain in the animal ancestors of man. That is possible, and, in view of\r\nsome cases, seems probable. But it must be noted that we do not know\r\nwhat are the causes which favour throwing-back, or “atavism,” as it is\r\ncalled, in regard to all sorts of structures, and that the mechanical\r\nconditions connected with the growth of the cavity of the skull in which\r\nthe brain itself grows are so very elaborate that it is obvious that a\r\nvery slight disturbance of one element or another might arrest or turn\r\naside the growth of that vastly complex organ, which has become so much\r\nlarger and more delicate in man than in the animals from which he has,\r\nat no remote period in the history of life on the earth, taken his\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nMankind have always within the period of written records (a mere trifle\r\nin the lapse of time since man became man) regarded mental defect and\r\naberration as due to fantastic causes. To this day we use the word\r\n“lunatic” for one of the two typical forms of mental aberration: we\r\nimply that the moon is concerned in its production. The other form of\r\nbrain-failure has appropriated the term “idiot,” which, it is surprising\r\nto find, was less than two centuries ago applied in common speech to any\r\nperson who was characterised by independence of judgment. The term\r\n“softy” is a common and really more suitable term for this class, whilst\r\n“cracked” is the word applied to a lunatic. The notion that mental\r\naberration is due to “possession” by evil spirits, which can be expelled\r\nand the patient accordingly cured, was prevalent a century ago, and the\r\nbelief is common at the present day (though quite erroneous) that people\r\n“go mad” in virtue of some immaterial and unaccountable influence, and\r\nmay therefore “go sane” again. The lunacy laws and the laws relating to\r\nthe care of the feeble-minded in this country are admitted to be tainted\r\nwith ignorance and misconception, and both are in process of correction\r\nby the Government of the day.\r\n\r\nThe approved professional terms used in distinguishing the varieties of\r\n“the mind diseased” are not accepted with much favour by the public, and\r\nit is unnecessary to introduce them here. The important fact is that\r\npersons of diseased mind may be separated into two groups—(_a_) the\r\nidiots or softies, and (_b_) the lunatics or cracked people. The idiotic\r\ngroup are those with a defective amount or quality of brain substance\r\n(whether the skull itself is small or abnormally distended by “water on\r\nthe brain”), and are more or less incapable of being educated. They are\r\noften subject to epileptic fits, and are usually weakly in build, though\r\nthey sometimes have great muscular strength. The “feeble-minded,” of\r\nwhom so much has lately been written, owing to the recent report of a\r\nGovernment Commission, belong to this group. They are distinguished from\r\nthe more marked section of idiots in that they are not absolutely devoid\r\nof some intelligence, and are capable, under proper supervision, of some\r\ndegree of self-control. Some of them even can take part in industrial\r\noperations, though they require constant direction when so employed, and\r\nare never, even in the least serious cases, susceptible of mental\r\ndevelopment beyond a strangely and abruptly limited degree. Contrasted\r\nwith the idiots are the lunatics; they often are gifted with the highest\r\nreceptivity, and frequently are men or women of the highest education\r\nand intellect, normal in every feature of body and mind except that\r\ntheir mental machinery works in a defective, “mad” way as to one or more\r\nsubjects—often only as to one subject or class of subjects. They\r\nexhibit in different individuals a vast variety of illusions and\r\npropensities which may be merely unreasonable or may be dangerous to\r\nthemselves and to others.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the idiotic and feeble-minded are devoid of, or defective\r\nin, general mental receptivity, although in regard to a few things they\r\nmay have retentive but unintelligent memory. Even the less afflicted\r\namong them are incapable of “thinking” at all, because their defective\r\nmemory or receptivity gives them nothing to think about. On the other\r\nhand, the lunatic exhibits the ordinary receptivity of a healthy human\r\nbeing, but thinks wrongly or absurdly upon one or a few lines, though\r\nnormally and soundly upon every other.\r\n\r\nThe State in civilised countries has long since made provision for the\r\nproper medical care and restraint of lunatics and of the extreme cases\r\nof the other class, the idiots. But by an oversight in this country,\r\nwhich the gravedigger in _Hamlet_ would consider very natural, the less\r\nextreme cases of idiocy—the so-called feeble-minded—have been left\r\nwithout State guardianship. It is a fact that these cases occur both in\r\nthe wealthiest and the poorest class of the community, though they are\r\nput away under medical care by well-to-do families, and are left by the\r\nvery poor to wander about and get into terrible mischief. Hence there\r\nhas grown up a belief that feeble-minded offspring are more frequently\r\nproduced by mentally sound parents who are very poor than by those who\r\nare rich or well-to-do, though there are not facts or figures which\r\nestablish that conclusion. It has further been maintained that this\r\nsupposed large proportional rate of production of feeble-minded among\r\nthe poorest, ill-fed, ill-housed, and vicious dregs of the community is\r\ndue to the action of defective nutrition, alcoholism, and lack of fresh\r\nair and healthy occupation upon the parents, and that a deterioration of\r\nthe reproductive material, a twist, as it were, of the inner substance\r\nof the stock or breed in the direction of feeble-mindedness, has been\r\nthus established.\r\n\r\nIn reply to this somewhat hasty but at first sight plausible conclusion,\r\nwe maintain (1) that the definite defect called feeble-mindedness is as\r\ncommon in well-nourished, well-to-do families as in the poorest; (2)\r\nthat it is not proved that lack of food and good air can act upon the\r\ngerms contained in a parental animal, so as to alter it in such a way\r\nthat the brain of offspring begotten by that parent will not develop in\r\nnormal structure and proportion; and, moreover, that “it has not been\r\nshown” (that is the important clause of the statement) that defective\r\nfood and air can so alter the germs in a parent as to cause other\r\ndeformation or structural defect in the young which grow from those\r\ngerms. It is, on the other hand, true that such defect of food and air\r\nmay cause the death of the parent, or may directly cause the death of\r\nthe young, if the young are subjected to such defective conditions of\r\nlife. It is necessary to point out, in reply to those who hold the\r\nstarvation theory, of feeble-mindedness that it is capable of being\r\nhanded on by hereditary transmission once it has appeared, and that in\r\nthe most wretched groups of the population, both in cities and in\r\ncountry villages, the feeble-minded are not taken in charge by any\r\nauthority, but leave their parents and shift for themselves, and, owing\r\nto their weakness, accompanied by unrestrained animal desires, they\r\nbecome, in an irregular way and at a very early age, themselves the\r\nparents of feeble-minded children. Thus feeble-mindedness is increased\r\nin the poorest class, but not in that of the rich. The facts ascertained\r\nare too horrible and painful for citation here. The recent Commission\r\nhas made it clear that it is absolutely necessary for the State to\r\ninterfere and prevent this terrible increase of helpless imbeciles.\r\n\r\nThere are eighty-four schools in London for the education of children\r\nwho are not included under the extreme terms idiots or imbeciles, but\r\nare “feeble-minded and defective.” They are attended by 6000 children,\r\nof whom about two-thirds learn some useful manual work, whilst the rest\r\nare hopeless, and require permanent custodial care—which at present is\r\nnot to be had by those whose parents cannot pay for it—but will, there\r\nis every reason to hope, soon be provided for them by the State. In its\r\nabsence they constitute a real and ghastly danger to the community,\r\nsince some of them are certain to propagate their kind, and not only\r\nwill thus add to the existing large body of imbeciles, but perpetuate\r\nthe taint of feeble-mindedness in the race.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting question as to whether there is a definite gap—a\r\ndifference of kind between these poor, defective children and the\r\nmarkedly stupid boys and girls of some village schools. I am inclined to\r\nbelieve that there is. The one group does not pass by a gradual series\r\ninto the other. It has been stated that in some remote country districts\r\nof England only one-third of the school children can be taught more than\r\nthe merest elements of writing, reading, and arithmetic; the majority\r\nare immovably dull, only the minority are as bright as ordinary London\r\nchildren. But even the dull village children get so far as to master the\r\nelements of learning, and probably their brains are not structurally\r\ndefective, but only inactive for the time being. They may hereafter\r\nbecome village Hampdens. It certainly does seem to be the fact that the\r\nvillages are continually deprived of the more intelligent members of\r\ntheir population by the attractions of the big towns, and that only the\r\nduller portion stay to breed in the village like the blind animals in a\r\ncave. But dullness is not identical with feeble-mindedness.\r\n\r\nIt is maintained that even in towns the multiplication of the\r\nhard-working, cautious, and capable section of the community is at a\r\nstandstill. Its members seek comfort, intellectual exercise, and\r\nself-culture; they refuse to deprive themselves of these things, which\r\ncost money, and to spend that money on bringing up large families. On\r\nthe other hand, the far more numerous “working-class” has no such\r\nambition as a rule, and no anxiety as to what is to become of its\r\noffspring, however numerous. The more children the larger are the\r\nearnings of the family, and all in turn shift for themselves at an early\r\nage. The rates pay for such education as they require, and their parents\r\nhave no desire to push them up the social ladder; but food, lodging, and\r\nclothes cost money. The working-man who desires to read, see things for\r\nhimself, and be more than an animated cog on a wheel, cannot afford to\r\nhave children and transmit to them that modicum of intelligence above\r\nthe average which distinguishes him from his fellows, and demands for\r\nits cultivation the money with which he might keep a large family.\r\nConsequently the population is more and more largely replenished by the\r\nunenterprising poor and the unenterprising rich; the group which is\r\nenterprising and capable, and directs the work and thought of the\r\ncivilised world, is, by the very qualities which make the increase of\r\nits strain desirable, debarred from contributing its fair proportion to\r\nthe increase of the population. Is it possible for the community, by any\r\nsystem or by legislation, to overcome or evade this unfortunate\r\ntendency?\r\n\r\nThe neglect by both the local and central government to provide any\r\nsupervision of feeble-minded children has had a special result of a\r\nstrange and unhappy description. Let me hasten to say that now that we\r\nhave secured by recent legislation the vitally important medical\r\ninspection of children in connection with Board schools, and the\r\nregistration and official inspection of feeble-minded children which\r\nwill surely be made compulsory before another year has passed, the\r\ndanger of which I am about to speak will very shortly no longer exist.\r\nIt is this. Feeble-minded children (whose condition falls short of that\r\nof actual idiocy) are almost impossible to manage as members of an\r\nordinary family or household. Their condition is often not properly\r\nrecognised; their parents or guardians find them to be obstinate,\r\nunteachable, and dirty. Often, when the family is poor, they are, under\r\nthese circumstances, “boarded out” for a very small payment, or even\r\ntaken charge of, out of charity. None of the persons concerned in these\r\ntransactions know that they are dealing with a hopelessly unteachable\r\nchild, born with this defective brain. They find scolding has no effect\r\nin guiding the child, mild chastisement fails, and the poor ignorant\r\nfoster-parent (sometimes even the child’s own mother) becomes\r\nexasperated and determined to subdue what seems to be mere obstinacy and\r\nindifference. The awful demon of cruelty is let loose. What seems at\r\nfirst a virtuous determination to control and regulate the child’s\r\nbehaviour for its own good leads to the infliction upon it of blows of\r\nsavage violence, then to the less dangerous but revolting attempt to\r\nenforce obedience by the pain caused by a burn, and to starvation as a\r\nfinal instrument of discipline. A very large number of the cases of\r\ncruelty to children and adolescents which from time to time are brought\r\ninto the law courts have their origin in the fact that the victim was\r\n“feeble-minded,” and that the guardian found guilty of cruelty did not\r\n(any more than do the judge and jury) understand or, indeed, know\r\nanything at all about such a condition. Often the feeble-mindedness\r\nitself has been attributed to the cruel treatment of the child, whereas\r\nthe latter really was set going by the former. To a large extent the\r\ncommunity is to blame for allowing “feeble-minded” children to be\r\nboarded out except in proper medical institutions, guaranteed and\r\ninspected by State authority. It is the same story as that which was\r\nonce common enough in regard to “lunatics,” but has now been put an end\r\nto by the law. The boarding-out of children, whether healthy or\r\nweak-minded, should in all cases be illegal, except under proper\r\nofficial sanction and guarantee. It is not only for the sake of the\r\nchildren that this provision is necessary. It is certain that foolish\r\npeople have been led, in the absence of all restraint and interference\r\nby public authority, to undertake without evil intention the care of\r\ndiscarded children, and have been led on by the hopeless dullness and\r\nobstinacy of a child with defective brain into cruel treatment of it;\r\nand when in some cases the child has died as the natural consequence of\r\nits congenital feebleness, the miserable guardians have been found\r\nguilty of causing its death. Though little excuse can be made for such\r\nmiscreants, it is greatly to be desired that the law should step in at\r\nan earlier period, and both ensure proper care for the feeble-minded\r\nchild and remove from unqualified guardians the chance of developing\r\nfrom a state of mere ignorance into one of criminal responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe Government Commission on the Treatment of the Feeble-Minded, which\r\nhas recently reported, has adopted the view which I have explained in\r\nthis article as to the origin of feeble-mindedness. A large amount of\r\nevidence was taken by the Commission from medical experts and others. A\r\ncertain number of the witnesses maintained the opinion that\r\nfeeble-mindedness arises from the action of deficiency of food, of\r\novercrowding, and possibly of drunkenness upon individuals of healthy\r\nstrain, whose offspring, as a consequence, exhibit feeble-mindedness.\r\nSome naturalists, who have committed themselves to a pious belief in\r\nwhat is vaguely called “the transmission of acquired characters,” think\r\nthemselves called upon to support this opinion, in consequence of a\r\nnotion that their belief would be rendered more reasonable than it is at\r\npresent were such an origin of feeble-mindedness demonstrated. Apart\r\nfrom the fact that it is not demonstrated, it is difficult to see how,\r\nsupposing it were, such a causation could be considered as a\r\ntransmission of an acquired character. The ill-fed, drunken parent of a\r\nfeeble-minded child (when discovered and examined) is not found to have\r\n“acquired” a condition of the brain agreeing with that of his or her\r\nfeeble-minded offspring, though sometimes such parent is found to have\r\nbeen himself or herself born with a defective brain. No theory of\r\norganic memory, of engrams, inscripts, or transfer of molecular\r\nvibrations can enable us to present a plausible mechanical scheme of the\r\nway in which the acquired general condition (restricting ourselves to\r\nwhat is new and acquired) of an ill-fed parent can be definitely and\r\nspecifically re-embodied in his or her offspring, as the peculiar\r\nstructural condition of brain which is called “feeble-mindedness.” It\r\nhas not been shown, so far as I am aware, that privation in regard to\r\nthe food of a parental organism gives rise to new congenital qualities\r\nin the reproductive germs which that organism throws off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nDEATH-RATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief index or measure of the health of any locality is what is\r\ncalled “the death-rate” of that locality. Although there are several\r\nother important evidences as to the healthiness or unhealthiness of any\r\ngiven area, the “death-rate” is the chief and most obvious indication of\r\nthe advantageous or disadvantageous action of the conditions of any\r\ngiven city or other chosen area upon human life. Its records are more\r\neasily kept with an approach to accuracy than are records of cases of\r\nsickness not terminating in death. The cause of death has to be\r\ncertified in civilised communities by a medical man; the total number of\r\ndeaths in a year is given by the number of burial certificates. The\r\ndeath-rate is stated at so many per thousand of the population per\r\nannum. Thus, in a city of 5 million inhabitants,—that is to say, 5\r\nthousand thousands—a record of eighty thousand deaths in the year gives\r\n16 deaths for every thousand persons living. That is called “an annual\r\ndeath-rate of 16.” The record for any single month may be stated (as it\r\nis stated at intervals in the newspapers) “as at the rate of so many in\r\nthe thousand per annum,” by multiplying the actual monthly number per\r\nthousand by 12. Thus, in the case of the city just cited, if the\r\ndeath-rate were the same in every month of the year—namely, 16—it\r\nwould mean that 6500 persons died regularly every month. But we should\r\nprobably find that in some month or other as few as 5417 persons died.\r\nThat would be reported “as at the rate of” 13 per thousand per annum;\r\nsince, if every month gave only 5417 deaths, we should get 65,000 deaths\r\na year, which works out at 13 in the thousand in a population of 5\r\nmillions. In other months it might run as high as 19 or 20 (representing\r\nover 8000 deaths a month), although, taking all the months together, the\r\ndeaths are at the rate of 16 in the thousand for the year.\r\n\r\nThe bald statement of the death-rate, of course, admits of much analysis\r\nwhere proper records are kept. Thus the death-rate from different\r\ndiseases and groups of diseases can be stated, and the death-rate in\r\neach group at different ages and for the two sexes can be given where\r\nproper records are kept. In this country the records of population in\r\nvarious areas and for the whole country, and of the deaths from various\r\ncauses, and at different ages, are collected and tabulated by the\r\nRegistrar-General and his officials. The annual reports issued by him\r\nshow what an amazing progress has been made in increasing the security\r\nof life in our great cities within the last fifty years. Thus, in\r\nLondon, the death-rate was, fifty years ago, 24 in the thousand. In 1906\r\nit was only 15.1 in the thousand—it has gradually fallen, year by year,\r\nso that now it is less than two-thirds of what it was half a century\r\nago. In Manchester and Liverpool it was about 26 twenty years ago, and\r\nhas fallen to 19 in Manchester and to a little over 20 in Liverpool. In\r\nthe same period the improvement has been (omitting fractions) from 19 to\r\n14 in Bristol; from 20 to 16 in Birmingham; from 20 to 14 in Leicester.\r\nThis great diminution in the death-rate has been coincident with the\r\nexpenditure of public funds on the improvement of the water supply and\r\nthe sewage arrangements of those cities, as well as with the\r\nenforcement of regulations to prevent overcrowding, and with the\r\ndemolition of the most insanitary houses. Rules as to the removal of\r\nfilth from the neighbourhood of dwelling-houses have been obeyed, and\r\nsick persons suffering from infectious diseases have been removed from\r\ndwelling-houses and conveyed to special hospitals. There is no doubt\r\nthat the diminished death-rate is due to the action thus taken, and more\r\nwill be done in the future to the same end. The proper provision of pure\r\nmilk (at a reasonable price) for the food of the youngest children, of\r\nregular meals for older children, and the protection of adults from the\r\ntoo frequent inducement to indulge in the use of distilled spirits, will\r\nbe taken in hand by the municipalities, and lead to a further diminution\r\nin the death-rate.\r\n\r\nWe may, indeed, soon have to ask whether, in a population which has\r\nbecome so much less subject to diminution by death than was formerly the\r\ncase, there is not too great an increase by birth—too great, that is to\r\nsay, for the existing means of employment and food-production. A most\r\nserious, indeed, an alarming fact, has recently come to light in the\r\nstudy of this question, namely, that the increase of the population is\r\ndue (as pointed out on p. 279) to the proportionately larger number of\r\nbirths amongst the poorer, and even destitute, sections of the community\r\nwho have not the means of training and rearing their children\r\nsatisfactorily, and are themselves likely to transmit incapacity of one\r\nkind and another to their offspring; whilst those who have valuable\r\nhereditary qualities and are prosperous have—it is clearly\r\nestablished—relatively few children—and, in fact, do not increase the\r\npopulation. Whether this condition of things constitutes a real danger,\r\nhow it will ultimately work out if left alone, and how the difficulty is\r\nto be met, are problems for statesmen which cannot be solved off-hand,\r\nbut require knowledge not only of the crude facts of statistics, but\r\nalso of the causes at work. Scientific knowledge—that is to say,\r\nthorough and unassailable knowledge—of the laws of heredity, of\r\npsychology, and of the natural history of human populations, are among\r\nthe essential qualifications for those who have to face and deal with\r\nthis difficult matter. And who is there who has this knowledge or is\r\neven trying to obtain it? Not the State in this country or its\r\nofficials: for in every department of government (however capable some\r\nof the subordinates may be) there is a determined opposition to and fear\r\nof Science on the part of the political and highly paid chiefs—the\r\njealous fear due to complete and deadly ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\nGOSSAMER\r\n\r\n\r\nFine as gossamer! Town-bred folks never see it, and do not believe in\r\nits existence; they think it is a poetical figment, like “honey-dew.”\r\nThat, too, is nevertheless a real thing—a honey-like juice poured out\r\nby the little plant-lice or aphides. Gossamer is a very real and a most\r\nbeautiful thing. You may see it on the hill-sides in fine October\r\nweather, when the sun is bright but low enough to illuminate the\r\ndelicate threads and reveal the “veil of silk and silver thin” spread\r\nover Nature’s loveliness. The innumerable threads glisten, and are so\r\nfine that they shine with iridescent colours, as do the equally delicate\r\nsoap-bubbles fabricated by men and boys, and from the same cause. When\r\nthe eye gets accustomed to them and traces them—rippling and glimmering\r\nover acres and acres of grass-land—one feels disconcerted, almost\r\nawestruck, by the revelation of this vast network of threads. Sometimes\r\nthe gentle currents of air break them loose from the herbage, and they\r\nfloat at a higher level and envelop the puzzled intruder in an almost\r\ninvisible entanglement of fairy lines. Sometimes they become felted\r\ntogether in flakes and float or rest as incredibly delicate tissue,\r\nwoven by unseen mysterious agency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.—A young spider (four times the natural length)\r\nraising its body upwards, whilst the four silk threads (gossamer) spun\r\nby it float in the air, and so draw out further liquid silk from the\r\nspider. They increase in length to three or four yards, when they float\r\nupwards, carrying the spider with them. (After McCook.)]\r\n\r\nWhen the slopes of the new golf course at Wimbledon were covered last\r\nautumn with gossamer, my friends were asking what was its origin, some\r\nboldly asserting that it was impossible that such a vast acreage of\r\nthreads could be produced, as others maintained, by tiny unseen spiders!\r\nYet that is the true history of gossamer. Hundreds of thousands of\r\nminute spiders, young, and of a small kind, are present in grass fields\r\nin autumn, and throw out these marvellously fine threads from their\r\nlittle bodies (Fig. 47). Those who at first sight doubt this origin of\r\ngossamer are only in accordance with their forefathers. The French\r\npeasants call it _fil de la Vierge_; old English writers held it to be\r\n“dew evaporated.” A great discoverer and leader of science in his time,\r\nRobert Hook, who was elected with Nehemiah Grew as secretary of the\r\nRoyal Society in 1677, and published a wonderful illustrated book called\r\n_Micrographia_ (see p. 173), wrote of gossamer. He was so far from\r\nrecognising its true nature that he says: “It is not unlikely that those\r\ngreat white clouds which appear all the summer time may be of the same\r\nsubstance.” Yet it is now a simple and certain fact of observation that\r\nthe countless threads in question are the work of minute spiders!\r\n\r\nThe pretty name “gossamer” has puzzled the etymologists and led to some\r\nfar-fetched suggestions. That favoured by the authority of the great\r\nOxford dictionary of the English language is that it is a corruption of\r\n“Go-summer,” because gossamer appears in autumn and is associated with\r\nSt. Martin’s summer. This is like saying that the word “cray-fish”\r\nrefers to fish that live in a “cray” or brook, instead of deriving it\r\nfrom the French word _écrevisse_. The Germans call gossamer\r\n_Sommerweben_. But the Latin word for cotton is _gossypium_; and there\r\nis an Italian word, _gossampino_, which occurs in an English form,\r\n_gossampine_, in the sixteenth century, and means a kind of silk or\r\ncotton obtained from the fluffy hairs of a plant called bombax. We also\r\nfind “gossamer” spelt “gossamire” in English of that date; and it seems\r\nto me most likely that an Italian word _gossamira_, signifying\r\n“fairy-cotton” or “magic goose-down,” is the origin of our word.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.—View of the lower surface of the head and body\r\nof a large Burmese spider, known as Liphistius, to show the spinnerets\r\n(3 and 4), which are really reduced or rudimentary legs, and are in this\r\nspider retained in their original position, instead of being pushed down\r\nto the end of the body, as they are in all other spiders (see Fig. 49,\r\n_spn_), I. to VI., the basal joints of the legs and palps of the\r\nhead-region; 1, the first abdominal segment; 2, the second; 3 and 4, the\r\nlegs of the third and fourth abdominal segments, which are the\r\nspinnerets; 11, the eleventh abdominal segment—in front of it rudiments\r\nof the segments 5 to 10 are seen; _an_, anus; _a_, _b_, inner and outer\r\nlobes of the first pair of spinnerets.]\r\n\r\nThere are 500 different kinds of spider carefully described as occurring\r\nin the British Islands, and about 2000 others from remoter regions.\r\nPrecisely which of them forms the “gossamer” of our meadows it is\r\ndifficult to say, as all have the habit of secreting a viscid fluid from\r\none or two pairs of projecting spinning knobs or stalks, which are seen\r\nat the hinder end of the body (Figs. 48, 49, and 50). The viscid fluid\r\nis poured out by a great number of minute tubes, and hardens at once\r\ninto a thread, which is wonderfully fine, yet strong. Different kinds of\r\nspiders make use of these threads for different purposes, hence their\r\nname “spinners.” Some make burrows in the ground and line them with a\r\nfelt of these threads, others enclose their eggs in a case formed by\r\nwinding them round the eggs, others form “snares” of the most marvellous\r\nmechanical ingenuity with them, by which insects are entangled and are\r\nthen paralysed by the poisonous stab of the spider’s claws, and have\r\ntheir juices sucked out of them at the spider’s leisure. The snares of\r\nspiders are in some species merely irregular webs fastened and suspended\r\nby threads, in other cases they are gracefully-modelled funnels or cups,\r\nwhilst a third kind, the disc-like webs made up of radiating and\r\ncircularly-disposed threads fixed in a geometrical pattern, excel—in\r\nthe mechanical precision of their workmanship and the masterly treatment\r\nof engineering difficulties—the constructions of any other kind of\r\nanimal. It is amongst this kind of spiders that the formation by the\r\nspinning knobs of threads or lines and their use in various ways is\r\nmost general and frequent. The smaller spiders expel the viscid thread,\r\ndrawing it out from their bodies by their own movement away from the\r\nobject to which it at first adhered. When it breaks loose from that\r\nsupport it is carried upwards by air-currents and drawn out from the\r\nspinners body to many yards’ length (Fig. 47). It then becomes a\r\n“flying-line,” and the spider may sail away on it or run up it and\r\ndisappear. The celebrated story of the Indian juggler’s\r\nperformance—traditional and even solemnly attested by witnesses, but\r\nfailing to pass the test of photography—must have been suggested by\r\nthis common, yet wonderful, proceeding of small spiders. The juggler,\r\nstanding in an open place, surrounded by a ring of spectators, uncoils a\r\nrope, 50 feet long, from his waist, and holding one end, throws the\r\nother up into the air. The rope, without any support, remains stretched\r\nand upright. A small boy now enters the ring and climbs up the rope,\r\ndraws it up after him, and disappears with it in the upper air! That is\r\nan illusion, but it is precisely what thousands of small spiders are\r\ncontinually doing. A big spider—the well-grown female of the common\r\ngarden spider, for instance, cannot do this—her thread is not strong\r\nenough, and her weight is too great. But the male of the same species,\r\nwho is much smaller, fortunately for him, can safely run on a hanging\r\nline—and thus can rapidly escape from the side of his mistress, who,\r\nafter receiving his caresses, has an unpleasant habit of seizing,\r\nkilling, and sucking the blood of the adventurous male, should he linger\r\nlonger in her company, and fail in the agility and rapidity of his exit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.—Section through the body of a spider to show\r\nthe spinning organs. _h_, heart connected by four big veins with _b_,\r\nthe lung-bosks or air-gills; _f_, genital lid; _ov_, ovary; _a_, the\r\nanus; _spn_, the three pairs of spinnerets or spinning warts; _c_, _e_,\r\nand _d_, the three kinds of glands producing liquid silk, viz.,\r\ncylindrical, tree-form, and pyriform. These are one thousand in number\r\nin the common garden spider, and each has its separate spout or spigot\r\nstanding up on one of the spinnerets (see next figure).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.—One of the two middle spinnerets of the common\r\ngarden spider (_Epeira diadema_), to show the three kinds of spouts or\r\nspigots (one thousand in all) corresponding to the three kinds of\r\nsilk-glands. Each kind of “spigot” pours out a different kind and size\r\nof thread. _sp.c_, one of the big spigots of the cylindrical glands;\r\n_sp.t_, middle-sized spigots belonging to the tree-form glands; _ss_ and\r\n_s.ss_, the small-sized spigots of the very numerous pyriform glands.]\r\n\r\nThe threads of the garden spider (the _Porte-croix_ of the French,\r\nwhite-cross spider, _Epeira diadema_, Fig. 51) are fixed by astronomers\r\nin their telescopes for the purpose of giving fine lines in the field of\r\nview, by which the relative positions of stars may be accurately\r\nmeasured. For a century astronomers desired to make use of such lines of\r\nthe greatest possible fineness, and procured at first silver wire drawn\r\nout to the extreme limit of tenuity attainable with that metal. They\r\nalso tried hairs (1/500th of an inch thick) and threads of a silk-worm’s\r\ncocoon, which are split into two component threads each only 1/2000th of\r\nan inch thick. But in 1820 an English instrument maker named Troughton\r\nintroduced the spider’s line. This can be readily obtained three or four\r\ntimes smaller in breadth than the silk-worm’s thread, and has also\r\nadvantages in its strength and freedom from twist. In order to obtain\r\nthe thread, the spider is carefully fixed on a miniature “rack,” and the\r\nthread, which at the moment of issue from the body is a viscid liquid,\r\nis made to adhere to a winder, by turning which the desired length of\r\nfirm but elastic thread can be procured. It has been proposed to use\r\nspiders’ silk in manufactures as a substitute for silk-worms’ silk, and\r\npioneers have woven gloves, stockings, and other articles from it. It\r\nappears that there are species of spider in other parts of the world\r\nwhose thread is coarser and more suitable for this purpose than that of\r\nany of our British spiders. But it is estimated that the expense in\r\nfeeding the spiders—which require insect food—would make the thread\r\nobtained from them far too costly to compete with silk-worm silk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.—The common garden spider, more correctly called\r\nthe white cross spider (_Epeira diadema_): a female drawn a little\r\n(one-fifth) larger than life.]\r\n\r\nA number of different kinds of the lower animals besides spiders have\r\nthe power of producing threads. The caterpillars of some moths are\r\nespecially noted for this, since their thread is familiar to us all as\r\n“silk.” It is secreted as a viscid fluid by a pair of tubes opening at\r\nthe mouth, and hardens on escape. Even some marine creatures—the\r\nmussels—produce threads, in this case from a gland or sac in the\r\nmuscular foot, by means of which they fix themselves to rocks. A very\r\nbig mussel—the _Pinna_—called _Capo lungo_ by the Mediterranean\r\nfishermen and _Capy longy_ at Plymouth, where they are also found,\r\nproduces a sufficient quantity of fine horny threads to be used in\r\nweaving, and gloves have been made at Genoa from the shell-fish silk.\r\n\r\nThe threads produced by the hardening of the tenacious fluid exuded by\r\nthese various animals were probably simply protective in origin. The\r\ncurious caterpillar-like creature _Peripatus_ spits out a viscid fluid\r\nwhen it is disturbed, which hardens into threads, and hopelessly\r\nentangles any small enemy which may venture to attack it. Threads of a\r\npoisonous nature are thrown out by jelly-fishes, polyps, and sea\r\nanemones, and serve them both as defence and as means of paralysing and\r\ncapturing prey. A later stage in the use of such threads is their\r\n“felting” to form a case or tube (as in the sea anemone called\r\n_Cerianthus_), and so their application has gradually developed to the\r\nformation of egg-cases, snares, and the wonderful web of the geometric\r\nspider, and the countless “flying-lines” of smaller spiders, which make\r\nup the mysterious thing we call “gossamer.”\r\n\r\nAs to the limits of the tenuity of the threads of gossamer there are no\r\ndirect observations. Probably they are often as fine as the 1/16,000th\r\nor 1/20,000th of an inch in diameter. The condensation of a very minute\r\nquantity of moisture on gossamer threads and spiders’ webs no doubt\r\nhelps to make them more readily visible to us in October weather than\r\nthey are in full summer, when such moisture would not condense except in\r\nearly morning or at sunset. It seems strange that man should have been\r\nunable to produce a thread so fine as that of the spider, but this\r\nreproach has now been removed. Spun glass is easily obtained 1/1000th of\r\na inch in diameter; but Mr. C. V. Boys, F.R.S., has, by fusing quartz\r\n(rock-crystal) by the oxy-hydrogen flame, and drawing it out by means of\r\na small arrow (a straw), discharged from a bow—the near end of the\r\narrow being adherent to a fused droplet of quartz which is held\r\nfast—produced threads of great strength and of extraordinary tenuity.\r\nThe fineness can be regulated by the rapidity with which the drawing is\r\neffected. The threads are prepared (for use in suspending swinging bars\r\nin delicate measurements of force) of a thickness of 1/10,000th of an\r\ninch. Some have been made so fine as to be not only invisible to the\r\nnaked eye, but to be only vaguely indicated by the highest powers of the\r\nmicroscope. They are estimated to be only one-millionth of an inch in\r\ndiameter. It is difficult to form any mental picture or conception of\r\nthese finest quartz threads spun by Mr. Boys. But the following fact\r\nhelps us to realise how delicate they are. A grain of sand just visible\r\nto the eye—that is to say, 1/100th an inch long, the same in breadth,\r\nand the same in height—would make twenty miles of such thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\nTHE JUMPING BEAN\r\n\r\n\r\nOne way of thinking of the six hundred thousand kinds or species of\r\ninsects—those tiny, ubiquitous fellow-creatures of ours which inhabit\r\nnearly every corner and cranny of the earth’s surface—is to associate\r\nthem with the plants upon which, either for food or protection, the\r\ngreater number of them are dependent. This makes them appear less\r\noverwhelming in their astonishing and, at first sight, meaningless\r\nvariety, than when one calls them to mind pinned out in long lines in\r\ninnumerable drawers and cases, or assorted, like with like, in the\r\nwonderfully accurate and interminable pictures of them produced by those\r\npatient benefactors of mankind the systematic entomologists. Every plant\r\nof any size has a number of insects associated with it, living more or\r\nless completely on its substance, or making its home in some part of the\r\nplant. Some trees are known to have more than a hundred and fifty kinds\r\nor species of insects thus dependent on them, those which are vegetarian\r\nserving in their turn as food to a variety of carnivorous insects.\r\n\r\nThe ways in which insects are associated with plants may be briefly\r\nstated. It must be remembered that often, though not always, one\r\nparticular species of plant, and that only, is capable of serving the\r\nneeds of a given species of insect. Thus, the leaves of a given plant\r\nare the necessary food of the grubs of one or more insects which bite\r\ntheir food; its internal juices serve others which suck; its roots\r\nothers; its nectar in the flower others, which in return serve the plant\r\nby carrying away its pollen and fertilising the other plants of the same\r\nspecies which they visit. Protection is sought and obtained from the\r\nsame plant by insects which burrow in its leaves, or roll them up, or\r\ncut them into slices and carry them away, or hide in its bark, or in the\r\nflowers, or in other parts—or burrow for food and shelter into its\r\nwood. Others lay their eggs in the soft buds, producing or not producing\r\naccording to their kind distorted growths, known as “galls” (one plant\r\nis known to have as many as thirty species of gall-flies which make use\r\nof it). Other insects lay their eggs in the flower-buds and immature\r\nfruits, or place them on the plant so that the young grubs, when\r\nhatched, can at once eat into those soft parts. Others bore into the\r\nwood or into hard or fleshy fruits expressly to lay their eggs, or into\r\nthe ripe seeds. Certain ants live in chambers specially provided by the\r\nwoody parts of the plant for them, and benefit both themselves and the\r\nplant by devouring other insects which seek the plant in order to devour\r\nit. In a museum of natural history there should be exhibited at least\r\none plant with specimens and enlarged models of all the insects which\r\ndepend upon it for food, protection, or nursery, and with accompanying\r\nillustrations of the way in which those purposes are served.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.—On the right two jumping beans; on the left the\r\ncaterpillar removed from a jumping bean. The figures are a little larger\r\nthan life-size, as is shown by the line drawn near the caterpillar\r\ngiving its actual length. The shape of the “beans,” as segments of a\r\ntripartite sphere, is seen. One shows a round hole, with a lid-like\r\npiece marked _a_, removed from the hole. This hole did not exist when\r\nthe bean first came into my possession in November 1908. At that time\r\nthe caterpillar within was active, and the bean or fruit-segment often\r\njumped. In April the caterpillar cut this round hole from within,\r\nleaving the circular lid in place, and became a chrysalis. The lid was\r\npushed out, as shown in the drawing, by the moth when it escaped from\r\nthe chrysalis in July. (Drawn from nature for this work.)]\r\n\r\nA curious product of the relationship of an insect and a plant is the\r\nso-called “jumping bean,” which is brought to this country from Mexico,\r\nand may be purchased in some of the London shops which deal in\r\n“miscellaneous” articles. They have been known for some years, but are\r\nbecoming now a regular article of commerce. As one buys them (Fig. 52)\r\nthey are segments of a globular fruit which has divided into three,\r\ncomparable to the familiar segments of an orange, but less numerous.\r\nThey are about one-third of an inch long, light, quite dry, and\r\napparently hollow, without any visible opening. Two sides of the little\r\ncapsule are flat, and the third side is bulged and rounded, so that the\r\ncapsule easily rocks when resting on that side. When these dry fruits or\r\nsegments of a fruit are brought into a warm room or placed near a fire\r\nso as to make them as warm as the hand, they commence to rock and move\r\nwith curious little jerks. They jump as much as one-eighth of an inch\r\nfrom the ground, and advance as much as a quarter of an inch at a time,\r\nthough by rolling they may progress a good deal more. They will often\r\nmove seven or eight times in the same direction so as to make a progress\r\nof a couple of inches on a flat surface, and I have found that if a cool\r\nsurface or protection from warmth is within reach they will in the\r\ncourse of time arrive at that cool area and come to rest. When the plate\r\non which they are placed becomes cool or the temperature of the room\r\nfalls to what we should call “chilly,” they cease to move, but can be\r\nroused again by renewed warmth.\r\n\r\nHow and why do these “beans,” or, rather, fruit-segments (for they are\r\nnot beans), move in this determined purposeful manner? The whole\r\nproceeding has a mysterious and uncanny aspect. They have no legs, no\r\nspring; they are simple little smooth capsules, and yet they jump and\r\nseemingly “walk” about. The explanation is that there is a grub inside\r\neach so-called “bean.” Cut one of the beans or capsules open, and you\r\nfind that it is a very thin-walled and hollow case, but coiled on itself\r\nin the cavity you open, and about half filling it, is a yellowish white\r\ngrub (Figs. 52 and 53). It is not a “maggot,” but a “caterpillar,” that\r\nis to say, it is not legless, but has eight pairs of legs—namely, three\r\npairs of short walking legs in front, four pairs of sucker-like legs,\r\nand a hinder pair of larger size called “claspers.” It has a hard brown\r\nplate on its head, and possesses hard jaws. It refuses to leave the\r\nopened capsule, and crawls back again if forcibly removed, and in the\r\ncourse of a few hours spins a silken cover to replace the piece of\r\n“shell” you have cut away. Mr. Rollo has lately succeeded in getting the\r\ncaterpillar to patch up its injured residence with a thin piece of\r\nglass, such as is used by microscopists, which he put in place of a side\r\nof the capsule removed by a knife. He was thus able subsequently to\r\nwatch through the glass the movements of the little creature when it\r\ncauses the mended capsule or “bean” to jump. It rears itself from the\r\nlower surface of the capsule, and gives a series of sharp blows to the\r\nroof, projecting its body with each blow, and thus overbalances the\r\ncapsule, or, if the flat side is lying downwards, jerks it along much as\r\none may sit with one’s feet on the rail of a chair and cause it to jerk\r\nalong the floor by the swinging movements of the body. The caterpillar\r\ndoes not die at once when removed from the capsule; it has been kept\r\nalive in a glass tube for a month.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.—The caterpillar of the moth, _Carpocapsa\r\nsaltitans_, removed from the jumping bean: magnified three diameters.\r\nObserve the jaws (with which the circular plate is cut in the bean\r\nbefore the grub becomes a chrysalis), eyes, three pairs of pointed legs,\r\nfour sucker legs placed in the middle region, and followed by three\r\nsegments without legs, and a terminal segment with a pair of suckers.\r\n(Drawn from nature for this work.)]\r\n\r\nSo far so good. The next questions are: What Mexican plant is it that\r\nforms the capsule or tripartite fruit in which the caterpillar is found?\r\nHow did the caterpillar get there? What kind of an insect does it turn\r\ninto, and when? I will answer the last question first. The caterpillar\r\nturns into a chrysalis in the early part of the year, having first cut a\r\nperfectly circular ring in the shell of the capsule. The circular plate\r\nthus within the ring is not disturbed, and cannot be observed without\r\nvery close inspection. The making of this perfectly circular cut without\r\nremoving the piece marked out must be effected by a rotation of the\r\ncaterpillar’s head and jaws as a centre-bit—an astonishing performance.\r\nBut when the moth emerges from the chrysalis, a gentle push is enough to\r\ncause the little circular plate to fall out, and the moth creeps through\r\nthe hole to the outer world. The moth, which comes out of the\r\nchrysalis-coat, is a very pretty little creature (see Fig. 54),\r\nmeasuring two-thirds of an inch across the opened wings, which are\r\nmarked with dark and reddish-brown-coloured bands. It is a close ally of\r\nthe British codling moth, the caterpillar of which eats its way into the\r\ncore of apples, and is familiar to all growers and eaters of that fruit.\r\nThe codling moth and the Mexican “jumper” belong to a group of small\r\nmoths called _Tortricinæ_, and they are named respectively _Carpocapsa\r\nsaltitans_ (the one whose grub or caterpillar inhabits the “jumping\r\nbean”) and _Carpocapsa pomonana_, the codling moth. There are other\r\nBritish species of _Carpocapsa_, the grubs of which eat into the acorn,\r\nthe walnut, the chestnut, and the beechnut—a distinct kind or species\r\nfor each. None of these grubs cause the nuts they attack to “jump.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.—The moth, _Carpocapsa saltitans_, which escapes\r\nfrom the jumping bean or segment of the fruit of the Mexican spurge,\r\n_Sebastiana palmeri_, in which its caterpillar and chrysalis have passed\r\ntheir lives. The crossed lines indicate the natural size of the moth.\r\n(Drawn from nature for this work.)]\r\n\r\nThe “jumping bean” of Mexico is a segment of the triply divided fruit of\r\na large spurge, which is called _Sebastiana palmeri_. The spurges are\r\nknown in England as little green-leaved annuals, with yellow-green\r\nflowers and a milky juice. Botanists call them the _Euphorbiaceæ_, and\r\nin that “natural order” are included the boxwood tree and some tropical\r\ntrees of great value and importance. None other than the Brazilian\r\nindiarubber tree, Hevea, of which we hear so much nowadays, its rubber\r\nto the value of £14,000,000 being exported every year from Brazil, is\r\none of them. So also is the Chinese candle-tree, which furnishes a\r\ntallow-like fat, made into candles in China. Others are the croton oil\r\nand the castor oil shrubs, natives of India, and the manihot or tapioca\r\nplant. The fruits of _Sebastiana_ (the jumping bean) are very much like\r\nthose of the croton; and as there are crotons (though not the one of the\r\npurgative oil) in abundance in Mexico, it has taken some time to make\r\nsure that the “jumping bean” is not the fruit of a croton, but that of\r\nthe allied plant _Sebastiana_. It appears that there is no commercial\r\nvalue for this plant, and that those capsules which happen to contain a\r\ngrub and move are collected from the ground by the native Mexican boys\r\nand sold as curiosities.\r\n\r\nThe moth (_Carpocapsa saltitans_) lays its eggs on the Sebastian shrub,\r\nand the young grub, on hatching, eats its way into the young fruit when\r\nthe latter is still quite soft and the seed unformed, and so leaves no\r\nhole to mark its entrance. As the fruit swells the grub eats out the\r\nseed and surrounding pulp of the segment of the fruit into which it\r\nentered early in life. By the time the fruits are dry and fall to the\r\nground the caterpillar is fully grown. Of course, it is only a very few\r\nof the capsules which are thus invaded by a grub.\r\n\r\nThe question very naturally arises, “Why should the caterpillar put\r\nitself to the great muscular effort of making the little capsule in\r\nwhich it is contained jump and move over the ground?” It seems probable\r\nthat these movements are made in order to bring the capsule from an\r\nexposed position when it falls on to the ground—where it might be\r\ncrushed or eaten by some animal—into a position of shelter, either into\r\na hole, or under some stone or fallen wood. The warmth of the sun in an\r\nexposed position excites the caterpillar to activity, which ceases when\r\nit has reached the shade offered by some protecting cranny. In the same\r\nway I have applied artificial heat and, alternatively, shelter from\r\nheat, so as to cause the movements or the resting of the jumping bean in\r\na London sitting-room.\r\n\r\nThese things and others of absorbing interest may be seen in the truly\r\nwonderful museum of Kew Gardens, where perhaps the visitor will be\r\ndisposed to spend more time in cold weather than in the summer. The park\r\nat Kew Gardens, with its splendid forest and lakes, and its Italian\r\ntower, is one of the beautiful things of England, and it has a special\r\nquality even in this season of mist and veiled sunshine. I found there\r\nrecently, under the trees, as I did fifty years ago, a rare and\r\nstrange-looking fungus, the _Phallus impudicus_ of botanists,—a furtive\r\ndenizen of the glades which in late spring are purple with wild\r\nhyacinths. The same spot in June presents within a few minutes’ journey\r\nfrom the smoke and smell and noise of Piccadilly a perfect sample of\r\nwhat is, perhaps, the most beautiful sight in Nature—bright sunlight\r\nbreaking through the young green leaves of a forest on to green herbage.\r\nAnd close by are the azaleas!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\nPROTECTIVE COLOURING IN ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one is familiar with some of the instances in which the natural\r\ncolour of an animal helps to hide it from view. Green caterpillars, for\r\ninstance, are less visible when among the green leaves which they eat\r\nthan they would be were they brown, blue, red, yellow, or black. The\r\nlittle green tree-frog is difficult to see when he is clinging to a\r\nleaf, because his colour is the same as that of the leaf.\r\nSandy-brown-coloured animals, birds, reptiles, and beasts of prey, are\r\nfound on the sands of the desert; white birds, foxes, hares, and bears\r\non the Arctic snow. The similarity of the colouring of these animals to\r\nthat of the ground on which they live results in their escaping the\r\nobservation of man’s eye, and we are entitled to believe that they\r\nescape for the same reason the observation of other animals. They are\r\nthus in many cases protected from the attacks of enemies searching for\r\nthem as prey, or in other cases they may themselves be enabled the more\r\neasily in consequence of their concealing colour to creep upon other\r\nanimals and seize them as food. Some of the simpler cases of this\r\nresemblance between an animal and its surroundings are easy to observe,\r\nand the value of the resemblance as protection, or as a means of secret\r\nattack, is plain enough.\r\n\r\nBut there are far more numerous cases in which the significance of\r\ncolour as concealment, is not so immediately obvious. There are the\r\ncurious stick insects, with long bodies and delicate long legs,\r\nsometimes with bud-like knobs on the body which look like bits of the\r\nbranches of trees, not merely on account of their colour, but on account\r\nof their shape. Shape or modelling has a great deal to do with the\r\neffective concealment of an animal. Then, too, there is the curious fact\r\nthat some insects (and also some birds) when at rest on the stems of\r\ntrees, are practically invisible, but if they spread their wings are\r\nconspicuous. The beech-leaf butterfly of Assam and Africa is of a purple\r\ncolour, marked with a great orange-coloured bar on each fore-wing when\r\nthe wings are open, and it is obvious enough. But when the wings are\r\nclosed and the insect is at rest, the undersides only are seen, and are\r\ncoloured so as to represent the veining and fungus marks of a dry brown\r\nleaf, so that not even a human observer, let alone a bird or a lizard,\r\ncan distinguish at two-feet distance the butterfly from dried leaves\r\nplaced near it.\r\n\r\nA well-known little moth, with pale green mottled wings, is the only\r\ncase in which I have myself watched the protection afforded by colour at\r\nwork. It was on a summer’s evening, when I saw this little moth\r\nzigzagging up and down with the most extraordinarily irregular flight,\r\nand a bird pursuing it. Twice the bird swooped and just missed his prey\r\nowing to a sudden turn and drop on the part of the moth. And then to my\r\ngreat delight the moth flopped against the stem of a tree on which was\r\ngrowing a greenish-grey lichen. The bird swooped again close to the\r\ntree, but failed to see the insect, and quitted the chase. It took me an\r\nappreciable time to detect the little moth resting against the lichen,\r\nand closely matching it in colour. There are endless examples known of\r\nsuch “protective resemblances,” some of them (such as that of the\r\nbuff-tip moth, which, with its wings closed, looks like a broken birch\r\ntwig) being most unexpected and fascinating. In the forests of\r\nMadagascar, the whitish-grey tree lichens are imitated by thread-like\r\ngrowths on beetles, tree-bugs, locusts, and even lizards, with a\r\nwonderful concealing effect, and some other flat membrane-like insects\r\nare so much like the greenish and yellowish bark of trees, that we\r\nactually lost a specimen for some time in the case labelled “Mimicry,”\r\nin which a series of these things was arranged by me for the edification\r\nof visitors to the Natural History Museum. It was found, after a day or\r\ntwo, to have been present all the time with other specimens on a piece\r\nof bark, from which it was indistinguishable.\r\n\r\nSome eight years ago a distinguished American painter, Mr. Abbott\r\nThayer, was able to add very importantly to our knowledge of the ways in\r\nwhich colour serves to conceal animals when in their natural\r\nsurroundings. Mr. Thayer was able to do this owing to the fact that he\r\nwas a devoted student of woodland life. This, however, alone was not\r\nenough. Mr. Thayer had the special ability to deal with this subject\r\nwhich comes from the trained eye of an artist. He had, above all, the\r\nknowledge of “tone values” and of the illusive and delusive effects of\r\nfalse shading and of colour-spots and bars, and of complementary colours\r\nand “irradiation”—which only a painter who deals every day in the most\r\npractical way with these matters can attain to. Mr. Thayer showed eight\r\nyears ago—and demonstrated conclusively by means of models, one of\r\nwhich he presented to the Natural History Museum at my request—that in\r\nvery many cases it is of no use for an animal to be of the same colour\r\nas its surroundings, since if the animal (a bird, or a quadruped, or a\r\nfish) is of plump and rounded shape and is observed under the open\r\ncanopy of heaven, a deep shadow will exist on its lower surface and make\r\nit as obvious as a shaded charcoal drawing on a piece of light-brown\r\npaper. But if the back of the animal is of a dark tint and its belly\r\nwhite or whitish, then the effect of light and shade is (Mr. Thayer\r\nshowed) completely counteracted and the animal becomes totally invisible\r\nin its natural surroundings.\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer’s model demonstrating this consists of two life-size wooden\r\nmodels of ducks seated on a stick—one to the left, the other to the\r\nright. The stick, with the two models on it, is fixed horizontally in a\r\nbox, which is open above (that is, has no lid) and is also open in\r\nfront. The box is, in fact, a little stage, lit from above by the light\r\nof the sky, and its three remaining sides are sufficiently high to form\r\na complete background to the model ducks, whose perch runs across the\r\n“scene” at some 7 in. or 8 in. from the floor of the box. The box itself\r\nis lined with a pale purplish-brown flannel, and each bird is tightly\r\ncovered with the same material. When so prepared the box is placed on a\r\ntable under a skylight (where it is to stay), the table being high\r\nenough to bring the ducks just below the line of sight. Of course, deep\r\nshadows are formed by the top-light on the under side of the beak, head,\r\nand body of the models, and in spite of their colour being itself\r\nidentical with that of the walls of the box, they are as obvious as it\r\nis possible for anything to be. Now Mr. Thayer takes his paints and very\r\ncarefully darkens the back of one of the ducks and whitens its belly and\r\nthe under side of its head and beak. The light and dark regions merge\r\ninto one another along the side of the bird by skilful gradation. When\r\nthis shading and whitening is finished (and, of course, the perfection\r\nof the result depends on the continuance of the right amount of\r\nsunlight, which is not a thing one can always ensure in a London\r\nmuseum) the duck-model so treated is absolutely invisible at a distance\r\nof 10 ft. or 15 ft.—and even when one is nearer escapes notice—looking\r\nlike a haze or vague shadow of a bird even to an observer who knows\r\nnevertheless that it is there and is really as solid and large as the\r\nuntreated model by its side. If now some one stretches out his hand so\r\nas to cut off the top-light falling on the painted model, it immediately\r\nbecomes as solid to the eye as the untreated one, and when the hand is\r\nwithdrawn it melts away again like Banquo’s ghost. The models made by\r\nMr. Thayer were, so long as I was director, exhibited in the small room\r\nbetween the fish gallery and the central hall of the Natural History\r\nMuseum, and, if they have not yet been removed, are well worth a visit.\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer’s models work perfectly, and astonish every one who sees\r\nthem. The great point of interest about them, however, is, that the bird\r\nwith dark back and light belly is really in the condition which is quite\r\ncommon in a number of birds, especially ducks and wading birds, where it\r\nmust act as a means of concealing the bird—just as it does in the\r\npainted model. Of course, there are vast numbers of birds not so shaded,\r\nbut it is possible to explain the darker and lighter colouring, in\r\nvarious arrangements seen in birds, as helping to produce concealment or\r\ndisappearance from view, when the habits and natural surroundings of the\r\nbird are known. So, too, with many hairy quadrupeds (mammals, or\r\n“animals,” or “beasts,” as they are often called). The white hair under\r\nthe tail and about the rump, helps a running animal to escape the vision\r\nof its pursuer—blending, as Mr. Thayer shows that it does—with the\r\nwhite colour of the sky-line. In the case of fish—especially\r\nfresh-water fish—the dark back and light belly are very common, and\r\nalthough they do not help to conceal the fish when seen from above,\r\nswimming over a light-coloured river-bed, yet when looked at by other\r\nfishes or by otters in the water, the effect of the light from above on\r\nthis disposition of dark and light tints on the fish’s body must be the\r\nsame as that demonstrated by Mr. Thayer’s “disappearing duck,” and must\r\noften render the fish absolutely invisible, even at close quarters.\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer has pursued this subject during the past seven years, and\r\nlast autumn he gave some interesting demonstrations in the Zoological\r\nGardens in London. He showed a model of a white egret, which was but\r\nlittle noticeable when standing up clear against a bright, white-clouded\r\nsky. The long plumes on the wings, developed in the breeding season,\r\nwere shown (by putting them on and taking them off) to assist in causing\r\ninvisibility, since they made the side of the body flat and concealed\r\nthe shadow on its rounded underside. A similar bird-model marked with\r\nstrong black on the neck and legs—the rest being white—refused (so to\r\nspeak) to shape itself as a bird at all, and looked at a distance of\r\ntwenty yards like a bit of rock or stump of wood with a twig and dead\r\nleaf attached. The effect of different tones of brown cardboard cut into\r\nthe form of a butterfly, when seen on different backgrounds, was shown;\r\nbut the most interesting experiment was made with a black-green piece of\r\ncloth cut to the shape of a butterfly and fastened on to a sheet of\r\ndead-black cloth in the open air, in the presence of white cloud light\r\nof moderate brilliancy. At five yards one could see the outline of the\r\ndark-green butterfly-shaped piece; at fifteen yards one could just\r\ndistinguish the edge separating the dark-green piece from the black\r\ncloth. Now Mr. Thayer stuck in the middle of the dark-green\r\nbutterfly-wing a small circle of pure white (about one-third of an inch\r\nacross). The effect was entirely to obliterate the previously visible\r\nedge; one could no longer see the dark-green area at all—one only saw\r\na white spot on a continuous dark ground, the dark-green and the black\r\nwere merged into one. That is no doubt due to the powerful stimulation\r\nof the sensitive “retina” of the eye by the white light of the spot; the\r\nfeeble stimulation by the dark-green and black, though these remain\r\nphysically as distinct from one another as before, ceases to affect the\r\nbrain, which is, as it were, entirely occupied with the strong white\r\nspot. This, according to Mr. Thayer, is the value to butterflies and\r\nother animals of a violently contrasted white spot or band on a dark\r\ngeneral colouring. The fringe of white dots and connected white flakes\r\nnearer the centre of the wing—common on the wings of butterflies—has,\r\nsimilarly, the result of rendering the wing-outline imperceptible and\r\nthe butterfly invisible. Many such relations of colour spots and bands,\r\nas well as of dark and light markings, have been elucidated by Mr.\r\nThayer, and will be illustrated by coloured drawings in the book which\r\nhe is preparing on the subject.\r\n\r\nWhile it is the fact that Mr. Thayer has thrown new light on the\r\ncolour-protection and invisibility of animals, it must be remembered\r\nthat there are other explanations of certain cases of brilliant\r\ncolouring in animals besides that which he has so well illustrated.\r\n“Warning” colours, recognition marks, and sexually attractive colouring\r\nall certainly and demonstrably exist in well-known and well-studied\r\nkinds of animals. It is very possible that some of these colour-markings\r\nhave been produced by a slight change in what were previously\r\n“concealing” patterns or colour-markings. The tendency of the human\r\nobserver is to regard any colour, spot, or pattern on a bird, fish,\r\nbeast, or insect as a “mark” or distinguishing “sign.” We examine these\r\nthings at close quarters, and do not, unless we reflect a good deal on\r\nthe matter and experiment with the object, realise that what is a mark\r\nof distinction or recognition when seen at a few inches’ distance may be\r\nan illusive and obscuring colour-scheme when seen at a distance of some\r\nfeet, and in natural and habitual surroundings. It is not unlikely that\r\nwe shall arrive at definite knowledge of the psychological “sight\r\ninterpretations” of animals by a further study of this subject. It is in\r\nthe highest degree probable that the retinal picture produced in an\r\nanimal’s eye by certain spots of colour, shade, and light exhibited by\r\nanother animal, are not interpreted by the receptive animal in the same\r\nway as they would be by a scrutinising, inquiring, reasoning man, even\r\none who is what we call a “savage.” Moreover, though many English\r\nnaturalists have travelled and seen “life and light” in the sunny\r\nregions of the earth, there are few students of the colour-markings of\r\nanimals in our museums, especially in great cities, who have adequate\r\nexperience of what colour-markings really can effect in the way of\r\nconcealment and illusion when light and surrounding objects are as they\r\nare, in the tropics or sub-tropical regions. It is a fashion nowadays in\r\nthe best-provided museums of natural history to exhibit stuffed beasts,\r\nbirds, and insects in what are called “their natural surroundings.” The\r\nfatal objection to such exhibitions is that were the beasts, birds, and\r\ninsects placed in their most usual “natural surroundings,” they would be\r\ninvisible!\r\n\r\nIt is the merit of Mr. Thayer to have drawn attention to these\r\nconsiderations, and to have carried out some interesting demonstrations\r\nof the more frequent significance of colour-markings as means of\r\nconcealment and illusion than had been recognised before his work. At\r\nthe same time, it is not possible to consider the yellow and black\r\nlivery of wasps, of certain evil-tasting grubs, and of poisonous\r\nsalamanders as anything but a “danger-flag,” a warning to other animals\r\nthat the yellow and black animal had better not be bitten and tasted. So\r\nthe previous experience of animals who have bitten yellow and black\r\ncreatures is appealed to, and ensures the safety of the yellow and black\r\ngentry from tentative bites which would kill them. Other recognition\r\nmarks by which ill-tasting, nauseous butterflies are distinguished, and\r\nin consequence of which they escape attack, and, not only that, but are\r\n“mimicked” (as the yellow and black poisonous wasp is mimicked by some\r\ninnocuous flies which thus escape attack) by other pleasant-tasting\r\nbutterflies which fly with them, are considered by Mr. Thayer to be\r\nwrongly interpreted as recognition or “warning” marks. He shows, with\r\nmore or less success, that the markings of the butterflies known as\r\nHeliconiæ are effective as concealment, and is therefore inclined to\r\ndeny their value as “warning” marks, serving to indicate a noxious\r\nquarry best left untasted.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, quite possible that what are “concealment markings”\r\nwhen viewed by an aggressive bird or lizard at a distance, may be\r\nrecognised as “warning marks” when seen by the same observers at close\r\nquarters, and it is also possible that the latter may have become the\r\nmore important or only important result of the colour marks of a given\r\nbutterfly which were once useful as “concealment.” The possible change\r\nof significance of colour spots and markings in wild animals may be\r\nillustrated by the effect on human beings of the burglar’s crêpe mask.\r\nAt the present moment probably the most prominent result of the\r\nappearance in a house full of people in the dead of night of a man with\r\na crêpe mask over his face would be terror to those who saw him. The\r\nmask would be interpreted as a “mark” or “sign” of evil, not to say\r\nviolent intentions on the part of the masked man. It would be a “warning\r\ncolour,” and most unathletic individuals would severely avoid it; in\r\nfact, retire from it in alarm. But actually, the burglar’s mask—as\r\npossibly some noxious insects’ distinctive markings—was not invented\r\nfor the purpose of causing alarm. Far from it! The burglar, or nocturnal\r\nmalefactor, dons his crêpe mask in order to cover the white glitter of\r\nhis face, and so to escape observation. In origin it is a protective\r\ncoloration leading to invisibility, and only secondarily has it become a\r\n“warning colour” or “mark” at close quarters. There will be much more\r\nascertained, and much instructive discussion as to the colours and\r\nmarkings of not only animals, but also of flowers and foliage, before\r\nthis wonderful subject is thrashed out. I have only been able here to\r\nindicate its outlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\nHOP-BLIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nHops have for many years now been a very uncertain investment for those\r\nwho, in England, devote capital to the growing, drying, and marketing of\r\nthis crop. In some years a fortune may be made, in some years a dead\r\nloss, in many a bare return of expenditure. Hence, it is not surprising\r\nthat English hop-growers should wish for legislation which shall make\r\ntheir business more secure by taxing the hops produced in other\r\ncountries, and imported by our brewers. The whole subject of “hops” is a\r\nvery complicated one. It is the fact that every plant and animal\r\ncultivated by civilised man has led to the accumulation of an\r\nastonishing amount of detailed knowledge and experience in each case,\r\nand that there are increasing difficulties and surprises in regard to\r\nvarieties, and the competition of new supplies brought from all quarters\r\nof the globe. New areas of cultivation, new methods of transport, new\r\nfashion and taste continually disturb, and even destroy, old-established\r\nindustries. It is for statesmen to consider how far the remorseless\r\ncurrent of unforeseen changes should be checked and manipulated, so as\r\nto prevent disaster in the old-established and flourishing industries of\r\nthe countryside.\r\n\r\nThe hop (called _Humulus lupulus_ by botanists) is a native of this\r\ncountry, and of the more temperate parts of Europe. The Greeks and\r\nRomans never made “beer,” and were unacquainted with the use of the hop.\r\nMore than a thousand years ago the German and Scandinavian peoples made\r\nuse of various fragrant herbs (sweet gale, bark of tamarisk and oak) to\r\nflavour the sweet beer which they brewed from malted grain, just as\r\nborage, cucumber, and other plants are still used to flavour “cups.”\r\nWild hops were used, amongst other herbs, for this purpose, and\r\ngradually—but only gradually—became the favourite source of flavour.\r\nThe hop owes its selection not merely to its bitter tonic quality, but\r\nalso to its wonderful and most delicate perfume. Not only that, but the\r\nhop is found to be effective in checking continued fermentation and\r\nsouring—and also to have a narcotic sleep-producing quality, for which\r\nit is still used medicinally. Distinct chemical compounds are found in\r\nhops to which these several properties are due. A warm “hop-pillow”—a\r\npillow stuffed with dried hop-flowers—has given, and still gives, sleep\r\nto many a wakeful countryman. The older use of other fragrant plants in\r\nthe making of beer survives in some foreign beers, such as the Norwegian\r\nale, the beer of Louvain, and the “green” spruce-beer of Jena.\r\n\r\nHops were first cultivated with a view to obtaining varieties which\r\nwould furnish abundant and large, well-flavoured flower-heads. The\r\nflower-heads are “cones,” consisting of numerous minute flowers,\r\nprotected by overlapping green-coloured scales or bracts. The cultivated\r\nhop was brought to this country in the time of Henry VIII, and the\r\ncultivation of hops in hop-gardens and the skilful drying of the\r\nflower-heads in large bulk was commenced, and regulated by law. The male\r\nor pollen-producing hop-vine is distinct from the female seed-bearing\r\nhop-vine; it is the female flower-cone which carries the valuable\r\nfragrant and resinous products which the brewer desires. Hops are\r\nartificially propagated by root-cuttings, and it is interesting to note\r\nthat the hop-grower finds that it is not desirable to allow the female\r\nflowers to be fertilised, since, although the hops weigh more after the\r\nsetting of the seed, the valuable extractive substances contained in the\r\nflower are diminished, used up in the growth of the seed. Hence, often\r\nonly one male hop-vine to every 200 female hop-vines is allowed in a\r\nhop-garden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.—Early winged female hop-louse, produced\r\nviviparously by the first generation of daughters of the “Foundress,”\r\nFig. 58. These winged females migrate from the plum tree, where they\r\nwere born, to the hop-vines by aid of their wings, and produce\r\nviviparously the form drawn in Fig. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.—Male hop-louse, not appearing until late\r\nautumn.]\r\n\r\nIt does not follow because a plant is a native of a given country that\r\nit can be easily cultivated anywhere in that country, or that its finest\r\ncultivated varieties will be hardy. Only a few limited territories\r\n(owing to the nature of the soil, climate, and exposure) in Germany\r\n(chiefly in Bavaria), and in Kent, Sussex, Worcestershire, and\r\nHerefordshire, seem to be really favourable to hop-growing in Europe.\r\nCertain parts of the Pacific coast of the United States have of late\r\nyears proved a very successful ground, although hops were introduced\r\nfrom Europe and first cultivated with considerable success in the State\r\nof New York. The same dangers and troubles attend the hop-crop in all\r\nthese regions. These are blight, red-spider, mildew and mould, besides\r\nseveral less important insect pests. The hop-blight, or “black-blight,”\r\nis a plant-louse or aphis (Fig. 55) like the rose-aphis, and does great\r\nand increasing damage to the hop-crop in England, destroying the young\r\nand tender shoots in the months of June and July. In 1882 the hop-crop\r\nwas reduced from 459,000 cwt. (of the preceding year) to 115,000 cwt. by\r\nthis insect, and the wages paid for hop-picking from £350,000 to\r\n£150,000. These figures give an idea both of the damage done by blight\r\nand of the amount and value of the annual crop, for the mere picking of\r\nwhich so large a payment is made. Red-spider is a small mite or acarid\r\nwhich has done a good deal of damage in Kent. But mildew and mould are\r\nmore serious. These are due to a delicate, thread-like kind of fungus,\r\nwhich spreads on the leaf. Many kinds are known in various parts of the\r\nworld and on various plants. They may grow on one kind of plant without\r\ndoing injury to it, but if they get on to another, cause deadly\r\ndestruction of the foliage. It was an otherwise harmless mould, or\r\nleaf-fungus, which destroyed the coffee plantations of Ceylon. It had\r\nlived in the Ceylon forests on other plants without attracting notice;\r\nbut when the coffee tree was introduced and cultivated in large areas,\r\nthis little fungus seized on it, grew with terrible activity, and\r\nreceived the name “vastatrix” from the botanists who traced its history,\r\nand showed that it was the destroyer of the coffee plantations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.—Ordinary wingless female hop-louse, multiplying\r\nparthenogenetically throughout the summer.]\r\n\r\nHop-growers are constantly contending with these pests in the same way\r\nas other growers of crops have to contend with similar pests, but the\r\nhop-growers have the more difficult and delicate “patient” to steer\r\nthrough its diseases. The finest kinds of hops are not robust; it is a\r\nchance whether or no they will suffer from a wet and cold season, or\r\nother irregularity of climate, to such a degree as to fall ready victims\r\nto blight and mildew. Yet they pay better, provided the season is\r\nfavourable, and so the grower risks planting the fine, delicate variety\r\ninstead of being content with the more certain but smaller profits\r\nyielded by a more robust variety of hop. The hop-lice, or blight\r\ninsects, are destroyed by washing with soft soap and quassia—a process\r\nrequiring, even when a machine is used, a good deal of care and labour.\r\nMildew and mould are destroyed and also prevented by dusting the\r\nhop-vines in hot summer weather with finely powdered sulphur. But both\r\ndiseases can be combated by keeping the source of infection away from\r\nthe hop-garden. The mould-fungus can be checked by burning all leaves\r\nand plants attacked by it within the hop-garden. If the infected leaves\r\nare left to rot they carry on the parasitic fungus to a new season.\r\n\r\nAn interesting fact has been discovered about the hop-blight aphis\r\n(called by zoologists _Phorodon humuli_). It appears that the winter\r\nbrood of this little insect (when the hop-vine has died down) deposit\r\ntheir eggs on the bark of the sloe (the wild plum), and also that any\r\ncultivated plum trees serve them for the same purpose. When the hop is\r\ndead they must of necessity get nourishment and shelter from the plum\r\ntree. Clearly, then, if you can keep all plum trees at a distance of\r\nhalf a mile from your hop-garden you will render it very difficult, if\r\nnot impossible, for the blight aphis to carry on from season to season.\r\nIt will rarely, if ever, travel half a mile, and not in any number. But\r\nhop-growers have not always the control of the cultivation for half a\r\nmile around their hop-fields, though large growers should be able to\r\nacquire it. The skilful grower even finds it useful to leave one or two\r\nplum trees in the hop-field, so as to attract the winter brood of the\r\nblight aphis to them, and then he falls upon the devastating but minute\r\nrascals with quassia and other poisons, and ensures their destruction.\r\nThe increase of plum orchards in the neighbourhood of hop-gardens is\r\nprobably a chief cause of the increased loss by hop-blight of late years\r\nin Kent.\r\n\r\nThe hop-louse has other enemies besides the grower. These are the\r\nlady-birds (less prettily called “lady-bugs”), which feed greedily on\r\nthe parasites, so that when the hop-grower sees plenty of them on a\r\nhop-vine he does not trouble to wash it. And there are other predaceous\r\ninsects which tend to keep the hop-lice down. Cultivation and excessive\r\nproduction have resulted in putting, as it were, too heavy a task upon\r\nthe natural enemies of the pest, whilst the more delicate but valuable\r\nvarieties of hop cannot withstand the attacks of blight, which less\r\nvaluable varieties would tolerate without fatal injury.\r\n\r\nAnother complicated and difficult problem for the hop-grower is the\r\n“curing” of the hops when gathered. He has to arrange to grow a number\r\nof varieties which will not be all ready for picking at the same moment,\r\nso that the hop-pickers may be employed for some six weeks, and gather\r\neach kind at the exact time of ripeness. Then the gathered hops have to\r\nbe “dried” and “cured.” In Germany (where the highest-priced hops are\r\nproduced) small cultivators dry them in the sun, and they are “cured” by\r\nthe purchaser, but in England they are dried in kilns (called “oasts” in\r\nKent) near the hop-grounds. They are cured with sulphur fumes on the\r\nspot as soon as dried. The object of the drying and curing is quickly to\r\nget rid of the water, which forms 75 per cent. of the weight of the\r\ngreen flower-heads, but is reduced by drying to 10 per cent., and to\r\ndestroy the “mould” (fungus) which may be present, and to keep the hops\r\nfree from new access of mould by the slight deposit of sulphur fumes on\r\ntheir surface. The drying and fumigating require a great deal of skill,\r\nand a fine crop may be injured or even rendered worthless by want of\r\ncare, rapidity, and judgment in treating the freshly gathered\r\nflower-cones. It is said that it takes years to acquire the art, and\r\nthat skilled hop-curers are more difficult to obtain than formerly.\r\n\r\nThe natural difficulties and fluctuations with which the English\r\nhop-grower has to contend are made far more serious by the fact that he\r\ndoes not know what will be the yield of the American and German\r\nhop-plantations, and so cannot prepare beforehand for the demands of the\r\nmarket. It appears that ice-storage is now being made use of in some\r\ndistricts to hold over any excess of produce of particular kinds of hop\r\nbeyond the special demand for those kinds. But a formidable source of\r\ntrouble exists (and, it appears, must always exist) in the enormous\r\nchanges and expansion of the brewing industry in all parts of the globe.\r\nIt is actually the case that there has been a greatly increased and\r\nunforeseen demand for hops of less highly developed aroma, for the\r\npurpose of brewing light ales with little of the perfume given by the\r\nfinest and hitherto most highly priced hops. So that, having expended\r\nskill and money to produce the finest hops, and having been favoured by\r\nthe weather, a grower may find that his pains have been thrown away, and\r\nthat there is a sudden falling-off in the demand for the beautiful\r\nhigh-priced crop which he has gathered in. There is no remedy for these\r\nworld-wide fluctuations in the market, and the only way in which the\r\ngrower can protect himself is by combining with others to procure\r\ninformation from every part of the world as to the probable production\r\nand the probable demand of the various qualities of hops a year or more\r\nin advance of his planting. More has been done in America and in Germany\r\nin this way than in England, and it is probable that the future success\r\nor failure of hop-growing in this country depends more on the\r\npossibility of obtaining correct information in regard to the tendencies\r\nof production in all hop-growing countries, and in regard to the demand\r\nin all the brewing industries of the world, than on anything else.\r\n\r\nThis brief sketch of the hop-growing industry is sufficient to show what\r\na very difficult problem is before those who desire to take legislative\r\nmeasures for the preservation of the old industry of the hop-garden in\r\nthis country. But it must not be at once assumed, because the case is a\r\ndifficult and complicated one, that nothing can be done, and that the\r\nbeautiful hop-vines and the finest hops are necessarily to be banished\r\nfrom the English soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\nGREEN-FLIES, PLANT-LICE, AND PARTHENOGENESIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe minute “green-flies” which attack all kinds of plants, and among\r\nwhich are ranked the hop-louse or hop-blight, the rose aphis or\r\ngreen-fly of rose trees, the woolly blight or aphis of apple trees and\r\npear trees, and the terrible vine-killer—the _Phylloxera\r\nvastatrix_—form a special group of bug-like insects known as the\r\nAphides. They have soft cylindrical bodies, six legs, sometimes two\r\npairs of transparent wings, sometimes none, and a sharp beak (in some\r\nkinds this is one and a half times as long as the body), with which they\r\nprick the soft parts of plants, when they suck up the juices which issue\r\nfrom the wound (Fig. 59). There is in the temperate regions of the world\r\na special kind of aphis or plant-louse peculiar to each of many kinds of\r\nflowering plants, including most trees. A very complete, illustrated\r\naccount of the kinds or species of British aphides, amounting to some\r\ntwo hundred, was produced by the late Mr. Buckton, F.R.S., and published\r\nby the Ray Society.\r\n\r\nThere are many facts of extraordinary interest about these tiny swarming\r\ninsects. In the first place, they are closely related to the minute\r\nscale-insects or _Coccidæ_, several species of which produce the\r\ncelebrated lac of lacquer-work and the dyes known as lake, cochineal,\r\nand kermes, the latter a dye manufactured in South Europe and used to\r\ncolour wool and cloth crimson before cochineal reached us from Mexico.\r\nThe _Coccidæ_ include also the “mussel-scale” and other destructive\r\ndiseases of fruit trees. A beautiful purple colour can be extracted from\r\ncrushed masses of some kinds of aphides (as well as from _Coccidæ_), and\r\nhas been used as a dye. The aphides have very generally a green colour,\r\nlike many insects (caterpillars and leaf insects) which pass their lives\r\nupon green leaves and feed on them. It is often supposed that this green\r\ncolour is merely the green colouring matter (so-called chlorophyll) of\r\nthe leaf, taken up by the insects in feeding on the leaf. But this is\r\nnot so; it is a peculiar substance derived in a crude state from the\r\nplant-juice, but digested in the stomach and completed in the insects’\r\nblood and tissues. Then, again, the aphides produce curious secretions,\r\noften in great abundance, which surround them as the lac surrounds the\r\nlac-insect. The threads which are produced in such abundance, by the\r\nwoolly aphis of apple trees, as to look like masses of cotton wool\r\nadhering to the twigs of the tree, are of this nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.—Foundress or stock-mother of the hop-louse: the\r\nindividual hatched from a winter egg, laid on the bark of a plum tree,\r\nwho produces viviparously a wingless virgin brood. That brood produces\r\nwing-bearing young, which fly off to the hop-plants.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.—Side view of winged viviparous female of the\r\nhop-louse, _b_, the stabbing beak.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.—An ant “milking” a “plant-louse” or “green-fly”\r\nfor honey-dew. The drop of honey-dew is seen exuding from one of the two\r\nlong tubes or spouts (called “cornicles”) on the back of the plant-louse\r\nat _a_. These spouts are seen at the hinder part of the body in the\r\ndrawings of the hop-louse (Figs. 55 to 59). The ant is causing the aphis\r\nto pour out its honey-dew (in fact “milking” it) by “drumming” on the\r\nbody of the plant-louse with its clubbed antennæ, and has taken the drop\r\nof honey-dew between its jaws. This drawing was made from life by the\r\nlate Mr. Buckton, F.R.S., a great student of these creatures. The ant is\r\nthat kind known as _Myrinica rubra_. The plant-louse is the _Aphis\r\nsambuci_ or blight of the elder-tree.]\r\n\r\nAnother curious production of the aphides—common on the leaves of elms\r\nand other trees infested by them—is known as “honey-dew.” It is sticky\r\nand sweet, and was supposed by old writers to have distilled from the\r\nstars, or otherwise to have dropped from heaven. It is this sweet\r\nsecretion which has led to the establishment of a most curious\r\nfriendship between ants and aphides, or plant-lice. It has long been\r\nknown that an ant will approach an aphis, and tickle it, when at once\r\nthe aphis exudes from its cornicles (see Fig. 60) a drop of sweet\r\nhoney-dew, which the ant swallows—just as a man may milk a cow and\r\ndrink the milk. And the resemblance goes further, for the ants take\r\npossession of certain aphides, and keep them either underground or in\r\nspecially constructed chambers, where they can gain ready access to them\r\nand “milk” them for honey-dew. There has been a certain amount of\r\nexaggeration in the description of these facts by some of the older\r\nwriters; but it is undoubtedly true that some species of ants keep\r\nspecial flocks or herds of aphides, and feed on their sweet secretion.\r\n\r\nOther small insects nourish themselves on the enormous swarms of\r\nplant-lice in a less gentle way, but a way which man is very glad to see\r\nin active operation, namely, by biting them and sucking out their soft\r\nentrails—thus destroying them in great numbers. The lady-bird beetle is\r\nespecially active in this matter, both when it is a grub and on\r\nattaining its adult form. A trustworthy observer saw as many as forty\r\naphides consumed by a lady-bird in an hour. Where the plant-lice or\r\naphides abound, there come also in countless swarms the beetles known as\r\nlady-birds. In the year 1869, such a cloud of these beetles passed over\r\nand settled on the fields and gardens of Kent, Sussex, and Surrey, as to\r\ncause something like terror; it was impossible to walk in the lanes\r\nwithout crushing hundreds under foot. But the little lady-birds are not\r\nlike the terrible locust, which appears in millions and devours all\r\nvegetation before it; on the contrary, they are what are called\r\n“beneficials,” and come solely to feed on and destroy the plant-lice of\r\nthe hops, plum trees, and apple trees. A first-rate hop crop in the year\r\n1870 was the consequence of the abundance of lady-birds in 1869. It is\r\nthis beneficent activity of the lady-birds which has given them their\r\nname. In Italy they are called _Bestioline del Signore_, also\r\n_Madonnine_, and _Marioline_, and in France _Bête à Dieu_. In English\r\nthey are “our lady’s blessed bugs,” which save the crops from\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThe exertions of the aphides in pricking the plants they infest so as to\r\nget at their juices lead to the growth of galls on the leaves, and also\r\non the rootlets of many plants, and often the leaves become rolled up\r\ninto bag-like bodies filled with aphides. Many trees and smaller plants\r\nare killed by these attacks, but it is probable that where the plants\r\nhave not been rendered delicate by nursing and cultivation, and where\r\nthe aphides are not a strange foreign kind, introduced by man’s\r\ncarelessness or by some rarely (if ever) occurring wind or flood, the\r\naphides do not actually destroy any plants by their visitation,\r\nexcepting the weaklings, and that their numbers are kept within bounds\r\nby their natural enemies the lady-birds and other such carnivorous\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nWe must now notice the most interesting of all the wonderful things\r\nwhich have been discovered about these tiny insects, which are even\r\nsmaller than fleas. Any one who has a rose-garden and chooses to spend\r\nsome hours a day in studying the “green-fly” can follow out the facts.\r\nThey reproduce themselves—that is to say, propagate—with astounding\r\nrapidity. The great Linnæus, a hundred and fifty years ago, came to the\r\nconclusion, from his observation of one kind or species, that in one\r\nyear a single aphis would produce a quintillion of descendants! Without\r\ninsisting upon the exact numbers in different kinds of aphides, we may\r\nsay that that is a fair indication of the rate at which they produce\r\nyoung. No sooner does a mother aphis produce some thirty or forty young,\r\nthan in a few hours or days, according to the warmth of the season and\r\nthe abundance of food, these young have grown to full size and\r\nthemselves each produce the same number of young, and so on through the\r\nsummer, and even into the autumn. Nineteen generations in sixteen weeks\r\nhave been counted in some kinds of the plant-lice. Hence it is no wonder\r\nthat these little creatures increase exceedingly and cover the leaves\r\nand shoots on which they feed; no wonder that they furnish a plentiful\r\nnourishment for the lady-birds which prey on them. But the most curious\r\nthing is this, that these abundant and rapidly reproducing broods of\r\naphis are _all females_, and that they do not lay eggs, but extrude\r\ntheir young in a more or less complete state of development, that is to\r\nsay, they are viviparous. They are all females! It is only late in the\r\nseason that males are produced!\r\n\r\nIn fact, the summer broods of the “green-fly” and other aphides which do\r\nso much damage to rose bushes, hops, and other cultivated plants, are\r\nproduced by females alone, without the intervention of a male. These\r\nminute insects present true instances of that very remarkable and\r\ninteresting occurrence which is called “parthenogenesis,” or virginal\r\npropagation. It is further a noteworthy thing that the virginal aphis\r\nmothers do not lay or deposit eggs, but that the young grow from the\r\neggs inside their mothers (Fig. 61), and are only extruded when they are\r\ncomplete little six-legged insects, capable of walking, and ready to\r\nfeed themselves by stabbing the soft leaves of the plant on which they\r\nfind themselves, and sucking up its juices. The summer aphides are\r\nspoken of as being both “viviparous” and “parthenogenetic.” The words\r\nare really useful, and we cannot get on without them.\r\n\r\nNo case is known to medical men or to naturalists of the birth of young\r\nfrom an unimpregnated or virgin mother among what are called the higher\r\nanimals—those which are classed as vertebrates, and include mankind,\r\nmammals, birds, reptiles, batrachians, and fishes. But though uncommon,\r\nthis virginal reproduction (or “parthenogenesis”) does occur constantly\r\nin a very few kinds of small insects and in some small shrimp-like\r\ncreatures. It has excited the greatest interest amongst naturalists from\r\nthe early days when it was first observed until the present, and it has\r\nbeen very carefully studied in the past thirty years.\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate this matter it is necessary to know the chief\r\nfacts about the ordinary process of reproduction in animals and plants.\r\nAll animals and plants are built up of minute particles of living matter\r\ncalled “cells” (see p. 170). Really, these are not cells, or hollow\r\nboxes, or cases. We use the word “cell” for the contents of a cell. Each\r\nis a droplet of protoplasm or living matter lying in a small or large\r\nenvelope or case of dead matter which it has produced around itself\r\n(Fig. 61). Observers using their microscopes saw at first only the case,\r\nand called it a “cell,” and the word “cell” is now used almost\r\nuniversally for the soft stuff within the cell (see p. 173). Each soft\r\ncell of “plasm” or “protoplasm” has a very special structure. The\r\nexistence in it of a central kernel, or “nucleus” of peculiarly active\r\nsubstance, is the most obvious feature. These “cells” are so small (for\r\ninstance, those which build up the human body) that from one to two\r\nthousand could be placed side by side on a line an inch long. They are\r\nthe “units” which make up the body of an animal or plant, just as bricks\r\nand planks and rods make up a building constructed by human contrivance.\r\nTwo most important things about them are—first, that each is always the\r\nseat of chemical activity, absorbing liquid material, changing it and\r\neither fixing it or throwing it out in a new chemical condition; and,\r\nsecond, that as a result each cell grows, and after a very little growth\r\ndivides into two. This “dividing into two” is immensely important, for\r\nin this way the number of cells forming a very young or small animal or\r\nplant is increased from a few thousands to many millions whilst the\r\norganism grows. And not only that, but we find on tracing the young\r\nanimal or plant back to its beginning as an individual that it actually\r\nstarted as a single cell. The germ of every living thing, then, is a\r\nsingle nucleated particle of protoplasm—a cell which we call the\r\n“egg-cell,” because “eggs” are merely shells and packing to hold and\r\nprotect this all-important egg-cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.—A single egg-tube or ovarian tube (usually\r\nthere are many) of an insect. The youngest and smallest eggs are at the\r\nnarrow end. _o_ _o_ are larger egg-cells with a striated shell or\r\nenvelope; _g_, nucleus of the egg-cell. The unshaded egg is one grown to\r\nfull size, and in the parthenogenetic aphis would develop where it is\r\nwithout fertilisation into a young aphis.]\r\n\r\nEvery individual flower, tree, insect, snail, fish, and man started as a\r\nsingle egg-cell, which became detached from the mother’s body. Take the\r\ncase of a common marine animal, the star-fish. At the breeding season,\r\nearly in the year, the female star-fish discharges thousands of these\r\negg-cells into the sea-water. Each floats separately in a delicate case\r\nof its own. Before any one of those floating egg-cells can commence to\r\ndivide so as to build up a new mass of cells—a new young star-fish—it\r\nmust undergo the process of “fertilisation.” That is to say, its\r\nsubstance must fuse with that of a “sperm-cell.” These “sperm-cells” are\r\ndischarged into the sea-water in countless thousands by the male\r\nstar-fishes. They are excessively minute, actively wriggling threads,\r\nswollen out at one end to form a little knob, the “nucleus” of the\r\nsperm-cell (see p. 134 for figures of the spermatozoa, and eggs of the\r\noyster). The water is rendered cloudy by the abundance of these\r\nmicroscopic filaments, which are called “spermatozoa.” One sperm-cell,\r\nor spermatozoon comes into contact, in the sea-water, with each of the\r\ndischarged floating egg-cells. It burrows into it and fuses or melts\r\nand mixes with the substance of the egg-cell. The whole process is easy\r\nto watch with a microscope, and I am writing of what I, in common with\r\nmany others, have actually seen.\r\n\r\nThe egg-cell after this process consists really of the substance of two\r\nequal cells—the egg-cell and the sperm-cell—completely fused so as to\r\nform a single cell, having a single “nucleus,” which has resulted from\r\nthe fusion of the nucleus of the egg-cell with that of the sperm-cell.\r\nNow, and not before, the egg-cell can divide, take up nourishment, and\r\ncontinue to divide and grow, so as to form a constantly increasing mass\r\nof young cells, a young animal which gradually assumes the form of a\r\nstar-fish. All animals, and plants, too, reproduce themselves in this\r\nway. When the animal or plant is not aquatic in its habits the\r\nsperm-cell and the egg-cell cannot be discharged and take their chance\r\nof coming into contact with one another outside the parent’s body; the\r\nsperm-cells are, in such cases, received into a chamber of the\r\negg-producing parent’s body, and there the fusion of the egg-cells with\r\nthem, one sperm-cell to one egg-cell, takes place. Parthenogenesis then\r\nconsists in the omission of the fusion of a sperm-cell with the\r\negg-cell. The egg-cell develops, divides again and again, and produces\r\nthe young animal without the addition to it of a sperm-cell—without, in\r\nfact, being “fertilised,” as it is called. That is what happens in the\r\nsummer broods of the little plant-lice or aphides (Fig. 57). When,\r\nhowever, the cold weather comes the virgin mothers suddenly produce two\r\nkinds of young—males as well as females—and then the solitary winter\r\negg, which the late autumn females lay to last through winter until\r\nspring, is fertilised by a sperm-cell derived from the late produced\r\nautumn male (Fig. 56) in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nAnother parthenogenetic animal is the rare little fresh-water shrimp\r\ncalled _Apus_, which goes on multiplying in this manner in wayside ponds\r\nfor years, thousands of female individuals being produced in successive\r\nseasons, laying their eggs and carrying on the race for an indefinite\r\ntime until at last—one fine day—we do not know why then and not\r\nbefore, that rare creature a male _Apus_ is hatched. Why these and one\r\nor two other such small shrimps and insects are able to set aside the\r\nalmost universal law as to the necessity for fertilisation of the\r\negg-cell by a sperm-cell, naturalists have not yet found out. It is\r\nquite certain that these exceptional creatures have been derived from\r\nancestors which had their eggs fertilised in the regular way, and that\r\nthis elimination of the male is a special device, an innovation.\r\n\r\nThere are incomplete attempts at it in other insects. Thus it has been\r\ndiscovered that the queen bee produces only females from the eggs which\r\nare fertilised before she lays them. When the stock of sperm-cells which\r\nshe received from a drone in her nuptial flight is exhausted, or if we\r\ncarefully remove by a painless operation the internal sac in which they\r\nare stored, the eggs are no longer fertilised, but they are not rendered\r\nsterile or abortive. They develop into drones! And drones or male bees\r\nare produced in no other way, and only drones are so produced, never\r\nworker-females (so-called neuters) nor queens.\r\n\r\nAnother curious fact is that in rearing moths in captivity some\r\nnaturalists have quite unexpectedly found that when they have hatched\r\nout female moths from the chrysalids and kept them from the moment of\r\nhatching quite apart from the male moths (which are of another size and\r\ncolour, and easily distinguished), these females will sometimes lay\r\neggs—unfertilised eggs—which give birth to caterpillars, which feed\r\nand complete all their changes. The second generation of moths so\r\nproduced are male and female, but the females, being kept apart again,\r\nproduce a parthenogenetic brood, and the process has been repeated to a\r\nthird generation. These instances are very rare. The remarkable thing\r\nabout them is that, apparently, the parthenogenesis is only due to the\r\nexperimental interference of an entomologist, and that unless some such\r\naccident had befallen the moths, the eggs would have been fertilised in\r\nthe usual way, since there was no deficiency of male moths. These facts\r\nhave led to many interesting speculations, and are particularly curious\r\nin regard to the inquiry as to what determines the sex of offspring,\r\nabout which sensational announcements are sometimes made in the foreign\r\ncorrespondence columns of our newspapers. Here we find the\r\nparthenogenetic eggs of the moths producing both males and females,\r\nthose of the aphides and the pond-shrimp producing predominantly\r\nfemales, and those of the queen bee producing exclusively males\r\n(drones). Biologists have not yet arrived at a solution of the problem\r\nraised by these divergent results.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, in regard to this subject, to remember that many lower\r\nanimals and plants can reproduce or propagate by separating “buds,” or\r\nlarge bits of their bodies, built up of thousands of cells, and,\r\ntherefore, not to be confused with the single egg-cell. The egg-cell is\r\na cell specially prepared for fusion with a sperm-cell,\r\nnecessitating—except in very rare instances—the union in the new\r\nindividual or young of living material from two separate parental\r\norganisms, and, therefore, in many cases, from two widely separate lines\r\nof ancestry. A snippet, or bit cut from a begonia leaf, will produce a\r\nnew individual plant; a bit cut or torn from a polyp will similarly give\r\nrise to a new individual: but the parthenogenetic egg is not to be\r\nconfused with these masses of cells. It is a true egg-cell which might\r\nhave been fertilised, and it is found in animals such as insects and\r\ncrustaceans, which are more highly elaborated in structure than any\r\nwhich, like the polyps and zoophytes, multiply by buds and cuttings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE DEADLY PHYLLOXERA\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was only after long and patient investigation that the various broods\r\nof the terrible Phylloxera which, between 1868 and 1888, destroyed half\r\nthe vineyards of France, became known, their relations to one another\r\ndetermined, and the final cure for the devastation caused by them\r\ndecided upon and put into practice.\r\n\r\nIn all ordinary plant-lice or green-fly (aphides) at the end of the\r\nsummer, the last parthenogenetic brood produces a generation of distinct\r\nmales and females, which differ a good deal in appearance from the\r\nvirginal broods of the spring and summer. Each female, after receiving\r\nsperm-cells from a male, lays a single egg, which consists of a\r\nfertilised egg-cell enclosed in an egg-shell. It is deposited in a safe\r\nplace in a crack of the bark of a tree, or on the rootlets of some\r\nplant, and remains unchanged through the winter. In the spring from\r\nevery such egg hatches a single female aphis, which feeds and increases\r\nin size. In a very short time (a week or so) this solitary female (Fig.\r\n58) proceeds to produce, without male intervention, young which grow\r\nfrom true egg-cells which are not laid but remain inside her. The young\r\nare born or pass out of her as small six-legged insects. They feed and\r\ngrow up, and in turn produce “parthenogenetically” and viviparously\r\nbroods of young like themselves. The first female thus hatched from the\r\nwinter egg is called a “foundress,” or “stock-mother,” because she\r\nstarts a whole colony of young which, by virginal propagation of\r\nsuccessive broods, may number many millions in a season. These are known\r\nas “virgin-mothers” (Fig. 57), and eventually their later generations\r\nalways produce males and females, so that we distinguish, in the course\r\nof a year, four sets of aphides, starting from the egg, namely (1) the\r\nfoundresses, (2) the numerous generations of virgin-mothers, (3) the\r\nmales, and (4) the egg-laying females.\r\n\r\nIn different kinds of plant-lice any of these “sets” may be either\r\nwinged or wingless (Figs. 55, 56, 59); many generations of the\r\nvirgin-mothers are wingless, but not all, in all species. According to\r\nthe species or kind of aphis and its requirements in regard to the\r\nplants on which it feeds, wings are developed so as to enable the aphis\r\nto fly from one tree or locality to another, or are not developed if the\r\naphis has to remain where it was born. The whole series of successive\r\nbroods of some kinds of aphis remain on one plant and about the same\r\npart of it, and then there is little need for wings. Others have their\r\nsummer broods on the twigs or leaves, but the later broods descend in\r\nwinter to the roots of the same plant. The woolly aphis of the apple\r\ntrees and pear trees behaves in this way; other species again produce a\r\nlate-winged brood, which leaves the plant on which its parents were\r\nfeeding, and travels some distance to the twigs or to the roots of a\r\nquite distinct kind of plant to produce an autumn brood, and from these\r\nthe final males and females are born, and the winter eggs are then\r\ndeposited. The hop-louse leaves the hop when the hop-vine dies down in\r\nautumn. The abundant wingless form (Fig. 58) of which there have usually\r\nbeen ten generations, produces at last a winged “migrant” brood (Fig.\r\n59) which flies away to plum trees and sloe bushes, perhaps a quarter of\r\na mile distant. There the migrants produce wingless females on the plum\r\ntree. They are followed to the plum trees by a final migrant brood from\r\nthe dying hops which are males—the first yet seen (Fig. 56). The males\r\nfertilise the wingless females born on the plum tree—and the latter lay\r\neach one fertilised egg in the crevices of the bark of the plum tree\r\nnear the young buds. Winter now sets in: all are dead except the eggs.\r\nIn the following late spring a foundress hatches out from each egg so\r\ndeposited. The “foundress” (Fig. 58) in this species, the hop aphis, is\r\nwingless. She produces parthenogenetically and viviparously a brood of\r\nwingless females. They similarly produce on the plum tree a third\r\ngeneration of virgin females, but these have wings! (Fig. 55). They fly\r\nback to the hop-vines, which are now well risen from the ground and\r\noffer abundant juice to the wingless virgin brood which escapes from the\r\nwinged migrants as soon as they have settled on the hop, and feed and\r\ngrow and produce new wingless broods (Fig. 57) in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nThe phylloxera of the vine is a plant-louse or aphis, which exhibits an\r\ninteresting adaptation of winged and wingless broods to the requirements\r\nof the insect’s nutrition and multiplication. A “foundress” hatches from\r\nan egg on the bark of the vine where it has passed the winter. It\r\nproceeds to attack the young leaves and to produce a brood of young. The\r\nleaves of the vine when thus attacked swell up and produce galls, in\r\nwhich the young phylloxera are enclosed, and there the phylloxeras\r\ncontinue to multiply, producing more galls and thus destroying the\r\nleaves. Some of the young broods now crawl down the vine to its roots;\r\nothers stay on the leaves and continue their destructive work there.\r\nThere are several varieties of form and size amongst these broods. Those\r\nwhich go to the roots attack the rootlets and produce knobs and\r\nswellings on them, leading to their destruction as feeding organs.\r\nMeanwhile the root-phylloxeras multiply exceedingly, and those on the\r\nleaves are still feeding and multiplying. From one foundress mother as\r\nmany as twenty-five millions are produced in six months. At last in the\r\nautumn the root-parasites produce a winged generation of virgin-mothers,\r\nwhich come up from the ground and fly away to other vines, upon which\r\nthey produce males and females. These females each lay a fertilised egg\r\non the bark of the previously healthy vine, and so the infection is\r\nspread. The root-infesting forms continue to multiply, and in warm\r\nclimates there is no cessation of this process even in winter.\r\n\r\nThis parasite—the _Phylloxera vastatrix_—was introduced with some\r\nAmerican species of grape-vine—brought over as experimental samples\r\nfrom Colorado—about 1864. In its native country it does comparatively\r\nlittle harm, for the roots of the American species of vine are, though\r\nattacked by it, not seriously injured. They have the property of\r\nthrowing out new rootlets when those already existing are punctured and\r\ninjured by the phylloxera, and so are not killed by the attack, as is\r\nthe European grape-vine.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of this deadly parasite to Europe was a mere chance,\r\ndue to ignorance and stupid want of supervision of importations on the\r\npart of the Government, such as is common in this country, though less\r\nso in France and Germany—part of the blind mixing-up of the nicely\r\nadjusted products of all parts of the earth which civilised man is\r\nalways bringing about with disastrous and terrifying results. In twenty\r\nyears France lost 400 million pounds in consequence; three million acres\r\nof vineyards were destroyed. Other countries—Germany, Italy, and the\r\nCape—also suffered. All sorts of remedies were suggested and tried,\r\nsuch as the application of poisons to the roots and the sinking of the\r\nvineyards under water. Gradually the only effective method of dealing\r\nwith the case has been established. The old European vine-stocks or\r\nstandards have been grubbed up in all but the very choicest vineyards,\r\nand American vines have been planted in their place. On to these have\r\nbeen grafted cuttings of the local French vines, and they have taken\r\nkindly to their new conditions. The produce of the French vineyards is\r\nnow greater than it has ever been. It had fallen from an annual yield of\r\n1,300,000,000 gallons to 650,000,000—but in 1900 it had risen again to\r\na yield of more than 1,400,000,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nThis history is a striking instance of the vast importance to civilised\r\ncommunities of a knowledge and control of even such minute living things\r\nas the plant-lice, and of the extraordinarily large results which\r\nobscure living things may produce. It must tend to convince reasonable\r\nmen of the importance of accurate knowledge as to living things and of\r\nthe necessity of expending public money in constantly improving and\r\nextending that knowledge.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious illustration of the enormous fecundity of the plant-lice\r\noccurs to me as worth giving in conclusion. The late Professor Huxley—a\r\ncareful and trustworthy authority—calculated that the produce of a\r\nsingle aphis would, in the course of ten generations, supposing all the\r\nindividuals to survive, “contain more ponderable substance than five\r\nhundred millions of stout men; that is, more than the whole population\r\nof China.” And this calculation is held by some authorities to be below\r\nrather than above the mark!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\n\r\nCLOTHES MOTHS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way in which the lives of all animals and plants are interwoven with\r\nthat of other animals and plants, often in obscure and unsuspected ways,\r\ncomes home to man when he contemplates the numbers and variety of living\r\nthings which exist with him and upon him—that is to say, at his expense\r\nand to the detriment of the stores which he accumulates, the clothing\r\nwith which he covers himself, and the buildings which he constructs. Man\r\nnot only has carefully taken a number of animals and plants in hand and\r\ncultivated them as food-givers, as sources of clothing, and other useful\r\nmaterial, but, much to his annoyance, he finds, per contra, that other\r\nanimals (and plants, too), with similar self-seeking habit, make use of\r\nhim in his turn, and of his belongings, with a complete disregard of his\r\nconvenience, treating him and his arrangements as so much available\r\n“food-stuff,” and showing no atom of respect to him as the lord of\r\ncreation. Just as in dealing with the more deadly attacks of\r\ndisease-producing parasites, so in meeting the destructive invasions\r\nmade by his fellow-creatures of all sizes and kinds in search of food\r\nand shelter—man has to be continually on the alert, and to wage a\r\nconstant warfare, unless he will consent to see himself and his\r\npossessions moth-eaten, fly-blown, worm-burrowed, reduced to fragments\r\nand powder. And this warfare he has incessantly carried on with\r\nincreasing skill and knowledge from the earliest times of which we have\r\nany record.\r\n\r\nThe sparrow and the rat, of which there has lately been much talk, are\r\nexamples of fairly large, easily detected enemies of this kind. The\r\nalmost ultra-microscopic bacteria—similar to those which produce\r\ndisease by multiplying in the living body—are examples of the most\r\nminute living pests which injure man by causing sourness, putrefaction,\r\nand destructive rot in his food and stores. Every year civilised man is\r\ngaining greater knowledge of these “ferment organisms,” and vastly\r\nincreased skill in preserving his possessions, such as food and drink,\r\nfrom the attacks of their ubiquitous swarms. Between the larger\r\ndepredators, such as birds and rats, and the smallest, such as the\r\nmicroscopic bacteria and moulds (to whom alone putrefaction is due, and\r\nwithout whom it would never occur), there are a host of small\r\ntroublesome creatures, which belong chiefly to the group of animals\r\ncalled “insects”—beetles, moths, flies, and bugs—which give man\r\nincessant occupation in warding off their attacks upon his food, his\r\nclothes, his furniture, his buildings, his crops and fruit trees, and\r\nhis domesticated animals. The study of these things and of the means of\r\ngrappling with them is the fascinating occupation of those who are\r\ncalled “economic” zoologists and botanists. Of course, in order to carry\r\non their inquiries successfully they have to bring to bear on the\r\nquestions they investigate as complete and thorough a knowledge as\r\npossible of all the kinds of animals and plants, and of their ways of\r\nfeeding, reproducing, and protecting themselves in natural conditions.\r\n\r\nOne of the most widely celebrated and anciently detested of insect pests\r\nis the clothes moth. It is the caterpillar of this moth which is\r\nobjectionable—biting off, eating, and using to weave a case the hair of\r\nfurs and the fine filaments of woollen fabrics. Not every one is able to\r\nrecognise the clothes moth, which is a very small creature of a\r\ngreyish-yellow colour. The wings when set for flying measure only half\r\nan inch in expanse, and when the moth is walking or at rest, shut\r\nclosely to the body so as to give it an almost cylindrical shape, with\r\nan attenuated snout. Much bigger moths occasionally get into our rooms,\r\nbut do no harm. These little clothes moths lay their eggs on fur or\r\nwool, and the caterpillars which hatch from them do the damage. The\r\nmoths themselves have no jaws and take no food. But the caterpillar or\r\ngrub, though soft and readily crushed, has a pair of very hard, minute,\r\ndark-coloured jaws, with which it works away, cropping the fur and wool\r\non which it lives. The moths are seen in houses commonly between January\r\nand October, and it is, of course, the object of the victimised\r\nhouseholder to destroy them before they can lay eggs, or, what is more\r\npractical, to keep woollen and fur clothes away from their reach. Things\r\nwhich are in daily use are not very liable to receive a deposit of eggs\r\nfrom the clothes moth, and as a rule the enemy may be kept at bay by\r\ndaily shaking and beating the things in question, and hanging them up in\r\nthe air. But coats, flannels, etc., which are hidden away, left quietly\r\nin drawers or cupboards, offer the undisturbed conditions which the\r\nclothes moth seeks. There is no safety for them unless they are wrapped\r\nup or shut in with a quantity of naphtol or of camphor, or, as is\r\nnowadays more usual, placed in a refrigerating chamber.\r\n\r\nThe little caterpillar which does all the damage is of a dull white\r\ncolour, with a reddish head. It is remarkable for the fact that it makes\r\na sort of movable tunic or case for itself out of the hair or wool which\r\nit crops, and it crawls about protected by this case. There are not\r\nmany insects which thus construct portable cases for themselves when in\r\nthe grub or caterpillar state of life. Such “cases” must not be confused\r\nwith the very similar “cocoons” by which some moth-grubs surround\r\nthemselves (as, for instance, the silkworm moth) when their growth is\r\ncompleted, and they become quiescent and hard, and are known as\r\nchrysalids. Such “cocoons” are constructed in the same way as the lining\r\nof the clothes moth’s case, by threads of silk secreted by the\r\ncaterpillar, but they are made once for all when the grub has ceased\r\nactivity. The little clothes moth caterpillar, on the other hand, has\r\ncontinually to enlarge its tunic or case as it itself increases in size.\r\nThere is a hole at the end, from which the head and three legs of the\r\ncaterpillar emerge, so that it can crawl and feed freely. The outer\r\nsurface of the case consists of cut lengths of the fibre on which the\r\ngrub is living, and so is protective in resembling the surrounding\r\nmaterial and hiding the minute ravager. It is easy enough for the little\r\ngrub to add a bit to the case at the end from which its head protrudes,\r\nand, being very flexible, it can turn right round in the tube and put\r\nits head out at the other end and secrete a bit more there, cementing\r\ncut hairs to the outer surface. But in order to increase the breadth of\r\nthe tube or case, the caterpillar has, from time to time, to undertake a\r\nformidable operation. It actually slits up the case lengthwise for about\r\nhalf its extent, and fills in the gaping space with new material; then\r\nit cuts up the opposite face of the same half of the tube, and puts in a\r\nnew patch there. And after that, it has to treat the remaining half of\r\nthe tube in the same way, making two more cuts, one opposite the other,\r\nand filling in the gap in each case as before. Students of these little\r\ncreatures have amused themselves by changing the position of the\r\ncaterpillar and its case, from fur or wool of one colour to fur or wool\r\nof another colour, and in this way the industrious caterpillar is made\r\nto work in different coloured fibre in successive enlargements of his\r\ncase, so that it becomes a Joseph’s coat of many colours.\r\n\r\nAn interesting fact about the movable case made by the clothes moth\r\ncaterpillar is that the nearest thing in nature to it is the case made\r\nby the aquatic grubs or caterpillars of another kind of insects—the\r\ncaddis-worms (“case-worms”) which are common in ponds and streams. They\r\nshow extraordinary powers in making their cases so that they balance\r\nnicely in the water, as the animal crawls along on the bottom of a pool,\r\nwith his head and six legs emerging from one end of the case.\r\nCaddis-worms are of various kinds or species, and some attach to their\r\ncases little broken sticks, others minute empty snail-shells, others the\r\nfine green threads of water-plants. The caddis-worm becomes changed into\r\na delicate fly, with transparent wings, just as the clothes-grub becomes\r\nchanged into a moth—and it is an interesting fact that the\r\ncaddis-flies, though they are classed with the May-flies and such\r\nnet-winged insects, and not with the moths and butterflies (the\r\n_Lepidoptera_, or insects with wings covered with dust-like scales,\r\nwhich give the colour and patterns to the wings), yet agree with moths\r\nin having some scales on the wings and with one kind of minute moth,\r\nnamely, the clothes moth, in having grubs which make movable cases.\r\n\r\nThe clothes moth caterpillar was known to the Romans by the name\r\n_Tinea_, and is described with correct detail by the Roman naturalist\r\nPliny. Modern naturalists have accepted this name _Tinea_ as that of the\r\ngenus to which the clothes moth belongs. There are thirty different\r\nBritish species of _Tinea_, of which four are guilty of attacking animal\r\nfabric, and so causing trouble to man. The one which builds a case and\r\nis the titular chief of the clan of clothes moths—“the” clothes moth,\r\njust as one may say “the” Macintosh—is scientifically indicated by the\r\nname _Tinea pellionella_. The other three do not form movable cases when\r\nin the caterpillar stage, and attack coarser stuff than fur and fine\r\nwool. One of them is known as the “tapestry moth,” because its\r\ncaterpillar establishes itself in old tapestry and carpets, and\r\nburrowing into these thickish materials is concealed without the aid of\r\nany self-provided tunic or case. The name _Tinea_ is often used by\r\nentomologists in an expanded form as _Tineina_, to indicate the whole\r\nseries of minute moths of which the genus _Tinea_ is only one little\r\ngroup. Many of these moths are much smaller even than the clothes moth,\r\nand they are found in all parts of the world and in all sorts and\r\nconditions of life—in relation to trees, shrubs, and plants of all\r\nkinds. It has been estimated that there are as many as 200,000\r\ndistinctly marked different kinds of these minute creatures. The insect\r\ncollectors and students who occupy themselves with the magnificent\r\nbutterflies and larger moths (of which there are an enormous variety of\r\nkinds) refuse to deal with the somewhat dull-looking and almost\r\ninnumerable minute moths which are classed as _Micro-lepidoptera_, in\r\ncontrast to the _Macro-lepidoptera_ (or big moths and butterflies).\r\nConsequently they have become the favourite study of a few enthusiasts,\r\nwho are known as Micro-lepidopterists, and have a wide but not\r\nuninteresting field of exploration all to themselves. The\r\n_Micro-lepidoptera_ include, besides the _Tineina_, a group of less\r\nminute though small moths, with narrow, fringed wings, amongst which are\r\nthe window moth, the milk moth, the tabby moth, the meal moth, and the\r\ngrease moth. Though the clothes moths may well be described as “tiny”\r\nmoths, yet the word _Tinea_, as applied to them, has no such origin, but\r\nis the name given to the destructive grub by the Romans. The same word\r\nhas unfortunately been applied by medical men and botanists to a\r\nvegetable parasite which causes a skin disease (ringworm) resulting in\r\nbaldness. The _Tinea calvans_ of the doctors has only this in common\r\nwith the moth _Tinea pellionella_—that it causes hair to disappear and\r\nbaldness to ensue; but the vegetable parasite attacks the hair on a\r\nliving man’s head, the caterpillar that on his fur coat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\n\r\nSTONE AND WOOD BORERS\r\n\r\n\r\nBoring into wood is a favourite proceeding on the part of many small\r\ncreatures, insects, shrimps, and ship-worms, by which they not only\r\nacquire nourishment, but at the same time penetrate more and more deeply\r\ninto safe quarters and concealment. It is not surprising that it has\r\nbecome the necessary and regular mode of life of a host of small\r\nanimals, and consequently that man who wants wood in good sound blocks\r\nand planks for his various constructions is a good deal put out by the\r\nvoracity of the wood-boring community. To some extent he has given up\r\nthe task of checking their proceedings, and now uses metal where he\r\nformerly used wood, but that only applies to a limited field. Wood is\r\nstill the great material of rough construction, and the main substance\r\nused in fittings and furniture.\r\n\r\nIn our own country and in most parts of the world there are large grubs\r\nor caterpillars, such as those of the goat moth, three inches long and\r\nas thick as one’s finger, which eat into the stems of trees and spoil\r\nthe timber. The grub of the handsome moth known as the wood leopard is\r\nanother of these. It attacks poplar trees, and we used to take it in\r\nnumbers in the London parks and squares when I was a collector. The goat\r\nmoth is specially destructive to willow trees. But there are a very\r\nlarge series of smaller grubs and adult insects which injure trees or\r\nbore or devour wood already cut and dried. Among these are the saw-flies\r\nand a number of beetles, and in Sicily and the tropics there are the\r\nwonderful white ants which are not ants at all, but more like May-flies.\r\nThe destruction caused by these borers and eaters of wood is increased\r\nby the fact that when they have riddled a piece of wood, moisture\r\npenetrates it, and vegetable “moulds” flourish within it and complete\r\nthe break-up. Among the most destructive borers of wood are those which\r\nattack the ships and piers of wood placed by man in the sea. These are\r\ncertain shell-fish, called ship-worms (_Teredo_), which are really\r\npeculiarly modified mussels. There is also a tiny shrimp-like creature,\r\nthe _Limnoria terebrans_, which does enormous damage by its borings to\r\npiers of wood erected in the sea. True insects do not flourish in the\r\nsea. There are marine bivalve shell-fish which bore into clay,\r\nsandstone, chalk, and even into hard granite-like rock. They do not use\r\njaws or teeth for this purpose, but the surface of their shells, which\r\nare sharp and spiny, and also the sand which adheres to their soft\r\nmuscular bodies like emery powder to the pewter-plate of a lapidary’s\r\nwheel. You may see the large and small holes made by _Pholas_ (called\r\nalso “the piddock”) and other bivalve shell-fish in the clay and chalk\r\nrocks of the seashore on most parts of the English coast.\r\n\r\nMost boring animals swallow the material which they excavate in the act\r\nof boring, just as the earth-worm swallows the soil into which it bores,\r\nand as many sand-worms do, throwing out from the hind end of the body,\r\nin the form of a little coiled-up heap, a vast quantity of undigested\r\nmatter which has passed through them. But many insects which swallow\r\nsome of the material disengaged by their jaws remove, in addition, a\r\nlarge quantity which is ejected from the boring as powder, like\r\nsawdust, and others do not swallow any of the material into which they\r\nbore. So, too, the _Pholas_ and marine-boring mussels do not swallow the\r\nmaterial which they loosen. It is a very slow process, the boring in\r\nrock, and the fine particles rubbed away by incessant movement are\r\ncarried off in the sea-water.\r\n\r\nTo some extent the marine creatures which bore in rocks seem to be\r\nhelped by chemical action, since they show a preference for chalk and\r\nlimestone, easily dissolved by weak acid secreted by the borer, though,\r\nclearly enough, they are not dependent on such chemical aid since we\r\nfind them also boring in insoluble granite rock and shale and clay.\r\nThere is one true worm-borer which perforates hard limestone pebbles and\r\nchalk rocks, so as to give them the appearance which we call\r\n“worm-eaten” when caused by another sort of worm and observed in a very\r\ndifferent material, namely, old furniture and woodwork. At Tenby, in\r\nSouth Wales, the limestone pebbles on the beach are quite commonly\r\nriddled with these worm-holes, truly “worm-eaten.” When they are not too\r\nabundant one can see that the holes are arranged in pairs like a figure\r\n8, about half the size here printed. On splitting the rock or stone one\r\nfinds a deeply-running U-shaped double tube excavated in the stone. In\r\nthis the little worm lived. It is easiest to get at the worms in a fresh\r\nand living state on a coast where there are chalk-rocks and sea-washed\r\nlumps of chalk. The chalk is easy to split and cut at low tide, and then\r\nthe little key-hole apertures can be broken across and the soft red worm\r\nextracted. It is a beautiful red-blooded little worm—little more than\r\nhalf an inch long—with two tactile horns on its head and little\r\nbristles and gills on the rings of its annulated body. It is a true\r\n“worm,” like the earth-worm, what naturalists call by the not\r\ndispleasing name an “annelid.” It seems at first sight impossible that\r\nthis delicate little thing should “worm-eat” the hardest limestone. It\r\nhas no jaws, but one of the rings or segments of the front part of the\r\nbody has two of its bristles swollen to relatively gigantic size, hard\r\nand black. These are its boring organs, but I have no doubt that it is\r\nhelped, especially in its young state when commencing to bore, by an\r\nacid secretion from the surface of the body.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, in the strict sense of the word “worm,” the boring of\r\nchalk and stones by the little marine creature just mentioned (whose\r\nname is _Polydora_) is the only instance of a “worm-eaten” condition\r\nbeing produced by a real worm. The worm-eaten condition of wood is\r\nproduced either by the grub of a minute beetle (which is not in the\r\nstrict sense a “worm”) or by an ingenious human maker of “antiques” who\r\nimitates the little holes on the surface of the woodwork of old\r\nfurniture, so as to pass off clever reproductions for really ancient\r\ncabinet work. The little holes to imitate those of the true insect\r\nfurniture-borer are sometimes produced by discharging a gun loaded with\r\nfine shot at the piece of furniture which is to be passed off as\r\nancient. But knowing purchasers probe the holes so made with a carpet\r\nneedle, and discover the lead-shot sunk in the wood. Hence there has\r\narisen a profession of specially-skilled “worm-eaters,” who, by careful\r\nboring, imitate the holes made by insect grubs.\r\n\r\nAnd now we come at last to the actual, real furniture worm or grub. It\r\nis the grub of a small beetle—the _Anobium domesticum_, scarcely\r\none-fifth of an inch long (Fig. 62_c_), greyish-brown in colour, of a\r\ncylindrical shape, with the head completely concealed or overhung by the\r\nnext division of the body, the thorax. The grubs are longer, soft, pale,\r\nand fleshy. The sign of the presence of the _Anobium_ in your furniture\r\nis the existence of small circular holes here and there on the surface\r\nof the wood, with occasionally a little heap of yellow dust on the\r\nground beneath them. This last sign is in fact the only proof you can\r\nhave that the holes are not ancient and the burrows deserted, and that\r\nthe enemy is still alive and at work. Rarely, if ever, can you see\r\neither the grub or the completed beetle into which it changes after\r\nforming a cocoon within the burrows, for they very seldom leave their\r\nexcavations. But if you break up the wood you will find a surprising\r\nnumber of long, cylindrical passages, running side by side, and for many\r\ninches, through the deeper part of the wood, so that it may be quite\r\nrotten and ready to crumble, although presenting an uninjured surface\r\nsave for the little round holes here and there. In these passages you\r\nwill find both the grubs and the adult beetles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.—_a_, the death-watch beetle (_Xestobium\r\ntessellatum_) of the natural size (one-third of an inch long); _b_, the\r\nsame beetle enlarged; _c_, the beetle (_Anobium domesticum_) whose grub\r\nis the furniture-worm, of the natural size, a side view.]\r\n\r\nA closely-allied and somewhat smaller species of _Anobium_ common in\r\nhouses is of a more voracious character, not confining itself to dry\r\nwood, but eating bread, biscuits, rhubarb, ginger, and even cayenne\r\npepper. This second kind, called _Anobium paniceum_, is the real\r\n“book-worm”; it gets into old libraries, and the grubs bore their\r\ncylindrical tunnels from cover to cover of the undisturbed volumes. In a\r\npublic library twenty-seven folio volumes standing side by side were\r\nperforated in a straight line by one individual _Anobium_ grub or\r\nbook-worm, and so regular was the tunnel thus eaten out that a string\r\ncould be passed through the whole length of it, and the entire set of\r\ntwenty-seven volumes lifted up at once by it.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two other grubs which less commonly injure books, and\r\npass as “book-worms.” But the most notable of the insect enemies of\r\nbooks and papers is a curious little wingless insect which never passes\r\nthrough a grub stage of existence, but hatches out in the complete form\r\nof his parents. He is about a third of an inch long, has the shape of an\r\nelongated kite, with a long tail and six legs, and is called by old\r\nwriters “the silver-fish,” and by entomologists _Lepisma_ (Fig. 63).\r\nThis little pest does not burrow, but nibbles, and has destroyed many a\r\nvaluable old document and ancient book. Paste and sugar are a great\r\nattraction to him, and he will destroy a boxful of printed labels or a\r\nvaluable manuscript, leaving only the ink-marked parts untouched, but\r\nready to crumble.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the book-worm beetle, _Anobium_, is a larger beetle,\r\ncalled _Xestobium tessellatum_ (Fig. 62 _a_) which infests old woodwork,\r\nits grubs making correspondingly larger tunnels. The entire woodwork of\r\na house has had to be removed and replaced in consequence of this\r\ncreature’s depredation, and such pieces of furniture as a four-post\r\nbedstead have been riddled and made rotten in two or three years by its\r\nburrowing. It is still common in England in old wood-panelled rooms and\r\nin wooden mantelpieces. The most interesting fact about it is that it is\r\nthe maker of those nocturnal tappings which are known as the\r\n“death-watch.” It is the beetle itself (Fig. 62 _a_), not the grub,\r\nwhich makes these sounds. It makes them by deliberately striking the\r\nwood on which it stands, with its head. The taps are usually from five\r\nto seven in quick succession, the sound dying away in intensity in the\r\nlater strokes. A second, and even a third, beetle will then reply with\r\nsimilar taps from the woodwork of some other part of the room. Years\r\nago I used to be gently lulled to sleep by these “raps” in my rooms at\r\nOxford, accompanied by the sound of spasmodic rushes of mice behind the\r\nwoodwork. At first I thought the tapping was caused by the falling of\r\ndrops of water through a leaky roof, but soon ascertained the actual\r\ncause. One does not notice these tappings until the dead of night when\r\nall else is still, and they are so mysterious and persistent that one\r\ncan understand superstition arising in connection with them, and that\r\nthe nerves of any one already overwrought, might be so affected by them\r\nas to lead to the belief that evil spirits are “rapping,” or that a\r\nghostly coffin is being nailed together for a dying man. The little\r\nbeetle has often been tracked by a naturalist, and discovered in some\r\nconcealed position nodding its diminutive but hard head with sharp\r\njerks, and producing an almost incredible volume of sound in proportion\r\nto its size. If the beetle, when discovered, is kept in captivity in a\r\nwooden box, it is easy to set it “tapping” or “rapping” by tapping\r\noneself with a pencil on the table on which the box is placed, when the\r\nfaithful little death-watch will unfailingly reply. Possibly some of the\r\n“raps” recorded by the pioneers of spirit-rapping, when not produced by\r\nthe toes of designing mediums like the young ladies of Rochester, N.Y.,\r\nwere actually made by death-watch beetles. It is certain that the\r\nsomewhat eccentric supposition that disembodied spirits endeavour to\r\nmake signals to living humanity by “rapping” owes its origin (long\r\nbefore the nineteenth-century craze for “spirit-rapping”) to the\r\nmeasured tap-tap-tapping of the death-watch beetle, and the consequent\r\nsuperstition at a time when the beetle was not known to be the “tapper.”\r\n\r\nWhilst the bigger beetle, _Xestobium_, is the common death-watch, it has\r\nbeen proved that the little furniture beetle, _Anobium_, is also a\r\ntapper, making regular and persistent strokes like the ticking of a\r\nwatch. Another insect, called the book-louse (_Atropos divinatoria_),\r\nvery minute, only one-twentieth of an inch, soft, white, and wingless,\r\nnot a beetle at all, but also a devourer of literature (Fig. 64), is\r\ndeclared by some good observers to be a “ticker” or “tapper,” but other\r\nnaturalists deny that it can make such sounds. It seems unlikely on\r\naccount of the extremely small size and softness of the book-louse, but\r\nthe matter needs further investigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.—The silver-fish insect (_Lepisma saccharina_).\r\nThe line to the right shows its natural size.]\r\n\r\nA curious fact is that the grubs of beetles such as _Anobium_ and\r\n_Xestobium_ (or other closely allied kinds) are not arrested in their\r\ntunnelling by soft metal. They cannot tackle iron plate or brass\r\nsheeting, but they will penetrate tinfoil and, what is more astonishing,\r\nlead plate and leaden waterpipes. Specimens showing such perforations\r\nare in the museums of Oxford and London, and I have received an account\r\nof a lead pipe packed in wood in the wall of a house being perforated by\r\nthese beetle-grubs. Once at work on the wood, “the straightforward\r\nintentions” of the grub are not to be diverted by such an obstacle as\r\nlead: it goes straight on through the lead as it would through the cover\r\nof a book or a knot in the wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.—The book-louse, or _Atropos divinatoria_, a\r\nsoft, cream-coloured, wingless insect smaller than a flea. It is\r\nbelieved by some observers to be capable of making sounds like the\r\nticking of a watch.]\r\n\r\nI have sometimes been asked to give advice as to the best method of\r\ndestroying the furniture worm or grub. If the piece of furniture (or its\r\npieces) can without injury be “baked” in a hot chamber for twenty-four\r\nhours, at a temperature a little above that of boiling water, that is\r\nthe easiest method of destroying the pest. Or, again, I should suggest\r\nplacing the piece of furniture in a refrigerating chamber for a week or\r\ntwo. If neither of these methods can be used, the piece of furniture\r\nshould be placed in a very hot room, and creosote or bisulphide of\r\ncarbon or solution of cyanide of potassium should be injected with a\r\nvery fine-nosed syringe into the little circular holes of the burrows on\r\nthe surface of the wood; then the piece of furniture must be at once\r\nexposed to the cold, which will cause the air to be drawn into the\r\nburrows and diffuse the volatile poison within. The “worm holes” on the\r\nsurface should, as soon as the piece of furniture is quite cold, be\r\nclosed by melted paraffin. If the piece of wood which it is desired to\r\n“cure” will stand submersion in water for a few minutes, and is not\r\nlarger than a cricket bat, it is, of course, easy, by first warming it\r\nthrough and then plunging it into water containing corrosive sublimate\r\nor other poison, fairly to impregnate the burrows, and make an end of\r\nthe beetles and their grubs. Painting is the common and approved means\r\nof protecting wood against these attacks, and in some positions metal\r\nsheathing is used. The method most largely used for protecting wood in\r\nthe open air against “worm” and “mould” is that of forcing creosote into\r\nits pores—an improvement on the old system of painting with coal tar. A\r\nmore expensive but beautiful method of protecting wood is to force hard\r\nparaffin in a melted condition by pressure into the pores. The wood\r\nbecomes wonderfully firm and waterproof. Neither damp and mould, nor\r\nboring insect, nor shrimp can then penetrate it. This method was\r\nintroduced some years ago, but I do not know whether it has been largely\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS FARE\r\n\r\n\r\nMost English people who can afford it eat more than is good for them on\r\nChristmas Day, and consider it more or less of a religious duty to do\r\nso, even though they shrink from the ordeal. It is an interesting\r\ntendency, and at the same time one readily explained. Primitive men, and\r\nour own remote ancestors, had few, if any, joys greater than those\r\nafforded by an abundant meal of roasted meat. When a great beast such as\r\na mammoth was taken in a skilfully-prepared pitfall, and slaughtered,\r\nthe whole tribe of palaeolithic huntsmen assembled and gorged themselves\r\nwith its flesh, which, it seems fairly certain, they cooked on open\r\nfires. The strongest seized the most and ate the most, and were able to\r\nbear up the longest in something like full vigour until such time as\r\nanother big beast should be killed, and another opportunity for\r\n“gorging” should arise, when they would naturally again get the largest\r\nshare, having eaten most on the previous occasion, and so being least\r\nfamished. Hence the belief that a great appetite is a fine thing, and\r\nthat the more you can eat, the stronger and better you are, is one of\r\nthe deeply-laid traditions of humanity which civilised men have\r\ninherited from barbarians, and are only slowly commencing to criticise\r\nand to put aside. The negroes who accompany European sportsmen in\r\nCentral Africa gorge themselves when elephants are killed, and a recent\r\naccount tells of the serious illness and danger to an expedition caused\r\nby the whole countryside flocking to the carcasses of twenty-three\r\nelephants killed by an ivory-hunter. The blacks continued to eat the\r\nflesh of the elephants for three weeks, when it had become decidedly\r\n“high,” and many died, whilst others took weeks to recover, in\r\nconsequence. The notion of “festivity,” which, especially in England,\r\nhas been, even in recent times, that of eating and drinking to excess,\r\nis prehistoric and barbaric. Serious physiologists and medical men have\r\nexpressed the opinion that we shall never arrive at a satisfactory mode\r\nof nourishing ourselves so as to take neither too much nor what is in\r\nitself injurious to health, until the practice of seeking gaiety and\r\ncelebrating a memory or honouring a friend or friends by means of\r\nprofuse eating (often followed by wearisome speeches) has given place to\r\na mode of rejoicing which is more likely to produce hilarity and\r\nlightness of heart, and less certain to be followed by painful and\r\ninjurious results. We certainly eat less and drink less of intoxicating\r\nliquors than we did, but there is, it seems, still room for improvement.\r\n\r\nTo connect heavy feeding with Christmas, the third in rank of the great\r\nfestivals of the Church, is not a universal custom, and is, in fact, a\r\npeculiarity of our own country, arising from the rearing and management\r\nof cattle in early times, when English pasture land furnished a splendid\r\nmeans of enriching its owners by the production of “hides” and leather.\r\nLarge numbers of cattle had to be stalled during winter and fed on\r\nstored herbage, and a great many were at this season killed and the meat\r\n“salted down,” since it would not pay to keep them on stored food. It\r\nwas not until the introduction of “root-crops” that oxen could be kept\r\nin any number through the winter months. Hence there was an excess of\r\nfresh meat and fat about Christmas time, and the “roast beef,” plum\r\npuddings, and mincemeat of Christmas fare were abundant. The true\r\nChristmas pudding and mince-pie had meat as part of their components,\r\nand, of course, beef-suet enters largely into their composition at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThe practice of eating sweet fruits and preserves with meat (as in the\r\ntrue mince-pie) still lingers in this country, but has become less\r\ngeneral than it is in Germany. We still eat red-currant jelly with roast\r\nmutton, and also with hare, and apple sauce is considered appropriate to\r\nroast pork and to goose; but pickled plums and cherries and sugared\r\ncrab-apples, which are usually taken with meat in Germany, are not known\r\nto us. I have heard a schoolboy express indignation at being given plums\r\nwith roast meat. Mincemeat, for mince-pies, was originally (like a\r\n“Cornish pasty,” in which raisins are mixed with meat) one of these\r\ncombinations of sweetness and strength—of sugar and meat—the taste for\r\nwhich has unaccountably disappeared in these days of mechanical\r\nuniformity and lack of “homely cheer.”\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the turkey as a Christmas dish dates from the early\r\ntime of the importation of that bird into Europe, namely, about 1550. It\r\nis already spoken of in connection with Christmas fare in 1570. The\r\n“turkey-cock,” as its full name was, is an American bird, and was\r\nbrought originally from Mexico to Europe, though it is possible that the\r\nmore northern American species may have been also introduced by the\r\nnavigator, Jean Cabot. There is a very gorgeous turkey-cock of\r\niridescent bright blue and green, with orange-red warts on his head and\r\nneck, found in Honduras. But he has never been acclimatised. He is on\r\nview in the Natural History Museum. The turkey belongs to the pheasant\r\nfamily, and is compared by old writers to the peacock, and also to the\r\nguinea-fowl (_Numida meleagris_ of ornithologists). Indeed, there was\r\ngreat confusion when the turkey first arrived between it and the\r\nguinea-fowl, and it appears to be owing to this mixing up of the two\r\nbirds that the American bird was called a turkey-cock, since the\r\nguinea-fowl is an African bird, and came into the hands of Europeans\r\nthrough Mussulman traders or “Turks.” So far did the confusion go that\r\nthe great Linnæus applied the Latin name _Meleagris_, which was that of\r\nthe guinea-fowl, to the “turkey” of America! Some people think that the\r\nturkey-cock established his misleading name by his cry, which they say\r\nis represented by the words “Turk-turk-turk.” Probably the turkey-cock,\r\nthough an American bird, was imported by traders who were called “Turkey\r\nmerchants” because their chief business was with the Levantine and\r\nMorocco ports. Another mistake or vagueness as to the native home of the\r\nturkey was hit upon by the French, who called it the _Poule d’Inde_,\r\nwhence their modern name for it, _Dindon_; and the same error is found\r\nin an old German name for it, _Kalkuttisch Hün_ (from Calicut, on the\r\nMalabar coast of India, where the turkey was introduced from America in\r\nthe seventeenth century, and has flourished ever since). The Swedish\r\nname for the turkey is _Kalcon_, and is only a modification of this old\r\nGerman name. Probably few animals or birds have been so persistently\r\nmisrepresented by the names given to them as the American bird which we\r\ncall the turkey.\r\n\r\nOur farmyard names for him are far better. In Scotland they call him the\r\n“Bubbly-jock,” which vividly suggests his airs and graces, whilst in\r\nSuffolk we call him a “Gobble-cock.” I know an old farmhouse near\r\nWoodbridge, in Suffolk, which bears the delightful name of “Gobblecock\r\nHall.” “The squire of Gobblecock Hall” would have furnished Randolph\r\nCaldecott with inspiration for a Christmas picture story; and so,\r\nindeed, would the country round the “Hall,” with its vast sandy tract,\r\nten miles long, known as Hollesley Heath, ending on the seashore near\r\nOrford Castle.\r\n\r\nThe misleading indication as to the native land of an animal—due to the\r\nname commonly applied to it—is remarkable in the case of the\r\nguinea-pig. Though the guinea-fowl is correctly so called, since it\r\ncomes from the Guinea Coast of Africa, the guinea-pig has nothing to do\r\nwith that coast, but comes from South America! It is not a pig, but a\r\nrodent, and it does not come from Guinea. It appears that the ships of\r\nthe “Guinea merchants” of this country established trading relations\r\nwith South American ports, and hence the little “pig” (Shakespeare calls\r\nthe hedgehog “hedge-pig”) which they brought home was called a\r\n“guinea-pig,” just as the big “cock” imported by Turkey merchants was\r\ncalled a “Turkey-cock.” The guinea-pig suffers other “indignities of\r\nappellation.” The Germans call him _Meerschweinchen_, that is, “little\r\nsea-pig.” Apparently “sea” pig, because he was brought over the sea. But\r\nthis leads to unjustifiable suggestions as to the guinea-pig’s\r\ncharacter. For the Germans call the porpoise _Meerschwein_, which would\r\nseem to mean “pig of the sea”; and those imperfectly acquainted with the\r\nGerman language have been known to take allusions made by German writers\r\nto the former animal as intended to apply to the young of the latter.\r\nThus one reads in an English medical book of a number of “young\r\nporpoises” being fed upon carrots when it was really “guinea-pigs” which\r\nconsumed this nutriment. The German physiologists, who often make use of\r\nguinea-pigs in their investigations, now call them _Cobayas_, so as to\r\navoid any further misunderstanding. The French word for a porpoise,\r\n_marsouin_, is a corruption of the German name _Meerschwein_.\r\n\r\nI have pointed out above the origin of heavy feeding at Christmas.\r\nWhether it is necessary or not to continue that precise mode of\r\ncelebration, the sentiments of peace and goodwill which belong to\r\nChristmas, the meeting of kinsmen,—and, above all, the dedication of\r\nmany of its customs to children,—are things to be cherished and treated\r\ntenderly. The 25th day of December was fixed by the Church for the\r\ncelebration of the birth of Christ, but it is fairly certain that the\r\nperiod of the year indicated in the Gospel as that when the shepherds\r\nwere watching their flocks and saw the star of Bethlehem, was not\r\nDecember, but October. It is also certain that the children owe their\r\nshare in Christmas to the combination with it of customs proper to the\r\nEpiphany, which celebrates the bringing of gifts to the child Christ by\r\nthe wise men of the East. It appears that the greatest and gayest of the\r\nfeasts of pagan Rome—the “Saturnalia”—was held at the end of December,\r\nand that the early Church in this, as in many other cases, adapted a\r\npagan custom to its own uses, and fixed the feast of the Nativity at\r\nthis date expressly in order to take over, as it were, the gaiety of the\r\nSaturnalia. The brilliant foliage and berries of the holly-tree were\r\nused for decorations at the Saturnalia, and thus became a Christmas\r\nemblem. The fun and frolic of the Saturnalia were transferred to the\r\nname of Christmas, and thus it comes about that the Yule Log and the\r\nLord of Misrule and the Abbot of Unreason, and also snapdragon and\r\nclown, harlequin and columbine, are found in full swing at\r\nChristmas-tide. Later St. Nicholas, who took the place of Neptune, and\r\nwas the patron saint of sailors, became associated with Christmas\r\ncelebrations as Santa Claus or Father Christmas. His regular day was at\r\nthe beginning of December, and so it was easy to postpone his\r\nfestivities to three weeks later.\r\n\r\nMistletoe is not a Christmas decoration. It comes to us from the Druids,\r\nand belongs to the New Year. It is not allowed to appear in church, and\r\nshould not be hung up in private houses till Christmas is over and the\r\nNew Year has come. The hanging up of the mistletoe is in itself a\r\nbeautiful survival of an ancient worship, and should be associated in\r\nour minds with Stonehenge and the prehistoric star temples, whose\r\npriests were astronomers. On New Year’s Day they solemnly distributed\r\nbranches of the mistletoe to the people as a charm ensuring fertility.\r\nIn December there are many hundredweight of mistletoe cut down and\r\ndespatched from the ancient Druidical haunts of the Welsh border, and\r\nfrom over-sea Brittany, to all-devouring London, where it is heedlessly\r\nnailed up in doorways, and made the excuse for much giggling and\r\nembracing. May those who read these lines treat it with due reverence,\r\nand when they kiss beneath the beautiful strange branch with its white\r\nberries, think of our ancestors—the noble youths and lovely maidens of\r\nprehistoric days, who kissed three thousand years ago, and sent this\r\nliving token of their happy lives down the long ages—to us, distracted\r\nhustlers of the motor-car. Prehistoric feeding may not be good for us,\r\nbut the prehistoric rite of the mistletoe must not be neglected in these\r\ndays of strange political aspirations on the part of those who have not\r\ndiscovered its sedative virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF OPIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Europe is the original home of the opium-poppy, and not Asia, is\r\neven more contradictory of our settled traditions and belief than the\r\nfact that Europeans gave tobacco to the East. Yet it is the fact that\r\nopium, like tobacco, came to the Far East from Europe. The opium-poppy\r\ndoes not grow wild in Asia; it is a cultivated variety of a\r\nMediterranean poppy, the _Papaver setigerum_, which has a pale purple\r\nflower, and was conveyed, long ago, by man from the Levant to Asia. We\r\nhave true poppies of four species which grow wild in England, all with\r\nsplendid scarlet or crimson petals, easily distinguished from one\r\nanother by the shape of the seedboxes, or capsules, which they form. If\r\nyou scratch the surface of the seed capsule of one of these poppies a\r\nmilky juice appears. It is this which is collected from the capsules of\r\nthe much larger opium-poppy in India and China, and when dried forms a\r\nhard brown cake, which is called “opium.” It consists of resinous\r\nmatter, in which is contained a small quantity of the invaluable\r\nnarcotic called “morphia,” and also small quantities of other powerful\r\npoisons.\r\n\r\nThe pale-purple poppy of the Mediterranean (_Papaver setigerum_) was\r\ncultivated hundreds—even thousands—of years ago in the South of Europe\r\nand on the Mediterranean shores of Africa—not for opium, but for the\r\noil which can be expressed from the seed, “poppy-seed oil.” The oil is\r\nfree from narcotic properties. The purple poppy is still cultivated for\r\nthat oil in France, and poppy-seed oil is an article of commerce used as\r\nfood, both in the pure state and for adulterating other oils. The\r\nearliest cultivation of this poppy is even as remote in Europe as 7000\r\nyears, for we find that the Swiss lake-dwellers of the Stone Age\r\ncultivated it, and that the variety they obtained was nearer to the wild\r\n_Papaver setigerum_ than to its cultivated derivative, the modern\r\nopium-poppy, _Papaver somniferum_. How and when it first was recognised\r\nthat the narcotic substance “opium” could be prepared from the juice\r\nexuding from the cut capsule is not exactly known, but it is probable\r\nthat it was not until the early Middle Ages that the poppy was\r\ncultivated for the habitual use of opium as a narcotic indulgence, and\r\nthat its earlier cultivation was, as to some extent at the present day,\r\nfor the sake of the oil contained in the seed, its use in medicine\r\nrequiring but a very small supply. The ancient Greeks were well\r\nacquainted with the cultivated poppy. Homer mentions it, and at a much\r\nlater period Theophrastus and Dioscorides do so. They call it “mekon,”\r\nand were aware of the somniferous properties of the sap. Dioscorides,\r\nwhose wonderful book on plants dates from the first century of our era,\r\nspeaks of the drug derived from the sap by the name “opos,” and it is\r\nfrom that word that the name “opium” has come. The Romans cultivated the\r\npoppy before the republic, and mixed its seeds with their flour in\r\nmaking bread. The story of King Tarquin taking the governor of a\r\nrebellious province into a poppy-field, lopping off the heads of the\r\ntaller poppies with his stick, and then turning to his visitor, without\r\na word, but with a look which said, “That is the way to govern”—is\r\nevidence of the very early cultivation of the poppy by the Romans.\r\nHebrew writings do not mention the opium poppy, though it seems to be\r\ncertain that it has been cultivated in Asia Minor for at least 3000\r\nyears. There is no evidence that the plant was cultivated in more\r\nancient times in Egypt, although in Pliny’s time the Egyptians used the\r\njuice of the poppy medicinally. In the Middle Ages it was, and in our\r\nown day it is, one of the chief objects of cultivation in that country,\r\nespecially for the manufacture of opium.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated variety _P. somniferum_ of the present day differs from\r\nthe wild _P. setigerum_, in having the seed-capsule surmounted by ten or\r\ntwelve stigmas (the free ends of the leaves which are united to form the\r\ncapsule), instead of by eight as in the wild form. It seems that the\r\nintroduction of the poppy from the shores of the Mediterranean into\r\nPersia, India, and China is due to Arab traders, and is coincident with\r\nthe rise of Mohammedanism; and it is probable that it was valued and\r\ncultivated from that time onwards, not so much for the sake of its seed\r\nand oil, as for the narcotic juice, which was made up by Arabian\r\n“confectioners” into a kind of paste, and eaten, as were other vegetable\r\nextracts—such as “bang,” from hemp—for the sake of the pleasurable\r\neffects produced by its poisonous action on the nervous system. It is\r\ncertain that the opium poppy does not occur at all in the wild state in\r\nthe Middle and Far East. In 1516 opium was already an article of trade\r\nfrom India to China. The poppy was cultivated, and the use of opium\r\nknown and frequent in India for some five centuries before that date.\r\nProbably the cultivation of the plant in China was not started until the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt was the Chinese who hit upon the mode of indulging in opium by\r\nsmoking it in a pipe. There is no record, written or pictorial, of this\r\npractice earlier than 1730, about fifty years before which date (1680)\r\nwe find the smoking of tobacco represented on Chinese pottery. Very soon\r\nthe Chinese were not content to import their opium from India, but large\r\nareas were put under cultivation with the Indian poppy in China and\r\nManchuria. For a century or more the export of opium from India to China\r\ncontinued and increased as the consumption of the drug increased, the\r\nnative Chinese production not being sufficient to meet the demand. In\r\n1730 and 1796 the Chinese Government issued edicts forbidding the\r\nsmoking of opium, and in the last century the efforts of the Chinese\r\nauthorities to prevent the importation of Indian opium, whether with a\r\nview to suppress a dangerous vice or to favour the home-grown article,\r\nled to war with England. In some parts of China—for instance,\r\nAmoy—three-fourths of the population are, or were until lately,\r\nopium-smokers. Now it is believed that the Chinese Government is\r\ngenuinely determined to put a stop to the dangerous and enervating\r\nindulgence in this narcotic, and the opium-growers of India will have to\r\nlimit their output, and employ their land and labour for other crops.\r\n\r\nIt is the fact that the eating of opium (for it is not “smoked” there)\r\ndoes very little harm in India, since it is not used by a large\r\nproportion of the people nor in excess. Many persons who have studied\r\nthe subject maintain that the widely-spread injury caused by opium in\r\nChina is due to the short time during which it has been in use there as\r\ncompared with India. It is held that a population after a few centuries\r\nbecomes immune to such poisonous but attractive indulgences by the\r\nkilling out of those who cannot resist excess—and the suggestion is\r\nthat the simplest way of dealing with such cravings for poison is to let\r\nthose who have them and cannot resist their demand, freely indulge and\r\ndie, and their stock with them. This is, however, a slow and tedious way\r\nof eradicating an evil tendency. It may, perhaps, be the only way, and\r\nhereafter, when the production by careful and restricted breeding of a\r\nsound and healthy population becomes recognised as being part of the\r\nduty of the makers and administrators of the law in civilised states, it\r\nis not improbable that we shall see something of the kind deliberately\r\nput into practice.\r\n\r\nThe opium-pipe and the mode of smoking at present in use in China are\r\nvery different from the pipe and smoking of tobacco used there or\r\nelsewhere. I investigated the matter myself twenty years ago in an\r\nopium-den near the London Docks, under the instruction of a polite\r\nChinaman. The opium-pipe has a very narrow cavity, about one-sixth of an\r\ninch wide. The prepared opium, in a condition resembling treacle, is\r\nsmeared on the walls of the cavity with a pin, and the pipe is held to a\r\nlighted lamp. The flame drawn into the pipe causes the opium to frizzle\r\nand give off smoke, but it does not “light” and continue to burn. Each\r\nwhiff which the smoker inhales has to be procured by applying the pipe\r\nto the lamp. The smoke is tasteless, and it requires a good deal of\r\npatience and several re-smearings of the inside of the pipe before the\r\nsmoker begins to experience the pleasant effects of the drug. These\r\nconsist in the production of a sense of perfect contentment and\r\nindifference to all trouble and care, whilst the imagination gives a\r\nrose-colour, or an even more alluring aspect, to all that one sees or\r\nthinks of—until a gentle sleep closes the scene.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, having obtained the seeds, cultivated the opium-poppy, and\r\nmade opium before the prepared article was imported in any great\r\nquantity from India. There is, of course, no doubt as to the injury\r\nwhich is done to a population by the habitual use of opium. At the same\r\ntime, there is no one who knows anything about medicine and the use of\r\ndrugs who does not speak of opium with reverence and even affection.\r\nForty years ago, at a dinner-party where the leading physicians of\r\nLondon were present, it was suggested that they should each write down\r\nin order of merit the ten drugs to which they attached the greatest\r\nvalue. I heard from one who was present that they all put opium in the\r\nfirst place, and that mercury, iodide of potassium, and ipecacuanha\r\nfollowed in that order in the majority of the lists. The value of opium\r\nas a medicinal agent is one thing; its deadly effect on those who have\r\nbecome victims to its daily use is another. The origin of the medicinal\r\nuse of opium can be traced to Egypt in Pliny’s time, but beyond that\r\nnothing is known.\r\n\r\nAs I am writing of botanical matters, I may briefly refer to an\r\nambiguity about the names “banana” and “plantain.” There is no\r\ndifference (as is sometimes suggested) between the fruits indicated by\r\nthese two words. Our word “plantain” is merely a corruption of the\r\nSpanish word _platano_, which is the name of the plane-tree. It was\r\nloosely applied in South America by the Spanish colonists to the banana\r\npalm (_Musa sapientum_), just as they called the North American bison a\r\nbuffalo, and as the Anglo-Americans call a stag an elk, and a red thrush\r\na robin. The banana palm is not an American tree, but was introduced\r\nthere from the East Indies by the early navigators, and was very soon\r\ncultivated by the South American Indians as well as by the colonists.\r\nThere have been great authorities—for instance, Humboldt—who have\r\nbelieved that there is a native South American banana palm as well as an\r\nEast Indian one; but the definite conclusion of botanists, after careful\r\ninquiry, is that there is only one species, and that it is of South\r\nAsian origin. There are an enormous number of cultivated\r\nvarieties—forty-four are described; they can all be arranged in two\r\ngroups, the large-fruited bananas (fruit 7 inches to 15 inches long),\r\nand the small-fruited bananas, commonly called fig-bananas (fruits 1\r\ninch to 6 inches long). All are equally entitled to the name “plantain”\r\nas well as “banana.” The finest flavoured varieties are cultivated in\r\nHindustan, and there only, being often of very great value and rarity.\r\nThose which come into the English market are chiefly, if not entirely,\r\nof West Indian production. The foliage of the banana palm consists of\r\noblong leaves of magnificent size and unbroken surface; small trees are\r\nto be seen in hothouses (they bear fruit at Kew), and are frequently\r\nused for decorative purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.—The human skull from the Chapelle-aux-Saints,\r\nnow in the Museum of Natural History, Paris. One-third the size (linear)\r\nof nature. _a-b_ is a line drawn from a point above the brow ridges\r\n(_a_) to a point on the exterior of the skull corresponding to the inner\r\nattachment of the membrane called the “tentorium” which separates the\r\ncerebrum above from the cerebellum beneath it. The part of the skull\r\nabove this line (or rather the horizontal plane, the edge of which it\r\nrepresents) is the cranial dome, and is in this skull comparatively\r\nshallow. Compare it with the same line and the cranial dome in Fig. 75\r\nof a Reindeer Man, which agrees with a modern European skull in the\r\ngreater height of the dome above the line _a-b_. The line drawn from the\r\nline _a-b_ to the point _e_ is the vertical line erected at the middle\r\npoint of the line _a-b_. It gives the measure of the greatest height of\r\nthe cranial dome. The line from _f_ similarly falls on to the point\r\nhalf-way between the line _e_ and the point _b_. It measures the height\r\nof the back part of the cranial dome. Compare these and the other lines\r\nin the other figures of human skulls and that of the chimpanzee (Fig.\r\n81), which are all drawn to the same scale as this figure, namely,\r\none-third the linear measurement. _c_ is the point on the top of the\r\nskull known as the “bregma”; it is the point where the frontal bone\r\nmeets the two parietal bones. The line _c-a_ cuts off a curved area\r\nlying in front of it. This is “the frontal boss,” and the vertical line\r\nto _d_, drawn from its most prominent point to the line _a-c_, gives a\r\nvery good measure of the amount of prominence and volume of the\r\nforehead. Compare this area and the line _d_ in the other skulls\r\nfigured, especially in the well-developed skull of the Reindeer Man\r\n(Fig. 75) and in the chimpanzee’s skull. The reader is referred also in\r\nregard to these measurements to my _Kingdom of Man_ (Constable & Co.).\r\nBesides these lines of measurement, the reader should note the great\r\nbrow ridges, the prominence of the whole face below the orbits (not\r\nmerely of the teeth-sockets). Fig. 65 gives the actual state of the\r\nskull. In Fig. 80 the same skull is drawn as restored by Prof. Marcelin\r\nBoule.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI\r\n\r\nTHE MOST ANCIENT MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1908-09 a very interesting discovery was announced in\r\nthe daily newspapers—the discovery of a human skull and some bones\r\nburied in a cave called the Grotto of the Chapelle-aux-Saints, in the\r\ncentral department of France, known as the Corrèze, not very far from\r\nPerigueux, in the Dordogne. An account was given of this discovery by\r\nProfessor Marcelin Boule, of the Paris Museum, to the Académie des\r\nSciences, and the description of the bones, which had been carefully\r\npieced together, and were exhibited to the meeting of the Academy, was\r\nsent by him to me (see Fig. 65). Some exaggerated statements as to the\r\nmonkey-like character of the race to which these bones belonged\r\n(exaggerated, but not altogether devoid of truth) were circulated by\r\nimaginative correspondents in the newspapers. It is the fact that these\r\nhuman remains are of enormous antiquity, and belong to a very peculiar\r\nand primitive race known as the Neander Men, so called because a skull\r\nand some bones of this same race were found fifty years ago in a cave in\r\nthe Neander valley,[7] near Elberfeld, on the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe French archæologists, or “prehistorians,” as we now call them—are\r\nthe leading discoverers in all that relates to very early man. The caves\r\nin Central and Southern France (Dordogne, Pyrenees, and Riviera) and the\r\ngravels in the north have furnished the most wonderful and interesting\r\nevidences of the existence of human beings at an immensely remote period\r\nin this part of Europe. Enthusiastic excavators and collectors of French\r\nnationality have discovered, preserved, and described the weapons,\r\ncarvings, and drawings made by the old cave-dwellers of Southern France,\r\nburied by the accumulated deposits of ages deep in the caverns where the\r\nhuman artists who made these things used to live. In England only two\r\nsuch caves containing the implements of prehistoric men have been\r\nfound—whilst a few are known in Belgium, Moravia, and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nAlthough we know an immense number of the flint instruments, bone\r\nharpoons, and carvings and drawings of the ancient cave-dwellers, yet\r\nskulls and bones of the men themselves are extremely rare. Bones,\r\nskulls, and teeth of the animals they killed and ate are abundant in the\r\ncaves—such as those of great bulls, deer, and horses. The bones also of\r\nanimals which lived in these caves and contended with the ancient men\r\nfor the possession of the shelter afforded by them, are abundant: bones\r\nof hyæna, of bear, of lion, and wolf. But human bones are exceedingly\r\nrare. This arises partly from the fact that human bones are not so thick\r\nand strong as those of large animals, and more easily soften, break up,\r\nand are lost. It is also due partly to the fact that the men were not\r\nnearly so numerous as the wild animals; but it is chiefly due to the\r\nfact that these people usually, but not always, buried their dead in the\r\nopen; and whilst the bones of animals which had been eaten were left\r\nabout in heaps on the floor of the caves, and became cemented together\r\nby the petrifying deposit caused by water dripping from the walls of\r\nthese limestone caverns or by streams actually flooding the caverns, the\r\nbodies of the men themselves were removed when they died by their\r\nfriends and families, and buried in the open ground, where they have\r\ngradually dissolved and broken up. Only a few here and there of the more\r\nancient races were buried in a cave, and are in consequence preserved\r\nuntil the present day. Obviously, it would only be an exceptional honour\r\nor superstition which would cause the giving up of a cave to the\r\ninterment of a dead body, or only rarely that a corpse could be\r\ntolerated in the floor of the cave still inhabited by living men.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that all the bones of all the men and animals\r\nwhich have lived on the earth’s surface are naturally and as a matter of\r\ncourse permanent enduring things. On the contrary, when they are buried\r\nin soil or sand permeated by water, they slowly soften and decay,\r\ndissolve and disappear. When washed into streams and rivers or into the\r\nsea, they break up and dissolve. No bones were dredged up from the floor\r\nof the ocean by the explorers of the Challenger expedition. A bone sunk\r\nin the sea gradually dissolves. Only those bones (and the same is true\r\nof shells) are permanently preserved which happen to get into certain\r\nfavourable positions, embedded in clay or hard deposit, which is not\r\ndisturbed, and becomes slowly raised up and free from soaking water\r\nbefore the bone is dissolved; or, again, those which have been protected\r\nin the accumulated deposits of the floor of a cavern covered in by\r\nlayers of hard calcareous slab or stalagmite, which usually is formed by\r\nthe water dripping from the limestone roof and walls. The limestone is\r\ndissolved like sugar, and is deposited when the water evaporates—“petrifying”\r\nthe floor of the cave. It is owing to this rarity of the natural\r\npreservation of bones that we never find more than a few of those of\r\nextinct animals of various degrees of antiquity, and never more than a\r\nvery few of those of the ancient men who lived in caverns and made\r\n“flint implements.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.—An unpolished but beautifully chipped flint\r\nknife, of the Neolithic Age, from Denmark. (This figure and Fig. 67 are\r\nfrom the guide to the antiquities of the Stone Age in the British\r\nMuseum).]\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary to dealing below with the story of “the Neander\r\nMen”—to which race the newly-found skull and bones from the Corrèze\r\nbelong—it will help to make the importance of that skeleton obvious if\r\nI very briefly and dogmatically state what are the great periods in the\r\nprehistoric record of man, and the probable distance in time from us of\r\nthose periods. It must be remembered that what I have to say applies\r\nonly to the “prehistoric history” of man in Western Europe and the\r\nMediterranean region, for it is only this part of the world which has\r\nbeen sufficiently carefully examined to yield any definite conclusions.\r\nLet us suppose that we can travel back through the ages, and proceed to\r\ndo so. We find that there are three well-marked successive periods in\r\nEurope—which are called the Iron Age, the Bronze Age, and the Stone\r\nAge. When we go back to Julius Cæsar conquering Gaul and parts of\r\nGermany and Britain, we find that the Romans had steel swords, and\r\nfreely made use of that metal for a variety of tools and constructive\r\npurposes. The Gauls and Belgi and Allemanni and Britons were still in\r\nthe Bronze Age; they had beautifully made bronze swords and daggers and\r\nhelmets and shields, which were weaker and softer than those of iron\r\nused by the Romans. The use of iron was soon spread by the conquerors,\r\nand the rest of Europe entered on the Iron Age. When the Anglo-Saxons\r\narrived in England they had iron weapons. At what date precisely the\r\nRomans themselves took to the use of iron is not known, probably they\r\nlearnt its use from the peoples of Africa; but at no distant date, a few\r\nhundred years before Christ, they, too, and the Greeks were in the\r\nBronze Age. In Western Europe we see the Bronze Age, as we travel back\r\nin time, disappearing, and we come to the Stone Age, about 2000 B.C.\r\nCopper was used at the later stage of the Stone Age, and then the alloy\r\nwith tin, which is called “bronze.” At the time that the big stones of\r\nStonehenge were set up (the smaller stones of the outer circle are more\r\nancient) the Stone Age was coming to its end, and the Bronze Age coming\r\nin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.—A polished flint axe-head, of Neolithic Age,\r\nfrom Denmark.]\r\n\r\nEverywhere, but not always within the same thousand years or so, we see\r\nas we go still farther back, the use of metal giving place to the use of\r\nstone. In Europe we see a highly-developed material civilisation from\r\nthree to seven thousand years ago. The people till the land, sow crops,\r\nkeep herds, build houses (of wood), make pottery, combs for the hair,\r\nnecklaces of amber and of shells, and other ornaments, but they have no\r\nmetal weapons or implements. They sometimes use native gold to make\r\ndecorative ornaments; but their knives, daggers, swords, saws, and\r\nhammers are all of stone, either flint or dense greenstone. We reach\r\nthis purely Stone Age in Europe at 2000 B.C.; in Egypt we do not get\r\nback to it so soon, but, about 5000 B.C., we there come upon a\r\npre-Pharaonic population which made use of beautifully-finished stone\r\nknives in place of metal. The first people we come upon in Europe as we\r\npass from the Bronze to the Stone Age had a great deal of skill and an\r\nelaborate social organisation. Their stone weapons were beautifully\r\nchipped and often highly polished (Figs. 66 and 67). We find the slabs\r\nof grit upon which they rubbed the chipped flint adzes in order to make\r\nthem smooth. But soon we find, as we go back, that polishing is unknown,\r\nand that the chipped flint adzes are used in a rough state. On entering\r\nthe Stone Age we find that we are only on the fringe of an immense\r\nperiod of “stone-weaponed humanity,” extending back for tens of\r\nthousands of generations of men, when stone (and in Europe especially,\r\nthat stone which we call “flint”) was the one great stand-by of the\r\nhuman race—the one hard cutting material which man learnt to shape and\r\napply to his own purposes—so as to make holes with it, saw with it,\r\nscrape with it, cut with it, kill with it. On account of its prodigious\r\nrange in time it is found necessary to divide the Stone Age into two\r\nperiods—a later, called the “Neolithic” (the new stone period), and an\r\nolder, stretching back until the traces of it are lost in geologic\r\nchanges of the earth, which is called the “Palæolithic” (the old stone\r\nperiod).\r\n\r\nThus if we start on a time-journey to explore the earliest traces of man\r\nin Europe, we pass along the centuries back, through the Iron and the\r\nBronze Ages of humanity, and arrive at the vast Stone Age, which\r\nstretches away into the obscurity of more than a hundred thousand,\r\nprobably of many hundred thousand, years. The later or newer fringe of\r\nthe Stone Age is called the “Neolithic,” or newer Stone Age, or Age of\r\nPolished Stone, because the men of that period polished their stone\r\nimplements after chipping them into shape. That which we dimly see\r\nbeyond is the “Palæolithic,” or older period of “stone-weaponed”\r\nhumanity, when polishing was unknown.\r\n\r\nThe Neolithic civilisation comprised the Swiss and Glastonbury\r\nlake-dwellers, who built houses on piles in the water: also the makers\r\nof the kitchen-middens of Denmark, and the builders of the great stone\r\navenues, circles, and cromlechs, and the elevators of the solitary big\r\nstones called “menhirs”—most of them rougher and probably two thousand\r\nor three thousand years older than the big stones of Stonehenge. Our\r\njourney has now brought us into the full darkness of prehistoric times.\r\nWe cannot tell how far back this “Neolithic” period reaches, but there\r\nare things found which make it certain that it reaches to 7000 B.C., and\r\nprobably a good deal farther. We are now far in time behind the most\r\nancient Greeks and the more ancient Egyptians. Europe is a rich, moist\r\npasture-land, peat bogs are abundant and luxuriant woodlands; the\r\nclimate is mild; the wild animals are those which to-day inhabit Central\r\nEurope, but more abundant. The domesticated animals kept by the men are\r\nthose which we have to-day, and many of the crops and cultivated plants\r\nare those of our own time, such as wheat, barley, oats, and rye. We know\r\nalso by their remains that the Neolithic men fed on chestnuts, hazel\r\nnuts, walnuts, plums, apples, pears, and strawberries, and cultivated\r\nthe vine, the pale opium-poppy, and the narrow-leaved flax. Hemp was not\r\nknown to them.\r\n\r\nAs we push back still farther into the night of antiquity—we cannot say\r\nat how many thousand years from to-day, whether ten, twenty, or fifty\r\nthousand—the climate becomes very cold, the glaciers extend far down\r\nthe valleys, and we note that the level of sea and land has changed.\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland are part of the Continent of Europe. There are\r\nstrange animals in the south of what was England, and there, as well as\r\nin France, reindeer abound, wild horses, the bison, the Siberian saiga\r\nantelope, the great ox, bears, gluttons, and wolves; and there are men\r\nliving in caves—the natural caverns which form in limestone rock. These\r\nmen are chipping flints (but do not polish them) and carving bones, but\r\nnow have no herds, nor cultivated fields, nor pottery (some very rough\r\nfragments have been found), nor buildings, nor earthworks. They are like\r\nsome modern savages, Nature’s gentlemen, “who toil not, neither do they\r\nspin,” but they hunt and fish. They live entirely on the produce of the\r\nchase and on fish, wild fruits, and roots.\r\n\r\nThey wear undressed skins and furs, and paint or tattoo their faces.\r\nThey make twisted ropes (probably of skin) which they fix as a halter\r\nround the head and jaw of the wild horse, as shown by their own carvings\r\n(Figs. 8 and 9). Probably they ride him. They certainly eat him. At\r\nSolutré, near Mâcon, the bones of no less than a hundred thousand horses\r\nwere found piled up as a sort of kitchen-midden round a camp of\r\nPalæolithic men! They have the art of making fire, and have a wonderful\r\nartistic skill in carving and drawing on bone and ivory and on stones,\r\nand in painting on the walls of their caves, the animals which surround\r\nthem and are hunted by them (Fig. 71). They make great numbers of carved\r\nharpoons or toothed spear-heads (Fig. 68) from bone, and also needles\r\nfor sewing skins; whilst from flint they chip spear-heads, knives,\r\nhand-hatchets, and saws. They decorate their carvings with spirals,\r\nlozenges, and circles cut in low relief (Fig. 69). But their truly\r\nastonishing skill and mental development is shown in their carvings and\r\nengravings of animals and fish (Fig. 70), which are executed either on\r\nbones or stones, or on pieces of the ivory of the mammoth. Besides the\r\nreindeer, horses, goats, saiga antelope, rhinoceros, mammoth, and seal,\r\ntheir carvings include statuettes and drawings of men and women (Fig.\r\n7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.—_A._ Perforated harpoon of the transition\r\nperiod (Azilian or Red Deer period), between Palæolithic and Neolithic,\r\nmade from antler of red deer, found in quantity in the upper layers of\r\ndeposit in the cavern of the Mas d’Azil (Ariège). _B_ and _C_.\r\nImperforate harpoons or lance heads made from reindeer antler of the\r\nMagdalenian period (Reindeer epoch). _B_ from Bruniquel Cave\r\n(Tarn-et-Garonne). _C_ from a cavern in the Hautes Pyrenées. Same size\r\nas the objects.]\r\n\r\nAt the best period some of these carvings show a mastery of the\r\nmaterial, a directness and a simplicity and beauty of essential line,\r\ntogether with true observation of characteristic form, which separate\r\nthese works from those of the ordinary savage of modern times, and have\r\ncaused living artists of authority to declare that these craftsmen had\r\nthose definite gifts which entitle them to be recognised as brother\r\nartists—an assurance which confirms my own impression based on a long\r\nstudy of large series of the actual specimens. The best works of their\r\nlater period (for their skill took time to develop, and follows the laws\r\nof growth of all art) represent animals, such as deer, in movement and\r\noften turning round or foreshortened (Fig. 70); some of their carvings\r\nof horses’ heads are worthy of the Parthenon (Fig. 9). On the other\r\nhand, as is often observed in primitive art, their representations of\r\nthe human face and figure are very inferior, and tend to caricature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.—A piece of mammoth ivory carved with spirals\r\nand scrolls from the cave of Arudy (Hautes Pyrenées). Same size as the\r\nobject.]\r\n\r\nWe are now in the Palæolithic period, and, what is more, we have quitted\r\nwhat geologists call the recent or modern epoch, and have entered on\r\n“geologic” times; this is the Pleistocene or Quaternary epoch. It is a\r\nlegitimate and useful thing thus to draw a strong line between the\r\nNeolithic and the Palæolithic portions of the Stone Age. The Neolithic\r\nmen belong, so to speak, to our own days. They were, even seven thousand\r\nyears ago, only a little rougher in their tools than were the peasants\r\nof the remoter parts of Central Europe a few hundred years ago. They had\r\nnot even as much tendency to or gift for artistic work as the ploughmen\r\nof our own days, and have left none behind them. Excepting that they\r\nused stone axes and knives instead of steel ones, they really led the\r\nlife of mediæval country-folk. But once you pass them in your journey\r\nbackwards—once you enter the Pleistocene circle—you find that climate,\r\nland surface, animals, plants, mode of life are as utterly changed as\r\nwere you suddenly transferred from the English countryside to Terra del\r\nFuego or to an Eskimo village. The Palæolithic men and their whole\r\nsurroundings and arts of life have no touch of familiarity for the\r\nmodern inhabitants of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.—Carving on an antler of a group of three red\r\ndeer and four fishes, remarkable for the attitude and movement of the\r\ndeer: _a_, hind legs of front deer, the rest broken away: _bf_, second\r\ndeer: _c_, third deer looking back: _d_, lozenge marks, supposed to be\r\nthe artist’s signature: _bh_, the hind legs of the second deer,\r\nwonderfully true to nature in their “hanging” pose. From the cavern of\r\nLorthet, near Lourdes (Hautes Pyrenées), deposit of the Reindeer epoch.\r\nThe carving runs all round a cylindrical rod of bone (as very many of\r\nthese carvings do), and is here represented as “un-rolled” or\r\n“developed,” that is to say, laid out flat. The drawing is a little\r\nreduced as compared with the actual carving.]\r\n\r\nWhen we explore this Palæolithic, Pleistocene, or Quaternary epoch—the\r\nlast of the geologists’ long series of epochs and deposits—we find that\r\nit represents by no means a trivial episode in the world’s long change.\r\nIt is true that compared to geologic periods which follow on below\r\nit—namely, the Pliocene, Miocene, and Eocene of the Tertiary, the Chalk\r\nand the vast ages below that white sea-sediment, indicated by the sixty\r\nthousand feet of stratified rock (Jurassic, Triassic, Carboniferous,\r\nDevonian, Silurian, Cambrian!), the Pleistocene exhibits but a small\r\nthickness of deposit (amounting to but two or three hundred feet of sand\r\nand gravel) as its contribution to the earth’s crust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.—Painting of a bison in orange-brown, grey,\r\nblack, and white, the outline partly engraved, from the roof of the cave\r\nof Altamira, near Santander, in the north of Spain, upon which many\r\nothers as well as wild-boar, horses, and deer are depicted. The original\r\nis about two and a half feet long. These drawings were executed by the\r\nReindeer Men in the period of the Upper or Post-Glacial Pleistocene.]\r\n\r\nYet, on account of the nearness to our own times of the events which\r\ntook place in the Pleistocene period, geologists and prehistorians have\r\nstudied its details with minute care, and have accumulated an immense\r\narray of facts and specimens by digging and carefully collecting in\r\nWestern and Central Europe. They have divided up this Pleistocene period\r\nand the deposits in river-valley and cave which have occurred within its\r\nlimits into three great consecutive ages. These are distinguished from\r\none another by the distinctive wild animals which flourished in each,\r\nby the climate which is indicated, and by the progressive development of\r\nthe art and workmanship of the Palæolithic men discovered in successive\r\nlayers of deposit. Let me here refer the reader to the tabular statement\r\non page 384 _bis_.\r\n\r\nThese ages of the Pleistocene are:—No. 1. The Upper or Post-Glacial\r\nPleistocene, or =Epoch of the Reindeer=. The climate was cold and dry,\r\nlike that of the Russian steppes. The contents of the celebrated cave of\r\nLa Madeleine, in the Dordogne, and the upper layers of deposit in a\r\nwhole series of caves (including Kent’s Cavern and the Creswell Cave in\r\nEngland) belong to this age. This was the period in which the caves were\r\ninhabited by the artistic race “who came no one knows whence, and went\r\nno one knows whither,” accompanied by the reindeer. Before them there\r\nwas no carving in the caves, or only very rough work, and we are\r\njustified in concluding that the men who inhabited the caves before this\r\nperiod belonged to a totally distinct and inferior race. The “Reindeer\r\nMen” must have developed their art by gradual steps before they arrived\r\nin the caves of Western Europe—where we do not know. At the end of this\r\nperiod the climate became much milder, and the red deer of our own day\r\ntook the place of the reindeer, during a long transition in which the\r\n“Reindeer Men” and their art disappeared, and the pastoral,\r\nland-tilling, stone-building, pottery-making communities of the\r\nNeolithic Age came into existence, showing no trace of the art of their\r\npredecessors. The mammoth and rhinoceros, bison, and aurochs, and, in\r\nfact, all the commoner animals of an earlier period were present nearly\r\nall through the Reindeer period (they disappear in the late “transition\r\nperiod” of the red deer, called “Azilian”), and were known to the\r\n“Reindeer Men,” but great herds of reindeer and of horses occupied the\r\ngrassy lands in this age, which were not abundant previously. These\r\nherds probably were to some extent protected by the men, whilst the\r\nlion, bear, hyæna, mammoths, and rhinoceroses were diminishing in\r\nnumber, and were kept at a distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.—Back and front view of a flint implement of the\r\nMoustier type (period of the Neander Men or Middle Pliocene), half the\r\nsize (linear) of the object. Observe the bulb of percussion at _b_, and\r\nthe completion of one face by a single blow. Note also the fine edge and\r\npoint of the weapon.]\r\n\r\nThe next lower division of the Pleistocene is No. 2, the Middle\r\nPleistocene or Last Glacial Age, or better, the =Epoch of the Mammoth=.\r\nThe climate was cold and humid. For the third and last time great\r\nglaciers existed over the whole of Northern Europe, and only bits of the\r\nsouth of England and the central and southern parts of France were free\r\nfrom the ice-covering, and carried a rich vegetation. Deeper deposits in\r\ncaves are of this age, and also much of the river gravels of the\r\nlower terraces of English and French rivers. By the French it is often\r\ncalled the Moustierian period, because it is well seen in the rich\r\ndeposits of the caves and plateau of Le Moustier, on the river Vezère\r\n(an affluent of the Dordogne), which contain bones of mammoth and\r\nrhinoceros, and flint implements of a special form (Fig. 72), but no\r\ncarvings or artistic work. Hyænas made some of the caverns into their\r\ndens, and the cave-lion and the cave-bear were there too. The men of\r\nthis period actually contested with these carnivors for the possession\r\nof the caves, and made great fires to keep out wild beasts, as well as\r\nto grill the meat on which they fed. They were of an inferior race to\r\nthe Reindeer Men, and had not such command of the situation as their\r\nsuccessors. We find their remains, their flint weapons, and in rare\r\ncases their own bones as well as the bones of the mammoth and hairy\r\nrhinoceros (on which they fed), and the bones of their competitors, the\r\nhyænas, bears, and lions, in the deeper deposits of some caves,\r\nunderlying, and separated often by calcareous deposit from, the layers\r\nwhich belong to the subsequent and prosperous days of the Reindeer Men.\r\nMost striking is the fact that in the layers of deposit of this older\r\nage, there are no works of art nor any implements carved from bone or\r\nivory. These earlier men, devoid of art and living at a low level of\r\nsavagery, were the Neander Men. It is in this layer and under these\r\nconditions that the few broken skulls, agreeing in shape and character\r\nwith that of the Neander Valley, have been found.\r\n\r\nLastly we come to division No. 3, the Lower Pleistocene, or =Epoch of the\r\nHippopotamus=. The later climate of this age was mild. It came between\r\ntwo glacial periods, owing to the retreat of the glaciers, which had\r\nearlier increased in extent so as to produce the second Great Glacial\r\nperiod. The hippopotamus swam in the Thames and Severn in those days,\r\nand left its bones and teeth in the older gravels of those and other\r\nEuropean rivers, where we now find them. The big almond-shaped and\r\nleaf-shaped flint implements of the English (Fig. 73) and French gravels\r\n(Fig. 74) belong to this period. We have no knowledge whatever of the\r\nmen who made them.[8] The mammoth was not there, but another species of\r\nelephant (_E. antiquus_) and a peculiar rhinoceros (_R. merckii_). The\r\ndeepest and oldest deposits in some caves belong to this age, as well as\r\nthe high-lying gravels of St. Acheuil, of many English river-valleys,\r\nand of Chelles on the Seine. This period is not represented by much\r\ndeposit in caves, though some caves contain very deep-lying layers\r\nenclosing bones or teeth of the animals characterising this period.\r\n\r\nOlder than the Age of the Hippopotamus are deposits which are reckoned\r\nby geologists as “Pliocene”—no longer Pleistocene—and are called\r\n“Tertiary,” not “Quaternary.” The forest bed of Norfolk (regarded by\r\nProfessor Marcelin Boule as of transitional character, as shown in the\r\ntabular view on p. 384 _bis_), the Norwich crag, the Suffolk red and\r\ncoralline crag, and very extensive sandy deposits all over Europe belong\r\nto the Pliocene. The earliest or first great extension of glaciers\r\noccurred late in this period. The animals are very different from those\r\nof the Pleistocene; the great mastodon and the tapir are there, and the\r\nsabre-toothed tiger. Implements manufactured by man are found in the\r\noldest Pleistocene, and there is no reason to doubt that we shall find\r\nhis workmanship in the Pliocene, too, though it is not admitted that\r\nthis has yet been done. It is a question still eagerly studied and\r\ndebated as to whether the roughly chipped flints found in gravels on\r\nhigh downs in the south of England, and called “eoliths,” are (as I\r\nthink many of them are) the work of man, and whether the high-lying\r\ngravels in which they are found are to be regarded as of the oldest\r\nPleistocene Age or as late Pliocene. It is an exciting and deeply\r\ninteresting field of practical exploration and reasoned inference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.—Flint pick from the Lower Pleistocene of the\r\nThames Valley. Two-thirds the size of the object.]\r\n\r\nIt will have been gathered from what I have said that, in seeking for\r\nknowledge of the sequence of events in the period of Palæolithic Man,\r\neverything depends upon extreme care in removing the deposits from a\r\ncave inch by inch, and keeping all objects found distinct from one\r\nanother and assigned to their proper layer. The same system is now\r\napplied with great success to the exploration of ancient cities in Egypt\r\nand Central Asia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.—A rough type of flint implement from the Lower\r\nPleistocene of the Somme Valley (St. Acheuil). One-half the size of the\r\nobject.]\r\n\r\nAs to the actual bones and skulls of men discovered in these Pleistocene\r\ndeposits, they show us that the Reindeer Men were a fine, full-brained\r\npeople, as we should expect, with as large a brain cavity on the average\r\nas that of modern Europeans. The skulls of this race, which do not\r\ndiffer in character from those of highly developed modern races, were\r\nfirst found at Cromagnon, and hence we may call them “the Cromagnards”\r\n(Fig. 75). The Neander Men are the men of the middle period—the last\r\nglacial period—who were displaced by the splendid and accomplished\r\nCromagnards. The Neander Men, of which the new French specimen (Fig. 65)\r\nfrom the cave of the Chapelle-aux-Saints is one, were a very inferior\r\nrace, and so different from any living race of men as to justify the\r\nrecognition of them as a distinct species of man, the _Homo\r\nNeanderthalensis_. Only a few other imperfect skulls and skeletons of\r\nthem are known (Figs. 76 and 77), and show them to have been short\r\npeople, with very low, flat heads and retreating foreheads. It is in\r\naccordance with what one would expect, that they should make no works of\r\nart, and should be displaced, as climatic conditions changed for the\r\nbetter, by the arrival of the fine, full-brained Cromagnards or Reindeer\r\nMen. But where did they, these delightful artists and happy hunters of\r\nthe Reindeer Epoch, come from? We cannot say. And what became of them?\r\nWe do not know. They did not give rise to the Neolithic race, but were\r\nreplaced, turned out by that race. To them, indeed, are appropriate the\r\nwords of the Roman poet—_Prolem sine matre creatam, mater sine prole\r\ndefuncta_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.—A profile and a front view of the skull and\r\nlower jaw of a man of the Cromagnard race or Reindeer Men. This is the\r\ntype-skull from Cromagnon. The teeth have fallen out of their sockets,\r\nand the articular condyle of the up-turned part of the lower jaw is\r\nbroken away.

The\r\n    horse has been found in tens of thousands at Solutré, near Mâcon\r\n    (Middle Pliocene), whilst the great Irish deer abounded at a very\r\n    late period in Ireland (Azilian?), and is rare at any time\r\n    elsewhere. I must clearly state that, whilst this table is\r\n    practically that published by my friend Professor Marcelin Boule, he\r\n    is not responsible for the recognition of the Eoliths of Prestwich,\r\n    nor for the terms “Cromagnard” and “Neander.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[7] So named after one Neumann, a religious enthusiast, who inhabited\r\nthe cave.\r\n\r\n[8] See, however, farther on as to the lower jaw found at Heidelberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII\r\n\r\nTHE CAVE-MEN’S SKULLS\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain number of human skulls and a few complete skeletons have been\r\nfound in the cave-deposits, and even in open ground (as at Predmost, in\r\nMoravia) associated with the bones of extinct animals, or with carvings\r\nand ornaments like those which occur abundantly in the caverns. The\r\nancient cave-men of the Cromagnard type—often called “the Reindeer\r\nMen”—buried their dead sometimes in the caves, but more usually in the\r\nopen. Sometimes the skeletons are found in a crouching position, as\r\nthough tied up when buried; more rarely (as in some examples found in\r\nthe caves at Mentone) they are stretched out and decorated with a\r\nnecklace or wreath made of shells, or of the teeth or small bones of\r\nanimals. In many cases the flesh was removed from the corpse, and red\r\nochre was smeared on the bones (as by some recent savages). The\r\n“Reindeer” people used red ochre and charcoal to colour the engravings\r\nof animals (Fig. 71) which they made on the walls of their caves, and\r\nprobably for painting or tattooing their own faces. The existence of\r\nthese wall paintings, wonderful representations of bison, great ox,\r\ndeer, and other animals, proves that these men had artificial light\r\n(lamps or torches) to send fitful gleams on to the paintings, and it is\r\nprobable that the “wall pictures” had to do with some kind of\r\nwitchcraft. Stone lamps have actually been discovered in the caves.\r\nTheir ceremonial treatment of the dead shows that already the lines were\r\nlaid for that worship of the “spirits of the departed,” which became\r\ngeneral, and is especially familiar to us in the comparatively modern\r\ncivilisation of Rome and the Etruscans. There is also evidence that they\r\nmade simple musical instruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.—Three views of the skull-top from near\r\nElberfeld on the Rhine, known as the Neanderthal skull—(Middle\r\nPleistocene, Moustierian, or last Glacial Period: epoch of the Mammoth).\r\nThese figures are partly copied by kind permission of Mr. Worthington G.\r\nSmith, F.L.S., from excellent figures published by him in his\r\ninteresting book, _Man, the Primitive Savage_ (Stanford, 1899). In all\r\nrespects the measurements of this skull-top agree very closely with\r\nthose of the skull from the Chapelle-aux-Saints. _A._ A view from in\r\nfront. _B._ Side view showing the line _a-b_, and the other lines,\r\n_a-c_, _d_, _e_, and _f_, exactly as in Fig. 65. The shallowness of the\r\ncranial dome and the small projection of the frontal boss _d_, agree\r\nexactly with the measurements of the Chapelle skull shown in Fig. 65.\r\n_C._ View of the skull-top from below. This gives the outline of the\r\nNeander-man’s skull as seen from above, and shows the curious vizor-like\r\nexpansion of the ridges over the orbits, the pinching in just behind\r\nthem, and the elongate shape of the skull, with its great breadth in the\r\nhinder region. The French skull from the Chapelle agrees exactly in\r\noutline with this, and in both the volume of the cranial cavity given by\r\nthis large expanse amounts to 1600 cubic centimetres, in spite of the\r\nflatness of the cranial dome—a greater volume than that of the\r\nCromagnon skull drawn in Fig. 75, or of the average modern European.]\r\n\r\nIn the cave-deposits of the Post-Glacial or Reindeer Age, the human\r\nskulls and skeletons which have been found (not indicating more than\r\nthirty or forty individuals altogether from widely separate localities)\r\nshow a very well-developed race, with large brain-case (Fig. 75), quite\r\nequal to that of modern Europeans. Some of these men were very tall, one\r\nof the skeletons from the Mentone caves being that of a man 6 ft. 3½\r\nin. in height. The cavity of the skull (which corresponds very closely\r\nin size with that of the brain which it contained) would hold about 1550\r\nunits of water (the unit referred to is a cubic centimetre, 1550 of\r\nwhich are equal to a little less than two and a half English pints). It\r\nis not surprising that these Reindeer Men had fine brains, for their\r\ncarvings and pictures show them to have been real artists, not mere\r\nsavage scrawlers. This race is called the “Cromagnards,” after the first\r\nskulls discovered at Cromagnon, in Central France. They had big, strong\r\nlower jaws, with prominent chins, like many fine modern races (_e.g._\r\nthe New Zealanders), and fine, narrow noses. The face and upper jaws\r\nwere somewhat prominent, though not nearly so much so as in modern\r\nnegroes. The skull-bones were thick and strong. The brain-case or\r\ncranial part of the skull was oblong rather than round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.—The Gibraltar skull from a cave in Gibraltar,\r\nnow preserved in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, London. It\r\nis of the Neander race. Compare the dotted lines and lettering with\r\nthose of Fig. 65, and the explanation there given. The drawing is\r\none-third (linear) of the natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe skulls of the older race—that of the Last Glacial or Moustierian\r\nAge—the Neander Men, were long skulls, too, but had a peculiarly\r\nflattened shape and a retreating forehead. The bony ridges over the\r\neyes, corresponding to the eyebrows, were enormous, and projected\r\nforwards like the vizor of a cap (Figs. 65, 76, and 77). There are but\r\nfew specimens to guide our conclusions, but they show that though of\r\nshort stature (some not more than 5 ft. 4 in.), these people were very\r\nmuscular. The top of a skull from the cave in the Neander Valley, known\r\nas the Neanderthal skull, two imperfect skulls from the cave of Spy, in\r\nBelgium, an imperfect skull from Brunn, in Moravia, and other fragments\r\nfrom Krapina, in Croatia, and, lastly, one from a cave in Gibraltar, are\r\nthe best known. Others, including fragments of several skeletons less\r\nfully described, which have been found at Predmost, in Moravia, probably\r\nbelong to this race. But the newly obtained skull and bones from the\r\ncentre of France (Chapelle-aux-Saints) are the most important of all\r\nyet discovered. They all date from the middle Pleistocene period, the\r\nage of the last great glaciers, earlier than the age of the Reindeer.\r\nThe Gibraltar skull (Fig. 77) we have all known for a long time; it has\r\nbeen in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons for forty years, and\r\ntwo years ago was very carefully examined and figured by Professor\r\nSollas, of Oxford. It is a specially valuable specimen, because it shows\r\nthe bones of the face as well as the brain-case. From other specimens we\r\nknow the lower jaw. The lower jaw was deep and powerful, but, like that\r\nof an ape, had a receding chin, or rather, we should say, had no\r\n“chin-prominence” at all (compare Figs. 79, 80, 81, and 82). The new\r\nFrench specimen (Fig. 65) is strongly prognathous. The orbits are\r\nenormous, and the nose very flat and quite unique in its great breadth.\r\nOne of the two Neander-man skulls from the Belgian cave of Spy shows the\r\nface bones, and these agree with what has just been stated as to the\r\nFrench skull.\r\n\r\nHence it appears that a short race with a very strange and low-browed\r\ntype of skull preceded the men of the Reindeer Age. When, thirty years\r\nago, only the original skull-top from the Neander cave (Fig. 76) was\r\nknown, Virchow, of Berlin, considered it to be probably that of an\r\nidiot, whilst Huxley expressed the opinion that it indicates a race of\r\nmen with decidedly low development, and in some respects more ape-like\r\ncharacters than modern Europeans; but he held that it is not to be\r\nconsidered as “a missing link,” nor as taking us appreciably nearer from\r\nmodern man to the apes, since it is most closely approached by the flat\r\nskulls, already well known, of some of the South Australian natives,\r\nboth in shape and in the cubical capacity of the brain-cavity. What I\r\nmean by the flatness of the skull may be understood by looking at a side\r\nview of a monkey’s skull (Fig. 81) and of an ordinary European human\r\nskull (take the Cromagnon skull as equivalent, Fig. 75) placed upright,\r\nso that the eyes are looking forward. If in an outline or photograph of\r\neach of these skulls you draw a straight line from a point between the\r\neyebrows back to a point just below the most projecting ridge of the\r\nhindermost region of the skull, you will find that above that line in\r\nthe monkey’s skull is a slightly curved surface—the roof of the\r\nbrain-case. But in the human skull above the similarly drawn line the\r\nroof bulges so as to form an almost hemispherical dome, rising sometimes\r\nvertically in the front region to form “the straight, high forehead”\r\n(which Shakespeare commended, even in woman). It swells out in the\r\nhinder region also. Now the Neander skulls, and to a less extent the\r\nskulls of many of the Australian aborigines, are more like the monkey’s\r\nin this matter; the dome of the roof is shallow and flat, and the\r\nforehead does not rise up, but slopes backwards, so that the whole\r\ncontents of the brain-case are lessened by the reduction of the frontal\r\nand upper region. And there is reason to consider this frontal region of\r\nthe brain as specially connected with some of the higher intellectual\r\nqualities of the mind.\r\n\r\nWe know a little more about the skull of the Neander race since Huxley\r\nwrote, owing to the further discovery of specimens. The Australian’s\r\nskull has usually a more projecting upper jaw and upper front teeth than\r\nhas the Neander Man’s. The Neander skulls stand alone in the great\r\nbreadth of the orbits and of the nasal region as compared with all known\r\nskulls. They are also alone (the Gibraltar skull and the new French\r\nspecimen are the only ones which show it) in the contour of the upper\r\njaw. In other human skulls there is a broad depression of the surface—a\r\nnipping-in, as it were—behind the root of the canine tooth on each\r\nside. This is absent in the Neander race; the bone here is flat, and\r\nnot in-pushed. This absence of “modelling,” absence of the canine\r\n“fossa” or valley (as it is called), is seen in the larger apes as well\r\nas in the Neander Men. This point does not show in our figures. Some\r\nwriters think it probable that the Neander Men of the late Glacial Age\r\nwere the ancestors of the Cromagnards of the Reindeer Age, and also that\r\nthe artistic Cromagnards were transformed, after many thousand years,\r\ninto the comparatively dull and inartistic people of the Neolithic\r\nperiod. It seems to me, on the contrary, more probable (as is held by\r\nsome of the French prehistorians) that the Reindeer Men died out, and\r\nwere replaced by the Neolithic herdsmen who migrated into Western Europe\r\nas the climate became milder. The notion that the Esquimaux of to-day\r\nare the Reindeer Men of France who have migrated northwards with their\r\nreindeer, following the receding ice, has been entertained, but is\r\nregarded by the most careful inquirers as untenable. As to the earlier\r\nchange of race, I hold that it is not possible to contend that the\r\nNeander Men developed into the Cromagnards of the Reindeer Age actually\r\nin the south of France. If the lower race or species gave rise to the\r\nhigher, the enormous transformation did not occur here nor in Europe at\r\nall, nor during the later Pleistocene period. Human skulls of the\r\nReindeer Age are known which present an approach to the characters of\r\nthe Neander race, such as the heavy bony eyebrows. But it seems that\r\nthis is accounted for by the survival of some Neander families alongside\r\nof the powerful Cromagnard men and the interbreeding of the two. The\r\nCromagnards had probably lived with their reindeer in some more southern\r\narea during the late Glacial Age, and arrived in southern France as the\r\nclimate improved and became suitable to their accustomed quarry. How and\r\nwhere they developed from a lower type of men we have at present no\r\nindication.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable discovery of the last five years made in the course of\r\nthe careful excavation of the four caverns of Mentone by the Prince of\r\nMonaco, where as many as sixteen human skeletons of the Pleistocene Age\r\nhave been brought to light, gives us a new point of view as to the\r\npresence of more than one race in Europe in these immensely remote\r\ntimes, as in later periods. In one of the caves, and in a position\r\nshowing them to date from the deepest layer of the middle Pleistocene,\r\nor late Glacial Age, two complete skeletons have been found (and may be\r\nseen alongside those of the Cromagnon race in the museum at Monaco),\r\nwhich are obviously different from those of both the Neander and the\r\nCromagnon people. They have skulls which decidedly resemble that of the\r\nmodern negro race, so that they have been definitely assigned to a new\r\nrace hitherto unknown in European caves, and are spoken of as “the\r\nnegroid skeletons” and “the Grimaldi race.” This is indeed a startling\r\nfact. There was land stretching across the Mediterranean in those days,\r\nand these skeletons suggest that already there was a negroid race in\r\nAfrica, individuals of which had wandered north as far as the maritime\r\nAlps.[9] Two or three negroid skulls of Neolithic (therefore very much\r\nlater) Age have been found in Brittany and in Switzerland. When we\r\nreflect that the negroid skeletons of Mentone and those of the\r\ncontemporary Neander Men are probably more than 100,000 years old, we\r\nare at once impressed with the important conclusion that already in that\r\nremote period three great branches of the human race had come into\r\nexistence—the negroid, the Neander, and probably, at a more distant\r\nspot, also the highly developed Cromagnards. The origin of the really\r\nprimitive race of man is thrown back in time by these facts to a still\r\nmore remote period, in fact, to an earlier geologic epoch. And it is to\r\nbe noted over and above these facts that we have no indication as to\r\nwhere the much later race, the Neolithic Men, came from, nor who were\r\ntheir contemporaries outside the European area; nor again do we know\r\nwhere the historic races who succeeded the Neolithic Men took their\r\norigin. When other regions of the earth have been examined as carefully\r\nas Western Europe has been, we shall no longer be in such complete\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nWhen one ventures to speculate as to the story of the earliest men in\r\nEurope, one can but feel, even after handling the specimens and\r\ncarefully following the excavations, how small and fragmentary and\r\ndifficult to interpret is the evidence at present brought to light. And\r\nyet there the evidence is, gathered with the utmost care and intelligent\r\nmethod, discussed and interpreted by men of rare knowledge and\r\nexperience, who, after long comparison of contending opinions and the\r\ndiscovery of an ever-increasing body of fact, have arrived at a definite\r\ncertainty as to the sequence of arts, races, animals, and climates which\r\nI have given above, and is again summarised in the tabular statement on\r\npage 384 _bis_.\r\n\r\nHereafter these conclusions will be modified and extended by excavations\r\nin other parts of the world, at present untouched. The one point upon\r\nwhich the best authorities will not commit themselves is the exact, or\r\neven approximately exact, number of thousands of years which these\r\nevents have occupied. The whole story, so far as it is at present worked\r\nout, is a marvellous result of patient research and scientific\r\nreasoning. Some of the cave collections upon which it is based are to\r\nbe seen in London, in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.—The skull-top of the primitive kind of man from\r\nPleistocene sands in Java, called _Pithecanthropus_. One-third (linear)\r\nof the natural size. Compare with Fig. 65, and refer to that figure for\r\nthe explanation of the letters and dotted lines.]\r\n\r\nThere is one other discovery of a fossil man which comes properly at\r\nthis point, to cap and confirm what has already been said. Fifteen years\r\nago a skull-top and a thigh-bone were found by Dr. Dubois at Trinil, in\r\nthe island of Java, at a depth of thirty feet in a sandy deposit,\r\nconsidered by good authority (but not certainly) to be of Pliocene age.\r\nFrom recent reports on the deposit it seems that it may very well be of\r\nPleistocene age. These remains have become celebrated as those of a\r\nmonkey-like man, and the name Pithecanthropus has been given to the\r\ncreature to which they belonged. This skull-top (or cranial roof) is now\r\nin Utrecht, and is well known (Fig. 78). It indicates a race of men or\r\nmen-like creatures, with the flatness of skull, receding forehead, and\r\nlarge bony eye-ridges, such as we see in the Neander Men and in some\r\nSouth Australians, but greatly exaggerated. The skull was so low and\r\nflat as greatly to resemble that of the Gibbon, though much larger. The\r\nvolume of the cranial cavity (showing the size of the brain) was about\r\n900 units—far smaller than that of the average Australian—the skull of\r\nsmallest cavity among living races of men. The volume of the\r\nbrain-cavity of the largest ape (gorilla) amounts to about 500 units\r\n(cubic centimetres); so that, allowing for rare individual fluctuations\r\nof as much as one-fourth more or one-fourth less (an amount of variation\r\nwhich, great as it is, is definitely known and recorded in specimens of\r\nthe skulls of human races), we get the following list of “cranial\r\ncapacities” or brain-sizes, forming a nearly unbroken series between the\r\nhighest European and the ape. The middle figure represents the normal or\r\naverage, and the first and last figure in each group the constant,\r\nthough rare, minimum and maximum. Gorilla, 350, 500, 650; Java race,\r\n675, 900, 1125; Australians, 900, 1200, 1500; Cromagnard and European,\r\n1165, 1550, 1940 (European skulls of this great capacity are known). The\r\nNeander-man skulls are left out of the above list—although the Corrèze\r\nspecimen allows of a satisfactory measurement of its capacity—for a\r\nvery curious reason, which is explained in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[9] In this connection it seems to be important to note the “Ethiopic”\r\ncharacter of the arrangement of the hair in the little carving of a\r\nwoman’s head from the Brassempouy Cave (dep. Landes), shown in Fig. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT THE NEANDER MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nSince writing what precedes I have been able more than once to gratify\r\nmy keen desire to examine the wonderful human skull from the\r\nChapelle-aux-Saints in the Corrèze (Central France). The skull has been\r\nphotographed, and an excellent figure of it is reproduced in our Fig.\r\n65. But it is one thing to look at a picture of such a specimen, and\r\nanother to take it into one’s hands and closely examine it. The skull is\r\nin the care of my friend, Professor Marcelin Boule, who is at the head\r\nof the great collection of remains of extinct animals in the Jardin des\r\nPlantes.\r\n\r\nIt has been treated by him with great skill so as to render the bone\r\nfirm and hard, whilst detached portions have been fitted into place, so\r\nthat it is fairly complete (Fig. 65). The skull was found (together with\r\nmany bones of the skeleton of the same individual) by two enthusiastic\r\nlocal archæologists buried at such depth and in such position in the\r\ncave known as the Chapelle-aux-Saints as to leave no doubt as to its\r\nbelonging to one of a race of men contemporary with the mammoth and\r\nhairy rhinoceros—a race which inhabited Europe in the great glacial\r\nperiod—called by prehistorians “the Moustierian period,” which cannot\r\nbe less than a hundred thousand years behind us, and probably is more.\r\nThe chief importance of this skull lies in the fact not only that its\r\nposition in the cave-deposits, and therefore its relative age, was\r\ncarefully ascertained, but that it agrees in its very peculiar form with\r\nthe Neanderthal skull (from the Rhineland), the Spy skulls (Belgium),\r\nand the Gibraltar skull. It, in fact, confirms the conclusion that at\r\nthis period the caves of Western Europe were inhabited by a race of men\r\nwith peculiar skulls, which may be called the Neander race in reference\r\nto the first-discovered skull of the kind. They were altogether\r\ndifferent from the Reindeer Men, or Cromagnards, who came later upon the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.—Drawing one-third the size of nature, of the\r\nleft side of the lower jaw of a modern European. Observe the small size\r\nas compared with the jaw in Figs. 80, 81, and 82, also the prominent\r\nchin: the small breadth of the up-turned ramus, and the deep bay or\r\nnotch (not seen in the other lower jaws) separating the coronoid process\r\nfrom the condyle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.—Outline (one-third the size of nature) of the\r\nskull of the Neander Man from the Chapelle-aux-Saints, with all\r\nfractures and defects made good. The bony sockets of the teeth and the\r\nteeth themselves (lost and atrophied by inflammatory disease in the\r\nactual skull) are here given their full size and healthy condition. The\r\nlower jaw is seen to be very similar to that from Heidelberg (Fig. 82).\r\nFrom a photograph taken by Professor Marcelin Boule from a cast of the\r\nactual skull. The cast was “made good” by modelling upon it the\r\ndeficient parts.]\r\n\r\nThe fact was published some four months ago that the new Corrèze skull\r\nagrees with the celebrated skull-top (called a “calvaria” by anatomists)\r\nof the Neanderthal (Fig. 76) in the extraordinary shallowness or absence\r\nof “dome,” in the retreating forehead, the thick prominent eyebrow\r\nridges, and in the excessive “lowness,” or want of elevation of the back\r\nregion. But further study of the new skull has enabled Professor Boule\r\nto show, as he demonstrated to me, that the outline of the new skull\r\nlooked at from above coincides not merely approximately, but exactly\r\nwith that of the Neanderthal skull. There is the same great length from\r\neyebrows to occiput, and the same great breadth at a series of\r\ncorresponding regions. The curious thing is that both these skulls are\r\nof enormous size—a good deal bigger in length and breadth than modern\r\nEuropean skulls, and not small and ape-like, though they are far\r\nshallower (that is, less high in the dome) than any skulls of living\r\nmen. I had, myself, always been astonished by the great breadth and\r\nlength of the casts of the Neanderthal skull which we possess in\r\nEngland, and supposed that possibly the casts were carelessly made. Now\r\nProfessor Boule shows that both the Neanderthal and the Corrèze skull\r\nare so much larger in breadth and length than average European skulls,\r\nthat in spite of its flat, depressed shape, the Corrèze skull (and\r\nconsequently the Neanderthal skull, too) has a brain-cavity holding 1600\r\ncubic centimetres, whilst the average modern European skull only holds\r\n1500 to 1550. The estimate given by former observers for the Neanderthal\r\nskull was as low as 1200. This calculation was based on the diminution\r\nof volume caused by the flatness of the skull, and would be correct were\r\nthe skull of the Neander race no longer or broader than an ordinary\r\nEuropean skull. If we imagine a skull of the ordinary European\r\nproportionate height, but as long and as broad as the Neander skulls,\r\nthen its volume would be something like 2000 cubic centimetres. This is\r\na very remarkable result. The ancient Neander Men’s brain was not\r\nsmaller, but actually a little bigger than that of modern Europeans; it\r\nwas bigger in regions where the modern European is small, and smaller\r\nwhere that is large!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.—The skull of a male chimpanzee. Drawn one-third\r\nthe natural size (linear) to compare with the human skulls and jaws here\r\nfigured. The dotted lines and the letters _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, and\r\n_f_ have the same signification as in Fig. 65, to which reference should\r\nbe made. The flatness of the cranial dome and the reduction of the\r\nfrontal boss (_d_) are very marked. So are the relatively large size of\r\nthe jaws and teeth. Compare the shape of the lower jaw with that from\r\nHeidelberg (Fig. 82), and with that of a modern European (Fig. 79).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.—The Heidelberg jaw, from a lower Pleistocene\r\ndeposit, near Heidelberg. Observe the absence of chin and the great\r\nbreadth of the up-turned part of the jaw. Compare with the lower jaws\r\ndrawn to the same scale in Figs. 79, 80, and 81. One-third the size of\r\nnature.]\r\n\r\nIf we had any sufficient knowledge of the mental qualities which belong\r\nto different regions of the brain (if, indeed, such localisation of\r\nqualities is possible), we might draw some interesting conclusions from\r\nthis difference between the two races. But unfortunately our knowledge\r\non that matter is very defective. We are not in a position to say that\r\nlength and breadth of the brain either can or cannot compensate (so to\r\nspeak) for shallowness. It is probable that the mental qualities of the\r\ntwo forms of brain were in important respects different, but that is all\r\nthat can at present be said. No accredited brain student would, until\r\nmore is known, venture to draw conclusions as to mental quality from\r\nsuch facts as mere breadth, length, and depth of the cranial cavity.\r\n\r\nThe Corrèze skull has a strongly-projecting face, depending not merely\r\non a protrusion of the dentary border of the upper jaw, but on a forward\r\nthrust of the entire face. This is not shown by the Gibraltar skull\r\n(Fig. 77). It is not improbable that this region has been flattened in\r\nthe Gibraltar skull whilst it was buried in the cave deposit and\r\nsoftened by water. The lower jaw is preserved in the new French\r\nspecimen, and is very remarkable on account of the retreating chin and\r\nthe lowness and backward flexion of the articular process, as well as\r\nfor the large size of the surface by which it articulates with the\r\nskull. All the cheek-teeth have been shed (see Fig. 65), and the sockets\r\nclosed owing to inflammation, showing that primitive European man was\r\nsubject to the same trouble with his teeth from which civilised men of\r\nto-day suffer. In comparing the skull with the skulls of modern races,\r\nProfessor Boule is not inclined to insist much on the resemblance to\r\nAustralian and Tasmanian skulls presented by the thick and large\r\nbrow-ridges. A careful study of the skull is giving to Professor Boule\r\nmany facts of importance which will be published ere long. The articular\r\nsurfaces or “condyles” of the skull (for instance) by which it was set\r\non the neck vertebræ are so set that the head must have been habitually\r\ncarried with a droop like that of an animal, and not poised upright on\r\nthe neck as in modern races of man.\r\n\r\nNot less important than the skull are some of the bones of the arm and\r\nleg. Indeed, they show more novel characters than the skull, and\r\ndefinitely distinguish the Neander Men so as to justify us in regarding\r\nthem as a distinct species, _Homo Neanderthalensis_. The thigh-bone is\r\nvery short: as compared with that of a modern European, it is as 14 to\r\n18. Also it is thick and _curved_. This was already known in the Neander\r\nMan of the Spy cave, and its confirmation by the specimen from the\r\nCorrèze establishes this shortness of the thigh as a specific character.\r\nThere are also strange features in the articulation of the bones of the\r\nthumb and of the heel which Professor Boule will make known when he\r\npublishes his full account of this most astonishing skeleton.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting here that another skull of the same race—that of a\r\nyoung individual—was dug out in 1908 at Moustier by Mr. Hauser, a Swiss\r\nexplorer. The specimen was broken into many fragments and has not been\r\nsatisfactorily put together, so that at present it is not possible to\r\nsay whether it gives any further information as to the Neander Man. Also\r\nin 1909 the French explorers have found another skull and skeleton of\r\nthe same age and race at Ferassi, near Moustier, on the Veyzere. It has\r\nbeen carefully removed, but not yet studied. The bones of the hand and\r\nof the foot are complete, and will be available for confirming the\r\nobservations made on the skeleton of the Chapelle-aux-Saints.\r\n\r\nWe have, a few pages back, noted that behind the Glacial or Moustierian\r\nperiod of the Pleistocene (the second of our list, the Reindeer period\r\nbeing the latest), geologists recognise a third or warm period which is\r\nrepresented by deeper cave-deposits and by some of the older sands,\r\nclays, and gravels of our river valleys. As in the Moustierian deposits,\r\nso in these older deposits (called “Chellean” after a French township)\r\nwe find abundant large flint implements (Figs. 73, 74) indicating the\r\npresence of man. But the animals associated with him were not the\r\nmammoth and the hairy rhinoceros; they were the _Elephas antiquus_ and a\r\ndistinct kind of rhinoceros, and most distinctively the hippopotamus.\r\nThese beds and their animal remains and worked flints occur abundantly\r\nin the South of England, and have been more or less mistaken for and\r\nconfused with the glacial Moustierian deposits which also are common in\r\nEngland. No bones or skulls of the men of this Chellean period have been\r\nfound, excepting a lower jaw, which was not long ago discovered in a\r\ndeposit of this warmer and earlier age, near Heidelberg (Fig. 82). This\r\njaw-bone is remarkably well preserved, and the great difference between\r\nit and that of a modern European may be seen by comparing our Figures 79\r\nand 82. In the absence of chin, the great breadth of the up-turned part\r\nof the jaw and the shallowness of the notch separating the condyle or\r\narticulating knob from the more forwardly placed “coronoid” process (a\r\nwell-marked triangular process in the modern European jaw), the\r\nHeidelberg jaw differs from the modern European, and resembles that of\r\nthe chimpanzee (Fig. 81).\r\n\r\nDr. Schoettensack of Heidelberg, who has described this remarkable\r\njaw-bone and has very kindly presented casts of it to the Natural\r\nHistory Museum, to Oxford, to Cambridge, and to myself, was of the\r\nopinion that it indicated a distinct race or even a distinct species of\r\nman. But Professor Marcelin Boule has found that when the lower jaw of\r\nthe skull from the Chapelle-aux-Saints is “reconstructed,” not only by\r\nreplacing the parts broken away, but by restoring the teeth and the\r\nabsorbed sockets of the teeth, it comes out very closely identical with\r\nthe Heidelberg jaw. In Fig. 80 I have reproduced the profile of\r\nProfessor Boule’s complete restoration of the “Chapelle” skull, and it\r\nwill be seen that the lower jaw differs very little from that of the\r\nHeidelberg specimen. Indeed, Professor Boule has published a photograph\r\nin which he attaches the Heidelberg lower jaw to the restored Chapelle\r\nskull in place of its own, and the similarity of the two becomes very\r\nobvious.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen by the drawings which I give here, the Heidelberg jaw\r\nis even more powerful than that of the Chapelle skull. The lower jaw of\r\na modern European (Fig. 79), drawn to the same scale as the other two,\r\nand as that of the chimpanzee (Fig. 81), is an elegant little thing with\r\nits forwardly-projecting chin, its short measurement from front to back,\r\nand the narrowness and delicacy of its up-turned part or ramus, with its\r\nwell-marked angle at the lower corner and deeply cut upper border\r\nbetween the condyle (hindermost projection with knob) and the coronoid.\r\n\r\nThe imperfect lower jaw (without teeth and with the articular condyle\r\nbroken away) of the Cromagnon skull, drawn in Fig. 75, should also be\r\ncompared: it is, though broken, similar to that of the modern European.\r\nLower jaws differ in some of the points which we have been looking at,\r\nfrom one another, but there is no known living race of men the lower jaw\r\nof which is not far nearer to that of the modern European (Fig. 79),\r\nthan to that from the Chapelle-aux-Saints or from Heidelberg (Fig. 82);\r\nand I may add that the imperfect lower jaw of the Neander-man skull,\r\nfrom the Spy Cave in Belgium, agrees in the absence of chin and in other\r\npoints with that of Heidelberg and of the Chapelle skull. There is not\r\nsufficient ground afforded by the characters of the lower jaw for\r\nconsidering that the race indicated by the Heidelberg specimen was\r\ndistinct from the Neander race, as may be seen by comparing Fig. 80 with\r\nFig. 82.\r\n\r\nAs these pages are going to press, I am able to add that I have seen in\r\nParis a very interesting and striking restoration of the appearance in\r\nthe flesh or during life of the head of the man of the Chapelle-aux-Saints,\r\ncarefully modelled in Professor Boule’s laboratory by a young sculptor,\r\nby applying his clay to a cast of the completed restoration of the\r\nskull. It is, I understand, proposed to publish this restoration firstly\r\nas strictly determined by anatomical fact and devoid of hair, and then\r\nto add the hair of the scalp, the eyebrows, eyelashes, and beard, and to\r\nplace artificial eyes in position.
