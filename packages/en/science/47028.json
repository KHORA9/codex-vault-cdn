Copies of each paper, in pamphlet form, are\r\ndistributed as published to libraries and scientific organizations and\r\nto specialists and others interested in the different subjects. The\r\ndates at which these separate papers are published are recorded in the\r\ntable of contents of each of the volumes.\r\n\r\nThe _Bulletin_, the first of which was issued in 1875, consists of a\r\nseries of separate publications comprising monographs of large\r\nzoological groups and other general systematic treatises (occasionally\r\nin several volumes), faunal works, reports of expeditions, catalogues of\r\ntype-specimens, special collections, and other material of similar\r\nnature. The majority of the volumes are octavo in size, but a quarto\r\nsize has been adopted in a few instances in which large plates were\r\nregarded as indispensable. In the _Bulletin_ series appear volumes under\r\nthe heading _Contributions from the United States National Herbarium_,\r\nin octavo form, published by the National Museum since 1902, which\r\ncontain papers relating to the botanical collections of the Museum.\r\n\r\nThe present work forms No. 142 of the _Bulletin_ series.\r\n\r\n                                               ALEXANDER WETMORE,\r\n                       _Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

of North American birds. Previous\r\nnumbers have been issued as follows:\r\n\r\n      107. Life Histories of North American Diving Birds, August 1, 1919.\r\n\r\n      113. Life Histories of North American Gulls and Terns, August 27,\r\n           1921.\r\n\r\n      121. Life Histories of North American Petrels, Pelicans and their\r\n           Allies, October 19, 1922.\r\n\r\n      126. Life Histories of North American Wild Fowl, May 25, 1923.\r\n\r\n      130. Life Histories of North American Wild Fowl, June 27, 1925.\r\n\r\n      135. Life Histories of North American Marsh Birds, \"1926.\" (=\r\n           March 11, 1927).\r\n\r\nThe same general plan has been followed, as explained in previous\r\nbulletins, and the same sources of information have been utilized.\r\n\r\nThe classification and nomenclature adopted by the American\r\nOrnithologists' Union, in its latest check list and its supplements,\r\nhave been followed, mainly, with such few changes as, in the author's\r\nopinion, will be, or should be, made to bring the work up to date, and\r\nin line with recent advances in the science.\r\n\r\nThe main ranges are as accurately outlined as limited space will permit;\r\nthe normal migrations are given in sufficient detail to indicate the\r\nusual movements of the species; no attempt has been made to give all\r\nrecords, for economy in space, and no pretense at complete perfection is\r\nclaimed. Many published records, often repeated, have been investigated\r\nand discarded; many apparently doubtful records have been verified; some\r\npublished records, impossible to either verify or disprove, have been\r\naccepted if the evidence seemed to warrant it.\r\n\r\nThe egg dates are the condensed results of a mass of records taken from\r\nthe data in a large number of the best egg collections in the country,\r\nas well as from contributed field notes and from a few published\r\nsources. They indicate the dates on which eggs have been actually found\r\nin various parts of the country, showing the earliest and latest dates\r\nand the limits between which half the dates fall, the height of the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe plumages are described only in enough detail to enable the reader to\r\ntrace the sequence of molts and plumages from birth to maturity and to\r\nrecognize the birds in the different stages and at the different\r\nseasons. No attempt has been made to fully describe adult plumages; this\r\nhas been already well done in the many manuals. The names of colors,\r\nwhen in quotation marks, are taken from Ridgway's Color Standards and\r\nNomenclature (1912) and the terms used to describe the shapes of eggs\r\nare taken from his Nomenclature of Colors (1886 edition). The\r\nheavy-faced type in the measurements of eggs indicates the four extremes\r\nof measurements.\r\n\r\nMany of those who contributed material for former volumes have rendered\r\na similar service in this case. In addition to those whose contributions\r\nhave been acknowledged previously, our thanks are due to the following\r\nnew contributors: Photographs, notes, or data have been contributed by\r\nW. B. Alexander, Clark Blickensderfer, C. E. Chapman, Karl\r\nChristofferson, C. W. Colthrup, Walter Colvin, W. M. Congreve, Joseph\r\nDixon, J. G. Gordon, S. A. Grimes, W. C. Herman, Frank Howland, W. I.\r\nLyon, T. R. Miley, D. J. Nicholson, R. H. Rauch, Russell Richardson,\r\njr., W. A. Smith, J. D. Soper, E. S. Thomas, M. B. Trautman, C. F.\r\nWalker, F. M. Weston, H. F. Witherby, A. H. Wood, jr., and C. J. Young.\r\n\r\nReceipt of material from over 250 contributors has been acknowledged in\r\nprevious volumes.\r\n\r\nThrough the courtesy of the Biological Survey, the services of Frederick\r\nC. Lincoln were secured to compile the distribution paragraphs. With the\r\nmatchless reference files of the Biological Survey at his disposal and\r\nwith some advice and help from Dr. Harry C. Oberholser, his many hours\r\nof careful and thorough work have produced results far more satisfactory\r\nthan could have been attained by the author, who claims no credit and\r\nassumes no responsibility for this part of the work. The few minor\r\nchanges made in the system do not materially alter the general plan.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles W. Townsend has written the life histories of two species\r\nand the Rev. Francis C. R. Jourdain, a well-known British authority, has\r\ncontributed the life histories and the distributions of six Old World\r\nspecies, which are known to us only as rare stragglers. Mr. J. H. Riley\r\nhas furnished descriptions and measurements of some rare eggs in the\r\nNational Museum. We are indebted to Mr. H. F. Witherby for the loan of\r\nthe valuable photographs of the knot, taken by Admiral Peary, which the\r\nauthor publishes at his own risk, without permission.\r\n\r\nAs most of the shore birds are known to us mainly, or entirely, as\r\nmigrants it has seemed desirable to describe their migrations quite\r\nfully. As it is a well-known fact that many, if not all, immature and\r\nnonbreeding shore birds remain far south of their breeding ranges all\r\nsummer it has not seemed necessary to mention this in each case. Nor\r\ndid it seem necessary to say that only one brood is raised in a season,\r\nas this is a nearly universal rule with all water birds.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript for this volume was completed in March, 1927.\r\nContributions received since then will be acknowledged later. Only\r\ninformation of great importance could be added. When this volume appears\r\ncontributions of photographs or notes relating to the gallinaceous birds\r\nshould be sent to\r\n\r\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Life Histories of_\r\n\r\n                                North American\r\n\r\n                                 Shore Birds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE HISTORIES OF NORTH AMERICAN SHORE BIRDS\r\n\r\nORDER LIMICOLAE (PART 1)\r\n\r\n\r\nBy ARTHUR CLEVELAND BENT\r\n\r\n_Of Taunton, Massachusetts_\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily PHALAROPODIDAE, Phalaropes\r\n\r\n\r\nPHALAROPUS FULICARIUS (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\nRED PHALAROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThe female red phalarope in her full nuptial plumage is, to my mind, the\r\nhandsomest, certainly the most richly colored, of the three known\r\nspecies of phalaropes. The species is cosmopolitan, with a circumpolar\r\nbreeding range; it is apparently homogeneous throughout its wide range\r\nexcept for a local race, breeding in Spitsbergen, which has been\r\nseparated and named _Phalaropus fulicarius jourdaini_ Iredale; this race\r\nis said to have paler edgings on the back, scapulars, and tertials. The\r\nspecies is commonly known abroad as the grey phalarope, an appropriate\r\nname for the bird in its winter plumage, in which it is most often seen.\r\n\r\nIt is less often seen in the United States than the other two species;\r\nits summer home is so far north that it is beyond the reach of most of\r\nus; and at other seasons it is much more pelagic than the other species,\r\nmigrating and apparently spending the winter far out on the open sea,\r\noften a hundred miles or more from land. It seldom comes ashore on the\r\nmainland except when driven in by thick weather or a severe storm. Hence\r\nit is an apparently rare bird to most of us. But in its arctic summer\r\nhome it is exceedingly abundant. Alfred M. Bailey (1925) says that \"this\r\nwas the most abundant of the shore birds at Wales, as at Wainwright,\r\nAlaska. As a person walks over the tundra there is a continual string of\r\nthose handsome birds rising from the grass.\" Again he writes:\r\n\r\n     At Whalen, near East Cape, Siberia, we saw thousands of these\r\n     beautiful little fellows on July 11. The day was very disagreeable,\r\n     with a strong wind off the ice and a drizzling rain. From the ship\r\n     we could see waves of birds rising some distance off in such dense\r\n     flocks that individuals could not be distinguished; the mass looked\r\n     like a long, thin cloud swirling before the wind; one end of the\r\n     line rose high in the air, while the other end swerved nearer to\r\n     the water. They swung about with the erratic movements and\r\n     wave-like flight so characteristic of black skimmers, now high in\r\n     the air, again low over the water. As we worked along the shore,\r\n     thousands that were feeding close along the beach rose and flew\r\n     across the sand spit in front of us. There was a continual stream\r\n     of them drifting by, like so much sand before a strong wind. They\r\n     were, at this time, beginning to molt their breeding plumage.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The migrations of the red phalarope are mainly at sea,\r\nusually far out from land. During the month of May enormous flocks may\r\nbe seen on the ocean off the coasts of New England, but it is only\r\nduring stress of weather that they are driven inshore. I can well\r\nremember a big storm, on May 21, 1892, which brought a large flight of\r\nthese birds into Cape Cod Bay; Nat Gould killed a large number that day\r\non Monomoy Island and I shot one at Plymouth Beach; others were taken at\r\nProvincetown. In pleasant weather these birds are well at home on the\r\nheaving bosom of the ocean, flying about in flocks, twisting, turning,\r\nand wheeling like flocks of sandpipers, or resting or feeding on the\r\ndrifting rafts of seaweeds. On the Pacific coast these birds are even\r\nmore abundant, if one goes far enough offshore to see them during April\r\nand May. They often congregate in considerable numbers about the\r\nFarallon Islands. W. Leon Dawson (1923) has drawn a graphic picture of\r\nthem there, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Here in late spring thousands of these birds ride at anchor in the\r\n     lee of the main island, along with other thousands of the other\r\n     northern species, _Lobipes lobatus_. Of these some few scores are\r\n     driven ashore by hunger and seek their sustenance in brackish\r\n     pools, or else battle with the breakers in the little \"bight\" of\r\n     the rocky lee shore. The date is May 23, and the company under\r\n     survey numbers a few brilliant red birds in high plumage among the\r\n     scores in unchanged gray, together with others exhibiting every\r\n     intermediate gradation. When to this variety is added a similar\r\n     diversity among the northerns, which mingle indiscriminately with\r\n     them, you have a motley company--no two birds alike. Ho! but these\r\n     are agile surfmen! Never, save in the case of the wandering tattler\r\n     and the American dipper, have I seen such absolute disregard of\r\n     danger and such instant adjustment to watery circumstance. Here are\r\n     30 of these phalaropes \"fine mixed,\" threading a narrow passage in\r\n     the reefs where danger threatens in the minutest fraction of a\r\n     second. Crash! comes a comber. Our little world is obliterated in\r\n     foam. Sea anemones and rock oysters sputter and choke, and there is\r\n     a fine fury of readjustment. But the phalaropes rise automatically,\r\n     clear the crest of the crasher, and are down again, preening their\r\n     feathers or snatching dainties with the utmost unconcern. Now a\r\n     bird is left stranded on a reef, or now he is whisked and whirled a\r\n     dozen feet away. All right, if he likes it; but if not, he is back\r\n     again, automatically, at the old rendezvous. Life goes on right\r\n     merrily in spite of these shocking interruptions. Food getting is\r\n     the main business, and this is pursued with extraordinary ardor.\r\n     The bird's tiny feet kick the water violently, and there is the\r\n     tiniest compensatory bob for every stroke, so that their little\r\n     bodies seem all a tremble. There seems to be no difference of\r\n     opinion between the two species, but there is time for a good deal\r\n     of amatory play between the sexes of the reds. It is always the\r\n     bright-colored female who makes the advances, for the wanton\r\n     phalaropes have revised nature's order, and the modest male either\r\n     seeks escape by flight, or else defends himself with determined\r\n     dabs. Here is the authentic lady for whom Shakespeare's \"pilgrim\"\r\n     sighed.\r\n\r\nOf their arrival on their breeding grounds in northern Alaska, E. W.\r\nNelson (1887) writes:\r\n\r\n     It is much more gregarious than its relative, and for a week or two\r\n     after its first arrival 50 or more flock together. These flocks\r\n     were very numerous the 1st of June, 1879, at the Yukon mouth, where\r\n     I had an excellent opportunity to observe them. In the morning the\r\n     birds which were paired could be found scattered here and there, by\r\n     twos, over the slightly flooded grassy flats. At times these pairs\r\n     would rise and fly a short distance, the female, easily known by\r\n     her bright colors and larger size, in advance, and uttering now and\r\n     then a low and musical \"clink, clink,\" sounding very much like the\r\n     noise made by lightly tapping together two small bars of steel.\r\n     When disturbed these notes were repeated oftener and became harder\r\n     and louder. A little later in the day, as their hunger became\r\n     satisfied, they began to unite into parties until 15 or 20 birds\r\n     would rise and pursue an erratic course over the flat. As they\r\n     passed swiftly along stray individuals and pairs might be seen to\r\n     spring up and join the flock. Other flocks would rise and the\r\n     smaller coalesce with the larger until from two hundred to three or\r\n     even four hundred birds were gathered in a single flock. As the\r\n     size of the flock increased its movements became more and more\r\n     irregular. At one moment they would glide straight along the\r\n     ground, then change to a wayward flight, back and forth, twisting\r\n     about with such rapidity that it was difficult to follow them with\r\n     the eye. Suddenly their course would change, and the compact flock,\r\n     as if animated by a single impulse, would rise high over head, and,\r\n     after a series of graceful and swift evolutions, come sweeping down\r\n     with a loud, rushing sound to resume their playful course near the\r\n     ground. During all their motions the entire flock moves in such\r\n     unison that the alternate flashing of the underside of their wings\r\n     and the dark color of the back, like the play of light and shade,\r\n     makes a beautiful spectacle. When wearied of their sport the flock\r\n     disbands and the birds again resume their feeding.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--The well-known reversal of sexual characters in the\r\nphalaropes makes their courtship particularly interesting, as the large,\r\nhandsome females press their ardent suits against the timid and\r\ndull-colored little males. A. L. V. Manniche (1910) has given us the\r\nbest account of it, as follows:\r\n\r\n     June 19, 1907, early in the morning, I had the pleasure of watching\r\n     for hours the actions of a loving couple of phalaropes on the beach\r\n     of a pool surrounded by large sedge tufts, covered with long,\r\n     withered grass. This act I found very funny, peculiar, and\r\n     charming. When the male had been eagerly searching for food for\r\n     some 20 minutes, often standing on his head in the water, like a\r\n     duck, to fish or pick up something from the bottom, he would lie\r\n     down on a tuft, stretching out his one leg and his one wing as if\r\n     he would fully enjoy the rest after his exertions. The female for\r\n     some moments was lying quietly and mutely in the middle of the\r\n     pool; suddenly she began with increasing rapidity to whirl around\r\n     on the surface of the water, always in the same little circle, the\r\n     diameter of which was some 10 centimeters. As the male seemed to\r\n     pay no attention to her alluring movements, she flew rapidly up to\r\n     him--producing as she left the water a peculiar whirling sound with\r\n     her wings and uttering short angry cries--pushed him with her bill,\r\n     and then she returned to the water and took up her swimming dance.\r\n     Now the male came out to her, and the two birds whirled around for\r\n     some moments equally eager and with increasing rapidity. Uttering a\r\n     short call, the female again flew to a tuft surrounded by water and\r\n     waited some seconds in vain for the male; again she flew to the\r\n     water to induce him with eager pushes and thumps to accompany her.\r\n     They again whirled violently around, whereafter she, uttering a\r\n     strong, alluring sound, flew back to the tuft, this time\r\n     accompanied by the male--and the pairing immediately took place. In\r\n     the matrimony of the grey phalarope the female only decides. She\r\n     exceeds the male in size and brilliancy of plumage and has the\r\n     decisive power in all family affairs. If she wants to shift her\r\n     place of residence she flies up swift as an arrow with a commanding\r\n     cry--which may be expressed as \"_pittss_\"--and if the male does not\r\n     follow her at once she will immediately return and give him a\r\n     severe punishment, which never fails to have the desired effect. It\r\n     is a well-known fact that she completely ignores her eggs and young\r\n     ones.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The same author describes the nesting habits of this\r\nspecies, in northeast Greenland, as follows:\r\n\r\n     It is peculiar, that the male has well-marked breeding spots before\r\n     the breeding begins and certainly before the female has laid her\r\n     first egg; but this fact has been proved by several solid\r\n     examinations. June 26, 1907, I observed on the beach of the\r\n     Bjergandeso in the Stormkap district, that the nest building was\r\n     executed by the male. He was busy in building the nest on a low\r\n     bank covered with short grass, while she paid no attention to his\r\n     labor, but swam around the beach searching food. The male shaped a\r\n     nest hollow by turning round his body against the ground on the\r\n     place selected, having first by aid of the feet scraped away and\r\n     trampled down the longest and most troublesome straws. He\r\n     diligently used feet and bill at the same time to arrange the\r\n     shorter fine straws, which are carefully bent into the nest hollow\r\n     and form the lining of this. The nest was much smaller than that of\r\n     _Tringa alpina_ and contained one egg the next day. Along the\r\n     beaches of a smaller lake not far from the ship's harbor I saw,\r\n     June 30, three solitary swimming males, at least one of which\r\n     showed signs of having a nest. I soon found this close to the place\r\n     of residence of the male in question. The nest contained four fresh\r\n     eggs and was built in exactly the same way as the before-mentioned\r\n     nest. The male proved so far from being shy, that he could be\r\n     driven to his nest and merely be caught by hand; having laid\r\n     himself upon the nest he was still more fearless.\r\n\r\n      A breeding phalarope will lie motionless with his head pressed\r\n      deep down against his back. He is almost fully covered by straws,\r\n      which surround the nest, as he with the bill bends these over\r\n      himself, besides he is so similar to the surroundings that no\r\n      human eye is able to distinguish him from these, if the spot is\r\n      not known beforehand.\r\n\r\n     July 9, 1907, I again found a phalarope's nest by the Bjergandeso;\r\n     it contained four fresh eggs and was built a little differently\r\n     from the two before-mentioned nests. These were found close to a\r\n     lake on low banks covered with short grass, but this one was built\r\n     on a tuft covered with long, withered grass, situated some 10\r\n     meters from the real lake, but surrounded by shallow water, that\r\n     came from a little river running out from the lake and irrigating\r\n     all the tufts, one of which contained the nest. This bird also kept\r\n     very close on the nest, and did not leave it before I parted the\r\n     long grass with my foot. When frightened up from the nest the bird\r\n     for a short while lay screaming and flapping on the water not far\r\n     from me; thereupon he flew away, silently and rapidly, to land on\r\n     the opposite side of the lake. Having been absent for some five\r\n     minutes he returned just as rapidly, flew a good way to the other\r\n     side of the nest, sat down, and kept quiet for a couple of minutes,\r\n     whereafter he again flew up and took the earth some 20 meters from\r\n     the nest, which he then rapidly approached walking and swimming\r\n     hidden by aquatic plants and tufts. All this was done in order to\r\n     mislead me, who was lying some 15 meters from the nest without any\r\n     shelter and therefore seen by the bird all the while.\r\n\r\nC. W. G. Eifrig (1905) found the red phalarope breeding very commonly\r\naround Cape Fullerton and Southampton Island, Hudson Bay. \"They nest\r\naround fresh water ponds, laying their eggs, without nesting material,\r\nin depressions in the sand or moss, often in lichens.\" John Murdoch\r\n(1885), on the other hand, says, at Point Barrow, Alaska, that--\r\n\r\n     The nest is always in the grass, never in the black or mossy\r\n     portions of the tundra, and usually in a pretty wet situation,\r\n     though a nest was occasionally found high and dry, in a place where\r\n     the nest of the pectoral sandpiper would be looked for. A favorite\r\n     nesting site was a narrow grassy isthmus between two of the shallow\r\n     ponds. The nest is a very slight affair of dried grass and always\r\n     well concealed.\r\n\r\nIn the Kotzebue Sound region Joseph Grinnell (1900) found three nests,\r\nof which he says:\r\n\r\n     The nests were all on higher ground and at a distance of 100 yards\r\n     or more from the lagoons where the birds usually congregated for\r\n     feeding and social purposes. The three nests agreed in situation,\r\n     being rather deep depressions sunk into the tops of mossy hummocks.\r\n     There was a thin lining of dry grasses, and in one case the\r\n     drooping blades from an adjoining clump of grass partially\r\n     concealed the nest from view from above.\r\n\r\nMiss Maud D. Haviland (1915) relates her experience with the nesting\r\nhabits of this species, at the mouth of the Yenesei River, Siberia, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     I found the first nest on Golchika Island early in July. My\r\n     attention was called to it by the male bird, which flew round\r\n     uneasily. Even when the nesting ground is invaded, this phalarope\r\n     is very quiet and not very demonstrative. He flits round the\r\n     intruder with a peculiar silent flight, rather like a big red moth,\r\n     while he utters his chirruping alarm note--\"_zhit zhit_.\" This call\r\n     is shriller than that of _Phalaropus lobatus_, and quite\r\n     recognizable where the two species breed side by side. I sat down\r\n     on a log of driftwood, and in about half an hour was able to flush\r\n     the bird from four fresh eggs. This nest, however, was not placed\r\n     very well for photography, for about 50 yards away was a turf hut,\r\n     which a Russian family had just taken possession of for the summer,\r\n     and I dared not leave the hiding tent or apparatus near the spot.\r\n     On the following day I was more fortunate, and found a nest which\r\n     was also on the island but about half a verst away. It was in\r\n     rather a dryer situation than the last, but like all the nests of\r\n     this species that I saw, the eggs lay on quite a substantial\r\n     platform of dead grass. In other cases the sites were so wet that\r\n     the bird must have been sitting actually in water--and the\r\n     photographer would have had to do likewise! In the photograph, the\r\n     grass has been parted in order to show the eggs, but before this\r\n     was done they were screened as carefully as the eggs of a redshank\r\n     or reeve.\r\n\r\n     I pitched the tent at once, and went in to hide. The male phalarope\r\n     stood on a tussock about 20 yards away and watched attentively, I\r\n     should not thus have tackled the nest of any other wader, but I\r\n     relied upon the confidence and simplicity of the phalarope, and I\r\n     did not rely upon them in vain. In about 20 minutes I caught sight\r\n     of the bird creeping round the tent, and a few minutes later he\r\n     settled down upon the eggs. In this, my first glimpse of a grey\r\n     phalarope at close quarters, two points struck me forcibly. One was\r\n     the apparent extraordinary length of the bird. The single pair of\r\n     legs in the middle seemed quite insufficient to support so long a\r\n     body, and with his quaint perky gait, it seemed as if the bird\r\n     swayed to and fro upon cee springs as he walked. The other was the\r\n     peculiar harmony of the color of the mantle with the grass around,\r\n     bleached or blackened by snow and thaw. The long, bladelike form of\r\n     the secondary feathers, and the buff longitudinal shoulder bands\r\n     seemed to emphasize the scheme until the bird was almost\r\n     indistinguishable from his surroundings.\r\n\r\nHerbert W. Brandt in his manuscript notes says:\r\n\r\n     The nest of the red phalarope is built either on dry ground or over\r\n     shallow grass-grown water and is well concealed. Leading away from\r\n     it usually are one or more runways which are either tunneled or\r\n     open. The nest is fragile and very loosely made. The interior is\r\n     moulded into a cup shape and the structure is made of grasses and\r\n     often lined with moss stems, small leaves of the dwarf birch,\r\n     cranberry, and other small, crisp leaves found there. Frequently,\r\n     however, a simple depression in the moss or grass suffices to serve\r\n     for the nursery. The range of measurements of 18 nests is: Height 3\r\n     to 5 inches; inside diameter 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 inches; depth of\r\n     cavity, 2-1/2 to 3 inches; but the nest is sometimes built up\r\n     higher and is more substantial if placed directly over water. In\r\n     fact, this little coot-footed bird sometimes builds a miniature\r\n     cootlike nest. The male alone was noted building the nest, and he\r\n     usually incubates, but on two occasions the female was observed on\r\n     the eggs. The incubating bird is not a close sitter and departs\r\n     from the nest long before the intruder arrives. In that\r\n     jaeger-haunted land when the male phalarope returns to the nest he\r\n     weaves so stealthily through the grass that it is almost impossible\r\n     to follow his devious course so that two or three rapid charges are\r\n     necessary by the watcher toward the supposed location of the nest\r\n     before the incubating bird can finally be forced to rise directly\r\n     from its eggs.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The red phalarope ordinarily lays four eggs, though three\r\nsometimes constitute a full set, and as many as six have been found in a\r\nnest, probably laid by two birds. They vary in shape from ovate pyriform\r\nto subpyriform and have a slight gloss. The prevailing ground colors\r\nrange from \"pale olive buff\" to \"dark olive buff\"; in the darker sets\r\nthey vary from \"ecru olive\" to \"Isabella color\"; in a few sets there is\r\na greenish tinge approaching \"light brownish olive\". The markings are\r\nbold, sharply defined and irregular in shape; they are most numerous\r\nand often confluent at the larger end; but some eggs are finely speckled\r\nover the entire surface. The prevailing colors of the markings are dark\r\nbrowns, from \"warm sepia\" or \"Vandyke brown\" to \"bone brown\" or \"clove\r\nbrown.\" Some eggs are marked with lighter or brighter browns, \"hazel,\"\r\n\"russet,\" or even \"tawny.\" The drab under markings are hardly\r\nnoticeable. The measurements of 148 eggs in the United States National\r\nMuseum average 31.5 by 22 millimeters; the eggs showing the four\r\nextremes measure =35= by 22, 32 by =23= and =27.5= by =20.5=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Authorities differ as to the period of incubation, which does\r\nnot seem to have been definitely determined by anyone. Mr. Conover\r\nwrites to me that \"a nest located June 10, with three eggs, hatched on\r\nJune 29.\" Incubation is performed almost wholly by the male, but Mr.\r\nBrandt (mss.) says: \"The female, however, is, of course, the dominant\r\nmember of the household, but she occasionally shares the cares of\r\nincubation, as I proved by collecting one from the nest; while later in\r\nthe year I was successful in photographing a mother with a single chick.\r\nPerhaps it was a favorite child which she was taking for a walk while\r\nthe father was mothering the rest of the family.\" Most observers agree\r\nthat the male assumes full care of the young also; but Miss Haviland\r\n(1915) says: \"It seems as if both male and female unite to care for the\r\nyoung, and when the breeding ground is approached they fly around and\r\ncall anxiously.\" Probably the gaily dressed female is a poor mother at\r\nbest and prefers to join the large flocks of her sex on the tundra\r\npools.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy young red phalarope is the handsomest of its\r\ngroup, darker and more richly colored, as well as larger than the young\r\nnorthern phalarope. The upper parts show various shades of deep, warm\r\nbrownish buff, darkest, \"Sudan brown,\" on the crown, paling to \"raw\r\nsienna,\" on the sides of the head, occiput, neck, thighs, and rump, and\r\nto \"yellow ocher\" on the rest of the upper parts; these colors shade off\r\ninto \"antimony yellow\" or \"warm buff\" on the throat and breast and to\r\nbuffy white on the belly; the down of the upper parts is tipped with\r\nblack, except on the yellow ocher parts, and is basally dusky. It is\r\nboldly marked above with clear, velvety black; there is a large black\r\npatch back of the central crown patch of brown and a diminishing black\r\nstripe on each side of it; a narrow black stripe runs from the hill,\r\nover the eye, to the auriculars; another runs across the hind neck; a\r\nbroad, but more or less broken and irregular, black stripe extends down\r\nthe center of the back and a similar stripe down each side of it; there\r\nis also a large well-defined black patch on each side of the rump, above\r\nthe thigh.\r\n\r\nIn fresh juvenal plumage, in August, the feathers of the crown, mantle,\r\nand scapulars are black, broadly edged with \"ochraceous tawny\"; the\r\ntertials, median wing coverts, upper tail coverts, and tail feathers are\r\nnarrowly edged with paler shades of buff; the lesser wing coverts are\r\nnarrowly edged with white; the forehead, lores, neck all around, upper\r\nbreast, and flanks are suffused with grayish brown, varying from \"fawn\r\ncolor\" or \"wood brown,\" on the throat, neck, and breast, to \"vinaceous\r\nbuff\" on the head and flanks; the rest of the under parts are pure\r\nwhite. The sexes are alike in juvenal and winter plumages.\r\n\r\nThe tawny edgings of the upper plumage soon fade and wear away before\r\nthe postjuvenal molt begins during August. I have seen birds in full\r\njuvenal plumage as late as September 15; the molt is usually not\r\ncompleted until late in October, but I have seen it well advanced by the\r\nmiddle of August. This molt includes nearly all of the contour plumage,\r\nbut not the wings and tail, so that first-winter birds can be\r\ndistinguished from adults by the juvenal wing coverts and tail.\r\n\r\nThe first prenuptial molt occurs mainly in April and May; it is\r\nsometimes completed by the last week in May, but more often not until\r\nearly June; I have seen the full first-winter plumage retained until May\r\n21. This molt involves the entire contour plumage, some wing coverts,\r\nand the tail; so that young birds in first nuptial plumage closely\r\nresemble adults and can be distinguished only by the presence of some\r\nold juvenal wing coverts. The sexes are quite unlike in this plumage and\r\nare probably ready to breed. Certain females, in which the black crown\r\nand white cheek patches are obscured with buff and rufous tints, but are\r\notherwise in full plumage, are perhaps young birds.\r\n\r\nAt the following molt, the first postnuptial, the adult winter plumage\r\nis acquired, characterized by the bluish-gray mantle and the white under\r\nparts. This molt is complete; it begins in July and is sometimes\r\ncompleted in August, but more often it is prolonged into September or\r\nlater. Adults have a partial molt in the spring, from March to May,\r\ninvolving the contour feathers, the tail, some of the tertials, and some\r\nof the wing coverts; the remiges are not molted, and some of the old\r\nscapulars are retained. The adult postnuptial molt, from July to\r\nDecember, is complete.\r\n\r\n_Food._--During the month or so that they are on their northern breeding\r\ngrounds the red phalaropes are shore birds, feeding in the tundra pools\r\nor along the shores, but during the rest of the year they are\r\nessentially sea birds, feeding on or about the floating masses of kelp\r\nor seaweeds, or following the whales or schools of large fish; hence\r\nthey are aptly called \"sea geese,\" \"whale birds,\" or \"bowhead birds.\"\r\nThey occasionally come in to brackish pools near the shore or rarely\r\nare seen on the sandy beaches or mud flats feeding with other shore\r\nbirds. Outlying rocky islands are often favorite feeding places. Ludwig\r\nKumlien (1879) writes:\r\n\r\n     Whalemen always watch these birds while they are wheeling around\r\n     high in the air in graceful and rapid circles, for they know that\r\n     as soon as they sight a whale blowing they start for him, and from\r\n     their elevated position they can, of course, discern one at a much\r\n     greater distance than the men in the boat I doubt if it be\r\n     altogether the marine animals brought to the surface by the whale\r\n     that they are after, for if the whale remains above the surface any\r\n     length of time they always settle on his back and hunt parasites.\r\n     One specimen was brought me by an Eskimo that he had killed on the\r\n     back of an _Orca gladiator_; the esophagus was fairly crammed with\r\n     _Laernodipodian crustaceans_, still alive, although the bird had\r\n     been killed some hours; they looked to me like _Caprella phasma_\r\n     and _Cyamus ceti_. According to the Eskimo who killed it, the birds\r\n     were picking something from the whale's back, I have often seen\r\n     them dart down among a school of _Delphinapterous leucas_ and\r\n     follow them as far as I could see. On one occasion a pair suddenly\r\n     alighted astern of my boat and were not 3 feet from me at times;\r\n     they followed directly in the wake of the boat, and seemed so\r\n     intent on picking up food that they paid no attention whatever to\r\n     us. They had probably mistaken the boat for a whale.\r\n\r\nIn northeastern Greenland, Manniche (1910) saw them hunt flying insects\r\non land; he also says:\r\n\r\n     Some 20 analyses of stomachs proved that the phalaropes in the\r\n     breeding season chiefly feed on small insects, principally gnats\r\n     and larvae of these. The esophagus and stomachs of several birds\r\n     killed were filled with larvae of gnats, which in vast multitudes\r\n     live in the fresh-water ponds. In a few stomachs I also found fine\r\n     indeterminable remnants of plants (Algae?).\r\n\r\nW. Leon Dawson (1923) describes their feeding habits at the Farallones,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     Three red phalaropes, all female I take it, although none of them\r\n     in highest plumage, and one northern, also a female, just under\r\n     \"high,\" are pasturing at my feet in a brackish pool some 20 feet\r\n     long, 10 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The waters of the pool teem\r\n     with a minute reddish crustacean (?) shaped like an ant, less than\r\n     a thirty-second of an inch in length and incredibly nimble. The\r\n     insects progress by leaps, and are visible only at the moment of\r\n     arrival. Yet these birds gobble them up one at a time with unerring\r\n     accuracy and with a rapidity which is nothing short of marvelous.\r\n     The reds work habitually at the rate of five dabs per second, i.\r\n     e., 300 a minute, while the northern, with a longer beak and a much\r\n     daintier motion, works only half as fast.\r\n\r\nThe following observation was made on a California beach by Roland C.\r\nRoss (1922):\r\n\r\n     Kelp flies seemed to satisfy its sporting instincts and hunger, and\r\n     the bird stalked them slowly and pointedly one by one. With bill\r\n     and neck outstretched and lowered in line with a fly on the sand, a\r\n     slow advance was made until with a pounce the hunt closed. If the\r\n     fly escaped, the phalarope sometimes ran after it, bill out.\r\n     Another pose interested me. On finding a kelp mass decaying and\r\n     drawing flies, the phalarope approached closely and so low that his\r\n     breast touched the ground, but the rear of the bird was high up. At\r\n     times he would remain with breast down and pick at the flies much\r\n     as a dusting fowl picks up a stray grain. Mr. L. E. Wyman reported\r\n     similar \"breast to ground\" actions of two phalaropes he saw feeding\r\n     by a kelp mass on the beach.\r\n\r\nAlexander Wetmore (1925), in his report on the food of the red\r\nphalarope, analyzed the contents of 36 stomachs, mainly from the\r\nPribilof Islands, with some from New York and Maine; they were collected\r\nfrom May to November, but mainly in August. Crustaceans made up 33.5 per\r\ncent of the food; beetles amounted to 27.3 per cent; flies formed 22.7\r\nper cent; and 6.8 per cent consisted of tiny fishes, mostly sculpins.\r\nThe food of this species therefore shows it to be harmless or neutral.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Phalaropes are active, lively birds in all their movements\r\nand they seem to be constantly on the move. They are all rapid fliers\r\nand this species is decidedly the swiftest on the wing of all three. As\r\nthe restless flocks move about over the water, their aerial evolutions\r\nare well worth watching. Lucien M. Turner, in his Labrador notes, writes\r\nthat he has seen them \"ascend to a great height in increasing circles,\r\ndarting in and out among each other and making a peculiar twitter as\r\nthey ascend. When some suitable locality is discerned these birds\r\ndescend almost perpendicularly and drop on the water as softly as a\r\nfeather.\" They are so much like sandpipers in appearance and in manner\r\nof flight that one is always surprised to see them alight on the water.\r\n\r\nPerhaps even more surprising than their peculiar marital relations are\r\ntheir aquatic habits. Their semipalmated and lobed toes are well adapted\r\nfor swimming and the thick, compact plumage of their under parts\r\nprotects them and buoys them up on the water. They float as lightly as\r\ncorks, or as freshly fallen autumn leaves on a woodland pool, swimming\r\nswiftly and whirling rapidly, undisturbed by rushing currents or by\r\nfoaming breakers. William Brewster (1925) has well described the\r\nbehavior of a red phalarope on an inland stream at Umbagog Lake, Me.; he\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     I strolled across a suspension footbridge that spans Bear River\r\n     here, a shallow stream rippling over a rocky bed scarce 50 feet in\r\n     width, beneath overhanging yellow birches and other deciduous\r\n     trees. Returning a few minutes later I had reached the middle of\r\n     the bridge when a grayish bird started directly under it and flew\r\n     off down stream for a few rods, skimming close to the water and\r\n     uttering a sharp _whit, whit_, which reminded me of the call of a\r\n     spotted sandpiper concerned for the safety of its young. Almost at\r\n     the first glance I recognized the bird as a red phalarope whose\r\n     presence in such a place surprised me greatly, of course.\r\n     Alighting, again, in the middle of the river it floated buoyantly\r\n     and stemmed the swift current with apparent ease, although avoiding\r\n     such exertion, whenever possible, by taking advantage of\r\n     backward-flowing eddies. Presently it began working around the\r\n     bases of some large boulders where it seemed to be obtaining\r\n     abundant food by pecking rapidly and incessantly at their rough\r\n     flanks, wetted by lapping waves. It also fed on the surface of the\r\n     swirling eddies, paddling about very rapidly and in devious\r\n     courses. It was most interesting to see a bird whose characteristic\r\n     haunts, at least in autumn and winter, are boundless stretches of\r\n     wind-swept ocean, thus disporting itself in a brawling mountain\r\n     stream overarched by trees. Even a water ousel could not have\r\n     appeared more perfectly at home there. Like most phalaropes this\r\n     one was tame and confiding, but whenever I approached within 20 or\r\n     25 feet, it would rise and fly on a few yards, giving the _whit_\r\n     call.\r\n\r\nOn land their movements are exceedingly rapid and graceful, though\r\nsomewhat erratic; they run about excitedly with all the restless\r\nactivity of sandpipers, nodding their heads with a pretty, dovelike\r\nmotion. At such times they are remarkably tame, unsuspicious, and gentle\r\nbirds; as they do not habitually come in contact with human beings, they\r\nare unafraid.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The vocal performances of the red phalarope are not elaborate.\r\nAs quoted above, Doctor Nelson (1887) describes its note as \"a low and\r\nmusical _clink, clink_, sounding very much like the noise made by\r\nlightly tapping together two small bars of steel.\" Mr. Brewster (1925)\r\nrefers to the note as \"an emphatic _zip, zip_, closely resembling that\r\nof Bonaparte's sandpiper ... but louder and mellower.\" Again he says:\r\n\"Once they rose and flew about the pond precisely like small sandpipers,\r\none of them uttering a peep-like _tweet_ just as it left the water.\"\r\nCharles W. Townsend (1920) saw one which \"emitted a whistle which was\r\nclear and pleasant at times, and again sharp and grating; at times the\r\nnote could be expressed as a _creak_.\"\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--In its nuptial plumage the red phalarope can be easily\r\nrecognized by its brilliant colors; the male is smaller, his colors are\r\nduller, and his breast is mixed with white. In its winter plumage, in\r\nwhich we usually see it, it is likely to be confused with the northern\r\nphalarope or the sanderling. It is larger than the former, more stockily\r\nbuilt and has a shorter, thicker bill, which is yellowish at the base.\r\nFrom the sanderling it can be distinguished by the gray markings on the\r\nhead and neck, which are mainly white in winter sanderlings, by the\r\ndarker gray of the back and by the yellow at the base of the bill.\r\nPhalaropes are usually tame enough to allow close study of these\r\ndetails. John T. Nichols suggests to me the following additional field\r\ncharacters:\r\n\r\n     This phalarope holds its gray plumage well into the spring and\r\n     adults quickly resume same when they go to sea in late summer.\r\n     Around the first of August flocks offshore are in gray and white\r\n     \"winter\" plumage, but a few birds have a peculiar pink tone\r\n     appreciable on the underparts at fair range, apt to be strongest\r\n     posteriorly, and which is diagnostic. It is caused by scattered old\r\n     red feathers overlaid by the delicate tips of new white ones. The\r\n     white wing stripe is somewhat broader in this than in the northern\r\n     phalarope and in gray plumage the upper parts are of so pale a tone\r\n     that the wing pattern appears faint, something as it does in the\r\n     piping plover. What seems to be a late summer plumage of birds of\r\n     the year, on the other hand, is less white than the corresponding\r\n     one of the northern. As the bird sits on the water the sides of its\r\n     neck, breast, and sides appear brownish (not red or pink), the only\r\n     touch of whitish it shows is on the flanks. At close range a curved\r\n     phalarope mark behind the eye is just indicated, corresponding to\r\n     the bold contrasting mark in the northern.\r\n\r\n_Enemies._--Phalaropes are not considered game birds, as they are too\r\nsmall and too seldom seen in large numbers to warrant pursuing them; so\r\nman should not be counted among their enemies. On their Arctic breeding\r\ngrounds they evidently have plenty of avian enemies, such as jaegers,\r\ngulls, and various gyrfalcons. Mr. Manniche (1910) writes:\r\n\r\n     The two phalaropes observed were evidently very much afraid of\r\n     larger waders as for instance knots. Several times I saw them rush\r\n     together in terror and lie motionless on the water with their heads\r\n     pressed down to their backs until the supposed danger--a passing\r\n     knot--was past; then they continued their meal or love-making. The\r\n     only enemy of the full-grown birds is the gyrfalcon (_Falco\r\n     gyrfalco_), which will surprise and capture them when lying on the\r\n     water. This I succeeded in observing one day in summer 1907; just\r\n     as I was observing a male phalarope, which swam along the beach of\r\n     a little clear pond hardly two paces from my feet, I suddenly heard\r\n     a strong whistling in the air and saw an old falcon, that from a\r\n     dizzy height shot like an arrow towards the surface of the water,\r\n     caught the phalarope and again rapidly rose in the air carrying the\r\n     bird in its talons. I saw the bird of prey descend and settle on\r\n     the summit of a rock near the bay in order to eat its prey. The\r\n     method, with which the falcon carried out its exploit, proved that\r\n     several phalaropes before had the same fate. The gyrfalcon can\r\n     certainly not catch a phalarope in flight.\r\n\r\nNature, however, sometimes takes her toll, as the following observation\r\non the coast of California reported by L. W. Welch (1922) will\r\nillustrate:\r\n\r\n     There was an unusual migration of red phalaropes (_Phalaropus\r\n     fulicarius_) this past fall. I saw about three hundred within an\r\n     hour on the ponds of the Long Beach Salt Works. This was October\r\n     30. There was a great mortality among them this year. Dead birds\r\n     were brought to the schools picked up by children in the streets or\r\n     elsewhere. On the ponds mentioned above, dead birds were washed up\r\n     in windrows. I could count 19 from one position and 21 from\r\n     another. I counted 75 within half an hour. The birds had no shot\r\n     holes in them, and showed no external evidences of having flown\r\n     against wires, but all the birds examined were emaciated in the\r\n     extreme.\r\n\r\nMr. Brandt in his manuscript notes writes:\r\n\r\n     I was told that the natives look upon the flesh of the red\r\n     phalarope as the greatest delicacy, and it is considered the\r\n     choicest food that can be placed before an honored guest. The\r\n     little native boys have, as their most prized mark, this red-brown\r\n     target. Inasmuch as this bird inhabits the small ponds just outside\r\n     the villages, the young hunters have always easily stalked game\r\n     available. The children begin to hunt the red phalarope as soon as\r\n     they are large enough to pull a bow string. The chase is so\r\n     alluring that the older boys in my employ could not resist the\r\n     temptation whenever presented, to grab a bow and arrow from the\r\n     youngsters, and stalk this little bird. The chase is not one sided,\r\n     however, as the phalarope is as quick as a flash, and like cupid's\r\n     arrows, many shots fail to reach their mark.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--The red phalaropes are the last of the waders to leave their\r\nArctic breeding grounds, lingering until the lakes and shores are closed\r\nwith ice, often well into October. These loiterers are all young birds;\r\nthe adults leave early and are sometimes seen off the coasts of the\r\nUnited States in July. F. S. Hersey and I collected one at Chatham,\r\nMass., on July 4, 1921; this may have been a loiterer from the spring\r\nflight, but probably it was an early fall migrant.\r\n\r\nThe fall migration is usually well out at sea, often hundreds of miles\r\nfrom land. Kumlien (1879) writes:\r\n\r\n     These birds were met with at great distances from land. The first\r\n     seen on our outward passage was on August 4, 1877, In latitude 41°\r\n     N., longitude 68° W.; here large flocks were met with. As we\r\n     proceeded northward, their numbers increased till we reached\r\n     Grinnell Bay. Off the Amitook Islands, on the Labrador coast, 200\r\n     miles from the nearest land, I saw very large flocks during a\r\n     strong gale.\r\n\r\nWilliam Palmer (1890) met with it in great abundance between Cape Sable\r\nand Cape Cod on August 30.\r\n\r\nOff the coast of California the flight begins in July or early August\r\nand continues through the fall; a few birds linger through the winter\r\nfrom Monterey southward. Throughout the great interior of North America\r\nmigration records are scattered, hardly more than casuals. It is\r\ninteresting, however, to note that Audubon (1840) saw his first birds of\r\nthis species on the Ohio River near Louisville, Kentucky, where he\r\nkilled 17 at one shot. I have an adult male in my collection which was\r\nshot on the Taunton River, near my home, on August 12, 1913.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Our knowledge of the winter home of our American birds of\r\nthis species is rather meager. They have been traced as far south as the\r\nFalkland Islands in the Atlantic Ocean and Juan Fernandez in the\r\nPacific. Probably they are scattered over the warmer portions of both\r\noceans, wherever they can find an abundant food supply.\r\n\r\nA number of phalaropes, almost certainly of this species, were observed\r\nby Mr. Nichols in the Atlantic, off Cape Lookout, March 22, 1926. \"They\r\nmay winter here or, what is equally likely, arrive in spring to find the\r\nsame feed which attracts the mackerel to the capes of the Carolinas in\r\nMarch or April.\"\r\n\r\nAretas A. Saunders writes to me of a similar observation made by him off\r\nthe coast of South Carolina on March 5, 1908:\r\n\r\n     That day red phalaropes were abundant on the water, though we were\r\n     out of sight of land. The sea was calm with a glossy surface, but a\r\n     slight swell and flocks of from 10 to 50 birds rose from in front\r\n     of the boat, at intervals all morning. They flew in compact flocks,\r\n     low over the water, and alighted again when some distance away.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Arctic regions of both Old and New Worlds; south in winter to\r\nSouth Africa, India, China, and southern South America.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--In the Old World the red phalarope breeds on the\r\nArctic coast from Iceland east to Nova Zembla, the Taimur Peninsula, and\r\nthe islands and coast of Siberia to Bering Sea. The race, _jourdaini_,\r\nbreeds in Spitsbergen, Iceland, and eastern Greenland.\r\n\r\nIn the Western Hemisphere the breeding range extends north to Alaska\r\n(probably St. Lawrence Island, Cape Prince of Wales, Cape Lowenstern,\r\nPoint Barrow, and the Colville delta); Mackenzie (Rendezvous Lake and\r\nFranklin Bay); northern Franklin (Bay of Mercy, Winter Harbor, and Cape\r\nLiverpool); Grinnell Island (Fort Conger); and Greenland (Disco Bay,\r\nGodhavn, and probably Christianshaab). East to Greenland (Stormkap and\r\nprobably Christianshaab); eastern Franklin (Exeter Sound, probably\r\nNugumeute and Grinnell Bay); and Ungava (Port Burwell). South to Ungava\r\n(Port Burwell and probably Prince of Wales Sound); southern Franklin\r\n(Southampton Island and Cape Fullerton); and Alaska (Fort Egbert and\r\nHooper Bay). West to Alaska (Hooper Bay, St. Michael, and probably St.\r\nLawrence Island).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--In the Eastern Hemisphere the winter range of the red\r\nphalarope seems to be principally at sea off the southern coast of\r\nArabia and the west coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nAt this season in the Western Hemisphere it has been taken or observed\r\nnorth to Lower California (La Paz and Cape San Lucas); off the coast of\r\nSouthern California (Point Pinos, Santa Cruz Islands, Anacapa Island,\r\nand San Diego); Alabama (Pickett Springs); Florida (Canaveral Light);\r\nand South Carolina (Mount Pleasant); and south to southern South America\r\n(Falkland Islands, Patagonia, and Chile).\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--Early dates of arrival in North America are: North\r\nCarolina, Cape Lookout, May 29; Delaware, seen off the coast, May 9; New\r\nJersey, Cape May, May 3, and Ocean City, May 6; New York, Shelter\r\nIsland, March 25, and Montauk Point, April 30; Connecticut, Bridgeport,\r\nMay 30; Massachusetts, Gloucester, April 2; Maine, York Beach, May 8;\r\nNova Scotia, Halifax, June 10; Quebec, Prince of Wales Sound, May 31;\r\nWashington, Destruction Island lighthouse, May 8; and Alaska, Cape\r\nConstantine, May 15, Kodiak Island, May 16, near Kotlik, May 28, Prince\r\nFrederick Sound, May 29, and Point Barrow, June 3.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--Late dates of departure in the fall are: Alaska,\r\nChatham Straits, September 9, Becharof Lake, October 6, Point Barrow,\r\nOctober 10, St. Michael, October 14, and Kodiak Island, November 4;\r\nWashington, Ilwaco, November 9, and Shoalwater Bay, November 24;\r\nCalifornia, Berkeley, October 27, Point Reyes, November 22, and Santa\r\nBarbara, November 30; Labrador, West Ste.

Its breeding range\r\nis circumpolar, but extends much farther south than that of the red\r\nphalarope; it might be called sub-Arctic rather than Arctic. There seems\r\nto be only one homogeneous species around the world. It resembles the\r\nred phalarope in its habits, but is more often seen on inland waters\r\nthan is that species.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--Countless thousands of these dainty little birds migrate\r\nnorthward off both coasts of North America in May, but very few ever\r\ncome ashore except in bad weather. While cruising off the coast, 10 or\r\nmore miles from land, one is likely to see them flying about in flocks,\r\nafter the manner of small sandpipers, flitting about and alighting on\r\ndrifting masses of seaweed or other flotsam, or swimming lightly on the\r\nsmooth surface of the sea, darting hither and thither in a most erratic\r\nway, each seemingly intent on gathering its tiny bits of food. They are\r\ngentle, graceful, and charming little birds and well worth watching.\r\n\r\nThere is also a heavy northward migration through the interior during\r\nMay. In Saskatchewan I saw a large flock at Quill Lake on May 28, 1917;\r\nand in the Crane Lake region we recorded it as an abundant migrant; it\r\nwas seen migrating, on May 29, 1905, in large flocks with sanderlings;\r\none was seen at Hay Lake on June 15; and two were taken on June 14,\r\n1906, at Big Stick Lake, which were in breeding condition. C. G. Harrold\r\nwrites to me that it is a common and rather late migrant in Manitoba.\r\nWilliam Rowan's notes contain several references to the enormous flocks\r\nwhich pass Beaverhill Lake, Alberta, in May, mostly during the last two\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nDr. E. W. Nelson (1887) has given us the following attractive account of\r\nthe arrival of these birds in northern Alaska:\r\n\r\n     As summer approaches on the Arctic shores and coast of Bering Sea\r\n     the numberless pools, until now hidden under a snowy covering,\r\n     become bordered or covered with water; the mud about their edges\r\n     begins to soften, and through the water the melting ice in the\r\n     bottom looks pale green. The ducks and geese fill the air with\r\n     their loud resounding cries, and the rapid wing strokes of arriving\r\n     and departing flocks add a heavy bass to the chorus which greets\r\n     the opening of another glad season in the wilds of the cheerless\r\n     north. Amid this loud-tongued multitude suddenly appears the\r\n     graceful, fairylike form of the northern phalarope. Perhaps, as the\r\n     hunter sits by the border of a secluded pool still half covered\r\n     with snow and ice, a pair of slight wings flit before him, and\r\n     there, riding on the water, scarcely making a ripple, floats this\r\n     charming and elegant bird. It glides hither and thither on the\r\n     water, apparently drifted by its fancy, and skims about the pool\r\n     like an autumn leaf wafted before the playful zephyrs on some\r\n     embosomed lakelet in the forest. The delicate tints and slender\r\n     fragile form, combining grace of color and outline with a\r\n     peculiarly dainty elegance of motion, render this the most lovely\r\n     and attractive among its handsome congeners.\r\n\r\n      The first arrivals reach St. Michaels in full plumage from May 14\r\n      to 15, and their number is steadily augmented, until, the last few\r\n      days of May and 1st of June, they are on hand in full force and\r\n      ready to set about the season's cares. Every pool now has from one\r\n      to several pairs of these birds gliding in restless zigzag motion\r\n      around its border, the slender necks at times darting quickly\r\n      right or left as the bright black eyes catch sight of some minute\r\n      particle of food. They may be watched with pleasure for hours, and\r\n      present a picture of exquisite gentleness which renders them an\r\n      unfailing source of interest. The female of this bird, as is the\r\n      case with the two allied species, is much more richly colored than\r\n      the male and possesses all the \"rights\" demanded by the most\r\n      radical reformers.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--The same gifted writer goes on to say:\r\n\r\n     As the season comes on when the flames of love mount high, the\r\n     dull-colored male moves about the pool, apparently heedless of the\r\n     surrounding fair ones. Such stoical indifference usually appears\r\n     too much for the feelings of some of the fair ones to bear. A\r\n     female coyly glides close to him and bows her head in pretty\r\n     submissiveness, but he turns away, pecks at a bit of food and moves\r\n     off; she follows and he quickens his speed, but in vain; he is her\r\n     choice, and she proudly arches her neck and in mazy circles passes\r\n     and repasses close before the harassed bachelor. He turns his\r\n     breast first to one side, then to the other, as though to escape,\r\n     but there is his gentle wooer ever pressing her suit before him.\r\n     Frequently he takes flight to another part of the pool, all to no\r\n     purpose. If with affected indifference he tries to feed, she swims\r\n     along side by side, almost touching him, and at intervals rises on\r\n     wing above him and, poised a foot or two over his back, makes a\r\n     half dozen quick, sharp wing strokes, producing a series of sharp,\r\n     whistling noises in rapid succession. In the course of time it is\r\n     said that water will wear the hardest rock, and it is certain that\r\n     time and importunity have their full effect upon the male of this\r\n     phalarope, and soon all are comfortably married, while mater\r\n     familias no longer needs to use her seductive ways and charming\r\n     blandishments to draw his notice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Audrey Gordon (1921) made some interesting observations on the\r\ncourtship of the red-necked phalarope, as this species is called abroad;\r\nshe writes of her experiences in the Hebrides:\r\n\r\n     Three pairs were apparently in process of courting and their\r\n     behavior was most interesting. Both cocks and hens were swimming in\r\n     the water near the shore or in pools among the rushes. Suddenly a\r\n     hen would raise herself in the water and flutter her wings at a\r\n     great pace with her head held down and neck outstretched, all the\r\n     while uttering a curious harsh call. She would then pursue the cock\r\n     rapidly through the water for a few yards as though trying to\r\n     attract his attention. At times the cock rose from the water and\r\n     flew round about the pool where the hen was, with a low erratic\r\n     flight and very slow wing beats, calling as he flew. This display\r\n     only lasted a minute, when he would again alight on the water. Once\r\n     after this flight the hen followed him closely and he turned and\r\n     seemed to be about to mate her, but she would not let him. I saw no\r\n     more on this occasion, but on June 18 I watched two hens and one\r\n     cock in a pool. One of the hens kept close to the cock and whenever\r\n     the other hen came nearer she would chase her away. Both the cock\r\n     and the hen were seen to stand up in the water and flutter their\r\n     wings as described above. The cock seemed to pay little attention\r\n     to the hens and was busy pursuing, and picking up off the water,\r\n     large black flies. Then, without any warning or unusual excitement\r\n     on the part of either cock or hen, the nearest one to the cock\r\n     suddenly put her head low down in the water with neck outstretched\r\n     and made a curious single note. The cock at once swam to her and\r\n     mating took place, the hen being submerged in the water except for\r\n     her beautiful red neck. The cock fluttered his wings all the time;\r\n     he then went ashore into the grasses. The second hen still kept in\r\n     the neighborhood, though I imagine she must have realized she had\r\n     lost her chance of a mate.\r\n\r\nP. H. Bahr (1907) throws some light on the peculiar sexual relations of\r\nthis species; he says:\r\n\r\n     On the 5th of June we watched the phenomena of polygamy, and of\r\n     attempted polyandry in this species. At one end of the loch the\r\n     former condition held sway, two energetic and quarrelsome females\r\n     having attached themselves to one miserable-looking male, and it\r\n     was ludicrous to behold the awe in which he held them. Once in\r\n     particular he nearly swam between my legs in his efforts to avoid\r\n     their attentions. Till our departure on the 27th, these three birds\r\n     were constantly to be seen together. At the other end of the loch\r\n     two males were seen continuously circling round the head of a\r\n     female. I frequently observed the male performing evolutions, which\r\n     I have previously described as the \"marriage flight.\" Zigzagging\r\n     from side to side with amazing rapidity he would hover with\r\n     dangling legs over the head of the female, who, circling placidly\r\n     in the water, appeared to take no notice of his attentions. Then\r\n     settling beside her he would peck and chase her as if endeavoring\r\n     to make her take to flight. Failing in this he would dash off once\r\n     more across the marsh uttering a warbling sort of song much like\r\n     that of the ringed plover. Then he would settle in a reedy spot,\r\n     such as would be chosen for the nesting site, and would call\r\n     vigorously, looking always in the direction of the female, as if\r\n     expecting her to follow. I observed several pairs, behaving in this\r\n     manner, and such was their fervor that the males continued this\r\n     performance even in the midst of one of the worst storms we\r\n     experienced. Often the female would resent these attentions, and a\r\n     pitched battle would ensue.\r\n\r\nHerbert W. Brandt (mss.) writes:\r\n\r\n     It is very interesting to watch a struggle between two female\r\n     northern phalaropes over a solitary male. They fight by the hour,\r\n     not after the manner of the males, which rush at each other and\r\n     boldly lock in a mortal combat, but rather these females fight by\r\n     flipping their wings and pecking at each other instead of laying\r\n     hold with determination. This can be likened only to a feminine\r\n     hair-pulling episode. One day I watched such a combat for an hour,\r\n     and there were numerous occasions on which I thought that one of\r\n     the birds would succumb; but the contest seemed to be very equal,\r\n     and when a bird recovered from a hard onslaught it would return at\r\n     once and take up the wing sparring. They would flutter here and\r\n     there over the ground, first one then the other attacking, closely\r\n     followed all the time by the shy but neutral male, the prize of the\r\n     conflict. Natives informed me that they had never known of one's\r\n     being killed by the other, but that the birds would fight all day\r\n     long.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--My personal experience with the nesting habits of the\r\nnorthern phalarope has been limited to what few nests we found in the\r\nAleutian Islands in 1911. These birds were very scarce or entirely\r\nabsent in the eastern half of the chain. We saw a few on Atka Island\r\nwhere several nests, with fresh eggs or incomplete sets, were found on\r\nJune 18. On Kiska Island they were really abundant and we found them\r\nbreeding about the small grassy ponds and wet meadows; fresh eggs were\r\nfound on June 21. Their favorite resorts all through the western part\r\nof the chain were the wetter portions of the flat alluvial plains, near\r\nthe mouths of the streams and about the marshy ponds. They were very\r\ntame everywhere and, about the ponds where they were breeding, they were\r\nvery solicitous and noisy. Their simple nests were merely deep, little\r\nhollows, lined with a few bits of grass, in the little mounds or\r\ntussocks in the wet meadows around the borders of the ponds or near the\r\nsmall streams.\r\n\r\nF. S. Hersey collected several sets of eggs for me near St. Michael,\r\nAlaska, in 1914 and 1915; most of the nests were in rather wet\r\nsituations on the tundra, in or near marshy places, rather poorly\r\nconcealed and scantily lined with grasses; others were well hidden in\r\nthe clumps of scanty grass, or deeply sunken into the tundra mosses and\r\nlined with bits of leaves or well lined with grasses. Other observers\r\nhave described the nesting habits of this species substantially as\r\nindicated above, except that Henry H. Slater (1898), who has\r\n\"encountered 45 nests with eggs in them in one day, and considerably\r\nmore than a hundred altogether\", describes the nest as \"a deep\r\ncomfortable cup, concealed in a tuft of grass, or under a trailing\r\nbranch of some dwarf Arctic shrub.\"\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The northern phalarope lays four eggs almost invariably, rarely\r\nthree eggs constitute a second set; as many as five and even seven eggs\r\nhave been found in a nest, the largest number being the product of two\r\nfemales. The eggs vary in shape from subpyriform to ovate pyriform, are\r\nslightly glossy and are very fragile. The prevalent ground colors range\r\nfrom \"pale olive buff\" to \"dark olive buff\" or \"ecru olive;\" \"olive\r\nbuff\" seems to be the commonest shade. In richly colored sets the colors\r\nrange from \"Isabella color,\" or \"Dresden brown\" to \"buckthorn brown;\"\r\nand in light buffy sets from \"cream buff\" to \"cream color.\" The size,\r\ntype, and arrangement of markings vary greatly in endless patterns. Some\r\neggs, perhaps only one in a set, are evenly covered with small spots or\r\ndots, but more often these are mixed with larger, irregular spots or\r\nblotches. Some eggs are boldly marked with large irregular blotches. The\r\ncolors of the markings range from \"sepia,\" or \"warm sepia,\" and \"bister\"\r\nto deep blackish brown, depending on the depth of the pigment. The\r\nunderlying spots, in various drab shades, are small, inconspicuous and\r\nnot numerous. In my series of over 50 sets there are two abnormal eggs;\r\none is plain bluish white and unmarked; and another is similar except\r\nfor one large blotch of \"sepia\" covering the large end. The measurements\r\nof 119 eggs, in the United States National Museum, average 29 by 20\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =33= by 21, 28\r\nby =22.5=, =27= by 19, and 31 by =18.5= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation does not seem to be definitely known,\r\nbut probably it is not far from 21 days. A set of four eggs found by H.\r\nB. Conover on June 10 hatched on the evening of June 30. Incubation is\r\nperformed largely, but perhaps not wholly, by the male. H. H. Slater\r\n(1898) writes:\r\n\r\n     Jerdon asserts that the females (of all the phalaropes presumably)\r\n     leave the care of the nests to the males and lead a club life in\r\n     separate flocks. In the present species I have not found the sex to\r\n     be so much \"emancipated.\" I have never shot the red-necked\r\n     phalarope off the nest, often as I have had a chance to do so, nor\r\n     have I seen bare hatching spots on the breasts of either sex. I\r\n     have no doubt that the males are the most attentive parents, but in\r\n     the case of isolated nests the second bird makes its appearance\r\n     before you have been there long, and I have repeatedly seen both\r\n     with the young. In fact, I should have said that of all the birds I\r\n     know the present species is the most connubial, and the mutual\r\n     devotion of a pair is a most charming thing to see--in fact, quite\r\n     touching. When not actively employed they treat themselves, and one\r\n     another, to all manner of pretty and playful endearments.\r\n\r\nHugh S. Gladstone (1907) says:\r\n\r\n     Incubation is performed mostly, if not entirely, by the male. I\r\n     flushed females off nests on two occasions, but in one case the\r\n     full complement of eggs was not yet laid, and in the other I think\r\n     they were only newly laid. The ground color of the eggs varied from\r\n     stone to olive, and in one nest all four eggs were remarkably\r\n     rotund. They take some 18 days to hatch, and only one brood is\r\n     hatched in the season, though if the first sitting is destroyed the\r\n     bird will lay again. The nestlings, although they can not fly for\r\n     some days, are wonderfully precocious and can swim immediately.\r\n     Their beautiful golden downy plumage becomes paler and paler, even\r\n     after the first 24 hours.\r\n\r\n     When the nest contains eggs the female bird shows the greatest\r\n     anxiety. She can be seen swimming about in the pools; or, rising\r\n     without any splash, flying up and down quite close to one,\r\n     uttering a low cry of \"_plip, plip_,\" varied by a hoarse\r\n     \"_chiss-ick_.\" This cry warns the male, which never flies off the\r\n     nest, but always creeps through the grass and rushes, to some\r\n     pool, near one of which the nest is invariably placed. Here he\r\n     will soon be joined by the female, and they will swim about trying\r\n     to hide their anxiety by preening their feathers or pretending to\r\n     feed.\r\n\r\nSome observers have said that the young do not take to the water until\r\nthey are fully fledged, but Mr. Hersey's notes say that: \"They run\r\nlightly over the beaten down masses of grass around the tundra ponds and\r\nwhen they know they are discovered take to the water and swim as well as\r\ntheir parents.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Nelson (1887) writes:\r\n\r\n     Fresh eggs are rarely found after June 20th, and by the middle to\r\n     20th of July the young are fledged and on the wing. By the 12th to\r\n     15th of July a few of the ashy feathers of the autumnal plumage\r\n     appear, and soon after old and young begin to gather in parties of\r\n     from five to a hundred or more, and seek the edges of large ponds\r\n     and flats or the muddy parts of the coast and borders of tide\r\n     creeks. During August and September they are found on the bays, and\r\n     the last are seen about the last of September or first of October.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The general color pattern of the downy young northern\r\nphalarope is similar to that of the red phalarope, but it differs in\r\nsome details and the colors are lighter and more yellowish above. The\r\ncolors vary from \"ochraceous tawny,\" on the crown and rump, to \"antimony\r\nyellow,\" on the rest of the upper parts, and to \"Naples yellow\" on the\r\nthroat. The underparts are more extensively grayish white than in the\r\npreceding species and there is considerable whitish between the black\r\nstripes on the back. There is more black in the crown, which is nearly\r\nsurrounded by it, and the black terminates in a point on the nape. A\r\nvery narrow black line runs from the bill to the eye; and there is a\r\nblack auricular patch. The central black stripe on the back is broad,\r\nbut the side stripes are narrow, and there are extensive black patches\r\non thighs and wings.\r\n\r\nI have seen no specimens showing the progress of development of the\r\njuvenal plumage. In the full juvenal plumage in August, the crown,\r\nocciput, and a space around the eye are black, the former faintly\r\nmottled with buff; the remainder of the head, throat, and under parts\r\nare white, more or less suffused with \"light cinnamon drab\" and gray on\r\nthe sides of the neck, breast, and flanks; the feathers of the back and\r\nscapulars are brownish black, broadly edged with bright \"ochraceous\r\ntawny,\" which gradually fades; some of the tertials are narrowly edged\r\nwith the same color; the median and inner greater wing coverts and the\r\ncentral tail feathers are narrowly edged with pale buff or white.\r\n\r\nA partial molt of the body plumage in September and October produces the\r\nfirst winter plumage, which is like that of the winter adult, except\r\nthat the juvenal wings are retained. The sexes are alike in the juvenal\r\nand all winter plumages. A partial prenuptial molt, from February to\r\nJune, involving the body plumage, some of the wing coverts and scapulars\r\nand the tail, produces the first nuptial plumage, in which the sexes\r\ndiffer, and which is nearly, if not quite, indistinguishable from that\r\nof the adult.\r\n\r\nAdults have a complete molt from July to October and an incomplete molt\r\nfrom February to June, similar to that of the young bird, producing the\r\ndistinct and well-known winter and nuptial plumages.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The northern phalarope obtains most of its food in the water,\r\non the ocean or in bays or in brackish pools or in fresh-water ponds.\r\nIts characteristic and best-known method of feeding, on which many\r\nobservers have commented, is to swim rapidly about in a small circle or\r\nto spin around in one spot, by alternate strokes of its lobed feet; this\r\nquick whirling action is supposed to stir up the minute forms of animal\r\nlife on which it feeds and bring them within reach of its needlelike\r\nbill, which it jabs into the water two or three times during each\r\nrevolution; the spinning motion is often very rapid and sometimes quite\r\nprolonged, a curious performance to watch. We saw this many times in the\r\nAleutian Islands where small flocks were constantly seen spinning around\r\nabout the old piers or feeding in the surf off the beaches where they\r\nfloated buoyantly over the little waves or fluttered over the crests of\r\nthe small breakers.\r\n\r\nWilliam Brewster (1925) describes an interesting feeding performance, at\r\nUmbagog Lake, Maine, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Alighting again, about 100 yards off, it began fluttering about in\r\n     circles, now narrowly clearing the water for a yard or two, next\r\n     hitting against or skittering over the surface, acting indeed, for\r\n     all the world like some enfeebled butterfly or clumsy moth,\r\n     alternately attracted and repelled by a forest pool lying in deep\r\n     shadow. This singular performance was occasionally varied by more\r\n     pronounced upward flights, extending to a height of several feet,\r\n     and apparently undertaken in pursuit of flying insects, passing\r\n     overhead.\r\n\r\nBoth the northern and the red phalaropes feed in large numbers at sea,\r\noften being associated together; their favorite feeding places are in\r\nthe tide rips, on or around floating masses of seaweed, in the vicinity\r\nof whales or near schools of fish. George H. Mackay (1894) writes:\r\n\r\n     On May 25, 1894, about 10,000 (as carefully estimated) were\r\n     observed resting on the water around the \"pigs\" (rocks lying off\r\n     Swampscott), occupying an area of about a mile radius. They were\r\n     feeding on the red whale bait (brit) some of which was taken from\r\n     them. I am informed that these birds follow the mackerel, which\r\n     also feed on this brit, by their pursuit of which it is driven to\r\n     the surface, and is then obtainable by the birds. I am also told\r\n     that in the Bay of Fundy the phalaropes so frighten the mackerel\r\n     when they come to the surface in pursuit of the brit, that the fish\r\n     sink themselves. To prevent this, the fishermen carry at times\r\n     quantities of liver cut up, which they throw out to attract these\r\n     birds and keep them away from the fish in order that they may be\r\n     better able to capture the latter.\r\n\r\nDr. Alexander Wetmore (1925), in his report on the food of the northern\r\nphalarope, gives the results of the examination of 155 stomachs,\r\ncollected in Alaska and in the United States, from May to October,\r\ninclusive; flies and the larvae of mosquitoes were the largest element,\r\n32.8 per cent; the true bugs (_Hemiptera_) came next, 31.8 per cent,\r\nincluding water boatmen and back swimmers; beetles represented 16.5 and\r\ncrustaceans 9.3 per cent; the remainder contained dragonfly nymphs,\r\nspiders, marine worms, small mollusks, a few small fishes and a few\r\nseeds. Various other insects and their larvae, many of which are\r\ninjurious, are included in the food of this bird.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--In flight these phalaropes remind one of the smaller\r\nsandpipers; their flight is swift and often erratic; when flying in\r\nflocks they twist and turn and wheel back and forth like a flock of\r\npeeps, flashing white or dark gray, as breasts or backs are turned\r\ntoward the observer. Mr. Brewster (1883) has seen them pitch \"down from\r\na considerable height with closed wings, much as snipe will do under\r\nsimilar circumstances.\" Again he (1925) speaks of seeing one \"rise\r\nabruptly to a height of 15 or 20 feet, and poise there for a moment,\r\nbeating its wings and shaking its tail in a violent and peculiar\r\nmanner.\"\r\n\r\nIt is while swimming on smooth water that the northern phalarope seems\r\nmost at home, most graceful, charming, and confiding; it is usually very\r\ntame and easily approached, but sometimes, especially when in large\r\nflocks, it seems to be afraid of a boat and keeps beyond gun range. It\r\nswims lightly as a cork, its thick coat of breast feathers giving it\r\ngreat buoyancy, its head is held high and carried with a graceful\r\nnodding motion. When a flock alights on the water, the individuals soon\r\nscatter and swim about rapidly and independently in zigzag lines or\r\ncircles, jabbing their bills into the water in a nervous and excited\r\nmanner. I have never seen them dive and doubt if they can do so, as they\r\nseem to have great difficulty in getting under water, even to bathe.\r\nThey frequently alight on floating masses of seaweed, where they run\r\nabout and feed with all the nervous activity of small sandpipers on a\r\nmud flat. Roland C. Ross (1924) made some interesting observations in\r\nsouthern California; he writes:\r\n\r\n     \"The northern phalarope is quite fearless in this region, but\r\n     seldom does one find the birds so confiding as in the following\r\n     instance: Mr. Ray Francisco, the warden for the gun club on this\r\n     marsh, was working in water a foot or two deep, pulling out sedges,\r\n     dock, and arrow-weed. The northern phalaropes took an interest in\r\n     this roiled up water and drew close to dab at the surface and\r\n     \"whirligig\" about in their unique way. As the man kept at work they\r\n     drew nearer until actually about his feet. They stayed with him\r\n     until he stopped work in that section. They were observed sleeping\r\n     on land and water, bill along the back under a wing. Their\r\n     ablutions were absurd attempts to get a swanlike breast and neck\r\n     under water, when such airy grace and buoyancy forbade any\r\n     subaquatic ventures. To get the proper ducking the phalarope\r\n     stretches up and drives his pretty head and breast down in the\r\n     water, which effort promptly forces his tail end up; whereupon like\r\n     a cork he rebounds, to ride high and dry above the water with\r\n     hardly a sign of moisture on the close-fitting plumage. At once he\r\n     jerks up and ducks again, and again, all to little avail,\r\n     seemingly. This up-jerk and ducking motion can be observed at a\r\n     good distance, and the birds may be identified by it.\"\r\n\r\nA curious little incident, observed in the Hebrides by Misses Best and\r\nHaviland (1914), is thus described:\r\n\r\n     On the south side of the loch, just where we had seen the pair of\r\n     birds on our previous visit, we found a male and female in the long\r\n     herbage at the water side. Perhaps we ought to reverse the usual\r\n     order and say female and male, for the traditional dominance of the\r\n     masculine sex is entirely unknown in this species. Certainly this\r\n     cock bird was a most henpecked little fowl. Possibly he had been\r\n     captured immediately on his arrival from the sea. At any rate, he\r\n     was apparently tired out, and whenever the hen stopped, as she\r\n     frequently did, to preen herself or feed, he sat down where he was,\r\n     and tucking his bill under his feathers, went to sleep. Before he\r\n     had dozed for more than a minute, however, the female would peck\r\n     him awake, and, calling querulously, force him to follow her while\r\n     she led the way through the marsh. Now and then she flew at him and\r\n     chased him about, as if losing patience. This little scene was\r\n     repeated three or four times, and the birds were so confiding that\r\n     we were able to photograph them in the act.\r\n\r\nAretas A. Saunders writes to me:\r\n\r\n     I watched flocks of these birds on a small pond near the Priest\r\n     Butte Lakes, in Seton County, Mont. They flew to the pond in a\r\n     compact flock, scattered over the pond to feed, and evidently\r\n     gathered insects from the surface of the water. When frightened by\r\n     the approach of a marsh hawk the birds all rose, quickly formed the\r\n     compact flock and flew away, returning later when the hawk had\r\n     gone.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The vocal performances of this little phalarope are not\r\nelaborate or striking. As it rises from the water it utters a plaintive\r\nand rather faint twittering note of one, two or three syllables, which\r\nhas been variously noted as _tchip_, or _tchep_, or _pe-et_, or _pleep_,\r\nor _wit_, _wit_, or _quet_, _quet_. Charles W. Townsend (1920) says that\r\nit has a variety of notes. At times it twitters like a barn swallow, at\r\ntimes it emits a single harsh note like that of the eave swallow. Again\r\na gentle _ee-ep_ is emitted, or a sharp _quip_. According to Witherby's\r\nHandbook (1920), \"Gladstone describes alarm note as a hoarse\r\n_chiss-ick_, and Aplin speaks of a short _quit_, a rapid _ket-ket_,\r\n_ket-ket_. and _chirra-chirra-chirra_ at nesting places.\"\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The northern is the smallest of the three phalaropes. It\r\nis the one most likely to be seen on inland ponds, except where the\r\nWilson phalarope is common; but the latter is much larger and lighter\r\ncolored, especially in fall and winter. The best field marks are small\r\nsize, small head, slender neck and needlelike bill. The upper parts are\r\nblackish or dark gray (not pearly gray, as in the others) and in flight\r\na white stripe shows conspicuously near the posterior border of the\r\nwing.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Northern phalaropes are very abundant during August and\r\nSeptember off the coasts of New England, but they seldom come near\r\nshore, except in severe storms. The main migration route is so far off\r\nshore, south of Cape Cod, that these birds are seldom seen in the\r\nAtlantic coast south of New England.\r\n\r\nThere is a heavy fall migration throughout the interior, which begins\r\nquite early. We found them abundant on both migrations in Saskatchewan\r\nand Alberta. After I left, Dr. L. B. Bishop saw a flock of 100 at Many\r\nIsland Lake, Alberta, on July 13, 1905, the beginning of the fall\r\nmigration; they were still more abundant at Big Stick Lake,\r\nSaskatchewan, on the 19th; nearly all of the birds taken on these two\r\ndates were adult females; many males were probably still tending broods\r\nof young. A. G. Lawrence writes to me that these birds are fairly common\r\ntransients in southern Manitoba, from August 15 to the end of September.\r\n\r\nH. L. Stoddard (1923) has published the following note:\r\n\r\n     Occasionally in August and September of past years large flocks of\r\n     small shore birds have been seen a long way offshore in the\r\n     sand-dune region of southern Lake Michigan circling and wheeling,\r\n     flashing alternately snow-white breasts and darker backs.\r\n     Long-range examination with binoculars showed rather prominent\r\n     whitish wing bars, but the identity of the birds was never\r\n     satisfactorily determined until the afternoon of August 28, 1921,\r\n     when the writer was camping at the mouth of the above-mentioned Bar\r\n     Creek, in Sheboygan County, Wis. About 2 o'clock in the afternoon a\r\n     light fog drifted in, and soon after large numbers of small shore\r\n     birds, similar in actions and appearance to those mentioned, were\r\n     sighted executing extraordinary maneuvers close to the surface of\r\n     the water about 500 yards out. They circled and recircled, turned\r\n     and twisted, some of the flocks finally alighting in some smooth\r\n     streaks in the water inshore of a long line of net stakes that\r\n     extended about a mile out. Fully 500 of the birds, now recognized\r\n     as phalaropes, were in sight. One specimen, a female in fall\r\n     plumage, was finally secured by tying the shotgun onto driftwood\r\n     pieces and swimming out among them. They were in no way disturbed\r\n     at my presence until a shot was fired, and I fully satisfied myself\r\n     that the bulk of the flock were of the same species as the one\r\n     secured, northern phalaropes.\r\n\r\nJ. A. Munro tells me that these birds are irregular fall migrants at\r\nOkanagan Landing, British Columbia, from July 28 to September 18. Along\r\nthe California coast the fall migration is heavy and prolonged from the\r\nlatter part of July until late October or early November, the bulk of\r\nthe flight passing during August and September. Grinnell, Bryant, and\r\nStorer (1918) say:\r\n\r\n     Heavy winds on the ocean sometimes prove disastrous to the\r\n     migrating hosts of northern phalaropes. Chapman records finding\r\n     many bodies of this species in the tide pools of the Farallon\r\n     Islands. A heavy northwest wind had been blowing along the coast\r\n     for the previous two weeks, and many of the birds had resorted to\r\n     inland pools of water. The emaciated condition of the birds at the\r\n     Farallones was probably due to their inability to procure food\r\n     while on the open ocean in migration. Forbush records numbers of\r\n     these birds as being killed on the Atlantic coast by dashing\r\n     against lighthouses at night. In the Cape Region of Lower\r\n     California, Brewster found that \"most of the birds examined had\r\n     lost one or more toes, and two or three an entire foot, and part of\r\n     the tarsus also, while others showed gaping wounds on the breast.\r\n     These mutilations were probably caused by the bites of fishes.\"\r\n     Emerson records finding several of these birds killed by flying\r\n     against the telephone wires strung across the salt ponds on the\r\n     marshes west of Hayward, and says that very many of this and other\r\n     species of birds are killed in this manner.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Practically nothing is known about the winter home of this\r\nspecies in the Western Hemisphere. It is evidently south of the borders\r\nof the United States and probably south of the Equator on the open\r\nocean. The few straggling winter records for California and South\r\nAmerica give but a scant clue to the winter resorts of the vast numbers\r\nthat pass us on migrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Distributed over both Old and New Worlds.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--Arctic regions of both hemispheres. In Europe and\r\nAsia the breeding range of the northern phalarope extends from Iceland,\r\nSpitsbergen, and Scandinavia, across northern Russia and Siberia to\r\nBering Sea. South to Sakhalin Island, southern Russia (Orenburg), and\r\nthe Outer Hebrides, Shetland, and Orkney Islands.\r\n\r\nIn North America the breeding range extends north to Alaska (Near\r\nIslands, St. Paul Island, Nelson Island, Pastolik, St. Michael, probably\r\nGolofin Bay, the Kowak Valley, Cape Blossom, Point Hope, Point Barrow,\r\nand the Gens de Large Mountains); Mackenzie (Franklin Bay); Keewatin\r\n(Cape Eskimo); probably Baffin Island (Cumberland Sound); and Greenland\r\n(North Star Bay, Upernavik and Jacob's Bight). East to Greenland (Disko\r\nIsland); Labrador (Nain and Hopedale); and western Quebec (Fort George\r\nand Rupert House). South to western Quebec (Rupert House); northern\r\nManitoba (York Factory and Fort Churchill); Mackenzie (Artillery Lake\r\nand Fort Rae); and Alaska (Nushagak and Kiska Island). West to Alaska\r\n(Kiska and Near Islands).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The winter range of the European and Asiatic birds\r\nappears to extend south to southern Japan, the north coast of New\r\nGuinea, Ceram, the coast of Beluchistan, the east coast of Arabia, and\r\nprobably points in the northern part of the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe winter range of North American breeding birds of this species is\r\nmore or less imperfectly known, and they are believed to winter largely\r\nat sea. It has been reported as wintering in southern California; it has\r\nbeen taken or observed in Costa Rica (Desamparados) and Peru (Tumbez);\r\nthere is a specimen in the museum at Buenos Aires, Argentina, that was\r\ntaken in Patagonia.\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--Early dates of arrival in North America are:\r\nFlorida, 175 miles west of Tampa, March 14; Bermuda Islands, March 18;\r\nSouth Carolina, near Chester, May 17; North Carolina, Cape Lookout,\r\nApril 3; Maryland, Cumberland, May 23; New Jersey, 80 miles off\r\nBarnegat, May 6, and Cape May County, May 22; New York, Long Cave, April\r\n2, Montauk Point, April 30, and Branchport, May 16; Connecticut,\r\nQuinnipiac Marshes, May 21; Massachusetts, near Boston, May 5, Marthas\r\nVineyard, May 6, and Provincetown, May 21; Maine, near Milo, May 3;\r\nQuebec, Godbout, May 27; Nova Scotia, Halifax, May 12; Ohio,\r\nYoungstown, May 26; Nebraska, Lincoln, May 10; Manitoba, Shoal Lake,\r\nMay 19; Saskatchewan, Indian Head, May 15, Osler, May 13, and Dinsmore,\r\nMay 30; Colorado, Loveland, May 1, Denver, May 17, and Middle Park, May\r\n26; Montana, Big Sandy, May 18, and Terry, May 21; Alberta, Beaverhill\r\nLake, May 7; California, Monterey, April 9, Santa Barbara, April 24,\r\nFresno, May 5, Los Banos, May 19, and Santa Cruz, May 22; Oregon,\r\nKlamath Falls, April 17, Malheur Lake, April 26, and Newport, April 30;\r\nWashington, Destruction Island Lighthouse, April 27, Shoalwater Bay, May\r\n9, and Olympia, May 13; British Columbia, Okanagan Landing, May 18, and\r\nMabel Lake, May 25; Yukon, Forty-mile, May 3; Alaska, Fort Kenia, May 3,\r\nBethel, May 19, Kowak River, May 22, Igushik, May 23, St. Michael, May\r\n14, Fort Yukon, June 1, and Point Barrow, June 11; and Greenland, North\r\nStar Bay, June 14.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--Late dates of departure are: Alaska, Pribilof\r\nIslands, August 31, Port Clarence, September 6, and Okutan, September\r\n17; British Columbia, Okanagan Landing, October 15; Washington, Clallam\r\nBay, October 28; Oregon, Oswego, September 25; California, Fresno,\r\nOctober 6, Watsonville, October 20, and Monterey, October 24; Montana,\r\nPriest Butte Lakes, September 4, Columbia Falls, September 13, and\r\nCorvallis, September 20; Idaho, Salmon River Mountains, September 5;\r\nWyoming, Fort Washakie, September 13, and Yellowstone Park, September\r\n18; Colorado, near Denver, October 13; Manitoba, Whitewater Lake,\r\nSeptember 9, and Shoal Lake, September 21; North Dakota, Stump Lake,\r\nSeptember 2; Nebraska, Lincoln, October 26; Minnesota, St. Vincent,\r\nAugust 31; Wisconsin, near Cedar Grove, September 23; Ontario, Ottawa,\r\nOctober 12; Ohio, Youngstown, October 9; Newfoundland, October 11;\r\nUngava, mouth of the Koksoak River, September 19; Maine, near\r\nPittsfield, September 3; New Hampshire, Lonesome Lake, September 22,\r\nLancaster, October 8, and Dublin Pond, October 13; Massachusetts,\r\nNantucket, September 20, near Springfield, September 23, Swampscott,\r\nSeptember 26, Harvard, October 5, and Ware, October 13; Connecticut,\r\nHartford, September 27; New York, Branchport, September 15, Athol\r\nSpring, September 24, Oneida Lake, September 21, Ithaca, September 27,\r\nFlushing, September 29, and Montauk Point, October 22; New Jersey, Stone\r\nHarbor, September 4, near Tuckerton, September 13, and 5-fathom Beach\r\nLight, October 12; Pennsylvania, Pittston, September 2, Beaver,\r\nSeptember 26, Carlisle, October 1, and Erie, October 10; District of\r\nColumbia, Washington, August 31; West Virginia, near Parkersburg,\r\nSeptember 26; North Carolina, Bladen County, September 23; and South\r\nCarolina, Frogmore, September 25, and Sea Islands, October 25.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--The northern phalarope is apparently less common in\r\nthe Mississippi Valley and the Southwest.

Perhaps 10 or a dozen species of ducks could be seen in the\r\nopen water, gulls and terns were drifting about overhead, grebes and\r\ncountless coots were scurrying in and out among the reeds, and noisy\r\nkilldeers added their plaintive cries to the ceaseless din from swarms\r\nof blackbirds in the marsh. In marked contrast to the clownish coots and\r\nthe noisy killdeers and blackbirds, the almost silent, gentle, dainty,\r\nlittle phalaropes stand out in memory as charming features in the\r\npicture, so characteristic of western bird life. The virgin prairies are\r\nnearly gone, but there are still left a few oases of moisture in our\r\nencroaching civilization, where these graceful birds may continue to\r\ndelight the eye with their gentle manners.\r\n\r\nUnlike the other two world-wide species, the Wilson phalarope is a\r\nstrictly American bird, making its summer home in the interior of North\r\nAmerica and wintering in southern South America. It differs from the\r\nother two also in being less pelagic and more terrestrial; it is seldom,\r\nif ever, seen on the oceans, being a bird of the inland marshes; and it\r\nprefers to spend more time walking about on land, or wading in shallow\r\nwater, than swimming on the water. Hence its bill, neck and legs are\r\nlonger, and its feet less lobed. It is a more normal shore bird.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The spring migration seems to be directly northward from the\r\nwest coasts of South America, through Central America, to the\r\nMississippi Valley on one hand and to California on the other. Although\r\nit usually arrives in Manitoba during the first week in May, sometimes\r\nas early as April 27, I have found it common in Texas as late as May 17.\r\nWilson phalarope are often associated with northern phalaropes on\r\nmigrations, sometimes in considerable flocks, frequenting the temporary\r\nponds made by heavy spring rains on the grassy meadows, rather than the\r\nlarger ponds and lakes. The first arrivals are usually females, followed\r\nlater by mixed flocks of both sexes, which soon scatter and separate\r\ninto small parties of two or three pairs.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--The pursuit courtship is thus described by Rev. P. B.\r\nPeabody (1903):\r\n\r\n     For some three weeks after their arrival, these birds gladden\r\n     landscape and water scape, in care-free abandon. They are ever on\r\n     the move, afoot or awing; and during these three weeks of\r\n     junketing, the unique courtship is carried on. There is no more\r\n     laughable sight, to one endowed with a modicum of the sense of\r\n     humor, than that of a couple, or even three, of the brightly\r\n     colored females, ardently chasing a single somber-plumaged male,\r\n     who turns and darts, here and there, in arrowy flights apparently\r\n     much bored by the whole performance. Meanwhile, the sometimes\r\n     dangling feet and the ever tremulous wings of the amorous females\r\n     bespeak an ardor that would be ridiculous, under the circumstances,\r\n     were it not so desperately in earnest.\r\n\r\nDr. E. W. Nelson (1877), on the other hand, writes:\r\n\r\n     At these times the nearest approach to pursuit is in a habit they\r\n     have of suddenly darting off for a short distance at right angles\r\n     to their general course, but this appears to be in mere sport, for\r\n     nearly the same relative positions are kept by the birds, and this\r\n     erratic course is rarely pursued beyond a few rods. In fact,\r\n     throughout the pairing season I have always found the phalaropes\r\n     very undemonstrative toward each other, the choice of mates being\r\n     conducted in a quiet, unobtrusive way, quite unlike the usual\r\n     manner among birds. The only demonstrations I have observed during\r\n     the pairing time consist of a kind of solemn bowing of the head and\r\n     body; but sometimes, with the head lowered and thrust forward, they\r\n     will run back and forth in front of the object of their regard, or\r\n     again a pair may often be seen to salute each other by alternately\r\n     bowing or lowering their heads; but their courtship is\r\n     characterized by a lack of rivalry and vehemence usually exhibited\r\n     by birds. A male is often accompanied by two females at first, but\r\n     as soon as his choice is made the rejected bird joins her fortunes\r\n     with some more impressible swain.\r\n\r\nDuring my various seasons spent on the western plains I have frequently\r\nseen these phalaropes flying about in trios, consisting of one male and\r\ntwo females, the male always in the lead, as if pursued. Females\r\napparently outnumber the males; and, as nest building and incubation are\r\nentirely performed by the male, many of the females must remain\r\nunattached and unable to breed. I have actually seen the male building\r\nthe nest and have never been able to flush a female from a set of eggs\r\nor a brood of young.\r\n\r\nW. Leon Dawson (1923) writes:\r\n\r\n     We have already acknowledged that Mrs. Wilson wears the breeches\r\n     and that she is more inclined to club life than she is to household\r\n     cares. The case is, however, much more serious than we had at first\r\n     suspected. I owe the original intimation of the true state of\r\n     affairs to Mr. A. O. Treganza, the veteran oologist of Salt Lake\r\n     City; and subsequent investigation of my own has abundantly\r\n     confirmed his claims. Mrs. Wilson is a bigamist. Not occasionally,\r\n     and of course not invariably, but very usually she maintains two\r\n     establishments. Now that attention is called to it, we see that our\r\n     notebooks are full of references to female phalaropes seen in\r\n     company with two males. The association can not be accidental, for\r\n     we are in the very midst of the breeding season. The males,\r\n     frightened by our presence in the swamp, and not daring to remain\r\n     longer upon their eggs, have sought the comforting presence of the\r\n     head of their house. The three take counsel together, and it is\r\n     only when the redoubtable lady announces that the way is clear that\r\n     the dutiful cuckolds trail off to their nests. On the 6th and 7th\r\n     of June, 1922, our M. C. O. party of three members gave close\r\n     attention to a swamp in Long Valley, southern Mono County, at an\r\n     altitude of 7,000 feet. We took 11 sets, of four eggs each, of the\r\n     Wilson phalaropes, and we noted a distinct tendency of the nests to\r\n     group themselves in pairs. In only one instance, however, were we\r\n     able to trace clearly a connection between two occupied nests.\r\n     These two, containing heavily incubated eggs, were situated only 42\r\n     feet apart, and the two males who were flushed from them by a\r\n     surprise coup of ours joined themselves immediately to the only\r\n     female who had shown any solicitude concerning this section of the\r\n     swamp.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The Wilson phalarope is regarded by some egg collectors as\r\nan exasperating bird, because they have some difficulty in finding its\r\nnest. The nest is surprisingly well concealed, often in what seems to be\r\nscanty vegetation; and the eggs are good examples of protective\r\ncoloration. I remember once crossing a moist meadow, covered with short\r\ngrass which had been mowed the previous season; a male phalarope flushed\r\nfrom almost under foot, I threw down my hat to mark the spot and started\r\nhunting for the nest. I hunted in vain, until I gave it up and picked up\r\nmy hat; there was the nest, with four eggs in it, under the hat and in\r\nplain sight.\r\n\r\nIn southwestern Saskatchewan in 1905 and 1906, we found some half dozen\r\nor more nests of this species, between June 8 and July 13. The nests\r\nwere on the wet or moist meadows about the lakes and sloughs or on\r\nmarshy islands; some of the nests were in practically plain sight in\r\nshort grass; others were more or less well concealed in longer grass,\r\nwhich was sometimes arched over them; they were always difficult to find\r\nunless the incubating male was flushed. The nests were merely hollows in\r\nthe damp ground, three or four inches in diameter, either scantily or\r\nwell lined with dry grass.\r\n\r\nDoctor Nelson (1877) gives a very good description of the behavior of\r\nthese birds on their nesting grounds, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Incubation is attended to by the male alone. The female, however,\r\n     keeps near, and is quick to give the alarm upon the approach of\r\n     danger. The females are frequently found at this time in small\r\n     parties of six or eight; and should their breeding ground be\r\n     approached, exhibit great anxiety, coming from every part of the\r\n     marsh to meet the intruder, and, hovering over his head, utter a\r\n     weak nasal note, which can be heard to only a short distance.\r\n\r\n     The movements of the birds usually render it an easy matter to\r\n     decide whether or not they have nests in the immediate vicinity.\r\n     After the first alarm, those having nests at a distance disperse,\r\n     while the others take their course in the form of an ellipse,\r\n     sometimes several hundred yards in length, with the object of their\r\n     suspicion in the center; and, with long strokes of their wings,\r\n     much like the flight of a killdeer, they move back and forth. As\r\n     their nests are approached the length of their flight is gradually\r\n     lessened, until at last they are joined by the males, when the\r\n     whole party hover low over the intruder's head, uttering their\r\n     peculiar note of alarm. At this time they have an ingenious mode of\r\n     misleading the novice, by flying off to a short distance and\r\n     hovering anxiously over a particular spot in the marsh, as though\r\n     there were concealed the objects of their solicitation. Should they\r\n     be followed, however, and a search be there made, the maneuver is\r\n     repeated in another place still farther from the real location of\r\n     the nest. But should this ruse prove unavailing, they return and\r\n     seem to become fairly desperate, flying about one's head almost\r\n     within reach, manifesting great distress.\r\n\r\nAretas A. Saunders writes to me that, in Teton County, Mont., they nest\r\nin small colonies in grassy marshes, where alkaline soil prevents the\r\ngrass, mainly species of _Carex_ and _Juncus_, from growing tall.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The Wilson phalarope almost invariably lays four eggs, rarely\r\nonly three. The shapes vary from ovate pyriform to ovate and there is a\r\nslight gloss. The ground colors vary from \"cartridge buff\" to \"cream\r\nbuff,\" rarely \"chamois.\" The ground color is generally well concealed by\r\nnumerous markings, more or less evenly distributed. Some eggs are\r\nuniformly covered with small spots and dots, but more often these are\r\nmixed with a few larger, irregular blotches. An occasional handsome set\r\nis boldly and very heavily blotched, sometimes almost concealing the\r\nground color. The markings are usually in very dark, brownish black or\r\nblackish brown. In some handsome sets these dark markings are mixed with\r\n\"bay\" and \"auburn\" markings. The measurements of 57 eggs average 33 by\r\n23.4 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =36.2= by\r\n23.7, 33 by =25.1=, =30= by 22.5 and 30.5 by =22= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation does not seem to be known. I can find\r\nno evidence that the female ever takes any part in it, but that she does\r\nnot lose interest in her family is plainly shown by her demonstrations\r\nof anxiety when the nest is approached; probably she feels responsible\r\nfor the faithful performance of his duties by her demure spouse. The\r\nmale broods over the newly hatched young, protecting them from rain, or\r\nexcessive heat or cold. But they are soon able to run about in a lively\r\nmanner and care for themselves. Doctor Nelson (1877) writes that \"the\r\nyoung have a fine, wiry peep, inaudible beyond a few feet.\" I believe\r\nthat the young remain in the grassy meadows, where they can hide in\r\nsafety, and do not take to the water until they are fully fledged.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--In its natal down the young Wilson phalarope is entirely\r\nunlike the other phalaropes and quite different from any other young\r\nwader. The slender bill and long slender legs and feet are\r\ncharacteristic. It is prettily and distinctively colored also. The\r\nprevailing color of the upper parts and of a band across the chest is\r\n\"ochraceous buff,\" deepening on the crown, wings, and mantle almost to\r\n\"ochraceous orange,\" and paling to buffy or grayish white on the belly\r\nand to pure white on the chin and throat. There is a narrow, median,\r\nblack line on the crown extending nearly or quite to the bill; this is\r\ncontinued in a broad, more or less broken, black stripe down the center\r\nof the back to a large black patch on the rump; a black spot on each\r\nside of the crown, one on the occiput and several more on wings, thighs,\r\nand sides of the back, sometimes run together to form stripes.\r\n\r\nIn fresh juvenal plumage, in July, the feathers of the crown, back,\r\nscapulars, tertials, and all wing coverts are dusky or nearly black,\r\nbroadly edged with \"light pinkish cinnamon\" or \"cinnamon buff,\" broadest\r\nand brightest on the scapulars; the under parts are white, but the\r\nthroat, sides of the breast and flanks are washed with \"pinkish buff,\"\r\nand the last two are mottled with dusky; the central tail feathers are\r\nbroadly edged with \"pinkish buff,\" bordered inwardly with a broad dusky\r\nband, surrounding a white area, with a dusky central streak invading it;\r\nthe other tail feathers are similarly marked, but less completely\r\npatterned.\r\n\r\nThis plumage is worn for only a short time, as the body plumage and tail\r\nare molted during the last half of July and in August. By September\r\nyoung birds are in first winter plumage, which is like that of the\r\nadult, except that the entire juvenal wing is retained with the buff\r\nedgings faded out to white. The sexes are alike in juvenal and all\r\nwinter plumages. A partial prenuptial molt in the spring, involving the\r\nbody plumage and most, if not all, of the wing coverts and scapulars,\r\nmakes the young bird practically adult.\r\n\r\nAdults have a partial prenuptial molt in April and May, involving the\r\ntail, the wing coverts and all the body plumage, which produces the\r\nwell-known brilliant plumage of the female and the duller plumage of the\r\nmale. The complete postnuptial molt in summer produces the gray winter\r\nplumage in both sexes, in which the crown, back, and scapulars are\r\n\"light drab\" or \"drab-gray,\" with narrow white edgings, and the upper\r\ntail coverts, as well as the under parts, are white. The sexes can be\r\nrecognized in adult winter plumage by size only.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The other two species of phalaropes feed mainly on the water,\r\nbut the Wilson phalarope is more of a shore bird and obtains most of its\r\nfood while walking about on muddy shores or wading in shallow water. It\r\ndoes, however, adopt the whirling tactics of the others occasionally,\r\nconcerning which Mr. Dawson (1923) says:\r\n\r\n     Instead of swinging from side to side with a rhythmical motion, as\r\n     do the reds and northerns, the Wilson whirls all the way around.\r\n     Moreover, he keeps on whirling, and though he pauses for the\r\n     fraction of a second to inspect his chances, he goes on and on\r\n     again like an industrious, mad clock. One bird which I had under\r\n     the binoculars turned completely around 247 times in one spot,\r\n     without stopping save for instantaneous dabs at prey. These dabs\r\n     were directed forward or backward, i. e., with or against the\r\n     direction of the body motion. A single gyration normally contains\r\n     two such minute pauses, accompanied by a hitching motion of the\r\n     head; and these are evidently the periods of maximum attention,\r\n     since they are followed by, or rather flow into, the prey stroke,\r\n     if game is sighted. \"Game\" is not always abundant nor certain, and\r\n     I have seen a bird whirl a dozen times without a single stroke.\r\n\r\nThe method of feeding on mud flats or in shallow water is well described\r\nby Roland C. Ross (1924), as follows:\r\n\r\n     When feeding along the shallows with least, western, and red-backed\r\n     sandpipers, they differed from them not only in size and color, but\r\n     in their habit of steady, energetic walking and the constant \"side\r\n     sweeping\" with the bill. Occasionally they picked objects from the\r\n     surface with their needle bills, but this was not very actively\r\n     pursued. In deeper water they fed among the northern phalaropes,\r\n     knots, and dowitchers, wading along until they swam in places.\r\n     However, they were able to wade where the northern swam. At such\r\n     depths they feed with the head clear under and the energy of the\r\n     feeding operation was indicated by the motion of the tail. They\r\n     commonly walked steadily back and forth through the deeper sections\r\n     of the ponds, and in such deep places they moved as headless\r\n     bodies, evidently feeding as usual in the surface mud. From the\r\n     vigorous side moves of the tail it would seem they were feeding in\r\n     their usual manner as well; that is, \"side sweeping.\" When the\r\n     birds were standing to feed in the deeper places the tail was again\r\n     much in evidence, and indicated the manner of feeding. This would\r\n     seem to be a probing motion performed with some rapid vibration\r\n     which was communicated to the tail as a series of quivers. It is\r\n     rather a droll sight, and arresting as well, to see a certain area\r\n     marked out by headless gray bodies buried in the water up to the\r\n     bend of the wing, the vibrating tail indicating the vigorous\r\n     operations being carried on down below. It seemed their best\r\n     feeding was in the deeper waters.\r\n\r\nThe feeding habits of this and the other phalaropes are almost wholly\r\nbeneficial. They live very largely on the larvae of mosquitoes. They\r\nalso eat crane-fly larvae, which are often very destructive in grass\r\nlands and wheat fields. Predaceous diving beetles, which are a nuisance\r\nin fish hatcheries, are eaten by them. Dr. Alexander Wetmore's (1925)\r\nanalysis of the contents of 106 stomachs showed that the food of the\r\nWilson phalarope is mainly insects, of which various flies made up 43.1\r\nper cent, aquatic bugs 24.4 per cent and beetles 20.1 per cent. The\r\nremainder of the food included brine shrimps, amphipods, eggs of water\r\nfleas, and seeds of various aquatic plants.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Much of the interesting behavior of the Wilson phalaropes\r\nhas been described under different headings above. In all its movements\r\nit is light, airy and graceful. Its flight is much like that of the\r\nlesser yellow legs, with which it is often associated; but, when\r\nsuddenly alarmed, it sometimes flies hurriedly away in a zigzag fashion.\r\nOn its breeding grounds it often hovers, almost motionless in the air,\r\nas the upland plover sometimes does. It swims lightly and buoyantly, but\r\napparently does not dive. It walks about on land actively and daintily,\r\nwhere it is said to resemble the solitary sandpiper. It mingles freely\r\non its feeding grounds with various other species of shore birds. Toward\r\nthe close of the nesting season the females become very gregarious; as\r\nearly as June 18, in southern Alberta, we saw them in large flocks,\r\nmixed with lesser yellow legs, flying about the marshy lakes.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The only note I have recorded is a soft, nasal grunt or\r\nsubdued quack. Dr. Walter P. Taylor (1912) describes a peculiar nuptial\r\n(?) call note \"as _oit_, _oit_, _oit_, somewhat resembling the croak of\r\na toad during the breeding season. At the instant of utterance of the\r\nnote the bird which is calling raises its head somewhat, pauses\r\nmomentarily in its flight, and its throat bulges slightly.\" Mr. Saunders\r\ncalls it a low note sounding like _croo_, _croo_, _croo_.\r\n\r\nE. S. Cameron (1907) writes:\r\n\r\n     The Wilson's phalaropes, both when feeding and when disturbed and\r\n     circling on the wing, constantly uttered a low croaking, which at\r\n     close quarters might be compared to the much louder note of the\r\n     sandhill cranes, or, at a distance, to the faintly heard barking of\r\n     a dog. On the other hand, I have heard them give a shrill and\r\n     totally different call of indecision or satisfaction on their first\r\n     arrival when hovering over a pool.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The Wilson is larger than the other phalaropes and has a\r\nlonger bill, neck, and legs. It can be distinguished from other shore\r\nbirds by its needlelike bill and small head and by the absence of white\r\nin its wings. Its spring plumage is, of course, well marked and very\r\nbeautiful. John T. Nichols gives me the following field characters:\r\n\r\n     Very rare, but apparently regular on the south shore of Long Island\r\n     in southward migration; those that I have known of have all been in\r\n     pale gray and white plumage occurring singly about the marshes in\r\n     flocks of the lesser yellow legs. Little smaller than that species,\r\n     they are to be picked out in a flock of same at once by their much\r\n     paler color. In alighting such a bird may swim on puddles of water\r\n     between the stubble where the others are wading. At short range the\r\n     long, straight, very slender bill and indications of a curved\r\n     \"phalarope\" mark on the neck, backward and downward from the eye,\r\n     are to be looked for. Large size and long, very slender bill should\r\n     prevent confusion of this with other phalaropes in the field in any\r\n     plumage.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--As soon as the young are able to care for themselves the males\r\njoin the flocks of females and they all depart on their fall migration\r\nin August. Some individuals wander eastward to the Atlantic coast, but\r\nthe main flight is southward along both coasts of Mexico to their winter\r\nhome in Argentina, Chile, and Patagonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North and South America.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The breeding range of Wilson's phalarope extends\r\nnorth to Washington (Bumping Lake); Alberta (Alix, Buffalo Lake, and\r\nEdmonton); Saskatchewan (Osler, Quill Lake, and Indian Head); Manitoba\r\n(Moose Mountain, Brandon, and Shoal Lake); North Dakota (Pembina);\r\nMinnesota (probably Leech Lake); Michigan (St. Clair Flats); and\r\nsouthern Ontario (Dunnville). East to southern Ontario (Dunnville);\r\nnorthern Indiana (Lake County); northern Illinois (West Northfield, Fox\r\nRiver, and Calumet Marshes); and formerly Missouri (Pierce). South to\r\nIndiana (Whiting); Missouri (formerly Pierce); rarely southern Kansas\r\n(Meade County); Colorado (Sterling, Barr, and San Luis Valley);\r\nsouthwestern Wyoming (Fort Bridger); northern Utah (Salt Lake City);\r\nNevada (Washoe Lake); and California (Tahoe Lake and Los Banos). West to\r\nCalifornia (Los Banos, Lassen County, and Tule Lake); Oregon (Klamath\r\nLake); and Washington (Conconully and Bumping Lake). It also has been\r\nreported in summer from southern California (Furnace Creek and Tulare\r\nLake) and from central Mexico (Lerma).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The winter range of the Wilson phalarope is very\r\nimperfectly known. The few records available come chiefly from South\r\nAmerica, but it also has been reported as wintering in Mexico\r\n(Mayorazgo, Ixtapalapa, and the City of Mexico); rarely southern Texas\r\n(Corpus Christi); and in southern California (Riverside).

Localities and\r\nconditions best suited to its needs are still to be found in many places\r\non the great plains and in the interior valleys of the far west. Its\r\nfavorite resorts seem to be the shallow, muddy borders of alkaline\r\nlakes, wide open spaces of extensive marshes, where scanty vegetation\r\ngives but little concealment, or broad wet meadows splashed with shallow\r\npools. If the muddy pools are covered with reeking scum, attracting\r\nmyriads of flies, so much the better for feeding purposes. Dry,\r\nsun-baked mud flats or low, gravelly or sandy islands, with scanty\r\nvegetation, furnish the desired nesting conditions. In such open spaces\r\nthey can be seen from afar and, long before we reach their haunts, the\r\navocets are flying out to meet us, advertising the fact that we are\r\napproaching their home, making the air ring with their loud yelping\r\nnotes of protest, circling about us and darting down at us in\r\nthreatening plunges.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Prof. Julian S. Huxley (1925), who has made a study of the\r\nEuropean species, says:\r\n\r\n     The avocet has no courtship. There are no songs or aerial displays;\r\n     no posturing by the male; no mutual ceremonies; no special\r\n     courtship notes. There is some hostility and fighting; a peculiar\r\n     action by the female which is a symbol of readiness to pair,\r\n     followed by an excited action on the part of the male; and a\r\n     special post-paring action by both birds; but of courtship in any\r\n     accepted sense none whatever.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, our bird does indulge in actions and posturings\r\nwhich look very much like courtship. On May 29, 1905, we spent some time\r\nin watching the avocets in a colony on an alkali flat covered with a\r\nsparse growth of short, curly grass, near Hay Lake in southwestern\r\nSaskatchewan. We could not find any nests there at that time and\r\nconcluded that the birds had not laid. They were apparently still\r\nconducting their courtships, wading about gracefully in the shallow\r\nwater, frequently bowing or crouching down close to the water; sometimes\r\nthey danced about with wings widespread, tipping from side to side like\r\na balancing tight-rope walker; occasionally one, perhaps a female in an\r\nattitude of invitation, would lie prostrate on the ground or water for a\r\nminute or more, with the head and neck extended and wings outstretched.\r\nFrequently they fooled us by squatting down on the ground, as if sitting\r\non a nest; if we went to investigate, they would run away and repeat the\r\nact elsewhere; perhaps this act carried the suggestion of mating as a\r\npart of the courtship ceremony.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--We found no large breeding colonies in Saskatchewan but\r\nseveral small ones. The Hay Lake colony referred to above was perhaps\r\nthe largest, containing 15 or 20 pairs. The nests, found here on June\r\n15, were merely slight hollows in the sun-baked mud on the broad alkali\r\nflats bordering the shallow lake; they were scattered widely among the\r\nlittle tufts of short grass which scantily covered the flat; the hollows\r\nmeasured from 3 to 4 inches in diameter and were lined with a few dry\r\ngrasses. Some of the nests were well formed and somewhat elevated.\r\nAlthough in plain sight, the eggs were not easy to find, as they matched\r\ntheir surroundings perfectly.\r\n\r\nOn June 14, 1906, we found an interesting little colony of avocets on an\r\nisland in Big Stick Lake, Saskatchewan, which was also occupied by big\r\ncolonies of California and ring-billed gulls, common terns, a few\r\nspotted sandpipers, and a few pairs of ducks. The avocets, terns, and\r\nsandpipers were all at one end of the island, a low grassy point; the\r\nring-billed gulls and ducks were in the central, highest part; and the\r\nCalifornia gull colony was at the other end. The avocets' nests, ten or\r\na dozen of them, were placed in the short grass near the edge of the\r\nbeach or on the drift weed lying in windrows on the beach; one nest was\r\npartially under a fallen shrub or bushy weed. The nests were made of\r\ngrasses, weed stems, straws and small sticks, with sometimes a few\r\nfeathers, loosely arranged around small hollows, from 5 to 7 inches in\r\ndiameter. Two of the nests held five eggs, the others three or four.\r\n\r\nRobert B. Rockwell (1912) found an interesting colony of avocets on an\r\nisland in Barr Lake, Colo., of which he says:\r\n\r\n     The nests were all located in very similar locations, among a young\r\n     growth of cockle burrs not over six inches in height and which had\r\n     probably grown at least half of that since the eggs were laid. The\r\n     cockle burrs formed a belt about 10 yards wide clear around the\r\n     island just below the dense blue-stem and other rank grass with\r\n     which the Island was covered and on ground that was under water\r\n     during the high water of the spring although inundated for a short\r\n     time only. Two of the nests were very crude affairs, being a mere\r\n     shallow hollow in the sand with a very few dead weed stalks of\r\n     short lengths arranged around the eggs. The other was constructed\r\n     in the same manner, but was quite well lined with weed stems, so\r\n     that the eggs did not touch the ground. There was no evident\r\n     attempt at concealment, the nests all being placed in small open\r\n     spaces from six inches to a foot in diameter, and with nothing to\r\n     protect them; but the color of the eggs was sufficient protection\r\n     to make them quite inconspicuous.\r\n\r\nDr. Alexander Wetmore (1925) writes:\r\n\r\n     The sites chosen often are subject to inundation by sudden floods,\r\n     when the birds scurry about, seemingly in confusion, but in reality\r\n     working actively to build up the nest in order to support the eggs\r\n     above the level of the encroaching water. In some cases it may be\r\n     necessary to erect a structure 12 or 15 inches in height. Weeds,\r\n     small sticks, bones, or dried bodies of ducks or other birds,\r\n     feathers, or any other materials available are utilized as building\r\n     materials.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The American avocet lays three or four eggs, usually four and\r\noccasionally five. Numerous nests have been found containing seven or\r\neight eggs, but these are probably products of two females. Edwin\r\nBeaupré writes to me that, in a colony of five pairs found by him on an\r\nisland in a small lake in southern Alberta, the five pairs were\r\noccupying three nests; one contained eight eggs, another seven and the\r\nthird four. The eggs vary in shape from ovate (rarely) to ovate pyriform\r\nand they are usually much elongated. The shell is smooth, but not\r\nglossy. The ground color varies from \"Isabella color\" to \"deep olive\r\nbuff.\" This is more or less evenly covered with irregular spots and\r\nblotches, in various sizes, of brownish black, blackish brown, or black,\r\nrarely \"warm sepia\" or \"bister\"; there are occasionally a few blackish\r\nscrawls, and numerous underlying spots of various shades of drab. The\r\nmeasurements of 55 eggs average 49.8 by 34 millimeters; the eggs showing\r\nthe four extremes measure =56.3= by 34.6, 51.5 by =36.6=, =43.2= by 33.4\r\nand 47 by =31= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation of the American bird has apparently\r\nnot been determined, but that of the European bird is said to be 28\r\ndays. I have no data as to how the sexes incubate. Young avocets are\r\nvery precocial and leave the nest soon after hatching. They are expert\r\nat hiding, even on the open flats and beaches; and they take to the\r\nwater at an early age, where they can swim and dive like young ducks. I\r\nhave seen a brood of four young, that could not have been hatched more\r\nthan a few hours, swimming out in a lake, as if very much at ease. They\r\nsoon learn to tip up in shallow water and probe on the bottom, like\r\ntheir parents, for their insect food.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy young avocet is well colored for concealment on\r\nan open beach or alkaline flat. The colors of the upper parts are\r\n\"cinnamon buff,\" \"cream buff,\" and buffy grays, lightest on the crown\r\nand darkest on the rump; there is a distinct but narrow loral stripe of\r\nblack; the crown is indistinctly spotted with dusky. Two parallel\r\nstripes of brownish black distinctly mark the scapulars and two more the\r\nsides of the rump; the wings, back, rump, and thighs are less distinctly\r\nspotted or peppered with gray and dusky. The under parts are buffy\r\nwhite, nearly pure white on the throat and belly.\r\n\r\nIn fresh juvenal plumage the crown is \"light drab\" with \"pinkish buff\"\r\ntips; the sides and back of the neck are deep, rich \"cinnamon,\" deeper\r\nand richer than in the adult, shading off, on the upper back, throat,\r\nand upper breast, to a suffusion of \"pinkish buff\"; the chin and belly\r\nare white; the color pattern of the upper parts is similar to that of\r\nthe adult, except that the dark feathers of the back, scapulars, and\r\ntertials are tipped with \"pinkish buff\"; and the greater and median wing\r\ncoverts are narrowly so tipped.\r\n\r\nThis plumage is worn through the summer and fall without much change\r\nexcept by extensive fading and some wear. The cinnamon has nearly\r\ndisappeared in September birds and all the buff edgings have faded or\r\nworn away. A body molt takes place in late winter or early spring which\r\nproduces a first nuptial plumage much like the adult. Young birds can,\r\nhowever, be recognized by the worn primaries and by some of the juvenal\r\nscapulars and wing coverts. The first postnuptial molt, the following\r\nsummer, is complete and produces the adult winter plumage.\r\n\r\nAdults have a complete postnuptial molt, beginning in August, and a\r\npartial prenuptial molt, beginning in January, which involves the body\r\nplumage and some of the scapulars and wing coverts. The \"cinnamon\"\r\ncolors of the head and neck are characteristic of the nuptial plumage\r\nand are replaced by pale gray in winter adults.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The feeding habits of the avocet are rather peculiar, as might\r\nbe expected of a bird with such a peculiar bill. The bill is not so\r\nsharply upturned in life, as it is in some stuffed specimens and in some\r\ndrawings. Dr. Frank M. Chapman (1891) has explained it very well, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     The use of the avocet's recurved bill is clearly explained by the\r\n     manner in which the bird procures its food. In feeding they wade\r\n     into the water and drop the bill below the surface until the\r\n     convexity of the maxilla probably touches the bottom. In this\r\n     position they move forward at a half run and with every step the\r\n     bill is swung from side to side sweeping through an arc of about\r\n     50° in search of shells and other small aquatic animals. The\r\n     mandibles are slightly opened, and at times the birds pause to\r\n     swallow their prey. It is evident that birds with a straight or a\r\n     downward curved bill could not adopt this method of feeding.\r\n\r\nAudubon (1840) describes it, as follows:\r\n\r\n     They search for food precisely in the manner of the roseate\r\n     spoonbill, moving their heads to and fro sideways, while their bill\r\n     is passing through the soft mud; and in many instances, when the\r\n     water was deeper, they would immerse their whole head and a portion\r\n     of the neck, as the spoonbill and red-breasted snipe are wont to\r\n     do. When, on the contrary, they pursued aquatic insects, such as\r\n     swim on the surface, they ran after them, and on getting up to\r\n     them, suddenly seized them by thrusting the lower mandible beneath\r\n     them, while the other was raised a good way above the surface, much\r\n     in the manner of the black shear water, which, however, performs\r\n     this act on wing. They were also expert at catching flying insects,\r\n     after which they ran with partially expanded wings.\r\n\r\nDoctor Wetmore (1925) found that, in 67 stomachs examined, animal food\r\namounted to 65.1 per cent and vegetable food 34.9 per cent. Among the\r\nanimal food were found phyllopods, dragonfly nymphs, back swimmers,\r\nwater boatmen, various beetles and flies and their larvae. The vegetable\r\nmatter consisted largely of seeds of marsh or aquatic plants. He says\r\nfurther:\r\n\r\n     Flocks of the birds search for food scattered about in shallow\r\n     water, and do not hesitate to swim when necessary in crossing the\r\n     deeper channels. Frequently a dozen or more feed in company,\r\n     walking slowly along, shoulder to shoulder, as though in drill\r\n     formation, at each forward step thrusting the head under water and\r\n     sweeping the recurved bill along the bottom with a scythelike swing\r\n     that must arouse consternation among water boatmen and other\r\n     aquatic denizens of the bays and ponds. At times the writer has\r\n     observed as many as 300 of these handsome birds feeding thus in a\r\n     single company, a scene at once spirited and striking. As the birds\r\n     feed much of the time by immersing the head, anything that may\r\n     touch the bill is gathered indiscriminately, as in feeding they\r\n     depend upon the sense of touch. From their manner of feeding,\r\n     avocets are often scavengers, taking living or recently dead prey\r\n     without much choice. The large tapeworms found almost without fail\r\n     in the duodenum of the avocet are transmitted from one bird to\r\n     another in this manner. The cast-off terminal segments of the worms\r\n     (bearing the eggs) are picked up and swallowed by other avocets, a\r\n     proceeding which the writer has personally observed. Avocets also\r\n     pick up matter floating in the water, on or near the surface, or\r\n     take insects and seeds from mud bars. The insects may be those\r\n     living in such localities or may be individuals that have been\r\n     washed up in drift.\r\n\r\nOther observers have reported avocets as feeding on grasshoppers,\r\npredaceous diving beetles, crickets, centipedes, weevils, small snails,\r\nsea slugs, small crustaceans, and even small fishes.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Avocets are at all times tame and unsuspicious, very\r\nsolicitous and aggressive on their breeding grounds, quiet and\r\nindifferent at other times, showing only mild curiosity. Their\r\ndemonstrations of anxiety on their nesting grounds, particularly if they\r\nhave young, are amusing and ludicrous. Utterly regardless of their own\r\nsafety, they meet the intruder more than half way and stay with him till\r\nhe leaves. W. Leon Dawson (1909) has described it very graphically, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     The mother bird had flushed at a hundred yards, but seeing our\r\n     position she flew toward us and dropped into the water some 50 feet\r\n     away. Here she lifted a black wing in simulation of maimed\r\n     stiffness, and flopped and floundered away with the aid of the\r\n     other one. Seeing that the ruse failed, she ventured nearer and\r\n     repeated the experiment, lifting now one wing and now both in token\r\n     of utter helplessness. After a while the male joined her, and we\r\n     had the painful spectacle of a crippled family, whose members were\r\n     uttering most doleful cries of distress, necessitated apparently by\r\n     their numerous aches and breaks. Once, for experiment's sake, we\r\n     followed, and the waders flopped along in manifest delight coaxing\r\n     us up on shore and making off through the sagebrush with broken\r\n     legs and useless wings. But we came back, finding it better to let\r\n     the birds make the advances. The birds were driven to the very\r\n     limit of frenzy, dancing, wing trailing, swaying, going through\r\n     last convulsions and beginning over again without regard to logical\r\n     sequence, all in an agony of effort to divert attention from those\r\n     precious eggs. As time elapsed, however, the color of the play\r\n     changed. Finding that the appeal of cupidity was of no avail, the\r\n     birds appeared to fall back upon the appeal to pity. Decoying was\r\n     useless, that was plain; so they stood with upraised wings,\r\n     quivering and moaning, in tenderest supplication. It was too much\r\n     even for conscious rectitude and we withdrew abashed.\r\n\r\nThe flight of the avocet is strong, direct and rather swift, much like\r\nthat of the greater yellow legs, with neck and legs fully extended, fore\r\nand aft. It can alight on or rise from the surface of the water with\r\nease. On alighting its long, black and white wings are raised above its\r\nback, and slowly folded, as it settles itself with a nodding motion of\r\nthe head, stands still and looks about it for a moment or two. No bird\r\nis better equipped for the amphibious existence that it leads; its long\r\nlegs and webbed feet enable it to wade through soft muddy shallows of\r\nvarying depths; and if it suddenly steps beyond its depth it swims as\r\nnaturally as a duck until it strikes bottom again; the thick plumage of\r\nits under parts protects it and marks it as an habitual swimmer. It\r\noften feeds while swimming by tipping up like a surface-feeding duck and\r\nreaching down into the water with its long neck and bill. It can even\r\ndive when necessary.\r\n\r\nDr. Walter P. Taylor (1912) says that avocets \"share with most other\r\nbirds a dislike of owls. Three were seen pursuing a _Speotyto_ over a\r\nwild hay meadow.\"\r\n\r\nDr. T. Gilbert Pearson (1916) noted an interesting flight maneuver:\r\n\r\n     Only a few weeks ago I was impressed anew with the beauty of these\r\n     birds. While passing down the valley of Crane Creek, in\r\n     southeastern Oregon, a flock of about 50 avocets arose and indulged\r\n     in a series of evolutions which even the most casual observer would\r\n     have paused to watch. In a fairly compact company they flew away\r\n     for a short distance, then turned, and, after coming back almost to\r\n     the starting point, dived toward the earth, arose again perhaps 50\r\n     yards in the air, then swung around and came back. These maneuvers\r\n     were repeated at least three times. Their white and black plumage,\r\n     flashing against the gray sagebrush of the desert mountain side,\r\n     and sharply relieved as they skimmed over the alkaline creek, made\r\n     a picture long to be remembered.\r\n\r\nCharles E. H. Aiken (1914)\r\n\r\n     witnessed a curious performance of avocets in Utah. In September,\r\n     1893, he visited the mouth of Bear River where hundreds of acres of\r\n     mud flats and shallow water offer an attractive resort for various\r\n     water fowl. In a submerged grove where patches of mud appeared\r\n     above the water hundreds of avocets were congregated. One little\r\n     mud island that differed from others in that it was quite round\r\n     seemed to have a fascination for the birds, and they were packed\r\n     together upon it in a mass which covered the island to the water's\r\n     edge. As the island was about 12 feet in circumference the number\r\n     of birds probably approximated 150. This mass of birds continued to\r\n     revolve about from left to right, and being so crowded the movement\r\n     was rather slow and their steps short and measured, so that the\r\n     impression was that they were all marking time in the marching.\r\n     Birds on the rim of the circle avoided walking off in the water and\r\n     crowded inward against the mass. Every moment or two birds would\r\n     leave the milling body and fly to a neighboring mud island, and as\r\n     many from near-by would fly to take their places and join the\r\n     dance. Aiken advanced quietly to within 20 yards and viewed them\r\n     for half an hour, but they continued undisturbed by his presence\r\n     and he left them so. It appeared to be a diversion of the birds.\r\n\r\nJohn G. Tyler contributes the following:\r\n\r\n     The avocet is evidently possessed of a very keen sense of hearing.\r\n     On May 21, 1921, I discovered three or four pairs in an overflowed\r\n     pasture not far from Fresno. Driving my car up to within about 100\r\n     feet of them I allowed my engine to die and sat perfectly\r\n     motionless. In about 15 minutes the birds had become thoroughly\r\n     accustomed to my presence and one bird finally took up a position\r\n     on a small levee, tucked its bill under the feathers of its back,\r\n     closed its eyes, and after raising the right leg and drawing it up\r\n     close to the body, stood absolutely motionless and apparently\r\n     asleep for several minutes. It was very much awake, however, for\r\n     when I whistled softly through my teeth, making a rather squeaking\r\n     noise, it immediately straightened up, opened its eyes, and gazed\r\n     about in apparent astonishment. As I remained motionless the bird\r\n     soon settled down and in the course of the next few moments I\r\n     repeated the same experiment always with the same results. So long\r\n     as one remains seated in the automobile and makes no noticeable\r\n     movement it is possible to make close observation of these and\r\n     several other species of shore birds, but the slightest movement or\r\n     an attempt to get out of the car sends them away in the wildest\r\n     confusion.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The avocet's vocabulary is not so elaborate as it is\r\nimpressive. The commonest note, heard on the breeding grounds as a note\r\nof alarm or protest, is a loud, shrill whistle or yelping scream, which\r\nI have recorded in my notes as _wheat, wheat, wheat_. Others have\r\nrecorded it as _plee-eek, plee-eek_, or _click, click, click_. It is\r\nalways sharp and vehement, implying anger. I have also heard a softer\r\nnote, uttered in a conversational tone, like _whick, whick, whick_, or\r\n_whuck, whuck, whuck_.\r\n\r\nAretas A. Saunders contributes the following notes:\r\n\r\n     About the nest colony the adults flew closely about my head,\r\n     calling a short staccato call that sounded like _pink, pink, pink_.\r\n     One bird pretended wounded in a different manner from what I have\r\n     seen it done by other species. The bird sat on the water, dropped\r\n     its head and neck down to the surface, half spread its wings, also\r\n     dropping them on the water, and, lying almost still, called _oo-oo,\r\n     oo-oo, oo-oo_, over and over, as though suffering great pain. The\r\n     voice was low and not very loud, and not at all like the _pink,\r\n     pink_ of the other birds.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The avocet, in its striking color pattern of black and\r\nwhite, could not be mistaken for anything else. A white tail, a black V\r\non a white back, black wings with white secondaries and blue legs are\r\nall distinctive marks; the buff head and neck are nuptial adornments; in\r\nfall and winter these parts are grayish white. From the stilt it can be\r\ndistinguished by its much stockier build, the absence of black on head\r\nand neck and by blue instead of pink legs.\r\n\r\n_Game._--Although it is a large, plump bird and would help to fill a\r\ngame bag, there is no excuse for treating it as a game bird. It is so\r\ntame and so foolishly inquisitive that it would offer poor sport and\r\nwould soon be exterminated. Furthermore its flesh is said to be\r\nworthless for the table. But above all, it is such a showy, handsome and\r\ninteresting bird, that it ought to be preserved for future generations\r\nto enjoy. The destruction of its breeding grounds will exterminate it\r\nsoon enough, as it has already been extirpated from its former range in\r\nthe Eastern States.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North America to northern Central America.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The breeding range of the avocet extends north to\r\nWashington (Moses Lake and probably Walla Walla); northern Idaho (Pend\r\nOreille); Alberta (Red Deer, Buffalo Lake, and Flagstaff); Saskatchewan\r\n(Osler, Quill Lake, and Touchwood Hills); North Dakota (Kenmare and\r\nCando); Minnesota (Brown's Valley, Traverse County); and Wisconsin\r\n(Green Bay).

It was a\r\npleasant change from the cool, damp air of the coast region to the\r\nclear, dry warmth of this highly cultivated valley. The naturally arid\r\nplains between the distant mountain ranges had been transformed by\r\nirrigation into fertile fields of alfalfa and wheat, vast areas had been\r\nflooded with water from the melting snows of the Sierras, forming\r\ngrazing lands for herds of cattle and endless marshes, wet meadows,\r\nponds and creeks, for various species of water birds. As W. Leon Dawson\r\n(1923) puts it:\r\n\r\n     The magic touch of water following its expected channels quickens\r\n     an otherwise barren plain into a paradise of avian activities.\r\n     Ducks of six or seven species frequent the deeper channels; coots\r\n     and gallinules and pied-billed grebes crowd the sedgy margins of\r\n     the ponds; herons, bitterns, ibises, and egrets, seven species of\r\n     _Herodiones_, all told, occupy the reedy depths of the larger ponds\r\n     or deploy over the grassy levels. Rails creak and titter, red wings\r\n     clink, yellow-headed blackbirds gurgle, wrangle, and screech; while\r\n     the marsh wrens, familiar spirits of the maze, sputter and chuckle\r\n     over their quaint basketry. The tricolored blackbirds, also in\r\n     great silent companies recruited from a hundred acres, charge into\r\n     their nesting covert with a din of uncanny preoccupation. Over the\r\n     open ponds black terns hover, and Forster terns flit with languid\r\n     ease. The killdeer is not forgotten, nor the burrowing owl, whose\r\n     home is in the higher knolls; but over all and above all and\r\n     through all comes the clamor of the black-necked stilt and the\r\n     American avocet.\r\n\r\nOf all these birds, the stilts were the most conspicuous in the wet\r\nmeadows about Los Banos, where they were always noisy and aggressive. I\r\nhave never seen them so abundant elsewhere, though I have seen them in\r\nsimilar situations in Florida and Texas, on extensive wet meadows where\r\nshallow water fills the hollows between myriads of little muddy islets\r\nand tufts of grass. Here they can wade about and feed in the water or\r\nbuild their nests on the hummocks above high-water mark, and here their\r\nyoung can hide successfully among the grassy tufts.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--My first glimpse of a black-necked stilt was a complete\r\nsurprise, and my first nest was in an unexpected situation. On May 8,\r\n1903, we landed on Lake Key, in the Florida Keys, a low flat, open\r\nisland with sandy shores and a lake in the middle of it. We walked\r\nacross the beach, through a narrow strip of low red mangrove bushes and\r\ncame to a little muddy pond, very shallow and dotted with little\r\nmangrove seedlings. Here we were delighted to see about half a dozen\r\nblack-necked stilts, long slender birds, very striking in appearance and\r\nactions, the jet black wings contrasting finely with the pure white\r\nunder parts and the long pink legs trailing behind. They seemed so much\r\nconcerned, so unwilling to leave, and kept up such an incessant racket,\r\nthat we felt sure that they were nesting there. A short search soon\r\nrevealed two of their nests, both very conspicuously placed. The first\r\nnest, containing four quite heavily incubated eggs, was very prettily\r\nlocated under a little red mangrove root, just as it entered the ground;\r\na hollow had been scraped in the sand and profusely lined with small\r\nbits of shell and pieces of dry sticks. The second nest was in plain\r\nsight on the open beach of finely broken shell in a small colony of\r\nleast terns' nests, the three dark-colored eggs showing up very\r\nconspicuously on the white sand. The nest cavity measured six inches\r\noutside and four inches inside and was lined with pieces of shell,\r\nsticks, and fish bones, an odd and uncomfortable bed for the young.\r\nBesides the least terns, Wilson plovers were nesting close by, rather an\r\nunusual association for the marsh-loving stilts.\r\n\r\nGilbert R. Rossignol writes to me of a colony of some 23 nests that he\r\nfound in a somewhat similar location on an island in Lake Kissimmee,\r\nFlorida, on April 14, 1908. \"The nests were all built high upon the\r\ngravelly beach and were lined with bits of fresh-water snails.\" This\r\ncolony was wiped out later by a rise of water in the lake.\r\n\r\nHerbert W. Brandt has sent me some notes on this species as he found it\r\nbreeding in Kleberg County, Texas, on May 28, 1919. He found seven nests\r\nin a colony of about ten pairs on \"a watery, marshy meadow covering\r\nabout a square mile, the water being 6 to 12 inches deep.\" He describes\r\none of the nests as \"composed of sticks made up into a floating\r\nplatform, about four inches high and well made. The lining was small\r\nsticks and the top basin shallow and nicely made. The water, exceedingly\r\nhigh from recent rains, was up to the eggs, so that the nest was wet.\" I\r\nsaw a similar colony near Brownsville, Tex.\r\n\r\nNear Los Banos, California, stilts were nesting all over the flooded\r\nmeadows, on little hummocks, on the muddy islands, and along the margins\r\nof ponds. On the drier shores and banks the nests were very simple\r\nstructures, hollows in the ground, lined with small twigs, weed stems,\r\nand grasses; but in the wet places, where they were liable to be\r\nflooded, they were quite elaborately elevated to considerable heights.\r\nMr. Dawson (1923) writes:\r\n\r\n     It is when the water rises that the birds rise to the occasion, and\r\n     get busy with nest building. Sedges, sticks, water plants with\r\n     clinging soil, anything movable, is seized and forced under the\r\n     threatened eggs. Indeed, so apprehensive is the bird of the growing\r\n     necessity, that as often as she leaves the nest she will seize\r\n     loose material and fling it over her shoulder for future use. The\r\n     eggs themselves, protectively colored in bister and black, are\r\n     mauled about and soiled in the mud; but the day is saved. I have\r\n     seen a stilt, painfully conscious no doubt, squatted on a truncated\r\n     cone of vegetation 8 inches in height and as broad across the top,\r\n     a veritable Noah's ark of safety.\r\n\r\nJohn G. Tyler (1913) says:\r\n\r\n     Nesting colonies of these waders in the Fresno district are never\r\n     very large, consisting of from 6 to 20 pairs, as a rule, the most\r\n     extensive one of which I have any knowledge containing an average\r\n     of about 30 pairs each season. Possibly the numerous small ponds\r\n     will not support a great many birds, and as suitable pastures\r\n     abound in certain sections it is not a difficult matter for all the\r\n     birds to be accommodated without any crowding. As these nesting\r\n     colonies of stilts are invariably in pastures with cattle tramping\r\n     everywhere over the fields, it seems almost a miracle that any of\r\n     the eggs escape being destroyed; and yet I have not one iota of\r\n     positive proof of such a disaster ever overtaking a stilt's nest,\r\n     while in many instances I have known the eggs to hatch safely\r\n     almost under the feet of stock. It is known that few animals will\r\n     purposely step on any living object of a size large enough to be\r\n     noticed, and the writer is convinced that a stilt simply remains on\r\n     her nest and by her vociferousness and possibly even with a few\r\n     vigorous thrusts of her long bill causes a grazing cow to direct\r\n     her course away from the nest. A lack of judgment causes many nests\r\n     to be abandoned each year, and a colony of stilts that are not able\r\n     to distinguish between a permanent pond and one that has been\r\n     caused by irrigation is liable to find that by the time sets of\r\n     eggs are complete the water has disappeared and a new nesting site\r\n     must be chosen. Fortunately the larger colonies always seem to be\r\n     located near the permanent ponds, but there are numerous scattering\r\n     pairs that are deceived each summer.\r\n\r\n     I have often been surprised at the great diversity of nesting\r\n     sites, even in the same colony, it being not an unusual occurrence\r\n     to find nests entirely surrounded by water--little islands of mud\r\n     and sticks often built up out of water several inches deep. Not\r\n     less common are the platforms of dried grass placed just at the\r\n     water's edge, or the slight excavations that, killdeerlike, are\r\n     placed on the bare ground a hundred yards or more from the nearest\r\n     water. In one colony the majority of the nests were built on a\r\n     levee that extended through the pond and were so near the waters\r\n     edge that, although most of the nests were quite elaborate\r\n     platforms of dry grass and twigs, the lower parts of the eggs were\r\n     wet. Undoubtedly a high wind would have caused the wavelets to\r\n     break over the levee. At this same place there were several nests\r\n     far out on the open dry ground without even a spear of grass for\r\n     concealment or protection, and with hardly a vestige of nesting\r\n     material under the eggs. At one pond where two pairs had taken up\r\n     summer quarters there was one nest on the bare black ground where\r\n     the white breast of the sitting female was the most conspicuous\r\n     object imaginable and could be seen at a glance from a distance of\r\n     three or four hundred feet. In direct contrast was the other nest;\r\n     for it was artfully hidden among rather rank salt grass some\r\n     distance from the pond, and when the sitting bird flattened\r\n     herself upon it, as is the custom of this species when endeavoring\r\n     to escape observation, she might have readily been overlooked from\r\n     any near-by point.\r\n\r\n     The actions of different pairs of stilts when their nesting\r\n     colonies are invaded are also variable. Sometimes a flock of noisy\r\n     screeching birds will press close about the intruder, some hanging\r\n     in the air on rapidly beating wings, others bouncing along the\r\n     ground by leaps and bounds, raising and lowering their wings\r\n     continually; while others go through every conceivable motion both\r\n     on the ground and in the air. It seems that the larger the colony\r\n     the more demonstrative the birds are; for in several instances\r\n     where only one or two pairs were breeding the female would sneak\r\n     from the nest in a guilty manner and quietly join her mate on the\r\n     opposite side of the pond, where they would remain almost\r\n     motionless or feed nervously along the margin of the pond.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Four eggs are usually laid by the black-necked stilt, sometimes\r\nfive, rarely seven, and occasionally only three. The shape is ovate,\r\noften somewhat pointed, and there is little, if any, gloss. The ground\r\ncolor is dull \"honey yellow,\" with an olivaceous tinge, or \"cream buff.\"\r\nThe eggs are irregularly spotted or covered with small blotches of\r\nbrownish black or black. Sometimes there are a few blackish scrawls and\r\nusually a few underlying small spots of drab. They are often stained\r\nwith mud. The measurements of 75 eggs, in the United States National\r\nMuseum, average 44 by 30.5 millimeters; the eggs showing the four\r\nextremes measure =48= by 30, 47 by =32=, =40.5= by 30, and 46 by =28=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Incubation is shared by both sexes, but we have no accurate\r\ninformation as to its duration. Mr. Dawson (1923) says:\r\n\r\n     The infant can make shift to shuffle away from the nest and into\r\n     cover within the hour, if need be, but he can not negotiate his\r\n     stilts until several hours have elapsed after hatching; and he\r\n     feels decidedly pale and tottery, like a young colt, until the day\r\n     after.\r\n\r\nDr. Frank M. Chapman (1908) writes:\r\n\r\n     On May 23, their eggs were hatching, and in June the snipelike\r\n     young were widely distributed over the marsh. They invariably\r\n     attempted to escape observation by squatting with neck\r\n     outstretched, but the parents, whether one approached their eggs or\r\n     young, expressed their solicitude by a surprising extravagance of\r\n     motion, all apparently designed to draw attention to themselves. I\r\n     was at times surrounded by hopping, fluttering stilts, all calling\r\n     loudly, waving their wings, bounding into the air to hang there\r\n     with dangling legs and beating pinions, and executing other feats\r\n     which would have done credit to acrobatic marionettes.\r\n\r\nDr. Alexander Wetmore (1925) says:\r\n\r\n     The young grow rapidly, and the increase in the length of their\r\n     legs is amazing. Until the bones are well formed the young, when\r\n     not feeding, prefer to rest with the full length of the tarsus\r\n     extended on the ground, but even then appear as tall as other shore\r\n     birds of similar body size. Stilts show considerable attachment for\r\n     their young, and, unless dispersed by some untoward accident,\r\n     frequently remain in family groups long after the young are able to\r\n     care for themselves. As the latter become strong on the wing the\r\n     family parties range over the country in search of suitable feeding\r\n     grounds. As the nights grow cold in the North the birds band\r\n     together in larger flocks and finally on some moonlit night in\r\n     September, young and old may be heard calling as they pass overhead\r\n     on their southward migration.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--Robert Ridgway (1919) describes the downy young stilt as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Upper parts light buffy grayish mottled with dusky, the back and\r\n     rump with several large blotches of black; head, neck, and under\r\n     parts buffy whitish or brownish white, the crown, occiput, and hind\r\n     neck grayish, the crown with a mesial streak of black, the occiput\r\n     with several irregular spots of the same.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage appears first on the scapulars, back and breast; and\r\nthe tail is the last to appear. The young bird is fully feathered,\r\nexcept the tail, by the time it is two-thirds grown. In fresh juvenal\r\nplumage the color pattern is much like that of the adult female; the\r\ncrown, hind neck, back and wings are brownish black, all the feathers\r\nbeing edged or tipped with \"cinnamon\"; the edgings are narrowest on the\r\nhead, upper back and wing coverts, and broadest on the scapulars and\r\ntertials; the face, sides of the head and all under parts are white; the\r\ncentral tail feathers are dusky and the others are white, washed with\r\ndusky near the tip, and all tipped with pinkish buff. This plumage is\r\nworn all through the fall and winter, with no change except by wear and\r\nfading; before winter the edgings have largely disappeared.\r\n\r\nA partial prenuptial molt of the body plumage occurs in early spring,\r\nwhen young birds become indistinguishable from adults, except for some\r\nretained juvenal wing coverts. Adults probably have a partial prenuptial\r\nmolt in early spring and a complete postnuptial molt in late summer, but\r\nthere are no well marked seasonal differences in plumage.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Doctor Wetmore (1925) writes:\r\n\r\n     Stilts feed by picking up insects on muddy shores or in shallow\r\n     water, and though not averse to frequenting alkaline areas, on the\r\n     whole prefer fresher water than do avocets. For detailed analysis,\r\n     80 stomachs of the black-necked stilt were available, distributed\r\n     from March to August, and collected in California, Utah, Florida,\r\n     and Porto Rico. Vegetable food in these amounted to only 1.1 per\r\n     cent, whereas the animal matter formed 98.9 per cent. The birds are\r\n     adept in seizing rapidly moving prey and in general are very\r\n     methodical in their manner of obtaining food. Gravel is picked up\r\n     to some extent to aid digestion, and part of the seeds taken may\r\n     have been swallowed for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe animal food consisted mainly of insects, aquatic bugs and beetles\r\nmaking up the largest items; dragonfly nymphs, caddisflies, mayfly\r\nnymphs, flies, billbugs, mosquito larvae, and grasshoppers were\r\nincluded. Crawfishes, snails, and a few tiny fishes were eaten. The\r\nvegetable food consisted mainly of a few seeds of aquatic and marsh\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The flight of the stilt is steady and direct, but not\r\nparticularly swift; the bill is held straight out in front and the legs\r\nare extended backwards, giving the bird a long, slim appearance. Over\r\ntheir eggs or young, stilts sometimes hover on steadily beating wings\r\nwith dangling legs. In their excitement they sometimes climb up into the\r\nair and make startling dives.\r\n\r\nBut stilts are essentially waders; for wading they are highly\r\nspecialized, and here they show to best advantage. At times they seem a\r\nbit wabbly on their absurdly long and slender legs, notably when\r\ntrembling with excitement over the invasion of their breeding grounds.\r\nBut really they are expert in the use of these well-adapted limbs, and\r\none can not help admiring the skillful and graceful way in which they\r\nwade about in water breast deep, as well as on dry land, in search of\r\ntheir insect prey. The legs are much bent at each step, the foot is\r\ncarefully raised and gently but firmly planted again at each long\r\nstride. The legs are so long that when the bird is feeding on land it is\r\nnecessary to bend the legs backward to enable the bill to reach the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nStilts can swim and even dive if necessary, but they are very awkward at\r\nboth, as might be expected with such long legs and the absence of webbed\r\nfeet; they never indulge in either action except in cases of dire\r\nnecessity. They are usually gentle and unsuspicious birds, much more\r\neasily approached than most large waders. On their breeding grounds they\r\nare especially fearless and demonstrative. Some of their amusing antics\r\nare well described by Mr. Dawson (1923) as follows:\r\n\r\n     While all are shouting lustily, the birds whose nests are more\r\n     immediately threatened are doing decoy stunts of several\r\n     fascinating sorts. The favorite line of effort is the broken-leg\r\n     act, in which the bird collapses suddenly, as though one of its\r\n     little pipestem legs had snapped in two. The act is performed with\r\n     such sincerity, even when the bird is standing in only an inch or\r\n     so of water, that it never ceases to be amusing. Moreover, the\r\n     trick is repeated diligently every few feet, so that it begins to\r\n     look as though the bird had taken some fakir vow to prostrate\r\n     itself every third or fourth step. The avocet, now that one thinks\r\n     of it, does the same thing; but it does it awkwardly or, as it\r\n     were, cautiously, and so unconvincingly. It has manifestly copied\r\n     from its more agile neighbor. The second line of effort, most\r\n     faithfully pursued, is wing fluttering. In this, again, the stilt\r\n     is rather the mistress. It has perfected a trick of putting up one\r\n     wing at a time and letting the wind tousle it about, as though it\r\n     were really broken. Of course it also flutters both wings, and goes\r\n     through other nondescript flopping and fluttering performances,\r\n     such as are common to the family of shore birds.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--My first impression of the note as heard on the breeding\r\ngrounds was recorded as a loud, guttural _whuck, whuck, whuck_; at other\r\ntimes it has seemed harsh and shrill. Audubon (1840) referred to their\r\nordinary notes as \"a whistling cry, different from the _cleek, cleek,\r\ncleek_, which they emit when they have nests or young.\" C. J. Maynard\r\n(1896), speaking of the breeding season, says: \"The note at this time\r\nwas quite different from that given earlier in the season, as they now\r\nuttered short syllables sounding like _put, put, put_, repeated rapidly,\r\nthat of the males being harsh, while the females gave it shriller and\r\nmore continuous.\"\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Stuart T. Danforth (1925), who made some studies of a breeding\r\ncolony of stilts in Porto Rico, thus describes their departure in the\r\nfall:\r\n\r\n     By the latter part of June the adults had begun to flock again, and\r\n     by the middle of September all the stilts at the lagoon (155 by\r\n     actual count) had formed one compact flock. This count was made on\r\n     September 17. By September 20 only about 50 were left; on September\r\n     23 there were 20; on September 27 and September 30, 16; on October\r\n     7, 5. After that none were seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--The United States, and Central and South America.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--North to Oregon (Klamath Lake, Burns and Malheur\r\nLake); Utah (Brigham and Salt Lake City); Colorado (San Luis Lake and\r\nFort Garland); Louisiana (Black Bayou, Calcasieu, Abbeville, and\r\nVermilion Bay); and Florida (Titusville). East to Florida (Titusville,\r\nCape Canaveral, Kissimmee, Eden, and Lake Hicpoche); the Bahama Islands\r\n(Andros, Inagua and Green Cay); Cuba (Manzanillo); Porto Rico (Guanica\r\nlagoon); Venezuela (lagoon of Savonet and Curacao); Peru (Upper Ucayali\r\nRiver); and probably Ecuador (Guayaquil).

There also is a\r\nbreeding record for Saskatchewan (Fort Qu'Appelle, June 13, 1894).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The black-necked stilt is no doubt resident throughout\r\nmost or all of its breeding range in Central and South America. At this\r\nseason it has been detected north to lower California (San Jose del\r\nCabo, Santiago, and Cape San Lucas); Sinaloa (Mazatlan and Escuinapa);\r\nTamaulipas (Matamoras); Texas (Brownsville and Refugio County); rarely\r\nLouisiana (Grand Chenier); Florida (Fort Myers); and Porto Rico.\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--Early dates of arrival are: California, Ojai, March\r\n27, Daggett, April 10, Escondido, April 13, Stockton, April 13, Santa\r\nBarbara, April 14, and Fort Crook, April 19, Oregon, Narrows, April 8,\r\nand Malheur Lake, April 17; Arizona, Palo Verde, April 4; New Mexico,\r\nState College, May 17, and Lake Buford, May 30; Colorado, Denver, May\r\n5; Idaho, Rupert, April 28; and Montana, Billings, May 19.

The woodcock nesting in Kamschatka\r\n     migrate to Japan with the advent of the cold weather, those\r\n     frequenting Mongolia to China, while those which have nested in\r\n     western Siberia and on the plateau of Tibet move down to Burma,\r\n     India, Afghanistan, and Persia. Our own winter visitors are those\r\n     birds which have bred in Scandinavia, Finland, and perhaps Russia.\r\n     Those which press on south past our islands arrive in Palestine, in\r\n     North Africa, and in Egypt. Throughout Russia the woodcock is found\r\n     nesting, extending though in diminished numbers, as far south as\r\n     the Caucasus and the Crimea. It also breeds in central France and\r\n     in northern Italy. Some of its most distant nesting grounds are in\r\n     Kashmir and Japan, while it has been found breeding in the\r\n     Himalayas at the height of 10,000 feet. In the Faroe Islands it has\r\n     occurred as a passing visitor and has also been recorded from\r\n     Spitsbergen.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--The same writer refers to a nuptial performance akin to\r\nthe evening song flight of our woodcock, of which he says:\r\n\r\n     Immediately after sunset the entire male woodcock population leave\r\n     their secluded haunts, and fly backwards and forwards over the same\r\n     line of country, uttering a peculiar cry unheard except during the\r\n     season of nesting. The notes may be termed the song of the males,\r\n     and are uttered by the birds previous to their departure for their\r\n     feeding grounds in the evening. The song commences with grunting\r\n     cries, ending up with a sharp and penetrating note repeated maybe\r\n     several times in quick succession, _pisick, pisick_. At times two\r\n     cock birds during their aerial maneuvers cross one another's path,\r\n     and then ensues a stern chase over the tree tops, the birds\r\n     uttering repeatedly their chirping cries. The \"roding\" of the\r\n     woodcock never takes place before the sun has set during the\r\n     earlier part of spring, but at a more advanced period, in May, the\r\n     birds commence their evening flights rather earlier. The flighting\r\n     is continued till deep twilight has settled over the glen, but\r\n     ceases before night. In the morning I, personally, have never heard\r\n     this \"roding,\" but it is said to be recommenced before daybreak,\r\n     and to cease previous to full daylight. The woodcock when roding\r\n     does not fly repeatedly over the same part of the wood; there is an\r\n     interval between each of its appearances.\r\n\r\n     It is said to pass over the same country three times in the course\r\n     of the evening. On the first visit it flies high and usually fast;\r\n     on the second its progress is lower and more leisurely; while on\r\n     the third and last the bird moves just above the trees.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--In the southern portions of Great Britain the woodcock is a\r\nvery early breeder, many birds nesting in March and some in February.\r\nLate nestings in July indicate the probability that two broods are\r\nsometimes raised, though this is unusual among waders. Mr. Gordon (1915)\r\ndescribes the nesting habits as follows:\r\n\r\n     The nesting ground is usually a wood, deciduous trees, being, I\r\n     think preferred, owing to the soft layer of fallen leaves covering\r\n     the ground. Close-grown plantations are rarely chosen as nesting\r\n     sites, and small belts of birch and oak are favorite nesting\r\n     grounds, provided that there is plenty of space between the trees.\r\n     It is my experience that the birds dislike dense cover in which to\r\n     nest; a few broken-down braken offer a suitable position, or the\r\n     bird may scrape out a hollow amongst the deep layers of fallen\r\n     beech and oak leaves which cover the ground beneath these trees.\r\n     The eggs usually number four, but at times only three are found.\r\n     Their ground color is normally buff colored, and they are liberally\r\n     spotted and blotched by dark reddish-brown markings. Nothing more\r\n     primitive than the nest of the woodcock can be found in the bird\r\n     world. It is merely a slight hollow scraped in the ground and\r\n     generally without intentional lining of any kind. The mother\r\n     woodcock often sits very hard on her eggs, especially if incubation\r\n     be far advanced, for she relies on the close harmonization of her\r\n     plumage with her surroundings. Sometimes I have been able to\r\n     approach to within a few feet of such a bird, and by not the\r\n     slightest movement did she betray that she was alive. As the result\r\n     of her early nesting, the woodcock has sometimes to cover her eggs\r\n     when snow lies around to a considerable depth.\r\n\r\nRev. Henry H. Slater (1898) says that the nest is \"often at the foot of\r\na young Scotch fir, or other tree.\"\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The European woodcock usually lays four eggs, but as many as\r\nsix and even eight have been found in a nest, probably the product of\r\ntwo birds. These are much like large eggs of the American woodcock. They\r\nare about ovate in shape and have a slight gloss. The ground colors vary\r\nfrom \"deep olive buff\" to \"cream buff.\" They are usually sparingly, but\r\nsometimes quite heavily, marked with irregular spots and small blotches.\r\nThe underlying markings, in light shades of drab are numerous and quite\r\nconspicuous. Over these are varying amounts of spots and blotches of\r\nlight browns, ranging in color from \"snuff brown\" to \"clay color.\"\r\nOccasionally there are a few spots or scrawls of \"bister\" or \"clove\r\nbrown\" about the larger end. Herbert Massey (1913) describes the eggs as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     The ground color ranges from the palest cream (nearly white)\r\n     through deeper cream to pale buff, yellow-buff, and the deepest\r\n     brown buff (many of the eggs of this latter type having a distinct\r\n     pink tone), speckled and spotted and blotched with yellow-brown,\r\n     dark brown, and purplish gray. As a rule, the eggs in the same set\r\n     are fairly uniform in the pattern of the markings, but occasionally\r\n     you get a set with one egg much more marked than the other three,\r\n     and in many cases you find two distinct shades of ground color in\r\n     the same set.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of 100 eggs, furnished by F. C. R. Jourdain, average\r\n43.8 by 33.6 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure\r\n=49= by 34.8, 44.9 by =36.4=, =40.2= by 34, and 43.1 by =31.6=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Incubation lasts for 20 or 21 days and is performed by the\r\nfemale only. The young remain in the nest but a short time, where they\r\nare brooded by their mother and carefully tended by both parents.\r\nSeveral good observers have seen the mother bird carry her young away\r\nbetween her legs. Dresser (1871) quotes John J. Dalgleish as follows:\r\n\r\n     I have had on three occasions the good fortune to see the woodcock\r\n     in the act of carrying her young. On the first occasion the bird\r\n     rose from my feet one day in the month of June, in a thick coppice\r\n     cover in Argyllshire, and flew with her strange burden carried\r\n     between her thighs for about 30 yards, in the manner well described\r\n     in a note in Mr. Gray's Birds of the West of Scotland. On following\r\n     her she again rose, still carrying the young one, and flew into\r\n     some thick cover. On this and the next occasion, which was in\r\n     Perthshire, the birds uttered no cry; but the last time I witnessed\r\n     this curious habit, which was on the 5th of May last, the bird made\r\n     the peculiar cry alluded to in the note in Mr. Gray's work. On this\r\n     occasion I could observe the bird more distinctly, as it was in an\r\n     old oak cover, with very little underwood, where I discovered her.\r\n     On rising she flew from 35 to 40 yards, calling as above mentioned,\r\n     and then, alighting among some grass, seemed to flutter along,\r\n     still retaining hold of the chick. On raising her again, the same\r\n     maneuver was repeated, only that the distance flown each time was\r\n     greater, but always in the segment of a circle, as if she were\r\n     unwilling to leave the rest of the brood. On returning to the spot\r\n     where she rose at first, I discovered one of these, which was more\r\n     than half grown, the quill feathers being well formed, and must\r\n     altogether have formed rather a heavy burden. On taking it up, it\r\n     uttered a cry, which was at once responded to by the parent bird,\r\n     although the latter did not again take to wing from the bushes into\r\n     which it had ultimately flown.\r\n\r\nAbel Chapman (1924) writes:\r\n\r\n     For many years a question used to be discussed as to woodcocks\r\n     carrying their young; but the matter never specially interested me,\r\n     until, on August 3, 1915, I happened to see it with my own eyes.\r\n     This was in Houxty wood, and since then I have witnessed the\r\n     performance on many occasions. During the war this wood was largely\r\n     felled for military purposes and the area thus cleared, and\r\n     subsequently replanted, has become a specially favored resort of\r\n     our long-billed friends. The annexed sketch, made there on June 15,\r\n     1920, shows exactly how the feat is accomplished. That particular\r\n     woodcock rose on the hillside a trifle above me, slowly flapping by\r\n     close in front, and looking back at me over her shoulder. What\r\n     first struck my attention was the curiously depressed tail, held\r\n     almost vertical; then the mother's feet, hanging down below;\r\n     finally the youngster, with its very short beak, pressed between\r\n     its parent's thighs. Since then I have witnessed many similar\r\n     exhibitions; indeed, in summer they are almost daily on view.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy young of the European woodcock is thus described\r\nin Witherby's (1920) Handbook:\r\n\r\n     Forehead and broad band over eye to nape light ochraceous buff, a\r\n     russet median streak from base of upper mandible to crown; crown\r\n     russet intermixed with light ochraceous buff, centre of nape\r\n     russet, sides light ochraceous buff; an irregular and interrupted\r\n     russet band from nape to uropygial tuft, another across wing; rest\r\n     of upper parts and sides of body with irregular bands and patches\r\n     of ochraceous buff and russet; from base of upper mandible to eye a\r\n     broad black-brown streak; a small patch of same behind eye; a patch\r\n     of russet on lower throat; rest of under parts light ochraceous\r\n     buff.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage is therein fully described. It is much like the\r\nadult, differing only in minor details, but can easily be recognized by\r\nthe looser or softer structure of the feathers. Practically all of this\r\nplumage, except the primaries and secondaries, is replaced in the fall\r\nby the first winter plumage, which is indistinguishable from the adult.\r\nAdults have a complete postnuptial molt from July to December and a\r\npartial prenuptial molt, involving nearly everything but the wings, from\r\nFebruary to May.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Mr. Gordon (1915) refers to the feeding habits of the woodcock\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     It feeds mainly by night on wet, boggy ground, and eats an enormous\r\n     quantity of worms; indeed, it may swallow almost its own weight of\r\n     food in the course of a single day. When the blackberries have\r\n     ripened the woodcock betake themselves to the hillsides and consume\r\n     great quantities of the fruit.\r\n\r\nMr. Slater (1898) says:\r\n\r\n     I have occasionally flushed woodcocks at night from wet rushy\r\n     fields, where they were doubtless probing the ground for worms and\r\n     larvae, occasionally turning over the droppings of cattle for\r\n     concealed beetles. But they also feed in woods to a certain extent,\r\n     turning the dead leaves over to find insects, etc. The accounts of\r\n     the extent of their appetites and of the amount of worms, etc.,\r\n     which they will put away at a sitting are surprising. These they\r\n     find in the earth with their bills, which are modified into a very\r\n     delicate organ of touch.\r\n\r\n     If the horny epidermis be removed, a number of small pits of a\r\n     hexagonal shape will be seen in the bone at the end of the bill,\r\n     remotely suggesting an incipient honey comb. In each one of these\r\n     pits a minute fibril of the olfactory nerve has its termination,\r\n     and by this means, when the bill is thrust into the soft, wet\r\n     soil, the slightest wriggle of the least living creature is\r\n     instantly telegraphed to the woodcock's sensibilities.\r\n\r\nWitherby's Handbook (1920) includes the following items in its food:\r\nEarthworms; also insects (coleoptera and their larvae, orthoptera\r\n(_Forficula_) larvae of lepidoptera, etc.); small mollusca, etc. Grains\r\nof maize recorded on one occasion in stomach, and mussels (_Mytilus_)\r\nalso said to be eaten, as well as small crustacea.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Mr. Gordon (1915) says:\r\n\r\n     During its flight the bill of the woodcock is pointed downwards,\r\n     and the wings are not extended to their full stretch. It seldom\r\n     makes sustained flights, however, except on migration. During a\r\n     shoot at Alnick a woodcock was seen to alight on the ground and\r\n     then to throw leaves over its back, presumably to hide itself from\r\n     the guns. If so, it would seem that the woodcock is one of the most\r\n     sagacious of birds.\r\n\r\nSelby (1833) writes:\r\n\r\n     The haunts selected by these birds, for their residence during the\r\n     daytime, are usually the closest brakes of birch and other brushy\r\n     underwood, and where the ground, from the deep shade, Is nearly\r\n     free from herbage; and, for this reason, thick fir plantations of\r\n     10 or 12 years' growth are a favorite resort. In woods that are\r\n     very extensive they are generally found, and abound most in\r\n     thickets by the sides of open glades, or where roads intersect, as\r\n     by these they pass to and from their feeding ground at evening and\r\n     in the dawn of the morning. Unless disturbed, they remain quietly\r\n     at roost upon the ground during the whole day, but as soon as the\r\n     sun is wholly below the horizon, they are in full activity, and\r\n     taking flight nearly at the same instant, leave the woods and cover\r\n     for the adjoining meadows, or open land, over which they disperse\r\n     themselves, and are fully engaged in search of food during the\r\n     whole night.\r\n\r\nMr. Slater (1898) observes:\r\n\r\n     It is well known that woodcocks follow certain routes to their\r\n     favorite feeding grounds in the evening, as they also have\r\n     preferences for certain woods and certain parts of woods to lie in\r\n     during the day. In short, they are very peculiar and fanciful in\r\n     their tastes, and are guided by circumstances not apparent to us in\r\n     their liking for one place rather than for another which seems to\r\n     our eyes to offer the same advantages. A wood above my father's\r\n     late house, in Northumberland, was a regular passing place for\r\n     cocks, and at dusk on any April or May evening a sight of half a\r\n     dozen at least was a certainty, as they passed rapidly above the\r\n     trees, announced, long before they themselves were visible, by\r\n     their peculiar half squeak, half whistle. I have here seen them\r\n     \"tilting\" in the air in the manner described by St. John and\r\n     others. It has been suggested that this tilting (at which time they\r\n     tumble and twirl about in the air in pairs and threes, apparently\r\n     prodding at one another with their bills) is connected with\r\n     pairing, but I can not think so, as I have witnessed it as late as\r\n     the end of May. I rather think it is pure playfulness, as of\r\n     children just out of school, after lying concealed and quiet most\r\n     of the day.\r\n\r\nAccording to Yarrell (1871), woodcocks sometimes become exhausted and\r\nfall into the sea on their migrations; but they do not always perish,\r\nfor he says:\r\n\r\n     A woodcock when flushed on the coast has been known to settle on\r\n     the sea, and when again disturbed rose without difficulty and flew\r\n     away. Numerous instances are recorded of woodcocks alighting on the\r\n     decks of ships in the English Channel and elsewhere. The rapidity\r\n     of flight of this bird is at times so great that a pane of plate\r\n     glass more than three-eighths of an inch thick has been smashed by\r\n     the contact, and one was actually impaled on the weather cock of\r\n     one of the churches in Ipswich.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Mr. Slater (1898), writing of the fall migration in Great\r\nBritain, says:\r\n\r\n     Though many breed with us, there is a large migration from the\r\n     North in the late autumn. If the moon is full about the end of\r\n     October, they appear to come in a big \"rush\" then, but sometimes in\r\n     driblets as early as the end of September, as late as mid-November.\r\n     But their movements are largely influenced by the wind and\r\n     atmosphere as well as the moon; if the weather is foggy or they are\r\n     exhausted by a heavy contrary wind, they drop on the coast as soon\r\n     as they touch it, and large bags are sometimes made on the sand\r\n     hills by those on the lookout for them. If the wind is light and\r\n     weather clear, they seem to pass inland at once to favorite and\r\n     suitable covers. Should frost come--which drives the worms down,\r\n     and also prevents the birds from probing--cock move south and west.\r\n     Therefore, it is in our southwest counties, Wales and West Ireland,\r\n     where, owing to the Gulf stream frost and cold are seldom severe,\r\n     that the best woodcock shooting is to be had, after the seasonal\r\n     migration is over. Though they travel as a rule at night, and\r\n     chiefly at the time of the full moon, this is not invariably the\r\n     case; on October 28, 1881, I saw a woodcock come straight in from\r\n     the sea, 20 yards high, and pitch on a bare patch of shingle; this\r\n     was shortly before midday, and I thought it such an unusual\r\n     circumstance that I skinned the bird for my collection.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--The woodcock is a winter resident as well as a migrant in\r\nGreat Britain. Dresser (1871) writes:\r\n\r\n     Their numbers are, of course, greatly augmented in the winter,\r\n     large numbers of immigrants being added to those which breed (as\r\n     after mentioned); indeed I am not sure whether all of those we have\r\n     in winter are immigrants, and that those which breed with us move\r\n     further south in pursuance of their migratory instinct; but this is\r\n     a point very difficult to discover. In the district I now allude\r\n     to, their numbers are much diminished on the appearance of severe,\r\n     frosty weather, when they appear to go to the coast, where they\r\n     find the feeding grounds more open; if, however, the frost be\r\n     slight, they remain.\r\n\r\n     On the west coast of Argyllshire they are found in greater\r\n     numbers, and are not so much confined to covers, being found in\r\n     open weather scattered through all the sheltered glens where there\r\n     is any brushwood or even bracken. On the occurrence of frost,\r\n     however, they all gather to the low-lying covers near the sea,\r\n     where its influence serves to keep open the springs; and in such\r\n     weather very large bags are often made, as they seem to come not\r\n     only from the outlying spots above mentioned, but from the inland\r\n     districts, where the frost has sealed up every one of their usual\r\n     haunts.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--Northern Europe and Asia. North in Scandinavia to\r\nlatitude 67°, in Lapland and Finland, in western Russia to 65°, and in\r\neastern Russia to 64°. East to the Sea of Okhotsk. West to the British\r\nIsles. South to the Azores, Canaries, and Madeira (where it is\r\nresident), the Pyrenees, Alps, Transylvania, Carpathians, Himalayas (up\r\nto 10,000 feet), Mongolia, and Japan.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--Great Britain, the Mediterranean basin, northern Africa\r\nand southern Asia, Persia, India, Burma, China, Japan, and occasionally\r\nCeylon.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--Casual in the Faeroes, Spitsbergen, Greenland, and\r\nNorth America. Prof. Wells W. Cooke (1912) says:\r\n\r\n     It wanders occasionally to eastern North America, and has occurred\r\n     in Loudoun County, Va., in 1873 (Coues); Chester County, Pa., the\r\n     end of November, 1886 (Stone); one was taken near Shrewsbury, N.\r\n     J., December 6, 1859 (Lawrence); one, September, 1889, somewhere in\r\n     New Jersey (Warren); one, probably of this species, near Newport,\r\n     R. I. (Baird, Brewer, and Ridgway); one at Chambly, Quebec,\r\n     November 11, 1882 (Wintle); and one at St. John, Newfoundland,\r\n     January 9, 1862 (Sclater).\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Great Britain: 29 records, March 9 to August 5; 15\r\nrecords, April 18 to June 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUBICOLA MINOR (Gmelin)\r\n\r\nAMERICAN WOODCOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThis mysterious hermit of the alders, this recluse of the boggy\r\nthickets, this wood nymph of crepuscular habits is a common bird and\r\nwell distributed in our Eastern States, widely known, but not intimately\r\nknown. Its quiet retiring habits do not lead to human intimacy. It may\r\nlive almost in our midst unnoticed. Its needs are modest, its habitat is\r\ncircumscribed, and it clings with tenacity to its favorite haunts even\r\nwhen closely encroached upon by civilization. The banks of a stream\r\nrunning through my place, close to the heart of the city, were once\r\nfamous woodcock covers in which the birds persisted long after the\r\nsurroundings were built up; and even within recent years I have had a\r\npair of woodcocks living in the shrubbery along the stream for a week or\r\ntwo at a time.\r\n\r\nWho knows where to look for woodcocks? Their haunts are so varied that\r\none may not be surprised to find them almost anywhere, especially on\r\nmigrations. Flight birds are here to-day and gone to-morrow. Their\r\nfavorite resorts are alder thickets along the banks of meandering\r\nstreams or spring-fed boggy runs; rich bottom lands or scrubby hollows,\r\novergrown with willows, maples, alders, and poison sumac; or the scrubby\r\nedges of damp, second-growth woods, mixed with birches; any such place\r\nwill suit them where they can find moist soil, not too wet or too sour,\r\nwell supplied with earthworms. During the hot, sultry weather of July\r\nand August, the molting season, they seek the seclusion of cool, moist,\r\nleafy woods or dense thickets; or they may resort to the cool hillside\r\nor mountain bogs, fed by cool springs; or, if the weather is very dry,\r\nthey may be found in the wet grassy meadows. Woodcocks do not like too\r\nmuch water and, after heavy rains, they may be driven from their usual\r\ncovers to well-drained hillsides, sparsely covered with small birches,\r\nmaples, locusts, and cedars. Sometimes they are found on the tops of\r\nmountains; George B. Sennett (1887) saw a pair on the top of Roan\r\nMountain in North Carolina, at an elevation of 6,000 feet, \"in a clump\r\nof balsams; the overflow from numerous springs which had their sources\r\nat this spot formed an open, adjoining marsh of several acres.\"\r\n\r\nWoodcocks often appear in unexpected places, such as city parks, yards,\r\ngardens, orchards, or even lawns. John T. Nichols writes to me:\r\n\r\n     A neighbor (Mr. W. S. Dana) called for me at about 10 o'clock in\r\n     the morning of a sparklingly clear, rather cool summer's day, to\r\n     show me a woodcock that was feeding on his lawn, which slopes down\r\n     to an almost fresh water arm of Moriches Bay. We found the bird\r\n     still busily engaged where he had left it. It was out in the bright\r\n     sunlight, crouched, walking about slowly but continuously. It held\r\n     its body in an unsteady wavering manner, and was picking and\r\n     digging about the roots of the short grass stubble, apparently\r\n     obtaining some food too small for us to determine. The piece of\r\n     lawn where the bird was operating was low and flat, adjacent to the\r\n     edge of the water where protected by a low bulkhead. The ground was\r\n     slightly moist, perhaps from seepage, which may have accounted for\r\n     its presence. It was remarkably unsuspicious, allowing us to crawl\r\n     within 2 or 3 yards, before flying back to alight under the shade\r\n     of near-by trees; but was a full-grown bird, strong on the wing.\r\n\r\nI have, more than once, seen a woodcock crouching in the short grass\r\nbeside a country road, quite unconcerned as I drove past. I have\r\nfrequently seen one in my yard about the shrubbery and I remember seeing\r\nmy father stand on his front piazza and shoot one that was standing\r\nunder an arborvitae hedge. Moist cornfields are often favorite resorts\r\nfor woodcocks in summer.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The woodcock is the first of our waders to migrate north and\r\none of the earliest of all our migrants, coming with the bluebirds and\r\nthe robins, as soon as winter has begun to loosen its grip. The date\r\ndepends on the weather and is very variable, for the bird must wait for\r\na thaw to unlock its food supply in the bogs and spring holes. Walter H.\r\nRich (1907) has known the woodcock to arrive in Maine as early as\r\nFebruary 10, and says that early birds find a living about the big ant\r\nhills, until the alder covers are ready for them.\r\n\r\nIn Audubon's (1840) time the migration must have been very heavy, for he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     At the time when the woodcocks are traveling from the south toward\r\n     all parts of the United States, on their way to their breeding\r\n     places, these birds, although they migrate singly, follow each\r\n     other with such rapidity, that they may be said to arrive in\r\n     flocks, the one coming directly in the wake of the other. This is\r\n     particularly observable by a person standing on the eastern banks\r\n     of the Mississippi or the Ohio, in the evening dusk, from the\r\n     middle of March to that of April, when almost every instant there\r\n     whizzes past him a woodcock, with a velocity equaling that of our\r\n     swiftest birds. See them flying across and low over the broad\r\n     stream; the sound produced by the action of their wings reaches\r\n     your ear as they approach, and gradually dies away after they have\r\n     passed and again entered the woods.\r\n\r\nNo such flights can be seen to-day, but we occasionally have a\r\ncomparatively heavy migration; such a flight occurred in 1923 and is\r\nthus described in some notes from Edward H. Forbush:\r\n\r\n     The most remarkable occurrence of the past two months was the\r\n     prevalence of migrating woodcocks over a large part of southern New\r\n     England and along the coastal regions to Nova Scotia. The first\r\n     woodcock was reported in Massachusetts the last week in February\r\n     and from the first week in March onward woodcocks were noted in\r\n     slowly increasing numbers over a large part of New England. From\r\n     March 22 to the first week in April the number of these birds\r\n     scattered through Connecticut and eastern Massachusetts was\r\n     remarkable. At evening one could find them almost anywhere. They\r\n     were seen in the most unlikely places even in daylight. They were\r\n     in all the towns around Boston and in the suburbs of the city\r\n     itself, and west at least to the Connecticut Valley they were even\r\n     more numerous in the woods and swamps. In southern New England at\r\n     this time a large part of the snow had gone and in going had thawed\r\n     the ground so that no frost remained and the woodcocks could find\r\n     earthworms almost everywhere. Farther north there was not only\r\n     frost in the ground but there was deep snow and the birds could\r\n     find no food.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--The woodcock may be found by those who seek him and know\r\nhis haunts, but it is only for a short time during the breeding season,\r\nthat he comes out into the open and makes himself conspicuous. His\r\nspectacular evening song-flight has been seen by many observers, and\r\nnumerous writers have referred to it or described it more or less fully.\r\nWilliam Brewster (1894) has given us the best and most complete account\r\nof it, but it is too long to quote in full here. I prefer to give my own\r\nversion of it. The time to look and listen for it is during the laying\r\nand incubation period--say the month of April in Massachusetts, earlier\r\nfarther south, even December and January in the Gulf States. The\r\nperformance usually begins soon after sunset, as twilight approaches. On\r\ndark nights it ceases about when the afterglow finally disappears in the\r\nwestern sky; and it begins again in the morning twilight, lasting from\r\ndawn to broad daylight. On moonlight nights it is often continued\r\nthrough much or all of the night. The woodcock's nest is usually in some\r\nswampy thicket or on the edge of the woods, near an open pasture, field,\r\nor clearing; and here in the nearest open space, preferably on some\r\nknoll or low hillside within hearing of his sitting mate, the male\r\nwoodcock entertains her with his thrilling performance. Sometimes, but\r\nnot always, he struts around on the ground, with tail erect and spread,\r\nand with bill pointing downwards and resting on his chest. More often he\r\nstands still, or walks about slowly in a normal attitude, producing at\r\nintervals of a few seconds two very different notes--a loud, rasping,\r\nemphatic _zeeip_--which might be mistaken for the note of the nighthawk,\r\nand a soft guttural note, audible at only a short distance, like the\r\ncroak of a frog or the cluck of a hen. Suddenly he rises, and flies off\r\nat a rising angle, circling higher and higher, in increasing spirals,\r\nuntil he looks like a mere speck in the sky, mounting to a height of 200\r\nor 300 feet; during the upward flight he whistles continuously,\r\ntwittering musical notes, like _twitter_, _itter_, _itter_, _itter_,\r\nrepeated without a break. These notes may be caused by the whistling of\r\nhis wings, but it seems to me that they are vocal. Then comes his true\r\nlove song--a loud, musical, three-syllable note--sounding to me like\r\n_chicharee_, _chicharee_, _chicharee_ uttered three times with only a\r\nslight interval between the outbursts; this song is given as the bird\r\nflutters downward, circling, zigzagging, and finally volplaning down to\r\nthe ground at or near his starting point. He soon begins again on the\r\n_zeeip_ notes and the whole act is repeated again and again. Sometimes\r\ntwo, or even three, birds may be performing within sight or hearing;\r\noccasionally one is seen to drive another away.\r\n\r\nThe performance has been similarly described by several others with\r\nslight variations. Mr. Brewster (1894) refers to what I have called the\r\n_zeeip_ note as _paap_ and the soft guttural note as _p'tul_, and says\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n\"Each _paap_ was closely preceded by a _p'tul_, so closely at times that\r\nthe two sounds were nearly merged.\"\r\n\r\nHe counted the _paaps_ as \"uttered consecutively 31, 21, 37, 29, and 28\r\ntimes.\"\r\n\r\nDescribing the action in detail, he says:\r\n\r\n     At each utterance of the _paap_ the neck was slightly lengthened,\r\n     the head was thrown upward and backward (much in the manner of a\r\n     least flycatcher's while singing), the bill was opened wide and\r\n     raised to a horizontal position, the wings were jerked out from the\r\n     body. All these movements were abrupt and convulsive, indicating\r\n     considerable muscular effort on the part of the bird. There was\r\n     perhaps also a slight twitching of the tail, but this member was\r\n     not perceptibly raised or expanded. The return of the several parts\r\n     to their respective normal positions was quite as sudden as were\r\n     the initial movements. The forward recovery of the head was well\r\n     marked. The opening and shutting of the bill strongly suggested\r\n     that of a pair of tongs. During the emission of the _paap_ the\r\n     throat swelled and its plumage was ruffled, but neither effect was\r\n     more marked than with any of our small birds while in the act of\r\n     singing.\r\n\r\n     The mouth opened to such an extent that I could look directly down\r\n     the bird's throat, which appeared large enough to admit the end of\r\n     one's forefinger. The lateral distension of the mouth was\r\n     especially striking.\r\n\r\nReferring to the song flight, he says: \"Two flights, which I timed from\r\nthe start to the finish, lasted, respectively, 57 and 59 seconds, the\r\nsong 11 and 12 seconds, respectively.\" During the flight he followed him\r\nwith a glass and \"made out distinctly that while singing he alternately\r\nflapped his wings (several times in succession) and held them extended\r\nand motionless.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis H. Allen has sent me the following notes on his impression of\r\nthe song:\r\n\r\n     In all that has been written of this wonderful performance of the\r\n     woodcock's, I do not remember to have seen any full description of\r\n     the song itself; the peeping, or _peenting_, on the ground, with\r\n     the alternating water-dropping sounds and the accompaniment of\r\n     head-jerking and wing-lifting has been described at length, as well\r\n     as the remarkable spiral ascent into the air on whistling wings;\r\n     but the character of the actual song, which is uttered at the\r\n     summit of the ascent and as the bird comes down, is worth a little\r\n     more attention. It begins in a confused series of chipping whistles\r\n     which convey the impression of coming from at least three birds at\r\n     once. These soon resolve themselves into groups of four to\r\n     six--usually four in my experience--descending notes, the groups\r\n     alternating with groups of high-pitched wing-whistles. These song\r\n     notes vary in sweetness with different individuals, but are often\r\n     very clear and musical. Not the least interesting aspect of the\r\n     woodcock's evening hymn is the fact that so stolid appearing a bird\r\n     should be moved by the fervor of courtship to execute so elaborate\r\n     and exciting a performance. The excitement attending the affair as\r\n     far as the spectator, or rather listener, is concerned lies to\r\n     great extent in the wing whistling. When the woodcock first rises,\r\n     the whistle is comparatively low, but as he mounts, the pitch rises\r\n     and the rapidity of production increases. It is a steady succession\r\n     of very short whistling notes for some time, but, when the bird and\r\n     the whistle both reach their height, it comes in short groups of\r\n     extremely rapid whistles alternating with brief intervals of\r\n     motionless wings, as if the performer were breathless with\r\n     excitement and effort and could not sustain his flight for long at\r\n     a time. This is the effect, I mean. Probably the bird finds it easy\r\n     enough, for he makes his flight at comparatively short intervals\r\n     and during his periods of rest he is hard at work producing his\r\n     harsh and unmusical nighthawk-like _peent_ notes which involve a\r\n     deal of muscular effort.\r\n\r\nLynds Jones (1909) says that \"the bird floats downward by a crooked\r\npath, the while calling in coaxing tones _p chuck tuck cuck oo_, _p\r\nchuck tuck cuckoo_, uttered more slowly at first, regularly increasing\r\nin rapidity until the notes are almost a wheedling call.\" Isador S.\r\nTrostler (1893) describes a feature of the courtship which I have not\r\nseen mentioned elsewhere; he writes:\r\n\r\n     The birds often play in a very droll manner, running round and\r\n     round each other in a small circle, their feathers ruffled, their\r\n     wings lifted, and their long bills pointing nearly directly upward,\r\n     with their heads resting on their backs.\r\n\r\n     Sometimes they will hop on one foot, holding the other at a queer\r\n     angle, as if it had been broken or hurt. The male bird utters a\r\n     low indescribable sound during all the playing, and the sight of\r\n     these queer antics is worth more than to have seen Modjeska or\r\n     Barrett in their celebrated plays.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The nesting sites of the woodcock are almost as varied as\r\nits haunts at other times. I have never known how or where to look for\r\nits nest; in over 40 years of field work I have seen but one nest with\r\neggs. That was shown to me by Mrs. Mary M. Kaan, in Chestnut Hill,\r\nMassachusetts, on June 2, 1924. It was located where I should never have\r\nthought of looking for one, in an open, rocky hollow in open woods,\r\nwithin 50 feet of a bridle path on one side and about the same distance\r\nfrom a swampy ravine and brook on the other side. The nest was on a\r\nlittle hummock, surrounded by herbage about a foot high; it was a mere\r\nhollow in the ground lined with dead leaves. Although it was in fairly\r\nplain sight, it was a long time before I could see the sitting bird,\r\neven when it was pointed out to me. The bird sat like a rock, as this\r\nspecies usually does, while I took a series of photographs of it, moving\r\ngradually nearer. I even removed two leaves which were resting on her\r\nbill, and Mrs. Kaan stroked her on the back before she left. The nest\r\nheld only three eggs, which were probably a second laying.\r\n\r\nThe usual nesting sites are in alder runs, swampy thickets, brushy\r\ncorners in pastures, or in underbrush or tall weeds along the edges of\r\nwoods. Woodcocks are early breeders and it sometimes happens that nests\r\nare buried under late falls of snow; in such cases the birds continue to\r\nsit as long as it is possible to do so. The nest is often placed at the\r\nfoot of a small tree or bush, occasionally beside a log or stump or even\r\nunder fallen brush. An abundance of fallen leaves seems to be an\r\nessential requirement, of which the nest is usually made and among which\r\nthe bird relies on its protective coloration for concealment; but its\r\nbig black eyes sometimes reveal it.\r\n\r\nL. Whitney Watkins (1894) found a nest near Manchester, Michigan, in\r\nheavy timber, and within a few feet of a reed-bordered, springy spot, it\r\nwas within 2 feet of an ovenbird's nest. Another nest he describes as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     The old bird, curiously enough, had selected for her nesting site\r\n     an open spot where some fallen boughs had partially decayed, and\r\n     within 5 feet of a picket fence enclosing an open pasture field.\r\n     Opposite her on the other side, were ash, elm, oak, and other\r\n     trees, of no considerable size, and round about were many\r\n     frost-dried stems of aster and goldenrod, interspersed with the\r\n     fallen leaves of the previous summer. Little of green was near.\r\n\r\nE. G. Taber (1904) found a nest that was situated in a swampy corner of\r\na field planted with corn, only 6 feet from the open, on a slightly\r\nraised portion of the ground. This corner was overgrown with black ash,\r\nsoft maple, tag alders, and ferns, mingled with poison ivy. Mr. Brewster\r\n(1925) describes two, of several, nests found near Umbagog Lake, Maine,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     One, containing four eggs, incubated perhaps as many days, was in\r\n     the face of a low mound partially overarched by balsam shrubs\r\n     surrounded on every side by pools of water, and some 80 yards from\r\n     the lake shore near the middle of swampy, second-growth woods made\r\n     up chiefly of aspen, red cherry, and yellow birch trees, 20 or 30\r\n     feet in height, beneath which grew alders rather abundantly. The\r\n     female woodcock flew up from her eggs at least 15 feet in advance\r\n     of me, and whistling faintly soared off over the tree tops to be\r\n     seen no more. I flushed a male about 50 yards from this nest.\r\n\r\nOf the other he says:\r\n\r\n     It was at the edge of a little fern-grown opening, on a mound\r\n     covered with brakes flattened and bleached by winter snows, beneath\r\n     a balsam scarce 2 feet high, and not dense enough to afford much\r\n     concealment for the eggs which, indeed, caught my eye when I was 15\r\n     feet away, there being no bird on them.\r\n\r\nMr. Trostler (1893) writes:\r\n\r\n     Finding a nest one day, I disturbed the setting bird three times,\r\n     and again four times on the next day, and on the morning of the\r\n     third day I found that the birds had removed the eggs during the\r\n     night and placed them in a new nest about 8 feet away, where I\r\n     found the eggs. I had marked the eggs to avoid any mistake. The\r\n     second nest was a mere hollow in the mossy ground, and was in the\r\n     middle of an open place in tall marsh grass, while the first was\r\n     neatly cupped and lined with the above-mentioned vegetable down.\r\n\r\n     Another singular habit of the woodcock that I have never seen noted\r\n     is that of both birds setting upon the nest in wet or cold weather.\r\n     In doing this they huddle very close together and face in opposite\r\n     directions, and I have always noted that they have their heads\r\n     thrown back and their bills elevated to an angle of about\r\n     forty-five degrees.\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols writes to me:\r\n\r\n     On Long Island there is a favorite nesting station for woodcock,\r\n     where the woodland gives place to broad fields, separated by narrow\r\n     stands of big trees with a sparse tangled undergrowth of shrubbery\r\n     and cat-brier, and where here and there a short fresh-water creek\r\n     extends inland from the not distant bay.\r\n\r\nSeveral writers have stated or implied that the woodcock raises two\r\nbroods in a season. This would be an exception to the rule among waders.\r\nI believe that it normally nests early and that the late nests are\r\nmerely second attempts at raising a brood, where the first nest has been\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nAn interesting case of nest-protecting display is thus described by Dr.\r\nRobert Cushman Murphy (1926):\r\n\r\n     She (assuming that it was the female) would allow us to come within\r\n     a few feet before leaving her well-concealed position. Then she\r\n     would spring from the nest, pitch on the ground close by, and,\r\n     standing with the tail toward us, would raise and spread it so as\r\n     to show to full advantage the double row of glistening white spots\r\n     at the ends of the rectrices and under coverts. Next, flashing this\r\n     striking banner slowly, she would move off among the trees in the\r\n     attitude of a strutting turkey cock, stopping when we refused to\r\n     follow, and then tripping ahead for a few steps, all the while\r\n     bleating softly. The effect was astonishing; the ordinary low\r\n     visibility of a woodcock against the forest floor no longer held,\r\n     for the spotted fan of the tail had become a most conspicuous and\r\n     arresting mark.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The American woodcock lays four eggs, sometimes only three, and\r\nrarely five. They vary in shape from ovate to rounded ovate and have a\r\nmoderate gloss. The ordinary ground colors vary from \"pinkish buff\" to\r\n\"cartridge buff\" and in certain brown types from \"pinkish buff\" to\r\n\"cinnamon.\" They are usually rather sparingly and more or less evenly\r\nmarked with small spots, but sometimes these spots are concentrated\r\nabout the larger end. In the lighter types, which are the most common,\r\nthere are often many large blotches of light shades of \"vinaceous drab\"\r\nor \"brownish drab\"; these are conspicuous and often predominate. Mixed\r\nwith them are numerous small spots of light browns, \"cinnamon,\" \"clay\r\ncolor,\" or \"tawny olive.\" In the brown types these spots are in richer\r\nbrowns, \"hazel,\" \"russet,\" or \"cinnamon brown,\" with the drab spots less\r\nconspicuous. The measurements of 53 eggs, in the United States National\r\nMuseum, average 38 by 29 millimeters; the eggs showing the four\r\nextremes measure =41= by =30= and =35= by =27.5= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation is 20 or 21 days. Both sexes assist\r\nin this and in the care of the young. An incubating woodcock is\r\nnotorious as a close sitter and can not usually be flushed from the nest\r\nunless nearly trodden upon; often it can be touched or even lifted from\r\nthe eggs. The young are rather feeble when first hatched and are brooded\r\nby the parent bird much of the time for the first day or two. If flushed\r\nfrom her brood of young the female flutters away for a short distance as\r\nif hardly able to fly, with dangling legs and tail depressed and spread.\r\nIf the young are strong enough to walk, she calls to them making a\r\nclucking sound, to which they respond with a faint peeping sound, as\r\nthey run toward her; having gathered them under her wings, she covers\r\nthem again trusting to her concealing coloration. If the young are too\r\nyoung and feeble to run, she may return when she thinks it safe, and\r\ncarry them off between her legs, one at a time. Several reliable and\r\naccurate observers have testified to seeing this done; some who have not\r\nseen it have doubted it. The following account by Edwyn Sandys (1904)\r\nseems convincing:\r\n\r\n     The nest in question was on a bit of level ground amid tall trees.\r\n     The sole suggestion of cover was a lot of flattened leaves which\r\n     lay as the snow had left them. Perhaps 10 yards away was an old\r\n     rail fence about waist-high, and on the farther side of it was a\r\n     clump of tall saplings. A man coming out of the wood told me he had\r\n     just flushed a woodcock and had seen her brood, recently hatched\r\n     and pointed out where they were. I went in to investigate, and\r\n     located one young bird crouched on the leaves. It ran a few steps\r\n     and again crouched, evidently not yet strong enough for any\r\n     sustained effort. I went off, and hid behind a stump, to await\r\n     developments. From this shelter the young bird was visible and it\r\n     made no attempt to move. Presently the old one came fluttering\r\n     back, alighted near the youngster, and walked to it. In a few\r\n     moments she rose and flew low and heavily, merely clearing the\r\n     fence, and dropping perhaps 10 yards within the thicket. Her legs\r\n     appeared to be half bent, and so far as I could determine the\r\n     youngster was held between them. Something about her appearance\r\n     reminded me of a thing often seen--a shrike carrying off a small\r\n     bird. I carefully marked her down, then glanced toward where the\r\n     youngster had been. It was no longer there; and a few moments later\r\n     it, or its mate, was found exactly where the mother had gone down.\r\n     She flushed and made off in the usual summer flight.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Fisher writes to me:\r\n\r\n     On May 16, 1903, I flushed an old bird at upper end of the Eagle\r\n     Woods. She left three young on the ground, they remaining very\r\n     quiet, cuddled in the dead leaves. In a few minutes she returned\r\n     and alighted by them took one _between her legs_, holding it tight\r\n     up to her belly, and flew off into a thicket. I sat and watched the\r\n     other two young for about 15 minutes, hoping and expecting the\r\n     mother bird would return, but, she not doing so, I got tired and\r\n     left. As the usual set of eggs is four, I wonder if the old bird\r\n     carried off one when she first flushed.\r\n\r\nJohn T. Nichols tells, in his notes, of a brood found on Long Island:\r\n\r\n     This brood was found early in the morning by working painstakingly\r\n     in a narrow stand of trees where a nest was suspected. The parent\r\n     bird rose from almost under foot and fluttered away, as is\r\n     customary in such cases, with tail spread, pointing down, legs\r\n     dangling wide apart. It was perhaps a minute before the eye could\r\n     pick out four young lying motionless side by side, so inconspicuous\r\n     was their color against the background. For another couple of\r\n     minutes they lay motionless. Then of one accord rolled to their\r\n     feet and spreading their baby wings aloft, as though to balance,\r\n     walked deliberately away with fine, scarcely audible cheeping, each\r\n     in a slightly different direction. Apparently reliable reports are\r\n     current of the woodcock carrying its young, but the characteristic\r\n     peculiar labored flight, with deflected tail and widespread legs,\r\n     just described, may also easily give such an impression\r\n     erroneously.\r\n\r\nAgain he writes:\r\n\r\n     Just after sunrise on a clear morning I came upon 3 birds in an\r\n     open field. Two of them flew in different directions, one swiftly\r\n     and silently quickly disappeared, the other in the peculiar\r\n     fluttering manner characteristic of a parent when surprised with\r\n     young. As I reached the point where the two had risen the presence\r\n     of helpless young was confirmed by the actions of a bird on the\r\n     ground some 75 yards away, at the edge of the trees to which the\r\n     parent had flown. Its head up, watching me, both wings were\r\n     extended to the side, flapping feebly.\r\n\r\n     I had stood a couple of minutes scrutinizing the ground about,\r\n     when my eye alighted on a fledgling. At the same instant it rose\r\n     to its feet, raised and extended its wings to the side, and began\r\n     to walk rapidly away, calling a high-pitched _seep_! Its wings\r\n     were fully feathered, though little grown, feathers extending\r\n     narrowly between them across the back, sides of its lower parts\r\n     feathered, feathers not quite meeting in the center, otherwise in\r\n     down. Contrast its helplessness with the young bobwhite which\r\n     flies at a much earlier stage.\r\n\r\nAudubon (1840) describes the actions of the anxious mother in the\r\nfollowing well-chosen words:\r\n\r\n     She scarcely limps, nor does she often flutter along the ground, on\r\n     such occasions; but with half extended wings, inclining her head to\r\n     one side, and uttering a soft murmur, she moves to and fro, urging\r\n     her young to hasten towards some secure spot beyond the reach of\r\n     their enemies. Regardless of her own danger, she would to all\r\n     appearance gladly suffer herself to be seized, could she be assured\r\n     that by such a sacrifice she might ensure the safety of her brood.\r\n     On an occasion of this kind, I saw a female woodcock lay herself\r\n     down on the middle of a road, as if she were dead, while her little\r\n     ones, five in number, were endeavoring on feeble legs to escape\r\n     from a pack of naughty boys, who had already caught one of them,\r\n     and were kicking it over the dust in barbarous sport. The mother\r\n     might have shared the same fate, had I not happened to issue from\r\n     the thicket, and interpose in her behalf.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy young woodcock, when newly hatched, is\r\nconspicuously and handsomely marked; the upper parts are \"warm buff\" or\r\n\"light ochraceous buff,\" distinctively marked with rich \"seal brown\";\r\nthese markings consist (with some individual variation) of a large,\r\ncentral crown patch, extending in a stripe down the forehead, a large\r\noccipital patch, a stripe from the bill through the eye to the occiput,\r\na broad stripe down the center and one down each side of the back, a\r\npatch on each wing and each thigh and irregular markings on the sides of\r\nthe head and neck; the under parts are more rufous, \"pinkish cinnamon\"\r\nor \"cinnamon buff,\" and unmarked.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage appears at an early age, coming in first on the back\r\nand wings; the wings grow rapidly, and the young bird can fly long\r\nbefore it is fully grown. This plumage is much like that of the adult,\r\nbut it can be distinguished during the first summer by its looser\r\ntexture and by broader brown edgings on the wing coverts, scapulars, and\r\ntertials. A prolonged postnuptial molt of the body plumage during late\r\nsummer and fall produces a first winter plumage which is nearly adult.\r\nAt the first prenuptial molt, in late winter and spring, young birds\r\nbecome indistinguishable from adults.\r\n\r\nAdults have an incomplete prenuptial molt, involving the body plumage,\r\nsome wing coverts, scapulars, and tertials, in late winter and early\r\nspring, and a complete postnuptial molt in July and August. Fall birds\r\nare much more richly colored than spring adults.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The woodcock is a voracious feeder; its principal food is\r\nearthworms or angleworms, of which it has been known to eat more than\r\nits own weight in 24 hours. It is said to feed mainly at night or during\r\nthe hours of twilight or dusk. The worms are obtained by probing in mud\r\nor damp earth in any place where worms are to be found, including\r\ngardens and cultivated fields. The long bill of the woodcock is well\r\nsupplied with sensitive nerves, in which the sense of touch is highly\r\ndeveloped; it can detect the movements of a worm in the soil and capture\r\nit by probing. Numerous borings are often seen close together,\r\nindicating that the bird does not always strike the worm at the first\r\nstab. Probably its keen ears also help to locate its prey. It is said to\r\nbeat the soft ground with its feet or wings, which is supposed to\r\nsuggest the effect of pattering rain and draw the worms toward the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nC. J. Maynard (1896) made the following observations on a captive bird:\r\n\r\n     The floor of its house was covered to the depth of four or five\r\n     inches with dark-colored loam, in which I planted a quantity of\r\n     weeds, beneath which the woodcock could hide. I would drop a number\r\n     of worms on this soil, which, as the bird was too shy to feed at\r\n     first, had ample time to bury themselves. At times, however, I was\r\n     able to watch the bird unseen by it; then the woodcock, which had\r\n     remained hidden in the corner behind the sheltering weeds, would\r\n     emerge cautiously and walk over the ground, slowly and\r\n     deliberately, pausing every instant or two as if listening\r\n     intently. Then he would stamp with one foot, giving several sharp,\r\n     quick blows, after which he would bow his head near the ground and\r\n     again listen. Then suddenly he would turn either to the right or\r\n     left or take a step or two forward, plunge his bill into the earth,\r\n     and draw out a worm, which he would swallow, then repeat this\r\n     performance until all the worms were eaten.\r\n\r\nDuring dry spells, when the worms have returned to the subsoil, the\r\nwoodcock must seek other foods. It then resorts to the woods, where it\r\nturns over the leaves in search of grubs, slugs, insects, and larvae. It\r\nhas even been known to eat grasshoppers. Mr. Rich (1907) says that in\r\nearly spring, before the alder covers are open, it feeds on ants.\r\nFrederick S. Webster (1887) reports a singular case, where the crop of a\r\nwoodcock was crammed full of leaves of a common fern.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The woodcock is so nocturnal or crepuscular in its habits\r\nthat it remains quietly hidden in its favorite covers during the day and\r\nis seldom seen to fly unless disturbed, when it flutters up through the\r\ntrees with a weak, irregular, or zigzag flight, dodging the branches.\r\nWhen clear of obstructions, it flies more swiftly and directly, but\r\nusually for only a short distance, and soon pitches down into the cover\r\nagain. One can usually follow it and flush it again and again. Toward\r\ndusk it becomes much more active, and its shadowy form is often seen\r\nflying over the tree tops and across open places to its feeding grounds.\r\nAt such times its flight is steady and direct, with regular wing\r\nstrokes; its chunky form with its long bill pointing downward is easily\r\nrecognized. While traveling at night its flight is quite swift. When\r\nrising in flight the woodcock produces, usually but not always, a\r\ndistinct whistling or twittering sound. This has led to much discussion\r\nand differences of opinion, as to whether the sound is produced by the\r\nwings or is vocal. I am inclined to the latter theory, for I have often\r\nseen a woodcock fly without whistling, and many others have referred to\r\nsuch a flight.\r\n\r\nFew of us have ever seen a woodcock alight in a tree, but Mr. Rich\r\n(1907) refers to several instances where the bird has been seen to do\r\nthis by reliable witnesses. Once he himself shot one in the act.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Except during the spectacular song-flight and courtship\r\nperformance, the woodcock is a very silent bird, unless we regard the\r\ntwittering heard when it rises as vocal. Mr. Nichols says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     The quality of the twitter of a rising woodcock corresponds more or\r\n     less to the character of its flight. When, as is frequently the\r\n     case, the bird merely flutters a short distance to drop again\r\n     behind the screen of undergrowth, it amounts to little more than\r\n     the chirping of crickets. On one occasion when I observed an\r\n     individual barely escape the attack of an _Accipiter_, this sound,\r\n     as it rose, was less shrill and loud than often, but more rapid and\r\n     sustained, with an incisive quality suggesting a rattle snake's\r\n     alarm. When a woodcock rises through thick brush or brambles its\r\n     wings make a whirring sound not unlike that of the bob white,\r\n     accompanied by a slight twitter.\r\n\r\nMr. Brewster (1925) writes:\r\n\r\n     Many years ago I expressed in print a belief that the whistling\r\n     sound made by a rising woodcock is produced by the bird's wings.\r\n     This conviction has since been confirmed by field experience at the\r\n     lake with woodcock killed during the first half of September, and\r\n     in varying conditions of moult. Such of them as still retained or\r\n     had just renewed the attenuated outer primaries, almost always\r\n     whistled when flushed, whereas no sound other than a dull\r\n     fluttering one was ever heard from any of those not thus equipped.\r\n     Hence I continue to hold firmly to the opinion that the woodcock's\r\n     clear, silvery whistle emanates from these \"whistling quills\", as\r\n     sportsmen fitly term them, and not from the bird's throat. There\r\n     are, however, certain sounds, not very unlike those which combine\r\n     to form the usual characteristic whistle, but more disconnected and\r\n     twittering, which may be of vocal origin. One hears them oftenest\r\n     from the woodcock hovering, just before alighting, or flitting low\r\n     over the ground for trifling distances, beating their wings rather\r\n     listlessly. This comparatively slow pulsation of the wings might\r\n     account for the interrupted sequence of the sounds, but not\r\n     perhaps, for their seemingly throaty quality.\r\n\r\nEdward H. Forbush (1925) quotes three observers, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Mr. W. H. Harris asserts that he held a woodcock by the bill which\r\n     whistled three times with a rotary motion of body and wings. Mr. J.\r\n     M. Dinsmore held a woodcock by the body and wings to prevent\r\n     movement of these parts, and he says that this bird whistled\r\n     through its mouth and throat. Mr. H. Austin avers that he flushed a\r\n     woodcock that did not whistle, marked the bird and put him up again\r\n     when he whistled, which indicates that the bird may have made the\r\n     sound with its vocal equipment.\r\n\r\nFall.--The following from the pen of Mr. Forbush (1912) illustrates the\r\nconditions which affect the fall flight:\r\n\r\n     The flights of birds from the North have not diminished in number\r\n     so much as have the native birds. Occasionally a large flight stops\r\n     here, as in early November, 1908, when woodcock were plentiful\r\n     here, and when some gunners in Connecticut secured from 20 to 40\r\n     birds each in a day. This flight did not denote such an increase in\r\n     the number of these birds, however, as generally was believed. The\r\n     explanation is that they all came at once. The birds in Maine and\r\n     the Provinces had a good breeding season, and they must have had a\r\n     plentiful supply of food, for the autumn weather was mild, and they\r\n     mostly remained in their northern homes until nearly the 1st of\r\n     November. Flight birds were rare in Massachusetts up to that time,\r\n     and the bags were small. The fall had been warm and dry, but on\r\n     October 29 and 30 New England and the Provinces experienced a\r\n     severe northeast storm along the seaboard, followed by a cold\r\n     northwest wind, which probably froze up the northern feeding\r\n     grounds, if the storm had not already buried them in snow. Either\r\n     or both of these conditions drove the woodcock into southern New\r\n     England. My correspondence shows that this flight landed in every\r\n     county of Massachusetts except Dukes and Nantucket. As usual,\r\n     comparatively few were seen in Barnstable County. Connecticut\r\n     covers harbored many woodcock from about November 12 to November\r\n     20. There were many in Rhode Island, and the flight was noted as\r\n     far south as Delaware.\r\n\r\n_Game._--It is as a game bird that the woodcock is best known, most\r\nbeloved, and most popular, for it is a prince among game birds, and its\r\nflesh is a delight to the palate of an epicure. What sportsman will not\r\nstop in his pursuit of other game to hunt some favorite corner, some\r\nwoodland border, or some brushy hillside where he has flushed this bird\r\nof mystery before? And what a thrill he gets as the brown ball of\r\nfeathers suddenly flutters up from almost underfoot among the crisp\r\nautumn leaves, dodging up through the branches with a whistled note of\r\nwarning, and flies away over the treetops! Perhaps he was too surprised\r\nat first to shoot; but, if he marked it down, he can soon flush it\r\nagain, for it has not gone far; then, if he is quick and true at snap\r\nshooting, he may pick up the coveted prize, admire the soft, warm, ruddy\r\nbreast, the pretty pattern of woodland lights and shades, the delicate\r\nlong bill, and the big liquid eyes. An aristocrat among game birds!\r\n\r\nIn the early days, when I first began shooting, summer woodcock shooting\r\nwas regularly practiced; the season opened in July, when the young birds\r\nof late broods were not large enough to furnish good sport and were not\r\nfit for the table. Moreover, the weather was often hot and the foliage\r\nwas dense, making it unsatisfactory for the sportsmen. The only excuse\r\nfor it was that it allowed some shooting in certain sections where local\r\nbirds departed early and where flight birds seldom occurred. It went far\r\ntowards exterminating local breeding birds in Massachusetts; it was bad\r\nfor all concerned, and it is well that it was abandoned.\r\n\r\nFrom the above and other causes woodcocks have decreased alarmingly\r\nduring the past 50 years. One gets an impressive idea of the former\r\nabundance of the birds by reading the quaint shooting tales of Frank\r\nForester, in which he boasts of having shot with a friend 125 birds in\r\none day and 70 the next day before noon, and this with the old-fashioned\r\nmuzzle-loading guns. His hunting trips were joyous occasions, in which\r\nthe noonday luncheon, washed down with ample draughts of applejack, held\r\na prominent place.\r\n\r\nBy far the best shooting is to be had on flight birds, which are big and\r\nfat and strong on the wing. In warm weather they frequent the black\r\nalder thickets where there are bunches of grass and weeds, or the\r\nvicinity of brooks or springs where there is a growth of alders,\r\nwillows, and birches. On crisp, cold days in October they may be found\r\non sunny hillsides or ridges, among birches, bayberries, or\r\nhuckleberries, on the sunny edges of the woods, in cedar pastures, in\r\nlocust scrub, or even in old scrubby orchards. For shooting in thick\r\ncover a light short-barreled gun that scatters well is desirable, for\r\nsnapshots at short range are often necessary. I prefer a light charge of\r\nfine shot, which scatters more and does not tear the birds so badly. A\r\ngood dog adds much to the pleasure of hunting and is very helpful in\r\nlocating or retrieving birds. The birds will sometimes run for short\r\ndistances before a setter or pointer, and it is often necessary for the\r\nshooter to flush his own bird, which may place him in a poor position to\r\nshoot. Therefore a well-trained spaniel, which runs around close to the\r\nshooter and flushes the birds, is generally more satisfactory.\r\n\r\nFor those who have no dog, or prefer to hunt without one, there is\r\nanother method of shooting woodcocks which can be practiced successfully\r\nby one who is sufficiently familiar with their haunts and habits. From\r\ntheir haunts on the uplands, where they rest during the day, the birds\r\nfly through the open just before dark to their favorite feeding place\r\nalong some swampy run or boggy thicket, resorting regularly to the same\r\nspot night after night. If the shooter knows of such a place, where the\r\nbirds are fairly plentiful, he can station himself there about sunset\r\nand feel reasonably sure of a few shots during the brief time that the\r\nbirds are coming in. But increasing darkness soon makes shooting\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n_Enemies._--Like other ground nesting birds, woodcocks undoubtedly have\r\nmany natural enemies among the predatory animals and birds; but these\r\nhave always existed without detriment to the species. As has often been\r\nsaid, predatory birds and animals destroy mainly the weak and diseased\r\nindividuals, which are the most easily caught; the stronger and more\r\nvigorous individuals are more likely to escape and perpetuate a hardier\r\nrace, better fitted to survive.\r\n\r\nThe natural elements often take their toll in a wholesale destruction.\r\nArthur T. Wayne (1910) relates the effect of a cold wave on the coast of\r\nSouth Carolina, February 13 and 14, 1899, when the thermometer dropped\r\nto 14° and the ground was covered with deep snow; he writes:\r\n\r\n     The woodcock arrived in countless thousands. Prior to their arrival\r\n     I had seen but two birds the entire winter. They were everywhere\r\n     and were completely bewildered. Tens of thousands were killed by\r\n     would-be sportsmen, and thousands were frozen to death. The great\r\n     majority were so emaciated that they were practically feathers and\r\n     of course were unable to withstand the cold. One man killed 200\r\n     pairs in a few hours, I shot a dozen birds. Late Tuesday afternoon\r\n     I easily caught several birds on the snow and put them into a\r\n     thawed spot on the edge of a swift running stream in order that\r\n     they would not perish, but upon going to the place the next morning\r\n     I found one frozen. These were fearfully emaciated and could\r\n     scarcely fly. Two birds were killed in Charleston in Broad Street.\r\n     It will be many years before this fine bird can establish itself\r\n     under most favorable conditions.\r\n\r\nTelegraph and other wires cause the death of thousands of birds.\r\nWoodcocks migrate at night and fly low; if they strike head, bill, or\r\nbreast against a wire it means almost certain death. Many dead birds are\r\npicked up under wires. Wires are increasing all the time and it is to be\r\nhoped that the birds will learn to avoid them.\r\n\r\nBut the main cause of the woodcock's disappearance is excessive hunting\r\nof a bird too easily killed, summer shooting in the North, and\r\nwholesale slaughter during a long winter season in the South. A good\r\naccount of the barbarous sport, called fire hunting, as practiced in\r\nLouisiana, is given by Dr. E. J. Lewis (1885), as follows:\r\n\r\n     The shooter, armed with a double-barreled gun, and decked with a\r\n     broad-brimmed palmetto hat, sallies forth on a foggy night to the\r\n     \"ridge,\" where the cocks are now feeding in wonderful numbers. His\r\n     companion on these expeditions is generally a stout-built negro,\r\n     bearing before him a species of old-fashioned warming pan, in which\r\n     is deposited a goodly supply of pine knots. Having arrived on the\r\n     ground, the cocks are soon heard whizzing about on every side; the\r\n     pine knots are quickly kindled into a flame, and carried over the\r\n     head of the negro. The shooter keeps as much as possible in the\r\n     shade, with his broad-brimmed palmetto protecting his eyes from the\r\n     glare, and follows close after the torch bearer, who walks slowly\r\n     ahead. The cocks are soon seen sitting about on the ground, staring\r\n     widely around in mute astonishment, not knowing what to do, and are\r\n     easily knocked over with a slight pop of the gun, or more\r\n     scientifically brought to the ground as they go booming off to the\r\n     marshes.\r\n\r\n     The lurid glare of the torch only extends to a distance of 20\r\n     yards or so around the negro; the sportsman must, therefore, be on\r\n     the _qui vive_ to knock the birds over as soon as they rise,\r\n     otherwise they will immediately be shrouded in the impenetrable\r\n     darkness of night.\r\n\r\n     These excursions are carried on with great spirit, sometimes\r\n     continue the whole night through, and the slaughter of the cocks\r\n     is often very great; with an experienced \"fire hunter\" it is no\r\n     unusual occurrence to bag in this way 50 couple before morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--The eastern United States and Canada.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--North to southern Manitoba (Brandon, Portage la\r\nPrairie, and Winnipeg); northern Michigan (Palmer, Sheldrake Lake, and\r\nMackinac Island); southern Ontario (Bracebridge, Madoc, and Ottawa);\r\nsouthern Quebec (Montreal); southern New Brunswick (Grand Falls and\r\nNorth River); and Nova Scotia (Pictou).

The two birds resemble each other so\r\nclosely in all their habits that this would involve useless repetition\r\nof much that I have written about the American bird.\r\n\r\nThe European snipe owes its place on our list to its occurrence,\r\nprobably casually, in Greenland. There is a specimen in the British\r\nMuseum that is supposed to have come from Canada, but its history is\r\ndoubtful. The snipe that breeds in Iceland and the Faroe Islands has\r\nbeen separated, under the name _faeroeensis_, as subspecifically\r\ndistinct from the bird breeding in Great Britain and in continental\r\nEurope. It seems quite likely that the Greenland records should be\r\nreferred to this form.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Much study has been given to this subject by European\r\nobservers and differences of opinion still exist as to how the curious\r\nwinnowing sound or bleating is produced. While the normal time for\r\nhearing this is during the spring months, it has been heard in February,\r\nduring the summer and even occasionally in the fall. Rev. Henry H.\r\nSlater (1898) writes:\r\n\r\n     Opinions differ widely as to the means by which this curious sound\r\n     is produced. Meves declared that the tail feathers were the\r\n     instrument, and claimed to have produced it artificially by the\r\n     snipe's tail feathers fastened to the end of a long stick and swung\r\n     through the air. Others hold that the tremulous motion of the tense\r\n     wing feathers is the agency; a third theory is that the sound is\r\n     vocal. The reader is at liberty to take his choice. I incline to\r\n     the last, from analogy. I have seen the great snipe go through\r\n     exactly the same evolutions at the nest, including the tremulous\r\n     wings on the descending movement, and in perfect silence; I have\r\n     watched the wood, the green, the broad-billed sandpipers, the\r\n     Kentish plover, Temmick's and the little stint, and the red-necked\r\n     phalarope, go through the same movements also at the nest, but in\r\n     these cases the noise which accompanied the descending stage of the\r\n     performance was unmistakably vocal.\r\n\r\nDr. Leonhard Stejneger (1885) was also much inclined to the vocal theory\r\nwhen he wrote:\r\n\r\n     Not only this power of the sound, but even more so the nature of\r\n     the tune itself convinced me that it originates from the throat and\r\n     not in any way either from the tail or the wing feathers, as\r\n     suggested by many European writers. It is true that the wings are\r\n     in a state of very rapid vibration during the oblique descent when\r\n     the note is uttered, but this circumstance does not testify only in\r\n     favor of the theory of the sound being produced by the wing, as the\r\n     vibration most conclusively accounts for the quivering throat\r\n     sound. Anybody stretching his arms out as if flying, and moving\r\n     them rapidly up and down and simultaneously uttering any sound is\r\n     bound to \"bleat.\" Having heard, however, from my early days, of the\r\n     wing or tail theories as the only orthodox ones, I did not feel\r\n     convinced of the correctness of my own opinion until one evening I\r\n     heard another bird of the same family produce a very similar note\r\n     _while sitting on the ground_. Referring to the observation\r\n     recorded under _Arquatella couesi_, I here only remark that the\r\n     sound was so similar as to leave no doubt whatever in my mind that\r\n     it had a similar origin in both cases. It may be that a snipe has\r\n     never been observed bleating on the ground, but the fact that a so\r\n     nearly allied bird is capable of producing essentially the same\r\n     sound while in that position is an argument in favor of the more\r\n     natural explanation of the sound originating from the organ which\r\n     in almost all other instances is adapted to that purpose.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Boraston (1903) gives an excellent account of this nuptial\r\nflight, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Another bird which the buoyant spirits of the breeding season urge\r\n     into unusual prominence is the common snipe. About the pairing\r\n     time, at the beginning of April, he may for some weeks be observed\r\n     on the wing frequently throughout the day. At such times he\r\n     describes great circles in the air at a considerable height, the\r\n     rapidly beating wings carrying him round at a high speed. At\r\n     regular intervals during this great circling flight the wings are\r\n     laid out flat, the one inside the great circle the bird is\r\n     describing being tilted up and that outside depressed. At the same\r\n     moment the tail feathers are opened out so that the sky may be seen\r\n     between them as between the fingers of an open hand. Immediately\r\n     the wings and tail are so set, the tips of the former begin to\r\n     vibrate, the tail feathers remaining rigid, and the bird strikes\r\n     off at a tangent, curving outward and slipping downward from the\r\n     normal path of its circular flight. It is this recurring tangential\r\n     deviation which causes the circle of the snipe's flight to become\r\n     so vast.\r\n\r\n     During the outward curving, downward flight the snipe's strange\r\n     humming note is heard, synchronizing precisely with the vibration\r\n     of the tips of its wings. The bill is closed when the note is being\r\n     emitted. The bird's great circular flight is thus made up of two\r\n     subordinate flights--the plain flight and the humming flight--in\r\n     regular succession. After having described three or four great\r\n     circles, the snipe reverses its course and proceeds in the opposite\r\n     direction; but it is to be observed that in its \"humming\" flight it\r\n     still works always on its \"outer edge,\" the wing outside the great\r\n     circle being invariably the one to be depressed and the one upon\r\n     which the bird turns in performing the tangential, outward curving,\r\n     downward flight. The sound made by the snipe may be nearly imitated\r\n     by laughing in the throat with the lips closed, and associates\r\n     itself in my mind with that made by the puffin when returning laden\r\n     with fish to his burrow. It is like hollow, mirthless laughter; the\r\n     expression of a wild earnest joy by sounds which to human ears seem\r\n     mournful rather than joyous, and therefore unnatural, uncanny,\r\n     weird. The snipe has another amusing trick in flight; he will\r\n     suddenly jerk himself to one side, throw his wings halfway back,\r\n     and allow himself to fall like a lopsided shuttlecock, until, as\r\n     suddenly recovering himself, he sets off again on his circular\r\n     career.\r\n\r\nSeton Gordon (1915) gives the following good description of the snipe's\r\ntail, by which the sound is probably made:\r\n\r\n     The tail feathers of the snipe are of so peculiar formation that it\r\n     may be well to give here a description of them: In the first outer\r\n     tail feather the shaft is exceptionally stiff and shaped like a\r\n     saber. The rays of the web are strongly bound together and are very\r\n     long--the longest, in fact, reaching nearly three-quarters of the\r\n     whole length of the web. The rays lie along the shaft of the\r\n     feather like the strings of a musical instrument. Other species of\r\n     snipe possess four drumming feathers, and one species has no fewer\r\n     than eight. The drumming feathers of the hen snipe are not as\r\n     strong as those of the male.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The European snipe normally lays four eggs, rarely five. These\r\nare indistinguishable from eggs of our Wilson snipe. The measurements of\r\n100 eggs, furnished by Rev. F. C. R. Jourdain, averaged 39.4 by 28.7\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =42.7= by 29,\r\n39.3 by =30.3=, =35= by 28.4 and 36.3 by =26.7= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation is about 20 days. Several observers\r\nhave reported seeing the snipe carry off her young between her legs, as\r\nthe woodcock is known to do.\r\n\r\nMr. Gordon (1915) writes:\r\n\r\n     Although eminent authorities have stated that a snipe with a brood\r\n     by her feigns lameness to distract attention, I have never found\r\n     this to be the case, the bird invariably flying off as she does\r\n     when sitting on her eggs.\r\n\r\n     One warm July day I witnessed a very charming spectacle in a field\r\n     bordering on a wide expanse of moorland. A kindred ornithologist\r\n     and myself were seated at the edge of a wall overlooking the field\r\n     when he became aware that a snipe was standing fearlessly in the\r\n     long herbage a few yards from us. As we watched her, the bird came\r\n     forward, and disappeared among some rushes bordering the wall. For\r\n     the space of a minute or so she remained hidden, and we thought\r\n     she had gone there to shelter, but presently she emerged from her\r\n     obscurity, and following her closely were two small chicks. By\r\n     comparison with the green grass these little people appeared\r\n     almost black, so dark was their downy plumage. Their mother\r\n     realized that danger was near, for she led them quickly away, but\r\n     never turned to see whether her children were following her. They\r\n     kept their position close behind her, although the pace for them\r\n     was a quick one, and they were soon lost to sight behind a ridge.\r\n     One realized how wonderfully obedient the chicks were: they were\r\n     left in the rushes at the approach of danger, their mother having\r\n     evidently enjoined them to remain concealed and without movement\r\n     until she returned for them.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--An interesting account of the habits of a tame snipe,\r\nreared in captivity, is published by Hugh Wormald (1909) to which I\r\nwould refer the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--Much of Europe and Asia. From Great Britain and\r\nScandinavia (up to 70° N.) throughout northern Europe and Siberia.\r\nSouth, mainly in the mountains, to the Pyrenees, Alps, northern Italy,\r\nsouthern Russia, Turkestan, Yarkand, and southeastern Mongolia. A few\r\nbreed in the Azores, northwestern Africa, and India. Replaced by allied\r\nforms in Iceland, the Faroes, in tropical Africa, and in northeastern\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--Great Britain, the Mediterranean basin, Madeira,\r\nCanaries, Azores, Africa (south to Senegambia on the west and Abyssinia\r\non the east), Arabia, Sokotra, southern Asia, Japan, Borneo, Formosa,\r\nand the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--The only North American record, a specimen said to\r\nhave been taken in Canada, is very doubtful. This and the Greenland and\r\nBermuda records are probably referrable to the Iceland form,\r\n_faeroeensis_.\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Great Britain: 70 records, March 3 to August 21; 35\r\nrecords, April 29 to May 25. Iceland: 16 records, May 10 to June 6; 8\r\nrecords, May 26 to June 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPELLA GALLINAGO DELICATA (Ord)\r\n\r\nWILSON SNIPE\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThe above species, with its several varieties, enjoys a world-wide\r\ndistribution and is universally well known. The American subspecies is\r\nwidely distributed from coast to coast and occurs more or less commonly,\r\nat one season or another, in nearly every part of North America. It was\r\nformerly exceedingly abundant, but its numbers have been sadly depleted\r\nduring the past 50 years by excessive shooting. Alexander Wilson first\r\ncalled attention to the characters, size, and number of tail feathers,\r\nwhich distinguished our bird from the European. But they are so much\r\nalike that it seems best to regard them as subspecies, rather than as\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The snipe is an early migrant, leaving its winter quarters\r\njust below the frost line, just as soon as the northern frost goes out\r\nof the ground, about as early as the woodcock. When the warm spring\r\nrains have softened the meadows, when the hylas have thawed out and are\r\npeeping in the pond holes, when the cheerful _okalee_ of the redwings is\r\nheard in the marshes and when the herring are running up the streams to\r\nspawn, then we need not look in vain for the coming of the snipe. Low,\r\nmoist meadow lands, or wet pastures frequented by cattle, are favorite\r\nhaunts, where their splashings and borings are frequently seen among the\r\ncow tracks. They are also found in high, bushy, wet pastures, or in the\r\nvicinity of spring-fed brooks among scattered clumps of willows,\r\nhuckleberries or alders.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--On the wings of the south wind comes the first wisp of\r\nsnipe, the will-o-the-wisp of the marshes, here to-day and gone\r\nto-morrow, coming and going under the cover of darkness. All through the\r\nspring migration and all through the nesting season we may hear the\r\nweird winnowing sound of the snipe's courtship flight, a tremulous\r\nhumming sound, loud and penetrating, audible at a long distance. One is\r\nboth thrilled and puzzled when he hears it for the first time, for it\r\nseems like a disembodied sound, the sighing of some wandering spirit,\r\nuntil the author is discovered, a mere speck, sweeping across the sky.\r\nThe sound resembles the noise made by a duck's wings in rapid flight, a\r\nrapidly pulsating series of notes, _who, who, who, who, who, who, who,\r\nwho_, increasing and then decreasing again in intensity. It has been\r\ntermed the \"bleating\" of the snipe, but this does not seem to describe\r\nit so well as \"winnowing.\" J. R. Whitaker, with whom I hunted snipe in\r\nNewfoundland, told me that both sexes indulge in this performance and\r\nGeorge M. Sutton (1923) suggested the possibility of it.\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Grinnell (1900) gives the best account of this courtship\r\nflight, as follows:\r\n\r\n     I was in a broad grassy swale, studded here and there with scrub\r\n     spruces and bordered by taller timber, when my attention was\r\n     attracted by a curious far-off song which puzzled me for some time.\r\n     Finally I descried the producer, a Wilson's snipe, so far overhead\r\n     as to be scarcely discernible against the clear sky. It was flying\r\n     slowly in a broad circle with a diameter of perhaps 600 yards, so\r\n     that the direction of the sound was ever shifting, thus confusing\r\n     me until I caught sight of its author. This lofty flight was not\r\n     continuously on the same level, but consisted of a series of\r\n     lengthy undulations or swoops. At the end of each swoop the bird\r\n     would mount up to its former level. The drop at the beginning of\r\n     the downward dive was with partly closed, quivering wings, but the\r\n     succeeding rise was accomplished by a succession of rapid wing\r\n     beats. The peculiar resonant song was a rolling series of syllables\r\n     uttered during the downward swoop, and just before this drop merged\r\n     into the following rise a rumbling and whirring sound became\r\n     audible, accompanying the latter part of the song and finishing it.\r\n     This curious song flight was kept up for 15 minutes, ending with a\r\n     downward dash. But before the bird reached the ground and was yet\r\n     some 20 yards above it there was apparently a complete collapse.\r\n     The bird dropped as if shot for several feet, but abruptly\r\n     recovered itself to fly a short distance farther and repeat this\r\n     new maneuver. By a succession of these collapses, falls,\r\n     recoveries, and short flights the acrobatically inclined bird\r\n     finally reached the ground, alighting in the grass near me.\r\n\r\nAll of the early American writers, and many others since then, supposed\r\nthat the winnowing sound was made by the bird's wings, although many\r\nEuropean observers long ago argued that it was made by the two pairs of\r\nouter tail feathers, which are widely spread and held downward at right\r\nangles to the axis of the body during the downward swoops and vibrate as\r\nthe air rushes through them. W. L. Dawson (1923) says that--\r\n\r\n     the body of the sound is produced by the impact of the air upon the\r\n     sharp lateral feathers of the tail, held stiffly, while the\r\n     pulsations of sound are produced by the wings. At least it is\r\n     certain that the pulsations of sound are synchronous with the wing\r\n     beats. The sound begins gradually, as while the tail is expanding,\r\n     and closes with a smooth diminuendo as the tail is closing and\r\n     while the wings are sailing.\r\n\r\nN. S. Goss (1891) gives a different account of the courtship, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     In courtship, the male struts with drooping wings and widespread\r\n     tail around his mate, in a most captivating manner, often at such\r\n     times rising spiral-like with quickly beating wings high in air,\r\n     dropping back in a wavy graceful circle, uttering at the same time\r\n     his jarring cackling love note, which, with the vibration of the\r\n     wings upon the air, makes a rather pleasing sound.\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton (1923) noted some peculiar flight performances, which may be\r\nconnected with the courtship; he says:\r\n\r\n     On April 29 two birds were repeatedly flushed together; not always\r\n     the same two individuals necessarily, I presume, and not certainly\r\n     of opposite sex. But these birds often sailed gracefully over the\r\n     cattails, in wide sweeping undulations, with wings set in a manner\r\n     suggesting chimney swifts, a type of flight totally different from\r\n     any previously observed. The same stunt was many times observed in\r\n     the male bird of the pair whose nest was located. In fact this type\r\n     of display, if it were display, was so common that the usual\r\n     twitching, erratic flight was only rarely seen. I have wondered if\r\n     this may not have been a pair of birds, possibly recently mated,\r\n     though not actually nesting there.\r\n\r\n     On May 3, in a portion of the swamp near town, a new antic was\r\n     observed. A snipe, subsequently determined as a male, sprang up\r\n     close at hand, and after a few energetic, direct wing beats, put\r\n     his wings high above his body and, describing a graceful arc,\r\n     dropped toward the ground, his legs trailing, only to rise again\r\n     to repeat the performance. Never during this exhibition did he\r\n     actually touch the ground with his feet, so far as I could see,\r\n     but it gave that impression. He was clearly excited, and I now\r\n     know that such antics are a certain indication of nesting\r\n     activity. At such times the male gave forth several short notes\r\n     which may accurately be termed \"bleats.\" Occasionally the bird,\r\n     after performing this novel antic would drop to the grass some\r\n     distance away, and then fly up after a time, considerably nearer\r\n     me, making it evident that he was attempting to lure me away. Then\r\n     again, after trying these antics for a time, he would suddenly\r\n     mount to the sky, and there would follow a season of the weird\r\n     wind music--always delightful.\r\n\r\nAretas A. Saunders, in his notes, says that--\r\n\r\n     After the eggs are laid the female often answers this sound with a\r\n     long call _okee okee okee_ repeated 8 or 10 times and resembling\r\n     the \"buckwheat\" call of the guinea hen. I believe the female is\r\n     sitting on the eggs when she calls this way, for I have found the\r\n     nest by locating the position of the sound at night and returning\r\n     in the morning. The nest is usually in about the center of the\r\n     male's circle of flight.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--As with the woodcock my personal experience with the nesting\r\nof the Wilson snipe has been limited to one nest, found in the Magdalen\r\nIslands on June 18, 1904. The nest was found by watching the bird go to\r\nit in the East Point marshes. It was on dry ground in a little clump of\r\ngrass, under some low and rather open bayberry bushes, on the edge of a\r\nboggy arm of the marsh, which extended up into the woods; it was built\r\nup about 2 inches above the ground and was made of short, dead straws\r\nand dead bayberry leaves; it measured 6 inches in outside and 3 inches\r\nin inside diameter. The four eggs which it contained blended perfectly\r\nwith their surroundings and although in plain sight, they were not\r\neasily seen. P. B. Philipp (1925), who has found many snipe's nests in\r\nthe Magdalen Islands, where he says the species is increasing, writes:\r\n\r\n     The nesting begins in the last 10 days of May, and is a simple\r\n     affair. Usually wet marshy ground is selected, preferably with low\r\n     brush and grass with lumps or tussocks rising above the bog water.\r\n     The nest is a shallow hollow made in the grass or moss of one of\r\n     these lumps, lined with broken bits of dead grass and sometimes\r\n     with dead leaves.\r\n\r\nWilliam L. Kells (1906) gives a graphic account of finding a nest of the\r\nWilson snipe in southern Ontario, as follows:\r\n\r\n     On the 17th of May, 1905, as I was passing through a patch of low\r\n     ground overgrown with second growth willows, a rather large-sized\r\n     bird flushed from a spot a few feet from where I had jumped over a\r\n     neck of water. I did not see the exact place from which the bird\r\n     had flown, but the fluttering sound of her wing caught my ear, and\r\n     looking ahead I saw the creature, who with outspread tail and\r\n     wings, was fluttering on the damp earth, and with her long bill\r\n     down in the mud, was giving vent to a series of squeaking sounds. I\r\n     knew at once that this bird had flushed from a nest, and that the\r\n     object of her actions was to draw my attention from something that\r\n     she was very desirous to conceal; but a little research revealed a\r\n     nest containing four beautiful eggs. A clump of willows a little\r\n     elevated stood about 6 feet from the pool over which the bird had\r\n     flown, and midway between the water and the willows, which overhung\r\n     it the nest was placed. This was simply a slight depression made by\r\n     the bird in the moss and dry grass, and except from its concealed\r\n     situation and being a little more expanded, there was no particular\r\n     distinction between it and those of the more familiar killdeer\r\n     plover and spotted sandpiper, though the lining was probably of a\r\n     warmer texture, being of fine dry grass, while the eggs, as in the\r\n     case of all the ground nesting waders, were arranged with the small\r\n     ends inward.\r\n\r\nA Colorado nest is thus described by Robert B. Rockwell (1912):\r\n\r\n     This nest was located on (and above) the surface of slightly damp\r\n     ground at the edge of a good-sized area of very soft, boggy land\r\n     formed by the seepage under the dyke of the Big Barr Lake. It was\r\n     built in the center of a tussock of grass about 8 inches in length\r\n     and was a very neat, well-shaped, and cupped nest composed entirely\r\n     of fine dry grass. In construction it was far superior to any shore\r\n     bird's nest I have ever seen, being so compactly and strongly put\r\n     together that it was possible to remove it from the nesting site\r\n     without injury. In general appearance the nest itself is not unlike\r\n     certain sparrows' nests.\r\n\r\nA nest photographed for me by F. Seymour Hersey, near the mouth of the\r\nYukon River, Alaska, was in a very wet spot on the border of a marsh; it\r\nwas a deep hollow prettily arched over with dry grasses at the base of a\r\nsmall willow bush.\r\n\r\nThe Wilson snipe is often a close sitter and sometimes will not leave\r\nthe nest until nearly trodden upon. W. J. Brown (1912) tells of a case\r\nwhere he stroked the bird on the back and had to lift her off the nest\r\nto photograph the eggs.\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton (1923) has published a full and very interesting account of\r\nthe breeding habits of the Wilson snipe in Crawford County,\r\nPennsylvania, where he found several nests in a large, wet swamp among\r\ncattails and grasses; of the first nest he says:\r\n\r\n     The nest was beautifully situated in the center of a clump of dried\r\n     fern stalks--a clump similar to hundreds of just such little\r\n     islands near at hand but certainly admirably suited to such a\r\n     nesting site, for the eggs were almost completely surrounded at the\r\n     short distance of 4 inches by a paling of dead fern stalks. The\r\n     eggs were about 9 inches above water at this time, although the\r\n     water's depth changed constantly with every rainfall, and five days\r\n     later the outer rim of the nest was only 2 inches above water\r\n     level. Another was built upon a bit of decayed, sunken log and was\r\n     composed entirely of grass stems rather carefully laid together.\r\n     The eggs were but a few inches above the surface of the water, and\r\n     although grass stems connected the nesting site with other\r\n     vegetation the nest was virtually on an island surrounded by water\r\n     18 inches deep.\r\n\r\nAnd of still another he says:\r\n\r\n     This nest was the only snipe nest I have seen which had any real\r\n     protection from above. The nest was so placed under a dead willow\r\n     branch and some leaning cat-tail stalks that it was really\r\n     difficult to see it. The grasses composing the nest had been placed\r\n     with care and were somewhat woven about the cat-tail stalks and\r\n     other grasses standing near.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Four eggs is the normal number laid by the snipe; rarely five\r\neggs are laid. They are about ovate pyriform in shape and slightly\r\nglossy. The ground colors vary from \"buckthorn brown\" or \"Isabella\r\ncolor\" in the darkest types to \"deep olive buff\" or \"dark olive buff\" in\r\nthe lighter types, which are much commoner. As a rule the eggs are\r\nboldly spotted and blotched, chiefly about the larger end; but often\r\nthey are spotted more or less evenly over the entire surface. The\r\nmarkings are in dark shades of brown, \"burnt umber,\" \"bister,\" or \"bone\r\nbrown.\" Often there are splashes or scrawls of brownish black, or black,\r\nat the larger end. \"Snuff brown,\" \"vinaceous drab,\" or \"brownish drab\"\r\nunder spots or blotches often occur. The measurements of 57 eggs average\r\n38.6 by 28.1 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure\r\n=42.4= by 29.5, =36.1= by =29.9=, and 37.5 by =25.5= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation is from 18 to 20 days, and it is\r\nshared by both sexes. Mr. Philipp (1925) says that three birds taken\r\nfrom the nest were all males. The young leave the nest soon after they\r\nare hatched, and wander about in the long grass, where their concealing\r\ncoloration makes them very hard to find. One day, while watching snipe\r\nwith J. R. Whitaker on a large marsh near the mouth of Sandy River in\r\nNewfoundland, I saw a snipe several times go down into the grass at a\r\ncertain place. Thinking to find a nest there I made a careful search,\r\nand finally found one small downy young; but not another one could I\r\nfind in a long hunt. This moist meadow full of grassy hummocks is a\r\ngreat breeding place for snipe. Here we frequently saw snipe sitting in\r\ntrees, bushes, or on telegraph poles, uttering their loud _kep kep kep_\r\nnotes of protest. On the girders of a steel bridge that spans the river\r\nat this point Mr. Whitaker has seen as many as five snipe perched at one\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton (1923) describes the behavior of an anxious mother as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     The mother's antics so claimed my attention that I did not keep\r\n     close enough watch of the young, and eventually was unable to find\r\n     them. I hesitated to tramp about much at the time for fear of\r\n     stepping upon them. The mother bird grunted and clucked incessantly\r\n     and fell upon her side uttering weird cries, and beating her wings\r\n     pitiably. At times she would dart into the air and circle about in\r\n     great haste, very close to me and alight in the tall grass, whence\r\n     she would run gracefully away until she was again plainly in view.\r\n     As she ran about her head was held rather stiffly, and it seemed\r\n     that moving it from side to side much caused her inconvenience. In\r\n     fact once or twice a definite impression was given that she was\r\n     carrying something in her mouth, her head was held at such a\r\n     strained angle.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The young snipe in its dark and richly-colored natal down\r\nis one of the handsomest of the young waders. The upper parts, including\r\nthe crown, back, wings, and thighs, are variegated or marbled with\r\nvelvety black, \"bay,\" \"chestnut,\" and \"amber brown\"; the down is mainly\r\nblack at the base and brown-tipped; the entire upper parts are spotted\r\nwith small round white spots at the tips of some of the down filaments,\r\nproducing a beautiful effect of color contrasts and a surprisingly\r\nprotective coloration. The head is distinctively marked with a white\r\nspot on the forehead, a black crescent above it and a black triangle\r\nbelow it, partially concealed by brown tips; there is a distinct black\r\nloral stripe, extending faintly beyond the eye, and a less distinct\r\nblack malar stripe; between these two is a conspicuous, large, white,\r\ncheek patch. The chin and upper throat are \"light ochraceous buff\";\r\nbelow this on the lower throat is a large sooty-black area, partially\r\nconcealed by brown tips, these \"tawny\" brown tips predominating on the\r\nbreast and flanks, and shading off to \"pale pinkish cinnamon\" on the\r\nbelly.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage appears first on the back and scapulars, then on the\r\nbreast and wing coverts. A bird in my collection, about half grown has\r\nthe above parts well feathered and the remiges one-third grown; but the\r\nhead and rump are still downy and the rectrices have not yet started.\r\nThe juvenal plumage is like the adult, except that the buff edgings of\r\nthe feathers on the sides of the back and the scapulars, forming the\r\nstripes, are narrower and paler, sometimes almost white on the outer\r\nwebs. The body feathers and some of the scapulars and tertials are\r\nmolted during the fall, making the young bird almost indistinguishable\r\nfrom the adult.\r\n\r\nBoth young birds and adults have a partial prenuptial molt in the late\r\nwinter and early spring, involving the contour feathers, wing coverts,\r\ntertials, and the tail. Adults have a complete molt between July and\r\nOctober. The spring and fall plumages are alike except that the fresh\r\nfall plumage is somewhat more richly colored.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The feeding habits of the Wilson snipe are much like those of\r\nthe woodcock, except that it often feeds in much wetter places and is\r\nsomewhat less nocturnal. Benjamin T. Gault (1902) discovered by\r\nobservation that snipe occasionally resort to open mud flats, unmindful\r\nof the cover of darkness and that they feed at all hours of the day. He\r\ndescribes their method of feeding as follows:\r\n\r\n     The snipe seemed to select as special feeding grounds the water\r\n     line just bordering the flats, where the mud was soft and into\r\n     which they delighted in sinking their bills to the fullest depth.\r\n     And in withdrawing them they never elevated their necks in true\r\n     sandpiper style. On the contrary they kept their heads well\r\n     \"chucked down,\" so to speak, and in moving about from place to\r\n     place, which they seldom did, however, continue to hold them in the\r\n     same fashion.\r\n\r\n     In some respect their probing methods resembled the rooting of\r\n     swine--a simple, up and down forward movement, and if remembered\r\n     rightly, without lateral twists or side thrusts of any kind, and\r\n     at times exposing fully one-half of the bill.\r\n\r\n     Whether the Wilson snipe actually do resort to the so-called\r\n     \"suction\" method of procuring their food is a question still\r\n     undetermined in my mind. The glasses however brought out the\r\n     important information that the probing or feeling movements of the\r\n     bill were accompanied every now and then with a guttural or\r\n     swallowing motion of the throat, which at times developed into a\r\n     decided gulp, as though large morsels of some kind were being\r\n     taken down, and this _without the removal of the bill from the\r\n     muck_.\r\n\r\nHenry W. Henshaw (1875) describes an entirely different method of\r\nfeeding; he says:\r\n\r\n     In migrating, however, especially in Arizona and New Mexico, did it\r\n     depend wholly upon its usual methods of obtaining sustenance, it\r\n     would fare badly, since, in some sections, there is a total lack of\r\n     meadow and marsh, and then it may be seen in broad midday running\r\n     along the sandy borders of the streams, and picking up from among\r\n     the pebbles and _débris_ any tidbits in the shape of insects it can\r\n     find. It retains, however, even under these adverse conditions, its\r\n     habit of squatting, and, when approached closely I have seen it\r\n     lower its body close to the ground, shrink as it were into as\r\n     little space as possible, and so remain till I was within a few\r\n     feet, when it would get up with its well known _scaip_, _scaip_,\r\n     and, following the turns and sinuosities of the streams, endeavor\r\n     to find some little covered nook into which it could drop out of\r\n     sight.\r\n\r\nM. P. Skinner watched a snipe feeding on the muddy shore of a pond in\r\nthe Yellowstone Valley; he says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     He was about 6 inches from shore and at each stroke his bill went\r\n     in up to his eyes. The strokes were rapid like those of a\r\n     woodpecker. He covered a space perhaps 4 inches wide and 15 feet\r\n     long in an hour, getting something every half dozen strokes or so.\r\n     He was very busy there for two hours at least.\r\n\r\nEarthworms probably constitute the principal food of the Wilson snipe,\r\nbut it also eats cutworms, wireworms, leaches, grasshoppers, locusts,\r\nbeetles, mosquitoes, other insects and their larvae, and some seeds of\r\nmarsh plants.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Snipe are notorious for their erratic flight and they\r\noften, probably usually, do dodge and zigzag when they first flush in\r\nalarm, but not always; I have seen them fly away as steadily as any\r\nother shore bird. Snipe usually lie closely crouched on the ground\r\ntrusting to their excellent protective coloration, and do not flush\r\nuntil nearly trodden upon; so that in their hurry to get away their\r\nflight is erratic. When well under way their flight is steady and swift\r\nwith the occasional turnings common to all shore birds. When first\r\nflushed they generally fly low, but when flying from one part of a marsh\r\nto another, or when migrating, they fly very high. When alighting they\r\npitch down suddenly from a great height and then flutter down slowly\r\ninto the grass or drop straight down with wings elevated and bill\r\npointing upwards. They are less gregarious than other waders; they\r\nusually flush singly, but often within a few yards of each other if\r\nplentiful. They are seldom seen in flocks. John T. Nichols tells me in\r\nhis notes of a flock of seven which he saw on Long Island:\r\n\r\n     They were flying high from the east to west, the regular southward\r\n     lane for shore birds, and bunched up like dowitchers or yellow-legs\r\n     as they circled over the marsh, then slanted down obliquely (as\r\n     these other birds would have done) to alight on a piece of dead\r\n     stubble. By the time I reached them they had scattered somewhat;\r\n     four (scattered) and three (bunched) flushed from this spot in\r\n     close succession, and went off into the southwest. The migration of\r\n     the snipe may be mostly by night; it certainly flies to some extent\r\n     along the coast by day.\r\n\r\nAnd Harry S. Swarth (1922) says:\r\n\r\n     While the usual manner of occurrence was for a single bird to be\r\n     flushed, or perhaps two or three within a few square yards, there\r\n     were times when snipe were noted in small flocks, almost like\r\n     sandpipers in their actions. Groups of 10 or 12 individuals were\r\n     seen circling about through the air in close formation and wheeling\r\n     or turning in perfect unison. At such times almost the only thing\r\n     to betray the identity of the birds was the call note, uttered at\r\n     frequent intervals. At no time, however, did birds flushed from the\r\n     ground depart in flock formation.\r\n\r\nOn the ground the snipe moves about deliberately with bill pointing\r\ndownwards. If alarmed it squats for concealment before jumping into\r\nflight when hard pressed; the longitudinal stripes on its back and head\r\nso closely resemble prostrate stems of dead grass that the bird is\r\ndifficult to distinguish. Mr. Skinner \"saw one alight and run rapidly\r\nalong the ground for 20 feet, erect with head high, like a running bob\r\nwhite.\" C. J. Pennock watched one standing on a bare mud flat with \"a\r\ncontinued up and down rhythmic movement of the entire body.\" E. H.\r\nForbush (1925) writes:\r\n\r\n     The snipe can swim and dive and uses both wings and feet under\r\n     water in its efforts to escape. Mr. Will H. Parsons writes that he\r\n     shot one that fell into a little clear streamlet where later he\r\n     found it dead, under water, grasping a rootlet in its bill. Later,\r\n     on the Scioto River, as he relates, he shot another which fell into\r\n     the river, and, turning, swam back toward the shore. On seeing him\r\n     approach it dived, and he saw it grasp a weed with its bill. Wading\r\n     in he secured the bird \"stone dead.\"\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Eliminating the winnowing flight notes, which are\r\nunquestionably instrumental, the Wilson snipe has a variety of vocal\r\nnotes. The one most often heard is the familiar _scaipe_ note, a note of\r\nalarm and warning, given as the bird rises in hurried flight. This note\r\nhas been variously expressed in writing, perhaps best by the word\r\n\"escape\", which the snipe often does, unless the sportsman is smart\r\nenough to say \"no you don't,\" and prove it. \"On the breeding grounds we\r\nfrequently hear its loud notes of protest, uttered while it is flying\r\nabout or perched on some tree or post; these are in the form of a loud\r\nclear whistle, like _wheat wheat wheat wheat_ or more subdued in tone\r\nlike _whuck whuck whuck whuck_; they are always rapidly uttered and\r\nusually consist of four or five notes. E. W. Nelson (1887) refers to a\r\nsimilar note heard on the breeding grounds, as _yak yak yak yak_ in\r\nquick, energetic, explosive syllables. At the time when the bird is\r\nuttering its note, it flies along within a short distance of the ground\r\nwith a peculiar jerky movement of the body and wings as every note is\r\nuttered.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     When a bird gets up almost from underfoot, the _scape_ is at times\r\n     replaced by a series of short, hurried notes of similar character.\r\n     It is interesting to find in the Wilson's snipe this imperfect\r\n     differentiation of a note uttered at the moment of taking wing from\r\n     one uttered when in or approaching full flight--as it is a\r\n     condition slightly different from the calls of other more social\r\n     shore birds which trust comparatively little to concealment, take\r\n     wing while danger is still at a distance with hurried minor notes,\r\n     so soft as to readily escape notice, and have each a loud\r\n     diagnostic flight call of much service in their identification.\r\n\r\n      The _scape_ of the snipe has sufficient resemblance to the\r\n      woodcock's _peent_, which forms a part of the nuptial performance\r\n      of that species, to leave little doubt that the two are homologous\r\n      (that is, of the same derivation), if we assume snipe and woodcock\r\n      to be related. It is, however, more analogous (that is, of\r\n      corresponding place or purpose) with the wing twitter of the\r\n      woodcock. Its harsh quality is in keeping with the voices of\r\n      unrelated denisons of marsh and swamp, herons, rails, frogs, etc.,\r\n      and the discords of close-by bog sounds continually in its ears.\r\n      The quality of the snipe's call contrasts sharply with the\r\n      peculiarly clear, mellow whistle of the black-breasted plover, for\r\n      instance, and ringing calls of species of similar habit, with\r\n      carrying power over the open distances of their haunts. The\r\n      connecting series of limicoline voices, through the reedy calls of\r\n      such marsh-loving birds as the pectoral sandpiper, leaves little\r\n      doubt that there is a correlation between habitat and quality of\r\n      voice.\r\n\r\nIn some notes from Alaska, he writes:\r\n\r\n     July 17, on the slope of a low, gentle, tundra hill a little way\r\n     back from the shore, ahead of me a snipe fluttered up a short\r\n     distance, then down; up, then down; accompanying this performance\r\n     with _chup chup chup chup chup chew chew chew chew chew_. It\r\n     alighted in a comparatively open space with a couple of small bog\r\n     holes of water, surrounded with a circle of scrub willows, and here\r\n     I presently flushed it again. It rose with a _chape_ note, more\r\n     muffled and reedy than the ordinary Wilson snipe _scape_, and,\r\n     curving downwind, rose higher, attaining considerable elevation in\r\n     the distance, as I followed it with my glass. It now began to\r\n     zigzag up and down, maintaining approximately its position in the\r\n     sky to leeward. Meanwhile I heard an unfamiliar more or less\r\n     whistled _peep-er-weep_ once or twice, and an intermittent\r\n     winnowing sound, _wish wish wish wish wish_, etc. Being uncertain\r\n     as to whether these sounds came from the distant snipe, or from\r\n     some other bird closer at hand in the air, I took my glasses off\r\n     the former to look about me, and as I feared I should do, lost\r\n     track of it in the sky. Presently the winnowing ceased and I began\r\n     to hear a continuous harsh _cuta-cuta-cuta-cuta_ from over the brow\r\n     of the hill, which turned out to be a snipe, presumably the same\r\n     one which had returned, standing on top of the only stake\r\n     thereabouts.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The Wilson snipe should be easily recognized by its long\r\nbill, its erratic flight, its conspicuous stripes, and the rufous near\r\nthe end of its tail. The harsh _scaipe_ note is diagnostic. It might be\r\nconfused with the dowitcher, but the flight, notes, and usual haunts of\r\nthe latter are different. I have often thought that the pectoral\r\nsandpiper resembles the snipe, as it rises from the grass, but it lacks\r\nthe long bill, and is not so conspicuously striped on the back.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--The fall migration of snipe is dependent on the weather, the\r\nfirst early frosts are apt to start them along; when the brilliant red\r\nleaves of the swamp maples add their touch of color to the marshes, and\r\nwhen the vegetation in the meadows begins to take on the rich hues of\r\nautumn, then we may look for the coming of the snipe. They are by no\r\nmeans confined to fresh-water marshes at this season. I have\r\noccasionally flushed a Wilson snipe on the salt marshes of Cape Cod, and\r\nhave frequently found them on the dry grassy shores of islands in inland\r\nponds.\r\n\r\nWells W. Cooke (1914) says:\r\n\r\n     They seem reluctant to return south in fall, even though they can\r\n     have no appreciation of the constant persecution which awaits them\r\n     during the six months' sojourn in their winter home. A few migrants\r\n     appear in the northern part of the United States in early\r\n     September, and, moving slowly southward, reach the southern part of\r\n     the Gulf States shortly after the middle of October. Soon the main\r\n     body of the birds follows, and all normally keep south of the line\r\n     of frozen ground. Yet every winter some laggards remain much\r\n     farther north, feeding about springs or streams. A few can usually\r\n     be found on Cape Cod, Mass., while in the Rocky Mountains, near\r\n     Sweetwater Lake, Colorado, the presence of warm springs has enabled\r\n     snipe to remain throughout an entire winter, though the air\r\n     temperature fell to 30° F. below zero.\r\n\r\nMr. Brewster (1906) writes:\r\n\r\n     During exceptionally wet autumns snipe occasionally resort in large\r\n     numbers to the highly cultivated truck farms of Arlington and\r\n     Belmont. An interesting instance of this happened in September,\r\n     1875, when a flight, larger than any that I have known to occur in\r\n     the Cambridge region before or since, settled in some water-soaked\r\n     fields covered with crops of corn, potatoes, cabbages, etc., on the\r\n     Hittinger farm, Belmont. Learning of the presence of these birds\r\n     about a week after their arrival, I visited the place early the\r\n     next morning, but all save 10 or a dozen of them had departed,\r\n     owing no doubt, to the fact that there had been a hard frost during\r\n     the preceding night. The borings and other signs which they had\r\n     left convinced me, however, that the statement made to me at the\r\n     time by Mr. Jacob Hittinger, to the effect that he had started\r\n     _four or five hundred snipe_ there only the day before, was\r\n     probably not an exaggeration of the truth.\r\n\r\n_Game._--The Wilson snipe, improperly called \"jack snipe,\" but more\r\nproperly called \"English snipe,\" is one of our most popular game birds.\r\nProbably more snipe have been killed by sportsmen than any other game\r\nbird. It ranks ahead of all other shore birds and upland game birds\r\nexcept, possibly, the woodcock, ruffed grouse, and quail. When the\r\nstartling cry of the snipe arouses the sportsman to instant action he\r\nrealizes that he is up against a real gamey proposition. He must be a\r\ngood shot indeed to make a creditable score against such quick erratic\r\nflyers. A tramp over the open meadows, brown, red, and golden in their\r\nautumn livery, with one or two good dogs quartering the ground in plain\r\nsight and with an occasional shot at a swiftly flying bird, is one of\r\nthe delights of a crisp autumn day. The birds will lie closely on a calm\r\nday, but on a windy, blustering day they are restless and wild. It is\r\nwell to hunt down wind as the birds usually rise against the wind and\r\nwill fly towards and then quartering away from the shooter. When two men\r\nhunt along a narrow marsh, the man on the windward side will get most of\r\nthe shooting. Snipe are usually shot on wet meadows or marshes, but that\r\nthey are often found in other places is shown by the following\r\nquotations from Dwight W. Huntington (1903):\r\n\r\n     Audubon says the snipe is never found in the woods, but Forester\r\n     mentions finding it in wild, windy weather early in the season in\r\n     the skirts of moist woodlands under sheltered lee sides of young\r\n     plantations, among willow, alder, and brier brakes, and, in short,\r\n     wherever there is good, soft, springy feeding ground perfectly\r\n     sheltered and protected from the wind by trees and shrubbery.\r\n\r\n     Abbott says: \"During the autumn I have found them along neglected\r\n     meadow ditches overhung by large willow trees, and again hidden in\r\n     the reeds along the banks of creeks. I have shot them repeatedly\r\n     in wet woodland meadows. I have often found snipe in bushy tracts\r\n     and among the swamp willows, but I have never seen them in the\r\n     forest, and believe they so rarely resort to the woods that it\r\n     would not be worth while to seek them there.\"\r\n\r\nSnipe must have been exceedingly abundant 50 or 60 years ago, as the\r\noft-quoted achievements of James J. Pringle (1899) will illustrate. He\r\nwas not a market hunter but a gentleman (?) sportsman, who shot for the\r\nfun of it and gave the birds away to his friends. His excuses for\r\nexcessive slaughter and his apologies for not killing more are\r\ninteresting; he writes:\r\n\r\n     The birds being such great migrants, and only in the country for a\r\n     short time, I had no mercy on them and killed all I could, for a\r\n     snipe once missed might never be seen again.\r\n\r\n     I shot with only one gun at a time; had no loader, but loaded my\r\n     gun myself; had I shot with two guns and had a loader I would, of\r\n     course, have killed a great many more birds, but in those days and\r\n     in those parts it was impossible to get a man that could be\r\n     trusted to load.\r\n\r\nDuring the 20 years from 1867 to 1887 he shot, on his favorite hunting\r\ngrounds in Louisiana, 69,087 snipe and a total of 71,859 of all game\r\nbirds; but his shooting fell off during the next 10 years for he\r\nincreased his grand total of snipe to only 78,602 and of all game birds\r\nto only 82,101! His best day, undoubtedly a world's record, was December\r\n11, 1877, when he shot in six hours 366 snipe and 8 other birds. On his\r\nbest seven consecutive shooting days, alternate days in December, 1877,\r\nhe killed 1,943 snipe and 25 other birds. During the winter of 1874-75\r\nhe killed 6,615 snipe. Captain Bogardus, the famous trap shot, killed,\r\nwith the help of a friend, 340 snipe on one day in Illinois, and seldom\r\ngot less than 150 on good days. With such excessive shooting all through\r\nthe fall, winter, and spring, is it to be wondered at that the snipe\r\nhave decreased in numbers?\r\n\r\n_Winter._--As mentioned above snipe spend the winters in small numbers\r\nas far north as they can find unfrozen marshes and spring holes, but\r\ntheir main winter resorts are in the Southern States, the West Indies,\r\nand northern South America. They were formerly enormously abundant in\r\nthe marshes and savannas of Florida and the other Gulf States, where\r\nthey are still common in winter. C. J. Pennock tells me that they are\r\nstill abundant all winter about St. Marks, Florida, his earliest and\r\nlatest dates being September 12 and May 10. Arthur T. Wayne (1910) says\r\nthat, in South Carolina, the snipe \"are most abundant during the months\r\nof February and March, and at that time multitudes frequent the rice\r\nplantations, provided the water is not too deep over the land.\" J. H.\r\nBowles (1918) says that in Washington \"cold weather does not seem to\r\nbother them much. On January 1, 1916, when all fresh-water marshes were\r\nfrozen over, large numbers of them gathered on the Tacoma Flats.\" Mr.\r\nSkinner writes to me that in Yellowstone Park they are found in winter\r\nalong creeks and rivers kept open by warm springs and on ground\r\noverflowed by warm water from the hot springs.\r\n\r\nAiken and Warren (1914) tell of the winter habits of the Wilson snipe,\r\nin El Paso County, Colorado, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Fountain Creek rarely freezes over entirely below its exit from the\r\n     mountains, and along its banks there are many places where water\r\n     that runs through the sand comes to the surface and forms springy\r\n     holes and marshy meadows which are warmer than surface water. These\r\n     become the winter feeding grounds for the snipe and one or a pair\r\n     often content themselves with a very small area of muck. But at\r\n     times of severe cold many of the smaller holes freeze and then the\r\n     snipe concentrate at places where a larger flow of water keeps the\r\n     holes open. On January 15, 1908, with 6 inches of snow on the\r\n     ground and below zero weather Aiken visited a small beaver pond on\r\n     the Skinner ranch 6 miles south of Colorado Springs. A bit of marsh\r\n     above the pond and a short stretch of ooze along the outlet below\r\n     remained open, and in this small area of one-fourth of an acre were\r\n     25 to 30 snipe. Some years ago a snipe was found running upon the\r\n     ice when everything in the vicinity was frozen solid. A few snipe\r\n     winter along banks of streams in the mountains.\r\n\r\n     That snipe know enough to protect themselves from storms may be\r\n     illustrated by narrating here one of Aiken's experiences in Utah\r\n     about 20 years ago. He was beating a snipe marsh near one edge of\r\n     which extended a narrow arroyo or gully in which were some trees\r\n     and bushes. The weather had been fair until without warning a\r\n     heavy snow storm set in. At once snipe began to rise wildly from\r\n     different parts of the marsh and one after another directed their\r\n     flight toward the same point in the arroyo and dove between its\r\n     banks. Upon investigation 8 or 10 snipe were found together in a\r\n     little cave in the side of the arroyo that was partly hidden by\r\n     bushes so that they were well protected from any storm. We\r\n     conclude this was not the first time the snipe had resorted to\r\n     this friendly shelter since they knew so well where to go.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North America, Central America, the West Indies, and northern\r\nSouth America.

Its breeding home is in\r\nNorthern Europe and Asia, but on migration and during the winter months\r\nit has been met with in the British Isles, throughout southern Europe\r\nand Africa south to the Cape Province, as well as southern Asia from\r\nIndia westward. Unlike the common snipe, it frequently occurs singly and\r\nis by no means confined to marshy spots, but may be met with on rough\r\npastures, moorlands, and fields. To this characteristic it owes its name\r\nof \"solitary snipe.\"\r\n\r\n_Spring._--On the northward migration it is of very rare occurrence in\r\nthe British Isles, and has only been recorded on a few occasions in\r\nMorocco, but of regular occurrence in south Spain; but is not uncommon\r\non passage in Malta in April and May and occurs in small numbers in\r\nItaly in April and May and in Corfu and Epirus in March, also migrating\r\nin greater numbers along the west coast of the Black Sea. Probably the\r\nmajority of the birds which visit South Africa make their way northward\r\nalong the east side of the Continent. The northerly movement begins in\r\nNatal in January or February, so that it extends over a period of four\r\nor five months.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Observations on the courtship of this species are not\r\nnumerous, for it is nocturnal in its habits and, except during the\r\nmating season, decidedly unsociable. In western Europe there has been a\r\ngreat diminution of the breeding stock of late years. Jutland, which was\r\nat one time a well-known breeding place, has long been entirely\r\ndeserted, and it is necessary to visit the morasses of Scandinavia and\r\nEsthonia or Finland and Russia before one can make the acquaintance of\r\nthis species in any numbers on its nesting ground. Unlike the common and\r\njack snipe, there are no aerial evolutions to call attention to the\r\ndisplay, but the whole is conducted on the ground between sunset and\r\nsunrise; and as the notes of the birds are not loud, it may well be\r\nimagined that it may readily be overlooked. The number of birds which\r\nattend at the \"Spil,\" as it is called in Norway, or \"Tok\" (Russian),\r\nvaries from eight to a dozen pairs to twenty or more in districts where\r\nthe birds are comparatively common. Here late in May the males may be\r\nheard uttering low warbling notes, producing also sounds which have been\r\ncompared to those made by running the nail along the teeth of a comb,\r\nand snapping their bills together, evidently in defiance. The display\r\nconsists in expanding the tail like a fan and turning it over toward the\r\nback, the white outer feathers standing out conspicuously, with drooping\r\nwings and depressed and retracted head. In this attitude they perform a\r\nkind of dance, slowly at first, but becoming more and more rapid, and\r\ngenerally culminating in a series of fights between the rivals.\r\n\r\nR. Collett, who furnished a long and detailed description of the\r\nprocedure at one of these \"leks\" to Dresser (1871), is of opinion that\r\nthe fighting is not of a serious character and consists chiefly of\r\nfeeble slashes with the wings, but the Russian naturalist Alphéraky, a\r\ntranslation of whose interesting paper on the subject appeared in the\r\nField for 1906 (p. 1075) with an illustration of the display, describes\r\nthe ground as often strewn with feathers after these encounters. In the\r\nmore northern latitudes there is of course little darkness, but there is\r\na consensus of opinion that the display dies down about midnight and\r\ncommences again as it becomes lighter. Alphéraky ascribes this to the\r\narrival of the females on the scene. Clear and bright nights are most\r\nfavorable for this performance, which seems to have some points of\r\nresemblance to that of the ruff and some to that of the black grouse\r\n(_Lyrurus tetrix_), but a series of observations are required before we\r\ncan reconcile the discrepancies and fill up the gaps in the\r\ndescriptions. According to Collett there is a period in the display when\r\nthe bird is in a kind of ecstasy and produces a series of varied notes\r\nbeginning with a whistle or two, followed by a snapping noise with five\r\nor six notes in rapid succession, then a hissing sound, followed by a\r\nrolling _sbirrrr_, which becomes deeper as uttered. A number of birds\r\ndisplaying at the same time produces a low continuous chorus of varied\r\nsounds. This is the more remarkable as the great snipe is at other\r\nseasons a particularly silent bird, and indeed is rarely heard to utter\r\na sound of any kind, usually rising in silence.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The sites vary according to locality. In Jutland they were\r\nusually on grassy flats, but in Scandinavia generally on broken ground\r\nwith birch scrub here and there. Here the female scratches a hollow\r\namong the moss and deposits her four handsome eggs. F. and P. Godman\r\n(1861), who found several nests in the Bodö district, Norway, discovered\r\none which had an incomplete set of two eggs. On returning two days later\r\nto the spot nothing was visible but some disarranged bits of moss.\r\nAlarmed by their approach the bird flew off, leaving a hole in the moss\r\nthrough which the eggs were visible. On a third visit the bird was found\r\nincubating the two eggs, which were on the point of hatching, and was\r\ncovered with fragments of moss which she had evidently torn up and\r\nthrown over herself. None of the other nests found were concealed in any\r\nway.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--These are normally four in number, though occasionally three\r\nmay be met with. They are pyriform in shape with a pale stone colored\r\nground and boldly spotted and blotched with dark umber, shading into\r\nblack and numerous ashy gray shell markings. The markings are usually\r\ndenser and more concentrated at the big end, often with a tendency to a\r\nzone. The measurements of 100 eggs from northern Europe (69 by the\r\nwriter, 19 by Goebel, and 12 by Rey) average 45.3 by 31.8 millimeters;\r\nthe eggs showing the four extremes measure =48.8= by 31.9, 46.2 by\r\n=33.3=, =41.2= by 31.7, and 46.5 by =29.5= millimeters. Rey (1905) gives\r\nthe average weight as 1.107 g. and Goebel as 1.035 g.\r\n\r\n_Young._--As to the share of the sexes in incubation our information is\r\nscanty; but, such as it is, goes to prove that it is conducted by the\r\nfemale alone. Naumann (1887) gives the period as 17 to 18 days and\r\nstates that as soon as the young are dried they leave the nest and take\r\nto the long grass which effectually conceals them.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The reader is referred to A Practical Handbook of British\r\nBirds, edited by H. F. Witherby (1920), where a complete account of the\r\nplumages and molts of this species is given.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Naumann (1887) records small worms, insect larvae, small\r\nsnails, coleoptera, water insects, and larvae of Phryganeidae. Yarrell\r\n(1871) includes larvae of insects, especially Tipulidae, and small slugs\r\nas well as worms. These last seem to form the staple diet.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The family parties soon break up and from late autumn to\r\nits arrival on the breeding grounds it is more likely to be met with\r\nsingly than in company. Its flight is not so rapid as that of the common\r\nsnipe, but slower and more direct, while instead of uttering the well\r\nknown _scape_, it either rises in silence or merely utters a guttural\r\ncroaking note.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--More frequently met with in the British Isles on the autumn\r\nmigration from the end of July to mid-November than in spring, but\r\nprobably frequently overlooked. By the beginning of August the young are\r\nfull grown normally, and gradually make their way from the high north in\r\nNorway southward, the majority of migrants taking an easterly course and\r\nonly a small proportion moving south-westward to the winter quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--Norway, north to Tromsö, Sweden, to latitude 65° N.,\r\nformerly in Denmark but now extinct, as also in Schleswig. It is said to\r\nhave bred formerly in Holland and still does so in East Prussia and\r\neastward to Estonia, Finland, Russia, according to Buturlin, up to\r\nlatitude 63° near the Great Lakes, 65-1/2° on the White Sea, and 67-1/2°\r\nin the Petchora, while southward it is said to breed in Bessarabia\r\n(Rumania) and in the Governments of Kieff, Poltava, Kharkoff, and\r\nVoronsh, and to 51-1/2° N. in the Urals as well as in the Caucasus. In\r\nAsia it breeds near Omsk, in the Altai and the tributaries of the Ob,\r\nbut not beyond the Yenesei or in East Siberia.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--Cape Province, Natal, Transvaal (September to March),\r\nDamara Land, Bechuana Land, Portuguese East Africa, Southwest Africa,\r\nPersia, Turkestan, and India (once).\r\n\r\n_Migration._--River Zambesi, Egypt (not uncommon), Alexandria, etc.,\r\nAlgeria, Greece (April 23, May 7), Cyprus, Corfu (March), Malta (March\r\n30), Naples, Corsica (March 25), Valencia (October 9), Montenegro (April\r\n15, 24), Asia Minor (May 9, Sept. 21), Fao, Persian Gulf, Iraq (April,\r\nAug., Sept.).\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Formerly in Denmark from May 6 to June 8 (12 records),\r\noccasionally in July; in Scandinavia from end of May to middle of July\r\n(10 records, June 13 to July 15).\r\n\r\n\r\nLYMNOCRYPTES MINIMUS (Brünnich)\r\n\r\nJACK SNIPE\r\n\r\n_Contributed by Francis Charles Robert Jourdain_\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nSometime during the spring of 1919, probably in April, a specimen of\r\nthis snipe was taken by a native on St. Paul Island, Pribilof Islands,\r\nAlaska, and presented to G. Dallas Hanna. The bird is now in the\r\ncollection of the California Academy of Sciences, and constitutes the\r\nonly record for North America. It is, however, a widely distributed\r\nspecies, breeding not only in Arctic Europe, but also across the\r\ngreater part of northern Asia, and wintering south to north Africa and\r\nsouthern Asia.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Of the courtship actions in the strict sense of the words\r\nwe have practically no observations, as this species has rarely been\r\nkept in captivity and then singly and for short periods. The nuptial\r\nflight is, however, more conspicuous and was described in the oft-quoted\r\nletter of John Wolley, written from Muoniovara on November 27th, 1853,\r\nto W. C. Hewitson (1856), and published in the third edition of\r\n\"Coloured Illustrations of the Eggs of British Birds\" by that writer. To\r\nWolley belongs the credit of being the first to discover and bring to\r\nthe knowledge of naturalists the eggs of this species, for the eggs\r\npreviously ascribed to this species from localities much farther south\r\nwere not by any means satisfactorily authenticated. Wolley had been for\r\nsome time at his headquarters on the borders of Sweden and what is now\r\nFinland, when, on June 17th, 1853, while working the great marsh at\r\nMuonioniska, he first heard the jack snipe, though as he states:\r\n\r\n     At the time I could not at all guess what it was--an extraordinary\r\n     sound unlike anything I had heard before. I could not tell from\r\n     what direction it came, and it filled me with a curious suspense.\r\n     My Finnish interpreter thought it was a Capercally (_Tetrao\r\n     urogallus_) and at the time I could not contradict him; but soon I\r\n     found that it was a small bird gliding at a wild pace at a great\r\n     height over the marsh. I know not how better to describe the noise\r\n     than by likening it to the cantering of a horse in the distance\r\n     over a hard hollow road; it came in fours with a similar cadence\r\n     and a like clear, yet hollow, sound. The same day we found a nest\r\n     which seemed of a kind unknown to me. The next morning I went to\r\n     Kharto-uoma with a good strength of beaters. I kept them as well as\r\n     I could in line, myself in the middle, my Swedish traveling\r\n     companion on one side, and the Finn talker on the other. Whenever a\r\n     bird was put off its nest the man who saw it was to pass on the\r\n     word and the whole line was to stand whilst I went to examine the\r\n     eggs and take them at once or observe the bearings of the spot for\r\n     another visit as might be necessary. We had not been many hours in\r\n     the marsh when I saw a bird get up before Herr Saloman, and I\r\n     marked it down. In the meantime the nest was found and when I came\r\n     up the owner was declared to have appeared striped on the back and\r\n     not white over the tail. A sight of the eggs, as they lay\r\n     untouched, raised my expectations to the highest pitch. I went to\r\n     the spot where I had marked the bird, put it up again, found that\r\n     it was indeed a jack snipe, and again saw it after a short, low\r\n     flight drop suddenly into cover; once more it rose a few feet from\r\n     where it had settled, I fired and in a minute had in my hand a true\r\n     jack snipe, the undoubted parent of the nest of eggs. In the course\r\n     of the day and night I found three more nests and examined the\r\n     birds of each. One allowed me to touch it with my hand before it\r\n     rose, and another only got up when my foot was within 6 inches of\r\n     it. It was very fortunate that I was thus able satisfactorily to\r\n     identify so fine a series of eggs, for they differ considerably\r\n     from one another.\r\n\r\nThe great German ornithologist Naumann (1887) also describes the\r\nnuptial flight, as observed by him in still weather on spring\r\nevenings; as scarcely audible at over a hundred paces and recalling the\r\ntapping noise made by the death-watch beetle. He writes the sound as\r\n\"_Tettettettettett_,\" etc., and says each note lasts six seconds at a\r\ntime, as the bird sweeps over the marsh now rising and then falling in\r\ntone as it is uttered.\r\n\r\nV. Russon, the Estonian ornithologist, also observed the flight on a\r\nmarsh near Kurkull, in Estonia, and noticed that the snipe rose high in\r\nthe air and gradually descended again after a flight of several hundred\r\nyards. He compares the sound to the words: \"_Lok-toggi, lok-toggi,\r\nlok-toggi_,\" which certainly agree with the impression given by Wolley's\r\ngraphic description. He says the local names current in the district are\r\nderived from the resemblance the bird's notes bear to the rattle of a\r\ndilapidated wagon wheel. In the night the jack snipe is silent, but the\r\ndisplay begins again with the first glimmering of dawn, but does not as\r\na rule last long. The note described by Naumann he only heard on two\r\noccasions just before the bird settled in the swamp and believed it to\r\nbe caused by rapid snapping of the bill.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Like the common snipe, the jack snipe breeds in the marshes,\r\nchoosing a slight hollow in a fairly dry, grassy, or sedge-grown spot,\r\nbut close to open swamp. Wolley describes the five nests seen by him as\r\nbeing all alike in structure, \"made loosely of little pieces of grass\r\nand equisetum not at all woven together, with a few old leaves of the\r\ndwarf birch.\" It is an extremely close sitter, not stirring from its\r\neggs till almost trodden on, while one bird actually allowed Wolley to\r\ntouch it with his hand before it flew. The breeding season is late, for\r\neggs are rarely met with before mid-June and have been recorded\r\nthroughout July and even in August.\r\n\r\nRalph Chislett (1927) has published his recent experience with the\r\nnesting habits of the jack snipe, from which the following is quoted:\r\n\r\n     The wide marsh stretched for a number of miles between the\r\n     birch-clad slopes of some low hills. From the hillsides, at\r\n     intervals, open sheets of water of varying dimensions could be\r\n     seen, and a fringe of the birch forest stretched almost down to a\r\n     small, peaty pool. Through the woodland fringe a stream hurried,\r\n     clear and cold with melted snow from the hill. Leaving the stream\r\n     at a place where yellow globe-flowers grew in profusion, we\r\n     followed the ridges of soft ground which intersected the marsh.\r\n     Progress was impeded by scrub-willow, while hummocks of moss and\r\n     mounds of crowberry and vaccinium overlay the peat foundation of\r\n     the ridge, many of the hummocks being white with cloudberry blooms.\r\n     Between the ridges in the marshy tracts grass grew thinly through\r\n     the moss, and still more thinly in the centers, where our feet were\r\n     brought up firmly at a depth of eighteen inches by the still frozen\r\n     bottom. Later in the summer the marshes would probably be deeper.\r\n\r\n     Not more than two hundred yards from the wood, a ridge sank and\r\n     allowed the surplus water from one flattened area of grassy marsh\r\n     to drain through to the next. On the north side of the trickle the\r\n     ground rose slowly to the full height of the ridge again, perhaps a\r\n     yard above the marsh-level. Midway up the little slope, on a dry\r\n     bit of ground, a few stalks of scrub-birch partially shielded the\r\n     jack snipe from view as it sat on the nest by the side of a\r\n     cloudberry plant. Not that shelter was needed. The nest would never\r\n     have been found had my foot not happened to drop within a few\r\n     inches of it. Then away the bird flew, with a low, almost direct\r\n     flight, without any sudden twists for some twenty yards, then down\r\n     into the marsh. When flushed it disappeared from view into the\r\n     marsh and was not seen again until within a few feet of the nest.\r\n     Once, when spotted a couple of yards away, it covered that short\r\n     distance a foot at a time, crouching down for a few seconds between\r\n     each very short journey; then, still crouching, it covered the eggs\r\n     and remained motionless.\r\n\r\n     The nest was found on June 12th, 1926, and it then contained four\r\n     eggs. The last time I inspected it was on July 6th, when the eggs\r\n     were cracking at their larger ends.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The eggs are extraordinarily large for the size of the bird,\r\nbeing but little smaller than those of the common snipe (_Capella\r\ngallinago_). They are, as a rule, more or less distinctly pyriform and\r\nare normally four in number. The ordinary types vary in ground color\r\nfrom \"chamois\" to \"cream buff\" in the buff types and \"olive-lake\" or\r\n\"corn-olive\" to \"olive-buff\" in the green types. As a rule, the markings\r\nare somewhat smaller and more uniformly distributed than in common\r\nsnipes' eggs. They are in some shade of light or dark brown, such as\r\n\"tawny,\" \"russet-vinaceous,\" \"chocolate,\" \"liver,\" or \"chestnut brown\";\r\nthe underlying markings, which are numerous and conspicuous in some\r\ncases, are in various shades of \"purple drab\" or \"drab-grey.\" The spiral\r\nsmears, so frequently found in common snipes' eggs, seem to be absent\r\nfrom those of the jack snipe, and, though there are some cases of wide\r\nvariation in coloring, a series will be found to be browner and less\r\nbold in markings than a corresponding number of the common species. The\r\nmeasurements of 146 eggs average 38.53 by 27.37 millimeters; the eggs\r\nshowing the four extremes measure =44.5= by 28.5, 40 by =30=, =35= by 27\r\nand 38 by =25.5= millimeters. Rey (1905) states that the shells are\r\nsomewhat thinner and lighter than with the common snipe and gives the\r\naverage weight as 660 grams.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy plumage is described by Dresser (1871) as\r\nfollows, from a nestling obtained at Muonioniska:\r\n\r\n     Entire upper parts richly varied, deep rufous and black, dotted\r\n     here and there with white; a buffy white streak passes from the\r\n     forehead over the eye; below this is a dark-brown streak covering\r\n     the lores to the eye; from the base of the lower mandible another\r\n     white streak passes below the eye and one also from the chin (which\r\n     is buffy white) along the side of the head to the nape; underparts\r\n     dark-reddish brown, slightly varied with blackish brown; bill and\r\n     legs much developed.\r\n\r\nFor descriptions of subsequent plumages and molts the reader is referred\r\nto \"A Practical Handbook of British Birds,\" edited by H. F. Witherby\r\n(1920).\r\n\r\n_Food._--Probably consists mainly of worms, with a considerable mixture\r\nof insects and some vegetable matter (seeds, etc.). Naumann (1887)\r\nremarks that he has several times found grass seeds in stomachs and\r\nbelieves that vegetable matter is taken as well as insects and worms.\r\nNewstead records Coleoptera (3 cases), Mollusca (_Tellina_ and _Helix_,\r\n2 cases), vegetable matter (grass, etc.), sand, and pebbles. Cordeaux\r\nfound fragments of fresh-water shells and a few bivalves (_Pisidia_),\r\nwhile Saxby met with plant fibers and mud.\r\n\r\n_Behavior and voice._--The jack snipe is an extremely silent bird, and\r\nto a great extent, solitary, outside the breeding season. The noises\r\nmade during the nuptial flight have already been dealt with, but it is\r\ncharacteristic of the species that when flushed, unlike the common\r\nsnipe, it nearly always rises in silence. Naumann, however, writes that\r\non rare occasions, generally toward evening, a weak, high-pitched note\r\nmay be uttered, like \"_Kitz_\" or \"_Kutz_,\" which he compares to a bat's\r\nsqueak. One may, however, put up twenty birds one after another without\r\nhearing anything, though very rarely a single \"_ahtch_\" is uttered, much\r\nmore softly than the corresponding note of the common snipe. On being\r\nflushed it dashes off quickly with unsteady flight, but pitches again\r\nbefore rising to any height, and, except on migration or on its breeding\r\nground, usually flies low.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--Its solitary habits and small size are the best field\r\ncharacters, combined with the fact that it is not shy and usually rises\r\nat very short range, so that one gets a good view of it before it\r\npitches again at no great distance, where it can be flushed again. The\r\nalmost invariable absence of any note on rising is very characteristic.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--Scandinavian Lapland and Finland south to about\r\nlatitude 64°. In Germany it is said to have bred in various localities\r\nfrom Schleswig Holstein to East Prussia, but there is no doubt that most\r\nof these records, if not all, are not, and can never be, satisfactorily\r\nauthenticated. It does, however, breed in the Baltic Republics (Estonia\r\nand Latvia) and apparently in North Poland, while in Russia it breeds on\r\nthe tundra south to the Governments of Perm, Kazan, Vologda, Jaroslav,\r\nVladimir, Orel, Tula, and Tver. In Asia, though absent from the extreme\r\nnorth of Siberia, it is found in the Arctic Zone south to Tobolsk and\r\nnorth to the Boganida (lat. 70°), while eastward it ranges to the Kolyma\r\ndelta.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--While a few birds remain in favorable localities or\r\nmild weather at short distances south of their breeding quarters, the\r\nmain body migrates through Europe south to the countries bordering the\r\nMediterranean and its islands (Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta,\r\nSicily, Ionian Isles, Crete, Cyprus, etc.). In Africa it is met with in\r\nall the countries on the northern littoral from Morocco to Egypt; also\r\nup the Nile Valley to the Blue Nile (Lakes Nakuru and Naivasha), and\r\nsparingly to Kenya Colony. In Asia from West Palestine, South Iraq,\r\nPersia, Afghanistan, throughout India, Ceylon, Burma, China (scarce),\r\nFormosa, and Japan. In the Canaries it occurs only on passage in small\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--In south Spain, end of February and early March;\r\nCorsica, February (late date March 27); Greece, February (late dates\r\nMarch 2 and 19); Italy, April and early May (latest date beginning of\r\nJune); Cyprus, end of March and early April (late date April 16). In the\r\nBritish Isles the passage lasts from the end of March to the third week\r\nof May (late date June, North Uist); in Denmark, April; south Sweden\r\nfrom end of March to middle of April; in Hungary they leave about the\r\nend of March; and have been noted in Russia in the Caucasus, the Kirghis\r\nSteppes, and the Urals. In Asia they remain in Iraq to April 7; Sind,\r\nearly April. Arrival noted on the Boganida June 8. In Africa, Morocco\r\n(February), Tunisia (February, March), Abyssinia (February), and Egypt\r\n(March).\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--In the British Isles from mid September to end\r\nNovember (early dates, August 12, 1910, Norfolk; August 20, 1910, Essex;\r\nAugust 1, Norfolk). Heligoland (September and October); also met with in\r\npractically all European countries, reaching south Spain (November, end\r\nOctober, or early November). In Asia recorded from Asia Minor,\r\nTransjordania (October), arriving Sind (early October) and India\r\n(September-October).\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--Once recorded from the Faeroes (1910); also on\r\nMadeira (March 15, 1889); Andaman Isles (once), as well as on the\r\nPribilof Isles.\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--June 4 to 12 (2 records); 14 to 21 (8 records); 22 to 30\r\n(2 records); July 1 to 14 (3 records); 15 to 28 (4 records); 29 to\r\nAugust 2 (2 records).\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMNODROMUS GRISEUS GRISEUS (Gmelin)\r\n\r\nEASTERN DOWITCHER\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThe dowitcher, or, as I should prefer to see it called, the red-breasted\r\nsnipe, occurs as a species entirely across the American continent. The\r\nlong-billed dowitcher, the western form, was originally described as a\r\ndistinct, full species; it has since been reduced to the rank of a\r\nsubspecies, because of very evident intergradation; and now some very\r\ngood ornithologists are in doubt as to the propriety of recognizing the\r\ntwo varieties in nomenclature at all, because no distinctly different\r\nbreeding ranges for the two forms have been established, and typical\r\n(so-called) eastern birds have never been found breeding anywhere. What\r\nfew breeding birds have come from Alaska and northern Mackenzie all seem\r\nto be _scolopaceus_, but _griseus_ may still be found breeding there\r\nwhen we have larger series. I have had considerable correspondence with\r\nProf. William Rowan about the breeding dowitchers of Alberta, including\r\ninterchange of specimens. He seems to think that the Alberta birds are\r\nconstantly distinct from either _griseus_ or _scolopaceus_ and perhaps\r\nworthy of a name. It seems to me that they are strictly intermediate and\r\nshould not be named. In a letter recently received from P. A. Taverner\r\nhe seems inclined to recognize the Alberta bird as a \"short-billed bird\r\nresembling the eastern most, but intermediate, and with spotting\r\ncharacters different from either.\"\r\n\r\nOn migrations, and in winter, both forms are found entirely across the\r\ncontinent. The best that can be said is that _griseus_ is more common on\r\nthe Atlantic and _scolopaceus_ is more common on the Pacific coast. Dr.\r\nLouis B. Bishop, with whom I have discussed this question, is inclined\r\nto call one a mutant of the other; he has some 200 dowitchers in his\r\ncollection, from all parts of the country, those from the Atlantic and\r\nPacific coasts being about equally divided and the two forms being about\r\nequally represented. In analyzing his series, taking into account length\r\nof bill, length of wing and brightness of color, he finds that: of\r\n_griseus_, 86 per cent are from the Atlantic coast, 2 per cent from the\r\ninterior, and 12 per cent from the Pacific coast; and of _scolopaceus_,\r\n14 per cent are from the Atlantic coast, 30 per cent from the interior,\r\nand 56 per cent from the Pacific coast. While collecting near Pasadena,\r\nCalifornia, on April 25, 1923, he shot into a large flock of dowitchers\r\nand picked up nine birds, all but one of which were typical _griseus,_\r\nin bill, wing, and color.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The last of the dowitchers which winter in Florida, or\r\nmigrate through there, leave for the north during May, though a general\r\nnorthward movement has been going on during April. The earliest birds\r\nsometimes reach Massachusetts by May 1, but usually the main flight\r\ncomes along about May 20 and lasts for about ten days. Audubon (1840)\r\nobserved large numbers of this species flying eastward along the coasts\r\nof Louisiana and Texas during April. And Arthur T. Wayne (1910) says\r\nthat \"these birds migrate to their breeding grounds in the far north\r\nbetween May 1 and 15, and when the tide is low in the afternoon and a\r\nlight southerly wind prevails, flock after flock can be seen migrating\r\nin a northwesterly direction. I have yet to see these birds migrate\r\nalong the coast line in the spring.\" This would seem to indicate an\r\noverland route from South Carolina, in addition to the Atlantic coast\r\nroute referred to above. Professor Rowan writes to me that dowitchers\r\nare common on both migrations in Alberta, and says:\r\n\r\n     In a long series of spring and fall skins, there is every gradation\r\n     from the supposed typical eastern form (_griseus_) to the so-called\r\n     long-billed form (_scolopaceus_). Bill lengths and colors do not\r\n     correspond as they are supposed to do. As far as this district is\r\n     concerned, there is absolutely no evidence in support of the\r\n     splitting of this species into two races. The only two really\r\n     long-billed birds that have been taken, were deliberately collected\r\n     from a flock as their bills were so obviously longer than those of\r\n     their companions even in life. Intermediate lengths, forming a\r\n     nicely graded series, have been secured. The colors and markings of\r\n     the spring birds are infinite in variety, and do not correspond to\r\n     the bill lengths that should go with them.\r\n\r\nThere is a northward migration through the interior, in which this form\r\nis undoubtedly represented, but to what extent it is hard to tell, as it\r\nis impossible to separate all the records. Both forms are recorded on\r\nmigrations in California and British Columbia.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Richard C. Harlow has sent me some brief notes on the\r\ncourtship of this species, as seen on its breeding grounds in Alberta.\r\nThere were at least eight pairs of birds in the vicinity and they kept\r\nup their courtships until he left on June 9. The males apparently\r\noutnumber the females, for at least two females were seen surrounded by\r\nlittle groups of three or four males, frequently singing and displaying.\r\n\"The male frequently strutted like a woodcock and displayed, and several\r\ntimes arose and gave his flight song, a clear, liquid, musical,\r\ncontralto gurgle.\" Professor Rowan thinks that both sexes indulge in\r\nthis song.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The breeding range of the eastern dowitcher is imperfectly\r\nknown or not known at all, unless we include the birds which breed in\r\nAlberta under this form, where in my opinion they belong. Prof. Wells W.\r\nCooke (1912) writes:\r\n\r\n     The nest and eggs of the dowitcher are not yet known to science,\r\n     nor has the species been seen in summer at any place where it was\r\n     probably breeding. The dowitcher is a common migrant on the coasts\r\n     of New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, and in\r\n     fall is sometimes very abundant. Farther north its numbers\r\n     decrease: New Hampshire, tolerably common in fall, no spring\r\n     records; Maine, tolerably common spring and fall; Quebec, rare\r\n     migrant; New Brunswick, no records; Nova Scotia, once (Sharpe);\r\n     Prince Edward Island, once; Ungava, a few in August, 1860, at\r\n     Henley Harbor (Coues), one June 10, 1883, at Fort Chimo (Turner).\r\n     North of Ungava, the only record is that of a single accidental\r\n     occurrence at Fiskenaes, Greenland (Reinhardt). Evidently the\r\n     dowitcher does not breed in any numbers, on the eastern coast of\r\n     Ungava. The probability that it does not breed there at all is\r\n     strengthened by the fact that several first-class observers, who\r\n     during the fall migration were in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, did not\r\n     see any of the birds. It undoubtedly does not go into northeastern\r\n     Keewatin and the islands of the Province of Franklin, for it is not\r\n     reported by the various expeditions that have traveled and wintered\r\n     in those districts, while the specimens taken on the west coast of\r\n     Hudson Bay belong to the form called scolopaceus. The only district\r\n     left for the breeding ground is the interior of Ungava and the\r\n     eastern shore of Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\nW. E. Clyde Todd, who has probably done more field work than anyone else\r\non the east coast of Hudson Bay, writes to me:\r\n\r\n     Replying to your query about the dowitcher, it is my opinion that\r\n     this species does not breed in the interior of northern Ungava, but\r\n     I admit I have nothing to prove it one way or the other. It seems\r\n     to me, though, that if it did breed there, it would be far more\r\n     common than it is at the southern end of James Bay in migration,\r\n     instead of being one of the rarer kinds. I never saw it anywhere\r\n     north of this part, but then I have not been in northern Ungava in\r\n     the breeding season.\r\n\r\nTurner's record of a single bird at Fort Chimo, on June 10, 1883, seems\r\nto be the only peg on which to hang the Ungava theory; and this may have\r\nbeen a straggler. The Alberta birds are somewhat intermediate; and\r\nprobably typical _griseus_, if there is any such thing, will be found\r\nbreeding somewhere in the muskeg regions of central Canada between\r\nAlberta and Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\nThere are several sets of dowitcher's eggs in collections, from this\r\ngeneral region, collected in 1903 and 1906, which have been looked upon\r\nwith some suspicion; one came from Hayes River Flat, 25 miles north of\r\n55°, one from just south of Little Slave Lake, and three from Little Red\r\nDeer River, Alberta. Now that the dowitcher has been definitely shown to\r\nbreed in Alberta, these records look authentic.\r\n\r\nTo A. D. Henderson and his guests is due all the credit for recent\r\npositive evidence. On June 18, 1924, he found a pair of dowitchers with\r\ntwo young, only a day or two old, \"near a small lake in a muskeg about\r\n17 miles northeast of Fort Assiniboine.\" The following season he found\r\ndowitchers again at three different places in the same region, \"probably\r\na dozen pairs in all\"; and on June 2, about 35 miles northeast of Fort\r\nAssiniboine, he took his first set of three fresh eggs. The nest was \"in\r\na muskeg in open growth of small tamarac trees about 125 yards from a\r\nlake\"; he describes it as \"a hollow in a lump of moss, scantily lined\r\nwith a few tamarac twigs, leaves, and fine dry grass, at the root of a\r\nsmall dead alder about 12 inches high\"; it measured 1-3/4 inches deep\r\nand 4 inches across; the top was 4 inches above standing water.\r\n\r\nMr. Harlow, who was with Mr. Henderson the next year, 1926, took two\r\nsets of four eggs each. One \"nest was in an extensive tundralike muskeg,\r\nvery quaking and wet, and the nest was in a small bunch of dwarf birch,\r\nnot over 12 inches high, on the end of a little ridge of moss and\r\ncompletely surrounded on three sides by water.\" The male was seen\r\n\"singing\" near the nest. He joined the female after she had fluttered\r\noff the nest and the pair were seen feeding together; several times they\r\nstood erect and rubbed their bills together. After the eggs were taken\r\na set of phalarope's eggs was placed in the nest; the dowitcher returned\r\ntook one look at the eggs and then flew away and was never seen near the\r\nnest again.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--One of Mr. Henderson's sets was apparently complete with three\r\neggs, but four is the usual number. There is probably no constant\r\ndifference between the eggs of this and its long-billed relative. One of\r\nMr. Harlow's sets he describes as \"light olive-green, rather lightly\r\nmarked with pin points, spots, flecks, and a few blotches of dark umber\r\nand dark brown.\" The other set, he says, is slightly darker olive-green\r\nand is \"much more heavily spotted and blotched with small and large\r\nspots of umber and brown and under shell markings of a lighter color.\"\r\nThe measurements of 18 Alberta eggs average 40.8 by 29.2 millimeters;\r\nthe eggs showing the four extremes measure =44= by 29.5, 41 by =30.3=,\r\n=38.2= by 28.5, and 38.7 by =27.7= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The plumages and molts, which are the same in both forms,\r\nare fully described under the long-billed dowitcher.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The favorite feeding grounds of the dowitchers are the mud\r\nflats and sand flats in sheltered bays and estuaries, or the borders of\r\nshallow ponds on the marshes, where they associate freely with small\r\nplovers and sandpipers. Although not inclined to move about actively,\r\ntheir feeding motions are very rapid, as they probe in the mud or sand\r\nwith quick, perpendicular strokes of their long bills, driving them in\r\ntheir full length again and again in rapid succession; while feeding in\r\nshallow water the whole head is frequently immersed and sometimes\r\nseveral strokes are made with the head under water. Dr. E. R. P. Janvrin\r\nwrites to me:\r\n\r\n     Mr. J. T. Nichols and I watched three individuals feeding on the\r\n     salt meadows late in the afternoon, continuing our observations\r\n     until it was so dark that we could hardly distinguish the birds any\r\n     longer; at which time the birds were still feeding. The question\r\n     arose whether dowitchers might not be nocturnal in their feeding\r\n     habits, as is the case with the woodcock and Wilson's snipe, since\r\n     the sense of sight is certainly not essential to their probing for\r\n     food.\r\n\r\nVarious observers have noted among the food items of the dowitcher\r\ngrasshoppers, beetles, flies, maggots, marine worms, oyster worms,\r\nleeches, water bugs, fish eggs, small mollusks, seeds of aquatic plants,\r\nand the roots of eelgrass.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Dowitchers are the gentlest and most unsuspicious of shore\r\nbirds, which has made them easy prey for the avaricious gunner. Their\r\nflight is swift and steady, often protracted and sometimes at a great\r\nelevation, when looking for feeding places. They usually fly in compact\r\nflocks by themselves, sometimes performing interesting evolutions high\r\nin the air. They often fly, however, in flocks with other small waders,\r\nbut the dowitchers are generally bunched together in the flock; I once\r\nshot four dowitchers out of a mixed flock without hitting any of the\r\nsmaller birds. When a flock of dowitchers alights the birds are closely\r\nbunched, but they soon scatter out and begin to feed. If a flock is shot\r\ninto, the sympathetic and confiding birds return again and again to\r\ntheir fallen companions until only a pitiful remnant is left to finally\r\nescape. Such slaughter of the innocents well-nigh exterminated this\r\ngentle species; but, now that it is protected, it is beginning to\r\nincrease again.\r\n\r\nAlthough all shore birds can swim, the dowitcher seems to be especially\r\nadept at it. Doctor Coues (1874) writes:\r\n\r\n     Being partly web-footed, this snipe swims tolerably well for a\r\n     little distance in an emergency, as when it may get for a moment\r\n     beyond its depth in wading about, or when it may fall,\r\n     broken-winged, on the water. On such an occasion as this last, I\r\n     have seen one swim bravely for 20 or 30 yards, with a curious\r\n     bobbing motion of the head and corresponding jerking of the tail,\r\n     to a hiding place in the rank grass across the pool. When thus\r\n     hidden they keep perfectly still, and may be picked up without\r\n     resistance, except a weak flutter, and perhaps a low, pleading cry\r\n     for pity on their pain and helplessness. When feeding at their\r\n     ease, in consciousness of peace and security, few birds are of more\r\n     pleasing appearance. Their movements are graceful and their\r\n     attitudes often beautifully statuesque.\r\n\r\nW. E. D. Scott (1881) says:\r\n\r\n     A curious habit of this species was noted at the mouth of the\r\n     Withlacoochee, where I saw the birds alight in very deep water and\r\n     swim about for considerable time. This occurred in every instance\r\n     after a flock had been fired at, and I thought at first that the\r\n     birds had been wounded, but after observing the occurrence a number\r\n     of times and on watching the birds while in the water I concluded\r\n     that such was not the case. Those I noted were generally solitary\r\n     individuals, but twice I saw three, and once four, alight in the\r\n     water, swim lightly and gracefully about, and, when disturbed, rise\r\n     easily and fly away.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--John T. Nichols has sent me the following notes on the\r\ncharacteristic calls of this species.\r\n\r\n     The flight note of the dowitcher resembles that of the lesser\r\n     yellow-legs but is recognizably different, less loud and more\r\n     hurried, usually suggesting the bird's name: _dowitch_, or\r\n     _dowitcher_, sometimes of a single syllable. This call is subject\r\n     to considerable variation. When used as a regular flight or\r\n     recognition note I believe it is most frequently two-syllabled,\r\n     clear and full. When the call becomes more abrupt and emphatic and\r\n     the last syllable is multiplied it seems to indicate that the bird\r\n     is excited rather than to have other especial significance; thus,\r\n     _dowicheche_.\r\n\r\n     This note appears to be identical in the eastern dowitcher and the\r\n     long-billed race which I have studied in Florida. Other minor calls\r\n     of the dowitcher are single, unloud, low-pitched _chups_ with which\r\n     a flock manoeuvred about decoys (Long Island, August) resembling an\r\n     analogous yellowleg note; a low rattle when dropping down to alight\r\n     (Long Island, May); a mellow, ploverlike _cluee_, suggesting a call\r\n     of single lesser yellow-legs when loath to leave a feeding ground,\r\n     calling to other more restless individuals of their kind. This was\r\n     heard from a single dowitcher on the ground when a flock of lesser\r\n     yellow-legs was flushed a little way off. When these departed it\r\n     took wing with more usual dowitcher calls and followed after (Long\r\n     Island, July). I have on record also a startled _chee_ from an\r\n     extra tame long-billed dowitcher in Florida, flushed by being\r\n     almost struck by something thrown at it.\r\n\r\nWhile observing the shore bird migration on the coast of New Jersey,\r\nduring the last week of May, with Dr. Harry C. Oberholser, we frequently\r\nheard the pretty and vivacious flight song of the dowitcher. It was a\r\nsibilant, whistling song, rather loud and with a staccato effect. Doctor\r\nOberholser, whose ears are better than mine now are, wrote down his\r\nimpressions of it for me. Three short notes were heard separately,\r\n_tíliloo_, _tídilee_ and _tíchilee_, accented on the first syllable; the\r\nlast two were commonest. The complete song sounded like\r\n_tídilee-tí-tscha-tscha-tscha_ or _tíchilee-tí-tsocha-tscha-tscha_, with\r\nnumerous variations and combinations of the above notes, a very striking\r\nsong. This is somewhat similar in form to the song of the long-billed\r\ndowitcher heard on its breeding grounds and described by Dr. E. W.\r\nNelson (1887); it is probably a courtship song.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The dowitcher when standing is a fat, chunky bird, with\r\nshort greenish legs and a very long bill, with which it probes\r\nperpendicularly. In flight it also appears stout and usually carries its\r\nlong bill pointed slightly downward; in adult plumage it appears very\r\ndark colored. It has none of the slender appearance of the yellow-legs\r\nand its flight is steadier. When seen flying away from the observer the\r\ngrayish white central band on its back is conspicuous, as are the black\r\nand white, barred tail feathers.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--The dowitcher is one of the earliest of the fall migrants;\r\nprobably the first arrivals are birds that, for one reason or another,\r\nhave failed to raise broods of young, for the time elapsing between the\r\nlate-spring migration and the early-fall flight is not sufficient for\r\nsuccessful breeding. The first adults arrive on Cape Cod early in July;\r\nmy earliest date is July 4. Adults are common all through July, and I\r\nhave seen them as late as August 16. The young birds come along later,\r\nfrom August 8 to September 25. While with us they frequent the mud flats\r\nand edges of muddy ponds or bays in the marshes; they are seldom seen on\r\nthe sandy beaches or far out on the sand flats. They associate freely\r\nwith the smaller sandpipers, least, and semipalmated, or with the\r\nsemipalmated plover and turnstones. Often in the great flocks of these\r\nsmall sandpipers a number of dowitchers may be easily recognized by\r\ntheir much larger size and very dark appearance, also by their much\r\nlonger bills. They are then often concentrated in compact groups or\r\nstrung out in a long line, close to the edge of the water, probing in\r\nthe soft mud with quick strokes of their long bills. They are easily\r\napproached at such times, as they are almost as tame and unsuspicious\r\nas the little peep. When the flats are covered at high tide these birds\r\nresort to the salt marshes or meadows, where they rest and sleep; in\r\nsuch places they often lie very close and flush singly, much after the\r\nmanner of Wilson snipe.\r\n\r\n_Game._--Dowitchers, or \"brown backs,\" as they are called on Cape Cod,\r\nhave been popular game birds, and immense numbers have been shot in past\r\nyears. Audubon (1840) says that \"it is not at all uncommon to shoot 20\r\nor 30 of them at once. I have been present when 127 were killed by\r\ndischarging three barrels, and have heard of many dozens having been\r\nprocured at a shot.\" Edward Sturtevant says that a market hunter near\r\nNewport, Rhode Island, shot 1,058 dowitchers during the years from 1867\r\nto 1874. Their popularity and their tameness nearly caused the\r\nextermination of the species. Mr. John C. Cahoon (1888) wrote then:\r\n\r\n     They have decreased very fast during the last five years, and where\r\n     we saw a flock of several dozens then we now see them singly or in\r\n     bunches not exceeding 10 or 12. They are the least shy of any of\r\n     the shore birds, and it is due to this fact that they have\r\n     decreased so fast. They are easily decoyed, and although they fly\r\n     swiftly their motion is steady and they keep closely together. They\r\n     alight in a compact bunch, and the gunner usually shoots into them\r\n     before they scatter out. Many are killed by a single discharge, and\r\n     those that remain spring up with a sharp whistle and fly a short\r\n     distance away, when hearing what they think to be the call of a\r\n     deserted comrade they wheel about and come skimming bravely back to\r\n     the murderous spot where they were first shot at. Again they are\r\n     shot at, and again the remaining half dozen are loath to leave\r\n     their dead and dying companions, and return to share their fate.\r\n     One or two may escape, and as they drop silently down on some\r\n     lonely sand spit, sad relics of their departed companions, what\r\n     sorrowful thoughts must be theirs as they wait for their comrades\r\n     that will never come.\r\n\r\nSince that time the species has been saved by removing it from the\r\ngame-bird list, and it has increased considerably until now it is again\r\na fairly common bird. When flying in flocks it is too easily killed to\r\noffer the sportsman much of a thrill, but when flushed singly on the\r\nmeadows it has more of a sporting chance for its life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Chiefly eastern North America, islands of the Caribbean Sea\r\nand central South America; casual in Greenland, Alaska, the British\r\nIsles, and France.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The dowitchers which have been found breeding in\r\nAlberta, from Little Red Deer River to Fort Assiniboine, are\r\nintermediate between _griseus_ and _scolopaceus_, but nearer the former.\r\nEggs have also been taken at Hayes River Flat and just south of Little\r\nSlave Lake, which are probably of this form. The breeding range of\r\ntypical _griseus_ probably lies between these points and the west side\r\nof Hudson Bay and perhaps extends north to the Arctic coast.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--North to Louisiana (State game preserve, and Marsh\r\nIsland) and probably rarely to North Carolina (Fort Macon). East to\r\nrarely North Carolina (Fort Macon); South Carolina (near Charleston, and\r\nFrogmore); Georgia (Savannah and Blackbeard Island); Florida (Amelia\r\nIsland, Orange Hammock, and Bassenger); Bahama Islands (Great Inagua);\r\nJamaica; Lesser Antilles (Guadeloupe, Barbadoes and Grenada); Trinidad;\r\nand Brazil (Para and Bahia).

It was first described\r\nand long regarded as a distinct species, but later developments have\r\nshown intergradation and it has been reduced to sub-specific rank. The\r\nabove characters seem to hold good in all specimens collected on their\r\nbreeding grounds in Alaska and northwestern Mackenzie; and these\r\ncharacters are distinctive and well marked. But in immature and winter\r\nplumages the form can be recognized only by size; and, as the\r\nmeasurements of the two forms overlap and intergrade, only the extremes\r\ncan be positively named. The matter is further complicated by the fact\r\nthat the migration and winter ranges of the two forms overlap. This\r\nform, _scolopaceus_, is by no means rare on the Atlantic coast, and\r\n_griseus_ occurs regularly on the Pacific coast; intermediates are most\r\nabundant in the central valleys, but occur on both coasts.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The long-billed dowitcher is a rather early spring migrant;\r\nthe migration starts in March; the main flight through the United States\r\nis in April; and it reaches its northern breeding grounds in May. Dr. E.\r\nW. Nelson (1887) says of its arrival in northern Alaska:\r\n\r\n     In spring, the middle of May, as the snow disappears, and the first\r\n     pale leaves of grass begin to thrust their spear-points through the\r\n     dead vegetable mat on the ground, or as early as the 10th on some\r\n     seasons, this peculiar snipe returns to its summer home. At the\r\n     Yukon mouth I found them on May 12, when they were already engaged\r\n     in love-making, though the ground was still, to a great extent,\r\n     covered with snow, and only here and there appeared a thawed place\r\n     where they could feed. Toward the end of this month they are\r\n     plentiful, and their curious habits and loud notes make them among\r\n     the most conspicuous denizens of the marshes.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Doctor Nelson (1887) writes:\r\n\r\n     These are very demonstrative birds in their love-making, and the\r\n     last of May and first of June their loud cries are heard everywhere\r\n     about their haunts, especially in morning and evening. Two or three\r\n     males start in pursuit of a female and away they go twisting and\r\n     turning, here and there, over marsh and stream, with marvelous\r\n     swiftness and dexterity. At short intervals a male checks his\r\n     flight for a moment to utter a strident _pe-et u weet_; _wee-too,\r\n     wee-too_; then on he goes full tilt again. After they have mated,\r\n     or when a solitary male pays his devotions, they rise 15 or 20\r\n     yards from the ground, where, hovering upon quivering wings, the\r\n     bird pours forth a lisping but energetic and frequently musical\r\n     song, which can be very imperfectly expressed by the syllables\r\n     _peet-peet_; _pee-ter-wee-too_; _wee-too_; _pee-ter-wee-too_;\r\n     _pee-ter-wee-too_; _wee-too_; _wee-too_. This is the complete song\r\n     but frequently only fragments are sung, as when the bird is in\r\n     pursuit of the female.\r\n\r\nHerbert W. Brandt says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     The male long-billed dowitcher pours forth his wild musical song as\r\n     he hovers in the air with raised vibrating wings, perhaps 50 feet\r\n     above the object of his rapturous outburst. The female, from her\r\n     retreat on the cozy border of a lowland pool, modestly watches the\r\n     ardent lover as he renders his melodious homage. In common with\r\n     many others of the shore dwellers, the most conspicuous courting\r\n     action is the pursuit race by a number of males for their desired,\r\n     but elusive, lady love. It is then that one marvels at the speed\r\n     and agility displayed by apparently awkward birds, as they twist\r\n     and dodge in their aerial wooing. Even during his swift flight the\r\n     suitor tries, but with poor success, to continue his musical\r\n     efforts for the benefit of his larger paramour.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--MacFarlane's notes record brief descriptions of some half a\r\ndozen nests found in the Anderson River region and on the borders of the\r\nwooded country. These were all located on marshy ground near a swamp or\r\nsmall lake. One is described as \"a mere depression in the midst of a\r\ntuft or decayed grass, lined with a few withered leaves.\" A set\r\ncollected for me by F. S. Hersey, near St. Michael, Alaska, June 9,\r\n1914, was taken from a hollow in the moss between two clumps of grass on\r\nthe tundra; the female was flushed and shot. Mr. Brandt says in his\r\nnotes:\r\n\r\n     The nest of the long-billed dowitcher is a mere depression\r\n     scratched out on a small eminence on a wet moss-covered meadow\r\n     through which short sedges grow sparingly to a height of about six\r\n     inches. The nest, the bottom of which was usually wet, was in every\r\n     case surrounded by shallow fresh water and the basinlike cavity was\r\n     meagerly lined with grass and small leaves. In two nests the eggs\r\n     rested on the cold wet moss foundation still frozen a few inches\r\n     underneath and the scanty nesting material was all deposited on the\r\n     rim of the nest. In every instance the female was conducting the\r\n     incubation, but the male was in close attendance. The bird is a\r\n     very close sitter and must be almost trodden upon before it will\r\n     rise, wings spread, from its duties.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Four eggs seems to be the invariable rule for the long-billed\r\ndowitcher. In shape they vary from ovate pyriform to subpyriform; some\r\nare quite rounded and others are decidedly pointed. They have only a\r\nslight gloss. Mr. Brandt in his notes describes his four sets, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     The ground color has considerable variation and shows two distinct\r\n     types: The commoner one, the brown type, of which we found three\r\n     sets is \"Saccardo's olive\"; and the other type, represented by a\r\n     single set, is \"greenish,\" shading to \"bluish glaucous.\" The\r\n     markings are bold, slightly elongated and seldom confluent, so that\r\n     blotched markings are unusual. The eggs are medium to heavily\r\n     spotted, causing the ground color to be conspicuous, and, in\r\n     consequence, the underlying markings are very noticeable. The\r\n     primary spots are in various shades of brown, namely: \"Vandyke\r\n     brown,\" \"seal brown,\" and \"Saccardo's umber,\" which make the egg\r\n     one of unusual beauty. The underlying spots are \"drab gray\" to\r\n     \"light grayish olive\" and are larger and more numerous than are\r\n     found on the other limicoline eggs we collected at Hooper Bay.\r\n\r\nIn my set the ground colors vary from \"dark olive buff\" to \"olive buff.\"\r\nTwo of the eggs are irregularly spotted and blotched with spots of\r\nvarious sizes; one is quite evenly marked with small elongated spots;\r\nand another is sparingly spotted and blotched, chiefly about the larger\r\nend. The colors of the markings are \"Saccardo's umber,\" \"bister\" and\r\n\"warm sepia,\" with underlying markings of \"deep\" to \"pale brownish\r\ndrab.\" In other collections I have seen a number of sets that matched\r\nalmost exactly certain types of heavily blotched eggs of the Wilson\r\nsnipe; these may be within the normal range of dowitcher's eggs; but I\r\nhave always been suspicious that some of them were wrongly identified.\r\nThe measurements of 79 eggs average 41.8 by 28.9 millimeters; the eggs\r\nshowing the four extremes measures =45.5= by 30.5, 44 by =32=, =37.5= by\r\n29.2 and 39.4 by =26.3= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--H. B. Conover has sent me the following interesting notes:\r\n\r\n     Newly hatched young were found June 22nd. The incubation period\r\n     seems to be about 20 days. A nest found by Murie on May 31 with two\r\n     eggs, had four eggs on June 2, and on being visited the evening of\r\n     June 22, was found to contain two young and two pipped eggs. The\r\n     colors of the soft parts of a downy young several days old were as\r\n     follows: Tarsus olive with blackish stripes down the sides, bill\r\n     black, iris brown. In the newly hatched young the tarsus is much\r\n     lighter. On June 23 while visiting the nest of a black-bellied\r\n     plover, I came across a pair of dowitchers that from their actions\r\n     appeared to have young. Not wishing to stop at the time, I passed\r\n     on, but on returning several hours later, found them again in a\r\n     marsh at the foot of a long, low hill. When I sat down to watch,\r\n     one bird wheeled about me calling, and then flew off down the\r\n     valley. The other bird at first I could not locate, but soon saw it\r\n     flying about the hillside chirping. I noticed that as this bird\r\n     passed over a certain spot, it would hover about 15 feet above the\r\n     ground, giving a whistling trill. After a few minutes it dawned on\r\n     me, that each time it hovered to give this call, it was a little\r\n     farther up the hillside. When I moved up toward the top of the\r\n     hill, the bird alighted close by, scolded for a while and then\r\n     commenced the same performance as before. In this way in about half\r\n     an hour the dowitcher and I had crossed the hill from one marsh to\r\n     another, a distance of about 600 yards. During all this time its\r\n     mate had appeared only twice, when it flew by calling and then\r\n     disappeared again. Finally the bird I was following alighted in the\r\n     marsh at the far side of the hill from where we had started, and\r\n     began running short distances, stopping and then running on again.\r\n     Watching through some field glasses, I soon saw a young one\r\n     following at its heels. Rushing down suddenly, three downies were\r\n     found hiding with their heads stuck into holes or depressions in\r\n     the moss. They appeared to be several days old. Evidently the old\r\n     dowitcher had led these young ones across the hill by simply\r\n     hovering over or in front of them and calling. The bird was\r\n     collected and proved to be a male. Just what the relation of the\r\n     male and female to the eggs and young is in this species it is hard\r\n     to say. From the experience above I believe the male does\r\n     nine-tenths of the work in caring for the chicks. I think this will\r\n     probably prove true as to the incubation of the eggs as well, but\r\n     that the female takes some share in the hatching seems probable, as\r\n     one collected in the vicinity of a nest showed incubation patches.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy young dowitcher somewhat resembles the young\r\nsnipe, but has a somewhat different pattern of similar colors. The large\r\ncentral crown patch is black, clouded, or overcast, with \"chestnut\" tips\r\nand with two indefinite spots of whitish tips; the black extends down to\r\nthe bill; a broad, black loral stripe extends from the eye to the bill,\r\nand a still broader postocular stripe from the eye to the nape; these\r\ntwo stripes are separated from the dark crown patch by a stripe which is\r\n\"tawny\" above the lores, buffy white over the eyes, and white around the\r\nposterior half of the crown. The chin is buffy white, and the throat\r\nand breast are \"ochraceous tawny,\" becoming lighter and grayer on the\r\nbelly. The upper parts are much like those of the snipe, variegated, or\r\nmarbled, with black, \"chestnut,\" and \"umber brown,\" and spotted with\r\nsmall round white spots, terminal tufts, which are very thick on the\r\nwings and form roughly two rows down the back and two rows on each\r\nthigh.\r\n\r\nIn fresh juvenal plumage in July in Alaska, the crown, back, and\r\nscapulars are black, broadly edged with \"cinnamon rufous\" or \"hazel\";\r\nthe throat, breast, and flanks are gray, the feathers broadly tipped\r\nwith \"ochraceous tawny\" and streaked with black or spotted with dusky;\r\nthe tertials, innermost greater coverts, and the median coverts are\r\nedged with \"cinnamon buff.\" These edgings are much browner in\r\n_scolopaceus_ and paler buff in _griseus_.\r\n\r\nA postjuvenal molt, beginning in September and lasting until December or\r\nlater, involves a change of the body plumage, sometimes the tail and\r\nsome of the wing coverts and scapulars. This produces the first winter\r\nplumage, which is like the adult winter plumage, except for the retained\r\njuvenal scapulars, tertials, and wing coverts. The first prenuptial molt\r\nis limited to a few scattering feathers in the body plumage, above and\r\nbelow, some of the scapulars and wing coverts, and the tail; these are\r\nlike corresponding spring feathers of the adult. There is considerable\r\nindividual variation in the amount of new feathers in this first nuptial\r\nplumage. I have seen birds in this plumage from March 28 to September 9.\r\nThey do not go north to breed, but remain in the South during the\r\nsummer. At the first postnuptial molt, in August, they assume the adult\r\nwinter plumage. In some young birds the prenuptial molt seems to be\r\nomitted and the postnuptial molt seems to be a change from one winter\r\nplumage to another.\r\n\r\nAdults have a partial prenuptial molt from February to May, involving\r\nall the body plumage, most of the scapulars, some of the tertials, the\r\ncentral pair of rectrices and the wing coverts. I have seen adults in\r\nfull nuptial plumage as early as March 4 and as late as August 21. July\r\nand August birds are very black above, due to the wearing away of the\r\nbuff edgings. There is much individual variation in the extent and\r\nintensity of the rufous and in the amount of black spotting on the\r\nbreast. The complete postnuptial molt of adults begins in August and is\r\noften finished in September. I have seen several birds in which the\r\nprimaries were being completely renewed during both months.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Preble and McAtee (1923) give the following report on the\r\ncontents of two stomachs of long-billed dowitchers:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Two stomachs, of the two specimens last mentioned from St. Paul\r\n     Island, have been examined and their contents were almost\r\n     exclusively the larvae of midges (Chironomidae), of which there\r\n     were more than 75 in one gizzard and more than 100 in the other.\r\n     Vegetable débris, amounting to 3 per cent by bulk of the stomach\r\n     contents, also was present, and it probably was picked up\r\n     incidentally with the midge larvae. Included in the vegetable\r\n     matter were seeds of bottle brush (_Hippuris vulgaris_), sedge\r\n     (_Carex_ sp.), and water chick-weed (_Montia fontana_).\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--I have never been able to discover any differences in\r\nbehavior between the two forms of the dowitcher; their habits are\r\ndoubtless similar. Some gunners think that they can distinguish the two\r\nforms by their notes, but the differences in notes are probably due to\r\nindividual variations in a somewhat varied vocabulary. John T. Nichols\r\n(1920) one of the closest students and best authorities on shore birds'\r\nnotes, says \"the chances are there is no significant difference in the\r\ncalls of the two races.\"\r\n\r\n_Fall._--S. F. Rathbun has sent me the following notes on the habits of\r\nthis bird on its migrations through the State of Washington:\r\n\r\n     The long-billed dowitcher will be found in the company of almost\r\n     any of the shore birds, in flocks of varying numbers, and even as\r\n     single individuals, but appears to show somewhat of a partiality\r\n     for the company of the black-bellied plover and the red-backed\r\n     sandpiper. On this coast both its spring and autumnal migrations\r\n     seem to be somewhat prolonged, for in the case of the former we\r\n     have records from April 11 until late in May; and for the latter\r\n     from early August until into November. It will be found alike on\r\n     the sandy beaches and the muddy flats, seemingly showing no\r\n     particular preference for either. When the tide is at its ebb on\r\n     the flats the birds oftimes become widely scattered and single ones\r\n     may be found in unexpected places. On one occasion as we were\r\n     walking across a grassy marsh the head and neck of a long-billed\r\n     dowitcher was seen exposed above the growth along the edge of one\r\n     of the little channels running through the marsh. As we approached\r\n     the bird it could be seen making attempts to rise, but this it was\r\n     unable to do on account of being impeded by the length of the\r\n     grass, and we drove the bird ahead until an open spot was reached\r\n     when it then took wing, at this time being but a few feet away.\r\n\r\n     On various occasions while we were watching flocks of the small\r\n     sandpipers about some bit of water, dowitchers would fly past and,\r\n     being attracted by the calls of other birds, they then after\r\n     circling for a moment or two would alight at the pool to feed.\r\n     When thus engaged they give the impression of being somewhat\r\n     deliberate in their actions and as they moved about some would\r\n     frequently wade up to their breasts into the shallow water, often\r\n     so remaining until by some action they seemed to lose a footing\r\n     and when this occurred a retreat would be made into a more shallow\r\n     part. Oftentimes one or more birds would suddenly cease feeding\r\n     and assume a posture of repose and when this took place it was a\r\n     common occurrence to see some standing on but one leg, thus to\r\n     remain motionless for a time.\r\n\r\n     Dowitchers do not appear to be very shy when found in the flocks\r\n     of the smaller sandpipers, but are the first birds to retreat as\r\n     one approaches the flock; and on such occasions it is generally\r\n     the case that one or more of them will suddenly take wing and put\r\n     the entire flock in motion. They are swift-flying birds and when\r\n     on the wing have a somewhat harsh note that is given from time to\r\n     time. In their spring dress they are attractive, as at this time\r\n     their under parts are a rich buff color, and a flock of dowitchers\r\n     seen at this season with the light striking full on their breasts\r\n     is indeed a handsome sight.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Dowitchers occur in winter as far south as Ecuador and Peru.\r\nDr. Frank M. Chapman (1926) referred the birds collected in Ecuador to\r\n_scolopaceus_. Nonbreeding birds, or immatures, remain there all summer,\r\nas they do in other parts of their winter range. I have taken both forms\r\nof dowitchers in Florida, where they winter regularly in small numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North America, Central America, Cuba, and northwestern South\r\nAmerica. Casual in Japan.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--North to probably eastern Siberia (Cape Wankarem);\r\nAlaska (Kuparuk River and Point Barrow); probably Yukon (Herschel\r\nIsland); and Mackenzie (Franklin Bay). East to Mackenzie (Franklin Bay).\r\nSouth to Mackenzie (Fort Anderson); Yukon (Lapierre House); and Alaska\r\n(Point Dall). West to Alaska (Point Dall, Pastolik, St. Michael, and\r\nKowak River); and probably eastern Siberia (Cape Wankarem).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--North to California (Los Banos and Santa Ana); Texas\r\n(Corpus Christi); Louisiana (State Game Preserve); Florida (East Goose\r\nCreek, Kissimmee, and Cape Canaveral); and probably Cuba (Santiago de\r\nVegas and San Fernando).

West to Guatemala; Tehuantepec (San Mateo); Jalisco (La\r\nBarca); Lower California (La Paz, San Jose Mission and San Quentin); and\r\nCalifornia (San Diego and Los Banos).\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--Early dates of spring arrival are: South Carolina,\r\nnear Charleston, April 30; New York, Long Island, March 20; Illinois,\r\nCary's Station, April 24, and Chicago, April 28; Minnesota, Heron Lake,\r\nMay 1; Kansas, Manhattan, April 21, and Wichita, April 28; Nebraska,\r\nCallaway, April 8, and Omaha, April 28; Iowa, Wall Lake, May 9; South\r\nDakota, Brown County, April 14, and Harrison, April 15; North Dakota,\r\nMenoken, May 7; Manitoba, Shoal Lake, April 24, Pilot Mound, May 1, and\r\nMargaret, May 18; Colorado, Loveland, April 6, Denver, April 26, and\r\nDurango, April 30; Wyoming, Cheyenne, May 2, and Lake Como, May 5;\r\ncentral and northern California, Alameda, March 15, Palo Alto, April 17,\r\nBallona, April 19, and Stockton, April 20; Oregon, Malheur Lake, April\r\n20; Washington, Menlo, May 1, and Fort Steilacoom, May 5; British\r\nColumbia, Courtenay, April 28, and Chilliwack, May 8; and Alaska, Craig,\r\nMay 2, Kuiu Island, May 3, Fort Kenai, May 4, and St. Michael, May 20.\r\n\r\nLate dates of spring departure are: Louisiana, New Orleans, March 20;\r\nTexas, Corpus Christi, April 20; Chihuahua, Lake Palomas, April 9;\r\nLower California, Gardner's Lagoon, April 19; and southern California,\r\nSanta Barbara, May 2.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--Early dates of fall arrival are: British Columbia,\r\nCourtenay, July 7, and Okanagan Landing, July 19; California, Balboa\r\nBay, July 6, Santa Barbara, July 18, and Fresno, August 6; Lower\r\nCalifornia, San Quentin, August 10, and San Jose del Cabo, August 28;\r\nTehuantepec, San Mateo, August 12; Montana, Billings, July 31; Utah,\r\nProvo River, July 24; Saskatchewan, Hay Creek, July 3; Colorado, Barr,\r\nJuly 5, and Denver, July 24; North Dakota, Devil's Lake, July 20, and\r\nMouse River, August 10; Texas, Brownsville, July 11; New York, Long\r\nIsland, July 16; North Carolina, Pea and Brodie Islands, July 7; and\r\nSouth Carolina, near Charleston, July 20.\r\n\r\nLate dates of fall departure are: British Columbia, Chilliwack, October\r\n29; Washington, Seattle, October 9, and Point Chehalis, October 19;\r\nnorthern and central California, Easton, October 18, Alameda, October\r\n29, and Stockton, November 5; Wyoming, Hutton's Lakes, October 14;\r\nColorado, Denver, October 3; Manitoba, Margaret, October 10; South\r\nDakota, Harrison, November 2; Nebraska, Valentine, October 28; Kansas,\r\nLawrence, October 3; Minnesota, St. Vincent, October 9; Missouri, St.\r\nLouis, October 28; New York, Long Island, November 2; and South\r\nCarolina, September 10.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--Occurrences of the long-billed dowitcher outside of\r\nits normal range must, of necessity be based upon the evidence of\r\nspecimens, as it is frequently confused with the more common dowitcher\r\nof the Atlantic coast, from Maine to Florida. Seven were collected in\r\nthe District of Columbia in April, 1884; one at North Haven,\r\nConnecticut, August 5, 1886; Hamilton, Ontario, August 21, 1891;\r\nLeighton, Alabama, May 15, 1891; Dauphin Island, Alabama (2), July 5,\r\n1913; Detroit, Michigan, August 26, 1905; Yokohama, Japan, March 13; and\r\nYezo, Japan, October 13.\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Arctic Canada: 18 records, June 6 to July 5; 9 records,\r\nJune 21 to July 3. Alaska: 17 records, May 29 to July 1; 9 records, June\r\n3 to 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICROPALAMA HIMANTOPUS (Bonaparte)\r\n\r\nSTILT SANDPIPER\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nStrangely enough I have never seen, or rather recognized, a stilt\r\nsandpiper in life. As it is often associated with the lesser yellow-legs\r\nand so easily mistaken for it, I may have overlooked it. It is a rare\r\nbird in the localities where most of my work on shorebirds has been done\r\nand it does not seem to be very common anywhere. It is more common on\r\nmigrations in the Mississippi Valley than elsewhere, on its way to and\r\nfrom its restricted breeding range on the barren grounds and Arctic\r\ncoast of Canada.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The spring migration is almost directly north from the Gulf\r\nof Mexico to Great Slave Lake and then down the Mackenzie Valley and\r\nother valleys to the Arctic coast. It is rare in spring on the Atlantic\r\ncoast. R. J. Longstreet writes to me that he saw three on May 4 and 5,\r\nand four on May 8, 1925, in Volusia County, Florida. C. G. Harrold tells\r\nme that it is a common spring migrant in Manitoba, \"even abundant at\r\ntimes, a flock of nearly 300 being seen in May, 1924, at Whitewater\r\nLake.\" A. G. Lawrence records it, at the same lake, as early as May 5\r\nand as late as June 2; he calls it \"uncommon to fairly common.\" At\r\nBeaver Lake, in northern Alberta, William Rowan saw flocks of from 20 to\r\n25 birds every day from May 20 to 28, 1924. P. L. Hatch (1892) says\r\nthat, in Minnesota, \"they come in small flocks, and keep mostly about\r\nshallow ponds, and along the smaller streams flowing through the\r\nmarshes,\" but he has \"found them on the sandy beaches of some of the\r\nlarger lakes on several occasions.\" He says \"they are shy and\r\nexceedingly vigilant, making it no easy matter to get them.\"\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Comparatively little is known about the nesting habits of\r\nthe stilt sandpiper. Roderick MacFarlane (1891) found it \"fairly\r\nabundant on the shores of Franklin Bay, where a number of nests with\r\neggs and young were discovered. It is, however, very rare in the\r\ninterior, only one nest having been taken at Rendezvous Lake on the\r\nborders of the wooded country east of Fort Anderson.\" A nest with three\r\neggs, found on June 22, 1863, is described in his notes as \"near a small\r\nlake and composed of a few decayed leaves placed in a depression in the\r\nground, partly concealed by a tuft of grass;\" the female was flushed off\r\nthe nest and shot. The nest found at Rendezvous Lake is not described,\r\nbut one found at Franklin Bay, on July 6 or 8, 1865, containing four\r\nfresh eggs, was \"a mere depression in the ground, lined with a few\r\nwithered leaves and grasses.\"\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Four eggs is probably the usual number laid by the stilt\r\nsandpiper. They are ovate pyriform in shape. The only eggs I have been\r\nable to locate are the three sets in the United States National Museum,\r\ncollected by MacFarlane. J. H. Riley has kindly sent me descriptions and\r\nmeasurements of these. In the set of four eggs the ground color is\r\n\"ivory yellow\" with large irregular blotches and spots of two shades of\r\n\"mummy brown,\" and a few rather large shell markings of \"hair brown,\"\r\nthe latter mostly towards the larger end. The spots and blotches are a\r\nlittle heavier towards the larger end, also, but in no sense do they\r\nform a ring. Another set of two eggs is similar, but the spots and\r\nblotches are much smaller, more numerous, and more evenly distributed\r\nover the surface; some of the \"mummy brown\" spots are even becoming\r\nscrawls. The third set of two eggs are like the set of four, except that\r\nthe ground color is \"pale olive buff\" and the \"mummy brown\" blotches are\r\non the average smaller. The measurements of these 7 eggs average 35.5 by\r\n25.1 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes =36= by 25, 35 by\r\n=26=, =35= by 25 and 36 by =24.5= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Mr. McFarlane (1891) says: \"On one occasion we could not help\r\nadmiring the courage and ingenuity displayed by both parents in defense\r\nof their young, which resulted in saving two of the latter from\r\ncapture.\"\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--In natal down the stilt sandpiper closely resembles several\r\nof the other species of tundra-nesting sandpipers. It can generally be\r\nrecognized by its relatively longer legs and by its longer bill, with a\r\nbroader tip. The head markings are also a little different. The\r\nforehead, cheeks, and throat are dirty white, with a broad, black,\r\nmedian stripe from bill to crown, another (loral) from bill to eye, and\r\na short one (malar) below it. The crown, back, wings, thighs, and rump\r\nare variegated or marbled with black (predominating) and dull browns,\r\n\"tawny\" to \"ochraceous tawny,\" and profusely dotted with dull white\r\nterminal down tufts; these dots form a distinct circle around the crown\r\npatch, below which the whitish sides of the head are marked with\r\n\"ochraceous tawny.\" The lower throat is washed with pale buff, and the\r\nrest of the under parts are white.\r\n\r\nIn the juvenal plumage in August the head and neck are streaked with\r\ngray and whitish; the crown is dusky, with buffy edgings; the mantle is\r\nbrownish black and dusky, with \"tawny\" edgings on the blackest feathers\r\nin the back and scapulars, and with pale buff or whitish edgings on the\r\nrest of the mantle and tertials; the under parts are white, suffused\r\nwith pale buff on the throat, breast, and flanks; the wing coverts are\r\nedged with pale buff or whitish; the upper tail coverts are white and\r\nbut little marked; the central tail feathers are dusky, edged with\r\nwhite, and the others are white, margined with dusky. This plumage is\r\nnot worn long, for the postjuvenal molt of the body plumage begins late\r\nin August and lasts through September, producing a first-winter plumage.\r\nThis is similar to the winter plumage of adults, but can be recognized\r\nby the juvenal wing coverts, some scapulars, and tertials.\r\n\r\nI have been unable to trace the first prenuptial molt of young birds,\r\nwhich is probably accomplished in South America, nor have I been able to\r\nrecognize a first nuptial plumage. Possibly young birds may not come\r\nnorth during their first spring.\r\n\r\nAdults have a partial prenuptial molt in April and May, involving the\r\nbody plumage, most of the scapulars, and some of the wing coverts and\r\ntertials. The complete postnuptial molt begins sometimes during the\r\nfirst week in July and sometimes not until the last of that month, and\r\nis completed in about two months, including the wings. A specimen taken\r\nin Argentina on September 21 had renewed the wings and practically all\r\nof the body plumage. In winter plumage the upper parts are brownish\r\ngray, with narrow, light edgings; the sides of the head and the under\r\nparts are white, with little or no barring; there is a dark streak\r\nthrough the eye, but no rusty on the head.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Audubon (1840) watched a flock of about 30 stilt sandpipers\r\nfeeding, of which he writes:\r\n\r\n     I saw a flock of about 30 long-legged sandpipers alight within 10\r\n     steps of me, near the water. They immediately scattered, following\r\n     the margin of the retiring and advancing waves, in search of food,\r\n     which I could see them procure by probing the wet sand in the\r\n     manner of curlews, that is, to the full length of their bill,\r\n     holding it for a short time in the sand, as if engaging in sucking\r\n     up what they found. In this way they continued feeding on an\r\n     extended line of shore of about 30 yards, and it was pleasing to\r\n     see the alacrity with which they simultaneously advanced and\r\n     retreated, according to the motions of the water. In about\r\n     three-quarters of an hour, during all which time I had watched them\r\n     with attention, they removed a few yards beyond the highest wash of\r\n     the waves, huddled close together, and began to plume and cleanse\r\n     themselves. In the stomachs of several individuals I found small\r\n     worms, minute shellfish, and vegetable substances, among which were\r\n     the hard seeds of plants unknown to me.\r\n\r\nN.B. Moore watched a stilt sandpiper feeding in Florida and says in his\r\nnotes:\r\n\r\n     It alighted within 20 feet of me and commenced feeding at once, in\r\n     water that nearly covered the tarsi. I was surprised to see it\r\n     slowly step along, carrying its bill immersed nearly up to the\r\n     base, and sweeping it slowly from side to side, much in the manner\r\n     of the roseate spoonbills, which were at the same moment feeding\r\n     near by. I noticed no action like that of swallowing at any time,\r\n     its motions being continuous--as described--until I shot it to make\r\n     sure of the species.\r\n\r\nStuart T. Danforth (1925) says of the food of this species in Porto\r\nRico:\r\n\r\n     Seven stomachs (five collected on August 20 and two on September\r\n     17) were available for examination. Animal matter composed 70.1 per\r\n     cent of the food, and vegetable matter of 29.9 per cent. Bloodworms\r\n     (Chironomid larvae) were the largest food item, forming 72.8 per\r\n     cent of the animal food. From 150 to 600 bloodworms were found in\r\n     all but two of the stomachs. Dytiscid larvae formed 15.5 per cent,\r\n     small Planorbis snails 7.1 per cent, and mosquito larvae 0.8 per\r\n     cent of the animal matter. The vegetable matter was composed of\r\n     seeds. Seeds of _Persicaria_ formed 80 per cent of the vegetable\r\n     matter; seeds of _Sesban emerus_ 7 per cent; seeds of Compositae\r\n     10.2 per cent, and rubbish 2.8 per cent.\r\n\r\nProf. William Rowan writes to me:\r\n\r\n     In very dirty weather, particularly if a gale is blowing, stilt\r\n     sandpipers have been noted hunting for food high and dry on rough\r\n     pasture. This is probably an exceptional performance correlated\r\n     with this type of weather, for it has never been observed at other\r\n     times.\r\n\r\nJohn T. Nichols says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     Just how this species makes use of its somewhat peculiar bill is\r\n     not very clear. I have seen it alighted on flooded dead marsh,\r\n     wading in the puddles and picking at the projecting dead stubble\r\n     about on its own level. Again I find in my journal reference to\r\n     three birds which alighted in water to their thighs, and\r\n     immediately began to feed, moving about close together, immersing\r\n     the bill to the eyes for an instant or two.\r\n\r\nVerdi Burtch (1925), referring to a bird he saw at Branchport, N.Y.,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     I saw it catch and with much effort swallow a small frog, after\r\n     which it lost all interest in fishing. It walked off a few steps\r\n     and stood on one foot, all humped up and with eyes closed; quite a\r\n     contrast to the usual alert sandpiper pose.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Audubon (1840) writes:\r\n\r\n     The flight of these sandpipers is rapid and regular. They move\r\n     compactly, and often when about to alight, or after being\r\n     disturbed, incline their bodies to either side, showing alternately\r\n     the upper and lower parts. On foot they move more like curlews than\r\n     tringas, they being as it were more sedate in their deportment. At\r\n     times, on the approach of a person, they squat on the ground, very\r\n     much in the manner of the Esquimaux curlew, _Numenius borealis_;\r\n     and their flesh is as delicate as that of the species just named.\r\n\r\nDr. Arthur A. Allen (1913), after referring to the companionship and\r\nresemblance between stilt sandpipers and lesser yellow-legs, says:\r\n\r\n     In their habits, however, the two species were quite different. The\r\n     yellow-legs were always rangy birds and covered a great deal of\r\n     ground while feeding. Even when resting they were conspicuous by\r\n     the nervous jerking of the head and neck. In flight they usually\r\n     formed fairly compact flocks but scattered upon alighting. The\r\n     stilt sandpipers, on the other hand, were quiet birds and went\r\n     about their search for food very systematically, gleaning\r\n     everything in their way. They frequently fed in a space a few yards\r\n     square for over an hour at a time. When at rest they showed none of\r\n     the nervous traits of the yellow-legs, being much more sedate,\r\n     neither jerking the head nor tilting the tail. In flight they were\r\n     quite similar to the yellow-legs, but as soon as they alighted they\r\n     bunched and frequently the whole flock fed with their bodies nearly\r\n     touching. Like the yellow-legs, the stilt sandpipers were seldom\r\n     seen upon the exposed mud but preferred wading where the water was\r\n     from 1 to 3 inches in depth, so that the entire head and neck\r\n     frequently disappeared beneath the surface of the water while\r\n     feeding. The notes of the two birds, though similar in form, were\r\n     wholly unlike in quality, that of the stilt sandpiper being\r\n     mellower and lower in pitch.\r\n\r\nCoues (1878) at first mistook birds of this species for dowitchers and\r\ndid not recognize them until he had them in his hands. He says:\r\n\r\n     They gathered in the same compact groups, waded about in the same\r\n     sedate, preoccupied manner, fed with the same motion of the head,\r\n     probing obliquely in shallow water with the head submerged, were\r\n     equally oblivious of my approach, and when wounded swam with equal\r\n     facility. The close structural resemblances of the two species are\r\n     evidently reflected in their general economy.\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     On alighting the stilt sandpiper sometimes lifts its wings halfway\r\n     for an instant, a mannerism characteristic of the tattler group,\r\n     which it would seem to have acquired from its associate, the\r\n     yellow-legs.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Following are Mr. Nichols's notes on this subject:\r\n\r\n     The common flight note of the stilt sandpiper is very like the\r\n     single whistled _whu_ of the lesser yellow-legs, but recognizably\r\n     lower pitched and hoarser, at times with a quaver, _whr-r-u_, and\r\n     varying down to a shorter, less loud _whrug_. An unloud, reedy\r\n     _sher_ has been heard from two birds when flushing.\r\n\r\n     Though with different feeding habits, stilt sandpiper, dowitcher,\r\n     and lesser yellow-legs frequent the same grounds, associate very\r\n     freely on the wing, and all three have a very similar flight note,\r\n     though sufficiently different for identification. Perhaps the very\r\n     lack of close relationship in these birds has facilitated\r\n     convergence of their habits and calls, and it is not unreasonable\r\n     to suppose that close association, even imitation, has played some\r\n     part in bringing about the likeness of their voices. The greater\r\n     yellow-legs differs more from the lesser, both in flight note and\r\n     flight habits, than do these other two unrelated species.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--I quote again from Mr. Nichols's notes on field\r\ncharacters, as follows:\r\n\r\n     On the wing the stilt sandpiper resembles the lesser yellow-legs\r\n     closely. Its smaller size is scarcely appreciable, even in a flock\r\n     of yellow-legs, the members of which will usually be at slightly\r\n     varying distances from the observer. Adults have appreciably darker\r\n     (barred) lower parts, and young birds, particularly, are greyer\r\n     above than yellow-legs at the same season in this latitude. The\r\n     somewhat shorter legs do not project so far beyond the tail, but\r\n     the proportionately longer bill (with slight apparent drop at its\r\n     tip) is the stilt sandpiper's best field mark. Its bill is\r\n     proportionately longer even than that of the greater yellow-legs,\r\n     with which this species is unlikely to be confused, varying as it\r\n     does away from the lesser yellow-legs in an opposite direction, both\r\n     as regards size and in other subtle characters. The head and neck\r\n     of a yellow-legs are more \"shapely,\" differing in this respect\r\n     somewhat as a black duck differs from sea ducks.\r\n\r\n     On the ground the stilt sandpiper stands lower than a yellow-legs,\r\n     having decidedly shorter legs, and correspondingly higher than our\r\n     other shore birds of the same size. The color of its legs, dull\r\n     olive green, is usually diagnostic. The legs are sometimes\r\n     yellowish, and very rarely yellow, only one such having come under\r\n     the writer's personal notice, a young bird in southward migration.\r\n     The name \"greenleg\" is often used for it by Long Island baymen,\r\n     who also suspect it of being a cross between yellow-legs and\r\n     dowitcher. At sufficiently close range the margination of the\r\n     feathers of the upper parts is quite unlike the spotting of the\r\n     yellow-legs' plumage.\r\n\r\nThe broad white stripe over the eye is conspicuous in any plumage and\r\nthe whitish tail shows in flight, as different from the whitish triangle\r\non the rump and back of the dowitcher or the white rump of the\r\nyellow-legs. Most of these field marks, however, are too subtle for easy\r\nrecognition, unless seen under favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\nProf. William Rowan has sent me the following notes:\r\n\r\n     Identification marks of the stilt are excellent and it is quite an\r\n     easy bird to spot in almost any circumstances. It has a rump\r\n     pattern all to itself and is therefore readily detected in flight.\r\n     The end of the tail is darker than that of a yellow-legs, but the\r\n     white of the rump end, instead of forming a straight line across\r\n     the back, is horseshoe shaped. Although the turnstone and\r\n     semipalmated plovers are reminiscent, they are quite distinct and\r\n     not to be confused. When wading--the birds prefer to be belly\r\n     deep--the carriage of the head makes the species unmistakable. The\r\n     bill is always held and thrust beneath the surface perpendicularly.\r\n     This necessitates a straight neck. In profile the feeding\r\n     individual can be mistaken for no other sandpiper, is quite\r\n     distinct from the yellow-legs, and can really only be confused with\r\n     a phalarope. The Wilson phalarope habitually wades in this part of\r\n     the world, swimming only occasionally, but its markings are\r\n     distinctive. A flock of stilts is the most characteristic sight and\r\n     the species can be identified at a great distance. The curious\r\n     position of the head just referred to and the crowding of the\r\n     individuals into each other make a quite unmistakable combination.\r\n     They feed practically shoulder to shoulder, seldom scattering. The\r\n     yellow-legs of a flock are always scattered, and the general aspect\r\n     of the individuals is entirely different. Stilts never bob their\r\n     heads after the manner of yellow-legs.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--The fall migration of adults begins very early, coming along\r\nwith the dowitchers and first summer yellow-legs. I have an adult female\r\nin my collection, taken on July 5, 1885, on Monomoy Island,\r\nMassachusetts. The main flight of adults comes along during the latter\r\nhalf of July and first half of August, in this State, and the young\r\nbirds come through in August and September; but this is a rare bird\r\nhere, and the flight generally lasts for only a few days.\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols tells me that:\r\n\r\n     On Long Island the stilt sandpiper is usually uncommon, occurring\r\n     in small numbers often closely associated with lesser yellow-legs or\r\n     dowitcher. Rarely it occurs in great waves or flights as on August\r\n     12, 1912. This flight was made up exclusively of adult birds, so\r\n     far as the writer's observations went. For the remainder of that\r\n     season the species was unusually common. If, in ordinary years,\r\n     some 200 stilt sandpipers are present on Long Island in southward\r\n     migration, there were probably 3,000 in 1912. The earliest I have\r\n     seen this species south on Long Island is July 10, 1921, two or\r\n     three or more individuals associated with 40 or 50 lesser\r\n     yellow-legs.\r\n\r\nIn the interior this species is commoner than it is on the Atlantic\r\ncoast. Mr. Harrold says that in Manitoba it is fairly common in the\r\nfall, adults being noted as early as July 5; the young birds are usually\r\nwith the lesser yellow-legs in the fall. Mr. Hersey collected a series\r\nfor me in Manitoba between July 18 and 29, 1913. Stilt sandpipers were\r\nformerly sold in the markets, mixed with bunches of summer yellow-legs,\r\nbut their sale is now prohibited, and they are too small to be\r\nconsidered as game birds.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--The winter home of the stilt sandpiper seems to be in\r\nsouthern South America, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Chile, but\r\nactual records substantiated by specimens are not numerous. Ernest\r\nGibson (1920) shot some \"out of a flock of over 100\" which \"might easily\r\nhave been 200, so closely were they massed.\" They \"were feeding on\r\nmarshy ground; and as the flock rose at\" his \"approach, circled and\r\npassed away, the white under surfaces were quite dazzling in the\r\nsunlight.\" This was near Cape San Antonio, Buenos Aires, on December 27,\r\n1913.\r\n\r\nDr. Alexander Wetmore (1926) writes:\r\n\r\n     The stilt sandpiper was encountered only in the Chaco, west of\r\n     Puerto Pinasco, Paraguay, though it has been said that it is common\r\n     in some parts of the Province of Buenos Aires in winter. At\r\n     kilometer 80, on September 20, 1920, the first arrivals, a flock of\r\n     a dozen, were recorded at the border of a lagoon; as I watched they\r\n     rose suddenly to whirl rapidly away to the southward. On the\r\n     following day about 20 were seen, and an adult female was taken. At\r\n     Kilometer 170, on September 24, a small flock passed down the\r\n     nearly dry channel of an alkaline stream known as the Riacho\r\n     Salado, while at Laguna Wall (kilometer 200) about 30 were seen\r\n     September 24, and 40 on the day following. The birds were found in\r\n     little flocks, often mingled with other waders that walked or waded\r\n     through shallow water on muddy shores where they probed with their\r\n     bills for food.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North America, south to southern South America. The stilt\r\nsandpiper is one of the rarer shore birds and but little is known of its\r\nrange and migrations.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--North to probably northeastern Alaska (Demarcation\r\nPoint); probably Yukon (Herschel Island); Mackenzie (Fort Anderson,\r\nRendezvous Lake, Franklin Bay, and probably Kogaryuak River); and\r\nprobably Keewatin (Cape Eskimo). East to probably Keewatin (Cape\r\nEskimo); and probably Manitoba (Fort Churchill and York Factory). South\r\nto probably Manitoba (York Factory); and Mackenzie (Artillery Lake).\r\nWest to Mackenzie (Artillery Lake); and probably Alaska (Demarcation\r\nPoint). Eggs have been taken only in northern Mackenzie.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--Imperfectly known, but probably north to Tepic\r\n(Acaponeta River); Zacatecas; Tamaulipas (Matamoros); rarely Texas\r\n(Corpus Christi); rarely Louisiana (State Game Preserve); and Cuba. East\r\nprobably to Cuba; and Brazil (Ilha Grande). South probably to Brazil\r\n(Ilha Grande); Uruguay (Colonia); and Chile. West to Chile; Bolivia\r\n(Falls of the Madeira); central Peru (Chorillos and Yquitos); Ecuador\r\n(Babahoyo); Colombia (Cienaga); Nicaragua (_=Momotombo=_); Guatemala\r\n(Duenas); Oaxaca (Tehuantepec); Jalisco (Manzanillo and La Barca); and\r\nTepic (Ocaponeta River).\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--Early dates of arrival in the spring are: Florida,\r\nBanana Creek, March 10, Smyrna, March 26, and Pensacola, April 5; North\r\nCarolina, Cape Hatteras, May 19; New York, Long Island, May 18;\r\nConnecticut, Westport, May 28, and West Haven, May 30; Rhode Island,\r\nSakonnet, May 9; Maine, Saco, May 5; Missouri, Kansas City, April 30;\r\nIllinois, Chicago, May 26; Iowa, Sioux City, May 7, Emmetsburg, May 10,\r\nand Wall Lake, May 23; Wisconsin, Racine, April 10; Minnesota, Wilder,\r\nMay 1, and Waseca, May 14; Texas, Bonham, March 29; Kansas, McPherson,\r\nMay 7; Nebraska, Kearney, May 6, and Neligh, May 10; South Dakota,\r\nHarrison, May 5, Vermilion, May 9, and Sioux Falls, May 14; North\r\nDakota, Harrisburg, May 1, and Sweetwater, May 5; Manitoba, Whitewater\r\nLake, May 12; Colorado, Barr, April 27, Fort Lyon, May 2, Colorado\r\nSprings, May 14, and Loveland, May 20; Wyoming, Cheyenne, May 25;\r\nAlberta, Fort Chipewyan, June 6; Mackenzie, Fort Resolution, May 19, and\r\nAthabaska delta, June 4; and Alaska, Demarcation Point, May 23.\r\n\r\nStilt sandpipers also have been detected as late as April in Cuba and\r\nJamaica while a late date for their departure from Lake Palomas, Mexico,\r\nis April 7, from Dummetts, Florida, April 14 and Port Orange, Florida,\r\nMay 5.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--Early dates of arrival for the species on its return\r\nfrom the North are: Colorado, Barr, July 5; North Dakota, Benson County,\r\nJuly 1, and Nelson's Lake, July 14; South Dakota, Forestburg, July 7;\r\nNebraska, Lincoln, July 19; Iowa, Sioux City, July 12; Texas Corpus\r\nChristi, July 3; Ontario, Toronto, July 18; Maine, Chebeague Island,\r\nJuly 19, and Scarboro, July 30; New Hampshire, Rye, July 31;\r\nMassachusetts, Cape Cod, July 4, and Needham, July 24; Rhode Island,\r\nNewport, July 6, and Block Island, July 15; New York, East Hampton, July\r\n11; North Carolina, Churches Island, July 29; Bahama Islands, Fortune\r\nIsland, August 5; Barbados, July; St. Batholomew, September; and\r\nParaguay, Kilometer 80, September 20.\r\n\r\nLate dates of fall departure are: British Columbia, Sumas Lake,\r\nSeptember 19; Colorado, Fort Lyon, September 8, Larimer County,\r\nSeptember 9, and Barr, October 5; Mackenzie, Fort Simpson, August 19,\r\nand Lower Slave River, August 27; Manitoba, Carberry, August 29, and\r\nQu'Appelle, September 16; Nebraska, Lincoln, November 11; Kansas,\r\nLawrence, September 19; Wisconsin, Kelley Brook, September 13; Iowa,\r\nBurlington, September 28; Ontario, Toronto, September 26; Ohio,\r\nColumbus, October 4; Illinois, Chicago, September 1, Grand Crossing,\r\nSeptember 23, and Cantine Lake, September 28; Missouri, St. Louis,\r\nSeptember 12, and Kansas City, September 28; Maine, Scarboro, September\r\n16; Massachusetts, Chatham, September 20, and Cape Cod, September 29;\r\nRhode Island, Newport, September 9; New York, Buffalo, September 16,\r\nBronx, September 19, Cayuga, October 10, and Jamaica, November 28; New\r\nJersey, Morristown, October 16; Maryland, Pawtuxent River, September 8;\r\nDistrict of Columbia, Anacostia River, October 26; North Carolina,\r\nChurches Island, September 23; and Florida, Fernandina, October 10, and\r\nKey West, November 1.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--The rarity of the stilt sandpiper makes it difficult\r\nto determine whether some occurrences should be listed as regular\r\nmigrants or as accidentals. Some of the following cases may be on the\r\nregular migration route of the species: Bermuda, two early in August,\r\n1848 and one in early September, 1875; Newfoundland, Cow Head,\r\nSeptember, 1867; Nova Scotia, Sable Island, August 18, 1902; New\r\nBrunswick, Courtenay Bay, September 8, 1881; and Montana, Chief\r\nMountain, August, 1874.\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Arctic Canada: 3 records, June 22 and 27 and July 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIDRIS CANUTUS RUFUS (Wilson)\r\n\r\nAMERICAN KNOT\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThis cosmopolitan species, with a circumpolar breeding range, has been\r\nsplit into two generally recognized forms occupying the two hemispheres,\r\nwith a doubtful third form, _rodgersi_, said to occupy eastern Asia. Our\r\nAmerican bird is well named _rufus_ on account of its color.\r\n\r\nThe knot, or redbreast, as it is called on Cape Cod, was a very abundant\r\nmigrant all along the Atlantic coast of North America during the past\r\ncentury. George H. Mackay (1893) writes:\r\n\r\n     On the Dennis marshes and flats, at Chatham, the Nauset, Wellfleet,\r\n     and Billingsgate, Cape Cod, and on the flats around Tuckernuck and\r\n     Muskeget Islands, Mass., they used to be more numerous than in all\r\n     the rest of New England combined, and being very gregarious they\r\n     would collect in those places in exceedingly large numbers,\r\n     estimates of which were useless. This was previous to 1850 and when\r\n     the Cape Cod Railroad was completed only to Sandwich. Often, when\r\n     riding on the top of the stage coach on the cape beyond this point,\r\n     immense numbers of these birds could be seen, as they rose up in\r\n     clouds, during the period that they sojourned there. It was at this\r\n     time that the vicious practice of \"fire-lighting\" them prevailed,\r\n     and a very great number of them were thus killed on the flats at\r\n     night in the vicinity of Billingsgate (near Wellfleet). The mode of\r\n     procedure was for two men to start out after dark at half tide, one\r\n     of them to carry a lighted lantern, the other to reach and seize\r\n     the birds, bite their necks, and put them in a bag slung over the\r\n     shoulder. When near a flock they would approach them on their hands\r\n     and knees, the birds being almost invariably taken on the flats.\r\n     This practice continued several years before it was finally\r\n     prohibited by law. I have it directly from an excellent authority\r\n     that he has seen in the spring, six barrels of these birds (all of\r\n     which had been taken in this manner) at one time, on the deck of\r\n     the Cape Cod packet for Boston. He has also seen barrels of them,\r\n     which had spoiled during the voyage, thrown overboard in Boston\r\n     Harbor on arrival of the packet. The price of these birds at that\r\n     time was 10 cents per dozen; mixed with them would be turnstones\r\n     and black-bellied plover. Not one of these birds had been shot, all\r\n     having been taken with the aid of a \"fire-light.\"\r\n\r\nArthur T. Wayne (1910) says:\r\n\r\n     On May 18, 1895, I saw, on Long Island beach, a flock of these\r\n     birds which I estimated to contain fully fifteen hundred\r\n     individuals, while on May 21 of the same year, I observed a flock\r\n     that had alighted on the beach, and that comprised without a doubt\r\n     more than 3,000 birds.\r\n\r\nExcessive shooting, both in spring and fall, reduced this species to a\r\npitiful remnant of its former numbers; but spring shooting was stopped\r\nbefore it was too late and afterwards this bird was wisely taken off the\r\nlist of game birds; it has increased slowly since then, but it is far\r\nfrom abundant now and makes only a short stay on Cape Cod.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The main migration route of the knot in spring is northward\r\nalong the Atlantic coast. The first birds usually reach the United\r\nStates from South America early in April. On the west coast of Florida,\r\nin 1925, I took my first birds on April 2, and they were commonest about\r\nthe middle of April. I have found them very common on the coast of South\r\nCarolina as late as May 23. Mr. Mackay (1893) writes:\r\n\r\n     They are still found in greater or less numbers along the Atlantic\r\n     coast south of Chesapeake Bay. Near Charleston, S. C., Mr. William\r\n     Brewster noted about 150 knots on May 6 and 8, 1885, and saw a\r\n     number of flocks on May 13. They were flying by, or were alighted,\r\n     on Sullivan Island beach. On May 17, 1883, he noted about 100 of\r\n     these birds in the same locality. In the spring they pass Charlotte\r\n     Harbor, Florida, so I am informed, in large numbers, coming up the\r\n     coast from the south (a flight on May 26, 1890), at which time they\r\n     are very tame. They are also more or less numerous near Morehead\r\n     City, North Carolina (where they are known as \"beach robins\"), from\r\n     May 15 to 30, their flight being along the beach, just over the\r\n     surf, at early morning, coming from the east in the neighborhood of\r\n     Point Lookout, 10 or 12 miles away, where they probably resorted to\r\n     roost. This indicates that these birds were living in that\r\n     locality.\r\n\r\nOn the Massachusetts coast the spring flight comes in May. Mr. Mackay\r\n(1893) says:\r\n\r\n     The most favorable time to expect them at this season is during\r\n     fine, soft, south to southwest weather, and formerly they could be\r\n     expected to pass in numbers between May 20 and June 5. In former\r\n     times, when such conditions prevailed, thousands collected on Cape\r\n     Cod, when they would remain for a few days to a week before\r\n     resuming migration.\r\n\r\nThe knot is less common in the interior, but Prof. William Rowan\r\nevidently regards it as a regular migrant in Alberta during the latter\r\npart of May; his notes record a flock of about 200 on May 21 and one of\r\nover 150 on May 23.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a comparatively rare migrant on the coast of California,\r\nwhere it never was abundant. But it still occurs in large numbers on the\r\ncoast of Washington. In some notes from Gray's Harbor, sent to me by D.\r\nE. Brown, he mentions a flock of over 500 birds seen on May 14, 1920.\r\nAnd S. F. Rathbun has sent me the following notes:\r\n\r\n     Late on the afternoon of May 16, 1921, we were on the south side of\r\n     Gray's Harbor, Washington, on a marsh meadow bordered by the tide\r\n     flats. At this hour the tide was nearly at its full, and the many\r\n     shore birds that had been feeding on the flats were forced to\r\n     retreat before the incoming waters and in consequence were driven\r\n     close to the edge of the meadow. Not far from where we lay\r\n     concealed a very large number of these had assembled on a somewhat\r\n     elevated stretch of ground near the meadows border, among them\r\n     being several hundred of the knots, these in two or three compact\r\n     flocks all the individuals of which were facing the wind. The knots\r\n     were resting quietly although there was much movement going on\r\n     among the shore birds. We could easily by the aid of our glasses,\r\n     see many turnstones, a few greater yellow-legs, these keeping by\r\n     themselves, and in the shallow water at the edge of the flats a\r\n     very large number of red-backed sandpipers and long-billed\r\n     dowitchers, flanked by an immense flock of the smaller sandpipers.\r\n     At this time the sun was low in the west and its almost horizontal\r\n     rays fell full on the breasts of the knots, for in facing the wind\r\n     they happened to be turned toward the sun, whose light intensified\r\n     the pale cinnamon of their breasts, this making a beautiful sight.\r\n\r\n     Without any warning nearly all of this mass of birds suddenly took\r\n     wing. As they rose, the knots keeping by themselves separated into\r\n     three compact flocks and rising high in the air then flew directly\r\n     towards the north giving their calls as they did so, and this\r\n     appears to be a habit of the species when taking wing. Again, the\r\n     knot does not appear to fly aimlessly about as do many other of\r\n     the shore birds, and is generally to be seen in flocks, the\r\n     individuals of which are closely associated, although at times\r\n     scattering birds will be observed; and in flight by the seeming\r\n     course a flock will pursue, we always receive an impression that\r\n     it has some objective point in view.\r\n\r\nDr. W. E. Ekblaw has sent me some very full notes on the habits of the\r\nknot in northwestern Greenland in which he says:\r\n\r\n     The knot is one of the commoner shore birds of northwest Greenland,\r\n     but even so, not numerous anywhere. It arrives in the land as early\r\n     as the end of May, for early in the spring of 1915 when my two\r\n     Eskimos, Esayoo and Etukashoo, and I were encamped at Fort Conger\r\n     on Discovery Harbor in latitude 81° 45´ N., we heard the keen call\r\n     of the knots flying over our camp the afternoon of May 30. The\r\n     first knots that come are generally in small flocks, but they soon\r\n     mate and scatter to their nesting places, only a few coming\r\n     together from time to time near the favorite feeding places. If the\r\n     weather of early June be inclement the flocks do not scatter so\r\n     soon, but remain together until the conditions become favorable for\r\n     mating and nesting. It is quite likely that some of the pairs are\r\n     already mated when they arrive, for the sex organs are fully\r\n     developed and ready to function upon their arrival.\r\n\r\nIn northeastern Greenland the time of arrival is about the same, for A.\r\nL. Manniche (1910) writes:\r\n\r\n     The knots arrived at the Stormkap territory in couples at exactly\r\n     the same time as did the other waders; in two summers,\r\n     respectively, on June 2 and May 28. While the sanderlings, dunlins,\r\n     turnstones, and ringed plovers immediately took to the sparsely\r\n     occurring spots free from snow, the knots would prefer to go to the\r\n     still snow-covered hollows in the marshes and moors, where I saw\r\n     them running on the snow eagerly occupied in picking up the seed of\r\n     _Carex_-and _Luzula_-tufts the ends of which here and there\r\n     appeared over the snow. This sandpiper more than its relatives,\r\n     feeds on plants at certain seasons. In the first days I also\r\n     observed now and then a couple of knots on snowless spots on\r\n     elevated table-lands and even on the top of the high gravel banks\r\n     at Stormkap. These may, however, have settled there in order to\r\n     rest after the voyage and not to search food. As soon as ponds of\r\n     melting snow and fresh-water beaches free from ice were to be\r\n     found, the knots would resort to these, and here the birds wading\r\n     or swimming looked for animal diet. In this season the knot did not\r\n     appear on the salt-water shore like other waders. Gradually as more\r\n     extensive stretches of low-lying table-land became free from snow,\r\n     the knots occurred more frequently here in their real nesting\r\n     quarters; they would, however, still for a while often visit moors\r\n     and marshes with a rich vegetation of _Cyperaceae_.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Doctor Ekblaw describes this as follows:\r\n\r\n     The courtship is brief but ardent. Whether it is the females that\r\n     woo the males, as among the phalaropes, or as normally the males\r\n     that woo the females, it is difficult to determine, for the\r\n     breeding plumages of the two sexes are quite indistinguishable. On\r\n     June 3, 1916, I observed closely the courtship of three knots high\r\n     up on one of the plateaus of Numataksuah, back of North Star Bay.\r\n     Two males (?) were evidently pursuing one female (?), she leading,\r\n     they winging rapidly in her wake, contending as they flew;\r\n     apparently all uttered the shrill piercing call to which the knots\r\n     so frequently give voice during the mating and nesting season of\r\n     early summer, and which one rarely, if ever, hears after the young\r\n     are hatched. In great circles they flew, now and then stooping to a\r\n     zigzag pirouetting and dodging, again rising in wide circles until\r\n     they disappeared from sight in the bright sky, though their shrill\r\n     calls came to earth as sharp and clear as ever.\r\n\r\n     In the ecstasy of the mating season a single bird may indulge\r\n     himself (?) in a kind of dance flight alone. He rises high above\r\n     the hills, sweeping the sky in great graceful circles not unlike\r\n     the stately flight of the sparrow hawk, so smooth and calm it\r\n     seems. From time to time he utters the shrill, clarion call of the\r\n     mating season, or the soft _coo-yee_ that is most common about the\r\n     nesting grounds. Then suddenly he drops wildly, tumbling and\r\n     tossing like a night jar at sunset, as suddenly to break his fall\r\n     and soar for miles on still, outstretched wings, not a movement\r\n     noticeable.\r\n\r\nMr. Manniche (1910) refers to it as follows:\r\n\r\n     The male suddenly gets up from the snow-clad ground, and producing\r\n     the most beautiful flutelike notes, following an oblique line with\r\n     rapid wing strokes, mounts to an enormous height often so high that\r\n     he can not be followed with the naked eye. Up here in the clear\r\n     frosty air he flies around in large circles on quivering wings and\r\n     his melodious far-sounding notes are heard far and wide over the\r\n     country, bringing joy to other birds of his own kin. The song\r\n     sounds now more distant, now nearer, when three or four males are\r\n     singing at the same time. Now and then the bird slides slowly\r\n     downwards on stiff wings with the tail feathers spread; then again\r\n     he makes himself invisible in the higher regions of the air,\r\n     mounting on wings quivering even faster than before. Only now and\r\n     then the observer--guided by the continuing song--succeeds for a\r\n     moment in discerning the bird at a certain attitude of flight, when\r\n     the strong sunlight falls upon his golden-colored breast or light\r\n     wings. Gradually, as in increasing excitement he executes the\r\n     convulsive vibrations of his wings, his song changes to single\r\n     deeper notes--following quickly after each other--at last to die\r\n     out while the bird at the same time drops to the earth on stiff\r\n     wings strongly bent upward. This fine pairing song may be heard for\r\n     more than a month everywhere at the breeding places, and it\r\n     wonderfully enlivens this generally so desolate and silent nature.\r\n     The song will at certain stages remind of the fluting call note of\r\n     the curlew (_Numenius arquatus_), but it varies so much with the\r\n     temper of the bird that it can hardly be expressed or compared with\r\n     anything else.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The nesting habits of the knot long remained unknown; Arctic\r\nexplorers were baffled in their attempts to find the nest; and the eggs\r\nwere among the greatest desiderata of collectors. This is not to be\r\nwondered at, however, when we consider the remoteness of its far\r\nnorthern breeding grounds, its choice of its nesting sites on high\r\ninland plains, its widely scattered nests, and its habit of sitting very\r\nclosely on its eggs and not returning to them after flushing. Col. H. W.\r\nFeilden (1879) writes:\r\n\r\n     Night after night I passed out on the hills trying to find the nest\r\n     of the knot. Not a day passed without my seeing them feeding in\r\n     small flocks; but they were very wild, rising with shrill cries\r\n     when one approached within a quarter of a mile of the mud flats on\r\n     which they were feeding. It is very extraordinary, considering the\r\n     hundreds of miles traversed by myself and my companions--all of us\r\n     on the lookout for this bird's eggs, and several of us experienced\r\n     bird's-nesters--that we found no trace of its breeding until the\r\n     young in down were discovered.\r\n\r\nSome of the earlier records of knot's nests are open to doubt, but there\r\ncan be no doubt about the two nests found by Peary in 1909. Referring to\r\nhis own failure and Peary's success, Colonel Feilden (1920) says:\r\n\r\n     The nests and eggs of the knot were obtained by Peary in the\r\n     vicinity of Floeberg Beach where the \"Nares\" expedition of 1875-76\r\n     wintered on the exposed coast of Grinnell Land north of 82° N.\r\n     lat., and where Peary, on the _Roosevelt_, wintered in 1908 and\r\n     1909 at Cape Sheridan some 3 or 4 miles farther north, and which\r\n     was the base for his ever-memorable adventure to the North Pole.\r\n     Probably the reason why we failed in 1876 to obtain the eggs was\r\n     due to our ignorance of the localities selected by the birds for\r\n     nesting. We saw the birds circling over and feeding around the\r\n     small pools of water left by the melted snow, which here and there\r\n     were surrounded by sparse tufts of vegetation, and we gave too much\r\n     of our scanty time to the searching of the marshy spots. Peary's\r\n     photographs show that in Grinnell Land the knot has its nests on\r\n     the more elevated slopes and surfaces covered by frost-riven rocks\r\n     and shales. The finding of a knot's nest in Grinnell Land is not an\r\n     easy task, and it is highly commendable that Peary on his return\r\n     from the North Pole to Cape Sheridan, and in the midst of his\r\n     engrossing and more important duties found occasions to take the\r\n     unique photographs here reproduced.\r\n\r\nTwo nests with eggs were found by the Crockerland expedition in\r\nnorthwestern Greenland, of which Doctor Ekblaw has sent me the following\r\naccount:\r\n\r\n     Though level lands along the shores and the river valleys, or about\r\n     the pools constitute the feeding grounds of the knots, the high\r\n     plateaus far back among the hills, covered with glacial gravel or\r\n     frost-riven rubble, furnish their nesting sites. By this rather\r\n     anomalous choice of nesting site, the knot was long able to keep\r\n     its nest and eggs a secret, and it was not until the members of the\r\n     Crockerland Arctic Expedition persistently ran down every clue that\r\n     two full clutches of eggs in the nests were discovered in June,\r\n     1916, on a high flat-topped ridge back of North Star Bay, at least\r\n     3 miles from shore.\r\n\r\n      The nests are placed in shallow depressions among the brown clumps\r\n      of _Dryas integrifolia_ and _Elyna bellardi_ which grow among the\r\n      rubbles and gravel of the high ridges. The nest is merely a small\r\n      hollow, apparently rudely shaped by the nesting bird. The bird in\r\n      the nest is so like the terrane about her, that she is well-nigh\r\n      indistinguishable from it, even to one who knows exactly where she\r\n      is sitting. Trusting to her effective concealment, the mother bird\r\n      does not flush from the nest until almost pushed from it. When I\r\n      placed a camera only a foot from the sitting bird she did not\r\n      leave it. Though frightened so sorely that she panted and her\r\n      heart beat visibly, she stuck to her precious eggs. Her head\r\n      turned to the wind, she crouched flat upon the eggs, her feathers\r\n      ruffled wide to hide them. When finally I placed my hand upon her,\r\n      she broke away, trying by the well-known shore-bird device of\r\n      feigning injury and inability to fly to draw the intruders away.\r\n      The bird did not appear at all shy and when she failed to draw us\r\n      away, remained near us, evidently anxious, but trying to appear\r\n      unconcerned. Now and then she uttered a soft, but sharply pleading\r\n      call, more plaint than protest. One nesting bird did not leave her\r\n      eggs until Doctor Hunt pushed her, protesting plaintively quite\r\n      away from the nest, with the stock of his rifle.\r\n\r\nA set of four eggs in Edward Arnold's collection was taken by Capt.\r\nJoseph Bernard, July 1, 1918, on Taylor Island, Victoria Land. The nest\r\nwas in a dry spot in a wet marsh; there was a snow bank 50 yards from\r\nthe nest and a pond on the south side of the nest 100 yards away. He\r\nwatched the nest for three or four hours, from a hill 500 yards away,\r\nbut did not see the bird again.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The knot lays four eggs, perhaps sometimes only three. The eggs\r\nare ovate pyriform in shape, with a slight gloss. In the set of three\r\neggs, taken by the Crockerland expedition and now in Col. John E.\r\nThayer's collection, the ground colors vary from \"pale olive buff\" to\r\n\"olive buff\"; they are spotted all over, but more thickly at the larger\r\nend, with small spots or scrawls of \"sepia,\" \"Saccardo's umber,\" and\r\n\"Vandyke brown,\" with underlying spots of \"pallid\" and \"pale brownish\r\ndrab.\"\r\n\r\nThe other set of four eggs, from the same source and now in the American\r\nMuseum of Natural History, is thus described for me by Ludlow Griscom:\r\n\r\n     Ground color varying from white with the faintest tinge of light\r\n     olive (1 egg) to \"olive buff\" (2 eggs) and deep \"olive buff\" (1\r\n     egg); clouded and spotted, especially at the larger end, with\r\n     shades of color varying from \"dark olive buff\" to \"olive brownish,\"\r\n     the intensity varying in direct proportion to the intensity of the\r\n     ground color; where the spots coalesce into blotches at the larger\r\n     end of the darkest egg, the color is blackish brown; the spotting\r\n     is scant at the smaller end.\r\n\r\nReferring in his notes to the same two sets of eggs, Doctor Ekblaw\r\ndescribes the ground colors as varying from very light pea-green, almost\r\ngray, to dark pea-green, \"with brown, umber, and almost black dots and\r\nblotches of varying size and shape over the green, and faint subcrustal\r\nlavender blotches showing through.\" Other eggs which I have seen figured\r\nor described would fit these descriptions fairly well. The measurements\r\nof 42 eggs average 43.1 by 29.6 millimeters; the eggs showing the four\r\nextremes measure =49.8= by =33.8=, =39.9= by 29.7 and 41.5 by =27.7=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation is said to be between 20 and 25 days.\r\nBoth sexes have been taken with incubation patches, so this duty is\r\ndoubtless shared by both. I quote from Doctor Ekblaw's notes again:\r\n\r\n     Though we found but two clutches of eggs, we discovered many\r\n     families of young birds. They are able to leave the nest as soon as\r\n     hatched, little gray downy chicks with faint blotches of brown, so\r\n     like the dried tufts of _dryas_ as to be quite undiscoverable when\r\n     hidden among them. Three or four, or rarely five, chicks constitute\r\n     the group. Their faint plaintive \"cheeps\" are so ventriloquistic\r\n     and illusory that it is impossible to distinguish the direction\r\n     from which they come. When an intruder approaches the little\r\n     fellows squat at the signal from the parent bird wherever they\r\n     happen to be at the time, and remain immovable as the pebbles and\r\n     tufts of _dryas_ until the danger is over, even though it be hours\r\n     before the safety seems assured. Even the tiniest of these downy\r\n     fledglings seem able to look after themselves. They run eagerly and\r\n     constantly about independently pursuing the moths, crane flies, and\r\n     flies upon which they feed, often 40 or 50 feet from their mother.\r\n     The first signal from the mother, a mellow, solicitous _coo-ee_\r\n     transforms them into immovable pebbles or tufts of _dryas_. When\r\n     they are discovered and realize that their concealment is no longer\r\n     effective, they scatter panic stricken like a flock of little\r\n     chickens, chirping appealingly to their \"mother\" who dashes\r\n     valiantly to their defense, quite beside \"herself\" with concern,\r\n     fear, and anger.\r\n\r\n     Whenever the jaegers, relentless brigands of birdland, appear, the\r\n     old knots do not hesitate to attack. In combining their forces,\r\n     they drive full into the bigger birds, striking them from beneath\r\n     again and again, until they chase them away. The young grow fast.\r\n     In three weeks after hatching they are almost full grown and\r\n     half-clothed in feathers, quite capable of taking care of\r\n     themselves. They stay until they leave among the interior plains\r\n     and plateaus, coming down to shore only when they are able to\r\n     fly--and then the southward migration begins at once.\r\n\r\n     Apparently, the knots, like the phalaropes, reverse part of their\r\n     secondary sex characteristics, for all the birds caring for the\r\n     young that I collected were males, beyond doubt. When I examined\r\n     the first bird that I collected with its young, I was surprised to\r\n     find that the supposed \"mother,\" who had so valiantly and zealously\r\n     shielded \"her\" little ones, was actually father. I thought then\r\n     that perhaps the mother bird had been killed and that in the\r\n     emergency the father had assumed the responsibility for the\r\n     youngsters; but later I became convinced by examination of many\r\n     birds, that invariably it is the male that cares for the fledglings\r\n     after they are hatched. The female incubates the eggs, but the male\r\n     relieves her of further care in bringing up the family.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--In its natal down the young knot can be easily recognized\r\nby the grayish, mottled colors on the upper parts and the absence of\r\nbrowns and bright buffs. The shape of the bill, characteristic of the\r\nspecies, is also diagnostic. The crown, back, rump, wings, and thighs\r\nare finely mottled or spotted with black, white, gray and dull \"cinnamon\r\nbuff,\" the last being the basal color. The forehead, the sides of the\r\nhead, the throat, and the entire under parts are dull white, tinged with\r\ngrayish on the flanks and crissum. There is a broad median stripe on the\r\nforehead, a broad loral stripe from the bill to the eye and a narrower\r\nrictal stripe of black.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage appears first on the wings, scapulars, and sides of\r\nthe breast; the primaries burst their sheaths before the young bird is\r\nhalf grown. In the juvenal plumage, as seen on migration in August, the\r\ncrown is heavily streaked with blackish brown, the feathers being edged\r\nwith light buff; the feathers of the back and scapulars have an outer\r\nborder of light buff, then a black border, then another buff, and\r\nsometimes a faint black border inside of that; the greater and median\r\nwing coverts have a terminal buff and a subterminal black border; the\r\ntail feathers are edged with buff and the under parts are more or less\r\nsuffused with pale buff. Probably the buff is brighter and deeper in\r\nfresh plumage and it fades out to white before this plumage is molted.\r\n\r\nA postjuvenal molt takes place, between September and December, of the\r\nbody plumage, some scapulars and some wing coverts. This produces the\r\nfirst winter plumage, which is like that of the adult, except for the\r\nretained juvenal scapulars and wing coverts. I have seen birds in this\r\nplumage as early as September 30. A partial prenuptial molt, similar to\r\nthat of the adult, produces during the spring a first nuptial plumage in\r\nwhich young birds can be distinguished from adults by varying amounts of\r\nretained winter feathers. At the next complete molt, the first\r\npostnuptial young birds assume the fully adult winter plumage.\r\n\r\nAdults have a partial prenuptial molt between February and June,\r\ninvolving most of the body plumage, but not all of the scapulars, wing\r\ncoverts, and tertials. There is much individual variation in the time of\r\nthis molt. I have seen birds in full nuptial plumage as early as March\r\n21 and in full winter plumage as late as May 13. The complete\r\npostnuptial molt begins in July with the body molt, which is usually\r\ncompleted before October. I have seen adults in full nuptial plumage as\r\nlate as September 6. The red-breasted birds reported by Mr. Mackay\r\n(1893) as shot on Cape Cod in December and February must have been\r\nexceptional cases of delayed or omitted molt; the February birds may\r\nhave been cases of early spring molt.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Doctor Ekblaw says:\r\n\r\n     Their food when they first come to the North is scarce, and when\r\n     the weather is unduly unfavorable they are hard put to it to find\r\n     enough to live. They probe about the grasses and sedges on the wet\r\n     moors and along the swales and pools, and sometimes wade breast\r\n     deep into the water to pick out the small but abundant life that\r\n     swarms in some of the pools, mostly crustacea and larvae. The upper\r\n     mandible is relatively soft and pliant. Sometimes they search the\r\n     tide pools left at low water, or poke about the rocks and gravel\r\n     along shore.\r\n\r\nOther Arctic explorers have referred to the scanty food of the knot in\r\nthe north; H. Chichester Hart (1880) says that \"of a number of knots'\r\nstomachs examined, only one contained any food; this consisted of two\r\ncaterpillars, one bee, and pieces of an Alga;\" Colonel Feilden (1879)\r\nsaw knots \"feeding eagerly on the buds of _Saxifraga oppositifolia_;\"\r\nMr. Manniche (1910) \"saw them running on the snow eagerly occupied in\r\npicking up the seed of _Carex_ and _Lazula_ tufts, the ends of which\r\nhere and there appeared over the snow.\" Later on, when the ponds and\r\nmarshes are teeming with animal life, they have plenty of food.\r\n\r\nWith us, on migrations, the knots feed mainly on the sandy and stony\r\nbeaches, moving deliberately along in compact groups close to the\r\nwater's edge, probing in the sand for minute mollusks and small\r\ncrustaceans. On the sandy beaches on the west coast of Florida, the wet\r\nsand is filled with minute shellfish known as _Coquinas_, on which the\r\nknots seemed to be feeding. They also feed to some extent on the mud\r\nflats and sand flats with the black-bellied plover, where they find\r\nmarine insects and their larvae. Mr. Mackay (1893) says \"they also eat\r\nthe larvae of one of the cutworms (Noctuidae) which they obtain on the\r\nmarshes,\" some of which he has found in their throats when shot. Edward\r\nH. Forbush (1912) says: \"They are fond of the spawn of the horsefoot\r\ncrab, which, often in company with the turnstone, they dig out of the\r\nsand, sometimes fighting the former birds before they can claim their\r\nshare.\" W. L. McAtee (1911) says that they also feed on grasshoppers and\r\non marine worms of the genus _Nereis_.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The knots fly swiftly in compact flocks, twisting and\r\nturning in unison like the smaller sandpipers, for which they might\r\neasily be mistaken at a distance. On the ground they are rather\r\ndeliberate in their movements, generally grouped in compact bunches and\r\nall moving along together; they are less likely to scatter over their\r\nfeeding grounds than other waders. When resting on the high beaches\r\nbetween tides they stand quietly in close groups, all facing the wind;\r\ntheir grey plumage renders them quite inconspicuous at such times. F. H.\r\nAllen tells me that he has seen half a dozen of them hopping about on\r\none leg in shallow water; this may be a sort of game, frequently\r\nindulged in by many small waders.\r\n\r\nMr. Manniche (1910) says:\r\n\r\n     Peculiar to this species is its restless character. The resident\r\n     couples would every day make long excursions, not only to seek\r\n     food, but probably also for pleasure. Their great power of flight\r\n     makes them able to do this without difficulty. In rapid high flight\r\n     they are now here and now there. I often saw them set out in a\r\n     northern direction high over the summits of the mountains or in a\r\n     southern far out over the ice in the firths, to return after a\r\n     short while.\r\n\r\n     In the breeding season the male is pugnacious and quarrelsome\r\n     against birds of its own kin as well as against other small birds,\r\n     which appear within his domain. Uttering a short cry he will fly\r\n     up and pursue the intruder in the most violent manner and often he\r\n     would follow it so far away, that I could not see them, even\r\n     through my field glass. He would soon return, and\r\n     having--triumphantly fluting--circled around several times, go\r\n     down to his mate. I have seen the knot pursue even skuas.\r\n\r\nMr. Mackay (1893) writes:\r\n\r\n     On the ground they are sluggish and not given to moving about much;\r\n     unless very much harassed they are not nearly so vigilant as their\r\n     companions, the black-bellied plover, but when they have become shy\r\n     they are exceedingly wary and always on the alert for danger. When\r\n     the incoming tide drives the knots from the flats they seek the\r\n     marshes or some shoal which is sufficiently elevated to remain\r\n     uncovered during high water; they also frequent the crest of the\r\n     beaches. Here they generally remain quiet until the tide has fallen\r\n     sufficiently to permit them to return again to the flats to feed.\r\n     When on the marshes during high water they occupy some of the time\r\n     in feeding, showing they are by no means dependent on the flats for\r\n     all their food. They associate and mingle freely with the turnstone\r\n     (_Arenaria interpres_), black-bellied plover (_Charadrius\r\n     squatarola_), and red-backed sandpiper (_Tringa alpina pacifica_)\r\n     as with their own kind, and apparently evince the same friendship\r\n     toward the two former birds as prevails between the American golden\r\n     plover (_Charadrius dominicus_) and the Eskimo curlew (_Numenius\r\n     borealis_). I have heard of but one instance (at Revere, Mass.,\r\n     during a storm) of the knot being noted in the same flock with\r\n     adult American golden plover. At this time there were three, one of\r\n     which was shot. I have heard, however, of both adult and young\r\n     knots mingling with young American golden plover, or\r\n     \"pale-bellies,\" as they are locally called.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The same writer says:\r\n\r\n     They make two notes. One is soft, of two articulations, and sounds\r\n     like the word \"Wah-quoit\" (by which name it is sometimes known on\r\n     Cape Cod); although uttered low, it can be heard quite a distance.\r\n     This note is particularly noticeable when flocks are coming to the\r\n     decoys; it has a faint rolling sound similar to the note of the\r\n     American golden plover (_Charadrius dominicus_) under the same\r\n     conditions, only more subdued and faint. The other is a single note\r\n     resembling a little honk. These birds will also respond to the note\r\n     of the black-bellied plover (_Charadrius squatarola_) as readily as\r\n     to their own when it is given with a whistle.\r\n\r\nRoland C. Ross (1924) gives the following graphic description of the\r\ncroaking note:\r\n\r\n     The common call is a low-pitched, hoarse \"skeuk,\" the lowest and\r\n     heaviest voice on the flats. It struck me as a dull croak, coming\r\n     pretty regularly from the feeding birds, and especially strong when\r\n     they took wing. A lone bird in joining the flock would croak his\r\n     coming. The sound can be imitated in quality and form but in a\r\n     higher pitch. Make the facial contortions necessary to \"cluck\" to a\r\n     horse, but don't \"cluck\"; make it \"skeuk,\" and locate it in the\r\n     wisdom teeth on the side being dislocated. Pitch it low; it will\r\n     still be two tones too high. At a distance the sucking or harsh\r\n     quality is lost. A softer, more musical rendition is given when the\r\n     birds are well bunched and feeding, which came to my ear as\r\n     \"chook.\"\r\n\r\nJohn T. Nichols (1920) says: \"The flight note of the knot is a\r\nlow-pitched whistle, frequently in two parts, with a peculiar lisp or\r\nbuzz in it, _tlu tlu_.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Ekblaw describes the notes heard on the breeding grounds as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Four distinct calls characterize the mating and nesting season.\r\n     Most common are two piercingly shrill calls uttered generally on\r\n     the wing, one of them resembling _wah-quoi_ and the other\r\n     _wee-a-whit_, easily distinguished, but somewhat alike. The\r\n     long-drawn-out _coo-a-hee_, or _coo-hee_, is a soft, flutelike call\r\n     also given in flight, but nearly always back among the hills, far\r\n     from the shore where the nests are hidden. This flutelike call\r\n     appears to be a signal or recognition call. The fourth call is a\r\n     sharp, querulous _whit_, _whit_, _whit_, almost like a cluck, often\r\n     given singly, but more often many times repeated. When their\r\n     nesting haunts are invaded or their feeding grounds disturbed this\r\n     call expresses their displeasure.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--In spring plumage the knot is easily recognized by its\r\nreddish breast, which, however, is not as conspicuous as might be\r\nexpected. In immature and winter plumage the best character is the\r\nabsence of any conspicuous field mark. Even in flight it seems to be a\r\nplain gray bird; the rump and tail appear but little lighter than the\r\nrest of the upper parts and the faint white line in the wings is hardly\r\nnoticeable. Its larger size will hardly distinguish it from the smaller\r\nsandpipers except by direct comparison. Its short, greenish yellow legs\r\nand its prominent bill might help one to recognize it under favorable\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Doctor Ekblaw says:\r\n\r\n     As soon as the water begins to grow cold, when insect and other\r\n     small life becomes scarce, and when the midnight sun approaches the\r\n     horizon, the knots abandon the northland, plump and strong from\r\n     their summer stay in the Arctic, and wend their way to the\r\n     southland. Not even a belated straggler can be found after August\r\n     1.\r\n\r\nThe adults begin to arrive on Cape Cod about the middle of July; the\r\nheight of their abundance comes about the first week in August and most\r\nof them disappear during that month, although Mr. Mackay (1893) has\r\nrecorded them in October, December, and February. The young birds begin\r\nto arrive there about August 20, but the main flight of \"graybacks,\" as\r\nthe young are called on this coast, comes along in September and early\r\nOctober, stragglers sometimes lingering into November. When with us,\r\nknots frequent the beaches; although they are found on both sandy and\r\nstony beaches, I have sometimes thought that they preferred the pebbly\r\nbeaches, feeding close to the water line, where they are often\r\nsurprisingly invisible among the variously colored stones. They are not\r\nshy, as a rule, and generally allow a close approach before they fly off\r\nswiftly, uttering their characteristic notes. At high tide, when their\r\nfeeding grounds are covered, they resort to the high beaches to rest,\r\npreen their plumage, and sleep.\r\n\r\nBy July 20 the first birds have reached South Carolina, where some\r\nremain until October 15. We saw what was probably the last of the\r\nmigration on the west coast of Florida in 1924. The knots were there\r\nwhen we arrived on November 11. During a northerly gale and after a\r\nheavy rain on the 21st I saw several small flocks on the high and dry\r\nsand of an exposed beach, huddled together in compact bunches and\r\nreluctant to move. The last birds were seen on the 26th.\r\n\r\nIn the interior the knot seems to be even rarer in the fall than in the\r\nspring, but on the Pacific coast the reverse seems to be the case. It is\r\nregarded as rather rare in Alaska, but F. S. Hersey collected a small\r\nseries for me at St. Michael on August 4 and 8, 1915, and H. B. Conover\r\ntook two at Golovin Bay on August 14, 1924. D. E. Brown's notes record\r\nthem at Grays Harbor, Washington, from August 21 to November 2, 1917.\r\n\r\n_Game._--Although no longer on the game-bird list, the knot is a good\r\ngame bird. It flies in compact flocks, comes well to the decoys when\r\nattracted by the whistle of an experienced caller, flies rather swiftly,\r\nand makes a good table bird, for it is of good size and usually fat. It\r\nwas always included in the list of what we used to call \"big birds.\" On\r\nCape Cod knots in all plumages are called \"redbreasts\" by the gunners,\r\nthough the name \"grayback\" is often applied to the young birds. Mr.\r\nMackay (1893) says:\r\n\r\n     When shy and coming to decoys to alight, they barely touch their\r\n     feet to the sand before they discover their mistake and are off in\r\n     an instant. They fly quickly and closely together and, when coming\r\n     to decoys, usually pass by them down wind, most of the flock\r\n     whistling, then suddenly wheeling with heads to the wind, and up to\r\n     the decoys. At such times many are killed at one discharge.\r\n\r\nDr. L. C. Sanford (1903) writes:\r\n\r\n     One of my pleasant recollections of shore-bird shooting is\r\n     associated with this bird. I give the date with some hesitation,\r\n     for it was May 10, near Cobb Island. During several days previous\r\n     redbreast had been flying, but the tides were not suitable, and it\r\n     was useless to try for them. Here the flight is along the outer\r\n     beach, at the edge of the surf, the birds stopping to feed on the\r\n     mud flats exposed by the falling tide. The sun was not up and the\r\n     water still high as we set the decoys off one of the points along\r\n     the beach, close to the breaking waves; the blind was of seaweed,\r\n     and before we were settled the first flock passed by high up, but a\r\n     pair of birds dropped out of it and hovered in front of us; another\r\n     minute and 10 more swung in. Flock after flock, from a few birds to\r\n     hundreds, passed in the same line, coming into sight over the\r\n     ocean, striking the beach and following its edge--now low just over\r\n     the surf, now high up--the first light of sunrise giving them a\r\n     black appearance. The undulating character of the flight was\r\n     unmistakable and was in evidence when the dark line first\r\n     appeared--now distinct on the horizon, presently out of sight in\r\n     the waves, all of a sudden rising up over the decoys to circle in.\r\n     Our chance lasted only a few minutes, for when the flat was exposed\r\n     the birds all passed by out of range; occasionally we whistled in\r\n     an odd one, but the flocks shied off. As we carried back our basket\r\n     of birds it did not occur to us that the experience of that morning\r\n     would be our last flight of redbreast, but it was.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The breeding range of the knot in North America is\r\nimperfectly known, but appears to extend north to Franklin (Winter\r\nHarbor, Victoria Land, and Goose Fiord), and Grinnell Land (Fort\r\nConger).

Bailey (1925), when he captured a single\r\nspecimen in northwestern Alaska on May 28, 1922. He says:\r\n\r\n     One specimen of this species, an adult male in light plumage, was\r\n     taken at Cape Prince of Wales on May 28. At this date the tundra\r\n     was still covered with snow, but the higher benches of the cape\r\n     were becoming bare. The first arrivals of many species were just\r\n     making their appearance, using these high exposed spots as resting\r\n     places. Among these numerous migrants I took this one straggler. It\r\n     was so tame I collected it with my .32 aux.\r\n\r\nIt is larger than our knot and is also known as the Japanese knot.\r\nSeebohm (1888) says:\r\n\r\n     It is the only _Tringa_ with white on the upper tail coverts which\r\n     has a straight bill more than an inch and a half long. In summer\r\n     plumage it has no chestnut on the under parts, and the chestnut on\r\n     the upper parts is principally confined to the scapulars. In winter\r\n     plumage the two knots scarcely differ except in size. It is very\r\n     closely allied to the common knot.\r\n\r\n     The breeding grounds of the Japanese knot are unknown, but\r\n     Middendorff observed it during the whole summer on the southern\r\n     shores of the Sea of Okhotsk, though he obtained no evidence of\r\n     its nesting there. It has occurred on migration in the valley of\r\n     the Ussuri, on the coasts of Japan and China, and on most of the\r\n     islands of the Malay Archipelago. It winters on the coast of\r\n     Australia, has occurred on the Andaman Islands, and in\r\n     considerable numbers on the coast of Scinde.\r\n\r\n\r\nARQUATELLA MARITIMA (Brünnich)\r\n\r\nPURPLE SANDPIPER\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThis hardy northern bird has well been called \"winter snipe\" and \"rock\r\nsnipe,\" for it is known to us only as a winter visitor on rocky shores.\r\nAlthough it does not breed quite as far north as some species, it\r\nmigrates for a shorter distance and winters farther north than any other\r\nwader; in fact, the southern limit of its winter range is far north of\r\nthe normal winter range of any other. A. L. V. Manniche (1910) saw only\r\nthree purple sandpipers during three seasons in northeastern Greenland,\r\nand the Crockerland expedition saw only one in northwestern Greenland in\r\nfour years. Both expeditions were probably north of its normal breeding\r\nrange.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--As soon as spring asserts itself the purple sandpipers begin\r\nto desert their main winter range on the coast of New England, some\r\nleaving in March and only a very few stragglers lingering into May. On\r\nMay 29, 1909, we saw a few late migrants on the south coast of Labrador,\r\nwhere I secured one in full nuptial plumage. Ludwig Kumlien (1879) says\r\nthat the purple sandpiper is the first wader to arrive in the spring at\r\nCumberland Sound.\r\n\r\n     The 4th of June Is the earliest date I met them at Annanactook;\r\n     this was during a heavy snowstorm, and the earliest date possible\r\n     that they could have found any of the rocks bare at low tide. The\r\n     flock lit on the top of one of the small islands in the harbor and\r\n     sheltered themselves from the storm by creeping behind and\r\n     underneath ledges of rocks; they then huddled together like a flock\r\n     of quails in winter. I have often noticed the same habit with them\r\n     in late autumn, while they were waiting for low tide.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--The same writer refers to a courtship performance, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     As the breeding season approaches the males have a peculiar cry,\r\n     resembling somewhat that of _Actiturus bartramius_, but lower and\r\n     not so prolonged. When this note is uttered they assume a very\r\n     dignified strut, and often raise the wings up over the back and\r\n     slowly fold them again, like the upland plover.\r\n\r\nAubyn Trevor-Battye (1897) says:\r\n\r\n     Like all sandpipers, they do much of their courtship on the wing,\r\n     chasing one another in circles with rapid turns and shifts. On the\r\n     ground I have seen the male bird approach the female with trailing\r\n     wings, arched back, and head low down, occasionally hopping, like a\r\n     courting pigeon.\r\n\r\nThis species seems to be rather rare in Baffin Land. I have two sets of\r\neggs, given to me by Capt. Donald B. MacMillan, collected with the\r\nparent bird at Cape Dorset. J. Dewey Soper collected a female there,\r\nwith enlarged ovaries, on June 8; but he saw only three birds during\r\n\"the spring and summer of 1926 along the south coast of Baffin Island.\"\r\nHe says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     The first sandpiper observed by me the following spring was of this\r\n     species, a solitary male collected on June 2, 1925, at Nettilling\r\n     Lake. The lakes were still ice-bound and the land mostly covered\r\n     with snow, but here and there were small open pools. Along the\r\n     border of one of these the bird was feeding in the thin layer of\r\n     thawed mud among the grassy hummocks. On June 11, in the same\r\n     locality near the Takuirbing River, several were observed and\r\n     collected. When flushed they emit a grating _ick-ick-ick_ and when\r\n     not too hard pressed will often light again a few yards away. They\r\n     flush sluggishly, and when not come upon too abruptly will\r\n     frequently elevate the wings leisurely above the back, as though\r\n     stretching them before taking flight. On the whole, at this time,\r\n     they were comparatively fearless and permitted close approach. Only\r\n     one was observed giving a vocal performance on the wing. It rose\r\n     slowly from the ground to a height of 15 or 20 feet and leisurely\r\n     flying over the tundra gave a series of low, musical staccato notes\r\n     resembling _to-wit-to-wit-to-wit-to-wit_, etc. The performance\r\n     continues unbrokenly while the bird remains in the air over a\r\n     distance of 25 or 30 yards.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Rev. Henry H. Slater (1898) says:\r\n\r\n     In the extreme north the nest is often quite close to the sea,\r\n     little above high-water mark. But in Iceland and at the southern\r\n     borders of its breeding range generally the purple sandpiper\r\n     usually nests on the fells. My first nest, from which I shot the\r\n     female mentioned above, was near the top of a high ridge in north\r\n     Iceland, nearly 1,600 feet above sea level, on a small bare patch\r\n     of recently uncovered ground amongst snow fields; it was a slight\r\n     hollow in a withered tuft of _Dryas octopetala_, and rather a\r\n     substantial nest for a wader, consisting of a good handful of\r\n     leaves of _Dryas_ and _Salix lanata_, a little short grass, two\r\n     white ptarmigan's feathers and a few of the parents'.\r\n\r\nW. C. Hewitson (1856) quotes Mr. Wolley as saying that in the Faeroes,\r\n\"it breeds sparingly on the very tops of high mountains, where I found\r\nits young at the end of June still unable to fly.\"\r\n\r\nMessrs. E. Evans and W. Sturge (1859) found the purple sandpiper\r\nbreeding in Spitsbergen; they say:\r\n\r\n     The purple sandpiper (_Tringa maritina_, Brünn.) was very abundant\r\n     in Coal Bay (on the south side of Ice Sound, so named on account of\r\n     a small quantity of poor coal being found there), and we found four\r\n     of their nests on the high field. Beautiful little nests they were,\r\n     deep in the ground, and lined with stalks of grass and leaves of\r\n     the dwarf birch (_Betula nana_, L.), containing mostly four eggs of\r\n     an olive green, handsomely mottled with purplish brown, chiefly at\r\n     the larger end. We watched this elegant little bird--the only one\r\n     of the _Grallatores_ we saw--with much interest as it waded into\r\n     some pool of snow water or ran along the shingle, every now and\r\n     then raising its wings over its back and exhibiting the delicate\r\n     tint of the under side, at the same time uttering its loud shrill\r\n     whistle.\r\n\r\nNo recent accounts of the nesting habits of this species seem to have\r\nbeen published and the data on eggs in collections seem to be rather\r\nscanty. I have never found a nest myself. Both sexes are said to\r\nincubate the eggs and share in the care of the young. The period of\r\nincubation is over 20 days.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--A very good description of the eggs is given by Seebohm (1884)\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     The eggs of the purple sandpiper are four in number and remarkably\r\n     handsome. They vary in ground color from pale olive to pale buffish\r\n     brown, boldly mottled, blotched, and streaked with reddish brown\r\n     and very dark blackish brown. On some eggs the blotches are large,\r\n     and chiefly distributed in an oblique direction round the large\r\n     end; on others they are more evenly distributed over the entire\r\n     surface; and on many a few very dark scratches, spots, or streaks\r\n     are scattered here and there amongst the brown markings. The\r\n     underlying markings are numerous and conspicuous, and are pale\r\n     violet gray or grayish brown in color.\r\n\r\nFrank Poynting's (1895) colored plate of 12 selected eggs well\r\nillustrates the great variation in the beautiful eggs of this species.\r\nThere are two distinct types of ground color, green and buff. In the\r\ngreen types the colors vary from \"yellowish glaucous\" to a light shade\r\nof \"grape green\"; and in the buff types from \"cream buff\" to \"dark olive\r\nbuff.\" They are sometimes evenly, but more often irregularly, spotted\r\nand blotched with various shades of brown, \"sepia,\" \"bister,\" and \"snuff\r\nbrown,\" sometimes boldly marked with \"chocolate\" and \"burnt umber\" and\r\nsometimes with great splashes of \"vinaceous brown\" overlaid with\r\nblotches of \"chestnut brown\" and \"bay,\" a handsome combination. The\r\nmeasurements of 100 eggs, supplied by Rev. F. C. R. Jourdain, average\r\n37.3 by 26.5 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure\r\n=40= by =28=, =35.1= by 26.6 and 37.3 by =24.8= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The nestling is described in Witherby's Handbook (1920) as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Fore part of crown warm buff; black-brown median line from base of\r\n     upper mandible to crown; crown and upper parts velvety black-brown,\r\n     down with numerous cream and warm buff tips; nape light buff, down\r\n     with sooty-brown bases; from base of upper mandible above eye to\r\n     nape a black-brown streak, another short one from base of lower\r\n     mandible, ear coverts as crown; cheeks warm or light buff, down\r\n     with black-brown tips; remaining under parts grayish white, down\r\n     sooty brown toward base.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage is much like that of the summer adult, except that\r\nthe feathers of the crown are tipped with creamy white, as are also the\r\ncentral tail feathers; the feathers of the mantle and scapulars are\r\nedged with buffy white; and the wing coverts and tertials are broadly\r\nedged with the same color or tipped with pale pinkish buff. The juvenal\r\nbody plumage is usually molted before the birds reach us on migration,\r\nwhen young birds, in first winter plumage, can be recognized by the\r\nbroad white edgings of the median coverts and by a few retained\r\nscapulars and tertials. Some of these juvenal feathers are retained\r\nthrough the next, the partial prenuptial molt. Subsequent molts and\r\nplumages are as in the adult.\r\n\r\nAdults have a complete postnuptial molt between August and November and\r\na partial prenuptial molt from January to May; this latter involves most\r\nof the body plumage, but not all of the scapulars, back, rump, or upper\r\ntail coverts.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The favorite feeding places of purple sandpipers are the\r\nwave-washed rocky shores of islands or promontories along the seashore,\r\nwith a decided preference for islands. Here, where the rocks are fringed\r\nwith rockweed, waving in the restless waves, or covered with barnacles\r\nand various slimy products of the sea, these sure-footed little birds\r\nare quite at home on the slippery rocks, as they glean abundant food at\r\nthe water's edge and skillfully avoid being washed away. Yarrell (1871)\r\nsays that--\r\n\r\n     it may be seen busily employed turning over stones and searching\r\n     among seaweed for the smaller shrimps and sandhoppers which are to\r\n     be found there, and it also feeds on young crabs, marine insects,\r\n     and the soft bodies of animals inhabiting small shells.\r\n\r\nWitherby's Handbook (1920) gives its food as--\r\n\r\n     varied, including insects: coleoptera (_Otiorhynchus_), diptera\r\n     (larvae of _Chironomus_), also spiders, _Thysanura_ (or\r\n     _Collembola_), annelida and crustacea (_Amphipoda_, _Isopoda_,\r\n     _Orchestia_, _Idotea_, _Gammarus_, and _Podocerus_) as well as\r\n     mollusca (_Mytilus_, _Littorina_, _Purpura_, etc.). Vegetable\r\n     matter is also eaten including algae, grasses, moss, buds, and\r\n     leaves of phanerogams and remains of cryptogams. Seeds of\r\n     _Cochlearia_ have been identified and small fish (_Gobius_) nearly\r\n     1 inch long, as well as ova of lumpsucker.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The flight of the purple sandpiper suggests at times that\r\nof the spotted sandpiper, for when disturbed singly along the shore it\r\nis apt to fly out over the water with rapid downward wing strokes and,\r\ndescribing a large semicircle, return to the shore some distance ahead.\r\nWhen flying in a flock the birds are often closely bunched, the whole\r\nflock wheeling and turning in unison, showing alternately their dark\r\nbodies and their white bellies, in true sandpiper fashion. As a rule\r\nthey do not make very long flights or fly very high. Their migrations\r\nare short and deliberate. They are rather sedentary birds and can\r\ngenerally be found in certain favorite localities all winter and year\r\nafter year. But, as they show a decided preference for the outer sides\r\nof surf-swept ledges, they are not often seen from the land. They can\r\nswim almost as well as phalaropes and in calm weather they will often\r\nalight on half submerged seaweed or on the surface of the water. Dr.\r\nCharles W. Townsend (1905), who watched a flock on an island off Cape\r\nAnn, describes their actions as follows:\r\n\r\n     They finally alighted on a steeply sloping rock close to the\r\n     water's edge on the northeastern point of the island so that they\r\n     could be watched with binoculars and telescope from the shore.\r\n     Fifty-eight birds were in sight and there were fully half as many\r\n     more on the other side of the rock, hidden from view, except when\r\n     they jumped up from time to time. The flock must have numbered 75.\r\n     The tide was high and the birds were evidently trying to kill time\r\n     until low water, when they could gather their food from the seaweed\r\n     covered rocks. Most of them were resting, squatting on the rock\r\n     with head to the wind, their dark purplish-gray backs contrasting\r\n     strongly with their white bellies. Others were slowly raising their\r\n     wings over their backs, showing the white under surfaces. Again\r\n     they were chasing each other, making the sleepy ones jump suddenly,\r\n     or running up the rock to escape an unusually high wave, fluttering\r\n     with their wings to help themselves. From time to time they were\r\n     joined by bunches of from 5 to 10 others.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--This species is a rather silent bird, but John T. Nichols says\r\nin his notes: \"When about to take wing a flock of purple sandpipers is\r\nrather noisy, keeping up a swallowlike chatter, each single-syllabled\r\nnote suggestive of the _flip_ of the tree swallow and of the _kip_ of\r\nthe sanderling.\"\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--A sandpiper seen on a rocky shore in New England in\r\nwinter is likely to be a purple sandpiper. Mr. Nichols suggests the\r\nfollowing field characters:\r\n\r\n     The purple sandpiper is a stockily built bird, which stands low and\r\n     has a moderately long bill. Its breast and upper parts of a dark\r\n     purplish gray match admirably the rocks on which it lives, and\r\n     although darker are not very different in tone from the coloring of\r\n     the red-backed sandpiper in fall, with which species it might\r\n     possibly be confused. Both have a white line in the wing shown in\r\n     flight, but in the purple sandpiper this broadens to a more\r\n     conspicuous wedge of white backward on the inner secondaries and\r\n     extends across the bases of the primaries as narrow edging to their\r\n     coverts, rather than turning the bend of the wing into the\r\n     primaries. The best field character is the color of legs and feet,\r\n     which are of a dull but strong yellow, appreciable at a\r\n     considerable distance. The basal third of the bill is of the same,\r\n     but tinged with orange.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--The fall migration of the purple sandpiper is a gradual\r\nsouthward movement along the Atlantic coast. It disappears from its\r\nbreeding grounds early in September, but the main flight does not reach\r\nNew England until November or December. What few stragglers have been\r\nseen on the Great Lakes were probably migrants from Hudson Bay. E. W.\r\nHadeler writes to me that he observed one on the shore of Lake Erie,\r\nPainesville, Ohio, from October 22 to November 12, 1916, and again from\r\nOctober 24 to November 11, 1922. It is interesting to note the\r\nuniformity of the dates and the fact that the species was seen always on\r\na stone breakwater, apparently feeding exclusively on the water-washed\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--The purple sandpiper is the \"winter snipe\" of the New England\r\ncoast, where flocks of from 25 to 75 or more may be found regularly on\r\ncertain outlying rocky ledges. Here they seek shelter among the rocks\r\nfrom the flying spray and from the wintry blasts; and here they find\r\ntheir food washed up by the waves or hidden in the half floating beds of\r\nrockweed. On December 10, 1913, while we were shooting eiders on one of\r\nthe outer ledges in Jericho Bay, Maine, a flock of about 50 of these\r\nhardy little birds seemed out of place in our rough surroundings. It was\r\na cold, blustering day; the surf was breaking over the rocks and the sea\r\nwas white with combing breakers; even the hardy sea ducks sought the\r\nshelter of the ledges; but these plump little birds seemed quite happy\r\nand contented as they huddled together in a compact flock on the\r\nslippery rocks. They were very tame and confiding; even the reports of\r\nour guns served only to make them circle out around the ledge a few\r\ntimes and then return to its shelter. Evidently this was their winter\r\nhome. We did not have the heart to shoot any of them.\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols tells me that \"very occasionally in winter, early spring or\r\nlate fall, one finds single birds on the sandy beaches of New York or\r\nNew Jersey south of the rocks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Europe, Asia, and northeastern North America.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--In the Old World the purple sandpiper breeds in the\r\nArctic regions from Iceland, Norway, and Spitsbergen east to Nova Zembla\r\nand the Taimyr Peninsula. In North America the breeding range extends\r\nnorth to Franklin (Igloolik); and Greenland (Hare Island, and Shannon\r\nIslands). East to Greenland (Shannon Islands and Ivimiut). South to\r\nGreenland (Ivimiut and Ivigtut); and Franklin (southern Baffin Island,\r\nCumberland Sound, and Winter Island). West to Franklin (Winter Island\r\nand Igloolik). It has been detected in summer still farther north;\r\nFranklin (Mercy Bay, Fury Point, Boothia Felix, and Possession Bay); and\r\nGreenland (Bowdoin Bay, Thank God Harbor, North Star Bay, and Fort\r\nConger).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The purple sandpiper winters farther north than any\r\nother shore bird.

I have therefore thought it\r\nbest to follow Ridgway (1919) in the use of his names for the Pribilof\r\nand Aleutian sandpipers, rather than use the Check List names.\r\n\r\nThe Pribilof sandpiper has the most restricted distribution of any North\r\nAmerican sandpiper. In summer it is confined to the chilly and foggy\r\nuplands of the Pribilof Islands, the equally cool, damp lowlands of St.\r\nMatthew Island, Hall Island, and perhaps St. Lawrence Island, all in\r\nBering Sea. And its known migration range is limited to a few\r\nlocalities on the mainland of Alaska and in the Aleutian Islands, where\r\nit probably winters. It may breed more extensively on St. Lawrence\r\nIsland than it is now known to do, but it has not yet been found\r\nbreeding anywhere on the mainland. G. Dallas Hanna (1921) says:\r\n\r\n     I strongly suspect that the birds have some other extensive\r\n     breeding ground than St. George, St. Paul, and St. Matthew Islands,\r\n     because in September and October large flocks come to the two\r\n     former islands; these appear to contain many more individuals than\r\n     are in existence on all three. Whether St. Lawrence Island supplies\r\n     the extra number or not remains for future determination. The\r\n     winter range of the species is practically unknown, the only\r\n     records being from Portage Bay, southeast Alaska, and Lynn Canal,\r\n     between Alaska and British Columbia. The appearance of the birds at\r\n     the former locality in flocks in spring (if identifications were\r\n     correct) indicates that they wintered farther south, probably on\r\n     Vancouver and other islands of British Columbia. They could hardly\r\n     have come from beyond these localities and have remained\r\n     undiscovered.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The same writer says:\r\n\r\n     Spring migration takes place the latter part of April and the first\r\n     half of May. My earliest record for St. Paul Island is April 15\r\n     (1915) when a flock appeared at Northeast Point. The height of\r\n     migration is a little later than that date and may usually be\r\n     expected from the 1st to the 15th of May. Birds are almost\r\n     invariably paired upon arrival. Very few spring flocks have been\r\n     seen on the Pribilofs, and they do not tarry by the beaches, but go\r\n     directly to the upland nesting sites. It seems to be uncommon for\r\n     more than the resident population to land upon an island in spring.\r\n     The birds seem to go directly to the chosen breeding grounds,\r\n     wherever they may be. This fact is of wide application among the\r\n     northern shore birds. Only rare stragglers of such species as\r\n     golden plovers, turnstones, and pectoral and sharp-tailed\r\n     sandpipers stop at the Pribilofs on their way north, but large\r\n     numbers of some of them come in fall.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Dr. E. W. Nelson (1887) writes:\r\n\r\n     The male of the pair seen by me on St. Lawrence Island in June kept\r\n     flying up some 10 or 15 yards, its wings beating with a rapid\r\n     vibrating or tremulous motion, while the bird thus poised trilled\r\n     forth a clear, rather musical and liquid but hard, whistling note,\r\n     which is probably the same note which Elliott likens to the trill\r\n     of the tree frog. The short song ended, the musician glides to the\r\n     ground upon stiffened wings and resumes his feeding or stands\r\n     silently for a time on a projecting rock or knoll.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--We found Pribilof sandpipers very common in July on the low\r\ntundra at the south end of St. Matthew Island, where they were evidently\r\nbreeding just back of the beaches. They were also common in the interior\r\nat the north end of this island and on the highlands of Hall Island. We\r\ncollected a few specimens of the birds, but had no time to hunt for\r\nnests. We are indebted to Mr. Hanna (1921) for his excellent account of\r\nthe nesting habits of this bird, from which I quote as follows:\r\n\r\n     On St. George Island the high upland tundra has been chosen for\r\n     breeding ground. Here, among the reindeer \"mosses\" and light gray,\r\n     lichen-covered rocks the sandpipers reign supreme in the fog. Some\r\n     speculating may be indulged in to find a reason for so unusual a\r\n     choice of locality. Elevations up to 500 feet are sought. Perhaps\r\n     they shun the seacoasts on account of the presence there of large\r\n     numbers of foxes. During all history this has been a greater fox\r\n     island than either St. Paul or St. Matthew. On the latter island in\r\n     June and July the birds may be found in large numbers around and\r\n     back of the driftwood piles. If it were not for this fact being\r\n     known, we might suspect that on St. George the light gray tundra\r\n     was selected for protective purposes, the birds themselves being\r\n     distinguished chiefly by their light colors. St. Paul Island, for\r\n     some unaccountable reason, is not chosen as a breeding ground\r\n     except by a very few pairs. In 1919 not over a dozen were found\r\n     during the entire nesting season, when almost all of the available\r\n     areas were seen.\r\n\r\n     On the breeding grounds of St. George and St. Matthew the birds\r\n     are very common, and from one to a dozen are in almost constant\r\n     attendance upon the visitor. They sight him from afar and fly to\r\n     meet him. Some bird will almost always try to lead him astray. If\r\n     followed, it flies from knoll to knoll, often not more than 20\r\n     yards away. It remains in front of the visitor regardless of the\r\n     direction he may take; whether toward or from the nest, makes no\r\n     difference. After several minutes of this a sudden flight, with\r\n     the familiar \"song,\" is taken to some distant hill and the\r\n     searcher for a nest is left confused and confounded.\r\n\r\n     A search for the nest will exhaust the patience of any except the\r\n     most persistent collector. Messrs. Compton and Partch have been\r\n     more successful than anyone else in locating them, and all of us\r\n     agree that when a bird flies to meet the visitor, as just\r\n     described, it is a pure waste of time to watch or follow it. Every\r\n     method known to us of locating nests by watching the actions of\r\n     the parents has failed. We have located nests and then endeavored\r\n     to establish rules for guidance with others, but no definite facts\r\n     could be determined. It was finally agreed that it was useless to\r\n     watch a bird under any circumstances more than 15 minutes. If the\r\n     location of the nest is not disclosed in that time, it is safe to\r\n     assume that the mate is on it, and it might be hours before the\r\n     guard would go there. In the meantime it may fly half a mile away\r\n     and forget to come back, even to tease the hopeful collector lying\r\n     concealed in the mist and fog behind some cheerless rock. No\r\n     definite range can be ascribed to any one pair of birds, because\r\n     those off the nests mingle indiscriminately. Very often a bird\r\n     will fly completely out of the range of vision in the fog.\r\n\r\n     The action of a bird leaving a nest is unmistakable, and can\r\n     always be recognized, once it is learned. It is a quick, excited,\r\n     jerky flight, very close to the ground, and the bird goes but a\r\n     very few yards until it feigns injury in its endeavor to entice\r\n     the intruder away. It will always flutter in front of a person,\r\n     even though he walk directly toward the nest. When the bird is\r\n     seen to fly, the eggs are even more inconspicuous and difficult to\r\n     find unless the exact spot from which it flew be located. Compton\r\n     thus flushed a bird which he knew had a nest, but he was at a loss\r\n     to find it. At last he left his cane as nearly as possible where\r\n     the nest should have been and repaired to a near-by rock to watch\r\n     and wait. In a few minutes the bird returned to the eggs, which\r\n     were located about a yard from the stick. When the bird is flushed\r\n     from a nest it seldom happens that the other parent is near.\r\n\r\n     The nest is a mere depression about three and a half inches wide by\r\n     two and a half inches deep. Most of the material is removed, but it\r\n     is evidently packed down to a certain extent. No foreign material\r\n     is carried at all. The nest is usually, but not necessarily, on\r\n     some very slightly elevated ground and among the lichens called\r\n     \"reindeer moss.\" Some nests have been found where there was an\r\n     admixture of _Hypnum_ moss and again where the dwarf willows creep,\r\n     rootlike, beneath the surface.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--I can not do better than to quote again from Mr. Hanna (1921);\r\nhe writes:\r\n\r\n     The normal set of eggs consists of four. A greater number has never\r\n     been found, and a less number only when it was uncertain if the\r\n     full set had been laid. As much as three days may intervene between\r\n     egg laying, but usually the four are deposited on successive days.\r\n     When one set of eggs is taken, another will be laid. But the same\r\n     nest is not used the second time, the contentions of some natives\r\n     to the contrary notwithstanding. A set of eggs found as late as\r\n     July 24, 1917, certainly indicated that two may be laid in the same\r\n     season on rare occasions. One set is the rule.\r\n\r\n     The color of the eggs is, as would be expected, somewhat variable.\r\n     The lightest set examined in connection with this report has the\r\n     ground color \"greenish glaucous.\" From this there is perfect\r\n     gradation through \"court gray\" and \"light olive gray\" to \"deep\r\n     olive buff\" in the darkest set. Variation in any particular set is\r\n     very slight. Spots are large and bold as a rule. They vary in size\r\n     from 15 millimeters to less than one, and they are usually massed\r\n     about the larger end. In one case the eggs are uniformly spotted\r\n     with small spots all over. In none is the spotting heaviest on the\r\n     smaller end (reversed eggs). Spots are usually inclined to be\r\n     round, but occasionally they are in the form of streaks arranged\r\n     roughly in spiral form. Only rarely are they banded about the\r\n     larger end. In two cases a narrow black line was produced spirally\r\n     on the larger end. The coloration of the spots varies from \"snuff\r\n     brown\" to \"sepia\" and from \"cinnamon brown\" to \"mummy brown.\" In\r\n     some cases they are \"raw umber.\" The darkest shades occur where\r\n     the spots overlap and some deep-seated ones are \"pale aniline\r\n     lilac\" or \"pale\" to \"deep quaker drab.\" Only rarely is the outline\r\n     of a spot not sharp.\r\n\r\n     The average dimensions derived from the above series of 72 eggs\r\n     are: Length, 39.473 and breadth 27.468. Those which showed the\r\n     extreme measurements were =42.0= by 27.8; =35= by 27.4; 37.6 by\r\n     =39=, and 39.1 by =26.4.=\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation is said to be about 20 days, in which\r\nboth sexes share. William Palmer (1899) says:\r\n\r\n     The young leave the nest soon after hatching and are thoroughly\r\n     well concealed by their mimicry of the confusing mixture of mosses,\r\n     lichens, and other forms of vegetation which abounds and are so\r\n     well intermingled on these islands. It requires much patience and a\r\n     close scrutiny to detect a crouching young, even when it is\r\n     directly within reach. Obedient to their mother's cries they\r\n     flatten themselves with head and neck extended; with each yard of\r\n     the ground precisely similar in pattern and color with every other\r\n     yard, and the parents, especially the female, trying their best to\r\n     coax us in other directions, and the uncertainty as to the exact\r\n     location of the young, all combine against the collector, so that\r\n     few specimens reward a tramp that seems exasperatingly needless.\r\n     The young will not move, though one stands with the foot touching\r\n     them, but when once handled and released they scamper off with all\r\n     the quickness their long legs can give them. When we invade the\r\n     vicinity of a nest or young it is amusing to watch the antics of\r\n     the female. She invariably flies in front and flutters with feigned\r\n     lameness but a few feet away. If the ground is rough it is more\r\n     amusing to watch the precipitancy of her flight until she\r\n     disappears in a hollow, to reappear in a moment on the other side,\r\n     cautiously turning round and eying us to see if we are following.\r\n     She always keeps in front of us, no matter which way we turn, and\r\n     will continue thus for several hundred yards, when she will\r\n     suddenly fly off to some distance and after waiting awhile will\r\n     return to the vicinity of the nest or young.\r\n\r\nMr. Hanna (1921) writes:\r\n\r\n     So far as known, the food of both old and young consists of beetles\r\n     and flies while the birds remain on the highlands; when they move\r\n     to the ponds and seashores they eat copepods, amphipods, etc. As\r\n     soon as the young birds are well able to fly they resort to the\r\n     tide pools and small ponds near the sea. Later the older birds join\r\n     them and the flocks increase in size to several hundred in\r\n     favorable places. This takes place in August and September in such\r\n     localities as the Salt Lagoon of St. Paul Island.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The color pattern of the downy young Pribilof sandpiper is\r\nsimilar to that of the Aleutian, but the colors are different, much\r\nduller. The bright browns and buffs of the upper parts are replaced by\r\n\"burnt umber,\" \"snuff brown,\" \"clay color,\" and \"cinnamon buff,\" and the\r\nblack markings are largely replaced by dark browns; the black patch in\r\nthe center of the back is about as in the Aleutian. The under parts are\r\nless pure white, always suffused with pale buff on the throat and flanks\r\nand sometimes largely so on the breast also.\r\n\r\nMr. Palmer's (1899) studies of the molts and plumages indicate that they\r\nare similar to those of the Aleutian sandpiper; he writes:\r\n\r\n     The downy young are beautiful little things, silvery white beneath,\r\n     bright, rich ocherous above, variegated with black and dots of\r\n     white. The general color above lacks the grayness of the similar\r\n     age of _maritimus_. The white dots are interesting under the\r\n     microscope. They are composed of a bunch of highly specialized\r\n     down, in which the radii near the tip are crowded and colorless. As\r\n     they grow older the first feathers appear on the sides of the\r\n     breast, on the back and scapulars; then the primaries and larger\r\n     wing coverts appear. The feathering continues until the breast and\r\n     under parts are covered, when the tail appears. At this time there\r\n     are no feathers on the rump or on the head or neck. In the next\r\n     stage feathers have appeared on the occiput and on the auriculars\r\n     and are also extending up the neck. At the same time the tips of\r\n     the back feathers have become somewhat worn, so that the colored\r\n     margins are narrower and the black more prominent. The wing coverts\r\n     are also to some extent worn on their tips. When the bill is an\r\n     inch long the down has nearly all disappeared, and when it has\r\n     entirely gone the birds appear in small flocks on the beaches, the\r\n     young generally keeping together. Then another change takes place,\r\n     for the entire plumage now gives way to another, that in which the\r\n     bird passes the winter. A few late July, immature birds show the\r\n     beginning, for No. 118832, im. [male], July 29, has a few new\r\n     feathers on the middle of the back and on the scapulars. They soon\r\n     extend all over the back, so that specimens collected up to August\r\n     10 have many of the new whitish feathers on that region.\r\n\r\n     The contrast is striking between these feathers, the latest being\r\n     of an almost even shade of pale plumbean with darker centers and\r\n     generally with a narrow white margin. There are no specimens to\r\n     show the complete change, but it is probable that these young birds\r\n     remain on the islands until it is completed. By the middle of June\r\n     the adults have fully changed to the breeding plumage, but on some\r\n     specimens a few feathers of the previous winter's plumage persist\r\n     much later. Thus on many specimens some alternate feathers of the\r\n     scapulars and tertials are of the previous winter's well-worn\r\n     plumage. In fact, few specimens are free from these old feathers.\r\n     Soon after the middle of July the new plumage of the next winter\r\n     begins to appear. At first a few feathers show about the breast,\r\n     then on the scapulars, thence up the neck and over the head, so\r\n     that by the 10th of August they have changed one-half. It would\r\n     thus appear that before this species leaves the islands they assume\r\n     entirely their new dress. And at this season, August 10, old and\r\n     young flock together for the first time, and confine themselves to\r\n     the sand beaches and surf margins about the islands for a few\r\n     weeks, when they take flight by the 1st or 5th of September, and\r\n     disappear until the opening of the new season.\r\n\r\nThe Pribilof sandpiper is much paler in the juvenal plumage and grayer\r\nin the winter plumage than the Aleutian.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Preble and McAtee (1923) report on the contents of 192\r\nstomachs, as follows:\r\n\r\n     The articles of food composing more than 1 per cent of the total\r\n     were: Mollusks, 32.63 per cent; crustaceans, 29.15 per cent; flies\r\n     (Diptera), 23.49 per cent; beetles, 10.29 per cent; marine worms,\r\n     1.27 per cent; and vegetable matter, chiefly algae, 1.21 per cent.\r\n     The vegetable matter, besides algae, included bits of moss and a\r\n     few seeds of grass, lupine, violet, crowberry, and bottle brush.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Referring to the habits of Pribilof sandpipers, Mr. Palmer\r\n(1899) says:\r\n\r\n     They appear stupid when solitary and without a family, and will\r\n     stand perfectly still, eying one from a little eminence.\r\n     Occasionally we are startled by a loud _druuett_ from the side of a\r\n     sand dune, and I was at a loss for some time to discover the owner\r\n     of this most unmusical sound, which finally turned out to be an\r\n     individual of this species standing motionless and watching us. It\r\n     would seem impossible for this sound to have issued from this bird\r\n     if I had not seen it in the act. These sandpipers have the habit in\r\n     common with others of their kind of suddenly elevating the wing\r\n     directly over the back. Often when alighting on the tundra, as soon\r\n     as they stopped up went one wing, followed soon after, perhaps, by\r\n     the other. Often while watching a flock on the lagoon beach first\r\n     one would elevate a wing, then another; it was always the near wing\r\n     which went up first. I never saw a bird elevate the off wing first.\r\n     I know of no reason for their doing so. They are tame. I have\r\n     walked up to a flock of about 50, and with care could drive them\r\n     before me for some distance before they took flight, being but a\r\n     few feet away. They are often seen feeding in the water up to their\r\n     breasts, and seem to take delight in it. They swim readily, but not\r\n     often. On June 30 I saw one fly out to a stone in a pool, and after\r\n     gathering all the food possible it deliberately swam to another,\r\n     and having visited each stone in the same way flew back to the\r\n     shore and then bathed itself, occasionally taking a swim.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Mr. Hanna (1921) describes the notes of this bird as follows:\r\n\r\n     If a person climbs to the sandpiper country on St. George during\r\n     May or June one of his first surprises will be a series of notes\r\n     very much like those of the flicker, a full deep whistle repeated\r\n     in the same pitch about a dozen times in quick succession. The bird\r\n     utters this while on the wing, most likely when it is coming toward\r\n     the intruder with great speed. When close by it wheels and settles\r\n     lightly on a near-by hummock or \"niggerhead.\" One wing will be held\r\n     vertically extended for a few seconds after alighting and may be\r\n     flashed at short intervals thereafter. Another note for which I\r\n     have no descriptive language always reminded me of the sound of\r\n     tree frogs. It is the note usually given when the birds are on the\r\n     ground. While neither can be called a song they are very attractive\r\n     and pleasant to the listener and most surprising to one familiar\r\n     with the \"peep peep\" of sandpipers in winter.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--In winter the Pribilof sandpiper looks much like the\r\npurple sandpiper; it frequents similar haunts and has much the same\r\nhabits. But its summer plumage, with its rufous upper parts and mottled\r\nunder parts, is strikingly different. It resembles the Aleutian\r\nsandpiper in all plumages, but it is decidedly larger and, in summer,\r\nits upper parts are lighter rufous and there is more white in the under\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--According to Preble and McAtee (1923):\r\n\r\n     About the middle of July, when the nesting birds are freed from\r\n     family cares, they begin to resort to the beaches to feed, and at\r\n     night gather in flocks to roost on some favorite rocky point. Later\r\n     the young join the adults and the flocks increase in size through\r\n     August. About August 9 the birds began to be common about the\r\n     beaches, the flocks there apparently being in excess of the number\r\n     breeding on the islands, and in all probability, therefore,\r\n     comprised in part of migrants from other breeding stations. They\r\n     continued to be abundant until my departure on the last of August.\r\n\r\nThe Pribilof sandpiper is too rare and beautiful to be treated as a game\r\nbird, but Mr. Hanna (1921) writes:\r\n\r\n     The birds possess some economic importance to the natives of the\r\n     Pribilofs, and they have occasionally been eaten in the officers'\r\n     messes. Their habit of congregating in fairly compact flocks and\r\n     their fearless unassuming nature make them easy targets. For this\r\n     reason close watch should be kept of the numbers returning\r\n     annually, and should any noticeable diminution take place strict\r\n     prohibitive measures can and should be invoked. This is possible\r\n     because the islands are under strict governmental control as\r\n     regards all wild life. Because of its limited range it would not be\r\n     a difficult matter to completely exterminate the species. Special\r\n     protective measures at this time, however, are not believed to be\r\n     essential because there is even less hunting now than there has\r\n     been for fifty or more years. The introduction of livestock and\r\n     reindeer for fresh food removes in large measure the necessity for\r\n     shooting, and the native is ordinarily too indolent to hunt unless\r\n     he has to do so for food.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Known only from the islands in Bering Sea and the coast of\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The Pribilof sandpiper breeds on the Pribilof Islands\r\n(St. Paul and St. George Islands) and north in Bering Sea to St. Matthew\r\nIsland, Hall Island, and St. Lawrence Island.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The winter range is imperfectly known, but it has been\r\ntaken in this season at Portage Bay, Alaska, and probably occupies much\r\nof the Alaskan coast southeastward to (rarely) the Lynn Canal.\r\n\r\n_Migration._--They have been noted in spring to arrive at St. Paul\r\nIsland March 5; Nushagak, Alaska, April 1 to 14; St. George Island April\r\n23; at St. Paul Island April 24; and Point Dall, Alaska, May 23.\r\n\r\nLate departures in the fall have been observed at St. George Island,\r\nOctober 3; and St. Paul Island November 16.\r\n\r\nEarly fall arrivals have been noted on the Alaskan coast at Igiak Bay,\r\nJuly 23; Tigalda Island, August 5; Unimak, August 14; and Dexter, Norton\r\nSound, August 29.\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Pribilof Island: 32 records, May 6 to July 2; 16 records,\r\nMay 30 to June 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nARQUATELLA PTILOCNEMIS COUESI (Ridgway)\r\n\r\nALEUTIAN SANDPIPER\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nI prefer the above scientific name to the Check List name, because I can\r\nnot believe that the Aleutian sandpiper is a subspecies of the purple\r\nsandpiper. The Aleutian sandpiper was originally described by Robert\r\nRidgway (1880) as a distinct species. Later it was treated, and still\r\nstands on our Check List, as a subspecies of the purple sandpiper,\r\nbecause it somewhat resembles it in its winter plumage. In Mr. Ridgway's\r\n(1919) latest work, he treats it as a subspecies of the Pribilof\r\nsandpiper, a closely related form, which had been previously described;\r\nhe there describes it as \"similar to _A. p. ptilocnemis_ but decidedly\r\nsmaller and much darker in color; the summer plumage with blackish and\r\nrusty or cinnamon-rufous predominating on back and scapulars, and all\r\nthe colors much darker and more extended. Very similar in winter plumage\r\nto _A. maritima_, but summer plumage and young very different, both\r\nbeing conspicuously marked with rusty on back and scapulars, and the\r\nsummer plumage with breast conspicuously blotched or clouded with\r\ndusky.\"\r\n\r\nAmong a series of 11 birds of this species, which we collected on Attu\r\nIsland, at the extreme western end of the Aleutian Chain, on June 23,\r\n1911, are two birds which closely resemble _ptilocnemis_ in color, but\r\nin size are typical of _couesi_. At least one of them was a breeding\r\nbird, the parent of a brood of downy young, and doubtless both of them\r\nwere summer resident birds. Dr. Ernst Hartert (1920) has described the\r\nresident bird of the Commander Islands as a distinct subspecies, under\r\nthe name _Erolia maritima quarta_, of which he says: \"In full summer\r\nplumage the feather-edgings are broader than in any other form and\r\nbrighter, more rusty red, so that the rusty red seems to predominate on\r\nthe whole of the upper parts.\" This description seems to fit our two\r\nbirds from Attu Island very well; so that, if _quarta_ is a recognizable\r\nform, as it seems to be, this subspecies should be added to our North\r\nAmerican list. The birds could easily fly across from the Commander\r\nIslands to Attu Island and establish themselves there.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The spring migration of this sandpiper is not extensive. Many\r\nbirds have remained all winter on or near their breeding grounds in the\r\nAleutian Islands; others have wintered along the coast as far south as\r\nWashington. D. E. Brown tells me that they remain on Destruction Island\r\nuntil May 1 and that they have been seen on Forrester Island as late as\r\nJune 15. H. S. Swarth (1911) found them \"very abundant\" on Kuiu Island\r\nduring his stay there from April 25 to May 6; he writes:\r\n\r\n     In company with the black turnstone and some other waders, they\r\n     frequented the broad mud flats, which, at low tide, extend over\r\n     hundreds of acres at this point. As the tide advanced their feeding\r\n     grounds became more and more restricted, until, as the last\r\n     available spot was covered, the whole flock departed, with roar of\r\n     wings, to some jutting rocks at the mouth of the bay, there to\r\n     remain, preening their plumage and resting, until the receding\r\n     waters again exposed the mud banks. The flocks seen at this place\r\n     comprised many hundred individuals, and it is curious that the\r\n     species was observed absolutely nowhere else.\r\n\r\nHerbert W. Brandt says in his notes from Hooper Bay:\r\n\r\n     The Aleutian sandpiper is a common transient visitor in the\r\n     vicinity of Point Dall and is said by the natives to be a breeding\r\n     bird in the mountain fastnesses of Cape Romanzoff. This species was\r\n     first identified by us on May 18, but it may have arrived a few\r\n     days earlier because up to that time we did not suspect its\r\n     presence. It associated itself with the red-backed sandpiper, to\r\n     which in the field it has a marked superficial resemblance and in\r\n     consequence we may have overlooked it. These birds at that time\r\n     travelled in bands of from 20 to 40 individuals and at low tide fed\r\n     on the ice-bound sea beach that was then exposed, but when the high\r\n     water came in and up to the wall of shore ice, thus covering their\r\n     feeding grounds, they moved back along the open river margins and\r\n     marshy pond borders. From May 23 to May 28 they were very common,\r\n     when suddenly they departed, only to reappear in early July. The\r\n     natives are very positive in their assertions that this island\r\n     dweller breeds in the rugged mountains about Cape Romanzoff, but as\r\n     we did not visit that area we could not authenticate their\r\n     statements, nor did we learn anything of its nidification.\r\n\r\nLucien M. Turner (1886) writes:\r\n\r\n     The Aleutian sandpiper arrives at St. Michaels early in May of each\r\n     year, and in considerable numbers, being generally, on their\r\n     arrival, in the dark plumage, which is changed for the summer by\r\n     the first of June on this locality. On their appearance they are\r\n     strictly littoral-maritime, resorting to the larger bowlders and\r\n     rocky shelves covered with seaweed, among which these birds\r\n     industriously search for slugs and other marine worms. Usually\r\n     several birds are together, rarely singly, and seldom over 8 or 10\r\n     in a flock.\r\n\r\nDr. Leonhard Stejneger (1885) says that, in the Commander Islands:\r\n\r\n     In March their ranks are reinforced by newcomers which have\r\n     wintered on more hospitable shores, and in the latter part of the\r\n     month enormous flocks of 500 or more swarm along the beach,\r\n     especially on the north shore. About one month later the great\r\n     flocks dissolve into small companies, which, following the water\r\n     courses, disperse over the whole island, settling in pairs on\r\n     suitable places at the beaches, on the tundras, or on the mountain\r\n     plateaus, this bird being in fact one of the most numerous and the\r\n     most equally distributed species of land birds on the islands.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--We frequently observed the charming song flight of this\r\nsandpiper in the Aleutian Islands. The birds were especially abundant on\r\nTanaga Island, where we found them nesting on the little knolls or\r\nhummocks on the tundra in a large alluvial plain back of the beach\r\nhillocks. The males were very active and noisy, indulging in their\r\nhovering song flights, rising 30 or 40 feet in the air and fluttering\r\ndown while pouring out a delightful twittering song. Also, while flying\r\nabout or while standing on some prominent hummock, they gave their loud,\r\nmusical melodious calls of the upland plover; these loud notes were not\r\nheard anywhere except on their breeding grounds and were probably notes\r\nof greeting or of warning to their mates. Doctor Stejneger (1885)\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     It was in the late afternoon of the 28th of April, 1883, that I\r\n     first witnessed this singing performance of the sandpiper. The bird\r\n     rose from the _Rhododendron_ tundra on the northern slope of\r\n     Kamennij Valley, and while flying about on quivering wings,\r\n     sometimes remaining quite still in the air, it uttered a loud,\r\n     agreeable, and melodious twitter, which really must be called a\r\n     \"song,\" whereupon, with outstretched wings, it descended obliquely,\r\n     seating itself upon the top of a tussock. Sitting there, with\r\n     puffed plumage and pendant wings, it produced a loud \"bleating,\" so\r\n     much like that of _Gallinago gallinago_ as to completely convince\r\n     me that the analogous note of the latter is produced by the throat\r\n     in exactly the same manner. During the \"bleating\" the whole bird\r\n     was quivering with a tremulous motion as if in a high state of\r\n     excitement. The voice was slightly more melodious than that of the\r\n     snipe.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--While wandering over the foothills of Kiska Island on June\r\n17, 1911, I found my first nest of the Aleutian sandpiper. I was\r\ncrossing a flat place, high up on a hill, covered with moss and scanty\r\ngrowth of grass, when the bird fluttered off almost underfoot, feigning\r\nlameness. The nest was a deep hollow in the moss, 3 inches in diameter\r\nand fully 2 inches deep, partially concealed by a few blades of scanty\r\ngrass, and lined with dead leaves, a few straws, and a few feathers of\r\nthe bird. The four eggs were only slightly incubated. I found a similar\r\nnest, containing three small, downy young, on Attu Island on June 23;\r\nthe nest was on a little hummock on a hillside, a deep hollow, lined\r\nwith dead leaves and bits of straw. It was the male bird that flew from\r\nthe nest in both cases.\r\n\r\nAustin H. Clark (1910) found a nest on Attu Island on the side of a\r\nmountain, 700 feet or more above the valley and near an extensive patch\r\nof snow. Alfred M. Bailey (1925) found a nest at Emma Harbor, Siberia,\r\non July 4, 1921, containing three young and an egg; the nest was \"on the\r\nshores of the bay, in gravel along the beach.\" He also found several\r\nnests the following season near Wales, Alaska; \"the nesting sites varied\r\nfrom exposed depressions in the moss to well-concealed dried grass.\" A\r\nset of eggs in Edward Arnold's collection, taken by Sheldon and Lamont\r\non Montague Island, Alaska, June 22, 1916, came from a nest \"on débris\r\njust above tidewater.\"\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The Aleutian sandpiper almost invariably lays four eggs,\r\nalthough five have been found. These are ovate pyriform in shape and\r\nhave a slight gloss. The ground color is \"olive buff\" or \"deep olive\r\nbuff.\" They are heavily, boldly, and irregularly blotched, chiefly about\r\nthe larger end, with a few scattering smaller spots. The markings are in\r\ndark browns, \"chestnut brown,\" \"burnt umber,\" and \"seal brown,\" varying\r\nwith the thickness of the pigment. There are underlying blotches of\r\n\"brownish drab,\" producing very handsome eggs. They can not always be\r\ndistinguished with certainty from eggs of the Pribilof sandpiper, as\r\nthey vary greatly in size; they average smaller, but the measurements\r\noverlap widely. The measurements of 50 eggs average 38 by 26.6\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =43.2= by 26.8,\r\n39.4 by =28=, =35= by 26.3, and 37.3 by =24.1= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Incubation is apparently performed by both sexes, and both\r\nassist in the care of the young. The birds that I flushed from my two\r\nnests, one with eggs and one with young, both proved to be males. Mr.\r\nTurner (1886) says:\r\n\r\n     The males are much devoted to their mates while incubating, and I\r\n     have every reason to believe that the male does the greater part of\r\n     the labor of incubating, as they were the ones generally found\r\n     either on or near the nests. When alighting near the nest either\r\n     sex has the habit of raising its wings perpendicularly and slowly\r\n     folding them, all the while uttering a trilling peep, continued for\r\n     several seconds.\r\n\r\nThe parents are very devoted to their young, employing the usual tactics\r\nto divert the attention of the intruder, stumbling and fluttering over\r\nthe ground, as if both legs and wings were broken. The young leave the\r\nnest as soon as they are strong enough to run, but remain with their\r\nparents until they are fully fledged in their first winter or juvenal\r\nplumage and ready to fly in August.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy young Aleutian resembles, in color pattern, the\r\nyoung purple sandpiper, but can easily be recognized by its warmer and\r\nricher browns. The upper half of the head is \"warm buff,\" shading off to\r\n\"pale buff\" on the lores and cheeks and to pure white on the throat and\r\nneck. A median black stripe is broad on the crown, tapering to a point\r\nat the bill; loral and malar black stripes converge at the bill; the\r\nrest of the upper head is spotted or striped with black. The nape is a\r\nmixture of dull buff and dusky. The back, wings, and thighs are\r\nvariegated with black, \"ochraceous tawny\" and \"warm buff,\" everywhere\r\nsprinkled with conspicuous dots, terminal tufts, of buffy white in an\r\nirregular pattern; there is a more or less well-defined black patch in\r\nthe center of the back, varying in different individuals, centrally\r\nveiled with \"burnt sienna\" tips. The entire under parts are pure white.\r\n\r\nIn the juvenal plumage the center of the crown is blackish brown, with\r\n\"ochraceous tawny\" edgings; the rest of the crown and nape are \"deep\r\nmouse gray\"; the feathers of the back are brownish black, broadly edged\r\nwith \"tawny\" or \"ochraceous tawny\"; the scapulars and all the wing\r\ncoverts are deep sepia, broadly edged with colors varying from \"tawny\"\r\nto buffy white, whitest on the coverts; the under parts are white, with\r\na broad band of pale buff across the throat and breast; the flanks are\r\nsomewhat tinged with the same color; the throat, breast, and flanks are\r\nmore or less heavily marked with median dusky streaks. This plumage is\r\nworn through July and part, or all, of August. The postjuvenal molt of\r\nthe body plumage begins in some birds about the 1st of August, but in\r\nothers not until two or three weeks later. This produces a first winter\r\nplumage similar to that of the adult, but distinguishable by the faded\r\njuvenal wing coverts and a few retained scapulars and tertials.\r\n\r\nThe partial prenuptial molt of both young birds and adults comes rather\r\nlate in the spring, April and May, and involves the body plumage and\r\nsome of the wing coverts and scapulars. Adults also have a complete\r\npostnuptial molt, beginning in August and lasting until October. The\r\nwinter plumage is similar to that of the purple sandpiper, but it is\r\nconspicuously marked on the breast and flanks with large triangular or\r\ncircular spots of dusky, whereas the purple sandpiper usually has a\r\nplain gray breast in winter.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Very little seems to be known about the food of the Aleutian\r\nsandpiper, but probably its diet is very similar to that of the purple\r\nsandpiper, which has similar feeding habits. Both species are fond of\r\nfrequenting rocky shores and stony beaches, where they seem to be\r\ngleaning food. Doctor Stejneger (1885) has seen them \"at low water\r\neagerly picking up Gammarids among the stones close to the breakers.\"\r\nBernard J. Bretherton (1896) writes:\r\n\r\n     Large flocks of these birds were seen during February, 1893, but\r\n     were not met with during other winters. They were met with on a low\r\n     sand bar, after a protracted storm which had thrown up millions of\r\n     sand fleas, upon which they were feeding so industriously as to be\r\n     easily approached and to which feast they returned several times,\r\n     even after their ranks had been thinned by raking charges of fine\r\n     shot.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--In many ways the Aleutian sandpiper reminds one of its near\r\nrelative, the purple sandpiper, but it is even tamer, less suspicious,\r\nand quieter in its movements. We had plenty of chances to get acquainted\r\nwith it in the Aleutian Islands. We met it, and collected the first\r\nspecimen of it, on the first island that we landed on, Akun Island, and\r\nafter that we saw it on every island we visited, though it was much more\r\nabundant on the more western islands. These bleak islands, with their\r\nforbidding, rocky shores and stony beaches, washed with cold spray or\r\nenveloped in chilly fog, are the summer home of this hardy little \"beach\r\nsnipe,\" as it is called by the natives. It moves about so quietly and\r\ndeliberately, and its colors match its surroundings so well, that we\r\nwere constantly coming upon it unexpectedly. It was usually so intent on\r\nfeeding that it paid no attention to passers-by; it was often necessary\r\nto back off to a reasonable distance before shooting one, and I shot\r\nseveral with squib charges in an auxiliary barrel. It is the tamest and\r\nmost unsuspicious shore bird I have ever seen. On this point Mr. Turner\r\n(1886) says:\r\n\r\n     It is not at all shy, depending more on its color to hide by\r\n     squatting among the crevices of the dark lava rocks and thus be\r\n     unobserved. When cautiously approached, these birds generally run\r\n     to the highest part of the rock or bowlder which they are on, then\r\n     huddle together before taking flight the moment after. This habit\r\n     allows them to be nearly all killed at a single discharge of the\r\n     gun. The native boys, having observed this habit of these birds,\r\n     procure a club about two feet long, and when the birds huddle\r\n     together before taking flight the club is hurled in such manner as\r\n     to sweep all the birds off the rock. This manner of procuring these\r\n     birds is practiced by the western Aleut boys to a great degree.\r\n\r\nDr. E. W. Nelson (1887) writes:\r\n\r\n     A pair were found feeding on a series of bare, jagged rocks, over\r\n     which the spray flew in a dense cloud as every wave beat at the\r\n     foot of the rocky shore. I shot one of them, and the survivor\r\n     merely flew up and stood eyeing me silently from the top of a low\r\n     cliff 20 or 25 feet overhead until it, too, fell a victim. Later in\r\n     the day another was seen near the border of a small lake in the\r\n     interior of the island. It ran nimbly on before me, over the mossy\r\n     hillocks, stopping every few feet and half turning to watch my\r\n     movements, just as a spotted sandpiper would do under the\r\n     circumstances. When driven to take wing, it flew a short distance,\r\n     with the same peculiar down-curved wings and style of flight as has\r\n     the spotted sandpiper.\r\n\r\nHamilton M. Laing (1925) says that \"on one occasion one was seen to swim\r\nnimbly from one rock to another rather than fly.\"\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Except on its breeding grounds, we considered the Aleutian\r\nsandpiper a very quiet and silent bird. Its twittering flight song is a\r\npart of the nuptial ceremony, and it was only on its nesting grounds\r\nthat we heard the loud, musical, flutelike, whistling notes so\r\nsuggestive of the melodious calls of the upland plover. Doctor Nelson\r\n(1887) describes what may be the same notes, as follows:\r\n\r\n     While on the wing it uttered a rather low but clear and musical\r\n     _tweo-tweo-tweo_. When feeding it had a note something like a call\r\n     of the _Colaptes auratus_, and which may be represented by the\r\n     syllables _clu-clu-clu_.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark (1910) also says:\r\n\r\n     The cry is loud and clear, bearing a striking resemblance to the\r\n     call of the flicker.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--In winter the Aleutian sandpiper might easily be\r\nmistaken for a purple sandpiper, which it closely resembles in\r\nappearance, haunts, and behavior, but the winter ranges of the two\r\nspecies are widely separated. From the Pribilof sandpiper it differs in\r\nbeing decidedly smaller, and in summer it is much darker, with less\r\nrufous above and more black below.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--The Aleutian sandpiper withdraws in the fall from the northern\r\nportions of its breeding range in Alaska and Siberia, and it may be that\r\nthe birds which breed farthest north are the ones which migrate farthest\r\nsouth to spend the winter, for the species is resident throughout the\r\nyear in the Aleutian Islands. In the Norton Sound region it evidently\r\noccurs only as a migrant from northern Alaska and Siberia. Doctor Nelson\r\n(1887) says:\r\n\r\n     Early in August, however, I was pleased to find it abundant in\r\n     parties of from five to thirty or forty about outlying islets and\r\n     along rugged portions of the shore. During each of the four\r\n     succeeding seasons the same experience was repeated, and the last\r\n     of July or first of August I was certain to find the numbers of\r\n     them in the situations mentioned, where earlier in the season not\r\n     one was to be found. They always remained until the middle of\r\n     October, when the beaches became covered with ice and they were\r\n     forced to seek a milder climate. The 1st of October, as the first\r\n     snowstorms begin, these birds desert the more exposed islets and\r\n     beaches for the inner bays and sandy beaches, where their habits\r\n     are like those of other sandpipers in similar situations.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--This hardy sandpiper is well known to winter regularly and\r\nabundantly in the Aleutian and Commander Islands. According to notes\r\nreceived from D. E. Brown, it reaches the coast of Washington as early\r\nas October 1, where it spends the winter in Grays Harbor and Jefferson\r\nCounties and on the outer islands. Carl Lien's notes, from Destruction\r\nIsland, give it as a \"common winter resident. A flock of probably 50\r\nspend the winter. Nearly always found in company with turnstones and\r\nsurfbirds, and together with these birds confine themselves entirely to\r\nthe reefs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--The northeastern corner of Siberia, west coast of Alaska and\r\nadjacent islands, including the Aleutians, south (rarely) to\r\nnorthwestern Oregon.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The breeding range of the Aleutian sandpiper extends\r\nnorth to eastern Siberia (Emma Harbor) and Alaska (Cape Prince of\r\nWales). East to Alaska (Cape Prince of Wales, Colville River, and Port\r\nMoller); and the Shumagin Islands. South to the Shumagin Islands; the\r\nwestern part of the Alaskan Peninsula (Muller Bay and Morzhovia Bay);\r\nand the Aleutian Islands (Unalaska, Atka, Tanaga, Kiska, Agutta, and\r\nAttu Islands). West to the Aleutian Islands (Attu) and eastern Siberia\r\n(Emma Harbor). The species also has been detected in summer at St.\r\nLawrence and St. Matthew Islands and at other points on the mainland of\r\nAlaska (Point Dall, Pastolik, St. Michael, Nulato, and Port Clarence).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--Resident throughout much of its range, but also south\r\nin winter, along the Alaskan and British Columbian coasts and as far as\r\nWashington (Destruction Island).\r\n\r\n_Migration._--The migrations performed by the Aleutian sandpiper are\r\nvery limited. In the vicinity of St. Michael, Alaska, flocks will appear\r\nas early as August 15, occasionally remaining until October 15. They\r\nhave been noted on the Asiatic side of Bering Sea at Providence Bay in\r\nJune, at East Cape in July, at Plover Bay in September, and on Bering\r\nIsland as late as October 24.\r\n\r\nSpring migrants have been observed to reach Point Etolin, Alaska, as\r\nearly as April 8 and Bering Island April 24. Spring departures from the\r\nsouthern part of the winter range have been noted as late as:\r\nDestruction Island, May 1; Forrester Island, May 7; and Admiralty\r\nIsland, May 14. An early fall arrival at Craig, Alaska, is August 6 and\r\nat Destruction Island October 1.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--This species has been collected or observed outside\r\nof its known normal range on a few occasions: Washington, Point\r\nChehalis, November 6, 1917, and Dungeness Spit, March 4, 1916; Oregon,\r\nCape Meares, December 31, 1912, and March 18, 1913; these may prove to\r\nbe regular winter resorts.\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Alaska: 18 records, June 3 to July 24; 9 records, June 15\r\nto 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nPISOBIA ACUMINATA (Horsfield)\r\n\r\nSHARP-TAILED SANDPIPER\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThis is a bird which few of us have been privileged to see. From its\r\nsummer home in northeastern Siberia it migrates south to Japan, the\r\nMalay Archipelago, Australia, and New Zealand. On the fall migration it\r\nvisits the coast of northwestern Alaska frequently, perhaps regularly,\r\nand often commonly. It occurs regularly, sometimes abundantly, on the\r\nPribilof Islands in the fall. In southern Alaska and farther south it\r\noccurs only as a rare straggler. A. W. Anthony (1922) took a young male\r\nnear San Diego, California, on September 16, 1921.\r\n\r\nSome European writers have called it the Siberian pectoral sandpiper,\r\nwhich its resemblance to our common bird of that name seems to warrant.\r\nIt is so much like our pectoral sandpiper in appearance, behavior, and\r\nhaunts, that it has probably often been overlooked; it may therefore\r\noccur on our northwestern coast much oftener than we suspect.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The sharp-tailed sandpiper is supposed to breed in Mongolia\r\nand eastern Siberia; it has been seen and collected on its breeding\r\ngrounds in northeastern Siberia, Cape Wankarem, the Chuckchi Peninsula,\r\nand the Kolyma Delta, but apparently its nest has never been found and\r\nits eggs are entirely unknown.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy young is entirely unknown. This sandpiper is\r\nhandsomely and richly colored in any plumage, but the rich buff and\r\nbright browns of the juvenal plumage are particularly noticeable. The\r\nbody plumage is molted in the fall, the wings and tail in late winter,\r\nand the body plumage is partially molted again in the spring. The\r\nplumages are well described in the manuals.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Preble and McAtee (1923) report on the food of this species, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Eight well-filled and one nearly empty stomach of the sharp-tailed\r\n     sandpiper are available to illustrate the food habits. This number\r\n     is too small to furnish reliable results, and too great dependence\r\n     must not be placed in data as to the relative ranks of food items\r\n     as here stated. The percentages found for the limited material,\r\n     then, are flies (Diptera), 39.1 per cent; crustaceans, 18.1 per\r\n     cent; mollusks, 14.2 per cent; caddisflies, 11.8 per cent; beetles,\r\n     8.8 per cent; Hymenoptera, 1.8 per cent; and vegetable matter, 3.9\r\n     per cent. Mr. Hanna notes that flocks of this species frequent the\r\n     seal-killing fields, feeding on fly maggots, a statement receiving\r\n     confirmation from stomach analysis.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Dr. E. W. Nelson (1887) tells us a little about the habits\r\nof this rare species, as follows:\r\n\r\n     They were nearly always associated with _maculata_, whose habits\r\n     they shared to a great extent. When congregated about their feeding\r\n     places they united into flocks of from ten into fifty, but single\r\n     birds were frequently flushed from and they were rarely shy. On\r\n     October 1, 1880, they were found scattered singly over the marsh,\r\n     and arose 30 to 40 yards in advance, and made off with a twisting\r\n     flight, uttering at the same time a short, soft, metallic _pleep,\r\n     pleep,_ and pursuing an erratic, circuitous flight for a time they\r\n     generally returned and settled near the spot whence they started.\r\n     On the shore of Siberia, near North Cape, we found these birds very\r\n     common, scattered over damp grass flats near the coast, the 1st of\r\n     August, 1881. The ground was covered with reindeer tracks, and\r\n     among these the sharp-tailed snipe were seen seeking their food.\r\n     They were very unsuspicious and allowed us to pass close to them,\r\n     or circled close about us. From their movements and other\r\n     circumstances I judged that this district formed part of their\r\n     breeding grounds, whence they reach the neighboring coast of Alaska\r\n     in fall.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The sharp-tailed sandpiper most closely resembles the\r\npectoral sandpiper, but it can often be recognized in the field by the\r\nmore ruddy color of the upper parts. Most of the feathers of the\r\nshoulders, scapulars and secondaries are broadly edged with chestnut;\r\nthese edgings are paler in winter. The bright chestnut crown, streaked\r\nwith black, and the ruddy brown suffusion on the chest and sides, might\r\nbe recognized under favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Not much seems to be known about the spring migration, but the\r\nfall migration is fairly well marked. Doctor Nelson (1887) says:\r\n\r\n     They usually make their first appearance on the shore of Norton\r\n     Sound the last of August, and in a few days become very common.\r\n     They sometimes remain up to the 12th of October, and I have seen\r\n     them searching for food along the tide line when the ground was\r\n     covered with 2 inches of snow. When feeding along the edges of the\r\n     tide-creeks they may almost be knocked over with a paddle, and when\r\n     a flock is fired into it returns again and again.\r\n\r\nIt is a regular fall migrant in the Pribilof Islands, between August 17\r\nand November 9, where it associates in large flocks with the pectoral\r\nsandpiper on the seal-killing fields.\r\n\r\nDoctor Stejneger (1885) writes:\r\n\r\n     Of this species I only obtained young specimens on Bering Island\r\n     during the autumnal migration of 1882. From the middle of September\r\n     and during the following three weeks they were observed both on the\r\n     tundra near the great lake and on the rocky beach of the ocean\r\n     searching for Gammarids. They were very shy and mostly single or in\r\n     small families. Larger flocks were never seen.\r\n\r\nFrom the Commander Islands the main flight continues on down the Asiatic\r\ncoast, through Japan, China, and the Malay Archipelago, to New Zealand\r\nand Australia, where it spends the winter.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--W. B. Alexander writes to me that this is--\r\n\r\n     One of the commonest northern breeding birds which visits\r\n     Australia. My earliest record of their arrival is August 31, 1925,\r\n     at Cairns, North Queensland, and my latest record April 21, 1922,\r\n     at Rockhampton, Queensland. From September to March they are to be\r\n     found in small flocks throughout the coastal districts of Australia\r\n     on the shores of estuaries and lakes and in fresh-water swamps. In\r\n     October, 1922, I saw a flock of four on the open country near a dam\r\n     on Alice Downs Station, near Blackall, central Queensland, a\r\n     locality about 350 miles from the coast. Mr. D. W. Gaukrodger\r\n     subsequently secured an excellent photograph of three of these\r\n     birds at the same dam.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--The sharp-tailed sandpiper breeds in the northeastern part of\r\nAsia--so far as known, in northeastern Siberia--wintering south to New\r\nGuinea, Tonga Islands, Australia, and New Zealand. Occurs in migration\r\nin Kamchatka, China, and Japan.\r\n\r\nDuring fall migration it is of regular though rare occurrence in Alaska\r\n(Hotham Inlet, September 1, 1880; Port Clarence, September 9, 1880;\r\nNome, September 2 to 16, 1910; St. Michael, September 16, 1877, August\r\n29 and September 11, 1879, September 18, 21, and 24, 1899; Bethel,\r\nSeptember 30 and October 1, 1914; St. Paul Island, August 17, 1897,\r\nSeptember 7 and 13, 1910, September 14 and 20 and October 12, 1914; St.\r\nGeorge Island, October 3, 1899; and Valdez, September 18, 1908).\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--The species is accidental in British Columbia\r\n(Massett, December 27, 1897, and Comox, October 4, 1903); Washington\r\n(mouth of the Nooksack River, September 2, 1892); England (Breydon,\r\nNorfolk, August, 1892, and Yarmouth, September, 1848 [?]); and the\r\nHawaiian Islands (Laysan [specimen in museum at Bremen], a second\r\nspecimen near Honolulu, a third specimen was collected on Maui\r\n[Henshaw], and Bartsch secured two specimens and saw others on Sand\r\nIsland, November 8, 1907). One was taken near San Diego, Calif., on\r\nSeptember 16, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\nPISOBIA MACULATA (Vieillot)\r\n\r\nPECTORAL SANDPIPER\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThis familiar sandpiper is well known as a migrant throughout most of\r\nNorth America, especially east of the Rocky Mountains, as it travels on\r\nits long journeys between the Arctic tundras, where it breeds, and its\r\nwinter home in southern South America. It is more popular among gunners\r\nthan the other small sandpipers, to whom it is known by several names.\r\nIt is called \"jack snipe\" on account of its resemblance in appearance\r\nand habits to the Wilson snipe. It deserves the name, \"grass bird,\"\r\nbecause it usually frequents grassy meadows. The name, \"creaker,\"\r\n\"creeker,\" or \"Krieker,\" may have been derived from its reedy notes,\r\nfrom its haunts along the muddy banks of creeks, or from the German word\r\n_Kriecher_, on account of its crouching habits.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The northward migration must start from Argentina in\r\nFebruary, for it reaches Texas and Louisiana early in March, and I have\r\nseen it in Florida as early as March 14. On the other hand it has been\r\ntaken at Mendoza, Argentina, as late as March 26. The main flight passes\r\nthrough the United States during March and April, but I have seen it in\r\nTexas as late as May 17. During May the migration is at its height in\r\nCanada and before the end of that month it reaches its summer home.\r\nWilliam Rowan tells me that it is always very abundant in Alberta during\r\nMay and that the males come alone at first, then mixed flocks, and\r\nfinally only females. H. B. Conover writes to me that \"these sandpipers\r\nseemed to arrive at Point Dall (Alaska) all at once. Up to May 20 none\r\nhad been seen, but on the 21st they were found to be common all over the\r\ntundra. Immediately on arrival the males started their booming\r\ncourtship.\" John Murdoch (1885) says that, at Point Barrow:\r\n\r\n     They arrive about the end of May or early in June, and frequent the\r\n     small ponds and marshy portions of the tundra along the shore,\r\n     sometimes associated with other small waders, especially with the\r\n     buff-breasted sandpipers on the high banks of Nunava. Early in the\r\n     season they are frequently in large-sized flocks feeding together\r\n     around and in the Eskimo village at Cape Smythe, but later become\r\n     thoroughly scattered all over the tundra.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--The wonderful and curious courtship of the pectoral\r\nsandpiper has been well described by several writers. Dr. E. W. Nelson's\r\n(1887) pleasing and graphic account of it is well worth quoting in full;\r\nhe writes:\r\n\r\n     The night of May 24 I lay wrapped in my blanket, and from the\r\n     raised flap of the tent looked out over as dreary a cloud-covered\r\n     landscape as can be imagined. The silence was unbroken save by the\r\n     tinkle and clinking of the disintegrating ice in the river, and at\r\n     intervals by the wild notes of some restless loon, which arose in a\r\n     hoarse reverberating cry and died away in a strange gurgling sound.\r\n     As my eyelids began to droop and the scene to become indistinct,\r\n     suddenly a low, hollow, booming note struck my ear and sent my\r\n     thoughts back to a spring morning in northern Illinois, and to the\r\n     loud vibrating tones of the prairie chickens. Again the sound arose\r\n     nearer and more distinct, and with an effort I brought myself back\r\n     to the reality of my position and, resting upon one elbow,\r\n     listened. A few seconds passed and again arose the note; a moment\r\n     later and, gun in hand, I stood outside the tent. The open flat\r\n     extended away on all sides, with apparently not a living creature\r\n     near. Once again the note was repeated close by, and a glance\r\n     revealed its author. Standing in the thin grasses 10 or 15 yards\r\n     from me, with its throat inflated until it was as large as the rest\r\n     of the bird, was a male _A. maculata_. The succeeding days afforded\r\n     opportunity to observe the bird as it uttered its singular notes\r\n     under a variety of situations and at various hours of the day or\r\n     during the light Arctic night. The note is deep, hollow, and\r\n     resonant, but at the same time liquid and musical, and may be\r\n     represented by a repetition of the syllables _too-u, too-u, too-u,\r\n     too-u, too-u, too-u, too-u, too-u_. Before the bird utters these\r\n     notes it fills its esophagus with air to such an extent that the\r\n     breast and throat is inflated to twice or more its natural size,\r\n     and the great air sac thus formed gives the peculiar resonant\r\n     quality to the note.\r\n\r\n     The skin of the throat and breast becomes very flabby and loose at\r\n     this season, and its inner surface is covered with small globular\r\n     masses of fat. When not inflated, the skin loaded with this extra\r\n     weight and with a slightly serous suffusion which is present hangs\r\n     down in a pendulous flap or fold exactly like a dewlap, about an\r\n     inch and a half wide. The esophagus is very loose and becomes\r\n     remarkably soft and distensible, but is easily ruptured in this\r\n     state, as I found by dissection. In the plate accompanying this\r\n     report the extent and character of this inflation, unique at least\r\n     among American waders, is shown. The bird may frequently be seen\r\n     running along the ground close to the female, its enormous sac\r\n     inflated, and its head drawn back and the bill pointing directly\r\n     forward, or, filled with spring-time vigor, the bird flits with\r\n     slow but energetic wingstrokes close along the ground, its head\r\n     raised high over the shoulders and the tail hanging almost directly\r\n     down. As it thus flies it utters a succession of the hollow,\r\n     booming notes, which have a strange ventriloquial quality. At times\r\n     the male rises 20 or 30 yards in the air and inflating its throat\r\n     glides down to the ground with its sac hanging below, as is shown\r\n     in the accompanying plate. Again he crosses back and forth in front\r\n     of the female, puffing his breast out and bowing from side to side,\r\n     running here and there, as if intoxicated with passion. Whenever he\r\n     pursues his love-making, his rather low but pervading note swells\r\n     and dies in musical cadences, which form a striking part of the\r\n     great bird chorus heard at this season in the north.\r\n\r\nMr. Conover (notes) adds the following:\r\n\r\n     When the male rises in the air to boom, in sailing to the ground he\r\n     throws his wings up over his back, much in the same manner as tame\r\n     pigeons when descending from a height; also a male which flew by\r\n     with pouch extended was noticed to jerk his head up and down as he\r\n     gave his call. The bill was partly open and he gave the appearance\r\n     of swallowing air to inflate his throat. As it is the esophagus\r\n     which is inflated and not the windpipe, this in all probability is\r\n     what he does.\r\n\r\nS. A. Buturlin (1907) gives a somewhat different account of it, as\r\nobserved by him in Siberia, as follows:\r\n\r\n     One would every now and then stretch both wings right over its\r\n     back, and afterwards commence a grotesque sort of dance, hopping\r\n     alternately on each leg; another would inflate its gular pouch and\r\n     run about, crouching down to the ground, or would fly up to about a\r\n     hundred feet in the air, then inflate its pouch and descend slowly\r\n     and obliquely to the ground on extended wings. All these\r\n     performances were accompanied by a strange hollow sound, not very\r\n     loud when near, but audible at some distance, even as far as 500\r\n     yards. These notes are very difficult to locate, and vary according\r\n     to the distance. When near they are tremulous booming sounds\r\n     something like the notes of a frog, and end in clear sounds like\r\n     those caused by the bursting of water bubbles in a copper vessel.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Mr. Murdoch (1885) says:\r\n\r\n     The nest is always built in the grass, with a decided preference\r\n     for high and dry localities like the banks of gulleys and streams.\r\n     It was sometimes placed at the edge of a small pool, but always in\r\n     grass and in a dry place, never in the black clay and moss, like\r\n     the plover and buff-breasted sandpipers, or in the marsh, like the\r\n     phalaropes. The nest was like that of the other waders, a\r\n     depression in the ground lined with a little dry grass.\r\n\r\nA set in my collection, taken by F. S. Hersey, near St. Michael, Alaska,\r\nwas in a slight hollow on the open tundra with no concealment. And a set\r\nin the Herbert Massey collection, taken near Point Barrow by E. A.\r\nMcIlhenny, came from \"a slight hollow lined with dry grass, in the dry,\r\ngray moss of the tundra.\"\r\n\r\nHerbert W. Brandt in his manuscript notes says:\r\n\r\n     The pectoral sandpiper usually chooses for its homesite the upland\r\n     rolling tundra, but an occasional isolated pair was found on the\r\n     dry grass lands of the tide flats. This species builds the most\r\n     substantial of any of the shorebirds nests that we met with at\r\n     Hooper Bay, for even after it was removed from the grassy cavity in\r\n     which it was built the nest would often hold firmly together. The\r\n     birds showed exceptional skill in the concealment of their homes\r\n     and consequently they were very difficult to find for they chose a\r\n     tract where the curly bunch grass grew abundantly and under its\r\n     domed protection they constructed an excavation deep in the moss.\r\n     Here a substantial nest is fashioned of grasses and tediously lined\r\n     or rather filled with small crisp leaves of the low perennial\r\n     plants that there, in a dwarf creeping form, are the only\r\n     representatives of the great inland forests. The dimensions vary\r\n     between the following extremes: Inside diameter 3 to 3-1/2 inches;\r\n     depth 1-3/4 to 2-1/2 inches; and outside depth 3-1/2 to 5 inches.\r\n     We never observed other than the female carrying on the loving\r\n     duties of incubation and seldom indeed was the male even in close\r\n     attendance. The female is very difficult to approach on the nest\r\n     because she invariably leaves it before the ornithologist draws\r\n     near and consequently we spent many hours endeavoring to watch the\r\n     shy bird return to her nest.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of parent birds about the nests seems to be variable. W.\r\nSprague Brooks (1915) says:\r\n\r\n     On approaching the vicinity of the nest the bird would leave it\r\n     quietly and walk slowly about feeding and showing no excitement\r\n     whatever. This happened several times until I decided to watch the\r\n     bird and see if by any chance she might have a nest. In a short\r\n     time she walked to a bunch of grass a few feet from me and settled\r\n     on the nest. Even while I was packing away the eggs she showed no\r\n     concern. I had precisely the same experience with the other two\r\n     nests.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Alfred M. Bailey (1926) writes:\r\n\r\n     On July 3 Hendee flushed a female from a set of four slightly\r\n     incubated eggs. \"The nest,\" he states, \"was in a patch of marsh\r\n     grass, similar to the location usually chosen by the phalaropes,\r\n     except that the ground was not wet. The female fluttered away to a\r\n     distance of about 30 feet and went through a remarkable performance\r\n     in her attempt to decoy me from the nest. She crept about among the\r\n     hummocks in a very unbirdlike fashion, uttering all the time a\r\n     mouse-like squeaking.\"\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Mr. Brandt in his manuscript notes has described the eggs so\r\nwell that I can not do better than to quote him, as follows:\r\n\r\n     The eggs of the pectoral sandpiper are of particular interest\r\n     because they are perhaps the most beautiful of the many handsome\r\n     shore-bird eggs that are found in the Hooper Bay region. Their rich\r\n     and contrasting colors, their bold splashed markings, and high\r\n     luster make them veritable gems of oological perfection. In all\r\n     nests that came under our observation four eggs constituted the\r\n     complement, and these generally nestled points together amid the\r\n     crisp leafy lining of their birthplace, standing most often at an\r\n     obtuse angle to the horizontal. In outline they range from\r\n     subpyriform to ovate pyriform. The exterior of the shell has a\r\n     smooth, almost polished surface that reflects in many eggs a high\r\n     luster. The ground color varies considerably from dull white to\r\n     \"cream buff\" and even to \"deep olive buff,\" but in all sets I have\r\n     seen the ground color and markings follow the same shades and types\r\n     in the same set of eggs. The surface markings are bold and\r\n     individual, and appear as if they were daubed with a paint brush.\r\n     These large rich spots are elongated and are placed parallel to the\r\n     long axis of the egg, showing but little tendency to spiral. The\r\n     heaviest markings are at the larger end, often merging into a large\r\n     \"chocolate\" blotch, and in one case this rich blot of color covered\r\n     more than a fourth of the egg. The color of the markings ranges\r\n     from \"walnut brown\" and \"sepia\" to \"chocolate\" and \"blackish\r\n     brown,\" with \"chocolate\" the predominating shade. The underlying\r\n     spots are prominent and numerous on some eggs, while on others they\r\n     are almost wanting. They vary from \"pearl gray\" to \"violet gray,\"\r\n     with an occasional egg inclined to \"Isabella color.\" In fact, each\r\n     different clutch of eggs exhibits some individual interesting\r\n     peculiarity.\r\n\r\nMy only set, taken for me by Mr. Hersey, would fit the above description\r\nvery well, but it is not particularly handsome. The ground color is dull\r\nwhite or \"pale olive buff,\" which is more or less evenly marked with\r\nsmall blotches and spots of \"bister\" and \"bone brown.\" Mr. Murdoch\r\n(1885) says that they \"may be distinguished from those of the\r\nbuff-breasted sandpiper, which they closely resemble, by their warmer\r\ncolor.\" The measurements of 116 eggs, in the United States National\r\nMuseum and in Mr. Brandt's collection, average 36.5 by 25 millimeters;\r\nthe eggs showing the four extremes measure =38.5= by 25, 38 by =27=,\r\n=34= by 24.9, and 35.5 by =24.5= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Mr. Conover writes to me as follows:\r\n\r\n     The incubation period seems to run from 21 to 23 days. A nest found\r\n     May 31 with the complete set of four eggs was hatched on the\r\n     morning of June 21. Another nest containing four eggs, from which\r\n     the old bird was flushed, was found on June 2 and hatched on June\r\n     25. The first young were found on June 21. Contrary to their habits\r\n     when there were only eggs in the nest, the mothers now showed great\r\n     concern for their young. At one time Murie caught some newly\r\n     hatched young, and holding his hand containing them extended on the\r\n     ground, induced the old bird to come up and brood the chicks. She\r\n     was so tame that he caught and banded her without difficulty. The\r\n     male seems to take no part on the incubation or care of the young.\r\n     He was often seen to join a hen driven from the nest, but only for\r\n     purposes of courtship, as he would start booming immediately and\r\n     chase her about. Before the eggs began to hatch, male birds seemed\r\n     to disappear from the tundra. There was never more than one bird\r\n     seen with the young. Thirty days seemed to be about the time\r\n     necessary for the chicks to mature, as by July 20 fully fledged\r\n     young were seen commonly about the tundra.\r\n\r\nMr. Buturlin (1907) says:\r\n\r\n     When I approached the breeding ground the old birds flew to meet\r\n     me, one after another, and wheeled around uttering low tremulous\r\n     notes of various kinds. These calls were evidently meant for the\r\n     young and had different meanings. When the female is with them (and\r\n     you must sit watching for an hour or more to observe this), the\r\n     little ones are somewhat shy and take refuge under her. If you make\r\n     the slightest movement she flies up, uttering the usual _kirip_,\r\n     and kicks the young forwards, never backwards, until they tumble\r\n     head over heels 5 or 6 inches away. There they lie as if dead, but\r\n     with open eyes, and the mother flies around uttering a low\r\n     tremulous _kirip, kirip, trip, trrrrrr_, evidently meaning \"lie\r\n     quite still.\" Then she alights near the young and runs about\r\n     feigning lameness, while trying in every way to make you attempt to\r\n     capture her. If, however, you keep quite quiet she becomes\r\n     reassured, approaches near to where her young are, and utters with\r\n     tender modulations, _day-day-day, day-day-day_, which means\r\n     evidently \"all right, come here.\" Then the chicks commence to chirp\r\n     _peep, peep, peeyp_, and run to their mother. On one occasion I\r\n     observed all this at a distance of about 10 paces, and once I was\r\n     only about 3 paces from them. The downy young know their mother's\r\n     call _day-day-day_ so well that on one occasion a young bird, which\r\n     I was taking home in my butterfly net, when it heard a female call\r\n     quite close to me, climbed out of the net to rejoin her.\r\n\r\nMr. Brandt in his manuscript notes writes:\r\n\r\n     The potential energy stored up in the small richly colored eggs of\r\n     this northern sandpiper is almost beyond comprehension. The downy\r\n     chicks, as soon as they are out of the shell, show wonderful\r\n     activity. When they are but 30 minutes old, their apparently slight\r\n     legs carry them over the ground with great rapidity. They know at\r\n     birth how to hide among the hummocks and vegetation so as to defy\r\n     the sharpest eyes. In three weeks they are awing and six weeks\r\n     later they are off on their long journey to the south, crossing\r\n     mighty mountain ridges, great stretches of land and of sea.\r\n\r\nAccording to W. H. Hudson (1920), the pectoral sandpiper arrives in the\r\nLa Plata region, in southern South America, about the end of August, and\r\nhe writes:\r\n\r\n     Among these first comers there are some young birds, so immature,\r\n     with threads of yellow down still adhering to the feathers of the\r\n     head, and altogether weak in appearance, that one can scarcely\r\n     credit the fact that so soon after being hatched they have actually\r\n     performed the stupendous journey from the northern extremity of the\r\n     North American continent to the Buenos-Ayrean pampas.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The young pectoral in down is a beauty and is distinctively\r\ncolored. The forehead, back to the eyes, lores, sides of the head and\r\nneck, and the breast are from \"cinnamon buff\" to \"cream buff,\" paling to\r\nwhite or grayish white on the throat and belly. There is a broad, black,\r\nmedian stripe from the crown to the bill, a narrow, black loral stripe,\r\nwhich is joined by another, still narrower, malar stripe under the eye,\r\nextending to the auriculars; below the ear is a dark-brown spot. In the\r\ncenter of the crown is a black spot, surrounded by a circle of buffy\r\nwhite dots; around this the crown is a mixture of black and \"burnt\r\nsienna,\" bordered with buffy white, except in front; and around this\r\nborder, or along each side of it, is a narrow stripe of blackish brown\r\nabove the buffy superciliary stripe. The nape is grizzly brown, buff,\r\nand whitish. The back, wings, and thighs are variegated with black,\r\n\"chestnut,\" and \"burnt sienna,\" and decorated with small dots of buffy\r\nwhite in an irregular pattern.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage is much like that of the summer adult, except that\r\nthe feathers of the mantle, scapulars, and the median and lesser wing\r\ncoverts are edged with brighter colors, \"tawny,\" \"ochraceous-buff,\" and\r\ncreamy white; and the breast is more buffy or yellowish. This plumage is\r\napparently worn all through the fall and winter or until the first\r\nprenuptial molt in February and March, when the body plumage is renewed.\r\nAt the first postnuptial molt, the next summer, the young bird becomes\r\nindistinguishable from the adult, having molted the entire plumage.\r\n\r\nAdults have a partial prenuptial molt in the spring, from February to\r\nJune, which involves the body plumage, except the back and rump and some\r\nof the scapulars, tertials, and wing coverts. The complete postnuptial\r\nmolt of adults is much prolonged; the body molt begins in August, but\r\nthe wings are not molted until the bird reaches its winter home,\r\nbeginning in October and often lasting until February. Two adult females\r\ntaken by Doctor Wetmore (1926) on September 9 in Paraguay \"were in worn\r\nbreeding plumage with no indication of molt.\" And one shot in Uruguay\r\nFebruary 8 had renewed all but a few feathers of the entire plumage,\r\nwhile a male taken the same day was molting its primaries. There is very\r\nlittle difference between the summer and winter plumages; the feather\r\nedgings of the upper parts are more rufous in summer and more ashy in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n_Food._--According to Preble and McAtee (1923), the contents of 21\r\nwell-filled gizzards of this species consisted principally of \"flies\r\n(Diptera), 54.5 per cent; amphipods, 22.3 per cent; vegetable matter,\r\nchiefly algae, 10.5 per cent; beetles, 8 per cent; Hymenoptera, 2.1 per\r\ncent; and bugs (Hemiptera), 1.3 per cent.\" Other things eaten were\r\nmites, spiders, and caddis fly larvae and a few seeds of grass, lupine,\r\nand violet. P. L. Hatch (1892) says that \"their food is principally\r\ncrickets in spring, interlarded with various dry-land larvae, small\r\nbeetles, and ground worms. In the fall the grasshoppers are first\r\nchosen, after which crickets and whatever other insects prevail at this\r\nseason.\" Birds taken by B. S. Bowdish (1902) in Porto Rico had eaten\r\nfiddler crabs. Pectoral sandpipers feed mainly in grassy meadows, more\r\nor less dry, and their food is chiefly insects.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--On the grassy salt meadows, where we usually find it, I\r\nhave often been impressed with the resemblance of this sandpiper and the\r\nWilson snipe, both in appearance and in behavior. It is often found in\r\nwisps or scattered flocks, the individuals widely separated and\r\ncrouching in the grass. Often it flushes close at hand with a startling\r\nharsh cry and dashes hurriedly away with a zigzag flight. Sometimes it\r\nflutters away for only a short distance and drops quickly into the\r\ngrass. Again it makes a long flight, circling high in the air and then\r\npitches down suddenly in some distant part of the marsh, or perhaps near\r\nthe starting point. Though erratic at first, the flight is swift and\r\ndirect when well under way. They sometimes fly in flocks like other\r\nsandpipers, but more often they are flushed singly. They usually flock\r\nby themselves but are sometimes associated, purely fortuitously I\r\nbelieve, with other species that frequent similar feeding grounds, such\r\nas Wilson snipe, Baird, least or semipalmated sandpipers.\r\n\r\nThe pectoral sandpiper has another snipelike habit of standing\r\nmotionless in the grass, relying on its concealing coloration, where its\r\nstriped plumage renders it almost invisible, even in plain sight. It\r\nmoves about slowly while feeding, probing in the mud with rapid strokes.\r\nOften it stands perfectly still with its head held high, watching an\r\nintruder; the dark markings on its neck end abruptly on the white\r\nbreast, breaking up the outline and helping the bird to fade into the\r\nbackground. It is occasionally seen swimming across a narrow creek or\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--This is a rather noisy bird, especially so on its breeding\r\nground, and its short, sharp flight notes are quite characteristic of\r\nthe \"creaker.\" Mr. Nichols contributes the following good description of\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n     The notes of the pectoral sandpiper have a reedy character,\r\n     intermediate in tone between the clearer calls of most shore birds\r\n     and the hoarse cry of the Wilson's snipe. This is in keeping with\r\n     its habits. Its characteristic flight note is a loud reedy _kerr_,\r\n     resembling that of the semipalmated sandpiper (_cherk_) more\r\n     closely than any other shore bird call, but recognizably heavier.\r\n     Rarely in flight, the _kerr_ varies into or is replaced by a\r\n     near-whistled _krru_. On being flushed it often has hoarse, hurried\r\n     cheeping notes, analogous with similar harsher notes of the\r\n     Wilson's snipe. When in a flock of its own kind, alert and on the\r\n     move, it has a short, snappy flocking note, a chorus of _tcheps_ or\r\n     _chips_. To my ear its flushing note is more or less a combination\r\n     of flight note and flocking note, and it may reasonably be so. The\r\n     flocking note communicates alertness to near-by members of a flock;\r\n     the flight note is used more emphatically by birds separated from\r\n     their companions or in active flight and disposed for\r\n     companionship, whereas on being flushed the bird is signaling to\r\n     possible companions; but as it has been feeding singly, concealed\r\n     from such others as there may be by the grass, their distance is\r\n     uncertain.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The pale-gray, almost white, tail with its dark, almost\r\nblack, center and rump, is conspicuous in flight; a pale stripe in the\r\nwing is less noticeable. The snipelike colors of the upper parts, the\r\ndark, heavily streaked breast, contrasted sharply with the white under\r\nparts, and the short olive-yellow legs are good field marks when the\r\nbird is standing. The males are much larger than the females, which is\r\nunusual among shore birds.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Regarding their departure from their breeding grounds, Murdoch\r\n(1885) says:\r\n\r\n     After the breeding season, they keep very quiet and retired, like\r\n     the rest of the waders, and the adults appear to slip quietly away\r\n     without collecting into flocks, as soon as the young are able to\r\n     take care of themselves. As soon as the young have assumed the\r\n     complete fall plumage, that is about the 10th of August, they\r\n     gather in large flocks with the other young waders, especially\r\n     about the small ponds on the high land below Cape Smythe, and stay\r\n     for several days before they take their departure for the South.\r\n     Stray birds remain as late as the first week of September.\r\n\r\nOn the New England coast the pectoral is both an early and a late\r\nmigrant; a few adults sometimes appear in July and more come in August;\r\nbut the main flight, mostly young birds, comes in September and October;\r\nthey are often abundant in the latter month and I have seen them as late\r\nas October 31. When with us it is seldom seen on the sandy flats or\r\nbeaches, but frequents the wet, fresh and salt meadows, preferably where\r\nthe grass has been cut and which after a rain are covered with shallow\r\npools of water. Here and along the margins of marshy creeks are its\r\nfavorite feeding grounds. It does not decoy well and is no longer\r\nconsidered a game bird, but it has been popular with sportsmen for its\r\ngamy qualities and for the excellence of its flesh.\r\n\r\nThere is a marked southeastward trend in the fall migration of this\r\nspecies; from its breeding grounds in northern Alaska and northeastern\r\nSiberia its main flight seems to be towards the Atlantic coast of the\r\nUnited States; it is not abundant and rather irregular on the Pacific\r\ncoast south of Alaska; it is common at times in the interior of Canada\r\nand usually abundant in New England. It occasionally occurs in enormous\r\nnumbers in Bermuda and seems to be always rare in Florida; these facts\r\nwould seem to indicate an ocean route to South America.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--The winter home of the pectoral sandpiper is in southern\r\nSouth America. Arthur H. Holland (1891) says that in the Argentine\r\nRepublic, it is \"usually found in marshy land with long water weeds\r\nabounding, frequenting the same spot for weeks together.\" Between\r\nSeptember and March 26, Doctor Wetmore (1926) recorded it as \"fairly\r\ncommon\" at various places in Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay. It\r\nevidently spends over half the year in its winter home and makes very\r\nrapid flights to and from its Arctic breeding grounds, where it makes a\r\nshort visit of about two months.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Northeastern Siberia, and North and South America; accidental\r\nin the Hawaiian Islands and the British Isles.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The pectoral sandpiper breeds mainly on the Arctic\r\ncoasts of Alaska and Mackenzie.

Observed in Labrador, Rigolet, June 24 to July 8, 1882, and Davis\r\nInlet, July 18, 1883. In Europe it has apparently been detected only in\r\nthe British Isles, where there are several records from Scotland and\r\nIreland and the southern counties of England.\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Alaska: 16 records, May 27 to July 3; 8 records, June 2 to\r\n18.

The species was fairly common on March 3 and\r\n     increased greatly in abundance on the two days that followed. The\r\n     northward journey was apparently as concerted as the movement that\r\n     carried the birds southward, as on March 6 there was a noticeable\r\n     decrease in their numbers, and by March 8, though the birds were\r\n     still common, the bulk of individuals had passed. They arrived in\r\n     flocks from the southward, often of several hundred individuals,\r\n     that whirled in and circled back and forth along the lake shore to\r\n     decoy to birds feeding on the strand or to rise again and continue\r\n     swiftly northward. Those that paused kept up a busy search for food\r\n     along the muddy beaches in or near shallow water, or in company\r\n     with little parties of buff-breasted sandpipers on the drier\r\n     alkaline flats back of the shore line. In early morning they were\r\n     especially active and were in continual movement. Occasionally they\r\n     worked out into comparatively deep water where in feeding it is\r\n     necessary to immerse the head over the eyes nearly to the ear\r\n     openings. When disturbed flocks rose with soft notes that resembled\r\n     _tseet tseet_ or _tseup_ to circle to new feeding grounds on the\r\n     lake shore.\r\n\r\nThe spring migration route is apparently northward along the Atlantic\r\ncoast of South America and through the West Indies to the United States.\r\nOnly a few migrate along our Atlantic coast, as the main flight is\r\nnorthward through the interior, during May and the first few days of\r\nJune. Many reach their breeding grounds before the end of May.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Doctor Wetmore (1926) gives an attractive account of what\r\nseems to be a beginning of courtship in Argentina; he writes:\r\n\r\n     Occasional parties of males, animated by the approaching breeding\r\n     season, broke into soft songs and called and twittered, often for\r\n     several minutes, in a musical chorus in low tones that had so\r\n     little carrying power that they merged in the strong wind, and it\r\n     was some time before I succeeded in picking out the sweet\r\n     individual songs _tsep a tsep a tsep a_ or _twee twee tee tee ty\r\n     tee_ given as the head was bobbed rapidly up and down. Occasionally\r\n     when the fall sunlight came warmly I sat in the mud and let little\r\n     bands of white rumps work up around me until they were feeding and\r\n     calling within a meter or so, eyeing me sharply for any cause of\r\n     alarm. At such times their twittering choruses came sweetly and\r\n     pleasantly, clearly audible above the lap of waves and the rush of\r\n     the inevitable winds of the pampas. Between songs the search for\r\n     food continued without cessation. At short intervals, activated by\r\n     the warmth of the sun, they suddenly indulged in dozens of combats\r\n     with their fellows, bloodless affrays, of bluff and retreat, where\r\n     they lowered their heads and with open mouths ran at one another\r\n     pugnaciously. The one attacked sidled quickly away or fluttered off\r\n     for a short distance, save where two of equal temperament chanced\r\n     to clash when first one and then the other threatened with raised\r\n     wings in alternate advance and retreat until the fray was concluded\r\n     to their mutual satisfaction. At such times the movements of these\r\n     otherwise plain little birds were sprightly and vivacious to a\r\n     degree. Their loquacity at this season was marked as it contrasted\r\n     strikingly with their silence and quiet during the resting period\r\n     of southern summer. Flocks frequently rose to perform intricate\r\n     evolutions and then returned with a rush to sweep along the shore\r\n     and join less ambitious comrades. As they passed the white rump\r\n     flashed plainly, certain advertisement of the species. At times the\r\n     chattering of these active flocks reminded me of the twittering of\r\n     swallows.\r\n\r\nJ. Dewey Soper found this species quite common at various places on\r\nBaffin Island, and has sent me some very full notes on it, from which I\r\nquote as follows:\r\n\r\n     The species was encountered at Nettilling Lake, June 10, 1925, when\r\n     a mated pair was flushed from a marshy upland near the Takuirbing\r\n     River. The sexual organs in both were fully developed, the female\r\n     being almost on the point of laying. By the 14th the species had\r\n     become quite common. The males practised their vocal performance on\r\n     the wing immediately upon arrival. They rise to a height of about\r\n     60 feet above the tundra and there they hover with rapidly beating\r\n     wings giving utterance to their nuptial song in notes so weak that\r\n     when a wind is blowing nothing may be heard of it even at\r\n     comparatively close range. It is given in a very low tone and slow\r\n     tempo; the notes are weak and inclined to be squeaky, with a weird\r\n     dripping quality like the sound of water oozing and dropping in a\r\n     small cavern. The species appears to flush silently.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Very little seems to be known and still less has been\r\npublished about the nesting habits of the white-rumped sandpiper. In\r\nMacFarlane's notes I find brief records of seven nests found by his\r\nparty on the barren grounds and Arctic coast of Canada, from 1862 to\r\n1865. One nest was found on June 21, 1862, 50 miles east of Fort\r\nAnderson; the female and three eggs were taken; the nest consisted of a\r\nfew leaves in a small hole in the ground near a small lake. Another\r\nfound on June 29, 1863, on the barren grounds, is described as \"a mere\r\ndepression in the ground lined with a few decayed leaves\"; the female\r\nand four eggs were taken. There is a set of four eggs in the Herbert\r\nMassey collection, taken with the parent bird by E. A. McIllhenny at\r\nPoint Barrow, Alaska, on June 25, 1898; the nest is described as \"a\r\nhollow in the moss on top of a ridge on the tundra, lined with dry grass\r\nand partly arched over.\" This is farther west than the species is\r\nsupposed to breed, but there are several birds in the Philadelphia\r\nAcademy of Sciences collected there in June, which are in full breeding\r\nplumage.\r\n\r\nMr. Soper found a number of nests near Nettilling Lake, Baffin Island,\r\non which he has sent me the following notes:\r\n\r\n     A nest containing four eggs was found on a grassy hummock on the\r\n     tundra bordering the lake on June 16. Many were subsequently found.\r\n     The nest is merely a shallow depression on the crown of a tussock\r\n     of grass and mosses a few inches above the surrounding mud and\r\n     water of the tundra. It is sparingly lined with blades of old grass\r\n     and dead leaves of the dwarf arctic willow. Some are lined\r\n     exclusively with the dried, oval leaves of _Salix herbacea_.\r\n     According to collecting data, both sexes arrive together, with the\r\n     female almost, if not quite, ready for immediate reproduction, as\r\n     evidenced by the condition of the ovaries. The nest of four eggs\r\n     found on June 16 was but four days after the first observed\r\n     arrivals of the species.\r\n\r\n     The female upon one's approach plays the familiar artifice of\r\n     simulating a prostrated condition, limping and dragging herself\r\n     along the ground in an effort to attract one's attention from the\r\n     nest. In this they are bold and fearless; and when one sits beside\r\n     the nest they will frequently run up to within a foot or less of\r\n     the observer. In photographing nests from a distance of only a few\r\n     feet, the female will often return to her eggs while one's head is\r\n     under the dark cloth adjusting the focus. One was so devoted to\r\n     her eggs that she would run up and peck at my fingers and run over\r\n     my hand as I extended it toward the nest. This species, when one\r\n     approaches the nest, usually leaves it when one is 20 to 25 yards\r\n     distant and runs along the ground, either directly toward the\r\n     intruder or a little to one side. Because of its remarkable\r\n     similarity to the covering of the tundra at this time, this first\r\n     movement often escapes one, and consequently when the bird is\r\n     first observed fluttering along the ground one naturally imagines\r\n     himself near the nest, when, in reality, it may be 20 or 30 yards\r\n     away. This ruse is a clever one, and no doubt would often save the\r\n     nest from violation. The nests are easily found by retiring and\r\n     watching the female with the glasses. They usually return to the\r\n     nest with little artifice or delay; in fact, often within two or\r\n     three minutes. The above procedure is not an invariable practice,\r\n     as one female I knew would flush directly from the nest to begin\r\n     her tactics only when there was danger of the nest being actually\r\n     trodden upon.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The four eggs usually laid by the white-rumped sandpiper are\r\novate pyriform in shape; all that I have seen are uniform in shape and\r\nhave characteristic colors and markings. One of the two sets in the\r\nUnited States National Museum has a \"deep olive buff\" ground color, and\r\nthe eggs are heavily blotched about the larger end, sparingly spotted\r\nelsewhere with \"wood brown,\" \"warm sepia,\" and \"benzo brown,\" and with a\r\nfew underlying spots of various shades of \"brownish drab\"; an egg from\r\nthis set is well figured by Frank Poynting (1895). The other set differs\r\nfrom this one in having the ground color lighter, \"olive buff,\" and the\r\nspots finer, more scrawly, and lighter in color; the underlying drab\r\nmarkings are also more numerous.\r\n\r\nThere is also a set of four eggs in the Thayer collection, taken with\r\nthe parent bird by Alfred H. Anderson on Taylor Island, Victoria Land,\r\nJuly 7, 1919. These eggs are much like the egg figured by Mr. Poynting,\r\nexcept that in one or two of the eggs the ground color is more greenish.\r\n\r\nOne of the three sets taken by J. Dewey Soper on Baffin Island looks\r\nmuch like a miniature set of long-billed curlew's eggs. In three of the\r\neggs the ground color is \"mignonette green,\" covered with small spots,\r\nmore thickly at the larger end, of \"bister\" and \"snuff brown\"; the other\r\nhas a \"deep lichen green\" ground color and is irregularly blotched near\r\nthe larger end, finely speckled elsewhere with \"bister\" and \"brownish\r\ndrab.\"\r\n\r\nThe measurements of 34 eggs average 33.7 by 24 millimeters; the eggs\r\nshowing the four extremes measure =36.1= by 23.6, 34.2 by =27.7=, =31.5=\r\nby 23.5, and 35 by =22.8= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Mr. Soper's notes on the young are as follows:\r\n\r\n     The first juveniles, about a day old, were seen and collected on\r\n     July 11. They were exceedingly active, a good example of precocial\r\n     young. These were ashy below, buffy above, with black markings, and\r\n     the down over the lower back and rump tipped with small spots of\r\n     white. This species is much more demonstrative and less artful in\r\n     the concealment of young than Baird's sandpiper. The adults come\r\n     within a few feet of the intruder, and by their action advertise\r\n     much more clearly the position of the young. The parent birds keep\r\n     up a continual fine twittering cry of alarm, the female louder and\r\n     more pronounced. The male comes on the scene only at intervals with\r\n     a mouse-like squeaking note. The young are adepts in the art of\r\n     concealment, \"freezing\" flat to the ground with warning notes from\r\n     the adults. They will lie in this fashion as though dead until\r\n     actually picked up in the hand. When they realize the game is up\r\n     they then become wild and frantically struggle to escape. When\r\n     allowed to do so they will run rapidly away and either hide again\r\n     or attempt to reach the mother bird, whose frantic cries come from\r\n     but a few yards away.\r\n\r\n     A young white rump about two-thirds grown and almost on the point\r\n     of flight was captured on August 1. Others seen a few days later on\r\n     the shore of Kuksunittuk Bay were capable of short flights. As an\r\n     experiment, I tried several times to keep individual young alive at\r\n     my base tent on the Takuirbing River, but they invariably died\r\n     within about 24 hours regardless of the best care.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy young white rumped is much like the downy young\r\nof other tundra nesting species of sandpipers. From the stilt sandpiper\r\nit can be distinguished by its much shorter legs and shorter and\r\nslenderer bill, from the Baird by its more buffy face and breast, these\r\nparts being pure white in _bairdi_, and from the least by paler and\r\nduller browns in the upper parts and by white, instead of buffy terminal\r\ntuft spots. The crown, back, rump, wings, and thighs are variegated or\r\nmarbled with \"Sanford's brown,\" or \"tawny,\" and black, dotted, except on\r\nthe front half of the crown, which is mainly bright brown, with whitish\r\nterminal tufts. The forehead, a broad superciliary stripe, the sides of\r\nthe head, throat, and breast are pale buff or buffy white; the remaining\r\nunder parts are grayish white. A median frontal stripe of black\r\nterminates in \"tawny\" toward the bill; there are extensive black areas\r\non either side of the crown and on the occiput. The nape is grizzly,\r\nbuff, gray and dusky.\r\n\r\nIn juvenal plumage the crown is sepia with \"tawny\" edgings; the back,\r\nrump, tertials, and scapulars are sepia, with \"tawny\" edges, and some of\r\nthe feathers of the mantle and scapulars are also white tipped; the\r\nunder parts are white, but the breast is suffused with light buff and\r\nnarrowly streaked with dusky; the median and lesser wing coverts are\r\nbroadly edged with light buff or whitish.\r\n\r\nThe postjuvenal molt of the body plumage usually occurs in September and\r\nOctober, mainly in the latter month, but sometimes not until November.\r\nThe upper body plumage is not all molted, so that first winter birds can\r\nbe distinguished by tawny or buffy edged feathers in the mantle and by\r\nthe juvenal wing coverts. The next partial prenuptial molt apparently\r\nremoves all traces of immaturity.\r\n\r\nAdults have a prenuptial molt, beginning in March, of the under-body\r\nplumage, most of the upper-body plumage, sometimes the tail, and some of\r\nthe wing coverts. But this is almost immediately preceded by the delayed\r\nmolt of the remiges in January and February, so that it seems to be a\r\nnearly complete prenuptial molt, which is barely finished before the\r\nbirds start on their long northward migration. The postnuptial molt of\r\nadults, beginning in August and often lasting into October, involves\r\nonly the body plumage, the tail, and some scapulars, tertials, and wing\r\ncoverts. The gray winter plumage, so different from the brightly colored\r\nspring plumage, is seldom seen in its completeness before the birds go\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Very little seems to have been published on the food of the\r\nwhite-rumped sandpiper, but W. L. McAtee (1911) gives it credit for\r\neating some injurious insects and worms, such as grasshoppers, the\r\nclover-root curculio, which is injurious to clover, and marine worms\r\n(_Nereis_), which prey on oysters.\r\n\r\nStuart T. Danforth (1925) says that four collected in Porto Rico--\r\n\r\n     had eaten 77.7 per cent of animal food and 22.3 per cent of\r\n     vegetable matter. Fifty per cent of the animal matter consisted of\r\n     bloodworms, 25 per cent of Planorbis snails, and 5 per cent of\r\n     _Corixa reticulata_. The vegetable matter consisted entirely of\r\n     seeds, of which those of Compositae formed 33.3 per cent, _Sesban\r\n     emerus_ 30 per cent, and _Persicaria portoricensis_ 36.7 per cent.\r\n     In addition to food, the stomachs contained mineral matter (coarse\r\n     red sand) forming 32.5 per cent of the stomach contents.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Lucien M. Turner, who has had abundant opportunity to\r\nobserve this species in Ungava, writes in his notes:\r\n\r\n     The flight of these birds is remarkably firm and swift, generally\r\n     in an undulatory manner and swerving to the right or left often\r\n     with the body inclined to one side, the wing nearly perpendicular,\r\n     alternately presenting the upper and lower surface of the body.\r\n     Just before alighting the wings are raised until the tips nearly\r\n     touch over the back and for a moment held outstretched and then\r\n     slowly folded. The bird is quite active while searching for food\r\n     and seldom remains more than a few seconds in a spot, where it\r\n     constantly picks here and there for the minute organisms which form\r\n     its food. During this time all is activity and quite in contrast to\r\n     the interval while the tide is high and the bird is on the high\r\n     land resting and digesting its food. Here it is more sleepy and\r\n     less easily disturbed. The eyesight of these sandpipers is\r\n     certainly very acute, as they are able to detect the presence of a\r\n     person at a long distance and give a twittering, snipey note,\r\n     otherwise regardless of approaching danger. In all their doings the\r\n     utmost harmony seems to prevail. The only object of their lives\r\n     seems to be to gather food. No sooner does the water begin to ebb\r\n     than a few of these birds will swish over some point of land with\r\n     merry twittering, eagerly scanning the bank for the least\r\n     appearance of mud now being exposed. By the time the tide has half\r\n     ebbed myriads of these birds are sweeping back and forth along the\r\n     river. As the water shallows over well known bars, and scarcely has\r\n     the water shoaled enough to permit the birds to alight without\r\n     swimming, than as many sandpipers as can collect on the place\r\n     eagerly alight and begin probing the ooze for food. The lowering\r\n     water is followed by the thronging birds to the last inch.\r\n\r\n     The flowing tide begins and the birds retreat carefully seizing\r\n     every object of food that the rising water brings to the surface.\r\n     Often they are so eager in their search that many birds are\r\n     crowded into the deeper water and save themselves only by flight.\r\n     This or that place is quickly covered over by the water and again\r\n     the birds collect into larger flocks which now sway to the right\r\n     or left, alternately, exposing their silvery white underparts\r\n     which gleam in the sunshine like a stream of silver. The gray or\r\n     brown of their backs relieving the color as the long stream of\r\n     birds pass by. They partially halt their flight and become a\r\n     compact flock, whereupon they separate into smaller flocks which,\r\n     as the water gradually rises and covers their feeding grounds, now\r\n     betake themselves to the higher lands of the banks above. Here,\r\n     around the pools on the highlands, or among the grassy margins of\r\n     the lakes, they collect to wash themselves and digest the food\r\n     they have obtained from the salt-water mud.\r\n\r\n     As a person approaches one of these pools, in the latter part of\r\n     August, little suspecting that anything will be found near them,\r\n     these birds turn their backs, which so closely resemble the lichen\r\n     covered granite as to render the birds indistinguishable. A nearer\r\n     approach and they present their white breasts which afford a\r\n     striking contrast with the surroundings. In a moment they run\r\n     together and huddle into a compact flock before they take wing. I\r\n     have, by firing at the proper moment, secured every individual\r\n     composing a flock of over a dozen birds. If they fly they take to\r\n     their wings with a sudden impulse and fly in a zigzag movement for\r\n     a few yards then swerve to right or left continuing until another\r\n     locality is reached, where they sit quietly until approached. This\r\n     is repeated every tide and, as the birds are crepuscular also in\r\n     their habits, their opportunities for becoming fat are nearly\r\n     doubled. They acquire the fat in a short time. The thickness of the\r\n     layer is often one-fourth of an inch and completely envelops the\r\n     body. The least abrasion of the skin or a shot hole soon fills the\r\n     surrounding parts with oil which has exuded from the wound, making\r\n     the preparation of skins for specimens a very difficult matter. The\r\n     flesh of these birds is peculiarly tender and richly flavored. At\r\n     times I have gone out to shoot these birds for the table and with\r\n     five discharges (of half an ounce of No. 12 shot) I secured on one\r\n     occasion 82 birds. A heavy stick thrown in among them as they wade\r\n     along the water's edge also knocks many of them over, for these\r\n     birds seem so intent on procuring food that but little heed is\r\n     given to the hunter.\r\n\r\nWilliam Brewster (1925) says:\r\n\r\n     Invariably among the tamest and most confiding of our so-called\r\n     shore birds, they will usually permit one to approach, either on\r\n     foot or in a boat, within 5 or 6 yards, while I have known a gun to\r\n     be discharged into a flock with fatal effect, but without causing\r\n     any of the birds which escaped injury to take wing. Like most obese\r\n     creatures they are habitually sluggish, confining their wanderings\r\n     afoot to limited areas, and exploiting these very deliberately,\r\n     walking slowly and sedately in crouching attitudes, with measured\r\n     steps, frequently stopping to thrust their bills listlessly a\r\n     little way into the soft ground, or to pick up small morsels of\r\n     food from the surface. Occasionally, however, one may see them\r\n     running to and fro over the mud quite briskly and ceaselessly,\r\n     perhaps incited to this comparatively unusual behavior by the\r\n     example of other waders feeding close about them, for they are by\r\n     no means averse to the companionship of several of the lesser\r\n     kinds, such as semipalmated plover and sandpipers, grass-birds,\r\n     dunlins, etc. Although somewhat loath to take wing, even when\r\n     threatened by obvious danger, they are likely to fly swiftly and\r\n     far, when once started, doubling and circling over the marshes in\r\n     much the same manner as other small sandpipers.\r\n\r\nJohn T. Nichols, says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     When startled, a bird has been seen to crouch down concealing the\r\n     bulk of its white underparts and practically disappear against the\r\n     brightly lighted mud flat on which it had been feeding. This is a\r\n     habit shared by its close relatives the pectoral and least\r\n     sandpipers.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The white-rumped sandpiper is ordinarily a rather silent bird,\r\nbut its short, sharp flight note is characteristic of the species and\r\nserves to distinguish it readily in the field. To me it sounds like\r\n_tzeep_ or _tzip_; Mr. Nichols calls it \"a squeaky mouse-like _jeet_\";\r\nMr. Brewster (1925) describes it as \"a feeble lisping _zip_ or _tsip_,\r\nfringilline, rather than limicoline, in character\"; and Doctor Townsend\r\n(1905) thinks that \"it suggests at times the call note of the pipit.\" C.\r\nJ. Maynard (1896) refers to \"one cry in particular, being loudly given\r\nand greatly prolonged, resembling the scream of a rapacious bird more\r\nthan the whistle of a sandpiper.\"\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The best field mark for this species is the white rump,\r\nor rather upper tail-coverts; this is conspicuous in flight but is\r\nusually concealed by the wings when the bird is on the ground. I have\r\nnoticed that, while the bird is standing with its side toward me, the\r\ngray of the upper parts extend down on the sides of the neck as far as\r\nthe bend of the wing, whereas in the semipalmated sandpiper, with which\r\nit might be confused, there is a decided white space in front of the\r\nwing.\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     This bird is a size larger than least or semipalmated sandpipers,\r\n     and at favorable angles shows a diagnostic white patch crossing\r\n     above the rather dark tail. This white patch is a good example of\r\n     color which apparently functions as a recognition mark. If the same\r\n     were fortuitous one would not expect the tail to be darker than in\r\n     related species, as is the case, causing the white rump to show\r\n     more prominently. Straight bill, (or with slight decurviture at the\r\n     tip, like that of the pectoral sandpiper) and as a rule finely and\r\n     sharply streaked head and breast prevent chance of confusion with\r\n     the European curlew sandpiper, of casual occurrence on our Atlantic\r\n     coast.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--The beginning of the fall flight is apparently southeastward\r\nfrom its breeding grounds west of Hudson Bay and perhaps southward from\r\nBaffin Island, where it breeds. Mr. Turner's Ungava notes give a very\r\ngood idea of this first step in the migration and a good impression of\r\nthe great abundance of this species; he writes:\r\n\r\n     As I proceeded farther northward I did not observe a single one of\r\n     these sandpipers until we came to anchor off the mouth of Georges\r\n     River (July 31) where quite a number were seen on the pebbly beach,\r\n     seeking their food among the rocks and shingle as the tide receded.\r\n     At this date quite a number, in fact fully three-fourths, of those\r\n     seen were birds of the year as was fully attested by traces of\r\n     downy plumage yet among the feathers of the body and especially on\r\n     the head and neck. The sizes of the flocks varied from three or\r\n     four to nearly a dozen, doubtless consisting of a single brood or,\r\n     in the case of the larger flocks, of two or more broods with their\r\n     parents. Some of the younger members of the flocks had the wing\r\n     quills not fully developed while others were considerably farther\r\n     advanced. Such a variation of plumage both in age and coloration\r\n     was exhibited that I presumed there must be two weeks difference in\r\n     the ages of the different young.\r\n\r\n     By the 10th of August all the young are well able to fly and make\r\n     protracted flights in search of food. By this date they assemble in\r\n     flocks, amounting at times, to thousands of individuals, resorting\r\n     to the mud flats left bare by the receding tide. The mouth of the\r\n     Koksoak and the cove to the westward of it present excellent tracts\r\n     of mud deposited in the little indentations. By the middle of\r\n     September these birds begin to depart to the south. Many of them\r\n     ascended the Koksoak and others doubtless followed the windings of\r\n     the coast down the Atlantic. I have seen numerous flocks over a\r\n     hundred miles from the mouth of the river as late as October 12th,\r\n     and an occasional single bird as late as the 20th of that month. I\r\n     have observed, at the mouth of the Koksoak River, flocks of these\r\n     birds often numbering over a hundred individuals suddenly appear\r\n     from high in the air. These I suspected to be birds coming from the\r\n     regions to the northward of the strait for they always came from\r\n     the sea.\r\n\r\nThence there is an overland flight to the Atlantic coast. Mr. Brewster\r\n(1925) says:\r\n\r\n     White-rumped sandpipers visit Lake Umbagog regularly and not\r\n     infrequently, if rather sparingly, in autumn, appearing oftenest\r\n     during the month of October. Those arriving early in the season are\r\n     mostly adult birds which occur singly or two or three together;\r\n     those coming later are of various ages and sometimes in flocks\r\n     containing as many as eight or nine members each, but rarely, if\r\n     ever, a greater number. Bonaparte's sandpipers are hardy birds.\r\n     They may be seen at the lake when its bordering marshes are stiff\r\n     with frost. Once (October 26, 1883) I found nine of them near the\r\n     mouth of Cambridge River two days after the entire region had been\r\n     covered with snow to a depth of 7 inches.\r\n\r\nThis bird is a regular, but never an abundant, migrant on the coast of\r\nMassachusetts in the fall. The vast numbers which Turner saw in Ungava\r\nmust seek some other route; the species is never abundant in the\r\ninterior in the fall and it seems to be rather rare on the Atlantic\r\ncoast south of New England; the natural inference is that it migrates at\r\nsea from Maine or Nova Scotia directly to South America or the West\r\nIndies. It is abundant at times in Bermuda.\r\n\r\nThe adults begin to reach Cape Cod in August, but the main flight comes\r\nin September, consisting partially of young birds; most of the young\r\nbirds come in October and some linger as late as November 10. While with\r\nus the white-rumped sandpiper frequents the wet meadows and marshes near\r\nthe shore, as well as the sand flats, mud flats, and beaches, feeding at\r\nlow tide singly or in small flocks and usually associated with pectoral,\r\nsemipalmated, or least sandpipers. During high tides, while the flats\r\nare covered, this species may be seen on the high sandy beaches, mixed\r\nin with the vast flocks of small shorebirds, sleeping, or resting, or\r\npreening their plumage, while waiting for feeding time to come again; if\r\nthe wind is blowing, all the birds are facing it; many are crouching on\r\nthe sand and others are standing on one leg with the bill tucked under\r\nthe scapulars. These flocks often contain hundreds and sometimes\r\nthousands of birds, mainly semipalmated sandpipers, semipalmated\r\nplover, and sanderlings. They are not all asleep, however, for if\r\napproached too closely, they all rise and whirl away in a vast\r\nshimmering cloud, flashing now white and now dark as they turn, and\r\nsettle on the beach again at no great distance.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--August finds the white-rumped sandpiper migrating along the\r\ncoast of Brazil and it has been known to reach Cape Horn as early as\r\nSeptember 9. Doctor Wetmore (1926) writes:\r\n\r\n     The white-rumped sandpiper was the most abundant of the migrant\r\n     shore birds in the regions visited in southern South America. The\r\n     species was not recorded until September 6, 1920, when it appeared\r\n     in abundance in southward migration on the lagoons at kilometer 80,\r\n     west of Puerto Pinasco, Paraguay. The first flocks from which\r\n     specimens were taken were adult females, and two taken on the date\r\n     when they were first recorded had laid eggs a few weeks previous as\r\n     was shown by the appearance of the ovaries. The southward migration\r\n     came with a rush as the birds passed through the night as witnessed\r\n     by their calls. The flight continued until September 21, when a\r\n     dozen, the last seen here, were recorded. The birds circled about\r\n     lagoons in small compact flocks or walked along on muddy shores,\r\n     where they fed with head down, probing rapidly in the soft mud;\r\n     anything edible encountered was seized and swallowed and the bird\r\n     continued without delay in its search for more.\r\n\r\n     Farther south this species was encountered in abundance in its\r\n     winter range on the pampa. Ten were recorded at Dolores, Buenos\r\n     Aires, October 21, and from October 22 to November 15 the species\r\n     was found in numbers on the coastal mud flats on the Bay of\r\n     Samborombom. A few were seen at pools of water in the sand dunes\r\n     below Cape San Antonio. Along the Rio Ajo white-rumped sandpipers\r\n     were encountered in flocks of hundreds that came upstream to\r\n     search the mud flats at low tide or were concentrated on bars at\r\n     the mouth when the water was high. In early morning there was a\r\n     steady flight of them passing to suitable feeding grounds. The\r\n     birds flew swiftly, with soft notes, from 3 to 15 feet from the\r\n     earth. In feeding they scattered out in little groups that covered\r\n     the bare mud systematically. It was not unusual to record as many\r\n     as 2,000 in a day. About two hundred were observed in the bay at\r\n     Ingeniero White, the port of Bahia Blanca, on December 13, and at\r\n     Carhue, Buenos Aires, from December 16 to 18, white-rumped\r\n     sandpipers were noted in fair numbers on inundated ground back of\r\n     the shore of Lake Epiquen or about fresh-water ponds on the pampa\r\n     inland. None were found in Uruguay during February.\r\n\r\nErnest Gibson (1920) says of this species, at Cape San Antonio, Buenos\r\nAires:\r\n\r\n     This is certainly our commonest wader, and is found everywhere in\r\n     flocks, from, say, the end of October to the middle or end of\r\n     March. The number in these gatherings is only restricted by the\r\n     area of the feeding ground; hence, when large mud flats are\r\n     available in the vicinity of our fresh or salt water lagunas and\r\n     cangrejales, or at the subsidence of a flood, the flocks are\r\n     sometimes of enormous size. The observer may see many acres of\r\n     ground which look to be in continuous movement, the surface being\r\n     alive with the restless throng of sandpipers running about and\r\n     chasing each other, feeding, or taking constant short flights.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North and South America; casual in Europe.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--Although the white-rumped sandpiper has been noted in\r\nsummer from Wainwright, Alaska, east to southern Greenland\r\n(Julianshaab), the only places where eggs have been taken are Point\r\nBarrow, Alaska; Herschel Island, Yukon; Taylor Island, Victoria Land;\r\nFort Anderson and Rendezvous Lake, Mackenzie; and the southeast shore of\r\nLake Nettilling, Baffin Island.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--North to Paraguay (Rio Pilcomayo and Rio Parana); and\r\nUruguay (Montevideo).

Specimens are in the British Museum from\r\nLion Hill, Panama; Momotombo, Nicaragua; and Tizimin and Cozumel Island,\r\nMexico. It also has been observed or taken on the islands of Barbados\r\n(September 20 and 22, year?); Dominica (November 5, 1904); St. Lucia;\r\nGuadeloupe; Martinique; Trinidad; Porto Rico (Mayaguez, October 2, 1900,\r\nand Culebrita, April 15, 1912); Cuba; the Bahamas (Inagua, May 27, 1879,\r\nand Fortune Island, August 5, 1876); and the Bermuda Islands. Examples\r\nwere reported from the Yellowstone River, Montana, August 8 to 13, 1878;\r\nit has been taken at Laramie, Wyo.; in New Mexico (Fort Fillmore,\r\nOctober, 1852, and Zuni Mountains, September 16, 1851); and there are\r\nseveral records for eastern Colorado. The specimen reported from\r\nOakland, Calif., was probably the Pectoral sandpiper, _P. maculata_. One\r\nwas taken at Hopedale, Labrador.\r\n\r\nWhite-rumped sandpipers have been reported in the British Isles fourteen\r\nor fifteen times and a specimen was taken in Franz Josef Land on June 28\r\n(year unknown, but prior to 1898).\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Arctic Canada: 14 records, June 15 to July 24; 7 records,\r\nJune 30 to July 12. Alaska: 2 records, June 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nPISOBIA BAIRDI (Coues)\r\n\r\nBAIRD SANDPIPER\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\n_Spring._--This sandpiper belongs to that class of birds which Abel\r\nChapman (1924) so aptly terms \"globe spanners,\" for on its migrations\r\nits traverses the whole length of both American continents twice a year.\r\nFrom its wintering grounds in Patagonia it must start north even earlier\r\nthan the preceding species or else it must travel faster. Dr. Alexander\r\nWetmore (1926) observed it migrating past Buenos Aires on March 5 in\r\ncompany with white-rumped sandpipers, and it has been known to reach\r\nTexas early in March. From there its course seems to be northward\r\nbetween the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. A.G. Lawrence\r\ntells me that it passes through Manitoba between April 28 and May 29;\r\nand J.A. Munro gives me, as his spring dates for southern British\r\nColumbia, April 30 to May 10. Prof. William Rowan (Mss.) calls it\r\nextremely abundant in Alberta about the middle of May and usually gone\r\nby the 24th. It is very rare east of the Mississippi in the spring. E.A.\r\nPreble (1908) saw large flocks foraging on floating ice at Lake\r\nAthabaska on May 25. Dr. Joseph Grinnell (1900) records it at the Kowak\r\nRiver, Alaska, on May 20. Joseph Dixon (1917) says:\r\n\r\n     On May 31, 1914, at Griffin Point, Arctic Alaska, the first pair of\r\n     Baird sandpipers for the season were noted feeding along the rim of\r\n     a frozen tundra pond. The weather had turned bitterly cold during\r\n     the previous night, and as a result the newly formed ice on the\r\n     ponds was thick enough to support a man. Strictly speaking, there\r\n     was no night at this date, for the two months of continuous\r\n     daylight had already begun; so in a short time the sandpipers were\r\n     bustling about picking up the mosquito and other pupae which were\r\n     being washed out by a newly-born stream that gurgled under the snow\r\n     and ice on its way down to the frozen lagoon.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Two somewhat different accounts of the courtship of this\r\nspecies have been published. W. Sprague Brooks (1915), who found this\r\nbird breeding at Demarcation Point, Alaska, writes:\r\n\r\n     Only once did I note any courtship activity. On this occasion (May\r\n     24), the male would fly a few feet above the female, while she\r\n     rested on the ground, with quick erratic wing strokes suggesting a\r\n     nighthawk. Frequently he would alight and raise the wings high over\r\n     the back as a gull does before folding them. Then with the forearms\r\n     perpendicular, the primaries would be slowly raised and lowered\r\n     like a pump handle, generally lowered to right angles with the\r\n     forearms, sometimes lower. Not a sound was uttered.\r\n\r\nAlfred M. Bailey (1926), whose observations were made at Cape Prince of\r\nWales, Alaska, says:\r\n\r\n     Cutting down the opposite side of the ridge, I heard many calls\r\n     which reminded me of home in the early spring, for the combined\r\n     totals sounded like the singing of many little grass frogs in a\r\n     meadow pond. It was the call, or rather the \"spring song,\" of the\r\n     Baird sandpiper. I soon flushed a little female, which fluttered\r\n     away uttering cries of alarm. I concealed myself, and she soon\r\n     returned, the male also hovering about, making his little froglike\r\n     peep. At times he would rise high in the air, in the way so\r\n     characteristic of male sandpipers, give forth his song, and sail\r\n     down to perch.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--MacFarlane's notes mention seven nests found in the vicinity\r\nof Franklin Bay, but very few data were given; \"on June 24, 1864, a nest\r\ncontaining four eggs was found in the Barren Grounds, in a swampy tract\r\nbetween two small lakes, and was composed of a few decayed leaves placed\r\nin a small cavity or depression in the ground, shaded by a tuft of\r\ngrass.\" John Murdoch (1885) says:\r\n\r\n     The nest was always well hidden in the grass and never placed in\r\n     marshy ground or on the bare black parts of tundra, and consists\r\n     merely of a slight depression in the ground, thinly lined with\r\n     dried grass. All the eggs we found were obtained from the last week\r\n     in June to the first week of July, a trifle later than the other\r\n     waders. The sitting female when disturbed exhibits the greatest\r\n     solicitude, running about with drooping, outspread wings, and loud\r\n     outcry, and uses every possible wile to attract the intruder from\r\n     the eggs. The nest is so well concealed and forms so inconspicuous\r\n     an object that the only practical way to secure the eggs is to\r\n     withdraw to one side and allow the sitting bird to return,\r\n     carefully marking where she alights. Having done this on one\r\n     occasion and failing to find the eggs, after flushing the bird two\r\n     or three times I discovered that I had walked on the eggs, though I\r\n     had been looking for them most carefully.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooks (1915) writes:\r\n\r\n     Two nests were found, each containing four eggs and about one\r\n     quarter incubated on June 12 and 14, 1914. Murdoch found them\r\n     nesting rather later than other waders at Point Barrow, but my\r\n     experience at Demarcation Point was quite the opposite, for here\r\n     they were the first to breed. A female taken June 2, had a fully\r\n     formed and colored egg about ready to lay. Both of the above nests\r\n     were on dry, well-drained tundra near the bases of knolls. The\r\n     nests were like the other sandpipers, and lined with dry willow\r\n     leaves, but the cavities were less deep than those of the\r\n     semipalmated sandpiper.\r\n\r\n     The female was on one nest and the male on the other. The former\r\n     left the nest when I was some distance away and flying directly\r\n     toward me alighted within a few feet. While I was at the nest she\r\n     walked hurriedly about close by constantly uttering a plaintive\r\n     _weet-weet-weet_ always repeated three times. Occasionally she\r\n     would take a short flight about me and utter a note very similar\r\n     to the rattling call of the pectoral sandpiper. The male when\r\n     disturbed acted quite differently. He sat closer and on leaving\r\n     the nest showed the greatest concern, dragging a \"broken\" wing in\r\n     the most distressing manner. In neither case was the mate about as\r\n     frequently occurs with the semipalmated sandpiper.\r\n\r\nMr. Dixon (1917) says:\r\n\r\n     At Griffin Point, less than 50 miles to the eastward of Demarcation\r\n     Point, the first set of eggs (fresh) was taken on June 24. The last\r\n     set was found July 11, with the four eggs nearly ready to hatch.\r\n     Murdoch speaks of the nests being well concealed and always hidden\r\n     in the grass. In those nests which we found, no attempt had been\r\n     made at such concealment, as they were placed absolutely in the\r\n     open, with nothing to cover or conceal the eggs at all, and the\r\n     nests so shallow that the tops of the eggs were almost or quite\r\n     level with the surrounding grass. Far from being conspicuously\r\n     exposed thereby, however, the eggs were shielded from discovery in\r\n     the most effective manner possible, for in color and markings they\r\n     blended so perfectly with the brown tundra that a person could\r\n     easily look directly at them from a distance of 6 feet and still\r\n     not be able to see them.\r\n\r\n     This method of nesting seems to be the most effective way of\r\n     escaping one great danger at least, namely, the notice of the\r\n     countless jaegers, both parasitic and pomarine. These robbers\r\n     subsist almost entirely during the breeding period on the young\r\n     and eggs of other birds, and cruise continually back and forth\r\n     over the sandpipers' nesting ground, looking for the least\r\n     telltale feather, bit of wind-blown down, or other object which\r\n     might afford a clue to the whereabouts of a nest.\r\n\r\nHerbert W. Brandt found only one nest of the Baird sandpiper near Hooper\r\nBay, Alaska, which he tells me--\r\n\r\n     Was on a dry mossy ridge amid the dunes and was partially concealed\r\n     by the surrounding curly grass. It was flimsily constructed of\r\n     grass stems and filled with a scant handful of small leaves of the\r\n     dwarf birch and blueberry, together with a few adjacent\r\n     reindeer-moss stems. The measurements of this nest were: Inside\r\n     diameter 2-1/2 inches, and depth perhaps 2 inches.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The Baird sandpiper lays ordinarily four eggs, occasionally\r\nonly three. These vary in shape from ovate or ovate pyriform to\r\nsubovate, and they have a slight gloss. In color they often resemble\r\ncertain types of western sandpipers' eggs, as they are usually of a\r\ndecidedly reddish tone; but they are considerably larger. The ground\r\ncolor varies from \"pinkish buff\" to \"pale pinkish buff\" or from \"olive\r\nbuff\" to \"cartridge buff.\" Three quite different types are represented\r\nin my collection. In the western sandpiper type the \"pinkish buff\"\r\nground color is quite evenly covered over the whole egg with small,\r\nelongated spots, somewhat thicker at the larger end and having a spiral\r\ntendency, of \"Hay's russet\" and \"chestnut brown,\" with a few underlying\r\nspots of \"brownish drab.\" Another set has a \"cartridge buff\" ground\r\ncolor, which is unevenly covered, chiefly at the larger end, with small\r\nspots of duller browns, \"bister,\" \"Saccardo's umber,\" and light shades\r\nof \"brownish drab.\" This seems to be the commonest type. An unusually\r\nbeautiful set has a \"pinkish buff\" ground color, sparingly sprinkled\r\nwith minute brown dots and boldly blotched with great, irregular\r\nsplashes of deep, rich browns, \"chestnut,\" \"chocolate,\" and \"liver\r\nbrown,\" overlying large splashes of various shades of \"vinaceous gray.\"\r\nThe measurements of 54 eggs average 33.1 by 23.8 millimeters; the eggs\r\nshowing the four extremes measure =33.5= by 24.4, 34.3 by =24.6= and\r\n=30= by =22= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Incubation is shared by both sexes, but we have no data as to\r\nits duration. Mr. Dixon (1917) found the male bird covering the eggs\r\nmore often than the female, and others have reported finding the male\r\ncaring for the young. Mr. Dixon (1917) says of the young:\r\n\r\n     The young sandpipers were found feeding in the shallower pools,\r\n     where the water was less than 1 inch deep. At times as many as five\r\n     were noted in an area 1 yard square. They congregated along the\r\n     water's edge, picking up, as the tide slowly receded, many bits of\r\n     food. The nature of this provender I could not make out, although\r\n     the young birds would often come within 20 feet of me when I\r\n     remained motionless for a few minutes. The old birds were much more\r\n     shy, often taking flight or retreating to distant gravel bars upon\r\n     my approach. Considerable time was spent by both young and old in\r\n     making short flights about the harbor. These flights alternated\r\n     with periods of food getting, and were seemingly in preparation for\r\n     the fall migration. It was only a few days then until the bulk of\r\n     the species left on their southward journey.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy young Baird sandpiper is well colored to escape\r\ndetection on the brown tundra moss. The crown and upper parts are\r\nvariegated with black and \"tawny\" in an irregular pattern and dotted\r\nwith white terminal tufts; the crown is centrally \"tawny,\" with a median\r\nblack stripe, and is bordered with black; the forehead, back to eyes,\r\nsides of the head and all under parts are pure white; there is a black\r\nspot in the center of the forehead, a black stripe from the bill,\r\nthrough the eye, to the occiput and another below it and parallel to\r\nit; there is a white superciliary stripe and some white mottling on the\r\nback of the head and neck.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage is equally concealing. The crown is sepia with buffy\r\nedgings; the back and scapulars are dark sepia with broad white edgings;\r\nthe wing is like the adult except that the coverts and tertials are\r\nedged with \"pinkish buff\" and tipped with white; the under parts are\r\nlike the adult but the breast is more pinkish buff and more faintly\r\nstreaked. A partial postjuvenal molt, including most of the body plumage\r\nand some of the scapulars, wing coverts, and tertials and takes place in\r\nOctober or later. I have seen birds in full juvenal plumage as late as\r\nOctober 3; young birds migrate in this plumage. At the first prenuptial\r\nmolt the following spring young birds become indistinguishable from\r\nadults.\r\n\r\nAdults have a partial prenuptial molt in April and May, including only\r\npart of the body plumage. The postnuptial molt begins in July, when the\r\nbody plumage is molted before the birds migrate; the wings are molted\r\nafter the birds reach their winter home, from December to February, not\r\nlong before they started to migrate north again. I have seen birds in\r\nfull nuptial plumage as early as May 1 and as late as July 29, and in\r\nfull winter plumage as late as April 5. The adult nuptial and winter\r\nplumages are somewhat different; the colors are brighter and richer in\r\nthe spring and the markings are more distinct; in the fall the upper\r\nparts are nearly uniformly buffy brownish with dusky shaft streaks; the\r\nchest and sides of the breast are dull brownish buff and not distinctly\r\nstreaked.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Preble and McAtee (1923) found in the stomachs of three Baird\r\nsandpipers, taken on the Pribilof Islands, amphipods, algae, ground\r\nbeetles, and a weevil. Mr. McAtee (1911) includes this species among\r\nthose that eat mosquito larvae, crane-fly larvae, grasshoppers, and the\r\nclover-root curculio, all injurious insects. It feeds on the open mud\r\nflats with other species of sandpipers, but seems to prefer to feed\r\nabout the edges of the shallow inland pools or where the muddy flats are\r\npartially overgrown with grass. William Brewster (1925) watched some of\r\nthem feeding, of which he says:\r\n\r\n     On first noticing me draw near they stood erect, with upstretched\r\n     necks, regarding me intently and distrustfully, but their feeding\r\n     operations were resumed soon after I ceased to advance. By\r\n     successive runs, 8 or 10 feet in length and often executed very\r\n     swiftly, they moved about quickly in various directions over soft\r\n     mud or through shallow water, frequently stooping to pick up small\r\n     morsels of food, but not once using their bills for probing under\r\n     ground or water.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Dr. Charles W. Townsend (1905) says that the note, which he\r\nheard several times, seemed to him \"exactly like that of the\r\nsemipalmated sandpiper, a rather shrill, trilling whistle.\" Mr. Brewster\r\n(1925) says that--\r\n\r\n     the _kreep_ call they utter in flight is sufficiently unlike that\r\n     of any other wader of similar size and general coloring to be of\r\n     service as a means of field identification when the birds are seen\r\n     on wing. It is appreciably different from the call of any other\r\n     sandpiper known to me, although not so very unlike that of the\r\n     sanderling.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The Baird sandpiper is one of the most difficult of all\r\nthis group to recognize in the field, because it has no prominent\r\ndistinguishing field marks peculiar to itself. It has characters in\r\ncommon with any one of several small sandpipers. In color and general\r\nappearance it is most like the least sandpiper; it is decidedly larger,\r\nbut size is of little value unless the two are side by side for\r\ncomparison; it is lighter colored above, more extensively buffy on the\r\nbreast, and has darker legs. It is a size larger than the semipalmated\r\nand western sandpipers, more buffy on the breast than either, and has a\r\nshorter bill in proportion to its size than the latter. It is about the\r\nsize of the white-rumped sandpiper, but is less distinctly streaked on\r\nthe crown and back; the buff breast of the Baird will distinguish it\r\nwhen standing or even in flight; and the white rump of _fuscicollis_ is\r\na sure flight mark when visible. From the red-backed sandpiper, about\r\nthe same size, it can be distinguished by its shorter and straighter\r\nbill and by marked color differences. It might be mistaken for a female\r\npectoral, but the latter is more conspicuously striped above, more like\r\na snipe in this respect, the crown is darker, more contrasted, and the\r\nbreast is darker, more abruptly separated from the white belly, and more\r\nsharply streaked with dusky; when flying the pectoral shows more white\r\nin the wings. The Baird is but slightly smaller than the buff-breasted\r\nsandpiper and very much like it; but Prof. William Rowan (MSS.) has\r\npointed out some differences. The patterns of the backs are very\r\nsimilar, but the buff breasted has a much paler crown and lacks the\r\nwhite throat and eye stripe, as well as the clear-cut white sides and\r\nblack center of the rump of the Baird. The buff breasted has yellow legs\r\nand the Baird has black. The Baird shows no white in the wings in\r\nflight. Young Bairds in juvenal plumage are easily recognized by the\r\nscaled appearance of the mantle produced by dark feathers with broad\r\nwhite edges.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Baird sandpipers leave their northern breeding grounds rather\r\nearly. Mr. Murdoch (1885) reported the last one seen at Point Barrow on\r\nAugust 12, and Mr. Dixon (1917) saw none after August 15 in northern\r\nAlaska. E. A. Preble (1908) saw several flocks on migration at Great\r\nSlave Lake as early as July 10.\r\n\r\nThe main flight seems to be directly south through the Mackenzie Valley\r\nand between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi River to Mexico and\r\nSouth America, where it probably migrates down the west coast to its\r\nwinter home. But the route is also extended both east and west in the\r\nfall. Some birds fly southeastward, through the Great Lakes, to the\r\ncoast of New England, whence they apparently migrate over the ocean to\r\nSouth America. Others migrate southward through the extreme western\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMr. Brewster (1925) says that they \"visit Lake Umbagog (Maine) early in\r\nSeptember, appearing oftenest during the first week in the month.\" My\r\nMassachusetts dates run from August 7 to September 15. E. W. Hadeler\r\nrecords it in his Ohio notes from September 2 to October 11; and Edward\r\nS. Thomas has seen it there as early as August 12. It is an abundant\r\nmigrant in Manitoba; we collected adults there on July 29; and C. G.\r\nHarrold tells me that birds passing through in August and September are\r\npractically all juveniles. Professor Rowan refers to it as probably the\r\nmost plentiful wader in Alberta in the first half of September; he has\r\ntaken it there as late as November 8. J. A. Munro calls it a regular\r\nfall migrant at Okanagan Landing, British Columbia; his earliest and\r\nlatest dates are July 16 and September 18. J. H. Bowles (1918) observed\r\nit on the Tacoma Flats, Washington, from July 26 to September 5, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     They were found in singles, pairs, or trios, most often associating\r\n     with the semipalmated plover (_Aegialitis semipalmata_) when any\r\n     were to be found. When flying with a company of the other small\r\n     sandpipers they would separate as soon as the flock alighted to\r\n     feed, the Baird's going to comparatively dry ground for their food\r\n     while the others waded about in the water and at the water's edge.\r\n     They could not have been called common, but from one to three or\r\n     four were to be found on almost any day.\r\n\r\nJohn T. Nichols has observed Baird sandpipers on the Pacific Ocean and\r\nwrites to me as follows:\r\n\r\n     August 6, 1926, 52° 19' N., 137° 42' W., three to six birds of this\r\n     species came about a ship bound southeast for Seattle, flying with\r\n     and parallel to her course. One, apparently misjudging her speed,\r\n     was killed by striking the rigging forward. Perhaps the Baird\r\n     sandpiper is comparatively scarce on the Pacific coast due to an\r\n     offshore migration route.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--According to Prof. Wells W. Cooke (1912) this sandpiper\r\nreaches its winter home in September. Chile seems to be its principal\r\nwinter home, where it has been taken repeatedly in the high mountains at\r\n10,000 to 12,000 feet and once at over 13,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Northeastern Asia and North and South America; accidental in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--North to the northeastern coast of Siberia (probably\r\nKoliutschin Island and Cape Serdze Kamen); northern Alaska (Wainwright,\r\nPoint Barrow, Camden Bay, Barter Island, and Demarcation Point); Yukon\r\n(Herschel Island); Mackenzie (Franklin Bay, Baillie Island, and\r\nCambridge Bay); and southern Baffin Island. East to Baffin Island and\r\nprobably Greenland (Etah). South to Mackenzie (Cambridge Bay, Bernard\r\nHarbor, Fort Anderson, and Peel River); and Alaska (Cape Prince of Wales\r\nand Point Dall). West to Alaska (Cape Prince of Wales and Point Dall);\r\nand northeastern Siberia (probably Koliutschin Island).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--North to Chile (Tarapaca); and Argentina (Tucuman,\r\nCordoba, and Buenos Aires). East to Argentina (Buenos Aires). South to\r\nArgentina (Buenos Aires); and Chile (Talcahuano). West to Chile\r\n(Talcahuano, Huasco, and Tarapaca).\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--In spring the Baird sandpiper is practically\r\nunknown on the Atlantic coast, the route being up the Mississippi\r\nValley, the plains States, and (to a lesser degree) the Pacific coast.\r\nEarly dates of arrival are: Missouri, Monteer, March 20, and near\r\nBoonville, April 16; Ohio, Painesville, April 25, Oberlin, April 28, and\r\nCleveland, May 8; Michigan, Vicksburg, April 15; Iowa, Sioux City, April\r\n9, Mason City, April 19, and Marshalltown, April 25; Minnesota, Waseca,\r\nMay 10, and Hutchinson, May 18; Texas, Boerne, March 16, and Electra,\r\nApril 9; Kansas, Emporia, March 27; Nebraska, Gibbon, March 19, Lincoln,\r\nMarch 23, and Callaway, April 7; South Dakota, Forestburg, April 6, and\r\nBrown County, April 18; North Dakota, Jamestown, May 1, and Charlson,\r\nMay 4; Saskatchewan, Indian Head, May 9, and Orestwynd, May 10;\r\nMackenzie, Fort Resolution, May 19, Fort Simpson, May 20, and Fort\r\nProvidence, May 26; Arizona, Fort Verde, May 5; Colorado, Loveland,\r\nMarch 29; Wyoming, Cheyenne, April 8, and Laramie, April 23; Montana,\r\nKnowlton, May 12, and Bitterroot Valley, May 18; Alberta, Flagstaff,\r\nApril 16, Alliance, April 24, and Fort Chipewyan, May 24; California,\r\nSanta Barbara, April 27; Washington, Dayton, April 11; British Columbia,\r\nChilliwack, April 29, and Okanagan Landing, April 30; and Alaska,\r\nAdmiralty Island, May 12, Kowak River, May 20, Demarcation Point, May\r\n23, Nulato, May 27, Cape Prince of Wales, May 28, and Point Barrow, May\r\n29.\r\n\r\nLate dates of spring departure are: Mexico, city of Mexico, May 19;\r\nGuerrero, Iguala, June 1; Ohio, Youngstown, June 2; Michigan, Detroit,\r\nMay 24; Iowa, Sioux City, June 6; Texas, San Angelo, May 15, and Ingram,\r\nMay 26; Kansas, Wichita, May 20; Nebraska, Neligh, May 26, and\r\nValentine, May 30; South Dakota, Vermilion, May 24, and Sioux Falls,\r\nJune 11; North Dakota, Charlson, May 22, and Jamestown, June 4;\r\nSaskatchewan, Indian Head, June 2, and Quill Lake, June 16; Wyoming,\r\nYellowstone Park, June 3; Alberta, Fort Chipewyan, June 1; and British\r\nColumbia, Okanagan Landing, May 10, Vaseaux Lake, May 18, and Sumas, May\r\n19.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--Early dates of fall arrival are: British Columbia,\r\nOkanagan Landing, July 7; Washington, Wrights Peak, July 21, Blaine,\r\nAugust 4, and Tacoma, August 6; California, Santa Barbara, July 25;\r\nLower California, San Jose del Cabo, September 3; Alberta, Strathmore,\r\nJuly 31; Wyoming, Toltec, July 27; Colorado, Denver, July 21, Boulder\r\nCounty, July 27, and El Paso County, July 29; Saskatchewan, Maple Creek,\r\nJuly 17; Manitoba, Oak Lake, July 12, and Red Deer River, July 23; South\r\nDakota, Forestburg, July 25; Nebraska, Callaway, August 4, and Lincoln,\r\nAugust 9; Texas, San Angelo, July 20; Ontario, Toronto, July 28;\r\nMichigan, Charity Island, July 9; Ohio, Bay Point, July 3; Illinois,\r\nChicago, July 2; Massachusetts, Monomoy Island, July 14; New York,\r\nMontauk, August 14, Locust Grove, August 18, Onondaga Lake, August 27;\r\nPennsylvania, Beaver, August 21, Erie, August 22; Mexico, Zacatecas,\r\nAugust 16, Colonia Garcia, September 4, and Janos River, September 5;\r\nand Patagonia, Arroyo Seco, Rio Negro, September 6, and Huanuluan,\r\nSeptember 12.\r\n\r\nLate dates of fall departures are: Alaska, Point Barrow, September 4;\r\nBritish Columbia, Comox, September 15, and Okanagan Landing, October 18;\r\nWashington, Tacoma, September 27; Oregon, Netarts Bay, September 12;\r\nCalifornia, Monterey, October 24; Colorado, Boulder County, September\r\n25, and Barr, October 5; Saskatchewan, Indian Head, September 21;\r\nManitoba, Oak Lake, September 5, and Shoal Lake, September 14; North\r\nDakota, Charlson, September 21; Nebraska, Valentine, October 10, and\r\nLincoln, November 3; Kansas, Lawrence, October 26; Texas, Tom Green and\r\nConcho Counties, October 20; Iowa, Burlington, October 2, and Keokuk,\r\nOctober 14; Ontario, St. Thomas, October 3, Toronto, October 10, and\r\nPlover Mills, October 20; Ohio, Painesville, October 11, and New Bremen,\r\nOctober 28; Illinois, Chicago, October 2; Missouri, Independence,\r\nOctober 13; Maine, Warren Island, September 20, and Bangor, November 1;\r\nMassachusetts, Cambridge, October 30; Connecticut, West Haven, October\r\n28, and Stratford, November 3; New York, Shinnecock Bay, October 31, and\r\nCanandaigua, November 20; and Pennsylvania, Erie, October 6.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--The Baird sandpiper has several times been taken or\r\nobserved in various parts of Mexico so that it seems reasonable to\r\nbelieve that at least a part of the birds migrate over that country. In\r\nother Central American countries and in the West Indies it is rare.\r\nAmong the records are: Costa Rica (Cerro de la Candelaria, October 1900,\r\nVolcano Irazu, June 8, 1894, La Estrella de Cartago, November 5, 1907,\r\nand San Jose, September 18); and Cuba (Cocos Island). It also has been\r\ndetected on the Galapagos Islands (Barrington Island, October 6, 1897);\r\nLesser Antilles (Dominica, October 1, 1904); Virginia (Four-mile Run,\r\nSeptember 3 and 25, 1894); New Jersey (Stone Harbor, September 5, 1898);\r\nQuebec (Montreal, September 17, 1892); New Brunswick (St. Andrews,\r\nSeptember 10, 1901); and England (Rye Harbor, Sussex, November 11,\r\n1900).\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Alaska: 27 records, June 9 to August 24; 14 records, June\r\n19 to July 2. Arctic Canada: 20 records, June 10 to July 21; 10 records,\r\nJune 19 to 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nPISOBIA MINUTILLA (Vieillot)\r\n\r\nLEAST SANDPIPER\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\n_Contributed by Charles Wendell Townsend_\r\n\r\nThis least of all our sandpipers is so little smaller than the\r\nsemipalmated sandpiper and differs so slightly from it in other ways\r\nthat the two are generally confused in life. Their small size, and their\r\nnotes have given them the familiar name of \"peep,\" but near New York\r\nthey are also called \"oxeye.\" Who has not been gladdened by the sight of\r\nflocks of these gentle little birds scampering along the beach or\r\ndiligently feeding in the tidal flats and in the salt marshes!\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The duration of the spring migration is much more brief than\r\nthat of the autumnal one. The birds are hastening to their breeding\r\ngrounds and the least sandpiper is only a month in passing through. In\r\nNew England this is from about May 5 to June 7. At this time the birds\r\nare more apt to be found on the beaches than in the fall, although they\r\nare found in greatest abundance in the marshes.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--The most noticeable part of the courtship of the least\r\nsandpiper is the song. I have observed it on the breeding grounds in\r\nNova Scotia and in Labrador, as well as during the spring migration in\r\nNew England. The bird springs up into the air on quivering, down-curved\r\nwings and circles about, now lower, now higher, reaching at times a\r\nheight of 50 or more yards. In the air it emits a short sweet trill\r\nwhich is rapidly repeated, and with each song burst the wings are\r\nrapidly vibrated. On one occasion in Labrador the bird remained in the\r\nair circling and repeatedly trilling for five minutes by the watch, and\r\ncontinued to trill after it had reached the ground. Immediately it was\r\nup again, trilling, and, as I left the bog, it followed me, still\r\ntrilling.\r\n\r\nThis courtship song has been described at great length and with much\r\nappreciation by Robert T. Moore (1912) from intimate studies made by him\r\non five nesting birds in the Magdalen Islands, and he has recorded these\r\nsongs in musical notation. He ranks it high among bird songs and dwells\r\non its tremulous and pathetic qualities. He observed one that rendered\r\nits entire song from the ground within a foot of his hand. \"It\r\nconsisted of a series of trills, which ascended just one octave on a\r\nminor chord. The tone quality was pure and sweet and rendered pathetic\r\nby the minor chord, which served as its medium.\" He says of the records\r\nhe made of the flight songs of three birds that--\r\n\r\n     Each in its notes, progressions, and even time is totally different\r\n     from the others, yet, without sight of the bird, I would instantly\r\n     recognize them as songs of the least sandpiper. This is due to the\r\n     fact that the quality of tone is constant in all, being pure and\r\n     sweet, the tempo is aways extremely fast, the notes being delivered\r\n     with great rapidity, and the pitch high. Trills and runs are\r\n     characteristic and make an additional recognition quality.\r\n\r\nAll these observations were made on birds that were both incubating and\r\nsinging. On one occasion only did he see two birds together.\r\n\r\n     This flight song piped overhead and was sung over and over again\r\n     with a tremulous zest. Alternating with it, was repeated for long\r\n     intervals an excited call of two notes. We glanced up and for the\r\n     first time beheld two adult least sandpipers together. Alternately\r\n     they flapped and soared and circled about in rapturous fashion. For\r\n     several minutes the alternation of song and call continued without\r\n     break of any kind. Sometimes the song was given three times\r\n     consecutively and followed by as many as 30 or 40 repetitions of\r\n     the call, this in turn to be followed by the song again.\r\n\r\nW.E. Saunders (1902) has recorded the courtship as observed by him at\r\nSable Island. He was there between May 16 and 23, too early for nesting.\r\nHe says: \"I found them invariably in pairs, evidently mated, and often\r\nsitting so close together that two could be obtained at a single shot if\r\ndesired.\" To his ear the song notes resembled somewhat those of the\r\nspotted sandpiper. He says of the courtship flight:\r\n\r\n     Sometimes both birds would be in the air at once, but whether the\r\n     female gave the note as well as the male, I could not definitely\r\n     ascertain without shooting the birds, which I was very loath to do.\r\n     The note would be given continuously for perhaps three or four\r\n     minutes, during which time the bird flies slowly with steady\r\n     flapping of the wings, mounting in the air gradually until, when\r\n     watching them in the evening, one loses sight of them in the gloom.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The least sandpiper makes its nest either in wet grassy or\r\nsphagnum bogs close to a pond or tidal water; or on dry uplands, often\r\namong low bushes. In either case the nest is a simple affair. P.B.\r\nPhilipp (1925) describes its method of construction as observed by him\r\nin the Magdalen Islands:\r\n\r\n     The bird picks out a spot in the wet moss of a bog or in the dry\r\n     leaves of a ridge, and scratches a shallow hollow in which it sits,\r\n     and, by rapidly turning, molds a depression of the required depth.\r\n     Which of the pair does this I have never determined, but the other\r\n     bird is usually present, standing close to the nest-builder and\r\n     offering encouragement by a low, rapid twittering.\r\n\r\nThe nest depression in the moss is generally lined with dry leaves,\r\nalthough these may be very few in number, and a little dried grass. The\r\ninternal dimensions of the nest as given by Audubon (1840) are:\r\nDiameter, 2-1/2 inches; depth, 1-1/4 inches.\r\n\r\nJ. R. Whitaker writes, in his notes on these birds at Grand Lake,\r\nNewfoundland, that the nest is nearly always amongst a labyrinth of\r\npools of water, and is usually on the side or the top of a hummock of\r\nsphagnum moss, but I have found them on flat ground amongst reindeer\r\nmoss. When on a moss hummock, the scratch is about 2 inches deep and\r\nthere is always an inch or so of material in the bottom usually composed\r\nof cranberry leaves and short bits of cotton grass stems.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--[_Author's note_: Four eggs is the rule with the least\r\nsandpiper. They vary in shape from ovate pyriform (the usual shape) to\r\nsubpyriform, and they have only a slight gloss. The ground colors vary\r\nfrom \"deep olive buff\" to \"pale olive buff,\" or from \"pale pinkish buff\"\r\nto \"cartridge buff.\" There are two extreme types of markings, the boldly\r\nblotched and the finely sprinkled type, with many intergradations\r\nbetween them. Some eggs are more or less evenly covered, usually more\r\nthickly about the larger end, with a mixture of dots, small spots, and\r\nsmall, irregular blotches. In some the blotches are larger, more\r\nelongated, often spirally arranged and often confluent at the larger\r\nend. In still others the whole egg is evenly covered with very fine dots\r\nand small markings. There are two sets from Labrador of the latter type\r\nin my collection; one has a pinkish ground color, covered uniformly with\r\na fine sprinkling of reddish brown markings, exactly like certain eggs\r\nof the western sandpiper; the other set is similarly marked, but the\r\nground color is \"olive buff\" and the markings are in darker browns. At\r\nthe other end of the range of variation I have a particularly handsome\r\negg, which has an \"olive buff\" ground color, with a few large splashes\r\nof \"vinaceous drab,\" overlaid, chiefly around the larger end, with a few\r\ngreat splashes of \"liver brown,\" \"chestnut brown,\" and \"bone brown.\" The\r\nordinary markings are in various shades of dark, rich browns, \"bay,\"\r\n\"liver brown,\" \"chestnut,\" and \"hazel,\" deepening to blackish brown\r\nwhere the pigment is thickest. The underlying spots are in pale shades\r\nof \"vinaceous drab.\" The measurements of 65 eggs in the United States\r\nNational Museum average 29 by 21 millimeters; the eggs showing the four\r\nextremes measure =31= by 21, 30 by =22=, 26.5 by =20=, and 28 by =19=\r\nmillimeters.]\r\n\r\n_Young._--Incubation is believed to be performed largely by the male.\r\nMr. Philipp (1925):\r\n\r\n     Collected four birds from the nests and all proved to be males on\r\n     dissection. Also a bird which was accidentally stepped on while it\r\n     was shielding four young or \"downies\" was a male. In fact, after\r\n     the eggs are laid both birds are seldom seen around the nest. The\r\n     incubating bird is most solicitous about its nest. It sits very\r\n     closely and, when flushed, half runs, half flutters for a few feet\r\n     as if trying to lead the intruder away. If you are not deceived by\r\n     these actions but remain quiet, the bird soon returns and walks\r\n     daintily about, uttering a quickly repeated _peep, peep, peep_,\r\n     often with such vehemence that the saliva fairly runs from its\r\n     bill.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore (1912), however, shot a bird which he thought was both\r\nincubating and singing, and it proved to be a female.\r\n\r\nSometimes both parents show solicitude for the young as in the following\r\ncase in the Yukon region, reported by Dr. Louis B. Bishop (1900):\r\n\r\n     I came upon a female surrounded by four downy young. Both parents\r\n     tried time and again the well known wounded-bird tactics to lure me\r\n     from the spot where the young were hidden in the bunches of grass,\r\n     and finding this a failure, would circle around me only a few yards\r\n     off, uttering a plaintive twitter.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--[_Author's note_: The tiny chick of the least sandpiper is\r\nprettily colored as are the young of all the tundra nesting species. The\r\nupper parts, crown, back, wings, and thighs, are quite uniformly\r\nvariegated with rich browns, \"bay,\" \"chestnut\" and \"Sanford's brown,\"\r\nthrough which the black basal down shows in places; this is spotted\r\nirregularly, from crown to rump, with small round spots, terminal tufts,\r\nof yellowish buff. The forehead and sides of the head and neck are pale\r\nbuff, with narrow, black frontal, loral and malar stripes. The under\r\nparts are pure white.\r\n\r\nYoung birds are in juvenal plumage when they arrive here in August and\r\ngenerally do not show much signs of molting before they leave here in\r\nSeptember. This plumage is darker and more richly colored above than in\r\nthe spring adult; the feathers of the crown, back, scapulars and all\r\nwing coverts are broadly edged with rich, bright browns, \"hazel\" or\r\n\"cinnamon rufous,\" broadest and brightest on the back and scapulars;\r\nsome scapulars are tipped with white; the throat is often faintly, but\r\nsometimes not at all, streaked with dusky. A partial postjuvenal molt in\r\nthe fall, involving the body plumage and some of the scapulars and\r\ntertials, produces a first winter plumage which can be distinguished\r\nfrom the adult by the retained juvenal wing coverts, scapulars, and\r\ntertials. At the first prenuptial molt the next spring young birds\r\nbecome indistinguishable from adults, except for some of the old juvenal\r\nwing coverts.\r\n\r\nThe complete postnuptial molt of adults begins in August and is mainly\r\naccomplished after the birds have migrated. At a partial prenuptial\r\nmolt, mainly in April and May, the adult renews the body plumage and\r\ntail and some of the tertials and wing coverts. Adults in spring are\r\nmore brightly colored, with more rufous and buffy edgings, and the\r\nbreast is more distinctly streaked than in fall.]\r\n\r\n_Food._--These birds appear to be feeding on small crustaceans and worms\r\non the beaches and on insects and their larvae in the marshes. It is to\r\nbe hoped that with the increase of the birds the pest of green-head\r\nflies and of mosquitoes in the salt marshes may diminish. E. A. Preble\r\n(1923) examined two stomachs from birds shot in the Pribilof Islands and\r\nfound that one of them contained amphipods exclusively, the other the\r\nfollowing items: \"23 seeds of bottle brush (_Hippuris vulgaris_), 50 per\r\ncent; bits of hydroid stems, 40 per cent; and chitin from the blue\r\nmussel (_Mytilus edulis_), 10 per cent.\" A. H. Howell (1924) reports as\r\nfollows: \"Of the 19 stomachs of this bird collected in Alabama,\r\npractically all contained larvae or pupae of small flies (Chironomidae)\r\nin a few bits of aquatic beetles were found.\" Dr. Alexander Wetmore\r\n(1916) found in the stomach of a bird taken in Porto Rico \"the heads of\r\nmore than 100 minute fly larvae (75 per cent) and fragments of small\r\nbeetles (_Hetercerus_ sp.) (25 per cent).\"\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The least sandpiper has always been a confiding and an\r\nunsuspicious bird, and these characteristics have increased since it has\r\nbeen protected at all seasons. So diligent are they in their search for\r\nfood that they appear to take no notice of man if he remain quiet, and\r\nthey run about almost at his feet. They are fascinating birds to watch.\r\nNot only are they gregarious, collecting in large and small flocks on\r\nthe migrations, but they are also of a sociable disposition and\r\nassociate amicably with other shore birds, large and small. They run\r\naround among yellow legs like pigmies among giants. A mixed company of\r\nseveral kinds of sandpipers and of plovers feeding together is a common\r\nsight. In flight the different species, although in company, generally,\r\nbut not always, keep by themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the marshes--which are their preferred feeding grounds, although, as\r\nstated above, they are sometimes found on the beaches, especially in the\r\nspring--they scatter widely, and one may flush one bird after another,\r\npreviously unseen in the grass. They soon unite in a flock, however, and\r\nafter circling about and turning now this way, now that, with great\r\nnicety of evolution, drop down again suddenly, often near the spot from\r\nwhich they sprang. A single bird flushed generally darts off in\r\nirregular zigzags, very much after the manner of a Wilson snipe, calling\r\nas it goes.\r\n\r\nIn feeding in marshes they frequent the short grass and also the open\r\nsloughs or mud holes. Here they snap up insects or probe diligently for\r\nlarvae in the mud and shallow water. They are fond of the mud and sand\r\nflats in the tidal estuaries at low water where they appear to find\r\nplenty of food, and they run about on the eel grass. In all these places\r\nthey spread out in an irregular fashion when feeding. Such gluttons are\r\nthey that they are generally loaded with fat on the southward migration\r\nand they are often very fat in the spring. Notwithstanding this, their\r\nwind seems to be excellent and their flight as swift. They are fond of\r\nbathing like most birds, and of this Mr. Nichols writes in his notes as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     It squats in shallow water, ducking the head under, throwing the\r\n     water back and fluttering the wings, and at the end of the bath\r\n     jumps an inch or two into the air with a flutter, apparently to\r\n     shake the water out of its feathers. Afterwards it usually stands\r\n     quietly and gives its plumage a thorough preening.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The nuptial song has been described under courtship, but the\r\nbird has also a variety of call notes from a simple _weep_ or _peep_,\r\nfrom which, doubtless, it gets its common name, to a succession of notes\r\nmore or less complicated. John T. Nichols (1920) has written at length\r\non the voices of shore birds, and has kindly furnished the following for\r\nthis article:\r\n\r\n     The identification flight-call is a loud diagnostic _kreep_,\r\n     distinguished by the [=e][=e] sound from any note of the\r\n     semipalmated sandpiper.... In flushing, a least sandpiper sometimes\r\n     utters a string of short unloud notes with or without the [=e][=e]\r\n     sound, _quee-quee-quee-que_ or _queque_ to be followed almost\r\n     immediately by some variation of the flight call, as it gets more\r\n     fully under way. The flight note varies down to a _che_ and _cher_,\r\n     not readily, if at all, distinguishable from similar calls of the\r\n     semipalmated sandpiper.... When a flock are up and wheeling about a\r\n     feeding spot to alight there again almost at once, they have\r\n     sometimes a confiding little note _chu chu chu chu_, etc. It has\r\n     also a whinny, a little less clearly enunciated than that of the\r\n     semipalmated but almost identical with the same.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The small size of the least sandpiper distinguishes it\r\nreadily from all the other sandpipers in this country except the\r\nsemipalmated, with two exceptions to be noted later. As the least is\r\nmore frequently found on tidal flats in the estuaries and in salt\r\nmarshes, it is sometimes called the \"mud peep,\" while the semipalmated,\r\nwhich especially delights in the sand beaches is called the \"sand peep.\"\r\nUnfortunately this rule, although of general value, is far from\r\nabsolute, and the birds often exchange places. The least sandpiper is\r\nmore often found on the beach in the spring than in the fall. The\r\nsemipalmation is, of course, a diagnostic mark in the hand, but only\r\nunder exceptional circumstances can it be seen in the field. The color\r\nof the tarsus, however, is distinctive and can be made out in favorable\r\nlight at a considerable distance. I have always thought it absolutely\r\ndistinctive, but the published descriptions and plates of these two\r\nbirds are often inaccurate. I have, therefore, compared the legs of both\r\nthese species, freshly collected, with Ridgway's (1912) \"Color Standards\r\nand Color Nomenclature.\" In the semipalmated sandpiper the tarsi of the\r\nadults are black and this is also the case in the juvenals except that\r\nthere is a slight greenish tinge to be seen on close inspection. In the\r\nadult least sandpiper the tarsi are distinctly yellow with a faint\r\ngreenish cast. They correspond best to the _sulphine yellow_ of Ridgway,\r\nwhile the toes, which shade off a little darker, are _citrine_. In the\r\njuvenal, there is more of a greenish tinge, and I have put the tarsi\r\ndown as _oil yellow_, the toes shading into _yellowish oil green_. In\r\ndeciding on these colors I have had the advice of an artist. The richer\r\nbrown plumage of the back and the darker streakings and wash of the\r\nbreast help to distinguish the least from the lighter and grayer\r\nsemipalmated bird, but in the fall these distinctions are less marked in\r\nthe adult. Even at this season, however, a least sandpiper on the beach\r\nin a flock of semipalmated stands out by its browner colors, and, in the\r\nmarsh, a semipalmated in a flock of least looks very gray. The least\r\nsandpiper is a little smaller than the other bird, but this character as\r\nwell as the color of the plumage are of slight value without the\r\npresence of both birds for comparison.\r\n\r\nAnother point, which at times can be satisfactorily made out in the\r\nfield, is that the bill of the least sandpiper is slightly decurved,\r\nwhile that of the semipalmated is straight and stouter. It has been\r\nnoted by Coues (1861) and by others independently, that the least\r\nsandpiper is a perfect miniature of the pectoral sandpiper even to the\r\ncolor of its legs. The great difference in size, however, prevents any\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nTwo other sandpipers, referred to above, may, however, be mistaken for\r\nleast or semipalmated sandpipers, although they are somewhat larger.\r\nGunners at Ipswich used to call them \"bull peep.\" I refer to the\r\nwhite-rumped and the Baird sandpipers. The white rump of the former is\r\ndiagnostic and is easily seen in flight, but is generally covered by the\r\nwings when the birds are running on the sand. The plumage of both Baird\r\nand white-rumped sandpipers is dark in front of the bend of the wing,\r\nwhile in the semipalmated and juvenal least it is light. This is a fine\r\npoint that I have found of great value.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--The last migrant for the north has scarcely gone before wisps\r\nof returning sandpipers appear. The regular northward migration in\r\nMassachusetts ceases about June 7, although an occasional nonbreeding\r\nbird may remain, and the migrants begin to return about July 4. A\r\nsurprisingly large number of early fall migrants appeared at Ipswich on\r\nJuly 3, 1911. A flock of at least 50 whirled about and alighted near me\r\non the marsh. One must suppose that the early migrants in the spring are\r\nthe early ones to return in the fall. They are generally all gone from\r\nthe New England coast by the end of the first week in September,\r\nalthough stragglers may be found in October. They migrate both by day\r\nand by night.\r\n\r\nCarl Lien writes in his notes from Destruction Island, Washington, that\r\nthe least sandpiper--\r\n\r\n     Constitutes, with the western sandpiper, the great body of\r\n     migratory birds, and if the nights are a little misty the numbers\r\n     that circle around the light at night resemble a snow storm, and\r\n     they continue until daybreak when they apparently get their\r\n     bearings, and continue their journey. The spring movement begins\r\n     about the middle of April or a little later, and lasts until about\r\n     the 10th of May, beginning again the first week in July and lasting\r\n     until the middle of September.\r\n\r\n_Game._--Fortunately this bird has been removed from the list of game by\r\nthe Federal law, and we may be sure it will never be replaced. In the\r\nabsence of larger birds--too frequently the case--the gunner used to\r\nshoot these tiny birds in large numbers, and it must be admitted they\r\nwere delicious eating. At his blind near a slough or mud hole in the\r\nsalt marshes he would arrange his flock of tin or wooden decoys,\r\ngenerally made to represent yellow-legs, within easy reach of his gun,\r\nand he would call down with his tin whistle any passing flock. A\r\nprojecting spit of mud extending out into the little pool afforded a\r\nconvenient alighting place for the \"peep,\" and their death trap, for\r\nhere they could conveniently be raked by gun fire from the blind. The\r\nterrified and bewildered survivors spring into the air, and circling\r\nabout over their dead and dying companions afford several more effective\r\nshots, which shower the victims down into the mud and water. Only a\r\nremnant of the flock escapes, to fall victims, perhaps, to their easy\r\ncredulity at a neighboring blind. Sometimes the gunner in his greed\r\nwould wait for the birds to bunch together closely on the spit, but\r\nbefore this took place to his satisfaction the alarm calls of a tattler\r\nor yellow-legs might ring out over the marsh and every bird would spring\r\ninto the air and be off, much to his chagrin. Fortunately this\r\ndestruction has not been carried too far. The law has stepped in before\r\nit is too late, as alas! may be the case with some of the larger shore\r\nbirds. The increase of this species since the Federal law went into\r\neffect in 1913 is very striking. Mr. Philipp (1925) says there is \"a\r\nlarge increase in this dainty shore bird. In 1907 an exhaustive search\r\nfor breeding birds in the Magdalens resulted in finding 11 pairs. In\r\n1923 in the same territory over 50 pairs were located with eggs or\r\nyoung.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North and South America; casual in Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\n_Breeding Range._--The least sandpiper breeds north to Alaska (Cape\r\nBlossom and the Kowak River); probably Yukon (Herschel Island);\r\nMackenzie (Peel River, Fort Anderson, Rendezvous Lake, and Franklin\r\nBay); southern Franklin (Cambridge Bay); Keewatin (Cape Fullerton);\r\nLabrador (Ramah); and Newfoundland (Quarry and Gaff Topsail).

The status of the species and its nomenclature is fully\r\ndiscussed by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger (1885).\r\n\r\nThis is one of several Asiatic species that have gained places on our\r\nlist as stragglers to Alaska. A specimen of the long-toed stint was\r\ntaken by Dr. Charles H. Townsend on Otter Island, in the Pribilofs, on\r\nJune 8, 1885, constituting the only North American record. As the\r\nspecies migrates regularly through the Commander Islands to Kamchatka,\r\nit would not be surprising if careful collecting in the western\r\nAleutians showed it to occur frequently in North American territory. Its\r\nclose resemblance to some other small sandpipers might easily cause it\r\nto be overlooked. Very little seems to be known about its habits.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--Doctor Stejneger (1885) says:\r\n\r\n     The long-toed stint arrives at Bering Island in large flocks during\r\n     the latter part of May, and are then met with on sandy beaches,\r\n     where the surf has thrown up large masses of seaweed, busily\r\n     engaged in picking up the numerous small crustaceans, etc., with\r\n     which the weeds abound. Most of the birds stay only a few days,\r\n     going further north, while a small number remain over summer,\r\n     breeding sparingly on the large swamp behind the village. My\r\n     efforts to find the nests were unsuccessful, but I shot birds near\r\n     Zapornaja Reschka on the 17th and 22d of June, and on the 7th of\r\n     August.\r\n\r\nW. Sprague Brooks (1915) reports birds seen or taken at points in\r\nKamchatka on May 21 and 25, 1913, which probably were just arriving on\r\ntheir breeding grounds.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--I can find no description of the nesting habits of the\r\nlong-toed stint in print and have located only one set of eggs. This is\r\nin Col. John E. Thayer's collection and has very scanty data. It was\r\ntaken by O. Bernhaner at Lake Baikal, Siberia, on June 18, 1902; the\r\nnest was \"placed on the ground.\" The four eggs in this set are ovate\r\npyriform in shape and have hardly any gloss. The ground colors vary from\r\n\"olive buff\" to \"deep olive buff.\" They are spotted, chiefly at the\r\nlarger end, with \"snuff brown,\" \"sepia,\" and \"warm sepia,\" with a few\r\nunderlying spots of \"pale brownish drab.\" They measure 28.3 by 20, 28 by\r\n19.7, 28.5 by 20.7 and 28.3 by 20 millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy young seems to be entirely unknown. I have not\r\nseen enough specimens to add anything to our knowledge of the molts. Mr.\r\nRidgway (1919) has described the immature and seasonal plumages quite\r\nfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--Said to breed in eastern Siberia, the shores of the\r\nSea of Okhotsk, Kamchatka, Bering Island, and south to the Kurile\r\nIslands. Eggs have been taken at Lake Baikal, Siberia, and it probably\r\nbreeds in the valley of the Lena River, south of the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The Malay Archipelago, India, Burma, Ceylon, the\r\nPhilippines, and Australia.\r\n\r\n_Migration._--It arrives on Bering Island during the latter part of May\r\nand on Kamchatka as early as May 21. Fall migrants reach the Philippines\r\nas early as August 10.\r\n\r\n_Casual record._--Accidental on the Pribilof Islands, Otter Island, June\r\n8, 1885.\r\n\r\n_Egg date._--Siberia: 1 record, June 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nPISOBIA RUFICOLLIS (Pallas)\r\n\r\nRUFOUS-NECKED SANDPIPER\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nA long time ago Col. John E. Thayer (1909) added this species to the\r\nNorth American list. In a lot of birds which he received from A. H.\r\nDunham were a pair of adults and two young of the rufous-necked\r\nsandpiper, or eastern least stint, as it is also called. They were\r\ncollected at Nome, Alaska, on July 10, 1908, where they had evidently\r\nbred. This record was discredited, however, and the species was placed\r\non the hypothetical list. But the species was firmly established as a\r\nNorth American bird by Alfred M. Bailey (1926), who reported the capture\r\nof two specimens in Alaska, an adult female at Cape Prince of Wales on\r\nJune 11, and a bird of the year at Wainwright on August 15, 1922. The\r\nbirds were breeding in that vicinity, an offshoot from the main breeding\r\nrange of the species in northeastern Siberia.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The main migration route is northward from southern Asia, the\r\nPhilippine Islands, and even Australia, through the Kurile and Commander\r\nIslands and Kamchatka to its breeding grounds. Dr. Leonhard Stejneger\r\n(1885) says:\r\n\r\n     This species arrives at Bering Island late in May in rather large\r\n     flocks, but does not stay long. None were met with during the whole\r\n     summer, until, in the first half of September, they took a short\r\n     rest on the shores of our island before continuing their long\r\n     travel to the southward.\r\n\r\nA large series of these birds was collected by the Jesup North Pacific\r\nexpedition in northeastern Siberia. Dr. J. A. Allen (1905) quotes from\r\nthe field notes of N. G. Buxton as follows:\r\n\r\n     Abundant spring and fall migrant, and some breed at Kooshka, but\r\n     the majority move farther inland during the breeding season. First\r\n     birds arrived May 28, and were common on the 30th in large flocks\r\n     and in company with the red backed. By June 5 they have paired or\r\n     passed on, and are not common again until the second week of July.\r\n     They have mostly gone by September 11. In habits similar to\r\n     _Pelidna alpina_.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Mr. Bailey (1926) was fortunate enough to see a pair\r\nbuilding their nest, along a stream bed on the high tundra at the base\r\nof Wales Mountain, Alaska; in his notes for June 14, 1922, he wrote:\r\n\r\n     With my glasses I watched a pair of little pink-necked sandpipers\r\n     as they worked around the grass at the foot of the hill. The male\r\n     would give up his searching among the dried grass stalks to\r\n     demonstrate his love for his little partner, upon which she would\r\n     take to wing and circle about. Finally she entered a little tussock\r\n     of grass, standing on her \"nose\" fluttering her tail and wings.\r\n     Soon the male pushed his way inside, too, and after a few more\r\n     rustling about, they took to wing. I looked in the grass and found\r\n     a little cavity which they were just lining with leaves. Upon\r\n     examining their nesting clump, I found a small pit, exactly similar\r\n     to the nest of the western sandpiper, in which they had deposited\r\n     about 20 small willow leaves. I marked the spot carefully, but upon\r\n     my return found the nest abandoned.\r\n\r\nW. Sprague Brooks (1915) found a few pairs breeding at the head of\r\nProvidence Bay, northeastern Siberia; he writes:\r\n\r\n     Two sets of fresh eggs, numbering three and four, respectively,\r\n     were taken on June 11, 1913; the male incubating one and the female\r\n     the other. Both birds when disturbed fluttered off the nest like\r\n     other sandpipers. The nests were cavities on small mounds of tundra\r\n     lined with dry willow leaves.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--I have been unable to locate any eggs of the rufous-necked\r\nsandpiper and do not know what became of the two sets referred to above.\r\nJoseph Dixon (1918) implies that the eggs resemble those of the\r\nspoonbill sandpiper.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--In the downy young the crown and upper parts are variegated\r\nwith black, \"tawny\" and \"warm buff\"; the forehead, superciliary stripe\r\nand sides of the head and neck are \"warm buff\"; the under parts are\r\nwhite, washed on the breast with pale buff; a narrow median stripe on\r\nthe forehead and a broader loral stripe are black. The specimen\r\ndescribed above was taken at Cape Serdze, Siberia, on July 16, and shows\r\nthe beginning of the juvenal plumage; the back and scapulars are well\r\ncovered with young feathers and the wings are well started, though the\r\nbird is still very small and mostly downy. The feathers of the back and\r\nscapulars are black, broadly edged with \"hazel,\" and the scapulars are\r\ntipped with white.\r\n\r\nOlder young and subsequent plumages are well described by Robert Ridgway\r\n(1919). The molts are apparently similar to those of other species in\r\nthe genus. The postnuptial molt of the body plumage occurs mainly in\r\nAugust and the wings and tail are molted in January and February. I have\r\nseen birds in winter plumage as early as August 13 and as late as March\r\n15. Probably the prenuptial molt of the body plumage takes place in\r\nApril. In fresh nuptial plumage the bright colors of the upper parts are\r\nveiled with \"drab-gray\" tips, which soon wear away. There is much\r\nindividual variation in the amount of rufous on the head, neck, and\r\nbreast. Mr. Dixon (1918) says that in this plumage the rufous-necked\r\nsandpiper looks very much like the spoonbill sandpiper; and, as its\r\nbehavior is similar, it might easily be mistaken for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--Northeastern Siberia (probably the delta of the Lena\r\nRiver and the shores of the Sea of Okhotsk, certainly at Providence Bay,\r\nKooshka, and Cape Serdze); and northwestern Alaska (Cape Prince of\r\nWales, Wainwright, and probably Nome.)\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The Malay Archipelago, the Philippines, and Australia.\r\n\r\n_Migrations._--First arrivals reach Gichiga, Siberia, May 28, and they\r\nare mostly gone by September 11. They pass Bering Island late in May and\r\nagain during the first half of September. One taken by G. Dallas Hanna\r\non St. Paul Island, August 27, 1920. They have been taken in the\r\nPhilippines as early as August 13. Japan, China, and Lake Baikal are\r\nincluded in the migration route.\r\n\r\n\r\nPELIDNA ALPINA ALPINA (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\nDUNLIN\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThe well-known European dunlin has occurred occasionally as a straggler\r\non our eastern coasts, Massachusetts and New York. It has probably\r\noccurred here more often than is known, for it closely resembles our\r\nred-backed sandpiper, especially in winter plumage. There is no reason\r\nwhy it should not occur here more often, for it is now known to breed\r\nregularly on the east coast of Greenland.\r\n\r\nThayer and Bangs (1914) thought, at one time, that we should recognize\r\nthree races of the dunlin, which they designated as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Pelidna alpina alpina_ (Linn.), western Europe. Small, with\r\n     shortest, straightest bill; upper parts darker with less reddish;\r\n     heavily spotted (sometimes almost streaked) with dusky below,\r\n     between throat and black breast patch.\r\n\r\n     _Pelidna alpina pacifica_ Coues. North America. Much larger, with\r\n     much longer, more curved bill; upper parts paler with much more\r\n     reddish; much less heavily spotted with dusky below, between\r\n     throat and black breast patch.\r\n\r\n     _Pelidna alpina sakhalina_ (Vieill.) East Siberia. Size and length\r\n     and shape of bill intermediate between that of the other two\r\n     forms; colors much paler than in either; upper parts very pale\r\n     reddish, much mixed with gray; back of neck and top of head nearly\r\n     wholly pale gray; below very slightly spotted with dusky, between\r\n     throat and black breast patch (much less so, even than in\r\n     _pacifica_).\r\n\r\nRecently, Mr. Bangs tells me, he has come to the conclusion that the\r\nSiberian bird should not be separated from the American, as the\r\ncharacters are too slight and rather intermediate. This seems like a\r\nwise decision, as the naming of intermediates is undesirable.\r\n\r\nMuch has been published on the habits of the dunlin, but, as they differ\r\nbut little from those of our birds, it seems superfluous to write its\r\nfull life history.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Comparatively few of the great hosts of dunlins which visit\r\nEngland in fall and winter breed on the mainland of Great Britain.\r\nMacgillivray (1852) gives a good account of their nesting habits in\r\nScotland, as follows:\r\n\r\n     The dunlins, in fact, breed in great numbers on the heaths of many\r\n     parts of Scotland and its larger islands, where they may be found\r\n     scattered in the haunts selected by the golden plovers, with which\r\n     they are so frequently seen in company that they have popularly\r\n     obtained the name of plovers' pages. Sometimes about the middle of\r\n     April, but always before that of May, they are seen dispersed over\r\n     the moors in pairs like the birds just named, which at this season\r\n     they greatly resemble in manners. From this period until the end of\r\n     August none are to be found along the shores of the sea, instead of\r\n     searching which, they now seek for insects and worms, in the\r\n     shallow pools, soft ground, and by the edges of lakes and marshes.\r\n     The male frequently flies up to a person intruding upon his haunts,\r\n     and sometimes endeavours to entice him away by feigning lameness.\r\n\r\nRev. Henry H. Slater (1898) says that the nest \"is usually in a tussock\r\nof grass, a roughly made hollow, inartistically lined with grass, but\r\noften carefully concealed in the herbage.\"\r\n\r\nA. L. V. Manniche (1910) found the dunlin a common breeding bird on the\r\nnortheast coast of Greenland. He writes:\r\n\r\n     The nests are most frequently built on hillocks with long grass. I\r\n     found, however, not seldom nests of dunlins on small islets covered\r\n     with short grass, but always near to or surrounded by shallow\r\n     water. The dunlin's nest is often placed on similar spots, and has\r\n     the same exterior as that of the phalarope, but it can easily be\r\n     distinguished, as the bottom of the dunlin's nest is always lined\r\n     with a few withered leaves of _Salix arctica_, while the phalarope\r\n     uses bent straws as layer for its eggs. On spots where many dunlins\r\n     nest several newly scratched but half-finished nests may always be\r\n     found; they are probably left because the birds have found the\r\n     ground too wet. The dunlins like to nest on moors and bogs partly\r\n     irrigated by melted snow streaming down from the rocks. On such\r\n     places I found many nests with eggs and newborn downy young, which\r\n     were lying close together in broods carefully guarded by the old\r\n     female, on isolated larger hillocks surrounded by the ice-cold snow\r\n     water. When the flood of melting snow is unusually strong, such\r\n     localities may be completely inundated, and then not only the eggs\r\n     but also the frail young ones, which are not yet able to save\r\n     themselves by swimming through the cold water to dry spots, will be\r\n     destroyed.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The great amount of variation in the beautiful eggs of the\r\ndunlin is well illustrated in Frank Poynting's (1895) fine colored plate\r\nof 12 eggs. Herbert Massey (1913) gives a better description of the eggs\r\nthan I can give, so I quote him, as follows:\r\n\r\n     The eggs of this species resemble those of _G. gallinago_ very\r\n     closely in color, but in comparing a series (74 sets or 296 eggs)\r\n     with that of _G. gallinago_ one is struck by the greater proportion\r\n     of the lighter ground colors in the dunlin, the very deep olives\r\n     and the very dark browns being almost absent. On the other hand,\r\n     the beautiful light blue-green and the pale buff are rare in _G.\r\n     gallinago_. The surface spots are chiefly two shades of brown, a\r\n     rich red and a dark brown, with, in many cases, spots of violet\r\n     gray. In _T. alpina_ it is rare to find the two shades of brown in\r\n     the same egg, as is often the case with _G. gallinago_. The\r\n     markings are very varied, some eggs dusted all over with tiny\r\n     specks, others with specks and fair-sized spots, and again others\r\n     with great blotches of color, chiefly at the larger end. The\r\n     pattern markings on the eggs of the same set are often very\r\n     dissimilar. Many of the eggs of this species show the spiral\r\n     arrangement of the spots. The eggs are very glossy, and on this\r\n     account have a brighter appearance than eggs of _G. gallinago_. I\r\n     have only one set entirely without gloss.\r\n\r\nThe number of eggs is normally four, occasionally only three, and as\r\nmany as five and even six have been found in a nest. The measurements of\r\n100 eggs, furnished by Rev. F. C. R. Jourdain, average 34.3 by 24.4\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =38.3= by 25.4,\r\n35 by =25.8=, =31.3= by 23.2, and 32 by =23= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Incubation is shared by both sexes and requires 22 days.\r\nMacgillivray (1852) says of the young:\r\n\r\n     Like those of the golden plover and lapwing, they leave the nest\r\n     immediately after exclusion from the egg, run about, and when\r\n     alarmed conceal themselves by sitting close to the ground and\r\n     remaining motionless. If at this period a person approaches their\r\n     retreat, the male especially, but frequently the female also, flies\r\n     up to meet the intruder and uses the same artifices for deceiving\r\n     him as many other birds of this family. After they are able to\r\n     shift for themselves the young remain several weeks on the moors\r\n     with their parents, both collecting into small flocks, which are\r\n     often intermingled with those of the golden plover, and often in\r\n     the evenings uniting into larger. They rest at night on the\r\n     smoother parts of the heath, and both species, when resting by day,\r\n     either stand or lie on the ground. When one advances within a\r\n     hundred yards of such a flock it is pleasant to see them stretch up\r\n     their wings, as if preparing for flight, utter a few low notes, and\r\n     immediately stand on the alert, or run a short way; but at this\r\n     season they are not at all shy.\r\n\r\nSeton Gordon (1915), after giving a charming account of the breeding\r\nhaunts of the dunlin in Scotland, has this to say about the solicitude\r\nof a devoted mother.\r\n\r\n     It was about this time that I saw the hen in precisely the same\r\n     locality as before. She showed much more anxiety than the cock,\r\n     uttering almost incessantly two alarm notes as she walked round me.\r\n     One of these notes was the characteristic trill, unlike, I think,\r\n     any other cry in the bird world; the other, which appeared to be\r\n     the note of extra alarm, was a harsh cry reminding me much of the\r\n     alarm note of the lesser tern. In order to observe the effect, I\r\n     called several times, imitating the cry of one of her chicks. The\r\n     effect was striking and instantaneous; the bird rushed up in alarm\r\n     and literally rolled herself about on the ground with feathers\r\n     ruffled. She, indeed, presented such an appearance that it was\r\n     quite impossible to see her head or feet emerging from the\r\n     disheveled bundle into which she rolled herself. Evidently her\r\n     tactics were quite different--considerably less elegant, but\r\n     perhaps equally forcible--to those used by the dotterel under\r\n     similar circumstances. After a time she began to realize that her\r\n     deception was producing no effect on the object of her mistrust,\r\n     and moved anxiously round me.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--In natal down the young dunlin is similar to the young\r\nred-backed sandpiper, but is paler in color, more buffy, and less\r\nrufous. The subsequent molts and plumages are similar to those of our\r\nAmerican bird. They are well described in Witherby's (1920) Handbook.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Macgillivray (1852) made some careful observations on the\r\nfeeding habits of dunlins, which are well worth quoting, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Being in a muddy place, which probably afforded a good supply of\r\n     food, they did not run much, but yet moved quickly about, with\r\n     their legs a little bent, the body horizontal, the head a little\r\n     declined, and the bill directed forward toward the ground at an\r\n     angle of about 45°. I observed that they seemed in general merely\r\n     to touch the surface, but also sometimes to introduce their bill\r\n     into the mud for about a fourth of its length; but this was always\r\n     with a rapid tapping and somewhat wriggling movement, and not by\r\n     thrusting it in sedately. This flock having flown away, I observed\r\n     another of about 12 individuals alight at a little distance on the\r\n     other side of the mill stream. Being very intent on tapping the\r\n     mud, they allowed me to approach within 10 paces, so that I could\r\n     see them very distinctly. I examined the marks made by them in the\r\n     mud. Although it was soft, very few footmarks were left, but the\r\n     place was covered with numberless small holes made by their bills,\r\n     and forming little groups, as if made by the individual birds\r\n     separately. Of these impressions very many were mere hollows not\r\n     much larger than those on a thimble, and not a twelfth of an inch\r\n     deep; others scarcely perceptible, while a few were larger,\r\n     extending to a depth of two-twelfths; and here and there one or two\r\n     to the depth of nearly half an inch. On scraping the mud, I could\r\n     perceive no worms or shells. It is thus clear that they search by\r\n     gently tapping, and it appears that they discover the object of\r\n     their search rather by the kind of resistance which it yields than\r\n     by touch like that of the human skin.\r\n\r\nWitherby's (1920) Handbook says that the food is mainly animal and\r\nincludes mollusks, worms, crustaceans (shrimps and sandhoppers), insects\r\n(beetles, flies, etc.), and spiders.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The habits of the European dunlin seem to be the same as\r\nthose of our bird. It is equally tame and confiding, unless shot at too\r\nmuch, and it has the same habit of flying in large, closely bunched\r\nflocks. John T. Nichols tells me that some that he saw near Liverpool in\r\nSeptember, \"when on the ground, moved about very actively for the most\r\npart (contrasted with the sluggishness of the redback as we know it in\r\nmigration) and presented a low, hunch-shouldered figure.\" Abel Chapman\r\n(1924) says:\r\n\r\n     On one occasion, on May 14, seeing three small waders floating on\r\n     the mirror-like surface of the tide and quite 200 yards offshore,\r\n     we punted out to them in full anticipation of having at last fallen\r\n     in with phalaropes. Curiously, the trio proved to be dunlins, a\r\n     species I can not recall having seen contentedly swimming in deep\r\n     water on any other occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--Northern Europe: Iceland, the Faroes, British Isles,\r\nnorthern coasts of Germany, northern Russia east to Kolguev,\r\nSpitzbergen, and probably Nova Zembla. South to Holland and rarely to\r\nnorthern Spain and northern Italy. Replaced by one or more other forms\r\nin Siberia, to which Asiatic migrants probably belong.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--Great Britain, Madeira, the Canaries, the\r\nMediterranean, northern and eastern Africa as far south as Zanzibar, the\r\nRed Sea, and perhaps India.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--Accidental in North America; Shinnecock Bay, Long\r\nIsland, New York, September 15, 1892; Chatham, Massachusetts, August 11,\r\n1900. It has probably been many times overlooked.\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Orkney Islands: 50 records, May 12 to June 27; 25 records,\r\nMay 20 to June 2. Iceland: 16 records, May 18 to June 16; 8 records,\r\nJune 3 to 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nPELIDNA ALPINA SAKHALINA (Vieillot)\r\n\r\nRED-BACKED SANDPIPER\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nAlthough this sandpiper is certainly red-backed enough to deserve the\r\nname, it seems to me that American dunlin would be a better name, as it\r\nis only subspecifically distinct from the well-known European dunlin.\r\nThe doubtful question as to whether a third subspecies should be\r\nrecognized on the Pacific coast has been referred to under the preceding\r\nform.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--It is a hardy bird and perhaps a lazy bird for it winters\r\nfarther north than most of its tribe and makes shorter migrations than\r\nany of the waders that breed in Arctic regions. From its winter range\r\nwell within the United States it migrates northward from Florida and the\r\nCarolinas along the Atlantic coast to the Middle States, rarely to New\r\nEngland, through the Great Lakes region, and along the west coast of\r\nHudson Bay to its summer home on the barren grounds. C. J. Pennock tells\r\nme he has seen it in Florida, Wakulla County, as late as May 26; I found\r\nit very abundant and in fine spring plumage on the coastal islands of\r\nSouth Carolina on May 22 and 23; and I have seen it near Corpus Christi,\r\nTexas, as late as May 29. These are all late dates, however, for the\r\nmigration starts in April and is generally completed in May. A single\r\nbird which I saw on the coast of Louisiana on June 22, 1910, was a\r\nnonbreeding loiterer. A. G. Lawrence and C. G. Harrold both record it in\r\ntheir notes as common in Manitoba from the middle to the last of May (12\r\nto 29). William Rowan, however, finds it rare in Alberta.\r\n\r\nThere is a heavy northward migration along the Pacific coast. In some\r\nnotes sent to me by D. E. Brown from Grays Harbor, Washington, he says:\r\n\r\n     This bird, next to the western sandpiper, was by far the most\r\n     abundant of all the shore birds. It was noted in immense flocks the\r\n     day of my arrival, May 3, and was very common when I left, May 24.\r\n     Mixed flocks of this species and western sandpipers must have\r\n     contained 6,000 or 7,000 birds.\r\n\r\nHerbert W. Brandt in his manuscript notes says:\r\n\r\n     The red-backed sandpiper is one of the most abundant shore birds\r\n     inhabiting the Hooper Bay region, confining itself almost entirely\r\n     to the low-lying flats. The Eskimos first reported this hardy\r\n     species on May 10 and two days later we collected our first\r\n     specimen at Point Dall. They were common in loose flocks by May 15\r\n     and abundant by May 20. At that time they were often associated\r\n     with the Aleutian sandpiper, to which, in the field, they bear a\r\n     marked resemblance. Soon after the later date the flocks\r\n     disintegrated into mated couples and they then repaired to their\r\n     lowland breeding haunts.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Dr. E. W. Nelson (1887) gives an attractive account of the\r\ncourtship of this species, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Soon after they arrive in spring they are engaged in pairing, and\r\n     the males may be seen upon quivering wings flying after the female\r\n     and uttering a musical, trilling note, which falls upon the ear\r\n     like the mellow tinkle of large water drops falling rapidly into a\r\n     partly filled vessel. Imagine the sounds thus produced by the water\r\n     run together into a steady and rapid trill some 5 to 10 seconds in\r\n     length, and the note of this sandpiper is represented. It is not\r\n     loud but has a rich full tone, difficult to describe, but pleasant\r\n     to hear among the discordant notes of the various waterfowl whose\r\n     hoarse cries arise on all sides. As the lover's suit approaches its\r\n     end the handsome suitor becomes exalted, and in his moments of\r\n     excitement he rises 15 or 20 yards, and, hovering on tremulous\r\n     wings over the object of his passion, pours forth a perfect gush of\r\n     music, until he glides back to earth exhausted, but ready to repeat\r\n     the effort a few minutes later. The female coyly retreats before\r\n     the advances of the male, but after various mishaps each bird finds\r\n     its partner for the summer and they start off house hunting in all\r\n     the ardor of a rising honeymoon.\r\n\r\nMr. Brandt in his manuscript notes describes it a little differently,\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n     The red-backed sandpiper, often called the American dunlin, arrives\r\n     in flocks, the individuals of which are apparently not all mated. A\r\n     female will jump up and be immediately pursued by two to five\r\n     males, and as they all twist about, in and out, twittering all the\r\n     time, the alternate flashing of their reddish backs and black lower\r\n     parts seems like the signals of the telegraphic code. The males\r\n     appear never to catch the females, but to try to keep as close to\r\n     them as possible. When they alight again in the flock whence they\r\n     started they at once resume feeding without further display. The\r\n     thrilling song of this dainty bird is delivered while hovering with\r\n     quivering wing beats in mid-air. It appears as if both male and\r\n     female carry on the vocal effort, which sounds something like the\r\n     cheery tinkling of ice in a glass, and ends with a real lover's\r\n     note _dear, dear, dear_. This is repeated again and again and is\r\n     one of the pleasant characteristic songs of the marshy grass-woven\r\n     flats, where the discords of waterfowl prevail. After the fastest\r\n     male has captured his elusive sweetheart the two retire to their\r\n     chosen place on the flats to take up their more serious duties.\r\n     Here the female lays her eggs, often in a situation that is moist,\r\n     and never very far from a small pond or slough.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The same observer says of the nest:\r\n\r\n     The home of the red-backed sandpiper is almost always found on a\r\n     dry eminence in the widespread grassy tidelands, where, near some\r\n     pool under the damp matted vegetation of the previous year,\r\n     sufficient concealment is afforded. Here in a mere depression in\r\n     the ground, still frozen underneath, a fragile nest is hurriedly\r\n     made of dry grass stems and filled, rather than lined, with the\r\n     tiny crisp leaves of the berry-bearing plants, that are deposited\r\n     by the flood tides of autumn in this area. The range of\r\n     measurements of 25 nests is: Inside diameter, 3-1/2 to 4 inches;\r\n     inside depth 2 to 3 inches; total depth, 3 to 5 inches.\r\n\r\n     This sandpiper is among the early nesters, we having taken the\r\n     first completed set of eggs on May 29, while by June 1 we had\r\n     discovered 75. The middle of June found the downy young bursting\r\n     forth, dainty creatures clad in black and brown with markings\r\n     similar to those of the other sandpiper chicks.\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Grinnell (1900) found this species breeding on the Arctic\r\ncoast of Alaska, about 20 miles northeast of Cape Prince of Wales, on\r\nJune 27 and 28; he writes:\r\n\r\n     The birds were found scattered out on the tundras whence they could\r\n     be flushed from their nests or from where they had been feeding.\r\n     One nest was a cup-shaped cavity slightly lined with grasses and\r\n     sunk into the top of a hummock of moss surrounded by marshy ground.\r\n     The two others found were similarly located except that they were\r\n     embedded in clumps of grass, and mostly hidden from view by the\r\n     surrounding blades. Each nest contained four eggs. One was fresh\r\n     but the other two were considerably incubated.\r\n\r\nProf. Wells W. Cooke (1912) made the statement that this species has two\r\nbreeding areas \"separated by nearly 1,500 miles of Arctic coast, from\r\nPoint Barrow to the Boothia Peninsula,\" where \"there seems to be no\r\ncertain record of the occurrence of the red-backed sandpiper.\" This is\r\nfar from true, for it is well known to breed there and eggs have been\r\ntaken at many places along the Arctic coast.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Herbert W. Brandt (Mss.) describes his series of 120 eggs of\r\nthis sandpiper very well, as follows:\r\n\r\n     The four eggs of the red-backed sandpiper, which is their\r\n     complement, are very handsome and show more variation than the eggs\r\n     of most of the other shore birds breeding in the Hooper Bay region.\r\n     In shape they are subpyriform to ovate pyriform and rest amid the\r\n     leafy nest lining with the small ends together often so placed that\r\n     the sitting bird during incubation touches only the larger ends.\r\n     The shell is not as strong as many shore-bird eggs of the same size\r\n     but they are not fragile by any means and they have considerable\r\n     luster. As was true of many of the limicoline eggs found along that\r\n     Bering Sea coast, there were two general types of ground color--the\r\n     one, the greenish, that predominated by a ratio of about 15 to\r\n     1--and the other was the brownish type. The ground color ranges\r\n     from \"pale glaucous green\"--that is the most common type--to\r\n     \"glaucous green,\" while the brownish-tinged eggs shade from \"olive\r\n     buff\" to \"dark olive buff.\" The surface markings are conspicuous\r\n     and vary greatly, for on some types the spots are small and well\r\n     scattered over the eggs; on others they are large, irregular, and\r\n     bold; while on still other specimens they are confluent on the\r\n     larger end and form a blotch that completely decorates that part of\r\n     the egg.\r\n\r\n     These spots are irregular in shape, but are inclined to be\r\n     elongated with their axis twisting to the right, so that when a\r\n     series of eggs is viewed looking toward the larger end, the spots\r\n     produce a clockwise spiral. Some of these spots are more twisted\r\n     than others, but on a few eggs there are no spiral tendencies at\r\n     all. The surface spots are quite variable in color, dependent\r\n     largely on the thickness of the pigment deposited, for where the\r\n     latter is thin the true color is observable, but when the\r\n     decoration is liberal, the blot becomes opaque and the color is\r\n     lost. These spots range from \"auburn\" and \"raw umber\" to \"chestnut\r\n     brown\" and \"blackish brown.\" The underlying spots are well hidden\r\n     by the boldness of the surface markings and inclined to be small\r\n     and regular and are often more or less numerous. Their shades are\r\n     delicate, ranging from \"pallid gray\" to \"mouse gray.\" An occasional\r\n     egg exhibits scattering insignificant additional markings of deep\r\n     \"blackish brown.\"\r\n\r\nThe measurements of 145 eggs average 36.3 by 25.3 millimeters; the eggs\r\nshowing the four extremes measure =40.1= by 25.9, 39.2 by =26.5=, =34=\r\nby 25, and 34.5 by =23.5= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Both sexes incubate and are rather close sitters, as well as\r\ndevoted and bold in the defense of their young. The period of incubation\r\nis probably the same as for the European dunlin, 22 days. John Murdoch\r\n(1885) says:\r\n\r\n     Both parents share in the work of incubation, though we happened to\r\n     obtain more males than females with the eggs. The young are pretty\r\n     generally hatched by the first week in July, and both adults and\r\n     young keep pretty well out of sight till the 1st of August, when\r\n     they begin to show about the lagoons and occasionally about the\r\n     beach, many of the young birds still downy about the head. The\r\n     autumn flight of young birds appears about the middle of August,\r\n     associating with the young _A. maculata_ and _M. griseus\r\n     scolopaceus_, in good-sized flocks, particularly about the pools on\r\n     the high tundra below Cape Smythe. They continue plenty in these\r\n     localities, sometimes appearing along the beach, for about a week,\r\n     when the greater part of them depart, leaving only a few stragglers\r\n     that stay till the first few days of September.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy young red-backed is much paler and more buffy\r\nthan that of the least sandpiper. The crown, back, wings, and thighs are\r\nvariegated with brownish black, \"ochraceous tawny\" and \"hazel,\" except\r\nat the base of the down on the back, there is no rich, deep brown; the\r\nabove parts are quite thickly sprinkled, especially on the back, with\r\nminute, round spots, terminal tufts of pale buff; a distinct stripe of\r\nthese nearly encircles the posterior half of the crown. The black of the\r\ncrown extends nearly to the bill and there is a black loral stripe; the\r\nrest of the head and a band across the lower throat are \"warm buff.\" The\r\nrest of the under parts are white. The nape is a grizzly mixture of dull\r\nbuff and dusky.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage, as seen in Alaska in August, is strikingly handsome\r\nand quite distinctive. The feathers of the crown are dusky, edged with\r\n\"ochraceous tawny\"; the sides of the head and nape are \"drab-gray,\"\r\nstreaked with dusky; the feathers of the back are black, broadly edged\r\nwith three colors in different areas, \"ochraceous tawny,\" \"hazel,\" and\r\nbuffy white; the scapulars are black, edged with \"light ochraceous\r\nbuff\"; the wing coverts are gray, tipped with pale buff; the rump and\r\nupper tail coverts are \"hair brown\" to \"drab\"; the breast is tinged with\r\ngrayish and pale buff and streaked with dusky; the throat and rest of\r\nthe under parts are white, conspicuously and more or less heavily\r\nspotted with dusky on the sides of the belly. This beautiful plumage is\r\nworn for only a short time and is molted before the birds leave their\r\nnorthern breeding grounds. The postjuvenal molt begins in August and is\r\ngenerally finished before October; it involves nearly all of the body\r\nplumage, nearly all of the scapulars, and some of the tertials, but not\r\nthe rump, upper tail coverts, or flight feathers.\r\n\r\nIn first winter plumage young birds are much like adults, but the ashy\r\nbrown upper parts are usually somewhat paler, and they can always be\r\nrecognized by the juvenal wing coverts and a few retained scapulars and\r\ntertials. A partial prenuptial molt, similar to that of the adult,\r\nproduces a first nuptial plumage, in which young birds can be\r\ndistinguished only by the retained juvenal wing coverts. In fresh\r\nplumage the black belly patch is veiled with white tips, which soon wear\r\naway and leave this area clear black.\r\n\r\nThe first postnuptial molt of young birds and the corresponding molt of\r\nadults produce adult winter plumages. The molt is complete and begins in\r\nJuly or even late in June; the wings are apparently molted first in\r\nJuly, and are entirely renewed before the birds start to migrate; the\r\nbody molt begins in August and lasts through September; there are\r\nusually traces of the old nuptial plumage left when the birds arrive\r\nhere on migration. The partial prenuptial molt of adults comes in April\r\nand May and involves the body plumage, but not all the scapulars or rump\r\nor wing coverts.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Red-backed sandpipers obtain their food on the ocean beaches at\r\nlow tide, on sandy flats or on mud flats, often feeding in company with\r\nsanderlings, or with other small shore birds. Some writers have referred\r\nto them as nervous and active running about in a lively manner while\r\nfeeding, but I have usually found them rather sluggish and inactive at\r\nsuch times, easily approached and unsuspicious. Their food consists of\r\nsmall mollusks, sand fleas, and other small crustaceans, amphipods,\r\nflies and other insects and their larvae, diving and other aquatic\r\nbeetles, marine worms, and occasionally a few seeds of aquatic plants.\r\nThey are apt to gather where fish cleanings and other offal are thrown\r\nout, to feed on the flies and other insects that abound there. Dr.\r\nCharles W. Townsend (1905) writes:\r\n\r\n     In feeding they frequently plunge the bill, slightly open to its\r\n     base in the soft sand or mud, appear to work it about and when\r\n     successful draw forth an amphipod or a worm. Several times on one\r\n     occasion I saw one draw a worm to the water close at hand as if to\r\n     wash it before swallowing it. On another occasion a couple of\r\n     dunlins were so tame that it was possible to approach within 5 feet\r\n     of them. They were diligently probing in the sandy mud, wading in\r\n     water up to their bellies. At this depth it was necessary for them\r\n     to immerse their heads entirely, and I could see them shut their\r\n     eyes as they went under water. Whether the eyes were afterwards\r\n     opened or not I am unable to say. When disturbed they flew but a\r\n     short way, and if they happened to alight in water too deep for\r\n     their legs, they swam readily, as do all shore birds. When\r\n     disturbed the dunlin utters a short _kuk_. Their call note is\r\n     distinctive, and resembles somewhat the word _purre_, by which name\r\n     the European species is called. The note is plaintive and sometimes\r\n     melodious, and recalls, without its harshness, the cry of the\r\n     common tern.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The earlier writers refer to this as an active, restless\r\nbird. Audubon (1840) says:\r\n\r\n     There seems to be a kind of impatience in this bird that prevents\r\n     it from remaining any length of time in the same place, and you may\r\n     see it scarcely alighted on a sand bar, fly off without any\r\n     apparent reason to another, where it settles, runs for a few\r\n     moments, and again starts off on wing.\r\n\r\nGiraud (1844) writes:\r\n\r\n     It is a restless active bird and gleans its food with great\r\n     nimbleness, and seems to be fond of continually changing its\r\n     position. Soon after alighting they collect together and make a\r\n     short excursion over the water, again alighting a short distance\r\n     from where they had previously taken wing. During their aerial\r\n     excursions, when whirling about, they crowd so close together that\r\n     many are killed at a single shot. On one of these occasions Mr.\r\n     Brasher informs me that he killed 52 by discharging both barrels\r\n     into a flock. This number is greater than I ever before heard of;\r\n     but from 10 to 15 is not unusual.\r\n\r\nWilson (1832), writing when shore birds were abundant, says of this\r\nflocking habit:\r\n\r\n     These birds, in conjunction with several others, sometimes collect\r\n     together in such flocks, as to seem, at a distance, a large cloud\r\n     of thick smoke, varying in form and appearance every instant, while\r\n     it performs its evolutions in air. As this cloud descends and\r\n     courses along the shores of the ocean, with great rapidity, in a\r\n     kind of waving, serpentine flight, alternately throwing its dark\r\n     and white plumage to the eye, it forms a very grand and interesting\r\n     appearance. At such times the gunners make prodigious slaughter\r\n     among them; while, as the showers of their companions fall, the\r\n     whole body often alight, or descend to the surface with them, till\r\n     the sportsman is completely satiated with destruction.\r\n\r\nSuckley (1860) found them equally abundant in the Puget Sound region,\r\nfor he writes:\r\n\r\n     Early in the season, before they have been rendered wild by being\r\n     much shot at, I have observed that upon a volley being fired into a\r\n     flock the unharmed birds in terror sweep around in several circles,\r\n     and hovering \"_bunch_,\" as the sportsmen say, over their wounded\r\n     companions, and sometimes realight with them. At the moment of\r\n     their hovering in a compact body over the wounded is the time\r\n     generally seized to fire the reserved barrels; two or three shots\r\n     will frequently bring down from 30 to 60 birds; and I have known\r\n     one instance where an officer of the Army bagged 96 birds from one\r\n     discharge of his fowling piece. After being fired into once or\r\n     twice the flocks, learning to avoid sympathizing with their dead\r\n     and wounded, become shy and wary.\r\n\r\nSeveral observers have remarked on the remarkable tameness of the\r\nred-backed sandpiper. William Brewster (1925) spent two hours\r\nphotographing five of these birds within 8 feet of his boat on an open\r\nmud flat; they paid no attention to his movements, the click of the\r\ncamera, or the flapping of the focusing cloth; \"during much of the time\r\nthey were apparently asleep;\" he even had difficulty in frightening them\r\naway until he splashed water on them. I have frequently walked up to\r\nwithin a few feet of feeding birds and had some difficulty in inducing\r\nthem to fly more than a short distance.\r\n\r\nTheir eyesight is keen enough, however, as shown by an incident related\r\nby W. E. Saunders (1896). A bird which had been feeding near him for\r\nabout an hour, stopped, looked steadily, as if afraid, and \"shrank down\r\nflat on the ground, where he lay perfectly still.\" After some time Mr.\r\nSaunders discovered an eagle approaching, so far away that he could\r\nhardly see him. After the eagle had passed the sandpiper resumed his\r\nfeeding.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The red-backed sandpiper is usually silent when on the ground.\r\nJohn T. Nichols, in his notes, calls the \"flushing note of a single bird\r\na fine _chit-l-it_. Its flight note is an emphatic near-whistled _chu_\r\nor _chru_, resembling some of the calls of the pectoral and semipalmated\r\nsandpipers, but quite diagnostic when one is sufficiently familiar with\r\nit. This call may also be phonetically suggested by the syllable\r\n_purre_, which is a colloquial name of the European dunlin, of which it\r\nis a race.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Townsend (1905) says: \"The note is plaintive and sometimes\r\nmelodious, and recalls, without its harshness, the cry of the common\r\ntern.\" Mr. Murdoch (1885) and others have noticed that the rolling call,\r\nheard on the breeding grounds in June, \"reminds one of the notes of the\r\nfrogs in New England in spring.\" A bird which Mr. Brewster (1925)\r\nflushed \"uttered a peculiarly mellow _tweet-twel-l-l-ut_ just as it rose\r\non wing.\"\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--In spring plumage the American dunlin deserves the name\r\nred backed, for its back is even redder than that of its European\r\nrelative; at that season the black patch on the belly is very\r\nconspicuous, even at a long distance, so that the species is easily\r\nrecognized. It is a short-legged, rather stocky bird, about the size of\r\nthe sanderling, and can be identified in the fall by its rather long and\r\nsomewhat curved bill and its dull, mouse-colored back. A narrow white\r\nstripe in the wing can be seen in flight.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Of their departure from Alaska, Doctor Nelson (1887) writes:\r\n\r\n     The young are mostly on the wing toward the end of July, and the\r\n     birds begin to gather into flocks along the muddy edges of the\r\n     brackish pools and the banks of tide creeks. Very soon after this\r\n     they begin to lose their summer plumage, and the molt continues\r\n     until the last of September or first of October. During the first\r\n     of October they are very common in flocks and singly among the\r\n     lakes and streams; a little later and the borders of these\r\n     situations are edged with ice and most of the birds leave for the\r\n     south, but some of the hardier ones betake themselves to the\r\n     seashore, where they join with Coues's sandpiper and remain as late\r\n     as the 12th or 13th of the month.\r\n\r\nThe southward migration separates into two widely divergent main routes,\r\nwith only stragglers between. One route is southward along the Pacific\r\ncoast and one southeastward along the west coast of Hudson Bay, through\r\nthe eastern Great Lakes, and to the coast of New England and farther\r\nsouth. E. A. Preble (1902) saw them on the west coast of Hudson Bay,\r\njust commencing the migration, on July 19, and \"present by thousands\"\r\nsouth of Cape Eskimo on August 3 to 13. It seems to be a rare bird in\r\nthe interior Provinces of Canada; my Manitoba correspondents have no\r\nfall records, and Professor Rowan has only one for Alberta. Mr. Brewster\r\n(1925) saw it regularly at Lake Umbagog, Maine, in October; and W. E.\r\nClyde Todd (1904) calls it common in Erie County, Pennsylvania; probably\r\nthese two points represent the north and south limits of the eastward\r\nroute. Mr. Todd (1904) quotes from Samuel E. Bacon's notes as follows:\r\n\r\n     In former years extensive flights took place about the 1st of\r\n     November, upon which occasions bushels of them are said to have\r\n     fallen to a single gun. During these great flights the flocks were\r\n     accustomed to follow the outside beach of the peninsula (having\r\n     presumably come directly across the lake) to its southeastern\r\n     extremity, thence crossing over to the sand beach east of the mouth\r\n     of Mill Creek, where, after having been sadly depleted by dozens of\r\n     guns, they would finally rise high in the air and pass southward\r\n     over the mainland, flock following flock, all day long. I know this\r\n     by hearsay only, but am positive that this is the bird that used to\r\n     arrive in such numbers late in the fall. On October 29, 1897, I\r\n     killed 53 of these birds out of two flocks, comprising in all\r\n     perhaps as many more, and this is the nearest approach to a flight\r\n     that has occurred of late years.\r\n\r\nThe redbacks do not reach the Massachusetts coast in any numbers until\r\nthe last week in September and the main flight comes in October, with\r\nsome lingering into November and a few remain all winter occasionally.\r\nWhile with us they frequent the ocean beaches and salt-water mud flats,\r\nwhere they associate with sanderlings, ringnecks, peep, and turnstones.\r\nDuring high tides they rest on the high, sandy beaches in the large\r\nflocks of other small waders. They fly in close flocks, low over the\r\nwater. The adults which come first, have nearly completed the body molt\r\nwhen they arrive here.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--It is only a short flight farther to their winter homes on\r\nour southern coast. Dr. Louis B. Bishop (1901) found this to be \"the\r\nmost abundant sandpiper\" on Pea Island, North Carolina, in winter.\r\nArthur T. Wayne (1910) says that it usually arrives in South Carolina\r\nabout the first week in October and remains until May 25. \"With the\r\nexception of the western sandpiper, this species is the most common of\r\nall the waders that winter on the coast. It is a very hardy bird and is\r\napparently not inconvenienced by a temperature of 6° above zero.\" We\r\nfound it common all winter on the coastal islands and mud flats on the\r\nwest coast of Florida. Mr. Nichols says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     Where met with on its winter range in northwest Florida it\r\n     apparently shifted its feeding grounds with high or low water, at\r\n     the particular locality in mind, more or less dependent on the\r\n     wind. When offshore winds caused low tides and extensive mud flats,\r\n     it was less numerous; when the water was high, numbers were seen\r\n     flying over the bay. They were present on inundated landward flats,\r\n     and, as the tide receded, fed along the edge of the bay near by,\r\n     wading in the water and often immersing most of the head as they\r\n     probed.\r\n\r\nAccording to J. Hooper Bowles (1918) they winter farther north on the\r\nPacific coast than on this side. He writes:\r\n\r\n     These birds are among the last of the Limicolae to arrive in the\r\n     fall migration, often reaching Washington after many of the other\r\n     species have left for the South. They make up for it, however, by\r\n     staying with us all winter and late into the spring. On the\r\n     Nisqually Flats I have seen them in flocks of hundreds when the\r\n     marsh was a solid pack of snow and ice, the rise and fall of the\r\n     tide making sufficient feeding grounds to keep them fat and strong.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North America and eastern Asia; casual in Central America and\r\nthe West Indies.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--North to northeastern Siberia (Taimyr Peninsula,\r\nNijni Kolymsk, Cape Wankarem, and East Cape); Alaska (Cape Prince of\r\nWales, Point Barrow, Colville Delta, and Camden Bay); Mackenzie (Cape\r\nBathurst, Mackenzie Bay, Franklin Bay, and Baillie Island); and Franklin\r\n(Port Kennedy). East to Franklin (Port Kennedy and Felix Harbor); and\r\nprobably eastern Keewatin (Cape Fullerton). South to probably eastern\r\nKeewatin (Cape Fullerton); northwestern Mackenzie (Great Slave Lake and\r\nPeel River); and Alaska (probably Nushagak and Ugashik). West to Alaska\r\n(Ugashik, Pastolik, Hooper Bay, and St. Michael); and northeastern\r\nSiberia (Cape Serdze, Plover Bay, and Taimyr Peninsula).

Among these\r\nare: Arizona, near Tucson, April, 1883; Nevada, Pyramid Lake, May, 1868;\r\nand Utah, Ogden and Salt Lake City (reported in September by Allen). It\r\nalso has been reported as detected at Dominica, West Indies, October 1,\r\n1904; and at Momotombo, Nicaragua, on May 23.

It\r\nhas been met with in Canada on two occasions, about ten times in the\r\nEastern States, twice in the West Indies and once in Patagonia.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Very few observations on this species have been made on\r\nits breeding grounds in eastern Siberia, so our information as to its\r\ncourtship is still very defective. The late Dr. H. Walter, during his\r\nenforced detention on the Taimyr Peninsula, from September, 1900, to\r\nAugust, 1901, while frozen in on board the exploring ship \"Sarja,\" noted\r\nthat they arrived on the Peninsula on June 13, and from that date onward\r\nwere to be met with chasing one another in little parties of three or\r\nfour over the tundra. There is no mention of any song flight (as in\r\n_Crocethia alba_, _Erolia temminchii_, _Arquatella maritima_, _Calidris\r\ncanutus_, etc.).\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The usual nesting place is on the gentle slope of the drier\r\ntundra, where the reindeer moss is interspersed with tufts of wiry grass\r\nand allowing a wide field of view over the neighborhood. Miss Haviland\r\n(1915_a_) noted that the actual nest hollow was rather deep, so that the\r\npointed ends of the eggs were pointed downwards almost vertically.\r\nWalter describes them as shallow depressions, lined with a few dry\r\nbents, but H. L. Popham (1898) also remarks that \"the nest was a rather\r\ndeep hollow amongst the reindeer moss in an open space on a ridge of\r\nground, somewhat drier than the surrounding swampy tundra, in much the\r\nsame sort of place as that generally chosen by a grey plover.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Middendorff undoubtedly met with birds about to breed, and\r\nindeed extracted a partly developed egg from the oviduct of a female\r\nwhich he had shot on the Boganida River in latitude 74° N., no one had\r\nactually found the nest of this species till Mr. H. Leyborne Popham\r\n(1898) visited the lower reaches of the Yenesei in 1897. Two years\r\npreviously (August, 1895), he had met with family parties on the delta\r\nand had shot young which must have been reared in the neighborhood. On\r\nJuly 3, 1897, finding the way below Golchika blocked by the ice, he\r\nturned back to explore an island of soft tundra with a rocky shore. One\r\nof his men called out that he had seen a sandpiper and at once,\r\naccording to his own words:\r\n\r\n     I sent the other two men away and lay down to watch the bird, which\r\n     stood still for some time, then flew some distance away and I lost\r\n     sight of it among some turnstones. We again saw the bird near the\r\n     same spot, so Hansen and I lay down to watch while the mosquitoes\r\n     did their worst. The bird stood for some time watching us and then\r\n     began running about; it was very difficult to keep it in sight for\r\n     it took advantage of every little hollow to run in and every little\r\n     ridge to hide behind. It then flew to another place and did the\r\n     same thing again, so I asked Hansen to get up and walk away. The\r\n     bird remained quite motionless, watching him go, and then ran\r\n     backwards and forwards and finally stopped still behind a small\r\n     tuft of grass. After waiting for some minutes I raised my head\r\n     slightly; the bird instantly flew off and stood watching, but, as\r\n     it saw nothing moving, it began running about again and settled\r\n     down in the same spot; then I felt sure I had a nest safe, but to\r\n     make doubly sure I went through the same performance again, a\r\n     shower of rain no doubt hastening matters, and this time I\r\n     distinctly saw the bird shuffle the eggs under it. I jumped up,\r\n     shot the bird as it ran away, and soon had the pleasure of looking\r\n     at the first authentic eggs of the curlew sandpiper. The bird,\r\n     which proved to be the female, remained silent throughout; at one\r\n     time I thought I heard it make a sound like a dunlin, but, as I\r\n     afterwards saw dunlins close by, I was probably mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe next news comes from the Russian explorers who wintered on the coast\r\nof the Taimyr Peninsula in 1900-1901. In Doctor Walter's posthumous\r\nnotes he writes that the curlew sandpiper nested in numbers near his\r\nwinter quarters. The nests were placed in grassy places and by mid-June\r\n(old style) contained full clutches. On the approach of anyone the\r\nsitting birds, warned by their mates, left the nests quickly and both\r\nbirds remained very passive and unobtrusive. Usually a long wait was\r\nnecessary before the female returned to the nest, and often the watch\r\nresulted in failure. Some individuals also wander about in flocks\r\nthrough the breeding season, and later on young and old collect in large\r\nflocks and stay till late in the autumn. Doctor Walter collected three\r\nclutches of eggs here, and another Russian naturalist, Dr. Katin\r\nJartzew, also took several on Kotelni Island, in the New Siberian Isles,\r\nin 1902. Since that date the only information we have received is that\r\nfurnished by Miss Haviland (Mrs. Brindley), who visited the delta of the\r\nYenesei in 1914. In her account (1915) of her travels she writes:\r\n\r\n     On July 6, as I was returning from a long round over the tundra\r\n     that lay in the northern angle of the Yenesei and Golchika Rivers,\r\n     all at once I saw a little rufous curlew, which was standing on a\r\n     tussock about 20 yards away, watching me quietly. When I stopped\r\n     she flew away, but soon alighted again and looked at me. Full of\r\n     excitement, but still rather skeptical as to the likelihood of\r\n     finding eggs, I lay down and watched her, but at the end of an hour\r\n     and a half I could come to no conclusion, for the bird only\r\n     strolled about and preened herself nonchalantly. I was not even\r\n     certain of her sex, and her solitude and her quiet behavior made me\r\n     doubt whether, after all, she might not be a nonbreeding bird.\r\n     Nevertheless, I marked the place and turned homeward, meaning to\r\n     come back next day. On the morrow I turned out early and tramped\r\n     over 8 swampy miles of tundra. The second pair of sandpipers were\r\n     not to be seen, but the first bird was still pottering round the\r\n     same spot. To-day she was a little more demonstrative and flew\r\n     about uneasily. Once she uttered a sharp, anxious note,\r\n     _wick-wick-wick_, two or three times repeated. By this time I was\r\n     convinced that the nest was close at hand, but it was difficult to\r\n     locate it, for although the bird could dodge me successfully enough\r\n     behind tussocks of moss only 6 inches high, my person unfortunately\r\n     was too bulky for these, the only available hiding places. The\r\n     ground was on a very gradual slope. On the right hand and on the\r\n     left were two small tarns, still covered with blue ice. In the\r\n     distance grazed some herds of reindeer, and once a Samoyede sledge\r\n     glided swiftly over a ridge. Heavy drifts of snow still lay in the\r\n     sheltered hollow, and the sleet showers that came slapping over the\r\n     tundra made me glad to wrap myself up in my Burberry coat.\r\n\r\nThe bird had whirled away round the tarn at my approach, so I hid myself\r\nas well as I could behind a tussock and settled down to wait for her\r\nreturn. Twenty minutes passed--half an hour. \"It's time she was coming\r\nback,\" thought I, and turned my head carefully to reconnoiter. And lo\r\nand behold, not 30 yards behind, the sandpiper stood and studied me\r\ncontemptuously! She had been watching all the time. \"What a fool!\"\r\ndoubtless would have been her comment if she could have spoken. It is no\r\nuse to try and gull the waders; up to a certain point I believe that\r\nthey can almost see you _think_!\r\n\r\nI retired abashed to another hiding place about 50 yards farther up the\r\nslope. The bird at once showed her appreciation of this move by flying\r\ntoward the spot where I had first seen her. She was so small that it was\r\nvery difficult to mark her as she tripped between the tussocks. When I\r\nthought that she must be settled on her eggs I jumped up quickly. She\r\ntook wing at once, but when I went to the place whence she had risen\r\nthere was no sign of the nest. This happened twice; but as she returned\r\nto the same spot each time, I knew that the treasure was there all right\r\nand that patience would win it. I marked the bird down by a dodge that I\r\nused when looking for gray plover's eggs under similar circumstances and\r\nwhich is described elsewhere; but each time that I flushed her she\r\nseemed to jump up from a different place. She was so little and so\r\nnimble that she could run over the moss for some yards before she was\r\nseen. The next time I gave her ample time to settle down and lay still\r\nin the wet, sucking lumps of sugar until I nearly fell asleep. Then all\r\nat once a Buffon's skua came overhead, flying low in the squally wind. I\r\nsnatched my gun and shot him as he flew by, and as he fell I saw the\r\nsandpiper spring up from a spot where I had marked her once before. I\r\nleft the skua and ran up to the place. The bird began to call again and\r\ndrooped a wing to decoy me away. Half a minute's search and there was\r\nthe nest at my feet.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The clutch consists of four eggs normally, blunt pyriform in\r\nshape with slight gloss. Walter describes the ground as pale yellowish\r\nwhite with greenish tinge and large and small blackish-brown spots, more\r\nconfluent at large end. There are also a few pale violet-gray shell\r\nmarks. They are snipelike in character, and the markings are rich and\r\nhandsome, sometimes ranging to deep rufous brown in color. Their small\r\nsize, combined with bold type of markings, renders them readily\r\nrecognizable. The measurements of 20 eggs average 36.26 by 25.67\r\nmillimeters, the eggs showing the four extremes measure =39.6= by 25.6,\r\n37.5 by =26.4=, =33.3= by 25.3, and 36.6 by =25= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Incubation._--The bird which Popham shot from the eggs was a female,\r\nbut both males and females were obtained from the nests by the Russian\r\nornithologists, so that apparently the duty is shared by both sexes.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The molts and plumages are fully described in \"A Practical\r\nHandbook of British Birds,\" edited by H. F. Witherby (1920), to which\r\nthe reader is referred.\r\n\r\n_Food._--On its breeding grounds the main food of this species consists\r\nof insects. Cordeaux has found remains of Coleoptera and Diptera and\r\ntheir larvae in stomachs. Worms are also freely taken, but on migration\r\nit is a coastal species and subsists chiefly on marine forms, such as\r\nthe small crustacea (Gammaridae) which are found in vast numbers on the\r\nshore, minute mollusca, and vegetable matter.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Even in the breeding season this species shows signs of a\r\nsociable disposition, several pairs breeding frequently at no great\r\ndistance apart. When the young are fledged they assemble in flocks\r\nbefore leaving for the south and during the winter months may be found\r\non the mud flats of our estuaries and flat coasts, as well as\r\noccasionally on reservoirs and sewage farms inland. During the breeding\r\nseason it appears to be a silent bird, only a shrill alarm note,\r\n_wick-wick-wick_, being noted, while the shore haunting flocks keep up a\r\nlong twitter.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--The migrations of this species are very extensive, reaching\r\nover practically the whole of the Old World. To the British Isles it is\r\na passage migrant, arriving from the end of July to late October and\r\noccasionally November. In Denmark the old birds are said to arrive in\r\nAugust and the birds of the year in September, leaving in\r\nSeptember-October. On the shores of the Baltic it occurs commonly, but\r\nseems to avoid the extreme west of Europe on its way south, though\r\npassing Tangier in September and occurring in small numbers in Portugal.\r\nIt is also met with on passage in all the Mediterranean countries, as\r\nwell as north Africa and passes the Canaries on migration. It ranges on\r\nthe west side of Africa to Gaboon, Liberia, the Gold Coast, Princes\r\nIsland, Loango, and south to Cape Province. While on the east side it is\r\nrecorded from the Nile Valley, the Red Sea, Sudan, Mozambique, Zanzibar,\r\nNyassaland, Madagascar, etc., and it occurs regularly on Mauritius. In\r\nAsia it ranges across the continent to the Indian Ocean, the Mekran\r\ncoast, Sind, Yarkand, India, Ceylon, the Andamans Nicobars, Burmese\r\ncoast, Malacca Peninsula, Hainan, Formosa, and East China. Further, it\r\nhas been recorded from the Malay Archipelago, Java, Borneo, New Guinea,\r\nthe Philippines, Moluccas, and has also been found in Australia (West\r\nAustralia and New South Wales), Tasmania, and New Zealand. In America\r\nthere are two Canadian records, one from Toronto and one from Nova\r\nScotia; while in the Eastern States it has occurred in Maine,\r\nMassachusetts, New Jersey, and Long Island, and has been recorded from\r\nGrenada and Carriacou, Lesser Antilles, and also in Patagonia. In Alaska\r\nit has once been obtained at Point Barrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The supposed instances of breeding in western\r\nGreenland are now discredited, and the only definitely known breeding\r\nplaces are in eastern Siberia, from the delta of the Yenesei to latitude\r\n74° on the Taimyr Peninsula and northward, as well as on the Liakhof\r\nIsles and other islands of the New Siberian group.\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--Dates: Rio de Oro (N. W. Africa), April 27;\r\nGibraltar, April 24; Egypt, May 8; Barcelona and Santander, May; Malaga,\r\nMay 9; Corsica, May 7, 8, and 16; Italy, April 1-June 5: Malta, May 7,\r\n12, 13, 27; Greece, April 15, 28, but chiefly May; Corfu, passage lasts\r\ntill end of May; Transylvania, May 29; Cyprus, May 20, 24; Lake Baikal,\r\nMay; Allaliabad, May 17; Amoy, China, May 16; Archangel, June 18;\r\nBoganida River, May 27; arrives North Taimyr, June 4.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--Dates: Belfast, Ireland, August 25 to end of\r\nSeptember; Portugal, September; Italy, September 15-October 30; Cyprus,\r\nSeptember 2; Greece, arrives September; Tangier, September; Yarkand,\r\nAugust-September; Karachi, September; Gilgit, August-September;\r\nSelangor, August; Mergui Archipelago, November 6; Ceylon, October; Lower\r\nPegu, August; Transvaal, November 24; Natal, October 18.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--Aldabra Island, Madagascar, November 6; Madeira,\r\nApril 30, September 22 and October 7 and November 27. New Zealand,\r\nCanterbury, February 3, 1902; April 5, 1903 (2); Otago, March, 1903;\r\nGrenada (Wells); Bering Island (Steller). There are several records for\r\nthis species for North America, some dating back to the earlier days of\r\nAmerican ornithology. In some cases the details are indefinite and can\r\nnot be considered as absolutely trustworthy. Among the occurrences\r\nrecorded are: Lesser Antilles, Grenada (Cory, 1892), and Carriacou\r\n(Clark, 1905); New Jersey, Great Egg Harbor, two in the spring of 1829,\r\nLong Beach, Barnegat Bay, July 29, 1904, and Tuckerton and Cape May\r\n(Stone, according to C. C. Abbott, 1868); New York, nearly a dozen\r\nspecimens at Fulton market secured on Long Island (Giraud, 1844), Long\r\nIsland (?)

Joseph Dixon (1918)\r\nsays: \"There are but three specimens claimed to have been taken in North\r\nAmerica, as far as known to the author, with some doubt attached to the\r\nlocality of capture of one of these.\" He has shown that the bird\r\nsupposed to have been taken on the Choris Peninsula, Kotzebue Sound,\r\nAlaska, by Captain Moore, of the British ship \"Plover,\" was really taken\r\nin northeastern Asia in 1849, and that no authentic record for North\r\nAmerica has been established since that time until 1914. He says\r\nfurther:\r\n\r\n     The only well-established occurrence of the spoonbilled sandpiper\r\n     in America is that vouched for by Fred Granville, of Los Angeles,\r\n     California, who, on August 15, 1914, took two specimens at\r\n     Wainwright Inlet, on the Arctic coast of Alaska. One of these\r\n     specimens, a female, is now number 3552 in the collection of A. B.\r\n     Howell, of Covina, California, while the other, a male, is number\r\n     1698 in the collection of G. Willett, of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nReferring to the capture of these two birds, he quotes from Mr.\r\nGranville's letter of January 9, 1918, as follows:\r\n\r\n     On August 15, 1914, I and my assistant hiked back of Wainwright to\r\n     what I judged to be a distance of about 10 miles, traveling in a\r\n     northerly direction. The tundra where I found the spoonbills was\r\n     interlaced as far as the eye could see with little lagoons and long\r\n     channels of water, and in this territory I collected the two\r\n     spoonbills. These birds were shot out of a flock of possibly 10. I\r\n     followed them for about an hour before I could get a shot at them.\r\n     The birds would run along the tundra en masse and were undoubtedly\r\n     gleaning food from the moss. The minute they would catch sight of\r\n     me they would fly out of shotgun range. There were about six birds\r\n     that looked to me through field glasses to be in markedly different\r\n     plumage from the birds I shot. These six birds, immature as I\r\n     supposed, seemed to be of a solid color, and that a dark gray. On\r\n     the first shot fired, with which I got two, the birds flew across a\r\n     lake and I lost track of them, though I spent four or five hours\r\n     looking for some more. I believe that these birds breed in the\r\n     neighborhood of Wainwright and hope that at some close future date\r\n     some one will bear out my statement.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--There is an adult male in nuptial plumage in the British\r\nMuseum, which was taken at Shanghai, China, in April. The only other\r\ninformation we have about the spring migration is the following brief\r\nstatement by Dr. E. W. Nelson (1883):\r\n\r\n     On the northeast coast of Siberia Nordenskiold records this bird as\r\n     occurring in such numbers that on two occasions in spring it was\r\n     served upon their mess table on board the \"Vega\" while they were\r\n     lying frozen in at their winter quarters. It arrived in spring at\r\n     Tapkau, with the first bare spots, early in June, and disappeared\r\n     in July. To the westward, in the same vicinity, during the summer\r\n     of 1881, I saw several of these birds, and at Plover Bay, on the\r\n     Bering Sea shore of the same coast, secured a fine adult female in\r\n     breeding plumage, taken on June 26. Nothing peculiar was observed\r\n     in its habits, and I approached the bird without difficulty or its\r\n     showing the slightest concern as it stood on the flat at that\r\n     place. The bird was first seen feeding in the shallow water at the\r\n     edge of a pool, and then stood with its head drawn back and without\r\n     paying the slightest attention to me until it was shot.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Mr. Dixon (1918) has made a thorough study of this species\r\nand has given us a fine account of its interesting song flight,\r\nillustrated by a diagram, from which I quote, as follows:\r\n\r\n     The song and nuptial flight of the male spoonbill, attractive as\r\n     they were to the collector, in sight of such rare birds at last,\r\n     were as elusive as a will-o'-the-wisp. In fact we were never able\r\n     to locate a female spoonbill on the nest, and I have always\r\n     believed that our lack of success in this regard was due to the\r\n     warning given by the male. Upon approaching the nest site, while we\r\n     were yet afar off, we were greeted by the male in full song. This\r\n     song, ventriloquial, pulsating, and cicadalike in quality, seemed\r\n     to come first from one and then from another point in the heaven\r\n     above. Sometimes we searched the sky altogether in vain, but\r\n     usually the bird was discovered in rapid flight at an altitude of\r\n     two or three hundred feet above the earth. The nuptial flight\r\n     consists of momentary poises alternating with rapid dips. When the\r\n     bird hovers or poises, the rapid beating of the wings is\r\n     accompanied by a fine, rhythmical, pulsating, buzzing trill,\r\n     _zee-e-e, zee-e-e, zee-e-e_, rapidly repeated. Following this the\r\n     bird approaches the intruder, swinging down in a sharp curve until\r\n     10 feet lower than the previous hovering point, where he again\r\n     poises on rapidly beating wings, pouring forth anew his insistent,\r\n     musical trill. After repeating this performance four or five times\r\n     the songster sweeps down in a long graceful curve until he almost\r\n     touches the earth near his brooding mate, then curving off, he\r\n     turns and rises rapidly and almost perpendicularly until almost out\r\n     of sight. From this new point of vantage the whole performance is\r\n     repeated. After four or five such excursions, in each of which the\r\n     intruder is approached from a different direction, the guardian of\r\n     the nest descends by raising his wings nearly vertically until they\r\n     form in anterior outline the letter V. The bird thus gliding on\r\n     motionless wings drops lightly but quickly to earth, uttering the\r\n     _zee-e-e_ in a richer yet more subdued tone. As soon as he touches\r\n     the earth the song ceases and the silent bird trots quietly off\r\n     over the moss, where his trim form blends with the lichen and mossy\r\n     tussocks, so that, upon remaining motionless, he disappears with\r\n     amazing rapidity. Time and time again we thus lost sight of the\r\n     birds, which we later discovered by the aid of binoculars to be\r\n     standing or squatting motionless within 50 feet of us. Although\r\n     this \"fading out\" method of exit is commonly employed by many shore\r\n     birds, in the case of the spoonbilled sandpiper it seems to have\r\n     been developed to an extreme degree.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--To F. E. Kleinschmidt is due the credit for finding the\r\nfirst nest of the spoonbill sandpiper near Cape Serdze, northeastern\r\nSiberia, on July 15, 1910. The nest and the four eggs, which were nearly\r\nhatched, are now in the collection of Col. John E. Thayer. The following\r\nextract from Captain Kleinschmidt's letter in regard to it was published\r\nby Colonel Thayer (1911):\r\n\r\n     I was in hopes that I could get five or six clutches of the\r\n     spoonbills, so I took all kinds of chances with my boat in the ice\r\n     on the Siberian coast. I found, however, but one set of eggs and\r\n     they were just ready to hatch. The male is the parent bird of the\r\n     eggs, but the female belongs to neither eggs nor downies, simply\r\n     because the habits of this sandpiper are similar to those of the\r\n     phalarope. The male has to stay at home, keep house, and attend to\r\n     the young, while the female thinks she has done all that is\r\n     necessary by merely fulfilling the duties nature demands of her,\r\n     namely, the laying of the eggs. I shot the female in close\r\n     proximity of the nest, but we never found a female with the\r\n     downies. It was always the male. Although our observations were\r\n     limited to but a few, still I believe the male solely attends to\r\n     the hatching and the rearing of the young. The female also is\r\n     larger than the male. The nest as well as the downies were found on\r\n     the gentle slope of the tundra, bordering small fresh-water ponds.\r\n     The nest was a rounded hollow in the moss, thickly lined with dry\r\n     willow leaves. The downies blend so perfectly with the color of the\r\n     moss that the closest scrutiny will scarcely reveal their hiding\r\n     place.\r\n\r\nMr. Dixon (1918) found a nest, with two fresh eggs, near Providence Bay,\r\nSiberia, on June 22, 1913, and one, with three young just hatched, near\r\nCape Serdze, on July 17, 1913. Regarding his experience with it, he\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     The two nests of this bird that came under the author's observation\r\n     were discovered through flushing the brooding male. The birds were\r\n     very shy, and as there was no cover other than a thin growth of\r\n     grass about 6 inches high approach by stealth was difficult. The\r\n     birds usually sneaked off while the observer was 40 or 50 yards\r\n     distant, and in order to find the nest it was necessary to hide, as\r\n     best one could, near the place where the sandpiper had flushed,\r\n     until it returned again to the nest. In one instance a depression\r\n     partly filled with water was the only available hiding place.\r\n     Fortunately for the watcher the water was not cold and the male\r\n     bird returned in 12 minutes to the nest, which contained two\r\n     _fresh_ eggs. The nest of this sandpiper was found to be merely a\r\n     cavity scratched out among the dead grass blades. It was a shallow\r\n     affair placed where the grass grew thickest. On June 22, 1913, at\r\n     Providence Bay, the writer witnessed the construction of a nest\r\n     from a distance of about 40 feet. The bird, a male, scratched and\r\n     then picked at the dead and matted grass blades and moss until he\r\n     had dug out quite a hole. Then he squatted down in the depression\r\n     and twisted about, pressing against the moss that formed the sides\r\n     of the nest, until a cavity about 3-1/2 inches in diameter and an\r\n     inch deep was formed. Dead leaves from a creeping Arctic willow\r\n     that grew in the moss near-by were used to line the nest.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of eggs, one of three and one of two, in the United\r\nStates National Museum, taken by Louis L. Lane, at Cape Serdze in June,\r\n1912, but no further data came with them.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The small sets referred to above were probably incomplete;\r\ndoubtless four eggs is the normal set. The six eggs in the Thayer\r\ncollection are subpyriform in shape and have a slight gloss. The ground\r\ncolor is uniform in all of them; it is between \"cinnamon buff\" and \"dark\r\nolive buff,\" or a warm shade of the latter. Three eggs are finely\r\nspeckled all over, only a little more thickly at the larger end, with\r\nlight browns, \"tawny\" and \"snuff brown\"; one egg is heavily blotched at\r\nthe larger end with \"Verona brown\" and \"warm sepia,\" and only sparingly\r\nspotted elsewhere.\r\n\r\nJ. H. Riley tells me that the eggs taken by Louis Lane vary in ground\r\ncolor from a warm tint of \"dark olive buff\" to \"deep olive buff.\" The\r\nset of two is rather evenly but not heavily marked over the surface with\r\nsmall blotches, dots, and scrawls of two shades of \"bister,\" with a few\r\nshell markings of \"drab\" here and there over the surface. One egg of the\r\nset has the \"bister\" markings larger and thicker on the large end. The\r\nother set has the spots larger and heavier at the large end, and in two\r\neggs they are darker, \"clove brown\" or even \"blackish brown.\" The shape\r\nis subpyriform.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of these 11 eggs average 30.4 by 21.8 millimeters; the\r\neggs showing the four extremes measure =33= by 22.8, 30.5 by =23.3=,\r\n=28.7= by 20.8, and 29.3 by =20.3= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Regarding incubation and care of the young, Mr. Dixon (1918)\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     Regarding the time required for incubation, we have only\r\n     circumstantial evidence to offer, but our observations lead us to\r\n     believe that about 18 or 20 days elapse between the time the last\r\n     egg is laid and the first young hatched. The most striking fact in\r\n     the domestic life of the spoonbilled sandpiper is that the major\r\n     portion of the household duties, aside from the actual laying of\r\n     the eggs, is performed by the male and not the female bird. In\r\n     addition to our own observations, Kleinschmidt also has found this\r\n     to be the case. In the author's experience, none of the several\r\n     females taken were found on or within 50 feet of the nest. It is\r\n     possible, however, that they may have been warned by the male birds\r\n     and had sneaked off before we were close enough to detect their\r\n     leaving. In the unequal division of domestic duties conditions\r\n     among the spoonbills are similar to those among the phalaropes,\r\n     where the male, after he has been courted and won by the larger and\r\n     more brilliant female, takes upon himself almost all of the\r\n     household cares. However, in the case of the spoonbilled sandpiper\r\n     there is nothing to show that the female does the courting,\r\n     although she is the larger of the two. The female spoonbill is thus\r\n     seemingly content to merely lay the eggs, while she lets the male\r\n     build the nest, incubate the eggs, and take care of the young. In\r\n     corroboration of the latter statements, the author observed a male\r\n     bird building a nest at Providence Bay, Siberia, June 22, 1913;\r\n     another male was flushed repeatedly from a nest containing two\r\n     fresh eggs near the same place, on the same day, while a third male\r\n     was found tending three downy young at Cape Serdze, Siberia, on\r\n     July 17, 1913.\r\n\r\n     On July 17, 1913, at Cape Serdze, Siberia, while strolling along\r\n     the spongy green turf beside a fresh-water pond, my attention was\r\n     attracted by the \"broken wing\" antics of a spoonbilled sandpiper.\r\n     Although my eyes remained \"glued\" on the spot from which the bird\r\n     arose, no nest or sign of young could be found when I reached the\r\n     place. Soon a second bird, presumably the female, arrived on the\r\n     scene. Both appeared much concerned, and from their actions I felt\r\n     sure that there were young near by. A careful search of the short\r\n     grass, which was not over 2 inches high, failed to reveal any\r\n     living creature. I therefore retired to a grassy mound about 20\r\n     yards away and awaited developments. Both parent birds, giving\r\n     their alarm notes, circled about overhead, where they were soon\r\n     joined by a pair each of Eastern least and Temminck's stints. The\r\n     two pairs of stints were later found to have broods of downy young\r\n     in the grass on the opposite shore of the lagoon near by. Soon both\r\n     spoonbills flew off across the lagoon and disappeared, but the male\r\n     returned promptly, alighting quietly near the margin of the pond.\r\n     Here he stood motionless for nearly a minute, and then trotted\r\n     through the grass directly to the spot from which I had first\r\n     flushed him. At this point he stood still for another full minute,\r\n     during which time he looked all around, seemingly to make sure that\r\n     the coast was clear. Having satisfied himself that no active enemy\r\n     was in sight he stepped forward and bending over uttered a soft\r\n     call in a low tone, _plee-plee-plee_. This call was repeated a\r\n     second time, and instantly there arose directly in front of him a\r\n     tiny mouse-like brown form, seemingly rising from out of the very\r\n     ground. With tottering unsteady steps the downy young sandpiper\r\n     stumbled and fell toward the parent, who continued calling and\r\n     encouraging it. Upon my sudden appearance the old bird gave a quick\r\n     warning note and at this signal the youngster squatted motionless\r\n     with neck stretched forward on the ground. Although I knew the\r\n     exact spot where it disappeared, it was some time before I was able\r\n     to locate the tiny form, so well did it blend with the clump of\r\n     reddish moss upon which it had squatted. A careful search revealed\r\n     no other young sandpipers, so I returned to my hiding place. This\r\n     time I had to wait longer for the male to return, and while I was\r\n     waiting a second sandpiper, which I believed to be the female,\r\n     arrived but did not go near or call the young. Two or three minutes\r\n     elapsed this time between the return of the male and the giving of\r\n     the low call notes, when, as before, another downy young quickly\r\n     arose at the signal and toddled over to its parent. After this\r\n     second experience I was forced to change my hiding place, as the\r\n     male sandpiper refused to return to the young until I moved. He\r\n     seemed much concerned upon this last visit, probably realizing that\r\n     it was high time the young should be hovered and warmed.\r\n\r\n     I could not understand why all the young had not risen at once in\r\n     answer to the parent's call, but I noticed that he had in each case\r\n     gone up to within less than two feet of the one in hiding, and then\r\n     with lowered head facing the chick, gave the call note. In each\r\n     case it was the youngster thus directly addressed that responded to\r\n     the signal and arose. The note of the young was a low rusty squeak,\r\n     scarcely audible to human ears. It was very similar to the note of\r\n     the young semipalmated sandpiper. As far as my observations went,\r\n     there was no attempt on the part of the parent to feed the young,\r\n     and it is my belief that from the time they are hatched the young\r\n     spoonbills hunt their own food. The exercise thus gained was found\r\n     in the case of young semipalmated sandpipers to be essential to the\r\n     health of the chicks. In addition to keeping warm by running about\r\n     the young spoonbills are hovered and warmed at regular intervals by\r\n     the parent. The brood mentioned above had survived a fairly severe\r\n     snowstorm on the preceding day.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The most remarkable thing about the downy young spoonbill\r\nsandpiper is the well developed spoon-shaped bill, even when first\r\nhatched. As will be seen by referring to Colonel Thayer's (1911)\r\nexcellent colored plate, this is much shorter than the adult bill and\r\nthe spatulate tip is more oval. The crown, back, rump, wings, and thighs\r\nare variegated with black, white, \"ochraceous tawny\" and paler buffs,\r\ndotted with white terminal tufts on the head, which form two white\r\nstripes from the eyes to the nape, and dotted with both white and buff\r\ntufts on the back and rump; the forehead, a superciliary stripe, the\r\nsides of the head, the throat, and the neck are \"warm buff\"; the rest of\r\nthe under parts are white; a median frontal stripe, a loral stripe, and\r\na malar spot are black.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage I have never seen. Birds collected on the southward\r\nmigration are apparently all in winter plumages; young birds are\r\ndistinguishable from adults at this age. For descriptions of first\r\nwinter and subsequent plumages I would refer the reader to Ridgway's\r\nBirds of North and Middle America. I have not studied sufficient\r\nmaterial to work out the seasonal molts, but they are apparently similar\r\nto those of other small sandpipers of the genus _Pisobia_.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The food of the spoonbill sandpiper seems not to have been\r\ndefinitely determined, but Mr. Dixon (1918) watched a pair feeding, of\r\nwhich he says:\r\n\r\n     Our observations disclosed no peculiar advantage attending the\r\n     singular shape of this sandpiper's bill, though careful watch was\r\n     kept to see just how this member was used. On July 17, 1913, a pair\r\n     of spoonbilled sandpipers was watched for half an hour as the two\r\n     birds fed within 50 feet of the observer, concealed behind a sandy\r\n     dune. Their favorite feeding ground was a fresh-water pond with a\r\n     fringe of green algae about the sandy border. Under these\r\n     conditions the birds used their bills, as any other sandpipers\r\n     would, as probes to pick out insects or larvae from the algae.\r\n     Occasionally one would hesitate a moment, when the vascular tip of\r\n     the mandible quivered slightly as though the bird were straining\r\n     something out of the green algae. At this time the bill was held at\r\n     nearly right angles to the surface of the water; it was never used\r\n     as a scoop along the surface.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--I must again quote from Mr. Dixon (1918), who has furnished\r\nmost of our information about this little known species. Referring to\r\nbehavior and recognition marks he writes:\r\n\r\n     In color, size, and actions the spoonbilled sandpiper closely\r\n     resembles the Eastern least stint (_Pisobia minuta ruficollis_),\r\n     the marked similarity between them resulting in both the author and\r\n     his fellow collector W. S. Brooks, failing to distinguish between\r\n     the two species until June 20, after we had been among them for\r\n     some days. Although the spatulate tip of this bird's bill is very\r\n     noticeable when viewed from directly above or below, it is not a\r\n     character which can be advantageously used to identify the species\r\n     in the field, for the simple reason that in nearly all close views\r\n     of the living bird only lateral or frontal aspects of the bill are\r\n     obtained. Even when a bird was feeding, and the bill was observed\r\n     under the most favorable conditions, the peculiar shape was not\r\n     nearly as conspicuous as one would expect. In the author's\r\n     experience, the most reliable method of identifying the bird in the\r\n     field was by noting the glint of light that was reflected from the\r\n     broad tip of the upper mandible when the sunlight struck the bill\r\n     at a certain angle. Even in flight the bird could often be\r\n     identified by this faint beam of reflected light. We found that the\r\n     sandpiper had a decided preference for the grassy margins of\r\n     fresh-water ponds, while single birds were frequently found feeding\r\n     along the algae-bordered rims of tundra pools. Sandy lagoons where\r\n     rivers entered the bay were favored by them as well.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--The same writer outlines the fall migration, based on birds in\r\nthe British Museum, as follows:\r\n\r\n     An adult male, still in summer plumage, was taken August 8, at the\r\n     mouth of the Amur River in southwestern Russia. An immature was\r\n     secured on October 8 at Hakodadi (Hakodate), Japan, while an adult\r\n     female was collected at Rangoon, India, on December 1.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--In their winter home in India, according to Doctor Nelson\r\n(1887) \"these birds frequent the muddy flats at the mouths of rivers,\r\nsand bars, and the seashore, where, with the various species of\r\n_Tringa_, they always find an abundant harvest of food deposited by the\r\nreceding tide.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Eastern Siberia, south in winter to southern China and India;\r\ncasual in Alaska.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The spoonbilled sandpiper has been found breeding\r\nonly along the Arctic coast of northeast Siberia (Cape Wankarem,\r\nPithkaj, Cape Serdze, near Koliuchin Island, and Providence Bay).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The winter range of this species appears to be mainly\r\non the coasts of India (Rangoon, Akyab, Tenasserim, and the Arakan\r\ncoast).\r\n\r\n_Migration._--Specimens have been collected at Shanghai, China, in April\r\nand it seems to arrive on its breeding grounds early in June (Emma\r\nHarbor, Siberia, June 6). An early date of fall arrival is indicated by\r\na specimen from the mouth of the Amur River, southwestern Russia, taken\r\non August 8, while a late date of fall departure is October 8, at\r\nHakodadi, Japan.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--A specimen of this sandpiper has been reported as\r\ntaken on the Choris Peninsula, Alaska, in 1849 (Harting, 1871), but\r\nsubsequent investigation (Dixon, 1918) indicates that the bird was\r\nprobably taken on the Siberian side of Bering Strait. Two specimens\r\nwere, however, taken near Wainwright Inlet, on August 15, 1914 (Dixon,\r\n1918).\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Siberia: 2 records, June 22 and July 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nEREUNETES PUSILLUS (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\nSEMIPALMATED SANDPIPER\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\n_Contributed by Charles Wendell Townsend_\r\n\r\nThis little sandy colored sandpiper, appropriately called the \"sand\r\npeep,\" seems most at home on the sea beaches, but it also frequents the\r\nsand flats of tidal estuaries, and to a less extent, the salt marshes,\r\nand is even found on the shores of inland lakes during the migrations.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Although I have never seen this bird on its northern\r\nbreeding grounds, I have been so fortunate as to have heard many times\r\nthe courtship song during the migrations on the New England coast, and\r\nto have witnessed some, at least, of its posturing on the ground. This\r\nsandpiper is more of a musician than the least, and his song is well\r\nworth hearing. I can but repeat what I have already published on the\r\nsubject (1905):\r\n\r\n     Rising on quivering wings to about 30 feet from the ground, the\r\n     bird advances with rapid wing beats, curving the pinions strongly\r\n     downward, pouring forth a succession of musical notes--a continuous\r\n     quavering trill--and ending with a few very sweet notes that recall\r\n     those of a goldfinch. He then descends to the ground where one may\r\n     be lucky enough, if near at hand, to hear a low musical _cluck_\r\n     from the excited bird. This is, I suppose, the full love flight\r\n     song, and is not often heard in its entirety, but the first\r\n     quavering trill is not uncommon, a single bird or member of a flock\r\n     singing this as he flies over.\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Grinnell (1900) writes as follows of this species at Cape\r\nBlossom, Alaska, in July:\r\n\r\n     A few were to be found in the Interior on damp, grassy flats, but\r\n     the strip of low meadow bordering the lagoon back of the mission\r\n     was by far the most popular resort. Here the grass was short and\r\n     smooth as a lawn, with occasional narrow branches from the main\r\n     slough cutting their way back toward the higher ground. In one part\r\n     of this stretch of tide flats the sandpipers were so numerous that\r\n     as many as a dozen pairs were in sight at once, and their\r\n     twittering notes were to be heard on all sides. They were flying\r\n     back and forth over the meadows chasing one another, with shrill,\r\n     rolling notes uttered so continuously as to become almost inaudible\r\n     from their monotony. At times in an individual case this trilling\r\n     would become so intensified as to remind one of the shrill notes of\r\n     the white throated swift.\r\n\r\nJoseph Dixon (1917_a_), writing of a bird that sang at an elevation of\r\nabout 50 feet above the nest says: \"His song seemed to come from every\r\ndirection, and this illusion was difficult to account for even by the\r\nunusual location of the songster.\" Whether the _whinny_ heard from\r\nbirds, many of which are posturing on the sand is a modification of the\r\nnuptial song or rather a partial reproduction of it, I do not know, but\r\nI am inclined to think it is. Many of these musicians appear on close\r\nscrutiny to be young birds, which would explain the imperfection of the\r\nsong. The posturing is often in the nature of mock fighting--I have\r\nnever seen any real blows exchanged--when two, facing each other, crouch\r\nalmost flat on the sand, and then suddenly spring at each other with\r\nwings outspread. Again, two would slowly walk toward each other with\r\nneck and body almost touching the ground and with head up. This act is\r\noften performed with tail cocked up over the back, displaying a white\r\ntriangle of tail coverts, and every now and then the birds would run at\r\neach other with outspread wings. All birds acting thus appeared to be\r\nuttering a series of rolling notes, which, emitted from a number of\r\nbirds scattered over the flats, produces a considerable volume of sound.\r\nI have described this partial song as a _whinny_, and have tried to\r\nreduce it to syllables--_eh, eh, eh_, or _what-er, what-er_.\r\n\r\nLucien M. Turner in his Ungava notes records two individuals that \"ran\r\nback and forth, uttering a purring twitter, holding their wings over\r\ntheir back with the head and neck depressed, while the posterior portion\r\nof the body was somewhat elevated. The throat was at times inflated and\r\nat other times every feather of the body was nearly reversed, presenting\r\na strange sight.\"\r\n\r\nHerbert W. Brandt supplies the following from observations in Alaska:\r\n\r\n     The semipalmated sandpiper flies high into the air, often almost\r\n     out of sight, and pours forth a sustained tinkling song, which\r\n     sounds like its native name uttered as a high-pitched\r\n     trill--\"la-v-la-v-la-v.\" As it sings it rapidly fans the air with\r\n     short wing beats, at the same time moving at considerable speed\r\n     continuously back and forth over a distance of 50 yards or more.\r\n     Four of the birds which I took to be males were rather noisy,\r\n     twittering, and purling, and occasionally one of them rushed at\r\n     another as if he seriously intended to wage mortal combat. The\r\n     feathers on his dainty neck stood out in an angered ruff; his wings\r\n     were half spread, showing their light markings; and when the little\r\n     warrior was just about to strike he folded his wings and elevated\r\n     his tail until it was almost vertical above his long wing tips.\r\n     There was, however, no real fight, for each one seemed to know his\r\n     superior and gave way, after a little display, like a weaker\r\n     rooster in a well-regulated barnyard.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--H. W. Brandt contributes the following:\r\n\r\n     The semipalmated sandpiper nests amid the short herbage on the\r\n     grassy dunes near the moaning breakers of Point Dall, where it\r\n     selects a site quite exposed to view. Among the creeping berry\r\n     vines the bird simply scratches a depression in the sand, and this\r\n     it lines with a few disconnected grass stems, stiff moss stems, and\r\n     a handful of tiny, crisp-dried leaves of the cranberry, willow, or\r\n     dwarf birch. The range of measurements of five nests is: Inside\r\n     diameter, 2 to 2-1/2 inches; inside depth, 1-1/2 to 2 inches; total\r\n     depth, 2-1/2 to 3-1/4 inches. The nest is very fragile and breaks\r\n     up at once if disturbed. Like all shore birds that nest in the\r\n     open, the brooding bird is anything but a close sitter, and in\r\n     consequence the nest must be found by diligent search. An\r\n     incubating female was collected as it departed from the nest.\r\n\r\nRoderick Macfarlane, who found many nests of this species in the Barren\r\nGrounds, describes two of them as follows:\r\n\r\n     Nest was found between two small lakes--a few withered grasses and\r\n     leaves in a shallow hole or depression, partly shaded from view by\r\n     a tuft of grass. The nest was a mere depression in the midst of\r\n     some hay and lined therewith, as well as with a few withered\r\n     leaves.\r\n\r\nWinthrop Sprague Brooks (1915) relates his experience in Alaska as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Thirteen nests were found, the first, a set of three fresh eggs,\r\n     being taken on June 12. All the nests were essentially alike--mere\r\n     cavities in damp tundra close to a pool, and lined with dry willow\r\n     leaves. On seven nests the female was found, and the male on six.\r\n     Although the male seems to take about an equal share in brooding on\r\n     the eggs and taking care of the young, I could not see that he did\r\n     this at any particular time, for I could find either sex on the\r\n     nest at midnight or midday. Neither sex showed any more concern\r\n     than the other when an intruder was at the nest. In most cases the\r\n     bird disturbed would flutter along a few yards and then remain\r\n     walking quietly and watching. On one occasion a female made a great\r\n     disturbance. Semipalmated sandpipers on the breeding ground are the\r\n     most gentle and interesting birds of the North.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--[_Author's note_: Four eggs seems to be the invariable rule\r\nwith the semipalmated sandpiper. They are usually ovate pyriform in\r\nshape with a tendency to become subpyriform. The shell is somewhat\r\nglossy. The eggs can not with certainty be distinguished from those of\r\nthe least sandpiper on one hand or the western sandpiper on the other\r\nhand; the measurements overlap with both and the colors and markings\r\nintergrade with both. I have 11 sets of semipalmated, and I can match\r\nnearly every one of them with sets from my series of the other two\r\nspecies. In series, however, they much more closely resemble the least\r\nsandpiper.\r\n\r\nHerbert W. Brandt has sent me a description of his sets taken in Alaska,\r\nwhich are probably of the normal type, as follows:\r\n\r\n     In the six sets before me the ground color is uniformly dull white\r\n     and is conspicuous. The markings are bold and individual, with most\r\n     of them round instead of elongate, although there is a slight\r\n     spiral tendency. These spots are dark, ranging from \"claret brown\"\r\n     to \"burnt lake,\" producing a deep red effect when examined in\r\n     series. The underlying spots are numerous and rather conspicuous,\r\n     due to the whitish ground color. They shade from \"light Quaker\r\n     drab\" to \"Quaker drab.\"\r\n\r\nLess than half of my sets, all from Alaska, would fit his description;\r\nthe ground colors in most of mine vary from \"pale olive buff\" to \"olive\r\nbuff\"; in some it is \"deep olive buff,\" and in one \"Isabella color.\" The\r\ncolors of the markings run from \"liver brown\" to \"chestnut brown\" in the\r\ndarkest and from \"hazel\" to \"cinnamon brown\" in the lightest. There are\r\ncomparatively few underlying drab markings. The eggs show the same\r\nvariations in shape and arrangement of markings as eggs of the least\r\nsandpiper. I have two sets from Point Barrow, taken with the parent\r\nbird, which are almost exactly like eggs of the western sandpiper in\r\ncolor and style of markings but smaller, and several other sets\r\napproaching them in appearance. There are 10 sets of eggs in the Museum\r\nof Comparative Zoology in Cambridge collected by W. Sprague Brooks near\r\nDemarcation Point, Alaska, with the parent bird in each case. Three of\r\nthese are of the western sandpiper type, and three others are similarly\r\nmarked with different shades of brown. The measurements of 52 eggs\r\naverage 30.2 by 21.2 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes\r\nmeasure =32= by 21, 30 by =22=, =27.7= by 21.3, and 31.5 by =20=\r\nmillimeters.]\r\n\r\n_Young._--According to Mr. Dixon (1917_a_), incubation lasts 17 days. It\r\nis performed equally by the male and female, as is shown by Mr. Brooks's\r\nvery conclusive report quoted above. Mr. Dixon (1917_a_), writing of\r\nbirds observed in Alaska says the young so exactly match the\r\nsurroundings that they are invisible at 3 feet. He relates the case of a\r\nsnowy owl that sailed from its perch in the direction of a brood of\r\nyoung which flattened and froze obedient to the alarm cry of the mother.\r\nThe owl poised directly over them, but evidently failed to see them and\r\nflew away. On another occasion two parasitic jaegers flew by; the young\r\nflattened, and all escaped but one that began to move before the second\r\njaeger had passed and was promptly snapped up.\r\n\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n     It was found that the parents made no effort to feed the young. It\r\n     was soon seen, however, that such care was not necessary. The young\r\n     would stumble about and pick up minute gnats and flies with great\r\n     dexterity, and the shallow algae-rimmed pools furnished them many a\r\n     juicy \"wriggler.\" The gait of the young sandpipers was a stumbling\r\n     toddle, while their large feet and legs were all out of proportion\r\n     to the rest of their slender bodies. By dropping and extending\r\n     their wings they were able to use them as crutches, which often\r\n     kept them from falling.\r\n\r\nIn about a month they were fully fledged, and a week later the\r\nsandpipers were leaving for the south.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--[_Author's note_: In natal down the young semipalmated most\r\nclosely resembles the young western sandpiper, but it is generally\r\npaler, with less brown or rufous. The forehead, sides of the head, and\r\nall under parts are white, faintly washed on the cheeks and upper breast\r\nwith pale buff; a median stripe on the forehead, reaching only halfway\r\nto the bill, a broad loral stripe, and a malar spot are black; there is\r\na black spot in the center of the crown, broken by a few very small\r\nwhite dots, surrounded by \"hazel\" and bordered with black; a short\r\nstripe over the eye and an auricular patch are black and \"hazel\" mixed;\r\nbetween these and the crown patch there is a broad band of white dots,\r\nterminal tufts; the back, rump, wings, and thighs are variegated \"hazel\"\r\nand black, with numerous small white dots, terminal tufts. The bill is\r\nbroad at the tip.\r\n\r\nYoung birds are in juvenal plumage when they reach the United States on\r\nthe fall migration. They can be distinguished from adults by the buffy\r\nedgings above and by the absence of dusky streaks on the throat and\r\nupper breast. The feathers of the crown are edged with sandy buff and\r\nthose of the back and scapulars with \"ochraceous buff\" or creamy white;\r\nthe wing coverts are edged with pale buff; the upper breast is washed\r\nwith buff and the rest of the under parts are white. This plumage is\r\npartially molted during September and October, producing a first winter\r\nplumage, which is like the adult winter plumage, except for the juvenal\r\nwing coverts, some scapulars, and a few body feathers, which are\r\nretained. At the first prenuptial molt, the next spring, young birds\r\nbecome practically adult.\r\n\r\nAdults have a complete molt from July to November, the body plumage\r\nbeing molted first and the wings last, the latter sometimes not until\r\nwinter. Their partial prenuptial molt involves the body plumage,\r\nsometimes the tail and some wing coverts; it begins in February and\r\nlasts into May. The freshly molted spring plumage, in early May, has a\r\n\"drab-gray\" appearance, due to broad drab-gray tips on the feathers of\r\nthe mantle; these tips soon wear away, revealing the bright colors of\r\nthe nuptial plumage before the end of May.]\r\n\r\n_Food._--I have recorded the following found by me in the stomachs of\r\nthis species taken on the New England coast; insects of various kinds,\r\nincluding beetles, small mollusks (_Littorina_), worms and crustaceans\r\n(_Gammarus orchestia_), bits of seaweed and sand. Dr. Alexander Wetmore\r\n(1916) records the contents of six stomachs from birds taken in Porto\r\nRico in August; 99.16 per cent was animal matter, 0.84 per cent\r\nvegetable matter.\r\n\r\n     Beetles, bugs, fly pupae, and small mollusks form the bulk of the\r\n     food. Small water scavenger beetles (_Hydrophilidae_) were found in\r\n     four stomachs and amount to 27 per cent. Two ground beetles\r\n     (_Bembidium_ sp.) amount to 5 per cent and miscellaneous beetles to\r\n     3.34 per cent. One bird had eaten nothing but four back swimmers\r\n     (_Notonecta_ sp.), and these made 16.66 per cent. Fly pupae figure\r\n     largely in two stomachs, forming 21.66 per cent of the total, and\r\n     snails (_Planorbis_ sp.) 13 per cent, while miscellaneous animal\r\n     matter amounts to 12.50 per cent. The small quantity of vegetable\r\n     matter present was rubbish. The numbers of Diptera eaten speak well\r\n     for this sandpiper.\r\n\r\nPreble and McAtee (1923) found in the stomach of a bird shot in the\r\nPribilof Islands \"remains of the beach beetle (_Aegialites\r\ncalifornicus_), 10 per cent; fragments of small flies (Diptera), 85 per\r\ncent; and two seeds (not identified), 5 per cent.\"\r\n\r\nArthur H. Howell (1924) says, \"Two stomachs of these birds from Alabama\r\ncontained the remains of small mollusks, fly larvae and beetles. This\r\nspecies is known to feed on marine worms and mosquitoes.\"\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Semipalmated sandpipers are fascinating birds to watch.\r\nWhen feeding on the beaches, they run along in a scattered flock just\r\nabove the wave line, retreating rapidly as the wave advances, but\r\nsometimes being forced to flutter above it, all the time eagerly seeking\r\nfor choice morsels. With head down, not held up as is the case with its\r\ncompanions the semipalmated plovers, it runs along dabbling here and\r\nthere irregularly, and occasionally probing with its bill in the sand.\r\nThese probings are not so deep nor so systematic as those of the\r\nsanderling, which makes a series of six to a dozen holes in succession\r\nthrowing up the sand on either side. In its greediness the semipalmated\r\nsandpiper sometimes attempts to swallow too large a morsel for its small\r\nround mouth, which is much out of proportion to the stretch of the end\r\nof the bill, and many shakings of the head are needed to get a large\r\nmorsel past the sticking point. I have seen one try several times to\r\nswallow a large beach flea (_Talorchestia megalophthalma_), and then fly\r\noff with it in its bill.\r\n\r\nOn a rocky shore I have seen them hunting for insects at high tide on\r\nthe smooth rocks, and at low tide, running among the rocks covered with\r\nseaweed (_Fucus vesiculsus_) and on the floating weed, fluttering their\r\nwings from time to time to keep from sinking. Here they find plenty of\r\nfood in the small mollusks and crustaceans, _Littorina_ and _Gammarus_.\r\nOn an August day on the coast of Maine I saw one searching about on\r\nfloating rockweed several miles from land. Shore birds doubtless often\r\nrest in this way in their long journeys over sea.\r\n\r\nIn flight, semipalmated sandpipers in flocks, large and small, often\r\nmove as one bird, twisting and turning with military precision,\r\nalternately displaying their light breasts and darker backs--flashing\r\nwhite and then almost disappearing. The method which enables shore\r\nbirds, or, indeed, any flocking bird, to accomplish these evolutions is\r\nobscure. In the case of the semipalmated sandpiper these evolutions\r\nappear often to be made in silence, although it is of course possible\r\nthat signals, not audible to the human observer, may be given. It has\r\nbeen suggested that telepathy or even that \"a common soul\" dominating\r\nthe flock may be the interpretation, but both of these explanations are\r\nat present, at least, outside of scientific ken. I have noticed that\r\nbirds who do not habitually execute evolutions, like English sparrows\r\nand the young of those that are skillful in this direction when adult,\r\nas for example, starlings, are much less proficient at this, and it\r\nseems to me possible that the whole thing may be accounted for by\r\nquickness of observation and of reaction, inherited and acquired.\r\n\r\nSemipalmated sandpipers like other shore birds often stand on one leg\r\nand even hop along on it in feeding and they also sleep in this\r\nattitude. It is difficult to distinguish these from cripples, and one is\r\neasily deceived; the cripples seem as happy and tireless in feeding as\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nWilliam Brewster (1925) thus charmingly describes the habits of this\r\nbird in the wet and soft ground at Lake Umbagog:\r\n\r\n     Here they trot to and fro, almost as actively and ceaselessly as so\r\n     many ants, picking up the inconspicuous worms or larvae from the\r\n     surface of the ground and seeking them beneath it by thrusting down\r\n     their sensitive bills quite to the nostrils, after the manner of\r\n     boring snipe, but less quickly, vigorously, and persistently. They\r\n     are also given to wading out into shallow water where they pull up\r\n     good sized masses of aquatic plants, such as _Utricularia_. By\r\n     shaking and piercing these with their bills they evidently obtain\r\n     from them food of some kind, perhaps insect larvae or small\r\n     _Crustacea_.\r\n\r\nAt high tide on the beaches, when the wet sand with its bountiful food\r\nsupply is covered, great flocks of this species, together with the least\r\nsandpiper, the sanderling, and the semipalmated plover, often spend an\r\nhour or more huddled together on the dry sand. Each species keeps more\r\nor less separate. The birds generally face the wind, but sometimes they\r\narrange themselves in the lee of bits of driftwood or other\r\nobstructions, and \"tail out\" down wind in long streamers as it were,\r\neach sheltered by the one next to windward. They sleep standing on one\r\nor both legs with the bill tucked under the feathers of the back--not\r\n\"under the wing\" as in poems--or they squat down, resting their breasts\r\non the sand. They occasionally seem to yawn by stretching one wing over\r\na leg. They also spread both wings above the back as do many other shore\r\nbirds, and they flirt the bill nervously from side to side, to relieve\r\ntheir ennui, perhaps shaking the head at the same time.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The varied courtship songs and notes have been described\r\nabove. Their call note, to my ears, is very much like that of the least\r\nsandpiper, but shriller and less melodious. A harsh rasping note and a\r\npeeping sound are also given and a low, rolling gossipy note is often\r\nemitted when they approach other birds or decoys, a note that used to be\r\nimitated with deadly effect by gunners. John T. Nichols (1920) says:\r\n\r\n     The flight note of the semipalmated sandpiper is a rather loud\r\n     \"cherk,\" softer and less reedy than the analogous krieker \"kerr.\"\r\n     It is commonly modified to a softer \"cher\" or \"che,\" which with\r\n     much variation becomes the conversational twittering of members of\r\n     a feeding flock. Soft short, snappy \"chips\" are characteristic of\r\n     flocks maneuvering about decoys * * * Hurried cheeping notes\r\n     (\"ki-i-ip\") on being flushed, are suggestive of the same note of\r\n     the krieker.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--These have been discussed at length under least\r\nsandpiper to which the reader is referred, but may be summed up here as\r\nfollows: a little larger than the least sandpiper, grayer, bill stouter\r\nand straight, tarsi and feet black, semipalmated. The young can be\r\ndistinguished from the old in the field by their nearly white breasts\r\nwashed with a smoky tint. In the hand their tarsi are seen to be black\r\nwith a slight greenish hue.\r\n\r\n_Game._--The fact that so many of these birds could be easily killed at\r\none shot, and the fact that they were so fat and palatable broiled or\r\ncooked in a pie, made them always much sought after by the pot hunter.\r\nAs large shore birds grew scarcer and it became more and more difficult\r\nfor the gunner to fill his bag with them, \"peep\" shooting, even by\r\nsportsmen, was in vogue. The Federal law has now wisely removed this\r\nspecies from the list of game birds and prevented its extinction. The\r\nbird has responded to this protection in a marked degree, and flocks of\r\n500 or more are common and pleasing sights on our beaches where\r\none-tenth of this number was once rare.\r\n\r\nThe shooting of semipalmated sandpipers occurred largely on the beaches.\r\nThe gunner dug a hole in the sand, banked it up, and put brush and\r\ndriftwood, often reinforced with seaweed, on the ramparts. At a\r\nconvenient distance decoys of wood or tin were placed, arranged like a\r\nflock of birds with their heads pointing to the wind. Occasionally large\r\nclamshells were stuck in the sand, simulating very well a flock of peep.\r\nMuch depended on the skill of the gunner in calling down the birds as\r\nthey flew along, by cunningly imitating their notes and by his care in\r\nkeeping concealed and motionless until the moment that he delivered his\r\nfire. To bring down a score of birds from a closely packed flock\r\nrequired but little skill, where, to pick off a single peep, flying\r\nerratically and swiftly by, called for well-seasoned judgment; but the\r\nchances for these birds were small indeed when the beaches were lined\r\nwith inviting decoys and concealed whistling gunners.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--On the New England coast the semipalmated sandpiper is a little\r\nlater in migration than its colleague, the least sandpiper. July 10 to\r\nOctober 30 are the usual dates, but few are seen after September 20. The\r\nadults come first, but after the middle of August the young appear, to\r\nbe distinguished by their nearly white breasts washed with a smoky tint,\r\nand by their more unsuspecting ways.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary abundance of this species at certain times on\r\nmigration is well illustrated by what Stuart T. Danforth (1925) says of\r\nit in Porto Rico. He writes:\r\n\r\n     The semipalmated sandpiper is by far the most abundant shore bird\r\n     at Cartagena Lagoon, though it occurs only as a fall migrant. I\r\n     have records from August 13 to October 20, 1924. During the latter\r\n     part of August they are present in almost unbelievable numbers. I\r\n     hardly dare estimate their numbers, but on August 26, when they\r\n     were at the height of their abundance, I am sure that 100,000 would\r\n     have been a low estimate of their numbers. They simply swarmed over\r\n     the mud flats. On this date, although I was trying to avoid\r\n     shooting them, I got 16 while shooting other birds. They were so\r\n     abundant that stray shots could not help killing numbers of them.\r\n     On other days many were also unintentionally shot in the same\r\n     manner. In fact, all but 4 of the 36 that I collected were shot in\r\n     this way. This species prefers the mud flats, but when they were so\r\n     excessively abundant some were forced to feed in the sedge and\r\n     grass associations, and when the fall rains came a little later\r\n     practically all of them were forced to the sedges and grasses and\r\n     even to the cane fields. But within a few days after this most of\r\n     them left for parts unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North America, South America, the West Indies, and\r\nnortheastern Siberia; accidental in Europe.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The semipalmated sandpiper breeds north to the\r\nnortheastern coast of Siberia (Plover Bay); Alaska (Point Hope, Point\r\nBarrow, Barter Island, Camden Bay, and Demarcation Point); Yukon\r\n(probably Herschel Island); Mackenzie (Franklin Bay), Victoria Land;\r\nnorthern Keewatin (Cape Fullerton); Labrador (Okak); and Newfoundland.\r\nEast to Labrador (Okak).

It occupies a very restricted breeding range in the coastal\r\nregions of northwestern Alaska, but is spread out over a wide winter\r\nrange, entirely across the continent in southern North America, in\r\nCentral America, and in northern South America. But we know very little\r\nabout its migration routes between these two seasonal ranges. I have\r\nnot a single spring record for it from any of my correspondents in the\r\ninterior. Undoubtedly it has been generally overlooked on account of its\r\nclose resemblance to the semipalmated sandpiper, an abundant species\r\nwhich few collectors bother to shoot. Its northward migration along the\r\nPacific coast, in April and May, is well known; this flight is mainly\r\ncoastwise and the birds are often extremely abundant. D. E. Brown, in\r\nsome notes sent to me from Westport, Washington, refers to this species\r\nas easily outnumbering all other shorebirds combined; they were\r\nassociated with redbacks, but outnumbered them 10 to 1. Dr. E. W. Nelson\r\n(1887) says of the arrival of these birds in Alaska:\r\n\r\n     As the snow disappears on the low ground about Norton Sound; from\r\n     the 10th to the 15th of May each year, and the ponds, still\r\n     ice-covered, are bordered by a ring of water, these gentle birds\r\n     arrive on the shore of Bering Sea, in the vicinity of Saint Michael\r\n     and the Yukon mouth. The advancing season finds their numbers\r\n     continually augmented until, toward the end of May, they are\r\n     extremely common and are found scattered everywhere over the mossy\r\n     flats and low hillsides. Their gentle character and trusting ways\r\n     render them very attractive to the frequenter of their territory at\r\n     this season.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--The same gifted writer describes the courtship of this\r\ngentle little sandpiper as follows:\r\n\r\n     The warm days toward the end of May cause the brown slopes and\r\n     flats to assume a shade of green, and among the pretty bird\r\n     romances going on under our eyes none is more charming than the\r\n     courtship of this delicate sandpiper. They have forsaken the\r\n     borders of icy pools, and, in twos and threes, are found scattered\r\n     over the tundra, showing a preference for small dry knolls and the\r\n     drier tussock-covered parts of the country in the vicinity of damp\r\n     spots and small ponds. Here the gentle birds may be seen at all\r\n     times tripping daintily over the moss or in and out among the tufts\r\n     of grass, conversing with each other in low, pleasant, twittering\r\n     notes, and never showing any sign of the wrangling so frequent with\r\n     their kind at this season. The female modestly avoids the male as\r\n     he pays his homage, running back and forth before her as though\r\n     anxious to exhibit his tiny form to the best advantage. At times\r\n     his heart beats high with pride and he trails his wings, elevates\r\n     and partly spreads his tail, and struts in front of his lady fair\r\n     in all the pompous vanity of a pigmy turkey-cock; or his blood\r\n     courses in a fiery stream until, filled with ecstatic joy, the\r\n     sanguine lover springs from the earth, and, rising upon vibrating\r\n     wings, some 10 or 15 yards, he poises, hovering in the same\r\n     position, sometimes nearly a minute, while he pours forth a rapid,\r\n     uniform series of rather musical trills, which vary in strength as\r\n     they gradually rise and fall, producing pleasant cadences. The\r\n     wings of the songster meanwhile vibrate with such rapid motion that\r\n     they appear to keep time with the rapidly trilling notes, which can\r\n     only be likened to the running down of a small spring and may be\r\n     represented by the syllables _tzr-r-e-e-e, zr-e-e-e-, zr-e-e-e_, in\r\n     a fine high-pitched tone, with an impetus at each \"=Z=.\" This part\r\n     of the song ended, the bird raises its wings above its back, thus\r\n     forming a =V=, and glides slowly to the ground, uttering at the\r\n     same time, in a trill, but with a deeper and richer tone, a series\r\n     of notes which may be likened to the syllables _tzur-r-r-r,\r\n     tzur-r-r-r_. The word \"throaty\" may be applied to these latter\r\n     notes as distinguished from the high-pitched key of the first part\r\n     of the song.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Herbert W. Brandt, who has had extensive experience with the\r\nnesting habits of this species, says in his manuscript notes:\r\n\r\n     The gentle little western sandpiper is the most abundant and most\r\n     widely distributed shore bird occurring in the Hooper Bay region.\r\n     Throughout the area, wherever dry ground is found, it is plentiful,\r\n     and it even occurs on the lower mountain slopes of the Askinuk\r\n     Range. Before the tundra had discarded its snowy mantle the first\r\n     birds of this species had responded to the lure of early spring,\r\n     for they arrived on May 14, and two days later they were common,\r\n     while on May 20 they were abundant, carrying on everywhere their\r\n     dainty aerial butterfly courtship. The western sandpiper is usually\r\n     found in large scattering colonies especially on the upland tundra\r\n     where for large areas they average one or two pairs to the acre.\r\n     Isolated couples, however, are occasionally encountered.\r\n\r\n     The nest of the western sandpiper is well concealed from view by\r\n     the surrounding curly bunch-grass that everywhere in the dryer\r\n     areas forces its way up amid the moss. Under this protection a\r\n     depression is made and scantily lined with grass, and usually in\r\n     addition with considerable tiny leaves of the prostrate\r\n     berry-bearing vines, of the dwarf birch, and of the reindeer moss\r\n     stems. In consequence, the nest is very fragile and loosely made,\r\n     but before it is disturbed it is neatly cup-shaped. The range of\r\n     measurements of 32 nests is: Inside diameter, 2 to 3 inches; depth\r\n     of cavity, 1-1/2 to 3 inches; and total depth, 2-1/2 to 4 inches.\r\n     Both male and female share in the tender duties of incubation and\r\n     are often very loath to forsake their nest, so that when crossing\r\n     their chosen haunts an incubating bird, by fluttering up before\r\n     one's very feet, will occasionally unwittingly betray its\r\n     well-concealed abode.\r\n\r\n     These charming little creatures are most brave, even eager in\r\n     defense of their homes, often charging with puffed-out feathers\r\n     and head drawn against the body to make themselves look as\r\n     formidable as possible. Their tameness and familiarity are\r\n     remarkable. Often after we had removed the eggs the parent would\r\n     go to the empty nest, sit on it for a little while, then come out,\r\n     her little body a-purr with agitation, and inquire in her thin\r\n     incessant voice what had become of the eggs. It is little wonder\r\n     that I shot very few specimens for identification purposes. This\r\n     tiny sandpiper had won too deep a place in my affections.\r\n\r\nThe confiding nature of these birds is referred to by other writers.\r\nDoctor Nelson (1887) tells how one of his men lay on the ground with his\r\noutstretched hand close beside a nest; but the bird soon returned,\r\ncrossed his arm and settled on the nest, where she was caught with turn\r\nof his hand and released. Alfred M. Bailey (1926) placed his \"hat over\r\none set of eggs, leaving just room for the parent bird to crawl under,\r\nwhich she immediately proceeded to do.\"\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Herbert W. Brandt has given me the following good description\r\nof his 120 eggs of this species, collected by him at Hooper Bay,\r\nAlaska:\r\n\r\n     Four eggs always constitute a complete set with the western\r\n     sandpiper, but occasionally late nests with three eggs in each were\r\n     observed, which were probably second layings. They are pyriform to\r\n     subpyriform in shape and are placed in the nest with the small ends\r\n     together and pointed downward, snuggling amid the loose interior\r\n     contents of the nest. The shell is smooth, has a slight luster, and\r\n     is strongly constructed. The markings on the same set of eggs\r\n     always follow the same type in color, and likewise the ground color\r\n     is always the same shade. In the series of eggs the prevalent\r\n     ground color is \"cream color,\" but the shades vary from dull white,\r\n     which is very rare, to equally rare \"wood brown.\" The ground color\r\n     is often almost obliterated by the profuseness of the markings,\r\n     especially on the larger two-thirds of the egg. The color of the\r\n     surface markings is usually \"Kaiser brown,\" but they show\r\n     considerable variation, dependent upon the amount of pigment\r\n     deposited, ranging from \"brick red\" to \"chestnut brown.\" The spots\r\n     are somewhat elongated and vary from small pin points to large\r\n     blotches that may completely cover the larger end of the egg. These\r\n     have a decided tendency to spiral from left to right. The\r\n     underlying markings are inconspicuous and are only visible on eggs\r\n     having a pale background and then they are of small size and\r\n     indistinct. The eggs are generally flecked with additional markings\r\n     consisting of a few intense irregular spots or fine lines of slate\r\n     black to black. These blackbird-like markings are almost always on\r\n     the larger end, although on many eggs they are entirely wanting. In\r\n     series the eggs of the western sandpiper have a decidedly bright\r\n     red appearance, and are thus distinct from any eggs occurring in\r\n     the Hooper Bay region.\r\n\r\nThe western sandpiper has been known to lay five eggs.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of 120 eggs, furnished by Mr. Brandt, average 30.8 by\r\n21.9 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =32.5= by\r\n22.3, 32 by =22.8=, =28.7= by 21.6, and 30.3 by =21.1= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--H. B. Conover tells me that both sexes incubate, at least both\r\nhad incubation patches. He says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     On June 15 the first newly hatched young were found. The parents\r\n     were very solicitous and flew about twittering anxiously. Soon\r\n     other old birds joined them and seemed just as anxious as if the\r\n     young were their own. This habit of these sandpipers in joining\r\n     forces to help their neighbors was very noticeable both before and\r\n     after the eggs had hatched. By June 30 half-grown young that could\r\n     already fly for a few yards were being seen. Western sandpipers\r\n     with their chicks were everywhere, and during a walk around the\r\n     tundra you had a constant attendance of anxious mothers and fathers\r\n     wheeling about. Eggs were still being found on July 5. By July 18\r\n     the mud flats were covered with fully fledged young of this\r\n     species.\r\n\r\n     The incubation period for this species seems to be about 21 days.\r\n     A nest found on May 26 with four eggs hatched on June 15 late in\r\n     the evening. Another found on May 29 with three eggs in it, had\r\n     four eggs on May 30, and three young and a pipped egg on the\r\n     evening of June 19. The rapidity with which these birds lay and\r\n     hatch their eggs and raise their young is very remarkable. In 60\r\n     days from their arrival on the nesting grounds the young are full\r\n     grown and taking care of themselves.\r\n\r\nMr. Brandt in his manuscript says:\r\n\r\n     It seemed to us as if every western sandpiper about Hooper Bay must\r\n     have deposited its first egg on practically the same day, because\r\n     the four days following May 26 more than 50 nests were recorded,\r\n     and after June 15 the beautiful brown and black mottled young all\r\n     of the same size were to be found everywhere. These newly born bird\r\n     mites are not long abed, however, for in one case an hour after\r\n     hatching their cradle was empty.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy young western sandpiper, when first hatched, is\r\nrichly colored in warm, bright browns and buffs, quite different in\r\nappearance from the young semipalmated sandpiper. Behind a broad\r\n\"cinnamon buff\" forehead is a large, rounded crown patch extending from\r\nabove the eyes to the nape, in which the down is basally black, but\r\ndeeply tipped \"burnt sienna\"; in the center of this a cluster of buffy\r\ndown tips produces a spot, which is divided by a blackish median stripe\r\nextending down to the bill; a band of pale buff, produced by down tips,\r\nencircles the sides and rear of the crown patch; there is a loral stripe\r\nand a short malar stripe of black; the sides of the head and neck are\r\n\"cinnamon buff\"; and a variable pattern of \"burnt sienna\" decorates the\r\nauricular region, behind and above the eye. The remainder of the upper\r\nparts, back, wings, rump, and thighs are a mixture of black and dark,\r\nrich browns, \"bay,\" \"burnt sienna,\" and \"amber brown,\" sprinkled, in an\r\nirregular pattern, in the darker portions with tiny buff tips. The under\r\nparts vary from pale buff on the breast to buffy white on the throat and\r\nto white on the belly. The bright colors fade to dull browns and grayish\r\nas the chick grows older. The first of the juvenal plumage appears on\r\nthe scapulars and then on the sides of the breast.\r\n\r\nIn fresh juvenal plumage, as seen in Alaska in June, the crown is\r\n\"sepia\" with \"pinkish cinnamon\" edgings; the nape is \"drab-gray,\"\r\nstreaked with dusky; the feathers of the mantle are brownish black,\r\nedged with \"tawny\" on the back and broadly edged with \"tawny\" and white\r\non the scapulars; the rump, upper tail coverts, and central tail\r\nfeathers are \"sepia\"; the other rectrices are \"light mouse gray\"; the\r\nwing coverts are \"mouse gray,\" tipped with \"tawny\" or lighter buff; the\r\nthroat and under parts are white, washed on the breast with \"light\r\ncinnamon-drab,\" and streaked on the sides of the breast with dusky. This\r\nplumage fades somewhat during migration and the body plumage is mostly\r\nall molted before October. In their first winter plumage young birds can\r\nbe distinguished from adults only by the wing coverts and a few retained\r\nscapulars and tertials. At the first prenuptial molt they become\r\npractically adult.\r\n\r\nAdults have a complete postnuptial molt in the summer and fall, molting\r\nthe body plumage in July and August and the wings and tail in November\r\nor later. The prenuptial molt in March and April involves only the body\r\nplumage. The fresh plumage, in April, is veiled with \"drab-gray\" tips,\r\nwhich soon wear away, revealing the bright nuptial colors.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Very little has been published on the food of the western\r\nsandpiper, but it probably feeds on the same things as the other small\r\nsandpipers with which it associates. Arthur H. Howell (1924) says:\r\n\r\n     Six stomachs of this bird collected in Alabama showed its food to\r\n     be minute fly larvae, aquatic beetles and bugs, marine worms, and\r\n     small snails.\r\n\r\nStuart T. Danforth (1925) found 150 bloodworms and a Hydrophilid larva\r\nin the stomach of one taken in Porto Rico.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--S. F. Rathbun has sent me the following notes on the habits\r\nof the western sandpiper on the coast of Washington:\r\n\r\n     This is one of the small sandpipers of this region that will be\r\n     found common at the time of the migration periods along the ocean\r\n     beaches and on the tide flats. It occurs in flocks of varying\r\n     sizes, some of which contain an exceedingly large number of birds.\r\n     At times if care is used one can approach a flock quite closely,\r\n     often within 15 or 20 feet, and it is of interest to watch the\r\n     actions of the individuals. They are active birds, being constantly\r\n     on the move as they feed, and while thus engaged keep up a\r\n     continual conversation, as it were, this being of the nature of a\r\n     soft, rolling whistle which is pleasant to hear. These sandpipers\r\n     seem to prefer to feed at or near the waters edge, particularly\r\n     where there is an ebb and flow, being very active in following up\r\n     the water as it recedes and equally so in avoiding its incoming,\r\n     but always at the very edge as it were. They secure their food by a\r\n     skimming like movement of the bill over the surface of the mud that\r\n     has just been covered by the water, and as the birds advance or\r\n     retreat in following the flow it is quite amusing to observe the\r\n     seeming pains taken to avoid coming into contact with it. And still\r\n     at times individuals may be seen in some of the very shallow spots.\r\n     It is a fine sight to see a flock of these sandpipers suddenly take\r\n     alarm as they are feeding; all quickly spring into the air as if\r\n     moved by the same impulse at exactly the same moment, and then form\r\n     a compact body that will execute a variety of evolutions in perfect\r\n     harmony. The flock will rise and fall and wheel and turn, and at\r\n     times may split into several smaller ones, these to again reunite,\r\n     and should one happen to stand where the light falls directly on\r\n     the birds the white of their underparts as they turn is very\r\n     striking. These actions may be repeated a number of times, and then\r\n     without warning the flock of birds will alight and quickly scatter\r\n     in search of food. Scenes like this are what give an enlightenment\r\n     to the waste places and fortunately, under the protection now\r\n     afforded the species, are likely to continue to be enacted in the\r\n     future. But large as the numbers of the western sandpiper still\r\n     appear to be, they are not comparable to those of fifteen or twenty\r\n     years ago, and the cause of this decrease in their numbers is the\r\n     same old story. It seems hardly possible that a bird so small could\r\n     have been regarded as game and its hunting come under the name of\r\n     sport, but such was the case and it brought about the logical\r\n     result. One may be thankful, however, that this no longer can be\r\n     done, and hope that the lapse of time may bring about somewhat of\r\n     an increase in the number of these birds.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--John T. Nichols contributes the following on the calls of this\r\nspecies:\r\n\r\n     The most common loud call of the western sandpiper has the _ee_\r\n     sound found in the _kreep_ of the least sandpiper, a plaintive\r\n     quality as in the voice of the sanderling, and suggests somewhat\r\n     the squawk of a young robin. It is variable and may be written\r\n     _chee-rp_, _cheep_, or _chir-eep_. It seems to be the flight note\r\n     of the species, corresponding to the _cherk_ of the semipalmated\r\n     sandpiper, and is also used by a bird on the ground calling to\r\n     others in the air which alight with it, as such flight notes\r\n     sometimes are. Its closest resemblance with a note of the\r\n     semipalmated is to the _serup_ sometimes heard from that bird when\r\n     flushing.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Some of the calls of the western are apparently indistinguishable\r\n     from those of the semipalmated sandpiper, but as studied on the\r\n     northwest coast of Florida, where it greatly outnumbered the other\r\n     form, more seemed different. Birds took wing with a _sirp_, or at\r\n     another time a _chir-ir-ip_, which heard also in a medley of\r\n     variations from a flock already on the wing, suggesting the notes\r\n     of the horned lark, may be more or less analogous with the short\r\n     flocking note of the semipalmated sandpiper.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--It is most difficult and often impossible to distinguish\r\nbetween the western and the semipalmated sandpipers in life; and I have\r\nexperienced difficulty in distinguishing between them even in the hand.\r\nThe western has a longer bill, and I believe that the bill measurements\r\nof corresponding sexes do not overlap, though they approach very\r\nclosely; but the longest-billed female semipalmated may have a longer\r\nbill than the shortest-billed male western. In spring and summer\r\nplumages the western shows much more rufous in the upper parts and is\r\nmore conspicuously and more heavily streaked on the breast, but in\r\nwinter plumage the two species are very much alike. Mr. Nichols has\r\ngiven me a few characters by which this species can be recognized even\r\nin winter; he calls it \"a somewhat larger, rangier, paler, grayer bird\"\r\nthan the semipalmated; it also has \"better developed white stripes over\r\nthe eyes which meet more broadly on the forehead, the top of the head is\r\nnot so dark, its dark auricular area is not so prominent, the markings\r\non the top, and particularly on the sides, of the head and neck are\r\nfiner.\r\n\r\nAs to the bills, he says:\r\n\r\n     There is a subtle difference in their bills, however, which I have\r\n     frequently noticed in life and once or twice checked by taking\r\n     specimens. The bill of a long-billed semipalmated sandpiper is\r\n     quite straight and becomes slender toward the end; that of a\r\n     short-billed western is not so slender toward the end and with just\r\n     an appreciable downward bend before its tip. In long-billed\r\n     individuals of the western sandpiper the bill becomes slender\r\n     toward the end and frequently has a decided drop at the tip. Such\r\n     birds are unmistakably different to anyone thoroughly familiar with\r\n     the semipalmated sandpiper.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Like many other waders, these little sandpipers begin to move\r\noff their breeding grounds at a very early date. As early as June 21,\r\n1914, F. S. Hersey saw western sandpipers flocking at the mouth of the\r\nYukon River, Alaska. Some of the flocks contained from 40 to 60 birds.\r\nThe larger flocks were all of this species, but the smaller flocks often\r\ncontained one long-billed dowitcher.\r\n\r\nDoctor Nelson (1887) says, of its fall wanderings:\r\n     Early in July the young are on the wing and begin to gather in\r\n     flocks toward the 1st of August. The last of these birds are seen\r\n     on the coast of Norton Sound and the Yukon mouth the 1st of\r\n     October. Although it is not recorded from the Seal and Aleutian\r\n     Islands, I have seen the bird at St. Lawrence Island, south of\r\n     Bering Straits, and at several points along the northeastern coast\r\n     of Siberia, and it frequents the Arctic coasts of Alaska in\r\n     addition to being found throughout the interior along streams where\r\n     suitable flats occur. Murdoch notes it as a fall visitor at Point\r\n     Barrow. It has been found in abundance on the southeast coast of\r\n     the Territory, where it occurs during the migrations.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of British Columbia and farther south it is an abundant\r\nfall migrant, but it is rare or casual inland; the first arrivals\r\nsometimes reach California before the middle of July. Migration records\r\nfor the great interior are almost entirely lacking and how it reaches\r\nthe Atlantic coast, where it is so abundant in fall and winter, is a\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols wrote to me as follows:\r\n\r\n     The occurrence of this bird on the North Atlantic coast of the\r\n     United States is irregular. At times it is really numerous on Long\r\n     Island over periods of several years, and then it becomes rare\r\n     again. In the 1912 southward migration the western was carefully\r\n     looked for among the abundant semipalmated sandpiper but no\r\n     evidence of its presence was found. In 1913 a single bird with a\r\n     very white head and a peculiar note suggesting a young robin was, I\r\n     now feel confident, a western sandpiper, at the time it passed as\r\n     unidentified. The following year one of the white-headed\r\n     long-billed juvenal westerns was picked out in a flock of\r\n     semipalmated in August and collected. Later several others, all\r\n     well-marked birds were identified in flocks of the semipalmated. In\r\n     1916 and 1917 the species was still more numerous. On October 12,\r\n     1917, at Long Beach with R. C. Murphy it was estimated that about\r\n     one-half the _Ereunetes_ were this, one-half the common eastern\r\n     form. Specimens of each were obtained from gunners present. The\r\n     following year (1918) a flock on the beach in late spring (June 2)\r\n     were predominatingly western; the species returned again from the\r\n     north in early July (July 4). During this or the immediately\r\n     succeeding southward migrations the semipalmated fell off in\r\n     numbers, and furthermore, a great many birds thought to be western\r\n     were indeterminate. Mr. E. P. Bicknell met the same condition which\r\n     I found at Mastic further west at Long Beach. I remember a letter\r\n     wherein he spoke of the semipalmated being replaced by the western,\r\n     but I did not take just that view of it. For a year or two I have\r\n     no real idea how common either species was. I saw numerous birds\r\n     that seemed to be western, but mostly indeterminate, and took no\r\n     specimens. Later the standard semipalmated reestablished its\r\n     usually large numbers and this season (1925) probably for the first\r\n     time the western was again common among them, about as in 1916,\r\n     some of this latter form easily identifiable birds (in life).\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Arthur T. Wayne (1910) says:\r\n\r\n     The western sandpiper is the most abundant of all the waders that\r\n     winter on this coast. It is not unusual to see thousands of these\r\n     birds any day during the winter months. It can almost be considered\r\n     a permanent resident, as it is only absent from May 20 until July\r\n     8. The adults arrive in worn breeding plumage and immediately begin\r\n     to moult the feathers of the head and throat. By the first week in\r\n     August they have acquired their autumn plumage.\r\n\r\nAmong the big flocks of small sandpipers that we saw all winter\r\nfrequenting the extensive mud flats in the vicinity of Tampa Bay,\r\nFlorida, I am satisfied that this species was well represented, if not\r\nthe predominating species. I confess that I can not identify in life\r\nmore than a very small percentage of these little \"peep,\" and then only\r\nwhen seen under most favorable circumstances. One dislikes to shoot any\r\nnumber of the gentle little birds for identification. But what few we\r\nshot proved to be western sandpipers, and I am inclined to think that\r\nmost of them were. Mr. Nichols writes to me:\r\n\r\n     In my limited experience _mauri_ is commoner than _pusillus_ on the\r\n     west coast of Florida. In Wakulla County in March and September,\r\n     1919, most all the _Ereunetes_ were western, only one or two among\r\n     them definitely identified as _pusillus_; and in April, 1917, two\r\n     or three western were identified with least sandpipers south of\r\n     Sanibel Light.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North America, Central America, the West Indies, and northern\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--So far as known, the western sandpiper breeds only in\r\nAlaska. North to Cape Prince of Wales, Cape Blossom, Point Barrow, and\r\nCamden Bay. East to Camden Bay and St. Michael. South to St. Michael,\r\nPastolik, and Hooper Bay. West to Hooper Bay, Nome, and Cape Prince of\r\nWales. It has been taken in summer in northeastern Siberia at two\r\npoints, East Cape on July 14, 1913, and Cape Serdze, on July 16, 1913.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The Pacific, Gulf, and South Atlantic coasts of the\r\nUnited States, the West Indies, Central America, and northern South\r\nAmerica. North to Washington (Dungeness Spit, and Smith Island); Texas\r\n(Brownsville and Corpus Christi); Louisiana (Cameron and Vermilion\r\nParishes); Alabama (Dauphin Island); and rarely, North Carolina (Pea\r\nIsland). East to rarely, North Carolina (Pea Island and Fort Macon);\r\nSouth Carolina (Charleston); Georgia (Blackbeard Island); Florida\r\n(Amelia Island, and Fort Myers); Cuba (Guantanamo); and Trinidad. South\r\nto Trinidad; Venezuela (Margarita Island); probably northern Colombia\r\n(Sabanilla); probably Costa Rica (Barranca Puntarenas); Tehuantepec\r\n(Tehuantepec City); and Lower California (La Paz). West to Lower\r\nCalifornia (La Paz); California (San Diego County, Alameda, Oakland, and\r\nBerkeley); and Washington (Point Chehalis; Seattle, and Dungeness Spit).\r\nIt also has been detected in winter on San Clemente Island, off the\r\ncoast of southern California.\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--The spring movement of birds that have wintered on\r\nthe South Atlantic coast is imperfectly known, there being available no\r\ninterior records that indicate the route by which they reach the\r\nbreeding grounds. The species has been detected at Long Beach, New York,\r\nas early as April 25, and at Mastic, New York, on May 12, while late\r\nspring departures from South Carolina have been noted at Charleston on\r\nMay 8, and from Mastic, New York, on June 2.\r\n\r\nEarly dates of arrival in the West are: Arizona, Fort Verde, April 11,\r\nand San Pedro River, April 17; Colorado, Denver, May 2, and Loveland,\r\nMay 9; Nevada, Smoky Creek, May 6; Idaho, Meridian, May 6; British\r\nColumbia, Sumas, April 20, and Chilliwack, April 26; and Alaska, Kuiu\r\nIsland, April 28, Craig, May 2, Patterson's Bay, May 7, Admiralty\r\nIsland, May 8, Fort Kenai, May 12, Hooper Bay, May 14, and Prince of\r\nWales Island, May 15.\r\n\r\nLate dates of spring departure at western points are: Texas, Somerest,\r\nMay 5, San Angelo, May 6, Seadrift, May 8, and Tom Green and Concho\r\nCounties, May 12; Kansas, Lawrence, May 26; South Dakota, Vermilion, May\r\n24, and Forestburg, May 26; lower California, San Quentin Bay, May 10;\r\nCalifornia, Fresno, May 12, Santa Barbara, May 16, Los Angeles, May 19,\r\nAlameda, May 21, and Owens Lake, June 1; Oregon, Mercer, May 14;\r\nWashington, Ilwaco, May 18, Neah Bay, May 24, Clallam Bay, May 25, and\r\nQuillayute Needles, May 30.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--Early dates of arrival in the fall are: British\r\nColumbia, Courtenay, July 7, Nootka Sound, July 23, and Okanagan\r\nLanding, July 28; Washington, Cape Flattery, July 2, Destruction Island,\r\nJuly 3, and Granville, July 4; Oregon, Cow Creek Lake, July 4;\r\nCalifornia, Santa Barbara, July 3, Fresno, July 5, and Tulare Lake, July\r\n7; Lower California, San Quentin, August 24; Mexico, San Mateo, August\r\n7; Idaho, Meridian, July 23, and Big Lost River, July 25; Wyoming, Fort\r\nBridger, July 13; Oklahoma, Old Greer County, July 19; Arizona, Tucson,\r\nAugust 16, and San Bernardino Ranch, August 24; Texas, Mobeetie, July\r\n27, Beaumont, August 5, Rockport, August 12, Hereford, August 18, and\r\nPadre Island, August 21; Massachusetts, Monomoy Island, July 19, and\r\nNahant, August 4; New York, Mastic, July 4, and Freeport, July 16; South\r\nCarolina, Charleston, July 8; and Florida, James Island, July 20.\r\n\r\nLate dates of fall departure are: Alaska, Craig, September 24, and St.\r\nLazaria Island, September 29; British Columbia, Chilliwack, September\r\n11, and Comox, September 26; Montana, Great Falls, September 4; New\r\nMexico, Albuquerque, October 5; Massachusetts, North Truro, September 2,\r\nand Harvard, September 8; New York, Chateaugay, September 13,\r\nAmityville, September 17, and Long Beach, October 12; New Jersey, Cape\r\nMay County, September 14; District of Columbia, Anacostia River,\r\nSeptember 25; and Virginia, Four-mile Run, September 11.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--Casual occurrences of the western sandpiper must, of\r\ncourse, be based upon specimen evidence, as this species is easily\r\nconfused with the semipalmated sandpiper. For this reason several\r\nrecords are considered doubtful, while in other regions it may be more\r\nnumerous than is now known. One was taken August 21, 1907, at Beaver,\r\nPennsylvania, while two were collected at Burlington, Iowa, on October\r\n15, 1895, and one at Columbus, Ohio, on September 12, 1925.\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Alaska: 159 records, May 23 to July 7: 80 records, May 29\r\nto June 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROCETHIA ALBA (Pallas)\r\n\r\nSANDERLING\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nAlong the forearm of Cape Cod, from the elbow at Chatham to the wrist\r\nnear Provincetown, extend about 30 miles of nearly continuous ocean\r\nbeaches, to which we can add 10 more if we include that long, narrow\r\nstrip of beach and marsh called Monomoy. Facing the broad Atlantic and\r\nexposed to all its furious storms, these beaches are swept clean and\r\npounded to a hard surface by the ceaseless waves. Even in calm weather\r\nthe restless ocean swells and surges up and down over these sloping\r\nsands, and the winter storms may make or wash away a mile or so of beach\r\nin a single season. Here on the ocean side of the beach, the \"back side\r\nof the beach,\" as it is called on the cape, is the favorite resort of\r\nthe little sanderlings in fair weather or in foul. They are well named\r\n\"beach birds,\" for here they are seldom found anywhere except on the\r\nocean beaches, and I believe that the same is true of the Pacific coast.\r\nThey are particularly active and happy during stormy weather, for then a\r\nbountiful supply of food is cast up by the heavy surf. But at all times\r\nthe surf line attracts them, where they nimbly follow the receding waves\r\nto snatch their morsels of food or skillfully dodge the advancing line\r\nof foam as it rolls up the beach.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--To the ends of the earth and back again extend the migrations\r\nof the sanderling, the cosmopolitan globe trotter; few species, if any,\r\nequal it in world-wide wanderings. Nesting in the Arctic regions of both\r\nhemispheres, it migrates through all of the continents, and many of the\r\nislands, to the southernmost limits of south America and Africa, and\r\neven to Australia.\r\n\r\nThe spring migration starts in March, though the last migrants may hot\r\nleave their winter resorts until late in April; they have been noted in\r\nChile from April 11 to 29, and even in May. The earliest migrants have\r\nbeen known to reach New England and Ohio before the end of March. The\r\nmain flight passes through Massachusetts in May, a few birds lingering\r\ninto June. In the interior and on the Pacific coast the dates are about\r\nthe same. C. G. Harrold has taken it in Manitoba as early as April 29,\r\nbut William Rowan (1926) says that the main flight comes along during\r\nthe last week in May and the first few days of June, when it is\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nA. L. V. Manniche (1910) thus describes the arrival of the sanderling on\r\nits breeding grounds in northeastern Greenland:\r\n\r\n     The sanderling arrived at Stormkap singly or in couples\r\n     respectively June 2, 1907, and May 28, 1908. In company with the\r\n     other waders and large flocks of snow buntings, which arrived at\r\n     the same time, the sanderlings would in the first days after their\r\n     arrival resort to the few spots in the marshes and the surrounding\r\n     stony plains, which were free from snow; here they led a miserable\r\n     existence. Heavy snow storms and low temperature in connection with\r\n     want of open water made the support of life difficult to the birds.\r\n\r\n     The temperature increased quickly and caused in a few days the\r\n     places in which the birds could find food to extend very much. The\r\n     areas free from snow grew larger and larger, and the ice along the\r\n     beaches of small lakes and ponds with low water disappeared before\r\n     the scorching sun; at the same time small ponds of melting snow\r\n     were formed around in the field. Now the sanderlings would in\r\n     couples retire from the party of other birds, and lead a quiet and\r\n     tranquil life on the stony and dry plains. Now and then they would\r\n     pay a visit to ponds of melting snow and beaches of fresh water\r\n     lakes in order to bathe and seek food, and here they would join\r\n     the party of other small waders as for instance _Tringa alpina_\r\n     and _Aegialitis hiaticula_. According to my experience old birds\r\n     would never resort to salt water shore.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--The same observer tells us all we know about the courtship\r\nof the sanderling, as follows:\r\n\r\n     The pairing began toward the middle of June. The peculiar pairing\r\n     flight of the male was to be seen and heard when the weather was\r\n     fine, and especially in the evening. Uttering a snarling or slight\r\n     neighing sound, he mounts to a height of some two meters from the\r\n     surface of the ground on strongly vibrating wings, to continue at\r\n     this height his flight for a short distance, most frequently in a\r\n     straight line, but sometimes in small circles.\r\n\r\n     When excited he frequently sits on the top of a solitary large\r\n     stone, his dorsal feathers blown out, his tail spread, and his\r\n     wings half let down, producing his curious subdued pairing tones.\r\n     He, however, soon returns to the female, which always keeps mute,\r\n     and then he tries by slow, affected, almost creeping movements to\r\n     induce her to pairing, until at last the act of pairing takes\r\n     place; when effected, both birds rush away in rapid flight, to\r\n     return soon after to the nesting place. I have also observed males\r\n     in pairing flight without being able to discover any female in the\r\n     neighborhood, and then, of course, without realizing the pairing\r\n     as completing act. The male is in the pairing time very\r\n     quarrelsome, and does not permit any strange bird to intrude on\r\n     the selected domain. He seems to be most envious against birds of\r\n     his own kin.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The sanderling breeds only in the far north, so far north\r\nthat only very few Arctic explorers have found its nest. Strangely,\r\nhowever, the first recorded nest was found in a region where it rarely\r\nbreeds and considerably south of its main breeding grounds. This was the\r\nnest found by Roderick MacFarlane (1908) on the barren grounds of\r\nnorthern Canada, of which he says:\r\n\r\n     On the 29th of June, 1864, we discovered a nest of this species in\r\n     the barren grounds east of Fort Anderson. It contained four eggs,\r\n     which we afterwards learnt were the first and only authenticated\r\n     examples at that time known to American naturalists. The nest was\r\n     composed of withered grasses and leaves placed in a small cavity or\r\n     depression in the ground. The contents of the eggs were quite\r\n     fresh, and they measured 1.44 inches by 0.95 to 0.99 in breadth,\r\n     and their ground color was a brownish olive marked with faint spots\r\n     and blotches of bister. These markings were very generally\r\n     diffused, but were a little more numerous about the larger ends.\r\n     They were of an oblong pyriform shape. The parent bird was snared\r\n     on the nest. It is a very rare bird in the Anderson River country,\r\n     and we failed to find another nest thereof.\r\n\r\nThe main breeding grounds of the sanderling are probably on the more\r\nnorthern Arctic islands, but not enough nests have ever been found\r\nanywhere to produce the hosts of birds which we see on migrations. Col.\r\nH. W. Feilden (1877) gives the following description of his discovery of\r\nthe nest of this species:\r\n\r\n     I first observed this species in Grinnell Land on the 5th of June,\r\n     1876, flying in company with knots and turnstones; at this date it\r\n     was feeding, like the other waders, on the buds of _Saxifraga\r\n     oppositifolia_. This bird was by no means abundant along the coast\r\n     of Grinnell Land, but I observed several pairs in the aggregate,\r\n     and found a nest of this species containing two eggs in latitude\r\n     82° 33' N. on June 24, 1876. This nest, from which I killed the\r\n     male bird, was placed on a gravel ridge, at an altitude of several\r\n     hundred feet above the sea, and the eggs were deposited in a slight\r\n     depression in the center of a recumbent plant of Arctic willow, the\r\n     lining of the nest consisting of a few withered leaves and some of\r\n     the last year's catkins. August 8, 1876, along the shores of\r\n     Robeson Channel, I saw several parties of young ones, three to four\r\n     in number, following their parents, and led by the old birds,\r\n     searching most diligently for insects. At this date they were in a\r\n     very interesting stage of plumage, being just able to fly, but\r\n     retaining some of the down on their feathers.\r\n\r\nThe best account we have of the home life of the sanderling is given to\r\nus by Mr. Manniche (1910), who found this species to be one of the\r\ncommonest breeding birds in northeastern Greenland. He writes:\r\n\r\n     In the extensive moor and marsh stretches west of Stormkap are many\r\n     smaller stony and clayey parts lying scattered like a sort of\r\n     islands. As these \"stone isles\" are most restricted in size, I\r\n     could without special difficulty realize the existence of the birds\r\n     here, and I found several nestling sanderlings on such places. The\r\n     problem was decidedly more difficult to me when the birds had their\r\n     homes on the extensive table-lands farther inland; here it will\r\n     depend on luck to meet with a couple of nestling sanderlings.\r\n\r\n     The laying began about June 20. The first nest found containing\r\n     eggs dates from June 28; these had, however, already been brooded\r\n     for some days. The clutch of eggs latest found dates from July 15;\r\n     the eggs in this nest were very much incubated. The sanderling\r\n     places its nest on the before mentioned dry clay-mixed stony\r\n     plains sparsely covered with _Salix arctica_, _Dryas octopetala_,\r\n     _Saxifraga oppositifolia_, and a few other scattered low growths.\r\n     I only found the nest on places of this type, never on moors or\r\n     plains entirely uncovered. The larger or smaller extent, the\r\n     higher or lower position over the level of the sea and the\r\n     distance from nearest shore of such locality is, according to my\r\n     experience, of no consequence. It only seems, as if the sanderling\r\n     prefers to nest on such places, which are situated not very far\r\n     from fresh water--a lake or a pond--to the shores of which the\r\n     young ones are often directed. Some nests found prove, however,\r\n     that the birds do not insist upon this.\r\n\r\n     The situation of the nest is also extremely constant. At the\r\n     edge--or rarer farther in--of a tuft of _Dryas_, the bird will form\r\n     a cup-shaped not very deep nest hollow, the bottom of which is\r\n     sparsely lined with withered leaves of _Salix arctica_ or other\r\n     plants growing in the neighbourhood. In size, and partly in shape\r\n     the sanderling's nest resembles that of _Tringa alpina_. The\r\n     striking likeness in color to the surroundings and the monotonous\r\n     character of the landscape makes it extremely difficult to find the\r\n     nest unless the bird itself shows the way to it. The number of eggs\r\n     in a clutch is always four. I found eleven nests with eggs and some\r\n     fifty hatches of downy young ones but none of these differed from\r\n     the normal number.\r\n\r\nBy excellent tactics the breeding female understands to keep secret the\r\nhiding place of the nest. She will generally leave the nest so early and\r\nsecretly, that even the most experienced and attentive eye does not\r\nperceive it. She rushes rapidly from the nest with her head pressed down\r\nagainst her back executing some peculiar creeping movements quite mute,\r\nand hidden between stones and plants; following natural hollows in the\r\nground she will first appear in a distance of at least 100 meters from\r\nthe nest. By means of short, snarling, and faint cries and now and then\r\nby flying up, she will then try to turn one's attention to herself. She\r\nwill often settle for some moments on small stones, clods of earth, and\r\nsimilar places, from which she again will rush away with her dorsal\r\nfeathers erected and her wings hanging down and always in a direction\r\nopposite to that in which her nest is situated.\r\n\r\nH. E. Dresser (1904) gives a translation of notes on this species made\r\nby Dr. H. Walter in the Taimyr Peninsula, from which I quote as follows:\r\n\r\n     The nests, found late in June and early in July, contained four\r\n     eggs each in three cases and three eggs in one case. The nest was\r\n     placed, unlike that of the other waders, which affected the\r\n     grass-covered portions of the tundra, between bare clay lumps on\r\n     moss, and consisted of a shallow depression lined with a few dry\r\n     straws and a white tangle. In two cases the male, and in two the\r\n     female, was incubating. On the 16/29 July, when the young in down\r\n     were taken, the male showed anxiety, but the female was not seen.\r\n     During the breeding season some of these birds wandered about in\r\n     small flocks. This species remained until the end of August.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The sanderling lays four eggs, sometimes only three. The eggs\r\nare very rare in collections and few are available for study, but they\r\nhave been well described and fully illustrated. The eggs taken by Doctor\r\nWalter are described by Mr. Dresser (1904) as follows:\r\n\r\n     Blunt pyriform, fine grained, with a faint gloss. Ground color pale\r\n     yellowish white, with a very pale greenish tinge and somewhat\r\n     marked with small yellowish brown and dark brown spots; a few\r\n     indistinct light violet gray markings; at the larger end a few\r\n     blackish dots and streaks.\r\n\r\nIn the colored illustrations of 10 eggs before me, the shapes vary from\r\novate pyriform, the prevailing shape, to subpyriform. The prevailing\r\nground colors are greenish olive, \"ecru-olive,\" \"lime green,\" or \"grape\r\ngreen\"; a few eggs are more buffy, \"cream buff\" to \"deep olive buff.\"\r\nThe markings are small, and often inconspicuous, spots, scattered quite\r\nevenly over the entire surface, but sometimes more thickly about the\r\nlarger end. These are in dull shades of brown, \"buffy brown,\" \"snuff\r\nbrown,\" or \"sepia.\" They are not handsome or showy eggs. The\r\nmeasurements of 41 eggs, furnished by Rev. F. C. R. Jourdain, average\r\n35.7 by 24.7 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure\r\n=38.2= by 24.7, 34.1 by =26.1=, =33.1= by 24.4 and 35.3 by =23.5=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Authorities seem to differ as to whether both sexes incubate\r\nor not. Both Feilden and Walter secured incubating males, but Manniche\r\n(1910) says:\r\n\r\n     Till the laying is finished both birds will faithfully accompany\r\n     each other, but as soon as the brooding begins, the males will join\r\n     in smaller flocks and wander around on the table lands and at the\r\n     beaches of the fresh waters, often in company with _Tringa canutus_\r\n     and _Strepsilas interpres_. They usually left the country some days\r\n     before the middle of July. I secured several males for examination\r\n     but never found the least sign of a breeding spot.\r\n\r\nHe gives the period of incubation as 23 to 24 days and says of the\r\nyoung:\r\n\r\n     The bursting of the egg shells will generally begin already some\r\n     three days before the emergence of the young. The mother bird will\r\n     immediately carefully carry the shells away from the nest in order\r\n     not to attract the attention of ravens and skuas. Between the\r\n     emergence of the young will elapse not more than a few hours; as\r\n     soon as the latest born young one feels sufficiently strong; that\r\n     is, when the down is dry, all the nestlings will leave the nest at\r\n     the same time. If the old female considers the nearest surroundings\r\n     of the nest to be unsafe or too difficult in food for the brood,\r\n     she will immediately lead the young away. Thus I have met with\r\n     newly hatched young ones, hardly one hour after their departure\r\n     from the nest in a distance of 500 to 600 meters from this. In the\r\n     cases concerned the disturbance by my frequent visits to the nests\r\n     during the breeding may have caused the early departure.\r\n\r\n     In the following 12 to 14 days the chicks are guarded by their\r\n     careful and extremely vigilant mother, who leads them over stony\r\n     plains, by overflows of melted snow and fresh-water beaches; they\r\n     are eagerly occupied in seeking food, which at this period\r\n     exclusively consists of small insects and larvae and pupae of\r\n     these. I have often observed that the chicks take shelter under\r\n     the wings of their mother from the cold nights and the heavy\r\n     showers. The chicks' power of resistance against cold and severe\r\n     weather is relatively small.\r\n\r\n     When the sanderling wants to protect her young ones against\r\n     hostile attacks she executes still more surprising systematic\r\n     tactics than she does when brooding. Already when at a distance of\r\n     some 200 to 300 meters from the young ones the old female would\r\n     rush toward me and by all kinds of flapping and creeping movements\r\n     in an opposite direction try to lead me astray; all the while she\r\n     would squeak like a young one, and now growl angrily, striving to\r\n     draw my attention toward herself only. Now and then she would rise\r\n     very high in the air in a direct rapid flight, to disappear behind\r\n     a rock on the opposite beach of a lake, etc. From quite another\r\n     direction she soon appeared again just before my feet.\r\n\r\n     If I finally retired still farther away from the young ones and for\r\n     a while kept myself hidden in the field, she would fly slowly,\r\n     sometimes quite low, over the earth to the spot where the young\r\n     still were lying motionless and mute, with their bodies pressed\r\n     flat against the earth and their neck and head stretched out. When\r\n     at last the female considers the danger to be over, she, flying or\r\n     running close to the chicks, produces a short chirping song, at the\r\n     tones of which all four young ones suddenly get up and begin to run\r\n     about. Only in this case the sanderling produces its highly\r\n     peculiar \"sanderling song,\" which is very similar to the song of\r\n     _Sylvia curruca_. As long as the young kept lying quiet on the\r\n     ground in the before-mentioned attitude they were extremely\r\n     difficult to find, if I had not from my ambush by aid of my field\r\n     glass exactly marked down the spot where they last appeared. The\r\n     young ones do not seek any real cover, as in hollows in the ground,\r\n     under plants, behind stones, or similar natural hiding places. When\r\n     I had found a single young one, which while I kept it in my hands\r\n     began to chirp, it generally happened that the three other young,\r\n     which had till then kept quiet, suddenly rose and, with the wings\r\n     raised, uttered a quite fine mouse-like squeaking and hastily\r\n     rushed away, while the old female, as if paralyzed, lay down before\r\n     my feet, still squeaking exactly like the chicks.\r\n\r\n     Within 12 to 14 days the young ones are full grown and able to\r\n     fly. Strange to say, the brood of the sanderling seems to suffer\r\n     very little from hostile persecution, a fact which may be due to\r\n     the accomplished vigilance and prudent behaviour of the old female\r\n     and the young as well as the extremely suitably coloured clothing\r\n     of these. I wonder that these defenceless small beings can avoid\r\n     the Polar fox, which in this season more frequently than usual\r\n     visits the domain of the waders, and which, as well known, has an\r\n     excellent sense of smell.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The nestling sanderling is thus described in Witherby's\r\nHandbook (1920):\r\n\r\n     Forehead buff with a median black line from base of upper mandible\r\n     to crown; nape buff, down with dusky bases; rest of upper parts\r\n     variegated light buff, warm buff and black and more or less\r\n     spangled white; lores buff, two black lines across lores toward\r\n     eye; under parts white, cheeks, chin and throat suffused light\r\n     buff.\r\n\r\nMr. Manniche (1910) gives a colored plate showing four ages of downy\r\nyoung sanderlings, which the above description fits. A nestling 7 days\r\nold shows the remiges about one-third grown, while the body is still all\r\ndowny. Another nearly fully grown only 11 days old is still downy on the\r\nhead, neck, rump, and crissum, but is nearly fully feathered on the\r\nmantle and wings, partly feathered on the under parts and the wings\r\nextend beyond the stump of a tail; it must be close to the flight stage.\r\nSuch is the rapid development of these little Arctic birds that Mr.\r\nManniche (1910) says that they can fly when 14 days old.\r\n\r\nIn fresh juvenal plumage in the Arctic the feathers of the crown,\r\nmantle, wing coverts, scapulars, and tertials are blackish brown,\r\nbroadly tipped, and all except those of the crown are also notched, with\r\nbuff; the sides of the head, neck, and breast are washed with buff;\r\nbefore these birds reach us on migration these buff tints have mostly\r\nfaded out to creamy yellow or white; the feathers of the lower back,\r\nrump, and upper tail coverts are ashy brown or grayish buff, each with a\r\ndusky shaft streak and narrowly tipped with dusky; as these feathers are\r\nnot molted during the first winter they produce a peculiar rump pattern\r\nby which young birds can be easily recognized. Young birds are in\r\njuvenal plumage when they arrive here, with conspicuous black and white\r\nbacks. But the postjuvenal molt begins in September and is generally\r\ncompleted before November; this molt involves the body plumage, except\r\nthe rump, and some of the wing coverts and tertials. The first winter\r\nplumage is like that of the adult, plain gray above and white below,\r\nexcept for the retained juvenal feathers as indicated above.\r\n\r\nA partial, or perhaps nearly complete, prenuptial molt takes place in\r\nyoung birds between March and May, involving the body plumage, sometimes\r\nthe tail and most of the scapulars and wing coverts. In this first\r\nnuptial plumage young birds are much like adults, but can be recognized\r\nby some retained wing coverts and tertials; the latter are shorter than\r\nin adults, reaching not quite to the tip of the fourth primary in the\r\nfolded wing; in the adult wing the tertials reach nearly to the tip of\r\nthe third primary. At the next molt, the first postnuptial, the adult\r\nwinter plumage is assumed.\r\n\r\nAdults have a complete postnuptial molt from July to October or later.\r\nThe body plumage is molted first, mainly in August and September, and\r\nthe wings later, mainly in October; specimens have been seen with\r\nprimaries in molt in February and March, but these are probably\r\nabnormal. The prenuptial molt of adults is incomplete, involving nearly\r\nall of the body plumage, but not all of the feathers of the back,\r\nscapulars, tertials, or wing coverts. The fresh nuptial plumage in early\r\nMay is veiled with broad grayish white tips, which soon wear away. There\r\nis great individual variation in the amount of red assumed and in the\r\nmolting date.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The sanderling obtains most of its food by probing in the wet\r\nsand of the seashore or by picking up what is washed up and left by the\r\nreceding waves. The former method is well described by Dr. Charles W.\r\nTownsend (1920) as follows:\r\n\r\n     On the hard wet sand of the beaches one may see in places the\r\n     characteristic probings of the sanderling without a trace of their\r\n     foot marks, and these may be the cause of considerable mystery to\r\n     the uninitiated. While the semipalmated sandpiper runs about with\r\n     his head down dabbing irregularly here and there, the sanderling\r\n     vigorously probes the sand in a series of holes a quarter of an\r\n     inch to an inch apart in straight or curving lines a foot to 2 feet\r\n     long. Sometimes the probings are so near together that the line is\r\n     almost a continuous one like the furrow of a miniature plough. The\r\n     sand is thrown up in advance so that one can tell in which\r\n     direction the bird is going. A close inspection of the probings\r\n     often reveals their double character, showing that the bill was\r\n     introduced partly open. The probings are for the minute sand fleas\r\n     and other crustaceans in the sand, their principal food. I have\r\n     seen sanderlings running about nimbly on the beach, catching the\r\n     sand fleas which were hopping on the surface. I have also seen them\r\n     catching flies. I have a record of one I shot in 1884, whose\r\n     stomach was stuffed with small specimens of the common mussel,\r\n     _Mytilus edulis_.\r\n\r\nThe food consists mainly of sand fleas, shrimps, and other small\r\ncrustaceans, small mollusks, marine worms, flies, fly larvae, and other\r\ninsects, and sometimes a few seeds. Early in the season in the Arctic\r\nregions when animal life of all kinds is scarce the sanderling is said\r\nto subsist on the buds of saxifrage and other plants, as well as bits of\r\nmoss and algae.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--I have always loved to walk by the seashore alone with\r\nNature, and especially to tramp for miles over the hard sands of our\r\nocean beaches, where the heaving bosom of the restless sea sends its\r\nflood of foaming breakers rolling up the steep slopes, cut into hills\r\nand valleys by the action of the waves. From the crest of the beach\r\nabove or from the lonely sand dunes beyond comes the mellow whistle of\r\nthe plover, disturbed in his reveries; out over the blue waters a few\r\nterns are flitting about or screaming in anxiety for their, now well\r\ngrown, young perched on the beach. Flocks of small shore birds hurry\r\npast well out over the breakers, flashing light or dark, as they wheel\r\nand turn; and high overhead the big gray gulls are circling. But right\r\nat our feet is one of the characteristic features of the ocean beach, a\r\nlittle flock of feeding sanderlings, confiding little fellows,\r\napparently unmindful of our presence. They run along ahead of us as fast\r\nas we can walk, their little black legs fairly twinkling with rapid\r\nmotion. They are intent only on picking up their little bits of food and\r\nmost skillfully avoid the incoming wave by running up the beach just\r\nahead of it; occasionally a wave overtakes one when it flutters above\r\nit; then as the wave recedes they run rapidly down with it, quickly\r\npicking up what food they find. If we force them to fly, which they seem\r\nreluctant to do, they circle out over the waves and settle on the beach\r\nagain a short distance ahead of us; by repeating this maneuver again and\r\nagain they lead us on and on up the beach, until, tired of being\r\ndisturbed, they finally make a wide circle out over the water around us\r\nand alight on the beach far behind us. Their flight is swift, direct,\r\nand generally low over the water, with less of the twistings and\r\nturnings so common among shore birds. They usually flock by themselves,\r\nbut are often associated in small numbers with knots, small plovers, or\r\nother beach-loving species. When satiated with food or tired of\r\nstrenuous activity, they retire to the crest of the beach, or the broad\r\nsloping sand plains beyond it, to rest and doze or preen their plumage.\r\nHere they stand or squat on the sand, often in immense flocks, all\r\nfacing the wind. Their colors match their surroundings so well that they\r\nare not conspicuous and I have often been surprised to see them rise.\r\nThese large flocks are generally wary and not easily approached. But\r\nsmall parties or single birds feeding along the surf line are very tame\r\nand if we sit quietly on the beach, they will often run up quite close\r\nto us. Like many other shore birds, they are fond of standing on one leg\r\nor even hopping about on it for a long time, as if one leg were missing;\r\noften a number of birds will be seen all doing this at the same time, as\r\nif playing a sort of game; but if we watch them long enough, the other\r\nleg will come down, for they are not cripples.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--J. T. Nichols writes to me of the limited vocabulary of this\r\nbird, as follows:\r\n\r\n     The note of the sanderling is a soft _ket, ket, ket_, uttered\r\n     singly or in series somewhat querulous in tone. It is at times used\r\n     in taking wing, also with variations in the conversational\r\n     twittering of a feeding flock. The sanderling is a rather silent\r\n     bird at all times and seems to have a comparatively limited\r\n     vocabulary.\r\n\r\n_Field Marks._--The sanderling is well named \"whitey\" or \"whiting,\" for\r\nthe large amount of white in its plumage, particularly in late summer,\r\nfall, and winter, is one of its best field marks. In winter it appears\r\nto be nearly all white while on the ground, against which the stiff\r\nblack legs, the rather heavy black bill and a dark area at the bend of\r\nthe wing stand out in sharp contrast. In flight the broad white stripe\r\nin the wing, contrasted with black, is diagnostic; and the tail appears\r\nwhite, or nearly so, with a dark center. Young birds in the fall can be\r\nrecognized by the mottled black and white back. Its foot prints in the\r\nsand are recognizable, as well as the probings made by its bill.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Mr. Manniche (1910) observed the flocking of the young\r\nsanderlings in Greenland, during August, prior to their departure about\r\nthe end of that month; he writes:\r\n\r\n     The flocks of sanderlings every day increase in size till they\r\n     culminate about August 20th. August 21st, 1906, I met on the shore\r\n     at Hvalrosodden with a flock numbering at least 300 sanderlings. I\r\n     walked there toward evening and, as the weather was unusualy fine,\r\n     the birds were very lively; the imposingly large flock of birds\r\n     executed evolutions in the air with incredible dexterity, now\r\n     scattered and then in a compact column, now very high in the air\r\n     and then close to the glassy level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe first adults reach Massachusetts in July and are common or abundant\r\nduring the latter part of that month and through August. The earlier\r\narrivals are in worn spring plumage, but all stages of body molt are\r\nseen during their stay with us. The young birds come along in the latter\r\npart of August and are most abundant in September and October, after\r\nthe adults have gone. The earlier migrants are generally in small flocks\r\nor little groups, but the late storms often bring along immense flocks,\r\nwhich settle on the beaches in dense masses or sweep along between the\r\ncrests of the waves in great clouds.\r\n\r\nThe sanderling is a common migrant, sometimes abundant, throughout the\r\ninterior east of the Rocky Mountains, coming along at about the same\r\ndates as on the Atlantic coast. Prof. William Rowan tells me of a bird\r\nhe shot in Alberta on November 8, 1902, that was feeding with a Baird\r\nsandpiper \"on the ice of a completely frozen lake.\" It is a common\r\nmigrant on the Pacific coast at about the same dates as elsewhere. D. E.\r\nBrown (notes) records it at Grays Harbor, Washington, as late as\r\nDecember 20, 1917.\r\n\r\n_Game._--In the old days, before the shooting of small shore birds was\r\nprohibited by law, sanderlings ranked as game birds among the beach\r\ngunners. They were popular because they were so abundant and so tame\r\nthat they could be shot in large numbers, especially when flying in\r\nlarge flocks. They are exceedingly fat in the fall and are delicious to\r\neat. A favorite method of shooting them was to dig a hole in the sand of\r\nthe beach, as near the water as practicable, in which the gunner could\r\nhide and shoot into the flocks as they flew by. Dr. Charles W. Townsend\r\n(1905) tells of a man who, in 1872, \"saw two baskets, each holding half\r\na bushel and rounded full of these birds,\" shot by one man between\r\ntides.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--The winter home of the sanderling is extensive. A few birds\r\nsometimes spend the winter as far north as Massachusetts. They are\r\ncommon on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from North Carolina southward, as\r\nwell as on the Pacific coast up to central California at least. From\r\nthese northern points the winter range extends southward to central\r\nArgentina and Chile, and even farther south. On the west coast of\r\nFlorida, where I spent the winter of 1924-25, sanderlings were common\r\nall winter, associating with red-backed sandpipers and other small\r\nwaders on the extensive sand flats, or with knots and piping plovers on\r\nthe beaches. It was interesting to note how tame they were on the\r\nprotected bathing beaches and how wild they were elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Cosmopolitan; breeding in Arctic or subarctic regions and\r\nwintering mainly south of 40 degrees north latitude.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--In North America the breeding range of the sanderling\r\nextends north to Alaska (Point Barrow); northern Franklin (Price of\r\nWales Strait, Bay of Mercy, and probably Winter Harbor); northern Grant\r\nLand (Floeberg Beach); Grinnell Land; northern Greenland (Thank God\r\nHarbor, Stormkap, and Shannon Island); and perhaps Iceland (Mickla\r\nIsland). East to Iceland (Mickla Island); southern Greenland (Glacier\r\nValley and Godthaab); and eastern Franklin (Igloolik and Winter Island).\r\nSouth to Franklin (Winter Island); Keewatin (Cape Fullerton); Mackenzie\r\n(Bernard Harbor and Franklin Bay); and Alaska (probably Barter Island\r\nand Point Barrow). West to Alaska (Point Barrow).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--In the Western Hemisphere the sanderling ranges in\r\nwinter north to: Washington (Dungeness Spit and Smith Island);\r\nsoutheastern California (Salton Sea); Texas (Corpus Christi, Aransas\r\nRiver, Refugio County, and Galveston); Louisiana (State Game Preserve);\r\nwestern Florida (probably Pensacola and Bagdad); and rarely\r\nMassachusetts (Plymouth County). East to rarely Massachusetts (Harvard,\r\nDennis, Muskeget Island, and Nantucket); rarely New York (Long Beach);\r\nrarely New Jersey (Long Beach and Cape May); Virginia (Virginia Beach\r\nand Cobb Island); North Carolina (Pea Island, Cape Hatteras, and Fort\r\nMacon); Bermuda; South Carolina (Mount Pleasant and Frogmore); Georgia\r\n(Savannah and Darien); Florida (Amelia Island, Seabreeze, Mosquito\r\nInlet, and Key West); Bahama Islands (Andros, Watling, and Fortune\r\nIslands); Jamaica; Lesser Antilles (probably Barbados); Brazil (Cajetuba\r\nIsland and Iguape); and Argentina (Misiones, San Vicente, and Tombo\r\nPoint). South to Argentina (Tombo Point); and Chile (Coquimbo Bay). West\r\nto Chile (Coquimbo Bay); Peru (mouth of the Tambo River and Chorillos);\r\nEcuador (Santa Elena); Galapagos Islands (Bindloe and Albemarle\r\nIslands); probably Colombia (Carthagena). Vera Cruz (Barra de\r\nSantecomapan); Lower California (San Jose del Cabo, Santa Margarita\r\nIsland, San Cristobal Bay, and Cedros Island); California (San Diego,\r\nSan Clemente Island, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, Bolinas, and Point\r\nReyes); Oregon (Netarts Bay); and Washington (Grays Harbor and Dungeness\r\nSpit).\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--Early dates of arrival in the spring are: Maine,\r\nAugusta, April 11, and Saco, May 5; Franklin, Bay of Mercy, June 3,\r\nPrince of Wales Strait, June 7, Walker Bay, June 9, Winter Island, June\r\n10, and Igloolik, June 16;

Although but a\r\nshort distance from the coast, there are only five records for the\r\nvicinity of Washington, D. C. (September, 1874, October 24, 1885,\r\nSeptember 22, 1894, September 26-30, 1898, and September 27, 1898). It\r\nhas been taken once in Kansas (Lawrence, October 7, 1874).

Arctic Canada: two records, June 18 and 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMOSA FEDOA (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\nMARBLED GODWIT\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nNext to the long-billed curlew and the oyster catchers, this is the\r\nlargest of our shore birds. For that reason and for other reasons it is\r\nrapidly disappearing, and before many years it may join the ranks of\r\nthose that are gone but not forgotten. Although shy at times, it is\r\noften foolishly tame and is then easily slaughtered. It is large enough\r\nto appeal to the sportsman as legitimate game and it makes a plump and\r\ntoothsome morsel for the table. But, worst of all, its breeding grounds\r\non the prairies and meadows of the central plains are becoming more and\r\nmore restricted by the encroachments of agriculture; the wide-open\r\nsolitudes will soon be only memories of the past.\r\n\r\nIn Audubon's (1840) time this was an abundant species and much more\r\nwidely distributed than it is to-day. He writes:\r\n\r\n     On the 31st of May, 1832, I saw an immense number of these birds on\r\n     an extensive mud bar bordering one of the Keys of Florida, about 6\r\n     miles south of Cape Sable. When I landed with my party the whole,\r\n     amounting to some\r\n     thousands, collected in the manner mentioned above. Four or five\r\n     guns were fired at once, and the slaughter was such that I was\r\n     quite satisfied with the number obtained, both for specimens and\r\n     for food. For this reason we refrained from firing at them again,\r\n     although the temptation was at times great, as they flew over and\r\n     wheeled round us for awhile, until at length they alighted at some\r\n     distance and began to feed.\r\n\r\nThe marbled godwit is a rare bird in Florida to-day; I saw only one\r\nduring the five months of my last winter on the west coast. It was\r\nformerly abundant as a migrant on the Atlantic coast from New England\r\nsouthward, where now it is merely a straggler. It is still fairly common\r\non the Pacific coast, where probably most of the birds now go. Even in\r\nMinnesota, close to its present breeding grounds, it has decreased\r\nenormously. Dr. Thomas S. Roberts (1919) writes:\r\n\r\n     When the writer, in company with Franklin Benner, went to Grant and\r\n     Traverse Counties in June, 1879, to study the wild life of that\r\n     region, the great marbled godwit was so abundant, so constant and\r\n     insistent in its attentions to the traveler on the prairie, and so\r\n     noisy that it became at times an actual nuisance. They were\r\n     continually hovering about the team, perfectly fearless and nearly\r\n     deafening us with their loud, harsh cries--\"go-wit, go-wit.\" On\r\n     getting out of the wagon to search for their nests, the birds\r\n     became fairly frantic until we were fain to stop our ears to shut\r\n     out the din. Now and then the birds would all disappear and peace\r\n     would ensue for a brief period, but they had only retired to muster\r\n     their forces anew, for shortly a great company would bear down upon\r\n     us, flying low over the prairie, and spread out in wide array, all\r\n     the birds silent, until, when almost upon us, they swerved suddenly\r\n     upward over our heads and broke out again in a wild, discordant\r\n     clamor. Once I counted 50 birds in one of these charging companies.\r\n     This, to us, novel experience, went on from day to day in various\r\n     places and has left a vivid impression that can never be effaced.\r\n     Happenings of this sort have long since become things of the past\r\n     in Minnesota. The godwits gradually disappeared before conditions\r\n     associated with the advance of man into their domain until now it\r\n     is doubtful that more than an occasional pair remains to nest in\r\n     some remote part of the State.\r\n\r\nThe godwits have always been favorites with me and in my early days I\r\nhad always longed to see them. The opportunity came at last when I\r\nvisited North Dakota in 1901. We had been collecting for several days in\r\nsome extensive sloughs bordering a large lake in Steele County, which we\r\nfound exceedingly rich in bird life, when on June 12 I first made the\r\nacquaintance of this magnificent wader. The beautiful Wilson's\r\nphalaropes were flitting about among the tussocks, and it was while\r\nhunting for their nests that we noticed, among the numerous noisy\r\nkilldeers and western willets flying over us, a strange hoarse note,\r\nstrikingly different from either, as a large brown bird flew past, which\r\nwe recognized as a godwit. All doubts were soon dispelled by collecting\r\nmy first specimen of a species I had often longed to see, and I could\r\nnot help pausing to examine and admire the beautiful markings of its\r\nrichly colored wings. We saw only four of these birds that day, but on\r\nthe following day they became more abundant. There were about 20 of them\r\nflying about over the meadows, showing considerable concern at our\r\npresence, constantly uttering their peculiar cries, and showing so\r\nlittle regard for their own safety that we were led to infer that they\r\nwere breeding or intending to breed in that vicinity. We spent some time\r\nlooking for their nests, but as we knew practically nothing about their\r\nnesting habits at that time, we were not successful in locating any\r\nnests.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--I can not find that the marbled godwit was ever common on the\r\nAtlantic coast north of Florida in the spring. It still migrates\r\nnorthward along the Pacific coast, mainly in April; D. E. Brown has seen\r\nit at Gray's Harbor, Washington, as early as April 9. The main migration\r\nroute seems to be up the Mississippi Valley, mainly in April; it has\r\nbeen recorded in southern Saskatchewan as early as April 16.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--In southwestern Saskatchewan, in 1905 and 1906, I became\r\nbetter acquainted with the marbled godwit on its breeding grounds. Along\r\nthe lower courses of the streams, near the lakes, but sometimes\r\nextending for a mile or more back from the lake, are usually found\r\nbroad, flat, alluvial plains, low enough to be flooded during periods of\r\nhigh water. These plains are more or less moist at all times, are\r\nexceedingly level, and are covered with short, thick grass only a few\r\ninches high. Such spots are the chosen breeding grounds of the marbled\r\ngodwit, and, so far as our experience goes, the nests of this species\r\nare invariably placed on these grassy plains or meadows.\r\n\r\nThe godwit makes no attempt at concealment, the eggs being deposited in\r\nplain sight in a slight hollow in the short grass. We found, in all,\r\nfour nests of this species with eggs, had two sets of eggs brought to us\r\nby ranchmen, and found two broods of young. The first nest was\r\ndiscovered on May 29, 1905. We had been hunting the shores of a large\r\nalkaline lake, where a colony of avocets were breeding on the mud flats\r\nnear the outlet of a deep, sluggish stream, and it was while following\r\nalong the banks of this stream, as it wound its devious course down\r\nthrough a series of broad, flat meadows, that I flushed a godwit out of\r\nthe short grass only a few yards from the stream and about 100 yards\r\nfrom the lake. On investigation I found that she had flown from her\r\nnest, merely a slight hollow in the grass lined with dry grass, which\r\nhad, apparently, been simply trodden down where it grew, without the\r\naddition of any new material brought in by the birds. Only two eggs had\r\nbeen laid, so we marked the spot for future reference and retired. On\r\nJune 5 this nest was photographed, and the four eggs which it then\r\ncontained were collected.\r\n\r\nWhile driving across a low, wet meadow, toward a reedy lake, on June 8,\r\n1905, and when about 200 yards from the lake, we were surprised to see\r\na marbled godwit flutter out from directly under the horse, which was\r\ntrotting along at a leisurely pace. We stopped as soon as possible and\r\nfound that we had driven directly over its nest, which barely escaped\r\ndestruction, for it lay between the wheel ruts and the horse's\r\nfootprints, one of which was within a few inches of it. The nest was in\r\nevery way similar to the first one, the bird having beaten down the\r\nshort grass to form a slight hollow in which the four handsome eggs had\r\nbeen laid in plain sight.\r\n\r\nOn June 9, 1906, we visited the locality where the first nest was found,\r\nand I enjoyed a most interesting experience with an unusually tame\r\nindividual of this normally shy species. While walking across the flat\r\nmeadow near the creek, I happened to see a marbled godwit crouching on\r\nher nest beside a pile of horse droppings. She was conspicuous enough in\r\nspite of her protective coloration, for the nest was entirely devoid of\r\nconcealment in the short grass. Though we stood within 10 feet of her,\r\nshe showed no signs of flying away, which suggested the possibility of\r\nphotographing her. My camera was half a mile away in our wagon, but I\r\nsoon returned with it and began operations at a distance of 15 feet,\r\nsetting up the camera on the tripod and focussing carefully. I moved up\r\ncautiously to within 10 feet and took another picture, repeating the\r\nperformance again within 5 feet. She still sat like a rock, and I made\r\nbold to move still closer, spreading the legs of the tripod on either\r\nside of her and placing the camera within 3 feet of her; I hardly dared\r\nto breathe, moving very slowly as I used the focussing cloth, and\r\nchanged my plate holders most cautiously; but she never offered to move\r\nand showed not the slightest signs of fear, while I exposed all the\r\nplates I had with me, photographing her from both sides and placing the\r\nlens within 2 feet of her. She sat there patiently, panting in the hot\r\nsun, apparently distressed by the heat, perhaps partially dazed by it,\r\nand much annoyed by the ants which were constantly crawling into her\r\neyes and half open bill, causing her to wink or shake her head\r\noccasionally. I reached down carefully and stroked her on the back, but\r\nstill she did not stir, and I was finally obliged to lift her off the\r\nnest in order to photograph the eggs.\r\n\r\nTwo nests found by Gerard A. Abbott (1919) in Benson County, North\r\nDakota, were evidently better concealed than the nests we found. He\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     I was certainly surprised to discover my first godwit's nest with\r\n     the parent crouching beneath a little screen of woven grass blades\r\n     on four heavily blotched eggs. Her general contour and the\r\n     situation and design of the nest was suggestive of many king rails\r\n     whose nests I have found, after noticing how the grass blades were\r\n     woven together canopy like to shield the bird and her treasures.\r\n     About a mile from this nest and screened on one side by willow\r\n     sprouts sat another tame godwit. This time the grassy hollow held\r\n     five boldly marked eggs. Incubation was one-half completed and the\r\n     date was June 8. These five eggs bear a general resemblance to each\r\n     other and I believe they are all the product of the same bird.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The marbled godwit lays four eggs regularly, very rarely three\r\nand still more rarely five. The eggs are ovate or ovate pyriform in\r\nshape, with a slight gloss. The ground colors usually run from \"pale\r\nolive buff\" to \"deep olive buff,\" in the greener types from \"dark olive\r\nbuff\" to \"ecru olive,\" and in the brownest types to \"Isabella color.\"\r\nThey are more or less sparingly and irregularly marked with small\r\nrounded spots, and with irregular, rarely elongated blotches; these are\r\noften thicker at the larger end, but seldom confluent. The markings are\r\nusually much more conspicuous than in other godwit's eggs, but they are\r\nin dull browns, such as \"Saccardo's umber,\" \"warm sepia,\" and \"bister.\"\r\nThe underlying spots and blotches range in color from \"pallid brownish\r\ndrab\" to \"deep brownish drab.\" Some of the greenish types are only\r\nfaintly spotted with \"light brownish olive.\" One very handsome egg has a\r\n\"pale olive buff\" ground color, conspicuously splashed and blotched with\r\n\"pale Quaker drab,\" overlaid with a few small blotches and scrawls of\r\n\"Saccardo's umber.\" The measurements of 64 eggs average 57 by 39.6\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =61= by 40.5,\r\n59.5 by =42.5=, =51= by 38.5, and 53.7 by =37.7= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--I have no data on the period of incubation and do not know\r\nwhether both sexes incubate or not. The only incubating bird I collected\r\nwas a female. Though we looked diligently for the young we did not\r\nsucceed in finding any until June 27, 1906. We were driving across some\r\nextensive wet meadows, ideal breeding grounds for marbled godwits, when\r\nwe saw a godwit, about a hundred yards ahead of us, leading two of its\r\nyoung across a shallow grassy pool; we drove toward them as fast as we\r\ncould, but as we drew near the old bird took wing and the young\r\nseparated, moving off into the grass in opposite directions. They had\r\nevidently been well schooled in the art of hiding and were well fitted\r\nby their protective coloring to escape notice, for, though we secured\r\none of them readily enough while it was still running, the other\r\ndisappeared entirely right before our eyes and within 10 yards of us.\r\nIts disappearance seemed almost miraculous, for there was practically\r\nnothing there to conceal it, as the grass was quite short, and there\r\nwere no shrubs or herbaceous plants of any kind in the vicinity. We\r\nsearched the whole locality carefully and thoroughly, but in vain. The\r\nyoungster may have been crouching flat on the ground, relying on its\r\nresemblance to its surroundings, or it may have taken advantage of some\r\nslight inequalities in the ground and skulked away farther than we\r\nrealized. Later in the day we found another pair of godwits, in a\r\nsimilar locality, with two young, one of which we secured. The young\r\nwere in the downy stage, and apparently not over a week old. They showed\r\nunmistakable godwit characters, particularly in the shape of the head\r\nand bill, and the long legs and neck.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The downy young marbled godwit is in dull colors. The upper\r\nparts, including the posterior half of the crown, back rump, and wings\r\nare \"bone brown\" or \"light seal brown,\" variegated on the back and rump\r\nwith pale buff or grayish-white. The under parts, including the\r\nforehead, sides of the head, and neck, are \"pinkish-buff,\" deepest on\r\nthe neck and flanks, almost white on the belly and head and pure white\r\non the chin and cheeks. There is a narrow loral stripe, extending not\r\nquite to the eye, a spot behind the ear, and a short stripe in the\r\nmiddle of the lower forehead of blackish-brown. The shape of the head\r\nand bill is characteristic of the species.\r\n\r\nThe cinnamon juvenal plumage begins to appear on the flanks at an early\r\nstage and its development is rapid. Before the end of July the young\r\nbird is fully fledged and able to fly. The fresh juvenal plumage is much\r\nlike that of the adult in winter; but the throat and the sides of the\r\nhead and neck are plain cinnamon without dusky streaks; the feathers of\r\nthe back and scapulars are more broadly edged or notched, with brighter\r\ncinnamon; the greater and median wing coverts are much more broadly\r\nbordered with or more extensively cinnamon; the greater coverts are\r\nalmost clear cinnamon, with very few dusky markings; and the tail is\r\nmore broadly barred with dusky.\r\n\r\nApparently only a very limited amount of molt takes place during the\r\nfirst year. I have seen birds in juvenal or first winter plumage in\r\nNovember, January, and May, though the last two may be exceptional\r\ncases. Perhaps some young birds assume the adult plumage at the first\r\nprenuptial molt, but certainly not later than the first postnuptial.\r\nMore material is necessary to settle this point.\r\n\r\nAdults have a complete postnuptial molt beginning in July and lasting\r\nwell into the fall. This produces the winter plumage in which the breast\r\nis immaculate cinnamon and there is little, if any, barring on the\r\nflanks. At the prenuptial molt in February and March the body plumage,\r\nor most of it, and the tail are molted.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Doctor Roberts (1919) says of the feeding habits of the marbled\r\ngodwit:\r\n\r\n     With their long, up-curved bills they probe the shallow water of\r\n     sloughs and lake shores for aquatic insects and mollusks and also\r\n     spend much of their time on meadows and low-lying prairies, where\r\n     they devour grasshoppers and other insects of many kinds. These big\r\n     birds, when they were as abundant as they once were, must have been\r\n     an important factor in keeping in check the dangerous insect hordes\r\n     of our State. But they, with others of their kind, are gone and man\r\n     is left to fight conditions as he must with agencies of his own\r\n     devising, less efficient, perhaps, than those provided by nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudubon (1840) says: \"While feeding on the banks, it appears to search\r\nfor food between and under the oysters with singular care, at times\r\npushing the bill sidewise into the soft mud beneath the shells.\" The\r\nsand beaches of California are favorite feeding grounds, where I have\r\nseen it associated with the long-billed curlew. I was interested to see\r\nwith what dexterity these long-billed birds could pick up a small\r\nmollusk and swallow it; I could plainly see the small object gradually\r\ntravel up the long bill and into the mouth of the bird. Other observers\r\nhave recorded in the food of this godwit snails, crustaceans, insects\r\nand their larvae, worms, and leeches.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The flight of the marbled godwit is strong, rather swift\r\nand direct; the head is usually drawn in somewhat, the bill pointed\r\nstraight forward, and the feet stretched out behind. Audubon (1840)\r\nsays: \"When flying to a considerable distance, or migrating, they\r\nusually proceed in extended lines, presenting an irregular front, which\r\nrarely preserves its continuity for any length of time, but undulates\r\nand breaks as the birds advance.\" Mrs. Florence M. Bailey (1916) writes:\r\n\r\n     In flight they often made a close flock, calling _queep, queep,\r\n     queep, queep, queep_, affording a beautiful sight as the light\r\n     struck them and warmed up the cinnamon wings that make such a good\r\n     recognition mark. They soared down handsomely, showing the\r\n     cinnamon, and as they alighted held their wings straight over their\r\n     backs for a moment, the black shoulder straps showing in strong\r\n     contrast to the warm cinnamon.\r\n\r\n     Though the flocks were generally most amicable, occasionally one\r\n     or two of their number would get to scrapping. Two got hold of\r\n     each other's bills one day and held on, one or both crying\r\n     lustily. In a group another day two came to blows, first just\r\n     opening their bills at each other and talking argumentatively.\r\n     Later one of them made passes at the other till the harried bird\r\n     lifted his wings as if meditating escape, and finally when a pass\r\n     was made at his long unprotected legs, flew away. When one was\r\n     teased by a companion it often cried complainingly, _go-way,\r\n     go-way, go-way, go-way_.\r\n\r\n     It was amusing to watch the birds feed. As a wave rolled up,\r\n     combed over and broke, the white foam would chase them in, and as\r\n     they ran before it, if it came on too fast, they would pick\r\n     themselves up, open their wings till the cinnamon showed, and\r\n     scoot in like excited children. But the instant the water began to\r\n     recede they would right about face and trot back with it,\r\n     splashing it up so that you could see it glisten. As they went\r\n     their long bills--in the low afternoon sun strikingly coral red\r\n     except for the black tip--were shoved ahead of them, feeding along\r\n     through the wet sand, the light glinting from them; and if\r\n     anything good was discovered deeper, the hunters would stop to\r\n     probe, sometimes plunging the bill in up to the hilt, on rare\r\n     occasions when the tidbit proved out of reach, actually crowding\r\n     their heads down into the sand.\r\n\r\nLike all of the shore birds, the marbled godwit is exceedingly\r\ndemonstrative on its breeding grounds, flying out to meet the intruder\r\nas soon as he appears, making fully as much fuss at a distance from its\r\nnest as near it, and giving no clue as to its exact location. The cries\r\nof one pair of birds often attract others, and I have seen as many as\r\neighteen birds flying about at one time in an especially favorable\r\nlocality. It shows no signs of fear at such times, often alighting on\r\nthe ground within ten or fifteen yards, standing for an instant with its\r\nbeautifully marbled wings poised above it, a perfect picture of parental\r\nsolicitude. Even while they were feeding on the shores of the lakes we\r\ncould frequently walk up to within a few yards of them.\r\n\r\nHamilton M. Laing (1913), after describing how a snipe escaped from a\r\nduck hawk by diving into some rushes along a creek, tells of a similar\r\ntrick played by a godwit, as follows:\r\n\r\n     In the second chase, the victim marked for death was a marbled\r\n     godwit. Having often seen these birds swirling about at a dizzy\r\n     pace and listened to the roar of their long knife wings as they\r\n     smote the air in a playful descent, I felt assured that when the\r\n     hawk started after them he would be very much outclassed. Yet in\r\n     less than half a mile he was among them, had singled a victim and\r\n     was stooping wickedly. Each time the godwit dodged, he emitted an\r\n     angry or terrified cry, but the silent pursuer, with never a sign\r\n     of fatigue, swooped and swooped and wore him down. Each time now\r\n     the hawk overshot his mark a little less in the turnings. The last\r\n     resort of the godwit was exactly that of the other snipe, but the\r\n     former being over the big slough, dropped into the water. I saw the\r\n     hairbreadth escape and the splash, but whether or not the godwit\r\n     dived to get away, I could not tell. Some of the sandpipers can\r\n     dive well, and probably the godwit escaped thus.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The marbled godwit has a great variety of striking and\r\ncharacteristic notes. Its ordinary call note, when only slightly\r\ndisturbed, sounds like _terwhit, terwhit, terwhit_, or _pert-wurrit,\r\npert-wurrit_, or _godwit, godwit, godwit_, from which its name is\r\nprobably derived; these notes are all strongly accented on the last\r\nsyllable, and are uttered almost constantly while the birds are flying\r\nabout over their breeding grounds. When considerably alarmed these notes\r\nare intensified, more rapidly given, and with even more emphasis,\r\n_kerweek, kerwee-eek_, or _kerreck, kreck, kreck, kerreck_; sometimes\r\nthey are prolonged into a loud, long-drawn-out scream _quack,\r\nqua-a-ack_, or _quoick, quoi-i-ick_, somewhat between the loudest\r\nquacking of an excited duck and the scream of a red-shouldered hawk.\r\nThere is also a more musical, whistling note, less often heard, sounding\r\nlike the syllables _kor-koit_ or _ker-kor-koit, kor-koit_, the accent\r\nbeing on the _kor_ in each case; this note seems to indicate a more\r\nsatisfied frame of mind and is much more subdued in tone. All of these\r\nnotes are subject to great individual variation, and, as the godwits are\r\nvery noisy birds, we were given ample opportunities to study them, but\r\nto write them down in a satisfactory manner is not so easy.\r\n\r\nP. A. Tayerner (1926) writes: \"Their loud exasperating\r\n_eradica-radica-radica-radica_ varied with _Your-crazy-crazy-crazy_ and\r\nconfirmed by _Korect-korect_ sets all the prairie on the alert.\"\r\n\r\nJohn T. Nichols says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     A bird flying toward decoys gave a single unwhistled note, _hank_,\r\n     likely the flight note of the species in migration. Alighted, it\r\n     had a short, unloud note, a goose-like _honk_, especially when\r\n     other shore birds flew past (Long Island, August). The few godwits\r\n     of any species that I have seen in migration have mostly been\r\n     silent.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The marbled godwit is so large and so well marked as a\r\nbig brown bird that it is likely to be confused with only one other\r\nbird, the long-billed curlew. It nearly equals the curlew in size, and\r\nthe rich cinnamon color in the wings is conspicuous in both species, but\r\nthe long, curved bill of the curlew serves to distinguish it, even at a\r\nconsiderable distance, and the notes of the two birds are quite\r\ndifferent. At short range the shape of the head, the long, slightly\r\nupturned bill, pinkish buff on its basal third, and the bluish-gray legs\r\nare distinctive marks.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--As soon as the breeding season is over, or even before all the\r\nbroods are fledged, the marbled godwits begin to gather into flocks and\r\nbecome much more wary. Even as early as June 27, 1906, we saw as many as\r\n36 birds in one flock, but as we did not see any young birds among them\r\nwe inferred that these must have been birds whose eggs or young had been\r\ndestroyed. As I have always had to leave for the East before the\r\nsouthward migration began I am unable to give any information on this\r\nsubject from personal observation, but Dr. Louis B. Bishop has kindly\r\nplaced at my disposal his notes relating to this movement.\r\n\r\nAt Stump Lake, North Dakota, in 1902, he noted on July 28 a flock of\r\nabout 100 marbled godwits, chiefly adults, all that were taken being old\r\nbirds; and on July 30 he saw a flock of about 50, which he assumed to be\r\ncomposed chiefly of young birds, all that were taken being in juvenile\r\nplumage. At the same locality in 1905 he saw on July 26 a flock of about\r\n40, both adults and young, all that were collected being young birds; on\r\nAugust 2, _all_ of these birds had disappeared. This exact locality, a\r\nsandy point at the western end of the lake, was visited only on the\r\nabove dates. These birds were undoubtedly migrants, as they were not\r\nknown to have bred in that vicinity.\r\n\r\nAfter I had left Saskatchewan, Doctor Bishop visited the breeding\r\ngrounds of the marbled godwits, and on July 3, 1906, found adult birds\r\ntolerably common, but they had all departed two days later. At Big Stick\r\nLake, from July 18 to 21, 1906, he saw large flocks of adult godwits\r\ncontaining hundreds of birds, but on July 22 very few were left. He also\r\nwrites that adults reach the North Carolina coast in the middle of July,\r\nas he has in his collection adults taken on July 11 and 27, 1904, and\r\nthat young birds appear about a month later, as he has specimens taken\r\nAugust 10 and 19, 1904.\r\n\r\nEvidently the godwits move off their breeding grounds as soon as the\r\nyoung are able to fly, those birds which have been unsuccessful in\r\nrearing their young being the first to leave, and forming the vanguard\r\nof the early migration in July. Probably most of the adults start on\r\ntheir southward migration before the end of July, and well in advance of\r\nthe young, the later flight being composed almost entirely of young\r\nbirds, and moving more deliberately.\r\n\r\nThe fall migration is or was very well marked and rather unique; many\r\nindividuals formerly migrated almost due east from their breeding\r\ngrounds in the interior to the Atlantic coast of New England. Others\r\nstill continue to migrate westward to the Pacific coast and southward to\r\nthe Gulf coast. All of the earlier writers indicate that this was an\r\nabundant migrant on the Atlantic coast from New England southward about\r\nthe middle of the last century. The immense flocks which passed along\r\nour shores have been gradually disappearing until now only a few\r\nstraggling birds are ever seen. Probably what comparatively few birds\r\nare left migrate to the Atlantic coast farther south or to the Gulf or\r\nPacific coasts. Probably excessive shooting has driven them from their\r\nformer haunts. They have always been popular with sportsmen and have\r\nbeen slaughtered unmercifully. They share with some other species the\r\nfatal habit, prompted by sympathy or curiosity, of circling back again\r\nand again over their fallen companions after a flock has been shot into,\r\nso that it is an easy matter for the gunners to kill them in large\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nAlthough it breeds and lives on the grassy meadows of the interior, the\r\nmarbled godwit seems to prefer the seacoast on its migrations,\r\nfrequenting more rarely the shores of large lakes. It is common as a\r\nmigrant on the Pacific coast even as late as December, but it seems to\r\nbe absent from California in January and February. Bradford Torrey\r\n(1913) says:\r\n\r\n     I have seen godwits and willets together lining the grassy edge of\r\n     the flats for a long distance, and so densely massed that I mistook\r\n     them at first for a border of some kind of herbage. Thousands there\r\n     must have been; and when they rose at my approach, they made\r\n     something like a cloud; gray birds and brown birds so contrasted in\r\n     color as to be discriminated beyond risk of error, even when too\r\n     far away for the staring white wing patches of the willets to be\r\n     longer discernible.\r\n\r\n     As a flock there was no getting near them; I proved the fact to my\r\n     dissatisfaction more than once; but sitting quietly on the same\r\n     bay shore I have repeatedly known a single godwit or willet to\r\n     feed carelessly past me within the distance of a rod or two.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--It is a comparatively short journey for this godwit to its\r\nwinter home in the Gulf States and Central America. I have seen and\r\ncollected a few godwits in Florida, but it is now impossible to see\r\nthem in anything like the numbers mentioned by Audubon (1840) and\r\nMaynard (1896). The former says:\r\n\r\n     This fine bird is found during winter on all the large muddy flats\r\n     of the coast of Florida that are intermixed with beds of racoon\r\n     oysters. As the tide rises it approaches the shores, and betakes\r\n     itself to the wet savannahs. At this season it is generally seen in\r\n     flocks of five or six, searching for food in company with the\r\n     telltale, the yellow shanks, the long-billed curlew, and the white\r\n     ibis.\r\n\r\nThe latter writes:\r\n\r\n     The marbled godwits are very common in the South in winter, but\r\n     they are particularly abundant in Florida. Back of Amelia Island,\r\n     just south of St. Marys River, thus lying just on the extreme\r\n     northern confines of the State, are extensive flats on which are\r\n     pools that become partly dry during winter. These were the familiar\r\n     resorts of the godwits, and flocks of hundreds would gather around\r\n     them. They were quite wild while here, rising with deafening clamor\r\n     when approached, but they had become so attached to the locality\r\n     that they would merely circle about and alight on the borders of\r\n     some neighboring pool. From this point, southward along the eastern\r\n     coast as far as Merritts Island they were very numerous but were\r\n     not common at Miami, and I did not see them on the Keys. On the\r\n     west coast, however, they occurred in large numbers, especially on\r\n     the muddy flats about Cedar Keys. On Indian River I found the\r\n     godwits very unsuspicious, in so much so that I have frequently\r\n     killed them with dust shot.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North and Central America. The range of the marbled godwit is\r\nnow greatly restricted, the breeding areas being principally in North\r\nDakota and central Saskatchewan and it is now extremely rare in winter\r\nanywhere on the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--North to Alberta (probably Edmonton); Saskatchewan\r\n(Osler and Crescent Lake); Manitoba (Winnipeg); and Wisconsin (Iron\r\nCounty). East to Wisconsin (Iron County, Stoughton, and Lake\r\nKoshkonong); and Iowa (Newton). South to Iowa (Newton and probably Sioux\r\nCity); South Dakota (Miner County and probably Huron); and Montana\r\n(Billings). West to Montana (Billings and Strater); and Alberta\r\n(Medicine Hat and probably Edmonton). It also has been detected in\r\nsummer at Okanagan, British Columbia, Pelican Narrows, Saskatchewan,\r\nMoose Lake, Manitoba, and York Factory, Manitoba.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--North to Lower California (Magdalena Bay and La Paz);\r\nSinaloa (Mazatlan); Oaxaca (Tehuantepec); western Yucatan; probably\r\nTexas (Corpus Christi); probably Louisiana; and Georgia (Savannah). East\r\nto Georgia (Savannah and Darien); Florida (Amelia Island, Tarpon\r\nSprings, Fort Myers, and Miami); eastern Yucatan (Cozumel Island); and\r\nBritish Honduras (Belize). South to British Honduras (Belize); and\r\nGuatemala (Chiapam). West to Guatemala (Chiapam); probably Colima\r\n(Manzanillo); and Lower California (Magdalena Bay). Marbled godwits\r\nformerly wintered north to southeastern South Carolina (Frogmore) and\r\nthey are casual at this season in southern California (San Diego, Lake\r\nElsinore, La Jolla, and Humboldt Bay).\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--Early dates of arrival are: Missouri, St. Louis,\r\nApril 13, Boonville, April 16, and Corning, April 18; Illinois, Warsaw,\r\nApril 2, Calumet, April 4, and Rockford, April 8; Ohio, Lakeside, April\r\n20, and Columbus, April 21; Michigan, Ann Arbor, May 5; Iowa,\r\nEmmetsburg, April 21, and Gilbert Station, April 23; Minnesota, Heron\r\nLake, April 8, Wilder, April 19, and Goodhue, April 20; Nebraska,\r\nLincoln, April 18; North Dakota, Bismarck, April 30, Jamestown, May 1,\r\nand Harrisburg, May 5; Manitoba, Oak Lake, April 25, Reaburn, May 2,\r\nMargaret, May 7, and Winnipeg, May 11; Saskatchewan, Indian Head, April\r\n16, McLean, April 16, South Qu'Appelle, April 20, and Wiseton, April 24;\r\nColorado, Loveland, April 20, Larimer County, April 26; Wyoming,\r\nCheyenne, May 1, and Douglas, May 15; Montana, Milk River, May 18;\r\nAlberta, Flagstaff, May 10, and Alliance, May 11; California, Santa\r\nBarbara, April 27, San Buenaventura, April 28; and Washington, Grays\r\nHarbor, April 9.\r\n\r\nLate dates of spring departure are: Florida, Amelia Island, May 15;\r\nGeorgia, Wolf Island, April 30; South Carolina, Hilton Head, April 24;\r\nMissouri, Warrensburg, May 4, and Boonville, May 31; Illinois, Chicago,\r\nMay 26; Nebraska, Valentine, May 16; Colorado, Durango, May 28, and\r\nBarr, May 30; Lower California, San Martin Island, April 10, and Turtle\r\nBay, April 14; and California, Sandyland, June 9, Santa Barbara, June\r\n15, and Los Angeles, June 16.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--Early dates of arrival in the fall are: California,\r\nLos Angeles, July 7; Lower California, San Quentin, August 6, and Cape\r\nSan Lucas, September 9; Wyoming, Douglas, July 31; Colorado, Barr, June\r\n24; Illinois, Chicago, July 22; Ohio, Pelee Island, July 24; Maine, near\r\nPortland, August 8; New Hampshire, Seabrook, August 17, and Rye Beach,\r\nAugust 27; Massachusetts, Eastham, August 10; Connecticut, West Haven,\r\nAugust 26; New York, Lawrence, July 21; North Carolina, Pea and Brodie\r\nIslands, July 11; South Carolina, Ladys Island, August 21, and Bay\r\nPoint, August 24; and Florida, St. Marks, September 11.\r\n\r\nLate dates of fall departure are: California, Nigger Slough, November\r\n15, Humboldt Bay, December 7, and San Diego, December 12; Colorado,\r\nDenver, September 5, Boulder, September 18, and San Luis Lake, October\r\n1; Saskatchewan, Ravine Bank, August 25, and Defoe-Guernsey Camp, August\r\n26; Manitoba, Margaret, September 22; North Dakota, Charlson, September\r\n16, and Westhope, September 24; Nebraska, Lincoln, October 16; Michigan,\r\nNewberry, September 23; Ohio, Sandusky Bay, October 12; Illinois,\r\nnortheastern part, October 20; Quebec, Montreal, September 3; Maine,\r\nPopham Beach, September 13; Massachusetts, Newburyport, September 7; New\r\nYork, Shinnecock Bay, September 15; New Jersey, Cape May, September 14;\r\nNorth Carolina, Beaufort, November 17; and South Carolina, Mount\r\nPleasant, November 3.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--The marbled godwit has on several occasions been\r\nrecorded outside of its normal range principally to the south and east\r\nof its winter quarters. Among these are: Ecuador (Santa Rosa, 1877);\r\nLesser Antilles (Grenada, August 29, 1881, and also from the islands of\r\nCarriacou and Trinidad); Porto Rico (recorded from Boqueron by\r\nGundlach); and Cuba (recorded from Cardenas in September by Gundlach).\r\nIt also has been noted from Alabama (near Greensboro, in 1880, and\r\nDauphin Island, August 21, 1911); Ontario (Toronto, May 30, 1895, and\r\nJune 7, 1890); Arizona (San Pedro River, January 27, 1886); and Alaska\r\n(Ugashik, July 16 and 18, 1881, Nelson Island, July 5, 1910, and Point\r\nBarrow, August 26, 1897).\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Saskatchewan: 38 records, May 15 to June 27; 19 records,\r\nMay 30 to June 9. Minnesota and Dakotas: 16 records, May 10 to June 14;\r\n8 records, May 25 to June 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMOSA LAPPONICA BAUERI Naumann\r\n\r\nPACIFIC GODWIT\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThe bar-tailed godwit of Europe is represented in eastern Siberia and\r\nwestern Alaska by this larger race, with a more spotted rump. From the\r\nabove breeding grounds it migrates to a winter range in Australia, New\r\nZealand, and many oceanic islands. South of Alaska it is a mere\r\nstraggler in North America.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--On its spring migration the Pacific godwit passes through the\r\nAleutian Islands and the Pribilof Islands on its way to its breeding\r\ngrounds in northwestern Alaska. I saw two birds on Atka Island on June\r\n13, 1911, probably belated migrants; it has been said to breed near\r\nUnalaska, but this seems hardly likely. William Palmer (1899) reported\r\nit as a migrant in the Pribilof Islands from early in May until June 13.\r\nProbably the main northward flight passes through the Kurile and\r\nCommander Islands to northeastern Siberia. Dr. E. W. Nelson (1887) says\r\nof its arrival in Alaska:\r\n\r\n     On May 26, 1877, while I was at Unalaska, a native brought in a\r\n     half dozen of these birds, and on June 3 I obtained three others\r\n     from the sandy beach of a small inner bay. They were very\r\n     unsuspicious and easily killed. Although these birds appeared to be\r\n     migrating, yet the following years I found them arriving at Saint\r\n     Michael in flocks of from 25 to 200 from the 13th to 20th of May.\r\n     These flocks were shy and kept in continual motion, wheeling and\r\n     circling in rapid flight over the lowland, now alighting for a\r\n     moment, then skimming away again in a close body. Their movements\r\n     and habits at this season are similar to those of other godwits. By\r\n     the last of May the flocks are broken up, and the birds are\r\n     distributed in small parties over their breeding ground.\r\nHerbert W. Brandt says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     For a large shore bird the dinful Pacific godwit is of common\r\n     occurrence on the vast mossy upland tundra about Hooper Bay and is\r\n     even more numerous in similar areas in the Igiak Bay region,\r\n     including the lower slopes of the mountain sides. The vociferous\r\n     guardian parents, however, make themselves so conspicuous by their\r\n     clamorous agitation that they seem more plentiful than they are in\r\n     reality. The first bird to arrive from afar, a beautiful ruddy\r\n     specimen, was captured May 15, and by May 20 occasional bands of 20\r\n     or more birds were feeding along the overflow river margins. These\r\n     flocks remained for some days and were apparently transients, for\r\n     they passed elsewhere. One flock of 21 highly colored birds stayed\r\n     with us until June. In the meanwhile the happy mated pairs had\r\n     already taken charge of their respective upland domains, for on May\r\n     25 a nest with two eggs was found, which on May 28 held four eggs.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Doctor Nelson (1887) gives a brief account of this, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Their courtship begins by the 18th or 20th of May and is carried on\r\n     in such a loud-voiced manner that every creature in the\r\n     neighborhood knows all about it. The males continually utter a loud\r\n     ringing _ku-wew, ku-wew, ku-wew_, which is repeated with great\r\n     emphasis upon the last syllable, and the note may be heard for\r\n     several hundred yards.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--We are indebted to Mr. Brandt for practically all we know\r\nabout the nesting habits of this rare species. I quote from his notes,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     The Pacific godwit chooses an elevated dry site for its domicile,\r\n     preferring the ridges on the rolling tundra and nests even occur on\r\n     the lower mountain slopes. The nest is well concealed, for it is\r\n     usually placed between clumps of bunch grass and is thus well\r\n     screened from view by the standing vegetation. The structure is\r\n     usually a simple depression in the moss and lichens and lined\r\n     haphazardly with fragments of the surrounding reindeer moss, but\r\n     occasionally a real nest is carefully fashioned with considerable\r\n     grass woven in a circular manner and is thus rather substantially\r\n     constructed. In one instance the bird added to the nesting material\r\n     while the eggs were being laid. The range of measurements of 12\r\n     nests is: Inside diameter, 6 to 7 inches; inside depth, 3 to 4\r\n     inches; and total depth, 3 to 5 inches. I observed the female\r\n     Pacific godwit alone to incubate, but the male was always near by.\r\n     She is perhaps the closest brooder of any incubating shore bird we\r\n     encountered, so much so that she often literally had to be almost\r\n     stepped on before she arose. The alert male lookout meets the\r\n     intruder at a considerable distance from the nest and with a loud\r\n     tongue acts as an escort to the discomfort of the interloper. Thus\r\n     but little clue can be had from the bird's actions as to the\r\n     whereabouts of the brooding female, and in consequence, in spite of\r\n     the number of nests in the region, relatively few are found, and\r\n     those mostly by chance. The peculiar contents of one nest were\r\n     originally five eggs of the willow ptarmigan, on top of which four\r\n     eggs of the Pacific godwit had been laid. Evidently the latter bird\r\n     had driven the ptarmigan away from its nest, as there were but\r\n     three godwit's eggs in it when first observed, the fourth egg\r\n     having been deposited on the following day. The entire nestful was\r\n     left to hatch in order to ascertain whether or not the ptarmigan\r\n     would be reared by the incubating godwit, but this composite set\r\n     was later deserted and then despoiled by jaegers.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Mr. Brandt was fortunate enough to collect 20 sets of eggs of\r\nthis rare species, which he describes in his notes as follows:\r\n\r\n     The egg of the Pacific godwit is subpyriform to ovate pyriform in\r\n     outline with the majority following the latter shape although one\r\n     set is elongate ovate. The shell is strong, smooth, slightly\r\n     granular with somewhat of a luster, yet an occasional surface is\r\n     almost dull. There are two general types of ground color--the\r\n     greenish, that is the rule, and the brownish type that we but\r\n     rarely encountered. \"Serpentine green,\" dull \"citrine\" to\r\n     \"yellowish glaucous\" cover the range of greenish ground colors,\r\n     while \"snuff brown\" matches the other type. The surface markings\r\n     are not as numerous as on most shorebirds' eggs, and in consequence\r\n     they are more scattered than usual. These spots are small in most\r\n     instances, but in a few beautiful sets they are large and, more\r\n     rarely, even convergent on the larger end so as to form a rich\r\n     blotch. In a few rare instances there were no surface markings at\r\n     all, the paler underlying spots being the only decoration. The\r\n     primary markings are irregular to elongated without a spiral\r\n     tendency. In color they are \"cinnamon brown,\" \"snuff brown,\" and\r\n     \"mummy brown\" or \"brownish olive,\" usually the latter if the ground\r\n     color is decidedly greenish. The underlying spots are not very\r\n     bold, although they are numerous and occasionally of considerable\r\n     size. These neutral spots range from \"light mouse gray\" or \"Quaker\r\n     drab\" to \"deep olive gray\" in color. Additional markings of grayish\r\n     black slightly fleck some eggs while they are wanting on others. In\r\n     a few cases these markings assume the form of pen scratches which\r\n     usually encircle the larger end. The eggs, which were the rarest\r\n     that we took on the trip, were always four in number, except for\r\n     one set of three and one nest of five eggs, the only abnormally\r\n     large set that I met with among the Alaska species of the entire\r\n     shore-bird group.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of his 80 eggs average 55.3 by 38.2 millimeters; the\r\neggs showing the four extremes measure =60.5= by 37.7, 52.6 by =40.7=,\r\n=50.5= by 38.2, and 54.8 by =36.1= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The same observer says:\r\n\r\n     Both birds share in the duties of incubation and are very zealous\r\n     in defense of their treasures, especially when their pretty tawny\r\n     brown chicks are first bursting forth. We saw the first downy young\r\n     on June 18 when we came upon two and one hatching egg at an\r\n     altitude of about 300 feet on the side of the Askinuk Mountains.\r\n     These sturdy babies have little to fear from their marine enemies\r\n     for their parents dominate the chosen domain with a vigor that no\r\n     feathered creature can withstand. It is very interesting to watch\r\n     the agitated father or mother running rapidly about, scolding, or\r\n     wading in a pool of snow water, every now and then raising its long\r\n     wings to a vertical position above its back, thus exhibiting the\r\n     delicate tints of the underside, and then deliberately folding them\r\n     one at a time.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The nestling Pacific godwit is warmly covered with long,\r\nthick, soft down, the prevailing colors of which are warm buff and\r\nsepia, in indistinct patterns; none of the markings are clearly\r\ndefined, as in the sandpipers, but are soft and blended. The large\r\ncircular crown patch is clear \"warm sepia,\" extending in a median stripe\r\ndown to the bill; there is a narrow loral stripe from the bill to the\r\neye and a broader one, though less distinct, from the eye to the\r\nocciput, both \"warm sepia\"; above these, broad stripes of grayish buff\r\nextend from the lores to the occiput, nearly encircling the dark crown,\r\nfrom which a median stripe of the sepia extends down the neck. The back,\r\nwings, and thighs are softly variegated with \"warm sepia,\" \"wood brown,\"\r\nand \"cinnamon buff.\" The under parts are largely \"pinkish buff,\"\r\nsuffused with \"cinnamon buff\" on the breast and fading out to nearly\r\nwhite on the chin. The down is all dusky or dark sepia at the base.\r\n\r\nIn fresh juvenal plumage, as seen in Alaska in August, the crown is\r\nstreaked with sepia, the feathers edged with light buff; the feathers of\r\nthe mantle, scapulars, tertials, and wing coverts are sepia or dusky,\r\nedged or notched with light buff; the rump and upper tail coverts are\r\nwhite, but much more heavily spotted with dusky than in the European\r\nform; the remiges are all conspicuously barred with dusky and light\r\nbuff; the buff edgings fade out almost to white later on; the under\r\nparts are dull buffy whitish, shaded on the chest with deeper grayish\r\nbuff. A postjuvenal molt begins in September, at which the body plumage\r\nis renewed, but not the remiges and few, if any, of the rectrices; most\r\nof the wing coverts are retained and some of the tertials. The resulting\r\nfirst winter plumage is like that of the adult except for the wings and\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nAt the first prenuptial molt the next spring the sexes begin to\r\ndifferentiate, the males being more richly colored with more cinnamon\r\nfeathers in the white under parts, and the females have the throat and\r\nbreast more or less streaked with sepia. This molt is incomplete and\r\nirregular, with much individual variation in the advance toward\r\nmaturity. Sometimes there is very little or no molt, the worn winter\r\nplumage being retained until summer; sometimes new winter feathers are\r\nacquired; but usually some or many of the body feathers, the tail, and\r\nsome tertials and wing coverts are molted and replaced with feathers\r\nlike the adult. The new tail feathers of the first nuptial plumage are\r\nplain gray, unbarred. Birds in this plumage are found on their breeding\r\ngrounds and probably breed at this age.\r\n\r\nAt the next molt, the first postnuptial, the adult winter plumage is\r\nassumed by a complete molt from July to December. Adults have a partial\r\nprenuptial molt, between February and May, which involves most of the\r\nbody plumage, usually the tail, some of the tertials, and some of the\r\nwing coverts; they also have a complete postnuptial molt beginning with\r\nthe body plumage in July or August. In the adult nuptial plumage the\r\ncentral pair of tail feathers are barred completely; the others are\r\nusually plain gray, but sometimes the outer pair or two are partially\r\nbarred.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Very little has been published on this subject. William Palmer\r\n(1899) says:\r\n\r\n     In the ponds they feed by keeping their bills in the water and move\r\n     invariably all in the same direction, heads to the wind. With care\r\n     I could approach within a few feet. Much the greater part of the\r\n     stomach contents of these birds consisted of hundreds of minute\r\n     threadlike aquatic larvae of a midge (_Chironomis_). Pieces of\r\n     mollusks' shell had been swallowed by several of the birds. Flies,\r\n     closely related to our common house fly, and tiger beetles were\r\n     detected in small quantities. Of the six godwits, five had been\r\n     killed on St. Paul Island, and had fed for the most part upon\r\n     midges, which were probably abundant in a fresh-water pond on the\r\n     island. The sixth bird was taken on Walrus Island. It had caught\r\n     over 500 specimens of a species of beetle (_Aegialites debilis_),\r\n     the sole representative of a unique family of beetles, described\r\n     some time ago and subsequently lost sight of until recently\r\n     discovered again.\r\n\r\nThe above report on stomach contents was made by Dr. S. D. Judd and has\r\nbeen amended by Preble and McAtee (1923), who report that the items of\r\nfood, ranked by bulk, are flies, 76.6 per cent; beetles, 17; mollusks,\r\n3.6; marine worms, 1.3; and vegetable matter, 1 per cent. The jaws of\r\nmarine worms (Nereidae) were mistaken for jaws of tiger beetles.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Doctor Nelson (1887) writes:\r\n\r\n     They frequent open grassy parts of the country and are quick to\r\n     protest against an invasion of their territory. As a person\r\n     approaches, one after the other of the birds arises and comes\r\n     circling about, uttering a loud _ku-wew_ with such energy as to\r\n     make the ears fairly ring. If their nests are near, or they have\r\n     young, they come closer and closer, some of the boldest swooping\r\n     close by one's head and redoubling the din. This same note is heard\r\n     upon all sides while the birds conduct their courtships, and it\r\n     serves also to express their anger and alarm. At the mating season\r\n     the males have a rolling whistle also like that of the ordinary\r\n     field plover, but shorter. When the birds fly at this time they\r\n     hold the wings decurved and stiffened and make a few rapid strokes,\r\n     then glide for a short distance. On the ground it walks gracefully,\r\n     its head well raised, and frequently pauses to raise its wings high\r\n     over the back and then deliberately folds them. They may be decoyed\r\n     when flying in flocks if their whistling note be imitated. If\r\n     wounded and taken in hand, they utter a loud, harsh scream.\r\n\r\nMr. Brandt says in his notes:\r\n     The Pacific godwit has wonderful powers of flight, and, as it\r\n     wheels about protesting against an intrusion, the slightest beat of\r\n     its long, decurved wings seems, without perceptible effort, to\r\n     drive it forward like an arrow from the bow. That its power of\r\n     flight is extraordinary is shown by the fact that it spends the\r\n     winter time of the north in southern Australia and New Zealand. It\r\n     migrates along the eastern coast of Asia and is one of the\r\n     interesting Old World birds that find their northeastern limit on\r\n     the Alaskan shores of Bering Sea. During the love-making period,\r\n     shortly after this godwit's arrival on May 15, it could be heard\r\n     for an hour at a time high up in the air, as it circled about,\r\n     uttering continuously its wild far-reaching cry, which was very\r\n     distinctive among the medley of voices. The call of the male is\r\n     often answered by the female with the syllables, _tut-tut_, not\r\n     unlike a clucking chicken. The Pacific godwit differed from the\r\n     other shore birds nesting at Hooper Bay in that individuals in\r\n     immature plumage were breeding. Sometimes a gray-breasted immature\r\n     female would be paired with a rich plumaged male, or again both\r\n     mates would be in full color; but I encountered many pairs in which\r\n     both parents showed the light grayish breast of adolescence. In\r\n     fact, the immatures seemed to be in the majority. It is believed\r\n     that this godwit does not assume its fully adult feathers until the\r\n     beginning of the third year; but, like the bald eagle, it breeds\r\n     during the second year. The earliest spring arrivals at Hooper Bay\r\n     were immatures and they seemed to migrate in separate flocks. One\r\n     group of about 20 richly cinnamon-breasted adults stayed in our\r\n     vicinity for several days from May 20 onward. Perhaps they were\r\n     resting and feeding in preparation for the final stage of their\r\n     journey to more polar lands for they, as well as all the other\r\n     large flocks of godwits no doubt passed on to the north. The birds\r\n     that nested in the Hooper Bay region arrived in an inconspicuous\r\n     manner, simply filtering into their chosen haunts and were already\r\n     mated.\r\n\r\n_Field-marks._--The Pacific godwit can be easily distinguished in the\r\nfield from either of our two other American godwits. The marbled godwit\r\nhas much more rufous in the upper parts, particularly in the wings, and\r\nhas no white on the rump. The Hudsonian is very dark on the upper parts,\r\nalmost black on the wings; it has a pure white rump and a black tail.\r\nThe Pacific is dull brown above, with no rufous; it has a white rump,\r\nspotted with dusky, and a tail barred with dark gray and white.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Doctor Nelson (1887) says:\r\n\r\n     These godwits are among the first of the waders to leave Alaska in\r\n     fall. The young are flying by the middle of July and before the end\r\n     of August not one of these birds, young or old, is to be found.\r\n\r\nYoung birds apparently wander northward and eastward before they start\r\non their southward migration, for they have been taken in August at\r\nWainwright and at Point Barrow in company with young dowitchers and\r\nred-backed sandpipers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Alaska and eastern Asia south to Australia, New Zealand, and\r\nthe Samoan Islands.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The Pacific godwit breeds from northeastern Siberia\r\n(Taimyr Peninsula, Marcova, and Nijni Kolymsk); east to western Alaska\r\n(Unalaska Island, Hooper Bay, Kotlik, Pastolik, Cape Prince of Wales,\r\nCape Blossom, and Kowak River).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The Malay Archipelago, Samoan and Fiji Islands, New\r\nZealand, and Australia, and probably other islands of Oceanica.\r\n\r\n_Migration._--The migration route of this species is almost entirely in\r\nthe Eastern Hemisphere, through the Commander Islands, Japan, China,\r\nand the Philippines. They have been observed to arrive in Siberia on May\r\n10 (Bering Island) and May 30 (Nijni Kolymsk) and in Alaska on May 15\r\n(Hooper Bay), May 20 (St. Paul Island), and May 29 (Unalaska). After the\r\nbreeding season, individuals have been known to wander north to the\r\nColville delta and Point Barrow. The latest date of fall departure noted\r\nfor Point Barrow is August 18 and for St. Michael September 10.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--One specimen obtained at La Paz, Lower California\r\n(Belding), and recorded as this species is now regarded as a marbled\r\ngodwit, and there is one record from the island of Kauai, and several\r\nfrom Laysan, Hawaiian Islands (Bryan). A specimen taken on Cape Cod,\r\nMassachusetts, on September 16, 1907, is referable to the European form\r\n_Limosa lapponica lapponica_.\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Alaska: 15 records, May 25 to July 9; 8 records, May 29 to\r\nJune 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMOSA HAEMASTICA (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\nHUDSONIAN GODWIT\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nI can count on the fingers of one hand the red-letter days when I have\r\nbeen privileged to see this rare and handsome wader. It has always been\r\namong the great desiderata of bird collectors. Its eggs are exceedingly\r\nrare in collections. Many ornithologists have never seen it in life. I\r\ncan find no evidence that it was ever common. All the earlier writers\r\nreported it as uncommon or rare. Audubon (1840) referred to it as \"of\r\nrare occurrence in any part of the United States.\" He never saw it in\r\nlife and handled only a few market specimens in the flesh.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--From its winter home in far southern South America the\r\nHudsonian godwit migrates in spring by some unknown route to the coast\r\nof Texas, where it arrives in April. I saw three adults and collected a\r\npair in fine spring plumage near Aransas Pass on May 17, 1923. From\r\nTexas and Louisiana it migrates northward through the Mississippi\r\nValley, central Canada and the Mackenzie Valley to the Arctic coast.\r\nProf. William Rowan in his notes refers to it as a scarce, but regular,\r\nspring migrant in Alberta; his dates are between April 29 and May 29. He\r\nand C. G. Harrold (1923) recorded 24 birds between these dates in 1923.\r\nTheir records are as follows:\r\n\r\n     April 29, 2 flocks of 6 each (also 2 avocets on this date, although\r\n     on the 30th it snowed all day); May 7, 2 Hudsonians at the lake and\r\n     one with a party of marbled godwits at a muddy slough a few miles\r\n     away; May 8, a flock of 4 Hudsonian and 2 marbled; May 15, flock of\r\n     3 Hudsonian, 2 marbled, and 1 Willet; May 22, a fine male Hudsonian\r\n     with 8 or 9 marbled. One other specimen was seen flying over about\r\n     May 10.\r\n\r\nAt Whitewater Lake, in Manitoba, Mr. Harrold noted one each day on May\r\n10 and 11, 1924, and 12 at the same place in 1925, practically all\r\nbetween May 13 and 20. I saw one at Lake Winnipegosis on June 5, 1913, a\r\nlate date. On the Atlantic coast it is known only as a rare straggler in\r\nthe spring and it is practically unknown on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Practically all of what little we know of the nesting habits\r\nof the Hudsonian godwit is contained in Roderick MacFarlane's notes. A\r\nfemale and four eggs were taken near Fort Anderson on June 9, 1862, from\r\na nest on the ground made of a \"few decayed leaves lying in a small hole\r\nscooped in the earth.\" Another nest on the Lower Anderson was \"on the\r\nborders of a small lake\" and was made of \"a few withered leaves placed\r\nin a hole or depression in the ground.\"\r\n\r\nA set of four eggs, in the Thayer collection, was collected by Bishop J.\r\nO. Stringer at Mackenzie Bay, June 30, 1897, from \"a nest situated in a\r\nhollow in the grass.\" Edward Arnold also has a set of four eggs, taken\r\nby Bishop Stringer in the same locality on June 29, 1899; the nest was\r\n\"in a tuft of grass on an island in Mackenzie Bay.\"\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The Hudsonian godwit probably lays four eggs normally, though\r\nthere are sets of three in collections. What few eggs I have seen, not\r\nover a baker's dozen, are ovate pyriform in shape and have little or no\r\ngloss. The ground colors vary from \"dark olive buff\" to \"olive buff,\" or\r\nfrom \"light brownish olive\" to \"ecrue olive.\" They are usually sparingly\r\nmarked with rather obscure spots, irregularly distributed, but generally\r\nmostly around the larger end, in darker shades of similar colors, such\r\nas \"buffy olive,\" \"light brownish olive,\" \"buffy brown,\" \"bister,\" or\r\n\"sepia.\" There are usually underlying spots of \"hair brown\" or shades of\r\n\"drab,\" and some eggs have a few black dots at the larger end.\r\n\r\nA set in the United States National Museum is thus described for me by\r\nJ. H. Riley:\r\n\r\n     No two eggs in this set are alike. They vary in ground color from a\r\n     little darker than \"citrine drab,\" through \"light brownish olive,\"\r\n     to \"dark olive buff.\" The darkest egg has a zone of \"olive brown\"\r\n     spots at the larger end, with a few \"clove brown\" dots here and\r\n     there, and a few scattered spots and blotches of \"olive brown\" over\r\n     the rest of the egg. The next darkest egg is similar, but with the\r\n     contrast between the ground color and the \"olive brown\" zone more\r\n     pronounced and an increase in size and number of the \"clove brown\"\r\n     spots. The lightest (\"dark olive buff\" ground) egg has a solid cap\r\n     of \"clove brown\" at the larger end and quite numerous blotches,\r\n     scrawls, and spots of \"clove brown\" and \"olive brown,\" with a few\r\n     shell markings of \"drab\" over the rest of the surface.\r\n\r\nSome of the eggs I have seen are much like well-marked eggs of the\r\nblack-tailed godwit. The measurements of 27 eggs average 55.2 by 38.1\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =60.6= by 39.6,\r\n56 by =41.2=, and =51= by =35= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--I have never seen a downy young Hudsonian godwit nor any\r\nvery young juvenals. The sexes are alike in the juvenal plumage and\r\nprobably all through the first year. The plumages are alike in winter\r\nbut the females are somewhat larger. A young female in juvenal plumage,\r\ntaken in Maine in September, is similar to the winter adult, except that\r\nthe crown is more streaked with dusky; the feathers of the mantle are\r\n\"sepia,\" edged with \"pinkish cinnamon\"; the scapulars and tertials are\r\nedged, notched, or barred with \"cinnamon,\" and the tail is tipped with\r\nbuffy white. I have seen birds in this plumage up to October 13; but\r\nusually the partial postjuvenal molt of the body plumage and probably\r\nsome of the scapulars and tertials begins in October. Material is\r\nlacking to illustrate the first prenuptial molt, which takes place in\r\nSouth America. Probably this molt is very limited in young birds. A\r\nfemale, taken on May 28 in Wisconsin, probably in first nuptial plumage,\r\nshows a mixture of fresh adult nuptial body feathers both above and\r\nbelow, and fresh tail feathers, but the primaries are worn. Probably at\r\nthe next molt, the first postnuptial, which is complete, the adult\r\nwinter plumage is assumed.\r\n\r\nAdults have an extensive prenuptial molt, involving everything but the\r\nwings and perhaps the tail. This is accomplished during the late winter\r\nor early spring before the birds migrate. Dr. Alexander Wetmore (1926)\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     A male shot March 7 is in full winter plumage with worn primaries\r\n     but newly grown tail feathers and lesser wing-coverts. Two females\r\n     shot March 8 have renewed the flight feathers and tail and have the\r\n     breeding plumage growing rapidly on the body.\r\n\r\nThe postnuptial molt is complete; the body molt begins in July and is\r\nwell advanced towards completion when the birds reach our shores in\r\nAugust or September; the wings are apparently molted later, after the\r\nbirds reach their winter homes in South America. There is a striking\r\ndifference between the richly colored nuptial plumage and the dull and\r\nsomber winter plumage, with the brownish gray upper parts and the pale\r\ngrayish buff under parts.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, all the recent manuals that I have seen state or imply\r\nthat the sexes are alike in nuptial plumage; and this in spite of the\r\nfact that many years ago Swainson and Richardson (1831) called attention\r\nto the striking difference between the two sexes, which are decidedly\r\nunlike. In the male the underparts are deep, rich brown, \"Mikado brown\"\r\nor \"Kaiser brown,\" with much individual variation in the amount of black\r\ntransverse barring, which is sometimes almost entirely lacking in the\r\ncenter of the breast. In the female, which is always somewhat larger,\r\nthe under parts are barred with white, dusky, and brown; the feathers\r\nof the flanks are brown with three or four black or dusky bars and broad\r\nwhite tips; on the breast only the outer half of the feather is brown,\r\nthe remainder is white, with two or three dusky bars and a broad white\r\ntip. Careless sexing may have caused the oft-repeated error.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Edward H. Forbush (1925) says that \"the food of the Hudsonian\r\ngodwit includes worms, many insects (including horseflies and\r\nmosquitoes), mollusks and crustaceans, and various small forms of marine\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--He also says:\r\n\r\n     While with us it seems to have a preference for sandy shores and\r\n     sand spits, but it also frequents mud flats, beaches, and creeks in\r\n     the salt marsh, and sometimes goes to the uplands after insects.\r\n\r\nDr. L. C. Sanford (1903), writing of the habits of the Hudsonian godwit\r\nin the Magdalen Islands, says:\r\n\r\n     On the islands where these birds congregate they frequent the large\r\n     open lagoons where the low tide leaves exposed miles of sand bars.\r\n     Here they follow the water's edge and wade in up to the full length\r\n     of their long legs, feeding on animalculae and small larvae, for\r\n     which their bill is peculiarly adapted, having the same flexible\r\n     tip as that of the Wilson's snipe. With the rising water, first the\r\n     small sandpipers, then the larger birds are driven from the flats;\r\n     last of all, the godwit. They start in flocks of from 10 to 20 and\r\n     keep well in the center of the lagoon, flying over the flooded\r\n     flats, avoiding carefully all land, even the farthest points and\r\n     islands.\r\n\r\n     The long black lines of birds undulating in their flight can\r\n     readily be distinguished from any other shore bird. They have a\r\n     very dark appearance. In a short half hour the last flocks have\r\n     passed and there is no further flight until the next tide. At high\r\n     water they congregate on the upper beaches, well out of reach of\r\n     any disturber. For a long time it was impossible to arrange a\r\n     blind in the range of the flight, but finally by piling up heaps\r\n     of seaweed and staking them down far out in the shallow water, we\r\n     managed to kill a small number. They quickly learned the danger,\r\n     however, and would keep on their course just out of reach.\r\n\r\nDr. D. G. Elliot (1895) writes:\r\n\r\n     Like the other godwit, its larger relative, it is a shy bird during\r\n     migration and keeps a watchful eye on an intruder in its domain,\r\n     rising at a considerable distance and uttering its shrill cry. It\r\n     sometimes decoys readily, setting its wings and sailing up to the\r\n     wooden counterfeits, lured on by a close imitation of its note, but\r\n     soon discovers the deception and either alights only for a moment\r\n     or else wheels about over the decoys, and hastily departs, provided\r\n     it escapes the rain of shot from the discharged gun of the\r\n     concealed sportsman. About Hudson's Bay it is met with in large\r\n     flocks, resorting to the beach when the tide is low, and feeding on\r\n     the crustacea it discovers there, retiring to the marshes as the\r\n     tide rises.\r\n\r\nProfessor Rowan writes to me:\r\n\r\n     Like the majority of waders, this godwit can swim with ease and has\r\n     been observed swimming of its own accord when crossing from one\r\n     sand ridge to another, and also when dropped into deep water after\r\n     being shot in flight but not killed.\r\n\r\n     The flight of the species is distinctly \"ploverish.\" The greater\r\n     contrast, against its white parts, of its darker balance makes it\r\n     distinguishable at considerable distance from the willet when in\r\n     flight. They can easily be mistaken for each other if casually\r\n     observed, especially in the grey plumage of young and fall adults.\r\n\r\n     In walking this godwit has much the same attitudes of the marbled,\r\n     generally very ungraceful and altogether hunched up, neck closely\r\n     drawn into the body. It is, however, altogether warier than the\r\n     marbled and carries its neck stretched out more frequently.\r\n\r\n     On the whole it is an extremely silent species. I have seen dozens\r\n     of birds but have only heard a call twice. This sounded like\r\n     _ta-it_ on both occasions, less raucous than the marbles call but\r\n     in general quite reminiscent of it.\r\n\r\nDoctor Wetmore (1926) says:\r\n\r\n     In plain gray winter plumage this godwit is as inconspicuous and\r\n     nondescript in appearance as a willet. In general size it suggests\r\n     a greater yellow-legs, but can be distinguished at any distance by\r\n     its quiet carriage, for it does not practice the constant tilting\r\n     that is the habit of the yellow-legs. These godwits sought company\r\n     with scattered flocks of stilts or smaller shore birds, and in\r\n     feeding walked rapidly, at times in water nearly to their bodies or\r\n     again in the shallows. As they moved they probed rapidly and\r\n     constantly in the mud with a nervous thrusting motion, often with\r\n     the beak immersed clear to their eyes. Morsels of food that were\r\n     encountered were passed rapidly up the length of the bill and\r\n     swallowed. When their movements carried them too near the stilts\r\n     the latter hustled them about, and made them run rapidly to escape\r\n     their bills, but in spite of this discouragement the godwits\r\n     remained in as close proximity as permitted to their belligerent\r\n     neighbors, perhaps, because of similarity in feeding habit. Some\r\n     Hudsonian godwit gave a low chattering call when flushed, a low\r\n     _qua qua_ that resembled one of the notes of _L. fedoa_. As they\r\n     extend the wings to fly the dark axillars show as a patch of black\r\n     and in flight the white tail, with black band across the tip is\r\n     prominent. The birds are hunted to such an extent that they are\r\n     exceedingly wary. When opportunity offered I took only a few for\r\n     specimens.\r\n\r\nReferring to their habits in Alberta, C. G. Harrold (1923) says:\r\n\r\n     The individuals in the parties seen on April 29 were feeding very\r\n     close together like dowitchers. Not a single bird was seen on dry\r\n     land and most of them were wading about in water 4 inches to 6\r\n     inches deep, one bird swimming after the manner of a yellow-legs\r\n     which has waded out of its depth. Although the Hudsonian godwits\r\n     associate with the marbled, the latter bully them considerably,\r\n     chasing them away if they approach the marbled too closely when\r\n     feeding.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Mr. Harrold (1923) says that \"their call note is a soft _chip_\r\n(very unlike the harsh notes of the vociferous marbled), and when\r\nalarmed they utter a low sandpiper-like chattering.\" They are usually\r\nvery silent birds.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--In spring plumage the Hudsonian godwit can be recognized\r\neasily at almost any distance by the rich brown underparts, almost black\r\nupper parts, white rump, and black tail; at a long distance it looks\r\nvery black. On the wing in all plumages the white rump and black tail\r\nare conspicuous and the wings are diagnostic; the axillars are jet\r\nblack and the lining of the wing is black; the wings are nearly black,\r\nwith a small, central white patch, much smaller than that of the willet.\r\nAn immature bird while standing, might be mistaken for a willet, but it\r\nis a much slenderer bird and has a longer, slenderer bill.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Hudsonian godwits gather in flocks on the western shores of\r\nHudson Bay, preparing for their eastward migration to the Atlantic\r\ncoasts of the Maritime Provinces and New England. The normal migration\r\nroute is probably over the ocean from Nova Scotia to British Guiana or\r\nBrazil, the birds being seen in New England and Long Island only when\r\ndriven in by severe storms.\r\n\r\nE. A. Preble (1902) saw a number on the beach about 50 miles north of\r\nYork Factory as early as July 19, and it was last seen by him below Cape\r\nChurchill on August 24, 1900. This was the beginning of the eastward\r\nmigration from Hudson Bay. The species is practically unknown in the\r\ninterior of southern Canada in the fall.\r\n\r\nDoctor Sanford (1903) writes:\r\n\r\n     I have seen these birds on some of the islands in the Gulf of St.\r\n     Lawrence in large flocks. They arrive late in July, the first\r\n     comers being steadily augmented by new arrivals until by the first\r\n     week of August their greatest abundance has been reached. From this\r\n     time on the numbers rapidly decrease, and by the last of the month\r\n     only odd birds are seen. The young appear about the middle of\r\n     September, and until October 1 are common in the same locations. On\r\n     the adjacent mainland and the shores farther south the birds are\r\n     seldom met with, and then only as odd stragglers. Where they stop\r\n     next and what their course is on departing is a mystery. Probably\r\n     they keep well out to the open sea, and along with the golden\r\n     plover wisely skip the United States in the fall flight south.\r\n\r\nAs indicated above, Hudsonian godwits evidently pass by New England far\r\nout at sea in fair weather, as they are strong, swift fliers, capable of\r\na long, continuous flight. But during heavy easterly storms they are\r\noccasionally driven in and onto our coasts. The first one I shot was one\r\nof four birds taken on Monomoy Island, Massachusetts, September 5, 1892,\r\nafter a severe northeast storm, which lasted for two days and brought in\r\na heavy flight of shore birds. This was an adult. I have two other\r\nbirds, both young birds, taken on Cape Cod on October 2 and 4. Mr.\r\nForbush (1912) reports \"a flock of about 50 birds seen at Ipswich on\r\nAugust 26, 1908, of which several were killed.\" He also says:\r\n\r\n     On August 13, 1903, a large flight occurred on the Long Island\r\n     coast and many were killed, but little was heard of them to the\r\n     southward. The only flight of godwits that is shown on the record\r\n     of Chatham Beach Hotel for seven years is in August, 1903. No birds\r\n     were taken on the 13th, when the great flight appeared on Long\r\n     Island, for at Chatham the weather apparently was fair, with a west\r\n     wind. One bird, perhaps a straggler from the Long Island flight,\r\n     was picked up on the 20th after a southeast wind had blown for two\r\n     days. On the 26th a northeast wind set in, and it blew from the\r\n     east or northeast for six days. On the 29th seven godwits were\r\n     killed. During the seven years for which the record was kept\r\n     godwits were taken only singly or in pairs, with the above\r\n     exception, and the record shows 42 killed all told. Twenty-four\r\n     were taken during east, north, or northeast winds; eight in\r\n     northwest winds; six in southwest winds; two in west winds; and\r\n     only one in a south wind.\r\n\r\nMr. S. Prescott Fay (1911) reports an unusually heavy flight at Cape Cod\r\nfrom early in August until October 22, 1910, during which 25 birds were\r\nshot on 17 different dates. He saw a flock of 10 on August 15, but says:\r\n\r\n     In most cases they were lone birds and, contrary to their habits,\r\n     were tame and decoyed readily. However, on September 5, during a\r\n     heavy easterly storm with a downpour of rain, a flock of 30 to 35\r\n     birds went over our stand at Chatham. Instead of alighting, as we\r\n     supposed they would do, for they appeared very much exhausted, they\r\n     continued their slow flight and disappeared, going due south in the\r\n     heaviest part of the storm. However, a man a short way below us\r\n     shot three of these birds as we watched them go over him high up,\r\n     and later we found some one else above us had shot one from the\r\n     same flock only a minute or two earlier. One of these men estimated\r\n     that the flock contained over 40 birds, so my figures may be too\r\n     low or else, after he fired, the birds may have separated so that\r\n     we might have seen only part of the original flock.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--The winter home of the Hudsonian godwit is in extreme\r\nsouthern South America, from Argentina and Chile south to the Straits of\r\nMagellan and the Falkland Islands.\r\n\r\nA. H. Holland (1892) says that, in Argentina, it \"appears in flocks late\r\nin the winter after heavy rains from July to August. They were met with\r\nboth in summer and winter plumage.\" Ernest Gibson (1920) reported it as\r\nformerly \"very abundant, in numerous flocks, some of apparently over\r\n1,000,\" in the Province of Buenos Aires. He says that--\r\n\r\n     On more than one of these occasions several birds have dropped to\r\n     my gun. The flock would then again and again sweep round and hover\r\n     over the individuals in the water, uttering loud cries of distress,\r\n     quite regardless of my presence in the open and the renewed\r\n     gunfire. Though the godwit is such an excellent table bird, I found\r\n     myself unable to continue the slaughter under these circumstances.\r\n     I might select my birds, but so closely were they packed together\r\n     that the shots went practically \"into the brown,\" and caused\r\n     innumerable cripples.\r\n\r\nConditions have changed since then, for Doctor Wetmore (1926) writes:\r\n\r\n     Save for a record to be mentioned later, the Hudsonian godwit was\r\n     first recorded on November 13, 1920, when four, in winter plumage,\r\n     were found with small sandpipers on the tidal flats near the mouth\r\n     of the Rio Ajo, below Lavalle, Buenos Aires. Two more were seen\r\n     here on November 15. The species was not noted again until March 3,\r\n     1921, when two were seen along the Laguna del Morte in the\r\n     outskirts of Guamini, Buenos Aires. Four more were found on March\r\n     4, one in brown dress and the others still in winter plumage. On\r\n     March 5 eight were recorded, one only showing distinct signs of\r\n     breeding plumage. On the day following three passed swiftly\r\n     northward over the lake without pausing to alight, while on March 7\r\n     eight were seen together and a single bird later, and by a lucky\r\n     shot I secured one, a male. March 8, 12 that fed in a small bay\r\n     were so slow in rising that I secured 3. At dusk 12 more came to\r\n     roost on a mud bar in company with golden plover. Though reported\r\n     50 years ago as found in great bands and among the most abundant of\r\n     shore birds in this region, the small number that I have recorded\r\n     here are all that were observed in continued field work throughout\r\n     the winter range of the species. I was fortunate in seeing these,\r\n     as by chance I found a spot where they tarried in northward\r\n     migration from some point to the south.\r\n\r\nThe passing of this fine bird must be a cause for regret among sportsmen\r\nand nature lovers alike, to be attributed to the greed of gunners and to\r\nthe fact that its large size and gregarious habit made it desirable to\r\nsecure and when opportunity offered easy to kill in large numbers. There\r\nis little hope even under the most rigorous protection that the species\r\ncan regain its former numbers. It would appear that the small number\r\nthat remain winter mainly in Patagonia, as the species was encountered\r\nin any number only when in migration from that region.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North America, chiefly east of the Rocky Mountains to southern\r\nSouth America. Now almost extinct.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The only eggs of this species that have been\r\ncollected were taken at Mackenzie Bay and on the Anderson River,\r\nMackenzie. It has been reported in summer from Alaska (Kenai, Nulato,\r\nUgashik, mouth of the Yukon River, and Point Barrow); east to Prince\r\nEdward Island and the Magdalen Islands (Audubon); but in no case, save\r\nthe one above mentioned, is there satisfactory evidence of breeding.\r\nPreble found it common on the Barren Grounds south of Cape Eskimo,\r\nduring the early part of August, and it also was noted by him in the\r\ncountry north of York Factory, in the middle of July.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The Hudsonian godwit appears to winter only in southern\r\nSouth America. It has been taken or observed at this season in the\r\nFalkland Islands (Mare Harbor); Argentina (Chubut Valley, Lavalle, Azul,\r\nBuenos Aires, and La Plata); and Chile (Straits of Magellan, Ancud, and\r\nValparaiso). MacFarlane (1887) reported them as abundant on the coast of\r\nPeru (San Juan) on November 9, 1883, but it seems unlikely that they\r\nwere preparing to winter in that latitude.\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--This species always has been apparently rare on the\r\nAtlantic coast in spring and but few records are available. Among these\r\nare Maryland, West River, May 6, 1886 (only record for the State);\r\nDelaware, Rehoboth, May 8, 1906; and New York, Long Beach, May 23,\r\n1925. Records of spring arrival for the interior are not much more\r\nnumerous but among these are: Louisiana, Vinton, April 22; Missouri,\r\nApril 19; Illinois, Albany, April 22; Ohio, New Bremen, April 22, and\r\nYoungstown, April 26; Michigan, Detroit, May 14; Ontario, Point Pelee,\r\nMay 13; Iowa, Blue Lake, May 7; Minnesota, Heron Lake, April 19, and\r\nGrant County, April 25; Kansas, Lawrence, April 19; Nebraska, Lincoln,\r\nMay 10; South Dakota, Vermilion, May 8; North Dakota, Harrisburg, May 6;\r\nSaskatchewan, Indian Head, May 11; Montana, Terry, May 10; Alberta,\r\nBeaverhill Lake, April 28; Mackenzie, Fort Anderson, June 7; and Alaska,\r\nFort Kenai, May 5, Valdez, May 10, Lynn Canal, May 12, and St. Michael,\r\nMay 22.\r\n\r\nLate dates of spring departure are: Ontario, Toronto, June 13; Iowa,\r\nSioux City, May 17; Wisconsin, Albion, June 3; Minnesota, Grant County,\r\nMay 15, Hallock, May 17, Hallock, May 18, and Mankato, May 25; Nebraska,\r\nLincoln, May 22, and Ceresco, June 12; South Dakota, Vermilion, May 24;\r\nNorth Dakota, Charlson, May 22; and Manitoba, Shoal Lake, May 29, and\r\nLake Winnipegosis, June 5.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--Early dates of arrival in the fall are: Keewatin,\r\nYork Factory, July 19; Manitoba, Big Stick Lake, July 21; South Dakota,\r\nArtesian, July 10; Iowa, Sioux City, August 12; Ontario, Rupert House,\r\nJuly 30, and Toronto, August 20; Ohio, Pelee Island, August 24;\r\nIllinois, Mount Carmel, August 29, and Aledo, September 9; Louisiana,\r\nNew Orleans, September 27; Rhode Island, Newport, July 29; New York,\r\nShinnecock, August 8, Mastic, August 21, South Oyster Bay, August 25,\r\nand Quogue, August 31; New Jersey, Anglesea, August 26; North Carolina,\r\nPea Island, September 13, 1911 (only record for the State); and West\r\nIndies, Barbados, October 5, and Dominica, October 8.\r\n\r\nLate dates of fall departures are: Keewatin, Cape Eskimo, August 14, and\r\nFort Churchill, August 24; Minnesota, St. Vincent, September 15;\r\nWisconsin, Racine, November 1; Ontario, Ottawa, October 11, and Toronto,\r\nOctober 20; Quebec, Montreal, October 11; Massachusetts, Monomoy Island,\r\nOctober 2, Ipswich, October 20, and Eastham, November 3; Connecticut,\r\nLittle River marshes, October 11, and Lyme, October 30; Rhode Island,\r\nNewport, October 13; and New York, Onondaga Lake, October 13,\r\nBranchport, October 29, and Ithaca, November 5.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--A specimen of the Hudsonian godwit was taken near St.\r\nGeorge, Bermuda, in the fall of 1875.\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Arctic Canada: 8 records, June 9 to 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMOSA LIMOSA LIMOSA (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\nBLACK-TAILED GODWIT\r\n\r\n_Contributed by Francis Charles Robert Jourdain_\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThe only claim this species has to a place in the North American fauna\r\nrests upon its accidental occurrence in Greenland, where it is said to\r\nhave occurred twice. There is, however, an element of doubt about the\r\nrecords. The first is due to Fabricius, who states in his _Fauna\r\nGreenlandica_ that he had seen a single specimen; the next occurrence is\r\nsaid to have taken place near Godthaab, or if Holböll's reference is to\r\nthe same specimen, at the Kok Islands near Godthaab, and was recorded by\r\nReinhardt, senior, in 1824. The skin was sent to the Museum at\r\nCopenhagen, but Dr. J. Reinhardt, junior, was unable to find it there,\r\nas he states in the _Ibis_ 1861, page 11. Winge pertinently suggests\r\nthat there may have been some confusion with _Limosa haemastica_, of\r\nwhich species several specimens were sent to Copenhagen from Greenland,\r\nincluding one from Godthaab, sent by Holböll. The distance from Iceland\r\nto Greenland is not very great, but one would expect stragglers from\r\nthat direction to arrive on the east side of Greenland instead of on the\r\nwest side, where the great majority of accidental visitors are of\r\nNearctic origin.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--Fortunately we are now in possession of fairly full and\r\ncomplete descriptions of the courtship activities of this species on the\r\narrival at its breeding grounds in Holland (Huxley and Montague 1926).\r\nHere it appears during the last days of March; in 1925 the first arrival\r\ntook place on March 25, but up to March 31 a large proportion of the\r\nbreeding stock had not yet put in an appearance. It is, however,\r\ninteresting to note that many of the birds were not only on their\r\nbreeding territories, but were obviously in pairs, although some unmated\r\nbirds were also present and small flocks of newly arrived birds were\r\nalso met with. Evidently the males do not migrate in advance of the\r\nfemales in order to \"stake out their claims,\" as is the case with\r\ncertain other species.\r\n\r\nIn the British Isles, where the black-tailed godwit has long ceased to\r\nbreed, it is now only an irregular passage migrant chiefly from mid\r\nApril to mid June, in small numbers along the south and southeast\r\ncoasts. The Iceland breeding birds, however, pass through Ireland on\r\ntheir way north and reach their destination during the latter half of\r\nApril or early in May in small flocks, but in these northern latitudes\r\nthe breeding season is naturally later than in Central Europe and the\r\neggs are not laid till late in May.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--This is dealt with by Huxley and Montague (1926) in\r\nconsiderable detail and is divided into seven sections: (1) The\r\nceremonial flight and its variations, (2) the joint flight, (3) the\r\ntail display, (4) the scrape ceremony, (5) the pursuit, (6) fighting,\r\nand (7) coition. Taking these consecutively, the ceremonial flight is\r\nmuch the commonest and most striking action during the courtship period\r\nand is confined to the male alone. He rises at a steep angle with\r\nquickly beating wings, uttering repeatedly a loud trisyllabic call,\r\n_tur-ee-tur_. When a height of some 150 or 200 feet has been gained the\r\nreal ceremonial flight starts. The most obvious point about it is the\r\nchange of call--the quick trisyllable is suddenly replaced by a\r\nlower-toned disyllable, which may be represented by the letter _ghrutoe_\r\n(or _grutto_, the Dutch name for godwit).\r\n\r\n     This change was inevitable; on no single occasion did we hear it in\r\n     any way departed from. The change in flight is equally notable. The\r\n     quick beat of the wings is suddenly slowed and is replaced by a\r\n     succession of slow, clipping strokes; at the same time the wings\r\n     are markedly bent downward just as those of the redshank in some of\r\n     his courtship flights. The tail is spread to the full and is\r\n     twisted round, first to one side and then to the other.\r\n     Simultaneously the whole body is tilted over in the same direction\r\n     as the tail and the bird flaps along with slow wing beats and body\r\n     heeled over for 20 or 30 yards. Then the tail is screwed over\r\n     toward the other side, and the body heels over correspondingly.\r\n     Thus the performing bird flies along rolling from side to side and\r\n     repeating the _grutto_ call continuously. We are, on the whole,\r\n     inclined to attribute it to the rudder action of the tail.\r\n\r\nThe flight generally takes place within a circle of 150 to 300 yards in\r\ndiameter and about 200 feet up, but both direction and duration are\r\nvariable and Huxley has seen one bird \"rolling\" for over a mile in a\r\nstraight line, while another has come down after a dozen wing strokes.\r\nThe descent is even more striking; the rolling flight and call stop\r\nsimultaneously and the bird glides with rigid wings suddenly nose-diving\r\ndownwards with almost closed wings till about 50 feet from the ground\r\nwhen the wings are opened and the godwit sideslips in all directions.\r\nJust before alighting the wings are opened and held vertically for a\r\nsecond or two afterwards. Another method, occasionally used, is to\r\ndescend with the wings about two-thirds open, causing a loud roaring\r\nnoise due to the wind passing through the separated primaries, and in\r\nthis case the bird alights directly with spread wings and tail.\r\n\r\nThe \"joint flight\" is shared by both sexes and is normal in character,\r\nboth birds (but especially the male) calling quickly as when rising for\r\nthe ceremonial flight. The female is generally slightly in front of the\r\nmale on these occasions. During the \"tail display\" the male struts round\r\nthe hen with the tail fully expanded like a fan, but depressed to about\r\nan angle of 60° to 70° with the horizontal and tilts it from side to\r\nside so that the black and white surface is presented to the female. The\r\n\"scrape ceremony\" is chiefly confined to the male who runs to a\r\ndepression and crouches down in it with slightly open wings, tail\r\ncoverts puffed out and compressed tail pointing upwards, while he\r\npresses his breast against the ground as if smoothing off a scrape.\r\nFemales were noticed to go through this action with appreciably spread\r\ntails and after some scratching with the feet.\r\n\r\nOther godwits are always pursued with loud outcry, as well as harriers,\r\nlapwings, etc., but there is little real fighting between males, and\r\nwhat there is does not seem to be of a particularly vicious type. The\r\nopponents face each other and attempt to seize each other's bills,\r\nstriking with their feet as they descend from the jump. Such sparring\r\nrarely lasts longer than two or, at the outside, three minutes. In\r\ncoition the hen stands rigid with horizontal bill, the male standing\r\nabout a foot behind her \"with vibratory wings and spread tail, uttering\r\na clear disyllabic note; then he rises and floats forward above the\r\nfemale with dangling legs and no apparent change in the rate of\r\nvibration of his wings. He poses for a moment upon her back, still\r\ncalling with wings held stiffly upspread and vibrating tail. Immediately\r\nafter pairing both birds usually continue feeding.\"\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The breeding grounds of this species vary considerably in\r\ncharacter. On the great heaths of Brabant one may come across a pair\r\nnesting in short, dry heather; in the dune country on the Dutch coast\r\nthey breed among the sea buckthorn and sallow bushes on the sandhills;\r\nin Texel most pairs prefer the rectangular patches of rich grass in the\r\n\"polders\" (reclaimed marshes), while in Jutland and Iceland a few pairs\r\nbreed on the vast expanses of quaking marsh near the coast. Nowhere have\r\nwe met with it more plentifully than in the Dutch polders where I have\r\nseen as many as 13 nests with eggs in a single day. All were much alike;\r\na saucer-like hollow in the ground where the grass was thickest and\r\nrichest, lined with a thick pad of dead grass.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Here are laid the four pyriform eggs; five have been recorded\r\nonce or twice, but the only case of six eggs which is known to me was\r\nprobably due to two females sharing a nest. As a rule the eggs do not\r\nvary much, though sometimes a single egg may be found in which the\r\nground color is pale bluish gray with blotches of deeper ashy gray and a\r\nfew darker flecks. The great majority of eggs vary in color from\r\ngreenish or olive green to olive brown and occasionally reddish brown in\r\nground, with blotches or spots of darker brown or olive and a few ashy\r\nshell marks. The measurements of 100 eggs average 54.71 by 37.37\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =59.8= by 37.8,\r\n55.3 by =40.7=, =48.5= by 37.7, and 55 by =34= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The only estimate of the incubation period known to me is that\r\nof Faber, who gives it as 24 days, but recent evidence on this point is\r\nlacking. Both sexes share in the work of incubation, according to von\r\nWangelin, and this is confirmed by Huxley and Montague, who noticed that\r\nin the earlier stages the male spent, at least in one case, three hours\r\non the nest to one by the female. This, however, applies only to the\r\ndaytime. Hantzsch's statement, that apparently it is carried out by the\r\nhen alone, seems to be quite erroneous. The downy young as soon as dried\r\nare led out of the nest and are closely attended to by both parents.\r\nOnly a single brood is reared in the season.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The molts and plumages are fully described in \"A Practical\r\nHandbook of British Birds,\" edited by H. F. Witherby (1920), to which\r\nthe reader is referred.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Naumann (1887) records insect larvae, worms, snails and slugs,\r\nfish and frog spawn, tadpoles; also insects (Coleoptera, Orthoptera, and\r\nOdonata). On migration, shells of small marine and fresh-water mollusca\r\nhave been found in stomachs, also insects, small shore crustacea\r\n(Gammaridae) and the usual sand or gravel.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The godwits are striking looking birds, readily\r\nrecognizable in summer plumage by the cinnamon pink of the neck and\r\nbreast and the bold contrast of black and white in the tail, taken in\r\nconnection with the long legs and straight, slightly upturned bill. The\r\nlatter character at once distinguishes them from the whimbrels and\r\ncurlews and their large size marks them out from most of the other\r\nEuropean Limicolae. The loud, musical, disyllabic call of the male is\r\nalso very characteristic. In winter the warm coloring is lost, but the\r\ngodwits are noisy birds and at this time of year the breeding note is\r\nreplaced by a monosyllabic _chut_. Moreover, their contour when flying\r\noverhead is peculiar, for the long legs are carried out beyond the tail\r\nand have somewhat the effect of long middle tail feathers not unlike\r\nthose of the Arctic skua or jaeger.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--In the British Isles they begin to appear on our southeast\r\ncoasts in August, though not in any numbers as a rule, and have\r\ngenerally left before the end of October. The Iceland birds assemble in\r\nflocks at the end of August and leave the island by the beginning of\r\nSeptember, while in south Sweden, the Baltic republics, and Poland they\r\ndesert their breeding grounds in the latter part of July and drift\r\nsouthwards to the North German coast. None stay in Holland after\r\nSeptember, and gradually they work their way southward to the shores of\r\nthe Mediterranean, where a certain number winter in favorable\r\nlocalities. The main streams of migration seem to be towards the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar on the west side and along the east side of the Balkan\r\nPeninsula, but along the west side of the peninsula they are much\r\nscarcer. Considerable numbers of west Asiatic birds migrate to the\r\nmarshes of the Euphrates and winter there, while others pass into India\r\nand Burma.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--During the winter months these godwits either haunt the\r\nseashore, displaying special preference for low-lying coasts where\r\nextensive areas of mud flats are exposed at low tide, or else are to be\r\nfound where there are large marshes along the edges of lakes, and less\r\nfrequently by the banks of rivers. On the open coasts and the Spanish\r\nmarismas they are subject to a good deal of persecution from the larger\r\nfalcons, especially the peregrine, which greatly appreciates them as an\r\narticle of diet. Lord Lilford describes the great flocks of these\r\ngodwits on the lower reaches of the Guadalquiver as spreading out into\r\nlong lines or gathering into dense masses like starlings or dunlins,\r\nwhen trying to avoid the attentions of their long-winged enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--In Iceland it is very local, being confined to the\r\nlow-lying country in the southwest (Arnes and Rangarvalla-Sysla), where\r\nit breeds in fair numbers; Faroes (only once definitely recorded);\r\nformerly in the British Isles from Yorkshire to Norfolk, but extinct as\r\na breeding species since 1847, unless a possible Lincolnshire record for\r\n1885 is accepted; Belgium, Holland, and its islands, West Jutland, North\r\nGermany, locally in South Sweden, Hungary, Poland, the Baltic Republics\r\n(Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia); in Russia, according to Buturlin, it\r\nbreeds in the governments of St. Petersburg (Leningrad), Moscow, Riazan,\r\non the Volga south to the mouth of the Kama, in the Ufa and Perm\r\ngovernments north to 60° N. In western Asia it nests in the Tobolsk\r\ngovernment. The Irtysh Valley, Baraba Steppe, and locally in Turkestan,\r\nbut the exact limits of this and the smaller eastern race (_L. l.\r\nmelanuroides_ Gould) are not yet defined.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The main winter quarters of this species are in the\r\nMediterranean region, the coasts of North Africa, and the Nile Valley,\r\nthe marshes of Iraq and the Indian Peninsula east of Burma. It has been\r\nrecorded from the Azores, Maderia, and the Canaries; is common in\r\nsuitable localities along the North African littoral from Morocco\r\nthrough Algeria and Tunisia to Egypt, and has been recorded from the\r\nEgyptian Sudan, Kordofan, and Abyssinia, and exceptionally as far South\r\nas Natal. In Asia it ranges to the Persian Gulf, the Indian Peninsular,\r\nbut scarce in the south, Ceylon, Burma, etc., while the eastern race\r\nvisits the islands of Malaysia and ranges to Australia.\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--The northward movement from Morocco takes place in\r\nFebruary and March and it appears in Andalusia in February (late date\r\nApril 6). In Corsica it has been noted as late as April 23 and on\r\npassage, Malta, March 24-25. In Tunisia it is most plentiful in February\r\nand March, and does not stay in Egypt after March (late date April 7).\r\nIt also stays in the plains of northern India until March (late date\r\nDelhi, May 25). It passes through Portugal in February and March; Italy\r\nin March and April; Greece (February 10, March 7, etc.); Montenegro,\r\nlarge flock March 17-25; Bulgaria (March 10-31, flock of 200 on April\r\n1).\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--The southward bound hosts arrive in Andalusia in\r\nAugust-September, but in Portugal, though a few appear in September,\r\nmost pass in October. In north Italy the earliest arrival dates from the\r\nend of July, and in the Balkan Peninsular and the passage lasts from\r\nSeptember to November (early date August 18, Bulgaria, late date\r\nNovember 13, Bulgaria), reaching Egypt in October. At the Euphrates\r\nmarshes it arrives early in August and reaches India in October (early\r\ndate, Nepal, September 7).\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--In Holland and Germany the first eggs may be found in the\r\nlast 10 days of April and early May, but as they are largely taken for\r\nthe market at that time, many sets in collections are second and even\r\nthird layings. Seven records, April 18-30; 10 records, May 1-10; 12\r\nrecords, May 11-20; 8 records, May 21-25. In Jutland breeding is rather\r\nlater; six records May 10-15; and still later in Iceland, six records,\r\nMay 23-June 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOTTIS NEBULARIA (Gunnerus)\r\n\r\nGREENSHANK\r\n\r\n_Contributed by Francis Charles Robert Jourdain_\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThe claim of this species to a place in the North American list dates\r\nback to Audubon, who obtained three specimens on Sand Key, near Cape\r\nSable, Florida. Since that occurrence no other specimens have been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--There are few species the study of whose family life is\r\nattended with greater difficulties than the greenshank. In the first\r\nplace it is an exceedingly wary and keen-sighted bird, and furthermore,\r\nit is not sociable during the breeding season, each pair nesting apart\r\nfrom its fellows in some of the wildest and most desolate country\r\nimaginable. In the British Isles its main breeding grounds are on the\r\nvast expanse of sodden moorland, interspersed here and there by lochs\r\nand \"flows\" (stretches of water-logged ground with black peaty pools),\r\nwhich cover a great part of the Scottish counties of Sutherland,\r\nCaithness, and Ross. Further southward it also breeds on suitable ground\r\nin Inverness-shire and other parts, but here the country is more broken\r\nand varied and there are big stretches of old pine forest and more\r\nmodern coniferous plantations. In both classes of country observation is\r\nattended with difficulties. On the open treeless moorlands houses are\r\nfew and far between, the climate is anything but inviting in early May,\r\nrainstorms are frequent, varied by squalls of hail and fogs, while in\r\nsome seasons heavy snowfalls take place from time to time. On the other\r\nhand the country is open, with few hills of any size, and the direction\r\nof the birds' flight can be marked for long distances, while further\r\nsouth, though the extent of possible breeding ground is infinitely\r\nsmaller, it is far more difficult to follow a bird in flight as it skims\r\nover a belt of forest or round a shoulder of a hill. So it is little\r\nwonder that of the actual courtship of the greenshank we have hardly\r\nanything on record. What little we know may be classified under two\r\nheads; the wonderful song flight of the male and the ritual of the\r\ncourtship itself. The song flight may be seen even after incubation has\r\nbegun, though possibly only in the earlier stages, and has been noticed\r\nby several observers. The fullest and best description is that of Mr. J.\r\nWalpole Bond (1923), which may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n     When singing, the greenshank rises fairly high--sometimes very\r\n     high--above the moor and starts by soaring, head to wind, of\r\n     course. It may then remain soaring, looking very hawklike indeed,\r\n     while it sings. Or else--and this generally happens--it varies the\r\n     performance by proceeding in a succession of downward, inverted\r\n     arcs of good size, though soaring is resumed for a few moments as\r\n     the summit of each curve is reached. In this case \"singing\" only\r\n     takes place on the downward portion of the curve; on the down\r\n     curve, too, the wings are sometimes vibrated very rapidly.\r\n     Sometimes also when the \"song\" itself is in progress the wings are\r\n     flicked up and down with measured rhythm.\r\n\r\nThe song itself is a musical and moderately fast repeated dissyllable\r\n_tew-hoo_, a rich note, harmonizing with the desolate surroundings in\r\nwhich bird life, except for an occasional meadow pipit, (_Anthus\r\npratensis_) is often almost entirely absent. Walpole Bond also notes a\r\ntwanging and metallic _chuck_, _dock_, or _duk_, sometimes heard after\r\neach quick _tew-hoo_, and questions whether this latter sound is vocal\r\nor caused by wings or tail. Personally I have not noticed the latter\r\nsound, perhaps because I have generally heard the song at a great height\r\nand always at some distance. It should be added that this performance is\r\noften kept up for long periods. Gilroy (1922) mentions a case when it\r\nlasted for twenty minutes, and though I have not timed the birds, I have\r\nheard it more or less continually for ten or twelve minutes, ending with\r\na precipitate dive earthwards. Of the actual courtship ritual I have\r\nseen no published record. The birds arrive on their breeding ground\r\nearly in April. On an occasion when a heavy snowfall had practically\r\nwiped out all early nests on the Caithness-Sutherland moors, I saw two\r\nbirds on a little sandy spit by the side of a small loch. The male was\r\nevidently pressing his attentions on his mate and approached her with\r\nhigh flapping wings, showing the underside almost as the redshank does,\r\nand actually raising his wing over the hen until at last coition took\r\nplace. Both birds remained quiet for some little time afterwards and\r\nthen rose together and flew away, calling all the time.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The information with regard to the nesting habits in all the\r\nolder works is of the baldest and scantiest nature, but the last decade\r\nhas seen a great advance in our knowledge and Mr. N. Gilroy (1922) in\r\nparticular has published a fascinating little pamphlet on this bird in\r\nwhich his observations on over twenty nests examined between 1906 and\r\n1922 are carefully coordinated, so that now the actions and movements of\r\nbreeding birds are much better understood. The whole account is of the\r\ndeepest interest, but as it extends to some twenty pages it is only\r\npossible here to give a short résumé of the present stage of our\r\nknowledge. The greenshank generally nests within easy reach of some\r\nsmall lochan, often a mere pool, to which the young can easily be led by\r\nthe parents soon after they are hatched out. The nest itself is usually\r\non dry ground. On the treeless moorlands of Southerland Caithness it is\r\nalmost always made either close up against or actually on one of the\r\nmany grey bits of rock lying amongst the heather. Exceptionally it has\r\nbeen found on the top of a hummock, but as a rule should be looked for\r\nwithin a few hundred yards of the feeding ground, sometimes quite\r\nexposed but difficult to see as the sitting bird exactly resembles in\r\ncolor the grey stones lying about and generally sits till almost trodden\r\non. In the Inverness country the birds nest close to a mark, just as the\r\nSutherland birds do, but here instead of a grey boulder it is usually a\r\nbit of bleached and dead pine, of which thousands of fragments lie\r\nscattered about. Exceptionally I have known a bird make use of an iron\r\nfence post as a mark. When a bird has been found standing about the edge\r\nof some tiny pool the probability is that his mate is sitting not far\r\naway, but the difficulty of finding her is vastly increased by the fact\r\nthat the main feeding ground is generally by the side of a good-sized\r\nlake, which may be any distance from one to four miles away, and here\r\none of the pair may spend the greater part of the day. Moreover, it is\r\nnot uncommon to find that several pairs of birds use the same lakeside\r\nas their main resting and feeding ground. Even so, if the sexes changed\r\nduties at short intervals or behaved in exactly the same manner, it\r\nwould not be a matter of great difficulty to trace a bird back to its\r\nnesting ground. But there seems to be considerable individual variation\r\nin this respect. There is, however, a very strong tendency to return to\r\nthe same breeding place year after year. The classical case is T. E.\r\nBuckley's record of a nest found between two stones which was again\r\noccupied two seasons later presumably by the same bird, but there are\r\ninnumerable cases where two or three nesting sites, used in as many\r\nyears, lie within one hundred yards of one another. This makes the\r\ndiscovery of nests much easier if one can revisit the district for two\r\nor more years in succession. New nests are merely saucer-like\r\ndepressions with a few heather stalks and some dead bents, but almost\r\nalways some leaves of bay myrtle or bilberry in the hollow, and if the\r\nbird has begun to sit, some of its own small breast feathers.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Normally, four in number, occasionally only three, while five\r\nhave occurred; second layings usually consist of three eggs. Larger\r\nnumbers, such as eight, recorded by Booth, are probably due either to\r\ntwo hens laying together or one clutch spoilt by weather and a second\r\nlaid subsequently. They are pyriform in shape and wonderfully handsome,\r\nthe ground color varies from stone color to warm buff, marked sometimes\r\nsparingly and sometimes freely with irregular spots and blotches of deep\r\nred-brown, as well as ashy or purplish shell marks. In most eggs the\r\nmarkings are heavier at the large end. The measurements of 100 eggs\r\naverage 51.41 by 34.80 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes\r\nmeasure =59.8= by =37.7=, =45.8= by 35.4, and 50.4 by =32.4=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--That incubation is sometimes shared by both sexes is proved by\r\nthe fact that both Walpole Bond and Seton Gordon have witnessed the\r\nchange of duties and the latter has actually photographed the birds in\r\nthe act of changing places. Yet Gilroy watched one bird from 10.45 a. m.\r\nto 7.50 p. m., which remained all the time at a loch side in Sutherland\r\non May 16, although its mate was sitting on a clutch of fresh eggs.\r\nEvidently there is considerable individual variation in this respect.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The molts and plumages are fully described in \"A Practical\r\nHandbook of British Birds,\" edited by H. F. Witherby (1920), to which\r\nthe reader is referred.\r\n\r\n_Food._--During the breeding season the food consists chiefly of insects\r\nand their larvae, but tadpoles and frog spawn are freely taken and Oswin\r\nLee records a pair feeding busily for nearly an hour in the evening on\r\nthem, and small water beetles. Freshwater mollusca, such as _Planorbis_,\r\nare also taken and occasionally a small fish. Along insects the\r\nfollowing genera of Coleoptera have been recorded: _Phyllopertha_,\r\n_Cneorhinus_, _Harpalus_, _Dytiscus_, _Gyrinus_, _Aphodius_, and\r\n_Ilybius_. Among Diptera, Tipula and their larvae; also _Notonecta\r\nglauca_ and _Lestes nympha_. In the autumn and winter a great part of\r\nthe food is picked up on the coast and includes worms, lug-worms,\r\ncrustacea (_Palaemon_, _Crangon_, _Hippolyte_, _Squilla_, and in large\r\nnumbers Gammaridae).\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Although a large proportion of its breeding area is\r\nabsolutely devoid of trees, the greenshank also nests in country\r\nintersected by belts of forest, and it is interesting to note that it\r\nperches readily on trees and makes good use of them as lookout posts. It\r\nis always wary and readily takes alarm, rising with loud outcry on the\r\napproach of danger. As MacGillivray notes, when searching for food it\r\noften wades out into the water until it reaches nearly to the tarsal\r\njoint and moves \"with rapidity, running rather than walking and almost\r\nconstantly vibrating its body.\" It is interesting to note the difference\r\nin the behavior of individual birds under similar circumstances. As a\r\nrule the incubating bird sits very closely and will sometimes allow\r\nherself to be touched before leaving the eggs. When flushed one bird\r\nwill spring up and dart away with rapid flight and a single cry of\r\nalarm, another will for a minute or two fly about with deafening clamor,\r\nand in one case a bird dashed off but pitched about five yards away,\r\nyelping loudly and next minute flew straight at my head, with repeated\r\ncries of _Ip, chip, chip, ip, chip, chip_, etc. Just as it reached me it\r\nsheered off with its long green legs dangling, but returned to the\r\ncharge again, repeating the process ten or twelve times, after which it\r\nsettled on the ground and called vociferously, but after 10 minutes had\r\npassed flew away still calling. This behavior was, of course, quite\r\nexceptional.\r\n\r\nN. Gilroy (1922) lays great stress on one note uttered when the bird is\r\nabout to take its place on the eggs. This is a clear, piercing cry of\r\n_Tchook-tchook-tchook_, continually uttered till the bird settles down\r\non the nest. It does not necessarily imply that the bird is rendered\r\nuneasy by the presence of a watcher and is apparently used even when the\r\nbird is quite undisturbed, so if one is lucky enough to be within\r\nearshot when it is uttered it forms a valuable clue to the position of\r\nthe nest.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--When the young are fledged the family parties make their way to\r\nthe coast. Here they frequent the \"pools of brackish water at the heads\r\nof the sand fords and the shallow margins of the bays and creeks\" as\r\nMacGillivray says. The same writer describes its flight as \"rapid,\r\ngliding, and devious, it alights abruptly, runs to some distance, stands\r\nand vibrates.\" By September or October at the latest it leaves its\r\nhaunts in Scotland and makes its way southward along the coast line.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Although there are a few midwinter records even in the\r\nBritish Isles by far the greater proportion of these birds spend the\r\nwinter from the Mediterranean southward and in southern Asia, the Malay\r\nArchipelago, Australia, etc. Here they are chiefly known as shore birds,\r\nonly occasionally being found by the sides of inland lakes and marshes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--Scotland, chiefly in the north, but has extended its\r\nrange of late years; Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, south to the\r\ngovernments of St. Petersburg, Pskov, Tula, Riazan, Kazan, and Ufa;\r\nacross northern Asia to Kamchatka, south to latitude 55° in the west and\r\n54° in the east.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The Mediterranean countries and Africa, south to Cape\r\nProvince and Natal; in Asia, India, Ceylon, Burma, Siam, China, Hainan,\r\nFormosa, and Japan; Sunda Islands, Moluccas, Borneo, Java, Timor,\r\nSumatra, Norfolk Island, Australia, and New Zealand.\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--From its winter quarters in South Africa it is\r\nrecorded from Morocco (Mogador) in May and near Gibraltar in March,\r\nApril, and May (late date May 22); passes Corsica in some numbers (May\r\n8), arrives in Greece, where some also winter, at the end of March and\r\nin April, leaving in May (late date May 8); leaves Egypt in March;\r\npasses Cyprus in April and leaves the marshes of lower Iraq at the end\r\nof April, and also leaves India about the same time. In France it\r\narrives late in April or early May, and in Spain has been observed as\r\nlate as the third week of May, even in the south. First arrivals reach\r\nSouth Russia in March and pass through north Germany about mid-April,\r\narriving on the British coasts from the middle of April onward and in\r\nsouth Sweden in the latter part of May.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--While the spring migration is usually noticed only in\r\nsmall numbers, in pairs or even singly, the fall migration is better\r\nmarked. From mid-July to late in November they may be met with on the\r\nBritish coasts, but most birds leave in September-October, passing\r\nthrough Holland in August and September-October; in North France (early\r\ndate mid-July), and reaching Spain in September, crossing over the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar in October, and Malta in September (occasionally in\r\nJune, July, and August, probably non-breeders). From Bulgaria it is\r\nreported in September (early date August 20); Montenegro, September\r\n(early date July 19); Cyprus, October 3; and Greece, arrives in\r\nSeptember. Some birds reach the marshes of Iraq at the end of July, but\r\nmostly in August, and in India from the middle to the end of September,\r\nPegu in October. Along the west coast of Africa they are noted from\r\nMogador (September), Gambia (September), Gold Coast (September 13), Cape\r\nProvince and Natal (September-October).\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--Has occurred in Madeira, the Canaries, Azores,\r\nMauritius (once). Cape Verde Islands, Florida (Audubon), Norfolk Island,\r\nChile, and Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Some 39 dates from Scotland all fall in May. The earliest\r\ndate for a full clutch is May 9. From May 9 to 16 (22 dates), 17 to 23\r\n(11 dates), 23 to 28 (5 dates).\r\n\r\n\r\nTOTANUS TOTANUS (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\nREDSHANK\r\n\r\n_Contributed by Francis Charles Robert Jourdain_\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThe redshank is a recent addition to the American list. Two specimens\r\nhave been shot near Angmagsalik, in East Greenland, the first on May 29,\r\n1902, and the second on April 24, 1909, and were recorded by the\r\nsuperintendent, Johan Petersen. Unfortunately, neither bird was sent to\r\nCopenhagen, so it remains uncertain whether they belong to the typical\r\nrace or to the larger form described by Lehn Schiøler as _T. totanus\r\nrobustus_. Doctor Coues suggested (1897) that the redshank should be\r\nincluded in the hypothetical list of North American birds on the ground\r\nof a specimen said to have been taken on Hudson Bay and transmitted to\r\nthe British Museum, where, however, it is not to be found.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Fortunately we have very full accounts of the courtship\r\nand love song of this species from the observations of Messrs. E.\r\nSelous, W. Farren, and J. S. Huxley. Mr. Farren's (1910) account\r\n(incorporating much of Mr. Selous's notes) is as follows:\r\n\r\n     In courting, the male redshank approaches the female with his head\r\n     erect and his body drawn up tall and straight. As he draws near he\r\n     raises his wings high above his head for an instant as when\r\n     alighting on the ground after a flight. Then allowing his wings\r\n     gradually to droop he vibrates them and also his legs, the latter\r\n     very rapidly, with a motion suggestion of a soldier \"marking time.\"\r\n     Mr. Selous (1906) has described this action, including the\r\n     vibrating of the wings and legs, as follows: \"The male bird,\r\n     walking up to the female, raises his wings gracefully above his\r\n     back. They are considerably elevated, and for a little he holds\r\n     them aloft merely; but soon, drooping them to about half their\r\n     former elevation, he flutters them tremulously and gracefully as\r\n     though to please her.\" The female, as though unimpressed, turned\r\n     from him and continued to feed, which did not greatly disturb her\r\n     amorous wooer, as he also commenced to peck about as though\r\n     feeding. But very soon he again walks up to the female \"and now\r\n     raising his wings to the fluttering height only, flutters them\r\n     tremulously as before. He walks on a few steps and stops. He again\r\n     approaches, and standing beside her--both being turned the same\r\n     way--with his head and neck as it were curved over her, again\r\n     trembles his wings, at the same time making a little rapid motion\r\n     with his red legs on the ground as though he were walking fast, yet\r\n     not advancing.\" This action occurs with fair frequency during the\r\n     period before egg laying. I have witnessed it several times, having\r\n     first been attracted by the raised wings of the male, rendered\r\n     conspicuous by the white secondaries and undersides, without which\r\n     I should probably not have seen the birds at all.\r\n\r\nThe habit of deliberately extending the wings upward on alighting, and\r\nthus exposing the light undersurface is one of the most characteristic\r\nactions of the redshank, and the white gleaming of the wing for a\r\nsecond or so before the wings are furled often enables one to identify\r\nthe species even when the birds themselves are too far off to be\r\nrecognized otherwise. Mr. Farren (1910) also adds:\r\n\r\n     Redshanks are fond of perching, either on horizontal branches of\r\n     trees, on posts or rails; in the Cambridgeshire fens I have seen\r\n     them displaying, as described by Stevenson, on the long low stacks\r\n     of freshly dug peat, and also on the ground. A male may be seen\r\n     running fussily about in front of the female, vibrating its body\r\n     and drooping its wings and often uttering a note similar to the\r\n     trilling song which accompanies the spring soaring flight.\r\n\r\nJ. S. Huxley (1912) gives a clearer and more complete picture of the\r\ncourtship than any previous describer. The first stage consists in the\r\npursuit of a hen by a male bird. Directly he stops feeding and runs\r\nafter her, she runs away. Never in a straight line for any distance, but\r\nin a series of curves, often doubling back and sometimes describing a\r\ncircle or even a figure of eight, while the cock follows her line a few\r\nyards behind. The cock's head is held sideways at an angle of quite 20\r\ndegrees with the line of his body in order to keep the hen in view, and\r\nhis neck is stiffly stretched out. His pure white tail is expanded so\r\nthat half is visible on each side of his folded wings. The chase often\r\nlasts for quite a long time, when the hen flies off leaving the male\r\ndisconsolate, but sometimes she will stop and then the second stage\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\nThe male may run on a yard or two, but soon stops.\r\n\r\n     He first unfolds his wings and raises them right above his back so\r\n     as to expose their conspicuous undersurface of pure white, somewhat\r\n     clouded or barred with grey. Then fluttering them tremulously but\r\n     keeping them raised all the time he advances very, very slowly\r\n     towards the hen, lifting his feet high in the air and often putting\r\n     them down scarcely in advance of where they were before. Meantime\r\n     as he steps on he stretches his neck a little forward, opens his\r\n     mouth, and gives utterance to a single continuous note, which is\r\n     changed into a long roll or rattle by the quick vibration of the\r\n     lower mandible. The sound is quite like that of a nightjar, but\r\n     higher and without any of the little breaks in the pitch of the\r\n     note. So he advances closer and closer, the hen usually remaining\r\n     motionless. Again at any time during this stage she may reject his\r\n     suit by flying off, but if she is going to accept him, she simply\r\n     stays still, often without moving a muscle the whole time. As the\r\n     cock gets closer, he gets more and more excited, vibrates his wings\r\n     more and more rapidly, at length so fast that almost his whole\r\n     weight is supported by them, though he still continues to execute\r\n     the high stepping movements with his feet. At last when just behind\r\n     the hen, he abandons the ground and flutters up on to her back on\r\n     which he half alights. The period when he is there on her back is\r\n     the third and last state of the courtship; it is very short and is\r\n     of course in a sense nothing more than getting into the proper\r\n     position for the actual pairing. Sometimes the hen, suddenly\r\n     repugnant, gives a violent jerk or sideways twist and shakes him\r\n     forcibly on to the ground, herself running or flying away.\r\n     Occasionally, however, she apparently is satisfied; she spreads her\r\n     tail diagonally and the cock with a quick and wonderfully graceful\r\n     motion, half supported all the time by his fluttering wings,\r\n     accomplishes the act of pairing. Then the hen gives the same\r\n     violent twist that I have just mentioned, he gets shaken off, and\r\n     they both begin quietly feeding, often side by side.\r\n\r\nThe love flight of the redshank is a very striking feature of the\r\ncourtship and may be seen even after incubation has begun. J. S. Huxley\r\n(1912) describes it as follows:\r\n\r\n     A redshank rises up into the air, and there flies in a series of\r\n     switchbacks. Just before the bottom of each switchback he gave very\r\n     quick wing flaps, almost fluttering, one would call it, this made\r\n     him start up again. He went on fluttering or flapping till he was\r\n     about halfway up and for the rest of the upstroke of the switchback\r\n     he soared up with the impetus he had gained. His wings now were set\r\n     back and down; his neck and head thrown up in a beautiful proud\r\n     attitude; his tail spread out. Then he turned the angle of his\r\n     wings and glided down, still in the same attitude.\r\n\r\nWhile flying thus he gives vent to what one may call a song--a series of\r\npure, sweet single notes, never uttered on other occasions. The flight\r\nmay be quite short, or may go on for several minutes. W. Farren (1910)\r\nwriting of the same love-flight describes the song as \"_Dhu-lee,\r\ndhu-lee, du-lee, du-lee, du-le, dle-dle-dle-dle_,\" the latter part\r\nbecoming shorted and quicker as it nears the end, when it may be\r\ncontinued to a vanishing point.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the nightjar-like note already referred to is\r\nonly used on the second stage of the courtship, yet it was audible at\r\nall hours of the day and night from which Huxley deduced that, as only a\r\nfraction of the courtships were consummated and the total number of\r\nbirds did not exceed 50, each bird must pair several times a day.\r\n\r\nThe contests between the males seem to be usually of a formal character,\r\nbut Selous (1906) describes one case where two birds fought with\r\ndetermination, jumping at one another and each attempting to seize the\r\nmandibles of the other with its own.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The Iceland redshank has very similar habits to the ordinary\r\nEuropean bird and haunts the swamps and morasses near the sea as well as\r\nthe neighborhood of the larger lakes inland during the breeding season.\r\nHere it nests in colonies, varying in number from five or six to about\r\ntwenty pairs. The nests are usually some distance apart, and generally\r\nwell concealed, the sitting bird choosing a hollow where the vegetation\r\ngrows thickest. In the British Isles the common redshank has greatly\r\nincreased its breeding range during the last 25 years and has gradually\r\nmade its way inland up the river valleys to many districts where it was\r\npreviously quite unknown. Here it shares its breeding grounds with the\r\nlapwing (_Vanellus vanellus_), but the nest is not exposed like that of\r\nthe latter but neatly hidden at the foot of some tall wisp of dead\r\ngrass. The bird will even twist the dead grasses together to get the\r\nrequired protection and some nests are so artfully hidden that they can\r\nonly be found by accidentally flushing the bird. In an East Anglian\r\nmarsh a bird got up almost at my feet. There was a small flattened\r\ntussock of grass with long dead stalks growing up round it, but not a\r\nsign of nest or eggs, yet I felt certain that the bird had been\r\nincubating. On probing the solid-looking green tussock my fingers\r\nslipped into a hollow space beneath, where the four eggs were lying. The\r\nbird had been sitting in a neat cup of grass, completely roofed in\r\nabove, and had slipped out by parting the growing grass at the side,\r\nwhich had closed up again. Exceptionally nests may be found, especially\r\nnear the coast, quite exposed, but as a rule the bird takes advantage of\r\nevery bit of cover available. On the level patches of short rich grass\r\nin the Dutch polders many pairs breed, and I have seen sixteen nests in\r\na day. Narrow drains only a few inches wide are cut by the farmers in\r\nthe turf, and here the grass is not cropped quite so close at the sides,\r\nso even under these disadvantageous conditions the redshanks avoid the\r\nopen flats and prefer the partial concealment of the drain sides. In the\r\ngreat mud flats of the Marisma of the River Guadalquiver in South Spain,\r\ntoo, there is little in the way of cover, but the nests are never so\r\nexposed as those of the stilt or avocet. But wherever found, whether in\r\nIceland, Holland, or Spain, there are the excited parents flying round\r\nand round with incessant and clamorous cries of _tu-e-too, tu-e-too_,\r\nalarming all the other breeding species and generally the first to give\r\nwarning of danger.\r\n\r\nThe nest is substantially made of grasses and hollowed out by the\r\npressure of the bird's breast and little in the way of extraneous matter\r\nis used, though occasionally, especially in open sites, quite a\r\nsubstantial cup may be built of stalks, grasses, bits of heath, moss,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Normally four, rarely five, but in second or third layings\r\nthree are not uncommon, and cases of six, seven, and eight eggs in a\r\nnest have been recorded, probably due to two hens laying together,\r\nthough in some instances they may be due to a full clutch being laid\r\nafter an interruption by snow or floods. The eggs are pyriform in shape\r\nand when large series are examined, show considerable variation, the\r\nground color ranging from creamy white, stone color, to pale greenish\r\ngray or light purplish red and warm reddish ochreous. They are freely\r\nblotched and spotted with purple brown or rich red brown and ashy shell\r\nmarks; sometimes a dark hair streak at the big end. In some eggs the\r\nblotches are very large, but others are more uniformly marked with small\r\nspots. In a series they show much richer and redder coloring than\r\n_Vanellus_, _Himantopus_, or _Recurvirostra_, and lack the distinctive\r\ngreen ground of _Tringa erythropus_. The measurements of 36 eggs from\r\nIceland average 45.39 by 31.75 millimeters; the eggs showing the four\r\nextremes measure 49 by 32.4, 46.5 by =33.1=, =42.3= by 31.3, and =43.7=\r\nby =30.5= millimeters. The measurements of 100 British eggs average\r\n44.56 by 31.56 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure\r\n=48.4= by 32.4, 46.5 by =33.1=, and =41.5= by =28.5= millimeters. It\r\nwould be seen from the above figures that Icelandic eggs (like the\r\nbirds) are slightly larger than British specimens. The incubation period\r\nlasts 23 to 25 days and is apparently chiefly undertaken by the female,\r\nbut J. Cunningham has shot the male from the eggs.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The molts and plumages are fully described in \"A Practical\r\nHandbook of British Birds,\" edited by H. F. Witherby (1920), to which\r\nthe reader is referred.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The redshank is a shore feeder to a great extent for the autumn\r\nmonths and often a riverside and marsh harvester in spring and summer.\r\nIn the latter season its food consists chiefly of insects and their\r\nlarvae, including Coleoptera (_Hyphidrus_, _Onthophagus_, etc.),\r\nDiptera, especially Tipulidae; also the larvae of Ephemeridae and\r\nPhryganeidae, spiders, worms (_Lumbrici_); and it is said small frogs\r\nand berries are also taken. In autumn crustacea (including Gammaridae,\r\nshrimps, and small crabs) are taken; also Mollusca (_Cardium_) and\r\nsmaller marine univalves and annelids in addition to insect food when\r\nprocurable; and small fish have been found in the stomach by Professor\r\nPatten.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The restless and wary nature of this very numerous species\r\nrenders it very unpopular with the shore shooters, as its loud yelping\r\ncry of _Took took_ alarms every bird within earshot. As they are poor\r\neating and do not pay for shooting, they frequently escape, although a\r\ngood many are shot. During the breeding season it is quite a common\r\nsight to see a redshank perched on a post, or tripping lightly along a\r\nrail with upraised wings, and it will at times even settle on a tree.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--As soon as the young are able to fly (for only one brood is\r\nreared in the season) the redshanks form into family parties or small\r\nflocks and work their way down the valleys toward the shore. On the\r\nBritish coasts large reinforcements arrive from the continent, but it is\r\nnot possible to tell whether the birds which remain throughout the\r\nwinter are visitors from the north or locally bred birds. In Iceland\r\nthey leave about the end of September or early in October, and on the\r\nBritish coasts are most numerous from mid-July to mid-November.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--The main winter quarters of this species are in Africa, but\r\nit is of scarce occurrence in the south; and also in southwestern Asia;\r\nfarther east in Asia it is replaced by other races, which winter in\r\nIndia, the Malay Peninsula, and the islands of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--In Iceland and the Faeroes the breeding race is _T.\r\ntotanus robustus_. The typical race (_T. totanus totanus_) breeds in\r\nsuitable localities throughout the British Isles and the Continent of\r\nEurope, north to latitude 71° in Norway, rare in North Finland, and\r\nscarce in Russian Lapland, while it is absent from the islands off the\r\nNorth Russian coast and reaches about latitude 58° N. in the Urals and\r\n56-1/2° in West Siberia. Southward its range extends to Andalusia,\r\nnorthern Italy, Sardinia, and in small numbers to Greece, as well as at\r\nover 6,000 feet in the Caucasus. Probably it also nests in Morocco,\r\nthough this has not yet been proved, and perhaps also in Tunisia, while\r\nin West Asia it breeds in Turkestan. East Asiatic birds apparently\r\nbelong to another race or races.\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The Iceland race (_T. totanus robustus_) passes through\r\nthe British Isles and has been recorded from Morocco. The typical race\r\n(_T. totanus totanus_) winters in small numbers in the British Isles and\r\nalso on the Scandinavian coast, but not in Central Europe, crossing the\r\nMediterranean and wintering in Africa, where it has been recorded in\r\nCape Province and Natal, but only in small numbers, the majority\r\nevidently wintering in the Tropics. Eastward it is found in the marshes\r\nof Iraq and the shores of the Persian Gulf, but probably Indian birds\r\nand those which winter in Ceylon, the Andamans, Malay Peninsula, China,\r\nHainan, Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Philippines, Celebes, Sunda Islands, and\r\nJapan belong to other races.\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--The passage northward at the Straits of Gibraltar\r\ntakes place in March and April, while in Tunisia most leave in April,\r\nthough specimens have been obtained in June (probably non-breeders); and\r\nin Egypt it stays till April. In Abyssinia it has been met with in March\r\n(March 12, Zoulla) and most leave the marshes of Iraq in mid-May, though\r\nsome stay till the end of the month. It passes Malta in March and April,\r\nand nearly all have left Greece by May, but passes Cyprus in April,\r\narriving in Holland and Denmark in April and Sweden late in that month\r\nand reaching Finland early in May. Large numbers passed over St.\r\nCatherine's Light in the Isle of Wight from 2.30 a. m. till dawn on\r\nApril 3 and 4, 1910.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--In south Sweden it leaves in September and also\r\ndeparts from Denmark and Holland about the same time. The passage at the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar takes place in September and October and in Malta\r\nin September, while in the Iraq marshes the first arrivals take place at\r\nthe end of July, but the majority come in August, and it is recorded\r\nfrom Fao in August and September, arriving in Egypt in September, while\r\nit has occurred as far south as the River Niger in the same month.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--It is an occasional visitor on passage to the\r\nCanaries and has been met with on Madeira (March 15, April 20, 26,\r\nSeptember 24, October 24) as well as in East Greenland (Angmagsalik\r\nApril 24, May 29).\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--In Iceland the eggs are laid from the end of May to early\r\nin June, May 28-June 8 (six dates), June 9-18 (five dates). In the\r\nBritish Isles the first eggs are laid at the end of March and through\r\nApril and May, but late records in May, even in the north, are probably\r\ndue to second layings: March 28 to April 16 (10 dates); April 17 to 25\r\n(16 dates); April 26 to May 5 (10 dates). In the Shetlands Saxby records\r\nthe first eggs on May 16. In Holland I have seen some 60 nests between\r\nMay 11 and 31, but many were undoubtedly second layings. In Salonika\r\neggs have been found as early as March 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOTANUS MELANOLEUCUS (Gmelin)\r\n\r\nGREATER YELLOW-LEGS\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThe names, telltale and tattler, have long been applied to both of the\r\nyellow-legs, and deservedly so, for their noisy, talkative habits are\r\ntheir best known traits. They are always on the alert and ever vigilant\r\nto warn their less observant or more trusting companions by their loud,\r\ninsistent cries of alarm that some danger is approaching. Every\r\nsportsman knows this trait and tries to avoid arousing this alarm when\r\nother, more desirable, game is likely to be frightened away. And many a\r\nyellow-legs has been shot by an angry gunner as a reward for his\r\nexasperating loquacity.\r\n\r\nThe two yellow-legs are still left on our list of game birds, because\r\ntheir numbers do not seem to decrease much in spite of the large numbers\r\nthat are killed every year by sportsmen. William Brewster (1925) says\r\nthat he has \"failed to note any decided lessening of their numbers in\r\nNew England during the past 30 or 40 years.\" This stability in numbers\r\nis probably more apparent than real. The birds have been driven from\r\nmany of their former haunts by increased building of summer colonies,\r\nimprovements in seashore resorts, draining and filling of marshes, and\r\nother changes; so that fewer birds can make the restricted localities\r\nseem as well populated as ever.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The spring migration of the greater yellow-legs is well\r\nmarked on both coasts and in the interior, a generally northward trend.\r\nIt begins in March, reaches the northern States in April and extends\r\nthrough May or even into June, although most of the birds are on their\r\nbreeding grounds in May. The bulk of the flight passes through\r\nMassachusetts in May and through California in April. It seems to avoid\r\nthe prairie regions of southern Canada; William Rowan tells me that he\r\nand C. G. Harrold regard it as \"probably the scarcest of the regular\r\nwaders. In years of steady collecting, during the height of the\r\nmigration, spring and fall, he (Harrold) has seen the greater\r\nyellow-legs only half a dozen times.\" J. A. Munro tells me that in\r\nsouthern British Columbia, Okanagan Landing, it is much less common in\r\nspring than in fall; he has recorded it as early as March 23.\r\n\r\nJ. R. Whitaker writes to me from Newfoundland that he usually sees the\r\nfirst yellow-legs during early May: \"On their first arrival the high\r\ntundras are still in the grip of winter and many of the ponds on the\r\nlower levels are partly covered with ice.\" John T. Nichols tells me that\r\nit is often abundant on Long Island in the spring. He says in his notes:\r\n\"In May, 1919, the waters of a certain nontidal coastal creek, due to\r\nwind conditions, receded to an unprecedented lowness, leaving broad\r\nmuddy shores exposed where almost always water stands. In what seemed\r\nalmost a magical response to the unusual water conditions, about 100\r\ngreater yellow-legs assembled at the creek, the largest flock I have\r\never seen. Alighted, the birds were silent, and without the nervous\r\n_hikkuping_ one associates with this species. Once all got up and\r\ncircled in a compact flock to return to the mud and shallows again.\"\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Mr. Whitaker writes to me:\r\n\r\n     The time for nesting varies as much as 10 days between the few\r\n     pairs which frequent the lower levels and the bulk of the birds\r\n     which nest on the high grounds. On the lowlands a pair of birds\r\n     will take up their quarters near the place they intend to nest soon\r\n     after their arrival and the cock bird may be seen high up in the\r\n     air uttering his nesting song. He will sometimes be so high that he\r\n     appears but a speck against the blue sky. His loud notes carry a\r\n     long distance and sound like _tweda-tweda-tweda_ uttered quickly\r\n     and continually for quite a long time.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles W. Townsend (1920) writes:\r\n\r\n     The courtship song of the greater yellow-legs comes up from the\r\n     marshes of Essex County throughout the month of May, but is heard\r\n     in greater volume during the two middle weeks. It has a sweet and\r\n     pleading character and seems to say _wull yer? wull yer?_ Although\r\n     it differs from the flickerlike call described in the original\r\n     Memoir, which may be heard at the same time, it, too, has a decided\r\n     flickerlike flavor. It is heard throughout the day, but in the\r\n     evening until it is nearly dark the marshes often resound with the\r\n     plaintive callings.\r\n\r\nH. S. Swarth (1911) observed some greater yellow-legs on the wooded\r\nislands of southeastern Alaska in April, of which he says:\r\n\r\n     At this time the males were going through various courting antics,\r\n     posing with upraised, quivering wings, or running in circles on the\r\n     sand bars around the object of their attentions, and incessantly\r\n     uttering the shrill whistle peculiar to the species.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Considering the fact that the greater yellow-legs is such a\r\ncommon and widely distributed bird, remarkably little has been published\r\non its nesting habits, and comparatively few nests have been found, in\r\nspite of the fact that it does not go very far north to breed and its\r\nbreeding grounds are fairly accessible. I know from personal experience\r\nwith it that its nest is very hard to find. I have spent many hours\r\nhunting for its nest on the high tundras of central Newfoundland, where\r\nit breeds commonly, and secured only one set of eggs. The male bird is\r\nvery noisy and solicitous, flying out to meet the intruder while he is a\r\nlong way from the nest, alighting on any available spruce tree, stump,\r\nrock, or other eminince, pouring out a steady stream of invective cries\r\nand showing the greatest anxiety, but giving not the slightest clue as\r\nto the location of the nest. And the female sits so closely on the nest\r\nthat it is only by the merest chance that she can be flushed. The high\r\ntundra around Gafftopsail and Quarry, Newfoundland, is an immense tract\r\nof boggy ground, full of small ponds and muddy splashes, interspersed\r\nwith mossy hummocks and outcroppings of rocks. My set was taken there on\r\nJune 9, 1912; it was in a mere hollow in the moss on a small hummock in\r\na shallow, muddy pond hole; the female was flushed, and the four eggs\r\nwere fresh.\r\n\r\nMr. Whitaker has sent me the following notes on the nesting habits of\r\nthe greater yellow-legs in Newfoundland:\r\n\r\n     On June 17, 1919, whilst walking over a big tundra with a friend\r\n     (Geo. H. Stuart, 3rd), a yellow-shank which flew up from the side\r\n     of a water hole showed considerable excitement, there were a number\r\n     of small ponds just there dotted with mossy islands; we beat all\r\n     the ground between these ponds but could find nothing, however, we\r\n     noticed that each time we approached the edge of the tundra where a\r\n     stunted growth of scattered dead larch trees were, and where the\r\n     wintergreen, laurel, and labrador tea bushes merged into the\r\n     sphagnum of the tundra, the bird seemed more excited and flew close\r\n     round our heads shrieking out his harsh notes _tee erk, tee erk,\r\n     tee erk_ more fiercely. We decided to hide away at some distance\r\n     and watch, thinking this must be the hen bird and we would wait\r\n     until she returned to the nest. We retired several hundred yards\r\n     and hid in some spruces, the bird following part of the way and\r\n     alighted on the top of a bush growing in the moss and there\r\n     remained for upwards of an hour, then flew to a pond near, settling\r\n     on an island, fed for a while, and after preening went to sleep;\r\n     this seemed absolutely hopeless, so we decided to have another look\r\n     over the ground. Each of us had a long pole with a handkerchief\r\n     tied to the end, with these we covered all the ground which\r\n     appeared suitable most thoroughly without any results. I then\r\n     remembered hunting for green-shanks nests in the north of Scotland;\r\n     there the nests were usually placed on a dry ridge, and seeing such\r\n     a ridge near the edge of the tundra I suggested to my friend that\r\n     we should go and look it over. We had not proceeded in its\r\n     direction more than 10 yards when right in front of me and not more\r\n     than 6 feet away on the top of a dry peat hummock amongst some\r\n     scrubby tea plant squatted a yellow-shank with a downy young one on\r\n     her back. I called my friend, who was only a few yards away; he\r\n     came and we both watched the bird for some time before putting her\r\n     up. When she did go there were four downy young in a very slight\r\n     hollow without any trace of nesting material but a few leaves which\r\n     had probably blown in. Amongst these we found some fragments of\r\n     eggshell.\r\n\r\n     On June 6th of the following year I was out on that tundra again\r\n     and worked my way towards where we had found the nest, but never\r\n     saw or heard a sign of the bird. However, I went to the old nest\r\n     and when within 3 feet to my astonishment saw a yellow-shank lying\r\n     flat on the nest. I could hardly believe my eyes. I watched her for\r\n     some time as she sat there perfectly motionless; on putting her up,\r\n     she began to scold loudly, sometimes flying close round my head and\r\n     then she would perch on a dead bush near, bobbing her head,\r\n     uttering _tee erk, tee erk, tee erk_ all the time. Four beautiful\r\n     eggs lay in the slight depression. I had been there fully 15\r\n     minutes when away in the far distance I heard another yellow-shank\r\n     which quickly approached and was evidently the mate, for they both\r\n     continued their abuse until I was out of sight. It very often\r\n     happens that the male bird is not within miles of the incubating\r\n     female, and under these conditions finding a nest is a mere fluke.\r\n     There is one rule which holds good in all the nests I have found,\r\n     and this is that a yellow-legs never nests on ground which is too\r\n     soft to scratch in. There must be soil or dry, hard peat. I once\r\n     found a nest on a boulder which had a thin covering of peat and\r\n     reindeer moss on it, whilst the surrounding ground was wet and\r\n     mossy, so being unsuitable for making a scratch. The nest is nearly\r\n     always placed quite close to a flashet or pond of water; I have\r\n     only twice seen a nest at a distance of 20 yards from any water\r\n     hole.\r\n\r\nWilliam Brewster (1883) found the greater yellow-legs abundant on\r\nAnticosti Island in July and, although he found no eggs or young, he\r\nobtained \"the strongest circumstantial evidence\" that the birds were\r\nbreeding there. The fact that this island has been for many years a\r\nprotected sanctuary may have had some effect in keeping up the supply of\r\nthese birds.\r\n\r\nFifty years or more ago Dr. E. W. Nelson (1877_a_) found several pairs\r\nof greater yellow-legs about the Calumet Marshes, which from their\r\nactions he felt sure were breeding there. He records a nest and four\r\neggs found near Evanston, Illinois, in June, 1876; \"the nest was\r\nsituated in a slight depression at the base of a small hillock near the\r\nborder of a prairie slough, and was composed of grass stems and blades.\"\r\n\r\nErnest S. Norman (1915) while driving over a soft and spongy spot in a\r\nswamp, in Manitoba, in which his team nearly became mired, was surprised\r\nto see a greater yellow-legs fly up from its nest within 1 foot of the\r\nfront wheel of the wagon. The nest, which contained four heavily\r\nincubated eggs on June 24, is thus described:\r\n\r\n     The nest was just a depression in the moss, with a few bits of ivy\r\n     grass as a lining. It had no shelter whatever, as a fire had swept\r\n     over the place about a month previous to the finding of the nest so\r\n     that there was not even grass growing anywhere near the nest.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The four eggs, usually comprising the set, of the greater\r\nyellow-legs are ovate pyriform in shape and have a slight gloss. They\r\nare rather handsomely marked and are practically indistinguishable from\r\neggs of the European greenshank. The ordinary ground colors are pale\r\nbuff, \"light buff\" to \"cartridge buff.\" They are irregularly spotted and\r\nblotched, chiefly about the larger end, with dark browns, \"bay,\" \"liver\r\nbrown,\" and \"chestnut brown,\" and with conspicuous underlying spots and\r\nblotches of various shades of \"purple-drab.\" An especially handsome set\r\nin my collection, one of the most beautiful sets of waders' eggs I have\r\never seen, is richly colored in reddish browns. The ground colors vary\r\nfrom \"pinkish buff\" to \"orange-cinnamon\" or \"sayal brown.\" The four eggs\r\nare heavily and boldly marked with large, longitudinal blotches and\r\nsplashes of rich browns, \"claret brown,\" \"mahogany red,\" and \"bay,\" over\r\nunderlying blotches, nearly concealed, of various shades of \"purple\r\ndrab.\" The measurements of 51 eggs average 48.9 by 33 millimeters; the\r\neggs showing the four extremes measure =53.5= by 33.8, 51.8 by =35.1=,\r\n=43.7= by 31.5, and 44.9 by =30.8= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--We have no data as to the period of incubation or in what way\r\nthe sexes share it. Both sexes share in the care of the young, which are\r\nbrooded by the female for the first day. The young birds referred to by\r\nMr. Whitaker had left the nest on the second day.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--In the downy young greater yellow-legs a median stripe of\r\n\"bone brown\" extends from the bill upwards, increasing in width until it\r\ncovers the whole of the occiput; a wide loral stripe of brownish black\r\nextends from the bill to the eye; the forehead and sides of the crown\r\nare silvery gray; and the cheeks and throat are silky white. The rest of\r\nthe upper parts, hind neck to rump, are variegated or heavily blotched\r\nwith \"bone brown,\" \"wood brown,\" and pale buff, the dark color\r\npredominating, especially on the rump. The under parts are grayish\r\nwhite, almost gray on the breast.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage appears first on the scapulars and back and then on\r\nthe breast. Two young birds, about half grown on June 30, are fully\r\nfeathered on the mantle; the breast is well feathered, but covered with\r\nwhite downy tips, the wings are half grown, but the tail has not\r\nappeared; the crown is \"bister,\" streaked with white; the feathers of\r\nthe back, scapulars, and wing-coverts are \"bister\" or \"warm sepia,\"\r\nspotted or notched with \"pinkish buff\" or buffy white, whitest on the\r\nupper back and most buffy on the scapulars; the sides of the neck and\r\nupper breast are streaked with and the flanks are barred with dusky; the\r\nrest of the under parts are white. This plumage is worn for three months\r\nor more, well into October. Young birds are in this plumage when they\r\npass us on migration, but the buffy tints have mostly faded out to\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nBeginning in October a partial postjuvenal molt takes place involving\r\nthe body plumage, most of the scapulars, and some of the wing coverts.\r\nThis produces a first winter plumage which is similar to that of the\r\nadult, but the general tone of the upper parts is grayer and the\r\nfeathers of the mantle are edged with dull white. The type of William\r\nBrewster's Lower California race, _frazari_, and most of his series of\r\nit are in this plumage.\r\n\r\nA partial, first prenuptial molt, mainly in March and April, involving\r\nthe body feathers, most scapulars, some wing coverts and usually the\r\ntail, produces a first nuptial plumage. Some adult nuptial plumage is\r\nacquired on the head, neck, and breast, but the head and neck are not so\r\nheavily streaked and there is less barring in lighter colors on the\r\nbreast and flanks; but the mantle, back, and scapulars are very\r\ndifferent from the adult winter or nuptial plumages; these feathers are\r\nmore or less variegated, barred or spotted with ashy brown and dark\r\nsepia, and are notched, edged, or tipped with gray, grayish white or\r\nwhite, producing a rather evenly mottled appearance. This is apparently\r\na nonbreeding plumage, for I have seen it only in birds taken far south\r\nof the breeding range. At the first postnuptial molt the following\r\nsummer, which is complete, the adult winter plumage is assumed.\r\n\r\nAdults have a partial prenuptial molt of the body plumage, usually the\r\ntail, scapulars, some tertials, and most wing coverts between February\r\nand May. In the nuptial plumage the crown is nearly all dark sepia; the\r\nmantle and scapulars are very dark sepia, almost black, notched or\r\ntipped with white spots; and the breast and flanks are heavily and\r\nirregularly barred with dark sepia. The white notches and tips wear away\r\ntoward the end of the season. The complete postnuptial molt of the body\r\nplumage occurs in August and September, but the wings are not molted\r\nuntil winter. In adult winter plumage the crown is streaked with sepia\r\nand white about evenly; the breast and flanks are faintly marked, or\r\npeppered, with pale sepia; and the feathers of the back and scapulars\r\nare mainly plain \"wood brown,\" with inconspicuous whitish edgings and\r\nnotches.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The greater yellow-legs seems to prefer to feed in shallow\r\nwater; its long legs enable it to wade in deeper water than most other\r\nwaders, and it is often seen using them to their full extent in water up\r\nto its body. It moves about nimbly and gracefully, actively engaged in\r\ncatching small minnows and water insects, delicately balanced on its\r\nlong legs, bowing or nodding, as if its body were on a pivot, in a very\r\npleasing manner. Much of its food seems to consist of small minnows, in\r\npursuit of which it is very active and lively. Mr. Nichols has sent me\r\nthe following notes on the subject:\r\n\r\n     The greater yellow-legs at times catches killifish up to as large a\r\n     size as it can swallow, wading in water as deep as it can stand.\r\n     Having secured a fish, it manipulates same up its long bill and\r\n     into its mouth. Sometimes it catches a fish tangled in a mass of\r\n     fine water weed, and in this case may either fiddle with and\r\n     disengage it, or work it up to its mouth and swallow it before\r\n     disengaging the bill from the weed. I have seen an unusually large\r\n     fish, probably (_Fundulus heteroclitus_), worked up the bird's bill\r\n     two or three times and turned head first to swallow, stick at the\r\n     base of the bill, and drop into the water again. Finally, with a\r\n     great bulging of face and throat, the fish slipped down.\r\n     Satisfied for the moment, the bird rose and flew to the leeward end\r\n     of the pond hole where it had been feeding, alighted, walked up the\r\n     bank, and stood in a tuft of partly dry grass at the edge of the\r\n     water, quietly facing out into the breeze for some twenty minutes,\r\n     although all the time alert and watchful. In this sheltered\r\n     position it would not have been noticed unless known to be there.\r\n\r\nDr. Paul Bartsch (1899) found a greater yellow-legs in the Washington\r\nmarket whose throat was jammed full of top minnows. He says that many\r\ntimes he has \"watched this bird wade out into the shallow water of the\r\nbars, moving along slowly with tilting gait, suddenly lower that long\r\nhead and neck and proceed to run through the water at a speed which\r\nwould have done credit to a college sprinter, quickly striking to right\r\nand left with his bill.\" Others have noted a similar performance.\r\n\r\nI have occasionally seen greater yellow-legs on damp, grassy meadows\r\nwhere they were probably feeding on insects or their larvae, snails,\r\nworms, or crustaceans, all of which have been found in their stomachs.\r\nLucien M. Turner refers in his notes to a bird he shot at the mouth of\r\nthe Koksoak River, Ungava, on September 18, 1882, which had been feeding\r\non the berries of _Empetrum nigrum_.\r\n\r\nThree birds collected by Stuart T. Danforth (1925) had eaten exclusively\r\nanimal matter: \"The recognizable fragments were: Dragon-fly naiads,\r\n65.33 per cent; aquatic Hemiptera (_Belostoma_ species), 22 per cent;\r\nfish scales (_Poecilia vivipara_), 6.0 per cent; Dytiscid larvae, O.66\r\nper cent.\"\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The flight of the greater yellow-legs is quite swift,\r\nstrong, and well sustained on the downward and sweeping strokes of its\r\nlong, pointed, dark-colored wings. Its long neck and bill extended\r\nforward and its long, yellow legs stretched out behind give it a\r\nslender, rakish appearance which is quite distinctive. It usually flies\r\nat a good elevation and when traveling it often flies at a great height.\r\nIt scans the ground beneath, looking for a suitable place to feed or\r\nsearching for desirable companions. It responds readily to the call of\r\nits own species and will often answer an imitation of its notes from a\r\ngreat distance; sometimes when it is too far away to be seen. When\r\ncoming in from a distance it usually flies in wide circles around the\r\ncaller several times until it is satisfied that it is safe to alight. It\r\nthen comes zigzagging or scaling down on down-curved wings and settles\r\nlightly near its would-be companions. On alighting it stands for a\r\nmoment with its wings extended upward in a graceful attitude, folds them\r\ndeliberately, gives a few jerky bows or upward nods, and then either\r\nbegins to feed or settles down to rest. It is not very particular as to\r\nits companions; it associates freely with any of the smaller waders that\r\nfrequent the mud flats, meadows, or shallow ponds; it seems to be\r\nparticularly fond of the companionship of the teals when they are\r\nfeeding in shallow water. It is not as gregarious as the lesser\r\nyellow-legs; it is most often seen singly or in small parties, but I\r\nhave counted as many as 40 in a flock on rare occasions.\r\n\r\nWhen walking on the ground its movements are lively and its carriage is\r\ngraceful, though its long legs seem to give it a somewhat jerky gait at\r\ntimes. On its breeding ground it often alights on the tops of spruce or\r\nlarch trees, or on bushes or dead stubs, on which it balances rather\r\nawkwardly. It is normally a shy and wary species; large flocks are very\r\ndifficult to approach; but sometimes single individuals seem to be\r\nabsurdly tame in the presence of other tame species or among decoys.\r\nSome good photographs of it have been taken at short range. William\r\nBrewster (1925) tells of one that he approached in the open to within\r\nten feet and then fired his gun directly over it without causing it to\r\nfly. Mr. Nichols suggests, in his notes:\r\n\r\n     It would seem almost as though these birds drew an abstract danger\r\n     line, difficult to cross from the outside without alarming them,\r\n     but once inside which, man became to them a mere harmless item of\r\n     the landscape. I have had a greater yellow-legs, a bird of the year,\r\n     come to decoys (under the impression that they were others of its\r\n     kind) and as the water was too deep, alight and stand on one of the\r\n     decoys, recognizing in it a piece of wood, meanwhile being\r\n     remarkably tame, perhaps waiting for others of the flock (of\r\n     decoys) to take alarm. Is not this pragmatic rather than rational\r\n     philosophy which they possess, the weakness most in favor of the\r\n     gunner who hunts shore birds with decoys?\r\n\r\nHe also adds the following notes on behavior:\r\n\r\n     I have seen the greater yellow-legs preen its plumage in leisurely\r\n     manner without repeatedly dipping the bill in the water, as the\r\n     lesser frequently does. It reached far back over its shoulder,\r\n     lifted a wing slightly to pick under it, stretched its neck up to\r\n     reach the breast with its bill, and scratched its chin deliberately\r\n     with the right foot. On another occasion a bathing bird crouched\r\n     down in shallow water, ducking the head and at the same time\r\n     fluttering and splashing vigorously with the wings.\r\n\r\n     A resting bird stands at ease, neck hunched down, with slight\r\n     alert movements of the head. From time to time it may turn its\r\n     bill back and bury it in the feathers along the back with a little\r\n     shake of same, one eye at least exposed and open though blinking\r\n     sleepily. An interesting pose which may be assumed for two or\r\n     three minutes is with the bill resting diagonally downward across\r\n     the feathers of the breast. It may stand for a long time on one\r\n     motionless straight leg, inclined so as to bring the foot under\r\n     its center of gravity, the other leg raised and concealed by the\r\n     feathers.\r\n\r\n     Though a wounded lesser yellow-legs will sometimes dive and swim\r\n     under water, I have not seen the smaller species alight in spots\r\n     too deep for wading. The greater yellow-legs on the other hand does\r\n     so not infrequently. It swims gracefully with phalaropelike motion\r\n     of the neck, held erect, stern tilted up like that of a gull. In\r\n     shallow water over mud so soft and sticky that it made wading\r\n     difficult I have seen a bird launch itself forward, swimming, as\r\n     the easier method of propulsion.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Mr. Nichols (1920) has published the results of a detailed\r\nstudy of the vocabularies of the two yellow-legs, which are noted for\r\nthe variety of their calls. He has recognized and described nine\r\ndifferent calls of the greater yellow-legs, as follows:\r\n\r\n     (1) The yodle (a rolling _toowhee toowhee_, etc.) is commonest in a\r\n     flock from birds remaining in one locality, not traveling. I think\r\n     I have heard it from a single bird in the fog. It is\r\n     characteristically given in the air, generally with set wings, by\r\n     birds which seem to contemplate alighting. It advertises birds\r\n     tarrying in one general locality, and has probably the function of\r\n     _location_ notice. It is doubtless homologous with the gather call\r\n     of the spotted sandpiper with which it has little analogy.\r\n\r\n     (2) Loud ringing 3, _wheu wheu wheu_. The characteristic cry of\r\n     the species, spring and fall. It is commonly given by passing or\r\n     leaving birds. It advertises the species--and a change of policy\r\n     in the individual according to its loudness. Analogous with notes\r\n     of other species spoken of as _flight notes_ or identification\r\n     notes; occasionally heard from an alighted bird. This call is\r\n     subject to considerable variation, when heard from a bird about to\r\n     drop down and join others feeding it is comparatively low-pitched\r\n     and even, leaving or about to leave a feeding ground, highly\r\n     modulated.\r\n\r\n     (3) Four _wheus_, heard as follows, seem to have a rather definite\r\n     significance: low, hurried, descending, heard from a bird leaving\r\n     companion; short, clear, four, by a following bird; loud, four,\r\n     bird without intention of alighting, trying to flush decoys. This\r\n     may be called a _recruiting_ call.\r\n\r\n     (4) Twos (_wheu wheu_) seem to be characteristic of a _recruit_. A\r\n     \"gentle\" bird which comes nicely to decoys is apt to call in twos\r\n     when approaching and coming in.\r\n\r\n     (5) Rarely, in taking wing in the presence of an intruder, a\r\n     single bird utters a string of unmodulated _wheus_ which breaks up\r\n     into threes or fours as it goes off. This is likely a note of\r\n     _protest_, which would be more common in the breeding season.\r\n\r\n     (6) Conversational murmuring, from a flock dropping in, expresses\r\n     _companionship_ and confidence.\r\n\r\n     (7) Conversational _chup_ notes from birds about to alight, also\r\n     heard from birds alighted, moving about at ease. The _alighting_\r\n     note.\r\n\r\n     (8) Unloud _chups_ identical with the preceding but more hurried,\r\n     given by a small flock of birds as they take wing. The _flushing_\r\n     note.\r\n\r\n     (9) _Kyow_, common in spring, only rarely heard in southward\r\n     migration; probably associated with the breeding season; seems to\r\n     express _suspicion_.\r\n\r\nDifferent renderings of some of the above notes have been given by\r\nothers. Mr. Brewster (1883) describes a note heard on the breeding\r\ngrounds as \"an incessant _clack-clack-clack-clack_, which sounded very\r\nlike the clatter of a mowing machine.\" He then goes on to say: \"In\r\naddition to the cry already described, they uttered a rolling\r\n_pheu-pheu-phe, pheu-pheu-phe_, repeated a dozen times or more in quick\r\nsuccession; a mellow _pheu, pheu, pheu_, resembling the whistle of the\r\nfish hawk; and a soft, hollow _hoo, whoo, whoo_, very like the cooing of\r\na dove. The latter note was given only when the bird perched on the top\r\nof some tall spruce.\"\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The greater yellow-legs resembles the lesser so closely\r\nin color pattern that the two can not be readily distinguished except by\r\ndirect comparison in size. The bill of the greater is relatively larger,\r\nand it is rather more boldly marked. The voices of the two are somewhat\r\ndifferent. Other characters are referred to under the next species.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Adults move off their breeding grounds at an early date and\r\nloiter along in a leisurely manner. The first migrants appear in the\r\nnorthern states in July, sometimes as early as the second or even the\r\nfirst week. Young birds come later; there is usually a heavy flight of\r\nthem during the first half of October, and many linger in Massachusetts\r\nuntil the middle of November or later. Mr. Brewster (1925) says of the\r\nmigration at Umbagog Lake, Maine:\r\n\r\n     \"We often saw them arriving and departing by day, usually in the\r\n     early morning or late afternoon if the weather were fine, at almost\r\n     any time if it were stormy. When seen approaching from farther\r\n     north, they were commonly first sighted so high in the air that\r\n     they looked no bigger than swallows. After circling twice or thrice\r\n     over the lake on set wings, whistling loudly and volubly, they were\r\n     likely to pitch headlong into the marshes to feed and rest there\r\n     during the remainder of the day, if not for a considerably longer\r\n     period, provided no gunner happened to fare that way. Some,\r\n     however, kept straight on without stopping and perhaps without\r\n     lowering their line of flight below the level of the mountain tops\r\n     to the southward over which they were accustomed to pass.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Whitaker tells me that the last of the yellow-shanks move out of\r\nNewfoundland about the end of October; these are probably all young\r\nbirds. And Edward S. Thomas sends me a record for Columbus, Ohio, of\r\nDecember 11, 1925. This bird well deserves the name of \"winter\r\nyellow-legs.\"\r\n\r\nProbably many migrate at sea, from Nova Scotia to the West Indies, for\r\nCapt. Savile G. Reid (1884) says that it is \"more or less common\" in\r\nBermuda, \"arriving early in August and remaining for a month or so,\"\r\nwhere it is \"much in request among the energetic sportsmen.\"\r\n\r\n_Game._--The greater yellow-legs is a fine game bird; I can not say as\r\nmuch for the lesser yellow-legs. Large numbers have been shot in past\r\nyears. Prof. Wells W. Cooke (1912) says: \"A hunter near Newport, Rhode\r\nIsland, shot 1,362 greater yellow-legs in the eight seasons, 1867-1874;\r\nhis highest score, 419 birds, was in 1873, from August 19 to October\r\n19.\" Dr. Charles W. Townsend (1905) reports that \"463 greater\r\nyellow-legs were sent from Newburyport and vicinity on one day, October\r\n11, 1904, to a single stall in Boston market.\" I knew an old gunner who\r\ncelebrated his eightieth birthday a few years ago by shooting 40\r\nyellow-legs.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that the delightful sport of bay-bird shooting, which was\r\nsuch a pleasant feature of our earlier shooting days, had to be\r\ngradually restricted. Hudsonian curlew, and black-bellied and golden\r\nplover and greater yellow-legs were all fine game birds. I could see no\r\nreason for cutting out the curlew, as it is well able to take care of\r\nitself; golden plover were sadly depleted in numbers and black-bellied\r\nplover and both yellow-legs were decreasing; perhaps it was wise to\r\neliminate them all.\r\n\r\nThose were glorious days that we used to spend on the marshes of Cape\r\nCod. On the inner, or bay, side of Monomoy are extensive marshes,\r\nmeadows, sand flats, and mud flats, 9 miles in length and nearly a mile\r\nwide in places at low tide. These were great feeding resorts for hosts\r\nof shore birds; and in the good old days, when there were shore birds to\r\nshoot and when we were allowed to shoot them, blinds were scattered all\r\nalong the marshes and flats. On a dry sand spit or beach a hole was dug\r\nin the sand and seaweed was piled up around it high enough to conceal a\r\nsitting gunner; on a wet marsh a substantial blind was built of brush,\r\nwith a seat in it for two men; in some places in the meadows, where the\r\ngrass grew high, a box or a board to sit on was all the gunner needed.\r\nWooden or tin decoys painted to imitate yellow-legs or plover were set\r\nup in the sand or mud, all facing the wind and within easy range. Here\r\nin a comfortable blind the hunter could lounge at ease, bask in the\r\ngenial sun of early autumn, smoke his pipe and meditate, or watch the\r\nmany interesting things about him, the rich autumn colors of the marsh\r\nvegetation, the ever-changing picture of sky and sea, the black terns\r\nand the swallows winnowing the meadows, the gulls and the terns over the\r\nsea and the flocks of small waders running over the mud flats. Suddenly\r\nhe is awakened from his reveries by the well-known note of the winter\r\nyellow-legs and discerns a mere speck in the distant sky; he whistles an\r\nimitation of its note; the bird answers him and, looking for\r\ncompanionship, circles nearer; by judicious calling the bird is\r\nattracted within sight of the decoys and, after several cautious\r\ncirclings, it sets its wings and scales down to the decoys, where it\r\nmeets its fate. Perhaps a whole flock may slip in unexpectedly, wheel\r\nover the decoys and hurry away, giving the gunner only a hurried chance\r\nfor a quick shot. Perhaps a curlew may fly over or a flock of\r\nbeetle-heads fly swiftly by; the gunner must be ready for all such\r\nchances. There is an ever-changing panorama of bird life on the marshes,\r\nfull of surprises and delights for the nature lover.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--The greater yellow-legs has a wide winter range, from the\r\nsouthern United States, where it is comparatively rare, to southern\r\nSouth America, where most of the birds seem to go. W. H. Hudson (1920)\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     The greater yellow-legs is best known as an Arctic-American\r\n     species, descending south during migration, and arriving in La\r\n     Plata at the end of September or early in October, singly or in\r\n     pairs, and sometimes in small flocks. Without ever being abundant\r\n     the bird is quite common, and one can seldom approach a pool or\r\n     marsh on the pampas without seeing one or more individuals wading\r\n     near the margin, and hearing their powerful alarm cry--a long,\r\n     clear note repeated three times. These summer visitors leave us in\r\n     March, and then, oddly enough, others arrive, presumably from the\r\n     south to winter on the pampas, and remain from April to August.\r\n     Thus, notwithstanding that the yellow-shanks does not breed on the\r\n     pampas, we have it with us all the year 'round.\r\n\r\nDr. Alexander Wetmore (1926) saw it in Paraguay as early as September 8\r\nand in Chile as late as April 26. He writes:\r\n\r\n     After their arrival in September greater yellow-legs were\r\n     distributed throughout the open pampa wherever shallow ponds\r\n     offered suitable feeding places. Occasionally 10 or 20 gathered in\r\n     a flock, especially when northward migration was under way in March\r\n     and April, but when on their wintering grounds it was usual to find\r\n     two or three in company, seldom more. They are rather silent during\r\n     the winter season but when the northward journey begins are as\r\n     noisy as is their custom in the north. The species is large so that\r\n     it is attractive to pot hunters and many are killed. I saw a number\r\n     of crippled birds during the last two months of my stay in\r\n     Argentina and consider that it is these injured individuals, unable\r\n     to perform the necessary flight, or without desire to do so from\r\n     their injuries, that are recorded on the pampas from May to August\r\n     when all should be in the Northern Hemisphere. Reports of their\r\n     breeding in Argentina, based on the presence of these laggards in\r\n     migration are wholly unauthenticated.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that most of the birds that remain in the South\r\nfrom April to September are one-year-old birds which are not ready to\r\nbreed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North and South America.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The breeding range of the greater yellow-legs extends\r\nnorth to Alaska (Bethel); British Columbia (Fort St. James); Mackenzie\r\n(Peel River); Alberta (Island Lake); Manitoba (Kalcoala); Labrador\r\n(Whale River and Hopedale); and Newfoundland (Gaff Topsail).

The\r\nlesser is more abundant and less shy, hence rather better known. The\r\nseasonal names, applied to them by gunners, have been well chosen, as\r\nthe lesser comes to us in summer and the greater lingers with us almost\r\ninto winter. Both have the exasperating telltale habit of arousing the\r\nneighborhood by their loud cries of alarm.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--The lesser yellow-legs is a rare bird in New England in the\r\nspring. The main flight from South America passes through the West\r\nIndies to the Southern States and then northward through the Mississippi\r\nValley to the breeding grounds in central Canada. I have seen birds in\r\nFlorida as early as February 27; these may have been wintering birds,\r\nfor the main flight there comes during the latter part of March. I have\r\nseen birds in Texas as late as May 17. C. J. Pennock's migration dates\r\nfor Delaware run from April 23 to May 29, where it is a regular spring\r\nmigrant. Long Island marks about its northern limit on the Atlantic\r\ncoast in spring. It usually arrives in southern Manitoba about the\r\nmiddle or last of April; A. G. Lawrence sends me an unusually early\r\nrecord for Whitewater Lake, April 8, 1925. From the first to the middle\r\nof May it arrives on its breeding grounds in northern Alberta and\r\nfarther north, as far as the limit of trees. Dr. Joseph Grinnell (1900)\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     This proved to be a common bird in the Kowak Valley. Its arrival\r\n     was noted in the vicinity of our winter camp on May 19, and from\r\n     that day on its presence could hardly be overlooked, for as one\r\n     approached their domains the yellow-legs would fly to meet him,\r\n     uttering prolonged, monotonous cries. Besides these notes of alarm\r\n     the males had a full, melodious warble, sung for minutes at a time\r\n     as they flew slowly about overhead. Their favorite haunts appeared\r\n     to be the meadows lying between strips of timber, especially if\r\n     there was a shallow lake or pond in the vicinity.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--MacFarlane recorded in his notes some 30 nests of this\r\nyellow-legs, found by him and his men in the wooded country about Fort\r\nAnderson and its vicinity from 1862 to 1866. He speaks of it as \"a very\r\nnoisy bird\" that \"will keep going before one, from tree to tree, for\r\nseveral hundred yards beyond its nest.\" One nest is described as \"near a\r\nlake, a small hole in the ground, with a few decayed willow leaves\r\nunderneath the eggs\"; another nest was \"about 150 yards from a lake, on\r\na rising, thinly wooded piece of ground\"; another was \"on the face of a\r\nlow hill, or rising ground, in the midst of a tuft of hay, or rather of\r\na 'tête-de-femme,' made of a very few dead leaves in a depression\";\r\nothers were \"underneath or shaded by some stunted willows on the borders\r\nof a swampy tract, lined with a few withered grasses.\"\r\n\r\nJ. Fletcher Street (1923) has published an interesting account of the\r\nnesting habits of this species in Alberta, from which I quote as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     As Mr. Thomson had told us we found the chosen nesting site of the\r\n     yellow-legs to be on relatively high ground at an elevation from a\r\n     few feet to a possible 30 feet or more above the level of the\r\n     ponds. Invariably the nests were found not closer than 100 feet\r\n     from the water's edge and sometimes as far away as 200 yards.\r\n     Generally a sloping bank, a ridge or a level plateau was chosen for\r\n     the immediate nesting site. No nests were noted in the heavily\r\n     forested area; all of those secured in the region about Belvedere\r\n     being found among broken hills covered with burnt and fallen timber\r\n     with a second growth largely of low poplars, the burnt stubs\r\n     affording excellent perches for the birds. Therefore the assumption\r\n     would be that amid normal conditions the species would select\r\n     rather open and high woodlands with sparse, low undergrowth within\r\n     a reasonable distance of marshy or grassy ponds.\r\n\r\n     It is not until the full clutch of eggs is laid that the birds\r\n     show that degree of concern which leads to their undoing. Then\r\n     there is great excitement on the nesting grounds. The female bird\r\n     will fly about with drooping legs and tail, keeping up an\r\n     incessant _kip, kip_, and alighting upon near-by stubs. In this\r\n     the male will join her, but not to the same degree, frequently,\r\n     after the initial rally, flying away to the lake. His darker\r\n     breast markings and slightly larger size readily identify him. If\r\n     the observer retires and conceals himself the excitement of the\r\n     female will gradually subside, she will fly from stub to stub, at\r\n     length become silent, look about inquiringly and take a short\r\n     flight to the ground and run to the nest. After settling she may\r\n     be approached within 4 feet before flushing which she does with a\r\n     loud call of alarm. While on the nest she sits low and close.\r\n\r\n     The nest is a mere depression in the ground, lined with a few\r\n     leaves or a small amount of dry grass, the cup having a diameter of\r\n     3.5 to 4 inches and a depth of 1.25 to 1.50 inches. It may be\r\n     located next to a stub, along a prostrate log or in the open.\r\n\r\nRichard C. Harlow, who collected with Mr. Street in the same region,\r\ntells me that this bird will sometimes scratch out several hollows\r\nwithin a radius of 50 or 75 yards and line some of them with dry aspen\r\nleaves before laying in the one selected. Three of the nests found by\r\nMr. Harlow were close to or between fallen burnt logs and one was in a\r\nbushy situation in a clearing near the edge of some woods. The nests\r\nwere lined with dry leaves of poplar and aspen and a few dry grasses.\r\nOne set that he collected for me was at the base of a small bush on dry\r\nbarrens, half a mile from water. Richard H. Rauch in the same general\r\nlocality found a nest in what he calls an unusual location, 10 yards\r\nfrom the margin of a small lake in a very wet muskeg; the nest was a\r\ndepression in the moss, lined with a few dry birch leaves.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The yellow-legs lays four eggs, occasionally only three. These\r\nare ovate pyriform in shape and have a slight gloss. The ground colors\r\nusually vary from \"olive-buff\" to \"cream-buff\" and rarely from \"honey\r\nyellow\" to \"cartridge buff,\" or from \"light pinkish cinnamon\" to\r\n\"pinkish buff.\" The more richly colored eggs are often boldly and\r\nhandsomely marked. Some are quite evenly covered with small blotches and\r\nspots; others also have large, irregular blotches and splashes, chiefly\r\nabout the larger end and often with a spiral trend. These markings are\r\nin dark rich browns, \"chocolate,\" \"liver brown,\" \"bay,\" and \"chestnut\r\nbrown,\" sometimes deepening almost to black, where the pigment is\r\nthickest. Many large underlying blotches and spots of various shades of\r\n\"purple-drab\" and \"ecru-drab\" are conspicuous and add to the beauty of\r\nthe eggs. There is an albino egg in the national collection, creamy\r\nwhite with only a few small pale brown spots. The measurements of 51\r\neggs average 42 by 28.9 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes\r\nmeasure =45= by 30, 42 by =30.5=, =39.5= by 29.5, and 41 by =27.5=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Incubation is shared by both sexes, but we have no information\r\nas to its duration. MacFarlane found a pair of yellow-legs with three\r\nrecently hatched young \"in a small watery swamp,\" where the young were\r\nable to conceal themselves in the short grass. Mr. Street (1923) says:\r\n\r\n     Young were found for the first time on June 4. Both male and female\r\n     at this time were highly excited, the female approaching within 10\r\n     feet of us. All the young had left the nest and had taken refuge in\r\n     the shade of a log to escape the burning rays of the sun. No\r\n     eggshells were found in the nest or near by. As we retired from the\r\n     immediate locality the female flew down to the ground and softly\r\n     \"kipped\" as if to rally the scattered young. On the succeeding day\r\n     a nest was found which at 10 a. m. contained one young and two\r\n     eggs. At 12.30 p. m. all the birds had hatched and had left the\r\n     nest, being found quite a distance away. One bird was walking,\r\n     readily indicating that the migration to the water must start\r\n     within a few hours of the time that the young are out of the eggs.\r\n\r\nAfter June 6 all the same excitement that characterized the action of\r\nthe adult birds at the nesting site was transplanted to the meadow\r\nlands. One uninitiated in the ways of the species might easily suppose\r\nthat he was now upon the breeding grounds, for the young keep well\r\nconcealed and are difficult to discover. Perhaps the exhibition of the\r\nadults at this time and the secretive habits of the birds during the\r\nearly days of the mating have tended to keep the nesting habits of the\r\nlesser yellow-legs so long a mystery.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--In natal down the young yellow-legs is \"pinkish buff\" on\r\nthe back, shading off to \"cartridge buff\" on the crown, to paler buff on\r\nthe forehead and sides of the head and to pure white on the under parts;\r\nthere is an indistinct frontal black stripe; the crown is heavily\r\nmottled with brownish black; a black stripe extends from the bill\r\nthrough the eye to the nape; and there are three broad bands on the\r\ncenter and sides of the back and large patches on the rump and thighs of\r\nbrownish black.\r\n\r\nYoung birds develop rapidly, the juvenal plumage coming in first on the\r\nsides of the breast, scapulars, and wings. A young bird, taken July 10,\r\nis nearly fully grown; the crown and neck fully feathered, the breast\r\nnearly so, and the wings and tail nearly grown. In this fresh juvenal\r\nplumage the feathers of the crown are tipped with whitish, and those of\r\nthe back, scapulars, and wing coverts are edged, tipped, or notched with\r\npale buff to white.\r\n\r\nSubsequent molts and plumages are similar to and very much like those of\r\nthe greater yellow-legs. I have seen a number of birds in what I call\r\nthe first nuptial plumage migrating northward; they may breed in this\r\nplumage. I have seen several adults molting their primaries in January\r\nand February.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The favorite feeding grounds of the yellow-legs are on flat\r\nmarshes near the coast, where the grass is short and where the high\r\ncourse of tides or heavy rains leave the marshes partially covered, or\r\ndotted, with shallow pools or splashes; away from the coast it is\r\nequally at home in wet, short-grass marshes, mud flats, shallow ponds\r\nand even wet places in cultivated fields. In such places it walks about\r\nin an active manner, usually in shallow water, but often up to the full\r\nlength of its long legs, gleaning most of its food from the surface of\r\nthe water or mud and seldom probing for it. During one season on Monomoy\r\nlarge numbers of yellow-legs frequented the drier parts of the meadows\r\nwhere the long grass had been beaten down flat by the storms of the\r\nprevious winter. These places seemed to hold some strong attraction for\r\nthem, for they repeatedly returned after being driven off. While we\r\nremained partially concealed in some clumps of tall grass, they\r\nfrequently alighted near us and ran nimbly about over the flattened\r\ngrass, darting rapidly in various directions to pick up food. The grass\r\nwas full of minute grasshoppers and other small insects on which they\r\nwere feeding. Evidently this food was unusually abundant that season,\r\nfor I have never seen them there in any numbers since 1921.\r\n\r\nArthur H. Howell (1924) says that, in Alabama, \"this bird feeds mainly\r\non insects, including ants, bugs, flies, and grasshoppers, and on small\r\ncrustaceans, small fishes and worms.\" Dr. Alexander Wetmore (1916)\r\nreporting on the food of four birds, taken in Porto Rico, says that\r\n\"water boatmen found in each of the four make 57.5 per cent, and two\r\nstomachs contained nothing else. Crustacean remains, among which were\r\nseveral crabs, were identified in two stomachs, and make the remainder,\r\n42.5 per cent.\"\r\n\r\nThe contents of nine stomachs taken by Stuart T. Danforth (1925) in\r\nPorto Rico were examined:\r\n\r\n     Dytiscid larvae formed 26.6 per cent of the animal matter, and\r\n     Hydrophilid larvae, 1.8 per cent; Bloodworms, 5.1 per cent;\r\n     Planorbia snails, 5 per cent; Fleabeetles 1.1 per cent; Hydrophilid\r\n     adults, 3.1 per cent; Dytiscid adult, 0.7 per cent; grasshoppers,\r\n     0.22 per cent; Bupestrid beetle, 0.55 per cent; Lycosid spider,\r\n     0.55 per cent; Notonectidae, 1 per cent; fish scales, 0.33 per\r\n     cent; Carabid beetle (Stenous sp.), 0.55 per cent; and other\r\n     beetles, 3.2 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Either in flight or on the ground the two yellow-legs are\r\nso much alike that one is often mistaken for the other, unless a direct\r\ncomparison in size can be made. William Brewster (1925) has expressed it\r\nvery well, as follows:\r\n\r\n     The summer yellow-legs seems an exact counterpart of the winter in\r\n     respect to general appearance and behavior. It has the same firm,\r\n     measured step, when walking about in quest of food; the same\r\n     perfection of form and outlines, and grace of position, when\r\n     standing erect and watchful; the same habit of tilting its body and\r\n     alternately lengthening and shortening its neck with a bobbing\r\n     motion, when suspicious of danger and about to take wing. Its\r\n     flight, also, is essentially similar to that of its big cousin, but\r\n     somewhat slower and more buoyant, and hence not so suggestive of\r\n     momentum as that of the larger, heavier-bodied bird.\r\n\r\nThe lesser yellow-legs is more universally common than the greater and\r\nmore apt to associate with other species of small waders, where it\r\ntowers above them, as it stalks gracefully about on its long legs. It is\r\nmore apt to be seen in large flocks, though the flocks are seldom\r\ncompact and are usually much scattered, especially when feeding. And it\r\nis much less shy; although usually rather watchful and wary, not easily\r\napproached by a moving object, it is often surprisingly tame. If the\r\nobserver is sitting down and motionless, even in plain sight, the birds\r\nwill often fly back and forth over him or even alight on the ground near\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI have often seen yellow-legs bathing, but Aretas A. Saunders (1926)\r\ndescribes it better than I can, as follows:\r\n\r\n     To do this a bird would go to the deeper, clearer water forming the\r\n     mid-channel of the pond, the same spot where the black ducks bathed\r\n     earlier in the morning. There it would sit down in the water,\r\n     remaining still for a time. Then it would splash water over its\r\n     back and wings, duck its head, and sit still again. When sitting\r\n     thus in the water its tail was usually half spread, and resting on\r\n     or just under the water surface. When the bath was over the bird\r\n     would stand up, stretch its wings and then preen, taking care to go\r\n     over carefully all the feathers of the back, wing, and breast and\r\n     scratching with its toes those portions it could not reach with the\r\n     bill.\r\n\r\nHe observed them fighting also and says:\r\n\r\n     Why they should fight at this season of the year, when the mating\r\n     season was over and the food supply seemed abundant enough for all\r\n     comers, is not easily explained. Yet it was a common thing to see\r\n     two birds stand facing each other with heads and necks up, and\r\n     bills tilted at an angle a little above the horizontal. After\r\n     eyeing each other a short time, one would dart at the other,\r\n     apparently trying to get its bill above its opponent's and strike\r\n     at the latter's eyes. The second bird would dodge back and then\r\n     return the attempted blow. They never actually struck each other,\r\n     and after several such tiffs one bird would crouch down in front of\r\n     the other, the yellow-legs' way of surrendering, and the other bird\r\n     would stalk off and pick a fight with some other that had been\r\n     peacefully feeding. Sometimes the fight varied from this form and\r\n     the birds lowered their heads at the beginning like roosters and\r\n     then fluttered up into the air as they went at each other.\r\n\r\nThe well-known bobbing habit is well described in some notes sent to me\r\nby Francis H. Allen, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Watched one on a slough for about an hour. Method of bobbing was to\r\n     raise the head by stretching the neck and at the same time lower\r\n     the tail, the whole body being held rigid, then lower the head with\r\n     the bill pointing somewhat downward and raise the tail to normal.\r\n     The body seems to turn on a pivot, but the lengthening of the neck\r\n     is an independent movement.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--John T. Nichols has sent me some very elaborate notes on the\r\nvaried calls of the yellow-legs, from which I quote as follows:\r\n\r\n     When on the ground in flocks the lesser yellow-legs is usually\r\n     silent. The same is true frequently of single birds coming in. In\r\n     the air it is more or less noisy and has two common, distinct\r\n     notes--_wheu_ and _kip_ or _keup_, which seem to be used rather\r\n     indiscriminately on various occasions and which vary into one\r\n     another. Wandering singles and small companies seem to use the\r\n     _wheu_ more, often double. The combination _wheu hip_ is frequent.\r\n     From large companies, especially in uncertainty, one may hear a\r\n     chorus of _kips_.\r\n     (1) The yodle probably corresponds in significance with that of the\r\n     greater yellow-legs--_location_. It is certainly its homolog and\r\n     scarcely, if at all, distinguishable from it. When a flock of a\r\n     half dozen lesser yellow-legs came to decoys, one bird alighted\r\n     first, had a low-pitched, unfamiliar _too-dle-hoo-hoo,\r\n     too-dle-hoo-hoo, too-dle-hoo-hoo_, before the others, still on the\r\n     wing, came back and alighted with it. Though probably of similar\r\n     derivation, this note was quite different from the yodle of the\r\n     species, and is probably more of a gather call (Long Island,\r\n     August).\r\n\r\n(2) The _wheu_ is a regular _flight note_, likely advertisement.\r\nGenerally silent birds alighted, sometimes call an occasional single\r\n_wheu_ (at such times particularly soft and mellow) before others drop\r\nin to join them, as if in welcome.\r\n\r\nWhen double this note of the lesser yellow-legs is at times clear and\r\nfull, difficult to differentiate from that of the larger species, and\r\napparently likewise characteristic of a \"gentle\" bird, which will join\r\ndecoys or others alighted.\r\n\r\n(5) Whereas the _wheu_ note of the lesser yellow-legs is most frequently\r\nsingle and very seldom more than double, I have heard a variation of it\r\nin series from one of an alighted flock (Mastic, July 13, 1919),\r\n_hyu-hyu-hyu-hyu-hyu_, etc. Presumably this was in protest at my\r\npresence, corresponding to the similar note of the larger species.\r\n\r\n(6) Soft, unloud murmuring of a flock in chorus, _yu yu yu_, etc.,\r\ncharacteristically heard, as on August 10, 1919, from a flock moving\r\nleisurely over the meadows, after having been flushed, to shortly alight\r\nagain, expressive of _companionship_ and confidence.\r\n\r\n(7) When dropping down to alight, often hovering over decoys, a flock of\r\nlesser yellow-legs has soft short _cup, cup, cup_, etc., notes.\r\n\r\n(8) At the instant of flushing almost the identical notes as above given\r\nhurriedly with more emphasis. This for the lesser yellow-legs is a rough\r\nanalog of the cheeping note of the pectoral sandpiper, but in view of\r\nthe different habits of the two species, can not be said to be strictly\r\nanalogous with same.\r\n\r\n(10) An unloud chuckle or series of short notes suggesting a very\r\ndistant jack curlew, heard sometimes, not very frequently, when one or\r\nmore birds take wing. Should probably be considered a flushing note or\r\nsignal to take wing. Seems like the attempt of one individual to\r\nreproduce the preceding, which is often from several birds of a flock.\r\n\r\n(11) The _kip_ is likely one bird calling to another close-by. It is\r\ntypically a _flocking_ note, otherwise used almost exactly as is note\r\nNo. 2. A variation, _keup_, with broader sound, approaching the _wheu_,\r\nexpressing _attention_, is frequent. It has been heard from a flock of\r\nbirds which had been resting and bathing, just before taking wing\r\n(Mastic, September 15, 1918).\r\n\r\n(12) An infrequent note of quite different character from the lesser\r\nyellow-legs' ordinary calls is very high and clear, _queep_. It is\r\nsubject to much variation, as _peep-quip, eep_! but is characterized by\r\nthe high _ee_ sound. It has been heard from birds alighted, more\r\nparticularly when their companions, alarmed or for some other reason,\r\nmove on, and is thought of as the _tarrying individual's_ note. On\r\nAugust 17, 1919, I had picked up decoys preparatory to leaving a pool in\r\nthe meadows when a single lesser yellow-legs came down to the pool\r\ncalling a similar _kee-a_ on the wing, though I was in full view. It\r\nwent on without alighting with _wheu_ notes characteristic of the\r\nspecies. Probably this was an individual which wanted to stay, from a\r\nsmall company which had left the meadow.\r\n\r\n(13) Wounded birds, on being pursued and captured, have a harsh scream\r\nof fear, _chee-rp_. I have noticed this from birds of the year in\r\nsouthward migration only, not from adults under the same circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe above numbers indicate notes analogous with those of the greater\r\nyellow-legs, similarly numbered. Where the lesser has no notes\r\nanalogous with certain notes of the greater, these numbers are omitted.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--There is no conspicuous character, except size, by which\r\nthe lesser yellow-legs can be distinguished in life from the greater,\r\nunless one is expert enough to recognize the notes, which are varied and\r\nvariable in both species. From nearly all other species it can be\r\ndistinguished by its slender, shapely head and neck and by its long,\r\nconspicuously yellow legs. Its light, almost white, tail and rump\r\ncontrast conspicuously with its uniformly dark back and wings; adults in\r\nworn nuptial plumage appear almost black on the upper parts; and there\r\nis no conspicuous white mark in the wings. The lesser yellow-legs is\r\nmost likely to be confused with the long-legged stilt sandpiper in\r\nimmature plumage; but the latter is somewhat smaller and has\r\nolive-colored legs instead of yellow. Adult stilt sandpipers, before\r\nthey have entirely lost the barred under parts, can be recognized by\r\nthese marks and by other characters described under that species.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Adult summer yellow-legs in worn nuptial plumage reach New\r\nEngland in July, thus deserving the name. My earliest date is July 11,\r\nbut they are often abundant before the end of that month. The young\r\nbirds appear about a month later; the loose flocks are made up of both\r\nages in August; the adults usually depart before the end of August, and\r\nfew young birds are left after the middle of September.\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols says in his notes:\r\n\r\n     It has frequently been remarked by old shore-bird gunners on Long\r\n     Island that the lesser yellow-legs and other species of shore birds\r\n     in southward migration are abundant early in the season, and then\r\n     after a period of comparative scarcity become again more numerous.\r\n     The explanation most commonly advanced for this condition is two\r\n     flights, first the old, then the young birds. It is unquestionable\r\n     that the first birds to come south are adults, but beyond that fact\r\n     this hypothesis will not hold.\r\n\r\n     The fluctuation in numbers of the shore birds on Long Island\r\n     during the fall migration period may best be explained by\r\n     supposing that the bulk of each species has a more or less\r\n     definite late-summer range to which it travels from the breeding\r\n     grounds and where, if conditions are favorable, it remains until\r\n     autumn. Before the main flight, birds of each species are mostly\r\n     adults, during it, mixed adults and young. To explain double\r\n     abundance of most species in southward migration by first the\r\n     passage of adults, then that of young, is pretty surely erroneous.\r\n     Where such double abundance does occur it is probably first birds\r\n     passing through, second birds stopping to feed.\r\n\r\n     There are not infrequent records of southbound lesser yellow-legs\r\n     on Long Island the end of June (June 24, 1922, my earliest at\r\n     Mastic), and I have seen a flock of 40 or 50 by July 10; July 31\r\n     is the earliest mention I chance to find in my notes of a bird of\r\n     the year.\r\n\r\nThere is probably a considerable and regular migration at sea for Capt.\r\nSavile G. Reid (1884) says that in Bermuda this is \"the most\r\nconspicuous and noisy of the August arrivals. It has been seen as early\r\nas July 13, but usually disappears toward the end of September.\r\nConsiderable numbers fall victims to the gun, as they are not bad\r\neating.\"\r\n\r\nC. J. Pennock has noted it in Delaware as late as October 12, and has\r\nseen it in Florida as early as September 16. It is an abundant migrant\r\nin the interior. Edward S. Thomas tells me that in Ohio the average fall\r\nmigration dates are between August 3 and October 16; he has a very late\r\nrecord of a specimen collected on November 29, 1923. From the prairie\r\nProvinces of Canada the main flight departs in August, but A. G.\r\nLawrence gives me September 29, 1923, as his latest date.\r\n\r\nJ. A. Munro tells me that it is \"an abundant autumn migrant\" at Okanagan\r\nLanding, British Columbia; his dates run from July 9 to September 1.\r\nThis species seems to be a rare migrant on the coasts of Washington and\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n_Game._--The summer yellow-legs has always been a popular game bird and\r\nhas always been counted in the class of \"big birds.\" It is still fairly\r\nabundant, but occurs in nothing like its former numbers. Giraud (1844)\r\nwas informed by a noted gunner \"that he killed 106 yellow-shanks by\r\ndischarging both barrels of his gun into a flock while they were sitting\r\nalong the beach.\" No such flocks occur to-day. However, they are not all\r\ngone, for Stuart T. Danforth (1925) says that at Cartagena Lagoon, Porto\r\nRico,\r\n\r\n     they occur in flocks of from 2 to 100. They reach their greatest\r\n     abundance early in October. On October 7 and 11, 1924, I observed\r\n     over 1,000, and on other days shortly before and after these dates\r\n     from 500 to 800. Usually there are not over 100 present at once.\r\n     They feed in the shallow open water, on the mud flats, and among\r\n     the flooded grasses and sedges. They often associate with other\r\n     sandpipers, especially the greater yellow-legs, stilt, and\r\n     semipalmated sandpipers. They are surprisingly tame while in Porto\r\n     Rico, and it is slaughter, not sport, to shoot them. Sometimes the\r\n     flocks are so densely packed that hunters kill as many as 20 at a\r\n     single shot.\r\n\r\nI have never felt that the summer yellow-legs should be in the game-bird\r\nclass, though I must confess that it has some gamey qualities. It is, at\r\ntimes, absurdly tame; it decoys very easily, returns again and again to\r\nthe slaughter, and its little body is so small that many lives must be\r\nsacrificed to make a decent bag. However, it _is_ interesting sport to\r\nsit in a well-made blind on a marsh, with decoys skillfully arranged,\r\nand show one's skill in whistling up these lively and responsive little\r\nbirds. After all, gunning is not so much a means of filling up the\r\nlarder as an excuse for getting out to enjoy the beauties of nature and\r\nthe ways of its wild creatures.\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols explains how it is done on Long Island, where this species\r\nhas for many years furnished most of the shooting; he writes:\r\n\r\n     To the Long Island gunner the yellow-legs and its associates are\r\n     known as \"bay snipe.\" Various customs relating to their pursuit for\r\n     sport (sniping) have arisen in the course of the generations that\r\n     it has been in vogue. Imitation wooden birds (\"stool\") are set out\r\n     as decoys in the marshes over which the birds may be expected to\r\n     pass, and the gunner stations himself within range behind a blind\r\n     usually constructed of bushes. There is opportunity for\r\n     considerable skill in setting out the decoys, placing and\r\n     constructing the blind, imitating the cries of the various species\r\n     to draw them within range. Where possible the decoys are placed so\r\n     as to be seen from every direction against a surface of water; if\r\n     in a small pool scattered about, if in a larger water area,\r\n     directly off some projecting point so as not to be blanketed by the\r\n     land. The larger the show of decoys, the larger the flocks of birds\r\n     that will be tempted to respond to them, and one attempts to\r\n     scatter them so that each will stand apart, no three which are\r\n     close together will be in line. They all face more or less directly\r\n     into the wind as would alighted birds. Ideally the blind is placed\r\n     to windward of the rig of decoys. Approaching birds maneuver toward\r\n     it from down wind, and are so less likely to notice the gunner and\r\n     take alarm before coming within range.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Although a few lesser yellow-legs may spend the winter\r\noccasionally as far north as Louisiana and Florida, the main winter home\r\nis in southern South America and very few are to be found regularly\r\nnorth of that continent. A. H. Holland (1892) records it as fairly\r\ncommon throughout the year in Argentina but more numerous from October\r\nto February. Dr. Alexander Wetmore (1926), referring to the same general\r\nregion, writes:\r\n\r\n     The lesser yellow-legs was widespread in distribution after October\r\n     and was more abundant on the whole than _Totanus melanoleucus_. The\r\n     birds frequented the shores of open lagoons, shallow pools, or\r\n     coastal mud flats, and though found distributed singly or two or\r\n     three together it was not unusual to encounter them in larger bands\r\n     that might contain 100 individuals. On their wintering grounds they\r\n     were rather silent, but with the opening of northward migration\r\n     resumed their habit of uttering musical though noisy calls when\r\n     disturbed in any manner. On the pampas they congregated during\r\n     drier seasons about lagoons and flocks often sought refuge from the\r\n     violent winds that swept the open plains behind scant screens of\r\n     rushes. After any general rain these flocks dispersed to pools of\r\n     rain water in the pastures, where insect food was easily available.\r\n     The winter population was thus not stationary, but shifted\r\n     constantly with changes in the weather. By the first of March the\r\n     lesser yellow-legs had begun their northward movement and numbers\r\n     were found near Guamini, where they paused to rest after a\r\n     northward flight from Patagonia. In their case, as in that of other\r\n     migrant species from North America, it was instructive to note that\r\n     the migration southward came in September and October when the\r\n     birds traveled southward with the unfolding of the southern spring\r\n     and that the return northward was initiated by the approach of\r\n     rigorous weather in faraway Patagonia. Migrant flocks, many of\r\n     whose members offered sad evidence of inhospitable treatment at the\r\n     hands of Argentine gunners in the shape of broken or missing legs,\r\n     were noted on the plains of Mendoza, near the base of the Andes, in\r\n     March. And during early April the migration became a veritable rush\r\n     so that on the night of April 5, at Tucuman, the air was filled\r\n     with the cries of these and other waders in steady flight northward\r\n     above the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North and South America.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The yellow-legs breeds north to Alaska (Kowak River\r\nand Fort Yukon); Mackenzie (Fort Anderson, Rendezvous Lake, and Horton\r\nRiver); and Ungava (Fort George and Whale River).
